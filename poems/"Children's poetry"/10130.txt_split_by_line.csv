32,INTRODUCTION,
33,INTRODUCTION,The present volume contains all the stories and verses for children
34,INTRODUCTION,which we know Charles and Mary Lamb to have written. The text is that
35,INTRODUCTION,"of the first or second editions, as explained in the Notes. _The"
36,INTRODUCTION,Poetry for Children_ and _Prince Dorus_ have been set up from the late
37,INTRODUCTION,Andrew W. Tuer's facsimiles. The large edition of this volume contains
38,INTRODUCTION,"all the original pictures, together with the apochryphal _Beauty and"
39,INTRODUCTION,the Beast_.
40,INTRODUCTION,
41,INTRODUCTION,In Mr. Bedford's design for the cover of this edition certain Elian
42,INTRODUCTION,symbolism will be found. The upper coat of arms is that of Christ's
43,INTRODUCTION,"Hospital, where Lamb was at school; the lower is that of the Inner"
44,INTRODUCTION,"Temple, where he was born and spent many years. The figures at the"
45,INTRODUCTION,bells are those which once stood out from the façade of St. Dunstan's
46,INTRODUCTION,"Church in Fleet Street, and are now in Lord Londesborough's garden in"
47,INTRODUCTION,Regent's Park. Lamb shed tears when they were removed. The tricksy
48,INTRODUCTION,sprite and the candles (brought by Betty) need no explanatory words of
49,INTRODUCTION,mine.

251,PREFACE,PREFACE
252,PREFACE,
253,PREFACE,
254,PREFACE,The following Tales are meant to be submitted to the young reader as
255,PREFACE,"an introduction to the study of Shakespear, for which purpose, his"
256,PREFACE,words are used whenever it seemed possible to bring them in; and in
257,PREFACE,whatever has been added to give them the regular form of a connected
258,PREFACE,"story, diligent care has been taken to select such words as might"
259,PREFACE,least interrupt the effect of the beautiful English tongue in which
260,PREFACE,he wrote: therefore words introduced into our language since his time
261,PREFACE,have been as far as possible avoided.
262,PREFACE,
263,PREFACE,"In those Tales which have been taken from the Tragedies, as my young"
264,PREFACE,readers will perceive when they come to see the source from which
265,PREFACE,"these stories are derived, Shakespear's own words, with little"
266,PREFACE,"alteration, recur very frequently in the narrative as well as in the"
267,PREFACE,dialogue; but in those made from the Comedies I found myself scarcely
268,PREFACE,ever able to turn his words into the narrative form; therefore I fear
269,PREFACE,in them I have made use of dialogue too frequently for young people
270,PREFACE,"not used to the dramatic form of writing. But this fault, if it be as"
271,PREFACE,"I fear a fault, has been caused by my earnest wish to give as much of"
272,PREFACE,"Shakespear's own words as possible: and if the ""_He said_"" and ""_She"
273,PREFACE,"said_"" the question and the reply, should sometimes seem tedious to"
274,PREFACE,"their young ears, they must pardon it, because it was the only way I"
275,PREFACE,"knew of, in which I could give them a few hints and little foretastes"
276,PREFACE,"of the great pleasure which awaits them in their elder years, when"
277,PREFACE,they come to the rich treasures from which these small and valueless
278,PREFACE,coins are extracted; pretending to no other merit than as faint and
279,PREFACE,imperfect stamps of Shakespear's matchless image. Faint and imperfect
280,PREFACE,"images they must be called, because the beauty of his language is"
281,PREFACE,too frequently destroyed by the necessity of changing many of his
282,PREFACE,"excellent words into words far less expressive of his true sense,"
283,PREFACE,"to make it read something like prose; and even in some few places,"
284,PREFACE,"where his blank verse is given unaltered, as hoping from its simple"
285,PREFACE,plainness to cheat the young readers into the belief that they are
286,PREFACE,"reading prose, yet still his language being transplanted from its own"
287,PREFACE,"natural soil and wild poetic garden, it must want much of its native"
288,PREFACE,beauty.
289,PREFACE,
290,PREFACE,I have wished to make these Tales easy reading for very young
291,PREFACE,children. To the utmost of my ability I have constantly kept this in
292,PREFACE,my mind; but the subjects of most of them made this a very difficult
293,PREFACE,task. It was no easy matter to give the histories of men and women in
294,PREFACE,terms familiar to the apprehension of a very young mind. For young
295,PREFACE,"ladies too it has been my intention chiefly to write, because boys"
296,PREFACE,are generally permitted the use of their fathers' libraries at a much
297,PREFACE,"earlier age than girls are, they frequently having the best scenes of"
298,PREFACE,"Shakespear by heart, before their sisters are permitted to look into"
299,PREFACE,"this manly book; and therefore, instead of recommending these Tales to"
300,PREFACE,the perusal of young gentlemen who can read them so much better in the
301,PREFACE,"originals, I must rather beg their kind assistance in explaining to"
302,PREFACE,their sisters such parts as are hardest for them to understand; and
303,PREFACE,"when they have helped them to get over the difficulties, then perhaps"
304,PREFACE,they will read to them (carefully selecting what is proper for a young
305,PREFACE,sister's ear) some passage which has pleased them in one of these
306,PREFACE,"stories, in the very words of the scene from which it is taken; and I"
307,PREFACE,"trust they will find that the beautiful extracts, the select passages,"
308,PREFACE,"they may chuse to give their sisters in this way, will be much better"
309,PREFACE,relished and understood from their having some notion of the general
310,PREFACE,story from one of these imperfect abridgments:--which if they be
311,PREFACE,"fortunately so done as to prove delightful to any of you, my young"
312,PREFACE,"readers, I hope will have no worse effect upon you, than to make"
313,PREFACE,"you wish yourselves a little older, that you may be allowed to read"
314,PREFACE,the Plays at full length (such a wish will be neither peevish nor
315,PREFACE,irrational). When time and leave of judicious friends shall put
316,PREFACE,"them into your hands, you will discover in such of them as are here"
317,PREFACE,abridged (not to mention almost as many more which are left untouched)
318,PREFACE,"many surprising events and turns of fortune, which for their infinite"
319,PREFACE,"variety could not be contained in this little book, besides a world of"
320,PREFACE,"sprightly and cheerful characters, both men and women, the humour of"
321,PREFACE,which I was fearful of losing if I attempted to reduce the length of
322,PREFACE,them.
323,PREFACE,
324,PREFACE,"What these Tales have been to you in childhood, that and much more it"
325,PREFACE,is my wish that the true Plays of Shakespear may prove to you in older
326,PREFACE,"years--enrichers of the fancy, strengtheners of virtue, a withdrawing"
327,PREFACE,"from all selfish and mercenary thoughts, a lesson of all sweet and"
328,PREFACE,"honourable thoughts and actions, to teach you courtesy, benignity,"
329,PREFACE,"generosity, humanity: for of examples, teaching these virtues, his"
330,PREFACE,pages are full.

336,THE TEMPEST,
337,THE TEMPEST,(_By Mary Lamb_)
338,THE TEMPEST,
339,THE TEMPEST,
340,THE TEMPEST,"There was a certain island in the sea, the only inhabitants of which"
341,THE TEMPEST,"were an old man, whose name was Prospero, and his daughter Miranda, a"
342,THE TEMPEST,"very beautiful young lady. She came to this island so young, that she"
343,THE TEMPEST,had no memory of having seen any other human face than her father's.
344,THE TEMPEST,
345,THE TEMPEST,"They lived in a cave or cell, made out of a rock: it was divided into"
346,THE TEMPEST,"several apartments, one of which Prospero called his study; there he"
347,THE TEMPEST,"kept his books, which chiefly treated of magic, a study at that time"
348,THE TEMPEST,much affected by all learned men: and the knowledge of this art he
349,THE TEMPEST,found very useful to him; for being thrown by a strange chance upon
350,THE TEMPEST,"this island, which had been inchanted by a witch called Sycorax, who"
351,THE TEMPEST,"died there a short time before his arrival, Prospero, by virtue of his"
352,THE TEMPEST,"art, released many good spirits that Sycorax had imprisoned in the"
353,THE TEMPEST,"bodies of large trees, because they had refused to execute her wicked"
354,THE TEMPEST,commands. These gentle spirits were ever after obedient to the will of
355,THE TEMPEST,Prospero. Of these Ariel was the chief.
356,THE TEMPEST,
357,THE TEMPEST,"The lively little sprite Ariel had nothing mischievous in his nature,"
358,THE TEMPEST,except that he took rather too much pleasure in tormenting an ugly
359,THE TEMPEST,"monster called Caliban, for he owed him a grudge because he was the"
360,THE TEMPEST,son of his old enemy Sycorax. This Caliban Prospero found in the
361,THE TEMPEST,"woods, a strange misshapen thing, far less human in form than an ape:"
362,THE TEMPEST,"he took him home to his cell, and taught him to speak; and Prospero"
363,THE TEMPEST,"would have been very kind to him, but the bad nature, which Caliban"
364,THE TEMPEST,"inherited from his mother Sycorax, would not let him learn any thing"
365,THE TEMPEST,"good or useful: therefore he was employed like a slave, to fetch"
366,THE TEMPEST,"wood, and do the most laborious offices; and Ariel had the charge of"
367,THE TEMPEST,compelling him to these services.
368,THE TEMPEST,
369,THE TEMPEST,"When Caliban was lazy and neglected his work, Ariel (who was invisible"
370,THE TEMPEST,"to all eyes but Prospero's) would come slyly and pinch him, and"
371,THE TEMPEST,"sometimes tumble him down in the mire; and then Ariel, in the likeness"
372,THE TEMPEST,"of an ape, would make mouths at him. Then swiftly changing his shape,"
373,THE TEMPEST,"in the likeness of a hedgehog he would lie tumbling in Caliban's way,"
374,THE TEMPEST,who feared the hedgehog's sharp quills would prick his bare feet. With
375,THE TEMPEST,"a variety of such-like vexatious tricks Ariel would often torment him,"
376,THE TEMPEST,whenever Caliban neglected the work which Prospero commanded him to
377,THE TEMPEST,do.
378,THE TEMPEST,
379,THE TEMPEST,"Having these powerful spirits obedient to his will, Prospero could by"
380,THE TEMPEST,"their means command the winds, and the waves of the sea. By his orders"
381,THE TEMPEST,"they raised a violent storm, in the midst of which, and struggling"
382,THE TEMPEST,"with the wild sea-waves that every moment threatened to swallow it up,"
383,THE TEMPEST,"he shewed his daughter a fine large ship, which he told her was full"
384,THE TEMPEST,"of living beings like themselves. ""O my dear father,"" said she, ""if by"
385,THE TEMPEST,"your art you have raised this dreadful storm, have pity on their sad"
386,THE TEMPEST,distress. See! the vessel will be dashed to pieces. Poor souls! they
387,THE TEMPEST,"will all perish. If I had power, I would sink the sea beneath the"
388,THE TEMPEST,"earth, rather than the good ship should be destroyed, with all the"
389,THE TEMPEST,"precious souls within her."""
390,THE TEMPEST,
391,THE TEMPEST,"""Be not so amazed, daughter Miranda,"" said Prospero; ""there is no harm"
392,THE TEMPEST,"done. I have so ordered it, that no person in the ship shall receive"
393,THE TEMPEST,"any hurt. What I have done has been in care of you, my dear child. You"
394,THE TEMPEST,"are ignorant who you are, or where you came from, and you know no more"
395,THE TEMPEST,"of me, but that I am your father, and live in this poor cave. Can you"
396,THE TEMPEST,"remember a time before you came to this cell? I think you cannot, for"
397,THE TEMPEST,"you were not then three years of age."""
398,THE TEMPEST,
399,THE TEMPEST,"""Certainly I can, sir,"" replied Miranda."
400,THE TEMPEST,
401,THE TEMPEST,"""By what?"" asked Prospero; ""by any other house or person? Tell me what"
402,THE TEMPEST,"you can remember, my child."""
403,THE TEMPEST,
404,THE TEMPEST,"Miranda said, ""It seems to me like the recollection of a dream. But"
405,THE TEMPEST,"had I not once four or five women who attended upon me?"""
406,THE TEMPEST,
407,THE TEMPEST,"Prospero answered, ""You had, and more. How is it that this still lives"
408,THE TEMPEST,"in your mind? Do you remember how you came here?"""
409,THE TEMPEST,
410,THE TEMPEST,"""No, sir,"" said Miranda, ""I remember nothing more."""
411,THE TEMPEST,
412,THE TEMPEST,"""Twelve years ago, Miranda,"" continued Prospero, ""I was duke of Milan,"
413,THE TEMPEST,"and you were a princess and my only heir. I had a younger brother,"
414,THE TEMPEST,"whose name was Antonio, to whom I trusted every thing; and as I was"
415,THE TEMPEST,"fond of retirement and deep study, I commonly left the management of"
416,THE TEMPEST,"my state affairs to your uncle, my false brother (for so indeed he"
417,THE TEMPEST,"proved). I, neglecting all worldly ends, buried among my books, did"
418,THE TEMPEST,dedicate my whole time to the bettering of my mind. My brother Antonio
419,THE TEMPEST,"being thus in possession of my power, began to think himself the duke"
420,THE TEMPEST,indeed. The opportunity I gave him of making himself popular among my
421,THE TEMPEST,"subjects, awakened in his bad nature a proud ambition to deprive me of"
422,THE TEMPEST,"my dukedom; this he soon effected with the aid of the king of Naples,"
423,THE TEMPEST,"a powerful prince, who was my enemy."""
424,THE TEMPEST,
425,THE TEMPEST,"""Wherefore,"" said Miranda, ""did they not that hour destroy us?"""
426,THE TEMPEST,
427,THE TEMPEST,"""My child,"" answered her father, ""they durst not, so dear was the love"
428,THE TEMPEST,"that my people bore me. Antonio carried us on board a ship, and when"
429,THE TEMPEST,"we were some leagues out at sea, he forced us into a small boat,"
430,THE TEMPEST,"without either tackle, sail, or mast: there he left us as he thought"
431,THE TEMPEST,"to perish. But a kind lord of my court, one Gonzalo, who loved me, had"
432,THE TEMPEST,"privately placed in the boat, water, provisions, apparel, and some"
433,THE TEMPEST,"books which I prize above my dukedom."""
434,THE TEMPEST,
435,THE TEMPEST,"""O my father,"" said Miranda, ""what a trouble must I have been to you"
436,THE TEMPEST,"then!"""
437,THE TEMPEST,
438,THE TEMPEST,"""No, my love,"" said Prospero, ""you were a little cherub that did"
439,THE TEMPEST,preserve me. Your innocent smiles made me to bear up against my
440,THE TEMPEST,"misfortunes. Our food lasted till we landed on this desert island,"
441,THE TEMPEST,"since when my chief delight has been in teaching you, Miranda, and"
442,THE TEMPEST,"well have you profited by my instructions."""
443,THE TEMPEST,
444,THE TEMPEST,"""Heaven thank you, my dear father,"" said Miranda. ""Now pray tell me,"
445,THE TEMPEST,"sir, your reason for raising this sea-storm."" ""Know then,"" said her"
446,THE TEMPEST,"father, ""that by means of this storm my enemies, the king of Naples,"
447,THE TEMPEST,"and my cruel brother, are cast ashore upon this island."""
448,THE TEMPEST,
449,THE TEMPEST,"Having so said, Prospero gently touched his daughter with his magic"
450,THE TEMPEST,"wand, and she fell fast asleep; for the spirit Ariel just then"
451,THE TEMPEST,"presented himself before his master, to give an account of the"
452,THE TEMPEST,"tempest, and how he had disposed of the ship's company; and, though"
453,THE TEMPEST,"the spirits were always invisible to Miranda, Prospero did not choose"
454,THE TEMPEST,she should hear him holding converse (as would seem to her) with the
455,THE TEMPEST,empty air.
456,THE TEMPEST,
457,THE TEMPEST,"""Well, my brave spirit,"" said Prospero to Ariel, ""how have you"
458,THE TEMPEST,"performed your task?"""
459,THE TEMPEST,
460,THE TEMPEST,"Ariel gave a lively description of the storm, and of the terrors of"
461,THE TEMPEST,"the mariners; and how the king's son, Ferdinand, was the first who"
462,THE TEMPEST,leaped into the sea; and his father thought he saw this dear son
463,THE TEMPEST,"swallowed up by the waves, and lost. ""But he is safe,"" said Ariel, ""in"
464,THE TEMPEST,"a corner of the isle, sitting with his arms folded sadly, lamenting"
465,THE TEMPEST,"the loss of the king his father, whom he concludes drowned. Not a hair"
466,THE TEMPEST,"of his head is injured, and his princely garments, though drenched in"
467,THE TEMPEST,"the sea-waves, look fresher than before."""
468,THE TEMPEST,
469,THE TEMPEST,"""That's my delicate Ariel,"" said Prospero. ""Bring him hither: my"
470,THE TEMPEST,"daughter must see this young prince. Where is the king, and my"
471,THE TEMPEST,"brother?"""
472,THE TEMPEST,
473,THE TEMPEST,"""I left them,"" answered Ariel, ""searching for Ferdinand, whom they"
474,THE TEMPEST,"have little hopes of finding, thinking they saw him perish. Of the"
475,THE TEMPEST,ship's crew not one is missing; though each one thinks himself the
476,THE TEMPEST,"only one saved: and the ship, though invisible to them, is safe in the"
477,THE TEMPEST,"harbour."""
478,THE TEMPEST,
479,THE TEMPEST,"""Ariel,"" said Prospero, ""thy charge is faithfully performed: bur there"
480,THE TEMPEST,"is more work yet."""
481,THE TEMPEST,
482,THE TEMPEST,"""Is there more work?"" said Ariel. ""Let me remind you, master, you"
483,THE TEMPEST,"have promised me my liberty. I pray, remember, I have done you worthy"
484,THE TEMPEST,"service, told you no lies, made no mistakes, served you without grudge"
485,THE TEMPEST,"or grumbling."" ""How now!"" said Prospero. ""You do not recollect what a"
486,THE TEMPEST,"torment I freed you from. Have you forgot the wicked witch Sycorax,"
487,THE TEMPEST,who with age and envy was almost bent double? Where was she born?
488,THE TEMPEST,"Speak; tell me."""
489,THE TEMPEST,
490,THE TEMPEST,"""Sir, in Algiers,"" said Ariel."
491,THE TEMPEST,
492,THE TEMPEST,"""O was she so?"" said Prospero. ""I must recount what you have been,"
493,THE TEMPEST,"which I find you do not remember. This bad witch Sycorax, for her"
494,THE TEMPEST,"witchcrafts, too terrible to enter human hearing, was banished from"
495,THE TEMPEST,"Algiers, and here left by the sailors; and because you were a spirit"
496,THE TEMPEST,"too delicate to execute her wicked commands, she shut you up in a"
497,THE TEMPEST,"tree, where I found you howling. This torment, remember, I did free"
498,THE TEMPEST,"you from."""
499,THE TEMPEST,
500,THE TEMPEST,"""Pardon me, dear master,"" said Ariel, ashamed to seem ungrateful; ""I"
501,THE TEMPEST,"will obey your commands."""
502,THE TEMPEST,
503,THE TEMPEST,"""Do so,"" said Prospero, ""and I will set you free."" He then gave orders"
504,THE TEMPEST,"what farther he would have him do, and away went Ariel, first to where"
505,THE TEMPEST,"he had left Ferdinand, and found him still sitting on the grass in the"
506,THE TEMPEST,same melancholy posture.
507,THE TEMPEST,
508,THE TEMPEST,"""O my young gentleman,"" said Ariel, when he saw him, ""I will soon move"
509,THE TEMPEST,"you. You must be brought, I find, for the lady Miranda to have a sight"
510,THE TEMPEST,"of your pretty person. Come, sir, follow me."" He then began singing,"
511,THE TEMPEST,
512,THE TEMPEST,"""Full fathom five thy father lies:"
513,THE TEMPEST,Of his bones are coral made;
514,THE TEMPEST,Those are pearls that were his eyes:
515,THE TEMPEST,"Nothing of him that doth fade,"
516,THE TEMPEST,But doth suffer a sea-change
517,THE TEMPEST,Into something rich and strange.
518,THE TEMPEST,Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:
519,THE TEMPEST,"Hark, now I hear them, ding-dong--bell."""
520,THE TEMPEST,
521,THE TEMPEST,This strange news of his lost father soon roused the prince from the
522,THE TEMPEST,stupid fit into which he had fallen. He followed in amazement the
523,THE TEMPEST,"sound of Ariel's voice, till it led him to Prospero and Miranda, who"
524,THE TEMPEST,were sitting under the shade of a large tree. Now Miranda had never
525,THE TEMPEST,"seen a man before, except her own father."
526,THE TEMPEST,
527,THE TEMPEST,"""Miranda,"" said Prospero, ""tell me what you are looking at yonder."""
528,THE TEMPEST,
529,THE TEMPEST,"""O father,"" said Miranda, in a strange surprise, ""surely that is a"
530,THE TEMPEST,"spirit. Lord! how it looks about! Believe me, sir, it is a beautiful"
531,THE TEMPEST,"creature. It is not a spirit?"""
532,THE TEMPEST,
533,THE TEMPEST,"""No, girl,"" answered her father; ""it eats, and sleeps, and has senses"
534,THE TEMPEST,such as we have. This young man you see was in the ship. He is
535,THE TEMPEST,"somewhat altered by grief, or you might call him a handsome person. He"
536,THE TEMPEST,"has lost his companions, and is wandering about to find them."""
537,THE TEMPEST,
538,THE TEMPEST,"Miranda, who thought all men had grave faces and grey beards like her"
539,THE TEMPEST,"father, was delighted with the appearance of this beautiful young"
540,THE TEMPEST,"prince; and Ferdinand, seeing such a lovely lady in this desert"
541,THE TEMPEST,"place, and from the strange sounds he had heard expecting nothing but"
542,THE TEMPEST,"wonders, thought he was upon an inchanted island, and that Miranda was"
543,THE TEMPEST,"the goddess of the place, and as such he began to address her."
544,THE TEMPEST,
545,THE TEMPEST,"She timidly answered, she was no goddess, but a simple maid, and was"
546,THE TEMPEST,"going to give him an account of herself, when Prospero interrupted"
547,THE TEMPEST,"her. He was well pleased to find they admired each other, for he"
548,THE TEMPEST,plainly perceived they had (as we say) fallen in love at first
549,THE TEMPEST,"sight: but to try Ferdinand's constancy, he resolved to throw some"
550,THE TEMPEST,"difficulties in their way: therefore advancing forward, he addressed"
551,THE TEMPEST,"the prince with a stern air, telling him, he came to the island as a"
552,THE TEMPEST,"spy, to take it from him who was the lord of it. ""Follow me,"" said he,"
553,THE TEMPEST,"""I will tie you, neck and feet together. You shall drink sea-water;"
554,THE TEMPEST,"shell-fish, withered roots, and husks of acorns, shall be your food."""
555,THE TEMPEST,"""No,"" said Ferdinand, ""I will resist such entertainment, till I see"
556,THE TEMPEST,"a more powerful enemy,"" and drew his sword; but Prospero, waving his"
557,THE TEMPEST,"magic wand, fixed him to the spot where he stood, so that he had no"
558,THE TEMPEST,power to move.
559,THE TEMPEST,
560,THE TEMPEST,"Miranda hung upon her father, saying, ""Why are you so ungentle? Have"
561,THE TEMPEST,"pity, sir; I will be his surety. This is the second man I ever saw,"
562,THE TEMPEST,"and to me he seems a true one."""
563,THE TEMPEST,
564,THE TEMPEST,"""Silence,"" said her father, ""one word more will make me chide you,"
565,THE TEMPEST,girl! What! an advocate for an impostor! You think there are no more
566,THE TEMPEST,"such fine men, having seen only him and Caliban. I tell you, foolish"
567,THE TEMPEST,"girl, most men as far excel this, as he does Caliban."" This he said to"
568,THE TEMPEST,"prove his daughter's constancy; and she replied, ""My affections are"
569,THE TEMPEST,"most humble. I have no wish to see a goodlier man."""
570,THE TEMPEST,
571,THE TEMPEST,"""Come on, young man,"" said Prospero to the prince, ""you have no power"
572,THE TEMPEST,"to disobey me."""
573,THE TEMPEST,
574,THE TEMPEST,"""I have not indeed,"" answered Ferdinand; and not knowing that it was"
575,THE TEMPEST,"by magic he was deprived of all power of resistance, he was astonished"
576,THE TEMPEST,to find himself so strangely compelled to follow Prospero; looking
577,THE TEMPEST,"back on Miranda as long as he could see her, he said, as he went after"
578,THE TEMPEST,"Prospero into the cave, ""My spirits are all bound up, as if I were in"
579,THE TEMPEST,"a dream; but this man's threats, and the weakness which I feel, would"
580,THE TEMPEST,"seem light to me, if from my prison I might once a day behold this"
581,THE TEMPEST,"fair maid."""
582,THE TEMPEST,
583,THE TEMPEST,Prospero kept Ferdinand not long confined within the cell: he soon
584,THE TEMPEST,"brought out his prisoner, and set him a severe task to perform, taking"
585,THE TEMPEST,"care to let his daughter know the hard labour he had imposed on him,"
586,THE TEMPEST,and then pretending to go into his study he secretly watched them
587,THE TEMPEST,both.
588,THE TEMPEST,
589,THE TEMPEST,Prospero had commanded Ferdinand to pile up some heavy logs of wood.
590,THE TEMPEST,"Kings' sons not being much used to laborious work, Miranda soon after"
591,THE TEMPEST,"found her lover almost dying with fatigue. ""Alas!"" said she, ""do not"
592,THE TEMPEST,"work so hard; my father is at his studies, he is safe for these three"
593,THE TEMPEST,"hours: pray, rest yourself."""
594,THE TEMPEST,
595,THE TEMPEST,"""O my dear lady,"" said Ferdinand, ""I dare not. I must finish my task"
596,THE TEMPEST,"before I take my rest."""
597,THE TEMPEST,
598,THE TEMPEST,"""If you will sit down,"" said Miranda, ""I will carry your logs the"
599,THE TEMPEST,"while."" But this Ferdinand would by no means agree to. Instead of a"
600,THE TEMPEST,"help, Miranda became a hindrance, for they began a long conversation,"
601,THE TEMPEST,so that the business of log-carrying went on very slowly.
602,THE TEMPEST,
603,THE TEMPEST,"Prospero, who had enjoined Ferdinand this task merely as a trial of"
604,THE TEMPEST,"his love, was not at his books, as his daughter supposed, but was"
605,THE TEMPEST,"standing by them invisible, to overhear what they said."
606,THE TEMPEST,
607,THE TEMPEST,"Ferdinand inquired her name, which she told, saying it was against her"
608,THE TEMPEST,father's express command she did so.
609,THE TEMPEST,
610,THE TEMPEST,Prospero only smiled at this first instance of his daughter's
611,THE TEMPEST,"disobedience, for having by his magic art caused his daughter to fall"
612,THE TEMPEST,"in love so suddenly, he was not angry that she shewed her love by"
613,THE TEMPEST,forgetting to obey his commands. And he listened well pleased to a
614,THE TEMPEST,"long speech of Ferdinand's, in which he professed to love her above"
615,THE TEMPEST,all the ladies he ever saw.
616,THE TEMPEST,
617,THE TEMPEST,"In answer to his praises of her beauty, which he said exceeded all"
618,THE TEMPEST,"the women in the world, she replied, ""I do not remember the face of"
619,THE TEMPEST,"any woman, nor have I seen any more men than you, my good friend, and"
620,THE TEMPEST,"my dear father. How features are abroad, I know not; but believe me,"
621,THE TEMPEST,"sir, I would not wish any companion in the world but you, nor can my"
622,THE TEMPEST,"imagination form any shape but yours that I could like. But, sir, I"
623,THE TEMPEST,"fear I talk to you too freely, and my father's precepts I forget."""
624,THE TEMPEST,
625,THE TEMPEST,"At this Prospero smiled, and nodded his head as much as to say, ""This"
626,THE TEMPEST,"goes on exactly as I could wish; my girl will be queen of Naples."""
627,THE TEMPEST,
628,THE TEMPEST,"And then Ferdinand, in another fine long speech (for young princes"
629,THE TEMPEST,"speak in courtly phrases), told the innocent Miranda he was heir to"
630,THE TEMPEST,"the crown of Naples, and that she should be his queen."
631,THE TEMPEST,
632,THE TEMPEST,"""Ah! sir,"" said she, ""I am a fool to weep at what I am glad of. I will"
633,THE TEMPEST,"answer you in plain and holy innocence. I am your wife, if you will"
634,THE TEMPEST,"marry me."""
635,THE TEMPEST,
636,THE TEMPEST,Prospero prevented Ferdinand's thanks by appearing visible before
637,THE TEMPEST,them.
638,THE TEMPEST,
639,THE TEMPEST,"""Fear nothing, my child,"" said he; ""I have overheard, and approve"
640,THE TEMPEST,"of all you have said. And, Ferdinand, if I have too severely used"
641,THE TEMPEST,"you, I will make you rich amends by giving you my daughter. All"
642,THE TEMPEST,"your vexations were but my trials of your love, and you have nobly"
643,THE TEMPEST,"stood the test. Then as my gift, which your true love has worthily"
644,THE TEMPEST,"purchased, take my daughter, and do not smile that I boast she is"
645,THE TEMPEST,"above all praise."" He then, telling them that he had business which"
646,THE TEMPEST,"required his presence, desired they would sit down and talk together,"
647,THE TEMPEST,till he returned; and this command Miranda seemed not at all disposed
648,THE TEMPEST,to disobey.
649,THE TEMPEST,
650,THE TEMPEST,"When Prospero left them, he called his spirit Ariel, who quickly"
651,THE TEMPEST,"appeared before him, eager to relate what he had done with Prospero's"
652,THE TEMPEST,"brother and the king of Naples. Ariel said, he had left them almost"
653,THE TEMPEST,"out of their senses with fear, at the strange things he had caused"
654,THE TEMPEST,"them to see and hear. When fatigued with wandering about, and famished"
655,THE TEMPEST,"for want of food, he had suddenly set before them a delicious banquet,"
656,THE TEMPEST,"and then, just as they were going to eat, he appeared visible before"
657,THE TEMPEST,"them in the shape of a harpy, a voracious monster with wings, and the"
658,THE TEMPEST,"feast vanished away. Then, to their utter amazement, this seeming"
659,THE TEMPEST,"harpy spoke to them, reminding them of their cruelty in driving"
660,THE TEMPEST,"Prospero from his dukedom, and leaving him and his infant daughter"
661,THE TEMPEST,"to perish in the sea; saying, that for this cause these terrors were"
662,THE TEMPEST,suffered to afflict them.
663,THE TEMPEST,
664,THE TEMPEST,"The king of Naples, and Antonio the false brother, repented the"
665,THE TEMPEST,injustice they had done to Prospero: and Ariel told his master he was
666,THE TEMPEST,"certain their penitence was sincere, and that he, though a spirit,"
667,THE TEMPEST,could not but pity them.
668,THE TEMPEST,
669,THE TEMPEST,"""Then bring them hither, Ariel,"" said Prospero: ""if you, who are but"
670,THE TEMPEST,"a spirit, feel for their distress, shall not I, who am a human being"
671,THE TEMPEST,"like themselves, have compassion on them? Bring them, quickly, my"
672,THE TEMPEST,"dainty Ariel."""
673,THE TEMPEST,
674,THE TEMPEST,"Ariel soon returned with the king, Antonio, and old Gonzalo in their"
675,THE TEMPEST,"train, who had followed him, wondering at the wild music he played in"
676,THE TEMPEST,the air to draw them on to his master's presence. This Gonzalo was
677,THE TEMPEST,the same who had so kindly provided Prospero formerly with books and
678,THE TEMPEST,"provisions, when his wicked brother left him, as he thought, to perish"
679,THE TEMPEST,in an open boat in the sea.
680,THE TEMPEST,
681,THE TEMPEST,"Grief and terror had so stupified their senses, that they did not know"
682,THE TEMPEST,"Prospero. He first discovered himself to the good old Gonzalo, calling"
683,THE TEMPEST,him the preserver of his life; and then his brother and the king knew
684,THE TEMPEST,"that he was the injured Prospero. Antonio with tears, and sad words of"
685,THE TEMPEST,"sorrow and true repentance, implored his brother's forgiveness, and"
686,THE TEMPEST,the king expressed his sincere remorse for having assisted Antonio
687,THE TEMPEST,"to depose his brother: and Prospero forgave them; and, upon their"
688,THE TEMPEST,"engaging to restore his dukedom, he said to the king of Naples, ""I"
689,THE TEMPEST,"have a gift in store for you too;"" and opening a door, shewed him his"
690,THE TEMPEST,"son Ferdinand, playing at chess with Miranda."
691,THE TEMPEST,
692,THE TEMPEST,Nothing could exceed the joy of the father and the son at this
693,THE TEMPEST,"unexpected meeting, for they each thought the other drowned in the"
694,THE TEMPEST,storm.
695,THE TEMPEST,
696,THE TEMPEST,"""O wonder!"" said Miranda, ""what noble creatures these are! It must"
697,THE TEMPEST,"surely be a brave world that has such people in it."""
698,THE TEMPEST,
699,THE TEMPEST,The king of Naples was almost as much astonished at the beauty and
700,THE TEMPEST,"excellent graces of the young Miranda as his son had been. ""Who is"
701,THE TEMPEST,"this maid?"" said he; ""she seems the goddess that has parted us, and"
702,THE TEMPEST,"brought us thus together."" ""No, sir,"" answered Ferdinand, smiling to"
703,THE TEMPEST,find his father had fallen into the same mistake that he had done when
704,THE TEMPEST,"he first saw Miranda, ""she is a mortal, but by immortal Providence she"
705,THE TEMPEST,"is mine; I chose her when I could not ask you, my father, for your"
706,THE TEMPEST,"consent, not thinking you were alive. She is the daughter to this"
707,THE TEMPEST,"Prospero, who is the famous duke of Milan, of whose renown I have"
708,THE TEMPEST,"heard so much, but never saw him till now: of him I have received a"
709,THE TEMPEST,"new life: he has made himself to me a second father, giving me this"
710,THE TEMPEST,"dear lady."""
711,THE TEMPEST,
712,THE TEMPEST,"""Then I must be her father,"" said the king; ""but oh! how oddly will it"
713,THE TEMPEST,"sound, that I must ask my child forgiveness."""
714,THE TEMPEST,
715,THE TEMPEST,"""No more of that,"" said Prospero: ""let us not remember our troubles"
716,THE TEMPEST,"past, since they so happily have ended."" And then Prospero embraced"
717,THE TEMPEST,"his brother, and again assured him of his forgiveness; and said that"
718,THE TEMPEST,"a wise, over-ruling Providence had permitted that he should be driven"
719,THE TEMPEST,"from his poor dukedom of Milan, that his daughter might inherit the"
720,THE TEMPEST,"crown of Naples, for that by their meeting in this desert island it"
721,THE TEMPEST,"had happened, that the king's son had loved Miranda."
722,THE TEMPEST,
723,THE TEMPEST,"These kind words which Prospero spoke, meaning to comfort his brother,"
724,THE TEMPEST,"so filled Antonio with shame and remorse, that he wept and was"
725,THE TEMPEST,unable to speak; and the kind old Gonzalo wept to see this joyful
726,THE TEMPEST,"reconciliation, and prayed for blessings on the young couple."
727,THE TEMPEST,
728,THE TEMPEST,"Prospero now told them that their ship was safe in the harbour, and"
729,THE TEMPEST,"the sailors all on board her, and that he and his daughter would"
730,THE TEMPEST,"accompany them home the next morning. ""In the meantime,"" says he,"
731,THE TEMPEST,"""partake of such refreshments as my poor cave affords; and for your"
732,THE TEMPEST,evening's entertainment I will relate the history of my life from my
733,THE TEMPEST,"first landing in this desert island."" He then called for Caliban to"
734,THE TEMPEST,"prepare some food, and set the cave in order; and the company were"
735,THE TEMPEST,astonished at the uncouth form and savage appearance of this ugly
736,THE TEMPEST,"monster, who (Prospero said) was the only attendant he had to wait"
737,THE TEMPEST,upon him.
738,THE TEMPEST,
739,THE TEMPEST,"Before Prospero left the island, he dismissed Ariel from his service,"
740,THE TEMPEST,"to the great joy of that lively little spirit; who, though he had been"
741,THE TEMPEST,"a faithful servant to his master, was always longing to enjoy his free"
742,THE TEMPEST,"liberty, to wander uncontrolled in the air, like a wild bird, under"
743,THE TEMPEST,"green trees, among pleasant fruits, and sweet-smelling flowers. ""My"
744,THE TEMPEST,"quaint Ariel,"" said Prospero to the little sprite when he made him"
745,THE TEMPEST,"free, ""I shall miss you; yet you shall have your freedom."" ""Thank you,"
746,THE TEMPEST,"my dear master,"" said Ariel; ""but give me leave to attend your ship"
747,THE TEMPEST,"home with prosperous gales, before you bid farewel to the assistance"
748,THE TEMPEST,"of your faithful spirit; and then, master, when I am free, how merrily"
749,THE TEMPEST,"I shall live!"" Here Ariel sung this pretty song:"
750,THE TEMPEST,
751,THE TEMPEST,"""Where the bee sucks, there suck I;"
752,THE TEMPEST,In a cowslip's bell I lie:
753,THE TEMPEST,There I couch when owls do cry.
754,THE TEMPEST,On the bat's back I do fly
755,THE TEMPEST,After summer merrily.
756,THE TEMPEST,"Merrily, merrily, shall I live now"
757,THE TEMPEST,"Under the blossom that hangs on the bough."""
758,THE TEMPEST,
759,THE TEMPEST,"Prospero then buried deep in the earth his magical books, and"
760,THE TEMPEST,"wand, for he was resolved never more to make use of the magic art."
761,THE TEMPEST,"And having thus overcome his enemies, and being reconciled to his"
762,THE TEMPEST,"brother and the king of Naples, nothing now remained to complete his"
763,THE TEMPEST,"happiness, but to revisit his native land, to take possession of his"
764,THE TEMPEST,"dukedom, and to witness the happy nuptials of his daughter Miranda and"
765,THE TEMPEST,"prince Ferdinand, which the king said should be instantly celebrated"
766,THE TEMPEST,"with great splendour on their return to Naples. At which place, under"
767,THE TEMPEST,"the safe convoy of the spirit Ariel, they after a pleasant voyage"
768,THE TEMPEST,soon arrived.

773,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
774,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
775,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,(_By Mary Lamb_)
776,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
777,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
778,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"There was a law in the city of Athens, which gave to its citizens the"
779,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,power of compelling their daughters to marry whomsoever they pleased:
780,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,for upon a daughter's refusing to marry the man her father had chosen
781,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"to be her husband, the father was empowered by this law to cause her"
782,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,to be put to death; but as fathers do not often desire the death of
783,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"their own daughters, even though they do happen to prove a little"
784,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"refractory, this law was seldom or never put in execution, though"
785,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,perhaps the young ladies of that city were not unfrequently threatened
786,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,by their parents with the terrors of it.
787,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
788,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"There was one instance, however, of an old man, whose name was Egeus,"
789,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,who actually did come before Theseus (at that time the reigning
790,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"duke of Athens), to complain that his daughter Hermia, whom he had"
791,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"commanded to marry Demetrius, a young man of a noble Athenian family,"
792,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"refused to obey him, because she loved another young Athenian, named"
793,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Lysander. Egeus demanded justice of Theseus, and desired that this"
794,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,cruel law might be put in force against his daughter.
795,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
796,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Hermia pleaded in excuse for her disobedience, that Demetrius had"
797,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"formerly professed love for her dear friend Helena, and that Helena"
798,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,loved Demetrius to distraction; but this honourable reason which
799,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,Hermia gave for not obeying her father's command moved not the
800,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,stern Egeus.
801,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
802,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Theseus, though a great and merciful prince, had no power to alter the"
803,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,laws of his country; therefore he could only give Hermia four days to
804,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"consider of it: and at the end of that time, if she still refused to"
805,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"marry Demetrius, she was to be put to death."
806,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
807,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"When Hermia was dismissed from the presence of the duke, she went to"
808,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"her lover Lysander, and told him the peril she was in, and that she"
809,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"must either give him up and marry Demetrius, or lose her life in four"
810,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,days.
811,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
812,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,Lysander was in great affliction at hearing these evil tidings; but
813,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,recollecting that he had an aunt who lived at some distance from
814,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Athens, and that at the place where she lived the cruel law could not"
815,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,be put in force against Hermia (this law not extending beyond the
816,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"boundaries of the city), he proposed to Hermia, that she should steal"
817,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"out of her father's house that night, and go with him to his aunt's"
818,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"house, where he would marry her. ""I will meet you,"" said Lysander, ""in"
819,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"the wood a few miles without the city; in that delightful wood, where"
820,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"we have so often walked with Helena in the pleasant month of May."""
821,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
822,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,To this proposal Hermia joyfully agreed; and she told no one of her
823,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,intended flight but her friend Helena. Helena (as maidens will do
824,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,foolish things for love) very ungenerously resolved to go and tell
825,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"this to Demetrius, though she could hope no benefit from betraying"
826,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"her friend's secret, but the poor pleasure of following her faithless"
827,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,lover to the wood; for she well knew that Demetrius would go thither
828,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,in pursuit of Hermia.
829,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
830,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"The wood, in which Lysander and Hermia proposed to meet, was the"
831,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,favourite haunt of those little beings known by the name of _Fairies_.
832,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
833,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Oberon the king, and Titania the queen, of the Fairies, with all their"
834,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"tiny train of followers, in this wood held their midnight revels."
835,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
836,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Between this little king and queen of sprites there happened, at this"
837,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"time, a sad disagreement: they never met by moonlight in the shady"
838,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"walks of this pleasant wood, but they were quarrelling, till all their"
839,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,fairy elves would creep into acorn-cups and hide themselves for fear.
840,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
841,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,The cause of this unhappy disagreement was Titania's refusing to
842,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"give Oberon a little changeling boy, whose mother had been Titania's"
843,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,friend: and upon her death the fairy queen stole the child from its
844,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"nurse, and brought him up in the woods."
845,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
846,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"The night on which the lovers were to meet in this wood, as Titania"
847,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"was walking with some of her maids of honour, she met Oberon attended"
848,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,by his train of fairy courtiers.
849,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
850,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania,"" said the fairy king. The queen"
851,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"replied, ""What, jealous Oberon, is it you? Fairies, skip hence; I"
852,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"have forsworn his company."" ""Tarry, rash fairy,"" said Oberon; ""am not"
853,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,I thy lord? Why does Titania cross her Oberon? Give me your little
854,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"changeling boy to be my page."""
855,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
856,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Set your heart at rest,"" answered the queen; ""your whole fairy"
857,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"kingdom buys not the boy of me."" She then left her lord in great"
858,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"anger. ""Well, go your way,"" said Oberon: ""before the morning dawns I"
859,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"will torment you for this injury."""
860,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
861,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Oberon then sent for Puck, his chief favourite and privy counsellor."
862,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
863,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Puck (or, as he was sometimes called, Robin Goodfellow) was a"
864,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"shrewd and knavish sprite, that used to play comical pranks in"
865,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,the neighbouring villages; sometimes getting into the dairies and
866,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"skimming the milk, sometimes plunging his light and airy form into"
867,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"the butter-churn, and while he was dancing his fantastic shape in the"
868,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"vessel, in vain the dairy-maid would labour to change her cream into"
869,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,butter: nor had the village swains any better success; whenever Puck
870,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"chose to play his freaks in the brewing-copper, the ale was sure to be"
871,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,spoiled. When a few good neighbours were met to drink some comfortable
872,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"ale together, Puck would jump into the bowl of ale in the likeness of"
873,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"a roasted crab, and when some old goody was going to drink, he would"
874,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"bob against her lips, and spill the ale over her withered chin; and"
875,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"presently after, when the same old dame was gravely seating herself"
876,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"to tell her neighbours a sad and melancholy story, Puck would slip"
877,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"her three-legged stool from under her, and down toppled the poor old"
878,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"woman, and then the old gossips would hold their sides and laugh at"
879,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"her, and swear they never wasted a merrier hour."
880,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
881,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Come hither, Puck,"" said Oberon to this little merry wanderer of the"
882,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"night; ""fetch me the flower which maids call _Love in Idleness_; the"
883,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,juice of that little purple flower laid on the eyelids of those who
884,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"sleep, will make them, when they awake, doat on the first thing they"
885,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,see. Some of the juice of that flower I will drop on the eyelids of my
886,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Titania, when she is asleep; and the first thing she looks upon when"
887,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"she opens her eyes she will fall in love with, even though it be a"
888,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"lion, or a bear, a meddling monkey, or a busy ape: and before I will"
889,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"take this charm from off her sight, which I can do with another charm"
890,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"I know of, I will make her give me that boy to be my page."""
891,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
892,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Puck, who loved mischief to his heart, was highly diverted with this"
893,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"intended frolic of his master, and ran to seek the flower; and while"
894,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Oberon was waiting the return of Puck, he observed Demetrius and"
895,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,Helena enter the woods: he overheard Demetrius reproaching Helena for
896,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"following him, and after many unkind words on his part, and gentle"
897,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"expostulations from Helena, reminding him of his former love and"
898,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"professions of true faith to her, he left her (as he said) to the"
899,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"mercy of the wild beasts, and she ran after him as swiftly as she"
900,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,could.
901,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
902,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"The fairy king, who was always friendly to true lovers, felt great"
903,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"compassion for Helena; and perhaps, as Lysander said they used to walk"
904,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"by moonlight in this pleasant wood, Oberon might have seen Helena in"
905,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,those happy times when she was beloved by Demetrius. However that
906,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"might be, when Puck returned with the little purple flower, Oberon"
907,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"said to his favourite, ""Take a part of this flower: there has been a"
908,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"sweet Athenian lady here, who is in love with a disdainful youth; if"
909,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"you find him sleeping, drop some of the love-juice in his eyes, but"
910,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"contrive to do it when she is near him, that the first thing he sees"
911,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,when he awakes may be this despised lady. You will know the man by the
912,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Athenian garments which he wears."" Puck promised to manage this matter"
913,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"very dextrously; and then Oberon went, unperceived by Titania, to her"
914,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"bower, where she was preparing to go to rest. Her fairy bower was a"
915,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"bank, where grew wild thyme, cowslips, and sweet violets, under a"
916,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"canopy of woodbine, musk-roses, and eglantine. There Titania always"
917,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,slept some part of the night; her coverlet the enamelled skin of a
918,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"snake, which, though a small mantle, was wide enough to wrap a fairy"
919,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,in.
920,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
921,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"He found Titania giving orders to her fairies, how they were to employ"
922,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"themselves while she slept. ""Some of you,"" said her majesty, ""must"
923,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"kill cankers in the musk-rose-buds, and some wage war with the bats"
924,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"for their leathern wings, to make my small elves coats; and some of"
925,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"you keep watch that the clamorous owl, that nightly hoots, come not"
926,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"near me: but first sing me to sleep."" Then they began to sing this"
927,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,song:--
928,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
929,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"You spotted snakes with double tongue,"
930,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;"
931,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Newts and blind-worms do no wrong,"
932,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,Come not near our Fairy Queen.
933,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Philomel, with melody,"
934,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Sing in our sweet lullaby,"
935,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby:"
936,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Never harm, nor spell, nor charm,"
937,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,Come our lovely lady nigh;
938,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,So good night with lullaby.
939,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
940,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"When the fairies had sung their queen asleep with this pretty lullaby,"
941,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"they left her, to perform the important services she had enjoined"
942,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"them. Oberon then softly drew near his Titania, and dropt some of the"
943,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"love-juice on her eye-lids, saying,"
944,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
945,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"What thou seest when thou dost wake,"
946,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,Do it for thy true-love take.
947,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
948,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"But to return to Hermia, who made her escape out of her father's house"
949,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"that night, to avoid the death she was doomed to for refusing to marry"
950,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Demetrius. When she entered the wood, she found her dear Lysander"
951,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"waiting for her, to conduct her to his aunt's house; but before they"
952,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"had passed half through the wood, Hermia was so much fatigued, that"
953,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Lysander, who was very careful of this dear lady, that had proved her"
954,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"affection for him even by hazarding her life for his sake, persuaded"
955,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"her to rest till morning on a bank of soft moss, and lying down"
956,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"himself on the ground at some little distance, they soon fell fast"
957,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"asleep. Here they were found by Puck, who seeing a handsome young man"
958,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"asleep, and perceiving that his clothes were made in the Athenian"
959,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"fashion, and that a pretty lady was sleeping near him, concluded that"
960,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,this must be the Athenian maid and her disdainful lover whom Oberon
961,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"had sent him to seek; and he naturally enough conjectured that, as"
962,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"they were alone together, she must be the first thing he would see"
963,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"when he awoke: so without more ado, he proceeded to pour some of the"
964,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"juice of the little purple flower into his eyes. But it so fell out,"
965,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"that Helena came that way, and, instead of Hermia, was the first"
966,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"object Lysander beheld when he opened his eyes: and strange to relate,"
967,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"so powerful was the love-charm, all his love for Hermia vanished away,"
968,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,and Lysander fell in love with Helena.
969,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
970,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Had he first seen Hermia when he awoke, the blunder Puck committed"
971,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"would have been of no consequence, for he could not love that"
972,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,faithful lady too well; but for poor Lysander to be forced by a fairy
973,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"love-charm to forget his own true Hermia, and to run after another"
974,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"lady, and leave Hermia asleep quite alone in a wood at midnight, was a"
975,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,sad chance indeed.
976,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
977,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Thus this misfortune happened. Helena, as has been before related,"
978,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,endeavoured to keep pace with Demetrius when he ran away so rudely
979,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"from her; but she could not continue this unequal race long, men"
980,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,being always better runners in a long race than ladies. Helena soon
981,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,lost sight of Demetrius; and as she was wandering about dejected
982,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"and forlorn, she arrived at the place where Lysander was sleeping."
983,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Ah!"" said she, ""this is Lysander lying on the ground: is he dead or"
984,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"asleep?"" Then gently touching him, she said, ""Good sir, if you are"
985,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"alive, awake."" Upon this Lysander opened his eyes, and (the love-charm"
986,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,beginning to work) immediately addressed her in terms of extravagant
987,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"love and admiration; telling her, she as much excelled Hermia in"
988,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"beauty as a dove does a raven, and that he would run through fire"
989,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"for her sweet sake; and many more such lover-like speeches. Helena,"
990,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"knowing Lysander was her friend Hermia's lover, and that he was"
991,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"solemnly engaged to marry her, was in the utmost rage when she heard"
992,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,herself addressed in this manner; for she thought (as well she might)
993,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"that Lysander was making a jest of her. ""Oh!"" said she, ""why was I"
994,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"born to be mocked and scorned by every one? Is it not enough, is it"
995,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"not enough, young man, that I can never get a sweet look or a kind"
996,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"word from Demetrius; but you, sir, must pretend in this disdainful"
997,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"manner to court me? I thought, Lysander, you were a lord of more true"
998,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"gentleness."" Saying these words in great anger, she ran away; and"
999,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Lysander followed her, quite forgetful of his own Hermia, who was"
1000,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,still asleep.
1001,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1002,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"When Hermia awoke, she was in a sad fright at finding herself alone."
1003,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"She wandered about the wood, not knowing what was become of Lysander,"
1004,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,or which way to go to seek for him. In the mean time Demetrius not
1005,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"being able to find Hermia and his rival Lysander, and fatigued with"
1006,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"his fruitless search, was observed by Oberon fast asleep. Oberon had"
1007,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"learnt by some questions he had asked of Puck, that he had applied"
1008,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"the love-charm to the wrong person's eyes; and now, having found"
1009,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"the person first intended, he touched the eyelids of the sleeping"
1010,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Demetrius with the love-juice, and he instantly awoke; and the first"
1011,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"thing he saw being Helena, he, as Lysander had done before, began"
1012,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"to address love-speeches to her: and just at that moment Lysander,"
1013,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,followed by Hermia (for through Puck's unlucky mistake it was now
1014,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"become Hermia's turn to run after her lover), made his appearance;"
1015,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"and then Lysander and Demetrius, both speaking together, made love to"
1016,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Helena, they being each one under the influence of the same potent"
1017,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,charm.
1018,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1019,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"The astonished Helena thought that Demetrius, Lysander, and her once"
1020,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"dear friend Hermia, were all in a plot together to make a jest of her."
1021,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1022,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,Hermia was as much surprised as Helena: she knew not why Lysander and
1023,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Demetrius, who both before loved her, were now become the lovers of"
1024,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,Helena; and to Hermia the matter seemed to be no jest.
1025,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1026,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"The ladies, who before had always been the dearest of friends, now"
1027,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,fell to high words together.
1028,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1029,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Unkind Hermia,"" said Helena, ""it is you have set Lysander on, to vex"
1030,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"me with mock praises; and your other lover Demetrius, who used almost"
1031,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"to spurn me with his foot, have you not bid him call me Goddess,"
1032,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Nymph, rare, precious, and celestial? He would not speak thus to me"
1033,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"whom he hates, if you did not set him on to make a jest of me. Unkind"
1034,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Hermia, to join with men in scorning your poor friend. Have you forgot"
1035,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"our school-day friendship? How often, Hermia, have we two, sitting"
1036,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"on one cushion, both singing one song, with our needles working the"
1037,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"same flower, both on the same sampler wrought; growing up together in"
1038,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"fashion of a double cherry, scarcely seeming parted? Hermia, it is not"
1039,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"friendly in you, it is not maidenly, to join with men in scorning your"
1040,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"poor friend."""
1041,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1042,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""I am amazed at your passionate words,"" said Hermia: ""I scorn you"
1043,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"not; it seems you scorn me."" ""Aye, do,"" returned Helena, ""persevere;"
1044,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"counterfeit serious looks, and make mouths at me when I turn my back;"
1045,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"then wink at each other, and hold the sweet jest up. If you had any"
1046,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"pity, grace, or manners, you would not use me thus."""
1047,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1048,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"While Helena and Hermia were speaking these angry words to each other,"
1049,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Demetrius and Lysander left them, to fight together in the wood for"
1050,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,the love of Helena.
1051,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1052,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"When they found the gentlemen had left them, they departed, and once"
1053,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,more wandered weary in the wood in search of their lovers.
1054,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1055,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"As soon as they were gone, the fairy king, who with little Puck"
1056,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"had been listening to their quarrels, said to him, ""This is your"
1057,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"negligence, Puck; or did you do this wilfully?"" ""Believe me, king of"
1058,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"shadows,"" answered Puck, ""it was a mistake: did not you tell me I"
1059,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"should know the man by his Athenian garments? However, I am not sorry"
1060,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"this has happened, for I think their jangling makes excellent sport."""
1061,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""You heard,"" said Oberon, ""that Demetrius and Lysander are gone to"
1062,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,seek a convenient place to fight in. I command you to overhang the
1063,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"night with a thick fog, and lead these quarrelsome lovers so astray in"
1064,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"the dark, that they shall not be able to find each other. Counterfeit"
1065,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"each of their voices to the other, and with bitter taunts provoke them"
1066,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"to follow you, while they think it is their rival's tongue they hear."
1067,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"See you do this, till they are so weary they can go no farther; and"
1068,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"when you find they are asleep, drop the juice of this other flower"
1069,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"into Lysander's eyes, and when he awakes he will forget his new love"
1070,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"for Helena, and return to his old passion for Hermia; and then the two"
1071,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"fair ladies may each one be happy with the man she loves, and they"
1072,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"will think all that has passed a vexatious dream. About this quickly,"
1073,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Puck; and I will go and see what sweet love my Titania has found."""
1074,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1075,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Titania was still sleeping, and Oberon seeing a clown near her, who"
1076,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"had lost his way in the wood, and was likewise asleep: ""This fellow,"""
1077,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"said he, ""shall be my Titania's truelove;"" and clapping an ass's head"
1078,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"over the clown's, it seemed to fit him as well as if it had grown upon"
1079,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"his own shoulders. Though Oberon fixed the ass's head on very gently,"
1080,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"it awakened him, and rising up, unconscious of what Oberon had done to"
1081,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"him, he went towards the bower where the fairy queen slept."
1082,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1083,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Ah! what angel is that I see?"" said Titania, opening her eyes, and"
1084,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"the juice of the little purple flower beginning to take effect; ""Are"
1085,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"you as wise as you are beautiful?"""
1086,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1087,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Why, mistress,"" said the foolish clown, ""if I have wit enough to find"
1088,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"the way out of this wood, I have enough to serve my turn."""
1089,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1090,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Out of the wood do not desire to go,"" said the enamoured queen. ""I am"
1091,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"a spirit of no common rate. I love you. Go with me, and I will give"
1092,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"you fairies to attend upon you."""
1093,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1094,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"She then called four of her fairies; their names were, Pease-blossom,"

1100,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"she to the clown, ""and let me play with your amiable hairy cheeks, my"

1102,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1103,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Where is Pease-blossom?"" said the ass-headed clown; not much"
1104,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"regarding the fairy queen's courtship, but very proud of his new"
1105,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,attendants.
1106,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,

1116,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,and take care the honey-bag break not; I should be sorry to have you
1117,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"overflown with a honey-bag. Where is Mustard-seed?"""
1118,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1119,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Here, sir,"" said Mustard-seed; ""what is your will?"""
1120,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1121,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Nothing,"" said the clown, ""good Mr. Mustard-seed, but to help Mr."
1122,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Pease-blossom to scratch: I must go to a barber's, Mr. Mustard-seed,"
1123,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face."""
1124,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1125,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""My sweet love,"" said the queen, ""what will you have to eat? I have a"
1126,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"venturous fairy shall seek the squirrel's hoard, and fetch you some"
1127,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"new nuts."""
1128,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1129,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""I had rather have a handful of dried pease,"" said the clown, who with"
1130,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"his ass's head had got an ass's appetite. ""But, I pray, let none of"
1131,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"your people disturb me, for I have a mind to sleep."""
1132,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1133,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"""Sleep, then,"" said the queen, ""and I will wind you in my arms. O how"
1134,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"I love you! how I doat upon you!"""
1135,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1136,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"When the fairy king saw the clown sleeping in the arms of his queen,"
1137,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"he advanced within her sight, and reproached her with having lavished"
1138,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,her favours upon an ass.
1139,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1140,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"This she could not deny, as the clown was then sleeping within her"
1141,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"arms, with his ass's head crowned by her with flowers."
1142,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1143,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"When Oberon had teased her for some time, he again demanded the"
1144,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"changeling-boy; which she, ashamed of being discovered by her lord"
1145,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"with her new favourite, did not dare to refuse him."
1146,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1147,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Oberon, having thus obtained the little boy he had so long wished for"
1148,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"to be his page, took pity on the disgraceful situation into which,"
1149,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"by his merry contrivance, he had brought his Titania, and threw some"
1150,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,of the juice of the other flower into her eyes; and the fairy queen
1151,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"immediately recovered her senses, and wondered at her late dotage,"
1152,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,saying how she now loathed the sight of the strange monster.
1153,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1154,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Oberon likewise took the ass's head from off the clown, and left him"
1155,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,to finish his nap with his own fool's head upon his shoulders.
1156,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1157,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Oberon and his Titania being now perfectly reconciled, he related to"
1158,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"her the history of the lovers, and their midnight quarrels; and she"
1159,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"agreed to go with him, and see the end of their adventures."
1160,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1161,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"The fairy king and queen found the lovers and their fair ladies, at no"
1162,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"great distance from each other, sleeping on a grass-plot; for Puck,"
1163,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"to make amends for his former mistake, had contrived with the utmost"
1164,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"diligence to bring them all to the same spot, unknown to each other;"
1165,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,and he had carefully removed the charm from off the eyes of Lysander
1166,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,with the antidote the fairy king gave to him.
1167,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1168,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Hermia first awoke, and finding her lost Lysander asleep so near her,"
1169,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"was looking at him, and wondering at his strange inconstancy. Lysander"
1170,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"presently opening his eyes, and seeing his dear Hermia, recovered his"
1171,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"reason which the fairy-charm had before clouded, and with his reason"
1172,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,his love for Hermia; and they began to talk over the adventures of the
1173,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"night, doubting if these things had really happened, or if they had"
1174,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,both been dreaming the same bewildering dream.
1175,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1176,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,Helena and Demetrius were by this time awake; and a sweet sleep having
1177,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"quieted Helena's disturbed and angry spirits, she listened with"
1178,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"delight to the professions of love which Demetrius still made to her,"
1179,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"and which, to her surprise as well as pleasure she began to perceive"
1180,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,were sincere.
1181,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1182,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"These fair night-wandering ladies, now no longer rivals, became"
1183,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,once more true friends; all the unkind words which had passed were
1184,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"forgiven, and they calmly consulted together what was best to be done"
1185,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"in their present situation. It was soon agreed that, as Demetrius had"
1186,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"given up his pretensions to Hermia, he should endeavour to prevail"
1187,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,upon her father to revoke the cruel sentence of death which had been
1188,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,passed against her. Demetrius was preparing to return to Athens for
1189,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"this friendly purpose, when they were surprised with the sight of"
1190,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"Egeus, Hermia's father, who came to the wood in pursuit of his runaway"
1191,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,daughter.
1192,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1193,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"When Egeus understood that Demetrius would not now marry his daughter,"
1194,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"he no longer opposed her marriage with Lysander, but gave his consent"
1195,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"that they should be wedded on the fourth day from that time, being the"
1196,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,same day on which Hermia had been condemned to lose her life; and on
1197,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,that same day Helena joyfully agreed to marry her beloved and now
1198,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,faithful Demetrius.
1199,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1200,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"The fairy king and queen, who were invisible spectators of this"
1201,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"reconciliation, and now saw the happy ending of the lovers' history"
1202,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"brought about through the good offices of Oberon, received so"
1203,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"much pleasure, that these kind spirits resolved to celebrate the"
1204,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,approaching nuptials with sports and revels throughout their fairy
1205,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,kingdom.
1206,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
1207,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"And now, if any are offended with this story of fairies and their"
1208,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"pranks, as judging it incredible and strange, they have only to think"
1209,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,"that they have been asleep and dreaming, and that all these adventures"
1210,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,were visions which they saw in their sleep: and I hope none of my
1211,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,readers will be so unreasonable as to be offended with a pretty
1212,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,harmless Midsummer Night's Dream.

1218,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1219,THE WINTER'S TALE,(_By Mary Lamb_)
1220,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1221,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1222,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Leontes, king of Sicily, and his queen, the beautiful and virtuous"
1223,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Hermione, once lived in the greatest harmony together. So happy was"
1224,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Leontes in the love of this excellent lady, that he had no wish"
1225,THE WINTER'S TALE,"ungratified, except that he sometimes desired to see again, and to"
1226,THE WINTER'S TALE,"present to his queen, his old companion and school-fellow, Polixenes,"
1227,THE WINTER'S TALE,king of Bohemia. Leontes and Polixenes were brought up together from
1228,THE WINTER'S TALE,"their infancy, but being by the death of their fathers called to"
1229,THE WINTER'S TALE,"reign over their respective kingdoms, they had not met for many"
1230,THE WINTER'S TALE,"years, though they frequently interchanged gifts, letters, and"
1231,THE WINTER'S TALE,loving embassies.
1232,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1233,THE WINTER'S TALE,"At length, after repeated invitations, Polixenes came from Bohemia to"
1234,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the Sicilian court, to make his friend Leontes a visit."
1235,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1236,THE WINTER'S TALE,At first this visit gave nothing but pleasure to Leontes. He
1237,THE WINTER'S TALE,recommended the friend of his youth to the queen's particular
1238,THE WINTER'S TALE,"attention, and seemed in the presence of his dear friend and old"
1239,THE WINTER'S TALE,companion to have his felicity quite completed. They talked over old
1240,THE WINTER'S TALE,"times; their school-days and their youthful pranks were remembered,"
1241,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and recounted to Hermione, who always took a cheerful part in these"
1242,THE WINTER'S TALE,conversations.
1243,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1244,THE WINTER'S TALE,"When after a long stay Polixenes was preparing to depart, Hermione, at"
1245,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the desire of her husband, joined her intreaties to his that Polixenes"
1246,THE WINTER'S TALE,would prolong his visit.
1247,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1248,THE WINTER'S TALE,And now began this good queen's sorrow; for Polixenes refusing to
1249,THE WINTER'S TALE,"stay at the request of Leontes, was won over by Hermione's gentle and"
1250,THE WINTER'S TALE,persuasive words to put off his departure for some weeks longer. Upon
1251,THE WINTER'S TALE,"this, although Leontes had so long known the integrity and honourable"
1252,THE WINTER'S TALE,"principles of his friend Polixenes, as well as the excellent"
1253,THE WINTER'S TALE,"disposition of his virtuous queen, he was seized with an ungovernable"
1254,THE WINTER'S TALE,"jealousy. Every attention Hermione showed to Polixenes, though by her"
1255,THE WINTER'S TALE,"husband's particular desire, and merely to please him, increased the"
1256,THE WINTER'S TALE,"unfortunate king's malady; and from being a loving and a true friend,"
1257,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and the best and fondest of husbands, Leontes became suddenly a savage"
1258,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and inhuman monster. Sending for Camillo, one of the lords of his"
1259,THE WINTER'S TALE,"court, and telling him of the suspicion he entertained, he commanded"
1260,THE WINTER'S TALE,him to poison Polixenes.
1261,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1262,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Camillo was a good man; and he, well knowing that the jealousy"
1263,THE WINTER'S TALE,"of Leontes had not the slightest foundation in truth, instead of"
1264,THE WINTER'S TALE,"poisoning Polixenes, acquainted him with the king his master's orders,"
1265,THE WINTER'S TALE,and agreed to escape with him out of the Sicilian dominions; and
1266,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Polixenes, with the assistance of Camillo, arrived safe in his own"
1267,THE WINTER'S TALE,"kingdom of Bohemia, where Camillo lived from that time in the king's"
1268,THE WINTER'S TALE,"court, and became the chief friend and favourite of Polixenes."
1269,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1270,THE WINTER'S TALE,The flight of Polixenes enraged the jealous Leontes still more; he
1271,THE WINTER'S TALE,"went to the queen's apartment, where the good lady was sitting with"
1272,THE WINTER'S TALE,"her little son Mamillus, who was just beginning to tell one of his"
1273,THE WINTER'S TALE,"best stories to amuse his mother, when the king entered, and taking"
1274,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the child away, sent Hermione to prison."
1275,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1276,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Mamillus, though but a very young child, loved his mother tenderly;"
1277,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and when he saw her so dishonoured, and found she was taken from him"
1278,THE WINTER'S TALE,"to be put into a prison, he took it deeply to heart, and drooped and"
1279,THE WINTER'S TALE,"pined away by slow degrees, losing his appetite and his sleep, till it"
1280,THE WINTER'S TALE,was thought his grief would kill him.
1281,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1282,THE WINTER'S TALE,"The king, when he had sent his queen to prison, commanded Cleomenes"
1283,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and Dion, two Sicilian lords, to go to Delphos, there to inquire of"
1284,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the oracle at the temple of Apollo, if his queen had been unfaithful"
1285,THE WINTER'S TALE,to him.
1286,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1287,THE WINTER'S TALE,"When Hermione had been a short time in prison, she was brought to bed"
1288,THE WINTER'S TALE,of a daughter; and the poor lady received much comfort from the sight
1289,THE WINTER'S TALE,"of her pretty baby, and she said to it, ""My poor little prisoner, I am"
1290,THE WINTER'S TALE,"as innocent as you are."""
1291,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1292,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Hermione had a kind friend in the noble-spirited Paulina, who was the"
1293,THE WINTER'S TALE,"wife of Antigonus, a Sicilian lord; and when the Lady Paulina heard"
1294,THE WINTER'S TALE,"her royal mistress was brought to bed, she went to the prison where"
1295,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Hermione was confined; and she said to Emilia, a lady who attended"
1296,THE WINTER'S TALE,"upon Hermione, ""I pray you, Emilia, tell the good queen, if her"
1297,THE WINTER'S TALE,"majesty dare trust me with her little babe, I will carry it to the"
1298,THE WINTER'S TALE,king its father; we do not know how he may soften at the sight of his
1299,THE WINTER'S TALE,"innocent child."" ""Most worthy madam,"" replied Emilia, ""I will acquaint"
1300,THE WINTER'S TALE,the queen with your noble offer; she was wishing to-day that she had
1301,THE WINTER'S TALE,"any friend who would venture to present the child to the king."" ""And"
1302,THE WINTER'S TALE,"tell her,"" said Paulina, ""that I will speak boldly to Leontes in"
1303,THE WINTER'S TALE,"her defence."" ""May you be for ever blessed,"" said Emilia, ""for your"
1304,THE WINTER'S TALE,"kindness to our gracious queen!"" Emilia then went to Hermione, who"
1305,THE WINTER'S TALE,"joyfully gave up her baby to the care of Paulina, for she had feared"
1306,THE WINTER'S TALE,that no one would dare venture to present the child to its father.
1307,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1308,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Paulina took the new-born infant, and forcing herself into the king's"
1309,THE WINTER'S TALE,"presence, notwithstanding her husband, fearing the king's anger,"
1310,THE WINTER'S TALE,"endeavoured to prevent her, she laid the babe at its father's feet,"
1311,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and Paulina made a noble speech to the king in defence of Hermione,"
1312,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and she reproached him severely for his inhumanity, and implored him"
1313,THE WINTER'S TALE,to have mercy on his innocent wife and child. But Paulina's spirited
1314,THE WINTER'S TALE,"remonstrances only aggravated Leontes's displeasure, and he ordered"
1315,THE WINTER'S TALE,her husband Antigonus to take her from his presence.
1316,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1317,THE WINTER'S TALE,"When Paulina went away, she left the little baby at its father's feet,"
1318,THE WINTER'S TALE,"thinking, when he was alone with it, he would look upon it, and have"
1319,THE WINTER'S TALE,pity on its helpless innocence.
1320,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1321,THE WINTER'S TALE,The good Paulina was mistaken; for no sooner was she gone than the
1322,THE WINTER'S TALE,"merciless father ordered Antigonus, Paulina's husband, to take the"
1323,THE WINTER'S TALE,"child, and carry it out to sea, and leave it upon some desert shore to"
1324,THE WINTER'S TALE,perish.
1325,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1326,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Antigonus, unlike the good Camillo, too well obeyed the orders of"
1327,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Leontes; for he immediately carried the child on ship-board, and put"
1328,THE WINTER'S TALE,"out to sea, intending to leave it on the first desert coast he could"
1329,THE WINTER'S TALE,find.
1330,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1331,THE WINTER'S TALE,"So firmly was the king persuaded of the guilt of Hermione, that he"
1332,THE WINTER'S TALE,"would not wait for the return of Cleomenes and Dion, whom he had sent"
1333,THE WINTER'S TALE,to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphos; but before the queen was
1334,THE WINTER'S TALE,"recovered from her lying-in, and from her grief for the loss of her"
1335,THE WINTER'S TALE,"precious baby, he had her brought to a public trial before all the"
1336,THE WINTER'S TALE,"lords and nobles of his court. And when all the great lords, the"
1337,THE WINTER'S TALE,"judges, and all the nobility of the land were assembled together to"
1338,THE WINTER'S TALE,"try Hermione, and that unhappy queen was standing as a prisoner before"
1339,THE WINTER'S TALE,"her subjects to receive their judgment, Cleomenes and Dion entered the"
1340,THE WINTER'S TALE,"assembly, and presented to the king the answer of the oracle sealed"
1341,THE WINTER'S TALE,"up; and Leontes commanded the seal to be broken, and the words of"
1342,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the oracle to be read aloud, and these were the words:--""_Hermione"
1343,THE WINTER'S TALE,"is innocent, Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true subject, Leontes a"
1344,THE WINTER'S TALE,"jealous tyrant, and the king shall live without an heir if that which"
1345,THE WINTER'S TALE,"is lost be not found_."" The king would give no credit to the words"
1346,THE WINTER'S TALE,of the oracle: he said it was a falsehood invented by the queen's
1347,THE WINTER'S TALE,"friends, and he desired the judge to proceed in the trial of the"
1348,THE WINTER'S TALE,"queen; but while Leontes was speaking, a man entered and told him that"
1349,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the prince Mamillus, hearing his mother was to be tried for her life,"
1350,THE WINTER'S TALE,"struck with grief and shame, had suddenly died."
1351,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1352,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Hermione, upon hearing of the death of this dear affectionate child,"
1353,THE WINTER'S TALE,"who had lost his life in sorrowing for her misfortune, fainted; and"
1354,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Leontes, pierced to the heart by the news, began to feel pity for his"
1355,THE WINTER'S TALE,"unhappy queen, and he ordered Paulina, and the ladies who were her"
1356,THE WINTER'S TALE,"attendants, to take her away, and use means for her recovery. Paulina"
1357,THE WINTER'S TALE,"soon returned, and told the king that Hermione was dead."
1358,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1359,THE WINTER'S TALE,"When Leontes heard that the queen was dead, he repented of his cruelty"
1360,THE WINTER'S TALE,to her; and now that he thought his ill usage had broken Hermione's
1361,THE WINTER'S TALE,"heart, he believed her innocent; and he now thought the words of the"
1362,THE WINTER'S TALE,"oracle were true, as he knew ""if that which was lost was not found,"""
1363,THE WINTER'S TALE,"which he concluded was his young daughter, he should be without an"
1364,THE WINTER'S TALE,"heir, the young prince Mamillus being dead; and he would give his"
1365,THE WINTER'S TALE,kingdom now to recover his lost daughter: and Leontes gave himself up
1366,THE WINTER'S TALE,"to remorse, and passed many years in mournful thoughts and repentant"
1367,THE WINTER'S TALE,grief.
1368,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1369,THE WINTER'S TALE,The ship in which Antigonus carried the infant princess out to sea
1370,THE WINTER'S TALE,"was driven by a storm upon the coast of Bohemia, the very kingdom of"
1371,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the good king Polixenes. Here Antigonus landed, and here he left the"
1372,THE WINTER'S TALE,little baby.
1373,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1374,THE WINTER'S TALE,Antigonus never returned to Sicily to tell Leontes where he had left
1375,THE WINTER'S TALE,"his daughter, for as he was going back to the ship, a bear came out"
1376,THE WINTER'S TALE,"of the woods, and tore him to pieces; a just punishment on him for"
1377,THE WINTER'S TALE,obeying the wicked order of Leontes.
1378,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1379,THE WINTER'S TALE,The child was dressed in rich clothes and jewels; for Hermione had
1380,THE WINTER'S TALE,"made it very fine when she sent it to Leontes, and Antigonus had"
1381,THE WINTER'S TALE,"pinned a paper to its mantle, with the name of _Perdita_ written"
1382,THE WINTER'S TALE,"thereon, and words obscurely intimating its high birth and untoward"
1383,THE WINTER'S TALE,fate.
1384,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1385,THE WINTER'S TALE,"This poor deserted baby was found by a shepherd. He was a humane man,"
1386,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and so he carried the little Perdita home to his wife, who nursed it"
1387,THE WINTER'S TALE,tenderly: but poverty tempted the shepherd to conceal the rich prize
1388,THE WINTER'S TALE,"he had found; therefore he left that part of the country, that no one"
1389,THE WINTER'S TALE,"might know where he got his riches, and with part of Perdita's jewels"
1390,THE WINTER'S TALE,"he bought herds of sheep, and became a wealthy shepherd. He brought up"
1391,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Perdita as his own child, and she knew not she was any other than a"
1392,THE WINTER'S TALE,shepherd's daughter.
1393,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1394,THE WINTER'S TALE,The little Perdita grew up a lovely maiden; and though she had no
1395,THE WINTER'S TALE,"better education than that of a shepherd's daughter, yet so did the"
1396,THE WINTER'S TALE,natural graces she inherited from her royal mother shine forth in her
1397,THE WINTER'S TALE,"untutored mind, that no one from her behaviour would have known she"
1398,THE WINTER'S TALE,had not been brought up in her father's court.
1399,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1400,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Polixenes, the king of Bohemia, had an only son, whose name was"
1401,THE WINTER'S TALE,Florizel. As this young prince was hunting near the shepherd's
1402,THE WINTER'S TALE,"dwelling, he saw the old man's supposed daughter; and the beauty,"
1403,THE WINTER'S TALE,"modesty, and queen-like deportment of Perdita caused him instantly to"
1404,THE WINTER'S TALE,"fall in love with her. He soon, under the name of Doricles, and in the"
1405,THE WINTER'S TALE,"disguise of a private gentleman, became a constant visitor at the old"
1406,THE WINTER'S TALE,shepherd's house.
1407,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1408,THE WINTER'S TALE,Florizel's frequent absences from court alarmed Polixenes; and setting
1409,THE WINTER'S TALE,"people to watch his son, he discovered his love for the shepherd's"
1410,THE WINTER'S TALE,fair daughter.
1411,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1412,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Polixenes then called for Camillo, the faithful Camillo, who had"
1413,THE WINTER'S TALE,preserved his life from the fury of Leontes; and desired that he would
1414,THE WINTER'S TALE,"accompany him to the house of the shepherd, the supposed father of"
1415,THE WINTER'S TALE,Perdita.
1416,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1417,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Polixenes and Camillo, both in disguise, arrived at the old shepherd's"
1418,THE WINTER'S TALE,dwelling while they were celebrating the feast of sheep-shearing; and
1419,THE WINTER'S TALE,"though they were strangers, yet at the sheep-shearing every guest"
1420,THE WINTER'S TALE,"being made welcome, they were invited to walk in, and join in the"
1421,THE WINTER'S TALE,general festivity.
1422,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1423,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Nothing but mirth and jolity was going forward. Tables were spread,"
1424,THE WINTER'S TALE,and great preparations were making for the rustic feast. Some lads and
1425,THE WINTER'S TALE,"lasses were dancing on the green before the house, while others of the"
1426,THE WINTER'S TALE,"young men were buying ribbands, gloves, and such toys, of a pedlar at"
1427,THE WINTER'S TALE,the door.
1428,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1429,THE WINTER'S TALE,"While this busy scene was going forward, Florizel and Perdita"
1430,THE WINTER'S TALE,"sat quietly in a retired corner, seemingly more pleased with the"
1431,THE WINTER'S TALE,"conversation of each other, than desirous of engaging in the sports"
1432,THE WINTER'S TALE,and silly amusements of those around them.
1433,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1434,THE WINTER'S TALE,The king was so disguised that it was impossible his son could know
1435,THE WINTER'S TALE,him; he therefore advanced near enough to hear the conversation. The
1436,THE WINTER'S TALE,simple yet elegant manner in which Perdita conversed with his son did
1437,THE WINTER'S TALE,"not a little surprise Polixenes: he said to Camillo, ""This is the"
1438,THE WINTER'S TALE,prettiest low-born lass I ever saw; nothing she does or says but looks
1439,THE WINTER'S TALE,"like something greater than herself, too noble for this place."""
1440,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1441,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Camillo replied, ""Indeed she is the very queen of curds and cream."""
1442,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1443,THE WINTER'S TALE,"""Pray, my good friend,"" said the king to the old shepherd, ""what fair"
1444,THE WINTER'S TALE,"swain is that talking with your daughter?"" ""They call him Doricles,"""
1445,THE WINTER'S TALE,"replied the shepherd. ""He says he loves my daughter; and to speak"
1446,THE WINTER'S TALE,"truth, there is not a kiss to choose which loves the other best. If"
1447,THE WINTER'S TALE,"young Doricles can get her, she shall bring him that he little dreams"
1448,THE WINTER'S TALE,"of:"" meaning the remainder of Perdita's jewels; which, after he had"
1449,THE WINTER'S TALE,"bought herds of sheep with part of them, he had carefully hoarded up"
1450,THE WINTER'S TALE,for her marriage-portion.
1451,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1452,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Polixenes then addressed his son. ""How now, young man!"" said he: ""your"
1453,THE WINTER'S TALE,heart seems full of something that takes off your mind from feasting.
1454,THE WINTER'S TALE,"When I was young, I used to load my love with presents; but you have"
1455,THE WINTER'S TALE,"let the pedlar go, and have bought your lass no toy."""
1456,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1457,THE WINTER'S TALE,"The young prince, who little thought he was talking to the king his"
1458,THE WINTER'S TALE,"father, replied, ""Old sir, she prizes not such trifles; the gifts"
1459,THE WINTER'S TALE,"which Perdita expects from me are locked up in my heart."" Then turning"
1460,THE WINTER'S TALE,"to Perdita, he said to her, ""O hear me, Perdita, before this ancient"
1461,THE WINTER'S TALE,"gentleman, who it seems was once himself a lover; he shall hear what I"
1462,THE WINTER'S TALE,"profess."" Florizel then called upon the old stranger to be a witness"
1463,THE WINTER'S TALE,"to a solemn promise of marriage which he made to Perdita, saying to"
1464,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Polixenes, ""I pray you, mark our contract."""
1465,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1466,THE WINTER'S TALE,"""Mark your divorce, young sir,"" said the king, discovering himself."
1467,THE WINTER'S TALE,Polixenes then reproached his son for daring to contract himself to
1468,THE WINTER'S TALE,"this low-born maiden, calling Perdita ""shepherd's-brat, sheep-hook,"""
1469,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and other disrespectful names; and threatening, if ever she suffered"
1470,THE WINTER'S TALE,"his son to see her again, he would put her, and the old shepherd her"
1471,THE WINTER'S TALE,"father, to a cruel death."
1472,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1473,THE WINTER'S TALE,"The king then left them in great wrath, and ordered Camillo to follow"
1474,THE WINTER'S TALE,him with prince Florizel.
1475,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1476,THE WINTER'S TALE,"When the king had departed, Perdita, whose royal nature was roused by"
1477,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Polixenes's reproaches, said, ""Though we are all undone, I was not"
1478,THE WINTER'S TALE,"much afraid; and once or twice I was about to speak, and tell him"
1479,THE WINTER'S TALE,"plainly that the self-same sun which shines upon his palace, hides not"
1480,THE WINTER'S TALE,"his face from our cottage, but looks on both alike."" Then sorrowfully"
1481,THE WINTER'S TALE,"she said, ""But now I am awakened from this dream, I will queen it no"
1482,THE WINTER'S TALE,"farther. Leave me, sir; I will go milk my ewes, and weep."""
1483,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1484,THE WINTER'S TALE,The kind-hearted Camillo was charmed with the spirit and propriety
1485,THE WINTER'S TALE,of Perdita's behaviour; and perceiving that the young prince was too
1486,THE WINTER'S TALE,deeply in love to give up his mistress at the command of his royal
1487,THE WINTER'S TALE,"father, he thought of a way to befriend the lovers, and at the same"
1488,THE WINTER'S TALE,time to execute a favourite scheme he had in his mind.
1489,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1490,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Camillo had long known that Leontes, the king of Sicily, was become"
1491,THE WINTER'S TALE,a true penitent; and though Camillo was now the favoured friend of
1492,THE WINTER'S TALE,"king Polixenes, he could not help wishing once more to see his late"
1493,THE WINTER'S TALE,royal master and his native home. He therefore proposed to Florizel
1494,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and Perdita, that they should accompany him to the Sicilian court,"
1495,THE WINTER'S TALE,"where he would engage Leontes should protect them, till through his"
1496,THE WINTER'S TALE,"mediation they could obtain pardon from Polixenes, and his consent to"
1497,THE WINTER'S TALE,their marriage.
1498,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1499,THE WINTER'S TALE,"To this proposal they joyfully agreed; and Camillo, who conducted"
1500,THE WINTER'S TALE,"every thing relative to their flight, allowed the old shepherd to go"
1501,THE WINTER'S TALE,along with them.
1502,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1503,THE WINTER'S TALE,"The shepherd took with him the remainder of Perdita's jewels, her baby"
1504,THE WINTER'S TALE,"clothes, and the paper which he had found pinned to her mantle."
1505,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1506,THE WINTER'S TALE,"After a prosperous voyage, Florizel and Perdita, Camillo and the old"
1507,THE WINTER'S TALE,"shepherd, arrived in safety at the court of Leontes. Leontes, who"
1508,THE WINTER'S TALE,"still mourned his dead Hermione and his lost child, received Camillo"
1509,THE WINTER'S TALE,"with great kindness, and gave a cordial welcome to prince Florizel."
1510,THE WINTER'S TALE,"But Perdita, whom Florizel introduced as his princess, seemed to"
1511,THE WINTER'S TALE,engross all Leontes' attention: perceiving a resemblance between her
1512,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and his dead queen Hermione, his grief broke out afresh, and he said,"
1513,THE WINTER'S TALE,"such a lovely creature might his own daughter have been, if he had not"
1514,THE WINTER'S TALE,"so cruelly destroyed her. ""And then too,"" said he to Florizel, ""I lost"
1515,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the society and friendship of your brave father, whom I now desire"
1516,THE WINTER'S TALE,"more than my life once again to look upon."""
1517,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1518,THE WINTER'S TALE,When the old shepherd heard how much notice the king had taken of
1519,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Perdita, and that he had lost a daughter, who was exposed in infancy,"
1520,THE WINTER'S TALE,he fell to comparing the time when he found the little Perdita with
1521,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the manner of its exposure, the jewels and other tokens of its high"
1522,THE WINTER'S TALE,"birth; from all which it was impossible for him not to conclude, that"
1523,THE WINTER'S TALE,Perdita and the king's lost daughter were the same.
1524,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1525,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Florizel and Perdita, Camillo and the faithful Paulina, were present"
1526,THE WINTER'S TALE,when the old shepherd related to the king the manner in which he had
1527,THE WINTER'S TALE,"found the child, and also the circumstance of Antigonus's death,"
1528,THE WINTER'S TALE,he having seen the bear seize upon him. He shewed the rich mantle
1529,THE WINTER'S TALE,in which Paulina remembered Hermione had wrapped the child; and
1530,THE WINTER'S TALE,he produced a jewel which she remembered Hermione had tied about
1531,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Perdita's neck, and he gave up the paper which Paulina knew to be"
1532,THE WINTER'S TALE,the writing of her husband; it could not be doubted that Perdita was
1533,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Leontes' own daughter: but oh! the noble struggles of Paulina, between"
1534,THE WINTER'S TALE,"sorrow for her husband's death, and joy that the oracle was fulfilled,"
1535,THE WINTER'S TALE,"in the king's heir, his long-lost daughter, being found. When Leontes"
1536,THE WINTER'S TALE,"heard that Perdita was his daughter, the great sorrow that he felt"
1537,THE WINTER'S TALE,"that Hermione was not living to behold her child, made him that he"
1538,THE WINTER'S TALE,"could say nothing for a long time, but ""O thy mother, thy mother!"""
1539,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1540,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Paulina interrupted this joyful yet distressful scene, with saying to"
1541,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Leontes, that she had a statue, newly finished by that rare Italian"
1542,THE WINTER'S TALE,"master, Julio Romano, which was such a perfect resemblance of the"
1543,THE WINTER'S TALE,"queen, that would his majesty be pleased to go to her house and look"
1544,THE WINTER'S TALE,"upon it, he would be almost ready to think it was Hermione herself."
1545,THE WINTER'S TALE,Thither then they all went; the king anxious to see the semblance of
1546,THE WINTER'S TALE,"his Hermione, and Perdita longing to behold what the mother she never"
1547,THE WINTER'S TALE,saw did look like.
1548,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1549,THE WINTER'S TALE,"When Paulina drew back the curtain which concealed this famous statue,"
1550,THE WINTER'S TALE,"so perfectly did it resemble Hermione, that all the king's sorrow was"
1551,THE WINTER'S TALE,renewed at the sight: for a long time he had no power to speak or
1552,THE WINTER'S TALE,move.
1553,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1554,THE WINTER'S TALE,"""I like your silence, my liege,"" said Paulina; ""it the more shews your"
1555,THE WINTER'S TALE,"wonder. Is not this statue very like your queen?"" At length the king"
1556,THE WINTER'S TALE,"said, ""O, thus she stood, even with such majesty, when I first wooed"
1557,THE WINTER'S TALE,"her. But yet, Paulina, Hermione was not so aged as this statue looks."""
1558,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Paulina replied, ""So much the more the carver's excellence, who has"
1559,THE WINTER'S TALE,made the statue as Hermione would have looked had she been living now.
1560,THE WINTER'S TALE,"But let me draw the curtain, sire, lest presently you think it moves."""
1561,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1562,THE WINTER'S TALE,"The king then said, ""Do not draw the curtain! Would I were dead! See,"
1563,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Camillo, would you not think it breathed? Her eye seems to have motion"
1564,THE WINTER'S TALE,"in it."" ""I must draw the curtain, my liege,"" said Paulina. ""You are so"
1565,THE WINTER'S TALE,"transported, you will persuade yourself the statue lives."" ""O, sweet"
1566,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Paulina,"" said Leontes, ""make me think so twenty years together! Still"
1567,THE WINTER'S TALE,methinks there is an air comes from her. What fine chisel could ever
1568,THE WINTER'S TALE,"yet cut breath? Let no man mock me, for I will kiss her."" ""Good, my"
1569,THE WINTER'S TALE,"lord, forbear!"" said Paulina. ""The ruddiness upon her lip is wet; you"
1570,THE WINTER'S TALE,"will stain your own with oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?"""
1571,THE WINTER'S TALE,"""No, not these twenty years,"" said Leontes."
1572,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1573,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Perdita, who all this time had been kneeling, and beholding in silent"
1574,THE WINTER'S TALE,"admiration the statue of her matchless mother, said now, ""And so long"
1575,THE WINTER'S TALE,"could I stay here, looking upon my dear mother."""
1576,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1577,THE WINTER'S TALE,"""Either forbear this transport,"" said Paulina to Leontes, ""and let me"
1578,THE WINTER'S TALE,draw the curtain; or prepare yourself for more amazement. I can make
1579,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the statue move indeed; aye, and descend from off the pedestal, and"
1580,THE WINTER'S TALE,"take you by the hand. But then you will think, which I protest I am"
1581,THE WINTER'S TALE,"not, that I am assisted by some wicked powers."" ""What you can make her"
1582,THE WINTER'S TALE,"do,"" said the astonished king, ""I am content to look upon. What you"
1583,THE WINTER'S TALE,"can make her speak, I am content to hear; for it is as easy to make"
1584,THE WINTER'S TALE,"her speak as move."""
1585,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1586,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Paulina then ordered some slow and solemn music, which she had"
1587,THE WINTER'S TALE,"prepared for the purpose, to strike up; and to the amazement of all"
1588,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the beholders, the statue came down from off the pedestal, and threw"
1589,THE WINTER'S TALE,"its arms around Leontes' neck. The statue then began to speak, praying"
1590,THE WINTER'S TALE,"for blessings on her husband, and on her child, the newly found"
1591,THE WINTER'S TALE,Perdita.
1592,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1593,THE WINTER'S TALE,"No wonder that the statue hung upon Leontes' neck, and blessed her"
1594,THE WINTER'S TALE,husband and her child. No wonder; for the statue was indeed Hermione
1595,THE WINTER'S TALE,"herself, the real, the living queen."
1596,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1597,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Paulina had falsely reported to the king the death of Hermione,"
1598,THE WINTER'S TALE,thinking that the only means to preserve her royal mistress's life;
1599,THE WINTER'S TALE,"and with the good Paulina Hermione had lived ever since, never"
1600,THE WINTER'S TALE,"choosing Leontes should know she was living, till she heard Perdita"
1601,THE WINTER'S TALE,was found; for though she had long forgiven the injuries which Leontes
1602,THE WINTER'S TALE,"had done to herself, she could not pardon his cruelty to his infant"
1603,THE WINTER'S TALE,daughter.
1604,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1605,THE WINTER'S TALE,"His dead queen thus restored to life, his lost daughter found, the"
1606,THE WINTER'S TALE,long-sorrowing Leontes could scarcely support the excess of his own
1607,THE WINTER'S TALE,happiness.
1608,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1609,THE WINTER'S TALE,Nothing but congratulations and affectionate speeches were heard on
1610,THE WINTER'S TALE,all sides. Now the delighted parents thanked prince Florizel for
1611,THE WINTER'S TALE,loving their lowly-seeming daughter; and now they blessed the good old
1612,THE WINTER'S TALE,shepherd for preserving their child. Greatly did Camillo and Paulina
1613,THE WINTER'S TALE,"rejoice, that they had lived to see so good an end of all their"
1614,THE WINTER'S TALE,faithful services.
1615,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1616,THE WINTER'S TALE,And as if nothing should be wanting to complete this strange and
1617,THE WINTER'S TALE,"unlooked-for joy, king Polixenes himself now entered the palace."
1618,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1619,THE WINTER'S TALE,"When Polixenes first missed his son and Camillo, knowing that Camillo"
1620,THE WINTER'S TALE,"had long wished to return to Sicily, he conjectured he should find"
1621,THE WINTER'S TALE,"the fugitives here; and, following them with all speed, he happened"
1622,THE WINTER'S TALE,"to arrive just at this, the happiest moment of Leontes' life."
1623,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1624,THE WINTER'S TALE,Polixenes took a part in the general joy; he forgave his friend
1625,THE WINTER'S TALE,"Leontes the unjust jealousy he had conceived against him, and they"
1626,THE WINTER'S TALE,once more loved each other with all the warmth of their first boyish
1627,THE WINTER'S TALE,friendship. And there was no fear that Polixenes would now oppose
1628,THE WINTER'S TALE,"his son's marriage with Perdita. She was no ""sheep-hook"" now, but"
1629,THE WINTER'S TALE,the heiress of the crown of Sicily.
1630,THE WINTER'S TALE,
1631,THE WINTER'S TALE,Thus have we seen the patient virtues of the long-suffering Hermione
1632,THE WINTER'S TALE,rewarded. That excellent lady lived many years with her Leontes and
1633,THE WINTER'S TALE,"her Perdita, the happiest of mothers and of queens."

1639,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1640,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,(_By Mary Lamb_)
1641,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1642,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1643,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"There lived in the palace at Messina two ladies, whose names were"
1644,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Hero and Beatrice. Hero was the daughter, and Beatrice the niece, of"
1645,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Leonato, the governor of Messina."
1646,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1647,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Beatrice was of a lively temper, and loved to divert her cousin Hero,"
1648,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"who was of a more serious disposition, with her sprightly sallies."
1649,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,Whatever was going forward was sure to make matter of mirth for the
1650,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,light-hearted Beatrice.
1651,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1652,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"At the time the history of these ladies commences, some young men of"
1653,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"high rank in the army, as they were passing through Messina on their"
1654,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"return from a war that was just ended, in which they had distinguished"
1655,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"themselves by their great bravery, came to visit Leonato. Among these"
1656,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"were Don Pedro, the prince of Arragon; and his friend Claudio, who was"
1657,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"a lord of Florence; and with them came the wild and witty Benedick,"
1658,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,and he was a lord of Padua.
1659,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1660,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"These strangers had been at Messina before, and the hospitable"
1661,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,governor introduced them to his daughter and his niece as their old
1662,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,friends and acquaintance.
1663,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1664,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Benedick, the moment he entered the room, began a lively conversation"
1665,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"with Leonato and the prince. Beatrice, who liked not to be left out of"
1666,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"any discourse, interrupted Benedick with saying, ""I wonder that you"
1667,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"will still be talking, signior Benedick; nobody marks you."" Benedick"
1668,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"was just such another rattle-brain as Beatrice, yet he was not pleased"
1669,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,at this free salutation: he thought it did not become a well-bred lady
1670,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"to be so flippant with her tongue; and he remembered, when he was last"
1671,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"at Messina, that Beatrice used to select him to make her merry jests"
1672,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,upon. And as there is no one who so little likes to be made a jest of
1673,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"as those who are apt to take the same liberty themselves, so it was"
1674,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,with Benedick and Beatrice; these two sharp wits never met in former
1675,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"times but a perfect war of raillery was kept up between them, and they"
1676,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,always parted mutually displeased with each other. Therefore when
1677,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,Beatrice stopped him in the middle of his discourse with telling him
1678,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"nobody marked what he was saying, Benedick, affecting not to have"
1679,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"observed before that she was present, said, ""What, my dear lady"
1680,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Disdain, are you yet living?"" And now war broke out afresh between"
1681,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"them, and a long jangling argument ensued, during which Beatrice,"
1682,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"although she knew he had so well approved his valour in the late war,"
1683,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,said that she would eat all he had killed there: and observing the
1684,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"prince take delight in Benedick's conversation, she called him ""the"
1685,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"prince's jester."" This sarcasm sunk deeper into the mind of Benedick"
1686,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,than all Beatrice had said before. The hint she gave him that he was a
1687,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"coward, by saying she would eat all he had killed, he did not regard,"
1688,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,knowing himself to be a brave man: but there is nothing that great
1689,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"wits so much dread as the imputation of buffoonery, because the charge"
1690,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,comes sometimes a little too near the truth; therefore Benedick
1691,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"perfectly hated Beatrice, when she called him ""the prince's jester."""
1692,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1693,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,The modest lady Hero was silent before the noble guests; and while
1694,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,Claudio was attentively observing the improvement which time had made
1695,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"in her beauty, and was contemplating the exquisite graces of her fine"
1696,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"figure (for she was an admirable young lady), the prince was highly"
1697,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,amused with listening to the humorous dialogue between Benedick
1698,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"and Beatrice; and he said in a whisper to Leonato, ""This is a"
1699,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,pleasant-spirited young lady. She were an excellent wife for
1700,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Benedick."" Leonato replied to this suggestion, ""O my lord, my lord,"
1701,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad."" But"
1702,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"though Leonato thought they would make a discordant pair, the prince"
1703,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,did not give up the idea of matching these two keen wits together.
1704,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1705,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"When the prince returned with Claudio from the palace, he found that"
1706,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,the marriage he had devised between Benedick and Beatrice was not the
1707,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"only one projected in that good company, for Claudio spoke in such"
1708,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"terms of Hero, as made the prince guess at what was passing in his"
1709,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"heart; and he liked it well, and he said to Claudio, ""Do you affect"
1710,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Hero?"" To this question Claudio replied, ""O my lord, when I was last"
1711,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"at Messina, I looked upon her with a soldier's eye, that liked, but"
1712,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"had no leisure for loving; but now, in this happy time of peace,"
1713,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"thoughts of war have left their places vacant in my mind, and in their"
1714,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"room come thronging soft and delicate thoughts, all prompting me how"
1715,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"fair young Hero is, reminding me that I liked her before I went to the"
1716,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"wars."" Claudio's confession of his love for Hero so wrought upon the"
1717,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"prince, that he lost no time in soliciting the consent of Leonato to"
1718,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"accept of Claudio for a son-in-law. Leonato agreed to this proposal,"
1719,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,and the prince found no great difficulty in persuading the gentle Hero
1720,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"herself to listen to the suit of the noble Claudio, who was a lord of"
1721,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"rare endowments, and highly accomplished; and Claudio, assisted by his"
1722,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"kind prince, soon prevailed upon Leonato to fix an early day for the"
1723,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,celebration of his marriage with Hero.
1724,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1725,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,Claudio was to wait but a few days before he was to be married to
1726,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"his fair lady; yet he complained of the interval being tedious, as"
1727,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"indeed most young men are impatient, when they are waiting for the"
1728,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,accomplishment of any event they have set their hearts upon: the
1729,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"prince therefore, to make the time seem short to him, proposed as a"
1730,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"kind of merry pastime, that they should invent some artful scheme"
1731,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,to make Benedick and Beatrice fall in love with each other. Claudio
1732,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"entered with great satisfaction into this whim of the prince, and"
1733,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Leonato promised them his assistance, and even Hero said she would do"
1734,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,any modest office to help her cousin to a good husband.
1735,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1736,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"The device the prince invented was, that the gentlemen should make"
1737,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Benedick believe that Beatrice was in love with him, and that Hero"
1738,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,should make Beatrice believe that Benedick was in love with her.
1739,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1740,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"The prince, Leonato, and Claudio, began their operations first, and"
1741,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,watching an opportunity when Benedick was quietly seated reading in
1742,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"an arbour, the prince and his assistants took their station among the"
1743,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"trees behind the arbour, so near that Benedick could not choose but"
1744,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"hear all they said; and after some careless talk the prince said,"
1745,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"""Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me the other day,--that"
1746,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,your niece Beatrice was in love with signior Benedick? I did never
1747,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"think that lady would have loved any man."" ""No, nor I neither, my"
1748,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"lord,"" answered Leonato. ""It is most wonderful that she should so"
1749,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"doat on Benedick, whom she in all outward behaviour seemed ever to"
1750,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"dislike."" Claudio confirmed all this, with saying that Hero had told"
1751,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,him Beatrice was so in love with Benedick that she would certainly die
1752,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"of grief, if he could not be brought to love her; which Leonato and"
1753,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Claudio seemed to agree was impossible, he having always been such a"
1754,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"railer against all fair ladies, and in particular against Beatrice."
1755,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1756,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,The prince affected to hearken to all this with great compassion for
1757,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Beatrice, and he said, ""It were good that Benedick were told of this."""
1758,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"""To what end?"" said Claudio; ""he would but make sport of it, and"
1759,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"torment the poor lady worse."" ""And if he should,"" said the prince, ""it"
1760,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"were a good deed to hang him; for Beatrice is an excellent sweet lady,"
1761,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"and exceeding wise in every thing but in loving Benedick."" Then the"
1762,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"prince motioned to his companions that they should walk on, and leave"
1763,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,Benedick to meditate upon what he had overheard.
1764,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1765,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,Benedick had been listening with great eagerness to this conversation;
1766,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"and he said to himself when he heard Beatrice loved him, ""Is it"
1767,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"possible? Sits the wind in that corner?"" And when they were gone, he"
1768,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"began to reason in this manner with himself. ""This can be no trick!"
1769,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"they were very serious, and they have the truth from Hero, and seem to"
1770,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"pity the lady. Love me! Why, it must be requited! I did never think"
1771,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"to marry. But when I said I should die a bachelor, I did not think I"
1772,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,should live to be married. They say the lady is virtuous and fair. She
1773,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,is so. And wise in every thing but in loving me. Why that is no great
1774,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"argument of her folly. But here comes Beatrice. By this day, she"
1775,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"is a fair lady. I do spy some marks of love in her."" Beatrice now"
1776,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"approached him, and said with her usual tartness, ""Against my will"
1777,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"I am sent to bid you come in to dinner."" Benedick, who never felt"
1778,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"himself disposed to speak so politely to her before, replied, ""Fair"
1779,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Beatrice, I thank you for your pains:"" and when Beatrice after two"
1780,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"or three more rude speeches left him, Benedick thought he observed a"
1781,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"concealed meaning of kindness under the uncivil words she uttered, and"
1782,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"he said aloud, ""If I do not take pity on her, I am a villain. If I do"
1783,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture."""
1784,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1785,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"The gentleman being thus caught in the net they had spread for him,"
1786,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,it was now Hero's turn to play her part with Beatrice; and for
1787,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"this purpose she sent for Ursula and Margaret, two gentlewomen who"
1788,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"attended upon her, and she said to Margaret, ""Good Margaret, run to"
1789,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,the parlour; there you will find my cousin Beatrice talking with the
1790,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"prince and Claudio. Whisper in her ear, that I and Ursula are walking"
1791,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"in the orchard, and that our discourse is all of her. Bid her steal"
1792,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"into that pleasant arbour, where honey-suckles, ripened by the sun,"
1793,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"like ungrateful minions, forbid the sun to enter."" This arbour,"
1794,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"into which Hero desired Margaret to entice Beatrice, was the very"
1795,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,same pleasant arbour where Benedick had so lately been an attentive
1796,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"listener. ""I will make her come, I warrant, presently,"" said Margaret."
1797,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1798,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Hero, then taking Ursula with her into the orchard, said to her, ""Now,"
1799,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Ursula, when Beatrice comes, we will walk up and down this alley, and"
1800,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"our talk must be only of Benedick, and when I name him, let it be"
1801,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,your part to praise him more than ever man did merit. My talk to you
1802,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,must be how Benedick is in love with Beatrice. Now begin; for look
1803,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"where Beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground, to hear"
1804,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"our conference."" They then began; Hero saying, as if in answer to"
1805,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"something which Ursula had said, ""No truly, Ursula. She is too"
1806,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"disdainful; her spirits are as coy as wild birds of the rock."""
1807,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"""But are you sure,"" said Ursula, ""that Benedick loves Beatrice so"
1808,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"entirely?"" Hero replied, ""So says the prince, and my lord Claudio, and"
1809,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"they intreated me to acquaint her with it; but I persuaded them, if"
1810,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"they loved Benedick, never to let Beatrice know of it."" ""Certainly,"""
1811,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"replied Ursula, ""it were not good she knew his love, lest she made"
1812,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"sport of it."" ""Why to say truth,"" said Hero, ""I never yet saw a man,"
1813,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"how wise soever, or noble, young or rarely featured, but she would"
1814,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"dispraise him."" ""Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable,"" said"
1815,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Ursula. ""No,"" replied Hero, ""but who dare tell her so? if I should"
1816,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"speak, she would mock me into air."" ""O you wrong your cousin,"" said"
1817,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Ursula: ""she cannot be so much without true judgment, as to refuse"
1818,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"so rare a gentleman as signior Benedick."" ""He hath an excellent"
1819,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"good name,"" said Hero: ""indeed he is the first man in Italy, always"
1820,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"excepting my dear Claudio."" And now, Hero giving her attendant a hint"
1821,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"that it was time to change the discourse, Ursula said, ""And when are"
1822,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"you to be married, madam?"" Hero then told her, that she was to be"
1823,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"married to Claudio the next day, and desired she would go in with her,"
1824,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"and look at some new attire, as she wished to consult with her on what"
1825,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"she should wear on the morrow. Beatrice, who had been listening with"
1826,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"breathless eagerness to this dialogue, when they went away, exclaimed,"
1827,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"""What fire is in my ears? Can this be true? Farewel, contempt, and"
1828,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"scorn and maiden pride, adieu! Benedick, love on! I will requite you,"
1829,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"taming my wild heart to your loving hand."""
1830,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1831,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,It must have been a pleasant sight to see these old enemies converted
1832,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,into new and loving friends; and to behold their first meeting
1833,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,after being cheated into mutual liking by the merry artifice of the
1834,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,good-humoured prince. But a sad reverse in the fortunes of Hero must
1835,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"now be thought of. The morrow, which was to have been her wedding day,"
1836,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,brought sorrow on the heart of Hero and her good father Leonato.
1837,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1838,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"The prince had a half-brother, who came from the wars along with him"
1839,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"to Messina. This brother (his name was Don John) was a melancholy,"
1840,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"discontented man, whose spirits seemed to labour in the contriving"
1841,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"of villanies. He hated the prince his brother, and he hated Claudio,"
1842,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"because he was the prince's friend, and determined to prevent"
1843,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Claudio's marriage with Hero, only for the malicious pleasure of"
1844,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,making Claudio and the prince unhappy: for he knew the prince had set
1845,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"his heart upon this marriage, almost as much as Claudio himself: and"
1846,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"to effect this wicked purpose, he employed one Borachio, a man as bad"
1847,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"as himself, whom he encouraged with the offer of a great reward. This"
1848,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Borachio paid his court to Margaret, Hero's attendant; and Don John,"
1849,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"knowing this, prevailed upon him to make Margaret promise to talk with"
1850,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"him from her lady's chamber-window that night, after Hero was asleep,"
1851,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"and also to dress herself in Hero's clothes, the better to deceive"
1852,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,Claudio into the belief that it was Hero; for that was the end he
1853,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,meant to compass by this wicked plot.
1854,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1855,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Don John then went to the prince and Claudio, and told them that"
1856,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Hero was an imprudent lady, and that she talked with men from her"
1857,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,chamber-window at midnight. Now this was the evening before the
1858,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"wedding, and he offered to take them that night, where they should"
1859,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,themselves hear Hero discoursing with a man from her window; and they
1860,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"consented to go along with him, and Claudio said, ""If I see any thing"
1861,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"to-night why I should not marry her, to-morrow in the congregation,"
1862,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"where I intended to wed her, there will I shame her."" The prince also"
1863,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"said, ""And as I assisted you to obtain her, I will join with you to"
1864,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"disgrace her."""
1865,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1866,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"When Don John brought them near Hero's chamber that night, they saw"
1867,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Borachio standing under the window, and they saw Margaret looking out"
1868,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"of Hero's window, and heard her talking with Borachio; and Margaret"
1869,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"being dressed in the same clothes they had seen Hero wear, the prince"
1870,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,and Claudio believed it was the lady Hero herself.
1871,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1872,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Nothing could equal the anger of Claudio, when he had made (as he"
1873,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,thought) this discovery. All his love for the innocent Hero was at
1874,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"once converted into hatred, and he resolved to expose her in the"
1875,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"church, as he had said he would, the next day; and the prince agreed"
1876,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"to this, thinking no punishment could be too severe for the naughty"
1877,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"lady, who talked with a man from her window the very night before she"
1878,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,was going to be married to the noble Claudio.
1879,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1880,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"The next day, when they were all met to celebrate the marriage,"
1881,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"and Claudio and Hero were standing before the priest, and the"
1882,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"priest, or friar as he was called, was proceeding to pronounce"
1883,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"the marriage-ceremony, Claudio, in the most passionate language,"
1884,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"proclaimed the guilt of the blameless Hero, who, amazed at the strange"
1885,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"words he uttered, said meekly, ""Is my lord well, that he does speak"
1886,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"so wide?"""
1887,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1888,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Leonato, in the utmost horror, said to the prince, ""My lord, why"
1889,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"speak not you?"" ""What should I speak?"" said the prince; ""I stand"
1890,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"dishonoured, that have gone about to link my dear friend to an"
1891,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"unworthy woman. Leonato, upon my honour, myself, my brother, and this"
1892,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"grieved Claudio, did see and hear her last night at midnight talk with"
1893,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"a man at her chamber-window."""
1894,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1895,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Benedick, in astonishment at what he heard, said, ""This looks not like"
1896,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"a nuptial."""
1897,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1898,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"""True, O God!"" replied the heart-struck Hero; and then this hapless"
1899,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"lady sunk down in a fainting fit, to all appearance dead. The prince"
1900,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"and Claudio left the church, without staying to see if Hero would"
1901,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"recover, or at all regarding the distress into which they had thrown"
1902,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,Leonato. So hard-hearted had their anger made them.
1903,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1904,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Benedick remained, and assisted Beatrice to recover Hero from her"
1905,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"swoon, saying, ""How does the lady?"" ""Dead, I think,"" replied Beatrice"
1906,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"in great agony, for she loved her cousin; and knowing her virtuous"
1907,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"principles, she believed nothing of what she had heard spoken against"
1908,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,her. Not so the poor old father; he believed the story of his child's
1909,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"shame, and it was piteous to hear him lamenting over her, as she lay"
1910,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"like one dead before him, wishing she might never more open her eyes."
1911,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1912,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"But the ancient friar was a wise man, and full of observation on human"
1913,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"nature, and he had attentively marked the lady's countenance when she"
1914,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"heard herself accused, and noted a thousand blushing shames to start"
1915,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"into her face, and then he saw an angel-like whiteness bear away"
1916,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"those blushes, and in her eye he saw a fire that did belie the error"
1917,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"that the prince did speak against her maiden truth, and he said to"
1918,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"the sorrowing father, ""Call me a fool; trust not my reading, nor my"
1919,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"observation; trust not my age, my reverence, nor my calling; if this"
1920,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error."""
1921,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1922,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"When Hero had recovered from the swoon into which she had fallen, the"
1923,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"friar said to her, ""Lady, what man is he you are accused of?"" Hero"
1924,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"replied, ""They know that do accuse me; I know of none:"" then turning"
1925,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"to Leonato, she said, ""O my father, if you can prove that any man has"
1926,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"ever conversed with me at hours unmeet, or that I yesternight changed"
1927,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"words with any creature, refuse me, hate me, torture me to death."""
1928,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1929,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"""There is,"" said the friar, ""some strange misunderstanding in the"
1930,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"prince and Claudio;"" and then he counselled Leonato, that he should"
1931,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"report that Hero was dead; and he said, that the death-like swoon in"
1932,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"which they had left Hero, would make this easy of belief; and he also"
1933,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"advised him, that he should put on mourning, and erect a monument for"
1934,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"her, and do all rites that appertain to a burial. ""What shall become"
1935,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"of this?"" said Leonato; ""What will this do?"" The friar replied, ""This"
1936,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"report of her death shall change slander into pity; that is some good,"
1937,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,but that is not all the good I hope for. When Claudio shall hear she
1938,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"died upon hearing his words, the idea of her life shall sweetly creep"
1939,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"into his imagination. Then shall he mourn, if ever love had interest"
1940,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"in his heart, and wish he had not so accused her: yea, though he"
1941,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"thought his accusation true."""
1942,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1943,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Benedick now said, ""Leonato, let the friar advise you; and though you"
1944,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"know how well I love the prince and Claudio, yet on my honour I will"
1945,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"not reveal this secret to them."""
1946,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1947,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Leonato, thus persuaded, yielded; and he said sorrowfully, ""I am so"
1948,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"grieved, that the smallest twine may lead me."" The kind friar then led"
1949,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Leonato and Hero away to comfort and console them, and Beatrice and"
1950,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,Benedick remained alone; and this was the meeting from which their
1951,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"friends, who contrived the merry plot against them, expected so much"
1952,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"diversion; those friends who were now overwhelmed with affliction, and"
1953,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,from whose minds all thoughts of merriment seemed for ever banished.
1954,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1955,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Benedick was the first who spoke, and he said, ""Lady Beatrice, have"
1956,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"you wept all this while?"" ""Yea, and I will weep a while longer,"" said"
1957,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Beatrice. ""Surely,"" said Benedick, ""I do believe your fair cousin is"
1958,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"wronged."" ""Ah!"" said Beatrice, ""how much might that man deserve of me"
1959,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"who would right her!"" Benedick then said, ""Is there any way to show"
1960,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,such friendship? I do love nothing in the world so well as you; is not
1961,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"that strange?"" ""It were as possible,"" said Beatrice, ""for me to say I"
1962,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"loved nothing in the world so well as you; but believe me not, and yet"

1965,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"love you. Come, bid me do any thing for you."" ""Kill Claudio,"" said"
1966,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Beatrice. ""Ha! not for the wide world,"" said Benedick: for he loved"
1967,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"his friend Claudio, and he believed he had been imposed upon. ""Is not"

1969,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"cousin?"" said Beatrice: ""O that I were a man!"" ""Hear me, Beatrice!"""
1970,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,said Benedick. But Beatrice would hear nothing in Claudio's defence;
1971,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,and she continued to urge on Benedick to revenge her cousin's wrongs:
1972,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"and she said, ""Talk with a man out of the window; a proper saying!"
1973,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,Sweet Hero! she is wronged; she is slandered; she is undone. O that
1974,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"I were a man for Claudio's sake! or that I had any friend, who would"
1975,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,be a man for my sake! but valour is melted into courtesies and
1976,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"compliments. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a"
1977,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"woman with grieving."" ""Tarry, good Beatrice,"" said Benedick: ""by this"
1978,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"hand, I love you."" ""Use it for my love some other way than swearing by"
1979,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"it,"" said Beatrice. ""Think you on your soul, that Claudio has wronged"
1980,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Hero?"" asked Benedick. ""Yea,"" answered Beatrice; ""as sure as I have a"
1981,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"thought, or a soul."" ""Enough,"" said Benedick; ""I am engaged; I will"
1982,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"challenge him. I will kiss your hand, and so leave you. By this hand,"
1983,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Claudio shall render me a dear account! As you hear from me, so think"

1985,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
1986,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"While Beatrice was thus powerfully pleading with Benedick, and working"

1991,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"But they respected his age and his sorrow, and they said, ""Nay, do not"

1993,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,challenged Claudio to answer with his sword the injury he had done to
1994,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Hero: and Claudio and the prince said to each other, ""Beatrice has"
1995,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"set him on to do this."" Claudio nevertheless must have accepted this"
1996,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"challenge of Benedick, had not the justice of Heaven at the moment"
1997,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,brought to pass a better proof of the innocence of Hero than the
1998,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,uncertain fortune of a duel.
1999,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
2000,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,While the prince and Claudio were yet talking of the challenge of
2001,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Benedick, a magistrate brought Borachio as a prisoner before the"
2002,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,prince. Borachio had been overheard talking with one of his companions
2003,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,of the mischief he had been employed by Don John to do.
2004,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
2005,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Borachio made a full confession to the prince in Claudio's hearing,"
2006,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,that it was Margaret dressed in her lady's clothes that he had talked
2007,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"with from the window, whom they had mistaken for the lady Hero"
2008,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,herself; and no doubt continued on the minds of Claudio and the prince
2009,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"of the innocence of Hero. If a suspicion had remained, it must have"
2010,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"been removed by the flight of Don John, who, finding his villanies"
2011,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"were detected, fled from Messina to avoid the just anger of his"
2012,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,brother.
2013,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
2014,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"The heart of Claudio was sorely grieved, when he found he had falsely"
2015,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"accused Hero, who, he thought, died upon hearing his cruel words; and"
2016,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"the memory of his beloved Hero's image came over him, in the rare"
2017,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,semblance that he loved it first: and the prince asking him if what
2018,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"he heard did not run like iron through his soul, he answered, that he"
2019,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,felt as if he had taken poison while Borachio was speaking.
2020,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
2021,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,And the repentant Claudio implored forgiveness of the old man Leonato
2022,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"for the injury he had done his child; and promised, that whatever"
2023,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,penance Leonato would lay upon him for his fault in believing the
2024,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"false accusation against his betrothed wife, for her dear sake he"
2025,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,would endure it.
2026,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
2027,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"The penance Leonato enjoined him was, to marry the next morning a"
2028,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"cousin of Hero's who, he said, was now his heir, and in person very"
2029,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"like Hero. Claudio, regarding the solemn promise he had made to"
2030,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Leonato, said, he would marry this unknown lady, even though she were"
2031,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"an Ethiop: but his heart was very sorrowful, and he passed that night"
2032,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"in tears, and in remorseful grief, at the tomb which Leonato had"
2033,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,erected for Hero.
2034,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,
2035,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"When the morning came, the prince accompanied Claudio to the church,"
2036,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"where the good friar, and Leonato and his niece, were already"
2037,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"assembled, to celebrate a second nuptial: and Leonato presented to"
2038,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Claudio his promised bride; and she wore a mask, that Claudio might"
2039,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"not discover her face. And Claudio said to the lady in the mask,"
2040,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"""Give me your hand, before this holy friar; I am your husband, if you"
2041,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"will marry me."" ""And when I lived, I was your other wife,"" said this"
2042,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"unknown lady; and, taking off her mask, she proved to be no niece (as"
2043,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"was pretended), but Leonato's very daughter, the lady Hero herself. We"
2044,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"may be sure that this proved a most agreeable surprise to Claudio, who"
2045,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"thought her dead, so that he could scarcely for joy believe his eyes:"
2046,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"and the prince, who was equally amazed at what he saw, exclaimed"
2047,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"""Is not this Hero, Hero that was dead?"" Leonato replied, ""She died,"
2048,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"my lord, but while her slander lived."" The friar promised them an"
2049,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"explanation of this seeming miracle, after the ceremony was ended; and"
2050,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"was proceeding to marry them, when he was interrupted by Benedick, who"
2051,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,desired to be married at the same time to Beatrice. Beatrice making
2052,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"some demur to this match, and Benedick challenging her with her love"
2053,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"for him, which he had learned from Hero, a pleasant explanation took"
2054,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,place; and they found they had both been tricked into a belief of
2055,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"love, which had never existed, and had become lovers in truth by the"
2056,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"power of a false jest: but the affection, which a merry invention had"
2057,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"cheated them into, was grown too powerful to be shaken by a serious"
2058,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"explanation; and since Benedick proposed to marry, he was resolved to"
2059,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,think nothing to the purpose that the world could say against it; and
2060,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"he merrily kept up the jest, and swore to Beatrice, that he took her"
2061,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"but for pity, and because he heard she was dying of love for him; and"
2062,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Beatrice protested, that she yielded but upon great persuasion, and"
2063,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"partly to save his life, for she heard he was in a consumption. So"
2064,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"these two mad wits were reconciled, and made a match of it, after"
2065,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Claudio and Hero were married; and to complete the history, Don John,"
2066,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"the contriver of the villany, was taken in his flight, and brought"
2067,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"back to Messina; and a brave punishment it was to this gloomy,"
2068,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"discontented man, to see the joy and feastings which, by the"
2069,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"disappointment of his plots, took place at the palace in Messina."

2076,AS YOU LIKE IT,(_By Mary Lamb_)
2077,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2078,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2079,AS YOU LIKE IT,During the time that France was divided into provinces (or dukedoms as
2080,AS YOU LIKE IT,"they were called), there reigned in one of these provinces an usurper,"
2081,AS YOU LIKE IT,"who, had deposed and banished his elder brother, the lawful duke."
2082,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2083,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The duke, who was thus driven from his dominions, retired with a few"
2084,AS YOU LIKE IT,faithful followers to the forest of Arden; and here the good duke
2085,AS YOU LIKE IT,"lived with his loving friends, who had put themselves into a voluntary"
2086,AS YOU LIKE IT,"exile for his sake, while their lands and revenues enriched the false"
2087,AS YOU LIKE IT,usurper; and custom soon made the life of careless ease they led here
2088,AS YOU LIKE IT,more sweet to them than the pomp and uneasy splendour of a courtier's
2089,AS YOU LIKE IT,"life. Here they lived like the old Robin Hood of England, and to this"
2090,AS YOU LIKE IT,"forest many noble youths daily resorted from the court, and did fleet"
2091,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the time carelessly, as they did who lived in the golden age. In the"
2092,AS YOU LIKE IT,"summer they lay along under the fine shade of the large forest trees,"
2093,AS YOU LIKE IT,marking the playful sports of the wild deer; and so fond were they of
2094,AS YOU LIKE IT,"these poor dappled fools, who seemed to be the native inhabitants of"
2095,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the forest, that it grieved them to be forced to kill them to supply"
2096,AS YOU LIKE IT,themselves with venison for their food. When the cold winds of winter
2097,AS YOU LIKE IT,"made the duke feel the change of his adverse fortune, he would endure"
2098,AS YOU LIKE IT,"it patiently, and say, ""These chilling winds which blow upon my body,"
2099,AS YOU LIKE IT,"are true counsellors, they do not flatter, but represent truly to me"
2100,AS YOU LIKE IT,"my condition; and though they bite sharply, their tooth is nothing"
2101,AS YOU LIKE IT,"like so keen as that of unkindness and ingratitude. I find that,"
2102,AS YOU LIKE IT,"howsoever men speak against adversity, yet some sweet uses are to be"
2103,AS YOU LIKE IT,"extracted from it; like the jewel, precious for medicine, which is"
2104,AS YOU LIKE IT,"taken from the head of the venomous and despised toad."" In this manner"
2105,AS YOU LIKE IT,did the patient duke draw an useful moral from everything that he saw;
2106,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and by the help of this moralising turn, in that life of his, remote"
2107,AS YOU LIKE IT,"from public haunts, he could find tongues in trees, books in the"
2108,AS YOU LIKE IT,"running brooks, sermons in stones, and good in every thing."
2109,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2110,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The banished duke had an only daughter, named Rosalind, whom the"
2111,AS YOU LIKE IT,"usurper, duke Frederick, when he banished her father, still retained"
2112,AS YOU LIKE IT,in his court as a companion for his own daughter Celia. A strict
2113,AS YOU LIKE IT,"friendship subsisted between these ladies, which the disagreement"
2114,AS YOU LIKE IT,"between their fathers did not in the least interrupt, Celia striving"
2115,AS YOU LIKE IT,by every kindness in her power to make amends to Rosalind for the
2116,AS YOU LIKE IT,injustice of her own father in deposing the father of Rosalind;
2117,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and whenever the thoughts of her father's banishment, and her own"
2118,AS YOU LIKE IT,"dependance on the false usurper, made Rosalind melancholy, Celia's"
2119,AS YOU LIKE IT,whole care was to comfort and console her.
2120,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2121,AS YOU LIKE IT,"One day, when Celia was talking in her usual kind manner to Rosalind,"
2122,AS YOU LIKE IT,"saying, ""I pray you, Rosalind, my sweet cousin, be merry,"" a messenger"
2123,AS YOU LIKE IT,"entered from the duke, to tell them that if they wished to see a"
2124,AS YOU LIKE IT,"wrestling match, which was just going to begin, they must come"
2125,AS YOU LIKE IT,"instantly to the court before the palace; and Celia, thinking it would"
2126,AS YOU LIKE IT,"amuse Rosalind, agreed to go and see it."
2127,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2128,AS YOU LIKE IT,"In those times wrestling, which is only practised now by country"
2129,AS YOU LIKE IT,"clowns, was a favourite sport even in the courts of princes, and"
2130,AS YOU LIKE IT,before fair ladies and princesses. To this wrestling-match therefore
2131,AS YOU LIKE IT,Celia and Rosalind went. They found that it was likely to prove a
2132,AS YOU LIKE IT,"very tragical sight; for a large and powerful man, who had long been"
2133,AS YOU LIKE IT,"practised in the art of wrestling, and had slain many men in contests"
2134,AS YOU LIKE IT,"of this kind, was just going to wrestle with a very young man, who,"
2135,AS YOU LIKE IT,"from his extreme youth and inexperience in the art, the beholders all"
2136,AS YOU LIKE IT,thought would certainly be killed.
2137,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2138,AS YOU LIKE IT,"When the duke saw Celia and Rosalind, he said, ""How now, daughter and"
2139,AS YOU LIKE IT,"niece, are you crept hither to see the wrestling? You will take little"
2140,AS YOU LIKE IT,"delight in it, there is such odds in the men: in pity to this young"
2141,AS YOU LIKE IT,"roan, I would wish to persuade him from wrestling. Speak to him,"
2142,AS YOU LIKE IT,"ladies, and see if you can move him."""
2143,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2144,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The ladies were well pleased to perform this humane office, and first"
2145,AS YOU LIKE IT,Celia entreated the young stranger that he would desist from the
2146,AS YOU LIKE IT,"attempt; and then Rosalind spoke so kindly to him, and with such"
2147,AS YOU LIKE IT,"feeling consideration for the danger he was about to undergo, that"
2148,AS YOU LIKE IT,"instead of being persuaded by her gentle words to forego his purpose,"
2149,AS YOU LIKE IT,all his thoughts were bent to distinguish himself by his courage in
2150,AS YOU LIKE IT,this lovely lady's eyes. He refused the request of Celia and Rosalind
2151,AS YOU LIKE IT,"in such graceful and modest words, that they felt still more concern"
2152,AS YOU LIKE IT,"for him; he concluded his refusal with saying, ""I am sorry to deny"
2153,AS YOU LIKE IT,such fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and
2154,AS YOU LIKE IT,"gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein if I be conquered, there"
2155,AS YOU LIKE IT,"is one shamed that was never gracious; if I am killed, there is one"
2156,AS YOU LIKE IT,"dead that is willing to die: I shall do my friends no wrong, for I"
2157,AS YOU LIKE IT,"have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing;"
2158,AS YOU LIKE IT,for I only fill up a place in the world which may be better supplied
2159,AS YOU LIKE IT,"when I have made it empty."""
2160,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2161,AS YOU LIKE IT,And now the wrestling-match began. Celia wished the young stranger
2162,AS YOU LIKE IT,might not be hurt; but Rosalind felt most for him. The friendless
2163,AS YOU LIKE IT,"state which he said he was in, and that he wished to die, made"
2164,AS YOU LIKE IT,Rosalind think that he was like herself unfortunate; and she pitied
2165,AS YOU LIKE IT,"him so much, and so deep an interest she took in his danger while he"
2166,AS YOU LIKE IT,"was wrestling, that she might almost be said at that moment to have"
2167,AS YOU LIKE IT,fallen in love with him.
2168,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2169,AS YOU LIKE IT,The kindness shewn this unknown youth by these fair and noble ladies
2170,AS YOU LIKE IT,"gave him courage and strength, so that he performed wonders; and in"
2171,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the end completely conquered his antagonist, who was so much hurt,"
2172,AS YOU LIKE IT,that for a while he was unable to speak or move.
2173,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2174,AS YOU LIKE IT,The duke Frederick was much pleased with the courage and skill shewn
2175,AS YOU LIKE IT,"by this young stranger; and desired to know his name and parentage,"
2176,AS YOU LIKE IT,meaning to take him under his protection.
2177,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2178,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The stranger said his name was Orlando, and that he was the youngest"
2179,AS YOU LIKE IT,son of sir Rowland de Boys.
2180,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2181,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Sir Rowland de Boys, the father of Orlando, had been dead some years;"
2182,AS YOU LIKE IT,"but when he was living, he had been a true subject and dear friend of"
2183,AS YOU LIKE IT,the banished duke: therefore when Frederick heard Orlando was the son
2184,AS YOU LIKE IT,"of his banished brother's friend, all his liking for this brave young"
2185,AS YOU LIKE IT,"man was changed into displeasure, and he left the place in very ill"
2186,AS YOU LIKE IT,"humour. Hating to hear the very name of any of his brother's friends,"
2187,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and yet still admiring the valour of the youth, he said, as he went"
2188,AS YOU LIKE IT,"out, that he wished Orlando had been the son of any other man."
2189,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2190,AS YOU LIKE IT,Rosalind was delighted to hear that her new favourite was the son
2191,AS YOU LIKE IT,"of her father's old friend; and she said to Celia, ""My father loved"
2192,AS YOU LIKE IT,"sir Rowland de Boys, and if I had known this young man was his son,"
2193,AS YOU LIKE IT,I would have added tears to my entreaties before he should have
2194,AS YOU LIKE IT,"ventured."""
2195,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2196,AS YOU LIKE IT,The ladies then went up to him; and seeing him abashed by the sudden
2197,AS YOU LIKE IT,"displeasure shewn by the duke, they spoke kind and encouraging words"
2198,AS YOU LIKE IT,"to him; and Rosalind, when they were going away, turned back to speak"
2199,AS YOU LIKE IT,some more civil things to the brave young son of her father's old
2200,AS YOU LIKE IT,"friend; and taking a chain from off her neck, she said, ""Gentleman,"
2201,AS YOU LIKE IT,"wear this for me. I am out of suits with fortune, or I would give you"
2202,AS YOU LIKE IT,"a more valuable present."""
2203,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2204,AS YOU LIKE IT,"When the ladies were alone, Rosalind's talk being still of Orlando,"
2205,AS YOU LIKE IT,Celia began to perceive her cousin had fallen in love with the
2206,AS YOU LIKE IT,"handsome young wrestler, and she said to Rosalind, ""Is it possible"
2207,AS YOU LIKE IT,"you should fall in love so suddenly?"" Rosalind replied, ""The duke,"
2208,AS YOU LIKE IT,"my father, loved his father dearly."" ""But,"" said Celia, ""does it"
2209,AS YOU LIKE IT,therefore follow that you should love his son dearly? for then I
2210,AS YOU LIKE IT,"ought to hate him, for my father hated his father; yet I do not hate"
2211,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Orlando."""
2212,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2213,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Frederick being enraged at the sight of sir Rowland de Boys' son,"
2214,AS YOU LIKE IT,which reminded him of the many friends the banished duke had among the
2215,AS YOU LIKE IT,"nobility, and having been for some time displeased with his niece,"
2216,AS YOU LIKE IT,"because the people praised her for her virtues, and pitied her for her"
2217,AS YOU LIKE IT,"good father's sake, his malice suddenly broke out against her; and"
2218,AS YOU LIKE IT,"while Celia and Rosalind were talking of Orlando, Frederick entered"
2219,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the room, and with looks full of anger ordered Rosalind instantly"
2220,AS YOU LIKE IT,"to leave the palace, and follow her father into banishment; telling"
2221,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Celia, who in vain pleaded for her, that he had only suffered Rosalind"
2222,AS YOU LIKE IT,"to stay upon her account. ""I did not then,"" said Celia, ""entreat you"
2223,AS YOU LIKE IT,to let her stay; for I was too young at that time to value her; but
2224,AS YOU LIKE IT,"now that I know her worth, and that we so long have slept together,"
2225,AS YOU LIKE IT,"rose at the same instant, learned, played and eat together, I cannot"
2226,AS YOU LIKE IT,"live out of her company."" Frederick replied, ""She is too subtle for"
2227,AS YOU LIKE IT,"you; her smoothness, her very silence, and her patience, speak to the"
2228,AS YOU LIKE IT,"people, and they pity her. You are a fool to plead for her, for you"
2229,AS YOU LIKE IT,will seem more bright and virtuous when she is gone; therefore open
2230,AS YOU LIKE IT,"not your lips in her favour, for the doom which I have passed upon her"
2231,AS YOU LIKE IT,"is irrevocable."""
2232,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2233,AS YOU LIKE IT,When Celia found she could not prevail upon her father to let Rosalind
2234,AS YOU LIKE IT,"remain with her, she generously resolved to accompany her; and,"
2235,AS YOU LIKE IT,"leaving her father's palace that night, she went along with her friend"
2236,AS YOU LIKE IT,"to seek Rosalind's father, the banished duke, in the forest of Arden."
2237,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2238,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Before they set out, Celia considered that it would be unsafe for"
2239,AS YOU LIKE IT,two young ladies to travel in the rich clothes they then wore; she
2240,AS YOU LIKE IT,therefore proposed that they should disguise their rank by dressing
2241,AS YOU LIKE IT,themselves like country maids. Rosalind said it would be a still
2242,AS YOU LIKE IT,greater protection if one of them was to be dressed like a man; and
2243,AS YOU LIKE IT,"so it was quickly agreed on between them, that as Rosalind was the"
2244,AS YOU LIKE IT,"tallest, she should wear the dress of a young countryman, and Celia"
2245,AS YOU LIKE IT,"should be habited like a country lass, and that they should say"
2246,AS YOU LIKE IT,"they were brother and sister, and Rosalind said she would be called"
2247,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Ganimed, and Celia chose the name of Aliena."
2248,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2249,AS YOU LIKE IT,"In this disguise, and taking their money and jewels to defray their"
2250,AS YOU LIKE IT,"expences, these fair princesses set out on their long travel; for"
2251,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the forest of Arden was a long way off, beyond the boundaries of the"
2252,AS YOU LIKE IT,duke's dominions.
2253,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2254,AS YOU LIKE IT,The lady Rosalind (or Ganimed as she must now be called) with her
2255,AS YOU LIKE IT,manly garb seemed to have put on a manly courage. The faithful
2256,AS YOU LIKE IT,friendship Celia had shewn in accompanying Rosalind so many weary
2257,AS YOU LIKE IT,"miles, made the new brother, in recompence for this true love, exert"
2258,AS YOU LIKE IT,"a cheerful spirit, as if he were indeed Ganimed, the rustic and"
2259,AS YOU LIKE IT,"stout-hearted brother of the gentle village maiden, Aliena."
2260,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2261,AS YOU LIKE IT,"When at last they came to the forest of Arden, they no longer found"
2262,AS YOU LIKE IT,the convenient inns and good accommodations they had met with on the
2263,AS YOU LIKE IT,"road; and being in want of food and rest, Ganimed, who had so merrily"
2264,AS YOU LIKE IT,"cheered his sister with pleasant speeches, and happy remarks, all the"
2265,AS YOU LIKE IT,"way, now owned to Aliena that he was so weary, he could find in his"
2266,AS YOU LIKE IT,"heart to disgrace his man's apparel, and cry like a woman; and Aliena"
2267,AS YOU LIKE IT,declared she could go no farther; and then again Ganimed tried to
2268,AS YOU LIKE IT,"recollect that it was a man's duty to comfort and console a woman, as"
2269,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the weaker vessel: and to seem courageous to his new sister, he said,"
2270,AS YOU LIKE IT,"""Come, have a good heart, my sister Aliena; we are now at the end of"
2271,AS YOU LIKE IT,"our travel, in the forest of Arden."" But feigned manliness and forced"
2272,AS YOU LIKE IT,courage would no longer support them; for though they were in the
2273,AS YOU LIKE IT,"forest of Arden, they knew not where to find the duke: and here the"
2274,AS YOU LIKE IT,"travel of these weary ladies might have come to a sad conclusion, for"
2275,AS YOU LIKE IT,"they might have lost themselves, and have perished for want of food;"
2276,AS YOU LIKE IT,"but providentially, as they were sitting on the grass almost dying"
2277,AS YOU LIKE IT,"with fatigue and hopeless of any relief, a countryman chanced to pass"
2278,AS YOU LIKE IT,"that way, and Ganimed once more tried to speak with a manly boldness,"
2279,AS YOU LIKE IT,"saying, ""Shepherd, if love or gold can in this desert place procure"
2280,AS YOU LIKE IT,"us entertainment, I pray you bring us where we may rest ourselves;"
2281,AS YOU LIKE IT,"for this young maid, my sister, is much fatigued with travelling,"
2282,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and faints for want of food."""
2283,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2284,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The man replied, that he was only a servant to a shepherd, and that"
2285,AS YOU LIKE IT,"his master's house was just going to be sold, and therefore they would"
2286,AS YOU LIKE IT,"find but poor entertainment; but that if they would go with him, they"
2287,AS YOU LIKE IT,"should be welcome to what there was. They followed the man, the near"
2288,AS YOU LIKE IT,prospect of relief giving them fresh strength; and bought the house
2289,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and sheep of the shepherd, and took the man who conducted them to"
2290,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the shepherd's house, to wait on them; and being by this means so"
2291,AS YOU LIKE IT,"fortunately provided with a neat cottage, and well supplied with"
2292,AS YOU LIKE IT,"provisions, they agreed to stay here till they could learn in what"
2293,AS YOU LIKE IT,part of the forest the duke dwelt.
2294,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2295,AS YOU LIKE IT,"When they were rested after the fatigue of their journey, they began"
2296,AS YOU LIKE IT,"to like their new way of life, and almost fancied themselves the"
2297,AS YOU LIKE IT,shepherd and shepherdess they feigned to be; yet sometimes Ganimed
2298,AS YOU LIKE IT,remembered he had once been the same lady Rosalind who had so dearly
2299,AS YOU LIKE IT,"loved the brave Orlando, because he was the son of old sir Rowland,"
2300,AS YOU LIKE IT,her father's friend; and though Ganimed thought that Orlando was many
2301,AS YOU LIKE IT,"miles distant, even so many weary miles as they had travelled, yet it"
2302,AS YOU LIKE IT,soon appeared that Orlando was also in the forest of Arden: and in
2303,AS YOU LIKE IT,this manner this strange event came to pass.
2304,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2305,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Orlando was the youngest son of sir Rowland de Boys, who when he died"
2306,AS YOU LIKE IT,left him (Orlando being then very young) to the care of his eldest
2307,AS YOU LIKE IT,"brother Oliver, charging Oliver on his blessing to give his brother"
2308,AS YOU LIKE IT,"a good education, and provide for him as became the dignity of their"
2309,AS YOU LIKE IT,ancient house. Oliver proved an unworthy brother; and disregarding the
2310,AS YOU LIKE IT,"commands of his dying father, he never put his brother to school, but"
2311,AS YOU LIKE IT,kept him at home untaught and entirely neglected. But in his nature
2312,AS YOU LIKE IT,and in the noble qualities of his mind Orlando so much resembled his
2313,AS YOU LIKE IT,"excellent father, that without any advantages of education he seemed"
2314,AS YOU LIKE IT,like a youth who had been bred with the utmost care; and Oliver so
2315,AS YOU LIKE IT,"envied the fine person and dignified manners of his untutored brother,"
2316,AS YOU LIKE IT,that at last he wished to destroy him; and to effect this he set on
2317,AS YOU LIKE IT,"people to persuade him to wrestle with the famous wrestler, who, as"
2318,AS YOU LIKE IT,"has been before related, had killed so many men. Now it was this cruel"
2319,AS YOU LIKE IT,"brother's neglect of him which made Orlando say he wished to die,"
2320,AS YOU LIKE IT,being so friendless.
2321,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2322,AS YOU LIKE IT,"When, contrary to the wicked hopes he had formed, his brother proved"
2323,AS YOU LIKE IT,"victorious, his envy and malice knew no bounds, and he swore he would"
2324,AS YOU LIKE IT,burn the chamber where Orlando slept. He was overheard making this vow
2325,AS YOU LIKE IT,"by one that had been an old and faithful servant to their father, and"
2326,AS YOU LIKE IT,that loved Orlando because he resembled sir Rowland. This old man went
2327,AS YOU LIKE IT,"out to meet him when he returned from the duke's palace, and when he"
2328,AS YOU LIKE IT,"saw Orlando, the peril his dear young master was in made him break"
2329,AS YOU LIKE IT,"out into these passionate exclamations: ""O my gentle master, my sweet"
2330,AS YOU LIKE IT,"master, O you memory of old sir Rowland! why are you virtuous? why"
2331,AS YOU LIKE IT,"are you gentle, strong and valiant? and why would you be so fond to"
2332,AS YOU LIKE IT,overcome the famous wrestler? Your praise is come too swiftly home
2333,AS YOU LIKE IT,"before you."" Orlando, wondering what all this meant, asked him what"
2334,AS YOU LIKE IT,"was the matter? and then the old man told him how his wicked brother,"
2335,AS YOU LIKE IT,"envying the love all people bore him, and now hearing the fame he had"
2336,AS YOU LIKE IT,"gained by his victory in the duke's palace, intended to destroy him,"
2337,AS YOU LIKE IT,"by setting fire to his chamber that night; and in conclusion, advised"
2338,AS YOU LIKE IT,him to escape the danger he was in by instant flight: and knowing
2339,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Orlando had no money, Adam (for that was the good old man's name) had"
2340,AS YOU LIKE IT,"brought out with him his own little hoard, and he said, ""I have five"
2341,AS YOU LIKE IT,"hundred crowns, the thrifty hire I saved under your father, and laid"
2342,AS YOU LIKE IT,by to be provision for me when my old limbs should become unfit for
2343,AS YOU LIKE IT,"service; take that, and he that doth the ravens feed be comfort to my"
2344,AS YOU LIKE IT,age! Here is the gold; all this I give to you: let me be your servant;
2345,AS YOU LIKE IT,"though I look old, I will do the service of a younger man in all your"
2346,AS YOU LIKE IT,"business and necessities."" ""O good old man!"" said Orlando, ""how well"
2347,AS YOU LIKE IT,appears in you the constant service of the old world? You are not for
2348,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the fashion of these times. We will go along together, and before your"
2349,AS YOU LIKE IT,youthful wages are spent I shall light upon some means for both our
2350,AS YOU LIKE IT,"maintenance."""
2351,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2352,AS YOU LIKE IT,Together then this faithful servant and his loved master set out; and
2353,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Orlando and Adam travelled on, uncertain what course to pursue, till"
2354,AS YOU LIKE IT,"they came to the forest of Arden, and there they found themselves in"
2355,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the same distress for want of food, that Ganimed and Aliena had been."
2356,AS YOU LIKE IT,"They wandered on, seeking some human habitation, till they were almost"
2357,AS YOU LIKE IT,"spent with hunger and fatigue. Adam at last said, ""O my dear master,"
2358,AS YOU LIKE IT,"I die for want of food, I can go no farther!"" He then laid himself"
2359,AS YOU LIKE IT,"down, thinking to make that place his grave, and bade his dear master"
2360,AS YOU LIKE IT,"farewel. Orlando, seeing him in this weak state, took his old servant"
2361,AS YOU LIKE IT,"up in his arms, and carried him under the shelter of some pleasant"
2362,AS YOU LIKE IT,"trees, and he said to him, ""Cheerly, old Adam, rest your weary limbs"
2363,AS YOU LIKE IT,"here a while, and do not talk of dying!"""
2364,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2365,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Orlando then searched about to find some food, and he happened to"
2366,AS YOU LIKE IT,arrive at that part of the forest where the duke was; and he and his
2367,AS YOU LIKE IT,"friends were just going to eat their dinner, this royal duke being"
2368,AS YOU LIKE IT,"seated on the grass, under no other canopy than the shady covert of"
2369,AS YOU LIKE IT,some large trees.
2370,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2371,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Orlando, whom hunger had made desperate, drew his sword, intending to"
2372,AS YOU LIKE IT,"take their meat by force, and said, ""Forbear, and eat no more; I must"
2373,AS YOU LIKE IT,"have your food!"" The duke asked him, if distress had made him so bold,"
2374,AS YOU LIKE IT,"or if he were a rude despiser of good manners? On this Orlando said,"
2375,AS YOU LIKE IT,he was dying with hunger; and then the duke told him he was welcome to
2376,AS YOU LIKE IT,"sit down and eat with them. Orlando, hearing him speak so gently, put"
2377,AS YOU LIKE IT,"up his sword, and blushed with shame at the rude manner in which he"
2378,AS YOU LIKE IT,"had demanded their food. ""Pardon me, I pray you,"" said he: ""I thought"
2379,AS YOU LIKE IT,"that all things had been savage here, and therefore I put on the"
2380,AS YOU LIKE IT,"countenance of stern command; but whatever men you are, that in this"
2381,AS YOU LIKE IT,"desert, under the shade of melancholy boughs, lose and neglect the"
2382,AS YOU LIKE IT,creeping hours of time; if ever you have looked on better days; if
2383,AS YOU LIKE IT,ever you have been where bells have knolled to church; if you have
2384,AS YOU LIKE IT,ever sate at any good man's feast; if ever from your eyelids you have
2385,AS YOU LIKE IT,"wiped a tear, and know what it is to pity or be pitied, may gentle"
2386,AS YOU LIKE IT,"speeches now move you to do me human courtesy!"" The duke replied,"
2387,AS YOU LIKE IT,"""True it is that we are men (as you say) who have seen better days,"
2388,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and though we have now our habitation in this wild forest, we have"
2389,AS YOU LIKE IT,"lived in towns and cities, and have with holy bell been knolled to"
2390,AS YOU LIKE IT,"church, have sate at good men's feasts, and from our eyes have wiped"
2391,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the drops which sacred pity has engendered: therefore sit you down,"
2392,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and take of our refreshment as much as will minister to your wants."""
2393,AS YOU LIKE IT,"""There is an old poor man,"" answered Orlando, ""who has limped after"
2394,AS YOU LIKE IT,"me many a weary step in pure love, oppressed at once with two sad"
2395,AS YOU LIKE IT,"infirmities, age and hunger; till he be satisfied, I must not touch"
2396,AS YOU LIKE IT,"a bit."" ""Go, find him out, and bring him hither,"" said the duke; ""we"
2397,AS YOU LIKE IT,"will forbear to eat till you return."" Then Orlando went like a doe to"
2398,AS YOU LIKE IT,"find its fawn and give it food; and presently returned, bringing Adam"
2399,AS YOU LIKE IT,"in his arms; and the duke said, ""Set down your venerable burthen; you"
2400,AS YOU LIKE IT,"are both welcome:"" and they fed the old man, and cheered his heart,"
2401,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and he revived, and recovered his health and strength again."
2402,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2403,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The duke enquired who Orlando was, and when he found that he was the"
2404,AS YOU LIKE IT,"son of his old friend, sir Rowland de Boys, he took him under his"
2405,AS YOU LIKE IT,"protection, and Orlando and his old servant lived with the duke in the"
2406,AS YOU LIKE IT,forest.
2407,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2408,AS YOU LIKE IT,Orlando had not been in the forest many days before Ganimed and Aliena
2409,AS YOU LIKE IT,"arrived there, and (as has been before related) bought the shepherd's"
2410,AS YOU LIKE IT,cottage.
2411,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2412,AS YOU LIKE IT,Ganimed and Aliena were strangely surprised to find the name of
2413,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Rosalind carved on the trees, and love-sonnets fastened to them, all"
2414,AS YOU LIKE IT,addressed to Rosalind; and while they were wondering how this could
2415,AS YOU LIKE IT,"be, they met Orlando, and they perceived the chain which Rosalind had"
2416,AS YOU LIKE IT,given him about his neck.
2417,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2418,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Orlando little thought that Ganimed was the fair princess Rosalind,"
2419,AS YOU LIKE IT,"who by her noble condescension and favour had so won his heart, that"
2420,AS YOU LIKE IT,"he passed his whole time in carving her name upon the trees, and"
2421,AS YOU LIKE IT,writing sonnets in praise of her beauty: but being much pleased with
2422,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the graceful air of this pretty shepherd-youth, he entered into"
2423,AS YOU LIKE IT,"conversation with him, and he thought he saw a likeness in Ganimed to"
2424,AS YOU LIKE IT,"his beloved Rosalind, but that he had none of the dignified deportment"
2425,AS YOU LIKE IT,of that noble lady; for Ganimed assumed the forward manners often seen
2426,AS YOU LIKE IT,"in youths when they are between boys and men, and with much archness"
2427,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and humour talked to Orlando of a certain lover, ""who,"" said he,"
2428,AS YOU LIKE IT,"""haunts our forest, and spoils our young trees with carving Rosalind"
2429,AS YOU LIKE IT,"upon their barks; and he hangs odes upon hawthorns, and elegies on"
2430,AS YOU LIKE IT,"brambles, all praising this same Rosalind. If I could find this lover,"
2431,AS YOU LIKE IT,I would give him some good counsel that would soon cure him of his
2432,AS YOU LIKE IT,"love."""
2433,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2434,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Orlando confessed that he was the fond lover of whom he spoke, and"
2435,AS YOU LIKE IT,asked Ganimed to give him the good counsel he talked of. The remedy
2436,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Ganimed proposed, and the counsel he gave him, was that Orlando should"
2437,AS YOU LIKE IT,come every day to the cottage where he and his sister Aliena dwelt:
2438,AS YOU LIKE IT,"""And then,"" said Ganimed, ""I will feign myself to be Rosalind, and"
2439,AS YOU LIKE IT,you shall feign to court me in the same manner as you would do if I
2440,AS YOU LIKE IT,"was Rosalind, and then I will imitate the fantastic ways of whimsical"
2441,AS YOU LIKE IT,"ladies to their lovers, till I make you ashamed of your love; and"
2442,AS YOU LIKE IT,"this is the way I propose to cure you."" Orlando had no great faith in"
2443,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the remedy, yet he agreed to come every day to Ganimed's cottage, and"
2444,AS YOU LIKE IT,feign a playful courtship; and every day Orlando visited Ganimed and
2445,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Aliena, and Orlando called the shepherd Ganimed his Rosalind, and"
2446,AS YOU LIKE IT,"every day talked over all the fine words and flattering compliments,"
2447,AS YOU LIKE IT,which young men delight to use when they court their mistresses. It
2448,AS YOU LIKE IT,does not appear however that Ganimed made any progress in curing
2449,AS YOU LIKE IT,Orlando of his love for Rosalind.
2450,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2451,AS YOU LIKE IT,Though Orlando thought all this was but a sportive play (not dreaming
2452,AS YOU LIKE IT,"that Ganimed was his very Rosalind), yet the opportunity it gave him"
2453,AS YOU LIKE IT,"of saying all the fond things he had in his heart, pleased his fancy"
2454,AS YOU LIKE IT,"almost as well as it did Ganimed's, who enjoyed the secret jest in"
2455,AS YOU LIKE IT,knowing these fine love-speeches were all addressed to the right
2456,AS YOU LIKE IT,person.
2457,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2458,AS YOU LIKE IT,In this manner many days passed pleasantly on with these young people;
2459,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and the good-natured Aliena, seeing it made Ganimed happy, let him"
2460,AS YOU LIKE IT,"have his own way, and was diverted at the mock courtship, and did not"
2461,AS YOU LIKE IT,care to remind Ganimed that the lady Rosalind had not yet made herself
2462,AS YOU LIKE IT,"known to the duke her father, whose place of resort in the forest they"
2463,AS YOU LIKE IT,"had learnt from Orlando. Ganimed met the duke one day, and had some"
2464,AS YOU LIKE IT,"talk with him, and the duke asked of what parentage he came: Ganimed"
2465,AS YOU LIKE IT,"answered, that he came of as good parentage as he did; which made the"
2466,AS YOU LIKE IT,"duke smile, for he did not suspect the pretty shepherd-boy came of"
2467,AS YOU LIKE IT,"royal lineage. Then seeing the duke look well and happy, Ganimed was"
2468,AS YOU LIKE IT,content to put off all further explanation for a few days longer.
2469,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2470,AS YOU LIKE IT,"One morning, as Orlando was going to visit Ganimed, he saw a man lying"
2471,AS YOU LIKE IT,"asleep on the ground, and a large green snake had twisted itself about"
2472,AS YOU LIKE IT,"his neck. The snake, seeing Orlando approach, glided away among the"
2473,AS YOU LIKE IT,"bushes. Orlando went nearer, and then he discovered a lioness lie"
2474,AS YOU LIKE IT,"couching, with her head on the ground, with a cat-like watch, waiting"
2475,AS YOU LIKE IT,till the sleeping man awaked (for it is said that lions will prey on
2476,AS YOU LIKE IT,nothing that is dead or sleeping). It seemed as if Orlando was sent
2477,AS YOU LIKE IT,by Providence to free the man from the danger of the snake and the
2478,AS YOU LIKE IT,"lioness: but when Orlando looked in the man's face, he perceived that"
2479,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the sleeper, who was exposed to this double peril, was his own brother"
2480,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Oliver, who had so cruelly used him, and had threatened to destroy him"
2481,AS YOU LIKE IT,by fire; and he was almost tempted to leave him a prey to the hungry
2482,AS YOU LIKE IT,lioness: but brotherly affection and the gentleness of his nature soon
2483,AS YOU LIKE IT,"overcame his first anger against his brother; and he drew his sword,"
2484,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and attacked the lioness, and slew her, and thus preserved his"
2485,AS YOU LIKE IT,brother's life both from the venomous snake and from the furious
2486,AS YOU LIKE IT,"lioness: but before Orlando could conquer the lioness, she had torn"
2487,AS YOU LIKE IT,one of his arms with her sharp claws.
2488,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2489,AS YOU LIKE IT,"While Orlando was engaged with the lioness, Oliver awaked, and"
2490,AS YOU LIKE IT,"perceiving that his brother Orlando, whom he had so cruelly treated,"
2491,AS YOU LIKE IT,was saving him from the fury of a wild beast at the risk of his own
2492,AS YOU LIKE IT,"life, shame and remorse at once seized him, and he repented of his"
2493,AS YOU LIKE IT,"unworthy conduct, and besought with many tears his brother's pardon"
2494,AS YOU LIKE IT,for the injuries he had done him. Orlando rejoiced to see him so
2495,AS YOU LIKE IT,"penitent, and readily forgave him: they embraced each other, and from"
2496,AS YOU LIKE IT,"that hour Oliver loved Orlando with a true brotherly affection, though"
2497,AS YOU LIKE IT,he had come to the forest bent on his destruction.
2498,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2499,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The wound in Orlando's arm having bled very much, he found himself too"
2500,AS YOU LIKE IT,"weak to go to visit Ganimed, and therefore he desired his brother to"
2501,AS YOU LIKE IT,"go, and tell Ganimed, ""whom,"" said Orlando, ""I in sport do call my"
2502,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Rosalind,"" the accident which had befallen him."
2503,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2504,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Thither then Oliver went, and told to Ganimed and Aliena how Orlando"
2505,AS YOU LIKE IT,had saved his life: and when he had finished the story of Orlando's
2506,AS YOU LIKE IT,"bravery, and his own providential escape, he owned to them that he was"
2507,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Orlando's brother, who had so cruelly used him; and then he told them"
2508,AS YOU LIKE IT,of their reconciliation.
2509,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2510,AS YOU LIKE IT,The sincere sorrow that Oliver expressed for his offences made such a
2511,AS YOU LIKE IT,"lively impression on the kind heart of Aliena, that she instantly"
2512,AS YOU LIKE IT,fell in love with him; and Oliver observing how much she pitied the
2513,AS YOU LIKE IT,"distress he told her he felt for his fault, he as suddenly fell in"
2514,AS YOU LIKE IT,love with her. But while love was thus stealing into the hearts of
2515,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Aliena and Oliver, he was no less busy with Ganimed, who hearing"
2516,AS YOU LIKE IT,"of the danger Orlando had been in, and that he was wounded by the"
2517,AS YOU LIKE IT,"lioness, fainted; and when he recovered, he pretended that he had"
2518,AS YOU LIKE IT,"counterfeited the swoon in the imaginary character of Rosalind,"
2519,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and Ganimed said to Oliver, ""Tell your brother Orlando how well"
2520,AS YOU LIKE IT,"I counterfeited a swoon."" But Oliver saw by the paleness of his"
2521,AS YOU LIKE IT,"complexion that he did really faint, and much wondering at the"
2522,AS YOU LIKE IT,"weakness of the young man, he said, ""Well, if you did counterfeit,"
2523,AS YOU LIKE IT,"take a good heart, and counterfeit to be a man."" ""So I do,"" replied"
2524,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Ganimed (truly), ""but I should have been a woman by right."""
2525,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2526,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Oliver made this visit a very long one, and when at last he returned"
2527,AS YOU LIKE IT,"back to his brother, he had much news to tell him; for besides the"
2528,AS YOU LIKE IT,"account of Ganimed's fainting at the hearing that Orlando was wounded,"
2529,AS YOU LIKE IT,Oliver told him how he had fallen in love with the fair shepherdess
2530,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Aliena, and that she had lent a favourable ear to his suit, even in"
2531,AS YOU LIKE IT,"this their first interview; and he talked to his brother, as of a"
2532,AS YOU LIKE IT,"thing almost settled, that he should marry Aliena, saying, that he so"
2533,AS YOU LIKE IT,"well loved her, that he would live here as a shepherd, and settle his"
2534,AS YOU LIKE IT,estate and house at home upon Orlando.
2535,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2536,AS YOU LIKE IT,"""You have my consent,"" said Orlando. ""Let your wedding be to-morrow,"
2537,AS YOU LIKE IT,and I will invite the duke and his friends. Go and persuade your
2538,AS YOU LIKE IT,"shepherdess to agree to this: she is now alone; for look, here comes"
2539,AS YOU LIKE IT,"her brother."" Oliver went to Aliena; and Ganimed, whom Orlando had"
2540,AS YOU LIKE IT,"perceived approaching, came to enquire after the health of his wounded"
2541,AS YOU LIKE IT,friend.
2542,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2543,AS YOU LIKE IT,When Orlando and Ganimed began to talk over the sudden love which had
2544,AS YOU LIKE IT,"taken place between Oliver and Aliena, Orlando said he had advised his"
2545,AS YOU LIKE IT,"brother to persuade his fair shepherdess to be married on the morrow,"
2546,AS YOU LIKE IT,and then he added how much he could wish to be married on the same day
2547,AS YOU LIKE IT,to his Rosalind.
2548,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2549,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Ganimed, who well approved of this arrangement, said, that if Orlando"
2550,AS YOU LIKE IT,"really loved Rosalind as well as he professed to do, he should have"
2551,AS YOU LIKE IT,his wish; for on the morrow he would engage to make Rosalind appear
2552,AS YOU LIKE IT,"in her own person, and also that Rosalind should be willing to marry"
2553,AS YOU LIKE IT,Orlando.
2554,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2555,AS YOU LIKE IT,"This seemingly wonderful event, which, as Ganimed was the lady"
2556,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Rosalind, he could so easily perform, he pretended he would bring to"
2557,AS YOU LIKE IT,"pass by the aid of magic, which he said he had learnt of an uncle who"
2558,AS YOU LIKE IT,was a famous magician.
2559,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2560,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The fond lover Orlando, half believing and half doubting what he"
2561,AS YOU LIKE IT,"heard, asked Ganimed if he spoke in sober meaning. ""By my life I do,"""
2562,AS YOU LIKE IT,"said Ganimed; ""therefore put on your best clothes, and bid the duke"
2563,AS YOU LIKE IT,and your friends to your wedding; for if you desire to be married
2564,AS YOU LIKE IT,"to-morrow to Rosalind, she shall be here."""
2565,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2566,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The next morning, Oliver having obtained the consent of Aliena, they"
2567,AS YOU LIKE IT,"came into the presence of the duke, and with them also came Orlando."
2568,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2569,AS YOU LIKE IT,"They being all assembled to celebrate this double marriage, and as"
2570,AS YOU LIKE IT,"yet only one of the brides appearing, there was much of wondering and"
2571,AS YOU LIKE IT,"conjecture, but they mostly thought that Ganimed was making a jest of"
2572,AS YOU LIKE IT,Orlando.
2573,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2574,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The duke, hearing that it was his own daughter that was to be brought"
2575,AS YOU LIKE IT,"in this strange way, asked Orlando if he believed the shepherd-boy"
2576,AS YOU LIKE IT,could really do what he had promised; and while Orlando was answering
2577,AS YOU LIKE IT,"that he knew not what to think, Ganimed entered, and asked the duke,"
2578,AS YOU LIKE IT,"if he brought his daughter, whether he would consent to her marriage"
2579,AS YOU LIKE IT,"with Orlando. ""That I would,"" said the duke, ""if I had kingdoms to"
2580,AS YOU LIKE IT,"give with her."" Ganimed then said to Orlando, ""And you say you will"
2581,AS YOU LIKE IT,"marry her if I bring her here."" ""That I would,"" said Orlando, ""if I"
2582,AS YOU LIKE IT,"were king of many kingdoms."""
2583,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2584,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Ganimed and Aliena then went out together, and Ganimed throwing off"
2585,AS YOU LIKE IT,"his male attire, and being once more dressed in woman's apparel,"
2586,AS YOU LIKE IT,"quickly became Rosalind without the power of magic; and Aliena,"
2587,AS YOU LIKE IT,"changing her country garb for her own rich clothes, was with as little"
2588,AS YOU LIKE IT,trouble transformed into the lady Celia.
2589,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2590,AS YOU LIKE IT,"While they were gone, the duke said to Orlando, that he thought the"
2591,AS YOU LIKE IT,"shepherd Ganimed very like his daughter Rosalind; and Orlando said, he"
2592,AS YOU LIKE IT,also had observed the resemblance.
2593,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2594,AS YOU LIKE IT,"They had no time to wonder how all this would end, for Rosalind and"
2595,AS YOU LIKE IT,Celia in their own clothes entered; and no longer pretending that it
2596,AS YOU LIKE IT,"was by the power of magic that she came there, Rosalind threw herself"
2597,AS YOU LIKE IT,"on her knees before her father, and begged his blessing. It seemed so"
2598,AS YOU LIKE IT,"wonderful to all present that she should so suddenly appear, that it"
2599,AS YOU LIKE IT,might well have passed for magic; but Rosalind would no longer trifle
2600,AS YOU LIKE IT,"with her father, and told him the story of her banishment, and of her"
2601,AS YOU LIKE IT,"dwelling in the forest as a shepherd-boy, her cousin Celia passing as"
2602,AS YOU LIKE IT,her sister.
2603,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2604,AS YOU LIKE IT,The duke ratified the consent he had already given to the marriage;
2605,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and Orlando and Rosalind, Oliver and Celia, were married at the same"
2606,AS YOU LIKE IT,time. And though their wedding could not be celebrated in this wild
2607,AS YOU LIKE IT,"forest with any of the parade or splendour usual on such occasions,"
2608,AS YOU LIKE IT,yet a happier wedding-day was never passed: and while they were eating
2609,AS YOU LIKE IT,"their venison under the cool shade of the pleasant trees, as if"
2610,AS YOU LIKE IT,nothing should be wanting to complete the felicity of this good duke
2611,AS YOU LIKE IT,"and the true lovers, an unexpected messenger arrived to tell the duke"
2612,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the joyful news, that his dukedom was restored to him."

2614,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The usurper, enraged at the flight of his daughter Celia, and hearing"
2615,AS YOU LIKE IT,that every day men of great worth resorted to the forest of Arden
2616,AS YOU LIKE IT,"to join the lawful duke in his exile, much envying that his brother"
2617,AS YOU LIKE IT,"should be so highly respected in his adversity, put himself at the"
2618,AS YOU LIKE IT,"head of a large force, and advanced towards the forest, intending to"
2619,AS YOU LIKE IT,"seize his brother, and put him, with all his faithful followers, to"
2620,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the sword; but, by a wonderful interposition of Providence, this bad"
2621,AS YOU LIKE IT,brother was converted from his evil intention: for just as he entered
2622,AS YOU LIKE IT,"the skirts of the wild forest he was met by an old religious man, a"
2623,AS YOU LIKE IT,"hermit, with whom he had much talk, and who in the end completely"
2624,AS YOU LIKE IT,turned his heart from his wicked design. Thenceforward he became a
2625,AS YOU LIKE IT,"true penitent, and resolved, relinquishing his unjust dominion, to"
2626,AS YOU LIKE IT,spend the remainder of his days in a religious house. The first act of
2627,AS YOU LIKE IT,his newly-conceived penitence was to send a messenger to his brother
2628,AS YOU LIKE IT,"(as has been related), to offer to restore to him his dukedom, which"

2631,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2632,AS YOU LIKE IT,"This joyful news, as unexpected as it was welcome, came opportunely"
2633,AS YOU LIKE IT,to heighten the festivity and rejoicings at the wedding of the

2635,AS YOU LIKE IT,"had happened to the duke, Rosalind's father, and wished her joy very"
2636,AS YOU LIKE IT,"sincerely, though she herself was no longer heir to the dukedom, but"
2637,AS YOU LIKE IT,"by this restoration which her father had made, Rosalind was now the"

2640,AS YOU LIKE IT,
2641,AS YOU LIKE IT,The duke had now an opportunity of rewarding those true friends who

2643,AS YOU LIKE IT,"though they had patiently shared his adverse fortune, were very well"

2653,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2654,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2655,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"There lived in the city of Verona two young gentlemen, whose names"
2656,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"were Valentine and Protheus, between whom a firm and uninterrupted"
2657,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"friendship had long subsisted. They pursued their studies together,"
2658,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and their hours of leisure were always passed in each other's company,"
2659,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,except when Protheus visited a lady he was in love with; and these
2660,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"visits to his mistress, and this passion of Protheus for the fair"
2661,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Julia, were the only topics on which these two friends disagreed: for"
2662,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine, not being himself a lover, was sometimes a little weary of"
2663,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"hearing his friend for ever talking of his Julia, and then he would"
2664,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"laugh at Protheus, and in pleasant terms ridicule the passion of love,"
2665,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and declare that no such idle fancies should ever enter his head,"
2666,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"greatly preferring (as he said) the free and happy life he led, to the"
2667,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,anxious hopes and fears of the lover Protheus.
2668,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2669,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,One morning Valentine came to Protheus to tell him that they must
2670,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"for a time be separated, for that he was going to Milan. Protheus,"
2671,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"unwilling to part with his friend, used many arguments to prevail upon"
2672,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine not to leave him; but Valentine said, ""Cease to persuade me,"
2673,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"my loving Protheus. I will not, like a sluggard, wear out my youth in"
2674,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,idleness at home. Home-keeping youths have ever homely wits. If your
2675,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,affection were not chained to the sweet glances of your honoured
2676,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Julia, I would entreat you to accompany me, to see the wonders of the"
2677,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"world abroad: but since you are a lover, love on still, and may your"
2678,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"love be prosperous!"""
2679,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2680,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"They parted with mutual expressions of unalterable friendship. ""Sweet"
2681,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine, adieu!"" said Protheus; ""think on me, when you see some rare"
2682,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"object worthy of notice in your travels, and wish me partaker of your"
2683,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"happiness."""
2684,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2685,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Valentine began his journey that same day towards Milan; and when his
2686,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"friend had left him, Protheus sat down to write a letter to Julia,"
2687,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,which he gave to her maid Lucetta to deliver to her mistress.
2688,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2689,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Julia loved Protheus as well as he did her, but she was a lady of a"
2690,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"noble spirit, and she thought it did not become her maiden dignity"
2691,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,too easily to be won; therefore she affected to be insensible of his
2692,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"passion, and gave him much uneasiness in the prosecution of his suit."
2693,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2694,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"And when Lucetta offered the letter to Julia, she would not receive"
2695,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"it, and chid her maid for taking letters from Protheus, and ordered"
2696,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,her to leave the room. But she so much wished to see what was written
2697,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"in the letter, that she soon called in her maid again, and when"
2698,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Lucetta returned, she said, ""What o'clock is it?"" Lucetta, who knew"
2699,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,her mistress more desired to see the letter than to know the time
2700,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"of day, without answering her question, again offered the rejected"
2701,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"letter. Julia, angry that her maid should thus take the liberty of"
2702,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"seeming to know what she really wanted, tore the letter in pieces, and"
2703,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"threw it on the floor, ordering her maid once more out of the room."
2704,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"As Lucetta was retiring, she stooped to pick up the fragments of the"
2705,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"torn letter; but Julia, who meant not so to part with them, said, in"
2706,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"pretended anger, ""Go, get you gone, and let the papers lie; you would"
2707,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"be fingering them to anger me."""
2708,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2709,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Julia then began to piece together as well as she could the torn
2710,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"fragments. She first made out these words, ""Love-wounded Protheus;"""
2711,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and lamenting over these and such-like loving words, which she made"
2712,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"out though they were all torn asunder, or, she said, _wounded_ (the"
2713,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"expression ""Love-wounded Protheus,"" giving her that idea), she talked"
2714,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"to these kind words, telling them she would lodge them in her bosom as"
2715,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"in a bed, till their wounds were healed, and that she would kiss each"
2716,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"several piece, to make amends."
2717,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2718,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,In this manner she went on talking with a pretty lady-like
2719,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"childishness, till finding herself unable to make out the whole, and"
2720,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"vext at her own ingratitude in destroying such sweet and loving words,"
2721,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"as she called them, she wrote a much kinder letter to Protheus than"
2722,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,she had ever done before.
2723,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2724,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Protheus was greatly delighted at receiving this favourable answer
2725,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"to his letter; and while he was reading it, he exclaimed, ""Sweet"
2726,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"love, sweet lines, sweet life!"" In the midst of his raptures he was"
2727,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"interrupted by his father. ""How now!"" said the old gentleman; ""what"
2728,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"letter are you reading there?"""
2729,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2730,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""My lord,"" replied Protheus, ""it is a letter from my friend Valentine,"
2731,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"at Milan."""
2732,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2733,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""Lend me the letter,"" said his father: ""let me see what news."""
2734,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2735,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""There are no news, my lord,"" said Protheus, greatly alarmed, ""but"
2736,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"that he writes how well beloved he is of the duke of Milan, who daily"
2737,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"graces him with favours; and how he wishes me with him, the partner of"
2738,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"his fortune."""
2739,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2740,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""And how stand you affected to his wish?"" asked the father."
2741,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2742,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""As one relying on your lordship's will, and not depending on his"
2743,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"friendly wish,"" said Protheus."
2744,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2745,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Now it had happened that Protheus' father had just been talking with
2746,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"a friend on this very subject: his friend had said, he wondered his"
2747,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"lordship suffered his son to spend his youth at home, while most"
2748,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"men were sending their sons to seek preferment abroad; ""some,"" said"
2749,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"he, ""to the wars, to try their fortunes there, and some to discover"
2750,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"islands far away, and some to study in foreign universities; and there"
2751,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"is his companion Valentine, he is gone to the duke of Milan's court."
2752,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Your son is fit for any of these things, and it will be a great"
2753,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"disadvantage to him in his riper age, not to have travelled in his"
2754,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"youth."""
2755,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2756,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Protheus' father thought the advice of his friend was very good,"
2757,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and upon Protheus telling him that Valentine ""wished him with him,"
2758,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"the partner of his fortune,"" he at once determined to send his son"
2759,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,to Milan; and without giving Protheus any reason for this sudden
2760,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"resolution, it being the usual habit of this positive old gentleman to"
2761,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"command his son, not reason with him, he said, ""My will is the same"
2762,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"as Valentine's wish:"" and seeing his son looked astonished, he added,"
2763,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""Look not amazed, that I so suddenly resolve you shall spend some time"
2764,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"in the duke of Milan's court; for what I will I will, and there is"
2765,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,an end. To-morrow be in readiness to go. Make no excuses; for I am
2766,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"peremptory."""
2767,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2768,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Protheus knew it was of no use to make objections to his father, who"
2769,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,never suffered him to dispute his will; and he blamed himself for
2770,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"telling his father an untruth about Julia's letter, which had brought"
2771,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,upon him the sad necessity of leaving her.
2772,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2773,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Now that Julia found she was going to lose Protheus for so long a
2774,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"time, she no longer pretended indifference; and they bade each other"
2775,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,a mournful farewell with many vows of love and constancy. Protheus
2776,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and Julia exchanged rings, which they both promised to keep for ever"
2777,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"in remembrance of each other; and thus, taking a sorrowful leave,"
2778,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Protheus set out on his journey to Milan, the abode of his friend"
2779,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Valentine.
2780,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2781,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine was in reality what Protheus had feigned to his father, in"
2782,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,high favour with the duke of Milan; and another event had happened to
2783,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"him, of which Protheus did not even dream, for Valentine had given"
2784,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"up the freedom of which he used so much to boast, and was become as"
2785,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,passionate a lover as Protheus.
2786,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2787,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"She who had wrought this wondrous change in Valentine, was the lady"
2788,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Silvia, daughter of the duke of Milan, and she also loved him; but"
2789,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"they concealed their love from the duke, because although he shewed"
2790,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"much kindness for Valentine, and invited him every day to his palace,"
2791,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,yet he designed to marry his daughter to a young courtier whose name
2792,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"was Thurio. Silvia despised this Thurio, for he had none of the fine"
2793,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,sense and excellent qualities of Valentine.
2794,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2795,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"These two rivals, Thurio and Valentine, were one day on a visit to"
2796,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Silvia, and Valentine was entertaining Silvia with turning every thing"
2797,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Thurio said into ridicule, when the duke himself entered the room,"
2798,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,and told Valentine the welcome news of his friend Protheus' arrival.
2799,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine said, ""If I had wished a thing, it would have been to have"
2800,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"seen him here!"" and then he highly praised Protheus to the duke,"
2801,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"saying, ""My lord, though I have been a truant of my time, yet hath my"
2802,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"friend made use and fair advantage of his days, and is complete in"
2803,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"person and in mind, in all good grace to grace a gentleman."""
2804,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2805,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""Welcome him then according to his worth,"" said the duke: ""Silvia, I"
2806,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"speak to you, and you, sir Thurio; for Valentine, I need not bid him"
2807,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"do so."" They were here interrupted by the entrance of Protheus, and"
2808,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine introduced him to Silvia, saying, ""Sweet lady, entertain him"
2809,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"to be my fellow-servant to your ladyship."""
2810,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2811,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"When Valentine and Protheus had ended their visit, and were alone"
2812,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"together, Valentine said, ""Now tell me how all does from whence"
2813,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"you came? How does your lady, and how thrives your love?"" Protheus"
2814,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"replied, ""My tales of love used to weary you. I know you joy not in a"
2815,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"love-discourse."""
2816,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2817,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""Aye, Protheus,"" returned Valentine, ""but that life is altered now. I"
2818,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,have done penance for condemning love. For in revenge of my contempt
2819,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"of Love, Love has chased sleep from my enthralled eyes. O gentle"
2820,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Protheus, Love is a mighty lord, and hath so humbled me, that I"
2821,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"confess there is no woe like his correction, nor no such joy on earth"
2822,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,as in his service. I now like no discourse except it be of love. Now I
2823,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"can break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep, upon the very name of love."""
2824,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2825,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,This acknowledgment of the change which love had made in the
2826,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,disposition of Valentine was a great triumph to his friend Protheus.
2827,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"But _friend_ Protheus must be called no longer, for the same"
2828,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"all-powerful deity Love, of whom they were speaking (yea even while"
2829,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,they were talking of the change he had made in Valentine) was working
2830,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"in the heart of Protheus; and he, who had till this time been a"
2831,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"pattern of true love and perfect friendship, was now, in one short"
2832,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"interview with Silvia, become a false friend and a faithless lover;"
2833,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"for at the first sight of Silvia, all his love for Julia vanished away"
2834,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"like a dream, nor did his long friendship for Valentine deter him"
2835,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"from endeavouring to supplant him in her affections; and although, as"
2836,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"it will always be, when people of dispositions naturally good become"
2837,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"unjust, he had many scruples, before he determined to forsake Julia,"
2838,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and become the rival of Valentine, yet he at length overcame his sense"
2839,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"of duty, and yielded himself up, almost without remorse, to his new"
2840,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,unhappy passion.
2841,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2842,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine imparted to him in confidence the whole history of his love,"
2843,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and how carefully they had concealed it from the duke her father, and"
2844,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"told him, that despairing of ever being able to obtain his consent,"
2845,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"he had prevailed upon Silvia to leave her father's palace that night,"
2846,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and go with him to Mantua; then he shewed Protheus a ladder of ropes,"
2847,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,by help of which he meant to assist Silvia to get out of one of the
2848,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"windows of the palace, after it was dark."
2849,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2850,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Upon hearing this faithful recital of his friend's dearest secrets,"
2851,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"it is hardly possible to be believed, but so it was, that Protheus"
2852,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"resolved to go to the duke, and disclose the whole to him."
2853,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2854,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,This false friend began his tale with many artful speeches to the
2855,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"duke, such as that by the laws of friendship he ought to conceal what"
2856,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"he was going to reveal, but that the gracious favour the duke had"
2857,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"shewn him, and the duty he owed his grace, urged him to tell that,"
2858,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,which else no worldly good should draw from him: he then told all he
2859,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"had heard from Valentine, not omitting the ladder of ropes, and the"
2860,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,manner in which Valentine meant to conceal them under a long cloak.
2861,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2862,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"The duke thought Protheus quite a miracle of integrity, in that he"
2863,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,preferred telling his friend's intention rather than he would conceal
2864,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"an unjust action; highly commended him, and promised him not to let"
2865,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine know from whom he had learnt this intelligence, but by some"
2866,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,artifice to make Valentine betray the secret himself. For this purpose
2867,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"the duke awaited the coming of Valentine in the evening, whom he soon"
2868,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"saw hurrying towards the palace, and he perceived somewhat was wrapped"
2869,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"within his cloak, which he concluded was the rope-ladder."
2870,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2871,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"The duke upon this stopped him, saying, ""Whither away so fast,"
2872,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine?"" ""May it please your grace,"" said Valentine, ""there is a"
2873,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"messenger, that stays to bear my letters to my friends, and I am going"
2874,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"to deliver them."" Now this falsehood of Valentine's had no better"
2875,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,success in the event than the untruth Protheus told his father.
2876,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2877,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""Be they of much import?"" said the duke."
2878,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2879,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""No more, my lord,"" said Valentine, ""than to tell my father I am well"
2880,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and happy at your grace's court."""
2881,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2882,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""Nay, then,"" said the duke, ""no matter: stay with me a while. I wish"
2883,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"your counsel about some affairs that concern me nearly."" He then told"
2884,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine an artful story, as a prelude to draw his secret from him,"
2885,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"saying, that Valentine knew he wished to match his daughter with"
2886,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Thurio, but that she was stubborn and disobedient to his commands,"
2887,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""neither regarding,"" said he, ""that she is my child, nor fearing me"
2888,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"as if I were her father. And I may say to thee, this pride of hers"
2889,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,has drawn my love from her. I had thought my age should have been
2890,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"cherished by her childlike duty. I now am resolved to take a wife,"
2891,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,and turn her out to whosoever will take her in. Let her beauty be her
2892,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"wedding-dower, for me and my possessions she esteems not."""
2893,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2894,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine, wondering where all this would end, made answer, ""And what"
2895,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"would your grace have me to do in all this?"""
2896,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2897,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""Why,"" said the duke, ""the lady I would wish to marry is nice and coy,"
2898,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and does not much esteem my aged eloquence. Besides, the fashion of"
2899,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,courtship is much changed since I was young: now I would willingly
2900,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"have you to be my tutor to instruct me how I am to woo."""
2901,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2902,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Valentine gave him a general idea of the modes of courtship then
2903,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"practised by young men, when they wished to win a fair lady's love,"
2904,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"such as presents, frequent visits, and the like."
2905,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2906,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"The duke replied to this, that the lady did refuse a present which he"
2907,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"sent her, and that she was so strictly kept by her father, that no man"
2908,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,might have access to her by day.
2909,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2910,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""Why then,"" said Valentine, ""you must visit her by night."""
2911,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2912,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""But at night,"" said the artful duke, who was now coming to the drift"
2913,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"of his discourse, ""her doors are fast locked."""
2914,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2915,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine then unfortunately proposed, that the duke should get into"
2916,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"the lady's chamber at night by means of a ladder of ropes, saying,"
2917,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,he would procure him one fitting for that purpose; and in conclusion
2918,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,advised him to conceal this ladder of ropes under such a cloak as
2919,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"that which he now wore. ""Lend me your cloak,"" said the duke, who had"
2920,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,feigned this long story on purpose to have a pretence to get off the
2921,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"cloak: so, upon saying these words, he caught hold of Valentine's"
2922,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"cloak, and throwing it back, he discovered not only the ladder of"
2923,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"ropes, but also a letter of Silvia's, which he instantly opened, and"
2924,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,read; and this letter contained a full account of their intended
2925,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"elopement. The duke, after upbraiding Valentine for his ingratitude in"
2926,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"thus returning the favour he had shewn him, by endeavouring to steal"
2927,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"away his daughter, banished him from the court and city of Milan for"
2928,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"ever; and Valentine was forced to depart that night, without even"
2929,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,seeing Silvia.
2930,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2931,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"While Protheus at Milan was thus injuring Valentine, Julia at Verona"
2932,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,was regretting the absence of Protheus; and her regard for him at last
2933,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"so far overcame her sense of propriety, that she resolved to leave"
2934,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Verona, and seek her lover at Milan; and to secure herself from"
2935,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"danger on the road, she dressed her maid Lucetta and herself in men's"
2936,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"clothes, and they set out in this disguise, and arrived at Milan, soon"
2937,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,after Valentine was banished from that city through the treachery of
2938,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Protheus.
2939,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2940,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Julia entered Milan about noon, and she took up her abode at an inn;"
2941,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and her thoughts being all on her dear Protheus, she entered into"
2942,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"conversation with the innkeeper, or host, as he was called, thinking"
2943,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,by that means to learn some news of Protheus.
2944,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2945,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,The host was greatly pleased that this handsome young gentleman (as
2946,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"he took her to be), who from his appearance he concluded was of high"
2947,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"rank, spoke so familiarly to him; and being a good-natured man, he was"
2948,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,sorry to see him look so melancholy; and to amuse his young guest he
2949,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"offered to take him to hear some fine music, with which, he said, a"
2950,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,gentleman that evening was going to serenade his mistress.
2951,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2952,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"The reason Julia looked so very melancholy was, that she did not well"
2953,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,know what Protheus would think of the imprudent step she had taken;
2954,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,for she knew he had loved her for her noble maiden-pride and dignity
2955,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"of character, and she feared she should lower herself in his esteem:"
2956,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,and this it was that made her wear a sad and thoughtful countenance.
2957,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2958,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"She gladly accepted the offer of the host to go with him, and hear the"
2959,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,music; for she secretly hoped she might meet Protheus by the way.
2960,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2961,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"But when she came to the palace whither the host conducted her, a very"
2962,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,different effect was produced to what the kind host intended; for
2963,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"there, to her heart's sorrow, she beheld her lover, the inconstant"
2964,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Protheus, serenading the lady Silvia with music, and addressing"
2965,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,discourse of love and admiration to her. And Julia overheard Silvia
2966,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"from a window talk with Protheus, and reproach him for forsaking his"
2967,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"own true lady, and for his ingratitude to his friend Valentine: and"
2968,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"then Silvia left the window, not choosing to listen to his music"
2969,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,and his fine speeches; for she was a faithful lady to her banished
2970,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine, and abhorred the ungenerous conduct of his false friend"
2971,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Protheus.
2972,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2973,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Though Julia was in despair at what she had just witnessed, yet did"
2974,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,she still love the truant Protheus; and hearing that he had lately
2975,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"parted with a servant, she contrived with the assistance of her host,"
2976,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"the friendly innkeeper, to hire herself to Protheus as a page; and"
2977,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Protheus knew not she was Julia, and he sent her with letters and"
2978,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"presents to her rival Silvia, and he even sent by her the very ring"
2979,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,she gave him as a parting gift at Verona.
2980,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
2981,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"When she went to that lady with the ring, she was most glad to find"
2982,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"that Silvia utterly rejected the suit of Protheus; and Julia, or the"
2983,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"page Sebastian, as she was called, entered into conversation with"
2984,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Silvia about Protheus' first love, the forsaken lady Julia. She"
2985,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"putting in (as one may say) a good word for herself, said she knew"
2986,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Julia; as well she might, being herself the Julia of whom she spoke:"
2987,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"telling how fondly Julia loved her master Protheus, and how his unkind"
2988,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,neglect would grieve her: and then she with a pretty equivocation went
2989,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"on: ""Julia is about my height, and of my complexion, the colour of"
2990,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"her eyes and hair the same as mine;"" and indeed Julia looked a most"
2991,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,beautiful youth in her boy's attire. Silvia was moved to pity this
2992,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"lovely lady, who was so sadly forsaken by the man she loved; and"
2993,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"when Julia offered her the ring which Protheus had sent, refused it,"
2994,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"saying, ""The more shame for him that he sends me that ring; I will not"
2995,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"take it, for I have often heard him say his Julia gave it to him. I"
2996,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"love thee, gentle youth, for pitying her, poor lady! Here is a purse;"
2997,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"I give it you for Julia's sake."" These comfortable words coming from"
2998,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,her kind rival's tongue cheered the drooping heart of the disguised
2999,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,lady.
3000,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3001,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,But to return to the banished Valentine; who scarce knew which way
3002,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"to bend his course, being unwilling to return home to his father a"
3003,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"disgraced and banished man: as he was wandering over a lonely forest,"
3004,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"not far distant from Milan, where he had left his heart's dear"
3005,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"treasure, the lady Silvia, he was set upon by robbers, who demanded"
3006,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,his money.
3007,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3008,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine told them, that he was a man crossed by adversity, that he"
3009,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"was going into banishment, and that he had no money, the clothes he"
3010,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,had on being all his riches.
3011,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3012,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"The robbers, hearing that he was a distressed man, and being struck"
3013,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"with his noble air and manly behaviour, told him, if he would live"
3014,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"with them, and be their chief, or captain, they would put themselves"
3015,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"under his command: but that if he refused to accept their offer, they"
3016,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,would kill him.
3017,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3018,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine, who cared little what became of himself, said, he would"
3019,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"consent to live with them and be their captain, provided they did no"
3020,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,outrage on women or poor passengers.
3021,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3022,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Thus the noble Valentine became, like Robin Hood, of whom we read"
3023,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"in ballads, a captain of robbers and outlawed banditti: and in this"
3024,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"situation he was found by Silvia, and in this manner it came to pass."
3025,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3026,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Silvia, to avoid a marriage with Thurio, whom her father insisted upon"
3027,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"her no longer refusing, came at last to the resolution of following"
3028,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine to Mantua, at which place she had heard her lover had taken"
3029,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"refuge; but in this account she was misinformed, for he still lived in"
3030,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"the forest among the robbers, bearing the name of their captain, but"
3031,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"taking no part in their depredations, and using the authority which"
3032,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"they had imposed upon him in no other way, than to compel them to shew"
3033,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,compassion to the travellers they robbed.
3034,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3035,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Silvia contrived to effect her escape from her father's palace in
3036,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"company with a worthy old gentleman, whose name was Eglamour, whom"
3037,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,she took along with her for protection on the road. She had to pass
3038,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,through the forest where Valentine and the banditti dwelt; and one of
3039,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"these robbers seized on Silvia, and would also have taken Eglamour,"
3040,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,but he escaped.
3041,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3042,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"The robber who had taken Silvia, seeing the terror she was in, bid"
3043,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"her not be alarmed, for that he was only going to carry her to a cave"
3044,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"where his captain lived, and that she need not be afraid, for their"
3045,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"captain had an honourable mind, and always shewed humanity to women."
3046,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Silvia found little comfort in hearing she was going to be carried as
3047,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"a prisoner before the captain of a lawless banditti. ""O Valentine,"""
3048,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"she cried, ""this I endure for thee!"""
3049,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3050,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"But as the robber was conveying her to the cave of his captain, he was"
3051,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"stopped by Protheus, who, still attended by Julia in the disguise of"
3052,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"a page, having heard of the flight of Silvia, had traced her steps to"
3053,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,this forest. Protheus now rescued her from the hands of the robber;
3054,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"but scarce had she time to thank him for the service he had done her,"
3055,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,before he began to distress her afresh with his love-suit: and while
3056,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"he was rudely pressing her to consent to marry him, and his page (the"
3057,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"forlorn Julia) was standing beside him in great anxiety of mind,"
3058,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,fearing lest the great service which Protheus had just done to Silvia
3059,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"should win her to shew him some favour, they were all strangely"
3060,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"surprised with the sudden appearance of Valentine, who having heard"
3061,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"his robbers had taken a lady prisoner, came to console and relieve"
3062,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,her.
3063,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3064,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Protheus was courting Silvia, and he was so much ashamed of being"
3065,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"caught by his friend, that he was all at once seized with penitence"
3066,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,and remorse; and he expressed such a lively sorrow for the injuries
3067,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"he had done to Valentine, that Valentine, whose nature was noble and"
3068,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"generous, even to a romantic degree, not only forgave and restored"
3069,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"him to his former place in his friendship, but in a sudden flight of"
3070,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"heroism he said, ""I freely do forgive you; and all the interest I have"
3071,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"in Silvia, I give it up to you."" Julia, who was standing beside her"
3072,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"master as a page, hearing this strange offer, and fearing Protheus"
3073,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"would not be able with this new-found virtue to refuse Silvia,"
3074,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"fainted, and they were all employed in recovering her: else would"
3075,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Silvia have been offended at being thus made over to Protheus, though"
3076,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,she could scarcely think that Valentine would long persevere in this
3077,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,overstrained and too generous act of friendship. When Julia recovered
3078,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"from the fainting fit, she said, ""I had forgot, my master ordered me"
3079,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"to deliver this ring to Silvia."" Protheus, looking upon the ring,"
3080,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"saw that it was the one he gave to Julia, in return for that which"
3081,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"he received from her, and which he had sent by the supposed page to"
3082,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Silvia. ""How is this?"" said he, ""this is Julia's ring: how came you"
3083,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"by it, boy?"" Julia answered, ""Julia herself did give it me, and Julia"
3084,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"herself hath brought it hither."""
3085,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3086,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Protheus, now looking earnestly upon her, plainly perceived that the"
3087,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,page Sebastian was no other than the lady Julia herself: and the proof
3088,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"she had given of her constancy and true love so wrought in him, that"
3089,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"his love for her returned into his heart, and he took again his own"
3090,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"dear lady, and joyfully resigned all pretensions to the lady Silvia to"
3091,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine, who had so well deserved her."
3092,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3093,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,Protheus and Valentine were expressing their happiness in their
3094,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"reconciliation, and in the love of their faithful ladies, when they"
3095,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"were surprised with the sight of the duke of Milan and Thurio, who"
3096,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,came there in pursuit of Silvia.
3097,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3098,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Thurio first approached, and attempted to seize Silvia, saying,"
3099,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""Silvia is mine."" Upon this Valentine said to him in a very spirited"
3100,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"manner, ""Thurio, keep back: if once again you say that Silvia is"
3101,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"yours, you shall embrace your death. Here she stands, take but"
3102,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,possession of her with a touch! I dare you but to breathe upon my
3103,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"love."" Hearing this threat, Thurio, who was a great coward, drew back,"
3104,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"and said he cared not for her, and that none but a fool would fight"
3105,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,for a girl who loved him not.
3106,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,
3107,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"The duke, who was a very brave man himself, said now in great anger,"
3108,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"""The more base and degenerate in you to take such means for her as you"
3109,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"have done, and leave her on such slight conditions."" Then turning to"
3110,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"Valentine, he said, ""I do applaud your spirit, Valentine, and think"
3111,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"you worthy of an empress's love. You shall have Silvia, for you have"
3112,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"well deserved her."" Valentine then with great humility kissed the"
3113,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"duke's hand, and accepted the noble present which he had made him"
3114,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,of his daughter with becoming thankfulness: taking occasion of this
3115,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,joyful minute to entreat the good-humoured duke to pardon the thieves
3116,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"with whom he had associated in the forest, assuring him, that when"
3117,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"reformed and restored to society, there would be found among them"
3118,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"many good, and fit for great employment; for the most of them had"
3119,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"been banished, like Valentine, for state offences, rather than for"
3120,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,any black crimes they had been guilty of. To this the duke readily
3121,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"consented: and now nothing remained but that Protheus, the false"
3122,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"friend, was ordained, by way of penance for his love-prompted faults,"
3123,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,to be present at the recital of the whole story of his loves and
3124,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,falsehoods before the duke; and the shame of the recital to his
3125,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,awakened conscience was judged sufficient punishment: which being
3126,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"done, the lovers, all four, returned back to Milan, and their nuptials"
3127,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,"were solemnised in presence of the duke, with high triumphs and"
3128,THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA,feasting.

3134,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3135,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,(_By Mary Lamb_)
3136,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3137,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3138,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Shylock, the Jew, lived at Venice: he was an usurer, who had amassed"
3139,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,an immense fortune by lending money at great interest to Christian
3140,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"merchants. Shylock being a hard-hearted man, exacted the payment of"
3141,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"the money he lent with such severity, that he was much disliked by all"
3142,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"good men, and particularly by Anthonio, a young merchant of Venice;"
3143,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and Shylock as much hated Anthonio, because he used to lend money to"
3144,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"people in distress, and would never take any interest for the money he"
3145,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,lent; therefore there was great enmity between this covetous Jew and
3146,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,the generous merchant Anthonio. Whenever Anthonio met Shylock on the
3147,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Rialto (or Exchange), he used to reproach him with his usuries and"
3148,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"hard dealings; which the Jew would bear with seeming patience, while"
3149,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,he secretly meditated revenge.
3150,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3151,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Anthonio was the kindest man that lived, the best conditioned, and had"
3152,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,the most unwearied spirit in doing courtesies; indeed he was one in
3153,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,whom the ancient Roman honour more appeared than in any that drew
3154,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,breath in Italy. He was greatly beloved by all his fellow-citizens;
3155,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"but the friend who was nearest and dearest to his heart was Bassanio,"
3156,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"a noble Venetian, who, having but a small patrimony, had nearly"
3157,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,exhausted his little fortune by living in too expensive a manner for
3158,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"his slender means, as young men of high rank with small fortunes are"
3159,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"too apt to do. Whenever Bassanio wanted money, Anthonio assisted him;"
3160,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,and it seemed as if they had but one heart and one purse between them.
3161,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3162,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"One day Bassanio came to Anthonio, and told him that he wished to"
3163,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,repair his fortune by a wealthy marriage with a lady whom he dearly
3164,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"loved, whose father, that was lately dead, had left her sole heiress"
3165,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,to a large estate; and that in her father's lifetime he used to visit
3166,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"at her house, when he thought he had observed this lady had sometimes"
3167,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"from her eyes sent speechless messages, that seemed to say he would"
3168,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,be no unwelcome suitor; but not having money to furnish himself with
3169,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"an appearance befitting the lover of so rich an heiress, he besought"
3170,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Anthonio to add to the many favours he had shewn him, by lending him"
3171,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,three thousand ducats.
3172,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3173,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Anthonio had no money by him at that time to lend his friend; but
3174,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"expecting soon to have some ships come home laden with merchandise,"
3175,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"he said he would go to Shylock, the rich money-lender, and borrow the"
3176,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,money upon the credit of those ships.
3177,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3178,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Anthonio and Bassanio went together to Shylock, and Anthonio asked"
3179,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,the Jew to lend him three thousand ducats upon any interest he should
3180,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"require, to be paid out of the merchandise contained in his ships at"
3181,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"sea. On this, Shylock thought within himself: ""If I can once catch him"
3182,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"on the hip, I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him: he hates"
3183,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"our Jewish nation; he lends out money gratis, and among the merchants"
3184,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"he rails at me and my well-earned bargains, which he calls interest."
3185,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Cursed be my tribe if I forgive him!"" Anthonio finding he was musing"
3186,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"within himself and did not answer, and being impatient for the money,"
3187,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"said, ""Shylock, do you hear? will you lend the money?"" To this"
3188,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"question the Jew replied, ""Signior Anthonio, on the Rialto many a time"
3189,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and often you have railed at me about my monies, and my usuries, and I"
3190,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"have borne it with a patient shrug, for sufferance is the badge of all"
3191,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"our tribe; and then you have called me unbeliever, cut-throat dog, and"
3192,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"spit upon my Jewish garments, and spurned at me with your foot, as if"
3193,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"I was a cur. Well then, it now appears you need my help; and you come"
3194,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"to me, and say, _Shylock, lend me monies_. Has a dog money? Is it"
3195,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,possible a cur should lend three thousand ducats? Shall I bend low
3196,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and say, Fair sir, you spit upon me on Wednesday last, another time"
3197,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"you called me dog, and for these courtesies I am to lend you monies."""
3198,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Anthonio replied, ""I am as like to call you so again, to spit on you"
3199,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"again, and spurn you too. If you will lend me this money, lend it not"
3200,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"to me as to a friend, but rather lend it to me as to an enemy, that,"
3201,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"if I break, you may with better face exact the penalty.""--""Why, look"
3202,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"you,"" said Shylock, ""how you storm! I would be friends with you, and"
3203,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,have your love. I will forget the shames you have put upon me. I will
3204,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"supply your wants, and take no interest for my money."" This seemingly"
3205,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,kind offer greatly surprised Anthonio; and then Shylock still
3206,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"pretending kindness, and that all he did was to gain Anthonio's love,"
3207,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"again said he would lend him the three thousand ducats, and take no"
3208,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"interest for his money; only Anthonio should go with him to a lawyer,"
3209,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and there sign in merry sport a bond, that if he did not repay the"
3210,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"money by a certain day, he would forfeit a pound of flesh, to be cut"
3211,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,off from any part of his body that Shylock pleased.
3212,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3213,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""Content,"" said Anthonio: ""I will sign to this bond, and say there is"
3214,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"much kindness in the Jew."""
3215,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3216,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Bassanio said Anthonio should not sign to such a bond for him; but
3217,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"still Anthonio insisted that he would sign it, for that before the"
3218,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"day of payment came, his ships would return laden with many times the"
3219,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,value of the money.
3220,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3221,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Shylock, hearing this debate, exclaimed, ""O father Abraham, what"
3222,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,suspicious people these Christians are! Their own hard dealings teach
3223,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"them to suspect the thoughts of others. I pray you tell me this,"
3224,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Bassanio: if he should break this day, what should I gain by the"
3225,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"exaction of the forfeiture? A pound of man's flesh, taken from a man,"
3226,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"is not so estimable, nor profitable neither, as the flesh of mutton or"
3227,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"of beef. I say, to buy his favour I offer this friendship: if he will"
3228,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"take it, so; if not, adieu."""
3229,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3230,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"At last, against the advice of Bassanio, who, notwithstanding all the"
3231,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Jew had said of his kind intentions, did not like his friend should"
3232,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"run the hazard of this shocking penalty for his sake, Anthonio signed"
3233,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"the bond, thinking it really was (as the Jew said) merely in sport."
3234,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3235,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"The rich heiress that Bassanio wished to marry lived near Venice, at"
3236,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"a place called Belmont: her name was Portia, and in the graces of her"
3237,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"person and her mind she was nothing inferior to that Portia, of whom"
3238,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"we read, who was Cato's daughter, and the wife of Brutus."
3239,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3240,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Bassanio, being so kindly supplied with money by his friend Anthonio"
3241,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"at the hazard of his life, set out for Belmont with a splendid train,"
3242,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,and attended by a gentleman of the name of Gratiano.
3243,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3244,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Bassanio proving successful in his suit, Portia in a short time"
3245,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,consented to accept of him for a husband.
3246,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3247,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Bassanio confessed to Portia that he had no fortune, and that his"
3248,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"high birth and noble ancestry was all that he could boast of; she,"
3249,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"who loved him for his worthy qualities, and had riches enough not to"
3250,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"regard wealth in a husband, answered with a graceful modesty, that she"
3251,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"would wish herself a thousand times more fair, and ten thousand times"
3252,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"more rich, to be more worthy of him; and then the accomplished Portia"
3253,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"prettily dispraised herself, and said she was an unlessoned girl,"
3254,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"unschooled, unpractised, yet not so old but that she could learn, and"
3255,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,that she would commit her gentle spirit to be directed and governed
3256,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"by him in all things; and she said, ""Myself, and what is mine, to you"
3257,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and yours is now converted. But yesterday, Bassanio, I was the lady of"
3258,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"this fair mansion, queen of myself, and mistress over these servants;"
3259,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and now this house, these servants, and myself, are yours, my lord; I"
3260,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"give them with this ring:"" presenting a ring to Bassanio."
3261,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3262,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Bassanio was so overpowered with gratitude and wonder at the gracious
3263,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,manner in which the rich and noble Portia accepted of a man of his
3264,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"humble fortunes, that he could not express his joy and reverence to"
3265,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,the dear lady who so honoured him by any thing but broken words of
3266,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"love and thankfulness: and taking the ring, he vowed never to part"
3267,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,with it.
3268,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3269,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Gratiano, and Nerissa, Portia's waiting-maid, were in attendance upon"
3270,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"their lord and lady, when Portia so gracefully promised to become the"
3271,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"obedient wife of Bassanio; and Gratiano, wishing Bassanio and the"
3272,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"generous lady joy, desired permission to be married at the same time."
3273,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3274,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""With all my heart, Gratiano,"" said Bassanio, ""if you can get a wife."""
3275,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3276,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Gratiano then said that he loved the lady Portia's fair waiting
3277,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"gentlewoman, Nerissa, and that she had promised to be his wife, if her"
3278,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,lady married Bassanio. Portia asked Nerissa if this was true. Nerissa
3279,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"replied, ""Madam, it is so, if you approve of it."" Portia willingly"
3280,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"consenting, Bassanio pleasantly said, ""Then our wedding-feast shall be"
3281,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"much honoured by your marriage, Gratiano."""
3282,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3283,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,The happiness of these lovers was sadly crossed at this moment by the
3284,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"entrance of a messenger, who brought a letter from Anthonio containing"
3285,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"fearful tidings. When Bassanio read Anthonio's letter, Portia feared"
3286,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"it was to tell him of the death of some dear friend, he looked so"
3287,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"pale; and enquiring what was the news which had so distressed him, he"
3288,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"said, ""O sweet Portia, here are a few of the unpleasantest words that"
3289,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"ever blotted paper: gentle lady, when I first imparted my love to you,"
3290,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,I freely told you all the wealth I had ran in my veins; but I should
3291,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"have told you that I had less than nothing, being in debt."" Bassanio"
3292,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"then told Portia what has been here related, of his borrowing the"
3293,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"money of Anthonio, and of Anthonio's procuring it of Shylock the Jew,"
3294,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,and of the bond by which Anthonio had engaged to forfeit a pound of
3295,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"flesh, if it was not repaid by a certain day; and then Bassanio read"
3296,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Anthonio's letter, the words of which were, ""_Sweet Bassanio, my ships"
3297,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"are all lost, my bond to the Jew is forfeited, and since in paying it,"
3298,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"it is impossible I should live, I could wish to see you at my death;"
3299,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,notwithstanding use your pleasure; if your love for me do not persuade
3300,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"you to come, let not my letter._"" ""O my dear love,"" said Portia,"
3301,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""dispatch all business and be gone; you shall have gold to pay the"
3302,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"money twenty times over, before this kind friend shall lose a hair by"
3303,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"my Bassanio's fault; and as you are so dearly bought, I will dearly"
3304,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"love you."" Portia then said she would be married to Bassanio before"
3305,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"he set out, to give him a legal right to her money; and that same"
3306,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"day they were married, and Gratiano was also married to Nerissa; and"
3307,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Bassanio and Gratiano, the instant they were married, set out in great"
3308,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"haste for Venice, where Bassanio found Anthonio in prison."
3309,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3310,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"The day of payment being past, the cruel Jew would not accept of the"
3311,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"money which Bassanio offered him, but insisted upon having a pound"
3312,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,of Anthonio's flesh. A day was appointed to try this shocking cause
3313,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"before the Duke of Venice, and Bassanio awaited in dreadful suspence"
3314,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,the event of the trial.
3315,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3316,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"When Portia parted with her husband, she spoke cheeringly to him,"
3317,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,and bade him bring his dear friend along with him when he returned;
3318,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"yet she feared it would go hard with Anthonio, and when she was left"
3319,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"alone, she began to think and consider within herself, if she could by"
3320,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,any means be instrumental in saving the life of her dear Bassanio's
3321,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"friend; and notwithstanding, when she wished to honour her Bassanio,"
3322,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"she had said to him with such a meek and wife-like grace, that she"
3323,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"would submit in all things to be governed by his superior wisdom,"
3324,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,yet being now called forth into action by the peril of her honoured
3325,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"husband's friend, she did nothing doubt her own powers, and by the"
3326,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"sole guidance of her own true and perfect judgment, at once resolved"
3327,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"to go herself to Venice, and speak in Anthonio's defence."
3328,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3329,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Portia had a relation who was a counsellor in the law; to this
3330,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"gentleman, whose name was Bellario, she wrote, and stating the case to"
3331,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"him desired his opinion, and that with his advice he would also send"
3332,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"her the dress worn by a counsellor. When the messenger returned, he"
3333,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"brought letters from Bellario of advice how to proceed, and also every"
3334,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,thing necessary for her equipment.
3335,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3336,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Portia dressed herself and her maid Nerissa in men's apparel, and"
3337,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"putting on the robes of a counsellor, she took Nerissa along with her"
3338,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"as her clerk; and setting out immediately, they arrived at Venice on"
3339,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,the very day of the trial. The cause was just going to be heard before
3340,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"the duke and senators of Venice in the senate-house, when Portia"
3341,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"entered this high court of justice, and presented a letter from"
3342,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Bellario, in which that learned counsellor wrote to the duke, saying,"
3343,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"he would have come himself to plead for Anthonio, but that he was"
3344,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"prevented by sickness, and he requested that the learned young doctor"
3345,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Balthasar (so he called Portia) might be permitted to plead in
3346,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"his stead. This the duke granted, much wondering at the youthful"
3347,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"appearance of the stranger, who was prettily disguised by her"
3348,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,counsellor's robes and her large wig.
3349,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3350,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"And now began this important trial. Portia looked around her, and she"
3351,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"saw the merciless Jew; and she saw Bassanio, but he knew her not in"
3352,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"her disguise. He was standing beside Anthonio, in an agony of distress"
3353,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,and fear for his friend.
3354,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3355,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,The importance of the arduous task Portia had engaged in gave this
3356,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"tender lady courage, and she boldly proceeded in the duty she had"
3357,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,undertaken to perform; and first of all she addressed herself to
3358,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Shylock; and allowing that he had a right by the Venetian law to have
3359,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"the forfeit expressed in the bond, she spoke so sweetly of the noble"
3360,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"quality of _mercy_, as would have softened any heart but the unfeeling"
3361,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Shylock's; saying, that it dropped as the gentle rain from heaven upon"
3362,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"the place beneath; and how mercy was a double blessing, it blessed him"
3363,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"that gave, and him that received it; and how it became monarchs better"
3364,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"than their crowns, being an attribute of God himself; and that earthly"
3365,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"power came nearest to God's, in proportion as mercy tempered justice:"
3366,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and she bid Shylock remember that as we all pray for mercy, that"
3367,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,same prayer should teach us to show mercy. Shylock only answered
3368,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"her by desiring to have the penalty forfeited in the bond. ""Is he"
3369,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"not able to pay the money?"" asked Portia. Bassanio then offered the"
3370,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Jew the payment of the three thousand ducats, as many times over as"
3371,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"he should desire; which Shylock refusing, and still insisting upon"
3372,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"having a pound of Anthonio's flesh, Bassanio begged the learned"
3373,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"young counsellor would endeavour to wrest the law a little, to"
3374,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"save Anthonio's life. But Portia gravely answered, that laws once"
3375,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,established must never be altered. Shylock hearing Portia say that the
3376,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"law might not be altered, it seemed to him that she was pleading in"
3377,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"his favour, and he said, ""A Daniel has come to judgment! O wise young"
3378,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"judge, how I do honour you! How much elder are you than your looks!"""
3379,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3380,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Portia now desired Shylock to let her look at the bond; and when she
3381,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"had read it, she said, ""This bond is forfeited, and by this the Jew"
3382,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"may lawfully claim a pound of flesh, to be by him cut off nearest"
3383,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Anthonio's heart."" Then she said to Shylock, ""Be merciful; take the"
3384,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"money, and bid me tear the bond."" But no mercy would the cruel Shylock"
3385,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"shew; and he said, ""By my soul I swear, there is no power in the"
3386,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"tongue of man to alter me.""--""Why then, Anthonio,"" said Portia,"
3387,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""you must prepare your bosom for the knife:"" and while Shylock was"
3388,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,sharpening a long knife with great eagerness to cut off the pound of
3389,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"flesh, Portia said to Anthonio, ""Have you any thing to say?"" Anthonio"
3390,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"with a calm resignation replied, that he had but little to say, for"
3391,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"that he had prepared his mind for death. Then he said to Bassanio,"
3392,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""Give me your hand, Bassanio! Fare you well! Grieve not that I am"
3393,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,fallen into this misfortune for you. Commend me to your honourable
3394,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"wife, and tell her how I have loved you!"" Bassanio in the deepest"
3395,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"affliction replied, ""Anthonio, I am married to a wife, who is as dear"
3396,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"to me as life itself; but life itself, my wife, and all the world,"
3397,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"are not esteemed with me above your life: I would lose all, I would"
3398,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"sacrifice all to this devil here, to deliver you."""
3399,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3400,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Portia hearing this, though the kind-hearted lady was not at all"
3401,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,offended with her husband for expressing the love he owed to so
3402,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"true a friend as Anthonio in these strong terms, yet could not help"
3403,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"answering, ""Your wife would give you little thanks, if she were"
3404,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"present, to hear you make this offer."" And then Gratiano, who loved to"
3405,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"copy what his lord did, thought he must make a speech like Bassanio's,"
3406,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and he said, in Nerissa's hearing, who was writing in her clerk's"
3407,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"dress by the side of Portia, ""I have a wife, whom I protest I love;"
3408,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"I wish she were in heaven, if she could but entreat some power there"
3409,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"to change the cruel temper of this currish Jew."" ""It is well you wish"
3410,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"this behind her back, else you would have but an unquiet house,"" said"
3411,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Nerissa.
3412,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3413,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Shylock now cried out impatiently, ""We trifle time; I pray pronounce"
3414,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"the sentence."" And now all was awful expectation in the court, and"
3415,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,every heart was full of grief for Anthonio.
3416,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3417,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Portia asked if the scales were ready to weigh the flesh; and she said
3418,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"to the Jew, ""Shylock, you must have some surgeon by, lest he bleed to"
3419,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"death."" Shylock, whose whole intent was that Anthonio should bleed to"
3420,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"death, said, ""It is not so named in the bond."" Portia replied, ""It is"
3421,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"not so named in the bond, but what of that? It were good you did so"
3422,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"much for charity."" To this all the answer Shylock would make was, ""I"
3423,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"cannot find it; it is not in the bond."" ""Then,"" said Portia, ""a pound"
3424,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"of Anthonio's flesh is thine. The law allows it, and the court awards"
3425,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"it. And you may cut this flesh from off his breast. The law allows it,"
3426,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and the court awards it."" Again Shylock exclaimed, ""O wise and upright"
3427,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"judge! A Daniel has come to judgment!"" And then he sharpened his"
3428,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"long knife again, and looking eagerly on Anthonio, he said, ""Come,"
3429,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"prepare!"""
3430,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3431,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""Tarry a little, Jew,"" said Portia; ""there is something else. This"
3432,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"bond here gives you no drop of blood; the words expressly are, a"
3433,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,pound of flesh. If in the cutting off the pound of flesh you shed one
3434,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"drop of Christian blood, your land and goods are by the law to be"
3435,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"confiscated to the state of Venice."" Now as it was utterly impossible"
3436,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,for Shylock to cut off the pound of flesh without shedding some of
3437,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Anthonio's blood, this wise discovery of Portia's, that it was flesh"
3438,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and not blood that was named in the bond, saved the life of Anthonio;"
3439,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and all admiring the wonderful sagacity of the young counsellor, who"
3440,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"had so happily thought of this expedient, plaudits resounded from"
3441,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"every part of the senate-house; and Gratiano exclaimed, in the words"
3442,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"which Shylock had used, ""O wise and upright judge! mark, Jew, a Daniel"
3443,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"is come to judgment!"""
3444,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3445,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Shylock finding himself defeated in his cruel intent, said with"
3446,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"a disappointed look, that he would take the money; and Bassanio,"
3447,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"rejoiced beyond measure at Anthonio's unexpected deliverance, cried"
3448,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"out, ""Here is the money!"" But Portia stopped him, saying, ""Softly;"
3449,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,there is no haste; the Jew shall have nothing but the penalty:
3450,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"therefore prepare, Shylock, to cut off the flesh; but mind you shed no"
3451,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,blood; nor do not cut off more nor less than just a pound; be it more
3452,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"or less by one poor scruple, nay if the scale turn but by the weight"
3453,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"of a single hair, you are condemned by the laws of Venice to die, and"
3454,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"all your wealth is forfeited to the senate."" ""Give me my money, and"
3455,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"let me go,"" said Shylock. ""I have it ready,"" said Bassanio: ""Here it"
3456,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"is."""
3457,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3458,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Shylock was going to take the money, when Portia again stopped him,"
3459,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"saying, ""Tarry, Jew; I have yet another hold upon you. By the laws of"
3460,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Venice your wealth is forfeited to the state, for having conspired"
3461,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"against the life of one of its citizens, and your life lies at the"
3462,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"mercy of the duke; therefore down on your knees, and ask him to pardon"
3463,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"you."""
3464,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3465,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"The duke then said to Shylock, ""That you may see the difference of our"
3466,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Christian spirit, I pardon you your life before you ask it; half your"
3467,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"wealth belongs to Anthonio, the other half comes to the state."""
3468,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3469,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"The generous Anthonio then said, that he would give up his share of"
3470,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Shylock's wealth, if Shylock would sign a deed to make it over at his"
3471,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,death to his daughter and her husband; for Anthonio knew that the Jew
3472,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"had an only daughter, who had lately married against his consent to a"
3473,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"young Christian, named Lorenzo, a friend of Anthonio's, which had so"
3474,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"offended Shylock, that he had disinherited her."
3475,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3476,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"The Jew agreed to this; and being thus disappointed in his revenge,"
3477,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and despoiled of his riches, he said, ""I am ill. Let me go home;"
3478,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"send the deed after me, and I will sign over half my riches to my"
3479,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"daughter."" ""Get thee gone, then,"" said the duke, ""and sign it; and if"
3480,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"you repent your cruelty and turn Christian, the state will forgive you"
3481,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"the fine of the other half of your riches."""
3482,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3483,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"The duke now released Anthonio, and dismissed the court. He then"
3484,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"highly praised the wisdom and ingenuity of the young counsellor, and"
3485,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"invited him home to dinner. Portia, who meant to return to Belmont"
3486,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"before her husband, replied, ""I humbly thank your grace, but I must"
3487,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"away directly."" The duke said he was sorry he had not leisure to stay"
3488,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and dine with him; and turning to Anthonio, he added, ""Reward this"
3489,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"gentleman; for in my mind you are much indebted to him."""
3490,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3491,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,The duke and his senators left the court; and then Bassanio said to
3492,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Portia, ""Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend Anthonio have by your"
3493,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"wisdom been this day acquitted of grievous penalties, and I beg you"
3494,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"will accept of the three thousand ducats due unto the Jew."" ""And we"
3495,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"shall stand indebted to you over and above,"" said Anthonio, ""in love"
3496,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and service evermore."""
3497,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3498,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Portia could not be prevailed upon to accept the money; but upon
3499,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Bassanio still pressing her to accept of some reward, she said, ""Give"
3500,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"me your gloves; I will wear them for your sake:"" and then Bassanio"
3501,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"taking off his gloves, she espied the ring which she had given him"
3502,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,upon his finger: now it was the ring the wily lady wanted to get from
3503,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"him to make a merry jest when she saw her Bassanio again, that made"
3504,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"her ask him for his gloves; and she said, when she saw the ring, ""And"
3505,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"for your love I will take this ring from you."" Bassanio was sadly"
3506,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"distressed, that the counsellor should ask him for the only thing he"
3507,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"could not part with, and he replied in great confusion, that he could"
3508,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"not give him that ring, because it was his wife's gift, and he had"
3509,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,vowed never to part with it: but that he would give him the most
3510,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"valuable ring in Venice, and find it out by proclamation. On this"
3511,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Portia affected to be affronted, and left the court, saying, ""You"
3512,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"teach me, sir, how a beggar should be answered."""
3513,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3514,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""Dear Bassanio,"" said Anthonio, ""let him have the ring; let my love"
3515,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,and the great service he has done for me be valued against your wife's
3516,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"displeasure."" Bassanio, ashamed to appear so ungrateful, yielded,"
3517,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,and sent Gratiano after Portia with the ring; and then the _clerk_
3518,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Nerissa, who had also given Gratiano a ring, she begged his ring, and"
3519,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Gratiano (not choosing to be outdone in generosity by his lord) gave
3520,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"it to her. And there was laughing among these ladies to think, when"
3521,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"they got home, how they would tax their husbands with giving away"
3522,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"their rings, and swear that they had given them as a present to some"
3523,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,woman.
3524,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3525,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Portia, when she returned, was in that happy temper of mind which"
3526,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,never fails to attend the consciousness of having performed a good
3527,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,action; her cheerful spirits enjoyed every thing she saw: the moon
3528,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,never seemed to shine so bright before; and when that pleasant moon
3529,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"was hid behind a cloud, then a light which she saw from her house at"
3530,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Belmont as well pleased her charmed fancy, and she said to Nerissa,"
3531,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""That light we see is burning in my hall; how far that little candle"
3532,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"throws its beams, so shines a good deed in a naughty world:"" and"
3533,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"hearing the sound of music from her house, she said, ""Methinks that"
3534,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"music sounds much sweeter than by day."""
3535,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3536,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"And now Portia and Nerissa entered the house, and dressing themselves"
3537,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"in their own apparel, they awaited the arrival of their husbands, who"
3538,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,soon followed them with Anthonio; and Bassanio presenting his dear
3539,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"friend to the lady Portia, the congratulations and welcomings of that"
3540,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"lady were hardly over, when they perceived Nerissa and her husband"
3541,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"quarrelling in a corner of the room. ""A quarrel already?"" said Portia."
3542,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""What is the matter?"" Gratiano replied, ""Lady, it is about a paltry"
3543,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"gilt ring that Nerissa gave me, with words upon it like the poetry on"
3544,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"a cutler's knife; _Love me, and leave me not_."""
3545,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3546,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""What does the poetry or the value of the ring signify?"" said Nerissa."
3547,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""You swore to me, when I gave it to you, that you would keep it till"
3548,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,the hour of death; and now you say you gave it to the lawyer's clerk.
3549,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"I know you gave it to a woman."" ""By this hand,"" replied Gratiano, ""I"
3550,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"gave it to a youth, a kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy no higher"
3551,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,than yourself; he was clerk to the young counsellor that by his wise
3552,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"pleading saved Anthonio's life: this prating boy begged it for a fee,"
3553,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"and I could not for my life deny him."" Portia said, ""You were to"
3554,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"blame, Gratiano, to part with your wife's first gift. I gave my lord"
3555,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Bassanio a ring, and I am sure he would not part with it for all the"
3556,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"world."" Gratiano in excuse for his fault now said, ""My lord Bassanio"
3557,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"gave his ring away to the counsellor, and then the boy, his clerk,"
3558,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"that took some pains in writing, he begged my ring."""
3559,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3560,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Portia, hearing this, seemed very angry, and reproached Bassanio for"
3561,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"giving away her ring; and she said, Nerissa had taught her what to"
3562,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"believe, and that she knew some woman had the ring. Bassanio was very"
3563,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"unhappy to have so offended his dear lady, and he said with great"
3564,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"earnestness, ""No, by my honour, no woman had it, but a civil doctor,"
3565,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"who refused three thousand ducats of me, and begged the ring, which"
3566,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"when I denied him, he went displeased away. What could I do, sweet"
3567,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Portia? I was so beset with shame for my seeming ingratitude, that I"
3568,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"was forced to send the ring after him. Pardon me, good lady; had you"
3569,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"been there, I think you would have begged the ring of me to give the"
3570,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"worthy doctor."""
3571,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3572,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"""Ah!"" said Anthonio, ""I am the unhappy cause of these quarrels."""
3573,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3574,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Portia bid Anthonio not to grieve at that, for that he was welcome"
3575,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"notwithstanding; and then Anthonio said, ""I once did lend my body for"
3576,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,Bassanio's sake; and but for him to whom your husband gave the ring
3577,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"I should have now been dead. I dare be bound again, my soul upon the"
3578,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"forfeit, your lord will never more break his faith with you."" ""Then"
3579,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"you shall be his surety,"" said Portia; ""give him this ring, and bid"
3580,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"him keep it better than the other."""
3581,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3582,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"When Bassanio looked at this ring, he was strangely surprised to find"
3583,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"it was the same he gave away; and then Portia told him, how she was"
3584,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"the young counsellor, and Nerissa was her clerk; and Bassanio found to"
3585,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"his unspeakable wonder and delight, that it was by the noble courage"
3586,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,and wisdom of his wife that Anthonio's life was saved.
3587,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3588,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"And Portia again welcomed Anthonio, and gave him letters which by"
3589,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"some chance had fallen into her hands, which contained an account of"
3590,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"Anthonio's ships, that were supposed lost, being safely arrived in the"
3591,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,harbour. So these tragical beginnings of this rich merchant's story
3592,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,were all forgotten in the unexpected good fortune which ensued; and
3593,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"there was leisure to laugh at the comical adventure of the rings,"
3594,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,and the husbands that did not know their own wives: Gratiano merrily
3595,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"swearing, in a sort of rhyming speech, that"
3596,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,
3597,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"--while he liv'd, he'd fear no other thing"
3598,THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,"So sore, as keeping safe Nerissa's ring."

3604,CYMBELINE,
3605,CYMBELINE,(_By Mary Lamb_)
3606,CYMBELINE,
3607,CYMBELINE,
3608,CYMBELINE,"During the time of Augustus Cæsar, emperor of Rome, there reigned"
3609,CYMBELINE,in England (which was then called Britain) a king whose name was
3610,CYMBELINE,Cymbeline.
3611,CYMBELINE,
3612,CYMBELINE,Cymbeline's first wife died when his three children (two sons and a
3613,CYMBELINE,"daughter) were very young. Imogen, the eldest of these children, was"
3614,CYMBELINE,brought up in her father's court; but by a strange chance the two sons
3615,CYMBELINE,"of Cymbeline were stolen out of their nursery, when the eldest was but"
3616,CYMBELINE,"three years of age, and the youngest quite an infant: and Cymbeline"
3617,CYMBELINE,"could never discover what was become of them, or by whom they were"
3618,CYMBELINE,conveyed away.
3619,CYMBELINE,
3620,CYMBELINE,"Cymbeline was twice married: his second wife was a wicked, plotting"
3621,CYMBELINE,"woman, and a cruel stepmother to Imogen, Cymbeline's daughter by his"
3622,CYMBELINE,first wife.
3623,CYMBELINE,
3624,CYMBELINE,"The queen, though she hated Imogen, yet wished her to marry a son of"
3625,CYMBELINE,her own by a former husband (she also having been twice married): for
3626,CYMBELINE,by this means she hoped upon the death of Cymbeline to place the crown
3627,CYMBELINE,"of Britain upon the head of her son Cloten; for she knew that, if the"
3628,CYMBELINE,"king's sons were not found, the princess Imogen must be the king's"
3629,CYMBELINE,"heir. But this design was prevented by Imogen herself, who married"
3630,CYMBELINE,without the consent or even knowledge of her father or the queen.
3631,CYMBELINE,
3632,CYMBELINE,Posthumus (for that was the name of Imogen's husband) was the best
3633,CYMBELINE,scholar and most accomplished gentleman of that age. His father died
3634,CYMBELINE,"fighting in the wars for Cymbeline, and soon after his birth his"
3635,CYMBELINE,mother died also for grief at the loss of her husband.
3636,CYMBELINE,
3637,CYMBELINE,"Cymbeline, pitying the helpless state of this orphan, took Posthumus"
3638,CYMBELINE,(Cymbeline having given him that name because he was born after his
3639,CYMBELINE,"father's death), and educated him in his own court."
3640,CYMBELINE,
3641,CYMBELINE,"Imogen and Posthumus were both taught by the same masters, and were"
3642,CYMBELINE,play-fellows from their infancy: they loved each other tenderly when
3643,CYMBELINE,"they were children, and their affection continuing to increase with"
3644,CYMBELINE,"their years, when they grew up they privately married."
3645,CYMBELINE,
3646,CYMBELINE,"The disappointed queen soon learnt this secret, for she kept spies"
3647,CYMBELINE,"constantly in watch upon the actions of her daughter-in-law, and she"
3648,CYMBELINE,immediately told the king of the marriage of Imogen with Posthumus.
3649,CYMBELINE,
3650,CYMBELINE,"Nothing could exceed the wrath of Cymbeline, when he heard that his"
3651,CYMBELINE,daughter had been so forgetful of her high dignity as to marry a
3652,CYMBELINE,"subject. He commanded Posthumus to leave Britain, and banished him"
3653,CYMBELINE,from his native country for ever.
3654,CYMBELINE,
3655,CYMBELINE,"The queen, who pretended to pity Imogen for the grief she suffered at"
3656,CYMBELINE,"losing her husband, offered to procure them a private meeting, before"
3657,CYMBELINE,"Posthumus set out on his journey to Rome, which place he had chosen"
3658,CYMBELINE,"for his residence in his banishment: this seeming kindness she shewed,"
3659,CYMBELINE,the better to succeed in her future designs in regard to her son
3660,CYMBELINE,"Cloten; for she meant to persuade Imogen, when her husband was gone,"
3661,CYMBELINE,"that her marriage was not lawful, being contracted without the consent"
3662,CYMBELINE,of the king.
3663,CYMBELINE,
3664,CYMBELINE,Imogen and Posthumus took a most affectionate leave of each other.
3665,CYMBELINE,"Imogen gave her husband a diamond ring which had been her mother's,"
3666,CYMBELINE,and Posthumus promised never to part with the ring; and he fastened a
3667,CYMBELINE,"bracelet on the arm of his wife, which he begged she would preserve"
3668,CYMBELINE,"with great care, as a token of his love: they then bid each other"
3669,CYMBELINE,farewel with many vows of everlasting love and fidelity.
3670,CYMBELINE,
3671,CYMBELINE,"Imogen remained a solitary and dejected lady in her father's court,"
3672,CYMBELINE,"and Posthumus arrived at Rome, the place of his banishment."
3673,CYMBELINE,
3674,CYMBELINE,Posthumus fell into company at Rome with some gay young men of
3675,CYMBELINE,"different nations, who were talking freely of ladies: each one"
3676,CYMBELINE,"praising the ladies of his own country, and his own mistress."
3677,CYMBELINE,"Posthumus, who had ever his own dear lady in his mind, affirmed that"
3678,CYMBELINE,"his wife, the fair Imogen, was the most virtuous, wise, and constant"
3679,CYMBELINE,lady in the world.
3680,CYMBELINE,
3681,CYMBELINE,"One of these gentlemen, whose name was Iachimo, being offended that"
3682,CYMBELINE,"a lady of Britain should be so praised above the Roman ladies, his"
3683,CYMBELINE,"countrywomen, provoked Posthumus by seeming to doubt the constancy of"
3684,CYMBELINE,"his so highly-praised wife; and at length, after much altercation,"
3685,CYMBELINE,"Posthumus consented to a proposal of Iachimo's, that he (Iachimo)"
3686,CYMBELINE,"should go to Britain, and endeavour to gain the love of the married"
3687,CYMBELINE,"Imogen. They then laid a wager, that if Iachimo did not succeed in"
3688,CYMBELINE,"this wicked design, he was to forfeit a large sum of money; but if"
3689,CYMBELINE,"he could win Imogen's favour, and prevail upon her to give him the"
3690,CYMBELINE,bracelet which Posthumus had so earnestly desired she would keep as
3691,CYMBELINE,"a token of his love, then the wager was to terminate with Posthumus"
3692,CYMBELINE,"giving to Iachimo the ring, which was Imogen's love-present when she"
3693,CYMBELINE,parted with her husband. Such firm faith had Posthumus in the fidelity
3694,CYMBELINE,"of Imogen, that he thought he ran no hazard in this trial of her"
3695,CYMBELINE,honour.
3696,CYMBELINE,
3697,CYMBELINE,"Iachimo, on his arrival in Britain, gained admittance and a courteous"
3698,CYMBELINE,"welcome from Imogen, as a friend of her husband; but when he began to"
3699,CYMBELINE,"make professions of love to her, she repulsed him with disdain, and"
3700,CYMBELINE,he soon found that he could have no hope of succeeding in his
3701,CYMBELINE,dishonourable design.
3702,CYMBELINE,
3703,CYMBELINE,The desire Iachimo had to win the wager made him now have recourse to
3704,CYMBELINE,"a stratagem to impose upon Posthumus, and for this purpose he bribed"
3705,CYMBELINE,"some of Imogen's attendants, and was by them conveyed into her"
3706,CYMBELINE,"bedchamber, concealed in a large trunk, where he remained shut up till"
3707,CYMBELINE,"Imogen was retired to rest, and had fallen asleep; and then getting"
3708,CYMBELINE,"out of the trunk, he examined the chamber with great attention, and"
3709,CYMBELINE,"wrote down every thing he saw there, and particularly noticed a mole"
3710,CYMBELINE,"which he observed upon Imogen's neck, and then softly unloosing the"
3711,CYMBELINE,"bracelet from her arm, which Posthumus had given to her, he retired"
3712,CYMBELINE,into the chest again; and the next day he set off for Rome with great
3713,CYMBELINE,"expedition, and boasted to Posthumus that Imogen had given him the"
3714,CYMBELINE,"bracelet, and likewise permitted him to pass a night in her chamber:"
3715,CYMBELINE,"and in this manner Iachimo told his false tale; ""Her bed-chamber,"""
3716,CYMBELINE,"said he, ""was hung with tapestry of silk and silver, the story was"
3717,CYMBELINE,"_the proud Cleopatra when she met her Anthony_, a piece of work most"
3718,CYMBELINE,"bravely wrought."""
3719,CYMBELINE,
3720,CYMBELINE,"""This is true,"" said Posthumus; ""but this you might have heard spoken"
3721,CYMBELINE,"of without seeing."""
3722,CYMBELINE,
3723,CYMBELINE,"""Then the chimney,"" said Iachimo, ""is south of the chamber, and"
3724,CYMBELINE,the chimney-piece is _Diana bathing_; never saw I figures livelier
3725,CYMBELINE,"expressed."""
3726,CYMBELINE,
3727,CYMBELINE,"""This is a thing you might have likewise heard,"" said Posthumus; ""for"
3728,CYMBELINE,"it is much talked of."""
3729,CYMBELINE,
3730,CYMBELINE,"Iachimo as accurately described the roof of the chamber, and added, ""I"
3731,CYMBELINE,"had almost forgot her andirons, they were _two winking Cupids_ made of"
3732,CYMBELINE,"silver, each on one foot standing."" He then took out the bracelet, and"
3733,CYMBELINE,"said, ""Know you this jewel, sir? She gave me this. She took it from"
3734,CYMBELINE,"her arm. I see her yet; her pretty action did out-sell her gift, and"
3735,CYMBELINE,"yet enriched it too. She gave it me, and said, _she prized it once_."""
3736,CYMBELINE,He last of all described the mole he had observed upon her neck.
3737,CYMBELINE,
3738,CYMBELINE,"Posthumus, who had heard the whole of this artful recital in an agony"
3739,CYMBELINE,"of doubt, now broke out into the most passionate exclamations against"
3740,CYMBELINE,"Imogen. He delivered up the diamond ring to Iachimo, which he had"
3741,CYMBELINE,"agreed to forfeit to him, if he obtained the bracelet from Imogen."
3742,CYMBELINE,
3743,CYMBELINE,"Posthumus then in a jealous rage wrote to Pisanio, a gentleman of"
3744,CYMBELINE,"Britain, who was one of Imogen's attendants, and had long been a"
3745,CYMBELINE,faithful friend to Posthumus; and after telling him what proof he had
3746,CYMBELINE,"of his wife's disloyalty, he desired Pisanio would take Imogen to"
3747,CYMBELINE,"Milford-Haven, a seaport of Wales, and there kill her. And at the same"
3748,CYMBELINE,"time he wrote a deceitful letter to Imogen, desiring her to go with"
3749,CYMBELINE,"Pisanio, for that finding he could live no longer without seeing her,"
3750,CYMBELINE,"though he was forbidden upon pain of death to return to Britain,"
3751,CYMBELINE,"he would come to Milford-Haven, at which place he begged she would"
3752,CYMBELINE,"meet him. She, good unsuspecting lady, who loved her husband above"
3753,CYMBELINE,"all things, and desired more than her life to see him, hastened her"
3754,CYMBELINE,"departure with Pisanio, and the same night she received the letter she"
3755,CYMBELINE,set out.
3756,CYMBELINE,
3757,CYMBELINE,"When their journey was nearly at an end, Pisanio, who, though faithful"
3758,CYMBELINE,"to Posthumus, was not faithful to serve him in an evil deed, disclosed"
3759,CYMBELINE,to Imogen the cruel order he had received.
3760,CYMBELINE,
3761,CYMBELINE,"Imogen, who, instead of meeting a loving and beloved husband, found"
3762,CYMBELINE,"herself doomed by that husband to suffer death, was afflicted beyond"
3763,CYMBELINE,measure.
3764,CYMBELINE,
3765,CYMBELINE,"Pisanio persuaded her to take comfort, and wait with patient fortitude"
3766,CYMBELINE,for the time when Posthumus should see and repent his injustice:
3767,CYMBELINE,"in the mean time, as she refused in her distress to return to her"
3768,CYMBELINE,"father's court, he advised her to dress herself in boy's clothes for"
3769,CYMBELINE,"more security in travelling; to which advice she agreed, and thought"
3770,CYMBELINE,"in that disguise she would go over to Rome, and see her husband, whom,"
3771,CYMBELINE,"though he had used her so barbarously, she could not forget to love."
3772,CYMBELINE,"When Pisanio had provided her with her new apparel, he left her to her"
3773,CYMBELINE,"uncertain fortune, being obliged to return to court; but before he"
3774,CYMBELINE,"departed he gave her a phial of cordial, which he said the queen had"
3775,CYMBELINE,given him as a sovereign remedy in all disorders.
3776,CYMBELINE,
3777,CYMBELINE,"The queen, who hated Pisanio because he was a friend to Imogen and"
3778,CYMBELINE,"Posthumus, gave him this phial which she supposed contained poison,"
3779,CYMBELINE,"she having ordered her physician to give her some poison, to try its"
3780,CYMBELINE,"effects (as she said) upon animals: but the physician, knowing her"
3781,CYMBELINE,"malicious disposition, would not trust her with real poison, but gave"
3782,CYMBELINE,her a drug which would do no other mischief than causing a person to
3783,CYMBELINE,"sleep with every appearance of death for a few hours. This mixture,"
3784,CYMBELINE,"which Pisanio thought a choice cordial, he gave to Imogen, desiring"
3785,CYMBELINE,"her, if she found herself ill upon the road, to take it; and so with"
3786,CYMBELINE,blessings and prayers for her safety and happy deliverance from her
3787,CYMBELINE,undeserved troubles he left her.
3788,CYMBELINE,
3789,CYMBELINE,Providence strangely directed Imogen's steps to the dwelling of her
3790,CYMBELINE,"two brothers, who had been stolen away in their infancy. Bellarius,"
3791,CYMBELINE,"who stole them away, was a lord in the court of Cymbeline, and having"
3792,CYMBELINE,"been falsely accused to the king of treason, and banished from the"
3793,CYMBELINE,"court, in revenge he stole away the two sons of Cymbeline, and brought"
3794,CYMBELINE,"them up in a forest, where he lived concealed in a cave. He stole them"
3795,CYMBELINE,"through revenge, but he soon loved them as tenderly as if they had"
3796,CYMBELINE,"been his own children, educated them carefully, and they grew up"
3797,CYMBELINE,"fine youths, their princely spirits leading them to bold and daring"
3798,CYMBELINE,"actions; and as they subsisted by hunting, they were active and hardy,"
3799,CYMBELINE,and were always pressing their supposed father to let them seek their
3800,CYMBELINE,fortune in the wars.
3801,CYMBELINE,
3802,CYMBELINE,At the cave where these youths dwelt it was Imogen's fortune to
3803,CYMBELINE,"arrive. She had lost her way in a large forest, through which her road"
3804,CYMBELINE,lay to Milford-Haven (from whence she meant to embark for Rome); and
3805,CYMBELINE,"being unable to find any place where she could purchase food, she was"
3806,CYMBELINE,with weariness and hunger almost dying; for it is not merely putting
3807,CYMBELINE,"on a man's apparel that will enable a young lady, tenderly brought"
3808,CYMBELINE,"up, to bear the fatigue of wandering about lonely forests like a man."
3809,CYMBELINE,"Seeing this cave she entered, hoping to find some one within of whom"
3810,CYMBELINE,"she could procure food. She found the cave empty, but looking about"
3811,CYMBELINE,"she discovered some cold meat, and her hunger was so pressing, that"
3812,CYMBELINE,"she could not wait for an invitation, but sat down, and began to eat."
3813,CYMBELINE,"""Ah!"" said she, talking to herself; ""I see a man's life is a tedious"
3814,CYMBELINE,one: how tired am I! for two nights together I have made the ground my
3815,CYMBELINE,"bed: my resolution helps me, or I should be sick. When Pisanio shewed"
3816,CYMBELINE,"me Milford-Haven from the mountain-top, how near it seemed!"" Then the"
3817,CYMBELINE,"thoughts of her husband and his cruel mandate came across her, and she"
3818,CYMBELINE,"said, ""My dear Posthumus, thou art a false one!"""
3819,CYMBELINE,
3820,CYMBELINE,"The two brothers of Imogen, who had been hunting with their reputed"
3821,CYMBELINE,"father Bellarius, were by this time returned home. Bellarius had given"
3822,CYMBELINE,"them the names of Polidore and Cadwal, and they knew no better, but"
3823,CYMBELINE,supposed that Bellarius was their father: but the real names of these
3824,CYMBELINE,princes were Guiderius and Arviragus.
3825,CYMBELINE,
3826,CYMBELINE,"Bellarius entered the cave first, and seeing Imogen, stopped them,"
3827,CYMBELINE,"saying, ""Come not in yet; it eats our victuals, or I should think it"
3828,CYMBELINE,"was a fairy."""
3829,CYMBELINE,
3830,CYMBELINE,"""What is the matter, sir?"" said the young men. ""By Jupiter,"" said"
3831,CYMBELINE,"Bellarius again, ""there is an angel in the cave, or if not, an earthly"
3832,CYMBELINE,"paragon."" So beautiful did Imogen look in her boy's apparel."
3833,CYMBELINE,
3834,CYMBELINE,"She, hearing the sound of voices, came forth from the cave, and"
3835,CYMBELINE,"addressed them in these words: ""Good masters, do not harm me; before"
3836,CYMBELINE,"I entered your cave, I had thought to have begged or bought what I"
3837,CYMBELINE,"have eaten. Indeed I have stolen nothing, nor would I, though I had"
3838,CYMBELINE,"found gold strewn on the floor. Here is money for my meat, which I"
3839,CYMBELINE,"would have left on the board when I had made my meal, and parted"
3840,CYMBELINE,"with prayers for the provider."" They refused her money with great"
3841,CYMBELINE,"earnestness. ""I see you are angry with me,"" said the timid Imogen:"
3842,CYMBELINE,"""but, sirs, if you kill me for my fault, know that I should have died"
3843,CYMBELINE,"if I had not made it."""
3844,CYMBELINE,
3845,CYMBELINE,"""Whither are you bound?"" asked Bellarius, ""and what is your name?"""
3846,CYMBELINE,
3847,CYMBELINE,"""Fidele is my name,"" answered Imogen. ""I have a kinsman, who is bound"
3848,CYMBELINE,"for Italy; he embarked at Milford-Haven, to whom being going, almost"
3849,CYMBELINE,"spent with hunger, I am fallen into this offence."""
3850,CYMBELINE,
3851,CYMBELINE,"""Prithee, fair youth,"" said old Bellarius, ""do not think us churls,"
3852,CYMBELINE,nor measure our good minds by this rude place we live in. You are well
3853,CYMBELINE,encountered; it is almost night. You shall have better cheer before
3854,CYMBELINE,"you depart, and thanks to stay and eat it. Boys, bid him welcome."""
3855,CYMBELINE,
3856,CYMBELINE,"The gentle youths, her brothers, then welcomed Imogen to their cave"
3857,CYMBELINE,"with many kind expressions, saying they would love her (or, as they"
3858,CYMBELINE,"said, _him_) as a brother; and they entered the cave, where (they"
3859,CYMBELINE,having killed venison when they were hunting) Imogen delighted them
3860,CYMBELINE,"with her neat housewifery, assisting them in preparing their supper;"
3861,CYMBELINE,for though it is not the custom now for young women of high birth to
3862,CYMBELINE,"understand cookery, it was then, and Imogen excelled in this useful"
3863,CYMBELINE,"art; and, as her brothers prettily expressed it, Fidele cut their"
3864,CYMBELINE,"roots in characters, and sauced their broth, as if Juno had been sick,"
3865,CYMBELINE,"and Fidele were her dieter. ""And then,"" said Polidore to his brother,"
3866,CYMBELINE,"""how angel-like he sings!"""
3867,CYMBELINE,
3868,CYMBELINE,"They also remarked to each other, that though Fidele smiled so"
3869,CYMBELINE,"sweetly, yet so sad a melancholy did overcloud his lovely face, as if"
3870,CYMBELINE,grief and patience had together taken possession of him.
3871,CYMBELINE,
3872,CYMBELINE,For these her gentle qualities (or perhaps it was their near
3873,CYMBELINE,"relationship, though they knew it not) Imogen (or, as the boys called"
3874,CYMBELINE,"her, _Fidele_) became the doating-piece of her brothers, and she"
3875,CYMBELINE,"scarcely less loved them, thinking that but for the memory of her"
3876,CYMBELINE,"dear Posthumus, she could live and die in the cave with these wild"
3877,CYMBELINE,"forest-youths; and she gladly consented to stay with them, till she"
3878,CYMBELINE,was enough rested from the fatigue of travelling to pursue her way
3879,CYMBELINE,"to Milford-Haven. When the venison they had taken was all eaten, and"
3880,CYMBELINE,"they were going out to hunt for more, Fidele could not accompany them"
3881,CYMBELINE,"because she was unwell. Sorrow, no doubt, for her husband's cruel"
3882,CYMBELINE,"usage, as well as the fatigue of wandering in the forest, was the"
3883,CYMBELINE,cause of her illness.
3884,CYMBELINE,
3885,CYMBELINE,"They then bid her farewel, and went to their hunt, praising all the"
3886,CYMBELINE,way the noble parts and graceful demeanour of the youth Fidele.
3887,CYMBELINE,
3888,CYMBELINE,Imogen was no sooner left alone than she recollected the cordial
3889,CYMBELINE,"Pisanio had given her, and drank it off, and presently fell into a"
3890,CYMBELINE,sound and death-like sleep.
3891,CYMBELINE,
3892,CYMBELINE,"When Bellarius and her brothers returned from hunting, Polidore went"
3893,CYMBELINE,"first into the cave, and supposing her asleep, pulled off his heavy"
3894,CYMBELINE,"shoes, that he might tread softly and not awake her; so did true"
3895,CYMBELINE,gentleness spring up in the minds of these princely foresters: but
3896,CYMBELINE,"he soon discovered that she could not be awakened by any noise, and"
3897,CYMBELINE,"concluded her to be dead, and Polidore lamented over her with dear and"
3898,CYMBELINE,"brotherly regret, as if they had never from their infancy been parted."
3899,CYMBELINE,
3900,CYMBELINE,"Bellarius also proposed to carry her out into the forest, and there"
3901,CYMBELINE,"celebrate her funeral with songs and solemn dirges, as was then the"
3902,CYMBELINE,custom.
3903,CYMBELINE,
3904,CYMBELINE,"Imogen's two brothers then carried her to a shady covert, and there"
3905,CYMBELINE,"laying her gently on the grass, they sang repose to her departed"
3906,CYMBELINE,"spirit, and covering her over with leaves and flowers, Polidore said,"
3907,CYMBELINE,"""While summer lasts and I live here, Fidele, I will daily strew thy"
3908,CYMBELINE,"sad grave. The pale primrose, that flower most like thy face; the"
3909,CYMBELINE,"blue-bell, like thy clear veins; and the leaf of eglantine, which is"
3910,CYMBELINE,not sweeter than was thy breath; all these I will strew over thee.
3911,CYMBELINE,"Yea, and the furred moss in winter, when there are no flowers to cover"
3912,CYMBELINE,"thy sweet corse."""
3913,CYMBELINE,
3914,CYMBELINE,"When they had finished her funeral obsequies, they departed very"
3915,CYMBELINE,sorrowful.
3916,CYMBELINE,
3917,CYMBELINE,"Imogen had not been long left alone, when, the effect of the sleepy"
3918,CYMBELINE,"drug going off, she awaked, and easily shaking off the slight"
3919,CYMBELINE,"covering of leaves and flowers they had thrown over her, she arose,"
3920,CYMBELINE,"and imagining she had been dreaming, she said, ""I thought I was a"
3921,CYMBELINE,"cave-keeper, and cook to honest creatures; how came I here, covered"
3922,CYMBELINE,"with flowers?"" Not being able to find her way back to the cave, and"
3923,CYMBELINE,"seeing nothing of her new companions, she concluded it was certainly"
3924,CYMBELINE,"all a dream; and once more Imogen set out on her weary pilgrimage,"
3925,CYMBELINE,"hoping at last she should find her way to Milford-Haven, and thence"
3926,CYMBELINE,get a passage in some ship bound for Italy; for all her thoughts were
3927,CYMBELINE,"still with her husband Posthumus, whom she intended to seek in the"
3928,CYMBELINE,disguise of a page.
3929,CYMBELINE,
3930,CYMBELINE,"But great events were happening at this time, of which Imogen knew"
3931,CYMBELINE,nothing; for a war had suddenly broken out between the Roman emperor
3932,CYMBELINE,"Augustus Cæsar, and Cymbeline the king of Britain: and a Roman army"
3933,CYMBELINE,"had landed to invade Britain, and was advanced into the very forest"
3934,CYMBELINE,over which Imogen was journeying. With this army came Posthumus.
3935,CYMBELINE,
3936,CYMBELINE,"Though Posthumus came over to Britain with the Roman army, he did not"
3937,CYMBELINE,"mean to fight on their side against his own countrymen, but intended"
3938,CYMBELINE,"to join the army of Britain, and fight in the cause of his king who"
3939,CYMBELINE,had banished him. He still believed Imogen false to him; yet the death
3940,CYMBELINE,"of her he had so fondly loved, and by his own orders too (Pisanio"
3941,CYMBELINE,"having written him a letter to say he had obeyed his command, and that"
3942,CYMBELINE,"Imogen was dead) sat heavy on his heart, and therefore he returned to"
3943,CYMBELINE,"Britain, desiring either to be slain in battle, or to be put to death"
3944,CYMBELINE,by Cymbeline for returning home from banishment.
3945,CYMBELINE,
3946,CYMBELINE,"Imogen, before she reached Milford-Haven, fell into the hands of the"
3947,CYMBELINE,"Roman army; and her presence and deportment recommending her, she was"
3948,CYMBELINE,"made a page to Lucius, the Roman general."
3949,CYMBELINE,
3950,CYMBELINE,"Cymbeline's army now advanced to meet the enemy, and when they entered"
3951,CYMBELINE,"this forest, Polidore and Cadwal joined the king's army. The young men"
3952,CYMBELINE,"were eager to engage in acts of valour, though they little thought"
3953,CYMBELINE,they were going to fight for their own royal father; and old Bellarius
3954,CYMBELINE,went with them to the battle. He had long since repented of the injury
3955,CYMBELINE,he had done to Cymbeline in carrying away his sons; and having been a
3956,CYMBELINE,"warrior in his youth, he gladly joined the army to fight for the king"
3957,CYMBELINE,he had so injured.
3958,CYMBELINE,
3959,CYMBELINE,"And now a great battle commenced between the two armies, and the"
3960,CYMBELINE,"Britons would have been defeated, and Cymbeline himself killed, but"
3961,CYMBELINE,"for the extraordinary valour of Posthumus, and Bellarius, and the two"
3962,CYMBELINE,"sons of Cymbeline. They rescued the king, and saved his life, and so"
3963,CYMBELINE,"entirely turned the fortune of the day, that the Britons gained the"
3964,CYMBELINE,victory.
3965,CYMBELINE,
3966,CYMBELINE,"When the battle was over, Posthumus, who had not found the death"
3967,CYMBELINE,"he sought for, surrendered himself up to one of the officers of"
3968,CYMBELINE,"Cymbeline, willing to suffer the death which was to be his punishment"
3969,CYMBELINE,if he returned from banishment.
3970,CYMBELINE,
3971,CYMBELINE,"Imogen and the master she served were taken prisoners, and brought"
3972,CYMBELINE,"before Cymbeline, as was also her old enemy Iachimo, who was an"
3973,CYMBELINE,officer in the Roman army; and when these prisoners were before the
3974,CYMBELINE,"king, Posthumus was brought in to receive his sentence of death; and"
3975,CYMBELINE,"at this strange juncture of time, Bellarius with Polidore and Cadwal"
3976,CYMBELINE,"were also brought before Cymbeline, to receive the rewards due to the"
3977,CYMBELINE,"great services they had by their valour done for the king. Pisanio,"
3978,CYMBELINE,"being one of the king's attendants, was likewise present."
3979,CYMBELINE,
3980,CYMBELINE,Therefore there were now standing in the king's presence (but with
3981,CYMBELINE,"very different hopes and fears) Posthumus, and Imogen, with her new"
3982,CYMBELINE,"master the Roman general; the faithful servant Pisanio, and the false"
3983,CYMBELINE,"friend Iachimo; and likewise the two lost sons of Cymbeline, with"
3984,CYMBELINE,Bellarius who had stolen them away.
3985,CYMBELINE,
3986,CYMBELINE,The Roman general was the first who spoke; the rest stood silent
3987,CYMBELINE,"before the king, though there was many a beating heart amongst them."
3988,CYMBELINE,
3989,CYMBELINE,"Imogen saw Posthumus and knew him, though he was in the disguise of"
3990,CYMBELINE,a peasant; but he did not know her in her male attire: and she knew
3991,CYMBELINE,"Iachimo, and she saw a ring on his finger which she perceived to be"
3992,CYMBELINE,"her own, but she did not know him as yet to have been the author of"
3993,CYMBELINE,all her troubles: and she stood before her own father a prisoner of
3994,CYMBELINE,war.
3995,CYMBELINE,
3996,CYMBELINE,"Pisanio knew Imogen, for it was he who had dressed her in the garb of"
3997,CYMBELINE,"a boy. ""It is my mistress,"" thought he; ""since she is living, let the"
3998,CYMBELINE,"time run on to good or bad."" Bellarius knew her too, and softly said"
3999,CYMBELINE,"to Cadwal, ""Is not this boy revived from death?"" ""One sand,"" replied"
4000,CYMBELINE,"Cadwal, ""does not more resemble another than that sweet rosy lad is"
4001,CYMBELINE,"like the dead Fidele."" ""The same dead thing alive,"" said Polidore."
4002,CYMBELINE,"""Peace, peace,"" said Bellarius; ""if it were he, I am sure he would"
4003,CYMBELINE,"have spoken to us."" ""But we saw him dead,"" again whispered Polidore."
4004,CYMBELINE,"""Be silent,"" replied Bellarius."
4005,CYMBELINE,
4006,CYMBELINE,Posthumus waited in silence to hear the welcome sentence of his own
4007,CYMBELINE,death; and he resolved not to disclose to the king that he had saved
4008,CYMBELINE,"his life in the battle, lest that should move Cymbeline to pardon him."
4009,CYMBELINE,
4010,CYMBELINE,"Lucius, the Roman general, who had taken Imogen under his protection"
4011,CYMBELINE,"as his page, was the first (as has been before said) who spoke to the"
4012,CYMBELINE,"king. He was a man of high courage and noble dignity, and this was his"
4013,CYMBELINE,speech to the king:
4014,CYMBELINE,
4015,CYMBELINE,"""I hear you take no ransom for your prisoners, but doom them all to"
4016,CYMBELINE,"death; I am a Roman, and with a Roman heart will suffer death. But"
4017,CYMBELINE,"there is one thing for which I would intreat."" Then bringing Imogen"
4018,CYMBELINE,"before the king, he said, ""This boy is a Briton born. Let him be"
4019,CYMBELINE,"ransomed. He is my page. Never master had a page so kind, so duteous,"
4020,CYMBELINE,"so diligent on all occasions, so true, so nurse-like. He hath done no"
4021,CYMBELINE,"Briton wrong, though he hath served a Roman. Save him, if you spare no"
4022,CYMBELINE,"one beside."""
4023,CYMBELINE,
4024,CYMBELINE,Cymbeline looked earnestly on his daughter Imogen. He knew her not in
4025,CYMBELINE,that disguise; but it seemed that all-powerful Nature spake in his
4026,CYMBELINE,"heart, for he said, ""I have surely seen him, his face appears familiar"
4027,CYMBELINE,"to me. I know not why or wherefore I say, Live, boy: but I give you"
4028,CYMBELINE,"your life, and ask of me what boon you will, and I will grant it you."
4029,CYMBELINE,"Yea, even though it be the life of the noblest prisoner I have."""
4030,CYMBELINE,
4031,CYMBELINE,"""I humbly thank your highness,"" said Imogen."
4032,CYMBELINE,
4033,CYMBELINE,What was then called granting a boon was the same as a promise to give
4034,CYMBELINE,"any one thing, whatever it might be, that the person on whom that"
4035,CYMBELINE,favour was conferred chose to ask for. They all were attentive to hear
4036,CYMBELINE,"what thing the page would ask for, and Lucius her master said to her,"
4037,CYMBELINE,"""I do not beg my life, good lad, but I know that is what you will ask"
4038,CYMBELINE,"for."" ""No, no, alas!"" said Imogen, ""I have other work in hand, good"
4039,CYMBELINE,"master; your life I cannot ask for."""
4040,CYMBELINE,
4041,CYMBELINE,This seeming want of gratitude in the boy astonished the Roman
4042,CYMBELINE,general.
4043,CYMBELINE,
4044,CYMBELINE,"Imogen then fixing her eye on Iachimo, demanded no other boon than"
4045,CYMBELINE,"this, that Iachimo should be made to confess whence he had the ring he"
4046,CYMBELINE,wore on his finger.
4047,CYMBELINE,
4048,CYMBELINE,"Cymbeline granted her this boon, and threatened Iachimo with the"
4049,CYMBELINE,torture if he did not confess how he came by the diamond ring on his
4050,CYMBELINE,finger.
4051,CYMBELINE,
4052,CYMBELINE,"Iachimo then made a full acknowledgment of all his villainy, telling,"
4053,CYMBELINE,"as has been before related, the whole story of his wager with"
4054,CYMBELINE,"Posthumus, and how he had succeeded in imposing upon his credulity."
4055,CYMBELINE,
4056,CYMBELINE,What Posthumus felt at hearing this proof of the innocence of his
4057,CYMBELINE,"lady cannot be expressed. He instantly came forward, and confessed to"
4058,CYMBELINE,Cymbeline the cruel sentence which he had enjoined Pisanio to execute
4059,CYMBELINE,"upon the princess: exclaiming wildly, ""O Imogen, my queen, my life, my"
4060,CYMBELINE,"wife! O Imogen, Imogen, Imogen!"""
4061,CYMBELINE,
4062,CYMBELINE,Imogen could not see her beloved husband in this distress without
4063,CYMBELINE,"discovering herself, to the unutterable joy of Posthumus, who was thus"
4064,CYMBELINE,"relieved from a weight of guilt and woe, and restored to the good"
4065,CYMBELINE,graces of the dear lady he had so cruelly treated.
4066,CYMBELINE,
4067,CYMBELINE,"Cymbeline, almost as much overwhelmed as he with joy, at finding his"
4068,CYMBELINE,"lost daughter so strangely recovered, received her to her former place"
4069,CYMBELINE,"in his fatherly affection, and not only gave her husband Posthumus his"
4070,CYMBELINE,"life, but consented to acknowledge him for his son-in-law."
4071,CYMBELINE,
4072,CYMBELINE,Bellarius chose this time of joy and reconciliation to make his
4073,CYMBELINE,"confession. He presented Polidore and Cadwal to the king, telling him"
4074,CYMBELINE,"they were his two lost sons, Guiderius and Arviragus."
4075,CYMBELINE,
4076,CYMBELINE,Cymbeline forgave old Bellarius; for who could think of punishments at
4077,CYMBELINE,"a season of such universal happiness: to find his daughter living, and"
4078,CYMBELINE,"his lost sons in the persons of his young deliverers, that he had seen"
4079,CYMBELINE,"so bravely fight in his defence, was unlooked-for joy indeed!"
4080,CYMBELINE,
4081,CYMBELINE,Imogen was now at leisure to perform good services for her late
4082,CYMBELINE,"master, the Roman general Lucius, whose life the king her father"
4083,CYMBELINE,readily granted at her request; and by the mediation of the same
4084,CYMBELINE,"Lucius a peace was concluded between the Romans and the Britons, which"
4085,CYMBELINE,was kept inviolate many years.
4086,CYMBELINE,
4087,CYMBELINE,"How Cymbeline's wicked queen, through despair of bringing her projects"
4088,CYMBELINE,"to pass, and touched with remorse of conscience, sickened and died,"
4089,CYMBELINE,having first lived to see her foolish son Cloten slain in a quarrel
4090,CYMBELINE,"which he had provoked, are events too tragical to interrupt this happy"
4091,CYMBELINE,conclusion by more than merely touching upon. It is sufficient that
4092,CYMBELINE,"all were made happy, who were deserving; and even the treacherous"
4093,CYMBELINE,"Iachimo, in consideration of his villainy having missed its final aim,"
4094,CYMBELINE,was dismissed without punishment.

4100,KING LEAR,
4101,KING LEAR,(_By Charles Lamb_)
4102,KING LEAR,
4103,KING LEAR,
4104,KING LEAR,"Lear, king of Britain, had three daughters; Gonerill, wife to the duke"
4105,KING LEAR,"of Albany; Regan, wife to the duke of Cornwall; and Cordelia, a young"
4106,KING LEAR,"maid, for whose love the king of France and duke of Burgundy were"
4107,KING LEAR,"joint suitors, and were at this time making stay for that purpose in"
4108,KING LEAR,the court of Lear.
4109,KING LEAR,
4110,KING LEAR,"The old king, worn out with age and the fatigues of government, he"
4111,KING LEAR,"being more than fourscore years old, determined to take no further"
4112,KING LEAR,"part in state affairs, but to leave the management to younger"
4113,KING LEAR,"strengths, that he might have time to prepare for death, which must at"
4114,KING LEAR,no long period ensue. With this intent he called his three daughters
4115,KING LEAR,"to him, to know from their own lips which of them loved him best, that"
4116,KING LEAR,he might part his kingdom among them in such proportions as their
4117,KING LEAR,affection for him should seem to deserve.

4119,KING LEAR,"Gonerill, the eldest, declared that she loved her father more than"
4120,KING LEAR,"words could give out, that he was dearer to her than the light of her"
4121,KING LEAR,"own eyes, dearer than life and liberty, with a deal of such professing"
4122,KING LEAR,"stuff, which is easy to counterfeit where there is no real love, only"
4123,KING LEAR,a few fine words delivered with confidence being wanted in that case.
4124,KING LEAR,"The king, delighted to hear from her own mouth this assurance of her"
4125,KING LEAR,"love, and thinking truly that her heart went with it, in a fit of"
4126,KING LEAR,fatherly fondness bestowed upon her and her husband one third of his
4127,KING LEAR,ample kingdom.
4128,KING LEAR,
4129,KING LEAR,"Then calling to him his second daughter, he demanded what she had to"
4130,KING LEAR,"say. Regan, who was made of the same hollow metal as her sister, was"
4131,KING LEAR,"not a whit behind in her professions, but rather declared that what"
4132,KING LEAR,her sister had spoken came short of the love which she professed to
4133,KING LEAR,"bear for his highness: insomuch that she found all other joys dead, in"
4134,KING LEAR,comparison with the pleasure which she took in the love of her dear
4135,KING LEAR,king and father.
4136,KING LEAR,
4137,KING LEAR,"Lear blest himself in having such loving children, as he thought; and"
4138,KING LEAR,"could do no less, after the handsome assurances which Regan had made,"
4139,KING LEAR,"than bestow a third of his kingdom upon her and her husband, equal in"
4140,KING LEAR,size to that which he had already given away to Gonerill.
4141,KING LEAR,
4142,KING LEAR,"Then turning to his youngest daughter Cordelia, whom he called his"
4143,KING LEAR,"joy, he asked what she had to say; thinking no doubt that she would"
4144,KING LEAR,glad his ears with the same loving speeches which her sisters had
4145,KING LEAR,"uttered, or rather that her expressions would be so much stronger than"
4146,KING LEAR,"theirs, as she had always been his darling, and favoured by him above"
4147,KING LEAR,"either of them. But Cordelia, disgusted with the flattery of her"
4148,KING LEAR,"sisters, whose hearts she knew were far from their lips, and seeing"
4149,KING LEAR,that all their coaxing speeches were only intended to wheedle the old
4150,KING LEAR,"king out of his dominions, that they and their husbands might reign"
4151,KING LEAR,"in his life-time, made no other reply but this, that she loved his"
4152,KING LEAR,"majesty according to her duty, neither more nor less."
4153,KING LEAR,
4154,KING LEAR,"The king, shocked with this appearance of ingratitude in his favourite"
4155,KING LEAR,"child, desired her to consider her words, and to mend her speech, lest"
4156,KING LEAR,it should mar her fortunes.
4157,KING LEAR,
4158,KING LEAR,"Cordelia then told her father, that he was her father, that he had"
4159,KING LEAR,"given her breeding, and loved her, that she returned those duties back"
4160,KING LEAR,"as was most fit, and did obey him, love him, and most honour him."
4161,KING LEAR,But that she could not frame her mouth to such large speeches as her
4162,KING LEAR,"sisters had done, or promise to love nothing else in the world. Why"
4163,KING LEAR,"had her sisters husbands, if (as they said) they had no love for any"
4164,KING LEAR,"thing but their father? If she should ever wed, she was sure the lord"
4165,KING LEAR,"to whom she gave her hand would want half her love, half of her care"
4166,KING LEAR,"and duty; she should never marry like her sisters, to love her father"
4167,KING LEAR,all.
4168,KING LEAR,
4169,KING LEAR,"Cordelia, who in earnest loved her old father, even almost as"
4170,KING LEAR,"extravagantly as her sisters pretended to do, would have plainly told"
4171,KING LEAR,"him so at any other time, in more daughter-like and loving terms,"
4172,KING LEAR,and without these qualifications which did indeed sound a little
4173,KING LEAR,"ungracious: but after the crafty flattering speeches of her sisters,"
4174,KING LEAR,"which she had seen draw such extravagant rewards, she thought the"
4175,KING LEAR,handsomest thing she could do was to love and be silent. This put her
4176,KING LEAR,"affection out of suspicion of mercenary ends, and shewed that"
4177,KING LEAR,"she loved, but not for gain; and that her professions, the less"
4178,KING LEAR,"ostentatious they were, had so much the more of truth and sincerity"
4179,KING LEAR,than her sisters.
4180,KING LEAR,
4181,KING LEAR,"This plainness of speech, which Lear called pride, so enraged the old"
4182,KING LEAR,monarch--who in his best of times always shewed much of spleen and
4183,KING LEAR,"rashness, and in whom the dotage incident to old age had so clouded"
4184,KING LEAR,"over his reason, that he could not discern truth from flattery, nor"
4185,KING LEAR,a gay painted speech from words that came from the heart--that in a
4186,KING LEAR,fury of resentment he retracted the third part of his kingdom which
4187,KING LEAR,"yet remained, and which he had reserved for Cordelia, and gave it"
4188,KING LEAR,"away from her, sharing it equally between her two sisters and their"
4189,KING LEAR,"husbands, the dukes of Albany and Cornwall: whom he now called to him,"
4190,KING LEAR,"and in presence of all his courtiers, bestowing a coronet between"
4191,KING LEAR,"them, invested them jointly with all the power, revenue, and execution"
4192,KING LEAR,"of government, only retaining to himself the name of king; all the"
4193,KING LEAR,"rest of royalty he resigned: with this reservation, that himself, with"
4194,KING LEAR,"a hundred knights for his attendants, was to be maintained by monthly"
4195,KING LEAR,course in each of his daughter's palaces in turn.
4196,KING LEAR,
4197,KING LEAR,"So preposterous a disposal of his kingdom, so little guided by reason,"
4198,KING LEAR,"and so much by passion, filled all his courtiers with astonishment"
4199,KING LEAR,and sorrow; but none of them had the courage to interpose between
4200,KING LEAR,"this incensed king and his wrath, except the earl of Kent, who was"
4201,KING LEAR,"beginning to speak a good word for Cordelia, when the passionate Lear"
4202,KING LEAR,on pain of death commanded him to desist: but the good Kent was not so
4203,KING LEAR,"to be repelled. He had been ever loyal to Lear, whom he had honoured"
4204,KING LEAR,"as a king, loved as a father, followed as a master: and had never"
4205,KING LEAR,esteemed his life further than as a pawn to wage against his royal
4206,KING LEAR,"master's enemies, nor feared to lose it when Lear's safety was the"
4207,KING LEAR,motive: nor now that Lear was most his own enemy did this faithful
4208,KING LEAR,"servant of the king forget his old principles, but manfully opposed"
4209,KING LEAR,"Lear, to do Lear good; and was unmannerly only because Lear was mad."
4210,KING LEAR,"He had been a most faithful counsellor in times past to the king, and"
4211,KING LEAR,"he besought him now, that he would see with his eyes (as he had done"
4212,KING LEAR,"in many weighty matters), and go by his advice still; and in his best"
4213,KING LEAR,consideration recall this hideous rashness: for he would answer with
4214,KING LEAR,"his life his judgment, that Lear's youngest daughter did not love him"
4215,KING LEAR,"least, nor were those empty-hearted whose low sound gave no token"
4216,KING LEAR,"of hollowness. When power bowed to flattery, honour was bound to"
4217,KING LEAR,"plainness. For Lear's threats, what could he do to him, whose life was"
4218,KING LEAR,already at his service? that should not hinder duty from speaking.
4219,KING LEAR,
4220,KING LEAR,The honest freedom of this good earl of Kent only stirred up the
4221,KING LEAR,"king's wrath the more, and like a frantic patient who kills his"
4222,KING LEAR,"physician, and loves his mortal disease, he banished this true"
4223,KING LEAR,"servant, and allotted him but five days to make his preparations for"
4224,KING LEAR,departure; but if on the sixth his hated person was found within the
4225,KING LEAR,"realm of Britain, that moment was to be his death. And Kent bade"
4226,KING LEAR,"farewel to the king, and said, that since he chose to shew himself in"
4227,KING LEAR,"such fashion, it was but banishment to stay there: and before he went,"
4228,KING LEAR,"he recommended Cordelia to the protection of the gods, the maid who"
4229,KING LEAR,"had so rightly thought, and so discreetly spoken; and only wished that"
4230,KING LEAR,her sisters' large speeches might be answered with deeds of love: and
4231,KING LEAR,"then he went, as he said, to shape his old course to a new country."
4232,KING LEAR,
4233,KING LEAR,The king of France and duke of Burgundy were now called in to hear the
4234,KING LEAR,"determination of Lear about his youngest daughter, and to know whether"
4235,KING LEAR,"they would persist in their courtship to Cordelia, now that she was"
4236,KING LEAR,"under her father's displeasure, and had no fortune but her own person"
4237,KING LEAR,"to recommend her: and the duke of Burgundy declined the match, and"
4238,KING LEAR,would not take her to wife upon such conditions; but the king of
4239,KING LEAR,"France, understanding what the nature of the fault had been which"
4240,KING LEAR,"had lost her the love of her father, that it was only a tardiness of"
4241,KING LEAR,"speech, and the not being able to frame her tongue to flattery like"
4242,KING LEAR,"her sisters, took this young maid by the hand, and saying that her"
4243,KING LEAR,"virtues were a dowry above a kingdom, bade Cordelia to take farewel"
4244,KING LEAR,"of her sisters, and of her father, though he had been unkind, and she"
4245,KING LEAR,"should go with him, and be queen of him and of fair France, and reign"
4246,KING LEAR,over fairer possessions than her sisters: and he called the duke of
4247,KING LEAR,"Burgundy in contempt a waterish duke, because his love for this young"
4248,KING LEAR,maid had in a moment run all away like water.
4249,KING LEAR,
4250,KING LEAR,"Then Cordelia with weeping eyes took leave of her sisters, and"
4251,KING LEAR,"besought them to love their father well, and make good their"
4252,KING LEAR,"professions: and they sullenly told her not to prescribe to them, for"
4253,KING LEAR,"they knew their duty; but to strive to content her husband, who had"
4254,KING LEAR,taken her (as they tauntingly expressed it) as Fortune's alms. And
4255,KING LEAR,"Cordelia with a heavy heart departed, for she knew the cunning of her"
4256,KING LEAR,"sisters, and she wished her father in better hands than she was about"
4257,KING LEAR,to leave him in.
4258,KING LEAR,
4259,KING LEAR,"Cordelia was no sooner gone, than the devilish dispositions of her"
4260,KING LEAR,sister began to shew themselves in their true colours. Even before the
4261,KING LEAR,expiration of the first month which Lear was to spend by agreement
4262,KING LEAR,"with his eldest daughter Gonerill, the old king began to find out the"
4263,KING LEAR,difference between promises and performances. This wretch having got
4264,KING LEAR,"from her father all that he had to bestow, even to the giving away of"
4265,KING LEAR,"the crown from off his head, began to grudge even those small remnants"
4266,KING LEAR,"of royalty which the old man had reserved to himself, to please his"
4267,KING LEAR,fancy with the idea of being still a king. She could not bear to see
4268,KING LEAR,"him and his hundred knights. Every time she met her father, she put on"
4269,KING LEAR,"a frowning countenance; and when the old man wanted to speak with her,"
4270,KING LEAR,she would feign sickness or any thing to be rid of the sight of him;
4271,KING LEAR,"for it was plain that she esteemed his old age a useless burden, and"
4272,KING LEAR,his attendants an unnecessary expence: not only she herself slackened
4273,KING LEAR,"in her expressions of duty to the king, but by her example, and (it is"
4274,KING LEAR,"to be feared) not without her private instructions, her very servants"
4275,KING LEAR,"affected to treat him with neglect, and would either refuse to obey"
4276,KING LEAR,"his orders, or still more contemptuously pretend not to hear them."
4277,KING LEAR,Lear could not but perceive this alteration in the behaviour of his
4278,KING LEAR,"daughter, but he shut his eyes against it as long as he could, as"
4279,KING LEAR,people commonly are unwilling to believe the unpleasant consequences
4280,KING LEAR,which their own mistakes and obstinacy have brought upon them.
4281,KING LEAR,
4282,KING LEAR,"True love and fidelity are no more to be estranged by _ill_, than"
4283,KING LEAR,falsehood and hollow-heartedness can be conciliated by _good usage_.
4284,KING LEAR,"This eminently appears in the instance of the good earl of Kent, who,"
4285,KING LEAR,"though banished by Lear, and his life made forfeit if he were found in"
4286,KING LEAR,"Britain, chose to stay and abide all consequences, as long as there"
4287,KING LEAR,was a chance of his being useful to the king his master. See to what
4288,KING LEAR,mean shifts and disguises poor loyalty is forced to submit sometimes;
4289,KING LEAR,yet it counts nothing base or unworthy so as it can but do service
4290,KING LEAR,"where it owes an obligation! In the disguise of a serving-man, all his"
4291,KING LEAR,"greatness and pomp laid aside, this good earl proffered his services"
4292,KING LEAR,"to the king, who not knowing him to be Kent in that disguise, but"
4293,KING LEAR,"pleased with a certain plainness, or rather bluntness in his answers"
4294,KING LEAR,which the earl put on (so different from that smooth oily flattery
4295,KING LEAR,"which he had so much reason to be sick of, having found the effects"
4296,KING LEAR,"not answerable in his daughter), a bargain was quickly struck, and"
4297,KING LEAR,"Lear took Kent into his service by the name of Caius, as he called"
4298,KING LEAR,"himself, never suspecting him to be his once great favourite, the high"
4299,KING LEAR,and mighty earl of Kent.
4300,KING LEAR,
4301,KING LEAR,This Caius quickly found means to shew his fidelity and love to his
4302,KING LEAR,royal master: for Gonerill's steward that same day behaving in a
4303,KING LEAR,"disrespectful manner to Lear, and giving him saucy looks and language,"
4304,KING LEAR,"as no doubt he was secretly encouraged to do by his mistress, Caius"
4305,KING LEAR,"not enduring to hear so open an affront put upon majesty, made no more"
4306,KING LEAR,"ado but presently tript up his heels, and laid the unmannerly slave"
4307,KING LEAR,in the kennel: for which friendly service Lear became more and more
4308,KING LEAR,attached to him.
4309,KING LEAR,
4310,KING LEAR,"Nor was Kent the only friend Lear had. In his degree, and as far as"
4311,KING LEAR,"so insignificant a personage could shew his love, the poor fool, or"
4312,KING LEAR,"jester, that had been of his palace while Lear had a palace, as it was"
4313,KING LEAR,the custom of kings and great personages at that time to keep a fool
4314,KING LEAR,(as he was called) to make them sport after serious business:--this
4315,KING LEAR,"poor fool clung to Lear after he had given away his crown, and by"
4316,KING LEAR,his witty sayings would keep up his good humour; though he could not
4317,KING LEAR,"refrain sometimes from jeering at his master for his imprudence, in"
4318,KING LEAR,"uncrowning himself, and giving all away to his daughters: at which"
4319,KING LEAR,"time, as he rhymingly expressed it, these daughters"
4320,KING LEAR,
4321,KING LEAR,"For sudden joy did weep,"
4322,KING LEAR,"And he for sorrow sung,"
4323,KING LEAR,"That such a king should play bo-peep,"
4324,KING LEAR,And go the fools among.
4325,KING LEAR,
4326,KING LEAR,"And in such wild sayings, and scraps of songs, of which he had plenty,"
4327,KING LEAR,this pleasant honest fool poured out his heart even in the presence
4328,KING LEAR,"of Gonerill herself, in many a bitter taunt and jest which cut to the"
4329,KING LEAR,"quick; such as comparing the king to the hedge-sparrow, who feeds the"
4330,KING LEAR,"young of the cuckoo till they grow old enough, and then has its head"
4331,KING LEAR,"bit off for its pains: and saying, that an ass may know when the cart"
4332,KING LEAR,"draws the horse (meaning that Lear's daughters, that ought to go"
4333,KING LEAR,"behind, now ranked before their father); and that Lear was no longer"
4334,KING LEAR,"Lear, but the shadow of Lear: for which free speeches he was once or"
4335,KING LEAR,twice threatened to be whipt.
4336,KING LEAR,
4337,KING LEAR,The coolness and falling off of respect which Lear had begun to
4338,KING LEAR,"perceive, were not all which this foolish-fond father was to suffer"
4339,KING LEAR,from his unworthy daughter: she now plainly told him that his staying
4340,KING LEAR,in her palace was inconvenient so long as he insisted upon keeping up
4341,KING LEAR,an establishment of a hundred knights; that this establishment was
4342,KING LEAR,"useless and expensive, and only served to fill her court with riot and"
4343,KING LEAR,"feasting; and she prayed him that he would lessen their number, and"
4344,KING LEAR,"keep none but old men about him, such as himself, and fitting his age."
4345,KING LEAR,
4346,KING LEAR,"Lear at first could not believe his eyes or ears, nor that it was his"
4347,KING LEAR,daughter who spoke so unkindly. He could not believe that she who
4348,KING LEAR,"had received a crown from him could seek to cut off his train, and"
4349,KING LEAR,grudge him the respect due to his old age. But she persisting in her
4350,KING LEAR,"undutiful demand, the old man's rage was so excited, that he called"
4351,KING LEAR,"her a detested kite, and said that she spoke an untruth: and so indeed"
4352,KING LEAR,"she did, for the hundred knights were all men of choice behaviour"
4353,KING LEAR,"and sobriety of manners, skilled in all particulars of duty, and not"
4354,KING LEAR,given to rioting or feasting as she said. And he bid his horses to
4355,KING LEAR,"be prepared, for he would go to his other daughter, Regan, he and"
4356,KING LEAR,"his hundred knights: and he spoke of ingratitude, and said it was a"
4357,KING LEAR,"marble-hearted devil, and shewed more hideous in a child than the"
4358,KING LEAR,sea-monster. And he cursed his eldest daughter Gonerill so as was
4359,KING LEAR,"terrible to hear: praying that she might never have a child, or if she"
4360,KING LEAR,"had, that it might live to return that scorn and contempt upon her,"
4361,KING LEAR,which she had shewn to him: that she might feel how sharper than a
4362,KING LEAR,serpent's tooth it was to have a thankless child. And Gonerill's
4363,KING LEAR,"husband, the duke of Albany, beginning to excuse himself for any share"
4364,KING LEAR,"which Lear might suppose he had in the unkindness, Lear would not hear"
4365,KING LEAR,"him out, but in a rage ordered his horses to be saddled, and set out"
4366,KING LEAR,"with his followers for the abode of Regan, his other daughter. And"
4367,KING LEAR,"Lear thought to himself, how small the fault of Cordelia (if it was a"
4368,KING LEAR,"fault) now appeared, in comparison with her sister's, and he wept; and"
4369,KING LEAR,then he was ashamed that such a creature as Gonerill should have so
4370,KING LEAR,much power over his manhood as to make him weep.
4371,KING LEAR,
4372,KING LEAR,Regan and her husband were keeping their court in great pomp and state
4373,KING LEAR,at their palace: and Lear dispatched his servant Caius with letters
4374,KING LEAR,"to his daughter, that she might be prepared for his reception, while"
4375,KING LEAR,he and his train followed after. But it seems that Gonerill had been
4376,KING LEAR,"beforehand with him, sending letters also to Regan, accusing her"
4377,KING LEAR,"father of waywardness and ill humours, and advising her not to receive"
4378,KING LEAR,so great a train as he was bringing with him. This messenger arrived
4379,KING LEAR,"at the same time with Caius, and Caius and he met: and who should it"
4380,KING LEAR,"be but Caius' old enemy the steward, whom he had formerly tript up"
4381,KING LEAR,by the heels for his saucy behaviour to Lear. Caius not liking the
4382,KING LEAR,"fellow's look, and suspecting what he came for, began to revile him,"
4383,KING LEAR,"and challenged him to fight, which the fellow refusing, Caius, in a"
4384,KING LEAR,"fit of honest passion, beat him soundly, as such a mischief-maker and"
4385,KING LEAR,carrier of wicked messages deserved: which coming to the ears of Regan
4386,KING LEAR,"and her husband, they ordered Caius to be put in the stocks, though"
4387,KING LEAR,"he was a messenger from the king her father, and in that character"
4388,KING LEAR,demanded the highest respect: so that the first thing the king saw
4389,KING LEAR,"when he entered the castle, was his faithful servant Caius sitting in"
4390,KING LEAR,that disgraceful situation.
4391,KING LEAR,
4392,KING LEAR,This was but a bad omen of the reception which he was to expect; but
4393,KING LEAR,"a worse followed, when upon enquiry for his daughter and her husband,"
4394,KING LEAR,"he was told they were weary with travelling all night, and could not"
4395,KING LEAR,"see him: and when lastly, upon his insisting in a positive and angry"
4396,KING LEAR,"manner to see them, they came to greet him, whom should he see in"
4397,KING LEAR,"their company but the hated Gonerill, who had come to tell her own"
4398,KING LEAR,"story, and set her sister against the king her father!"
4399,KING LEAR,
4400,KING LEAR,"This sight much moved the old man, and still more to see Regan take"
4401,KING LEAR,her by the hand: and he asked Gonerill if she was not ashamed to look
4402,KING LEAR,upon his old white beard? And Regan advised him to go home again
4403,KING LEAR,"with Gonerill, and live with her peaceably, dismissing half of his"
4404,KING LEAR,"attendants, and to ask her forgiveness; for he was old and wanted"
4405,KING LEAR,"discretion, and must be ruled and led by persons that had more"
4406,KING LEAR,discretion than himself. And Lear shewed how preposterous that would
4407,KING LEAR,"sound, if he were to down on his knees, and beg of his own daughter"
4408,KING LEAR,"for food and raiment, and he argued against such an unnatural"
4409,KING LEAR,"dependence; declaring his resolution never to return with her, but to"
4410,KING LEAR,"stay where he was with Regan, he and his hundred knights: for he said"
4411,KING LEAR,that she had not forgot the half of the kingdom which he had endowed
4412,KING LEAR,"her with, and that her eyes were not fierce like Gonerill's, but mild"
4413,KING LEAR,"and kind. And he said that rather than return to Gonerill, with half"
4414,KING LEAR,"his train cut off, he would go over to France, and beg a wretched"
4415,KING LEAR,"pension of the king there, who had married his youngest daughter"
4416,KING LEAR,without a portion.
4417,KING LEAR,
4418,KING LEAR,But he was mistaken in expecting kinder treatment of Regan than he
4419,KING LEAR,had experienced from her sister Gonerill. As if willing to outdo her
4420,KING LEAR,"sister in unfilial behaviour, she declared that she thought fifty"
4421,KING LEAR,knights too many to wait upon him: that five-and-twenty were enough.
4422,KING LEAR,"Then Lear, nigh heart-broken, turned to Gonerill, and said that he"
4423,KING LEAR,"would go back with her, for her fifty doubled five-and-twenty, and so"
4424,KING LEAR,"her love was twice as much as Regan's. But Gonerill excused herself,"
4425,KING LEAR,"and said, what need of so many as five-and-twenty? or even ten? or"
4426,KING LEAR,"five? when he might be waited upon by her servants, or her sister's"
4427,KING LEAR,"servants? So these two wicked daughters, as if they strove to exceed"
4428,KING LEAR,each other in cruelty to their old father who had been so good to
4429,KING LEAR,"them, by little and little would have abated him of all his train, all"
4430,KING LEAR,respect (little enough for him that once commanded a kingdom) which
4431,KING LEAR,was left him to shew that he had once been a king! Not that a splendid
4432,KING LEAR,"train is essential to happiness, but from a king to a beggar is a hard"
4433,KING LEAR,"change, from commanding millions to be without one attendant; and"
4434,KING LEAR,"it was the ingratitude in his daughters' denying it, more than what"
4435,KING LEAR,"he would suffer by the want of it, which pierced this poor king to"
4436,KING LEAR,"the heart: insomuch that with this double ill usage, and vexation"
4437,KING LEAR,"for having so foolishly given away a kingdom, his wits began to be"
4438,KING LEAR,"unsettled, and while he said he knew not what, he vowed revenge"
4439,KING LEAR,"against those unnatural hags, and to make examples of them that should"
4440,KING LEAR,be a terror to the earth!
4441,KING LEAR,
4442,KING LEAR,While he was thus idly threatening what his weak arm could never
4443,KING LEAR,"execute, night came on, and a loud storm of thunder and lightning"
4444,KING LEAR,with rain; and his daughters still persisting in their resolution not
4445,KING LEAR,"to admit his followers, he called for his horses, and chose rather"
4446,KING LEAR,"to encounter the utmost fury of the storm abroad, than stay under"
4447,KING LEAR,the same roof with these ungrateful daughters: and they saying that
4448,KING LEAR,the injuries which wilful men procure to themselves are their just
4449,KING LEAR,"punishment, suffered him to go in that condition, and shut their doors"
4450,KING LEAR,upon him.
4451,KING LEAR,
4452,KING LEAR,"The winds were high, and the rain and storm increased, when the old"
4453,KING LEAR,"man sallied forth to combat with the elements, less sharp than his"
4454,KING LEAR,daughters' unkindness. For many miles about there was scarce a bush;
4455,KING LEAR,"and there upon a heath, exposed to the fury of the storm in a dark"
4456,KING LEAR,"night, did king Lear wander out, and defy the winds and the thunder:"
4457,KING LEAR,"and he bid the winds to blow the earth into the sea, or swell the"
4458,KING LEAR,"waves of the sea till they drowned the earth, that no token might"
4459,KING LEAR,remain of any such ungrateful animal as man. The old king was now left
4460,KING LEAR,"with no other companion than the poor fool, who still abided with him,"
4461,KING LEAR,"with his merry conceits striving to out-jest misfortune, saying, it"
4462,KING LEAR,"was but a naughty night to swim in, and truly the king had better go"
4463,KING LEAR,in and ask his daughter's blessing:
4464,KING LEAR,
4465,KING LEAR,"But he that has a little tiny wit,"
4466,KING LEAR,"With heigh ho, the wind and the rain!"
4467,KING LEAR,"Must make content with his fortunes fit,"
4468,KING LEAR,Though the rain it raineth every day:
4469,KING LEAR,
4470,KING LEAR,and swearing it was a brave night to cool a lady's pride.
4471,KING LEAR,
4472,KING LEAR,Thus poorly accompanied this once great monarch was found by his ever
4473,KING LEAR,"faithful servant the good earl of Kent, now transformed to Caius, who"
4474,KING LEAR,"ever followed close at his side, though the king did not know him to"
4475,KING LEAR,"be the earl; and he said, ""Alas! sir, are you here? creatures that"
4476,KING LEAR,"love night, love not such nights as these. This dreadful storm has"
4477,KING LEAR,driven the beasts to their hiding places. Man's nature cannot endure
4478,KING LEAR,"the affliction or the fear."" And Lear rebuked him and said, these"
4479,KING LEAR,"lesser evils were not felt, where a greater malady was fixed. When the"
4480,KING LEAR,"mind is at ease, the body has leisure to be delicate; but the tempest"
4481,KING LEAR,"in his mind did take all feeling else from his senses, but of that"
4482,KING LEAR,"which beat at his heart. And he spoke of filial ingratitude, and said"
4483,KING LEAR,it was all one as if the mouth should tear the hand for lifting food
4484,KING LEAR,to it; for parents were hands and food and everything to children.
4485,KING LEAR,
4486,KING LEAR,But the good Caius still persisting in his intreaties that the king
4487,KING LEAR,"would not stay out in the open air, at last persuaded him to enter"
4488,KING LEAR,"a little wretched hovel which stood upon the heath, where the fool"
4489,KING LEAR,"first entering, suddenly ran back terrified, saying that he had seen"
4490,KING LEAR,a spirit. But upon examination this spirit proved to be nothing more
4491,KING LEAR,"than a poor Bedlam-beggar, who had crept into this deserted hovel for"
4492,KING LEAR,"shelter, and with his talk about devils frighted the fool, one of"
4493,KING LEAR,"those poor lunatics who are either mad, or feign to be so, the better"
4494,KING LEAR,to extort charity from the compassionate country-people; who go about
4495,KING LEAR,"the country, calling themselves poor Tom and poor Turlygood, saying,"
4496,KING LEAR,"""Who gives any thing to poor Tom?"" sticking pins and nails and sprigs"
4497,KING LEAR,of rosemary into their arms to make them bleed; and with such horrible
4498,KING LEAR,"actions, partly by prayers, and partly with lunatic curses, they move"
4499,KING LEAR,or terrify the ignorant country-folks into giving them alms. This
4500,KING LEAR,poor fellow was such a one; and the king seeing him in so wretched
4501,KING LEAR,"a plight, with nothing but a blanket about his loins to cover his"
4502,KING LEAR,"nakedness, could not be persuaded but that the fellow was some father"
4503,KING LEAR,"who had given all away to his daughters, and brought himself to that"
4504,KING LEAR,pass: for nothing he thought could bring a man to such wretchedness
4505,KING LEAR,but the having unkind daughters.
4506,KING LEAR,
4507,KING LEAR,"And from this and many such wild speeches which he uttered, the good"
4508,KING LEAR,"Caius plainly perceived that he was not in his perfect mind, but that"
4509,KING LEAR,his daughters' ill usage had really made him go mad. And now the
4510,KING LEAR,loyalty of this worthy earl of Kent shewed itself in more essential
4511,KING LEAR,services than he had hitherto found opportunity to perform. For with
4512,KING LEAR,"the assistance of some of the king's attendants who remained loyal, he"
4513,KING LEAR,had the person of his royal master removed at day-break to the castle
4514,KING LEAR,"of Dover, where his own friends and influence, as earl of Kent,"
4515,KING LEAR,"chiefly lay: and himself embarking for France, hastened to the court"
4516,KING LEAR,"of Cordelia, and did there in such moving terms represent the pitiful"
4517,KING LEAR,"condition of her royal father, and set out in such lively colours the"
4518,KING LEAR,"inhumanity of her sisters, that this good and loving child with many"
4519,KING LEAR,"tears besought the king her husband, that he would give her leave"
4520,KING LEAR,to embark for England with a sufficient power to subdue these cruel
4521,KING LEAR,"daughters and their husbands, and restore the old king her father to"
4522,KING LEAR,"his throne; which being granted, she set forth, and with a royal army"
4523,KING LEAR,landed at Dover.
4524,KING LEAR,
4525,KING LEAR,Lear having by some chance escaped from the guardians which the good
4526,KING LEAR,"earl of Kent had put over him to take care of him in his lunacy,"
4527,KING LEAR,"was found by some of Cordelia's train, wandering about the fields"
4528,KING LEAR,"near Dover, in a pitiable condition, stark mad and singing aloud"
4529,KING LEAR,"to himself, with a crown upon his head which he had made of straw,"
4530,KING LEAR,"and nettles, and other wild weeds that he had picked up in the"
4531,KING LEAR,"corn-fields. By the advice of the physicians, Cordelia, though"
4532,KING LEAR,"earnestly desirous of seeing her father, was prevailed upon to put off"
4533,KING LEAR,"the meeting, till, by sleep and the operation of herbs which they gave"
4534,KING LEAR,"him, he should be restored to greater composure. By the aid of these"
4535,KING LEAR,"skilful physicians, to whom Cordelia promised all her gold and jewels"
4536,KING LEAR,"for the recovery of the old king, Lear was soon in a condition to see"
4537,KING LEAR,his daughter.
4538,KING LEAR,
4539,KING LEAR,A tender sight it was to see the meeting between this father and
4540,KING LEAR,daughter: to see the struggles between the joy of this poor old king
4541,KING LEAR,"at beholding again his once darling child, and the shame at receiving"
4542,KING LEAR,such filial kindness from her whom he had cast off for so small a
4543,KING LEAR,fault in his displeasure; both these passions struggling with the
4544,KING LEAR,"remains of his malady, which in his half-crazed brain sometimes"
4545,KING LEAR,"made him that he scarce remembered where he was, or who it was that"
4546,KING LEAR,so kindly kissed him and spoke to him: and then he would beg the
4547,KING LEAR,"standers-by not to laugh at him, if he were mistaken in thinking this"
4548,KING LEAR,lady to be his daughter Cordelia! And then to see him fall on his
4549,KING LEAR,"knees to beg pardon of his child; and she, good lady, kneeling all the"
4550,KING LEAR,"while to ask a blessing of him, and telling him that it did not become"
4551,KING LEAR,"him to kneel, but it was her duty, for she was his child, his true and"
4552,KING LEAR,very child Cordelia! And she kissed him (as she said) to kiss away
4553,KING LEAR,"all her sisters' unkindness, and said that they might be ashamed of"
4554,KING LEAR,"themselves, to turn their old kind father with his white beard out"
4555,KING LEAR,"into the cold air, when her enemy's dog, though it had bit her (as she"
4556,KING LEAR,"prettily expressed it), should have staid by her fire such a night as"
4557,KING LEAR,"that, and warmed himself. And she told her father how she had come"
4558,KING LEAR,"from France with purpose to bring him assistance; and he said, that"
4559,KING LEAR,"she must forget and forgive, for he was old and foolish, and did not"
4560,KING LEAR,know what he did; but that to be sure she had great cause not to love
4561,KING LEAR,"him, but her sisters had none. And Cordelia said, that she had no"
4562,KING LEAR,"cause, no more than they had."
4563,KING LEAR,
4564,KING LEAR,So we will leave this old king in the protection of this dutiful and
4565,KING LEAR,"loving child, where, by the help of sleep and medicine, she and her"
4566,KING LEAR,physicians at length succeeded in winding up the untuned and jarring
4567,KING LEAR,senses which the cruelty of his other daughters had so violently
4568,KING LEAR,shaken. Let us return to say a word or two about those cruel
4569,KING LEAR,daughters.
4570,KING LEAR,
4571,KING LEAR,"These monsters of ingratitude, who had been so false to their old"
4572,KING LEAR,"father, could not be expected to prove more faithful to their own"
4573,KING LEAR,husbands. They soon grew tired of paying even the appearance of duty
4574,KING LEAR,"and affection, and in an open way shewed they had fixed their loves"
4575,KING LEAR,upon another. It happened that the object of their guilty loves was
4576,KING LEAR,"the same. It was Edmund, a natural son of the late earl of Gloucester,"
4577,KING LEAR,who by his treacheries had succeeded in disinheriting his brother
4578,KING LEAR,"Edgar the lawful heir from his earldom, and by his wicked practices"
4579,KING LEAR,"was now earl himself: a wicked man, and a fit object for the love of"
4580,KING LEAR,such wicked creatures as Gonerill and Regan. It falling out about
4581,KING LEAR,"this time that the duke of Cornwall, Regan's husband, died, Regan"
4582,KING LEAR,"immediately declared her intention of wedding this earl of Gloucester,"
4583,KING LEAR,"which rousing the jealousy of her sister, to whom as well as to Regan"
4584,KING LEAR,"this wicked earl had at sundry times professed love, Gonerill found"
4585,KING LEAR,means to make away with her sister by poison: but being detected in
4586,KING LEAR,"her practices, and imprisoned by her husband the duke of Albany, for"
4587,KING LEAR,"this deed, and for her guilty passion for the earl which had come to"
4588,KING LEAR,"his ears, she in a fit of disappointed love and rage shortly put an"
4589,KING LEAR,end to her own life. Thus the justice of Heaven at last overtook these
4590,KING LEAR,wicked daughters.
4591,KING LEAR,
4592,KING LEAR,"While the eyes of all men were upon this event, admiring the justice"
4593,KING LEAR,"displayed in their deserved deaths, the same eyes were suddenly taken"
4594,KING LEAR,off from this sight to admire at the mysterious ways of the same power
4595,KING LEAR,"in the melancholy fate of the young and virtuous daughter, the lady"
4596,KING LEAR,"Cordelia, whose good deeds did seem to deserve a more fortunate"
4597,KING LEAR,"conclusion: but it is an awful truth, that innocence and piety are not"
4598,KING LEAR,always successful in this world. The forces which Gonerill and Regan
4599,KING LEAR,had sent out under the command of the bad earl of Gloucester were
4600,KING LEAR,"victorious, and Cordelia by the practices of this wicked earl, who did"
4601,KING LEAR,"not like that any should stand between him and the throne, ended her"
4602,KING LEAR,"life in prison. Thus, Heaven took this innocent lady to itself in her"
4603,KING LEAR,"young years, after shewing her to the world an illustrious example of"
4604,KING LEAR,filial duty. Lear did not long survive this kind child.
4605,KING LEAR,
4606,KING LEAR,"Before he died, the good earl of Kent, who had still attended his old"
4607,KING LEAR,master's steps from the first of his daughters' ill usage to this sad
4608,KING LEAR,"period of his decay, tried to make him understand that it was he who"
4609,KING LEAR,had followed him under the name of Caius; but Lear's care-crazed brain
4610,KING LEAR,"at that time could not comprehend how that could be, or how Kent and"
4611,KING LEAR,Caius could be the same person: so Kent thought it needless to trouble
4612,KING LEAR,"him with explanations at such a time; and Lear soon after expiring,"
4613,KING LEAR,"this faithful servant to the king, between age and grief for his old"
4614,KING LEAR,"master's vexations, soon followed him to the grave."
4615,KING LEAR,
4616,KING LEAR,"How the judgment of Heaven overtook the bad earl of Gloucester, whose"
4617,KING LEAR,"treasons were discovered, and himself slain in single combat with"
4618,KING LEAR,"his brother, the lawful earl; and how Gonerill's husband, the duke"
4619,KING LEAR,"of Albany, who was innocent of the death of Cordelia, and had never"
4620,KING LEAR,"encouraged his lady in her wicked proceedings against her father,"
4621,KING LEAR,"ascended the throne of Britain after the death of Lear, is needless"
4622,KING LEAR,"here to narrate; Lear and his Three Daughters being dead, whose"
4623,KING LEAR,adventures alone concern our story.
4624,KING LEAR,

4629,MACBETH,
4630,MACBETH,(_By Charles Lamb_)
4631,MACBETH,
4632,MACBETH,
4633,MACBETH,"When Duncan the Meek reigned king of Scotland, there lived a great"
4634,MACBETH,"thane, or lord, called Macbeth. This Macbeth was a near kinsman to the"
4635,MACBETH,"king, and in great esteem at court for his valour and conduct in the"
4636,MACBETH,"wars; an example of which he had lately given, in defeating a rebel"
4637,MACBETH,army assisted by the troops of Norway in terrible numbers.
4638,MACBETH,
4639,MACBETH,"The two Scottish generals, Macbeth and Banquo, returning victorious"
4640,MACBETH,"from this great battle, their way lay over a blasted heath, where they"
4641,MACBETH,"were stopped by the strange appearance of three figures, like women,"
4642,MACBETH,"except that they had beards, and their withered skins and wild attire"
4643,MACBETH,made them look not like any earthly creatures. Macbeth first addressed
4644,MACBETH,"them, when they, seemingly offended, laid each one her choppy finger"
4645,MACBETH,"upon her skinny lips, in token of silence: and the first of them"
4646,MACBETH,saluted Macbeth with the title of thane of Glamis. The general was
4647,MACBETH,not a little startled to find himself known by such creatures; but
4648,MACBETH,"how much more, when the second of them followed up that salute by"
4649,MACBETH,"giving him the title of thane of Cawdor, to which honour he had no"
4650,MACBETH,"pretensions! and again the third bid him ""All hail! king that shall be"
4651,MACBETH,"hereafter!"" Such a prophetic greeting might well amaze him, who knew"
4652,MACBETH,that while the king's sons lived he could not hope to succeed to the
4653,MACBETH,"throne. Then turning to Banquo, they pronounced him, in a sort of"
4654,MACBETH,"riddling terms, to be _lesser than Macbeth and greater! not so happy,"
4655,MACBETH,"but much happier!_ and prophesied that though he should never reign,"
4656,MACBETH,yet his sons after him should be kings in Scotland. They then turned
4657,MACBETH,"into air, and vanished: by which the generals knew them to be the"
4658,MACBETH,"weird sisters, or witches."
4659,MACBETH,
4660,MACBETH,"While they stood pondering on the strangeness of this adventure,"
4661,MACBETH,"there arrived certain messengers from the king, who were empowered by"
4662,MACBETH,him to confer upon Macbeth the dignity of thane of Cawdor. An event
4663,MACBETH,so miraculously corresponding with the prediction of the witches
4664,MACBETH,"astonished Macbeth, and he stood wrapt in amazement, unable to make"
4665,MACBETH,reply to the messengers: and in that point of time swelling hopes
4666,MACBETH,"arose in his mind, that the prediction of the third witch might in"
4667,MACBETH,"like manner have its accomplishment, and that he should one day reign"
4668,MACBETH,king in Scotland.
4669,MACBETH,
4670,MACBETH,"Turning to Banquo, he said, ""Do you not hope that your children shall"
4671,MACBETH,"be kings, when what the witches promised to me has so wonderfully come"
4672,MACBETH,"to pass?"" ""That hope,"" answered the general, ""might enkindle you to"
4673,MACBETH,aim at the throne; but oftentimes these ministers of darkness tell
4674,MACBETH,"us truths in little things, to betray us into deeds of greatest"
4675,MACBETH,"consequence."""
4676,MACBETH,
4677,MACBETH,But the wicked suggestions of the witches had sunk too deep into the
4678,MACBETH,"mind of Macbeth, to allow him to attend to the warnings of the good"
4679,MACBETH,Banquo. From that time he bent all his thoughts how to compass the
4680,MACBETH,crown of Scotland.
4681,MACBETH,
4682,MACBETH,"Macbeth had a wife, to whom he communicated the strange prediction"
4683,MACBETH,"of the weird sisters, and its partial accomplishment. She was a bad"
4684,MACBETH,"ambitious woman, and so as her husband and herself could arrive at"
4685,MACBETH,"greatness, she cared not much by what means. She spurred on the"
4686,MACBETH,"reluctant purpose of Macbeth, who felt compunction at the thoughts of"
4687,MACBETH,"blood, and did not cease to represent the murder of the king as a step"
4688,MACBETH,absolutely necessary to the fulfilment of the flattering prophecy.
4689,MACBETH,
4690,MACBETH,"It happened at this time that the king, who out of his royal"
4691,MACBETH,condescension would oftentimes visit his principal nobility upon
4692,MACBETH,"gracious terms, came to Macbeth's house, attended by his two sons,"
4693,MACBETH,"Malcolm and Donalbain, and a numerous train of thanes and attendants,"
4694,MACBETH,the more to honour Macbeth for the triumphal success of his wars.
4695,MACBETH,
4696,MACBETH,"The castle of Macbeth was pleasantly situated, and the air about"
4697,MACBETH,"it was sweet and wholesome, which appeared by the nests which the"
4698,MACBETH,"martlet, or swallow, had built under all the jutting friezes and"
4699,MACBETH,"buttresses of the building, wherever it found a place of advantage:"
4700,MACBETH,"for where those birds most breed and haunt, the air is observed to"
4701,MACBETH,"be delicate. The king entered, well pleased with the place, and not"
4702,MACBETH,"less so with the attentions and respect of his honoured hostess, lady"
4703,MACBETH,"Macbeth, who had the art of covering treacherous purposes with smiles;"
4704,MACBETH,"and could look like the innocent flower, while she was indeed the"
4705,MACBETH,serpent under it.
4706,MACBETH,
4707,MACBETH,"The king, being tired with his journey, went early to bed, and in his"
4708,MACBETH,state-room two grooms of his chamber (as was the custom) slept beside
4709,MACBETH,"him. He had been unusually pleased with his reception, and had made"
4710,MACBETH,"presents, before he retired, to his principal officers; and among the"
4711,MACBETH,"rest, had sent a rich diamond to lady Macbeth, greeting her by the"
4712,MACBETH,name of his most kind hostess.
4713,MACBETH,
4714,MACBETH,"Now was the middle of the night, when over half the world nature seems"
4715,MACBETH,"dead, and wicked dreams abuse men's minds asleep, and none but the"
4716,MACBETH,wolf and the murderer is abroad. This was the time when lady Macbeth
4717,MACBETH,waked to plot the murder of the king. She would not have undertaken
4718,MACBETH,"a deed so abhorrent to her sex, but that she feared her husband's"
4719,MACBETH,"nature, that it was too full of the milk of human kindness, to do"
4720,MACBETH,"a contrived murder. She knew him to be ambitious, but withal to be"
4721,MACBETH,"scrupulous, and not yet prepared for that height of crime which"
4722,MACBETH,commonly in the end accompanies inordinate ambition. She had won him
4723,MACBETH,"to consent to the murder, but she doubted his resolution: and she"
4724,MACBETH,feared that the natural tenderness of his disposition (more humane
4725,MACBETH,"than her own) would come between, and defeat the purpose. So with her"
4726,MACBETH,"own hands armed with a dagger, she approached the king's bed; having"
4727,MACBETH,"taken care to ply the grooms of his chamber so with wine, that they"
4728,MACBETH,"slept intoxicated, and careless of their charge. There lay Duncan, in"
4729,MACBETH,"a sound sleep after the fatigues of his journey, and as she viewed"
4730,MACBETH,"him earnestly, there was something in his face, as he slept, which"
4731,MACBETH,resembled her own father; and she had not the courage to proceed.
4732,MACBETH,
4733,MACBETH,She returned to confer with her husband. His resolution had begun
4734,MACBETH,to stagger. He considered that there were strong reasons against
4735,MACBETH,"the deed. In the first place, he was not only a subject, but a near"
4736,MACBETH,kinsman to the king; and he had been his host and entertainer that
4737,MACBETH,"day, whose duty by the laws of hospitality it was to shut the door"
4738,MACBETH,"against his murderers, not bear the knife himself. Then he considered"
4739,MACBETH,"how just and merciful a king this Duncan had been, how clear of"
4740,MACBETH,"offence to his subjects, how loving to his nobility, and in particular"
4741,MACBETH,"to him; that such kings are the peculiar care of Heaven, and their"
4742,MACBETH,"subjects doubly bound to revenge their deaths. Besides, by the favours"
4743,MACBETH,"of the king, Macbeth stood high in the opinion of all sorts of men,"
4744,MACBETH,and how would those honours be stained by the reputation of so foul a
4745,MACBETH,murder!
4746,MACBETH,
4747,MACBETH,"In these conflicts of the mind lady Macbeth found her husband,"
4748,MACBETH,"inclining to the better part, and resolving to proceed no further. But"
4749,MACBETH,"she being a woman not easily shaken from her evil purpose, began to"
4750,MACBETH,pour in at his ears words which infused a portion of her own spirit
4751,MACBETH,"into his mind, assigning reason upon reason why he should not shrink"
4752,MACBETH,from what he had undertaken; how easy the deed was; how soon it would
4753,MACBETH,be over; and how the action of one short night would give to all their
4754,MACBETH,nights and days to come sovereign sway and royalty! Then she threw
4755,MACBETH,"contempt on his change of purpose, and accused him of fickleness and"
4756,MACBETH,"cowardice; and declared that she had given suck, and knew how tender"
4757,MACBETH,"it was to love the babe that milked her, but she would, while it was"
4758,MACBETH,"smiling in her face, have plucked it from her breast, and dashed its"
4759,MACBETH,"brains out, if she had so sworn to do it, as he had sworn to perform"
4760,MACBETH,"that murder. Then she added, how practicable it was to lay the guilt"
4761,MACBETH,of the deed upon the drunken sleepy grooms. And with the valour of her
4762,MACBETH,"tongue she so chastised his sluggish resolutions, that he once more"
4763,MACBETH,summoned up courage to the bloody business.
4764,MACBETH,
4765,MACBETH,"So, taking the dagger in his hand, he softly stole in the dark to"
4766,MACBETH,"the room where Duncan lay; and as he went, he thought he saw another"
4767,MACBETH,"dagger in the air, with the handle towards him, and on the blade and"
4768,MACBETH,"at the point of it drops of blood: but when he tried to grasp at it,"
4769,MACBETH,"it was nothing but air, a mere phantasm proceeding from his own hot"
4770,MACBETH,and oppressed brain and the business he had in hand.
4771,MACBETH,
4772,MACBETH,"Getting rid of this fear, he entered the king's room, whom he"
4773,MACBETH,dispatched with one stroke of his dagger. Just as he had done the
4774,MACBETH,"murder, one of the grooms, who slept in the chamber, laughed in his"
4775,MACBETH,"sleep, and the other cried ""Murder,"" which woke them both: but they"
4776,MACBETH,"said a short prayer; one of them said, ""God bless us!"" and the other"
4777,MACBETH,"answered ""Amen;"" and addressed themselves to sleep again. Macbeth, who"
4778,MACBETH,"stood listening to them, tried to say ""Amen,"" when the fellow said"
4779,MACBETH,"""God bless us!"" but, though he had most need of a blessing, the word"
4780,MACBETH,"stuck in his throat, and he could not pronounce it."
4781,MACBETH,
4782,MACBETH,"Again he thought he heard a voice which cried, ""Sleep no more: Macbeth"
4783,MACBETH,"doth murder sleep, the innocent sleep, that nourishes life."" Still it"
4784,MACBETH,"cried, ""Sleep no more,"" to all the house. ""Glamis hath murdered sleep,"
4785,MACBETH,"and therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more, Macbeth shall sleep no"
4786,MACBETH,"more."""
4787,MACBETH,
4788,MACBETH,"With such horrible imaginations, Macbeth returned to his listening"
4789,MACBETH,"wife, who began to think he had failed of his purpose, and that the"
4790,MACBETH,"deed was somehow frustrated. He came in so distracted a state, that"
4791,MACBETH,"she reproached him with his want of firmness, and sent him to wash his"
4792,MACBETH,"hands of the blood which stained them, while she took his dagger, with"
4793,MACBETH,"purpose to stain the cheeks of the grooms with blood, to make it seem"
4794,MACBETH,their guilt.
4795,MACBETH,
4796,MACBETH,"Morning came, and with it the discovery of the murder, which could"
4797,MACBETH,not be concealed; and though Macbeth and his lady made great show of
4798,MACBETH,"grief, and the proofs against the grooms (the dagger being produced"
4799,MACBETH,against them and their faces smeared with blood) were sufficiently
4800,MACBETH,"strong, yet the entire suspicion fell upon Macbeth, whose inducements"
4801,MACBETH,to such a deed were so much more forcible than such poor silly grooms
4802,MACBETH,"could be supposed to have; and Duncan's two sons fled. Malcolm, the"
4803,MACBETH,"eldest, sought for refuge in the English court; and the youngest,"
4804,MACBETH,"Donalbain, made his escape to Ireland."
4805,MACBETH,
4806,MACBETH,"The king's sons, who should have succeeded him, having thus vacated"
4807,MACBETH,"the throne, Macbeth as next heir was crowned king, and thus the"
4808,MACBETH,prediction of the weird sisters was literally accomplished.
4809,MACBETH,
4810,MACBETH,"Though placed so high, Macbeth and his queen could not forget the"
4811,MACBETH,"prophecy of the weird sisters, that, though Macbeth should be king,"
4812,MACBETH,"yet not his children, but the children of Banquo, should be kings"
4813,MACBETH,"after him. The thought of this, and that they had defiled their hands"
4814,MACBETH,"with blood, and done so great crimes, only to place the posterity of"
4815,MACBETH,"Banquo upon the throne, so rankled within them, that they determined"
4816,MACBETH,"to put to death both Banquo and his son, to make void the predictions"
4817,MACBETH,"of the weird sisters, which in their own case had been so remarkably"
4818,MACBETH,brought to pass.
4819,MACBETH,
4820,MACBETH,"For this purpose they made a great supper, to which they invited"
4821,MACBETH,"all the chief thanes; and, among the rest, with marks of particular"
4822,MACBETH,"respect, Banquo and his son Fleance were invited. The way by which"
4823,MACBETH,"Banquo was to pass to the palace at night, was beset by murderers"
4824,MACBETH,"appointed by Macbeth, who stabbed Banquo; but in the scuffle Fleance"
4825,MACBETH,escaped. From that Fleance descended a race of monarchs who afterwards
4826,MACBETH,"filled the Scottish throne, ending with James the sixth of Scotland"
4827,MACBETH,"and the first of England, under whom the two crowns of England and"
4828,MACBETH,Scotland were united.
4829,MACBETH,
4830,MACBETH,"At supper the queen, whose manners were in the highest degree affable"
4831,MACBETH,"and royal, played the hostess with a gracefulness and attention which"
4832,MACBETH,"conciliated every one present, and Macbeth discoursed freely with his"
4833,MACBETH,"thanes and nobles, saying, that all that was honourable in the country"
4834,MACBETH,"was under his roof, if he had but his good friend Banquo present,"
4835,MACBETH,"whom yet he hoped he should rather have to chide for neglect, than to"
4836,MACBETH,"lament for any mischance. Just at these words the ghost of Banquo,"
4837,MACBETH,"whom he had caused to be murdered, entered the room, and placed"
4838,MACBETH,himself on the chair which Macbeth was about to occupy. Though Macbeth
4839,MACBETH,"was a bold man, and one that could have faced the devil without"
4840,MACBETH,"trembling, at this horrible sight his cheeks turned white with fear,"
4841,MACBETH,and he stood quite unmanned with his eyes fixed upon the ghost.
4842,MACBETH,"His queen and all the nobles, who saw nothing, but perceived him"
4843,MACBETH,"gazing (as they thought) upon an empty chair, took it for a fit of"
4844,MACBETH,"distraction; and she reproached him, whispering that it was but the"
4845,MACBETH,"same fancy which had made him see the dagger in the air, when he was"
4846,MACBETH,"about to kill Duncan. But Macbeth continued to see the ghost, and gave"
4847,MACBETH,"no heed to all they could say, while he addressed it with distracted"
4848,MACBETH,"words, yet so significant, that his queen, fearing the dreadful secret"
4849,MACBETH,"would be disclosed, in great haste dismissed the guests, excusing the"
4850,MACBETH,infirmity of Macbeth as a disorder he was often troubled with.
4851,MACBETH,
4852,MACBETH,To such dreadful fancies Macbeth was subject. His queen and he had
4853,MACBETH,"their sleeps afflicted with terrible dreams, and the blood of Banquo"
4854,MACBETH,"troubled them not more than the escape of Fleance, whom now they"
4855,MACBETH,"looked upon as father to a line of kings, who should keep their"
4856,MACBETH,posterity out of the throne. With these miserable thoughts they found
4857,MACBETH,"no peace, and Macbeth determined once more to seek out the weird"
4858,MACBETH,"sisters, and know from them the worst."
4859,MACBETH,
4860,MACBETH,"He sought them in a cave upon the heath, where they, who knew by"
4861,MACBETH,"foresight of his coming, were engaged in preparing their dreadful"
4862,MACBETH,"charms, by which they conjured up infernal spirits to reveal to them"
4863,MACBETH,"futurity. Their horrid ingredients were toads, bats, and serpents, the"
4864,MACBETH,"eye of a newt, and the tongue of a dog, the leg of a lizard, and the"
4865,MACBETH,"wing of the night-owl, the scale of a dragon, the tooth of a wolf, the"
4866,MACBETH,"maw of the ravenous salt-sea shark, the mummy of a witch, the root"
4867,MACBETH,of the poisonous hemlock (this to have effect must be digged in the
4868,MACBETH,"dark), the gall of a goat, and the liver of a Jew, with slips of the"
4869,MACBETH,"yew tree that roots itself in graves, and the finger of a dead child:"
4870,MACBETH,"all these were set on to boil in a great kettle, or cauldron, which,"
4871,MACBETH,"as fast as it grew too hot, was cooled with a baboon's blood: to these"
4872,MACBETH,"they poured in the blood of a sow that had eaten her young, and they"
4873,MACBETH,threw into the flame the grease that had sweaten from a murderer's
4874,MACBETH,gibbet. By these charms they bound the infernal spirits to answer
4875,MACBETH,their questions.
4876,MACBETH,
4877,MACBETH,"It was demanded of Macbeth, whether he would have his doubts resolved"
4878,MACBETH,"by them, or by their masters, the spirits. He, nothing daunted by the"
4879,MACBETH,"dreadful ceremonies which he saw, boldly answered, ""Where are they?"
4880,MACBETH,"let me see them."" And they called the spirits, which were three."
4881,MACBETH,"And the first arose in the likeness of an armed head, and he called"
4882,MACBETH,"Macbeth by name, and bid him beware of the thane of Fife; for which"
4883,MACBETH,caution Macbeth thanked him: for Macbeth had entertained a jealousy of
4884,MACBETH,"Macduff, the thane of Fife."
4885,MACBETH,
4886,MACBETH,"And the second spirit arose in the likeness of a bloody child, and he"
4887,MACBETH,"called Macbeth by name, and bid him have no fear, but laugh to scorn"
4888,MACBETH,"the power of man, for none of woman born should have power to hurt"
4889,MACBETH,"him: and he advised him to be bloody, bold, and resolute. ""Then live,"
4890,MACBETH,"Macduff!"" cried the king; ""what need I fear of thee? but yet I will"
4891,MACBETH,make assurance doubly sure. Thou shall not live; that I may tell
4892,MACBETH,"pale-hearted fear it lies, and sleep in spite of thunder."""
4893,MACBETH,
4894,MACBETH,"That spirit being dismissed, a third arose in the form of a child"
4895,MACBETH,"crowned, with a tree in his hand. He called Macbeth by name, and"
4896,MACBETH,"comforted him against conspiracies, saying, that he should never be"
4897,MACBETH,"vanquished, until the wood of Birnam to Dunsinane-Hill should come"
4898,MACBETH,"against him. ""Sweet bodements! good!"" cried Macbeth; ""who can unfix"
4899,MACBETH,"the forest, and move it from its earth-bound roots? I see I shall live"
4900,MACBETH,"the usual period of man's life, and not be cut off by a violent death."
4901,MACBETH,"But my heart throbs to know one thing. Tell me, if your art can tell"
4902,MACBETH,"so much, if Banquo's issue shall ever reign in this kingdom?"" Here"
4903,MACBETH,"the cauldron sank into the ground, and a noise of music was heard,"
4904,MACBETH,"and eight shadows, like kings, passed by Macbeth, and Banquo last,"
4905,MACBETH,"who bore a glass which shewed the figures of many more, and Banquo"
4906,MACBETH,"all bloody smiled upon Macbeth, and pointed to them; by which Macbeth"
4907,MACBETH,"knew, that these were the posterity of Banquo, who should reign after"
4908,MACBETH,"him in Scotland; and the witches, with a sound of soft music, and with"
4909,MACBETH,"dancing, making a shew of duty and welcome to Macbeth, vanished. And"
4910,MACBETH,from this time the thoughts of Macbeth were all bloody and dreadful.
4911,MACBETH,
4912,MACBETH,"The first thing he heard when he got out of the witches' cave, was,"
4913,MACBETH,"that Macduff, thane of Fife, had fled to England, to join the army"
4914,MACBETH,"which was forming against him under Malcolm, the eldest son of the"
4915,MACBETH,"late king, with intent to displace Macbeth, and set Malcolm, the right"
4916,MACBETH,"heir, upon the throne. Macbeth, stung with rage, set upon the castle"
4917,MACBETH,"of Macduff, and put his wife and children, whom the thane had left"
4918,MACBETH,"behind, to the sword, and extended the slaughter to all who claimed"
4919,MACBETH,the least relationship to Macduff.
4920,MACBETH,
4921,MACBETH,These and such-like deeds alienated the minds of all his chief
4922,MACBETH,"nobility from him. Such as could, fled to join with Malcolm and"
4923,MACBETH,"Macduff, who were now approaching with a powerful army which they"
4924,MACBETH,had raised in England; and the rest secretly wished success to their
4925,MACBETH,"arms, though for fear of Macbeth they could take no active part. His"
4926,MACBETH,"recruits went on slowly. Every body hated the tyrant, nobody loved"
4927,MACBETH,"or honoured him, but all suspected him, and he began to envy the"
4928,MACBETH,"condition of Duncan whom he had murdered, who slept soundly in his"
4929,MACBETH,"grave, against whom treason had done its worst: steel nor poison,"
4930,MACBETH,"domestic malice nor foreign levies, could hurt him any longer."
4931,MACBETH,
4932,MACBETH,"While these things were acting, the queen, who had been the sole"
4933,MACBETH,"partner in his wickedness, in whose bosom he could sometimes seek a"
4934,MACBETH,momentary repose from those terrible dreams which afflicted them both
4935,MACBETH,"nightly, died, it is supposed by her own hands, unable to bear the"
4936,MACBETH,"remorse of guilt, and public hate; by which event he was left alone,"
4937,MACBETH,"without a soul to love or care for him, or a friend to whom he could"
4938,MACBETH,confide his wicked purposes.
4939,MACBETH,
4940,MACBETH,"He grew careless of life, and wished for death; but the near approach"
4941,MACBETH,"of Malcolm's army roused in him what remained of his ancient courage,"
4942,MACBETH,"and he determined to die (as he expressed it) ""with armour on his"
4943,MACBETH,"back."" Besides this, the hollow promises of the witches had filled him"
4944,MACBETH,"with false confidence, and he remembered the sayings of the spirits,"
4945,MACBETH,"that none of woman born was to hurt him, and that he was never to be"
4946,MACBETH,"vanquished till Birnam wood should come to Dunsinane, which he thought"
4947,MACBETH,"could never be. So he shut himself up in his castle, whose impregnable"
4948,MACBETH,strength was such as defied a siege: here he sullenly waited the
4949,MACBETH,"approach of Malcolm. When, upon a day, there came a messenger to him,"
4950,MACBETH,"pale and shaking with fear, almost unable to report that which he had"
4951,MACBETH,"seen: for he averred, that as he stood upon his watch on the hill, he"
4952,MACBETH,"looked towards Birnam, and to his thinking the wood began to move!"
4953,MACBETH,"""Liar and slave,"" cried Macbeth; ""if thou speakest false, thou shalt"
4954,MACBETH,"hang alive upon the next tree, till famine end thee. If thy tale"
4955,MACBETH,"be true, I care not if thou dost as much by me:"" for Macbeth now"
4956,MACBETH,"began to faint in resolution, and to doubt the equivocal speeches"
4957,MACBETH,"of the spirits. He was not to fear, till Birnam wood should come to"
4958,MACBETH,"Dunsinane: and now a wood did move! ""However,"" said he, ""if this which"
4959,MACBETH,"he avouches be true, let us arm and out. There is no flying hence,"
4960,MACBETH,"nor staying here. I begin to be weary of the sun, and wish my life"
4961,MACBETH,"at an end."" With these desperate speeches he sallied forth upon the"
4962,MACBETH,"besiegers, who had now come up to the castle."
4963,MACBETH,
4964,MACBETH,"The strange appearance, which had given the messenger an idea of a"
4965,MACBETH,"wood moving, is easily solved. When the besieging army marched through"
4966,MACBETH,"the wood of Birnam, Malcolm, like a skilful general, instructed his"
4967,MACBETH,"soldiers to hew down every one a bough and bear it before him, by"
4968,MACBETH,way of concealing the true numbers of his host. This marching of
4969,MACBETH,the soldiers with boughs had at a distance the appearance which had
4970,MACBETH,frightened the messenger. Thus were the words of the spirit brought to
4971,MACBETH,"pass, in a sense different from that in which Macbeth had understood"
4972,MACBETH,"them, and one great hold of his confidence was gone."
4973,MACBETH,
4974,MACBETH,"And now a severe skirmishing took place, in which Macbeth, though"
4975,MACBETH,"feebly supported by those who called themselves his friends, but in"
4976,MACBETH,reality hated the tyrant and inclined to the party of Malcolm and
4977,MACBETH,"Macduff, yet fought with the extreme of rage and valour, cutting to"
4978,MACBETH,"pieces all who were opposed to him, till he came to where Macduff was"
4979,MACBETH,"fighting. Seeing Macduff, and remembering the caution of the spirit"
4980,MACBETH,"who had counselled him to avoid Macduff above all men, he would have"
4981,MACBETH,"turned, but Macduff, who had been seeking him through the whole fight,"
4982,MACBETH,"opposed his turning, and a fierce contest ensued; Macduff giving him"
4983,MACBETH,"many foul reproaches for the murder of his wife and children. Macbeth,"
4984,MACBETH,"whose soul was charged enough with blood of that family already, would"
4985,MACBETH,"still have declined the combat; but Macduff still urged him to it,"
4986,MACBETH,"calling him tyrant, murderer, hell-hound, and villain."
4987,MACBETH,
4988,MACBETH,"Then Macbeth remembered the words of the spirit, how none of woman"
4989,MACBETH,"born should hurt him; and smiling confidently he said to Macduff,"
4990,MACBETH,"""Thou losest thy labour, Macduff. As easily thou mayest impress the"
4991,MACBETH,"air with thy sword, as make me vulnerable. I bear a charmed life,"
4992,MACBETH,"which must not yield to one of woman born."""
4993,MACBETH,
4994,MACBETH,"""Despair thy charm,"" said Macduff, ""and let that lying spirit whom"
4995,MACBETH,"thou hast served, tell thee, that Macduff was never born of woman,"
4996,MACBETH,"never as the ordinary manner of men is to be born, but was untimely"
4997,MACBETH,"taken from his mother."""
4998,MACBETH,
4999,MACBETH,"""Accursed be the tongue which tells me so,"" said the trembling"
5000,MACBETH,"Macbeth, who felt his last hold of confidence give way; ""and let never"
5001,MACBETH,man in future believe the lying equivocations of witches and juggling
5002,MACBETH,"spirits, who deceive us in words which have double senses, and while"
5003,MACBETH,"they keep their promise literally, disappoint our hopes with a"
5004,MACBETH,"different meaning. I will not fight with thee."""
5005,MACBETH,
5006,MACBETH,"""Then, live!"" said the scornful Macduff; ""we will have a show of thee,"
5007,MACBETH,"as men shew monsters, and a painted board, on which shall be written,"
5008,MACBETH,"Here men may see the tyrant!"""
5009,MACBETH,
5010,MACBETH,"""Never,"" said Macbeth, whose courage returned with despair; ""I will"
5011,MACBETH,"not live to kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet, and to be"
5012,MACBETH,baited with the curses of the rabble. Though Birnam wood be come to
5013,MACBETH,"Dunsinane, and thou opposed to me who wast never born of woman, yet"
5014,MACBETH,"will I try the last."" With these frantic words he threw himself upon"
5015,MACBETH,"Macduff, who, after a severe struggle in the end overcame him, and"
5016,MACBETH,"cutting off his head, made a present of it to the young and lawful"
5017,MACBETH,"king, Malcolm; who took upon him the government which by the"
5018,MACBETH,"machinations of the usurper he had so long been deprived of, and"
5019,MACBETH,ascended the throne of Duncan the Meek amid the acclamations of the
5020,MACBETH,nobles and the people.

5027,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,(_By Mary Lamb_)
5028,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5029,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5030,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram, count of Rossilion, had newly come to his title and estate,"
5031,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,by the death of his father. The king of France loved the father of
5032,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram, and when he heard of his death, he sent for his son to come"
5033,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"immediately to his royal court in Paris; intending, for the friendship"
5034,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"he bore the late count, to grace young Bertram with his especial"
5035,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,favour and protection.
5036,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5037,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram was living with his mother, the widowed countess, when Lafeu,"
5038,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"an old lord of the French court, came to conduct Bertram to the king."
5039,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"The king of France was an absolute monarch, and the invitation to"
5040,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"court was in the form of a royal mandate, or positive command, which"
5041,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,no subject of what high dignity soever might disobey; therefore though
5042,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"the countess, in parting with this dear son, seemed a second time"
5043,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"to bury her husband, whose loss she had so lately mourned, yet she"
5044,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"dared not to keep him a single day, but gave instant orders for his"
5045,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"departure. Lafeu, who came to fetch him, tried to comfort the countess"
5046,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"for the loss of her late lord, and her son's sudden absence; and he"
5047,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"said, in a courtier's flattering manner, that the king was so kind a"
5048,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"prince, she would find in his majesty a husband, and that he would be"
5049,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,a father to her son: meaning only that the good king would befriend
5050,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,the fortunes of Bertram. Lafeu told the countess that the king had
5051,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"fallen into a sad malady, which was pronounced by his physicians to be"
5052,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,incurable. The lady expressed great sorrow on hearing this account of
5053,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"the king's ill health, and said, she wished the father of Helena (a"
5054,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"young gentlewoman who was present in attendance upon her) were living,"
5055,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,for that she doubted not he could have cured his majesty of his
5056,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"disease. And she told Lafeu something of the history of Helena, saying"
5057,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"she was the only daughter of the famous physician Gerard de Narbon,"
5058,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,and that he had recommended his daughter to her care when he was
5059,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"dying, so that since his death she had taken Helena under her"
5060,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,protection; then the countess praised the virtuous disposition and
5061,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"excellent qualities of Helena, saying she inherited these virtues from"
5062,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"her worthy father. While she was speaking, Helena wept in sad and"
5063,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"mournful silence, which made the countess gently reprove her for too"
5064,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,much grieving for her father's death.
5065,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5066,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,Bertram now bade his mother farewel. The countess parted with this
5067,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"dear son with tears and many blessings, and commended him to the care"
5068,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"of Lafeu, saying, ""Good my lord, advise him, for he is an unseasoned"
5069,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"courtier."""
5070,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5071,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram's last words were spoken to Helena, but they were words of"
5072,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"mere civility, wishing her happiness; and he concluded his short"
5073,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"farewel to her with saying, ""Be comfortable to my mother your"
5074,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"mistress, and make much of her."""
5075,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5076,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Helena had long loved Bertram, and when she wept in sad and mournful"
5077,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"silence, the tears she shed were not for Gerard de Narbon. Helena"
5078,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"loved her father, but in the present feeling of a deeper love, the"
5079,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"object of which she was about to lose, she had forgotten the very form"
5080,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"and features of her dead father, her imagination presenting no image"
5081,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,to her mind but Bertram's.
5082,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5083,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Helena had long loved Bertram, yet she always remembered that he"
5084,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"was the count of Rossilion, descended from the most ancient family"
5085,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,in France. She of humble birth. Her parents of no note at all. His
5086,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,ancestors all noble. And therefore she looked up to the high-born
5087,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram, as to her master and to her dear lord, and dared not form"
5088,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"any wish but to live his servant, and so living to die his vassal. So"
5089,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,great the distance seemed to her between his height of dignity and her
5090,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"lowly fortunes, that she would say, ""It were all one that I should"
5091,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"love a bright peculiar star and think to wed it, Bertram is so far"
5092,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"above me."""
5093,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5094,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram's absence filled her eyes with tears, and her heart with"
5095,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"sorrow; for though she loved without hope, yet it was a pretty comfort"
5096,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"to her to see him every hour, and Helena would sit and look upon his"
5097,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"dark eye, his arched brow, and the curls of his fine hair, till she"
5098,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"seemed to draw his portrait on the tablet of her heart, that heart too"
5099,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,capable of retaining the memory of every line in the features of that
5100,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,loved face.
5101,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5102,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Gerard de Narbon, when he died, left her no other portion than some"
5103,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"prescriptions of rare and well proved virtue, which by deep study and"
5104,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"long experience in medicine, he had collected as sovereign and almost"
5105,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,infallible remedies. Among the rest there was one set down as an
5106,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,approved medicine for the disease under which Lafeu said the king at
5107,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"that time languished; and when Helena heard of the king's complaint,"
5108,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"she, who till now had been so humble and so hopeless, formed an"
5109,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"ambitious project in her mind to go herself to Paris, and undertake"
5110,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,the cure of the king. But though Helena was the possessor of this
5111,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"choice prescription, it was unlikely, as the king as well as his"
5112,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"physicians were of opinion that his disease was incurable, that they"
5113,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"would give credit to a poor unlearned virgin, if she should offer"
5114,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"to perform a cure. The firm hopes that Helena had of succeeding, if"
5115,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"she might be permitted to make the trial, seemed more than even her"
5116,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"father's skill warranted, though he was the most famous physician of"
5117,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,his time; for she felt a strong faith that this good medicine was
5118,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"sanctified by all the luckiest stars in heaven, to be the legacy that"
5119,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"should advance her fortune, even to the high dignity of being count"
5120,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,Rossilion's wife.
5121,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5122,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram had not been long gone, when the countess was informed by her"
5123,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"steward, that he had overheard Helena talking to herself, and that he"
5124,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"understood from some words she uttered, she was in love with Bertram,"
5125,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,and had thought of following him to Paris. The countess dismissed
5126,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"the steward with thanks, and desired him to tell Helena she wished"
5127,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,to speak with her. What she had just heard of Helena brought the
5128,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"remembrance of days long past into the mind of the countess, those"
5129,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,days probably when her love for Bertram's father first began; and she
5130,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"said to herself, ""Even so it was with me when I was young. Love is a"
5131,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"thorn that belongs to the rose of youth; for in the season of youth,"
5132,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"if ever we are nature's children, these faults are ours, though then"
5133,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"we think not they are faults."" While the countess was thus meditating"
5134,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"on the loving errors of her own youth, Helena entered, and she said"
5135,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"to her, ""Helena, you know I am a mother to you."" Helena replied, ""You"
5136,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"are my honourable mistress."" ""You are my daughter,"" said the countess"
5137,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"again: ""I say I am your mother. Why do you start and look pale at"
5138,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"my words?"" With looks of alarm and confused thoughts, fearing the"
5139,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"countess suspected her love, Helena still replied, ""Pardon me, madam,"
5140,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"you are not my mother; the count Rossilion cannot be my brother, nor"
5141,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"I your daughter."" ""Yet, Helena,"" said the countess, ""you might be my"
5142,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"daughter-in-law; and I am afraid that is what you mean to be, the"
5143,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"words _mother_ and _daughter_ so disturb you. Helena, do you love my"
5144,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"son?"" ""Good madam, pardon me,"" said the affrighted Helena. Again the"
5145,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"countess repeated her question, ""Do you love my son?"" ""Do not you"
5146,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"love him, madam?"" said Helena. The countess replied, ""Give me not"
5147,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"this evasive answer, Helena. Come, come, disclose the state of your"
5148,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"affections, for your love has to the full appeared."" Helena on her"
5149,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"knees now owned her love, and with shame and terror implored the"
5150,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,pardon of her noble mistress; and with words expressive of the sense
5151,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"she had of the inequality between their fortunes, she protested"
5152,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram did not know she loved him, comparing her humble unaspiring"
5153,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"love to a poor Indian, who adores the sun, that looks upon his"
5154,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,worshipper but knows of him no more. The countess asked Helena if
5155,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,she had not lately an intent to go to Paris? Helena owned the design
5156,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"she had formed in her mind, when she heard Lafeu speak of the king's"
5157,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"illness. ""This was your motive for wishing to go to Paris,"" said the"
5158,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"countess, ""was it? Speak truly."" Helena honestly answered, ""My lord"
5159,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"your son made me to think of this; else Paris, and the medicine, and"
5160,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"the king, had from the conversation of my thoughts been absent then."""
5161,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,The countess heard the whole of this confession without saying a word
5162,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"either of approval or of blame, but she strictly questioned Helena as"
5163,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,to the probability of the medicine being useful to the king. She found
5164,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"that it was the most prized by Gerard de Narbon of all he possessed,"
5165,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,and that he had given it to his daughter on his death-bed; and
5166,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,remembering the solemn promise she had made at that awful hour in
5167,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"regard to this young maid, whose destiny, and the life of the king"
5168,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"himself, seemed to depend on the execution of a project (which though"
5169,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"conceived by the fond suggestions of a loving maiden's thoughts, the"
5170,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,countess knew not but it might be the unseen workings of Providence to
5171,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"bring to pass the recovery of the king, and to lay the foundation of"
5172,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"the future fortunes of Gerard de Narbon's daughter), free leave she"
5173,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"gave to Helena to pursue her own way, and generously furnished her"
5174,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"with ample means and suitable attendants, and Helena set out for"
5175,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Paris with the blessings of the countess, and her kindest wishes for"
5176,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,her success.
5177,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5178,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Helena arrived at Paris, and by the assistance of her friend the old"
5179,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"lord Lafeu, she obtained an audience of the king. She had still many"
5180,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"difficulties to encounter, for the king was not easily prevailed on to"
5181,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,try the medicine offered him by this fair young doctor. But she told
5182,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,him she was Gerard de Narbon's daughter (with whose fame the king
5183,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"was well acquainted), and she offered the precious medicine as the"
5184,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,darling treasure which contained the essence of all her father's long
5185,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"experience and skill, and she boldly engaged to forfeit her life, if"
5186,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,it failed to restore his majesty to perfect health in the space of two
5187,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"days. The king at length consented to try it, and in two days time"
5188,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,Helena was to lose her life if the king did not recover; but if she
5189,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"succeeded, he promised to give her the choice of any man throughout"
5190,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,all France (the princes only excepted) whom she could like for an
5191,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"husband; the choice of an husband being the fee Helena demanded, if"
5192,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,she cured the king of his disease.
5193,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5194,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,Helena did not deceive herself in the hope she conceived of the
5195,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"efficacy of her father's medicine. Before two days were at an end, the"
5196,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"king was restored to perfect health, and he assembled all the young"
5197,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"noblemen of his court together, in order to confer the promised reward"
5198,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,of an husband upon his fair physician; and he desired Helena to look
5199,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"round on this youthful parcel of noble bachelors, and choose her"
5200,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"husband. Helena was not slow to make her choice, for among these young"
5201,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"lords she saw the count Rossilion, and turning to Bertram, she said,"
5202,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"""This is the man. I dare not say, my lord, I take you, but I give"
5203,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"me and my service ever whilst I live into your guiding power."" ""Why"
5204,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"then,"" said the king, ""young Bertram, take her; she is your wife."""
5205,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,Bertram did not hesitate to declare his dislike to this present of
5206,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"the king's of the self-offered Helena, who, he said, was a poor"
5207,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"physician's daughter, bred at his father's charge, and now living a"
5208,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,dependent on his mother's bounty. Helena heard him speak these words
5209,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"of rejection and of scorn, and she said to the king, ""That you are"
5210,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"well, my lord, I am glad. Let the rest go."" But the king would not"
5211,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,suffer his royal command to be so slighted; for the power of bestowing
5212,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,their nobles in marriage was one of the many privileges of the kings
5213,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"of France; and that same day Bertram was married to Helena, a forced"
5214,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"and uneasy marriage to Bertram, and of no promising hope to the poor"
5215,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"lady, who, though she gained the noble husband she had hazarded her"
5216,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"life to obtain, seemed to have won but a splendid blank, her husband's"
5217,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,love not being a gift in the power of the king of France to bestow.
5218,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5219,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Helena was no sooner married, than she was desired by Bertram to apply"
5220,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,to the king for him for leave of absence from court; and when she
5221,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"brought him the king's permission for his departure, Bertram told her"
5222,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"that as he was not prepared for this sudden marriage, it had much"
5223,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"unsettled him, and therefore she must not wonder at the course he"
5224,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"should pursue. If Helena wondered not, she grieved, when she found"
5225,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,it was his intention to leave her. He ordered her to go home to his
5226,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"mother. When Helena heard this unkind command, she replied, ""Sir, I"
5227,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"can nothing say to this, but that I am your most obedient servant, and"
5228,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"shall ever with true observance seek to eke out that desert, wherein"
5229,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"my homely stars have failed to equal my great fortunes."" But this"
5230,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,humble speech of Helena's did not at all move the haughty Bertram to
5231,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"pity his gentle wife, and he parted from her without even the common"
5232,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,civility of a kind farewel.
5233,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5234,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,Back to the countess then Helena returned. She had accomplished the
5235,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"purport of her journey, she had preserved the life of the king, and"
5236,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"she had wedded her heart's dear lord, the count Rossilion; but she"
5237,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"returned back a dejected lady to her noble mother-in-law, and as soon"
5238,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"as she entered the house, she received a letter from Bertram which"
5239,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,almost broke her heart.
5240,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5241,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"The good countess received her with a cordial welcome, as if she"
5242,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"had been her son's own choice, and a lady of a high degree, and she"
5243,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"spoke kind words, to comfort her for the unkind neglect of Bertram"
5244,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,in sending his wife home on her bridal day alone. But this gracious
5245,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"reception failed to cheer the sad mind of Helena, and she said,"
5246,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"""Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone."" She then read these words out"
5247,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,of Bertram's letter: _When you can get the ring from my finger which
5248,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"never shall come off, then call me husband, but in such a Then I write"
5249,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"a Never_. ""This is a dreadful sentence!"" said Helena. The countess"
5250,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"begged her to have patience, and said, now Bertram was gone, she"
5251,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"should be her child, and that she deserved a lord, that twenty such"
5252,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"rude boys as Bertram might tend upon, and hourly call her mistress."
5253,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,But in vain by respectful condescension and kind flattery this
5254,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,matchless mother tried to soothe the sorrows of her daughter-in-law.
5255,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Helena still kept her eyes fixt upon the letter, and cried out in an"
5256,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"agony of grief, _Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France_. The"
5257,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"countess asked her if she found those words in the letter? ""Yes,"
5258,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"madam,"" was all poor Helena could answer."
5259,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5260,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,The next morning Helena was missing. She left a letter to be delivered
5261,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"to the countess after she was gone, to acquaint her with the reason of"
5262,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"her sudden absence: in this letter she informed her, that she was so"
5263,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,much grieved at having driven Bertram from his native country and his
5264,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"home, that to atone for her offence she had undertaken a pilgrimage to"
5265,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"the shrine of St. Jaques le Grand, and concluded with requesting the"
5266,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,countess to inform her son that the wife he so hated had left his
5267,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,house for ever.
5268,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5269,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram, when he left Paris, went to Florence, and there became an"
5270,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"officer in the duke of Florence's army, and after a successful war, in"
5271,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"which he distinguished himself by many brave actions, Bertram received"
5272,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"letters from his mother, containing the acceptable tidings that Helena"
5273,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"would no more disturb him; and he was preparing to return home, when"
5274,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Helena herself, clad in her pilgrim's weeds, arrived at the city of"
5275,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,Florence.
5276,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5277,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,Florence was a city through which the pilgrims used to pass on their
5278,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"way to St. Jaques le Grand; and when Helena arrived at this city, she"
5279,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"heard that a hospitable widow dwelt there, who used to receive into"
5280,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,her house the female pilgrims that were going to visit the shrine
5281,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"of that saint, giving them lodging and kind entertainment. To this"
5282,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"good lady therefore Helena went, and the widow gave her a courteous"
5283,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"welcome, and invited her to see whatever was curious in that famous"
5284,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"city, and told her that if she would like to see the duke's army,"
5285,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"she would take her where she might have a full view of it. ""And you"
5286,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"will see a countryman of yours,"" said the widow; ""his name is count"
5287,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Rossilion, who has done worthy service in the duke's wars."" Helena"
5288,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"wanted no second invitation, when she found Bertram was to make part"
5289,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,of the show. She accompanied her hostess; and a sad and mournful
5290,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,pleasure it was to her to look once more upon her dear husband's face.
5291,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"""Is he not a handsome man?"" said the widow. ""I like him well,"" replied"
5292,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Helena, with great truth. All the way they walked, the talkative"
5293,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,widow's discourse was all of Bertram: she told Helena the story of
5294,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram's marriage, and how he had deserted the poor lady his wife,"
5295,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,and entered into the duke's army to avoid living with her. To this
5296,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"account of her own misfortunes Helena patiently listened, and when it"
5297,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"was ended, the history of Bertram was not yet done, for then the widow"
5298,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"began another tale, every word of which sunk deep into the mind of"
5299,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,Helena; for the story she now told was of Bertram's love for her
5300,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,daughter.
5301,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5302,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Though Bertram did not like the marriage forced on him by the king, it"
5303,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"seems he was not insensible to love, for since he had been stationed"
5304,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"with the army at Florence, he had fallen in love with Diana, a fair"
5305,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"young gentlewoman, the daughter of this widow who was Helena's"
5306,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"hostess; and every night, with music of all sorts, and songs composed"
5307,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"in praise of Diana's beauty, he would come under her window, and"
5308,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,solicit her love: and all his suit to her was that she would permit
5309,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,him to visit her by stealth after the family were retired to rest; but
5310,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Diana would by no means be persuaded to grant this improper request,"
5311,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"nor give any encouragement to his suit, knowing him to be a married"
5312,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,man; for Diana had been brought up under the counsels of a prudent
5313,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"mother, who, though she was now in reduced circumstances, was"
5314,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"well-born, and descended from the noble family of the Capulets."
5315,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5316,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"All this the good lady related to Helena, highly praising the virtuous"
5317,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"principles of her discreet daughter, which she said were entirely"
5318,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,owing to the excellent education and good advice she had given her;
5319,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"and she farther said, that Bertram had been particularly importunate"
5320,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"with Diana to admit him to the visit he so much desired that night,"
5321,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,because he was going to leave Florence early the next morning.
5322,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5323,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,Though it grieved Helena to hear of Bertram's love for the widow's
5324,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"daughter, yet from this story the ardent mind of Helena conceived a"
5325,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,project (nothing discouraged at the ill success of her former one)
5326,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"to recover her truant lord. She disclosed to the widow, that she was"
5327,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Helena, the deserted wife of Bertram, and requested that her kind"
5328,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,hostess and her daughter would suffer this visit from Bertram to take
5329,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"place, and allow her to pass herself upon Bertram for Diana; telling"
5330,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"them, her chief motive for desiring to have this secret meeting with"
5331,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"her husband, was to get a ring from him, which he had said if ever she"
5332,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"was in possession of, he would acknowledge her as his wife."
5333,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5334,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"The widow and her daughter promised to assist her in this affair,"
5335,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"partly moved by pity for this unhappy forsaken wife, and partly won"
5336,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"over to her interest by the promises of reward which Helena made them,"
5337,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,giving them a purse of money in earnest of her future favour. In the
5338,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"course of that day Helena caused information to be sent to Bertram,"
5339,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"that she was dead, hoping that when he thought himself free to make a"
5340,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"second choice by the news of her death, he would offer marriage to her"
5341,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,in her feigned character of Diana. And if she could obtain the ring
5342,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"and this promise too, she doubted not she should make some future good"
5343,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,come of it.
5344,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5345,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"In the evening, after it was dark, Bertram was admitted into Diana's"
5346,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"chamber, and Helena was there ready to receive him. The flattering"
5347,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,compliments and love-discourse he addressed to Helena were precious
5348,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"sounds to her, though she knew they were meant for Diana; and Bertram"
5349,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"was so well pleased with her, that he made her a solemn promise to"
5350,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"be her husband, and to love her for ever; which she hoped would be"
5351,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"prophetic of a real affection, when he should know it was his own"
5352,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"wife, the despised Helena, whose conversation had so delighted him."
5353,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5354,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram never knew how sensible a lady Helena was, else perhaps he"
5355,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"would not have been so regardless of her; and seeing her every day, he"
5356,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"had entirely overlooked her beauty, a face we are accustomed to see"
5357,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,constantly losing the effect which is caused by the first sight either
5358,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,of beauty or of plainness; and of her understanding it was impossible
5359,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"he should judge, because she felt such reverence, mixed with her love"
5360,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"for him, that she was always silent in his presence; but now that her"
5361,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"future fate, and the happy ending of all her love-projects, seemed to"
5362,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,depend on her leaving a favourable impression on the mind of Bertram
5363,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"from this night's interview, she exerted all her wit to please him;"
5364,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,and the simple graces of her lively conversation and the endearing
5365,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"sweetness of her manners so charmed Bertram, that he vowed she should"
5366,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,be his wife. Helena begged the ring from off his finger as a token of
5367,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"his regard, and he gave it to her; and in return for this ring, which"
5368,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"it was of such importance to her to possess, she gave him another"
5369,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"ring, which was one the king had made her a present of. Before it was"
5370,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"light in the morning, she sent Bertram away; and he immediately set"
5371,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,out on his journey towards his mother's house.
5372,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5373,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Helena prevailed on the widow and Diana to accompany her to Paris,"
5374,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,their farther assistance being necessary to the full accomplishment
5375,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"of the plan she had formed. When they arrived there, they found the"
5376,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"king was gone upon a visit to the countess of Rossilion, and Helena"
5377,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,followed the king with all the speed she could make.
5378,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5379,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"The king was still in perfect health, and his gratitude to her who had"
5380,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"been the means of his recovery was so lively in his mind, that the"
5381,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"moment he saw the countess of Rossilion, he began to talk of Helena,"
5382,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,calling her a precious jewel that was lost by the folly of her son;
5383,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"but seeing the subject distressed the countess, who sincerely lamented"
5384,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"the death of Helena, he said, ""My good lady, I have forgiven and"
5385,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"forgotten all."" But the good-natured old Lafeu, who was present, and"
5386,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,could not bear that the memory of his favourite Helena should be so
5387,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"lightly passed over, said, ""This I must say, the young lord did great"
5388,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"offence to his majesty, his mother, and his lady; but to himself he"
5389,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"did the greatest wrong of all, for he has lost a wife whose beauty"
5390,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"astonished all eyes, whose words took all ears captive, whose deep"
5391,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"perfection made all hearts wish to serve her."" The king said,"
5392,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"""Praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear. Well--call him"
5393,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"hither;"" meaning Bertram, who now presented himself before the king:"
5394,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"and, on his expressing deep sorrow for the injuries he had done to"
5395,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Helena, the king, for his dead father's and his admirable mother's"
5396,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"sake, pardoned him, and restored him once more to his favour. But the"
5397,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"gracious countenance of the king was soon changed towards him, for he"
5398,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,perceived that Bertram wore the very ring upon his finger which he had
5399,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,given to Helena; and he well remembered that Helena had called all
5400,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"the saints in heaven to witness she would never part with that ring,"
5401,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,unless she sent it to the king himself upon some great disaster
5402,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"befalling her; and Bertram, on the king's questioning him how he came"
5403,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"by the ring, told an improbable story of a lady throwing it to him out"
5404,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"of a window, and denied ever having seen Helena since the day of their"
5405,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"marriage. The king, knowing Bertram's dislike to his wife, feared he"
5406,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"had destroyed her; and he ordered his guards to seize Bertram, saying,"
5407,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"""I am wrapt in dismal thinking, for I fear the life of Helena was"
5408,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"foully snatched."" At this moment Diana and her mother entered, and"
5409,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"presented a petition to the king, wherein they begged his majesty to"
5410,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"exert his royal power to compel Bertram to marry Diana, he having made"
5411,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"her a solemn promise of marriage. Bertram, fearing the king's anger,"
5412,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"denied he had made any such promise, and then Diana produced the ring"
5413,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,(which Helena had put into her hands) to confirm the truth of her
5414,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"words; and she said that she had given Bertram the ring he then wore,"
5415,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"in exchange for that, at the time he vowed to marry her. On hearing"
5416,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"this, the king ordered the guards to seize her also; and her account"
5417,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"of the ring differing from Bertram's, the king's suspicions were"
5418,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"confirmed; and he said, if they did not confess how they came by this"
5419,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"ring of Helena's, they should be both put to death. Diana requested"
5420,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,her mother might be permitted to fetch the jeweller of whom she bought
5421,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"the ring, which being granted, the widow went out, and presently"
5422,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,returned leading in Helena herself.
5423,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5424,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"The good countess, who in silent grief had beheld her son's danger,"
5425,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,and had even dreaded that the suspicion of his having destroyed his
5426,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"wife might possibly be true, finding her dear Helena, whom she loved"
5427,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"with even a maternal affection, was still living, felt a delight she"
5428,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"was hardly able to support; and the king, scarce believing for joy"
5429,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"that it was Helena, said, ""Is this indeed the wife of Bertram that I"
5430,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"see?"" Helena, feeling herself yet an unacknowledged wife, replied,"
5431,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"""No, my good lord, it is but the shadow of a wife you see, the name"
5432,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"and not the thing."" Bertram cried out, ""Both, both! O pardon!"" ""O my"
5433,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"lord,"" said Helena, ""when I personated this fair maid, I found you"
5434,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"wondrous kind; and look, here is your letter!"" reading to him in a"
5435,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"joyful tone those words, which she had once repeated so sorrowfully,"
5436,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"_When from my finger you can get this ring_--""This is done, it was"
5437,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"to me you gave the ring. Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?"""
5438,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Bertram replied, ""If you can make it plain that you were the lady I"
5439,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"talked with that night, I will love you dearly, ever, ever dearly."""
5440,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"This was no difficult task, for the widow and Diana came with Helena"
5441,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,purposely to prove this fact; and the king was so well pleased with
5442,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"Diana, for the friendly assistance she had rendered the dear lady he"
5443,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"so truly valued for the service she had done him, that he promised her"
5444,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,also a noble husband: Helena's history giving him a hint that it was a
5445,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,suitable reward for kings to bestow upon fair ladies when they perform
5446,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,notable services.
5447,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
5448,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,Thus Helena at last found that her father's legacy was indeed
5449,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,sanctified by the luckiest stars in heaven; for she was now the
5450,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"beloved wife of her dear Bertram, the daughter-in-law of her noble"
5451,ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,"mistress, and herself the countess of Rossilion."

5457,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5458,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,(_By Mary Lamb_)
5459,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5460,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5461,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Katherine, the shrew, was the eldest daughter of Baptista, a rich"
5462,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,gentleman of Padua. She was a lady of such an ungovernable spirit and
5463,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"fiery temper, such a loud-tongued scold, that she was known in Padua"
5464,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"by no other name than Katherine the Shrew. It seemed very unlikely,"
5465,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"indeed impossible, that any gentleman would ever be found who would"
5466,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"venture to marry this lady, and therefore Baptista was much blamed"
5467,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,for deferring his consent to many excellent offers that were made to
5468,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"her gentle sister Bianca, putting off all Bianca's suitors with this"
5469,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"excuse, that when the eldest sister was fairly off his hands, they"
5470,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,should have free leave to address young Bianca.
5471,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5472,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"It happened however that a gentleman, named Petruchio, came to Padua,"
5473,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"purposely to look out for a wife, who, nothing discouraged by these"
5474,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"reports of Katherine's temper, and hearing she was rich and handsome,"
5475,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"resolved upon marrying this famous termagant, and taming her into"
5476,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,a meek and manageable wife. And truly none was so fit to set about
5477,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"this herculean labour as Petruchio, whose spirit was as high as"
5478,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Katherine's, and he was a witty and most happy-tempered humourist, and"
5479,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"withal so wise, and of such a true judgment, that he well knew how"
5480,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"to feign a passionate and furious deportment, when his spirits were"
5481,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,so calm that he himself could have laughed merrily at his own angry
5482,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"feigning, for his natural temper was careless and easy; the boisterous"
5483,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,airs he assumed when he became the husband of Katherine being but
5484,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"in sport, or, more properly speaking, affected by his excellent"
5485,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"discernment, as the only means to overcome in her own way the"
5486,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,passionate ways of the furious Katherine.
5487,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5488,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"A courting then Petruchio went to Katherine the shrew, and first of"
5489,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"all he applied to Baptista, her father, for leave to woo his _gentle"
5490,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"daughter_ Katherine, as Petruchio called her, saying archly, that"
5491,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"having heard of her bashful modesty and mild behaviour, he had"
5492,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"come from Verona to solicit her love. Her father, though he wished"
5493,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"her married, was forced to confess Katherine would ill answer this"
5494,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"character, it being soon apparent of what manner of gentleness she"
5495,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"was composed, for her music-master rushed into the room to complain"
5496,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"that the gentle Katherine, his pupil, had broken his head with her"
5497,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"lute, for presuming to find fault with her performance; which, when"
5498,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Petruchio heard, he said, ""It is a brave wench; I love her more than"
5499,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"ever, and long to have some chat with her;"" and hurrying the old"
5500,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"gentleman for a positive answer, he said, ""My business is in haste,"
5501,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"signior Baptista, I cannot come every day to woo. You knew my father."
5502,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"He is dead, and has left me heir to all his lands and goods. Then tell"
5503,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"me, if I get your daughter's love, what dowry you will give with her."""
5504,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,Baptista thought his manner was somewhat blunt for a lover; but being
5505,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"glad to get Katherine married, he answered that he would give her"
5506,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"twenty thousand crowns for her dowry, and half his estate at his"
5507,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"death: so this odd match was quickly agreed on, and Baptista went to"
5508,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"apprise his shrewish daughter of her lover's addresses, and sent her"
5509,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,in to Petruchio to listen to his suit.
5510,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5511,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,In the mean time Petruchio was settling with himself the mode of
5512,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"courtship he should pursue: and he said, ""I will woo her with some"
5513,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"spirit when she comes. If she rails at me, why then I will tell her"
5514,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"she sings as sweetly as a nightingale; and if she frowns, I will say"
5515,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,she looks as clear as roses newly washed with dew. If she will not
5516,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"speak a word, I will praise the eloquence of her language; and if she"
5517,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"bids me leave her, I will give her thanks as if she bid me stay with"
5518,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"her a week."" Now the stately Katherine entered, and Petruchio first"
5519,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"addressed her with ""Good morrow, Kate, for that is your name, I hear."""
5520,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Katherine, not liking this plain salutation, said disdainfully, ""They"
5521,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"call me Katherine who do speak to me."" ""You lie,"" replied the lover;"
5522,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"""for you are called plain Kate, and bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate"
5523,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"the Shrew; but, Kate, you are the prettiest Kate in Christendom, and"
5524,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"therefore, Kate, hearing your mildness praised in every town, I am"
5525,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"come to woo you for my wife."""
5526,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5527,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,A strange courtship they made of it. She in loud and angry terms
5528,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"shewing him how justly she had gained the name of Shrew, while he"
5529,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"still praised her sweet and courteous words, till at length, hearing"
5530,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"her father coming, he said, (intending to make as quick a wooing as"
5531,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"possible) ""Sweet Katherine, let us set this idle chat aside, for your"
5532,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"father has consented that you shall be my wife, your dowry is agreed"
5533,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"on, and whether you will or no, I will marry you."""
5534,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5535,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"And now Baptista entering, Petruchio told him his daughter had"
5536,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"received him kindly, and that she had promised to be married the next"
5537,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Sunday. This Katherine denied, saying she would rather see him hanged"
5538,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"on Sunday, and reproached her father for wishing to wed her to such"
5539,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,a mad-cap ruffian as Petruchio. Petruchio desired her father not to
5540,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"regard her angry words, for they had agreed she should seem reluctant"
5541,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"before him, but that when they were alone he had found her very fond"
5542,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"and loving; and he said, ""Give me your hand, Kate; I will go to Venice"
5543,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"to buy you fine apparel against our wedding-day. Provide the feast,"
5544,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"father, and bid the wedding guests. I will be sure to bring rings,"
5545,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"fine array, and rich clothes, that my Katherine may be fine; and kiss"
5546,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"me, Kate, for we will be married on Sunday."""
5547,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5548,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"On the Sunday all the wedding guests were assembled, but they waited"
5549,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"long before Petruchio came, and Katherine wept for vexation to think"
5550,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,that Petruchio had only been making a jest of her. At last however he
5551,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"appeared, but he brought none of the bridal finery he had promised"
5552,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Katherine, nor was he dressed himself like a bridegroom, but in"
5553,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"strange disordered attire, as if he meant to make a sport of the"
5554,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,serious business he came about; and his servant and the very horses
5555,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,on which they rode were in like manner in mean and fantastic fashion
5556,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,habited.
5557,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5558,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,Petruchio could not be persuaded to change his dress; he said
5559,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Katherine was to be married to him, and not to his clothes; and"
5560,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"finding it was in vain to argue with him, to the church they went,"
5561,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"he still behaving in the same mad way, for when the priest asked"
5562,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Petruchio if Katherine should be his wife, he swore so loud that"
5563,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"she should, that all amazed the priest let fall his book, and as he"
5564,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"stooped to take it up, this mad-brained bridegroom gave him such a"
5565,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"cuff, that down fell the priest and his book again. And all the while"
5566,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"they were being married he stampt and swore so, that the high-spirited"
5567,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Katherine trembled and shook with fear. After the ceremony was over,"
5568,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"while they were yet in the church he called for wine, and drank a loud"
5569,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"health to the company, and threw a sop which was at the bottom of"
5570,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"the glass full in the sexton's face, giving no other reason for this"
5571,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"strange act, than that the sexton's beard grew thin and hungerly, and"
5572,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,seemed to ask the sop as he was drinking. Never sure was there such a
5573,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"mad marriage; but Petruchio did but put this wildness on, the better"
5574,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,to succeed in the plot he had formed to tame his shrewish wife.
5575,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5576,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Baptista had provided a sumptuous marriage-feast, but when they"
5577,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"returned from church, Petruchio, taking hold of Katherine, declared"
5578,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,his intention of carrying his wife home instantly; and no remonstrance
5579,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"of his father-in-law, or angry words of the enraged Katherine, could"
5580,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,make him change his purpose; he claimed a husband's right to dispose
5581,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"of his wife as he pleased, and away he hurried Katherine off: he"
5582,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,seeming so daring and resolute that no one dared attempt to stop him.
5583,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5584,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Petruchio mounted his wife upon a miserable horse, lean and lank,"
5585,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"which he had picked out for the purpose, and himself and his servant"
5586,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"no better mounted, they journeyed on through rough and miry ways, and"
5587,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"ever when this horse of Katherine's stumbled, he would storm and swear"
5588,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"at the poor jaded beast, who could scarce crawl under his burthen, as"
5589,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,if he had been the most passionate man alive.
5590,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5591,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"At length, after a weary journey, during which Katherine had heard"
5592,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,nothing but the wild ravings of Petruchio at the servant and the
5593,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"horses, they arrived at his house. Petruchio welcomed her kindly to"
5594,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"her home, but he resolved she should have neither rest nor food that"
5595,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"night. The tables were spread, and supper soon served; but Petruchio,"
5596,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"pretending to find fault with every dish, threw the meat about the"
5597,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"floor, and ordered the servants to remove it away, and all this"
5598,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"he did, as he said, in love for his Katherine, that she might not"
5599,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,eat meat that was not well dressed. And when Katherine weary and
5600,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"supperless retired to rest, he found the same fault with the bed,"
5601,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"throwing the pillows and bed-clothes about the room, so that she was"
5602,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"forced to sit down in a chair, where if she chanced to drop asleep,"
5603,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"she was presently awakened by the loud voice of her husband, storming"
5604,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,at the servants for the ill-making of his wife's bridal-bed.
5605,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5606,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"The next day Petruchio pursued the same course, still speaking kind"
5607,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"words to Katherine, but when she attempted to eat, finding fault with"
5608,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"every thing that was set before her, throwing the breakfast on the"
5609,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"floor as he had done the supper; and Katherine, the haughty Katherine,"
5610,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,was fain to beg the servants would bring her secretly a morsel of
5611,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"food, but they being instructed by Petruchio replied, they dared not"
5612,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"give her any thing unknown to their master. ""Ah,"" said she, ""did he"
5613,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,marry me to famish me? Beggars that come to my father's door have
5614,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"food given them. But I, who never knew what it was to intreat for any"
5615,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"thing, am starved for want of food, giddy for want of sleep, with"
5616,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed, and that which vexes me more"
5617,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"than all, he does it under the name of perfect love, pretending that"
5618,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"if I sleep or eat it were present death to me."" Here her soliloquy was"
5619,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"interrupted by the entrance of Petruchio: he, not meaning she should"
5620,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"be quite starved, had brought her a small portion of meat, and he said"
5621,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"to her, ""How fares my sweet Kate? Here, love, you see how diligent I"
5622,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"am, I have dressed your meat myself. I am sure this kindness merits"
5623,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"thanks. What not a word? Nay then you love not the meat, and all the"
5624,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"pains I have taken is to no purpose."" He then ordered the servant to"
5625,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"take the dish away. Extreme hunger, which had abated the pride of"
5626,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Katherine, made her say, though angered to the heart, ""I pray you, let"
5627,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"it stand."" But this was not all Petruchio intended to bring her to,"
5628,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"and he replied, ""The poorest service is repaid with thanks, and so"
5629,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"shall mine before you touch the meat."" On this Katherine brought out"
5630,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"a reluctant ""I thank you, sir."" And now he suffered her to make a"
5631,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"slender meal, saying, ""Much good may it do your gentle heart, Kate;"
5632,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"eat apace! And now, my honey love, we will return to your father's"
5633,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"house, and revel it as bravely as the best, with silken coats and caps"
5634,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"and golden rings, with ruffs and scarfs and fans and double change of"
5635,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"finery;"" and to make her believe he really intended to give her these"
5636,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"gay things, he called in a taylor and a haberdasher, who brought some"
5637,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"new clothes he had ordered for her, and then giving her plate to the"
5638,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"servant to take away, before she had half satisfied her hunger, he"
5639,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"said, ""What? have you dined?"" The haberdasher presented a cap, saying,"
5640,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"""Here is the cap your worship bespoke;"" on which Petruchio began to"
5641,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"storm afresh, saying, the cap was moulded in a porringer, and that"
5642,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"it was no bigger than a cockle or a walnut shell, desiring the"
5643,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"haberdasher to take it away and make a bigger. Katherine said, ""I will"
5644,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"have this; all gentlewomen wear such caps as these."" ""When you are"
5645,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"gentle,"" replied Petruchio, ""you shall have one too, and not till"
5646,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"then."" The meat Katherine had eaten had a little revived her fallen"
5647,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"spirits, and she said, ""Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak,"
5648,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"and speak I will. I am no child, no babe; your betters have endured"
5649,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"to hear me say my mind; and if you cannot, you had better stop you"
5650,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"ears."" Petruchio would not hear these angry words, for he had happily"
5651,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,discovered a better way of managing his wife than keeping up a
5652,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"jangling argument with her; therefore his answer was, ""Why, you say"
5653,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"true, it is a paltry cap, and I love you for not liking it."" ""Love me,"
5654,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"or love me not,"" said Katherine, ""I like the cap, and I will have this"
5655,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"cap or none."" ""You say you wish to see the gown,"" said Petruchio,"
5656,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"still affecting to misunderstand her. The taylor then came forward,"
5657,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"and shewed her a fine gown he had made for her. Petruchio, whose"
5658,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"intent was that she should have neither cap nor gown, found as much"
5659,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"fault with that. ""O mercy, Heaven!"" said he, ""what stuff is here!"
5660,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"What, do you call this a sleeve? it is like a demy-cannon, carved up"
5661,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"and down like an apple-tart."" The taylor said, ""You bid me make it"
5662,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"according to the fashion of the times;"" and Katherine said she never"
5663,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"saw a better fashioned gown. This was enough for Petruchio, and"
5664,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"privately desiring these people might be paid for their goods, and"
5665,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,excuses made to them for the seemingly strange treatment he bestowed
5666,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"upon them, he with fierce words and furious gestures drove the taylor"
5667,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"and the haberdasher out of the room: and then, turning to Katherine,"
5668,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"he said, ""Well, come, my Kate, we will go to your father's even in"
5669,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"these mean garments we now wear."" And then he ordered his horses,"
5670,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"affirming they should reach Baptista's house by dinner-time, for that"
5671,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"it was but seven o'clock. Now it was not early morning, but the very"
5672,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"middle of the day, when he spoke this; therefore Katherine ventured"
5673,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"to say, though modestly, being almost overcome by the vehemence of"
5674,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"his manner, ""I dare assure you, sir, it is two o'clock, and will be"
5675,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"supper-time before we get there."" But Petruchio meant that she should"
5676,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"be so completely subdued, that she should assent to every thing he"
5677,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"said, before he carried her to her father; and therefore, as if he"
5678,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"were lord even of the sun, and could command the hours, he said it"
5679,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"should be what time he pleased to have it, before he set forward;"
5680,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"""For,"" said he, ""whatever I say or do, you still are crossing it. I"
5681,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"will not go to-day, and when I go, it shall be what o'clock I say it"
5682,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"is."" Another day Katherine was forced to practise her newly-found"
5683,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"obedience, and not till he had brought her proud spirit to such a"
5684,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"perfect subjection, that she dared not remember there was such a word"
5685,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"as contradiction, would Petruchio allow her to go to her father's"
5686,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"house; and even while they were upon their journey thither, she was in"
5687,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"danger of being turned back again, only because she happened to hint"
5688,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"it was the sun, when he affirmed the moon shone brightly at noonday."
5689,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"""Now, by my mother's son,"" said he, ""and that is myself, it shall be"
5690,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"the moon, or stars, or what I list, before I journey to your father's"
5691,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"house."" He then made as if he were going back again; but Katherine, no"
5692,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"longer Katherine the Shrew, but the obedient wife, said, ""Let us go"
5693,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"forward, I pray, now we have come so far, and it shall be the sun, or"
5694,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"moon, or what you please, and if you please to call it a rush candle"
5695,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"henceforth, I vow it shall be so for me."" This he was resolved to"
5696,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"prove, therefore he said again, ""I say, it is the moon."" ""I know it is"
5697,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"the moon,"" replied Katherine. ""You lie, it is the blessed sun,"" said"
5698,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Petruchio. ""Then it is the blessed sun,"" replied Katherine; ""but sun"
5699,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"it is not, when you say it is not. What you will have it named even so"
5700,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"it is, and so it ever shall be for Katherine."" Now then he suffered"
5701,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,her to proceed on her journey; but further to try if this yielding
5702,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"humour would last, he addressed an old gentleman they met on the road"
5703,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"as if he had been a young woman, saying to him, ""Good morrow, gentle"
5704,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"mistress;"" and asked Katherine if she had ever beheld a fairer"
5705,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"gentlewoman, praising the red and white of the old man's cheeks, and"
5706,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"comparing his eyes to two bright stars; and again he addressed him,"
5707,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"saying, ""Fair lovely maid, once more good day to you!"" and said to"
5708,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"his wife, ""Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake."" The now"
5709,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"completely vanquished Katherine quickly adopted her husband's opinion,"
5710,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"and made her speech in like sort to the old gentleman, saying to him,"
5711,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"""Young budding virgin, you are fair, and fresh, and sweet: whither are"
5712,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"you going, and where is your dwelling? Happy are the parents of so"
5713,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"fair a child."" ""Why, how now, Kate,"" said Petruchio; ""I hope you are"
5714,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"not mad. This is a man, old and wrinkled, faded and withered, and not"
5715,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"a maiden, as you say he is."" On this Katherine said, ""Pardon me, old"
5716,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"gentleman; the sun has so dazzled my eyes, that every thing I look on"
5717,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,seemeth green. Now I perceive you are a reverend father: I hope you
5718,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"will pardon me for my sad mistake.""--""Do, good old grandsire,"" said"
5719,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Petruchio, ""and tell us which way you are travelling. We shall be glad"
5720,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"of your good company, if you are going our way."" The old gentleman"
5721,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"replied, ""Fair sir, and you my merry mistress, your strange encounter"
5722,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"has much amazed me. My name is Vincentio, and I am going to visit a"
5723,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"son of mine who lives at Padua."" Then Petruchio knew the old gentleman"
5724,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"to be the father of Lucentio, a young gentleman who was to be married"
5725,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"to Baptista's younger daughter, Bianca, and he made Vincentio very"
5726,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,happy by telling him the rich marriage his son was about to make; and
5727,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,they all journeyed on pleasantly together till they came to Baptista's
5728,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"house, where there was a large company assembled to celebrate the"
5729,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"wedding of Bianca and Lucentio, Baptista having willingly consented to"
5730,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,the marriage of Bianca when he had got Katherine off his hands.
5731,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5732,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"When they entered, Baptista welcomed them to the wedding feast, and"
5733,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,there was present also another newly-married pair.
5734,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,
5735,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Lucentio, Bianca's husband, and Hortensio, the other new-married man,"
5736,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"could not forbear sly jests, which seemed to hint at the shrewish"
5737,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"disposition of Petruchio's wife, and these fond bridegrooms seemed"
5738,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"highly pleased with the mild tempers of the ladies they had chosen,"
5739,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,laughing at Petruchio for his less fortunate choice. Petruchio took
5740,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,little notice of their jokes till the ladies were retired after
5741,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"dinner, and then he perceived Baptista himself joined in the laugh"
5742,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,against him; for when Petruchio affirmed that his wife would prove
5743,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"more obedient than theirs, the father of Katherine said, ""Now, in good"
5744,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"sadness, son Petruchio, I fear you have got the veriest shrew of all."""
5745,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"""Well,"" said Petruchio, ""I say no, and therefore for assurance that I"
5746,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"speak the truth, let us each one send for his wife, and he whose wife"
5747,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"is most obedient to come at first when she is sent for, shall win a"
5748,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"wager which we will propose."" To this the other two husbands willingly"
5749,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"consented, for they were quite confident that their gentle wives would"
5750,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,prove more obedient than the headstrong Katherine; and they proposed
5751,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"a wager of twenty crowns, but Petruchio merrily said he would lay as"
5752,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"much as that upon his hawk or hound, but twenty times as much upon his"
5753,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"wife. Lucentio and Hortensio raised the wager to an hundred crowns,"
5754,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,and Lucentio first sent his servant to desire Bianca would come to
5755,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"him. But the servant returned, and said, ""Sir, my mistress sends you"
5756,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"word she is busy and cannot come."" ""How,"" said Petruchio, ""does she"
5757,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"say she is busy and cannot come? Is that an answer for a wife?"" Then"
5758,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"they laughed at him, and said, it would be well if Katherine did not"
5759,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,send him a worse answer. And now it was Hortensio's turn to send for
5760,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"his wife; and he said to his servant, ""Go, and intreat my wife to come"
5761,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"to me."" ""Oh ho! intreat her!"" said Petruchio. ""Nay, then, she needs"
5762,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"must come."" ""I am afraid, sir,"" said Hortensio, ""your wife will not be"
5763,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"intreated."" But presently this civil husband looked a little blank,"
5764,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"when the servant returned without his mistress; and he said to him,"
5765,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"""How now! Where is my wife?"" ""Sir,"" said the servant, ""my mistress"
5766,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"says you have some goodly jest in hand, and therefore she will not"
5767,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"come. She bids you come to her."" ""Worse and worse!"" said Petruchio;"
5768,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"and then he sent his servant, saying, ""Sirrah, go to your mistress,"
5769,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"and tell her I command her to come to me."" The company had scarcely"
5770,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"time to think she would not obey this summons, when Baptista, all in"
5771,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"amaze, exclaimed, ""Now, by my hollidam, here comes Katherine!"" and she"
5772,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"entered, saying meekly to Petruchio, ""What is your will, sir, that you"
5773,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"send for me?""--""Where is your sister and Hortensio's wife?"" said he."
5774,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Katherine replied, ""They sit conferring by the parlour-fire."" ""Go,"
5775,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"fetch them hither!"" said Petruchio. Away went Katherine without reply"
5776,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"to perform her husband's command. ""Here is a wonder,"" said Lucentio,"
5777,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"""if you talk of a wonder."" ""And so it is,"" said Hortensio; ""I marvel"
5778,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"what it bodes."" ""Marry, peace it bodes,"" said Petruchio, ""and love,"
5779,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"and quiet life, and right supremacy; and to be short, every thing"
5780,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"that is sweet and happy."" Katherine's father, overjoyed to see this"
5781,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"reformation in his daughter, said, ""Now, fair befall thee, son"
5782,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Petruchio! you have won the wager, and I will add another twenty"
5783,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"thousand crowns to her dowry, as if she were another daughter, for"
5784,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"she is changed as if she had never been."" ""Nay,"" said Petruchio, ""I"
5785,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"will win the wager better yet, and shew more signs of her new-built"
5786,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"virtue and obedience."" Katherine now entering with the two ladies,"
5787,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"he continued, ""See where she comes, and brings your froward wives as"
5788,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"prisoners to her womanly persuasion. Katherine, that cap of yours"
5789,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"does not become you; off with that bauble, and throw it under foot."""
5790,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Katherine instantly took off her cap, and threw it down. ""Lord!"" said"
5791,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"Hortensio's wife, ""may I never have a cause to sigh till I am brought"
5792,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"to such a silly pass!"" And Bianca, she too said, ""Fie, what foolish"
5793,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"duty call you this!"" On this Bianca's husband said to her, ""I wish"
5794,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"your duty were as foolish too! The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,"
5795,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"has cost me an hundred crowns since dinner-time."" ""The more fool you,"""
5796,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"said Bianca, ""for laying on my duty."" ""Katherine,"" said Petruchio,"
5797,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"""I charge you tell these headstrong women what duty they owe their"
5798,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"lords and husbands."" And to the wonder of all present, the reformed"
5799,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,shrewish lady spoke as eloquently in praise of the wife-like duty of
5800,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"obedience, as she had practised it implicitly in a ready submission"
5801,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"to Petruchio's will. And Katherine once more became famous in Padua,"
5802,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,"not as heretofore, as Katherine the Shrew, but as Katherine the most"
5803,THE TAMING OF THE SHREW,obedient and duteous wife in Padua.

5810,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,(_By Mary Lamb_)
5811,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5812,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5813,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"The states of Syracuse and Ephesus being at variance, there was a"
5814,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"cruel law made at Ephesus, ordaining that if any merchant of Syracuse"
5815,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"was seen in the city of Ephesus, he was to be put to death, unless he"
5816,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,could pay a thousand marks for the ransom of his life.
5817,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5818,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Ægeon, an old merchant of Syracuse, was discovered in the streets of"
5819,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Ephesus, and brought before the duke, either to pay this heavy fine,"
5820,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,or to receive sentence of death.
5821,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5822,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Ægeon had no money to pay the fine, and the duke, before he pronounced"
5823,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"the sentence of death upon him, desired him to relate the history of"
5824,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"his life, and to tell for what cause he had ventured to come to the"
5825,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"city of Ephesus, which it was death for any Syracusan merchant to"
5826,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,enter.
5827,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5828,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Ægeon said, that he did not fear to die, for sorrow had made him weary"
5829,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"of his life, but that a heavier task could not have been imposed upon"
5830,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,him than to relate the events of his unfortunate life. He then began
5831,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"his own history, in the following words:--"
5832,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5833,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"""I was born at Syracuse, and brought up to the profession of a"
5834,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"merchant. I married a lady with whom I lived very happily, but being"
5835,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"obliged to go to Epidamnium, I was detained there by my business"
5836,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"six months, and then, finding I should be obliged to stay some time"
5837,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"longer, I sent for my wife, who, as soon as she arrived, was brought"
5838,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"to bed of two sons, and what was very strange, they were both so"
5839,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"exactly alike, that it was impossible to distinguish the one from"
5840,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,the other. At the same time that my wife was brought to bed of these
5841,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"twin-boys, a poor woman in the inn where my wife lodged was brought to"
5842,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"bed of two sons, and these twins were as much like each other as my"
5843,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"two sons were. The parents of these children being exceedingly poor, I"
5844,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"bought the two boys, and brought them up to attend upon my sons."
5845,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5846,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"""My sons were very fine children, and my wife was not a little proud"
5847,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"of two such boys: and she daily wishing to return home, I unwillingly"
5848,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"agreed, and in an evil hour we got on shipboard; for we had not sailed"
5849,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"above a league from Epidamnium before a dreadful storm arose, which"
5850,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"continued with such violence, that the sailors, seeing no chance"
5851,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"of saving the ship, crowded into the boat to save their own lives,"
5852,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"leaving us alone in the ship, which we every moment expected would be"
5853,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,destroyed by the fury of the storm.
5854,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5855,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"""The incessant weeping of my wife, and the piteous complaints of the"
5856,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"pretty babes, who not knowing what to fear, wept for fashion, because"
5857,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"they saw their mother weep, filled me with terror for them, though"
5858,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,I did not for myself fear death; and all my thoughts were bent to
5859,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,contrive means for their safety. I tied my youngest son to the end
5860,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"of a small spare mast, such as seafaring men provide against storms;"
5861,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"at the other end I bound the youngest of the twin-slaves, and at the"
5862,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,same time I directed my wife how to fasten the other children in like
5863,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,manner to another mast. She thus having the care of the two eldest
5864,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"children, and I of the two younger, we bound ourselves separately to"
5865,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,these masts with the children; and but for this contrivance we had
5866,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"all been lost, for the ship split on a mighty rock and was dashed in"
5867,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"pieces, and we clinging to these slender masts were supported above"
5868,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"the water, where I, having the care of two children, was unable to"
5869,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"assist my wife, who with the other children were soon separated from"
5870,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"me; but while they were yet in my sight, they were taken up by a boat"
5871,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"of fishermen, from Corinth (as I supposed), and seeing them in safety,"
5872,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"I had no care but to struggle with the wild sea waves, to preserve my"
5873,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,dear son and the youngest slave. At length we in our turn were taken
5874,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"up by a ship, and the sailors, knowing me, gave us kind welcome and"
5875,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"assistance, and landed us in safety at Syracuse; but from that sad"
5876,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,hour I have never known what became of my wife and eldest child.
5877,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5878,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"""My youngest son, and now my only care, when he was eighteen years of"
5879,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"age, began to be inquisitive after his mother and his brother, and"
5880,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"often importuned me that he might take his attendant, the young slave,"
5881,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"who had also lost his brother, and go in search of them: at length"
5882,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"I unwillingly gave consent, for though I anxiously desired to hear"
5883,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"tidings of my wife and eldest son, yet in sending my younger one to"
5884,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,find them I hazarded the loss of him also. It is now seven years since
5885,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,my son left me; five years have I past in travelling through the world
5886,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"in search of him: I have been in farthest Greece, and through the"
5887,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"bounds of Asia, and coasting homewards I landed here in Ephesus, being"
5888,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,unwilling to leave any place unsought that harbours men; but this day
5889,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"must end the story of my life, and happy should I think myself in my"
5890,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"death, if I were assured my wife and sons were living."""
5891,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5892,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,Here the hapless Ægeon ended the account of his misfortunes; and the
5893,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"duke, pitying this unfortunate father, who had brought upon himself"
5894,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"this great peril by his love for his lost son, said, if it were not"
5895,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"against the laws, which his oath and dignity did not permit him to"
5896,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"alter, he would freely pardon him; yet, instead of dooming him to"
5897,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"instant death, as the strict letter of the law required, he would give"
5898,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"him that day, to try if he could beg or borrow the money to pay the"
5899,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,fine.
5900,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5901,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"This day of grace did seem no great favour to Ægeon, for not knowing"
5902,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"any man in Ephesus, there seemed to him but little chance that any"
5903,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,stranger would lend or give him a thousand marks to pay the fine; and
5904,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"helpless and hopeless of any relief, he retired from the presence of"
5905,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,the duke in the custody of a jailor.
5906,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5907,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,Ægeon supposed he knew no person in Ephesus; but at the very time he
5908,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,was in danger of losing his life through the careful search he was
5909,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"making after his youngest son, that son and his eldest son also were"
5910,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,both in the city of Ephesus.
5911,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5912,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Ægeon's sons, besides being exactly alike in face and person, were"
5913,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"both named alike, being both called Antipholis, and the two twin"
5914,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"slaves were also both named Dromio. Ægeon's youngest son, Antipholis"
5915,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"of Syracuse, he whom the old man had come to Ephesus to seek, happened"
5916,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,to arrive at Ephesus with his slave Dromio that very same day that
5917,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Ægeon did; and he being also a merchant of Syracuse, he would have"
5918,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"been in the same danger that his father was, but by good fortune"
5919,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,he met a friend who told him the peril an old merchant of Syracuse
5920,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"was in, and advised him to pass for a merchant of Epidamnium; this"
5921,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Antipholis agreed to do, and he was sorry to hear one of his own"
5922,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"countrymen was in this danger, but he little thought this old merchant"
5923,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,was his own father.
5924,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5925,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"The eldest son of Ægeon (who must be called Antipholis of Ephesus, to"
5926,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,distinguish him from his brother Antipholis of Syracuse) had lived at
5927,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Ephesus twenty years, and, being a rich man, was well able to have"
5928,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,paid the money for the ransom of his father's life; but Antipholis
5929,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"knew nothing of his father, being so young when he was taken out of"
5930,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"the sea with his mother by the fishermen, that he only remembered he"
5931,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"had been so preserved, but he had no recollection of either his father"
5932,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,or his mother; the fishermen who took up this Antipholis and his
5933,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,mother and the young slave Dromio having carried the two children away
5934,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"from her (to the great grief of that unhappy lady), intending to sell"
5935,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,them.
5936,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5937,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Antipholis and Dromio were sold by them to duke Menaphon, a famous"
5938,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"warrior, who was uncle to the duke of Ephesus, and he carried the boys"
5939,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"to Ephesus, when he went to visit the duke his nephew."
5940,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5941,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"The duke of Ephesus taking a liking to young Antipholis, when he grew"
5942,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"up, made him an officer in his army, in which he distinguished himself"
5943,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"by his great bravery in the wars, where he saved the life of his"
5944,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"patron the duke, who rewarded his merit by marrying him to Adriana, a"
5945,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,rich lady of Ephesus; with whom he was living (his slave Dromio still
5946,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,attending him) at the time his father came there.
5947,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5948,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Antipholis of Syracuse, when he parted with his friend, who advised"
5949,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"him to say he came from Epidamnium, gave his slave Dromio some money"
5950,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"to carry to the inn where he intended to dine, and in the mean time he"
5951,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"said he would walk about and view the city, and observe the manners of"
5952,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,the people.
5953,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5954,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Dromio was a pleasant fellow, and when Antipholis was dull and"
5955,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"melancholy, he used to divert himself with the odd humours and merry"
5956,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"jests of his slave, so that the freedoms of speech he allowed in"
5957,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,Dromio were greater than is usual between masters and their servants.
5958,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5959,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"When Antipholis of Syracuse had sent Dromio away, he stood a while"
5960,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,thinking over his solitary wanderings in search of his mother and his
5961,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"brother, of whom in no place where he landed could he hear the least"
5962,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"tidings; and he said sorrowfully to himself, ""I am like a drop of"
5963,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"water in the ocean, which seeking to find its fellow-drop, loses"
5964,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"itself in the wide sea. So I unhappily, to find a mother and a"
5965,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"brother, do lose myself."""
5966,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5967,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"While he was thus meditating on his weary travels, which had hitherto"
5968,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"been so useless, Dromio (as he thought) returned. Antipholis,"
5969,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"wondering that he came back so soon, asked him where he had left the"
5970,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"money. Now it was not his own Dromio, but the twin-brother that lived"
5971,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"with Antipholis of Ephesus, that he spoke to. The two Dromios and the"
5972,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,two Antipholises were still as much alike as Ægeon had said they were
5973,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,in their infancy; therefore no wonder Antipholis thought it was his
5974,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"own slave returned, and asked him why he came back so soon. Dromio"
5975,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"replied, ""My mistress sent me to bid you come to dinner. The capon"
5976,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"burns, and the pig falls from the spit, and the meat will be all"
5977,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"cold if you do not come home."" ""These jests are out of season,"" said"
5978,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Antipholis: ""where did you leave the money?"" Dromio still answering,"
5979,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"that his mistress had sent him to fetch Antipholis to dinner: ""What"
5980,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"mistress?"" said Antipholis. ""Why, your worship's wife, sir,"" replied"
5981,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Dromio. Antipholis having no wife, he was very angry with Dromio, and"
5982,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"said, ""Because I familiarly sometimes chat with you, you presume to"
5983,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,jest with me in this free manner. I am not in a sportive humour now:
5984,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"where is the money? we being strangers here, how dare you trust so"
5985,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"great a charge from your own custody?"" Dromio hearing his master, as"
5986,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"he thought him, talk of their being strangers, supposing Antipholis"
5987,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"was jesting, replied merrily, ""I pray you, sir, jest as you sit"
5988,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"at dinner: I had no charge but to fetch you home, to dine with my"
5989,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"mistress and her sister."" Now Antipholis lost all patience, and beat"
5990,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Dromio, who ran home, and told his mistress that his master had"
5991,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"refused to come to dinner, and said that he had no wife."
5992,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
5993,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Adriana, the wife of Antipholis of Ephesus, was very angry, when she"
5994,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,heard that her husband said he had no wife; for she was of a jealous
5995,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"temper, and she said her husband meant that he loved another lady"
5996,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"better than herself; and she began to fret, and say unkind words of"
5997,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"jealousy and reproach of her husband; and her sister Luciana, who"
5998,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"lived with her, tried in vain to persuade her out of her groundless"
5999,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,suspicions.
6000,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6001,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Antipholis of Syracuse went to the inn, and found Dromio with the"
6002,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"money in safety there, and seeing his own Dromio, he was going again"
6003,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"to chide him for his free jests, when Adriana came up to him, and not"
6004,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"doubting but it was her husband she saw, she began to reproach him for"
6005,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"looking strange upon her (as well he might, never having seen this"
6006,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,angry lady before); and then she told him how well he loved her before
6007,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"they were married, and that now he loved some other lady instead"
6008,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"of her. ""How comes it now, my husband,"" said she, ""O how comes it"
6009,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"that I have lost your love?"" ""Plead you to me, fair dame?"" said the"
6010,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,astonished Antipholis. It was in vain he told her he was not her
6011,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"husband, and that he had been in Ephesus but two hours; she insisted"
6012,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"on his going home with her, and Antipholis at last, being unable to"
6013,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"get away, went with her to his brother's house, and dined with Adriana"
6014,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"and her sister, the one calling him husband and the other brother, he,"
6015,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"all amazed, thinking he must have been married to her in his sleep, or"
6016,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"that he was sleeping now. And Dromio, who followed them, was no less"
6017,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"surprised, for the cook-maid, who was his brother's wife, also claimed"
6018,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,him for her husband.
6019,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6020,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"While Antipholis of Syracuse was dining with his brother's wife, his"
6021,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"brother, the real husband, returned home to dinner with his slave"
6022,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Dromio; but the servants would not open the door, because their"
6023,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,mistress had ordered them not to admit any company; and when they
6024,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"repeatedly knocked, and said they were Antipholis and Dromio, the"
6025,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"maids laughed at them, and said that Antipholis was at dinner with"
6026,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"their mistress, and Dromio was in the kitchen; and though they almost"
6027,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"knocked the door down, they could not gain admittance, and at last"
6028,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Antipholis went away very angry, and strangely surprised at hearing a"
6029,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,gentleman was dining with his wife.
6030,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6031,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"When Antipholis of Syracuse had finished his dinner, he was so"
6032,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"perplexed at the lady's still persisting in calling him husband, and"
6033,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"at hearing that Dromio had also been claimed by the cook-maid, that"
6034,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"he left the house, as soon as he could find any pretence to get away;"
6035,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"for though he was very much pleased with Luciana, the sister, yet the"
6036,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"jealous-tempered Adriana he disliked very much, nor was Dromio at all"
6037,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,better satisfied with his fair wife in the kitchen; therefore both
6038,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,master and man were glad to get away from their new wives as fast as
6039,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,they could.
6040,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6041,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"The moment Antipholis of Syracuse had left the house, he was met by"
6042,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"a goldsmith, who mistaking him, as Adriana had done, for Antipholis"
6043,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"of Ephesus, gave him a gold chain, calling him by his name; and when"
6044,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Antipholis would have refused the chain, saying it did not belong to"
6045,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"him, the goldsmith replied he made it by his own orders; and went"
6046,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"away, leaving the chain in the hands of Antipholis, who ordered his"
6047,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"man Dromio to get his things on board a ship, not choosing to stay in"
6048,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"a place any longer, where he met with such strange adventures that he"
6049,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,surely thought himself bewitched.
6050,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6051,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"The goldsmith who had given the chain to the wrong Antipholis, was"
6052,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"arrested immediately after for a sum of money he owed; and Antipholis,"
6053,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"the married brother, to whom the goldsmith thought he had given the"
6054,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"chain, happened to come to the place where the officer was arresting"
6055,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"the goldsmith, who, when he saw Antipholis, asked him to pay for"
6056,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"the gold chain he had just delivered to him, the price amounting to"
6057,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,nearly the same sum as that for which he had been arrested. Antipholis
6058,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"denying the having received the chain, and the goldsmith persisting"
6059,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"to declare that he had but a few minutes before given it to him, they"
6060,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"disputed this matter a long time, both thinking they were right, for"
6061,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Antipholis knew the goldsmith never gave him the chain, and, so like"
6062,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"were the two brothers, the goldsmith was as certain he had delivered"
6063,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"the chain into his hands, till at last the officer took the goldsmith"
6064,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"away to prison for the debt he owed, and at the same time the"
6065,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,goldsmith made the officer arrest Antipholis for the price of the
6066,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"chain; so that at the conclusion of their dispute, Antipholis and the"
6067,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,merchant were both taken away to prison together.
6068,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6069,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"As Antipholis was going to prison, he met Dromio of Syracuse, his"
6070,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"brother's slave, and mistaking him for his own, he ordered him to go"
6071,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"to Adriana his wife, and tell her to send the money for which he was"
6072,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,arrested. Dromio wondering that his master should send him back to the
6073,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"strange house where he dined, and from which he had just before been"
6074,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"in such haste to depart, did not dare to reply, though he came to tell"
6075,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,his master the ship was ready to sail; for he saw Antipholis was in
6076,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"no humour to be jested with. Therefore he went away, grumbling within"
6077,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"himself that he must return to Adriana's house, ""Where,"" said he,"
6078,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"""Dowsabel claims me for a husband: but I must go, for servants must"
6079,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"obey their masters' commands."""
6080,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6081,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Adriana gave him the money, and as Dromio was returning, he met"
6082,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Antipholis of Syracuse, who was still in amaze at the surprising"
6083,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"adventures he met with; for his brother being well known in Ephesus,"
6084,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,there was hardly a man he met in the streets but saluted him as an
6085,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,old acquaintance: some offered him money which they said was owing to
6086,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"him, some invited him to come and see them, and some gave him thanks"
6087,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"for kindnesses they said he had done them, all mistaking him for his"
6088,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"brother. A taylor shewed him some silks he had bought for him, and"
6089,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,insisted upon taking measure of him for some clothes.
6090,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6091,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,Antipholis began to think he was among a nation of sorcerers and
6092,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"witches, and Dromio did not at all relieve his master from his"
6093,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"bewildered thoughts, by asking him how he got free from the officer"
6094,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"who was carrying him to prison, and giving him the purse of gold which"
6095,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,Adriana had sent to pay the debt with. This talk of Dromio's of the
6096,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"arrest and of a prison, and of the money he had brought from Adriana,"
6097,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"perfectly confounded Antipholis, and he said, ""This fellow Dromio is"
6098,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"certainly distracted, and we wander here in illusions;"" and quite"
6099,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"terrified at his own confused thoughts, he cried out, ""Some blessed"
6100,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"power deliver us from this strange place!"""
6101,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6102,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"And now another stranger came up to him, and she was a lady, and she"
6103,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"too called him Antipholis, and told him he had dined with her that"
6104,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"day, and asked him for a gold chain which she said he had promised"
6105,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"to give her. Antipholis now lost all patience, and calling her a"
6106,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"sorceress, he denied that he had ever promised her a chain, or dined"
6107,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"with her, or had even seen her face before that moment. The lady"
6108,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"persisted in affirming he had dined with her, and had promised her"
6109,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"a chain, which Antipholis still denying, she farther said, that she"
6110,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"had given him a valuable ring, and if he would not give her the gold"
6111,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"chain, she insisted upon having her own ring again. On this Antipholis"
6112,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"became quite frantic, and again calling her sorceress and witch, and"
6113,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"denying all knowledge of her or her ring, ran away from her, leaving"
6114,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"her astonished at his words and his wild looks, for nothing to her"
6115,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"appeared more certain than that he had dined with her, and that she"
6116,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"had given him a ring, in consequence of his promising to make her"
6117,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,a present of a gold chain. But this lady had fallen into the same
6118,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"mistake the others had done, for she had taken him for his brother;"
6119,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,the married Antipholis had done all the things she taxed this
6120,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,Antipholis with.
6121,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6122,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,When the married Antipholis was denied entrance into his own house
6123,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"(those within supposing him to be already there), he had gone away"
6124,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"very angry, believing it to be one of his wife's jealous freaks, to"
6125,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"which she was very subject, and remembering that she had often falsely"
6126,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"accused him of visiting other ladies, he to be revenged on her for"
6127,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"shutting him out of his own house, determined to go and dine with this"
6128,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"lady, and she receiving him with great civility, and his wife having"
6129,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"so highly offended him, Antipholis promised to give her a gold chain,"
6130,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,which he had intended as a present for his wife; it was the same chain
6131,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,which the goldsmith by mistake had given to his brother. The lady
6132,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"liked so well the thoughts of having a fine gold chain, that she gave"
6133,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"the married Antipholis a ring; which when, as she supposed (taking his"
6134,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"brother for him), he denied, and said he did not know her, and left"
6135,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"her in such a wild passion, she began to think he was certainly out"
6136,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,of his senses; and presently she resolved to go and tell Adriana that
6137,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"her husband was mad. And while she was telling it to Adriana, he came,"
6138,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,attended by the jailor (who allowed him to come home to get the money
6139,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"to pay the debt), for the purse of money, which Adriana had sent by"
6140,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Dromio, and he had delivered to the other Antipholis."
6141,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6142,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,Adriana believed the story the lady told her of her husband's madness
6143,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"must be true, when he reproached her for shutting him out of his own"
6144,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,house; and remembering how he had protested all dinner-time that he
6145,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"was not her husband, and had never been in Ephesus till that day,"
6146,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,she had no doubt that he was mad; she therefore paid the jailor the
6147,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"money, and having discharged him, she ordered her servants to bind her"
6148,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"husband with ropes, and had him conveyed into a dark room, and sent"
6149,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,for a doctor to come and cure him of his madness: Antipholis all the
6150,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"while hotly exclaiming against this false accusation, which the exact"
6151,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,likeness he bore to his brother had brought upon him. But his rage
6152,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,only the more confirmed them in the belief that he was mad; and Dromio
6153,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"persisting in the same story, they bound him also, and took him away"
6154,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,along with his master.
6155,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6156,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Soon after Adriana had put her husband into confinement, a servant"
6157,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,came to tell her that Antipholis and Dromio must have broken loose
6158,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"from their keepers, for that they were both walking at liberty in"
6159,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"the next street. On hearing this, Adriana ran out to fetch him home,"
6160,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,taking some people with her to secure her husband again; and her
6161,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,sister went along with her. When they came to the gates of a convent
6162,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"in their neighbourhood, there they saw Antipholis and Dromio, as they"
6163,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"thought, being again deceived by the likeness of the twin-brothers."
6164,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6165,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,Antipholis of Syracuse was still beset with the perplexities this
6166,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,likeness had brought upon him. The chain which the goldsmith had given
6167,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"him was about his neck, and the goldsmith was reproaching him for"
6168,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"denying that he had it, and refusing to pay for it, and Antipholis"
6169,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,was protesting that the goldsmith freely gave him the chain in the
6170,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"morning, and that from that hour he had never seen the goldsmith"
6171,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,again.
6172,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6173,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"And now Adriana came up to him, and claimed him as her lunatic"
6174,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"husband, who had escaped from his keepers; and the men she brought"
6175,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,with her were going to lay violent hands on Antipholis and Dromio; but
6176,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"they ran into the convent, and Antipholis begged the abbess to give"
6177,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,him shelter in her house.
6178,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6179,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,And now came out the lady abbess herself to enquire into the cause
6180,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"of this disturbance. She was a grave and venerable lady, and wise to"
6181,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"judge of what she saw, and she would not too hastily give up the man"
6182,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,who had sought protection in her house; so she strictly questioned the
6183,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"wife about the story she told of her husband's madness, and she said,"
6184,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"""What is the cause of this sudden distemper of your husband's? Has he"
6185,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,lost his wealth at sea? Or is it the death of some dear friend that
6186,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"has disturbed his mind?"" Adriana replied, that no such things as these"
6187,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"had been the cause. ""Perhaps,"" said the abbess, ""he has fixed his"
6188,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,affections on some other lady than you his wife; and that has driven
6189,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"him to this state."" Adriana said she had long thought the love of some"
6190,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,other lady was the cause of his frequent absences from home. Now it
6191,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"was not his love for another, but the teazing jealousy of his wife's"
6192,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"temper, that often obliged Antipholis to leave his home; and (the"
6193,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,abbess suspecting this from the vehemence of Adriana's manner) to
6194,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"learn the truth, she said, ""You should have reprehended him for this."""
6195,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"""Why, so I did,"" replied Adriana. ""Aye,"" said the abbess, ""but perhaps"
6196,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"not enough."" Adriana, willing to convince the abbess that she had said"
6197,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"enough to Antipholis on this subject, replied, ""It was the constant"
6198,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,subject of our conversation: in bed I would not let him sleep for
6199,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,speaking of it. At table I would not let him eat for speaking of it.
6200,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"When I was alone with him, I talked of nothing else; and in company I"
6201,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,gave him frequent hints of it. Still all my talk was how vile and bad
6202,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"it was in him to love any lady better than me."""
6203,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6204,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"The lady abbess, having drawn this full confession from the jealous"
6205,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Adriana, now said, ""And therefore comes it that your husband is mad."
6206,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,The venomous clamour of a jealous woman is a more deadly poison than
6207,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,a mad dog's tooth. It seems his sleep was hindered by your railing;
6208,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,no wonder that his head is light; and his meat was sauced with your
6209,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"upbraidings; unquiet meals make ill digestions, and that has thrown"
6210,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,him into this fever. You say his sports were disturbed by your
6211,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"brawls; being debarred from the enjoyment of society and recreation,"
6212,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,what could ensue but dull melancholy and comfortless despair? The
6213,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"consequence is then, that your jealous fits have made your husband"
6214,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"mad."""
6215,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6216,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Luciana would have excused her sister, saying, she always reprehended"
6217,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"her husband mildly; and she said to her sister, ""Why do you hear"
6218,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"these rebukes without answering them?"" But the abbess had made her"
6219,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"so plainly perceive her fault, that she could only answer, ""She has"
6220,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"betrayed me to my own reproof."""
6221,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6222,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Adriana, though ashamed of her own conduct, still insisted on having"
6223,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,her husband delivered up to her; but the abbess would suffer no person
6224,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"to enter her house, nor would she deliver up this unhappy man to the"
6225,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"care of the jealous wife, determining herself to use gentle means for"
6226,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"his recovery, and she retired into her house again, and ordered her"
6227,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,gates to be shut against them.
6228,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6229,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"During the course of this eventful day, in which so many errors had"
6230,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"happened from the likeness the twin brothers bore to each other, old"
6231,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Ægeon's day of grace was passing away, it being now near sunset: and"
6232,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"at sunset he was doomed to die, if he could not pay the money."
6233,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6234,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"The place of his execution was near this convent, and here he arrived"
6235,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,just as the abbess retired into the convent; the duke attending in
6236,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"person, that if any offered to pay the money, he might be present to"
6237,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,pardon him.
6238,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6239,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Adriana stopped this melancholy procession, and cried out to the duke"
6240,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"for justice, telling him that the abbess had refused to deliver up her"
6241,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"lunatic husband to her care. While she was speaking, her real husband"
6242,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"and his servant Dromio, who had got loose, came before the duke to"
6243,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"demand justice, complaining that his wife had confined him on a"
6244,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,false charge of lunacy; and telling in what manner he had broken his
6245,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"bands, and eluded the vigilance of his keepers. Adriana was strangely"
6246,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"surprised to see her husband, when she thought he had been within the"
6247,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,convent.
6248,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6249,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Ægeon seeing his son, concluded this was the son who had left him to"
6250,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,go in search of his mother and his brother; and he felt secure that
6251,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,this dear son would readily pay the money demanded for his ransom.
6252,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"He therefore spoke to Antipholis in words of fatherly affection,"
6253,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,with joyful hope that he should now be released. But to the utter
6254,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"astonishment of Ægeon, his son denied all knowledge of him, as well he"
6255,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"might, for this Antipholis had never seen his father since they were"
6256,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,separated in the storm in his infancy; but while the poor old Ægeon
6257,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"was in vain endeavouring to make his son acknowledge him, thinking"
6258,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,surely that either his griefs and the anxieties he had suffered had so
6259,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"strangely altered him that his son did not know him, or else that he"
6260,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,was ashamed to acknowledge his father in his misery; in the midst of
6261,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"this perplexity, the lady abbess and the other Antipholis and Dromio"
6262,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"came out, and the wondering Adriana saw two husbands and two Dromios"
6263,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,standing before her.
6264,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6265,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"And now these riddling errors, which had so perplexed them all, were"
6266,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,clearly made out. When the duke saw the two Antipholises and the two
6267,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Dromios both so exactly alike, he at once conjectured aright of these"
6268,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"seeming mysteries, for he remembered the story Ægeon had told him in"
6269,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"the morning; and he said, these men must be the two sons of Ægeon and"
6270,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,their twin slaves.
6271,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6272,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,But now an unlooked-for joy indeed completed the history of Ægeon;
6273,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"and the tale he had in the morning told in sorrow, and under sentence"
6274,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"of death, before the setting sun went down was brought to a happy"
6275,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"conclusion, for the venerable lady abbess made herself known to be the"
6276,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"long-lost wife of Ægeon, and the fond mother of the two Antipholises."
6277,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6278,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,When the fishermen took the eldest Antipholis and Dromio away from
6279,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"her, she entered a nunnery, and by her wise and virtuous conduct she"
6280,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"was at length made lady abbess of this convent, and in discharging"
6281,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,the rites of hospitality to an unhappy stranger she had unknowingly
6282,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,protected her own son.
6283,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6284,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,Joyful congratulations and affectionate greetings between these long
6285,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"separated parents and their children, made them for a while forget"
6286,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,that Ægeon was yet under sentence of death; but when they were become
6287,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"a little calm, Antipholis of Ephesus offered the duke the ransom-money"
6288,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"for his father's life; but the duke freely pardoned Ægeon, and would"
6289,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,not take the money. And the duke went with the abbess and her newly
6290,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"found husband and children into the convent, to hear this happy family"
6291,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,discourse at leisure of the blessed ending of their adverse fortunes.
6292,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,And the two Dromios' humble joy must not be forgotten; they had
6293,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"their congratulations and greetings too, and each Dromio pleasantly"
6294,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"complimented his brother on his good looks, being well pleased to see"
6295,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,his own person (as in a glass) shew so handsome in his brother.
6296,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6297,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Adriana had so well profited by the good counsel of her mother-in-law,"
6298,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"that she never after cherished unjust suspicions, or was jealous of"
6299,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,her husband.
6300,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,
6301,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"Antipholis of Syracuse married the fair Luciana, the sister of his"
6302,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"brother's wife; and the good old Ægeon, with his wife and sons, lived"
6303,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,at Ephesus many years. Nor did the unravelling of these perplexities
6304,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"so entirely remove every ground of mistake for the future, but that"
6305,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"sometimes, to remind them of adventures past, comical blunders would"
6306,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"happen, and the one Antipholis, and the one Dromio, be mistaken for"
6307,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,"the other, making altogether a pleasant and diverting Comedy of"
6308,THE COMEDY OF ERRORS,Errors.

6314,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6315,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,(_By Mary Lamb_)
6316,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6317,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6318,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,In the city of Vienna there once reigned a duke of such a mild and
6319,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"gentle temper, that he suffered his subjects to neglect the laws with"
6320,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"impunity; and there was in particular one law, the existence of which"
6321,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"was almost forgotten, the duke never having put it in force during"
6322,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,his whole reign. This was a law dooming any man to the punishment of
6323,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"death, who should live with a woman that was not his wife; and this"
6324,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"law through the lenity of the duke being utterly disregarded, the holy"
6325,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"institution of marriage became neglected, and complaints were every"
6326,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"day made to the duke by the parents of the young ladies in Vienna,"
6327,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"that their daughters had been seduced from their protection, and were"
6328,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,living as the companions of single men.
6329,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6330,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,The good duke perceived with sorrow this growing evil among his
6331,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,subjects; but he thought that a sudden change in himself from the
6332,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"indulgence he had hitherto shewn, to the strict severity requisite to"
6333,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"check this abuse, would make his people (who had hitherto loved him)"
6334,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,consider him as a tyrant: therefore he determined to absent himself a
6335,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"while from his dukedom, and depute another to the full exercise of his"
6336,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"power, that the law against these dishonourable lovers might be put"
6337,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"in effect, without giving offence by an unusual severity in his own"
6338,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,person.
6339,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6340,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Angelo, a man who bore the reputation of a saint in Vienna for his"
6341,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"strict and rigid life, was chosen by the duke as a fit person to"
6342,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,undertake this important charge; and when the duke imparted his design
6343,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"to lord Escalus, his chief counsellor, Escalus said, ""If any man in"
6344,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Vienna be of worth to undergo such ample grace and honour, it is lord"
6345,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Angelo."" And now the duke departed from Vienna under pretence of"
6346,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"making a journey into Poland, leaving Angelo to act as the lord deputy"
6347,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"in his absence; but the duke's absence was only a feigned one, for he"
6348,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"privately returned to Vienna, habited like a friar, with the intent to"
6349,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,watch unseen the conduct of the saintly-seeming Angelo.
6350,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6351,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,It happened just about the time that Angelo was invested with his new
6352,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"dignity, that a gentleman, whose name was Claudio, had seduced a young"
6353,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"lady from her parents; and for this offence, by command of the new"
6354,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"lord deputy, Claudio was taken up and committed to prison, and by"
6355,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"virtue of the old law which had been so long neglected, Angelo"
6356,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,sentenced Claudio to be beheaded. Great interest was made for the
6357,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"pardon of young Claudio, and the good old lord Escalus himself"
6358,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"interceded for him. ""Alas,"" said he, ""this gentleman whom I would"
6359,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"save had an honourable father, for whose sake I pray you pardon the"
6360,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"young man's transgression."" But Angelo replied, ""We must not make a"
6361,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"scare-crow of the law, setting it up to frighten birds of prey, till"
6362,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"custom, finding it harmless, makes it their perch, and not their"
6363,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"terror. Sir, he must die."""
6364,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6365,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Lucio, the friend of Claudio, visited him in the prison, and Claudio"
6366,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"said to him, ""I pray you, Lucio, do me this kind service. Go to my"
6367,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"sister Isabel, who this day proposes to enter the convent of Saint"
6368,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,Clare; acquaint her with the danger of my state; implore her that she
6369,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,make friends with the strict deputy; bid her go herself to Angelo. I
6370,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"have great hopes in that; for she can discourse with prosperous art,"
6371,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"and well she can persuade; besides, there is a speechless dialect in"
6372,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"youthful sorrow, such as moves men."""
6373,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6374,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Isabel, the sister of Claudio, had, as he said, that day entered upon"
6375,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"her noviciate in the convent, and it was her intent after passing"
6376,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"through her probation as a novice, to take the veil, and she was"
6377,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"enquiring of a nun concerning the rules of the convent, when they"
6378,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"heard the voice of Lucio, who, as he entered that religious house,"
6379,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"said, ""Peace be in this place!"" ""Who is it that speaks?"" said Isabel."
6380,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""It is a man's voice,"" replied the nun: ""Gentle Isabel, go to him, and"
6381,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"learn his business; you may, I may not. When you have taken the veil,"
6382,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,you must not speak with men but in the presence of the prioress; then
6383,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"if you speak, you must not shew your face, or if you shew your face,"
6384,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"you must not speak."" ""And have you nuns no farther privileges?"" said"
6385,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Isabel. ""Are not these large enough?"" replied the nun. ""Yes, truly,"""
6386,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"said Isabel: ""I speak not as desiring more, but rather wishing a more"
6387,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"strict restraint upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare."""
6388,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Again they heard the voice of Lucio, and the nun said, ""He calls"
6389,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"again. I pray you answer him."" Isabel then went out to Lucio, and"
6390,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"in answer to his salutation, said, ""Peace and prosperity! Who is it"
6391,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"that calls?"" Then Lucio, approaching her with reverence, said, ""Hail,"
6392,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"virgin, if such you be, as the roses in your cheeks proclaim you are"
6393,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"no less! can you bring me to the sight of Isabel, a novice of this"
6394,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"place, and the fair sister to her unhappy brother Claudio?"" ""Why her"
6395,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"unhappy brother?"" said Isabel, ""let me ask: for I am that Isabel, and"
6396,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"his sister."" ""Fair and gentle lady,"" he replied, ""your brother kindly"
6397,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"greets you by me; he is in prison."" ""Woe is me! for what?"" said"
6398,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Isabel. Lucio then told her, Claudio was imprisoned for seducing a"
6399,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"young maiden. ""Ah,"" said she, ""I fear it is my cousin Juliet."" Juliet"
6400,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"and Isabel were not related, but they called each other cousin in"
6401,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,remembrance of their school-days friendship; and as Isabel knew that
6402,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Juliet loved Claudio, she feared she had been led by her affection for"
6403,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"him into this transgression. ""She it is,"" replied Lucio. ""Why then let"
6404,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"my brother marry Juliet,"" said Isabel. Lucio replied, that Claudio"
6405,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"would gladly marry Juliet, but that the lord deputy had sentenced him"
6406,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"to die for his offence; ""Unless,"" said he, ""you have the grace by your"
6407,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"fair prayer to soften Angelo, and that is my business between you and"
6408,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"your poor brother."" ""Alas,"" said Isabel, ""what poor ability is there"
6409,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"in me to do him good? I doubt I have no power to move Angelo."" ""Our"
6410,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"doubts are traitors,"" said Lucio, ""and make us lose the good we might"
6411,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"often win, by fearing to attempt it. Go to lord Angelo! When maidens"
6412,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"sue, and kneel, and weep, men give like gods."" ""I will see what I can"
6413,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"do,"" said Isabel: ""I will but stay to give the prioress notice of the"
6414,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"affair, and then I will go to Angelo. Commend me to my brother: soon"
6415,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"at night I will send him word of my success."""
6416,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6417,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Isabel hastened to the palace, and threw herself on her knees before"
6418,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Angelo, saying, ""I am a woeful suitor to your honour, if it will"
6419,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"please your honour to hear me."" ""Well, what is your suit?"" said"
6420,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,Angelo. She then made her petition in the most moving terms for her
6421,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"brother's life. But Angelo said, ""Maiden, there is no remedy: your"
6422,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"brother is sentenced, and he must die."" ""O just, but severe law,"" said"
6423,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Isabel: ""I had a brother then--Heaven keep your honour!"" and she was"
6424,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"about to depart. But Lucio, who had accompanied her, said, ""Give it"
6425,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"not over so; return to him again, intreat him, kneel down before him,"
6426,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"hang upon his gown. You are too cold; if you should need a pin, you"
6427,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"could not with a more tame tongue desire it."" Then again Isabel on"
6428,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"her knees implored for mercy. ""He is sentenced,"" said Angelo: ""it is"
6429,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"too late."" ""Too late!"" said Isabel: ""Why, no; I that do speak a word"
6430,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"may call it back again. Believe this, my lord, no ceremony that to"
6431,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"great ones belongs, not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword, the"
6432,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe, becomes them with one half"
6433,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"so good a grace as mercy does."" ""Pray you begone,"" said Angelo. But"
6434,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"still Isabel intreated; and she said, ""If my brother had been as you,"
6435,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"and you as he, you might have slipt like him, but he like you would"
6436,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"not have been so stern. I would to Heaven I had your power, and you"
6437,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"were Isabel. Should it then be thus? No, I would tell you what it"
6438,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"were to be a judge, and what a prisoner."" ""Be content, fair maid!"""
6439,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"said Angelo: ""it is the law, not I, condemns your brother. Were he my"
6440,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"kinsman, my brother, or my son, it should be thus with him. He must"
6441,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"die to-morrow."" ""To-morrow?"" said Isabel; ""Oh that is sudden: spare"
6442,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"him, spare him; he is not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens we"
6443,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,kill the fowl in season; shall we serve Heaven with less respect than
6444,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"we minister to our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you, none"
6445,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"have died for my brother's offence, though many have committed it. So"
6446,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"you would be the first that gives this sentence, and he the first that"
6447,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"suffers it. Go to your own bosom, my lord; knock there, and ask your"
6448,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,heart what it does know that is like my brother's fault; if it confess
6449,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"a natural guiltiness, as such as his is, let it not sound a thought"
6450,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"against my brother's life!"" Her last words more moved Angelo than all"
6451,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"she had before said, for the beauty of Isabel had raised a guilty"
6452,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"passion in his heart, and he began to form thoughts of dishonourable"
6453,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"love, such as Claudio's crime had been; and the conflict in his mind"
6454,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"made him to turn away from Isabel: but she called him back, saying,"
6455,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""Gentle my lord, turn back; hark, how I will bribe you. Good my lord,"
6456,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"turn back!"" ""How, bribe me!"" said Angelo, astonished that she should"
6457,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"think of offering him a bribe. ""Aye,"" said Isabel, ""with such gifts"
6458,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"that Heaven itself shall share with you; not with golden treasures, or"
6459,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"those glittering stones, whose price is either rich or poor as fancy"
6460,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"values them, but with true prayers that shall be up to Heaven before"
6461,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"sunrise--prayers from preserved souls, from fasting maids whose minds"
6462,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"are dedicated to nothing temporal."" ""Well, come to me to-morrow,"" said"
6463,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Angelo. And for this short respite of her brother's life, and for this"
6464,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"permission that she might be heard again, she left him with the joyful"
6465,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,hope that she should at last prevail over his stern nature: and as she
6466,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"went away, she said, ""Heaven keep your honour safe! Heaven save your"
6467,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"honour!"" Which when Angelo heard, he said within his heart, ""Amen, I"
6468,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"would be saved from thee and from thy virtues:"" and then, affrighted"
6469,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"at his own evil thoughts, he said, ""What is this! What is this? Do I"
6470,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"love her, that I desire to hear her speak again, and feast upon her"
6471,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"eyes? What is it I dream on? The cunning enemy of mankind, to catch a"
6472,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"saint, with saints does bait the hook. Never could an immodest woman"
6473,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"once stir my temper, but this virtuous woman subdues me quite. Even"
6474,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"till now, when men were fond, I smiled, and wondered at them."""
6475,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6476,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"In the guilty conflict in his mind Angelo suffered more that night,"
6477,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,than the prisoner he had so severely sentenced; for in the prison
6478,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Claudio was visited by the good duke, who in his friar's habit"
6479,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"taught the young man the way to Heaven, preaching to him the words"
6480,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,of penitence and peace. But Angelo felt all the pangs of irresolute
6481,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,guilt: now wishing to seduce Isabel from the paths of innocence and
6482,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"honour, and now suffering remorse and horror for a crime as yet but"
6483,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,intentional. But in the end his evil thoughts prevailed; and he who
6484,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,had so lately started at the offer of a bribe resolved to tempt this
6485,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"maiden with so high a bribe, as she might not be able to resist, even"
6486,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,with the precious gift of her dear brother's life.
6487,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6488,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"When Isabel came in the morning, Angelo desired she might be admitted"
6489,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"alone to his presence; and being there, he said to her, if she would"
6490,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"yield to him her virgin honour, and transgress even as Juliet had done"
6491,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"with Claudio, he would give her her brother's life: ""for,"" said he,"
6492,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""I love you, Isabel."" ""My brother,"" said Isabel, ""did so love Juliet,"
6493,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"and yet you tell me he shall die for it."" ""But,"" said Angelo, ""Claudio"
6494,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"shall not die, if you will consent to visit me by stealth at night,"
6495,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"even as Juliet left her father's house at night to come to Claudio."""
6496,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Isabel in amazement at his words, that he should tempt her to the same"
6497,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"fault for which he passed sentence of death upon her brother, said,"
6498,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""I would do as much for my poor brother as for myself; that is, were"
6499,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"I under sentence of death, the impression of keen whips I would wear"
6500,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"as rubies, and go to my death as to a bed that longing I had been sick"
6501,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"for, ere I would yield myself up to this shame."" And then she told"
6502,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"him, she hoped he only spoke these words to try her virtue. But he"
6503,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"said, ""Believe me on my honour, my words express my purpose."" Isabel,"
6504,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,angered to the heart to hear him use the word Honour to express such
6505,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"dishonourable purposes, said, ""Ha! little honour, to be much believed;"
6506,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"and most pernicious purpose. I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for"
6507,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"it! Sign me a present pardon for my brother, or I will tell the world"
6508,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"aloud what man thou art!"" ""Who will believe you, Isabel?"" said Angelo:"
6509,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""my unsoiled name, the austereness of my life, my word vouched against"
6510,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"yours, will outweigh your accusation. Redeem your brother by yielding"
6511,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"to my will, or he shall die to-morrow. As for you, say what you can,"
6512,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"my false will overweigh your true story. Answer me to-morrow."""
6513,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6514,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""To whom should I complain? Did I tell this, who would believe me?"""
6515,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"said Isabel, as she went towards the dreary prison where her brother"
6516,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"was confined. When she arrived there, her brother was in pious"
6517,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"conversation with the duke, who in his friar's habit had also visited"
6518,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Juliet, and brought both these guilty lovers to a proper sense"
6519,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,of their fault; and unhappy Juliet with tears and a true remorse
6520,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"confessed, that she was more to blame than Claudio, in that she"
6521,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,willingly consented to his dishonourable solicitations.
6522,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6523,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"As Isabel entered the room where Claudio was confined, she said,"
6524,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""Peace be here, Grace, and good company!"" ""Who is there?"" said the"
6525,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"disguised duke: ""come in; the wish deserves a welcome."" ""My business"
6526,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"is a word or two with Claudio,"" said Isabel. Then the duke left"
6527,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"them together, and desired the provost, who had the charge of the"
6528,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"prisoners, to place him where he might overhear their conversation."
6529,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6530,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""Now, sister, what is the comfort?"" said Claudio. Isabel told him"
6531,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"he must prepare for death on the morrow. ""Is there no remedy?"" said"
6532,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Claudio. ""Yes, brother,"" replied Isabel, ""there is; but such a one,"
6533,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"as if you consented to it would strip your honour from you, and leave"
6534,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"you naked."" ""Let me know the point,"" said Claudio. ""O, I do fear you,"
6535,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Claudio!"" replied his sister; ""and I quake, lest you should wish to"
6536,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"live, and more respect the trifling term of six or seven winters added"
6537,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"to your life, than your perpetual honour! Do you dare to die? The"
6538,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"sense of death is most in apprehension, and the poor beetle that we"
6539,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"tread upon, feels a pang as great as when a giant dies."" ""Why do you"
6540,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"give me this shame?"" said Claudio. ""Think you I can fetch a resolution"
6541,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"from flowery tenderness? If I must die, I will encounter darkness as a"
6542,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"bride, and hug it in my arms."" ""There spoke my brother,"" said Isabel;"
6543,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""there my father's grave did utter forth a voice. Yes, you must die;"
6544,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"yet, would you think it, Claudio! this outward-sainted deputy, if I"
6545,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"would yield to him my virgin honour, would grant your life. O, were"
6546,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"it but my life, I would lay it down for your deliverance as frankly"
6547,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"as a pin!"" ""Thanks, dear Isabel!"" said Claudio. ""Be ready to die"
6548,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"to-morrow,"" said Isabel. ""Death is a fearful thing,"" said Claudio."
6549,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""And shamed life a hateful,"" replied his sister. But the thoughts of"
6550,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"death now overcame the constancy of Claudio's temper, and terrors,"
6551,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"such as the guilty only at their deaths do know, assailing him, he"
6552,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"cried out, ""Sweet sister, let me live! The sin you do to save a"
6553,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"brother's life, nature dispenses with the deed so far, that it becomes"
6554,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"a virtue."" ""O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!"" said Isabel:"
6555,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""would you preserve your life by your sister's shame? O fie, fie, fie!"
6556,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"I thought, my brother, you had in you such a mind of honour, that had"
6557,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"you twenty heads to render up on twenty blocks, you would have yielded"
6558,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"them up all, before your sister should stoop to such dishonour."" ""Nay,"
6559,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"hear me, Isabel!"" said Claudio. But what he would have said in defence"
6560,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"of his weakness, in desiring to live by the dishonour of his virtuous"
6561,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"sister, was interrupted by the entrance of the duke; who said,"
6562,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""Claudio, I have overheard what has past between you and your sister."
6563,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; what he said, has only"
6564,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,been to make trial of her virtue. She having the truth of honour in
6565,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"her, has given him that gracious denial which he is most glad to"
6566,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,receive. There is no hope that he will pardon you; therefore pass your
6567,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"hours in prayer, and make ready for death."" Then Claudio repented of"
6568,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"his weakness, and said, ""Let me ask my sister's pardon! I am so out of"
6569,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"love with life, that I will sue to be rid of it."" And Claudio retired,"
6570,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,overwhelmed with shame and sorrow for his fault.
6571,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6572,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"The duke being now alone with Isabel, commended her virtuous"
6573,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"resolution, saying, ""The hand that made you fair, has made you good."""
6574,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""O,"" said Isabel, ""how much is the good duke deceived in Angelo!"
6575,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"if ever he return, and I can speak to him, I will discover his"
6576,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"government."" Isabel knew not that she was even now making the"
6577,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"discovery she threatened. The duke replied, ""That shall not be"
6578,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"much amiss; yet as the matter now stands, Angelo will repel your"
6579,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,accusation; therefore lend an attentive ear to my advisings. I believe
6580,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,that you may most righteously do a poor wronged lady a merited
6581,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"benefit, redeem your brother from the angry law, do no stain to"
6582,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"your own most gracious person, and much please the absent duke, if"
6583,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"peradventure he shall ever return to have notice of this business."""
6584,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Isabel said, She had a spirit to do anything he desired, provided it"
6585,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"was nothing wrong. ""Virtue is bold, and never fearful,"" said the duke:"
6586,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"and then he asked her, if she had ever heard of Mariana, the sister"
6587,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"of Frederick, the great soldier who was drowned at sea. ""I have heard"
6588,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"of the lady,"" said Isabel, ""and good words went with her name."" ""This"
6589,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"lady,"" said the duke, ""is the wife of Angelo; but her marriage dowry"
6590,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"was on board the vessel in which her brother perished, and mark how"
6591,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman! for, beside the loss of"
6592,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"a most noble and renowned brother, who in his love towards her was"
6593,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"ever most kind and natural, in the wreck of her fortune she lost the"
6594,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"affections of her husband, the well-seeming Angelo; who pretending to"
6595,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,discover some dishonour in this honourable lady (though the true cause
6596,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"was the loss of her dowry) left her in her tears, and dried not one"
6597,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"of them with his comfort. His unjust unkindness, that in all reason"
6598,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"should have quenched her love, has, like an impediment in the current,"
6599,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"made it more unruly, and Mariana loves her cruel husband with the"
6600,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"full continuance of her first affection."" The duke then more plainly"
6601,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"unfolded his plan. It was, that Isabel should go to lord Angelo, and"
6602,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"seemingly consent to come to him as he desired, at midnight; that by"
6603,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,this means she would obtain the promised pardon; and that Mariana
6604,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"should go in her stead to the appointment, and pass herself upon"
6605,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Angelo in the dark for Isabel. ""Nor, gentle daughter,"" said the"
6606,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"feigned friar, ""fear you to do this thing; Angelo is her husband,"
6607,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"and to bring them thus together is no sin."" Isabel being pleased"
6608,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"with this project, departed to do as he directed her; and he went to"
6609,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,apprize Mariana of their intention. He had before this time visited
6610,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"this unhappy lady in his assumed character, giving her religious"
6611,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"instruction and friendly consolation, at which times he had learned"
6612,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"her sad story from her own lips; and now she, looking upon him as a"
6613,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"holy man, readily consented to be directed by him in this undertaking."
6614,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6615,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"When Isabel returned from her interview with Angelo, to the house of"
6616,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Mariana, where the duke had appointed her to meet him, he said, ""Well"
6617,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"met, and in good time; what is the news from this good deputy?"" Isabel"
6618,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"related the manner in which she had settled the affair. ""Angelo,"" said"
6619,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"she, ""has a garden surrounded with a brick wall, on the western side"
6620,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"of which is a vineyard, and to that vineyard is a gate."" And then she"
6621,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,shewed to the duke and Mariana two keys that Angelo had given her;
6622,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"and she said, ""This bigger key opens the vineyard gate; this other a"
6623,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,little door which leads from the vineyard to the garden. There I have
6624,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"made my promise at the dead of the night to call upon him, and have"
6625,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,got from him his word of assurance for my brother's life. I have taken
6626,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,a due and wary note of the place; and with whispering and most guilty
6627,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"diligence he shewed me the way twice over."" ""Are there no other tokens"
6628,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"agreed upon between you, that Mariana must observe?"" said the duke."
6629,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""No, none,"" said Isabel, ""only to go when it is dark. I have told him"
6630,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,my time can be but short; for I have made him think a servant comes
6631,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"along with me, and that this servant is persuaded I come about my"
6632,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"brother."" The duke commended her discreet management, and she turning"
6633,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"to Mariana, said, ""Little have you to say to Angelo, when you depart"
6634,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"from him, but soft and low _Remember now my brother!_"""
6635,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6636,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Mariana was that night conducted to the appointed place by Isabel, who"
6637,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"rejoiced that she had, as she supposed, by this device preserved both"
6638,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,her brother's life and her own honour. But that her brother's life was
6639,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"safe the duke was not so well satisfied, and therefore at midnight he"
6640,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"again repaired to the prison, and it was well for Claudio that he did"
6641,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"so, else would Claudio have that night been beheaded; for soon after"
6642,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"the duke entered the prison, an order came from the cruel deputy"
6643,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"commanding that Claudio should be beheaded, and his head sent to him"
6644,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,by five o'clock in the morning. But the duke persuaded the provost to
6645,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"put off the execution of Claudio, and to deceive Angelo by sending him"
6646,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,the head of a man who died that morning in the prison. And to prevail
6647,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"upon the provost to agree to this, the duke, whom still the provost"
6648,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"suspected not to be any thing more or greater than he seemed, shewed"
6649,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"the provost a letter written with the duke's hand, and sealed with his"
6650,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"seal, which when the provost saw, he concluded this friar must have"
6651,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"some secret order from the absent duke, and therefore he consented to"
6652,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"spare Claudio; and he cut off the dead man's head, and carried it to"
6653,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,Angelo.
6654,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6655,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Then the duke, in his own name, wrote to Angelo a letter, saying that"
6656,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"certain accidents had put a stop to his journey, and that he should be"
6657,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"in Vienna by the following morning, requiring Angelo to meet him at"
6658,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"the entrance of the city, there to deliver up his authority; and the"
6659,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"duke also commanded it to be proclaimed, that if any of his subjects"
6660,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"craved redress for injustice, they should exhibit their petitions in"
6661,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,the street on his first entrance into the city.
6662,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6663,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Early in the morning Isabel came to the prison, and the duke, who"
6664,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"there awaited her coming, for secret reasons thought it good to tell"
6665,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,her that Claudio was beheaded; therefore when Isabel enquired if
6666,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Angelo had sent the pardon for her brother, he said, ""Angelo has"
6667,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"released Claudio from this world. His head is off, and sent to the"
6668,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"deputy."" The much-grieved sister cried out, ""O unhappy Claudio,"
6669,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"wretched Isabel, injurious world, most wicked Angelo!"" The seeming"
6670,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"friar bid her take comfort, and when she was become a little calm, he"
6671,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"acquainted her with the near prospect of the duke's return, and told"
6672,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,her in what manner she should proceed in preferring her complaint
6673,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,against Angelo; and he bade her not to fear if the cause should seem
6674,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"to go against her for a while. Leaving Isabel sufficiently instructed,"
6675,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"he next went to Mariana, and gave her counsel in what manner she also"
6676,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,should act.
6677,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6678,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Then the duke laid aside his friar's habit, and in his own royal"
6679,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"robes, amidst a joyful crowd of his faithful subjects assembled to"
6680,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"greet his arrival, entered the city of Vienna, where he was met by"
6681,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Angelo, who delivered up his authority in the proper form. And there"
6682,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"came Isabel, in the manner of a petitioner for redress, and said,"
6683,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""Justice, most royal duke! I am the sister of one Claudio, who for the"
6684,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,seducing a young maid was condemned to lose his head. I made my suit
6685,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,to lord Angelo for my brother's pardon. It were needless to tell your
6686,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"grace how I prayed and kneeled, how he repelled me, and how I replied;"
6687,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,for this was of much length. The vile conclusion I now begin with
6688,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,grief and shame to utter. Angelo would not but by my yielding to his
6689,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,dishonourable love release my brother; and after much debate within
6690,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"myself, my sisterly remorse overcame my virtue, and I did yield to"
6691,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"him. But the next morning betimes Angelo, forfeiting his promise, sent"
6692,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"a warrant for my poor brother's head!"" The duke affected to disbelieve"
6693,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"her story; and Angelo said that grief for her brother's death, who had"
6694,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"suffered by the due course of the law, had disordered her senses. And"
6695,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"now another suitor approached, which was Mariana; and Mariana said,"
6696,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""Noble prince, as there comes light from heaven, and truth from"
6697,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"breath, as there is sense in truth, and truth in virtue, I am this"
6698,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"man's wife, and, my good lord, the words of Isabel are false, for the"
6699,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"night she says she was with Angelo, I passed that night with him in"
6700,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"the garden-house. As this is true, let me in safety rise, or else for"
6701,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"ever be fixed here a marble monument."" Then did Isabel appeal for the"
6702,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"truth of what she had said to friar Lodowick, that being the name the"
6703,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,duke had assumed in his disguise. Isabel and Mariana had both obeyed
6704,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"his instructions in what they said, the duke intending that the"
6705,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,innocence of Isabel should be plainly proved in that public manner
6706,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,before the whole city of Vienna; but Angelo little thought that it was
6707,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"from such a cause that they thus differed in their story, and he hoped"
6708,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,from their contradictory evidence to be able to clear himself from
6709,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"the accusation of Isabel; and he said, assuming a look of offended"
6710,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"innocence, ""I did but smile till now; but, good my lord, my patience"
6711,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"here is touched, and I perceive these poor distracted women are but"
6712,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"the instruments of some greater one, who sets them on. Let me have"
6713,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"way, my lord, to find this practice out."" ""Aye, with all my heart,"""
6714,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"said the duke, ""and punish them to the height of your pleasure. You,"
6715,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"lord Escalus, sit with lord Angelo, lend him your pains to discover"
6716,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"this abuse; the friar is sent for that set them on, and when he comes,"
6717,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,do with your injuries as may seem best in any chastisement. I for a
6718,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"while will leave you, but stir not you, lord Angelo, till you have"
6719,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"well determined upon this slander."" The duke then went away, leaving"
6720,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,Angelo well pleased to be deputed judge and umpire in his own cause.
6721,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,But the duke was absent only while he threw off his royal robes and
6722,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,put on his friar's habit; and in that disguise again he presented
6723,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"himself before Angelo and Escalus: and the good old Escalus, who"
6724,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"thought Angelo had been falsely accused, said to the supposed friar,"
6725,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""Come, sir, did you set these women on to slander lord Angelo?"" He"
6726,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"replied, ""Where is the duke? It is he should hear me speak."" Escalus"
6727,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"said, ""The duke is in us, and we will hear you. Speak justly."" ""Boldly"
6728,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"at least,"" retorted the friar; and then he blamed the duke for leaving"
6729,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"the cause of Isabel in the hands of him she had accused, and spoke so"
6730,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"freely of many corrupt practices he had observed, while, as he said,"
6731,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"he had been a looker-on in Vienna, that Escalus threatened him with"
6732,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"the torture for speaking words against the state, and for censuring"
6733,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"the conduct of the duke, and ordered him to be taken away to prison."
6734,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Then, to the amazement of all present, and to the utter confusion of"
6735,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Angelo, the supposed friar threw off his disguise, and they saw it was"
6736,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,the duke himself.
6737,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,
6738,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"The duke first addressed Isabel. He said to her, ""Come hither, Isabel."
6739,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Your friar is now your prince, but with my habit I have not changed my"
6740,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"heart. I am still devoted to your service."" ""O give me pardon,"" said"
6741,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Isabel, ""that I, your vassal, have employed and troubled your unknown"
6742,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"sovereignty."" He answered that he had most need of forgiveness from"
6743,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"her, for not having prevented the death of her brother--for not yet"
6744,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,would he tell her that Claudio was living; meaning first to make
6745,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,a farther trial of her goodness. Angelo now knew the duke had
6746,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"been a secret witness of his bad deeds, and he said, ""O my dread"
6747,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"lord, I should be guiltier than my guiltiness, to think I can be"
6748,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"undiscernible, when I perceive your grace, like power divine, has"
6749,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"looked upon my actions. Then, good prince, no longer prolong my shame,"
6750,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,but let my trial be my own confession. Immediate sentence and death
6751,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"is all the grace I beg."" The duke replied, ""Angelo, thy faults are"
6752,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,manifest. We do condemn thee to the very block where Claudio stooped
6753,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"to death; and with like haste away with him; and for his possessions,"
6754,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Mariana, we do enstate and widow you withal, to buy you a better"
6755,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"husband."" ""O my dear lord,"" said Mariana, ""I crave no other, nor no"
6756,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"better man;"" and then on her knees, even as Isabel had begged the"
6757,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"life of Claudio, did this kind wife of an ungrateful husband beg the"
6758,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"life of Angelo; and she said, ""Gentle my liege, O good my lord! Sweet"
6759,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"Isabel, take my part! Lend me your knees, and all my life to come"
6760,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"I will lend you, all my life, to do you service!"" The duke said,"
6761,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"""Against all sense you importune her. Should Isabel kneel down to beg"
6762,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"for mercy, her brother's ghost would break his paved bed, and take her"
6763,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"hence in horror."" Still Mariana said, ""Isabel, sweet Isabel, do but"
6764,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"kneel by me, hold up your hand, say nothing! I will speak all. They"
6765,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"say, best men are moulded out of faults, and for the most part become"
6766,MEASURE FOR MEASURE,"much the better for being a little bad. So may my husband. Oh, Isabel,"

6809,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Sebastian and his sister Viola, a young gentleman and lady of"
6810,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Messaline, were twins, and (which was accounted a great wonder) from"
6811,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","their birth they so much resembled each other, that, but for the"
6812,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","difference in their dress, they could not be known apart. They were"
6813,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","both born in one hour, and in one hour they were both in danger of"
6814,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","perishing, for they were shipwrecked on the coast of Illyria as they"
6815,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","were making a sea-voyage together. The ship, on board of which they"
6816,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","were, split on a rock in a violent storm, and a very small number"
6817,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",of the ship's company escaped with their lives. The captain of the
6818,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","vessel, with a few of the sailors that were saved, got to land in a"
6819,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","small boat, and with them they brought Viola safe on shore, where"
6820,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","she, poor lady, instead of rejoicing at her own deliverance, began"
6821,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",to lament her brother's loss; but the captain comforted her with the
6822,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","assurance, that he had seen her brother, when the ship split, fasten"
6823,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","himself to a strong mast, on which, as long as he could see any thing"
6824,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","of him for the distance, he perceived him borne up above the waves."
6825,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Viola was much consoled by the hope this account gave her, and now"
6826,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","considered how she was to dispose of herself in a strange country,"
6827,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",so far from home; and she asked the captain if he knew any thing of
6828,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Illyria. ""Aye, very well, madam,"" replied the captain, ""for I was born"
6829,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","not three hours' travel from this place."" ""Who governs here?"" said"
6830,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Viola. The captain told her, Illyria was governed by Orsino, a duke"
6831,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","noble in nature as well as dignity. Viola said, she had heard her"
6832,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","father speak of Orsino, and that he was unmarried then. ""And he is so"
6833,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","now,"" said the captain; ""or was so very lately, for but a month ago"
6834,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","I went from here, and then it was the general talk (as you know what"
6835,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",great ones do the people will prattle of) that Orsino sought the love
6836,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","of fair Olivia, a virtuous maid, the daughter of a count who died"
6837,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","twelve months ago, leaving Olivia to the protection of her brother,"
6838,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","who shortly after died also; and for the love of this dear brother,"
6839,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","they say, she has abjured the sight and company of men."" Viola, who"
6840,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","was herself in such a sad affliction for her brother's loss, wished"
6841,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","she could live with this lady, who so tenderly mourned a brother's"
6842,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","death. She asked the captain if he could introduce her to Olivia,"
6843,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","saying she would willingly serve this lady. But he replied, this would"
6844,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","be a hard thing to accomplish, because the lady Olivia would admit no"
6845,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","person into her house since her brother's death, not even the duke"
6846,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","himself. Then Viola formed another project in her mind, which was, in"
6847,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",a man's habit to serve the duke Orsino as a page. It was a strange
6848,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","fancy in a young lady to put on male attire, and pass for a boy;"
6849,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","but the forlorn and unprotected state of Viola, who was young and of"
6850,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","uncommon beauty, alone, and in a foreign land, must plead her excuse."
6851,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",
6852,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","She having observed a fair behaviour in the captain, and that he"
6853,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","shewed a friendly concern for her welfare, intrusted him with her"
6854,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","design, and he readily engaged to assist her. Viola gave him money,"
6855,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","and directed him to furnish her with suitable apparel, ordering her"
6856,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",clothes to be made of the same colour and in the same fashion her
6857,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","brother Sebastian used to wear, and when she was dressed in her manly"
6858,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","garb, she looked so exactly like her brother, that some strange errors"
6859,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","happened by means of their being mistaken for each other; for, as will"
6860,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","afterwards appear, Sebastian was also saved."
6861,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",
6862,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Viola's good friend, the captain, when he had transformed this"
6863,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","pretty lady into a gentleman, having some interest at court, got her"
6864,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",presented to Orsino under the feigned name of Cesario. The duke was
6865,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",wonderfully pleased with the address and graceful deportment of this
6866,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","handsome youth, and made Cesario one of his pages, that being the"
6867,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",office Viola wished to obtain: and she so well fulfilled the duties
6868,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","of her new station, and shewed such a ready observance and faithful"
6869,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","attachment to her lord, that she soon became his most favoured"
6870,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",attendant. To Cesario Orsino confided the whole history of his love
6871,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",for the lady Olivia. To Cesario he told the long and unsuccessful suit
6872,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","he had made to one, who, rejecting his long services, and despising"
6873,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","his person, refused to admit him to her presence; and for the love"
6874,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","of this lady who had so unkindly treated him, the noble Orsino,"
6875,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","forsaking the sports of the field, and all manly exercises in which"
6876,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","he used to delight, passed his hours in ignoble sloth, listening to"
6877,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","the effeminate sounds of soft music, gentle airs, and passionate"
6878,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",love-songs; and neglecting the company of the wise and learned lords
6879,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","with whom he used to associate, he was now all day long conversing"
6880,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",with young Cesario. Unmeet companion no doubt his grave courtiers
6881,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","thought Cesario was for their once noble master, the great duke"
6882,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",Orsino.
6883,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",
6884,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",It is a dangerous matter for young maidens to be the confidants of
6885,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","handsome young dukes; which Viola too soon found to her sorrow,"
6886,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","for all that Orsino told her he endured for Olivia, she presently"
6887,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",perceived she suffered for the love of him: and much it moved her
6888,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","wonder, that Olivia could be so regardless of this her peerless lord"
6889,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","and master, whom she thought no one should behold without the deepest"
6890,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","admiration, and she ventured gently to hint to Orsino that it was pity"
6891,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",he should affect a lady who was so blind to his worthy qualities; and
6892,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","she said, ""If a lady were to love you, my lord, as you love Olivia"
6893,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","(and perhaps there may be one who does), if you could not love her in"
6894,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","return, would you not tell her that you could not love, and must not"
6895,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","she be content with this answer?"" But Orsino would not admit of this"
6896,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","reasoning, for he denied that it was possible for any woman to love as"
6897,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","he did. He said, no woman's heart was big enough to hold so much love,"
6898,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","and therefore it was unfair to compare the love of any lady for him,"
6899,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",to his love for Olivia. Now though Viola had the utmost deference for
6900,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","the duke's opinions, she could not help thinking this was not quite"
6901,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","true, for she thought her heart had full as much love in it as"
6902,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Orsino's had; and she said, ""Ah, but I know, my lord.""--""What do you"
6903,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","know, Cesario?"" said Orsino. ""Too well I know,"" replied Viola, ""what"
6904,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",love women may owe to men. They are as true of heart as we are. My
6905,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","father had a daughter loved a man, as I perhaps, were I a woman,"
6906,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","should love your lordship."" ""And what is her history?"" said Orsino."
6907,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","""A blank, my lord,"" replied Viola: ""she never told her love, but let"
6908,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","concealment, like a worm in the bud, prey on her damask cheek. She"
6909,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","pined in thought, and with a green and yellow melancholy, she sat"
6910,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","like Patience on a monument, smiling at grief."" The duke enquired if"
6911,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","this lady died of her love, but to this question Viola returned an"
6912,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","evasive answer; as probably she had feigned the story, to speak words"
6913,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",expressive of the secret love and silent grief she suffered for
6914,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",Orsino.
6915,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",
6916,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","While they were talking, a gentleman entered whom the duke had sent to"
6917,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Olivia, and he said, ""So please you, my lord, I might not be admitted"
6918,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","to the lady, but by her handmaid she returned you this answer: Until"
6919,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","seven years hence, the element itself shall not behold her face; but"
6920,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","like a cloistress she will walk veiled, watering her chamber with her"
6921,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","tears for the sad remembrance of her dead brother."" On hearing this,"
6922,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","the duke exclaimed, ""O she that has a heart of this fine frame, to pay"
6923,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","this debt of love to a dead brother, how will she love, when the rich"
6924,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","golden shaft has touched her heart!"" And then he said to Viola, ""You"
6925,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","know, Cesario, I have told you all the secrets of my heart; therefore,"
6926,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","good youth, go to Olivia's house. Be not denied access; stand at her"
6927,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","doors, and tell her, there your fixed foot shall grow till you have"
6928,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","audience."" ""And if I do speak to her, my lord, what then?"" said Viola."
6929,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","""O then,"" replied Orsino, ""unfold to her the passion of my love. Make"
6930,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",a long discourse to her of my dear faith. It will well become you to
6931,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","act my woes, for she will attend more to you than to one of graver"
6932,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","aspect."""
6933,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",
6934,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",Away then went Viola; but not willingly did she undertake this
6935,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","courtship, for she was to woo a lady to become a wife to him she"
6936,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","wished to marry: but having undertaken the affair, she performed it"
6937,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",with fidelity; and Olivia soon heard that a youth was at her door who
6938,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","insisted upon being admitted to her presence. ""I told him,"" said the"
6939,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","servant, ""that you were sick: he said he knew you were, and therefore"
6940,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",he came to speak with you. I told him that you were asleep; he seemed
6941,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","to have a foreknowledge of that too, and said, that therefore he"
6942,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","must speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? for he seems"
6943,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","fortified against all denial, and will speak with you, whether you"
6944,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","will or no."" Olivia, curious to see who this peremptory messenger"
6945,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","might be, desired he might be admitted; and throwing her veil over her"
6946,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","face, she said she would once more hear Orsino's embassy, not doubting"
6947,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","but that he came from the duke, by his importunity. Viola entering,"
6948,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","put on the most manly air she could assume, and affecting the fine"
6949,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","courtier's language of great men's pages, she said to the veiled lady,"
6950,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","""Most radiant, exquisite, and matchless beauty, I pray you tell me if"
6951,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",you are the lady of the house; for I should be sorry to cast away my
6952,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","speech upon another; for besides that it is excellently well penned,"
6953,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","I have taken great pains to learn it."" ""Whence come you, sir?"" said"
6954,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Olivia. ""I can say little more than I have studied,"" replied Viola;"
6955,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","""and that question is out of my part."" ""Are you a comedian?"" said"
6956,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Olivia. ""No,"" replied Viola; ""and yet I am not that which I play;"""
6957,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","meaning, that she being a woman, feigned herself to be a man. And"
6958,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",again she asked Olivia if she were the lady of the house. Olivia said
6959,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","she was; and then Viola, having more curiosity to see her rival's"
6960,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","features than haste to deliver her master's message, said, ""Good"
6961,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","madam, let me see your face."" With this bold request Olivia was not"
6962,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","averse to comply; for this haughty beauty, whom the Duke Orsino had"
6963,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","loved so long in vain, at first sight conceived a passion for the"
6964,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","supposed page, the humble Cesario."
6965,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",
6966,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","When Viola asked to see her face, Olivia said, ""Have you any"
6967,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","commission from your lord and master to negotiate with my face?"" And"
6968,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","then, forgetting her determination to go veiled for seven long years,"
6969,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","she drew aside her veil, saying, ""But I will draw the curtain and shew"
6970,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","the picture. Is it not well done?"" Viola replied, ""It is beauty truly"
6971,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",mixed; the red and white upon your cheeks is by Nature's own cunning
6972,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","hand laid on. You are the most cruel lady living, if you will lead"
6973,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","these graces to the grave, and leave the world no copy."" ""O sir,"""
6974,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","replied Olivia, ""I will not be so cruel. The world may have an"
6975,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","inventory of my beauty. As, _item_, two lips, indifferent red; _item_,"
6976,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","two grey eyes, with lids to them; one neck; one chin, and so forth."
6977,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Were you sent here to praise me?"" Viola replied, ""I see you what you"
6978,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","are: you are too proud, but you are fair. My lord and master loves"
6979,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","you. O such a love could but be recompensed, though you were crowned"
6980,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",the queen of beauty: for Orsino loves you with adoration and with
6981,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","tears, with groans that thunder love, and sighs of fire."" ""Your lord,"""
6982,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","said Olivia, ""knows well my mind. I cannot love him; yet I doubt not"
6983,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","he is virtuous; I know him to be noble and of high estate, of fresh"
6984,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","and spotless youth. All voices proclaim him learned, courteous, and"
6985,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","valiant; yet I cannot love him, he might have taken his answer long"
6986,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","ago."" ""If I did love you as my master does,"" said Viola, ""I would make"
6987,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","me a willow cabin at your gates, and call upon your name. I would"
6988,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","write complaining sonnets on Olivia, and sing them in the dead of the"
6989,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","night; your name should sound among the hills, and I would make Echo,"
6990,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","the babbling gossip of the air, cry out _Olivia_. O you should not"
6991,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","rest between the elements of earth and air, but you should pity me."""
6992,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","""You might do much,"" said Olivia: ""what is your parentage?"" Viola"
6993,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","replied, ""Above my fortunes, yet my state is well. I am a gentleman."""
6994,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Olivia now reluctantly dismissed Viola, saying, ""Go to your master,"
6995,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","and tell him, I cannot love him. Let him send no more, unless"
6996,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","perchance you come again to tell me how he takes it."" And Viola"
6997,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","departed, bidding the lady farewel by the name of Fair Cruelty. When"
6998,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","she was gone, Olivia repeated the words, _Above my fortunes, yet my"
6999,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","state is well. I am a gentleman_. And she said aloud, ""I will be sworn"
7000,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","he is; his tongue, his face, his limbs, action, and spirit, plainly"
7001,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","shew he is a gentleman."" And then she wished Cesario was the duke; and"
7002,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","perceiving the fast hold he had taken on her affections, she blamed"
7003,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",herself for her sudden love: but the gentle blame which people lay
7004,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",upon their own faults has no deep root: and presently the noble lady
7005,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",Olivia so far forgot the inequality between her fortunes and those of
7006,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","this seeming page, as well as the maidenly reserve which is the chief"
7007,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","ornament of a lady's character, that she resolved to court the love of"
7008,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","young Cesario, and sent a servant after him with a diamond ring, under"
7009,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",the pretence that he had left it with her as a present from Orsino.
7010,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","She hoped, by thus artfully making Cesario a present of the ring, she"
7011,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",should give him some intimation of her design; and truly it did make
7012,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Viola suspect; for knowing that Orsino had sent no ring by her, she"
7013,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",began to recollect that Olivia's looks and manner were expressive of
7014,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","admiration, and she presently guessed her master's mistress had fallen"
7015,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","in love with her. ""Alas,"" said she, ""the poor lady might as well love"
7016,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","a dream. Disguise I see is wicked, for it has caused Olivia to breathe"
7017,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","as fruitless sighs for me, as I do for Orsino."""
7018,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",
7019,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Viola returned to Orsino's palace, and related to her lord the ill"
7020,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","success of the negociation, repeating the command of Olivia, that"
7021,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",the duke should trouble her no more. Yet still the duke persisted in
7022,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL",hoping that the gentle Cesario would in time be able to persuade her
7023,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","to shew some pity, and therefore he bade him he should go to her again"
7024,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","the next day. In the mean time, to pass away the tedious interval,"
7025,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","he commanded a song which he loved to be sung; and he said, ""My good"
7026,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","Cesario, when I heard that song last night, methought it did relieve"
7027,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","my passion much. Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain. The spinsters"
7028,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","and the knitters when they sit in the sun, and the young maids that"
7029,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","weave their thread with bone, chaunt this song. It is silly, yet I"
7030,"TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL","love it, for it tells of the innocence of love in the old times."""

7037,SONG,I am slain by a fair cruel maid.

7045,SONG,"A thousand thousand sighs to save, lay me O where"
7046,SONG,"Sad true lover never find my grave, to weep there."
7047,SONG,
7048,SONG,"Viola did not fail to mark the words of the old song, which in such"
7049,SONG,"true simplicity described the pangs of unrequited love, and she bore"
7050,SONG,testimony in her countenance of feeling what the song expressed. Her
7051,SONG,"sad looks were observed by Orsino, who said to her, ""My life upon it,"
7052,SONG,"Cesario, though you are so young, your eye has looked upon some face"
7053,SONG,"that it loves; has it not, boy?"" ""A little, with your leave,"" replied"
7054,SONG,"Viola. ""And what kind of woman, and of what age is she?"" said Orsino."
7055,SONG,"""Of your age, and of your complexion, my lord,"" said Viola; which made"
7056,SONG,the duke smile to hear this fair young boy loved a woman so much older
7057,SONG,"than himself, and of a man's dark complexion; but Viola secretly meant"
7058,SONG,"Orsino, and not a woman like him."
7059,SONG,
7060,SONG,"When Viola made her second visit to Olivia, she found no difficulty"
7061,SONG,in gaining access to her. Servants soon discover when their ladies
7062,SONG,delight to converse with handsome young messengers; and the instant
7063,SONG,"Viola arrived, the gates were thrown wide open, and the duke's page"
7064,SONG,was shewn into Olivia's apartment with great respect; and when Viola
7065,SONG,"told Olivia that she was come once more to plead in her lord's behalf,"
7066,SONG,"this lady said, ""I desired you never to speak of him again; but if"
7067,SONG,"you would undertake another suit, I had rather hear you solicit, than"
7068,SONG,"music from the spheres."" This was pretty plain speaking, but Olivia"
7069,SONG,"soon explained herself still more plainly, and openly confessed her"
7070,SONG,love; and when she saw displeasure with perplexity expressed in
7071,SONG,"Viola's face, she said, ""O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful in the"
7072,SONG,"contempt and anger of his lip! Cesario, by the roses of the spring, by"
7073,SONG,"maidhood, honour, and by truth, I love you so, that, in spite of your"
7074,SONG,"pride, I have neither wit nor reason to conceal my passion."" But in"
7075,SONG,"vain the lady wooed; Viola hastened from her presence, threatening"
7076,SONG,never more to come to plead Orsino's love; and all the reply she made
7077,SONG,"to Olivia's fond solicitation was, a declaration of a resolution"
7078,SONG,_Never to love any woman_.
7079,SONG,
7080,SONG,No sooner had Viola left the lady than a claim was made upon her
7081,SONG,"valour. A gentleman, a rejected suitor of Olivia, who had learned how"
7082,SONG,"that lady had favoured the duke's messenger, challenged him to fight"
7083,SONG,"a duel. What should poor Viola do, who, though she carried a manlike"
7084,SONG,"outside, had a true woman's heart, and feared to look on her own"
7085,SONG,sword!
7086,SONG,
7087,SONG,When she saw her formidable rival advancing towards her with his sword
7088,SONG,"drawn, she began to think of confessing that she was a woman; but"
7089,SONG,"she was relieved at once from her terror, and the shame of such a"
7090,SONG,"discovery, by a stranger that was passing by, who made up to them, and"
7091,SONG,"as if he had been long known to her, and were her dearest friend, said"
7092,SONG,"to her opponent, ""If this young gentleman has done offence, I will"
7093,SONG,"take the fault on me; and if you offend him, I will for his sake defy"
7094,SONG,"you."" Before Viola had time to thank him for his protection, or to"
7095,SONG,"enquire the reason of his kind interference, her new friend met with"
7096,SONG,an enemy where his bravery was of no use to him; for the officers of
7097,SONG,"justice coming up in that instant, apprehended the stranger in the"
7098,SONG,duke's name to answer for an offence he had committed some years
7099,SONG,"before; and he said to Viola, ""This comes with seeking you:"" and then"
7100,SONG,"he asked her for a purse, saying, ""Now my necessity makes me ask for"
7101,SONG,"my purse, and it grieves me much more for what I cannot do for you,"
7102,SONG,"than for what befalls myself. You stand amazed, but be of comfort."""
7103,SONG,"His words did indeed amaze Viola, and she protested she knew him not,"
7104,SONG,nor had ever received a purse from him; but for the kindness he had
7105,SONG,"just shewn her, she offered him a small sum of money, being nearly"
7106,SONG,"the whole she possessed. And now the stranger spoke severe things,"
7107,SONG,"charging her with ingratitude and unkindness. He said, ""This youth,"
7108,SONG,"whom you see here, I snatched from the jaws of death, and for his"
7109,SONG,"sake alone I came to Illyria, and have fallen into this danger."" But"
7110,SONG,the officers cared little for hearkening to the complaints of their
7111,SONG,"prisoner, and they hurried him off, saying, ""What is that to us?"" And"
7112,SONG,"as he was carried away, he called Viola by the name of Sebastian,"
7113,SONG,"reproaching the supposed Sebastian for disowning his friend, as long"
7114,SONG,"as he was within hearing. When Viola heard herself called Sebastian,"
7115,SONG,though the stranger was taken away too hastily for her to ask an
7116,SONG,"explanation, she conjectured that this seeming mystery might arise"
7117,SONG,from her being mistaken for her brother; and she began to cherish
7118,SONG,hopes that it was her brother whose life this man said he had
7119,SONG,"preserved. And so indeed it was. The stranger, whose name was"
7120,SONG,"Anthonio, was a sea-captain. He had taken Sebastian up into his ship,"
7121,SONG,"when, almost exhausted with fatigue, he was floating on the mast"
7122,SONG,to which he had fastened himself in the storm. Anthonio conceived
7123,SONG,"such a friendship for Sebastian, that he resolved to accompany him"
7124,SONG,whithersoever he went; and when the youth expressed a curiosity to
7125,SONG,"visit Orsino's court, Anthonio, rather than part from him, came to"
7126,SONG,"Illyria, though he knew, if his person should be known there, his life"
7127,SONG,"would be in danger, because in a sea-fight he had once dangerously"
7128,SONG,wounded the duke Orsino's nephew. This was the offence for which he
7129,SONG,was now made a prisoner.
7130,SONG,
7131,SONG,Anthonio and Sebastian had landed together but a few hours before
7132,SONG,"Anthonio met Viola. He had given his purse to Sebastian, desiring him"
7133,SONG,"to use it freely if he saw any thing he wished to purchase, telling"
7134,SONG,"him he would wait at the inn, while Sebastian went to view the town:"
7135,SONG,"but Sebastian not returning at the time appointed, Anthonio had"
7136,SONG,"ventured out to look for him, and Viola being dressed the same, and in"
7137,SONG,"face so exactly resembling her brother, Anthonio drew his sword (as he"
7138,SONG,"thought) in defence of the youth he had saved, and when Sebastian (as"
7139,SONG,"he supposed) disowned him, and denied him his own purse, no wonder he"
7140,SONG,accused him of ingratitude.
7141,SONG,
7142,SONG,"Viola, when Anthonio was gone, fearing a second invitation to fight,"
7143,SONG,"slunk home as fast as she could. She had not been long gone, when her"
7144,SONG,adversary thought he saw her return; but it was her brother Sebastian
7145,SONG,"who happened to arrive at this place, and he said, ""Now, sir, have I"
7146,SONG,"met with you again? There's for you;"" and struck him a blow. Sebastian"
7147,SONG,"was no coward; he returned the blow with interest, and drew his sword."
7148,SONG,
7149,SONG,"A lady now put a stop to this duel, for Olivia came out of the house,"
7150,SONG,"and she too mistaking Sebastian for Cesario, invited him to come into"
7151,SONG,"her house, expressing much sorrow at the rude attack he had met with."
7152,SONG,Though Sebastian was as much surprised at the courtesy of this lady as
7153,SONG,"at the rudeness of his unknown foe, yet he went very willingly into"
7154,SONG,"the house, and Olivia was delighted to find Cesario (as she thought"
7155,SONG,him) become more sensible of her attentions; for though their features
7156,SONG,"were exactly the same, there was none of the contempt and anger to be"
7157,SONG,"seen in his face, which she had complained of when she told her love"
7158,SONG,to Cesario.
7159,SONG,
7160,SONG,Sebastian did not at all object to the fondness the lady lavished on
7161,SONG,"him. He seemed to take it in very good part, yet he wondered how it"
7162,SONG,"had come to pass, and he was rather inclined to think Olivia was not"
7163,SONG,in her right senses; but perceiving that she was mistress of a fine
7164,SONG,"house, and that she ordered her affairs and seemed to govern her"
7165,SONG,"family discreetly, and that in all but her sudden love for him she"
7166,SONG,"appeared in the full possession of her reason, he well approved of the"
7167,SONG,"courtship; and Olivia finding Cesario in this good humour, and fearing"
7168,SONG,"he might change his mind, proposed that, as she had a priest in the"
7169,SONG,"house, they should be instantly married. Sebastian assented to this"
7170,SONG,"proposal; and when the marriage-ceremony was over, he left his lady"
7171,SONG,"for a short time, intending to go and tell his friend Anthonio the"
7172,SONG,good fortune that he had met with. In the mean time Orsino came to
7173,SONG,"visit Olivia; and at the moment he arrived before Olivia's house, the"
7174,SONG,"officers of justice brought their prisoner, Anthonio, before the duke."
7175,SONG,"Viola was with Orsino, her master; and when Anthonio saw Viola, whom"
7176,SONG,"he still imagined to be Sebastian, he told the duke in what manner he"
7177,SONG,had rescued this youth from the perils of the sea; and after fully
7178,SONG,"relating all the kindness he had really shewn to Sebastian, he ended"
7179,SONG,"his complaint by saying, that for three months, both day and night,"
7180,SONG,this ungrateful youth had been with him. But now the lady Olivia
7181,SONG,"coming forth from her house, the duke could no longer attend to"
7182,SONG,"Anthonio's story; and he said, ""Here comes the countess: now Heaven"
7183,SONG,"walks on earth! but for thee, fellow, thy words are madness. Three"
7184,SONG,"months has this youth attended on me:"" and then he ordered Anthonio"
7185,SONG,to be taken aside. But Orsino's heavenly countess soon gave the duke
7186,SONG,"cause to accuse Cesario as much of ingratitude as Anthonio had done,"
7187,SONG,for all the words he could hear Olivia speak were words of kindness
7188,SONG,to Cesario: and when he found his page had obtained this high place
7189,SONG,"in Olivia's favour, he threatened him with all the terrors of his just"
7190,SONG,"revenge; and as he was going to depart, he called Viola to follow"
7191,SONG,"him, saying, ""Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe for mischief."""
7192,SONG,Though it seemed in his jealous rage he was going to doom Viola to
7193,SONG,"instant death, yet her love made her no longer a coward, and she said"
7194,SONG,she would most joyfully suffer death to give her master ease. But
7195,SONG,"Olivia would not so lose her husband, and she cried, ""Where goes my"
7196,SONG,"Cesario?"" Viola replied, ""After him I love more than my life."" Olivia"
7197,SONG,however prevented their departure by loudly proclaiming that Cesario
7198,SONG,"was her husband, and sent for the priest, who declared that not two"
7199,SONG,hours had passed since he had married the lady Olivia to this young
7200,SONG,man. In vain Viola protested she was not married to Olivia; the
7201,SONG,evidence of that lady and the priest made Orsino believe that his page
7202,SONG,had robbed him of the treasure he prized above his life. But thinking
7203,SONG,"that it was past recall, he was bidding farewel to his faithless"
7204,SONG,"mistress, and the _young dissembler_, her husband, as he called Viola,"
7205,SONG,"warning her never to come in his sight again, when (as it seemed to"
7206,SONG,"them) a miracle appeared! for another Cesario entered, and addressed"
7207,SONG,"Olivia as his wife. This new Cesario was Sebastian, the real husband"
7208,SONG,of Olivia; and when their wonder had a little ceased at seeing two
7209,SONG,"persons with the same face, the same voice, and the same habit, the"
7210,SONG,brother and sister began to question each other; for Viola could
7211,SONG,"scarce be persuaded that her brother was living, and Sebastian knew"
7212,SONG,not how to account for the sister he supposed drowned being found in
7213,SONG,the habit of a young man. But Viola presently acknowledged that she
7214,SONG,"was indeed Viola and his sister, under that disguise."
7215,SONG,
7216,SONG,When all the errors were cleared up which the extreme likeness between
7217,SONG,"this twin brother and sister had occasioned, they laughed at the lady"
7218,SONG,Olivia for the pleasant mistake she had made in falling in love with
7219,SONG,"a woman; and Olivia shewed no dislike to her exchange, when she found"
7220,SONG,she had wedded the brother instead of the sister.
7221,SONG,
7222,SONG,The hopes of Orsino were for ever at an end by this marriage of
7223,SONG,"Olivia, and with his hopes, all his fruitless love seemed to vanish"
7224,SONG,"away, and all his thoughts were fixed on the event of his favourite,"
7225,SONG,"young Cesario, being changed into a fair lady. He viewed Viola with"
7226,SONG,"great attention, and he remembered how very handsome he had always"
7227,SONG,"thought Cesario was, and he concluded she would look very beautiful in"
7228,SONG,a woman's attire; and then he remembered how often she had said _she
7229,SONG,"loved him_, which at the time seemed only the dutiful expression of a"
7230,SONG,"faithful page, but now he guessed that something more was meant, for"
7231,SONG,"many of her pretty sayings, which were like riddles to him, came now"
7232,SONG,"into his mind, and he no sooner remembered all these things than he"
7233,SONG,resolved to make Viola his wife; and he said to her (he still could
7234,SONG,"not help calling her _Cesario_ and _boy_), ""Boy, you have said to me a"
7235,SONG,"thousand times that you should never love a woman like to me, and for"
7236,SONG,the faithful service you have done for me so much beneath your soft
7237,SONG,"and tender breeding, and since you have called me master so long, you"
7238,SONG,"shall now be your master's mistress, and Orsino's true duchess."""
7239,SONG,
7240,SONG,"Olivia, perceiving Orsino was making over that heart, which she had"
7241,SONG,"so ungraciously rejected, to Viola, invited them to enter her house,"
7242,SONG,"and offered the assistance of the good priest, who had married her"
7243,SONG,"to Sebastian in the morning, to perform the same ceremony in the"
7244,SONG,remaining part of the day for Orsino and Viola. Thus the twin brother
7245,SONG,"and sister were both wedded on the same day: the storm and shipwreck,"
7246,SONG,"which had separated them, being the means of bringing to pass their"
7247,SONG,"high and mighty fortunes. Viola was the wife of Orsino, the duke of"
7248,SONG,"Illyria, and Sebastian the husband of the rich and noble countess, the"
7249,SONG,lady Olivia.

7255,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7256,TIMON OF ATHENS,(_By Charles Lamb_)
7257,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7258,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7259,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Timon, a lord of Athens, in the enjoyment of a princely fortune,"
7260,TIMON OF ATHENS,affected a humour of liberality which knew no limits. His almost
7261,TIMON OF ATHENS,"infinite wealth could not flow in so fast, but he poured it out faster"
7262,TIMON OF ATHENS,upon all sorts and degrees of people. Not the poor only tasted of his
7263,TIMON OF ATHENS,"bounty, but great lords did not disdain to rank themselves among"
7264,TIMON OF ATHENS,his dependants and followers. His table was resorted to by all the
7265,TIMON OF ATHENS,"luxurious feasters, and his house was open to all comers and goers at"
7266,TIMON OF ATHENS,Athens. His large wealth combined with his free and prodigal nature
7267,TIMON OF ATHENS,to subdue all hearts to his love; men of all minds and dispositions
7268,TIMON OF ATHENS,"tendered their services to lord Timon, from the glass-faced flatterer,"
7269,TIMON OF ATHENS,"whose face reflects as in a mirror the present humour of his patron,"
7270,TIMON OF ATHENS,"to the rough and unbending cynic, who affecting a contempt of men's"
7271,TIMON OF ATHENS,"persons, and an indifference to worldly things, yet could not"
7272,TIMON OF ATHENS,stand out against the gracious manners and munificent soul of lord
7273,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Timon, but would come (against his nature) to partake of his royal"
7274,TIMON OF ATHENS,"entertainments, and return most rich in his own estimation if he had"
7275,TIMON OF ATHENS,received a nod or a salutation from Timon.
7276,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7277,TIMON OF ATHENS,If a poet had composed a work which wanted a recommendatory
7278,TIMON OF ATHENS,"introduction to the world, he had no more to do but to dedicate it to"
7279,TIMON OF ATHENS,"lord Timon, and the poem was sure of sale, besides a present purse"
7280,TIMON OF ATHENS,"from the patron, and daily access to his house and table. If a painter"
7281,TIMON OF ATHENS,"had a picture to dispose of, he had only to take it to lord Timon, and"
7282,TIMON OF ATHENS,pretend to consult his taste as to the merits of it; nothing more was
7283,TIMON OF ATHENS,wanting to persuade the liberal-hearted lord to buy it. If a jeweller
7284,TIMON OF ATHENS,"had a stone of price, or a mercer rich costly stuffs, which for their"
7285,TIMON OF ATHENS,"costliness lay upon his hands, lord Timon's house was a ready mart"
7286,TIMON OF ATHENS,"always open, where they might get off their wares or their jewellery"
7287,TIMON OF ATHENS,"at any price, and the good natured lord would thank them into the"
7288,TIMON OF ATHENS,"bargain, as if they had done him a piece of courtesy in letting him"
7289,TIMON OF ATHENS,have the refusal of such precious commodities. So that by this means
7290,TIMON OF ATHENS,"his house was thronged with superfluous purchases, of no use but to"
7291,TIMON OF ATHENS,swell uneasy and ostentatious pomp; and his person was still more
7292,TIMON OF ATHENS,"inconveniently beset with a crowd of these idle visitors, lying poets,"
7293,TIMON OF ATHENS,"painters, sharking tradesmen, lords, ladies, needy courtiers, and"
7294,TIMON OF ATHENS,"expectants, who continually filled his lobbies, raining their fulsome"
7295,TIMON OF ATHENS,"flatteries in whispers in his ears, sacrificing to him with adulation"
7296,TIMON OF ATHENS,"as to a God, making sacred the very stirrup by which he mounted his"
7297,TIMON OF ATHENS,"horse, and seeming as though they drank the free air but through his"
7298,TIMON OF ATHENS,permission and bounty.
7299,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7300,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Some of these daily dependents were young men of birth, who (their"
7301,TIMON OF ATHENS,means not answering to their extravagance) had been put in prison by
7302,TIMON OF ATHENS,"creditors, and redeemed thence by lord Timon; these young prodigals"
7303,TIMON OF ATHENS,"thenceforward fastened upon his lordship, as if by common sympathy he"
7304,TIMON OF ATHENS,"were necessarily endeared to all such spendthrifts and loose livers,"
7305,TIMON OF ATHENS,"who not being able to follow him in his wealth, found it easier to"
7306,TIMON OF ATHENS,copy him in prodigality and copious spending of what was not their
7307,TIMON OF ATHENS,"own. One of these flesh-flies was Ventidius, for whose debts unjustly"
7308,TIMON OF ATHENS,contracted Timon but lately had paid down the sum of five talents.
7309,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7310,TIMON OF ATHENS,"But among this confluence, this great flood of visitors, none were"
7311,TIMON OF ATHENS,more conspicuous than the makers of presents and givers of gifts. It
7312,TIMON OF ATHENS,"was fortunate for these men, if Timon took a fancy to a dog, or a"
7313,TIMON OF ATHENS,"horse, or any piece of cheap furniture which was theirs. The thing"
7314,TIMON OF ATHENS,"so praised, whatever it was, was sure to be sent the next morning"
7315,TIMON OF ATHENS,"with the compliments of the giver for lord Timon's acceptance, and"
7316,TIMON OF ATHENS,"apologies for the unworthiness of the gift; and this dog or horse, or"
7317,TIMON OF ATHENS,"whatever it might be, did not fail to produce, from Timon's bounty,"
7318,TIMON OF ATHENS,"who would not be outdone in gifts, perhaps twenty dogs or horses,"
7319,TIMON OF ATHENS,"certainly presents of far richer worth, as these pretended donors knew"
7320,TIMON OF ATHENS,"well enough, and that their false presents were but the putting out of"
7321,TIMON OF ATHENS,so much money at large and speedy interest. In this way lord Lucius
7322,TIMON OF ATHENS,had lately sent to Timon a present of four milk-white horses trapped
7323,TIMON OF ATHENS,"in silver, which this cunning lord had observed Timon upon some"
7324,TIMON OF ATHENS,"occasion to commend; and another lord, Lucullus, had bestowed upon him"
7325,TIMON OF ATHENS,"in the same pretended way of free gift a brace of greyhounds, whose"
7326,TIMON OF ATHENS,make and fleetness Timon had been heard to admire; these presents the
7327,TIMON OF ATHENS,easy-hearted lord accepted without suspicion of the dishonest views of
7328,TIMON OF ATHENS,the presenters: and the givers of course were rewarded with some rich
7329,TIMON OF ATHENS,"return, a diamond or some jewel of twenty times the value of their"
7330,TIMON OF ATHENS,false and mercenary donation.
7331,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7332,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Sometimes these creatures would go to work in a more direct way, and"
7333,TIMON OF ATHENS,"with gross and palpable artifice, which yet the credulous Timon was"
7334,TIMON OF ATHENS,"too blind to see, would affect to admire and praise something that"
7335,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Timon possessed, a bargain that he had bought, or some late purchase,"
7336,TIMON OF ATHENS,which was sure to draw from this yielding and soft-hearted lord a gift
7337,TIMON OF ATHENS,"of the thing commended, for no service in the world done for it but"
7338,TIMON OF ATHENS,the easy expence of a little cheap and obvious flattery. In this way
7339,TIMON OF ATHENS,Timon but the other day had given to one of these mean lords the bay
7340,TIMON OF ATHENS,"courser which he himself rode upon, because his lordship had been"
7341,TIMON OF ATHENS,pleased to say that it was a handsome beast and went well; and Timon
7342,TIMON OF ATHENS,knew that no man ever justly praised what he did not wish to possess.
7343,TIMON OF ATHENS,"For lord Timon weighed his friends' affection with his own, and so"
7344,TIMON OF ATHENS,"fond was he of bestowing, that he could have dealt kingdoms to these"
7345,TIMON OF ATHENS,"supposed friends, and never have been weary."
7346,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7347,TIMON OF ATHENS,Not that Timon's wealth all went to enrich these wicked flatterers;
7348,TIMON OF ATHENS,he could do noble and praise-worthy actions; and when a servant of
7349,TIMON OF ATHENS,"his once loved the daughter of a rich Athenian, but could not hope"
7350,TIMON OF ATHENS,to obtain her by reason that in wealth and rank the maid was so far
7351,TIMON OF ATHENS,"above him, lord Timon freely bestowed upon his servant three Athenian"
7352,TIMON OF ATHENS,"talents, to make his fortune equal with the dowry which the father of"
7353,TIMON OF ATHENS,the young maid demanded of him who should be her husband. But for the
7354,TIMON OF ATHENS,"most part, knaves and parasites had the command of his fortune, false"
7355,TIMON OF ATHENS,"friends whom he did not know to be such, but, because they flocked"
7356,TIMON OF ATHENS,"around his person, he thought they must needs love him; and because"
7357,TIMON OF ATHENS,"they smiled, and flattered him, he thought surely that his conduct was"
7358,TIMON OF ATHENS,approved by all the wise and good. And when he was feasting in the
7359,TIMON OF ATHENS,"midst of all these flatterers and mock friends, when they were eating"
7360,TIMON OF ATHENS,"him up, and draining his fortunes dry with large draughts of richest"
7361,TIMON OF ATHENS,"wines drunk to his health and prosperity, he could not perceive the"
7362,TIMON OF ATHENS,"difference of a friend from a flatterer, but to his deluded eyes (made"
7363,TIMON OF ATHENS,"proud with the sight) it seemed a precious comfort to have so many,"
7364,TIMON OF ATHENS,like brothers commanding one another's fortunes (though it was his own
7365,TIMON OF ATHENS,"fortune which paid all the cost), and with joy they would run over"
7366,TIMON OF ATHENS,"at the spectacle of such, as it appeared to him, truly festive and"
7367,TIMON OF ATHENS,fraternal meeting.
7368,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7369,TIMON OF ATHENS,"But while he thus outwent the very heart of kindness, and poured out"
7370,TIMON OF ATHENS,"his bounty, as if Plutus, the god of gold, had been but his steward;"
7371,TIMON OF ATHENS,"while thus he proceeded without care or stop, so senseless of expence"
7372,TIMON OF ATHENS,"that he would neither enquire how he could maintain it, nor cease his"
7373,TIMON OF ATHENS,"wild flow of riot; his riches, which were not infinite, must needs"
7374,TIMON OF ATHENS,melt away before a prodigality which knew no limits. But who should
7375,TIMON OF ATHENS,tell him so? his flatterers? they had an interest in shutting his
7376,TIMON OF ATHENS,eyes. In vain did his honest steward Flavius try to represent to him
7377,TIMON OF ATHENS,"his condition, laying his accounts before him, begging of him, praying"
7378,TIMON OF ATHENS,"of him, with an importunity that on any other occasion would have been"
7379,TIMON OF ATHENS,"unmannerly in a servant, beseeching him with tears, to look into the"
7380,TIMON OF ATHENS,"state of his affairs. Timon would still put him off, and turn the"
7381,TIMON OF ATHENS,discourse to something else; for nothing is so deaf to remonstrance
7382,TIMON OF ATHENS,"as riches turned to poverty, nothing is so unwilling to believe its"
7383,TIMON OF ATHENS,"situation, nothing so incredulous to its own true state, and hard to"
7384,TIMON OF ATHENS,"give credit to a reverse. Often had this good steward, this honest"
7385,TIMON OF ATHENS,"creature, when all the rooms of Timon's great house have been choked"
7386,TIMON OF ATHENS,"up with riotous feeders at his master's cost, when the floors have"
7387,TIMON OF ATHENS,"wept with drunken spilling of wine, and every apartment has blazed"
7388,TIMON OF ATHENS,"with lights and resounded with music and feasting, often had he"
7389,TIMON OF ATHENS,"retired by himself to some solitary spot, and wept faster than the"
7390,TIMON OF ATHENS,"wine ran from the wasteful casks within, to see the mad bounty of his"
7391,TIMON OF ATHENS,"lord, and to think, when the means were gone which bought him praises"
7392,TIMON OF ATHENS,"from all sorts of people, how quickly the breath would be gone of"
7393,TIMON OF ATHENS,which the praise was made; praises won in feasting would be lost
7394,TIMON OF ATHENS,"in fasting, and at one cloud of winter-showers these flies would"
7395,TIMON OF ATHENS,disappear.
7396,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7397,TIMON OF ATHENS,But now the time was come that Timon could shut his ears no longer to
7398,TIMON OF ATHENS,the representations of this faithful steward. Money must be had; and
7399,TIMON OF ATHENS,"when he ordered Flavius to sell some of his land for that purpose,"
7400,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Flavius informed him, what he had in vain endeavoured at several times"
7401,TIMON OF ATHENS,"before to make him listen to, that most of his land was already sold"
7402,TIMON OF ATHENS,"or forfeited, and that all he possessed at present was not enough"
7403,TIMON OF ATHENS,to pay the one half of what he owed. Struck with wonder at this
7404,TIMON OF ATHENS,"presentation, Timon hastily replied, ""My lands extended from Athens to"
7405,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Lacedemon."" ""O my good lord,"" said Flavius, ""the world is but a world,"
7406,TIMON OF ATHENS,"and has bounds; were it all yours to give in a breath, how quickly"
7407,TIMON OF ATHENS,"were it gone!"" Timon consoled himself that no villainous bounty had"
7408,TIMON OF ATHENS,"yet come from him, that if he had given his wealth away unwisely it"
7409,TIMON OF ATHENS,"had not been bestowed to feed his vices, but to cherish his friends;"
7410,TIMON OF ATHENS,and he bade the kind-hearted steward (who was weeping) to take comfort
7411,TIMON OF ATHENS,"in the assurance that his master could never lack means, while he had"
7412,TIMON OF ATHENS,so many noble friends; and this infatuated lord persuaded himself
7413,TIMON OF ATHENS,"that he had nothing to do but to send and borrow, to use every man's"
7414,TIMON OF ATHENS,"fortune (that had ever tasted his bounty) in this extremity, as freely"
7415,TIMON OF ATHENS,"as his own. Then with a cheerful look, as if confident of the trial,"
7416,TIMON OF ATHENS,"he severally dispatched messengers to lord Lucius, to lords Lucullus"
7417,TIMON OF ATHENS,"and Sempronius, men upon whom he had lavished his gifts in past times"
7418,TIMON OF ATHENS,"without measure or moderation; and to Ventidius, whom he had lately"
7419,TIMON OF ATHENS,"released out of prison by paying his debts, and who by the death of"
7420,TIMON OF ATHENS,"his father was now come into the possession of an ample fortune, and"
7421,TIMON OF ATHENS,well enabled to requite Timon's courtesy; to request of Ventidius the
7422,TIMON OF ATHENS,"return of those five talents which he had paid for him, and of each"
7423,TIMON OF ATHENS,of those noble lords the loan of fifty talents: nothing doubting that
7424,TIMON OF ATHENS,their gratitude would supply his wants (if he needed it) to the amount
7425,TIMON OF ATHENS,of five hundred times fifty talents.
7426,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7427,TIMON OF ATHENS,Lucullus was the first applied to. This mean lord had been dreaming
7428,TIMON OF ATHENS,"over-night of a silver bason and cup, and when Timon's servant was"
7429,TIMON OF ATHENS,"announced, his sordid mind suggested to him that this was surely a"
7430,TIMON OF ATHENS,"making out of his dream, and that Timon had sent him such a present:"
7431,TIMON OF ATHENS,"but when he understood the truth of the matter, and that Timon wanted"
7432,TIMON OF ATHENS,"money, the quality of his faint and watery friendship shewed itself,"
7433,TIMON OF ATHENS,for with many protestations he vowed to the servant that he had long
7434,TIMON OF ATHENS,"foreseen the ruin of his master's affairs, and many a time had he come"
7435,TIMON OF ATHENS,"to dinner, to tell him of it, and had come again to supper, to try to"
7436,TIMON OF ATHENS,"persuade him to spend less, but he would take no counsel nor warning"
7437,TIMON OF ATHENS,by his coming: and true it was that he had been a constant attender
7438,TIMON OF ATHENS,"(as he said) at Timon's feasts, as he had in greater things tasted his"
7439,TIMON OF ATHENS,"bounty, but that he ever came with that intent, or gave good counsel"
7440,TIMON OF ATHENS,"or reproof to Timon, was a base unworthy lie, which he suitably"
7441,TIMON OF ATHENS,"followed up with meanly offering the servant a bribe, to go home to"
7442,TIMON OF ATHENS,his master and tell him that he had not found Lucullus at home.
7443,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7444,TIMON OF ATHENS,As little success had the messenger who was sent to lord Lucius. This
7445,TIMON OF ATHENS,"lying lord, who was full of Timon's meat, and enriched almost to"
7446,TIMON OF ATHENS,"bursting with Timon's costly presents, when he found the wind changed,"
7447,TIMON OF ATHENS,"and the fountain of so much bounty suddenly stopt, at first could"
7448,TIMON OF ATHENS,"hardly believe it; but on its being confirmed, he affected great"
7449,TIMON OF ATHENS,"regret that he should not have it in his power to serve lord Timon,"
7450,TIMON OF ATHENS,for unfortunately (which was a base falsehood) he had made a great
7451,TIMON OF ATHENS,"purchase the day before, which had quite disfurnished him of the means"
7452,TIMON OF ATHENS,"at present; the more beast he, he called himself, to put it out of his"
7453,TIMON OF ATHENS,power to serve so good a friend; and he counted it one of his greatest
7454,TIMON OF ATHENS,afflictions that his ability should fail him to pleasure such an
7455,TIMON OF ATHENS,honourable gentleman.
7456,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7457,TIMON OF ATHENS,Who can call any man friend that dips in the same dish with him? just
7458,TIMON OF ATHENS,of this metal is every flatterer. In the recollection of every body
7459,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Timon had been a father to this Lucius, had kept up his credit with"
7460,TIMON OF ATHENS,"his purse; Timon's money had gone to pay the wages of his servants, to"
7461,TIMON OF ATHENS,pay the hire of the labourers who had sweat to build the fine houses
7462,TIMON OF ATHENS,"which Lucius's pride had made necessary to him: yet, oh! the monster"
7463,TIMON OF ATHENS,which man makes himself when he proves ungrateful! this Lucius now
7464,TIMON OF ATHENS,"denied to Timon a sum, which, in respect of what Timon had bestowed on"
7465,TIMON OF ATHENS,"him, was less than charitable men afford to beggars."
7466,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7467,TIMON OF ATHENS,Sempronius and every one of these mercenary lords to whom Timon
7468,TIMON OF ATHENS,"applied in their turn, returned the same evasive answer or direct"
7469,TIMON OF ATHENS,"denial; even Ventidius, the redeemed and now rich Ventidius, refused"
7470,TIMON OF ATHENS,to assist him with those five talents which Timon had not lent but
7471,TIMON OF ATHENS,generously given him in his distress.
7472,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7473,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Now was Timon as much avoided in his poverty, as he had been courted"
7474,TIMON OF ATHENS,and resorted to in his riches. Now the same tongues which had been
7475,TIMON OF ATHENS,"loudest in his praises, extolling him as bountiful, liberal, and"
7476,TIMON OF ATHENS,"open-handed, were not ashamed to censure that very bounty as folly,"
7477,TIMON OF ATHENS,"that liberality as profuseness, though it had shewn itself folly in"
7478,TIMON OF ATHENS,nothing so truly as in the selection of such unworthy creatures as
7479,TIMON OF ATHENS,"themselves for its objects. Now was Timon's princely mansion forsaken,"
7480,TIMON OF ATHENS,"and become a shunned and hated place, a place for men to pass by,"
7481,TIMON OF ATHENS,not a place as formerly where every passenger must stop and taste of
7482,TIMON OF ATHENS,his wine and good cheer; now instead of being thronged with feasting
7483,TIMON OF ATHENS,"and tumultuous guests, it was beset with impatient and clamorous"
7484,TIMON OF ATHENS,"creditors, usurers, extortioners, fierce and intolerable in their"
7485,TIMON OF ATHENS,"demands, pleading bonds, interest, mortgages, iron-hearted men that"
7486,TIMON OF ATHENS,"would take no denial nor putting off, that Timon's house was now"
7487,TIMON OF ATHENS,"his jail, where he could not pass, nor go in nor out for them; one"
7488,TIMON OF ATHENS,"demanding his due of fifty talents, another bringing in a bill of five"
7489,TIMON OF ATHENS,"thousand crowns, which if he would tell out his blood by drops, and"
7490,TIMON OF ATHENS,"pay them so, he had not enough in his body to discharge, drop by drop."
7491,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7492,TIMON OF ATHENS,In this desperate and irremediable state (as it seemed) of his
7493,TIMON OF ATHENS,"affairs, the eyes of all men were suddenly surprised at a new and"
7494,TIMON OF ATHENS,incredible lustre which this setting sun put forth. Once more lord
7495,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Timon proclaimed a feast, to which he invited his accustomed guests,"
7496,TIMON OF ATHENS,"lords, ladies, all that was great or fashionable in Athens. Lords"
7497,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Lucius and Lucullus came, Ventidius, Sempronius, and the rest. Who"
7498,TIMON OF ATHENS,"more sorry now than these fawning wretches, when they found (as they"
7499,TIMON OF ATHENS,"thought) that lord Timon's poverty was all pretence, and had been"
7500,TIMON OF ATHENS,"only put on to make trial of their loves, to think that they should"
7501,TIMON OF ATHENS,"not have seen through the artifice at the time, and have had the"
7502,TIMON OF ATHENS,cheap credit of obliging his lordship? yet who more glad to find the
7503,TIMON OF ATHENS,"fountain of that noble bounty, which they had thought dried up, still"
7504,TIMON OF ATHENS,"fresh and running? They came dissembling, protesting, expressing"
7505,TIMON OF ATHENS,"deepest sorrow and shame, that when his lordship sent to them, they"
7506,TIMON OF ATHENS,should have been so unfortunate as to want the present means to oblige
7507,TIMON OF ATHENS,so honourable a friend. But Timon begged them not to give such trifles
7508,TIMON OF ATHENS,"a thought, for he had altogether forgotten it. And these base fawning"
7509,TIMON OF ATHENS,"lords, though they had denied him money in his adversity, yet"
7510,TIMON OF ATHENS,could not refuse their presence at this new blaze of his returning
7511,TIMON OF ATHENS,prosperity. For the swallow follows not summer more willingly than men
7512,TIMON OF ATHENS,"of these dispositions follow the good fortunes of the great, nor more"
7513,TIMON OF ATHENS,willingly leaves winter than these shrink from the first appearance
7514,TIMON OF ATHENS,of a reverse; such summer-birds are men. But now with music and state
7515,TIMON OF ATHENS,the banquet of smoking dishes was served up; and when the guests had
7516,TIMON OF ATHENS,a little done admiring whence the bankrupt Timon could find means to
7517,TIMON OF ATHENS,"furnish so costly a feast, some doubting whether the scene which they"
7518,TIMON OF ATHENS,"saw was real, as scarce trusting their own eyes; at a signal given,"
7519,TIMON OF ATHENS,"the dishes were uncovered, and Timon's drift appeared: instead of"
7520,TIMON OF ATHENS,"those varieties and far-fetched dainties which they expected, that"
7521,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Timon's epicurean table in past times had so liberally presented, now"
7522,TIMON OF ATHENS,appeared under the covers of these dishes a preparation more suitable
7523,TIMON OF ATHENS,"to Timon's poverty, nothing but a little smoke and luke-warm water,"
7524,TIMON OF ATHENS,"fit feast for this knot of mouth-friends, whose professions were"
7525,TIMON OF ATHENS,"indeed smoke, and their hearts luke-warm and slippery as the water,"
7526,TIMON OF ATHENS,"with which Timon welcomed his astonished guests, bidding them,"
7527,TIMON OF ATHENS,"""Uncover, dogs, and lap;"" and before they could recover their"
7528,TIMON OF ATHENS,"surprise, sprinkling it in their faces, that they might have enough,"
7529,TIMON OF ATHENS,"and throwing dishes and all after them, who now ran huddling out,"
7530,TIMON OF ATHENS,"lords, ladies, with their caps snatched up in haste, a splendid"
7531,TIMON OF ATHENS,"confusion, Timon pursuing them, still calling them what they were,"
7532,TIMON OF ATHENS,"""Smooth, smiling parasites, destroyers under the mask of courtesy,"
7533,TIMON OF ATHENS,"affable wolves, meek bears, fools of fortune, feast-friends,"
7534,TIMON OF ATHENS,"time-flies."" They, crowding out to avoid him, left the house more"
7535,TIMON OF ATHENS,"willingly than they had entered it; some losing their gowns and caps,"
7536,TIMON OF ATHENS,"and some their jewels in the hurry, all glad to escape out of the"
7537,TIMON OF ATHENS,"presence of such a mad lord, and the ridicule of his mock banquet."
7538,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7539,TIMON OF ATHENS,"This was the last feast which ever Timon made, and in it he took"
7540,TIMON OF ATHENS,"farewell of Athens and the society of men; for, after that, he betook"
7541,TIMON OF ATHENS,"himself to the woods, turning his back upon the hated city and upon"
7542,TIMON OF ATHENS,"all mankind, wishing the walls of that detestable city might sink, and"
7543,TIMON OF ATHENS,"the houses fall upon their owners, wishing all plagues which infest"
7544,TIMON OF ATHENS,"humanity, war, outrage, poverty, diseases, might fasten upon its"
7545,TIMON OF ATHENS,"inhabitants, praying the just gods to confound all Athenians, both"
7546,TIMON OF ATHENS,"young and old, high and low; so wishing, he went to the woods, where"
7547,TIMON OF ATHENS,he said he should find the unkindest beast much kinder than those of
7548,TIMON OF ATHENS,"his own species. He stripped himself naked, that he might retain no"
7549,TIMON OF ATHENS,"fashion of a man, and dug a cave to live in, and lived solitary in the"
7550,TIMON OF ATHENS,"manner of a beast, eating the wild roots, and drinking water, flying"
7551,TIMON OF ATHENS,"from the face of his kind, and choosing rather to herd with wild"
7552,TIMON OF ATHENS,"beasts, as more harmless and friendly than man."
7553,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7554,TIMON OF ATHENS,"What a change from lord Timon the rich, lord Timon the delight of"
7555,TIMON OF ATHENS,"mankind, to Timon the naked, Timon the manhater! Where were his"
7556,TIMON OF ATHENS,flatterers now? Where were his attendants and retinue? Would the bleak
7557,TIMON OF ATHENS,"air, that boisterous servitor, be his chamberlain, to put his shirt on"
7558,TIMON OF ATHENS,"warm? Would those stiff trees, that had outlived the eagle, turn young"
7559,TIMON OF ATHENS,"and airy pages to him, to skip on his errands when he bade them? Would"
7560,TIMON OF ATHENS,"the cool brook, when it was iced with winter, administer to him his"
7561,TIMON OF ATHENS,warm broths and caudles when sick of an over-night's surfeit? Or would
7562,TIMON OF ATHENS,"the creatures that lived in those wild woods, come and lick his hand,"
7563,TIMON OF ATHENS,and flatter him?
7564,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7565,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Here on a day, when he was digging for roots, his poor sustenance, his"
7566,TIMON OF ATHENS,"spade struck against something heavy, which proved to be gold, a great"
7567,TIMON OF ATHENS,"heap which some miser had probably buried in a time of alarm, thinking"
7568,TIMON OF ATHENS,"to have come again and taken it from its prison, but died before"
7569,TIMON OF ATHENS,"the opportunity had arrived, without making any man privy to the"
7570,TIMON OF ATHENS,"concealment; so it lay, doing neither good nor harm, in the bowels of"
7571,TIMON OF ATHENS,"the earth, its mother, as if it had never come from thence, till the"
7572,TIMON OF ATHENS,accidental striking of Timon's spade against it once more brought it
7573,TIMON OF ATHENS,to light.
7574,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7575,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Here was a mass of treasure which if Timon had retained his old mind,"
7576,TIMON OF ATHENS,was enough to have purchased him friends and flatterers again; but
7577,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Timon was sick of the false world, and the sight of gold was poisonous"
7578,TIMON OF ATHENS,"to his eyes; and he would have restored it to the earth, but that,"
7579,TIMON OF ATHENS,thinking of the infinite calamities which by means of gold happen to
7580,TIMON OF ATHENS,"mankind, how the lucre of it causes robberies, oppression, injustice,"
7581,TIMON OF ATHENS,"briberies, violence and murder, among men, he had a pleasure in"
7582,TIMON OF ATHENS,imagining (such a rooted hatred did he bear to his species) that out
7583,TIMON OF ATHENS,"of this heap which in digging he had discovered, might arise some"
7584,TIMON OF ATHENS,mischief to plague mankind. And some soldiers passing through the
7585,TIMON OF ATHENS,"woods near to his cave at that instant, which proved to be a part of"
7586,TIMON OF ATHENS,"the troops of the Athenian captain Alcibiades, who upon some disgust"
7587,TIMON OF ATHENS,taken against the senators of Athens (the Athenians were ever noted to
7588,TIMON OF ATHENS,"be a thankless and ungrateful people, giving disgust to their generals"
7589,TIMON OF ATHENS,"and best friends), was marching at the head of the same triumphant"
7590,TIMON OF ATHENS,"army which he had formerly headed in their defence, to war against"
7591,TIMON OF ATHENS,"them; Timon, who liked their business well, bestowed upon their"
7592,TIMON OF ATHENS,"captain the gold to pay his soldiers, requiring no other service from"
7593,TIMON OF ATHENS,"him, than that he should with his conquering army lay Athens level"
7594,TIMON OF ATHENS,"with the ground, and burn, slay, kill all her inhabitants; not sparing"
7595,TIMON OF ATHENS,"the old men for their white beards, for (he said) they were usurers,"
7596,TIMON OF ATHENS,"nor the young children for their seeming innocent smiles, for those"
7597,TIMON OF ATHENS,"(he said) would live, if they grew up, to be traitors; but to steel"
7598,TIMON OF ATHENS,his eyes and ears against any sights or sounds that might awaken
7599,TIMON OF ATHENS,"compassion; and not to let the cries of virgins, babes, or mothers,"
7600,TIMON OF ATHENS,"hinder him from making one universal massacre of the city, but to"
7601,TIMON OF ATHENS,"confound them all in his conquest; and when he had conquered, he"
7602,TIMON OF ATHENS,"prayed that the gods would confound him also, the conqueror: so"
7603,TIMON OF ATHENS,"thoroughly did Timon hate Athens, Athenians, and all mankind."
7604,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7605,TIMON OF ATHENS,"While he lived in this forlorn state, leading a life more brutal than"
7606,TIMON OF ATHENS,"human, he was suddenly surprised one day with the appearance of a"
7607,TIMON OF ATHENS,man standing in an admiring posture at the door of his cave. It was
7608,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Flavius, the honest steward, whom love and zealous affection to his"
7609,TIMON OF ATHENS,"master had led to seek him out at his wretched dwelling, and to offer"
7610,TIMON OF ATHENS,"his services! and the first sight of his master, the once noble Timon,"
7611,TIMON OF ATHENS,"in that abject condition, naked as he was born, living in the manner"
7612,TIMON OF ATHENS,"of a beast among beasts, looking like his own sad ruins and a monument"
7613,TIMON OF ATHENS,"of decay, so affected this good servant, that he stood speechless,"
7614,TIMON OF ATHENS,"wrapt up in horror, and confounded. And when he found utterance at"
7615,TIMON OF ATHENS,"last to his words, they were so choaked with tears, that Timon had"
7616,TIMON OF ATHENS,"much ado to know him again, or to make out who it was that had come"
7617,TIMON OF ATHENS,(so contrary to the experience he had had of mankind) to offer him
7618,TIMON OF ATHENS,"service in extremity. And being in the form and shape of a man, he"
7619,TIMON OF ATHENS,"suspected him for a traitor, and his tears for false; but the good"
7620,TIMON OF ATHENS,"servant by so many tokens confirmed the truth of his fidelity, and"
7621,TIMON OF ATHENS,made it clear that nothing but love and zealous duty to his once dear
7622,TIMON OF ATHENS,"master had brought him there, that Timon was forced to confess that"
7623,TIMON OF ATHENS,"the world contained one honest man; yet, being in the shape and form"
7624,TIMON OF ATHENS,"of a man, he could not look upon his man's face without abhorrence,"
7625,TIMON OF ATHENS,or hear words uttered from his man's lips without loathing; and this
7626,TIMON OF ATHENS,"singly honest man was forced to depart, because he was a man, and"
7627,TIMON OF ATHENS,"because, with a heart more gentle and compassionate than is usual to"
7628,TIMON OF ATHENS,"man, he bore man's detested form and outward feature."
7629,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7630,TIMON OF ATHENS,But greater visitants than a poor steward were about to interrupt the
7631,TIMON OF ATHENS,savage quiet of Timon's solitude. For now the day was come when the
7632,TIMON OF ATHENS,ungrateful lords of Athens sorely repented the injustice which they
7633,TIMON OF ATHENS,"had done to the noble Timon. For Alcibiades, like an incensed wild"
7634,TIMON OF ATHENS,"boar, was raging at the walls of their city, and with his hot siege"
7635,TIMON OF ATHENS,threatened to lay fair Athens in the dust. And now the memory of lord
7636,TIMON OF ATHENS,Timon's former prowess and military conduct came fresh into their
7637,TIMON OF ATHENS,"forgetful minds, for Timon had been their general in past times, and"
7638,TIMON OF ATHENS,"was a valiant and expert soldier, who alone of all the Athenians was"
7639,TIMON OF ATHENS,"deemed able to cope with a besieging army, such as then threatened"
7640,TIMON OF ATHENS,"them, or to drive back the furious approaches of Alcibiades."
7641,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7642,TIMON OF ATHENS,A deputation of the senators was chosen in this emergency to wait upon
7643,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Timon. To him they come in their extremity, to whom, when he was in"
7644,TIMON OF ATHENS,"extremity, they had shewn but small regard; as if they presumed upon"
7645,TIMON OF ATHENS,"his gratitude whom they had disobliged, and had derived a claim to his"
7646,TIMON OF ATHENS,courtesy from their own most discourteous and unpiteous treatment.
7647,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7648,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Now they earnestly beseech him, implore him with tears, to return and"
7649,TIMON OF ATHENS,"save that city, from which their ingratitude had so lately driven"
7650,TIMON OF ATHENS,"him; now they offer him riches, power, dignities, satisfaction for"
7651,TIMON OF ATHENS,"past injuries, and public honours and the public love; their persons,"
7652,TIMON OF ATHENS,"lives, and fortunes, to be at his disposal, if he will but come back"
7653,TIMON OF ATHENS,"and save them. But Timon the naked, Timon the man-hater, was no longer"
7654,TIMON OF ATHENS,"lord Timon, the lord of bounty, the flower of valour, their defence"
7655,TIMON OF ATHENS,"in war, their ornament in peace. If Alcibiades killed his countrymen,"
7656,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Timon cared not. If he sacked fair Athens, and slew her old men and"
7657,TIMON OF ATHENS,"her infants, Timon would rejoice. So he told them; and that there"
7658,TIMON OF ATHENS,was not a knife in the unruly camp which he did not prize above the
7659,TIMON OF ATHENS,reverendest throat in Athens.
7660,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7661,TIMON OF ATHENS,This was all the answer he vouchsafed to the weeping disappointed
7662,TIMON OF ATHENS,"senators; only at parting, he bade them commend him to his countrymen,"
7663,TIMON OF ATHENS,"and tell them, that to ease them of their griefs and anxieties, and to"
7664,TIMON OF ATHENS,"prevent the consequences of fierce Alcibiades' wrath, there was yet a"
7665,TIMON OF ATHENS,"way left, which he would teach them, for he had yet so much affection"
7666,TIMON OF ATHENS,left for his dear countrymen as to be willing to do them a kindness
7667,TIMON OF ATHENS,"before his death. These words a little revived the senators, who hoped"
7668,TIMON OF ATHENS,that his kindness for their city was returning. Then Timon told them
7669,TIMON OF ATHENS,"that he had a tree, which grew near his cave, which he should shortly"
7670,TIMON OF ATHENS,"have occasion to cut down, and he invited all his friends in Athens,"
7671,TIMON OF ATHENS,"high or low, of what degree soever, who wished to shun affliction, to"
7672,TIMON OF ATHENS,"come and take a taste of his tree before he cut it down; meaning, that"
7673,TIMON OF ATHENS,"they might come and hang themselves on it, and escape affliction that"
7674,TIMON OF ATHENS,way.
7675,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7676,TIMON OF ATHENS,"And this was the last courtesy, of all his noble bounties, which Timon"
7677,TIMON OF ATHENS,"shewed to mankind, and this the last sight of him which his countrymen"
7678,TIMON OF ATHENS,"had: for not many days after, a poor soldier, passing by the"
7679,TIMON OF ATHENS,"sea-beach, which was at a little distance from the woods which Timon"
7680,TIMON OF ATHENS,"frequented, found a tomb on the verge of the sea, with an inscription"
7681,TIMON OF ATHENS,"upon it, purporting that it was the grave of Timon the man-hater, who"
7682,TIMON OF ATHENS,"""While he lived, did hate all living men, and dying, wished a plague"
7683,TIMON OF ATHENS,"might consume all caitiffs left!"""
7684,TIMON OF ATHENS,
7685,TIMON OF ATHENS,"Whether he finished his life by violence, or whether mere distaste"
7686,TIMON OF ATHENS,of life and the loathing he had for mankind brought Timon to his
7687,TIMON OF ATHENS,"conclusion, was not clear, yet all men admired the fitness of his"
7688,TIMON OF ATHENS,"epitaph, and the consistency of his end; dying, as he had lived, a"
7689,TIMON OF ATHENS,hater of mankind: and some there were who fancied a conceit in the
7690,TIMON OF ATHENS,very choice which he had made of the sea-beach for his place of
7691,TIMON OF ATHENS,"burial, where the vast sea might weep for ever upon his grave, as"
7692,TIMON OF ATHENS,in contempt of the transient and shallow tears of hypocritical and
7693,TIMON OF ATHENS,deceitful mankind.

7700,ROMEO AND JULIET,(_By Charles Lamb_)
7701,ROMEO AND JULIET,
7702,ROMEO AND JULIET,The two chief families in Verona were the rich Capulets and the
7703,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Mountagues. There had been an old quarrel between these families,"
7704,ROMEO AND JULIET,"which was grown to such a height, and so deadly was the enmity between"
7705,ROMEO AND JULIET,"them, that it extended to the remotest kindred, to the followers and"
7706,ROMEO AND JULIET,"retainers of both sides, insomuch that a servant of the house of"
7707,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Mountague could not meet a servant of the house of Capulet, nor a"
7708,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Capulet encounter with a Mountague by chance, but fierce words and"
7709,ROMEO AND JULIET,sometimes bloodshed ensued; and frequent were the brawls from such
7710,ROMEO AND JULIET,"accidental meetings, which disturbed the happy quiet of Verona's"
7711,ROMEO AND JULIET,streets.
7712,ROMEO AND JULIET,
7713,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Old lord Capulet made a great supper, to which many fair ladies and"
7714,ROMEO AND JULIET,many noble guests were invited. All the admired beauties of Verona
7715,ROMEO AND JULIET,"were present, and all comers were made welcome if they were not of the"
7716,ROMEO AND JULIET,"house of Mountague. At this feast of Capulets, Rosaline, beloved of"
7717,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Romeo, son to the old lord Mountague, was present; and though it was"
7718,ROMEO AND JULIET,"dangerous for a Mountague to be seen in this assembly, yet Benvolio,"
7719,ROMEO AND JULIET,"a friend of Romeo, persuaded the young lord to go to this assembly in"
7720,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the disguise of a mask, that he might see his Rosaline, and seeing her"
7721,ROMEO AND JULIET,"compare her with some choice beauties of Verona, who (he said) would"
7722,ROMEO AND JULIET,make him think his swan a crow. Romeo had small faith in Benvolio's
7723,ROMEO AND JULIET,"words; nevertheless, for the love of Rosaline, he was persuaded to go."
7724,ROMEO AND JULIET,"For Romeo was a sincere and passionate lover, and one that lost his"
7725,ROMEO AND JULIET,"sleep for love, and fled society to be alone, thinking on Rosaline,"
7726,ROMEO AND JULIET,"who disdained him, and never requited his love with the least show of"
7727,ROMEO AND JULIET,courtesy or affection; and Benvolio wished to cure his friend of this
7728,ROMEO AND JULIET,love by shewing him diversity of ladies and company. To this feast of
7729,ROMEO AND JULIET,Capulets then young Romeo with Benvolio and their friend Mercutio went
7730,ROMEO AND JULIET,"masked. Old Capulet bid them welcome, and told them that ladies who"
7731,ROMEO AND JULIET,had their toes unplagued with corns would dance with them. And the old
7732,ROMEO AND JULIET,"man was light-hearted and merry, and said that he had worn a mask when"
7733,ROMEO AND JULIET,"he was young, and could have told a whispering tale in a fair lady's"
7734,ROMEO AND JULIET,"ear. And they fell to dancing, and Romeo was suddenly struck with the"
7735,ROMEO AND JULIET,"exceeding beauty of a lady who danced there, who seemed to him to"
7736,ROMEO AND JULIET,"teach the torches to burn bright, and her beauty to shew by night like"
7737,ROMEO AND JULIET,"a rich jewel worn by a blackamoor: beauty too rich for use, too dear"
7738,ROMEO AND JULIET,"for earth! like a snowy dove trooping with crows (he said), so richly"
7739,ROMEO AND JULIET,did her beauty and perfections shine above the ladies her companions.
7740,ROMEO AND JULIET,"While he uttered these praises, he was overheard by Tybalt, a nephew"
7741,ROMEO AND JULIET,"of lord Capulet, who knew him by his voice to be Romeo. And this"
7742,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Tybalt, being of a fiery and passionate temper, could not endure that"
7743,ROMEO AND JULIET,"a Mountague should come under cover of a mask, to fleer and scorn (as"
7744,ROMEO AND JULIET,"he said) at their solemnities. And he stormed and raged exceedingly,"
7745,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and would have struck young Romeo dead. But his uncle, the old lord"
7746,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Capulet, would not suffer him to do any injury at that time, both out"
7747,ROMEO AND JULIET,"of respect to his guests, and because Romeo had borne himself like a"
7748,ROMEO AND JULIET,"gentleman, and all tongues in Verona bragged of him to be a virtuous"
7749,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and well-governed youth. Tybalt, forced to be patient against his"
7750,ROMEO AND JULIET,"will, restrained himself, but swore that this vile Mountague should at"
7751,ROMEO AND JULIET,another time dearly pay for his intrusion.
7752,ROMEO AND JULIET,
7753,ROMEO AND JULIET,"The dancing being done, Romeo watched the place where the lady stood;"
7754,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and under favour of his masking habit, which might seem to excuse in"
7755,ROMEO AND JULIET,"part the liberty, he presumed in the gentlest manner to take her by"
7756,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the hand, calling it a shrine, which if he prophaned by touching it,"
7757,ROMEO AND JULIET,"he was a blushing pilgrim, and would kiss it for atonement. ""Good"
7758,ROMEO AND JULIET,"pilgrim,"" answered the lady, ""your devotion shews by far too mannerly"
7759,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and too courtly: saints have hands, which pilgrims may touch, but kiss"
7760,ROMEO AND JULIET,"not."" ""Have not saints lips, and pilgrims too?"" said Romeo. ""Aye,"""
7761,ROMEO AND JULIET,"said the lady, ""lips which they must use in prayer."" ""O then, my dear"
7762,ROMEO AND JULIET,"saint,"" said Romeo, ""hear my prayer and grant it, lest I despair."" In"
7763,ROMEO AND JULIET,"such like allusions and loving conceits they were engaged, when the"
7764,ROMEO AND JULIET,lady was called away to her mother. And Romeo enquiring who her mother
7765,ROMEO AND JULIET,"was, discovered that the lady whose peerless beauty he was so much"
7766,ROMEO AND JULIET,"struck with, was young Juliet, daughter and heir to the lord Capulet,"
7767,ROMEO AND JULIET,the great enemy of the Mountagues; and that he had unknowingly engaged
7768,ROMEO AND JULIET,"his heart to his foe. This troubled him, but it could not dissuade"
7769,ROMEO AND JULIET,"him from loving. As little rest had Juliet, when she found that the"
7770,ROMEO AND JULIET,"gentleman that she had been talking with was Romeo and a Mountague,"
7771,ROMEO AND JULIET,for she had been suddenly smit with the same hasty and inconsiderate
7772,ROMEO AND JULIET,"passion for Romeo, which he had conceived for her; and a prodigious"
7773,ROMEO AND JULIET,"birth of love it seemed to her, that she must love her enemy, and that"
7774,ROMEO AND JULIET,"her affections should settle there, where family considerations should"
7775,ROMEO AND JULIET,induce her chiefly to hate.
7776,ROMEO AND JULIET,
7777,ROMEO AND JULIET,"It being midnight, Romeo with his companions departed; but they soon"
7778,ROMEO AND JULIET,"missed him, for unable to stay away from the house where he had left"
7779,ROMEO AND JULIET,"his heart, he leaped the wall of an orchard which was at the back of"
7780,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Juliet's house. Here he had not been long, ruminating on his new love,"
7781,ROMEO AND JULIET,"when Juliet appeared above at a window, through which her exceeding"
7782,ROMEO AND JULIET,beauty seemed to break like the light of the sun in the east; and the
7783,ROMEO AND JULIET,"moon, which shone in the orchard with a faint light, appeared to Romeo"
7784,ROMEO AND JULIET,as if sick and pale with grief at the superior lustre of this new
7785,ROMEO AND JULIET,"sun. And she leaning her hand upon her cheek, he passionately wished"
7786,ROMEO AND JULIET,"himself a glove upon that hand, that he might touch her cheek. She all"
7787,ROMEO AND JULIET,"this while thinking herself alone, fetched a deep sigh, and exclaimed,"
7788,ROMEO AND JULIET,"""Ah me!"" Romeo, enraptured to hear her speak, said softly, and unheard"
7789,ROMEO AND JULIET,"by her, ""O speak again, bright angel, for such you appear, being over"
7790,ROMEO AND JULIET,"my head, like a winged messenger from heaven whom mortals fall back to"
7791,ROMEO AND JULIET,"gaze upon."" She, unconscious of being overheard, and full of the new"
7792,ROMEO AND JULIET,"passion which that night's adventure had given birth to, called upon"
7793,ROMEO AND JULIET,"her lover by name (whom she supposed absent): ""O Romeo, Romeo!"" said"
7794,ROMEO AND JULIET,"she, ""wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father, and refuse thy name,"
7795,ROMEO AND JULIET,"for my sake; or if thou wilt not, be but my sworn love, and I no"
7796,ROMEO AND JULIET,"longer will be a Capulet."" Romeo, having this encouragement, would"
7797,ROMEO AND JULIET,"fain have spoken, but he was desirous of hearing more; and the lady"
7798,ROMEO AND JULIET,"continued her passionate discourse with herself (as she thought),"
7799,ROMEO AND JULIET,"still chiding Romeo for being Romeo and a Mountague, and wishing him"
7800,ROMEO AND JULIET,"some other name, or that he would put away that hated name, and for"
7801,ROMEO AND JULIET,"that name, which was no part of himself, he should take all herself."
7802,ROMEO AND JULIET,"At this loving word Romeo could no longer refrain, but taking up the"
7803,ROMEO AND JULIET,"dialogue as if her words had been addressed to him personally, and not"
7804,ROMEO AND JULIET,"merely in fancy, he bade her call him Love, or by whatever other name"
7805,ROMEO AND JULIET,"she pleased, for he was no longer Romeo, if that name was displeasing"
7806,ROMEO AND JULIET,"to her. Juliet, alarmed to hear a man's voice in the garden, did not"
7807,ROMEO AND JULIET,"at first know who it was, that by favour of the night and darkness"
7808,ROMEO AND JULIET,had thus stumbled upon the discovery of her secret; but when he
7809,ROMEO AND JULIET,"spoke again, though her ears had not yet drunk a hundred words of"
7810,ROMEO AND JULIET,"that tongue's uttering, yet so nice is a lover's hearing, that she"
7811,ROMEO AND JULIET,"immediately knew him to be young Romeo, and she expostulated with him"
7812,ROMEO AND JULIET,on the danger to which he had exposed himself by climbing the orchard
7813,ROMEO AND JULIET,"walls, for if any of her kinsmen should find him there, it would be"
7814,ROMEO AND JULIET,"death to him, being a Mountague. ""Alack,"" said Romeo, ""there is more"
7815,ROMEO AND JULIET,"peril in your eye, than in twenty of their swords. Do you but look"
7816,ROMEO AND JULIET,"kind upon me, lady, and I am proof against their enmity. Better my"
7817,ROMEO AND JULIET,"life should be ended by their hate, than that hated life should be"
7818,ROMEO AND JULIET,"prolonged, to live without your love."" ""How came you into this place,"""
7819,ROMEO AND JULIET,"said Juliet, ""and by whose direction?"" ""Love directed me,"" answered"
7820,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Romeo: ""I am no pilot, yet wert thou as far apart from me, as that"
7821,ROMEO AND JULIET,"vast shore which is washed with the farthest sea, I should adventure"
7822,ROMEO AND JULIET,"for such merchandize."" A crimson blush came over Juliet's face, yet"
7823,ROMEO AND JULIET,"unseen by Romeo by reason of the night, when she reflected upon the"
7824,ROMEO AND JULIET,"discovery which she had made, yet not meaning to make it, of her"
7825,ROMEO AND JULIET,"love to Romeo. She would fain have recalled her words, but that was"
7826,ROMEO AND JULIET,"impossible: fain would she have stood upon form, and have kept her"
7827,ROMEO AND JULIET,"lover at a distance, as the custom of discreet ladies is, to frown and"
7828,ROMEO AND JULIET,"be perverse, and give their suitors harsh denials at first; to stand"
7829,ROMEO AND JULIET,"off, and affect a coyness or indifference, where they most love, that"
7830,ROMEO AND JULIET,their lovers may not think them too lightly or too easily won: for the
7831,ROMEO AND JULIET,difficulty of attainment increases the value of the object. But there
7832,ROMEO AND JULIET,"was no room in her case for denials, or puttings off, or any of the"
7833,ROMEO AND JULIET,customary arts of delay and protracted courtship. Romeo had heard
7834,ROMEO AND JULIET,"from her own tongue, when she did not dream that he was near her, a"
7835,ROMEO AND JULIET,"confession of her love. So with an honest frankness, which the novelty"
7836,ROMEO AND JULIET,"of her situation excused, she confirmed the truth of what he had"
7837,ROMEO AND JULIET,"before heard, and addressing him by the name of _fair Mountague_"
7838,ROMEO AND JULIET,"(love can sweeten a sour name), she begged him not to impute her easy"
7839,ROMEO AND JULIET,"yielding to levity or an unworthy mind, but that he must lay the fault"
7840,ROMEO AND JULIET,of it (if it were a fault) upon the accident of the night which had
7841,ROMEO AND JULIET,"so strangely discovered her thoughts. And she added, that though her"
7842,ROMEO AND JULIET,"behaviour to him might not be sufficiently prudent, measured by the"
7843,ROMEO AND JULIET,"custom of her sex, yet that she would prove more true than many whose"
7844,ROMEO AND JULIET,"prudence was dissembling, and their modesty artificial cunning."
7845,ROMEO AND JULIET,
7846,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Romeo was beginning to call the heavens to witness, that nothing was"
7847,ROMEO AND JULIET,farther from his thoughts than to impute a shadow of dishonour to such
7848,ROMEO AND JULIET,"an honoured lady, when she stopped him, begging him not to swear;"
7849,ROMEO AND JULIET,"for although she joyed in him, yet she had no joy of that night's"
7850,ROMEO AND JULIET,"contract; it was too rash, too unadvised, too sudden. But he being"
7851,ROMEO AND JULIET,"urgent with her to exchange a vow of love with him that night, she"
7852,ROMEO AND JULIET,said that she already had given him hers before he requested it;
7853,ROMEO AND JULIET,"meaning, when he overheard her confession; but she would retract what"
7854,ROMEO AND JULIET,"she then bestowed, for the pleasure of giving it again, for her bounty"
7855,ROMEO AND JULIET,"was as infinite as the sea, and her love as deep. From this loving"
7856,ROMEO AND JULIET,"conference she was called away by her nurse, who slept with her, and"
7857,ROMEO AND JULIET,"thought it time for her to be in bed, for it was near to day-break;"
7858,ROMEO AND JULIET,"but hastily returning, she said three or four words more to Romeo,"
7859,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the purport of which was, that if his love was indeed honourable, and"
7860,ROMEO AND JULIET,"his purpose marriage, she would send a messenger to him to-morrow, to"
7861,ROMEO AND JULIET,"appoint a time for their marriage, when she would lay all her fortunes"
7862,ROMEO AND JULIET,"at his feet, and follow him as her lord through the world. While they"
7863,ROMEO AND JULIET,"were settling this point, Juliet was repeatedly called for by her"
7864,ROMEO AND JULIET,"nurse, and went in and returned, and went and returned again, for she"
7865,ROMEO AND JULIET,"seemed as jealous of Romeo going from her, as a young girl of her"
7866,ROMEO AND JULIET,"bird, which she will let hop a little from her hand, and pluck it"
7867,ROMEO AND JULIET,back with a silken thread; and Romeo was as loth to part as she: for
7868,ROMEO AND JULIET,the sweetest music to lovers is the sound of each other's tongues at
7869,ROMEO AND JULIET,"night. But at last they parted, wishing mutually sweet sleep and rest"
7870,ROMEO AND JULIET,"for that night. The day was breaking when they parted, and Romeo, who"
7871,ROMEO AND JULIET,was too full of thoughts of his mistress and that blessed meeting
7872,ROMEO AND JULIET,"to allow him to sleep, instead of going home, bent his course to a"
7873,ROMEO AND JULIET,"monastery hard by, to find friar Lawrence. The good friar was already"
7874,ROMEO AND JULIET,"up at his devotions, but seeing young Romeo abroad so early, he"
7875,ROMEO AND JULIET,"conjectured rightly that he had not been a-bed that night, but that"
7876,ROMEO AND JULIET,some distemper of youthful affection had kept him waking. He was right
7877,ROMEO AND JULIET,"in imputing the cause of Romeo's wakefulness to love, but he made a"
7878,ROMEO AND JULIET,"wrong guess at the object, for he thought that his love for Rosaline"
7879,ROMEO AND JULIET,had kept him waking. But when Romeo revealed his new passion for
7880,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Juliet, and requested the assistance of the friar to marry them that"
7881,ROMEO AND JULIET,"day, the holy man lifted up his eyes and hands in a sort of wonder at"
7882,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the sudden change in Romeo's affections, for he had been privy to all"
7883,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Romeo's love for Rosaline, and his many complaints of her disdain; and"
7884,ROMEO AND JULIET,"he said, that young men's love lay not truly in their hearts, but in"
7885,ROMEO AND JULIET,their eyes. But Romeo replying that he himself had often chidden him
7886,ROMEO AND JULIET,"for doting on Rosaline, who could not love him again, whereas Juliet"
7887,ROMEO AND JULIET,"both loved and was beloved by him, the friar assented in some measure"
7888,ROMEO AND JULIET,to his reasons; and thinking that a matrimonial alliance between young
7889,ROMEO AND JULIET,Juliet and Romeo might happily be a means of making up the long breach
7890,ROMEO AND JULIET,between the Capulets and the Mountagues; which no one more lamented
7891,ROMEO AND JULIET,"than this good friar, who was a friend to both the families, and had"
7892,ROMEO AND JULIET,often interposed his mediation to make up the quarrel without effect;
7893,ROMEO AND JULIET,"partly moved by policy, and partly by his fondness for young Romeo, to"
7894,ROMEO AND JULIET,"whom he could deny nothing, the old man consented to join their hands"
7895,ROMEO AND JULIET,in marriage.
7896,ROMEO AND JULIET,
7897,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Now was Romeo blest indeed, and Juliet, who knew his intent from a"
7898,ROMEO AND JULIET,"messenger which she had dispatched according to promise, did not fail"
7899,ROMEO AND JULIET,"to be early at the cell of friar Lawrence, where their hands were"
7900,ROMEO AND JULIET,joined in holy marriage; the good friar praying the heavens to smile
7901,ROMEO AND JULIET,"upon that act, and in the union of this young Mountague and young"
7902,ROMEO AND JULIET,Capulet to bury the old strife and long dissensions of their families.
7903,ROMEO AND JULIET,
7904,ROMEO AND JULIET,"The ceremony being over, Juliet hastened home, where she staid"
7905,ROMEO AND JULIET,"impatient for the coming of night, at which time Romeo promised to"
7906,ROMEO AND JULIET,"come and meet her in the orchard, where they had met the night before;"
7907,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and the time between seemed as tedious to her, as the night before"
7908,ROMEO AND JULIET,"some great festival seems to an impatient child, that has got new"
7909,ROMEO AND JULIET,finery which it may not put on till the morning.
7910,ROMEO AND JULIET,
7911,ROMEO AND JULIET,"That same day about noon, Romeo's friends, Benvolio and Mercutio,"
7912,ROMEO AND JULIET,"walking through the streets of Verona, were met by a party of the"
7913,ROMEO AND JULIET,Capulets with the impetuous Tybalt at their head. This was the same
7914,ROMEO AND JULIET,angry Tybalt who would have fought with Romeo at old lord Capulet's
7915,ROMEO AND JULIET,"feast. He seeing Mercutio, accused him bluntly of associating with"
7916,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Romeo, a Mountague. Mercutio, who had as much fire and youthful blood"
7917,ROMEO AND JULIET,"in him as Tybalt, replied to this accusation with some sharpness; and"
7918,ROMEO AND JULIET,"in spite of all Benvolio could say to moderate their wrath, a quarrel"
7919,ROMEO AND JULIET,"was beginning, when Romeo himself passing that way, the fierce"
7920,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Tybalt turned from Mercutio to Romeo, and gave him the disgraceful"
7921,ROMEO AND JULIET,appellation of villain. Romeo wished to avoid a quarrel with Tybalt
7922,ROMEO AND JULIET,"above all men, because he was the kinsman of Juliet, and much beloved"
7923,ROMEO AND JULIET,"by her; besides, this young Mountague had never thoroughly entered"
7924,ROMEO AND JULIET,"into the family quarrel, being by nature wise and gentle, and the name"
7925,ROMEO AND JULIET,"of a Capulet, which was his dear lady's name, was now rather a charm"
7926,ROMEO AND JULIET,"to allay resentment, than a watch-word to excite fury. So he tried"
7927,ROMEO AND JULIET,"to reason with Tybalt, whom he saluted mildly by the name of _good"
7928,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Capulet_, as if he, though a Mountague, had some secret pleasure in"
7929,ROMEO AND JULIET,"uttering that name: but Tybalt, who hated all Mountagues as he hated"
7930,ROMEO AND JULIET,"hell, would hear no reason, but drew his weapon; and Mercutio, who"
7931,ROMEO AND JULIET,"knew not of Romeo's secret motive for desiring peace with Tybalt, but"
7932,ROMEO AND JULIET,looked upon his present forbearance as a sort of calm dishonourable
7933,ROMEO AND JULIET,"submission, with many disdainful words provoked Tybalt to the"
7934,ROMEO AND JULIET,prosecution of his first quarrel with him; and Tybalt and Mercutio
7935,ROMEO AND JULIET,"fought, till Mercutio fell, receiving his death's wound while Romeo"
7936,ROMEO AND JULIET,and Benvolio were vainly endeavouring to part the combatants. Mercutio
7937,ROMEO AND JULIET,"being dead, Romeo kept his temper no longer, but returned the scornful"
7938,ROMEO AND JULIET,appellation of villain which Tybalt had given him; and they fought
7939,ROMEO AND JULIET,till Tybalt was slain by Romeo. This deadly broil falling out in the
7940,ROMEO AND JULIET,"midst of Verona at noonday, the news of it quickly brought a crowd"
7941,ROMEO AND JULIET,"of citizens to the spot, and among them the old lords Capulet and"
7942,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Mountague, with their wives; and soon after arrived the prince"
7943,ROMEO AND JULIET,"himself, who being related to Mercutio, whom Tybalt had slain, and"
7944,ROMEO AND JULIET,having had the peace of his government often disturbed by these
7945,ROMEO AND JULIET,"brawls of Mountagues and Capulets, came determined to put the law in"
7946,ROMEO AND JULIET,strictest force against those who should be found to be offenders.
7947,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Benvolio, who had been eye-witness to the fray, was commanded by the"
7948,ROMEO AND JULIET,"prince to relate the origin of it, which he did, keeping as near the"
7949,ROMEO AND JULIET,"truth as he could without injury to Romeo, softening and excusing the"
7950,ROMEO AND JULIET,"part which his friends took in it. Lady Capulet, whose extreme grief"
7951,ROMEO AND JULIET,for the loss of her kinsman Tybalt made her keep no bounds in her
7952,ROMEO AND JULIET,"revenge, exhorted the prince to do strict justice upon his murderer,"
7953,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and to pay no attention to Benvolio's representation, who being"
7954,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Romeo's friend, and a Mountague, spoke partially. Thus she pleaded"
7955,ROMEO AND JULIET,"against her new son-in-law, but she knew not yet that he was her"
7956,ROMEO AND JULIET,son-in-law and Juliet's husband. On the other hand was to be seen Lady
7957,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Mountague pleading for her child's life, and arguing with some justice"
7958,ROMEO AND JULIET,that Romeo had done nothing worthy of punishment in taking the life
7959,ROMEO AND JULIET,"of Tybalt, which was already forfeited to the law by his having slain"
7960,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Mercutio. The prince, unmoved by the passionate exclamations of these"
7961,ROMEO AND JULIET,"women, on a careful examination of the facts, pronounced his sentence,"
7962,ROMEO AND JULIET,and by that sentence Romeo was banished from Verona.
7963,ROMEO AND JULIET,
7964,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Heavy news to young Juliet, who had been but a few hours a bride,"
7965,ROMEO AND JULIET,and now by this decree seemed everlastingly divorced! When the
7966,ROMEO AND JULIET,"tidings reached her, she at first gave way to rage against Romeo,"
7967,ROMEO AND JULIET,"who had slain her dear cousin: she called him a beautiful tyrant,"
7968,ROMEO AND JULIET,"a fiend angelical, a ravenous dove, a lamb with a wolf's nature, a"
7969,ROMEO AND JULIET,"serpent-heart hid with a flowering face, and other like contradictory"
7970,ROMEO AND JULIET,"names, which denoted the struggles in her mind between her love and"
7971,ROMEO AND JULIET,"her resentment: but in the end love got the mastery, and the tears"
7972,ROMEO AND JULIET,"which she shed for grief that Romeo had slain her cousin, turned to"
7973,ROMEO AND JULIET,drops of joy that her husband lived whom Tybalt would have slain.
7974,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Then came fresh tears, and they were altogether of grief for Romeo's"
7975,ROMEO AND JULIET,banishment. That word was more terrible to her than the death of many
7976,ROMEO AND JULIET,Tybalts.
7977,ROMEO AND JULIET,
7978,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Romeo, after the fray, had taken refuge in friar Lawrence's cell,"
7979,ROMEO AND JULIET,"where he was first made acquainted with the prince's sentence, which"
7980,ROMEO AND JULIET,seemed to him far more terrible than death. To him it appeared there
7981,ROMEO AND JULIET,"was no world out of Verona's walls, no living out of the sight of"
7982,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Juliet. Heaven was there where Juliet lived, and all beyond was"
7983,ROMEO AND JULIET,"purgatory, torture, hell. The good friar would have applied the"
7984,ROMEO AND JULIET,consolation of philosophy to his griefs; but this frantic young man
7985,ROMEO AND JULIET,"would hear of none, but like a madman he tore his hair, and threw"
7986,ROMEO AND JULIET,"himself all along upon the ground, as he said, to take the measure of"
7987,ROMEO AND JULIET,his grave. From this unseemly state he was roused by a message from
7988,ROMEO AND JULIET,"his dear lady, which a little revived him, and then the friar took the"
7989,ROMEO AND JULIET,advantage to expostulate with him on the unmanly weakness which he had
7990,ROMEO AND JULIET,"shown. He had slain Tybalt, but would he also slay himself, slay his"
7991,ROMEO AND JULIET,"dear lady who lived but in his life? The noble form of man, he said,"
7992,ROMEO AND JULIET,"was but a shape of wax, when it wanted the courage which should keep"
7993,ROMEO AND JULIET,"it firm. The law had been lenient to him, that instead of death which"
7994,ROMEO AND JULIET,"he had incurred, had pronounced by the prince's mouth only banishment."
7995,ROMEO AND JULIET,"He had slain Tybalt, but Tybalt would have slain him: there was a sort"
7996,ROMEO AND JULIET,"of happiness in that. Juliet was alive, and (beyond all hope) had"
7997,ROMEO AND JULIET,"become his dear wife, therein he was most happy. All these blessings,"
7998,ROMEO AND JULIET,"as the friar made them out to be, did Romeo put from him like a sullen"
7999,ROMEO AND JULIET,"misbehaved wench. And the friar bade him beware, for such as despaired"
8000,ROMEO AND JULIET,"(he said) died miserable. Then when Romeo was a little calmed, he"
8001,ROMEO AND JULIET,counselled him that he should go that night and secretly take his
8002,ROMEO AND JULIET,"leave of Juliet, and thence proceed straitways to Mantua, at which"
8003,ROMEO AND JULIET,"place he should sojourn, till the friar found a fit occasion to"
8004,ROMEO AND JULIET,"publish his marriage, which might be a joyful means of reconciling"
8005,ROMEO AND JULIET,their families; and then he did not doubt but the prince would be
8006,ROMEO AND JULIET,"moved to pardon him, and he would return with twenty times more joy"
8007,ROMEO AND JULIET,than he went forth with grief. Romeo was convinced by these wise
8008,ROMEO AND JULIET,"counsels of the friar, and took his leave to go and seek his lady,"
8009,ROMEO AND JULIET,"proposing to stay with her that night, and by day-break pursue his"
8010,ROMEO AND JULIET,journey alone to Mantua; to which place the good friar promised to
8011,ROMEO AND JULIET,"send him letters from time to time, acquainting him with the state of"
8012,ROMEO AND JULIET,affairs at home.
8013,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8014,ROMEO AND JULIET,"That night Romeo passed with his dear wife, gaining secret admission"
8015,ROMEO AND JULIET,"to her chamber, from the orchard in which he had heard her confession"
8016,ROMEO AND JULIET,of love the night before. That had been a night of unmixed joy and
8017,ROMEO AND JULIET,"rapture; but the pleasures of this night, and the delight which these"
8018,ROMEO AND JULIET,"lovers took in each other's society, were sadly allayed with the"
8019,ROMEO AND JULIET,"prospect of parting, and the fatal adventures of the past day. The"
8020,ROMEO AND JULIET,"unwelcome day-break seemed to come too soon, and when Juliet heard the"
8021,ROMEO AND JULIET,"morning-song of the lark, she would have persuaded herself that it was"
8022,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the nightingale, which sings by night; but it was too truly the lark"
8023,ROMEO AND JULIET,"which sung, and a discordant and unpleasing note it seemed to her; and"
8024,ROMEO AND JULIET,the streaks of day in the east too certainly pointed out that it was
8025,ROMEO AND JULIET,time for these lovers to part. Romeo took his leave of his dear wife
8026,ROMEO AND JULIET,"with a heavy heart, promising to write to her from Mantua every hour"
8027,ROMEO AND JULIET,"in the day, and when he had descended from her chamber-window, as he"
8028,ROMEO AND JULIET,"stood below her on the ground, in that sad foreboding state of mind in"
8029,ROMEO AND JULIET,which she was he appeared to her eyes as one dead in the bottom of a
8030,ROMEO AND JULIET,tomb. Romeo's mind misgave him in like manner; but now he was forced
8031,ROMEO AND JULIET,"hastily to depart, for it was death for him to be found within the"
8032,ROMEO AND JULIET,walls of Verona after day-break.
8033,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8034,ROMEO AND JULIET,This was but the beginning of the tragedy of this pair of star-crossed
8035,ROMEO AND JULIET,"lovers. Romeo had not been gone many days, before the old lord Capulet"
8036,ROMEO AND JULIET,"proposed a match for Juliet. The husband he had chosen for her, not"
8037,ROMEO AND JULIET,"dreaming that she was married already, was count Paris, a gallant,"
8038,ROMEO AND JULIET,"young, and noble gentleman, no unworthy suitor to the young Juliet,"
8039,ROMEO AND JULIET,if she had never seen Romeo.
8040,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8041,ROMEO AND JULIET,The terrified Juliet was in a sad perplexity at her father's offer.
8042,ROMEO AND JULIET,"She pleaded her youth unsuitable to marriage, the recent death of"
8043,ROMEO AND JULIET,Tybalt which had left her spirits too weak to meet a husband with
8044,ROMEO AND JULIET,"any face of joy, and how indecorous it would shew for the family of"
8045,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the Capulets to be celebrating a nuptial-feast, when his funeral"
8046,ROMEO AND JULIET,solemnities were hardly over: she pleaded every reason against the
8047,ROMEO AND JULIET,"match, but the true one, namely, that she was married already. But"
8048,ROMEO AND JULIET,"lord Capulet was deaf to all her excuses, and in a peremptory manner"
8049,ROMEO AND JULIET,"ordered her to get ready, for by the following Thursday she should"
8050,ROMEO AND JULIET,"be married to Paris: and having found her a husband rich, young, and"
8051,ROMEO AND JULIET,"noble, such as the proudest maid in Verona might joyfully accept, he"
8052,ROMEO AND JULIET,"could not bear that out of an affected coyness, as he construed her"
8053,ROMEO AND JULIET,"denial, she should oppose obstacles to her own good fortune."
8054,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8055,ROMEO AND JULIET,"In this extremity Juliet applied to the friendly friar, always her"
8056,ROMEO AND JULIET,"counsellor in distress, and he asking her if she had resolution to"
8057,ROMEO AND JULIET,"undertake a desperate remedy, and she answering that she would go into"
8058,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the grave alive, rather than marry Paris, her own dear husband living,"
8059,ROMEO AND JULIET,"he directed her to go home, and appear merry, and give her consent to"
8060,ROMEO AND JULIET,"marry Paris, according to her father's desire, and on the next night,"
8061,ROMEO AND JULIET,"which was the night before the marriage, to drink of the contents of"
8062,ROMEO AND JULIET,"a phial which he then gave her, the effect of which would be, that"
8063,ROMEO AND JULIET,for two-and-forty hours after drinking it she should appear cold and
8064,ROMEO AND JULIET,"lifeless; that when the bridegroom came to fetch her in the morning,"
8065,ROMEO AND JULIET,"he would find her to appearance dead; that then she would be borne, as"
8066,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the manner in that country was, uncovered, on a bier, to be buried in"
8067,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the family vault; that if she could put off womanish fear, and consent"
8068,ROMEO AND JULIET,"to this terrible trial, in forty-two hours after swallowing the liquid"
8069,ROMEO AND JULIET,"(such was its certain operation) she would be sure to awake, as from"
8070,ROMEO AND JULIET,"a dream; and before she should awake, he would let her husband know"
8071,ROMEO AND JULIET,"their drift, and he should come in the night, and bear her thence"
8072,ROMEO AND JULIET,"to Mantua. Love, and the dread of marrying Paris, gave young Juliet"
8073,ROMEO AND JULIET,strength to undertake this horrible adventure; and she took the phial
8074,ROMEO AND JULIET,"of the friar, promising to observe his directions."
8075,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8076,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Going from the monastery, she met the young count Paris, and, modestly"
8077,ROMEO AND JULIET,"dissembling, promised to become his bride. This was joyful news to the"
8078,ROMEO AND JULIET,lord Capulet and his wife. It seemed to put youth into the old man:
8079,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and Juliet, who had displeased him exceedingly by her refusal of the"
8080,ROMEO AND JULIET,"count, was his darling again, now she promised to be obedient. All"
8081,ROMEO AND JULIET,things in the house were in a bustle against the approaching nuptials.
8082,ROMEO AND JULIET,"No cost was spared to prepare such festival rejoicings, as Verona had"
8083,ROMEO AND JULIET,never before witnessed.
8084,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8085,ROMEO AND JULIET,On the Wednesday night Juliet drank off the potion. She had many
8086,ROMEO AND JULIET,"misgivings, lest the friar, to avoid the blame which might be imputed"
8087,ROMEO AND JULIET,"to him for marrying her to Romeo, had given her poison; but then he"
8088,ROMEO AND JULIET,was always known for a holy man: then lest she should awake before the
8089,ROMEO AND JULIET,"time that Romeo was to come for her; whether the terror of the place,"
8090,ROMEO AND JULIET,"a vault full of dead Capulets' bones, and where Tybalt, all bloody,"
8091,ROMEO AND JULIET,"lay festering in his shroud, would not be enough to drive her"
8092,ROMEO AND JULIET,distracted: again she thought of all the stories she had heard of
8093,ROMEO AND JULIET,spirits haunting the places where their bodies are bestowed. But then
8094,ROMEO AND JULIET,"her love for Romeo, and her aversion for Paris, returned, and she"
8095,ROMEO AND JULIET,"desperately swallowed the draught, and became insensible."
8096,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8097,ROMEO AND JULIET,"When young Paris came early in the morning with music, to awaken his"
8098,ROMEO AND JULIET,"bride, instead of a living Juliet, her chamber presented the dreary"
8099,ROMEO AND JULIET,spectacle of a lifeless corse. What death to his hopes! What confusion
8100,ROMEO AND JULIET,"then reigned through the whole house! Poor Paris lamenting his bride,"
8101,ROMEO AND JULIET,"whom most detestable death had beguiled him of, had divorced from him"
8102,ROMEO AND JULIET,even before their hands were joined. But still more piteous it was to
8103,ROMEO AND JULIET,"hear the mournings of the old lord and lady Capulet, who having but"
8104,ROMEO AND JULIET,"this one, one poor loving child to rejoice and solace in, cruel death"
8105,ROMEO AND JULIET,"had snatched her from their sight, just as these careful parents were"
8106,ROMEO AND JULIET,on the point of seeing her advanced (as they thought) by a promising
8107,ROMEO AND JULIET,and advantageous match. Now all things that were ordained for the
8108,ROMEO AND JULIET,"festival, were turned from their properties to do the office of a"
8109,ROMEO AND JULIET,"black funeral. The wedding cheer served for a sad burial feast, the"
8110,ROMEO AND JULIET,"bridal hymns were changed to sullen dirges, the sprightly instruments"
8111,ROMEO AND JULIET,"to melancholy bells, and the flowers that should have been strewed in"
8112,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the bride's path, now served but to strew her corse. Now instead of"
8113,ROMEO AND JULIET,"a priest to marry her, a priest was needed to bury her; and she was"
8114,ROMEO AND JULIET,"borne to church indeed, not to augment the cheerful hopes of the"
8115,ROMEO AND JULIET,"living, but to swell the dreary numbers of the dead."
8116,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8117,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Bad news, which always travels faster than good, now brought the"
8118,ROMEO AND JULIET,"dismal story of his Juliet's death to Romeo at Mantua, before the"
8119,ROMEO AND JULIET,"messenger could arrive, who was sent from friar Lawrence to apprize"
8120,ROMEO AND JULIET,him that these were mock funerals only and but the shadow and
8121,ROMEO AND JULIET,"representation of death, and that his dear lady lay in the tomb but"
8122,ROMEO AND JULIET,"for a short while, expecting when Romeo would come to release her from"
8123,ROMEO AND JULIET,"that dreary mansion. Just before, Romeo had been unusually joyful and"
8124,ROMEO AND JULIET,light-hearted. He had dreamed in the night that he was dead (a strange
8125,ROMEO AND JULIET,"dream, that gave a dead man leave to think), and that his lady came"
8126,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and found him dead, and breathed such life with kisses in his lips,"
8127,ROMEO AND JULIET,"that he revived, and was an emperor! And now that a messenger came"
8128,ROMEO AND JULIET,"from Verona, he thought surely it was to confirm some good news which"
8129,ROMEO AND JULIET,his dreams had presaged. But when the contrary to this flattering
8130,ROMEO AND JULIET,"vision appeared, and that it was his lady who was dead in truth, whom"
8131,ROMEO AND JULIET,"he could not revive by any kisses, he ordered horses to be got ready,"
8132,ROMEO AND JULIET,"for he determined that night to visit Verona, and to see his lady"
8133,ROMEO AND JULIET,in her tomb. And as mischief is swift to enter into the thoughts of
8134,ROMEO AND JULIET,"desperate men, he called to mind a poor apothecary, whose shop in"
8135,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Mantua he had lately passed, and from the beggarly appearance of"
8136,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the man, who seemed famished, and the wretched show in his shop of"
8137,ROMEO AND JULIET,"empty boxes ranged on dirty shelves, and other tokens of extreme"
8138,ROMEO AND JULIET,"wretchedness, he had said at the time (perhaps having some misgivings"
8139,ROMEO AND JULIET,that his own disastrous life might haply meet with a conclusion so
8140,ROMEO AND JULIET,"desperate), ""If a man were to need poison, which by the law of Mantua"
8141,ROMEO AND JULIET,"it is death to sell, here lives a poor wretch who would sell it him."""
8142,ROMEO AND JULIET,"These words of his now came into his mind, and he sought out the"
8143,ROMEO AND JULIET,"apothecary, who, after some pretended scruples, Romeo offering him"
8144,ROMEO AND JULIET,"gold which his poverty could not resist, sold him a poison, which, if"
8145,ROMEO AND JULIET,"he swallowed, he told him, if he had the strength of twenty men, would"
8146,ROMEO AND JULIET,quickly dispatch him.
8147,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8148,ROMEO AND JULIET,"With this poison he set out for Verona, to have a sight of his dear"
8149,ROMEO AND JULIET,"lady in her tomb, meaning, when he had satisfied his sight, to swallow"
8150,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the poison, and be buried by her side. He reached Verona at midnight,"
8151,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and found the church-yard, in the midst of which was situated the"
8152,ROMEO AND JULIET,"ancient tomb of the Capulets. He had provided a light, and a spade,"
8153,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and wrenching iron, and was proceeding to break open the monument,"
8154,ROMEO AND JULIET,"when he was interrupted by a voice, which by the name of _vile"
8155,ROMEO AND JULIET,Mountague_ bade him desist from his unlawful business. It was the
8156,ROMEO AND JULIET,"young count Paris, who had come to the tomb of Juliet at that"
8157,ROMEO AND JULIET,"unseasonable time of night, to strew flowers and to weep over the"
8158,ROMEO AND JULIET,grave of her that should have been his bride. He knew not what an
8159,ROMEO AND JULIET,"interest Romeo had in the dead, but knowing him to be a Mountague,"
8160,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and (as he supposed) a sworn foe to all the Capulets, he judged that"
8161,ROMEO AND JULIET,he was come by night to do some villanous shame to the dead bodies;
8162,ROMEO AND JULIET,"therefore in an angry tone he bade him desist; and as a criminal,"
8163,ROMEO AND JULIET,condemned by the laws of Verona to die if he were found within the
8164,ROMEO AND JULIET,"walls of the city, he would have apprehended him. Romeo urged Paris to"
8165,ROMEO AND JULIET,"leave him, and warned him by the fate of Tybalt who lay buried there,"
8166,ROMEO AND JULIET,"not to provoke his anger, or draw down another sin upon his head, by"
8167,ROMEO AND JULIET,"forcing him to kill him. But the count in scorn refused his warning,"
8168,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and laid hands on him as a felon, which Romeo resisting, they fought,"
8169,ROMEO AND JULIET,"and Paris fell. When Romeo, by the help of a light, came to see who it"
8170,ROMEO AND JULIET,"was that he had slain, that it was Paris, who (he learned in his way"
8171,ROMEO AND JULIET,"from Mantua) should have married Juliet, he took the dead youth by the"
8172,ROMEO AND JULIET,"hand, as one whom misfortune had made a companion, and said that he"
8173,ROMEO AND JULIET,"would bury him in a triumphal grave, meaning in Juliet's grave, which"
8174,ROMEO AND JULIET,"he now opened: and there lay his lady, as one whom death had no power"
8175,ROMEO AND JULIET,"upon to change a feature or complexion in her matchless beauty, or as"
8176,ROMEO AND JULIET,"if Death were amorous, and the lean abhorred monster kept her there"
8177,ROMEO AND JULIET,"for his delight; for she lay yet fresh and blooming, as she had fallen"
8178,ROMEO AND JULIET,to sleep when she swallowed that benumbing potion: and near her lay
8179,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Tybalt in his bloody shroud, whom Romeo seeing, begged pardon of his"
8180,ROMEO AND JULIET,"lifeless corse, and for Juliet's sake called him _cousin_, and said"
8181,ROMEO AND JULIET,that he was about to do him a favour by putting his enemy to death.
8182,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Here Romeo took his last leave of his lady's lips, kissing them; and"
8183,ROMEO AND JULIET,"here he shook the burden of his cross stars from his weary body,"
8184,ROMEO AND JULIET,"swallowing that poison which the apothecary had sold him, whose"
8185,ROMEO AND JULIET,"operation was fatal and real, not like that dissembling potion which"
8186,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Juliet had swallowed, the effect of which was now nearly expiring, and"
8187,ROMEO AND JULIET,"she about to awake to complain that Romeo had not kept his time, or"
8188,ROMEO AND JULIET,that he had come too soon.
8189,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8190,ROMEO AND JULIET,For now the hour was arrived at which the friar had promised that she
8191,ROMEO AND JULIET,"should awake; and he, having learned that his letters which he had"
8192,ROMEO AND JULIET,"sent to Mantua, by some unlucky detention of the messenger, had never"
8193,ROMEO AND JULIET,"reached Romeo, came himself, provided with a pick-axe and lantern, to"
8194,ROMEO AND JULIET,deliver the lady from her confinement; but he was surprised to find a
8195,ROMEO AND JULIET,"light already burning in the Capulets' monument, and to see swords and"
8196,ROMEO AND JULIET,"blood near it, and Romeo and Paris lying breathless by the monument."
8197,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8198,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Before he could entertain a conjecture, to imagine how these fatal"
8199,ROMEO AND JULIET,"accidents had fallen out, Juliet awoke out of her trance, and seeing"
8200,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the friar near her, she remembered the place where she was, and the"
8201,ROMEO AND JULIET,"occasion of her being there, and asked for Romeo: but the friar,"
8202,ROMEO AND JULIET,"hearing a noise, bade her come out of that place of death, and of"
8203,ROMEO AND JULIET,"unnatural sleep, for a greater power than they could contradict had"
8204,ROMEO AND JULIET,thwarted their intents; and being frighted by the noise of people
8205,ROMEO AND JULIET,"coming, he fled; but when Juliet saw the cup closed in her true love's"
8206,ROMEO AND JULIET,"hands, she guessed that poison had been the cause of his end, and she"
8207,ROMEO AND JULIET,"would have swallowed the dregs if any had been left, and she kissed"
8208,ROMEO AND JULIET,his still warm lips to try if any poison yet did hang upon them: then
8209,ROMEO AND JULIET,"hearing a nearer noise of people coming, she quickly unsheathed a"
8210,ROMEO AND JULIET,"dagger which she wore, and stabbing herself, died by her true Romeo's"
8211,ROMEO AND JULIET,side.
8212,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8213,ROMEO AND JULIET,The watch by this time had come up to the place. A page belonging to
8214,ROMEO AND JULIET,"count Paris, who had witnessed the fight between his master and Romeo,"
8215,ROMEO AND JULIET,"had given the alarm, which had spread among the citizens, who went"
8216,ROMEO AND JULIET,"up and down the streets of Verona confusedly, exclaiming, A Paris, a"
8217,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Romeo, a Juliet, as the rumour had imperfectly reached them, till the"
8218,ROMEO AND JULIET,"uproar brought lord Mountague and lord Capulet out of their beds,"
8219,ROMEO AND JULIET,"with the prince, to enquire into the causes of the disturbance. The"
8220,ROMEO AND JULIET,"friar had been apprehended by some of the watch, coming from the"
8221,ROMEO AND JULIET,"church-yard, trembling, sighing, and weeping, in a suspicious manner."
8222,ROMEO AND JULIET,"A great multitude being assembled at the Capulets' monument, the friar"
8223,ROMEO AND JULIET,was commanded by the prince to deliver what he knew of these strange
8224,ROMEO AND JULIET,and disastrous accidents.
8225,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8226,ROMEO AND JULIET,"And there, in the presence of the old lords Mountague and Capulet, he"
8227,ROMEO AND JULIET,"faithfully related the story of their children's fatal love, the part"
8228,ROMEO AND JULIET,"he took in promoting their marriage, in the hope in that union to end"
8229,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the long quarrels between their families; how Romeo, there dead, was"
8230,ROMEO AND JULIET,"husband to Juliet, and Juliet, there dead, was Romeo's faithful wife:"
8231,ROMEO AND JULIET,"how before he could find a fit opportunity to divulge their marriage,"
8232,ROMEO AND JULIET,"another match was projected for Juliet, who to avoid the crime of a"
8233,ROMEO AND JULIET,"second marriage swallowed the sleeping draught (as he advised), and"
8234,ROMEO AND JULIET,"all thought her dead: how meantime he wrote to Romeo, to come and take"
8235,ROMEO AND JULIET,"her thence when the force of the potion should cease, and by what"
8236,ROMEO AND JULIET,unfortunate miscarriage of the messenger the letters never reached
8237,ROMEO AND JULIET,"Romeo: further than this the friar could not follow the story, nor"
8238,ROMEO AND JULIET,knew more than that coming himself to deliver Juliet from that place
8239,ROMEO AND JULIET,"of death, he found the count Paris and Romeo slain. The remainder of"
8240,ROMEO AND JULIET,the transactions was supplied by the narration of the page who had
8241,ROMEO AND JULIET,"seen Paris and Romeo fight, and by the servant who came with Romeo"
8242,ROMEO AND JULIET,"from Verona, to whom this faithful lover had given letters to be"
8243,ROMEO AND JULIET,delivered to his father in the event of his death which made good the
8244,ROMEO AND JULIET,"friar's words, confessing his marriage with Juliet, imploring the"
8245,ROMEO AND JULIET,"forgiveness of his parents, acknowledging the buying of the poison of"
8246,ROMEO AND JULIET,"the poor apothecary, and his intent in coming to the monument, to die,"
8247,ROMEO AND JULIET,and lie with Juliet. All these circumstances agreed together to clear
8248,ROMEO AND JULIET,the friar from any hand he could be supposed to have had in these
8249,ROMEO AND JULIET,"complicated slaughters, further than as the unintended consequences of"
8250,ROMEO AND JULIET,"his own well meant, yet too artificial and subtle contrivances."
8251,ROMEO AND JULIET,
8252,ROMEO AND JULIET,"And the prince, turning to these old lords, Mountague and Capulet,"
8253,ROMEO AND JULIET,"rebuked them for their brutal and irrational enmities, and shewed"
8254,ROMEO AND JULIET,"them what a scourge heaven had laid upon such offences, that it had"
8255,ROMEO AND JULIET,found means even through the love of their children to punish their
8256,ROMEO AND JULIET,"unnatural hate. And these old rivals, no longer enemies, agreed to"
8257,ROMEO AND JULIET,bury their long strife in their children's graves; and lord Capulet
8258,ROMEO AND JULIET,"requested lord Mountague to give him his hand, calling him by the name"
8259,ROMEO AND JULIET,"of brother, as if in acknowledgment of the union of their families by"
8260,ROMEO AND JULIET,the marriage of the young Capulet and Mountague; and saying that lord
8261,ROMEO AND JULIET,Mountague's hand (in token of reconcilement) was all he demanded for
8262,ROMEO AND JULIET,his daughter's jointure: but lord Mountague said he would give him
8263,ROMEO AND JULIET,"more, for he would raise her statue of pure gold, that while Verona"
8264,ROMEO AND JULIET,"kept its name, no figure should be so esteemed for its richness and"
8265,ROMEO AND JULIET,workmanship as that of the true and faithful Juliet. And lord Capulet
8266,ROMEO AND JULIET,in return said that he would raise another statue to Romeo. So did
8267,ROMEO AND JULIET,"these poor old lords, when it was too late, strive to outgo each other"
8268,ROMEO AND JULIET,in mutual courtesies: while so deadly had been their rage and enmity
8269,ROMEO AND JULIET,"in past times, that nothing but the fearful overthrow of their"
8270,ROMEO AND JULIET,children (poor sacrifices to their quarrels and dissensions) could
8271,ROMEO AND JULIET,remove the rooted hates and jealousies of the noble families.

8278,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",(_By Charles Lamb_)
8279,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8280,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8281,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Gertrude, queen of Denmark, becoming a widow by the sudden death of"
8282,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","King Hamlet, in less than two months after his death married his"
8283,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","brother Claudius, which was noted by all people at the time for a"
8284,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","strange act of indiscretion, or unfeelingness, or worse: for this"
8285,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",Claudius did no ways resemble her late husband in the qualities of his
8286,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","person or his mind, but was as contemptible in outward appearance, as"
8287,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",he was base and unworthy in disposition; and suspicions did not fail
8288,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to arise in the minds of some, that he had privately made away with"
8289,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his brother, the late king, with the view of marrying his widow, and"
8290,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","ascending the throne of Denmark, to the exclusion of young Hamlet, the"
8291,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","son of the buried king, and lawful successor to the throne."
8292,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8293,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",But upon no one did this unadvised action of the queen make such
8294,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","impression as upon this young prince, who loved and venerated the"
8295,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","memory of his dead father almost to idolatry, and being of a nice"
8296,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","sense of honour, and a most exquisite practiser of propriety himself,"
8297,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",did sorely take to heart this unworthy conduct of his mother Gertrude:
8298,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","insomuch that, between grief for his father's death and shame for"
8299,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his mother's marriage, this young prince was overclouded with a deep"
8300,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","melancholy, and lost all his mirth and all his good looks; all his"
8301,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","customary pleasure in books forsook him, his princely exercises and"
8302,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","sports, proper to his youth, were no longer acceptable; he grew weary"
8303,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","of the world, which seemed to him an unweeded garden, where all"
8304,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the wholesome flowers were choaked up, and nothing but weeds could"
8305,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","thrive. Not that the prospect of exclusion from the throne, his lawful"
8306,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","inheritance, weighed so much upon his spirits, though that to a young"
8307,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",and high-minded prince was a bitter wound and a sore indignity; but
8308,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","what so galled him, and took away all his cheerful spirits, was, that"
8309,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",his mother had shewn herself so forgetful to his father's memory: and
8310,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",such a father! who had been to her so loving and so gentle a husband!
8311,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","and then she always appeared as loving and obedient a wife to him, and"
8312,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",would hang upon him as if her affection grew to him: and now within
8313,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","two months, or as it seemed to young Hamlet, less than two months, she"
8314,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","had married again, married his uncle, her dead husband's brother, in"
8315,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","itself a highly improper and unlawful marriage, from the nearness of"
8316,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","relationship, but made much more so by the indecent haste with which"
8317,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","it was concluded, and the unkingly character of the man whom she had"
8318,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","chosen to be the partner of her throne and bed. This it was which,"
8319,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","more than the loss of ten kingdoms, dashed the spirits, and brought a"
8320,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",cloud over the mind of this honourable young prince.
8321,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8322,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",In vain was all that his mother Gertrude or the king could do to
8323,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",contrive to divert him; he still appeared in court in a suit of deep
8324,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","black, as mourning for the king his father's death, which mode of"
8325,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","dress he had never laid aside, not even in compliment to his mother"
8326,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","upon the day she was married, nor could he be brought to join in"
8327,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",any of the festivities or rejoicings of that (as appeared to him)
8328,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",disgraceful day.
8329,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8330,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",What mostly troubled him was an uncertainty about the manner of his
8331,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","father's death. It was given out by Claudius, that a serpent had stung"
8332,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",him: but young Hamlet had shrewd suspicions that Claudius himself was
8333,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the serpent; in plain English, that he had murdered him for his crown,"
8334,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",and that the serpent who stung his father did now sit on the throne.
8335,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8336,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","How far he was right in this conjecture, and what he ought to think of"
8337,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his mother, how far she was privy to this murder, and whether by her"
8338,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","consent or knowledge, or without, it came to pass, were the doubts"
8339,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",which continually harassed and distracted him.
8340,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8341,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","A rumour had reached the ear of young Hamlet, that an apparition,"
8342,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","exactly resembling the dead king his father, had been seen by the"
8343,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","soldiers upon watch, on the platform before the palace at midnight,"
8344,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",for two or three nights successively. The figure came constantly clad
8345,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","in the same suit of armour, from head to foot, which the dead king was"
8346,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",known to have worn: and they who saw it (Hamlet's bosom-friend Horatio
8347,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",was one) agreed in their testimony as to the time and manner of its
8348,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",appearance: that it came just as the clock struck twelve; that it
8349,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","looked pale, with a face more of sorrow than of anger; that its beard"
8350,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","was grisly, and the colour a _sable silvered_, as they had seen it in"
8351,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his life-time: that it made no answer when they spoke to it, yet once"
8352,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","they thought it lifted up its head, and addressed itself to motion, as"
8353,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","if it were about to speak; but in that moment the morning cock crew,"
8354,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","and it shrunk in haste away, and vanished out of their sight."
8355,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8356,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","The young prince, strangely amazed at their relation, which was too"
8357,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","consistent and agreeing with itself to disbelieve, concluded that it"
8358,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","was his father's ghost which they had seen, and determined to take his"
8359,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","watch with the soldiers that night, that he might have a chance of"
8360,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","seeing it: for he reasoned with himself, that such an appearance did"
8361,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","not come for nothing, but that the ghost had something to impart, and"
8362,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","though it had been silent hitherto, yet it would speak to him. And he"
8363,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",waited with impatience for the coming of night.
8364,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8365,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","When night came he took his stand with Horatio, and Marcellus one of"
8366,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the guard, upon the platform, where this apparition was accustomed"
8367,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to walk: and it being a cold night, and the air unusually raw and"
8368,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","nipping, Hamlet and Horatio and their companion fell into some talk"
8369,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","about the coldness of the night, which was suddenly broken off by"
8370,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",Horatio announcing that the ghost was coming.
8371,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8372,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","At the sight of his father's spirit, Hamlet was struck with a sudden"
8373,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",surprize and fear. He at first called upon the angels and heavenly
8374,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","ministers to defend them, for he knew not whether it were a good"
8375,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",spirit or bad; whether it came for good or for evil: but he gradually
8376,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",assumed more courage; and his father (as it seemed to him) looked upon
8377,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","him so piteously, and, as it were desiring to have conversation with"
8378,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","him, and did in all respects appear so like himself as he was when he"
8379,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","lived, that Hamlet could not help addressing him: he called him by"
8380,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his name, Hamlet, King, Father! and conjured him that he would tell"
8381,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the reason why he had left his grave, where they had seen him quietly"
8382,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","bestowed, to come again and visit the earth and the moonlight: and"
8383,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",besought him that he would let them know if there was any thing which
8384,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",they could do to give peace to his spirit. And the ghost beckoned to
8385,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Hamlet, that he should go with him to some more removed place, where"
8386,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",they might be alone: and Horatio and Marcellus would have dissuaded
8387,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the young prince from following it, for they feared lest it should be"
8388,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","some evil spirit, who would tempt him to the neighbouring sea, or to"
8389,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the top of some dreadful cliff, and there put on some horrible shape"
8390,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",which might deprive the prince of his reason. But their counsels and
8391,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","intreaties could not alter Hamlet's determination, who cared too"
8392,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","little about life to fear the losing of it; and as to his soul, he"
8393,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","said, what could the spirit do to that, being a thing immortal as"
8394,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","itself? and he felt as hardy as a lion, and bursting from them who did"
8395,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","all they could to hold him, he followed whithersoever the spirit led"
8396,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",him.
8397,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8398,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","And when they were alone together, the spirit broke silence, and told"
8399,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","him that he was the ghost of Hamlet, his father, who had been cruelly"
8400,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","murdered, and he told the manner of it; that it was done by his own"
8401,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","brother Claudius, Hamlet's uncle, as Hamlet had already but too much"
8402,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","suspected, for the hope of succeeding to his bed and crown. That as he"
8403,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","was sleeping in his garden, his custom always in the afternoon, his"
8404,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","treasonous brother stole upon him in his sleep, and poured the juice"
8405,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","of poisonous henbane into his ears, which has such an antipathy to"
8406,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the life of man, that swift as quicksilver it courses through all the"
8407,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","veins of the body, baking up the blood, and spreading a crust-like"
8408,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","leprosy all over the skin: thus sleeping, by a brother's hand he"
8409,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","was cut off at once from his crown, his queen, and his life: and he"
8410,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","adjured Hamlet, if he did ever his dear father love, that he would"
8411,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","revenge his foul murder. And the ghost lamented to his son, that his"
8412,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","mother should so fall off from virtue, as to prove false to the wedded"
8413,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","love of her first husband, and to marry his murderer: but he cautioned"
8414,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Hamlet, howsoever he proceeded in his revenge against his wicked"
8415,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","uncle, by no means to act any violence against the person of his"
8416,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","mother, but to leave her to heaven, and to the stings and thorns of"
8417,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",conscience. And Hamlet promised to observe the ghost's direction in
8418,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","all things, and the ghost vanished."
8419,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8420,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","And when Hamlet was left alone, he took up a solemn resolution, that"
8421,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","all he had in his memory, all that he had ever learned by books or"
8422,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","observation, should be instantly forgotten by him, and nothing live in"
8423,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his brain but the memory of what the ghost had told him, and enjoined"
8424,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",him to do. And Hamlet related the particulars of the conversation
8425,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",which had passed to none but his dear friend Horatio; and he enjoined
8426,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",both to him and Marcellus the strictest secrecy as to what they had
8427,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",seen that night.
8428,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8429,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",The terror which the sight of the ghost had left upon the senses of
8430,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Hamlet, he being weak and dispirited before, almost unhinged his"
8431,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","mind, and drove him beside his reason. And he, fearing that it would"
8432,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","continue to have this effect, which might subject him to observation,"
8433,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","and set his uncle upon his guard, if he suspected that he was"
8434,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","meditating any thing against him, or that Hamlet really knew more of"
8435,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his father's death than he professed, took up a strange resolution"
8436,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",from that time to counterfeit as if he were really and truly mad;
8437,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",thinking that he would be less an object of suspicion when his uncle
8438,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","should believe him incapable of any serious project, and that his real"
8439,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",perturbation of mind would be best covered and pass concealed under a
8440,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",disguise of pretended lunacy.
8441,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8442,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",From this time Hamlet affected a certain wildness and strangeness
8443,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","in his apparel, his speech, and behaviour, and did so excellently"
8444,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","counterfeit the madman, that the king and queen were both deceived,"
8445,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",and not thinking his grief for his father's death a sufficient cause
8446,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to produce such a distemper, for they knew not of the appearance of"
8447,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the ghost, they concluded that his malady was love, and they thought"
8448,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",they had found out the object.
8449,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8450,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Before Hamlet fell into the melancholy way which has been related, he"
8451,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","had dearly loved a fair maid called Ophelia, the daughter of Polonius,"
8452,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",the king's chief counsellor in affairs of state. He had sent her
8453,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","letters and rings, and made many tenders of his affection to her, and"
8454,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",importuned her with love in honourable fashion: and she had given
8455,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",belief to his vows and importunities. But the melancholy which he fell
8456,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","into latterly had made him neglect her, and from the time he conceived"
8457,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the project of counterfeiting madness, he affected to treat her with"
8458,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","unkindness, and a sort of rudeness; but she, good lady, rather than"
8459,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","reproach him with being false to her, persuaded herself that it was"
8460,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","nothing but the disease in his mind, and no settled unkindness, which"
8461,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",had made him less observant of her than formerly; and she compared the
8462,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","faculties of his once noble mind and excellent understanding, impaired"
8463,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","as they were with the deep melancholy that oppressed him, to sweet"
8464,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","bells which in themselves are capable of most exquisite music, but"
8465,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","when jangled out of tune, or rudely handled, produce only a harsh and"
8466,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",unpleasing sound.
8467,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8468,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Though the rough business which Hamlet had in hand, the revenging of"
8469,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his father's death upon his murderer, did not suit with the playful"
8470,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","state of courtship, or admit of the society of so idle a passion as"
8471,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","love now seemed to him, yet it could not hinder but that soft thoughts"
8472,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","of his Ophelia would come between, and in one of these moments,"
8473,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",when he thought that his treatment of this gentle lady had been
8474,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","unreasonably harsh, he wrote her a letter full of wild starts of"
8475,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","passion, and in extravagant terms, such as agreed with his supposed"
8476,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","madness, but mixed with some gentle touches of affection, which could"
8477,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",not but shew to this honoured lady that a deep love for her yet lay at
8478,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the bottom of his heart. He bade her to doubt the stars were fire, and"
8479,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to doubt that the sun did move, to doubt truth to be a liar, but never"
8480,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",to doubt that he loved; with more of such extravagant phrases. This
8481,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","letter Ophelia dutifully shewed to her father, and the old man thought"
8482,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","himself bound to communicate it to the king and queen, who from that"
8483,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",time supposed that the true cause of Hamlet's madness was love. And
8484,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",the queen wished that the good beauties of Ophelia might be the happy
8485,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","cause of his wildness, for so she hoped that her virtues might happily"
8486,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","restore him to his accustomed way again, to both their honours."
8487,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8488,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","But Hamlet's malady lay deeper than she supposed, or than could be"
8489,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","so cured. His father's ghost, which he had seen, still haunted his"
8490,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","imagination, and the sacred injunction to revenge his murder gave him"
8491,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",no rest till it was accomplished. Every hour of delay seemed to him a
8492,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","sin, and a violation of his father's commands. Yet how to compass the"
8493,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","death of the king, surrounded as he constantly was with his guards,"
8494,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","was no easy matter. Or if it had been, the presence of the queen,"
8495,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Hamlet's mother, who was generally with the king, was a restraint"
8496,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","upon his purpose, which he could not break through. Besides, the very"
8497,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",circumstance that the usurper was his mother's husband filled him with
8498,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","some remorse, and still blunted the edge of his purpose. The mere"
8499,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",act of putting a fellow-creature to death was in itself odious and
8500,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",terrible to a disposition naturally so gentle as Hamlet's was. His
8501,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","very melancholy, and the dejection of spirits he had so long been in,"
8502,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","produced an irresoluteness and wavering of purpose, which kept him"
8503,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","from proceeding to extremities. Moreover, he could not help having"
8504,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","some scruples upon his mind, whether the spirit which he had seen"
8505,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","was indeed his father, or whether it might not be the devil, who he"
8506,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","had heard has power to take any form he pleases, and who might have"
8507,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",assumed his father's shape only to take advantage of his weakness and
8508,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his melancholy, to drive him to the doing of so desperate an act as"
8509,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",murder. And he determined that he would have more certain grounds to
8510,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","go upon than a vision, or apparition, which might be a delusion."
8511,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8512,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","While he was in this irresolute mind, there came to the court"
8513,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","certain players, in whom Hamlet formerly used to take delight, and"
8514,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","particularly to hear one of them speak a tragical speech, describing"
8515,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the death of old Priam, king of Troy, with the grief of Hecuba, his"
8516,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","queen. Hamlet welcomed his old friends, the players, and remembering"
8517,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","how that speech had formerly given him pleasure, requested the player"
8518,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to repeat it; which he did in so lively a manner, setting forth the"
8519,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","cruel murder of the feeble old king, with the destruction of his"
8520,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","people and city by fire, and the mad grief of the old queen, running"
8521,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","barefoot up and down the palace, with a poor clout upon that head"
8522,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","where a crown had been, and with nothing but a blanket upon her loins,"
8523,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","snatched up in haste, where she had worn a royal robe: that not only"
8524,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","it drew tears from all that stood by, who thought they saw the real"
8525,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","scene, so livelily was it represented, but even the player himself"
8526,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",delivered it with a broken voice and real tears. This put Hamlet upon
8527,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","thinking, if that player could so work himself up to passion by a mere"
8528,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","fictitious speech, to weep for one that he had never seen, for Hecuba,"
8529,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","that had been dead so many hundred years, how dull was he, who having"
8530,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","a real motive and cue for passion, a real king and a dear father"
8531,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","murdered, was yet so little moved, that his revenge all this while had"
8532,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",seemed to have slept in dull and muddy forgetfulness! And while he
8533,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","meditated on actors and acting, and the powerful effects which a good"
8534,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","play, represented to the life, has upon the spectator, he remembered"
8535,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the instance of some murderer, who seeing a murder on the stage,"
8536,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",was by the mere force of the scene and resemblance of circumstances
8537,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","so affected, that on the spot he confessed the crime which he had"
8538,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",committed. And he determined that these players should play something
8539,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","like the murder of his father before his uncle, and he would watch"
8540,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","narrowly what effect it might have upon him, and from his looks he"
8541,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",would be able to gather with more certainty if he were the murderer
8542,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","or not. To this effect he ordered a play to be prepared, to the"
8543,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",representation of which he invited the king and queen.
8544,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8545,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",The story of the play was of a murder done in Vienna upon a duke. The
8546,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","duke's name was Gonzago, his wife Baptista. The play shewed how one"
8547,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Lucianus, a near relation to the duke, poisoned him in his garden for"
8548,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his estate, and how the murderer in a short time after got the love of"
8549,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",Gonzago's wife.
8550,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8551,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","At the representation of this play the king, who did not know the trap"
8552,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","which was laid for him, was present, with his queen and the whole"
8553,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",court: Hamlet sitting attentively near him to observe his looks. The
8554,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","play began with a conversation between Gonzago and his wife, in which"
8555,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the lady made many protestations of love, and of never marrying a"
8556,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","second husband, if she should outlive Gonzago; wishing she might be"
8557,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","accursed if she ever took a second husband, and adding that no woman"
8558,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",ever did so but those wicked women who kill their first husbands.
8559,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Hamlet observed the king, his uncle, change colour at this expression,"
8560,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",and that it was as bad as wormwood both to him and to the queen. But
8561,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","when Lucianus, according to the story, came to poison Gonzago sleeping"
8562,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","in the garden, the strong resemblance which it bore to his own wicked"
8563,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","act upon the late king, his brother, whom he had poisoned in his"
8564,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","garden, so struck upon the conscience of this usurper, that he was"
8565,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","unable to sit out the rest of the play, but on a sudden calling for"
8566,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","lights to his chamber, and affecting or partly feeling a sudden"
8567,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","sickness, he abruptly left the theatre. The king being departed the"
8568,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",play was given over. Now Hamlet had seen enough to be satisfied that
8569,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the words of the ghost were true, and no illusion; and in a fit of"
8570,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","gaiety, like that which comes over a man who suddenly has some great"
8571,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","doubt or scruple resolved, he swore to Horatio that he would take the"
8572,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",ghost's word for a thousand pounds. But before he could make up his
8573,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","resolution as to what measures of revenge he should take, now he was"
8574,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","certainly informed that his uncle was his father's murderer, he was"
8575,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","sent for by the queen, his mother, to a private conference in her"
8576,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",closet.
8577,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8578,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","It was by desire of the king that the queen sent for Hamlet, that she"
8579,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",might signify to her son how much his late behaviour had displeased
8580,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","them both; and the king, wishing to know all that passed at that"
8581,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","conference, and thinking that the too partial report of a mother might"
8582,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","let slip some part of Hamlet's words, which it might much import the"
8583,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","king to know, Polonius, the old counsellor of state, was ordered to"
8584,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","plant himself behind the hangings in the queen's closet, where he"
8585,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",might unseen hear all that passed. This artifice was particularly
8586,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","adapted to the disposition of Polonius, who was a man grown old in"
8587,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","crooked maxims and policies of state, and delighted to get at the"
8588,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",knowledge of matters in an indirect and cunning way.
8589,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8590,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Hamlet being come to his mother, she began to tax him in the roundest"
8591,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","way with his actions and behaviour, and she told him that he had given"
8592,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","great offence to _his father_, meaning the king, his uncle, whom,"
8593,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","because he had married her, she called Hamlet's father. Hamlet, sorely"
8594,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",indignant that she should give so dear and honoured a name as father
8595,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","seemed to him, to a wretch who was indeed no better than the murderer"
8596,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","of his true father, with some sharpness replied, ""Mother, _you_ have"
8597,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","much offended _my father_."" The queen said that was but an idle"
8598,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","answer. ""As good as the question deserved,"" said Hamlet. The queen"
8599,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","asked him if he had forgotten who it was he was speaking to? ""Alas!"""
8600,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","replied Hamlet, ""I wish I could forget. You are the queen, your"
8601,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",husband's brother's wife; and you are my mother: I wish you were not
8602,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","what you are."" ""Nay, then,"" said the queen, ""if you shew me so little"
8603,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","respect, I will set those to you that can speak,"" and was going to"
8604,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","send the king or Polonius to him. But Hamlet would not let her go, now"
8605,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","he had her alone, till he had tried if his words could not bring her"
8606,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to some sense of her wicked life; and, taking her by the wrist, he"
8607,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","held her fast, and made her sit down. She, affrighted at his earnest"
8608,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","manner, and fearful lest in his lunacy he should do her a mischief,"
8609,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","cried out: and a voice was heard from behind the hangings, ""Help, help"
8610,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the queen;"" which Hamlet hearing, and verily thinking that it was the"
8611,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","king himself there concealed, he drew his sword, and stabbed at the"
8612,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","place where the voice came from, as he would have stabbed a rat that"
8613,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","ran there, till the voice ceasing, he concluded the person to be dead."
8614,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","But when he dragged forth the body, it was not the king, but Polonius,"
8615,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the old officious counsellor, that had planted himself as a spy behind"
8616,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the hangings. ""Oh me!"" exclaimed the queen, ""what a rash and bloody"
8617,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","deed have you done!"" ""A bloody deed, mother,"" replied Hamlet, ""but not"
8618,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","so bad as yours, who killed a king, and married his brother."" Hamlet"
8619,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",had gone too far to leave off here. He was now in the humour to speak
8620,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","plainly to his mother, and he pursued it. And though the faults of"
8621,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","parents are to be tenderly treated by their children, yet in the case"
8622,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",of great crimes the son may have leave to speak even to his own mother
8623,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","with some harshness, so as that harshness is meant for her good, and"
8624,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to turn her from her wicked ways, and not done for the purpose of"
8625,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",upbraiding. And now this virtuous prince did in moving terms represent
8626,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to the queen the heinousness of her offence, in being so forgetful of"
8627,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the dead king, his father, as in so short a space of time to marry"
8628,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","with his brother and reputed murderer: such an act as, after the vows"
8629,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","which she had sworn to her first husband, was enough to make all vows"
8630,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","of women suspected, and all virtue to be accounted hypocrisy, wedding"
8631,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","contracts to be less than gamesters' oaths, and religion to be a"
8632,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","mockery and a mere form of words. He said she had done such a deed,"
8633,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","that the heavens blushed at it, and the earth was sick of her because"
8634,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","of it. And he shewed her two pictures, the one of the late king, her"
8635,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","first husband, and the other of the present king, her second husband,"
8636,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",and he bade her mark the difference: what a grace was on the brow
8637,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","of his father, how like a god he looked! the curls of Apollo, the"
8638,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","forehead of Jupiter, the eye of Mars, and a posture like to Mercury"
8639,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","newly alighted on some heaven-kissing hill! this man, he said, _had"
8640,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",been_ her husband. And then he shewed her whom she had got in his
8641,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","stead: how like a blight or a mildew he looked, for so he had blasted"
8642,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",his wholesome brother. And the queen was sore ashamed that he should
8643,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","so turn her eyes inward upon her soul, which she now saw so black and"
8644,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",deformed. And he asked her how she could continue to live with this
8645,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","man, and be a wife to him, who had murdered her first husband, and"
8646,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","got the crown by as false means as a thief--And just as he spoke, the"
8647,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","ghost of his father, such as he was in his lifetime, and such as he"
8648,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","had lately seen it, entered the room, and Hamlet, in great terror,"
8649,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",asked what it would have; and the ghost said that it came to remind
8650,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","him of the revenge he had promised, which Hamlet seemed to have"
8651,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","forgot: and the ghost bade him speak to his mother, for the grief and"
8652,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","terror she was in would else kill her. It then vanished, and was seen"
8653,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","by none but Hamlet, neither could he by pointing to where it stood,"
8654,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","or by any description, make his mother perceive it; who was terribly"
8655,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","frighted all this while to hear him conversing, as it seemed to her,"
8656,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",with nothing: and she imputed it to the disorder of his mind. But
8657,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",Hamlet begged her not to flatter her wicked soul in such a manner as
8658,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to think that it was his madness, and not her own offences, which had"
8659,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",brought his father's spirit again on the earth. And he bade her feel
8660,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his pulse, how temperately it beat, not like a madman's. And he begged"
8661,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","of her with tears, to confess herself to heaven for what was past,"
8662,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","and for the future to avoid the company of the king, and be no more"
8663,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","as a wife to him: and when she should shew herself a mother to him,"
8664,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","by respecting his father's memory, he would ask a blessing of her as"
8665,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","a son. And she promising to observe his directions, the conference"
8666,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",ended.
8667,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8668,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",And now Hamlet was at leisure to consider who it was that in his
8669,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",unfortunate rashness he had killed: and when he came to see that it
8670,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","was Polonius, the father of the lady Ophelia, whom he so dearly loved,"
8671,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","he drew apart the dead body, and, his spirits being now a little"
8672,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","quieter, he wept for what he had done."
8673,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8674,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",The unfortunate death of Polonius gave the king a pretence for sending
8675,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Hamlet out of the kingdom. He would willingly have put him to death,"
8676,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","fearing him as dangerous; but he dreaded the people, who loved Hamlet;"
8677,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","and the queen, who, with all her faults, doted upon the prince, her"
8678,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","son. So this subtle king, under pretence of providing for Hamlet's"
8679,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","safety, that he might not be called to account for Polonius' death,"
8680,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","caused him to be conveyed on board a ship bound for England, under the"
8681,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","care of two courtiers, by whom he dispatched letters to the English"
8682,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","court, which at that time was in subjection and paid tribute to"
8683,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Denmark, requiring for special reasons there pretended, that Hamlet"
8684,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","should be put to death as soon as he landed on English ground. Hamlet,"
8685,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","suspecting some treachery, in the night-time secretly got at the"
8686,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","letters, and skilfully erasing his own name, he in the stead of it"
8687,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","put in the names of those two courtiers, who had the charge of him,"
8688,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to be put to death: then sealing up the letters, he put them into"
8689,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","their place again. Soon after the ship was attacked by pirates, and a"
8690,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","sea-fight commenced; in the course of which Hamlet, desirous to shew"
8691,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his valour, with sword in hand singly boarded the enemy's vessel;"
8692,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","while his own ship, in a cowardly manner, bore away, and leaving him"
8693,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to his fate, the two courtiers made the best of their way to England,"
8694,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",charged with those letters the sense of which Hamlet had altered to
8695,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",their own deserved destruction.
8696,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8697,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","The pirates, who had the prince in their power, shewed themselves"
8698,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","gentle enemies; and knowing whom they had got prisoner, in the hope"
8699,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",that the prince might do them a good turn at court in recompence
8700,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","for any favour they might shew him, they set Hamlet on shore at the"
8701,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","nearest port in Denmark. From that place Hamlet wrote to the king,"
8702,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",acquainting him with the strange chance which had brought him back to
8703,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his own country, and saying that on the next day he should present"
8704,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","himself before his majesty. When he got home, a sad spectacle offered"
8705,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",itself the first thing to his eyes.
8706,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8707,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","This was the funeral of the young and beautiful Ophelia, his once dear"
8708,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",mistress. The wits of this young lady had begun to turn ever since
8709,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","her poor father's death. That he should die a violent death, and by"
8710,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the hands of the prince whom she loved, so affected this tender young"
8711,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","maid, that in a little time she grew perfectly distracted, and would"
8712,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","go about giving flowers away to the ladies of the court, and saying"
8713,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","that they were for her father's burial, singing songs about love and"
8714,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","about death, and sometimes such as had no meaning at all, as if she"
8715,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",had no memory of what had happened to her. There was a willow which
8716,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","grew slanting over a brook, and reflected its leaves in the stream. To"
8717,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","this brook she came one day when she was unwatched, with garlands she"
8718,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","had been making, mixed up of daisies and nettles, flowers and weeds"
8719,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","together, and clambering up to hang her garland upon the boughs of the"
8720,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","willow, a bow broke and precipitated this fair young maid, garland,"
8721,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","and all that she had gathered, into the water, where her clothes bore"
8722,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","her up for a while, during which she chaunted scraps of old tunes,"
8723,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","like one insensible to her own distress, or as if she were a creature"
8724,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","natural to that element: but long it was not before her garments,"
8725,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","heavy with the wet, pulled her in from her melodious singing to a"
8726,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",muddy and miserable death. It was the funeral of this fair maid which
8727,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","her brother Laertes was celebrating, the king and queen and whole"
8728,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","court being present, when Hamlet arrived. He knew not what all this"
8729,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","shew imported, but stood on one side, not inclining to interrupt the"
8730,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","ceremony. He saw the flowers strewed upon her grave, as the custom was"
8731,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","in maiden burials, which the queen herself threw in; and as she threw"
8732,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","them, she said, ""Sweets to the sweet! I thought to have decked thy"
8733,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","bride-bed, sweet maid, not to have strewed thy grave. Thou shouldst"
8734,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","have been my Hamlet's wife."" And he heard her brother wish that"
8735,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",violets might spring from her grave: and he saw him leap into the
8736,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","grave all frantic with grief, and bid the attendants pile mountains"
8737,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","of earth upon him, that he might be buried with her. And Hamlet's love"
8738,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","for this fair maid came back to him, and he could not bear that a"
8739,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","brother should shew so much transport of grief, for he thought that he"
8740,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",loved Ophelia better than forty thousand brothers. Then discovering
8741,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","himself, he leaped into the grave where Laertes was, all as frantic or"
8742,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","more frantic than he, and Laertes knowing him to be Hamlet, who had"
8743,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","been the cause of his father's and his sister's death, grappled him by"
8744,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the throat as an enemy, till the attendants parted them: and Hamlet,"
8745,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","after the funeral, excused his hasty act in throwing himself into"
8746,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",the grave as if to brave Laertes; but he said he could not bear that
8747,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",any one should seem to outgo him in grief for the death of the fair
8748,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",Ophelia. And for the time these two noble youths seemed reconciled.
8749,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",
8750,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",But out of the grief and anger of Laertes for the death of his
8751,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","father and Ophelia, the king, Hamlet's wicked uncle, contrived"
8752,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","destruction for Hamlet. He set on Laertes, under cover of peace and"
8753,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","reconciliation, to challenge Hamlet to a friendly trial of skill at"
8754,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","fencing, which Hamlet accepting, a day was appointed to try the match."
8755,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","At this match all the court was present, and Laertes, by direction of"
8756,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the king, prepared a poisoned weapon. Upon this match great wagers"
8757,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","were laid by the courtiers, as both Hamlet and Laertes were known to"
8758,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","excel at this sword-play; and Hamlet taking up the foils chose one,"
8759,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","not at all suspecting the treachery of Laertes, or being careful to"
8760,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","examine Laertes' weapon, who, instead of a foil or blunted sword,"
8761,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","which the laws of fencing require, made use of one with a point, and"
8762,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","poisoned. At first Laertes did but play with Hamlet, and suffered him"
8763,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to gain some advantages, which the dissembling king magnified and"
8764,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","extolled beyond measure, drinking to Hamlet's success, and wagering"
8765,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","rich bets upon the issue: but after a few passes, Laertes growing"
8766,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","warm made a deadly thrust at Hamlet with his poisoned weapon, and"
8767,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","gave him a mortal blow. Hamlet incensed, but not knowing the whole of"
8768,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the treachery, in the scuffle exchanged his own innocent weapon for"
8769,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Laertes' deadly one, and with a thrust of Laertes' own sword repaid"
8770,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Laertes home, who was thus justly caught in his own treachery. In"
8771,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",this instant the queen shrieked out that she was poisoned. She had
8772,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",inadvertently drunk out of a bowl which the king had prepared for
8773,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","Hamlet, in case that being warm in fencing he should call for drink:"
8774,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","into this the treacherous king had infused a deadly poison, to make"
8775,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","sure of Hamlet, if Laertes had failed. He had forgotten to warn"
8776,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the queen of the bowl, which she drank of, and immediately died,"
8777,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","exclaiming with her last breath that she was poisoned. Hamlet,"
8778,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","suspecting some treachery, ordered the doors to be shut, while he"
8779,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","sought it out. Laertes told him to seek no further, for he was the"
8780,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",traitor; and feeling his life go away with the wound which Hamlet had
8781,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","given him, he made confession of the treachery he had used, and how he"
8782,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","had fallen a victim to it: and he told Hamlet of the envenomed point,"
8783,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","and said that Hamlet had not half an hour to live, for no medicine"
8784,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","could cure him; and begging forgiveness of Hamlet he died, with his"
8785,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",last words accusing the king of being the contriver of the mischief.
8786,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","When Hamlet saw his end draw near, there being yet some venom left"
8787,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","upon the sword, he suddenly turned upon his false uncle, and thrust"
8788,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the point of it to his heart, fulfilling the promise which he had made"
8789,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","to his father's spirit, whose injunction was now accomplished, and"
8790,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","his foul murder revenged upon the murderer. Then Hamlet, feeling his"
8791,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","breath fail and life departing, turned to his dear friend Horatio, who"
8792,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",had been spectator of this fatal tragedy; and with his dying breath
8793,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",requested him that he would live to tell his story to the world (for
8794,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",Horatio had made a motion as if he would slay himself to accompany
8795,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","the prince in death), and Horatio promised that he would make a true"
8796,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","report, as one that was privy to all the circumstances. And, thus"
8797,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","satisfied, the noble heart of Hamlet cracked: and Horatio and the"
8798,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",bystanders with many tears commended the spirit of their sweet prince
8799,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",to the guardianship of angels. For Hamlet was a loving and a gentle
8800,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","prince, and greatly beloved for his many noble and prince-like"
8801,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK","qualities; and if he had lived, would no doubt have proved a most"
8802,"HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK",royal and complete king to Denmark.

8809,OTHELLO,(_By Charles Lamb_)
8810,OTHELLO,
8811,OTHELLO,
8812,OTHELLO,"Brabantio, the rich senator of Venice, had a fair daughter, the gentle"
8813,OTHELLO,"Desdemona. She was sought to by divers suitors, both on account of"
8814,OTHELLO,her many virtuous qualities and for her rich expectations. But among
8815,OTHELLO,the suitors of her own clime and complexion she saw none whom she
8816,OTHELLO,"could affect: for this noble lady, who regarded the mind more than"
8817,OTHELLO,"the features of men, with a singularity rather to be admired than"
8818,OTHELLO,"imitated, had chosen for the object of her affections a Moor, a black,"
8819,OTHELLO,"whom her father loved, and often invited to his house."
8820,OTHELLO,
8821,OTHELLO,Neither is Desdemona to be altogether condemned for the unsuitableness
8822,OTHELLO,of the person whom she selected for her lover. Bating that Othello was
8823,OTHELLO,"black, the noble Moor wanted nothing which might recommend him to the"
8824,OTHELLO,"affections of the greatest lady. He was a soldier, and a brave one;"
8825,OTHELLO,"and by his conduct in bloody wars against the Turks, had risen to the"
8826,OTHELLO,"rank of general in the Venetian service, and was esteemed and trusted"
8827,OTHELLO,by the state.
8828,OTHELLO,
8829,OTHELLO,"He had been a traveller, and Desdemona (as is the manner of ladies)"
8830,OTHELLO,"loved to hear him tell the story of his adventures, which he would"
8831,OTHELLO,"run through from his earliest recollection; the battles, sieges, and"
8832,OTHELLO,"encounters, which he had past through; the perils he had been exposed"
8833,OTHELLO,"to by land and by water; his hair-breadth escapes, when he has entered"
8834,OTHELLO,"a breach, or marched up to the mouth of a cannon; and how he had"
8835,OTHELLO,"been taken prisoner by the insolent enemy, and sold to slavery: how"
8836,OTHELLO,"he demeaned himself in that state, and how he escaped: all these"
8837,OTHELLO,"accounts, added to the narration of the strange things he had seen in"
8838,OTHELLO,"foreign countries, the vast wildernesses and romantic caverns, the"
8839,OTHELLO,"quarries, the rocks and mountains, whose heads are in the clouds; of"
8840,OTHELLO,"the savage nations, the cannibals who are man-eaters, and a race of"
8841,OTHELLO,people in Africa whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders: these
8842,OTHELLO,"travellers' stories would so enchain the attention of Desdemona, that"
8843,OTHELLO,"if she were called off at any time by household affairs, she would"
8844,OTHELLO,"dispatch with all haste that business, and return, and with a greedy"
8845,OTHELLO,ear devour Othello's discourse. And once he took advantage of a pliant
8846,OTHELLO,"hour, and drew from her a prayer, that he would tell her the whole"
8847,OTHELLO,"story of his life at large, of which she had heard so much, but only"
8848,OTHELLO,"by parts: to which he consented, and beguiled her of many a tear, when"
8849,OTHELLO,he spoke of some distressful stroke which his youth suffered.
8850,OTHELLO,
8851,OTHELLO,"His story being done, she gave him for his pains a world of sighs: she"
8852,OTHELLO,"swore a pretty oath, that it was all passing strange, and pitiful,"
8853,OTHELLO,"wondrous pitiful: she wished (she said) she had not heard it, yet she"
8854,OTHELLO,"wished that heaven had made her such a man: and then she thanked him,"
8855,OTHELLO,"and told him, if he had a friend who loved her, he had only to teach"
8856,OTHELLO,"him how to tell his story, and that would woo her. Upon this hint,"
8857,OTHELLO,"delivered not with more frankness than modesty, accompanied with a"
8858,OTHELLO,"certain bewitching prettiness, and blushes, which Othello could not"
8859,OTHELLO,"but understand, he spoke more openly of his love, and in this golden"
8860,OTHELLO,opportunity gained the consent of the generous lady Desdemona
8861,OTHELLO,privately to marry him.
8862,OTHELLO,
8863,OTHELLO,"Neither Othello's colour nor his fortune were such, that it could be"
8864,OTHELLO,hoped Brabantio would accept him for a son-in-law. He had left his
8865,OTHELLO,"daughter free; but he did expect that, as the manner of noble Venetian"
8866,OTHELLO,"ladies was, she would choose ere long a husband of senatorial rank or"
8867,OTHELLO,"expectations: but in this he was deceived; Desdemona loved the Moor,"
8868,OTHELLO,"though he was black, and devoted her heart and fortunes to his valiant"
8869,OTHELLO,parts and qualities: so was her heart subdued to an implicit devotion
8870,OTHELLO,"to the man she had selected for a husband, that his very colour, which"
8871,OTHELLO,to all but this discerning lady would have proved an insurmountable
8872,OTHELLO,"objection, was by her esteemed above all the white skins and clear"
8873,OTHELLO,"complexions of the young Venetian nobility, her suitors."
8874,OTHELLO,
8875,OTHELLO,"Their marriage, which, though privately carried, could not long"
8876,OTHELLO,"be kept a secret, came to the ears of the old man, Brabantio, who"
8877,OTHELLO,"appeared in a solemn council of the senate, as an accuser of the Moor"
8878,OTHELLO,"Othello, who by spells and witchcraft (he maintained) had seduced the"
8879,OTHELLO,"affections of the fair Desdemona to marry him, without the consent of"
8880,OTHELLO,"her father, and against the obligations of hospitality."
8881,OTHELLO,
8882,OTHELLO,At this juncture of time it happened that the state of Venice had
8883,OTHELLO,"immediate need of the services of Othello, news having arrived that"
8884,OTHELLO,"the Turks with mighty preparation had fitted out a fleet, which was"
8885,OTHELLO,"bending its course to the island of Cyprus, with intent to regain that"
8886,OTHELLO,"strong post from the Venetians, who then held it: in this emergency"
8887,OTHELLO,"the state turned its eyes upon Othello, who alone was deemed adequate"
8888,OTHELLO,"to conduct the defence of Cyprus against the Turks. So that Othello,"
8889,OTHELLO,"now summoned before the senate, stood in their presence at once as a"
8890,OTHELLO,"candidate for a great state-employment, and as a culprit, charged with"
8891,OTHELLO,offences which by the laws of Venice were made capital.
8892,OTHELLO,
8893,OTHELLO,The age and senatorial character of old Brabantio commanded a most
8894,OTHELLO,patient hearing from that grave assembly; but the incensed father
8895,OTHELLO,"conducted his accusation with so much intemperance, producing"
8896,OTHELLO,"likelihoods and allegations for proofs, that, when Othello was called"
8897,OTHELLO,"upon for his defence, he had only to relate a plain tale of the course"
8898,OTHELLO,"of his love; which he did with such an artless eloquence, recounting"
8899,OTHELLO,"the whole story of his wooing, as we have related it above, and"
8900,OTHELLO,delivered his speech with so noble a plainness (the evidence of
8901,OTHELLO,"truth), that the duke, who sat as chief judge, could not help"
8902,OTHELLO,"confessing, that a tale so told would have won his daughter too: and"
8903,OTHELLO,"the spells and conjurations, which Othello had used in his courtship,"
8904,OTHELLO,plainly appeared to have been no more than the honest arts of men in
8905,OTHELLO,love; and the only witchcraft which he had used the faculty of telling
8906,OTHELLO,a soft tale to win a lady's ear.
8907,OTHELLO,
8908,OTHELLO,This statement of Othello was confirmed by the testimony of the lady
8909,OTHELLO,"Desdemona herself, who appeared in court, and professing a duty to her"
8910,OTHELLO,"father for life and education, challenged leave of him to profess a"
8911,OTHELLO,"yet higher duty to her lord and husband, even so much as her mother"
8912,OTHELLO,had shewn in preferring him (Brabantio) above _her_ father.
8913,OTHELLO,
8914,OTHELLO,"The old senator, unable to maintain his plea, called the Moor to him"
8915,OTHELLO,"with many expressions of sorrow, and, as an act of necessity, bestowed"
8916,OTHELLO,"upon him his daughter, whom, if he had been free to withhold her, (he"
8917,OTHELLO,"told him) he would with all his heart have kept from him; adding, that"
8918,OTHELLO,"he was glad at soul that he had no other child, for this behaviour of"
8919,OTHELLO,"Desdemona would have taught him to be a tyrant, and hang clogs on them"
8920,OTHELLO,for her desertion.
8921,OTHELLO,
8922,OTHELLO,"This difficulty being got over, Othello, to whom custom had rendered"
8923,OTHELLO,the hardships of a military life as natural as food and rest are to
8924,OTHELLO,"other men, readily undertook the management of the wars in Cyprus:"
8925,OTHELLO,"and Desdemona, preferring the honour of her lord (though with danger)"
8926,OTHELLO,before the indulgence of those idle delights in which new-married
8927,OTHELLO,"people usually waste their time, cheerfully consented to his going."
8928,OTHELLO,
8929,OTHELLO,"No sooner were Othello and his lady landed in Cyprus, than news"
8930,OTHELLO,"arrived, that a desperate tempest had dispersed the Turkish fleet,"
8931,OTHELLO,and thus the island was secure from any immediate apprehension of an
8932,OTHELLO,"attack. But the war, which Othello was to suffer, was now beginning;"
8933,OTHELLO,"and the enemies, which malice stirred up against his innocent lady,"
8934,OTHELLO,proved in their nature more deadly than strangers or infidels.
8935,OTHELLO,
8936,OTHELLO,Among all the general's friends no one possessed the confidence of
8937,OTHELLO,"Othello more entirely than Cassio. Michael Cassio was a young soldier,"
8938,OTHELLO,"a Florentine, gay, amorous, and of pleasing address, favourite"
8939,OTHELLO,"qualities with women; he was handsome, and eloquent, and exactly such"
8940,OTHELLO,a person as might alarm the jealousy of a man advanced in years (as
8941,OTHELLO,"Othello in some measure was), who had married a young and beautiful"
8942,OTHELLO,"wife; but Othello was as free from jealousy as he was noble, and as"
8943,OTHELLO,"incapable of suspecting, as of doing, a base action. He had employed"
8944,OTHELLO,"this Cassio in his love-affair with Desdemona, and Cassio had been a"
8945,OTHELLO,"sort of go-between in his suit: for Othello, fearing that himself had"
8946,OTHELLO,"not those soft parts of conversation which please ladies, and finding"
8947,OTHELLO,"these qualities in his friend, would often depute Cassio to go (as he"
8948,OTHELLO,phrased it) a courting for him: such innocent simplicity being rather
8949,OTHELLO,an honour than a blemish to the character of the valiant Moor. So that
8950,OTHELLO,"no wonder, if next to Othello himself (but at far distance, as beseems"
8951,OTHELLO,a virtuous wife) the gentle Desdemona loved and trusted Cassio. Nor
8952,OTHELLO,had the marriage of this couple made any difference in their behaviour
8953,OTHELLO,"to Michael Cassio. He frequented their house, and his free and"
8954,OTHELLO,"rattling talk was no unpleasing variety to Othello, who was himself of"
8955,OTHELLO,a more serious temper: for such tempers are observed often to delight
8956,OTHELLO,"in their contraries, as a relief from the oppressive excess of their"
8957,OTHELLO,"own: and Desdemona and Cassio would talk and laugh together, as in the"
8958,OTHELLO,days when he went a courting for his friend.
8959,OTHELLO,
8960,OTHELLO,"Othello had lately promoted Cassio to be the lieutenant, a place of"
8961,OTHELLO,"trust, and nearest to the general's person. This promotion gave great"
8962,OTHELLO,"offence to Iago, an older officer, who thought he had a better claim"
8963,OTHELLO,"than Cassio, and would often ridicule Cassio, as a fellow fit only for"
8964,OTHELLO,"the company of ladies, and one that knew no more of the art of war,"
8965,OTHELLO,"or how to set an army in array for battle, than a girl. Iago hated"
8966,OTHELLO,"Cassio, and he hated Othello, as well for favouring Cassio, as for an"
8967,OTHELLO,"unjust suspicion, which he had lightly taken up against Othello, that"
8968,OTHELLO,the Moor was too fond of Iago's wife Emilia. From these imaginary
8969,OTHELLO,"provocations, the plotting mind of Iago conceived a horrid scheme of"
8970,OTHELLO,"revenge, which should involve both Cassio, the Moor, and Desdemona in"
8971,OTHELLO,one common ruin.
8972,OTHELLO,
8973,OTHELLO,"Iago was artful, and had studied human nature deeply, and he knew that"
8974,OTHELLO,of all the torments which afflict the mind of man (and far beyond
8975,OTHELLO,"bodily torture), the pains of jealousy were the most intolerable, and"
8976,OTHELLO,had the sorest sting. If he could succeed in making Othello jealous of
8977,OTHELLO,"Cassio, he thought it would be an exquisite plot of revenge, and might"
8978,OTHELLO,"end in the death of Cassio or Othello, or both; he cared not."
8979,OTHELLO,
8980,OTHELLO,"The arrival of the general and his lady in Cyprus, meeting with the"
8981,OTHELLO,"news of the dispersion of the enemy's fleet, made a sort of holiday"
8982,OTHELLO,in the island. Every body gave themselves up to feasting and making
8983,OTHELLO,"merry. Wine flowed in abundance, and cups went round to the health of"
8984,OTHELLO,"the black Othello, and his lady the fair Desdemona."
8985,OTHELLO,
8986,OTHELLO,"Cassio had the direction of the guard that night, with a charge from"
8987,OTHELLO,"Othello to keep the soldiers from excess in drinking, that no brawl"
8988,OTHELLO,"might arise, to fright the inhabitants, or disgust them with the"
8989,OTHELLO,new-landed forces. That night Iago began his deep-laid plans of
8990,OTHELLO,"mischief; under cover of loyalty and love to the general, he enticed"
8991,OTHELLO,Cassio to make rather too free with the bottle (a great fault in an
8992,OTHELLO,"officer upon guard). Cassio for a time resisted, but he could not long"
8993,OTHELLO,"hold out against the honest freedom which Iago knew how to put on, but"
8994,OTHELLO,kept swallowing glass after glass (as Iago still plied him with drink
8995,OTHELLO,"and encouraging songs), and Cassio's tongue ran over in praise of the"
8996,OTHELLO,"lady Desdemona, whom he again and again toasted, affirming that she"
8997,OTHELLO,was a most exquisite lady: until at last the enemy which he put into
8998,OTHELLO,"his mouth, stole away his brains; and upon some provocation given him"
8999,OTHELLO,"by a fellow whom Iago had set on, swords were drawn, and Montano, a"
9000,OTHELLO,"worthy officer, who interfered to appease the dispute, was wounded in"
9001,OTHELLO,"the scuffle. The riot now began to be general, and Iago, who had set"
9002,OTHELLO,"on foot the mischief, was foremost in spreading the alarm, causing"
9003,OTHELLO,the castle-bell to be rung (as if some dangerous mutiny instead of a
9004,OTHELLO,slight drunken quarrel had arisen): the alarm-bell ringing awakened
9005,OTHELLO,"Othello, who, dressing in a hurry, and coming to the scene of action,"
9006,OTHELLO,"questioned Cassio of the cause. Cassio was now come to himself, the"
9007,OTHELLO,"effect of the wine having a little gone off, but was too much ashamed"
9008,OTHELLO,"to reply; and Iago, pretending a great reluctance to accuse Cassio,"
9009,OTHELLO,"but as it were forced into it by Othello, who insisted to know the"
9010,OTHELLO,"truth, gave an account of the whole matter (leaving out his own share"
9011,OTHELLO,"in it, which Cassio was too far gone to remember) in such a manner,"
9012,OTHELLO,"as while he seemed to make Cassio's offence less, did indeed make it"
9013,OTHELLO,"appear greater than it was. The result was, that Othello, who was a"
9014,OTHELLO,"strict observer of discipline, was compelled to take away Cassio's"
9015,OTHELLO,place of lieutenant from him.
9016,OTHELLO,
9017,OTHELLO,Thus did Iago's first artifice succeed completely; he had now
9018,OTHELLO,"undermined his hated rival, and thrust him out of his place: but"
9019,OTHELLO,a further use was hereafter to be made of the adventure of this
9020,OTHELLO,disastrous night.
9021,OTHELLO,
9022,OTHELLO,"Cassio, whom this misfortune had entirely sobered, now lamented to"
9023,OTHELLO,his seeming friend Iago that he should have been such a fool as to
9024,OTHELLO,"transform himself into a beast. He was undone, for how could he ask"
9025,OTHELLO,the general for his place again! he would tell him he was a drunkard.
9026,OTHELLO,"He despised himself. Iago, affecting to make light of it, said, that"
9027,OTHELLO,"he, or any man living, might be drunk upon occasion; it remained now"
9028,OTHELLO,to make the best of a bad bargain; the general's wife was now the
9029,OTHELLO,"general, and could do any thing with Othello; that he were best to"
9030,OTHELLO,apply to the lady Desdemona to mediate for him with her lord; that she
9031,OTHELLO,"was of a frank, obliging disposition, and would readily undertake a"
9032,OTHELLO,"good office of this sort, and set Cassio right again in the general's"
9033,OTHELLO,favour; and then this crack in their love would be made stronger than
9034,OTHELLO,"ever. A good advice of Iago, if it had not been given for wicked"
9035,OTHELLO,"purposes, which will after appear."
9036,OTHELLO,
9037,OTHELLO,"Cassio did as Iago advised him, and made application to the lady"
9038,OTHELLO,"Desdemona, who was easy to be won over in any honest suit; and she"
9039,OTHELLO,"promised Cassio that she would be his solicitor with her lord, and"
9040,OTHELLO,rather die than give up his cause. This she immediately set about
9041,OTHELLO,"in so earnest and pretty a manner, that Othello, who was mortally"
9042,OTHELLO,"offended with Cassio, could not put her off. When he pleaded delay,"
9043,OTHELLO,"and that it was too soon to pardon such an offender, she would not"
9044,OTHELLO,"be beat back, but insisted that it should be the next night, or the"
9045,OTHELLO,"morning after, or the next morning to that at farthest. Then she"
9046,OTHELLO,"shewed how penitent and humbled poor Cassio was, and that his offence"
9047,OTHELLO,"did not deserve so sharp a check. And when Othello still hung back,"
9048,OTHELLO,"""What! my lord,"" said she, ""that I should have so much to do to"
9049,OTHELLO,"plead for Cassio, Michael Cassio, that came a courting for you, and"
9050,OTHELLO,"oftentimes, when I have spoken in dispraise of you, has taken your"
9051,OTHELLO,part! I count this but a little thing to ask of you. When I mean to
9052,OTHELLO,"try your love indeed, I shall ask a weighty matter."" Othello could"
9053,OTHELLO,"deny nothing to such a pleader, and only requesting that Desdemona"
9054,OTHELLO,"would leave the time to him, promised to receive Michael Cassio again"
9055,OTHELLO,into favour.
9056,OTHELLO,
9057,OTHELLO,It happened that Othello and Iago had entered into the room
9058,OTHELLO,"where Desdemona was, just as Cassio, who had been imploring her"
9059,OTHELLO,"intercession, was departing at the opposite door; and Iago, who was"
9060,OTHELLO,"full of art, said in a low voice, as if to himself, ""I like not that."""
9061,OTHELLO,Othello took no great notice of what he said; indeed the conference
9062,OTHELLO,which immediately took place with his lady put it out of his head; but
9063,OTHELLO,"he remembered it afterwards. For when Desdemona was gone, Iago, as"
9064,OTHELLO,"if for mere satisfaction of his thought, questioned Othello whether"
9065,OTHELLO,"Michael Cassio, when Othello was courting his lady, knew of his love."
9066,OTHELLO,"To this the general answering in the affirmative, and adding, that he"
9067,OTHELLO,"had gone between them very often during the courtship, Iago knitted"
9068,OTHELLO,"his brow, as if he had got fresh light of some terrible matter, and"
9069,OTHELLO,"cried, ""Indeed!"" This brought into Othello's mind the words which Iago"
9070,OTHELLO,had let fall upon entering the room and seeing Cassio with Desdemona;
9071,OTHELLO,and he began to think there was some meaning in all this: for he
9072,OTHELLO,"deemed Iago to be a just man, and full of love and honesty, and what"
9073,OTHELLO,"in a false knave would be tricks, in him seemed to be the natural"
9074,OTHELLO,"workings of an honest mind, big with something too great for"
9075,OTHELLO,"utterance: and Othello prayed Iago to speak what he knew, and to give"
9076,OTHELLO,"his worst thoughts words. ""And what,"" said Iago, ""if some thoughts"
9077,OTHELLO,"very vile should have intruded into my breast, as where is the palace"
9078,OTHELLO,"into which foul things do not enter?"" Then Iago went on to say, what"
9079,OTHELLO,"a pity it were, if any trouble should arise to Othello out of his"
9080,OTHELLO,imperfect observations; that it would not be for Othello's peace to
9081,OTHELLO,know his thoughts; that people's good names were not to be taken away
9082,OTHELLO,for slight suspicions; and when Othello's curiosity was raised almost
9083,OTHELLO,"to distraction with these hints and scattered words, Iago, as if in"
9084,OTHELLO,"earnest care for Othello's peace of mind, besought him to beware of"
9085,OTHELLO,jealousy: with such art did this villain raise suspicions in the
9086,OTHELLO,"unguarded Othello, by the very caution which he pretended to give"
9087,OTHELLO,"him against suspicion. ""I know,"" said Othello, ""that my wife is fair,"
9088,OTHELLO,"loves company and feasting, is free of speech, sings, plays, and"
9089,OTHELLO,"dances well: but where virtue is, these qualities are virtuous. I must"
9090,OTHELLO,"have proof before I think her dishonest."" Then Iago, as if glad that"
9091,OTHELLO,"Othello was slow to believe ill of his lady, frankly declared that he"
9092,OTHELLO,"had no proof, but begged Othello to observe her behaviour well, when"
9093,OTHELLO,"Cassio was by; not to be jealous, nor too secure neither, for that he"
9094,OTHELLO,"(Iago) knew the dispositions of the Italian ladies, his country-women,"
9095,OTHELLO,better than Othello could do; and that in Venice the wives let heaven
9096,OTHELLO,see many pranks they dared not shew their husbands. Then he artfully
9097,OTHELLO,"insinuated, that Desdemona deceived her father in marrying with"
9098,OTHELLO,"Othello, and carried it so closely, that the poor old man thought that"
9099,OTHELLO,"witchcraft had been used. Othello was much moved with this argument,"
9100,OTHELLO,"which brought the matter home to him, for if she had deceived her"
9101,OTHELLO,"father, why might she not deceive her husband?"
9102,OTHELLO,
9103,OTHELLO,"Iago begged pardon for having moved him; but Othello, assuming an"
9104,OTHELLO,"indifference, while he was really shaken with inward grief at Iago's"
9105,OTHELLO,"words, begged him to go on, which Iago did with many apologies, as"
9106,OTHELLO,"if unwilling to produce any thing against Cassio, whom he called his"
9107,OTHELLO,"friend: he then came strongly to the point, and reminded Othello how"
9108,OTHELLO,Desdemona had refused many suitable matches of her own clime and
9109,OTHELLO,"complexion, and had married him, a Moor, which shewed unnatural in"
9110,OTHELLO,"her, and proved her to have a headstrong will: and when her better"
9111,OTHELLO,"judgment returned, how probable it was she should fall upon comparing"
9112,OTHELLO,Othello with the fine forms and clear white complexions of the young
9113,OTHELLO,Italians her countrymen. He concluded with advising Othello to put
9114,OTHELLO,"off his reconcilement with Cassio a little longer, and in the mean"
9115,OTHELLO,while to note with what earnestness Desdemona should intercede in his
9116,OTHELLO,behalf; for that much would be seen in that. So mischievously did this
9117,OTHELLO,artful villain lay his plots to turn the gentle qualities of this
9118,OTHELLO,"innocent lady into her destruction, and make a net for her out of her"
9119,OTHELLO,own goodness to entrap her: first setting Cassio on to intreat her
9120,OTHELLO,"mediation, and then out of that very mediation contriving stratagems"
9121,OTHELLO,for her ruin.
9122,OTHELLO,
9123,OTHELLO,The conference ended with Iago's begging Othello to account his wife
9124,OTHELLO,"innocent, until he had more decisive proof; and Othello promised to"
9125,OTHELLO,be patient: but from that moment the deceived Othello never tasted
9126,OTHELLO,"content of mind. Poppy, nor the juice of mandragora, nor all the"
9127,OTHELLO,"sleeping potions in the world, could ever again restore to him that"
9128,OTHELLO,"sweet rest, which he had enjoyed but yesterday. His occupation"
9129,OTHELLO,"sickened upon him. He no longer took delight in arms. His heart,"
9130,OTHELLO,"that used to be roused at the sight of troops, and banners, and"
9131,OTHELLO,"battle-array, and would stir and leap at the sound of a drum, or a"
9132,OTHELLO,"trumpet, or a neighing war-horse, seemed to have lost all that pride"
9133,OTHELLO,"and ambition, which are a soldier's virtue; and his military ardour"
9134,OTHELLO,and all his old joys forsook him. Sometimes he thought his wife
9135,OTHELLO,"honest, and at times he thought her not so; sometimes he thought Iago"
9136,OTHELLO,"just, and at times he thought him not so; then he would wish that he"
9137,OTHELLO,"had never known of it; he was not the worse for her loving Cassio,"
9138,OTHELLO,so long as he knew it not: torn in pieces with these distracting
9139,OTHELLO,"thoughts, he once laid hold on Iago's throat, and demanded proof of"
9140,OTHELLO,"Desdemona's guilt, or threatened instant death for his having belied"
9141,OTHELLO,"her. Iago, feigning indignation that his honesty should be taken for"
9142,OTHELLO,"a vice, asked Othello, if he had not sometimes seen a handkerchief"
9143,OTHELLO,"spotted with strawberries in his wife's hand. Othello answered, that"
9144,OTHELLO,"he had given her such a one, and that it was his first gift. ""That"
9145,OTHELLO,"same handkerchief,"" said Iago, ""did I see Michael Cassio this day wipe"
9146,OTHELLO,"his face with."" ""If it be as you say,"" said Othello, ""I will not rest"
9147,OTHELLO,"till a wide revenge swallow them up: and first, for a token of your"
9148,OTHELLO,"fidelity, I expect that Cassio shall be put to death within three"
9149,OTHELLO,"days; and for that fair devil [meaning his lady], I will withdraw and"
9150,OTHELLO,"devise some swift means of death for her."""
9151,OTHELLO,
9152,OTHELLO,"Trifles, light as air, are to the jealous proofs as strong as holy"
9153,OTHELLO,"writ. A handkerchief of his wife's seen in Cassio's hand, was motive"
9154,OTHELLO,enough to the deluded Othello to pass sentence of death upon them
9155,OTHELLO,"both, without once enquiring how Cassio came by it. Desdemona had"
9156,OTHELLO,"never given such a present to Cassio, nor would this constant lady"
9157,OTHELLO,"have wronged her lord with doing so naughty a thing, as giving his"
9158,OTHELLO,presents to another man; both Cassio and Desdemona were innocent of
9159,OTHELLO,"any offence against Othello: but the wicked Iago, whose spirits never"
9160,OTHELLO,"slept in contrivance of villainy, had made his wife (a good, but a"
9161,OTHELLO,"weak woman) steal this handkerchief from Desdemona, under pretence of"
9162,OTHELLO,"getting the work copied, but in reality to drop it in Cassio's way,"
9163,OTHELLO,"where he might find it, and give a handle to Iago's suggestion that it"
9164,OTHELLO,was Desdemona's present.
9165,OTHELLO,
9166,OTHELLO,"Othello, soon after meeting his wife, pretended that he had a head-ach"
9167,OTHELLO,"(as he might indeed with truth), and desired her to lend him her"
9168,OTHELLO,"handkerchief to hold to his temples. She did so. ""Not this,"" said"
9169,OTHELLO,"Othello, ""but that handkerchief I gave you."" Desdemona had it not"
9170,OTHELLO,"about her (for indeed it was stolen as we have related). ""How!"" said"
9171,OTHELLO,"Othello, ""this is a fault indeed. That handkerchief an Egyptian woman"
9172,OTHELLO,"gave to my mother; the woman was a witch, and could read people's"
9173,OTHELLO,"thoughts; she told my mother, while she kept it, it would make her"
9174,OTHELLO,"amiable, and my father would love her; but, if she lost it, or gave"
9175,OTHELLO,"it away, my father's fancy would turn, and he would lothe her as much"
9176,OTHELLO,"as he had loved her. She dying gave it me, and bade me, if I ever"
9177,OTHELLO,"married, to give it to my wife. I did so; take heed of it. Make it a"
9178,OTHELLO,"darling as precious as your eye."" ""Is it possible?"" said the frighted"
9179,OTHELLO,"lady. ""'Tis true:"" continued Othello; ""it is a magical handkerchief;"
9180,OTHELLO,"a sibyl that had lived in the world two hundred years, in a fit of"
9181,OTHELLO,prophetic fury worked it; the silk-worms that furnished the silk were
9182,OTHELLO,"hallowed, and it was dyed in mummy of maidens' hearts conserved."""
9183,OTHELLO,"Desdemona, hearing the wondrous virtues of the handkerchief, was ready"
9184,OTHELLO,"to die with fear, for she plainly perceived she had lost it, and with"
9185,OTHELLO,"it, she feared, the affections of her husband. Then Othello started,"
9186,OTHELLO,"and looked as if he were going to do some rash thing, and still he"
9187,OTHELLO,"demanded the handkerchief, which when she could not produce, she tried"
9188,OTHELLO,"to divert her husband from too serious thoughts, and cheerfully told"
9189,OTHELLO,"him, she saw all his talk about the handkerchief was only to put her"
9190,OTHELLO,"off from her suit about Michael Cassio, whom she went on to praise (as"
9191,OTHELLO,"Iago had foretold), till Othello in perfect distraction burst out of"
9192,OTHELLO,"the room, and then Desdemona, though unwillingly, began to suspect her"
9193,OTHELLO,lord was jealous.
9194,OTHELLO,
9195,OTHELLO,"What cause she could have ministered to him she knew not, and then"
9196,OTHELLO,"she accused herself for accusing the noble Othello, and thought to be"
9197,OTHELLO,"sure that some untoward news from Venice, or some state troubles, had"
9198,OTHELLO,"puddled his spirits, and made his temper not so sweet as formerly. And"
9199,OTHELLO,"she said, ""Men are not gods, and we must not look for that observance"
9200,OTHELLO,"from them when they are married, which they shew us on the bridal"
9201,OTHELLO,"day."" And she beshrewed herself for so unkindly judging of his"
9202,OTHELLO,unkindness.
9203,OTHELLO,
9204,OTHELLO,"Again Othello and Desdemona met, and he accused her more plainly of"
9205,OTHELLO,"being unfaithful, and of loving another man, but he did not name whom:"
9206,OTHELLO,"and Othello wept, and Desdemona said, ""Alas! the heavy day! why do you"
9207,OTHELLO,"weep?"" And Othello told her, he could have borne all sorts of evils"
9208,OTHELLO,"with fortitude--poverty, and disease, and disgrace; but her infidelity"
9209,OTHELLO,"had broken his heart: and he called her a weed, that looked so fair,"
9210,OTHELLO,"and smelled so sweet, that the sense ached at it; and wished she had"
9211,OTHELLO,"never been born. And when he had left her, this innocent lady was so"
9212,OTHELLO,"stupefied with wonder at her lord's untrue suspicion of her, that a"
9213,OTHELLO,"weight-like sleep came over her, and she only desired her attendant to"
9214,OTHELLO,"make her bed, and to lay her wedding-sheets upon it, saying, that when"
9215,OTHELLO,"people teach their babes, they do it by gentle means and easy tasks,"
9216,OTHELLO,and Othello might have chid her so; for in good faith she was but a
9217,OTHELLO,child when she was chidden. And this was all the complaint which this
9218,OTHELLO,gentle lady made.
9219,OTHELLO,
9220,OTHELLO,"Desdemona being retired to bed expecting her lord would follow her,"
9221,OTHELLO,"soon fell into a slumber the effect of her troubled spirits, when"
9222,OTHELLO,"Othello entered the chamber, full of the black purpose which he had"
9223,OTHELLO,"meditated of putting his lady to death. But when he saw her asleep, he"
9224,OTHELLO,"thought he would not shed her blood, nor scar that white skin of hers,"
9225,OTHELLO,more white than alabaster. But he was resolved she should die; else
9226,OTHELLO,"(as he said) she would live to betray more men, as she had done him."
9227,OTHELLO,"Then he kissed her for the last time (as he said), and that kiss was"
9228,OTHELLO,"so sweet, he must needs kiss her again: and he wept, but he said they"
9229,OTHELLO,were cruel tears.
9230,OTHELLO,
9231,OTHELLO,"Desdemona was awakened with his kisses, and she looked upon Othello,"
9232,OTHELLO,"and she saw him gnaw his under-lip, and roll his eyes, and she knew he"
9233,OTHELLO,"was always fatal when he looked so: and he bade her prepare for death,"
9234,OTHELLO,"and to say her prayers, for he would not kill her soul. And this"
9235,OTHELLO,"innocent wife, as she lay at his mercy, begged for compassion, and to"
9236,OTHELLO,"know her fault, and then he named Cassio, and the handkerchief which"
9237,OTHELLO,(he said) she had given him; and as the guiltless lady was proceeding
9238,OTHELLO,"to clear herself, he suddenly would hear no more, but covering her up"
9239,OTHELLO,"in the bed-clothes, stifled her till she died."
9240,OTHELLO,
9241,OTHELLO,"In this instant of time was brought into the house Cassio, wounded and"
9242,OTHELLO,"bleeding, whom Iago had set one of his creatures on to assassinate;"
9243,OTHELLO,but the fellow not succeeding in his attempt to kill Cassio (whom
9244,OTHELLO,"he wounded, but not mortally), and being himself killed by Iago to"
9245,OTHELLO,"prevent discovery, in his pockets were found certain letters, which"
9246,OTHELLO,"made the guilt of Iago, and the innocence of Cassio, clear beyond"
9247,OTHELLO,"all doubt; and Cassio now came to beg pardon of Othello, and to ask"
9248,OTHELLO,"wherein he had offended him, that he had employed Iago to murder him."
9249,OTHELLO,
9250,OTHELLO,"This discovery was as a thunderstroke to Othello, who now plainly"
9251,OTHELLO,"saw that he was no better than a murderer, and that his wife (poor"
9252,OTHELLO,innocent lady) had been ever faithful to him; the extreme anguish of
9253,OTHELLO,"which discovery making life insupportable, he fell upon his sword, and"
9254,OTHELLO,"throwing himself upon the body of his dear injured lady, expired."
9255,OTHELLO,
9256,OTHELLO,These rash acts raised much passion of horror and amazement in the
9257,OTHELLO,"by-standers, for Othello had borne a fair reputation, and till he was"
9258,OTHELLO,"wrought upon by the arts of a villain, which his own noble nature"
9259,OTHELLO,"never gave him leave to suspect, he was a loving and a doting husband."
9260,OTHELLO,"He had loved, not wisely, but too well; and his manly eyes (when he"
9261,OTHELLO,"learned his mistake), though not used to weep on every small occasion,"
9262,OTHELLO,dropt tears as fast as the Arabian trees their gum. And when he was
9263,OTHELLO,dead all his former merits and his valiant acts were remembered.
9264,OTHELLO,"Nothing now remained for his successor, but to put the utmost censure"
9265,OTHELLO,"of the law in force against Iago, who was executed with strict"
9266,OTHELLO,tortures; and to send word to the state of Venice of the lamentable
9267,OTHELLO,death of their renowned general.

9275,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9276,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9277,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Pericles, prince of Tyre, became a voluntary exile from his dominions,"
9278,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to avert the dreadful calamities which Antiochus, the wicked emperor"
9279,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","of Greece, threatened to bring upon his subjects and city of Tyre, in"
9280,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",revenge for a discovery which the prince had made of a shocking deed
9281,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",which the emperor had done in secret; as commonly it proves dangerous
9282,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",to pry into the hidden crimes of great ones. Leaving the government of
9283,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","his people in the hands of his able and honest minister, Hellicanus,"
9284,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Pericles set sail from Tyre, thinking to absent himself till the wrath"
9285,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","of Antiochus, who was mighty, should be appeased."
9286,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9287,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","The first place which the prince directed his course to was Tharsus,"
9288,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",and hearing that the city of Tharsus was at that time suffering under
9289,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","a severe famine, he took with him store of provisions for its relief."
9290,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","On his arrival he found the city reduced to the utmost distress; and,"
9291,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","he coming like a messenger from heaven with his unhoped-for succour,"
9292,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Cleon, the governor of Tharsus, welcomed him with boundless thanks."
9293,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Pericles had not been here many days, before letters came from his"
9294,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","faithful minister, warning him that it was not safe for him to stay"
9295,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","at Tharsus, for Antiochus knew of his abode, and by secret emissaries"
9296,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",dispatched for that purpose sought his life. Upon receipt of these
9297,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","letters Pericles put out to sea again, amidst the blessings and"
9298,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",prayers of a whole people who had been fed by his bounty.
9299,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9300,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","He had not sailed far, when his ship was overtaken by a dreadful"
9301,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","storm, and every man on board perished except Pericles, who was cast"
9302,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","by the sea-waves naked on an unknown shore, where he had not wandered"
9303,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","long before he met with some poor fishermen, who invited him to their"
9304,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","homes, giving him clothes and provisions. The fishermen told Pericles"
9305,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the name of their country was Pentapolis, and that their king was"
9306,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Symonides, commonly called the good Symonides, because of his"
9307,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",peaceable reign and good government. From them he also learned that
9308,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","king Symonides had a fair young daughter, and that the following day"
9309,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","was her birth-day, when a grand tournament was to be held at court,"
9310,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",many princes and knights being come from all parts to try their skill
9311,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","in arms for the love of Thaisa, this fair princess. While the prince"
9312,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","was listening to this account, and secretly lamenting the loss of his"
9313,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","good armour, which disabled him from making one among these valiant"
9314,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","knights, another fisherman brought in a complete suit of armour that"
9315,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","he had taken out of the sea with his fishing-net, which proved to be"
9316,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the very armour he had lost. When Pericles beheld his own armour, he"
9317,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","said, ""Thanks, Fortune; after all my crosses you give me somewhat to"
9318,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","repair myself. This armour was bequeathed to me by my dead father, for"
9319,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","whose dear sake I have so loved it, that whithersoever I went I still"
9320,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","have kept it by me, and the rough sea that parted it from me, having"
9321,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","now become calm, hath given it back again, for which I thank it,"
9322,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","for, since I have my father's gift again, I think my shipwreck no"
9323,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","misfortune."""
9324,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9325,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","The next day Pericles, clad in his brave father's armour, repaired"
9326,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to the royal court of Symonides, where he performed wonders at the"
9327,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","tournament, vanquishing with ease all the brave knights and valiant"
9328,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",princes who contended with him in arms for the honour of Thaisa's
9329,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",love. When brave warriors contended at court-tournaments for the love
9330,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","of kings' daughters, if one proved sole victor over all the rest, it"
9331,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",was usual for the great lady for whose sake these deeds of valour were
9332,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","undertaken to bestow all her respect upon the conqueror, and Thaisa"
9333,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","did not depart from this custom, for she presently dismissed all the"
9334,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","princes and knights whom Pericles had vanquished, and distinguished"
9335,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","him by her especial favour and regard, crowning him with the wreath of"
9336,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","victory, as king of that day's happiness; and Pericles became a most"
9337,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",passionate lover of this beauteous princess from the first moment he
9338,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",beheld her.
9339,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9340,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",The good Symonides so well approved of the valour and noble qualities

9348,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Pericles had not been many months married to Thaisa, before he"
9349,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",received intelligence that his enemy Antiochus was dead; and that his
9350,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","subjects of Tyre, impatient of his long absence, threatened to revolt,"
9351,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",and talked of placing Hellicanus upon his vacant throne. This news
9352,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","came from Hellicanus himself, who being a loyal subject to his royal"
9353,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","master, would not accept of the high dignity offered him, but sent"
9354,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to let Pericles know their intentions, that he might return home and"
9355,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",resume his lawful right. It was matter of great surprise and joy to
9356,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Symonides, to find that his son-in-law (the obscure knight) was the"
9357,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",renowned prince of Tyre; yet again he regretted that he was not the
9358,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","private gentleman he supposed him to be, seeing that he must now part"
9359,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","both with his admired son-in-law and his beloved daughter, whom he"
9360,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","feared to trust to the perils of the sea, because Thaisa was with"
9361,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",child; and Pericles himself wished her to remain with her father till
9362,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","after her confinement, but the poor lady so earnestly desired to go"
9363,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","with her husband, that at last they consented, hoping she would reach"
9364,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",Tyre before she was brought to-bed.
9365,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9366,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","The sea was no friendly element to unhappy Pericles, for long before"
9367,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","they reached Tyre another dreadful tempest arose, which so terrified"
9368,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Thaisa that she was taken ill, and in a short space of time her nurse"
9369,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Lychorida came to Pericles with a little child in her arms, to tell"
9370,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",the prince the sad tidings that his wife died the moment her little
9371,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","babe was born. She held the babe towards its father, saying, ""Here is"
9372,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",a thing too young for such a place. This is the child of your dead
9373,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","queen."" No tongue can tell the dreadful sufferings of Pericles when"
9374,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","he heard his wife was dead. As soon as he could speak, he said, ""O"
9375,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","you gods, why do you make us love your goodly gifts, and then snatch"
9376,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","those gifts away?"" ""Patience, good sir,"" said Lychorida, ""here is all"
9377,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","that is left alive of our dead queen, a little daughter, and for your"
9378,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","child's sake be more manly. Patience, good sir, even for the sake of"
9379,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","this precious charge."" Pericles took the new-born infant in his arms,"
9380,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","and he said to the little babe, ""Now may your life be mild, for a"
9381,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",more blusterous birth had never babe! May your condition be mild and
9382,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","gentle, for you have had the rudest welcome that ever prince's child"
9383,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","did meet with! May that which follows be happy, for you have had as"
9384,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","chiding a nativity as fire, air, water, earth, and heaven, could make,"
9385,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to herald you from the womb! Even at the first, your loss,"" meaning in"
9386,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the death of her mother, ""is more than all the joys which you shall"
9387,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","find upon this earth, to which you are come a new visitor, shall be"
9388,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","able to recompence."""
9389,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9390,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","The storm still continuing to rage furiously, and the sailors having"
9391,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",a superstition that while a dead body remained in the ship the storm
9392,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","would never cease, they came to Pericles to demand that his queen"
9393,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","should be thrown overboard; and they said, ""What courage, sir? God"
9394,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","save you!"" ""Courage enough,"" said the sorrowing prince: ""I do not fear"
9395,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",the storm; it has done to me its worst; yet for the love of this poor
9396,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","infant, this fresh new sea-farer, I wish the storm was over."" ""Sir,"""
9397,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","said the sailors, ""your queen must overboard. The sea works high, the"
9398,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","wind is loud, and the storm will not abate till the ship be cleared"
9399,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","of the dead."" Though Pericles knew how weak and unfounded this"
9400,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","superstition was, yet he patiently submitted, saying, ""As you think"
9401,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","meet. Then she must overboard, most wretched queen!"" And now this"
9402,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","unhappy prince went to take a last view of his dear wife, and as he"
9403,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","looked on his Thaisa, he said, ""A terrible child-bed hast thou had, my"
9404,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","dear; no light, no fire; the unfriendly elements forgot thee utterly,"
9405,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","nor have I time to bring thee hallowed to thy grave, but must cast"
9406,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","thee scarcely coffined into the sea, where for a monument upon thy"
9407,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","bones the humming waters must overwhelm thy corpse, lying with simple"
9408,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","shells. O Lychorida, bid Nestor bring me spices, ink, and paper, my"
9409,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","casket and my jewels, and bid Nicandor bring me the satin coffin. Lay"
9410,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the babe upon the pillow, and go about this suddenly, Lychorida, while"
9411,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","I say a priestly farewel to my Thaisa."""
9412,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9413,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","They brought Pericles a large chest, in which (wrapt in a satin"
9414,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","shroud) he placed his queen, and sweet-smelling spices he strewed"
9415,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","over her, and beside her he placed rich jewels, and a written paper,"
9416,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","telling who she was, and praying, if haply any one should find the"
9417,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","chest which contained the body of his wife, they would give her"
9418,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",burial: and then with his own hands he cast the chest into the sea.
9419,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","When the storm was over, Pericles ordered the sailors to make for"
9420,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Tharsus. ""For,"" said Pericles, ""the babe cannot hold out till we come"
9421,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to Tyre. At Tharsus I will leave it at careful nursing."""
9422,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9423,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","After that tempestuous night when Thaisa was thrown into the sea, and"
9424,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","while it was yet early morning, as Cerimon, a worthy gentleman of"
9425,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Ephesus, and a most skilful physician, was standing by the sea-side,"
9426,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","his servants brought to him a chest, which they said the sea-waves had"
9427,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","thrown on the land. ""I never saw,"" said one of them, ""so huge a billow"
9428,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","as cast it on our shore."" Cerimon ordered the chest to be conveyed to"
9429,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","his own house, and when it was opened he beheld with wonder the body"
9430,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","of a young and lovely lady; and the sweet-smelling spices, and rich"
9431,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","casket of jewels, made him conclude it was some great person who was"
9432,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","thus strangely entombed: searching further, he discovered a paper from"
9433,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",which he learned that the corpse which lay as dead before him had been
9434,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","a queen, and wife to Pericles, prince of Tyre; and much admiring at"
9435,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the strangeness of that accident, and more pitying the husband who"
9436,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","had lost this sweet lady, he said, ""If you are living, Pericles, you"
9437,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","have a heart that even cracks with woe."" Then observing attentively"
9438,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Thaisa's face, he saw how fresh and unlike death her looks were; and"
9439,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","he said, ""They were too hasty that threw you into the sea:"" for he did"
9440,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","not believe her to be dead. He ordered a fire to be made, and proper"
9441,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","cordials to be brought, and soft music to be played, which might"
9442,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",help to calm her amazed spirits if she should revive; and he said
9443,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to those who crowded round her, wondering at what they saw, ""I pray"
9444,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","you, gentlemen, give her air; this queen will live; she has not been"
9445,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","entranced above five hours; and see, she begins to blow into life"
9446,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","again; she is alive; behold, her eyelids move; this fair creature will"
9447,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","live to make us weep to hear her fate."" Thaisa had never died, but"
9448,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","after the birth of her little baby had fallen into a deep swoon, which"
9449,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",made all that saw her conclude her to be dead; and now by the care
9450,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",of this kind gentleman she once more revived to light and life; and
9451,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","opening her eyes, she said, ""Where am I? Where is my lord? What world"
9452,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","is this?"" By gentle degrees Cerimon let her understand what had"
9453,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",befallen her; and when he thought she was enough recovered to bear the
9454,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","sight, he shewed her the paper written by her husband, and the jewels;"
9455,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","and she looked on the paper, and said, ""It is my lord's writing. That"
9456,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","I was shipped at sea, I well remember, but whether there delivered of"
9457,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","my babe, by the holy gods I cannot rightly say; but since my wedded"
9458,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","lord I never shall see again, I will put on a vestal livery, and never"
9459,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","more have joy."" ""Madam,"" said Cerimon, ""if you purpose as you speak,"
9460,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the temple of Diana is not far distant from hence, there you may abide"
9461,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","as a vestal. Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine shall there"
9462,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","attend you."" This proposal was accepted with thanks by Thaisa; and"
9463,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","when she was perfectly recovered, Cerimon placed her in the temple of"
9464,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Diana, where she became a vestal or priestess of that goddess, and"
9465,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","passed her days in sorrowing for her husband's supposed loss, and in"
9466,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",the most devout exercises of those times.
9467,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9468,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Pericles carried his young daughter (whom he named Marina, because she"
9469,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","was born at sea) to Tharsus, intending to leave her with Cleon, the"
9470,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","governor of that city, and his wife Dionysia, thinking, for the good"
9471,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","he had done to them at the time of their famine, they would be kind to"
9472,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","his little motherless daughter. When Cleon saw prince Pericles, and"
9473,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","heard of the great loss which had befallen him, he said, ""O your sweet"
9474,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","queen, that it had pleased heaven you could have brought her hither"
9475,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to have blessed my eyes with the sight of her!"" Pericles replied, ""We"
9476,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",must obey the powers above us. Should I rage and roar as the sea does
9477,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","in which my Thaisa lies, yet the end must be as it is. My gentle babe,"
9478,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Marina here, I must charge your charity with her. I leave her the"
9479,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","infant of your care, beseeching you to give her princely training."""
9480,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","And then turning to Cleon's wife, Dionysia, he said, ""Good madam, make"
9481,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","me blessed in your care in bringing up my child:"" and she answered,"
9482,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","""I have a child myself who shall not be more dear to my respect than"
9483,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","yours, my lord;"" and Cleon made the like promise, saying, ""Your noble"
9484,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","services, prince Pericles, in feeding my whole people with your corn"
9485,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",(for which in their prayers they daily remember you) must in your
9486,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","child be thought on. If I should neglect your child, my whole people"
9487,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",that were by you relieved would force me to my duty; but if to that
9488,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","I need a spur, the gods revenge it on me and mine to the end of"
9489,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","generation."" Pericles being thus assured that his child would be"
9490,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","carefully attended to, left her to the protection of Cleon and his"
9491,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","wife Dionysia, and with her he left the nurse Lychorida. When he went"
9492,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","away, the little Marina knew not her loss, but Lychorida wept sadly"
9493,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","at parting with her royal master. ""O, no tears, Lychorida,"" said"
9494,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Pericles; ""no tears; look to your little mistress, on whose grace you"
9495,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","may depend hereafter."""
9496,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9497,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Pericles arrived in safety at Tyre, and was once more settled in"
9498,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the quiet possession of his throne, while his woeful queen, whom he"
9499,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","thought dead, remained at Ephesus. Her little babe Marina, whom this"
9500,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","hapless mother had never seen, was brought up by Cleon in a manner"
9501,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","suitable to her high birth. He gave her the most careful education, so"
9502,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","that by the time Marina attained the age of fourteen years, the most"
9503,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",deeply-learned men were not more studied in the learning of those
9504,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","times than was Marina. She sung like one immortal, and danced as"
9505,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","goddess-like, and with her needle she was so skilful that she seemed"
9506,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to compose nature's own shapes, in birds, fruits, or flowers, the"
9507,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",natural roses being scarcely more like to each other than they were to
9508,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",Marina's silken flowers. But when she had gained from education all
9509,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","these graces, which made her the general wonder, Dionysia, the wife of"
9510,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Cleon, became her mortal enemy from jealousy, by reason that her own"
9511,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","daughter, from the slowness of her mind, was not able to attain to"
9512,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",that perfection wherein Marina excelled: and finding that all praise
9513,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","was bestowed on Marina, whilst her daughter, who was of the same age"
9514,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","and had been educated with the same care as Marina, though not with"
9515,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the same success, was in comparison disregarded, she formed a project"
9516,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to remove Marina out of the way, vainly imagining that her untoward"
9517,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",daughter would be more respected when Marina was no more seen. To
9518,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","encompass this she employed a man to murder Marina, and she well timed"
9519,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","her wicked design, when Lychorida, the faithful nurse, had just died."
9520,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",Dionysia was discoursing with the man she had commanded to commit this
9521,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","murder, when the young Marina was weeping over the dead Lychorida."
9522,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Leoline, the man she employed to do this bad deed, though he was"
9523,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","a very wicked man, could hardly be persuaded to undertake it, so"
9524,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","had Marina won all hearts to love her. He said, ""She is a goodly"
9525,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","creature!"" ""The fitter then the gods should have her,"" replied her"
9526,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","merciless enemy: ""here she comes weeping for the death of her nurse"
9527,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Lychorida: are you resolved to obey me?"" Leoline, fearing to disobey"
9528,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","her, replied, ""I am resolved."" And so, in that one short sentence, was"
9529,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the matchless Marina doomed to an untimely death. She now approached,"
9530,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","with a basket of flowers in her hand, which she said she would daily"
9531,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",strew over the grave of good Lychorida. The purple violet and the
9532,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","marigold should as a carpet hang upon her grave, while summer days did"
9533,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","last. ""Alas, for me!"" she said, ""poor unhappy maid, born in a tempest,"
9534,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","when my mother died. This world to me is like a lasting storm,"
9535,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","hurrying me from my friends."" ""How now, Marina,"" said the dissembling"
9536,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Dionysia, ""do you weep alone? How does it chance my daughter is not"
9537,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","with you? Do not sorrow for Lychorida, you have a nurse in me. Your"
9538,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","beauty is quite changed with this unprofitable woe. Come, give me your"
9539,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","flowers, the sea-air will spoil them; and walk with Leoline: the air"
9540,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","is fine, and will enliven you. Come, Leoline, take her by the arm,"
9541,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","and walk with her."" ""No, madam,"" said Marina, ""I pray you let me"
9542,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","not deprive you of your servant:"" for Leoline was one of Dionysia's"
9543,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","attendants. ""Come, come,"" said this artful woman, who wished for a"
9544,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","pretence to leave her alone with Leoline, ""I love the prince, your"
9545,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","father, and I love you. We every day expect your father here; and when"
9546,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","he comes, and finds you so changed by grief from the paragon of beauty"
9547,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","we reported you, he will think we have taken no care of you. Go,"
9548,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","I pray you, walk, and be cheerful once again. Be careful of that"
9549,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","excellent complexion, which stole the hearts of old and young."""
9550,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Marina, being thus importuned, said, ""Well, I will go, but yet I"
9551,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","have no desire to it."" As Dionysia walked away, she said to Leoline,"
9552,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","""_Remember what I have said!_""--shocking words, for their meaning was"
9553,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",that he should remember to kill Marina.
9554,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9555,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Marina looked towards the sea, her birthplace, and said, ""Is the wind"
9556,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","westerly that blows?"" ""South-west,"" replied Leoline. ""When I was born"
9557,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the wind was north,"" said she: and then the storm and tempest, and all"
9558,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","her father's sorrows, and her mother's death, came full into her mind;"
9559,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","and she said, ""My father, as Lychorida told me, did never fear, but"
9560,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","cried, _Courage, good seamen_, to the sailors, galling his princely"
9561,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","hands with the ropes, and, clasping to the mast, he endured a sea"
9562,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","that almost split the deck."" ""When was this?"" said Leoline. ""When I"
9563,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","was born,"" replied Marina: ""never were waves nor wind more violent."""
9564,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","And then she described the storm, the action of the sailors, the"
9565,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","boatswain's whistle, and the loud call of the master, ""Which,"" said"
9566,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","she, ""trebled the confusion of the ship."" Lychorida had so often"
9567,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","recounted to Marina the story of her hapless birth, that these things"
9568,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",seemed ever present to her imagination. But here Leoline interrupted
9569,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","her with desiring her to say her prayers. ""What mean you?"" said"
9570,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Marina, who began to fear, she knew not why. ""If you require a little"
9571,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","space for prayer, I grant it,"" said Leoline; ""but be not tedious, the"
9572,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn to do my work in haste."" ""Will"
9573,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","you kill me?"" said Marina: ""alas! why?"" ""To satisfy my lady,"" replied"
9574,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Leoline. ""Why would she have me killed?"" said Marina: ""now, as I can"
9575,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","remember, I never hurt her in all my life. I never spake bad word,"
9576,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","nor did any ill turn to any living creature. Believe me now, I never"
9577,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","killed a mouse, nor hurt a fly. I trod upon a worm once against my"
9578,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","will, but I wept for it. How have I offended?"" The murderer replied,"
9579,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","""My commission is not to reason on the deed, but do it."" And he was"
9580,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","just going to kill her, when certain pirates happened to land at that"
9581,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","very moment, who seeing Marina, bore her off as a prize to their ship."
9582,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9583,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","The pirate who had made Marina his prize carried her to Metaline, and"
9584,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","sold her for a slave, where, though in that humble condition, Marina"
9585,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",soon became known throughout the whole city of Metaline for her beauty
9586,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",and her virtues; and the person to whom she was sold became rich by
9587,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the money she earned for him. She taught music, dancing, and fine"
9588,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","needle works, and the money she got by her scholars she gave to her"
9589,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",master and mistress; and the fame of her learning and her great
9590,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","industry came to the knowledge of Lysimachus, a young nobleman who was"
9591,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the governor of Metaline, and Lysimachus went himself to the house"
9592,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","where Marina dwelt, to see this paragon of excellence, whom all the"
9593,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",city praised so highly. Her conversation delighted Lysimachus beyond
9594,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","measure, for though he had heard much of this admired maiden, he did"
9595,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","not expect to find her so sensible a lady, so virtuous, and so good,"
9596,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","as he perceived Marina to be; and he left her, saying, he hoped she"
9597,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","would persevere in her industrious and virtuous course, and that if"
9598,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","ever she heard from him again, it should be for her good. Lysimachus"
9599,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","thought Marina such a miracle for sense, fine breeding, and excellent"
9600,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","qualities, as well as for beauty and all outward graces, that he"
9601,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","wished to marry her, and notwithstanding her humble situation, he"
9602,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",hoped to find that her birth was noble; but ever when they asked her
9603,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","parentage, she would sit still and weep."
9604,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9605,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Meantime, at Tharsus, Leoline, fearing the anger of Dionysia, told"
9606,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",her he had killed Marina; and that wicked woman gave out that she was
9607,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","dead, and made a pretended funeral for her, and erected a stately"
9608,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","monument; and shortly after Pericles, accompanied by his loyal"
9609,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","minister Hellicanus, made a voyage from Tyre to Tharsus, on purpose to"
9610,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","see his daughter, intending to take her home with him; and, he never"
9611,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",having beheld her since he left her an infant in the care of Cleon and
9612,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","his wife, how did this good prince rejoice at the thoughts of seeing"
9613,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",this dear child of his buried queen! but when they told him Marina was
9614,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","dead, and showed the monument they had erected for her, great was the"
9615,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","misery this most wretched father endured, and not being able to bear"
9616,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",the sight of that country where his last hope and only memory of his
9617,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","dear Thaisa was entombed, he took ship, and hastily departed from"
9618,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Tharsus. From the day he entered the ship, a dull and heavy melancholy"
9619,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","seized him. He never spoke, and seemed totally insensible to every"
9620,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",thing around him.
9621,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9622,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Sailing from Tharsus to Tyre, the ship in its course passed by"
9623,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Metaline, where Marina dwelt; the governor of which place, Lysimachus,"
9624,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","observing this royal vessel from the shore, and desirous of knowing"
9625,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","who was on board, went in a barge to the side of the ship, to satisfy"
9626,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","his curiosity. Hellicanus received him very courteously, and told him"
9627,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","that the ship came from Tyre, and that they were conducting thither"
9628,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Pericles, their prince; ""A man, sir,"" said Hellicanus, ""who has not"
9629,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","spoken to any one these three months, nor taken any sustenance, but"
9630,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",just to prolong his grief; it would be tedious to repeat the whole
9631,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","ground of his distemper, but the main springs from the loss of a"
9632,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","beloved daughter and a wife."" Lysimachus begged to see this afflicted"
9633,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","prince, and when he beheld Pericles, he saw he had been once a goodly"
9634,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","person, and he said to him, ""Sir king, all hail, the gods preserve"
9635,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","you, hail, royal sir!"" But in vain Lysimachus spoke to him; Pericles"
9636,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","made no answer, nor did he appear to perceive any stranger approached."
9637,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","And then Lysimachus bethought him of the peerless maid Marina, that"
9638,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",haply with her sweet tongue she might win some answer from the silent
9639,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","prince: and with the consent of Hellicanus he sent for Marina, and"
9640,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",when she entered the ship in which her own father sat motionless with
9641,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","grief, they welcomed her on board as if they had known she was their"
9642,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","princess; and they cried, ""She is a gallant lady."" Lysimachus was"
9643,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","well pleased to hear their commendations, and he said, ""She is such"
9644,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","an one that were I well assured she came of noble birth, I would wish"
9645,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","no better choice, and think me rarely blest in a wife."" And then he"
9646,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","addressed her in courtly terms, as if the lowly-seeming maid had"
9647,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","been the high-born lady he wished to find her, calling _her Fair and"
9648,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","beautiful Marina_, telling her a great prince on board that ship had"
9649,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","fallen into a sad and mournful silence; and, as if Marina had the"
9650,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","power of conferring health and felicity, he begged she would undertake"
9651,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to cure the royal stranger of his melancholy. ""Sir,"" said Marina, ""I"
9652,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","will use my utmost skill in his recovery, provided none but I and my"
9653,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","maid be suffered to come near him."""
9654,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9655,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","She, who at Metaline had so carefully concealed her birth, ashamed to"
9656,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","tell that one of royal ancestry was now a slave, first began to speak"
9657,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to Pericles of the wayward changes in her own fate, telling him from"
9658,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",what a high estate herself had fallen. As if she had known it was her
9659,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","royal father she stood before, all the words she spoke were of her own"
9660,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","sorrows; but her reason for so doing was, that she knew nothing more"
9661,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",wins the attention of the unfortunate than the recital of some sad
9662,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",calamity to match their own. The sound of her sweet voice aroused the
9663,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","drooping prince; he lifted up his eyes, which had been so long fixed"
9664,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","and motionless; and Marina, who was the perfect image of her mother,"
9665,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",presented to his amazed sight the features of his dead queen. The
9666,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","long-silent prince was once more heard to speak. ""My dearest wife,"""
9667,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","said the awakened Pericles, ""was like this maid, and such a one might"
9668,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","my daughter have been. My queen's square brows, her stature to an"
9669,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","inch, as wand-like straight, as silver-voiced, her eyes as jewel-like."
9670,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Where do you live, young maid? Report your parentage. I think you said"
9671,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","you had been tossed from wrong to injury, and that you thought your"
9672,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","griefs would equal mine, if both were opened."" ""Some such thing I"
9673,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","said,"" replied Marina, ""and said no more than what my thoughts did"
9674,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","warrant me as likely."" ""Tell me your story,"" answered Pericles; ""if"
9675,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","I find you have known the thousandth part of my endurance, you have"
9676,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","borne your sorrows like a man, and I have suffered like a girl;"
9677,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","yet you do look like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling"
9678,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Extremity out of act. Tell me your name, my most kind virgin? Recount"
9679,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","your story, I beseech you. Come, sit by me."" How was Pericles"
9680,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","surprised when she said her name was _Marina_, for he knew it was"
9681,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","no usual name, but had been invented by himself for his own child"
9682,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to signify _sea-born_: ""O, I am mocked,"" said he, ""and you are sent"
9683,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","hither by some incensed god to make the world laugh at me."" ""Patience,"
9684,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","good sir,"" said Marina, ""or I must cease here."" ""Nay,"" said Pericles,"
9685,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","""I will be patient; you little know how you do startle me, to call"
9686,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","yourself Marina."" ""The name,"" she replied, ""was given me by one that"
9687,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","had some power, my father, and a king."" ""How, a king's daughter!"" said"
9688,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Pericles, ""and called Marina! But are you flesh and blood? Are you no"
9689,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","fairy? Speak on; where were you born? and wherefore called Marina?"""
9690,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","She replied, ""I was called Marina, because I was born at sea. My"
9691,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","mother was the daughter of a king; she died the minute I was born, as"
9692,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",my good nurse Lychorida has often told me weeping. The king my father
9693,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","left me at Tharsus, till the cruel wife of Cleon sought to murder"
9694,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","me. A crew of pirates came and rescued me, and brought me here to"
9695,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Metaline. But, good sir, why do you weep? It may be, you think me an"
9696,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","impostor. But indeed, sir, I am the daughter to king Pericles, if good"
9697,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","king Pericles be living."" Then Pericles, terrified as it seemed at"
9698,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","his own sudden joy, and doubtful if this could be real, loudly called"
9699,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","for his attendants, who rejoiced at the sound of their beloved king's"
9700,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","voice; and he said to Hellicanus, ""O Hellicanus, strike me, give me a"
9701,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","gash, put me to present pain, lest this great sea of joys rushing upon"
9702,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","me overbear the shores of my mortality. O, come hither, thou that wast"
9703,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","born at sea, buried at Tharsus, and found at sea again. O Hellicanus,"
9704,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","down on your knees, thank the holy gods! This is Marina. Now blessings"
9705,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","on thee, my child! Give me fresh garments, mine own Hellicanus! She is"
9706,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","not dead at Tharsus, as she should have been by the savage Dionysia."
9707,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","She shall tell you all, when you shall kneel to her, and call her"
9708,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","your very princess. Who is this?"" (observing Lysimachus for the first"
9709,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","time). ""Sir,"" said Hellicanus, ""it is the governor of Metaline, who,"
9710,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","hearing of your melancholy, came to see you."" ""I embrace you, sir,"""
9711,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","said Pericles. ""Give me my robes! I am well with beholding--O heaven"
9712,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","bless my girl! But hark! what music is that?""--for now, either sent by"
9713,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","some kind god, or by his own delighted fancy deceived, he seemed to"
9714,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","hear soft music. ""My lord, I hear none,"" replied Hellicanus. ""None,"""
9715,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","said Pericles; ""why it is the music of the spheres."" As there was"
9716,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","no music to be heard, Lysimachus concluded that the sudden joy had"
9717,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","unsettled the prince's understanding; and he said, ""It is not good to"
9718,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","cross him; let him have his way:"" and then they told him they heard"
9719,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the music; and he now complaining of a drowsy slumber coming over him,"
9720,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Lysimachus persuaded him to rest on a couch, and placing a pillow"
9721,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","under his head, he, quite overpowered with excess of joy, sunk into"
9722,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","a sound sleep, and Marina watched in silence by the couch of her"
9723,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",sleeping parent.
9724,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9725,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","While he slept, Pericles dreamed a dream which made him resolve to go"
9726,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to Ephesus. His dream was, that Diana, the Goddess of the Ephesians,"
9727,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","appeared to him, and commanded him to go to her temple at Ephesus,"
9728,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",and there before her altar to declare the story of his life and
9729,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","misfortune; and by her silver bow she swore, that if he performed her"
9730,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","injunction, he should meet with some rare felicity. When he awoke,"
9731,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","being miraculously refreshed, he told his dream, and that his"
9732,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",resolution was to obey the bidding of the Goddess.
9733,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9734,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Then Lysimachus invited Pericles to come on shore, and refresh himself"
9735,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","with such entertainment as he should find at Metaline, which courteous"
9736,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","offer Pericles accepting, agreed to tarry with him for the space of a"
9737,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","day or two. During which time we may well suppose what feastings, what"
9738,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","rejoicings, what costly shews and entertainments the governor made in"
9739,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Metaline, to greet the royal father of his dear Marina, whom in her"
9740,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",obscure fortunes he had so respected. Nor did Pericles frown upon
9741,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Lysimachus's suit, when he understood how he had honoured his child in"
9742,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","the days of her low estate, and that Marina shewed herself not averse"
9743,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to his proposals; only he made it a condition, before he gave his"
9744,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","consent, that they should visit with him the shrine of the Ephesian"
9745,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Diana: to whose temple they, shortly after, all three undertook a"
9746,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","voyage; and, the goddess herself filling their sails with prosperous"
9747,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","winds, after a few weeks they arrived in safety at Ephesus."
9748,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9749,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","There was standing near the altar of the goddess, when Pericles with"
9750,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","his train entered the temple, the good Cerimon (now grown very aged)"
9751,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","who had restored Thaisa, the wife of Pericles, to life; and Thaisa,"
9752,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","now a priestess of the temple, was standing before the altar; and"
9753,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",though the many years he had passed in sorrow for her loss had much
9754,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","altered Pericles, Thaisa thought she knew her husband's features, and"
9755,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","when he approached the altar and began to speak, she remembered his"
9756,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","voice, and listened to his words with wonder and a joyful amazement."
9757,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","And these were the words that Pericles spoke before the altar: ""Hail,"
9758,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Diana! to perform thy just commands, I here confess myself the prince"
9759,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","of Tyre, who, frighted from my country, at Pentapolis wedded the fair"
9760,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Thaisa: she died at sea in childbed, but brought forth a maid-child"
9761,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","called Marina. The maid at Tharsus was nursed with Dionysia, who at"
9762,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",fourteen years thought to kill her; but her better stars brought her
9763,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","to Metaline, by whose shores as I sailed, her good fortunes brought"
9764,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","this child on board, where by her most clear remembrance she made"
9765,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","herself known to be my daughter."""
9766,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9767,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Thaisa, unable to bear the transports which his words had raised in"
9768,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","her, cried out, ""You are, you are, O royal Pericles""--and fainted."
9769,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","""What means this woman?"" said Pericles: ""she dies; help, gentlemen!"""
9770,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","""Sir,"" said Cerimon, ""if you have told Diana's altar true, this is"
9771,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","your wife."" ""Reverend gentleman, no;"" said Pericles: ""I threw her"
9772,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","overboard with these very arms."" Cerimon then recounted how, early one"
9773,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","tempestuous morning, this lady was thrown upon the Ephesian shore;"
9774,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","how, opening the coffin, he found therein rich jewels, and a paper;"
9775,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","how, happily, he recovered her, and placed her here in Diana's temple."
9776,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","And now, Thaisa being restored from her swoon, said, ""O my lord, are"
9777,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","you not Pericles? Like him you speak, like him you are. Did you not"
9778,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","name a tempest, a birth and death?"" He, astonished, said, ""The voice"
9779,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","of dead Thaisa!"" ""That Thaisa am I,"" she replied, ""supposed dead and"
9780,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","drowned."" ""O true Diana!"" exclaimed Pericles, in a passion of devout"
9781,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","astonishment. ""And now,"" said Thaisa, ""I know you better. Such a ring"
9782,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","as I see on your finger did the king my father give you, when we"
9783,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","with tears parted from him at Pentapolis."" ""Enough, you gods!"" cried"
9784,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Pericles, ""your present kindness makes my past miseries sport. O come,"
9785,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Thaisa, be buried a second time within these arms."""
9786,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9787,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","And Marina said, ""My heart leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom."""
9788,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Then did Pericles shew his daughter to her mother, saying, ""Look"
9789,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","who kneels here, flesh of thy flesh, thy burthen at sea, and called"
9790,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Marina, because she was yielded there."" ""Blest and my own!"" said"
9791,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Thaisa: and while she hung in rapturous joy over her child, Pericles"
9792,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","knelt before the altar, saying, ""Pure Diana, bless thee for thy"
9793,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","vision. For this, I will offer oblations nightly to thee."" And then"
9794,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","and there did Pericles, with the consent of Thaisa, solemnly affiance"
9795,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","their daughter, the virtuous Marina, to the well-deserving Lysimachus"
9796,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",in marriage.
9797,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",
9798,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Thus have we seen in Pericles, his queen, and daughter, a famous"
9799,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",example of virtue assailed by calamity (through the sufferance of
9800,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Heaven, to teach patience and constancy to men), under the same"
9801,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","guidance becoming finally successful, and triumphing over chance and"
9802,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","change. In Hellicanus we have beheld a notable pattern of truth, of"
9803,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","faith, and loyalty, who, when he might have succeeded to a throne,"
9804,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","chose rather to recall the rightful owner to his possession, than to"
9805,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","become great by another's wrong. In the worthy Cerimon, who restored"
9806,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Thaisa to life, we are instructed how goodness directed by knowledge,"
9807,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","in bestowing benefits upon mankind, approaches to the nature of the"
9808,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","gods. It only remains to be told, that Dionysia, the wicked wife of"
9809,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","Cleon, met with an end proportionable to her deserts; the inhabitants"
9810,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","of Tharsus, when her cruel attempt upon Marina was known, rising"
9811,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","in a body to revenge the daughter of their benefactor, and setting"
9812,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","fire to the palace of Cleon, burnt both him and her, and their whole"
9813,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","household: the gods seeming well pleased, that so foul a murder,"
9814,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE","though but intentional, and never carried into act, should be punished"
9815,"PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE",in a way befitting its enormity.

9830,PREFACE,
9831,PREFACE,This work is designed as a supplement to the Adventures of Telemachus.
9832,PREFACE,"It treats of the conduct and sufferings of Ulysses, the father of"
9833,PREFACE,Telemachus. The picture which it exhibits is that of a brave man
9834,PREFACE,"struggling with adversity; by a wise use of events, and with an"
9835,PREFACE,"inimitable presence of mind under difficulties, forcing out a way"
9836,PREFACE,for himself through the severest trials to which human life can be
9837,PREFACE,exposed; with enemies natural and preternatural surrounding him on all
9838,PREFACE,"sides. The agents in this tale, besides men and women, are giants,"
9839,PREFACE,"enchanters, sirens: things which denote external force or internal"
9840,PREFACE,"temptations, the twofold danger which a wise fortitude must expect to"
9841,PREFACE,encounter in its course through this world. The fictions contained in
9842,PREFACE,it will be found to comprehend some of the most admired inventions of
9843,PREFACE,Grecian mythology.
9844,PREFACE,
9845,PREFACE,"The ground-work of the story is as old as the Odyssey, but the moral"
9846,PREFACE,and the colouring are comparatively modern. By avoiding the prolixity
9847,PREFACE,"which marks the speeches and the descriptions in Homer, I have gained"
9848,PREFACE,"a rapidity to the narration, which I hope will make it more attractive"
9849,PREFACE,"and give it more the air of a romance to young readers, though I am"
9850,PREFACE,sensible that by the curtailment I have sacrificed in many places
9851,PREFACE,"the manners to the passion, the subordinate characteristics to the"
9852,PREFACE,essential interest of the story. The attempt is not to be considered
9853,PREFACE,as seeking a comparison with any of the direct translations of the
9854,PREFACE,"Odyssey, either in prose or verse, though if I were to state the"
9855,PREFACE,"obligations which I have had to one obsolete version,[1] I should"
9856,PREFACE,run the hazard of depriving myself of the very slender degree of
9857,PREFACE,reputation which I could hope to acquire from a trifle like the
9858,PREFACE,present undertaking.

9882,CHAPTER I,as his country earth. This made him refuse the offers of the goddess
9883,CHAPTER I,"Calypso to stay with her, and partake of her immortality, in the"
9884,CHAPTER I,delightful island; and this gave him strength to break from the
9885,CHAPTER I,"enchantments of Circe, the daughter of the Sun."
9886,CHAPTER I,
9887,CHAPTER I,From Troy ill winds cast Ulysses and his fleet upon the coast of the
9888,CHAPTER I,"Cicons, a people hostile to the Grecians. Landing his forces, he laid"
9889,CHAPTER I,"siege to their chief city Ismarus, which he took, and with it much"
9890,CHAPTER I,"spoil, and slew many people. But success proved fatal to him; for his"
9891,CHAPTER I,"soldiers elated with the spoil, and the good store of provisions which"
9892,CHAPTER I,"they found in that place, fell to eating and drinking, forgetful of"
9893,CHAPTER I,"their safety, till the Cicons, who inhabited the coast, had time to"
9894,CHAPTER I,"assemble their friends and allies from the interior, who mustering"
9895,CHAPTER I,"in prodigious force, set upon the Grecians, while they negligently"
9896,CHAPTER I,"revelled and feasted, and slew many of them, and recovered the spoil."
9897,CHAPTER I,"They, dispirited and thinned in their numbers, with difficulty made"
9898,CHAPTER I,"their retreat good to the ships. Thence they set sail, sad at heart,"
9899,CHAPTER I,yet something cheered that with such fearful odds against them they
9900,CHAPTER I,"had not all been utterly destroyed. A dreadful tempest ensued, which"
9901,CHAPTER I,"for two nights and two days tossed them about, but the third day the"
9902,CHAPTER I,"weather cleared, and they had hopes of a favourable gale to carry them"
9903,CHAPTER I,"to Ithaca; but as they doubled the Cape of Malea, suddenly a north"
9904,CHAPTER I,"wind arising, drove them back as far as Cythera. After that, for the"
9905,CHAPTER I,"space of nine days, contrary winds continued to drive them in an"
9906,CHAPTER I,"opposite direction to the point to which they were bound, and the"
9907,CHAPTER I,tenth day they put in at a shore where a race of men dwell that are
9908,CHAPTER I,sustained by the fruit of the lotos tree. Here Ulysses sent some
9909,CHAPTER I,"of his men to land for fresh water, who were met by certain of the"
9910,CHAPTER I,"inhabitants, that gave them some of their country food to eat; not"
9911,CHAPTER I,"with any ill intention towards them, though in the event it proved"
9912,CHAPTER I,"pernicious; for, having eaten of this fruit, so pleasant it proved to"
9913,CHAPTER I,"their appetite, that they in a minute quite forgot all thoughts of"
9914,CHAPTER I,"home, or of their countrymen, or of ever returning back to the ships"
9915,CHAPTER I,"to give an account of what sort of inhabitants dwelt there, but they"
9916,CHAPTER I,"would needs stay and live there among them, and eat of that precious"
9917,CHAPTER I,food for ever; and when Ulysses sent other of his men to look for
9918,CHAPTER I,"them, and to bring them back by force, they strove, and wept, and"
9919,CHAPTER I,"would not leave their food for heaven itself, so much the pleasure of"
9920,CHAPTER I,that enchanting fruit had bewitched them. But Ulysses caused them to
9921,CHAPTER I,"be bound hand and foot, and cast under the hatches; and set sail with"
9922,CHAPTER I,"all possible speed from that baneful coast, lest others after them"
9923,CHAPTER I,"might taste the lotos, which had such strange qualities to make men"
9924,CHAPTER I,"forget their native country, and the thoughts of home."
9925,CHAPTER I,
9926,CHAPTER I,"Coasting on all that night by unknown and out of the way shores, they"
9927,CHAPTER I,"came by day-break to the land where the Cyclops dwell, a sort of giant"
9928,CHAPTER I,"shepherds that neither sow nor plough, but the earth unfilled produces"
9929,CHAPTER I,"for them rich wheat and barley and grapes, yet they have neither bread"
9930,CHAPTER I,"nor wine, nor know the arts of cultivation, nor care to know them:"
9931,CHAPTER I,"for they live each man to himself, without laws or government, or any"
9932,CHAPTER I,"thing like a state or kingdom, but their dwellings are in caves, on"
9933,CHAPTER I,"the steep heads of mountains, every man's household governed by his"
9934,CHAPTER I,"own caprice, or not governed at all, their wives and children as"
9935,CHAPTER I,"lawless as themselves, none caring for others, but each doing as he or"
9936,CHAPTER I,"she thinks good. Ships or boats they have none, nor artificers to make"
9937,CHAPTER I,"them, no trade or commerce, or wish to visit other shores; yet they"
9938,CHAPTER I,have convenient places for harbours and for shipping. Here Ulysses
9939,CHAPTER I,"with a chosen party of twelve followers landed, to explore what sort"
9940,CHAPTER I,"of men dwelt there, whether hospitable and friendly to strangers, or"
9941,CHAPTER I,"altogether wild and savage, for as yet no dwellers appeared in sight."
9942,CHAPTER I,
9943,CHAPTER I,The first sign of habitation which they came to was a giant's cave
9944,CHAPTER I,"rudely fashioned, but of a size which betokened the vast proportions"
9945,CHAPTER I,"of its owner, the pillars which supported it being the bodies of huge"
9946,CHAPTER I,"oaks or pines, in the natural state of the tree, and all about showed"
9947,CHAPTER I,"more marks of strength than skill in whoever built it. Ulysses,"
9948,CHAPTER I,"entering in, admired the savage contrivances and artless structure of"
9949,CHAPTER I,"the place, and longed to see the tenant of so outlandish a mansion;"
9950,CHAPTER I,but well conjecturing that gifts would have more avail in extracting
9951,CHAPTER I,"courtesy, than strength could succeed in forcing it, from such a one"
9952,CHAPTER I,"as he expected to find the inhabitant, he resolved to flatter his"
9953,CHAPTER I,"hospitality with a present of Greek wine, of which he had store in"
9954,CHAPTER I,twelve great vessels; so strong that no one ever drank it without an
9955,CHAPTER I,"infusion of twenty parts of water to one of wine, yet the fragrance of"
9956,CHAPTER I,"it even then so delicious, that it would have vexed a man who smelled"
9957,CHAPTER I,"it to abstain from tasting it; but whoever tasted it, it was able to"
9958,CHAPTER I,raise his courage to the height of heroic deeds. Taking with them a
9959,CHAPTER I,"goat-skin flaggon full of this precious liquor, they ventured into the"
9960,CHAPTER I,recesses of the cave. Here they pleased themselves a whole day with
9961,CHAPTER I,"beholding the giant's kitchen, where the flesh of sheep and goats lay"
9962,CHAPTER I,"strewed, his dairy where goat-milk stood ranged in troughs and pails,"
9963,CHAPTER I,his pens where he kept his live animals; but those he had driven forth
9964,CHAPTER I,to pasture with him when he went out in the morning. While they were
9965,CHAPTER I,"feasting their eyes with a sight of these curiosities, their ears were"
9966,CHAPTER I,suddenly deafened with a noise like the falling of a house. It was
9967,CHAPTER I,"the owner of the cave who had been abroad all day feeding his flock,"
9968,CHAPTER I,"as his custom was, in the mountains, and now drove them home in the"
9969,CHAPTER I,"evening from pasture. He threw down a pile of firewood, which he had"
9970,CHAPTER I,"been gathering against supper-time, before the mouth of the cave,"
9971,CHAPTER I,which occasioned the crash they heard. The Grecians hid themselves
9972,CHAPTER I,"in the remote parts of the cave, at sight of the uncouth monster. It"
9973,CHAPTER I,"was Polyphemus, the largest and savagest of the Cyclops, who boasted"
9974,CHAPTER I,himself to be the son of Neptune. He looked more like a mountain crag
9975,CHAPTER I,"than a man, and to his brutal body he had a brutish mind answerable."
9976,CHAPTER I,"He drove his flock, all that gave milk, to the interior of the cave,"
9977,CHAPTER I,but left the rams and the he-goats without Then taking up a stone so
9978,CHAPTER I,"massy that twenty oxen could not have drawn it, he placed it at the"
9979,CHAPTER I,"mouth of the cave, to defend the entrance, and sat him down to milk"
9980,CHAPTER I,"his ewes and his goats; which done, he lastly kindled a fire, and"
9981,CHAPTER I,throwing his great eye round the cave (for the Cyclops have no more
9982,CHAPTER I,"than one eye, and that placed in the midst of their forehead), by the"
9983,CHAPTER I,glimmering light he discerned some of Ulysses's men.
9984,CHAPTER I,
9985,CHAPTER I,"""Ho! guests, what are you? merchants or wandering thieves?"" he"
9986,CHAPTER I,"bellowed out in a voice which took from them all power of reply, it"
9987,CHAPTER I,was so astounding.
9988,CHAPTER I,
9989,CHAPTER I,"Only Ulysses summoned resolution to answer, that they came neither"
9990,CHAPTER I,"for plunder nor traffick, but were Grecians who had lost their"
9991,CHAPTER I,"way, returning from Troy; which famous city, under the conduct of"
9992,CHAPTER I,"Agamemnon, the renowned son of Atreus, they had sacked, and laid level"
9993,CHAPTER I,with the ground. Yet now they prostrated themselves humbly before his
9994,CHAPTER I,"feet, whom they acknowledged to be mightier than they, and besought"
9995,CHAPTER I,"him that he would bestow the rites of hospitality upon them, for that"
9996,CHAPTER I,"Jove was the avenger of wrongs done to strangers, and would fiercely"
9997,CHAPTER I,resent any injury which they might suffer.
9998,CHAPTER I,
9999,CHAPTER I,"""Fool,"" said the Cyclop, ""to come so far to preach to me the fear of"
10000,CHAPTER I,"the gods. We Cyclops care not for your Jove, whom you fable to be"
10001,CHAPTER I,"nursed by a goat, nor any of your blessed ones. We are stronger than"
10002,CHAPTER I,"they, and dare bid open battle to Jove himself, though you and all"
10003,CHAPTER I,"your fellows of the earth join with him."" And he bade them tell him"
10004,CHAPTER I,"where their ship was, in which they came, and whether they had any"
10005,CHAPTER I,"companions. But Ulysses, with a wise caution made answer, that they"
10006,CHAPTER I,"had no ship or companions, but were unfortunate men whom the sea,"
10007,CHAPTER I,"splitting their ship in pieces, had dashed upon his coast, and"
10008,CHAPTER I,"they alone had escaped. He replied nothing, but griping two of the"
10009,CHAPTER I,"nearest of them, as if they had been no more than children, he dashed"
10010,CHAPTER I,"their brains out against the earth, and (shocking to relate) tore"
10011,CHAPTER I,"in pieces their limbs, and devoured them, yet warm and trembling,"
10012,CHAPTER I,"making a lion's meal of them, lapping the blood: for the Cyclops are"
10013,CHAPTER I,"_man-eaters_, and esteem human flesh to be a delicacy far above goat's"
10014,CHAPTER I,or kid's; though by reason of their abhorred customs few men approach
10015,CHAPTER I,"their coast, except some stragglers, or now and then a ship-wrecked"
10016,CHAPTER I,mariner. At a sight so horrid Ulysses and his men were like distracted
10017,CHAPTER I,"people. He, when he had made an end of his wicked supper, drained a"
10018,CHAPTER I,"draught of goat's milk down his prodigious throat, and lay down and"
10019,CHAPTER I,"slept among his goats. Then Ulysses drew his sword, and half resolved"
10020,CHAPTER I,to thrust it with all his might in at the bosom of the sleeping
10021,CHAPTER I,"monster; but wiser thoughts restrained him, else they had there"
10022,CHAPTER I,"without help all perished, for none but Polyphemus himself could have"
10023,CHAPTER I,removed that mass of stone which he had placed to guard the entrance.
10024,CHAPTER I,So they were constrained to abide all that night in fear.
10025,CHAPTER I,
10026,CHAPTER I,"When day came the Cyclop awoke, and kindling a fire, made his"
10027,CHAPTER I,"breakfast of two other of his unfortunate prisoners, then milked his"
10028,CHAPTER I,"goats as he was accustomed, and pushing aside the vast stone, and"
10029,CHAPTER I,"shutting it again when he had done, upon the prisoners, with as much"
10030,CHAPTER I,"ease as a man opens and shuts a quiver's lid, he let out his flock,"
10031,CHAPTER I,and drove them before him with whistlings (as sharp as winds in
10032,CHAPTER I,"storms) to the mountains. Then Ulysses, of whose strength or cunning"
10033,CHAPTER I,"the Cyclop seems to have had as little heed as of an infant's, being"
10034,CHAPTER I,"left alone, with the remnant of his men which the Cyclop had not"
10035,CHAPTER I,"devoured, gave manifest proof how far manly wisdom excels brutish"
10036,CHAPTER I,force. He chose a stake from among the wood which the Cyclop had piled
10037,CHAPTER I,"up for firing, in length and thickness like a mast, which he sharpened"
10038,CHAPTER I,"and hardened in the fire, and selected four men, and instructed them"
10039,CHAPTER I,"what they should do with this stake, and made them perfect in their"
10040,CHAPTER I,parts.
10041,CHAPTER I,
10042,CHAPTER I,"When the evening was come, the Cyclop drove home his sheep; and"
10043,CHAPTER I,"as fortune directed it, either of purpose, or that his memory was"
10044,CHAPTER I,"overruled by the gods to his hurt (as in the issue it proved), he"
10045,CHAPTER I,"drove the males of his flock, contrary to his custom, along with the"
10046,CHAPTER I,"dams into the pens. Then shutting-to the stone of the cave, he fell to"
10047,CHAPTER I,"his horrible supper. When he had dispatched two more of the Grecians,"
10048,CHAPTER I,"Ulysses waxed bold with the contemplation of his project, and took a"
10049,CHAPTER I,bowl of Greek wine and merrily dared the Cyclop to drink.
10050,CHAPTER I,
10051,CHAPTER I,"""Cyclop,"" he said, ""take a bowl of wine from the hand of your guest:"
10052,CHAPTER I,"it may serve to digest the man's flesh that you have eaten, and shew"
10053,CHAPTER I,"what drink our ship held before it went down. All I ask in recompence,"
10054,CHAPTER I,"if you find it good, is to be dismissed in a whole skin. Truly you"
10055,CHAPTER I,"must look to have few visitors, if you observe this new custom of"
10056,CHAPTER I,"eating your guests."""
10057,CHAPTER I,
10058,CHAPTER I,"The brute took and drank, and vehemently enjoyed the taste of wine,"
10059,CHAPTER I,"which was new to him, and swilled again at the flaggon, and entreated"
10060,CHAPTER I,"for more, and prayed Ulysses to tell him his name, that he might"
10061,CHAPTER I,bestow a gift upon the man who had given him such brave liquor. The
10062,CHAPTER I,"Cyclops (he said) had grapes, but this rich juice (he swore) was"
10063,CHAPTER I,"simply divine. Again Ulysses plied him with the wine, and the fool"
10064,CHAPTER I,"drank it as fast as he poured out, and again he asked the name of"
10065,CHAPTER I,"his benefactor, which Ulysses cunningly dissembling, said, ""My name"
10066,CHAPTER I,"is Noman: my kindred and friends in my own country call me Noman."""
10067,CHAPTER I,"""Then,"" said the Cyclop, ""this is the kindness I will show thee,"
10068,CHAPTER I,"Noman: I will eat thee last of all thy friends."" He had scarce"
10069,CHAPTER I,"expressed his savage kindness, when the fumes of the strong wine"
10070,CHAPTER I,"overcame him, and he reeled down upon the floor and sank into a dead"
10071,CHAPTER I,sleep.
10072,CHAPTER I,
10073,CHAPTER I,"Ulysses watched his time, while the monster lay insensible, and"
10074,CHAPTER I,"heartening up his men, they placed the sharp end of the stake in the"
10075,CHAPTER I,"fire till it was heated red-hot, and some god gave them a courage"
10076,CHAPTER I,"beyond that which they were used to have, and the four men with"
10077,CHAPTER I,"difficulty bored the sharp end of the huge stake, which they had"
10078,CHAPTER I,"heated red-hot, right into the eye of the drunken cannibal, and"
10079,CHAPTER I,"Ulysses helped to thrust it in with all his might, still further and"
10080,CHAPTER I,"further, with effort, as men bore with an auger, till the scalded"
10081,CHAPTER I,"blood gushed out, and the eye-ball smoked, and the strings of the eye"
10082,CHAPTER I,"cracked, as the burning rafter broke in it, and the eye hissed, as hot"
10083,CHAPTER I,iron hisses when it is plunged into water.
10084,CHAPTER I,
10085,CHAPTER I,"He waking, roared with the pain so loud that all the cavern broke into"
10086,CHAPTER I,"claps like thunder. They fled, and dispersed into corners. He plucked"
10087,CHAPTER I,"the burning stake from his eye, and hurled the wood madly about the"
10088,CHAPTER I,cave. Then he cried out with a mighty voice for his brethren the
10089,CHAPTER I,"Cyclops, that dwelt hard by in caverns upon hills; they hearing the"
10090,CHAPTER I,terrible shout came flocking from all parts to inquire what ailed
10091,CHAPTER I,Polyphemus? and what cause he had for making such horrid clamours in
10092,CHAPTER I,the night-time to break their sleeps? if his fright proceeded from any
10093,CHAPTER I,mortal? if strength or craft had given him his death's blow? He made
10094,CHAPTER I,"answer from within that Noman had hurt him, Noman had killed him,"
10095,CHAPTER I,"Noman was with him in the cave. They replied, ""If no man has hurt"
10096,CHAPTER I,"thee, and no man is with thee, then thou art alone, and the evil that"
10097,CHAPTER I,"afflicts thee is from the hand of heaven, which none can resist or"
10098,CHAPTER I,"help."" So they left him and went their way, thinking that some disease"
10099,CHAPTER I,"troubled him. He, blind and ready to split with the anguish of the"
10100,CHAPTER I,"pain, went groaning up and down in the dark, to find the door-way,"
10101,CHAPTER I,"which when he found, he removed the stone, and sat in the threshold,"
10102,CHAPTER I,"feeling if he could lay hold on any man going out with the sheep,"
10103,CHAPTER I,which (the day now breaking) were beginning to issue forth to their
10104,CHAPTER I,"accustomed pastures. But Ulysses, whose first artifice in giving"
10105,CHAPTER I,"himself that ambiguous name, had succeeded so well with the Cyclop,"
10106,CHAPTER I,was not of a wit so gross to be caught by that palpable device. But
10107,CHAPTER I,casting about in his mind all the ways which he could contrive for
10108,CHAPTER I,"escape (no less than all their lives depending on the success), at"
10109,CHAPTER I,last he thought of this expedient. He made knots of the osier twigs
10110,CHAPTER I,"upon which the Cyclop commonly slept, with which he tied the fattest"
10111,CHAPTER I,"and fleeciest of the rams together, three in a rank, and under the"
10112,CHAPTER I,"belly of the middle ram he tied a man, and himself last, wrapping"
10113,CHAPTER I,"himself fast with both his hands in the rich wool of one, the fairest"
10114,CHAPTER I,of the flock.
10115,CHAPTER I,
10116,CHAPTER I,"And now the sheep began to issue forth very fast, the males went"
10117,CHAPTER I,"first, the females unmilked stood by, bleating and requiring the hand"
10118,CHAPTER I,"of their shepherd in vain to milk them, their full bags sore with"
10119,CHAPTER I,"being unemptied, but he much sorer with the loss of sight. Still as"
10120,CHAPTER I,"the males passed, he felt the backs of those fleecy fools, never"
10121,CHAPTER I,"dreaming, that they carried his enemies under their bellies: so they"
10122,CHAPTER I,passed on till the last ram came loaded with his wool and Ulysses
10123,CHAPTER I,"together. He stopped that ram and felt him, and had his hand once in"
10124,CHAPTER I,"the hair of Ulysses, yet knew it not, and he chid the ram for being"
10125,CHAPTER I,"last, and spoke to it as if it understood him, and asked it whether it"
10126,CHAPTER I,"did not wish that its master had his eye again, which that abominable"
10127,CHAPTER I,"Noman with his execrable rout had put out, when they had got him down"
10128,CHAPTER I,with wine; and he willed the ram to tell him whereabouts in the cave
10129,CHAPTER I,"his enemy lurked, that he might dash his brains and strew them about,"
10130,CHAPTER I,to ease his heart of that tormenting revenge which rankled in it.
10131,CHAPTER I,After a deal of such foolish talk to the beast he let it go. When
10132,CHAPTER I,"Ulysses found himself free, he let go his hold, and assisted in"
10133,CHAPTER I,disengaging his friends. The rams which had befriended them they
10134,CHAPTER I,"carried off with them to the ships, where their companions with tears"
10135,CHAPTER I,"in their eyes received them, as men escaped from death. They plied"
10136,CHAPTER I,"their oars, and set their sails, and when they were got as far off"
10137,CHAPTER I,"from shore as a voice would reach, Ulysses cried out to the Cyclop:"
10138,CHAPTER I,"""Cyclop, thou should'st not have so much abused thy monstrous"
10139,CHAPTER I,"strength, as to devour thy guests. Jove by my hand sends thee requital"
10140,CHAPTER I,"to pay thy savage inhumanity."" The Cyclop heard, and came forth"
10141,CHAPTER I,"enraged, and in his anger he plucked a fragment of a rock, and threw"
10142,CHAPTER I,it with blind fury at the ships. It narrowly escaped lighting upon the
10143,CHAPTER I,"bark in which Ulysses sat, but with the fall it raised so fierce an"
10144,CHAPTER I,"ebb, as bore back the ship till it almost touched the shore. ""Cyclop,"""
10145,CHAPTER I,"said Ulysses, ""if any ask thee who imposed on thee that unsightly"
10146,CHAPTER I,"blemish in thine eye, say it was Ulysses, son of Laertes: the king of"
10147,CHAPTER I,"Ithaca am I called, the waster of cities."" Then they crowded sail, and"
10148,CHAPTER I,"beat the old sea, and forth they went with a forward gale; sad for"
10149,CHAPTER I,"fore-past losses, yet glad to have escaped at any rate; till they came"
10150,CHAPTER I,"to the isle where Æolus reigned, who is god of the winds."
10151,CHAPTER I,
10152,CHAPTER I,"Here Ulysses and his men were courteously received by the monarch, who"
10153,CHAPTER I,shewed him his twelve children which have rule over the twelve winds.
10154,CHAPTER I,"A month they staid and feasted with him, and at the end of the month"
10155,CHAPTER I,"he dismissed them with many presents, and gave to Ulysses at parting"
10156,CHAPTER I,"an ox's hide, in which were inclosed _all the winds_: only he left"
10157,CHAPTER I,"abroad the western wind, to play upon their sails and waft them"
10158,CHAPTER I,"gently home to Ithaca. This bag bound in a glittering silver band, so"
10159,CHAPTER I,"close that no breath could escape, Ulysses hung up at the mast. His"
10160,CHAPTER I,"companions did not know its contents, but guessed that the monarch had"
10161,CHAPTER I,given to him some treasures of gold or silver.
10162,CHAPTER I,
10163,CHAPTER I,"Nine days they sailed smoothly, favoured by the western wind, and by"
10164,CHAPTER I,the tenth they approached so nigh as to discern lights kindled on the
10165,CHAPTER I,"shores of their country earth: when by ill fortune, Ulysses, overcome"
10166,CHAPTER I,"with fatigue of watching the helm, fell asleep. The mariners seized"
10167,CHAPTER I,"the opportunity, and one of them said to the rest: ""A fine time has"
10168,CHAPTER I,"this leader of ours: wherever he goes he is sure of presents, when we"
10169,CHAPTER I,"come away empty-handed; and see, what king Æolus has given him, store"
10170,CHAPTER I,"no doubt of gold and silver."" A word was enough to those covetous"
10171,CHAPTER I,"wretches, who quick as thought untied the bag, and instead of gold,"
10172,CHAPTER I,out rushed with mighty noise _all the winds_. Ulysses with the noise
10173,CHAPTER I,"awoke and saw their mistake, but too late, for the ship was driving"
10174,CHAPTER I,"with all the winds back far from Ithaca, far as to the island of Æolus"
10175,CHAPTER I,"from which they had parted, in one hour measuring back what in nine"
10176,CHAPTER I,"days they had scarcely tracked, and in sight of home too! up he flew"
10177,CHAPTER I,"amazed, and raving doubted whether he should not fling himself into"
10178,CHAPTER I,the sea for grief of his bitter disappointment. At last he hid himself
10179,CHAPTER I,"under the hatches for shame. And scarce could he be prevailed upon,"
10180,CHAPTER I,"when he was told he was arrived again in the harbour of king Æolus, to"
10181,CHAPTER I,go himself or send to that monarch for a second succour; so much the
10182,CHAPTER I,disgrace of having misused his royal bounty (though it was the crime
10183,CHAPTER I,of his followers and not his own) weighed upon him: and when at last
10184,CHAPTER I,"he went, and took a herald with him, and came where the god sat on"
10185,CHAPTER I,"his throne, feasting with his children, he would not thrust in among"
10186,CHAPTER I,"them at their meat, but set himself down like one unworthy in the"
10187,CHAPTER I,threshold.

10189,CHAPTER I,Indignation seized Æolus to behold him in that manner returned; and
10190,CHAPTER I,"he said, ""Ulysses, what has brought you back? are you so soon tired"
10191,CHAPTER I,of your country? or did not our present please you? we thought we had
10192,CHAPTER I,"given you a kingly passport."" Ulysses made answer; ""My men have done"
10193,CHAPTER I,"this ill mischief to me: they did it while I slept."" ""Wretch,"" said"
10194,CHAPTER I,"Æolus, ""avaunt, and quit our shores: it fits not us to convoy men whom"
10195,CHAPTER I,"the gods hate, and will have perish."""
10196,CHAPTER I,
10197,CHAPTER I,"Forth they sailed, but with far different hopes than when they left"
10198,CHAPTER I,"the same harbour the first time with all the winds confined, only the"
10199,CHAPTER I,west-wind suffered to play upon their sails to waft them in gentle
10200,CHAPTER I,"murmurs to Ithaca. They were now the sport of every gale that blew,"
10201,CHAPTER I,and despaired of ever seeing home more. Now those covetous mariners
10202,CHAPTER I,"were cured of their surfeit for gold, and would not have touched it if"
10203,CHAPTER I,it had lain in untold heaps before them.
10204,CHAPTER I,
10205,CHAPTER I,"Six days and nights they drove along, and on the seventh day they put"
10206,CHAPTER I,"in to Lamos, a port of the Læstrygonians. So spacious this harbour"
10207,CHAPTER I,"was, that it held with ease all their fleet, which rode at anchor,"
10208,CHAPTER I,"safe from any storms, all but the ship in which Ulysses was embarked."
10209,CHAPTER I,"He, as if prophetic of the mischance which followed, kept still"
10210,CHAPTER I,"without the harbour, making fast his bark to a rock at the land's"
10211,CHAPTER I,"point, which he climbed with purpose to survey the country. He saw a"
10212,CHAPTER I,"city with smoke ascending from the roofs, but neither ploughs going,"
10213,CHAPTER I,"nor oxen yoked, nor any sign of agricultural works. Making choice of"
10214,CHAPTER I,"two men, he sent them to the city to explore what sort of inhabitants"
10215,CHAPTER I,"dwelt there. His messengers had not gone far before they met a damsel,"
10216,CHAPTER I,"of stature surpassing human, who was coming to draw water from a"
10217,CHAPTER I,"spring. They asked her who dwelt in that land. She made no reply, but"
10218,CHAPTER I,led them in silence to her father's palace. He was a monarch and named
10219,CHAPTER I,Antiphas. He and all his people were giants. When they entered the
10220,CHAPTER I,"palace, a woman, the mother of the damsel, but far taller than she,"
10221,CHAPTER I,"rushed abroad and called for Antiphas. He came, and snatching up"
10222,CHAPTER I,"one of the two men, made as if he would devour him. The other fled."
10223,CHAPTER I,"Antiphas raised a mighty shout, and instantly, this way and that,"
10224,CHAPTER I,"multitudes of gigantic people issued out at the gates, and making for"
10225,CHAPTER I,"the harbour, tore up huge pieces of the rocks, and flung them at the"
10226,CHAPTER I,"ships which lay there, all which they utterly overwhelmed and sank;"
10227,CHAPTER I,"and the unfortunate bodies of men which floated, and which the sea did"
10228,CHAPTER I,"not devour, these cannibals thrust through with harpoons, like fishes,"
10229,CHAPTER I,and bore them off to their dire feast. Ulysses with his single bark
10230,CHAPTER I,that had never entered the harbour escaped; that bark which was now
10231,CHAPTER I,the only vessel left of all the gallant navy that had set sail with
10232,CHAPTER I,"him from Troy. He pushed off from the shore, cheering the sad remnant"
10233,CHAPTER I,"of his men, whom horror at the sight of their countrymen's fate had"
10234,CHAPTER I,almost turned to marble.

10246,CHAPTER II,"On went the single ship till it came to the island of Ææa, where Circe"
10247,CHAPTER II,the dreadful daughter of the Sun dwelt. She was deeply skilled in
10248,CHAPTER II,"magic, a haughty beauty, and had hair like the Sun. The Sun was her"

10251,CHAPTER II,
10252,CHAPTER II,"Here a dispute arose among Ulysses's men, which of them should go"
10253,CHAPTER II,ashore and explore the country; for there was a necessity that some
10254,CHAPTER II,"should go to procure water and provisions, their stock of both being"
10255,CHAPTER II,nigh spent: but their hearts failed them when they called to mind the
10256,CHAPTER II,"shocking fate of their fellows whom the Læstrygonians had eaten, and"
10257,CHAPTER II,those which the foul Cyclop Polyphemus had crushed between his jaws;
10258,CHAPTER II,which moved them so tenderly in the recollection that they wept. But
10259,CHAPTER II,"tears never yet supplied any man's wants; this Ulysses knew full well,"
10260,CHAPTER II,"and dividing his men (all that were left) into two companies, at"
10261,CHAPTER II,"the head of one of which was himself, and at the head of the other"
10262,CHAPTER II,"Eurylochus, a man of tried courage, he cast lots which of them should"
10263,CHAPTER II,go up into the country; and the lot fell upon Eurylochus and his
10264,CHAPTER II,"company, two and twenty in number; who took their leave, with tears,"
10265,CHAPTER II,"of Ulysses and his men that staid, whose eyes wore the same wet badges"
10266,CHAPTER II,"of weak humanity, for they surely thought never to see these their"
10267,CHAPTER II,"companions again, but that on every coast where they should come, they"
10268,CHAPTER II,should find nothing but savages and cannibals.
10269,CHAPTER II,
10270,CHAPTER II,"Eurylochus and his party proceeded up the country, till in a dale they"
10271,CHAPTER II,"descried the house of Circe, built of bright stone, by the road's"
10272,CHAPTER II,"side. Before her gate lay many beasts, as wolves, lions, leopards,"
10273,CHAPTER II,"which, by her art, of wild, she had rendered tame. These arose when"
10274,CHAPTER II,"they saw strangers, and ramped upon their hinder paws, and fawned upon"
10275,CHAPTER II,"Eurylochus and his men, who dreaded the effects of such monstrous"
10276,CHAPTER II,"kindness; and staying at the gate they heard the enchantress within,"
10277,CHAPTER II,"sitting at her loom, singing such strains as suspended all mortal"
10278,CHAPTER II,"faculties, while she wove a web, subtle and glorious, and of texture"
10279,CHAPTER II,"inimitable on earth, as all the housewiferies of the deities are."
10280,CHAPTER II,"Strains so ravishingly sweet, provoked even the sagest and prudentest"
10281,CHAPTER II,heads among the party to knock and call at the gate. The shining gate
10282,CHAPTER II,"the enchantress opened, and bad them come in and feast. They unwise"
10283,CHAPTER II,"followed, all but Eurylochus, who staid without the gate, suspicious"
10284,CHAPTER II,"that some train was laid for them. Being entered, she placed them"
10285,CHAPTER II,"in chairs of state, and set before them meal and honey, and Smyrna"
10286,CHAPTER II,wine; but mixed with baneful drugs of powerful enchantment. When they
10287,CHAPTER II,"had eaten of these, and drunk of her cup, she touched them with her"
10288,CHAPTER II,"charming-rod, and straight they were transformed into swine, having"
10289,CHAPTER II,"the bodies of swine, the bristles, and snout, and grunting noise of"
10290,CHAPTER II,"that animal; only they still retained the minds of men, which made"
10291,CHAPTER II,them the more to lament their brutish transformation. Having changed
10292,CHAPTER II,"them, she shut them up in her sty with many more whom her wicked"
10293,CHAPTER II,"sorceries had formerly changed, and gave them swine's food, mast, and"
10294,CHAPTER II,"acorns, and chestnuts, to eat."
10295,CHAPTER II,
10296,CHAPTER II,"Eurylochus, who beheld nothing of these sad changes from where he"
10297,CHAPTER II,"was stationed without the gate, only instead of his companions that"
10298,CHAPTER II,entered (who he thought had all vanished by witchcraft) beheld a herd
10299,CHAPTER II,"of swine, hurried back to the ship, to give an account of what he had"
10300,CHAPTER II,"seen: but so frightened and perplexed, that he could give no distinct"
10301,CHAPTER II,"report of any thing, only he remembered a palace, and a woman singing"
10302,CHAPTER II,"at her work, and gates guarded by lions. But his companions, he said,"
10303,CHAPTER II,were all vanished.
10304,CHAPTER II,
10305,CHAPTER II,"Then Ulysses suspecting some foul witchcraft, snatched his sword, and"
10306,CHAPTER II,"his bow, and commanded Eurylochus instantly to lead him to the place."
10307,CHAPTER II,"But Eurylochus fell down, and embracing his knees, besought him by the"
10308,CHAPTER II,"name of a man whom the gods had in their protection, not to expose his"
10309,CHAPTER II,"safety, and the safety of them all, to certain destruction."
10310,CHAPTER II,
10311,CHAPTER II,"""Do thou then stay, Eurylochus?"" answered Ulysses: ""eat thou and"
10312,CHAPTER II,drink in the ship in safety; while I go alone upon this adventure:
10313,CHAPTER II,"necessity, from whose law is no appeal, compels me."""
10314,CHAPTER II,
10315,CHAPTER II,"So saying he quitted the ship and went on shore, accompanied by none;"
10316,CHAPTER II,none had the hardihood to offer to partake that perilous adventure
10317,CHAPTER II,"with him, so much they dreaded the enchantments of the witch. Singly"
10318,CHAPTER II,he pursued his journey till he came to the shining gates which stood
10319,CHAPTER II,before her mansion: but when he essayed to put his foot over her
10320,CHAPTER II,"threshold, he was suddenly stopt by the apparition of a young man,"
10321,CHAPTER II,"bearing a golden rod in his hand, who was the god Mercury. He held"
10322,CHAPTER II,"Ulysses by the wrist, to stay his entrance; and ""Whither wouldest thou"
10323,CHAPTER II,"go?"" he said, ""O thou most erring of the sons of men! knowest thou"
10324,CHAPTER II,"not that this is the house of great Circe, where she keeps thy friends"
10325,CHAPTER II,"in a loathsome sty, changed from the fair forms of men into the"
10326,CHAPTER II,detestable and ugly shapes of swine? art thou prepared to share their
10327,CHAPTER II,"fate, from which nothing can ransom thee?"" But neither his words, nor"
10328,CHAPTER II,"his coming from heaven, could stop the daring foot of Ulysses, whom"
10329,CHAPTER II,compassion for the misfortune of his friends had rendered careless
10330,CHAPTER II,"of danger: which when the god perceived, he had pity to see valour"
10331,CHAPTER II,"so misplaced, and gave him the flower of the herb _moly_, which is"
10332,CHAPTER II,"sovereign against enchantments. The moly is a small unsightly root,"
10333,CHAPTER II,"its virtues but little known, and in low estimation; the dull shepherd"
10334,CHAPTER II,treads on it every day with his clouted shoes: but it bears a small
10335,CHAPTER II,"white flower, which is medicinal against charms, blights, mildews, and"
10336,CHAPTER II,"damps.--""Take this in thy hand,"" said Mercury, ""and with it boldly"
10337,CHAPTER II,"enter her gates: when she shall strike thee with her rod, thinking to"
10338,CHAPTER II,"change thee, as she has changed thy friends, boldly rush in upon her"
10339,CHAPTER II,"with thy sword, and extort from her the dreadful oath of the gods,"
10340,CHAPTER II,that she will use no enchantments against thee: then force her to
10341,CHAPTER II,"restore thy abused companions."" He gave Ulysses the little white"
10342,CHAPTER II,"flower, and instructing him how to use it, vanished."
10343,CHAPTER II,
10344,CHAPTER II,"When the god was departed, Ulysses with loud knockings beat at the"
10345,CHAPTER II,"gate of the palace. The shining gates were opened, as before, and"
10346,CHAPTER II,great Circe with hospitable cheer invited in her guest. She placed him
10347,CHAPTER II,"on a throne with more distinction than she had used to his fellows,"
10348,CHAPTER II,"she mingled wine in a costly bowl, and he drank of it, mixed with"
10349,CHAPTER II,"those poisonous drugs. When he had drunk, she struck him with her"
10350,CHAPTER II,"charming-rod, and ""To your sty,"" she cried, ""out, swine; mingle with"
10351,CHAPTER II,"your companions."" But those powerful words were not proof against"
10352,CHAPTER II,the preservative which Mercury had given to Ulysses; he remained
10353,CHAPTER II,"unchanged, and as the god had directed him, boldly charged the witch"
10354,CHAPTER II,"with his sword, as if he meant to take her life: which when she saw,"
10355,CHAPTER II,and perceived that her charms were weak against the antidote which
10356,CHAPTER II,"Ulysses bore about him, she cried out and bent her knees beneath his"
10357,CHAPTER II,"sword, embracing his, and said, ""Who or what manner of man art thou?"
10358,CHAPTER II,"Never drank any man before thee of this cup, but he repented it in"
10359,CHAPTER II,some brute's form. Thy shape remains unaltered as thy mind. Thou canst
10360,CHAPTER II,"be none other than Ulysses, renowned above all the world for wisdom,"
10361,CHAPTER II,whom the fates have long since decreed that I must love. This haughty
10362,CHAPTER II,"bosom bends to thee. O Ithacan, a goddess woos thee to her bed."""
10363,CHAPTER II,
10364,CHAPTER II,"""O Circe,"" he replied, ""how canst thou treat of love or marriage with"
10365,CHAPTER II,one whose friends thou hast turned into beasts? and now offerest him
10366,CHAPTER II,"thy hand in wedlock, only that thou mightest have him in thy power, to"
10367,CHAPTER II,"live the life of a beast with thee, naked, effeminate, subject to thy"
10368,CHAPTER II,"will, perhaps to be advanced in time to the honour of a place in thy"
10369,CHAPTER II,"sty. What pleasure canst thou promise, which may tempt the soul of a"
10370,CHAPTER II,"reasonable man? thy meats, spiced with poison; or thy wines, drugged"
10371,CHAPTER II,"with death? Thou must swear to me, that thou wilt never attempt"
10372,CHAPTER II,"against me the treasons which thou hast practised upon my friends."""
10373,CHAPTER II,"The enchantress, won by the terror of his threats, or by the violence"
10374,CHAPTER II,"of that new love which she felt kindling in her veins for him, swore"
10375,CHAPTER II,"by Styx, the great oath of the gods, that she meditated no injury"
10376,CHAPTER II,"to him. Then Ulysses made shew of gentler treatment, which gave her"
10377,CHAPTER II,hopes of inspiring him with a passion equal to that which she felt.
10378,CHAPTER II,"She called her handmaids, four that served her in chief, who were"
10379,CHAPTER II,"daughters to her silver fountains, to her sacred rivers, and to her"
10380,CHAPTER II,"consecrated woods, to deck her apartments, to spread rich carpets, and"
10381,CHAPTER II,"set out her silver tables with dishes of the purest gold, and meat"
10382,CHAPTER II,"as precious as that which the gods eat, to entertain her guest. One"
10383,CHAPTER II,"brought water to wash his feet, and one brought wine to chase away,"
10384,CHAPTER II,"with a refreshing sweetness, the sorrows that had come of late so"
10385,CHAPTER II,"thick upon him, and hurt his noble mind. They strewed perfumes on his"
10386,CHAPTER II,"head, and after he had bathed in a bath of the choicest aromatics,"
10387,CHAPTER II,they brought him rich and costly apparel to put on. Then he was
10388,CHAPTER II,"conducted to a throne of massy silver, and a regale, fit for Jove"
10389,CHAPTER II,"when he banquets, was placed before him. But the feast which Ulysses"
10390,CHAPTER II,desired was to see his friends (the partners of his voyage) once more
10391,CHAPTER II,in the shapes of men; and the food which could give him nourishment
10392,CHAPTER II,"must be taken in at his eyes. Because he missed this sight, he sat"
10393,CHAPTER II,"melancholy and thoughtful, and would taste of none of the rich"
10394,CHAPTER II,"delicacies placed before him. Which when Circe noted, she easily"
10395,CHAPTER II,"divined the cause of his sadness, and leaving the seat in which she"
10396,CHAPTER II,"sat throned, went to her sty, and let abroad his men, who came in like"
10397,CHAPTER II,"swine, and filled the ample hall, where Ulysses sat, with gruntings."
10398,CHAPTER II,Hardly had he time to let his sad eye run over their altered forms and
10399,CHAPTER II,"brutal metamorphosis, when with an ointment which she smeared over"
10400,CHAPTER II,"them, suddenly their bristles fell off, and they started up in their"
10401,CHAPTER II,"own shapes men as before. They knew their leader again, and clung"
10402,CHAPTER II,"about him with joy of their late restoration, and some shame for their"
10403,CHAPTER II,"late change; and wept so loud, blubbering out their joy in broken"
10404,CHAPTER II,"accents, that the palace was filled with a sound of pleasing mourning,"
10405,CHAPTER II,"and the witch herself, great Circe, was not unmoved at the sight. To"
10406,CHAPTER II,"make her atonement complete, she sent for the remnant of Ulysses's"
10407,CHAPTER II,"men who staid behind at the ship, giving up their great commander for"
10408,CHAPTER II,"lost; who when they came, and saw him again alive, circled with their"
10409,CHAPTER II,"fellows, no expression can tell what joy they felt; they even cried"
10410,CHAPTER II,"out with rapture, and to have seen their frantic expressions of mirth,"
10411,CHAPTER II,a man might have supposed that they were just in sight of their
10412,CHAPTER II,"country earth, the cliffs of rocky Ithaca. Only Eurylochus would"
10413,CHAPTER II,"hardly be persuaded to enter that palace of wonders, for he remembered"
10414,CHAPTER II,with a kind of horror how his companions had vanished from his sight.
10415,CHAPTER II,
10416,CHAPTER II,"Then great Circe spake, and gave order, that there should be no more"
10417,CHAPTER II,"sadness among them, nor remembering of past sufferings. For as yet"
10418,CHAPTER II,"they fared like men that are exiles from their country, and if a gleam"
10419,CHAPTER II,"of mirth shot among them, it was suddenly quenched with the thought of"
10420,CHAPTER II,their helpless and homeless condition. Her kind persuasions wrought
10421,CHAPTER II,"upon Ulysses and the rest, that they spent twelve months in all manner"
10422,CHAPTER II,"of delight with her in her palace. For Circe was a powerful magician,"
10423,CHAPTER II,"and could command the moon from her sphere, or unroot the solid oak"
10424,CHAPTER II,"from its place to make it dance for their diversion, and by the help"
10425,CHAPTER II,"of her illusions she could vary the taste of pleasures, and contrive"
10426,CHAPTER II,"delights, recreations, and jolly pastimes, to ""fetch the day about"
10427,CHAPTER II,"from sun to sun, and rock the tedious year as in a delightful dream."""
10428,CHAPTER II,
10429,CHAPTER II,At length Ulysses awoke from the trance of the faculties into which
10430,CHAPTER II,"her charms had thrown him, and the thought of home returned with"
10431,CHAPTER II,tenfold vigour to goad and sting him; that home where he had left his
10432,CHAPTER II,"virtuous wife Penelope, and his young son Telemachus. One day when"
10433,CHAPTER II,"Circe had been lavish of her caresses, and was in her kindest humour,"
10434,CHAPTER II,"he moved to her subtilly, and as it were afar off, the question of his"
10435,CHAPTER II,"home-return; to which she answered firmly, ""O Ulysses, it is not in my"
10436,CHAPTER II,power to detain one whom the gods have destined to further trials. But
10437,CHAPTER II,"leaving me, before you pursue your journey home, you must visit the"
10438,CHAPTER II,"house of Ades, or Death, to consult the shade of Tiresias the Theban"
10439,CHAPTER II,"prophet; to whom alone, of all the dead, Proserpine, queen of hell,"
10440,CHAPTER II,has committed the secret of future events: it is he that must inform
10441,CHAPTER II,"you whether you shall ever see again your wife and country."" ""O"
10442,CHAPTER II,"Circe,"" he cried; ""that is impossible: who shall steer my course to"
10443,CHAPTER II,"Pluto's kingdom? Never ship had strength to make that voyage."" ""Seek"
10444,CHAPTER II,"no guide,"" she replied; ""but raise you your mast, and hoist your white"
10445,CHAPTER II,"sails, and sit in your ship in peace: the north wind shall waft you"
10446,CHAPTER II,"through the seas, till you shall cross the expanse of the ocean, and"
10447,CHAPTER II,"come to where grow the poplar groves, and willows pale, of Proserpine:"
10448,CHAPTER II,where Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus and Acheron mingle their waves.
10449,CHAPTER II,"Cocytus is an arm of Styx, the forgetful river. Here dig a pit, and"
10450,CHAPTER II,"make it a cubit broad and a cubit long, and pour in milk, and honey,"
10451,CHAPTER II,"and wine, and the blood of a ram, and the blood of a black ewe, and"
10452,CHAPTER II,"turn away thy face while thou pourest in, and the dead shall come"
10453,CHAPTER II,flocking to taste the milk and the blood: but suffer none to approach
10454,CHAPTER II,thy offering till thou hast enquired of Tiresias all which thou
10455,CHAPTER II,"wishest to know."""
10456,CHAPTER II,
10457,CHAPTER II,"He did as great Circe had appointed. He raised his mast, and hoisted"
10458,CHAPTER II,"his white sails, and sat in his ship in peace. The north wind wafted"
10459,CHAPTER II,"him through the seas, till he crossed the ocean, and came to the"
10460,CHAPTER II,sacred woods of Proserpine. He stood at the confluence of the three
10461,CHAPTER II,"floods, and digged a pit, as she had given directions, and poured in"
10462,CHAPTER II,"his offering; the blood of a ram, and the blood of a black ewe, milk,"
10463,CHAPTER II,"and honey, and wine; and the dead came to his banquet: aged men, and"
10464,CHAPTER II,"women, and youths, and children who died in infancy. But none of them"
10465,CHAPTER II,"would he suffer to approach, and dip their thin lips in the offering,"
10466,CHAPTER II,"till Tiresias was served, not though his own mother was among the"
10467,CHAPTER II,"number, whom now for the first time he knew to be dead, for he had"
10468,CHAPTER II,"left her living when he went to Troy, and she had died since his"
10469,CHAPTER II,"departure, and the tidings never reached him: though it irked his soul"
10470,CHAPTER II,"to use constraint upon her, yet in compliance with the injunction of"
10471,CHAPTER II,"great Circe, he forced her to retire along with the other ghosts. Then"
10472,CHAPTER II,"Tiresias, who bore a golden sceptre, came and lapped of the offering,"
10473,CHAPTER II,"and immediately he knew Ulysses, and began to prophesy: _he denounced"
10474,CHAPTER II,"woe to Ulysses, woe, woe, and many sufferings, through the anger of"
10475,CHAPTER II,Neptune for the putting out of the eye of the sea-god's son. Yet there
10476,CHAPTER II,"was safety after suffering, if they could abstain from slaughtering"
10477,CHAPTER II,the oxen of the Sun after they landed in the Triangular island. For
10478,CHAPTER II,"Ulysses, the gods had destined him from a king to become a beggar, and"
10479,CHAPTER II,"to perish by his own guests, unless he slew those who knew him not._"
10480,CHAPTER II,
10481,CHAPTER II,"This prophecy, ambiguously delivered, was all that Tiresias was"
10482,CHAPTER II,"empowered to unfold, or else there was no longer place for him;"
10483,CHAPTER II,"for now the souls of the other dead came flocking in such numbers,"
10484,CHAPTER II,"tumultuously demanding the blood, that freezing horror seized the"
10485,CHAPTER II,"limbs of the living Ulysses, to see so many, and all dead, and he the"
10486,CHAPTER II,only one alive in that region. Now his mother came and lapped the
10487,CHAPTER II,"blood, without restraint from her son, and now she knew him to be her"
10488,CHAPTER II,"son, and enquired of him why he had come alive to their comfortless"
10489,CHAPTER II,"habitations. And she said, that affliction for Ulysses's long absence"
10490,CHAPTER II,"had preyed upon her spirits, and brought her to the grave."
10491,CHAPTER II,
10492,CHAPTER II,"Ulysses's soul melted at her moving narration, and forgetting the"
10493,CHAPTER II,"state of the dead, and that the airy texture of disembodied spirits"
10494,CHAPTER II,"does not admit of the embraces of flesh and blood, he threw his arms"
10495,CHAPTER II,"about her to clasp her: the poor ghost melted from his embrace, and"
10496,CHAPTER II,looking mournfully upon him vanished away.
10497,CHAPTER II,
10498,CHAPTER II,"Then saw he other females.--Tyro, who when she lived was the paramour"
10499,CHAPTER II,"of Neptune, and by him had Pelias, and Neleus. Antiope, who bore"
10500,CHAPTER II,"two like sons to Jove, Amphion and Zethus, founders of Thebes."
10501,CHAPTER II,"Alcmena, the mother of Hercules, with her fair daughter, afterwards"
10502,CHAPTER II,"her daughter-in-law, Megara. There also Ulysses saw Jocasta, the"
10503,CHAPTER II,unfortunate mother and wife of Oedipus; who ignorant of kin wedded
10504,CHAPTER II,"with her son, and when she had discovered the unnatural alliance, for"
10505,CHAPTER II,shame and grief hanged herself. He continued to drag a wretched life
10506,CHAPTER II,"above the earth, haunted by the dreadful Furies.--There was Leda,"
10507,CHAPTER II,"the wife of Tyndarus, the mother of the beautiful Helen, and of the"
10508,CHAPTER II,"two brave brothers, Castor and Pollux, who obtained this grace from"
10509,CHAPTER II,"Jove, that being dead, they should enjoy life alternately, living"
10510,CHAPTER II,in pleasant places under the earth. For Pollux had prayed that his
10511,CHAPTER II,"brother Castor, who was subject to death, as the son of Tyndarus,"
10512,CHAPTER II,"should partake of his own immortality, which he derived from an"
10513,CHAPTER II,immortal sire: this the Fates denied; therefore Pollux was permitted
10514,CHAPTER II,"to divide his immortality with his brother Castor, dying and living"
10515,CHAPTER II,"alternately.--There was Iphimedeia, who bore two sons to Neptune"
10516,CHAPTER II,"that were giants, Otus and Ephialtes: Earth in her prodigality"
10517,CHAPTER II,never nourished bodies to such portentous size and beauty as these
10518,CHAPTER II,"two children were of, except Orion. At nine years old they had"
10519,CHAPTER II,imaginations of climbing to Heaven to see what the gods were doing;
10520,CHAPTER II,"they thought to make stairs of mountains, and were for piling Ossa"
10521,CHAPTER II,"upon Olympus, and setting Pelion upon that, and had perhaps performed"
10522,CHAPTER II,"it, if they had lived till they were striplings; but they were cut off"
10523,CHAPTER II,"by death in the infancy of their ambitious project.--Phædra was there,"
10524,CHAPTER II,"and Procris, and Ariadne, mournful for Theseus's desertion, and Mæra,"
10525,CHAPTER II,"and Clymene, and Eryphile, who preferred gold before wedlock faith."
10526,CHAPTER II,
10527,CHAPTER II,"But now came a mournful ghost, that late was Agamemnon, son of Atreus,"
10528,CHAPTER II,the mighty leader of all the host of Greece and their confederate
10529,CHAPTER II,kings that warred against Troy. He came with the rest to sip a little
10530,CHAPTER II,of the blood at that uncomfortable banquet. Ulysses was moved with
10531,CHAPTER II,"compassion to see him among them, and asked him what untimely fate had"
10532,CHAPTER II,"brought him there, if storms had overwhelmed him coming from Troy, or"
10533,CHAPTER II,if he had perished in some mutiny by his own soldiers at a division of
10534,CHAPTER II,the prey.
10535,CHAPTER II,
10536,CHAPTER II,"""By none of these,"" he replied, ""did I come to my death; but slain at"
10537,CHAPTER II,a banquet to which I was invited by Ægisthus after my return home.
10538,CHAPTER II,"He conspiring with my adulterous wife, they laid a scheme for my"
10539,CHAPTER II,"destruction, training me forth to a banquet as an ox goes to the"
10540,CHAPTER II,"slaughter, and there surrounding me they slew me with all my friends"
10541,CHAPTER II,about me.
10542,CHAPTER II,
10543,CHAPTER II,"""Clytemnestra, my wicked wife, forgetting the vows which she swore to"
10544,CHAPTER II,"me in wedlock, would not lend a hand to close my eyes in death. But"
10545,CHAPTER II,"nothing is so heaped with impieties as such a woman, who would kill"
10546,CHAPTER II,her spouse that married her a maid. When I brought her home to my
10547,CHAPTER II,"house a bride, I hoped in my heart that she would be loving to me and"
10548,CHAPTER II,"to my children. Now, her black treacheries have cast a foul aspersion"
10549,CHAPTER II,on her whole sex. Blest husbands will have their loving wives in
10550,CHAPTER II,"suspicion for her bad deeds."""
10551,CHAPTER II,
10552,CHAPTER II,"""Alas!"" said Ulysses, ""there seems to be a fatality in your royal"
10553,CHAPTER II,"house of Atreus, and that they are hated of Jove for their wives. For"
10554,CHAPTER II,"Helen's sake, your brother Menelaus's wife, what multitudes fell in"
10555,CHAPTER II,"the wars of Troy!"""
10556,CHAPTER II,
10557,CHAPTER II,"Agamemnon replied, ""For this cause be not thou more kind than wise to"
10558,CHAPTER II,any woman. Let not thy words express to her at any time all that is in
10559,CHAPTER II,"thy mind, keep still some secrets to thyself. But thou by any bloody"
10560,CHAPTER II,contrivances of thy wife never needst fear to fall. Exceeding wise
10561,CHAPTER II,"she is, and to her wisdom she has a goodness as eminent; Icarius's"
10562,CHAPTER II,"daughter, Penelope the chaste: we left her a young bride when we"
10563,CHAPTER II,"parted from our wives to go to the wars, her first child suckling"
10564,CHAPTER II,"at her breast, the young Telemachus, whom you shall see grown up to"
10565,CHAPTER II,"manhood on your return, and he shall greet his father with befitting"
10566,CHAPTER II,"welcomes. My Orestes, my dear son, I shall never see again. His mother"
10567,CHAPTER II,"has deprived his father of the sight of him, and perhaps will slay him"
10568,CHAPTER II,as she slew his sire. It is now no world to trust a woman in.--But
10569,CHAPTER II,"what says fame? is my son yet alive? lives he in Orchomen, or in"
10570,CHAPTER II,"Pylus, or is he resident in Sparta, in his uncle's court? as yet, I"
10571,CHAPTER II,"see, divine Orestes is not here with me."""
10572,CHAPTER II,
10573,CHAPTER II,To this Ulysses replied that he had received no certain tidings where
10574,CHAPTER II,"Orestes abode, only some uncertain rumours which he could not report"
10575,CHAPTER II,for truth.
10576,CHAPTER II,
10577,CHAPTER II,"While they held this sad conference, with kind tears striving to"
10578,CHAPTER II,"render unkind fortunes more palatable, the soul of great Achilles"
10579,CHAPTER II,"joined them. ""What desperate adventure has brought Ulysses to these"
10580,CHAPTER II,"regions,"" said Achilles, ""to see the end of dead men, and their"
10581,CHAPTER II,"foolish shades?"""
10582,CHAPTER II,
10583,CHAPTER II,Ulysses answered him that he had come to consult Tiresias respecting
10584,CHAPTER II,"his voyage home. ""But thou, O son of Thetis,"" said he, ""why dost thou"
10585,CHAPTER II,disparage the state of the dead? seeing that as alive thou didst
10586,CHAPTER II,"surpass all men in glory, thou must needs retain thy pre-eminence here"
10587,CHAPTER II,"below: so great Achilles triumphs over death."""
10588,CHAPTER II,
10589,CHAPTER II,"But Achilles made reply, that he had much rather be a peasant-slave"
10590,CHAPTER II,"upon the earth, than reign over all the dead. So much did the"
10591,CHAPTER II,inactivity and slothful condition of that state displease his
10592,CHAPTER II,unquenchable and restless spirit. Only he enquired of Ulysses if his
10593,CHAPTER II,"father Peleus were living, and how his son Neoptolemus conducted"
10594,CHAPTER II,himself.
10595,CHAPTER II,
10596,CHAPTER II,Of Peleus Ulysses could tell him nothing; but of Neoptolemus he thus
10597,CHAPTER II,"bore witness: ""From Scyros I convoyed your son by sea to the Greeks:"
10598,CHAPTER II,"where I can speak of him, for I knew him. He was chief in council, and"
10599,CHAPTER II,"in the field. When any question was proposed, so quick was his conceit"
10600,CHAPTER II,"in the forward apprehension of any case, that he ever spoke first,"
10601,CHAPTER II,and was heard with more attention than the older heads. Only myself
10602,CHAPTER II,and aged Nestor could compare with him in giving advice. In battle I
10603,CHAPTER II,"cannot speak his praise, unless I could count all that fell by his"
10604,CHAPTER II,sword. I will only mention one instance of his manhood. When we sat
10605,CHAPTER II,"hid in the belly of the wooden horse, in the ambush which deceived"
10606,CHAPTER II,"the Trojans to their destruction, I, who had the management of that"
10607,CHAPTER II,"stratagem, still shifted my place from side to side to note the"
10608,CHAPTER II,"behaviour of our men. In some I marked their hearts trembling, through"
10609,CHAPTER II,"all the pains which they took to appear valiant, and in others tears,"
10610,CHAPTER II,"that in spite of manly courage would gush forth. And to say truth, it"
10611,CHAPTER II,"was an adventure of high enterprise, and as perilous a stake as was"
10612,CHAPTER II,ever played in war's game. But in him I could not observe the least
10613,CHAPTER II,"sign of weakness, no tears nor tremblings, but his hand still on his"
10614,CHAPTER II,"good sword, and ever urging me to set open the machine and let us out"
10615,CHAPTER II,before the time was come for doing it; and when we sallied out he was
10616,CHAPTER II,still first in that fierce destruction and bloody midnight desolation
10617,CHAPTER II,"of king Priam's city."""
10618,CHAPTER II,
10619,CHAPTER II,"This made the soul of Achilles to tread a swifter pace, with"
10620,CHAPTER II,"high-raised feet, as he vanished away, for the joy which he took in"
10621,CHAPTER II,his son being applauded by Ulysses.
10622,CHAPTER II,
10623,CHAPTER II,"A sad shade stalked by, which Ulysses knew to be the ghost of Ajax,"
10624,CHAPTER II,"his opponent, when living, in that famous dispute about the right of"
10625,CHAPTER II,succeeding to the arms of the deceased Achilles. They being adjudged
10626,CHAPTER II,"by the Greeks to Ulysses, as the prize of wisdom above bodily"
10627,CHAPTER II,"strength, the noble Ajax in despite went mad, and slew himself. The"
10628,CHAPTER II,"sight of his rival turned to a shade by his dispute, so subdued the"
10629,CHAPTER II,"passion of emulation in Ulysses, that for his sake he wished that"
10630,CHAPTER II,"judgment in that controversy had been given against himself, rather"
10631,CHAPTER II,than so illustrious a chief should have perished for the desire of
10632,CHAPTER II,"those arms, which his prowess (second only to Achilles in fight) so"
10633,CHAPTER II,"eminently had deserved. ""Ajax,"" he cried, ""all the Greeks mourn for"
10634,CHAPTER II,thee as much as they lamented for Achilles. Let not thy wrath burn for
10635,CHAPTER II,"ever, great son of Telamon. Ulysses seeks peace with thee, and will"
10636,CHAPTER II,"make any atonement to thee that can appease thy hurt spirit."" But the"
10637,CHAPTER II,"shade stalked on, and would not exchange a word with Ulysses, though"
10638,CHAPTER II,"he prayed it with many tears and many earnest entreaties. ""He might"
10639,CHAPTER II,"have spoke to me,"" said Ulysses, ""since I spoke to him; but I see the"
10640,CHAPTER II,"resentments of the dead are eternal."""
10641,CHAPTER II,
10642,CHAPTER II,Then Ulysses saw a throne on which was placed a judge distributing
10643,CHAPTER II,"sentence. He that sat on the throne was Minos, and he was dealing out"
10644,CHAPTER II,just judgments to the dead. He it is that assigns them their place in
10645,CHAPTER II,bliss or woe.
10646,CHAPTER II,
10647,CHAPTER II,"Then came by a thundering ghost, the large-limbed Orion, the mighty"
10648,CHAPTER II,"hunter, who was hunting there the ghosts of the beasts which he had"
10649,CHAPTER II,slaughtered in desart hills upon the earth. For the dead delight in
10650,CHAPTER II,the occupations which pleased them in the time of their living upon
10651,CHAPTER II,the earth.
10652,CHAPTER II,
10653,CHAPTER II,There was Tityus suffering eternal pains because he had sought to
10654,CHAPTER II,violate the honour of Latona as she passed from Pytho into Panopeus.
10655,CHAPTER II,Two vultures sat perpetually preying upon his liver with their crooked
10656,CHAPTER II,"beaks; which as fast as they devoured, is for ever renewed; nor can he"
10657,CHAPTER II,fray them away with his great hands.
10658,CHAPTER II,
10659,CHAPTER II,"There was Tantalus, plagued for his great sins, standing up to the"
10660,CHAPTER II,"chin in water, which he can never taste, but still as he bows his"
10661,CHAPTER II,"head, thinking to quench his burning thirst, instead of water he licks"
10662,CHAPTER II,"up unsavoury dust. All fruits pleasant to the sight, and of delicious"
10663,CHAPTER II,"flavour, hang in ripe clusters about his head, seeming as though they"
10664,CHAPTER II,offered themselves to be plucked by him; but when he reaches out his
10665,CHAPTER II,"hand, some wind carries them far out of his sight into the clouds: so"
10666,CHAPTER II,"he is starved in the midst of plenty by the righteous doom of Jove, in"
10667,CHAPTER II,"memory of that inhuman banquet at which the sun turned pale, when the"
10668,CHAPTER II,"unnatural father served up the limbs of his little son in a dish, as"
10669,CHAPTER II,meat for his divine guests.
10670,CHAPTER II,
10671,CHAPTER II,"There was Sisyphus, that sees no end to his labours. His punishment"
10672,CHAPTER II,"is, to be for ever rolling up a vast stone to the top of a mountain,"
10673,CHAPTER II,"which when it gets to the top, falls down with a crushing weight, and"
10674,CHAPTER II,"all his work is to be begun again. He was bathed all over in sweat,"
10675,CHAPTER II,that reeked out a smoke which covered his head like a mist. His crime
10676,CHAPTER II,had been the revealing of state secrets.
10677,CHAPTER II,
10678,CHAPTER II,There Ulysses saw Hercules: not that Hercules who enjoys immortal life
10679,CHAPTER II,"in heaven among the gods, and is married to Hebe or Youth; but his"
10680,CHAPTER II,shadow which remains below. About him the dead flocked as thick as
10681,CHAPTER II,"bats, hovering around, and cuffing at his head: he stands with his"
10682,CHAPTER II,"dreadful bow, ever in the act to shoot."
10683,CHAPTER II,
10684,CHAPTER II,There also might Ulysses have seen and spoken with the shades of
10685,CHAPTER II,"Theseus, and Pirithous, and the old heroes; but he had conversed"
10686,CHAPTER II,"enough with horrors: therefore covering his face with his hands, that"
10687,CHAPTER II,"he might see no more spectres, he resumed his seat in his ship, and"
10688,CHAPTER II,"pushed off. The bark moved of itself without the help of any oar,"
10689,CHAPTER II,and soon brought him out of the regions of death into the cheerful
10690,CHAPTER II,"quarters of the living, and to the island of Ææa, whence he had set"
10691,CHAPTER II,forth.

10703,CHAPTER III,"""Unhappy man, who at thy birth wast appointed twice to die! others"
10704,CHAPTER III,"shall die once; but thou, besides that death that remains for thee,"

10706,CHAPTER III,"Thee Scylla, thee Charybdis, expect. Thee the deathful Sirens lie in"
10707,CHAPTER III,"wait for, that taint the minds of whoever listen to them with their"
10708,CHAPTER III,"sweet singing. Whosoever shall but hear the call of any Siren, he will"

10710,CHAPTER III,"stream of his affection never again shall set homewards, nor shall he"
10711,CHAPTER III,"take joy in wife or children thereafter, or they in him."""
10712,CHAPTER III,
10713,CHAPTER III,With these prophetic greetings great Circe met Ulysses on his return.
10714,CHAPTER III,"He besought her to instruct him in the nature of the Sirens, and by"
10715,CHAPTER III,what method their baneful allurements were to be resisted.
10716,CHAPTER III,
10717,CHAPTER III,"""They are sisters three,"" she replied, ""that sit in a mead (by which"
10718,CHAPTER III,your ship must needs pass) circled with dead men's bones. These are
10719,CHAPTER III,"the bones of men whom they have slain, after with fawning invitements"
10720,CHAPTER III,they have enticed them into their fen. Yet such is the celestial
10721,CHAPTER III,harmony of their voice accompanying the persuasive magic of their
10722,CHAPTER III,"words, that knowing this, you shall not be able to withstand their"
10723,CHAPTER III,"enticements. Therefore when you are to sail by them, you shall stop"
10724,CHAPTER III,"the ears of your companions with wax, that they may hear no note of"
10725,CHAPTER III,"that dangerous music; but for yourself, that you may hear, and yet"
10726,CHAPTER III,"live, give them strict command to bind you hand and foot to the mast,"
10727,CHAPTER III,"and in no case to set you free, till you are out of the danger of the"
10728,CHAPTER III,"temptation, though you should entreat it, and implore it ever so much,"
10729,CHAPTER III,but to bind you rather the more for your requesting to be loosed. So
10730,CHAPTER III,"shall you escape that snare."""
10731,CHAPTER III,
10732,CHAPTER III,Ulysses then prayed her that she would inform him what Scylla and
10733,CHAPTER III,"Charybdis were, which she had taught him by name to fear. She replied:"
10734,CHAPTER III,"""Sailing from Ææa to Trinacria, you must pass at an equal distance"
10735,CHAPTER III,between two fatal rocks. Incline never so little either to the one
10736,CHAPTER III,"side or the other, and your ship must meet with certain destruction."
10737,CHAPTER III,"No vessel ever yet tried that pass without being lost, but the Argo,"
10738,CHAPTER III,"which owed her safety to the sacred freight she bore, the fleece of"
10739,CHAPTER III,"the golden-backed ram, which could not perish. The biggest of these"
10740,CHAPTER III,"rocks which you shall come to, Scylla hath in charge. There in a deep"
10741,CHAPTER III,whirlpool at the foot of the rock the abhorred monster shrouds her
10742,CHAPTER III,"face; who if she were to shew her full form, no eye of man or god"
10743,CHAPTER III,could endure the sight: thence she stretches out all her six long
10744,CHAPTER III,"necks peering and diving to suck up fish, dolphins, dog-fish, and"
10745,CHAPTER III,"whales, whole ships, and their men, whatever comes within her raging"
10746,CHAPTER III,"gulf. The other rock is lesser, and of less ominous aspect; but there"
10747,CHAPTER III,"dreadful Charybdis sits, supping the black deeps. Thrice a day she"
10748,CHAPTER III,"drinks her pits dry, and thrice a day again she belches them all up:"
10749,CHAPTER III,"but when she is drinking, come not nigh, for being once caught, the"
10750,CHAPTER III,force of Neptune cannot redeem you from her swallow. Better trust to
10751,CHAPTER III,"Scylla, for she will but have for her six necks six men: Charybdis in"
10752,CHAPTER III,"her insatiate draught will ask all."""
10753,CHAPTER III,
10754,CHAPTER III,"Then Ulysses enquired, in case he should escape Charybdis, whether"
10755,CHAPTER III,he might not assail that other monster with his sword: to which she
10756,CHAPTER III,"replied that he must not think that he had an enemy subject to death,"
10757,CHAPTER III,"or wounds, to contend with: for Scylla could never die. Therefore,"
10758,CHAPTER III,"his best safety was in flight, and to invoke none of the gods but"
10759,CHAPTER III,"Cratis, who is Scylla's mother, and might perhaps forbid her daughter"
10760,CHAPTER III,to devour them. For his conduct after he arrived at Trinacria she
10761,CHAPTER III,referred him to the admonitions which had been given him by Tiresias.
10762,CHAPTER III,
10763,CHAPTER III,"Ulysses having communicated her instructions, as far as related to the"
10764,CHAPTER III,"Sirens, to his companions, who had not been present at that interview;"
10765,CHAPTER III,"but concealing from them the rest, as he had done the terrible"
10766,CHAPTER III,"predictions of Tiresias, that they might not be deterred by fear from"
10767,CHAPTER III,"pursuing their voyage: the time for departure being come, they set"
10768,CHAPTER III,"their sails, and took a final leave of great Circe; who by her art"
10769,CHAPTER III,"calmed the heavens, and gave them smooth seas, and a right fore wind"
10770,CHAPTER III,(the seaman's friend) to bear them on their way to Ithaca.
10771,CHAPTER III,
10772,CHAPTER III,They had not sailed past a hundred leagues before the breeze which
10773,CHAPTER III,Circe had lent them suddenly stopped. It was stricken dead. All the
10774,CHAPTER III,sea lay in prostrate slumber. Not a gasp of air could be felt. The
10775,CHAPTER III,ship stood still. Ulysses guessed that the island of the Sirens was
10776,CHAPTER III,"not far off, and that they had charmed the air so with their devilish"
10777,CHAPTER III,"singing. Therefore he made him cakes of wax, as Circe had instructed"
10778,CHAPTER III,"him, and stopped the ears of his men with them: then causing himself"
10779,CHAPTER III,"to be bound hand and foot, he commanded the rowers to ply their oars"
10780,CHAPTER III,and row as fast as speed could carry them past that fatal shore. They
10781,CHAPTER III,"soon came within sight of the Sirens, who sang in Ulysses' hearing:"
10782,CHAPTER III,
10783,CHAPTER III,"Come here, thou, worthy of a world of praise,"
10784,CHAPTER III,That dost so high the Grecian glory raise;
10785,CHAPTER III,Ulysses! stay thy ship; and that song hear
10786,CHAPTER III,"That none past ever, but it bent his ear,"
10787,CHAPTER III,"But left him ravish'd, and instructed more"
10788,CHAPTER III,"By us, than any, ever heard before."
10789,CHAPTER III,"For we know all things, whatsoever were"
10790,CHAPTER III,In wide Troy labour'd; whatsoever there
10791,CHAPTER III,The Grecians and the Trojans both sustain'd:
10792,CHAPTER III,By those high issues that the gods ordain'd:
10793,CHAPTER III,And whatsoever all the earth can show
10794,CHAPTER III,"To inform a knowledge of desert, we know."
10795,CHAPTER III,
10796,CHAPTER III,"These were the words, but the celestial harmony of the voices which"
10797,CHAPTER III,sang them no tongue can describe: it took the ear of Ulysses with
10798,CHAPTER III,ravishment. He would have broke his bonds to rush after them; and
10799,CHAPTER III,"threatened, wept, sued, entreated, commanded, crying out with tears"
10800,CHAPTER III,"and passionate imprecations, conjuring his men by all the ties of"
10801,CHAPTER III,"perils past which they had endured in common, by fellowship and love,"
10802,CHAPTER III,"and the authority which he retained among them, to let him loose; but"
10803,CHAPTER III,at no rate would they obey him. And still the Sirens sang. Ulysses
10804,CHAPTER III,"made signs, motions, gestures, promising mountains of gold if they"
10805,CHAPTER III,would set him free; but their oars only moved faster. And still the
10806,CHAPTER III,"Sirens sung. And still the more he adjured them to set him free, the"
10807,CHAPTER III,faster with cords and ropes they bound him; till they were quite out
10808,CHAPTER III,"of hearing of the Sirens' notes, whose effect great Circe had so truly"
10809,CHAPTER III,"predicted. And well she might speak of them, for often she had joined"
10810,CHAPTER III,"her own enchanting voice to theirs, while she has sat in the flowery"
10811,CHAPTER III,"meads, mingled with the Sirens and the Water Nymphs, gathering their"
10812,CHAPTER III,potent herbs and drugs of magic quality: their singing altogether has
10813,CHAPTER III,"made the gods stoop, and ""heaven drowsy with the harmony."""
10814,CHAPTER III,
10815,CHAPTER III,"Escaped that peril, they had not sailed yet an hundred leagues"
10816,CHAPTER III,"further, when they heard a roar afar off, which Ulysses knew to be"
10817,CHAPTER III,"the barking of Scylla's dogs, which surround her waist, and bark"
10818,CHAPTER III,"incessantly. Coming nearer they beheld a smoke ascend, with a horrid"
10819,CHAPTER III,"murmur, which arose from that other whirlpool, to which they made"
10820,CHAPTER III,"nigher approaches than to Scylla. Through the furious eddy, which is"
10821,CHAPTER III,"in that place, the ship stood still as a stone, for there was no man"
10822,CHAPTER III,"to lend his hand to an oar, the dismal roar of Scylla's dogs at a"
10823,CHAPTER III,"distance, and the nearer clamours of Charybdis, where everything made"
10824,CHAPTER III,"an echo, quite taking from them the power of exertion. Ulysses went"
10825,CHAPTER III,"up and down encouraging his men, one by one, giving them good words,"
10826,CHAPTER III,telling them that they were in greater perils when they were blocked
10827,CHAPTER III,"up in the Cyclop's cave, yet, heaven assisting his counsels, he had"
10828,CHAPTER III,delivered them out of that extremity. That he could not believe but
10829,CHAPTER III,they remembered it; and wished them to give the same trust to the same
10830,CHAPTER III,care which he had now for their welfare. That they must exert all
10831,CHAPTER III,"the strength and wit which they had, and try if Jove would not grant"
10832,CHAPTER III,them an escape even out of this peril. In particular he cheered up
10833,CHAPTER III,"the pilot who sat at the helm, and told him that he must shew more"
10834,CHAPTER III,"firmness than other men, as he had more trust committed to him, and"
10835,CHAPTER III,had the sole management by his skill of the vessel in which all their
10836,CHAPTER III,safeties were embarked. That a rock lay hid within those boiling
10837,CHAPTER III,"whirlpools which he saw, on the outside of which he must steer, if he"
10838,CHAPTER III,"would avoid his own destruction, and the destruction of them all."
10839,CHAPTER III,
10840,CHAPTER III,"They heard him, and like men took to the oars; but little knew what"
10841,CHAPTER III,"opposite danger, in shunning that rock, they must be thrown upon. For"
10842,CHAPTER III,"Ulysses had concealed from them the wounds, never to be healed, which"
10843,CHAPTER III,Scylla was to open: their terror would else have robbed them all of
10844,CHAPTER III,"all care to steer, or move an oar, and have made them hide under the"
10845,CHAPTER III,"hatches, for fear of seeing her, where he and they must have died an"
10846,CHAPTER III,idle death. But even then he forgot the precautions which Circe had
10847,CHAPTER III,given him to prevent harm to his person; who had willed him not to
10848,CHAPTER III,"arm, or shew himself once to Scylla: but disdaining not to venture"
10849,CHAPTER III,"life for his brave companions, he could not contain, but armed in all"
10850,CHAPTER III,"points, and taking a lance in either hand, he went up to the fore"
10851,CHAPTER III,"deck, and looked when Scylla would appear."
10852,CHAPTER III,
10853,CHAPTER III,"She did not shew herself as yet, and still the vessel steered closer"
10854,CHAPTER III,"by her rock, as it sought to shun that other more dreaded: for they"
10855,CHAPTER III,saw how horribly Charybdis's black throat drew into her all the
10856,CHAPTER III,"whirling deep, which she disgorged again, that all about her boiled"
10857,CHAPTER III,"like a kettle, and the rock roared with troubled waters; which when"
10858,CHAPTER III,"she supped in again, all the bottom turned up, and disclosed far"
10859,CHAPTER III,"under shore the swart sands naked, whose whole stern sight frayed the"
10860,CHAPTER III,"startled blood from their faces, and made Ulysses turn his to view"
10861,CHAPTER III,"the wonder of whirlpools. Which when Scylla saw, from out her black"
10862,CHAPTER III,"den, she darted out her six long necks, and swoopt up as many of his"
10863,CHAPTER III,"friends: whose cries Ulysses heard, and saw them too late, with their"
10864,CHAPTER III,"heels turned up, and their hands thrown to him for succour, who had"
10865,CHAPTER III,"been their help in all extremities, but could not deliver them now;"
10866,CHAPTER III,"and he heard them shriek out, as she tore them, and to the last they"
10867,CHAPTER III,continued to throw their hands out to him for sweet life. In all his
10868,CHAPTER III,sufferings he never had beheld a sight so full of miseries.
10869,CHAPTER III,
10870,CHAPTER III,"Escaped from Scylla and Charybdis, but with a diminished crew, Ulysses"
10871,CHAPTER III,and the sad remains of his followers reached the Trinacrian shore.
10872,CHAPTER III,"Here landing, he beheld oxen grazing of such surpassing size and"
10873,CHAPTER III,"beauty, that both from them, and from the shape of the island (having"
10874,CHAPTER III,three promontories jutting into the sea) he judged rightly that he
10875,CHAPTER III,"was come to the Triangular island, and the oxen of the Sun, of which"
10876,CHAPTER III,Tiresias had forewarned him.
10877,CHAPTER III,
10878,CHAPTER III,"So great was his terror lest through his own fault, or that of his"
10879,CHAPTER III,"men, any violence or profanation should be offered to the holy oxen,"
10880,CHAPTER III,"that even then, tired as they were with the perils and fatigues of"
10881,CHAPTER III,"the day past, and unable to stir an oar, or use any exertion, and"
10882,CHAPTER III,"though night was fast coming on, he would have had them re-embark"
10883,CHAPTER III,"immediately, and make the best of their way from that dangerous"
10884,CHAPTER III,"station; but his men with one voice resolutely opposed it, and even"
10885,CHAPTER III,the too cautious Eurylochus himself withstood the proposal; so much
10886,CHAPTER III,did the temptation of a little ease and refreshment (ease tenfold
10887,CHAPTER III,"sweet after such labours) prevail over the sagest counsels, and the"
10888,CHAPTER III,apprehension of certain evil outweigh the prospect of contingent
10889,CHAPTER III,"danger. They expostulated, that the nerves of Ulysses seemed to be"
10890,CHAPTER III,"made of steel, and his limbs not liable to lassitude like other men's;"
10891,CHAPTER III,that waking or sleeping seemed indifferent to him; but that they were
10892,CHAPTER III,"men, not gods, and felt the common appetites for food and sleep."
10893,CHAPTER III,That in the nighttime all the winds most destructive to ships are
10894,CHAPTER III,"generated. That black night still required to be served with meat,"
10895,CHAPTER III,"and sleep, and quiet havens, and ease. That the best sacrifice"
10896,CHAPTER III,to the sea was in the morning. With such sailor-like sayings and
10897,CHAPTER III,"mutinous arguments, which the majority have always ready to justify"
10898,CHAPTER III,"disobedience to their betters, they forced Ulysses to comply with"
10899,CHAPTER III,"their requisition, and against his will to take up his night-quarters"
10900,CHAPTER III,on shore. But he first exacted from them an oath that they would
10901,CHAPTER III,"neither maim nor kill any of the cattle which they saw grazing, but"
10902,CHAPTER III,content themselves with such food as Circe had stowed their vessel
10903,CHAPTER III,with when they parted from Ææa. This they man by man severally
10904,CHAPTER III,"promised, imprecating the heaviest curses on whoever should break it;"
10905,CHAPTER III,"and mooring their bark within a creek, they went to supper, contenting"
10906,CHAPTER III,"themselves that night with such food as Circe had given them, not"
10907,CHAPTER III,"without many sad thoughts of their friends whom Scylla had devoured,"
10908,CHAPTER III,the grief of which kept them great part of the night waking.
10909,CHAPTER III,
10910,CHAPTER III,In the morning Ulysses urged them again to a religious observance of
10911,CHAPTER III,"the oath that they had sworn, not in any case to attempt the blood of"
10912,CHAPTER III,"those fair herds which they saw grazing, but to content themselves"
10913,CHAPTER III,with the ship's food; for the god who owned those cattle sees and
10914,CHAPTER III,hears all.
10915,CHAPTER III,
10916,CHAPTER III,"They faithfully obeyed, and remained in that good mind for a month,"
10917,CHAPTER III,"during which they were confined to that station by contrary winds,"
10918,CHAPTER III,"till all the wine and the bread was gone, which they had brought with"
10919,CHAPTER III,"them. When their victuals were gone, necessity compelled them to stray"
10920,CHAPTER III,"in quest of whatever fish or fowl they could snare, which that coast"
10921,CHAPTER III,did not yield in any great abundance. Then Ulysses prayed to all the
10922,CHAPTER III,"gods that dwelt in bountiful heaven, that they would be pleased to"
10923,CHAPTER III,yield them some means to stay their hunger without having recourse to
10924,CHAPTER III,profane and forbidden violations: but the ears of heaven seemed to be
10925,CHAPTER III,"shut, or some god incensed plotted his ruin; for at mid-day, when he"
10926,CHAPTER III,"should chiefly have been vigilant and watchful to prevent mischief, a"
10927,CHAPTER III,"deep sleep fell upon the eyes of Ulysses, during which he lay totally"
10928,CHAPTER III,"insensible of all that passed in the world, and what his friends"
10929,CHAPTER III,or what his enemies might do for his welfare or destruction. Then
10930,CHAPTER III,Eurylochus took his advantage. He was the man of most authority with
10931,CHAPTER III,them after Ulysses. He represented to them all the misery of their
10932,CHAPTER III,"condition; how that every death is hateful and grievous to mortality,"
10933,CHAPTER III,"but that of all deaths famine is attended with the most painful,"
10934,CHAPTER III,"loathsome, and humiliating circumstances; that the subsistence which"
10935,CHAPTER III,they could hope to draw from fowling or fishing was too precarious
10936,CHAPTER III,to be depended upon; that there did not seem to be any chance of the
10937,CHAPTER III,"winds changing to favour their escape, but that they must inevitably"
10938,CHAPTER III,"stay there and perish, if they let an irrational superstition deter"
10939,CHAPTER III,them from the means which nature offered to their hands; that Ulysses
10940,CHAPTER III,might be deceived in his belief that these oxen had any sacred
10941,CHAPTER III,qualities above other oxen; and even admitting that they were the
10942,CHAPTER III,"property of the god of the Sun, as he said they were, the Sun did"
10943,CHAPTER III,"neither eat nor drink, and the gods were best served not by a"
10944,CHAPTER III,"scrupulous conscience, but by a thankful heart, which took freely"
10945,CHAPTER III,what they as freely offered: with these and such like persuasions he
10946,CHAPTER III,"prevailed on his half-famished and half-mutinous companions, to begin"
10947,CHAPTER III,the impious violation of their oath by the slaughter of seven of
10948,CHAPTER III,the fairest of these oxen which were grazing. Part they roasted and
10949,CHAPTER III,"eat, and part they offered in sacrifice to the gods, particularly"
10950,CHAPTER III,"to Apollo, god of the Sun, vowing to build a temple to his godhead,"
10951,CHAPTER III,"when they should arrive in Ithaca, and deck it with magnificent and"
10952,CHAPTER III,numerous gifts: Vain men! and superstition worse than that which they
10953,CHAPTER III,so lately derided! to imagine that prospective penitence can excuse a
10954,CHAPTER III,"present violation of duty, and that the pure natures of the heavenly"
10955,CHAPTER III,powers will admit of compromise or dispensation for sin.
10956,CHAPTER III,
10957,CHAPTER III,"But to their feast they fell, dividing the roasted portions of the"
10958,CHAPTER III,"flesh, savoury and pleasant meat to them, but a sad sight to the eyes,"
10959,CHAPTER III,"and a savour of death in the nostrils, of the waking Ulysses; who"
10960,CHAPTER III,"just woke in time to witness, but not soon enough to prevent, their"
10961,CHAPTER III,rash and sacrilegious banquet. He had scarce time to ask what great
10962,CHAPTER III,"mischief was this which they had done unto him, when behold, a"
10963,CHAPTER III,"prodigy! the ox-hides which they had stripped, began to creep, as if"
10964,CHAPTER III,they had life; and the roasted flesh bellowed as the ox used to do
10965,CHAPTER III,when he was living. The hair of Ulysses stood up on end with affright
10966,CHAPTER III,"at these omens; but his companions, like men whom the gods had"
10967,CHAPTER III,"infatuated to their destruction, persisted in their horrible banquet."
10968,CHAPTER III,
10969,CHAPTER III,The Sun from his burning chariot saw how Ulysses's men had slain his
10970,CHAPTER III,"oxen, and he cried to his father Jove, ""Revenge me upon these impious"
10971,CHAPTER III,"men who have slain my oxen, which it did me good to look upon when"
10972,CHAPTER III,I walked my heavenly round. In all my daily course I never saw such
10973,CHAPTER III,"bright and beautiful creatures as those my oxen were."" The father"
10974,CHAPTER III,promised that ample retribution should be taken of those accursed men:
10975,CHAPTER III,"which was fulfilled shortly after, when they took their leaves of the"
10976,CHAPTER III,fatal island.
10977,CHAPTER III,
10978,CHAPTER III,"Six days they feasted in spite of the signs of heaven, and on the"
10979,CHAPTER III,"seventh, the wind changing, they set their sails, and left the island;"
10980,CHAPTER III,and their hearts were cheerful with the banquets they had held; all
10981,CHAPTER III,"but the heart of Ulysses, which sank within him, as with wet eyes he"
10982,CHAPTER III,"beheld his friends, and gave them for lost, as men devoted to divine"
10983,CHAPTER III,vengeance. Which soon overtook them: for they had not gone many
10984,CHAPTER III,"leagues before a dreadful tempest arose, which burst their cables;"
10985,CHAPTER III,"down came their mast, crushing the scull of the pilot in its fall;"
10986,CHAPTER III,"off he fell from the stern into the water, and the bark wanting his"
10987,CHAPTER III,"management drove along at the wind's mercy: thunders roared, and"
10988,CHAPTER III,"terrible lightnings of Jove came down; first a bolt struck Eurylochus,"
10989,CHAPTER III,"then another, and then another, till all the crew were killed, and"
10990,CHAPTER III,their bodies swam about like sea-mews; and the ship was split in
10991,CHAPTER III,pieces: only Ulysses survived; and he had no hope of safety but in
10992,CHAPTER III,"tying himself to the mast, where he sat riding upon the waves, like"
10993,CHAPTER III,one that in no extremity would yield to fortune. Nine days was he
10994,CHAPTER III,"floating about with all the motions of the sea, with no other support"
10995,CHAPTER III,"than the slender mast under him, till the tenth night cast him, all"
10996,CHAPTER III,"spent and weary with toil, upon the friendly shores of the island"
10997,CHAPTER III,Ogygia.

11009,CHAPTER IV,"all those faithful partakers of his toil, who with him left Asia,"
11010,CHAPTER IV,"laden with the spoils of Troy, now not one remains, but all a prey to"
11011,CHAPTER IV,"the remorseless waves, and food for some great fish: their gallant"
11012,CHAPTER IV,"navy reduced to one ship, and that finally swallowed up and lost."
11013,CHAPTER IV,Where now are all their anxious thoughts of home? that perseverance
11014,CHAPTER IV,with which they went through the severest sufferings and the hardest
11015,CHAPTER IV,"labours to which poor sea-farers were ever exposed, that their toils"
11016,CHAPTER IV,at last might be crowned with the sight of their native shores and
11017,CHAPTER IV,wives at Ithaca!--Ulysses is now in the isle Ogygia; called the
11018,CHAPTER IV,"Delightful Island. The poor ship-wrecked chief, the slave of all"
11019,CHAPTER IV,"the elements, is once again raised by the caprice of fortune into a"
11020,CHAPTER IV,"shadow of prosperity. He that was cast naked upon the shore, bereft"
11021,CHAPTER IV,"of all his companions, has now a goddess to attend upon him, and"
11022,CHAPTER IV,his companions are the nymphs which never die.--Who has not heard
11023,CHAPTER IV,"of Calypso? her grove crowned with alders and poplars? her grotto,"
11024,CHAPTER IV,against which the luxuriant vine laid forth his purple grapes?
11025,CHAPTER IV,"her ever new delights, crystal fountains, running brooks, meadows"
11026,CHAPTER IV,flowering with sweet balm-gentle and with violet: blue violets which
11027,CHAPTER IV,like veins enameled the smooth breasts of each fragrant mead! It were
11028,CHAPTER IV,useless to describe over again what has been so well told already:
11029,CHAPTER IV,or to relate those soft arts of courtship which the goddess used to
11030,CHAPTER IV,detain Ulysses; the same in kind which she afterwards practised upon
11031,CHAPTER IV,"his less wary son, whom Minerva, in the shape of Mentor, hardly"
11032,CHAPTER IV,"preserved from her snares, when they came to the Delightful Island"
11033,CHAPTER IV,together in search of the scarce departed Ulysses.
11034,CHAPTER IV,
11035,CHAPTER IV,"A memorable example of married love, and a worthy instance how dear"
11036,CHAPTER IV,"to every good man his country is, was exhibited by Ulysses. If Circe"
11037,CHAPTER IV,"loved him sincerely, Calypso loves him with tenfold more warmth and"
11038,CHAPTER IV,"passion: she can deny him nothing, but his departure; she offers him"
11039,CHAPTER IV,"every thing, even to a participation of her immortality: if he will"
11040,CHAPTER IV,"stay and share in her pleasures, he shall never die. But death with"
11041,CHAPTER IV,"glory has greater charms for a mind heroic, than a life that shall"
11042,CHAPTER IV,"never die, with shame; and when he pledged his vows to his Penelope,"
11043,CHAPTER IV,he reserved no stipulation that he would forsake her whenever a
11044,CHAPTER IV,"goddess should think him worthy of her bed, but they had sworn to live"
11045,CHAPTER IV,"and grow old together: and he would not survive her if he could, nor"
11046,CHAPTER IV,"meanly share in immortality itself, from which she was excluded."
11047,CHAPTER IV,
11048,CHAPTER IV,These thoughts kept him pensive and melancholy in the midst of
11049,CHAPTER IV,"pleasure. His heart was on the seas, making voyages to Ithaca. Twelve"
11050,CHAPTER IV,"months had worn away, when Minerva from heaven saw her favourite, how"
11051,CHAPTER IV,"he sat still pining on the sea shores (his daily custom), wishing for"
11052,CHAPTER IV,a ship to carry him home. She (who is wisdom herself) was indignant
11053,CHAPTER IV,that so wise and brave a man as Ulysses should be held in effeminate
11054,CHAPTER IV,"bondage by an unworthy goddess: and at her request, her father Jove"
11055,CHAPTER IV,ordered Mercury to go down to the earth to command Calypso to dismiss
11056,CHAPTER IV,her guest. The divine messenger tied fast to his feet his winged
11057,CHAPTER IV,"shoes, which bear him over land and seas, and took in his hand his"
11058,CHAPTER IV,"golden rod, the ensign of his authority. Then wheeling in many an airy"
11059,CHAPTER IV,"round, he stayed not till he alighted on the firm top of the mountain"
11060,CHAPTER IV,"Pieria: thence he fetched a second circuit over the seas, kissing the"
11061,CHAPTER IV,"waves in his flight with his feet, as light as any sea-mew fishing"
11062,CHAPTER IV,"dips her wings, till he touched the isle Ogygia, and soared up from"
11063,CHAPTER IV,"the blue sea to the grotto of the goddess, to whom his errand was"
11064,CHAPTER IV,ordained.
11065,CHAPTER IV,
11066,CHAPTER IV,"His message struck a horror, checked by love, through all the"
11067,CHAPTER IV,"faculties of Calypso. She replied to it incensed: ""You gods are"
11068,CHAPTER IV,"insatiate past all that live, in all things which you affect; which"
11069,CHAPTER IV,"makes you so envious and grudging. It afflicts you to the heart, when"
11070,CHAPTER IV,"any goddess seeks the love of a mortal man in marriage, though you"
11071,CHAPTER IV,yourselves without scruple link yourselves to women of the earth. So
11072,CHAPTER IV,"it fared with you, when the delicious-fingered Morning shared Orion's"
11073,CHAPTER IV,"bed; you could never satisfy your hate and your jealousy, till you"
11074,CHAPTER IV,"had incensed the chastity-loving dame, Diana, _who leads the precise"
11075,CHAPTER IV,"life_, to come upon him by stealth in Ortygia, and pierce him through"
11076,CHAPTER IV,with her arrows. And when rich-haired Ceres gave the reins to her
11077,CHAPTER IV,"affections, and took Iasion (well worthy) to her arms, the secret"
11078,CHAPTER IV,"was not so cunningly kept but Jove had soon notice of it, and the"
11079,CHAPTER IV,"poor mortal paid for his felicity with death, struck through with"
11080,CHAPTER IV,"lightnings. And now you envy me the possession of a wretched man, whom"
11081,CHAPTER IV,"tempests have cast upon my shores, making him lawfully mine; whose"
11082,CHAPTER IV,"ship Jove rent in pieces with his hot thunderbolts, killing all his"
11083,CHAPTER IV,"friends. Him I have preserved, loved, nourished, made him mine by"
11084,CHAPTER IV,"protection, my creature, by every tie of gratitude, mine; have vowed"
11085,CHAPTER IV,to make him deathless like myself; him you will take from me. But I
11086,CHAPTER IV,"know your power, and that it is vain for me to resist. Tell your king"
11087,CHAPTER IV,"that I obey his mandates."""
11088,CHAPTER IV,
11089,CHAPTER IV,With an ill grace Calypso promised to fulfil the commands of Jove;
11090,CHAPTER IV,"and, Mercury departing, she went to find Ulysses, where he sat"
11091,CHAPTER IV,"outside the grotto, not knowing of the heavenly message, drowned in"
11092,CHAPTER IV,"discontent, not seeing any human probability of his ever returning"
11093,CHAPTER IV,home.
11094,CHAPTER IV,
11095,CHAPTER IV,"She said to him: ""Unhappy man, no longer afflict yourself with pining"
11096,CHAPTER IV,"after your country, but build you a ship, with which you may return"
11097,CHAPTER IV,home; since it is the will of the gods: who doubtless as they are
11098,CHAPTER IV,"greater in power than I, are greater in skill, and best can tell what"
11099,CHAPTER IV,"is fittest for man. But I call the gods, and my inward conscience, to"
11100,CHAPTER IV,"witness, that I had no thought but what stood with thy safety, nor"
11101,CHAPTER IV,would have done or counselled any thing against thy good. I persuaded
11102,CHAPTER IV,thee to nothing which I should not have followed myself in thy
11103,CHAPTER IV,"extremity: for my mind is innocent and simple. O, if thou knewest what"
11104,CHAPTER IV,"dreadful sufferings thou must yet endure, before ever thou reachest"
11105,CHAPTER IV,"thy native land, thou wouldest not esteem so hardly of a goddess's"
11106,CHAPTER IV,"offer to share her immortality with thee; nor, for a few years"
11107,CHAPTER IV,"enjoyment of a perishing Penelope, refuse an imperishable and"
11108,CHAPTER IV,"never-dying life with Calypso."""
11109,CHAPTER IV,
11110,CHAPTER IV,"He replied: ""Ever-honoured, great Calypso, let it not displease thee,"
11111,CHAPTER IV,that I a mortal man desire to see and converse again with a wife that
11112,CHAPTER IV,is mortal: human objects are best fitted to human infirmities. I well
11113,CHAPTER IV,"know how far in wisdom, in feature, in stature, proportion, beauty, in"
11114,CHAPTER IV,"all the gifts of the mind, thou exceedest my Penelope: she a mortal,"
11115,CHAPTER IV,"and subject to decay; thou immortal, ever growing, yet never old: yet"
11116,CHAPTER IV,"in her sight all my desires terminate, all my wishes; in the sight of"
11117,CHAPTER IV,"her, and of my country earth. If any god, envious of my return, shall"
11118,CHAPTER IV,"lay his dreadful hand upon me as I pass the seas, I submit: for the"
11119,CHAPTER IV,same powers have given me a mind not to sink under oppression. In wars
11120,CHAPTER IV,"and waves my sufferings have not been small."""
11121,CHAPTER IV,
11122,CHAPTER IV,"She heard his pleaded reasons, and of force she must assent; so to her"
11123,CHAPTER IV,"nymphs she gave in charge from her sacred woods to cut down timber,"
11124,CHAPTER IV,"to make Ulysses a ship. They obeyed, though in a work unsuitable to"
11125,CHAPTER IV,"their soft fingers, yet to obedience no sacrifice is hard: and Ulysses"
11126,CHAPTER IV,"busily bestirred himself, labouring far more hard than they, as was"
11127,CHAPTER IV,"fitting, till twenty tall trees, driest and fittest for timber, were"
11128,CHAPTER IV,"felled. Then like a skilful shipwright, he fell to joining the planks,"
11129,CHAPTER IV,"using the plane, the axe, and the auger, with such expedition, that in"
11130,CHAPTER IV,"four days' time a ship was made, complete with all her decks, hatches,"
11131,CHAPTER IV,"side-boards, yards. Calypso added linen for the sails, and tackling;"
11132,CHAPTER IV,"and when she was finished, she was a goodly vessel for a man to sail"
11133,CHAPTER IV,"in alone, or in company, over the wide seas. By the fifth morning she"

11135,CHAPTER IV,"garments, and gold and silver, given him by Calypso, took a last"
11136,CHAPTER IV,"leave of her, and of her nymphs, and of the isle Ogygia which had so"

11148,CHAPTER V,
11149,CHAPTER V,"At the stern of his solitary ship Ulysses sat, and steered right"
11150,CHAPTER V,"artfully. No sleep could seize his eye-lids. He beheld the Pleiads,"
11151,CHAPTER V,"the Bear which is by some called the Wain, that moves round about"
11152,CHAPTER V,"Orion, and keeps still above the ocean, and the slow-setting sign"
11153,CHAPTER V,"Bootes, which some name the Waggoner. Seventeen days he held his"
11154,CHAPTER V,"course, and on the eighteenth the coast of Phæacia was in sight. The"
11155,CHAPTER V,"figure of the land, as seen from the sea, was pretty and circular, and"
11156,CHAPTER V,looked something like a shield.
11157,CHAPTER V,
11158,CHAPTER V,"Neptune returning from visiting his favourite Æthiopians, from the"
11159,CHAPTER V,"mountains of the Solymi, descried Ulysses ploughing the waves, his"
11160,CHAPTER V,"domain. The sight of the man he so much hated for Polyphemus's sake,"
11161,CHAPTER V,"his son, whose eye Ulysses had put out, set the god's heart on fire;"
11162,CHAPTER V,"and snatching into his hand his horrid sea-sceptre, the trident of his"
11163,CHAPTER V,"power, he smote the air and the sea, and conjured up all his black"
11164,CHAPTER V,"storms, calling down night from the cope of heaven, and taking the"
11165,CHAPTER V,"earth into the sea, as it seemed, with clouds, through the darkness"
11166,CHAPTER V,"and indistinctness which prevailed, the billows rolling up before the"
11167,CHAPTER V,"fury of all the winds, that contended together in their mighty sport."
11168,CHAPTER V,
11169,CHAPTER V,"Then the knees of Ulysses bent with fear, and then all his spirit"
11170,CHAPTER V,"was spent, and he wished that he had been among the number of his"
11171,CHAPTER V,"countrymen who fell before Troy, and had their funerals celebrated by"
11172,CHAPTER V,"all the Greeks, rather than to perish thus, where no man could mourn"
11173,CHAPTER V,him or know him.
11174,CHAPTER V,
11175,CHAPTER V,"As he thought these melancholy thoughts, a huge wave took him and"
11176,CHAPTER V,"washed him overboard, ship and all upset amidst the billows, he"
11177,CHAPTER V,"struggling afar off, clinging to her stern broken off which he yet"
11178,CHAPTER V,"held, her mast cracking in two with the fury of that gust of mixed"
11179,CHAPTER V,"winds that struck it, sails and sail-yards fell into the deep, and he"
11180,CHAPTER V,"himself was long drowned under water, nor could get his head above,"
11181,CHAPTER V,"wave so met with wave, as if they strove which should depress him"
11182,CHAPTER V,"most, and the gorgeous garments given him by Calypso clung about him,"
11183,CHAPTER V,"and hindered his swimming; yet neither for this, nor for the overthrow"
11184,CHAPTER V,"of his ship, nor his own perilous condition, would he give up his"
11185,CHAPTER V,"drenched vessel, but, wrestling with Neptune, got at length hold of"
11186,CHAPTER V,"her again, and then sat in her bulk, insulting over death, which he"
11187,CHAPTER V,"had escaped, and the salt waves which he gave the sea again to give to"
11188,CHAPTER V,"other men: his ship, striving to live, floated at random, cuffed from"
11189,CHAPTER V,"wave to wave, hurled to and fro by all the winds, now Boreas tossed it"
11190,CHAPTER V,"to Notus, Notus passed it to Eurus, and Eurus to the west wind, who"
11191,CHAPTER V,kept up the horrid tennis.
11192,CHAPTER V,
11193,CHAPTER V,"Them in their mad sport Ino Leucothea beheld; Ino Leucothea, now a"
11194,CHAPTER V,"sea-goddess, but once a mortal and the daughter of Cadmus; she with"
11195,CHAPTER V,"pity beheld Ulysses the mark of their fierce contention, and rising"
11196,CHAPTER V,"from the waves alighted on the ship, in shape like to the sea-bird"
11197,CHAPTER V,"which is called a cormorant, and in her beak she held a wonderful"
11198,CHAPTER V,"girdle made of sea-weeds which grow at the bottom of the ocean, which"
11199,CHAPTER V,"she dropt at his feet, and the bird spake to Ulysses, and counselled"
11200,CHAPTER V,him not to trust any more to that fatal vessel against which god
11201,CHAPTER V,"Neptune had levelled his furious wrath, nor to those ill-befriending"
11202,CHAPTER V,"garments which Calypso had given him, but to quit both it and them and"
11203,CHAPTER V,"trust for his safety to swimming. ""And here,"" said the seeming bird,"
11204,CHAPTER V,"""take this girdle and tie about your middle, which has virtue to"
11205,CHAPTER V,"protect the wearer at sea, and you shall safely reach the shore; but"
11206,CHAPTER V,"when you have landed, cast it far from you back into the sea."" He"
11207,CHAPTER V,"did as the sea-bird instructed him, he stripped himself naked, and"
11208,CHAPTER V,"fastening the wondrous girdle about his middle, cast himself into the"
11209,CHAPTER V,seas to swim. The bird dived past his sight into the fathomless abyss
11210,CHAPTER V,of the ocean.
11211,CHAPTER V,
11212,CHAPTER V,"Two days and two nights he spent in struggling with the waves, though"
11213,CHAPTER V,"sore buffeted, and almost spent, never giving up himself for lost,"
11214,CHAPTER V,"such confidence he had in that charm which he wore about his middle,"
11215,CHAPTER V,and in the words of that divine bird. But the third morning the winds
11216,CHAPTER V,grew calm and all the heavens were clear. Then he saw himself nigh
11217,CHAPTER V,"land, which he knew to be the coast of the Phæacians, a people good to"
11218,CHAPTER V,"strangers, and abounding in ships, by whose favour he doubted not that"
11219,CHAPTER V,he should soon obtain a passage to his own country. And such joy he
11220,CHAPTER V,"conceived in his heart, as good sons have, that esteem their father's"
11221,CHAPTER V,"life dear, when long sickness has held him down to his bed, and wasted"
11222,CHAPTER V,"his body, and they see at length health return to the old man, with"
11223,CHAPTER V,"restored strength and spirits, in reward of their many prayers to"
11224,CHAPTER V,the gods for his safety: so precious was the prospect of home-return
11225,CHAPTER V,"to Ulysses, that he might restore health to his country (his better"
11226,CHAPTER V,"parent), that had long languished as full of distempers in his"
11227,CHAPTER V,absence. And then for his own safety's sake he had joy to see the
11228,CHAPTER V,"shores, the woods, so nigh and within his grasp as they seemed, and he"
11229,CHAPTER V,laboured with all the might of hands and feet to reach with swimming
11230,CHAPTER V,that nigh-seeming land.
11231,CHAPTER V,
11232,CHAPTER V,"But when he approached near, a horrid sound of a huge sea beating"
11233,CHAPTER V,"against rocks informed him that here was no place for landing, nor any"
11234,CHAPTER V,"harbour for man's resort, but through the weeds and the foam which the"
11235,CHAPTER V,sea belched up against the land he could dimly discover the rugged
11236,CHAPTER V,"shore all bristled with flints, and all that part of the coast one"
11237,CHAPTER V,"impending rock that seemed impossible to climb, and the water all"
11238,CHAPTER V,"about so deep, that not a sand was there for any tired foot to rest"
11239,CHAPTER V,"upon, and every moment he feared lest some wave more cruel than the"
11240,CHAPTER V,"rest should crush him against a cliff, rendering worse than vain"
11241,CHAPTER V,all his landing: and should he swim to seek a more commodious haven
11242,CHAPTER V,"further on, he was fearful lest, weak and spent as he was, the winds"
11243,CHAPTER V,"would force him back a long way off into the main, where the terrible"
11244,CHAPTER V,"god Neptune, for wrath that he had so nearly escaped his power, having"
11245,CHAPTER V,"gotten him again into his domain, would send out some great whale (of"
11246,CHAPTER V,which those seas breed a horrid number) to swallow him up alive; with
11247,CHAPTER V,such malignity he still pursued him.
11248,CHAPTER V,
11249,CHAPTER V,"While these thoughts distracted him with diversity of dangers, one"
11250,CHAPTER V,"bigger wave drove against a sharp rock his naked body, which it gashed"
11251,CHAPTER V,"and tore, and wanted little of breaking all his bones, so rude was"
11252,CHAPTER V,the shock. But in this extremity she prompted him that never failed
11253,CHAPTER V,him at need. Minerva (who is wisdom itself) put it into his thoughts
11254,CHAPTER V,"no longer to keep swimming off and on, as one dallying with danger,"
11255,CHAPTER V,"but boldly to force the shore that threatened him, and to hug the"
11256,CHAPTER V,"rock that had torn him so rudely; which with both hands he clasped,"
11257,CHAPTER V,"wrestling with extremity, till the rage of that billow which had"
11258,CHAPTER V,driven him upon it was past; but then again the rock drove back that
11259,CHAPTER V,"wave so furiously, that it reft him of his hold, sucking him with"
11260,CHAPTER V,"it in its return, and the sharp rock (his cruel friend) to which he"
11261,CHAPTER V,"clinged for succour, rent the flesh so sore from his hands in parting,"
11262,CHAPTER V,"that he fell off, and could sustain no longer: quite under water he"
11263,CHAPTER V,"fell, and past the help of fate, there had the hapless Ulysses lost"
11264,CHAPTER V,"all portion that he had in this life, if Minerva had not prompted his"
11265,CHAPTER V,"wisdom in that peril to essay another course, and to explore some"
11266,CHAPTER V,"other shelter, ceasing to attempt that landing-place."
11267,CHAPTER V,
11268,CHAPTER V,She guided his wearied and nigh-exhausted limbs to the mouth of the
11269,CHAPTER V,"fair river Callicoe, which not far from thence disbursed its watery"
11270,CHAPTER V,"tribute to the ocean. Here the shores were easy and accessible, and"
11271,CHAPTER V,"the rocks, which rather adorned than defended its banks, so smooth,"
11272,CHAPTER V,that they seemed polished of purpose to invite the landing of our
11273,CHAPTER V,"sea-wanderer, and to atone for the uncourteous treatment which those"
11274,CHAPTER V,"less hospitable cliffs had afforded him. And the god of the river, as"
11275,CHAPTER V,"if in pity, stayed his current and smoothed his waters, to make his"
11276,CHAPTER V,landing more easy: for sacred to the ever-living deities of the fresh
11277,CHAPTER V,"waters, be they mountain-stream, river, or lake, is the cry of erring"
11278,CHAPTER V,"mortals that seek their aid, by reason that being inland-bred they"
11279,CHAPTER V,partake more of the gentle humanities of our nature than those marine
11280,CHAPTER V,"deities, whom Neptune trains up in tempests in the unpitying recesses"
11281,CHAPTER V,of his salt abyss.
11282,CHAPTER V,
11283,CHAPTER V,So by the favour of the river's god Ulysses crept to land
11284,CHAPTER V,"half-drowned; both his knees faltering, his strong hands falling down"
11285,CHAPTER V,"through weakness from the excessive toils he had endured, his cheek"
11286,CHAPTER V,"and nostrils flowing with froth of the sea-brine, much of which he had"
11287,CHAPTER V,"swallowed in that conflict, voice and breath spent, down he sank as in"
11288,CHAPTER V,death. Dead weary he was. It seemed that the sea had soaked through
11289,CHAPTER V,"his heart, and the pains he felt in all his veins were little less"
11290,CHAPTER V,than those which one feels that has endured the torture of the rack.
11291,CHAPTER V,"But when his spirits came a little to themselves, and his recollection"
11292,CHAPTER V,"by degrees began to return, he rose up, and unloosing from his"
11293,CHAPTER V,"waist the girdle or charm which that divine bird had given him, and"
11294,CHAPTER V,"remembering the charge which he had received with it, he flung it far"
11295,CHAPTER V,from him into the river. Back it swam with the course of the ebbing
11296,CHAPTER V,"stream till it reached the sea, where the fair hands of Ino Leucothea"
11297,CHAPTER V,received it to keep it as a pledge of safety to any future shipwrecked
11298,CHAPTER V,"mariner, that like Ulysses should wander in those perilous waves."
11299,CHAPTER V,
11300,CHAPTER V,"Then he kissed the humble earth in token of safety, and on he went by"
11301,CHAPTER V,"the side of that pleasant river, till he came where a thicker shade of"
11302,CHAPTER V,rushes that grew on its banks seemed to point out the place where he
11303,CHAPTER V,might rest his sea-wearied limbs. And here a fresh perplexity divided
11304,CHAPTER V,"his mind, whether he should pass the night, which was coming on, in"
11305,CHAPTER V,"that place, where, though he feared no other enemies, the damps and"
11306,CHAPTER V,frosts of the chill sea-air in that exposed situation might be death
11307,CHAPTER V,to him in his weak state; or whether he had better climb the next
11308,CHAPTER V,"hill, and pierce the depth of some shady wood, in which he might find"
11309,CHAPTER V,"a warm and sheltered though insecure repose, subject to the approach"
11310,CHAPTER V,of any wild beast that roamed that way. Best did this last course
11311,CHAPTER V,"appear to him, though with some danger, as that which was more"
11312,CHAPTER V,"honourable and savoured more of strife and self-exertion, than to"
11313,CHAPTER V,perish without a struggle the passive victim of cold and the elements.
11314,CHAPTER V,
11315,CHAPTER V,"So he bent his course to the nearest woods, where, entering in, he"
11316,CHAPTER V,"found a thicket, mostly of wild olives and such low trees, yet growing"
11317,CHAPTER V,"so intertwined and knit together, that the moist wind had not leave to"
11318,CHAPTER V,"play through their branches, nor the sun's scorching beams to pierce"
11319,CHAPTER V,"their recesses, nor any shower to beat through, they grew so thick"
11320,CHAPTER V,"and as it were folded each in the other: here creeping in, he made"
11321,CHAPTER V,"his bed of the leaves which were beginning to fall, of which was"
11322,CHAPTER V,such abundance that two or three men might have spread them ample
11323,CHAPTER V,"coverings, such as might shield them from the winter's rage, though"
11324,CHAPTER V,"the air breathed steel and blew as it would burst. Here creeping in,"
11325,CHAPTER V,"he heaped up store of leaves all about him, as a man would billets"
11326,CHAPTER V,"upon a winter fire, and lay down in the midst. Rich seed of virtue"
11327,CHAPTER V,lying hid in poor leaves! Here Minerva soon gave him sound sleep; and
11328,CHAPTER V,here all his long toils past seemed to be concluded and shut up within
11329,CHAPTER V,the little sphere of his refreshed and closed eyelids.

11340,CHAPTER VI,
11341,CHAPTER VI,Meantime Minerva designing an interview between the king's daughter of
11342,CHAPTER VI,"that country and Ulysses when he should awake, went by night to the"
11343,CHAPTER VI,"palace of king Alcinous, and stood at the bedside of the princess"

11345,CHAPTER VI,addressed the sleeping princess:
11346,CHAPTER VI,
11347,CHAPTER VI,"""Nausicaa, why do you lie sleeping here, and never bestow a thought"
11348,CHAPTER VI,"upon your bridal ornaments, of which you have many and beautiful, laid"
11349,CHAPTER VI,"up in your wardrobe against the day of your marriage, which cannot be"
11350,CHAPTER VI,"far distant; when you shall have need of all, not only to deck your"
11351,CHAPTER VI,"own person, but to give away in presents to the virgins that honouring"
11352,CHAPTER VI,you shall attend you to the temple? Your reputation stands much upon
11353,CHAPTER VI,the timely care of these things; these things are they which fill
11354,CHAPTER VI,father and reverend mother with delight. Let us arise betimes to wash
11355,CHAPTER VI,your fair vestments of linen and silks in the river; and request your
11356,CHAPTER VI,"sire to lend you mules and a coach, for your wardrobe is heavy, and"
11357,CHAPTER VI,"the place where we must wash is distant, and besides it fits not a"
11358,CHAPTER VI,"great princess like you to go so far on foot."""
11359,CHAPTER VI,
11360,CHAPTER VI,"So saying she went away, and Nausicaa awoke, full of pleasing thoughts"
11361,CHAPTER VI,"of her marriage, which the dream had told her was not far distant; and"
11362,CHAPTER VI,"as soon as it was dawn, she arose and dressed herself, and went to"
11363,CHAPTER VI,find her parents.
11364,CHAPTER VI,
11365,CHAPTER VI,"The queen her mother was already up, and seated among her maids,"
11366,CHAPTER VI,"spinning at her wheel, as the fashion was in those primitive times,"
11367,CHAPTER VI,when great ladies did not disdain housewifery: and the king her father
11368,CHAPTER VI,was preparing to go abroad at that early hour to council with his
11369,CHAPTER VI,grave senate.
11370,CHAPTER VI,
11371,CHAPTER VI,"""My father,"" she said, ""will you not order mules and a coach to be got"
11372,CHAPTER VI,"ready, that I may go and wash, I and my maids, at the cisterns that"
11373,CHAPTER VI,"stand without the city?"""
11374,CHAPTER VI,
11375,CHAPTER VI,"""What washing does my daughter speak of?"" said Alcinous."
11376,CHAPTER VI,
11377,CHAPTER VI,"""Mine and my brothers' garments,"" she replied, ""that have contracted"
11378,CHAPTER VI,soil by this time with lying by so long in the wardrobe. Five sons
11379,CHAPTER VI,"have you, that are my brothers; two of them are married, and three"
11380,CHAPTER VI,are bachelors; these last it concerns to have their garments neat and
11381,CHAPTER VI,unsoiled; it may advance their fortunes in marriage: and who but I
11382,CHAPTER VI,"their sister should have a care of these things? You yourself, my"
11383,CHAPTER VI,"father, have need of the whitest apparel, when you go, as now, to the"
11384,CHAPTER VI,"council."""
11385,CHAPTER VI,
11386,CHAPTER VI,"She used this plea, modestly dissembling her care of her own nuptials"
11387,CHAPTER VI,to her father; who was not displeased at this instance of his
11388,CHAPTER VI,daughter's discretion: for a seasonable care about marriage may be
11389,CHAPTER VI,"permitted to a young maiden, provided it be accompanied with modesty"
11390,CHAPTER VI,and dutiful submission to her parents in the choice of her future
11391,CHAPTER VI,husband: and there was no fear of Nausicaa chusing wrongly or
11392,CHAPTER VI,"improperly, for she was as wise as she was beautiful, and the best in"
11393,CHAPTER VI,all Phæacia were suitors to her for her love. So Alcinous readily gave
11394,CHAPTER VI,"consent that she should go, ordering mules and a coach to be prepared."
11395,CHAPTER VI,"And Nausicaa brought from her chamber all her vestments, and laid them"
11396,CHAPTER VI,"up in the coach, and her mother placed bread and wine in the coach,"
11397,CHAPTER VI,"and oil in a golden cruse, to soften the bright skins of Nausicaa and"
11398,CHAPTER VI,her maids when they came out of the river.
11399,CHAPTER VI,
11400,CHAPTER VI,"Nausicaa making her maids get up into the coach with her, lashed the"
11401,CHAPTER VI,"mules, till they brought her to the cisterns which stood a little on"
11402,CHAPTER VI,"the outside of the town, and were supplied with water from the river"
11403,CHAPTER VI,Callicoe.
11404,CHAPTER VI,
11405,CHAPTER VI,"There her attendants unyoked the mules, took out the clothes, and"
11406,CHAPTER VI,"steeped them in the cisterns, washing them in several waters, and"
11407,CHAPTER VI,"afterwards treading them clean with their feet, venturing wagers who"
11408,CHAPTER VI,"should have done soonest and cleanest, and using many pretty pastimes"
11409,CHAPTER VI,"to beguile their labour as young maids use, while the princess looked"
11410,CHAPTER VI,"on. When they had laid their clothes to dry, they fell to playing"
11411,CHAPTER VI,"again, and Nausicaa joined them in a game with the ball, which is used"
11412,CHAPTER VI,"in that country, which is performed by tossing the ball from hand"
11413,CHAPTER VI,"to hand with great expedition, she who begins the pastime singing a"
11414,CHAPTER VI,song. It chanced that the princess whose turn it became to toss the
11415,CHAPTER VI,"ball, sent it so far from its mark, that it fell beyond into one of"
11416,CHAPTER VI,"the cisterns of the river: at which the whole company, in merry"
11417,CHAPTER VI,"consternation, set up a shriek so loud as waked the sleeping Ulysses,"
11418,CHAPTER VI,"who was taking his rest after his long toils, in the woods not far"
11419,CHAPTER VI,distant from the place where these young maids had come to wash.
11420,CHAPTER VI,
11421,CHAPTER VI,"At the sound of female voices Ulysses crept forth from his retirement,"
11422,CHAPTER VI,making himself a covering with boughs and leaves as well as he could
11423,CHAPTER VI,to shroud his nakedness. The sudden appearance of his weather-beaten
11424,CHAPTER VI,"and almost naked form, so frighted the maidens that they scudded away"
11425,CHAPTER VI,"into the woods and all about to hide themselves, only Minerva (who"
11426,CHAPTER VI,"had brought about this interview to admirable purposes, by seemingly"
11427,CHAPTER VI,"accidental means) put courage into the breast of Nausicaa, and she"
11428,CHAPTER VI,"stayed where she was, and resolved to know what manner of man he was,"
11429,CHAPTER VI,and what was the occasion of his strange coming to them.
11430,CHAPTER VI,
11431,CHAPTER VI,"He not venturing (for delicacy) to approach and clasp her knees, as"
11432,CHAPTER VI,"suppliants should, but standing far off, addressed this speech to the"
11433,CHAPTER VI,young princess:
11434,CHAPTER VI,
11435,CHAPTER VI,"""Before I presume rudely to press my petitions, I should first ask"
11436,CHAPTER VI,"whether I am addressing a mortal woman, or one of the goddesses. If a"
11437,CHAPTER VI,"goddess, you seem to me to be likest to Diana, the chaste huntress,"
11438,CHAPTER VI,"the daughter of Jove. Like hers are your lineaments, your stature,"
11439,CHAPTER VI,"your features, and air divine."""
11440,CHAPTER VI,
11441,CHAPTER VI,"She making answer that she was no goddess, but a mortal maid, he"
11442,CHAPTER VI,continued:
11443,CHAPTER VI,
11444,CHAPTER VI,"""If a woman, thrice blessed are both the authors of your birth, thrice"
11445,CHAPTER VI,"blessed are your brothers, who even to rapture must have joy in your"
11446,CHAPTER VI,"perfections, to see you grown so like a young tree, and so graceful."
11447,CHAPTER VI,But most blessed of all that breathe is he that has the gift to engage
11448,CHAPTER VI,your young neck in the yoke of marriage. I never saw that man that was
11449,CHAPTER VI,worthy of you. I never saw man or woman that at all parts equalled
11450,CHAPTER VI,you. Lately at Delos (where I touched) I saw a young palm which grew
11451,CHAPTER VI,beside Apollo's temple; it exceeded all the trees which ever I beheld
11452,CHAPTER VI,for straitness and beauty: I can compare you only to that. A stupor
11453,CHAPTER VI,"past admiration strikes me, joined with fear, which keeps me back from"
11454,CHAPTER VI,"approaching you, to embrace your knees. Nor is it strange; for one"
11455,CHAPTER VI,"of freshest and firmest spirit would falter, approaching near to so"
11456,CHAPTER VI,bright an object: but I am one whom a cruel habit of calamity has
11457,CHAPTER VI,prepared to receive strong impressions. Twenty days the unrelenting
11458,CHAPTER VI,"seas have tossed me up and down coming from Ogygia, and at length cast"
11459,CHAPTER VI,me ship-wrecked last night upon your coast. I have seen no man or
11460,CHAPTER VI,"woman since I landed but yourself. All that I crave is clothes, which"
11461,CHAPTER VI,"you may spare me, and to be shown the way to some neighbouring town."
11462,CHAPTER VI,"The gods, who have care of strangers, will requite you for these"
11463,CHAPTER VI,"courtesies."""
11464,CHAPTER VI,
11465,CHAPTER VI,She admiring to hear such complimentary words proceed out of the mouth
11466,CHAPTER VI,"of one whose outside looked so rough and unpromising, made answer:"
11467,CHAPTER VI,"""Stranger, I discern neither sloth nor folly in you, and yet I see"
11468,CHAPTER VI,that you are poor and wretched: from which I gather that neither
11469,CHAPTER VI,wisdom nor industry can secure felicity; only Jove bestows it upon
11470,CHAPTER VI,whomsoever he pleases. He perhaps has reduced you to this plight.
11471,CHAPTER VI,"However, since your wanderings have brought you so near to our city,"
11472,CHAPTER VI,it lies in our duty to supply your wants. Clothes and what else
11473,CHAPTER VI,"a human hand should give to one so suppliant, and so tamed with"
11474,CHAPTER VI,"calamity, you shall not want. We will shew you our city and tell you"
11475,CHAPTER VI,"the name of our people. This is the land of the Phæacians, of which my"
11476,CHAPTER VI,"father Alcinous is king."""
11477,CHAPTER VI,
11478,CHAPTER VI,Then calling her attendants who had dispersed on the first sight of
11479,CHAPTER VI,"Ulysses, she rebuked them for their fear, and said: ""This man is no"
11480,CHAPTER VI,"Cyclop, nor monster of sea or land, that you should fear him; but he"
11481,CHAPTER VI,"seems manly, staid, and discreet, and though decayed in his outward"
11482,CHAPTER VI,"appearance, yet he has the mind's riches, wit and fortitude, in"
11483,CHAPTER VI,abundance. Show him the cisterns where he may wash him from the
11484,CHAPTER VI,"sea-weeds and foam that hang about him, and let him have garments that"
11485,CHAPTER VI,"fit him out of those which we have brought with us to the cisterns."""
11486,CHAPTER VI,
11487,CHAPTER VI,"Ulysses retiring a little out of sight, cleansed him in the cisterns"
11488,CHAPTER VI,from the soil and impurities with which the rocks and waves had
11489,CHAPTER VI,"covered all his body, and clothing himself with befitting raiment,"
11490,CHAPTER VI,"which the princess's attendants had given him, he presented himself"
11491,CHAPTER VI,in more worthy shape to Nausicaa. She admired to see what a comely
11492,CHAPTER VI,"personage he was, now he was dressed in all parts; she thought him"
11493,CHAPTER VI,some king or hero: and secretly wished that the gods would be pleased
11494,CHAPTER VI,to give her such a husband.
11495,CHAPTER VI,
11496,CHAPTER VI,"Then causing her attendants to yoke her mules, and lay up the"
11497,CHAPTER VI,"vestments, which the sun's heat had sufficiently dried, in the coach,"
11498,CHAPTER VI,"she ascended with her maids, and drove off to the palace; bidding"
11499,CHAPTER VI,"Ulysses, as she departed, keep an eye upon the coach, and to follow it"
11500,CHAPTER VI,"on foot at some distance: which she did, because if she had suffered"
11501,CHAPTER VI,"him to have rode in the coach with her, it might have subjected her to"
11502,CHAPTER VI,"some misconstructions of the common people, who are always ready to"
11503,CHAPTER VI,"vilify and censure their betters, and to suspect that charity is not"
11504,CHAPTER VI,"always pure charity, but that love or some sinister intention lies hid"
11505,CHAPTER VI,under its disguise. So discreet and attentive to appearance in all her
11506,CHAPTER VI,actions was this admirable princess.
11507,CHAPTER VI,
11508,CHAPTER VI,"Ulysses as he entered the city wondered to see its magnificence, its"
11509,CHAPTER VI,"markets, buildings, temples; its walls and rampires; its trade, and"
11510,CHAPTER VI,"resort of men; its harbours for shipping, which is the strength of"
11511,CHAPTER VI,"the Phæacian state. But when he approached the palace, and beheld its"
11512,CHAPTER VI,"riches, the proportion of its architecture, its avenues, gardens,"
11513,CHAPTER VI,"statues, fountains, he stood rapt in admiration, and almost forgot"
11514,CHAPTER VI,his own condition in surveying the flourishing estate of others: but
11515,CHAPTER VI,"recollecting himself he passed on boldly into the inner apartment,"
11516,CHAPTER VI,where the king and queen were sitting at dinner with their peers;
11517,CHAPTER VI,Nausicaa having prepared them for his approach.
11518,CHAPTER VI,
11519,CHAPTER VI,"To them humbly kneeling he made it his request, that since fortune"
11520,CHAPTER VI,"had cast him naked upon their shores, they would take him into their"
11521,CHAPTER VI,"protection, and grant him a conveyance by one of the ships, of which"
11522,CHAPTER VI,"their great Phæacian state had such good store, to carry him to his"
11523,CHAPTER VI,"own country. Having delivered his request, to grace it with more"
11524,CHAPTER VI,"humility he went and sat himself down upon the hearth among the ashes,"
11525,CHAPTER VI,as the custom was in those days when any would make a petition to the
11526,CHAPTER VI,throne.
11527,CHAPTER VI,
11528,CHAPTER VI,He seemed a petitioner of so great state and of so superior a
11529,CHAPTER VI,"deportment, that Alcinous himself arose to do him honour, and causing"
11530,CHAPTER VI,"him to leave that abject station which he had assumed, placed him next"
11531,CHAPTER VI,"to his throne, upon a chair of state, and thus he spake to his peers:"
11532,CHAPTER VI,
11533,CHAPTER VI,"""Lords and counsellors of Phæacia, ye see this man, who he is we know"
11534,CHAPTER VI,"not, that is come to us in the guise of a petitioner: he seems no mean"
11535,CHAPTER VI,"one; but whoever he is, it is fit, since the gods have cast him upon"
11536,CHAPTER VI,"our protection, that we grant him the rites of hospitality, while he"
11537,CHAPTER VI,"stays with us, and at his departure, a ship well manned to convey so"
11538,CHAPTER VI,"worthy a personage as he seems to be, in a manner suitable to his"
11539,CHAPTER VI,"rank, to his own country."""
11540,CHAPTER VI,
11541,CHAPTER VI,This counsel the peers with one consent approved; and wine and meat
11542,CHAPTER VI,"being set before Ulysses, he ate and drank, and gave the gods thanks"
11543,CHAPTER VI,who had stirred up the royal bounty of Alcinous to aid him in that
11544,CHAPTER VI,extremity. But not as yet did he reveal to the king and queen who he
11545,CHAPTER VI,"was, or whence he had come; only in brief terms he related his being"
11546,CHAPTER VI,"cast upon their shores, his sleep in the woods, and his meeting with"
11547,CHAPTER VI,"the princess Nausicaa: whose generosity, mingled with discretion"
11548,CHAPTER VI,"filled her parents with delight, as Ulysses in eloquent phrases"
11549,CHAPTER VI,"adorned and commended her virtues. But Alcinous, humanely considering"
11550,CHAPTER VI,"that the troubles which his guest had undergone required rest, as well"
11551,CHAPTER VI,"as refreshment by food, dismissed him early in the evening to his"
11552,CHAPTER VI,chamber; where in a magnificent apartment Ulysses found a smoother
11553,CHAPTER VI,"bed, but not a sounder repose, than he had enjoyed the night before,"
11554,CHAPTER VI,sleeping upon leaves which he had scraped together in his necessity.

11563,CHAPTER VII,to stone.--The young shepherd._
11564,CHAPTER VII,
11565,CHAPTER VII,
11566,CHAPTER VII,"When it was day-light, Alcinous caused it to be proclaimed by the"
11567,CHAPTER VII,"heralds about the town, that there was come to the palace a stranger,"
11568,CHAPTER VII,"shipwrecked on their coast, that in mien and person resembled a god:"
11569,CHAPTER VII,and inviting all the chief people of the city to come and do honour to
11570,CHAPTER VII,the stranger.
11571,CHAPTER VII,
11572,CHAPTER VII,"The palace was quickly filled with guests, old and young, for whose"
11573,CHAPTER VII,"cheer, and to grace Ulysses more, Alcinous made a kingly feast with"
11574,CHAPTER VII,banquetings and music. Then Ulysses being seated at a table next the
11575,CHAPTER VII,"king and queen, in all men's view; after they had feasted, Alcinous"
11576,CHAPTER VII,"ordered Demodocus, the court-singer, to be called to sing some song"
11577,CHAPTER VII,"of the deeds of heroes, to charm the ear of his guest. Demodocus came"
11578,CHAPTER VII,"and reached his harp, where it hung between two pillars of silver: and"
11579,CHAPTER VII,"then the blind singer, to whom, in recompense of his lost sight, the"
11580,CHAPTER VII,"muses had given an inward discernment, a soul and a voice to excite"
11581,CHAPTER VII,"the hearts of men and gods to delight, began in grave and solemn"
11582,CHAPTER VII,"strains to sing the glories of men highliest famed. He chose a poem,"
11583,CHAPTER VII,"whose subject was, The stern Strife stirred up between Ulysses and"
11584,CHAPTER VII,"great Achilles, as at a banquet sacred to the gods in dreadful"
11585,CHAPTER VII,language they expressed their difference; while Agamemnon sat rejoiced
11586,CHAPTER VII,in soul to hear those Grecians jar: for the oracle in Pytho had told
11587,CHAPTER VII,"him, that the period of their wars in Troy should then be, when the"
11588,CHAPTER VII,"kings of Greece, anxious to arrive at the wished conclusion, should"
11589,CHAPTER VII,"fall to strife, and contend which must end the war, force or"
11590,CHAPTER VII,stratagem.
11591,CHAPTER VII,
11592,CHAPTER VII,"This brave contention he expressed so to the life, in the very words"
11593,CHAPTER VII,"which they both used in the quarrel, as brought tears into the eyes of"
11594,CHAPTER VII,"Ulysses at the remembrance of past passages of his life, and he held"
11595,CHAPTER VII,his large purple weed before his face to conceal it. Then craving a
11596,CHAPTER VII,"cup of wine, he poured it out in secret libation to the gods, who had"
11597,CHAPTER VII,put into the mind of Demodocus unknowingly to do him so much honour.
11598,CHAPTER VII,But when the moving poet began to tell of other occurrences where
11599,CHAPTER VII,"Ulysses had been present, the memory of his brave followers who had"
11600,CHAPTER VII,"been with him in all difficulties, now swallowed up and lost in the"
11601,CHAPTER VII,"ocean, and of those kings that had fought with him at Troy, some of"
11602,CHAPTER VII,"whom were dead, some exiles like himself, forced itself so strongly"
11603,CHAPTER VII,"upon his mind, that forgetful where he was, he sobbed outright with"
11604,CHAPTER VII,"passion; which yet he restrained, but not so cunningly but Alcinous"
11605,CHAPTER VII,"perceived it, and without taking notice of it to Ulysses, privately"
11606,CHAPTER VII,gave signs that Demodocus should cease from his singing.
11607,CHAPTER VII,
11608,CHAPTER VII,"Next followed dancing in the Phæacian fashion, when they would shew"
11609,CHAPTER VII,"respect to their guests; which was succeeded by trials of skill, games"
11610,CHAPTER VII,"of strength, running, racing, hurling of the quoit, mock fights,"
11611,CHAPTER VII,"hurling of the javelin, shooting with the bow: in some of which"
11612,CHAPTER VII,"Ulysses modestly challenging his entertainers, performed such feats of"
11613,CHAPTER VII,strength and prowess as gave the admiring Phæacians fresh reason to
11614,CHAPTER VII,"imagine that he was either some god, or hero of the race of the gods."
11615,CHAPTER VII,
11616,CHAPTER VII,"These solemn shows and pageants in honour of his guest, king Alcinous"
11617,CHAPTER VII,"continued for the space of many days, as if he could never be weary of"
11618,CHAPTER VII,shewing courtesies to so worthy a stranger. In all this time he never
11619,CHAPTER VII,"asked him his name, nor sought to know more of him than he of his own"
11620,CHAPTER VII,"accord disclosed: till on a day as they were seated feasting, after"
11621,CHAPTER VII,"the feast was ended, Demodocus being called, as was the custom, to"
11622,CHAPTER VII,"sing some grave matter, sang how Ulysses, on that night when Troy"
11623,CHAPTER VII,"was fired, made dreadful proof of his valour, maintaining singly a"
11624,CHAPTER VII,"combat against the whole household of Deiphobus, to which the divine"
11625,CHAPTER VII,"expresser gave both act and passion, and breathed such a fire into"
11626,CHAPTER VII,"Ulysses's deeds, that it inspired old death with life in the lively"
11627,CHAPTER VII,"expressing of slaughters, and rendered life so sweet and passionate"
11628,CHAPTER VII,"in the hearers, that all who heard felt it fleet from them in the"
11629,CHAPTER VII,"narration: which made Ulysses even pity his own slaughterous deeds,"
11630,CHAPTER VII,"and feel touches of remorse, to see how song can revive a dead man"
11631,CHAPTER VII,"from the grave, yet no way can it defend a living man from death: and"
11632,CHAPTER VII,"in imagination he underwent some part of death's horrors, and felt in"
11633,CHAPTER VII,his living body a taste of those dying pangs which he had dealt to
11634,CHAPTER VII,"others; that with the strong conceit, tears (the true interpreters of"
11635,CHAPTER VII,unutterable emotion) stood in his eyes.
11636,CHAPTER VII,
11637,CHAPTER VII,"Which king Alcinous noting, and that this was now the second time that"
11638,CHAPTER VII,he had perceived him to be moved at the mention of events touching the
11639,CHAPTER VII,"Trojan wars, he took occasion to ask whether his guest had lost any"
11640,CHAPTER VII,"friend or kinsman at Troy, that Demodocus's singing had brought into"
11641,CHAPTER VII,"his mind. Then Ulysses, drying the tears with his cloak, and observing"
11642,CHAPTER VII,"that the eyes of all the company were upon him, desirous to give them"
11643,CHAPTER VII,"satisfaction in what he could, and thinking this a fit time to reveal"
11644,CHAPTER VII,"his true name and destination, spake as follows:"
11645,CHAPTER VII,
11646,CHAPTER VII,"""The courtesies which ye all have shewn me, and in particular yourself"
11647,CHAPTER VII,"and princely daughter, O king Alcinous, demand from me that I should"
11648,CHAPTER VII,no longer keep you in ignorance of what or who I am; for to reserve
11649,CHAPTER VII,"any secret from you, who have with such openness of friendship"
11650,CHAPTER VII,"embraced my love, would argue either a pusillanimous or an ungrateful"
11651,CHAPTER VII,"mind in me. Know then that I am that _Ulysses_, of whom I perceive ye"
11652,CHAPTER VII,have heard something; who heretofore have filled the world with the
11653,CHAPTER VII,"renown of my policies. I am he by whose counsels, if Fame is to be"
11654,CHAPTER VII,"believed at all, more than by the united valour of all the Grecians,"
11655,CHAPTER VII,Troy fell. I am that unhappy man whom the heavens and angry gods have
11656,CHAPTER VII,"conspired to keep an exile on the seas, wandering to seek my home"
11657,CHAPTER VII,which still flies from me. The land which I am in quest of is Ithaca;
11658,CHAPTER VII,in whose ports some ship belonging to your navigation-famed Phæacian
11659,CHAPTER VII,state may haply at some time have found a refuge from tempests. If
11660,CHAPTER VII,"ever you have experienced such kindness, requite it now; by granting"
11661,CHAPTER VII,"to me, who am the king of that land, a passport to that land."""
11662,CHAPTER VII,
11663,CHAPTER VII,"Admiration seized all the court of Alcinous, to behold in their"
11664,CHAPTER VII,"presence one of the number of those heroes who fought at Troy, whose"
11665,CHAPTER VII,"divine story had been made known to them by songs and poems, but of"
11666,CHAPTER VII,"the truth they had little known, or rather they had hitherto accounted"
11667,CHAPTER VII,those heroic exploits as fictions and exaggerations of poets; but
11668,CHAPTER VII,"having seen and made proof of the real Ulysses, they began to take"
11669,CHAPTER VII,"those supposed inventions to be real verities, and the tale of Troy to"
11670,CHAPTER VII,be as true as it was delightful.
11671,CHAPTER VII,
11672,CHAPTER VII,"Then king Alcinous made answer: ""Thrice fortunate ought we to esteem"
11673,CHAPTER VII,"our lot, in having seen and conversed with a man of whom report hath"
11674,CHAPTER VII,"spoken so loudly, but, as it seems, nothing beyond the truth. Though"
11675,CHAPTER VII,we could desire no felicity greater than to have you always among
11676,CHAPTER VII,"us, renowned Ulysses, yet your desire having been expressed so often"
11677,CHAPTER VII,"and so deeply to return home, we can deny you nothing, though to our"
11678,CHAPTER VII,"own loss. Our kingdom of Phæacia, as you know, is chiefly rich in"
11679,CHAPTER VII,"shipping. In all parts of the world, where there are navigable seas,"
11680,CHAPTER VII,"or ships can pass, our vessels will be found. You cannot name a coast"
11681,CHAPTER VII,to which they do not resort. Every rock and every quick-sand is known
11682,CHAPTER VII,to them that lurks in the vast deep. They pass a bird in flight; and
11683,CHAPTER VII,"with such unerring certainty they make to their destination, that"
11684,CHAPTER VII,"some have said that they have no need of pilot or rudder, but that"
11685,CHAPTER VII,"they move instinctively, self-directed, and know the minds of their"
11686,CHAPTER VII,"voyagers. Thus much, that you may not fear to trust yourself in one of"
11687,CHAPTER VII,our Phæacian ships. To-morrow if you please you shall launch forth.
11688,CHAPTER VII,To-day spend with us in feasting; who never can do enough when the
11689,CHAPTER VII,"gods send such visitors."""
11690,CHAPTER VII,
11691,CHAPTER VII,Ulysses acknowledged king Alcinous's bounty; and while these two royal
11692,CHAPTER VII,"personages stood interchanging courteous expressions, the heart of the"
11693,CHAPTER VII,princess Nausicaa was overcome: she had been gazing attentively upon
11694,CHAPTER VII,"her father's guest, as he delivered his speech; but when he came"
11695,CHAPTER VII,"to that part where he declared himself to be Ulysses, she blessed"
11696,CHAPTER VII,"herself, and her fortune, that in relieving a poor ship-wrecked"
11697,CHAPTER VII,"mariner, as he seemed no better, she had conferred a kindness on so"
11698,CHAPTER VII,divine a hero as he proved: and scarce waiting till her father had
11699,CHAPTER VII,"done speaking, with a cheerful countenance she addressed Ulysses,"
11700,CHAPTER VII,"bidding him be cheerful, and when he returned home, as by her father's"
11701,CHAPTER VII,"means she trusted he would shortly, sometimes to remember to whom he"
11702,CHAPTER VII,"owed his life, and who met him in the woods by the river Callicoe."
11703,CHAPTER VII,
11704,CHAPTER VII,"""Fair flower of Phæacia,"" he replied, ""so may all the gods bless me"
11705,CHAPTER VII,"with the strife of joys in that desired day, whenever I shall see it,"
11706,CHAPTER VII,as I shall always acknowledge to be indebted to your fair hand for the
11707,CHAPTER VII,"gift of life which I enjoy, and all the blessings which shall follow"
11708,CHAPTER VII,"upon my home-return. The gods give thee, Nausicaa, a princely husband;"
11709,CHAPTER VII,"and from you two spring blessings to this state."" So prayed Ulysses,"
11710,CHAPTER VII,his heart overflowing with admiration and grateful recollections of
11711,CHAPTER VII,king Alcinous's daughter.
11712,CHAPTER VII,
11713,CHAPTER VII,Then at the king's request he gave them a brief relation of all the
11714,CHAPTER VII,"adventures that had befallen him, since he launched forth from Troy:"
11715,CHAPTER VII,during which the princess Nausicaa took great delight (as ladies are
11716,CHAPTER VII,commonly taken with these kind of travellers' stories) to hear of the
11717,CHAPTER VII,"monster Polyphemus, of the men that devour each other in Læstrygonia,"
11718,CHAPTER VII,"of the enchantress Circe, of Scylla, and the rest; to which she"
11719,CHAPTER VII,"listened with a breathless attention, letting fall a shower of tears"
11720,CHAPTER VII,"from her fair eyes every now and then, when Ulysses told of some more"
11721,CHAPTER VII,than usual distressful passage in his travels: and all the rest of
11722,CHAPTER VII,"his auditors, if they had before entertained a high respect for their"
11723,CHAPTER VII,"guest, now felt their veneration increased ten-fold, when they learned"
11724,CHAPTER VII,"from his own mouth what perils, what sufferance, what endurance, of"
11725,CHAPTER VII,"evils beyond man's strength to support, this much-sustaining, almost"
11726,CHAPTER VII,"heavenly man, by the greatness of his mind, and by his invincible"
11727,CHAPTER VII,"courage, had struggled through."
11728,CHAPTER VII,
11729,CHAPTER VII,"The night was far spent before Ulysses had ended his narrative, and"
11730,CHAPTER VII,"with wishful glances he cast his eyes towards the eastern parts, which"
11731,CHAPTER VII,the sun had begun to flecker with his first red: for on the morrow
11732,CHAPTER VII,Alcinous had promised that a bark should be in readiness to convoy him
11733,CHAPTER VII,to Ithaca.
11734,CHAPTER VII,
11735,CHAPTER VII,In the morning a vessel well manned and appointed was waiting for him;
11736,CHAPTER VII,"into which the king and queen heaped presents of gold and silver,"
11737,CHAPTER VII,"massy plate, apparel, armour, and whatsoever things of cost or rarity"
11738,CHAPTER VII,they judged would be most acceptable to their guest: and the sails
11739,CHAPTER VII,"being set, Ulysses embarking with expressions of regret took his leave"
11740,CHAPTER VII,"of his royal entertainers, of the fair princess (who had been his"
11741,CHAPTER VII,"first friend,) and of the peers of Phæacia; who crowding down to the"
11742,CHAPTER VII,"beach to have the last sight of their illustrious visitant, beheld the"
11743,CHAPTER VII,"gallant ship with all her canvas spread, bounding and curvetting over"
11744,CHAPTER VII,"the waves, like a horse proud of his rider; or as if she knew that in"
11745,CHAPTER VII,her capacious womb's rich freightage she bore Ulysses.
11746,CHAPTER VII,
11747,CHAPTER VII,"He whose life past had been a series of disquiets, in seas among rude"
11748,CHAPTER VII,"waves, in battles amongst ruder foes, now slept securely, forgetting"
11749,CHAPTER VII,"all; his eye-lids bound in such deep sleep, as only yielded to death:"
11750,CHAPTER VII,"and when they reached the nearest Ithacan port by the next morning, he"
11751,CHAPTER VII,"was still asleep. The mariners not willing to awake him, landed him"
11752,CHAPTER VII,"softly, and laid him in a cave at the foot of an olive tree, which"
11753,CHAPTER VII,"made a shady recess in that narrow harbour, the haunt of almost"
11754,CHAPTER VII,"none but the sea-nymphs, which are called Naiads; few ships before"
11755,CHAPTER VII,"this Phæacian vessel having put into that haven, by reason of the"
11756,CHAPTER VII,"difficulty and narrowness of the entrance. Here leaving him asleep,"
11757,CHAPTER VII,and disposing in safe places near him the presents with which king
11758,CHAPTER VII,"Alcinous had dismissed him, they departed for Phæacia; where these"
11759,CHAPTER VII,"wretched mariners never again set foot; but just as they arrived,"
11760,CHAPTER VII,and thought to salute their country earth; in sight of their city's
11761,CHAPTER VII,"turrets, and in open view of their friends who from the harbour with"
11762,CHAPTER VII,shouts greeted their return; their vessel and all the mariners which
11763,CHAPTER VII,"were in her were turned to stone, and stood transformed and fixed in"
11764,CHAPTER VII,"sight of the whole Phæacian city, where it yet stands, by Neptune's"
11765,CHAPTER VII,vindictive wrath; who resented thus highly the contempt which those
11766,CHAPTER VII,Phæacians had shown in convoying home a man whom the god had destined
11767,CHAPTER VII,to destruction. Whence it comes to pass that the Phæacians at this day
11768,CHAPTER VII,"will at no price be induced to lend their ships to strangers, or to"
11769,CHAPTER VII,"become the carriers for other nations, so highly do they still dread"
11770,CHAPTER VII,"the displeasure of the sea-god, while they see that terrible monument"
11771,CHAPTER VII,ever in sight.
11772,CHAPTER VII,
11773,CHAPTER VII,"When Ulysses awoke, which was not till some time after the mariners"
11774,CHAPTER VII,"had departed, he did not at first know his country again, either that"
11775,CHAPTER VII,"long absence had made it strange, or that Minerva (which was more"
11776,CHAPTER VII,"likely) had cast a cloud about his eyes, that he should have greater"
11777,CHAPTER VII,pleasure hereafter in discovering his mistake: but like a man suddenly
11778,CHAPTER VII,"awaking in some desart isle, to which his sea-mates have transported"
11779,CHAPTER VII,"him in his sleep, he looked around, and discerning no known objects,"
11780,CHAPTER VII,"he cast his hands to heaven for pity, and complained on those ruthless"
11781,CHAPTER VII,men who had beguiled him with a promise of conveying him home to his
11782,CHAPTER VII,"country, and perfidiously left him to perish in an unknown land. But"
11783,CHAPTER VII,"then the rich presents of gold and silver given him by Alcinous, which"
11784,CHAPTER VII,"he saw carefully laid up in secure places near him, staggered him:"
11785,CHAPTER VII,"which seemed not like the act of wrongful or unjust men, such as turn"
11786,CHAPTER VII,"pirates for gain, or land helpless passengers in remote coasts to"
11787,CHAPTER VII,possess themselves of their goods.
11788,CHAPTER VII,
11789,CHAPTER VII,"While he remained in this suspence, there came up to him a young"
11790,CHAPTER VII,"shepherd, clad in the finer sort of apparel, such as kings' sons"
11791,CHAPTER VII,"wore in those days when princes did not disdain to tend sheep, who"
11792,CHAPTER VII,"accosting him, was saluted again by Ulysses, who asked him what"
11793,CHAPTER VII,"country that was, on which he had been just landed, and whether it"
11794,CHAPTER VII,"were part of a continent, or an island. The young shepherd made show"
11795,CHAPTER VII,"of wonder, to hear any one ask the name of that land; as country"
11796,CHAPTER VII,people are apt to esteem those for mainly ignorant and barbarous who
11797,CHAPTER VII,"do not know the names of places which are familiar to _them_, though"
11798,CHAPTER VII,"perhaps they who ask have had no opportunities of knowing, and may"
11799,CHAPTER VII,have come from far countries.
11800,CHAPTER VII,
11801,CHAPTER VII,"""I had thought,"" said he, ""that all people knew our land. It is rocky"
11802,CHAPTER VII,"and barren, to be sure; but well enough: it feeds a goat or an ox"
11803,CHAPTER VII,well; it is not wanting neither in wine or in wheat; it has good
11804,CHAPTER VII,"springs of water, some fair rivers; and wood enough, as you may see:"
11805,CHAPTER VII,"it is called Ithaca."""
11806,CHAPTER VII,
11807,CHAPTER VII,Ulysses was joyed enough to find himself in his own country; but so
11808,CHAPTER VII,"prudently he carried his joy, that dissembling his true name and"
11809,CHAPTER VII,"quality, he pretended to the shepherd that he was only some foreigner"
11810,CHAPTER VII,who by stress of weather had put into that port; and framed on the
11811,CHAPTER VII,"sudden a story to make it plausible, how he had come from Crete in"
11812,CHAPTER VII,"a ship of Phæacia; when the young shepherd laughing, and taking"
11813,CHAPTER VII,"Ulysses's hand in both his, said to him: ""He must be cunning, I find,"
11814,CHAPTER VII,"who thinks to over-reach you. What, cannot you quit your wiles and"
11815,CHAPTER VII,"your subtleties, now that you are in a state of security? must the"
11816,CHAPTER VII,first word with which you salute your native earth be an untruth? and
11817,CHAPTER VII,"think you that you are unknown?"""
11818,CHAPTER VII,
11819,CHAPTER VII,"Ulysses looked again; and he saw, not a shepherd, but a beautiful"
11820,CHAPTER VII,"woman, whom he immediately knew to be the goddess Minerva, that in the"
11821,CHAPTER VII,wars of Troy had frequently vouchsafed her sight to him; and had been
11822,CHAPTER VII,"with him since in perils, saving him unseen."
11823,CHAPTER VII,
11824,CHAPTER VII,"""Let not my ignorance offend thee, great Minerva,"" he cried, ""or move"
11825,CHAPTER VII,"thy displeasure, that in that shape I knew thee not; since the skill"
11826,CHAPTER VII,"of discerning of deities is not attainable by wit or study, but hard"
11827,CHAPTER VII,to be hit by the wisest of mortals. To know thee truly through all thy
11828,CHAPTER VII,changes is only given to those whom thou art pleased to grace. To all
11829,CHAPTER VII,men thou takest all likenesses. All men in their wits think that they
11830,CHAPTER VII,"know thee, and that they have thee. Thou art wisdom itself. But a"
11831,CHAPTER VII,"semblance of thee, which is false wisdom, often is taken for thee: so"
11832,CHAPTER VII,"thy counterfeit view appears to many, but thy true presence to few:"
11833,CHAPTER VII,"those are they which, loving thee above all, are inspired with light"
11834,CHAPTER VII,"from thee to know thee. But this I surely know, that all the time the"
11835,CHAPTER VII,"sons of Greece waged war against Troy, I was sundry times graced with"
11836,CHAPTER VII,"thy appearance; but since, I have never been able to set eyes upon"
11837,CHAPTER VII,"thee till now: but have wandered at my own discretion, to myself a"
11838,CHAPTER VII,"blind guide, erring up and down the world, wanting thee."""
11839,CHAPTER VII,
11840,CHAPTER VII,"Then Minerva cleared his eyes, and he knew the ground on which he"
11841,CHAPTER VII,"stood to be Ithaca, and that cave to be the same which the people of"
11842,CHAPTER VII,"Ithaca had in former times made sacred to the sea-nymphs, and where he"
11843,CHAPTER VII,himself had done sacrifices to them a thousand times; and full in his
11844,CHAPTER VII,view stood Mount Nerytus with all his woods: so that now he knew for a
11845,CHAPTER VII,"certainty that he was arrived in his own country, and with the delight"
11846,CHAPTER VII,which he felt he could not forbear stooping down and kissing the soil.

11859,CHAPTER VIII,briefly recounting to him the events which had taken place in Ithaca
11860,CHAPTER VIII,"during his absence, she shewed him that his way to his wife and throne"
11861,CHAPTER VIII,"did not lie so open, but that before he were reinstated in the secure"
11862,CHAPTER VIII,"possession of them, he must encounter many difficulties. His palace,"
11863,CHAPTER VIII,"wanting its king, was become the resort of insolent and imperious men,"
11864,CHAPTER VIII,"the chief nobility of Ithaca and of the neighbouring isles, who, in"
11865,CHAPTER VIII,"the confidence of Ulysses being dead, came as suitors to Penelope."
11866,CHAPTER VIII,"The queen (it was true) continued single, but was little better than"
11867,CHAPTER VIII,"a state-prisoner in the power of these men, who under a pretence of"
11868,CHAPTER VIII,"waiting her decision, occupied the king's house, rather as owners"
11869,CHAPTER VIII,"than guests, lording and domineering at their pleasure, profaning the"
11870,CHAPTER VIII,"palace, and wasting the royal substance, with their feasts and mad"
11871,CHAPTER VIII,riots. Moreover the goddess told him how fearing the attempts of these
11872,CHAPTER VIII,"lawless men upon the person of his young son Telemachus, she herself"
11873,CHAPTER VIII,"had put it into the heart of the prince, to go and seek his father in"
11874,CHAPTER VIII,far countries; how in the shape of Mentor she had borne him company in
11875,CHAPTER VIII,"his long search; which, though failing, as she meant it should fail,"
11876,CHAPTER VIII,"in its first object, had yet had this effect, that through hardships"
11877,CHAPTER VIII,"he had learned endurance, through experience he had gathered wisdom,"
11878,CHAPTER VIII,"and wherever his footsteps had been, he had left such memorials, of"
11879,CHAPTER VIII,"his worth, as the fame of Ulysses's son was already blown throughout"
11880,CHAPTER VIII,the world. That it was now not many days since Telemachus had arrived
11881,CHAPTER VIII,"in the island, to the great joy of the queen his mother, who had"
11882,CHAPTER VIII,"thought him dead, by reason of his long absence, and had begun to"
11883,CHAPTER VIII,mourn for him with a grief equal to that which she endured for
11884,CHAPTER VIII,Ulysses: the goddess herself having so ordered the course of his
11885,CHAPTER VIII,"adventures, that the time of his return should correspond with the"
11886,CHAPTER VIII,"return of Ulysses, that they might together concert measures how to"
11887,CHAPTER VIII,repress the power and insolence of those wicked suitors. This the
11888,CHAPTER VIII,"goddess told him; but of the particulars of his son's adventures, of"
11889,CHAPTER VIII,"his having been detained in the Delightful Island, which his father"
11890,CHAPTER VIII,"had so lately left, of Calypso, and her nymphs, and the many strange"
11891,CHAPTER VIII,occurrences which may be read with profit and delight in the history
11892,CHAPTER VIII,"of the prince's adventures, she forbore to tell him as yet, as judging"
11893,CHAPTER VIII,that he would hear them with greater pleasure from the lips of his
11894,CHAPTER VIII,"son, when he should have him in an hour of stillness and safety, when"
11895,CHAPTER VIII,"their work should be done, and none of their enemies left alive to"
11896,CHAPTER VIII,trouble them.
11897,CHAPTER VIII,
11898,CHAPTER VIII,"Then they sat down, the goddess and Ulysses, at the foot of a wild"
11899,CHAPTER VIII,"olive-tree, consulting how they might with safety bring about his"
11900,CHAPTER VIII,restoration. And when Ulysses revolved in his mind how that his
11901,CHAPTER VIII,"enemies were a multitude, and he single, he began to despond, and he"
11902,CHAPTER VIII,"said: ""I shall die an ill death like Agamemnon; in the threshold of my"
11903,CHAPTER VIII,"own house I shall perish, like that unfortunate monarch, slain by some"
11904,CHAPTER VIII,"one of my wife's suitors."" But then again calling to mind his ancient"
11905,CHAPTER VIII,"courage, he secretly wished that Minerva would but breathe such a"
11906,CHAPTER VIII,spirit into his bosom as she enflamed him with in the hour of Troy's
11907,CHAPTER VIII,"destruction, that he might encounter with three hundred of those"
11908,CHAPTER VIII,"impudent suitors at once, and strew the pavements of his beautiful"
11909,CHAPTER VIII,palace with their bloods and brains.
11910,CHAPTER VIII,
11911,CHAPTER VIII,"And Minerva knew his thoughts, and she said, ""I will be strongly with"
11912,CHAPTER VIII,"thee, if thou fail not to do thy part. And for a sign between us that"
11913,CHAPTER VIII,"I will perform my promise, and for a token on thy part of obedience, I"
11914,CHAPTER VIII,"must change thee, that thy person may not be known of men."""
11915,CHAPTER VIII,
11916,CHAPTER VIII,"Then Ulysses bowed his head to receive the divine impression, and"
11917,CHAPTER VIII,Minerva by her great power changed his person so that it might not be
11918,CHAPTER VIII,"known. She changed him to appearance into a very old man, yet such a"
11919,CHAPTER VIII,one as by his limbs and gait seemed to have been some considerable
11920,CHAPTER VIII,"person in his time, and to retain yet some remains of his once"
11921,CHAPTER VIII,"prodigious strength. Also, instead of those rich robes in which king"
11922,CHAPTER VIII,"Alcinous had clothed him, she threw over his limbs such old and"
11923,CHAPTER VIII,tattered rags as wandering beggars usually wear. A staff supported his
11924,CHAPTER VIII,"steps, and a scrip hung to his back, such as travelling mendicants"
11925,CHAPTER VIII,"use, to hold the scraps which are given to them at rich men's doors."
11926,CHAPTER VIII,"So from a king he became a beggar, as wise Tiresias had predicted to"
11927,CHAPTER VIII,him in the shades.
11928,CHAPTER VIII,
11929,CHAPTER VIII,"To complete his humiliation, and to prove his obedience by suffering,"
11930,CHAPTER VIII,she next directed him in this beggarly attire to go and present
11931,CHAPTER VIII,"himself to his old herdsman Eumæus, who had the care of his swine and"
11932,CHAPTER VIII,"his cattle, and had been a faithful steward to him all the time of his"
11933,CHAPTER VIII,absence. Then strictly charging Ulysses that he should reveal himself
11934,CHAPTER VIII,"to no man, but to his own son, whom she would send to him when she saw"
11935,CHAPTER VIII,"occasion, the goddess went her way."
11936,CHAPTER VIII,
11937,CHAPTER VIII,The transformed Ulysses bent his course to the cottage of the
11938,CHAPTER VIII,"herdsman, and entering in at the front court, the dogs, of which"
11939,CHAPTER VIII,"Eumæus kept many fierce ones for the protection of the cattle, flew"
11940,CHAPTER VIII,"with open mouths upon him, as those ignoble animals have oftentimes an"
11941,CHAPTER VIII,"antipathy to the sight of any thing like a beggar, and would have rent"
11942,CHAPTER VIII,"him in pieces with their teeth, if Ulysses had not had the prudence"
11943,CHAPTER VIII,"to let fall his staff, which had chiefly provoked their fury, and sat"
11944,CHAPTER VIII,himself down in a careless fashion upon the ground: but for all that
11945,CHAPTER VIII,"some serious hurt had certainly been done to him, so raging the dogs"
11946,CHAPTER VIII,"were, had not the herdsman, whom the barking of the dogs had fetched"
11947,CHAPTER VIII,"out of the house, with shouting and with throwing of stones repressed"
11948,CHAPTER VIII,them.
11949,CHAPTER VIII,
11950,CHAPTER VIII,"He said, when he saw Ulysses, ""Old father, how near you were to being"
11951,CHAPTER VIII,torn in pieces by these rude dogs! I should never have forgiven
11952,CHAPTER VIII,"myself, if through neglect of mine any hurt had happened to you. But"
11953,CHAPTER VIII,"heaven has given me so many cares to my portion, that I might well be"
11954,CHAPTER VIII,excused for not attending to every thing: while here I lie grieving
11955,CHAPTER VIII,"and mourning for the absence of that majesty which once ruled here,"
11956,CHAPTER VIII,"and am forced to fatten his swine and his cattle for food to evil men,"
11957,CHAPTER VIII,"who hate him, and who wish his death; when he perhaps strays up and"
11958,CHAPTER VIII,"down the world, and has not wherewith to appease hunger, if indeed he"
11959,CHAPTER VIII,yet lives (which is a question) and enjoys the cheerful light of the
11960,CHAPTER VIII,"sun."" This he said, little thinking that he of whom he spoke now stood"
11961,CHAPTER VIII,"before him, and that in that uncouth disguise and beggarly obscurity"
11962,CHAPTER VIII,was present the hidden majesty of Ulysses.
11963,CHAPTER VIII,
11964,CHAPTER VIII,"Then he had his guest into the house, and set meat and drink before"
11965,CHAPTER VIII,"him; and Ulysses said, ""May Jove and all the other gods requite you"
11966,CHAPTER VIII,"for the kind speeches and hospitable usage which you have shewn me!"""
11967,CHAPTER VIII,
11968,CHAPTER VIII,"Eumæus made answer, ""My poor guest, if one in much worse plight than"
11969,CHAPTER VIII,"yourself had arrived here, it were a shame to such scanty means as I"
11970,CHAPTER VIII,"have, if I had let him depart without entertaining him to the best of"
11971,CHAPTER VIII,"my ability. Poor men, and such as have no houses of their own, are by"
11972,CHAPTER VIII,Jove himself recommended to our care. But the cheer which we that are
11973,CHAPTER VIII,"servants to other men have to bestow, is but sorry at most, yet freely"
11974,CHAPTER VIII,"and lovingly I give it you. Indeed there once ruled here a man, whose"
11975,CHAPTER VIII,"return the gods have set their faces against, who, if he had been"
11976,CHAPTER VIII,"suffered to reign in peace and grow old among us, would have been kind"
11977,CHAPTER VIII,to me and mine. But he is gone; and for his sake would to God that the
11978,CHAPTER VIII,"whole posterity of Helen might perish with her, since in her quarrel"
11979,CHAPTER VIII,"so many worthies have perished. But such as your fare is, eat it,"
11980,CHAPTER VIII,and be welcome; such lean beasts as are food for poor herdsmen. The
11981,CHAPTER VIII,fattest go to feed the voracious stomachs of the queen's suitors.
11982,CHAPTER VIII,"Shame on their unworthiness, there is no day in which two or three"
11983,CHAPTER VIII,of the noblest of the herd are not slain to support their feasts and
11984,CHAPTER VIII,"their surfeits."""
11985,CHAPTER VIII,
11986,CHAPTER VIII,"Ulysses gave good ear to his words, and as he ate his meat, he even"
11987,CHAPTER VIII,"tore it and rent it with his teeth, for mere vexation that his fat"
11988,CHAPTER VIII,cattle should be slain to glut the appetites of those godless suitors.
11989,CHAPTER VIII,"And he said, ""What chief or what ruler is this, that thou commendest"
11990,CHAPTER VIII,"so highly, and sayest that he perished at Troy? I am but a stranger in"
11991,CHAPTER VIII,"these parts. It may be I have heard of some such in my long travels."""
11992,CHAPTER VIII,
11993,CHAPTER VIII,"Eumæus answered, ""Old father, never any one of all the strangers"
11994,CHAPTER VIII,"that have come to our coast with news of Ulysses being alive, could"
11995,CHAPTER VIII,"gain credit with the queen or her son yet. These travellers, to get"
11996,CHAPTER VIII,"raiment or a meal, will not stick to invent any lie. Truth is not the"
11997,CHAPTER VIII,commodity they deal in. Never did the queen get any thing of them but
11998,CHAPTER VIII,"lies. She receives all that come graciously, hears their stories,"
11999,CHAPTER VIII,"enquires all she can, but all ends in tears and dissatisfaction. But"
12000,CHAPTER VIII,"in God's name, old father, if you have got a tale, make the most on't,"
12001,CHAPTER VIII,it may gain you a cloak or a coat from somebody to keep you warm: but
12002,CHAPTER VIII,"for him who is the subject of it, dogs and vultures long since have"
12003,CHAPTER VIII,"torn him limb from limb, or some great fish at sea has devoured him,"
12004,CHAPTER VIII,or he lieth with no better monument upon his bones than the sea-sand.
12005,CHAPTER VIII,But for me past all the race of men were tears created: for I never
12006,CHAPTER VIII,shall find so kind a royal master more; not if my father or my mother
12007,CHAPTER VIII,"could come again and visit me from the tomb, would my eyes be so"
12008,CHAPTER VIII,"blessed, as they should be with the sight of him again, coming as from"
12009,CHAPTER VIII,"the dead. In his last rest my soul shall love him. He is not here, nor"
12010,CHAPTER VIII,"do I name him as a flatterer, but because I am thankful for his love"
12011,CHAPTER VIII,and care which he had to me a poor man; and if I knew surely that he
12012,CHAPTER VIII,"were past all shores that the sun shines upon, I would invoke him as a"
12013,CHAPTER VIII,"deified thing."""
12014,CHAPTER VIII,
12015,CHAPTER VIII,"For this saying of Eumæus the waters stood in Ulysses's eyes, and he"
12016,CHAPTER VIII,"said, ""My friend, to say and to affirm positively that he cannot be"
12017,CHAPTER VIII,"alive, is to give too much licence to incredulity. For, not to speak"
12018,CHAPTER VIII,"at random, but with as much solemnity as an oath comes to, I say to"
12019,CHAPTER VIII,"you that Ulysses shall return, and whenever that day shall be, then"
12020,CHAPTER VIII,"shall you give to me a cloak and a coat; but till then, I will not"
12021,CHAPTER VIII,"receive so much as a thread of a garment, but rather go naked; for"
12022,CHAPTER VIII,"no less than the gates of hell do I hate that man, whom poverty can"
12023,CHAPTER VIII,"force to tell an untruth. Be Jove then witness to my words, that this"
12024,CHAPTER VIII,"very year, nay ere this month be fully ended, your eyes shall behold"
12025,CHAPTER VIII,"Ulysses, dealing vengeance in his own palace upon the wrongers of his"
12026,CHAPTER VIII,"wife and his son."""
12027,CHAPTER VIII,
12028,CHAPTER VIII,"To give the better credence to his words, he amused Eumæus with a"
12029,CHAPTER VIII,"forged story of his life, feigning of himself that he was a Cretan"
12030,CHAPTER VIII,"born, and one that went with Idomeneus to the wars of Troy. Also he"
12031,CHAPTER VIII,"said that he knew Ulysses, and related various passages which he"
12032,CHAPTER VIII,"alleged to have happened betwixt Ulysses and himself, which were"
12033,CHAPTER VIII,"either true in the main, as having really happened between Ulysses and"
12034,CHAPTER VIII,"some other person, or were so like to truth, as corresponding with the"
12035,CHAPTER VIII,"known character and actions of Ulysses, that Eumæus's incredulity was"
12036,CHAPTER VIII,not a little shaken. Among other things he asserted that he had lately
12037,CHAPTER VIII,"been entertained in the court of Thesprotia, where the king's son of"
12038,CHAPTER VIII,"the country had told him, that Ulysses had been there but just before"
12039,CHAPTER VIII,"him, and was gone upon a voyage to the oracle of Jove in Dodona,"
12040,CHAPTER VIII,"whence he should shortly return, and a ship would be ready by the"
12041,CHAPTER VIII,"bounty of the Thesprotians to convoy him straight to Ithaca. ""And in"
12042,CHAPTER VIII,"token that what I tell you is true,"" said Ulysses, ""if your king come"
12043,CHAPTER VIII,"not within the period which I have named, you shall have leave to"
12044,CHAPTER VIII,"give your servants commandment to take my old carcase, and throw it"
12045,CHAPTER VIII,"headlong from some steep rock into the sea, that poor men, taking"
12046,CHAPTER VIII,"example by me, may fear to lie."" But Eumæus made answer that that"
12047,CHAPTER VIII,should be small satisfaction or pleasure to him.
12048,CHAPTER VIII,
12049,CHAPTER VIII,"So while they sat discoursing in this manner, supper was served in,"
12050,CHAPTER VIII,"and the servants of the herdsman, who had been out all day in the"
12051,CHAPTER VIII,"fields, came in to supper, and took their seats at the fire, for the"
12052,CHAPTER VIII,"night was bitter and frosty. After supper, Ulysses, who had well"
12053,CHAPTER VIII,"eaten and drunken, and was refreshed with the herdsman's good cheer,"
12054,CHAPTER VIII,was resolved to try whether his host's hospitality would extend
12055,CHAPTER VIII,to the lending him a good warm mantle or rug to cover him in the
12056,CHAPTER VIII,"night-season; and framing an artful tale for the purpose, in a merry"
12057,CHAPTER VIII,"mood, filling a cup of Greek wine, he thus began:"
12058,CHAPTER VIII,
12059,CHAPTER VIII,"""I will tell you a story of your king Ulysses and myself. If there is"
12060,CHAPTER VIII,"ever a time when a man may have leave to tell his own stories, it is"
12061,CHAPTER VIII,"when he has drunken a little too much. Strong liquor driveth the fool,"
12062,CHAPTER VIII,"and moves even the heart of the wise, moves and impels him to sing"
12063,CHAPTER VIII,"and to dance, and break forth in pleasant laughters, and perchance to"
12064,CHAPTER VIII,"prefer a speech too which were better kept in. When the heart is open,"
12065,CHAPTER VIII,the tongue will be stirring. But you shall hear. We led our powers to
12066,CHAPTER VIII,"ambush once under the walls of Troy."""
12067,CHAPTER VIII,
12068,CHAPTER VIII,The herdsmen crowded about him eager to hear any thing which related
12069,CHAPTER VIII,"to their king Ulysses and the wars of Troy, and thus he went on:"
12070,CHAPTER VIII,
12071,CHAPTER VIII,"""I remember, Ulysses and Menelaus had the direction of that"
12072,CHAPTER VIII,"enterprise, and they were pleased to join me with them in the command."
12073,CHAPTER VIII,"I was at that time in some repute among men, though fortune has played"
12074,CHAPTER VIII,"me a trick since, as you may perceive. But I was somebody in those"
12075,CHAPTER VIII,"times, and could do something. Be that as it may, a bitter freezing"
12076,CHAPTER VIII,"night it was, such a night as this, the air cut like steel, and the"
12077,CHAPTER VIII,sleet gathered on our shields like crystal. There was some twenty
12078,CHAPTER VIII,"of us, that lay close couched down among the reeds and bull-rushes"
12079,CHAPTER VIII,that grew in the moat that goes round the city. The rest of us made
12080,CHAPTER VIII,"tolerable shift, for every man had been careful to bring with him a"
12081,CHAPTER VIII,good cloak or mantle to wrap over his armour and keep himself warm;
12082,CHAPTER VIII,"but I, as it chanced, had left my cloak behind me, as not expecting"
12083,CHAPTER VIII,"that the night would prove so cool, or rather I believe because I had"
12084,CHAPTER VIII,"at that time a brave suit of new armour on, which, being a soldier,"
12085,CHAPTER VIII,"and having some of the soldier's vice about me, _vanity_, I was not"
12086,CHAPTER VIII,willing should be hidden under a cloak; but I paid for my indiscretion
12087,CHAPTER VIII,"with my sufferings, for with the inclement night, and the wet of the"
12088,CHAPTER VIII,"ditch in which we lay, I was well nigh frozen to death; and when I"
12089,CHAPTER VIII,"could endure no longer, I jogged Ulysses who was next to me, and had"
12090,CHAPTER VIII,"a nimble ear, and made known my case to him, assuring him that I must"
12091,CHAPTER VIII,"inevitably perish. He answered in a low whisper, 'Hush, lest any Greek"
12092,CHAPTER VIII,"should hear you, and take notice of your softness.' Not a word more"
12093,CHAPTER VIII,"he said, but shewed as if he had no pity for the plight I was in. But"
12094,CHAPTER VIII,"he was as considerate as he was brave, and even then, as he lay with"
12095,CHAPTER VIII,"his head reposing upon his hand, he was meditating how to relieve me,"
12096,CHAPTER VIII,without exposing my weakness to the soldiers. At last raising up his
12097,CHAPTER VIII,"head, he made as if he had been asleep, and said, 'Friends, I have"
12098,CHAPTER VIII,been warned in a dream to send to the fleet to king Agamemnon for a
12099,CHAPTER VIII,"supply, to recruit our numbers, for we are not sufficient for this"
12100,CHAPTER VIII,"enterprize;' and they believing him, one Thoas was dispatched on"
12101,CHAPTER VIII,"that errand, who departing, for more speed, as Ulysses had foreseen,"
12102,CHAPTER VIII,"left his upper garment behind him, a good warm mantle, to which I"
12103,CHAPTER VIII,"succeeded, and by the help of it got through the night with credit."
12104,CHAPTER VIII,"This shift Ulysses made for one in need, and would to heaven that I"
12105,CHAPTER VIII,"had now that strength in my limbs, which made me in those days to be"
12106,CHAPTER VIII,accounted fit to be a leader under Ulysses! I should not then want the
12107,CHAPTER VIII,"loan of a cloak or a mantle, to wrap about me and shield my old limbs"
12108,CHAPTER VIII,"from the night-air."""
12109,CHAPTER VIII,
12110,CHAPTER VIII,"The tale pleased the herdsmen; and Eumæus, who more than all the rest"
12111,CHAPTER VIII,"was gratified to hear tales of Ulysses, true or false, said, that for"
12112,CHAPTER VIII,"his story he deserved a mantle, and a night's lodging, which he should"
12113,CHAPTER VIII,have; and he spread for him a bed of goat and sheep skins by the fire;
12114,CHAPTER VIII,"and the seeming beggar, who was indeed the true Ulysses, lay down and"
12115,CHAPTER VIII,"slept under that poor roof, in that abject disguise to which the will"
12116,CHAPTER VIII,of Minerva had subjected him.
12117,CHAPTER VIII,
12118,CHAPTER VIII,"When morning was come, Ulysses made offer to depart, as if he were not"
12119,CHAPTER VIII,"willing to burthen his host's hospitality any longer, but said, that"
12120,CHAPTER VIII,"he would go and try the humanity of the town's folk, if any there"
12121,CHAPTER VIII,would bestow upon him a bit of bread or a cup of drink. Perhaps the
12122,CHAPTER VIII,queen's suitors (he said) out of their full feasts would bestow a
12123,CHAPTER VIII,"scrap on him: for he could wait at table, if need were, and play the"
12124,CHAPTER VIII,"nimble serving-man, he could fetch wood (he said) or build a fire,"
12125,CHAPTER VIII,"prepare roast meat or boiled, mix the wine with water, or do any of"
12126,CHAPTER VIII,those offices which recommended poor men like him to services in great
12127,CHAPTER VIII,men's houses.
12128,CHAPTER VIII,
12129,CHAPTER VIII,"""Alas! poor guest,"" said Eumæus, ""you know not what you speak. What"

12131,CHAPTER VIII,light minds are not given to such grave servitors. They must have
12132,CHAPTER VIII,"youths, richly tricked out in flowing vests, with curled hair, like so"
12133,CHAPTER VIII,"many of Jove's cup-bearers, to fill out the wine to them as they sit"
12134,CHAPTER VIII,"at table, and to shift their trenchers. Their gorged insolence would"

12138,CHAPTER VIII,
12139,CHAPTER VIII,"As he spake these words, the steps of one crossing the front court"
12140,CHAPTER VIII,"were heard, and a noise of the dogs fawning and leaping about as for"
12141,CHAPTER VIII,"joy; by which token Eumæus guessed that it was the prince, who hearing"
12142,CHAPTER VIII,of a traveller being arrived at Eumæus's cottage that brought tidings
12143,CHAPTER VIII,"of his father, was come to search the truth, and Eumæus said: ""It is"

12145,CHAPTER VIII,"well speak the words, the prince was at the door, whom Ulysses rising"
12146,CHAPTER VIII,"to receive, Telemachus would not suffer that so aged a man, as he"
12147,CHAPTER VIII,"appeared, should rise to do respect to him, but he courteously and"
12148,CHAPTER VIII,"reverently took him by the hand, and inclined his head to him, as if"
12149,CHAPTER VIII,he had surely known that it was his father indeed: but Ulysses covered
12150,CHAPTER VIII,"his eyes with his hands, that he might not shew the waters which stood"
12151,CHAPTER VIII,"in them. And Telemachus said, ""Is this the man who can tell us tidings"

12167,CHAPTER VIII,
12168,CHAPTER VIII,"Ulysses answered: ""Since it is free for any man to speak in presence"

12174,CHAPTER VIII,ill will towards you from your people? or do you mistrust your

12193,CHAPTER VIII,"the goddess, and durst not bark, but went crouching and licking of the"

12367,CHAPTER IX,"to curry favor with the suitors, and recommend himself especially to"
12368,CHAPTER IX,"such a great lord as Antinous was, began to revile and scorn Ulysses,"
12369,CHAPTER IX,"putting foul language upon him, and fairly challenging him to fight"

12371,CHAPTER IX,than jealousy and that envious disposition which beggars commonly
12372,CHAPTER IX,"manifest to brothers in their trade, mildly besought him not to"
12373,CHAPTER IX,"trouble him, but to enjoy that portion which the liberality of their"

12380,CHAPTER IX,"the notice of the suitors, who with loud laughters and shouting egged"
12381,CHAPTER IX,"on the dispute, and lord Antinous swore by all the gods it should be a"
12382,CHAPTER IX,"battle, and that in that hall the strife should be determined. To this"
12383,CHAPTER IX,"the rest of the suitors with violent clamours acceded, and a circle"
12384,CHAPTER IX,"was made for the combatants, and a fat goat was proposed as the"
12385,CHAPTER IX,"victor's prize, as at the Olympic or the Pythian games. Then Ulysses"
12386,CHAPTER IX,"seeing no remedy, or being not unwilling that the suitors should"
12387,CHAPTER IX,behold some proof of that strength which ere long in their own persons
12388,CHAPTER IX,"they were to taste of, stripped himself, and prepared for the combat."
12389,CHAPTER IX,"But first he demanded that he should have fair play shewn him, that"

12409,CHAPTER IX,"their ears and noses and give them to the dogs to tear. So Irus,"
12410,CHAPTER IX,"in whom fear of king Echetus prevailed above the fear of Ulysses,"
12411,CHAPTER IX,"addressed himself to fight. But Ulysses, provoked to be engaged in so"
12412,CHAPTER IX,"odious a strife with a fellow of his base conditions, and loathing"
12413,CHAPTER IX,"longer to be made a spectacle to entertain the eyes of his foes, with"
12414,CHAPTER IX,"one blow, which he struck him beneath the ear, so shattered the teeth"
12415,CHAPTER IX,"and jaw bone of this soon baffled coward, that he laid him sprawling"
12416,CHAPTER IX,"in the dust, with small stomach or ability to renew the contest. Then"
12417,CHAPTER IX,"raising him on his feet, he led him bleeding and sputtering to the"
12418,CHAPTER IX,"door, and put his staff into his hand, and bid him go use his command"
12419,CHAPTER IX,"upon dogs and swine, but not presume himself to be lord of the guests"
12420,CHAPTER IX,"another time, nor of the beggary!"
12421,CHAPTER IX,
12422,CHAPTER IX,"The suitors applauded in their vain minds the issue of the contest,"
12423,CHAPTER IX,"and rioted in mirth at the expense of poor Irus, who they vowed should"
12424,CHAPTER IX,"be forthwith embarked, and sent to king Echetus; and they bestowed"
12425,CHAPTER IX,"thanks on Ulysses for ridding the court of that unsavory morsel, as"
12426,CHAPTER IX,they called him; but in their inward souls they would not have cared
12427,CHAPTER IX,"if Irus had been victor, and Ulysses had taken the foil, but it was"
12428,CHAPTER IX,mirth to them to see the beggars fight. In such pastimes and light
12429,CHAPTER IX,entertainments the day wore away.
12430,CHAPTER IX,
12431,CHAPTER IX,When evening was come the suitors betook themselves to music and
12432,CHAPTER IX,dancing. And Ulysses leaned his back against a pillar from which
12433,CHAPTER IX,"certain lamps hung which gave light to the dancers, and he made show"
12434,CHAPTER IX,"of watching the dancers, but very different thoughts were in his head."
12435,CHAPTER IX,"And as he stood near the lamps, the light fell upon his head, which"
12436,CHAPTER IX,"was thin of hair and bald, as an old man's. And Eurymachus, a suitor,"
12437,CHAPTER IX,"taking occasion from some words which were spoken before, scoffed and"
12438,CHAPTER IX,"said, ""Now I know for a certainty that some god lurks under the poor"
12439,CHAPTER IX,"and beggarly appearance of this man, for as he stands by the lamps,"
12440,CHAPTER IX,"his sleek head throws beams around it, like as it were a glory."" And"
12441,CHAPTER IX,"another said, ""He passes his time too not much unlike the gods, lazily"
12442,CHAPTER IX,"living exempt from labour, taking offerings of men."" ""I warrant,"" said"
12443,CHAPTER IX,"Eurymachus again, ""he could not raise a fence or dig a ditch for his"
12444,CHAPTER IX,"livelihood, if a man would hire him to work in a garden."""
12445,CHAPTER IX,
12446,CHAPTER IX,"""I wish,"" said Ulysses, ""that you who speak this, and myself, were to"
12447,CHAPTER IX,"be tried at any task-work, that I had a good crooked scythe put in"
12448,CHAPTER IX,"my hand, that was sharp and strong, and you such another, where the"
12449,CHAPTER IX,"grass grew longest, to be up by day-break, mowing the meadows till"
12450,CHAPTER IX,"the sun went down, not tasting of food till we had finished, or that"
12451,CHAPTER IX,"we were set to plough four acres in one day of good glebe land, to"
12452,CHAPTER IX,"see whose furrows were evenest and cleanest, or that we might have"
12453,CHAPTER IX,"one wrestling-bout together, or that in our right hands a good"
12454,CHAPTER IX,"steel-headed lance were placed, to try whose blows fell heaviest and"
12455,CHAPTER IX,"thickest upon the adversary's head-piece. I would cause you such work,"
12456,CHAPTER IX,as you should have small reason to reproach me with being slack at
12457,CHAPTER IX,"work. But you would do well to spare me this reproach, and to save"
12458,CHAPTER IX,"your strength, till the owner of this house shall return, till the"
12459,CHAPTER IX,"day when Ulysses shall return, when returning he shall enter upon his"
12460,CHAPTER IX,"birth-right."""
12461,CHAPTER IX,
12462,CHAPTER IX,"This was a galling speech to those suitors, to whom Ulysses's return"
12463,CHAPTER IX,was indeed the thing which they most dreaded; and a sudden fear fell
12464,CHAPTER IX,"upon their souls, as if they were sensible of the real presence of"
12465,CHAPTER IX,"that man who did indeed stand amongst them, but not in that form as"
12466,CHAPTER IX,"they might know him; and Eurymachus, incensed, snatched a massy cup"
12467,CHAPTER IX,"which stood on a table near, and hurled it at the head of the supposed"
12468,CHAPTER IX,"beggar, and but narrowly missed the hitting of him; and all the"
12469,CHAPTER IX,"suitors rose, as at once, to thrust him out of the hall, which they"
12470,CHAPTER IX,said his beggarly presence and his rude speeches had profaned. But
12471,CHAPTER IX,"Telemachus cried to them to forbear, and not to presume to lay hands"
12472,CHAPTER IX,upon a wretched man to whom he had promised protection. He asked if
12473,CHAPTER IX,"they were mad, to mix such abhorred uproar with his feasts. He bade"
12474,CHAPTER IX,"them take their food and their wine, to sit up or to go to bed at"
12475,CHAPTER IX,"their free pleasures, so long as he should give licence to that"
12476,CHAPTER IX,"freedom; but why should they abuse his banquet, or let the words which"
12477,CHAPTER IX,a poor beggar spake have power to move their spleens so fiercely?
12478,CHAPTER IX,
12479,CHAPTER IX,"They bit their lips and frowned for anger, to be checked so by a"
12480,CHAPTER IX,"youth; nevertheless for that time they had the grace to abstain,"
12481,CHAPTER IX,"either for shame, or that Minerva had infused into them a terror of"
12482,CHAPTER IX,Ulysses's son.
12483,CHAPTER IX,
12484,CHAPTER IX,"So that day's feast was concluded without bloodshed, and the suitors,"
12485,CHAPTER IX,"tired with their sports, departed severally each man to his apartment."
12486,CHAPTER IX,"Only Ulysses and Telemachus remained. And now Telemachus, by his"
12487,CHAPTER IX,father's direction went and brought down into the hall armour and
12488,CHAPTER IX,"lances from the armoury: for Ulysses said, ""On the morrow we shall"
12489,CHAPTER IX,"have need of them."" And moreover he said, ""If any one shall ask why"
12490,CHAPTER IX,"you have taken them down, say, it is to clean them and scour them from"
12491,CHAPTER IX,the rust which they have gathered since the owner of this house went
12492,CHAPTER IX,"for Troy."" And as Telemachus stood by the armour, the lights were all"
12493,CHAPTER IX,"gone out, and it was pitch-dark, and the armour gave out glistening"
12494,CHAPTER IX,"beams as of fire, and he said to his father, ""The pillars of the house"
12495,CHAPTER IX,"are on fire."" And his father said, ""It is the gods who sit above the"
12496,CHAPTER IX,"stars, and have power to make the night as light as the day."" And"
12497,CHAPTER IX,he took it for a good omen. And Telemachus fell to cleaning and
12498,CHAPTER IX,sharpening of the lances.
12499,CHAPTER IX,
12500,CHAPTER IX,Now Ulysses had not seen his wife Penelope in all the time since his
12501,CHAPTER IX,return; for the queen did not care to mingle with the suitors at their
12502,CHAPTER IX,"banquets, but, as became one that had been Ulysses's wife, kept much"
12503,CHAPTER IX,"in private, spinning and doing her excellent housewiveries among her"
12504,CHAPTER IX,maids in the remote apartments of the palace. Only upon solemn days
12505,CHAPTER IX,she would come down and shew herself to the suitors. And Ulysses was
12506,CHAPTER IX,"filled with a longing desire to see his wife again, whom for twenty"
12507,CHAPTER IX,"years he had not beheld, and he softly stole through the known"
12508,CHAPTER IX,"passages of his beautiful house, till he came where the maids were"
12509,CHAPTER IX,"lighting the queen through a stately gallery, that led to the chamber"
12510,CHAPTER IX,"where she slept. And when the maids saw Ulysses, they said, ""It is"
12511,CHAPTER IX,"the beggar who came to the court to-day, about whom all that uproar"
12512,CHAPTER IX,"was stirred up in the hall: what does he here?"" But Penelope gave"
12513,CHAPTER IX,"commandment that he should be brought before her, for she said, ""It"
12514,CHAPTER IX,"may be that he has travelled, and has heard something concerning"
12515,CHAPTER IX,"Ulysses."""
12516,CHAPTER IX,
12517,CHAPTER IX,"Then was Ulysses right glad to hear himself named by his queen, to"
12518,CHAPTER IX,"find himself in no wise forgotten, nor her great love towards him"
12519,CHAPTER IX,decayed in all that time that he had been away. And he stood before
12520,CHAPTER IX,"his queen, and she knew him not to be Ulysses, but supposed that he"
12521,CHAPTER IX,had been some poor traveller. And she asked him of what country he
12522,CHAPTER IX,was.
12523,CHAPTER IX,
12524,CHAPTER IX,He told her (as he had before told to Eumæus) that he was a Cretan
12525,CHAPTER IX,"born, and however poor and cast down he now seemed, no less a man than"
12526,CHAPTER IX,"brother to Idomeneus, who was grandson to king Minos, and though he"
12527,CHAPTER IX,"now wanted bread, he had once had it in his power to feast Ulysses."
12528,CHAPTER IX,"Then he feigned how Ulysses, sailing for Troy, was forced by stress"
12529,CHAPTER IX,"of weather to put his fleet in at a port of Crete, where for twelve"
12530,CHAPTER IX,"days he was his guest, and entertained by him with all befitting"
12531,CHAPTER IX,"guest-rites. And he described the very garments which Ulysses had on,"
12532,CHAPTER IX,by which Penelope knew that he had seen her lord.
12533,CHAPTER IX,
12534,CHAPTER IX,"In this manner Ulysses told his wife many tales of himself, at most"
12535,CHAPTER IX,"but painting, but painting so near to the life, that the feeling of"
12536,CHAPTER IX,"that which she took at her ears became so strong, that the kindly"
12537,CHAPTER IX,"tears ran down her fair cheeks, while she thought upon her lord, dead"
12538,CHAPTER IX,"as she thought him, and heavily mourned the loss of him whom she"
12539,CHAPTER IX,"missed, whom she could not find, though in very deed he stood so near"
12540,CHAPTER IX,her.
12541,CHAPTER IX,
12542,CHAPTER IX,"Ulysses was moved to see her weep, but he kept his own eyes as dry as"
12543,CHAPTER IX,"iron or horn in their lids, putting a bridle upon his strong passion,"
12544,CHAPTER IX,that it should not issue to sight.
12545,CHAPTER IX,
12546,CHAPTER IX,"Then told he how he had lately been at the court of Thesprotia, and"
12547,CHAPTER IX,"what he had learned concerning Ulysses there, in order as he had"
12548,CHAPTER IX,delivered to Eumæus: and Penelope was won to believe that there might
12549,CHAPTER IX,"be a possibility of Ulysses being alive, and she said, ""I dreamed a"
12550,CHAPTER IX,dream this morning. Methought I had twenty household fowl which did
12551,CHAPTER IX,"eat wheat steeped in water from my hand, and there came suddenly from"
12552,CHAPTER IX,"the clouds a crook-beaked hawk who soused on them and killed them all,"
12553,CHAPTER IX,"trussing their necks, then took his flight back up to the clouds. And"
12554,CHAPTER IX,"in my dream methought that I wept and made great moan for my fowls,"
12555,CHAPTER IX,and for the destruction which the hawk had made; and my maids came
12556,CHAPTER IX,about me to comfort me. And in the height of my griefs the hawk came
12557,CHAPTER IX,"back, and lighting upon the beam of my chamber, he said to me in a"
12558,CHAPTER IX,"man's voice, which sounded strangely even in my dream, to hear a hawk"
12559,CHAPTER IX,"to speak: Be of good cheer, he said, O daughter of Icarius! for this"
12560,CHAPTER IX,"is no dream which thou hast seen, but that which shall happen to thee"
12561,CHAPTER IX,"indeed. Those household fowl which thou lamentest so without reason,"
12562,CHAPTER IX,"are the suitors who devour thy substance, even as thou sawest the fowl"
12563,CHAPTER IX,"eat from thy hand, and the hawk is thy husband, who is coming to give"
12564,CHAPTER IX,"death to the suitors.--And I awoke, and went to see to my fowls if"
12565,CHAPTER IX,"they were alive, whom I found eating wheat from their troughs, all"
12566,CHAPTER IX,"well and safe as before my dream."""
12567,CHAPTER IX,
12568,CHAPTER IX,"Then said Ulysses, ""This dream can endure no other interpretation than"
12569,CHAPTER IX,"that which the hawk gave to it, who is your lord, and who is coming"
12570,CHAPTER IX,"quickly to effect all that his words told you."""
12571,CHAPTER IX,
12572,CHAPTER IX,"""Your words,"" she said, ""my old guest, are so sweet, that would you"
12573,CHAPTER IX,"sit and please me with your speech, my ears would never let my eyes"
12574,CHAPTER IX,close their spheres for very joy of your discourse; but none that is
12575,CHAPTER IX,"merely mortal can live without the death of sleep, so the gods who are"
12576,CHAPTER IX,"without death themselves have ordained it, to keep the memory of our"
12577,CHAPTER IX,"mortality in our minds, while we experience that as much as we live"
12578,CHAPTER IX,"we die every day: in which consideration I will ascend my bed, which"
12579,CHAPTER IX,I have nightly watered with my tears since he that was the joy of it
12580,CHAPTER IX,"departed for that bad city:"" she so speaking, because she could not"
12581,CHAPTER IX,bring her lips to name the name of Troy so much hated. So for that
12582,CHAPTER IX,"night they parted, Penelope to her bed, and Ulysses to his son, and"
12583,CHAPTER IX,"to the armour and the lances in the hall, where they sat up all night"
12584,CHAPTER IX,cleaning and watching by the armour.

12593,CHAPTER X,conclusion._
12594,CHAPTER X,
12595,CHAPTER X,
12596,CHAPTER X,"When daylight appeared, a tumultuous concourse of the suitors again"
12597,CHAPTER X,"filled the hall; and some wondered, and some inquired what meant that"
12598,CHAPTER X,glittering store of armour and lances which lay on heaps by the entry
12599,CHAPTER X,"of the door; and [to] all that asked Telemachus made reply, that he"
12600,CHAPTER X,had caused them to be taken down to cleanse them of the rust and of
12601,CHAPTER X,"the stain which they had contracted by lying so long unused, even ever"
12602,CHAPTER X,since his father went for Troy; and with that answer their minds were
12603,CHAPTER X,easily satisfied. So to their feasting and vain rioting again they
12604,CHAPTER X,fell. Ulysses by Telemachus's order had a seat and a mess assigned him
12605,CHAPTER X,"in the door-way, and he had his eye ever on the lances. And it moved"
12606,CHAPTER X,"gall in some of the great ones there present, to have their feast"
12607,CHAPTER X,still dulled with the society of that wretched beggar as they deemed
12608,CHAPTER X,"him, and they reviled and spurned at him with their feet. Only there"
12609,CHAPTER X,"was one Philætius, who had something a better nature than the rest,"
12610,CHAPTER X,"that spake kindly to him, and had his age in respect. He coming up"
12611,CHAPTER X,"to Ulysses, took him by the hand with a kind of fear, as if touched"
12612,CHAPTER X,"exceedingly with imagination of his great worth, and said thus to him,"
12613,CHAPTER X,"""Hail! father stranger! my brows have sweat to see the injuries which"
12614,CHAPTER X,"you have received, and my eyes have broke forth in tears, when I have"
12615,CHAPTER X,"only thought that such being oftentimes the lot of worthiest men, to"
12616,CHAPTER X,"this plight Ulysses may be reduced, and that he now may wander from"
12617,CHAPTER X,place to place as you do; for such who are compelled by need to range
12618,CHAPTER X,"here and there, and have no firm home to fix their feet upon, God"
12619,CHAPTER X,"keeps them in this earth, as under water; so are they kept down and"
12620,CHAPTER X,"depressed. And a dark thread is sometimes spun in the fates of kings."""
12621,CHAPTER X,
12622,CHAPTER X,"At this bare likening of the beggar to Ulysses, Minerva from heaven"
12623,CHAPTER X,"made the suitors for foolish joy to go mad, and roused them to such a"
12624,CHAPTER X,"laughter as would never stop, they laughed without power of ceasing,"
12625,CHAPTER X,their eyes stood full of tears for violent joys; but fears and
12626,CHAPTER X,horrible misgivings succeeded: and one among them stood up and
12627,CHAPTER X,"prophesied: ""Ah, wretches!"" he said, ""what madness from heaven has"
12628,CHAPTER X,"seized you, that you can laugh? see you not that your meat drops"
12629,CHAPTER X,"blood? a night, like the night of death, wraps you about, you shriek"
12630,CHAPTER X,"without knowing it; your eyes thrust forth tears; the fixed walls, and"
12631,CHAPTER X,"the beam that bears the whole house up, fall blood; ghosts choak up"
12632,CHAPTER X,"the entry; full is the hall with apparitions, of murdered men; under"
12633,CHAPTER X,your feet is hell; the sun falls from heaven and it is midnight at
12634,CHAPTER X,"noon."" But like men whom the gods had infatuated to their destruction,"
12635,CHAPTER X,"they mocked at his fears, and Eurymachus said, ""This man is surely"
12636,CHAPTER X,"mad, conduct him forth into the market-place, set him in the light,"
12637,CHAPTER X,"for he dreams that 'tis night within the house."""
12638,CHAPTER X,
12639,CHAPTER X,But Theoclymenus (for that was the prophet's name) whom Minerva had
12640,CHAPTER X,"graced with a prophetic spirit, that he foreseeing might avoid the"
12641,CHAPTER X,"destruction which awaited them, answered and said: ""Eurymachus, I will"
12642,CHAPTER X,"not require a guide of thee for I have eyes and ears, the use of both"
12643,CHAPTER X,"my feet, and a sane mind within me, and with these I will go forth of"
12644,CHAPTER X,the doors because I know the imminent evils which await all you that
12645,CHAPTER X,"stay, by reason of this poor guest who is a favourite with all the"
12646,CHAPTER X,"gods."" So saying he turned his back upon those inhospitable men, and"
12647,CHAPTER X,"went away home, and never returned to the palace."
12648,CHAPTER X,
12649,CHAPTER X,"These words which he spoke were not unheard by Telemachus, who kept"
12650,CHAPTER X,"still his eye upon his father, expecting fervently when he would give"
12651,CHAPTER X,"the sign, which was to precede the slaughter of the suitors."
12652,CHAPTER X,
12653,CHAPTER X,"They dreaming of no such thing, fell sweetly to their dinner, as"
12654,CHAPTER X,joying in the great store of banquet which was heaped in full tables
12655,CHAPTER X,about them; but there reigned not a bitterer banquet planet in all
12656,CHAPTER X,"heaven, than that which hung over them this day by secret destination"
12657,CHAPTER X,of Minerva.
12658,CHAPTER X,
12659,CHAPTER X,There was a bow which Ulysses left when he went for Troy. It had lain
12660,CHAPTER X,"by since that time, out of use and unstrung, for no man had strength"
12661,CHAPTER X,"to draw that bow, save Ulysses. So it had remained, as a monument of"
12662,CHAPTER X,"the great strength of its master. This bow, with the quiver of arrows"
12663,CHAPTER X,"belonging thereto, Telemachus had brought down from the armoury on the"
12664,CHAPTER X,"last night along with the lances; and now Minerva, intending to do"
12665,CHAPTER X,"Ulysses an honour, put it into the mind of Telemachus, to propose to"
12666,CHAPTER X,the suitors to try who was strongest to draw that bow; and he promised
12667,CHAPTER X,"that to the man who should be able to draw that bow, his mother should"
12668,CHAPTER X,be given in marriage; Ulysses's wife the prize to him who should bend
12669,CHAPTER X,the bow of Ulysses.
12670,CHAPTER X,
12671,CHAPTER X,There was great strife and emulation stirred up among the suitors at
12672,CHAPTER X,"those words of the prince Telemachus. And to grace her son's words,"
12673,CHAPTER X,"and to confirm the promise which he had made, Penelope came and"
12674,CHAPTER X,shewed herself that day to the suitors; and Minerva made her that she
12675,CHAPTER X,"appeared never so comely in their sight as that day, and they were"
12676,CHAPTER X,"inflamed with the beholding of so much beauty, proposed as the price"
12677,CHAPTER X,"of so great manhood; and they cried out, that if all those heroes who"
12678,CHAPTER X,"sailed to Colchos for the rich purchase of the golden-fleeced ram, had"
12679,CHAPTER X,"seen earth's richer prize, Penelope, they would not have made their"
12680,CHAPTER X,"voyage, but would have vowed their valours and their lives to her, for"
12681,CHAPTER X,she was at all parts faultless.
12682,CHAPTER X,
12683,CHAPTER X,"And she said, ""The gods have taken my beauty from me, since my lord"
12684,CHAPTER X,"went for Troy."" But Telemachus willed his mother to depart and not be"
12685,CHAPTER X,"present at that contest, for he said, ""It may be, some rougher strife"
12686,CHAPTER X,"shall chance of this, than may be expedient for a woman to witness."""
12687,CHAPTER X,"And she retired, she and her maids, and left the hall."
12688,CHAPTER X,
12689,CHAPTER X,"Then the bow was brought into the midst, and a mark was set up by"
12690,CHAPTER X,prince Telemachus: and lord Antinous as the chief among the suitors
12691,CHAPTER X,"had the first offer, and he took the bow and fitting an arrow to the"
12692,CHAPTER X,"string, he strove to bend it, but not with all his might and main"
12693,CHAPTER X,could he once draw together the ends of that tough bow; and when he
12694,CHAPTER X,"found how vain a thing it was to endeavour to draw Ulysses's bow,"
12695,CHAPTER X,"he desisted, blushing for shame and for mere anger. Then Eurymachus"
12696,CHAPTER X,"adventured, but with no better success; but as it had torn the hands"
12697,CHAPTER X,"of Antinous, so did the bow tear and strain his hands, and marred his"
12698,CHAPTER X,"delicate fingers, yet could he not once stir the string. Then called"
12699,CHAPTER X,"he to the attendants to bring fat and unctuous matter, which melting"
12700,CHAPTER X,"at the fire, he dipped the bow therein, thinking to supple it and make"
12701,CHAPTER X,"it more pliable, but not with all the helps of art could he succeed in"
12702,CHAPTER X,"making it to move. After him Liodes, and Amphinomus, and Polybus, and"
12703,CHAPTER X,"Eurynomus, and Polyctorides, assayed their strength, but not any one"
12704,CHAPTER X,"of them, or of the rest of those aspiring suitors, had any better"
12705,CHAPTER X,luck: yet not the meanest of them there but thought himself well
12706,CHAPTER X,"worthy of Ulysses's wife, though to shoot with Ulysses's bow the"
12707,CHAPTER X,completest champion among them was by proof found too feeble.
12708,CHAPTER X,
12709,CHAPTER X,Then Ulysses prayed them that he might have leave to try; and
12710,CHAPTER X,"immediately a clamour was raised among the suitors, because of his"
12711,CHAPTER X,"petition, and they scorned and swelled with rage at his presumption,"
12712,CHAPTER X,and that a beggar should seek to contend in a game of such noble
12713,CHAPTER X,"mastery. But Telemachus ordered that the bow should be given him, and"
12714,CHAPTER X,"that he should have leave to try, since they had failed; ""for,"" he"
12715,CHAPTER X,"said, ""the bow is mine, to give or to withhold:"" and none durst"
12716,CHAPTER X,gainsay the prince.
12717,CHAPTER X,
12718,CHAPTER X,"Then Ulysses gave a sign to his son, and he commanded the doors of the"
12719,CHAPTER X,"hall to be made fast, and all wondered at his words, but none could"
12720,CHAPTER X,"divine the cause. And Ulysses took the bow into his hands, and before"
12721,CHAPTER X,"he essayed to bend it, he surveyed it at all parts, to see whether,"
12722,CHAPTER X,"by long lying by, it had contracted any stiffness which hindered the"
12723,CHAPTER X,"drawing; and as he was busied in the curious surveying of his bow,"
12724,CHAPTER X,"some of the suitors mocked him and said, ""Past doubt this man is a"
12725,CHAPTER X,"right cunning archer, and knows his craft well. See how he turns it"
12726,CHAPTER X,"over and over, and looks into it, as if he could see through the"
12727,CHAPTER X,"wood."" And others said, ""We wish some one would tell out gold into our"
12728,CHAPTER X,"laps but for so long a time as he shall be in drawing of that string."""
12729,CHAPTER X,"But when he had spent some little time in making proof of the bow, and"
12730,CHAPTER X,"had found it to be in good plight, like as a harper in tuning of his"
12731,CHAPTER X,"harp draws out a string, with such ease or much more did Ulysses draw"
12732,CHAPTER X,"to the head the string of his own tough bow, and in letting of it go,"
12733,CHAPTER X,it twanged with such a shrill noise as a swallow makes when it sings
12734,CHAPTER X,"through the air: which so much amazed the suitors, that their colours"
12735,CHAPTER X,"came and went, and the skies gave out a noise of thunder, which at"
12736,CHAPTER X,"heart cheered Ulysses, for he knew that now his long labours by the"
12737,CHAPTER X,disposal of the fates drew to an end. Then fitted he an arrow to the
12738,CHAPTER X,"bow, and drawing it to the head, he sent it right to the mark which"
12739,CHAPTER X,"the prince had set up. Which done, he said to Telemachus, ""You have"
12740,CHAPTER X,"got no disgrace yet by your guest, for I have struck the mark I shot"
12741,CHAPTER X,"at, and gave myself no such trouble in teazing the bow with fat and"
12742,CHAPTER X,"fire, as these men did, but have made proof that my strength is not"
12743,CHAPTER X,"impaired, nor my age so weak and contemptible as these were pleased to"
12744,CHAPTER X,"think it. But come, the day going down calls us to supper, after which"
12745,CHAPTER X,"succeed poem and harp, and all delights which use to crown princely"
12746,CHAPTER X,"banquetings."""
12747,CHAPTER X,
12748,CHAPTER X,"So saying, he beckoned to his son, who straight girt his sword to his"
12749,CHAPTER X,"side, and took one of the lances (of which there lay great store from"
12750,CHAPTER X,"the armoury) in his hand, and armed at all points, advanced towards"
12751,CHAPTER X,his father.
12752,CHAPTER X,
12753,CHAPTER X,"The upper rags which Ulysses wore fell from his shoulder, and his own"
12754,CHAPTER X,"kingly likeness returned, when he rushed to the great hall door with"
12755,CHAPTER X,"bow and quiver full of shafts, which down at his feet he poured, and"
12756,CHAPTER X,"in bitter words presignified his deadly intent to the suitors. ""Thus"
12757,CHAPTER X,"far,"" he said, ""this contest has been decided harmless: now for us"
12758,CHAPTER X,"there rests another mark, harder to hit, but which my hands shall"
12759,CHAPTER X,"essay notwithstanding, if Phoebus god of archers be pleased to give"
12760,CHAPTER X,"me the mastery."" With that he let fly a deadly arrow at Antinous,"
12761,CHAPTER X,which pierced him in the throat as he was in the act of lifting a cup
12762,CHAPTER X,"of wine to his mouth. Amazement seized the suitors, as their great"
12763,CHAPTER X,"champion fell dead, and they raged highly against Ulysses, and said"
12764,CHAPTER X,"that it should prove the dearest shaft which he ever let fly, for he"
12765,CHAPTER X,"had slain a man, whose like breathed not in any part of the kingdom:"
12766,CHAPTER X,"and they flew to their arms, and would have seized the lances, but"
12767,CHAPTER X,Minerva struck them with dimness of sight that they went erring up and
12768,CHAPTER X,"down the hall, not knowing where to find them. Yet so infatuated were"
12769,CHAPTER X,"they by the displeasure of heaven, that they did not see the imminent"
12770,CHAPTER X,"peril which impended over them, but every man believed that this"
12771,CHAPTER X,accident had happened beside the intention of the doer. Fools! to
12772,CHAPTER X,"think by shutting their eyes to evade destiny, or that any other cup"
12773,CHAPTER X,"remained for them, but that which their great Antinous had tasted!"
12774,CHAPTER X,
12775,CHAPTER X,"Then Ulysses revealed himself to all in that presence, and that he"
12776,CHAPTER X,"was the man whom they held to be dead at Troy, whose palace they"
12777,CHAPTER X,"had usurped, whose wife in his life-time they had sought in impious"
12778,CHAPTER X,"marriage, and that for this reason destruction was come upon them."
12779,CHAPTER X,"And he dealt his deadly arrows among them, and there was no avoiding"
12780,CHAPTER X,"him, nor escaping from his horrid person, and Telemachus by his side"
12781,CHAPTER X,plied them thick with those murderous lances from which there was no
12782,CHAPTER X,"retreat, till fear itself made them valiant, and danger gave them eyes"
12783,CHAPTER X,"to understand the peril; then they which had swords drew them, and"
12784,CHAPTER X,"some with shields, that could find them, and some with tables and"
12785,CHAPTER X,"benches snatched up in haste, rose in a mass to overwhelm and crush"
12786,CHAPTER X,"those two; yet they singly bestirred themselves like men, and defended"
12787,CHAPTER X,"themselves against that great host, and through tables, shields and"
12788,CHAPTER X,"all, right through the arrows of Ulysses clove, and the irresistible"
12789,CHAPTER X,"lances of Telemachus; and many lay dead, and all had wounds, and"
12790,CHAPTER X,Minerva in the likeness of a bird sate upon the beam which went across
12791,CHAPTER X,"the hall, clapping her wings with a fearful noise, and sometimes the"
12792,CHAPTER X,"great bird would fly among them, cuffing at the swords and at the"
12793,CHAPTER X,"lances, and up and down the hall would go, beating her wings, and"
12794,CHAPTER X,"troubling every thing, that it was frightful to behold, and it frayed"
12795,CHAPTER X,the blood from the cheeks of those heaven-hated suitors: but to
12796,CHAPTER X,"Ulysses and his son she appeared in her own divine similitude, with"
12797,CHAPTER X,"her snake-fringed shield, a goddess armed, fighting their battles. Nor"
12798,CHAPTER X,"did that dreadful pair desist, till they had laid all their foes at"
12799,CHAPTER X,"their feet. At their feet they lay in shoals; like fishes, when the"
12800,CHAPTER X,"fishermen break up their nets, so they lay gasping and sprawling at"
12801,CHAPTER X,the feet of Ulysses and his son. And Ulysses remembered the prediction
12802,CHAPTER X,"of Tiresias, which said that he was to perish by his own guests,"
12803,CHAPTER X,unless he slew those who knew him not.
12804,CHAPTER X,
12805,CHAPTER X,Then certain of the queen's household went up and told Penelope what
12806,CHAPTER X,"had happened, and how her lord Ulysses was come home, and had slain"
12807,CHAPTER X,"the suitors. But she gave no heed to their words, but thought that"
12808,CHAPTER X,"some frenzy possessed them, or that they mocked her: for it is the"
12809,CHAPTER X,"property of such extremes of sorrow as she had felt, not to believe"
12810,CHAPTER X,when any great joy cometh. And she rated and chid them exceedingly for
12811,CHAPTER X,troubling her. But they the more persisted in their asseverations of
12812,CHAPTER X,the truth of what they had affirmed; and some of them had seen the
12813,CHAPTER X,slaughtered bodies of the suitors dragged forth of the hall. And they
12814,CHAPTER X,"said, ""That poor guest whom you talked with last night was Ulysses."""
12815,CHAPTER X,"Then she was yet more fully persuaded that they mocked her, and she"
12816,CHAPTER X,"wept. But they said, ""This thing is true which we have told. We sat"
12817,CHAPTER X,"within, in an inner room in the palace, and the doors of the hall"
12818,CHAPTER X,"were shut on us, but we heard the cries and the groans of the men"
12819,CHAPTER X,"that were killed, but saw nothing, till at length your son called to"
12820,CHAPTER X,"us to come in, and entering we saw Ulysses standing in the midst of"
12821,CHAPTER X,"the slaughtered."" But she persisting in her unbelief, said, that it"
12822,CHAPTER X,was some god which had deceived them to think it was the person of
12823,CHAPTER X,Ulysses.
12824,CHAPTER X,
12825,CHAPTER X,By this time Telemachus and his father had cleansed their hands from
12826,CHAPTER X,"the slaughter, and were come to where the queen was talking with those"
12827,CHAPTER X,"of her household; and when she saw Ulysses, she stood motionless,"
12828,CHAPTER X,"and had no power to speak, sudden surprise and joy and fear and many"
12829,CHAPTER X,passions strove within her. Sometimes she was clear that it was her
12830,CHAPTER X,"husband that she saw, and sometimes the alteration which twenty years"
12831,CHAPTER X,had made in his person (yet that was not much) perplexed her that she
12832,CHAPTER X,"knew not what to think, and for joy she could not believe, and yet for"
12833,CHAPTER X,"joy she would not but believe, and, above all, that sudden change from"
12834,CHAPTER X,"a beggar to a king troubled her, and wrought uneasy scruples in her"
12835,CHAPTER X,"mind. But Telemachus, seeing her strangeness, blamed her, and called"
12836,CHAPTER X,her an ungentle and tyrannous mother! and said that she shewed a too
12837,CHAPTER X,"great curiousness of modesty, to abstain from embracing his father,"
12838,CHAPTER X,"and to have doubts of his person, when to all present it was evident"
12839,CHAPTER X,that he was the very real and true Ulysses.
12840,CHAPTER X,
12841,CHAPTER X,"Then she mistrusted no longer, but ran and fell upon Ulysses's neck,"
12842,CHAPTER X,"and said, ""Let not my husband be angry, that I held off so long with"
12843,CHAPTER X,"strange delays; it is the gods, who severing us for so long time, have"
12844,CHAPTER X,caused this unseemly distance in me. If Menelaus's wife had used half
12845,CHAPTER X,"my caution, she would never have taken so freely to a stranger's bed;"
12846,CHAPTER X,and she might have spared us all these plagues which have come upon us
12847,CHAPTER X,"through her shameless deed."""
12848,CHAPTER X,
12849,CHAPTER X,"These words with which Penelope excused herself, wrought more"
12850,CHAPTER X,affection in Ulysses than if upon a first sight she had given up
12851,CHAPTER X,herself implicitly to his embraces; and he wept for joy to possess a
12852,CHAPTER X,"wife so discreet, so answering to his own staid mind, that had a depth"
12853,CHAPTER X,"of wit proportioned to his own, and one that held chaste virtue at"
12854,CHAPTER X,so high a price; and he thought the possession of such a one cheaply
12855,CHAPTER X,"purchased with the loss of all Circe's delights, and Calypso's"
12856,CHAPTER X,immortality of joys; and his long labours and his severe sufferings
12857,CHAPTER X,"past seemed as nothing, now they were crowned with the enjoyment of"
12858,CHAPTER X,his virtuous and true wife Penelope. And as sad men at sea whose ship
12859,CHAPTER X,"has gone to pieces nigh shore, swimming for their lives, all drenched"
12860,CHAPTER X,"in foam and brine, crawl up to some poor patch of land, which they"
12861,CHAPTER X,take possession of with as great a joy as if they had the world given
12862,CHAPTER X,"them in fee, with such delight did this chaste wife cling to her lord"
12863,CHAPTER X,"restored, till the dark night fast coming on reminded her of that more"
12864,CHAPTER X,intimate and happy union when in her long-widowed bed she should once
12865,CHAPTER X,again clasp a living Ulysses.
12866,CHAPTER X,
12867,CHAPTER X,So from that time the land had rest from the suitors. And the happy
12868,CHAPTER X,Ithacans with songs and solemn sacrifices of praise to the gods
12869,CHAPTER X,celebrated the return of Ulysses: for he that had been so long absent
12870,CHAPTER X,was returned to wreak the evil upon the heads of the doers; in the
12871,CHAPTER X,"place where they had done the evil, there wreaked he his vengeance"
12872,CHAPTER X,upon them.

12892,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12893,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12894,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"My dear young friends,"
12895,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12896,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"Though released from the business of the school, the absence of"
12897,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,your governess confines me to Amwell during the vacation. I
12898,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,cannot better employ my leisure hours than in contributing to the
12899,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"amusement of you my kind pupils, who, by your affectionate"
12900,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"attentions to my instructions, have rendered a life of labour"
12901,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,pleasant to me.
12902,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12903,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,On your return to school I hope to have a fair copy ready to
12904,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,present to each of you of your own biographical conversations last
12905,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,winter.
12906,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12907,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,Accept my thanks for the approbation you were pleased to express
12908,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,when I offered to become your _amanuensis_. I hope you will find
12909,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"I have executed the office with a tolerably faithful pen, as"
12910,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"you know I took notes each day during those conversations, and"
12911,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,arranged my materials after you were retired to rest.
12912,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12913,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,I begin from the day our school commenced. It was opened by your
12914,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"governess for the first time, on the ---- day of February. I"
12915,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,pass over your several arrivals on the morning of that day. Your
12916,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,governess received you from your friends in her own parlour.
12917,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12918,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,Every carriage that drove from the door I knew had left a sad
12919,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"heart behind.--Your eyes were red with weeping, when your"
12920,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,governess introduced me to you as the teacher she had engaged to
12921,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,instruct you. She next desired me to show you into the room which
12922,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"we now call the play-room. ""The ladies"" said she, ""may play, and"
12923,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"amuse themselves, and be as happy as they please this evening,"
12924,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,that they may be well acquainted with each other before they enter
12925,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"the school-room to-morrow morning."""
12926,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12927,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"The traces of tears were on every cheek, and I also was sad; for"
12928,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"I, like you, had parted from my friends, and the duties of my"
12929,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"profession were new to me, yet I felt that it was improper to give"
12930,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,way to my own melancholy thoughts. I knew that it was my first
12931,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,duty to divert the solitary young strangers: for I considered that
12932,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"this was very unlike the entrance to an old established school,"
12933,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,where there is always some good-natured girl who will shew
12934,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"attentions to a new scholar, and take pleasure in initiating her"
12935,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"into the customs and amusements of the place. These, thought"
12936,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"I, have their own amusements to invent; their own customs"
12937,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,to establish. How unlike too is this forlorn meeting to old
12938,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"school-fellows returning after the holidays, when mutual greetings"
12939,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,soon lighten the memory of parting sorrow!
12940,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12941,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,I invited you to draw near a bright fire which blazed in the
12942,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"chimney, and looked the only cheerful thing in the room."
12943,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12944,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"During our first solemn silence, which, you may remember, was only"
12945,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"broken by my repeated requests that you would make a smaller, and"
12946,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"still smaller circle, till I saw the fire-place fairly inclosed"
12947,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"round, the idea came into my mind, which has since been a source"
12948,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"of amusement to you in the recollection, and to myself in"
12949,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"particular has been of essential benefit, as it enabled me to form"
12950,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"a just estimate of the dispositions of you my young pupils, and"
12951,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,assisted me to adapt my plan of future instructions to each
12952,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,individual temper.
12953,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12954,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"An introduction to a point we wish to carry, we always feel to be"
12955,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"an aukward affair, and generally execute it in an aukward manner;"
12956,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"so I believe I did then: for when I imparted this idea to you, I"
12957,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"think I prefaced it rather too formally for such young auditors,"
12958,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"for I began with telling you, that I had read in old authors,"
12959,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"that it was not unfrequent in former times, when strangers were"
12960,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"assembled together, as we might be, for them to amuse themselves"
12961,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"with telling stories, either of their own lives, or the adventures"
12962,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"of others. ""Will you allow me, ladies,"" I continued, ""to persuade"
12963,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,you to amuse yourselves in this way? you will not then look so
12964,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,unsociably upon each other: for we find that these strangers of
12965,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"whom we read, were as well acquainted before the conclusion of"
12966,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"the first story, as if they had known each other many years. Let"
12967,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,me prevail upon you to relate some little anecdotes of your own
12968,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"lives. Fictitious tales we can read in books, and [they] were"
12969,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,therefore better adapted to conversation in those times when books
12970,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"of amusement were more scarce than they are at present."""
12971,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12972,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"After many objections of not knowing what to say, or how to begin,"
12973,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"which I overcame by assuring you how easy it would be, for that"
12974,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,every person is naturally eloquent when they are the hero or
12975,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"heroine of their own tale, the _Who should begin_ was next in"
12976,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,question.
12977,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12978,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"I proposed to draw lots, which formed a little amusement of"
12979,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"itself. Miss Manners, who till then had been the saddest of the"
12980,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"sad, began to brighten up, and said it was just like drawing king"
12981,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"and queen, and began to tell us where she passed last twelfth day;"
12982,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,but as her narration must have interfered with the more important
12983,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"business of the lottery, I advised her to postpone it, till it"
12984,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"came to her turn to favour us with the history of her life, when"
12985,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,it would appear in its proper order. The first number fell to the
12986,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"share of miss Villiers, whose joy at drawing what we called the_"
12987,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"first prize, _was tempered with shame at appearing as the first"
12988,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,historian in the company. She wished she had not been the very
12989,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"first:--she had passed all her life in a retired village, and"
12990,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,had nothing to relate of herself that could give the least
12991,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,entertainment:--she had not the least idea in the world where
12992,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,to begin.
12993,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
12994,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"""Begin,"" said I, ""with your name, for that at present is unknown"
12995,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,to us. Tell us the first thing you can remember; relate whatever
12996,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,happened to make a great impression on you when you were very
12997,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"young, and if you find you can connect your story till your"
12998,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"arrival here to-day, I am sure we shall listen to you with"
12999,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"pleasure; and if you like to break off, and only treat us with a"
13000,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"part of your history, we will excuse you, with many thanks for the"
13001,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,amusement which you have afforded us; and the lady who has drawn
13002,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"the second number will, I hope, take her turn with the same"
13003,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"indulgence, to relate either all, or any part of the events of"
13004,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"her life, as best pleases her own fancy, or as she finds she can"
13005,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"manage it with the most ease to herself.""--Encouraged by this"
13006,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"offer of indulgence, miss Villiers began."
13007,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
13008,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"If in my report of her story, or in any which follow, I shall"
13009,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,appear to make her or you speak an older language than it seems
13010,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"probable that you should use, speaking in your own words, it must"
13011,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"be remembered, that what is very proper and becoming when spoken,"
13012,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,requires to be arranged with some little difference before it can
13013,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"be set down in writing. Little inaccuracies must be pared away,"
13014,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,and the whole must assume a more formal and correct appearance. My
13015,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"own way of thinking, I am sensible, will too often intrude itself,"
13016,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"but I have endeavoured to preserve, as exactly as I could, your"
13017,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"own words, and your own peculiarities of style and manner, and to"
13018,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,approve myself
13019,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,
13020,THE YOUNG LADIES AT AMWELL SCHOOL,"Your faithful historiographer,"

13031,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,(_By Mary Lamb_)
13032,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13033,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13034,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"My father is the curate of a village church, about five miles"
13035,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"from Amwell. I was born in the parsonage-house, which joins the"
13036,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,church-yard. The first thing I can remember was my father teaching me
13037,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,the alphabet from the letters on a tombstone that stood at the head of
13038,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,my mother's grave. I used to tap at my father's study-door; I think I
13039,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"now hear him say, ""Who is there?--What do you want, little girl?"" ""Go"
13040,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"and see mamma. Go and learn pretty letters."" Many times in the day"
13041,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,would my father lay aside his books and his papers to lead me to this
13042,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"spot, and make me point to the letters, and then set me to spell"
13043,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"syllables and words: in this manner, the epitaph on my mother's tomb"
13044,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"being my primmer and my spelling-book, I learned to read."
13045,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13046,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"I was one day sitting on a step placed across the church-yard stile,"
13047,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"when a gentleman passing by, heard me distinctly repeat the letters"
13048,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"which formed my mother's name, and then say, _Elizabeth Villiers_,"
13049,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"with a firm tone, as if I had performed some great matter. This"
13050,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"gentleman was my uncle James, my mother's brother: he was a lieutenant"
13051,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"in the navy, and had left England a few weeks after the marriage of"
13052,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"my father and mother, and now, returned home from a long sea-voyage,"
13053,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,he was coming to visit my mother; no tidings of her decease having
13054,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"reached him, though she had been dead more than a twelvemonth."
13055,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13056,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"When my uncle saw me sitting on the stile, and heard me pronounce my"
13057,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"mother's name, he looked earnestly in my face, and began to fancy a"
13058,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"resemblance to his sister, and to think I might be her child. I was"
13059,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"too intent on my employment to observe him, and went spelling on. ""Who"
13060,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"has taught you to spell so prettily, my little maid?"" said my uncle."
13061,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"""Mamma,"" I replied; for I had an idea that the words on the tombstone"
13062,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"were somehow a part of mamma, and that she had taught me. ""And who is"
13063,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"mamma?"" asked my uncle. ""Elizabeth Villiers,"" I replied; and then my"
13064,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"uncle called me his dear little niece, and said he would go with me to"
13065,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"mamma: he took hold of my hand, intending to lead me home, delighted"
13066,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"that he had found out who I was, because he imagined it would be such"
13067,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,a pleasant surprise to his sister to see her little daughter bringing
13068,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,home her long lost sailor uncle.
13069,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13070,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"I agreed to take him to mamma, but we had a dispute about the way"
13071,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,thither. My uncle was for going along the road which led directly up
13072,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"to our house; I pointed to the church-yard, and said, that was the way"
13073,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"to mamma. Though impatient of any delay, he was not willing to contest"
13074,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"the point with his new relation, therefore he lifted me over the"
13075,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"stile, and was then going to take me along the path to a gate he knew"
13076,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"was at the end of our garden; but no, I would not go that way neither:"
13077,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"letting go his hand, I said, ""You do not know the way--I will shew"
13078,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"you:"" and making what haste I could among the long grass and thistles,"
13079,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"and jumping over the low graves, he said, as he followed what he"
13080,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"called my _wayward steps_, ""What a positive soul this little niece of"
13081,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"mine is! I knew the way to your mother's house before you were born,"
13082,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"child."" At last I stopped at my mother's grave, and, pointing to the"
13083,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"tombstone, said, ""Here is mamma,"" in a voice of exultation, as if I"
13084,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,had now convinced him that I knew the way best: I looked up in his
13085,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"face to see him acknowledge his mistake; but Oh, what a face of"
13086,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"sorrow did I see! I was so frightened, that I have but an imperfect"
13087,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"recollection of what followed. I remember I pulled his coat, and cried"
13088,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"""Sir, sir,"" and tried to move him. I knew not what to do; my mind"
13089,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,was in a strange confusion; I thought I had done something wrong in
13090,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,bringing the gentleman to mamma to make him cry so sadly; but what it
13091,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,was I could not tell. This grave had always been a scene of delight
13092,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"to me. In the house my father would often be weary of my prattle, and"
13093,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,send me from him; but here he was all my own. I might say anything
13094,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,and be as frolicsome as I pleased here; all was chearfulness and good
13095,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"humour in our visits to mamma, as we called it. My father would tell"
13096,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"me how quietly mamma slept there, and that he and his little Betsy"
13097,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,would one day sleep beside mamma in that grave; and when I went to
13098,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"bed, as I laid my little head on the pillow, I used to wish I was"
13099,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,sleeping in the grave with my papa and mamma; and in my childish
13100,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"dreams I used to fancy myself there, and it was a place within the"
13101,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"ground, all smooth, and soft, and green. I never made out any figure"
13102,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"of mamma, but still it was the tombstone, and papa, and the smooth"
13103,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"green grass, and my head resting upon the elbow of my father."
13104,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13105,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,How long my uncle remained in this agony of grief I know not; to me
13106,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"it seemed a very long time: at last he took me in his arms, and held"
13107,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"me so tight, that I began to cry, and ran home to my father, and told"
13108,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"him, that a gentleman was crying about mamma's pretty letters."
13109,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13110,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,No doubt it was a very affecting meeting between my father and my
13111,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,uncle. I remember that it was the first day I ever saw my father weep:
13112,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"that I was in sad trouble, and went into the kitchen and told Susan,"
13113,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"our servant, that papa was crying; and she wanted to keep me with her"
13114,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,that I might not disturb the conversation; but I would go back to the
13115,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"parlour to _poor papa_, and I went in softly, and crept between my"
13116,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"father's knees. My uncle offered to take me in his arms, but I turned"
13117,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"sullenly from him, and clung closer to my father, having conceived a"
13118,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,dislike to my uncle because he had made my father cry.
13119,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13120,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,Now I first learned that my mother's death was a heavy affliction; for
13121,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"I heard my father tell a melancholy story of her long illness, her"
13122,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"death, and what he had suffered from her loss. My uncle said, what a"
13123,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,sad thing it was for my father to be left with such a young child; but
13124,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"my father replied, his little Betsy was all his comfort, and that, but"
13125,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"for me, he should have died with grief. How I could be any comfort to"
13126,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"my father, struck me with wonder. I knew I was pleased when he played"
13127,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,and talked with me; but I thought that was all goodness and favour
13128,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"done to me, and I had no notion how I could make any part of his"
13129,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"happiness. The sorrow I now heard he had suffered, was as new and"
13130,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,strange to me. I had no idea that he had ever been unhappy; his voice
13131,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"was always kind and cheerful; I had never before seen him weep, or"
13132,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,shew any such signs of grief as those in which I used to express my
13133,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,little troubles. My thoughts on these subjects were confused and
13134,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,childish; but from that time I never ceased pondering on the sad story
13135,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,of my dead mamma.
13136,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13137,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"The next day I went by mere habit to the study door, to call papa to"
13138,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"the beloved grave; my mind misgave me, and I could not tap at the"
13139,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"door. I went backwards and forwards between the kitchen and the study,"
13140,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,and what to do with myself I did not know. My uncle met me in the
13141,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"passage, and said, ""Betsy, will you come and walk with me in the"
13142,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"garden?"" This I refused, for this was not what I wanted, but the old"
13143,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"amusement of sitting on the grave, and talking to papa. My uncle tried"
13144,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"to persuade me, but still I said, ""No, no,"" and ran crying into the"
13145,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"kitchen. As he followed me in there, Susan said, ""This child is so"
13146,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"fretful to-day, I do not know what to do with her."" ""Aye,"" said my"
13147,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"uncle, ""I suppose my poor brother spoils her, having but one."" This"
13148,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"reflection on my papa made me quite in a little passion of anger, for"
13149,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,I had not forgot that with this new uncle sorrow had first come into
13150,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"our dwelling: I screamed loudly, till my father came out to know what"
13151,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"it was all about. He sent my uncle into the parlour, and said, he"
13152,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,would manage the little wrangler by himself. When my uncle was gone I
13153,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"ceased crying; my father forgot to lecture me for my ill humour, or"
13154,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"to enquire into the cause, and we were soon seated by the side of the"
13155,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,tombstone. No lesson went on that day; no talking of pretty mamma
13156,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,sleeping in the green grave; no jumping from the tombstone to the
13157,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,ground; no merry jokes or pleasant stories. I sate upon my father's
13158,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"knee, looking up in his face, and thinking, ""_How sorry papa looks_,"""
13159,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"till, having been fatigued with crying, and now oppressed with"
13160,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"thought, I fell fast asleep."
13161,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13162,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,My uncle soon learned from Susan that this place was our constant
13163,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,haunt; she told him she did verily believe her master would never get
13164,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"the better of the death of her mistress, while he continued to teach"
13165,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"the child to read at the tombstone; for, though it might sooth his"
13166,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"grief, it kept it for ever fresh in his memory. The sight of his"
13167,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"sister's grave had been such a shock to my uncle, that he readily"
13168,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"entered into Susan's apprehensions; and concluding, that if I were set"
13169,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,to study by some other means there would no longer be a pretence for
13170,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"these visits to the grave, away my kind uncle hastened to the nearest"
13171,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,market-town to buy me some books.
13172,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13173,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"I heard the conference between my uncle and Susan, and I did not"
13174,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,approve of his interfering in our pleasures. I saw him take his hat
13175,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"and walk out, and I secretly hoped he was gone _beyond seas_ again,"
13176,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,from whence Susan had told me he had come. Where _beyond seas_ was I
13177,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,could not tell; but I concluded it was somewhere a great way off. I
13178,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"took my seat on the church-yard stile, and kept looking down the road,"
13179,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"and saying, ""I hope I shall not see my uncle again. I hope my uncle"
13180,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"will not come from _beyond seas_ any more;"" but I said this very"
13181,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"softly, and had a kind of notion that I was in a perverse ill-humoured"
13182,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,fit. Here I sate till my uncle returned from the market-town with his
13183,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,new purchases. I saw him come walking very fast with a parcel under
13184,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"his arm. I was very sorry to see him, and I frowned, and tried to look"
13185,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"very cross. He untied his parcel, and said, ""Betsy, I have brought"
13186,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"you a pretty book."" I turned my head away, and said, ""I don't want a"
13187,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"book;"" but I could not help peeping again to look at it. In the hurry"
13188,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"of opening the parcel he had scattered all the books upon the ground,"
13189,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,and there I saw fine gilt covers and gay pictures all fluttering
13190,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"about. What a fine sight!--All my resentment vanished, and I held up"
13191,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"my face to kiss him, that being my way of thanking my father for any"
13192,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,extraordinary favour.
13193,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13194,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,My uncle had brought himself into rather a troublesome office; he had
13195,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"heard me spell so well, that he thought there was nothing to do but"
13196,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"to put books into my hand, and I should read; yet, notwithstanding"
13197,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"I spelt tolerably well, the letters in my new library were so much"
13198,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"smaller than I had been accustomed to, they were like Greek characters"
13199,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,to me; I could make nothing at all of them. The honest sailor was
13200,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,not to be discouraged by this difficulty; though unused to play the
13201,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"schoolmaster, he taught me to read the small print, with unwearied"
13202,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,diligence and patience; and whenever he saw my father and me look as
13203,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"if we wanted to resume our visits to the grave, he would propose some"
13204,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,pleasant walk; and if my father said it was too far for the child to
13205,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"walk, he would set me on his shoulder, and say, ""Then Betsy shall"
13206,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"ride;"" and in this manner has he carried me many many miles."
13207,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13208,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,In these pleasant excursions my uncle seldom forgot to make Susan
13209,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"furnish him with a luncheon which, though it generally happened every"
13210,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"day, made a constant surprise to my papa and me, when, seated under"
13211,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"some shady tree, he pulled it out of his pocket, and began to"
13212,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,distribute his little store; and then I used to peep into the other
13213,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,pocket to see if there were not some currant wine there and the little
13214,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"bottle of water for me; if, perchance, the water was forgot, then it"
13215,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"made another joke,--that poor Betsy must be forced to drink a little"
13216,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"drop of wine. These are childish things to tell of, and instead of my"
13217,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"own silly history, I wish I could remember the entertaining stories my"
13218,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"uncle used to relate of his voyages and travels, while we sate under"
13219,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"the shady trees, eating our noon-tide meal."
13220,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13221,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,The long visit my uncle made us was such an important event in my
13222,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"life, that I fear I shall tire your patience with talking of him; but"
13223,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"when he is gone, the remainder of my story will be but short."
13224,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13225,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"The summer months passed away, but not swiftly;--the pleasant walks,"
13226,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"and the charming stories of my uncle's adventures, made them seem like"
13227,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,years to me; I remember the approach of winter by the warm great coat
13228,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"he bought for me, and how proud I was when I first put it on, and that"
13229,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"he called me Little Red Riding Hood, and bade me beware of wolves, and"
13230,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,that I laughed and said there were no such things now; then he told me
13231,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"how many wolves, and bears, and tygers, and lions he had met with in"
13232,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"uninhabited lands, that were like Robinson Crusoe's Island. O these"
13233,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,were happy days!
13234,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13235,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,In the winter our walks were shorter and less frequent. My books were
13236,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"now my chief amusement, though my studies were often interrupted by"
13237,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"a game of romps with my uncle, which too often ended in a quarrel"
13238,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,because he played so roughly; yet long before this I dearly loved
13239,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"my uncle, and the improvement I made while he was with us was very"
13240,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"great indeed. I could now read very well, and the continual habit of"
13241,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,listening to the conversation of my father and my uncle made me a
13242,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"little woman in understanding; so that my father said to him, ""James,"
13243,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"you have made my child quite a companionable little being."""
13244,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13245,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,My father often left me alone with my uncle; sometimes to write his
13246,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"sermons; sometimes to visit the sick, or give counsel to his poor"
13247,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"neighbours: then my uncle used to hold long conversations with me,"
13248,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"telling me how I should strive to make my father happy, and endeavour"
13249,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,to improve myself when he was gone:--now I began justly to understand
13250,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,why he had taken such pains to keep my father from visiting my
13251,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"mother's grave, that grave which I often stole privately to look at;"
13252,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"but now never without awe and reverence, for my uncle used to tell"
13253,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"me what an excellent lady my mother was, and I now thought of her as"
13254,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"having been a real mamma, which before seemed an ideal something,"
13255,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,no way connected with life. And he told me that the ladies from the
13256,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"Manor-House, who sate in the best pew in the church, were not so"
13257,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"graceful, and the best women in the village were not so good, as was"
13258,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"my sweet mamma; and that if she had lived, I should not have been"
13259,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"forced to pick up a little knowledge from him, a rough sailor, or to"
13260,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"learn to knit and sew of Susan, but that she would have taught me all"
13261,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"lady-like fine works and delicate behaviour and perfect manners, and"
13262,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"would have selected for me proper books, such as were most fit to"
13263,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"instruct my mind, and of which he nothing knew. If ever in my life I"
13264,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,shall have any proper sense of what is excellent or becoming in the
13265,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"womanly character, I owe it to these lessons of my rough unpolished"
13266,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"uncle; for, in telling me what my mother would have made me, he taught"
13267,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"me what to wish to be; and when, soon after my uncle left us, I was"
13268,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"introduced to the ladies at the Manor-House, instead of hanging down"
13269,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"my head with shame, as I should have done before my uncle came, like a"
13270,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"little village rustic, I tried to speak distinctly, with ease, and a"
13271,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"modest gentleness, as my uncle had said my mother used to do; instead"
13272,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"of hanging down my head abashed, I looked upon them, and thought what"
13273,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"a pretty sight a fine lady was, and thought how well my mother must"
13274,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"have appeared, since she was so much more graceful than these ladies"
13275,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,were; and when I heard them compliment my father on the admirable
13276,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"behaviour of his child, and say how well he had brought me up, I"
13277,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"thought to myself, ""Papa does not much mind my manners, if I am"
13278,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,but a good girl; but it was my uncle that taught me to behave like
13279,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"mamma.""--I cannot now think my uncle was so rough and unpolished as"
13280,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"he said he was, for his lessons were so good and so impressive that I"
13281,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"shall never forget them, and I hope they will be of use to me as long"
13282,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,as I live: he would explain to me the meaning of all the words he
13283,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"used, such as grace and elegance, modest diffidence and affectation,"
13284,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"pointing out instances of what he meant by those words, in the manners"
13285,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"of the ladies and their young daughters who came to our church; for,"
13286,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"besides the ladies of the Manor-House, many of the neighbouring"
13287,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,families came to our church because my father preached so well.
13288,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13289,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"It must have been early in the spring when my uncle went away, for the"
13290,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"crocuses were just blown in the garden, and the primroses had begun to"
13291,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,peep from under the young budding hedge-rows.--I cried as if my heart
13292,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"would break, when I had the last sight of him through a little opening"
13293,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"among the trees, as he went down the road. My father accompanied him"
13294,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"to the market-town, from whence he was to proceed in the stage-coach"
13295,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,to London. How tedious I thought all Susan's endeavours to comfort me
13296,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"were. The stile where I first saw my uncle, came into my mind, and I"
13297,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"thought I would go and sit there, and think about that day; but I was"
13298,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"no sooner seated there, than I remembered how I had frightened him"
13299,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"by taking him so foolishly to my mother's grave, and then again how"
13300,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"naughty I had been when I sate muttering to myself at this same stile,"
13301,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"wishing that he, who had gone so far to buy me books, might never come"
13302,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"back any more: all my little quarrels with my uncle came into my mind,"
13303,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"now that I could never play with him again, and it almost broke"
13304,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,my heart. I was forced to run into the house to Susan for that
13305,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,consolation I had just before despised.
13306,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13307,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"Some days after this, as I was sitting by the fire with my father,"
13308,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"after it was dark, and before the candles were lighted, I gave him"
13309,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"an account of my troubled conscience at the church-stile, when I"
13310,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"remembered how unkind I had been to my uncle when he first came, and"
13311,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,how sorry I still was whenever I thought of the many quarrels I had
13312,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,had with him.
13313,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13314,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"My father smiled, and took hold of my hand, saying, ""I will tell you"
13315,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"all about this, my little penitent. This is the sort of way in which"
13316,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"we all feel, when those we love are taken from us.--When our dear"
13317,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"friends are with us, we go on enjoying their society, without much"
13318,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"thought or consideration of the blessing we are possessed of, nor do"
13319,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,we too nicely weigh the measure of our daily actions;--we let them
13320,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"freely share our kind or our discontented moods; and, if any little"
13321,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"bickerings disturb our friendship, it does but the more endear us to"
13322,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,each other when we are in a happier temper. But these things come over
13323,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,us like grievous faults when the object of our affection is gone for
13324,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,ever. Your dear mamma and I had no quarrels; yet in the first days of
13325,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"my lonely sorrow, how many things came into my mind that I might have"
13326,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"done to have made her happier. It is so with you, my child. You did"
13327,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"all a child could do to please your uncle, and dearly did he love"
13328,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"you; and these little things which now disturb your tender mind, were"
13329,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,remembered with delight by your uncle; he was telling me in our last
13330,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"walk, just perhaps as you were thinking about it with sorrow, of the"
13331,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,difficulty he had in getting into your good graces when he first came;
13332,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,he will think of these things with pleasure when he is far away. Put
13333,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,away from you this unfounded grief; only let it be a lesson to you to
13334,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"be as kind as possible to those you love; and remember, when they are"
13335,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"gone from you, you will never think you had been kind enough. Such"
13336,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,feelings as you have now described are the lot of humanity. So you
13337,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"will feel when I am no more, and so will your children feel when you"
13338,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"are dead. But your uncle will come back again, Betsy, and we will now"
13339,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"think of where we are to get the cage to keep the talking parrot in,"
13340,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"he is to bring home; and go and tell Susan to bring the candles, and"
13341,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"ask her if the nice cake is almost baked, that she promised to give us"
13342,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"for our tea."""
13343,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,
13344,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"At this point, my dear miss Villiers, you thought fit to break off"
13345,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"your story, and the wet eyes of your young auditors, seemed to"
13346,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,confess that you had succeeded in moving their feelings with your
13347,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,pretty narrative. It now fell by lot to the turn of miss Manners
13348,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"to relate her story, and we were all sufficiently curious to know"
13349,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,what so very young an historian had to tell of herself.--I shall
13350,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,continue the narratives for the future in the order in which
13351,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"they followed, without mentioning any of the interruptions which"
13352,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"occurred from the asking of questions, or from any other cause,"
13353,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,unless materially connected with the stories. I shall also leave
13354,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,out the apologies with which you severally thought fit to preface
13355,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"your stories of yourselves, though they were very seasonable in"
13356,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,"their place, and proceeded from a proper diffidence, because I"
13357,ELIZABETH VILLIERS,must not swell my work to too large a size.

13365,LOUISA MANNERS,
13366,LOUISA MANNERS,(_By Mary Lamb_)
13367,LOUISA MANNERS,
13368,LOUISA MANNERS,
13369,LOUISA MANNERS,"My name is Louisa Manners; I was seven years of age last birthday,"
13370,LOUISA MANNERS,which was on the first of May. I remember only four birthdays. The day
13371,LOUISA MANNERS,I was four years old is the first that I recollect. On the morning
13372,LOUISA MANNERS,"of that day, as soon as I awoke, I crept into mamma's bed, and said,"
13373,LOUISA MANNERS,"""Open your eyes, mamma, for it is my birthday. Open your eyes, and"
13374,LOUISA MANNERS,"look at me!"" Then mamma told me I should ride in a post chaise,"
13375,LOUISA MANNERS,and see my grandmamma and my sister Sarah. Grandmamma lived at a
13376,LOUISA MANNERS,"farm-house in the country, and I had never in all my life been out of"
13377,LOUISA MANNERS,"London; no, nor had I ever seen a bit of green grass, except in the"
13378,LOUISA MANNERS,"Drapers' garden, which is near my papa's house in Broad-street; nor"
13379,LOUISA MANNERS,had I ever rode in a carriage before that happy birthday.
13380,LOUISA MANNERS,
13381,LOUISA MANNERS,"I ran about the house talking of where I was going, and rejoicing so"
13382,LOUISA MANNERS,"that it was my birthday, that when I got into the chaise I was tired"
13383,LOUISA MANNERS,and fell asleep.
13384,LOUISA MANNERS,
13385,LOUISA MANNERS,"When I awoke, I saw the green fields on both sides of the chaise, and"
13386,LOUISA MANNERS,"the fields were full, quite full, of bright shining yellow flowers,"
13387,LOUISA MANNERS,"and sheep and young lambs were feeding in them. I jumped, and clapped"
13388,LOUISA MANNERS,"my hands together for joy, and I cried out This is"
13389,LOUISA MANNERS,
13390,LOUISA MANNERS,"""Abroad in the meadows to see the young lambs,"""
13391,LOUISA MANNERS,
13392,LOUISA MANNERS,for I knew many of Watts's hymns by heart.
13393,LOUISA MANNERS,
13394,LOUISA MANNERS,"The trees and hedges seemed to fly swiftly by us, and one field, and"
13395,LOUISA MANNERS,"the sheep, and the young lambs, passed away; and then another field"
13396,LOUISA MANNERS,"came, and that was full of cows; and then another field, and all the"
13397,LOUISA MANNERS,"pretty sheep returned, and there was no end of these charming sights"
13398,LOUISA MANNERS,"till we came quite to grandmamma's house, which stood all alone by"
13399,LOUISA MANNERS,"itself, no house to be seen at all near it."
13400,LOUISA MANNERS,
13401,LOUISA MANNERS,"Grandmamma was very glad to see me, and she was very sorry that I did"
13402,LOUISA MANNERS,"not remember her, though I had been so fond of her when she was in"
13403,LOUISA MANNERS,town but a few months before. I was quite ashamed of my bad memory.
13404,LOUISA MANNERS,My sister Sarah shewed me all the beautiful places about grandmamma's
13405,LOUISA MANNERS,"house. She first took me into the farm-yard, and I peeped into the"
13406,LOUISA MANNERS,"barn; there I saw a man thrashing, and as he beat the corn with his"
13407,LOUISA MANNERS,"flail, he made such a dreadful noise that I was frightened and ran"
13408,LOUISA MANNERS,away: my sister persuaded me to return; she said Will Tasker was very
13409,LOUISA MANNERS,"good-natured: then I went back, and peeped at him again; but as I"
13410,LOUISA MANNERS,"could not reconcile myself to the sound of his flail, or the sight of"
13411,LOUISA MANNERS,"his black beard, we proceeded to see the rest of the farm-yard."
13412,LOUISA MANNERS,
13413,LOUISA MANNERS,There was no end to the curiosities that Sarah had to shew me. There
13414,LOUISA MANNERS,"was the pond where the ducks were swimming, and the little wooden"
13415,LOUISA MANNERS,houses where the hens slept at night. The hens were feeding all over
13416,LOUISA MANNERS,"the yard, and the prettiest little chickens, they were feeding too,"
13417,LOUISA MANNERS,and little yellow ducklings that had a hen for their mamma. She was so
13418,LOUISA MANNERS,frightened if they went near the water. Grandmamma says a hen is not
13419,LOUISA MANNERS,esteemed a very wise bird.
13420,LOUISA MANNERS,
13421,LOUISA MANNERS,We went out of the farm-yard into the orchard. O what a sweet place
13422,LOUISA MANNERS,"grandmamma's orchard is! There were pear-trees, and apple-trees,"
13423,LOUISA MANNERS,"and cherry-trees, all in blossom. These blossoms were the prettiest"
13424,LOUISA MANNERS,"flowers that ever were seen, and among the grass under the trees there"
13425,LOUISA MANNERS,"grew butter-cups, and cowslips, and daffodils, and blue-bells. Sarah"
13426,LOUISA MANNERS,"told me all their names, and she said I might pick as many of them as"
13427,LOUISA MANNERS,ever I pleased.
13428,LOUISA MANNERS,
13429,LOUISA MANNERS,"I filled my lap with flowers, I filled my bosom with flowers, and I"
13430,LOUISA MANNERS,carried as many flowers as I could in both my hands; but as I was
13431,LOUISA MANNERS,"going into the parlour to shew them to my mamma, I stumbled over a"
13432,LOUISA MANNERS,"threshold which was placed across the parlour, and down I fell with"
13433,LOUISA MANNERS,all my treasure.
13434,LOUISA MANNERS,
13435,LOUISA MANNERS,Nothing could have so well pacified me for the misfortune of my fallen
13436,LOUISA MANNERS,"flowers, as the sight of a delicious syllabub which happened at that"
13437,LOUISA MANNERS,moment to be brought in. Grandmamma said it was a present from the
13438,LOUISA MANNERS,red cow to me because it was my birthday; and then because it was the
13439,LOUISA MANNERS,"first of May, she ordered the syllabub to be placed under the May-bush"
13440,LOUISA MANNERS,"that grew before the parlour door, and when we were seated on the"
13441,LOUISA MANNERS,"grass round it, she helped me the very first to a large glass full of"
13442,LOUISA MANNERS,"the syllabub, and wished me many happy returns of that day, and then"
13443,LOUISA MANNERS,she said I was myself the sweetest little May-blossom in the orchard.
13444,LOUISA MANNERS,
13445,LOUISA MANNERS,"After the syllabub there was the garden to see, and a most beautiful"
13446,LOUISA MANNERS,"garden it was;--long and narrow, a straight gravel walk down the"
13447,LOUISA MANNERS,"middle of it, at the end of the gravel walk there was a green arbour"
13448,LOUISA MANNERS,with a bench under it.
13449,LOUISA MANNERS,
13450,LOUISA MANNERS,"There were rows of cabbages and radishes, and peas and beans. I was"
13451,LOUISA MANNERS,"delighted to see them, for I never saw so much as a cabbage growing"
13452,LOUISA MANNERS,out of the ground before.
13453,LOUISA MANNERS,
13454,LOUISA MANNERS,"On one side of this charming garden there were a great many bee-hives,"
13455,LOUISA MANNERS,and the bees sung so prettily.
13456,LOUISA MANNERS,
13457,LOUISA MANNERS,"Mamma said, ""Have you nothing to say to these pretty bees, Louisa?"""
13458,LOUISA MANNERS,"Then I said to them,"
13459,LOUISA MANNERS,
13460,LOUISA MANNERS,"""How doth the little busy bee improve each shining hour,"
13461,LOUISA MANNERS,"And gather honey all the day from every opening flower."""
13462,LOUISA MANNERS,
13463,LOUISA MANNERS,"They had a most beautiful flower-bed to gather it from, quite close"
13464,LOUISA MANNERS,under the hives.
13465,LOUISA MANNERS,
13466,LOUISA MANNERS,"I was going to catch one bee, till Sarah told me about their stings,"
13467,LOUISA MANNERS,which made me afraid for a long time to go too near their hives; but
13468,LOUISA MANNERS,"I went a little nearer, and a little nearer, every day, and, before I"
13469,LOUISA MANNERS,"came away from grandmamma's, I grew so bold, I let Will Tasker hold me"
13470,LOUISA MANNERS,"over the glass windows at the top of the hives, to see them make honey"
13471,LOUISA MANNERS,in their own homes.
13472,LOUISA MANNERS,
13473,LOUISA MANNERS,"After seeing the garden, I saw the cows milked, and that was the last"
13474,LOUISA MANNERS,"sight I saw that day; for while I was telling mamma about the cows, I"
13475,LOUISA MANNERS,"fell fast asleep, and I suppose I was then put to bed."
13476,LOUISA MANNERS,
13477,LOUISA MANNERS,"The next morning my papa and mamma were gone. I cried sadly, but was a"
13478,LOUISA MANNERS,"little comforted at hearing they would return in a month or two, and"
13479,LOUISA MANNERS,"fetch me home. I was a foolish little thing then, and did not know"
13480,LOUISA MANNERS,how long a month was. Grandmamma gave me a little basket to gather my
13481,LOUISA MANNERS,"flowers in. I went into the orchard, and before I had half filled my"
13482,LOUISA MANNERS,"basket, I forgot all my troubles."
13483,LOUISA MANNERS,
13484,LOUISA MANNERS,The time I passed at my grandmamma's is always in my mind. Sometimes
13485,LOUISA MANNERS,"I think of the good-natured pied cow, that would let me stroke her,"
13486,LOUISA MANNERS,while the dairy-maid was milking her. Then I fancy myself running
13487,LOUISA MANNERS,"after the dairy-maid into the nice clean dairy, and see the pans full"
13488,LOUISA MANNERS,of milk and cream. Then I remember the wood-house; it had once been a
13489,LOUISA MANNERS,"large barn, but being grown old, the wood was kept there. My sister"
13490,LOUISA MANNERS,and I used to peep about among the faggots to find the eggs the hens
13491,LOUISA MANNERS,sometimes left there. Birds' nests we might not look for. Grandmamma
13492,LOUISA MANNERS,"was very angry once, when Will Tasker brought home a bird's nest, full"
13493,LOUISA MANNERS,"of pretty speckled eggs, for me. She sent him back to the hedge with"
13494,LOUISA MANNERS,"it again. She said, the little birds would not sing any more, if their"
13495,LOUISA MANNERS,eggs were taken away from them.
13496,LOUISA MANNERS,
13497,LOUISA MANNERS,"A hen, she said, was a hospitable bird, and always laid more eggs"
13498,LOUISA MANNERS,"than she wanted, on purpose to give her mistress to make puddings and"
13499,LOUISA MANNERS,custards with.
13500,LOUISA MANNERS,
13501,LOUISA MANNERS,"I do not know which pleased grandmamma best, when we carried her home"
13502,LOUISA MANNERS,"a lap-full of eggs, or a few violets; for she was particularly fond of"
13503,LOUISA MANNERS,violets.
13504,LOUISA MANNERS,
13505,LOUISA MANNERS,Violets were very scarce; we used to search very carefully for them
13506,LOUISA MANNERS,"every morning, round by the orchard hedge, and Sarah used to carry a"
13507,LOUISA MANNERS,stick in her hand to beat away the nettles; for very frequently the
13508,LOUISA MANNERS,hens left their eggs among the nettles. If we could find eggs and
13509,LOUISA MANNERS,"violets too, what happy children we were!"
13510,LOUISA MANNERS,
13511,LOUISA MANNERS,"Every day I used to fill my basket with flowers, and for a long time"
13512,LOUISA MANNERS,"I liked one pretty flower as well as another pretty flower, but Sarah"
13513,LOUISA MANNERS,"was much wiser than me, and she taught me which to prefer."
13514,LOUISA MANNERS,
13515,LOUISA MANNERS,"Grandmamma's violets were certainly best of all, but they never went"
13516,LOUISA MANNERS,"in the basket, being carried home, almost flower by flower, as soon as"
13517,LOUISA MANNERS,"they were found; therefore blue-bells might be said to be the best,"
13518,LOUISA MANNERS,"for the cowslips were all withered and gone, before I learned the true"
13519,LOUISA MANNERS,value of flowers. The best blue-bells were those tinged with red; some
13520,LOUISA MANNERS,"were so very red, that we called them red blue-bells, and these Sarah"
13521,LOUISA MANNERS,"prized very highly indeed. Daffodils were so very plentiful, they"
13522,LOUISA MANNERS,"were not thought worth gathering, unless they were double ones, and"
13523,LOUISA MANNERS,"butter-cups I found were very poor flowers indeed, yet I would pick"
13524,LOUISA MANNERS,"one now and then, because I knew they were the very same flowers that"
13525,LOUISA MANNERS,had delighted me so in the journey; for my papa had told me they were.
13526,LOUISA MANNERS,
13527,LOUISA MANNERS,"I was very careful to love best the flowers which Sarah praised most,"
13528,LOUISA MANNERS,"yet sometimes, I confess, I have even picked a daisy, though I knew it"
13529,LOUISA MANNERS,"was the very worst flower of all, because it reminded me of London,"
13530,LOUISA MANNERS,"and the Drapers' garden; for, happy as I was at grandmamma's, I could"
13531,LOUISA MANNERS,"not help sometimes thinking of my papa and mamma, and then I used to"
13532,LOUISA MANNERS,tell my sister all about London; how the houses stood all close to
13533,LOUISA MANNERS,each other; what a pretty noise the coaches made; and what a many
13534,LOUISA MANNERS,people there were in the streets. After we had been talking on these
13535,LOUISA MANNERS,"subjects, we generally used to go into the old wood-house, and play at"
13536,LOUISA MANNERS,being in London. We used to set up bits of wood for houses; our two
13537,LOUISA MANNERS,dolls we called papa and mamma; in one corner we made a little garden
13538,LOUISA MANNERS,"with grass and daisies, and that was to be the Drapers' garden. I"
13539,LOUISA MANNERS,"would not have any other flowers here than daisies, because no other"
13540,LOUISA MANNERS,grew among the grass in the real Drapers' garden. Before the time of
13541,LOUISA MANNERS,"hay-making came, it was very much talked of. Sarah told me what a"
13542,LOUISA MANNERS,"merry time it would be, for she remembered every thing which had"
13543,LOUISA MANNERS,happened for a year or more. She told me how nicely we should throw
13544,LOUISA MANNERS,the hay about. I was very desirous indeed to see the hay made.
13545,LOUISA MANNERS,
13546,LOUISA MANNERS,To be sure nothing could be more pleasant than the day the orchard was
13547,LOUISA MANNERS,"mowed: the hay smelled so sweet, and we might toss it about as much as"
13548,LOUISA MANNERS,"ever we pleased; but, dear me, we often wish for things that do not"
13549,LOUISA MANNERS,"prove so happy as we expected; the hay, which was at first so green,"
13550,LOUISA MANNERS,"and smelled so sweet, became yellow and dry, and was carried away in a"
13551,LOUISA MANNERS,"cart to feed the horses; and then, when it was all gone, and there was"
13552,LOUISA MANNERS,"no more to play with, I looked upon the naked ground, and perceived"
13553,LOUISA MANNERS,"what we had lost in these few merry days. Ladies, would you believe"
13554,LOUISA MANNERS,"it, every flower, blue-bells, daffodils, butter-cups, daisies, all"
13555,LOUISA MANNERS,were cut off by the cruel scythe of the mower. No flower was to be
13556,LOUISA MANNERS,"seen at all, except here and there a short solitary daisy, that a week"
13557,LOUISA MANNERS,before one would not have looked at.
13558,LOUISA MANNERS,
13559,LOUISA MANNERS,"It was a grief, indeed, to me, to lose all my pretty flowers; yet,"
13560,LOUISA MANNERS,"when we are in great distress, there is always, I think, something"
13561,LOUISA MANNERS,"which happens to comfort us, and so it happened now, that gooseberries"
13562,LOUISA MANNERS,"and currants were almost ripe, which was certainly a very pleasant"
13563,LOUISA MANNERS,"prospect. Some of them began to turn red, and, as we never disobeyed"
13564,LOUISA MANNERS,"grandmamma, we used often to consult together, if it was likely she"
13565,LOUISA MANNERS,"would permit us to eat them yet, then we would pick a few that looked"
13566,LOUISA MANNERS,"the ripest, and run to ask her if she thought they were ripe enough to"
13567,LOUISA MANNERS,"eat, and the uncertainty what her opinion would be, made them doubly"
13568,LOUISA MANNERS,sweet if she gave us leave to eat them.
13569,LOUISA MANNERS,
13570,LOUISA MANNERS,"When the currants and gooseberries were quite ripe, grandmamma had a"
13571,LOUISA MANNERS,sheep-shearing.
13572,LOUISA MANNERS,
13573,LOUISA MANNERS,All the sheep stood under the trees to be sheared. They were
13574,LOUISA MANNERS,"brought out of the field by old Spot, the shepherd. I stood at the"
13575,LOUISA MANNERS,"orchard-gate, and saw him drive them all in. When they had cropped off"
13576,LOUISA MANNERS,"all their wool, they looked very clean, and white, and pretty; but,"
13577,LOUISA MANNERS,"poor things, they ran shivering about with cold, so that it was a"
13578,LOUISA MANNERS,pity to see them. Great preparations were making all day for the
13579,LOUISA MANNERS,"sheep-shearing supper. Sarah said, a sheep-shearing was not to be"
13580,LOUISA MANNERS,"compared to a harvest-home, _that_ was so much better, for that then"
13581,LOUISA MANNERS,"the oven was quite full of plum-pudding, and the kitchen was very hot"
13582,LOUISA MANNERS,indeed with roasting beef; yet I can assure you there was no want at
13583,LOUISA MANNERS,all of either roast beef or plum-pudding at the sheep-shearing.
13584,LOUISA MANNERS,
13585,LOUISA MANNERS,"My sister and I were permitted to sit up till it was almost dark, to"
13586,LOUISA MANNERS,"see the company at supper. They sate at a long oak table, which was"
13587,LOUISA MANNERS,"finely carved, and as bright as a looking-glass."
13588,LOUISA MANNERS,
13589,LOUISA MANNERS,"I obtained a great deal of praise that day, because I replied so"
13590,LOUISA MANNERS,prettily when I was spoken to. My sister was more shy than me; never
13591,LOUISA MANNERS,having lived in London was the reason of that. After the happiest day
13592,LOUISA MANNERS,bedtime will come! We sate up late; but at last grandmamma sent us to
13593,LOUISA MANNERS,bed: yet though we went to bed we heard many charming songs sung: to
13594,LOUISA MANNERS,"be sure we could not distinguish the words, which was a pity, but the"
13595,LOUISA MANNERS,sound of their voices was very loud and very fine indeed.
13596,LOUISA MANNERS,
13597,LOUISA MANNERS,The common supper that we had every night was very cheerful. Just
13598,LOUISA MANNERS,"before the men came out of the field, a large faggot was flung on the"
13599,LOUISA MANNERS,"fire; the wood used to crackle and blaze, and smell delightfully: and"
13600,LOUISA MANNERS,"then the crickets, for they loved the fire, they used to sing, and old"
13601,LOUISA MANNERS,"Spot, the shepherd, who loved the fire as well as the crickets did,"
13602,LOUISA MANNERS,he used to take his place in the chimney corner; after the hottest
13603,LOUISA MANNERS,"day in summer, there old Spot used to sit. It was a seat within the"
13604,LOUISA MANNERS,"fire-place, quite under the chimney, and over his head the bacon hung."
13605,LOUISA MANNERS,
13606,LOUISA MANNERS,"When old Spot was seated, the milk was hung in a skillet over the"
13607,LOUISA MANNERS,"fire, and then the men used to come and sit down at the long white"
13608,LOUISA MANNERS,table.

13617,LOUISA MANNERS,"questions concerning your papa and your mamma, which led you to speak"
13618,LOUISA MANNERS,of your journey home: but your little town-bred head was so full of
13619,LOUISA MANNERS,"the pleasures of a country life, that you first made many apologies"
13620,LOUISA MANNERS,"that you were unable to tell what happened during the harvest, as"
13621,LOUISA MANNERS,unfortunately you were fetched home the very day before it began._

13630,ANN WITHERS,(_By Mary Lamb_)
13631,ANN WITHERS,
13632,ANN WITHERS,
13633,ANN WITHERS,"My name you know is Withers, but as I once thought I was the daughter"
13634,ANN WITHERS,"of sir Edward and lady Harriot Lesley, I shall speak of myself as"
13635,ANN WITHERS,"miss Lesley, and call sir Edward and lady Harriot my father and"
13636,ANN WITHERS,mother during the period I supposed them entitled to those beloved
13637,ANN WITHERS,"names. When I was a little girl, it was the perpetual subject of my"
13638,ANN WITHERS,"contemplation, that I was an heiress, and the daughter of a baronet;"
13639,ANN WITHERS,that my mother was the honourable lady Harriot; that we had a nobler
13640,ANN WITHERS,"mansion, infinitely finer pleasure-grounds, and equipages more"
13641,ANN WITHERS,"splendid than any of the neighbouring families. Indeed, my good"
13642,ANN WITHERS,"friends, having observed nothing of this error of mine in either of"
13643,ANN WITHERS,"the lives which have hitherto been related, I am ashamed to confess"
13644,ANN WITHERS,"what a proud child I once was. How it happened I cannot tell, for"
13645,ANN WITHERS,"my father was esteemed the best bred man in the county, and the"
13646,ANN WITHERS,condescension and affability of my mother were universally spoken of.
13647,ANN WITHERS,
13648,ANN WITHERS,"""Oh my dear friend,"" said miss ----, ""it was very natural indeed, if"
13649,ANN WITHERS,you supposed you possessed these advantages. We make no comparative
13650,ANN WITHERS,"figure in the county, and my father was originally a man of no"
13651,ANN WITHERS,"consideration at all; and yet I can assure you, both he and mamma had"
13652,ANN WITHERS,"a prodigious deal of trouble to break me of this infirmity, when I was"
13653,ANN WITHERS,"very young."" ""And do reflect for a moment,"" said miss Villiers, ""from"
13654,ANN WITHERS,whence could proceed any pride in me--a poor curate's daughter;--at
13655,ANN WITHERS,least any pride worth speaking of; for the difficulty my father had to
13656,ANN WITHERS,make me feel myself on an equality with a miller's little daughter who
13657,ANN WITHERS,"visited me, did not seem an anecdote worth relating. My father, from"
13658,ANN WITHERS,"his profession, is accustomed to look into these things, and whenever"
13659,ANN WITHERS,"he has observed any tendency to this fault in me, and has made me"
13660,ANN WITHERS,"sensible of my error, I, who am rather a weak-spirited girl, have been"
13661,ANN WITHERS,"so much distressed at his reproofs, that to restore me to my own good"
13662,ANN WITHERS,"opinion, he would make me sensible that pride is a defect inseparable"
13663,ANN WITHERS,"from human nature; shewing me, in our visits to the poorest labourers,"
13664,ANN WITHERS,"how pride would, as he expressed it, ""prettily peep out from under"
13665,ANN WITHERS,"their ragged garbs.""--My father dearly loved the poor. In persons of"
13666,ANN WITHERS,"a rank superior to our own humble one, I wanted not much assistance"
13667,ANN WITHERS,from my father's nice discernment to know that it existed there; and
13668,ANN WITHERS,"for these latter he would always claim that toleration from me, which"
13669,ANN WITHERS,he said he observed I was less willing to allow than to the former
13670,ANN WITHERS,"instances. ""We are told in holy writ,"" he would say, ""that it is"
13671,ANN WITHERS,"easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a"
13672,ANN WITHERS,"rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven."" Surely this is not"
13673,ANN WITHERS,meant alone to warn the affluent: it must also be understood as an
13674,ANN WITHERS,"expressive illustration, to instruct the lowly-fortuned man that he"
13675,ANN WITHERS,"should bear with those imperfections, inseparable from that dangerous"
13676,ANN WITHERS,"prosperity from which he is happily exempt.""--But we sadly interrupt"
13677,ANN WITHERS,your story.--
13678,ANN WITHERS,
13679,ANN WITHERS,"""You are very kind, ladies, to speak with so much indulgence of my"
13680,ANN WITHERS,"foible,"" said miss Withers, and was going to proceed, when little"
13681,ANN WITHERS,"Louisa Manners asked, ""Pray, are not equipages carriages?"" ""Yes, miss"
13682,ANN WITHERS,"Manners, an equipage is a carriage."" ""Then I am sure if my papa had"
13683,ANN WITHERS,but one equipage I should be very proud; for once when my papa talked
13684,ANN WITHERS,"of keeping a one-horse chaise, I never was so proud of any thing"
13685,ANN WITHERS,"in my life: I used to dream of riding in it, and imagine I saw my"
13686,ANN WITHERS,"playfellows walking past me in the streets."""
13687,ANN WITHERS,
13688,ANN WITHERS,"""Oh, my dear miss Manners,"" replied miss Withers, ""your young head"
13689,ANN WITHERS,might well run on a thing so new to you; but you have preached an
13690,ANN WITHERS,"useful lesson to me in your own pretty rambling story, which I shall"
13691,ANN WITHERS,not easily forget. When you were speaking with such delight of the
13692,ANN WITHERS,"pleasure the sight of a farm-yard, an orchard, and a narrow slip of"
13693,ANN WITHERS,"kitchen-garden, gave you, and could for years preserve so lively"
13694,ANN WITHERS,"the memory of one short ride, and that probably through a flat"
13695,ANN WITHERS,"uninteresting country, I remembered how early I learned to disregard"
13696,ANN WITHERS,"the face of Nature, unless she were decked in picturesque scenery; how"
13697,ANN WITHERS,"wearisome our parks and grounds became to me, unless some improvements"
13698,ANN WITHERS,were going forward which I thought would attract notice: but those
13699,ANN WITHERS,"days are gone.--I will now proceed in my story, and bring you"
13700,ANN WITHERS,acquainted with my real parents.
13701,ANN WITHERS,
13702,ANN WITHERS,"Alas! I am a changeling, substituted by my mother for the heiress of"
13703,ANN WITHERS,"the Lesley family: it was for my sake she did this naughty deed; yet,"
13704,ANN WITHERS,"since the truth has been known, it seems to me as if I had been the"
13705,ANN WITHERS,only sufferer by it; remembering no time when I was not Harriot
13706,ANN WITHERS,"Lesley, it seems as if the change had taken from me my birthright."
13707,ANN WITHERS,
13708,ANN WITHERS,Lady Harriot had intended to nurse her child herself; but being seized
13709,ANN WITHERS,"with a violent fever soon after its birth, she was not only unable to"
13710,ANN WITHERS,"nurse it, but even to see it, for several weeks. At this time I was"
13711,ANN WITHERS,"not quite a month old, when my mother was hired to be miss Lesley's"
13712,ANN WITHERS,nurse--she had once been a servant in the family--her husband was then
13713,ANN WITHERS,at sea.
13714,ANN WITHERS,
13715,ANN WITHERS,"She had been nursing miss Lesley a few days, when a girl who had the"
13716,ANN WITHERS,care of me brought me into the nursery to see my mother. It happened
13717,ANN WITHERS,"that she wanted something from her own home, which she dispatched the"
13718,ANN WITHERS,"girl to fetch, and desired her to leave me till her return. In her"
13719,ANN WITHERS,absence she changed our clothes: then keeping me to personate the
13720,ANN WITHERS,"child she was nursing, she sent away the daughter of sir Edward to be"
13721,ANN WITHERS,brought up in her own poor cottage.
13722,ANN WITHERS,
13723,ANN WITHERS,"When my mother sent away the girl, she affirmed she had not the least"
13724,ANN WITHERS,intention of committing this bad action; but after she was left alone
13725,ANN WITHERS,"with us, she looked on me, and then on the little lady-babe, and she"
13726,ANN WITHERS,wept over me to think she was obliged to leave me to the charge of
13727,ANN WITHERS,"a careless girl, debarred from my own natural food, while she was"
13728,ANN WITHERS,nursing another person's child.
13729,ANN WITHERS,
13730,ANN WITHERS,The laced cap and the fine cambric robe of the little Harriot were
13731,ANN WITHERS,"lying on the table ready to be put on: in these she dressed me, only"
13732,ANN WITHERS,just to see how pretty her own dear baby would look in missy's fine
13733,ANN WITHERS,"clothes. When she saw me thus adorned, she said to me, ""O, my dear"
13734,ANN WITHERS,"Ann, you look as like missy as any thing can be. I am sure my lady"
13735,ANN WITHERS,"herself, if she were well enough to see you, would not know the"
13736,ANN WITHERS,"difference."" She said these words aloud, and while she was speaking,"
13737,ANN WITHERS,a wicked thought came into her head--How easy it would be to change
13738,ANN WITHERS,these children! On which she hastily dressed Harriot in my coarse
13739,ANN WITHERS,raiment. She had no sooner finished the transformation of miss Lesley
13740,ANN WITHERS,"into the poor Ann Withers, than the girl returned, and carried her"
13741,ANN WITHERS,"away, without the least suspicion that it was not the same infant that"
13742,ANN WITHERS,she had brought thither.
13743,ANN WITHERS,
13744,ANN WITHERS,It was wonderful that no one discovered that I was not the same child.
13745,ANN WITHERS,"Every fresh face that came into the room, filled the nurse with"
13746,ANN WITHERS,terror. The servants still continued to pay their compliments to the
13747,ANN WITHERS,"baby in the same form as usual, saying, How like it is to its papa!"
13748,ANN WITHERS,"Nor did sir Edward himself perceive the difference, his lady's illness"
13749,ANN WITHERS,probably engrossing all his attention at the time; though indeed
13750,ANN WITHERS,gentlemen seldom take much notice of very young children.
13751,ANN WITHERS,
13752,ANN WITHERS,"When lady Harriot began to recover, and the nurse saw me in her arms"
13753,ANN WITHERS,"caressed as her own child, all fears of detection were over; but the"
13754,ANN WITHERS,pangs of remorse then seized her: as the dear sick lady hung with
13755,ANN WITHERS,"tears of fondness over me, she thought she should have died with"
13756,ANN WITHERS,sorrow for having so cruelly deceived her.
13757,ANN WITHERS,
13758,ANN WITHERS,When I was a year old Mrs. Withers was discharged; and because she had
13759,ANN WITHERS,"been observed to nurse me with uncommon care and affection, and was"
13760,ANN WITHERS,seen to shed many tears at parting from me; to reward her fidelity sir
13761,ANN WITHERS,"Edward settled a small pension on her, and she was allowed to come"
13762,ANN WITHERS,"every Sunday to dine in the housekeeper's room, and see her little"
13763,ANN WITHERS,lady.
13764,ANN WITHERS,
13765,ANN WITHERS,When she went home it might have been expected she would have
13766,ANN WITHERS,neglected the child she had so wickedly stolen; instead of which she
13767,ANN WITHERS,"nursed it with the greatest tenderness, being very sorry for what"
13768,ANN WITHERS,she had done: all the ease she could ever find for her troubled
13769,ANN WITHERS,"conscience, was in her extreme care of this injured child; and in the"
13770,ANN WITHERS,weekly visits to its father's house she constantly brought it with
13771,ANN WITHERS,"her. At the time I have the earliest recollection of her, she was"
13772,ANN WITHERS,"become a widow, and with the pension sir Edward allowed her, and some"
13773,ANN WITHERS,"plain work she did for our family, she maintained herself and her"
13774,ANN WITHERS,supposed daughter. The doting fondness she shewed for her child was
13775,ANN WITHERS,"much talked of; it was said, she waited upon it more like a servant"
13776,ANN WITHERS,"than a mother, and it was observed, its clothes were always made, as"
13777,ANN WITHERS,"far as her slender means would permit, in the same fashion, and her"
13778,ANN WITHERS,"hair cut and curled in the same form as mine. To this person, as"
13779,ANN WITHERS,"having been my faithful nurse, and to her child, I was always taught"
13780,ANN WITHERS,"to shew particular civility, and the little girl was always brought"
13781,ANN WITHERS,"into the nursery to play with me. Ann was a little delicate thing, and"
13782,ANN WITHERS,remarkably well-behaved; for though so much indulged in every other
13783,ANN WITHERS,"respect, my mother was very attentive to her manners."
13784,ANN WITHERS,
13785,ANN WITHERS,"As the child grew older, my mother became very uneasy about her"
13786,ANN WITHERS,"education. She was so very desirous of having her well-behaved, that"
13787,ANN WITHERS,"she feared to send her to school, lest she should learn ill manners"
13788,ANN WITHERS,"among the village children, with whom she never suffered her to play;"
13789,ANN WITHERS,"and she was such a poor scholar herself, that she could teach her"
13790,ANN WITHERS,little or nothing. I heard her relate this her distress to my own
13791,ANN WITHERS,"maid, with tears in her eyes, and I formed a resolution to beg of my"
13792,ANN WITHERS,"parents that I might have Ann for a companion, and that she might be"
13793,ANN WITHERS,allowed to take lessons with me of my governess.
13794,ANN WITHERS,
13795,ANN WITHERS,"My birth-day was then approaching, and on that day I was always"
13796,ANN WITHERS,indulged in the privilege of asking some peculiar favour.
13797,ANN WITHERS,
13798,ANN WITHERS,"""And what boon has my annual petitioner to beg to-day?"" said my"
13799,ANN WITHERS,"father, as he entered the breakfast-room on the morning of my"
13800,ANN WITHERS,birth-day. Then I told him of the great anxiety expressed by nurse
13801,ANN WITHERS,Withers concerning her daughter; how much she wished it was in her
13802,ANN WITHERS,"power to give her an education, that would enable her to get her"
13803,ANN WITHERS,living without hard labour. I set the good qualities of Ann Withers
13804,ANN WITHERS,"in the best light I could, and in conclusion I begged she might be"
13805,ANN WITHERS,"permitted to partake with me in education, and become my companion."
13806,ANN WITHERS,"""This is a very serious request indeed, Harriot,"" said sir Edward;"
13807,ANN WITHERS,"""your mother and I must consult together on the subject."" The result"
13808,ANN WITHERS,of this consultation was favourable to my wishes: in a few weeks my
13809,ANN WITHERS,"foster-sister was taken into the house, and placed under the tuition"
13810,ANN WITHERS,of my governess.
13811,ANN WITHERS,
13812,ANN WITHERS,"To me, who had hitherto lived without any companions of my own age"
13813,ANN WITHERS,"except occasional visitors, the idea of a playfellow constantly to"
13814,ANN WITHERS,"associate with, was very pleasant; and, after the first shyness of"
13815,ANN WITHERS,"feeling her altered situation was over, Ann seemed as much at her ease"
13816,ANN WITHERS,as if she had always been brought up in our house. I became very fond
13817,ANN WITHERS,"of her, and took pleasure in shewing her all manner of attentions;"
13818,ANN WITHERS,"which so far won on her affections, that she told me she had a secret"
13819,ANN WITHERS,"intrusted to her by her mother, which she had promised never to reveal"
13820,ANN WITHERS,"as long as her mother lived, but that she almost wished to confide it"
13821,ANN WITHERS,"to me, because I was such a kind friend to her; yet, having promised"
13822,ANN WITHERS,"never to tell it till the death of her mother, she was afraid to tell"
13823,ANN WITHERS,it to me. At first I assured her that I would never press her to the
13824,ANN WITHERS,"disclosure, for that promises of secrecy were to be held sacred; but"
13825,ANN WITHERS,"whenever we fell into any confidential kind of conversation, this"
13826,ANN WITHERS,secret seemed always ready to come out. Whether she or I were most to
13827,ANN WITHERS,"blame I know not, though I own I could not help giving frequent hints"
13828,ANN WITHERS,how well I could keep a secret. At length she told me what I have
13829,ANN WITHERS,"before related, namely, that she was in truth the daughter of sir"
13830,ANN WITHERS,"Edward and lady Lesley, and I the child of her supposed mother."
13831,ANN WITHERS,
13832,ANN WITHERS,"When I was first in possession of this wonderful secret, my heart"
13833,ANN WITHERS,burned to reveal it. I thought how praiseworthy it would be in me to
13834,ANN WITHERS,restore to my friend the rights of her birth; yet I thought only of
13835,ANN WITHERS,"becoming her patroness, and raising her to her proper rank; it never"
13836,ANN WITHERS,occurred to me that my own degradation must necessarily follow. I
13837,ANN WITHERS,endeavoured to persuade her to let me tell this important affair to
13838,ANN WITHERS,my parents: this she positively refused. I expressed wonder that she
13839,ANN WITHERS,"should so faithfully keep this secret for an unworthy woman, who"
13840,ANN WITHERS,"in her infancy had done her such an injury. ""Oh,"" said she, ""you"
13841,ANN WITHERS,"do not know how much she loves me, or you would not wonder that I"
13842,ANN WITHERS,never resent that. I have seen her grieve and be so very sorry on my
13843,ANN WITHERS,"account, that I would not bring her into more trouble for any good"
13844,ANN WITHERS,"that could happen to myself. She has often told me, that since the day"
13845,ANN WITHERS,"she changed us, she has never known what it is to have a happy moment;"
13846,ANN WITHERS,"and when she returned home from nursing you, finding me very thin and"
13847,ANN WITHERS,"sickly, how her heart smote her for what she had done; and then she"
13848,ANN WITHERS,"nursed and fed me with such anxious care, that she grew much fonder"
13849,ANN WITHERS,"of me than if I had been her own; and that on the Sundays, when she"
13850,ANN WITHERS,"used to bring me here, it was more pleasure to her to see me in my"
13851,ANN WITHERS,"own father's house, than it was to her to see you her real child."
13852,ANN WITHERS,"The shyness you shewed towards her while you were very young, and"
13853,ANN WITHERS,"the forced civility you seemed to affect as you grew older, always"
13854,ANN WITHERS,appeared like ingratitude towards her who had done so much for you. My
13855,ANN WITHERS,"mother has desired me to disclose this after her death, but I do not"
13856,ANN WITHERS,"believe I shall ever mention it then, for I should be sorry to bring"
13857,ANN WITHERS,"any reproach even on her memory."""
13858,ANN WITHERS,
13859,ANN WITHERS,"In a few days after this important discovery, Ann was sent home to"
13860,ANN WITHERS,"pass a few weeks with her mother, on the occasion of the expected"
13861,ANN WITHERS,arrival of some visitors to our house; they were to bring children
13862,ANN WITHERS,"with them, and these I was to consider as my own guests."
13863,ANN WITHERS,
13864,ANN WITHERS,"In the expected arrival of my young visitants, and in making"
13865,ANN WITHERS,"preparations to entertain them, I had little leisure to deliberate"
13866,ANN WITHERS,on what conduct I should pursue with regard to my friend's secret.
13867,ANN WITHERS,Something must be done I thought to make her amends for the injury
13868,ANN WITHERS,"she had sustained, and I resolved to consider the matter attentively"
13869,ANN WITHERS,on her return. Still my mind ran on conferring favours. I never
13870,ANN WITHERS,considered myself as transformed into the dependant person. Indeed sir
13871,ANN WITHERS,Edward at this time set me about a task which occupied the whole of my
13872,ANN WITHERS,attention; he proposed that I should write a little interlude after
13873,ANN WITHERS,"the manner of the French Petites Pieces; and to try my ingenuity, no"
13874,ANN WITHERS,"one was to see it before the representation except the performers,"
13875,ANN WITHERS,"myself and my little friends, who as they were all younger than me,"
13876,ANN WITHERS,could not be expected to lend me much assistance. I have already
13877,ANN WITHERS,"told you what a proud girl I was. During the writing of this piece,"
13878,ANN WITHERS,"the receiving of my young friends, and the instructing them in their"
13879,ANN WITHERS,"several parts, I never felt myself of more importance. With Ann my"
13880,ANN WITHERS,pride had somewhat slumbered; the difference of our rank left no room
13881,ANN WITHERS,"for competition; all was complacency and good humour on my part, and"
13882,ANN WITHERS,"affectionate gratitude, tempered with respect, on hers. But here I had"
13883,ANN WITHERS,"full room to shew courtesy, to affect those graces--to imitate that"
13884,ANN WITHERS,elegance of manners practised by lady Harriot to their mothers. I was
13885,ANN WITHERS,"to be their instructress in action and in attitudes, and to receive"
13886,ANN WITHERS,their praises and their admiration of my theatrical genius. It was a
13887,ANN WITHERS,"new scene of triumph for me, and I might then be said to be in the"
13888,ANN WITHERS,very height of my glory.
13889,ANN WITHERS,
13890,ANN WITHERS,"If the plot of my piece, for the invention of which they so highly"
13891,ANN WITHERS,"praised me, had been indeed my own, all would have been well; but"
13892,ANN WITHERS,unhappily I borrowed from a source which made my drama end far
13893,ANN WITHERS,differently from what I intended it should. In the catastrophe I lost
13894,ANN WITHERS,"not only the name I personated in the piece, but with it my own name"
13895,ANN WITHERS,also; and all my rank and consequence in the world fled from me for
13896,ANN WITHERS,ever.--My father presented me with a beautiful writing-desk for the
13897,ANN WITHERS,use of my new authorship. My silver standish was placed upon it; a
13898,ANN WITHERS,quire of gilt paper was before me. I took out a parcel of my best crow
13899,ANN WITHERS,"quills, and down I sate in the greatest form imaginable."
13900,ANN WITHERS,
13901,ANN WITHERS,I conjecture I have no talent for invention; certain it is that when I
13902,ANN WITHERS,"sate down to compose my piece, no story would come into my head, but"
13903,ANN WITHERS,the story which Ann had so lately related to me. Many sheets were
13904,ANN WITHERS,"scrawled over in vain, I could think of nothing else; still the babies"
13905,ANN WITHERS,and the nurse were before me in all the minutiæ of description Ann
13906,ANN WITHERS,"had given them. The costly attire of the lady-babe,--the homely garb"
13907,ANN WITHERS,"of the cottage-infant,--the affecting address of the fond mother to"
13908,ANN WITHERS,her own offspring;--then the charming équivoque in the change of
13909,ANN WITHERS,the children: it all looked so dramatic:--it was a play ready made
13910,ANN WITHERS,"to my hands. The invalid mother would form the pathetic, the silly"
13911,ANN WITHERS,"exclamations of the servants the ludicrous, and the nurse was nature"
13912,ANN WITHERS,"itself. It is true I had a few scruples, that it might, should it"
13913,ANN WITHERS,"come to the knowledge of Ann, be construed into something very like"
13914,ANN WITHERS,"a breach of confidence. But she was at home, and might never happen"
13915,ANN WITHERS,"to hear of the subject of my piece, and if she did, why it was only"
13916,ANN WITHERS,"making some handsome apology.--To a dependant companion, to whom I"
13917,ANN WITHERS,"had been so very great a friend, it was not necessary to be so very"
13918,ANN WITHERS,particular about such a trifle.
13919,ANN WITHERS,
13920,ANN WITHERS,"Thus I reasoned as I wrote my drama, beginning with the title, which"
13921,ANN WITHERS,"I called ""The Changeling,"" and ending with these words, _The curtain"
13922,ANN WITHERS,"drops, while the lady clasps the baby in her arms, and the nurse sighs"
13923,ANN WITHERS,"audibly_. I invented no new incident, I simply wrote the story as Ann"
13924,ANN WITHERS,"had told it to me, in the best blank verse I was able to compose."
13925,ANN WITHERS,
13926,ANN WITHERS,By the time it was finished the company had arrived. The casting the
13927,ANN WITHERS,"different parts was my next care. The honourable Augustus M----, a"
13928,ANN WITHERS,"young gentleman of five years of age, undertook to play the father. He"
13929,ANN WITHERS,"was only to come in and say, _How does my little darling do to-day?_"
13930,ANN WITHERS,"The three miss ----'s were to be the servants, they too had only"
13931,ANN WITHERS,single lines to speak.
13932,ANN WITHERS,
13933,ANN WITHERS,"As these four were all very young performers, we made them rehearse"
13934,ANN WITHERS,"many times over, that they might walk in and out with proper decorum;"
13935,ANN WITHERS,but the performance was stopped before their entrances and their exits
13936,ANN WITHERS,"arrived. I complimented lady Elizabeth, the sister of Augustus, who"
13937,ANN WITHERS,"was the eldest of the young ladies, with the choice of the Lady Mother"
13938,ANN WITHERS,"or the nurse. She fixed on the former; she was to recline on a sofa,"
13939,ANN WITHERS,"and, affecting ill health, speak some eight or ten lines which began"
13940,ANN WITHERS,"with, _O that I could my precious baby see!_ To her cousin miss Emily"
13941,ANN WITHERS,---- was given the girl who had the care of the nurse's child; two
13942,ANN WITHERS,"dolls were to personate the two children, and the principal character"
13943,ANN WITHERS,"of the nurse, I had the pleasure to perform myself. It consisted of"
13944,ANN WITHERS,"several speeches, and a very long soliloquy during the changing of the"
13945,ANN WITHERS,children's clothes.
13946,ANN WITHERS,
13947,ANN WITHERS,"The elder brother of Augustus, a gentleman of fifteen years of age,"
13948,ANN WITHERS,"who refused to mix in our childish drama, yet condescended to paint"
13949,ANN WITHERS,"the scenes, and our dresses were got up by my own maid."
13950,ANN WITHERS,
13951,ANN WITHERS,"When we thought ourselves quite perfect in our several parts, we"
13952,ANN WITHERS,"announced it for representation. Sir Edward and lady Harriot, with"
13953,ANN WITHERS,"their visitors, the parents of my young troop of comedians, honoured"
13954,ANN WITHERS,us with their presence. The servants were also permitted to go into a
13955,ANN WITHERS,"music gallery, which was at the end of a ball-room we had chosen for"
13956,ANN WITHERS,our theatre.
13957,ANN WITHERS,
13958,ANN WITHERS,"As author, and principal performer, standing before a noble audience,"
13959,ANN WITHERS,"my mind was too much engaged with the arduous task I had undertaken,"
13960,ANN WITHERS,"to glance my eyes towards the music gallery, or I might have seen two"
13961,ANN WITHERS,more spectators there than I expected. Nurse Withers and her daughter
13962,ANN WITHERS,Ann were there; they had been invited by the housekeeper to be present
13963,ANN WITHERS,at the representation of miss Lesley's first piece.
13964,ANN WITHERS,
13965,ANN WITHERS,"In the midst of the performance, as I, in the character of the nurse,"
13966,ANN WITHERS,"was delivering the wrong child to the girl, there was an exclamation"
13967,ANN WITHERS,"from the music gallery, of ""Oh, it's all true! it's all true!"" This"
13968,ANN WITHERS,"was followed by a bustle among the servants, and screams as of a"
13969,ANN WITHERS,person in a hysteric fit. Sir Edward came forward to enquire what was
13970,ANN WITHERS,the matter. He saw it was Mrs. Withers who had fallen into a fit. Ann
13971,ANN WITHERS,"was weeping over her, and crying out, ""O miss Lesley, you have told"
13972,ANN WITHERS,"all in the play!"""
13973,ANN WITHERS,
13974,ANN WITHERS,"Mrs. Withers was brought out into the ball-room; there, with tears and"
13975,ANN WITHERS,"in broken accents, with every sign of terror and remorse, she soon"
13976,ANN WITHERS,made a full confession of her so long concealed guilt.
13977,ANN WITHERS,
13978,ANN WITHERS,"The strangers assembled to see our childish mimicry of passion,"
13979,ANN WITHERS,were witness to a highly wrought dramatic scene in real life. I had
13980,ANN WITHERS,intended they should see the curtain drop without any discovery of
13981,ANN WITHERS,"the deceit; unable to invent any new incident, I left the conclusion"
13982,ANN WITHERS,imperfect as I found it: but they saw a more strict poetical justice
13983,ANN WITHERS,"done; they saw the rightful child restored to its parents, and the"
13984,ANN WITHERS,"nurse overwhelmed with shame, and threatened with the severest"
13985,ANN WITHERS,punishment.
13986,ANN WITHERS,
13987,ANN WITHERS,"""Take this woman,"" said sir Edward, ""and lock her up, till she be"
13988,ANN WITHERS,"delivered into the hands of justice."""
13989,ANN WITHERS,
13990,ANN WITHERS,"Ann, on her knees, implored mercy for her mother.--Addressing the"
13991,ANN WITHERS,"children who were gathered round her, ""Dear ladies,"" said she, ""help"
13992,ANN WITHERS,"me, on your knees help me to beg forgiveness for my mother."" Down"
13993,ANN WITHERS,"the young ones all dropped--even lady Elizabeth bent her knee. ""Sir"
13994,ANN WITHERS,"Edward, pity her distress. Sir Edward, pardon her!"" All joined in the"
13995,ANN WITHERS,"petition, except one whose voice ought to have been loudest in the"
13996,ANN WITHERS,"appeal. No word, no accent came from me. I hung over lady Harriot's"
13997,ANN WITHERS,"chair, weeping as if my heart would break; but I wept for my own"
13998,ANN WITHERS,"fallen fortunes, not for my mother's sorrow."
13999,ANN WITHERS,
14000,ANN WITHERS,"I thought within myself, if in the integrity of my heart, refusing to"
14001,ANN WITHERS,"participate in this unjust secret, I had boldly ventured to publish"
14002,ANN WITHERS,"the truth, I might have had some consolation in the praises which so"
14003,ANN WITHERS,generous an action would have merited: but it is through the vanity
14004,ANN WITHERS,"of being supposed to have written a pretty story, that I have meanly"
14005,ANN WITHERS,"broken my faith with my friend, and unintentionally proclaimed the"
14006,ANN WITHERS,disgrace of my mother and myself. While thoughts like these were
14007,ANN WITHERS,"passing through my mind, Ann had obtained my mother's pardon. Instead"
14008,ANN WITHERS,"of being sent away to confinement and the horrors of a prison, she was"
14009,ANN WITHERS,"given by sir Edward into the care of the housekeeper, who had orders"
14010,ANN WITHERS,"from lady Harriot to see her put to bed and properly attended to, for"
14011,ANN WITHERS,again this wretched woman had fallen into a fit.
14012,ANN WITHERS,
14013,ANN WITHERS,"Ann would have followed my mother, but sir Edward brought her back,"
14014,ANN WITHERS,telling her that she should see her when she was better. He then led
14015,ANN WITHERS,"Ann towards lady Harriot, desiring her to embrace her child; she did"
14016,ANN WITHERS,"so, and I saw her, as I had phrased it in the play, _clasped in her"
14017,ANN WITHERS,mother's arms_.
14018,ANN WITHERS,
14019,ANN WITHERS,This scene had greatly affected the spirits of lady Harriot; through
14020,ANN WITHERS,the whole of it it was with difficulty she had been kept from
14021,ANN WITHERS,"fainting, and she was now led into the drawing-room by the ladies."
14022,ANN WITHERS,"The gentlemen followed, talking with sir Edward of the astonishing"
14023,ANN WITHERS,instance of filial affection they had just seen in the earnest
14024,ANN WITHERS,pleadings of the child for her supposed mother.
14025,ANN WITHERS,
14026,ANN WITHERS,"Ann too went with them, and was conducted by her whom I had always"
14027,ANN WITHERS,considered as my own particular friend. Lady Elizabeth took hold of
14028,ANN WITHERS,"her hand, and said, ""Miss Lesley, will you permit me to conduct you to"
14029,ANN WITHERS,"the drawing-room?"""
14030,ANN WITHERS,
14031,ANN WITHERS,"I was left weeping behind the chair where lady Harriot had sate, and,"
14032,ANN WITHERS,"as I thought, quite alone. A something had before twitched my frock"
14033,ANN WITHERS,"two or three times, so slightly I had scarcely noticed it; a little"
14034,ANN WITHERS,"head now peeped round, and looking up in my face said, ""She is not"
14035,ANN WITHERS,"miss Lesley:"" it was the young Augustus; he had been sitting at my"
14036,ANN WITHERS,"feet, but I had not observed him. He then started up, and taking hold"
14037,ANN WITHERS,"of my hand with one of his, with the other holding fast by my clothes,"
14038,ANN WITHERS,"he led, or rather dragged me, into the midst of the company assembled"
14039,ANN WITHERS,"in the drawing-room. The vehemence of his manner, his little face as"
14040,ANN WITHERS,"red as fire, caught every eye. The ladies smiled, and one gentleman"
14041,ANN WITHERS,laughed in a most unfeeling manner. His elder brother patted him on
14042,ANN WITHERS,"the head, and said, ""You are a humane little fellow. Elizabeth, we"
14043,ANN WITHERS,"might have thought of this."""
14044,ANN WITHERS,
14045,ANN WITHERS,"Very kind words were now spoken to me by sir Edward, and he called me"
14046,ANN WITHERS,"Harriot, precious name now grown to me. Lady Harriot kissed me, and"
14047,ANN WITHERS,said she would never forget how long she had loved me as her child.
14048,ANN WITHERS,"These were comfortable words; but I heard echoed round the room, ""Poor"
14049,ANN WITHERS,"thing, she cannot help it.--I am sure she is to be pitied.--Dear lady"
14050,ANN WITHERS,"Harriot, how kind, how considerate you are!"" Ah! what a deep sense of"
14051,ANN WITHERS,my altered condition did I then feel!
14052,ANN WITHERS,
14053,ANN WITHERS,"""Let the young ladies divert themselves in another room,"" said sir"
14054,ANN WITHERS,"Edward; ""and, Harriot, take your new sister with you, and help her"
14055,ANN WITHERS,"to entertain your friends."" Yes, he called me Harriot again, and"
14056,ANN WITHERS,"afterwards invented new names for his daughter and me, and always"
14057,ANN WITHERS,"called us by them, apparently in jest; yet I knew it was only because"
14058,ANN WITHERS,he would not hurt me with hearing our names reversed. When sir Edward
14059,ANN WITHERS,"desired us to shew the children into another room, Ann and I walked"
14060,ANN WITHERS,towards the door. A new sense of humiliation arose--how could I go
14061,ANN WITHERS,out at the door before miss Lesley?--I stood irresolute; she drew
14062,ANN WITHERS,back. The elder brother of my friend Augustus assisted me in this
14063,ANN WITHERS,"perplexity; pushing us all forward, as if in a playful mood, he drove"
14064,ANN WITHERS,"us indiscriminately before him, saying, ""I will make one among you"
14065,ANN WITHERS,"to-day."" He had never joined in our sports before."
14066,ANN WITHERS,
14067,ANN WITHERS,"My luckless Play, that sad instance of my duplicity, was never once"
14068,ANN WITHERS,"mentioned to me afterwards, not even by any one of the children who"
14069,ANN WITHERS,"had acted in it, and I must also tell you how considerate an old lady"
14070,ANN WITHERS,was at the time about our dresses. As soon as she perceived things
14071,ANN WITHERS,"growing very serious, she hastily stripped off the upper garments we"
14072,ANN WITHERS,wore to represent our different characters. I think I should have
14073,ANN WITHERS,"died with shame, if the child had led me into the drawing-room in the"
14074,ANN WITHERS,mummery I had worn to represent a nurse. This good lady was of another
14075,ANN WITHERS,essential service to me; for perceiving an irresolution in every one
14076,ANN WITHERS,"how they should behave to us, which distressed me very much, she"
14077,ANN WITHERS,"contrived to place miss Lesley above me at table, and called her miss"
14078,ANN WITHERS,"Lesley, and me miss Withers; saying at the same time in a low voice,"
14079,ANN WITHERS,"but as if she meant I should hear her, ""It is better these things"
14080,ANN WITHERS,"should be done at once, then they are over."" My heart thanked her, for"
14081,ANN WITHERS,I felt the truth of what she said.
14082,ANN WITHERS,
14083,ANN WITHERS,My poor mother continued very ill for many weeks: no medicine would
14084,ANN WITHERS,remove the extreme dejection of spirits she laboured under. Sir
14085,ANN WITHERS,Edward sent for the clergyman of the parish to give her religious
14086,ANN WITHERS,"consolation. Every day he came to visit her, and he would always take"
14087,ANN WITHERS,"miss Lesley and me into the room with him. I think, miss Villiers,"
14088,ANN WITHERS,"your father must be just such another man as Dr. Wheelding, our worthy"
14089,ANN WITHERS,rector; just so I think he would have soothed the troubled conscience
14090,ANN WITHERS,"of my repentant mother. How feelingly, how kindly he used to talk of"
14091,ANN WITHERS,mercy and forgiveness!
14092,ANN WITHERS,
14093,ANN WITHERS,"My heart was softened by my own misfortunes, and the sight of my"
14094,ANN WITHERS,penitent suffering mother. I felt that she was now my only parent; I
14095,ANN WITHERS,"strove, earnestly strove, to love her; yet ever when I looked in her"
14096,ANN WITHERS,"face, she would seem to me to be the very identical person whom I"
14097,ANN WITHERS,should have once thought sufficiently honoured by a slight inclination
14098,ANN WITHERS,"of the head, and a civil How do you do, Mrs. Withers? One day, as"
14099,ANN WITHERS,"miss Lesley was hanging over her, with her accustomed fondness, Dr."
14100,ANN WITHERS,"Wheelding reading in a prayer-book, and, as I thought, not at that"
14101,ANN WITHERS,"moment regarding us, I threw myself on my knees and silently prayed"
14102,ANN WITHERS,that I too might be able to love my mother.
14103,ANN WITHERS,
14104,ANN WITHERS,"Dr. Wheelding had been observing me: he took me into the garden, and"
14105,ANN WITHERS,"drew from me the subject of my petition. ""Your prayers, my good young"
14106,ANN WITHERS,"lady,"" said he, ""I hope are heard; sure I am they have caused me to"
14107,ANN WITHERS,"adopt a resolution, which, as it will enable you to see your mother"
14108,ANN WITHERS,"frequently, will, I hope, greatly assist your pious wishes."
14109,ANN WITHERS,
14110,ANN WITHERS,"""I will take your mother home with me to superintend my family. Under"
14111,ANN WITHERS,my roof doubtless sir Edward will often permit you to see her. Perform
14112,ANN WITHERS,your duty towards her as well as you possibly can.--Affection is the
14113,ANN WITHERS,"growth of time. With such good wishes in your young heart, do not"
14114,ANN WITHERS,"despair that in due time it will assuredly spring up."""
14115,ANN WITHERS,
14116,ANN WITHERS,"With the approbation of sir Edward and lady Harriot, my mother was"
14117,ANN WITHERS,removed in a few days to Dr. Wheelding's house: there she soon
14118,ANN WITHERS,recovered--there she at present resides. She tells me she loves me
14119,ANN WITHERS,"almost as well as she did when I was a baby, and we both wept at"
14120,ANN WITHERS,parting when I came to school.
14121,ANN WITHERS,
14122,ANN WITHERS,"Here perhaps I ought to conclude my story, which I fear has been a"
14123,ANN WITHERS,tedious one: permit me however to say a few words concerning the time
14124,ANN WITHERS,which elapsed since the discovery of my birth until my arrival here.
14125,ANN WITHERS,
14126,ANN WITHERS,"It was on the fifth day of ---- that I was known to be Ann Withers,"
14127,ANN WITHERS,and the daughter of my supposed nurse. The company who were witness to
14128,ANN WITHERS,"my disgrace departed in a few days, and I felt relieved from some part"
14129,ANN WITHERS,of the mortification I hourly experienced. For every fresh instance
14130,ANN WITHERS,"even of kindness or attention I experienced went to my heart, that I"
14131,ANN WITHERS,should be forced to feel thankful for it.
14132,ANN WITHERS,
14133,ANN WITHERS,"Circumstanced as I was, surely I had nothing justly to complain of."
14134,ANN WITHERS,The conduct of sir Edward and lady Harriot was kind in the extreme;
14135,ANN WITHERS,"still preserving every appearance of a parental tenderness for me,"
14136,ANN WITHERS,but ah! I might no longer call them by the dear names of father and
14137,ANN WITHERS,"mother.--Formerly when speaking of them, I used, proud of their"
14138,ANN WITHERS,"titles, to delight to say, ""Sir Edward or lady Harriot did this, or"
14139,ANN WITHERS,"this;"" now I would give worlds to say, ""My father or my mother."""
14140,ANN WITHERS,
14141,ANN WITHERS,I should be perfectly unkind if I were to complain of miss
14142,ANN WITHERS,"Lesley--indeed, I have not the least cause of complaint against her."
14143,ANN WITHERS,"As my companion, her affection and her gratitude had been unbounded;"
14144,ANN WITHERS,"and now that it was my turn to be the humble friend, she tried"
14145,ANN WITHERS,"by every means in her power, to make me think she felt the same"
14146,ANN WITHERS,"respectful gratitude, which in her dependant station she had so"
14147,ANN WITHERS,naturally displayed.
14148,ANN WITHERS,
14149,ANN WITHERS,"Only in a few rarely constituted minds, does that true attentive"
14150,ANN WITHERS,"kindness spring up, that delicacy of feeling, which enters into every"
14151,ANN WITHERS,"trivial thing, is ever awake and keeping watch lest it should offend."
14152,ANN WITHERS,"Myself, though educated with the extremest care, possessed but little"
14153,ANN WITHERS,"of this virtue. Virtue I call it, though among men it is termed"
14154,ANN WITHERS,"politeness, for since the days of my humiliating reverse of fortune I"
14155,ANN WITHERS,have learned its value.
14156,ANN WITHERS,
14157,ANN WITHERS,"I feel quite ashamed to give instances of any deficiency I observed,"
14158,ANN WITHERS,"or thought I have observed, in miss Lesley. Now I am away from her,"
14159,ANN WITHERS,"and dispassionately speaking of it, it seems as if my own soreness"
14160,ANN WITHERS,of temper had made me fancy things. I really believe now that I was
14161,ANN WITHERS,mistaken; but miss Lesley had been so highly praised for her filial
14162,ANN WITHERS,"tenderness, I thought at last she seemed to make a parade about it,"
14163,ANN WITHERS,"and used to run up to my mother, and affect to be more glad to see her"
14164,ANN WITHERS,than she really was after a time; and I think Dr. Wheelding thought
14165,ANN WITHERS,"so, by a little hint he once dropped. But he too might be mistaken,"
14166,ANN WITHERS,for he was very partial to me.
14167,ANN WITHERS,
14168,ANN WITHERS,I am under the greatest obligation in the world to this good Dr.
14169,ANN WITHERS,"Wheelding. He has made my mother quite a respectable woman, and I am"
14170,ANN WITHERS,sure it is owing a great deal to him that she loves me as well as she
14171,ANN WITHERS,does.
14172,ANN WITHERS,
14173,ANN WITHERS,"And here, though it may seem a little out of place, let me stop to"
14174,ANN WITHERS,"assure you, that if I ever could have had any doubt of the sincerity"
14175,ANN WITHERS,"of miss Lesley's affection towards me, her behaviour on the occasion"
14176,ANN WITHERS,of my coming here ought completely to efface it. She entreated with
14177,ANN WITHERS,"many tears, and almost the same energy with which she pleaded for"
14178,ANN WITHERS,"forgiveness for my mother, that I might not be sent away.--But she was"
14179,ANN WITHERS,not alike successful in her supplications.
14180,ANN WITHERS,
14181,ANN WITHERS,Miss Lesley had made some progress in reading and writing during the
14182,ANN WITHERS,"time she was my companion only, it was highly necessary that every"
14183,ANN WITHERS,"exertion should be now made--the whole house was, as I may say, in"
14184,ANN WITHERS,requisition for her instruction. Sir Edward and lady Harriot devoted
14185,ANN WITHERS,great part of the day to this purpose. A well educated young person
14186,ANN WITHERS,"was taken under our governess, to assist her in her labours, and to"
14187,ANN WITHERS,teach miss Lesley music. A drawing-master was engaged to reside in the
14188,ANN WITHERS,house.
14189,ANN WITHERS,
14190,ANN WITHERS,At this time I was not remarkably forward in my education. My
14191,ANN WITHERS,"governess being a native of France, I spoke French very correctly, and"
14192,ANN WITHERS,I had made some progress in Italian. I had only had the instruction of
14193,ANN WITHERS,masters during the few months in the year we usually passed in London.
14194,ANN WITHERS,
14195,ANN WITHERS,"Music I never had the least ear for, I could scarcely be taught my"
14196,ANN WITHERS,notes. This defect in me was always particularly regretted by my
14197,ANN WITHERS,"mother, she being an excellent performer herself both on the piano and"
14198,ANN WITHERS,on the harp.
14199,ANN WITHERS,
14200,ANN WITHERS,I think I have some taste for drawing; but as lady Harriot did not
14201,ANN WITHERS,"particularly excel in this, I lost so much time in the summer months,"
14202,ANN WITHERS,"practising only under my governess, that I made no great proficiency"
14203,ANN WITHERS,even in this my favourite art. But miss Lesley with all these
14204,ANN WITHERS,"advantages which I have named, every body so eager to instruct her,"
14205,ANN WITHERS,"she so willing to learn--every thing so new and delightful to her,"
14206,ANN WITHERS,how could it happen otherwise? she in a short time became a little
14207,ANN WITHERS,"prodigy. What best pleased lady Harriot was, after she had conquered"
14208,ANN WITHERS,"the first difficulties, she discovered a wonderful talent for"
14209,ANN WITHERS,music. Here she was her mother's own girl indeed--she had the same
14210,ANN WITHERS,sweet-toned voice--the same delicate finger.--Her musical governess
14211,ANN WITHERS,had little now to do; for as soon as lady Harriot perceived this
14212,ANN WITHERS,"excellence in her, she gave up all company, and devoted her whole time"
14213,ANN WITHERS,to instructing her daughter in this science.
14214,ANN WITHERS,
14215,ANN WITHERS,"Nothing makes the heart ache with such a hopeless, heavy pain, as"
14216,ANN WITHERS,envy.
14217,ANN WITHERS,
14218,ANN WITHERS,"I had felt deeply before, but till now I could not be said to envy"
14219,ANN WITHERS,miss Lesley.--All day long the notes of the harp or the piano spoke
14220,ANN WITHERS,"sad sounds to me, of the loss of a loved mother's heart."
14221,ANN WITHERS,
14222,ANN WITHERS,"To have, in a manner, two mothers, and miss Lesley to engross them"
14223,ANN WITHERS,"both, was too much indeed."
14224,ANN WITHERS,
14225,ANN WITHERS,It was at this time that one day I had been wearied with hearing
14226,ANN WITHERS,"lady Harriot play one long piece of Haydn's music after another, to"
14227,ANN WITHERS,her enraptured daughter. We were to walk with our governess to Dr.
14228,ANN WITHERS,"Wheelding's that morning; and after lady Harriot had left the room,"
14229,ANN WITHERS,"and we were quite ready for our walk, miss Lesley would not leave the"
14230,ANN WITHERS,instrument for I know not how long.
14231,ANN WITHERS,
14232,ANN WITHERS,It was on that day that I thought she was not quite honest in her
14233,ANN WITHERS,"expressions of joy at the sight of my poor mother, who had been"
14234,ANN WITHERS,waiting at the garden-gate near two hours to see her arrive; yet she
14235,ANN WITHERS,"might be, for the music had put her in remarkably good spirits that"
14236,ANN WITHERS,morning.
14237,ANN WITHERS,
14238,ANN WITHERS,"O the music quite, quite won lady Harriot's heart! Till miss Lesley"
14239,ANN WITHERS,"began to play so well, she often lamented the time it would take,"
14240,ANN WITHERS,before her daughter would have the air of a person of fashion's child.
14241,ANN WITHERS,It was my part of the general instruction to give her lessons on this
14242,ANN WITHERS,"head. We used to make a kind of play of it, which we called lectures"
14243,ANN WITHERS,"on fashionable manners: it was a pleasant amusement to me, a sort of"
14244,ANN WITHERS,keeping up the memory of past times. But now the music was always
14245,ANN WITHERS,"in the way. The last time it was talked of, lady Harriot said her"
14246,ANN WITHERS,daughter's time was too precious to be taken up with such trifling.
14247,ANN WITHERS,
14248,ANN WITHERS,I must own that the music had that effect on miss Lesley as to render
14249,ANN WITHERS,"these lectures less necessary, which I will explain to you; but,"
14250,ANN WITHERS,"first, let me assure you that lady Harriot was by no means in the"
14251,ANN WITHERS,habit of saying these kind of things. It was almost a solitary
14252,ANN WITHERS,instance. I could give you a thousand instances the very reverse of
14253,ANN WITHERS,"this, in her as well as in sir Edward. How kindly, how frequently,"
14254,ANN WITHERS,"would they remind me, that to me alone it was owing that they ever"
14255,ANN WITHERS,knew their child! calling the day on which I was a petitioner for
14256,ANN WITHERS,"the admittance of Ann into the house, the blessed birthday of their"
14257,ANN WITHERS,generous girl.
14258,ANN WITHERS,
14259,ANN WITHERS,"Neither dancing, nor any foolish lectures could do much for miss"
14260,ANN WITHERS,"Lesley, she remained wanting in gracefulness of carriage; but all that"
14261,ANN WITHERS,"is usually attributed to dancing, music effected. When she was sitting"
14262,ANN WITHERS,"before the instrument, a resemblance to her mother became apparent to"
14263,ANN WITHERS,every eye. Her attitudes and the expression of her countenance were
14264,ANN WITHERS,the very same. This soon followed her into every thing; all was
14265,ANN WITHERS,"ease and natural grace; for the music, and with it the idea of lady"
14266,ANN WITHERS,"Harriot, was always in her thoughts. It was a pretty sight to see the"
14267,ANN WITHERS,"daily improvement in her person, even to me, poor envious girl that I"
14268,ANN WITHERS,was.
14269,ANN WITHERS,
14270,ANN WITHERS,Soon after lady Harriot had hurt me by calling my little efforts to
14271,ANN WITHERS,"improve her daughter trifling, she made me large amends in a very kind"
14272,ANN WITHERS,and most unreserved conversation that she held with me.
14273,ANN WITHERS,
14274,ANN WITHERS,She told me all the struggles she had had at first to feel a maternal
14275,ANN WITHERS,tenderness for her daughter; and she frankly confessed that she had
14276,ANN WITHERS,"now gained so much on her affections, that she feared she had too much"
14277,ANN WITHERS,"neglected the solemn promise she had made me, _Never to forget how"
14278,ANN WITHERS,long she had loved me as her child._
14279,ANN WITHERS,
14280,ANN WITHERS,"Encouraged by her returning kindness, I owned how much I had suffered,"
14281,ANN WITHERS,"and ventured to express my fears, that I had hardly courage enough to"
14282,ANN WITHERS,"bear the sight of my former friends, under a new designation, as I"
14283,ANN WITHERS,"must now appear to them, on our removal to London, which was expected"
14284,ANN WITHERS,to take place in a short time.
14285,ANN WITHERS,
14286,ANN WITHERS,"A few days after this she told me in the gentlest manner possible,"
14287,ANN WITHERS,that sir Edward and herself were of opinion it would conduce to my
14288,ANN WITHERS,happiness to pass a year or two at school.
14289,ANN WITHERS,
14290,ANN WITHERS,I knew that this proposal was kindly intended to spare me the
14291,ANN WITHERS,mortifications I so much dreaded; therefore I endeavoured to submit
14292,ANN WITHERS,"to my hard fate with cheerfulness, and prepared myself, not without"
14293,ANN WITHERS,"reluctance, to quit a mansion which had been the scene of so many"
14294,ANN WITHERS,"enjoyments, and latterly of such very different feelings."

14303,ELINOR FORESTER,(_By Mary Lamb_)
14304,ELINOR FORESTER,
14305,ELINOR FORESTER,
14306,ELINOR FORESTER,"When I was very young, I had the misfortune to lose my mother. My"
14307,ELINOR FORESTER,father very soon married again. In the morning of the day in which
14308,ELINOR FORESTER,"that event took place, my father set me on his knee, and, as he often"
14309,ELINOR FORESTER,"used to do after the death of my mother, he called me his dear little"
14310,ELINOR FORESTER,"orphaned Elinor, and then he asked me if I loved miss Saville. I"
14311,ELINOR FORESTER,"replied ""Yes."" Then he said this dear lady was going to be so kind"
14312,ELINOR FORESTER,"as to be married to him, and that she was to live with us, and be my"
14313,ELINOR FORESTER,"mamma. My father told me this with such pleasure in his looks, that I"
14314,ELINOR FORESTER,thought it must be a very fine thing indeed to have a new mamma; and
14315,ELINOR FORESTER,on his saying it was time for me to be dressed against his return from
14316,ELINOR FORESTER,"church, I ran in great spirits to tell the good news in the nursery."
14317,ELINOR FORESTER,I found my maid and the house-maid looking out of the window to see
14318,ELINOR FORESTER,"my father get into his carriage, which was new painted; the servants"
14319,ELINOR FORESTER,"had new liveries, and fine white ribbands in their hats; and then I"
14320,ELINOR FORESTER,perceived my father had left off his mourning. The maids were dressed
14321,ELINOR FORESTER,in new coloured gowns and white ribbands. On the table I saw a new
14322,ELINOR FORESTER,"muslin frock, trimmed with fine lace ready for me to put on. I skipped"
14323,ELINOR FORESTER,about the room quite in an ecstasy.
14324,ELINOR FORESTER,
14325,ELINOR FORESTER,"When the carriage drove from the door, the housekeeper came in to"
14326,ELINOR FORESTER,bring the maids new white gloves. I repeated to her the words I had
14327,ELINOR FORESTER,"just heard, that that dear lady miss Saville was going to be married"
14328,ELINOR FORESTER,"to papa, and that she was to live with us, and be my mamma."
14329,ELINOR FORESTER,
14330,ELINOR FORESTER,"The housekeeper shook her head, and said, ""Poor thing! how soon"
14331,ELINOR FORESTER,"children forget every thing!"""
14332,ELINOR FORESTER,
14333,ELINOR FORESTER,"I could not imagine what she meant by my forgetting every thing, for"
14334,ELINOR FORESTER,I instantly recollected poor mamma used to say I had an excellent
14335,ELINOR FORESTER,memory.
14336,ELINOR FORESTER,
14337,ELINOR FORESTER,"The women began to draw on their white gloves, and the seams rending"
14338,ELINOR FORESTER,"in several places, Anne said, ""This is just the way our gloves served"
14339,ELINOR FORESTER,"us at my mistress's funeral."" The other checked her, and said ""Hush!"""
14340,ELINOR FORESTER,I was then thinking of some instances in which my mamma had praised my
14341,ELINOR FORESTER,"memory, and this reference to her funeral fixed her idea in my mind."
14342,ELINOR FORESTER,
14343,ELINOR FORESTER,"From the time of her death no one had ever spoken to me of my mamma,"
14344,ELINOR FORESTER,and I had apparently forgotten her; yet I had a habit which perhaps
14345,ELINOR FORESTER,"had not been observed, of taking my little stool, which had been my"
14346,ELINOR FORESTER,"mamma's footstool, and a doll, which my mamma had drest for me, while"
14347,ELINOR FORESTER,"she was sitting in her elbow-chair, her head supported with pillows."
14348,ELINOR FORESTER,"With these in my hands, I used to go to the door of the room in which"
14349,ELINOR FORESTER,"I had seen her in her last illness; and after trying to open it, and"
14350,ELINOR FORESTER,"peeping through the keyhole, from whence I could just see a glimpse of"
14351,ELINOR FORESTER,"the crimson curtains, I used to sit down on the stool before the door,"
14352,ELINOR FORESTER,"and play with my doll, and sometimes sing to it mamma's pretty song,"
14353,ELINOR FORESTER,"of ""Balow my babe;"" imitating as well as I could, the weak voice in"
14354,ELINOR FORESTER,which she used to sing it to me. My mamma had a very sweet voice. I
14355,ELINOR FORESTER,remember now the gentle tone in which she used to say my prattle did
14356,ELINOR FORESTER,not disturb her.
14357,ELINOR FORESTER,
14358,ELINOR FORESTER,"When I was drest in my new frock, I wished poor mamma was alive to"
14359,ELINOR FORESTER,"see how fine I was on papa's wedding-day, and I ran to my favourite"
14360,ELINOR FORESTER,"station at her bed-room door. There I sat thinking of my mamma, and"
14361,ELINOR FORESTER,trying to remember exactly how she used to look; because I foolishly
14362,ELINOR FORESTER,imagined that miss Saville was to be changed into something like my
14363,ELINOR FORESTER,"own mother, whose pale and delicate appearance in her last illness was"
14364,ELINOR FORESTER,all that I retained of her remembrance.
14365,ELINOR FORESTER,
14366,ELINOR FORESTER,"When my father returned home with his bride, he walked up stairs"
14367,ELINOR FORESTER,"to look for me, and my new mamma followed him. They found me at my"
14368,ELINOR FORESTER,"mother's door, earnestly looking through the keyhole; I was thinking"
14369,ELINOR FORESTER,"so intently on my mother, that when my father said, ""Here is your new"
14370,ELINOR FORESTER,"mamma, my Elinor,"" I turned round, and began to cry, for no other"
14371,ELINOR FORESTER,"reason than because she had a very high colour, and I remembered my"
14372,ELINOR FORESTER,"mamma was very pale; she had bright black eyes, my mother's were"
14373,ELINOR FORESTER,mild blue eyes; and that instead of the wrapping gown and close cap
14374,ELINOR FORESTER,"in which I remembered my mamma, she was drest in all her bridal"
14375,ELINOR FORESTER,decorations.
14376,ELINOR FORESTER,
14377,ELINOR FORESTER,"I said, ""Miss Saville shall not be my mamma,"" and I cried till I was"
14378,ELINOR FORESTER,sent away in disgrace.
14379,ELINOR FORESTER,
14380,ELINOR FORESTER,"Every time I saw her for several days, the same notion came into my"
14381,ELINOR FORESTER,"head, that she was not a bit more like mamma than when she was miss"
14382,ELINOR FORESTER,Saville. My father was very angry when he saw how shy I continued to
14383,ELINOR FORESTER,"look at her; but she always said, ""Never mind. Elinor and I shall soon"
14384,ELINOR FORESTER,"be better friends."""
14385,ELINOR FORESTER,
14386,ELINOR FORESTER,"One day, when I was very naughty indeed, for I would not speak one"
14387,ELINOR FORESTER,"word to either of them, my papa took his hat, and walked out quite in"
14388,ELINOR FORESTER,"a passion. When he was gone, I looked up at my new mamma, expecting"
14389,ELINOR FORESTER,to see her very angry too; but she was smiling and looking very
14390,ELINOR FORESTER,"good-naturedly upon me; and she said, ""Now we are alone together, my"
14391,ELINOR FORESTER,"pretty little daughter, let us forget papa is angry with us; and tell"
14392,ELINOR FORESTER,me why you were peeping through that door the day your papa brought
14393,ELINOR FORESTER,"me home, and you cried so at the sight of me."" ""Because mamma used to"
14394,ELINOR FORESTER,"be there,"" I replied. When she heard me say this, she fell a-crying"
14395,ELINOR FORESTER,"very sadly indeed; and I was so very sorry to hear her cry so, that I"
14396,ELINOR FORESTER,"forgot I did not love her, and I went up to her, and said, ""Don't cry,"
14397,ELINOR FORESTER,"I won't be naughty any more, I won't peep through the door any more."""
14398,ELINOR FORESTER,
14399,ELINOR FORESTER,"Then she said I had a little kind heart, and I should not have any"
14400,ELINOR FORESTER,"occasion, for she would take me into the room herself; and she rung"
14401,ELINOR FORESTER,"the bell, and ordered the key of that room to be brought to her; and"
14402,ELINOR FORESTER,"the housekeeper brought it, and tried to persuade her not to go. But"
14403,ELINOR FORESTER,"she said, ""I must have my own way in this;"" and she carried me in her"
14404,ELINOR FORESTER,arms into my mother's room.
14405,ELINOR FORESTER,
14406,ELINOR FORESTER,O I was so pleased to be taken into mamma's room! I pointed out to her
14407,ELINOR FORESTER,all the things that I remembered to have belonged to mamma and she
14408,ELINOR FORESTER,encouraged me to tell her all the little incidents which had dwelt on
14409,ELINOR FORESTER,"my memory concerning her. She told me, that she went to school with"
14410,ELINOR FORESTER,"mamma when she was a little girl, and that I should come into this"
14411,ELINOR FORESTER,"room with her every day when papa was gone out, and she would tell me"
14412,ELINOR FORESTER,stories of mamma when she was a little girl no bigger than me.
14413,ELINOR FORESTER,
14414,ELINOR FORESTER,"When my father came home, we were walking in a garden at the back of"
14415,ELINOR FORESTER,"our house, and I was shewing her mamma's geraniums, and telling her"
14416,ELINOR FORESTER,what pretty flowers they had when mamma was alive.
14417,ELINOR FORESTER,
14418,ELINOR FORESTER,"My father was astonished; and he said, ""Is this the sullen Elinor?"
14419,ELINOR FORESTER,"what has worked this miracle?"" ""Ask no questions,"" she replied, ""or"
14420,ELINOR FORESTER,you will disturb our new-born friendship. Elinor has promised to love
14421,ELINOR FORESTER,"me, and she says too that she will call me 'mamma.'"" ""Yes, I will,"
14422,ELINOR FORESTER,"mamma, mamma, mamma,"" I replied, and hung about her with the greatest"
14423,ELINOR FORESTER,fondness.
14424,ELINOR FORESTER,
14425,ELINOR FORESTER,After this she used to pass great part of the mornings with me in my
14426,ELINOR FORESTER,"mother's room, which was now made the repository of all my playthings,"
14427,ELINOR FORESTER,and also my school-room. Here my new mamma taught me to read. I was a
14428,ELINOR FORESTER,"sad little dunce, and scarcely knew my letters; my own mamma had often"
14429,ELINOR FORESTER,"said, when she got better she would hear me read every day, but as she"
14430,ELINOR FORESTER,"never got better it was not her fault. I now began to learn very fast,"
14431,ELINOR FORESTER,"for when I said my lesson well, I was always rewarded with some pretty"
14432,ELINOR FORESTER,story of my mother's childhood; and these stories generally contained
14433,ELINOR FORESTER,"some little hints that were instructive to me, and which I greatly"
14434,ELINOR FORESTER,"stood in want of; for, between improper indulgence and neglect, I had"
14435,ELINOR FORESTER,many faulty ways.
14436,ELINOR FORESTER,
14437,ELINOR FORESTER,"In this kind manner my mother-in-law has instructed and improved me,"
14438,ELINOR FORESTER,and I love her because she was my mother's friend when they were
14439,ELINOR FORESTER,"young. She has been my only instructress, for I never went to school"
14440,ELINOR FORESTER,"till I came here. She would have continued to teach me, but she has"
14441,ELINOR FORESTER,"not time, for she has a little baby of her own now, and that is the"
14442,ELINOR FORESTER,reason I came to school.

14451,MARGARET GREEN,(_By Mary Lamb_)
14452,MARGARET GREEN,
14453,MARGARET GREEN,
14454,MARGARET GREEN,"My father has been dead near three years. Soon after his death, my"
14455,MARGARET GREEN,"mother being left in reduced circumstances, she was induced to accept"
14456,MARGARET GREEN,"the offer of Mrs. Beresford, an elderly lady of large fortune, to live"
14457,MARGARET GREEN,"in her house as her companion, and the superintendent of her family."
14458,MARGARET GREEN,"This lady was my godmother, and as I was my mother's only child, she"
14459,MARGARET GREEN,very kindly permitted her to have me with her.
14460,MARGARET GREEN,
14461,MARGARET GREEN,Mrs. Beresford lived in a large old family mansion; she kept no
14462,MARGARET GREEN,"company, and never moved except from the breakfast-parlour to the"
14463,MARGARET GREEN,"eating-room, and from thence to the drawing-room to tea."
14464,MARGARET GREEN,
14465,MARGARET GREEN,"Every morning when she first saw me, she used to nod her head very"
14466,MARGARET GREEN,"kindly, and say, ""How do you do, little Margaret?"" But I do not"
14467,MARGARET GREEN,recollect she ever spoke to me during the remainder of the day; except
14468,MARGARET GREEN,"indeed after I had read the psalms and the chapters, which was my"
14469,MARGARET GREEN,"daily task; then she used constantly to observe, that I improved in"
14470,MARGARET GREEN,"my reading, and frequently added, ""I never heard a child read so"
14471,MARGARET GREEN,"distinctly."" She had been remarkably fond of needle-work, and her"
14472,MARGARET GREEN,conversation with my mother was generally the history of some pieces
14473,MARGARET GREEN,"of work she had formerly done; the dates when they were begun, and"
14474,MARGARET GREEN,"when finished; what had retarded their progress, and what had hastened"
14475,MARGARET GREEN,"their completion. If occasionally any other events were spoken of, she"
14476,MARGARET GREEN,"had no other chronology to reckon by, than in the recollection of what"
14477,MARGARET GREEN,"carpet, what sofa-cover, what set of chairs, were in the frame at that"
14478,MARGARET GREEN,time.
14479,MARGARET GREEN,
14480,MARGARET GREEN,I believe my mother is not particularly fond of needle-work; for in
14481,MARGARET GREEN,"my father's lifetime I never saw her amuse herself in this way; yet,"
14482,MARGARET GREEN,"to oblige her kind patroness, she undertook to finish a large carpet,"
14483,MARGARET GREEN,which the old lady had just begun when her eye-sight failed her. All
14484,MARGARET GREEN,"day long my mother used to sit at the frame, talking of the shades of"
14485,MARGARET GREEN,"the worsted, and the beauty of the colours;--Mrs. Beresford seated in"
14486,MARGARET GREEN,"a chair near her, and, though her eyes were so dim she could hardly"
14487,MARGARET GREEN,"distinguish one colour from another, watching through her spectacles"
14488,MARGARET GREEN,the progress of the work.
14489,MARGARET GREEN,
14490,MARGARET GREEN,"When my daily portion of reading was over, I had a task of"
14491,MARGARET GREEN,"needle-work, which generally lasted half an hour. I was not allowed to"
14492,MARGARET GREEN,"pass more time in reading or work, because my eyes were very weak, for"
14493,MARGARET GREEN,which reason I was always set to read in the large-print Family Bible.
14494,MARGARET GREEN,I was very fond of reading; and when I could unobserved steal a few
14495,MARGARET GREEN,"minutes as they were intent on their work, I used to delight to read"
14496,MARGARET GREEN,"in the historical part of the Bible; but this, because of my eyes, was"
14497,MARGARET GREEN,a forbidden pleasure; and the Bible never being removed out of the
14498,MARGARET GREEN,"room, it was only for a short time together that I dared softly to"
14499,MARGARET GREEN,lift up the leaves and peep into it.
14500,MARGARET GREEN,
14501,MARGARET GREEN,As I was permitted to walk in the garden or wander about the house
14502,MARGARET GREEN,"whenever I pleased, I used to leave the parlour for hours together,"
14503,MARGARET GREEN,and make out my own solitary amusement as well as I could. My first
14504,MARGARET GREEN,"visit was always to a very large hall, which, from being paved"
14505,MARGARET GREEN,"with marble, was called the marble hall. In this hall, while Mrs."
14506,MARGARET GREEN,"Beresford's husband was living, the tenants used to be feasted at"
14507,MARGARET GREEN,Christmas.
14508,MARGARET GREEN,
14509,MARGARET GREEN,The heads of the twelve Cæsars were hung round the hall. Every day I
14510,MARGARET GREEN,"mounted on the chairs to look at them, and to read the inscriptions"
14511,MARGARET GREEN,"underneath, till I became perfectly familiar with their names and"
14512,MARGARET GREEN,features.
14513,MARGARET GREEN,
14514,MARGARET GREEN,Hogarth's prints were below the Cæsars: I was very fond of looking at
14515,MARGARET GREEN,"them, and endeavouring to make out their meaning."
14516,MARGARET GREEN,
14517,MARGARET GREEN,"An old broken battledore, and some shuttlecocks with most of the"
14518,MARGARET GREEN,"feathers missing, were on a marble slab in one corner of the hall,"
14519,MARGARET GREEN,which constantly reminded me that there had once been younger
14520,MARGARET GREEN,inhabitants here than the old lady and her gray-headed servants. In
14521,MARGARET GREEN,another corner stood a marble figure of a satyr: every day I laid my
14522,MARGARET GREEN,hand on his shoulder to feel how cold he was.
14523,MARGARET GREEN,
14524,MARGARET GREEN,This hall opened into a room full of family portraits. They were all
14525,MARGARET GREEN,"in the dresses of former times: some were old men and women, and some"
14526,MARGARET GREEN,were children. I used to long to have a fairy's power to call the
14527,MARGARET GREEN,children down from their frames to play with me. One little girl in
14528,MARGARET GREEN,"particular, who hung by the side of a glass door which opened into the"
14529,MARGARET GREEN,"garden, I often invited to walk there with me, but she still kept her"
14530,MARGARET GREEN,"station--one arm round a little lamb's neck, and in her hand a large"
14531,MARGARET GREEN,bunch of roses.
14532,MARGARET GREEN,
14533,MARGARET GREEN,From this room I usually proceeded to the garden.
14534,MARGARET GREEN,
14535,MARGARET GREEN,When I was weary of the garden I wandered over the rest of the house.
14536,MARGARET GREEN,The best suite of rooms I never saw by any other light than what
14537,MARGARET GREEN,"glimmered through the tops of the window-shutters, which however"
14538,MARGARET GREEN,"served to shew the carved chimney-pieces, and the curious old"
14539,MARGARET GREEN,"ornaments about the rooms; but the worked furniture and carpets, of"
14540,MARGARET GREEN,"which I heard such constant praises, I could have but an imperfect"
14541,MARGARET GREEN,"sight of, peeping under the covers which were kept over them, by the"
14542,MARGARET GREEN,"dim light; for I constantly lifted up a corner of the envious cloth,"
14543,MARGARET GREEN,that hid these highly-praised rarities from my view.
14544,MARGARET GREEN,
14545,MARGARET GREEN,"The bed-rooms were also regularly explored by me, as well to admire"
14546,MARGARET GREEN,"the antique furniture, as for the sake of contemplating the tapestry"
14547,MARGARET GREEN,"hangings, which were full of Bible history. The subject of the one"
14548,MARGARET GREEN,"which chiefly attracted my attention, was Hagar and her son Ishmael."
14549,MARGARET GREEN,"Every day I admired the beauty of the youth, and pitied the forlorn"
14550,MARGARET GREEN,state of him and his mother in the wilderness. At the end of the
14551,MARGARET GREEN,"gallery into which these tapestry rooms opened, was one door, which"
14552,MARGARET GREEN,"having often in vain attempted to open, I concluded to be locked;"
14553,MARGARET GREEN,"and finding myself shut out, I was very desirous of seeing what"
14554,MARGARET GREEN,"it contained; and though still foiled in the attempt, I every day"
14555,MARGARET GREEN,"endeavoured to turn the lock, which whether by constantly trying I"
14556,MARGARET GREEN,"loosened, being probably a very old one, or that the door was not"
14557,MARGARET GREEN,"locked but fastened tight by time, I know not,--to my great joy, as I"
14558,MARGARET GREEN,"was one day trying the lock as usual, it gave way, and I found myself"
14559,MARGARET GREEN,in this so long desired room.
14560,MARGARET GREEN,
14561,MARGARET GREEN,It proved to be a very large library. This was indeed a precious
14562,MARGARET GREEN,discovery. I looked round on the books with the greatest delight. I
14563,MARGARET GREEN,thought I would read them every one. I now forsook all my favourite
14564,MARGARET GREEN,"haunts, and passed all my time here. I took down first one book, then"
14565,MARGARET GREEN,another.
14566,MARGARET GREEN,
14567,MARGARET GREEN,"If you never spent whole mornings alone in a large library, you cannot"
14568,MARGARET GREEN,conceive the pleasure of taking down books in the constant hope
14569,MARGARET GREEN,"of finding an entertaining book among them; yet, after many days,"
14570,MARGARET GREEN,"meeting with nothing but disappointment, it becomes less pleasant. All"
14571,MARGARET GREEN,the books within my reach were folios of the gravest cast. I could
14572,MARGARET GREEN,"understand very little that I read in them, and the old dark print and"
14573,MARGARET GREEN,the length of the lines made my eyes ache.
14574,MARGARET GREEN,
14575,MARGARET GREEN,"When I had almost resolved to give up the search as fruitless, I"
14576,MARGARET GREEN,perceived a volume lying in an obscure corner of the room. I opened
14577,MARGARET GREEN,it. It was a charming print; the letters were almost as large as the
14578,MARGARET GREEN,type of the Family Bible. In the first page I looked into I saw the
14579,MARGARET GREEN,"name of my favourite Ishmael, whose face I knew so well from the"
14580,MARGARET GREEN,"tapestry, and whose history I had often read in the Bible."
14581,MARGARET GREEN,
14582,MARGARET GREEN,I sate myself down to read this book with the greatest eagerness. The
14583,MARGARET GREEN,"title of it was ""Mahometism Explained."" It was a very improper book,"
14584,MARGARET GREEN,for it contained a false history of Abraham and his descendants.
14585,MARGARET GREEN,
14586,MARGARET GREEN,I shall be quite ashamed to tell you the strange effect it had on me.
14587,MARGARET GREEN,I know it was very wrong to read any book without permission to do so.
14588,MARGARET GREEN,"If my time were to come over again, I would go and tell my mamma that"
14589,MARGARET GREEN,"there was a library in the house, and ask her to permit me to read a"
14590,MARGARET GREEN,little while every day in some book that she might think proper to
14591,MARGARET GREEN,select for me. But unfortunately I did not then recollect that I ought
14592,MARGARET GREEN,to do this: the reason of my strange forgetfulness might be that my
14593,MARGARET GREEN,"mother, following the example of her patroness, had almost wholly"
14594,MARGARET GREEN,discontinued talking to me. I scarcely ever heard a word addressed to
14595,MARGARET GREEN,me from morning to night. If it were not for the old servants saying
14596,MARGARET GREEN,"""Good morning to you, miss Margaret,"" as they passed me in the long"
14597,MARGARET GREEN,"passages, I should have been the greatest part of the day in as"
14598,MARGARET GREEN,perfect a solitude as Robinson Crusoe. It must have been because I
14599,MARGARET GREEN,"was never spoken to at all, that I forgot what was right and what was"
14600,MARGARET GREEN,"wrong, for I do not believe that I ever remembered I was doing wrong"
14601,MARGARET GREEN,all the time I was reading in the library. A great many of the leaves
14602,MARGARET GREEN,"in ""Mahometism Explained"" were torn out, but enough remained to make"
14603,MARGARET GREEN,me imagine that Ishmael was the true son of Abraham: I read here that
14604,MARGARET GREEN,the true descendants of Abraham were known by a light which streamed
14605,MARGARET GREEN,"from the middle of their foreheads. It said, that Ishmael's father and"
14606,MARGARET GREEN,"mother first saw this light streaming from his forehead, as he was"
14607,MARGARET GREEN,lying asleep in the cradle. I was very sorry so many of the leaves
14608,MARGARET GREEN,"were torn out, for it was as entertaining as a fairy tale. I used"
14609,MARGARET GREEN,"to read the history of Ishmael, and then go and look at him in the"
14610,MARGARET GREEN,"tapestry, and then read his history again. When I had almost learned"
14611,MARGARET GREEN,"the history of Ishmael by heart, I read the rest of the book, and then"
14612,MARGARET GREEN,"I came to the history of Mahomet, who was there said to be the last"
14613,MARGARET GREEN,descendant of Abraham.
14614,MARGARET GREEN,
14615,MARGARET GREEN,"If Ishmael had engaged so much of my thoughts, how much more so"
14616,MARGARET GREEN,must Mahomet? His history was full of nothing but wonders from the
14617,MARGARET GREEN,"beginning to the end. The book said, that those who believed all"
14618,MARGARET GREEN,the wonderful stories which were related of Mahomet were called
14619,MARGARET GREEN,"Mahometans, and true believers:--I concluded that I must be a"
14620,MARGARET GREEN,"Mahometan, for I believed every word I read."
14621,MARGARET GREEN,
14622,MARGARET GREEN,"At length I met with something which I also believed, though I"
14623,MARGARET GREEN,"trembled as I read it:--this was, that after we are dead, we are to"
14624,MARGARET GREEN,"pass over a narrow bridge, which crosses a bottomless gulf. The bridge"
14625,MARGARET GREEN,"was described to be no wider than a silken thread; and it said, that"
14626,MARGARET GREEN,"all who were not Mahometans would slip on one side of this bridge, and"
14627,MARGARET GREEN,drop into the tremendous gulf that had no bottom. I considered myself
14628,MARGARET GREEN,"as a Mahometan, yet I was perfectly giddy whenever I thought of"
14629,MARGARET GREEN,passing over this bridge.
14630,MARGARET GREEN,
14631,MARGARET GREEN,"One day, seeing the old lady totter across the room, a sudden terror"
14632,MARGARET GREEN,"seized me, for I thought, how would she ever be able to get over the"
14633,MARGARET GREEN,"bridge. Then too it was, that I first recollected that my mother would"
14634,MARGARET GREEN,also be in imminent danger; for I imagined she had never heard the
14635,MARGARET GREEN,"name of Mahomet, because I foolishly conjectured this book had been"
14636,MARGARET GREEN,"locked up for ages in the library, and was utterly unknown to the rest"
14637,MARGARET GREEN,of the world.
14638,MARGARET GREEN,
14639,MARGARET GREEN,All my desire was now to tell them the discovery I had made; for I
14640,MARGARET GREEN,"thought, when they knew of the existence of ""Mahometism Explained,"""
14641,MARGARET GREEN,"they would read it, and become Mahometans, to ensure themselves a"
14642,MARGARET GREEN,safe passage over the silken bridge. But it wanted more courage than
14643,MARGARET GREEN,"I possessed, to break the matter to my intended converts; I must"
14644,MARGARET GREEN,acknowledge that I had been reading without leave; and the habit
14645,MARGARET GREEN,"of never speaking, or being spoken to, considerably increased the"
14646,MARGARET GREEN,difficulty.
14647,MARGARET GREEN,
14648,MARGARET GREEN,"My anxiety on this subject threw me into a fever. I was so ill, that"
14649,MARGARET GREEN,my mother thought it necessary to sleep in the same room with me. In
14650,MARGARET GREEN,the middle of the night I could not resist the strong desire I felt to
14651,MARGARET GREEN,tell her what preyed so much on my mind.
14652,MARGARET GREEN,
14653,MARGARET GREEN,"I awoke her out of a sound sleep, and begged she would be so kind as"
14654,MARGARET GREEN,"to be a Mahometan. She was very much alarmed, for she thought I was"
14655,MARGARET GREEN,"delirious, which I believe I was; for I tried to explain the reason of"
14656,MARGARET GREEN,"my request, but it was in such an incoherent manner that she could not"
14657,MARGARET GREEN,at all comprehend what I was talking about.
14658,MARGARET GREEN,
14659,MARGARET GREEN,"The next day a physician was sent for, and he discovered, by several"
14660,MARGARET GREEN,"questions that he put to me, that I had read myself into a fever. He"
14661,MARGARET GREEN,"gave me medicines, and ordered me to be kept very quiet, and said, he"
14662,MARGARET GREEN,hoped in a few days I should be very well; but as it was a new case
14663,MARGARET GREEN,"to him, he never having attended a little Mahometan before, if any"
14664,MARGARET GREEN,"lowness continued after he had removed the fever, he would, with my"
14665,MARGARET GREEN,"mother's permission, take me home with him to study this extraordinary"
14666,MARGARET GREEN,"case at his leisure; and added, that he could then hold a consultation"
14667,MARGARET GREEN,"with his wife, who was often very useful to him in prescribing"
14668,MARGARET GREEN,remedies for the maladies of his younger patients.
14669,MARGARET GREEN,
14670,MARGARET GREEN,In a few days he fetched me away. His wife was in the carriage with
14671,MARGARET GREEN,"him. Having heard what he said about her prescriptions, I expected,"
14672,MARGARET GREEN,"between the doctor and his lady, to undergo a severe course of"
14673,MARGARET GREEN,"medicine, especially as I heard him very formally ask her advice what"
14674,MARGARET GREEN,"was good for a Mahometan fever, the moment after he had handed me into"
14675,MARGARET GREEN,"the carriage. She studied a little while, and then she said, A ride"
14676,MARGARET GREEN,to Harlow fair would not be amiss. He said he was entirely of her
14677,MARGARET GREEN,"opinion, because it suited him to go there to buy a horse."
14678,MARGARET GREEN,
14679,MARGARET GREEN,"During the ride they entered into conversation with me, and in answer"
14680,MARGARET GREEN,"to their questions, I was relating to them the solitary manner in"
14681,MARGARET GREEN,"which I had passed my time; how I found out the library, and what I"
14682,MARGARET GREEN,"had read in the fatal book which had so heated my imagination,--when"
14683,MARGARET GREEN,"we arrived at the fair; and Ishmael, Mahomet, and the narrow bridge,"
14684,MARGARET GREEN,vanished out of my head in an instant.
14685,MARGARET GREEN,
14686,MARGARET GREEN,"O what a cheerful sight it was to me, to see so many happy faces"
14687,MARGARET GREEN,"assembled together, walking up and down between the rows of booths"
14688,MARGARET GREEN,"that were full of showy things; ribbands, laces, toys, cakes, and"
14689,MARGARET GREEN,"sweetmeats! While the doctor was gone to buy his horse, his kind"
14690,MARGARET GREEN,"lady let me stand as long as I pleased at the booths, and gave me"
14691,MARGARET GREEN,"many things which she saw I particularly admired. My needle-case, my"
14692,MARGARET GREEN,"pin-cushion, indeed my work-basket, and all its contents, are presents"
14693,MARGARET GREEN,"which she purchased for me at this fair. After we returned home, she"
14694,MARGARET GREEN,"played with me all the evening at a geographical game, which she also"
14695,MARGARET GREEN,bought for me at this cheerful fair.
14696,MARGARET GREEN,
14697,MARGARET GREEN,"The next day she invited some young ladies of my own age, to spend the"
14698,MARGARET GREEN,"day with me. She had a swing put up in the garden for us, and a room"
14699,MARGARET GREEN,cleared of the furniture that we might play at blindman's-buff. One of
14700,MARGARET GREEN,"the liveliest of the girls, who had taken on herself the direction of"
14701,MARGARET GREEN,"our sports, she kept to be my companion all the time I staid with her,"
14702,MARGARET GREEN,and every day contrived some new amusement for us.
14703,MARGARET GREEN,
14704,MARGARET GREEN,Yet this good lady did not suffer all my time to pass in mirth and
14705,MARGARET GREEN,"gaiety. Before I went home, she explained to me very seriously the"
14706,MARGARET GREEN,"error into which I had fallen. I found that so far from ""Mahometism"
14707,MARGARET GREEN,"Explained"" being a book concealed only in this library, it was well"
14708,MARGARET GREEN,known to every person of the least information.
14709,MARGARET GREEN,
14710,MARGARET GREEN,"The Turks, she told me, were Mahometans, and that, if the leaves of"
14711,MARGARET GREEN,"my favourite book had not been torn out, I should have read that the"
14712,MARGARET GREEN,author of it did not mean to give the fabulous stories here related as
14713,MARGARET GREEN,"true, but only wrote it as giving a history of what the Turks, who are"
14714,MARGARET GREEN,"a very ignorant people, believe concerning the impostor Mahomet, who"
14715,MARGARET GREEN,feigned himself to be a descendant of Ishmael. By the good offices of
14716,MARGARET GREEN,"the physician and his lady, I was carried home at the end of a month,"
14717,MARGARET GREEN,"perfectly cured of the error into which I had fallen, and very much"
14718,MARGARET GREEN,ashamed of having believed so many absurdities.

14725,EMILY BARTON,EMILY BARTON
14726,EMILY BARTON,
14727,EMILY BARTON,(_By Mary Lamb_)
14728,EMILY BARTON,
14729,EMILY BARTON,
14730,EMILY BARTON,"When I was a very young child, I remember residing with an uncle"
14731,EMILY BARTON,and aunt who lived in ----shire. I think I remained there near a
14732,EMILY BARTON,twelvemonth. I am ignorant of the cause of my being so long left there
14733,EMILY BARTON,"by my parents, who, though they were remarkably fond of me, never came"
14734,EMILY BARTON,to see me during all that time. As I did not know I should ever have
14735,EMILY BARTON,"occasion to relate the occurrences of my life, I never thought of"
14736,EMILY BARTON,enquiring the reason.
14737,EMILY BARTON,
14738,EMILY BARTON,"I am just able to recollect, that when I first went there, I thought"
14739,EMILY BARTON,"it was a fine thing to live in the country, and play with my little"
14740,EMILY BARTON,"cousins in the garden all day long; and I also recollect, that I soon"
14741,EMILY BARTON,"found that it was a very dull thing, to live in the country with"
14742,EMILY BARTON,"little cousins who have a papa and mamma in the house, while my own"
14743,EMILY BARTON,dear papa and mamma were in London many miles away.
14744,EMILY BARTON,
14745,EMILY BARTON,"I have heard my papa observe, girls who are not well managed are"
14746,EMILY BARTON,a most quarrelsome race of little people. My cousins very often
14747,EMILY BARTON,"quarrelled with me, and then they always said, ""I will go and tell my"
14748,EMILY BARTON,"mamma, cousin Emily;"" and then I used to be very disconsolate because"
14749,EMILY BARTON,I had no mamma to complain to of my grievances.
14750,EMILY BARTON,
14751,EMILY BARTON,My aunt always took Sophia's part because she was so young; and she
14752,EMILY BARTON,"never suffered me to oppose Mary, or Elizabeth, because they were"
14753,EMILY BARTON,older than me.
14754,EMILY BARTON,
14755,EMILY BARTON,The playthings were all the property of one or other of my cousins.
14756,EMILY BARTON,"The large dolls belonged to Mary and Elizabeth, and the pretty little"
14757,EMILY BARTON,"wax dolls were dressed on purpose for Sophia, who always began to cry"
14758,EMILY BARTON,the instant I touched them. I had nothing that I could call my own but
14759,EMILY BARTON,one pretty book of stories; and one day as Sophia was endeavouring
14760,EMILY BARTON,"to take it from me, and I was trying to keep it, it was all torn to"
14761,EMILY BARTON,"pieces; and my aunt would not be angry with her. She only said, Sophia"
14762,EMILY BARTON,was a little baby and did not know any better. My uncle promised to
14763,EMILY BARTON,"buy me another book, but he never remembered it. Very often when he"
14764,EMILY BARTON,"came home in the evening, he used to say, ""I wonder what I have got in"
14765,EMILY BARTON,"my pocket;"" and then they all crowded round him, and I used to creep"
14766,EMILY BARTON,"towards him, and think, May be it is my book that my uncle has got in"
14767,EMILY BARTON,"his pocket. But, no; nothing ever came out for me. Yet the first sight"
14768,EMILY BARTON,"of a plaything, even if it is not one's own, is always a cheerful"
14769,EMILY BARTON,"thing, and a new toy would put them in a good humour for a while, and"
14770,EMILY BARTON,"they would say, ""Here, Emily, look what I have got. You may take it in"
14771,EMILY BARTON,"your own hand and look at it."" But the pleasure of examining it, was"
14772,EMILY BARTON,"sure to be stopped in a short time by the old story of ""Give that to"
14773,EMILY BARTON,"me again; you know that is mine."" Nobody could help, I think, being a"
14774,EMILY BARTON,little out of humour if they were always served so: but if I shewed
14775,EMILY BARTON,"any signs of discontent, my aunt always told my uncle I was a little"
14776,EMILY BARTON,"peevish fretful thing, and gave her more trouble than all her own"
14777,EMILY BARTON,"children put together. My aunt would often say, what a happy thing"
14778,EMILY BARTON,"it was, to have such affectionate children as hers were. She was"
14779,EMILY BARTON,always praising my cousins because they were affectionate; that was
14780,EMILY BARTON,sure to be her word. She said I had not one atom of affection in my
14781,EMILY BARTON,"disposition, for that no kindness ever made the least impression on"
14782,EMILY BARTON,"me. And she would say all this with Sophia seated on her lap, and"
14783,EMILY BARTON,"the two eldest perhaps hanging round their papa, while I was so dull"
14784,EMILY BARTON,"to see them taken so much notice of, and so sorry that I was not"
14785,EMILY BARTON,"affectionate, that I did not know what to do with myself."
14786,EMILY BARTON,
14787,EMILY BARTON,Then there was another complaint against me; that I was so shy before
14788,EMILY BARTON,"strangers. Whenever any strangers spoke to me, before I had time to"
14789,EMILY BARTON,"think what answer I should give, Mary or Elizabeth would say, ""Emily"
14790,EMILY BARTON,"is so shy, she will never speak."" Then I, thinking I was very shy,"
14791,EMILY BARTON,"would creep into a corner of the room, and be ashamed to look up while"
14792,EMILY BARTON,the company staid.
14793,EMILY BARTON,
14794,EMILY BARTON,"Though I often thought of my papa and mamma, by degrees the"
14795,EMILY BARTON,remembrance of their persons faded out of my mind. When I tried to
14796,EMILY BARTON,"think how they used to look, the faces of my cousins' papa and mamma"
14797,EMILY BARTON,only came into my mind.
14798,EMILY BARTON,
14799,EMILY BARTON,"One morning, my uncle and aunt went abroad before breakfast, and"
14800,EMILY BARTON,took my cousins with them. They very often went out for whole days
14801,EMILY BARTON,"together, and left me at home. Sometimes they said it was because"
14802,EMILY BARTON,they could not take so many children; and sometimes they said it was
14803,EMILY BARTON,"because I was so shy, it was no amusement to me to go abroad."
14804,EMILY BARTON,
14805,EMILY BARTON,"That morning I was very solitary indeed, for they had even taken the"
14806,EMILY BARTON,"dog Sancho with them, and I was very fond of him. I went all about"
14807,EMILY BARTON,the house and garden to look for him. Nobody could tell me where
14808,EMILY BARTON,"Sancho was, and then I went into the front court and called, ""Sancho,"
14809,EMILY BARTON,"Sancho."" An old man that worked in the garden was there, and he said"
14810,EMILY BARTON,"Sancho was gone with his master. O how sorry I was! I began to cry,"
14811,EMILY BARTON,for Sancho and I used to amuse ourselves for hours together when every
14812,EMILY BARTON,"body was gone out. I cried till I heard the mail coachman's horn,"
14813,EMILY BARTON,and then I ran to the gate to see the mail-coach go past. It stopped
14814,EMILY BARTON,"before our gate, and a gentleman got out, and the moment he saw me"
14815,EMILY BARTON,"he took me in his arms, and kissed me, and said I was Emily Barton,"
14816,EMILY BARTON,and asked me why the tears were on my little pale cheeks; and I told
14817,EMILY BARTON,him the cause of my distress. The old man asked him to walk into the
14818,EMILY BARTON,"house, and was going to call one of the servants; but the gentleman"
14819,EMILY BARTON,"would not let him, and he said, ""Go on with your work, I want"
14820,EMILY BARTON,"to talk to this little girl before I go into the house."" Then he"
14821,EMILY BARTON,"sate down on a bench which was in the court, and asked me many"
14822,EMILY BARTON,"questions; and I told him all my little troubles, for he was such a"
14823,EMILY BARTON,good-natured-looking gentleman that I prattled very freely to him. I
14824,EMILY BARTON,"told him all I have told you, and more, for the unkind treatment I met"
14825,EMILY BARTON,with was more fresh in my mind than it is now. Then he called to the
14826,EMILY BARTON,"old man and desired him to fetch a post-chaise, and gave him money"
14827,EMILY BARTON,"that he should make haste, and I never saw the old man walk so fast"
14828,EMILY BARTON,"before. When he had been gone a little while, the gentleman said,"
14829,EMILY BARTON,"""Will you walk with me down the road to meet the chaise, and you shall"
14830,EMILY BARTON,"ride in it a little way along with me."" I had nothing on, not even my"
14831,EMILY BARTON,old straw bonnet that I used to wear in the garden; but I did not mind
14832,EMILY BARTON,"that, and I ran by his side a good way, till we met the chaise, and"
14833,EMILY BARTON,"the old man riding with the driver. The gentleman said, ""Get down and"
14834,EMILY BARTON,"open the door,"" and then he lifted me in. The old man looked in a sad"
14835,EMILY BARTON,"fright, and said, ""O sir, I hope you are not going to take the child"
14836,EMILY BARTON,"away."" The gentleman threw out a small card, and bid him give that to"
14837,EMILY BARTON,"his master, and calling to the post-boy to drive on, we lost sight of"
14838,EMILY BARTON,the old man in a minute.
14839,EMILY BARTON,
14840,EMILY BARTON,"The gentleman laughed very much, and said, ""We have frightened the old"
14841,EMILY BARTON,"man, he thinks I am going to run away with you;"" and I laughed, and"
14842,EMILY BARTON,"thought it a very good joke; and he said, ""So you tell me you are very"
14843,EMILY BARTON,"shy;"" and I replied ""Yes, sir, I am, before strangers:"" he said, ""So I"
14844,EMILY BARTON,"perceive, you are,"" and then he laughed again, and I laughed, though"
14845,EMILY BARTON,"I did not know why. We had such a merry ride, laughing all the way at"
14846,EMILY BARTON,"one thing or another, till we came to a town where the chaise stopped,"
14847,EMILY BARTON,and he ordered some breakfast. When I got out I began to shiver a
14848,EMILY BARTON,"little; for it was the latter end of autumn, the leaves were falling"
14849,EMILY BARTON,"off the trees, and the air blew very cold. Then he desired the waiter"
14850,EMILY BARTON,"to go and order a straw-hat, and a little warm coat for me; and when"
14851,EMILY BARTON,"the milliner came, he told her he had stolen a little heiress, and we"
14852,EMILY BARTON,"were going to Gretna Green in such a hurry, that the young lady had no"
14853,EMILY BARTON,time to put on her bonnet before she came out. The milliner said I was
14854,EMILY BARTON,"a pretty little heiress, and she wished us a pleasant journey. When"
14855,EMILY BARTON,"we had breakfasted, and I was equipped in my new coat and bonnet, I"
14856,EMILY BARTON,"jumped into the chaise again, as warm and as lively as a little bird."
14857,EMILY BARTON,
14858,EMILY BARTON,"When it grew dark, we entered a large city; the chaise began to roll"
14859,EMILY BARTON,"over the stones, and I saw the lamps ranged along London streets."
14860,EMILY BARTON,
14861,EMILY BARTON,"Though we had breakfasted and dined upon the road, and I had got out"
14862,EMILY BARTON,"of one chaise into another many times, and was now riding on in the"
14863,EMILY BARTON,"dark, I never once considered where I was, or where I was going to."
14864,EMILY BARTON,"I put my head out of the chaise window, and admired those beautiful"
14865,EMILY BARTON,"lights. I was sorry when the chaise stopped, and I could no longer"
14866,EMILY BARTON,look at the brilliant rows of lighted lamps.
14867,EMILY BARTON,
14868,EMILY BARTON,"Taken away by a stranger under a pretence of a short ride, and"
14869,EMILY BARTON,"brought quite to London, do you not expect some perilous end of this"
14870,EMILY BARTON,"adventure? Ah! it was my papa himself, though I did not know who he"
14871,EMILY BARTON,"was, till after he had put me into my mamma's arms, and told her how"
14872,EMILY BARTON,"he had run away with his own little daughter. ""It is your papa, my"
14873,EMILY BARTON,"dear, that has brought you to your own home."" ""This is your mamma, my"
14874,EMILY BARTON,"love,"" they both exclaimed at once. Mamma cried for joy to see me, and"
14875,EMILY BARTON,"she wept again, when she heard my papa tell what a neglected child"
14876,EMILY BARTON,"I had been at my uncle's. This he had found out, he said, by my own"
14877,EMILY BARTON,"innocent prattle, and that he was so offended with his brother, my"
14878,EMILY BARTON,"uncle, that he would not enter his house; and then he said what a"
14879,EMILY BARTON,"little happy good child I had been all the way, and that when he found"
14880,EMILY BARTON,"I did not know him, he would not tell me who he was, for the sake"
14881,EMILY BARTON,of the pleasant surprise it would be to me. It was a surprise and a
14882,EMILY BARTON,"happiness indeed, after living with unkind relations, all at once to"
14883,EMILY BARTON,know I was at home with my own dear papa and mamma.
14884,EMILY BARTON,
14885,EMILY BARTON,"My mamma ordered tea. Whenever I happen to like my tea very much,"
14886,EMILY BARTON,I always think of the delicious cup of tea mamma gave us after our
14887,EMILY BARTON,"journey. I think I see the urn smoking before me now, and papa"
14888,EMILY BARTON,"wheeling the sopha round, that I might sit between them at the table."
14889,EMILY BARTON,
14890,EMILY BARTON,"Mamma called me Little Run-away, and said it was very well it was"
14891,EMILY BARTON,"only papa. I told her how we frightened the old gardener, and opened"
14892,EMILY BARTON,"my eyes to shew her how he stared, and how my papa made the milliner"
14893,EMILY BARTON,"believe we were going to Gretna Green. Mamma looked grave, and said"
14894,EMILY BARTON,she was almost frightened to find I had been so fearless; but I
14895,EMILY BARTON,promised her another time I would not go into a post-chaise with a
14896,EMILY BARTON,"gentleman, without asking him who he was; and then she laughed, and"
14897,EMILY BARTON,seemed very well satisfied.
14898,EMILY BARTON,
14899,EMILY BARTON,"Mamma, to my fancy, looked very handsome. She was very nicely dressed,"
14900,EMILY BARTON,"quite like a fine lady. I held up my head, and felt very proud that I"
14901,EMILY BARTON,"had such a papa and mamma. I thought to myself, ""O dear, my cousins'"
14902,EMILY BARTON,"papa and mamma are not to be compared to mine."""
14903,EMILY BARTON,
14904,EMILY BARTON,"Papa said, ""What makes you bridle and simper so, Emily?"" Then I told"
14905,EMILY BARTON,him all that was in my mind. Papa asked if I did not think him as
14906,EMILY BARTON,"pretty as I did mamma. I could not say much for his beauty, but I told"
14907,EMILY BARTON,"him he was a much finer gentleman than my uncle, and that I liked him"
14908,EMILY BARTON,"the first moment I saw him, because he looked so good-natured. He"
14909,EMILY BARTON,"said, ""Well then, he must be content with that half-praise; but he"
14910,EMILY BARTON,"had always thought himself very handsome."" ""O dear!"" said I, and fell"
14911,EMILY BARTON,"a-laughing, till I spilt my tea, and mamma called me Little aukward"
14912,EMILY BARTON,girl.
14913,EMILY BARTON,
14914,EMILY BARTON,"The next morning my papa was going to the Bank to receive some money,"
14915,EMILY BARTON,"and he took mamma and me with him, that I might have a ride through"
14916,EMILY BARTON,London streets. Everyone that has been in London must have seen the
14917,EMILY BARTON,"Bank, and therefore you may imagine what an effect the fine large"
14918,EMILY BARTON,"rooms, and the bustle and confusion of people had on me; who was grown"
14919,EMILY BARTON,"such a little wondering rustic, that the crowded streets and the fine"
14920,EMILY BARTON,"shops, alone kept me in continual admiration."
14921,EMILY BARTON,
14922,EMILY BARTON,"As we were returning home down Cheapside, papa said, ""Emily shall take"
14923,EMILY BARTON,home some little books.--Shall we order the coachman to the corner
14924,EMILY BARTON,"of St. Paul's church-yard, or shall we go to the Juvenile Library in"
14925,EMILY BARTON,"Skinner-street?"" Mamma said she would go to Skinner-street, for she"
14926,EMILY BARTON,wanted to look at the new buildings there. Papa bought me seven new
14927,EMILY BARTON,"books, and the lady in the shop persuaded him to take more, but mamma"
14928,EMILY BARTON,said that was quite enough at present.
14929,EMILY BARTON,
14930,EMILY BARTON,"We went home by Ludgate-hill, because mamma wanted to buy something"
14931,EMILY BARTON,"there; and while she went into a shop, papa heard me read in one of my"
14932,EMILY BARTON,"new books, and he said he was glad to find I could read so well; for I"
14933,EMILY BARTON,had forgot to tell him my aunt used to hear me read every day.
14934,EMILY BARTON,
14935,EMILY BARTON,"My papa stopped the coach opposite to St. Dunstan's church, that I"
14936,EMILY BARTON,"might see the great iron figures strike upon the bell, to give notice"
14937,EMILY BARTON,that it was a quarter of an hour past two. We waited some time that
14938,EMILY BARTON,"I might see this sight, but just at the moment they were striking, I"
14939,EMILY BARTON,happened to be looking at a toy-shop that was on the other side of
14940,EMILY BARTON,"the way, and unluckily missed it. Papa said, ""Never mind: we will go"
14941,EMILY BARTON,"into the toyshop, and I dare say we shall find something that will"
14942,EMILY BARTON,"console you for your disappointment."" ""Do,"" said mamma, ""for I knew"
14943,EMILY BARTON,"miss Pearson, that keeps this shop, at Weymouth, when I was a little"
14944,EMILY BARTON,"girl, not much older than Emily. Take notice of her;--she is a very"
14945,EMILY BARTON,"intelligent old lady."" Mamma made herself known to miss Pearson, and"
14946,EMILY BARTON,"shewed me to her, but I did not much mind what they said; no more did"
14947,EMILY BARTON,papa;--for we were busy among the toys.
14948,EMILY BARTON,
14949,EMILY BARTON,"A large wax doll, a baby-house completely furnished, and several other"
14950,EMILY BARTON,"beautiful toys, were bought for me. I sat and looked at them with an"
14951,EMILY BARTON,amazing deal of pleasure as we rode home--they quite filled up one
14952,EMILY BARTON,side of the coach.
14953,EMILY BARTON,
14954,EMILY BARTON,"The joy I discovered at possessing things I could call my own, and"
14955,EMILY BARTON,"the frequent repetition of the words, _My own, my own_, gave my mamma"
14956,EMILY BARTON,some uneasiness. She justly feared that the cold treatment I had
14957,EMILY BARTON,"experienced at my uncle's had made me selfish, and therefore she"
14958,EMILY BARTON,"invited a little girl to spend a few days with me, to see, as she has"
14959,EMILY BARTON,"since told me, if I should not be liable to fall into the same error"
14960,EMILY BARTON,from which I had suffered so much at my uncle's.
14961,EMILY BARTON,
14962,EMILY BARTON,"As my mamma had feared, so the event proved; for I quickly adopted"
14963,EMILY BARTON,"my cousins' selfish ideas, and gave the young lady notice that they"
14964,EMILY BARTON,"were my own plaything's, and she must not amuse herself with them any"
14965,EMILY BARTON,longer than I permitted her. Then presently I took occasion to begin
14966,EMILY BARTON,"a little quarrel with her, and said, ""I have got a mamma now, miss"
14967,EMILY BARTON,"Frederica, as well as you, and I will go and tell her, and she will"
14968,EMILY BARTON,"not let you play with my doll any longer than I please, because it"
14969,EMILY BARTON,"is my own doll."" And I very well remember I imitated as nearly as I"
14970,EMILY BARTON,"could, the haughty tone in which my cousins used to speak to me."
14971,EMILY BARTON,
14972,EMILY BARTON,"""Oh, fie! Emily,"" said my mamma; ""can you be the little girl, who used"
14973,EMILY BARTON,to be so distressed because your cousins would not let you play with
14974,EMILY BARTON,their dolls? Do you not see you are doing the very same unkind thing
14975,EMILY BARTON,"to your play-fellow, that they did to you?"" Then I saw as plain as"
14976,EMILY BARTON,"could be what a naughty girl I was, and I promised not to do so any"
14977,EMILY BARTON,more.
14978,EMILY BARTON,
14979,EMILY BARTON,"A lady was sitting with mamma, and mamma said, ""I believe I must"
14980,EMILY BARTON,"pardon you this once, but I hope never to see such a thing again. This"
14981,EMILY BARTON,"lady is miss Frederica's mamma, and I am quite ashamed that she should"
14982,EMILY BARTON,"be witness to your inhospitality to her daughter, particularly as she"
14983,EMILY BARTON,was so kind to come on purpose to invite you to a share in her _own_
14984,EMILY BARTON,private box at the theatre this evening. Her carriage is waiting at
14985,EMILY BARTON,"the door to take us, but how can we accept of the invitation after"
14986,EMILY BARTON,"what has happened?"" The lady begged it might all be forgotten; and"
14987,EMILY BARTON,"mamma consented that I should go, and she said, ""But I hope, my dear"
14988,EMILY BARTON,"Emily, when you are sitting in the play-house, you will remember that"
14989,EMILY BARTON,pleasures are far more delightful when they are shared among numbers.
14990,EMILY BARTON,"If the whole theatre were your own, and you were sitting by yourself"
14991,EMILY BARTON,"to see the performance, how dull it would seem, to what you will find"
14992,EMILY BARTON,"it, with so many happy faces around us, all amused with the same"
14993,EMILY BARTON,"thing!"" I hardly knew what my mamma meant, for I had never seen a"
14994,EMILY BARTON,"play; but when I got there, after the curtain drew up, I looked up"
14995,EMILY BARTON,"towards the galleries, and down into the pit, and into all the boxes,"
14996,EMILY BARTON,and then I knew what a pretty sight it was to see a number of happy
14997,EMILY BARTON,"faces. I was very well convinced, that it would not have been half so"
14998,EMILY BARTON,"cheerful if the theatre had been my own, to have sat there by myself."
14999,EMILY BARTON,"From that time, whenever I felt inclined to be selfish, I used to"
15000,EMILY BARTON,"remember the theatre, where the mamma of the young lady I had been so"
15001,EMILY BARTON,"rude to, gave me a seat in her own box. There is nothing in the world"
15002,EMILY BARTON,so charming as going to a play. All the way there I was as dull and as
15003,EMILY BARTON,"silent as I used to be in ----shire, because I was so sorry mamma had"
15004,EMILY BARTON,"been displeased with me. Just as the coach stopped, miss Frederica"
15005,EMILY BARTON,"said, ""Will you be friends with me, Emily?"" and I replied, ""Yes, if"
15006,EMILY BARTON,"you please, Frederica;"" and we went hand in hand together into the"
15007,EMILY BARTON,"house. I did not speak any more till we entered the box, but after"
15008,EMILY BARTON,that I was as lively as if nothing at all had happened.
15009,EMILY BARTON,
15010,EMILY BARTON,I shall never forget how delighted I was at the first sight of the
15011,EMILY BARTON,"house. My little friend and I were placed together in the front, while"
15012,EMILY BARTON,"our mammas retired to the back part of the box to chat by themselves,"
15013,EMILY BARTON,for they had been so kind as to come very early that I might look
15014,EMILY BARTON,about me before the performance began.
15015,EMILY BARTON,
15016,EMILY BARTON,Frederica had been very often at a play. She was very useful in
15017,EMILY BARTON,telling me what every thing was. She made me observe how the common
15018,EMILY BARTON,"people were coming bustling down the benches in the galleries, as if"
15019,EMILY BARTON,they were afraid they should lose their places. She told me what a
15020,EMILY BARTON,"crowd these poor people had to go through, before they got into the"
15021,EMILY BARTON,"house. Then she shewed me how leisurely they all came into the pit,"
15022,EMILY BARTON,"and looked about them, before they took their seats. She gave me a"
15023,EMILY BARTON,"charming description of the king and queen at the play, and shewed me"
15024,EMILY BARTON,"where they sate, and told me how the princesses were drest. It was a"
15025,EMILY BARTON,pretty sight to see the remainder of the candles lighted; and so it
15026,EMILY BARTON,was to see the musicians come up from under the stage. I admired the
15027,EMILY BARTON,"music very much, and I asked if that was the play. Frederica laughed"
15028,EMILY BARTON,"at my ignorance, and then she told me, when the play began, the green"
15029,EMILY BARTON,"curtain would draw up to the sound of soft music, and I should hear a"
15030,EMILY BARTON,"lady dressed in black say,"
15031,EMILY BARTON,
15032,EMILY BARTON,"""Music hath charms to soothe a savage breast:"""
15033,EMILY BARTON,
15034,EMILY BARTON,"and those were the very first words the actress, whose name was"
15035,EMILY BARTON,"Almeria, spoke. When the curtain began to draw up, and I saw the"
15036,EMILY BARTON,"bottom of her black petticoat, and heard the soft music, what an"
15037,EMILY BARTON,agitation I was in! But before that we had long to wait. Frederica
15038,EMILY BARTON,"told me we should wait till all the dress boxes were full, and then"
15039,EMILY BARTON,the lights would pop up under the orchestra; the second music would
15040,EMILY BARTON,"play, and then the play would begin."
15041,EMILY BARTON,
15042,EMILY BARTON,This play was the Mourning Bride. It was a very moving tragedy; and
15043,EMILY BARTON,"after that when the curtain dropt, and I thought it was all over, I"
15044,EMILY BARTON,saw the most diverting pantomime that ever was seen. I made a strange
15045,EMILY BARTON,"blunder the next day, for I told papa that Almeria was married to"
15046,EMILY BARTON,"Harlequin at last; but I assure you I meant to say Columbine, for I"
15047,EMILY BARTON,knew very well that Almeria was married to Alphonso; for she said she
15048,EMILY BARTON,"was in the first scene. She thought he was dead, but she found him"
15049,EMILY BARTON,"again, just as I did my papa and mamma, when she least expected it."

15057,MARIA HOWE,
15058,MARIA HOWE,(_By Charles Lamb_)
15059,MARIA HOWE,
15060,MARIA HOWE,
15061,MARIA HOWE,I was brought up in the country. From my infancy I was always a
15062,MARIA HOWE,"weak and tender-spirited girl, subject to fears and depressions."
15063,MARIA HOWE,"My parents, and particularly my mother, were of a very different"
15064,MARIA HOWE,disposition. They were what is usually called gay: they loved
15065,MARIA HOWE,"pleasure, and parties, and visiting; but as they found the turn of my"
15066,MARIA HOWE,"mind to be quite opposite, they gave themselves little trouble about"
15067,MARIA HOWE,"me, but upon such occasions generally left me to my choice, which was"
15068,MARIA HOWE,"much oftener to stay at home, and indulge myself in my solitude, than"
15069,MARIA HOWE,"to join in their rambling visits. I was always fond of being alone,"
15070,MARIA HOWE,yet always in a manner afraid. There was a book-closet which led into
15071,MARIA HOWE,my mother's dressing-room. Here I was eternally fond of being shut
15072,MARIA HOWE,"up by myself, to take down whatever volumes I pleased, and pore upon"
15073,MARIA HOWE,"them, no matter whether they were fit for my years or no, or whether I"
15074,MARIA HOWE,"understood them. Here, when the weather would not permit my going into"
15075,MARIA HOWE,"the dark walk, _my walk_, as it was called, in the garden; here when"
15076,MARIA HOWE,"my parents have been from home, I have stayed for hours together,"
15077,MARIA HOWE,"till the loneliness which pleased me so at first, has at length"
15078,MARIA HOWE,"become quite frightful, and I have rushed out of the closet into the"
15079,MARIA HOWE,"inhabited parts of the house, and sought refuge in the lap of some one"
15080,MARIA HOWE,"of the female servants, or of my aunt, who would say, seeing me look"
15081,MARIA HOWE,"pale, that Hannah [Maria] had been frightening herself with some of"
15082,MARIA HOWE,"those _nasty books_: so she used to call my favourite volumes, which I"
15083,MARIA HOWE,"would not have parted with, no not with one of the least of them, if I"
15084,MARIA HOWE,had had the choice to be made a fine princess and to govern the world.
15085,MARIA HOWE,"But my aunt was no reader. She used to excuse herself, and say, that"
15086,MARIA HOWE,reading hurt her eyes. I have been naughty enough to think that this
15087,MARIA HOWE,"was only an excuse, for I found that my aunt's weak eyes did not"
15088,MARIA HOWE,"prevent her from poring ten hours a day upon her prayer-book, or"
15089,MARIA HOWE,her favourite Thomas à Kempis. But this was always her excuse for
15090,MARIA HOWE,not reading any of the books I recommended. My aunt was my father's
15091,MARIA HOWE,sister. She had never been married. My father was a good deal older
15092,MARIA HOWE,"than my mother, and my aunt was ten years older than my father. As I"
15093,MARIA HOWE,"was often left at home with her, and as my serious disposition so well"
15094,MARIA HOWE,"agreed with hers, an intimacy grew up between the old lady and me, and"
15095,MARIA HOWE,"she would often say, that she only loved one person in the world, and"
15096,MARIA HOWE,that was me. Not that she and my parents were on very bad terms; but
15097,MARIA HOWE,the old lady did not feel herself respected enough. The attention and
15098,MARIA HOWE,"fondness which she shewed to me, conscious as I was that I was almost"
15099,MARIA HOWE,"the only being she felt any thing like fondness to, made me love her,"
15100,MARIA HOWE,as it was natural; indeed I am ashamed to say that I fear I almost
15101,MARIA HOWE,loved her better than both my parents put together. But there was an
15102,MARIA HOWE,"oddness, a silence about my aunt, which was never interrupted but by"
15103,MARIA HOWE,"her occasional expressions of love to me, that made me stand in fear"
15104,MARIA HOWE,of her. An odd look from under her spectacles would sometimes scare me
15105,MARIA HOWE,"away, when I had been peering up in her face to make her kiss me. Then"
15106,MARIA HOWE,"she had a way of muttering to herself, which, though it was good words"
15107,MARIA HOWE,"and religious words that she was mumbling, somehow I did not like. My"
15108,MARIA HOWE,"weak spirits, and the fears I was subject to, always made me afraid of"
15109,MARIA HOWE,"any personal singularity or oddness in any one. I am ashamed, ladies,"
15110,MARIA HOWE,"to lay open so many particulars of our family; but, indeed it is"
15111,MARIA HOWE,"necessary to the understanding of what I am going to tell you, of a"
15112,MARIA HOWE,"very great weakness, if not wickedness, which I was guilty of towards"
15113,MARIA HOWE,"my aunt. But I must return to my studies, and tell you what books I"
15114,MARIA HOWE,"found in the closet, and what reading I chiefly admired. There was a"
15115,MARIA HOWE,"great Book of Martyrs in which I used to read, or rather I used to"
15116,MARIA HOWE,spell out meanings; for I was too ignorant to make out many words; but
15117,MARIA HOWE,there it was written all about those good men who chose to be burnt
15118,MARIA HOWE,"alive, rather than forsake their religion, and become naughty papists."
15119,MARIA HOWE,"Some words I could make out, some I could not; but I made out enough"
15120,MARIA HOWE,"to fill my little head with vanity, and I used to think I was so"
15121,MARIA HOWE,"courageous I could be burnt too, and I would put my hands upon the"
15122,MARIA HOWE,"flames which were pictured in the pretty pictures which the book had,"
15123,MARIA HOWE,"and feel them; but, you know, ladies, there is a great difference"
15124,MARIA HOWE,"between the flames in a picture, and real fire, and I am now ashamed"
15125,MARIA HOWE,"of the conceit which I had of my own courage, and think how poor a"
15126,MARIA HOWE,martyr I should have made in those days. Then there was a book not
15127,MARIA HOWE,"so big, but it had pictures in, it was called Culpepper's Herbal; it"
15128,MARIA HOWE,"was full of pictures of plants and herbs, but I did not much care for"
15129,MARIA HOWE,"that. Then there was Salmon's Modern History, out of which I picked"
15130,MARIA HOWE,"a good deal. It had pictures of Chinese gods, and the great hooded"
15131,MARIA HOWE,serpent which ran strangely in my fancy. There were some law books
15132,MARIA HOWE,"too, but the old English frighted me from reading them. But above all,"
15133,MARIA HOWE,"what I relished was Stackhouse's History of the Bible, where there"
15134,MARIA HOWE,was the picture of the Ark and all the beasts getting into it. This
15135,MARIA HOWE,"delighted me, because it puzzled me, and many an aching head have I"
15136,MARIA HOWE,"got with poring into it, and contriving how it might be built, with"
15137,MARIA HOWE,"such and such rooms, to hold all the world if there should be another"
15138,MARIA HOWE,"flood, and sometimes settling what pretty beasts should be saved,"
15139,MARIA HOWE,"and what should not, for I would have no ugly or deformed beast in"
15140,MARIA HOWE,"my pretty ark. But this was only a piece of folly and vanity, that"
15141,MARIA HOWE,a little reflection might cure me of. Foolish girl that I was! to
15142,MARIA HOWE,"suppose that any creature is really ugly, that has all its limbs"
15143,MARIA HOWE,"contrived with heavenly wisdom, and was doubtless formed to some"
15144,MARIA HOWE,"beautiful end, though a child cannot comprehend it.--Doubtless a frog"
15145,MARIA HOWE,or a toad is not uglier in itself than a squirrel or a pretty green
15146,MARIA HOWE,lizard; but we want understanding to see it.
15147,MARIA HOWE,
15148,MARIA HOWE,"[_Here I must remind you, my dear miss Howe, that one of the young"
15149,MARIA HOWE,"ladies smiled, and two or three were seen to titter, at this part of"
15150,MARIA HOWE,"your narration, and you seemed, I thought, a little too angry for"
15151,MARIA HOWE,"a girl of your sense and reading; but you will remember, my dear,"
15152,MARIA HOWE,that young heads are not always able to bear strange and unusual
15153,MARIA HOWE,"assertions; and if some elder person possibly, or some book which"
15154,MARIA HOWE,"you have found, had not put it into your head, you would hardly have"
15155,MARIA HOWE,"discovered by your own reflection, that a frog or a toad was equal in"
15156,MARIA HOWE,"real loveliness to a frisking squirrel, or a pretty green lizard, as"
15157,MARIA HOWE,you called it; not remembering that at this very time you gave the
15158,MARIA HOWE,"lizard the name of pretty, and left it out to the frog--so liable we"
15159,MARIA HOWE,all are to prejudices. But you went on with your story._]
15160,MARIA HOWE,
15161,MARIA HOWE,"These fancies, ladies, were not so very foolish or naughty perhaps,"
15162,MARIA HOWE,but they may be forgiven in a child of six years old; but what I am
15163,MARIA HOWE,"going to tell I shall be ashamed of, and repent, I hope, as long as"
15164,MARIA HOWE,I live. It will teach me not to form rash judgements. Besides the
15165,MARIA HOWE,"picture of the Ark, and many others which I have forgot, Stackhouse"
15166,MARIA HOWE,contained one picture which made more impression upon my childish
15167,MARIA HOWE,understanding than all the rest. It was the picture of the raising
15168,MARIA HOWE,"up of Samuel, which I used to call the Witch of Endor picture. I was"
15169,MARIA HOWE,always very fond of picking up stories about witches. There was a book
15170,MARIA HOWE,"called Glanvil on Witches, which used to lie about in this closet; it"
15171,MARIA HOWE,"was thumbed about, and shewed it had been much read in former times."
15172,MARIA HOWE,This was my treasure. Here I used to pick out the strangest stories.
15173,MARIA HOWE,My not being able to read them very well probably made them appear
15174,MARIA HOWE,more strange and out of the way to me. But I could collect enough to
15175,MARIA HOWE,understand that witches were old women who gave themselves up to do
15176,MARIA HOWE,"mischief;--how, by the help of spirits as bad as themselves, they"
15177,MARIA HOWE,"lamed cattle, and made the corn not grow; and how they made images of"
15178,MARIA HOWE,"wax to stand for people that had done them any injury, or they thought"
15179,MARIA HOWE,had done them injury; and how they burnt the images before a slow
15180,MARIA HOWE,"fire, and stuck pins in them; and the persons which these waxen images"
15181,MARIA HOWE,"represented, however far distant, felt all the pains and torments in"
15182,MARIA HOWE,"good earnest, which were inflicted in show upon these images: and such"
15183,MARIA HOWE,"a horror I had of these wicked witches, that though I am now better"
15184,MARIA HOWE,"instructed, and look upon all these stories as mere idle tales, and"
15185,MARIA HOWE,"invented to fill people's heads with nonsense, yet I cannot recall to"
15186,MARIA HOWE,"mind the horrors which I then felt, without shuddering and feeling"
15187,MARIA HOWE,something of the old fit return.
15188,MARIA HOWE,
15189,MARIA HOWE,"[_Here, my dear miss Howe, you may remember, that miss M----, the"
15190,MARIA HOWE,"youngest of our party, shewing some more curiosity than usual, I"
15191,MARIA HOWE,"winked upon you to hasten to your story, lest the terrors which you"
15192,MARIA HOWE,"were describing should make too much impression upon a young head, and"
15193,MARIA HOWE,"you kindly understood my sign, and said less upon the subject of your"
15194,MARIA HOWE,"fears, than I fancy you first intended._]"
15195,MARIA HOWE,
15196,MARIA HOWE,"This foolish book of witch stories had no pictures in it, but I made"
15197,MARIA HOWE,"up for them out of my own fancy, and out of the great picture of the"
15198,MARIA HOWE,raising up of Samuel in Stackhouse. I was not old enough to understand
15199,MARIA HOWE,the difference there was between these silly improbable tales which
15200,MARIA HOWE,"imputed such powers to poor old women, who are the most helpless"
15201,MARIA HOWE,"things in the creation, and the narrative in the Bible, which does not"
15202,MARIA HOWE,"say, that the witch or pretended witch, raised up the dead body of"
15203,MARIA HOWE,"Samuel by her own power, but as it clearly appears, he was permitted"
15204,MARIA HOWE,"by the divine will to appear, to confound the presumption of Saul; and"
15205,MARIA HOWE,that the witch herself was really as much frightened and confounded
15206,MARIA HOWE,"at the miracle as Saul himself, not expecting a real appearance; but"
15207,MARIA HOWE,"probably having prepared some juggling, slight-of-hand tricks and"
15208,MARIA HOWE,"sham appearance, to deceive the eyes of Saul: whereas she, nor any"
15209,MARIA HOWE,"one living, had ever the power to raise the dead to life, but only"
15210,MARIA HOWE,He who made them from the first. These reasons I might have read in
15211,MARIA HOWE,"Stackhouse itself, if I had been old enough, and have read them in"
15212,MARIA HOWE,"that very book since I was older, but at that time I looked at little"
15213,MARIA HOWE,beyond the picture.
15214,MARIA HOWE,
15215,MARIA HOWE,"These stories of witches so terrified me, that my sleeps were broken,"
15216,MARIA HOWE,and in my dreams I always had a fancy of a witch being in the room
15217,MARIA HOWE,with me. I know now that it was only nervousness; but though I can
15218,MARIA HOWE,"laugh at it now as well as you, ladies, if you knew what I suffered,"
15219,MARIA HOWE,you would be thankful that you have had sensible people about you to
15220,MARIA HOWE,instruct you and teach you better. I was let grow up wild like an ill
15221,MARIA HOWE,"weed, and thrived accordingly. One night that I had been terrified in"
15222,MARIA HOWE,"my sleep with my imaginations, I got out of bed, and crept softly to"
15223,MARIA HOWE,the adjoining room. My room was next to where my aunt usually sat when
15224,MARIA HOWE,she was alone. Into her room I crept for relief from my fears. The
15225,MARIA HOWE,"old lady was not yet retired to rest, but was sitting with her eyes"
15226,MARIA HOWE,"half open, half closed; her spectacles tottering upon her nose; her"
15227,MARIA HOWE,head nodding over her prayer-book; her lips mumbling the words as she
15228,MARIA HOWE,"read them, or half read them, in her dozing posture; her grotesque"
15229,MARIA HOWE,"appearance; her old-fashioned dress, resembling what I had seen in"
15230,MARIA HOWE,"that fatal picture in Stackhouse; all this, with the dead time of"
15231,MARIA HOWE,"night, as it seemed to me, (for I had gone through my first sleep,)"
15232,MARIA HOWE,"all joined to produce a wicked fancy in me, that the form which I had"
15233,MARIA HOWE,beheld was not my aunt but some witch. Her mumbling of her prayers
15234,MARIA HOWE,confirmed me in this shocking idea. I had read in Glanvil of those
15235,MARIA HOWE,"wicked creatures reading their prayers _backwards_, and I thought"
15236,MARIA HOWE,that this was the operation which her lips were at this time employed
15237,MARIA HOWE,about. Instead of flying to her friendly lap for that protection which
15238,MARIA HOWE,"I had so often experienced when I have been weak and timid, I shrunk"
15239,MARIA HOWE,"back terrified and bewildered to my bed, where I lay in broken sleeps"
15240,MARIA HOWE,"and miserable fancies, till the morning, which I had so much reason to"
15241,MARIA HOWE,"wish for, came. My fancies a little wore away with the light, but an"
15242,MARIA HOWE,"impression was fixed, which could not for a long time be done away."
15243,MARIA HOWE,"In the day-time, when my father and mother were about the house, when"
15244,MARIA HOWE,"I saw them familiarly speak to my aunt, my fears all vanished; and"
15245,MARIA HOWE,"when the good creature has taken me upon her knees, and shewn me any"
15246,MARIA HOWE,"kindness more than ordinary, at such times I have melted into tears,"
15247,MARIA HOWE,and longed to tell her what naughty foolish fancies I had had of her.
15248,MARIA HOWE,"But when night returned, that figure which I had seen recurred;--the"
15249,MARIA HOWE,"posture, the half-closed eyes, the mumbling and muttering which I"
15250,MARIA HOWE,"had heard, a confusion was in my head, _who_ it was I had seen that"
15251,MARIA HOWE,"night:--it was my aunt, and it was not my aunt:--it was that good"
15252,MARIA HOWE,"creature who loved me above all the world, engaged at her good task"
15253,MARIA HOWE,"of devotions--perhaps praying for some good to me. Again, it was a"
15254,MARIA HOWE,"witch,--a creature hateful to God and man, reading backwards the good"
15255,MARIA HOWE,prayers; who would perhaps destroy me. In these conflicts of mind I
15256,MARIA HOWE,"passed several weeks, till, by a revolution in my fate, I was removed"
15257,MARIA HOWE,"to the house of a female relation of my mother's, in a distant part"
15258,MARIA HOWE,"of the county, who had come on a visit to our house, and observing my"
15259,MARIA HOWE,"lonely ways, and apprehensive of the ill effect of my mode of living"
15260,MARIA HOWE,"upon my health, begged leave to take me home to her house to reside"
15261,MARIA HOWE,"for a short time. I went, with some reluctance at leaving my closet,"
15262,MARIA HOWE,"my dark walk, and even my aunt, who had been such a source of both"
15263,MARIA HOWE,"love and terror to me. But I went, and soon found the good effects of"
15264,MARIA HOWE,"a change of scene. Instead of melancholy closets, and lonely avenues"
15265,MARIA HOWE,"of trees, I saw lightsome rooms and cheerful faces; I had companions"
15266,MARIA HOWE,of my own age; no books were allowed me but what were rational or
15267,MARIA HOWE,"sprightly; that gave me mirth, or gave me instruction. I soon learned"
15268,MARIA HOWE,to laugh at witch stories; and when I returned after three or four
15269,MARIA HOWE,"months absence to our own house, my good aunt appeared to me in the"
15270,MARIA HOWE,"same light in which I had viewed her from my infancy, before that"
15271,MARIA HOWE,"foolish fancy possessed me, or rather, I should say, more kind, more"
15272,MARIA HOWE,"fond, more loving than before. It is impossible to say how much good"
15273,MARIA HOWE,"that lady, the kind relation of my mother's that I spoke of, did to me"
15274,MARIA HOWE,by changing the scene. Quite a new turn of ideas was given to me. I
15275,MARIA HOWE,became sociable and companionable: my parents soon discovered a change
15276,MARIA HOWE,"in me, and I have found a similar alteration in them. They have been"
15277,MARIA HOWE,"plainly more fond of me since that change, as from that time I learned"
15278,MARIA HOWE,to conform myself more to their way of living. I have never since had
15279,MARIA HOWE,"that aversion to company, and going out with them, which used to make"
15280,MARIA HOWE,them regard me with less fondness than they would have wished to shew.
15281,MARIA HOWE,"I impute almost all that I had to complain of in their neglect, to my"
15282,MARIA HOWE,"having been a little unsociable, uncompanionable mortal. I lived in"
15283,MARIA HOWE,"this manner for a year or two, passing my time between our house, and"
15284,MARIA HOWE,"the lady's who so kindly took me in hand, till by her advice, I was"
15285,MARIA HOWE,"sent to this school; where I have told to you, ladies, what, for fear"
15286,MARIA HOWE,"of ridicule, I never ventured to tell any person besides, the story of"
15287,MARIA HOWE,my foolish and naughty fancy.

15295,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,
15296,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,(_By Mary Lamb_)
15297,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,
15298,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,
15299,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"Until I was eleven years of age, my life was one continued series of"
15300,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"indulgence and delight. My father was a merchant, and supposed to be"
15301,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"in very opulent circumstances, at least I thought so, for at a very"
15302,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,early age I perceived that we lived in a more expensive way than any
15303,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"of my father's friends did. It was not the pride of birth, of which,"
15304,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"miss Withers, you once imagined you might justly boast, but the mere"
15305,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,display of wealth that I was early taught to set an undue value on.
15306,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,My parents spared no cost for masters to instruct me; I had a French
15307,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"governess, and also a woman servant whose sole business it was to"
15308,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"attend on me. My play-room was crowded with toys, and my dress was"
15309,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"the admiration of all my youthful visitors, to whom I gave balls and"
15310,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,entertainments as often as I pleased. I looked down on all my young
15311,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,companions as my inferiors; but I chiefly assumed airs of superiority
15312,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"over Maria Hartley, whose father was a clerk in my father's"
15313,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"counting-house, and therefore I concluded she would regard the"
15314,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,fine show I made with more envy and admiration than any other of
15315,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"my companions. In the days of my humiliation, which I too soon"
15316,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"experienced, I was thrown on the bounty of her father for support."
15317,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"To be a dependent on the charity of her family, seemed the heaviest"
15318,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,evil that could have befallen me; for I remembered how often I had
15319,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"displayed my finery and my expensive ornaments, on purpose to enjoy"
15320,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"the triumph of my superior advantages; and with shame I now speak it,"
15321,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"I have often glanced at her plain linen frock, when I shewed her my"
15322,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"beautiful ball-dresses. Nay, I once gave her a hint, which she so well"
15323,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"understood that she burst into tears, that I could not invite her to"
15324,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"some of my parties, because her mamma once sent her on my birthday in"
15325,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,a coloured frock. I cannot now think of my want of feeling without
15326,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,excessive pain; but one day I saw her highly amused with some curious
15327,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"toys, and on her expressing the pleasure the sight of them gave her,"
15328,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"I said ""Yes, they are very well for those who are not accustomed to"
15329,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"these things; but for my part, I have so many, I am tired of them, and"
15330,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,I am quite delighted to pass an hour in the empty closet your mamma
15331,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"allows you to receive your visitors in, because there is nothing there"
15332,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"to interrupt the conversation."""
15333,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,
15334,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"Once, as I have said, Maria was betrayed into tears: now that I"
15335,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"insulted her by calling her own small apartment an empty closet, she"
15336,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"turned quick upon me, but not in anger, saying, ""O, my dear miss"
15337,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"Wilmot, how very sorry I am--"" here she stopped; and though I knew"
15338,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"not the meaning of her words, I felt it as a reproof. I hung down my"
15339,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"head abashed; yet, perceiving that she was all that day more kind and"
15340,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"obliging than ever, and being conscious of not having merited this"
15341,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"kindness, I thought she was mean-spirited, and therefore I consoled"
15342,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"myself with having discovered this fault in her, for I thought my"
15343,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,arrogance was full as excusable as her meanness.
15344,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,
15345,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"In a few days I knew my error; I learned why Maria had been so kind,"
15346,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"and why she had said she was sorry. It was for me, proud disdainful"
15347,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"girl that I was, that she was sorry; she knew, though I did not, that"
15348,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"my father was on the brink of ruin; and it came to pass, as she had"
15349,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"feared it would, that in a few days my play-room was as empty as"
15350,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"Maria's closet, and all my grandeur was at an end."
15351,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,
15352,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,My father had what is called an execution in the house; every thing
15353,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"was seized that we possessed. Our splendid furniture, and even our"
15354,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"wearing apparel, all my beautiful ball-dresses, my trinkets, and, my"
15355,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"toys, were taken away by my father's merciless creditors. The week in"
15356,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"which this happened was such a scene of hurry, confusion and misery,"
15357,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,that I will not attempt to describe it.
15358,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,
15359,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,At the end of a week I found that my father and mother had gone out
15360,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"very early in the morning. Mr. Hartley took me home to his own house,"
15361,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"and I expected to find them there; but, oh, what anguish did I feel,"
15362,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"when I heard him tell Mrs. Hartley they had quitted England, and that"
15363,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,he had brought me home to live with them! In tears and sullen silence
15364,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,I passed the first day of my entrance into this despised house. Maria
15365,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"was from home. All the day I sate in a corner of the room, grieving"
15366,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,for the departure of my parents; and if for a moment I forgot that
15367,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"sorrow, I tormented myself with imagining the many ways which Maria"
15368,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"might invent, to make me feel in return the slights and airs of"
15369,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,superiority which I had given myself over her. Her mother began
15370,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"the prelude to what I expected, for I heard her freely censure the"
15371,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"imprudence of my parents. She spoke in whispers; yet, though I could"
15372,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"not hear every word, I made out the tenor of her discourse. She was"
15373,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"very anxious, lest her husband should be involved in the ruin of our"
15374,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,house. He was the chief clerk in my father's counting-house; towards
15375,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"evening he came in and quieted her fears, by the welcome news that he"
15376,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,had obtained a more lucrative situation than the one he had lost.
15377,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,
15378,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"At eight in the evening Mrs. Hartley said to me, ""Miss Wilmot, it is"
15379,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"time for you to be in bed, my dear;"" and ordered the servant to shew"
15380,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"me up stairs, adding, that she supposed she must assist me to undress,"
15381,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"but that when Maria came home, she must teach me to wait on myself."
15382,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,The apartment in which I was to sleep was at the top of the house.
15383,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"The walls were white-washed, and the roof was sloping. There was only"
15384,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"one window in the room, a small casement, through which the bright"
15385,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"moon shone, and it seemed to me the most melancholy sight I had ever"
15386,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,beheld. In broken and disturbed slumbers I passed the night. When
15387,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"I awoke in the morning, she whom I most dreaded to see, Maria, who"
15388,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"I supposed had envied my former state, and who I now felt certain"
15389,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"would exult over my present mortifying reverse of fortune, stood by"
15390,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"my bedside. She awakened me from a dream, in which I thought she was"
15391,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"ordering me to fetch her something; and on my refusal, she said I must"
15392,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"obey her, for I was now her servant. Far differently from what my"
15393,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"dreams had pictured, did Maria address me! She said, in the gentlest"
15394,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"tone imaginable, ""My dear miss Wilmot, my mother begs you will come"
15395,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"down to breakfast. Will you give me leave to dress you?"" My proud"
15396,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"heart would not suffer me to speak, and I began to attempt to put on"
15397,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"my clothes; but never having been used to do any thing for myself, I"
15398,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"was unable to perform it, and was obliged to accept of the assistance"
15399,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"of Maria. She dressed me, washed my face, and combed my hair; and as"
15400,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"she did these services for me, she said in the most respectful manner,"
15401,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"""Is this the way you like to wear this, miss Wilmot?"" or, ""Is this"
15402,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"the way you like this done?"" and curtsied, as she gave me every fresh"
15403,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"article to put on. The slights I expected to receive from Maria, would"
15404,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"not have distressed me more, than the delicacy of her behaviour did. I"
15405,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,hung down my head with shame and anguish.
15406,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,
15407,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,In a few days Mrs. Hartley ordered her daughter to instruct me in such
15408,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,useful works and employments as Maria knew. Of every thing which she
15409,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,called useful I was most ignorant. My accomplishments I found were
15410,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"held in small estimation here, by all indeed except Maria. She taught"
15411,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,me nothing without the kindest apologies for being obliged to teach
15412,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"me, who, she said, was so excellent in all elegant arts, and was for"
15413,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"ever thanking me for the pleasure she had formerly received, from"
15414,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"my skill in music and pretty fancy works. The distress I was in,"
15415,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"made these complimentary speeches not flatteries, but sweet drops"
15416,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"of comfort to my degraded heart, almost broken with misfortune and"
15417,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,remorse.
15418,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,
15419,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"I remained at Mr. Hartley's but two months, for at the end of that"
15420,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,time my father inherited a considerable property by the death of a
15421,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"distant relation, which has enabled him to settle his affairs. He"
15422,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,established himself again as a merchant; but as he wished to retrench
15423,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,"his expences, and begin the world again on a plan of strict economy,"
15424,CHARLOTTE WILMOT,he sent me to this school to finish my education.

15436,SUSAN YATES,"I was born and brought up, in a house in which my parents had all"
15437,SUSAN YATES,"their lives resided, which stood in the midst of that lonely tract of"
15438,SUSAN YATES,land called the Lincolnshire fens. Few families besides our own lived
15439,SUSAN YATES,"near the spot, both because it was reckoned an unwholesome air, and"
15440,SUSAN YATES,because its distance from any town or market made it an inconvenient
15441,SUSAN YATES,"situation. My father was in no very affluent circumstances, and it"
15442,SUSAN YATES,"was a sad necessity which he was put to, of having to go many miles"
15443,SUSAN YATES,"to fetch any thing he wanted from the nearest village, which was full"
15444,SUSAN YATES,"seven miles distant, through a sad miry way that at all times made it"
15445,SUSAN YATES,"heavy walking, and after rain was almost impassable. But he had no"
15446,SUSAN YATES,horse or carriage of his own.
15447,SUSAN YATES,
15448,SUSAN YATES,The church which belonged to the parish in which our house was
15449,SUSAN YATES,"situated, stood in this village; and its distance being, as I said"
15450,SUSAN YATES,"before, seven miles from our house, made it quite an impossible thing"
15451,SUSAN YATES,"for my mother or me to think of going to it. Sometimes indeed, on a"
15452,SUSAN YATES,"fine dry Sunday, my father would rise early, and take a walk to the"
15453,SUSAN YATES,"village, just to see how _goodness thrived_, as he used to say, but"
15454,SUSAN YATES,"he would generally return tired, and the worse for his walk. It is"
15455,SUSAN YATES,"scarcely possible to explain to any one who has not lived in the fens,"
15456,SUSAN YATES,"what difficult and dangerous walking it is. A mile is as good as four,"
15457,SUSAN YATES,"I have heard my father say, in those parts. My mother, who in the"
15458,SUSAN YATES,"early part of her life had lived in a more civilised spot, and had"
15459,SUSAN YATES,"been used to constant churchgoing, would often lament her situation."
15460,SUSAN YATES,It was from her I early imbibed a great curiosity and anxiety to see
15461,SUSAN YATES,"that thing, which I had heard her call a church, and so often lament"
15462,SUSAN YATES,"that she could never go to. I had seen houses of various structures,"
15463,SUSAN YATES,"and had seen in pictures the shapes of ships and boats, and palaces"
15464,SUSAN YATES,"and temples, but never rightly any thing that could be called a"
15465,SUSAN YATES,"church, or that could satisfy me about its form. Sometimes I thought"
15466,SUSAN YATES,"it must be like our house, and sometimes I fancied it must be more"
15467,SUSAN YATES,"like the house of our neighbour, Mr. Sutton, which was bigger and"
15468,SUSAN YATES,"handsomer than ours. Sometimes I thought it was a great hollow cave,"
15469,SUSAN YATES,such as I have heard my father say the first inhabitants of the earth
15470,SUSAN YATES,"dwelt in. Then I thought it was like a waggon, or a cart, and that it"
15471,SUSAN YATES,"must be something moveable. The shape of it ran in my mind strangely,"
15472,SUSAN YATES,"and one day I ventured to ask my mother, what was that foolish thing"
15473,SUSAN YATES,"that she was always longing to go to, and which she called a church."
15474,SUSAN YATES,"Was it any thing to eat or drink, or was it only like a great huge"
15475,SUSAN YATES,"play-thing, to be seen and stared at?--I was not quite five years of"
15476,SUSAN YATES,age when I made this inquiry.
15477,SUSAN YATES,
15478,SUSAN YATES,"This question, so oddly put, made my mother smile; but in a little"
15479,SUSAN YATES,"time she put on a more grave look, and informed me, that a church"
15480,SUSAN YATES,"was nothing that I had supposed it, but it was a great building, far"
15481,SUSAN YATES,"greater than any house which I had seen, where men, and women, and"
15482,SUSAN YATES,"children, came together, twice a day, on Sundays, to hear the Bible"
15483,SUSAN YATES,"read, and make good resolutions for the week to come. She told me,"
15484,SUSAN YATES,"that the fine music which we sometimes heard in the air, came from"
15485,SUSAN YATES,"the bells of St. Mary's church, and that we never heard it but when"
15486,SUSAN YATES,the wind was in a particular point. This raised my wonder more than
15487,SUSAN YATES,all the rest; for I had somehow conceived that the noise which I
15488,SUSAN YATES,"heard, was occasioned by birds up in the air, or that it was made"
15489,SUSAN YATES,"by the angels, whom (so ignorant I was till that time) I had always"
15490,SUSAN YATES,considered to be a sort of birds: for before this time I was totally
15491,SUSAN YATES,"ignorant of any thing like religion, it being a principle of my"
15492,SUSAN YATES,"father, that young heads should not be told too many things at once,"
15493,SUSAN YATES,"for fear they should get confused ideas, and no clear notions of any"
15494,SUSAN YATES,"thing. We had always indeed so far observed Sundays, that no work was"
15495,SUSAN YATES,"done upon that day, and upon that day I wore my best muslin frock,"
15496,SUSAN YATES,"and was not allowed to sing, or to be noisy; but I never understood"
15497,SUSAN YATES,why that day should differ from any other. We had no public
15498,SUSAN YATES,"meetings:--indeed the few straggling houses which were near us, would"
15499,SUSAN YATES,have furnished but a slender congregation; and the loneliness of the
15500,SUSAN YATES,"place we lived in, instead of making us more sociable, and drawing"
15501,SUSAN YATES,"us closer together, as my mother used to say it ought to have done,"
15502,SUSAN YATES,seemed to have the effect of making us more distant and averse to
15503,SUSAN YATES,"society than other people. One or two good neighbours indeed we had,"
15504,SUSAN YATES,but not in numbers to give me an idea of church attendance.
15505,SUSAN YATES,
15506,SUSAN YATES,But now my mother thought it high time to give me some clearer
15507,SUSAN YATES,"instruction in the main points of religion, and my father came readily"
15508,SUSAN YATES,into her plan. I was now permitted to sit up half an hour later on a
15509,SUSAN YATES,"Sunday evening, that I might hear a portion of Scripture read, which"
15510,SUSAN YATES,"had always been their custom, though by reason of my tender age, and"
15511,SUSAN YATES,my father's opinion on the impropriety of children being taught too
15512,SUSAN YATES,"young, I had never till now been an auditor. I was taught my prayers,"
15513,SUSAN YATES,"and those things which you, ladies, I doubt not, had the benefit of"
15514,SUSAN YATES,being instructed in at a much earlier age.
15515,SUSAN YATES,
15516,SUSAN YATES,"The clearer my notions on these points became, they only made me"
15517,SUSAN YATES,more passionately long for the privilege of joining in that social
15518,SUSAN YATES,"service, from which it seemed that we alone, of all the inhabitants"
15519,SUSAN YATES,"of the land, were debarred; and when the wind was in that point which"
15520,SUSAN YATES,favoured the sound of the distant bells of St. Mary's to be heard
15521,SUSAN YATES,"over the great moor which skirted our house, I have stood out in the"
15522,SUSAN YATES,air to catch the sounds which I almost devoured; and the tears have
15523,SUSAN YATES,"come in my eyes, when sometimes they seemed to speak to me almost"
15524,SUSAN YATES,"in articulate sounds, to _come to church_, and because of the great"
15525,SUSAN YATES,moor which was between me and them I could not come; and the too
15526,SUSAN YATES,tender apprehensions of these things have filled me with a religious
15527,SUSAN YATES,melancholy. With thoughts like these I entered into my seventh year.
15528,SUSAN YATES,
15529,SUSAN YATES,"And now the time was come, when the great moor was no longer to"
15530,SUSAN YATES,separate me from the object of my wishes and of my curiosity. My
15531,SUSAN YATES,"father having some money left him by the will of a deceased relation,"
15532,SUSAN YATES,"we ventured to set up a sort of a carriage--no very superb one, I"
15533,SUSAN YATES,"assure you, ladies; but in that part of the world it was looked upon"
15534,SUSAN YATES,with some envy by our poorer neighbours. The first party of pleasure
15535,SUSAN YATES,"which my father proposed to take in it, was to the village where I had"
15536,SUSAN YATES,"so often wished to go, and my mother and I were to accompany him; for"
15537,SUSAN YATES,"it was very fit, my father observed, that little Susan should go to"
15538,SUSAN YATES,"church, and learn how to behave herself, for we might some time or"
15539,SUSAN YATES,"other have occasion to live in London, and not always be confined to"
15540,SUSAN YATES,that out of the way spot.
15541,SUSAN YATES,
15542,SUSAN YATES,"It was on a Sunday morning that we set out, my little heart beating"
15543,SUSAN YATES,"with almost breathless expectation. The day was fine, and the roads"
15544,SUSAN YATES,as good as they ever are in those parts. I was so happy and so proud.
15545,SUSAN YATES,I was lost in dreams of what I was going to see. At length the tall
15546,SUSAN YATES,steeple of St. Mary's church came in view. It was pointed out to me by
15547,SUSAN YATES,"my father, as the place from which that music had come which I have"
15548,SUSAN YATES,"heard over the moor, and had fancied to be angels singing. I was wound"
15549,SUSAN YATES,up to the highest pitch of delight at having visibly presented to me
15550,SUSAN YATES,the spot from which had proceeded that unknown friendly music; and
15551,SUSAN YATES,"when it began to peal, just as we approached the village, it seemed to"
15552,SUSAN YATES,"speak. _Susan is come_, as plainly as it used to invite me _to come_,"
15553,SUSAN YATES,when I heard it over the moor. I pass over our alighting at the house
15554,SUSAN YATES,"of a relation, and all that passed till I went with my father and"
15555,SUSAN YATES,mother to church.
15556,SUSAN YATES,
15557,SUSAN YATES,St. Mary's church is a great church for such a small village as it
15558,SUSAN YATES,"stands in. My father said it was a cathedral, and that it had once"
15559,SUSAN YATES,"belonged to a monastery, but the monks were all gone. Over the door"
15560,SUSAN YATES,"there was stone work, representing saints and bishops, and here and"
15561,SUSAN YATES,"there, along the sides of the church, there were figures of men's"
15562,SUSAN YATES,"heads, made in a strange grotesque way: I have since seen the same"
15563,SUSAN YATES,sort of figures in the round tower of the Temple church in London. My
15564,SUSAN YATES,"father said they were very improper ornaments for such a place, and"
15565,SUSAN YATES,so I now think them; but it seems the people who built these great
15566,SUSAN YATES,"churches in old times, gave themselves more liberties than they do"
15567,SUSAN YATES,"now; and I remember that when I first saw them, and before my father"
15568,SUSAN YATES,"had made this observation, though they were so ugly and out of shape,"
15569,SUSAN YATES,and some of them seemed to be grinning and distorting their features
15570,SUSAN YATES,"with pain or with laughter, yet being placed upon a church, to which"
15571,SUSAN YATES,"I had come with such serious thoughts, I could not help thinking"
15572,SUSAN YATES,"they had some serious meaning; and I looked at them with wonder, but"
15573,SUSAN YATES,without any temptation to laugh. I somehow fancied they were the
15574,SUSAN YATES,representation of wicked people set up as a warning.
15575,SUSAN YATES,
15576,SUSAN YATES,"When we got into the church, the service was not begun, and my father"
15577,SUSAN YATES,"kindly took me round, to shew me the monuments and every thing else"
15578,SUSAN YATES,"remarkable. I remember seeing one of a venerable figure, which my"
15579,SUSAN YATES,"father said had been a judge. The figure was kneeling, as if it was"
15580,SUSAN YATES,"alive, before a sort of desk, with a book, I suppose the Bible, lying"
15581,SUSAN YATES,"on it. I somehow fancied the figure had a sort of life in it, it"
15582,SUSAN YATES,"seemed so natural, or that the dead judge that it was done for, said"
15583,SUSAN YATES,"his prayers at it still. This was a silly notion, but I was very"
15584,SUSAN YATES,"young, and had passed my little life in a remote place, where I had"
15585,SUSAN YATES,never seen any thing nor knew any thing; and the awe which I felt at
15586,SUSAN YATES,"first being in a church, took from me all power but that of wondering."
15587,SUSAN YATES,"I did not reason about any thing, I was too young. Now I understand"
15588,SUSAN YATES,"why monuments are put up for the dead, and why the figures which"
15589,SUSAN YATES,"are upon them, are described as doing the actions which they did in"
15590,SUSAN YATES,"their life-times, and that they are a sort of pictures set up for our"
15591,SUSAN YATES,instruction. But all was new and surprising to me on that day; the
15592,SUSAN YATES,"long windows with little panes, the pillars, the pews made of oak, the"
15593,SUSAN YATES,"little hassocks for the people to kneel on, the form of the pulpit"
15594,SUSAN YATES,"with the sounding-board over it, gracefully carved in flower work. To"
15595,SUSAN YATES,"you, who have lived all your lives in populous places, and have been"
15596,SUSAN YATES,"taken to church from the earliest time you can remember, my admiration"
15597,SUSAN YATES,of these things must appear strangely ignorant. But I was a lonely
15598,SUSAN YATES,"young creature, that had been brought up in remote places, where there"
15599,SUSAN YATES,was neither church nor churchgoing inhabitants. I have since lived in
15600,SUSAN YATES,"great towns, and seen the ways of churches and of worship, and I am"
15601,SUSAN YATES,"old enough now to distinguish between what is essential in religion,"
15602,SUSAN YATES,and what is merely formal or ornamental.
15603,SUSAN YATES,
15604,SUSAN YATES,When my father had done pointing out to me the things most worthy of
15605,SUSAN YATES,"notice about the church, the service was almost ready to begin; the"
15606,SUSAN YATES,"parishioners had most of them entered, and taken their seats; and we"
15607,SUSAN YATES,were shewn into a pew where my mother was already seated. Soon after
15608,SUSAN YATES,"the clergyman entered, and the organ began to play what is called"
15609,SUSAN YATES,the voluntary. I had never seen so many people assembled before. At
15610,SUSAN YATES,"first I thought that all eyes were upon me, and that because I was"
15611,SUSAN YATES,a stranger. I was terribly ashamed and confused at first; but my
15612,SUSAN YATES,"mother helped me to find out the places in the Prayer-book, and"
15613,SUSAN YATES,"being busy about that, took off some of my painful apprehensions. I"
15614,SUSAN YATES,"was no stranger to the order of the service, having often read in a"
15615,SUSAN YATES,"Prayer-book at home; but my thoughts being confused, it puzzled me a"
15616,SUSAN YATES,"little to find out the responses and other things, which I thought I"
15617,SUSAN YATES,knew so well; but I went through it tolerably well. One thing which
15618,SUSAN YATES,"has often troubled me since, is, that I am afraid I was too full of"
15619,SUSAN YATES,"myself, and of thinking how happy I was, and what a privilege it was"
15620,SUSAN YATES,"for one that was so young, to join in the service with so many grown"
15621,SUSAN YATES,"people, so that I did not attend enough to the instruction which I"
15622,SUSAN YATES,"might have received. I remember, I foolishly applied every thing that"
15623,SUSAN YATES,"was said to myself, so as it could mean nobody but myself, I was so"
15624,SUSAN YATES,"full of my own thoughts. All that assembly of people, seemed to me as"
15625,SUSAN YATES,if they were come together only to shew me the way of a church. Not
15626,SUSAN YATES,but I received some very affecting impressions from some things which
15627,SUSAN YATES,I heard that day; but the standing up and the sitting down of the
15628,SUSAN YATES,people; the organ; the singing;--the way of all these things took up
15629,SUSAN YATES,more of my attention than was proper; or I thought it did. I believe
15630,SUSAN YATES,"I behaved better and was more serious when I went a second time, and"
15631,SUSAN YATES,"a third time; for now we went as a regular thing every Sunday, and"
15632,SUSAN YATES,"continued to do so, till, by a still further change for the better in"
15633,SUSAN YATES,"my father's circumstances, we removed to London. Oh! it was a happy"
15634,SUSAN YATES,day for me my first going to St. Mary's church: before that day I used
15635,SUSAN YATES,"to feel like a little outcast in the wilderness, like one that did"
15636,SUSAN YATES,not belong to the world of Christian people. I have never felt like a
15637,SUSAN YATES,"little outcast since. But I never can hear the sweet noise of bells,"
15638,SUSAN YATES,"that I don't think of the angels singing, and what poor but pretty"
15639,SUSAN YATES,thoughts I had of angels in my uninstructed solitude.

15647,ARABELLA HARDY,
15648,ARABELLA HARDY,(_By Charles Lamb_)
15649,ARABELLA HARDY,
15650,ARABELLA HARDY,
15651,ARABELLA HARDY,I was born in the East Indies. I lost my father and mother young. At
15652,ARABELLA HARDY,the age of five my relations thought it proper that I should be sent
15653,ARABELLA HARDY,to England for my education. I was to be entrusted to the care of a
15654,ARABELLA HARDY,young woman who had a character for great humanity and discretion; but
15655,ARABELLA HARDY,"just as I had taken leave of my friends, and we were about to take our"
15656,ARABELLA HARDY,"passage, the young woman was taken suddenly ill, and could not go on"
15657,ARABELLA HARDY,"board. In this unpleasant emergency, no one knew how to act. The ship"
15658,ARABELLA HARDY,"was at the very point of sailing, and it was the last ship which was"
15659,ARABELLA HARDY,"to sail that season. At last the captain, who was known to my friends,"
15660,ARABELLA HARDY,"prevailed upon my relation who had come with us to see us embark,"
15661,ARABELLA HARDY,"to leave the young woman on shore, and to let me embark separately."
15662,ARABELLA HARDY,"There was no possibility of getting any other female attendant for me,"
15663,ARABELLA HARDY,in the short time allotted for our preparation; and the opportunity
15664,ARABELLA HARDY,of going by that ship was thought too valuable to be lost. No other
15665,ARABELLA HARDY,ladies happened to be going; so I was consigned to the care of the
15666,ARABELLA HARDY,"captain and his crew,--rough and unaccustomed attendants for a young"
15667,ARABELLA HARDY,"creature, delicately brought up as I had been; but indeed they did"
15668,ARABELLA HARDY,their best to make me not feel the difference. The unpolished sailors
15669,ARABELLA HARDY,were my nursery-maids and my waiting-women. Every thing was done by
15670,ARABELLA HARDY,"the captain and the men, to accommodate me, and make me easy. I had"
15671,ARABELLA HARDY,"a little room made out of the cabin, which was to be considered as"
15672,ARABELLA HARDY,"my room, and nobody might enter into it. The first mate had a great"
15673,ARABELLA HARDY,"character for bravery, and all sailor-like accomplishments; but with"
15674,ARABELLA HARDY,"all this he had a gentleness of manners, and a pale feminine cast of"
15675,ARABELLA HARDY,"face, from ill health and a weakly constitution, which subjected him"
15676,ARABELLA HARDY,"to some little ridicule from the officers, and caused him to be named"
15677,ARABELLA HARDY,"Betsy. He did not much like the appellation, but he submitted to it"
15678,ARABELLA HARDY,"the better, as he knew that those who gave him a woman's name, well"
15679,ARABELLA HARDY,"knew that he had a man's heart, and that in the face of danger he"
15680,ARABELLA HARDY,"would go as far as any man. To this young man, whose real name was"
15681,ARABELLA HARDY,"Charles Atkinson, by a lucky thought of the captain, the care of me"
15682,ARABELLA HARDY,"was especially entrusted. Betsy was proud of his charge, and, to do"
15683,ARABELLA HARDY,"him justice, acquitted himself with great diligence and adroitness"
15684,ARABELLA HARDY,through the whole of the voyage. From the beginning I had somehow
15685,ARABELLA HARDY,"looked upon Betsy as a woman, hearing him so spoken of, and this"
15686,ARABELLA HARDY,"reconciled me in some measure to the want of a maid, which I had been"
15687,ARABELLA HARDY,"used to. But I was a manageable girl at all times, and gave nobody"
15688,ARABELLA HARDY,much trouble.
15689,ARABELLA HARDY,
15690,ARABELLA HARDY,"I have not knowledge enough to give an account of my voyage, or to"
15691,ARABELLA HARDY,"remember the names of the seas we passed through, or the lands which"
15692,ARABELLA HARDY,"we touched upon, in our course. The chief thing I can remember, for I"
15693,ARABELLA HARDY,"do not remember the events of the voyage in any order, was Atkinson"
15694,ARABELLA HARDY,"taking me up on deck, to see the great whales playing about in the"
15695,ARABELLA HARDY,"sea. There was one great whale came bounding up out of the sea, and"
15696,ARABELLA HARDY,"then he would dive into it again, and then would come up at a distance"
15697,ARABELLA HARDY,"where nobody expected him, and another whale was following after him."
15698,ARABELLA HARDY,"Atkinson said they were at play, and that that lesser whale loved that"
15699,ARABELLA HARDY,"bigger whale, and kept it company all through the wide seas: but I"
15700,ARABELLA HARDY,"thought it strange play, and a frightful kind of love; for I every"
15701,ARABELLA HARDY,minute expected they would come up to our ship and toss it. But
15702,ARABELLA HARDY,"Atkinson said a whale was a gentle creature, and it was a sort of"
15703,ARABELLA HARDY,"sea-elephant, and that the most powerful creatures in nature are"
15704,ARABELLA HARDY,always the least hurtful. And he told me how men went out to take
15705,ARABELLA HARDY,"these whales, and stuck long, pointed darts into them; and how the sea"
15706,ARABELLA HARDY,was discoloured with the blood of these poor whales for many miles
15707,ARABELLA HARDY,"distance: and I admired at the courage of the men, but I was sorry"
15708,ARABELLA HARDY,for the inoffensive whale. Many other pretty sights he used to shew
15709,ARABELLA HARDY,"me, when he was not on watch, or doing some duty for the ship. No one"
15710,ARABELLA HARDY,was more attentive to his duty than he; but at such times as he had
15711,ARABELLA HARDY,"leisure, he would shew me all pretty sea sights:--the dolphins and"
15712,ARABELLA HARDY,"porpoises that came before a storm, and all the colours which the sea"
15713,ARABELLA HARDY,"changed to; how sometimes it was a deep blue, and then a deep green,"
15714,ARABELLA HARDY,and sometimes it would seem all on fire: all these various appearances
15715,ARABELLA HARDY,"he would shew me, and attempt to explain the reason of them to me,"
15716,ARABELLA HARDY,as well as my young capacity would admit of. There was a lion and a
15717,ARABELLA HARDY,"tiger on board, going to England as a present to the king, and it"
15718,ARABELLA HARDY,"was a great diversion to Atkinson and me, after I had got rid of my"
15719,ARABELLA HARDY,"first terrors, to see the ways of these beasts in their dens, and how"
15720,ARABELLA HARDY,"venturous the sailors were in putting their hands through the grates,"
15721,ARABELLA HARDY,"and patting their rough coats. Some of the men had monkeys, which ran"
15722,ARABELLA HARDY,"loose about, and the sport was for the men to lose them, and find them"
15723,ARABELLA HARDY,"again. The monkeys would run up the shrouds, and pass from rope to"
15724,ARABELLA HARDY,"rope, with ten times greater alacrity than the most experienced sailor"
15725,ARABELLA HARDY,could follow them; and sometimes they would hide themselves in the
15726,ARABELLA HARDY,"most unthought-of places, and when they were found, they would grin,"
15727,ARABELLA HARDY,and make mouths as if they had sense. Atkinson described to me the
15728,ARABELLA HARDY,"ways of these little animals in their native woods, for he had seen"
15729,ARABELLA HARDY,"them. Oh, how many ways he thought of to amuse me in that long voyage!"
15730,ARABELLA HARDY,
15731,ARABELLA HARDY,Sometimes he would describe to me the odd shapes and varieties of
15732,ARABELLA HARDY,"fishes that were in the sea, and tell me tales of the sea-monsters"
15733,ARABELLA HARDY,"that lay hid at the bottom, and were seldom seen by men; and what a"
15734,ARABELLA HARDY,"glorious sight it would be, if our eyes could be sharpened to behold"
15735,ARABELLA HARDY,"all the inhabitants of the sea at once, swimming in the great deeps,"
15736,ARABELLA HARDY,as plain as we see the gold and silver fish in a bowl of glass. With
15737,ARABELLA HARDY,such notions he enlarged my infant capacity to take in many things.
15738,ARABELLA HARDY,
15739,ARABELLA HARDY,When in foul weather I have been terrified at the motion of the
15740,ARABELLA HARDY,"vessel, as it rocked backwards and forwards, he would still my fears,"
15741,ARABELLA HARDY,"and tell me that I used to be rocked so once in a cradle, and that"
15742,ARABELLA HARDY,"the sea was God's bed, and the ship our cradle, and we were as safe"
15743,ARABELLA HARDY,"in that greater motion, as when we felt that lesser one in our little"
15744,ARABELLA HARDY,"wooden sleeping-places. When the wind was up, and sang through the"
15745,ARABELLA HARDY,"sails, and disturbed me with its violent clamours, he would call it"
15746,ARABELLA HARDY,"music, and bid me hark to the sea-organ, and with that name he quieted"
15747,ARABELLA HARDY,my tender apprehensions. When I have looked around with a mournful
15748,ARABELLA HARDY,"face at seeing all _men_ about me, he would enter into my thoughts,"
15749,ARABELLA HARDY,"and tell me pretty stories of his mother and his sisters, and a female"
15750,ARABELLA HARDY,"cousin that he loved better than his sisters, whom he called Jenny,"
15751,ARABELLA HARDY,"and say that when we got to England I should go and see them, and how"
15752,ARABELLA HARDY,"fond Jenny would be of his little daughter, as he called me; and with"
15753,ARABELLA HARDY,"these images of women and females which he raised in my fancy, he"
15754,ARABELLA HARDY,"quieted me for a time. One time, and never but once, he told me that"
15755,ARABELLA HARDY,"Jenny had promised to be his wife if ever he came to England, but that"
15756,ARABELLA HARDY,"he had his doubts whether he should live to get home, for he was very"
15757,ARABELLA HARDY,sickly. This made me cry bitterly.
15758,ARABELLA HARDY,
15759,ARABELLA HARDY,"That I dwell so long upon the attentions of this Atkinson, is only"
15760,ARABELLA HARDY,"because his death, which happened just before we got to England,"
15761,ARABELLA HARDY,"affected me so much, that he alone of all the ship's crew has"
15762,ARABELLA HARDY,engrossed my mind ever since; though indeed the captain and all
15763,ARABELLA HARDY,"were singularly kind to me, and strove to make up for my uneasy and"
15764,ARABELLA HARDY,"unnatural situation. The boatswain would pipe for my diversion, and"
15765,ARABELLA HARDY,the sailor-boy would climb the dangerous mast for my sport. The rough
15766,ARABELLA HARDY,"foremastman would never willingly appear before me, till he had combed"
15767,ARABELLA HARDY,"his long black hair smooth and sleek, not to terrify me. The officers"
15768,ARABELLA HARDY,"got up a sort of play for my amusement, and Atkinson, or, as they"
15769,ARABELLA HARDY,"called him, Betsy, acted the heroine of the piece. All ways that could"
15770,ARABELLA HARDY,"be contrived, were thought upon, to reconcile me to my lot. I was the"
15771,ARABELLA HARDY,universal favourite;--I do not know how deservedly; but I suppose it
15772,ARABELLA HARDY,"was because I was alone, and there was no female in the ship besides"
15773,ARABELLA HARDY,"me. Had I come over with female relations or attendants, I should have"
15774,ARABELLA HARDY,excited no particular curiosity; I should have required no uncommon
15775,ARABELLA HARDY,attentions. I was one little woman among a crew of men; and I believe
15776,ARABELLA HARDY,"the homage which I have read that men universally pay to women, was in"
15777,ARABELLA HARDY,"this case directed to me, in the absence of all other woman-kind. I do"
15778,ARABELLA HARDY,"not know how that might be, but I was a little princess among them,"
15779,ARABELLA HARDY,and I was not six years old.
15780,ARABELLA HARDY,
15781,ARABELLA HARDY,"I remember the first draw-back which happened to my comfort, was"
15782,ARABELLA HARDY,Atkinson's not appearing during the whole of one day. The captain
15783,ARABELLA HARDY,"tried to reconcile me to it, by saying that Mr. Atkinson was confined"
15784,ARABELLA HARDY,"to his cabin;--that he was not quite well, but a day or two would"
15785,ARABELLA HARDY,"restore him. I begged to be taken in to see him, but this was not"
15786,ARABELLA HARDY,"granted. A day, and then another came, and another, and no Atkinson"
15787,ARABELLA HARDY,"was visible, and I saw apparent solicitude in the faces of all the"
15788,ARABELLA HARDY,"officers, who nevertheless strove to put on their best countenances"
15789,ARABELLA HARDY,"before me, and to be more than usually kind to me. At length, by the"
15790,ARABELLA HARDY,"desire of Atkinson himself, as I have since learned, I was permitted"
15791,ARABELLA HARDY,"to go into his cabin and see him. He was sitting up, apparently in a"
15792,ARABELLA HARDY,"state of great exhaustion, but his face lighted up when he saw me, and"
15793,ARABELLA HARDY,"he kissed me, and told me that he was going a great voyage, far longer"
15794,ARABELLA HARDY,"than that which we had passed together, and he should never come back;"
15795,ARABELLA HARDY,"and though I was so young, I understood well enough that he meant this"
15796,ARABELLA HARDY,"of his death, and I cried sadly; but he comforted me and told me, that"
15797,ARABELLA HARDY,"I must be his little executrix, and perform his last will, and bear"
15798,ARABELLA HARDY,"his last words to his mother and his sister, and to his cousin Jenny,"
15799,ARABELLA HARDY,"whom I should see in a short time; and he gave me his blessing, as"
15800,ARABELLA HARDY,"a father would bless his child, and he sent a last kiss by me to all"
15801,ARABELLA HARDY,"his female relations, and he made me promise that I would go and see"
15802,ARABELLA HARDY,"them when I got to England, and soon after this he died; but I was"
15803,ARABELLA HARDY,"in another part of the ship when he died, and I was not told it till"
15804,ARABELLA HARDY,"we got to shore, which was a few days after; but they kept telling me"
15805,ARABELLA HARDY,"that he was better and better, and that I should soon see him, but"
15806,ARABELLA HARDY,"that it disturbed him to talk with any one. Oh, what a grief it was,"
15807,ARABELLA HARDY,"when I learned that I had lost my old ship-mate, that had made an"
15808,ARABELLA HARDY,irksome situation so bearable by his kind assiduities; and to think
15809,ARABELLA HARDY,"that he was gone, and I could never repay him for his kindness!"
15810,ARABELLA HARDY,
15811,ARABELLA HARDY,"When I had been a year and a half in England, the captain, who"
15812,ARABELLA HARDY,"had made another voyage to India and back, thinking that time had"
15813,ARABELLA HARDY,"alleviated a little the sorrow of Atkinson's relations, prevailed upon"
15814,ARABELLA HARDY,"my friends who had the care of me in England, to let him introduce me"
15815,ARABELLA HARDY,to Atkinson's mother and sister. Jenny was no more; she had died in
15816,ARABELLA HARDY,"the interval, and I never saw her. Grief for his death had brought on"
15817,ARABELLA HARDY,"a consumption, of which she lingered about a twelvemonth, and then"
15818,ARABELLA HARDY,expired. But in the mother and the sisters of this excellent young
15819,ARABELLA HARDY,"man, I have found the most valuable friends which I possess on this"
15820,ARABELLA HARDY,side the great ocean. They received me from the captain as the little
15821,ARABELLA HARDY,"_protégée_ of Atkinson, and from them I have learned passages of his"
15822,ARABELLA HARDY,"former life, and this in particular, that the illness of which he died"
15823,ARABELLA HARDY,"was brought on by a wound of which he never quite recovered, which he"
15824,ARABELLA HARDY,"got in the desperate attempt, when he was quite a boy, to defend his"
15825,ARABELLA HARDY,"captain against a superior force of the enemy which had boarded him,"
15826,ARABELLA HARDY,"and which, by his premature valour inspiriting the men, they finally"
15827,ARABELLA HARDY,"succeeded in repulsing. This was that Atkinson, who, from his"
15828,ARABELLA HARDY,"pale and feminine appearance, was called Betsy. This was he whose"
15829,ARABELLA HARDY,"womanly care of me got him the name of a woman, who, with more than"
15830,ARABELLA HARDY,"female attention, condescended to play the hand-maid to a little"
15831,ARABELLA HARDY,"unaccompanied orphan, that fortune had cast upon the care of a rough"
15832,ARABELLA HARDY,"sea captain, and his rougher crew."

17256,THE REPROOF,
17257,THE REPROOF,Mamma heard me with scorn and pride
17258,THE REPROOF,A wretched beggar boy deride.
17259,THE REPROOF,"""Do you not know,"" said I, ""how mean"
17260,THE REPROOF,It is to be thus begging seen?
17261,THE REPROOF,"If for a week I were not fed,"
17262,THE REPROOF,"I'm sure I would not beg my bread."""
17263,THE REPROOF,And then away she saw me stalk
17264,THE REPROOF,With a most self-important walk.
17265,THE REPROOF,"But meeting her upon the stairs,"
17266,THE REPROOF,All these my consequential airs
17267,THE REPROOF,Were chang'd to an entreating look.
17268,THE REPROOF,"""Give me,"" said I, ""the Pocket Book,"
17269,THE REPROOF,"Mamma, you promis'd I should have."""
17270,THE REPROOF,The Pocket Book to me she gave;
17271,THE REPROOF,"After reproof and counsel sage,"
17272,THE REPROOF,She bade me write in the first page
17273,THE REPROOF,This naughty action all in rhyme;
17274,THE REPROOF,"No food to have until the time,"
17275,THE REPROOF,"In writing fair and neatly worded,"
17276,THE REPROOF,The unfeeling fact I had recorded.
17277,THE REPROOF,"Slow I compose, and slow I write;"
17278,THE REPROOF,And now I feel keen hunger bite.
17279,THE REPROOF,"My mother's pardon I entreat,"
17280,THE REPROOF,And beg she'll give me food to eat.

17287,THE TWO BEES,"But a few words could William say,"
17288,THE TWO BEES,And those few could not speak plain.
17289,THE TWO BEES,Yet thought he was a man one day;
17290,THE TWO BEES,Never saw I a boy so vain.
17291,THE TWO BEES,
17292,THE TWO BEES,From what could vanity proceed
17293,THE TWO BEES,In such a little lisping lad?
17294,THE TWO BEES,Or was it vanity indeed?
17295,THE TWO BEES,Or was he only very glad?
17296,THE TWO BEES,
17297,THE TWO BEES,For he without his maid may go
17298,THE TWO BEES,"To the heath with elder boys,"
17299,THE TWO BEES,And pluck ripe berries where they grow:
17300,THE TWO BEES,Well may William then rejoice.
17301,THE TWO BEES,
17302,THE TWO BEES,Be careful of your little charge;
17303,THE TWO BEES,"Elder boys, let him not rove;"
17304,THE TWO BEES,"The heath is wide, the heath is large,"
17305,THE TWO BEES,From your sight he must not move.
17306,THE TWO BEES,
17307,THE TWO BEES,But rove he did: they had not been
17308,THE TWO BEES,"One short hour the heath upon,"
17309,THE TWO BEES,When he was no where to be seen;
17310,THE TWO BEES,"""Where,"" said they, ""is William gone?"""
17311,THE TWO BEES,
17312,THE TWO BEES,Mind not the elder boys' distress;
17313,THE TWO BEES,"Let them run, and let them fly."
17314,THE TWO BEES,Their own neglect and giddiness
17315,THE TWO BEES,They are justly suffering by.
17316,THE TWO BEES,
17317,THE TWO BEES,William his little basket fill'd
17318,THE TWO BEES,With his berries ripe and red;
17319,THE TWO BEES,"Then, naughty boy, two bees he kill'd,"
17320,THE TWO BEES,Under foot he stamp'd them dead.
17321,THE TWO BEES,
17322,THE TWO BEES,"William had cours'd them o'er the heath,"
17323,THE TWO BEES,After them his steps did wander;
17324,THE TWO BEES,"When he was nearly out of breath,"
17325,THE TWO BEES,The last bee his foot was under.
17326,THE TWO BEES,
17327,THE TWO BEES,"A cruel triumph, which did not"
17328,THE TWO BEES,"Last but for a moment's space,"
17329,THE TWO BEES,For now he finds that he has got
17330,THE TWO BEES,Out of sight of every face.
17331,THE TWO BEES,
17332,THE TWO BEES,What are the berries now to him?
17333,THE TWO BEES,What the bees which he hath slain?
17334,THE TWO BEES,"Fear now possesses every limb,"
17335,THE TWO BEES,He cannot trace his steps again.
17336,THE TWO BEES,
17337,THE TWO BEES,The poor bees William had affrighted
17338,THE TWO BEES,"In more terror did not haste,"
17339,THE TWO BEES,"Than he from bush to bush, benighted"
17340,THE TWO BEES,And alone amid the waste.
17341,THE TWO BEES,
17342,THE TWO BEES,Late in the night the child was found:
17343,THE TWO BEES,He who these two bees had crush'd
17344,THE TWO BEES,"Was lying on the cold damp ground,"
17345,THE TWO BEES,Sleep had then his sorrows hush'd.
17346,THE TWO BEES,
17347,THE TWO BEES,"A fever follow'd from the fright,"
17348,THE TWO BEES,And from sleeping in the dew;
17349,THE TWO BEES,He many a day and many a night
17350,THE TWO BEES,Suffer'd ere he better grew.
17351,THE TWO BEES,
17352,THE TWO BEES,His aching limbs while sick he lay
17353,THE TWO BEES,Made him learn the crush'd bees' pain;

17368,THE JOURNEY FROM SCHOOL AND TO SCHOOL,Or feels the slightest harm?
17369,THE JOURNEY FROM SCHOOL AND TO SCHOOL,
17370,THE JOURNEY FROM SCHOOL AND TO SCHOOL,The dust and sun is life and fun;
17371,THE JOURNEY FROM SCHOOL AND TO SCHOOL,The hot and sultry weather
17372,THE JOURNEY FROM SCHOOL AND TO SCHOOL,"A higher zest gives every breast,"
17373,THE JOURNEY FROM SCHOOL AND TO SCHOOL,Thus jumbled all together.

17380,THE JOURNEY FROM SCHOOL AND TO SCHOOL,"But sad, but sad is every lad"
17381,THE JOURNEY FROM SCHOOL AND TO SCHOOL,"That day on which we come,"

17406,THE ORANGE,THE ORANGE
17407,THE ORANGE,
17408,THE ORANGE,"The month was June, the day was hot,"
17409,THE ORANGE,And Philip had an orange got.
17410,THE ORANGE,"The fruit was fragrant, tempting, bright,"
17411,THE ORANGE,Refreshing to the smell and sight;
17412,THE ORANGE,Not of that puny size which calls
17413,THE ORANGE,"Poor customers to common stalls,"
17414,THE ORANGE,"But large and massy, full of juice,"
17415,THE ORANGE,As any Lima can produce.
17416,THE ORANGE,"The liquor would, if squeezed out,"
17417,THE ORANGE,Have fill'd a tumbler thereabout--
17418,THE ORANGE,
17419,THE ORANGE,"The happy boy, with greedy eyes,"
17420,THE ORANGE,Surveys and re-surveys his prize.
17421,THE ORANGE,"He turns it round, and longs to drain,"
17422,THE ORANGE,And with the juice his lips to stain.
17423,THE ORANGE,His throat and lips were parch'd with heat;
17424,THE ORANGE,"The orange seem'd to cry, _Come eat_."
17425,THE ORANGE,He from his pocket draws a knife--
17426,THE ORANGE,"When in his thoughts there rose a strife,"
17427,THE ORANGE,"Which folks experience when they wish,"
17428,THE ORANGE,"Yet scruple to begin a dish,"
17429,THE ORANGE,And by their hesitation own
17430,THE ORANGE,It is too good to eat alone.
17431,THE ORANGE,But appetite o'er indecision
17432,THE ORANGE,"Prevails, and Philip makes incision."
17433,THE ORANGE,The melting fruit in quarters came--
17434,THE ORANGE,Just then there passed by a dame--
17435,THE ORANGE,"One of the poorer sort she seem'd,"
17436,THE ORANGE,As by her garb you would have deem'd--
17437,THE ORANGE,Who in her toil-worn arms did hold
17438,THE ORANGE,A sickly infant ten months old;
17439,THE ORANGE,"That from a fever, caught in spring,"
17440,THE ORANGE,Was slowly then recovering.
17441,THE ORANGE,"The child, attracted by the view"
17442,THE ORANGE,"Of that fair orange, feebly threw"
17443,THE ORANGE,A languid look--perhaps the smell
17444,THE ORANGE,Convinc'd it that there sure must dwell
17445,THE ORANGE,"A corresponding sweetness there,"
17446,THE ORANGE,Where lodg'd a scent so good and rare--
17447,THE ORANGE,Perhaps the smell the fruit did give
17448,THE ORANGE,Felt healing and restorative--
17449,THE ORANGE,For never had the child been grac'd
17450,THE ORANGE,To know such dainties by their taste.
17451,THE ORANGE,
17452,THE ORANGE,"When Philip saw the infant crave,"
17453,THE ORANGE,He straitway to the mother gave
17454,THE ORANGE,His quarter'd orange; nor would stay
17455,THE ORANGE,"To hear her thanks, but tript away."
17456,THE ORANGE,Then to the next clear spring he ran
17457,THE ORANGE,"To quench his drought, a happy man!"

17494,THE THREE FRIENDS,
17495,THE THREE FRIENDS,(_Text of 1818_)
17496,THE THREE FRIENDS,
17497,THE THREE FRIENDS,Three young maids in friendship met;
17498,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Mary, Martha, Margaret."
17499,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Margaret was tall and fair,"
17500,THE THREE FRIENDS,Martha shorter by a hair;
17501,THE THREE FRIENDS,"If the first excell'd in feature,"
17502,THE THREE FRIENDS,Th' other's grace and ease were greater;
17503,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Mary, though to rival loth,"
17504,THE THREE FRIENDS,In their best gifts equall'd both.
17505,THE THREE FRIENDS,They a due proportion kept;
17506,THE THREE FRIENDS,Martha mourn'd if Margaret wept;
17507,THE THREE FRIENDS,Margaret joy'd when any good
17508,THE THREE FRIENDS,She of Martha understood;
17509,THE THREE FRIENDS,And in sympathy for either
17510,THE THREE FRIENDS,Mary was outdone by neither.
17511,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Thus far, for a happy space,"
17512,THE THREE FRIENDS,"All three ran an even race,"
17513,THE THREE FRIENDS,"A most constant friendship proving,"
17514,THE THREE FRIENDS,Equally belov'd and loving;
17515,THE THREE FRIENDS,"All their wishes, joys, the same;"
17516,THE THREE FRIENDS,Sisters only not in name.
17517,THE THREE FRIENDS,
17518,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Fortune upon each one smil'd,"
17519,THE THREE FRIENDS,As upon a fav'rite child;
17520,THE THREE FRIENDS,Well to do and well to see
17521,THE THREE FRIENDS,Were the parents of all three;
17522,THE THREE FRIENDS,Till on Martha's father crosses
17523,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Brought a flood of worldly losses,"
17524,THE THREE FRIENDS,And his fortunes rich and great
17525,THE THREE FRIENDS,Chang'd at once to low estate;
17526,THE THREE FRIENDS,Under which o'erwhelming blow
17527,THE THREE FRIENDS,Martha's mother was laid low;
17528,THE THREE FRIENDS,"She a hapless orphan left,"
17529,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Of maternal care bereft,"
17530,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Trouble following trouble fast,"
17531,THE THREE FRIENDS,Lay in a sick bed at last.
17532,THE THREE FRIENDS,
17533,THE THREE FRIENDS,In the depth of her affliction
17534,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Martha now receiv'd conviction,"
17535,THE THREE FRIENDS,That a true and faithful friend
17536,THE THREE FRIENDS,Can the surest comfort lend.
17537,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Night and day, with friendship tried,"
17538,THE THREE FRIENDS,Ever constant by her side
17539,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Was her gentle Mary found,"
17540,THE THREE FRIENDS,With a love that knew no bound;
17541,THE THREE FRIENDS,And the solace she imparted
17542,THE THREE FRIENDS,Sav'd her dying' broken-hearted.
17543,THE THREE FRIENDS,
17544,THE THREE FRIENDS,In this scene of earthly things
17545,THE THREE FRIENDS,Not one good unmixed springs.
17546,THE THREE FRIENDS,That which had to Martha proved
17547,THE THREE FRIENDS,"A sweet consolation, moved"
17548,THE THREE FRIENDS,Different feelings of regret
17549,THE THREE FRIENDS,In the mind of Margaret.
17550,THE THREE FRIENDS,"She, whose love was not less dear,"
17551,THE THREE FRIENDS,Nor affection less sincere
17552,THE THREE FRIENDS,"To her friend, was, by occasion"
17553,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Of more distant habitation,"
17554,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Fewer visits forc'd to pay her,"
17555,THE THREE FRIENDS,When no other cause did stay her;
17556,THE THREE FRIENDS,"And her Mary living nearer,"
17557,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Margaret began to fear her,"
17558,THE THREE FRIENDS,Lest her visits day by day
17559,THE THREE FRIENDS,Martha's heart should steal away.
17560,THE THREE FRIENDS,"That whole heart she ill could spare her,"
17561,THE THREE FRIENDS,Where till now she'd been a sharer.
17562,THE THREE FRIENDS,"From this cause with grief she pined,"
17563,THE THREE FRIENDS,Till at length her health declined.
17564,THE THREE FRIENDS,"All her chearful spirits flew,"
17565,THE THREE FRIENDS,Fast as Martha gather'd new;
17566,THE THREE FRIENDS,"And her sickness waxed sore,"
17567,THE THREE FRIENDS,Just when Martha felt no more.
17568,THE THREE FRIENDS,
17569,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Mary, who had quick suspicion"
17570,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Of her alter'd friend's condition,"
17571,THE THREE FRIENDS,Seeing Martha's convalescence
17572,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Less demanded now her presence,"
17573,THE THREE FRIENDS,"With a goodness, built on reason,"
17574,THE THREE FRIENDS,Chang'd her measures with the season;
17575,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Turn'd her steps from Martha's door,"
17576,THE THREE FRIENDS,Went where she was wanted more;
17577,THE THREE FRIENDS,All her care and thoughts were set
17578,THE THREE FRIENDS,Now to tend on Margaret.
17579,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Mary living 'twixt the two,"
17580,THE THREE FRIENDS,"From her home could oft'ner go,"
17581,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Either of her friends to see,"
17582,THE THREE FRIENDS,Than they could together be.
17583,THE THREE FRIENDS,
17584,THE THREE FRIENDS,Truth explain'd is to suspicion
17585,THE THREE FRIENDS,Evermore the best physician.
17586,THE THREE FRIENDS,Soon her visits had the effect;
17587,THE THREE FRIENDS,"All that Margaret did suspect,"
17588,THE THREE FRIENDS,From her fancy vanish'd clean;
17589,THE THREE FRIENDS,"She was soon what she had been,"
17590,THE THREE FRIENDS,And the colour she did lack
17591,THE THREE FRIENDS,To her faded cheek came back.
17592,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Wounds which love had made her feel,"
17593,THE THREE FRIENDS,Love alone had power to heal.
17594,THE THREE FRIENDS,
17595,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Martha, who the frequent visit"
17596,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Now had lost, and sore did miss it,"
17597,THE THREE FRIENDS,"With impatience waxed cross,"
17598,THE THREE FRIENDS,Counted Margaret's gain her loss:
17599,THE THREE FRIENDS,All that Mary did confer
17600,THE THREE FRIENDS,"On her friend, thought due to her."
17601,THE THREE FRIENDS,In her girlish bosom rise
17602,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Little foolish jealousies,"
17603,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Which into such rancour wrought,"
17604,THE THREE FRIENDS,She one day for Margaret sought;
17605,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Finding her by chance alone,"
17606,THE THREE FRIENDS,"She began, with reasons shown,"
17607,THE THREE FRIENDS,To insinuate a fear
17608,THE THREE FRIENDS,Whether Mary was sincere;
17609,THE THREE FRIENDS,Wish'd that Margaret would take heed
17610,THE THREE FRIENDS,Whence her actions did proceed.
17611,THE THREE FRIENDS,"For herself, she'd long been minded"
17612,THE THREE FRIENDS,Not with outsides to be blinded;
17613,THE THREE FRIENDS,"All that pity and compassion,"
17614,THE THREE FRIENDS,She believ'd was affectation;
17615,THE THREE FRIENDS,In her heart she doubted whether
17616,THE THREE FRIENDS,Mary car'd a pin for either.
17617,THE THREE FRIENDS,"She could keep whole weeks at distance,"
17618,THE THREE FRIENDS,"And not know of their existence,"
17619,THE THREE FRIENDS,While all things remain'd the same;
17620,THE THREE FRIENDS,"But, when some misfortune came,"
17621,THE THREE FRIENDS,Then she made a great parade
17622,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Of her sympathy and aid,--"
17623,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Not that she did really grieve,"
17624,THE THREE FRIENDS,"It was only _make-believe_,"
17625,THE THREE FRIENDS,"And she car'd for nothing, so"
17626,THE THREE FRIENDS,"She might her fine feelings shew,"
17627,THE THREE FRIENDS,"And get credit, on her part,"

17702,THE THREE FRIENDS,Kindly eas'd them of their shame;
17703,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Spoke to them with accents bland,"
17704,THE THREE FRIENDS,Took them friendly by the hand;
17705,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Bound them both with promise fast,"
17706,THE THREE FRIENDS,Not to speak of troubles past;
17707,THE THREE FRIENDS,Made them on the spot declare
17708,THE THREE FRIENDS,A new league of friendship there;
17709,THE THREE FRIENDS,"Which, without a word of strife,"
17710,THE THREE FRIENDS,Lasted thenceforth long as life.

18360,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Give this ignorant babble o'er,"
18361,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Nor with little female pride
18362,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Things above your sense deride.
18363,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Why this foolish under-rating
18364,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Of my first attempts at Latin?
18365,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Know you not each thing we prize
18366,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Does from small beginnings rise?
18367,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"'Twas the same thing with your writing,"
18368,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Which you now take such delight in.
18369,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"First you learnt the down-stroke line,"
18370,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Then the hair-stroke thin and fine,"
18371,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Then a curve, and then a better,"
18372,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Till you came to form a letter;
18373,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Then a new task was begun,"
18374,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,How to join them two in one;
18375,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Till you got (these first steps past)
18376,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,To your fine text-hand at last.
18377,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,So though I at first commence
18378,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"With the humble accidence,"
18379,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,And my study's course affords
18380,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Little else as yet but words,"
18381,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,I shall venture in a while
18382,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"At construction, grammar, style,"
18383,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Learn my syntax, and proceed"
18384,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Classic authors next to read,"
18385,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Such as wiser, better, make us,"
18386,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Sallust, Phædrus, Ovid, Flaccus:"
18387,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"All the poets (with their wit),"
18388,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"All the grave historians writ,"
18389,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Who the lives and actions show
18390,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Of men famous long ago;
18391,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Ev'n their very sayings giving
18392,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,In the tongue they us'd when living.
18393,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,
18394,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Think not I shall do that wrong
18395,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Either to my native tongue,"
18396,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"English authors to despise,"
18397,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Or those books which you so prize;
18398,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Though from them awhile I stray,"
18399,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"By new studies call'd away,"
18400,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Them when next I take in hand,"
18401,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,I shall better understand.
18402,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,For I've heard wise men declare
18403,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Many words in English are
18404,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"From the Latin tongue deriv'd,"
18405,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,Of whose sense girls are depriv'd
18406,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,'Cause they do not Latin know.--
18407,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,But if all this anger grow
18408,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"From this cause, that you suspect"
18409,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"By proceedings indirect,"
18410,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,I would keep (as misers pelf)
18411,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,All this learning to myself;
18412,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Sister, to remove this doubt,"
18413,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,"Rather than we will fall out,"
18414,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,(If our parents will agree)
18415,THE BROTHER'S REPLY,You shall Latin learn with me.

19518,DAVID,This found Goliath huge and tall:
19519,DAVID,"Mightiest giant of them all,"
19520,DAVID,Who in the proud Philistian host
19521,DAVID,Defied Israel with boast.
19522,DAVID,
19523,DAVID,With loud voice Goliath said:
19524,DAVID,"""Hear, armed Israel, gathered,"
19525,DAVID,And in array against us set:

19534,DAVID,"But if I prove the victor, then"
19535,DAVID,Shall Saul and all his armed men
19536,DAVID,"Bend low beneath Philistian yoke."""
19537,DAVID,"Day by day these words he spoke,"
19538,DAVID,Singly traversing the ground.
19539,DAVID,But not an Israelite was found
19540,DAVID,"To combat man to man with him,"
19541,DAVID,Who such prodigious force of limb
19542,DAVID,Display'd. Like to a weaver's beam
19543,DAVID,The pond'rous spear he held did seem.
19544,DAVID,"In height six cubits he did pass,"
19545,DAVID,And he was arm'd all o'er in brass.
19546,DAVID,
19547,DAVID,Him we will leave awhile--and speak
19548,DAVID,"Of one, the soft down on whose cheek"
19549,DAVID,Of tender youth the tokens bare.
19550,DAVID,Ruddy he was and very fair.
19551,DAVID,"David, the son of Jesse he,"
19552,DAVID,"Small-siz'd, yet beautiful to see."
19553,DAVID,Three brothers had he in the band
19554,DAVID,Of warriors under Saul's command;
19555,DAVID,Himself at home did private keep
19556,DAVID,In Bethlem's plains his father's sheep.
19557,DAVID,
19558,DAVID,Jesse said to this his son:

19562,DAVID,"These presents for their captains take,"
19563,DAVID,"And of their fare inquiries make."""
19564,DAVID,With joy the youth his sire obey'd.--

19566,DAVID,When he arrived at the place
19567,DAVID,Where he beheld the strength and face
19568,DAVID,"Of dread Goliath, and could hear"
19569,DAVID,The challenge. Of the people near
19570,DAVID,"Unmov'd he ask'd, what should be done"
19571,DAVID,"To him who slew that boasting one,"
19572,DAVID,Whose words such mischiefs did forebode
19573,DAVID,To th' armies of the living God?
19574,DAVID,
19575,DAVID,"""The king,"" they unto David say,"
19576,DAVID,"""Most amply will that man repay,"
19577,DAVID,He and his father's house shall be
19578,DAVID,Evermore in Israel free.
19579,DAVID,With mighty wealth Saul will endow
19580,DAVID,That man: and he has made a vow;
19581,DAVID,"Whoever takes Goliath's life,"
19582,DAVID,"Shall have Saul's daughter for his wife."""
19583,DAVID,
19584,DAVID,"His eldest brother, who had heard"
19585,DAVID,"His question, was to anger stirr'd"
19586,DAVID,Against the youth: for (as he thought)
19587,DAVID,Things out of his young reach he sought.
19588,DAVID,"Said he, ""What mov'd thee to come here,"
19589,DAVID,"To question warlike men? say, where"
19590,DAVID,"And in whose care are those few sheep,"
19591,DAVID,That in the wilderness you keep?
19592,DAVID,"I know thy thoughts, how proud thou art:"
19593,DAVID,"In the naughtiness of thy heart,"
19594,DAVID,"Hoping a battle thou mayst see,"
19595,DAVID,"Thou comest hither down to me."""
19596,DAVID,
19597,DAVID,Then answer'd Jesse's youngest son
19598,DAVID,"In these words: ""What have I done?"
19599,DAVID,"Is there not cause?"" Some there which heard,"
19600,DAVID,And at the manner of his word
19601,DAVID,"Admir'd, report this to the king."
19602,DAVID,By his command they David bring
19603,DAVID,"Into his presence. Fearless then,"
19604,DAVID,"Before the king and his chief men,"
19605,DAVID,He shews his confident design
19606,DAVID,To combat with the Philistine.
19607,DAVID,"Saul with wonder heard the youth,"
19608,DAVID,"And thus address'd him: ""Of a truth,"
19609,DAVID,No pow'r thy untried sinew hath
19610,DAVID,"To cope with this great man of Gath."""
19611,DAVID,
19612,DAVID,"Lowly David bow'd his head,"
19613,DAVID,And with firm voice the stripling said:
19614,DAVID,"""Thy servant kept his father's sheep.--"
19615,DAVID,Rushing from a mountain steep
19616,DAVID,"There came a lion, and a bear,"
19617,DAVID,The firstlings of my flock to tear.
19618,DAVID,"Thy servant hath that lion kill'd,"
19619,DAVID,"And kill'd that bear, when from the field"
19620,DAVID,Two young lambs by force they seiz'd.
19621,DAVID,The Lord was mercifully pleas'd
19622,DAVID,Me to deliver from the paw
19623,DAVID,"Of the fierce bear, and cruel jaw"
19624,DAVID,Of the strong lion. I shall slay
19625,DAVID,"Th' unrighteous Philistine this day,"
19626,DAVID,If God deliver him also
19627,DAVID,"To me."" He ceas'd. The king said, ""Go:"
19628,DAVID,"Thy God, the God of Israel, be"
19629,DAVID,"In the battle still with thee."""
19630,DAVID,
19631,DAVID,"David departs, unarmed, save"
19632,DAVID,A staff in hand he chanc'd to have.
19633,DAVID,"Nothing to the fight he took,"
19634,DAVID,Save five smooth stones from out a brook;
19635,DAVID,"These in his shepherd's scrip he plac'd,"
19636,DAVID,That was fasten'd round his waist.
19637,DAVID,With staff and sling alone he meets
19638,DAVID,"The armed giant, who him greets"
19639,DAVID,With nought but scorn. Looking askance
19640,DAVID,On the fair ruddy countenance
19641,DAVID,"Of his young enemy--""Am I"
19642,DAVID,"A dog, that thou com'st here to try"
19643,DAVID,"Thy strength upon me with a staff--?"""
19644,DAVID,Goliath said with scornful laugh.
19645,DAVID,"""Thou com'st with sword, with spear, with shield,"
19646,DAVID,Yet thou to me this day must yield.
19647,DAVID,"The Lord of Hosts is on my side,"
19648,DAVID,Whose armies boastful thou'st defied.
19649,DAVID,All nations of the earth shall hear
19650,DAVID,"He saveth not with shield and spear."""
19651,DAVID,
19652,DAVID,"Thus David spake, and nigher went,"
19653,DAVID,"Then chusing from his scrip, he sent"
19654,DAVID,Out of his slender sling a stone.--
19655,DAVID,The giant utter'd fearful moan.
19656,DAVID,The stone though small had pierced deep
19657,DAVID,"Into his forehead, endless sleep"
19658,DAVID,Giving Goliath--and thus died
19659,DAVID,Of Philistines the strength and pride.

19893,A POETICAL VERSION OF AN ANCIENT TALK,"That length of nose portended length of days,"

19924,A POETICAL VERSION OF AN ANCIENT TALK,Whate'er on human life distinction throws--
19925,A POETICAL VERSION OF AN ANCIENT TALK,Was all comprised--in what?--a length of nose!

20083,FAIRY,"And held it want of manners in the Dame,"
20084,FAIRY,And did her country education blame.
20085,FAIRY,"One thing he only wonder'd at,--what she"
20086,FAIRY,So very comic in his nose could see.
20087,FAIRY,"Hers, it must be confest, was somewhat short,"
20088,FAIRY,And time and shrinking age accounted for't;
20089,FAIRY,"But for his own, thank heaven, he could not tell"
20090,FAIRY,That it was ever thought remarkable;
20091,FAIRY,"A decent nose, of reasonable size,"
20092,FAIRY,"And handsome thought, rather than otherwise."
20093,FAIRY,"But that which most of all his wonder paid,"
20094,FAIRY,Was to observe the Fairy's waiting Maid;
20095,FAIRY,How at each word the aged Dame let fall
20096,FAIRY,"She courtsied low, and smil'd assent to all;"
20097,FAIRY,But chiefly when the rev'rend Grannam told
20098,FAIRY,"Of conquests, which her beauty made of old.--"
20099,FAIRY,"He smiled to see how Flattery sway'd the Dame,"
20100,FAIRY,Nor knew himself was open to the same!
20101,FAIRY,"He finds her raillery now increase so fast,"
20102,FAIRY,"That making hasty end of his repast,"
20103,FAIRY,"Glad to escape her tongue, he bids farewell"
20104,FAIRY,"To the old Fairy, and her friendly cell."
20105,FAIRY,
20106,FAIRY,"But his kind Hostess, who had vainly tried"
20107,FAIRY,"The force of ridicule to cure his pride,"
20108,FAIRY,"Fertile in plans, a surer method chose,"
20109,FAIRY,To make him see the error of his nose;
20110,FAIRY,"For till he view'd that feature with remorse,"
20111,FAIRY,The Enchanter's direful spell must be in force.
20112,FAIRY,
20113,FAIRY,"Midway the road by which the Prince must pass,"
20114,FAIRY,She rais'd by magic art a House of Glass;
20115,FAIRY,"No mason's hand appear'd, nor work of wood;"
20116,FAIRY,Compact of glass the wondrous fabric stood.
20117,FAIRY,"Its stately pillars, glittering in the sun,"
20118,FAIRY,"Conspicuous from afar, like silver, shone."
20119,FAIRY,"Here, snatch'd and rescued from th' Enchanter's might,"
20120,FAIRY,She placed the beauteous Claribel in sight.
20121,FAIRY,"The admiring Prince the chrystal dome survey'd,"
20122,FAIRY,And sought access unto his lovely Maid;
20123,FAIRY,"But, strange to tell, in all that mansion's bound,"
20124,FAIRY,"Nor door, nor casement, was there to be found."
20125,FAIRY,"Enrag'd, he took up massy stones, and flung"
20126,FAIRY,"With such a force, that all the palace rung;"
20127,FAIRY,"But made no more impression on the glass,"
20128,FAIRY,Than if the solid structure had been brass.
20129,FAIRY,"To comfort his despair, the lovely maid"
20130,FAIRY,Her snowy hand against her window laid;
20131,FAIRY,"But when with eager haste he thought to kiss,"
20132,FAIRY,"His Nose stood out, and robb'd him of the bliss."
20133,FAIRY,Thrice he essay'd th' impracticable feat;
20134,FAIRY,The window and his lips can never meet.
20135,FAIRY,
20136,FAIRY,"The painful Truth, which Flattery long conceal'd,"
20137,FAIRY,"Rush'd on his mind, and ""O!"" he cried, ""I yield;"
20138,FAIRY,"Wisest of Fairies, thou wert right, I wrong--"
20139,FAIRY,"_I own, I own, I have a Nose too long_."""
20140,FAIRY,
20141,FAIRY,"The frank confession was no sooner spoke,"
20142,FAIRY,"But into shivers all the palace broke,"
20143,FAIRY,"His Nose of monstrous length, to his surprise"
20144,FAIRY,Shrunk to the limits of a common size;
20145,FAIRY,"And Claribel with joy her Lover view'd,"
20146,FAIRY,Now grown as beautiful as he was good.

20149,FAIRY,"The Prince with rapture hails the happy hour,"

20160,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20161,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20162,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,Charles Lamb's activities as a writer for children seem to have begun
20163,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,and ended in the service of Godwin. The earliest effort in this
20164,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,direction of which we have any knowledge is _The King and Queen of
20165,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Hearts_, 1805, and the latest _Prince Dorus_, 1810 or 1811, unless we"
20166,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"count _Beauty and the Beast_, possibly 1811, which in my opinion he"
20167,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,did not write.
20168,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20169,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Lamb first met William Godwin (1756-1836), the philosopher, probably"
20170,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"through the instrumentality of their mutual friend Thomas Holcroft,"
20171,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"not long after Gillray had satirised Lamb and Lloyd, in his plate in"
20172,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"the first number of _The Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine_, August,"
20173,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"1798, as a frog and a toad, seated in the vicinity of Coleridge and"
20174,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Southey and reading together a volume labelled ""Blank Verse, by Toad"
20175,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"and Frog."" ""Pray, Mr. Lamb,"" said Godwin when he first made Lamb's"
20176,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"acquaintance, ""are you toad or frog?"" It was feared that trouble might"
20177,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"ensue, but Lamb and Godwin were found the next morning at breakfast"
20178,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"together and they became good, though never very intimate, friends."
20179,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20180,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Godwin, who had been for a while a minister at Ware, in Hertfordshire,"
20181,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"came to London in 1779, and took up literature as a profession"
20182,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"seriously in 1783. His _Political Justice_ was published in 1793,"
20183,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"_Caleb Williams_ in 1794, and _St. Leon_ in 1799. After loving at"
20184,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"a distance Mrs. Opie and Mrs. Inchbald, Godwin married Mary"
20185,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Wollstonecraft in 1797. Their daughter afterwards became Mrs. Shelley,"
20186,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,the wife of the poet. Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin died in the year of
20187,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"her marriage, and in 1801 Godwin married again, a Mrs. Clairmont,"
20188,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,a widow. Lamb detested her. None the less it was she who took to
20189,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,publishing and who incited him and his sister to write the charming
20190,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,children's books in this volume.
20191,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20192,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,Lamb helped Godwin with other literary ventures before the publishing
20193,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,business was started. In 1800 he wrote an epilogue to his tragedy
20194,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"of ""Antonio"" (see the essay in Vol. II., ""The Old Actors,"" for a"
20195,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"description of the luckless first night), and he advised him in the"
20196,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"composition of ""Faulkener,"" another tragedy, which failed in 1807 and"
20197,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,which also had a prologue by Lamb. And a letter is extant showing Lamb
20198,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"toiling at a review of Godwin's _Chaucer_ in 1803, but the review"
20199,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,itself is not forthcoming.
20200,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20201,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,The publishing business was started in 1805 on Mrs. Godwin's
20202,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"initiative. At first, owing to the undesirability of connecting the"
20203,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,name of a political and moral firebrand like Godwin with books for
20204,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"children, it was arranged that the business, which was in Hanway"
20205,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Street, Oxford Street, should bear the name of the manager, Thomas"
20206,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Hodgkins, while the books contributed by Godwin were to be signed"
20207,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Edward Baldwin. In 1806, however, Mrs. Godwin opened a shop at 41"
20208,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Skinner Street, Snow Hill (now demolished), and published in her own"
20209,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"name as M.J. Godwin & Co., at The Children's Library."
20210,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20211,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,For her the Lambs wrote _The King and Queen of Hearts_ (by Charles
20212,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Lamb), 1805; _Tales from Shakespear_, 1807; _The Adventures of"
20213,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Ulysses_ (by Charles Lamb), 1808; _Mrs. Leicester's School and Poetry"
20214,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"for Children_, 1809; and _Prince Dorus_ (by Charles Lamb), 1811. Mrs."
20215,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Godwin translated tales from the French, Godwin contributed _Baldwin's"
20216,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Fables_, _Baldwin's Pantheon_, and histories of Greece, England and"
20217,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Rome, and Hazlitt wrote an English Grammar. The principal illustrator"
20218,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,to the firm was William Mulready.
20219,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20220,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Although Lamb had the most cordial disliking for Mrs. Godwin, he"
20221,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,always stood by his old friend her husband. Between 1811 and 1821
20222,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,the two men seem to have had little to do with each other; but in
20223,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,1822 Lamb came to Godwin's assistance to much purpose. The title to
20224,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,Godwin's house in Skinner Street was successfully contested in that
20225,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"year, and Godwin became a bankrupt. A fund was therefore set on"
20226,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"foot for him by Lamb and others, Lamb's own contribution being £50."
20227,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Godwin, however, never rightly rallied, and thenceforward lived very"
20228,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"quietly, wrote the _History of the Commonwealth_ and _Lives of the"
20229,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Necromancers_, and died in 1836. Mrs. Godwin survived him until 1841."
20230,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20231,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,Knowing what we do--from Dowden's _Shelley_ and other sources--it is
20232,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"not possible greatly to admire Godwin's character, nor is the second"
20233,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,Mrs. Godwin a subject for enthusiasm; but the part played by them in
20234,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"the Lambs' literary life was extremely valuable. Charles Lamb had,"
20235,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"it is true, other stimulus, and without his work for children, sweet"
20236,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"though it is, his name would still be a household word; but Mary Lamb"
20237,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"might, but for the Godwins, have gone almost silent to the grave. Her"
20238,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"writings, with their sweet gravity and tender simplicity, were called"
20239,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"forth wholly by the Bad Baby, as Lamb called Mrs. Godwin."
20240,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20241,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,Lamb's views on the literature of the nursery had crystallised long
20242,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,before he began to write children's books himself. In a letter to
20243,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Coleridge, October 23,1802, he had said:--"
20244,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20245,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"""'Goody Two Shoes' is almost out of print. Mrs. Barbauld's stuff has"
20246,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,banished all the old classics of the nursery; and the shopman at
20247,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,Newberry's hardly deigned to reach them off an old exploded corner
20248,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"of a shelf, when Mary asked for them. Mrs. B.'s and Mrs. Trimmer's"
20249,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,nonsense lay in piles about. Knowledge insignificant and vapid as Mrs.
20250,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Barbauld's books convey, it seems, must come to a child in the _shape"
20251,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"of knowledge_, and his empty noddle must be turned with conceit of his"
20252,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"own powers when he has learnt, that a horse is an animal, and Billy is"
20253,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"better than a horse, and such like; instead of that beautiful interest"
20254,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"in wild tales, which made the child a man, while all the while he"
20255,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,suspected himself to be no bigger than a child. Science has succeeded
20256,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,to poetry no less in the little walks of children than with men. Is
20257,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,there no possibility of averting this sore evil? Think what you would
20258,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"have been now, if, instead of being fed with tales and old wives'"
20259,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"fables in childhood, you had been crammed with geography and natural"
20260,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"history!"""
20261,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20262,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,Hence when the time came Lamb was all ready with a nursery method of
20263,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,his own.

20268,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20269,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Mary Lamb was asked to write the _Tales from Shakespear_, with help"
20270,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"from her brother, in the spring of 1806 or the winter of 1805. I have"
20271,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"seen the statement that this was at the instigation of Hazlitt, but"
20272,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,Lamb does not say so. The first mention of the work is in Lamb's
20273,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"letter to Manning, May 10, 1806:--"
20274,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20275,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"""She [Mary] says you saw her writings about the other day, and she"
20276,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,wishes you should know what they are. She is doing for Godwin's
20277,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"bookseller twenty of Shakspeare's plays, to be made into children's"
20278,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"tales. Six are already done by her, to wit, 'The Tempest,' 'Winter's"
20279,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Tale,' 'Midsummer Night,' 'Much Ado,' 'Two Gentlemen of Verona,' and"
20280,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,'Cymbeline'; and the 'Merchant of Venice' is in forwardness. I have
20281,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"done 'Othello' and 'Macbeth,' and mean to do all the tragedies. I"
20282,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"think it will be popular among the little people, besides money. It's"
20283,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"to bring in sixty guineas. Mary has done them capitally, I think,"
20284,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"you'd think. These are the humble amusements we propose, while you are"
20285,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,gone to plant the cross of Christ among barbarous pagan anthropophagi.
20286,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Quam homo homini præstat! but then, perhaps, you'll get murdered, and"
20287,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"we shall die in our beds with a fair literary reputation."""
20288,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20289,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Mary Lamb's letters to Sarah Stoddart (afterwards Sarah Hazlitt),"
20290,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"continue the story. This is on June 2, 1806:--"
20291,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20292,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"My _Tales_ are to be published in separate story-books; I mean, in"
20293,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"single stories, like the children's little shilling books. I cannot"
20294,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"send you them in Manuscript, because they are all in the Godwins'"
20295,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"hands; but one will be published very soon, and then you shall have"
20296,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"it _all in print_. I go on very well, and have no doubt but I shall"
20297,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,always be able to hit upon some such kind of job to keep going on. I
20298,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,think I shall get fifty pounds a year at the lowest calculation; but
20299,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"as I have not yet seen any _money_ of my own earning, for we do not"
20300,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"expect to be paid till Christmas, I do not feel the good fortune, that"
20301,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"has so unexpectedly befallen me, half so much as I ought to do. But"
20302,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"another year, no doubt, I shall perceive it."
20303,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20304,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"When I write again, you will hear tidings of the farce, for Charles is"
20305,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,to go in a few days to the Managers to inquire about it. But that must
20306,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"now be a next-year's business too, even if it does succeed; so it's"
20307,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"all looking forward, and no prospect of present gain. But that's"
20308,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"better than no hopes at all, either for present or future times."
20309,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20310,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Charles has written Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, and has begun Hamlet;"
20311,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"you would like to see us, as we often sit writing on one table (but"
20312,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"not on one cushion sitting), like Hermia and Helena in the Midsummer"
20313,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Night's Dream; or, rather, like an old literary Darby and Joan: I"
20314,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"taking snuff; and he groaning all the while, and saying he can make"
20315,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"nothing of it, which he always says till he has finished, and then he"
20316,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,finds out he has made something of it....
20317,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20318,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,Martin [Burney] has just been here. My Tales (_again_) and Charles's
20319,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Farce has made the boy mad to turn Author; and he has written a Farce,"
20320,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,and he has made the Winter's Tale into a story; but what Charles says
20321,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"of himself is really true of Martin, for _he can make nothing at all"
20322,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"of it_; and I have been talking very eloquently this morning, to"
20323,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"convince him that nobody can write farces, &c., under thirty years of"
20324,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,age. And so I suppose he will go home and new model his farce.
20325,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20326,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"A little later, June 26, Lamb writes to Wordsworth:--"
20327,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20328,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"""Mary is just stuck fast in All's Well that Ends Well. She complains"
20329,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,of having to set forth so many female characters in boy's clothes. She
20330,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,begins to think Shakspear must have wanted Imagination. I to encourage
20331,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"her, for she often faints in the prosecution of her great work,"
20332,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,flatter her with telling how well such and such a play is done. But
20333,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"she is stuck fast and I have been obliged to promise to assist her."""
20334,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20335,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Then we have Mary Lamb to Sarah Stoddart again (early in July, 1806):"
20336,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"""I am in good spirits just at this present time, for Charles has been"
20337,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"reading over the _Tale_ I told you plagued me so much, and he thinks"
20338,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"it one of the very best: it is 'All's Well that Ends Well.'"""
20339,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20340,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,The work was finished in the autumn of 1806 and published at the end
20341,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"of the year, dated 1807. Lamb sent Wordsworth a copy on January 29,"
20342,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"1807, with the following letter:--"
20343,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
20344,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"""We have book'd off from Swan and Two Necks, Lad Lane, this day"
20345,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,(per Coach) the Tales from Shakespear. You will forgive the

20347,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"who left the choice of subjects to the bad baby, who from mischief"
20348,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,(I suppose) has chosen one from damn'd beastly vulgarity (vide
20349,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"'Merch. Venice'), where no atom of authority was in the tale to"
20350,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,justify it--to another has given a name which exists not in the
20351,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"tale, Nic Bottom, and which she thought would be funny, though in"
20352,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"this I suspect _his_ hand, for I guess her reading does not reach"
20353,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"far enough to know Bottom's Christian name--and one of Hamlet, and"
20354,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Grave digging, a scene which is not hinted at in the story, and"
20355,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,you might as well have put King Canute the Great reproving his
20356,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"courtiers--the rest are Giants and Giantesses. Suffice it, to save"
20357,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"our taste and damn our folly, that we left it all to a friend W.G."
20358,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"who in the first place cheated me into putting a name to them,"
20359,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"which I did not mean, but do not repent, and then wrote a puff"
20360,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"about their _simplicity_, &c., to go with the advertisement as in"
20361,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,my name! Enough of this egregious dupery. I will try to abstract
20362,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,the load of teazing circumstances from the Stories and tell you

20364,CHARLES LAMB AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN,"Othello, for occasionally a tail piece or correction of grammar,"

20413,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,The Proprietors of this work willingly pay obedience to the voice
20414,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"of the public. It has been the general sentiment, that the style"
20415,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"in which these Tales are written, is not so precisely adapted for"
20416,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"the amusement of mere children, as for an acceptable and improving"
20417,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,present to young ladies advancing to the state of womanhood.
20418,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,They therefore now offer to the public an edition prepared with
20419,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,suitable elegance. In the former impression they gave twenty
20420,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"prints, illustrative of the twenty tales which compose these"
20421,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"volumes, for they knew that it was a grievous thing and a"
20422,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"disappointment to a child, to find some tales without the"
20423,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"recommendation of a print, which the others possessed. The prints"
20424,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"were therefore made from spirited designs, but did not pretend to"
20425,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,high finishing in the execution. To this edition they have annexed
20426,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"merely a beautiful head of our immortal Dramatist, from a much"
20427,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,admired painting by Zoust.--They are satisfied that every reader
20428,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"of taste will thank them for not suppressing the former Preface,"

20436,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Lamb, we may be sure, had no hand in this manifesto, but whatever"
20437,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,protest he may have made was unsuccessful. It reappears in the third

20439,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"first person singular to the first person plural: ""our young readers"""
20440,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"for ""my young readers,"" and so forth. But this was probably Godwinian"

20442,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,
20443,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,The Godwins also issued some or all of the _Tales_ separately at
20444,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,sixpence each (the two ordinary volumes cost eight shillings) with
20445,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"three plates to each, of a different design from those in the"
20446,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"two-volume edition. These little books are exceedingly rare, but"
20447,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,copies have been discovered both plain and coloured. The plates are
20448,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,attributed to Blake.

20454,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"did not, however, borrow anything from M. Perrin, even if they were"

20456,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,
20457,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"The _Tales from Shakespear_ are, and probably will continue to be,"
20458,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,the most widely distributed of all the Lambs' work. In England it may
20459,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,be that _Elia_ has had as many readers; but abroad the _Tales from
20460,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,Shakespear_ easily lead. In the British Museum catalogue I find
20461,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"translations in French, German, Swedish, Spanish, and Polish. (No"
20462,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"complete translation of _Elia_ into any language is known, not even in"
20463,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"French, although a selection of the essays will be found at the end of"
20464,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Depret's monograph, _De L'Humeur Littéraire en Angleterre_, 1877.) In"
20465,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,England almost every Christmas brings a new edition of the _Tales_ and

20472,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"attributed to Charles Lamb, presumably against his wish, as we see"
20473,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"from a sentence in the letter to Wordsworth quoted above, and the"
20474,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,other two books had no name attached to them at all. Why Mary Lamb
20475,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,preserved such strict anonymity we do not now know; but it was
20476,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,probably from a natural shrinking from any kind of publicity after the
20477,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,unhappy publicity which she had once gained by her misfortune.

20528,WILLIAM GODWIN TO CHARLES LAMB,
20529,WILLIAM GODWIN TO CHARLES LAMB,It is strange with what different feelings an author and
20530,WILLIAM GODWIN TO CHARLES LAMB,a bookseller looks at the same manuscript. I know this by
20531,WILLIAM GODWIN TO CHARLES LAMB,"experience: I was an author, I am a bookseller. The author thinks"

20574,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"up the six men, etc.,--that is to say, they are lively images of"
20575,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"_shocking_ things. If you want a book, which is not occasionally"
20576,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"to _shock_, you should not have thought of a tale which was so"
20577,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,full of anthropophagi and wonders. I cannot alter these things

20580,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"refuse it. But speaking as author to author, I must say that I"

20582,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"preponderate over the nauseous, as to make them rather fine than"

20584,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,reads Tales of Terror and Mysteries of Udolpho? Such things sell.
20585,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"I only say that I will not consent to alter such passages, which"

20593,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"As the reader will see, Lamb made only the one alteration; nor did he"

20596,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"I have set up _The Adventures of Ulysses_ from the second edition,"

20603,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"inserted after ""keep."""
20604,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20605,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"The suggestion has been made that, since Lamb states in the preface"
20606,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,that this work was designed as a supplement to _The Adventures
20607,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"of Telemachus_, he was also the author of one of the versions of"
20608,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Fénélon's popular tale. But this, I think, has no foundation in fact."
20609,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,We know from Lamb's letter to Godwin that the impulse to write _The
20610,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Adventures of Ulysses_ came from Godwin, and it was natural that he,"
20611,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"a bookseller, should wish to associate this new venture with a volume"
20612,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,so well known and so acceptable as the _Telemachus_. Now and then in

20615,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20616,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"""It were useless to describe over again what has been so well told"
20617,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,already; or to relate those soft arts of courtship which the goddess
20618,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,used to detain Ulysses; the same in kind which she afterwards
20619,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"practised upon his less wary son, whom Minerva, in the shape of"
20620,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Mentor, hardly preserved from her snares when they came to the"
20621,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Delightful Island together in search of the scarce departed Ulysses."""
20622,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20623,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"This is drawn not from Chapman or Homer, but from the Archbishop of"
20624,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Cambrai. Lamb introduced it in accordance with the first sentence of
20625,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,his preface.
20626,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20627,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Lamb adapted Chapman very freely. For the material in Chapter I. we
20628,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"must go to Chapman, Books IX. and X.; for Chapter II., to Books X."
20629,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"and XL; for Chapter III., to Book XII.; for Chapter IV., to the early"
20630,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"books; for Chapters V., VI. and VII., to Chapman, Books V.-IX. and"
20631,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"XIII.; for Chapter VIII., to Books XIII. and XIV.; and for Chapter IX."
20632,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"to the end, to Chapman, Book XVI. and onwards. It must be agreed"
20633,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"that Lamb performed a difficult task with great skill and success,"
20634,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"especially when we consider his want of interest, frequently admitted,"
20635,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,in stories. But the pleasure of adding dignity and sweetness to the
20636,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,character of Ulysses seems to have been very considerable as he
20637,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"worked (or so I imagine), and he made practically a new thing, a very"
20638,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,persuasive blend of ancient and modern. The book has not been so
20639,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"popular as the _Tales from Shakespear_, but it has, I think, finer"
20640,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,literary merits and may perhaps be read by older intellects with more
20641,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,satisfaction.

20646,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20647,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,This charming little book was published by Mrs. Godwin at the end of
20648,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"1808, dated 1809, with no author's name attached. Besides, however,"
20649,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"ample internal evidence as to its authorship, there are many"
20650,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,references to it in Lamb's letters. Why it was issued anonymously we
20651,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"cannot now learn; probably, as I have suggested, from Mary Lamb's"
20652,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"unwillingness to have her name in print. The _Tales from Shakespear_,"
20653,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"it will be remembered, were described always as being by Charles Lamb,"
20654,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"although Mary did far more than half, and it was at the outset her"
20655,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"book. Her share of _Mrs. Leicester's School_ was equally great, and"
20656,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,a sentence in one of her letters to Sarah Stoddart suggests that it
20657,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"was hers in inception also: ""I have been busy making waistcoats, and"
20658,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"plotting new work to succeed the _Tales_."" Possibly it was because"
20659,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,his share in the book was so small that Lamb refused to sign _Mrs.
20660,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Leicester's School_ as he had the _Tales from Shakespear_; possibly
20661,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"he had other reasons, the title-page of his _Dramatic Specimens_"
20662,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"being one of them. When, a little while afterwards, the _Poetry for"
20663,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Children_ was published, it was stated to be ""by the author of _Mrs."
20664,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Leicester's School_,"" while several of the poems when reprinted by"
20665,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Mylius (see notes below) were signed Mrs. Leicester. Thus, Mary Lamb's"
20666,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,last chance of seeing her name on a title-page vanished. But we may
20667,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,feel confident that her own wishes were consulted in the matter.
20668,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20669,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Lamb's share in _Mrs. Leicester's School_ we know from a letter to
20670,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Bernard Barton (January 23, 1824): ""My Sister's part in the Leicester"
20671,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,School (about two thirds) was purely her own; as it was (to the same
20672,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,quantity) in the Shakspeare Tales which bear my name. I wrote only the
20673,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Witch Aunt, the first going to Church, and the final Story, about a"
20674,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"little Indian girl in a ship."""
20675,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20676,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"The little book was well received, and was quietly popular for some"
20677,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"years, running into eight editions by 1823. I imagine, however, that"
20678,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,it was little known between 1830 and the end of the century. Latterly
20679,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,there has been a revival in interest. One or two critics have touched
20680,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,rapturous heights in their praise. Landor wrote to Crabb Robinson in
20681,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"April, 1831:--"
20682,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20683,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,It is now several days since I read the book you recommended to
20684,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"me, ""Mrs. Leicester's School;"" and I feel as if I owed you a debt"
20685,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,in deferring to thank you for many hours of exquisite delight.
20686,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Never have I read anything in prose so many times over within so
20687,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"short a space of time as ""The Father's Wedding-day."" Most people,"
20688,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"I understand, prefer the first tale--in truth a very admirable"
20689,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"one--but others could have written it. Show me the man or woman,"
20690,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"modern or ancient, who could have written this one sentence: ""When"
20691,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"I was dressed in my new frock, I wished poor mamma was alive,"
20692,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,to see how fine I was on papa's wedding day; and I ran to my
20693,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"favourite station at her bedroom door."" How natural, in a little"
20694,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"girl, is this incongruity--this impossibility! Richardson would"
20695,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"have given his ""Clarissa,"" and Rousseau his ""Heloïse"" to have"
20696,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,imagined it. A fresh source of the pathetic bursts out before
20697,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"us, and not a bitter one. If your Germans can show us anything"
20698,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"comparable to what I have transcribed, I would almost undergo a"
20699,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,year's gargle of their language for it. The story is admirable
20700,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"throughout--incomparable, inimitable...."
20701,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20702,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Landor wrote to Lady Blessington to the same effect. Praise of this
20703,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,book is so pleasant to read that I quote his second letter too:--
20704,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20705,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"One of her tales is, with the sole exception of the _Bride of"
20706,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Lammermoor_, the most beautiful tale in prose composition in any"
20707,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"language, ancient or modern. A young girl has lost her mother, the"
20708,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"father marries again, and marries a friend of his former wife. The"
20709,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"child is ill reconciled to it, but being dressed in new clothes"
20710,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"for the marriage, she runs up to her mother's chamber, filled with"
20711,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,the idea how happy that dear mother would be at seeing her in all
20712,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"her glory--not reflecting, poor soul! that it was only by her"
20713,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"mother's death that she appeared in it. How natural, how novel is"
20714,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,all this! Did you ever imagine that a fresh source of the pathetic
20715,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,would burst forth before us in this trodden and hardened world? I
20716,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"never did, and when I found myself upon it, I pressed my temples"
20717,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"with both hands, and tears ran down to my elbows."
20718,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20719,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,And Coleridge remarked to Allsop:--
20720,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20721,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"It at once soothes and amuses me to think--nay, to know--that"
20722,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,the time will come when this little volume of my dear and
20723,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"well-nigh oldest friend, Mary Lamb, will be not only enjoyed but"
20724,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,acknowledged as a rich jewel in the treasury of our permanent
20725,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,English literature; and I cannot help running over in my mind the
20726,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"long list of celebrated writers, astonishing geniuses, Novels,"
20727,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Romances, Poems, Histories and dense Political Economy quartos"
20728,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"which, compared with _Mrs. Leicester's School_, will be remembered"
20729,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,as often and prized as highly as Wilkie's and Glover's _Epics_ and
20730,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Lord Bolingbroke's _Philosophies_ compared with _Robinson Crusoe_.
20731,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20732,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"I have set up the book from the second edition, 1809, because the"
20733,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Lambs' final text is probably to be found there. Although certain
20734,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,additional minor differences were made in the eighth and ninth
20735,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"editions, 1821 and 1825, I think it very unlikely that they were"
20736,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,made by Mary or Charles Lamb. The principal alteration between the
20737,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"second and first editions is page 317, line 6, ""your eyes were red"
20738,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"with weeping,"" for ""The traces of tears might still be seen on your"
20739,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"cheeks."" The other differences are very slight, mostly being in"
20740,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"punctuation, but there are also a few changes of word. I leave these,"
20741,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"however, to the Bibliographer."
20742,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20743,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"The eighth edition was furnished with the following preface; which,"
20744,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"though it is signed ""The Author,"" is not, I think, from either Mary or"
20745,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Charles Lamb's pen. I rather suspect Mrs. Godwin.
20746,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20747,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"""Tell me a story, Mamma,"" was almost the first request my own"
20748,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"child made me when she understood the meaning of a story, and"
20749,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,I soon discovered I had no easier method of managing a very
20750,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,difficult temper than by adapting my stories to the errors she
20751,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"committed, or the good qualities she announced; but as I found it"
20752,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,a very difficult and troublesome task to repeat the same story
20753,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"precisely the same each time, and as a sensible child, even at"
20754,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"so early a period as three years of age, will remember where the"
20755,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"narrator forgets, and never fail to detect the mistakes of the"
20756,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"second repetition, I came to the resolution to print a small"
20757,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"collection of stories for very young children, composed merely of"
20758,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,circumstances incidental to their age.
20759,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20760,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,The great error of many juvenile books is their deviation from truth;
20761,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"and as so much is absolutely necessary to be taught, why add to"
20762,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"the labour by impressing false ideas on the mind of an infant, and"
20763,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,thus lose the opportunity of making amusement the vehicle to convey
20764,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"instruction? A Mother only is, perhaps, capable of adapting stories to"
20765,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,the capacities of very young Children; for a Mother only watches the
20766,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"unfolding of their ideas, and the bent of their dispositions. If one"
20767,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,good Mother finds these tales of service to her in her arduous but
20768,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"pleasing task, my purpose will be answered."
20769,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
20770,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"It is stated that a French version of _Mrs. Leicester's School_, under"
20771,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"the title _Les Jeunes Pensionnaires_, was published. I have seen,"

20777,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"_Mrs. Leicester's School_ calls for little annotation, except for the"
20778,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,purpose of relating the stories to the lives of their writers; for it
20779,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,contains some very valuable autobiographical matter. But there are a
20780,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,few minor points too.

20959,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Charles Lamb's books for children. Of its history nothing is known:
20960,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,the proof that Charles Lamb wrote it is to be found in a letter
20961,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"from Lamb to Wordsworth, now in America, dated February 1, 1806,"

20964,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"editions of the correspondence tacked on to the letter dated June,"
20965,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,1806. In the earlier part of this missive Lamb enumerates the books
20966,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,which he has just despatched to Wordsworth by carrier from London.
20967,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Among these is an edition of Spenser, leading to the ""_apropos_."""

20975,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"one but the Godwins, who in 1806 were still publishing under cover of"
20976,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Thomas Hodgkins' name, in Hanway Street, it is reasonable to assume"
20977,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,that if a paraphrase of _The King and Queen of Hearts_ nursery rhyme
20978,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"could be found, bearing Hodgkins' or Godwin's name, and dated 1805 or"
20979,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"1806, Lamb would be its author. That such a work did exist was proved"
20980,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,by the advertisements at the end of other of Godwin's juvenile books.

20992,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,This series was called the Copperplate Series. In due course a copy
20993,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"of No. 1, _The King and Queen of Hearts_, was found in the library of"

20996,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,to whose enterprise we owe the facsimile editions of _Prince Dorus_

20998,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"authorship. The cover of Miss Pollock's copy bears the date 1809,"
20999,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,which means that the little book was re-bound as required with the

21029,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,_The King and Queen of Hearts_ cannot be said to add anything
21030,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,characteristic to the body of Lamb's writings. But its discovery
21031,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,is historically valuable in establishing--by the date 1805 on the
21032,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"engraved title-page--the fact that before the _Tales from Shakespear_,"
21033,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,which are usually thought to be the brother and sister's first

21046,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Robert Lloyd, writing from London to his wife in April, 1809, says"
21047,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"of Charles and Mary Lamb: ""If we may use the expression, their Union"

21049,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,the World _one_ to the _other_. They are writing a Book of Poetry
21050,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"for children together."" Later: ""It is _task_ work to them, they are"
21051,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"writing for money, and a Book of Poetry for Children being likely to"
21052,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"sell has induced them to compose one."" Writing to Coleridge of the"
21053,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"_Poetry for Children_, in June, 1809, Lamb says: ""Our little poems are"
21054,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"but humble, but they have no name. You must read them, remembering"
21055,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,they were task-work; and perhaps you will admire the number of
21056,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"subjects, all of children, picked out by an old Bachelor and an old"
21057,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Maid. Many parents would not have found so many."" Charles Lamb, by the"
21058,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"way, was then thirty-four, and Mary Lamb forty-four. In sending the"
21059,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"book to Manning, Lamb said that his own share of the poems was only"
21060,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,one-third.
21061,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
21062,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,The little book seems to have been quickly allowed by its publisher
21063,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,to pass into the void. Possibly the two-volume form was found to be
21064,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"impracticable: at any rate _Poetry for Children_ disappeared, many"
21065,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,of its pieces at various times reappearing with the signature Mrs.
21066,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Leicester in _The Junior Class-Book_ (two pieces), in _The First Book"
21067,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,of Poetry_ (twenty-two pieces) and _The Poetical Class Book_ (three
21068,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"pieces), all compiled by William Frederic Mylius, a Christ's Hospital"
21069,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"master, and published by Mrs. Godwin. Hence the extreme rarity of"
21070,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"_Poetry for Children_, which seemed to be completely lost until, in"
21071,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"1877, a copy was found in Australia. Two or three other copies of"
21072,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,the English edition have since come to light. Mylius used also the
21073,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,frontispieces to the two volumes. As I have not seen all the editions

21075,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,complete.

21141,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,(?) Mary Lamb. This poem was the subject of the frontispiece to
21142,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Vol. I. of the original edition. According to a letter from Jean D.
21143,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Montgomery printed in _The County Gentleman_ in August, 1907, there is"
21144,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,extant in Kirkcudbrightshire a legend on which this poem is probably
21145,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,based. She writes thus:--
21146,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
21147,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"""At the farm of Newlaw, in the parish of Rerrick, in"
21148,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, some people named Crosbie lived"
21149,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"about the year 1782--at least, they had a son, Douglas, who was"
21150,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,born there in that year. When the child grew old enough to trot
21151,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,about by himself his mother was in the habit of giving him his
21152,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,plate of porridge and milk to take outside the farm and eat every
21153,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"morning. He had probably done so for long enough, when one day,"
21154,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"his mother, happening to go out, saw him seated on the ground"
21155,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"eating his porridge in company with an adder, who, however,"
21156,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"instead of hurting the child, merely supped up the milk. When the"
21157,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"reptile edged a little nearer to the boy than was quite equal,"
21158,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Douglas slapped the adder on his head with his horn spoon, saying,"
21159,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"""Keep yer ain side o' the plate, Grey Bairdie."""
21160,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
21161,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"The mother was, of course, terrified, but waited until the boy had"
21162,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"finished his meal, when she called in the neighbours and killed the"
21163,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,adder.
21164,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,
21165,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Curiously enough a precisely similar story turned up in Hungary in

21325,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,At the 96th page of the new edition of Charles and Mary Lamb's
21326,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,'_Poetry for Children_' is a little poem of which the authorship can
21327,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"hardly be doubtful, done into rhyme from the blank verse of Webster; a"
21328,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,translation by no means to its advantage. The original is to be found
21329,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"in the third act of the ""Duchess of Malfi,"" in the magnificent scene"
21330,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,where the privacy of the wedded lovers is invaded by Ferdinand; in
21331,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"whose mouth the apologue transferred or ""conveyed"" by Lamb into the"
21332,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,quaint and delightful little book over the recovery of which all the
21333,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"hearts of his lovers are yet warm with rejoicing, has a tragic and"
21334,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,terrible significance. It may be worth remark that the _Poetry for
21335,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,Children_ appeared the year after that--most fortunate of years
21336,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,for all students of the higher English drama--which was made nobly
21337,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,memorable by the appearance of the matchless and priceless volume of
21338,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,'_Specimens of English Dramatic Poets who Lived about the Time of
21339,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"Shakespear_,' in which the fratricide's apologue is translated at"
21340,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,length; so that while some part of Lamb's too rare leisure was given
21341,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,"to the gentle ""task work"" of making rhymes for little children, the"
21342,CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM GODWIN,first strong savour of a fierce delight in his new intimacy with the
