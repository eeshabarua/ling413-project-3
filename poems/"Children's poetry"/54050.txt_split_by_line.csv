42,ROSIE.,
43,ROSIE.,Rosie is the name of the little girl whose picture you see on the first
44,ROSIE.,"page, with a snowball in her hands. Of course her name is Rosa really,"
45,ROSIE.,"but somehow we always call her Rosie. Has she not a bright, pretty,"
46,ROSIE.,"laughing little face, with her blue eyes, and fair hair? She is a fine"
47,ROSIE.,"strong little maiden into the bargain; a trifle wilful, perhaps, and a"
48,ROSIE.,good deal of a romp.
49,ROSIE.,
50,ROSIE.,Last Christmas I was staying at Cranley Grange--Rosie's home in the
51,ROSIE.,"country,--when one morning at breakfast her mamma said to me--""Charlie"
52,ROSIE.,"is coming home to-day; I can't go to meet him, my cough is so bad. I"
53,ROSIE.,"wonder if you would mind driving down to the station, and taking Rosie"
54,ROSIE.,"and Frank?"""
55,ROSIE.,
56,ROSIE.,"Charlie, who was the eldest son, and a great favourite of mine, was"
57,ROSIE.,"coming home for his Christmas holidays. He was about fourteen years old,"
58,ROSIE.,"while Rosie was only ten, and Frank two years younger."
59,ROSIE.,
60,ROSIE.,"I said I should be delighted to go, thinking what a pleasant drive it"
61,ROSIE.,would be with those merry laughing children. Little did I anticipate the
62,ROSIE.,"trial to my nerves, and the succession of frights, that were in store"
63,ROSIE.,for me.
64,ROSIE.,
65,ROSIE.,"We were soon seated in the open wagonette, and off we started. Though I"
66,ROSIE.,"should not say _seated_, for the children scarcely sat down at all: they"
67,ROSIE.,"kept jumping up, changing places, pushing each other, and playing all"
68,ROSIE.,sorts of pranks. I was in an agony of fear lest they should tumble out;
69,ROSIE.,"and during the whole drive, I sat with my arms extended, clutching hold,"
70,ROSIE.,"sometimes of one, sometimes of the other, to save them. This was fright"
71,ROSIE.,number one.
72,ROSIE.,
73,ROSIE.,At last we arrived at the station;--the children still in uproarious
74,ROSIE.,"spirits, though with cherry noses, as well as rosy cheeks, from the"
75,ROSIE.,"cold. I must tell you that there was snow upon the ground; and as,"
76,ROSIE.,"unluckily, we had ten minutes to wait for the train, they began to amuse"
77,ROSIE.,"themselves by snowballing each other. Frank set the example, and they"
78,ROSIE.,"found it such fun that I scolded, and begged them to be quiet, in vain."
79,ROSIE.,"At last I observed Rosie standing quite at the end of the platform,"
80,ROSIE.,"where the snow was thicker, and she had collected a large snowball,"
81,ROSIE.,"which she held up in her hands. As I looked at her, and thought what a"
82,ROSIE.,"pretty picture she made, I noticed, in the landscape behind her, a"
83,ROSIE.,"little puff of white smoke. It was the approaching train, at a distance"
84,ROSIE.,"of not more than half a mile. I thought her position, at the extremity"
85,ROSIE.,"of the platform, and just at the edge too, terribly dangerous. And this"
86,ROSIE.,may be called--fright number two.
87,ROSIE.,
88,ROSIE.,"I had just opened my lips to call out to her that the train was coming,"
89,ROSIE.,"when a whole handful of snow came dab into my face, filling my mouth and"
90,ROSIE.,"eyes. It was that little rogue Frank, who had crept close up to me, and"
91,ROSIE.,playfully bestowed upon my face the snow he had been collecting.
92,ROSIE.,"Recovering from the shock, I looked out again for Rosie. She was no"
93,ROSIE.,"longer in the same place; but, quite beyond the platform, and close upon"
94,ROSIE.,"the rails, I saw her kneeling down in the snow. I screamed with all my"
95,ROSIE.,"might, and a railway porter ran to her, whisked her up in his arms, and"
96,ROSIE.,brought her safely on to the platform again. This was fright number
97,ROSIE.,"three; and never, I think, before or since, have I been so much"
98,ROSIE.,frightened as I was for the moment.
99,ROSIE.,
100,ROSIE.,"Directly afterwards the train stopped, and Charlie jumped out. When he"
101,ROSIE.,"heard of Rosie's danger, he scolded her as if he had been a little"
102,ROSIE.,"grandfather, and his words seemed to have much more weight than mine. I"
103,ROSIE.,"now observed that Rosie had a tiny white rabbit in her arms, and she"
104,ROSIE.,told us that this was what she was picking up out of the snow upon the
105,ROSIE.,rails. She thought it was quite excuse enough for herself when she
106,ROSIE.,"said:--""Only think, Charlie dear, haven't I saved the life of this"
107,ROSIE.,"pretty little rabbit?"""
108,ROSIE.,
109,ROSIE.,"On the way home, Charlie sat in front and drove, with the coachman"
110,ROSIE.,"beside him; but he contrived now and then to turn his head a little, and"
111,ROSIE.,keep up his lecture to his brother and sister about their riotous
112,ROSIE.,"behaviour all the way. Meanwhile I sat quiet, rather humbled at"
113,ROSIE.,observing how much more respect they showed for the scolding they got
114,ROSIE.,from their big brother than for mine. But of one thing I am certain:
115,ROSIE.,nothing would ever induce me to take charge of those two lively young
116,ROSIE.,people on an expedition of the kind again.

181,WOODEN HORSE.,"There stood once, in the good old time--that is to say some fifteen"
182,WOODEN HORSE.,"years ago, which we may call ages for you, my little readers, who have"
183,WOODEN HORSE.,"not yet lost your pretty first teeth;--there stood, then, once, in a"
184,WOODEN HORSE.,"delightful valley, between Long-Pont and Savigny, in France, a charming"
185,WOODEN HORSE.,"country house, surrounded by a wood, which spread along the bank of a"
186,WOODEN HORSE.,little winding river.
187,WOODEN HORSE.,
188,WOODEN HORSE.,"The house of which I speak was called a chateau--that is, a castle--by"
189,WOODEN HORSE.,"the peasants of the neighbourhood. To tell the truth, however, it was"
190,WOODEN HORSE.,"only a moderate-sized house; but it was kept in excellent order,"
191,WOODEN HORSE.,"although a very old building. In spite of its age, therefore, it wore a"
192,WOODEN HORSE.,"smiling aspect, like the faces of those amiable and good grandmammas,"

195,WOODEN HORSE.,"Let us go in: I wish to make you acquainted with a little companion,"

197,WOODEN HORSE.,"drawing-room, where the window, opening to the ground, shows us a garden"
198,WOODEN HORSE.,beyond. At this moment he is repeating a fable to his mother. It is one
199,WOODEN HORSE.,which teaches that pride is a great fault; that we ought not to assume
200,WOODEN HORSE.,"airs of superiority towards the unhappy and humble, nor endeavour to"
201,WOODEN HORSE.,"excite envy in their hearts; and that Providence, moreover, takes upon"
202,WOODEN HORSE.,"itself sometimes to punish those who do so. This fable, as you have"
203,WOODEN HORSE.,"already guessed perhaps, is called--""The Oak and the Reed."""

208,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],My little friend's attention from the first has been about equally
209,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"divided between the fable he is repeating and a beautiful wooden horse,"
210,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],which stands fastened by the bridle to a tree in the garden: but before
211,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"the fable is finished, it is evident that his thoughts are altogether"
212,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"taken up by the horse. It is a pity; because, not attending to the"
213,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"punishment of the oak, he will lose the moral of the fable. But let us"
214,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"not be more severe on him than his mamma, who does not seem much"
215,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"distressed about the matter. Besides, who can keep the thoughts from"

218,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"This little boy's name is Maurice; a nice soft-sounding name, I think;"

228,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"silk and velvet, would no doubt like to know how my little friend was"
229,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"dressed. Well then, his mamma did not let him wear such fine clothes as"
230,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],would interfere with his exercise or his games. Perhaps some of my
231,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],elegantly dressed little readers would not care to play with him when
232,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"they hear that he wore neither velvet nor fur, nor even a feather in his"
233,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"cap; but had simply a jacket and trowsers, made of linen in summer, and"
234,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"of warm cloth in winter. For all that, however, he was a good little"
235,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"boy, and well brought up."
236,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],
237,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],Directly he had repeated the last verse of the fable--which he did
238,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],without thinking at all of its meaning--Maurice bounded off from the
239,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"drawing-room into the garden. In a moment he had unfastened the horse,"
240,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"and placing his foot in the stirrup, had sprung on its back. Then he"
241,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"called out: ""Gee-up, Cressida! gee-up, my friend!"""
242,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],
243,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"Cressida, after shaking its head and flowing mane, started off at a"
244,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"gallop, putting out its legs in the most graceful way imaginable."
245,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"Because I have said that Cressida was a wooden horse, you picture it to"
246,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],yourselves perhaps as resembling other wooden horses that you have
247,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"seen,--pretty toy horses, no doubt: but either they have been only"
248,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"rocking-horses, or they have just moved a little means of some mechanism"
249,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],which does not produce the real action of a horse. Cressida was like
250,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],none of these; but lifted up its legs one after the other with the grace
251,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],and elegance of a thoroughbred English horse.
252,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],
253,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"Yes, certainly, for a horse made of wood, it was very wonderful. It had"
254,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"a curving neck, a long black tail. The muscles were marked, as you see"
255,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"in well-bred horses; the chest was powerful, the head small, the ears"
256,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"delicate, the eyes full of fire, and the skin was soft and glossy. Add"
257,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],to all this that every time you stroked Cressida on the neck it neighed
258,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"joyously, and it obeyed the bridle like the most docile Arab horse."
259,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],
260,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"It had many other precious qualities; but were I to tell you all, this"
261,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],book would not contain the description: I should be obliged to make a
262,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"second volume. I will only add, therefore, that this wonderful horse"
263,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],could remain without food or drink for any length of time that
264,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],circumstances might render convenient.
265,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],
266,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"Unfortunately I can give no precise details concerning the birth,"
267,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"education, or infantine peculiarities of Cressida. It would even be"
268,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],impossible to learn them now; for the only person who knew anything
269,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],about them--the old man who gave the horse to my little friend--is no
270,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],longer alive. We know very little even of this old man himself. He was a
271,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"native of Nuremberg, an ancient city of Germany, where it is supposed"
272,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"that clocks were first invented. It seems that in his own country,"
273,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],Fritz--for that was the only name we knew him by--had been considered an
274,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],extraordinary mechanician; and he was driven away from Nuremberg through
275,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"the jealousy and enmity of a rich and powerful Burgomaster of the city,"
276,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],who had a turn for mechanical inventions himself.
277,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],
278,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"The invention upon which this Burgomaster most prided himself, was an"
279,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"automaton, or wooden figure, of a woman, which walked, and smirked, and"
280,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"smiled, like a real lady; but he could not make her speak. Fritz, who"
281,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"was then young, devoted himself to a similar work; and made a figure"
282,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"representing a young peasant-girl, who could say, ""Good morning,"" and"
283,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"inquire after your health; and, if you took her by the hand, would look"
284,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],down with admirable modesty and grace. The success of Fritz gave great
285,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"offence to the Burgomaster; and there grew up between the two, first a"
286,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"rivalry, then an enmity, which at last caused Fritz to leave the city."
287,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],
288,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"When little Maurice first knew him, Fritz could hardly have been less"
289,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],than seventy-five years old: he was so old that his hair was quite
290,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"white, his head shook a little, and he only walked by the help of a"
291,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"stick. He lived as if he was very poor, in a small cottage near the"
292,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"house of Maurice's parents. Whenever Maurice saw him, the little boy"
293,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"always wished him good morning, and stopped to talk to him. Fritz was"
294,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"very much pleased with these attentions, and began to feel a strong"
295,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],affection for the child; who was not slow to return it.
296,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],
297,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"The child's instinct told him that Fritz was good and unfortunate,"
298,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],deserving to be loved and pitied. And indeed he did deserve pity. In the
299,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"decline of his life, not only did he live in poverty, but the peasants"
300,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"of the village he had chosen for his retreat, hurt perhaps by the"
301,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"coldness and reserve of his manners, used to laugh at him, and sometimes"
302,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"insult him. The boys of the place, generally mischievous and badly"
303,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],"brought up, would run after him, and mimicking his German accent,"
304,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],inquire whether he had a cold in his head that he was obliged to speak
305,UP AS SOLDIERS--TURCOS OR ZOUAVES.],through his nose.

309,GRACEFULLY.],
310,GRACEFULLY.],"One summer evening, when Maurice and his parents were in the garden,"
311,GRACEFULLY.],"enjoying the freshness of the air and the perfume of the flowers, they"
312,GRACEFULLY.],"heard the bell ring at the gate, and presently Fritz came up to them,"
313,GRACEFULLY.],leading by the bridle a pretty little black horse. In few words the old
314,GRACEFULLY.],"man explained the motive of his visit. He wished, before leaving the"
315,GRACEFULLY.],"world, to make Maurice a present of the wooden horse which he had"
316,GRACEFULLY.],brought with him.
317,GRACEFULLY.],
318,GRACEFULLY.],"""A wooden horse!"" they all exclaimed, for they had mistaken Cressida for"
319,GRACEFULLY.],a real live pony.
320,GRACEFULLY.],
321,GRACEFULLY.],"""It is not a being created by God,"" said Fritz, ""but only a thing made"
322,GRACEFULLY.],"of wood. By some mechanism, which I will not explain to you, it is"
323,GRACEFULLY.],endowed with the action and movements of a real horse. Cressida is what
324,GRACEFULLY.],"I possess most precious in the world, and I have made up my mind to part"
325,GRACEFULLY.],"with it only because I love your little son, and know he deserves to"
326,GRACEFULLY.],possess an object which I care more for than I do for the few days of
327,GRACEFULLY.],"life that remain to me."""
328,GRACEFULLY.],
329,GRACEFULLY.],Then he explained to Maurice how to manage the horse; how to make it
330,GRACEFULLY.],"move, and to guide it. He took the little hand of the child and placed"
331,GRACEFULLY.],"it softly on the pony's neck, which immediately neighed as if with"
332,GRACEFULLY.],pleasure. He showed Maurice how to sit the horse firmly and gracefully;
333,GRACEFULLY.],"and when the little boy, who was very intelligent, understood all this,"
334,GRACEFULLY.],Fritz told him he might start off. The child had only to press his knees
335,GRACEFULLY.],"hard against the sides of Cressida, and off it went at a gallop. The"
336,GRACEFULLY.],"rider's heart beat quickly, but he kept his seat, and guiding the pony"
337,GRACEFULLY.],"back again, pulled up at the spot he had started from."
338,GRACEFULLY.],
339,GRACEFULLY.],Maurice's father and mother were lost in amazement; they did not know
340,GRACEFULLY.],"how to show their gratitude, for Fritz was not a man to offer money to."
341,GRACEFULLY.],They begged him to leave his cottage and come and live with them. Fritz
342,GRACEFULLY.],"thanked them, but said that he intended in a few days to leave the"

414,CATS.,"you; for there is scarcely a home in England, rich or poor, which is"
415,CATS.,without a pussy.
416,CATS.,
417,CATS.,"How the children all love the little kitten, the nursery pet, with its"
418,CATS.,pretty playful ways and graceful movements! But kitty grows up too soon
419,CATS.,"into the sedate old mother-cat, like the one we see in the picture"
420,CATS.,holding the poor little mouse in her mouth. Ah! that to me is a terrible
421,CATS.,"drawback to Pussy,--that love of killing."
422,CATS.,
423,CATS.,I am so fond of cats that this year I went to the Crystal Palace Cat
424,CATS.,"Show, where I saw some beauties: among others a tortoiseshell Tom, which"
425,CATS.,"is said to be a great rarity. Hundreds of cats, large and small,"
426,CATS.,"long-haired and short-haired, long-tailed and tailless, cats of every"
427,CATS.,"colour known to catdom, filled the cages, which were arranged in long"
428,CATS.,rows. And I must say they bore their imprisonment with wonderful
429,CATS.,"patience. For three days they had been shut up in those wire houses,"
430,CATS.,"like birds: and some of the cages housed a whole family. One, I"
431,CATS.,"remember, contained a mamma and her six children; the latter small, but"
432,CATS.,very rampageous. I pitied this poor mother with all my heart: how her
433,CATS.,patience must have been tried during those three dreadful days!
434,CATS.,
435,CATS.,"Though we may not like to see cats kill small animals, Puss is often"
436,CATS.,valued in proportion as she can rid the house of rats and mice. So it
437,CATS.,"is, I suspect, with the cat in the picture. She is evidently owned by a"
438,CATS.,"carpenter, who perhaps found his workshop infested by rats and mice till"
439,CATS.,"he possessed this handsome tabby. She will soon rid him of them, I"
440,CATS.,think: and see how she is teaching her kittens to follow her example!
441,CATS.,
442,CATS.,"But in spite of their natural instinct to destroy mice and birds, cats"
443,CATS.,may be easily taught to live in friendship with these very creatures;
444,CATS.,"and I will tell you a story of a pet cat which, I think, will amuse you"
445,CATS.,better than hearing about the poor little mice being killed.
446,CATS.,
447,CATS.,"A lady that I know had a fine tabby cat, and also a very beautiful"
448,CATS.,canary. The cat's name was Bijou; the canary's--Cherry. Now Bijou had
449,CATS.,"been brought up from kittenhood with Cherry: that is, he had been"
450,CATS.,"accustomed to sit on the rug beside the fire, while Cherry sang in his"
451,CATS.,"cage on the table, or hanging at the window. Bijou always behaved"
452,CATS.,"perfectly well, and never attempted to molest Cherry."
453,CATS.,
454,CATS.,The mistress of these two pets used to let the canary fly about
455,CATS.,"sometimes in her bedroom, but she never had quite confidence enough in"
456,CATS.,Bijou to do this while he was there. One day in summer the window of the
457,CATS.,"bedroom happened to be open at the top without her noticing it, and the"
458,CATS.,"canary, after flying about the room a little while, passed out of the"
459,CATS.,"window. It flew round and about, from tree to tree, seeming to enjoy its"
460,CATS.,liberty very much.
461,CATS.,
462,CATS.,"The lady feared she had lost it for ever, but she brought out the cage"
463,CATS.,"and placed it upon the lawn, thinking there was just a chance that the"
464,CATS.,canary might come back to its old home of its own accord. As she stood
465,CATS.,"at the window watching, she presently saw the bird alight on the lawn. A"
466,CATS.,"moment afterwards she saw Bijou, who had been crouching in a bed of"
467,CATS.,"flowers, spring out, pounce upon the little creature, and seize it in"
468,CATS.,his mouth.
469,CATS.,
470,CATS.,"Then, to the lady's astonishment, who expected to see the bird devoured,"
471,CATS.,"Bijou trotted with it up to the cage, and deposited the truant safely"
472,CATS.,"inside again. Cherry was dreadfully frightened, but not at all hurt, and"
473,CATS.,"after shaking its rumpled feathers into their places, sat on its perch"
474,CATS.,as happy as ever.

542,A FAIRY STORY.,"like feathers on the pavement all day long. It was now dark, and little"
543,A FAIRY STORY.,"Otto stood at the dining-room window, watching them still falling in the"
544,A FAIRY STORY.,light of the lamps outside. Otto is a handsome boy of about seven years
545,A FAIRY STORY.,old. It is New Year's Eve; and he is going to a party this evening.
546,A FAIRY STORY.,"Bertha, his sister, is being dressed for it at the present time, but he"
547,A FAIRY STORY.,"had been so noisy and troublesome, up in the nursery, while the ceremony"
548,A FAIRY STORY.,"of her dressing was going on, that he was sent downstairs to wait till"
549,A FAIRY STORY.,his turn came.
550,A FAIRY STORY.,
551,A FAIRY STORY.,"Otto had been to a good many parties, and to two pantomimes this winter;"
552,A FAIRY STORY.,still he was not at all tired of either parties or pantomimes; on the
553,A FAIRY STORY.,"contrary, the more he went to the more he seemed to like them. But it"
554,A FAIRY STORY.,was only at Christmas Otto was so gay; for did he not do lessons all the
555,A FAIRY STORY.,rest of the year with his sister's governess? Miss Wigly was very
556,A FAIRY STORY.,"strict, and thought children were much better without many"
557,A FAIRY STORY.,"holidays;--""particularly little boys,"" she said. But perhaps that was"
558,A FAIRY STORY.,because she was so anxious to get Otto well forward before he went to
559,A FAIRY STORY.,school.
560,A FAIRY STORY.,
561,A FAIRY STORY.,For the last ten minutes he had been staring at the snow outside the
562,A FAIRY STORY.,"dining-room windows, then he turned round and looked at the things in"
563,A FAIRY STORY.,"the room. A bright fire blazed on the hearth, the cloth was already laid"
564,A FAIRY STORY.,"for the dinner of the older members of the family, and by the side of"
565,A FAIRY STORY.,"the fire stood a comfortable easy chair, which papa generally sat in as"
566,A FAIRY STORY.,soon as he had done his dinner.
567,A FAIRY STORY.,
568,A FAIRY STORY.,[Illustration: Reflections]
569,A FAIRY STORY.,
570,A FAIRY STORY.,"Otto seated himself in this chair, and began to look at a bottle of"
571,A FAIRY STORY.,"water, which stood at the corner of the table nearest to him. His"
572,A FAIRY STORY.,attention was attracted by the odd way in which things were reflected in
573,A FAIRY STORY.,"the water. How minute the reflections were, and how they all curved, so"
574,A FAIRY STORY.,"as to make the room look round, as if seen in a mirror! He observed,"
575,A FAIRY STORY.,"too, his own little face, sometimes lengthened, sometimes widened,"
576,A FAIRY STORY.,according to the part of the bottle he saw it in. These observations did
577,A FAIRY STORY.,not prevent him from thinking at the same time what a comfortable easy
578,A FAIRY STORY.,"chair he was sitting in, and what a nice warm fire it was."
579,A FAIRY STORY.,
580,A FAIRY STORY.,"How long he had been reflecting upon all these things he never knew,"
581,A FAIRY STORY.,"when he observed, to his surprise, that the bottle was growing bigger;"
582,A FAIRY STORY.,"and, in another moment, instead of looking at it from the outside, he"
583,A FAIRY STORY.,"found himself inside it, looking at the objects beyond. And these were"
584,A FAIRY STORY.,"all changed. There was no water in the bottle now, but the water was"
585,A FAIRY STORY.,"outside, and the bottle itself was floating upon a river. The river"
586,A FAIRY STORY.,"seemed to wind along between mountains, and had beautiful buildings and"
587,A FAIRY STORY.,"trees upon its banks. A boat, rowed by two queer little men, was"
588,A FAIRY STORY.,"fastened by a chain to the bottle; and, as they rowed, the bottle was"
589,A FAIRY STORY.,towed along. Gold and silver fish were playing about in the water; tiny
590,A FAIRY STORY.,children with wings were sporting in the air. The bottle inside was
591,A FAIRY STORY.,fitted up like an elegant drawing-room; and--most wonderful of all!--a
592,A FAIRY STORY.,beautiful fairy reclined on a sofa in the midst of it.
593,A FAIRY STORY.,
594,A FAIRY STORY.,"Otto knew she was a fairy, because she was just like those he had seen"
595,A FAIRY STORY.,"at the play, dressed all in gold and silver tissue, and sparkling with"
596,A FAIRY STORY.,"jewels. Besides, although she looked grown-up, she was not bigger than"
597,A FAIRY STORY.,Otto himself. She spoke to him also in the beautiful language used in
598,A FAIRY STORY.,plays:--
599,A FAIRY STORY.,
600,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Mortal child,"" she said, ""thou lovest well to join in the festivities"
601,A FAIRY STORY.,"of other mortals,--what sayest thou now to making one in a fairy revel?"""
602,A FAIRY STORY.,
603,A FAIRY STORY.,"""A fairy party, do you mean, ma'am?"" asked Otto. ""It would be awfully"
604,A FAIRY STORY.,"jolly, I should think."""
605,A FAIRY STORY.,
606,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Come, then, with me,"" said the fairy, rising from her sofa."
607,A FAIRY STORY.,
608,A FAIRY STORY.,[Illustration: Fairy party]
609,A FAIRY STORY.,
610,A FAIRY STORY.,"As she did so, it occurred to Otto that they would wonder what had"
611,A FAIRY STORY.,"become of him at home. He hesitated, and said,--"
612,A FAIRY STORY.,
613,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Could I go back home for a minute first, if you please, ma'am, to let"
614,A FAIRY STORY.,"them know where I am? And I think my sister, Bertha, would like very"
615,A FAIRY STORY.,"much to come too, if she might."""
616,A FAIRY STORY.,
617,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Mortal boy, dost fear to trust thyself with us?"" exclaimed the fairy,"
618,A FAIRY STORY.,indignantly.
619,A FAIRY STORY.,
620,A FAIRY STORY.,"Otto felt he had offended her, but before he could reply, she had"
621,A FAIRY STORY.,"disappeared. For a moment everything seemed confused: ""Just like a"
622,A FAIRY STORY.,"change of scene in a pantomime,"" thought Otto to himself. Afterwards,"
623,A FAIRY STORY.,"instead of floating along upon the river, he found himself sitting upon"
624,A FAIRY STORY.,"its bank, while a very large moon rose over the water. Bertha was"
625,A FAIRY STORY.,"sitting by his side, and two lovely fairies stood by them, but not the"
626,A FAIRY STORY.,"same fairy as before. In front of him, standing up in the water, was a"
627,A FAIRY STORY.,"very shabby, damp-looking, white-bearded old man. Otto was puzzled to"
628,A FAIRY STORY.,"account for him at first, then he recollected to have seen a picture"
629,A FAIRY STORY.,"somewhere of old Father Thames, and he assumed that this old man must be"
630,A FAIRY STORY.,the river-god. There were also some little naked fairies hovering about
631,A FAIRY STORY.,"him, ""And those,"" thought Otto, ""must be little streams that run into"
632,A FAIRY STORY.,"the river."" Besides all these, there was a large tortoise or turtle"
633,A FAIRY STORY.,"close to Otto, which crept up, and stared him in the face."
634,A FAIRY STORY.,
635,A FAIRY STORY.,"The old man, addressing Bertha and Otto, said,--""Tell me, children, what"
636,A FAIRY STORY.,"is your wish?"""
637,A FAIRY STORY.,
638,A FAIRY STORY.,"Before Otto could put in a word, Bertha exclaimed,--""I want to go to the"
639,A FAIRY STORY.,"fairy revel."""
640,A FAIRY STORY.,
641,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Why, she seems to know all about it!"" thought Otto, very much"
642,A FAIRY STORY.,"surprised. The words--fairy revel--uttered by Bertha, were repeated by"
643,A FAIRY STORY.,"voices in the air, on the earth, among the reeds, in the water,"
644,A FAIRY STORY.,"everywhere. Gradually the sounds died away in the distance, and as they"
645,A FAIRY STORY.,"did so, Otto discovered that he was alone."
646,A FAIRY STORY.,
647,A FAIRY STORY.,[Illustration: Turtle steed]
648,A FAIRY STORY.,
649,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Why, they have all gone off to the fairy ball, and left me behind,"""
650,A FAIRY STORY.,"said Otto, aloud to himself. ""How shall I ever get there now?"""
651,A FAIRY STORY.,
652,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Jump on my back,"" cried a voice from the grass. It was the tortoise:"
653,A FAIRY STORY.,"and Otto observed that it had a kind of side-saddle on its back, and a"
654,A FAIRY STORY.,bridle in its mouth.
655,A FAIRY STORY.,
656,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Can you go fast?"" said Otto, doubtingly."
657,A FAIRY STORY.,
658,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Try me!"" briefly replied Mr. Tortoise."
659,A FAIRY STORY.,
660,A FAIRY STORY.,"Otto did so, seating himself as he thought a lady-fairy might do. Rather"
661,A FAIRY STORY.,"to his own surprise, he felt no alarm when the creature rose up from the"
662,A FAIRY STORY.,"earth, and bore him rushing through the air. He seemed to be rapidly"
663,A FAIRY STORY.,"approaching the moon, when suddenly a harsh voice sounded in his"
664,A FAIRY STORY.,"ears:--""Why, you're not dressed."" He looked at himself, and perceived,"
665,A FAIRY STORY.,"to his dismay, that he had on his nightgown. ""How stupid of me,"" thought"
666,A FAIRY STORY.,"he; ""why, I must have jumped out of bed, and come off, without dressing."
667,A FAIRY STORY.,"What shall I do at the fairy ball?"""
668,A FAIRY STORY.,
669,A FAIRY STORY.,"Again the same great voice cried,--""You're not dressed,"" and the words"
670,A FAIRY STORY.,"were followed by a merry peal of laughter. Otto looked at himself again,"
671,A FAIRY STORY.,"and now all was changed: he had on his usual little jacket, his"
672,A FAIRY STORY.,"nickerbockers, warm stockings, and shoes. He was in his father's easy"
673,A FAIRY STORY.,"chair, and the water-bottle was on the table before him. Bertha stood"
674,A FAIRY STORY.,"there, dressed for her party, laughing with all her might; while Mrs."
675,A FAIRY STORY.,Crump the nurse looked very cross.
676,A FAIRY STORY.,
677,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Oh, nurse, why did you wake me? I was on my way to the fairies' ball."""
678,A FAIRY STORY.,
679,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Fairies' fiddlestick!"" rejoined Mrs. Crump. ""Come and get dressed"
680,A FAIRY STORY.,"directly."""
681,A FAIRY STORY.,
682,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Oh, Bertha, Bertha, I have had such a wonderful dream; just like being"
683,A FAIRY STORY.,"at the play. I'll tell you all about it."""
684,A FAIRY STORY.,
685,A FAIRY STORY.,"""Well, never mind now,"" replied Bertha, snubbing him with all the"
686,A FAIRY STORY.,"importance of a sister three or four years his senior. ""Make haste and"
687,A FAIRY STORY.,"dress, or we shan't go to Aunt Julia's ball, which I care more about."""

740,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"Now, darling children, come round me while we have a little talk fit for"
741,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,Sundays. You remember that during the past year I gave you some account
742,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"of our Saviour's teaching, and of the principal events of His life. Now"
743,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,I shall tell you about some of the miracles He performed.
744,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,
745,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"The word ""Miracle"" signifies simply--wonder: but there may, of course,"
746,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"be many wonderful events which are not miracles. As the word is used, a"
747,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,miracle means strictly an act by which the laws of nature are set aside:
748,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"and though the wisest of us do not understand all nature's laws, we"
749,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"should be able, I think, generally to distinguish what was really a"
750,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"miracle from what was merely wonderful. For instance, if a doctor were"
751,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"to cure a blind man by anointing his eyes, we might think it wonderful,"
752,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,but should conclude that he had discovered a cure for that kind of
753,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"blindness. If the physician, however, were to give sight to the blind"
754,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"man by merely commanding him to see, we might then pronounce the cure a"
755,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,miracle.
756,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,
757,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,The Jews expected that all who claimed to be prophets should perform
758,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"some miracle to prove that they were divinely inspired; as did Moses,"
759,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"Elijah, Elisha, and several of the prophets. When the divine promise was"
760,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"given to Moses and others, that a great prophet should be raised up for"
761,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"the people of Israel, it was foretold that this prophet should be known"
762,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,by the greatness and variety of the miracles which he performed.
763,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,
764,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"By such signs he was to be distinguished from all pretenders, and Isaiah"
765,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"says:--""Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened; and the ears of the"
766,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the"
767,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"tongue of the dumb sing."""
768,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,
769,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,Our Saviour may be said generally to have had two objects in performing
770,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"miracles. In most instances, one object was the immediate relief of"
771,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,suffering. But He always had the greater object by His miracles of
772,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"proving that He was the Christ, whose coming had been foretold to the"
773,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,Jews so long before. The miracles were the _signs_ that He was the
774,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,Messiah.
775,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,
776,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,The first miracle performed by our Saviour was that of turning water
777,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,into wine.
778,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,
779,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"We are told by St. John that there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee,"
780,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,and at the feast our Saviour and His mother were present. After a time
781,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,the servants found that the supply of wine for the guests was running
782,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"short. One of them told this to the mother of Jesus, and she, going to"
783,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"Him, said:--""They have no wine."""
784,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,
785,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,The miracle which followed is thus related in the words of Scripture:--
786,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,
787,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"""Jesus saith unto them: Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled"
788,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"them to the brim. And He saith unto them: Draw out now, and bear unto"
789,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,the governor of the feast. And they bare it. When the ruler of the feast
790,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was:"
791,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,(but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast
792,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"called the bridegroom, and saith unto him: Every man at the beginning"
793,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which"
794,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now."""
795,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,
796,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"This was the first miracle that Jesus did: in our next Sunday-talk, my"
797,WATER TURNED INTO WINE.,"children, I will tell you more of them."

811,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,It was the thirteenth of February; to-morrow would be St. Valentine's
812,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,day; and the children were as busy as bees preparing valentines. They
813,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"were as merry, too, as they were busy; all except Annie--little Annie,"
814,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"the delicate one, the pet of the family. While the others were skipping"
815,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"and jumping about as they did up their valentines, and eager and noisy,"
816,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"as it is the nature of children to be, Annie sat on the hearthrug, with"
817,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"her hands clasped round her little knees, staring into the red fire; and"
818,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,her pale face looked quite old and wan from trouble.
819,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
820,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"I was very hard at work directing the envelopes for the children, while"
821,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,they clamoured and clustered round me; but looking at our dear little
822,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"girl's wistful face, I took advantage of a moment's respite from my work"
823,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,to go and ask her what it was that seemed to trouble her so much.
824,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
825,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"""Oh, auntie,"" she said, as she began to cry, ""it is because Jack has"
826,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"taken my darling Tip away from me."""
827,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
828,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"Tip was a nice little Scotch terrier that belonged to Annie's cousin,"
829,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"Jack, who had been staying for two or three weeks at Annie's home during"
830,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"his holidays. Tip had come on the visit with his master, and had gone"
831,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,away with him only that morning. But during those two or three weeks Tip
832,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,and Annie had become dear friends and play-fellows.
833,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
834,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"""I had taught him so many pretty tricks,"" continued Annie, ""and he loved"
835,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"me so: I am sure, auntie dear, he loved me better than Jack."""
836,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
837,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"""But, darling,"" I said, ""after all Tip is Jack's own doggie, and he is"
838,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"very fond of the little creature, you know, so of course he took him"
839,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"away with him. Now, dear, don't fret any more, but try and be cheerful."""
840,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
841,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"Annie is a good little girl, and did try her best to be cheerful, I"
842,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"could see. She came to the table, and looked over the valentines with"
843,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,the others; but she had not forgotten her sorrows.
844,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
845,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"Presently, her little brother Tommy said to her,--""Annie, don't you hope"
846,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"you'll get a jolly lot of valentines to-morrow?"""
847,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
848,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"""I don't care,"" sighed Annie, ""unless Tip could send me one."""
849,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
850,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"""What stuff!"" remarked Tommy: ""Tip can't send you a valentine, you"
851,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"know."""
852,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
853,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"""Well, he might _bring_ me one, at any rate,"" said Annie, ""for I taught"
854,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"him to carry letters."""
855,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
856,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"Annie's remark gave me an idea, and I formed a little plan, of which you"
857,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,shall hear the result.
858,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
859,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,The next morning--St. Valentine's morning--as the children were at
860,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"breakfast in the nursery, a scratching was heard at the door; and when"
861,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"it was opened, there appeared in the doorway--what do you suppose now?"
862,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"There was a little doggie, the very likeness of Tip, standing on his"
863,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"hind legs, with a valentine in his mouth. The valentine was addressed to"
864,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"Annie: and when I followed the little terrier into the room, and told"
865,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"her that not only the valentine, but the doggie too was for her--that I"
866,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"gave it to her to be her very own, she was more delighted than I can"
867,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,describe to you.
868,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,
869,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"When I formed this little plan the day before, I had just remembered"
870,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"where a doggie, very like Tip, was for sale. I had bought him that very"
871,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,"afternoon, and managed the surprise as you see. Annie very soon grew as"
872,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,fond of Charlie--that was the name of the little dog--as she had ever
873,ST. VALENTINE'S DAY,been of Tip.

912,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,[Illustration: Decorative T]
913,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,
914,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,This is a picture of a bird called the Sparrow-hawk. It is rather a
915,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"small kind of hawk, and contents itself with swooping down upon poor"
916,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"little unoffending sparrows, and such small game. Like other birds of"
917,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"prey, it is becoming more scarce every year in England, and being a very"
918,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"wild shy bird, it does not come near people or houses if it can help it."
919,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"Still, when it is very hungry, or has little hungry bird-children at"
920,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"home in its nest, it becomes very brave and fierce, as you will see by"
921,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,the story I am going to tell you of what happened to me when I was a
922,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,little girl.
923,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,
924,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"It was, I remember, a very cold morning, and the trees were standing"
925,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"bleak and bare against the sky; the world looked dreary enough, and"
926,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,there were heavy clouds hanging over all. I had come out into the garden
927,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"to bowl my hoop, when old Tidyman, the gardener, who was sweeping the"
928,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"snow from the paths, and who dearly loved a little chat, said to me,--"
929,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,
930,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"""We'll be having a fine fall, missie, presently: it's rare and cold"
931,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,surely. The birds is a'most starving: there be a sparrer-hawk a'hoverin
932,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"over here as seems precious hungry. It have a nesty, I know, in that"
933,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"there holler tree in the park, and as soon as ever them pore little"
934,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"birds you see there trying to peck a bit, comes together, that there"
935,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"sparrer-hawk he comes after them. Looky there!"" exclaimed the old man,"
936,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"pointing to a hawk high in the air above our heads, ""if he ain't"
937,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"a'hoverin over us now!"""
938,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,
939,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"The poor little dickies, who were pecking away at a few crumbs, which"
940,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,had been thrown out to them in the garden by some kind-hearted maid
941,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"belonging to the house, seemed suddenly to become conscious of their"
942,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"danger, and flew off with a frightened twittering cry. One only--a very"
943,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,young and very foolhardy little sparrow--remained to take a last peck.
944,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"The hawk singled out this poor birdie for his prey, and allowing the"
945,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"others to fly away in peace, suddenly swooped down upon the little"
946,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"laggard, fastening his cruel beak in its poor quivering body."
947,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,
948,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,This took place within half-a-dozen yards of the spot where old Tidyman
949,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"and I stood talking. I was but a child of seven years old, but I hated"
950,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"cruelty, and always longed to help the weak against the strong; so I"
951,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"rushed at the hawk, hoopstick in hand. The little sparrow was already"
952,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"dead; but what do you think the savage hawk did? It turned upon me, and"
953,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"flew at my face. I put my hand up just in time, and had a piece pecked"
954,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,out of one of my fingers instead.
955,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,
956,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"When Tidyman came up, the horrid bird flew off, not forgetting, though,"
957,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,to pick up and carry off the little dead sparrow in triumph. I have no
958,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"doubt the baby-hawks, in their nest in the hollow tree, greeted him with"
959,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"open mouths, as you see them in the picture, and they were fed not only"
960,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,"with the little dead sparrow, but also with a nice piece out of my poor"
961,THE SPARROW-HAWK.,little finger.

978,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"Maurice. They lived in the neighbourhood of Fontainebleau, where Mr. de"
979,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"Malassise had an estate. The two families, living so far apart, were"
980,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"accustomed to pay long visits, which generally lasted some weeks, at"

983,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"Soon after Fritz had made a present of the wooden horse to Maurice, it"

986,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,forward with pleasure to this visit; for Eusèbe--that was the name of
987,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"his cousin--had a very bad temper, and my little friend found it very"
988,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"difficult to get on with him. This boy was thoroughly spoiled, and made"
989,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,everyone about him miserable by his caprices and his tyranny. His papa
990,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"and mamma did not dare to punish, or even to scold him, for they had got"
991,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"an idea into their heads that, if he was thwarted or contradicted, it"
992,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,might bring on a nervous illness.
993,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,
994,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"A country doctor being one day at the house of Mr. de Malassise, when"

999,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,remove the impression his words had produced. The parental hearts had
1000,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"taken alarm, and from that day the father and mother were always in fear"
1001,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"lest their dear boy should be put out, or anything should make him"
1002,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,angry. His wishes became laws for the whole household: at his slightest

1013,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,
1014,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"Eusèbe always had beautiful toys, and he delighted in showing them to"
1015,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,Maurice with an air of superiority that was humiliating to his little
1016,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"cousin, whose toys were common and cheap. It was only natural that the"
1017,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"latter should have some wish to retaliate, and hearing that they were"
1018,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"going to Malassise, he thought what a pleasure it would be to take"
1019,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,Cressida with him. Eusèbe could not have a toy-horse like that. Mr. de
1020,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"Roisel, however, put a stop to this project; because, as he said, if"
1021,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"Eusèbe should take a fancy to the horse, Maurice would be expected to"
1022,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,give it up to him; and that would not do at all. Maurice saw that his

1028,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,favourite plaything for the moment was a goat. Not a goat of wood or
1029,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"pasteboard, such as you children have all possessed perhaps, but a real"
1030,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,live one; as much alive as those you may see any day harnessed in
1031,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,goat-chaises in the Champs-Elysées at Paris; only she was prettier than

1040,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,Eusèbe had nothing to fear on this account. She wore round her neck a
1041,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"red collar, on which her name was embroidered in letters of gold. Eusèbe"
1042,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"would tie a string through this collar, and lead her three or four times"
1043,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"a day into a meadow near the house, where she nibbled the grass and"

1045,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,
1046,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,I cannot describe to you the delight with which Maurice watched Jeanne

1049,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"between her and Cressida. Then he looked into her soft dark eyes, which"
1050,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"appeared to express thoughts: Cressida had fine dark eyes too, but"
1051,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,somehow they were not the same thing. Jeanne liked to climb on to high
1052,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"banks, and would stand sometimes on the edge of a precipice, stretching"
1053,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,out her neck to eat the leaves of some tree: Cressida was strong upon
1054,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"the legs too, and its knees had never been marked by a fall; still it"
1055,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,could not have done so much. Out in the fields Jeanne seemed to listen
1056,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"to distant noises, which you scarcely heard; her little ears kept moving"
1057,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,about in all directions as if to let no sound escape her: Cressida had
1058,A SPOILT CHILD.--JEANNE.--MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.,"also pretty little ears, but somehow the wooden horse never seemed to"

1203,CARESS HER.],"Jeanne is not made of wood; she lives and feels like me, and it's"
1204,CARESS HER.],terrible to see lately how he beats her. You can't imagine how nice she

1289,STEPHEN.,"I was staying down in Kent with some friends of mine, when I made the"

1291,STEPHEN.,picture.
1292,STEPHEN.,
1293,STEPHEN.,"One early spring morning, towards the end of February, I went out for a"
1294,STEPHEN.,"constitutional--that is, as I daresay you know, a walk for the sake of"
1295,STEPHEN.,"one's health. I wandered off down the park into a little wood, or"
1296,STEPHEN.,"shrubbery, which had a green path winding through it, with arbours or"
1297,STEPHEN.,summer-houses placed here and there under the overhanging trees. The
1298,STEPHEN.,"wind was very keen, and patches of snow were still upon the ground,"
1299,STEPHEN.,"though the days were beginning to lengthen, and there were many signs of"
1300,STEPHEN.,"warmer weather at hand. As I walked along, I noticed now and then a"
1301,STEPHEN.,"young leaf showing itself above the ground, which told me of the coming"
1302,STEPHEN.,"primroses; and I could see green shoots, from which bluebells would soon"
1303,STEPHEN.,be springing to nod their graceful heads to the passers by.
1304,STEPHEN.,
1305,STEPHEN.,"Walking along briskly, I had nearly reached one of the little arbours,"
1306,STEPHEN.,when I observed several children standing in front of it. I knew them
1307,STEPHEN.,well by sight and name: they were the children of the lodge-keeper of
1308,STEPHEN.,"the park, and lived close by. There were four of them, and they were all"
1309,STEPHEN.,"standing staring away, as hard as their eight young eyes could stare, at"
1310,STEPHEN.,"something inside the arbour. Reaching the spot, I discovered that the"
1311,STEPHEN.,object of their curiosity was a poor little lad of about ten years of
1312,STEPHEN.,"age, who was lying on the ground with his eyes closed, and his head"
1313,STEPHEN.,"resting against the seat. He was a fair, curly-headed, pretty boy, but"
1314,STEPHEN.,"his clothes were very poor and ragged, and his little face was pinched"
1315,STEPHEN.,"and wan. I soon discovered that he was not asleep, but either benumbed"
1316,STEPHEN.,"by the cold, or insensible from exhaustion."
1317,STEPHEN.,
1318,STEPHEN.,[Illustration: Child and dog]
1319,STEPHEN.,
1320,STEPHEN.,"A little black and tan terrier, of no great value or beauty, was sitting"
1321,STEPHEN.,"by his side, seeming to watch him with great anxiety; and I was"
1322,STEPHEN.,"surprised to see also some toys lying on the ground, but these I found"
1323,STEPHEN.,"belonged to the lodge-keeper's children, who had left them in the arbour"
1324,STEPHEN.,"the day before, and had in fact come that morning to fetch them."
1325,STEPHEN.,
1326,STEPHEN.,I sent off one of the children to their father to come and carry the boy
1327,STEPHEN.,to the house. The family were just collecting at the breakfast table
1328,STEPHEN.,"when I returned from my early walk, bringing this poor little waif in"
1329,STEPHEN.,"with me. My friends took an interest in him at once, and after he had"
1330,STEPHEN.,"been well warmed and fed, he recovered sufficiently to tell us his"
1331,STEPHEN.,story.
1332,STEPHEN.,
1333,STEPHEN.,"He was a London boy, and had lived there with his mother, who earned a"
1334,STEPHEN.,"scanty subsistence for them both by needlework. At her death, two or"
1335,STEPHEN.,"three weeks before, he was left alone in the world. Then he heard the"
1336,STEPHEN.,neighbours talk of the workhouse; and having a vague dread of being sent
1337,STEPHEN.,"there, he had resolved to go right away into the country. His only"
1338,STEPHEN.,"companion was this little terrier, which had attached itself to him in"
1339,STEPHEN.,the odd way in which stray dogs will sometimes adopt a master. Begging
1340,STEPHEN.,"now and then for food at farmhouses and cottage doors, and sleeping at"
1341,STEPHEN.,"night in sheds or outhouses, he had managed in three days to come about"
1342,STEPHEN.,thirty miles from London; but he would have died from exhaustion or cold
1343,STEPHEN.,if I had not found him that morning.
1344,STEPHEN.,
1345,STEPHEN.,"This happened about two years ago, and I call him one of ""my little"
1346,STEPHEN.,"friends,"" because I still take the greatest interest in him. The family"
1347,STEPHEN.,with whom I was then staying have looked after him ever since. He was
1348,STEPHEN.,"sent to lodge at the cottage of a labourer, and goes to the village"
1349,STEPHEN.,"school, where he is such a good boy and so quick at his lessons, that I"
1350,STEPHEN.,have no doubt he will get on well in the world.

1389,MOKO.,"Aunt Totty is an old maid--I need not say how old,--and very fond of"
1390,MOKO.,"birds and animals, which she professes to think are sometimes very"
1391,MOKO.,"superior to men. At her own home, which is at Paris, she has quite a"
1392,MOKO.,"collection of pets. She often comes to England, however, to visit her"
1393,MOKO.,"relations, and then her little nephews and nieces--for she likes"
1394,MOKO.,"children too--always get round her, and make her tell them stories about"
1395,MOKO.,"her animals or birds. One evening, when the children were gathered round"
1396,MOKO.,"her, she began in this way:--"
1397,MOKO.,
1398,MOKO.,"""You want to hear about my pets, my dears? Very well: I shall have"
1399,MOKO.,pleasure in telling you all about them; for although I have had some
1400,MOKO.,"bites and scratches and pecks from them now and then, on the whole they"
1401,MOKO.,"are very estimable. In fact, they possess some qualities which I should"
1402,MOKO.,"be very glad to see oftener than I do in men and women: yes, and in"
1403,MOKO.,little children too.
1404,MOKO.,
1405,MOKO.,"""The first pet animal I can remember was a monkey. I was then quite"
1406,MOKO.,"little, not more than five or six years old; and Moko--that was the"
1407,MOKO.,monkey's name--was almost as big as I was. I really think he considered
1408,MOKO.,that he and I were of the same species: at all events he used to treat
1409,MOKO.,me as a companion and an equal. But before Moko joined our family
1410,MOKO.,"circle, we were very near having another monkey, who was not so amiable;"
1411,MOKO.,and I think I will begin by telling you about him.
1412,MOKO.,
1413,MOKO.,"""In those days--that is, when your mamma and I and your two uncles were"
1414,MOKO.,"all children--you know that we used generally to live in France, and one"
1415,MOKO.,summer your grandpapa took a country house a few miles out of Paris.
1416,MOKO.,"Well, on a beautiful warm morning, when we children were all playing in"
1417,MOKO.,"the large garden, we heard the sound of an organ; and soon we saw,"
1418,MOKO.,"coming through the white gates and playing as he came, an organ-man,"
1419,MOKO.,with a monkey sitting on the organ. A shout of delight resounded through
1420,MOKO.,"the garden. When the new-comers approached we were even more delighted,"
1421,MOKO.,for the monkey was dressed up in the funniest way possible. He looked
1422,MOKO.,"like a tiny old man, with a cocked hat, long red coat, blue breeches,"
1423,MOKO.,"and a little pair of boots upon his feet, laced up with red laces."
1424,MOKO.,
1425,MOKO.,[Illustration: Monkey on banister]
1426,MOKO.,
1427,MOKO.,"""The monkey performed all manner of tricks: he danced, he fired off a"
1428,MOKO.,"little musket, went through the sword exercise, put on spectacles and"
1429,MOKO.,"pretended to read the newspaper, and did a great deal more besides."
1430,MOKO.,"After witnessing these wonderful performances, we conducted both monkey"
1431,MOKO.,"and man into the drawing-room, where our mamma was sitting at the open"
1432,MOKO.,"window, and we all began in chorus:--'Oh, mamma dear, pray, _pray_ buy"
1433,MOKO.,this monkey for us; he is such a darling!'
1434,MOKO.,
1435,MOKO.,"""Now, we were all, as children, very fond of animals,--though I am the"
1436,MOKO.,"only one, I think, who has the same liking still--and our mamma used"
1437,MOKO.,"rather to encourage us in it. In fact, we had almost a menagerie"
1438,MOKO.,"already, and this was not the first time we had teazed mamma to let us"
1439,MOKO.,"have a monkey. She seemed inclined to give way, and asked the organ-man"
1440,MOKO.,if he would sell it. He hesitated: apparently a little struggle was
1441,MOKO.,"going on in his own conscience, but his honesty prevailed, and he"
1442,MOKO.,"confessed that, except in his presence, and under his control, the"
1443,MOKO.,monkey was both mischievous and savage.
1444,MOKO.,
1445,MOKO.,"""All this time the creature stood in front of a large looking-glass,"
1446,MOKO.,bowing and scraping to his own reflection; and mamma appearing to doubt
1447,MOKO.,"this bad character of the seemingly amiable monkey, the man at last"
1448,MOKO.,"said:--'Let me leave him, madam, for a moment, and you shall judge.'"
1449,MOKO.,
1450,MOKO.,"""The man immediately hid himself behind a sofa. When the monkey looked"
1451,MOKO.,"round, and no longer saw his master, the very expression of his"
1452,MOKO.,"withered, wrinkled little face began to change,--from an expression of"
1453,MOKO.,good-temper it changed to one of fury. He at once jumped upon the
1454,MOKO.,"mantelpiece, and before anyone had time to prevent it, he dashed the"
1455,MOKO.,"clock against the looking-glass, smashing both. My mother seizing him to"
1456,MOKO.,"prevent more mischief, he scratched and bit her cruelly, till he heard"
1457,MOKO.,"his master's voice, and saw his stern face and uplifted arm. Then in a"
1458,MOKO.,second he became the amiable tractable creature he had been before; but
1459,MOKO.,you may be sure we were glad to get rid of the horrid little animal.
1460,MOKO.,
1461,MOKO.,"""However, we still wanted a monkey; and great was our joy when papa"
1462,MOKO.,"brought us Moko. He bought him of a sailor, who declared he was as"
1463,MOKO.,"gentle and obedient as any dog, and had been the pet of the whole crew"
1464,MOKO.,of the ship he had come over in. And I must say Moko was as nearly
1465,MOKO.,"perfect as anyone I know, for he had but one fault: he was very greedy."
1466,MOKO.,I remember one day a box full of fine pears had been left in the hall
1467,MOKO.,"near the foot of the staircase, and we found Moko hanging by his tail to"
1468,MOKO.,"the balusters, and helping himself to the pears. He was eating them in"
1469,MOKO.,that uncomfortable position: his cheek stuck out from the quantity he
1470,MOKO.,had stuffed into his mouth; and we found afterwards that he had besides
1471,MOKO.,stowed away a good many under the staircase as a future provision.
1472,MOKO.,
1473,MOKO.,"""I have a painful recollection of Moko stealing bread and jam away from"
1474,MOKO.,me. He used to come behind me quite quietly when I was sitting at the
1475,MOKO.,"table at breakfast or tea, and climbing on to the back of my little"
1476,MOKO.,"chair, he would stretch his long hairy arm over my shoulder, and snatch"
1477,MOKO.,the bread and jam away before I knew he was there. He always selected me
1478,MOKO.,"to attack, I suppose because I was the smallest."
1479,MOKO.,
1480,MOKO.,"""In spite of this fault, we all loved Moko very much. He was petted by"
1481,MOKO.,"the whole household. He used to join us children in our games, and"
1482,MOKO.,always appeared to take pains not to hurt us. He was allowed to play
1483,MOKO.,"about the garden just as he pleased, for he would always come back when"
1484,MOKO.,"he was called; and it was pretty to see him climbing from tree to tree,"
1485,MOKO.,"or hanging on to a branch by his tail, and swinging backwards and"
1486,MOKO.,"forwards."""

1528,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"I have already told you, my little ones, how our Lord Jesus Christ"
1529,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,turned the water into wine at the marriage feast. That was His first
1530,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"miracle, and one of the few He performed which were not works of"
1531,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"healing; for He went about curing the sick, and in some instances"
1532,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,restoring to life those who were already dead.
1533,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,
1534,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"We are told in the Bible that after this first miracle, our Saviour left"
1535,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"Cana and went to Jerusalem to keep the Passover, and it is stated that"
1536,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"while there He performed several miracles in the way of healing, which"
1537,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,were so wonderful that His fame spread throughout the land. After the
1538,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"Passover, Christ left Jerusalem, and turned His steps towards Galilee."
1539,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,
1540,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"Now in a city of Galilee, called Capernaum, there lived a nobleman, who"
1541,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"had an only child, a son, that he loved with his whole heart. The child"
1542,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,was very ill--so ill that there was no hope of recovery. The little face
1543,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"that the poor father loved so much grew pale and wan, and the pretty"
1544,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,bright eyes lost their brightness. Everything that human skill could do
1545,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,had been tried in vain; but the father had heard of the miracles done by
1546,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"Jesus in Jerusalem, and knowing that He was then passing through that"
1547,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"part of the country, he left the bedside of his dying child, and came"
1548,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,himself to Christ.
1549,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,
1550,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"St. John tells us--""He besought Christ that He would come down and heal"
1551,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"his son; for he was at the point of death. Then said Jesus unto him,"
1552,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,Except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe. The nobleman saith
1553,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"unto Him, Sir, come down ere my child die. Jesus saith unto him, Go thy"
1554,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,way: thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken
1555,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"unto him, and he went his way."""
1556,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,
1557,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,From this account it appears as if the nobleman went to our Saviour only
1558,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"as a last resource, and scarcely believing in His power. This was why"
1559,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"Christ said as a sort of reproof, ""Except ye see signs and wonders ye"
1560,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"will not believe."" Then the poor father prayed again to Him to _come_ to"
1561,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"his son, thinking that to save the boy our Saviour must see and touch"
1562,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,him. But Christ showed him that He could heal the boy as well at a
1563,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"distance as near, and said, ""Go thy way: thy son liveth."""
1564,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,
1565,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"This man's faith, you see, had grown suddenly, and became perfect; for"
1566,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"he believed without hesitation our Saviour's word, and returned home at"
1567,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"once. He did not stay to question, but he went home, taking it for"
1568,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"granted that he would find the miracle performed, and that his son was"
1569,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"living as Jesus had declared, although this was the first instance in"
1570,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,which Christ had healed at a distance.
1571,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,
1572,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"He believed so firmly that all would be well when he got home, that he"
1573,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,does not appear even to have hurried on his journey; and he met some of
1574,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,his servants the next day before he reached his house. The servants had
1575,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"come out to meet him, and they were the bearers of the happy tidings of"
1576,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,his son's recovery. Then he anxiously inquired when the child began to
1577,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"get better, and they told him: ""Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever"
1578,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"left him."" And the father knew it was at that hour Christ had said to"
1579,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"him, ""Thy son liveth."" From that time, St. John tells us the nobleman"
1580,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,and all his household were believers.
1581,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,
1582,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"We learn, my dear children, from this miracle that sorrow and trouble"
1583,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,often lead to good. They brought the anxious and sorrowing father to
1584,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,"Christ, and caused not only the father but all the household to become"
1585,THE NOBLEMAN'S SON HEALED.,believers. Let us trust and pray that through such suffering and such

1601,JACK AND JERRY.,
1602,JACK AND JERRY.,From the heading of this page you would scarcely know which I call my
1603,JACK AND JERRY.,"little friend--Jack the boy, or Jerry the donkey. Friends of mine indeed"
1604,JACK AND JERRY.,they both are; but I think I am fond of Jerry chiefly on account of the
1605,JACK AND JERRY.,love he bears his little master.
1606,JACK AND JERRY.,
1607,JACK AND JERRY.,Jack is the oldest of a large family of boys and girls; he is only ten
1608,JACK AND JERRY.,"years of age, but there are six other children, all younger than he is."
1609,JACK AND JERRY.,On his fifth birthday he had a rocking-horse given him: it came down
1610,JACK AND JERRY.,"from London, for Jack's home is far away in the country. How delighted"
1611,JACK AND JERRY.,"the little boy was when the horse stood in the hall, covered up with"
1612,JACK AND JERRY.,"thick brown paper! He knew it was addressed to him, for he could already"
1613,JACK AND JERRY.,"read writing when it was large. Then, as the brown paper was taken off,"
1614,JACK AND JERRY.,what a jumping and shouting there was: for the other little ones had
1615,JACK AND JERRY.,come down from the nursery to see the gee-gee.
1616,JACK AND JERRY.,
1617,JACK AND JERRY.,"You all know what a large handsome rocking-horse is like, so I need not"
1618,JACK AND JERRY.,describe it; and you can imagine what a deal of amusement and pleasure
1619,JACK AND JERRY.,"it afforded Jack for a while. However, as time went on, fresh little"
1620,JACK AND JERRY.,"brothers and sisters arrived quickly; and each in turn, as he or she"
1621,JACK AND JERRY.,"grew old enough, began to take delight in the gee-gee; until at last my"
1622,JACK AND JERRY.,friend Jack scarcely ever had the chance of a ride. And I must say the
1623,JACK AND JERRY.,"poor horse looked old and battered, and very different from what it had"
1624,JACK AND JERRY.,looked when only used by my little friend.
1625,JACK AND JERRY.,
1626,JACK AND JERRY.,"One day he said to me sadly:--""You see I am getting big for it now, and"
1627,JACK AND JERRY.,"there are so many of the little ones to ride, so I give it up: the poor"
1628,JACK AND JERRY.,"gee-gee is worked hard enough as it is."""
1629,JACK AND JERRY.,
1630,JACK AND JERRY.,"Jack was always willing to let the children ride his horse, but, worn"
1631,JACK AND JERRY.,"and damaged though it was, he could not bear to see them ill-use it. I"
1632,JACK AND JERRY.,"have noticed the child wince as if with pain, when his sturdy brother"
1633,JACK AND JERRY.,Maurice made a great piece of paint drop off with a heavy crack from his
1634,JACK AND JERRY.,"whip. ""If the boy is so sensitive about a rocking-horse,"" thought I,"
1635,JACK AND JERRY.,"""how careful and kind he would be, if he had a real pony or donkey."""
1636,JACK AND JERRY.,
1637,JACK AND JERRY.,"When I proposed to give Jack a pony, his mamma said she thought he was"
1638,JACK AND JERRY.,"not old enough to ride one yet, and seemed nervous about it, so I made"
1639,JACK AND JERRY.,"up my mind that a donkey it should be. I made inquiries, and soon found"
1640,JACK AND JERRY.,"a dear little creature, which I thought so pretty that I bought it at"
1641,JACK AND JERRY.,"once. It was very young, and had never before left its mother. Jack"
1642,JACK AND JERRY.,"named it Jerry: he took such care of it, and made such a pet of the"
1643,JACK AND JERRY.,"little animal, that it would come at his call, and follow him about, and"
1644,JACK AND JERRY.,"obey him, just like a large dog."
1645,JACK AND JERRY.,
1646,JACK AND JERRY.,"I remember one day, when we were all sitting at lunch, we heard, patter,"
1647,JACK AND JERRY.,"patter, patter on the floorcloth of the hall. Presently the door, which"
1648,JACK AND JERRY.,"was not closed, opened a little way. A soft mouse-coloured nose"
1649,JACK AND JERRY.,"presented itself, followed by a rough hairy face, with a pair of soft"
1650,JACK AND JERRY.,"full bright eyes, and after these came two long ears; then the whole of"
1651,JACK AND JERRY.,Master Jerry's head looked round the corner at us. We all burst out
1652,JACK AND JERRY.,"laughing, as you may easily suppose; when the donkey, thinking to join"
1653,JACK AND JERRY.,"in the merriment, put up his head, and raised such a ""Heehaw! heehaw!"""
1654,JACK AND JERRY.,"that we were obliged to clap our hands over our ears, and the whole"
1655,JACK AND JERRY.,"house, I may almost say the neighbourhood, rang with the sound."
1656,JACK AND JERRY.,
1657,JACK AND JERRY.,"As soon as Jerry was big and strong enough to be ridden, I made Jack a"
1658,JACK AND JERRY.,present of a bridle and saddle. He used to ride about in the park and
1659,JACK AND JERRY.,"lanes; but when they came home, Jack never forgot to give Jerry a few"

1715,SQUIRRELS.,
1716,SQUIRRELS.,"I happened to be up very early one morning, long before breakfast was"
1717,SQUIRRELS.,"ready, or any of the family were down, and I went out into the garden to"
1718,SQUIRRELS.,enjoy the fresh sweet smell of the early day. The cows were grazing in
1719,SQUIRRELS.,"the field beyond, and now and then lowing a friendly ""good-morning"" to"
1720,SQUIRRELS.,"each other. Some ducks were waddling in procession down to the pond,"
1721,SQUIRRELS.,quacking out their wise remarks as they went. The little birds were
1722,SQUIRRELS.,singing lustily their welcome to the new-born day. Even the old
1723,SQUIRRELS.,"watch-dog came yawning, stretching, blinking, and wagging his tail in"
1724,SQUIRRELS.,"kindly dog-fashion, to bid me ""good-day"" in the summer sunshine."
1725,SQUIRRELS.,
1726,SQUIRRELS.,"As I stood under the great beech trees, taking in with greedy eye and"
1727,SQUIRRELS.,"ear the sights and sounds of country life so refreshing to a Londoner, I"
1728,SQUIRRELS.,"heard something fall from one of the trees, then a scuffle, and"
1729,SQUIRRELS.,"immediately afterwards a white Persian cat, belonging to the house,"
1730,SQUIRRELS.,bounded towards me in hot pursuit of a dear little squirrel. I was just
1731,SQUIRRELS.,in time to save the poor little animal by stepping between it and the
1732,SQUIRRELS.,"cat. The squirrel passed under the edge of my dress, and made off again"
1733,SQUIRRELS.,up another tree; so pussy lost her prey.
1734,SQUIRRELS.,
1735,SQUIRRELS.,"Soon afterwards, when we were at breakfast, the butler told us that one"
1736,SQUIRRELS.,"of the little boys of the village, who had lost a pet squirrel, had"
1737,SQUIRRELS.,asked if he might look for it in the garden of the house. It had first
1738,SQUIRRELS.,"escaped into some trees in the park, and he had traced it from them into"
1739,SQUIRRELS.,the garden. It at once occurred to me that this must be the little
1740,SQUIRRELS.,creature I had saved from the cat. I remembered how it made straight
1741,SQUIRRELS.,"towards me, as if asking me for protection from its enemy, which only a"
1742,SQUIRRELS.,"tame squirrel would do; and I proposed, when breakfast was over, that we"
1743,SQUIRRELS.,should go out and help in the search.
1744,SQUIRRELS.,
1745,SQUIRRELS.,"Little Jack Tompkins stood under the beech trees, looking with"
1746,SQUIRRELS.,tear-stained face up into the branches. Suddenly I saw his face
1747,SQUIRRELS.,"brighten, and he called out: ""I see un, ma'am; I see un! If so be no one"
1748,SQUIRRELS.,"warn't by, I be sure he'd come to I."""
1749,SQUIRRELS.,
1750,SQUIRRELS.,I need not say we retreated to a distance; then Jack called up the tree
1751,SQUIRRELS.,"in a loud whisper: ""Billee, Billee!"" and in a minute down came the"
1752,SQUIRRELS.,little creature on to his shoulder. I can tell you Jack was a happier
1753,SQUIRRELS.,child than he had been when he came into the garden. And when I told him
1754,SQUIRRELS.,"what a narrow escape ""Billee"" had had from the cat, he said: ""It would"
1755,SQUIRRELS.,"be hard if a cat eat he, for our old puss brought he up with her own"
1756,SQUIRRELS.,"kits."" Then he told us how the squirrel, when a tiny thing, had dropped"
1757,SQUIRRELS.,"out of its nest, and been found by him lying almost dead at the foot of"
1758,SQUIRRELS.,"a tree, and how he had carried it home, and tried whether pussy would"
1759,SQUIRRELS.,adopt it as one of her own kittens. The cat was kind; the squirrel
1760,SQUIRRELS.,"throve under her motherly care, and became Jack's pet and companion."
1761,SQUIRRELS.,
1762,SQUIRRELS.,"Now, children, in this instance it was all very well to keep a tame"
1763,SQUIRRELS.,"squirrel. ""Billee"" seemed happy, leading the life he was accustomed to:"
1764,SQUIRRELS.,"he had been fed and cared for by human beings from his infancy, and"
1765,SQUIRRELS.,"might be as incapable of finding food, and managing for himself, in a"
1766,SQUIRRELS.,"wild state, as a poor canary would be if let loose from its cage. But"
1767,SQUIRRELS.,generally it is cruel to imprison little wild birds and animals who have
1768,SQUIRRELS.,known the enjoyment of liberty.
1769,SQUIRRELS.,
1770,SQUIRRELS.,"Squirrels are interesting little creatures. Besides being so pretty,"
1771,SQUIRRELS.,"bright-eyed, and active, they are remarkably intelligent. They make"
1772,SQUIRRELS.,"their nests in trees as birds do, but with even more ingenuity than most"
1773,SQUIRRELS.,"birds. The materials of the nest are moss, leaves, grass, and fibres of"
1774,SQUIRRELS.,"the bark of trees, all neatly woven together. The nest is waterproof,"
1775,SQUIRRELS.,"and secure from the roughest gale of wind; it is, besides, carefully"
1776,SQUIRRELS.,hidden from the view of any passer-by beneath. The food of squirrels
1777,SQUIRRELS.,"consists of vegetables, nuts, acorns, and other fruits and seeds. These"
1778,SQUIRRELS.,little animals have the forethought to lay up provisions for the winter;
1779,SQUIRRELS.,"and not only do they keep a little store in their nests, but in any hole"
1780,SQUIRRELS.,they may chance to find in the surrounding trees. Sometimes they have a
1781,SQUIRRELS.,dozen secret storehouses within a few leaps of their nest.

1800,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,I'll tell it as 'twas told to me.
1801,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"A man once lived whose name was Nocket,"

1809,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,A treatise he had written too

1811,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,May well suppose he heard with glee
1812,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,A garden-show there was to be;
1813,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,And that a prize among the rest
1814,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,Would be awarded for the best
1815,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,And largest pumpkin at the show.
1816,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"""Ha! ha!"" thought Nocket, ""now I'll grow"
1817,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,A pumpkin shall be such a size
1818,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"It will be sure to gain the prize."""
1819,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"In hothouse, where the heat was greater"
1820,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"Almost than in Mount Etna's crater,"
1821,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"The pumpkin grew, and grew so fine"
1822,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,That Nocket asked his friends to dine.
1823,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,And showed it to them all with pride.
1824,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"""Magnificent!"" the friends replied;"
1825,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"Excepting one, who looked quite sly,"
1826,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"And said, ""You'll see mine, by-and-by."""
1827,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"'Twas Nocket's next door neighbour, Wright,"
1828,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,Who spoke those words: and all that night
1829,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"Nocket slept not; spiteful and sad,"
1830,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,At length he formed a purpose bad:
1831,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"At early dawn, without a fall"
1832,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"He clambered o'er the garden wall,"
1833,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"And of Wright's greenhouse ope'd the door,"
1834,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,Laid his own pumpkin on the floor;
1835,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"There found the biggest ever seen,"
1836,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,Compared to which his own look'd mean.
1837,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,Upon his head with might and main
1838,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"He hoisted, it; and once again"
1839,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,He climbed the wall. Then found--worse luck!--
1840,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,The pumpkin on his shoulders stuck.
1841,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,"In vain he wriggled, struggled, fought,"
1842,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,His head was in the pumpkin caught;
1843,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,And from that day the thing stuck fast
1844,PUMPKIN-HEAD.,On Nocket's neck. 'Tis sometime past;

2275,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,After our Saviour had healed the nobleman's son--the miracle I described

2277,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"Cana and went to Capernaum, a town on the shore of the lake, or sea, of"
2278,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,Galilee. The country surrounding this beautiful lake is now desolate and
2279,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"barren; but at the time when our Saviour lived upon earth, it was"
2280,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,fertile and thickly populated. On the banks of the lake were towns and
2281,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"villages; on its waters boats plied, engaged in pleasure or trade; and"
2282,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,many fishermen carried on their calling.
2283,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,
2284,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"One evening our Lord walked on the shore of the lake, teaching His"
2285,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"disciples, when He found Himself surrounded by a multitude of people."
2286,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"They pressed about Him, eager to hear Him preach; and in order to let"
2287,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"them hear and see Him better, He entered into one of the fishing-boats"
2288,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,which belonged to Simon Peter. And Christ prayed Simon Peter to thrust
2289,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"out the boat a little from the land: then He sat down, and taught the"
2290,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,people from the boat.
2291,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,
2292,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,We are not told what was the particular purport of His teaching on this

2294,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,more impressive by performing a miracle before the eyes of all the
2295,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"people. He turned to Simon, and told him to cast forth his nets to catch"
2296,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"fish; upon which, St. Luke tells us, Simon answered: ""Master, we have"
2297,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,toiled all the night and have taken nothing; nevertheless at thy word I

2300,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,This is the language of obedience and faith. The net was at once cast
2301,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"into the sea, and it enclosed such a quantity of fish that it began to"
2302,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"break. In the boat with Christ, besides Simon Peter, was another"
2303,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"fisherman, named Andrew; and they beckoned to their partners, James and"
2304,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"John, the sons of Zebedee, who were in another boat, to come to their"
2305,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,assistance. Both boats were filled so full of fish that they were almost

2309,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,draught of fishes made upon the multitude that were looking on from the
2310,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,shore; but the first thought of Simon Peter seems to have been a sense
2311,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"of his own unworthiness. Falling down at our Saviour's feet, he cried:"
2312,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"""Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord."""
2313,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,
2314,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"With mingled feelings of humility, gratitude, and awe, he entreated"
2315,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,Jesus to depart from one who was so guilty and undeserving. But he did
2316,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"not know the love of Christ towards him, or the gracious design of this"
2317,THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.,"miracle. His fears were soon calmed. ""Fear not,"" said Jesus to His"

2377,RUBY.,"in some unknown language, while now and then he threw a handful of"
2378,RUBY.,crackers among the children to be scrambled for.
2379,RUBY.,
2380,RUBY.,Presently an enormous figure appeared stooping to come through the door
2381,RUBY.,"of the room. He was covered up with a long cloak, and was an oddly made"
2382,RUBY.,"giant too, for his shoulders seemed to stick out little more than"
2383,RUBY.,"half-way up him, and he had a tiny little face, with a voice much weaker"
2384,RUBY.,than the dwarf's. He stalked up to the dwarf's table and stood beside
2385,RUBY.,"him. At last a little boy of the party, being very curious, lifted up"
2386,RUBY.,"the giant's cloak to peep beneath, but happening to pull it at the same"
2387,RUBY.,"time, down it fell, and there stood Ruby's papa again, with her little"
2388,RUBY.,brother Johnnie on his shoulders.
2389,RUBY.,
2390,RUBY.,"And now the boys were becoming uproarious, and tried to peep behind the"
2391,RUBY.,"curtain to find out how the dwarf was made, when their attention was"
2392,RUBY.,"attracted by the sound of a fiddle playing outside. They saw, in the"
2393,RUBY.,"fading light of evening, a poor blind man being led up the carriage"
2394,RUBY.,drive by a barefooted little girl about the size of Ruby. As the blind
2395,RUBY.,fiddler and his little girl turned the corner of the drive towards the
2396,RUBY.,"hall-door, they passed out of sight from the drawing-room windows, and I"
2397,RUBY.,observed that Ruby and three or four other children ran into the hall to
2398,RUBY.,"meet them. The boys, however, turned once more to pursue their"
2399,RUBY.,"investigations concerning the dwarf, and were becoming quite riotous,"
2400,RUBY.,"when I thought I might as well see what was going on in the hall, for I"
2401,RUBY.,heard the fiddler playing lustily.
2402,RUBY.,
2403,RUBY.,"Entering the hall, what do you suppose I saw? I saw Ruby and four or"
2404,RUBY.,"five other little girls, including the fiddler's child among them,"
2405,RUBY.,dancing away with all their might to the inspiriting music of the
2406,RUBY.,"fiddle, fiddler and children seeming as happy as possible together. But"
2407,RUBY.,the strangest sight of all was to see Ruby's pretty blue shoes upon the
2408,RUBY.,"dirty stockingless feet of the fiddler's child, while Ruby herself had"
2409,RUBY.,only her white silk socks to dance in.
2410,RUBY.,
2411,RUBY.,"Dear little Ruby! hers was the true spirit of charity, though certainly"
2412,RUBY.,not well directed.

2683,DISTRESS.--WHAT OUGHT MAURICE TO DO?,
2684,DISTRESS.--WHAT OUGHT MAURICE TO DO?,Maurice thought for a moment of going home to his mother to ask her for

2712,DISTRESS.--WHAT OUGHT MAURICE TO DO?,"prosperous, and they were going to join him. Their baggage had been"
2713,DISTRESS.--WHAT OUGHT MAURICE TO DO?,"already seat on from Nuremburg to Nantes, and put on board the vessel in"

2717,DISTRESS.--WHAT OUGHT MAURICE TO DO?,"She said that when they got out of the train at Paris that morning, they"

2719,DISTRESS.--WHAT OUGHT MAURICE TO DO?,"which contained, besides some change of linen, all the money they had."
2720,DISTRESS.--WHAT OUGHT MAURICE TO DO?,It had either been stolen or lost in the confusion of getting out of the

2771,DISTRESS.--WHAT OUGHT MAURICE TO DO?,
2772,DISTRESS.--WHAT OUGHT MAURICE TO DO?,This picture of the probable future in store for the little horse was

2777,DISTRESS.--WHAT OUGHT MAURICE TO DO?,If the actors in this scene had not been so engrossed with the matter

2858,TEASING TOM.,"Another day he put some bran into her teapot, and nurse wondered why her"

2861,TEASING TOM.,into a fit.
2862,TEASING TOM.,
2863,TEASING TOM.,One day there was a child's party. It was sister Mary's birthday. When

2882,HERONS.,
2883,HERONS.,To-day our natural history picture shows three very funny long-legged
2884,HERONS.,"birds; they look at first sight very like storks, but these birds are"
2885,HERONS.,herons.
2886,HERONS.,
2887,HERONS.,"The heron, though much less common than in former days, still holds its"
2888,HERONS.,"place among familiar British birds, being occasionally seen on the banks"
2889,HERONS.,"of almost every river or lake. This bird is about three feet in length,"
2890,HERONS.,"the bill being longer than the head, and the wings when spread measure"
2891,HERONS.,five feet across; with these large strong wings it can fly to a great
2892,HERONS.,"height. The heron lives on fish, which it swallows whole, and in great"
2893,HERONS.,"numbers; it can neither swim nor dive, but it wades into the water as"
2894,HERONS.,"far as its long legs will carry it with safety, and stands there as"
2895,HERONS.,"still as if carved out of wood, with its long neck drawn in, and its"
2896,HERONS.,head resting between the shoulders. It will watch with patience for
2897,HERONS.,"hours till a fish or a frog comes within its reach, when it stretches"
2898,HERONS.,"out its long neck suddenly, and snatches up its prey with its sharp"
2899,HERONS.,"bill. It mostly prefers to stand under the shadow of a tree, bush, or"
2900,HERONS.,"bank; and from its perfect stillness, and the sober colour of its"
2901,HERONS.,"plumage, it seems often to escape the observation even of the fish"
2902,HERONS.,themselves.
2903,HERONS.,
2904,HERONS.,"In old times in England, the sport called hawking, which consisted in"
2905,HERONS.,"the chase of herons by hawks or falcons trained for the purpose, was a"
2906,HERONS.,very favourite one among both gentlemen and ladies. Young hawks procured
2907,HERONS.,"from their nests in Iceland or Norway, and carefully trained, were of"
2908,HERONS.,"great value. The sport was generally enjoyed on horseback, and both"
2909,HERONS.,ladies and gentlemen usually carried the hawks perched upon their
2910,HERONS.,"wrists, the birds' heads being covered with a hood till the moment came"
2911,HERONS.,for letting them fly.
2912,HERONS.,
2913,HERONS.,"When the heron was discovered, he would soon become aware of the"
2914,HERONS.,"approach of the hawking party; and spreading his broad wings, and"
2915,HERONS.,"stretching out his long neck in front, and his long legs behind, would"
2916,HERONS.,"rise majestically in the air. Then the hawk's hood was removed, and as"
2917,HERONS.,"soon as he caught sight of the heron, he was let fly in pursuit."
2918,HERONS.,
2919,HERONS.,"Now a hawk cannot strike unless it is above its prey, and the heron"
2920,HERONS.,seems instinctively to be aware of this. It used to be thought a fine
2921,HERONS.,sight to see these two birds striving to rise each above the other.
2922,HERONS.,"Round and round they went, wheeling in a succession of circles, always"
2923,HERONS.,higher and higher. At length the hawk rose high enough to shoot down
2924,HERONS.,upon the heron. Sometimes he was received upon the long sharp bill of
2925,HERONS.,"the latter, and simply spitted himself; but generally he would break the"
2926,HERONS.,"wing of the heron, or clutch him with beak and claws, when the two came"
2927,HERONS.,fluttering down together.
2928,HERONS.,
2929,HERONS.,"This sport has now fallen into disuse, and English herons lead a"
2930,HERONS.,"peaceful life enough. There are some at the Zoological gardens, and I"
2931,HERONS.,think you will laugh to see them standing there at the edge of their
2932,HERONS.,"pond, with heads sunk between their shoulders, looking like long-nosed"

2951,COCO AND MARQUIS.,
2952,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"""Yes, my dears,"" said Aunt Totty, ""Marquis was certainly a splendid"
2953,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"animal; as large as a fine horse, as strong as a bull, and wonderfully"
2954,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"fleet. We used to drive him about in a light two-wheeled carriage, a"
2955,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"kind of cabriolet, which was the carriage most used in that part of"
2956,COCO AND MARQUIS.,France in those days. I must tell you that what I am going to relate
2957,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"happened when I was quite a little child, which of course is a long time"
2958,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"ago, and we were living at the time in a chateau, or large"
2959,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"country-house, in the south of France. There were large forests in that"
2960,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"part of the country, and the house was a long way off from any town."

2963,COCO AND MARQUIS.,
2964,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"""Now, handsome and strong Marquis certainly was, but that was about all"
2965,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"you could say in his favour, for he had a detestable temper. I hardly"
2966,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"know why I call Marquis one of my pets, for we children were never"
2967,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"allowed to drive him, hardly even to stroke him, lest he should kick or"
2968,COCO AND MARQUIS.,bite; and he was addicted to both these bad habits. Whenever he thought
2969,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"he had hurt anyone, or done mischief of any kind, you might see him"
2970,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"shake all over, as if he was having a good quiet laugh all to himself."
2971,COCO AND MARQUIS.,Once he succeeded in breaking the traces and getting free from the
2972,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"carriage: then he indulged in something more than a quiet chuckle, and"
2973,COCO AND MARQUIS.,fell to neighing or braying--for I hardly know which to call it--with
2974,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"all his might, till we were nearly deafened by the horrid noise. I"
2975,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"remember another occasion, when he succeeded in upsetting the little"
2976,COCO AND MARQUIS.,carriage and breaking the shafts. My mother and I and the coachman were
2977,COCO AND MARQUIS.,all thrown out. Luckily we were not much hurt; and while we were picking
2978,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"ourselves up, Marquis stood looking at us with an air of triumph, and"
2979,COCO AND MARQUIS.,amused himself by kicking up the dust with his hoofs till we were almost
2980,COCO AND MARQUIS.,smothered.
2981,COCO AND MARQUIS.,
2982,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"""Marquis had, however, one tender place in his heart, and that was"
2983,COCO AND MARQUIS.,occupied by our dog Coco. Coco was a spaniel; no great beauty perhaps;
2984,COCO AND MARQUIS.,but he was as good and amiable as Marquis was the reverse. How two
2985,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"creatures so unlike in disposition--one so good-hearted, the other so"
2986,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"vicious--could have struck up such a friendship, I never could make out."
2987,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"If Coco went into the field where Marquis was grazing, the mule would"
2988,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"run up to him directly, and I have even seen the two rub their noses"
2989,COCO AND MARQUIS.,together as if they were kissing. Coco had a comfortable bed in the
2990,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"kitchen, but he preferred at night going to sleep upon the straw in the"
2991,COCO AND MARQUIS.,little out-house which served as a stable for Marquis.

2993,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"""The winter we were at the chateau happened to be unusually severe, and"
2994,COCO AND MARQUIS.,snow was on the ground for many days. It was always known that there
2995,COCO AND MARQUIS.,"were wolves in the forest, though they were rarely seen; but during the"

3058,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"Our Saviour's next miracle, after the miraculous draught of fishes which"
3059,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"I described in our last Sunday talk, took place also at Capernaum, and"
3060,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,consisted in healing the mother of the wife of Simon Peter the
3061,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"fisherman. Peter had become a disciple of Jesus, and indeed was soon"
3062,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,afterwards created one of the twelve apostles. The Master often visited
3063,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"the house of His disciple; and one day on entering it, He was told that"
3064,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,Peter's wife's mother lay seriously ill. Christ immediately went into
3065,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"the room of the sick woman; stood over her, and holding her hand, bade"
3066,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"the fever leave her. She arose at once from her bed, perfectly well; not"
3067,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"merely better; not weak, as people usually are on first recovering from"
3068,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"a fever, but quite well. St. Matthew says of her:--""And she arose and"
3069,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"ministered to them:"" meaning that she was able to get up and attend to"
3070,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,her household duties as usual.

3072,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"Our Saviour now went down to Nazareth, where, as you know, my dear"

3074,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"unknown and in poverty. He there performed many wonderful miracles,"
3075,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"healing the sick, and doing good to the poor or afflicted who came to"
3076,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,Him. But you must not expect me to describe to you all His wonderful
3077,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"works of this kind; I shall tell you only of the most important, that"
3078,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"you may learn the loving kindness and mercy of Him who ""bore our sins"
3079,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"and carried our sorrows."""
3080,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,
3081,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"It often happened on the Sabbath, in the cool of the evening, that the"
3082,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,sick were brought out on their beds or couches to Jesus to be healed.
3083,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"They were not brought till the sun was setting, for fear of breaking the"
3084,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,commandment which forbids all manner of work on the Sabbath: but the
3085,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"Jewish Sabbath ending at the setting of the sun, people did not scruple"
3086,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,to bring their sick to be healed by Jesus after that hour. And He healed
3087,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,all that were brought to Him.
3088,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,
3089,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"But once on a Sabbath day, before the hour of sunset, a man came to Him"
3090,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"for help. The hand of this man was withered and helpless, and he came to"
3091,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,Christ hoping that He would heal it. We are told in the Bible that the
3092,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,Scribes and Pharisees watched Jesus to see whether He would heal on the
3093,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"Sabbath day, that they might find an accusation against Him for breaking"
3094,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"the commandment. But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to the man"
3095,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"which had the withered hand: ""Rise up and stand forth in the midst."" And"
3096,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"he arose and stood forth. Then said Jesus unto them: ""I will ask you one"
3097,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do evil; to save
3098,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"life or to destroy it?"" And looking round upon them all, He said unto"
3099,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"the man: ""Stretch forth thy hand!"" And he did so, and his hand was"
3100,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,restored whole as the other.
3101,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,
3102,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,Now our Saviour did not mean by performing this miracle to teach that
3103,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,the observance of the Sabbath should be lightly thought of. The teaching
3104,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,of our Lord and His example do not tend to lessen our reverence for this
3105,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,holy-day. But what He intended to show was that works of mercy are quite
3106,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"consistent with the holiness of the Sabbath, and that the Sabbath was"
3107,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,intended for the advantage and happiness of mankind.
3108,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,
3109,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,You would think that the gentle reproof of our Lord would have made
3110,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,these Scribes and Pharisees repent: but it was not so. They felt that
3111,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"they were put to shame before the people, and their rage and hatred"
3112,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,against our Saviour increased. They felt that they could not stand
3113,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"before His teaching, even had this teaching not been sustained as it was"
3114,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,"by such signs and wonders. They were losing influence, and if Christ was"

3116,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,
3117,THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.,Then the Pharisees and Scribes went and held council together against

3131,FRANK.,
3132,FRANK.,[Illustration: Decorative I]
3133,FRANK.,
3134,FRANK.,I think you would like to hear about a little friend of mine called
3135,FRANK.,"Frank. That is, he _was_ a little friend of mine, for he is grown into a"
3136,FRANK.,"man now; and though a friend still, he is by no means little, being"
3137,FRANK.,"above six feet high. However, what I am going to tell you of him"
3138,FRANK.,occurred years ago.
3139,FRANK.,
3140,FRANK.,"Frank's father died when he was quite young, and his mother, marrying"
3141,FRANK.,"again, went out to India; so it happened that he lived in London with"
3142,FRANK.,"his grandfather and grandmother. They, of course, were quite old people,"
3143,FRANK.,and he was always very glad to spend a part of his holidays with some
3144,FRANK.,"cousins at their house in the country, which was very near to where I"
3145,FRANK.,"lived. I was not quite grown up at that time, but I was so much older"
3146,FRANK.,"than Frank that he looked upon me as a very wise person, and one quite"
3147,FRANK.,fitted to give him advice.
3148,FRANK.,
3149,FRANK.,"Now Frank had a great talent for drawing, and I think that was what drew"
3150,FRANK.,"us together, for I had a turn that way also. He used to sketch the"
3151,FRANK.,"beautiful scenery in the neighbourhood; and, although he only sketched"
3152,FRANK.,"in pencil, he obtained good effects of distance, gave correctly the"
3153,FRANK.,"foliage of the different trees, and, above all, he seemed by natural"
3154,FRANK.,genius always to choose just the subjects which formed a nice
3155,FRANK.,composition as a picture.
3156,FRANK.,
3157,FRANK.,"He was at this time about twelve or thirteen years of age, and whenever"
3158,FRANK.,"he talked to me about his own future, which he very often did, I could"
3159,FRANK.,"not help encouraging him to become an artist. His grandfather, I knew,"
3160,FRANK.,"had other views, and intended him to be a merchant, there being some"
3161,FRANK.,advantageous opening for him in that way. Still I advised Frank at least
3162,FRANK.,"to let his grandfather know how much he wished to be an artist, and to"
3163,FRANK.,"show him some of his sketches; ""because,"" as I said, ""if he consents, it"
3164,FRANK.,"is time you should be put in the way of studying art properly."""
3165,FRANK.,
3166,FRANK.,"Well, Frank followed my advice. After spending his holidays in the"
3167,FRANK.,"country, he went to pass one day in town at his grandfather's before"
3168,FRANK.,"going to school. In the evening after dinner, when he was sitting with"
3169,FRANK.,"his grandfather and grandmother, he suddenly broke out with:--"
3170,FRANK.,
3171,FRANK.,"""Grandpapa dear, I want to be an artist."""
3172,FRANK.,
3173,FRANK.,"""An artist!"" said grandpapa; ""why, what fancy is this? I didn't know you"
3174,FRANK.,"had a taste that way. Here, let me see if you can draw this."""
3175,FRANK.,
3176,FRANK.,"He placed before his grandson a small ancient vase, which he took from a"
3177,FRANK.,"glass case; for Frank's grandfather, I must tell you, was a great"
3178,FRANK.,"collector of ancient things--relics, and curiosities."
3179,FRANK.,
3180,FRANK.,"Frank took his place at the opposite side of the table, and set to work."
3181,FRANK.,"At last he brought the paper round to grandpapa. There was the vase,"
3182,FRANK.,very fairly and correctly copied:--But I think I had better give you an
3183,FRANK.,"account of what happened in grandpapa's own words, as he told it all to"
3184,FRANK.,me some time afterwards.
3185,FRANK.,
3186,FRANK.,"""The vase was well drawn, no doubt,"" said grandpapa, ""but after all it"
3187,FRANK.,"was nothing extraordinary; and I was giving the paper back to Frank,"
3188,FRANK.,when I noticed that there was some drawing on the other side. Looking at
3189,FRANK.,"it again, I saw two heads--mere sketches, but better likenesses I never"
3190,FRANK.,saw. One was his grandmamma; there she was to the very life. The
3191,FRANK.,"other--well, the other was a caricature, rather than a portrait, of me."
3192,FRANK.,"I was made to appear ugly and ridiculous, instead of the good-looking"
3193,FRANK.,"old gentleman I am;"" (He said this laughing) ""still, it was a likeness,"
3194,FRANK.,"I confess. I tried to be angry, but laughed instead, and exclaimed: 'Ah,"
3195,FRANK.,"Frank, Frank! you shall be an artist if you like; you certainly have"
3196,FRANK.,"talent, but you must turn it to better account than by making"
3197,FRANK.,"caricatures of your old grandfather.'"""
3198,FRANK.,
3199,FRANK.,"Frank is now grown up, and has already obtained some fame as an artist."
3200,FRANK.,"I saw two pictures of his at the Royal Academy exhibition the other day,"
3201,FRANK.,which were admired and praised by everybody.

3251,DEER.,"Look at that fine stag in the picture, keeping guard while the does and"
3252,DEER.,"fawns are feeding! How watchful he looks, with his head erect; and how"
3253,DEER.,"grandly his antlers spread out, as we see them against the soft twilight"
3254,DEER.,"sky! Deer in their wild state are timid creatures; at least, they are"
3255,DEER.,very much afraid of human beings; and it is difficult to approach them.
3256,DEER.,Shooting the wild deer in the Highlands of Scotland is considered
3257,DEER.,excellent sport: it is called Deer-stalking. Large herds are to be found
3258,DEER.,"there among the mountains, but the greatest caution and skill are needed"
3259,DEER.,to get near enough to have a shot at them without being observed. Of
3260,DEER.,course the deer we see in parks are comparatively tame: they are
3261,DEER.,generally fallow deer; while those of the Highlands are a larger and
3262,DEER.,"stronger species, called red deer."
3263,DEER.,
3264,DEER.,I daresay many of you little people who read this have been to Richmond
3265,DEER.,"park, and seen the herds of graceful fallow deer there. If you go up"
3266,DEER.,very gently to them perhaps they will come and eat bread out of your
3267,DEER.,"hand. At least I remember when I was a little girl, and passed a summer"
3268,DEER.,"at Richmond, I succeeded once in making two young fawns come and share"
3269,DEER.,my biscuit with me. Shall I tell you how it happened?
3270,DEER.,
3271,DEER.,One morning I had not learnt my lessons as well as usual; perhaps I had
3272,DEER.,been watching the butterflies from the window flitting about in the
3273,DEER.,"sunshine instead of looking at my book; at any rate Miss Dobson, my"
3274,DEER.,"governess, thought it necessary to punish me. Now I was too big to be"
3275,DEER.,"put into the corner, being nine years old; and the mode of punishment"
3276,DEER.,"she always adopted was to avoid speaking to me for an hour or so, and at"
3277,DEER.,the same time to put on an expression of face at once severe and
3278,DEER.,sorrowful.
3279,DEER.,
3280,DEER.,"After school hours we went out for our walk in the park as usual, and,"
3281,DEER.,"as I was an affectionate and very talkative child, you may suppose that"
3282,DEER.,Miss Dobson's gloomy face and freezing silence made me very miserable.
3283,DEER.,"If I ventured upon a remark the answer never extended beyond ""yes"" or"
3284,DEER.,"""no""; sometimes not even that. We had two great dogs, which generally"
3285,DEER.,"went out with us on our walk; but when I was under punishment, even"
3286,DEER.,their companionship was not allowed.
3287,DEER.,
3288,DEER.,"At last Miss Dobson seated herself under a great oak, and began to read"
3289,DEER.,"a book she had brought out with her. Then I wandered a little way off,"
3290,DEER.,picking the pretty wild flowers that grew amongst the fern. The birds
3291,DEER.,"were singing in the sunshine, the bees were humming, everything with"
3292,DEER.,life seemed to enjoy that life but me. Some deer were lying under the
3293,DEER.,"shadow of the trees not far away, and I observed that two pretty little"
3294,DEER.,"fawns, standing nearer to me than the rest, were watching me. I had some"
3295,DEER.,"biscuit in my pocket, intended for the dogs; and taking a piece in my"
3296,DEER.,"hand, I walked up very softly to the little creatures. They looked at"
3297,DEER.,"me, as I approached, with a frightened glance from their great dark"
3298,DEER.,eyes; but I fancy there must have been a sad and subdued expression in
3299,DEER.,my childish face which took away from my appearance what might have
3300,DEER.,"terrified them, and on consideration they decided to remain."
3301,DEER.,
3302,DEER.,"Holding out the biscuit, I dropped it near them; then up jumped Mrs."
3303,DEER.,"Doe, and came forward to see what it was I offered to her children. I"
3304,DEER.,"threw her a piece also, which she took and munched gladly, and the"
3305,DEER.,little ones followed her example. I cannot describe to you what a
3306,DEER.,comfort it was to me in my trouble to find that these pretty creatures
3307,DEER.,"were not afraid of me, and did not shun me. I no longer felt solitary;"
3308,DEER.,no longer without friends or companions. Presently they took the biscuit
3309,DEER.,"from my fingers, and when I had no more to give them, they still thrust"
3310,DEER.,"their soft noses into my little hand, and let me stroke them."
3311,DEER.,
3312,DEER.,"But my pleasure did not last long. A fine stag, the leader of the herd,"
3313,DEER.,"who was lying in the midst of them, and who, I suppose, had been half"
3314,DEER.,"asleep, seemed suddenly to become conscious of my presence, and took"
3315,DEER.,"alarm. Jumping up, he bounded away, followed by the rest of the herd,"
3316,DEER.,and my two little friends went after the others.
3317,DEER.,
3318,DEER.,"Looking at them as they fled away from me, I felt more forlorn and"
3319,DEER.,"solitary than ever, and tears came into my eyes. Presently Miss Dobson"
3320,DEER.,"came up to me; she had been watching me from a distance, and now finding"
3321,DEER.,"that I was crying, her manner changed, and she was very kind. In fact,"
3322,DEER.,"my punishment was over for the time, and I think she began to find that"
3323,DEER.,it was a kind of punishment which I felt more than she intended.

3430,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3431,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,At the close of the last chapter I told you that an old gentleman had
3432,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"been looking on from a little distance, while Maurice and Adrienne were"
3433,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,discussing the sale of the horse. At last the old gentleman came up to
3434,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"Maurice, and said,--"
3435,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3436,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""Are you going to sell that little wooden horse, whose mechanism is so"
3437,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"ingenious?"""
3438,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3439,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""Yes, sir,"" replied Maurice, crying while he spoke."
3440,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3441,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""You seem very sorry to part with it. Tell me exactly why you sell it."""
3442,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3443,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"Maurice pointed to the poor family, sitting there against the railing of"
3444,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,the garden; and related all that had passed.
3445,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3446,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""You are a good boy,"" said the gentleman; ""listen now: I also wish to"
3447,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,help this poor woman. Will you let me join you in the good work? That
3448,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"will not make your merit the less."""
3449,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3450,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""Oh, I don't think about my own merit,"" said Maurice."
3451,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3452,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""You are right,"" replied the gentleman; ""charity does not think of self."
3453,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"I mean to say, if you would practise charity in a true and holy spirit,"
3454,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"you must forget yourself completely. You are too young, perhaps, to"
3455,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"understand all that; but if you remember my words, they will grow up in"
3456,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"your mind as a young tree grows in a good soil. Now, as to helping this"
3457,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"poor woman and her children: she wants two hundred francs, you say. I"
3458,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,will give her half that sum from myself; and I will lend you another
3459,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"hundred francs, that you may give them to her on your own part. Then"
3460,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"instead of selling your clever little horse to this young lady, you"
3461,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,shall leave it with me for a time as security for the repayment of the
3462,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"hundred francs. Your mamma gives you money sometimes, I daresay?"""
3463,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3464,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""Yes, sir."""
3465,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3466,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""Very well; put aside all the money she gives you till you have got"
3467,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,together a hundred francs. It won't take you long. You must do without
3468,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"sugar-plums, and cakes, and many a toy that you would otherwise buy. In"
3469,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,less than six months I have no doubt you will have the money. Let me
3470,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,see; this is the twelfth of February: we will fix the twelfth of August
3471,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,as the day when you will bring me the hundred francs and take back your
3472,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"horse."""
3473,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3474,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""But suppose I have not the money by that time?"" urged Maurice."
3475,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3476,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""Oh, you'll have it. All I fear is that your father or mother may give"
3477,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"it you on purpose to pay me, and not let you save it out of your usual"
3478,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"pocket-money. But I will see them or write to them about that. Remember,"
3479,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"my dear boy, that an action is only really noble when it requires"
3480,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"self-sacrifice of some sort."""
3481,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3482,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,My little readers may imagine with what eagerness Maurice accepted this
3483,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"proposition. Adrienne at first was very angry, and sulked and pouted for"
3484,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"a few minutes; then seeing some young friends come into the gardens, she"
3485,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"ran off to play with them, and seemed to forget the horse very soon."
3486,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3487,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"The gentleman tore out a leaf from his pocket-book, and wrote on it in"
3488,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,pencil a formal acknowledgment of his having received the wooden horse
3489,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,in pledge for a loan of one hundred francs; the horse to be restored
3490,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,within six months on repayment of the money. He signed his name to the
3491,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"paper, and handed it to Maurice."

3493,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"[Illustration: HE WENT AWAY, LEADING CRESSIDA BY THE BRIDLE.]"
3494,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3495,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"On reading it, Maurice was surprised to see the name of Duberger. He"
3496,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,recognised it as the name of one of the most distinguished members of
3497,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,the Academy of sciences; a name of European celebrity. The little boy
3498,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,looked up at his new friend with an expression of curiosity and
3499,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"admiration, at which the latter seemed both amused and pleased."
3500,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3501,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,Mr. Duberger at that time was not really old--at least not old for a
3502,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,philosopher and man of science. He looked old because his long hair was
3503,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"grey, his figure was stooping, and his dress neglected. But, for all"
3504,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"that, his appearance was calculated to inspire respect and sympathy,"
3505,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,while his face wore an expression at once of goodness and intelligence.
3506,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"He embraced Maurice, bidding him tell his father and mother all that had"
3507,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"happened; he went away leading Cressida by the bridle, and leaving"
3508,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,Maurice to give the two hundred francs to the poor woman himself.
3509,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3510,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"Thus at last Maurice and his horse were parted, though after all he was"
3511,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,not breaking his promise to Fritz. He had resisted the temptation of
3512,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"exchanging Cressida for Eusèbe's pretty goat--the gentle, graceful"
3513,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"Jeanne. He had resisted persuasions, entreaties, and the offer of many a"
3514,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"beautiful toy. Even when his uncle, by way of trying him, pretended that"
3515,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,he wished to have the little mechanical horse to amuse him on board
3516,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"ship, Maurice had remembered, and still kept, his promise. Now, he"
3517,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,parted with Cressida for the sake of helping a poor family in distress;
3518,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,and Fritz had expressly said that for such an object only Maurice might
3519,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"sell the horse. Besides, was he not to have the horse again in six"
3520,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,months?
3521,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3522,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"When he presented the money to the poor woman, she showed some confusion"
3523,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,at receiving so large a sum from the hands of a child. Maurice explained
3524,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"to the little girl, who acted as interpreter, that he was not their only"
3525,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,benefactor.
3526,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3527,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""Duberger! Maurice de Roisel!"" the poor little girl repeated several"
3528,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"times; then continued, ""I will teach my brothers to say those two names;"
3529,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,we will never forget them; they will be as dear to us as the names of
3530,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,our own father and mother. Our name is Kirchner: our father is Leopold
3531,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"Kirchner, formerly of Nuremburg, where he was a blacksmith well known"
3532,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"throughout the city for his skill. Now he is rich, and a proprietor of"
3533,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"land in the United States of America, a country beyond the seas a long"
3534,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"way from here."""
3535,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3536,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"The mother took Maurice's two hands in hers, and said some words in"
3537,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,German.
3538,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3539,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""My mother says,"" explained the little daughter, ""that you are born with"
3540,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"divine charity in your heart, and she prays God to lead you by the hand"
3541,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"through your life, on the path that leads to heaven. She prays, besides,"
3542,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"that happiness may fall on you and all who are dear to you."""
3543,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3544,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""Pray, above all,"" replied my little friend, deeply touched, ""that my"
3545,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"dear father may be restored to health."""
3546,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3547,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,With these words he took leave of the poor family to whom he had proved
3548,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"such a benefactor, and hastened home, anxious to learn how his father"
3549,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,was going on.
3550,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3551,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""My father!--how is he?"" he asked of the servant, as the door was"
3552,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,opened.
3553,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3554,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""My master has been asking for you, sir,"" replied the servant; then,"
3555,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"seeing the tears in Maurice's eyes, he added: ""but you must not let him"
3556,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"see you cry, or he will think he is worse than he really is."""
3557,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3558,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""The tears come to my eyes in spite of me,"" replied my little friend,"
3559,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,drying his eyes and checking his tears as well as he could.
3560,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3561,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"Maurice went into his father's room, which appeared almost dark to him."
3562,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,The poor invalid's eyes were weak and could not support the light.
3563,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"Maurice, impressed by the silence and darkness of the room, walked as"
3564,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"quietly as possible on tiptoe up to his mother, whom he could"
3565,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,distinguish sitting by the side of the bed. She was praying silently to
3566,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"herself, but on seeing her little boy, she took him in her arms, and"
3567,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"leant with him over his father's bed, who pressed him to his heart."
3568,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3569,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""My child, my dear child!"""
3570,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3571,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"Maurice could restrain his tears no longer, and his father observed it."
3572,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3573,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""Why do you cry, my darling boy?"" said he; ""you think me very ill? But"
3574,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"don't be alarmed; God is all powerful, and may save me yet. Take"
3575,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"courage; it will all pass away. I shall be cured before long; and, when"
3576,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"the weather gets fine, I will take walks in the Luxembourg gardens with"
3577,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"you and Cressida. Do not cry like that, my child, you will make yourself"
3578,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"ill."""
3579,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3580,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"My little friend's emotion was uncontrollable, and he was led out of the"
3581,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"room by his mother, while the poor father sank back upon his pillow"
3582,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,exhausted with the few words he had spoken.
3583,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3584,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"The next morning, when Jacques came into Maurice's room to wake him, the"
3585,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,first words spoken by the little boy were to inquire after his father.
3586,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"Jacques replied that the doctor, who had been there late the evening"
3587,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"before, had declared that his patient was better, and had told Mrs. de"
3588,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,Roisel that he had great hope now of his recovery. Maurice felt happier
3589,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,than he had done since he was present at the consultation of the doctors
3590,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"the morning before. Then, as he looked round the room, he saw Cressida's"
3591,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"empty stable, and occupied as his thoughts were by his father, he still"
3592,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,felt inclined to shed a tear at the sight.
3593,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3594,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"""Do you know, Jacques,"" he said, ""I had a dream about Fritz in the"
3595,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"night. I thought that I saw him, and I was afraid he would ask me what I"
3596,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"had done with Cressida; but instead of that, he took me in his arms, and"
3597,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"embraced me, and called me his dear good boy."""
3598,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3599,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,The hope expressed by the doctor that Mr. de Roisel would yet recover
3600,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"proved to be well founded, and when the month of April came on he had"
3601,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"regained his strength sufficiently to bear a journey to Nice, so as to"
3602,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,escape the sudden changes of temperature to which Paris is subject in
3603,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"the spring. He made the journey, accompanied by his wife and son."
3604,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"Arriving at Nice, they took a pretty villa, having a view of the sea on"
3605,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"one side, and, on the other, delicious garden, in which my little friend"
3606,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"was surprised to find rose-trees, lilacs, and other plants in full"
3607,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"bloom, which at Paris had scarcely begun to bud."

3609,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,[Illustration: THEY HEARD A GREAT NOISE OF CRACKING OF WHIPS.]
3610,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3611,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,The climate of Nice agreed with Mr. de Roisel so well that they stayed
3612,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"there nearly four months, and it was already the beginning of August"
3613,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,when the family returned once more to their own home--the pretty
3614,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,comfortable old house where I first introduced Maurice to my little
3615,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,readers. Maurice was heartily glad to be back again at his own
3616,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"country-home, where he had his own little garden, where he knew"
3617,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"everybody in the village, and where even the trees in the wood, and the"
3618,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"little winding river with its pretty water-lilies, seemed like old"
3619,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,friends to him.
3620,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3621,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"The very first day of his arrival at home, the little boy ran off to the"
3622,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"cottage of Fritz, to see if he had returned. He found it shut up, and no"
3623,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,one in the village had heard anything about him since his departure.
3624,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"Although Maurice felt rather anxious at Fritz's prolonged absence, it"
3625,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,yet afforded him a sort of satisfaction; for he would have been sorry
3626,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"that Fritz, on their first meeting, should find him without the horse. A"
3627,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"few days more, and he hoped to be in possession of it again."
3628,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3629,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"In fact he had already collected together, out of the savings of his"
3630,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"pocket-money, the sum of a hundred francs; and the day after their"
3631,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"arrival at home, his father wrote to Mr. Duberger to say that he should"
3632,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"have the pleasure of bringing his little boy, on the twelfth of the"
3633,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"month, to pay him a visit and to redeem the horse."
3634,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3635,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"On the morning of the twelfth, my little friend and his father were just"
3636,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"preparing to start, when they heard a sound of carriage wheels and"
3637,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"horses' hoofs, accompanied by a great noise of cracking of whips, on the"
3638,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,drive leading to the house. A minute afterwards a carriage with four
3639,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,horses and postillions drew up at the door.

3641,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,From this carriage descended Eusèbe and his father. They were not
3642,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"expected, and never were visitors less wished for. Mr. de Malassise"
3643,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"began by making their excuses for arriving so unexpectedly, and"
3644,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,explained the reason. He said that Eusèbe had heard only the day before
3645,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"of Maurice's return, and a violent fancy had seized him suddenly to come"
3646,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,and pay a visit to his cousin. It had been impossible to persuade Eusèbe
3647,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,to delay the visit till they could write and give notice of their
3648,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"intention. Eusèbe, he said, had insisted upon starting early that"
3649,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"morning; and had he been thwarted, that terrible attack of nervous"
3650,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"fever, so much dreaded by his parents, might have come on at last. So"
3651,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"they had made the journey with post-horses, and there they were!"
3652,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,
3653,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,It was a sad disappointment to Maurice that his visit to Mr. Duberger
3654,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,"should be put off, but there was no alternative; and after all it was"
3655,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,only a delay of perhaps a couple of days. Cressida could remain without
3656,NICE.--RETURN HOME.--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.,inconvenience for another forty-eight hours at Mr. Duberger's.

3748,THE CHILD AMONG THE WOLF-CUBS.,"Now, one day she sat with her little child in the forest, and gave the"

3751,THE CHILD AMONG THE WOLF-CUBS.,"were wicked wolves, and when the sheep went further away under the"

3754,THE CHILD AMONG THE WOLF-CUBS.,"bade her eat it; saying, ""Be sure not fill the spoon too full,"" and off"

3757,THE CHILD AMONG THE WOLF-CUBS.,"And as the child sat alone, and ate and ate, there came a big she-wolf"

3760,THE CHILD AMONG THE WOLF-CUBS.,"the mother came back the child was gone; the bowl was there, but the"

3832,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,
3833,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,In our last Sunday talk I told you how our Saviour healed the man with
3834,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,the withered hand: and how angry the Pharisees were at His doing so on
3835,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"the Sabbath. You understand, my children, that Christ was not teaching"
3836,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"us to regard the Sabbath with less reverence, but He showed us by His"
3837,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,example that works of mercy and kindness are consistent with the
3838,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"holiness of Sunday. Christ said, ""It is lawful to do well on the Sabbath"
3839,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"day."" To attend the sick, comfort the afflicted, teach the young and"
3840,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"ignorant,--these are all good works; and to do these is ""to do well."""
3841,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,
3842,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"The Pharisees and Scribes were always on the watch for something, either"
3843,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"in the doctrines that Christ taught, or in His acts, which might serve"
3844,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,as a ground for arresting Him and bringing Him to trial. But besides the
3845,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"open enmity of these men, our Saviour had a difficulty to contend with"
3846,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,in the want of thorough and perfect faith even in those who dearly loved
3847,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,Him--His own disciples; and some of the miracles He performed had for
3848,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,their object chiefly to confirm and strengthen the faith of His
3849,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,followers. The miracle I am going to tell you of--the stilling of the
3850,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"tempest--was one of these, and was witnessed only by the disciples who"
3851,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,were with Him in the ship.
3852,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,
3853,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,Not only was faith necessary for the disciples in order to give them
3854,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,confidence in the protection of God while they helped our Saviour in His
3855,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"work, or when they should have to continue it after Him, but perfect"
3856,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,faith was needed before they could acquire the power of performing
3857,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"miracles. On one occasion, when some of them had attempted the"
3858,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"miraculous cure of a boy, and failed, they asked Christ the reason of"
3859,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"their failure. He replied: ""Because of your unbelief. If ye have faith"
3860,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove"
3861,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"hence to yonder place; and it shall remove, and nothing shall be"
3862,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"impossible to you."""
3863,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,
3864,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"The apostles--that is, the chosen few, who continued the mission of our"
3865,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,Saviour after His crucifixion--had the power of working miracles
3866,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,conferred upon them. We may assume therefore that their faith was
3867,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,perfect. But let us come to the miracle I have to tell you of today.
3868,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,
3869,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,Our Saviour had been teaching the people all day from a boat on the lake
3870,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"of Galilee; the people being ranged along the shore, so that they could"
3871,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"all hear without crowding in upon Him. When evening came on, He desired"
3872,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"the people to return to their homes, and bade His disciples put their"
3873,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"boat from the land, and depart to the other side of the lake. As they"
3874,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"left the shore, the water was smooth and calm, and the cool air blew"
3875,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"gently from the mountains. Christ, tired out with the exertion of the"
3876,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"day, lay down to rest and fell asleep."
3877,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,
3878,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"The boat bore them over the rippling waves, and the disciples conversed"
3879,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,most likely about the teaching of our Saviour which they had heard that
3880,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,day. They thought very probably that their faith in Him was quite
3881,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,strong: but it was soon to be tried. A terrible storm arose suddenly;
3882,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"the wind blew furiously; the great waves arose around the little vessel,"
3883,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"and broke over its sides; the sail was torn, the mast broken. Then the"
3884,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"disciples, in terror, rushed to our Saviour to wake Him, saying, ""Lord,"
3885,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"save us! we perish."""
3886,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,
3887,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"Christ said unto them: ""Why are ye fearful? oh, ye of little faith!"" and"
3888,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"He rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm."
3889,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,
3890,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,But even after this the disciples did not seem thoroughly to understand
3891,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"our Saviour; for the scripture tells us that ""they marvelled, saying,"
3892,STILLING THE TEMPEST.,"What manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"""

3911,LENA.,and the daughter of a fisherman; nevertheless she is one of my dearest
3912,LENA.,"little friends. She lives in a cottage on the banks of the river Rhine,"
3913,LENA.,a short distance from the city of Coblenz. Her father earns his living
3914,LENA.,as a boatman and fisherman upon the river; her mother takes care of the
3915,LENA.,"cottage, of their only child, and of the poultry: she finds plenty of"
3916,LENA.,time for making lace besides. I will tell you how I came to make little
3917,LENA.,Lena's acquaintance.
3918,LENA.,
3919,LENA.,"I passed one summer not long ago at Coblenz, at a villa on the banks of"
3920,LENA.,"the river just outside the city. One evening, after a very hot day, I"
3921,LENA.,wandered a little way along the road by the side of the great beautiful
3922,LENA.,"river. I watched the lights gradually appearing, like fireflies in the"
3923,LENA.,"distance, in the windows of the old castle or fortress of"
3924,LENA.,"Ehrenbreitstein, which crowns a rocky hill on the opposite bank; and I"
3925,LENA.,"watched, too, the lights and shadows borne on the breast of the swift"
3926,LENA.,"river beneath. I stood looking at the restless ever-flowing water,"
3927,LENA.,"comparing the river in its course to my own life, or to the lives of"
3928,LENA.,"others; and thinking many thoughts which you, my little readers, would"
3929,LENA.,hardly understand.
3930,LENA.,
3931,LENA.,At length my meditations were disturbed by a woman who came out of a
3932,LENA.,"cottage close by, and who, walking to the edge of the bank, there sat"
3933,LENA.,"down, threw her apron over her head, and began to cry bitterly. It"
3934,LENA.,seemed as if she had come out of the cottage on purpose to have a good
3935,LENA.,"cry without disturbing some one within. After a moment's hesitation, I"
3936,LENA.,went up and begged her to tell me what was the matter. She replied that
3937,LENA.,"her little girl was very ill with low fever, and the doctor had told her"
3938,LENA.,that very evening that he had scarcely any hope.
3939,LENA.,
3940,LENA.,"This woman was Lena's mother. I asked her to let me see the child, whom"
3941,LENA.,"I found flushed and restless, tossing from side to side in her bed. Poor"
3942,LENA.,"little Lena! The cottage was near my own house, and I went every day"
3943,LENA.,after that to see her. Often did I watch part of the night by her sick
3944,LENA.,bed while her mother rested. At length our little patient began to
3945,LENA.,"recover; and while she was still too weak to walk, she delighted to sit"
3946,LENA.,"at the cottage door, and listen while I told her stories."
3947,LENA.,
3948,LENA.,"Now, besides the poultry about the cottage, Lena had a pair of white"
3949,LENA.,"doves, and in one of my stories I had told her of a letter being sent by"
3950,LENA.,a carrier-pigeon. Lena took it into her head that one of her white doves
3951,LENA.,should carry letters from her to me after I returned to England. One
3952,LENA.,"day, when she was almost well, I found her standing at the door of the"
3953,LENA.,"cottage, with the dove perched upon her hand, and a letter tied round"
3954,LENA.,its neck. She had been trying if it would carry a letter to me to my
3955,LENA.,house close by; but it had only wheeled round and round and come back
3956,LENA.,"again to her. She said sadly: ""If it does not know how to take a letter"
3957,LENA.,"that little distance, how will it ever take one to England?"""
3958,LENA.,
3959,LENA.,Dear simple Lena! she did not understand that pigeons will only return
3960,LENA.,to places where they have lived; but we have managed to correspond
3961,LENA.,without the help of carrier-pigeons. I have seldom seen a prettier
3962,LENA.,"picture than she presented that day, standing at the cottage door with"
3963,LENA.,the white dove upon her hand.

4004,WOODPECKERS.,
4005,WOODPECKERS.,Here we have a picture of Woodpeckers. See how they cling to the bark of
4006,WOODPECKERS.,"the tree with their claws, and how eager the two little ones seem for"
4007,WOODPECKERS.,the prize their mother has just captured. The woodpecker is a bird of
4008,WOODPECKERS.,very singular habits. It lives upon the insects which exist in the bark
4009,WOODPECKERS.,"of trees, and is remarkably adapted by nature for obtaining this kind of"
4010,WOODPECKERS.,food. Its bill is long and sharp and powerful; and with its hooked claws
4011,WOODPECKERS.,it clings to the tree while it sways its body to and fro to give force
4012,WOODPECKERS.,to the strokes of its bill. The object of these strokes is to shake the
4013,WOODPECKERS.,"insects out of the tree, and they are given with wonderful force and in"
4014,WOODPECKERS.,rapid succession. Then the bird thrusts its long tongue into the
4015,WOODPECKERS.,"crevices, and the tongue being barbed at the end and covered with a sort"
4016,WOODPECKERS.,"of gum, it secures a vast number of insects as well as their eggs."
4017,WOODPECKERS.,
4018,WOODPECKERS.,In the quiet of the woods the sound of the woodpecker tapping may be
4019,WOODPECKERS.,"heard at a great distance. I remember once, when I was a little girl,"
4020,WOODPECKERS.,being very much frightened by the noise: I will tell you how it
4021,WOODPECKERS.,happened.
4022,WOODPECKERS.,
4023,WOODPECKERS.,"The house where I lived in the country not only had a large garden, but"
4024,WOODPECKERS.,"beyond that was a little wood, which we called the shrubbery. This wood"
4025,WOODPECKERS.,"had a broad walk winding through it, with seats placed here and there."
4026,WOODPECKERS.,"One beautiful summer morning I and my brother, who was some years older"
4027,WOODPECKERS.,"than I was, were sitting together upon one of these seats under the"
4028,WOODPECKERS.,"shade of the trees. He was on his way to go out fishing, and was only"
4029,WOODPECKERS.,stopping to do something to his fishing tackle. Wanting a pair of
4030,WOODPECKERS.,"scissors, he sent me into the house to fetch them, ordering me about in"
4031,WOODPECKERS.,the sort of way in which big boys are apt to order their little brothers
4032,WOODPECKERS.,and sisters.
4033,WOODPECKERS.,
4034,WOODPECKERS.,"I soon returned with the scissors, but no longer found my brother where"
4035,WOODPECKERS.,I had left him. The truth is he had gone off on his fishing expedition
4036,WOODPECKERS.,"without waiting for my return. However, I looked about for him, and"
4037,WOODPECKERS.,presently I heard a sound like somebody hitting a tree with a stick.
4038,WOODPECKERS.,"""Ah, ah, so you are hiding, are you, Master Maurice?"" thought I; and I"
4039,WOODPECKERS.,"looked behind different trees, one after another, thinking every moment"
4040,WOODPECKERS.,"to discover him. Then I began to fancy that the sound, although so clear"
4041,WOODPECKERS.,"and distinct, was some distance off; so I wandered on, still following"
4042,WOODPECKERS.,"it, and looking about as I went. Now and then the tapping ceased, but"
4043,WOODPECKERS.,always went on again after a minute.
4044,WOODPECKERS.,
4045,WOODPECKERS.,"At last I began to be frightened, and called out:--""Maurice, dear"
4046,WOODPECKERS.,"Maurice, where are you? You are frightening me."" The tapping ceased from"
4047,WOODPECKERS.,"that moment, but my alarm did not. That such a noise should have been"
4048,WOODPECKERS.,made without anybody to make it seemed to me very like something
4049,WOODPECKERS.,"supernatural. I began to cry, and at the same time set off running"
4050,WOODPECKERS.,"towards home. I dared not look behind me as I ran, and when I reached"
4051,WOODPECKERS.,"the house, was at first too frightened and excited even to explain what"
4052,WOODPECKERS.,was the matter. I must tell you that I was only seven years old at that
4053,WOODPECKERS.,time.
4054,WOODPECKERS.,
4055,WOODPECKERS.,"I remember the old gardener said, when he heard the story, that he"
4056,WOODPECKERS.,suspected that it was only a woodpecker tapping; but I refused to
4057,WOODPECKERS.,believe that a bird could make so loud a noise. It was not till long
4058,WOODPECKERS.,"afterwards, when I happened to both hear and see one, that I became"
4059,WOODPECKERS.,convinced the old gardener was right.
4060,WOODPECKERS.,
4061,WOODPECKERS.,"The woodpecker is a handsome bird, about the size of a pigeon, of a"
4062,WOODPECKERS.,"greenish colour, with black and white marks upon the wings, and a"
4063,WOODPECKERS.,"crimson stain upon the head. It is heard much oftener than seen, for,"
4064,WOODPECKERS.,"being very timid, it is ingenious in hiding itself. It does not build a"
4065,WOODPECKERS.,"nest like other birds, but seeks for a decayed place in the trunk of"
4066,WOODPECKERS.,"some tree, where it scoops out a hole. There Mr. and Mrs. Woodpecker"
4067,WOODPECKERS.,"establish their little home: there the eggs are laid, and the young ones"
4068,WOODPECKERS.,are reared.

4091,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4092,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,The visit of Mr. de Malassise and Eusèbe only lasted two days. Eusèbe
4093,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"went away very well satisfied with himself, for in those two days he had"
4094,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,contrived to alarm his father several times by putting himself in a
4095,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"passion, and had teazed his cousin so ingeniously that he more than once"
4096,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,brought tears into his eyes.
4097,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4098,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"The morning after the departure of these unwelcome visitors, Mr. de"
4099,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"Roisel and Maurice started off on their expedition to see Mr. Duberger,"
4100,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,and to bring back the horse. They were going two days later than was
4101,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"intended, but a letter had been already sent to Mr. Duberger, explaining"
4102,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,why they were obliged to postpone their visit from the twelfth of August
4103,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"to the fourteenth. That gentleman did not live habitually at Paris, but"
4104,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"at a place called Palaiseau, which was not more than two or three hours'"
4105,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,drive from Maurice's home. Mr. de Roisel drove Maurice in a light chaise
4106,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"with one horse; and they started very early, in order to avoid the heat"
4107,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,of the day.
4108,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4109,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,Palaiseau is a large straggling village situated in a pleasant valley;
4110,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"and on the hills around are many pretty country houses, one of which was"
4111,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,inhabited by Mr. Duberger. Neither Maurice nor his father had been there
4112,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"before, so, on arriving in the village, they had to inquire which was"
4113,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,the house. Just in front of the little inn of the village stood three or
4114,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"four men, conversing earnestly, and Mr. de Roisel inquired of them for"
4115,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,the house he wanted. One of them replied:--
4116,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4117,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""It is a good half mile beyond the village, sir; and stands quite alone"
4118,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,on the right hand side of the road. We were just talking about a report
4119,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"there is in the village this morning, that Mr. Duberger's house was"
4120,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,broken into by thieves last night; but the accounts are so different I
4121,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"hardly know if any of them are true."""
4122,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4123,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"Mr. de Roisel touched his horse with the whip and hastened on, feeling"
4124,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,very anxious and alarmed. After driving about half a mile along the
4125,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"road, he pulled up again to ask his way of a woman who was standing at"
4126,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,the door of a cottage.
4127,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4128,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Do you want to see Mr. Duberger?"" exclaimed the good woman. ""Ah, poor"
4129,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,dear man! Only to think there are wretches in the world who would do him
4130,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"an injury! But they do not belong to these parts, I'm certain. He does"
4131,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"so much good, that no one here would hurt a hair of his head."""
4132,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4133,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Good heavens! Has he been murdered?"""
4134,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4135,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Murdered! No, no: but he was robbed last night of a great many valuable"
4136,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"things. That's bad enough, I hope. If you want to see him, sir, that's"
4137,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"his house, yonder among the trees. The turning there on the right leads"
4138,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"directly up to it."" Saying this she pointed to a house, which, seen from"
4139,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"a distance, had a good appearance."
4140,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4141,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"They turned up what might once have been a handsome avenue of trees, but"
4142,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"many had died or been cut down, and never been replaced. A number of"
4143,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"sheep were grazing beneath the trees of the avenue, and there reigned"
4144,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,over the place that air of quiet and peace which brings repose both to

4148,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4149,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"Reaching the iron gate of the courtyard, Mr. de Roisel got down to ring"
4150,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"the bell, but finding that the gate was not fastened he opened it, and"
4151,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,the chaise drew up at the stone steps of the entrance door. The house
4152,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"appeared large, but very much out of repair. The walls were crumbling in"
4153,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"parts, and broken shutters hung at the windows; but this appearance of"
4154,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,decay or disorder seemed rather the effect of negligence than of
4155,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,poverty.
4156,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4157,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"They soon heard the sound of slow footsteps approaching from the inside,"
4158,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"and an old woman, having the look of a housekeeper, appeared at the"
4159,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"door. Glancing at our travellers, she turned back into the house, and"
4160,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"they could hear her call out to some one within:--""It's the gentleman"
4161,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,who wrote to you the day before yesterday. I was sure you would not be
4162,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"ready to receive him."""
4163,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4164,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Well, well, Marianne,"" replied a man's voice, ""I'm making all the haste"
4165,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"I can."""
4166,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4167,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Sir,"" said the old woman, coming forward again, and addressing Mr. de"
4168,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"Roisel, making at the same time a curtsey after the manner of a peasant,"
4169,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""you are welcome. If you will trouble yourself to walk into the"
4170,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"drawing-room, my master will join you there in an instant. Michel will"
4171,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"take the horse to the stable, sir. See, he's coming as quickly as he"
4172,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,can. He doesn't run very fast; his legs are like mine--a little stiff.
4173,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"In truth, he's no longer young. He has been our gardener, sir, for more"
4174,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"than fifty years."""
4175,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4176,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"Michel was a little withered old man, bent from age, and from the habit"
4177,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,of stooping at his work.
4178,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4179,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Sir,"" said he, in a shaking voice, ""excuse my slowness; I have no"
4180,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"longer the activity of a youth. Besides, I had a good walk this morning"
4181,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"to go after the police."""
4182,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4183,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""It is true then, this robbery I have heard of? What has been stolen?"
4184,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"Any money?"""
4185,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4186,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""No, unfortunately,"" replied the old woman; ""if it were only money my"
4187,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"master would not care so much. He thinks little about money--not enough,"
4188,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,indeed. But the thieves have carried away some precious and curious
4189,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,things that never can be replaced. Still we ought to thank Providence
4190,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,that we all remained fast asleep while the robbers were in the house. If
4191,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"we had wakened up, perhaps they would have cut our throats. But come in,"
4192,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"I beg, sir."""
4193,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4194,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"As they entered the room, Marianne went on:--""It must be confessed that"
4195,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,my master himself is partly to blame for what has happened. He never
4196,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,would have the doors fastened or the windows barred up. He trusts
4197,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"everybody. But won't you sit down, sir?"" (Here she put forward some"
4198,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"chairs) ""You see we might all have been murdered, sir. That would have"
4199,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,mattered very little for Michel and me; we are so old; but for him!--I
4200,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"tremble to think of it."""
4201,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4202,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"While the old woman chattered away, Mr. de Roisel looked round the room,"
4203,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,but he saw nothing there to justify the character which Mr. Duberger
4204,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"bore of being an enlightened collector of curiosities and works of art,"
4205,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"as well as a man of science. The furniture was extremely old, and of the"
4206,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,fashion of fifty years ago. Some badly executed drawings hung on the
4207,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,walls; and an old-fashioned clock stood on the mantelpiece.
4208,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4209,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""What!"" said Mr. de Roisel, observing it, ""can it be past eleven?"""
4210,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4211,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Oh, no, sir,"" replied Marianne; ""pardon me, it is not yet ten. That"
4212,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"clock is an excellent one, only if you do not understand its ways, it is"
4213,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,apt to mislead. The thieves did not take anything from this room last
4214,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,night: they seemed to know where the valuable things were to be found.
4215,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"The furniture of this room, sir, my master sometimes says would not sell"
4216,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,for fifty francs altogether: still it is of value to him--and to me
4217,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"also,--for it belonged to his grandmother, my first mistress. This old"
4218,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,furniture is associated with the recollection of one we loved. These
4219,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"drawings were made by her, and her husband had them framed as you see."
4220,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"My master adored his grandmother, and these old things are precious to"
4221,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"him for her sake."""
4222,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4223,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,Mr. de Roisel felt a strong sympathy for the man who united such
4224,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,tenderness of heart with the rare intellect which had made him
4225,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"celebrated. Maurice also was touched, and took the withered hand of"
4226,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,Marianne in his own.
4227,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4228,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""You are very good, my little gentleman; you remind me of my master in"
4229,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"his childhood."" Then she went on: ""After the death of my first mistress,"
4230,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,I served the mother of Mr. Duberger. She died too young to see the
4231,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"success and honours of her son: I have never quitted my master since."""
4232,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4233,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,At this moment Mr. Duberger entered.
4234,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4235,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Leave us now, my good Marianne,"" said he. Then embracing Maurice, he"
4236,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"exclaimed: ""Why, how you have grown! I think the good God watches over"
4237,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,children that have kind hearts. You have been growing up in happiness
4238,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"and health, as a flower blossoms in the spring-time."" Then turning to"
4239,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"Mr. de Roisel, he added: ""I received your letter, sir, and regret very"
4240,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"much indeed that the day of your coming was postponed."""
4241,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4242,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""I fear we have come at a very inconvenient time."""
4243,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4244,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Oh, it is not that; but you are one day too late."" Then taking Maurice"
4245,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"on his knee, he went on: ""You are a brave boy, and no doubt have"
4246,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,deprived yourself of a good deal in collecting these hundred francs; but
4247,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"they are useless after all. When we met in the Luxembourg gardens, I"
4248,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,thought it better for you that your charity to the poor woman should
4249,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,cost you some real sacrifice; but I was wrong to take your horse in
4250,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"pledge for the money. Now I am your debtor, and a debtor who cannot"
4251,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"pay."""
4252,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4253,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""I understand,"" said Maurice, as he burst into tears; ""the thieves"
4254,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"carried off Cressida last night. But it is not your fault."""
4255,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4256,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Yes, yes, it is my fault. I was wanting in prudence; I kept neither"

4258,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4259,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Not so, indeed, sir,"" said Mr. de Roisel; ""it has been a chance which"
4260,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,nobody could foresee. But do you not think the thieves may yet be
4261,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"discovered?"""
4262,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4263,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Probably. I think they will betray themselves in trying to sell the"

4265,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4266,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"""Let us hope so,"" rejoined Mr. de Roisel."
4267,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,
4268,A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.--THE HORSE IS STOLEN.,"With this hope, and the chance it afforded of the recovery of the horse,"

4529,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"raising of the daughter of Jairus,"" which means--restoring her to life."
4530,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,
4531,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,Our Saviour was one day at the house of His disciple Matthew at
4532,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"Capernaum, when a man of importance in the city, a ruler in the"
4533,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"synagogue, named Jairus, came to Him. This man had an only child, a"
4534,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"daughter about twelve years old, who was lying at the point of death;"
4535,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,and he came to Jesus in the hope that He would cure her.
4536,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,
4537,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"Generally, the poor and lowly were the first to believe in our Saviour."
4538,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,The rich were slow to accept the self-denying doctrines which He taught;
4539,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,the learned were too wise in their own esteem to listen to His
4540,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,instruction. But when they were in affliction both the rich and the
4541,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,learned sometimes came to Jesus to seek His aid. So it was in this
4542,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,instance.
4543,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,
4544,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,We may imagine what the unhappy father suffered at the prospect of
4545,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"losing his darling child,--at the thought of her fading away from him,"
4546,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"and sinking into the grave. As he was rich, we may suppose that all had"
4547,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,been done by the doctors that could be done; so now in an agony of
4548,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,despair he turned to seek our Saviour. No doubt he thought of all the
4549,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"miraculous cures Jesus had effected, as he went towards Matthew's house,"
4550,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,where he found our Saviour at the door teaching a crowd of people.
4551,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"Jairus immediately fell at His feet, and with heart-felt earnestness"
4552,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"""besought him greatly"" that He would come and see his child."
4553,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,
4554,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"Jesus rose, and went forth, followed by a number of people, while Jairus"
4555,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"led the way to his own house. The poor father would have walked quickly,"
4556,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"every moment seeming an age till he reached his sick child's bedside,"
4557,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"but the crowd pressing round, interfered with their speed, and soon"
4558,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,there arose another cause of delay.
4559,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,
4560,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,In the crowd was a poor woman who had been very ill for a long time. She
4561,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"had consulted many doctors, but none could cure her; and at last she had"
4562,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,spent all her money in trying to regain her health. Hearing that Jesus
4563,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"was near, she approached Him in great fear and trembling. She was almost"
4564,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"crushed by the crowd, as she struggled to come near Him; but at length"
4565,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"succeeded so far as to be able to stretch forth her hand, and touch the"
4566,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,border of His mantle. In a moment she felt that she was recovering from
4567,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"her illness. Our Saviour stopped, and turned towards her, when she cast"
4568,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"herself at His feet, fearing for her presumption. But He looked"
4569,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"graciously upon her, for He knew why she had touched His garment; then"
4570,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"speaking to her, He said:--""Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath"
4571,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"made thee whole."" And from that hour she was cured."
4572,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,
4573,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"After this incident, Jairus was again hurrying on, leading the way to"
4574,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"his house, when messengers met him with the agonizing intelligence that"
4575,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,the child was already dead--gone beyond the reach of human help.
4576,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"Thereupon Christ turned to Jairus, saying:--""Be not afraid; only"
4577,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"believe, and she shall be made whole."" For it was as easy to Him to"
4578,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"bring back the dead, as to restore the living."
4579,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,
4580,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,He went into the house with three of His disciples and the parents of
4581,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"the child. Then He addressed words of comfort to the father and mother,"
4582,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"saying,--""The damsel is not dead but sleepeth;""--meaning that her death"
4583,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"would only be like a short sleep, because He was going to bring her back"
4584,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,to life.
4585,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,
4586,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"Then taking hold of the little girl's hand, as though He were about to"
4587,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"waken her from a pleasant sleep, He said: ""Talitha cumi!""--that is,"
4588,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"""Damsel, arise!"" The words were no sooner spoken, than the colour"
4589,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"returned to her cheeks, her eyes opened, and she arose as if just"
4590,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,awakened from a refreshing sleep.
4591,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,
4592,RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.,"We are told that ""the parents and all present were astonished with a"

4628,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"people. He thought Elfie understood everything that was said to him, and"
4629,ALEC AND ELFIE.,could do almost everything he was told to do. Many an hour the three
4630,ALEC AND ELFIE.,would spend together; and Alec and Arthur never appeared tired of seeing
4631,ALEC AND ELFIE.,Elfie go through the common dog's trick with a piece of sugar on his
4632,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"nose. When the word ""Trust"" was said to him, he let the sugar remain on"
4633,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"the tip of his nose, while he only squinted at it with all his might."
4634,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"Directly he heard the words ""Paid for"" he would jerk it into the air,"
4635,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"and snap it up as it fell. This is how the three are amusing themselves,"
4636,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"you see, in the picture."
4637,ALEC AND ELFIE.,
4638,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"One morning when it was very hot, Arthur's mamma and I were sitting"
4639,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"under the shade of some trees in the garden, working and reading. We"
4640,ALEC AND ELFIE.,knew that little Arthur was about somewhere in the garden or the grounds
4641,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"with his cousin Alec, who, we thought, was old enough to keep the little"
4642,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"one out of harm's way. Suddenly we heard a sound of panting and puffing,"
4643,ALEC AND ELFIE.,and saw Elfie tearing across the garden towards us. With his short legs
4644,ALEC AND ELFIE.,and long hair he appeared as if he was rolling over the ground: his
4645,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"little red tongue was hanging out of his mouth, and we could see his"
4646,ALEC AND ELFIE.,bright eyes gleaming with excitement through the overhanging locks of
4647,ALEC AND ELFIE.,hair.
4648,ALEC AND ELFIE.,
4649,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"""What can be the matter with the dog?"" exclaimed Arthur's mamma, jumping"
4650,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"up. ""Has he gone mad?"""
4651,ALEC AND ELFIE.,
4652,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"As she spoke, Elfie began barking furiously, and seizing her dress in"
4653,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"his mouth, tried to drag her away. A thought struck me, and I cried"
4654,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"out,--""Something is wrong with the boys, and Elfie has come to let us"
4655,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"know!"""
4656,ALEC AND ELFIE.,
4657,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"In the direction Elfie had come from, but hidden from our view by trees,"
4658,ALEC AND ELFIE.,was a large piece of water: towards this we hastened. Fortunately
4659,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"Arthur's papa was sitting in the library, of which the window was open:"
4660,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"we called to him as we ran, and he followed as fast as he could. Coming"
4661,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"in sight of the water, our worst fears were realized. Only a few yards"
4662,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"from the bank, but in quite deep water, we beheld the canoe floating"
4663,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"bottom upwards, and the two boys clinging to it; or rather, Alec"
4664,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"clinging to the canoe with one arm, and with the other supporting"
4665,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"Arthur, who had fainted."
4666,ALEC AND ELFIE.,
4667,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"The father plunged in instantly, and in a moment brought Arthur to"
4668,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"shore, and placed him in his mother's arms. Alec, left alone, easily"
4669,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"supported himself by the canoe till his uncle returned, and brought him"
4670,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"also on to the bank. The fault was Alec's, who had taken out the canoe"
4671,ALEC AND ELFIE.,from the boat-house without permission; but what praise could be too
4672,ALEC AND ELFIE.,"great for Elfie, who had probably saved two lives by his intelligence?"
4673,ALEC AND ELFIE.,We all agreed he was the most wonderful doggie in the world.

4714,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,The course of my story obliges me now to follow the doings of Maurice's
4715,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,cousin Eusèbe through one chapter. His goat Jeanne had died some time
4716,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"ago; to her had succeeded a monkey, then a dog; afterwards some birds,"
4717,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,and last of all a lamb. With his usual caprice these had all been
4718,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"discarded in turn, and he had at this moment no animal to pet or to"
4719,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"torment. It was a hot day towards the end of August, and Eusèbe lounged"
4720,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"about in one easy chair after another, trying in vain to occupy or amuse"
4721,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"himself. Suddenly, the idea occurred to him that he would like to pass a"
4722,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,few days in Paris.
4723,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4724,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,Now Mr. and Mrs. de Malassise were just thinking of going to stay for a
4725,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"few weeks at Dieppe, which was a place more suitable certainly for the"
4726,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,hot weather than Paris. But Eusèbe had taken a fancy to Paris; and to
4727,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"gain his point, he acted the little comedy which always succeeded so"
4728,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"well with his parents: he screamed, and rolled over and over on the"
4729,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"ground like a mad child. They were frightened, and started off with him"
4730,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"the very next morning, leaving the shady woods of Malassise for the dust"
4731,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"of the Boulevard des Italiens, where they usually lodged when they came"
4732,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,to Paris.
4733,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4734,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"On the afternoon of their arrival, Eusèbe asked his father to take him"
4735,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,for a walk as far as the square of the Bastille. He had heard that
4736,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"street-jugglers often performed their tricks there: and, hot as it was,"
4737,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"he insisted that his mamma, a delicate weak little woman, should walk"
4738,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,with them.
4739,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4740,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"They had walked as far as the gate of St. Denis, when a man approached"
4741,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"them, who had some little watches for sale fit for children. He went up"
4742,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"to Eusèbe, who, although such a big boy, was not above stopping to look"
4743,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,at the glittering watches with their bright chains attached. Then the
4744,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"man said in a low voice,--"
4745,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4746,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""Would you like to buy a beautiful horse, my prince?"""
4747,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4748,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"This title of prince was pleasant to the ears of Eusèbe, and with an air"
4749,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"of kind protection, he replied,--"
4750,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4751,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""What is it you ask, my good fellow?"""

4753,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""I ask if your lordship feels disposed to make the purchase of an"

4755,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4756,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""I have rocking-horses of all sorts and sizes,"" rejoined Eusèbe."
4757,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4758,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""I doubt it not, your Highness."""
4759,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4760,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,This title of highness completed the work of turning the little boy's
4761,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"head; and putting on the air of being a very great person, he said,--"
4762,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4763,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""Why, you seem to know who I am."""

4766,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4767,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,Now of course this cunning fellow did not really suppose that Eusèbe was
4768,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"either a prince or a lord, but saw very well that he was a spoilt child,"
4769,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,and thought it would be a good opportunity for selling Cressida--for
4770,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"Cressida it was that he was offering,--and he dared not sell it"
4771,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,publicly.
4772,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4773,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"Mr. and Mrs. de Malassise, who had walked on a little in front, now"
4774,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"stopped, and the former called out, ""What's the matter?"""
4775,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4776,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""Sir,"" replied the man, when he came up to them, ""I have a beautiful"

4778,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4779,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""Be off!"" said Mr. de Malassise, who did not like the look of the man;"
4780,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""we don't want to buy it."""
4781,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4782,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""Would you just come and see it, noble sir? it is at my house, only two"

4789,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4790,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""Papa, I want to see it,"" said Eusèbe."
4791,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4792,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""No, no, my dear,"" urged his father."

4794,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""Papa, I _will_ go to see the horse,"" and Eusèbe began to cry."
4795,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4796,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""Why oppose him, my dear?"" said Mrs. de Malassise, ""as he is so anxious"

4803,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""Oh, let us go and see the horse then, pray,"" said Mr. de Malassise,"
4804,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,resigning himself with rather a bad grace.
4805,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4806,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"They had followed their guide for about a quarter of a mile, when an"
4807,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"empty hackney-coach passed. The man stopped it, saying, ""Perhaps, sir,"
4808,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,the lady will be tired if she walks all the way; had you not better take
4809,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"this hackney-coach? I will get up on the box, and direct the driver."""
4810,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,

4812,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4813,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""Oh, it is not far,"" replied the man."
4814,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4815,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""Yes, yes, let us have the coach; I can't walk any more,"" exclaimed"

4817,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4818,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"So of course they got into the hackney-coach, while the man who had the"
4819,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"horse to sell seated himself beside the coachman. On they went, right"
4820,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"out of Paris, into the narrow streets of a suburb inhabited by very poor"
4821,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"people. On they went still, while the houses became more scattered, and"
4822,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,the roads were so bad that the horses could hardly get along.
4823,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4824,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"At last the coachman pulled up, and taking out his pipe, he began to"

4843,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,found it an amusing adventure.
4844,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4845,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"""I wish, now,"" he said, ""we were in Sicily, and then we might be"

4848,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4849,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,At this remark Eusèbe's mother began to laugh as if it were very funny
4850,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,and brilliant; even his father was almost restored to good humour by it.
4851,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"And when Eusèbe added--""only, neither that man nor the coachman are as"
4852,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"handsome as brigands""--the father and mother exchanged looks of"
4853,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,congratulation at the wit and humour of their son.
4854,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,
4855,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"They walked a short distance along the dirty, badly-paved street, and"
4856,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,entered a small low house almost in ruins. You may imagine how well it
4857,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"was furnished, when I tell you that Mrs. de Malassise was obliged to"
4858,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"stand, because the master of the house--that is, the man who conducted"
4859,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"them--had but one chair to offer her, and that was lame of two of its"
4860,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"legs. He opened a large closet, the door of which was concealed,"
4861,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"appearing only like a panel in the wall, and he led forth a pretty"
4862,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"little black horse, scarcely bigger than a large dog;--but I need not"

4866,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,

4870,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,to be so wonderful as he found this horse to be. He had no sooner seated

4872,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"of the horse caused the legs to move, and it walked round the room."
4873,EUSÈBE AT PARIS.--HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.,"Then, when Eusèbe in his delight very naturally began to pat it on the"

5158,HARES.,"they are! I think that one standing up in the middle, with his ears so"
5159,HARES.,"straight up, must be Mr. Hare, while the others are Mrs. Hare and the"
5160,HARES.,"children. They are eating away as fast as they can, while the good papa"
5161,HARES.,"looks on, and listens with those long ears of his for the sound of any"
5162,HARES.,approaching footsteps. If he hears any noise of a kind which he
5163,HARES.,"considers alarming, he will give notice to his wife and little ones;"
5164,HARES.,then they will all scurry off so fast that they will soon be miles away
5165,HARES.,from the spot where they have been frightened.
5166,HARES.,
5167,HARES.,"A hare never walks or trots, because the hind legs are so much longer"
5168,HARES.,"than the front ones, but it goes along in a succession of bounds. Hares"
5169,HARES.,"can take great leaps, too, in height as well as in distance: they have"
5170,HARES.,"been known, when pursued, to jump over very high hedges, and even walls"
5171,HARES.,of moderate size. One curious quality in a hare is that it never becomes
5172,HARES.,"fat, however rich the pasture may be on which it feeds; consequently it"
5173,HARES.,can go very long distances without fatigue.
5174,HARES.,
5175,HARES.,"Though rabbits are easily domesticated, it is very unusual to see a"
5176,HARES.,really tame hare; and you will be surprised to hear that the only one I
5177,HARES.,ever met with was in a house in London. I went one day to call upon a
5178,HARES.,"gentleman--an artist--who was very fond of animals: indeed, among other"
5179,HARES.,"things, he often painted animals. I found him in his studio, working"
5180,HARES.,"away at his picture, with three dogs and a cat and her kittens all in"
5181,HARES.,"the room with him. I sat for some time talking and admiring his picture,"
5182,HARES.,when presently I heard an odd sort of knocking or rubbing at the door.
5183,HARES.,
5184,HARES.,"""I hear some one at the door,"" said I, after the noise had been going on"
5185,HARES.,"for some time, thinking my friend did not hear it."
5186,HARES.,
5187,HARES.,"""Oh, that's only stupid old Tommy; he is such a bother; he never seems"
5188,HARES.,"able to settle anywhere now he's so old."""
5189,HARES.,
5190,HARES.,"""Who is he?"" I asked, thinking he was speaking of some stupid old"
5191,HARES.,person.
5192,HARES.,
5193,HARES.,"""Would you like to see him?"" said the artist; ""he is not particularly"
5194,HARES.,"handsome now, and he is dreadfully impudent."""
5195,HARES.,
5196,HARES.,"Walking to the door he opened it, and who should come hopping and"
5197,HARES.,"leaping into the room but a gigantic hare. He hopped past me first, and"
5198,HARES.,"then turning round, came quite close, and stood up on his hind legs. He"
5199,HARES.,"made one long ear stick forward and the other backward, looking more"
5200,HARES.,"comical than I can tell you; and he twisted his curious, sensitive,"
5201,HARES.,"moveable nose round and round, while he stared at me with his immense"
5202,HARES.,prominent eyes till I thought they were going to drop out.
5203,HARES.,
5204,HARES.,"""That isn't manners, Tommy,"" said my friend; ""it's very rude to stare"
5205,HARES.,"so: lie down."" Whereupon good obedient Tommy crouched down, with his"
5206,HARES.,"nose between his two front paws; laid his ears back flat on his neck,"
5207,HARES.,"and did his best, I am sure, not to stare--but that he could not help,"
5208,HARES.,by reason of the peculiar nature of his eyes.
5209,HARES.,
5210,HARES.,"I caressed him, and found him as tame and gentle as a little dog. Indeed"
5211,HARES.,my friend had had him from the time he was a very tiny creature.

5310,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"The next miracle that I shall tell you about, my dear children, is one"
5311,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,which is represented in the picture above; it is our Saviour giving
5312,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,sight to two blind men.
5313,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,
5314,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"When He left the house of Jairus, the ruler, whose daughter He had"
5315,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"raised from the dead, the scripture tells us that two blind men followed"
5316,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"Him. As they followed, they kept crying out, ""Thou son of David, have"
5317,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"mercy upon us!"" They meant by this entreaty to implore Christ to have"
5318,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,pity upon their darkness and misery; to consider how helpless and
5319,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"useless they were; and, as He had just restored to life a child already"
5320,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"dead, to have mercy upon them, and give them back their sight."
5321,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,
5322,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,It is evident that these men thoroughly believed our Saviour to be the
5323,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"true Messiah, whose coming had been foretold by the prophets; for one of"
5324,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"the signs by which the true Messiah was to be known, according to the"
5325,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"prophecies, was His giving sight to the blind."
5326,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,
5327,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"Our Saviour at first, as though to try the faith of these two poor men,"
5328,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,appeared not to regard them. But they followed Him into the house where
5329,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"He was going, groping their way as they best could, and repeated their"
5330,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"prayer, ""Oh, son of David, have mercy on us!"" Then Jesus, as St. Matthew"
5331,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"tells, said unto them, ""Believe ye that I am able to do this?"" and they"
5332,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"replied, ""Yea, Lord."" Then He touched their eyes, saying, ""According to"
5333,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"your faith be it done unto you."" And their eyes were opened."
5334,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,
5335,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,We may observe that Christ appeared to make faith a condition upon which
5336,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"the success of the miracle was to depend, and it is evident that these"
5337,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,poor men had perfect faith. What unspeakable joy and gratitude they must
5338,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,have felt on finding their dark night suddenly changed into bright day.
5339,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"Without pain, without any operation, simply by the touch of Christ upon"
5340,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"their sightless eyes, had one of the greatest of earthly blessings been"
5341,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,given to these two men.
5342,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,
5343,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"There is another miracle I shall have time to tell you about to-day, my"
5344,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"children, which was performed soon after the last. It consisted in the"
5345,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,feeding of a multitude of people--five thousand--upon five barley loaves
5346,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,and two small fishes. It took place on the shore of the sea of Galilee.
5347,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,
5348,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,A great multitude of people had followed our Saviour to listen to His
5349,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"teaching, and He had led them some distance away from any town. He"
5350,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"preached to them a long time, and was still continuing His instructions"
5351,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,when the shades of evening began to gather round. Then the disciples
5352,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"reminded Him that the day was declining, one of them saying, ""This is a"
5353,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"desert place, and now the time is far passed: send them away that they"
5354,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"may go into the country round about and buy themselves bread, for they"
5355,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"have nothing to eat."""
5356,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,
5357,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"But our Saviour was too compassionate to send the people away hungry,"
5358,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"and He intended Himself to give them food. He said to His disciples,"
5359,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"""How many loaves have ye? go and see."" And when they knew, they said,"
5360,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"""Five loaves and two fishes."" Christ then commanded them to make all the"
5361,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,people sit down upon the grass; He took the five loaves and the two
5362,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"fishes, and brake the loaves, and gave the pieces to His disciples to"
5363,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"give among the people: He also divided the two fishes, and gave them in"
5364,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"the same way. Then the multitude, as the Bible tells us, ate and were"
5365,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"filled: and, what is more, the disciples afterwards gathered up several"
5366,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,basketsful of the fragments that were left.
5367,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,
5368,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,"Thus, by our Lord's power, those five loaves and two fishes were made"
5369,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,sufficient to feed and satisfy that great multitude of five thousand
5370,THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.,people.

5386,DORA.,"I am sorry to say I have to tell you to-day of one of my little friends,"
5387,DORA.,whom I cannot hold up as an example to any of my little readers. Dora is
5388,DORA.,"an only child, and a very spoilt one too,--though I ought to mention"
5389,DORA.,that I think she is improving of late; and her improvement dates from
5390,DORA.,"the event I am going to describe. It was a severe lesson for her, but I"
5391,DORA.,hope and believe it will prove a useful one.
5392,DORA.,
5393,DORA.,"Dora had a very naughty and stupid habit, whenever she was found fault"
5394,DORA.,"with, of saying she would run away. One day, when the family were"
5395,DORA.,"staying at Hastings, nurse scolded her for drawing upon her books, and"
5396,DORA.,threatened to tell mamma.
5397,DORA.,
5398,DORA.,"""I like to draw upon my books, and I will!"" replied Dora; ""and if mamma"
5399,DORA.,"scolds me I shall run away."""
5400,DORA.,
5401,DORA.,"""Well,"" rejoined nurse, losing patience for once, as she afterwards"
5402,DORA.,"confessed, ""and it would be real kindness to us all, miss Dora, if you"
5403,DORA.,"did."""
5404,DORA.,
5405,DORA.,"Whereupon Dora walked out of the nursery, highly offended."
5406,DORA.,
5407,DORA.,A little while afterwards mamma asked for Dora to go out with her on to
5408,DORA.,the sands. The child was nowhere to be found. Nurse supposed her to have
5409,DORA.,gone into the drawing-room: mamma thought her still in the nursery. The
5410,DORA.,house was searched in vain. Then nurse remembered the conversation which
5411,DORA.,had taken place:--Dora had really run away!
5412,DORA.,
5413,DORA.,The alarm and distress of the father and mother were beyond description.
5414,DORA.,The child was only seven years old: what could have become of her?
5415,DORA.,Servants were sent out in all directions--on to the sands; to the pier;
5416,DORA.,into the streets: but she was nowhere to be found. Then nurse had a
5417,DORA.,"happy idea. You must know that in many country towns like Hastings, an"
5418,DORA.,"old custom is kept up of having a Town-crier. When people lose anything,"
5419,DORA.,"like a watch, a purse, or a dog, they employ this man. He goes about the"
5420,DORA.,"town ringing a bell to attract attention, and then reads from a piece of"
5421,DORA.,"paper, in a loud voice, a description of the thing lost; offering a"
5422,DORA.,reward for its discovery.
5423,DORA.,
5424,DORA.,Nurse very sensibly thought a lost child might be cried about the town
5425,DORA.,as well as anything else; and a handsome reward was offered for the
5426,DORA.,recovery of this naughty little girl.
5427,DORA.,
5428,DORA.,But what had become of Dora in the meantime? She had run out of the
5429,DORA.,"house suddenly in her fit of anger, carrying her doll in her arms, but"
5430,DORA.,without hat or jacket. At first she was delighted to find herself alone
5431,DORA.,"and free in the streets, and laughed as she thought how frightened nurse"
5432,DORA.,"would be. But after walking for a little while, she discovered that she"
5433,DORA.,"had lost herself: for she had only been at Hastings two or three days,"
5434,DORA.,and did not even know the name of the street she lived in. She had hoped
5435,DORA.,"to frighten nurse, but never thought of being frightened herself; yet"
5436,DORA.,that was what it had come to.
5437,DORA.,
5438,DORA.,She sat upon a doorstep and began to cry. Presently somebody spoke to
5439,DORA.,her. Then Dora thought of stories she had heard of children being
5440,DORA.,"stolen, and started up and ran away. So she wandered about for two or"
5441,DORA.,"three hours, till at last the Town-crier came close to where she stood"
5442,DORA.,"in a doorway. She heard him read the description of herself, and the"
5443,DORA.,people standing by recognised it also. The crier had a kind face; she
5444,DORA.,"let him take her by the hand, and thus was led home again, followed by a"
5445,DORA.,crowd of children.

5509,GROUSE.,For the subject of our natural history picture to-day we have some
5510,GROUSE.,"Grouse. There is a nice little family of grouse, consisting of papa,"
5511,GROUSE.,"mamma, and four children, all taking a pleasant walk among the heath and"
5512,GROUSE.,"fern. At the same time the old birds are searching for the wild berries,"
5513,GROUSE.,"the buds of the heath, and the seeds which form their principal food."
5514,GROUSE.,Look how eager the young ones are to have their share of some nice
5515,GROUSE.,"berries, which mamma grouse has just found!"
5516,GROUSE.,
5517,GROUSE.,"These birds are only met with on moors or wild heaths, and chiefly in"
5518,GROUSE.,mountainous countries; indeed Scotland is the country where they are now
5519,GROUSE.,"principally found, and people often go there on purpose for the"
5520,GROUSE.,grouse-shooting. I daresay some of my little readers already know that
5521,GROUSE.,"grouse-shooting begins on the 12th of August, a great day for sportsmen."
5522,GROUSE.,"From the way in which game is now preserved in England,"
5523,GROUSE.,partridge-shooting has come to be a tamer sport than it used to be. Many
5524,GROUSE.,brace of partridges may sometimes be brought down during a short walk
5525,GROUSE.,"over cultivated fields, and such sport seems less manly than taking long"
5526,GROUSE.,"fatiguing walks over breezy moors, as sportsmen have to do in search of"
5527,GROUSE.,grouse.
5528,GROUSE.,
5529,GROUSE.,"The grouse is a very wild and shy bird, and both skill and caution are"
5530,GROUSE.,"required in approaching them; they live in flocks, called ""packs,"" and"
5531,GROUSE.,"form their nests, as partridges do, upon the ground. Their plumage is a"
5532,GROUSE.,"rich brown, mottled with paler spots; the tail is black, with the"
5533,GROUSE.,"exception of four of the feathers, which have red marks on them: over"
5534,GROUSE.,"the eye also is a rough bare red spot. The bill of the grouse is short,"
5535,GROUSE.,"arched, and very strong; and the legs of this bird, as the winter"
5536,GROUSE.,"approaches, become feathered. As an article of food, the grouse is very"
5537,GROUSE.,"delicate, and has an excellent flavour."
5538,GROUSE.,
5539,GROUSE.,The bird I have been describing is the red grouse; that is in fact the
5540,GROUSE.,"common grouse. But there is also found in Scotland, though less"
5541,GROUSE.,"frequently, the black grouse, which is a much larger bird. The red"
5542,GROUSE.,grouse is rather bigger than a partridge.
5543,GROUSE.,
5544,GROUSE.,I once made the acquaintance of a tame grouse--one at least that had
5545,GROUSE.,been domesticated. The gentleman it belonged to had picked it up out of
5546,GROUSE.,its nest when a tiny thing on the moors in Scotland; and being a great
5547,GROUSE.,"bird-fancier, and having a collection, he had brought it in a cage to"
5548,GROUSE.,his house in Kent. When I saw Peter--that was the name given the
5549,GROUSE.,"grouse,--he was quite tame, but very ill-tempered. You might take him up"
5550,GROUSE.,"if you pleased, but he always pecked the hand that did so. Peter was"
5551,GROUSE.,"supposed to live habitually in a wicker cage, but in truth he had pretty"
5552,GROUSE.,well the run of the house. More than once he had taken flight beyond the
5553,GROUSE.,"premises, but had returned for his food. One day however he was missed,"
5554,GROUSE.,and never came back. His fate may be surmised from the fact that about
5555,GROUSE.,"the same time a party of gentlemen in the neighbourhood, being out"
5556,GROUSE.,shooting--it was September--were surprised to find a grouse among the
5557,GROUSE.,game they had killed.

5573,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5574,MENDS THE HORSE.,"A few days after Eusèbe came into possession of the horse, in the way"
5575,MENDS THE HORSE.,"described in the last chapter, he went off with his father and mother to"
5576,MENDS THE HORSE.,"Dieppe for sea-bathing. He took Cressida with him, for he wished to show"
5577,MENDS THE HORSE.,it to some little friends whom he expected to meet there.
5578,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5579,MENDS THE HORSE.,His fondness for the wooden horse did not last long. Instead of being
5580,MENDS THE HORSE.,"reasonable and gentle with it, like Maurice, he was continually wanting"
5581,MENDS THE HORSE.,this ingenious automaton to do more than it was intended to do. When it
5582,MENDS THE HORSE.,"failed, he would grow impatient, call it obstinate, and beat it with all"
5583,MENDS THE HORSE.,"his might; sometimes he would spitefully pull the hair from its mane,"
5584,MENDS THE HORSE.,and try to tear out its eyes. The best that could happen for the poor
5585,MENDS THE HORSE.,"little horse now would be for its master to get tired of it, and cast it"
5586,MENDS THE HORSE.,aside entirely.
5587,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5588,MENDS THE HORSE.,[Illustration: THE RECOIL OF THE PISTOL THREW HIM ON HIS BACK.]
5589,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5590,MENDS THE HORSE.,The garden of the house occupied by Mr. and Mrs. de Malassise at Dieppe
5591,MENDS THE HORSE.,"was ornamented with grottoes, rocks, cascades, rivulets, all in"
5592,MENDS THE HORSE.,"miniature, as if intended to amuse children. Eusèbe was fond of jumping"
5593,MENDS THE HORSE.,"about among the rocks and rivulets, and one day he took it into his head"
5594,MENDS THE HORSE.,that Cressida should do the same. He took the horse at a gallop up to a
5595,MENDS THE HORSE.,"little stream, only two or three feet wide, intending it to leap across;"
5596,MENDS THE HORSE.,"but it galloped into the water instead, leaping not being one of the"
5597,MENDS THE HORSE.,movements it was constructed to make. Eusèbe took it up to the water two
5598,MENDS THE HORSE.,"or three times, not sparing threats or blows while he did so, but in"
5599,MENDS THE HORSE.,"vain. Then he began to scream, as usual when he was in a rage, and"
5600,MENDS THE HORSE.,"looking about for some means of satisfying his anger, he remembered that"
5601,MENDS THE HORSE.,his father kept a loaded pistol on the upper shelf of a closet in his
5602,MENDS THE HORSE.,"dressing-room. He ran upstairs, and by mounting on a chair, contrived to"
5603,MENDS THE HORSE.,"reach the pistol, which was a double-barrelled one. Returning again into"
5604,MENDS THE HORSE.,"the garden, and still as furious as ever against the poor little horse,"
5605,MENDS THE HORSE.,he went close up to it and fired off both barrels at once.
5606,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5607,MENDS THE HORSE.,The horse was not so much damaged as Eusèbe himself. The child held the
5608,MENDS THE HORSE.,"pistol in both hands, the left hand being close to the muzzle, and the"
5609,MENDS THE HORSE.,result of his exploit was that not only did the recoil of the pistol
5610,MENDS THE HORSE.,"throw him down on his back, but his hand was wounded and burnt by the"
5611,MENDS THE HORSE.,"explosion. He fainted from the pain, and in this state was picked up by"
5612,MENDS THE HORSE.,"his father, who ran into the garden at the sound of the shot."
5613,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5614,MENDS THE HORSE.,"Mr. and Mrs. de Malassise, instead of being angry with their son, laid"
5615,MENDS THE HORSE.,the blame of the accident on the unfortunate horse; and a servant was at
5616,MENDS THE HORSE.,"once ordered to break it in pieces, and throw it upon the fire."
5617,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5618,MENDS THE HORSE.,"In consequence of this accident Eusèbe had an attack of fever, and was"
5619,MENDS THE HORSE.,obliged to keep his bed for some days. Most children in his place would
5620,MENDS THE HORSE.,have been taught a useful lesson by the suffering he thus brought upon
5621,MENDS THE HORSE.,himself. Not so Eusèbe: he only took advantage of the anxiety his
5622,MENDS THE HORSE.,"parents felt about him, to be more tyrannical and capricious than"
5623,MENDS THE HORSE.,before.
5624,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5625,MENDS THE HORSE.,About this time Mr. and Mrs. de Roisel came also with their son to pass
5626,MENDS THE HORSE.,"a few weeks at Dieppe, and Eusèbe was not yet quite restored to health"
5627,MENDS THE HORSE.,when my little friend went to see him. With tears in their eyes Eusèbe's
5628,MENDS THE HORSE.,parents related the accident which had happened to their dear child; and
5629,MENDS THE HORSE.,it did not seem to occur to them that there was anything in the affair
5630,MENDS THE HORSE.,for which he could be found fault with. But Maurice felt indignant at
5631,MENDS THE HORSE.,what he considered cruelty even towards a wooden horse. He was thinking
5632,MENDS THE HORSE.,of Cressida while he listened to the story; but as Eusèbe's horse was
5633,MENDS THE HORSE.,"not particularly described by his parents, it never occurred to Maurice"
5634,MENDS THE HORSE.,that it could be his own lost Cressida.
5635,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5636,MENDS THE HORSE.,A few mornings later Maurice was taking a country walk with his father
5637,MENDS THE HORSE.,"and mother a little way out of Dieppe, when, as they approached a small"
5638,MENDS THE HORSE.,"village, they heard the loud and angry voices of children."
5639,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5640,MENDS THE HORSE.,"""Gee-up, gee-up! Get on, lazy beast!"" said one voice."
5641,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5642,MENDS THE HORSE.,"""He can't carry so many,"" said another."
5643,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5644,MENDS THE HORSE.,"""He can't move!"" exclaimed a third."
5645,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5646,MENDS THE HORSE.,"""I tell you he can."""
5647,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5648,MENDS THE HORSE.,"""Tell you he can't."""
5649,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5650,MENDS THE HORSE.,"""You shall see. Hi! Gee-up, gee-up! Go along!"" and immediately the sound"
5651,MENDS THE HORSE.,"of a shower of blows, rained upon the back of some poor animal, reached"
5652,MENDS THE HORSE.,"the ears of Maurice, who, without stopping to reflect, ran as fast as"
5653,MENDS THE HORSE.,"legs of eight years old can run, in the direction of the noise."
5654,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5655,MENDS THE HORSE.,"He stopped at the entrance to a farm, where, in the courtyard, he saw"
5656,MENDS THE HORSE.,"five or six boys, and as many little girls, all clustered round a small"
5657,MENDS THE HORSE.,pony. Two boys and a girl had contrived to seat themselves upon its
5658,MENDS THE HORSE.,"back; two or three more were dragging it along by the bridle, while"
5659,MENDS THE HORSE.,another beat it with a stick behind. The pony hung down its head in a
5660,MENDS THE HORSE.,"way that was pitiful to see; it appeared to have a shoulder dislocated,"
5661,MENDS THE HORSE.,"and a leg was broken above the knee, and bandaged up. Its difficulty in"
5662,MENDS THE HORSE.,"""going along"" seemed quite accounted for."
5663,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5664,MENDS THE HORSE.,"""Are you not ashamed,"" cried my little friend, ""to ride, three of you at"
5665,MENDS THE HORSE.,"once, upon a little pony who is lame and ill?"""
5666,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5667,MENDS THE HORSE.,"At first the boys were inclined to answer by some impertinence, but"
5668,MENDS THE HORSE.,"seeing Mr. and Mrs. de Roisel coming up behind Maurice, they rather"
5669,MENDS THE HORSE.,"sulkily got down from the pony. Then the poor animal, relieved from"
5670,MENDS THE HORSE.,"their weight, raised its drooping head, and a sudden suspicion flashed"
5671,MENDS THE HORSE.,"across the mind of Maurice. He cried out,--"
5672,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5673,MENDS THE HORSE.,"""Oh! it is Cressida!"""
5674,MENDS THE HORSE.,
5675,MENDS THE HORSE.,Maurice ran back to his parents to tell them of his discovery; but
5676,MENDS THE HORSE.,"instead of explaining himself, he could only say,--""Come, come quickly!"""

5685,BACK.],"Cressida. It was one of the boys present: but the mother of this boy,"

5715,BACK.],
5716,BACK.],"""May God for ever bless you, my good gentleman,"" said she, astonished at"

5719,BACK.],
5720,BACK.],"When Eusèbe heard how Maurice had recovered Cressida, he was furious,"
5721,BACK.],and wanted the servant to be immediately sent away who had spared the

5723,BACK.],"of the circumstances under which he had bought the horse, and spoke of"

5727,BACK.],who had broken into Mr. Duberger's house. His accomplice was a man who
5728,BACK.],"went about the country as a pedlar, selling ribbons, silk-handkerchiefs,"
5729,BACK.],"and toys. In this way he used to obtain access to houses, learning where"
5730,BACK.],"valuable things were kept, and what were the habits of the family. The"

5893,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"This picture reminds me, children, of some funny stories that I have"
5894,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"heard your Uncle John tell, when he and I were boy and girl together, of"
5895,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"his exploits as a schoolboy. According to his account, not only he, but"
5896,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"most of his schoolfellows, used to lead merry lives enough at school."
5897,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"They had a great deal of what he called excellent fun, though I am"
5898,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,afraid it sometimes bordered upon mischief or naughtiness. I used to
5899,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"consider that he and his schoolfellows were regular heroes, as I"
5900,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,listened to his stories when he came home for the holidays; and even now
5901,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,I must confess I cannot help laughing when I think of some of his
5902,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,naughty pranks.
5903,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5904,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Uncle John first went to a large school when he was eleven years old,"
5905,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,and I remember now the tremendous hamper of good things he took with
5906,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,him. The boys who slept in his bedroom were so pleased with the contents
5907,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,of his hamper that they determined to make a great feast. To add to
5908,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,their enjoyment they imagined themselves to be settlers in the back
5909,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"woods of America or Australia. They built a log-hut with bolsters, and"
5910,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,had a sort of pic-nic. One of them mounted on the top of the log-hut to
5911,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"look out with his telescope for any approaching savages, while the"
5912,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,others enjoyed their suppers in and about the hut. When their fun was at
5913,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"its height, the door softly opened, and in walked Dr. Birchall,"
5914,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"spectacles on nose, and cane in hand. What followed may be imagined."
5915,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5916,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"You would not recognize Uncle John himself, whom you know only as a man"
5917,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"six feet high, in that little lad on the right hand side of the picture,"
5918,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,half hiding under the bedclothes. As a new boy he had no share either in
5919,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,the riot or its punishment; except indeed in so far as his hamper had
5920,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"supplied the means of riot. Still, what he saw made a deep impression on"
5921,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,his mind; and particularly he thought a great deal of the inconvenience
5922,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,arising from the sudden appearance of the master.
5923,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5924,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"You know that Uncle John is an engineer now, and even as a little boy he"
5925,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"had a great turn for mechanical inventions. Well, he pondered over some"
5926,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,means by which such a sudden interruption to the enjoyment of his
5927,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,schoolfellows might be prevented in future; and I will tell you what he
5928,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,did.
5929,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5930,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,It happened that the large room in which he slept formed the upper floor
5931,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"of a wing of the house, which had been added to it when it became a"
5932,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,school; and there was no access to this room from the principal
5933,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"staircase of the house. You had to pass through the room below, and go"
5934,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,up a little separate staircase to reach to floor above. The lower room
5935,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"was also a bedroom for the boys, and Uncle John's little scheme was"
5936,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,this:--
5937,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5938,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,He made a hole with a gimlet in the frame of one of the windows of his
5939,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"bedroom, passed a piece of string through the hole, and carried it"
5940,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,outside the wall of the house down to a similar hole in a window-frame
5941,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,of the room below. To the end of the string in the upper room was
5942,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"fastened a small rattle, while the other end of the string--that in the"
5943,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,room below--was taken into the bed of a boy who slept near the window.
5944,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5945,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"This admirable little invention once in order, there was more rioting in"
5946,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"the upper room than ever; and the master, disturbed by the noise, soon"
5947,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"went, cane in hand, to stop it. The instant he set foot in the lower"
5948,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"room, the boy there who held the string in bed gave it a little pull;"
5949,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"the rattle sounded--ting! ting!--in the room above, and in an instant"
5950,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,every boy was in bed and snoring. Perhaps they had been playing at
5951,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"leap-frog the moment before, but as Dr. Birchall entered the room--and"
5952,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,he crept up the staircase very quietly that he might catch them
5953,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"unawares--he found some twenty boys lying in bed, seemingly sound"
5954,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"asleep, though snoring unnaturally loud."
5955,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5956,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,The doctor was so disconcerted by this unexpected state of things that
5957,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"he retired at once, fancying perhaps that his ears had deceived him when"
5958,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,he thought he had heard a noise in the room. The same thing happened two
5959,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"or three times: the doctor was puzzled, and the invention appeared a"
5960,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,complete success; but at last all was discovered.
5961,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5962,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,[Illustration: Tossing in the blanket]
5963,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5964,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"The boys one evening began imprudently to play at ""Tossing in the"
5965,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"blanket"" before they were undressed. The rattle sounded, and they had"
5966,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"just time to hide away the blanket. But the doctor coming in, and"
5967,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"finding they were only then beginning to undress, knew they must have"
5968,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"been at some mischief, and began questioning one after another."
5969,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Unluckily, while he was in the room the rattle sounded again by"
5970,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,accident: perhaps the boy in the room below had pulled the string by
5971,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"moving in bed. The doctor looked about, found the rattle hanging just"
5972,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"below the window, saw the string, opened the window, and traced its"
5973,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"course outside, went down into the room below and understood the whole"
5974,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"arrangement. Then he put the rattle in his pocket, and went away without"
5975,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,saying a word. The boys declared he had such difficulty in keeping
5976,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"himself from laughing, that he was afraid to speak lest he should burst"
5977,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,out.
5978,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5979,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"However, next day every boy in that room had a slight punishment, and so"
5980,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,the matter ended.
5981,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5982,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,Now I will tell you another of Uncle John's pranks at school. There was
5983,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"a large tree in the playground, the upper branches of which spread out"
5984,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,very near to the windows of the bedroom I have been describing. One
5985,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"evening Uncle John got hold of a large hand-bell, which was used for"
5986,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"ringing the boys up in the morning, and climbing up the tree, he"
5987,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,fastened it by a piece of string to a branch near the top. Then another
5988,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,boy threw him the end of a long string from a window of the bedroom into
5989,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"the tree, and he fastened it to the bell in such a way that, when it was"
5990,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"pulled in the bedroom, it made the bell ring in the tree. Having"
5991,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"accomplished this arrangement, he came down from the tree and went to"
5992,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,bed.
5993,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
5994,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,At ten o'clock at night the household was disturbed by the loud ringing
5995,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"of this bell. The master, in his dressing-gown, came out into the"
5996,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,playground and soon discovered where the sound came from; but of course
5997,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"supposed that some boy had climbed up into the tree, and was ringing the"
5998,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"bell there. It was the middle of summer, and a beautiful moonlight"
5999,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"night, so the boys could see from the windows all that took place. Dr."
6000,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Birchall stood at the foot of the tree, looking up, and exclaimed"
6001,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"angrily,--"
6002,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
6003,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""Come down, you naughty boy! Come down, I say, directly. Oh, I'll give"
6004,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"you such a flogging! Stop that horrible noise, I tell you, and come"
6005,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"down!"""
6006,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
6007,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,The bell still went on ringing. At last the string--being pulled too
6008,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"hard, I suppose, in the excitement of the fun--broke; and the bell"
6009,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"tumbled down from the top of the tree, falling very near the old"
6010,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,schoolmaster. This was worse than all.
6011,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
6012,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""What!"" he exclaimed, ""you throw the bell at me? Why, if it had hit me"
6013,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"on the head, it might have killed me. Oh, you wicked boy! I'll expel"
6014,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"you, sir. I'll find out who you are if I stop here till morning."""
6015,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
6016,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"At last, however, his patience was exhausted, and he went away, but left"
6017,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,an old butler to watch the tree all night. The boys from the windows
6018,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,could see this man settle himself comfortably on a seat which was at the
6019,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"foot of the tree. He lighted his pipe, and prepared to carry out his"
6020,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"master's orders, and watch till daylight. By three o'clock in the"
6021,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,morning the dawn broke; then the man began to look up occasionally into
6022,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"the tree. Now and then he walked a little distance away, first in one"
6023,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"direction, and then in another, to look into parts of the tree that he"
6024,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"could not see from underneath. He kept this up till the sun had risen,"
6025,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,and it was broad daylight; then at last he became convinced that it was
6026,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,impossible there could be a boy in the tree. He walked slowly into the
6027,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"house, still smoking his pipe, with a puzzled expression on his face."
6028,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
6029,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,And I suspect he was not the only person who felt puzzled. The next day
6030,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"the boys were going home for the holidays, so that no further inquiry"
6031,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,could be made. I wonder if Dr. Birchall ever found out how it had been
6032,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,managed!

6098,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,
6099,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"As evening came on, the multitude that had been fed, dispersed; and"
6100,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"Christ desired His disciples to enter into their boat, and go before Him"
6101,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"to the town of Bethsaida, where they might pass the night, while He went"

6105,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"The disciples had not gone far upon their voyage, when the light breeze"

6107,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"It had become dark, ""and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that"
6108,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"blew, and the ship was tossed with the waves."" They were overtaken in"
6109,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"fact by one of those sudden squalls to which the lake, or sea of Galilee"
6110,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,is liable. In vain they rowed with all their strength; the contrary wind
6111,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,drove them out of their course into the middle of the lake.
6112,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,
6113,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"In such an hour of danger they must have thought of the time, not long"
6114,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"before, when they were caught in another storm on the same sea. But then"
6115,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,their Master was with them in the boat; at His command the sea became
6116,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"calm, and the wind ceased. How they must have wished that He were with"
6117,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"them now, or that they could call Him to them, that His voice might once"
6118,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"more hush the tempest into peace, and control the winds and waves! They"
6119,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"had entered the fourth watch of the night, which, as the night was"
6120,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"divided into only four watches, means that the morning was approaching,"
6121,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"and the storm was still raging fiercely, when they beheld a human figure"
6122,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"approaching, walking on the surface of the water as if upon firm ground."
6123,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,
6124,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"Sailors and fishermen have been in all ages superstitious, and those of"

6128,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"seems to have been the first that entered the minds of the disciples, as"
6129,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,they saw the figure approaching on the water. What followed is thus
6130,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,described by St. Matthew:--
6131,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,
6132,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"""And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled,"
6133,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. But straightway"
6134,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid."
6135,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"And Peter answered Him, and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto"
6136,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"thee on the water. And Jesus said, Come. And when Peter was come down"
6137,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"out of the ship, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. But when he saw"
6138,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried,"
6139,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"saying, Lord, save me! And immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand,"
6140,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore"
6141,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"didst thou doubt?"""
6142,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,
6143,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"The want of a thorough, unbounded faith and confidence in the power and"
6144,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"divinity of our Saviour, was a fault which He had to contend against"
6145,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"even in the disciples, who beheld His miracles almost daily. Peter and"
6146,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"others who were in the boat became afterwards apostles of Christianity,"
6147,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"and performed miracles themselves, when their faith must have become"
6148,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,perfect; but it seems to have grown up gradually; and the words of
6149,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,Christ signify that Peter failed to walk on the water himself on this
6150,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,occasion only through his want of faith.
6151,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,
6152,CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.,"St. Matthew goes on to tell us that when our Saviour came into the ship,"

6188,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,and entered at the door of a sort of kitchen which I found open. The
6189,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"proper entrance to the cottage, it appears, is from the road at the"
6190,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"other side, where there is a little garden. However, I went in, and"
6191,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"finding the kitchen empty, went through it to another open door leading"
6192,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"into a sitting-room. Through this door, without being observed myself, I"
6193,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,beheld one of the pleasantest sights that has ever met my eyes.
6194,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
6195,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,The children had evidently been out to meet their father on his way home
6196,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"from work, and they were all coming through the garden and just entering"
6197,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"the opposite door together, as you see them in the picture. Sammy"
6198,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"marched in front, carrying his father's basket of tools upon his"
6199,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,shoulder as proudly as if he bore a treasure. Father himself was
6200,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"carrying little Topsey, the youngest child, upon _his_ shoulder, who"
6201,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,pulled his hair and crowed and laughed all the time; while the other two
6202,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"children, Mary Jane and Florence Bessy, walked, or rather jumped and"
6203,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"danced, on either side of him. The old man in the cottage was smiling a"
6204,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"welcome to them as they came in: in short every face, from the youngest"
6205,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"to the eldest there, looked bright and happy."
6206,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
6207,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"As I stood there observing, I mentally thanked heaven for the happiness"
6208,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,which love and good temper can bring to the poorest cottage. My presence
6209,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"was soon noticed: my old nurse appeared heartily glad to see me, and"
6210,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"showed me her grandchildren with great pride; but I did not remain long,"
6211,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"for I saw that their tea was ready, and I was disturbing them."
6212,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,Afterwards I was often at the cottage; but I must hasten on to describe
6213,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,what first made me rank Sammy among my little friends.
6214,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
6215,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"One morning I was rambling along the shore, sometimes walking on the"
6216,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"sand, sometimes on the slippery green rocks, reading occasionally a few"
6217,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"lines of a book I had in my hand, but more frequently looking out to sea"
6218,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"and watching the fishing boats riding bravely on the waves, when I"
6219,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"suddenly became aware that the tide had risen quickly, and that I was"
6220,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,hemmed in on a sort of island. I found water in front and on each side
6221,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"of me, while behind me was a ridge of rocks too rugged and slippery to"
6222,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,climb.
6223,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
6224,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"Now my life was in no danger I daresay, but the prospect of having to"
6225,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"walk through the water up to my knees was disagreeable. Very near me,"
6226,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"but separated by some impassable rocks, stood the cottage of my old"
6227,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"nurse, looking tranquil and pretty in the sunshine; while close by it,"
6228,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"in a little cove formed by a wooden breakwater, a small boat was moored."
6229,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,I approached as near as I could and called for help. Presently little
6230,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,Sammy made his appearance in answer to my cries; but instead of
6231,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"returning into the cottage to obtain help from some grown-up person, he"
6232,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"set to work at once to unmoor the boat, jumped into it, and began"
6233,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,paddling along with a single oar round the breakwater and the rocks to
6234,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,where I stood.
6235,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
6236,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"I was in an agony of fear lest he should be carried out to sea, for he"
6237,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,was certainly too little and too weak to have made head against any
6238,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"current or wind that there might be. However, the boat soon touched the"
6239,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"sand close to me. I scrambled in, getting very wet the while, and then"
6240,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,by our united efforts we got her off again and paddled her round to her
6241,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,own little harbour.
6242,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
6243,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"Once in safety, I exclaimed: ""Oh, Sammy, how dangerous for you to come"
6244,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"alone! why didn't you call somebody?"""
6245,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
6246,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"""I thought you'd drown furst,"" said Sammy, with a grin; ""but"
6247,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"grandfather's ill and father's out, so I wor the only man at home, yer"
6248,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"see."""
6249,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
6250,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"""And a true little man you are,"" said I to my friend Sammy; and I am"
6251,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,sure my little readers think so too.

6301,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,We must suppose that an interval of a year and a half has passed since

6303,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"de Roisel are staying at Paris, as usual during the winter; and this"

6307,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"Maurice had met Adrienne again in the Luxembourg gardens, and at length"

6309,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,
6310,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"The dinner was in the middle of the day on account of the children, and"
6311,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"afterwards, to amuse them as they sat round the fire, a singular sort of"
6312,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,game was introduced. All were to confess in turn such faults or follies
6313,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"as they were conscious of in themselves, and to relate what bad, or"
6314,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"silly, or ridiculous actions these faults had led them into,--it being"
6315,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,understood that the grown-up people were only to speak of the faults and
6316,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,follies of their childhood.
6317,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,
6318,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,They had just settled down to the game when Mr. Duberger came in. He
6319,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"joined in it at once, and related, with great goodnature and perfect"
6320,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"candour and simplicity, a multitude of absurdities and mistakes which he"
6321,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"had committed in complete innocence, but through negligence and absence"
6322,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,of mind. He made every one laugh heartily at his stories.
6323,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,
6324,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"Eusèbe was the only one of the party who had nothing to relate, for he"
6325,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,knew of no imperfection in himself. Some of those present tried to help
6326,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,his memory a little; but no! he could remember no fault he had ever
6327,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"committed. He recollected, and related, only deeds of heroism, which did"
6328,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,not fail to cause a slight astonishment in his hearers.

6330,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"Adrienne, who, under the watchful care of her governess, had much"
6331,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"improved in character since we knew her before, spoke of her own caprice"

6347,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,close by. Adrienne heard that he had left a widow and children in the

6364,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,
6365,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,The name of Fritz's niece--the poor woman whom Maurice had helped--was
6366,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"known to every one present; it was known also that her husband, having"
6367,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"already made a good fortune in America, was about to return to Europe"
6368,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"with his family, but their arrival at this time was unexpected. Their"
6369,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"dress showed that they had but just come off a journey, and it was"
6370,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"evident that, on arriving in Paris, their first thought had been to pay"

6373,GOLD.--UNEXPECTED VISITORS.--A HAPPY MEETING.,"Finding so many persons in the room, the new-comers stood for a moment"

6416,CONCLUSION.,
6417,CONCLUSION.,Something tells me that among my little readers there may be a
6418,CONCLUSION.,few--perhaps the oldest or most clever--who wish to ask me certain
6419,CONCLUSION.,questions. They may say to me:--
6420,CONCLUSION.,
6421,CONCLUSION.,"""Now what moral lesson do you draw from your story? That boy, Eusèbe,"
6422,CONCLUSION.,"who is about the naughtiest and most disagreeable boy that ever lived,"
6423,CONCLUSION.,"is left just as well off, and as happy as the dear good little Maurice."
6424,CONCLUSION.,An author can make shadow or sunshine fall upon his paper as he pleases:
6425,CONCLUSION.,"then he should punish the bad, and make the good happy."""
6426,CONCLUSION.,
6427,CONCLUSION.,"In reply, I say to you: My dear little gentlemen and my pretty young"
6428,CONCLUSION.,"ladies, you must know that Providence, which watches over us from above,"
6429,CONCLUSION.,"does not institute special rewards for virtue, as men may do; nor has"
6430,CONCLUSION.,any system like ours for punishing the bad. Yet Providence is always
6431,CONCLUSION.,just. To those who do good no other reward is sometimes accorded than
6432,CONCLUSION.,"that of being good: but, in truth, that is the best reward of all. If a"
6433,CONCLUSION.,"man bestow charity in the hope that God will, as a reward, render him"
6434,CONCLUSION.,"prosperous, he is not really charitable, but only a speculator who risks"
6435,CONCLUSION.,a little in the hope that he may gain much. Nor can we always see how
6436,CONCLUSION.,"Providence punishes the bad. They may be rich and prosperous, yet they"
6437,CONCLUSION.,"may suffer from the hatred that is in their hearts, and from the envy"
6438,CONCLUSION.,they feel towards those who appear happy.
6439,CONCLUSION.,
6440,CONCLUSION.,But to satisfy my little readers I will leap over the fifteen years
6441,CONCLUSION.,"which separate the present time from that at which my story began, and"
6442,CONCLUSION.,see what has become of the principal characters.
6443,CONCLUSION.,
6444,CONCLUSION.,"To begin with Eusèbe. You may meet him everywhere; at the theatres, in"
6445,CONCLUSION.,"the park, at races, always with his glass in his eye, generally with a"
6446,CONCLUSION.,"cigar in his mouth, and dressed in a conspicuous and ridiculous fashion."
6447,CONCLUSION.,But you may ask perhaps what he does? Nothing: that is the only thing he
6448,CONCLUSION.,is capable of doing. With a cold heart and an empty head he has no
6449,CONCLUSION.,"friendships, nor has he intellect enough even to enjoy his amusements."
6450,CONCLUSION.,
6451,CONCLUSION.,"That attack of the nerves which his parents always dreaded, but which"
6452,CONCLUSION.,"never came, was an excuse for not working at college; and when his"
6453,CONCLUSION.,"education was supposed to be finished, it was discovered one fine day"
6454,CONCLUSION.,that he knew nothing and was fit for nothing. But I am forgetting: he
6455,CONCLUSION.,"has one occupation, which is the misery of his life. His occupation is"
6456,CONCLUSION.,to envy. When any of his old college companions or his schoolfellows are
6457,CONCLUSION.,"successful in literature, science, or art, he is miserable. It is"
6458,CONCLUSION.,torture to him to hear them praised. He does what he can to detract from
6459,CONCLUSION.,their merit and renown; and finds a certain satisfaction--perhaps a
6460,CONCLUSION.,slight consolation--in laughing at them for their application and
6461,CONCLUSION.,industry.
6462,CONCLUSION.,
6463,CONCLUSION.,"""How a fellow can be such a fool as to work hard in that way!"" he will"
6464,CONCLUSION.,say with an air of superiority.
6465,CONCLUSION.,
6466,CONCLUSION.,"In short, Eusèbe would like to sweep away all genius, talent, and wit"
6467,CONCLUSION.,"from the face of the earth, and when there remained only fools upon it,"
6468,CONCLUSION.,"he might be king among them. And now, my little readers, what do you"
6469,CONCLUSION.,"think of Eusèbe? Is he happy, do you suppose?"

6558,GOATS.,"the little kid there, standing on his hind legs, reaches up to eat,"
6559,GOATS.,while the other little fellow stands with pricked-up ears and wide-open
6560,GOATS.,"eyes, holding a sprig of some tree in his mouth. He has heard a noise,"
6561,GOATS.,"and is on the watch, fearful lest some enemy should come, and ready to"
6562,GOATS.,spring away in a moment.
6563,GOATS.,
6564,GOATS.,This picture just represents a family of common European goats. They are
6565,GOATS.,"fleet, active creatures. In their wild state they delight in climbing"
6566,GOATS.,"rocks, and bounding about at the edge of precipices, as sure-footed as"
6567,GOATS.,the chamois. Even our tame goats here at home are so fond of climbing
6568,GOATS.,"that they always get on to some high place, even on to the tops of"
6569,GOATS.,"houses or outbuildings, when they have a chance."
6570,GOATS.,
6571,GOATS.,"You know, children, how tame and gentle these creatures can be made, for"
6572,GOATS.,"I am sure there is scarcely one of the readers of ""Wide-Awake"" but has"

6576,GOATS.,"while, and that the poor goat's mouth has not been jerked and dragged"
6577,GOATS.,till every tooth in its head ached. And how about the whips? Goats'
6578,GOATS.,"skins are not very sensitive perhaps, but I am terribly afraid that some"
6579,GOATS.,little children whip their goats till they must smart again. Now if your
6580,GOATS.,consciences accuse you--and I address myself to any of my little
6581,GOATS.,"readers--make up your minds never to be cruel to goats, or any other"

6584,GOATS.,
6585,GOATS.,When I was in India I had a number of goats: they were kept to give
6586,GOATS.,"milk. I grew quite fond of them, and they knew me so well that they"
6587,GOATS.,"would come trotting after me, baaing at me for bread or sugar, whenever"
6588,GOATS.,I walked out in the compound. There was only one disagreeable quality
6589,GOATS.,"about my goats: they were not sweet-smelling, and on that account were"
6590,GOATS.,not very pleasant pets.
6591,GOATS.,
6592,GOATS.,I have been told that at the Cape of Good Hope large flocks of these
6593,GOATS.,"animals are kept, and they are very sagacious, requiring no goat-herd to"
6594,GOATS.,look after them. In this respect they are very different from sheep:
6595,GOATS.,they start off in an orderly flock of their own accord to find their
6596,GOATS.,"food in the morning, and they return in the same orderly fashion in the"
6597,GOATS.,evening.
6598,GOATS.,
6599,GOATS.,Goats are almost the only animals that will face fire. On some occasions
6600,GOATS.,"when stables have caught fire, they have been known to save the lives of"

6602,GOATS.,through smoke and flame out of the burning stables.

6621,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,something between a Newfoundland and a Mount St. Bernard. He belonged to
6622,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"my old nurse and foster-mother, who lived on a little farm not very far"
6623,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"from Marseilles. Her husband, who was now a farmer, had once been a"

6629,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,considered necessary for my complete cure. How I enjoyed the visit I can
6630,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"scarcely tell you. I had everything entirely my own way, and of course"
6631,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"had a holiday from all lessons. From the moment I entered the house,"
6632,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"Tiger adopted me as his playfellow and friend. I loved him dearly, and"
6633,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"had a great respect for him at the same time, for never was dog at once"
6634,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"so gentle and so terrible. He would jump upon me to caress me, and knock"
6635,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"me down flat under the weight of his great paws, while I in turn used to"
6636,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"sit upon his back, roll on the top of him when he was resting, and"

6643,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"""One evening, at twilight, I was out playing with my little"

6649,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"""'Ah,' cried little Pierrette, shuddering, 'this frightful ghost makes"

6651,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,
6652,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"""'Nonsense,' I answered, 'a boy ought never to be frightened----.' I got"
6653,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"so far when, to my horror, I saw, coming out of the dark wood, a tall"
6654,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"white figure, which came walking slowly towards us. As it approached"
6655,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"slowly, slowly, a cold shiver ran down my back, my eyes seemed starting"
6656,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"from my head, and shrieking out, 'The ghost, the ghost!' I ran back"
6657,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,towards the cottage. Pierrette--in consequence perhaps of what I had
6658,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,just said--stood his ground boldly; at least for the moment.
6659,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,
6660,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"""For my part I thought of nothing but myself, and rushed screaming into"

6662,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"cries, and could himself see the terrible ghost at a distance. He at"

6664,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"believe, had figured in Napoleon's campaigns--and hastily loading it"
6665,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"with deer-shot, marched out in the direction of the phantom. Walking a"
6666,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,"few steps, he called out in a voice which he strove in vain to make"

6680,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS.--TIGER.,And I regret to say my nurse's husband fled--positively fled; caught his

6825,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"by other miracles, but He could have cured the man by a word, or the"
6826,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,mere exercise of His will; yet on this occasion He chose to touch the
6827,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"man's eyes and his tongue, and to sigh a mental prayer to His Father."
6828,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,
6829,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,His reasons for taking the man aside from the multitude we can more
6830,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"easily surmise. It may have been as a lesson to His disciples, to teach"
6831,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,them that they should not make a vain display of their works of mercy;
6832,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"or it may have been that, not wishing to excite still further at the"
6833,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"moment the enmity of the Pharisees, He desired that the fame of His"
6834,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,miracles should not be further spread. But whatever our Saviour's motive
6835,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"in taking the man aside, it is evident that the multitude crowded about"
6836,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"Him, and beheld the miracle; for St. Mark goes on to say:--"
6837,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,
6838,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"""And He charged them that they should tell no man; but the more He"
6839,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; and were"
6840,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"beyond measure astonished, saying, 'He hath done all things well: He"
6841,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"maketh the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.'"""
6842,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,
6843,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"The Scripture tells us that, after Jesus had performed this miracle,"
6844,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"great multitudes came unto Him, bringing with them those that were lame,"
6845,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"blind, dumb, or maimed. These poor suffering creatures were cast down at"
6846,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"Jesus' feet, and He healed them. ""And the people wondered when they saw"
6847,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the"
6848,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"blind to see; and they glorified the God of Israel."""
6849,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,
6850,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"Christ performed a great many more miracles, my children, than I shall"
6851,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"be able to tell you about, and you must read of them for yourselves in"
6852,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,the Bible when you grow a little older. Most of our Saviour's miracles
6853,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"were, as I have before told you, miracles of healing, and works of"
6854,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"mercy; but, on one occasion about this time, He performed a miracle to"
6855,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,pay what was called the tribute money.
6856,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,
6857,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,This tribute was a tax levied for the support of the temple at
6858,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,Jerusalem. It consisted in the annual payment of a coin called a
6859,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,dedrachma--two drachmas--by every person over twenty years of age. It
6860,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,was devoted chiefly to the purchase of such things as were used for the
6861,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"sacrifices in the Jewish sanctuary. This tax was sometimes called ""The"
6862,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"ransom money, or atonement for the soul,"" and was paid equally by rich"
6863,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"and poor, to show that the souls of all were considered to be equal in"
6864,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"the sight of God. It was an acknowledgment that all were sinners, and"
6865,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,all alike needed to be ransomed.
6866,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,
6867,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,We are told by St. Matthew that when Jesus and His disciples came to
6868,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"Capernaum, ""They that received tribute money, came to Peter, and said,"
6869,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"Doth not your master pay tribute?"""
6870,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,
6871,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"Peter, who had heard our Lord teach His followers to give to all their"
6872,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"dues, answered promptly to the inquiry, ""Yes,"" and then went into the"
6873,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"house where Jesus was. Our Saviour, although not present at the"
6874,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"conversation with the collector of tribute, knew perfectly well what had"
6875,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"taken place, and He anticipated what Peter was about to tell Him by"
6876,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"saying,--"
6877,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,
6878,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"""What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take"
6879,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"custom or tribute? of their own children or of strangers?"""
6880,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,
6881,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"Peter, you must know, was sometimes addressed by his first name of"
6882,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"Simon. Now Christ, in putting this question to him, meant to ask whether"
6883,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"He, as the Son of God, to whom the temple was dedicated, ought to pay"
6884,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"tribute for its support, as kings do not tax their children."
6885,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"Nevertheless, He added words signifying that lest the Pharisees should"
6886,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"charge Him with despising the temple and its services, the tribute"
6887,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"should be paid. And He went on: ""Go thou to the sea, and cast an hook,"
6888,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his
6889,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them"
6890,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"for me and thee."""
6891,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,
6892,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,"Peter obeyed. He went and caught the fish, found in its mouth a"
6893,CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.,shekel--equal to four drachmas--and with it paid the tribute.

6908,MARGARET.,
6909,MARGARET.,The little friend that you see in the picture is a little girl that I
6910,MARGARET.,"knew long ago. As you can judge from the picture, her father and mother"
6911,MARGARET.,were not what we call gentlefolk. But simple country people as
6912,MARGARET.,"Margaret's parents were, they had as warm hearts--yes, and as good"
6913,MARGARET.,manners too--as you would meet with anywhere.
6914,MARGARET.,
6915,MARGARET.,"Margaret's father was just an honest English farmer, and her mother a"
6916,MARGARET.,"worthy active farmer's wife, while little Margaret herself was the"
6917,MARGARET.,perfection of a merry country girl. She was up early to help her mother
6918,MARGARET.,"in the morning. She would rise at cock-crow, wash and dress herself,"
6919,MARGARET.,"make her own bed, and then kneel down, as we see her in the picture, and"
6920,MARGARET.,"say her prayers. And if it was summer, the sun, in rising would cast his"
6921,MARGARET.,"slanting rays in at the window, and gild her pretty head the while with"
6922,MARGARET.,his soft light.
6923,MARGARET.,
6924,MARGARET.,"I had been very ill, and went down to stay at the farm to get strong and"
6925,MARGARET.,well again. In fact I took a lodging there for a short time. But I
6926,MARGARET.,"already knew the people, for I had once lived in the neighbourhood. It"
6927,MARGARET.,"was the month of October when I went down, after having been long"
6928,MARGARET.,confined to my sick room in London; and I can remember now how beautiful
6929,MARGARET.,"the woods looked, as I drove from the station up the hill to the"
6930,MARGARET.,farm-house. The leaves of the oak were already mellowing into bronze;
6931,MARGARET.,the beeches were changing to a deep orange; and here and there the pale
6932,MARGARET.,yellow of the chestnut showed in relief against the dark green of the
6933,MARGARET.,unchanging fir. The whole landscape glowed in the warm lights and
6934,MARGARET.,shadows of autumn colouring.
6935,MARGARET.,
6936,MARGARET.,The old farm-house was perfect in point of cleanliness and comfort. I
6937,MARGARET.,"soon regained my health and strength, and was beginning to think of"
6938,MARGARET.,"returning home again, when the sad event happened which I am going to"
6939,MARGARET.,tell you of.
6940,MARGARET.,
6941,MARGARET.,"Little Margaret used to wander in and out, and round about, near her"
6942,MARGARET.,"father's farm, just as she pleased. She was known and loved by everyone,"
6943,MARGARET.,"great and small; by the young children particularly, who would run out"
6944,MARGARET.,of their cottages as she passed to see and speak to her. One evening she
6945,MARGARET.,"was returning home across a plot of open ground near the farm, when she"
6946,MARGARET.,"saw, drawn up out of the road, one of those houses on wheels which"
6947,MARGARET.,gipsies travel about in. A woman stood outside with a little brown baby
6948,MARGARET.,in her arms; and Margaret could not pass without saying a word to the
6949,MARGARET.,baby.
6950,MARGARET.,
6951,MARGARET.,"""But it doesn't look well,"" said Margaret to the mother."
6952,MARGARET.,
6953,MARGARET.,"""No, missie, nor 'tain't well neither,"" replied the woman; ""and I have"
6954,MARGARET.,one inside a deal worser. I don't know what ails 'em. Would yer like to
6955,MARGARET.,"step inside and see the child?"""
6956,MARGARET.,
6957,MARGARET.,"Margaret ran up the steps without a moment's hesitation, and found a"
6958,MARGARET.,"poor sick boy about seven years old stretched upon a hard mattress,"
6959,MARGARET.,tossing from side to side in what was evidently a bad fever. The
6960,MARGARET.,"good-hearted child said to the woman,--""I am sure your little boy is"
6961,MARGARET.,very ill; I will run home and ask mother what you had better do for
6962,MARGARET.,"him."""
6963,MARGARET.,
6964,MARGARET.,"She hurried home full of the subject, and I was sitting in the garden"
6965,MARGARET.,"when she came running in. I asked the reason of her haste, when she told"
6966,MARGARET.,"me of the sick children. From her description, the idea at once occurred"
6967,MARGARET.,"to me that they were sick with scarlet fever; and the parish doctor,"
6968,MARGARET.,"whom we asked to go to see them, afterwards confirmed my opinion."
6969,MARGARET.,
6970,MARGARET.,"Those children, however, struggled through the terrible illness; but,"
6971,MARGARET.,alas! our little Margaret--I say _our_ because a strong love had grown
6972,MARGARET.,"up in my heart for the good and pretty child--sickened with the fever,"
6973,MARGARET.,which she had caught during those few minutes spent in the
6974,MARGARET.,fever-stricken cart. Days of wearing anxiety and nights of watching
6975,MARGARET.,followed. It was heart-breaking to see the little head rolling from side
6976,MARGARET.,"to side upon the pillow, while the pretty eyes looked with unmeaning"
6977,MARGARET.,"gaze upon us all: the voice too, that we had so loved to hear, sounded"
6978,MARGARET.,strange as it talked in the wild delirium of fever.
6979,MARGARET.,
6980,MARGARET.,"After a time the fever abated, and the child became more tranquil,"
6981,MARGARET.,though weaker. One day some sad words fell from the little parched lips:
6982,MARGARET.,"""Mother dear,"" she said, ""set me up a little; I want to see out of the"
6983,MARGARET.,"window, and say good-bye to everything."""
6984,MARGARET.,
6985,MARGARET.,"The poor mother raised her up, and Margaret could see the soft evening"
6986,MARGARET.,"sky, and the outside world just melting into twilight under the warm"
6987,MARGARET.,smile of the setting sun.
6988,MARGARET.,
6989,MARGARET.,"""Is it, as they say, mother, more beautiful there?"" she whispered,"
6990,MARGARET.,pointing to the sky.
6991,MARGARET.,
6992,MARGARET.,"""Where, darling?"" asked her mother."
6993,MARGARET.,
6994,MARGARET.,"""In heaven,"" said the child, ""which I shall see so soon."""
6995,MARGARET.,
6996,MARGARET.,"""Not soon! Oh, my darling, not soon! don't say it!"" cried the poor"
6997,MARGARET.,farmer's wife.
6998,MARGARET.,
6999,MARGARET.,"""Yes, very soon. Don't cry, mother dear."""
7000,MARGARET.,
7001,MARGARET.,"And Margaret was right. Only a few days more, and the setting sun shed"
7002,MARGARET.,its warm light upon her grave.
7003,MARGARET.,
7004,MARGARET.,"This is a very, very sad story; and perhaps has brought tears into the"
7005,MARGARET.,eyes of some of my dear little readers. I hardly know why I have told
7006,MARGARET.,"it, except that my stories would not be like reality, if they were"
7007,MARGARET.,always happy. The world has shadows as well as sunshine.

7188,IN EIGHT SCENES.,
7189,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"A pretty little girl is Tiny, and she is also _now_ a very nice one, but"
7190,IN EIGHT SCENES.,she used to have one great fault--she was very conceited. She fancied
7191,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"herself the prettiest and cleverest child in the world, and when she was"
7192,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"with other little girls of the village where she lived, she was in the"
7193,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"habit of telling them very plainly what she thought of herself; which,"
7194,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"you may imagine, was not the way to make them like her. One day she had"
7195,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"a lesson, however, which, I am glad to say, quite cured her; and I am"
7196,IN EIGHT SCENES.,going to tell you how the happy change was brought about.
7197,IN EIGHT SCENES.,
7198,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"That little girl you see in the picture, standing on the other side of"
7199,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"the brook, is Tiny. This brook is in a little wood close to her mother's"
7200,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"cottage, and she has just been looking at the reflection of her own"
7201,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"pretty face in the water, and thinking how much prettier it is than any"
7202,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"other faces she ever sees. While she is occupied in this way, she hears"
7203,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"somebody laugh, and looking up, sees a beautiful lady and an ugly little"
7204,IN EIGHT SCENES.,dwarf standing on the other side of the brook. The lady has bright wings
7205,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"upon her shoulders, and both she and the dwarf are laughing at poor"
7206,IN EIGHT SCENES.,little Tiny.
7207,IN EIGHT SCENES.,
7208,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"Tiny does not quite like being laughed at, but has no doubt they are"
7209,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"admiring her all the same. She is very much astonished, though; when she"
7210,IN EIGHT SCENES.,hears the lady say:--
7211,IN EIGHT SCENES.,
7212,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"[Illustration: Child, lady, and dwarf]"
7213,IN EIGHT SCENES.,
7214,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"""Well, Tiny, I suppose you think yourself quite perfect. You are a vain"
7215,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"little creature; and if you remain through life the same, nobody will"
7216,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"love you, and you will never be happy: I will help you to become wiser."
7217,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"I am going to give you a pair of wings, with which you will be able to"
7218,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"fly about, and see and hear a great deal which will serve as a useful"
7219,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"lesson to you. The wings will only last till sunset, but you will have"
7220,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"time to find out that there is vanity in others as well as yourself, and"
7221,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"to judge how silly it is."""
7222,IN EIGHT SCENES.,
7223,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"After saying this, the fairy with her attendant dwarf disappear. But"
7224,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"Tiny feels a strange pricking at her shoulders, and presently finds"
7225,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"herself raised up from the ground by a pair of wings, which have grown"
7226,IN EIGHT SCENES.,out suddenly. She was always small for her age; and that is the reason
7227,IN EIGHT SCENES.,she is called Tiny; but now she discovers that she has become no bigger
7228,IN EIGHT SCENES.,than a little bird.

7237,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"says, for he cannot see well in the daylight. ""Please, sir, I'm a little"
7238,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"girl, only a good fairy has given me wings, that I may see the world,"
7239,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"and grow wiser."" ""Ha, ha, ha!"" laughs the owl, ""see the world indeed!"

7269,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"the water, exclaims, ""Stop that horrid noise! I can't get my little ones"
7270,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"to sleep."" ""Don't bother me about your little ones,"" says the frog; ""and"
7271,IN EIGHT SCENES.,why don't you come out of the water if you've anything to say? But
7272,IN EIGHT SCENES.,you've no legs: you've nothing to stand upon: you are an imperfect

7283,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"among some cabbages a pert young hare. ""Did you call?"" he inquires."
7284,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"""You!"" says the cat contemptuously, ""are you Puss?"" ""Yes, indeed, I am"
7285,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"called Puss by a great many people."" ""Why, where is your tail, if you"

7299,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"quarrelling like all the rest. The toucan is mocking the ostrich,"
7300,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"because, with all its feathers, it cannot fly; and the ostrich laughs at"
7301,IN EIGHT SCENES.,the toucan for its enormous beak.
7302,IN EIGHT SCENES.,
7303,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"""I wish they wouldn't all find fault with each other so much,"" Tiny"

7314,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"and an eagle. ""A nice cool breeze here!"" says the penguin to Tiny, as he"
7315,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"flaps his little wings, which look like leather. ""Don't waste your time"
7316,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"in such company, little girl,"" says the eagle; ""that half-bird,"
7317,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"half-fish is a disgrace to the family of birds, of which I am king."" ""I"
7318,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"may be humble and ugly,"" rejoins the penguin, ""but he is a bird of prey,"

7328,IN EIGHT SCENES.,
7329,IN EIGHT SCENES.,Tiny remembers now that the fairy had said her wings would last only
7330,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"till sunset, so she thinks it is time to fly towards home; for the sun"
7331,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"is getting low already. You see, they are fairy wings, so she can fly"
7332,IN EIGHT SCENES.,just as fast as she pleases; and in a few minutes she alights in the
7333,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"wood, near the spot she had started from."
7334,IN EIGHT SCENES.,
7335,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"The first thing she sees, close to her in the long grass, is a handsome"
7336,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"grasshopper. ""How d'ye do, dear?"" chirps he. ""I am very glad to see you,"
7337,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"for I am bored to death with the conversation of this stupid mole."" As"
7338,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"he speaks, he points out to Tiny the mole's nose just peeping out of a"
7339,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"molehill. ""You see,"" he continues, ""instead of being like me, instead of"
7340,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"having bright sparkling eyes, and wearing a splendid green coat, all"
7341,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"over gold, he is a very poor creature, with scarcely any eyes at all;"
7342,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"and he spends his time almost always under ground, so of course he knows"
7343,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"nothing, and is very dull company."" ""What good do _you_ do, with your"
7344,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"green coat and gilding?"" replies the mole. ""You do nothing but chirp,"
7345,IN EIGHT SCENES.,while I devour the vermin that would eat up the roots of the corn. So
7346,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"that, although buried, I am useful to others."""
7347,IN EIGHT SCENES.,
7348,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"""Certainly the mole has the best of the argument there,"" thinks Tiny. At"
7349,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"that moment the sun goes down: Tiny's wings drop off on to the ground,"
7350,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"and at once shrivel up and disappear; she recovers, too, her natural"
7351,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"size. Then she sees her mother's cottage through the trees, and a candle"
7352,IN EIGHT SCENES.,just lighted is burning in the window.
7353,IN EIGHT SCENES.,
7354,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"As she walks towards it, she talks to herself as if she were somebody"
7355,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"else. ""Now, Miss Tiny,"" she begins, and she touches her own breast with"
7356,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"the point of her finger as she speaks,--""now, Miss Tiny, let us think a"
7357,IN EIGHT SCENES.,little. The good fairy told you you should learn a lesson and grow wise.
7358,IN EIGHT SCENES.,Let us see what you have learnt. All these creatures are more or less
7359,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"conceited, and, just because they are so, they are always quarrelling;"
7360,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"and how disagreeable and ridiculous they make themselves, to be sure! I"
7361,IN EIGHT SCENES.,wonder if Miss Tiny is as disagreeable and absurd as they are? If she
7362,IN EIGHT SCENES.,"is, she won't be so any more. From this day, she will always try to see"

7516,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,
7517,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"One of the most common faults--or rather, I should say, one of the most"
7518,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"common sins--that we meet with in the world, is that of ingratitude."
7519,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"Some are ungrateful from pride or conceit, thinking that the kindnesses"
7520,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,or services of others are due to them of right. But most people are
7521,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,ungrateful simply from thoughtlessness: yet this very
7522,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,thoughtlessness--the want of thought for others--has its root in what is
7523,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,the foundation of all faults--selfishness.
7524,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,
7525,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"Even in dumb creatures--from whom, by the way, we may often learn good"
7526,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,lessons--we seldom see ingratitude. If you are kind and gentle to a dog
7527,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"or cat, a horse or bird, it will be thankful, and generally manage in"
7528,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,its own fashion to make you understand its gratitude. My darling
7529,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"children, never be ungrateful! Be grateful to God first of all--be"
7530,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,grateful to God for everything. Be grateful to your father and mother;
7531,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,and be grateful also to all those who show so many kindnesses to you.
7532,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,Never forget to thank them both with heart and lip.
7533,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,
7534,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,I am going to tell you to-day of an instance of man's ingratitude: not
7535,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"that of man to man, but of ingratitude to our Lord Jesus Christ."
7536,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,
7537,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"We are told by St. Luke that,--""It came to pass as Jesus went to"
7538,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"Jerusalem, He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. And as He"
7539,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"entered into a certain village, there met Him ten men that were lepers,"
7540,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"which stood afar off; and they lifted up their voices, and said, 'Jesus,"
7541,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"Master, have mercy on us.' And when He saw them, He said unto them, 'Go,"
7542,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"show yourselves unto the priests.' And it came to pass that, as they"
7543,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"went, they were cleansed."""
7544,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,
7545,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"I must tell you that this leprosy, with which these poor people were"
7546,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"afflicted, was a terrible disease common among the Jews at that time. It"
7547,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"was a disease of the skin, which was hereditary, and also was caught by"
7548,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,contagion. Hence those afflicted with it were prohibited by strict laws
7549,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,from associating with other people. They might not enter the walled
7550,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"cities at all, and in the villages they were obliged to live apart from"
7551,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"the other inhabitants. You see these lepers ""stood afar off"" while they"
7552,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,cried out to Jesus for mercy.
7553,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,
7554,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,We must suppose that before anyone recovering from the leprosy was
7555,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"allowed to associate with his fellow-citizens, he had to go before the"
7556,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"priests, that they should pronounce him cured; and this explains the"
7557,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"injunction of our Saviour--""Go, show yourselves to the priests."" The"
7558,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"lepers had faith, and turned at once to obey. They had scarcely moved a"
7559,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,step when the change in their condition seems to have taken place; and
7560,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"we may imagine their joy and surprise, on looking at each other, to see"
7561,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,the ghastly and loathsome hue of the leprous skin change for the bloom
7562,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,and freshness of health. But now we come to the sad instance of
7563,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,ingratitude.
7564,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,
7565,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"St. Luke goes on to tell us--still speaking of the lepers:--""And one of"
7566,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice"
7567,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"glorified God; and fell down on his face at Jesus' feet, giving Him"
7568,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"thanks."""
7569,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,
7570,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"Thus we find, out of these ten, one only showed himself grateful, and"
7571,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"thought, before aught else, of glorifying God, and giving thanks to"
7572,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"Jesus. The other nine, in their joy at the blessing which had just been"
7573,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"bestowed upon them, forgot the Bestower of that blessing. They hastened"
7574,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"on, thinking only of their own good fortune, and eager to make known"
7575,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"their recovery to the priests, that they might be restored to"
7576,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,communication with their fellow men.
7577,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,
7578,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"Our Saviour only remarked upon this instance of ingratitude:--""Were"
7579,TEN LEPERS HEALED.,"there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?"""

7594,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7595,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,I made the acquaintance of my little friend Charlie under very unusual
7596,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,and startling circumstances. When I saw him for the first time he was
7597,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,situated as you see him in the picture. I saw a lad about thirteen years
7598,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"of age, clinging desperately, for very life, to the topmast of a sunken"
7599,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,ship in the British Channel. I will tell you how it happened.
7600,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7601,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"I must go back nearly twenty years;--indeed, I ought to explain that"
7602,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,Charlie was a little friend of mine a long time ago; now he's a grown-up
7603,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"man. Well, twenty years ago I was not very old myself; but my sister,"
7604,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"who is some years older than I am, was already married, and her husband"
7605,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"was very fond of yachting. They lived, during a great part of the year,"
7606,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"in the Isle of Wight, and there I often used to go to stay with them."
7607,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7608,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"The ""Swallow""--that was the name of my brother-in-law's yacht--was a"
7609,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"beautiful boat, and many happy hours have I passed on board her, as she"
7610,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"skimmed merrily over the sparkling water. I delighted to sit on deck,"
7611,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,watching the fishing-boats as they rode bravely from wave to wave; or
7612,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"sometimes wondering at some large ship, as it passed by, on which men"
7613,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,live for weeks and months without ever touching land. We used to sail
7614,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"long distances, and occasionally be out for several days and nights"
7615,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,together. My brother-in-law's skipper could tell me what country almost
7616,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,every vessel that we saw was bound for. Some were sailing to climates
7617,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,where the heat is so great that our most sultry summer in England is
7618,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"comparatively cold; others were off northward, perhaps whale-fishing,"
7619,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"where they would see huge icebergs, and hear the growling of the polar"
7620,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,bears.
7621,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7622,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,We were taking our last cruise of the season: it was already near the
7623,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"end of October, and the weather was becoming stormy. Passing out of the"
7624,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"Solent into the Channel, we found the sea much rougher than we expected;"
7625,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"and as night came on it blew a regular gale. The wind and sea roared,"
7626,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"the rain poured down in torrents, and the night seemed to me to be the"
7627,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"darkest I had ever known. But on board the ""Swallow"" we had no fear; we"
7628,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"trusted to the seamanship of our skipper and the goodness of our vessel,"
7629,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,and went to bed with minds as free from fear as if the sea were smooth
7630,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,and the sky clear.
7631,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7632,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"I awoke just as dawn was breaking, dressed quickly, and throwing a"
7633,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"water-proof cloak over me, popped my head up the companion-ladder to see"
7634,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,how things looked. The old skipper was on deck; he had not turned in
7635,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"during the night. I wished him good-morning, and he remarked, in return,"
7636,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"that the wind was going down, he thought. Looking at the sea, I observed"
7637,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"two or three large fragments of wood floating near, and they attracted"
7638,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,his notice at the same moment.
7639,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7640,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"""Has there been a wreck, captain?"" I asked, with a feeling of awe."
7641,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7642,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"""That's about what it is, miss,"" answered the old seaman."
7643,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7644,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"""Do you think the people are drowned?"" I inquired anxiously."
7645,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7646,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"""Well,"" replied Captain Bounce, casting, as I thought, rather a"
7647,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"contemptuous glance at me, ""people don't in general live under water,"
7648,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"miss."""
7649,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7650,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"""Perhaps they may have had boats,"" I said meekly. ""Do you think boats"
7651,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"could have reached the shore in such a storm?"""
7652,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7653,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"""Well,"" answered the old captain, ""they might have had boats and they"
7654,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"mightn't; and the boats, supposing they had 'em, might have lived"
7655,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"through the storm, and at the same time they mightn't."""
7656,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7657,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"This was not giving me much information, and I thought to myself that my"
7658,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,friend the skipper did not seem so much inclined for a chat as usual; I
7659,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"turned to look at the sea in search of more pieces of wreck, when I"
7660,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"discovered, in the distance, a dark speck rising out of the water. I"
7661,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"pointed it out to the skipper at once, who took his glass out of his"
7662,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"pocket, and, after looking through it for a moment, exclaimed,--"
7663,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7664,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"""There's something floating there, and a man clinging to it, as I'm"
7665,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"alive!"""
7666,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7667,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"As he spoke, my brother-in-law came on deck, and also took a look"
7668,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"through the telescope. Then he, the captain, and every sailor on board"
7669,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,became eager and excited; you would have thought it was some dear friend
7670,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,of each whose life was to be saved. The yacht was headed in the
7671,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"direction of the object, the boat was quickly lowered, the captain"
7672,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"himself, with four sailors, jumping into it; and, in another minute,"
7673,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"they caught in their arms a poor little exhausted and fainting boy, as"
7674,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,he dropped from the mast of a large sunken ship. We could now
7675,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,distinguish the tops of all the three masts appearing above the waves;
7676,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"for the sea was not deep, and the ship had settled down in an upright"
7677,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,position.
7678,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7679,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"Poor Charlie Standish was soon in the cabin of the yacht, and after"
7680,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,swallowing some champagne he revived sufficiently to tell us his story.
7681,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"The sunken ship was the ""Melbourne,"" bound for Australia, and this was"
7682,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,Charlie's first voyage as a midshipman on board. During the darkness of
7683,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,the night she had been run into by a large homeward-bound merchantman of
7684,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,the same class. She sank within an hour of the collision. In the
7685,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,scramble for the boats Charlie thought he had but little chance for
7686,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"finding a place; and as the ship filled, and kept sinking deeper in the"
7687,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"water, an instinct of self-preservation led him to climb into the"
7688,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"rigging. Then up he went, higher and higher, even to the topmast; and at"
7689,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"last, when the vessel went down all at once, he found himself, to his"
7690,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"inexpressible relief, still above the surface."
7691,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
7692,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,What most astonished us all was that a boy so young should have been
7693,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"able to hold on for more than an hour to a slippery mast, exposed to the"
7694,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"fury of the wind, and within reach, even, of the lashing waves. We"
7695,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"sailed home at once to the Isle of Wight, and wrote to the boy's mother,"
7696,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"a widow living in London, to tell her of his safety. The boy himself"
7697,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,stayed with us two or three days. My brother-in-law took a great fancy
7698,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"to him; he has watched his career, and seen him at intervals, ever"
7699,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,since. Charlie Standish is now a chief mate on board a great merchantman
7700,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"of the same class as the ""Melbourne."""

7745,LIONS.,
7746,LIONS.,"The Lion is called the king of beasts, because he is the most"
7747,LIONS.,"courageous, the strongest, and the grandest-looking of all beasts. The"
7748,LIONS.,picture represents a great lion and his family; you see he has just
7749,LIONS.,"caught a poor little gazelle, of which herds are found in the plains of"
7750,LIONS.,"Africa. And that, as I daresay you know, is also the country of the"
7751,LIONS.,lions.
7752,LIONS.,
7753,LIONS.,"Lions belong to what is called the cat tribe of animals, as do also"
7754,LIONS.,tigers and leopards. The members of this tribe are remarkable for their
7755,LIONS.,"powerful jaw, large fangs, the quickness and grace of their movements,"
7756,LIONS.,and for the manner in which the sharp hooked claws of the feet are drawn
7757,LIONS.,"back when not in use, and thrust forward when needed for action."
7758,LIONS.,
7759,LIONS.,"The colour of the lion is a tawny yellow, lighter on the under parts of"
7760,LIONS.,"the body, and darker above. The ears are almost black, and there is a"
7761,LIONS.,"tuft of black hair at the tip of the tail. When full-grown, the male"
7762,LIONS.,"lion has a thick, shaggy mane of long hair, which falls from the neck"
7763,LIONS.,"and shoulders, covering the throat and breast. He measures some four"
7764,LIONS.,"feet in height at the shoulder, and about eleven feet in length,"
7765,LIONS.,"including the tail. These measurements, however, are only applicable to"
7766,LIONS.,"the animals which have lived in freedom in their native land, with their"
7767,LIONS.,"limbs unshackled, and spirits unbroken."
7768,LIONS.,
7769,LIONS.,"The lioness is a smaller animal than her mate, the difference in size"
7770,LIONS.,"appearing greater than it really is, because she is without the shaggy"
7771,LIONS.,"mane, which makes the lion seem so grand and imposing. But though"
7772,LIONS.,"smaller, she is quite as terrible as the lion; and if she has cubs to"
7773,LIONS.,"look after and protect, she is a fearful enemy to any who cross her"
7774,LIONS.,path.
7775,LIONS.,
7776,LIONS.,"I think it would amuse you to hear an anecdote of a revengeful lioness,"
7777,LIONS.,"which I lately read. The gentleman, who relates the story, was out with"
7778,LIONS.,"a party of hunters in Southern Africa, in search of elephants. They had"
7779,LIONS.,"not had much sport, and as they were going to encamp for a day, this"
7780,LIONS.,gentleman thought he would ride off alone to a patch of jungle or wood
7781,LIONS.,"not far away, which appeared likely to harbour wild beasts. He"
7782,LIONS.,"discovered no sign of elephants, but he found a new footprint made by a"
7783,LIONS.,"lion. Now he had never shot a lion, and had a great ambition to do so;"
7784,LIONS.,"accordingly, he followed the lion's track, which of course was very"
7785,LIONS.,"brave of him, but, I must say, I think, very rash. After a little while"
7786,LIONS.,"he came suddenly upon the savage beast, and luckily shot him dead at the"
7787,LIONS.,first shot.
7788,LIONS.,
7789,LIONS.,"Having achieved this exploit, he was anxious to carry back the skin with"
7790,LIONS.,"him as a trophy; and therefore set to work to skin the dead beast,"
7791,LIONS.,"which, it seems to me, must have been a most horrible business. This"
7792,LIONS.,"operation took a long time, and when accomplished, our friend the hunter"
7793,LIONS.,found great difficulty in persuading his horse to carry the skin. Horses
7794,LIONS.,"have a great horror of lions, and the poor animal probably did not feel"
7795,LIONS.,sure that the skin alone could do him no harm.
7796,LIONS.,
7797,LIONS.,"At last all was satisfactorily arranged, and the hunter started to"
7798,LIONS.,"return to the encampment; but so much time had been lost, that before he"
7799,LIONS.,"had gone far, night began to close in, and he thought it best to bivouac"
7800,LIONS.,where he was till daylight. There was a stream of water close by; and he
7801,LIONS.,"had with him a blanket, a flask of brandy, and a box of matches. He took"
7802,LIONS.,"the precaution also, before it was quite dark, to shoot a guinea-fowl"
7803,LIONS.,"for his supper. Then, collecting a quantity of dry wood, he piled it up"
7804,LIONS.,"in a circle, leaving space enough inside for himself, his horse, and the"
7805,LIONS.,"skin. Setting fire to the wood, he considered himself safe from any"
7806,LIONS.,"attack of wild beasts within this magic circle of fire, and made himself"
7807,LIONS.,"comfortable for the night. He cooked and ate his supper, and then, lying"
7808,LIONS.,"down by the side of his horse, soon began to doze."
7809,LIONS.,
7810,LIONS.,"Presently he was disturbed by a loud snort from his horse. He rose up,"
7811,LIONS.,"and kicking the burning wood together with the heel of his boot, made a"
7812,LIONS.,"brighter blaze, and distinctly saw the head of an old lioness looking"
7813,LIONS.,"through the surrounding bushes. She was gone in an instant, but you may"
7814,LIONS.,be sure the hunter did not go to sleep again. He suspected at once that
7815,LIONS.,"she was the widow of the lion he had killed, and that she had followed"
7816,LIONS.,the scent of his skin to be revenged upon his murderer.
7817,LIONS.,
7818,LIONS.,"Our hunter made his fire burn as brightly as he could, and remained upon"
7819,LIONS.,the watch for the lioness. He thought he could see her again among the
7820,LIONS.,"bushes, and seizing a piece of burning wood, threw it at her; then he"
7821,LIONS.,"detected her slinking away into the darkness. He did not fire, for he"
7822,LIONS.,saw too imperfectly to be sure of his aim. Not long afterwards he
7823,LIONS.,"suddenly heard a terrific roar, and at the same moment some large body"
7824,LIONS.,"flew through the air close to him. Then followed a crash, and the hunter"
7825,LIONS.,"saw his poor horse knocked down, as if shot, beneath the weight of the"
7826,LIONS.,"lioness, who stood on him, tearing at him and growling. The hunter"
7827,LIONS.,"fired: the first shot wounded her, the second killed; but she had so far"
7828,LIONS.,revenged the lion's death that she had killed the horse.
7829,LIONS.,
7830,LIONS.,"The hunter now had her skin as well as the lion's, which must have been"
7831,LIONS.,"a satisfaction to him. He set to work to skin her at once, and then"
7832,LIONS.,buried both skins in the ground that they might not be eaten or damaged
7833,LIONS.,"by prowling animals, while he trudged back on foot to the encampment. In"
7834,LIONS.,"the afternoon he returned in a waggon, and fetched away both skins,"
7835,LIONS.,which he kept as trophies.

7837,LIONS.,"My own experience of a lioness is of a very different sort to this, as"
7838,LIONS.,my acquaintance with either lions or lionesses has been made only at the
7839,LIONS.,Zoological gardens. But I remember a few years ago there was a dear old
7840,LIONS.,"lioness there, who had five little cubs; and I can only say her kindness"
7841,LIONS.,and tenderness to her young ones would have afforded a good example to
7842,LIONS.,many mothers.
7843,LIONS.,
7844,LIONS.,I will tell you another anecdote about a lion. It is related of a lion
7845,LIONS.,"of the Zoological gardens, who died there of inflammation of the lungs"
7846,LIONS.,many years ago. Sir Edwin Landseer was then just rising into fame as a
7847,LIONS.,"painter of animals, and a friend of his suggested to the manager of the"
7848,LIONS.,"gardens, that the dead lion should be sent to Sir Edwin, in case he"
7849,LIONS.,might like to paint it.
7850,LIONS.,
7851,LIONS.,"So one morning, just at daylight, (this is how the story is told) the"
7852,LIONS.,artist was awakened by a knocking at his bedroom door. He called out to
7853,LIONS.,know who was there.
7854,LIONS.,
7855,LIONS.,"""Please, sir,"" was the reply, ""have you ordered a lion?"""
7856,LIONS.,
7857,LIONS.,"""Ordered a what?"""
7858,LIONS.,
7859,LIONS.,"""A lion, sir; have you ordered a lion? because there's a dead one just"
7860,LIONS.,"come to the door."""
7861,LIONS.,
7862,LIONS.,"""Oh, very well,"" said the great painter, ""take him in: I'll be down"
7863,LIONS.,"directly."""
7864,LIONS.,
7865,LIONS.,"Dressing hurriedly, he went downstairs, and beheld the enormous beast"
7866,LIONS.,stretched at full length upon the floor of his studio. The artist
7867,LIONS.,"quickly arranged his palette, and painted a picture of a lion lying dead"
7868,LIONS.,"in the desert. The picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1849,"
7869,LIONS.,and added greatly to the artist's fame.

7943,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,they must fancy Aunt Totty seated in the midst of her little nephews and
7944,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"nieces, who are all ready to listen. This is how she begins:--"
7945,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
7946,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""Now, my dears, I am going to give you an account of a pet I had whose"
7947,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,name was Jacquot. I daresay you think from the name it must have been a
7948,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"monkey or a parrot. No such thing! it was a great brown bear, and this"
7949,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,is how I made his acquaintance.
7950,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
7951,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""I was not more than nine years old, and was travelling with my papa and"
7952,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"mamma, and my brother, who was two or three years older than myself. We"
7953,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"were making a tour in Switzerland, and stopped for a few days at a town"
7954,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,of which I forget the name now; for you may suppose it was a great many
7955,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"years ago. However, what I _do_ remember is that a fair was being held"
7956,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"in the town at the time, and that is how it happened that the bear was"
7957,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,there.
7958,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
7959,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""On the morning after our arrival I came down early,--as I thought,"
7960,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,before anyone else of the party--and seated myself at the open window of
7961,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,our sitting-room in the hotel. As I sat there watching all that was
7962,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"going on outside, I saw my brother cross the courtyard of the hotel,"
7963,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,coming out from a long low range of buildings on the other side of it. A
7964,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"minute afterwards he entered the room, and coming up to me, said with an"
7965,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"air of mystery,--'Totty, I want to show you something: come with me"
7966,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,before mamma and papa are down; you'll see something curious.'
7967,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
7968,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""'What is it?' I inquired, feeling quite excited."
7969,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
7970,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""'I won't tell you what it is; but come along and see,' answered my"
7971,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,brother.
7972,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
7973,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""As he spoke, he led me downstairs. We crossed the courtyard hand in"
7974,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"hand, and entered the stables of the hotel. I could not help looking"
7975,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"about rather nervously, as he led me past a number of horses and"
7976,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"mules--keeping always, however, at a safe distance from their"
7977,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"heels--till we came to the last stall of all. In a corner of this, I"
7978,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"perceived a huge ragged hairy ball, but what it was I could not at first"
7979,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,imagine. I saw that a strong chain attached it to a ring in the wall;
7980,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"then I discovered that it was some living creature, for its sides rose"
7981,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"and fell with the breath as it slept. A man, who was lying on some straw"
7982,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"close by, seeing my brother and me, rose up, and said in French,--'You"
7983,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"need not be afraid, he won't hurt you.' Then patting the creature with"
7984,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"his hand, he added,--'You wouldn't hurt the young lady, would you,"
7985,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,Jacquot?'
7986,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
7987,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""The ball uncurled itself, growled, and rose upon four legs. It was a"
7988,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"bear: but the saddest-looking, the thinnest, and most ragged you can"
7989,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"imagine. It had twenty scars on different parts of its body, and one ear"
7990,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"was almost torn away. I must have looked shocked and distressed, for the"
7991,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"man seemed to understand my thoughts, and said,--'Ah, well! what can you"
7992,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,expect? poor Jacquot is not happy.'
7993,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
7994,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""Then he went on to tell us the bear's history. It appeared that he was"
7995,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"himself only the keeper or attendant of the bear, not the owner. He told"
7996,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,us that Jacquot was born in the Pyrènean mountains: he was caught when
7997,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"quite a baby, and received an excellent education, being able to dance"
7998,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,and perform every trick a bear can learn; he was perfect also in point
7999,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"of docility. At one year of age, his education being considered"
8000,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"complete, he had been sold to the man who was still his master. This"
8001,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"man, at the time he made the purchase, was the owner also of other"
8002,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"animals. Jacquot's first companions were a camel, two monkeys, and a red"
8003,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,and blue parrot. One of the monkeys passed the greater part of his time
8004,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"on the bear's back, the other monkey and the parrot on the back of the"
8005,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,camel. But they were not a happy family: the monkeys and parrot bit and
8006,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"scratched, and generally tyrannised over, the patient camel and the"
8007,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,good-natured bear.
8008,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8009,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,[Illustration: Dog and monkey]
8010,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8011,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""The owner of these animals used to take them about in a caravan from"
8012,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"place to place, to exhibit them; but he was not kind to them, or did not"
8013,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"treat them properly, for the camel, one monkey, and the parrot died; and"
8014,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,when I made the acquaintance of Jacquot they had lately been replaced by
8015,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"a small leopard. So that the collection consisted then of a bear, a"
8016,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"monkey, and a leopard, the latter being kept in a strong-wooden cage."
8017,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8018,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""Just as the man finished speaking, a monkey jumped down from a manger,"
8019,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"and seized upon some cabbage leaves which the man, while talking to us,"
8020,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"had given poor Jacquot. The bear, who was enjoying his little bit of"
8021,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"greenmeat, objected to part with it; whereupon the monkey, looking like"
8022,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"a little fiend, seized upon an old saucepan which lay near, and"
8023,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,belaboured the poor bear cruelly upon the head and nose. Not content
8024,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"with this, it jumped upon the bear's back, and bit and tore the poor"
8025,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"creature, until the man took up a whip; at the sight of which the savage"
8026,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,monkey quickly made off into its manger again. From that moment I hated
8027,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"the monkey, and loved the poor, patient, oppressed, ill-used bear."
8028,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8029,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""During the next few days I used to pay a visit to Jacquot whenever I"
8030,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,could get my brother to take me into the stable; and on such occasions I
8031,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"always took him a present of fruit or cakes. More than once, also, I saw"
8032,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"him performing in the fair, and then it always seemed to me that he"
8033,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,looked out of the corner of his little eye as if he recognised me. There
8034,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"was a knowing twinkle in his eye which seemed to say,--'We don't appear"
8035,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"to be friends in public, but we have our pleasant little secret"
8036,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,interviews for all that.' It went to my heart to see how the patient
8037,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"creature was knocked about and ill-treated by his cruel master, who"
8038,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,always acted himself as showman. Poor Jacquot danced and went through
8039,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"his different performances hour after hour, with nothing but blows for"
8040,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,his reward. He was the principal performer: the monkey was not very
8041,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"clever, and did not do much; while the only trick that the leopard had"
8042,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"been taught was to jump through a hoop, which was thrust into his cage"
8043,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,between the bars. When not doing this he only walked backwards and
8044,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"forwards in his cage, to be looked at."
8045,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8046,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""One evening I had some nice cakes, which mamma had given me from the"
8047,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"dessert after dinner, to take to Jacquot. I looked about for my brother"
8048,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"to go with me into the stable, but not finding him, at last, after some"
8049,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"hesitation, I ventured to go alone. The coast was quite clear; there"
8050,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"seemed to be nobody about. I passed by the horses and mules, and went on"
8051,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"to the last stall, which was Jacquot's habitation."
8052,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8053,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,[Illustration: Leopard]
8054,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8055,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""He welcomed me with a friendly grunt, and while he was munching his"
8056,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"cakes, for which he seemed very grateful, I happened to look through an"
8057,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,open door which led into a room beyond the stable. This room was
8058,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"probably intended as a harness room, but I knew that in it the leopard"
8059,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"was kept. There was his cage, too, standing on the ground, just in the"
8060,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"place where I had seen it before; but I noticed, to my inexpressible"
8061,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"astonishment, that the cage was empty. I did not observe, or do not"
8062,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"remember, whether the cage door was open or the cage was broken; but the"
8063,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,conviction on my mind at once was that the leopard had escaped.
8064,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8065,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""In a corner of the stable was a heap of clean straw, on which the"
8066,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"keeper of the animals, Auguste,--the man who had told us the history of"
8067,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,Jacquot--was accustomed to lie down; probably it served for his bed at
8068,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"night. While I was wondering what could have become of the leopard, and"
8069,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"beginning to feel very frightened, I heard a rustling sound, and saw the"
8070,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"handsome, wicked-looking head of the creature peep from beneath the"
8071,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"straw; then slowly it crept out altogether, its eyes glaring at me, and"
8072,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,showing its teeth the while. It was just going to spring when my friend
8073,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"Jacquot saved my life. As I stood immovable from fear, Jacquot stepped"
8074,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"in front of me, the length of his chain just allowing it; and there he"
8075,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"stood up, exactly as a man might have done, to defend me. He gave a"
8076,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"tremendous growl as the leopard sprang upon him. I saw no more, but ran"
8077,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,off as fast as I could.
8078,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8079,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,[Illustration: Muzzled bear]
8080,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8081,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""In the courtyard I met Auguste, who had heard the bear growl, and was"
8082,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,running to see what had happened. I afterwards learnt that he had only
8083,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,been able to liberate poor Jacquot and secure the leopard by striking
8084,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"the latter on the head with an iron bar, which he kept always handy for"
8085,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,emergencies of the kind. The creature was stunned by the blow and
8086,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"restored to its cage, but both animals were very much hurt in the fight."
8087,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8088,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""Then the question arose, how was Jacquot to be rewarded for having"
8089,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,saved my life? My father said at once that he should like to buy the
8090,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"bear, so as to save it from further ill-treatment by its master, the"
8091,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"monkey, or the leopard. But when we had him what were we to do with him?"
8092,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,He could not be taken about with us like a pet dog. Then I proposed that
8093,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"it should be bought from its present owner, and made a present to"
8094,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"Auguste, who, I felt sure, would always treat it kindly. This plan was"
8095,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,carried out; and before we left Switzerland I had the satisfaction of
8096,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"knowing that Jacquot was earning a good living for itself, and for a"
8097,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"kind master, by its accomplishments."
8098,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,
8099,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""Many years afterwards I was staying at the house of some French friends"
8100,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"of ours near Versailles, when one of the children--for there was a large"
8101,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"family--ran into the drawing-room, looking very excited, to say that"
8102,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"there was a wonderful performing bear, which had come into the garden,"
8103,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"and they had now got it in the nursery, which opened on to the garden."
8104,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"The bear was doing the most extraordinary things, the child said, and"
8105,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,would we come to see it? We elders of the party went off to the nursery
8106,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"immediately, for it sounded alarming to have a bear playing with the"
8107,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"children. As we entered, I at once recognised in the bear's master, who"
8108,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"was standing in a corner of the room, and looking on with great pride at"
8109,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"his bear's performances, my old friend Auguste."

8111,AUNT TOTTY'S PETS:,"""I told Jacquot's story to my friends, and you may be sure the bear and"

8162,TIT FOR TAT.,Philip and Rosa work very hard at their lessons. They are the two oldest
8163,TIT FOR TAT.,"of a family of seven: Philip goes to college in the day-time, and Rosa"
8164,TIT FOR TAT.,"has a daily governess, so that in the evening they both have lessons to"
8165,TIT FOR TAT.,prepare for the next day; and they like to work quietly together in a
8166,TIT FOR TAT.,little room they call their school-room.
8167,TIT FOR TAT.,
8168,TIT FOR TAT.,One evening Philip had been having a game with one of his little
8169,TIT FOR TAT.,brothers. Tommy--that was the little brother's name--had had a present
8170,TIT FOR TAT.,"made to him of a bat and ball, and Philip showed him how to play. Now"
8171,TIT FOR TAT.,"Master Tommy was so pleased with the game, that when evening came on,"
8172,TIT FOR TAT.,"and it was time for him to go in, and when Philip, too, wanted to go to"
8173,TIT FOR TAT.,"his lessons, he would not leave off. At last Philip adopted the plan,"
8174,TIT FOR TAT.,"when Tommy's back was turned for a moment, of making the bat and ball"
8175,TIT FOR TAT.,disappear. Then Tommy began to cry; and his big brother assured him that
8176,TIT FOR TAT.,"""Bogy"" had taken the bat and ball; adding,--""But if you are a good boy"
8177,TIT FOR TAT.,"he'll bring them back to-morrow."" So saying, off he went to his work in"
8178,TIT FOR TAT.,the school-room.
8179,TIT FOR TAT.,
8180,TIT FOR TAT.,"Just when Philip and Rosa had settled to their work, with books and"
8181,TIT FOR TAT.,"slates scattered upon the table, a little figure, with knapsack on his"
8182,TIT FOR TAT.,"back, and cap much too large for him covering his head, crept quietly"
8183,TIT FOR TAT.,"into the room. They thought it best to take no notice of Master Tommy,"
8184,TIT FOR TAT.,"as then perhaps he might go away of himself; but presently, when they"
8185,TIT FOR TAT.,"were most occupied with their lessons, he suddenly slipped some of the"
8186,TIT FOR TAT.,"books from the table into his knapsack, and taking others and a slate"
8187,TIT FOR TAT.,"under his arm, ran out of the room. At the door he turned and cried out,"
8188,TIT FOR TAT.,"""Bogy's got 'em; if you good, perhaps he'll bring 'em 'gain to-morrow."""
8189,TIT FOR TAT.,
8190,TIT FOR TAT.,"Philip and Rosa pursued, and picked up the books, which Tommy dropped as"
8191,TIT FOR TAT.,he ran downstairs. They both took the joke very good-naturedly. Philip
8192,TIT FOR TAT.,declared it was only tit for tat; and Rosa supplied Tommy with a lot of
8193,TIT FOR TAT.,"old finery, for him to take into the nursery, that he and the other"
8194,TIT FOR TAT.,children might amuse themselves by dressing up.
8195,TIT FOR TAT.,
8196,TIT FOR TAT.,"After all, Tommy had capital fun that evening. The children dressed up,"

8242,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8243,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"Listen to me, now, my darling children, while I relate a wonderful"
8244,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"miracle, called ""The Raising of Lazarus."" I have already told you of"
8245,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"many instances in which our Saviour restored the sick to health, the"
8246,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,blind or deaf to sight or hearing. I have related one case--that of the
8247,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,daughter of Jairus--where He restored a child to life; but I am now
8248,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,going to describe how our Lord brought back to life a man who had been
8249,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,four days dead.
8250,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8251,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"In the little city of Bethany, in Judæa, lived a family which we are"
8252,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,told that Jesus loved. This family consisted of two sisters and a
8253,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"brother, and their names were Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. Now Lazarus"
8254,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"fell sick, and his sisters sent to tell Jesus of this. The message they"
8255,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"sent was simply, ""Lord, he whom Thou lovest is sick."" They made no"
8256,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"request, but probably they thought that the kind and good Lord who had"
8257,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"done so many works of mercy for others, would come and heal their"
8258,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,brother.
8259,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8260,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"When Jesus received this message, He was in the country beyond the river"
8261,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"Jordan, about thirty miles from Bethany, which is near Jerusalem. He had"
8262,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"retired to a distance from the latter city, because the priests and"
8263,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,Pharisees had succeeded in stirring up a portion of the populace against
8264,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"Him. His reply to the messengers was as follows:--""This sickness is not"
8265,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be"
8266,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"glorified thereby."" These seemed like words of comfort for the anxious"
8267,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,sisters; yet they saw their brother get worse hour after hour. The
8268,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,Saviour came not; and at length their brother died.
8269,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8270,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"And where was Jesus at the time? After receiving the message, He ""abode"
8271,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"two days still in the place where He was."" But this delay does not"
8272,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,appear to have arisen from any hesitation to return to the neighbourhood
8273,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"of Jerusalem. He said to His disciples, at the end of the two days,"
8274,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"""Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to"
8275,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"the intent ye may believe: nevertheless, let us go unto him."""
8276,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8277,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,These words appear to signify that our Saviour was glad He had not been
8278,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"with Lazarus when he was ill, because then He should have cured him, and"
8279,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,the miracle would not have been so wonderful as it would be now--not so
8280,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,likely to increase the faith of those who beheld it. Therefore He
8281,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,rejoiced that He should have to raise Lazarus from death to life instead
8282,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,of curing him of sickness.
8283,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8284,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,The disciples attempted to dissuade Christ from returning so near to
8285,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"Jerusalem, but finding Him resolved, they declared their willingness to"
8286,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"accompany Him, and they all departed together into the land of Judæa. As"
8287,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"they approached Bethany, Martha, hearing that the Lord was coming, went"
8288,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"out to meet Him, while Mary remained in the house. As soon as Martha met"
8289,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"Jesus, she thought, doubtless, of all the people He had so mercifully"
8290,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"healed by a touch of His hand or a word from His mouth, and said to Him,"
8291,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"""Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."" Then added"
8292,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"immediately afterwards, ""But I know that even now, whatever Thou wilt"
8293,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"ask of God, God will give it Thee."""
8294,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8295,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,These words of Martha's prove how strong her faith was. And Jesus
8296,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"answered her, saying, ""Thy brother shall rise again."""
8297,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8298,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,She does not seem to have felt sure that this promise was meant in the
8299,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,sense of restoring Lazarus to life; but what followed is best related in
8300,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"the words of St. John, who tells us:--"
8301,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8302,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"""Martha saith unto Him, 'I know that he shall rise again in the"
8303,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"resurrection at the last day.' Jesus said unto her, 'I am the"
8304,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead,"
8305,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never
8306,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"die. Believest thou this?' She saith unto Him, 'Yea, Lord: I believe"
8307,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the"
8308,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"world.' And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her"
8309,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"sister secretly, saying, 'The Master is come, and calleth for thee.'"""
8310,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8311,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"It was the custom among the Jews, when anybody died, for the friends and"
8312,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,neighbours of the bereaved family to gather round the remaining members
8313,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"of it, and mourn with them, or endeavour to console them. Mary was"
8314,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"surrounded by friends when Martha returned to her, and said, ""The Master"
8315,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"is come."" St. John goes on as follows:--"
8316,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8317,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"""As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto Him. Now"
8318,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"Jesus was not yet come unto the town, but was in that place where Martha"
8319,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"met Him. The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted"
8320,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed"
8321,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"her, saying, 'She goeth unto the grave, to weep there.' Then when Mary"
8322,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"was come where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying"
8323,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"unto Him, 'Lord, if Thou hads't been here my brother had not died.' When"
8324,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came"
8325,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"with her, He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled; and said, 'Where"
8326,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"have ye laid him?' They said unto Him, 'Lord, come and see.' Jesus"
8327,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"wept."""
8328,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8329,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"Christ, the Son of God, wept with the mourners. Although He knew He"
8330,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"should raise Lazarus from the dead, He shed tears at the sight of human"
8331,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,grief.
8332,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8333,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"They came to the grave. It was a sepulchre hewn out of the rock, and a"
8334,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,large stone had been rolled against the entrance. Jesus desired that
8335,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,this stone should be rolled away. Then Martha reminded Him that Lazarus
8336,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,had been dead four days. She said this because in hot countries like
8337,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"Judæa bodies decompose rapidly after death. But Christ replied,--""Said I"
8338,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the"
8339,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"glory of God?"""
8340,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8341,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"The stone was removed. Jesus first lifted up His eyes, and prayed, then"
8342,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"He cried in a loud voice,--""Lazarus, come forth!"""
8343,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,
8344,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"And the man who had been dead four days came forth, all wrapped in his"
8345,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"grave-clothes, and his face bound about with a napkin. Those who stood"
8346,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"round and beheld this miracle, were too astounded to approach Lazarus,"
8347,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"until Christ said,--""Loose him, and let him go."" St. John adds:--""Many"
8348,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"of the Jews which came with Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus"
8349,THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.,"did, believed on Him."""

8366,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"One very cold day in December last year, just before Christmas time, I"

8368,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"certain pair of little pattering feet trotting along beside me, and a"
8369,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,certain pair of bright blue eyes looking alternately up to my face and
8370,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,at the brilliantly decorated shops. Now and then we stopped to look in
8371,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"at the windows of the toy-shops, and see the beautiful toys, and other"
8372,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"pretty things displayed there. And now and then we did still better, for"
8373,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"we went in at the glass doors, and mingling with a host of other merry"
8374,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"Christmas folk, bought some of the pretty things we had been looking at"
8375,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,from the outside. Both Lily and I would come out of the shops laden with
8376,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"such a number of parcels--such a load of dolls and horses, balls and"
8377,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"musical instruments, that it was a wonder and a puzzle to ourselves how"
8378,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,we contrived to carry them all. I think my little Lily's slender arms
8379,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"grew stronger and longer for the occasion. Once, too, we went into a"
8380,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"pastrycook's, and came out with still an additional parcel or two: these"
8381,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,were intended for the little ones at home.
8382,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
8383,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,My Lily and I had lately made several expeditions of this kind in the
8384,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,service of a certain giant tree at home. For a long time this tree
8385,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"seemed insatiable: the greedy branches never had enough, though every"
8386,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"day new ornaments, or toys, or trinkets of some sort were hung upon"
8387,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,them. But to-day's was to be our last expedition; we needed only a few

8389,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
8390,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"We had just made up our minds to go into no more shops, but hurry home"

8392,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"against a poor little girl scarcely bigger than herself, though probably"
8393,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,about eight years old. The little girl had on a dress with short
8394,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"sleeves, although it was so cold; she had a little three-cornered grey"
8395,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"woollen shawl upon her shoulders, and a torn straw hat upon her head."
8396,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"This little girl was Janey; and my Lily, who was walking very fast, had"

8398,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
8399,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"As the two children recovered from the shock, I saw Janey turn her"

8401,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"we were carrying; when Lily, touched at the sight of the forlorn little"

8403,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,hand ever since we had been out. This half-crown had been given to her
8404,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"that morning by her god-father, and she had brought it out to spend it,"
8405,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,but had not done so. I thought it rather much to give to a strange
8406,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"child; but I said nothing, as the girl had already got the money safe in"
8407,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,her poor little cold red hand.
8408,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
8409,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"""It was my own, you know, mamma dear,"" pleaded my Lily, perhaps reading"

8411,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
8412,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"""Yes, dear,"" I replied, as I watched the expression of delight in both"

8415,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,
8416,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"The strange child murmured some words of thanks, and we continued on our"

8419,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"shop we had been to, I and Lily began to retrace our steps as quickly as"

8423,SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:,"sometimes at the shop window, sometimes at some oranges on a fruit stall"

8519,ASKING PARDON.,Cissy and Lily are feeding a little tame sparrow. The poor bird had
8520,ASKING PARDON.,"fallen out of its nest, and the gardener picked it up, and gave it to"
8521,ASKING PARDON.,"the children. The little creature sits on Cissy's finger, while Lily"
8522,ASKING PARDON.,"feeds it with bread and milk. It is getting quite tame, puts its little"
8523,ASKING PARDON.,"head on one side, and looks at Lily out of its pretty bright eye. The"
8524,ASKING PARDON.,"children have had it some days: it can fly a little now, but shows no"
8525,ASKING PARDON.,wish at present to fly away.
8526,ASKING PARDON.,
8527,ASKING PARDON.,"""I'm the mother of it,"" says Lily, ""tos I feed it."" Then she adds, after"
8528,ASKING PARDON.,"considering a moment: ""Cissy can be father if she likes."""
8529,ASKING PARDON.,
8530,ASKING PARDON.,"Cissy, aged nine years, smiles at this remark, and says,--""You don't"
8531,ASKING PARDON.,"know what you're talking about, my dear child; I can be aunt or"
8532,ASKING PARDON.,"grandmamma: Johnny can be father, if he likes."""
8533,ASKING PARDON.,
8534,ASKING PARDON.,Johnny is marching up and down the room with a gun over his shoulder. He
8535,ASKING PARDON.,"is two years old, and likes to be one thing at a time, so he answers in"
8536,ASKING PARDON.,"a gruff voice,--""No, me tan't: Donny soldar; tan't be father now;"" and"
8537,ASKING PARDON.,he continues his march.
8538,ASKING PARDON.,
8539,ASKING PARDON.,"""I shall call it Tommy,"" says Lily."
8540,ASKING PARDON.,
8541,ASKING PARDON.,"""Teddy's a prettier name,"" suggests Cissy."
8542,ASKING PARDON.,
8543,ASKING PARDON.,"""Shan't call it Teddy,"" rejoins Lily; ""peoples 'ill think he's a"
8544,ASKING PARDON.,"donkey."" Lily once knew a donkey who had that name."
8545,ASKING PARDON.,
8546,ASKING PARDON.,"""Pretty Teddy! Teddy! Teddy!"" cries Cissy in a teazing way. Whereupon"
8547,ASKING PARDON.,"Lily, who, I am sorry to say, is very short-tempered, raises her little"
8548,ASKING PARDON.,"hand, and brings it down smartly on Cissy's face. A skirmish takes"
8549,ASKING PARDON.,"place: the sparrow flies off to a distant part of the room; and mamma,"
8550,ASKING PARDON.,"coming in at the moment, finds voices raised, tears flowing, and red and"
8551,ASKING PARDON.,angry faces.
8552,ASKING PARDON.,
8553,ASKING PARDON.,"After hearing what each has to say, mamma thinks that both children have"
8554,ASKING PARDON.,"been very naughty, and she tells them to make it up. Neither will say"
8555,ASKING PARDON.,"that she is sorry. Then mamma looks very grave, and tells the children"
8556,ASKING PARDON.,how we ought always to ask pardon when we have done wrong.
8557,ASKING PARDON.,
8558,ASKING PARDON.,At last peace is restored: the little girls kiss each other and are
8559,ASKING PARDON.,"quite happy again. Then Cissy says:--""Sometimes people had better not"

8562,ASKING PARDON.,
8563,ASKING PARDON.,"""I doubt very much, dear, if there is any story of Hans Christian"

8567,ASKING PARDON.,"related every evening by the moon to a poor artist, who was fond of"
8568,ASKING PARDON.,looking at her from his window. The moon relates to him something she

8582,SECOND EVENING.,clucking hen with eleven chickens; and a pretty little girl was
8583,SECOND EVENING.,"running and jumping round them. The hen was frightened, and screamed,"
8584,SECOND EVENING.,and spread out her wings over the little brood. Then the girl's father
8585,SECOND EVENING.,came out and scolded her; and I glided away and thought no more of the
8586,SECOND EVENING.,matter.
8587,SECOND EVENING.,
8588,SECOND EVENING.,"""But this evening, only a few minutes ago, I looked down into the same"
8589,SECOND EVENING.,court-yard. Everything was quite quiet. But presently the little girl
8590,SECOND EVENING.,"came forth again, crept quietly to the hen-house, pushed back the"
8591,SECOND EVENING.,"bolts, and slipped into the apartment of the hen and chickens. They"
8592,SECOND EVENING.,"cried out loudly, and came fluttering down from their perches, and ran"
8593,SECOND EVENING.,"about in dismay, and the little girl ran after them. I saw it quite"
8594,SECOND EVENING.,"plainly, for I looked through a hole in the hen-house wall. I was"
8595,SECOND EVENING.,"angry with the wilful child, and felt glad when her father came out"
8596,SECOND EVENING.,"and scolded her more violently than yesterday, holding her roughly by"
8597,SECOND EVENING.,"the arm. She held down her head, and her blue eyes were full of large"
8598,SECOND EVENING.,"tears. 'What are you about here?' he asked. She wept, and said, 'I"
8599,SECOND EVENING.,wanted to kiss the hen and beg her pardon for frightening her
8600,SECOND EVENING.,yesterday; but I was afraid to tell you.'
8601,SECOND EVENING.,

8607,SECOND EVENING.,
8608,SECOND EVENING.,"""Why, my darling Cissy, this story does not teach that it is ever better"
8609,SECOND EVENING.,not to ask forgiveness. The little girl was only silly for thinking that
8610,SECOND EVENING.,"the hen could understand her, and so it happened that she only"
8611,SECOND EVENING.,frightened the poor creature instead of doing any good. If the hen could
8612,SECOND EVENING.,"have understood her, as little girls understand each other, it would"
8613,SECOND EVENING.,"have been very glad, I daresay, to let her kiss it. Besides, you see in"
8614,SECOND EVENING.,"the story, that directly the father knew his little girl had meant to"

8659,SWANS.,
8660,SWANS.,My little readers all know very well what a swan is like. Which of you
8661,SWANS.,has not seen the beautiful large bird sailing proudly on the water;
8662,SWANS.,"either on some river or lake, or perhaps on the Serpentine, or round a"
8663,SWANS.,"pond, in Kensington Gardens? How graceful the Swan is, with its long"
8664,SWANS.,"arched neck and pure white plumage! How grand it looks, turning slowly"
8665,SWANS.,"from side to side, followed perhaps by one or two cygnets! The mother"
8666,SWANS.,swan casts sharp glances round her to see that no one is daring to
8667,SWANS.,"interfere with her children. Then, too, how curiously she thrusts her"
8668,SWANS.,"long neck and head under the water, seeking for river weeds or some"
8669,SWANS.,water insect.
8670,SWANS.,
8671,SWANS.,In the picture there we see two swans and two growing-up cygnets. The
8672,SWANS.,"papa and mamma swans, and one of the cygnets, are all engaged in"
8673,SWANS.,obtaining food with their heads under water. Swans live upon water
8674,SWANS.,"plants, frogs, and insects; and some swans get a great deal of bread"
8675,SWANS.,"besides. Certain little friends of mine, and indeed almost all little"
8676,SWANS.,"children living at the west end of London, take delight in carrying out"
8677,SWANS.,pieces of bread for the swans in Kensington Gardens. These swans are
8678,SWANS.,"nearly always gentle to children, and will come waddling out of the"
8679,SWANS.,"water, and eat from the children's hands. I must say, however, if swans"
8680,SWANS.,"could know how awkward they look when waddling about on dry land, they"
8681,SWANS.,would never--at least if they care for admiration--show themselves out
8682,SWANS.,of their proper element. They are as awkward and ungainly in all their
8683,SWANS.,"movements when on land, as they are graceful in the water. I know few"
8684,SWANS.,prettier sights than that of a swan moving lazily along in summer on
8685,SWANS.,some calm lake or river; his reflection just broken now and then by the
8686,SWANS.,tiny wavelets that he makes in swimming.
8687,SWANS.,
8688,SWANS.,"Swans build their nests on the bank of some river or piece of water, or"
8689,SWANS.,still more frequently on some small island. In the nest the mother swan
8690,SWANS.,"lays six or seven greenish-white eggs, on which she sits patiently for"
8691,SWANS.,two months before the young cygnets appear. She nurses them with the
8692,SWANS.,"most tender care, teaching them to swim, and sometimes carrying them on"
8693,SWANS.,"her back when the water is rough, or the current strong."
8694,SWANS.,
8695,SWANS.,"I told you just now how gentle tame swans generally are, but I must add"
8696,SWANS.,that they are not always so. They are anything but gentle if you go near
8697,SWANS.,"their nests, or their young ones. When I was a little girl, and was"
8698,SWANS.,"staying at a country house, where there was a large lake, I had a very"
8699,SWANS.,disagreeable adventure with a swan.
8700,SWANS.,
8701,SWANS.,I had been feeding some swans in the morning with bread which I had
8702,SWANS.,"brought from breakfast. My governess had taken me down to the lake, and"
8703,SWANS.,"we had found the beautiful creatures perfectly tame. In the afternoon,"
8704,SWANS.,"after my early dinner, I took some bread from the table, thinking I"
8705,SWANS.,"would run down and feed them again. I ran off alone, for they had been"
8706,SWANS.,so gentle in the morning it did not occur to me that there was any
8707,SWANS.,"danger. Reaching the edge of the water, I found that my friends whom I"
8708,SWANS.,"had fed before had gone off to another part of the lake, but there was a"
8709,SWANS.,"solitary one not far away, sitting among some reeds upon the bank."
8710,SWANS.,
8711,SWANS.,"I approached it, and tried to make it come to me by calling, and by"
8712,SWANS.,holding out the bread in my hand; but it took not the slightest notice.
8713,SWANS.,"Then I threw some bread to it, when I saw its feathers rising as if it"
8714,SWANS.,"was growing angry. But I wanted to make it, either come to me, or go"
8715,SWANS.,"into the water, that I might see it swim; so at last I threw a piece of"
8716,SWANS.,"hard crust at it, calling out at the same time,--""You stupid thing, get"
8717,SWANS.,"up."" It did get up, and more quickly than I expected, for it ran at me"
8718,SWANS.,"as fast as it could waddle, hissing angrily, flapping its wings, and"
8719,SWANS.,"with all its feathers raised up. I was a tall child of eight years old,"
8720,SWANS.,"and could easily have escaped by running, but unluckily I stumbled and"
8721,SWANS.,fell just as I turned to run away. The swan instantly seized my dress in
8722,SWANS.,"his bill, while he beat me cruelly with his wings. My screams soon"
8723,SWANS.,"brought a gardener to the spot, who drove the swan away, but I was"
8724,SWANS.,already dreadfully bruised. Then the gardener warned me solemnly never
8725,SWANS.,to go near a sitting swan again: I had disturbed the poor swan while she
8726,SWANS.,was sitting on her eggs.

8787,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"suppose, my dear children, that I have told you all, or nearly all, the"
8788,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,miracles He performed.
8789,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,
8790,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,The crucifixion itself was marked by miracles: darkness overspread the
8791,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"land; the veil, or curtain, which hung before the sanctuary in the"
8792,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"temple, was rent in two; an earthquake tore asunder rocks and opened"
8793,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,graves; but all these were signs and wonders sent by God: they hardly
8794,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,can be classed among the miracles performed by Christ Himself.

8796,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"Our Saviour's last miracle, then, which I am going to tell you of"
8797,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"to-day, took place at the time of His seizure by the soldiers and people"
8798,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"the night before the crucifixion. I have already told you, my children,"
8799,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,the sad story of our Saviour's trial and crucifixion: I have told you
8800,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,how He was arrested during the night in the place called the garden of
8801,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"Gethsemane, at the foot of Mount Olivet, just outside Jerusalem. He was"
8802,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"there with several of His disciples, and was praying--perhaps for those"
8803,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,who He knew were about to inflict upon Him the suffering of a cruel
8804,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"death--when some soldiers and a crowd of people, led by the traitor"
8805,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"Judas, approached. What followed is thus described by St. John:--"
8806,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,
8807,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"""Jesus, therefore, knowing all things that should come upon Him, went"
8808,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"forth, and said unto them, 'Whom seek ye?' They answered Him, 'Jesus of"
8809,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"Nazareth.' Jesus saith unto them, 'I am he.' And Judas also, which"
8810,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"betrayed Him, stood with them. As soon, then, as He had said unto them,"
8811,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"'I am he,' they went backward, and fell to the ground. Then asked He"
8812,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"them again, 'Whom seek ye?' And they said, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' Jesus"
8813,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"answered, 'I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let"
8814,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"these go their way.'"""
8815,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,
8816,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,You see even at that moment Christ thought of the safety of His
8817,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"disciples, and in saying, ""let these go their way,"" He was requesting"
8818,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,that they might not be arrested with Him. When He advanced towards the
8819,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"soldiers and people saying, ""I am he,"" they were at first so impressed"
8820,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"with the composure and majesty of His Divine presence, that they started"
8821,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"back, and fell prostrate; or, as St. John says, ""fell to the ground."""
8822,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"This impression, however, passed quickly away; and, urged on, we may"
8823,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"suppose, by the priests and Pharisees who were with them, they kept to"
8824,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,their purpose of arresting Christ. The miracle which Jesus then did is
8825,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,thus related by St. Luke:--
8826,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,
8827,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"""When they which were about Him saw what would follow, they said unto"
8828,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"Him, 'Lord, shall we smite with the sword?' And one of them smote the"
8829,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"servant of the High Priest, and cut off his right ear. And Jesus"
8830,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"answered and said, 'Suffer ye thus far.' And He touched his ear, and"
8831,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"healed him."""
8832,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,
8833,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"Peter was the disciple, as we learn from the other evangelists, who cut"
8834,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"off this man's ear, and the man's name was Malchus. He was probably one"
8835,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"of the most forward in rudely seizing Jesus: but when he was wounded,"
8836,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"the compassion of the Saviour appeared. ""Suffer ye thus far,"" He cried"
8837,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"amidst the strife. They were probably binding Him with cords, and He"
8838,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"asked for a moment's liberty, that He might touch and heal the wounded"
8839,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,man.
8840,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,
8841,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,A word of reproof was addressed at the same time to the rash disciple.
8842,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,Our Saviour reminded Peter how easily He could obtain the protection of
8843,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"legions of angels, if He wished for any protection or defence at all."
8844,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"""But how then,"" said He, ""shall the scriptures be fulfilled?"" And He"
8845,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"added:--""The cup which my Father hath given me to drink, shall I not"
8846,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"drink it?"" He would exert no power to help Himself, but He performed a"
8847,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,miracle--His last miracle--to do good to an enemy. After this the
8848,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"disciples fled, and Jesus was conducted bound into Jerusalem."
8849,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,
8850,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,We are surprised to find that this miracle did not produce any
8851,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,conviction of the Divine mission of our Saviour upon the minds of the
8852,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"priests, Pharisees, and others who witnessed it: We can only suppose"
8853,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"that they had become familiar with miracles, and that those men whose"
8854,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,"interest or pride led them to oppose the teaching of Jesus, tried to"
8855,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,persuade themselves that these miracles were not done through a power
8856,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,derived from God. Yet the character of the miracles ought to have
8857,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,removed the possibility of doubt. Christ exercised His power to do good
8858,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,to the suffering and afflicted: the sick were healed; the blind and deaf
8859,HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.,restored to sight and hearing; the dead brought back to life.
