32,THE HERMIT THRUSH,
33,THE HERMIT THRUSH,The sweet fresh air of the new springtime
34,THE HERMIT THRUSH,Breathes o’er the woods where the blue hills climb
35,THE HERMIT THRUSH,Aloft from a belt of spruce and pine
36,THE HERMIT THRUSH,That hides their feet in a dark green line.
37,THE HERMIT THRUSH,On the edge of the wood where the white birch trees

50,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,
51,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,"Nod and bend in the passing breeze,"
52,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,A hermit lives who never is seen
53,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,Nearer the meadow’s rolling green
54,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,"Than the pasture bars beside the hill,"
55,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,"Where the road is lonely, dark, and still,"
56,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,And scarcely anyone passes by
57,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,"But the boy and cows, and squirrels shy."
58,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,"This hermit is brown, and small in size,"
59,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,And hides away from curious eyes;
60,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,"He wears no cowl and studies no book,"
61,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,
62,ALOFT FROM A BELT OF SPRUCE AND PINE,

66,BESIDE THE HILL,BESIDE THE HILL
67,BESIDE THE HILL,]
68,BESIDE THE HILL,
69,BESIDE THE HILL,
70,BESIDE THE HILL,[Illustration]
71,BESIDE THE HILL,
72,BESIDE THE HILL,Nor sits in a cave or sheltered nook;
73,BESIDE THE HILL,But up in the top of the tallest tree
74,BESIDE THE HILL,"At the edge of the wood, alone sits he,"
75,BESIDE THE HILL,"And sings his song in a wild sweet way,"
76,BESIDE THE HILL,Of the distant world so blithe and gay;
77,BESIDE THE HILL,How he retired from its youthful folly—
78,BESIDE THE HILL,And here there’s a touch of melancholy
79,BESIDE THE HILL,"In cadence soft; and the song’s complete,"
80,BESIDE THE HILL,With such a wealth of melody sweet
81,BESIDE THE HILL,"As never the organ’s pipe could blow,"
82,BESIDE THE HILL,
83,BESIDE THE HILL,[Illustration]
84,BESIDE THE HILL,
85,BESIDE THE HILL,Or ever musician could think or know.
86,BESIDE THE HILL,"Sometimes he sits in the gloaming still,"
87,BESIDE THE HILL,On the leaning birch beside the mill
88,BESIDE THE HILL,"And the old mill’s shaky, clumsy wheel,"
89,BESIDE THE HILL,"Worn out with the work of grinding meal,"
90,BESIDE THE HILL,"Frets and fusses and sputters away,"
91,BESIDE THE HILL,And beats the water to foam and spray;
92,BESIDE THE HILL,Its broken buckets dipping along
93,BESIDE THE HILL,In ill marked time to the thrush’s song.
94,BESIDE THE HILL,Never was music softer nor tune
95,BESIDE THE HILL,
96,BESIDE THE HILL,[Illustration:
97,BESIDE THE HILL,

105,ON THE LEANING BIRCH BESIDE THE MILL:,When the lowering sun shines slanting across
106,ON THE LEANING BIRCH BESIDE THE MILL:,"The rugged old pines, and the rocks, and moss."
107,ON THE LEANING BIRCH BESIDE THE MILL:,"Should you wish to hear this hermit thrush sing,"
108,ON THE LEANING BIRCH BESIDE THE MILL:,"And his song in the woods and welkin ring,"
109,ON THE LEANING BIRCH BESIDE THE MILL:,Then come where the blue notch mountains rise
110,ON THE LEANING BIRCH BESIDE THE MILL:,Far up in the north and pierce the skies;
111,ON THE LEANING BIRCH BESIDE THE MILL:,"Where Kinsman’s dome stands full and round,"
112,ON THE LEANING BIRCH BESIDE THE MILL:,And Lafayette’s pyramid peak is found;
113,ON THE LEANING BIRCH BESIDE THE MILL:,Where Pemigewasset’s silvery stream

123,SHINES SLANTING ACROSS,Winds through the valley with glint and gleam;
124,SHINES SLANTING ACROSS,There you will hear the heaven-born note
125,SHINES SLANTING ACROSS,"Swell from the thrush’s slender throat,"
126,SHINES SLANTING ACROSS,"And listening nature will breathless lie,"
127,SHINES SLANTING ACROSS,To hear the sweetest song of the sky!
