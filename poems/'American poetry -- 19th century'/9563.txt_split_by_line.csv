45,A HARVEST IDYL.,
46,A HARVEST IDYL.,"Susanna Martin, an aged woman of Amesbury, Mass., was tried and executed"
47,A HARVEST IDYL.,for the alleged crime of witchcraft. Her home was in what is now known
48,A HARVEST IDYL.,"as Pleasant Valley on the Merrimac, a little above the old Ferry way,"
49,A HARVEST IDYL.,"where, tradition says, an attempt was made to assassinate Sir Edmund"
50,A HARVEST IDYL.,"Andros on his way to Falmouth (afterward Portland) and Pemaquid, which"
51,A HARVEST IDYL.,was frustrated by a warning timely given. Goody Martin was the only
52,A HARVEST IDYL.,woman hanged on the north side of the Merrimac during the dreadful
53,A HARVEST IDYL.,delusion. The aged wife of Judge Bradbury who lived on the other side of
54,A HARVEST IDYL.,the Powow River was imprisoned and would have been put to death but for
55,A HARVEST IDYL.,the collapse of the hideous persecution.
56,A HARVEST IDYL.,
57,A HARVEST IDYL.,The substance of the poem which follows was published under the name of
58,A HARVEST IDYL.,"The Witch's Daughter, in The National Era in 1857. In 1875 my publishers"
59,A HARVEST IDYL.,"desired to issue it with illustrations, and I then enlarged it and"
60,A HARVEST IDYL.,otherwise altered it to its present form. The principal addition was in
61,A HARVEST IDYL.,the verses which constitute Part I.

64,PROEM.,PROEM.
65,PROEM.,I CALL the old time back: I bring my lay
66,PROEM.,in tender memory of the summer day
67,PROEM.,"When, where our native river lapsed away,"
68,PROEM.,
69,PROEM.,"We dreamed it over, while the thrushes made"
70,PROEM.,"Songs of their own, and the great pine-trees laid"
71,PROEM.,On warm noonlights the masses of their shade.
72,PROEM.,
73,PROEM.,"And she was with us, living o'er again"
74,PROEM.,"Her life in ours, despite of years and pain,--"
75,PROEM.,The Autumn's brightness after latter rain.
76,PROEM.,
77,PROEM.,Beautiful in her holy peace as one
78,PROEM.,"Who stands, at evening, when the work is done,"
79,PROEM.,Glorified in the setting of the sun!
80,PROEM.,
81,PROEM.,Her memory makes our common landscape seem
82,PROEM.,Fairer than any of which painters dream;
83,PROEM.,Lights the brown hills and sings in every stream;
84,PROEM.,
85,PROEM.,For she whose speech was always truth's pure gold
86,PROEM.,"Heard, not unpleased, its simple legends told,"
87,PROEM.,And loved with us the beautiful and old.

90,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.
91,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Across the level tableland,"
92,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"A grassy, rarely trodden way,"
93,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,With thinnest skirt of birchen spray
94,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
95,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"And stunted growth of cedar, leads"
96,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,To where you see the dull plain fall
97,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Sheer off, steep-slanted, ploughed by all"
98,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
99,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,The seasons' rainfalls. On its brink
100,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"The over-leaning harebells swing,"
101,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,With roots half bare the pine-trees cling;
102,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
103,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"And, through the shadow looking west,"
104,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,You see the wavering river flow
105,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Along a vale, that far below"
106,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
107,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Holds to the sun, the sheltering hills"
108,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"And glimmering water-line between,"
109,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Broad fields of corn and meadows green,"
110,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
111,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,And fruit-bent orchards grouped around
112,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"The low brown roofs and painted eaves,"
113,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,And chimney-tops half hid in leaves.
114,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
115,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,No warmer valley hides behind
116,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Yon wind-scourged sand-dunes, cold and bleak;"
117,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,No fairer river comes to seek
118,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
119,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"The wave-sung welcome of the sea,"
120,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,Or mark the northmost border line
121,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,Of sun-loved growths of nut and vine.
122,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
123,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Here, ground-fast in their native fields,"
124,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Untempted by the city's gain,"
125,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,The quiet farmer folk remain
126,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
127,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Who bear the pleasant name of Friends,"
128,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,And keep their fathers' gentle ways
129,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,And simple speech of Bible days;
130,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
131,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,In whose neat homesteads woman holds
132,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"With modest ease her equal place,"
133,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,And wears upon her tranquil face
134,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
135,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"The look of one who, merging not"
136,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Her self-hood in another's will,"
137,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,Is love's and duty's handmaid still.
138,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
139,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,Pass with me down the path that winds
140,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Through birches to the open land,"
141,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Where, close upon the river strand"
142,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
143,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"You mark a cellar, vine o'errun,"
144,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,Above whose wall of loosened stones
145,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"The sumach lifts its reddening cones,"
146,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
147,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"And the black nightshade's berries shine,"
148,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"And broad, unsightly burdocks fold"
149,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"The household ruin, century-old."
150,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
151,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Here, in the dim colonial time"
152,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Of sterner lives and gloomier faith,"
153,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"A woman lived, tradition saith,"
154,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
155,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Who wrought her neighbors foul annoy,"
156,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"And witched and plagued the country-side,"
157,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,Till at the hangman's hand she died.
158,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
159,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,Sit with me while the westering day
160,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Falls slantwise down the quiet vale,"
161,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"And, haply ere yon loitering sail,"
162,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
163,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"That rounds the upper headland, falls"
164,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Below Deer Island's pines, or sees"
165,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,Behind it Hawkswood's belt of trees
166,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
167,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"Rise black against the sinking sun,"
168,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"My idyl of its days of old,"
169,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,"The valley's legend, shall be told."
170,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
171,I. THE RIVER VALLEY.,
172,II. THE HUSKING.,II. THE HUSKING.
173,II. THE HUSKING.,"It was the pleasant harvest-time,"
174,II. THE HUSKING.,"When cellar-bins are closely stowed,"
175,II. THE HUSKING.,"And garrets bend beneath their load,"
176,II. THE HUSKING.,
177,II. THE HUSKING.,"And the old swallow-haunted barns,--"
178,II. THE HUSKING.,"Brown-gabled, long, and full of seams"
179,II. THE HUSKING.,"Through which the rooted sunlight streams,"
180,II. THE HUSKING.,
181,II. THE HUSKING.,"And winds blow freshly in, to shake"
182,II. THE HUSKING.,"The red plumes of the roosted cocks,"
183,II. THE HUSKING.,"And the loose hay-mow's scented locks,"
184,II. THE HUSKING.,
185,II. THE HUSKING.,"Are filled with summer's ripened stores,"
186,II. THE HUSKING.,"Its odorous grass and barley sheaves,"
187,II. THE HUSKING.,From their low scaffolds to their eaves.
188,II. THE HUSKING.,
189,II. THE HUSKING.,"On Esek Harden's oaken floor,"
190,II. THE HUSKING.,"With many an autumn threshing worn,"
191,II. THE HUSKING.,Lay the heaped ears of unhusked corn.
192,II. THE HUSKING.,
193,II. THE HUSKING.,"And thither came young men and maids,"
194,II. THE HUSKING.,"Beneath a moon that, large and low,"
195,II. THE HUSKING.,Lit that sweet eve of long ago.
196,II. THE HUSKING.,
197,II. THE HUSKING.,"They took their places; some by chance,"
198,II. THE HUSKING.,And others by a merry voice
199,II. THE HUSKING.,Or sweet smile guided to their choice.
200,II. THE HUSKING.,
201,II. THE HUSKING.,"How pleasantly the rising moon,"
202,II. THE HUSKING.,"Between the shadow of the mows,"
203,II. THE HUSKING.,Looked on them through the great elm-boughs!
204,II. THE HUSKING.,
205,II. THE HUSKING.,"On sturdy boyhood, sun-embrowned,"
206,II. THE HUSKING.,On girlhood with its solid curves
207,II. THE HUSKING.,Of healthful strength and painless nerves!
208,II. THE HUSKING.,
209,II. THE HUSKING.,"And jests went round, and laughs that made"
210,II. THE HUSKING.,"The house-dog answer with his howl,"
211,II. THE HUSKING.,And kept astir the barn-yard fowl;
212,II. THE HUSKING.,
213,II. THE HUSKING.,And quaint old songs their fathers sung
214,II. THE HUSKING.,"In Derby dales and Yorkshire moors,"
215,II. THE HUSKING.,Ere Norman William trod their shores;
216,II. THE HUSKING.,
217,II. THE HUSKING.,"And tales, whose merry license shook"
218,II. THE HUSKING.,"The fat sides of the Saxon thane,"
219,II. THE HUSKING.,"Forgetful of the hovering Dane,--"
220,II. THE HUSKING.,
221,II. THE HUSKING.,"Rude plays to Celt and Cimbri known,"
222,II. THE HUSKING.,The charms and riddles that beguiled
223,II. THE HUSKING.,"On Oxus' banks the young world's child,--"
224,II. THE HUSKING.,
225,II. THE HUSKING.,That primal picture-speech wherein
226,II. THE HUSKING.,"Have youth and maid the story told,"
227,II. THE HUSKING.,"So new in each, so dateless old,"
228,II. THE HUSKING.,
229,II. THE HUSKING.,Recalling pastoral Ruth in her
230,II. THE HUSKING.,"Who waited, blushing and demure,"
231,II. THE HUSKING.,The red-ear's kiss of forfeiture.
232,II. THE HUSKING.,
233,II. THE HUSKING.,But still the sweetest voice was mute
234,II. THE HUSKING.,That river-valley ever heard
235,II. THE HUSKING.,From lips of maid or throat of bird;
236,II. THE HUSKING.,
237,II. THE HUSKING.,"For Mabel Martin sat apart,"
238,II. THE HUSKING.,And let the hay-mow's shadow fall
239,II. THE HUSKING.,Upon the loveliest face of all.
240,II. THE HUSKING.,
241,II. THE HUSKING.,"She sat apart, as one forbid,"
242,II. THE HUSKING.,Who knew that none would condescend
243,II. THE HUSKING.,To own the Witch-wife's child a friend.
244,II. THE HUSKING.,
245,II. THE HUSKING.,"The seasons scarce had gone their round,"
246,II. THE HUSKING.,Since curious thousands thronged to see
247,II. THE HUSKING.,Her mother at the gallows-tree;
248,II. THE HUSKING.,
249,II. THE HUSKING.,And mocked the prison-palsied limbs
250,II. THE HUSKING.,"That faltered on the fatal stairs,"
251,II. THE HUSKING.,And wan lip trembling with its prayers!
252,II. THE HUSKING.,
253,II. THE HUSKING.,"Few questioned of the sorrowing child,"
254,II. THE HUSKING.,"Or, when they saw the mother die;"
255,II. THE HUSKING.,Dreamed of the daughter's agony.
256,II. THE HUSKING.,
257,II. THE HUSKING.,"They went up to their homes that day,"
258,II. THE HUSKING.,As men and Christians justified
259,II. THE HUSKING.,"God willed it, and the wretch had died!"
260,II. THE HUSKING.,
261,II. THE HUSKING.,"Dear God and Father of us all,"
262,II. THE HUSKING.,"Forgive our faith in cruel lies,--"
263,II. THE HUSKING.,Forgive the blindness that denies!
264,II. THE HUSKING.,
265,II. THE HUSKING.,"Forgive thy creature when he takes,"
266,II. THE HUSKING.,"For the all-perfect love Thou art,"
267,II. THE HUSKING.,Some grim creation of his heart.
268,II. THE HUSKING.,
269,II. THE HUSKING.,"Cast down our idols, overturn"
270,II. THE HUSKING.,Our bloody altars; let us see
271,II. THE HUSKING.,Thyself in Thy humanity!
272,II. THE HUSKING.,
273,II. THE HUSKING.,Young Mabel from her mother's grave
274,II. THE HUSKING.,"Crept to her desolate hearth-stone,"
275,II. THE HUSKING.,And wrestled with her fate alone;
276,II. THE HUSKING.,
277,II. THE HUSKING.,"With love, and anger, and despair,"
278,II. THE HUSKING.,"The phantoms of disordered sense,"
279,II. THE HUSKING.,The awful doubts of Providence!
280,II. THE HUSKING.,
281,II. THE HUSKING.,"Oh, dreary broke the winter days,"
282,II. THE HUSKING.,And dreary fell the winter nights
283,II. THE HUSKING.,"When, one by one, the neighboring lights"
284,II. THE HUSKING.,
285,II. THE HUSKING.,"Went out, and human sounds grew still,"
286,II. THE HUSKING.,And all the phantom-peopled dark
287,II. THE HUSKING.,Closed round her hearth-fire's dying spark.
288,II. THE HUSKING.,
289,II. THE HUSKING.,"And summer days were sad and long,"
290,II. THE HUSKING.,"And sad the uncompanioned eves,"
291,II. THE HUSKING.,"And sadder sunset-tinted leaves,"
292,II. THE HUSKING.,
293,II. THE HUSKING.,And Indian Summer's airs of balm;
294,II. THE HUSKING.,"She scarcely felt the soft caress,"
295,II. THE HUSKING.,The beauty died of loneliness!
296,II. THE HUSKING.,
297,II. THE HUSKING.,"The school-boys jeered her as they passed,"
298,II. THE HUSKING.,"And, when she sought the house of prayer,"
299,II. THE HUSKING.,Her mother's curse pursued her there.
300,II. THE HUSKING.,
301,II. THE HUSKING.,And still o'er many a neighboring door
302,II. THE HUSKING.,"She saw the horseshoe's curved charm,"
303,II. THE HUSKING.,To guard against her mother's harm!
304,II. THE HUSKING.,
305,II. THE HUSKING.,"That mother, poor and sick and lame,"
306,II. THE HUSKING.,"Who daily, by the old arm-chair,"
307,II. THE HUSKING.,Folded her withered hands in prayer;--
308,II. THE HUSKING.,
309,II. THE HUSKING.,"Who turned, in Salem's dreary jail,"
310,II. THE HUSKING.,"Her worn old Bible o'er and o'er,"
311,II. THE HUSKING.,When her dim eyes could read no more!
312,II. THE HUSKING.,
313,II. THE HUSKING.,"Sore tried and pained, the poor girl kept"
314,II. THE HUSKING.,"Her faith, and trusted that her way,"
315,II. THE HUSKING.,"So dark, would somewhere meet the day."
316,II. THE HUSKING.,
317,II. THE HUSKING.,And still her weary wheel went round
318,II. THE HUSKING.,"Day after day, with no relief"
319,II. THE HUSKING.,Small leisure have the poor for grief.
320,II. THE HUSKING.,
321,II. THE HUSKING.,
322,IV. THE CHAMPION.,IV. THE CHAMPION.
323,IV. THE CHAMPION.,So in the shadow Mabel sits;
324,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"Untouched by mirth she sees and hears,"
325,IV. THE CHAMPION.,Her smile is sadder than her tears.
326,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
327,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"But cruel eyes have found her out,"
328,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"And cruel lips repeat her name,"
329,IV. THE CHAMPION.,And taunt her with her mother's shame.
330,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
331,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"She answered not with railing words,"
332,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"But drew her apron o'er her face,"
333,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"And, sobbing, glided from the place."
334,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
335,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"And only pausing at the door,"
336,IV. THE CHAMPION.,Her sad eyes met the troubled gaze
337,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"Of one who, in her better days,"
338,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
339,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"Had been her warm and steady friend,"
340,IV. THE CHAMPION.,Ere yet her mother's doom had made
341,IV. THE CHAMPION.,Even Esek Harden half afraid.
342,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
343,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"He felt that mute appeal of tears,"
344,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"And, starting, with an angry frown,"
345,IV. THE CHAMPION.,Hushed all the wicked murmurs down.
346,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
347,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"""Good neighbors mine,"" he sternly said,"
348,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"""This passes harmless mirth or jest;"
349,IV. THE CHAMPION.,I brook no insult to my guest.
350,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
351,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"""She is indeed her mother's child;"
352,IV. THE CHAMPION.,But God's sweet pity ministers
353,IV. THE CHAMPION.,Unto no whiter soul than hers.
354,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
355,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"""Let Goody Martin rest in peace;"
356,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"I never knew her harm a fly,"
357,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"And witch or not, God knows--not I."
358,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
359,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"""I know who swore her life away;"
360,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"And as God lives, I'd not condemn"
361,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"An Indian dog on word of them."""
362,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
363,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"The broadest lands in all the town,"
364,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"The skill to guide, the power to awe,"
365,IV. THE CHAMPION.,Were Harden's; and his word was law.
366,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
367,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"None dared withstand him to his face,"
368,IV. THE CHAMPION.,But one sly maiden spake aside
369,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"""The little witch is evil-eyed!"
370,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
371,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"""Her mother only killed a cow,"
372,IV. THE CHAMPION.,Or witched a churn or dairy-pan;
373,IV. THE CHAMPION.,"But she, forsooth, must charm a man!"""
374,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
375,IV. THE CHAMPION.,
376,V. IN THE SHADOW.,V. IN THE SHADOW.
377,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"Poor Mabel, homeward turning, passed"
378,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"The nameless terrors of the wood,"
379,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"And saw, as if a ghost pursued,"
380,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
381,V. IN THE SHADOW.,Her shadow gliding in the moon;
382,V. IN THE SHADOW.,The soft breath of the west-wind gave
383,V. IN THE SHADOW.,A chill as from her mother's grave.
384,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
385,V. IN THE SHADOW.,How dreary seemed the silent house!
386,V. IN THE SHADOW.,Wide in the moonbeams' ghastly glare
387,V. IN THE SHADOW.,Its windows had a dead man's stare!
388,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
389,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"And, like a gaunt and spectral hand,"
390,V. IN THE SHADOW.,The tremulous shadow of a birch
391,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"Reached out and touched the door's low porch,"
392,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
393,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"As if to lift its latch; hard by,"
394,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"A sudden warning call she beard,"
395,V. IN THE SHADOW.,The night-cry of a boding bird.
396,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
397,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"She leaned against the door; her face,"
398,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"So fair, so young, so full of pain,"
399,V. IN THE SHADOW.,White in the moonlight's silver rain.
400,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
401,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"The river, on its pebbled rim,"
402,V. IN THE SHADOW.,Made music such as childhood knew;
403,V. IN THE SHADOW.,The door-yard tree was whispered through
404,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
405,V. IN THE SHADOW.,By voices such as childhood's ear
406,V. IN THE SHADOW.,Had heard in moonlights long ago;
407,V. IN THE SHADOW.,And through the willow-boughs below.
408,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
409,V. IN THE SHADOW.,She saw the rippled waters shine;
410,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"Beyond, in waves of shade and light,"
411,V. IN THE SHADOW.,The hills rolled off into the night.
412,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
413,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"She saw and heard, but over all"
414,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"A sense of some transforming spell,"
415,V. IN THE SHADOW.,The shadow of her sick heart fell.
416,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
417,V. IN THE SHADOW.,And still across the wooded space
418,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"The harvest lights of Harden shone,"
419,V. IN THE SHADOW.,And song and jest and laugh went on.
420,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
421,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"And he, so gentle, true, and strong,"
422,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"Of men the bravest and the best,"
423,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"Had he, too, scorned her with the rest?"
424,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
425,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"She strove to drown her sense of wrong,"
426,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"And, in her old and simple way,"
427,V. IN THE SHADOW.,To teach her bitter heart to pray.
428,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
429,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"Poor child! the prayer, begun in faith,"
430,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"Grew to a low, despairing cry"
431,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"Of utter misery: ""Let me die!"
432,V. IN THE SHADOW.,
433,V. IN THE SHADOW.,"""Oh! take me from the scornful eyes,"
434,V. IN THE SHADOW.,And hide me where the cruel speech
435,V. IN THE SHADOW.,And mocking finger may not reach!
436,V. IN THE SHADOW.,

795,THE PREACHER.,"There rest the marvellous prophet's bones."""
796,THE PREACHER.,"Then as our homeward way we walked,"
797,THE PREACHER.,Of the great preacher's life we talked;
798,THE PREACHER.,And through the mystery of our theme
799,THE PREACHER.,"The outward glory seemed to stream,"
800,THE PREACHER.,And Nature's self interpreted
801,THE PREACHER.,The doubtful record of the dead;
802,THE PREACHER.,And every level beam that smote
803,THE PREACHER.,The sails upon the dark afloat
804,THE PREACHER.,"A symbol of the light became,"
805,THE PREACHER.,"Which touched the shadows of our blame,"
806,THE PREACHER.,With tongues of Pentecostal flame.
807,THE PREACHER.,
808,THE PREACHER.,Over the roofs of the pioneers
809,THE PREACHER.,Gathers the moss of a hundred years;
810,THE PREACHER.,On man and his works has passed the change
811,THE PREACHER.,Which needs must be in a century's range.
812,THE PREACHER.,"The land lies open and warm in the sun,"
813,THE PREACHER.,"Anvils clamor and mill-wheels run,--"
814,THE PREACHER.,"Flocks on the hillsides, herds on the plain,"
815,THE PREACHER.,The wilderness gladdened with fruit and grain!
816,THE PREACHER.,But the living faith of the settlers old
817,THE PREACHER.,A dead profession their children hold;
818,THE PREACHER.,To the lust of office and greed of trade
819,THE PREACHER.,A stepping-stone is the altar made.
820,THE PREACHER.,
821,THE PREACHER.,"The church, to place and power the door,"
822,THE PREACHER.,"Rebukes the sin of the world no more,"
823,THE PREACHER.,Nor sees its Lord in the homeless poor.
824,THE PREACHER.,"Everywhere is the grasping hand,"
825,THE PREACHER.,And eager adding of land to land;
826,THE PREACHER.,"And earth, which seemed to the fathers meant"
827,THE PREACHER.,"But as a pilgrim's wayside tent,--"
828,THE PREACHER.,A nightly shelter to fold away
829,THE PREACHER.,"When the Lord should call at the break of day,--"
830,THE PREACHER.,"Solid and steadfast seems to be,"
831,THE PREACHER.,And Time has forgotten Eternity!
832,THE PREACHER.,
833,THE PREACHER.,But fresh and green from the rotting roots
834,THE PREACHER.,Of primal forests the young growth shoots;
835,THE PREACHER.,"From the death of the old the new proceeds,"
836,THE PREACHER.,And the life of truth from the rot of creeds
837,THE PREACHER.,"On the ladder of God, which upward leads,"
838,THE PREACHER.,The steps of progress are human needs.
839,THE PREACHER.,"For His judgments still are a mighty deep,"
840,THE PREACHER.,And the eyes of His providence never sleep
841,THE PREACHER.,When the night is darkest He gives the morn;
842,THE PREACHER.,"When the famine is sorest, the wine and corn!"
843,THE PREACHER.,
844,THE PREACHER.,"In the church of the wilderness Edwards wrought,"
845,THE PREACHER.,Shaping his creed at the forge of thought;
846,THE PREACHER.,And with Thor's own hammer welded and bent
847,THE PREACHER.,"The iron links of his argument,"
848,THE PREACHER.,Which strove to grasp in its mighty span
849,THE PREACHER.,The purpose of God and the fate of man
850,THE PREACHER.,"Yet faithful still, in his daily round"
851,THE PREACHER.,"To the weak, and the poor, and sin-sick found,"
852,THE PREACHER.,The schoolman's lore and the casuist's art
853,THE PREACHER.,Drew warmth and life from his fervent heart.
854,THE PREACHER.,
855,THE PREACHER.,Had he not seen in the solitudes
856,THE PREACHER.,Of his deep and dark Northampton woods
857,THE PREACHER.,A vision of love about him fall?
858,THE PREACHER.,"Not the blinding splendor which fell on Saul,"
859,THE PREACHER.,But the tenderer glory that rests on them
860,THE PREACHER.,"Who walk in the New Jerusalem,"
861,THE PREACHER.,"Where never the sun nor moon are known,"
862,THE PREACHER.,But the Lord and His love are the light alone
863,THE PREACHER.,"And watching the sweet, still countenance"
864,THE PREACHER.,"Of the wife of his bosom rapt in trance,"
865,THE PREACHER.,Had he not treasured each broken word
866,THE PREACHER.,Of the mystical wonder seen and heard;
867,THE PREACHER.,And loved the beautiful dreamer more
868,THE PREACHER.,That thus to the desert of earth she bore
869,THE PREACHER.,Clusters of Eshcol from Canaan's shore?
870,THE PREACHER.,
871,THE PREACHER.,"As the barley-winnower, holding with pain"
872,THE PREACHER.,"Aloft in waiting his chaff and grain,"
873,THE PREACHER.,Joyfully welcomes the far-off breeze
874,THE PREACHER.,"Sounding the pine-tree's slender keys,"
875,THE PREACHER.,So he who had waited long to hear
876,THE PREACHER.,"The sound of the Spirit drawing near,"
877,THE PREACHER.,Like that which the son of Iddo heard
878,THE PREACHER.,"When the feet of angels the myrtles stirred,"
879,THE PREACHER.,"Felt the answer of prayer, at last,"
880,THE PREACHER.,"As over his church the afflatus passed,"
881,THE PREACHER.,Breaking its sleep as breezes break
882,THE PREACHER.,To sun-bright ripples a stagnant lake.
883,THE PREACHER.,
884,THE PREACHER.,"At first a tremor of silent fear,"
885,THE PREACHER.,"The creep of the flesh at danger near,"
886,THE PREACHER.,"A vague foreboding and discontent,"
887,THE PREACHER.,Over the hearts of the people went.
888,THE PREACHER.,All nature warned in sounds and signs
889,THE PREACHER.,The wind in the tops of the forest pines
890,THE PREACHER.,"In the name of the Highest called to prayer,"
891,THE PREACHER.,As the muezzin calls from the minaret stair.
892,THE PREACHER.,Through ceiled chambers of secret sin
893,THE PREACHER.,Sudden and strong the light shone in;
894,THE PREACHER.,A guilty sense of his neighbor's needs
895,THE PREACHER.,Startled the man of title-deeds;
896,THE PREACHER.,The trembling hand of the worldling shook
897,THE PREACHER.,The dust of years from the Holy Book;
898,THE PREACHER.,"And the psalms of David, forgotten long,"
899,THE PREACHER.,Took the place of the scoffer's song.
900,THE PREACHER.,
901,THE PREACHER.,The impulse spread like the outward course
902,THE PREACHER.,Of waters moved by a central force;
903,THE PREACHER.,The tide of spiritual life rolled down
904,THE PREACHER.,From inland mountains to seaboard town.
905,THE PREACHER.,
906,THE PREACHER.,Prepared and ready the altar stands
907,THE PREACHER.,Waiting the prophet's outstretched hands
908,THE PREACHER.,"And prayer availing, to downward call"
909,THE PREACHER.,The fiery answer in view of all.
910,THE PREACHER.,Hearts are like wax in the furnace; who
911,THE PREACHER.,"Shall mould, and shape, and cast them anew?"
912,THE PREACHER.,Lo! by the Merrimac Whitefield stands
913,THE PREACHER.,"In the temple that never was made by hands,--"
914,THE PREACHER.,"Curtains of azure, and crystal wall,"
915,THE PREACHER.,And dome of the sunshine over all--
916,THE PREACHER.,"A homeless pilgrim, with dubious name"
917,THE PREACHER.,Blown about on the winds of fame;
918,THE PREACHER.,"Now as an angel of blessing classed,"
919,THE PREACHER.,And now as a mad enthusiast.
920,THE PREACHER.,Called in his youth to sound and gauge
921,THE PREACHER.,"The moral lapse of his race and age,"
922,THE PREACHER.,"And, sharp as truth, the contrast draw"
923,THE PREACHER.,Of human frailty and perfect law;
924,THE PREACHER.,Possessed by the one dread thought that lent
925,THE PREACHER.,"Its goad to his fiery temperament,"
926,THE PREACHER.,"Up and down the world he went,"
927,THE PREACHER.,"A John the Baptist crying, Repent!"
928,THE PREACHER.,
929,THE PREACHER.,No perfect whole can our nature make;
930,THE PREACHER.,Here or there the circle will break;
931,THE PREACHER.,The orb of life as it takes the light
932,THE PREACHER.,On one side leaves the other in night.
933,THE PREACHER.,Never was saint so good and great
934,THE PREACHER.,As to give no chance at St. Peter's gate
935,THE PREACHER.,For the plea of the Devil's advocate.
936,THE PREACHER.,"So, incomplete by his being's law,"
937,THE PREACHER.,The marvellous preacher had his flaw;
938,THE PREACHER.,"With step unequal, and lame with faults,"
939,THE PREACHER.,His shade on the path of History halts.
940,THE PREACHER.,
941,THE PREACHER.,Wisely and well said the Eastern bard
942,THE PREACHER.,"Fear is easy, but love is hard,--"
943,THE PREACHER.,"Easy to glow with the Santon's rage,"
944,THE PREACHER.,And walk on the Meccan pilgrimage;
945,THE PREACHER.,But he is greatest and best who can
946,THE PREACHER.,Worship Allah by loving man.
947,THE PREACHER.,"Thus he,--to whom, in the painful stress"
948,THE PREACHER.,"Of zeal on fire from its own excess,"
949,THE PREACHER.,Heaven seemed so vast and earth so small
950,THE PREACHER.,"That man was nothing, since God was all,--"
951,THE PREACHER.,"Forgot, as the best at times have done,"
952,THE PREACHER.,That the love of the Lord and of man are one.
953,THE PREACHER.,Little to him whose feet unshod
954,THE PREACHER.,"The thorny path of the desert trod,"
955,THE PREACHER.,"Careless of pain, so it led to God,"
956,THE PREACHER.,"Seemed the hunger-pang and the poor man's wrong,"
957,THE PREACHER.,The weak ones trodden beneath the strong.
958,THE PREACHER.,Should the worm be chooser?--the clay withstand
959,THE PREACHER.,The shaping will of the potter's hand?
960,THE PREACHER.,
961,THE PREACHER.,In the Indian fable Arjoon hears
962,THE PREACHER.,The scorn of a god rebuke his fears
963,THE PREACHER.,"""Spare thy pity!"" Krishna saith;"
964,THE PREACHER.,"""Not in thy sword is the power of death!"
965,THE PREACHER.,"All is illusion,--loss but seems;"
966,THE PREACHER.,Pleasure and pain are only dreams;
967,THE PREACHER.,Who deems he slayeth doth not kill;
968,THE PREACHER.,Who counts as slain is living still.
969,THE PREACHER.,"Strike, nor fear thy blow is crime;"
970,THE PREACHER.,Nothing dies but the cheats of time;
971,THE PREACHER.,"Slain or slayer, small the odds"
972,THE PREACHER.,"To each, immortal as Indra's gods!"""
973,THE PREACHER.,
974,THE PREACHER.,"So by Savannah's banks of shade,"
975,THE PREACHER.,The stones of his mission the preacher laid
976,THE PREACHER.,"On the heart of the negro crushed and rent,"
977,THE PREACHER.,And made of his blood the wall's cement;
978,THE PREACHER.,"Bade the slave-ship speed from coast to coast,"
979,THE PREACHER.,Fanned by the wings of the Holy Ghost;
980,THE PREACHER.,"And begged, for the love of Christ, the gold"
981,THE PREACHER.,Coined from the hearts in its groaning hold.
982,THE PREACHER.,"What could it matter, more or less"
983,THE PREACHER.,"Of stripes, and hunger, and weariness?"
984,THE PREACHER.,"Living or dying, bond or free,"
985,THE PREACHER.,What was time to eternity?
986,THE PREACHER.,
987,THE PREACHER.,Alas for the preacher's cherished schemes!
988,THE PREACHER.,Mission and church are now but dreams;
989,THE PREACHER.,Nor prayer nor fasting availed the plan
990,THE PREACHER.,To honor God through the wrong of man.
991,THE PREACHER.,Of all his labors no trace remains
992,THE PREACHER.,Save the bondman lifting his hands in chains.
993,THE PREACHER.,The woof he wove in the righteous warp
994,THE PREACHER.,"Of freedom-loving Oglethorpe,"
995,THE PREACHER.,"Clothes with curses the goodly land,"
996,THE PREACHER.,Changes its greenness and bloom to sand;
997,THE PREACHER.,And a century's lapse reveals once more
998,THE PREACHER.,The slave-ship stealing to Georgia's shore.
999,THE PREACHER.,Father of Light! how blind is he
1000,THE PREACHER.,Who sprinkles the altar he rears to Thee
1001,THE PREACHER.,With the blood and tears of humanity!
1002,THE PREACHER.,
1003,THE PREACHER.,He erred: shall we count His gifts as naught?
1004,THE PREACHER.,Was the work of God in him unwrought?
1005,THE PREACHER.,"The servant may through his deafness err,"
1006,THE PREACHER.,And blind may be God's messenger;
1007,THE PREACHER.,"But the Errand is sure they go upon,--"
1008,THE PREACHER.,"The word is spoken, the deed is done."
1009,THE PREACHER.,Was the Hebrew temple less fair and good
1010,THE PREACHER.,That Solomon bowed to gods of wood?
1011,THE PREACHER.,"For his tempted heart and wandering feet,"
1012,THE PREACHER.,Were the songs of David less pure and sweet?
1013,THE PREACHER.,"So in light and shadow the preacher went,"
1014,THE PREACHER.,God's erring and human instrument;
1015,THE PREACHER.,And the hearts of the people where he passed
1016,THE PREACHER.,"Swayed as the reeds sway in the blast,"
1017,THE PREACHER.,Under the spell of a voice which took
1018,THE PREACHER.,"In its compass the flow of Siloa's brook,"
1019,THE PREACHER.,And the mystical chime of the bells of gold
1020,THE PREACHER.,"On the ephod's hem of the priest of old,--"
1021,THE PREACHER.,"Now the roll of thunder, and now the awe"
1022,THE PREACHER.,Of the trumpet heard in the Mount of Law.
1023,THE PREACHER.,
1024,THE PREACHER.,A solemn fear on the listening crowd
1025,THE PREACHER.,Fell like the shadow of a cloud.
1026,THE PREACHER.,The sailor reeling from out the ships
1027,THE PREACHER.,Whose masts stood thick in the river-slips
1028,THE PREACHER.,Felt the jest and the curse die on his lips.
1029,THE PREACHER.,"Listened the fisherman rude and hard,"
1030,THE PREACHER.,The calker rough from the builder's yard;
1031,THE PREACHER.,"The man of the market left his load,"
1032,THE PREACHER.,"The teamster leaned on his bending goad,"
1033,THE PREACHER.,"The maiden, and youth beside her, felt"
1034,THE PREACHER.,"Their hearts in a closer union melt,"
1035,THE PREACHER.,And saw the flowers of their love in bloom
1036,THE PREACHER.,Down the endless vistas of life to come.
1037,THE PREACHER.,Old age sat feebly brushing away
1038,THE PREACHER.,From his ears the scanty locks of gray;
1039,THE PREACHER.,"And careless boyhood, living the free"
1040,THE PREACHER.,"Unconscious life of bird and tree,"
1041,THE PREACHER.,Suddenly wakened to a sense
1042,THE PREACHER.,Of sin and its guilty consequence.
1043,THE PREACHER.,It was as if an angel's voice
1044,THE PREACHER.,Called the listeners up for their final choice;
1045,THE PREACHER.,As if a strong hand rent apart
1046,THE PREACHER.,"The veils of sense from soul and heart,"
1047,THE PREACHER.,Showing in light ineffable
1048,THE PREACHER.,The joys of heaven and woes of hell
1049,THE PREACHER.,All about in the misty air
1050,THE PREACHER.,The hills seemed kneeling in silent prayer;
1051,THE PREACHER.,"The rustle of leaves, the moaning sedge,"
1052,THE PREACHER.,"The water's lap on its gravelled edge,"
1053,THE PREACHER.,"The wailing pines, and, far and faint,"
1054,THE PREACHER.,"The wood-dove's note of sad complaint,--"
1055,THE PREACHER.,To the solemn voice of the preacher lent
1056,THE PREACHER.,An undertone as of low lament;
1057,THE PREACHER.,"And the note of the sea from its sand coast,"
1058,THE PREACHER.,"On the easterly wind, now heard, now lost,"
1059,THE PREACHER.,Seemed the murmurous sound of the judgment host.
1060,THE PREACHER.,
1061,THE PREACHER.,"Yet wise men doubted, and good men wept,"
1062,THE PREACHER.,"As that storm of passion above them swept,"
1063,THE PREACHER.,"And, comet-like, adding flame to flame,"
1064,THE PREACHER.,"The priests of the new Evangel came,--"
1065,THE PREACHER.,"Davenport, flashing upon the crowd,"
1066,THE PREACHER.,"Charged like summer's electric cloud,"
1067,THE PREACHER.,Now holding the listener still as death
1068,THE PREACHER.,"With terrible warnings under breath,"
1069,THE PREACHER.,"Now shouting for joy, as if he viewed"
1070,THE PREACHER.,The vision of Heaven's beatitude!
1071,THE PREACHER.,"And Celtic Tennant, his long coat bound"
1072,THE PREACHER.,"Like a monk's with leathern girdle round,"
1073,THE PREACHER.,"Wild with the toss of unshorn hair,"
1074,THE PREACHER.,"And wringing of hands, and, eyes aglare,"
1075,THE PREACHER.,Groaning under the world's despair!
1076,THE PREACHER.,"Grave pastors, grieving their flocks to lose,"
1077,THE PREACHER.,Prophesied to the empty pews
1078,THE PREACHER.,"That gourds would wither, and mushrooms die,"
1079,THE PREACHER.,"And noisiest fountains run soonest dry,"
1080,THE PREACHER.,"Like the spring that gushed in Newbury Street,"
1081,THE PREACHER.,"Under the tramp of the earthquake's feet,"
1082,THE PREACHER.,"A silver shaft in the air and light,"
1083,THE PREACHER.,"For a single day, then lost in night,"
1084,THE PREACHER.,"Leaving only, its place to tell,"
1085,THE PREACHER.,Sandy fissure and sulphurous smell.
1086,THE PREACHER.,"With zeal wing-clipped and white-heat cool,"
1087,THE PREACHER.,"Moved by the spirit in grooves of rule,"
1088,THE PREACHER.,"No longer harried, and cropped, and fleeced,"
1089,THE PREACHER.,"Flogged by sheriff and cursed by priest,"
1090,THE PREACHER.,But by wiser counsels left at ease
1091,THE PREACHER.,"To settle quietly on his lees,"
1092,THE PREACHER.,"And, self-concentred, to count as done"
1093,THE PREACHER.,"The work which his fathers well begun,"
1094,THE PREACHER.,"In silent protest of letting alone,"
1095,THE PREACHER.,"The Quaker kept the way of his own,--"
1096,THE PREACHER.,"A non-conductor among the wires,"
1097,THE PREACHER.,With coat of asbestos proof to fires.
1098,THE PREACHER.,And quite unable to mend his pace
1099,THE PREACHER.,"To catch the falling manna of grace,"
1100,THE PREACHER.,He hugged the closer his little store
1101,THE PREACHER.,"Of faith, and silently prayed for more."
1102,THE PREACHER.,"And vague of creed and barren of rite,"
1103,THE PREACHER.,"But holding, as in his Master's sight,"
1104,THE PREACHER.,"Act and thought to the inner light,"
1105,THE PREACHER.,"The round of his simple duties walked,"
1106,THE PREACHER.,And strove to live what the others talked.
1107,THE PREACHER.,
1108,THE PREACHER.,And who shall marvel if evil went
1109,THE PREACHER.,"Step by step with the good intent,"
1110,THE PREACHER.,"And with love and meekness, side by side,"
1111,THE PREACHER.,Lust of the flesh and spiritual pride?--
1112,THE PREACHER.,That passionate longings and fancies vain
1113,THE PREACHER.,Set the heart on fire and crazed the brain?
1114,THE PREACHER.,That over the holy oracles
1115,THE PREACHER.,Folly sported with cap and bells?
1116,THE PREACHER.,That goodly women and learned men
1117,THE PREACHER.,Marvelling told with tongue and pen
1118,THE PREACHER.,How unweaned children chirped like birds
1119,THE PREACHER.,"Texts of Scripture and solemn words,"
1120,THE PREACHER.,Like the infant seers of the rocky glens
1121,THE PREACHER.,In the Puy de Dome of wild Cevennes
1122,THE PREACHER.,Or baby Lamas who pray and preach
1123,THE PREACHER.,From Tartir cradles in Buddha's speech?
1124,THE PREACHER.,
1125,THE PREACHER.,In the war which Truth or Freedom wages
1126,THE PREACHER.,"With impious fraud and the wrong of ages,"
1127,THE PREACHER.,Hate and malice and self-love mar
1128,THE PREACHER.,"The notes of triumph with painful jar,"
1129,THE PREACHER.,And the helping angels turn aside
1130,THE PREACHER.,Their sorrowing faces the shame to bide.
1131,THE PREACHER.,Never on custom's oiled grooves
1132,THE PREACHER.,"The world to a higher level moves,"
1133,THE PREACHER.,But grates and grinds with friction hard
1134,THE PREACHER.,On granite boulder and flinty shard.
1135,THE PREACHER.,"The heart must bleed before it feels,"
1136,THE PREACHER.,The pool be troubled before it heals;
1137,THE PREACHER.,"Ever by losses the right must gain,"
1138,THE PREACHER.,Every good have its birth of pain;
1139,THE PREACHER.,The active Virtues blush to find
1140,THE PREACHER.,"The Vices wearing their badge behind,"
1141,THE PREACHER.,And Graces and Charities feel the fire
1142,THE PREACHER.,Wherein the sins of the age expire;
1143,THE PREACHER.,The fiend still rends as of old he rent
1144,THE PREACHER.,The tortured body from which be went.
1145,THE PREACHER.,
1146,THE PREACHER.,But Time tests all. In the over-drift
1147,THE PREACHER.,"And flow of the Nile, with its annual gift,"
1148,THE PREACHER.,Who cares for the Hadji's relics sunk?
1149,THE PREACHER.,Who thinks of the drowned-out Coptic monk?
1150,THE PREACHER.,"The tide that loosens the temple's stones,"
1151,THE PREACHER.,"And scatters the sacred ibis-bones,"
1152,THE PREACHER.,Drives away from the valley-land
1153,THE PREACHER.,"That Arab robber, the wandering sand,"
1154,THE PREACHER.,"Moistens the fields that know no rain,"
1155,THE PREACHER.,"Fringes the desert with belts of grain,"
1156,THE PREACHER.,And bread to the sower brings again.
1157,THE PREACHER.,So the flood of emotion deep and strong
1158,THE PREACHER.,"Troubled the land as it swept along,"
1159,THE PREACHER.,"But left a result of holier lives,"
1160,THE PREACHER.,Tenderer-mothers and worthier wives.
1161,THE PREACHER.,The husband and father whose children fled
1162,THE PREACHER.,And sad wife wept when his drunken tread
1163,THE PREACHER.,"Frightened peace from his roof-tree's shade,"
1164,THE PREACHER.,"And a rock of offence his hearthstone made,"
1165,THE PREACHER.,In a strength that was not his own began
1166,THE PREACHER.,To rise from the brute's to the plane of man.
1167,THE PREACHER.,"Old friends embraced, long held apart"
1168,THE PREACHER.,By evil counsel and pride of heart;
1169,THE PREACHER.,"And penitence saw through misty tears,"
1170,THE PREACHER.,"In the bow of hope on its cloud of fears,"
1171,THE PREACHER.,"The promise of Heaven's eternal years,--"
1172,THE PREACHER.,"The peace of God for the world's annoy,--"
1173,THE PREACHER.,"Beauty for ashes, and oil of joy"
1174,THE PREACHER.,"Under the church of Federal Street,"
1175,THE PREACHER.,"Under the tread of its Sabbath feet,"
1176,THE PREACHER.,"Walled about by its basement stones,"
1177,THE PREACHER.,Lie the marvellous preacher's bones.
1178,THE PREACHER.,"No saintly honors to them are shown,"
1179,THE PREACHER.,No sign nor miracle have they known;
1180,THE PREACHER.,But be who passes the ancient church
1181,THE PREACHER.,"Stops in the shade of its belfry-porch,"

1892,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,Of the great sea comes the monotonous roar
1893,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"Of the long-breaking surf, and all the sky"
1894,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"Is gray with cloud, home-bound and dull, I try"
1895,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,To time a simple legend to the sounds
1896,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"Of winds in the woods, and waves on pebbled bounds,--"
1897,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"A song for oars to chime with, such as might"
1898,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"Be sung by tired sea-painters, who at night"
1899,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"Look from their hemlock camps, by quiet cove"
1900,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"Or beach, moon-lighted, on the waves they love."
1901,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"(So hast thou looked, when level sunset lay"

1903,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,And all the spray-moist rocks and waves that rolled
1904,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,Up the white sand-slopes flashed with ruddy gold.)
1905,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"Something it has--a flavor of the sea,"
1906,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,And the sea's freedom--which reminds of thee.
1907,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"Its faded picture, dimly smiling down"
1908,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"From the blurred fresco of the ancient town,"
1909,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"I have not touched with warmer tints in vain,"
1910,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"If, in this dark, sad year, it steals one thought"

1925,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,
1926,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,Her heart is like an outbound ship
1927,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,That at its anchor swings;

1930,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,
1931,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,"She sings, and, smiling, hears her praise,"
1932,TO WILLIAM BRADFORD.,But dreams the while of one

2011,TO E. W.,TO E. W.
2012,TO E. W.,
2013,TO E. W.,"I inscribed this poem to Dr. Elias Weld of Haverhill, Massachusetts,"
2014,TO E. W.,to whose kindness I was much indebted in my boyhood. He was the one
2015,TO E. W.,cultivated man in the neighborhood. His small but well-chosen library
2016,TO E. W.,"was placed at my disposal. He is the ""wise old doctor"" of Snow-Bound."
2017,TO E. W.,Count Francois de Vipart with his cousin Joseph Rochemont de Poyen came
2018,TO E. W.,to the United States in the early part of the present century. They took
2019,TO E. W.,"up their residence at Rocks Village on the Merrimac, where they both"
2020,TO E. W.,"married. The wife of Count Vipart was Mary Ingalls, who as my father"
2021,TO E. W.,"remembered her was a very lovely young girl. Her wedding dress, as"
2022,TO E. W.,"described by a lady still living, was ""pink satin with an overdress of"
2023,TO E. W.,"white lace, and white satin slippers."" She died in less than a year"
2024,TO E. W.,after her marriage. Her husband returned to his native country. He lies
2025,TO E. W.,buried in the family tomb of the Viparts at Bordeaux.
2026,TO E. W.,
2027,TO E. W.,"I KNOW not, Time and Space so intervene,"
2028,TO E. W.,"Whether, still waiting with a trust serene,"
2029,TO E. W.,"Thou bearest up thy fourscore years and ten,"
2030,TO E. W.,"Or, called at last, art now Heaven's citizen;"
2031,TO E. W.,"But, here or there, a pleasant thought of thee,"
2032,TO E. W.,"Like an old friend, all day has been with me."
2033,TO E. W.,"The shy, still boy, for whom thy kindly hand"
2034,TO E. W.,Smoothed his hard pathway to the wonder-land
2035,TO E. W.,"Of thought and fancy, in gray manhood yet"
2036,TO E. W.,Keeps green the memory of his early debt.
2037,TO E. W.,"To-day, when truth and falsehood speak their words"
2038,TO E. W.,"Through hot-lipped cannon and the teeth of swords,"
2039,TO E. W.,Listening with quickened heart and ear intent
2040,TO E. W.,"To each sharp clause of that stern argument,"
2041,TO E. W.,I still can hear at times a softer note
2042,TO E. W.,"Of the old pastoral music round me float,"
2043,TO E. W.,While through the hot gleam of our civil strife
2044,TO E. W.,Looms the green mirage of a simpler life.
2045,TO E. W.,"As, at his alien post, the sentinel"
2046,TO E. W.,"Drops the old bucket in the homestead well,"
2047,TO E. W.,And hears old voices in the winds that toss
2048,TO E. W.,"Above his head the live-oak's beard of moss,"
2049,TO E. W.,"So, in our trial-time, and under skies"
2050,TO E. W.,"Shadowed by swords like Islam's paradise,"
2051,TO E. W.,"I wait and watch, and let my fancy stray"
2052,TO E. W.,To milder scenes and youth's Arcadian day;
2053,TO E. W.,And howsoe'er the pencil dipped in dreams
2054,TO E. W.,"Shades the brown woods or tints the sunset streams,"
2055,TO E. W.,"The country doctor in the foreground seems,"
2056,TO E. W.,Whose ancient sulky down the village lanes
2057,TO E. W.,"Dragged, like a war-car, captive ills and pains."
2058,TO E. W.,"I could not paint the scenery of my song,"
2059,TO E. W.,Mindless of one who looked thereon so long;
2060,TO E. W.,"Who, night and day, on duty's lonely round,"
2061,TO E. W.,"Made friends o' the woods and rocks, and knew the sound"
2062,TO E. W.,"Of each small brook, and what the hillside trees"
2063,TO E. W.,Said to the winds that touched their leafy keys;
2064,TO E. W.,Who saw so keenly and so well could paint
2065,TO E. W.,"The village-folk, with all their humors quaint,"
2066,TO E. W.,The parson ambling on his wall-eyed roan.
2067,TO E. W.,"Grave and erect, with white hair backward blown;"

2070,TO E. W.,"And the loud straggler levying his blackmail,--"
2071,TO E. W.,"Old customs, habits, superstitions, fears,"
2072,TO E. W.,All that lies buried under fifty years.
2073,TO E. W.,"To thee, as is most fit, I bring my lay,"

2082,TO E. W.,
2083,TO E. W.,"You catch a glimpse, through birch and pine,"
2084,TO E. W.,"Of gable, roof, and porch,"
2085,TO E. W.,"The tavern with its swinging sign,"
2086,TO E. W.,The sharp horn of the church.
2087,TO E. W.,
2088,TO E. W.,The river's steel-blue crescent curves
2089,TO E. W.,"To meet, in ebb and flow,"
2090,TO E. W.,The single broken wharf that serves
2091,TO E. W.,For sloop and gundelow.
2092,TO E. W.,
2093,TO E. W.,With salt sea-scents along its shores
2094,TO E. W.,"The heavy hay-boats crawl,"
2095,TO E. W.,The long antennae of their oars
2096,TO E. W.,In lazy rise and fall.
2097,TO E. W.,
2098,TO E. W.,Along the gray abutment's wall
2099,TO E. W.,The idle shad-net dries;
2100,TO E. W.,The toll-man in his cobbler's stall
2101,TO E. W.,Sits smoking with closed eyes.
2102,TO E. W.,
2103,TO E. W.,You hear the pier's low undertone
2104,TO E. W.,Of waves that chafe and gnaw;
2105,TO E. W.,"You start,--a skipper's horn is blown"
2106,TO E. W.,To raise the creaking draw.
2107,TO E. W.,
2108,TO E. W.,At times a blacksmith's anvil sounds
2109,TO E. W.,"With slow and sluggard beat,"
2110,TO E. W.,Or stage-coach on its dusty rounds
2111,TO E. W.,Fakes up the staring street.
2112,TO E. W.,
2113,TO E. W.,"A place for idle eyes and ears,"
2114,TO E. W.,A cobwebbed nook of dreams;
2115,TO E. W.,Left by the stream whose waves are years
2116,TO E. W.,The stranded village seems.
2117,TO E. W.,
2118,TO E. W.,"And there, like other moss and rust,"
2119,TO E. W.,"The native dweller clings,"
2120,TO E. W.,"And keeps, in uninquiring trust,"
2121,TO E. W.,"The old, dull round of things."
2122,TO E. W.,
2123,TO E. W.,"The fisher drops his patient lines,"
2124,TO E. W.,"The farmer sows his grain,"

2128,TO E. W.,"Go where, along the tangled steep"
2129,TO E. W.,"That slopes against the west,"
2130,TO E. W.,The hamlet's buried idlers sleep
2131,TO E. W.,In still profounder rest.
2132,TO E. W.,
2133,TO E. W.,"Throw back the locust's flowery plume,"
2134,TO E. W.,"The birch's pale-green scarf,"
2135,TO E. W.,And break the web of brier and bloom
2136,TO E. W.,From name and epitaph.
2137,TO E. W.,
2138,TO E. W.,"A simple muster-roll of death,"
2139,TO E. W.,"Of pomp and romance shorn,"
2140,TO E. W.,"The dry, old names that common breath"
2141,TO E. W.,Has cheapened and outworn.
2142,TO E. W.,
2143,TO E. W.,"Yet pause by one low mound, and part"
2144,TO E. W.,"The wild vines o'er it laced,"
2145,TO E. W.,And read the words by rustic art
2146,TO E. W.,Upon its headstone traced.
2147,TO E. W.,
2148,TO E. W.,Haply yon white-haired villager
2149,TO E. W.,Of fourscore years can say
2150,TO E. W.,What means the noble name of her
2151,TO E. W.,Who sleeps with common clay.
2152,TO E. W.,
2153,TO E. W.,An exile from the Gascon land
2154,TO E. W.,"Found refuge here and rest,"
2155,TO E. W.,"And loved, of all the village band,"
2156,TO E. W.,Its fairest and its best.
2157,TO E. W.,
2158,TO E. W.,"He knelt with her on Sabbath morns,"
2159,TO E. W.,"He worshipped through her eyes,"
2160,TO E. W.,And on the pride that doubts and scorns
2161,TO E. W.,Stole in her faith's surprise.
2162,TO E. W.,
2163,TO E. W.,Her simple daily life he saw
2164,TO E. W.,"By homeliest duties tried,"
2165,TO E. W.,In all things by an untaught law
2166,TO E. W.,Of fitness justified.
2167,TO E. W.,
2168,TO E. W.,For her his rank aside he laid;
2169,TO E. W.,He took the hue and tone
2170,TO E. W.,"Of lowly life and toil, and made"
2171,TO E. W.,Her simple ways his own.
2172,TO E. W.,
2173,TO E. W.,"Yet still, in gay and careless ease,"
2174,TO E. W.,To harvest-field or dance
2175,TO E. W.,"He brought the gentle courtesies,"

2177,TO E. W.,
2178,TO E. W.,And she who taught him love not less
2179,TO E. W.,From him she loved in turn
2180,TO E. W.,Caught in her sweet unconsciousness
2181,TO E. W.,What love is quick to learn.
2182,TO E. W.,
2183,TO E. W.,"Each grew to each in pleased accord,"
2184,TO E. W.,Nor knew the gazing town

2225,TO E. W.,A sweetness which is all thy own
2226,TO E. W.,Breathes out from fern and brake.
