48,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,
49,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,THE beginning of German emigration to America may be traced to the
50,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"personal influence of William Penn, who in 1677 visited the Continent,"
51,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,and made the acquaintance of an intelligent and highly cultivated circle
52,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"of Pietists, or Mystics, who, reviving in the seventeenth century the"
53,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"spiritual faith and worship of Tauler and the ""Friends of God"" in the"
54,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"fourteenth, gathered about the pastor Spener, and the young and"
55,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,beautiful Eleonora Johanna Von Merlau. In this circle originated the
56,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Frankfort Land Company, which bought of William Penn, the Governor of"
57,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Pennsylvania, a tract of land near the new city of Philadelphia. The"
58,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"company's agent in the New World was a rising young lawyer, Francis"
59,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Daniel Pastorius, son of Judge Pastorius, of Windsheim, who, at the age"
60,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"of seventeen, entered the University of Altorf. He studied law at,"
61,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Strasburg, Basle, and Jena, and at Ratisbon, the seat of the Imperial"
62,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Government, obtained a practical knowledge of international polity."
63,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Successful in all his examinations and disputations, he received the"
64,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,degree of Doctor of Law at Nuremberg in 1676. In 1679 he was a
65,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"law-lecturer at Frankfort, where he became deeply interested in the"
66,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"teachings of Dr. Spener. In 1680-81 he travelled in France, England,"
67,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Ireland, and Italy with his friend Herr Von Rodeck. ""I was,"" he says,"
68,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"""glad to enjoy again the company of my Christian friends, rather than be"
69,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"with Von Rodeck feasting and dancing."" In 1683, in company with a small"
70,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"number of German Friends, he emigrated to America, settling upon the"
71,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,Frankfort Company's tract between the Schuylkill and the Delaware
72,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"rivers. The township was divided into four hamlets, namely, Germantown,"
73,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Krisheim, Crefield, and Sommerhausen. Soon after his arrival he united"
74,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"himself with the Society of Friends, and became one of its most able and"
75,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"devoted members, as well as the recognized head and lawgiver of the"
76,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"settlement. He married, two years after his arrival, Anneke (Anna),"
77,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"daughter of Dr. Klosterman, of Muhlheim. In the year 1688 he drew up a"
78,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"memorial against slaveholding, which was adopted by the Germantown"
79,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Friends and sent up to the Monthly Meeting, and thence to the Yearly"
80,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,Meeting at Philadelphia. It is noteworthy as the first protest made by
81,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,a religious body against Negro Slavery. The original document was
82,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"discovered in 1844 by the Philadelphia antiquarian, Nathan Kite, and"
83,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,published in The Friend (Vol. XVIII. No. 16). It is a bold and direct
84,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"appeal to the best instincts of the heart. ""Have not,"" he asks, ""these"
85,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,negroes as much right to fight for their freedom as you have to keep
86,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"them slaves?"" Under the wise direction of Pastorius, the German-town"
87,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,settlement grew and prospered. The inhabitants planted orchards and
88,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"vineyards, and surrounded themselves with souvenirs of their old home."
89,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"A large number of them were linen-weavers, as well as small farmers."
90,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"The Quakers were the principal sect, but men of all religions were"
91,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"tolerated, and lived together in harmony. In 1692 Richard Frame"
92,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"published, in what he called verse, a Description of Pennsylvania, in"
93,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,which he alludes to the settlement:--
94,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,
95,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"""The German town of which I spoke before,"
96,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Which is at least in length one mile or more,"
97,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Where lives High German people and Low Dutch,"
98,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Whose trade in weaving linen cloth is much,"
99,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"--There grows the flax, as also you may know"
100,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,That from the same they do divide the tow.
101,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Their trade suits well their habitation,"
102,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"We find convenience for their occupation."""
103,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,
104,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Pastorius seems to have been on intimate terms with William Penn, Thomas"
105,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Lloyd, Chief Justice Logan, Thomas Story, and other leading men in the"
106,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Province belonging to his own religious society, as also with Kelpius,"
107,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"the learned Mystic of the Wissahickon, with the pastor of the Swedes'"
108,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"church, and the leaders of the Mennonites. He wrote a description of"
109,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Pennsylvania, which was published at Frankfort and Leipsic in 1700 and"
110,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"1701. His Lives of the Saints, etc., written in German and dedicated to"
111,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Professor Schurmberg, his old teacher, was published in 1690. He left"
112,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,behind him many unpublished manuscripts covering a very wide range of
113,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"subjects, most of which are now lost. One huge manuscript folio,"
114,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"entitled Hive Beestock, Melliotropheum Alucar, or Rusca Apium, still"
115,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"remains, containing one thousand pages with about one hundred lines to a"
116,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"page. It is a medley of knowledge and fancy, history, philosophy, and"
117,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"poetry, written in seven languages. A large portion of his poetry is"
118,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"devoted to the pleasures of gardening, the description of flowers, and"
119,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,the care of bees. The following specimen of his punning Latin is
120,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,addressed to an orchard-pilferer:--
121,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,
122,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"""Quisquis in haec furtim reptas viridaria nostra"
123,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Tangere fallaci poma caveto mane,"
124,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Si non obsequeris faxit Deus omne quod opto,"
125,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Cum malis nostris ut mala cuncta feras."""
126,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,
127,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Professor Oswald Seidensticker, to whose papers in Der Deutsche Pioneer"
128,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"and that able periodical the Penn Monthly, of Philadelphia, I am"
129,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,indebted for many of the foregoing facts in regard to the German
130,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"pilgrims of the New World, thus closes his notice of Pastorius:--"
131,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"""No tombstone, not even a record of burial, indicates where his remains"
132,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"have found their last resting-place, and the pardonable desire to"
133,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,associate the homage due to this distinguished man with some visible
134,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,memento can not be gratified. There is no reason to suppose that he was
135,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,interred in any other place than the Friends' old burying-ground in
136,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Germantown, though the fact is not attested by any definite source of"
137,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"information. After all, this obliteration of the last trace of his"
138,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,earthly existence is but typical of what has overtaken the times which
139,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"he represents; that Germantown which he founded, which saw him live and"
140,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"move, is at present but a quaint idyl of the past, almost a myth, barely"
141,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,remembered and little cared for by the keener race that has succeeded.
142,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,The Pilgrims of Plymouth have not lacked historian and poet. Justice has
143,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"been done to their faith, courage, and self-sacrifice, and to the mighty"
144,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,influence of their endeavors to establish righteousness on the earth.
145,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"The Quaker pilgrims of Pennsylvania, seeking the same object by"
146,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"different means, have not been equally fortunate. The power of their"
147,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"testimony for truth and holiness, peace and freedom, enforced only by"
148,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"what Milton calls ""the unresistible might of meekness,"" has been felt"
149,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"through two centuries in the amelioration of penal severities, the"
150,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"abolition of slavery, the reform of the erring, the relief of the poor"
151,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"and suffering,--felt, in brief, in every step of human progress. But of"
152,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"the men themselves, with the single exception of William Penn, scarcely"
153,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"anything is known. Contrasted, from the outset, with the stern,"
154,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"aggressive Puritans of New England, they have come to be regarded as"
155,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"""a feeble folk,"" with a personality as doubtful as their unrecorded"
156,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"graves. They were not soldiers, like Miles Standish; they had no figure"
157,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"so picturesque as Vane, no leader so rashly brave and haughty as"
158,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,Endicott. No Cotton Mather wrote their Magnalia; they had no awful drama
159,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,of supernaturalism in which Satan and his angels were actors; and the
160,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,only witch mentioned in their simple annals was a poor old Swedish
161,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"woman, who, on complaint of her countrywomen, was tried and acquitted"
162,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,of everything but imbecility and folly. Nothing but common-place offices
163,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"of civility came to pass between them and the Indians; indeed, their"
164,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,enemies taunted them with the fact that the savages did not regard them
165,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"as Christians, but just such men as themselves. Yet it must be apparent"
166,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,to every careful observer of the progress of American civilization that
167,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,its two principal currents had their sources in the entirely opposite
168,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,directions of the Puritan and Quaker colonies. To use the words of a
169,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"late writer: [1] ""The historical forces, with which no others may be"
170,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"compared in their influence on the people, have been those of the"
171,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,Puritan and the Quaker. The strength of the one was in the confession of
172,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"an invisible Presence, a righteous, eternal Will, which would establish"
173,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,righteousness on earth; and thence arose the conviction of a direct
174,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"personal responsibility, which could be tempted by no external splendor"
175,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"and could be shaken by no internal agitation, and could not be evaded or"
176,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,transferred. The strength of the other was the witness in the human
177,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"spirit to an eternal Word, an Inner Voice which spoke to each alone,"
178,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"while yet it spoke to every man; a Light which each was to follow, and"
179,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,which yet was the light of the world; and all other voices were silent
180,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"before this, and the solitary path whither it led was more sacred than"
181,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"the worn ways of cathedral-aisles."" It will be sufficiently apparent to"
182,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"the reader that, in the poem which follows, I have attempted nothing"
183,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"beyond a study of the life and times of the Pennsylvania colonist,--a"
184,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,simple picture of a noteworthy man and his locality. The colors of my
185,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"sketch are all very sober, toned down to the quiet and dreamy atmosphere"
186,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"through which its subject is visible. Whether, in the glare and tumult"
187,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"of the present time, such a picture will find favor may well be"
188,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,questioned. I only know that it has beguiled for me some hours of
189,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"weariness, and that, whatever may be its measure of public appreciation,"
190,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"it has been to me its own reward."""

234,PRELUDE.,"Through whose veiled, mystic faith the Inward Light,"

248,PRELUDE.,Along the wedded rivers. One long bar
249,PRELUDE.,"Of purple cloud, on which the evening star"
250,PRELUDE.,"Shone like a jewel on a scimitar,"
251,PRELUDE.,
252,PRELUDE.,Held the sky's golden gateway. Through the deep
253,PRELUDE.,"Hush of the woods a murmur seemed to creep,"
254,PRELUDE.,The Schuylkill whispering in a voice of sleep.
255,PRELUDE.,
256,PRELUDE.,All else was still. The oxen from their ploughs
257,PRELUDE.,"Rested at last, and from their long day's browse"

262,PRELUDE.,"Marked by the smoke of evening fires alone,"
263,PRELUDE.,
264,PRELUDE.,"Lay in the distance, lovely even then"

268,PRELUDE.,Urban yet sylvan; in its rough-hewn frames
269,PRELUDE.,"Of oak and pine the dryads held their claims,"

271,PRELUDE.,
272,PRELUDE.,Anna Pastorius down the leafy lane

279,PRELUDE.,
280,PRELUDE.,"Again she looked: between green walls of shade,"
281,PRELUDE.,"With low-bent head as if with sorrow weighed,"
282,PRELUDE.,"Daniel Pastorius slowly came and said,"
283,PRELUDE.,
284,PRELUDE.,"""God's peace be with thee, Anna!"" Then he stood"
285,PRELUDE.,"Silent before her, wrestling with the mood"
286,PRELUDE.,Of one who sees the evil and not good.
287,PRELUDE.,
288,PRELUDE.,"""What is it, my Pastorius?"" As she spoke,"
289,PRELUDE.,"A slow, faint smile across his features broke,"
290,PRELUDE.,"Sadder than tears. ""Dear heart,"" he said, ""our folk"
291,PRELUDE.,
292,PRELUDE.,"""Are even as others. Yea, our goodliest Friends"

296,PRELUDE.,"""For duty's loss. So even our feeble word"
297,PRELUDE.,For the dumb slaves the startled meeting heard
298,PRELUDE.,As if a stone its quiet waters stirred;
299,PRELUDE.,
300,PRELUDE.,"""And, as the clerk ceased reading, there began"
301,PRELUDE.,A ripple of dissent which downward ran
302,PRELUDE.,"In widening circles, as from man to man."
303,PRELUDE.,
304,PRELUDE.,"""Somewhat was said of running before sent,"
305,PRELUDE.,"Of tender fear that some their guide outwent,"
306,PRELUDE.,Troublers of Israel. I was scarce intent
307,PRELUDE.,
308,PRELUDE.,"""On hearing, for behind the reverend row"
309,PRELUDE.,"Of gallery Friends, in dumb and piteous show,"
310,PRELUDE.,"I saw, methought, dark faces full of woe."
311,PRELUDE.,
312,PRELUDE.,"""And, in the spirit, I was taken where"
313,PRELUDE.,They toiled and suffered; I was made aware
314,PRELUDE.,Of shame and wrath and anguish and despair!
315,PRELUDE.,
316,PRELUDE.,"""And while the meeting smothered our poor plea"
317,PRELUDE.,"With cautious phrase, a Voice there seemed to be,"
318,PRELUDE.,As ye have done to these ye do to me!'
319,PRELUDE.,
320,PRELUDE.,"""So it all passed; and the old tithe went on"

328,PRELUDE.,"He ceased; and, bound in spirit with the bound,"
329,PRELUDE.,"With folded arms, and eyes that sought the ground,"
330,PRELUDE.,Walked musingly his little garden round.
331,PRELUDE.,
332,PRELUDE.,"About him, beaded with the falling dew,"
333,PRELUDE.,"Rare plants of power and herbs of healing grew,"
334,PRELUDE.,Such as Van Helmont and Agrippa knew.
335,PRELUDE.,
336,PRELUDE.,"For, by the lore of Gorlitz' gentle sage,"
337,PRELUDE.,With the mild mystics of his dreamy age
338,PRELUDE.,"He read the herbal signs of nature's page,"
339,PRELUDE.,
340,PRELUDE.,As once he heard in sweet Von Merlau's' bowers
341,PRELUDE.,"Fair as herself, in boyhood's happy hours,"

348,PRELUDE.,"Or Carib spear, a gift to William Penn"
349,PRELUDE.,"From the rare gardens of John Evelyn,"
350,PRELUDE.,Brought from the Spanish Main by merchantmen.
351,PRELUDE.,
352,PRELUDE.,"""See this strange plant its steady purpose hold,"
353,PRELUDE.,"And, year by year, its patient leaves unfold,"
354,PRELUDE.,Till the young eyes that watched it first are old.
355,PRELUDE.,
356,PRELUDE.,"""But some time, thou hast told me, there shall come"
357,PRELUDE.,"A sudden beauty, brightness, and perfume,"
358,PRELUDE.,The century-moulded bud shall burst in bloom.
359,PRELUDE.,
360,PRELUDE.,"""So may the seed which hath been sown to-day"

362,PRELUDE.,"Break into bloom, and God's eternal Yea!"
363,PRELUDE.,
364,PRELUDE.,"""Answer at last the patient prayers of them"
365,PRELUDE.,"Who now, by faith alone, behold its stem"
366,PRELUDE.,Crowned with the flowers of Freedom's diadem.
367,PRELUDE.,
368,PRELUDE.,"""Meanwhile, to feel and suffer, work and wait,"

372,PRELUDE.,"""Well hast thou said, my Anna!"" Tenderer"

376,PRELUDE.,"""Because the vision tarrieth? In an hour"

392,PRELUDE.,On the stone hearth the blazing walnut block

394,PRELUDE.,"Rebuking Peter on the Van Wyck clock,"
395,PRELUDE.,
396,PRELUDE.,"Shone on old tomes of law and physic, side"

403,PRELUDE.,
404,PRELUDE.,"The courtly Penn had praised the goodwife's cheer,"

407,PRELUDE.,
408,PRELUDE.,"In such a home, beside the Schuylkill's wave,"

410,PRELUDE.,Food to the poor and shelter to the slave.
411,PRELUDE.,
412,PRELUDE.,For all too soon the New World's scandal shamed
413,PRELUDE.,"The righteous code by Penn and Sidney framed,"
414,PRELUDE.,And men withheld the human rights they claimed.
415,PRELUDE.,
416,PRELUDE.,"And slowly wealth and station sanction lent,"
417,PRELUDE.,"And hardened avarice, on its gains intent,"
418,PRELUDE.,Stifled the inward whisper of dissent.
419,PRELUDE.,
420,PRELUDE.,Yet all the while the burden rested sore
421,PRELUDE.,On tender hearts. At last Pastorius bore
422,PRELUDE.,Their warning message to the Church's door

424,PRELUDE.,In God's name; and the leaven of the word
425,PRELUDE.,"Wrought ever after in the souls who heard,"
426,PRELUDE.,And a dead conscience in its grave-clothes stirred
427,PRELUDE.,
428,PRELUDE.,"To troubled life, and urged the vain excuse"

447,PRELUDE.,
448,PRELUDE.,How felt the Master when his chosen strove
449,PRELUDE.,In childish folly for their seats above;
450,PRELUDE.,"And that fond mother, blinded by her love,"

475,PRELUDE.,
476,PRELUDE.,There hungry folk in homespun drab and gray
477,PRELUDE.,"Drew round his board on Monthly Meeting day,"

576,PRELUDE.,"As still in Hemskerck's Quaker Meeting, [16] face"
577,PRELUDE.,"By face in Flemish detail, we may trace"
578,PRELUDE.,How loose-mouthed boor and fine ancestral grace
579,PRELUDE.,
580,PRELUDE.,"Sat in close contrast,--the clipt-headed churl,"
581,PRELUDE.,"Broad market-dame, and simple serving-girl"
582,PRELUDE.,By skirt of silk and periwig in curl
583,PRELUDE.,
584,PRELUDE.,For soul touched soul; the spiritual treasure-trove

590,PRELUDE.,Pastorius to the manners of the town
591,PRELUDE.,
592,PRELUDE.,"Added the freedom of the woods, and sought"
593,PRELUDE.,"The bookless wisdom by experience taught,"
594,PRELUDE.,"And learned to love his new-found home, while not"
595,PRELUDE.,
596,PRELUDE.,Forgetful of the old; the seasons went
597,PRELUDE.,"Their rounds, and somewhat to his spirit lent"
598,PRELUDE.,Of their own calm and measureless content.
599,PRELUDE.,
600,PRELUDE.,"Glad even to tears, he heard the robin sing"
601,PRELUDE.,"His song of welcome to the Western spring,"
602,PRELUDE.,And bluebird borrowing from the sky his wing.
603,PRELUDE.,
604,PRELUDE.,"And when the miracle of autumn came,"

608,PRELUDE.,"Burned, unconsumed, a voice without a sound"
609,PRELUDE.,"Spake to him from each kindled bush around,"
610,PRELUDE.,"And made the strange, new landscape holy ground"
611,PRELUDE.,
612,PRELUDE.,"And when the bitter north-wind, keen and swift,"
613,PRELUDE.,"Swept the white street and piled the dooryard drift,"
614,PRELUDE.,"He exercised, as Friends might say, his gift"
615,PRELUDE.,
616,PRELUDE.,"Of verse, Dutch, English, Latin, like the hash"
617,PRELUDE.,Of corn and beans in Indian succotash;
618,PRELUDE.,"Dull, doubtless, but with here and there a flash"
619,PRELUDE.,
620,PRELUDE.,"Of wit and fine conceit,--the good man's play"
621,PRELUDE.,"Of quiet fancies, meet to while away"
622,PRELUDE.,The slow hours measuring off an idle day.
623,PRELUDE.,
624,PRELUDE.,"At evening, while his wife put on her look"
625,PRELUDE.,"Of love's endurance, from its niche he took"
626,PRELUDE.,The written pages of his ponderous book.
627,PRELUDE.,
628,PRELUDE.,"And read, in half the languages of man,"
629,PRELUDE.,"His ""Rusca Apium,"" which with bees began,"
630,PRELUDE.,And through the gamut of creation ran.
631,PRELUDE.,
632,PRELUDE.,"Or, now and then, the missive of some friend"
633,PRELUDE.,In gray Altorf or storied Nurnberg penned
634,PRELUDE.,Dropped in upon him like a guest to spend
635,PRELUDE.,
636,PRELUDE.,The night beneath his roof-tree. Mystical
637,PRELUDE.,The fair Von Merlau spake as waters fall
638,PRELUDE.,"And voices sound in dreams, and yet withal"
639,PRELUDE.,
640,PRELUDE.,"Human and sweet, as if each far, low tone,"
641,PRELUDE.,Over the roses of her gardens blown
642,PRELUDE.,Brought the warm sense of beauty all her own.
643,PRELUDE.,
644,PRELUDE.,Wise Spener questioned what his friend could trace
645,PRELUDE.,Of spiritual influx or of saving grace
646,PRELUDE.,In the wild natures of the Indian race.
647,PRELUDE.,
648,PRELUDE.,"And learned Schurmberg, fain, at times, to look"
649,PRELUDE.,"From Talmud, Koran, Veds, and Pentateuch,"
650,PRELUDE.,"Sought out his pupil in his far-off nook,"
651,PRELUDE.,
652,PRELUDE.,"To query with him of climatic change,"
653,PRELUDE.,"Of bird, beast, reptile, in his forest range,"
654,PRELUDE.,Of flowers and fruits and simples new and strange.
655,PRELUDE.,
656,PRELUDE.,And thus the Old and New World reached their hands
657,PRELUDE.,"Across the water, and the friendly lands"
658,PRELUDE.,Talked with each other from their severed strands.
659,PRELUDE.,
660,PRELUDE.,Pastorius answered all: while seed and root
661,PRELUDE.,Sent from his new home grew to flower and fruit
662,PRELUDE.,Along the Rhine and at the Spessart's foot;
663,PRELUDE.,
664,PRELUDE.,"And, in return, the flowers his boyhood knew"
665,PRELUDE.,"Smiled at his door, the same in form and hue,"
666,PRELUDE.,And on his vines the Rhenish clusters grew.
667,PRELUDE.,
668,PRELUDE.,"No idler he; whoever else might shirk,"
669,PRELUDE.,"He set his hand to every honest work,--"
670,PRELUDE.,"Farmer and teacher, court and meeting clerk."
671,PRELUDE.,
672,PRELUDE.,"Still on the town seal his device is found,"
673,PRELUDE.,"Grapes, flax, and thread-spool on a trefoil ground,"
674,PRELUDE.,"With ""Vinum, Linum et Textrinum"" wound."
675,PRELUDE.,
676,PRELUDE.,"One house sufficed for gospel and for law,"
677,PRELUDE.,"Where Paul and Grotius, Scripture text and saw,"
678,PRELUDE.,"Assured the good, and held the rest in awe."
679,PRELUDE.,
680,PRELUDE.,"Whatever legal maze he wandered through,"
681,PRELUDE.,"He kept the Sermon on the Mount in view,"
682,PRELUDE.,And justice always into mercy grew.
683,PRELUDE.,
684,PRELUDE.,"No whipping-post he needed, stocks, nor jail,"
685,PRELUDE.,Nor ducking-stool; the orchard-thief grew pale
686,PRELUDE.,"At his rebuke, the vixen ceased to rail,"
687,PRELUDE.,
688,PRELUDE.,The usurer's grasp released the forfeit land;
689,PRELUDE.,"The slanderer faltered at the witness-stand,"
690,PRELUDE.,And all men took his counsel for command.
691,PRELUDE.,
692,PRELUDE.,"Was it caressing air, the brooding love"
693,PRELUDE.,"Of tenderer skies than German land knew of,"
694,PRELUDE.,"Green calm below, blue quietness above,"
695,PRELUDE.,
696,PRELUDE.,"Still flow of water, deep repose of wood"
697,PRELUDE.,"That, with a sense of loving Fatherhood"
698,PRELUDE.,"And childlike trust in the Eternal Good,"
699,PRELUDE.,
700,PRELUDE.,"Softened all hearts, and dulled the edge of hate,"
701,PRELUDE.,"Hushed strife, and taught impatient zeal to wait"
702,PRELUDE.,The slow assurance of the better state?
703,PRELUDE.,
704,PRELUDE.,Who knows what goadings in their sterner way
705,PRELUDE.,"O'er jagged ice, relieved by granite gray,"
706,PRELUDE.,Blew round the men of Massachusetts Bay?
707,PRELUDE.,
708,PRELUDE.,What hate of heresy the east-wind woke?
709,PRELUDE.,What hints of pitiless power and terror spoke
710,PRELUDE.,In waves that on their iron coast-line broke?
711,PRELUDE.,
712,PRELUDE.,Be it as it may: within the Land of Penn
713,PRELUDE.,"The sectary yielded to the citizen,"
714,PRELUDE.,And peaceful dwelt the many-creeded men.
715,PRELUDE.,
716,PRELUDE.,Peace brooded over all. No trumpet stung
717,PRELUDE.,"The air to madness, and no steeple flung"
718,PRELUDE.,Alarums down from bells at midnight rung.
719,PRELUDE.,
720,PRELUDE.,The land slept well. The Indian from his face
721,PRELUDE.,"Washed all his war-paint off, and in the place"
722,PRELUDE.,"Of battle-marches sped the peaceful chase,"
723,PRELUDE.,
724,PRELUDE.,"Or wrought for wages at the white man's side,--"
725,PRELUDE.,Giving to kindness what his native pride
726,PRELUDE.,And lazy freedom to all else denied.
727,PRELUDE.,
728,PRELUDE.,And well the curious scholar loved the old
729,PRELUDE.,Traditions that his swarthy neighbors told
730,PRELUDE.,"By wigwam-fires when nights were growing cold,"
731,PRELUDE.,
732,PRELUDE.,Discerned the fact round which their fancy drew
733,PRELUDE.,"Its dreams, and held their childish faith more true"
734,PRELUDE.,To God and man than half the creeds he knew.
735,PRELUDE.,
736,PRELUDE.,The desert blossomed round him; wheat-fields rolled
737,PRELUDE.,Beneath the warm wind waves of green and gold;
738,PRELUDE.,The planted ear returned its hundred-fold.
739,PRELUDE.,
740,PRELUDE.,Great clusters ripened in a warmer sun
741,PRELUDE.,Than that which by the Rhine stream shines upon
742,PRELUDE.,The purpling hillsides with low vines o'errun.
743,PRELUDE.,
744,PRELUDE.,About each rustic porch the humming-bird
745,PRELUDE.,"Tried with light bill, that scarce a petal stirred,"
746,PRELUDE.,The Old World flowers to virgin soil transferred;
747,PRELUDE.,
748,PRELUDE.,"And the first-fruits of pear and apple, bending"
749,PRELUDE.,"The young boughs down, their gold and russet blending,"
750,PRELUDE.,"Made glad his heart, familiar odors lending"
751,PRELUDE.,
752,PRELUDE.,"To the fresh fragrance of the birch and pine,"
753,PRELUDE.,"Life-everlasting, bay, and eglantine,"
754,PRELUDE.,And all the subtle scents the woods combine.
755,PRELUDE.,
756,PRELUDE.,"Fair First-Day mornings, steeped in summer calm,"
757,PRELUDE.,"Warm, tender, restful, sweet with woodland balm,"
758,PRELUDE.,"Came to him, like some mother-hallowed psalm"
759,PRELUDE.,
760,PRELUDE.,To the tired grinder at the noisy wheel
761,PRELUDE.,"Of labor, winding off from memory's reel"
762,PRELUDE.,A golden thread of music. With no peal
763,PRELUDE.,
764,PRELUDE.,"Of bells to call them to the house of praise,"
765,PRELUDE.,The scattered settlers through green forest-ways
766,PRELUDE.,Walked meeting-ward. In reverent amaze
767,PRELUDE.,
768,PRELUDE.,"The Indian trapper saw them, from the dim"
769,PRELUDE.,"Shade of the alders on the rivulet's rim,"
770,PRELUDE.,Seek the Great Spirit's house to talk with Him.
771,PRELUDE.,
772,PRELUDE.,"There, through the gathered stillness multiplied"
773,PRELUDE.,"And made intense by sympathy, outside"
774,PRELUDE.,"The sparrows sang, and the gold-robin cried,"
775,PRELUDE.,
776,PRELUDE.,A-swing upon his elm. A faint perfume
777,PRELUDE.,Breathed through the open windows of the room
778,PRELUDE.,"From locust-trees, heavy with clustered bloom."
779,PRELUDE.,
780,PRELUDE.,"Thither, perchance, sore-tried confessors came,"
781,PRELUDE.,"Whose fervor jail nor pillory could tame,"
782,PRELUDE.,"Proud of the cropped ears meant to be their shame,"
783,PRELUDE.,
784,PRELUDE.,Men who had eaten slavery's bitter bread
785,PRELUDE.,In Indian isles; pale women who had bled
786,PRELUDE.,"Under the hangman's lash, and bravely said"
787,PRELUDE.,
788,PRELUDE.,God's message through their prison's iron bars;
789,PRELUDE.,"And gray old soldier-converts, seamed with scars"
790,PRELUDE.,From every stricken field of England's wars.
791,PRELUDE.,
792,PRELUDE.,Lowly before the Unseen Presence knelt
793,PRELUDE.,"Each waiting heart, till haply some one felt"
794,PRELUDE.,On his moved lips the seal of silence melt.
795,PRELUDE.,
796,PRELUDE.,"Or, without spoken words, low breathings stole"
797,PRELUDE.,"Of a diviner life from soul to soul,"
798,PRELUDE.,Baptizing in one tender thought the whole.
799,PRELUDE.,
800,PRELUDE.,"When shaken hands announced the meeting o'er,"
801,PRELUDE.,"The friendly group still lingered at the door,"
802,PRELUDE.,"Greeting, inquiring, sharing all the store"
803,PRELUDE.,
804,PRELUDE.,Of weekly tidings. Meanwhile youth and maid
805,PRELUDE.,"Down the green vistas of the woodland strayed,"
806,PRELUDE.,Whispered and smiled and oft their feet delayed.
807,PRELUDE.,
808,PRELUDE.,Did the boy's whistle answer back the thrushes?
809,PRELUDE.,"Did light girl laughter ripple through the bushes,"
810,PRELUDE.,As brooks make merry over roots and rushes?
811,PRELUDE.,
812,PRELUDE.,Unvexed the sweet air seemed. Without a wound
813,PRELUDE.,"The ear of silence heard, and every sound"
814,PRELUDE.,Its place in nature's fine accordance found.
815,PRELUDE.,
816,PRELUDE.,"And solemn meeting, summer sky and wood,"
817,PRELUDE.,"Old kindly faces, youth and maidenhood"
818,PRELUDE.,"Seemed, like God's new creation, very good!"
819,PRELUDE.,
820,PRELUDE.,"And, greeting all with quiet smile and word,"
821,PRELUDE.,Pastorius went his way. The unscared bird
822,PRELUDE.,Sang at his side; scarcely the squirrel stirred
823,PRELUDE.,
824,PRELUDE.,At his hushed footstep on the mossy sod;
825,PRELUDE.,"And, wheresoe'er the good man looked or trod,"
826,PRELUDE.,He felt the peace of nature and of God.
827,PRELUDE.,
828,PRELUDE.,"His social life wore no ascetic form,"
829,PRELUDE.,"He loved all beauty, without fear of harm,"
830,PRELUDE.,And in his veins his Teuton blood ran warm.
831,PRELUDE.,
832,PRELUDE.,"Strict to himself, of other men no spy,"
833,PRELUDE.,He made his own no circuit-judge to try
834,PRELUDE.,The freer conscience of his neighbors by.
835,PRELUDE.,
836,PRELUDE.,"With love rebuking, by his life alone,"
837,PRELUDE.,"Gracious and sweet, the better way was shown,"
838,PRELUDE.,"The joy of one, who, seeking not his own,"
839,PRELUDE.,
840,PRELUDE.,"And faithful to all scruples, finds at last"
841,PRELUDE.,"The thorns and shards of duty overpast,"
842,PRELUDE.,"And daily life, beyond his hope's forecast,"
843,PRELUDE.,
844,PRELUDE.,"Pleasant and beautiful with sight and sound,"
845,PRELUDE.,"And flowers upspringing in its narrow round,"
846,PRELUDE.,And all his days with quiet gladness crowned.
847,PRELUDE.,
848,PRELUDE.,"He sang not; but, if sometimes tempted strong,"
849,PRELUDE.,He hummed what seemed like Altorf's Burschen-song;
850,PRELUDE.,"His good wife smiled, and did not count it wrong."
851,PRELUDE.,
852,PRELUDE.,For well he loved his boyhood's brother band;
853,PRELUDE.,"His Memory, while he trod the New World's strand,"

856,PRELUDE.,"If, when on frosty Christmas eves the light"
857,PRELUDE.,"Shone on his quiet hearth, he missed the sight"
858,PRELUDE.,"Of Yule-log, Tree, and Christ-child all in white;"
859,PRELUDE.,
860,PRELUDE.,"And closed his eyes, and listened to the sweet"
861,PRELUDE.,"Old wait-songs sounding down his native street,"
862,PRELUDE.,And watched again the dancers' mingling feet;
863,PRELUDE.,
864,PRELUDE.,"Yet not the less, when once the vision passed,"
865,PRELUDE.,He held the plain and sober maxims fast
866,PRELUDE.,Of the dear Friends with whom his lot was cast.
867,PRELUDE.,
868,PRELUDE.,"Still all attuned to nature's melodies,"
869,PRELUDE.,"He loved the bird's song in his dooryard trees,"
870,PRELUDE.,And the low hum of home-returning bees;
871,PRELUDE.,
872,PRELUDE.,"The blossomed flax, the tulip-trees in bloom"
873,PRELUDE.,"Down the long street, the beauty and perfume"
874,PRELUDE.,"Of apple-boughs, the mingling light and gloom"
875,PRELUDE.,
876,PRELUDE.,"Of Sommerhausen's woodlands, woven through"
877,PRELUDE.,"With sun--threads; and the music the wind drew,"
878,PRELUDE.,"Mournful and sweet, from leaves it overblew."
879,PRELUDE.,
880,PRELUDE.,"And evermore, beneath this outward sense,"
881,PRELUDE.,"And through the common sequence of events,"
882,PRELUDE.,He felt the guiding hand of Providence
883,PRELUDE.,
884,PRELUDE.,"Reach out of space. A Voice spake in his ear,"
885,PRELUDE.,And to all other voices far and near
886,PRELUDE.,"Died at that whisper, full of meanings clear."
887,PRELUDE.,
888,PRELUDE.,The Light of Life shone round him; one by one
889,PRELUDE.,"The wandering lights, that all-misleading run,"
890,PRELUDE.,Went out like candles paling in the sun.
891,PRELUDE.,
892,PRELUDE.,"That Light he followed, step by step, where'er"
893,PRELUDE.,"It led, as in the vision of the seer"
894,PRELUDE.,The wheels moved as the spirit in the clear
895,PRELUDE.,
896,PRELUDE.,"And terrible crystal moved, with all their eyes"
897,PRELUDE.,"Watching the living splendor sink or rise,"
898,PRELUDE.,"Its will their will, knowing no otherwise."
899,PRELUDE.,
900,PRELUDE.,"Within himself he found the law of right,"
901,PRELUDE.,"He walked by faith and not the letter's sight,"
902,PRELUDE.,And read his Bible by the Inward Light.
903,PRELUDE.,
904,PRELUDE.,"And if sometimes the slaves of form and rule,"
905,PRELUDE.,"Frozen in their creeds like fish in winter's pool,"
906,PRELUDE.,"Tried the large tolerance of his liberal school,"
907,PRELUDE.,
908,PRELUDE.,"His door was free to men of every name,"
909,PRELUDE.,"He welcomed all the seeking souls who came,"
910,PRELUDE.,And no man's faith he made a cause of blame.
911,PRELUDE.,
912,PRELUDE.,But best he loved in leisure hours to see
913,PRELUDE.,"His own dear Friends sit by him knee to knee,"
914,PRELUDE.,"In social converse, genial, frank, and free."
915,PRELUDE.,
916,PRELUDE.,There sometimes silence (it were hard to tell
917,PRELUDE.,"Who owned it first) upon the circle fell,"
918,PRELUDE.,"Hushed Anna's busy wheel, and laid its spell"
919,PRELUDE.,
920,PRELUDE.,"On the black boy who grimaced by the hearth,"
921,PRELUDE.,To solemnize his shining face of mirth;
922,PRELUDE.,Only the old clock ticked amidst the dearth
923,PRELUDE.,
924,PRELUDE.,Of sound; nor eye was raised nor hand was stirred
925,PRELUDE.,"In that soul-sabbath, till at last some word"
926,PRELUDE.,Of tender counsel or low prayer was heard.
927,PRELUDE.,
928,PRELUDE.,"Then guests, who lingered but farewell to say"
929,PRELUDE.,"And take love's message, went their homeward way;"
930,PRELUDE.,So passed in peace the guileless Quaker's day.
931,PRELUDE.,
932,PRELUDE.,"His was the Christian's unsung Age of Gold,"
933,PRELUDE.,A truer idyl than the bards have told
934,PRELUDE.,Of Arno's banks or Arcady of old.
935,PRELUDE.,
936,PRELUDE.,"Where still the Friends their place of burial keep,"
937,PRELUDE.,"And century-rooted mosses o'er it creep,"
938,PRELUDE.,The Nurnberg scholar and his helpmeet sleep.
939,PRELUDE.,
940,PRELUDE.,And Anna's aloe? If it flowered at last

942,PRELUDE.,A glance upon it as he meekly passed?
943,PRELUDE.,
944,PRELUDE.,And did a secret sympathy possess

956,PRELUDE.,
957,PRELUDE.,"For, ere Pastorius left the sun and air,"
958,PRELUDE.,God sent the answer to his life-long prayer;

960,PRELUDE.,
961,PRELUDE.,"Who, in the power a holy purpose lends,"
962,PRELUDE.,"Guided his people unto nobler ends,"

1269,JOHN UNDERHILL.,A SCORE of years had come and gone
1270,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Since the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth stone,"
1271,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"When Captain Underhill, bearing scars"
1272,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"From Indian ambush and Flemish wars,"
1273,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Left three-hilled Boston and wandered down,"
1274,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"East by north, to Cocheco town."
1275,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1276,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"With Vane the younger, in counsel sweet,"
1277,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"He had sat at Anna Hutchinson's feet,"
1278,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"And, when the bolt of banishment fell"
1279,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"On the head of his saintly oracle,"
1280,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"He had shared her ill as her good report,"
1281,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And braved the wrath of the General Court.
1282,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1283,JOHN UNDERHILL.,He shook from his feet as he rode away
1284,JOHN UNDERHILL.,The dust of the Massachusetts Bay.
1285,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"The world might bless and the world might ban,"

1288,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Proof against sin, and sure of heaven?"
1289,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1290,JOHN UNDERHILL.,He cheered his heart as he rode along
1291,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"With screed of Scripture and holy song,"
1292,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Or thought how he rode with his lances free
1293,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"By the Lower Rhine and the Zuyder-Zee,"
1294,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Till his wood-path grew to a trodden road,"
1295,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And Hilton Point in the distance showed.

1297,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"He saw the church with the block-house nigh,"
1298,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"The two fair rivers, the flakes thereby,"
1299,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"And, tacking to windward, low and crank,"
1300,JOHN UNDERHILL.,The little shallop from Strawberry Bank;
1301,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And he rose in his stirrups and looked abroad
1302,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Over land and water, and praised the Lord."
1303,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1304,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Goodly and stately and grave to see,"
1305,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Into the clearing's space rode he,"
1306,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"With the sun on the hilt of his sword in sheath,"
1307,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"And his silver buckles and spurs beneath,"
1308,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"And the settlers welcomed him, one and all,"
1309,JOHN UNDERHILL.,From swift Quampeagan to Gonic Fall.
1310,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1311,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"And he said to the elders: ""Lo, I come"
1312,JOHN UNDERHILL.,As the way seemed open to seek a home.
1313,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Somewhat the Lord hath wrought by my hands
1314,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"In the Narragansett and Netherlands,"

1318,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"""I boast not of gifts, but fain would own"
1319,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"The wonderful favor God hath shown,"
1320,JOHN UNDERHILL.,The special mercy vouchsafed one day
1321,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"On the shore of Narragansett Bay,"
1322,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"As I sat, with my pipe, from the camp aside,"
1323,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And mused like Isaac at eventide.
1324,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1325,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"""A sudden sweetness of peace I found,"
1326,JOHN UNDERHILL.,A garment of gladness wrapped me round;
1327,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"I felt from the law of works released,"
1328,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"The strife of the flesh and spirit ceased,"
1329,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"My faith to a full assurance grew,"
1330,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And all I had hoped for myself I knew.

1332,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"""Now, as God appointeth, I keep my way,"

1339,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"""Tarry with us,"" the settlers cried,"
1340,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"""Thou man of God, as our ruler and guide."""
1341,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And Captain Underhill bowed his head.
1342,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"""The will of the Lord be done!"" he said."
1343,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And the morrow beheld him sitting down
1344,JOHN UNDERHILL.,In the ruler's seat in Cocheco town.
1345,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1346,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And he judged therein as a just man should;
1347,JOHN UNDERHILL.,His words were wise and his rule was good;
1348,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"He coveted not his neighbor's land,"
1349,JOHN UNDERHILL.,From the holding of bribes he shook his hand;
1350,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And through the camps of the heathen ran
1351,JOHN UNDERHILL.,A wholesome fear of the valiant man.
1352,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1353,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"But the heart is deceitful, the good Book saith,"
1354,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And life hath ever a savor of death.
1355,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Through hymns of triumph the tempter calls,"
1356,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And whoso thinketh he standeth falls.
1357,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Alas! ere their round the seasons ran,"
1358,JOHN UNDERHILL.,There was grief in the soul of the saintly man.
1359,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1360,JOHN UNDERHILL.,The tempter's arrows that rarely fail
1361,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Had found the joints of his spiritual mail;
1362,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"And men took note of his gloomy air,"
1363,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"The shame in his eye, the halt in his prayer,"
1364,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"The signs of a battle lost within,"
1365,JOHN UNDERHILL.,The pain of a soul in the coils of sin.
1366,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1367,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Then a whisper of scandal linked his name
1368,JOHN UNDERHILL.,With broken vows and a life of blame;
1369,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And the people looked askance on him
1370,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"As he walked among them sullen and grim,"
1371,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Ill at ease, and bitter of word,"
1372,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And prompt of quarrel with hand or sword.
1373,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1374,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"None knew how, with prayer and fasting still,"
1375,JOHN UNDERHILL.,He strove in the bonds of his evil will;
1376,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"But he shook himself like Samson at length,"
1377,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"And girded anew his loins of strength,"
1378,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And bade the crier go up and down
1379,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And call together the wondering town.
1380,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1381,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Jeer and murmur and shaking of head
1382,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Ceased as he rose in his place and said
1383,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"""Men, brethren, and fathers, well ye know"
1384,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"How I came among you a year ago,"
1385,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Strong in the faith that my soul was freed
1386,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"From sin of feeling, or thought, or deed."
1387,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1388,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"""I have sinned, I own it with grief and shame,"
1389,JOHN UNDERHILL.,But not with a lie on my lips I came.
1390,JOHN UNDERHILL.,In my blindness I verily thought my heart
1391,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Swept and garnished in every part.
1392,JOHN UNDERHILL.,He chargeth His angels with folly; He sees
1393,JOHN UNDERHILL.,The heavens unclean. Was I more than these?
1394,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1395,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"""I urge no plea. At your feet I lay"
1396,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"The trust you gave me, and go my way."
1397,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Hate me or pity me, as you will,"
1398,JOHN UNDERHILL.,The Lord will have mercy on sinners still;
1399,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"And I, who am chiefest, say to all,"
1400,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Watch and pray, lest ye also fall."""
1401,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1402,JOHN UNDERHILL.,No voice made answer: a sob so low
1403,JOHN UNDERHILL.,That only his quickened ear could know
1404,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Smote his heart with a bitter pain,"
1405,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"As into the forest he rode again,"
1406,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And the veil of its oaken leaves shut down
1407,JOHN UNDERHILL.,On his latest glimpse of Cocheco town.
1408,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1409,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Crystal-clear on the man of sin
1410,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"The streams flashed up, and the sky shone in;"
1411,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"On his cheek of fever the cool wind blew,"
1412,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"The leaves dropped on him their tears of dew,"
1413,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"And angels of God, in the pure, sweet guise"
1414,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Of flowers, looked on him with sad surprise."
1415,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1416,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Was his ear at fault that brook and breeze
1417,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Sang in their saddest of minor keys?
1418,JOHN UNDERHILL.,What was it the mournful wood-thrush said?
1419,JOHN UNDERHILL.,What whispered the pine-trees overhead?
1420,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Did he hear the Voice on his lonely way
1421,JOHN UNDERHILL.,That Adam heard in the cool of day?
1422,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1423,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"Into the desert alone rode he,"
1424,JOHN UNDERHILL.,Alone with the Infinite Purity;
1425,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"And, bowing his soul to its tender rebuke,"
1426,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"As Peter did to the Master's look,"
1427,JOHN UNDERHILL.,He measured his path with prayers of pain
1428,JOHN UNDERHILL.,For peace with God and nature again.
1429,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1430,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And in after years to Cocheco came
1431,JOHN UNDERHILL.,The bruit of a once familiar name;
1432,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"How among the Dutch of New Netherlands,"
1433,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"From wild Danskamer to Haarlem sands,"
1434,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"A penitent soldier preached the Word,"
1435,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And smote the heathen with Gideon's sword!
1436,JOHN UNDERHILL.,
1437,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And the heart of Boston was glad to hear
1438,JOHN UNDERHILL.,"How he harried the foe on the long frontier,"
1439,JOHN UNDERHILL.,And heaped on the land against him barred
1440,JOHN UNDERHILL.,The coals of his generous watch and ward.

2231,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"This ballad, originally written for The Memorial History of Boston,"
2232,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"describes, with pardonable poetic license, a memorable incident in the"
2233,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,annals of the city. The interview between Shattuck and the Governor took
2234,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"place, I have since learned, in the residence of the latter, and not"
2235,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,in the Council Chamber. The publication of the ballad led to some
2236,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"discussion as to the historical truthfulness of the picture, but I have"
2237,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,seen no reason to rub out any of the figures or alter the lines and
2238,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,colors.
2239,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,
2240,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,
2241,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,UNDER the great hill sloping bare

2243,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"In his council chamber and oaken chair,"
2244,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,Sat the worshipful Governor Endicott.

2247,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"Of God, not man, and for good or ill"
2248,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,Held his trust with an iron will.
2249,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,
2250,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,He had shorn with his sword the cross from out
2251,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"The flag, and cloven the May-pole down,"
2252,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"Harried the heathen round about,"
2253,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,And whipped the Quakers from town to town.
2254,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"Earnest and honest, a man at need"
2255,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"To burn like a torch for his own harsh creed,"
2256,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,He kept with the flaming brand of his zeal

2258,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,
2259,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"His brow was clouded, his eye was stern,"

2294,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,
2295,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"""Off with the knave's hat!"" An angry hand"

2299,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,In the Governor's hand a missive he laid

2317,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,And the voice of one appointed to die
2318,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"Was lifted in praise and thanks on high,"
2319,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,And the little maid from New Netherlands
2320,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"Kissed, in her joy, the doomed man's hands."

2322,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"And one, whose call was to minister"

2331,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,One moment they paused on their way to look

2334,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,His burden of prophecy up and cried
2335,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"""Rest, souls of the valiant! Not in vain"

2349,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"The topaz leaves of the walnut glowed,"

2352,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,The tinted maples along the Neck;
2353,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"Through frost flower clusters of pale star-mist,"
2354,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"And gentian fringes of amethyst,"
2355,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"And royal plumes of golden-rod,"
2356,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,The grazing cattle on Centry trod.
2357,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,
2358,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"But as they who see not, the Quakers saw"

2362,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,Through lane and alley the gazing town
2363,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,Noisily followed them up and down;

2367,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,One brave voice rose above the din.
2368,THE KING'S MISSIVE.,"Upsall, gray with his length of days,"
