50,MY WIFE.,This simple story will be recognized by many throughout New England to
51,MY WIFE.,whom the author has had the pleasure of reciting it. Frequent requests
52,MY WIFE.,that he would place it in shape for preservation have emboldened him
53,MY WIFE.,to issue it in its present dress. Painfully conscious of its defects
54,MY WIFE.,"as a literary work, he sends it forth in search of old acquaintances,"
55,MY WIFE.,trusting it may receive a share of that kindly favor bestowed upon it
56,MY WIFE.,as it fell from his lips.

88,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.
89,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
90,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
91,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"In the loftiest room, of princely state,"
92,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Of a modern palace grand and great,--"
93,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Whose marble front is a symbol true
94,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Of the inner splendors hid from view,--"
95,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"On an autumn night, when wild without"
96,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"The bold winds held their revel rout,"
97,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Rudely assailing the passing throng,"
98,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Through churchyards creeping with mournful song,"
99,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,A group was gathered around a board
100,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Heaped with all that wealth could afford,"
101,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Or taste could suggest: dishes costly and rare,"
102,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Fruits of all climes and all seasons, were there."
103,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,The pendent lights in brilliance danced
104,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,On the gleaming plate their rays enhanced;
105,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,The massive mirrors thrice displayed
106,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,The stately banquet there arrayed.
107,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Furniture carved by an artist hand,"
108,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Carpets which only great wealth could command,"
109,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Curtains of damask, of lace, and of gold,"
110,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Spoke of the splendors wealth could unfold,"
111,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,And filled with a joy and a pleasure rare
112,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,The youthful hearts that were gathered there.
113,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Slender each form, and fair each face,"
114,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Of the twelve gay lads which that table grace,"
115,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,As with genial talk and pleasant jest
116,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"They banter each other, and cheer their guest."
117,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"For one guest is there, as youthful as they,"
118,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"With a heart as light, and a voice as gay,"
119,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Who laughs at their jests with ready glee,"
120,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And whose quick returns speak a spirit free,"
121,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"An honored guest; for, on the morrow,"
122,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,They must part with him in pain and sorrow.
123,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,The glittering emblems his shoulders bear
124,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Bid him for strife and for peril prepare;
125,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Bid him go forth at his Country's call,"
126,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"With her banner to triumph, or on it to fall."
127,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"A moment's pause, as with ready hand"
128,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"The waiter hurries, at command,"
129,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"To clear the table, and, instead"
130,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Of the rich, choice viands thickly spread,"
131,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Ranges dark bottles and cruses, which show"
132,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Marks of long years in damp vaults below.
133,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,The richest juices age can display
134,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Are quickly spread in tempting array.
135,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Wines of Bordeaux and Seville are there,"
136,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,With liquors and cordials sparkling and rare;
137,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And bottles are opened, and glasses are filled."
138,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"When all in a moment the tumult is stilled,"
139,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,As he who presides with dignified grace
140,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"High raises his goblet, and stands in his place:--"
141,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"""I give you, friends, no warrior's name"
142,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Your hearts to thrill, your blood to flame;"
143,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"No toast to beauty shall my lips repeat,"
144,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Where we to-night in sacred friendship meet
145,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"To part with one, who, in our boyhood's days,"
146,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Earnest and true, won all our love and praise;"
147,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Who, on the morrow, plays the hero's part,"
148,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,And seeks the battle with a loyal heart.
149,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"His health I give with an earnest prayer,"
150,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"That, while on his mission of peril and care,"
151,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Success may be his, and, by deeds renowned,"
152,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"He may meet us again with laurels crowned."""
153,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"All glasses are raised, when a gentle hand"
154,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Is heard at the door--all silent stand
155,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"As it slowly opens, and into the light"
156,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"An old man steps, his features bright:"
157,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,The long white hairs o'er his shoulders stream;
158,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Like silver threads in the warm rays beam.
159,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Wrinkled his brow, and pale his face,"
160,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Wasted his form, and tottering his pace,"
161,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Shrunken his cheek; but the eye above
162,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Tells of gentleness, kindliness, love."
163,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,And silent stand all as he slowly seeks
164,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"A place near the table, and gently speaks:--"
165,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
166,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,[Illustration]
167,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
168,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"""Young men, but a moment I check your mirth,"
169,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,And bring you back to the common earth.
170,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Unbidden I come with an old man's prayer:
171,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"May it seek your hearts, and gain entrance there!"
172,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Look on my face, seamed, not with crime,"
173,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,But with marks of age before their time:
174,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,These long white hairs should not have shown
175,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Till ten more years had by me flown.
176,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Age is upon me; not age by years,"
177,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,But age by sorrow and care and tears;
178,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Not age that cheers as it draweth near
179,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Yon heaven which seemeth more bright and clear,"
180,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,But age which causes the heart to lag
181,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"In its onward course, and the spirit to flag;"
182,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,That prays for death as but a release
183,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"From earthly care, and finds no peace"
184,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"In that sweet belief that at last I hail,--"
185,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,'There is rest for the weary beyond the vale.'
186,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"For to me has come a spirit of light,"
187,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Bringing the morning, and chasing the night;"
188,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Causing my heart with joy to swell
189,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"To my Maker, 'who doeth all things well.'"
190,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"You shall hear my story: 'twill not be long,"
191,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,And may guard you all from sin and from wrong.
192,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"I had wealth and plenty in goodly lands,"
193,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,In houses and cattle; and from my hands
194,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Many were fed; and many were they
195,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Who partook of my charity day by day.
196,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,My house was open to stranger and friend;
197,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And my gold did I lavishly, freely spend."
198,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,But one bitter curse did my wealth uprear
199,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"To poison my life,--the tempter here,"
200,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"The sparkling demon, which now I see"
201,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"From all your glasses glaring on me,--"
202,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"A monster who steals on its prey so slow,"
203,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,That it has your life before you know
204,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Or dream of its power: this was the curse
205,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"That sat at my fire-side, robbed my purse,"
206,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Poisoned my life, and left me to be"
207,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"A drifting log on the world's wide sea,"
208,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Ruined and bankrupt, lost and bereft;"
209,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"No kindred, no fortune, no treasure, left."
210,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Treasure!--yes; for I had three sons,"
211,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"The hope of my life,--three noble ones."
212,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"You shall hear their fate, and then I'll away,"
213,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Nor longer your hour of pleasure delay.
214,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
215,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,[Illustration]
216,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
217,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,One sought as a merchant hopeful to clear
218,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Our tarnished name, to again uprear"
219,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Our shattered house; but, sad to say,"
220,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,The curse of the wine-cup was in his way.
221,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"He seized on it madly, drank deep and fast,"
222,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,And sank to the drunkard's grave at last.
223,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,I stood by his side as with frenzy wild
224,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,He cursed himself and his wife and child;
225,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"He cursed me too, as the one who had led"
226,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,His feet in the path that drunkards tread;
227,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,And then--it was worse than all beside--
228,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,He cursed his Maker; and then--he died!
229,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
230,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,[Illustration]
231,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
232,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Another, with spirit that loved to brave,"
233,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Sought a bold, free life on the ocean-wave."
234,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"He left my side full of life and health,"
235,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"In a good stanch ship, in search of wealth."
236,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"A twelvemonth passed, and day by day"
237,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,I scanned for his sail the distant bay.
238,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"At last I saw it, and eagerly flew"
239,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,To welcome my boy so manly and true.
240,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"But, alas! he was gone: no son to greet"
241,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,My waiting heart came with eager feet.
242,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"But they told me there,--one stormy night,"
243,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"When the heavens were filled with angry light,"
244,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"The waves rolled high, and the winds beat wild,"
245,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,That out on a frail yard went my child;
246,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"He had drunk deep, and 'twas fearful to sweep"
247,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,On that slender spar o'er the seething deep;
248,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"That one heavy sea tossed the ship like a toy,"
249,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,And hurled from his hold my darling boy.
250,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Then I sank me down in agony wild,"
251,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,And glared on the waves that rolled over my child:
252,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,I gazed until in the waters blue
253,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,I saw reflected the brilliant hue
254,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Of one lone star, which, high above,"
255,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Seemed to speak to my heart of faith and love;
256,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And I thought, as I turned my eyes to its light."
257,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"It beckoned me on to the heavens so bright,"
258,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Where I know, whenever this life shall cease,"
259,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,I shall meet my boy in eternal peace.
260,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
261,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,[Illustration]
262,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
263,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,I had but one left; and him I taught
264,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,To shun each sinful word and thought;
265,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"To beware of the wine-cup's demon lure,"
266,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"That would steel his heart, and his soul obscure."
267,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,He took the way of life that leads
268,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"To the sacred desk where the preacher pleads,"
269,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And placed his foot on the pulpit stair,"
270,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,The gospel--banner of life--to bear.
271,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"When the cannon's boom o'er Sumter broke,"
272,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,And the air was filled with traitorous smoke;
273,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,When brave men sprang with willing hearts
274,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,To their Country's flag to repel the darts
275,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Which treason had hurled with malice wild
276,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"At the life of the mother, so good and mild,--"
277,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"My boy stepped down from the preacher's stand,"
278,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And started forth, with life in hand,"
279,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"To sell it dear, but to battle strong"
280,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,With the loyal North against fearful wrong.
281,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,I know that he carries a magic spell
282,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,'Gainst the curse of our race to guard him well;
283,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And I know, should he fall, his death will be"
284,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,In the foremost ranks of loyalty.
285,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And now, young men, an old man's prayer:--"
286,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Leave the bright wine in your glasses there;
287,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Shun its allurements; for in its deep red
288,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Is the blood of its victims dying and dead.
289,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Fill up your glasses, and pledge your friend"
290,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"In the crystal stream that Heaven doth send."""
291,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
292,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,[Illustration]
293,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
294,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"With a lowly bow, and the same meek air,"
295,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"He has passed the door, and adown the stair;"
296,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,While those he has left to their leader turn
297,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"With downcast eyes, and cheeks that burn."
298,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Silent he stands as his glass he takes,"
299,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,When the guest of the evening the silence breaks.
300,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"""Friends of my boyhood, the old man's prayer"
301,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Shall meet a response in the heart I wear.
302,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,I come to-night from a mother's side:
303,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,She watches my life with a parent's pride;
304,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And I know 'tis the dearest wish of her heart,"
305,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,In camp and in battle to keep me apart
306,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,From sin and temptation; unceasing will pray
307,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Heaven's blessing to guard on my perilous way.
308,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And this pledge will I leave her,--never again"
309,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,My lips with the wine-cup's poison to stain.
310,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"So, friends, let's drink to our meeting again:"
311,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"My drink is the water, free from all stain."""
312,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
313,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,[Illustration]
314,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
315,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"He stood with his upraised glass, and the light"
316,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Full on his fair young brow beamed bright,--"
317,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,That brow which an anxious mother would kiss
318,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"With a pure, deep feeling of heartfelt bliss;"
319,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And along the line of his comrades young,"
320,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"To honor his toast, each hand upsprung:"
321,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,In not one glass did the red wine gleam;
322,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,But all were filled from the crystal stream.
323,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
324,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,[Illustration]
325,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,
326,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"On the morrow, adown the street,"
327,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"With trumpet's blast and war-drum's beat,"
328,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"Firm and erect, with martial tread,"
329,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"The flag of their Country overhead,"
330,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"With brave, stout hearts, and patriot-song,"
331,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,The Nation's heroes go marching along.
332,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"And our soldier is there, marching forth"
333,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,To join the bands of the loyal North;
334,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,"To strike a blow for his Country dear,"
335,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,And her trailing flag to again uprear.
336,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Light is his heart; his faith is strong;
337,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Bright gleams his sword as he moves along:
338,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,But the armor he wears shall serve him best
339,AN OLD MAN'S PRAYER.,Is the shield of Temperance guarding his breast.
