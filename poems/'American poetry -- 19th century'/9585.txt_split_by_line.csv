57,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,
58,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"Low in the east, against a white, cold dawn,"
59,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"The black-lined silhouette of the woods was drawn,"
60,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,And on a wintry waste
61,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"Of frosted streams and hillsides bare and brown,"
62,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"Through thin cloud-films, a pallid ghost looked down,"
63,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,The waning moon half-faced!
64,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,
65,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"In that pale sky and sere, snow-waiting earth,"
66,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,What sign was there of the immortal birth?
67,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,What herald of the One?
68,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"Lo! swift as thought the heavenly radiance came,"
69,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"A rose-red splendor swept the sky like flame,"
70,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"Up rolled the round, bright sun!"
71,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,
72,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,And all was changed. From a transfigured world
73,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"The moon's ghost fled, the smoke of home-hearths curled"
74,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,Up the still air unblown.
75,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"In Orient warmth and brightness, did that morn"
76,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"O'er Nain and Nazareth, when the Christ was born,"
77,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,Break fairer than our own?
78,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,
79,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,The morning's promise noon and eve fulfilled
80,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"In warm, soft sky and landscape hazy-hilled"
81,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,And sunset fair as they;
82,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"A sweet reminder of His holiest time,"
83,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"A summer-miracle in our winter clime,"
84,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,God gave a perfect day.
85,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,
86,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"The near was blended with the old and far,"
87,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,And Bethlehem's hillside and the Magi's star
88,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"Seemed here, as there and then,--"
89,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"Our homestead pine-tree was the Syrian palm,"
90,THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888.,"Our heart's desire the angels' midnight psalm,"

101,THE VOW OF WASHINGTON.,The sword was sheathed: in April's sun

198,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.
199,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
200,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"The story of the shipwreck of Captain Valentine Bagley, on the"
201,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"coast of Arabia, and his sufferings in the desert, has been"
202,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,familiar from my childhood. It has been partially told in the
203,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"singularly beautiful lines of my friend, Harriet Prescott Spofford,"
204,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,an the occasion of a public celebration at the Newburyport Library.
205,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"To the charm and felicity of her verse, as far as it goes, nothing"
206,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,can be added; but in the following ballad I have endeavored to give
207,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,a fuller detail of the touching incident upon which it is founded.
208,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
209,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"From pain and peril, by land and main,"
210,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,The shipwrecked sailor came back again;
211,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
212,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"And like one from the dead, the threshold cross'd"
213,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Of his wondering home, that had mourned him lost."
214,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
215,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Where he sat once more with his kith and kin,"
216,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,And welcomed his neighbors thronging in.
217,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
218,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,But when morning came he called for his spade.
219,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""I must pay my debt to the Lord,"" he said."
220,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
221,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Why dig you here?"" asked the passer-by;"
222,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Is there gold or silver the road so nigh?"""
223,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
224,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""No, friend,"" he answered: ""but under this sod"
225,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Is the blessed water, the wine of God."""
226,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
227,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Water! the Powow is at your back,"
228,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"And right before you the Merrimac,"
229,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
230,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""And look you up, or look you down,"
231,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"There 's a well-sweep at every door in town."""
232,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
233,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""True,"" he said, ""we have wells of our own;"
234,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"But this I dig for the Lord alone."""
235,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
236,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Said the other: ""This soil is dry, you know."
237,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,I doubt if a spring can be found below;
238,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
239,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""You had better consult, before you dig,"
240,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Some water-witch, with a hazel twig."""
241,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
242,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""No, wet or dry, I will dig it here,"
243,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Shallow or deep, if it takes a year."
244,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
245,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""In the Arab desert, where shade is none,"
246,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"The waterless land of sand and sun,"
247,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
248,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Under the pitiless, brazen sky"
249,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,My burning throat as the sand was dry;
250,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
251,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""My crazed brain listened in fever dreams"
252,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,For plash of buckets and ripple of streams;
253,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
254,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""And opening my eyes to the blinding glare,"
255,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"And my lips to the breath of the blistering air,"
256,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
257,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Tortured alike by the heavens and earth,"
258,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"I cursed, like Job, the day of my birth."
259,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
260,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Then something tender, and sad, and mild"
261,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"As a mother's voice to her wandering child,"
262,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
263,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Rebuked my frenzy; and bowing my head,"
264,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,I prayed as I never before had prayed:
265,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
266,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Pity me, God! for I die of thirst;"
267,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,Take me out of this land accurst;
268,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
269,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""And if ever I reach my home again,"
270,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Where earth has springs, and the sky has rain,"
271,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
272,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""I will dig a well for the passers-by,"
273,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,And none shall suffer from thirst as I.
274,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
275,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""I saw, as I prayed, my home once more,"
276,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"The house, the barn, the elms by the door,"
277,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
278,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""The grass-lined road, that riverward wound,"
279,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"The tall slate stones of the burying-ground,"
280,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
281,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""The belfry and steeple on meeting-house hill,"
282,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"The brook with its dam, and gray grist mill,"
283,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
284,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""And I knew in that vision beyond the sea,"
285,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,The very place where my well must be.
286,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
287,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""God heard my prayer in that evil day;"
288,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"He led my feet in their homeward way,"
289,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
290,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""From false mirage and dried-up well,"
291,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"And the hot sand storms of a land of hell,"
292,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
293,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Till I saw at last through the coast-hill's gap,"
294,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"A city held in its stony lap,"
295,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
296,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""The mosques and the domes of scorched Muscat,"
297,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,And my heart leaped up with joy thereat;
298,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
299,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""For there was a ship at anchor lying,"
300,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"A Christian flag at its mast-head flying,"
301,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
302,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""And sweetest of sounds to my homesick ear"
303,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,Was my native tongue in the sailor's cheer.
304,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
305,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Now the Lord be thanked, I am back again,"
306,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Where earth has springs, and the skies have rain,"
307,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
308,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""And the well I promised by Oman's Sea,"
309,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"I am digging for him in Amesbury."""
310,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
311,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"His kindred wept, and his neighbors said"
312,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""The poor old captain is out of his head."""
313,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
314,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"But from morn to noon, and from noon to night,"
315,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,He toiled at his task with main and might;
316,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
317,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"And when at last, from the loosened earth,"
318,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Under his spade the stream gushed forth,"
319,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
320,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"And fast as he climbed to his deep well's brim,"
321,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"The water he dug for followed him,"
322,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
323,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"He shouted for joy: ""I have kept my word,"
324,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"And here is the well I promised the Lord!"""
325,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
326,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"The long years came and the long years went,"
327,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,And he sat by his roadside well content;
328,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
329,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"He watched the travellers, heat-oppressed,"
330,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Pause by the way to drink and rest,"
331,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
332,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"And the sweltering horses dip, as they drank,"
333,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Their nostrils deep in the cool, sweet tank,"
334,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
335,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"And grateful at heart, his memory went"
336,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Back to that waterless Orient,"
337,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
338,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"And the blessed answer of prayer, which came"
339,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,To the earth of iron and sky of flame.
340,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
341,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"And when a wayfarer weary and hot,"
342,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"Kept to the mid road, pausing not"
343,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
344,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"For the well's refreshing, he shook his head;"
345,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""He don't know the value of water,"" he said;"
346,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
347,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Had he prayed for a drop, as I have done,"
348,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"In the desert circle of sand and sun,"
349,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
350,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""He would drink and rest, and go home to tell"
351,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"That God's best gift is the wayside well!"""
