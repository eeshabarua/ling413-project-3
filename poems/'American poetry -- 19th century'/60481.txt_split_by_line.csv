828,HEROISM.,To lift the weight of the unnumbered years
829,HEROISM.,"Of dead men’s habits, methods, and ideas;"
830,HEROISM.,"To hold that back with one hand, and support"
831,HEROISM.,With the other the weak steps of a new thought.
832,HEROISM.,
833,HEROISM.,It takes great strength to bring your life up square

836,HEROISM.,From new attempts to the old habit’s track.
837,HEROISM.,"It is so easy to drift back, to sink;"
838,HEROISM.,So hard to live abreast of what you think!
839,HEROISM.,

849,HEROISM.,Courage to undertake this lifelong strain
850,HEROISM.,Of setting yours against your grandsire’s brain;
851,HEROISM.,Dangerous risk of walking lone and free
852,HEROISM.,"Out of the easy paths that used to be,"
853,HEROISM.,And the fierce pain of hurting those we love
854,HEROISM.,"When love meets truth, and truth must ride above?"
855,HEROISM.,
856,HEROISM.,But the best courage man has ever shown
857,HEROISM.,Is daring to cut loose and think alone.
858,HEROISM.,Dark as the unlit chambers of clear space
859,HEROISM.,Where light shines back from no reflecting face.
860,HEROISM.,"Our sun’s wide glare, our heaven’s shining blue,"
861,HEROISM.,We owe to fog and dust they fumble through;
862,HEROISM.,And our rich wisdom that we treasure so
863,HEROISM.,Shines from the thousand things that we don’t know.
864,HEROISM.,But to think new—it takes a courage grim
865,HEROISM.,As led Columbus over the world’s rim.
866,HEROISM.,To think it cost some courage. And to go—
867,HEROISM.,Try it. It taxes every power you know.
868,HEROISM.,
869,HEROISM.,It takes great love to stir a human heart
870,HEROISM.,To live beyond the others and apart.
871,HEROISM.,"A love that is not shallow, is not small,"
872,HEROISM.,"Is not for one, or two, but for them all."
873,HEROISM.,"Love that can wound love, for its higher need;"
874,HEROISM.,Love that can leave love though the heart may bleed;
875,HEROISM.,"Love that can lose love; family, and friend;"
876,HEROISM.,"Yet steadfastly live, loving, to the end."
877,HEROISM.,"A love that asks no answer, that can live"
