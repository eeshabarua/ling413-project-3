39,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
40,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The volume in which ""The Bay of Seven Islands"" was published was"
41,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"dedicated to the late Edwin Percy Whipple, to whom more than to any"
42,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,other person I was indebted for public recognition as one worthy of a
43,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"place in American literature, at a time when it required a great degree"
44,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,of courage to urge such a claim for a pro-scribed abolitionist. Although
45,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"younger than I, he had gained the reputation of a brilliant essayist,"
46,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,and was regarded as the highest American authority in criticism. His wit
47,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,and wisdom enlivened a small literary circle of young men including
48,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Thomas Starr King, the eloquent preacher, and Daniel N. Haskell of the"
49,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Daily Transcript, who gathered about our common friend dames T. Fields"
50,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,at the Old Corner Bookstore. The poem which gave title to the volume I
51,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"inscribed to my friend and neighbor Harriet Prescott Spofford, whose"
52,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,poems have lent a new interest to our beautiful river-valley.
53,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
54,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,FROM the green Amesbury hill which bears the name
55,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Of that half mythic ancestor of mine
56,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Who trod its slopes two hundred years ago,"
57,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Down the long valley of the Merrimac,"
58,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Midway between me and the river's mouth,"
59,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"I see thy home, set like an eagle's nest"
60,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Among Deer Island's immemorial pines,"
61,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Crowning the crag on which the sunset breaks
62,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Its last red arrow. Many a tale and song,"
63,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Which thou bast told or sung, I call to mind,"
64,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Softening with silvery mist the woods and hills,"
65,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,The out-thrust headlands and inreaching bays
66,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Of our northeastern coast-line, trending where"
67,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The Gulf, midsummer, feels the chill blockade"
68,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Of icebergs stranded at its northern gate.
69,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
70,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,To thee the echoes of the Island Sound
71,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Answer not vainly, nor in vain the moan"
72,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Of the South Breaker prophesying storm.
73,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"And thou hast listened, like myself, to men"
74,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Sea-periled oft where Anticosti lies
75,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Like a fell spider in its web of fog,"
76,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Or where the Grand Bank shallows with the wrecks
77,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Of sunken fishers, and to whom strange isles"
78,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And frost-rimmed bays and trading stations seem
79,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Familiar as Great Neck and Kettle Cove,"
80,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Nubble and Boon, the common names of home."
81,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"So let me offer thee this lay of mine,"
82,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Simple and homely, lacking much thy play"
83,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Of color and of fancy. If its theme
84,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And treatment seem to thee befitting youth
85,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Rather than age, let this be my excuse"
86,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,It has beguiled some heavy hours and called
87,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Some pleasant memories up; and, better still,"
88,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Occasion lent me for a kindly word
89,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,To one who is my neighbor and my friend.
90,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,1883.
91,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
92,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,. . . . . . . . . .
93,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
94,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The skipper sailed out of the harbor mouth,"
95,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Leaving the apple-bloom of the South
96,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"For the ice of the Eastern seas,"
97,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,In his fishing schooner Breeze.
98,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
99,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Handsome and brave and young was he,"
100,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And the maids of Newbury sighed to see
101,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,His lessening white sail fall
102,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Under the sea's blue wall.
103,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
104,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Through the Northern Gulf and the misty screen
105,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Of the isles of Mingan and Madeleine,"
106,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"St. Paul's and Blanc Sablon,"
107,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The little Breeze sailed on,"
108,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
109,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Backward and forward, along the shore"
110,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Of lorn and desolate Labrador,"
111,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And found at last her way
112,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,To the Seven Islands Bay.
113,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
114,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The little hamlet, nestling below"
115,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Great hills white with lingering snow,"
116,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,With its tin-roofed chapel stood
117,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Half hid in the dwarf spruce wood;
118,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
119,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Green-turfed, flower-sown, the last outpost"
120,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Of summer upon the dreary coast,"
121,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"With its gardens small and spare,"
122,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Sad in the frosty air.
123,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
124,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Hard by where the skipper's schooner lay,"
125,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,A fisherman's cottage looked away
126,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Over isle and bay, and. behind"
127,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,On mountains dim-defined.
128,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
129,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"And there twin sisters, fair and young,"
130,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Laughed with their stranger guest, and sung"
131,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,In their native tongue the lays
132,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Of the old Provencal days.
133,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
134,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Alike were they, save the faint outline"
135,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Of a scar on Suzette's forehead fine;
136,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"And both, it so befell,"
137,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Loved the heretic stranger well.
138,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
139,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Both were pleasant to look upon,"
140,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,But the heart of the skipper clave to one;
141,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Though less by his eye than heart
142,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,He knew the twain apart.
143,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
144,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Despite of alien race and creed,"
145,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Well did his wooing of Marguerite speed;
146,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And the mother's wrath was vain
147,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,As the sister's jealous pain.
148,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
149,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The shrill-tongued mistress her house forbade,"
150,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And solemn warning was sternly said
151,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"By the black-robed priest, whose word"
152,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,As law the hamlet heard.
153,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
154,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,But half by voice and half by signs
155,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The skipper said, ""A warm sun shines"
156,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,On the green-banked Merrimac;
157,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Wait, watch, till I come back."
158,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
159,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"""And when you see, from my mast head,"
160,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The signal fly of a kerchief red,"
161,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,My boat on the shore shall wait;
162,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Come, when the night is late."""
163,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
164,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Ah! weighed with childhood's haunts and friends,"
165,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"And all that the home sky overbends,"
166,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Did ever young love fail
167,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,To turn the trembling scale?
168,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
169,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Under the night, on the wet sea sands,"
170,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Slowly unclasped their plighted hands
171,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"One to the cottage hearth,"
172,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And one to his sailor's berth.
173,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
174,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,What was it the parting lovers heard?
175,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Nor leaf, nor ripple, nor wing of bird,"
176,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,But a listener's stealthy tread
177,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"On the rock-moss, crisp and dead."
178,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
179,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"He weighed his anchor, and fished once more"
180,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,By the black coast-line of Labrador;
181,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"And by love and the north wind driven,"
182,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Sailed back to the Islands Seven.
183,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
184,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,In the sunset's glow the sisters twain
185,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Saw the Breeze come sailing in again;
186,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Said Suzette, ""Mother dear,"
187,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The heretic's sail is here."""
188,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
189,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"""Go, Marguerite, to your room, and hide;"
190,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Your door shall be bolted!"" the mother cried:"
191,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"While Suzette, ill at ease,"
192,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Watched the red sign of the Breeze.
193,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
194,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"At midnight, down to the waiting skiff"
195,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,She stole in the shadow of the cliff;
196,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And out of the Bay's mouth ran
197,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,The schooner with maid and man.
198,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
199,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"And all night long, on a restless bed,"
200,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Her prayers to the Virgin Marguerite said
201,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And thought of her lover's pain
202,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Waiting for her in vain.
203,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
204,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Did he pace the sands? Did he pause to hear
205,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,The sound of her light step drawing near?
206,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"And, as the slow hours passed,"
207,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Would he doubt her faith at last?
208,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
209,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"But when she saw through the misty pane,"
210,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The morning break on a sea of rain,"
211,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Could even her love avail
212,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,To follow his vanished sail?
213,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
214,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Meantime the Breeze, with favoring wind,"
215,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Left the rugged Moisic hills behind,"
216,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And heard from an unseen shore
217,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,The falls of Manitou roar.
218,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
219,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"On the morrow's morn, in the thick, gray weather"
220,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"They sat on the reeling deck together,"
221,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Lover and counterfeit,"
222,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Of hapless Marguerite.
223,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
224,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"With a lover's hand, from her forehead fair"
225,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,He smoothed away her jet-black hair.
226,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,What was it his fond eyes met?
227,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,The scar of the false Suzette!
228,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
229,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Fiercely he shouted: ""Bear away"
230,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"East by north for Seven Isles Bay!"""
231,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The maiden wept and prayed,"
232,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,But the ship her helm obeyed.
233,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
234,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Once more the Bay of the Isles they found
235,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"They heard the bell of the chapel sound,"
236,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And the chant of the dying sung
237,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"In the harsh, wild Indian tongue."
238,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
239,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"A feeling of mystery, change, and awe"
240,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Was in all they heard and all they saw
241,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Spell-bound the hamlet lay
242,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,In the hush of its lonely bay.
243,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
244,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"And when they came to the cottage door,"
245,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The mother rose up from her weeping sore,"
246,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And with angry gestures met
247,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,The scared look of Suzette.
248,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
249,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"""Here is your daughter,"" the skipper said;"
250,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"""Give me the one I love instead."""
251,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,But the woman sternly spake;
252,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"""Go, see if the dead will wake!"""
253,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
254,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,He looked. Her sweet face still and white
255,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"And strange in the noonday taper light,"
256,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"She lay on her little bed,"
257,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,With the cross at her feet and head.
258,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
259,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,In a passion of grief the strong man bent
260,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Down to her face, and, kissing it, went"
261,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Back to the waiting Breeze,"
262,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Back to the mournful seas.
263,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
264,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Never again to the Merrimac
265,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And Newbury's homes that bark came back.
266,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Whether her fate she met
267,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"On the shores of Carraquette,"
268,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
269,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Miscou, or Tracadie, who can say?"
270,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,But even yet at Seven Isles Bay
271,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Is told the ghostly tale
272,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Of a weird, unspoken sail,"
273,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
274,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"In the pale, sad light of the Northern day"
275,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Seen by the blanketed Montagnais,"
276,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Or squaw, in her small kyack,"
277,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Crossing the spectre's track.
278,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
279,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,On the deck a maiden wrings her hands;
280,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,Her likeness kneels on the gray coast sands;
281,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"One in her wild despair,"
282,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,And one in the trance of prayer.
283,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,
284,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"She flits before no earthly blast,"
285,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"The red sign fluttering from her mast,"
286,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,"Over the solemn seas,"
287,THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS.,The ghost of the schooner Breeze!

385,RICHARD WALDRON.,This warrant was executed only in Dover and Hampton. At Salisbury the

1196,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"Quick! open, to thy evil world, the glass door of"

1198,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1199,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"The Dwarf obeyed; and youth and Troll down, the"
1200,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"long stair-way passed,"
1201,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,And saw in dim and sunless light a country strange
1202,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,and vast.
1203,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1204,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"Weird, rich, and wonderful, he saw the elfin"

1206,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"Its palaces of precious stones, its streets of golden"
1207,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,sand.
1208,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1209,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,He came unto a banquet-hall with tables richly

1211,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,Where a young maiden served to him the red wine
1212,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,and the bread.
1213,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1214,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,How fair she seemed among the Trolls so ugly and
1215,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,so wild!
1216,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"Yet pale and very sorrowful, like one who never"

1218,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1219,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"Her low, sweet voice, her gold-brown hair, her tender"
1220,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,blue eyes seemed
1221,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,Like something he had seen elsewhere or some.
1222,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,thing he had dreamed.
1223,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1224,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,He looked; he clasped her in his arms; he knew
1225,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,the long-lost one;
1226,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"""O Lisbeth! See thy playmate--I am the"

1228,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1229,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"She leaned her fair head on his breast, and through"

1231,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"""Oh, take me from this evil place, and from the"
1232,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"elfin folk,"
1233,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1234,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"""And let me tread the grass-green fields and smell"
1235,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"the flowers again,"
1236,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,And feel the soft wind on my cheek and hear the
1237,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,dropping rain!
1238,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1239,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"""And oh, to hear the singing bird, the rustling of"
1240,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"the tree,"
1241,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"The lowing cows, the bleat of sheep, the voices of"
1242,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,the sea;
1243,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1244,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"""And oh, upon my father's knee to sit beside the"
1245,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"door,"
1246,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,And hear the bell of vespers ring in Rambin

1248,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1249,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"He kissed her cheek, he kissed her lips; the Brown"
1250,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"Dwarf groaned to see,"
1251,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,And tore his tangled hair and ground his long
1252,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,teeth angrily.
1253,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1254,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"But Deitrich said: ""For five long years this tender"

1258,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1259,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"""Haste!--hither bring me precious gems, the"

1261,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"Then when we pass the gate of glass, you'll take"
1262,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"your cap once more."""
1263,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1264,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"No choice was left the baffled Troll, and, murmuring,"
1265,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"he obeyed,"
1266,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,And filled the pockets of the youth and apron of
1267,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,the maid.
1268,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1269,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,They left the dreadful under-land and passed the

1271,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"They felt the sunshine's warm caress, they trod the"
1272,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"soft, green grass."
1273,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1274,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"And when, beneath, they saw the Dwarf stretch up"

1278,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1279,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,"Oh, never shone so bright a sun, was never sky so"

1283,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,
1284,THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN.,And never sang the birds so sweet in Rambin's
