40,PREFACE.,
41,PREFACE.,"The tragedy at the end of the volume, is founded upon an incident well"
42,PREFACE.,"known in the history of Venice, which has formed the material for"
43,PREFACE.,various works of fiction. Niccolini has written a classic play upon the

45,PREFACE.,"of the first scene of the first act, and in a few occasional passages"
46,PREFACE.,"of scene first of the fifth act. The conduct of the plot, and the"
47,PREFACE.,"leading incidents, differ materially from those of Niccolini."
48,PREFACE.,
49,PREFACE.,The author takes this opportunity to render her grateful
50,PREFACE.,"acknowledgments to the distinguished lady, Miss Phillips, who sustained"
51,PREFACE.,the part of the heroine; and to whose talents and exertions the play

2782,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Roved the free woods, and dreamed not of the day"
2783,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],When pale invaders should profane his home--
2784,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],An Indian maiden bloomed--among those tribes

2790,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Their forest huts to dance in the green glade,"
2791,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],Or pluck the wild flowers on the hillock sheen.
2792,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"She was beloved by rivals of her tribe,"
2793,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],And for a season smiled alike on both.
2794,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],The one was bright and joyous as herself;
2795,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],He loved to bring her flowers--to snare with her
2796,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],The fish that sparkled in the silvery stream;
2797,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"To range the wood or shore, and rifle thence"
2798,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Some delicate feather, or some purple shell,"
2799,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],To please a maiden’s fancy.--But his rival

2801,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"His was the skill to wield the hunter’s bow,"

2804,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],To make its wide depths echo with the shriek
2805,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],Of slaughtered foes. His name was feared and hated
2806,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],Among the neighbouring tribes. The maid was proud
2807,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],That one so stern and terrible as he
2808,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Should own her power--and though she loved him not,"
2809,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],She still would smile and listen when he told
2810,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"His fierce exploits, and boasted deeds sublime."
2811,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Time passed, and she grew weary of his gloom,"
2812,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],And laughed to scorn his face of sullenness;
2813,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],And when at dusky eve his step was heard
2814,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Approaching, she would quit her cottage home"
2815,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],To shun his sight;--and seek the thicket’s shade
2816,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],To meet her gentler lover.
2817,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],One bright sun-set
2818,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"She waited for his coming. Hours passed on,"
2819,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"And the gray twilight faded from the hills,"
2820,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],And from the sheltered valley. Still he came not.
2821,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],She turned to seek her home--when at her side
2822,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"A figure stood, panting with breathless haste."
2823,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"’Twas he, the dark browed youth. His eye was wild,"
2824,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],Blood on his forehead--and his reeking weapon
2825,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Of the same crimson hue. She shrunk aghast,"
2826,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],For her fears told what blood had dyed that blade.
2827,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"With unresisted might he bore her thence,"
2828,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Fleet as the eagle, to the dusky shore."
2829,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],Ere she had power to shriek--to strive--to pray--
2830,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],She was upon the wide and silent waters
2831,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Alone with him. The night was gathering fast,"
2832,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"And as their bark shot onward, o’er them rose"
2833,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Those massive rocks, shadowy and stern as now--"
2834,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"On whose bleak sides the winds swept tremulously,"
2835,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],And the dark wave broke on the stormy barrier
2836,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Foaming and furious. As they neared the cliff,"
2837,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],The sky was black with clouds--and hopelessly
2838,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],The maiden struggled with her fearful foe.
2839,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],They touched the frowning rock.--He rose to moor
2840,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"His vessel to its side. A blasted bough,"
2841,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Sole remnant of the cedar’s giant pride,"
2842,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"He caught--it fell--the billow urged them on,"
2843,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],And high above the rushing waters’ moan
2844,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],Sounded her shriek--as o’er the dashing waves
2845,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],They entered that wild chasm.
2846,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],They were seen
2847,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"No more; nor when the sunny morn looked forth,"
2848,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Was trace e’er found of that ill-fated pair,"
2849,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],The maiden and the murderer. Some have said
2850,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],That both soon perished in the cavern’s depths--
2851,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"Others, that still at midnight may be seen"
2852,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"That bark with its dread tenants, gliding slow"
2853,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],O’er the hushed wave! Yet--false or sooth the tale--
2854,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"No wandering peasant now at twilight’s hour,"
2855,THE PICTURED ROCKS.[14],"When silence hallows the pure lake’s repose,"

3541,NOTES.,
3542,NOTES.,This poem was composed by Foscolo during a temporary retirement to
3543,NOTES.,"Brescia, in Northern Italy. The occasion which called it forth was"
3544,NOTES.,"a law passed about that time in the Italian kingdom, directing that"
3545,NOTES.,"all burials should take place without the confines of the cities,"
3546,NOTES.,"forbidding inscriptions or any mark of distinction upon the graves,"
3547,NOTES.,and prohibiting the approach of visiters to the cemeteries. Though
3548,NOTES.,intended to obviate the inconveniencies arising from the ancient
3549,NOTES.,"custom of interring the dead in the churches, this law was carried to"
3550,NOTES.,an arbitrary and unnecessary extreme; for it consigned the departed
3551,NOTES.,"to one indiscriminate place of sepulture, and denied to the mourner"
3552,NOTES.,"the last consolation of grief. Our poet, fired with indignation at"
3553,NOTES.,"this sacrilegious infringement of the solemn rights of nature, gave"
3554,NOTES.,"utterance to his feelings in the work just mentioned, in which he"
3555,NOTES.,dwells on the salutary influence over the living of their veneration
3556,NOTES.,for the dead; and proves the mischievous effects of that policy
3557,NOTES.,which would invade the sacredness of a sentiment so holy.--_American

3857,FOSCARINI.,FOSCARINI.
3858,FOSCARINI.,
3859,FOSCARINI.,I do prize your goodness:
3860,FOSCARINI.,Will tax it for one boon. There is a maid
3861,FOSCARINI.,"Within this town, I speak not of her beauty,"
3862,FOSCARINI.,"For that were idle, and you’d smile perchance,"

3869,DOGE.,
3870,FOSCARINI.,FOSCARINI.
3871,FOSCARINI.,
3872,FOSCARINI.,She is the daughter of Veniero;
3873,FOSCARINI.,"All Venice knows his feud with Loredano,"
3874,FOSCARINI.,Their strife and hate. My suit is briefly this--
3875,FOSCARINI.,"From Loredano and his secret arts,"
3876,FOSCARINI.,Protect Teresa and her sire.
3877,FOSCARINI.,
3878,DOGE.,DOGE.
3879,DOGE.,
3880,DOGE.,You ask
3881,DOGE.,"As if the Doge did govern here, and were not"

3883,DOGE.,Over their safety.
3884,DOGE.,

3925,VINCENTIO.,"Aye, like the gods too, that their cunning visits"

3929,VINCENTIO.,"In such concealed bondage! ’Twas but now,"
3930,VINCENTIO.,"Even at the masque, I saw the peering eyes"
3931,VINCENTIO.,"Of that dark villain, Steno, fixed upon me."
3932,VINCENTIO.,I’ve marked him oft--he serves the state in secret!
3933,VINCENTIO.,"Mine arm ached for the dagger, as I watched"

3980,LOREDANO.,LOREDANO.
3981,LOREDANO.,I am not wont
3982,LOREDANO.,To let them move me. In another age
3983,LOREDANO.,"The stain of insult must be washed with blood,"
3984,LOREDANO.,"Or it grew rank, and spread unsightliness"
3985,LOREDANO.,"On him that bore it. Now, though thrice reviled,"
3986,LOREDANO.,"Thrice, at the banquet, in these times the steel"
3987,LOREDANO.,’Tis dangerous to wield. Hate is resisted

3989,LOREDANO.,
3990,CONTARINI.,CONTARINI.
3991,CONTARINI.,
3992,CONTARINI.,And let wisdom vanquish hate.

4000,CONTARINI.,CONTARINI.
4001,CONTARINI.,
4002,CONTARINI.,Fiorilla!
4003,CONTARINI.,Shame! in a tone where bitterness so lately
4004,CONTARINI.,"Hath dwelt, to breathe her name--were not that name"
4005,CONTARINI.,Of power to sweeten all! Hear but her voice--
4006,CONTARINI.,"Oh! the dull spheres, to hear it, might descend,"
4007,CONTARINI.,Lessoned by music sweeter than their own!
4008,CONTARINI.,"’Twill charm the evil spirit from your soul,"
4009,CONTARINI.,As the enamored bard of old beguiled
4010,CONTARINI.,"Hell’s guilty prisoners to a transient bliss,"
4011,CONTARINI.,And won the bride he loved from Pluto’s arms!
4012,CONTARINI.,

4019,CONTARINI.,"Nay--to shrines so fair,"
4020,CONTARINI.,"Kneeling, we offer passionate vows, but dream not"

4024,CONTARINI.,"Or if he might, would not the dazzling tide"
4025,CONTARINI.,O’erwhelm his votary? Fiorilla’s charms
4026,CONTARINI.,Were never made for one--and all who share
4027,CONTARINI.,"The sunlight of her smile, may bask in safety;"
4028,CONTARINI.,It shines on all alike.

4030,LOREDANO.,LOREDANO.
4031,LOREDANO.,
4032,LOREDANO.,You know I seek not

4062,CONTARINI.,To night my vows I pay where hundreds more
4063,CONTARINI.,Will emulate my worship. Will you go?

4070,CONTARINI.,
4071,CONTARINI.,He’ll serve my purpose well.
4072,CONTARINI.,His anger is well-timed: it gives a color
4073,CONTARINI.,"To my intent, which makes all doubly sure."
4074,CONTARINI.,This for the marble that so meetly yawns
4075,CONTARINI.,For secret accusations. Loredano

4357,‘VENIERO.,"‘Thou hast thrown off the garb of joyous girlhood,"
4358,‘VENIERO.,‘And donned a statelier one. A riper rose
4359,‘VENIERO.,‘Deepens upon thy cheek. Thine eye can flash
4360,‘VENIERO.,‘From its clear depth of blue such meanings forth

4381,‘TERESA.,
4382,‘TERESA.,‘Nay--nay--you wrong me

4434,VENIERO.,"To sue, who could command; and offers you"
4435,VENIERO.,"His greatness and his power, claiming your hand"

4444,VENIERO.,Come--come--displease me not. What state is proffered

4446,VENIERO.,Why--not a maid in Venice but will gaze
4447,VENIERO.,"In envy on your pomp, as you flaunt by,"
4448,VENIERO.,A queen in all but name! Wed Contarini!

4464,VENIERO.,"And know’st not that to such as he, his passion"
4465,VENIERO.,Is an idolatry? Oh! when time has checked
4466,VENIERO.,"The blood’s swift current, and made pale the brow"
4467,VENIERO.,"With lofty thought, and blanched stern manhood’s locks,"
4468,VENIERO.,"Love comes with boundless power, and sways the heart"
4469,VENIERO.,"A sole, unrivalled sovereign. How doth youth"
4470,VENIERO.,Wear his soft yoke? More lightly than he wears
4471,VENIERO.,"The pageant plume, which every fickle wind"
4472,VENIERO.,"Stirs at its will, to be thrown careless by,"
4473,VENIERO.,When he shall weary of its pride! To youth
4474,VENIERO.,"Love is the shallow rill that mocks the sunshine,"

4476,VENIERO.,"To age, the river, silent, broad, and deep--"

4478,VENIERO.,Baffling the vain eye that would read its depths--

4513,TERESA.,"Some wrong is here. Nay, Signors, ye have sought"
4514,TERESA.,"A culprit--not Veniero, old Veniero,"
4515,TERESA.,Whose head is grey in service of the state!
4516,TERESA.,"The friend of Contarini, too! but now"

4530,VENIERO.,St. Mark will ne’er condemn one who has prized

4809,TERESA.,“Traitor” and “treachery!” They mean nought--at least
4810,TERESA.,Nought--coupled with his name! Listen to me.
4811,TERESA.,I’ve known him long--longer than any here.
4812,TERESA.,He reared my childhood. I have sate by him
4813,TERESA.,"In hours of fondness, when the careless words"
4814,TERESA.,"Fell from his lips unnoted, save by me:--"
4815,TERESA.,Think you he would deceive me? No! I’ll pledge
4816,TERESA.,"Life, more than life, upon his truth!"

4819,BADOERO.,
4820,BADOERO.,Nay--lady;
4821,BADOERO.,This cannot aught avail. Trust in our justice.
4822,BADOERO.,That shall be rendered him. If we fail not
4823,BADOERO.,"To rend the veil from guilt, we are not slow"
4824,BADOERO.,To acquit the innocent.

4826,TERESA.,TERESA.

4853,TERESA.,

4859,CONTARINI.,
4860,CONTARINI.,Hear me yet a moment.

4887,TERESA.,
4888,TERESA.,Is this the noble
4889,TERESA.,So honored? This the haughty senator?
4890,TERESA.,Ready to barter in his selfishness
4891,TERESA.,The trust he holds? Bearing the solemn charge--
4892,TERESA.,A nation’s safety--laden with the prayers
4893,TERESA.,"Of suppliant millions, on his truth who rest"
4894,TERESA.,Their hopes--their all--yet ready to fling down
4895,TERESA.,"The mighty burthen, if it impede the way"

4930,VENIERO.,"Remember, to admit my child. Retire. [_Exit_ BELTRAMO."
4931,VENIERO.,"A dark dawn, truly, for the gorgeous day"
4932,VENIERO.,That waits upon my fortunes; but its noon
4933,VENIERO.,Will shine the brighter. Can he fail me now?
4934,VENIERO.,I scarce would trust his plighted word alone!
4935,VENIERO.,"But, were it not that breath of mine could blow"
4936,VENIERO.,"His fabric of ambition to the winds,"
4937,VENIERO.,I’ve yet another hold; he loves the girl
4938,VENIERO.,Whose fair young hand must bind this wreath of glory
4939,VENIERO.,Around her brows and mine.--She is here. This hour

4956,VENIERO.,Poor welcome; yet thy loveliness breaks in
4957,VENIERO.,"Upon my prison’s gloom, like the fresh light"
4958,VENIERO.,Of morning to the hopeless. Weep not for me!
4959,VENIERO.,Why--foolish child! will tears undo these bars?
4960,VENIERO.,"They are of massive weight, and have withstood"
4961,VENIERO.,"In ancient service past, more briny floods"
4962,VENIERO.,"Than would have drowned this cell, save that the earth"
4963,VENIERO.,"Drank the hot tide of anguish as it gushed,--"
4964,VENIERO.,More thirsty now than ever! Let me pass
4965,VENIERO.,Nearer that side--methinks a freer air

4974,VENIERO.,VENIERO.
4975,VENIERO.,
4976,VENIERO.,’Tis nought!
4977,VENIERO.,I do not tremble. Yet I’m sick at heart
4978,VENIERO.,To look upon this dungeon--knowing here

4990,VENIERO.,Alas! you know them not; know not that here
4991,VENIERO.,Who is suspected is already doomed.
4992,VENIERO.,"’Tis hard that I should perish thus, the scorn"

5012,CONTARINI.,"So specious and so startling, it were madness"

5279,TERESA.,"The pen, my hand refuses to record"
5280,TERESA.,"The tale it ought to tell. Oh, fatal hand!"
5281,TERESA.,"Which soon must seal my shame, well dost thou shrink"
5282,TERESA.,To do the accusing office!--Foscarini!
5283,TERESA.,Yet may I breathe that name! the walls about me
5284,TERESA.,"Will not yet hear it as a guilty sound,"
5285,TERESA.,"But softly echo back the whispered word,"
5286,TERESA.,As if their stones could pity!--
5287,TERESA.,To-night! to-night!
5288,TERESA.,"I’m strangely calm. So long I’ve pondered on it,"
5289,TERESA.,"It seems that even despair has lost its keenness,"
5290,TERESA.,And only sits a thick and leaden weight
5291,TERESA.,"Upon my soul. I’ve wept, alas! so much,"
5292,TERESA.,"The founts of grief are dry, and will not yield"
5293,TERESA.,A drop to soften me!
5294,TERESA.,
5295,TERESA.,_Enter_ MATILDA.
5296,TERESA.,
5297,TERESA.,Why have you come?
5298,TERESA.,
5299,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5300,MATILDA.,
5301,MATILDA.,Forgive me--’tis not meet
5302,MATILDA.,You should be left alone with sombre thoughts
5303,MATILDA.,At such an hour.
5304,MATILDA.,
5305,TERESA.,TERESA.
5306,TERESA.,
5307,TERESA.,It is not late.
5308,TERESA.,
5309,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5310,MATILDA.,
5311,MATILDA.,Look out--
5312,MATILDA.,The sun has long since set.
5313,MATILDA.,
5314,TERESA.,TERESA.
5315,TERESA.,
5316,TERESA.,Some envious cloud
5317,TERESA.,"It is, that hides his beams."
5318,TERESA.,
5319,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5320,MATILDA.,
5321,MATILDA.,No! it is night--
5322,MATILDA.,"The summit of yon gilded cupola,"
5323,MATILDA.,"Where last the hues of sunset ever linger,"
5324,MATILDA.,Has long been wrapt in gloom!
5325,MATILDA.,
5326,TERESA.,TERESA.
5327,TERESA.,
5328,TERESA.,Is it not strange
5329,TERESA.,I should regret the daylight?
5330,TERESA.,
5331,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5332,MATILDA.,
5333,MATILDA.,Come--no more
5334,MATILDA.,Of these sad musings. You have cherished them
5335,MATILDA.,"’Till your fair cheek is pale, and unbecoming"
5336,MATILDA.,"A youthful bride. Why look--these radiant pearls,"
5337,MATILDA.,Whose pure transparence should have suited well
5338,MATILDA.,"With your fresh brow, will find their whiteness shamed."
5339,MATILDA.,
5340,TERESA.,TERESA.
5341,TERESA.,
5342,TERESA.,Matilda!
5343,TERESA.,
5344,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5345,MATILDA.,
5346,MATILDA.,Here--these flowers are fresh; I’ll wreathe them
5347,MATILDA.,In the full wavings of your hair. I’ll braid it
5348,MATILDA.,"In dark, rich folds upon your temples. Ah!"
5349,MATILDA.,"That form, so stately, yet so full of grace,"
5350,MATILDA.,That high fair front--they will indeed proclaim you
5351,MATILDA.,"The queen of loveliness, to every eye"
5352,MATILDA.,That seeks you in its homage!
5353,MATILDA.,
5354,TERESA.,TERESA.
5355,TERESA.,
5356,TERESA.,Hush! Matilda--
5357,TERESA.,Waste not your idle praises.
5358,TERESA.,
5359,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5360,MATILDA.,
5361,MATILDA.,I will keep them
5362,MATILDA.,For other ears. But should I not be proud
5363,MATILDA.,To deck you for your nuptials?
5364,MATILDA.,
5365,MATILDA.,TERESA (_shuddering_.)
5366,MATILDA.,
5367,MATILDA.,No!
5368,MATILDA.,
5369,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5370,MATILDA.,
5371,MATILDA.,Look not
5372,MATILDA.,So sadly. True--you love not Contarini;--
5373,MATILDA.,"But who among us thinks to wed for love,"
5374,MATILDA.,"When wealth, and rank, and power, and all that’s dear"
5375,MATILDA.,"To woman’s heart, do beckon us to seize them!"
5376,MATILDA.,"Oh! trust me! love’s a bauble, fit to toy with--"
5377,MATILDA.,"But like the shining plaything of the child,"
5378,MATILDA.,"To be thrown by, when riper years bestow"
5379,MATILDA.,"Far richer gifts, and teach him ’twas a trifle"
5380,MATILDA.,He prized before!
5381,MATILDA.,
5382,TERESA.,TERESA.
5383,TERESA.,
5384,TERESA.,"Nay, nay--I need not this."
5385,TERESA.,My heart is senseless. It is cold--cold--cold!
5386,TERESA.,"Steeled in an apathy more deep than wo,"
5387,TERESA.,Which even keen thought can never pierce again.
5388,TERESA.,"What nights of feverish unrest I’ve borne,"
5389,TERESA.,"What days of weeping and of bitterness,"
5390,TERESA.,"When I have schooled me to a mocking calmness,"
5391,TERESA.,While my heart ached within! But all is past!
5392,TERESA.,My spirit is a waste o’er which hath raged
5393,TERESA.,"The desolating fire, to leave its trace"
5394,TERESA.,In blackened ruins!--I can feel no more!
5395,TERESA.,Would that I could! I’d rather bear the gnawing
5396,TERESA.,"Of anguish, than this dull, dead, frozen void,"
5397,TERESA.,In which all sense is buried!
5398,TERESA.,
5399,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5400,MATILDA.,
5401,MATILDA.,Would the harp
5402,MATILDA.,Soothe you? or shall I sing those cheerful songs
5403,MATILDA.,That once you loved to hear?
5404,MATILDA.,
5405,TERESA.,TERESA.
5406,TERESA.,
5407,TERESA.,No--no--the sound
5408,TERESA.,"Would be a mockery.--Yet, if time urge not,"
5409,TERESA.,I’d have you read to me that mournful tale
5410,TERESA.,We oft have read together--of a maid
5411,TERESA.,"Compelled like me to nuptials she abhorred,--"
5412,TERESA.,"Who fled to death’s arms to escape that bridal,"
5413,TERESA.,And sleeps within the grave of him she loved.
5414,TERESA.,
5415,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5416,MATILDA.,
5417,MATILDA.,Nay--nay--you shall not hear so sad a story!
5418,MATILDA.,
5419,TERESA.,TERESA.
5420,TERESA.,
5421,TERESA.,"It cannot move me. Hers was a bold spirit,"
5422,TERESA.,"That dared to spurn the chain, and purchase peace"
5423,TERESA.,Even at the price of life.--Would I could be
5424,TERESA.,Like her!
5425,TERESA.,
5426,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5427,MATILDA.,
5428,MATILDA.,Teresa!
5429,MATILDA.,
5430,TERESA.,TERESA.
5431,TERESA.,
5432,TERESA.,Fear me not--my hands
5433,TERESA.,Are cowards; ‘and my veins were never meant
5434,TERESA.,‘To flow with blood like that which nourishes
5435,TERESA.,"‘Heroic hearts.’--There’s something in death’s aspect,"
5436,TERESA.,"Even when he smiles, that human spirits quail at!"
5437,TERESA.,"‘The foolish skin doth creep--and the frame shudder,"
5438,TERESA.,‘At thought of what awaits them--the dusk pall--

5441,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5442,MATILDA.,
5443,MATILDA.,Holy St. Mary! Are such thoughts as these
5444,MATILDA.,Meet for a festival?
5445,MATILDA.,
5446,TERESA.,TERESA.
5447,TERESA.,
5448,TERESA.,A festival!
5449,TERESA.,True--there’s a noble festival at hand!
5450,TERESA.,Yes--yes--I will be passive.--Deck me out
5451,TERESA.,"A victim--oh, how truly!--At the altar,"
5452,TERESA.,Say--must I wear a smile!
5453,TERESA.,
5454,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5455,MATILDA.,
5456,MATILDA.,Oh! not like that!
5457,MATILDA.,No--do not smile--the veil will hide your face.--
5458,MATILDA.,
5459,TERESA.,TERESA.
5460,TERESA.,
5461,TERESA.,Will it? that’s well.--I fear me it would shame
5462,TERESA.,The gay surrounding group.--They are not wont
5463,TERESA.,To see such revellers. My looks would wither
5464,TERESA.,More roses than will deck the festal hall!
5465,TERESA.,
5466,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5467,MATILDA.,
5468,MATILDA.,Talk not so strangely!
5469,MATILDA.,
5470,TERESA.,TERESA.
5471,TERESA.,
5472,TERESA.,Strangely? am I changed?

5477,MATILDA.,
5478,TERESA.,TERESA.
5479,TERESA.,
5480,TERESA.,I rejoice--I would be changed!

5510,SCENE III.,
5511,FOSCARINI.,FOSCARINI.
5512,FOSCARINI.,
5513,FOSCARINI.,Once more in Venice! How my native air
5514,FOSCARINI.,Takes from these limbs their weariness! What were
5515,FOSCARINI.,"The breezes of the rugged Alps, to this,"
5516,FOSCARINI.,"So bland--so wooing? All, in loveliness"
5517,FOSCARINI.,"The same--the same! The Lagune, brightly clear,"
5518,FOSCARINI.,Yet mirrors in its depths the marble domes
5519,FOSCARINI.,That rise above it--lordly towers--where shine
5520,FOSCARINI.,"A thousand torches, like so many stars"
5521,FOSCARINI.,"Gleaming through clouds of silver. From afar,"
5522,FOSCARINI.,"The surge-like tone of multitudes, the hum"
5523,FOSCARINI.,"Of glad, familiar voices, and the wild"
5524,FOSCARINI.,"Faint music of the happy gondolier,"
5525,FOSCARINI.,Float up in blended murmurs. Queen of cities!
5526,FOSCARINI.,Goddess of ocean! with the beauty crowned
5527,FOSCARINI.,Of Aphrodite from her parent deep!
5528,FOSCARINI.,If thine Ausonian heaven denies the strength
5529,FOSCARINI.,"That nerves a mountain race of sterner mould,"
5530,FOSCARINI.,It gives thee charms whose very softness wins
5531,FOSCARINI.,All hearts to worship!
5532,FOSCARINI.,
5533,FOSCARINI.,_Enter_ VINCENTIO.
5534,FOSCARINI.,
5535,FOSCARINI.,By this light--Vincentio?
5536,FOSCARINI.,"Whence come you, signor?"
5537,FOSCARINI.,
5538,VINCENTIO.,VINCENTIO.

5545,FOSCARINI.,What news are stirring?
5546,FOSCARINI.,
5547,VINCENTIO.,VINCENTIO.
5548,VINCENTIO.,
5549,VINCENTIO.,None--of note.
5550,VINCENTIO.,
5551,FOSCARINI.,FOSCARINI.
5552,FOSCARINI.,
5553,FOSCARINI.,You come
5554,FOSCARINI.,I augur by your garb--from some late festival?
5555,FOSCARINI.,
5556,VINCENTIO.,VINCENTIO.
5557,VINCENTIO.,
5558,VINCENTIO.,A bridal. One of our first citizens
5559,VINCENTIO.,To-night doth wed his daughter--and assembles
5560,VINCENTIO.,"The prime of Venice. Light, and flowers, and smiles,"
5561,VINCENTIO.,Soon wearied me--who am not wont to toy
5562,VINCENTIO.,My hours away in mirth.
5563,VINCENTIO.,
5564,FOSCARINI.,FOSCARINI.
5565,FOSCARINI.,
5566,FOSCARINI.,"Then, splenetic,"
5567,FOSCARINI.,You left the joyous scene?
5568,FOSCARINI.,
5569,VINCENTIO.,VINCENTIO.
5570,VINCENTIO.,
5571,VINCENTIO.,’Twas not all joy.
5572,VINCENTIO.,"If I mistake not, with the flowers that wrought"
5573,VINCENTIO.,"The bridal wreath, some leaves of bitterness"
5574,VINCENTIO.,Were mingled.
5575,VINCENTIO.,
5576,FOSCARINI.,FOSCARINI.

5578,FOSCARINI.,Ha!
5579,FOSCARINI.,
5580,VINCENTIO.,VINCENTIO.
5581,VINCENTIO.,
5582,VINCENTIO.,The bridegroom rich and noble--
5583,VINCENTIO.,The father proud and pleased--the guests all smiling--
5584,VINCENTIO.,"But the mute bride!--I could not see her face,"
5585,VINCENTIO.,"But in her drooping form, like a bowed lily--"
5586,VINCENTIO.,"Her passive mien, and strange unconsciousness,"
5587,VINCENTIO.,I read far more than bashfulness.
5588,VINCENTIO.,
5589,FOSCARINI.,FOSCARINI.
5590,FOSCARINI.,
5591,FOSCARINI.,Indeed!
5592,FOSCARINI.,
5593,VINCENTIO.,VINCENTIO.
5594,VINCENTIO.,
5595,VINCENTIO.,Before the altar she might have been deemed
5596,VINCENTIO.,A life like statue. From her veiled lips
5597,VINCENTIO.,"Her words came slow and solemn, as the oracle"
5598,VINCENTIO.,Speaks from its cloudy shrine.--Oh! much I fear
5599,VINCENTIO.,"The fathers of our city are grown stern,"
5600,VINCENTIO.,And sacrifice to gold and foul ambition
5601,VINCENTIO.,Treasures of youthful love.
5602,VINCENTIO.,
5603,VINCENTIO.,FOSCARINI (_aside_.)
5604,VINCENTIO.,

5607,VINCENTIO.,
5608,VINCENTIO.,VINCENTIO.
5609,VINCENTIO.,
5610,VINCENTIO.,Is stern and haughty--though in courtesy
5611,VINCENTIO.,Well skilled--as noble senator should be. (_ironically._)
5612,VINCENTIO.,
5613,FOSCARINI.,FOSCARINI.
5614,FOSCARINI.,
5615,FOSCARINI.,A senator? his name----

5617,VINCENTIO.,VINCENTIO.
5618,VINCENTIO.,
5619,VINCENTIO.,’Tis Contarini--
5620,VINCENTIO.,A synonyme for all that’s merciful! (_sneeringly._)

5631,FOSCARINI.,
5632,FOSCARINI.,No more!
5633,FOSCARINI.,Or I shall stop your breath! begone!
5634,FOSCARINI.,
5635,VINCENTIO.,VINCENTIO.
5636,VINCENTIO.,

5638,VINCENTIO.,
5639,FOSCARINI.,FOSCARINI.
5640,FOSCARINI.,
5641,FOSCARINI.,Hence! you have basely slandered her--the fairest--
5642,FOSCARINI.,The truest.--No! ’twas not Teresa! speak!
5643,FOSCARINI.,You have mistaken her name?
5644,FOSCARINI.,
5645,VINCENTIO.,VINCENTIO.
5646,VINCENTIO.,
5647,VINCENTIO.,I spoke the truth--
5648,VINCENTIO.,Veniero’s daughter.
5649,VINCENTIO.,
5650,FOSCARINI.,FOSCARINI.
5651,FOSCARINI.,
5652,FOSCARINI.,Well--begone and leave me!
5653,FOSCARINI.,
5654,FOSCARINI.,(_Exit_ VINCENTIO. FOSCARINI _paces the scene a few moments in
5655,FOSCARINI.,silence--then suddenly stops_.)
5656,FOSCARINI.,
5657,FOSCARINI.,"If this be true, I’ll seek her--I’ll confront her--"
5658,FOSCARINI.,I’ll blast her sight--and drag her from his arms.
5659,FOSCARINI.,E’en at their bridal feast inflict the penalty
5660,FOSCARINI.,Of guile like hers. Away. [_Exit._

6274,TERESA.,Why--that’s well--
6275,TERESA.,If burning sorrow could dry up life’s springs--
6276,TERESA.,But they flow on--though every fount is sealed
6277,TERESA.,That could renew them. Strange--that life should cling

6279,TERESA.,"And mock its tenement, though that be worn"

6315,TERESA.,When the fierce tempest blackened it--and hoped--
6316,TERESA.,And hoped its wings would sweep thee to destruction!
6317,TERESA.,Invoked the hoary mountain rocks to crush thee!
6318,TERESA.,"Prayed, as I ne’er before have prayed for weal"

6351,TERESA.,"That haunted me, and mocked my tears! No--no!"
6352,TERESA.,"Thy pity, like the angel of Heaven’s mercy,"
6353,TERESA.,Will smile--and smile--and soothe me as I pass

6358,FOSCARINI.,FOSCARINI.
6359,FOSCARINI.,

6371,FOSCARINI.,You are mine! Good spirits have heard
