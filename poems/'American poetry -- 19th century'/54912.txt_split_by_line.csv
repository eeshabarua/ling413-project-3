56,_TO S. M. D._,
57,_TO S. M. D._,_Let us go forth and gather golden-rod!
58,_TO S. M. D._,"O love, my love, see how upon the hills,"
59,_TO S. M. D._,"Where still the warm air palpitates and thrills,"
60,_TO S. M. D._,"And earth lies breathless in the smile of God,"
61,_TO S. M. D._,Like plumes of serried hosts its tassels nod!
62,_TO S. M. D._,All the green vales its golden glory fills;
63,_TO S. M. D._,By lonely waysides and by mountain rills
64,_TO S. M. D._,Its yellow banners flaunt above the sod.
65,_TO S. M. D._,Perhaps the apple-blossoms were more fair;
66,_TO S. M. D._,"Perhaps, dear heart, the roses were more sweet,"
67,_TO S. M. D._,"June’s dewy roses, with their buds half blown;"
68,_TO S. M. D._,"Yet what care we, while tremulous and rare"
69,_TO S. M. D._,This golden sunshine falleth at our feet
70,_TO S. M. D._,"And song lives on, though summer birds have flown?"
71,_TO S. M. D._,"August, 1884._"
72,_TO S. M. D._,
73,_TO S. M. D._,"_Let the words stand as they were writ, dear heart!"
74,_TO S. M. D._,Although no more for thee in earthly bowers
75,_TO S. M. D._,Shall bloom the earlier or the later flowers;
76,_TO S. M. D._,"Although to-day ’tis springtime where thou art,"
77,_TO S. M. D._,"While I, with Autumn, wander far apart,"
78,_TO S. M. D._,"Yet, in the name of that long love of ours,"
79,_TO S. M. D._,"Tested by years and tried by sun and showers,"
80,_TO S. M. D._,"Let the words stand as they were writ, dear heart!_"

359,THE THREE SHIPS,Crimson and amber and amethyst.

383,THE THREE SHIPS,And the decks were stained with earthly moil?
384,THE THREE SHIPS,
385,THE THREE SHIPS,"Oh, beautiful ships, that sailed that night"
386,THE THREE SHIPS,"Into the west from our yearning sight,"
387,THE THREE SHIPS,
388,THE THREE SHIPS,Full well I know that the freight ye bore
389,THE THREE SHIPS,Was laden not for an earthly shore!
390,THE THREE SHIPS,
391,THE THREE SHIPS,"To some far realm ye were sailing on,"
392,THE THREE SHIPS,Where all we have lost shall yet be won;
393,THE THREE SHIPS,
394,THE THREE SHIPS,"Ye were bearing thither a world of dreams,"
395,THE THREE SHIPS,Bright as that sunset’s golden gleams;
396,THE THREE SHIPS,
397,THE THREE SHIPS,"And hopes whose tremulous, rosy flush,"
398,THE THREE SHIPS,Grew fairer still in the twilight hush.
399,THE THREE SHIPS,
400,THE THREE SHIPS,Ye were bearing hence to that mystic sphere
401,THE THREE SHIPS,"Thoughts no mortal may utter here,—"
402,THE THREE SHIPS,
403,THE THREE SHIPS,"Songs that on earth may not be sung,—"
404,THE THREE SHIPS,"Words too holy for human tongue,—"
405,THE THREE SHIPS,
406,THE THREE SHIPS,"The golden deeds that we would have done,—"
407,THE THREE SHIPS,The fadeless wreaths that we would have won!
408,THE THREE SHIPS,
409,THE THREE SHIPS,And hence it was that our souls with you
410,THE THREE SHIPS,"Traversed the measureless waste of blue,"
411,THE THREE SHIPS,
412,THE THREE SHIPS,"Till you passed under the sunset gate,"
413,THE THREE SHIPS,"And to us a voice said, softly, “Wait!”"

448,MAUD AND MADGE,You read her fate in her weary face.
449,MAUD AND MADGE,Up with the dawn to toil all day
450,MAUD AND MADGE,For meagre fare and a place to sleep;
451,MAUD AND MADGE,"Seldom a moment to dream or play,"
452,MAUD AND MADGE,Little leisure to laugh or weep.

454,MAUD AND MADGE,"Beautiful Maud, you think, maybe,"
455,MAUD AND MADGE,"Lying back in your velvet chair,"
456,MAUD AND MADGE,"There is naught in common with her and thee,—"
457,MAUD AND MADGE,You scarce could breathe in the self-same air.
458,MAUD AND MADGE,But the warm blood in her girlish heart
459,MAUD AND MADGE,"Leaps quick as yours at her nature’s call,"
460,MAUD AND MADGE,"And ye, though moving so far apart,"
461,MAUD AND MADGE,Must share one destiny after all.
462,MAUD AND MADGE,
463,MAUD AND MADGE,"Love shall come to you both one day,"
464,MAUD AND MADGE,For still must be what aye hath been;
465,MAUD AND MADGE,And under satin or russet gray
466,MAUD AND MADGE,Hearts will open to let him in.
467,MAUD AND MADGE,Motherhood with its joy and woe
468,MAUD AND MADGE,"Each must compass through burning pain,—"
469,MAUD AND MADGE,"You, fair Maud, with your brow of snow,"
470,MAUD AND MADGE,Madge with her brown hands labor-stained.
471,MAUD AND MADGE,
472,MAUD AND MADGE,"Each shall sorrow and each shall weep,"
473,MAUD AND MADGE,"Though one is in hovel, one in hall;"
474,MAUD AND MADGE,"Over your gold the frost shall creep,"
475,MAUD AND MADGE,As over her jet the snows will fall.
476,MAUD AND MADGE,"Exquisite Maud, you lift your eyes"
477,MAUD AND MADGE,At Madge out yonder under the sun;
478,MAUD AND MADGE,Yet know ye both by the countless ties
479,MAUD AND MADGE,Of a common womanhood ye are one!

523,OVER THE WALL,There all day long does the honey-bee
524,OVER THE WALL,Murmur and hum in the hollow tree.
525,OVER THE WALL,
526,OVER THE WALL,And there the feathery hemlock makes
527,OVER THE WALL,"A shadow cool and sweet,"
528,OVER THE WALL,While from its emerald wing it shakes
529,OVER THE WALL,Rare incense at your feet.
530,OVER THE WALL,"There do the silvery lichens cling,"
531,OVER THE WALL,There does the tremulous harebell swing;
532,OVER THE WALL,And many a scarlet berry shines
533,OVER THE WALL,Deep in the green of the tangled vines.
534,OVER THE WALL,
535,OVER THE WALL,"Over the wall at dawn of day,"
536,OVER THE WALL,"Over the wall at noon,"
537,OVER THE WALL,Over the wall when the shadows say
538,OVER THE WALL,"That night is coming soon,"
539,OVER THE WALL,A little maiden with laughing eyes
540,OVER THE WALL,"Climbs in her eager haste, and hies"
541,OVER THE WALL,"Down to the spot where the wild vines creep,"
542,OVER THE WALL,And violets bloom by the rocky steep.
543,OVER THE WALL,
544,OVER THE WALL,All wild things love her. The murmuring bee
545,OVER THE WALL,"Scarce stirs when she draws near,"
546,OVER THE WALL,And sings the bird in the hemlock-tree
547,OVER THE WALL,Its sweetest for her ear.
548,OVER THE WALL,"The harebells nod as she passes by,"
549,OVER THE WALL,"The violet lifts its tender eye,"
550,OVER THE WALL,"The low ferns bend her steps to greet,"
551,OVER THE WALL,And the mosses creep to her dancing feet.
552,OVER THE WALL,
553,OVER THE WALL,Up in her pathway seems to spring
554,OVER THE WALL,"All that is sweet or rare,—"
555,OVER THE WALL,"Chrysalis quaint, or the moth’s bright wing,"
556,OVER THE WALL,Or flower-buds strangely fair.
557,OVER THE WALL,She watches the tiniest bird’s-nest hid
558,OVER THE WALL,The thickly clustering leaves amid;
559,OVER THE WALL,And the small brown tree-toad on her arm
560,OVER THE WALL,"Quietly hops, and fears no harm."
561,OVER THE WALL,
562,OVER THE WALL,"Ah, child of the laughing eyes, and heart"
563,OVER THE WALL,Attuned to Nature’s voice!
564,OVER THE WALL,Thou hast found a bliss that will ne’er depart
565,OVER THE WALL,"While earth can say, “Rejoice!”"
566,OVER THE WALL,"The years must come, and the years must go;"
567,OVER THE WALL,"But the flowers will bloom, and the breezes blow,"
568,OVER THE WALL,"And bird and butterfly, moth and bee,"
569,OVER THE WALL,Bring on their swift wings joy to thee!

578,OUTGROWN,
579,OUTGROWN,Can you bear me to talk with you frankly? There is much that my

611,OUTGROWN,to grow.
612,OUTGROWN,
613,OUTGROWN,"Her eyes they are sweeter and calmer, but their vision is clearer"

636,OUTGROWN,

659,A SONG FOR TWO,Not that its days were sweet with sun and showers;

781,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,What was it? I paused and listened;
782,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,"The roses were all in bloom,"

784,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,The violet’s rich perfume.
785,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,"So it could not be Kriss Kringle,"
786,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,"For he only comes, you know,"

795,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,"Blackened with soot and smoke,"
796,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,With a whir of fluttering pinions
797,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,A startled birdling broke.
798,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,
799,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,Dashing against the window;
800,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,Lighting a moment where

803,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,Swinging upon the curtains;
804,THE CHIMNEY SWALLOW,Perched on the ivy-vine;

978,HEREAFTER,Shrouded in mystery profound.
979,HEREAFTER,

989,HEREAFTER,
990,HEREAFTER,Thou blest Hereafter! Mortal tongue
991,HEREAFTER,"Hath striven in vain thy speech to learn,"
992,HEREAFTER,"And Fancy wanders, lost among"
993,HEREAFTER,The flowery paths for which we yearn.
994,HEREAFTER,
995,HEREAFTER,"But well we know that fair and bright,"
996,HEREAFTER,"Far beyond human ken or dream,"
997,HEREAFTER,"Too glorious for our feeble sight,"
998,HEREAFTER,Thy skies of cloudless azure beam.

1006,HEREAFTER,"Faint gleamings from thy far-off shore,"
1007,HEREAFTER,While still with eager eyes we watch

1009,HEREAFTER,
1010,HEREAFTER,"The loved, the deeply loved, are there!"
1011,HEREAFTER,"The brave, the fair, the good, the wise,"

1042,WITHOUT AND WITHIN,

1092,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Forsaken, poor and lonely, I who wore"
1093,VASHTI’S SCROLL,The crown of Persia with such stately grace!
1094,VASHTI’S SCROLL,But yesterday a royal wife; but now
1095,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"From my estate cast down, and fallen so low"
1096,VASHTI’S SCROLL,That beggars scoff at me! Men toss my name
1097,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Backward and forward on their mocking tongues.
1098,VASHTI’S SCROLL,In all the king’s broad realm there is not one
1099,VASHTI’S SCROLL,To do poor Vashti homage. Even the dog
1100,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"My hand had fondled, in the palace walls"
1101,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Fawns on my rival. When I left the court,"
1102,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Weeping and sore distressed, he followed me,"
1103,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Licking my fingers, leaping in my face,"
1104,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And frisking round me till I reached the gates.
1105,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Then with long pauses, as of one perplexed,"
1106,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"And frequent lookings backward, and low whines"
1107,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Of puzzled wonder—that had made me smile
1108,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"If I had been less lorn—with drooping ears,"
1109,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Dropt eyes, and downcast forehead he went back,"
1110,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Leaving me desolate. So went they all
1111,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Who, when Ahasuerus on my brow"
1112,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Set his own royal crown and called me queen,"
1113,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Made the air ring with plaudits! Loud they cried,"
1114,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"“Long live Queen Vashti, Persia’s fairest Rose,"
1115,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Mother of Princes, and the nation’s Hope!”"
1116,VASHTI’S SCROLL,The rose is withered now; the queen’s no more.
1117,VASHTI’S SCROLL,To these lorn breasts no princely boy shall cling
1118,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Or now, or ever. Yet on this poor scroll"
1119,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"I will rehearse the story of my woes,"
1120,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And bid them lay it in the grave with me
1121,VASHTI’S SCROLL,When I depart to join the unnumbered dead.
1122,VASHTI’S SCROLL,
1123,VASHTI’S SCROLL,*       *       *       *       *
1124,VASHTI’S SCROLL,
1125,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Oh, thou unknown, unborn, who through the gloom"
1126,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And mists of ages in my vaulted tomb
1127,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Shalt find this parchment, and with reverent care"
1128,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Shalt bear it outward to the sun and air:
1129,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Oh, thou whose patient fingers shall unroll"
1130,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"With slow, persuasive touch this little scroll:"
1131,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Oh, loving, tender eyes that, like twin stars,"
1132,VASHTI’S SCROLL,I seem to see through yonder cloudy bars:
1133,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Read Vashti’s story, and I pray ye tell"
1134,VASHTI’S SCROLL,The whole wide world if she did ill or well!
1135,VASHTI’S SCROLL,
1136,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Ahasuerus reigned. On Persia’s throne,"
1137,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Lord of a mighty realm, he sat alone,"
1138,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And stretched his sceptre from the farthest slope
1139,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Of India’s hills, to where the Ethiop"
1140,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Dwelt in barbaric splendor. Kinglier king
1141,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Never did poet praise or minstrel sing!
1142,VASHTI’S SCROLL,He had no peers. Among his lords he shone
1143,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"As shines a planet, single and alone;"
1144,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"And I, alas! I loved him, and we two"
1145,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Such bliss as peasant lovers joy in, knew!"
1146,VASHTI’S SCROLL,No lowly home in all our wide domain
1147,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Held more of peace than ours, or less of pain."
1148,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"But one dark day—O, woeful day of days,"
1149,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Whose hours I number now in sad amaze,"
1150,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Thou hadst no prophet of the ills to be,"
1151,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Nor sign nor omen came to succor me!—
1152,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"That day Ahasuerus smiled and said,"
1153,VASHTI’S SCROLL,“Since first I wore this crown upon my head
1154,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Thrice have the emerald clusters of the vine
1155,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Changed to translucent globes of ruby wine;
1156,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And thrice the peaches on the loaded walls
1157,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Have slowly rounded into wondrous balls
1158,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Of gold and crimson. I will make a feast.
1159,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Princes and lords, the greatest and the least,"
1160,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"All Persia and all Media, shall see"
1161,VASHTI’S SCROLL,The pomp and splendor that encompass me.
1162,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The riches of my kingdom shall be shown,"
1163,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And all my glorious majesty made known
1164,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Where’er the shadow of my sceptred hand
1165,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Sways a great people with its mute command!”
1166,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Then came from far and near a hurrying throng
1167,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Of skilled and cunning workmen. All day long
1168,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"And far into the startled night, they wrought"
1169,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Most quaint and beautiful devices—still
1170,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Responsive to their master’s eager will,"
1171,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And giving form to his creative thought—
1172,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Till Shushan grew a marvel!
1173,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Never yet
1174,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Yon rolling sun on fairer scene has set:
1175,VASHTI’S SCROLL,The palace windows were ablaze with light;
1176,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"And Persia’s lords were there, most richly dight"
1177,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"In broidered silks, or costliest cloth of gold,"
1178,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"That kept the sunshine in each lustrous fold,"
1179,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Or softly flowing tissues, pure and white"
1180,VASHTI’S SCROLL,As fleecy clouds at noonday. Clear and bright
1181,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Shone the pure gold of Ophir, and the gleam"
1182,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Of burning gems, that mocked the pallid beam"
1183,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Of the dim, wondering stars, made radiance there,"
1184,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Splendor undreamed of, and beyond compare!"
1185,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Up from the gardens floated the perfume
1186,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Of rose and myrtle, in their perfect bloom;"
1187,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The red pomegranate cleft its heart in twain,"
1188,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Pouring its life blood in a crimson rain;
1189,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The slight acacia waved its yellow plumes,"
1190,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And afar off amid the starlit glooms
1191,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Were sweet recesses, where the orange bowers"
1192,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Dropt their pure blossoms down in snowy showers,"
1193,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And night reigned undisturbed.
1194,VASHTI’S SCROLL,From cups of gold
1195,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Diverse one from another, meet to hold"
1196,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The king’s most costly wines, or to be raised"
1197,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"To princely lips, the gay guests drank, and praised"
1198,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Their rich abundance. Rapturous music swept
1199,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Through the vast arches and the secret kept
1200,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Of its own joy; while in slow, rhythmic time"
1201,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"To clash of cymbal and the lute’s clear chime,"
1202,VASHTI’S SCROLL,The dancing-girls stole through the fragrant night
1203,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"With wreathéd arms, flushed cheeks and eyes alight,"
1204,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And softly rounded forms that rose and fell
1205,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"To the voluptuous music’s dreamy swell,"
1206,VASHTI’S SCROLL,As if the air were pulsing waves that bore
1207,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Them up and onward to some longed-for shore!
1208,VASHTI’S SCROLL,
1209,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Wild waxed the revel. On an ivory throne
1210,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Inlaid with ebony and gems that shone
1211,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"With a surpassing lustre, sat my lord,"
1212,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The King Ahasuerus. His great sword,"
1213,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Blazing with diamonds on hilt and blade,—"
1214,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The mighty sword that made his foes afraid,—"
1215,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"And the proud sceptre he was wont to grasp,"
1216,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"With all the monarch in his kingly clasp,"
1217,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Against the crouching lions (guard that kept
1218,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"On either side the throne and never slept),"
1219,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Leaned carelessly. And flowing downward o’er
1220,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The ivory steps even to the marble floor,"
1221,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Swept the rich royal robes in many a fold
1222,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Of Tyrian purple flecked with yellow gold.
1223,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The jewelled crown his young head scorned to wear,"
1224,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"More fitly crowned by its own clustering hair,"
1225,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Lay on a pearl-wrought cushion by his side,"
1226,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Mute symbol of great Persia’s power and pride;
1227,VASHTI’S SCROLL,While on his brow some courtier’s hand had placed
1228,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The fairest chaplet monarch ever graced,"
1229,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"A wreath of dewy roses, fresh and sweet,"
1230,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Just brought from out the garden’s cool retreat.
1231,VASHTI’S SCROLL,
1232,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Louder and louder grew the sounds of mirth;
1233,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Faster and faster flowed the red wine forth;
1234,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"In high, exulting strains the minstrels sang"
1235,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The monarch’s glory, till the great roof rang;"
1236,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"And flushed at length with pride and song and wine,"
1237,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The king rose up and said, “O nobles mine!"
1238,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Princes of Persia, Media’s hope and pride,"
1239,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Stars of my kingdom, will ye aught beside?"
1240,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Speak! and I swear your sovereign’s will shall be
1241,VASHTI’S SCROLL,On this fair night to please and honor ye!”
1242,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Then rose a shout from out the glittering throng
1243,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Drowning the voice of merriment and song,"
1244,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Humming and murmuring like a hive of bees—
1245,VASHTI’S SCROLL,What would they more each charmèd sense to please?
1246,VASHTI’S SCROLL,
1247,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Out spoke at last a tongue that should have been
1248,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Palsied in foul dishonor there and then.
1249,VASHTI’S SCROLL,“O great Ahasuerus! ne’er before
1250,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Reigned such a king so blest a people o’er!
1251,VASHTI’S SCROLL,What shall we ask? What great and wondrous boon
1252,VASHTI’S SCROLL,To crown the hours that fly away too soon?
1253,VASHTI’S SCROLL,There is but one. ’Tis said that mortal eyes
1254,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Never yet gazed, in rapturous surprise,"
1255,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Upon a face like that of her who wears
1256,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Thy signet-ring, and all thy glory shares,—"
1257,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Thy fair Queen Vashti, she who yet shall be"
1258,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Mother of him who reigneth after thee!
1259,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Show us that face, O king! For nought beside"
1260,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Can make our cup of joy o’erflow with pride.”
1261,VASHTI’S SCROLL,
1262,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"A murmur ran throughout the startled crowd,"
1263,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Swelling at last to plaudits long and loud.
1264,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Maddened with wine, they knew not what they said."
1265,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Ahasuerus bent his haughty head,"
1266,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And for an instant o’er his face there swept
1267,VASHTI’S SCROLL,A look his courtiers in their memory kept
1268,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"For many a day—a look of doubt and pain,"
1269,VASHTI’S SCROLL,They scarcely caught ere it had passed again.
1270,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"“My word is pledged,” he said. Then to the seven"
1271,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Lord chamberlains to whom the keys were given:
1272,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"“Haste ye, and to this noble presence bring"
1273,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Vashti, the Queen, with royal crown and ring;"
1274,VASHTI’S SCROLL,That all my lords may see the matchless charms
1275,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Kind Heaven has sent to bless my kingly arms.”
1276,VASHTI’S SCROLL,
1277,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"They did their errand, those old, gray-haired men,"
1278,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Who should have braved the lion in his den,"
1279,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Or ere they bore such message to their queen,"
1280,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Or took such words their aged lips between.
1281,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"What! I, the daughter of a royal race,"
1282,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Step down, unblushing, from my lofty place,"
1283,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"And, like a common dancing-girl, who wears"
1284,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Her beauty unconcealed, and, shameless, bares"
1285,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Her brow to every gazer, boldly go"
1286,VASHTI’S SCROLL,To those wild revellers my face to show?
1287,VASHTI’S SCROLL,I—who had kept my beauty pure and bright
1288,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Only because ’twas precious in his sight,"
1289,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Guarding it ever as a holy thing,"
1290,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Sacred to him, my lover, lord, and king,—"
1291,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Could I unveil it to the curious eyes
1292,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Of the mad rabble that with drunken cries
1293,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Were shouting “Vashti! Vashti?”—Sooner far,"
1294,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Beyond the rays of sun, or moon, or star,"
1295,VASHTI’S SCROLL,I would have buried it in endless night!
1296,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Pale and dismayed, in wonder and affright,"
1297,VASHTI’S SCROLL,My maidens hung around me as I told
1298,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Those seven lord chamberlains, so gray and old,"
1299,VASHTI’S SCROLL,To bear this answer back: “It may not be.
1300,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"My lord, my king, I cannot come to thee."
1301,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"It is not meet that Persia’s queen, like one"
1302,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Who treads the market-place from sun to sun,"
1303,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Should bare her beauty to the hungry crowd,"
1304,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Who name her name in accents hoarse and loud.”
1305,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"With stern, cold looks they left me. Ah! I knew"
1306,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"If my dear lord to his best self were true,"
1307,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"That he would hold me guiltless, and would say,"
1308,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"“I thank thee, love, that thou didst not obey!”"
1309,VASHTI’S SCROLL,But the red wine was ruling o’er his brain;
1310,VASHTI’S SCROLL,The cruel wine that recked not of my pain.
1311,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Up from the angry throng a clamor rose;
1312,VASHTI’S SCROLL,The flattering sycophants were now my foes;

1314,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Hiding the jealous joy they dared not own,"
1315,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"With slow, wise words, and many a virtuous frown,"
1316,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Said, “Be the queen from her estate cast down!"
1317,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Let her not see the king’s face evermore,"
1318,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Nor come within his presence as of yore;
1319,VASHTI’S SCROLL,So disobedient wives through all the land
1320,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Shall read the lesson, heed and understand.”"
1321,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Up spoke another, eager to be heard,"
1322,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"In royal councils fain to have a word,—"
1323,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"“Let this commandment of the king be writ,"
1324,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"In the law of the Medes and Persians, as is fit,—"
1325,VASHTI’S SCROLL,The perfect law that man may alter not
1326,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Nor of its bitter end abate one jot.”
1327,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Alas! the king was wroth. Before his face
1328,VASHTI’S SCROLL,I could not go to plead my piteous case;
1329,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"But, pitiless, with scarce dissembled sneers,"
1330,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"And poisoned words that rankled in his ears,"
1331,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"My wily foes, afraid to let him pause,"
1332,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Brought the great book that held the Persian laws,"
1333,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"And ere the rising of the morrow’s sun,"
1334,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"My bitter doom was sealed, the deed was done!"
1335,VASHTI’S SCROLL,
1336,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Scarce had two moons passed when one dreary night
1337,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"I sat within my bower in woeful plight,"
1338,VASHTI’S SCROLL,When suddenly upon my presence stole
1339,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"A muffled form, whose shadow stirred my soul"
1340,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"I knew not wherefore. Ere my tongue could speak,"
1341,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Or with a breath the brooding silence break,"
1342,VASHTI’S SCROLL,A low voice murmured “Vashti!”
1343,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Pale and still,"
1344,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Hushing my heart’s cry with an iron will,"
1345,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"“What would the king?” I asked. No answer came,"
1346,VASHTI’S SCROLL,But to his sad eyes leaped a sudden flame;
1347,VASHTI’S SCROLL,With clasping arms he raised me to his breast
1348,VASHTI’S SCROLL,And on my brow and lips such kisses pressed
1349,VASHTI’S SCROLL,As one might give the dead. I may not tell
1350,VASHTI’S SCROLL,All the wild words that I remember well.
1351,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Oh! was it joy or was it pain to know
1352,VASHTI’S SCROLL,That not alone I wept my weary woe?
1353,VASHTI’S SCROLL,Alas! I know not. But I know to-day—
1354,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"If this be sin, forgive me, Heaven, I pray!—"
1355,VASHTI’S SCROLL,That though his eyes have never looked on mine
1356,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Since that dark night when stars refused to shine,"
1357,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"And fair Queen Esther sits, a beauteous bride,"
1358,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"In stately Shushan at the monarch’s side,"
1359,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"The king remembers Vashti, even yet"
1360,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Breathing her name sometimes with vain regret,"
1361,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"Or murmuring, haply, in a whisper low,—"
1362,VASHTI’S SCROLL,"“O pure, proud heart that loved me long ago!”"

1514,WHAT I LOST,When the mists upon the mountains
1515,WHAT I LOST,Flushed with purple splendor lay:
1516,WHAT I LOST,When the sunlight kissed the hilltops
1517,WHAT I LOST,"And the vales were hushed and dim,"
1518,WHAT I LOST,And from out the forest arches
1519,WHAT I LOST,Rose a holy vesper hymn—
1520,WHAT I LOST,"I lost something. Have you seen it,"
1521,WHAT I LOST,"Children, ye who passed that way?"
1522,WHAT I LOST,Did you chance to find the treasure
1523,WHAT I LOST,That I lost that summer day?
1524,WHAT I LOST,
1525,WHAT I LOST,"It was neither gold nor silver,"
1526,WHAT I LOST,Orient pearl nor jewel rare;
1527,WHAT I LOST,"Neither amethyst nor ruby,"
1528,WHAT I LOST,Nor an opal gleaming fair;
1529,WHAT I LOST,"’Twas no curious, quaint mosaic"
1530,WHAT I LOST,"Wrought by cunning master-hands,"
1531,WHAT I LOST,"Nor a cameo where Hebe,"
1532,WHAT I LOST,"Crowned with deathless beauty, stands."
1533,WHAT I LOST,Yet have I lost something precious;
1534,WHAT I LOST,"Children, ye who passed that way—"

1540,WHAT I LOST,Or a tiny flask of crystal
1541,WHAT I LOST,Meet the rose’s breath to bear;
1542,WHAT I LOST,"Or a bird of wondrous plumage,"
1543,WHAT I LOST,"With a voice of sweetest tone,"
1544,WHAT I LOST,"That, escaping from my bosom,"
1545,WHAT I LOST,To the greenwood deep has flown.
1546,WHAT I LOST,"Ah! not these, I answer vainly;"
1547,WHAT I LOST,"Children, ye who passed that way,"
1548,WHAT I LOST,Ye can never find the treasure
1549,WHAT I LOST,That I lost that summer day!

2231,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,"The wounded veteran spoke,—"
2232,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,
2233,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,“The blue-eyed boy of Malvern Hill!
2234,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,"A hero every inch was he,"

2236,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,"You hold, sir, on your knee."
2237,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,
2238,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,Some mother’s darling! On that field
2239,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,"He seemed so strangely out of place,"

2242,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,
2243,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,But not a bearded warrior there
2244,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,Watched with a more undaunted eye

2246,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,As the fierce storm rose high.
2247,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,
2248,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,That morn—ah! what a morn was that!—

2291,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,Right gallantly and well.
2292,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,
2293,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,A moment’s awful waiting! Then
2294,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,"There came a sullen, angry roar,—"
2295,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,O God! An empty void remained
2296,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,Where Charley stood before.
2297,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,
2298,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,What did we then? With souls on fire
2299,CHARLEY OF MALVERN HILL,"We swept upon the advancing foe,"

2380,THE LAST OF SIX,
2381,THE LAST OF SIX,To-day this letter came to me. At first I could not brook
2382,THE LAST OF SIX,"Upon the unfamiliar lines by strangers penned, to look;"
2383,THE LAST OF SIX,The dread of evil tidings shook my soul with wild alarm—
2384,THE LAST OF SIX,"But Harry’s in the hospital, and has only lost an arm."
2385,THE LAST OF SIX,
2386,THE LAST OF SIX,He is the last—the last of six brave boys as e’er were seen!
2387,THE LAST OF SIX,"How short, to memory’s vision, seem the years that lie between"
2388,THE LAST OF SIX,"This hour and those most blessed ones, when round this hearth’s"
2389,THE LAST OF SIX,bright blaze
2390,THE LAST OF SIX,They charmed their mother’s heart and eye with all their pretty

2392,THE LAST OF SIX,
2393,THE LAST OF SIX,"My William was the eldest son, and he was first to go."
2394,THE LAST OF SIX,"It did not at all surprise me, for I knew it would be so,"
2395,THE LAST OF SIX,"From that fearful April Sunday when the news from Sumter came,"
2396,THE LAST OF SIX,"And his lips grew white as ashes, while his eyes were all aflame."
2397,THE LAST OF SIX,
2398,THE LAST OF SIX,"He sprang to join the three months’ men. I could not say him nay,"
2399,THE LAST OF SIX,Though my heart stood still within me when I saw him march away;
2400,THE LAST OF SIX,"At the corner of the street he smiled, and waved the flag he bore;"
2401,THE LAST OF SIX,I never saw him smile again—he was slain at Baltimore.
2402,THE LAST OF SIX,
2403,THE LAST OF SIX,"They sent his body back to me, and as we stood around"
2404,THE LAST OF SIX,"His grave, beside his father’s, in yonder burial-ground,"
2405,THE LAST OF SIX,"John laid his hand upon my arm and whispered, “Mother dear,"
2406,THE LAST OF SIX,I have Willy’s work and mine to do. I cannot loiter here.”
2407,THE LAST OF SIX,
2408,THE LAST OF SIX,"I turned and looked at Paul, for he and John were twins, you know,"
2409,THE LAST OF SIX,"Born on a happy Christmas, four-and-twenty years ago;"
2410,THE LAST OF SIX,"I looked upon them both, while my tears fell down like rain,"
2411,THE LAST OF SIX,"For I knew what one had spoken, had been spoken by the twain."
2412,THE LAST OF SIX,
2413,THE LAST OF SIX,"In a month or more they left me—the merry, handsome boys,"
2414,THE LAST OF SIX,"Who had kept the old house ringing with their laughter, fun, and"
2415,THE LAST OF SIX,noise.
2416,THE LAST OF SIX,Then James came home to mind the farm; my younger sons were still
2417,THE LAST OF SIX,"Mere children, at their lessons in the school-house on the hill."
2418,THE LAST OF SIX,
2419,THE LAST OF SIX,O days of weary waiting! O days of doubt and dread!
2420,THE LAST OF SIX,"I feared to read the papers, or to see the lists of dead;"
2421,THE LAST OF SIX,"But when full many a battle-storm had left them both unharmed,"
2422,THE LAST OF SIX,I taught my foolish heart to think the double lives were charmed.
2423,THE LAST OF SIX,
2424,THE LAST OF SIX,Their colonel since has told me that no braver boys than they
2425,THE LAST OF SIX,"Ever rallied round the colors, in the thickest of the fray;"
2426,THE LAST OF SIX,Upon the wall behind you their swords are hanging still—
2427,THE LAST OF SIX,"For John was killed at Fair Oaks, and Paul at Malvern Hill."
2428,THE LAST OF SIX,
2429,THE LAST OF SIX,"Then came the dark days, darker than any known before;"
2430,THE LAST OF SIX,There was another call for men—“three hundred thousand more;”
2431,THE LAST OF SIX,I saw the cloud on Jamie’s brow grow deeper day by day;
2432,THE LAST OF SIX,"I shrank before the impending blow, and scarce had strength to pray."
2433,THE LAST OF SIX,
2434,THE LAST OF SIX,"And yet at last I bade him go, while on my cheek and brow"
2435,THE LAST OF SIX,"His loving tears and kisses fell; I feel them even now,"
2436,THE LAST OF SIX,"Though the eyes that shed the tears, and the lips so warm on mine"
2437,THE LAST OF SIX,"Are hidden under southern sands, beneath a blasted pine!"
2438,THE LAST OF SIX,
2439,THE LAST OF SIX,"He did not die in battle-smoke, but for a weary year"
2440,THE LAST OF SIX,"He languished in close prison walls, a prey to hope and fear;"
2441,THE LAST OF SIX,"I dare not trust myself to think of the fruitless pangs he bore,"
2442,THE LAST OF SIX,My brain grows wild when in my dreams I count his sufferings o’er.
2443,THE LAST OF SIX,
2444,THE LAST OF SIX,Only two left! I thought the worst was surely over then;
2445,THE LAST OF SIX,But lo! at once my school-boy sons sprang up before me—men!
2446,THE LAST OF SIX,They heard their brothers’ martyr blood call from the hallowed
2447,THE LAST OF SIX,ground;
2448,THE LAST OF SIX,"A loud, imperious summons that all other voices drowned."
2449,THE LAST OF SIX,
2450,THE LAST OF SIX,I did not say a single word. My very heart seemed dead.
2451,THE LAST OF SIX,"What could I do but take the cup, and bow my weary head"
2452,THE LAST OF SIX,To drink the bitter draught again? I dared not hold them back;
2453,THE LAST OF SIX,I would as soon have tried to check the whirlwind on its track.
2454,THE LAST OF SIX,
2455,THE LAST OF SIX,You know the rest. At Cedar Creek my Frederick bravely fell;
2456,THE LAST OF SIX,They say his young arm did its work right nobly and right well;
2457,THE LAST OF SIX,His comrades breathe the hero’s name with mingled love and pride;
2458,THE LAST OF SIX,"I miss the gentle blue-eyed boy, who frolicked at my side."
2459,THE LAST OF SIX,
2460,THE LAST OF SIX,"For me, I ne’er shall weep again. I think my heart is dead;"
2461,THE LAST OF SIX,"I, who could weep for lighter griefs, have now no tears to shed."
2462,THE LAST OF SIX,"But read this letter, neighbor. There is nothing to alarm,"
2463,THE LAST OF SIX,"For Harry’s in the hospital, and has only lost an arm!"
2464,THE LAST OF SIX,
2465,THE LAST OF SIX,
2466,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL
2467,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2468,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,All day long the storm of battle through the startled valley swept;
2469,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,All night long the stars in heaven o’er the slain sad vigils kept.
2470,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2471,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Oh, the ghastly, upturned faces, gleaming whitely through the night!"
2472,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Oh, the heaps of mangled corses in that dim, sepulchral light!"
2473,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2474,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"One by one the pale stars faded, and at length the morning broke;"
2475,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,But not one of all the sleepers on that field of death awoke.
2476,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2477,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Slowly passed the golden hours of the long bright summer day,"
2478,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And upon the field of carnage still the dead unburied lay;
2479,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2480,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Lay there stark and cold, but pleading with a dumb, unceasing"
2481,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"prayer,"
2482,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,For a little dust to hide them from the staring sun and air.
2483,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2484,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Once again the night dropped round them—night so holy and so calm
2485,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"That the moonbeams hushed the spirit, like the sound of prayer or"
2486,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,psalm.
2487,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2488,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"On a couch of trampled grasses, just apart from all the rest,"
2489,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Lay a fair young boy, with small hands meekly folded on his breast."
2490,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2491,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Death had touched him very gently, and he lay as if in sleep;"
2492,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Even his mother scarce had shuddered at that slumber, calm and deep."
2493,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2494,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"For a smile of wondrous sweetness lent a radiance to the face,"
2495,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And the hand of cunning sculptor could have added naught of grace
2496,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2497,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"To the marble limbs so perfect in their passionless repose,"
2498,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Robbed of all save matchless purity by hard, unpitying foes."
2499,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2500,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And the broken drum beside him all his life’s short story told;
2501,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,How he did his duty bravely till the death-tide o’er him rolled.
2502,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2503,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Midnight came with ebon garments and a diadem of stars,"
2504,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,While right upward in the zenith hung the fiery planet Mars.
2505,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2506,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Hark! a sound of stealthy footsteps and of voices whispering low—
2507,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Was it nothing but the young leaves, or the brooklet’s murmuring"
2508,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,flow?
2509,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2510,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Clinging closely to each other, striving never to look round"
2511,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"As they passed with silent shudder the pale corses on the ground,"
2512,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2513,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Came two little maidens—sisters—with a light and hasty tread,"
2514,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"And a look upon their faces, half of sorrow, half of dread."
2515,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2516,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"And they did not pause nor falter till, with throbbing hearts, they"
2517,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,stood
2518,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Where the Drummer-Boy was lying in that partial solitude.
2519,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2520,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,They had brought some simple garments from their wardrobe’s scanty
2521,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"store,"
2522,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And two heavy iron shovels in their slender hands they bore.
2523,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2524,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Then they quickly knelt beside him, crushing back the pitying tears,"
2525,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"For they had no time for weeping, nor for any girlish fears."
2526,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2527,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"And they robed the icy body, while no glow of maiden shame"
2528,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Changed the pallor of their foreheads to a flush of lambent flame.
2529,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2530,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,For their saintly hearts yearned o’er it in that hour of sorest
2531,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"need,"
2532,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And they felt that Death was holy and it sanctified the deed.
2533,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2534,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"But they smiled and kissed each other when their new, strange task"
2535,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"was o’er,"
2536,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And the form that lay before them its unwonted garments wore.
2537,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2538,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Then with slow and weary labor a small grave they hollowed out,"
2539,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And they lined it with the withered grass and leaves that lay about.
2540,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2541,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"But the day was slowly breaking ere their holy work was done,"
2542,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And in crimson pomp the morning again heralded the sun.
2543,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2544,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And then those little maidens—they were children of our foes—
2545,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Laid the body of our Drummer-Boy to undisturbed repose.
2546,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2547,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2548,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,1865
2549,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2550,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,O darkest Year! O brightest Year!
2551,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"O changeful Year of joy and woe,"
2552,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"To-day we stand beside thy bier,"
2553,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Still loth to let thee go!
2554,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2555,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"We look upon thy brow, and say,"
2556,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"“How old he is,—how old and worn!”"
2557,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Has but a twelvemonth passed away
2558,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Since thou wert newly born?
2559,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2560,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,So long it seems since on the air
2561,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,The joy-bells rang to hail thy birth—
2562,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"And pale lips strove to call thee fair,"
2563,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And sing the songs of mirth!
2564,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2565,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,For dark the heavens that o’er thee hung;
2566,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,By stormy winds thy couch was rocked;
2567,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Thy cradle-hymn the Furies sung,"
2568,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,While sneering Demons mocked!
2569,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2570,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,We held our very breath for dread;
2571,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Shadowed by clouds, that, like a pall,"
2572,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Darkened the blue sky overhead,"
2573,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And night hung over all.
2574,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2575,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"But thou wert better than our fears,"
2576,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And bade our land’s long anguish cease;
2577,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"And gave us, O thou Year of years,"
2578,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,The costly pearl of Peace!
2579,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2580,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,So dearly bought! By precious blood
2581,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Of patriot heroes—sire and son—
2582,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"And that of him, the pure and good,"
2583,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Our wearied, martyred One;"
2584,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2585,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Who bore for us the heavy load—
2586,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,The cross our hands upon him laid;
2587,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Who trod for us the toilsome road
2588,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Meekly, yet undismayed!"
2589,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2590,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And for that gift—although thy graves
2591,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Lie thick beneath December’s snow,"
2592,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Though every hamlet mourns its braves,"
2593,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,And bears its weight of woe—
2594,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2595,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"We bless thee! Yet, O bounteous year,"
2596,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"For more than Peace we thank thee now,"
2597,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"As bending o’er thine honored bier,"
2598,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,We crown thy pallid brow!
2599,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2600,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"We bless thee, though we scarcely dare"
2601,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Give to our new-born joy a tongue;
2602,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"O mighty Year, upon the air"
2603,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Thy voice triumphant rung,"
2604,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2605,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Even in death! and at the sound,"
2606,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,From myriad limbs the fetters fell
2607,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Into the dim and vast profound,"
2608,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,While tolled thy passing bell!
2609,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,
2610,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"Farewell, farewell, thou storied Year!"
2611,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,Thou wondrous Year of joy and gloom!
2612,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,"With grateful hearts we crown thee, ere"
2613,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,We lay thee in thy tomb!
2614,THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL,

2616,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL
2617,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2618,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Remove them not! Above our fallen braves
2619,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Nature not yet her perfect work hath wrought;
2620,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"Scarce has the turf grown green upon their graves,"
2621,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,The martyr graves for whose embrace they fought.
2622,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2623,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,The wounds of our long conflict are not healed;
2624,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Our land’s fair face is seamed with many a scar;
2625,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"And woeful sights, on many a battle-field,"
2626,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Show ghastly grim beneath the evening star.
2627,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2628,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"Still does the sad Earth tremble with affright,"
2629,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Lest she the tread of armèd hosts should feel
2630,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Once more upon her bosom. Still the Night
2631,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"Hears, in wild dreams, the cannon’s thundering peal."
2632,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2633,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Still do the black-robed mothers come and go;
2634,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Still do lone wives by dreary hearth-stones weep;
2635,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"Still does a Nation, in her pride and woe,"
2636,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,For her dead sons a mournful vigil keep.
2637,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2638,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"Ah, then, awhile delay! Remove ye not"
2639,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,These drooping banners from their place on high;
2640,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"They make of each proud hall a hallowed spot,"
2641,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Where Truth must dwell and Freedom cannot die.
2642,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2643,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"Now slowly waving in this tranquil air,"
2644,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,What wondrous eloquence is in their speech!
2645,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"No prophet “silver tongued,” no poet rare,"
2646,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Even in dreams may hope such heights to reach.
2647,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2648,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,They tell of Life that calmly looked on Death—
2649,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Of peerless valor and of trust sublime—
2650,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"Of costly sacrifice, of holiest faith,"
2651,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Of lofty hopes that ended not with Time.
2652,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2653,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Oh! each worn fold is hallowed! set apart
2654,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,To minister unto us in our needs—
2655,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"To bear henceforth to many a fainting heart,"
2656,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,The cordial wine of noble thoughts and deeds.
2657,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2658,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"Then leave them yet awhile where, day by day,"
2659,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"The lessons that they teach, your souls may learn;"
2660,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,"So shall ye work for righteousness alway,"
2661,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,And for its faithful service ever yearn.
2662,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2663,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Now may God bless our land for evermore!
2664,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,And from all strife and turmoil grant surcease;
2665,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,While from the mountains to the farthest shore
2666,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,Accordant voices softly whisper—Peace!
2667,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2668,OUR FLAGS AT THE CAPITOL,
2669,MY MOCKING-BIRD,MY MOCKING-BIRD
2670,MY MOCKING-BIRD,
2671,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Mocking-bird! mocking-bird! swinging high
2672,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Aloft in your gilded cage,"
2673,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"The clouds are hurrying over the sky,"
2674,MY MOCKING-BIRD,The wild winds fiercely rage.
2675,MY MOCKING-BIRD,But soft and warm is the air you breathe
2676,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Up there with the tremulous ivy wreath,"
2677,MY MOCKING-BIRD,And never an icy blast can chill
2678,MY MOCKING-BIRD,The perfumed silence sweet and still.
2679,MY MOCKING-BIRD,
2680,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Mocking-bird! mocking-bird! from your throat
2681,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Breaks forth no flood of song,"
2682,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Nor even one perfect golden note,"
2683,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Triumphant, glad, and strong!"
2684,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"But now and then a pitiful wail,"
2685,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Like the plaintive sigh of the dying gale,"
2686,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Comes from that arching breast of thine
2687,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Swinging up there with the ivy-vine.
2688,MY MOCKING-BIRD,
2689,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Mocking-bird! mocking-bird! well I know
2690,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Your heart is far away,"
2691,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Where the golden stars of the jasmine glow,"
2692,MY MOCKING-BIRD,And the roses bloom alway!
2693,MY MOCKING-BIRD,For your cradle-nest was softly made
2694,MY MOCKING-BIRD,In the depth of a blossoming myrtle’s shade;
2695,MY MOCKING-BIRD,And you heard the chant of the southern seas
2696,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Borne inland by the favoring breeze.
2697,MY MOCKING-BIRD,
2698,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"But, ah, my beautiful mocking-bird!"
2699,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Should I bear you back again,"
2700,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Never would song of yours be heard
2701,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Echoing through the glen.
2702,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"For once, ah! once at the dawn of day,"
2703,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"You waked to the roar of the deadly fray,"
2704,MY MOCKING-BIRD,When the terrible clash of armèd foes
2705,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Startled the vale from its dim repose.
2706,MY MOCKING-BIRD,
2707,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"At first you sat on a swaying bough,"
2708,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Mocking the bugle’s blare,"
2709,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Fearless and free in the fervid glow
2710,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Of the heated, sulphurous air."
2711,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Your voice rang out like a trumpet’s note,"
2712,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"With a martial ring in its upward float,"
2713,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"And stern men smiled, for you seemed to be"
2714,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Cheering them on to victory!
2715,MY MOCKING-BIRD,
2716,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"But at length, as the awful day wore on,"
2717,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"You flew to a tree-top high,"
2718,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"And sat like a spectre grim and wan,"
2719,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Outlined against the sky;
2720,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Sat silently watching the fiery fray
2721,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Till, heaps upon heaps, the Blue and Gray"
2722,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Lay together, a silent band,"
2723,MY MOCKING-BIRD,Whose souls had passed to the shadowy land.
2724,MY MOCKING-BIRD,
2725,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Ah, my mocking-bird! swinging there"
2726,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Under the ivy-vine,"
2727,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"You still remember the bugle’s blare,"
2728,MY MOCKING-BIRD,And the blood poured forth like wine.
2729,MY MOCKING-BIRD,The soul of song in your gentle breast
2730,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"Died in that hour of fierce unrest,"
2731,MY MOCKING-BIRD,"When like a spectre grim and wan,"
2732,MY MOCKING-BIRD,You watched to see how the strife went on.
2733,MY MOCKING-BIRD,
2734,MY MOCKING-BIRD,
2735,COMING HOME,COMING HOME
2736,COMING HOME,
2737,COMING HOME,"When the winter winds were loud,"
2738,COMING HOME,"And Earth wore a snowy shroud,"
2739,COMING HOME,"Oft our darling wrote to us,"
2740,COMING HOME,And the words ran ever thus—
2741,COMING HOME,“I am coming in the spring!
2742,COMING HOME,"With the mayflower’s blossoming,"
2743,COMING HOME,"With the young leaves on the tree,"
2744,COMING HOME,"O my dear ones, look for me!”"
2745,COMING HOME,
2746,COMING HOME,"And she came. One dreary day,"
2747,COMING HOME,"When the skies were dull and gray,"
2748,COMING HOME,Softly through the open door
2749,COMING HOME,Our belovèd came once more.
2750,COMING HOME,Came with folded hands that lay
2751,COMING HOME,Very quietly alway—
2752,COMING HOME,"Came with heavy-lidded eyes,"
2753,COMING HOME,Lifted not in glad surprise.
2754,COMING HOME,
2755,COMING HOME,Not a single word she spoke;
2756,COMING HOME,Laugh nor sigh her silence broke
2757,COMING HOME,"As across the quiet room,"
2758,COMING HOME,"Darkening in the twilight gloom,"
2759,COMING HOME,"On she passed in stillest guise,"
2760,COMING HOME,"Calm as saint in Paradise,"
2761,COMING HOME,To the spot where—woe betide!—
2762,COMING HOME,Four years since she stood a bride.
2763,COMING HOME,
2764,COMING HOME,"Then, you think, we sprang to greet her—"
2765,COMING HOME,"Sprang with outstretched hands, to meet her;"
2766,COMING HOME,"Clasped her in our arms once more,"
2767,COMING HOME,As in happy days of yore;
2768,COMING HOME,"Poured warm kisses on her cheek,"
2769,COMING HOME,"Passive lips and forehead meek,"
2770,COMING HOME,Till the barrier melted down
2771,COMING HOME,That had thus between us grown.
2772,COMING HOME,
2773,COMING HOME,"Ah no!—Darling, did you know"
2774,COMING HOME,When we bent above you so?
2775,COMING HOME,"When our tears fell down like rain,"
2776,COMING HOME,And our hearts were wild with pain?
2777,COMING HOME,"Did you pity us that day,"
2778,COMING HOME,Even as holy angels may
2779,COMING HOME,"Pity mortals here below,"
2780,COMING HOME,While they wonder at their woe?
2781,COMING HOME,
2782,COMING HOME,Who can tell us? Word nor sign
2783,COMING HOME,Came from those pale lips of thine;
2784,COMING HOME,Loving hearts and yearning breast
2785,COMING HOME,"Lay in coldest, calmest rest."
2786,COMING HOME,Is thy Heaven so very fair
2787,COMING HOME,That thou dost forget us there?
2788,COMING HOME,"Speak, belovèd! Woe is me"
2789,COMING HOME,That in vain I call on thee!

2793,WAKENING EARLY,
2794,WAKENING EARLY,"In loving jest you wrote—“Ah, me!"
2795,WAKENING EARLY,My babe’s blue eyes are fair to see;
2796,WAKENING EARLY,And sweet his cooing love-notes be
2797,WAKENING EARLY,That waken me too early!”
2798,WAKENING EARLY,
2799,WAKENING EARLY,"Oh! would to God, beloved, to-day"
2800,WAKENING EARLY,That merry shout or gleeful play
2801,WAKENING EARLY,"Might drive your heavy sleep away,"
2802,WAKENING EARLY,And bid you waken early.
2803,WAKENING EARLY,
2804,WAKENING EARLY,But vain are all our prayers and cries;
2805,WAKENING EARLY,From your low bed you will not rise;
2806,WAKENING EARLY,"No kisses falling on your eyes,"

2808,WAKENING EARLY,
2809,WAKENING EARLY,"Bright are the skies above your bed,"

3367,(DRIFTWOOD),"Thou hast proved that while man can still battle for truth,"
3368,(DRIFTWOOD),"Even boyhood can give up the promise of youth,"

3425,(DRIFTWOOD),"Could we but see thee with thy solemn eyes,"
3426,(DRIFTWOOD),In whose rare depths such wondrous meaning lies—
3427,(DRIFTWOOD),Thy dark robes sweeping this enchanted ground—
3428,(DRIFTWOOD),Thy midnight hair with purple pansies crowned—
3429,(DRIFTWOOD),"Thy lip so sadly sweet, thy brow serene!"
3430,(DRIFTWOOD),"There is no expectation in thy mien,"
3431,(DRIFTWOOD),For thou hast done with dreams. Nor joy nor pain
3432,(DRIFTWOOD),Can e’er disturb thy placid calm again.
3433,(DRIFTWOOD),What is this veil that hides thee from our sight?

3439,(DRIFTWOOD),"Weary and worn and tempest-tossed,"
3440,(DRIFTWOOD),Much have we gained—and something lost—
3441,(DRIFTWOOD),"Since in the sunbeams golden glow,"
3442,(DRIFTWOOD),"The rippling river’s silvery flow,"
3443,(DRIFTWOOD),"The song of bird or murmuring bee,"
3444,(DRIFTWOOD),"The fragrant flower, the stately tree,"
3445,(DRIFTWOOD),"The royal pomp of sunset skies,"
3446,(DRIFTWOOD),"And all earth’s varied harmonies,"
3447,(DRIFTWOOD),We saw and heard what nevermore
3448,(DRIFTWOOD),"Can Earth or Heaven to us restore,"
3449,(DRIFTWOOD),And felt a child’s unquestioning faith
3450,(DRIFTWOOD),In childhood’s mystic lore!

3454,(DRIFTWOOD),Yet could our voices reach the slumbering dead
3455,(DRIFTWOOD),"Who rest so calmly in yon grass-grown bed,"
3456,(DRIFTWOOD),This truth would seem with greatest wonder fraught—
3457,(DRIFTWOOD),_That they are heroes to our eyes and thought_.
3458,(DRIFTWOOD),For they were men who never dreamed of fame:
3459,(DRIFTWOOD),They did not toil to make themselves a name;
3460,(DRIFTWOOD),"They little fancied that when years had passed,"
3461,(DRIFTWOOD),"And the long century had died at last,"
3462,(DRIFTWOOD),"Another age should make their graves a shrine,"
3463,(DRIFTWOOD),And humble chaplets for their memory twine.
3464,(DRIFTWOOD),"They simply strove, as other men may strive,"
3465,(DRIFTWOOD),"Full, earnest lives in sober strength to live;"
3466,(DRIFTWOOD),They did the duty nearest to their hand;
3467,(DRIFTWOOD),Subdued wild nature as at God’s command;
3468,(DRIFTWOOD),"Laid the broad acres open to the sun,"
3469,(DRIFTWOOD),And made fair homes in forests dark and dun;
3470,(DRIFTWOOD),"Built churches, founded schools, established laws,"
3471,(DRIFTWOOD),Kindly and just and true to freedom’s cause;
3472,(DRIFTWOOD),"Resisted wrong, and with stout hands and hearts,"
3473,(DRIFTWOOD),"In war, as well as peace, played well their parts."
3474,(DRIFTWOOD),Their men were brave; their women pure and true;
3475,(DRIFTWOOD),Their sons ashamed no honest work to do;
3476,(DRIFTWOOD),"And while they dreamed no dreams of being great,"
3477,(DRIFTWOOD),"They did great deeds, and conquered hostile Fate."
3478,(DRIFTWOOD),"We laud them, we praise them, we bless them to-day;"
3479,(DRIFTWOOD),"At their graves, as their right, tearful homage we pay!"
3480,(DRIFTWOOD),"And the laurel-crowned Present comes humbly at last,"
3481,(DRIFTWOOD),And bends by our side at the shrine of the Past.
3482,(DRIFTWOOD),"With the hands that such burdens unshrinking have borne,"
3483,(DRIFTWOOD),"From the brow weary cares have so furrowed and worn,"
3484,(DRIFTWOOD),"She takes off the chaplet, and lays it with tears,"
3485,(DRIFTWOOD),"That she cares not to hide, at the feet of the Years."
3486,(DRIFTWOOD),"Hark! a breath of faint music, a murmur of song!"
3487,(DRIFTWOOD),A form of strange beauty is floating along
3488,(DRIFTWOOD),"On the soft summer air, and the Future draws near,"
3489,(DRIFTWOOD),"With a light on her young face, unshadowed and clear."
3490,(DRIFTWOOD),Two garlands she bears in the arms that not yet
3491,(DRIFTWOOD),Have toiled ’neath the burden and heat of the day;
3492,(DRIFTWOOD),"Lo! both are of amaranth, fragrant and wet"
3493,(DRIFTWOOD),"With the dew of remembrance, and fadeless alway."
3494,(DRIFTWOOD),Oh! well may we hush our vain babblings—and wait!
3495,(DRIFTWOOD),"He who merits the crown, wears it sooner or late!"
3496,(DRIFTWOOD),"On the brow of the Present, the grave of the Past,"
3497,(DRIFTWOOD),The wreaths they have earned shall rest surely at last!

3734,VIII.,Prophet and herald of the good to be;
3735,VIII.,"And on its humbler way, in calm content,"
3736,VIII.,"The lesser State, the while, serenely went."
3737,VIII.,"Safe in her mountain fastnesses she dwelt,"
3738,VIII.,"Her life’s first cares forgot, its woes unfelt,"

3746,IX.,A cry that rent her with grief and shame—
3747,IX.,"A cry from the Nation in sore distress,"
3748,IX.,Stricken down in the pride of its mightiness!
3749,IX.,"With passionate ardor up she sprang,"
3750,IX.,And her voice like the peal of a trumpet rang—
3751,IX.,"“What ho! what ho! brave sons of mine,"
3752,IX.,Strong with the strength of the mountain pine!
3753,IX.,"To the front of the battle, away! away!"
3754,IX.,"The Nation is bleeding in deadly fray,"
3755,IX.,"The Nation, it may be, is dying to-day!"
3756,IX.,"On, then, to the rescue! away! away!”"

3761,X.,"Ah! how they answered let the ages tell,"

3763,X.,Green grows the grass to-day on many a battle-field;
3764,X.,War’s dread alarms are o’er; its scars are healed;
3765,X.,Its bitter agony has found surcease;
3766,X.,A re-united land clasps hands in peace.
3767,X.,"But, oh! ye blessed dead, whose graves are strown"
3768,X.,"From where our forests make perpetual moan,"
3769,X.,To those far shores where smiling Southern seas
3770,X.,Give back soft murmurs to the fragrant breeze—
3771,X.,"Oh! ye who drained for us the bitter cup,"
3772,X.,Think ye we can forget what ye have offered up?
3773,X.,"The years will come and go, and other centuries die,"

3790,XI.,What though the Nation rose
3791,XI.,Triumphant o’er its foes?
3792,XI.,What though the State had gained
3793,XI.,The meed of faith unstained?
3794,XI.,Their mighty hearts remembered the dead that came no more!
3795,XI.,"Remembered all the losses,"
3796,XI.,"The weary, weary crosses,"
3797,XI.,"Remembered earth was poorer for the blood that had been shed,"
3798,XI.,And knew that it was sadder for the story it had read!
3799,XI.,"So, clasping hands with somewhat saddened mien,"
3800,XI.,And eyes uplifted to the Great Unseen
3801,XI.,"That rules alike o’er Centuries and men,"

3809,XII.,How the whole world bowed down beside its bier;
3810,XII.,"How all the Nations came, from far or near,"
3811,XII.,Heaping their treasures on its mighty pall—
3812,XII.,Never had kingliest king such funeral!
3813,XII.,"Old Asia rose, and, girding her in haste,"
3814,XII.,"Swept in her jewelled robes across the waste,"
3815,XII.,And called to Egypt lying prone and hid
3816,XII.,Where waits the Sphinx beside the pyramid;
3817,XII.,"Fair Europe came with overflowing hands,"
3818,XII.,Bearing the riches of her many lands;
3819,XII.,"Dark Afric, laden with her virgin gold,"
3820,XII.,Yet laden deeper with her woes untold;
3821,XII.,"Japan and China in grotesque array,"
3822,XII.,And all the enchanted islands of Cathay!

3830,XIII.,Were fixed upon it.
3831,XIII.,Earth may not pause to lay
3832,XIII.,"A wreath upon its bier,"
3833,XIII.,Nor the world heed to-day
3834,XIII.,Our dead that lieth here!
3835,XIII.,
3836,XIII.,Yet well they loved each other—
3837,XIII.,It and its greater brother.
3838,XIII.,"To loftiest stature grown,"
3839,XIII.,Each earned its own renown;
3840,XIII.,"Each sought of Time a crown,"

3845,XIV.,
3846,XIV.,"But what to us are Centuries dead,"
3847,XIV.,"And rolling Years forever fled,"

3849,XIV.,Vermont—our Goddess-mother?
3850,XIV.,"Strong with the strength of thy verdant hills,"
3851,XIV.,"Fresh with the freshness of mountain-rills,"
3852,XIV.,"Pure as the breath of the fragrant pine,"
3853,XIV.,"Glad with the gladness of youth divine,"
3854,XIV.,Serenely thou sittest throned to-day
3855,XIV.,Where the free winds that round thee play
3856,XIV.,"Rejoice in thy waves of sun-bright hair,"

3860,XIV.,"Thou art not old with thy hundred years,"
3861,XIV.,"Nor worn with toil, or care, or tears:"
3862,XIV.,But all the glow of the summer-time
3863,XIV.,Is thine to-day in thy glorious prime!
3864,XIV.,"Thy brow is fair as the winter-snows,"
3865,XIV.,With a stately calm in its still repose;
3866,XIV.,"While the breath of the rose the wild bee sips,"
3867,XIV.,"Half-mad with joy, cannot eclipse"
3868,XIV.,The marvellous sweetness of thy lips;
3869,XIV.,And the deepest blue of the laughing skies
3870,XIV.,"Hides in the depths of thy fearless eyes,"
3871,XIV.,Gazing afar over land and sea
3872,XIV.,Wherever thy wandering children be!
3873,XIV.,"Fold on fold,"
3874,XIV.,Over thy form of grandest mould
3875,XIV.,"Floweth thy robe of forest green,"
3876,XIV.,"Now light, now dark, in its emerald sheen."
3877,XIV.,"Its broidered hem is of wild flowers rare,"
3878,XIV.,With feathery fern-fronds light as air
3879,XIV.,Fringing its borders. In thy hair
3880,XIV.,"Sprays of the pink arbutus twine,"
3881,XIV.,And the curling rings of the wild grape vine.
3882,XIV.,Thy girdle is woven of silver streams;
3883,XIV.,Its clasp with the opaline lustre gleams
3884,XIV.,Of a lake asleep in the sunset beams;
3885,XIV.,"And, half concealing"

4210,"AUGUST 8, 1885",A great white angel through the far

4212,"AUGUST 8, 1885",
4213,"AUGUST 8, 1885","Until below it our fair earth,"
4214,"AUGUST 8, 1885",Like a rich jewel fitly hung—
4215,"AUGUST 8, 1885",An emerald set with silver gleams—

4217,"AUGUST 8, 1885",

4222,"AUGUST 8, 1885",
4223,"AUGUST 8, 1885","Poised on a far blue mountain peak,"
4224,"AUGUST 8, 1885","It saw the land, from sea to sea,"
4225,"AUGUST 8, 1885",Lifting in veilèd splendor up
4226,"AUGUST 8, 1885",The banner of the free!
4227,"AUGUST 8, 1885",
4228,"AUGUST 8, 1885","From tower and turret, spire and dome,"

4231,"AUGUST 8, 1885","In awful solitude,"
4232,"AUGUST 8, 1885",
4233,"AUGUST 8, 1885","It saw strange, sombre pennants float,"

4235,"AUGUST 8, 1885","That bore, from shore to shore, the wail"
4236,"AUGUST 8, 1885",Of solemn symphonies.
4237,"AUGUST 8, 1885",
4238,"AUGUST 8, 1885","It saw long files of armèd men,"

4240,"AUGUST 8, 1885",Pass up and down the sorrowing land
4241,"AUGUST 8, 1885",As if in grand review.

4243,"AUGUST 8, 1885","It saw through crowded city streets,"
4244,"AUGUST 8, 1885","Funereal trains move to and fro,"
4245,"AUGUST 8, 1885","With tolling bells, and muffled drums,"
4246,"AUGUST 8, 1885",And trumpets wailing low.
4247,"AUGUST 8, 1885",
4248,"AUGUST 8, 1885",Descending then the angel sought

4251,"AUGUST 8, 1885","With angels, unawares!"
4252,"AUGUST 8, 1885",
4253,"AUGUST 8, 1885","The angel spake, as man to man—"

4255,"AUGUST 8, 1885","“These sad-browed hosts, these weeds of woe,"
4256,"AUGUST 8, 1885",This mourning far and wide?”
4257,"AUGUST 8, 1885",
4258,"AUGUST 8, 1885",The stranger answered in amaze—
4259,"AUGUST 8, 1885",“Know you not what the whole world knows?

4268,"AUGUST 8, 1885","The angel sighed. “That means,” it said,"

4271,"AUGUST 8, 1885",By the fierce cannon’s breath!”

4283,"AUGUST 8, 1885",Still saw long ranks of armèd men

4320,FRIAR ANSELMO,
4321,FRIAR ANSELMO,FRIAR ANSELMO for a secret sin
4322,FRIAR ANSELMO,Sat bowed with grief the convent cell within;
4323,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Nor dared, such was his shame, to lift his eyes"
4324,FRIAR ANSELMO,"To the low wall whereon, in dreadful guise,"
4325,FRIAR ANSELMO,"The dead CHRIST hung upon the cursèd tree,"
4326,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Frowning, he thought, upon his misery."
4327,FRIAR ANSELMO,What was his sin it matters not to tell.
4328,FRIAR ANSELMO,"But he was young and strong, the records say:"
4329,FRIAR ANSELMO,Perhaps he wearied of his narrow cell;
4330,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Perhaps he longed to work, as well as pray;"
4331,FRIAR ANSELMO,Perhaps his heart too warmly beat that day!
4332,FRIAR ANSELMO,Perhaps—for life is long—the weary road
4333,FRIAR ANSELMO,"That he must travel, bearing as a load"
4334,FRIAR ANSELMO,"The slow, monotonous hours that, one by one,"
4335,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Dragged in a lengthening chain from sun to sun,"
4336,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Appalled his eager spirit, and his vow"
4337,FRIAR ANSELMO,Pressed like an iron hand upon his brow.
4338,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Perhaps some dream of love, of home, of wife,"
4339,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Had stirred this tumult in his lonely life,"
4340,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Tempting his soul to barter heavenly bliss,"
4341,FRIAR ANSELMO,And sell its birthright for a woman’s kiss!
4342,FRIAR ANSELMO,"At all events, the struggle had been hard;"
4343,FRIAR ANSELMO,"And as a bird from the glad ether barred,"
4344,FRIAR ANSELMO,"So had he beat his wings till, bruised and torn,"
4345,FRIAR ANSELMO,He wished that night he never had been born!
4346,FRIAR ANSELMO,And still the dead CHRIST on the cursèd tree
4347,FRIAR ANSELMO,Seemed but to mock his hopeless misery;
4348,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Still Mary mother turned her eyes away,"
4349,FRIAR ANSELMO,Nor saint nor angel bent to hear him pray!
4350,FRIAR ANSELMO,
4351,FRIAR ANSELMO,"The calm, cold moonlight through the casement shone;"
4352,FRIAR ANSELMO,Weird shadows darkened on the floor of stone;
4353,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Without, what solemn splendors! and within"
4354,FRIAR ANSELMO,What fearful wrestlings with despair and sin!
4355,FRIAR ANSELMO,Sudden and loud the cloister bell outrang;
4356,FRIAR ANSELMO,Afar a door swung to with sullen clang;
4357,FRIAR ANSELMO,"And overhead he heard the rhythmic beat,"
4358,FRIAR ANSELMO,The measured monotone of many feet
4359,FRIAR ANSELMO,Seeking the chapel for the midnight prayer.
4360,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Black wings seemed hovering round him in the air,"
4361,FRIAR ANSELMO,Beating him back when with a stifled moan
4362,FRIAR ANSELMO,He would have sought the holy altar stone.
4363,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Then with a swift, sharp cry, prostrate he fell"
4364,FRIAR ANSELMO,Before the crucifix. “The gates of hell
4365,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Shall not prevail against me!” loud he cried,"
4366,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Stretching his arms to CHRIST, the crucified."
4367,FRIAR ANSELMO,"“By Thy dread cross, Thy dying agony,"
4368,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Thine awful passion, LORD, deliver me!”"
4369,FRIAR ANSELMO,
4370,FRIAR ANSELMO,Was it a dream? The taunting demons fled;
4371,FRIAR ANSELMO,Through the dim cell a wondrous glory spread;
4372,FRIAR ANSELMO,And all the air was filled with rare perfumes
4373,FRIAR ANSELMO,Wafted from censers rich with heavenly blooms.
4374,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Transfigured stood the CHRIST before his eyes,"
4375,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Clothed in white samite, woven in Paradise,"
4376,FRIAR ANSELMO,And from the empty cross upon the wall
4377,FRIAR ANSELMO,Streamed a wide splendor that encompassed all!
4378,FRIAR ANSELMO,Was it a dream? Anselmo’s sight grew dim;
4379,FRIAR ANSELMO,The cloistered chamber seemed to reel and swim;
4380,FRIAR ANSELMO,"Yet well his spirit knew the glorious guest,"
4381,FRIAR ANSELMO,And all his manhood rose to meet the test.
4382,FRIAR ANSELMO,"“What wilt Thou have me, LORD, to do?” he cried"
4383,FRIAR ANSELMO,"With pallid lips, and kissed the sacred feet."
4384,FRIAR ANSELMO,"And then in accents strangely calm, yet sweet,"
4385,FRIAR ANSELMO,"These words he heard from CHRIST, the crucified,"
4386,FRIAR ANSELMO,"The pitying CHRIST his inmost soul who read,"
4387,FRIAR ANSELMO,"With all its wild unrest, its doubt and dread:"
4388,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”
4389,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,Then mystic presences about him stirred;
4390,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,The vision faded. At the dawn of day
4391,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,Prostrate and pallid in the dusk he lay.
4392,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,Was it a dream? GOD knows! The narrow cell
4393,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"Wore the old aspect he had learned so well,"

4396,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,Yet still a subtile fragrance filled the room;
4397,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"And looking round him in the soft, gray gloom,"
4398,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,Anselmo saw upon the fretted floor
4399,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,An eagle’s quill that this grave legend bore:

4402,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,
4403,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"Henceforth Anselmo prayed, but worked as well,"
4404,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,Nor felt the bondage of his cloister cell;
4405,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"For all his soul was filled with high intent,"
4406,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,He had no dream since its accomplishment—
4407,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"To make a copy of the Holy Word,"
4408,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"Fairer than eye had seen, or ear had heard,"
4409,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"Or heart conceived of! Day by day he wrought,"
4410,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,His fingers guided by a single thought;
4411,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"Forming each letter with the tenderest care,"
4412,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,With points of richest color here and there;
4413,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"With birds on swaying boughs, and butterflies"
4414,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,Poised on gay wings o’er sprays of eglantine;
4415,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,With tangled tracery of flower and vine
4416,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"Through which gleamed cherub faces, half divine;"

4419,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"Each word an orison, each line a prayer!"

4425,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"Bent, a gray monk, above the parchment page."
4426,“MAKE THOU A COPY OF MY HOLY WORD!”,"Death waited till he wrote the last fair line,"

4533,PERADVENTURE,"Somewhere, I know, he has lived them through,"
4534,PERADVENTURE,Perhaps with never a thought or dream
4535,PERADVENTURE,Of the mother-heart he never knew!
4536,PERADVENTURE,
4537,PERADVENTURE,Is he yet but a babe? or has he grown
4538,PERADVENTURE,"To be like his brothers, fair and tall,"
4539,PERADVENTURE,"With a clear, bright eye, and a springing step,"
4540,PERADVENTURE,And a voice that rings like a bugle call?
4541,PERADVENTURE,
4542,PERADVENTURE,I loved him. The rose in his waxen hand
4543,PERADVENTURE,Was wet with the dew of my falling tears;
4544,PERADVENTURE,I have kept the thought of my baby’s grave
4545,PERADVENTURE,Through all the length of these changeful years.
4546,PERADVENTURE,
4547,PERADVENTURE,Yet the love I gave him was not like that
4548,PERADVENTURE,"I give to-day to my other boys,"
4549,PERADVENTURE,"Who have grown beside me, and turned to me"
4550,PERADVENTURE,In all their griefs and in all their joys.
4551,PERADVENTURE,
4552,PERADVENTURE,Do you think he knows it? I wonder much
4553,PERADVENTURE,"If the dead are passionless, cold, and dumb;"
4554,PERADVENTURE,If into the calm of the deathless years
4555,PERADVENTURE,No thrill of a human love may come!
4556,PERADVENTURE,
4557,PERADVENTURE,Perhaps sometimes from the upper air
4558,PERADVENTURE,He has seen me walk with his brothers three;
4559,PERADVENTURE,Or felt in the tender twilight hour
4560,PERADVENTURE,The breath of the kisses they gave to me!
4561,PERADVENTURE,
4562,PERADVENTURE,"Over his birthright, lost so soon,"
4563,PERADVENTURE,Perhaps he has sighed as the swift years flew;
4564,PERADVENTURE,O child of my heart! you shall find somewhere
4565,PERADVENTURE,The love that on earth you never knew!

4572,I.,I.
4573,I.,
4574,I.,"St. Gudula’s bells were chiming for the midnight, sad and slow,"
4575,I.,"In the ancient town of Brussels, many and many a year ago,"
4576,I.,
4577,I.,"And St. Michael, poised so grandly on his lofty, airy height,"
4578,I.,"Seemed transfigured in the glory of the full moon’s tender light,"
4579,I.,
4580,I.,"When, a fair and saintly maiden crowned with locks of palest gold,"
4581,I.,"Rena stood beside her lover, son of Hildebrand the Bold."
4582,I.,
4583,I.,She with grief and tears was pallid; but his face was hard and
4584,I.,stern:
4585,I.,All the passion of his being in his dark eyes seemed to burn.
4586,I.,
4587,I.,"“Never dream that I will give thee back thy plighted faith,” he"
4588,I.,"cried,"
4589,I.,"“By St. Michael’s sword I swear it, thou, my love, shalt be my"
4590,I.,bride!”
4591,I.,
4592,I.,"“Nay, but hear me,” she responded; “hear the words that I must"
4593,I.,speak;
4594,I.,"I must speak, and thou must hearken, though my heart is like to"
4595,I.,break.
4596,I.,
4597,I.,"Yestermorn, as I sat spinning blithely at my cottage door,"
4598,I.,Straightway fell a stately shadow in the sunshine on the floor;
4599,I.,
4600,I.,"And a figure stood before me, so majestic and so grand,"
4601,I.,That I knew it in a moment for the mighty Hildebrand—
4602,I.,
4603,I.,"Stood and gazed on me till downward at my feet the distaff dropped,"
4604,I.,And in all my veins the pulsing of the swift life-current stopped.
4605,I.,
4606,I.,"‘Thou art Rena,’ then he uttered, and he swore a dreadful oath,"
4607,I.,And the tempest of his anger beat on me and on us both.
4608,I.,
4609,I.,"‘She who thinks to wed with Volmar must have lands and gold,’ said"
4610,I.,"he,"
4611,I.,"‘Or must come of noble lineage, fit to mate with mine and me!"
4612,I.,
4613,I.,"Thou art but a peasant maiden, empty-handed, lowly born;"
4614,I.,All the ladies of my castle would look down on thee with scorn.
4615,I.,
4616,I.,"Even he will weary of thee when his passion once is spent,"
4617,I.,Vainly cursing her who doomed him to an endless discontent!’
4618,I.,
4619,I.,"Then I, trembling, rose up slowly, and I looked him in the face,"
4620,I.,Though the dreadful frown it wore seemed to darken all the place.
4621,I.,
4622,I.,"‘Sir, I thank you for this warning,’ said I, speaking low and clear,"
4623,I.,‘But the laughter of your ladies I must teach my heart to bear.
4624,I.,
4625,I.,For the rest—your son is noble—and my simple womanhood
4626,I.,"He will hold in loving honor, as a saint the holy rood!’"
4627,I.,
4628,I.,"Oh! then his stern face whitened, and a bitter laugh laughed he:"
4629,I.,"‘Truly this my son is noble, and he shall not wed with thee."
4630,I.,
4631,I.,"Hear my words now, and remember! for by this good sword I swear,"
4632,I.,"And by Michael standing yonder, watching us from upper air,"
4633,I.,
4634,I.,"If he dares to place a wedding-ring upon your dowerless hand,"
4635,I.,On his head shall fall a father’s curse—the curse of Hildebrand!’
4636,I.,
4637,I.,"O, my Volmar! Then the earth rocked, and I fell down in a swoon;"
4638,I.,When I woke the room was silent; it was past the hour of noon;
4639,I.,
4640,I.,"And I waited for thy coming, as the captive waits for death,"
4641,I.,"With a mingled dread and longing, and a half-abated breath!”"
4642,I.,
4643,I.,"Straight the young man bowed before her, as before a holy shrine:"
4644,I.,“Never hand of high-born lady was more richly dowered than thine!
4645,I.,
4646,I.,"What care I for gold or honors, or—my—father’s—curse?” he said;"
4647,I.,"But the words died out in shudders, and his face grew like the dead."
4648,I.,
4649,I.,"Then she twined her white arms round him, and she murmured, sweet"
4650,I.,"and low,"
4651,I.,As the night wind breathing softly over banks where violets blow:
4652,I.,
4653,I.,"“‘He who is accursed of father, he shall be accursed of God,’"
4654,I.,Long ago said one who followed where the holy prophets trod.
4655,I.,
4656,I.,"Kiss me once, then, O my Volmar! just once more, my Volmar dear,"
4657,I.,Even as you would kiss my white lips if I lay upon my bier!
4658,I.,
4659,I.,For a gulf as dark as death has opened wide ’twixt thee and me;
4660,I.,"Neither thou nor I can cross it, and thy wife I may not be!”"
4661,I.,
4662,I.,
4663,II.,II.
4664,II.,
4665,II.,"Once again the bells of midnight chimed from St. Gudula’s towers,"
4666,II.,While St. Michael watched the city slumbering through the ghostly
4667,II.,hours.
4668,II.,
4669,II.,"But no slumber came to Rena where she moaned in bitter pain,"
4670,II.,For the anguish of that parting wrought its work on heart and brain.
4671,II.,
4672,II.,"Suddenly the air grew heavy as with magical perfume,"
4673,II.,And a weird and wondrous splendor filled the dim and silent room.
4674,II.,
4675,II.,"In the middle of the chamber stood a lady fair and sweet,"
4676,II.,With bright tresses falling softly to her small and sandalled feet.
4677,II.,
4678,II.,"Flushed her cheeks were as a wild rose, and the glory of her eyes"
4679,II.,Was the laughing light and glory of the kindling morning skies.
4680,II.,
4681,II.,Airy robes of lightest tissue from her white arms floated free;
4682,II.,"They seemed woven of the mist that curls above the azure sea,"
4683,II.,
4684,II.,"Wrought in curious devices, star and wheel and leaf and flower,"
4685,II.,"That, like frost upon a window-pane, might vanish in an hour."
4686,II.,
4687,II.,"In her hands she bore a cushion, quaintly fashioned, strangely set"
4688,II.,With small silver pins that spanned it like a branching coronet;
4689,II.,
4690,II.,"And from threads of finest texture swung light bobbins to and fro,"
4691,II.,As the lady stood illumined in the weird and wondrous glow.
4692,II.,
4693,II.,"Not a single word she uttered; but, as silent as a shade,"
4694,II.,Down the room she swiftly glided and beside the startled maid
4695,II.,
4696,II.,"Knelt, a radiant vision, smiling into Rena’s wondering eyes,"
4697,II.,Giving arch yet gracious answer to her tremulous surprise.
4698,II.,
4699,II.,"Then she laid the satin cushion on the wondering maiden’s knee,"
4700,II.,"And to all her mute bewilderment, no syllable spake she."
4701,II.,
4702,II.,"But, as in and out and round about, the silver pins among,"
4703,II.,"Flashed the white hand of the lady, and the shining bobbins swung,"
4704,II.,
4705,II.,"Lo! a web of fairy lightness like the misty robe she wore,"
4706,II.,"Swiftly grew beneath her fingers, drifting downward to the floor!"
4707,II.,
4708,II.,"And as Rena looked and wondered, inch by inch the marvel grew,"
4709,II.,Till the eastern windows brightened as the gray dawn struggled
4710,II.,through.
4711,II.,
4712,II.,"Then the lady’s hand touched Rena’s, and she pointed far away,"
4713,II.,Where the palace towers were gleaming in the first red light of day.
4714,II.,
4715,II.,"But when once again the maiden turned her glance within the room,"
4716,II.,With the lady fair had vanished all the splendor and perfume.
4717,II.,
4718,II.,"Still the satin cushion lay there, quaintly fashioned, strangely set"
4719,II.,With the silver pins that spanned it like a branching coronet;
4720,II.,
4721,II.,"Still the light web she had woven lay in drifts upon the floor,"
4722,II.,"Like the mist wreaths resting softly on some lone, enchanted shore!"
4723,II.,
4724,II.,
4725,III.,III.
4726,III.,
4727,III.,"Slowly Rena raised the cushion, with her sweet eyes shining clear,"
4728,III.,"Lightly tossed the fairy bobbins, half in gladness, half in fear."
4729,III.,
4730,III.,Ah! not vain had been her watching as the lovely lady wrought;
4731,III.,All the magic of her fingers her own cunning hand had caught!
4732,III.,
4733,III.,"Many a day above the cushion Rena’s peerless head was bent,"
4734,III.,And through many a solemn night she labored on with sweet intent.
4735,III.,
4736,III.,"For, mayhap, the mystic marvels that she wove might bring her gold—"
4737,III.,A fair dowry fit to match the pride of Hildebrand the Bold!
4738,III.,
4739,III.,"Then she braided up her long hair, and put on her russet gown,"
4740,III.,"And with wicker basket laden passed she swiftly through the town,"
4741,III.,
4742,III.,"To the palace where Queen Ildegar, with dames of high degree,"
4743,III.,"In a lofty oriel window sat, the beauteous morn to see."
4744,III.,
4745,III.,"In the door-way she stood meekly, till the queen said, “Maiden fair,"
4746,III.,What have you in yonder basket that you carry with such care?”
4747,III.,
4748,III.,"Eagerly she raised her blue eyes, hovering smiles and tears between,"
4749,III.,"Then across the room she glided, and knelt down before the queen."
4750,III.,
4751,III.,"Lifting up the wicker cover, “Saints in heaven!” cried Ildegar,"
4752,III.,"“Here are tissues fit for angels, wrought with wreath and point and"
4753,III.,"star,"
4754,III.,
4755,III.,In most curious devices! Never saw I aught so rare—
4756,III.,Where found you these frail webs woven of the lightest summer air?”
4757,III.,
4758,III.,"“Well they may be fit for angels,” said she, underneath her breath;"
4759,III.,"“O my lady, hear a story that is strange and true as death.”"
4760,III.,
4761,III.,"But ere yet the tale was ended, up rose good Queen Ildegar,"
4762,III.,And she sent her knights and pages to the castle riding far.
4763,III.,
4764,III.,"“Bring me Hildebrand and Volmar, ere the sun goes down!” she cried,"
4765,III.,"“Ho! my ladies, for a wedding, and your queen shall bless the bride!"
4766,III.,
4767,III.,"I will buy these airy wonders, and this maiden in her hand"
4768,III.,Shall a dowry hold as royal as the noblest in the land.”
4769,III.,
4770,III.,"So they combed her shining tresses, and they brought her robes of"
4771,III.,"silk,"
4772,III.,"Broidered thick with gold and silver, on a ground as white as milk."
4773,III.,
4774,III.,"But she whispered, “Sweetest ladies, let me wear my russet gown,"
4775,III.,That I wore this happy morning walking blithely through the town.
4776,III.,
4777,III.,"I am but a peasant maiden, all unused to grand estate,"
4778,III.,"And for robes of silken splendor, dearest ladies, let me wait!”"
4779,III.,
4780,III.,"Then the good queen, smiling brightly, from the wicker basket took"
4781,III.,"Lightest web of quaintest pattern, and its filmy folds out-shook."
4782,III.,
4783,III.,"With her own white hand she laid it over Rena’s golden hair,"
4784,III.,"And she cried, “Oh, look, my ladies! Ne’er before was bride so fair!”"
4785,III.,
4786,III.,
4787,A SECRET,A SECRET
4788,A SECRET,
4789,A SECRET,
4790,A SECRET,"It is your secret and mine, love!"
4791,A SECRET,"Ah, me! how the dreary rain"
4792,A SECRET,"With a slow persistence, all day long"
4793,A SECRET,Dropped on the window-pane!
4794,A SECRET,The chamber was weird with shadows
4795,A SECRET,And dark with the deepening gloom
4796,A SECRET,"Where you in your royal womanhood,"
4797,A SECRET,Lay waiting for the tomb.
4798,A SECRET,
4799,A SECRET,"They had robed you all in white, love;"
4800,A SECRET,In your hair was a single rose—
4801,A SECRET,A marble rose it might well have been
4802,A SECRET,In its cold and still repose!
4803,A SECRET,"O, paler than yonder carven saint,"
4804,A SECRET,"And calm as the angels are,"
4805,A SECRET,"You seemed so near me, my beloved,"
4806,A SECRET,"Yet were, alas, so far!"
4807,A SECRET,
4808,A SECRET,"I do not know if I wept, love;"
4809,A SECRET,But my soul rose up and said—
4810,A SECRET,"“My heart shall speak unto her heart,"
4811,A SECRET,Though here she is lying—dead!
4812,A SECRET,I will give her a last love-token
4813,A SECRET,That shall be to her a sign
4814,A SECRET,In the dark grave—or beyond it—
4815,A SECRET,Of this deathless love of mine.”
4816,A SECRET,
4817,A SECRET,"So I sought me a little scroll, love;"
4818,A SECRET,"And thereon, in eager haste,"
4819,A SECRET,Lest another’s eye should read them
4820,A SECRET,Some mystic words I traced.
4821,A SECRET,"Then close in your claspèd fingers,"
4822,A SECRET,"Close in your waxen hand,"
4823,A SECRET,"I placed the scroll for an amulet,"
4824,A SECRET,Sure you would understand!
4825,A SECRET,
4826,A SECRET,"The secret is yours and mine, love!"
4827,A SECRET,Only we two may know
4828,A SECRET,"What words shine clear in the darkness,"
4829,A SECRET,Of your grave so green and low.
4830,A SECRET,"But if when we meet hereafter,"
4831,A SECRET,"In the dawn of some fairer day,"
4832,A SECRET,"You whisper those mystical words, love,"
4833,A SECRET,It is all I would have you say!
4834,A SECRET,
4835,A SECRET,
4836,THIS DAY,THIS DAY
4837,THIS DAY,
4838,THIS DAY,"I wonder what is this day to you,"
4839,THIS DAY,Looking down from the upper skies!
4840,THIS DAY,Is there a pang at your gentle heart?
4841,THIS DAY,Is there a shade in your tender eyes?
4842,THIS DAY,Do you think up there of the whispered words
4843,THIS DAY,That thrilled your soul long years ago?
4844,THIS DAY,Does ever a haunting undertone
4845,THIS DAY,Blend with the chantings sweet and low?
4846,THIS DAY,
4847,THIS DAY,When this day dawned (if where you are
4848,THIS DAY,Skies grow red when the morn is near)
4849,THIS DAY,Did you know that before its close
4850,THIS DAY,The love once yours would be on its bier?
4851,THIS DAY,Did you know that another’s lip
4852,THIS DAY,"Would redden with kisses once your own,"
4853,THIS DAY,And the golden cup of a younger life
4854,THIS DAY,O’erflow with the wine once yours alone?
4855,THIS DAY,
4856,THIS DAY,"Do you remember? Ah, my saint,"
4857,THIS DAY,Bend your ear from the ether blue!
4858,THIS DAY,Have you risen to heights so far
4859,THIS DAY,That earth and its loves are nought to you?
4860,THIS DAY,Do you care that your place is filled?
4861,THIS DAY,Does it matter that now at last
4862,THIS DAY,The turf above you has grown so deep
4863,THIS DAY,That its shadow overlies your past?
4864,THIS DAY,
4865,THIS DAY,"O, belovèd, I may not know!"
4866,THIS DAY,"Heaven is afar, and the grave is dumb,"
4867,THIS DAY,And out of the silence so profound
4868,THIS DAY,Neither token nor voice may come!
4869,THIS DAY,We try to think that we understand;
4870,THIS DAY,"But whether you wake, or whether you sleep,"
4871,THIS DAY,"Or whether our deeds are aught to you,"
4872,THIS DAY,Is still a mystery strange and deep!
4873,THIS DAY,
4874,THIS DAY,
4875,“CHRISTUS!”,“CHRISTUS!”
4876,“CHRISTUS!”,
4877,“CHRISTUS!”,Over the desolate sea-side town
4878,“CHRISTUS!”,"With a terrible tumult the night came down,"
4879,“CHRISTUS!”,"And the fierce wind swept through the empty street,"
4880,“CHRISTUS!”,With the drifting snow for a winding-sheet.
4881,“CHRISTUS!”,"Elsie, the fisherman’s daughter, in bed"
4882,“CHRISTUS!”,"Lay and listened in awe and dread,"
4883,“CHRISTUS!”,But sprang to her feet in sudden fear
4884,“CHRISTUS!”,"When over the tempest, loud and clear,"
4885,“CHRISTUS!”,"A voice cried, “Christus!”"
4886,“CHRISTUS!”,
4887,“CHRISTUS!”,“Christus! Christus!” and nothing more.
4888,“CHRISTUS!”,Was it a cry at the cottage-door?
4889,“CHRISTUS!”,She left her chamber with flying feet;
4890,“CHRISTUS!”,She loosened the bolts with fingers fleet;
4891,“CHRISTUS!”,"She lifted the latch, but only the din"
4892,“CHRISTUS!”,Of the furious storm and the snow swept in.
4893,“CHRISTUS!”,"She looked without: not a soul was there,"
4894,“CHRISTUS!”,But still rang out on the startled air
4895,“CHRISTUS!”,"The strange cry, “Christus!”"
4896,“CHRISTUS!”,
4897,“CHRISTUS!”,"“Christus! Christus!” She slept at last,"
4898,“CHRISTUS!”,Though the old house rocked in the wintry blast;
4899,“CHRISTUS!”,"And when she awoke the world was still,"
4900,“CHRISTUS!”,"A wide, white silence from sea to hill."
4901,“CHRISTUS!”,No creature stirred in the morning glow;
4902,“CHRISTUS!”,There was not a footprint in the snow;
4903,“CHRISTUS!”,"Yet again through the hush, as faint and far"
4904,“CHRISTUS!”,"As if it came from another star,"
4905,“CHRISTUS!”,A voice sighed “Christus!”
4906,“CHRISTUS!”,
4907,“CHRISTUS!”,"“Christus! Christus!” Who can it be,"
4908,“CHRISTUS!”,"O Christ our Lord, that is calling Thee"
4909,“CHRISTUS!”,"In a foreign tongue, with a woe as wild"
4910,“CHRISTUS!”,"As that of some lost, forsaken child?"
4911,“CHRISTUS!”,She turned from the window with a startled gaze:
4912,“CHRISTUS!”,"She clasped her hands in a pale amaze,"
4913,“CHRISTUS!”,"Hearkening still, till again she heard,"
4914,“CHRISTUS!”,"As in a waking dream, the word—"
4915,“CHRISTUS!”,"That strange word, “Christus!”"
4916,“CHRISTUS!”,
4917,“CHRISTUS!”,Then over the hill with weary feet
4918,“CHRISTUS!”,She toiled through the drifts to the village-street.
4919,“CHRISTUS!”,"The villagers gathered in eager haste,"
4920,“CHRISTUS!”,And all day long in the snowy waste
4921,“CHRISTUS!”,They sought in vain for the one who cried
4922,“CHRISTUS!”,To Him who of old was crucified:
4923,“CHRISTUS!”,"Then, turning away with a laugh, they said,"
4924,“CHRISTUS!”,"“’Twas only the wild wind overhead,"
4925,“CHRISTUS!”,Your cry of ‘Christus!’”
4926,“CHRISTUS!”,
4927,“CHRISTUS!”,She watched their going with earnest eyes:
4928,“CHRISTUS!”,Hark! what voice to the taunt replies?
4929,“CHRISTUS!”,The trees were still as if struck with death;
4930,“CHRISTUS!”,The wind was soft as a baby’s breath;
4931,“CHRISTUS!”,"The sobbing sea was asleep at last,"
4932,“CHRISTUS!”,Scourged no more by the furious blast;
4933,“CHRISTUS!”,"Yet, surely as ever from human tongue"
4934,“CHRISTUS!”,"A cry of grief or despair was wrung,"
4935,“CHRISTUS!”,"Some voice sighed, “Christus!”"
4936,“CHRISTUS!”,
4937,“CHRISTUS!”,Burned on her cheek a sudden flame
4938,“CHRISTUS!”,"As her heart’s strong throbbings went and came,"
4939,“CHRISTUS!”,"And she stood alone on the lonely shore,"
4940,“CHRISTUS!”,Gazing the wide black waters o’er.
4941,“CHRISTUS!”,"“Whether it comes from heaven or hell,"
4942,“CHRISTUS!”,This voice I have learned to know too well—
4943,“CHRISTUS!”,"Whether from lips alive or dead,"
4944,“CHRISTUS!”,"Or from the hovering air,” she said—"
4945,“CHRISTUS!”,"“Whether it comes from sea or land,"
4946,“CHRISTUS!”,I will not sleep till I understand
4947,“CHRISTUS!”,This cry of ‘Christus!’”
4948,“CHRISTUS!”,
4949,“CHRISTUS!”,“Christus! Christus!” Faint and slow
4950,“CHRISTUS!”,Rose the wail from the drifted snow
4951,“CHRISTUS!”,"Under a low-browed, beetling rock,"
4952,“CHRISTUS!”,Strong to withstand the whirlwind’s shock.
4953,“CHRISTUS!”,"There, in the heart of the snowy mound,"
4954,“CHRISTUS!”,The buried form of a man she found—
4955,“CHRISTUS!”,"A Spanish sailor, with beard of brown"
4956,“CHRISTUS!”,"Over his red scarf flowing down,"
4957,“CHRISTUS!”,And jewelled ears that were strange to see.
4958,“CHRISTUS!”,"She was bending over it, when—ah me!"
4959,“CHRISTUS!”,"The shrill cry, “Christus!”"
4960,“CHRISTUS!”,
4961,“CHRISTUS!”,Rang out as if from the stony lips
4962,“CHRISTUS!”,"Whence life had parted in drear eclipse,"
4963,“CHRISTUS!”,As if the soul of the dead man cried
4964,“CHRISTUS!”,Again unto Christ the Crucified.
4965,“CHRISTUS!”,"The rose had fled from her cheeks so red,"
4966,“CHRISTUS!”,"But still she knelt by his side and said,"
4967,“CHRISTUS!”,"Under her breath, “I must understand"
4968,“CHRISTUS!”,Whether from heaven or sea or land
4969,“CHRISTUS!”,"Comes that cry, ‘Christus!’”"
4970,“CHRISTUS!”,
4971,“CHRISTUS!”,She laid her hand on the pulseless breast!
4972,“CHRISTUS!”,What fluttered beneath the crimson vest?
4973,“CHRISTUS!”,"A bird with plumage of green and gold,"
4974,“CHRISTUS!”,"Nestling away from the piercing cold,"
4975,“CHRISTUS!”,Was folded close to the silent heart
4976,“CHRISTUS!”,From which it had felt the life depart;
4977,“CHRISTUS!”,"And when she held it against her cheek,"
4978,“CHRISTUS!”,As plainly as ever a bird could speak
4979,“CHRISTUS!”,"It sobbed out, ‘Christus!’”"
4980,“CHRISTUS!”,
4981,“CHRISTUS!”,"And evermore when the winds blew loud,"
4982,“CHRISTUS!”,"And the trees in the grasp of the storm were bowed,"
4983,“CHRISTUS!”,And the lowering wings of the tempest beat
4984,“CHRISTUS!”,"The drifting snow in the village-street,"
4985,“CHRISTUS!”,Just as its master in death had cried
4986,“CHRISTUS!”,"To Christ, the Holy, the Crucified,"
4987,“CHRISTUS!”,Pouring his soul in one wild word—
4988,“CHRISTUS!”,Pray God that the cry in heaven was heard!—
4989,“CHRISTUS!”,"The bird cried, “Christus!”"
4990,“CHRISTUS!”,
4991,“CHRISTUS!”,
4992,THE KISS,THE KISS
4993,THE KISS,
4994,THE KISS,"When you lay before me dead,"
4995,THE KISS,"In your pallid rest,"
4996,THE KISS,On those passive lips of thine
4997,THE KISS,Not one kiss I pressed!
4998,THE KISS,
4999,THE KISS,Did you wonder—looking down
5000,THE KISS,From some higher sphere—
5001,THE KISS,Knowing how we two had loved
5002,THE KISS,Many and many a year?
5003,THE KISS,
5004,THE KISS,Did you think me strange and cold
5005,THE KISS,"When I did not touch,"
5006,THE KISS,"Even with reverent finger-tips,"
5007,THE KISS,What I had loved so much?
5008,THE KISS,
5009,THE KISS,"Ah! when last you kissed me, dear,"
5010,THE KISS,Know you what you said?
5011,THE KISS,"“Take this last kiss, my beloved,"
5012,THE KISS,Soon shall I be dead!
5013,THE KISS,
5014,THE KISS,"Keep it for a solemn sign,"
5015,THE KISS,"Through our love’s long night,"
5016,THE KISS,Till you give it back again
5017,THE KISS,On some morning bright.”
5018,THE KISS,
5019,THE KISS,So I gave you no caress;
5020,THE KISS,"But, remembering this,"
5021,THE KISS,Warm upon my lips I keep
5022,THE KISS,Your last living kiss!
5023,THE KISS,
5024,THE KISS,
5025,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,WHAT SHE THOUGHT
5026,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,
5027,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Marion showed me her wedding-gown
5028,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"And her veil of gossamer lace to-night,"
5029,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,And the orange-blooms that to-morrow morn
5030,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Shall fade in her soft hair’s golden light.
5031,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,But Philip came to the open door:
5032,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"Like the heart of a wild-rose glowed her cheek,"
5033,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,And they wandered off through the garden-paths
5034,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,So blest that they did not care to speak.
5035,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,
5036,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,I wonder how it seems to be loved;
5037,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,To know you are fair in someone’s eyes;
5038,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,That upon someone your beauty dawns
5039,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Every day as a new surprise;
5040,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"To know that, whether you weep or smile,"
5041,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"Whether your mood be grave or gay,"
5042,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"Somebody thinks you, all the while,"
5043,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Sweeter than any flower of May.
5044,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,
5045,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,I wonder what it would be to love:
5046,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"That, I think, would be sweeter far,—"
5047,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,To know that one out of all the world
5048,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"Was lord of your life, your king, your star!"
5049,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,They talk of love’s sweet tumult and pain:
5050,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"I am not sure that I understand,"
5051,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Though—a thrill ran down to my finger-tips
5052,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Once when—somebody—touched my hand!
5053,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,
5054,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,I wonder what it would be to dream
5055,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Of a child that might one day be your own;
5056,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"Of the hidden springs of your life a part,"
5057,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"Flesh of your flesh, and bone of your bone."
5058,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Marion stooped one day to kiss
5059,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,A beggar’s babe with a tender grace;
5060,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"While some sweet thought, like a prophecy,"
5061,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Looked from her pure Madonna face.
5062,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,
5063,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,I wonder what it must be to think
5064,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"To-morrow will be your wedding-day,"
5065,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"And you, in the radiant sunset glow"
5066,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"Down fragrant flowery paths will stray,"
5067,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"As Marion does this blessed night,"
5068,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"With Philip, lost in a blissful dream."
5069,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Can she feel his heart through the silence beat?
5070,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Does he see her eyes in the starlight gleam?
5071,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,
5072,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"Questioning thus, my days go on;"
5073,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,But never an answer comes to me:
5074,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"All love’s mysteries, sweet as strange,"
5075,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Sealed away from my life must be.
5076,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"Yet still I dream, O heart of mine!"
5077,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,Of a beautiful city that lies afar;
5078,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,"And there, some time, I shall drop the mask,"
5079,WHAT SHE THOUGHT,And be shapely and fair as others are.

5131,TWO,"Ring soft and low, ring loud and clear,"
5132,TWO,Ye chiming bells that swing on high!
5133,TWO,Look! look! she comes! The air grows sweet
5134,TWO,"With the fragrant breath of the orange blooms,"
5135,TWO,And the flowers she treads beneath her feet
5136,TWO,Die in a flood of rare perfumes!
5137,TWO,
5138,TWO,She comes! she comes! The happy bells
5139,TWO,"With joyous clamor fill the air,"
5140,TWO,"While the great organ dies and swells,"
5141,TWO,Soaring to trembling heights of prayer!
5142,TWO,"Oh! rare are her robes of silken sheen,"
5143,TWO,And the pearls that gleam on her bosom’s snow;
5144,TWO,"But rarer the grace of her royal mien,"
5145,TWO,"Her hair’s fine gold, and her cheek’s young glow."
5146,TWO,
5147,TWO,"Dainty and fair as a folded rose,"
5148,TWO,"Fresh as a violet dewy sweet,"
5149,TWO,"Chaste as a lily, she hardly knows"
5150,TWO,That there are rough paths for other feet.
5151,TWO,For Love hath shielded her; Honor kept
5152,TWO,Watch beside her by night and day;
5153,TWO,"And Evil out from her sight hath crept,"
5154,TWO,Trailing its slow length far away.
5155,TWO,
5156,TWO,"Now in her perfect womanhood,"
5157,TWO,"In all the wealth of her matchless charms,"
5158,TWO,"Lovely and beautiful, pure and good,"

5166,TWO,"To the other side of the town, I pray,"
5167,TWO,"Ere the sun goes down in the darkening sea,"
5168,TWO,"And night falls around us, chill and gray."
5169,TWO,"In the dim church porch an hour ago,"
5170,TWO,We waited the bride’s fair face to see;
5171,TWO,"Now Life has a sadder sight to show,"
5172,TWO,A darker picture for you and me.
5173,TWO,
5174,TWO,No need to seek for the shadow here;
5175,TWO,There are shadows lurking everywhere;
5176,TWO,"These streets in the brightest day are drear,"
5177,TWO,And black as the blackness of despair.
5178,TWO,"But this is the house. Take heed, my friend,"
5179,TWO,"The stairs are rotten, the way is dim;"
5180,TWO,"And up the flights, as we still ascend,"
5181,TWO,Creep stealthy phantoms dark and grim.
5182,TWO,

5184,TWO,"Alone in this chill and ghostly room,"
5185,TWO,"A child—a woman—which is it, pray?—"
5186,TWO,Despairingly waits for the hour of doom!
5187,TWO,"Ah! as she wrings her hands so pale,"
5188,TWO,No gleam of a wedding ring you see;
5189,TWO,There is nothing to tell. You know the tale—
5190,TWO,God help her now in her misery!
5191,TWO,
5192,TWO,I dare not judge her. I only know
5193,TWO,"That love was to her a sin and a snare,"
5194,TWO,While to the bride of an hour ago
5195,TWO,It brought all blessings its hands could bear!
5196,TWO,I only know that to one it came
5197,TWO,"Laden with honor, and joy, and peace;"
5198,TWO,"Its gifts to the other were woe and shame,"
5199,TWO,And a burning pain that shall never cease!
5200,TWO,
5201,TWO,I only know that the soul of one
5202,TWO,Has been a pearl in a golden case;
5203,TWO,That of the other a pebble thrown
5204,TWO,"Idly down in a way-side place,"
5205,TWO,"Where all day long strange footsteps trod,"
5206,TWO,"And the bold, bright sun drank up the dew!"
5207,TWO,"Yet both were women. O righteous God,"
5208,TWO,Thou only canst judge between the two!

5397,EVENTIDE,
5398,EVENTIDE,"An ancient cabinet stands there,"
5399,EVENTIDE,"That came from beyond the seas,"
5400,EVENTIDE,With a breath of spicy odors
5401,EVENTIDE,Caught from the Indian breeze;
5402,EVENTIDE,And its fluted doors and moldings
5403,EVENTIDE,Are dark with mysteries.
5404,EVENTIDE,
5405,EVENTIDE,"There’s an old arm-chair in the corner,"
5406,EVENTIDE,Straight-backed and tall and quaint;
5407,EVENTIDE,Ah! many a generation—
5408,EVENTIDE,Sinner and sage and saint—
5409,EVENTIDE,It hath held in its ample bosom
5410,EVENTIDE,With murmur nor complaint!
5411,EVENTIDE,
5412,EVENTIDE,"In the glow of the fire-light playing,"
5413,EVENTIDE,"A tiny, blithesome pair,"
5414,EVENTIDE,With the music of their laughter
5415,EVENTIDE,Fill all the tranquil air—
5416,EVENTIDE,"A rosy, brown-eyed lassie,"
5417,EVENTIDE,A boy serenely fair.
5418,EVENTIDE,
5419,EVENTIDE,A woman sits in the shadow
5420,EVENTIDE,"Watching the children twain,"
5421,EVENTIDE,With a joy so deep and tender
5422,EVENTIDE,"It is near akin to pain,"
5423,EVENTIDE,And a smile and tear blend softly—
5424,EVENTIDE,Sunshine and April rain!
5425,EVENTIDE,
5426,EVENTIDE,Her heart keeps time to the rhythm
5427,EVENTIDE,"Of love’s unuttered prayer,"
5428,EVENTIDE,"As, with still hands lightly folded,"
5429,EVENTIDE,"She listens, unaware,"
5430,EVENTIDE,"Through all the children’s laughter,"
5431,EVENTIDE,For a footfall on the stair.
5432,EVENTIDE,
5433,EVENTIDE,I know the woman who sits there;
5434,EVENTIDE,"Time hath been kind to her,"
5435,EVENTIDE,And the years have brought her treasures
5436,EVENTIDE,Of frankincense and myrrh
5437,EVENTIDE,"Richer, perhaps, and rarer,"
5438,EVENTIDE,Than Life’s young roses were.
5439,EVENTIDE,
5440,EVENTIDE,But I doubt if ever her spirit
5441,EVENTIDE,"Hath known, or yet shall know,"
5442,EVENTIDE,"The bliss of a happier hour,"
5443,EVENTIDE,"As the swift years come and go,"
5444,EVENTIDE,Than this in the shadowy chamber
5445,EVENTIDE,Lit by the hearth-fire’s glow!

5653,KING IVAN’S OATH,"His knights were loyal, brave, and true,"

5688,KING IVAN’S OATH,After a kingly fashion—knew
5689,KING IVAN’S OATH,"She had a right his throne to share,"

5693,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Forgot his kingly crown, and then"
5694,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Loved, and made love, like other men!"
5695,KING IVAN’S OATH,
5696,KING IVAN’S OATH,There seemed no shadow near the throne;
5697,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Yet oft the great king walked alone,"
5698,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Hands clasped behind him, head bowed down,"
5699,KING IVAN’S OATH,And on his royal face a frown.

5701,KING IVAN’S OATH,What scoffing spectre mocked his state?
5702,KING IVAN’S OATH,What demon held him in a spell?

5712,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Flower of the state, and pride of all—"
5713,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Grew at the king’s side, straight and tall!"
5714,KING IVAN’S OATH,
5715,KING IVAN’S OATH,The king was angered. It may be
5716,KING IVAN’S OATH,No worse than other men was he;
5717,KING IVAN’S OATH,But—a high tower upon a hill—
5718,KING IVAN’S OATH,His light shone far for good or ill!
5719,KING IVAN’S OATH,In from the chase one day he rode;
5720,KING IVAN’S OATH,To the queen’s chamber fierce he strode;
5721,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Where bending o’er her ’broidery frame,"
5722,KING IVAN’S OATH,Her pale cheeks burned with sudden flame
5723,KING IVAN’S OATH,"At his quick coming. Up she rose,"
5724,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Stirred from her wonted calm repose,"
5725,KING IVAN’S OATH,A lily flushing when the sun
5726,KING IVAN’S OATH,Its stately beauty looked upon!
5727,KING IVAN’S OATH,Alas! alas! so blind was he—
5728,KING IVAN’S OATH,Or else he did not care to see—
5729,KING IVAN’S OATH,"He had no pity, though she stood"
5730,KING IVAN’S OATH,In perfect flower of womanhood!
5731,KING IVAN’S OATH,"“You bear to me no son,” he said;"
5732,KING IVAN’S OATH,Then flinging back his haughty head:
5733,KING IVAN’S OATH,"“Each base-born peasant has an heir,"
5734,KING IVAN’S OATH,"His name to keep, his crust to share,"
5735,KING IVAN’S OATH,While I—the king of this broad land—
5736,KING IVAN’S OATH,Have no son near my throne to stand!
5737,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Who, then, shall reign when I am dead?"
5738,KING IVAN’S OATH,Who wield the sceptre in my stead?
5739,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Inherit all my pride and power,"
5740,KING IVAN’S OATH,And wear my glory as his dower?
5741,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Give me a man-child, who shall be"
5742,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Lord of the realm, himself, and me!”"
5743,KING IVAN’S OATH,
5744,KING IVAN’S OATH,Then pallid lips made slow reply—
5745,KING IVAN’S OATH,“God ordereth. Not you nor I!”
5746,KING IVAN’S OATH,His brow flushed hot; a sudden clang
5747,KING IVAN’S OATH,"As of arms throughout the chamber rang,"
5748,KING IVAN’S OATH,"And turning on his heel, he threw"
5749,KING IVAN’S OATH,Back wrathful answer: “That may do

5757,KING IVAN’S OATH,"By all the immortal gods, I swear"
5758,KING IVAN’S OATH,"I ne’er will speak to it, nor break"
5759,KING IVAN’S OATH,My soul’s stern silence for Love’s sake!”
5760,KING IVAN’S OATH,
5761,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Then forth he fared and rode away,"
5762,KING IVAN’S OATH,Nor saw the queen again that day—
5763,KING IVAN’S OATH,"The hapless queen, who to the floor"
5764,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Sank prone and breathless, as the door"
5765,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Swung to behind him, and his tread"
5766,KING IVAN’S OATH,Down the long arches echoèd.
5767,KING IVAN’S OATH,In truth she was in sorry plight
5768,KING IVAN’S OATH,"When her maids found her late that night,"
5769,KING IVAN’S OATH,"The king learned that which spoiled his rest,"
5770,KING IVAN’S OATH,But kept the secret in his breast!
5771,KING IVAN’S OATH,
5772,KING IVAN’S OATH,*       *       *       *       *
5773,KING IVAN’S OATH,
5774,KING IVAN’S OATH,"At length, when months had duly sped,"
5775,KING IVAN’S OATH,"High streamed the banners overhead,"
5776,KING IVAN’S OATH,And all the bells rang out at morn
5777,KING IVAN’S OATH,In jubilant peals—a Prince was born!
5778,KING IVAN’S OATH,Now let the joyous music ring!
5779,KING IVAN’S OATH,Now let the merry minstrels sing!
5780,KING IVAN’S OATH,Now pour the wine and crown the feast
5781,KING IVAN’S OATH,With fruits and flowers of all the East!
5782,KING IVAN’S OATH,Now let the votive candles shine
5783,KING IVAN’S OATH,And garlands bloom on every shrine!
5784,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Now let the young, with flying feet"
5785,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Time to bewildering music beat,"
5786,KING IVAN’S OATH,And let the old their joys rehearse
5787,KING IVAN’S OATH,"In stirring tale, or flowing verse!"
5788,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Now fill with shouts the waiting air,"
5789,KING IVAN’S OATH,And scatter largess everywhere!
5790,KING IVAN’S OATH,
5791,KING IVAN’S OATH,Ah! who so happy as the king?
5792,KING IVAN’S OATH,Swift flew the hours on eager wing;
5793,KING IVAN’S OATH,"And the boy grew apace, until"
5794,KING IVAN’S OATH,"The second summer, sweet and still,"
5795,KING IVAN’S OATH,Dropped roses round him as he played
5796,KING IVAN’S OATH,Where arched the leafy colonnade.
5797,KING IVAN’S OATH,"How fair he was tongue cannot say,"
5798,KING IVAN’S OATH,But he was fairer than the day;
5799,KING IVAN’S OATH,And never princely coronet
5800,KING IVAN’S OATH,On brow of nobler mould was set;
5801,KING IVAN’S OATH,Nor ever did its jewels gleam
5802,KING IVAN’S OATH,Above an eye of brighter beam;
5803,KING IVAN’S OATH,"And never yet where sunshine falls,"
5804,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Flooding with light the cottage walls,"
5805,KING IVAN’S OATH,"’Mid hum of bee, or song of birds,"
5806,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Or tenderest breath of loving words,"
5807,KING IVAN’S OATH,Blossomed a sweeter child than he!
5808,KING IVAN’S OATH,"How the king joyed his strength to see,"
5809,KING IVAN’S OATH,Counting the weeks that flew so fast—
5810,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Each fuller, happier than the last!"
5811,KING IVAN’S OATH,Six months had passed since he could walk;
5812,KING IVAN’S OATH,Was it not time the prince should talk?
5813,KING IVAN’S OATH,Ah! baby words with tripping feet!
5814,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Ah! baby laughter, silver sweet!"
5815,KING IVAN’S OATH,
5816,KING IVAN’S OATH,At length within the palace rose
5817,KING IVAN’S OATH,Rumor so strange that friends and foes
5818,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Forgot their love, forgot their hate,"
5819,KING IVAN’S OATH,Pausing to croon and speculate.
5820,KING IVAN’S OATH,Vague whispers floated in the air;
5821,KING IVAN’S OATH,A hint of mystery here and there;
5822,KING IVAN’S OATH,"A sudden hush, a startled glance,"
5823,KING IVAN’S OATH,Quick silences and looks askance.
5824,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Thus day by day the wonder grew,"
5825,KING IVAN’S OATH,Till o’er the kingdom wide it flew.
5826,KING IVAN’S OATH,The prince—his father—what was this
5827,KING IVAN’S OATH,Strange tale so surely told amiss?
5828,KING IVAN’S OATH,The young prince dumb? Who dared to say
5829,KING IVAN’S OATH,That nature such a prank could play?
5830,KING IVAN’S OATH,"_Dumb to the king?_ In silence bound,"
5831,KING IVAN’S OATH,With voiceless lips that gave no sound
5832,KING IVAN’S OATH,"When the king questioned?—Yet, no lute,"
5833,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Nor chiming bell, nor silver flute,"
5834,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Nor lark’s song, high in ether hung,"
5835,KING IVAN’S OATH,Rang clearer than the prince’s tongue!
5836,KING IVAN’S OATH,
5837,KING IVAN’S OATH,The court physicians came and went;
5838,KING IVAN’S OATH,Learned men from all the continent
5839,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Gave wise opinions, talked of laws,"
5840,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Stroked their gray beards, nor found the cause."
5841,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Then bribes were tried, and threats. The child,"
5842,KING IVAN’S OATH,"As one bewildered, sighed and smiled,"
5843,KING IVAN’S OATH,"In a wild storm of weeping broke,"
5844,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Moved its red lips, but never spoke."
5845,KING IVAN’S OATH,
5846,KING IVAN’S OATH,The changeful years rolled on apace;
5847,KING IVAN’S OATH,The young prince wore a bearded face;
5848,KING IVAN’S OATH,The good queen died; the king grew gray;
5849,KING IVAN’S OATH,A generation passed away.
5850,KING IVAN’S OATH,Courtiers forgot to tell the tale;
5851,KING IVAN’S OATH,Gossip itself grew old and stale.
5852,KING IVAN’S OATH,"But never once, in all the years"
5853,KING IVAN’S OATH,"That bore such freight of joys and tears,"
5854,KING IVAN’S OATH,Was the spell broken: not one word
5855,KING IVAN’S OATH,From son to sire was ever heard.
5856,KING IVAN’S OATH,Mutely his father’s face he scanned—
5857,KING IVAN’S OATH,Mutely he clasped his agèd hand—
5858,KING IVAN’S OATH,Mutely he kissed him when at last
5859,KING IVAN’S OATH,To death’s long slumber forth he passed!
5860,KING IVAN’S OATH,"Come weal or woe, he could not break"
5861,KING IVAN’S OATH,The mystic silence for Love’s sake!

5880,AT DAWN,
5881,AT DAWN,"Ah, well! As the swift years come and go,"
5882,AT DAWN,It will not be long ere I shall lie
5883,AT DAWN,"Somewhere under a bit of turf,"
5884,AT DAWN,With my pale hands folded quietly.
5885,AT DAWN,
5886,AT DAWN,And then someone who has loved me well—

5889,AT DAWN,“She has been just so many years at rest”—
5890,AT DAWN,
5891,AT DAWN,"Then turn to the living loves again,"
5892,AT DAWN,"To the busy life, without, within,"

5952,WEAVING THE WEB,"As she stood by her loom in the rosy light,"
5953,WEAVING THE WEB,"And her young eyes, hopefully glad and clear,"
5954,WEAVING THE WEB,Followed afar the swallow’s flight.
5955,WEAVING THE WEB,"“As soon as the day’s first tasks are done,"
5956,WEAVING THE WEB,"While yet I am fresh and strong,” said she,"
5957,WEAVING THE WEB,“I will hasten to weave the beautiful web
5958,WEAVING THE WEB,Whose pattern is known to none but me!
5959,WEAVING THE WEB,
5960,WEAVING THE WEB,"I will weave it fine, I will weave it fair,"
5961,WEAVING THE WEB,And ah! how the colors will glow!” she said;
5962,WEAVING THE WEB,“So fadeless and strong will I weave my web
5963,WEAVING THE WEB,That perhaps it will live after I am dead.”
5964,WEAVING THE WEB,But the morning hours sped on apace;
5965,WEAVING THE WEB,The air grew sweet with the breath of June;
5966,WEAVING THE WEB,"And young Love hid by the waiting loom,"
5967,WEAVING THE WEB,Tangling the threads as he hummed a tune.
5968,WEAVING THE WEB,
5969,WEAVING THE WEB,"“Ah, life is so rich and full!” she cried,"
5970,WEAVING THE WEB,“And morn is short though the days are long!
5971,WEAVING THE WEB,"This noon I will weave my beautiful web,"
5972,WEAVING THE WEB,"I will weave it carefully, fine and strong.”"
5973,WEAVING THE WEB,But the sun rode high in the cloudless sky;
5974,WEAVING THE WEB,The burden and heat of the day she bore
5975,WEAVING THE WEB,"And hither and thither she came and went,"
5976,WEAVING THE WEB,While the loom stood still as it stood before.

5978,WEAVING THE WEB,"“Ah! life is too busy at noon,” she said;"

5981,WEAVING THE WEB,And my heart grows calm in the silence wide.”
5982,WEAVING THE WEB,"So, one by one, the hours passed on"
5983,WEAVING THE WEB,Till the creeping shadows had longer grown;
5984,WEAVING THE WEB,"Till the house was still, and the breezes slept,"
5985,WEAVING THE WEB,And her singing birds to their nests had flown.

5987,WEAVING THE WEB,"“And now I will weave my web,” she said,"

5991,WEAVING THE WEB,"But hand was tired, and heart was weak:"
5992,WEAVING THE WEB,"“I am not as strong as I was,” sighed she,"
5993,WEAVING THE WEB,"“And the pattern is blurred, and the colors rare"

5999,WEAVING THE WEB,As lower and lower sank the sun.
6000,WEAVING THE WEB,She dropped the shuttle; the loom stood still;
6001,WEAVING THE WEB,The weaver slept in the twilight gray.

6029,RABBI BENAIAH,Homeward across the desert bent his way.
6030,RABBI BENAIAH,

6032,RABBI BENAIAH,"The slow, weird camels, with monotonous pace;"
6033,RABBI BENAIAH,"Before him, lifted in the clear, far space,"
6034,RABBI BENAIAH,From east to west the towers of his city ran!
6035,RABBI BENAIAH,
6036,RABBI BENAIAH,Impatiently he scanned the darkening sky;
6037,RABBI BENAIAH,"Then girding in hot haste, “What ho!” cried he,"

6039,RABBI BENAIAH,"As rode his Bedouin master, so will I!”"
6040,RABBI BENAIAH,

6044,RABBI BENAIAH,"He paused a moment, slowly entering through."
6045,RABBI BENAIAH,
6046,RABBI BENAIAH,"Then down the shadowy, moonlit streets he sped;"
6047,RABBI BENAIAH,"The city slept; but like a burning star,"

6057,RABBI BENAIAH,"With trembling lips that hardly breathed his name,"
6058,RABBI BENAIAH,"And sad, averted eyes, his fair wife came—"
6059,RABBI BENAIAH,The lady Judith—wan with tears and prayers.
6060,RABBI BENAIAH,

6099,RABBI BENAIAH,Seen from afar had blessed the rabbi’s sight.

6166,“GOD KNOWS”,Wild and dark was the winter night
6167,“GOD KNOWS”,"When the emigrant ship went down,"
6168,“GOD KNOWS”,"But just outside of the harbor bar,"
6169,“GOD KNOWS”,In the sight of the startled town.
6170,“GOD KNOWS”,"The winds howled, and the sea roared,"
6171,“GOD KNOWS”,"And never a soul could sleep,"
6172,“GOD KNOWS”,"Save the little ones on their mothers’ breasts,"

6178,“GOD KNOWS”,There was many a ready hand—
6179,“GOD KNOWS”,"Women who prayed, and men who strove"
6180,“GOD KNOWS”,When prayers and work were vain;
6181,“GOD KNOWS”,For the sun rose over the awful void
6182,“GOD KNOWS”,And the silence of the main.
6183,“GOD KNOWS”,
6184,“GOD KNOWS”,"All day the watchers paced the sands,"
6185,“GOD KNOWS”,"All day they scanned the deep,"
6186,“GOD KNOWS”,All night the booming minute-guns
6187,“GOD KNOWS”,Echoed from steep to steep.
6188,“GOD KNOWS”,"“Give up thy dead, O cruel sea!”"
6189,“GOD KNOWS”,They cried athwart the space;
6190,“GOD KNOWS”,But only an infant’s fragile form
6191,“GOD KNOWS”,Escaped from its stern embrace.
6192,“GOD KNOWS”,
6193,“GOD KNOWS”,Only one little child of all
6194,“GOD KNOWS”,Who with the ship went down
6195,“GOD KNOWS”,That night when the happy babies slept
6196,“GOD KNOWS”,So warm in the sheltered town.
6197,“GOD KNOWS”,"Wrapped in the glow of the morning light,"
6198,“GOD KNOWS”,"It lay on the shifting sand,"
6199,“GOD KNOWS”,"As fair as a sculptor’s marble dream,"
6200,“GOD KNOWS”,With a shell in its dimpled hand.
6201,“GOD KNOWS”,
6202,“GOD KNOWS”,There were none to tell of its race or kin.
6203,“GOD KNOWS”,"“God knoweth,” the pastor said,"
6204,“GOD KNOWS”,When the wondering children asked of him
6205,“GOD KNOWS”,The name of the baby dead.
6206,“GOD KNOWS”,"And so, when they laid it away at last"
6207,“GOD KNOWS”,"In the church-yard’s hushed repose,"

6212,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD
6213,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6214,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,Only a glimpse of mountain road
6215,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,That followed where a river flowed;
6216,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,Only a glimpse—then on we passed
6217,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,Skirting the forest dim and vast.
6218,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6219,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,I closed my eyes. On rushed the train
6220,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"Into the dark, then out again,"
6221,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,Startling the song-birds as it flew
6222,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,The wild ravines and gorges through.
6223,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6224,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"But, heeding not the dangerous way"
6225,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"O’erhung by sheer cliffs, rough and gray,"
6226,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"I only saw, as in a dream,"
6227,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,The road beside the mountain stream.
6228,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6229,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"No smoke curled upward in the air,"
6230,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,No meadow-lands stretched broad and fair;
6231,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"But towering peaks rose far and high,"
6232,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"Piercing the clear, untroubled sky."
6233,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6234,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"Yet down the yellow, winding road"
6235,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"That followed where the river flowed,"
6236,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,I saw a long procession pass
6237,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,As shadows over bending grass.
6238,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6239,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"The young, the old, the sad, the gay,"
6240,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"Whose feet had worn that narrow way,"
6241,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,Since first within the dusky glade
6242,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,Some Indian lover wooed his maid;
6243,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6244,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,Or silent crept from tree to tree—
6245,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"Spirit of stealthy vengeance, he!"
6246,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,Or breathless crouched while through the brake
6247,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,The wild deer stole his thirst to slake.
6248,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6249,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"The barefoot school-boys rushing out,"
6250,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"An eager, crowding, roisterous rout;"
6251,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,The sturdy lads; the lassies gay
6252,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,As bobolinks in merry May;
6253,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6254,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,The farmer whistling to his team
6255,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,When first the dawn begins to gleam;
6256,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,The loaded wains that one by one
6257,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,Drag slowly home at set of sun;
6258,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6259,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,Young lovers straying hand in hand
6260,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"Within a fair, enchanted land;"
6261,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,And many a bride with lingering feet;
6262,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,And many a matron calm and sweet;
6263,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6264,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,And many an old man bent with pain;
6265,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,And many a solemn funeral train;
6266,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"And sometimes, red against the sky,"
6267,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,An army’s banners waving high!
6268,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,
6269,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,All mysteries of life and death
6270,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"To which the spirit answereth,"
6271,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,"Are thine, O lonely mountain road,"
6272,THE MOUNTAIN ROAD,That followed where the river flowed!

6276,ENTERING IN,
6277,ENTERING IN,The church was dim and silent
6278,ENTERING IN,"With the hush before the prayer,"
6279,ENTERING IN,Only the solemn trembling
6280,ENTERING IN,Of the organ stirred the air;
6281,ENTERING IN,"Without, the sweet, still sunshine;"
6282,ENTERING IN,"Within, the holy calm"
6283,ENTERING IN,Where priest and people waited
6284,ENTERING IN,For the swelling of the psalm.
6285,ENTERING IN,
6286,ENTERING IN,"Slowly the door swung open,"
6287,ENTERING IN,"And a trembling baby girl,"
6288,ENTERING IN,"Brown-eyed, with brown hair falling"
6289,ENTERING IN,"In many a wavy curl,"
6290,ENTERING IN,"With soft cheeks flushing hotly,"
6291,ENTERING IN,"Shy glances downward thrown,"
6292,ENTERING IN,"And small hands clasped before her,"
6293,ENTERING IN,Stood in the aisle alone.
6294,ENTERING IN,
6295,ENTERING IN,"Stood half abashed, half frightened,"
6296,ENTERING IN,"Unknowing where to go,"
6297,ENTERING IN,"While like a wind-rocked flower,"
6298,ENTERING IN,"Her form swayed to and fro,"
6299,ENTERING IN,And the changing color fluttered
6300,ENTERING IN,"In the little troubled face,"
6301,ENTERING IN,As from side to side she wavered
6302,ENTERING IN,"With a mute, imploring grace."
6303,ENTERING IN,
6304,ENTERING IN,It was but for a moment;
6305,ENTERING IN,"What wonder that we smiled,"
6306,ENTERING IN,"By such a strange, sweet picture"
6307,ENTERING IN,From holy thoughts beguiled?
6308,ENTERING IN,Then up rose someone softly:
6309,ENTERING IN,"And many an eye grew dim,"
6310,ENTERING IN,As through the tender silence
6311,ENTERING IN,He bore the child with him.
6312,ENTERING IN,
6313,ENTERING IN,And I—I wondered (losing
6314,ENTERING IN,The sermon and the prayer)
6315,ENTERING IN,If when sometime I enter
6316,ENTERING IN,"The “many mansions” fair,"
6317,ENTERING IN,"And stand, abashed and drooping,"
6318,ENTERING IN,"In the portal’s golden glow,"
6319,ENTERING IN,Our God will send an angel

6329,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,
6330,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"She has been your wife for many a year,"
6331,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,When clouds hung low and when skies were clear;
6332,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"At your feet she laid her life’s glad spring,"
6333,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,And her summer’s glorious blossoming.
6334,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,
6335,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,Her whole heart went with the hand you won;

6346,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,Like a rose in the summer? Do you know?
6347,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,Does a lily grow when its leaves are chilled?
6348,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,Does it bloom when its root is winter-killed?
6349,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,
6350,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"For a little while, when you first were wed,"
6351,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,Your love was like sunshine round her shed;
6352,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"Then a something crept between you two,"
6353,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,You led where she could not follow you.
6354,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,
6355,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,With a man’s firm tread you went and came;
6356,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"You lived for wealth, for power, for fame;"
6357,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"Shut in to her woman’s work and ways,"
6358,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,She heard the nation chant your praise.
6359,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,
6360,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,But ah! you had dropped her hand the while;
6361,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"What time had you for a kiss, a smile?"
6362,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"You two, with the same roof overhead,"
6363,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,Were as far apart as the sundered dead!
6364,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,

6366,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"She, worn and faded before her time."
6367,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"’Tis a common story. This rose, you say,"
6368,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,You laid in her pallid hand to-day?
6369,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,
6370,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,When did you give her a flower before?
6371,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"Ah, well!—what matter when all is o’er?"
6372,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,Yet stay a moment; you’ll wed again.
6373,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,I mean no reproach; ’tis the way of men.
6374,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,
6375,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,But I pray you think when some fairer face
6376,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,"Shines like a star from her wonted place,"
6377,A FLOWER FOR THE DEAD,That love will starve if it is not fed;

6607,THE DIFFERENCE,
6608,THE DIFFERENCE,Or art thou near us? There are those who say
6609,THE DIFFERENCE,That but a breath divides our world from thine;
6610,THE DIFFERENCE,A little cloud that may be blown away—
6611,THE DIFFERENCE,A gossamer veil than spider’s web more fine.
6612,THE DIFFERENCE,

6657,MY BIRTHDAY,To think that we who are now so dear
6658,MY BIRTHDAY,"Were once in our dreams so far apart,"
6659,MY BIRTHDAY,Nor cared if the other were far or near!
6660,MY BIRTHDAY,
6661,MY BIRTHDAY,But—how old am I? You must tell.

6694,A RED ROSE,"Thy lover, the lordly Sun?"
6695,A RED ROSE,Didst thou see him sink in the glowing west
6696,A RED ROSE,With pomp of banners above his rest?

6744,TWENTY-ONE,I cannot save them from earth’s pain or loss;

8111,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,From fairy-haunted dells
8112,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Among the lonely fells;
8113,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,From banks where wild thyme grows
8114,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,And the blue violet blows;
8115,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"From caverns grim, and caves"
8116,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Lashed by the deep sea-waves;
8117,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"From darkling forest shade,"
8118,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"From busy haunts of trade,"
8119,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"From market, court, and camp,"
8120,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Where folly rings her bells,"
8121,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Or sorrow tolls her knells,"
8122,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Or where in cloister cells
8123,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,The scholar trims his lamp—
8124,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Wearing the sword, the gown,"
8125,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"The motley of the clown,"
8126,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"The beggar’s rags, the dole"
8127,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Of the remorseful soul,"
8128,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"The wedding-robe, the ring,"

8130,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"O myriad-minded man,"
8131,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Thus thine immortal clan
8132,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Passed down the endless ways
8133,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Of the eternal days!
8134,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,
8135,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Then said I to my spirit:

8137,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Well the king’s sons may inherit
8138,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,All his glory and renown.
8139,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Where are they—the songs unsung
8140,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,By the humbler bards whose lyres
8141,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Through earth’s lowly vales have rung,"
8142,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Like the notes of woodland choirs?
8143,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,They whose silver-sandalled feet
8144,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Never climbed the clouds to meet?”
8145,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,
8146,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Where?—The air grew full of laughter
8147,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Low and sweet, and following after"
8148,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Came the softest breath of singing
8149,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,As if lily bells were ringing;
8150,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"And from all the happy closes,"
8151,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Crowned with daisies, crowned with roses,"
8152,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Bearing woodland ferns for palm-boughs in their hands,"
8153,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"From the dim secluded places,"
8154,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Through the wide enchanted spaces,"
8155,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,With their song-illumined faces
8156,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Swept the shadowy minstrel bands!
8157,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,
8158,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Songs unsung, the high and lowly,"
8159,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Songs, the holy and unholy,"
8160,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,In that purest air grown wholly
8161,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Clean from every spot and stain!
8162,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,And I knew as endless ages
8163,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Still were turning life’s full pages,"
8164,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,Each should find his own again—
8165,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,"Find the song he could not sing,"
8166,A DREAM OF SONGS UNSUNG,As his soul’s best blossoming!

8217,THE FALLOW FIELD,
8218,THE FALLOW FIELD,The sun comes up and the sun goes down;
8219,THE FALLOW FIELD,The night mist shroudeth the sleeping town;
8220,THE FALLOW FIELD,"But if it be dark or if it be day,"
8221,THE FALLOW FIELD,"If the tempests beat or the breezes play,"
8222,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Still here on this upland slope I lie,"
8223,THE FALLOW FIELD,Looking up to the changeful sky.
8224,THE FALLOW FIELD,
8225,THE FALLOW FIELD,Naught am I but a fallow field;
8226,THE FALLOW FIELD,Never a crop my acres yield.
8227,THE FALLOW FIELD,Over the wall at my right hand
8228,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Stately and green the corn-blades stand,"
8229,THE FALLOW FIELD,And I hear at my left the flying feet
8230,THE FALLOW FIELD,Of the winds that rustle the bending wheat.
8231,THE FALLOW FIELD,
8232,THE FALLOW FIELD,Often while yet the morn is red
8233,THE FALLOW FIELD,I list for our master’s eager tread.
8234,THE FALLOW FIELD,"He smiles at the young corn’s towering height,"
8235,THE FALLOW FIELD,"He knows the wheat is a goodly sight,"
8236,THE FALLOW FIELD,But he glances not at the fallow field
8237,THE FALLOW FIELD,Whose idle acres no wealth may yield.
8238,THE FALLOW FIELD,
8239,THE FALLOW FIELD,Sometimes the shout of the harvesters
8240,THE FALLOW FIELD,"The sleeping pulse of my being stirs,"
8241,THE FALLOW FIELD,And as one in a dream I seem to feel
8242,THE FALLOW FIELD,"The sweep and the rush of the swinging steel,"
8243,THE FALLOW FIELD,Or I catch the sound of the gay refrain
8244,THE FALLOW FIELD,As they heap their wains with the golden grain.
8245,THE FALLOW FIELD,
8246,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Yet, O my neighbors, be not too proud,"
8247,THE FALLOW FIELD,Though on every tongue your praise is loud.
8248,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Our mother Nature is kind to me,"
8249,THE FALLOW FIELD,"And I am beloved by bird and bee,"
8250,THE FALLOW FIELD,And never a child that passes by
8251,THE FALLOW FIELD,But turns upon me a grateful eye.
8252,THE FALLOW FIELD,
8253,THE FALLOW FIELD,Over my head the skies are blue;
8254,THE FALLOW FIELD,I have my share of the rain and dew;
8255,THE FALLOW FIELD,I bask like you in the summer sun
8256,THE FALLOW FIELD,"When the long bright days pass, one by one,"
8257,THE FALLOW FIELD,And calm as yours is my sweet repose
8258,THE FALLOW FIELD,Wrapped in the warmth of the winter snows.
8259,THE FALLOW FIELD,
8260,THE FALLOW FIELD,For little our loving mother cares
8261,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Which the corn or the daisy bears,"
8262,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Which is rich with the ripening wheat,"
8263,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Which with the violet’s breath is sweet,"
8264,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Which is red with the clover bloom,"
8265,THE FALLOW FIELD,Or which for the wild sweet-fern makes room.
8266,THE FALLOW FIELD,
8267,THE FALLOW FIELD,Useless under the summer sky
8268,THE FALLOW FIELD,Year after year men say I lie.
8269,THE FALLOW FIELD,Little they know what strength of mine
8270,THE FALLOW FIELD,I give to the trailing blackberry vine;
8271,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Little they know how the wild grape grows,"
8272,THE FALLOW FIELD,Or how my life-blood flushes the rose.
8273,THE FALLOW FIELD,
8274,THE FALLOW FIELD,Little they think of the cups I fill
8275,THE FALLOW FIELD,For the mosses creeping under the hill;
8276,THE FALLOW FIELD,Little they think of the feast I spread
8277,THE FALLOW FIELD,For the wild wee creatures that must be fed:
8278,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Squirrel and butterfly, bird and bee,"
8279,THE FALLOW FIELD,And the creeping things that no eye may see.
8280,THE FALLOW FIELD,
8281,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Lord of the harvest, thou dost know"
8282,THE FALLOW FIELD,How the summers and winters go.
8283,THE FALLOW FIELD,Never a ship sails east or west
8284,THE FALLOW FIELD,"Laden with treasures at my behest,"
8285,THE FALLOW FIELD,Yet my being thrills to the voice of God
8286,THE FALLOW FIELD,When I give my gold to the golden-rod.

8614,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8615,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"One autumn day we three,"
8616,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Who long had borne each other company—
8617,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Grief, and my Heart, and I—"
8618,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Walked out beneath a dull and leaden sky.
8619,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8620,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,The fields were bare and brown;
8621,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,From the still trees the dead leaves fluttered down;
8622,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"There were no birds to sing,"
8623,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Or cleave the air on swift, rejoicing wing."
8624,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8625,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,We sought the barren sand
8626,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Beside the moaning sea, and, hand in hand,"
8627,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Paced its slow length, and talked"
8628,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Of our supremest sorrows as we walked.
8629,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8630,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Slow shaking each bowed head,"
8631,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"“There is no anguish like to ours,” we said;"
8632,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,“The glancing eyes of morn
8633,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Fall on no souls more utterly forlorn.”
8634,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8635,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"But suddenly, across"
8636,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"A narrow fiord wherein wild billows toss,"
8637,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"We saw before our eyes,"
8638,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"High hung above the tide, a temple rise—"
8639,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8640,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"A temple wondrous fair,"
8641,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Lifting its shining turrets in the air,"
8642,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"All touched with golden gleams,"
8643,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Like the bright miracles we see in dreams.
8644,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8645,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Grief turned and looked at me.
8646,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"“We must go thither, O my friends,” said she;"
8647,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Then, saying nothing more,"
8648,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"With rapid, gliding step passed on before."
8649,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8650,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,And we—my Heart and I—
8651,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Where Grief went, we went, following silently,"
8652,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Till in sweet solitude
8653,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Beneath the temple’s vaulted roof we stood.
8654,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8655,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,’Twas like a hollow pearl—
8656,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"A vast white sacred chamber, where the whirl"
8657,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Of passion stirred not, where"
8658,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,A luminous splendor trembled in the air.
8659,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8660,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"“O friends, I know this place,”"
8661,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Said Grief at last, “this lofty, silent space,"
8662,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Where, either soon or late,"
8663,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,I and my kindred all shall lie in state.”
8664,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8665,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,“But do Griefs die?” I cried.
8666,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"“Some die—not all,” full calmly she replied."
8667,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,“Yet all at last will lie
8668,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"In this fair chamber, slumbering quietly."
8669,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8670,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Chamber of Silence, this;"
8671,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Who brings his Grief here doth not go amiss.
8672,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Mine hour hath come. We three
8673,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Will walk, O friends, no more in company.”"
8674,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8675,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Then was I dumb. My Heart
8676,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"And I—how could we with our dear Grief part,"
8677,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Who for so many a day
8678,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Had walked beside us in our lonely way?
8679,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8680,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"But she, with matchless grace,"
8681,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"And a sweet smile upon her tear-wet face,"
8682,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Said, “Leave me here to sleep,"
8683,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Where every Grief forgets at last to weep.”
8684,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8685,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,What could we do but go?
8686,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"We turned with slow, reluctant feet, but lo!"
8687,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"The pearly door had closed,"
8688,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Shutting us in where all the Griefs reposed.
8689,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8690,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"“Nay, go not back,” she said;"
8691,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,“Retrace no steps. Go farther on instead.”
8692,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Then, on the other side,"
8693,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"On noiseless hinge another door swung wide,"
8694,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8695,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Through which we onward passed
8696,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"Into a chamber lowlier than the last,"
8697,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,"But, oh! so sweet and calm"
8698,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,That the hushed air was like a holy psalm.
8699,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,
8700,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,“Chamber of Peace” was writ
8701,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Where the low vaulted roof arched over it.
8702,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,Then knew we Grief must cease
8703,THE CHAMBER OF SILENCE,When sacred Silence leadeth unto Peace.

8792,VALDEMAR,"Within a city quaint and old,"
8793,VALDEMAR,"When reigned King Alcinor the Bold,"
8794,VALDEMAR,There dwelt a sculptor whose renown
8795,VALDEMAR,With pride and wonder filled the town.
8796,VALDEMAR,And yet he had not reached his prime;
8797,VALDEMAR,The first warm glow of summer-time
8798,VALDEMAR,"Had but just touched his radiant face,"
8799,VALDEMAR,And moulded to a statelier grace
8800,VALDEMAR,The stalwart form that trod the earth
8801,VALDEMAR,As it had been of princely birth.
8802,VALDEMAR,"So fair, so strong, so brave was he,"
8803,VALDEMAR,"With such a sense of mastery,"
8804,VALDEMAR,That Alcinor upon his throne
8805,VALDEMAR,No kinglier gifts from life could own
8806,VALDEMAR,Than those it brought from near and far
8807,VALDEMAR,"To the young sculptor, Valdemar!"
8808,VALDEMAR,"Mayhap he was not rich—for Fame,"
8809,VALDEMAR,"To lend its magic to his name,"
8810,VALDEMAR,Had outrun Fortune’s swiftest pace
8811,VALDEMAR,And conquered in the friendly race.
8812,VALDEMAR,"But a fair home was his, where bees"
8813,VALDEMAR,Hummed in the laden mulberry-trees;
8814,VALDEMAR,"Where cyclamens, with rosy flush,"
8815,VALDEMAR,"Brightened the lingering twilight hush,"
8816,VALDEMAR,And the gladiolus’ fiery plume
8817,VALDEMAR,Mocked the red rose’s brilliant bloom;
8818,VALDEMAR,Where violet and wind-flower hid
8819,VALDEMAR,The acacia’s golden gloom amid;
8820,VALDEMAR,"Where starry jasmines climbed, and where,"
8821,VALDEMAR,"Serenely calm, divinely fair,"
8822,VALDEMAR,"Like a white lily, straight and tall,"
8823,VALDEMAR,"The loveliest flower among them all,"
8824,VALDEMAR,"His sweet young wife, Hermione,"
8825,VALDEMAR,Sang to the child upon her knee!
8826,VALDEMAR,
8827,VALDEMAR,"Here beauteous visions haunted him,"
8828,VALDEMAR,Peopling the shadows soft and dim;
8829,VALDEMAR,Here the old gods around him cast
8830,VALDEMAR,The glamour of their splendors past.
8831,VALDEMAR,Jove thundered from the awful sky;
8832,VALDEMAR,Proud Juno trod the earth once more;
8833,VALDEMAR,"Pale Isis, veiled in mystery,"
8834,VALDEMAR,Her smile of mystic meaning wore;
8835,VALDEMAR,"Apollo joyed in youth divine,"
8836,VALDEMAR,And Bacchus wreathed the fragrant vine.
8837,VALDEMAR,"Here chaste Diana, crescent-crowned,"
8838,VALDEMAR,With virgin footsteps spurned the ground;
8839,VALDEMAR,"Here rose fair Venus from the sea,"
8840,VALDEMAR,"And that sad ghost, Persephone,"
8841,VALDEMAR,"Wandered, a very shade of shades,"
8842,VALDEMAR,Amid the moonlit myrtle glades.
8843,VALDEMAR,"Nor they alone. The Heavenly Child,"
8844,VALDEMAR,"The Holy Mother, meek and mild,"
8845,VALDEMAR,"Angels on glad wing soaring free,"
8846,VALDEMAR,"Pale, praying saints on bended knee,"
8847,VALDEMAR,"Martyrs with palms, and heroes brave"
8848,VALDEMAR,"Who for their guerdon won a grave,"
8849,VALDEMAR,"Earth’s laughing children, rosy sweet,"
8850,VALDEMAR,"And the soul’s phantoms, fair and fleet—"
8851,VALDEMAR,"All these were with him night and day,"
8852,VALDEMAR,Charming the happy hours away!
8853,VALDEMAR,"Oh, who so rich as Valdemar?"
8854,VALDEMAR,What ill his joyous life can mar?
8855,VALDEMAR,"With home and glorious visions blest,"
8856,VALDEMAR,Glad in the work he loveth best!
8857,VALDEMAR,
8858,VALDEMAR,But Love’s clear eyes are quick to see;
8859,VALDEMAR,"And one fair spring, Hermione."
8860,VALDEMAR,Sitting beneath her mulberry-tree
8861,VALDEMAR,"With her young children at her knee,"
8862,VALDEMAR,"Saw Valdemar from day to day,"
8863,VALDEMAR,"As one whose thoughts were far away,"
8864,VALDEMAR,With folded arms and drooping head
8865,VALDEMAR,Pace the green aisles with silent tread;
8866,VALDEMAR,Saw him stand moodily apart
8867,VALDEMAR,"With idle hands and brooding heart,"
8868,VALDEMAR,"Or gaze at his still forms of clay,"
8869,VALDEMAR,Himself as motionless as they!
8870,VALDEMAR,"“O Valdemar!” she cried, “you bear"
8871,VALDEMAR,Some burden that I do not share!
8872,VALDEMAR,"I am your wife, your own true wife;"
8873,VALDEMAR,Shut me not out from heart and life!
8874,VALDEMAR,Why brood you thus in silent pain?”
8875,VALDEMAR,"As shifts the changing weather-vane,"
8876,VALDEMAR,"So came the old smile to his face,"
8877,VALDEMAR,Saluting her with courtly grace.
8878,VALDEMAR,"“Nay, nay, Hermione, not so!"
8879,VALDEMAR,"No secret, bitter grief I know;"
8880,VALDEMAR,"But, haunting all my dreams by night"
8881,VALDEMAR,"And thoughts by day, one vision bright,"
8882,VALDEMAR,"One nameless wonder, near me stands,"
8883,VALDEMAR,Claiming its birthright at my hands.
8884,VALDEMAR,"It hath your eyes, Hermione,"
8885,VALDEMAR,Your tender lips that smile for me;
8886,VALDEMAR,"It hath your perfect, stately grace,"
8887,VALDEMAR,The matchless beauty of your face.
8888,VALDEMAR,But it hath more! for never yet
8889,VALDEMAR,On brow of earthly mould was set
8890,VALDEMAR,Such splendor and such light as streams
8891,VALDEMAR,From this rare phantom of my dreams!”
8892,VALDEMAR,
8893,VALDEMAR,"Lightly she turned, and led him through"
8894,VALDEMAR,"Under the jasmines wet with dew,"
8895,VALDEMAR,"Into a wide, cool room, shut in"
8896,VALDEMAR,From the great city’s whirl and din—
8897,VALDEMAR,"Then, smiling, touched a heap of clay."
8898,VALDEMAR,"“Dear idler, do thy work, I pray!"
8899,VALDEMAR,Thy radiant phantom lieth hid
8900,VALDEMAR,"The mould of centuries amid,"
8901,VALDEMAR,Waiting till thou shalt bid it rise
8902,VALDEMAR,And live beneath the wondering skies!”
8903,VALDEMAR,
8904,VALDEMAR,Then rose a hot flush to his cheek;
8905,VALDEMAR,His stammering lips were slow to speak.
8906,VALDEMAR,"“Hermione,” he said at length,"
8907,VALDEMAR,"As one who gathers up his strength,"
8908,VALDEMAR,"“Hermione, my wife, I go"
8909,VALDEMAR,Far from thee on a journey slow
8910,VALDEMAR,And long and perilous; for I know
8911,VALDEMAR,Somewhere upon the earth there is
8912,VALDEMAR,"A finer, purer clay than this,"
8913,VALDEMAR,From which I’ll mould a shape more fair
8914,VALDEMAR,Than ever breathed in earthly air!
8915,VALDEMAR,I go to seek it!”
8916,VALDEMAR,
8917,VALDEMAR,"“Ah!” she said,"
8918,VALDEMAR,"With smiling lips, but tearful eyes,"
8919,VALDEMAR,"Half lifted in a grieved surprise,"
8920,VALDEMAR,“How shall I then be comforted?
8921,VALDEMAR,Not always do we find afar
8922,VALDEMAR,"The good we seek, my Valdemar!"
8923,VALDEMAR,"This common, way-side clay thy hand"
8924,VALDEMAR,Hath been most potent to command.
8925,VALDEMAR,Yet I—I will not bid thee stay.
8926,VALDEMAR,"Go, if thou must, and find thy clay!”"
8927,VALDEMAR,
8928,VALDEMAR,"Then his long journeyings began,"
8929,VALDEMAR,And still his hope his steps outran.
8930,VALDEMAR,O’er desert sands he came and went;
8931,VALDEMAR,He crossed a mighty continent;
8932,VALDEMAR,Plunged into forests dark and lone;
8933,VALDEMAR,In jungles heard the panther’s moan;
8934,VALDEMAR,Climbed the far mountains’ lofty heights;
8935,VALDEMAR,Watched alien stars through weary nights;
8936,VALDEMAR,"While more than once, on trackless seas,"
8937,VALDEMAR,His white sails caught the eddying breeze.
8938,VALDEMAR,"Yet all his labor was for nought,"
8939,VALDEMAR,"And never found he what he sought,"
8940,VALDEMAR,Or far or near. The finer clay
8941,VALDEMAR,But mocked his eager search alway.
8942,VALDEMAR,
8943,VALDEMAR,"Ofttimes he came, with weary feet,"
8944,VALDEMAR,Back to the home so still and sweet
8945,VALDEMAR,"Where his fair wife, Hermione,"
8946,VALDEMAR,Dwelt with her children at her knee;
8947,VALDEMAR,But never once his eager hand
8948,VALDEMAR,Thrilled the mute clay with high command.
8949,VALDEMAR,"One day she spoke: “O Valdemar,"
8950,VALDEMAR,Cease from your wanderings wide and far!
8951,VALDEMAR,"Life is not long. Why waste it, then,"
8952,VALDEMAR,Chasing false fires through marsh and fen?
8953,VALDEMAR,Mould your fair statue while you may;
8954,VALDEMAR,High purpose sanctifies the clay.”
8955,VALDEMAR,
8956,VALDEMAR,"He answered her, “My dream must wait,"
8957,VALDEMAR,"Fortune will aid me, soon or late!"
8958,VALDEMAR,Perhaps the clay I may not find—
8959,VALDEMAR,But a strange tale is in the wind
8960,VALDEMAR,Of an old man whose life has been
8961,VALDEMAR,Shut up wild solitudes within
8962,VALDEMAR,On Alpine mountains. He has found
8963,VALDEMAR,What I have sought the world around.
8964,VALDEMAR,"A learnèd, godly man, he knows"
8965,VALDEMAR,How the full tide of being flows;
8966,VALDEMAR,"And he, in some mysterious way,"
8967,VALDEMAR,"Makes, if he cannot find, the clay."
8968,VALDEMAR,He will his secret share with me—
8969,VALDEMAR,"I go to him, Hermione!”"
8970,VALDEMAR,
8971,VALDEMAR,"“But, Valdemar,” she cried, “time flies,"
8972,VALDEMAR,"And while you dream, the vision dies!"
8973,VALDEMAR,And look! Our children suffer lack;
8974,VALDEMAR,There is no coat for Claudio’s back;
8975,VALDEMAR,"Theresa’s little feet, unshod,"
8976,VALDEMAR,Are torn by shards on which they trod;
8977,VALDEMAR,And Marcius cried but yesterday
8978,VALDEMAR,When the lads mocked him at their play.
8979,VALDEMAR,The very house is crumbling down;
8980,VALDEMAR,The broken hearth-stone needs repair;
8981,VALDEMAR,The roof is open to the air—
8982,VALDEMAR,It wakes the laughter of the town!
8983,VALDEMAR,O Valdemar! if you must go
8984,VALDEMAR,"Up to those trackless fields of snow,"
8985,VALDEMAR,Mould first from yonder common clay
8986,VALDEMAR,Something to keep the wolf away—
8987,VALDEMAR,"A Virgin for some humble shrine,"
8988,VALDEMAR,"A soldier clad in armor fine,"
8989,VALDEMAR,Or even such toys as Andrefels
8990,VALDEMAR,"To laughing, wondering children sells.”"
8991,VALDEMAR,
8992,VALDEMAR,"“Now murmur not, Hermione,"
8993,VALDEMAR,"But be thou patient,” answered he."
8994,VALDEMAR,“Why mind the laughter of the town?
8995,VALDEMAR,It cannot shake my fair renown!
8996,VALDEMAR,"A touch of hardship, now and then,"
8997,VALDEMAR,Will never harm our little men;
8998,VALDEMAR,"And as for this old, crumbling roof,"
8999,VALDEMAR,"Let rude winds put it to the proof,"
9000,VALDEMAR,And fierce heats gnaw the hearth-stone! I
9001,VALDEMAR,"Surely the Land of Promise spy,"
9002,VALDEMAR,"Where the fair vision of my dreams,"
9003,VALDEMAR,"Clothed in transcendent beauty, gleams!"
9004,VALDEMAR,In its white hand it holdeth up
9005,VALDEMAR,"For us, my love, a brimming cup"
9006,VALDEMAR,Where wealth and fame and joy divine
9007,VALDEMAR,Mingle in life’s most sparkling wine.
9008,VALDEMAR,"Bid me God-speed, Hermione,"
9009,VALDEMAR,"And kiss me, ere I go from thee!”"
9010,VALDEMAR,
9011,VALDEMAR,"So on he sped, from day to day—"
9012,VALDEMAR,"Past wheat-fields yellowing in the sun,"
9013,VALDEMAR,"Where scarlet-coated poppies run,"
9014,VALDEMAR,Gay soldiers ready for the fray—
9015,VALDEMAR,"Past vineyards purpling on the hills,"
9016,VALDEMAR,"Past sleeping lakes and dancing rills,"
9017,VALDEMAR,And homes like dovecotes nestling high
9018,VALDEMAR,Midway between the earth and sky!
9019,VALDEMAR,Then on he passed through valleys dim
9020,VALDEMAR,"Crowded with shadows gaunt and grim,"
9021,VALDEMAR,Up towering heights whence glaciers launch
9022,VALDEMAR,"Their swift-winged ships for seaward flight,"
9023,VALDEMAR,"Or where, dread messenger of fright,"
9024,VALDEMAR,Sweeps down the awful avalanche!
9025,VALDEMAR,And still upon the mountain side
9026,VALDEMAR,"To every man he met he cried,"
9027,VALDEMAR,"“Where shall I find, oh! tell me where,"
9028,VALDEMAR,"The hermit of this upper air,"
9029,VALDEMAR,Who Nature’s inmost secret knows?”
9030,VALDEMAR,"And, pointing to the eternal snows,"
9031,VALDEMAR,"Each man replied, with wagging head,"
9032,VALDEMAR,"“Up yonder, somewhere, it is said.”"
9033,VALDEMAR,
9034,VALDEMAR,"At length one day, as sank the sun,"
9035,VALDEMAR,"He reached a low hut, dark and dun,"
9036,VALDEMAR,"And, entering unbidden, found"
9037,VALDEMAR,An old man stretched upon the ground:
9038,VALDEMAR,"A white-haired, venerable man,"
9039,VALDEMAR,Whose eyes had hardly light to scan
9040,VALDEMAR,"The face that, blanched with awful fear,"
9041,VALDEMAR,"Bent down, his failing breath to hear."
9042,VALDEMAR,"“_Pax vobiscum_” he murmured low,"
9043,VALDEMAR,"“Shrive me, O brother, ere I go!”"
9044,VALDEMAR,
9045,VALDEMAR,"“No priest am I,” cried Valdemar."
9046,VALDEMAR,“Alas! alas! I came from far
9047,VALDEMAR,To learn thy secret of the clay—
9048,VALDEMAR,"Speak to me, sire, while yet you may!”"
9049,VALDEMAR,"But while he wet the parchèd lips,"
9050,VALDEMAR,The dull eyes closed in death’s eclipse;
9051,VALDEMAR,"And the old seer in silence lay,"
9052,VALDEMAR,"Himself a thing of pallid clay,"
9053,VALDEMAR,With all his secrets closely hid
9054,VALDEMAR,As Ramses’ in the pyramid.
9055,VALDEMAR,
9056,VALDEMAR,Long time within that lonely place
9057,VALDEMAR,"Valdemar lived, but found no trace"
9058,VALDEMAR,In learnèd book or parchment scroll
9059,VALDEMAR,(The ink scarce dry upon the roll)
9060,VALDEMAR,Of aught the stars had taught to him.
9061,VALDEMAR,"Within the wide horizon’s rim,"
9062,VALDEMAR,"Nor earth, nor sky, nor winds at play,"
9063,VALDEMAR,Knew the lost secret of the clay.
9064,VALDEMAR,
9065,VALDEMAR,"Then sought he, after journeyings hard,"
9066,VALDEMAR,The holy monks of St. Bernard.
9067,VALDEMAR,"But they—ah, yes!—they knew him well,"
9068,VALDEMAR,A man not ruled by book and bell.
9069,VALDEMAR,"Godly, perhaps—but much inclined"
9070,VALDEMAR,Some newer road to heaven to find.
9071,VALDEMAR,"And was he dead? God rest his soul,"
9072,VALDEMAR,After this life of toil and dole!
9073,VALDEMAR,
9074,VALDEMAR,And that was all! O Valdemar!
9075,VALDEMAR,"Fly to thy desolate home afar,"
9076,VALDEMAR,"Where wasted, worn, Hermione,"
9077,VALDEMAR,"With her pale children at her knee,"
9078,VALDEMAR,Beside the broken hearth-stone weeps!
9079,VALDEMAR,
9080,VALDEMAR,"He finds her, smiling as she sleeps,"
9081,VALDEMAR,"For night more tender is than day,"
9082,VALDEMAR,And softly wipes our tears away.
9083,VALDEMAR,"“Oh, wake, Hermione!” he cries,"
9084,VALDEMAR,As one whose spirit inly dies;
9085,VALDEMAR,“Hear me confess that I have been
9086,VALDEMAR,False to thee in my pride and sin!
9087,VALDEMAR,God give me grace from this blest day
9088,VALDEMAR,To do His work in common clay! ”
9089,VALDEMAR,
9090,VALDEMAR,"Next morn, in humble, sweet content,"
9091,VALDEMAR,"Into his studio he went,"
9092,VALDEMAR,"Eager to test his willing hand,"
9093,VALDEMAR,And rule the clay with wise command.
9094,VALDEMAR,"But no fair wonder first he wrought,"
9095,VALDEMAR,"No marvel of creative thought,"
9096,VALDEMAR,"Not even a Virgin for a shrine,"
9097,VALDEMAR,Or soldier clad in armor fine—
9098,VALDEMAR,Only such toys as Andrefels
9099,VALDEMAR,"To laughing, wondering children sells!"
9100,VALDEMAR,
9101,VALDEMAR,One day he knelt him gravely down
9102,VALDEMAR,"Beside the hearth-stone, rent and brown."
9103,VALDEMAR,"“And now, my patient wife,” said he,"
9104,VALDEMAR,"“What can be done with this, we’ll see.”"
9105,VALDEMAR,With straining arm and crimsoned face
9106,VALDEMAR,"He pried the mortar from its place,"
9107,VALDEMAR,"Lifted the heavy stone aside,"
9108,VALDEMAR,And left a cavern yawning wide.
9109,VALDEMAR,"Oh, wondrous tale! At set of sun"
9110,VALDEMAR,The guerdon of his search was won;
9111,VALDEMAR,And where his broken hearth-stone lay
9112,VALDEMAR,He found at last the perfect clay!

9262,THE URN,Across the blue Atlantic waves
9263,THE URN,She sent a little gift to me:
9264,THE URN,A golden urn—a graceful toy
9265,THE URN,As one need care to see.
9266,THE URN,
9267,THE URN,"Smiling, I held it in my hand,"
9268,THE URN,"Thinking her message o’er and o’er,"
9269,THE URN,Nor dreamed her swift feet pressed so near
9270,THE URN,The undiscovered shore.
9271,THE URN,
9272,THE URN,Oh! had it been a funeral urn—
9273,THE URN,The gift my darling sent to me
9274,THE URN,With loving thoughts and tender words
9275,THE URN,Across the heaving sea—
9276,THE URN,
9277,THE URN,A funeral urn which might have held
9278,THE URN,"Her sacred ashes, sealed in rest"
9279,THE URN,Utter as that which holds in thrall
9280,THE URN,Some pulseless marble breast!
9281,THE URN,
9282,THE URN,Where drifts she now? On what far seas
9283,THE URN,Floateth to-day her golden hair?

9295,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"“What, ho!” he cried, as up and down"
9296,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,He rode through the streets of Windham town—
9297,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"“What, ho! for the day of peace is done,"
9298,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,And the day of wrath too well begun!
9299,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Bring forth the grain from your barns and mills;
9300,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Drive down the cattle from off your hills;
9301,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"For Boston lieth in sore distress,"
9302,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Pallid with hunger and long duress:
9303,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Her children starve, while she hears the beat"

9306,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"“What, ho! What, ho!” Like a storm unspent,"

9309,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Leaning bareheaded that August day,"
9310,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"While the sun beat down on his temples gray,"
9311,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Watched him until he could see no more.
9312,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Then straight he strode to the church, and flung"
9313,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,His whole soul into the peal he rung;
9314,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Pulling the bell-rope till the tower

9321,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,To hear what the parson had to say
9322,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,That would not keep till the Sabbath-day.
9323,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,For only the women and children knew
9324,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,The tale of the horsemen galloping through—
9325,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,The message he bore as up and down
9326,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,He rode through the streets of Windham town.
9327,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,
9328,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"That night, as the parson sat at ease"
9329,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"In the porch, with his Bible on his knees,"
9330,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,(Thanking God that at break of day
9331,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Frederic Manning would take his way,"
9332,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"With cattle and sheep from off the hills,"
9333,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"And a load of grain from the barns and mills,"
9334,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,To the starving city where General Gage
9335,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Waited unholy war to wage),"
9336,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"His little daughter beside him stood,"
9337,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Hiding her face in her muslin hood.
9338,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,
9339,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"In her arms her own pet lamb she bore,"
9340,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,As it struggled down to the oaken floor:
9341,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"“It must go; I must give my lamb,” she said,"
9342,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"“To the children that cry for meat and bread,”"
9343,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Then lifted to his her holy eyes,"
9344,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Wet with the tears of sacrifice.
9345,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"“Nay, nay,” he answered. “There is no need"
9346,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,That the hearts of babes should ache and bleed.
9347,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Run away to your bed, and to-morrow play,"
9348,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"You and your pet, through the livelong day.”"
9349,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,
9350,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"He laid his hand on her shining hair,"
9351,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"And smiled as he blessed her, standing there,"
9352,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"With kerchief folded across her breast,"
9353,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"And her small brown hands together pressed,"
9354,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"A quaint little maiden, shy and sweet,"
9355,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,With her lambkin crouched at her dainty feet.
9356,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Away to its place the lamb she led,"
9357,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Then climbed the stairs to her own white bed,"
9358,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,While the moon rose up and the stars looked down
9359,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,On the silent streets of Windham town.
9360,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,
9361,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"But when the heralds of morning came,"
9362,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Flushing the east with rosy flame,"
9363,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"With low of cattle and scurry of feet,"
9364,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Driving his herd down the village street,"
9365,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Young Manning heard from a low stone wall
9366,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,A child’s voice clearly yet softly call;
9367,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,And saw in the gray dusk standing there
9368,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"A little maiden with shining hair,"
9369,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,While crowding close to her tender side
9370,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Was a snow-white lamb to her apron tied.
9371,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,
9372,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"“Oh, wait!” she cried, “for my lamb must go"
9373,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,To the children crying in want and woe.
9374,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,It is all I have.” And her tears fell fast
9375,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,As she gave it one eager kiss—the last.
9376,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,“The road will be long to its feet. I pray
9377,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Let your arms be its bed a part of the way;
9378,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,And give it cool water and tender grass
9379,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Whenever a way-side brook you pass.”
9380,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Then away she flew like a startled deer,"
9381,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Nor waited the bleat of her lamb to hear.
9382,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,
9383,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Young Manning lifted his steel-blue eyes
9384,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,One moment up to the morning skies;
9385,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Then, raising the lamb to his breast, he strode"
9386,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Sturdily down the lengthening road.
9387,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"“Now God be my helper,” he cried, “and lead"
9388,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,Me safe with my charge to the souls in need!
9389,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Through fire and flood, through dearth and dole,"
9390,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,"Though foes assail me and war-clouds roll,"
9391,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,To the city in want and woe that lies
9392,THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER,I will bear this lamb as a sacrifice.”

9674,EASTER MORNING,"Dame Margaret spake to Annie Blair,"
9675,EASTER MORNING,"To Annie Blair spake she,"
9676,EASTER MORNING,As from beneath her wrinkled hand
9677,EASTER MORNING,She peered far out to sea.
9678,EASTER MORNING,
9679,EASTER MORNING,"“Look forth, look forth, O Annie Blair,"
9680,EASTER MORNING,For my old eyes are dim;
9681,EASTER MORNING,See you a single boat afloat
9682,EASTER MORNING,Within the horizon’s rim?”
9683,EASTER MORNING,
9684,EASTER MORNING,"Sweet Annie looked to east, to west,"
9685,EASTER MORNING,To north and south looked she:
9686,EASTER MORNING,There was no single boat afloat
9687,EASTER MORNING,Upon the angry sea.
9688,EASTER MORNING,
9689,EASTER MORNING,"The sky was dark, the winds were high,"
9690,EASTER MORNING,"The breakers lashed the shore,"
9691,EASTER MORNING,And louder and still louder swelled
9692,EASTER MORNING,The tempest’s sullen roar.
9693,EASTER MORNING,
9694,EASTER MORNING,"“Look forth again,” Dame Margaret cried;"
9695,EASTER MORNING,“Doth any boat come in?”
9696,EASTER MORNING,And scarce she heard the answering word
9697,EASTER MORNING,Above the furious din.
9698,EASTER MORNING,
9699,EASTER MORNING,“Pray God no boat may put to sea
9700,EASTER MORNING,In such a gale!” she said;
9701,EASTER MORNING,“Pray God no soul may dare to-night
9702,EASTER MORNING,The rocks of Danger Head!”
9703,EASTER MORNING,
9704,EASTER MORNING,"“This is Good Friday, Annie Blair,”"
9705,EASTER MORNING,"Dame Margaret cried again,"
9706,EASTER MORNING,"“When Mary’s Son, the Merciful,"
9707,EASTER MORNING,On Calvary was slain.
9708,EASTER MORNING,
9709,EASTER MORNING,"The earth did quake, the rocks were rent,"
9710,EASTER MORNING,"The graves were opened wide,"
9711,EASTER MORNING,And darkness like to this fell down
9712,EASTER MORNING,When He—the Holy—died.
9713,EASTER MORNING,
9714,EASTER MORNING,"Give me your hand, O Annie Blair;"
9715,EASTER MORNING,Your two knees fall upon;
9716,EASTER MORNING,Christ send to you your lover back—
9717,EASTER MORNING,"To me, my only son!”"
9718,EASTER MORNING,
9719,EASTER MORNING,"All night they watched, all night they prayed,"
9720,EASTER MORNING,All night they heard the roar
9721,EASTER MORNING,Of the fierce breakers dashing high
9722,EASTER MORNING,Upon the lonely shore.
9723,EASTER MORNING,
9724,EASTER MORNING,"Oh, hark! strange footsteps on the sand,"
9725,EASTER MORNING,A voice above the din:
9726,EASTER MORNING,“Dame Margaret! Dame Margaret!
9727,EASTER MORNING,Is Annie Blair within?
9728,EASTER MORNING,
9729,EASTER MORNING,High on the rocks of Danger Head
9730,EASTER MORNING,"Her lover’s boat is cast,"
9731,EASTER MORNING,"All rudderless, all anchorless—"
9732,EASTER MORNING,Mere hull and splintered mast.”
9733,EASTER MORNING,
9734,EASTER MORNING,"Oh, hark! slow footsteps on the sand,"
9735,EASTER MORNING,And women wailing sore:
9736,EASTER MORNING,“Dame Margaret! Dame Margaret!
9737,EASTER MORNING,Your son you’ll see no more!
9738,EASTER MORNING,
9739,EASTER MORNING,God pity you! Christ comfort you!”
9740,EASTER MORNING,The weeping women cried;
9741,EASTER MORNING,But “May God pity Annie Blair!”
9742,EASTER MORNING,Dame Margaret replied.
9743,EASTER MORNING,
9744,EASTER MORNING,"“For life is long and youth is strong,"
9745,EASTER MORNING,And it must still bear on.
9746,EASTER MORNING,Leave us alone to make our moan—
9747,EASTER MORNING,"My son! alas, my son!”"

9750,EASTER MORNING,
9751,EASTER MORNING,"The Easter morning, flushed with joy,"
9752,EASTER MORNING,"Saw all the winds at rest,"
9753,EASTER MORNING,And far and near the blue sea smiled
9754,EASTER MORNING,With sunshine on its breast.
9755,EASTER MORNING,
9756,EASTER MORNING,"The neighbors came, the neighbors went;"
9757,EASTER MORNING,They sought the house of prayer;
9758,EASTER MORNING,But on the rocks of Danger Head
9759,EASTER MORNING,"The dame and Annie Blair,"
9760,EASTER MORNING,
9761,EASTER MORNING,"With still, white faces, watched the deep"
9762,EASTER MORNING,Without a tear or moan.
9763,EASTER MORNING,"“I cannot weep,” said Annie Blair—"
9764,EASTER MORNING,“My heart is turned to stone.”
9765,EASTER MORNING,
9766,EASTER MORNING,"Forth from the church the pastor came,"
9767,EASTER MORNING,"And up the rocks strode he,"
9768,EASTER MORNING,Baring his thin white locks to meet
9769,EASTER MORNING,The salt breath of the sea.
9770,EASTER MORNING,
9771,EASTER MORNING,"“The rocks shall rend, the earth shall quake,"
9772,EASTER MORNING,"The sea give up its dead,"
9773,EASTER MORNING,For Christ our Lord is risen indeed—
9774,EASTER MORNING,"’Tis Easter morn,” he said."
9775,EASTER MORNING,
9776,EASTER MORNING,"Oh, hark! oh, hark! A startled cry,"
9777,EASTER MORNING,"A rush of hurrying feet,"
9778,EASTER MORNING,The swarming of a hundred men
9779,EASTER MORNING,Adown the village street.
9780,EASTER MORNING,
9781,EASTER MORNING,“Now unto God and Christ the Lord
9782,EASTER MORNING,Be praise and thanks alway!
9783,EASTER MORNING,The sea hath given up its dead
9784,EASTER MORNING,This blessed Easter-day.”

9803,SEALED ORDERS,

9805,SEALED ORDERS,"“O captain, tell me true,"

9823,SEALED ORDERS,
9824,SEALED ORDERS,"Then sailed we on, and sailed we east"
9825,SEALED ORDERS,Into the whirlwind’s track.
9826,SEALED ORDERS,"Wild was the tempest overhead,"
9827,SEALED ORDERS,The sea was strewn with wrack.
9828,SEALED ORDERS,
9829,SEALED ORDERS,"“Oh, turn thee, turn thee, captain,"
9830,SEALED ORDERS,Thou’rt rushing on to death!”
9831,SEALED ORDERS,"But back he answer shouted,"
9832,SEALED ORDERS,With unabated breath:
9833,SEALED ORDERS,
9834,SEALED ORDERS,"“Turn back who will, I turn not!"
9835,SEALED ORDERS,"For this one thing I know,"

9838,SEALED ORDERS,
9839,SEALED ORDERS,"“Oh, art thou fool or madman?"
9840,SEALED ORDERS,"Thy port is but a dream,"
9841,SEALED ORDERS,And never on the horizon’s rim
9842,SEALED ORDERS,Will its fair turrets gleam.”
9843,SEALED ORDERS,
9844,SEALED ORDERS,"Then smiled the captain wisely,"
9845,SEALED ORDERS,"And slowly answered he,"
9846,SEALED ORDERS,The while his keen glance widened
9847,SEALED ORDERS,Over the lonely sea:
9848,SEALED ORDERS,
9849,SEALED ORDERS,“I carry sealéd orders.

10089,MY WONDERLAND,
10090,MY WONDERLAND,"In this same Wonderland, one sweet spring day,"
10091,MY WONDERLAND,"In a gray casket, deftly hidden away,"
10092,MY WONDERLAND,I found two pearls; but as I looked they grew
10093,MY WONDERLAND,"To living jewels, that took wing and flew."
10094,MY WONDERLAND,
10095,MY WONDERLAND,"And once a creeping worm, within my sight"
10096,MY WONDERLAND,"Wove its own shroud and coffin, sealed and white"
10097,MY WONDERLAND,"Then, bursting from its cerements, soared in air,"
10098,MY WONDERLAND,"A radiant vision, most supremely fair."
10099,MY WONDERLAND,
10100,MY WONDERLAND,"Out of the darksome mould, before my eyes"
10101,MY WONDERLAND,"I saw a shaft of emerald arise,"
10102,MY WONDERLAND,"Bearing a silver chalice veined with gold,"
10103,MY WONDERLAND,And set with gems of splendors manifold.
10104,MY WONDERLAND,
10105,MY WONDERLAND,"Once in a vast, pale, hollow pearl I stood,"
10106,MY WONDERLAND,When o’er the vaulted dome there swept a flood
10107,MY WONDERLAND,"Of lurid waves, and a dark funeral pyre"
10108,MY WONDERLAND,Took to its heart a globe of crimson fire.
10109,MY WONDERLAND,
10110,MY WONDERLAND,The pageant faded. Lo! the pearl became
10111,MY WONDERLAND,"A liquid sapphire, touched with rosy flame;"
10112,MY WONDERLAND,"And as I gazed, a silver crescent hung"
10113,MY WONDERLAND,"In violet depths, a thousand stars among."
10114,MY WONDERLAND,
10115,MY WONDERLAND,"I saw a woman, marvellously fair,"
10116,MY WONDERLAND,"Flushed with warm life, and buoyant as the air;"
10117,MY WONDERLAND,"Next morn she was a statue, breathless, cold,"
10118,MY WONDERLAND,A marble goddess of transcendent mould.
10119,MY WONDERLAND,
10120,MY WONDERLAND,"I saw a folded bud, in one short hour,"
10121,MY WONDERLAND,"Open its sweet, warm heart and be a flower."
10122,MY WONDERLAND,"O Wonderland! thou art so near, so far;"
10123,MY WONDERLAND,"Near as this rose, remote as yonder star!"

10129,THE GUEST,"Surely, when the house was made,"
10130,THE GUEST,"In its chambers wide and free,"
10131,THE GUEST,There was set a place for thee.
10132,THE GUEST,"Surely, in some room was spread"
10133,THE GUEST,"For thy sake a snowy bed,"
10134,THE GUEST,"Decked with linen white and fine,"
10135,THE GUEST,"Meet, O Guest, for use of thine."
10136,THE GUEST,
10137,THE GUEST,Yet thou hast not kept the tryst.
10138,THE GUEST,Other guests our lips have kissed:
10139,THE GUEST,"Other guests have tarried long,"
10140,THE GUEST,Wooed by sunshine and by song;
10141,THE GUEST,"For the year was bright with May,"
10142,THE GUEST,"All the birds kept holiday,"

10150,THE GUEST,"Love hath sat beside our board,"
10151,THE GUEST,"Brought us treasures from his hoard,"
10152,THE GUEST,"Brimmed our cups with fragrant wine,"
10153,THE GUEST,Vintage of the hills divine.
10154,THE GUEST,
10155,THE GUEST,Down our garden path has strayed
10156,THE GUEST,"Young Romance, in light arrayed;"
10157,THE GUEST,Joy hath flung her garlands wide;
10158,THE GUEST,Faith sung low at eventide;
10159,THE GUEST,Care hath flitted in and out;
10160,THE GUEST,Sorrow strewn her weeds about;
10161,THE GUEST,Hope held up her torch on high
10162,THE GUEST,When clouds darkened all the sky.
10163,THE GUEST,
10164,THE GUEST,"Pain, with pallid lips and thin,"
10165,THE GUEST,Oft hath slept our house within;
10166,THE GUEST,"Life hath called us, loud and long,"
10167,THE GUEST,With a voice as trumpet strong.
10168,THE GUEST,"Sometimes we have thought, O Guest,"
10169,THE GUEST,"Thou wert coming with the rest,"
10170,THE GUEST,Watched to see thy shadow fall
10171,THE GUEST,On the inner chamber wall.
10172,THE GUEST,
10173,THE GUEST,"For we know that, soon or late,"
10174,THE GUEST,"Thou wilt enter at the gate,"
10175,THE GUEST,"Cross the threshold, pass the door,"
10176,THE GUEST,Glide at will from floor to floor.
10177,THE GUEST,"When thou comest, by this sign"
10178,THE GUEST,"We shall know thee, Guest divine:"

10183,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN
10184,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,
10185,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"An old-fashioned garden? Yes, my dear,"
10186,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,No doubt it is. I was thinking here
10187,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Only to-day, as I sat in the sun,"
10188,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,How fair was the scene I looked upon;
10189,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Yet wondered still, with a vague surprise,"
10190,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,How it might look to other eyes.
10191,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,
10192,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,’Tis a wide old garden. Not a bed
10193,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Cut here and there in the turf; instead,"
10194,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"The broad straight paths run east and west,"
10195,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Down which two horsemen could ride abreast,"
10196,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"And north and south with an equal state,"
10197,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,From the gray stone wall to the low white gate.
10198,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,
10199,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"And, where they cross on the middle line,"
10200,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,Virgin’s-bower and wild woodbine
10201,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,Clamber and climb at their own sweet will
10202,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,Over the latticed arbor still;
10203,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Though since they were planted years have flown,"
10204,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,And many a time have the roses blown.
10205,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,
10206,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"To the right the hill runs down to the river,"
10207,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Where the willows droop and the aspens shiver,"
10208,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,And under the shade of the hemlock-trees
10209,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,The low ferns nod to the passing breeze;
10210,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"There wild flowers blossom, and mosses creep"
10211,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,With a tangle of vines o’er the wooded steep.
10212,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,
10213,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"So quiet it is, so cool and still,"
10214,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,In the green retreat of the shady hill!
10215,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"And you scarce can tell, as you look within,"
10216,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,Where the garden ends and the woods begin.
10217,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"But here, where we stand, what a blaze of light,"
10218,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"What a wealth of color, makes glad the sight!"
10219,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,
10220,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,Red roses burn in the morning glow;
10221,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,White roses proffer their cups of snow;
10222,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,In scarlet and crimson and cloth-of-gold
10223,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"The zinnias flaunt, and the marigold;"
10224,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"And stately and tall the lilies stand,"
10225,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Like vestal virgins, on either hand."
10226,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,
10227,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Here gay sweet-peas, like butterflies,"
10228,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,Flutter and dance under summer skies;
10229,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Blue violets here in the shade are set,"
10230,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,With a border of fragrant mignonette;
10231,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"And here are pansies and columbine,"
10232,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,And the burning stars of the cypress-vine.
10233,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,
10234,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Stately hollyhocks, row on row,"
10235,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Golden sunflowers, all aglow,"
10236,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Scarlet poppies, and larkspurs blue,"
10237,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,Asters of every shade and hue;
10238,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"And over the wall, like a trail of fire,"
10239,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,The red nasturtium climbs high and higher.
10240,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,
10241,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"My lady’s-slippers are fair to see,"
10242,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"And her pinks are as sweet as sweet can be,"
10243,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"With gilly-flowers and mourning-brides,"
10244,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,And many another flower besides.
10245,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,Do you see that rose without a thorn?
10246,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,It was planted the year my Hal was born.
10247,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,
10248,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"And he is a man now. Yes, my dear,"
10249,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"An old-fashioned garden! But, sitting here,"
10250,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,I think how often lover and maid
10251,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Down these long flowery paths have strayed,"
10252,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,And how little feet have over them run
10253,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,That will stir no more in shade or sun.
10254,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,
10255,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"As one who reads from an open book,"
10256,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,On these fair luminous scrolls I look;
10257,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,And all the story of life is there—
10258,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,"Its loves and losses, hope and despair."
10259,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,An old-fashioned garden—but to my eyes
10260,AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN,Fair as the hills of Paradise.

10268,I.,(_The Brier Rose speaks._)
10269,I.,

10271,I.,"Outside, where the grasses grow;"
10272,I.,"Where the tall weeds flaunt in the sun,"
10273,I.,And the yellow mulleins blow.
10274,I.,The dock and the thistle crowd
10275,I.,"Close to my shrinking feet,"
10276,I.,And the gypsy yarrow shares
10277,I.,My cup and the food I eat.
10278,I.,
10279,I.,"The rude winds toss my hair,"
10280,I.,"The wild rains beat me down,"

10282,I.,And thick on my leafy crown.
10283,I.,I cannot keep my robes

10285,I.,And the veriest beggar dares
10286,I.,To stop and gaze at me.
10287,I.,
10288,I.,Sometimes I climb and climb
10289,I.,"To the top of the garden wall,"
10290,I.,"And I see her where she stands,"
10291,I.,Stately and fair and tall—
10292,I.,"My sister, the red, red Rose,"
10293,I.,"My sister, the royal one,"
10294,I.,The fairest flower that blows
10295,I.,Under the summer sun!
10296,I.,
10297,I.,What wonder that she is fair?
10298,I.,What wonder that she is sweet?
10299,I.,The treasures of earth and air
10300,I.,Lie at her dainty feet;
10301,I.,"The choicest fare is hers,"

10303,I.,"Rich are her emerald robes,"
10304,I.,And her bed is soft and fine.
10305,I.,
10306,I.,She need not lift her head
10307,I.,Even to sip the dew;
10308,I.,No rude touch makes her shrink
10309,I.,The whole long summer through.
10310,I.,Her servants do her will;
10311,I.,They come at her beck and call.

10325,II.,"Does the bird, I wonder, know"

10327,II.,The bright days come and go?
10328,II.,
10329,II.,"The garden path runs north,"
10330,II.,And the garden path runs south;
10331,II.,"The brown bee hums in the sun,"
10332,II.,And kisses the lily’s mouth;
10333,II.,"But it flies away, away,"
10334,II.,"To the birch-tree, dark and tall."
10335,II.,"What do you find, O brown bee,"
10336,II.,Over the garden wall?
10337,II.,
10338,II.,"With ruff and farthingale,"
10339,II.,"Under the gardener’s eye,"
10340,II.,In trimmest guise I stand—
10341,II.,"Oh, who so fine as I?"
10342,II.,But even the light wind knows
10343,II.,"That it may not play with me,"
10344,II.,Nor touch my beautiful lips
10345,II.,With a wild caress and free.
10346,II.,
10347,II.,"Oh, straight is the garden path,"

10353,II.,"They dance and flutter and sing,"
10354,II.,And I listen all day long.
10355,II.,
10356,II.,The Brier Rose swings outside;
10357,II.,Sometimes she climbs so high
10358,II.,I can see her sweet pink face
10359,II.,Against the blue of the sky.
10360,II.,"What wonder that she is fair,"
10361,II.,Whom no strait bonds enthrall?
10362,II.,"Oh, rare is life to the Brier Rose,"

10374,THE DOVES AT MENDON,"Low and soft, like a mellow horn,"
10375,THE DOVES AT MENDON,"While the sunshine over her falls,"
10376,THE DOVES AT MENDON,Over and over she calls and calls

10388,THE DOVES AT MENDON,And then a rush through the ether blue;

10411,THE DOVES AT MENDON,"Straight as an arrow shot from a bow,"
10412,THE DOVES AT MENDON,"Wheeling and circling high and low,"
10413,THE DOVES AT MENDON,Down they fly from the slanting roof
10414,THE DOVES AT MENDON,Of the old red barn at Mendon.

10435,THE DOVES AT MENDON,"Then sinks the sun, and the mountain breeze"

10442,A LATE ROSE,
10443,A LATE ROSE,I sent a little maiden
10444,A LATE ROSE,"To pluck for me a rose,"

10447,A LATE ROSE,"A blush-rose, proud and tender,"
10448,A LATE ROSE,"Upon its stem so slender,"
10449,A LATE ROSE,Swaying in dreamy splendor
10450,A LATE ROSE,Where yellow sunshine glows.
10451,A LATE ROSE,
10452,A LATE ROSE,Back came the little maiden
10453,A LATE ROSE,"With drooping, downcast head,"
10454,A LATE ROSE,"And slow, reluctant footsteps,"

10458,A LATE ROSE,There are no summer roses;
10459,A LATE ROSE,It must be they are dead!”
10460,A LATE ROSE,
10461,A LATE ROSE,Then bent I to the maiden

10465,A LATE ROSE,"“Nay!” said I, “let the roses"

10498,PERIWINKLE,"Making friends with bird and bee,"
10499,PERIWINKLE,"Flying high, flying low;"
10500,PERIWINKLE,"In and out, where lilies blowing"
10501,PERIWINKLE,"Nod above wild grasses growing,"
10502,PERIWINKLE,Where the sweet-fern and the brake

10521,PERIWINKLE,“Drop the bars—I’m tired of roaming

10536,AFTERNOON,Too fast thy glad hours slip away;
10537,AFTERNOON,"The morn, the noon,"
10538,AFTERNOON,Have fled too soon—
10539,AFTERNOON,"Delay, O golden afternoon!"
10540,AFTERNOON,

10543,AFTERNOON,"Whose dazzling course is half-way run,"
10544,AFTERNOON,"Stay, stay thy flight"
10545,AFTERNOON,"Down yon blue height,"
10546,AFTERNOON,Nor haste thee to the arms of night!
10547,AFTERNOON,
10548,AFTERNOON,The west wind blows
10549,AFTERNOON,"O’er beds of rose,"
10550,AFTERNOON,But does not stir my deep repose.
10551,AFTERNOON,In dreamful guise
10552,AFTERNOON,"I close mine eyes,"
10553,AFTERNOON,Borne on its wings to Paradise.
10554,AFTERNOON,
10555,AFTERNOON,Beneath this tree
10556,AFTERNOON,Half consciously.
10557,AFTERNOON,"I share the life of all things free,"
10558,AFTERNOON,Hearing the beat
10559,AFTERNOON,"Of rhythmic feet,"
10560,AFTERNOON,As the grasses run my hand to meet.
10561,AFTERNOON,
10562,AFTERNOON,"The wild bee’s hum,"
10563,AFTERNOON,"The lone bird’s drum,"
10564,AFTERNOON,O’er the wide pastures faintly come;
10565,AFTERNOON,And soft and clear
10566,AFTERNOON,Falls on my ear
10567,AFTERNOON,"The cow-bell’s tinkle, far and near!"
10568,AFTERNOON,
10569,AFTERNOON,Before my eyes
10570,AFTERNOON,"Three blue peaks rise,"
10571,AFTERNOON,Piercing the bright autumnal skies;
10572,AFTERNOON,"Silent and grand,"
10573,AFTERNOON,"On either hand,"
10574,AFTERNOON,Far mountain heights majestic stand.
10575,AFTERNOON,
10576,AFTERNOON,By wreaths of mist
10577,AFTERNOON,The vales are kissed—
10578,AFTERNOON,"Fair, floating clouds of amethyst,"
10579,AFTERNOON,"That follow on,"
10580,AFTERNOON,"Through shade and sun,"
10581,AFTERNOON,Where’er the river’s course may run.
10582,AFTERNOON,
10583,AFTERNOON,"Here, looking down"
10584,AFTERNOON,"On roof-trees brown,"
10585,AFTERNOON,I catch fair glimpses of the town.
10586,AFTERNOON,"There, far away,"
10587,AFTERNOON,The shadows play
10588,AFTERNOON,"On crags and bowlders, huge and gray."
10589,AFTERNOON,
10590,AFTERNOON,"All whispering low,"
10591,AFTERNOON,The breezes go—
10592,AFTERNOON,The wandering birds flit to and fro;
10593,AFTERNOON,Winged motes float by
10594,AFTERNOON,"Me as I lie,"
10595,AFTERNOON,And yellow leaves drop silently.
10596,AFTERNOON,
10597,AFTERNOON,"The morn, the noon,"
10598,AFTERNOON,Have fled too soon—
10599,AFTERNOON,"Delay, O golden afternoon,"
10600,AFTERNOON,While with rapt eyes
10601,AFTERNOON,My spirit flies
10602,AFTERNOON,From yon blue peaks to Paradise!

10879,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"She scanned the desert wide,"
10880,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,In all its lonely reaches
10881,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,There was no soul beside—
10882,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,
10883,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"No track to guide her onward,"
10884,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"No footprints in the sand,"
10885,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"Only the vast, still spaces"
10886,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,Wide-stretched on either hand!
10887,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,
10888,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,Night came—but where the Wise Men
10889,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"Had seen His burning star,"
10890,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,No glorious sign beheld she
10891,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"Clear beaming from afar,"
10892,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,
10893,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,Though Orion and Arcturus
10894,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"Shone bright above her head,"
10895,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,And up the heavenly arches
10896,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,Proud Mars his legions led!
10897,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,
10898,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,*       *       *       *       *
10899,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,
10900,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,She did not find the Christ-child.
10901,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"’Tis said she seeks Him still,"
10902,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,Over the wide earth roaming
10903,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"With swift, remorseful will."
10904,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,
10905,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,Her thin white locks the dew-fall
10906,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,Of every clime has wet—
10907,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,In palace and in hovel
10908,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,She seeks Messiah yet!
10909,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,
10910,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,In every child she fancies
10911,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"The Hidden One may be,"
10912,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,On each bright head she gazes
10913,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,The mystic crown to see.
10914,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,
10915,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"She twines the Christmas garlands,"
10916,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"She lights the Christmas fires,"
10917,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,She leads the joyful carols
10918,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,Of all the Christmas choirs;
10919,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,
10920,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"She feeds the poor and hungry,"
10921,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,And on her tender breast
10922,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,She soothes all suffering children
10923,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"To softest, sweetest rest."
10924,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,
10925,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"Attend her, holy Angels!"
10926,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,"Guard her, ye Cherubim!"
10927,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,For whatsoe’er she does for these
10928,A CHRISTMAS BALLAD,She does it as to Him!

10935,AN EASTER POEM,"Mary Magdalenè,"
10936,AN EASTER POEM,"At the break of day,"
10937,AN EASTER POEM,Wan with tears and watching
10938,AN EASTER POEM,Hasted on her way;
10939,AN EASTER POEM,
10940,AN EASTER POEM,"Bearing costly spices,"
10941,AN EASTER POEM,"Myrrh, and sweet perfume,"
10942,AN EASTER POEM,Through the shadowy garden
10943,AN EASTER POEM,To the Master’s tomb.
10944,AN EASTER POEM,
10945,AN EASTER POEM,Slowly broke the gray dawn:
10946,AN EASTER POEM,On her head the breeze
10947,AN EASTER POEM,Shook a rain of dew-drops
10948,AN EASTER POEM,From the cypress-trees.
10949,AN EASTER POEM,
10950,AN EASTER POEM,Rose and lily parted
10951,AN EASTER POEM,"As to let her pass,"
10952,AN EASTER POEM,And the violets blessed her
10953,AN EASTER POEM,From the tender grass.
10954,AN EASTER POEM,
10955,AN EASTER POEM,Little heed she paid them;
10956,AN EASTER POEM,"Christ, the Lord, was dead;"
10957,AN EASTER POEM,"All at last was over,"
10958,AN EASTER POEM,All at last was said.
10959,AN EASTER POEM,
10960,AN EASTER POEM,What of hope remainèd?
10961,AN EASTER POEM,"Black against the sky,"
10962,AN EASTER POEM,Calvary’s awful crosses
10963,AN EASTER POEM,Stretched their arms on high!
10964,AN EASTER POEM,
10965,AN EASTER POEM,Mary Magdalenè
10966,AN EASTER POEM,Made her bitter moan:
10967,AN EASTER POEM,“From the sealèd sepulchre
10968,AN EASTER POEM,Who shall roll the stone?”
10969,AN EASTER POEM,
10970,AN EASTER POEM,"Swift she ran, her spirit"
10971,AN EASTER POEM,Filled with awe and fear;
10972,AN EASTER POEM,Wide the door stood open
10973,AN EASTER POEM,As her feet drew near!
10974,AN EASTER POEM,
10975,AN EASTER POEM,All the place was flooded
10976,AN EASTER POEM,With a radiance bright;
10977,AN EASTER POEM,Forth into the darkness
10978,AN EASTER POEM,Streamed a holy light.
10979,AN EASTER POEM,
10980,AN EASTER POEM,"Down she stooped, and peering"
10981,AN EASTER POEM,"The dread tomb within,"
10982,AN EASTER POEM,Saw a great white angel
10983,AN EASTER POEM,Where the Lord had been!
10984,AN EASTER POEM,
10985,AN EASTER POEM,Sore she cried in anguish:
10986,AN EASTER POEM,“Who hath him betrayed?
10987,AN EASTER POEM,They have taken away my Lord!
10988,AN EASTER POEM,Where is he laid?”
10989,AN EASTER POEM,
10990,AN EASTER POEM,"“Nay,” the shining angel,"
10991,AN EASTER POEM,"Calmly smiling, said—"
10992,AN EASTER POEM,“Why seek ye the living
10993,AN EASTER POEM,Down among the dead?
10994,AN EASTER POEM,
10995,AN EASTER POEM,"He is not here, but risen!”"
10996,AN EASTER POEM,All her soul stood still;
10997,AN EASTER POEM,Through her trembling pulses
10998,AN EASTER POEM,Ran a conscious thrill.
10999,AN EASTER POEM,
11000,AN EASTER POEM,“Mary!” said a low voice;
11001,AN EASTER POEM,“Rabboni!” answered she.
11002,AN EASTER POEM,Then life was brought to light
11003,AN EASTER POEM,And immortality!
11004,AN EASTER POEM,
11005,AN EASTER POEM,"Mary Magdalenè,"
11006,AN EASTER POEM,First of woman born
11007,AN EASTER POEM,To see the clear light streaming
11008,AN EASTER POEM,O’er the hills of morn;
11009,AN EASTER POEM,
11010,AN EASTER POEM,"First to hail the Lord Christ,"
11011,AN EASTER POEM,"Conqueror of Death,"
11012,AN EASTER POEM,First to bow before Him
11013,AN EASTER POEM,With abated breath;
11014,AN EASTER POEM,
11015,AN EASTER POEM,First to hear the Master
11016,AN EASTER POEM,"Say—“From Death’s dark prison,"
11017,AN EASTER POEM,"From its bonds and fetters,"
11018,AN EASTER POEM,Lo! I have arisen!
11019,AN EASTER POEM,
11020,AN EASTER POEM,"Now to God, my Father—"
11021,AN EASTER POEM,Mine and yours—I go;
11022,AN EASTER POEM,And because I live
11023,AN EASTER POEM,Ye shall live also!”
11024,AN EASTER POEM,
11025,AN EASTER POEM,Didst thou grasp the meaning?
11026,AN EASTER POEM,Know that Death was dead?
11027,AN EASTER POEM,That the seed of woman
11028,AN EASTER POEM,Had bruised the serpent’s head?
11029,AN EASTER POEM,
11030,AN EASTER POEM,Didst thou know Messiah
11031,AN EASTER POEM,"The gates of hell had broken,"
11032,AN EASTER POEM,And life unto its captives
11033,AN EASTER POEM,Once for all had spoken?
11034,AN EASTER POEM,
11035,AN EASTER POEM,"O! through all the ages,"
11036,AN EASTER POEM,"Every son of man,"
11037,AN EASTER POEM,"Be he slave or monarch,"
11038,AN EASTER POEM,Born to bliss or ban—
11039,AN EASTER POEM,
11040,AN EASTER POEM,"Lord, or prince, or peasant,"
11041,AN EASTER POEM,"Jester, sage, or seer,"
11042,AN EASTER POEM,"Wife, or child, or mother,"
11043,AN EASTER POEM,"Priest, or worshipper—"
11044,AN EASTER POEM,
11045,AN EASTER POEM,Through the grave’s lone portals
11046,AN EASTER POEM,"Soon or late had passed,"
11047,AN EASTER POEM,But no sign or token
11048,AN EASTER POEM,Back to earth had cast!
11049,AN EASTER POEM,
11050,AN EASTER POEM,In Ramah was a voice heard
11051,AN EASTER POEM,Sounding through the years—
11052,AN EASTER POEM,Rachel for her children
11053,AN EASTER POEM,Pouring sighs and tears;
11054,AN EASTER POEM,
11055,AN EASTER POEM,Rizpah for her slain sons
11056,AN EASTER POEM,Woful vigils keeping;
11057,AN EASTER POEM,David for young Absalom
11058,AN EASTER POEM,In the chamber weeping!
11059,AN EASTER POEM,
11060,AN EASTER POEM,All earth’s myriad millions
11061,AN EASTER POEM,"To their dead had cried,"
11062,AN EASTER POEM,Empty arms outreaching
11063,AN EASTER POEM,"In the silence wide,"
11064,AN EASTER POEM,
11065,AN EASTER POEM,Yet from out the darkness
11066,AN EASTER POEM,"Came nor word, nor sound,"
11067,AN EASTER POEM,As the long ranks vanished
11068,AN EASTER POEM,In the black profound—
11069,AN EASTER POEM,
11070,AN EASTER POEM,Came no word till Mary
11071,AN EASTER POEM,Heard the Angel say—
11072,AN EASTER POEM,“Christ the Lord is risen;
11073,AN EASTER POEM,The Lord Christ lives to-day!”
11074,AN EASTER POEM,
11075,AN EASTER POEM,From the empty sepulchre
11076,AN EASTER POEM,Streamed the Light Divine;
11077,AN EASTER POEM,Grave where is thy victory?
11078,AN EASTER POEM,"Where, O Death, is thine?"
11079,AN EASTER POEM,
11080,AN EASTER POEM,"Mary Magdalenè,"
11081,AN EASTER POEM,Hope is born again;
11082,AN EASTER POEM,Clear the Day-star rises
11083,AN EASTER POEM,To the eyes of men.
11084,AN EASTER POEM,
11085,AN EASTER POEM,Lo! the mists are fleeing!
11086,AN EASTER POEM,"Shine, O Olivet,"
11087,AN EASTER POEM,For the crown of promise
11088,AN EASTER POEM,On thy brow is set!
11089,AN EASTER POEM,
11090,AN EASTER POEM,"Lift your heads, ye mountains!"
11091,AN EASTER POEM,"Clap your hands, ye hills!"
11092,AN EASTER POEM,Into rapturous singing
11093,AN EASTER POEM,"Break, ye murmuring rills!"
11094,AN EASTER POEM,
11095,AN EASTER POEM,"Shout aloud, O forests!"
11096,AN EASTER POEM,"Swell the song, O seas!"
11097,AN EASTER POEM,"Wake, resistless ocean,"
11098,AN EASTER POEM,All your symphonies!
11099,AN EASTER POEM,
11100,AN EASTER POEM,"Wave your palms, O tropics!"
11101,AN EASTER POEM,"Lonely isles, rejoice!"
11102,AN EASTER POEM,"O ye silent deserts,"
11103,AN EASTER POEM,Find a choral voice!
11104,AN EASTER POEM,
11105,AN EASTER POEM,"Winds, on mighty trumpets,"
11106,AN EASTER POEM,"Blow the strains abroad,"
11107,AN EASTER POEM,While each star in heaven
11108,AN EASTER POEM,Hails its risen Lord!
11109,AN EASTER POEM,
11110,AN EASTER POEM,“Alleluia! Alleluia!”—
11111,AN EASTER POEM,How the voices ring!
11112,AN EASTER POEM,“Alleluia! Alleluia!”
11113,AN EASTER POEM,Earth and heaven sing!
11114,AN EASTER POEM,
11115,AN EASTER POEM,Alleluia! Christ is risen!
11116,AN EASTER POEM,Chant his praise alway!

11122,THE APPLE-TREE,
11123,THE APPLE-TREE,"Graceful and lithe and tall,"
11124,THE APPLE-TREE,"It stands by the garden wall,"
11125,THE APPLE-TREE,In the flush of its pink-white bloom
11126,THE APPLE-TREE,Elate with its own perfume.
11127,THE APPLE-TREE,Tossing its young bright head
11128,THE APPLE-TREE,"In the first glad joy of May,"
11129,THE APPLE-TREE,While its singing leaves sing back
11130,THE APPLE-TREE,To the bird on the dancing spray.
11131,THE APPLE-TREE,“I’m alive! I’m abloom!” it cries
11132,THE APPLE-TREE,To the winds and the laughing skies.
11133,THE APPLE-TREE,Ho! for the gay young apple-tree
11134,THE APPLE-TREE,That stands by the garden wall!
11135,THE APPLE-TREE,
11136,THE APPLE-TREE,"Sturdy and broad and tall,"
11137,THE APPLE-TREE,Over the garden wall
11138,THE APPLE-TREE,It spreads its branches wide—
11139,THE APPLE-TREE,A bower on either side.
11140,THE APPLE-TREE,For the bending boughs hang low;
11141,THE APPLE-TREE,And with shouts and gay turmoil
11142,THE APPLE-TREE,The children gather like bees
11143,THE APPLE-TREE,To garner the golden spoil;
11144,THE APPLE-TREE,"While the smiling mother sings,"
11145,THE APPLE-TREE,“Rejoice for the gift it brings!
11146,THE APPLE-TREE,Ho! for the laden apple-tree
11147,THE APPLE-TREE,That stands by our garden wall!”
11148,THE APPLE-TREE,
11149,THE APPLE-TREE,"The strong swift years fly past,"
11150,THE APPLE-TREE,Each swifter than the last;
11151,THE APPLE-TREE,And the tree by the garden wall
11152,THE APPLE-TREE,Sees joy and grief befall.
11153,THE APPLE-TREE,Still from the spreading boughs
11154,THE APPLE-TREE,Some golden apples swing;
11155,THE APPLE-TREE,But the children come no more
11156,THE APPLE-TREE,For the autumn harvesting.
11157,THE APPLE-TREE,The tangled grass lies deep
11158,THE APPLE-TREE,Where the long path used to creep;
11159,THE APPLE-TREE,Yet ho! for the brave old apple-tree
11160,THE APPLE-TREE,That leans o’er the crumbling wall!
11161,THE APPLE-TREE,
11162,THE APPLE-TREE,"Now generations pass,"
11163,THE APPLE-TREE,Like shadows on the grass.
11164,THE APPLE-TREE,What is there that remains
11165,THE APPLE-TREE,For all their toil and pains?
11166,THE APPLE-TREE,A little hollow place
11167,THE APPLE-TREE,Where once a hearthstone lay;
11168,THE APPLE-TREE,"An empty, silent space"
11169,THE APPLE-TREE,Whence life hath gone away;
11170,THE APPLE-TREE,"Tall brambles where the lilacs grew,"
11171,THE APPLE-TREE,"Some fennel, and a clump of rue,"
11172,THE APPLE-TREE,And this one gnarled old apple-tree
11173,THE APPLE-TREE,Where once was the garden wall!

11200,THE COMFORTER,Not always thus—for thou dost stoop
11201,THE COMFORTER,"To our poor, common clay,"
11202,THE COMFORTER,"Too faint for saintly ecstasy,"
11203,THE COMFORTER,Too impotent to pray.

11206,THE COMFORTER,Ofttimes through byways dim;
11207,THE COMFORTER,Not always by the beaten path
11208,THE COMFORTER,Of sacrament and hymn;
11209,THE COMFORTER,"Not always through the gates of prayer,"
11210,THE COMFORTER,"Or penitential psalm,"
11211,THE COMFORTER,"Or sacred rite, or holy day,"
11212,THE COMFORTER,"Or incense, breathing balm."
11213,THE COMFORTER,
11214,THE COMFORTER,How does God send the Comforter?
11215,THE COMFORTER,Perchance through faith intense;
11216,THE COMFORTER,Perchance through humblest avenues
11217,THE COMFORTER,"Of sight, or sound, or sense."
11218,THE COMFORTER,Haply in childhood’s laughing voice
11219,THE COMFORTER,"Shall breathe the voice divine,"
11220,THE COMFORTER,And tender hands of earthly love
11221,THE COMFORTER,Pour for thee heavenly wine!
11222,THE COMFORTER,
11223,THE COMFORTER,How will God send the Comforter?
11224,THE COMFORTER,"Thou knowest not, nor I!"
11225,THE COMFORTER,His ways are countless as the stars
11226,THE COMFORTER,His hand hath hung on high.
11227,THE COMFORTER,"His roses bring their fragrant balm,"
11228,THE COMFORTER,"His twilight hush its peace,"
11229,THE COMFORTER,"Morning its splendor, night its calm,"
11230,THE COMFORTER,To give thy pain surcease!

11244,SANTA CLAUS,The wondering stars look out to see
11245,SANTA CLAUS,"Who he that flieth so fast may be,"
11246,SANTA CLAUS,And their bright eyes follow my earthward track
11247,SANTA CLAUS,By the gleam of the jewels I bear in my pack.
11248,SANTA CLAUS,For I have treasures for high and for low:
11249,SANTA CLAUS,Rubies that burn like the sunset glow;
11250,SANTA CLAUS,Diamond rays for the crownèd queen;
11251,SANTA CLAUS,"For the princess, pearls with their silver sheen."
11252,SANTA CLAUS,
11253,SANTA CLAUS,I enter the castle with noiseless feet—
11254,SANTA CLAUS,The air is silent and soft and sweet;
11255,SANTA CLAUS,And I lavish my beautiful tokens there—
11256,SANTA CLAUS,Fairings to make the fair more fair!
11257,SANTA CLAUS,I enter the cottage of want and woe—
11258,SANTA CLAUS,"The candle is out, and the fire burns low;"
11259,SANTA CLAUS,But the sleepers smile in a happy dream
11260,SANTA CLAUS,As I scatter my gifts by the moon’s pale beam.
11261,SANTA CLAUS,
11262,SANTA CLAUS,"There’s never a home so low, no doubt,"

11264,SANTA CLAUS,Nor a hut so hidden but I can see
11265,SANTA CLAUS,The shadow cast by the lone roof-tree!
11266,SANTA CLAUS,There’s never a home so proud and high
11267,SANTA CLAUS,"That I am constrained to pass it by,"
11268,SANTA CLAUS,Nor a heart so happy it may not be
11269,SANTA CLAUS,Happier still when blessed by me!
11270,SANTA CLAUS,
11271,SANTA CLAUS,"What is my name? Ah, who can tell,"
11272,SANTA CLAUS,Though in every land ’tis a magic spell!

11287,A BALLAD OF 1775,"In the heart of a forest old and gray,"
11288,A BALLAD OF 1775,Castleton slept one Sabbath day—
11289,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Slept and dreamed, on the seventh of May,"
11290,A BALLAD OF 1775,Seventeen hundred and seventy-five.
11291,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11292,A BALLAD OF 1775,"But hark! a humming, like bees in a hive;"
11293,A BALLAD OF 1775,Hark to the shouts—“They come! they come!”
11294,A BALLAD OF 1775,Hark to the sound of the fife and drum!
11295,A BALLAD OF 1775,For up from the south two hundred men—
11296,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Two hundred and fifty—from mount and glen,"
11297,A BALLAD OF 1775,While the deep woods rang with their rallying cry
11298,A BALLAD OF 1775,Of “Ticonderoga! Fort Ti! Fort Ti!”
11299,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Swept into the town with a martial tread,"
11300,A BALLAD OF 1775,Ethan Allen marching ahead!
11301,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11302,A BALLAD OF 1775,Next day the village was all astir
11303,A BALLAD OF 1775,With unwonted tumult and hurry. There were
11304,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Gatherings here and gatherings there,"
11305,A BALLAD OF 1775,"A feverish heat in the very air,"
11306,A BALLAD OF 1775,"The ominous sound of tramping feet,"
11307,A BALLAD OF 1775,And eager groups in the dusty street.
11308,A BALLAD OF 1775,To Eben’s forge strode Gershom Beach
11309,A BALLAD OF 1775,"(Idle it stood, and its master away);"
11310,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Blacksmith and armorer stout was he,"
11311,A BALLAD OF 1775,"First in the fight and first in the breach,"
11312,A BALLAD OF 1775,And first in work where a man should be.
11313,A BALLAD OF 1775,"“I’ll borrow your tools, my friend,” he said,"
11314,A BALLAD OF 1775,“And temper these blades if I lose my head!”
11315,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11316,A BALLAD OF 1775,"So he wrought away till the sun went down,"
11317,A BALLAD OF 1775,And silence fell on the turbulent town;
11318,A BALLAD OF 1775,"And the flame of the forge through the darkness glowed,"
11319,A BALLAD OF 1775,A square of light on the sandy road.
11320,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Then over the threshold a shadow fell,"
11321,A BALLAD OF 1775,And he heard a voice that he knew right well.
11322,A BALLAD OF 1775,It was Ethan Allen’s. He cried: “I knew
11323,A BALLAD OF 1775,Where the forge-fire blazed I must look for you!
11324,A BALLAD OF 1775,"But listen! more arduous work than this,"
11325,A BALLAD OF 1775,Lying in wait for someone is;
11326,A BALLAD OF 1775,And tempering blades is only play
11327,A BALLAD OF 1775,To the task I set for him this day—
11328,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Or this night, rather.” A grim smile played"
11329,A BALLAD OF 1775,O’er the armorer’s face as his hand he stayed.
11330,A BALLAD OF 1775,"“Say on. I never have shirked,” said he;"
11331,A BALLAD OF 1775,“What may this wonderful task-work be?”
11332,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11333,A BALLAD OF 1775,“To go by the light of the evening star
11334,A BALLAD OF 1775,"On an urgent errand, swift and far—"
11335,A BALLAD OF 1775,From town to town and from farm to farm
11336,A BALLAD OF 1775,To carry the warning and sound the alarm!
11337,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Wake Rutland and Pittsford! Rouse Neshobè, too,"
11338,A BALLAD OF 1775,And all the fair valley the Otter runs through—
11339,A BALLAD OF 1775,"For we need more men! Make no delay,"
11340,A BALLAD OF 1775,"But hasten, hasten, upon your way!”"
11341,A BALLAD OF 1775,"He doffed his apron, he tightened his belt,"
11342,A BALLAD OF 1775,To fasten the straps of his leggings he knelt.
11343,A BALLAD OF 1775,"“Ere the clock strikes nine,” said Gershom Beach,"
11344,A BALLAD OF 1775,"“Friend Allen, I will be out of reach;"
11345,A BALLAD OF 1775,"And I pledge you my word, ere dawn of day"
11346,A BALLAD OF 1775,Guns and men shall be under way.
11347,A BALLAD OF 1775,But where shall I send these minute-men?”
11348,A BALLAD OF 1775,"“Do you know Hand’s Cove?” said Allen then,"
11349,A BALLAD OF 1775,“On the shore of Champlain? Let them meet me there
11350,A BALLAD OF 1775,"By to-morrow night, be it foul or fair!”"
11351,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11352,A BALLAD OF 1775,"“Good-by, I’m off!” Then down the road"
11353,A BALLAD OF 1775,"As if on seven-league boots he strode,"
11354,A BALLAD OF 1775,While Allen watched from the forge’s door
11355,A BALLAD OF 1775,Till the stalwart form he could see no more.
11356,A BALLAD OF 1775,Into the woods passed Gershom Beach;
11357,A BALLAD OF 1775,By nine of the clock he was out of reach.
11358,A BALLAD OF 1775,"But still, as his will his steps outran,"
11359,A BALLAD OF 1775,"He said to himself, with a laugh, “Old man,"
11360,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Never a minute have you to lose,"
11361,A BALLAD OF 1775,Never a minute to pick or choose;
11362,A BALLAD OF 1775,For sixty miles in twenty-four hours
11363,A BALLAD OF 1775,Is surely enough to try your powers.
11364,A BALLAD OF 1775,So square your shoulders and speed away
11365,A BALLAD OF 1775,With never a halt by night or day.”
11366,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11367,A BALLAD OF 1775,’Twas a moonless night; but over his head
11368,A BALLAD OF 1775,"The stars a tremulous lustre shed,"
11369,A BALLAD OF 1775,"And the breath of the woods grew strangely sweet,"
11370,A BALLAD OF 1775,"As he crushed the wild ferns under his feet,"
11371,A BALLAD OF 1775,"And trampled the shy arbutus blooms,"
11372,A BALLAD OF 1775,With their hoarded wealth of rare perfumes.
11373,A BALLAD OF 1775,He sniffed as he went. “It seems to me
11374,A BALLAD OF 1775,"There are May-flowers here, but I cannot see."
11375,A BALLAD OF 1775,I’ve read of the ‘hush of the silent night’;
11376,A BALLAD OF 1775,Now hark! there’s a wolf on yonder height;
11377,A BALLAD OF 1775,There’s a snarling catamount prowling round;
11378,A BALLAD OF 1775,Every inch of the ‘silence’ is full of sound;
11379,A BALLAD OF 1775,The night-birds cry; the whip-poor-wills
11380,A BALLAD OF 1775,Call to each other from all the hills;
11381,A BALLAD OF 1775,A scream comes down from the eagle’s nest;
11382,A BALLAD OF 1775,The bark of a fox from the cliff’s tall crest;
11383,A BALLAD OF 1775,The owls hoot; and the very trees
11384,A BALLAD OF 1775,Have something to say to every breeze!”
11385,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11386,A BALLAD OF 1775,The paths were few and the ways were rude
11387,A BALLAD OF 1775,In the depths of that virgin solitude.
11388,A BALLAD OF 1775,"The Indian’s trail and the hunter’s tracks,"
11389,A BALLAD OF 1775,"The trees scarred deep by the settler’s axe,"
11390,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Or a cow-path leading to the creek,—"
11391,A BALLAD OF 1775,These were the signs he had to seek;
11392,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Save where, it may be, he chanced to hit"
11393,A BALLAD OF 1775,The Crown Point road and could follow it—
11394,A BALLAD OF 1775,The road by the British troops hewn out
11395,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Under General Amherst in fifty-nine,"
11396,A BALLAD OF 1775,"When he drove the French from the old redoubt,"
11397,A BALLAD OF 1775,Nor waited to give the countersign!
11398,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11399,A BALLAD OF 1775,The streams were many and swift and clear;
11400,A BALLAD OF 1775,"But there was no bridge, or far or near."
11401,A BALLAD OF 1775,It was midnight when he paused to hear
11402,A BALLAD OF 1775,"At Rutland, the roar of the waterfall,"
11403,A BALLAD OF 1775,"And found a canoe by the river’s edge,"
11404,A BALLAD OF 1775,In a tangled thicket of reeds and sedge.
11405,A BALLAD OF 1775,"With a shout and a cheer, on the rushing tide"
11406,A BALLAD OF 1775,He launched it and flew to the other side;
11407,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Then giving his message, on he sped,"
11408,A BALLAD OF 1775,"By the light of the pale stars overhead,"
11409,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Past the log church below Pine Hill,"
11410,A BALLAD OF 1775,"And the graveyard opposite. All was still,"
11411,A BALLAD OF 1775,And the one lone sleeper lying there
11412,A BALLAD OF 1775,Stirred not either for cry or prayer.
11413,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11414,A BALLAD OF 1775,Only pausing to give the alarm
11415,A BALLAD OF 1775,At rude log cabin and lonely farm.
11416,A BALLAD OF 1775,"From hamlet to hamlet he hurries along,"
11417,A BALLAD OF 1775,Borne on by a purpose deep and strong.
11418,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Look! there’s a deer in the forest glade,"
11419,A BALLAD OF 1775,Stealing along like a silent shade!
11420,A BALLAD OF 1775,Hark to the loon that cries and moans
11421,A BALLAD OF 1775,With a living grief in its human tones!
11422,A BALLAD OF 1775,At Pittsford the light begins to grow
11423,A BALLAD OF 1775,"In the wakening east; and drifting slow,"
11424,A BALLAD OF 1775,"From valley and river and wild-wood, rise,"
11425,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Like the smoke of a morning sacrifice,"
11426,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Clouds of translucent, silver mist,"
11427,A BALLAD OF 1775,Flushing to rose and amethyst;
11428,A BALLAD OF 1775,While thrush and robin and bluebird sing
11429,A BALLAD OF 1775,Till the woods with jubilant music ring!
11430,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11431,A BALLAD OF 1775,"It was day at last! He looked around,"
11432,A BALLAD OF 1775,With a firmer tread on the springing ground;
11433,A BALLAD OF 1775,"“Now the men will be all afield,” said he,"
11434,A BALLAD OF 1775,“And that will save many a step for me.
11435,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Each man will be ready to go; but still,"
11436,A BALLAD OF 1775,"I must confess, if I’d had my will,"
11437,A BALLAD OF 1775,"I’d have waited till after planting-time,"
11438,A BALLAD OF 1775,For now the season is in its prime.
11439,A BALLAD OF 1775,The young green leaves of the oak-tree here
11440,A BALLAD OF 1775,Are just the size of a squirrel’s ear;
11441,A BALLAD OF 1775,"And I’ve known no rule, since I was born,"
11442,A BALLAD OF 1775,Safer than that for planting corn!”
11443,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11444,A BALLAD OF 1775,"He threaded the valleys, he climbed the hills,"
11445,A BALLAD OF 1775,"He forded the rivers, he leaped the rills,"
11446,A BALLAD OF 1775,"While still to his call, like minute-men"
11447,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Booted and spurred, from mount and glen,"
11448,A BALLAD OF 1775,The settlers rallied. But on he went
11449,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Like an arrow shot from a bow, unspent,"
11450,A BALLAD OF 1775,Down the long vale of the Otter to where
11451,A BALLAD OF 1775,The might of the waterfall thundered in air;
11452,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Then across to the lake, six leagues and more,"
11453,A BALLAD OF 1775,Where Hand’s Cove lay in the bending shore.
11454,A BALLAD OF 1775,The goal was reached. He dropped to the ground
11455,A BALLAD OF 1775,"In a deep ravine, without word or sound;"
11456,A BALLAD OF 1775,"And Sleep, the restorer, bade him rest"
11457,A BALLAD OF 1775,"Like a weary child, on the earth’s brown breast."
11458,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11459,A BALLAD OF 1775,"At midnight he woke with a quick heart-beat,"
11460,A BALLAD OF 1775,And sprang with a will to his throbbing feet;—
11461,A BALLAD OF 1775,"For armed men swarmed in the dim ravine,"
11462,A BALLAD OF 1775,"And Ethan Allen, as proud of mien"
11463,A BALLAD OF 1775,"As a king on his throne, smiled down on him,"
11464,A BALLAD OF 1775,While he stretched and straightened each stiffened limb.
11465,A BALLAD OF 1775,"“Nay, nay,” said the Colonel, “take your rest,"
11466,A BALLAD OF 1775,As a knight who has done his chief’s behest!”
11467,A BALLAD OF 1775,
11468,A BALLAD OF 1775,“Not yet!” cried the armorer. “Where’s my gun?
11469,A BALLAD OF 1775,A knight fights on till the field is won!”
11470,A BALLAD OF 1775,"And into Fort Ti, ere dawn of day,"
11471,A BALLAD OF 1775,He stormed with his comrades to share the fray!

12142,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Passed over the summer day—
12143,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"A thrill, and a nameless dread,"
12144,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,As of one who waits alone

12147,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,
12148,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,For before my shrinking eyes

12153,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"With blood-stained garments on,"
12154,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"Reckless of praise or blame,"
12155,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Or battles lost or won.

12158,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,And paused at the Traitors’ Gate;

12160,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Forerunner of deadly fate?
12161,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"Lo! up the stairs from the river,"

12168,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,And mien of one who claims
12169,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Close kindred with despair!
12170,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"And some were proud and cold,"
12171,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"With eyes that blazed like stars,"
12172,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,As under that archway old
12173,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,They passed to their prison-bars.
12174,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,
12175,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,To prison-bars or death!
12176,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"Fair, hapless Anne Boleyn;"

12185,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Frowned as I onward went;
12186,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,The Bloody Tower is this—
12187,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Strong tower of dread portent!
12188,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"“Show me the Princes’ Chamber,”"
12189,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,To the Yeoman Guard I said;

12195,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,No wail of expectant doom
12196,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"Echoed alow, aloof!"
12197,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,But instead a mother sang
12198,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"To a child upon her knee,"
12199,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Whose peals of laughter rang
12200,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Like sweet bells mad with glee.
12201,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,
12202,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"Sunshine for murky air,"
12203,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"Smiles for the sob of pain,"

12205,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Hope where sweet hope was slain!
12206,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"“Art thou happy here,” I cried,"
12207,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"“Where once was lonely woe,"
12208,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"And the royal children died,—"
12209,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Murdered so long ago?”
12210,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,
12211,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"She smiled. “O, lady, yes!"
12212,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Earth hath forgotten them;
12213,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"See how my roses press,"
12214,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,Blooming on each fair stem!
12215,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"The princes, they sleep sound,"
12216,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,But love nor joy are dead;
12217,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"I fear no haunted ground,"
12218,THE PRINCES’ CHAMBER,"I have my child,” she said."

12377,NOCTURNE,"O lone, sweet spirit! tell me why"
12378,NOCTURNE,"So far thy ringing love-notes fly,"
12379,NOCTURNE,"While other birds, hushed by the dark,"
12380,NOCTURNE,Are mute as I?
12381,NOCTURNE,
12382,NOCTURNE,No prophecy of morn is nigh;
12383,NOCTURNE,"Yet as the sombre hours glide by,"
12384,NOCTURNE,Bravely thou singest in the dark—
12385,NOCTURNE,Why sing not I?
12386,NOCTURNE,
12387,NOCTURNE,
12388,COME WHAT MAY,COME WHAT MAY
12389,COME WHAT MAY,
12390,COME WHAT MAY,Come what may—
12391,COME WHAT MAY,"Though what remaineth I may not know,"
12392,COME WHAT MAY,Nor how many times the rose may blow
12393,COME WHAT MAY,"For my delight, or whether the years"
12394,COME WHAT MAY,"Shall be set to the chime of falling tears,"
12395,COME WHAT MAY,Or go on their way rejoicing—
12396,COME WHAT MAY,"Yet, come what may,"
12397,COME WHAT MAY,I have had my day!
12398,COME WHAT MAY,
12399,COME WHAT MAY,Come what may—
12400,COME WHAT MAY,"The lurid storm or the sunset peace,"
12401,COME WHAT MAY,"The lingering pain or the swift release,"
12402,COME WHAT MAY,"Lonely vigils and watchings long,"
12403,COME WHAT MAY,"Passionate prayer or soaring song,"
12404,COME WHAT MAY,Or silence deep and golden—
12405,COME WHAT MAY,"Still, come what may,"
12406,COME WHAT MAY,I have had my day!
12407,COME WHAT MAY,
12408,COME WHAT MAY,"Come what may,"
12409,COME WHAT MAY,"I have known the fiery heart of youth,"
12410,COME WHAT MAY,"Its rapturous joy, its bitter ruth;"
12411,COME WHAT MAY,"I have felt the thrill of the eager doer,"
12412,COME WHAT MAY,"The quick heart-throb of the swift pursuer,"
12413,COME WHAT MAY,The flush of glad possession—
12414,COME WHAT MAY,"And, come what may,"
12415,COME WHAT MAY,I have had my day!
12416,COME WHAT MAY,
12417,COME WHAT MAY,"Come what may,"
12418,COME WHAT MAY,I have learned that out of the night is born
12419,COME WHAT MAY,The mystic flower of the early morn;
12420,COME WHAT MAY,I have learned that after the frost of pain
12421,COME WHAT MAY,"The lily of peace will bloom again,"
12422,COME WHAT MAY,And the rose of consolation.
12423,COME WHAT MAY,"Then, come what may,"
12424,COME WHAT MAY,I have had my day!

12428,NUREMBERG,
12429,NUREMBERG,"Over the wide, tumultuous sea"
12430,NUREMBERG,"In trancèd hours I dream of thee,"
12431,NUREMBERG,"Ancient city of song and myth,"
12432,NUREMBERG,"Whose name is a name to conjure with,"
12433,NUREMBERG,"And make the heart throb, Nuremberg!"
12434,NUREMBERG,
12435,NUREMBERG,I see thee fair in the white moonlight;
12436,NUREMBERG,"The stars are asleep at noon of night,"
12437,NUREMBERG,Save one that between St. Lawrence’ spires
12438,NUREMBERG,Kindles aloft its silver fires—
12439,NUREMBERG,"A flaming cresset, Nuremberg!"
12440,NUREMBERG,
12441,NUREMBERG,Leaning over thy river’s brim
12442,NUREMBERG,"Crowd the red roofs and oriels dim,"
12443,NUREMBERG,While under its bridges glide and gleam
12444,NUREMBERG,"The rippling waves of a silent stream,"
12445,NUREMBERG,"Sparkling and darkling, Nuremberg!"
12446,NUREMBERG,
12447,NUREMBERG,"Oh, the charm of each haunted street,"
12448,NUREMBERG,Ways where Beauty and Duty meet;
12449,NUREMBERG,Sculptured miracles soaring free
12450,NUREMBERG,"In temple and mart for all to see,"
12451,NUREMBERG,"Wherever the light falls, Nuremberg!"
12452,NUREMBERG,
12453,NUREMBERG,"Even thy beggars lift their eyes,"
12454,NUREMBERG,Finding ever some new surprise;
12455,NUREMBERG,"Even thy children pause from play,"
12456,NUREMBERG,"To hear what thy graven marbles say,"
12457,NUREMBERG,"Thy myriad voices, Nuremberg!"
12458,NUREMBERG,
12459,NUREMBERG,Other cities for crown and king
12460,NUREMBERG,"Wide their glorious banners fling,"
12461,NUREMBERG,Lifting high on the azure field
12462,NUREMBERG,"Blazoned trophies of sword and shield,"
12463,NUREMBERG,"That pierce the far skies, Nuremberg!"
12464,NUREMBERG,
12465,NUREMBERG,"But thou, O city of old renown,"
12466,NUREMBERG,Thou dost painter and sculptor crown;
12467,NUREMBERG,"Thou dost give to the poet bays,"
12468,NUREMBERG,Immortelles for the deathless lays
12469,NUREMBERG,"Chanted for thee, fair Nuremberg!"
12470,NUREMBERG,
12471,NUREMBERG,"They are thy Lords of High Degree,"
12472,NUREMBERG,"Marvels of art who wrought for thee,"
12473,NUREMBERG,Toiling on with tireless will
12474,NUREMBERG,Till the wondrous hands in death were still.
12475,NUREMBERG,"Being dead, they yet speak, Nuremberg!"
12476,NUREMBERG,
12477,NUREMBERG,They were dust and ashes long ago;
12478,NUREMBERG,Over their graves the sweet winds blow;
12479,NUREMBERG,Yet they are alive whom men call dead—
12480,NUREMBERG,"This is thy spell, when all is said;"
12481,NUREMBERG,"This is thy glory, Nuremberg!"

12484,A MATER DOLOROSA,A MATER DOLOROSA
12485,A MATER DOLOROSA,
12486,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Then down the street came Giacomo, flushed"
12487,A MATER DOLOROSA,"With wine and laughter. I can see him now,"
12488,A MATER DOLOROSA,"With Giulio, Florian, and young Angelo,"
12489,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Arms interlaced, hands clasped, a roisterous crew"
12490,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Of merry, harmless idlers. Ah, so long,"
12491,A MATER DOLOROSA,So long ago it was! Yet I can see
12492,A MATER DOLOROSA,Just how the campanile shone that night
12493,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Like molten silver, while its carven saints"
12494,A MATER DOLOROSA,Prayed in the moonlight. Then a shadow crept
12495,A MATER DOLOROSA,Over the moon’s face; and it grew so dark
12496,A MATER DOLOROSA,That the red star in Giacomo’s cap
12497,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Paled and went out, and Giulio’s shoulder-clasp"
12498,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Lost all the lustre of its burnished gold,"
12499,A MATER DOLOROSA,"And faded out of sight. Strange, how we lose"
12500,A MATER DOLOROSA,"So much we would remember, and yet keep"
12501,A MATER DOLOROSA,Trifles like this until the day of doom!
12502,A MATER DOLOROSA,They had swept past me where I stood in shade
12503,A MATER DOLOROSA,When Giacomo turned. Just then the moon
12504,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Shone out again, illumining the place,"
12505,A MATER DOLOROSA,"And he paused laughing, catching sight of me"
12506,A MATER DOLOROSA,"There by the fountain.—Nay, sweet Signor, nay!"
12507,A MATER DOLOROSA,"I was young then, and some said I was fair;"
12508,A MATER DOLOROSA,"But I loved not Giacomo, nor he me.—"
12509,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Back he came crying, “Little one, take heed!"
12510,A MATER DOLOROSA,Know you Fra Alessandro? He would have
12511,A MATER DOLOROSA,A model for his picture. Go you then
12512,A MATER DOLOROSA,To-morrow to his studio and say
12513,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Giacomo sent you. At the convent there,"
12514,A MATER DOLOROSA,Near Santa Croce.”
12515,A MATER DOLOROSA,So I thither went
12516,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Early next morning, trembling as I stole"
12517,A MATER DOLOROSA,Into the master’s presence. A grave man
12518,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Of most unworldly aspect, with bowed head"
12519,A MATER DOLOROSA,"And pale chin resting on his long, thin hand,"
12520,A MATER DOLOROSA,"He sat before an easel, lost in thought."
12521,A MATER DOLOROSA,"“Giacomo sent me,” said I, creeping in,"
12522,A MATER DOLOROSA,"And then stood breathless. Swift as light he turned,"
12523,A MATER DOLOROSA,"But smiled not, spoke not, while his searching eye"
12524,A MATER DOLOROSA,"For minutes that seemed hours scanned my face,"
12525,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Reading it line by line. Signor, it seemed"
12526,A MATER DOLOROSA,"As if the judgment-day had come, and God"
12527,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Sat on the great white throne! At length he spoke,"
12528,A MATER DOLOROSA,Nodding as one content—“To-morrow morn
12529,A MATER DOLOROSA,I pray thee come thou hither. Canst thou bring
12530,A MATER DOLOROSA,"A little child with thee—some fair, sweet child"
12531,A MATER DOLOROSA,Whose eyes are like the morning?”
12532,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Then I said,"
12533,A MATER DOLOROSA,Bethinking me of Beppo’s little boy
12534,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Whose mother died last week—“Yes, I will come"
12535,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Surely, my father, and will bring with me"
12536,A MATER DOLOROSA,"The fairest child in Florence.” “It is well,”"
12537,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Softly he answered, and a sudden light"
12538,A MATER DOLOROSA,Made his pale face all glorious. At the door
12539,A MATER DOLOROSA,"I paused, and looking backward saw him bow"
12540,A MATER DOLOROSA,Before the easel as before a shrine.
12541,A MATER DOLOROSA,"I know not if he prayed, but never saint"
12542,A MATER DOLOROSA,Had aspect more divine.
12543,A MATER DOLOROSA,Next day I went
12544,A MATER DOLOROSA,With little Nello to the studio.
12545,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Impatiently the Frate greeted us,"
12546,A MATER DOLOROSA,Palette in hand. “So!—Thou art come at last?”
12547,A MATER DOLOROSA,But as I drew the cap from Nello’s head
12548,A MATER DOLOROSA,And the moist tendrils of his golden hair
12549,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Fell softly on his forehead, he cried out:"
12550,A MATER DOLOROSA,"“The boy is like an angel! And thy face,"
12551,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Thy face, my daughter, I have seen in dreams,"
12552,A MATER DOLOROSA,"But in dreams only. So, then, stand thou there,"
12553,A MATER DOLOROSA,"And let the boy sit throned upon thine arm,"
12554,A MATER DOLOROSA,"As thus, or thus.”"
12555,A MATER DOLOROSA,The child was half afraid;
12556,A MATER DOLOROSA,"And round my neck he clasped his clinging arms,"
12557,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Lifting his face to mine, a questioning face,"
12558,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Filled with soft, startled wonder. While I held"
12559,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Him close and soothed him, Alessandro cried,"
12560,A MATER DOLOROSA,"“O, hold him thus forever! Do not stir!"
12561,A MATER DOLOROSA,I paint a virgin for an altar-piece.
12562,A MATER DOLOROSA,And thou and this fair child——”
12563,A MATER DOLOROSA,Even while he spoke
12564,A MATER DOLOROSA,He turned back to the easel; but I sprang
12565,A MATER DOLOROSA,"From the low pedestal, and, with the boy"
12566,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Still in my arms, I fell down at his feet."
12567,A MATER DOLOROSA,"“Not that, not that, my father!” swift I cried,"
12568,A MATER DOLOROSA,While my hot forehead touched his garment’s hem;
12569,A MATER DOLOROSA,"“Not that, for God’s sake! Paint me otherwise."
12570,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Paint me as martyr, or as Magdalen,"
12571,A MATER DOLOROSA,"As saint, or sibyl—whatsoe’er you will,"
12572,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Only not that, not that!”"
12573,A MATER DOLOROSA,Smiling he stooped
12574,A MATER DOLOROSA,"And raised me from the ground, and took the child"
12575,A MATER DOLOROSA,"In unaccustomed arms all tenderly,"
12576,A MATER DOLOROSA,Placing his brown beads in the dimpled hand.
12577,A MATER DOLOROSA,"“But why ‘not that,’ my daughter? Nothing else"
12578,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Ever paint I! Not saint, nor Magdalen,"
12579,A MATER DOLOROSA,Only the Virgin and her Holy Child.”
12580,A MATER DOLOROSA,Then suddenly I saw it all—the light
12581,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Dim in cathedral aisles, the kneeling crowds,"
12582,A MATER DOLOROSA,"The swinging censers, candles burning clear,"
12583,A MATER DOLOROSA,"With flash of jewels, splendor and perfume,"
12584,A MATER DOLOROSA,"The high white altar, and above a face,"
12585,A MATER DOLOROSA,"_My_ face, pale shining through the scented gloom"
12586,A MATER DOLOROSA,Like a lone star! Then in the hush a voice
12587,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Chanted “Hail, Mary”—and my heart stood still."
12588,A MATER DOLOROSA,"I who had been a sinner, could I dare"
12589,A MATER DOLOROSA,Thus to mock God and man? Low at his feet
12590,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Again I fell, and there I told him all"
12591,A MATER DOLOROSA,"As he had been my soul’s confessor, poured"
12592,A MATER DOLOROSA,"My very heart out. Signor, life is hard"
12593,A MATER DOLOROSA,"And cruel to child-women, when the street"
12594,A MATER DOLOROSA,Is their sole nursing mother. I had had
12595,A MATER DOLOROSA,"No friend, no home, save when old Barbara"
12596,A MATER DOLOROSA,In some rare mood of pity let me creep
12597,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Under her wing for shelter. Then she died,"
12598,A MATER DOLOROSA,And even that poor semblance of a home
12599,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Was mine no longer. Yet, as the years went on,"
12600,A MATER DOLOROSA,Out of the dust and moil I grew as tall
12601,A MATER DOLOROSA,"And fair as lily in a garden plot,"
12602,A MATER DOLOROSA,Shut in by ivied cloisters—Let it pass!—
12603,A MATER DOLOROSA,God knows how girls are tempted when false love
12604,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Comes with beguiling words and tender lips,"
12605,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Promising all things, and their barren lives"
12606,A MATER DOLOROSA,Break into sudden bloom as when a bud
12607,A MATER DOLOROSA,Unfolds its shining petals in the sun
12608,A MATER DOLOROSA,And joys to be a rose!
12609,A MATER DOLOROSA,"No word he spake,"
12610,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Fra Alessandro, sitting mute and pale."
12611,A MATER DOLOROSA,"But Nello, wondering at my sighs and tears,"
12612,A MATER DOLOROSA,Dropped the brown rosary and thrust his hands
12613,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Into the shining masses of my hair,"
12614,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Pulling the bodkin out, and lifted up"
12615,A MATER DOLOROSA,"My wet, wan face to kiss it. God is good;"
12616,A MATER DOLOROSA,And even in that dark hour a thrill of joy
12617,A MATER DOLOROSA,Ran through my soul as the pure lips met mine.
12618,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Still I knelt, waiting judgment, with the child"
12619,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Clasped to my bosom, daring not to raise"
12620,A MATER DOLOROSA,My eyes to the face above me. Well I knew
12621,A MATER DOLOROSA,"It was the priest’s face, not the painter’s, now!"
12622,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Was it his voice that through the silence stole,"
12623,A MATER DOLOROSA,"“A little child shall lead them,” murmuring low?"
12624,A MATER DOLOROSA,Just for one instant on my head a hand
12625,A MATER DOLOROSA,Fell as in benediction. Then he said
12626,A MATER DOLOROSA,"“Arise, my daughter, and come thou with me"
12627,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Where bide the holy sisters of St. Clare,"
12628,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Ruled by their abbess, saintliest of all"
12629,A MATER DOLOROSA,"The saintly sisterhood. By work and prayer,"
12630,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Fasting and penance, thou shalt purge thy soul"
12631,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Of all iniquity, and make it clean.”"
12632,A MATER DOLOROSA,Startled I answered him—“But who will care
12633,A MATER DOLOROSA,"For Nello then? His mother died last week,"
12634,A MATER DOLOROSA,And Beppo’s heart is buried in her grave—
12635,A MATER DOLOROSA,"He cares not for the child, nor gives him love.”"
12636,A MATER DOLOROSA,But with a wide sweep of his beckoning arm
12637,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Down the long cloisters strode he, and across"
12638,A MATER DOLOROSA,"The heated pavement of the market-place,"
12639,A MATER DOLOROSA,Nor looked to see if we were following him
12640,A MATER DOLOROSA,Until he paused before the convent gate;
12641,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Then rang the bell, and in the pause I heard"
12642,A MATER DOLOROSA,"The sisters chanting, and grew faint with shame."
12643,A MATER DOLOROSA,"“Fear not, my child,” Fra Alessandro said."
12644,A MATER DOLOROSA,"“Here comes Jacinta. Go you in with her,"
12645,A MATER DOLOROSA,And straightway tell the abbess all the tale
12646,A MATER DOLOROSA,Told unto me this day. Farewell! ”The gate
12647,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Swung to with iron clang, and Nello’s arms"
12648,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Half strangled me as round my neck he clung,"
12649,A MATER DOLOROSA,Awed by the holy stillness.
12650,A MATER DOLOROSA,Since that hour
12651,A MATER DOLOROSA,I with the humble sisters of St. Clare
12652,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Have given myself to deeds of mercy, works"
12653,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Meet for repentance, ministering still"
12654,A MATER DOLOROSA,"Unto all souls that suffer, even as now"
12655,A MATER DOLOROSA,I minister to you.
12656,A MATER DOLOROSA,"But what, you ask,"
12657,A MATER DOLOROSA,Of the boy Nello? Beppo died that year—
12658,A MATER DOLOROSA,God rest his soul!—and the child ’bode with us.
12659,A MATER DOLOROSA,But when the lad drew nigh to man’s estate—
12660,A MATER DOLOROSA,Too old for women’s guidance—he was found
12661,A MATER DOLOROSA,Oftener than elsewhere at the studio
12662,A MATER DOLOROSA,Of old Fra Alessandro. He became
12663,A MATER DOLOROSA,"A painter, Signor, and men call him great."
12664,A MATER DOLOROSA,I know not if he is—but you can see
12665,A MATER DOLOROSA,His pictures yonder in San Spirito.
12666,A MATER DOLOROSA,You’ve seen them? seen my face there? now you know
12667,A MATER DOLOROSA,Whence comes the semblance that has puzzled you
12668,A MATER DOLOROSA,Through all these weeks of languor?
12669,A MATER DOLOROSA,It may be.
12670,A MATER DOLOROSA,"I am too old to care now, have outlived"
12671,A MATER DOLOROSA,Youth and its petty consciousness. My face
12672,A MATER DOLOROSA,Is mine no longer. It is God’s alone.
12673,A MATER DOLOROSA,A Mater Dolorosa?—It is well!
