45,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,
46,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"A beautiful and happy girl,"
47,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"With step as light as summer air,"
48,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Eyes glad with smiles, and brow of pearl,"
49,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Shadowed by many a careless curl
50,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Of unconfined and flowing hair;
51,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"A seeming child in everything,"
52,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Save thoughtful brow and ripening charms,"
53,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,As Nature wears the smile of Spring
54,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,When sinking into Summer's arms.
55,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,
56,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,A mind rejoicing in the light
57,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Which melted through its graceful bower,"
58,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Leaf after leaf, dew-moist and bright,"
59,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"And stainless in its holy white,"
60,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Unfolding like a morning flower
61,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"A heart, which, like a fine-toned lute,"
62,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"With every breath of feeling woke,"
63,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"And, even when the tongue was mute,"
64,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,From eye and lip in music spoke.
65,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,
66,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,How thrills once more the lengthening chain
67,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Of memory, at the thought of thee!"
68,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Old hopes which long in dust have lain
69,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Old dreams, come thronging back again,"
70,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,And boyhood lives again in me;
71,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"I feel its glow upon my cheek,"
72,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Its fulness of the heart is mine,"
73,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"As when I leaned to hear thee speak,"
74,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Or raised my doubtful eye to thine.
75,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,
76,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"I hear again thy low replies,"
77,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"I feel thy arm within my own,"
78,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,And timidly again uprise
79,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"The fringed lids of hazel eyes,"
80,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,With soft brown tresses overblown.
81,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Ah! memories of sweet summer eves,"
82,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Of moonlit wave and willowy way,"
83,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Of stars and flowers, and dewy leaves,"
84,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,And smiles and tones more dear than they!
85,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,
86,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Ere this, thy quiet eye hath smiled"
87,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"My picture of thy youth to see,"
88,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"When, half a woman, half a child,"
89,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Thy very artlessness beguiled,"
90,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,And folly's self seemed wise in thee;
91,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"I too can smile, when o'er that hour"
92,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"The lights of memory backward stream,"
93,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Yet feel the while that manhood's power
94,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Is vainer than my boyhood's dream.
95,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,
96,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Years have passed on, and left their trace,"
97,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Of graver care and deeper thought;
98,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"And unto me the calm, cold face"
99,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Of manhood, and to thee the grace"
100,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Of woman's pensive beauty brought.
101,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"More wide, perchance, for blame than praise,"
102,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,The school-boy's humble name has flown;
103,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Thine, in the green and quiet ways"
104,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Of unobtrusive goodness known.
105,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,
106,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,And wider yet in thought and deed
107,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Diverge our pathways, one in youth;"
108,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Thine the Genevan's sternest creed,"
109,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,While answers to my spirit's need
110,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,The Derby dalesman's simple truth.
111,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"For thee, the priestly rite and prayer,"
112,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"And holy day, and solemn psalm;"
113,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"For me, the silent reverence where"
114,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"My brethren gather, slow and calm."
115,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,
116,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Yet hath thy spirit left on me
117,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"An impress Time has worn not out,"
118,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"And something of myself in thee,"
119,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"A shadow from the past, I see,"
120,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Lingering, even yet, thy way about;"
121,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Not wholly can the heart unlearn
122,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"That lesson of its better hours,"
123,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Not yet has Time's dull footstep worn
124,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,To common dust that path of flowers.
125,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,
126,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Thus, while at times before our eyes"
127,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"The shadows melt, and fall apart,"
128,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"And, smiling through them, round us lies"
129,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"The warm light of our morning skies,--"
130,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,The Indian Summer of the heart!
131,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"In secret sympathies of mind,"
132,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,In founts of feeling which retain
133,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,"Their pure, fresh flow, we yet may find"
134,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,Our early dreams not wholly vain
135,POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES,1841.

139,RAPHAEL.,RAPHAEL.
140,RAPHAEL.,
141,RAPHAEL.,"Suggested by the portrait of Raphael, at the age of fifteen."
142,RAPHAEL.,
143,RAPHAEL.,I shall not soon forget that sight
144,RAPHAEL.,"The glow of Autumn's westering day,"
145,RAPHAEL.,"A hazy warmth, a dreamy light,"
146,RAPHAEL.,On Raphael's picture lay.
147,RAPHAEL.,
148,RAPHAEL.,"It was a simple print I saw,"
149,RAPHAEL.,The fair face of a musing boy;
150,RAPHAEL.,"Yet, while I gazed, a sense of awe"
151,RAPHAEL.,Seemed blending with my joy.
152,RAPHAEL.,
153,RAPHAEL.,"A simple print,--the graceful flow"
154,RAPHAEL.,"Of boyhood's soft and wavy hair,"
155,RAPHAEL.,"And fresh young lip and cheek, and brow"
156,RAPHAEL.,"Unmarked and clear, were there."
157,RAPHAEL.,
158,RAPHAEL.,Yet through its sweet and calm repose
159,RAPHAEL.,I saw the inward spirit shine;
160,RAPHAEL.,It was as if before me rose
161,RAPHAEL.,The white veil of a shrine.
162,RAPHAEL.,
163,RAPHAEL.,"As if, as Gothland's sage has told,"
164,RAPHAEL.,"The hidden life, the man within,"
165,RAPHAEL.,"Dissevered from its frame and mould,"
166,RAPHAEL.,By mortal eye were seen.
167,RAPHAEL.,
168,RAPHAEL.,"Was it the lifting of that eye,"
169,RAPHAEL.,The waving of that pictured hand?
170,RAPHAEL.,"Loose as a cloud-wreath on the sky,"
171,RAPHAEL.,I saw the walls expand.
172,RAPHAEL.,
173,RAPHAEL.,"The narrow room had vanished,--space,"
174,RAPHAEL.,"Broad, luminous, remained alone,"
175,RAPHAEL.,Through which all hues and shapes of grace
176,RAPHAEL.,And beauty looked or shone.
177,RAPHAEL.,
178,RAPHAEL.,Around the mighty master came
179,RAPHAEL.,"The marvels which his pencil wrought,"
180,RAPHAEL.,Those miracles of power whose fame
181,RAPHAEL.,Is wide as human thought.
182,RAPHAEL.,
183,RAPHAEL.,"There drooped thy more than mortal face,"
184,RAPHAEL.,"O Mother, beautiful and mild"
185,RAPHAEL.,Enfolding in one dear embrace
186,RAPHAEL.,Thy Saviour and thy Child!
187,RAPHAEL.,
188,RAPHAEL.,The rapt brow of the Desert John;
189,RAPHAEL.,The awful glory of that day
190,RAPHAEL.,When all the Father's brightness shone
191,RAPHAEL.,Through manhood's veil of clay.
192,RAPHAEL.,
193,RAPHAEL.,"And, midst gray prophet forms, and wild"
194,RAPHAEL.,"Dark visions of the days of old,"
195,RAPHAEL.,How sweetly woman's beauty smiled
196,RAPHAEL.,Through locks of brown and gold!
197,RAPHAEL.,
198,RAPHAEL.,There Fornarina's fair young face
199,RAPHAEL.,"Once more upon her lover shone,"
200,RAPHAEL.,Whose model of an angel's grace
201,RAPHAEL.,He borrowed from her own.
202,RAPHAEL.,
203,RAPHAEL.,"Slow passed that vision from my view,"
204,RAPHAEL.,But not the lesson which it taught;
205,RAPHAEL.,"The soft, calm shadows which it threw"
206,RAPHAEL.,Still rested on my thought:
207,RAPHAEL.,
208,RAPHAEL.,"The truth, that painter, bard, and sage,"
209,RAPHAEL.,"Even in Earth's cold and changeful clime,"
210,RAPHAEL.,Plant for their deathless heritage
211,RAPHAEL.,The fruits and flowers of time.
212,RAPHAEL.,
213,RAPHAEL.,We shape ourselves the joy or fear
214,RAPHAEL.,"Of which the coming life is made,"
215,RAPHAEL.,And fill our Future's atmosphere
216,RAPHAEL.,With sunshine or with shade.
217,RAPHAEL.,
218,RAPHAEL.,The tissue of the Life to be
219,RAPHAEL.,"We weave with colors all our own,"
220,RAPHAEL.,And in the field of Destiny
221,RAPHAEL.,We reap as we have sown.
222,RAPHAEL.,
223,RAPHAEL.,Still shall the soul around it call
224,RAPHAEL.,"The shadows which it gathered here,"
225,RAPHAEL.,"And, painted on the eternal wall,"
226,RAPHAEL.,The Past shall reappear.
227,RAPHAEL.,
228,RAPHAEL.,Think ye the notes of holy song
229,RAPHAEL.,On Milton's tuneful ear have died?
230,RAPHAEL.,Think ye that Raphael's angel throng
231,RAPHAEL.,Has vanished from his side?
232,RAPHAEL.,
233,RAPHAEL.,Oh no!--We live our life again;
234,RAPHAEL.,"Or warmly touched, or coldly dim,"
235,RAPHAEL.,"The pictures of the Past remain,---"
236,RAPHAEL.,Man's works shall follow him!

244,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
245,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,On page of thine I cannot trace
246,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"The cold and heartless commonplace,"
247,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,A statue's fixed and marble grace.
248,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
249,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"For ever as these lines I penned,"
250,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Still with the thought of thee will blend
251,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"That of some loved and common friend,"
252,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
253,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Who in life's desert track has made
254,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"His pilgrim tent with mine, or strayed"
255,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Beneath the same remembered shade.
256,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
257,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,And hence my pen unfettered moves
258,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"In freedom which the heart approves,"
259,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,The negligence which friendship loves.
260,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
261,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,And wilt thou prize my poor gift less
262,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"For simple air and rustic dress,"
263,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,And sign of haste and carelessness?
264,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
265,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Oh, more than specious counterfeit"
266,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Of sentiment or studied wit,"
267,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,A heart like thine should value it.
268,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
269,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Yet half I fear my gift will be
270,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Unto thy book, if not to thee,"
271,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Of more than doubtful courtesy.
272,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
273,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"A banished name from Fashion's sphere,"
274,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"A lay unheard of Beauty's ear,"
275,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Forbid, disowned,--what do they here?"
276,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
277,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Upon my ear not all in vain
278,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Came the sad captive's clanking chain,"
279,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,The groaning from his bed of pain.
280,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
281,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"And sadder still, I saw the woe"
282,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Which only wounded spirits know
283,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,When Pride's strong footsteps o'er them go.
284,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
285,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Spurned not alone in walks abroad,"
286,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,But from the temples of the Lord
287,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Thrust out apart, like things abhorred."
288,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
289,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Deep as I felt, and stern and strong,"
290,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"In words which Prudence smothered long,"
291,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,My soul spoke out against the wrong;
292,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
293,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Not mine alone the task to speak
294,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Of comfort to the poor and weak,"
295,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,And dry the tear on Sorrow's cheek;
296,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
297,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"But, mingled in the conflict warm,"
298,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,To pour the fiery breath of storm
299,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Through the harsh trumpet of Reform;
300,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
301,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"To brave Opinion's settled frown,"
302,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"From ermined robe and saintly gown,"
303,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,While wrestling reverenced Error down.
304,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
305,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Founts gushed beside my pilgrim way,"
306,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Cool shadows on the greensward lay,"
307,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Flowers swung upon the bending spray.
308,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
309,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"And, broad and bright, on either hand,"
310,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Stretched the green slopes of Fairy-land,"
311,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,With Hope's eternal sunbow spanned;
312,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
313,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Whence voices called me like the flow,"
314,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Which on the listener's ear will grow,"
315,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Of forest streamlets soft and low.
316,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
317,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"And gentle eyes, which still retain"
318,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Their picture on the heart and brain,"
319,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Smiled, beckoning from that path of pain."
320,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
321,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"In vain! nor dream, nor rest, nor pause"
322,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Remain for him who round him draws
323,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,The battered mail of Freedom's cause.
324,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
325,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"From youthful hopes, from each green spot"
326,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Of young Romance, and gentle Thought,"
327,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Where storm and tumult enter not;
328,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,

335,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,To the sad Helots of our land.
336,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
337,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,What marvel then that Fame should turn
338,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Her notes of praise to those of scorn;
339,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Her gifts reclaimed, her smiles withdrawn?"
340,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
341,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"What matters it? a few years more,"
342,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Life's surge so restless heretofore
343,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Shall break upon the unknown shore!
344,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
345,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,In that far land shall disappear
346,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"The shadows which we follow here,"

353,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Alone in that great love which gave
354,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Life to the sleeper of the grave,"
355,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Resteth the power to seek and save.
356,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
357,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Yet, if the spirit gazing through"
358,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,The vista of the past can view
359,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,One deed to Heaven and virtue true;
360,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
361,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"If through the wreck of wasted powers,"
362,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Of garlands wreathed from Folly's bowers,"
363,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Of idle aims and misspent hours,"
364,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
365,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,The eye can note one sacred spot

367,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"A green place in the waste of thought,"
368,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
369,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Where deed or word hath rendered less
370,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"The sum of human wretchedness,"
371,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,And Gratitude looks forth to bless;
372,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
373,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,The simple burst of tenderest feeling
374,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"From sad hearts worn by evil-dealing,"
375,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,For blessing on the hand of healing;
376,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,

378,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"That green and blessed spot to me,"
379,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,A palm-shade in Eternity!
380,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
381,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Something of Time which may invite

383,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,To rest on with a calm delight.
384,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
385,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,And when the summer winds shall sweep
386,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"With their light wings my place of sleep,"
387,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,And mosses round my headstone creep;
388,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,

390,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Upon the young heart's altars shine
391,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,The very fires they caught from mine;
392,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
393,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"If words my lips once uttered still,"
394,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,In the calm faith and steadfast will
395,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,"Of other hearts, their work fulfil;"
396,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,
397,WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND.,Perchance with joy the soul may learn

753,MY NAMESAKE.,His faults and follies out?--
754,MY NAMESAKE.,
755,MY NAMESAKE.,"Why stuff, for fools to gaze upon,"
756,MY NAMESAKE.,"With chaff of words, the garb he wore,"
757,MY NAMESAKE.,As corn-husks when the ear is gone
758,MY NAMESAKE.,Are rustled all the more?
759,MY NAMESAKE.,
760,MY NAMESAKE.,"Let kindly Silence close again,"
761,MY NAMESAKE.,"The picture vanish from the eye,"
762,MY NAMESAKE.,And on the dim and misty main
763,MY NAMESAKE.,Let the small ripple die.
764,MY NAMESAKE.,
765,MY NAMESAKE.,Yet not the less I own your claim
766,MY NAMESAKE.,"To grateful thanks, dear friends of mine."
767,MY NAMESAKE.,"Hang, if it please you so, my name"
768,MY NAMESAKE.,Upon your household line.
769,MY NAMESAKE.,
770,MY NAMESAKE.,Let Fame from brazen lips blow wide
771,MY NAMESAKE.,"Her chosen names, I envy none"
772,MY NAMESAKE.,"A mother's love, a father's pride,"
773,MY NAMESAKE.,Shall keep alive my own!
774,MY NAMESAKE.,

776,MY NAMESAKE.,"The young leaf wet with morning dew,"
777,MY NAMESAKE.,The glory where the sunbeams fall
778,MY NAMESAKE.,The breezy woodlands through.
779,MY NAMESAKE.,
780,MY NAMESAKE.,"That name shall be a household word,"
781,MY NAMESAKE.,A spell to waken smile or sigh;
782,MY NAMESAKE.,In many an evening prayer be heard
783,MY NAMESAKE.,And cradle lullaby.
784,MY NAMESAKE.,
785,MY NAMESAKE.,"And thou, dear child, in riper days"
786,MY NAMESAKE.,"When asked the reason of thy name,"
787,MY NAMESAKE.,Shalt answer: One 't were vain to praise
788,MY NAMESAKE.,Or censure bore the same.
789,MY NAMESAKE.,
790,MY NAMESAKE.,"""Some blamed him, some believed him good,"
791,MY NAMESAKE.,The truth lay doubtless 'twixt the two;
792,MY NAMESAKE.,He reconciled as best he could
793,MY NAMESAKE.,Old faith and fancies new.
794,MY NAMESAKE.,
795,MY NAMESAKE.,"""In him the grave and playful mixed,"
796,MY NAMESAKE.,"And wisdom held with folly truce,"
797,MY NAMESAKE.,And Nature compromised betwixt
798,MY NAMESAKE.,Good fellow and recluse.
799,MY NAMESAKE.,
800,MY NAMESAKE.,"""He loved his friends, forgave his foes;"
801,MY NAMESAKE.,"And, if his words were harsh at times,"
802,MY NAMESAKE.,"He spared his fellow-men,--his blows"
803,MY NAMESAKE.,Fell only on their crimes.
804,MY NAMESAKE.,
805,MY NAMESAKE.,"""He loved the good and wise, but found"
806,MY NAMESAKE.,His human heart to all akin
807,MY NAMESAKE.,Who met him on the common ground
808,MY NAMESAKE.,Of suffering and of sin.
809,MY NAMESAKE.,
810,MY NAMESAKE.,"""Whate'er his neighbors might endure"
811,MY NAMESAKE.,Of pain or grief his own became;
812,MY NAMESAKE.,For all the ills he could not cure
813,MY NAMESAKE.,He held himself to blame.
814,MY NAMESAKE.,
815,MY NAMESAKE.,"""His good was mainly an intent,"
816,MY NAMESAKE.,His evil not of forethought done;
817,MY NAMESAKE.,The work he wrought was rarely meant
818,MY NAMESAKE.,Or finished as begun.
819,MY NAMESAKE.,
820,MY NAMESAKE.,"""Ill served his tides of feeling strong"
821,MY NAMESAKE.,To turn the common mills of use;
822,MY NAMESAKE.,"And, over restless wings of song,"
823,MY NAMESAKE.,His birthright garb hung loose!
824,MY NAMESAKE.,
825,MY NAMESAKE.,"""His eye was beauty's powerless slave,"
826,MY NAMESAKE.,And his the ear which discord pains;
827,MY NAMESAKE.,Few guessed beneath his aspect grave
828,MY NAMESAKE.,What passions strove in chains.
829,MY NAMESAKE.,
830,MY NAMESAKE.,"""He had his share of care and pain,"
831,MY NAMESAKE.,No holiday was life to him;
832,MY NAMESAKE.,Still in the heirloom cup we drain
833,MY NAMESAKE.,The bitter drop will swim.
834,MY NAMESAKE.,
835,MY NAMESAKE.,"""Yet Heaven was kind, and here a bird"
836,MY NAMESAKE.,And there a flower beguiled his way;
837,MY NAMESAKE.,"And, cool, in summer noons, he heard"
838,MY NAMESAKE.,The fountains plash and play.
839,MY NAMESAKE.,
840,MY NAMESAKE.,"""On all his sad or restless moods"
841,MY NAMESAKE.,The patient peace of Nature stole;
842,MY NAMESAKE.,The quiet of the fields and woods
843,MY NAMESAKE.,Sank deep into his soul.
844,MY NAMESAKE.,
845,MY NAMESAKE.,"""He worshipped as his fathers did,"
846,MY NAMESAKE.,"And kept the faith of childish days,"
847,MY NAMESAKE.,"And, howsoe'er he strayed or slid,"
848,MY NAMESAKE.,He loved the good old ways.
849,MY NAMESAKE.,
850,MY NAMESAKE.,"""The simple tastes, the kindly traits,"
851,MY NAMESAKE.,"The tranquil air, and gentle speech,"
852,MY NAMESAKE.,The silence of the soul that waits
853,MY NAMESAKE.,For more than man to teach.
854,MY NAMESAKE.,
855,MY NAMESAKE.,"""The cant of party, school, and sect,"
856,MY NAMESAKE.,"Provoked at times his honest scorn,"
857,MY NAMESAKE.,"And Folly, in its gray respect,"
858,MY NAMESAKE.,He tossed on satire's horn.
859,MY NAMESAKE.,
860,MY NAMESAKE.,"""But still his heart was full of awe"
861,MY NAMESAKE.,And reverence for all sacred things;
862,MY NAMESAKE.,"And, brooding over form and law,'"
863,MY NAMESAKE.,He saw the Spirit's wings!
864,MY NAMESAKE.,
865,MY NAMESAKE.,"""Life's mystery wrapt him like a cloud;"
866,MY NAMESAKE.,"He heard far voices mock his own,"
867,MY NAMESAKE.,"The sweep of wings unseen, the loud,"
868,MY NAMESAKE.,Long roll of waves unknown.
869,MY NAMESAKE.,
870,MY NAMESAKE.,"""The arrows of his straining sight"
871,MY NAMESAKE.,"Fell quenched in darkness; priest and sage,"
872,MY NAMESAKE.,"Like lost guides calling left and right,"
873,MY NAMESAKE.,Perplexed his doubtful age.
874,MY NAMESAKE.,
875,MY NAMESAKE.,"""Like childhood, listening for the sound"
876,MY NAMESAKE.,"Of its dropped pebbles in the well,"
877,MY NAMESAKE.,All vainly down the dark profound
878,MY NAMESAKE.,His brief-lined plummet fell.
879,MY NAMESAKE.,
880,MY NAMESAKE.,"""So, scattering flowers with pious pains"
881,MY NAMESAKE.,"On old beliefs, of later creeds,"
882,MY NAMESAKE.,"Which claimed a place in Truth's domains,"
883,MY NAMESAKE.,He asked the title-deeds.
884,MY NAMESAKE.,
885,MY NAMESAKE.,"""He saw the old-time's groves and shrines"
886,MY NAMESAKE.,In the long distance fair and dim;
887,MY NAMESAKE.,"And heard, like sound of far-off pines,"
888,MY NAMESAKE.,The century-mellowed hymn!
889,MY NAMESAKE.,
890,MY NAMESAKE.,"""He dared not mock the Dervish whirl,"
891,MY NAMESAKE.,"The Brahmin's rite, the Lama's spell;"
892,MY NAMESAKE.,God knew the heart; Devotion's pearl
893,MY NAMESAKE.,Might sanctify the shell.
894,MY NAMESAKE.,
895,MY NAMESAKE.,"""While others trod the altar stairs"
896,MY NAMESAKE.,He faltered like the publican;
897,MY NAMESAKE.,"And, while they praised as saints, his prayers"
898,MY NAMESAKE.,Were those of sinful man.
899,MY NAMESAKE.,
900,MY NAMESAKE.,"""For, awed by Sinai's Mount of Law,"
901,MY NAMESAKE.,"The trembling faith alone sufficed,"
902,MY NAMESAKE.,"That, through its cloud and flame, he saw"
903,MY NAMESAKE.,"The sweet, sad face of Christ!"
904,MY NAMESAKE.,
905,MY NAMESAKE.,"""And listening, with his forehead bowed,"
906,MY NAMESAKE.,Heard the Divine compassion fill
907,MY NAMESAKE.,The pauses of the trump and cloud
908,MY NAMESAKE.,With whispers small and still.
909,MY NAMESAKE.,
910,MY NAMESAKE.,"""The words he spake, the thoughts he penned,"
911,MY NAMESAKE.,"Are mortal as his hand and brain,"
912,MY NAMESAKE.,"But, if they served the Master's end,"
913,MY NAMESAKE.,"He has not lived in vain!"""
914,MY NAMESAKE.,
915,MY NAMESAKE.,"Heaven make thee better than thy name,"
916,MY NAMESAKE.,Child of my friends!--For thee I crave
917,MY NAMESAKE.,"What riches never bought, nor fame"
918,MY NAMESAKE.,To mortal longing gave.
919,MY NAMESAKE.,
920,MY NAMESAKE.,I pray the prayer of Plato old:
921,MY NAMESAKE.,"God make thee beautiful within,"
922,MY NAMESAKE.,And let thine eyes the good behold
923,MY NAMESAKE.,In everything save sin!
924,MY NAMESAKE.,
925,MY NAMESAKE.,Imagination held in check
926,MY NAMESAKE.,"To serve, not rule, thy poised mind;"
927,MY NAMESAKE.,"Thy Reason, at the frown or beck"
928,MY NAMESAKE.,"Of Conscience, loose or bind."
929,MY NAMESAKE.,
930,MY NAMESAKE.,"No dreamer thou, but real all,--"
931,MY NAMESAKE.,Strong manhood crowning vigorous youth;
932,MY NAMESAKE.,Life made by duty epical
933,MY NAMESAKE.,And rhythmic with the truth.
934,MY NAMESAKE.,
935,MY NAMESAKE.,So shall that life the fruitage yield
936,MY NAMESAKE.,"Which trees of healing only give,"
937,MY NAMESAKE.,And green-leafed in the Eternal field

1195,MY PSALM.,MY PSALM.
1196,MY PSALM.,
1197,MY PSALM.,I mourn no more my vanished years
1198,MY PSALM.,"Beneath a tender rain,"
1199,MY PSALM.,"An April rain of smiles and tears,"
1200,MY PSALM.,My heart is young again.
1201,MY PSALM.,
1202,MY PSALM.,"The west-winds blow, and, singing low,"
1203,MY PSALM.,I hear the glad streams run;
1204,MY PSALM.,The windows of my soul I throw
1205,MY PSALM.,Wide open to the sun.
1206,MY PSALM.,
1207,MY PSALM.,No longer forward nor behind
1208,MY PSALM.,I look in hope or fear;
1209,MY PSALM.,"But, grateful, take the good I find,"
1210,MY PSALM.,The best of now and here.
1211,MY PSALM.,
1212,MY PSALM.,"I plough no more a desert land,"
1213,MY PSALM.,To harvest weed and tare;
1214,MY PSALM.,The manna dropping from God's hand
1215,MY PSALM.,Rebukes my painful care.
1216,MY PSALM.,
1217,MY PSALM.,"I break my pilgrim staff, I lay"
1218,MY PSALM.,Aside the toiling oar;
1219,MY PSALM.,The angel sought so far away
1220,MY PSALM.,I welcome at my door.
1221,MY PSALM.,
1222,MY PSALM.,The airs of spring may never play
1223,MY PSALM.,"Among the ripening corn,"
1224,MY PSALM.,Nor freshness of the flowers of May
1225,MY PSALM.,Blow through the autumn morn.
1226,MY PSALM.,
1227,MY PSALM.,Yet shall the blue-eyed gentian look
1228,MY PSALM.,"Through fringed lids to heaven,"
1229,MY PSALM.,And the pale aster in the brook
1230,MY PSALM.,Shall see its image given;--
1231,MY PSALM.,
1232,MY PSALM.,"The woods shall wear their robes of praise,"
1233,MY PSALM.,"The south-wind softly sigh,"
1234,MY PSALM.,"And sweet, calm days in golden haze"
1235,MY PSALM.,Melt down the amber sky.
1236,MY PSALM.,
1237,MY PSALM.,Not less shall manly deed and word
1238,MY PSALM.,Rebuke an age of wrong;
1239,MY PSALM.,The graven flowers that wreathe the sword
1240,MY PSALM.,Make not the blade less strong.
1241,MY PSALM.,
1242,MY PSALM.,"But smiting hands shall learn to heal,--"
1243,MY PSALM.,To build as to destroy;
1244,MY PSALM.,Nor less my heart for others feel
1245,MY PSALM.,That I the more enjoy.
1246,MY PSALM.,
1247,MY PSALM.,"All as God wills, who wisely heeds"
1248,MY PSALM.,"To give or to withhold,"
1249,MY PSALM.,And knoweth more of all my needs
1250,MY PSALM.,Than all my prayers have told.
1251,MY PSALM.,
1252,MY PSALM.,Enough that blessings undeserved
1253,MY PSALM.,Have marked my erring track;
1254,MY PSALM.,"That wheresoe'er my feet have swerved,"
1255,MY PSALM.,His chastening turned me back;
1256,MY PSALM.,
1257,MY PSALM.,That more and more a Providence
1258,MY PSALM.,"Of love is understood,"
1259,MY PSALM.,Making the springs of time and sense
1260,MY PSALM.,Sweet with eternal good;--
1261,MY PSALM.,
1262,MY PSALM.,That death seems but a covered way
1263,MY PSALM.,"Which opens into light,"
1264,MY PSALM.,Wherein no blinded child can stray
1265,MY PSALM.,Beyond the Father's sight;
1266,MY PSALM.,
1267,MY PSALM.,"That care and trial seem at last,"
1268,MY PSALM.,"Through Memory's sunset air,"
1269,MY PSALM.,"Like mountain-ranges overpast,"
1270,MY PSALM.,In purple distance fair;
1271,MY PSALM.,
1272,MY PSALM.,That all the jarring notes of life
1273,MY PSALM.,"Seem blending in a psalm,"
1274,MY PSALM.,And all the angles of its strife
1275,MY PSALM.,Slow rounding into calm.
1276,MY PSALM.,
1277,MY PSALM.,"And so the shadows fall apart,"
1278,MY PSALM.,And so the west-winds play;
1279,MY PSALM.,And all the windows of my heart
1280,MY PSALM.,I open to the day.
1281,MY PSALM.,1859.
1282,MY PSALM.,
1283,MY PSALM.,
1284,MY PSALM.,
1285,THE WAITING.,THE WAITING.
1286,THE WAITING.,
1287,THE WAITING.,I wait and watch: before my eyes
1288,THE WAITING.,Methinks the night grows thin and gray;
1289,THE WAITING.,I wait and watch the eastern skies
1290,THE WAITING.,To see the golden spears uprise
1291,THE WAITING.,Beneath the oriflamme of day!
1292,THE WAITING.,
1293,THE WAITING.,Like one whose limbs are bound in trance
1294,THE WAITING.,"I hear the day-sounds swell and grow,"
1295,THE WAITING.,"And see across the twilight glance,"
1296,THE WAITING.,"Troop after troop, in swift advance,"
1297,THE WAITING.,The shining ones with plumes of snow!
1298,THE WAITING.,
1299,THE WAITING.,"I know the errand of their feet,"
1300,THE WAITING.,I know what mighty work is theirs;
1301,THE WAITING.,"I can but lift up hands unmeet,"
1302,THE WAITING.,"The threshing-floors of God to beat,"
1303,THE WAITING.,And speed them with unworthy prayers.
1304,THE WAITING.,
1305,THE WAITING.,I will not dream in vain despair
1306,THE WAITING.,The steps of progress wait for me
1307,THE WAITING.,The puny leverage of a hair
1308,THE WAITING.,"The planet's impulse well may spare,"
1309,THE WAITING.,A drop of dew the tided sea.
1310,THE WAITING.,
1311,THE WAITING.,"The loss, if loss there be, is mine,"
1312,THE WAITING.,And yet not mine if understood;
1313,THE WAITING.,"For one shall grasp and one resign,"
1314,THE WAITING.,"One drink life's rue, and one its wine,"
1315,THE WAITING.,And God shall make the balance good.
1316,THE WAITING.,
1317,THE WAITING.,Oh power to do! Oh baffled will!
1318,THE WAITING.,Oh prayer and action! ye are one.
1319,THE WAITING.,"Who may not strive, may yet fulfil"
1320,THE WAITING.,"The harder task of standing still,"
1321,THE WAITING.,And good but wished with God is done!
1322,THE WAITING.,1862.
