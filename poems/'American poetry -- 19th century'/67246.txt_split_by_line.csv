2452,BLIND.,One there was
2453,BLIND.,"Among the restless souls beneath its glow,"
2454,BLIND.,For whom the heavenly message was not writ;

2456,BLIND.,Oft had he listened to the merry shout

2458,BLIND.,But ne’er had looked upon their sparkling eyes.
2459,BLIND.,"Alone, he walked in darkness through a life"
2460,BLIND.,"Of nights, with never hope of day. But hark!"
2461,BLIND.,"Upon his ear there falls a gentle voice,"
2462,BLIND.,Whose tones of strange and heavenly sweetness thrill
2463,BLIND.,"His very heart. “’Tis Jesus, ’tis the Christ"

2475,BLIND.,"O weary, heavy-laden one, whose eyes"
2476,BLIND.,"Have long been sightless to behold the truth,--"
2477,BLIND.,"Perchance in darkness walking even now,"
2478,BLIND.,"And longing with an aching heart for light,--"
2479,BLIND.,The Master’s message echoes sweetly still:
2480,BLIND.,"“Be of good comfort, rise, He calleth thee.”"
2481,BLIND.,"And humbly kneeling at His feet, the words"

2858,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.
2859,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,
2860,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,
2861,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Flickers the ruddy firelight on the wall;
2862,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Now here, now there, the shadows restlessly"
2863,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Dance in and out among the gleaming bars
2864,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,That prison many a glimpse of sea and sky
2865,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Upon the pictured canvas. Brightly falls
2866,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,The cheerful light upon familiar forms
2867,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Of volumes clothed in sober garb and gay,"
2868,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Whose very names, in golden characters,"
2869,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Invite to solace sweet, and peace of mind."
2870,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Footfalls incessant in the rainy street
2871,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Mingle their dreary cadence with the roll
2872,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"And rhythmic echo of the iron wheel,"
2873,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Half muffled by the storm’s dull monotone.
2874,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Within, the gentle presence of the flame,"
2875,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"With its soft rustle ever and anon,"
2876,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Serves but to take away the very pain
2877,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Of silence absolute.
2878,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,It is the hour
2879,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,For contemplation meet. The air is thronged
2880,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"With thoughts innumerable, fancies light,"
2881,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"That flit about on airy wing, or play"
2882,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Among the fireborn shadows on the wall;
2883,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Till, touched by the Promethean glow, they take"
2884,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"A seeming form substantial, animate."
2885,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,From out their thin octavo cells pour forth
2886,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"The shapes ethereal of poet, sage,"
2887,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Philosopher, and man of God, whose words"
2888,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Make wisdom beautiful, and beauty wise."
2889,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Silent they rise before me, one by one,"
2890,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"E’en as the fabled genius, close involved"
2891,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Within the tiny casket, gained at last"
2892,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"His proper self, and towered high above"
2893,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,His liberator. But of other mien
2894,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Are these strange forms around my hearth to-night.
2895,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"With aspect grave, yet kind, they gaze on me"
2896,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"As old companions might on one they loved,"
2897,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Who loved them in return. I know each one,"
2898,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,And recognize the habit of his life.
2899,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Old Gilbert White--whose flowing locks, and dress"
2900,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Of quaint antiquity, precise and neat,"
2901,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Recall his quiet walks in Selborne wood--
2902,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Has paused with curious, meditative eye,"
2903,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Before an owl upon my mantle shelf,"
2904,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"And rapidly, in shadowy script, records"
2905,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,The sapient bird’s presentment.
2906,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Near at hand,"
2907,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"A man of kindly countenance and mild,"
2908,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Impressed with lines of pure and noble thought,"
2909,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Bends low in prayer; ere long resumes his pen,"
2910,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,And adds one more sweet hymn to those that bear
2911,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,George Herbert’s name. Anon appears a face
2912,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"More gentle than the rest, it seems, with eyes"
2913,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Of deep and tender yearning. Silently
2914,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"The figure turns aside, and by the hearth"
2915,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Remains aloof, with dreamy gaze intent"
2916,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Upon the glowing coals. What fantasies
2917,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Are imaged there, reflected from his mind,"
2918,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,And striving for the elixir of his touch
2919,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"And wondrous pen, that give eternal life"
2920,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"To such as they! Lo, built of candent fire"

2923,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Of potent herb and flower. The Puritan,"
2924,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"His wonted sternness softened, deigns to tell"
2925,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Of old-time guilt--the Scarlet Letter’s brand--
2926,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Till, glancing up, he shudders at the approach"
2927,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Of stricken Hester, with her demon child."
2928,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,
2929,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,So wanes the night. In quick succession move
2930,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Shades of the mighty dead before my eyes.
2931,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Again is played the Comedy Divine,"
2932,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,And gloomily the awful form of him
2933,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Whose mind such Titan offspring bore, attends"
2934,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"The movement of each scene. The cowl and robe,"
2935,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Close at his side, betray that zealous monk"
2936,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Whose life was Imitation of the Christ.
2937,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Amid the still increasing throng, behold"
2938,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Sage Izaak Walton, creel and rod in hand;"
2939,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"But while I gaze upon his visage mild,"
2940,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Expectant half to hear his counsel how
2941,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"The wily carp to ensnare, the fiery bridge"
2942,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"O’er which my fancy boldly trod, and found"
2943,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"Her way to realms unreal, topples down"
2944,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"With mimic crash, and lies a ruined mass"
2945,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Upon the hearth. Yet by its waning glow
2946,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"I see the hurried parting of my guests,"
2947,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Retreating each within his narrow cell;
2948,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,As when beneath a monastery roof
2949,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"The low, sweet chant of vespers dies away,--"
2950,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,The last faint echoes lingering still within
2951,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"The moonlit cloisters,--silently the forms"
2952,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,Of holy men glide to and fro among
2953,IN MY ARM-CHAIR.,"The shadows, till the hush of night descends"
