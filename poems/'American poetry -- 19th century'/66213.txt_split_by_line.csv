87,PREFATORY NOTE,"This _jeu d’esprit_ was extemporized, I may fairly say, so rapidly"
88,PREFATORY NOTE,"was it written, purely for my own amusement, and with no thought of"
89,PREFATORY NOTE,"publication. I sent daily instalments of it to a friend in New York,"
90,PREFATORY NOTE,the late CHAS F. BRIGGS. He urged me to let it be printed and
91,PREFATORY NOTE,I at last consented to its anonymous publication. The secret was kept
92,PREFATORY NOTE,till after several persons had laid claim to its authorship.

100,PREFATORY NOTE,
101,TO THE READER:,TO THE READER:
102,TO THE READER:,
103,TO THE READER:,"This trifle, begun to please only myself and my own private fancy, was"
104,TO THE READER:,"laid on the shelf. But some friends, who had seen it, induced me, by"
105,TO THE READER:,"dint of saying they liked it, to put it in print. That is, having come"
106,TO THE READER:,"to that very conclusion, I asked their advice when ’t would make no"
107,TO THE READER:,confusion. For though (in the gentlest of ways) they had hinted it was
108,TO THE READER:,"scarce worth the while, I should doubtless have printed it."
109,TO THE READER:,
110,TO THE READER:,"I began it, intending a Fable, a frail, slender thing, rhyme-ywinged,"
111,TO THE READER:,"with a sting in its tail. But, by addings and alterings not previously"
112,TO THE READER:,"planned, digressions chance-hatched, like birds’ eggs in the sand, and"
113,TO THE READER:,dawdlings to suit every whimsey’s demand (always freeing the bird which
114,TO THE READER:,"I held in my hand, for the two perched, perhaps out of reach, in the"
115,TO THE READER:,"tree),--it grew by degrees to the size which you see. I was like the"
116,TO THE READER:,"old woman that carried the calf, and my neighbors, like hers, no doubt,"
117,TO THE READER:,"wonder and laugh; and when, my strained arms with their grown burthen"
118,TO THE READER:,"full, I call it my Fable, they call it a bull."
119,TO THE READER:,
120,TO THE READER:,Having scrawled at full gallop (as far as that goes) in a style that
121,TO THE READER:,"is neither good verse nor bad prose, and being a person whom nobody"
122,TO THE READER:,"knows, some people will say I am rather more free with my readers than"
123,TO THE READER:,"it is becoming to be, but I seem to expect them to wait on my leisure"
124,TO THE READER:,"in following wherever I wander at pleasure, that, in short, I take more"
125,TO THE READER:,than a young author’s lawful ease and laugh in a queer way so like
126,TO THE READER:,"Mephistopheles, that the Public will doubt, as they grope through my"
127,TO THE READER:,"rhythm, if in truth I am making fun _of_ them or _with_ them."
128,TO THE READER:,
129,TO THE READER:,So the excellent Public is hereby assured that the sale of my book is
130,TO THE READER:,already secured. For there is not a poet throughout the whole land
131,TO THE READER:,"but will purchase a copy or two out of hand, in the fond expectation"
132,TO THE READER:,"of being amused in it, by seeing his betters cut up and abused in it."
133,TO THE READER:,"Now, I find, by a pretty exact calculation, there are something like"
134,TO THE READER:,"ten thousand bards in the nation, of that special variety whom the"
135,TO THE READER:,"Review and Magazine critics call _lofty_ and _true_, and about thirty"
136,TO THE READER:,thousand (_this_ tribe is increasing) of the kinds who are termed _full
137,TO THE READER:,of promise and pleasing_. The Public will see by a glance at this
138,TO THE READER:,"schedule, that they cannot expect me to be over-sedulous about courting"
139,TO THE READER:,"_them_, since it seems I have got enough fuel made sure of for boiling"
140,TO THE READER:,my pot.
141,TO THE READER:,
142,TO THE READER:,As for such of our poets as find not their names mentioned once in my
143,TO THE READER:,"pages, with praises or blames, let them SEND IN THEIR CARDS, without"
144,TO THE READER:,"further DELAY, to my friend G. P. PUTNAM, Esquire, in Broadway, where"
145,TO THE READER:,a list will be kept with the strictest regard to the day and the hour
146,TO THE READER:,"of receiving the card. Then, taking them up as I chance to have time"
147,TO THE READER:,"(that is if their names can be twisted in rhyme), I will honestly"
148,TO THE READER:,"give each his PROPER POSITION, at the rate of ONE AUTHOR to each NEW"
149,TO THE READER:,EDITION. Thus a PREMIUM is offered sufficiently HIGH (as the magazines
150,TO THE READER:,say when they tell their best lie) to induce bards to CLUB their
151,TO THE READER:,"resources and buy the balance of every edition, until they have all of"
152,TO THE READER:,them fairly been run through the mill.
153,TO THE READER:,
154,TO THE READER:,One word to such readers (judicious and wise) as read books with
155,TO THE READER:,"something behind the mere eyes, of whom in the country, perhaps, there"
156,TO THE READER:,"are two, including myself, gentle reader, and you. All the characters"
157,TO THE READER:,"sketched in this slight _jeu d’esprit_, though it may be they seem,"
158,TO THE READER:,"here and there, rather free and drawn from a somewhat too cynical"
159,TO THE READER:,"standpoint, are _meant_ to be faithful, for that is the grand point,"
160,TO THE READER:,and none but an owl would feel sore at a rub from a jester who tells
161,TO THE READER:,"you, without any subterfuge, that he sits in Diogenes’ tub."

173,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Though it well may be reckoned, of all composition, the species at once"
174,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"most delightful and healthy, is a thing which an author, unless he be"
175,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"wealthy and willing to pay for that kind of delight, is not, in all"
176,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"instances, called on to write, though there are, it is said, who, their"
177,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"spirits to cheer, slip in a new title-page three times a year, and in"
178,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"this way snuff up an imaginary savor of that sweetest of dishes, the"
179,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"popular favor,--much as if a starved painter should fall to and treat"
180,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,Ugolino inside to a picture of meat.
181,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,
182,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"You remember (if not, pray turn backward and look) that, in writing the"
183,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"preface which ushered my book, I treated you, excellent Public, not"
184,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"merely with a cool disregard, but downright cavalierly. Now I would not"
185,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"take back the least thing I then said, though I thereby could butter"
186,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"both sides of my bread, for I never could see that an author owed aught"
187,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"to the people he solaced, diverted, or taught; and, as for mere fame, I"
188,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,have long ago learned that the persons by whom it is finally earned are
189,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"those with whom _your_ verdict weighed not a pin, unsustained by the"
190,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,higher court sitting within.
191,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,
192,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"But I wander from what I intended to say,--that you have, namely, shown"
193,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,such a liberal way of thinking and so much æsthetic perception of
194,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"anonymous worth in the handsome reception you gave to my book, spite"
195,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,of some private piques (having bought the first thousand in barely
196,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"two weeks), that I think, past a doubt, if you measured the phiz of"
197,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"yours most devotedly, Wonderful Quiz, you would find that its vertical"
198,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"section was shorter, by an inch and two tenths, or ’twixt that and a"
199,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,quarter.
200,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,
201,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,You have watched a child playing--in those wondrous years when belief
202,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"is not bound to the eyes and the ears, and the vision divine is so"
203,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"clear and unmarred, that each baker of pies in the dirt is a bard?"
204,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Give a knife and a shingle, he fits out a fleet, and, on that little"
205,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"mud-puddle over the street his fancy, in purest good faith, will make"
206,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"sail round the globe with a puff of his breath for a gale, will visit,"
207,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"in barely ten minutes, all climes, and do the Columbus-feat hundreds"
208,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"of times. Or, suppose the young poet fresh stored with delights from"
209,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"that Bible of childhood “The Arabian Nights,” he will turn to a crony"
210,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"and cry, “Jack, let’s play that I am a Genius!” Jacky straightway"
211,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"makes Aladdin’s Lamp out of a stone, and, for hours, they enjoy each"
212,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"his own supernatural powers. This is all very pretty and pleasant, but"
213,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"then suppose our two urchins have grown into men, and both have turned"
214,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"authors,--one says to his brother, “Let’s play we’re the American"
215,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"somethings or other,--say Homer or Sophocles, Goethe or Scott (only"
216,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"let them be big enough no matter what). Come, you shall be Byron or"
217,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Pope, which you choose: I’ll be Coleridge, and both shall write mutual"
218,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,reviews.” So they both (as mere strangers) before many days send each
219,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"other a cord of anonymous bays. Each, piling his epithets, smiles in"
220,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"his sleeve to see what his friend can be made to believe; each, reading"
221,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"the other’s unbiased review, thinks--Here’s pretty high praise, but no"
222,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"more than my due. Well, we laugh at them both, and yet make no great"
223,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"fuss when the same farce is acted to benefit us. Even I, who, if asked,"
224,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"scarce a month since, what Fudge meant, should have answered, the dear"
225,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Public’s critical judgment, begin to think sharp-witted Horace spoke"
226,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,sooth when he said that the Public _sometimes_ hit the truth.
227,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,
228,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"In reading these lines, you perhaps have a vision of a person in pretty"
229,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"good health and condition; and yet, since I put forth my primary"
230,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"edition, I have been crushed, scorched, withered, used up and put down"
231,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"(by Smith with the cordial assistance of Brown), in all, if you put any"
232,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"faith in my rhymes, to the number of ninety-five several times, and,"
233,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"while I am writing,--I tremble to think of it, for I may at this moment"
234,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"be just on the brink of it,--Molybdostom, angry at being omitted, has"
235,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"begun a critique,--am I not to be pitied?[1]"
236,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,
237,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Now I shall not crush _them_, since, indeed, for that matter, no"
238,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,pressure I know of could render them flatter; nor wither nor scorn
239,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"them,--no action of fire could make either them or their articles"
240,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,drier; nor waste time in putting them down--I am thinking not their
241,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,own self-inflation will keep them from sinking; for there’s this
242,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"contradiction about the whole bevy,--though without the least weight,"
243,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"they are awfully heavy. No, my dear honest bore, _surdo fabulam"
244,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"narras_, they are no more to me than a rat in the arras. I can walk"
245,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"with the Doctor, get facts from the Don, or draw out the Lambish"
246,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"quintessence of John, and feel nothing more than a half-comic sorrow,"
247,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,to think that they all will be lying to-morrow tossed carelessly up
248,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,on the waste-paper shelves and forgotten by all but their half-dozen
249,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"selves. Once snug in my attic, my fire in a roar, I leave the whole"
250,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,pack of them outside the door. With Hakluyt or Purchas I wander away to
251,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"the black northern seas or barbaric Cathay; get _fou_ with O’Shanter,"
252,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"and sober me then with that builder of brick-kilnish dramas, rare"
253,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Ben; snuff Herbert, as holy as a flower on a grave; with Fletcher"
254,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"wax tender, o’er Chapman grow brave; with Marlowe or Kyd take a fine"
255,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"poet-rave; in Very, most Hebrew of Saxons, find peace; with Lycidas"
256,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"welter on vext Irish seas; with Webster grow wild, and climb earthward"
257,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"again, down by mystical Browne’s Jacob’s-ladder-like brain, to that"
258,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,spiritual Pepys (Cotton’s version) Montaigne; find a new depth in
259,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Wordsworth, undreamed of before,--that marvel, a poet divine who can"
260,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"bore. Or, out of my study the scholar thrown off, Nature holds up"
261,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"her shield ’gainst the sneer and the scoff; the landscape, forever"
262,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,consoling and kind pours her wine and her oil on the smarts of the
263,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"mind. The waterfall, scattering its vanishing gems; the tall grove"
264,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"of hemlocks, with moss on their stems, like plashes of sunlight; the"
265,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"pond in the woods, where no foot but mine and the bittern’s intrudes,"
266,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,where pitcher-plants purple and gentians hard by recall to September
267,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"the blue of June’s sky; these are all my kind neighbors, and leave"
268,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"me no wish to say aught to you all, my poor critics, but--pish! I’ve"
269,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"buried the hatchet; I’m twisting an allumette out of one of you now,"
270,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"and relighting my calumet. In your private capacities, come when you"
271,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"please, I will give you my hand and a fresh pipe apiece."
272,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,
273,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,As I ran through the leaves of my poor little book to take a fond
274,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"author’s first tremulous look, it was quite an excitement to hunt the"
275,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"_errata_, sprawled in as birds’ tracks are in some kinds of strata"
276,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,(only these made things crookeder). Fancy an heir that a father
277,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"had seen born well-featured and fair, turning suddenly wry-nosed,"
278,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"club-footed, squint-eyed, hair-lipped, wapper-jawed, carrot-haired,"
279,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"from a pride become an aversion,--my case was yet worse. A club-foot"
280,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"(by way of a change) in a verse, I might have forgiven, an _o’s_ being"
281,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"wry, a limp in an _e_, or a cock in an _i_,--but to have the sweet babe"
282,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"served in _pi_! I am not queasy-stomached, but such a Thyestean banquet"
283,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,as that was quite out of the question.
284,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,
285,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"In the edition now issued, no pains are neglected, and my verses, as"
286,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"orators say, stand corrected. Yet some blunders remain of the Public’s"
287,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"own make, which I wish to correct for my personal sake. For instance,"
288,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,a character drawn in pure fun and condensing the traits of a dozen in
289,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"one, has been, as I hear, by some persons applied to a good friend of"
290,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"mine, whom to stab in the side, as we walked along chatting and joking"
291,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"together, would not be _my_ way. I can hardly tell whether a question"
292,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,will ever arise in which he and I should by any strange fortune agree
293,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"but meanwhile, my esteem for him grows as I know him, and, though not"
294,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"the best judge on earth of a poem, he knows what it is he is saying and"
295,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"why, and is honest and fearless, two good points which I have not found"
296,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"so rife I can easily smother my love for them, whether on my side or t’"
297,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,other.
298,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,
299,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"From my other _anonymi_, you may be sure that I know what is meant by a"
300,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"caricature, and what by a portrait. There _are_ those who think it is"
301,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"capital fun to be spattering their ink on quiet, unquarrelsome folk,"
302,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"but the minute the game changes sides and the others begin it, they see"
303,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,something savage and horrible in it. As for me I respect neither women
304,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"nor men for their gender, nor own any sex in a pen. I choose just to"
305,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"hint to some causeless unfriends that, as far as I know, there are"
306,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"always two ends (and one of them heaviest, too) to a staff, and two"
307,A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,parties also to every good laugh.

330,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,By a strange kind of smile he put on when he thought of her.
331,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“My case is like Dido’s,” he sometimes remarked;"
332,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,“When I last saw my love she was fairly embarked
333,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In a laurel, as _she_ thought--but (ah, how fate mocks!)"
334,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,She has found it by this time a very bad box;
335,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Let hunters from me take this saw when they need it,--"
336,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,You’re not always sure of your game when you’ve treed it.
337,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Just conceive such a change taking place in one’s mistress!
338,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,What romance would be left?--who can flatter or kiss trees?
339,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, for mercy’s sake, how could one keep up a dialogue"
340,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With a dull wooden thing that will live and will die a log,--"
341,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Not to say that the thought would forever intrude
342,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That you’ve less chance to win her the more she is wood?
343,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Ah! it went to my heart, and the memory still grieves,"
344,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To see those loved graces all taking their leaves;
345,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Those charms beyond speech, so enchanting, but now,"
346,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As they left me forever, each making its bough!"
347,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If her tongue _had_ a tang sometimes more than was right,"
348,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Her new bark is worse than ten times her old bite.”
349,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
350,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Now, Daphne--before she was happily treeified--"
351,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Over all other blossoms the lily had deified,"
352,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And when she expected the god on a visit
353,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(’Twas before he had made his intentions explicit),"
354,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Some buds she arranged with a vast deal of care,"
355,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To look as if artlessly twined in her hair,"
356,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Where they seemed, as he said, when he paid his addresses,"
357,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like the day breaking through the long night of her tresses;
358,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So whenever he wished to be quite irresistible,"
359,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like a man with eight trumps in his hand at a whist-table
360,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(I feared me at first that the rhyme was untwistable,"
361,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Though I might have lugged in an allusion to Christabel),--"
362,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He would take up a lily, and gloomily look in it,"
363,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As I shall at the ----, when they cut up my book in it."
364,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
365,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Well, here, after all the bad rhyme I’ve been spinning,"
366,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I’ve got back at last to my story’s beginning:
367,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Sitting there, as I say, in the shade of his mistress,"
368,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As dull as a volume of old Chester mysteries,"
369,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or as those puzzling specimens which, in old histories,"
370,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"We read of his verses--the Oracles, namely,--"
371,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(I wonder the Greeks should have swallowed them tamely,"
372,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For one might bet safely whatever he has to risk,"
373,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They were laid at his door by some ancient Miss Asterisk,"
374,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And so dull that the men who retailed them out-doors
375,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Got the ill name of augurs, because they were bores,--)"
376,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"First, he mused what the animal substance or herb is"
377,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Would induce a mustache, for you know he’s _imberbis_;"
378,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Then he shuddered to think how his youthful position
379,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Was assailed by the age of his son the physician;
380,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"At some poems he glanced, had been sent to him lately,"
381,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And the metre and sentiment puzzled him greatly;
382,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Mehercle! I’d make such proceeding felonious,--"
383,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Have they all of them slept in the cave of Trophonius?
384,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Look well to your seat, ’tis like taking an airing"
385,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"On a corduroy road, and that out of repairing;"
386,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It leads one, ’tis true, through the primitive forest,"
387,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Grand natural features, but then one has no rest;"
388,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You just catch a glimpse of some ravishing distance,"
389,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When a jolt puts the whole of it out of existence,--"
390,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why not use their ears, if they happen to have any?”"
391,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,--Here the laurel-leaves murmured the name of poor Daphne.
392,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
393,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“O, weep with me, Daphne,” he sighed, “for you know it’s"
394,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A terrible thing to be pestered with poets!
395,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, alas, she is dumb, and the proverb holds good,"
396,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,She never will cry till she’s out of the wood!
397,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,What wouldn’t I give if I never had known of her?
398,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,’Twere a kind of relief had I something to groan over:
399,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If I had but some letters of hers, now, to toss over,"
400,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I might turn for the nonce a Byronic philosopher,"
401,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And bewitch all the flats by bemoaning the loss of her.
402,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"One needs something tangible, though, to begin on,--"
403,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A loom, as it were, for the fancy to spin on;"
404,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,What boots all your grist? it can never be ground
405,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Till a breeze makes the arms of the windmill go round,"
406,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Or, if ’tis a water-mill, alter the metaphor,"
407,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And say it won’t stir, save the wheel be well wet afore,"
408,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or lug in some stuff about water “so dreamily,”--"
409,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It is not a metaphor, though, ’tis a simile);"
410,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A lily, perhaps, would set _my_ mill a-going,"
411,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For just at this season, I think, they are blowing."
412,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Here, somebody, fetch one; not very far hence"
413,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They’re in bloom by the score, ’tis but climbing a fence,"
414,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There’s a poet hard by, who does nothing but fill his"
415,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whole garden, from one end to t’other, with lilies;"
416,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A very good plan, were it not for satiety,"
417,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"One longs for a weed here and there, for variety;"
418,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Though a weed is no more than a flower in disguise,"
419,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which is seen through at once, if love give a man eyes.”"
420,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
421,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Now there happened to be among Phœbus’s followers,"
422,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A gentleman, one of the omnivorous swallowers"
423,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who bolt every book that comes out of the press,"
424,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Without the least question of larger or less,"
425,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whose stomachs are strong at the expense of their head,--"
426,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For reading new books is like eating new bread,"
427,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"One can bear it at first, but by gradual steps he"
428,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Is brought to death’s door of a mental dyspepsy.
429,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"On a previous stage of existence, our Hero"
430,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Had ridden outside, with the glass below zero;"
431,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He had been, ’tis a fact you may safely rely on,"
432,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of a very old stock a most eminent scion,--"
433,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A stock all fresh quacks their fierce boluses ply on,"
434,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who stretch the new boots Earth’s unwilling to try on,"
435,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whom humbugs of all shapes and sorts keep their eye on,"
436,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whose hair’s in the mortar of every new Zion,"
437,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who, when whistles are dear, go directly and buy one,"
438,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who think slavery a crime that we must not say fie on,"
439,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who hunt, if they e’er hunt at all, with the lion"
440,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Though they hunt lions also, whenever they spy one),"
441,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who contrive to make every good fortune a wry one,"
442,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And at last choose the hard bed of honor to die on,"
443,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whose pedigree, traced to earth’s earliest years,"
444,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Is longer than anything else but their ears;--
445,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In short, he was sent into life with the wrong key,"
446,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He unlocked the door, and stept forth a poor donkey."
447,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Though kicked and abused by his bipedal betters
448,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Yet he filled no mean place in the kingdom of letters;
449,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Far happier than many a literary hack,"
450,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He bore only paper-mill rags on his back
451,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,(For it makes a vast difference which side the mill
452,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,One expends on the paper his labor and skill);
453,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So, when his soul waited a new transmigration,"
454,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And Destiny balanced ’twixt this and that station,"
455,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not having much time to expend upon bothers,"
456,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Remembering he’d had some connection with authors;
457,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And considering his four legs had grown paralytic,--"
458,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She set him on two, and he came forth a critic."
459,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
460,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Through his babyhood no kind of pleasure he took
461,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In any amusement but tearing a book;
462,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For him there was no intermediate stage
463,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,From babyhood up to straight-laced middle age;
464,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There were years when he didn’t wear coat-tails behind,"
465,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But a boy he could never be rightly defined;
466,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Like the Irish Good Folk, though in length scarce a span,"
467,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From the womb he came gravely, a little old man;"
468,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,While other boys’ trousers demanded the toil
469,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of the motherly fingers on all kinds of soil,"
470,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Red, yellow, brown, black, clayey, gravelly, loamy,"
471,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He sat in the corner and read Viri Romæ.
472,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He never was known to unbend or to revel once
473,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In base, marbles, hockey, or kick up the devil once;"
474,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He was just one of those who excite the benevolence
475,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of your old prigs who sound the soul’s depths with a ledger,"
476,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And are on the lookout for some young men to “edger-
477,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Cate,” as they call it, who won’t be too costly,"
478,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And who’ll afterward take to the ministry mostly;
479,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who always wear spectacles, always look bilious,"
480,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Always keep on good terms with each _materfamilias_
481,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Throughout the whole parish, and manage to rear"
482,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Ten boys like themselves, on four hundred a year:"
483,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who, fulfilling in turn the same fearful conditions,"
484,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Either preach through their noses, or go upon missions."
485,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
486,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In this way our Hero got safely to college,"
487,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Where he bolted alike both his commons and knowledge;
488,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A reading-machine, always wound up and going"
489,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He mastered whatever was not worth the knowing,"
490,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Appeared in a gown, with black waistcoat of satin,"
491,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To spout such a Gothic oration in Latin
492,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That Tully could never have made out a word in it
493,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Though himself was the model the author preferred in it),"
494,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And grasping the parchment which gave him in fee
495,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"All the mystic and-so-forths contained in A.B.,"
496,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He was launched (life is always compared to a sea),"
497,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With just enough learning, and skill for the using it,"
498,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To prove he’d a brain, by forever confusing it."
499,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So worthy St. Benedict, piously burning"
500,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the holiest zeal against secular learning,"
501,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"_Nesciensque scienter_, as writers express it,"
502,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,_Indoctusque sapienter a Roma recessit_.
503,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
504,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"’Twould be endless to tell you the things that he knew,"
505,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Each a separate fact, undeniably true,"
506,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But with him or each other they’d nothing to do;
507,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"No power of combining, arranging, discerning,"
508,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Digested the masses he learned into learning;
509,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,There was one thing in life he had practical knowledge for
510,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(And this, you will think, he need scarce go to college for),--"
511,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not a deed would he do, nor a word would he utter,"
512,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Till he’d weighed its relations to plain bread and butter.
513,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When he left Alma Mater, he practised his wits"
514,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In compiling the journals’ historical bits,--"
515,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of shops broken open, men falling in fits,"
516,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Great fortunes in England bequeathed to poor printers,"
517,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And cold spells, the coldest for many past winters,--"
518,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then, rising by industry, knack, and address,"
519,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Got notices up for an unbiased press,"
520,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With a mind so well poised, it seemed equally made for"
521,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Applause or abuse, just which chanced to be paid for;"
522,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From this point his progress was rapid and sure,"
523,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To the post of a regular heavy reviewer.
524,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
525,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And here I must say he wrote excellent articles
526,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"On Hebraical points, or the force of Greek particles;"
527,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They filled up the space nothing else was prepared for,"
528,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And nobody read that which nobody cared for;
529,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If any old book reached a fiftieth edition,"
530,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He could fill forty pages with safe erudition:
531,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He could gauge the old books by the old set of rules,"
532,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And his very old nothings pleased very old fools;
533,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But give him a new book, fresh out of the heart,"
534,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And you put him at sea without compass or chart,--"
535,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,His blunders aspired to the rank of an art;
536,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For his lore was engraft, something foreign that grew in him,"
537,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Exhausting the sap of the native and true in him,"
538,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So that when a man came with a soul that was new in him,"
539,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Carving new forms of truth out of Nature’s old granite,"
540,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"New and old at their birth, like Le Verrier’s planet,"
541,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which, to get a true judgment, themselves must create"
542,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In the soul of their critic the measure and weight,"
543,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Being rather themselves a fresh standard of grace,"
544,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To compute their own judge, and assign him his place,"
545,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Our reviewer would crawl all about it and round it,"
546,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, reporting each circumstance just as he found it,"
547,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Without the least malice,--his record would be"
548,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Profoundly æsthetic as that of a flea,"
549,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which, supping on Wordsworth, should print, for our sakes,"
550,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Recollections of nights with the Bard of the Lakes,"
551,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or, lodged by an Arab guide, ventured to render a"
552,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Comprehensive account of the ruins of Denderah.
553,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
554,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As I said, he was never precisely unkind,"
555,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The defect in his brain was just absence of mind;
556,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If he boasted, ’twas simply that he was self-made,"
557,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A position which I, for one, never gainsaid,"
558,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,My respect for my Maker supposing a skill
559,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In His works which our Hero would answer but ill;
560,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And I trust that the mould which he used may be cracked, or he,"
561,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Made bold by success, may enlarge his phylactery,"
562,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And set up a kind of a man-manufactory,--"
563,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"An event which I shudder to think about, seeing"
564,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That Man is a moral, accountable being."
565,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
566,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He meant well enough, but was still in the way,"
567,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As dunces still are, let them be where they may;"
568,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Indeed, they appear to come into existence"
569,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To impede other folks with their awkward assistance;
570,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If you set up a dunce on the very North Pole
571,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"All alone with himself, I believe, on my soul,"
572,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He’d manage to get betwixt somebody’s shins,"
573,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And pitch him down bodily, all in his sins,"
574,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To the grave polar bears sitting round on the ice,"
575,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"All shortening their grace, to be in for a slice;"
576,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or, if he found nobody else there to pother,"
577,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, one of his legs would just trip up the other,"
578,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For there’s nothing we read of in torture’s inventions,"
579,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like a well-meaning dunce with the best of intentions.
580,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
581,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A terrible fellow to meet in society,"
582,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Not the toast that he buttered was ever so dry at tea;
583,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There he’d sit at the table and stir in his sugar,"
584,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Crouching close for a spring, all the while, like a cougar;"
585,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Be sure of your facts, of your measures and weights,"
586,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of your time,--he’s as fond as an Arab of dates;"
587,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You’ll be telling, perhaps, in your comical way,"
588,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of something you’ve seen in the course of the day;
589,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, just as you’re tapering out the conclusion,"
590,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You venture an ill-fated classic allusion,--"
591,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The girls have all got their laughs ready, when, whack!"
592,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The cougar comes down on your thunderstruck back!
593,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You had left out a comma,--your Greek’s put in joint,"
594,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And pointed at cost of your story’s whole point.
595,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In the course of the evening you find chance for certain
596,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Soft speeches to Anne, in the shade of the curtain:"
597,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You tell her your heart can be likened to _one_ flower,"
598,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“And that, O most charming of women ’s the sunflower,"
599,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which turns”--here a clear nasal voice, to your terror,"
600,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From outside the curtain, says, “That’s all an error.”"
601,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As for him, he’s--no matter, he never grew tender,"
602,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Sitting after a ball, with his feet on the fender,"
603,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Shaping somebody’s sweet features out of cigar smoke
604,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,(Though he’d willingly grant you that such doings are smoke);
605,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"All women he damns with _mutabile semper_,"
606,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And if ever he felt something like love’s distemper,"
607,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"’Twas tow’rds a young lady who spoke ancient Mexican,"
608,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And assisted her father in making a lexicon;
609,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Though I recollect hearing him get quite ferocious
610,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"About Mary Clausum, the mistress of Grotius,"
611,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or something of that sort,--but, no more to bore ye"
612,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With character-painting, I’ll turn to my story."
613,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
614,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Now, Apollo, who finds it convenient sometimes"
615,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To get his court clear of the makers of rhymes,"

626,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Kept our Hero at hand, who, by means of a bray,"
627,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which he gave to the life, drove the rabble away;"
628,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And if that wouldn’t do, he was sure to succeed,"
629,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If he took his review out and offered to read;
630,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or, failing in plans of this milder description,"
631,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He would ask for their aid to get up a subscription,"
632,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Considering that authorship wasn’t a rich craft,"
633,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To print the “American drama of Witchcraft.”
634,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Stay, I’ll read you a scene,”--but he hardly began,"
635,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Ere Apollo shrieked “Help!” and the authors all ran:
636,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And once, when these purgatives acted with less spirit,"
637,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And the desperate case asked a remedy desperate,"
638,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He drew from his pocket a foolscap epistle
639,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As calmly as if ’twere a nine-barrelled pistol,"
640,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And threatened them all with the judgment to come,"
641,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of “A wondering Star’s first impressions of Rome.”
642,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Stop! stop!” with their hands o’er their ears, screamed the Muses,"
643,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“He may go off and murder himself, if he chooses,"
644,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"’Twas a means self-defence only sanctioned his trying,"
645,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,’Tis mere massacre now that the enemy’s flying;
646,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If he’s forced to ’t again, and we happen to be there,"
647,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Give us each a large handkerchief soaked in strong ether.”
648,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
649,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I called this a “Fable for Critics”; you think it’s
650,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,More of a display of my rhythmical trinkets;
651,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"My plot, like an icicle, ’s slender and slippery,"
652,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Every moment more slender, and likely to slip awry,"
653,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And the reader unwilling _in loco desipere_
654,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Is free to jump over as much of my flippery
655,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As he fancies, and, if he’s a provident skipper, he"
656,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"May have like Odysseus control of the gales,"
657,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And get safe to port, ere his patience quite fails;"
658,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Moreover, although ’tis a slender return"
659,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For your toil and expense, yet my paper will burn,"
660,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, if you have manfully struggled thus far with me,"
661,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You may e’en twist me up, and just light your cigar with me:"
662,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If too angry for that, you can tear me in pieces,"
663,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And my _membra disjecta_ consign to the breezes,"
664,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A fate like great Ratzau’s, whom one of those bores"
665,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Who beflead with bad verses poor Louis Quatorze
666,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Describes (the first verse somehow ends with _victoire_),"
667,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As _dispersant partout et ses membres et sa gloire_;
668,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or, if I were over-desirous of earning"
669,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A repute among noodles for classical learning,"
670,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I could pick you a score of allusions, i-wis,"
671,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As new as the jests of _Didaskalos tis_;
672,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Better still, I could make out a good solid list"
673,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From authors recondite who do not exist,--"
674,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But that would be naughty: at least, I could twist"
675,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Something out of Absyrtus, or turn your inquiries"
676,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"After Milton’s prose metaphor, drawn from Osiris;--"
677,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, as Cicero says he won’t say this or that"
678,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(A fetch, I must say, most transparent and flat),"
679,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"After saying whate’er he could possibly think of,--"
680,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I simply will state that I pause on the brink of
681,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A mire, ankle-deep, of deliberate confusion,"
682,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Made up of old jumbles of classic allusion:
683,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So, when you were thinking yourselves to be pitied,"
684,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Just conceive how much harder your teeth you’d have gritted,"
685,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,An ’twere not for the dulness I’ve kindly omitted.
686,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
687,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I’d apologize here for my many digressions,"
688,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Were it not that I’m certain to trip into fresh ones
689,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,(’Tis so hard to escape if you get in their mesh once;)
690,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Just reflect, if you please, how ’tis said by Horatius,"
691,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That Mæonides nods now and then, and, my gracious!"
692,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,It certainly does look a little bit ominous
693,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,When he gets under way with _ton d’apameibomenos_.
694,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Here a something occurs which I’ll just clap a rhyme to,"
695,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And say it myself, ere a Zoilus have time to,--"
696,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Any author a nap like Van Winkle’s may take,"
697,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If he only contrive to keep readers awake,"
698,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But he’ll very soon find himself laid on the shelf,"
699,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If _they_ fall a-nodding when he nods himself.)
700,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
701,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Once for all, to return, and to stay, will I, nill I--"
702,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When Phœbus expressed his desire for a lily,"
703,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Our Hero, whose homœopathic sagacity"
704,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With an ocean of zeal mixed his drop of capacity,"
705,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Set off for the garden as fast as the wind
706,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Or, to take a comparison more to my mind,"
707,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As a sound politician leaves conscience behind),"
708,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And leaped the low fence, as a party hack jumps"
709,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"O’er his principles, when something else turns up trumps."
710,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
711,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He was gone a long time, and Apollo, meanwhile,"
712,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Went over some sonnets of his with a file,"
713,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For, of all compositions, he thought that the sonnet"
714,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Best repaid all the toil you expended upon it;
715,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It should reach with one impulse the end of its course,"
716,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And for one final blow collect all of its force;
717,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not a verse should be salient, but each oneshould tend"
718,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With a wave-like up-gathering to break at the end;
719,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So, condensing the strength here, there smoothing a wry kink,"
720,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He was killing the time, when up walked Mr. D----;"
721,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"At a few steps behind him, a small man in glasses"
722,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Went dodging about, muttering, “Murderers! asses!”"
723,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From out of his pocket a paper he’d take,"
724,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With a proud look of martyrdom tied to its stake,"
725,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, reading a squib at himself, he’d say, “Here I see"
726,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"’Gainst American letters a bloody conspiracy,"
727,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,They are all by my personal enemies written;
728,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I must post an anonymous letter to Britain,"
729,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And show that this gall is the merest suggestion
730,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of spite at my zeal on the Copyright question;
731,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For, on this side the water, ’tis prudent to pull"
732,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"O’er the eyes of the public their national wool,"
733,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,By accusing of slavish respect to John Bull
734,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,All American authors who have more or less
735,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of that anti-American humbug--success,"
736,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,While in private we’re always embracing the knees
737,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of some twopenny editor over the seas,"
738,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And licking his critical shoes, for you know ’tis"
739,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The whole aim of our lives to get one English notice;
740,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,My American puffs I would willingly burn all
741,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(They’re all from one source, monthly, weekly, diurnal)"
742,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To get but a kick from a transmarine journal!”
743,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
744,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So, culling the gibes of each critical scorner"
745,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As if they were plums, and himself were Jack Horner,"
746,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He came cautiously on, peeping round every corner,"
747,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And into each hole where a weasel might pass in,"
748,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Expecting the knife of some critic assassin,"
749,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who stabs to the heart with a caricature,"
750,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not so bad as those daubs of the Sun, to be sure,"
751,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Yet done with a dagger-o’-type, whose vileportraits"
752,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Disperse all one’s good and condense all one’s poor traits.
753,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
754,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Apollo looked up, hearing footsteps approaching,"
755,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And slipped out of sight the new rhymes he was broaching,--"
756,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Good day, Mr. D----, I’m happy to meet,"
757,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With a scholar so ripe, and a critic so neat,"
758,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Who through Grub Street the soul of a gentleman carries;
759,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,What news from that suburb of London and Paris
760,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Which latterly makes such shrill claims to monopolize
761,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The credit of being the New World’s metropolis?”
762,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
763,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Why, nothing of consequence, save this attack"
764,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"On my friend there, behind, by some pitiful hack,"
765,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Who thinks every national author a poor one
766,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That isn’t a copy of something that’s foreign,"
767,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And assaults the American Dick ----”
768,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
769,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Nay, ’tis clear"
770,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That your Damon there’s fond of a flea in his ear,"
771,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, if no one else furnished them gratis, on tick"
772,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He would buy some himself, just to hear the old click;"
773,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, I honestly think, if some fool in Japan"
774,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Should turn up his nose at the ‘Poems on Man’
775,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Which contain many verses as fine, by the bye,"
776,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As any that lately came under my eye),"
777,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Your friend there by some inward instinct would know it,"
778,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Would get it translated, reprinted, and show it;"
779,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As a man might take off a high stock to exhibit
780,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The autograph round his own neck of the gibbet;
781,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Nor would let it rest so, but fire column after column,"
782,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Signed Cato, or Brutus, or something as solemn,"
783,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"By way of displaying his critical crosses,"
784,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And tweaking that poor transatlantic proboscis,"
785,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,His broadsides resulting (this last there’s no doubt of)
786,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In successively sinking the craft they’re fired out of.
787,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Now nobody knows when an author is hit,"
788,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If he have not a public hysterical fit;
789,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Let him only keep close in his snug garret’s dim ether,"
790,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And nobody’d think of his foes--or of him either;
791,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If an author have any least fibre of worth in him,"
792,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Abuse would but tickle the organ of mirth in him;
793,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,All the critics on earth cannot crush with their ban
794,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,One word that’s in tune with the nature of man.”
795,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
796,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Well, perhaps so; meanwhile I have brought you a book,"
797,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Into which if you’ll just have the goodness to look,"
798,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,You may feel so delighted (when once you are through it)
799,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As to deem it not unworth your while to review it,"
800,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And I think I can promise your thoughts, if you do,"
801,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A place in the next Democratic Review.”
802,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
803,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“The most thankless of gods you must surelyhave thought me,"
804,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For this is the forty-fourth copy you’ve brought me,"
805,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I have given them away, or at least I have tried,"
806,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But I’ve forty-two left, standing all side by side"
807,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(The man who accepted that one copy died),--"
808,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,From one end of a shelf to the other they reach
809,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,‘With the author’s respects’ neatly written in each.
810,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The publisher, sure, will proclaim a Te Deum,"
811,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,When he hears of that order the British Museum
812,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Has sent for one set of what books were first printed
813,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In America, little or big,--for ’tis hinted"
814,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That this is the first truly tangible hope he
815,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Has ever had raised for the sale of a copy.
816,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I’ve thought very often ’twould be a good thing
817,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In all public collections of books, if a wing"
818,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Were set off by itself, like the seas from the dry lands,"
819,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Marked _Literature suited to desolate islands_,"
820,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And filled with such books as could never ber ead
821,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Save by readers of proofs, forced to do it for bread,--"
822,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Such books as one’s wrecked on in small countryt averns,"
823,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Such as hermits might mortify over in caverns,"
824,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Such as Satan, if printing had then been invented,"
825,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As the climax of woe, would to Job have presented,"
826,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Such as Crusoe might dip in, although there are few so"
827,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Outrageously cornered by fate as poor Crusoe;
828,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And since the philanthropists just now are banging
829,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And gibbeting all who’re in favor of hanging
830,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,(Though Cheever has proved that the Bible and Altar
831,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Were let down from Heaven at the end of a halter,"
832,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And that vital religion would dull and grow callous,"
833,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Unrefreshed, now and then, with a sniff of the gallows),--"
834,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And folks are beginning to think it looks odd,"
835,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To choke a poor scamp for the glory of God;
836,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And that He who esteems the Virginia reel
837,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A bait to draw saints from their spiritual weal,"
838,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And regards the quadrille as a far greater knavery
839,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Than crushing His African children with slavery,--"
840,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Since all who take part in a waltz or cotillion
841,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Are mounted for hell on the Devil’s own pillion,"
842,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who, as every true orthodox Christian well knows,"
843,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Approaches the heart through the door of the toes,--"
844,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That He, I was saying, whose judgments are stored"
845,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For such as take steps in despite of His word,"
846,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Should look with delight on the agonized prancing
847,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of a wretch who has not the least ground for his dancing,"
848,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"While the State, standing by, sings a verse from the Psalter"
849,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"About offering to God on his favorite halter,"
850,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, when the legs droop from their twitching divergence,"
851,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Sells the clothes to a Jew, and the corpse to the surgeons;--"
852,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Now, instead of all this, I think I can direct you all"
853,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To a criminal code both humane and effectual;--
854,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I propose to shut up every doer of wrong
855,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With these desperate books, for such term, short or long,"
856,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As by statute in such cases made and provided,"
857,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Shall be by your wise legislators decided:
858,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Thus: Let murderers be shut, to grow wiser and cooler,"
859,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,At hard labor for life on the works of Miss ----;
860,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Petty thieves, kept from flagranter crimes by their fears,"
861,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Shall peruse Yankee Doodle a blank term of years,--"
862,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That American Punch, like the English, no doubt,--"
863,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Just the sugar and lemons and spirit left out.
864,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
865,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“But stay, here comes Tityrus Griswold, and leads on"
866,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The flocks whom he first plucks alive, and then feeds on,--"
867,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A loud-cackling swarm, in whose feathers warm-drest,"
868,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He goes for as perfect a--swan as the rest.
869,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
870,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“There comes Emerson first, whose rich words, every one,"
871,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Are like gold nails in temples to hang trophies on,"
872,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whose prose is grand verse, while his verse, the Lord knows,"
873,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Is some of it pr-- No, ’tis not even prose;"
874,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I’m speaking of metres; some poems have welled
875,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,From those rare depths of soul that have ne’er been excelled;
876,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They’re not epics, but that doesn’t matter a pin,"
877,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In creating, the only hard thing’s to begin;"
878,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A grass-blade’s no easier to make than an oak;

880,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In the worst of his poems are mines of rich matter,"
881,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But thrown in a heap with a crash and a clatter;
882,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Now it is not one thing nor another alone
883,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Makes a poem, but rather the general tone,"
884,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The something pervading, uniting the whole,"
885,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The before unconceived, unconceivable soul,"
886,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So that just in removing this trifle or that, you"
887,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Take away, as it were, a chief limb of the statue;"
888,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Roots, wood, bark, and leaves singly perfect may be,"
889,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But clapt hodge-podge together, they don’t make a tree."
890,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
891,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“But, to come back to Emerson (whom, by the way,"
892,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I believe we left waiting),--his is, we may say,"
893,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A Greek head on right Yankee shoulders, whose range"

907,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And who’s willing to worship the stars and the sun,"
908,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A convert to--nothing but Emerson.
909,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So perfect a balance there is in his head,"
910,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That he talks of things sometimes as if they were dead;
911,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Life, nature, love, God, and affairs of that sort,"
912,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He looks at as merely ideas; in short,"
913,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As if they were fossils stuck round in a cabinet,"
914,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of such vast extent that our earth’s a mere dab in it;

940,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,C. shows you how every-day matters unite
941,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the dim transdiurnal recesses of night,--"
942,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"While E., in a plain, preternatural way,"
943,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Makes mysteries matters of mere every day;
944,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"C. draws all his characters quite _à la_ Fuseli,--"
945,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not sketching their bundles of muscles and thews illy,"
946,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He paints with a brush so untamed and profuse,"
947,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,They seem nothing but bundles of muscles and thews;
948,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"E. is rather like Flaxman, lines strait and severe,"
949,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And a colorless outline, but full, round, and clear;--"
950,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To the men he thinks worthy he frankly accords
951,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The design of a white marble statue in words.
952,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"C. labors to get at the centre, and then"
953,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Take a reckoning from there of his actions and men;
954,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"E. calmly assumes the said centre as granted,"
955,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, given himself, has whatever is wanted."
956,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
957,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“He has imitators in scores, who omit"
958,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"No part of the man but his wisdom and wit,--"
959,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who go carefully o’er the sky-blue of his brain,"
960,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And when he has skimmed it once, skim it again;"
961,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If at all they resemble him, you may be sure it is"
962,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Because their shoals mirror his mists andobscurities,"
963,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As a mud-puddle seems deep as Heaven for a minute,"
964,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,While a cloud that floats o’er is reflected within it.
965,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
966,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“There comes ----, for instance; to see him’s rare sport,"
967,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Tread in Emerson’s tracks with legs painfully short;
968,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"How he jumps, how he strains, and gets red in the face,"
969,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To keep step with the mystagogue’s natural pace!
970,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He follows as close as a stick to a rocket,"
971,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,His fingers exploring the prophet’s each pocket.
972,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Fie, for shame, brother bard; with good fruit of your own,"
973,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Can’t you let Neighbor Emerson’s orchards alone?
974,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Besides, ’tis no use, you’ll not find e’en a core,--"

976,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They might strip every tree, and E. never would catch ’em,"

978,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When they send him a dishful, and ask him to try ’em,"
979,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He never suspects how the sly rogues came by ’em,"
980,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He wonders why ’tis there are none such his trees on,"
981,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And thinks ’em the best he has tasted this season.
982,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
983,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Yonder, calm as a cloud, Alcott stalks in a dream,"
984,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And fancies himself in thy groves, Academe,"
985,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the Parthenon nigh, and the olive-trees o’er him,"
986,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And never an act to perplex him or bore him,"
987,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With a snug room at Plato’s when night comes, to walk to,"
988,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And people from morning till midnight to talk to,"
989,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And from midnight till morning, nor snore in their listening;--"
990,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So he muses, his face with the joy of it glistening,"
991,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For his highest conceit of a happiest state is
992,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Where they’d live upon acorns, and hear him talk gratis;"
993,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And indeed, I believe, no man ever talked better,--"
994,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Each sentence hangs perfectly poised to a letter;
995,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He seems piling words, but there’s royal dust hid"
996,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In the heart of each sky-piercing pyramid.
997,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"While he talks he is great, but goes out like a taper,"
998,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If you shut him up closely with pen, ink, and paper;"
999,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Yet his fingers itch for ’em from morning till night,"
1000,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And he thinks he does wrong if he don’t always write;
1001,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In this, as in all things, a lamb among men,"
1002,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He goes to sure death when he goes to his pen.
1003,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
1004,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Close behind him is Brownson, his mouth very full"

1007,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A stream of transparent and forcible prose;
1008,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He shifts quite about, then proceeds to expound"
1009,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That ’tis merely the earth, not himself, that turns round"
1010,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And wishes it clearly impressed on your mind

1013,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With no doctrine pleased that’s not somewhere denied,"
1014,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He lays the denier away on the shelf,"
1015,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And then--down beside him lies gravely himself.
1016,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He’s the Salt River boatman, who always stands willing"
1017,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To convey friend or foe without charging a shilling,"
1018,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And so fond of the trip that, when leisure’s to spare,"
1019,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He’ll row himself up, if he can’t get a fare."
1020,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The worst of it is, that his logic’s so strong,"
1021,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That of two sides he commonly chooses the wrong;
1022,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If there _is_ only one, why, he’ll split it in two,"
1023,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And first pummel this half, then that, black and blue."
1024,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That white’s white needs no proof, but it takes a deep fellow"
1025,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To prove it jet-black, and that jet-black is yellow."
1026,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He offers the true faith to drink in a sieve,--"
1027,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,When it reaches your lips there’s naught left to believe
1028,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But a few silly-(syllo-, I mean)-gisms that squat ’em"
1029,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Like tadpoles, o’erjoyed with the mud at the bottom."
1030,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
1031,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“There is Willis, all _natty_ and jaunty and gay,"
1032,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who says his best things in so foppish a way,"
1033,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With conceits and pet phrases so thickly o’erlaying ’em,"

1035,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Over-ornament ruins both poem and prose,"

1039,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But he twitches and jerks so, one fairly gets tired,"
1040,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And is forced to forgive where one might have admired;
1041,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Yet whenever it slips away free and unlaced,"
1042,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It runs like a stream with a musical waste,"
1043,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And gurgles along with the liquidest sweep;--
1044,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"’Tis not deep as a river, but who’d have it deep?"
1045,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In a country where scarcely a village is found
1046,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That has not its author sublime and profound,"
1047,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For some one to be slightly shallow’s a duty,"
1048,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And Willis’s shallowness makes half his beauty.
1049,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His prose winds along with a blithe, gurgling error,"
1050,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And reflects all of Heaven it can see in its mirror:
1051,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"’Tis a narrowish strip, but it is not an artifice;"
1052,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,’Tis the true out-of-doors with its genuinehearty phiz;
1053,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It is Nature herself, and there’s something in that,"
1054,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Since most brains reflect but the crown of a hat.
1055,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Few volumes I know to read under a tree,"
1056,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"More truly delightful than his A l’Abri,"
1057,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the shadows of leaves flowing over your book,"
1058,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like ripple-shades netting the bed of a brook;
1059,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With June coming softly your shoulder to look over,"
1060,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Breezes waiting to turn every leaf of your book over,"
1061,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And Nature to criticise still as you read,--"

1068,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His nature’s a glass of champagne with the foam on ’t,"
1069,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As tender as Fletcher, as witty as Beaumont;"

1071,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If he wait, all is spoiled; he may stir it andshake it,"
1072,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, the fixed air once gone, he can never remake it."
1073,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He might be a marvel of easy delightfulness,"
1074,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If he would not sometimes leave the _r_ out of sprightfulness;
1075,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And he ought to let Scripture alone--’tis self-slaughter,"
1076,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For nobody likes inspiration-and-water.
1077,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He’d have been just the fellow to sup at the Mermaid,"

1088,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Or something of that sort; I know they all went

1090,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He went a step farther; without cough or hem,"
1091,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He frankly avowed he believed not in them;
1092,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, before he could be jumbled up or prevented,"
1093,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,From their orthodox kind of dissent he dissented.
1094,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There was heresy here, you perceive, for the right"
1095,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of privately judging means simply that light
1096,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Has been granted to me for deciding on _you_;
1097,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And in happier times, before Atheism grew,"

1100,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the same wave is wet that mocked Xerxes and Knut,"
1101,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And we all entertain a secure private notion,"
1102,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That our _Thus far!_ will have a great weight with the ocean.
1103,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,’Twas so with our liberal Christians: they bore
1104,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With sincerest conviction their chairs to the shore;

1106,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Bade natural progress keep out of the Churches,"
1107,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And expected the lines they had drawn to prevail
1108,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With the fast-rising tide to keep out of their pale;
1109,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They had formerly dammed the Pontifical See,"
1110,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And the same thing, they thought, would do nicely for P.;"
1111,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But he turned up his nose at their mumming and shamming,"
1112,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And cared (shall I say?) not a d---- for their damming;
1113,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So they first read him out of their church, and next minute"
1114,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Turned round and declared he had never been in it.
1115,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But the ban was too small or the man was too big,"

1527,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,“The mistake of such fellows as just made the fuss
1528,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Is only in taking a great busy nation
1529,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For a part of their pitiful cotton-plantation.--
1530,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But there comes Miranda, Zeus! where shall I flee to?"
1531,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,She has such a penchant for bothering me too!
1532,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,She always keeps asking if I don’t observe a
1533,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Particular likeness ’twixt her and Minerva;
1534,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,She tells me my efforts in verse are quite clever;--
1535,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She’s been travelling now, and will be worse than ever;"
1536,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"One would think, though, a sharp-sighted noter she’d be"
1537,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of all that’s worth mentioning over the sea,"
1538,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For a woman must surely see well, if she try,"
1539,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The whole of whose being’s a capital I:
1540,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She will take an old notion, and make it her own,"
1541,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"By saying it o’er in her Sibylline tone,"
1542,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or persuade you ’tis something tremendously deep,"
1543,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,By repeating it so as to put you to sleep;
1544,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And she well may defy any mortal to see through it,"
1545,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,When once she has mixed up her infinite me through it.
1546,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There is one thing she owns in her own single right,"
1547,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It is native and genuine--namely, her spite;"
1548,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Though, when acting as censor, she privately blows"
1549,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A censer of vanity ’neath her own nose.”
1550,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
1551,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Here Miranda came up, and said, “Phœbus!you know"
1552,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That the Infinite Soul has its infinite woe,"
1553,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As I ought to know, having lived cheek by jowl,"
1554,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Since the day I was born, with the Infinite Soul;"
1555,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I myself introduced, I myself, I alone,"
1556,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To my Land’s better life authors solely my own,"
1557,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who the sad heart of earth on their shoulders have taken,"
1558,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whose works sound a depth by Life’s quiet unshaken,"
1559,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Such as Shakespeare, for instance, the Bible, and Bacon,"
1560,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not to mention my own works; Time’s nadir is fleet,"
1561,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, as for myself, I’m quite out of conceit”--"
1562,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
1563,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Quite out of conceit! I’m enchanted to hear it,”"
1564,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Cried Apollo aside. “Who’d have thought she was near it?
1565,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To be sure, one is apt to exhaust those commodities"
1566,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"One uses too fast, yet in this case as odd it is"
1567,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As if Neptune should say to his turbots and whitings,"
1568,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,‘I’m as much out of salt as Miranda’s own writings’
1569,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Which, as she in her own happy manner has said,"
1570,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Sound a depth, for ’tis one of the functions of lead)."
1571,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,She often has asked me if I could not find
1572,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A place somewhere near me that suited her mind;
1573,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I know but a single one vacant, which she,"
1574,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With her rare talent that way, would fit to a T,"
1575,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And it would not imply any pause or cessation
1576,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In the work she esteems her peculiar vocation,--"
1577,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She may enter on duty to-day, if she chooses,"
1578,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And remain Tiring-woman for life to the Muses.”
1579,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
1580,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Miranda meanwhile has succeeded in driving
1581,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Up into a corner, in spite of their striving,"
1582,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A small flock of terrified victims, and there,"
1583,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With an I-turn-the-crank-of-the-Universe air
1584,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And a tone which, at least to _my_ fancy, appears"
1585,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not so much to be entering as boxing your ears,"
1586,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Is unfolding a tale (of herself, I surmise,"
1587,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For ’tis dotted as thick as a peacock’s with I’s).
1588,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"_Apropos_ of Miranda, I’ll rest on my oars"
1589,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And drift through a trifling digression on bores,"
1590,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For, though not wearing ear-rings _in more majorum_,"
1591,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Our ears are kept bored just as if we still wore ’em.
1592,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There was one feudal custom worth keeping, at least,"
1593,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Roasted bores made a part of each well-ordered feast,"
1594,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And of all quiet pleasures the very _ne plus_
1595,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Was in hunting wild bores as the tame ones hunt us.
1596,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Archæologians, I know, who have personal fears"
1597,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of this wise application of hounds and of spears,"
1598,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Have tried to make out, with a zeal more than wonted,"
1599,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,’Twas a kind of wild swine that our ancestors hunted;
1600,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But I’ll never believe that the age which has strewn
1601,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Europe o’er with cathedrals, and otherwise shown"
1602,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That it knew what was what, could by chance not have known"
1603,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Spending, too, its chief time with its buff on, no doubt),"
1604,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Which beast ’twould improve the world most to thin out.
1605,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I divide bores myself, in the manner of rifles,"
1606,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Into two great divisions, regardless of trifles;--"
1607,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There’s your smooth-bore and screw-bore, who do not much vary"
1608,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In the weight of cold lead they respectively carry.
1609,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The smooth-bore is one in whose essence the mind
1610,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Not a corner nor cranny to cling by can find;
1611,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You feel as in nightmares sometimes, when you slip"
1612,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Down a steep slated roof, where there’s nothing to grip;"
1613,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You slide and you slide, the blank horror increases,--"
1614,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,You had rather by far be at once smashed to pieces;
1615,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You fancy a whirlpool below white and frothing,"
1616,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And finally drop off and light upon--nothing.
1617,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The screw-bore has twists in him, faint predilections"
1618,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For going just wrong in the tritest directions;
1619,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When he’s wrong he is flat, when he’s right he can’t show it,"
1620,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He’ll tell you what Snooks said about the new poet,[3]"
1621,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Or how Fogrum was outraged by Tennyson’s Princess;
1622,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He has spent all his spare time and intellect since his
1623,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Birth in perusing, on each art and science,"
1624,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Just the books in which no one puts any reliance,"
1625,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And though _nemo_ we’re told, _horis omnibus sapit_,"
1626,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The rule will not fit him, however you shape it,"
1627,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For he has a perennial foison of sappiness;
1628,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He has just enough force to spoil half your day’s happiness,"
1629,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And to make him a sort of mosquito to be with,"
1630,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But just not enough to dispute or agree with.
1631,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
1632,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,These sketches I made (not to be too explicit)
1633,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From two honest fellows who made me a visit,"
1634,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And broke, like the tale of the Bear and the Fiddle,"
1635,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,My reflections on Halleck short off by the middle;
1636,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I sha’n’t now go into the subject more deeply,"
1637,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For I notice that some of my readers look sleep’ly;
1638,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I will barely remark that, ’mongst civilized nations,"
1639,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,There’s none that displays more exemplary patience
1640,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Under all sorts of boring, at all sorts of hours,"
1641,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From all sorts of desperate persons, than ours."
1642,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not to speak of our papers, our State legislatures,"
1643,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And other such trials for sensitive natures,"
1644,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Just look for a moment at Congress,--appalled,"
1645,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,My fancy shrinks back from the phantom it called;
1646,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, there’s scarcely a member unworthy to frown"
1647,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,’Neath what Fourier nicknames the Boreal crown;
1648,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Only think what that infinite bore-pow’r could do
1649,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If applied with a utilitarian view;
1650,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Suppose, for example, we shipped it with care"
1651,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To Sahara’s great desert and let it bore there;
1652,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If they held one short session and did nothing else,"
1653,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,They’d fill the whole waste with Artesian wells.
1654,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But ’tis time now with pen phonographic to follow
1655,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Through some more of his sketches our laughing Apollo:--
1656,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
1657,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“There comes Harry Franco, and, as he draws near,"
1658,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,You find that’s a smile which you took for a sneer;
1659,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,One half of him contradicts t’other; his wont
1660,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Is to say very sharp things and do very blunt;
1661,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His manner’s as hard as his feelings are tender,"
1662,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And a _sortie_ he’ll make when he means to surrender;
1663,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He’s in joke half the time when he seems to be sternest,"
1664,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When he seems to be joking, be sure he’s in earnest;"
1665,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He has common sense in a way that’s uncommon,"
1666,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Hates humbug and cant, loves his friends like a woman,"
1667,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Builds his dislikes of cards and his friendships of oak,"
1668,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Loves a prejudice better than aught but a joke,"
1669,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Is half upright Quaker, half downright Come-outer,"
1670,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Loves Freedom too well to go stark mad about her,"
1671,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Quite artless himself, is a lover of Art,"
1672,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Shuts you out of his secrets and into his heart,"
1673,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And though not a poet, yet all must admire"
1674,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In his letters of Pinto his skill on the liar.
1675,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
1676,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“There comes Poe, with his raven, like Barnaby Rudge,"
1677,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Three fifths of him genius and two fifths sheer fudge;
1678,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who talks like a book of iambs and pentameters,"
1679,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In a way to make people of common sense damn metres;
1680,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who has written some things quite the best of their kind,"
1681,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But the heart somehow seems all squeezed out by the mind,"
1682,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who--But hey-day! What’s this? Messieurs Mathews and Poe,"
1683,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You mustn’t fling mud-balls at Longfellow so,"
1684,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Does it make a man worse that his character’s such
1685,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As to make his friends love him (as you think) too much?
1686,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, there is not a bard at this moment alive"
1687,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,More willing than he that his fellows should thrive;
1688,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"While you are abusing him thus, even now"
1689,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He would help either one of you out of a slough;
1690,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You may say that he’s smooth and all that till you’re hoarse,"
1691,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But remember that elegance also is force;
1692,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"After polishing granite as much as you will,"
1693,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The heart keeps its tough old persistency still;
1694,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Deduct all you can, _that_ still keeps you at bay;"
1695,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, he’ll live till men weary of Collins and Gray."
1696,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I’m not over-fond of Greek metres in English,"
1697,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To me rhyme’s a gain, so it be not too jinglish,"
1698,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And your modern hexameter verses are no more
1699,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like Greek ones than sleek Mr. Pope is like Homer;
1700,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As the roar of the sea to the coo of a pigeon is,"
1701,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So, compared to your moderns, sounds old"
1702,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Melesigenes;
1703,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I may be too partial, the reason, perhaps, o ’tis"
1704,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That I’ve heard the old blind man recite his own rhapsodies,"
1705,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And my ear with that music impregnate may be,"
1706,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Like the poor exiled shell with the soul of the sea,"
1707,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Or as one can’t bear Strauss when his nature is cloven
1708,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To its deeps within deeps by the stroke of Beethoven;
1709,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, set that aside, and ’tis truth that I speak,"
1710,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Had Theocritus written in English, not Greek,"
1711,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I believe that his exquisite sense would scarce change a line
1712,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In that rare, tender, virgin-like pastoral, Evangeline."
1713,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That’s not ancient nor modern, its place is apart"
1714,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Where time has no sway, in the realm of pure Art,"
1715,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,’Tis a shrine of retreat from Earth’s hubbub and strife
1716,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As quiet and chaste as the author’s own life.
1717,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
1718,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“There comes Philothea, her face all aglow,"
1719,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She has just been dividing some poor creature’s woe,"
1720,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And can’t tell which pleases her most, to relieve"
1721,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His want, or his story to hear and believe;"
1722,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"No doubt against many deep griefs she prevails,"
1723,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For her ear is the refuge of destitute tales;
1724,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She knows well that silence is sorrow’s best food,"
1725,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And that talking draws off from the heart its black blood,"
1726,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,So she’ll listen with patience and let you unfold
1727,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Your bundle of rags as ’twere pure cloth of gold,"
1728,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which, indeed, it all turns to as soon as she’s touched it,"
1729,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And (to borrow a phrase from the nursery) _muched_ it;
1730,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She has such a musical taste, she will go"
1731,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Any distance to hear one who draws a long bow;
1732,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She will swallow a wonder by mere might and main,"
1733,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And thinks it Geometry’s fault if she’s fain
1734,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To consider things flat, inasmuch as they’re plain;"
1735,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Facts with her are accomplished, as Frenchmen would say,--"
1736,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They will prove all she wishes them to either way,--"
1737,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, as fact lies on this side or that, we must try,"
1738,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If we’re seeking the truth, to find where it don’t lie;"
1739,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I was telling her once of a marvellous aloe
1740,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That for thousands of years had looked spindling and sallow,"
1741,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, though nursed by the fruitfullest powers of mud,"
1742,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Had never vouchsafed e’en so much as a bud,"
1743,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Till its owner remarked (as a sailor, you know,"
1744,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Often will in a calm) that it never would blow,"
1745,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For he wished to exhibit the plant, and designed"
1746,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That its blowing should help him in raising the wind;
1747,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,At last it was told him that if he should water
1748,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Its roots with the blood of his unmarried daughter
1749,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Who was born, as her mother, a Calvinist, said,"
1750,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With William Law’s serious caul on her head),"
1751,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,It would blow as the obstinate breeze did when by a
1752,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like decree of her father died Iphigenia;
1753,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,At first he declared he himself would be blowed
1754,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Ere his conscience with such a foul crime he would load,"
1755,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But the thought, coming oft, grew less dark than before,"
1756,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And he mused, as each creditor knocked at his door,"
1757,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If _this_ were but done they would dun me no more;
1758,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I told Philothea his struggles and doubts,"
1759,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And how he considered the ins and the outs
1760,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of the visions he had, and the dreadful dispepsy,"
1761,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"How he went to the seër that lives at Po’keepsie,"
1762,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"How the seër advised him to sleep on it first,"
1763,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And to read his big volume in case of the worst,"
1764,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And further advised he should pay him five dollars
1765,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For writing Hum, Hum, on his wristbands and collars;"
1766,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Three years and ten days these dark words he had studied
1767,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When the daughter was missed, and the aloe had budded;"
1768,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I told how he watched it grow large and more large,"
1769,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And wondered how much for the show he should charge,--"
1770,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She had listened with utter indifference to this, till"
1771,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I told how it bloomed, and, discharging its pistil"
1772,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With an aim the Eumenides dictated, shot"
1773,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The botanical filicide dead on the spot;
1774,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It had blown, but he reaped not his horrible gains,"
1775,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For it blew with such force as to blow out his brains,"
1776,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And the crime was blown also, because on the wad,"
1777,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which was paper, was writ ‘Visitation of God,’"
1778,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As well as a thrilling account of the deed
1779,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Which the coroner kindly allowed me toread.
1780,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
1781,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Well, my friend took this story up just, to be sure,"
1782,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As one might a poor foundling that’s laid at one’s door;
1783,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She combed it and washed it and clothed it and fed it,"
1784,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And as if ’twere her own child most tenderly bred it,"
1785,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Laid the scene (of the legend, I mean) far away a-"
1786,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Mong the green vales underneath Himalaya,"
1787,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And by artist-like touches, laid on here and there,"
1788,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Made the whole thing so touching, I frankly declare"
1789,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I have read it all thrice, and, perhaps I am weak,"
1790,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But I found every time there were tears on my cheek.
1791,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
1792,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“The pole, science tells us, the magnet controls,"
1793,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But she is a magnet to emigrant Poles,"
1794,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And folks with a mission that nobody knows,"
1795,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Throng thickly about her as bees round a rose;
1796,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She can fill up the _carets_ in such, make their scope"
1797,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Converge to some focus of rational hope,"
1798,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, with sympathies fresh as the morning, their gall"
1799,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Can transmute into honey,--but this is not all;"
1800,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not only for those she has solace, O say,"
1801,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Vice’s desperate nursling adrift in Broadway,"
1802,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who clingest, with all that is left of thee human,"
1803,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To the last slender spar from the wreck of the woman,"
1804,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Hast thou not found one shore where those tired drooping feet
1805,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Can reach firm mother-earth, one full heart on whose beat"
1806,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The soothed head in silence reposing could hear
1807,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The chimes of far childhood throb back on the ear?
1808,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Ah, there’s many a beam from the fountain of day"
1809,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That, to reach us unclouded, must pass, on its way,"
1810,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Through the soul of a woman, and hers is wide ope"
1811,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To the influence of Heaven as the blue eyes of Hope;
1812,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Yes, a great heart is hers, one that dares to go in"
1813,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To the prison, the slave-hut, the alleys of sin,"
1814,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And to bring into each, or to find there, some line"
1815,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of the never completely out-trampled divine;
1816,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If her heart at high floods swamps her brain now and then,"

2111,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I ought to have known what the fellow would do,”"
2112,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Muttered Phœbus aside, “for a thistle will pass"
2113,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Beyond doubt for the queen of all flowers with an ass;
2114,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He has chosen in just the same way as he’d choose
2115,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,His specimens out of the books he reviews;
2116,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And now, as this offers an excellent text,"
2117,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I’ll give ’em some brief hints on criticism next.”
2118,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So, musing a moment, he turned to the crowd,"
2119,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, clearing his voice, spoke as follows aloud:--"
2120,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
2121,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“My friends, in the happier days of the muse,"
2122,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,We were luckily free from such thing as reviews;
2123,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Then naught came between with its fog to make clearer
2124,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The heart of the poet to that of his hearer;
2125,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then the poet brought heaven to the people, and they"
2126,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Felt that they, too, were poets in hearing his lay;"
2127,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then the poet was prophet, the past in his soul"
2128,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Precreated the future, both parts of one whole;"
2129,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then for him there was nothing too great or too small,"
2130,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For one natural deity sanctified all;
2131,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Then the bard owned no clipper and meter of moods
2132,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Save the spirit of silence that hovers and broods
2133,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"O’er the seas and the mountains, the rivers and woods;"
2134,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He asked not earth’s verdict, forgetting the clods,"
2135,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,His soul soared and sang to an audience of gods;
2136,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"’Twas for them that he measured the thought and the line,"
2137,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And shaped for their vision the perfect design,"
2138,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With as glorious a foresight, a balance as true,"
2139,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As swung out the worlds in the infinite blue;
2140,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then a glory and greatness invested man’s heart,"
2141,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The universal, which now stands estranged and apart,"
2142,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In the free individual moulded, was Art;"
2143,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Then the forms of the Artist seemed thrilled with desire
2144,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For something as yet unattained, fuller, higher,"
2145,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As once with her lips, lifted hands, and eyes listening,"
2146,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And her whole upward soul in her countenance glistening,"
2147,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Eurydice stood--like a beacon unfired,"
2148,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which, once touched with flame, will leap heav’nward inspired--"
2149,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And waited with answering kindle to mark
2150,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The first gleam of Orpheus that pained the red Dark.
2151,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then painting, song, sculpture did more than relieve"
2152,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The need that men feel to create and believe,"
2153,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And as, in all beauty, who listens with love"
2154,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Hears these words oft repeated--‘beyond and above,’"
2155,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,So these seemed to be but the visible sign
2156,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of the grasp of the soul after things more divine;
2157,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,They were ladders the Artist erected to climb
2158,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"O’er the narrow horizon of space and of time,"
2159,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And we see there the footsteps by which men had gained
2160,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To the one rapturous glimpse of the never-attained,"
2161,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As shepherds could erst sometimes trace in the sod
2162,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The last spurning print of a sky-cleaving god.
2163,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
2164,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“But now, on the poet’s dis-privacied moods"
2165,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With _do this_ and _do that_ the pert critic intrudes;
2166,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,While he thinks he’s been barely fulfilling his duty
2167,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To interpret ’twixt men and their own sense of beauty,"
2168,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And has striven, while others sought honor or pelf,"
2169,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To make his kind happy as he was himself,"
2170,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He finds he’s been guilty of horrid offences
2171,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In all kinds of moods, numbers, genders, and tenses;"
2172,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He’s been _ob_- and _sub_jective, what Kettle calls Pot,"
2173,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Precisely, at all events, what he ought not;"
2174,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"_You have done this_, says one judge; _done that_ says another;"
2175,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"_You should have done this_, grumbles one; _that_, says ’tother;"
2176,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Never mind what he touches, one shrieks out _Taboo!_"
2177,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And while he is wondering what he shall do,"
2178,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Since each suggests opposite topics for song,"
2179,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,They all shout together _you’re right!_ and _you’re wrong!_
2180,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
2181,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"“Nature fits all her children with something to do,"
2182,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He who would write and can’t write can surely review,"
2183,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Can set up a small booth as critic and sell us his
2184,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Petty conceit and his pettier jealousies:
2185,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Thus a lawyer’s apprentice, just out of his teens,"
2186,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Will do for the Jeffrey of six magazines;
2187,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Having read Johnson’s lives of the poets half through,"
2188,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,There’s nothing on earth he’s not competent to;
2189,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He reviews with as much nonchalance as he whistles,--"
2190,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He goes through a book and just picks out the thistles;
2191,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It matters not whether he blame or commend,"
2192,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If he’s bad as a foe, he’s far worse as a friend:"
2193,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Let an author but write what’s above his poor scope,"
2194,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He goes to work gravely and twists up a rope,"
2195,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, inviting the world to see punishment done,"
2196,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Hangs himself up to bleach in the wind and the sun;
2197,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"’Tis delightful to see, when a man comes along"
2198,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who has anything in him peculiar and strong,"
2199,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Every cockboat that swims clear its fierce (pop) gundeck at him,"
2200,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And make as he passes its ludicrous Peck at him”----
2201,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
2202,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Here Miranda came up and began, “As to that”----"
