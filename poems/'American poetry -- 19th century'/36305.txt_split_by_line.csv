66,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.
67,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
68,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
69,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"About six o'clock on a midsummer morning in 1877, a tall old man awoke,"
70,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"and was out of bed next moment,--but he moved with a certain slow"
71,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"leisureliness, as one who will not be hurried. The reason of this"
72,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"deliberate movement was obvious,--he had to drag a paralysed leg, which"
73,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,was only gradually recovering its ability and would always be slightly
74,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"lame. Seen more closely, he was not by any means so old as at first"
75,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,sight one might imagine. His snow-white hair and almost-white grey beard
76,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"indicated some eighty years: but he was vigorous, erect and rosy: his"
77,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"clear grey-blue eyes were bright with a ""wild-hawk look,""--his face was"
78,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"firm and without a line. An air of splendid vital force, despite his"
79,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"infirmity, was diffused from his whole person, and defied the fact of"
80,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"his actual age, which was two years short of sixty."
81,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
82,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Dressing with the same large, leisurely gestures as characterized him in"
83,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"everything, Walt Whitman was presently attired in his invariable suit of"
84,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"grey: and by the time the clock touched half-past seven, he was seated"
85,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"in the verandah, comfortably inhaling the sweet, fresh morning air, and"
86,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,quite ready for his simple breakfast.
87,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
88,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"In this old farmhouse, in the New Jersey hamlet of White Horse, Walt"
89,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Whitman had been long an inmate. He was recovering by almost
90,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"imperceptible degrees from the breakdown induced by over-strain, mental"
91,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"and physical, which had culminated in intermittent paralytic seizures"
92,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"for the last eight years, and had left his robust physique a mere wreck"
93,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"of its former magnificence. Here, in the absolute peace and seclusion of"
94,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"the little wooden house, with its few fields and fruit-trees, he lived"
95,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"in lovable companionship with the farmer-folk, man, wife and sons: and"
96,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"here, the level, faintly undulated country, ""neither attractive nor"
97,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"unattractive,"" supplied all the needs of his strenuous nature and healed"
98,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"him with its calm, curative influences. He steeped himself, month by"
99,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"month, season after season, in ""primitive solitudes, winding stream,"
100,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"recluse and woody banks, sweet-feeding springs and all the charms that"
101,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"birds, grass, wild-flowers, rabbits and squirrels, old oaks,"
102,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"walnut-trees, etc., can bring."" Simple fare, these charms might seem to"
103,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"a townsman: to the ""good grey poet"" they were not only sufficient but"
104,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"inexhaustible. Dearly as he loved the ""swarming and tumultuous"" life of"
105,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"cities, the tops of Broadway omnibuses, the Brooklyn ferry-boats, the"
106,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"eternal panorama of the multitude, his true delight was in the vast"
107,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"expanses, the illimitable spaces, the very earth from which,"
108,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Antæus-like, he drew his vital strength. Out here, in the country"
109,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"solitudes, alone could he observe how--in a way undreamed of by the"
110,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"street-dweller,--"
111,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
112,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Ever upon this stage
113,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Is acted God's calm annual drama,"
114,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Gorgeous processions, songs of birds,"
115,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul,"
116,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"The heaving sea, the waves upon the shore, the musical, strong waves,"
117,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"The woods, the stalwart trees, the slender, tapering trees,"
118,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,The lilliput countless armies of the grass.
119,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
120,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,(_The Return of the Heroes._)
121,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
122,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,It may be doubted whether any other poet who has been inspired by
123,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"outdoor Nature, has approximated so closely as Whitman to the ""shows of"
124,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"all variety,"" which nature presents,--from the infinite gradations of"
125,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"microscopic detail, to the enormous range and sweep of dim vastitudes."
126,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"His poetry has a huge elemental quality, akin to that of winds and"
127,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"clouds and seas. ""To speak with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of"
128,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of"
129,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"trees in the woods and grass by the roadside,""--this was the standard he"
130,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"had set himself: and, in pursuance of this ideal, he had given his first"
131,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"and most typically unconventional volume the title ""_Leaves of Grass_."""
132,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"No name could better convey and sum up his meaning in art,--a commixture"
133,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"of the minute and the universal, the simple and the inexplicable, the"
134,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"particular and the all-pervading,--the commonplace which is also the"
135,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"miracle: for to Whitman leaves of grass were this and more. ""To me,"" he"
136,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"declared, ""as I lean and loaf at my ease, observing a spear of summer"
137,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"grass,"""
138,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
139,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Every hour of the light and dark is a miracle--
140,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Every cubic inch of space is a miracle,"
141,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
142,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"the grass-blades no less so than the ""gentle soft-born measureless"
143,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"light."" And, avowedly, from these external expressions of nature he"
144,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,derived all power of song--
145,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
146,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"I hear you whispering there, O stars of heaven--"
147,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"O suns--O grass of graves--O perpetual transfers and promotions,--"
148,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"If you do not say anything, how can I say anything?"
149,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
150,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Thus he had arrived at declaring, with august arrogance: ""Let others"
151,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,finish specimens--I never finish specimens: I shower them by exhaustless
152,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"laws as Nature does, fresh and modern continually."""
153,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
154,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Nor are you to suppose that this was a late development of
155,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,nature-worship in a man suddenly confronted with teeming glories and
156,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,wonderments. All through his life he had been soaking himself in the
157,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"mysterious loveliness of the world around. ""Even as a boy,"" he wrote, ""I"
158,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"had the fancy, the wish, to write a poem about the seashore--that"
159,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"suggesting dividing line, contact, junction, the solid marrying the"
160,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"liquid--that curious, lurking something (as doubtless every objective"
161,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,form finally becomes to the subjective spirit) which means far more than
162,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"its mere first sight, grand as that is.... I felt that I must one day"
163,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"write a book expressing this liquid, mystic theme. Afterward ... it came"
164,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"to me that instead of any special lyrical or epical or literary attempt,"
165,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"the seashore should be an invisible _influence_, a pervading gauge and"
166,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"tally for me in my composition."" Even as a child, upon the desolate"
167,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"beaches of Long Island, he had, ""leaving his bed, wandered alone,"
168,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"bare-headed, barefoot,"" over the sterile sands and the fields beyond,"
169,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,and explored the secret sources of tragedy that are hidden at the roots
170,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,of love.
171,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
172,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Once Paumanok,"
173,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,When the snows had melted--when the lilac-scent was in the air
174,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"and Fifth-month grass was growing,"
175,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Up this seashore, in some briers,"
176,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Two guests from Alabama--two together,"
177,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"And their nest, and four light-green eggs, spotted with brown,"
178,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"And every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,"
179,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"And every day the she-bird crouch'd on her nest, silent, with bright"
180,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"eyes,"
181,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing"
182,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"them,"
183,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating."
184,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
185,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,*       *       *       *       *
186,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
187,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Till of a sudden,"
188,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"May-be kill'd, unknown to her mate,"
189,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"One forenoon the she-bird crouch'd not on the nest,"
190,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next,"
191,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Nor ever appear'd again.
192,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
193,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea,"
194,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather....
195,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
196,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Yes, when the stars glisten'd,"
197,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"All night long on the prong of a moss-scallop'd stake,"
198,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Down, almost amid the slapping waves,"
199,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears
200,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
201,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,*       *       *       *       *
202,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
203,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,"
204,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Listen'd long and long....
205,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
206,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,(_Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking_).
207,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
208,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,But now the Stafford family were assembled at breakfast and Walt limped
209,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,in to join them. Courteously and simply he greeted the various members
210,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"of the household,--the dark, silent, diligent Methodist father,--the"
211,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"spiritually-minded yet busy-handed mother,--the two young fellows, the"
212,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"married daughter and her little ones. He was the most domesticated,"
213,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"least troublesome of inmates, and his ""large sweet presence"" imparted"
214,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"something to the homely breakfast-table, something of benignity and"
215,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"tranquillity, which it had lacked before his entrance. ""The best man I"
216,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"ever knew,"" Mrs. Stafford called him. Her sons adored him; and her"
217,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"grandchildren were almost like his own, in the love and confidence with"
218,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,which they curled themselves upon his great grey knee when the meal was
219,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"over. For his affection for children, his sense of fatherhood, was a"
220,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"predominant trait of Whitman's character. Lonely, since his mother's"
221,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"death, he had lived as regards the closer human relationships: lonely,"
222,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"in this sense, he was doomed to remain. A veil of secrecy hung over his"
223,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"past life, which none had ever ventured to lift. Rumours of a lost mate,"
224,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"as in the song of the Alabama bird upon the shore,--of children whom he"
225,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"never could claim,--hints of harsh fates and imperious destinies,"
226,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,occasionally penetrated that close-woven curtain of silence which
227,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,covered his most intimate self. But only in his poems had he voiced his
228,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"loneliness, and that with the tenderest poignancy of yearning for"
229,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"""better, loftier love's ideals, the divine wife, the sweet, eternal,"
230,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"perfect comrade""...."
231,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
232,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,That woman who passionately clung to me.
233,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Again we wander, we love, we separate again,"
234,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Again she holds me by the hand, I must not go,"
235,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,I see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous.
236,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
237,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,*       *       *       *       *
238,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
239,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"(Be not impatient--a little space--Know you, I salute the air, the"
240,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"ocean and the land,"
241,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Every day, at sundown, for your dear sake, my love.)"
242,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
243,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"And this was the man who had been blamed for his utter lack of ""the"
244,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"romantic attitude towards women!"" But Whitman was no light singer of"
245,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,casual empty love-lyrics; he was of sterner stuff than that.
246,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
247,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"No dainty dolce affettuoso I,"
248,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Bearded, sun-burnt, gray-neck'd, forbidding, I have arrived."
249,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
250,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,*       *       *       *       *
251,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
252,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"As breakfast passed, he spoke but little to his companions. His ordinary"
253,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"mood of ""quiet yet cheerful serenity,"" lay gently on him, and he was"
254,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"content to sit almost silent, emanating that radiant power, that"
255,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"""effluence and inclusiveness as of the sun,"" which none could fail to"
256,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"note in him. When addressed, he only replied with the brief monosyllable"
257,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"""Ay? Ay?"" (which he pronounced _Oy? Oy?_), and which, slightly inflected"
258,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"to answer various purposes, served him for all response."
259,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
260,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,[Illustration:
261,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
262,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,"
263,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Listen'd long and long....
264,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
265,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,(_Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking_).]
266,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
267,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"The meal was not yet over, for most of the family, when Whitman, rising"
268,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,abruptly with that startling _brusquerie_ which occasionally offended
269,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"his friends, observed ""Ta-ta!"" to everybody in general and departed--""as"
270,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"if he didn't care if he never saw us again!"" remarked one of the young"
271,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"men. He left the house and strolled down the green lane, to a wide"
272,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"wooded hollow, where the stream called Timber Creek went winding among"
273,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"its lily-leaves beneath the trees. Here Whitman had found, a year"
274,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"before, ""a particularly secluded little dell off one side by my"
275,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"creek ... filled with bushes, trees, grass, a group of willows, a"
276,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,straggling bank and a spring of delicious water running right through
277,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"the middle of it, with two or three little cascades. Here (he) retreated"
278,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"every hot day"" (_Specimen Days_),--and here, while the summer sun drew"
279,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"sweet aromatic odours from the tangled water-mints and cresses, he"
280,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"proceeded slowly now, carrying a portable chair, and with his pockets"
281,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"filled with note-books; for, as he truly avowed, ""Wherever I go, winter"
282,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"or summer, city or country, alone at home or travelling, I _must_ take"
283,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"notes."" He was about to make sure of a morning's unmitigated"
284,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"delight,--in the spot where he sought, ""every day, seclusion--every day"
285,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"at least two or three hours of freedom, bathing, no talk, no bonds, no"
286,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"dress, no books, no manners."""
287,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
288,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"And each step of the way was a pure joy to him. ""What a day!"" he"
289,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"murmured, ""what an hour just passing! the luxury of riant grass and"
290,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"blowing breeze, with all the shows of sun and sky and perfect"
291,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"temperature, never before so filling me body and soul!"" So rhapsodizing"
292,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"inwardly and drinking in the beauty of sight and sound, he proceeded,"
293,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"""still sauntering on, to the spring under the willows--musical as soft"
294,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"clinking glasses--pouring a sizeable stream, pure and clear, out from"
295,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,its vent where the bank arches over like a great brown shaggy eyebrow or
296,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"mouth-roof--gurgling, gurgling ceaselessly; meaning, saying something,"
297,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"of course (if one could only translate it.)"" (_Specimen Days._)"
298,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
299,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Here he sat down awhile and revelled in sheer joy of summer opulence. He
300,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"enumerated to himself,--laying a store of lovely recollections for"
301,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"future reference in darker days,--""The fervent heat, but so much more"
302,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"endurable in this pure air--the white and pink pond-blossoms, with great"
303,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"heart-shaped leaves, the glassy waters of the creek, the banks, with"
304,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,dense bushery and the picturesque beeches and shade and turf; the
305,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"tremulous, reedy call of some bird from recesses, breaking the warm,"
306,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"indolent, half-voluptuous silence: the prevailing delicate, yet"
307,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"palpable, spicy, grassy, clovery perfume to my nostrils,--and over all,"
308,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"encircling all, to my sight and soul, the free space of the sky,"
309,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"transparent and blue,"" (_Specimen Days_,) and, ""from old habit,"
310,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"pencilled down from time to time, almost automatically, moods, sights,"
311,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"hours, tints and outlines, on the spot."" Minutes like these were the"
312,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"seed time of his art, if that can be called art which was almost one"
313,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"with Nature. For Walt Whitman had, from the very outset, striven to"
314,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"obtain that fusion of identity with _Natura Benigna_, which, even if"
315,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"only momentary, bequeathes a lasting impression on the mind. He had"
316,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"always felt, with regard to his productions, that ""There is a"
317,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"humiliating lesson one learns, in serene hours, of a fine day or night."
318,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Nature seems to look on all fixed-up poetry and art as something almost
319,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"impertinent.... If I could indirectly show that we have met and fused,"
320,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"even if but only once, but enough--that we have really absorbed each"
321,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"other and understood each other,""--it sufficed him. Nothing less did:"
322,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"for he recognised that ""after you have exhausted what there is in"
323,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"business, politics, conviviality, love and so on--have found that none"
324,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"of these finally satisfy, or permanently wear--what remains? Nature"
325,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"remains: to bring out from their torpid recesses, the affinities of a"
326,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"man or woman with the open air, the trees, fields, changes of"
327,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"seasons--the sun by day and the stars of heaven by night."" And, while"
328,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"confessing, ""I cannot divest my appetite of literature, yet I find"
329,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,myself eventually trying it all by Nature--_first premises_ many call
330,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"it, but really the crowning results of all, laws, tallies and proofs...."
331,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"I have fancied the ocean and the daylight, the mountain and the forest,"
332,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,putting their spirit in a judgment on our books. I have fancied some
333,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"disembodied soul giving its verdict."" (_Specimen Days._) He was ""so"
334,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"afraid,"" as he phrased it, ""of dropping what smack of outdoors or sun or"
335,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,starlight might cling to the lines--I dared not try to meddle with or
336,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"smooth them."" To be ""made one with Nature,"" in a deeper sense than ever"
337,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"any man yet had known, was, in short, his ideal,--and, one may say, his"
338,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"achievement. For the verdict of the average person, vacant of _his_"

659,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"child-like simplicity, that woman-like tenderness, which constituted"
660,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,some of his chief charms.
661,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
662,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"They discussed the work of contemporary poets, English and American."
663,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Whitman, however much he differed from these in theory and method, gave"
664,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,generous homage to their varied genius. He loved to declaim the
665,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"_Ulysses_ and kindred majestically-rolling passages of Tennyson, in a"
666,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"clear, strong, rugged tone, devoid of all elocutionary tricks or"
667,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"affectation. He never spoke a line of his own verse, but to recite from"
668,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Shakespeare was a great pleasure to him: and he compared the
669,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Shakespearean plays to large, rich, splendid tapestry, like Raffaelle's"
670,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"historical cartoons, where everything is broad and colossal. For Scott,"
671,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"whose work, he said, breathed more of the open air than the workshop, he"
672,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,had unfeigned admiration. Dramatic work and music in all its forms he
673,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"discussed with knowledge and fervour. As for the poets of America, he"
674,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"poured encomium upon them ungrudgingly. ""I can't imagine any better luck"
675,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,befalling these States for a poetical beginning and initiation than has
676,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"come from Emerson, Longfellow, Bryant and Whittier."" (_Specimen Days._)"
677,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
678,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"The afternoon shadows stretched themselves out, and at sunset Mrs."
679,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Gilchrist and her children departed. It had been for her a memorable
680,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,afternoon: and Whitman had been thoroughly in his element as comrade of
681,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"so congenial a soul. Now, as the twilight deepened, he devoted himself"
682,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,to the consideration of the deepest notes in the whole diapason of human
683,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,existence. Never was a man of more exuberant a joy in life: never one
684,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"who gazed more courageously into the dim-veiled face of Death,--the"
685,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"sower of all enigmas, the comforter of all pain."
686,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
687,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Whispers of heavenly death, murmur'd I hear;"
688,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,Labial gossip of night--sibilant chorals;

694,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"time, is provided for, in the inherences of things;"
695,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"I do not think Life provides for all, and for Time and Space--but I"

700,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"And his heart once more, as in the matchless threnody for Lincoln, _When"
701,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed_, uttered its song of summons and"

703,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
704,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Come, lovely and soothing Death,"

713,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"The skies deepened into purple, and the march of the stars began: it was"
714,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"the sacredest hour of the day to Whitman, a period consecrated and set"
715,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"apart above all. ""I am convinced,"" thought he, ""that there are hours of"
716,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"Nature, especially of the atmosphere, mornings and evenings, addressed"

719,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,
720,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,And a new buoyancy quickened in his soul; the indomitable spirit of
721,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"enterprise revived within him. Now, at eleven at night, he was more"
722,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,exhilarated in mind than his body had been in the blue July morning:
723,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"and, casting one comprehensive glance upon the burning arcana of the"
724,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"heavens, that he might carry into his sleep a memory of that glory, he"
725,A DAY WITH WALT WHITMAN.,"""desired a better country,"" with longing and deep solicitude."
