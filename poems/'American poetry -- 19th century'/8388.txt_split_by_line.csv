58,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,
59,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"DEAR SCOTT,--Among various gifts which I have received from you, tangible"
60,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"and intangible, was a copy of the original quarto edition of Whitman's"
61,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"_Leaves of Grass_, which you presented to me soon after its first"
62,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,appearance in 1855. At a time when few people on this side of the Atlantic
63,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"had looked into the book, and still fewer had found in it anything save"
64,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"matter for ridicule, you had appraised it, and seen that its value was real"
65,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,and great. A true poet and a strong thinker like yourself was indeed likely
66,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"to see that. I read the book eagerly, and perceived that its substantiality"
67,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,and power were still ahead of any eulogium with which it might have come
68,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"commended to me--and, in fact, ahead of most attempts that could be made at"
69,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,verbal definition of them.
70,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,
71,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"Some years afterwards, getting to know our friend Swinburne, I found with"
72,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,much satisfaction that he also was an ardent (not of course a _blind_)
73,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"admirer of Whitman. Satisfaction, and a degree almost of surprise; for his"
74,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,intense sense of poetic refinement of form in his own works and his
75,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,exacting acuteness as a critic might have seemed likely to carry him away
76,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"from Whitman in sympathy at least, if not in actual latitude of perception."
77,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"Those who find the American poet ""utterly formless,"" ""intolerably rough and"
78,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"floundering,"" ""destitute of the A B C of art,"" and the like, might not"
79,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,unprofitably ponder this very different estimate of him by the author of
80,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,_Atalanta in Calydon_.
81,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,
82,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"May we hope that now, twelve years after the first appearance of _Leaves of"
83,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"Grass_, the English reading public may be prepared for a selection of"
84,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"Whitman's poems, and soon hereafter for a complete edition of them? I trust"
85,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"this may prove to be the case. At any rate, it has been a great"
86,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,gratification to me to be concerned in the experiment; and this is enhanced
87,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"by my being enabled to associate with it your name, as that of an early and"
88,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,"well-qualified appreciator of Whitman, and no less as that of a dear"
89,TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.,friend.

232,PREFATORY NOTICE.,PREFATORY NOTICE.
233,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
234,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
235,PREFATORY NOTICE.,During the summer of 1867 I had the opportunity (which I had often wished
236,PREFATORY NOTICE.,for) of expressing in print my estimate and admiration of the works of the
237,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"American poet Walt Whitman.[1] Like a stone dropped into a pond, an article"
238,PREFATORY NOTICE.,of that sort may spread out its concentric circles of consequences. One of
239,PREFATORY NOTICE.,these is the invitation which I have received to edit a selection from
240,PREFATORY NOTICE.,Whitman's writings; virtually the first sample of his work ever published
241,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"in England, and offering the first tolerably fair chance he has had of"
242,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"making his way with English readers on his own showing. Hitherto, such"
243,PREFATORY NOTICE.,readers--except the small percentage of them to whom it has happened to
244,PREFATORY NOTICE.,come across the poems in some one of their American editions--have picked
245,PREFATORY NOTICE.,acquaintance with them only through the medium of newspaper extracts and
246,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"criticisms, mostly short-sighted, sneering, and depreciatory, and rather"
247,PREFATORY NOTICE.,intercepting than forwarding the candid construction which people might be
248,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"willing to put upon the poems, alike in their beauties and their"
249,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"aberrations. Some English critics, no doubt, have been more discerning--as"
250,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"W. J. Fox, of old, in the _Dispatch_, the writer of the notice in the"
251,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"_Leader_, and of late two in the _Pall Mall Gazette_ and the _London"
252,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Review_;[2] but these have been the exceptions among us, the great majority"
253,PREFATORY NOTICE.,of the reviewers presenting that happy and familiar critical combination--
254,PREFATORY NOTICE.,scurrility and superciliousness.
255,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
256,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"[Footnote 1: See _The Chronicle_ for 6th July 1867, article _Walt Whitman's"
257,PREFATORY NOTICE.,Poems_.]
258,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
259,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"[Footnote 2: Since this Prefatory Notice was written [in 1868], another"
260,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"eulogistic review of Whitman has appeared--that by Mr. Robert Buchanan, in"
261,PREFATORY NOTICE.,the _Broadway_.]
262,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
263,PREFATORY NOTICE.,As it was my lot to set down so recently several of the considerations
264,PREFATORY NOTICE.,which seem to me most essential and most obvious in regard to Whitman's
265,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"writings, I can scarcely now recur to the subject without either repeating"
266,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"something of what I then said, or else leaving unstated some points of"
267,PREFATORY NOTICE.,principal importance. I shall therefore adopt the simplest course--that of
268,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"summarising the critical remarks in my former article; after which, I shall"
269,PREFATORY NOTICE.,leave without further development (ample as is the amount of development
270,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"most of them would claim) the particular topics there glanced at, and shall"
271,PREFATORY NOTICE.,proceed to some other phases of the subject.
272,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
273,PREFATORY NOTICE.,Whitman republished in 1867 his complete poetical works in one moderate-
274,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"sized volume, consisting of the whole _Leaves of Grass_, with a sort of"
275,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"supplement thereto named _Songs before Parting_,[3] and of the _Drum Taps_,"
276,PREFATORY NOTICE.,with its _Sequel_. It has been intimated that he does not expect to write
277,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"any more poems, unless it might be in expression of the religious side of"
278,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"man's nature. However, one poem on the last American harvest sown and"
279,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"reaped by those who had been soldiers in the great war, has already"
280,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"appeared since the volume in question, and has been republished in England."
281,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
282,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"[Footnote 3: In a copy of the book revised by Whitman himself, which we"
283,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"have seen, this title is modified into _Songs of Parting_.]"
284,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
285,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Whitman's poems present no trace of rhyme, save in a couple or so of chance"
286,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"instances. Parts of them, indeed, may be regarded as a warp of prose amid"
287,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the weft of poetry, such as Shakespeare furnishes the precedent for in"
288,PREFATORY NOTICE.,drama. Still there is a very powerful and majestic rhythmical sense
289,PREFATORY NOTICE.,throughout.
290,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
291,PREFATORY NOTICE.,Lavish and persistent has been the abuse poured forth upon Whitman by his
292,PREFATORY NOTICE.,own countrymen; the tricklings of the British press give but a moderate
293,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"idea of it. The poet is known to repay scorn with scorn. Emerson can,"
294,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"however, from the first be claimed as on Whitman's side; nor, it is"
295,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"understood after some inquiry, has that great thinker since then retreated"
296,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"from this position in fundamentals, although his admiration may have"
297,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"entailed some worry upon him, and reports of his recantation have been"
298,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"rife. Of other writers on Whitman's side, expressing themselves with no"
299,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"measured enthusiasm, one may cite Mr. M. D. Conway; Mr. W. D. O'Connor, who"
300,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"wrote a pamphlet named _The Good Grey Poet_; and Mr. John Burroughs, author"
301,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"of _Walt Whitman as Poet and Person_, published quite recently in New York."
302,PREFATORY NOTICE.,His thorough-paced admirers declare Whitman to be beyond rivalry _the_ poet
303,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"of the epoch; an estimate which, startling as it will sound at the first,"
304,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"may nevertheless be upheld, on the grounds that Whitman is beyond all his"
305,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"competitors a man of the period, one of audacious personal ascendant,"
306,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"incapable of all compromise, and an initiator in the scheme and form of his"
307,PREFATORY NOTICE.,works.
308,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
309,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Certain faults are charged against him, and, as far as they are true, shall"
310,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"frankly stand confessed--some of them as very serious faults. Firstly, he"
311,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"speaks on occasion of gross things in gross, crude, and plain terms."
312,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Secondly, he uses some words absurd or ill-constructed, others which"
313,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"produce a jarring effect in poetry, or indeed in any lofty literature."
314,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Thirdly, he sins from time to time by being obscure, fragmentary, and"
315,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"agglomerative--giving long strings of successive and detached items, not,"
316,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"however, devoid of a certain primitive effectiveness. Fourthly, his self-"
317,PREFATORY NOTICE.,assertion is boundless; yet not always to be understood as strictly or
318,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"merely personal to himself, but sometimes as vicarious, the poet speaking"
319,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"on behalf of all men, and every man and woman. These and any other faults"
320,PREFATORY NOTICE.,appear most harshly on a cursory reading; Whitman is a poet who bears and
321,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"needs to be read as a whole, and then the volume and torrent of his power"
322,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"carry the disfigurements along with it, and away."
323,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
324,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"The subject-matter of Whitman's poems, taken individually, is absolutely"
325,PREFATORY NOTICE.,miscellaneous: he touches upon any and every subject. But he has prefixed
326,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"to his last edition an ""Inscription"" in the following terms, showing that"
327,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the key-words of the whole book are two--""One's-self"" and ""En Masse:""--"
328,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
329,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Small is the theme of the following chant, yet the greatest.--namely,"
330,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"ONE'S-SELF; that wondrous thing, a simple separate person. That, for the"
331,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"use of the New World, I sing. Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I"
332,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"sing. Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the Muse: I say"
333,PREFATORY NOTICE.,the form complete is worthier far. The female equally with the male I sing.
334,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Nor cease at the theme of One's-self. I speak the word of the modern, the"
335,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"word EN MASSE. My days I sing, and the lands--with interstice I knew of"
336,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"hapless war. O friend, whoe'er you are, at last arriving hither to"
337,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"commence, I feel through every leaf the pressure of your hand, which I"
338,PREFATORY NOTICE.,return. And thus upon our journey linked together let us go.
339,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
340,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"The book, then, taken as a whole, is the poem both of Personality and of"
341,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Democracy; and, it may be added, of American nationalism. It is _par"
342,PREFATORY NOTICE.,excellence_ the modern poem. It is distinguished also by this peculiarity--
343,PREFATORY NOTICE.,that in it the most literal view of things is continually merging into the
344,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"most rhapsodic or passionately abstract. Picturesqueness it has, but mostly"
345,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"of a somewhat patriarchal kind, not deriving from the ""word-painting"" of"
346,PREFATORY NOTICE.,the _littérateur_; a certain echo of the old Hebrew poetry may even be
347,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"caught in it, extra-modern though it is. Another most prominent and"
348,PREFATORY NOTICE.,pervading quality of the book is the exuberant physique of the author. The
349,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"conceptions are throughout those of a man in robust health, and might alter"
350,PREFATORY NOTICE.,much under different conditions.
351,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
352,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Further, there is a strong tone of paradox in Whitman's writings. He is"
353,PREFATORY NOTICE.,both a realist and an optimist in extreme measure: he contemplates evil as
354,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"in some sense not existing, or, if existing, then as being of as much"
355,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"importance as anything else. Not that he is a materialist; on the contrary,"
356,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"he is a most strenuous assertor of the soul, and, with the soul, of the"
357,PREFATORY NOTICE.,body as its infallible associate and vehicle in the present frame of
358,PREFATORY NOTICE.,things. Neither does he drift into fatalism or indifferentism; the energy
359,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"of his temperament, and ever-fresh sympathy with national and other"
360,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"developments, being an effectual bar to this. The paradoxical element of"
361,PREFATORY NOTICE.,the poems is such that one may sometimes find them in conflict with what
362,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"has preceded, and would not be much surprised if they said at any moment"
363,PREFATORY NOTICE.,the reverse of whatever they do say. This is mainly due to the multiplicity
364,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"of the aspects of things, and to the immense width of relation in which"
365,PREFATORY NOTICE.,Whitman stands to all sorts and all aspects of them.
366,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
367,PREFATORY NOTICE.,But the greatest of this poet's distinctions is his absolute and entire
368,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"originality. He may be termed formless by those who, not without much"
369,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"reason to show for themselves, are wedded to the established forms and"
370,PREFATORY NOTICE.,ratified refinements of poetic art; but it seems reasonable to enlarge the
371,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"canon till it includes so great and startling a genius, rather than to draw"
372,PREFATORY NOTICE.,it close and exclude him. His work is practically certain to stand as
373,PREFATORY NOTICE.,archetypal for many future poetic efforts--so great is his power as an
374,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"originator, so fervid his initiative. It forms incomparably the _largest_"
375,PREFATORY NOTICE.,performance of our period in poetry. Victor Hugo's _Légende des Siècles_
376,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"alone might be named with it for largeness, and even that with much less of"
377,PREFATORY NOTICE.,a new starting-point in conception and treatment. Whitman breaks with all
378,PREFATORY NOTICE.,precedent. To what he himself perceives and knows he has a personal
379,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"relation of the intensest kind: to anything in the way of prescription, no"
380,PREFATORY NOTICE.,relation at all. But he is saved from isolation by the depth of his
381,PREFATORY NOTICE.,Americanism; with the movement of his predominant nation he is moved. His
382,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"comprehension, energy, and tenderness are all extreme, and all inspired by"
383,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"actualities. And, as for poetic genius, those who, without being ready to"
384,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"concede that faculty to Whitman, confess his iconoclastic boldness and his"
385,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Titanic power of temperament, working in the sphere of poetry, do in effect"
386,PREFATORY NOTICE.,confess his genius as well.
387,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
388,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Such, still further condensed, was the critical summary which I gave of"
389,PREFATORY NOTICE.,Whitman's position among poets. It remains to say something a little more
390,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"precise of the particular qualities of his works. And first, not to slur"
391,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"over defects, I shall extract some sentences from a letter which a friend,"
392,PREFATORY NOTICE.,most highly entitled to form and express an opinion on any poetic
393,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"question--one, too, who abundantly upholds the greatness of Whitman as a"
394,PREFATORY NOTICE.,poet--has addressed to me with regard to the criticism above condensed. His
395,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"observations, though severe on this individual point, appear to me not"
396,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"other than correct. ""I don't think that you quite put strength enough into"
397,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"your blame on one side, while you make at least enough of minor faults or"
398,PREFATORY NOTICE.,eccentricities. To me it seems always that Whitman's great flaw is a fault
399,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"of debility, not an excess of strength--I mean his bluster. His own"
400,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"personal and national self-reliance and arrogance, I need not tell you, I"
401,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"applaud, and sympathise and rejoice in; but the blatant ebullience of"
402,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"feeling and speech, at times, is feeble for so great a poet of so great a"
403,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"people. He is in part certainly the poet of democracy; but not wholly,"
404,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"_because_ he tries so openly to be, and asserts so violently that he is--"
405,PREFATORY NOTICE.,always as if he was fighting the case out on a platform. This is the only
406,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"thing I really or greatly dislike or revolt from. On the whole"" (adds my"
407,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"correspondent), ""my admiration and enjoyment of his greatness grow keener"
408,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"and warmer every time I think of him""--a feeling, I may be permitted to"
409,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"observe, which is fully shared by myself, and, I suppose, by all who"
410,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"consent in any adequate measure to recognise Whitman, and to yield"
411,PREFATORY NOTICE.,themselves to his influence.
412,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
413,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"To continue. Besides originality and daring, which have been already"
414,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"insisted upon, width and intensity are leading characteristics of his"
415,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"writings--width both of subject-matter and of comprehension, intensity of"
416,PREFATORY NOTICE.,self-absorption into what the poet contemplates and expresses. He scans and
417,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"presents an enormous panorama, unrolled before him as from a mountain-top;"
418,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"and yet, whatever most large or most minute or casual thing his eye glances"
419,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"upon, that he enters into with a depth of affection which identifies him"
420,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"with it for a time, be the object what it may. There is a singular"
421,PREFATORY NOTICE.,interchange also of actuality and of ideal substratum and suggestion. While
422,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"he sees men, with even abnormal exactness and sympathy, as men, he sees"
423,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"them also ""as trees walking,"" and admits us to perceive that the whole show"
424,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"is in a measure spectral and unsubstantial, and the mask of a larger and"
425,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"profounder reality beneath it, of which it is giving perpetual intimations"
426,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"and auguries. He is the poet indeed of literality, but of passionate and"
427,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"significant literality, full of indirections as well as directness, and of"
428,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"readings between the lines. If he is the 'cutest of Yankees, he is also as"
429,PREFATORY NOTICE.,truly an enthusiast as any the most typical poet. All his faculties and
430,PREFATORY NOTICE.,performance glow into a white heat of brotherliness; and there is a
431,PREFATORY NOTICE.,_poignancy_ both of tenderness and of beauty about his finer works which
432,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"discriminates them quite as much as their modernness, audacity, or any"
433,PREFATORY NOTICE.,other exceptional point. If the reader wishes to see the great and more
434,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"intimate powers of Whitman in their fullest expression, he may consult the"
435,PREFATORY NOTICE.,_Nocturn for the Death of Lincoln_; than which it would be difficult to
436,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"find anywhere a purer, more elevated, more poetic, more ideally abstract,"
437,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"or at the same time more pathetically personal, threnody--uniting the"
438,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"thrilling chords of grief, of beauty, of triumph, and of final unfathomed"
439,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"satisfaction. With all his singularities, Whitman is a master of words and"
440,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"of sounds: he has them at his command--made for, and instinct with, his"
441,PREFATORY NOTICE.,purpose--messengers of unsurpassable sympathy and intelligence between
442,PREFATORY NOTICE.,himself and his readers. The entire book may be called the paean of the
443,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"natural man--not of the merely physical, still less of the disjunctively"
444,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"intellectual or spiritual man, but of him who, being a man first and"
445,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"foremost, is therein also a spirit and an intellect."
446,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
447,PREFATORY NOTICE.,There is a singular and impressive intuition or revelation of Swedenborg's:
448,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"that the whole of heaven is in the form of one man, and the separate"
449,PREFATORY NOTICE.,societies of heaven in the forms of the several parts of man. In a large
450,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"sense, the general drift of Whitman's writings, even down to the passages"
451,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"which read as most bluntly physical, bear a striking correspondence or"
452,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"analogy to this dogma. He takes man, and every organism and faculty of man,"
453,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"as the unit--the datum--from which all that we know, discern, and"
454,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"speculate, of abstract and supersensual, as well as of concrete and"
455,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"sensual, has to be computed. He knows of nothing nobler than that unit man;"
456,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"but, knowing that, he can use it for any multiple, and for any dynamical"
457,PREFATORY NOTICE.,extension or recast.
458,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
459,PREFATORY NOTICE.,Let us next obtain some idea of what this most remarkable poet--the founder
460,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"of _American_ poetry rightly to be so called, and the most sonorous poetic"
461,PREFATORY NOTICE.,voice of the tangibilities of actual and prospective democracy--is in his
462,PREFATORY NOTICE.,proper life and person.
463,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
464,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Walt Whitman was born at the farm-village of West Hills, Long Island, in"
465,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the State of New York, and about thirty miles distant from the capital, on"
466,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the 31st of May 1819. His father's family, English by origin, had already"
467,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"been settled in this locality for five generations. His mother, named"
468,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Louisa van Velsor, was of Dutch extraction, and came from Cold Spring,"
469,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Queen's County, about three miles from West Hills. ""A fine-looking old"
470,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"lady"" she has been termed in her advanced age. A large family ensued from"
471,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the marriage. The father was a farmer, and afterwards a carpenter and"
472,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"builder; both parents adhered in religion to ""the great Quaker iconoclast,"
473,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Elias Hicks."" Walt was schooled at Brooklyn, a suburb of New York, and"
474,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"began life at the age of thirteen, working as a printer, later on as a"
475,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"country teacher, and then as a miscellaneous press-writer in New York. From"
476,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"1837 to 1848 he had, as Mr. Burroughs too promiscuously expresses it,"
477,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"""sounded all experiences of life, with all their passions, pleasures, and"
478,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"abandonments."" In 1849 he began travelling, and became at New Orleans a"
479,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"newspaper editor, and at Brooklyn, two years afterwards, a printer. He next"
480,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"followed his father's business of carpenter and builder. In 1862, after the"
481,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"breaking-out of the great Civil War, in which his enthusiastic unionism and"
482,PREFATORY NOTICE.,also his anti-slavery feelings attached him inseparably though not
483,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"rancorously to the good cause of the North, he undertook the nursing of the"
484,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"sick and wounded in the field, writing also a correspondence in the _New"
485,PREFATORY NOTICE.,York Times_. I am informed that it was through Emerson's intervention that
486,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"he obtained the sanction of President Lincoln for this purpose of charity,"
487,PREFATORY NOTICE.,with authority to draw the ordinary army rations; Whitman stipulating at
488,PREFATORY NOTICE.,the same time that he would not receive any remuneration for his services.
489,PREFATORY NOTICE.,The first immediate occasion of his going down to camp was on behalf of his
490,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"brother, Lieutenant-Colonel George W. Whitman, of the 51st New York"
491,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Veterans, who had been struck in the face by a piece of shell at"
492,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Fredericksburg. From the spring of 1863 this nursing, both in the field and"
493,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"more especially in hospital at Washington, became his ""one daily and"
494,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"nightly occupation;"" and the strongest testimony is borne to his"
495,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"measureless self-devotion and kindliness in the work, and to the unbounded"
496,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"fascination, a kind of magnetic attraction and ascendency, which he"
497,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"exercised over the patients, often with the happiest sanitary results."
498,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Northerner or Southerner, the belligerents received the same tending from"
499,PREFATORY NOTICE.,him. It is said that by the end of the war he had personally ministered to
500,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"upwards of 100,000 sick and wounded. In a Washington hospital he caught, in"
501,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the summer of 1864, the first illness he had ever known, caused by poison"
502,PREFATORY NOTICE.,absorbed into the system in attending some of the worst cases of gangrene.
503,PREFATORY NOTICE.,It disabled him for six months. He returned to the hospitals towards the
504,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"beginning of 1865, and obtained also a clerkship in the Department of the"
505,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Interior. It should be added that, though he never actually joined the army"
506,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"as a combatant, he made a point of putting down his name on the enrolment-"
507,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"lists for the draft, to take his chance as it might happen for serving the"
508,PREFATORY NOTICE.,country in arms. The reward of his devotedness came at the end of June
509,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"1865, in the form of dismissal from his clerkship by the minister, Mr."
510,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Harlan, who learned that Whitman was the author of the _Leaves of Grass_; a"
511,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"book whose outspokenness, or (as the official chief considered it)"
512,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"immorality, raised a holy horror in the ministerial breast. The poet,"
513,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"however, soon obtained another modest but creditable post in the office of"
514,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the Attorney-General. He still visits the hospitals on Sundays, and often"
515,PREFATORY NOTICE.,on other days as well.
516,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
517,PREFATORY NOTICE.,The portrait of Mr. Whitman reproduced in the present volume is taken from
518,PREFATORY NOTICE.,an engraving after a daguerreotype given in the original _Leaves of Grass_.
519,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"He is much above the average size, and noticeably well-proportioned--a"
520,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"model of physique and of health, and, by natural consequence, as fully and"
521,PREFATORY NOTICE.,finely related to all physical facts by his bodily constitution as to all
522,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"mental and spiritual facts by his mind and his consciousness. He is now,"
523,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"however, old-looking for his years, and might even (according to the"
524,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"statement of one of his enthusiasts, Mr. O'Connor) have passed for being"
525,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"beyond the age for the draft when the war was going on. The same gentleman,"
526,PREFATORY NOTICE.,in confutation of any inferences which might be drawn from the _Leaves of
527,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Grass_ by a Harlan or other Holy Willie, affirms that ""one more"
528,PREFATORY NOTICE.,irreproachable in his relations to the other sex lives not upon this
529,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"earth""--an assertion which one must take as one finds it, having neither"
530,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"confirmatory nor traversing evidence at hand. Whitman has light blue eyes,"
531,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"a florid complexion, a fleecy beard now grey, and a quite peculiar sort of"
532,PREFATORY NOTICE.,magnetism about him in relation to those with whom he comes in contact. His
533,PREFATORY NOTICE.,ordinary appearance is masculine and cheerful: he never shows depression of
534,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"spirits, and is sufficiently undemonstrative, and even somewhat silent in"
535,PREFATORY NOTICE.,company. He has always been carried by predilection towards the society of
536,PREFATORY NOTICE.,the common people; but is not the less for that open to refined and
537,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"artistic impressions--fond of operatic and other good music, and discerning"
538,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"in works of art. As to either praise or blame of what he writes, he is"
539,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"totally indifferent, not to say scornful--having in fact a very decisive"
540,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"opinion of his own concerning its calibre and destinies. Thoreau, a very"
541,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"congenial spirit, said of Whitman, ""He is Democracy;"" and again, ""After"
542,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"all, he suggests something a little more than human."" Lincoln broke out"
543,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"into the exclamation, ""Well, _he_ looks like a man!"" Whitman responded to"
544,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the instinctive appreciation of the President, considering him (it is said"
545,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"by Mr. Burroughs) ""by far the noblest and purest of the political"
546,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"characters of the time;"" and, if anything can cast, in the eyes of"
547,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"posterity, an added halo of brightness round the unsullied personal"
548,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"qualities and the great doings of Lincoln, it will assuredly be the written"
549,PREFATORY NOTICE.,monument reared to him by Whitman.
550,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
551,PREFATORY NOTICE.,The best sketch that I know of Whitman as an accessible human individual is
552,PREFATORY NOTICE.,that given by Mr. Conway.[4] I borrow from it the following few details.
553,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"""Having occasion to visit New York soon after the appearance of Walt"
554,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Whitman's book, I was urged by some friends to search him out.... The day"
555,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"was excessively hot, the thermometer at nearly 100°, and the sun blazed"
556,PREFATORY NOTICE.,down as only on sandy Long Island can the sun blaze.... I saw stretched
557,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"upon his back, and gazing up straight at the terrible sun, the man I was"
558,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"seeking. With his grey clothing, his blue-grey shirt, his iron-grey hair,"
559,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"his swart sunburnt face and bare neck, he lay upon the brown-and-white"
560,PREFATORY NOTICE.,grass--for the sun had burnt away its greenness--and was so like the earth
561,PREFATORY NOTICE.,upon which he rested that he seemed almost enough a part of it for one to
562,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"pass by without recognition. I approached him, gave my name and reason for"
563,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"searching him out, and asked him if he did not find the sun rather hot."
564,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"'Not at all too hot,' was his reply; and he confided to me that this was"
565,PREFATORY NOTICE.,one of his favourite places and attitudes for composing 'poems.' He then
566,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"walked with me to his home, and took me along its narrow ways to his room."
567,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"A small room of about fifteen feet square, with a single window looking out"
568,PREFATORY NOTICE.,on the barren solitudes of the island; a small cot; a wash-stand with a
569,PREFATORY NOTICE.,little looking-glass hung over it from a tack in the wall; a pine table
570,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"with pen, ink, and paper on it; an old line-engraving representing Bacchus,"
571,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"hung on the wall, and opposite a similar one of Silenus: these constituted"
572,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the visible environments of Walt Whitman. There was not, apparently, a"
573,PREFATORY NOTICE.,single book in the room.... The books he seemed to know and love best were
574,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare: these he owned, and probably had in his"
575,PREFATORY NOTICE.,pockets while we were talking. He had two studies where he read; one was
576,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the top of an omnibus, and the other a small mass of sand, then entirely"
577,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"uninhabited, far out in the ocean, called Coney Island.... The only"
578,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"distinguished contemporary he had ever met was the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher,"
579,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"of Brooklyn, who had visited him.... He confessed to having no talent for"
580,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"industry, and that his forte was 'loafing and writing poems:' he was poor,"
581,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"but had discovered that he could, on the whole, live magnificently on bread"
582,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"and water.... On no occasion did he laugh, nor indeed did I ever see him"
583,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"smile."""
584,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
585,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"[Footnote 4: In the _Fortnightly Review_, 15th October 1866.]"
586,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
587,PREFATORY NOTICE.,The first trace of Whitman as a writer is in the pages of the _Democratic
588,PREFATORY NOTICE.,Review_ in or about 1841. Here he wrote some prose tales and sketches--poor
589,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"stuff mostly, so far as I have seen of them, yet not to be wholly"
590,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"confounded with the commonplace. One of them is a tragic school-incident,"
591,PREFATORY NOTICE.,which may be surmised to have fallen under his personal observation in his
592,PREFATORY NOTICE.,early experience as a teacher. His first poem of any sort was named _Blood
593,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Money_, in denunciation of the Fugitive Slave Law, which severed him from"
594,PREFATORY NOTICE.,the Democratic party. His first considerable work was the _Leaves of
595,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Grass_. He began it in 1853, and it underwent two or three complete"
596,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"rewritings prior to its publication at Brooklyn in 1855, in a quarto"
597,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"volume--peculiar-looking, but with something perceptibly artistic about it."
598,PREFATORY NOTICE.,The type of that edition was set up entirely by himself. He was moved to
599,PREFATORY NOTICE.,undertake this formidable poetic work (as indicated in a private letter of
600,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Whitman's, from which Mr. Conway has given a sentence or two) by his sense"
601,PREFATORY NOTICE.,of the great materials which America could offer for a really American
602,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"poetry, and by his contempt for the current work of his"
603,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"compatriots--""either the poetry of an elegantly weak sentimentalism, at"
604,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"bottom nothing but maudlin puerilities or more or less musical verbiage,"
605,PREFATORY NOTICE.,arising out of a life of depression and enervation as their result; or else
606,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"that class of poetry, plays, &c., of which the foundation is feudalism,"
607,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"with its ideas of lords and ladies, its imported standard of gentility, and"
608,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the manners of European high-life-below-stairs in every line and verse."""
609,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Thus incited to poetic self-expression, Whitman (adds Mr. Conway) ""wrote on"
610,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"a sheet of paper, in large letters, these words, 'Make the Work,' and fixed"
611,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"it above his table, where he could always see it whilst writing."
612,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Thenceforth every cloud that flitted over him, every distant sail, every"
613,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"face and form encountered, wrote a line in his book."""
614,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
615,PREFATORY NOTICE.,The _Leaves of Grass_ excited no sort of notice until a letter from
616,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Emerson[5] appeared, expressing a deep sense of its power and magnitude. He"
617,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"termed it ""the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has"
618,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"yet contributed."""
619,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
620,PREFATORY NOTICE.,[Footnote 5: Mr. Burroughs (to whom I have recourse for most biographical
621,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"facts concerning Whitman) is careful to note, in order that no"
622,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"misapprehension may arise on the subject, that, up to the time of his"
623,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"publishing the _Leaves of Grass_, the author had not read either the essays"
624,PREFATORY NOTICE.,or the poems of Emerson.]
625,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
626,PREFATORY NOTICE.,The edition of about a thousand copies sold off in less than a year.
627,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Towards the end of 1856 a second edition in 16mo appeared, printed in New"
628,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"York, also of about a thousand copies. Its chief feature was an additional"
629,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"poem beginning ""A Woman waits for me."" It excited a considerable storm."
630,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Another edition, of about four to five thousand copies, duodecimo, came out"
631,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"at Boston in 1860-61, including a number of new pieces. The _Drum Taps_,"
632,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"consequent upon the war, with their _Sequel_, which comprises the poem on"
633,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Lincoln, followed in 1865; and in 1867, as I have already noted, a complete"
634,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"edition of all the poems, including a supplement named _Songs before"
635,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Parting_. The first of all the _Leaves of Grass_, in point of date, was the"
636,PREFATORY NOTICE.,long and powerful composition entitled _Walt Whitman_--perhaps the most
637,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"typical and memorable of all of his productions, but shut out from the"
638,PREFATORY NOTICE.,present selection for reasons given further on. The final edition shows
639,PREFATORY NOTICE.,numerous and considerable variations from all its precursors; evidencing
640,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"once again that Whitman is by no means the rough-and-ready writer,"
641,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"panoplied in rude art and egotistic self-sufficiency, that many people"
642,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"suppose him to be. Even since this issue, the book has been slightly"
643,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"revised by its author's own hand, with a special view to possible English"
644,PREFATORY NOTICE.,circulation. The copy so revised has reached me (through the liberal and
645,PREFATORY NOTICE.,friendly hands of Mr. Conway) after my selection had already been decided
646,PREFATORY NOTICE.,on; and the few departures from the last printed text which might on
647,PREFATORY NOTICE.,comparison be found in the present volume are due to my having had the
648,PREFATORY NOTICE.,advantage of following this revised copy. In all other respects I have felt
649,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"bound to reproduce the last edition, without so much as considering whether"
650,PREFATORY NOTICE.,here and there I might personally prefer the readings of the earlier
651,PREFATORY NOTICE.,issues.
652,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
653,PREFATORY NOTICE.,The selection here offered to the English reader contains a little less
654,PREFATORY NOTICE.,than half the entire bulk of Whitman's poetry. My choice has proceeded upon
655,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"two simple rules: first, to omit entirely every poem which could with any"
656,PREFATORY NOTICE.,tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings of morals or
657,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"propriety in this peculiarly nervous age; and, second, to include every"
658,PREFATORY NOTICE.,remaining poem which appeared to me of conspicuous beauty or interest. I
659,PREFATORY NOTICE.,have also inserted the very remarkable prose preface which Whitman printed
660,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"in the original edition of _Leaves of Grass_, an edition that has become a"
661,PREFATORY NOTICE.,literary rarity. This preface has not been reproduced in any later
662,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"publication, although its materials have to some extent been worked up into"
663,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"poems of a subsequent date.[6] From this prose composition, contrary to"
664,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"what has been my rule with any of the poems, it has appeared to me"
665,PREFATORY NOTICE.,permissible to omit two or three short phrases which would have shocked
666,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"ordinary readers, and the retention of which, had I held it obligatory,"
667,PREFATORY NOTICE.,would have entailed the exclusion of the preface itself as a whole.
668,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
669,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"[Footnote 6: Compare, for instance, the Preface, pp. 38, 39, with the poem"
670,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"_To a Foiled Revolter or Revoltress_, p. 133.]"
671,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
672,PREFATORY NOTICE.,A few words must be added as to the indecencies scattered through Whitman's
673,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"writings. Indecencies or improprieties--or, still better, deforming"
674,PREFATORY NOTICE.,crudities--they may rightly be termed; to call them immoralities would be
675,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"going too far. Whitman finds himself, and other men and women, to be a"
676,PREFATORY NOTICE.,compound of soul and body; he finds that body plays an extremely prominent
677,PREFATORY NOTICE.,and determining part in whatever he and other mundane dwellers have
678,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"cognisance of; he perceives this to be the necessary condition of things,"
679,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"and therefore, as he fully and openly accepts it, the right condition; and"
680,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"he knows of no reason why what is universally seen and known, necessary and"
681,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"right, should not also be allowed and proclaimed in speech. That such a"
682,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"view of the matter is entitled to a great deal of weight, and at any rate"
683,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"to candid consideration and construction, appears to me not to admit of a"
684,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"doubt: neither is it dubious that the contrary view, the only view which a"
685,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"mealy-mouthed British nineteenth century admits as endurable, amounts to"
686,PREFATORY NOTICE.,the condemnation of nearly every great or eminent literary work of past
687,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"time, whatever the century it belongs to, the country it comes from, the"
688,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"department of writing it illustrates, or the degree or sort of merit it"
689,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"possesses. Tenth, second, or first century before Christ--first, eighth,"
690,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, or even eighteenth century"
691,PREFATORY NOTICE.,A.D.--it is still the same: no book whose subject-matter admits as possible
692,PREFATORY NOTICE.,of an impropriety according to current notions can be depended upon to fail
693,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"of containing such impropriety,--can, if those notions are accepted as the"
694,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"canon, be placed with a sense of security in the hands of girls and youths,"
695,PREFATORY NOTICE.,or read aloud to women; and this holds good just as much of severely moral
696,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"or plainly descriptive as of avowedly playful, knowing, or licentious"
697,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"books. For my part, I am far from thinking that earlier state of"
698,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"literature, and the public feeling from which it sprang, the wrong ones--"
699,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"and our present condition the only right one. Equally far, therefore, am I"
700,PREFATORY NOTICE.,from indignantly condemning Whitman for every startling allusion or
701,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"expression which he has admitted into his book, and which I, from motives"
702,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"of policy, have excluded from this selection; except, indeed, that I think"
703,PREFATORY NOTICE.,many of his tabooed passages are extremely raw and ugly on the ground of
704,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"poetic or literary art, whatever aspect they may bear in morals. I have"
705,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"been rigid in exclusion, because it appears to me highly desirable that a"
706,PREFATORY NOTICE.,fair verdict on Whitman should now be pronounced in England on poetic
707,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"grounds alone; and because it was clearly impossible that the book, with"
708,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"its audacities of topic and of expression included, should run the same"
709,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"chance of justice, and of circulation through refined minds and hands,"
710,PREFATORY NOTICE.,which may possibly be accorded to it after the rejection of all such
711,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"peccant poems. As already intimated, I have not in a single instance"
712,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"excised any _parts_ of poems: to do so would have been, I conceive, no less"
713,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"wrongful towards the illustrious American than repugnant, and indeed"
714,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"unendurable, to myself, who aspire to no Bowdlerian honours. The"
715,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"consequence is, that the reader loses _in toto_ several important poems,"
716,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"and some extremely fine ones--notably the one previously alluded to, of"
717,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"quite exceptional value and excellence, entitled _Walt Whitman_. I"
718,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"sacrifice them grudgingly; and yet willingly, because I believe this to be"
719,PREFATORY NOTICE.,the only thing to do with due regard to the one reasonable object which a
720,PREFATORY NOTICE.,selection can subserve--that of paving the way towards the issue and
721,PREFATORY NOTICE.,unprejudiced reception of a complete edition of the poems in England. For
722,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the benefit of misconstructionists, let me add in distinct terms that, in"
723,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"respect of morals and propriety, I neither admire nor approve the"
724,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"incriminated passages in Whitman's poems, but, on the contrary, consider"
725,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"that most of them would be much better away; and, in respect of art, I"
726,PREFATORY NOTICE.,doubt whether even one of them deserves to be retained in the exact
727,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"phraseology it at present exhibits. This, however, does not amount to"
728,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"saying that Whitman is a vile man, or a corrupt or corrupting writer; he is"
729,PREFATORY NOTICE.,none of these.
730,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
731,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"The only division of his poems into sections, made by Whitman himself, has"
732,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"been noted above: _Leaves of Grass_, _Songs before Parting_, supplementary"
733,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"to the preceding, and _Drum Taps_, with their _Sequel_. The peculiar title,"
734,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"_Leaves of Grass_, has become almost inseparable from the name of Whitman;"
735,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"it seems to express with some aptness the simplicity, universality, and"
736,PREFATORY NOTICE.,spontaneity of the poems to which it is applied. _Songs before Parting_ may
737,PREFATORY NOTICE.,indicate that these compositions close Whitman's poetic roll. _Drum Taps_
738,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"are, of course, songs of the Civil War, and their _Sequel_ is mainly on the"
739,PREFATORY NOTICE.,same theme: the chief poem in this last section being the one on the death
740,PREFATORY NOTICE.,of Lincoln. These titles all apply to fully arranged series of
741,PREFATORY NOTICE.,compositions. The present volume is not in the same sense a fully arranged
742,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"series, but a selection: and the relation of the poems _inter se_ appears"
743,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"to me to depend on altered conditions, which, however narrowed they are, it"
744,PREFATORY NOTICE.,may be as well frankly to recognise in practice. I have therefore
745,PREFATORY NOTICE.,redistributed the poems (a latitude of action which I trust the author may
746,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"not object to), bringing together those whose subject-matter seems to"
747,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"warrant it, however far separated they may possibly be in the original"
748,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"volume. At the same time, I have retained some characteristic terms used by"
749,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Whitman himself, and have named my sections respectively--"
750,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
751,PREFATORY NOTICE.,1. Chants Democratic (poems of democracy).
752,PREFATORY NOTICE.,2. Drum Taps (war songs).
753,PREFATORY NOTICE.,3. Walt Whitman (personal poems).
754,PREFATORY NOTICE.,4. Leaves of Grass (unclassified poems).
755,PREFATORY NOTICE.,5. Songs of Parting (missives).
756,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
757,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"The first three designations explain themselves. The fourth, _Leaves of"
758,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Grass_, is not so specially applicable to the particular poems of that"
759,PREFATORY NOTICE.,section here as I should have liked it to be; but I could not consent to
760,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"drop this typical name. The _Songs of Parting_, my fifth section, are"
761,PREFATORY NOTICE.,compositions in which the poet expresses his own sentiment regarding his
762,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"works, in which he forecasts their future, or consigns them to the reader's"
763,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"consideration. It deserves mention that, in the copy of Whitman's last"
764,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"American edition revised by his own hand, as previously noticed, the series"
765,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"termed _Songs of Parting_ has been recast, and made to consist of poems of"
766,PREFATORY NOTICE.,the same character as those included in my section No. 5.
767,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
768,PREFATORY NOTICE.,Comparatively few of Whitman's poems have been endowed by himself with
769,PREFATORY NOTICE.,titles properly so called. Most of them are merely headed with the opening
770,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"words of the poems themselves--as ""I was looking a long while;"" ""To get"
771,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"betimes in Boston Town;"" ""When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed;"" and"
772,PREFATORY NOTICE.,so on. It seems to me that in a selection such a lengthy and circuitous
773,PREFATORY NOTICE.,method of identifying the poems is not desirable: I should wish them to be
774,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"remembered by brief, repeatable, and significant titles. I have therefore"
775,PREFATORY NOTICE.,supplied titles of my own to such pieces as bear none in the original
776,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"edition: wherever a real title appears in that edition, I have retained it."
777,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
778,PREFATORY NOTICE.,With these remarks I commend to the English reader the ensuing selection
779,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"from a writer whom I sincerely believe to be, whatever his faults, of the"
780,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"order of _great_ poets, and by no means of pretty good ones. I would urge"
781,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"the reader not to ask himself, and not to return any answer to the"
782,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"questions, whether or not this poet is like other poets--whether or not the"
783,PREFATORY NOTICE.,particular application of rules of art which is found to hold good in the
784,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"works of those others, and to constitute a part of their excellence, can be"
785,PREFATORY NOTICE.,traced also in Whitman. Let the questions rather be--Is he powerful? Is he
786,PREFATORY NOTICE.,American? Is he new? Is he rousing? Does he feel and make me feel? I
787,PREFATORY NOTICE.,entertain no doubt as to the response which in due course of time will be
788,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"returned to these questions and such as these, in America, in England, and"
789,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"elsewhere--or to the further question, ""Is Whitman then indeed a true and a"
790,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"great poet?"" Lincoln's verdict bespeaks the ultimate decision upon him, in"
791,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"his books as in his habit as he lives--""Well, _he_ looks like a man."""
792,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
793,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Walt Whitman occupies at the present moment a unique position on the globe,"
794,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"and one which, even in past time, can have been occupied by only an"
795,PREFATORY NOTICE.,infinitesimally small number of men. He is the one man who entertains and
796,PREFATORY NOTICE.,professes respecting himself the grave conviction that he is the actual and
797,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"prospective founder of a new poetic literature, and a great one--a"
798,PREFATORY NOTICE.,literature proportional to the material vastness and the unmeasured
799,PREFATORY NOTICE.,destinies of America: he believes that the Columbus of the continent or the
800,PREFATORY NOTICE.,Washington of the States was not more truly than himself in the future a
801,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"founder and upbuilder of this America. Surely a sublime conviction, and"
802,PREFATORY NOTICE.,expressed more than once in magnificent words--none more so than the lines
803,PREFATORY NOTICE.,beginning
804,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
805,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"""Come, I will make this continent indissoluble.""[7]"
806,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
807,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"[Footnote 7: See the poem headed _Love of Comrades_, p. 308.]"
808,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
809,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Were the idea untrue, it would still be a glorious dream, which a man of"
810,PREFATORY NOTICE.,genius might be content to live in and die for: but is it untrue? Is it
811,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"not, on the contrary, true, if not absolutely, yet with a most genuine and"
812,PREFATORY NOTICE.,substantial approximation? I believe it _is_ thus true. I believe that
813,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"Whitman is one of the huge, as yet mainly unrecognised, forces of our time;"
814,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"privileged to evoke, in a country hitherto still asking for its poet, a"
815,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"fresh, athletic, and American poetry, and predestined to be traced up to by"
816,PREFATORY NOTICE.,generation after generation of believing and ardent--let us hope not
817,PREFATORY NOTICE.,servile--disciples.
818,PREFATORY NOTICE.,
819,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"""Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world."" Shelley, who knew"
820,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"what he was talking about when poetry was the subject, has said it, and"
821,PREFATORY NOTICE.,with a profundity of truth Whitman seems in a peculiar degree marked out
822,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"for ""legislation"" of the kind referred to. His voice will one day be"
823,PREFATORY NOTICE.,potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken--that is
824,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"to say, in the four corners of the earth; and in his own American"
825,PREFATORY NOTICE.,"hemisphere, the uttermost avatars of democracy will confess him not more"
826,PREFATORY NOTICE.,their announcer than their inspirer.

858,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"The Americans, of all nations at any time upon the earth, have probably the"
859,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,fullest poetical Nature. The United States themselves are essentially the
860,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,greatest poem. In the history of the earth hitherto the largest and most
861,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,stirring appear tame and orderly to their ampler largeness and stir. Here
862,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,at last is something in the doings of man that corresponds with the

865,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"blind to particulars and details, magnificently moving in vast masses."
866,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
867,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,Here is the hospitality which for ever indicates heroes. Here are the
868,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,roughs and beards and space and ruggedness and nonchalance that the soul
869,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"loves. Here the performance, disdaining the trivial, unapproached in the"
870,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,tremendous audacity of its crowds and groupings and the push of its
871,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"perspective, spreads with crampless and flowing breadth, and showers its"
872,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,prolific and splendid extravagance. One sees it must indeed own the riches
873,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"of the summer and winter, and need never be bankrupt while corn grows from"

895,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,The largeness of nature or the nation were monstrous without a

897,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"nature, nor swarming states, nor streets and steamships, nor prosperous"

905,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,demonstrable must fall behind that of the mythical! As if men do not make

914,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,The American poets are to enclose old and new; for America is the race of
915,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,races. Of them a bard is to be commensurate with a people. To him the other
916,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,continents arrive as contributions: he gives them reception for their sake
917,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,and his own sake. His spirit responds to his country's spirit: he
918,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,incarnates its geography and natural life and rivers and lakes. Mississippi
919,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"with annual freshets and changing chutes, Missouri and Columbia and Ohio"

960,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the Yankee swap--the New York firemen and the target excursion--the
961,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,Southern plantation life--the character of the north-east and of the north-

963,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"protect it, and the stern opposition to it which shall never cease till it"
964,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"ceases, or the speaking of tongues and the moving of lips cease. For such"
965,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the expression of the American poet is to be transcendent and new. It is to
966,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"be indirect, and not direct or descriptive or epic. Its quality goes"
967,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,through these to much more. Let the age and wars of other nations be
968,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"chanted, and their eras and characters be illustrated, and that finish the"
969,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"verse. Not so the great psalm of the republic. Here the theme is creative,"
970,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and has vista. Here comes one among the well-beloved stone-cutters, and"
971,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"plans with decision and science, and sees the solid and beautiful forms of"
972,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the future where there are now no solid forms.
973,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
974,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"Of all nations, the United States, with veins full of poetical stuff, most"
975,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"needs poets, and will doubtless have the greatest, and use them the"
976,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,greatest. Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as
977,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"their poets shall. Of all mankind, the great poet is the equable man. Not"
978,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"in him, but off from him, things are grotesque or eccentric, or fail of"
979,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"their sanity. Nothing out of its place is good, and nothing in its place is"
980,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"bad. He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportions, neither"
981,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"more nor less. He is the arbiter of the diverse, and he is the key. He is"
982,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the equaliser of his age and land: he supplies what wants supplying, and"
983,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"checks what wants checking. If peace is the routine, out of him speaks the"
984,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building vast and populous cities,"
985,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,encouraging agriculture and the arts and commerce--lighting the study of
986,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"man, the soul, immortality--federal, state or municipal government,"
987,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"marriage, health, free-trade, intertravel by land and sea--nothing too"
988,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"close, nothing too far off,--the stars not too far off. In war, he is the"
989,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,most deadly force of the war. Who recruits him recruits horse and foot: he
990,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"fetches parks of artillery, the best that engineer ever knew. If the time"
991,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"becomes slothful and heavy, he knows how to arouse it: he can make every"
992,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,word he speaks draw blood. Whatever stagnates in the flat of custom or
993,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"obedience or legislation, he never stagnates. Obedience does not master"
994,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"him, he masters it. High up out of reach, he stands turning a concentrated"
995,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,light; he turns the pivot with his finger; he baffles the swiftest runners
996,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"as he stands, and easily overtakes and envelops them. The time straying"
997,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,toward infidelity and confections and persiflage he withholds by his steady
998,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,faith; he spreads out his dishes; he offers the sweet firm-fibred meat that
999,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"grows men and women. His brain is the ultimate brain. He is no arguer, he"
1000,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"is judgment. He judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling"
1001,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"around a helpless thing. As he sees the farthest, he has the most faith."
1002,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things. In the talk on the soul
1003,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and eternity and God, off of his equal plane, he is silent. He sees"
1004,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement: he sees eternity
1005,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"in men and women,--he does not see men and women as dreams or dots. Faith"
1006,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"is the antiseptic of the soul,--it pervades the common people and preserves"
1007,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,them: they never give up believing and expecting and trusting. There is
1008,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,that indescribable freshness and unconsciousness about an illiterate person
1009,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius. The poet
1010,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,sees for a certainty how one not a great artist may be just as sacred and
1011,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,perfect as the greatest artist. The power to destroy or remould is freely
1012,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"used by him, but never the power of attack. What is past is past. If he"
1013,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"does not expose superior models, and prove himself by every step he takes,"
1014,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,he is not what is wanted. The presence of the greatest poet conquers; not
1015,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,parleying or struggling or any prepared attempts. Now he has passed that
1016,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"way, see after him! there is not left any vestige of despair or misanthropy"
1017,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or cunning or exclusiveness, or the ignominy of a nativity or colour, or"
1018,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,delusion of hell or the necessity of hell; and no man thenceforward shall
1019,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,be degraded for ignorance or weakness or sin.
1020,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1021,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,The greatest poet hardly knows pettiness or triviality. If he breathes into
1022,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"anything that was before thought small, it dilates with the grandeur and"
1023,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,life of the universe. He is a seer--he is individual--he is complete in
1024,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"himself: the others are as good as he; only he sees it, and they do not. He"
1025,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,is not one of the chorus--he does not stop for any regulation--he is the
1026,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,President of regulation. What the eyesight does to the rest he does to the
1027,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,rest. Who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight? The other senses
1028,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"corroborate themselves, but this is removed from any proof but its own, and"
1029,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,foreruns the identities of the spiritual world. A single glance of it mocks
1030,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"all the investigations of man, and all the instruments and books of the"
1031,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"earth, and all reasoning. What is marvellous? what is unlikely? what is"
1032,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,impossible or baseless or vague? after you have once just opened the space
1033,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"of a peachpit, and given audience to far and near and to the sunset, and"
1034,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"had all things enter with electric swiftness, softly and duly, without"
1035,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,confusion or jostling or jam.
1036,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1037,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"The land and sea, the animals, fishes, and birds, the sky of heaven and the"
1038,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"orbs, the forests, mountains, and rivers, are not small themes: but folks"
1039,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,expect of the poet to indicate more than the beauty and dignity which
1040,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"always attach to dumb real objects,--they expect him to indicate the path"
1041,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,between reality and their souls. Men and women perceive the beauty well
1042,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"enough--probably as well as he. The passionate tenacity of hunters,"
1043,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"woodmen, early risers, cultivators of gardens and orchards and fields, the"
1044,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"love of healthy women for the manly form, seafaring persons, drivers of"
1045,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"horses, the passion for light and the open air, all is an old varied sign"
1046,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"of the unfailing perception of beauty, and of a residence of the poetic, in"
1047,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"outdoor people. They can never be assisted by poets to perceive: some may,"
1048,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,but they never can. The poetic quality is not marshalled in rhyme or
1049,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"uniformity, or abstract addresses to things, nor in melancholy complaints"
1050,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or good precepts, but is the life of these and much else, and is in the"
1051,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more
1052,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"luxuriant rhyme; and of uniformity, that it conveys itself into its own"
1053,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and uniformity of perfect poems
1054,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"show the free growth of metrical laws, and bud from them as unerringly and"
1055,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"loosely as lilacs or roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the"
1056,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"shapes of chestnuts and oranges and melons and pears, and shed the perfume"
1057,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,impalpable to form. The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems or music
1058,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or orations or recitations are not independent, but dependent. All beauty"
1059,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the greatnesses are in
1060,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"conjunction in a man or woman, it is enough--the fact will prevail through"
1061,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the universe: but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not prevail.
1062,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost. This is what
1063,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"you shall do: love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give"
1064,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your"
1065,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"income and labour to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have"
1066,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"patience and indulgence towards the people, take off your hat to nothing"
1067,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful"
1068,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families,"
1069,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life,"
1070,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book,"
1071,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,dismiss whatever insults your own soul; and your very flesh shall be a
1072,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"great poem, and have the richest fluency, not only in its words, but in the"
1073,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"silent lines of its lips and face, and between the lashes of your eyes, and"
1074,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,in every motion and joint of your body. The poet shall not spend his time
1075,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,in unneeded work. He shall know that the ground is always ready ploughed
1076,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and manured: others may not know it, but he shall. He shall go directly to"
1077,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the creation. His trust shall master the trust of everything he touches,"
1078,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,and shall master all attachment.
1079,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1080,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"The known universe has one complete lover, and that is the greatest poet."
1081,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"He consumes an eternal passion, and is indifferent which chance happens,"
1082,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and which possible contingency of fortune or misfortune, and persuades"
1083,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,daily and hourly his delicious pay. What balks or breaks others is fuel for
1084,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,his burning progress to contact and amorous joy. Other proportions of the
1085,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,reception of pleasure dwindle to nothing to his proportions. All expected
1086,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,from heaven or from the highest he is rapport with in the sight of the
1087,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"daybreak, or a scene of the winter woods, or the presence of children"
1088,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"playing, or with his arm round the neck of a man or woman. His love, above"
1089,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"all love, has leisure and expanse--he leaves room ahead of himself. He is"
1090,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,no irresolute or suspicious lover--he is sure--he scorns intervals. His
1091,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,experience and the showers and thrills are not for nothing. Nothing can jar
1092,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,him: suffering and darkness cannot--death and fear cannot. To him complaint
1093,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,and jealousy and envy are corpses buried and rotten in the earth--he saw
1094,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"them buried. The sea is not surer of the shore, or the shore of the sea,"
1095,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"than he is of the fruition of his love, and of all perfection and beauty."
1096,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1097,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,The fruition of beauty is no chance of hit or miss--it is inevitable as
1098,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,life--it is exact and plumb as gravitation. From the eyesight proceeds
1099,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"another eyesight, and from the hearing proceeds another hearing, and from"
1100,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the voice proceeds another voice, eternally curious of the harmony of"
1101,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"things with man. To these respond perfections, not only in the committees"
1102,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"that were supposed to stand for the rest, but in the rest themselves just"
1103,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the same. These understand the law of perfection in masses and floods--that
1104,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,its finish is to each for itself and onward from itself--that it is profuse
1105,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and impartial--that there is not a minute of the light or dark, nor an acre"
1106,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"of the earth or sea, without it--nor any direction of the sky, nor any"
1107,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"trade or employment, nor any turn of events. This is the reason that about"
1108,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the proper expression of beauty there is precision and balance,--one part"
1109,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,does not need to be thrust above another. The best singer is not the one
1110,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,who has the most lithe and powerful organ: the pleasure of poems is not in
1111,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,them that take the handsomest measure and similes and sound.
1112,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1113,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"Without effort, and without exposing in the least how it is done, the"
1114,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,greatest poet brings the spirit of any or all events and passions and
1115,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"scenes and persons, some more and some less, to bear on your individual"
1116,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"character, as you hear or read. To do this well is to compete with the laws"
1117,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"that pursue and follow time. What is the purpose must surely be there, and"
1118,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the clue of it must be there; and the faintest indication is the indication
1119,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"of the best, and then becomes the clearest indication. Past and present and"
1120,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"future are not disjoined, but joined. The greatest poet forms the"
1121,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,consistence of what is to be from what has been and is. He drags the dead
1122,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"out of their coffins, and stands them again on their feet: he says to the"
1123,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"past, Rise and walk before me that I may realise you. He learns the"
1124,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,lesson--he places himself where the future becomes present. The greatest
1125,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,poet does not only dazzle his rays over character and scenes and
1126,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"passions,--he finally ascends and finishes all: he exhibits the pinnacles"
1127,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,that no man can tell what they are for or what is beyond--he glows a moment
1128,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,on the extremest verge. He is most wonderful in his last half-hidden smile
1129,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,or frown: by that flash of the moment of parting the one that sees it shall
1130,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,be encouraged or terrified afterward for many years. The greatest poet does
1131,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"not moralise or make applications of morals,--he knows the soul. The soul"
1132,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,has that measureless pride which consists in never acknowledging any
1133,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"lessons but its own. But it has sympathy as measureless as its pride, and"
1134,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the one balances the other, and neither can stretch too far while it"
1135,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,stretches in company with the other. The inmost secrets of art sleep with
1136,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the twain. The greatest poet has lain close betwixt both, and they are"
1137,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,vital in his style and thoughts.
1138,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1139,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of"
1140,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"letters, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity,--nothing can"
1141,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,make up for excess or for the lack of definiteness. To carry on the heave
1142,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"of impulse, and pierce intellectual depths, and give all subjects their"
1143,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But to speak in"
1144,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,literature with the perfect rectitude and insousiance of the movements of
1145,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods"
1146,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and grass by the roadside, is the flawless triumph of art. If you, have"
1147,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"looked on him who has achieved it, you have looked on one of the masters of"
1148,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the artists of all nations and times. You shall not contemplate the flight
1149,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"of the grey-gull over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the blood-horse,"
1150,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or the tall leaning of sunflowers on their stalk, or the appearance of the"
1151,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"sun journeying through heaven, or the appearance of the moon afterward,"
1152,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him. The greatest
1153,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and"
1154,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself."
1155,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"He swears to his art,--I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my"
1156,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,writing any elegance or effect or originality to hang in the way between me
1157,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and the rest like curtains. I will have nothing hang in the way, not the"
1158,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,richest curtains. What I tell I tell for precisely what it is. Let who may
1159,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"exalt or startle or fascinate or soothe, I will have purposes as health or"
1160,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"heat or snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or"
1161,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,pourtray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition.
1162,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"You shall stand by my side, and look in the mirror with me."
1163,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1164,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,The old red blood and stainless gentility of great poets will be proved by
1165,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,their unconstraint. A heroic person walks at his ease through and out of
1166,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,that custom or precedent or authority that suits him not. Of the traits of
1167,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the brotherhood of writers, savans, musicians, inventors, and artists,"
1168,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,nothing is finer than silent defiance advancing from new free forms. In the
1169,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"need of poems, philosophy, politics, mechanism, science, behaviour, the"
1170,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"craft of art, an appropriate native grand opera, shipcraft or any craft, he"
1171,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,is greatest for ever and for ever who contributes the greatest original
1172,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,practical example. The cleanest expression is that which finds no sphere
1173,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"worthy of itself, and makes one."
1174,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1175,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"The messages of great poets to each man and woman are,--Come to us on equal"
1176,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"terms, only then can you understand us. We are no better than you; what we"
1177,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"enclose you enclose, what we enjoy you may enjoy. Did you suppose there"
1178,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"could be only one Supreme? We affirm there can be unnumbered Supremes, and"
1179,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,that one does not countervail another any more than one eyesight
1180,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,countervails another--and that men can be good or grand only of the
1181,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,consciousness of their supremacy within them. What do you think is the
1182,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"grandeur of storms and dismemberments, and the deadliest battles and"
1183,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"wrecks, and the wildest fury of the elements, and the power of the sea, and"
1184,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the motion of nature, and of the throes of human desires, and dignity and"
1185,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"hate and love? It is that something in the soul which says,--Rage on, whirl"
1186,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"on, I tread master here and everywhere; master of the spasms of the sky and"
1187,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"of the shatter of the sea, master of nature and passion and death, and of"
1188,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,all terror and all pain.
1189,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1190,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,The American bards shall be marked for generosity and affection and for
1191,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,encouraging competitors: they shall be kosmos--without monopoly or
1192,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,secrecy--glad to pass anything to any one--hungry for equals night and day.
1193,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"They shall not be careful of riches and privilege,--they shall be riches"
1194,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,and privilege: they shall perceive who the most affluent man is. The most
1195,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,affluent man is he that confronts all the shows he sees by equivalents out
1196,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,of the stronger wealth of himself. The American bard shall delineate no
1197,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"class of persons, nor one or two out of the strata of interests, nor love"
1198,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"most nor truth most, nor the soul most nor the body most; and not be for"
1199,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the eastern states more than the western, or the northern states more than"
1200,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the southern.
1201,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1202,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,Exact science and its practical movements are no checks on the greatest
1203,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"poet, but always his encouragement and support. The outset and remembrance"
1204,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,are there--there the arms that lifted him first and brace him best--there
1205,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"he returns after all his goings and comings. The sailor and traveller, the"
1206,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"anatomist, chemist, astronomer, geologist, phrenologist, spiritualist,"
1207,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"mathematician, historian, and lexicographer, are not poets; but they are"
1208,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the lawgivers of poets, and their construction underlies the structure of"
1209,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"every perfect poem. No matter what rises or is uttered, they send the seed"
1210,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,of the conception of it: of them and by them stand the visible proofs of
1211,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"souls. If there shall be love and content between the father and the son,"
1212,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,and if the greatness of the son is the exuding of the greatness of the
1213,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"father, there shall be love between the poet and the man of demonstrable"
1214,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,science. In the beauty of poems are the tuft and final applause of science.
1215,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1216,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"Great is the faith of the flush of knowledge, and of the investigation of"
1217,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the depths of qualities and things. Cleaving and circling here swells the
1218,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,soul of the poet: yet is president of itself always. The depths are
1219,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"fathomless, and therefore calm. The innocence and nakedness are resumed--"
1220,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,they are neither modest nor immodest. The whole theory of the special and
1221,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"supernatural, and all that was twined with it or educed out of it, departs"
1222,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"as a dream. What has ever happened, what happens, and whatever may or shall"
1223,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"happen, the vital laws enclose all: they are sufficient for any case and"
1224,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,for all cases--none to be hurried or retarded--any miracle of affairs or
1225,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"persons inadmissible in the vast clear scheme where every motion, and every"
1226,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"spear of grass, and the frames and spirits of men and women, and all that"
1227,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"concerns them, are unspeakably perfect miracles, all referring to all, and"
1228,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,each distinct and in its place. It is also not consistent with the reality
1229,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,of the soul to admit that there is anything in the known universe more
1230,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,divine than men and women.
1231,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1232,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"Men and women, and the earth and all upon it, are simply to be taken as"
1233,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"they are, and the investigation of their past and present and future shall"
1234,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"be unintermitted, and shall be done with perfect candour. Upon this basis"
1235,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"philosophy speculates, ever looking toward the poet, ever regarding the"
1236,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"eternal tendencies of all toward happiness, never inconsistent with what is"
1237,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,clear to the senses and to the soul. For the eternal tendencies of all
1238,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,toward happiness make the only point of sane philosophy. Whatever
1239,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,comprehends less than that--whatever is less than the laws of light and of
1240,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"astronomical motion--or less than the laws that follow the thief, the liar,"
1241,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the glutton, and the drunkard, through this life, and doubtless afterward--"
1242,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or less than vast stretches of time, or the slow formation of density, or"
1243,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the patient upheaving of strata--is of no account. Whatever would put God
1244,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,in a poem or system of philosophy as contending against some being or
1245,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,influence is also of no account. Sanity and ensemble characterise the great
1246,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"master:--spoilt in one principle, all is spoilt. The great master has"
1247,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,nothing to do with miracles. He sees health for himself in being one of the
1248,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,mass--he sees the hiatus in singular eminence. To the perfect shape comes
1249,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"common ground. To be under the general law is great, for that is to"
1250,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"correspond with it. The master knows that he is unspeakably great, and that"
1251,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"all are unspeakably great--that nothing, for instance, is greater than to"
1252,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"conceive children, and bring them up well--that to be is just as great as"
1253,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,to perceive or tell.
1254,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1255,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,In the make of the great masters the idea of political liberty is
1256,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,indispensable. Liberty takes the adherence of heroes wherever men and women
1257,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,exist; but never takes any adherence or welcome from the rest more than
1258,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,from poets. They are the voice and exposition of liberty. They out of ages
1259,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"are worthy the grand idea,--to them it is confided, and they must sustain"
1260,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"it. Nothing has precedence of it, and nothing can warp or degrade it. The"
1261,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,attitude of great poets is to cheer up slaves and horrify despots. The turn
1262,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"of their necks, the sound of their feet, the motions of their wrists, are"
1263,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"full of hazard to the one and hope to the other. Come nigh them a while,"
1264,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and, though they neither speak nor advise, you shall learn the faithful"
1265,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,American lesson. Liberty is poorly served by men whose good intent is
1266,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"quelled from one failure or two failures or any number of failures, or from"
1267,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the casual indifference or ingratitude of the people, or from the sharp"
1268,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"show of the tushes of power, or the bringing to bear soldiers and cannon or"
1269,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"any penal statutes. Liberty relies upon itself, invites no one, promises"
1270,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"nothing, sits in calmness and light, is positive and composed, and knows no"
1271,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,discouragement. The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent
1272,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"advance and retreat--the enemy triumphs--the prison, the handcuffs, the"
1273,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"iron necklace and anklet, the scaffold, garrote, and lead-balls, do their"
1274,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,work--the cause is asleep--the strong throats are choked with their own

1276,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"each other ... and is liberty gone out of that place? No, never. When"
1277,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"liberty goes, it is not the first to go, nor the second or third to go: it"
1278,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,waits for all the rest to go--it is the last. When the memories of the old
1279,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,martyrs are faded utterly away--when the large names of patriots are
1280,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,laughed at in the public halls from the lips of the orators--when the boys
1281,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"are no more christened after the same, but christened after tyrants and"
1282,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"traitors instead--when the laws of the free are grudgingly permitted, and"
1283,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,laws for informers and blood-money are sweet to the taste of the people--
1284,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"when I and you walk abroad upon the earth, stung with compassion at the"
1285,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"sight of numberless brothers answering our equal friendship, and calling no"
1286,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,man master--and when we are elated with noble joy at the sight of slaves--
1287,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"when the soul retires in the cool communion of the night, and surveys its"
1288,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"experience, and has much ecstasy over the word and deed that put back a"
1289,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,helpless innocent person into the gripe of the gripers or into any cruel
1290,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,inferiority--when those in all parts of these states who could easier
1291,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"realise the true American character, but do not yet[1]--when the swarms of"
1292,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"cringers, suckers, doughfaces, lice of politics, planners of sly"
1293,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,involutions for their own preferment to city offices or state legislatures
1294,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or the judiciary or Congress or the Presidency, obtain a response of love"
1295,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and natural deference from the people, whether they get the offices or no--"
1296,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,when it is better to be a bound booby and rogue in office at a high salary
1297,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"than the poorest free mechanic or farmer, with his hat unmoved from his"
1298,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"head, and firm eyes, and a candid and generous heart--and when servility by"
1299,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"town or state or the federal government, or any oppression on a large scale"
1300,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or small scale, can be tried on without its own punishment following duly"
1301,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"after in exact proportion, against the smallest chance of escape--or rather"
1302,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged from any
1303,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,part of the earth--then only shall the instinct of liberty be discharged
1304,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,from that part of the earth.

1308,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1309,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,As the attributes of the poets of the kosmos concentre in the real body and
1310,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"soul and in the pleasure of things, they possess the superiority of"
1311,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"genuineness over all fiction and romance. As they emit themselves, facts"
1312,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,are showered over with light--the daylight is lit with more volatile
1313,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,light--also the deep between the setting and rising sun goes deeper many-
1314,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,fold. Each precise object or condition or combination or process exhibits a
1315,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,beauty: the multiplication-table its--old age its--the carpenter's trade
1316,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,its--the grand opera its: the huge-hulled clean-shaped New York clipper at
1317,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,sea under steam or full sail gleams with unmatched beauty--the American
1318,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"circles and large harmonies of government gleam with theirs, and the"
1319,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,commonest definite intentions and actions with theirs. The poets of the
1320,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,kosmos advance through all interpositions and coverings and turmoils and
1321,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,stratagems to first principles. They are of use--they dissolve poverty from
1322,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"its need, and riches from its conceit. You large proprietor, they say,"
1323,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,shall not realise or perceive more than any one else. The owner of the
1324,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"library is not he who holds a legal title to it, having bought and paid for"
1325,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,it. Any one and every one is owner of the library who can read the same
1326,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"through all the varieties of tongues and subjects and styles, and in whom"
1327,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"they enter with ease, and take residence and force toward paternity and"
1328,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"maternity, and make supple and powerful and rich and large. These American"
1329,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"states, strong and healthy and accomplished, shall receive no pleasure from"
1330,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"violations of natural models, and must not permit them. In paintings or"
1331,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"mouldings or carvings in mineral or wood, or in the illustrations of books"
1332,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or newspapers, or in any comic or tragic prints, or in the patterns of"
1333,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"woven stuffs, or anything to beautify rooms or furniture or costumes, or to"
1334,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"put upon cornices or monuments or on the prows or sterns of ships, or to"
1335,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"put anywhere before the human eye indoors or out, that which distorts"
1336,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"honest shapes, or which creates unearthly beings or places or"
1337,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"contingencies, is a nuisance and revolt. Of the human form especially, it"
1338,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"is so great it must never be made ridiculous. Of ornaments to a work,"
1339,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,nothing _outré_ can be allowed; but those ornaments can be allowed that
1340,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"conform to the perfect facts of the open air, and that flow out of the"
1341,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"nature of the work, and come irrepressibly from it, and are necessary to"
1342,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the completion of the work. Most works are most beautiful without ornament.
1343,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,Exaggerations will be revenged in human physiology. Clean and vigorous
1344,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,children are conceived only in those communities where the models of
1345,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,natural forms are public every day. Great genius and the people of these
1346,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,states must never be demeaned to romances. As soon as histories are
1347,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"properly told, there is no more need of romances."
1348,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1349,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"The great poets are also to be known by the absence in them of tricks, and"
1350,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,by the justification of perfect personal candour. Then folks echo a new
1351,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,cheap joy and a divine voice leaping from their brains. How beautiful is
1352,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,candour! All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candour.
1353,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"Henceforth let no man of us lie, for we have seen that openness wins the"
1354,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"inner and outer world, and that there is no single exception, and that"
1355,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,never since our earth gathered itself in a mass has deceit or subterfuge or
1356,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,prevarication attracted its smallest particle or the faintest tinge of a
1357,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,shade--and that through the enveloping wealth and rank of a state or the
1358,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,whole republic of states a sneak or sly person shall be discovered and
1359,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,despised--and that the soul has never been once fooled and never can be
1360,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,fooled--and thrift without the loving nod of the soul is only a foetid
1361,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"puff--and there never grew up in any of the continents of the globe, nor"
1362,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"upon any planet or satellite or star, nor upon the asteroids, nor in any"
1363,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"part of ethereal space, nor in the midst of density, nor under the fluid"
1364,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"wet of the sea, nor in that condition which precedes the birth of babes,"
1365,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"nor at any time during the changes of life, nor in that condition that"
1366,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"follows what we term death, nor in any stretch of abeyance or action"
1367,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"afterward of vitality, nor in any process of formation or reformation"
1368,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"anywhere, a being whose instinct hated the truth."
1369,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1370,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"Extreme caution or prudence, the soundest organic health, large hope and"
1371,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"comparison and fondness for women and children, large alimentiveness and"
1372,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"destructiveness and causality, with a perfect sense of the oneness of"
1373,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"nature, and the propriety of the same spirit applied to human affairs--"
1374,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,these are called up of the float of the brain of the world to be parts of
1375,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the greatest poet from his birth. Caution seldom goes far enough. It has
1376,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,been thought that the prudent citizen was the citizen who applied himself
1377,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"to solid gains, and did well for himself and his family, and completed a"
1378,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,lawful life without debt or crime. The greatest poet sees and admits these
1379,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"economies as he sees the economies of food and sleep, but has higher"
1380,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,notions of prudence than to think he gives much when he gives a few slight
1381,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,attentions at the latch of the gate. The premises of the prudence of life
1382,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"are not the hospitality of it, or the ripeness and harvest of it. Beyond"
1383,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the independence of a little sum laid aside for burial-money, and of a few"
1384,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"clapboards around and shingles overhead on a lot of American soil owned,"
1385,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and the easy dollars that supply the year's plain clothing and meals, the"
1386,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,melancholy prudence of the abandonment of such a great being as a man is to
1387,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the toss and pallor of years of money-making, with all their scorching days"
1388,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and icy nights, and all their stifling deceits and underhanded dodgings, or"
1389,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"infinitesimals of parlours, or shameless stuffing while others starve,--and"
1390,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"all the loss of the bloom and odour of the earth, and of the flowers and"
1391,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"atmosphere, and of the sea, and of the true taste of the women and men you"
1392,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"pass or have to do with in youth or middle age, and the issuing sickness"
1393,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and desperate revolt at the close of a life without elevation or naïveté,"
1394,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and the ghastly chatter of a death without serenity or majesty,--is the"
1395,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,great fraud upon modern civilisation and forethought; blotching the surface
1396,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and system which civilisation undeniably drafts, and moistening with tears"
1397,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the immense features it spreads and spreads with such velocity before the
1398,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,reached kisses of the soul. Still the right explanation remains to be made
1399,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,about prudence. The prudence of the mere wealth and respectability of the
1400,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,most esteemed life appears too faint for the eye to observe at all when
1401,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,little and large alike drop quietly aside at the thought of the prudence
1402,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,suitable for immortality. What is wisdom that fills the thinness of a year
1403,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or seventy or eighty years, to wisdom spaced out by ages, and coming back"
1404,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,at a certain time with strong reinforcements and rich presents and the
1405,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,clear faces of wedding-guests as far as you can look in every direction
1406,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,running gaily toward you? Only the soul is of itself--all else has
1407,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,reference to what ensues. All that a person does or thinks is of
1408,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,consequence. Not a move can a man or woman make that affects him or her in
1409,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"a day or a month, or any part of the direct lifetime or the hour of death,"
1410,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,but the same affects him or her onward afterward through the indirect
1411,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,lifetime. The indirect is always as great and real as the direct. The
1412,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body. Not one
1413,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,name of word or deed--not of the putrid veins of gluttons or rum-drinkers--
1414,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,not peculation or cunning or betrayal or murder--no serpentine poison of
1415,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,those that seduce women--not the foolish yielding of women--not of the
1416,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,attainment of gain by discreditable means--not any nastiness of appetite--
1417,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"not any harshness of officers to men, or judges to prisoners, or fathers to"
1418,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"sons, or sons to fathers, or of husbands to wives, or bosses to their"
1419,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,boys--not of greedy looks or malignant wishes--nor any of the wiles
1420,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,practised by people upon themselves--ever is or ever can be stamped on the
1421,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"programme, but it is duly realised and returned, and that returned in"
1422,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"further performances, and they returned again. Nor can the push of charity"
1423,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or personal force ever be anything else than the profoundest reason,"
1424,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,whether it bring arguments to hand or no. No specification is necessary--to
1425,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"add or subtract or divide is in vain. Little or big, learned or unlearned,"
1426,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"white or black, legal or illegal, sick or well, from the first inspiration"
1427,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"down the windpipe to the last expiration out of it, all that a male or"
1428,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,female does that is vigorous and benevolent and clean is so much sure
1429,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,profit to him or her in the unshakable order of the universe and through
1430,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the whole scope of it for ever. If the savage or felon is wise, it is"
1431,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"well--if the greatest poet or savant is wise, it is simply the same--if the"
1432,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"President or chief justice is wise, it is the same--if the young mechanic"
1433,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or farmer is wise, it is no more or less. The interest will come round--all"
1434,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,will come round. All the best actions of war and peace--all help given to
1435,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"relatives and strangers, and the poor and old and sorrowful, and young"
1436,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"children and widows and the sick, and to all shunned persons--all"
1437,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,furtherance of fugitives and of the escape of slaves--all the self-denial
1438,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others take the seats of the"
1439,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"boats--all offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a"
1440,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,friend's sake or opinion's sake--all pains of enthusiasts scoffed at by
1441,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,their neighbours--all the vast sweet love and precious suffering of
1442,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,mothers--all honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded--all the
1443,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,grandeur and good of the few ancient nations whose fragments of annals we
1444,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,inherit--and all the good of the hundreds of far mightier and more ancient
1445,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,nations unknown to us by name or date or location--all that was ever
1446,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no--all that has at any time been"
1447,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"well suggested out of the divine heart of man, or by the divinity of his"
1448,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"mouth, or by the shaping of his great hands--and all that is well thought"
1449,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or done this day on any part of the surface of the globe, or on any of the"
1450,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,wandering stars or fixed stars by those there as we are here--or that is
1451,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"henceforth to be well thought or done by you, whoever you are, or by any"
1452,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"one--these singly and wholly inured at their time, and inured now, and will"
1453,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"inure always, to the identities from which they sprung or shall spring. Did"
1454,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,you guess any of them lived only its moment? The world does not so exist--
1455,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"no parts, palpable or impalpable, so exist--no result exists now without"
1456,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"being from its long antecedent result, and that from its antecedent, and so"
1457,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,backward without the farthest mentionable spot coining a bit nearer the
1458,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,beginning than any other spot.... Whatever satisfies the soul is truth. The
1459,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,prudence of the greatest poet answers at last the craving and glut of the
1460,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"soul, is not contemptuous of less ways of prudence if they conform to its"
1461,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"ways, puts off nothing, permits no let-up for its own case or any case, has"
1462,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"no particular Sabbath or judgment-day, divides not the living from the dead"
1463,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"or the righteous from the unrighteous, is satisfied with the present,"
1464,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"matches every thought or act by its correlative, knows no possible"
1465,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,forgiveness or deputed atonement--knows that the young man who composedly
1466,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"perilled his life and lost it has done exceeding well for himself, while"
1467,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the man who has not perilled his life, and retains it to old age in riches"
1468,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and ease, has perhaps achieved nothing for himself worth mentioning--and"
1469,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,that only that person has no great prudence to learn who has learnt to
1470,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"prefer long-lived things, and favours body and soul the same, and perceives"
1471,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the indirect assuredly following the direct, and what evil or good he does"
1472,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,leaping onward and waiting to meet him again--and who in his spirit in any
1473,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,emergency whatever neither hurries nor avoids death.
1474,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1475,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,The direct trial of him who would be the greatest poet is to-day. If he
1476,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,does not flood himself with the immediate age as with vast oceanic tides--
1477,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and if he does not attract his own land body and soul to himself, and hang"
1478,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,on its neck with incomparable love--and if he be not himself the age
1479,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,transfigured--and if to him is not opened the eternity which gives
1480,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,similitude to all periods and locations and processes and animate and
1481,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"inanimate forms, and which is the bond of time, and rises up from its"
1482,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"inconceivable vagueness and infiniteness in the swimming shape of to-day,"
1483,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and is held by the ductile anchors of life, and makes the present spot the"
1484,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"passage from what was to what shall be, and commits itself to the"
1485,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"representation of this wave of an hour, and this one of the sixty beautiful"
1486,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,children of the wave--let him merge in the general run and wait his
1487,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"development.... Still, the final test of poems or any character or work"
1488,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"remains. The prescient poet projects himself centuries ahead, and judges"
1489,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,performer or performance after the changes of time. Does it live through
1490,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"them? Does it still hold on untired? Will the same style, and the direction"
1491,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"of genius to similar points, be satisfactory now? Has no new discovery in"
1492,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"science, or arrival at superior planes of thought and judgment and"
1493,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"behaviour, fixed him or his so that either can be looked down upon? Have"
1494,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the marches of tens and hundreds and thousands of years made willing
1495,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,detours to the right hand and the left hand for his sake? Is he beloved
1496,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,long and long after he is buried? Does the young man think often of him?
1497,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,and the young woman think often of him? and do the middle-aged and the old
1498,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,think of him?
1499,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1500,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"A great poem is for ages and ages, in common, and for all degrees and"
1501,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"complexions, and all departments and sects, and for a woman as much as a"
1502,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"man, and a man as much as a woman. A great poem is no finish to a man or"
1503,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"woman, but rather a beginning. Has any one fancied he could sit at last"
1504,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"under some due authority, and rest satisfied with explanations, and realise"
1505,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,and be content and full? To no such terminus does the greatest poet bring--
1506,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,he brings neither cessation nor sheltered fatness and ease. The touch of
1507,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,him tells in action. Whom he takes he takes with firm sure grasp into live
1508,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,regions previously unattained. Thenceforward is no rest: they see the space
1509,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,and ineffable sheen that turn the old spots and lights into dead vacuums.
1510,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"The companion of him beholds the birth and progress of stars, and learns"
1511,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,one of the meanings. Now there shall be a man cohered out of tumult and
1512,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"chaos. The elder encourages the younger, and shows him how: they two shall"
1513,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"launch off fearlessly together till the new world fits an orbit for itself,"
1514,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"and looks unabashed on the lesser orbits of the stars, and sweeps through"
1515,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the ceaseless rings, and shall never be quiet again."
1516,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1517,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,There will soon be no more priests. Their work is done. They may wait a
1518,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"while--perhaps a generation or two,--dropping off by degrees. A superior"
1519,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,breed shall take their place--the gangs of kosmos and prophets _en masse_
1520,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,shall take their place. A new order shall arise; and they shall be the
1521,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"priests of man, and every man shall be his own priest. The churches built"
1522,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,under their umbrage shall be the churches of men and women. Through the
1523,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,divinity of themselves shall the kosmos and the new breed of poets be
1524,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,interpreters of men and women and of all events and things. They shall find
1525,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"their inspiration in real objects to-day, symptoms of the past and future."
1526,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"They shall not deign to defend immortality, or God, or the perfection of"
1527,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"things, or liberty, or the exquisite beauty and reality of the soul. They"
1528,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"shall arise in America, and be responded to from the remainder of the"
1529,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,earth.
1530,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1531,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,The English language befriends the grand American expression--it is brawny
1532,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"enough, and limber and full enough. On the tough stock of a race who,"
1533,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"through all change of circumstance, was never without the idea of political"
1534,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"liberty, which is the animus of all liberty, it has attracted the terms of"
1535,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,daintier and gayer and subtler and more elegant tongues. It is the powerful
1536,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,language of resistance--it is the dialect of common sense. It is the speech
1537,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"of the proud and melancholy races, and of all who aspire. It is the chosen"
1538,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"tongue to express growth, faith, self-esteem, freedom, justice, equality,"
1539,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"friendliness, amplitude, prudence, decision, and courage. It is the medium"
1540,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,that shall well nigh express the inexpressible.

1542,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"No great literature, nor any like style of behaviour or oratory or social"

1549,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,throbs a live interrogation in every freeman's and freewoman's heart after
1550,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"that which passes by, or this built to remain. Is it uniform with my"
1551,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,country? Are its disposals without ignominious distinctions? Is it for the
1552,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"ever-growing communes of brothers and lovers, large, well united, proud"
1553,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"beyond the old models, generous beyond all models? Is it something grown"
1554,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"fresh out of the fields, or drawn from the sea, for use to me, to-day,"
1555,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"here? I know that what answers for me, an American, must answer for any"
1556,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,individual or nation that serves for a part of my materials. Does this
1557,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,answer? or is it without reference to universal needs? or sprung of the
1558,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,needs of the less developed society of special ranks? or old needs of
1559,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,pleasure overlaid by modern science and forms? Does this acknowledge
1560,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"liberty with audible and absolute acknowledgment, and set slavery at"
1561,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"nought, for life and death? Will it help breed one good-shaped man, and a"
1562,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,woman to be his perfect and independent mate? Does it improve manners? Is
1563,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,it for the nursing of the young of the republic? Does it solve readily with
1564,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,the sweet milk of the breasts of the mother of many children? Has it too
1565,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the old, ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality? Does it look with the"
1566,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"same love on the last-born and on those hardening toward stature, and on"
1567,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the errant, and on those who disdain all strength of assault outside of"
1568,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,their own?
1569,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,
1570,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,The poems distilled from other poems will probably pass away. The coward
1571,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,will surely pass away. The expectation of the vital and great can only be
1572,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,satisfied by the demeanour of the vital and great. The swarms of the
1573,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"polished, deprecating, and reflectors, and the polite, float off and leave"
1574,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,no remembrance. America prepares with composure and goodwill for the
1575,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,visitors that have sent word. It is not intellect that is to be their
1576,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"warrant and welcome. The talented, the artist, the ingenious, the editor,"
1577,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"the statesman, the erudite--they are not unappreciated--they fall in their"
1578,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,place and do their work. The soul of the nation also does its work. No
1579,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"disguise can pass on it--no disguise can conceal from it. It rejects none,"
1580,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,it permits all. Only toward as good as itself and toward the like of itself
1581,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,will it advance half-way. An individual is as superb as a nation when he
1582,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,has the qualities which make a superb nation. The soul of the largest and
1583,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,wealthiest and proudest nation may well go half-way to meet that of its
1584,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,poets. The signs are effectual. There is no fear of mistake. If the one is
1585,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,"true, the other is true. The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs"
1586,PREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.,him as affectionately as he has absorbed it.

2835,_SONG OF THE BROAD-AXE._,"And the future is no more uncertain than the present,"

2839,_SONG OF THE BROAD-AXE._,
2840,_SONG OF THE BROAD-AXE._,What do you think endures?

9375,POSTSCRIPT.,"While this Selection was passing through the press, it has been my"
9376,POSTSCRIPT.,"privilege to receive two letters from Mr. Whitman, besides another"
9377,POSTSCRIPT.,communicated to me through a friend. I find my experience to be the same as
9378,POSTSCRIPT.,"that of some previous writers: that, if one admires Whitman in reading his"
9379,POSTSCRIPT.,"books, one loves him on coming into any personal relation with him--even"
9380,POSTSCRIPT.,the comparatively distant relation of letter-writing.
9381,POSTSCRIPT.,
9382,POSTSCRIPT.,The more I have to thank the poet for the substance and tone of his
9383,POSTSCRIPT.,"letters, and some particular expressions in them, the more does it become"
9384,POSTSCRIPT.,incumbent upon me to guard against any misapprehension. He has had nothing
9385,POSTSCRIPT.,"whatever to do with this Selection, as to either prompting, guiding, or"
9386,POSTSCRIPT.,even ratifying it: except only that he did not prohibit my making two or
9387,POSTSCRIPT.,"three verbal omissions in the _Prose Preface to the Leaves of Grass_, and"
9388,POSTSCRIPT.,"he has supplied his own title, _President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn_, to a"
9389,POSTSCRIPT.,"poem which, in my Prefatory Notice, is named (by myself) _Nocturn for the"
9390,POSTSCRIPT.,Death of Lincoln_. All admirers of his poetry will rejoice to learn that
9391,POSTSCRIPT.,"there is no longer any doubt of his adding to his next edition ""a brief"
9392,POSTSCRIPT.,cluster of pieces born of thoughts on the deep themes of Death and
9393,POSTSCRIPT.,"Immortality."" A new American edition will be dear to many: a complete"
9394,POSTSCRIPT.,"English edition ought to be an early demand of English poetic readers, and"
9395,POSTSCRIPT.,would be the right and crowning result of the present Selection.
