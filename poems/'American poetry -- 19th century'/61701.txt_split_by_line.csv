89,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
90,TABLE OF CONTENTS,During the years 1934 and 1935 I made a close study of O. Henry's
91,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Texas contacts. The newspapers of Texas during the time of O. Henry's
92,TABLE OF CONTENTS,residence in the state furnished one of the sources which I
93,TABLE OF CONTENTS,investigated; and it was during my research in the files of the
94,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"_Houston Post_, 1895-1896, that I discovered the stories and"
95,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"illustrations which make up this book. In reprinting this material, I"
96,TABLE OF CONTENTS,have followed the original version meticulously except for the
97,TABLE OF CONTENTS,correction of obvious typographical errors and certain slight
98,TABLE OF CONTENTS,aberrations in punctuation that seemed to demand revision for the sake
99,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"of consistency or to comply with modern standards of usage. Even so, I"
100,TABLE OF CONTENTS,have allowed many typographical and even grammatical conventions to
101,TABLE OF CONTENTS,remain as they were printed forty years ago.
102,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
103,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"The companion volume to O. Henry Encore, namely, O. Henry in Texas,"
104,TABLE OF CONTENTS,embodies the results of my investigation into the Texas period of O.
105,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Henry's life, and contains a much more complete account of his work on"
106,TABLE OF CONTENTS,the _Houston Post_ than I have been able to give in the short
107,TABLE OF CONTENTS,introduction to the present volume.
108,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
109,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Permission for reprinting the material here was arranged for me by
110,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"former Governor W. P. Hobby of Texas, now President of the Houston"
111,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Post, and Mr. A. E. Clarkson, Business Manager of the Post. I am happy"
112,TABLE OF CONTENTS,to express my gratitude to them. My thanks are due also to Dr.
113,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Leonidas Warren Payne, Jr., of The University of Texas, Dr. Vernon"
114,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Loggins, of Columbia University, and the late Dr. Dorothy Scarborough,"
115,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"of Columbia University, for helping in the identification of the"
116,TABLE OF CONTENTS,material. Mary Sunlocks Harrell

119,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
120,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Introduction
121,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
122,TABLE OF CONTENTS,O. Henry's real name was William Sidney (Sydney) Porter. He was born
123,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"in Greensboro, North Carolina, 1862, of mixed Quaker (Connecticut) and"
124,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Southern (Virginia) ancestry. His mother, a woman of remarkable"
125,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"strength of character and some literary talent, died in 1865, and O."
126,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Henry's rearing was entrusted to his paternal grandmother. His father
127,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"was a physician, but apparently a business failure at everything he"
128,TABLE OF CONTENTS,attempted. What schooling O. Henry had was received in the little
129,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"private school of an aunt, Miss Lina Porter. From early boyhood he"
130,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"worked in the drug store of an uncle, and long before he was twenty he"
131,TABLE OF CONTENTS,was a registered pharmacist.
132,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
133,TABLE OF CONTENTS,In 1882 O. Henry left for Texas to seek a dryer climate. It was feared
134,TABLE OF CONTENTS,that he was developing consumption. He settled on the Hall ranch in La
135,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Salle County, almost half way between San Antonio and the Mexican"
136,TABLE OF CONTENTS,border. He spent two years on the ranch and in 1884 went to Austin.
137,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"During his first three years there, he lived as practically an adopted"
138,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"son in the home of Mr. Joe Harrell, who was also a native of"
139,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Greensboro. He worked at various ""jobs""--cigar-store clerk,"
140,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"pharmacist, etc."
141,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
142,TABLE OF CONTENTS,In 1887 O. Henry secured a position in the State Land Office as
143,TABLE OF CONTENTS,assistant compiling draftsman. Here he remained for four years--the
144,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"happiest ones, it seems, in his life. The position meant to him"
145,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"prosperity; and five months after he had begun his work, he was"
146,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"married to Miss Athol Estes, the daughter of Mrs. G. P. Roach. There"
147,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"was a romantic elopement, a family reconciliation, and what O. Henry"
148,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"called ""a settling down to a comedy of happiness ever afterwards."""
149,TABLE OF CONTENTS,It was shortly after he took up his work in the Land Office that O.
150,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Henry first marketed his writings. The amount received for a ""string"
151,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"of jokes and sketches"" accepted by the Detroit Free Press was small,"
152,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"but it was to increase steadily, even during the most troublous period"
153,TABLE OF CONTENTS,of his life. As a boy in Greensboro he was known for his drawings and
154,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"cartoons, and while on the ranch in Texas he drew some pictures and"
155,TABLE OF CONTENTS,also wrote to his relatives and friends in North Carolina letters
156,TABLE OF CONTENTS,indicative of his later literary style.
157,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
158,TABLE OF CONTENTS,A change in the State administration in 1891 meant that O. Henry's
159,TABLE OF CONTENTS,position in the Land Office was lost. He became connected with the
160,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"First National Bank of Austin as paying and receiving teller, where he"
161,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"was to work until December, 1894. Before giving up his position in the"
162,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"bank, he had undertaken the publication of a humorous, semi-political"
163,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"weekly, The Rolling Stone, published at Austin and later"
164,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"simultaneously in Austin and San Antonio. After he left the bank, he"
165,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"had to depend on The Rolling Stone for all his income, but without"
166,TABLE OF CONTENTS,capital he could not make of it a financial success. It existed only a
167,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"year, from April 28, 1894, to April 27, 1895. Almost six months passed"
168,TABLE OF CONTENTS,before O. Henry left Austin to become a staff contributor to the
169,TABLE OF CONTENTS,_Houston Daily Post_. His first work appeared in the Post on October
170,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"19, 1895."
171,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
172,TABLE OF CONTENTS,It was shortly after this date that an ominous shadow settled over O.
173,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Henry's head. In February of 1896 the Federal Grand Jury at Austin
174,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"brought an indictment against W. S. Porter, charging the embezzlement"
175,TABLE OF CONTENTS,of funds while he was acting as paying and receiving teller of the
176,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"First National Bank of Austin. Finally, summoned to trial in July,"
177,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"1896, O. Henry left Houston to answer the charge; but he only got as"
178,TABLE OF CONTENTS,far as Hempstead. There it was necessary to change trains; but instead
179,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"of taking the train for Austin, he returned to Houston and then went"
180,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"on to New Orleans. When next heard from, he was in Honduras. In"
181,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"January, 1897, after six month's absence O. Henry received news of the"
182,TABLE OF CONTENTS,serious illness of his wife. He set out to join her immediately and
183,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"reached Austin by February 5, 1897. He at once reported to the civil"
184,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"authorities. His bondsmen had not been assessed, and he was allowed to"
185,TABLE OF CONTENTS,go free but with his bond doubled.
186,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
187,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"His wife died of tuberculosis the following July, and in February,"
188,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"1898, O. Henry' case came to trial. He plead not guilty, but for some"
189,TABLE OF CONTENTS,unknown reason he maintained an utter indifference throughout the
190,TABLE OF CONTENTS,trial. On March 25 he was sentenced to imprisonment in the Federal
191,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Ward of the Ohio State Penitentiary. On account of good behavior,"
192,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"however, O. Henry's term in prison was shortened to a little over"
193,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"three years. On July 24, 1901, he again became a free man. His ability"
194,TABLE OF CONTENTS,as a pharmacist gave him the opportunity to work in prison at
195,TABLE OF CONTENTS,something comparatively easy. But what is of most interest to us in
196,TABLE OF CONTENTS,regard to his life there is that by the time he got out of confinement
197,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"he was pretty well known, under the pseudonym of O. Henry by editors"
198,TABLE OF CONTENTS,of a number of America's most popular magazines.
199,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
200,TABLE OF CONTENTS,As soon as he was out of prison O. Henry went to join his daughter and
201,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"the Roaches, who were then living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He now"
202,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"devoted all his energies to writing, and in the spring of 1902 he was"
203,TABLE OF CONTENTS,called to New York. The eight years that O. Henry spent in the great
204,TABLE OF CONTENTS,metropolis were marked by an astonishing fecundity in literary
205,TABLE OF CONTENTS,production and an ever increasing fame as the writer of a peculiar
206,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"type of short story, now known universally as the ""O. Henry short"
207,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"story."""
208,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
209,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"O. Henry died in New York City on June 5,"
210,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"1910, and was buried in Asheville, North Carolina. The only other"
211,TABLE OF CONTENTS,event of his life which should be recorded here is his marriage in
212,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"1907 to Miss Sara Coleman, a sweetheart of his North Carolina days,"
213,TABLE OF CONTENTS,and author of Wind of Destiny in which appear many letters written to
214,TABLE OF CONTENTS,her by O. Henry just before their marriage.
215,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
216,II,II
217,II,
218,II,Practically the whole body of O. Henry's stories and sketches first
219,II,"appeared in periodicals. Doubleday, Page & Company (now Doubleday,"
220,II,"Doran and Company) have put into book form almost everything he wrote,"
221,II,and the volumes in the order of their publication are as follows:
222,II,"_Cabbages and Kings_, 1904; _The Four Million_, 1906; The Trimmed Lamp"
223,II,"and _Heart of the West_, 1907; _The Voice of the City_ and _The Gentle"
224,II,"Grafter_, 1908; _Roads of Destiny_ and _Options_, 1909; _Strictly"
225,II,"Business_ and _Whirligigs_, 1910; _Sixes and Sevens_, 1911; Rolling"
226,II,"Stones, 1913; _Waifs and Strays_, 1917. In 1923 Harper and Brothers"
227,II,"brought out _Postscripts_ by O. Henry, edited by Florence Stratton."
228,II,
229,II,"The title of _Rolling Stones_, invented by Harry Peyton Steger, is"
230,II,"based on the weekly, _The Rolling Stone_, published by O. Henry in"
231,II,Texas in 1894 and 1895. It contains odds and ends; some stories
232,II,"written when O. Henry was at his best, ""The Fog in Santone,"" for"
233,II,example; material used in the original The Rolling Stone; excerpts
234,II,from the Postscripts column written for the _Houston Post_; and a few
235,II,"letters. _Postscripts_ by O. Henry, as the name suggests, contains"
236,II,material taken from Will Porter's _Houston Post_ column. _The Four
237,II,"Million_ is based on New York life, and _The Trimmed Lamp_, _The Voice"
238,II,"of the City_, and _Strictly Business_ are simply ""more stories of the"
239,II,"four million."" _Heart of the West_ is made up exclusively of western"
240,II,"stories. _Cabbages and Kings_, a composite of several individual"
241,II,"stories separately published and now woven together, depicts life as"
242,II,"O. Henry saw it in Honduras, Central America. _The Gentle Grafter_ is"
243,II,supposedly based upon stories which O. Henry heard his fellow
244,II,prisoners relate in the Ohio Penitentiary. The other volumes are made
245,II,"up of stories varied in character--New York, Texas, and tropical"
246,II,America.
247,II,
248,II,"Just as every other great artist has done, O. Henry has set an"
249,II,"example. He invented a short-story technique of his own, and the most"
250,II,discriminating critics have studied that technique and pronounced it
251,II,"good. He owed no more to the ""unity of impression idea"" of Poe than to"
252,II,the stringy structure of the medieval Patient Griselda. Almost by
253,II,"chance, it seems, he hit upon the trick of concentration of attention,"
254,II,"economy of words, rising suspense, and denouement of climax and"
255,II,surprise; and in that trick lies his art.
256,II,
257,II,"There was in O. Henry, however, a power greater than his art. That was"
258,II,his genius for observation. Art without ideas profits nothing. O.
259,II,"Henry got his ideas by seeing everything about him, by always keeping"
260,II,"on the qui vive, as he himself said, for ""the man around the corner."""
261,II,"Fate dealt him a life of manifold experiences, and from every"
262,II,"experience his store of observations increased. After all, his works"
263,II,are no more than an artistic record of life as he saw it.
264,II,
265,III,III
266,III,
267,III,The stories that make up the present volume have for forty years
268,III,remained unnoticed in the files of the _Houston Post_. The general
269,III,belief that O. Henry was simply a columnist on the Post is probably
270,III,the reason for their being overlooked. The idea that his column
271,III,"appeared regularly has, furthermore, tended to dismiss the question of"
272,III,what sort of work he really did on the paper. When I examined the
273,III,"files of the Post, I was surprised to find that the column ""Some"
274,III,"Postscripts"" was often missing. In February, 1896, it came out only"
275,III,"four times, in April seven, in June three. In spite of this"
276,III,irregularity Will Porter's salary had gradually been raised from $15
277,III,to $25 a week.
278,III,
279,III,Here is a situation which has only one logical explanation. O. Henry
280,III,must have done other work in order to draw this steadily increasing
281,III,weekly salary. A close examination of the Houston Post files from
282,III,"October 19, 1895, to June 22, 1896, reveals a mass of material,"
283,III,"heretofore unidentified, as unmistakably the work of Will Porter."
284,III,
285,III,What first attracts the eye is the abundance of unsigned comic
286,III,drawings and clever cartoons. The style of these drawings is
287,III,unquestionably O. Henry's. We know from various sources that he was
288,III,"constantly drawing pictures, and we have a positive statement from"
289,III,"Colonel R. M. Johnston, under whom Will Porter worked on the Houston"
290,III,"Post, that his ability to draw cartoons was called into requisition"
291,III,soon after he joined the staff of the Post. Some of the best of these
292,III,cartoons depict the political situation of the time. Others are
293,III,entirely independent of politics and point to the development of the
294,III,present-day comic strips in all newspapers. Sometimes they portray
295,III,character traits and are accompanied by rhymed quips. At other times
296,III,"they are used to illustrate lengthy stories. These stories, of course,"
297,III,"were composed by Will Porter, and from them the selections for this"
298,III,volume have been made.
299,III,
300,III,"The word-usage, sentence-structure, mythological allusion,"
301,III,"plot-manipulation, character types, and central ideas that"
302,III,"characterize O. Henry's short stories generally, are also plainly"
303,III,"recognizable in these selections from the _Houston Post_. For example,"
304,III,"""A Tragedy"" not only turns on a pun, as O. Henry's stories often do,"
305,III,"but is based upon the story of The Arabian Nights, which later colored"
306,III,"O. Henry's whole conception of New York City, Little-Old-Bagdad-on-"
307,III,"the-Subway. The central idea of ""An Odd Character,"" the story of a"
308,III,"tramp who claims to be 241 years old, appeared later in ""The Enchanted"
309,III,"Kiss"" and ""Door of Unrest."""
310,III,
311,III,"The characters of these earlier stories--shop-girls, Irish policemen,"
312,III,"crooks, tramps, sheep-men, cowmen, drunkards, pharmacists, doctors,"
313,III,"newspaper reporters, dudes--are practically identical with many of"
314,III,"those used in later O. Henry stories. Likewise, O. Henry's propensity"
315,III,"for the use of the ""envelope structure,"" the sort provided by the"
316,III,"pilgrimage in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and ""narrated development,"""
317,III,"or the telling of the story by one of the characters, is very much in"
318,III,"evidence in these _Houston Post_ stories, as in a number of his later"
319,III,"acknowledged works. For example, in ""The Mirage on the Frio"" a"
320,III,sheep-man from La Salle County tells his story to a group of men on a
321,III,Buffalo Bayou fishing party; and later in Cabbages and Kings the story
322,III,"of ""The Shamrock and the Palm"" is told by the Irishman Clancy to a"
323,III,group of fellow Caucasians who have met at the end of a tropical day.
324,III,"A large amount of internal evidence, moreover, points emphatically to"
325,III,O. Henry as the author of these pieces. They have the unmistakable
326,III,"stylistic qualities, the humorous point of view, the unexpected"
327,III,"climaxes of O. Henry, After a careful and detailed study of every"
328,III,"single piece of the material here reproduced, along with the"
329,III,"application of various stylistic tests, I was thoroughly convinced of"
330,III,the authenticity of its authorship. In order to support my own
331,III,"convictions, however, I consulted experts who have been students of O."
332,III,"Henry for years. Dr. L. W. Payne, Jr., of The University of Texas, Dr."
333,III,"Vernon Loggins, of Columbia University, and Dr. Dorothy Scarborough,"
334,III,"also of Columbia and compiler of many books of short stories, examined"
335,III,photostatic copies which I had made of the material. They are
336,III,unanimous in the opinion that the authorship of both the drawings with
337,III,their legends and the articles and stories may be safely attributed to
338,III,O. Henry's pen.
339,III,
340,III,The nature of the material included in this volume determined the
341,III,arrangement of the book into three parts. The stories in the first
342,III,part show that Will Porter had already discovered the technique that
343,III,made him famous as O. Henry. The sketches in the second part show O.
344,III,Henry at work-gathering story material from his observations of life.
345,III,"Will Porter's ventures into the realm of newspaper poetry, I have"
346,III,included in order to illustrate the principles set forth in his
347,III,"article ""Newspaper Poets,"" also reprinted here. As far as I know, this"
348,III,article is the only bit of serious literary criticism ever written by
349,III,O. Henry. It is noteworthy also as the only article in the _Houston
350,III,"Post_ which was ever signed in full by ""W. S. Porter."" A more detailed"
351,III,treatment of this and allied topics concerning O. Henry's life in
352,III,"Texas may be found in my O. Henry in Texas, designed as a companion"
353,III,volume to the present book.

357,III,Part One: Stories
358,III,
359,III,A Night Errant
360,III,
361,III,One of the greatest of books is the daily life around us. All that the
362,III,"human mind can conceive; all that the human heart can feel, and the"
363,III,lips tell are encompassed in the little world about us. He that
364,III,beholds with understanding eyes can see beneath the thin veil of the
365,III,"commonplace, the romance, the tragedy and the broad comedy that is"
366,III,being played upon the world's stage by the actors great and little who
367,III,tread the boards of the Theater of the Universe.
368,III,
369,III,Life is neither tragedy nor comedy. It is a mingling of both. High
370,III,above us omnipotent hands pull the strings that choke our laughter
371,III,with sobs and cause strange sounds of mirth to break in upon our
372,III,"deepest grief. We are marionettes that dance and cry, scarce at our"
373,III,"own wills; and at the end, the flaring lights are out, we are laid to"
374,III,"rest in our wooden boxes, and down comes the dark night to cover the"
375,III,scene of our brief triumph.
376,III,
377,III,We elbow heroes on the streets as grand as any the poets have sung; in
378,III,the faces of obscure women and prosy men a student of his kind can see
379,III,"the imprints of all the passions, both good and bad, that have"
380,III,illuminated the pages of song and story.
381,III,
382,III,"There is good in all, and we are none all good. The scholar in his"
383,III,"library, the woodcutter in the forest, my lady in her boudoir and the"
384,III,"painted, hard-eyed denizen of the byways--we are all from the same"
385,III,clay.
386,III,
387,III,"And the hands of fate pull the strings, and we caper and pirouette;"
388,III,and some go up and some go down and haphazard chance or else an
389,III,"obscure divinity pulls us this way and that, and where are we left?"
390,III,Blind and chattering on the brink of an eternal unknowableness. We
391,III,spring from a common root. The king and the bricklayer are equal
392,III,except as to environs; the queen and the milkmaid may sit side by side
393,III,with pail and crown on the ragged edge of destiny; the human heart is
394,III,the same the world over; and when the judge sits upon the doings of
395,III,"his puppets, who will prevail?"
396,III,
397,III,The Post Man has an overcoat with a high collar. This is convenient in
398,III,more ways than one. He turns it up when passing beggars upon the
399,III,"street corners, and thus shuts out their importunities and saves his"
400,III,conscience; he pulls it around his ears with dignified stateliness
401,III,when meeting gentlemen who deal in goods which he hath bought anon;
402,III,"and lastly, it is useful when the weather is cold."
403,III,
404,III,Sometimes when the purple shades begin to fall on Saturday evening and
405,III,the cool mists creep up from the sluggish waters of the bayou the Post
406,III,Man dons his useful article of apparel and hieth him forth among the
407,III,hedges and the highways. He sees the seamy side through the gilding
408,III,"that covers the elect of the earth, and he sees the pure gold that"
409,III,glitters amid the mire where tread the lowly and meek of heart. He
410,III,catches the note of discord in the prayer of the Pharisee on the
411,III,"street corner, and the jangle of the untuned bells that hang above"
412,III,many houses of worship. He sees strange deeds of nobility and lofty
413,III,self-denial among people from whose touch respectability draws aside
414,III,"its skirts, and the mark of the beast upon the brow of the high and"
415,III,saintly.
416,III,
417,III,A little here and there he jots down upon his pad; the greater part of
418,III,the panorama goes by unrecorded until something comes in the vast To
419,III,Be that will either explain--or end.

422,III,
423,III,Robert Burns has drawn a perfect picture of the purest peace and
424,III,"happiness in his ""Cotter's Saturday Night."" The laborer comes home"
425,III,from his work and is met by his joyful family. The fire burns
426,III,"brightly, the lamp is lit, and they draw the curtains and sit about"
427,III,"their humble board, shutting in their little happy world from the cold"
428,III,and bleak night.
429,III,
430,III,"There are such homes now and always will be, but if one will traverse"
431,III,the streets of a city on Saturday night he will witness many scenes of
432,III,a far different nature.
433,III,
434,III,As the homeward bound columns file along the sidewalks there is much
435,III,to be seen that presages sorrow and scant comfort to the waiting ones
436,III,"at their homes. There are staggering steps, loud speeches with rude"
437,III,"and thickened tongues, and plentiful signs of misspent wages and the"
438,III,indulgence of debased appetites.
439,III,
440,III,The saloons are reaping a rich harvest that should belong to wives and
441,III,"children. Some fling away in an hour what has taken them days to earn,"
442,III,and will carry home nothing but sullen looks and empty pockets. You
443,III,"can see all along the streets pale, anxious-looking women slipping"
444,III,through the crowd in the hope of meeting the providers and protectors
445,III,"of their homes, and inducing them to come there instead of lingering"
446,III,with their besotted comrades. What should be a season of rest and
447,III,"repose beneath the home vine and fig tree is turned into Saturnalia,"
448,III,and a loosing of bad passions.
449,III,
450,III,"Homeward flit the trim shop girls, the week's work over, intent on the"
451,III,rest and pleasure of the morrow; threading their straightforward and
452,III,dextrous way through the throng. Homeward plods the weary housekeeper
453,III,with her basket of vegetables for Sunday's dinner. Homeward goes the
454,III,solid citizen laden with bundles and bags. Homeward slip weary working
455,III,"women, hurrying to fill the hungry mouths awaiting them."
456,III,"Respectability moves homeward, but as the everlasting stars creep out"
457,III,"above, queer and warped things steal forth like imps of the night to"
458,III,"hide, and sulk, and carouse, and prey upon whatever the darkness"
459,III,bringeth to them.
460,III,
461,III,"Down on the bank of the bayou, beyond the car shops, the foundries,"
462,III,the lumbermills and the great manufactories that go to make Houston
463,III,"the wonderful business and trade center she is, stands--or rather,"
464,III,"leans--a little shanty. It is made of clapboards, old planks, pieces"
465,III,of tin and odds and ends of lumber picked up here and there. It is
466,III,built close to the edge of the foul and sluggish bayou. Back of it
467,III,"rises the bank full ten feet high; below it, only a few feet, ripples"
468,III,the sullen tide.
469,III,
470,III,In this squalid hut lives Crip. Crip is nine years old. He is
471,III,"freckled-faced, thin and subdued. From his knee his left leg is gone"
472,III,"and in its place is a clumsy wooden stump, on which he limps around at"
473,III,quite a wonderful pace. Crip's mother cleans up three or four offices
474,III,"on Main Street and takes in washing at other times. Somehow, they"
475,III,manage to live in this tottering habitation patched up by Crip's
476,III,"father, who several years before had fallen into the bayou one night"
477,III,"while drunk, and what was left of him by the catfish was buried upon"
478,III,"the bank a hundred yards farther down. Of late, Crip had undertaken to"
479,III,assist in the mutual support.
480,III,
481,III,One morning he came stumping timidly into the office of the Post and
482,III,purchased a few papers. These he offered for sale upon the streets
483,III,with great diffidence. Crip had no difficulty in selling his papers.
484,III,"People stopped and bought readily the wares of this shrinking,"
485,III,weak-voiced youngster. His wooden leg caught the eye of hurrying
486,III,passersby and the nickels rained into his hand as long as he had any
487,III,papers left.
488,III,
489,III,One morning Crip failed to call for his papers. The next day he did
490,III,"not appear, nor the next, and one of the newsboys was duly questioned"
491,III,as to his absence.
492,III,
493,III,"""Crip's got de pewmonia,"" he said."
494,III,
495,III,"The Post Man, albeit weighed down by numerous tribulations of others"
496,III,"and his own, when night comes puts on his overcoat and wends his way"
497,III,down the bayou toward the home of Crip.
498,III,
499,III,"The air is chilly and full of mist, and great puddles left by the"
500,III,recent rains glimmer and sparkle in the electric lights. No wonder
501,III,"that pneumonia has laid its cold hand upon the frail and weakly Crip,"
502,III,living as he does in the rain-soaked shanty down on the water's edge.
503,III,The Post Man goes to inquire if he has had a doctor and if he is
504,III,supplied with the necessities his condition must require. He walks
505,III,down the railroad tracks and comes close upon two figures marching
506,III,with uncertain stateliness in the same direction.
507,III,
508,III,"One of them speaks loudly, with oratorical flourish, but with an"
509,III,exaggerated carefulness that proclaims he is in a certain stage of
510,III,intoxication. His voice is well known in the drawing-rooms and the
511,III,"highest social circles of Houston. His name is--well, let us call him"
512,III,"Old Boy, for so do his admiring companions denominate him. There comes"
513,III,hurrying past them the form of a somberly-clad woman.
514,III,
515,III,Intuitively the Post Man thinks she is of the house of Crip and
516,III,accosts her with interrogatories. He gleans from her gasping brogue
517,III,"that a doctor has seen Crip and that he is very sick, but with proper"
518,III,"medicines, nursing and food he will probably recover. She is now"
519,III,"hastening to the drug store to buy--with her last dollar, she"
520,III,says--the medicine he must take at once.
521,III,
522,III,"""I will stay with him until you return,"" says the Post Man, and with a"
523,III,"fervent ""Hiven bless you, sorr!"" she melts away toward the lights of"
524,III,the city.
525,III,
526,III,The house where Crip lives is on a kind of shelf on the bayou side and
527,III,its approach from above must be made down a set of steep and roughly
528,III,hewn steps cut into the bank by the deceased architect of the house.
529,III,At the top of these stairs the two society lights stop.
530,III,
531,III,"""Old Boy,"" says one of them, ""give it up. It might be catching. And"
532,III,you are going to the dance tonight. This little rat of a newsboy--why
533,III,"should you see him personally? Come, let's go back. You've had so"
534,III,"much--"""
535,III,
536,III,"""Bobby,"" says the Old Boy, ""have I labored all these years in vain,"
537,III,trying to convince you that you are an ass? I know I'm a devil of a
538,III,"buzzerfly, and glash of fashion, but I've gozzer see zat boy. Sold me"
539,III,"papers a week, 'n now zey tell me he's sick in this ratsh hole down"
540,III,"here. Come on, Bobby, or else go't devil. I'm going in."""
541,III,
542,III,Old Boy pushes his silk hat to the back of his head and starts with
543,III,dangerous rapidity down the steep stairs.
544,III,
545,III,"His friend, seeing that he is determined, takes his arm and they both"
546,III,sway and stagger down to the little shelf of land below.
547,III,
548,III,"The Post Man follows them silently, and they are too much occupied"
549,III,with their own unsteady progress to note his presence. He slips around
550,III,"them, raises the latch of the rickety door, stoops and enters the"
551,III,miserable hut.
552,III,
553,III,"Crip lies on a meager bed in the corner, with great, feverish eyes,"
554,III,"and little, bony, restless fingers moving nervously upon the covers."
555,III,The night wind blows in streamy draughts between the many crannies and
556,III,flares the weak flame of a candle stuck in its own grease upon the top
557,III,of a wooden box.
558,III,
559,III,"""Hello, mister,"" says Crip. ""I knows yer. Yer works on de paper. I"
560,III,"been laid up wid a rattlin' pain in me chist. Who wins de fight?"""
561,III,
562,III,"""Fitzsimmons won,"" says the Post Man, feeling his hot freckled hand."
563,III,"""Are you in much pain?"""
564,III,
565,III,"""How many rounds?"""
566,III,
567,III,"""First round. Less than two minutes. Can I do anything to make you"
568,III,"easier?"""
569,III,
570,III,"""Geeminetty! dat was quick. Yer might gimme a drink."""
571,III,
572,III,The door opens again and two magnificent beings enter. Crip gives a
573,III,little gasp as his quick eyes fall upon them. Old Boy acknowledges the
574,III,presence of the Post Man by a deep and exaggerated but well
575,III,"intentioned bow, and then he goes and stands by Crip's bedside."
576,III,
577,III,"""Old man,"" he says, with solemnly raised eyebrows, ""Whazzer mazzer?"""
578,III,
579,III,"""Sick,"" says Crip. ""I know yer. Yer gimme a quarter for a paper one"
580,III,"mornin'."""
581,III,
582,III,Old Boy's friend ranges himself in the background. He is a man in a
583,III,"dress suit with a mackintosh and cane, and is not of an obtrusive"
584,III,personality.
585,III,
586,III,"He shows an inclination to brace himself against something, but the"
587,III,"fragile furniture of the hut not promising much support, he stands"
588,III,"uneasily, with a perplexed frown upon his face, awaiting developments."
589,III,
590,III,"""You little devil,"" says Old Boy, smiling down with mock anger at the"
591,III,"little scrap of humanity under the covers, ""Do you know why I've come"
592,III,"to see you?"""
593,III,
594,III,"""N-n-n-no, sir,"" says Crip, the fever flush growing deeper on his"
595,III,"cheeks. He has never seen anything so wonderful as this grand, tall,"
596,III,"handsome man in his black evening suit, with the dark, half-smiling,"
597,III,"half-frowning eyes, and the great diamond flashing on his snowy bosom,"
598,III,"and the tall, shiny hat on the back of his head."
599,III,
600,III,"""Gen'lemen,"" says Old Boy, with a comprehensive wave of his hand, ""I"
601,III,"don't know myself, why I have come here, but I couldn't help it. That"
602,III,little devil's eyes have been in my head for a week. I've never sheen

604,III,long time ago. Sheems to me I knew this little rascal when I was a kid

607,III,"way down here with me to shee zis little sick fellow, 'n now we mus'"
608,III,"do all we can for 'm."""
609,III,
610,III,Old Boy runs his hands into his pockets and draws out the contents
611,III,"thereof and lays all, with lordly indiscrimination, on the ragged"
612,III,quilt that covers Crip.
613,III,
614,III,"""Little devil,"" he says solemnly, ""you mus' buy medicine and get well"
615,III,and come back and shell me papers again. Where in thunder have I seen
616,III,"you before? Never mind. Come on, Bobby--good boy to wait for me--come"
617,III,"on now and le's get a zrink."""
618,III,
619,III,"The two magnificent gentlemen sway around grandly for a moment, make"
620,III,"elaborate but silent adieus in the direction of Crip and the Post Man,"
621,III,"and finally dwindle out into the darkness, where they can be heard"
622,III,urging each other forward to the tremendous feat of remounting the
623,III,steps that lead to the path above.
624,III,
625,III,Presently Crip's mother returns with his medicine and proceeds to make
626,III,him comfortable. She gives a screech of surprise at what she sees
627,III,"lying upon the bed, and proceeds to take an inventory. There are $42"
628,III,"in currency, $6.50 in silver, a lady's silver slipper buckle and an"
629,III,elegant pearl-handled knife with four blades.
630,III,
631,III,"The Post Man sees Crip take his medicine and his fever go down, and"
632,III,promising him to bring down a paper that tells all about the great
633,III,"fight, he moves away. A thought strikes him, and he stops near the"
634,III,door and says:
635,III,
636,III,"""Your husband, now where was he from?"""
637,III,
638,III,"""Oh, plaze yer honor,"" says Crip's mother, ""from Alabama he was, and a"

640,III,"him, and thin he married me."""
641,III,
642,III,As the Post Man departs he hears Crip say to his mother reverentially:

645,III,"don't get full; but if it wasn't him, mammy, I bet a dollar he was Dan"

647,III,
648,III,"As the Post Man trudges back along the dark road to the city, he says"
649,III,to himself:

651,III,"""We have seen tonight good springing up where we would never have"

661,III,"The doctor had long ago ceased his hospital practice, but whenever"

668,III,It must have been nine o'clock when he reached home. The stableman

683,III,"After supper he sat in the library in his favorite arm chair, and she"

774,III,not discontinued his business a month or so ago and moved to other
775,III,parts. Mr. Keeling came to Houston about that time and opened up a
776,III,small detective bureau. He offered his services to the public as a
777,III,detective in rather a modest way. He did not aspire to be a rival of

796,III,client called to see him.
797,III,
798,III,"It was a young lady, apparently about 26 years of age. She was slender"
799,III,and rather tall and neatly dressed. She wore a thin veil which she
800,III,threw back upon her black straw hat after she had taken the chair Mr.
801,III,"Keeling offered her. She had a delicate, refined face, with rather"
802,III,"quick gray eyes, and a slightly nervous manner."
803,III,
804,III,* * * * *
805,III,
806,III,"""I came to see you, sir,"" she said in a sweet, but somewhat sad,"
807,III,"contralto voice, ""because you are comparatively a stranger, and I"
808,III,could not bear to discuss my private affairs with any of my friends. I
809,III,desire to employ you to watch the movements of my husband. Humiliating
810,III,"as the confession is to me, I fear that his affections are no longer"
811,III,mine. Before I married him he was infatuated with a young woman
812,III,connected with a family with whom he boarded. We have been married
813,III,"five years, and very happily, but this young woman has recently moved"
814,III,"to Houston, and I have reasons to suspect that he is paying her"
815,III,attentions. I want you to watch his movements as closely as possible
816,III,and report to me. I will call here at your office every other day at a
817,III,"given time to learn what you have discovered. My name is Mrs. R----,"
818,III,and my husband is well known. He keeps a small jewelry store on
819,III,Street. I will pay you well for your services and here is $20 to begin
820,III,"with."""
821,III,
822,III,The lady handed Mr. Keeling the bill and he took it carelessly as if
823,III,"such things were very, very common in his business."
824,III,
825,III,"He assured her that he would carry out her wishes faithfully, and"
826,III,"asked her to call again the afternoon after the next at four o'clock,"
827,III,for the first report.
828,III,
829,III,The next day Mr. Keeling made the necessary inquiries toward beginning
830,III,"operations. He found the jewelry store, and went inside ostensibly to"
831,III,"have the crystal of his watch tightened. The jeweler, Mr. R----, was a"
832,III,"man apparently 35 years of age, of very quiet manners and industrious"
833,III,"ways. His store was small, but contained a nice selection of goods and"
834,III,"quite a large assortment of diamonds, jewelry and watches. Further"
835,III,inquiry elicited the information that Mr. R was a man of excellent
836,III,"habits, never drank and was always at work at his jeweler's bench."
837,III,
838,III,Mr. Keeling loafed around near the door of the jewelry store for
839,III,several hours that day and was finally rewarded by seeing a flashily
840,III,dressed young woman with black hair and eyes enter the store. Mr.
841,III,"Keeling sauntered nearer the door, where he could see what took place"
842,III,"inside. The young woman walked confidently to the rear of the store,"
843,III,leaned over the counter and spoke familiarly to Mr. R----. He rose
844,III,from his bench and they talked in low tones for a few minutes.
845,III,"Finally, the jeweler handed her some coins, which Mr. Keeling heard"
846,III,clinking as they passed into her hands. The woman then came out and
847,III,walked rapidly down the street.
848,III,
849,III,Mr. Keeling's client was at his office promptly at the time agreed
850,III,upon. She was anxious to know if he had seen anything to corroborate
851,III,her suspicions. The detective told her what he had seen.
852,III,
853,III,"""That is she,"" said the lady, when he had described the young woman"
854,III,"who had entered the store. ""The brazen, bold thing! And so Charles is"
855,III,"giving her money. To think that things should come to this pass."""
856,III,
857,III,The lady pressed her handkerchief to her eyes in an agitated way.
858,III,
859,III,"""Mrs. R----,"" said the detective, ""what is your desire in this matter?"
860,III,"To what point do you wish me to prosecute inquiries?"""
861,III,
862,III,"""I want to see with my own eyes enough to convince me of what I"
863,III,"suspect. I also want witnesses, so I can instigate suit for divorce. I"
864,III,"will not lead the life I am now living any longer."""
865,III,
866,III,She then handed the detective a ten-dollar bill.
867,III,
868,III,"On the day following the next, when she came to Mr. Keeling's office"
869,III,"to hear his report, he said:"
870,III,
871,III,"""I dropped into the store this afternoon on some trifling pretext."
872,III,"This young woman was already there, but she did not remain long."
873,III,"Before she left, she said: 'Charlie, we will have a jolly little"
874,III,supper tonight as you suggest; then we will come around to the store
875,III,and have a nice chat while you finish that setting for the diamond
876,III,"broach with no one to interrupt us.' Tonight, Mrs. R----, I think,"
877,III,will be a good time for you to witness the meeting between your
878,III,"husband and the object of his infatuation, and satisfy your mind how"
879,III,"matters stand."""
880,III,
881,III,"""The wretch,"" cried the lady with flashing eyes. ""He told me at dinner"
882,III,that he would be detained late tonight with some important work. And
883,III,"this is the way he spends his time away from me!"""
884,III,
885,III,"""I suggest,"" said the detective, ""that you conceal yourself in the"
886,III,"store, so you can hear what they say, and when you have heard enough"
887,III,"you can summon witnesses and confront your husband before them."""
888,III,
889,III,"""The very thing,"" said the lady. ""I believe there is a policeman whose"
890,III,beat is along the street the store is on who is acquainted with our
891,III,family. His duties will lead him to be in the vicinity of the store
892,III,"after dark. Why not see him, explain the whole matter to him and when"
893,III,"I have heard enough, let you and him appear as witnesses?"""
894,III,
895,III,"""I will speak with him,"" said the detective, ""and persuade him to"
896,III,"assist us, and you will please come to my office a little before dark"
897,III,"tonight, so we can arrange to trap them."""
898,III,
899,III,* * * * *
900,III,
901,III,The detective hunted up the policeman and explained the situation.
902,III,
903,III,"""That's funny,"" said the guardian of the peace. ""I didn't know R----"
904,III,"was a gay boy at all. But, then, you can never tell about anybody. So"
905,III,"his wife wants to catch him tonight. Let's see, she wants to hide"
906,III,herself inside the store and hear what they say. There's a little room
907,III,in the back of the store where R---- keeps his coal and old boxes. The
908,III,"door between is locked, of course, but if you can get her through that"
909,III,into the store she can hide somewhere. I don't like to mix up in these
910,III,"affairs, but I sympathize with the lady. I've known her ever since we"
911,III,"were children and don't mind helping her to do what she wants."""
912,III,
913,III,About dusk that evening the detective's client came hurriedly to his
914,III,office. She was dressed plainly in black and wore a dark round hat and
915,III,her face was covered with a veil.
916,III,
917,III,"""If Charlie should see me he will not recognize me,"" she said."
918,III,
919,III,Mr. Keeling and the lady strolled down the street opposite the jewelry
920,III,"store, and about eight o'clock the young woman they were watching for"
921,III,"entered the store. Immediately afterwards she came out with Mr. R----,"
922,III,"took his arm, and they hurried away, presumably to their supper."
923,III,
924,III,The detective felt the arm of the lady tremble.
925,III,
926,III,"""The wretch,"" she said bitterly. ""He thinks me at home innocently"
927,III,"waiting for him while he is out carousing with that artful, designing"
928,III,"minx. Oh, the perfidy of man."""
929,III,
930,III,Mr. Keeling took the lady through an open hallway that led into the
931,III,"back yard of the store. The outer door of the back room was unlocked,"
932,III,and they entered.
933,III,
934,III,"""In the store,"" said Mrs. R----, ""near the bench where my husband"
935,III,"works is a large table, the cover of which hangs to the floor. If I"
936,III,"could get under that I could hear every word that was said."""
937,III,
938,III,Mr. Keeling took a big bunch of skeleton keys from his pocket and in a
939,III,few minutes found one that opened the door into the jewelry store. The
940,III,gas was burning from one jet turned very low.
941,III,
942,III,"The lady stepped into the store and said: ""I will bolt this door from"
943,III,"the inside, and I want you to follow my husband and that woman. See if"
944,III,"they are at supper, and if they are, when they start back, you must"
945,III,come back to this room and let me know by tapping thrice on the door.
946,III,After I listen to their conversation long enough I will unbolt the
947,III,"door, and we will confront the guilty pair together. I may need you to"
948,III,"protect me, for I do not know what they might attempt to do to me."""
949,III,
950,III,* * * * *
951,III,
952,III,The detective made his way softly out and followed the jeweler and the
953,III,woman. He soon discovered that they had taken a private room in a
954,III,little out of the way restaurant and had ordered supper. He lingered
955,III,"about until they came out and then hurried back to the store, and"
956,III,"entering the back room, tapped three times on the door."
957,III,
958,III,In a few minutes the jeweler entered with the woman and the detective
959,III,saw the light shine more brightly through a crack in the door. He
960,III,"could hear the man and woman conversing familiarly and constantly, but"
961,III,could not distinguish their words. He slipped around again to the
962,III,"street, and looking through the window, could see Mr. R---- working"
963,III,"away at his jeweler's bench, while the black-haired woman sat close to"
964,III,his side and talked.
965,III,
966,III,"""I'll give them a little time,"" thought Mr. Keeling, and he strolled"
967,III,down the street.
968,III,
969,III,The policeman was standing on the corner.
970,III,
971,III,"The detective told him that Mrs. R---- was concealed in the store, and"
972,III,that the scheme was working nicely.
973,III,
974,III,"""I'll drop back behind now,"" said Mr. Keeling, ""so as to be ready when"
975,III,"the lady springs her trap."""
976,III,
977,III,"The policeman walked back with him, and took a look through the"
978,III,window.
979,III,
980,III,"""They seem to have made up all right,"" said he. ""Where's the other"
981,III,"woman gotten to?"""
982,III,
983,III,"""Why, there she is sitting by him,"" said the detective. ""I'm talking"
984,III,"about the girl R---- had out to supper."""
985,III,
986,III,"""So am I,"" said the detective."
987,III,
988,III,"""You seem to be mixed up,"" said the policeman. ""Do you know that lady"
989,III,"with R----?"""
990,III,
991,III,"""That's the woman he was out with."""
992,III,
993,III,"""That's R----'s wife,"" said the policeman. ""I've known her for fifteen"
994,III,"years."""
995,III,
996,III,"""Then, who--?"" gasped the detective, ""Lord A'mighty, then who's under"
997,III,"the table?"""
998,III,
999,III,Mr. Keeling began to kick at the door of the store. Mr. R---- came
1000,III,forward and opened it.
1001,III,
1002,III,"The policeman and the detective entered. ""Look under that table,"
1003,III,"quick,"" yelled the detective. The policeman raised the cover and"
1004,III,"dragged out a blade dress, a black veil and a woman's wig of black"
1005,III,hair.
1006,III,
1007,III,"""Is this lady your w-w-wife?"" asked Mr. Keeling excitedly, pointing"
1008,III,"out the dark-eyed young woman, who was regarding them in great"
1009,III,surprise.
1010,III,
1011,III,"""Certainly,"" said the jeweler. ""Now what the thunder are you looking"
1012,III,"under my tables and kicking down my door for, if you please?"""
1013,III,

1022,III,"Explanations were made to the jeweler that night, and an hour later"
1023,III,Mr. Keeling sat in his office busily engaged in looking over his
1024,III,albums of crook's photos.
1025,III,
1026,III,"At last he found one, and he stopped turning over the leaves and tore"

1043,III,How Willie Saved Father
1044,III,
1045,III,"Willie Flint was a little Houston boy, six years of age. He was a"
1046,III,"beautiful child, with long golden curls and wondering, innocent blue"
1047,III,"eyes. His father was a respectable, sober citizen, who owned four or"
1048,III,five large business buildings on Main Street. All day long Mr. Flint
1049,III,"toiled among his renters, collecting what was due him, patching up"
1050,III,"broken window panes, nailing down loose boards and repairing places"
1051,III,where the plastering had fallen off. At noon he would sit down upon
1052,III,the stairs of one of his buildings and eat the frugal dinner he had
1053,III,"brought, wrapped up in a piece of newspaper, and think about the hard"
1054,III,times. Gay and elegantly attired clerks and business men would pass up
1055,III,"and down the stairs, but Mr. Flint did not envy them. He lived in a"
1056,III,"little cottage near the large trash pile known as ""Tomato Can"
1057,III,"Heights,"" on one of the principal residence streets of Houston. He was"
1058,III,"perfectly contented to live there with his wife and little boy Willie,"
1059,III,"and eat his frugal but wholesome fare and draw his $1,400 per month"
1060,III,"rent for his buildings. He was industrious and temperate, and hardly a"
1061,III,"day passed that he did not raise the rent of some of his offices, and"
1062,III,lay by a few more dollars for a rainy day.
1063,III,
1064,III,One night Mr. Flint came home ill. He had been pasting up some cheap
1065,III,"green wall paper on an empty stomach, or rather on the wall of one of"
1066,III,"his stores without eating, and it had not agreed with him. He went to"
1067,III,"bed flushed with fever, muttering: ""God help my poor wife and child!"
1068,III,"What will become of them now?"""
1069,III,
1070,III,Mr. Flint sent Willie to the other side of the room and drew a roll of
1071,III,greenbacks from under his pillow.
1072,III,
1073,III,"""Take this,"" he said to his wife, ""to the bank and deposit it. There"
1074,III,"is only $900 there. Some of my renters have not paid me yet, and five"
1075,III,of them want awnings put up at the windows. He who sent the ravens to
1076,III,feed Elijah will provide for us. Come by the baker's and get a nickel
1077,III,"loaf of bread, and then hurry back and pray."""
1078,III,
1079,III,"Willie was pretending to play with his Noah's ark, by charging the"
1080,III,"animals for rent and water, and adding the amounts on his slate, but"
1081,III,he heard what his father said.
1082,III,
1083,III,"As his mother went out, he asked: ""Mamma, is papa too sick to work?"""
1084,III,
1085,III,"""Yes, dear,"" said Mrs. Flint; ""he has a high fever, and I fear will be"
1086,III,"very ill."" After his mother had gone Willie put on his hat and slipped"
1087,III,out the front door.
1088,III,
1089,III,"""I want to do something to help my good, kind papa, who is sick,"" he"
1090,III,said to himself.
1091,III,

1095,III,"Passersby smiled when they saw the little flaxen-haired boy, and many"

1098,III,sick father?
1099,III,
1100,III,"""I know what I will do,"" he said to himself presently. ""I will go up"
1101,III,and raise the rent of several offices and that will make my papa feel
1102,III,"better."""
1103,III,
1104,III,Willie toiled up three flights of stairs of one of his father's
1105,III,"largest buildings. He had to sit down quite often and rest, for he was"
1106,III,short on wind.
1107,III,
1108,III,Away up to the third story was an office rented by two young men who
1109,III,"had just begun to practice law. They had their sign out, and had given"
1110,III,their note to Mr. Flint for the first month's rent. As Willie climbed
1111,III,"the stairs the young lawyers were eating some cheese and crackers,"
1112,III,"with their feet on their desks, and six empty quart beer bottles stood"
1113,III,"upon a table. They were breathing hard, and one of them, who had a"
1114,III,"magnolia in his buttonhole, was telling a funny story about a girl."
1115,III,
1116,III,"Presently one of them took his feet off his desk, opened his eyes and"
1117,III,"said: ""Jeeminy! Bob, get onto his Fauntleroyets."""

1119,III,"The gentleman addressed as Bob also took his feet down, wiped his"

1123,III,A little blue-eyed boy with long golden curls stood in the doorway.
1124,III,
1125,III,"""Come in, sissy,"" said one of the young men."

1136,III,"""Don't worry the little boy,"" said the other young gentleman, whom Bob"
1137,III,"addressed as Sam. ""I'm sure that this is a nice little boy. I say,"
1138,III,"Willie, did you ever hear a gumdrop?"""
1139,III,

1150,III,"""and something must be done for him. Please, kind gentleman, let me"

1154,III,"""It's old Flint's kid,"" said Bob. ""Don't he make your face wide? Say,"
1155,III,"Willie, how much do you want to raise the rent?"""
1156,III,
1157,III,"""What do you pay now?"" asked Willie."

1161,III,"""Could you make it twelve?"""
1162,III,
1163,III,"""Call it fifty,"" said Sam, lighting a black cigar, ""at ninety days,"
1164,III,"and open the beer, Willie, and it's a deal."""
1165,III,
1166,III,"""Don't talk nonsense,"" said Bob. ""I say, Willie, you may raise the"

1170,III,"""Oh, thank you,"" cried Willie, and he ran home with a light heart,"
1171,III,singing merrily.
1172,III,
1173,III,When he got home he found Mr. Flint sinking fast and muttering
1174,III,something about giving his wife a ten-dollar bill.

1205,III,a glory in the eastern sky and spread a white shimmering glamour upon
1206,III,"the black water of the bayou. A phantom tug crept down stream, leaving"
1207,III,"a ghostly, wavering silver wake, and a mysterious lapping and washing"
1208,III,along the unseen shores. Mosquitoes hummed angrily about the borders
1209,III,of the hanging cloud of tobacco smoke. A dank fresh smell arose from
1210,III,bursting buds and wild flowers. We five sat in the chiaroscuro of the
1211,III,"live oaks and cypresses, and babbled as most men and all women will"

1217,III,were more or less hardened to moonlight and roses; one among us was
1218,III,young enough to note the soft effect of Luna's kiss upon the dim tree

1276,III,"till mornin'. I was awful worried about my wife and the kid, who was"

1288,III,"Frio towards home, I seen this mi-ridge. These mi-ridges are sure"
1289,III,wonderful. I never seen but three or four. It was a kind of misty
1290,III,"mornin', with woolly gulf clouds a-flyin' across, and the hollows was"

1293,III,"everything about the yard as plain as if they was only 200 yards away,"

1296,III,"was, but I could see even the white curtains at the windows and the"
1297,III,pet sheep grazin' 'round the corral. It made me feel funny to see

1565,III,
1566,III,A flattering sentence from the report of his sermon in the morning
1567,III,paper came to the preacher's mind:
1568,III,
1569,III,"""His wonderful, magnetic influence is as powerful to move the hearts"
1570,III,"of his roughest, most unlettered hearer, as it is to touch a"
1571,III,responsive chord in the cultured brain of the man of refinement and
1572,III,"taste."""
1573,III,
1574,III,"""And my sermon,"" said the preacher, laying his delicate finger tips"
1575,III,"one against the other, and allowing the adulation even of this being"
1576,III,"to run with a slight exhilaration through his veins. ""Did it awaken in"
1577,III,"you any remorse for the life of sin you have led, or bring any light"
1578,III,"of Divine pity and pardon to your soul, as He promises even unto the"
1579,III,"most degraded and wicked of creation?"""
1580,III,
1581,III,"""Yer sermon, reverend?"" asked the being, carrying a trembling hand to"
1582,III,"the disfiguring wounds upon his face. ""Do you see them cuts and them"
1583,III,bruises? Do you know where I got 'em? I never heard yer sermon. I got
1584,III,dese cuts on de rocks outside when de cop and yer usher fired me out

1592,III,Paderewski's Hair
1593,III,
1594,III,The Post Man had the pleasure of meeting Colonel Warburton Pollock
1595,III,yesterday in the rotunda of the New Hutchins.
1596,III,
1597,III,"Colonel Pollock is one of the most widely known men in this country,"
1598,III,and has probably a more extended acquaintance with distinguished men
1599,III,"of the times than any other living man. He is a wit, a raconteur of"
1600,III,"rare gifts, a born diplomat, and a man of worldwide travel and"
1601,III,experience. Nothing pleases him so well as to relate his extremely
1602,III,interesting reminiscences of men and events to some congenial circle
1603,III,of listeners. His recollections of his associations with famous men
1604,III,and women would fill volumes.
1605,III,
1606,III,Colonel Pollock has a suite of rooms permanently engaged in a
1607,III,"Washington City hotel, where he passes, however, only a small portion"
1608,III,"of his time. He always spends his summers in Europe, principally in"
1609,III,"Naples and Florence, but he rarely stays in one place more than a few"
1610,III,weeks or months.
1611,III,
1612,III,Colonel Pollock is now on his way to South America to look after his
1613,III,interests in some valuable mahogany forests there.
1614,III,
1615,III,The colonel chatted freely and most interestingly about his
1616,III,"experiences, and told to an admiring and attentive group of listeners"
1617,III,some excellent stories about well known people.
1618,III,
1619,III,"""Did I ever tell you?"" he asked, as he puffed at his long black"
1620,III,"Principe, ""about an adventure I had in Africa a few years ago? No?"
1621,III,"Well, I see Paderewski is coming to Houston soon, and the story may"
1622,III,not be inapropos. You have all heard Paderewski's wonderful hair
1623,III,"spoken of, of course. Well, very few people know how he came by it."
1624,III,"This is how it was. A few years ago, some of us made up a party to go"
1625,III,"lion hunting in Africa. There was Nat Goodwin, Paderewski, John L."
1626,III,"Sullivan, Joe Pulitzer, and myself. That was before any of us had"
1627,III,"acquired fame, but we were all ambitious, and everyone of us needed"
1628,III,"the rest and recreation we were taking. We were a congenial, jolly"
1629,III,"crowd, and had a rattling good time on the trip. When we landed we"
1630,III,"hired guides, and stocked up with provisions and ammunition for a"
1631,III,month's trip into the Zambesi country.
1632,III,
1633,III,"""We were all anxious to kill a lion, and we penetrated into quite a"
1634,III,wild and unexplored region.
1635,III,
1636,III,"""We had great times at night over our camp fire, chatting and chaffing"
1637,III,"one another, and thoroughly enjoying ourselves."
1638,III,
1639,III,"""Paderewski was the only member of our party who had been making"
1640,III,money. It was just about the time there was such a furor about his
1641,III,"playing, and he had plied up quite a neat sum from his piano recitals."
1642,III,
1643,III,"""One day Goodwin, Sullivan, Paderewski and I were loafing around camp"
1644,III,just before dinner. We had been out hunting all the morning without
1645,III,success. Pulitzer had not yet shown up. Goodwin and Sullivan got into
1646,III,a dispute about the proper way to dodge and counter a certain upper
1647,III,cut made famous by Heenan. You know Nat Goodwin is quite an athlete
1648,III,"himself, and handles his hands like a professional. Paderewski was"
1649,III,"always a quiet sort of fellow, but amiable and well liked by everyone."
1650,III,He was sitting on the stump of a banyan tree gazing into the distance
1651,III,with a dreamy look in his magnetic eyes. I was loading some
1652,III,"cartridges, and not paying much attention until I heard Sullivan and"
1653,III,Goodwin raise their voices in quite an angry dispute.
1654,III,
1655,III,"""'If I had a pair of gloves, I'd soon prove I am right,' said Nat."
1656,III,
1657,III,"""'I wish you had,' said John. 'In a minute you wouldn't know"
1658,III,anything.'
1659,III,
1660,III,"""'You couldn't stand up two minutes before a man who knew the first"
1661,III,"principles of boxing,' said Goodwin. 'Your weight and your rush are"
1662,III,the only points in your favor.'
1663,III,
1664,III,"""'If we just had some gloves!' said John, grinding his teeth."
1665,III,
1666,III,* * * * *
1667,III,
1668,III,"""They both turned and looked at Paderewski as if by common consent."
1669,III,
1670,III,"""Paderewski at that time had coal black hair, as smooth and straight"
1671,III,"as an Indian's, that hung down his back in a thick mass."
1672,III,
1673,III,"""Sullivan and Goodwin sprang upon him at the same time. I don't know"
1674,III,"which of them did it, but there was the flash of a knife, and in two"
1675,III,seconds Paderewski was scalped as neatly as a Comanche Indian could
1676,III,have done it.
1677,III,
1678,III,"""They divided the mass of hair in two parts, each stuffed his portion"
1679,III,"into two leather cartridge pouches, wound the straps around his"
1680,III,"wrists, and they went at each other in regular prize ring style with"
1681,III,their extemporized boxing gloves.
1682,III,
1683,III,"""Paderewski gave a yell of pain and dismay, and clasped his hands to"
1684,III,his bald head in horror.
1685,III,
1686,III,"""'I am ruined,' he said. 'My professional career is at an end. What"
1687,III,shall I do?'
1688,III,
1689,III,"""I tried to separate John and Nat, but I got a backhander from one of"
1690,III,those Paderewski boxing gloves that stretched me out into a big
1691,III,cactus.
1692,III,
1693,III,* * * * *
1694,III,
1695,III,"""Just then Joe Pulitzer came into camp, dragging a big lion by the"
1696,III,tail he had just shot in a canebrake on the river.
1697,III,
1698,III,"""'Vat's dis?' he asked, gazing through his spectacles at the two"
1699,III,boxers who were hitting at each other and dodging around and at
1700,III,"Paderewski, who was wailing and moaning at the loss of his scalp."
1701,III,
1702,III,"""'I wouldn't have taken $5,000 for that hair,' he groaned."
1703,III,
1704,III,"""'Vat vill you gif,' said Pulitzer, 'for another head of hair yoost as"
1705,III,good?'
1706,III,
1707,III,"""He went up close to Paderewski and they whispered together for a few"
1708,III,minutes. Then Joe got out a tape line and measured Paderewski's head.
1709,III,Then he took a knife and cut out a piece the exact size from the back
1710,III,of the lion's head and fitted it on Paderewski's. He pressed it down
1711,III,"close, and bound it with light bandages."
1712,III,
1713,III,"""It seems almost incredible, but in three days the skin had grown"
1714,III,"fast, the pain was gone, and Paderewski had the loveliest head of"
1715,III,"thick, tawny, flowing hair you ever laid your eyes on."
1716,III,
1717,III,"""I saw Paderewski give Pulitzer a check that evening behind the tent,"
1718,III,"and you can bet it was a stiff one. I don't know the exact figure, but"
1719,III,Joe bought out the _World_ as soon as we got back to New York and has
1720,III,since done well.
1721,III,
1722,III,"""It simply made Paderewski's fortune. That head of hair he wears will"
1723,III,make him a millionaire yet. I never hear him bang down hard on the
1724,III,"bass keys of a piano, but I think of a lion roaring in a South African"
1725,III,"forest, and I'll bet he does, too."""
1726,III,
1727,III,* * * * *
1728,III,
1729,III,"""I like stage people,"" continued Colonel Pollock. ""They are, as a"
1730,III,"rule, the jolliest companions in the world and the most entertaining."
1731,III,Hardly a year passes that I do not make up a congenial party for a
1732,III,"pleasure trip of some kind, and I always have two or three actors in"
1733,III,"the crowd. Now, a year or two ago, some of us got together and took a"
1734,III,"three months' voyage to see the sights. There were DeWolf Hopper, Dr."
1735,III,"Parkhurst, Buffalo Bill, Eugene Field, Steve Brodie, Senator Sherman,"
1736,III,"General Coxey, and Hermann, the great magician, among the party."
1737,III,
1738,III,"""We were guests of the Prince of Wales, and went in his steam yacht,"
1739,III,"the _Albion_. None of us had been to Australia, and the prince wanted"
1740,III,to show us around that country. We had a lovely trip. We were all
1741,III,"congenial souls, and our time on shipboard was one long banquet and"
1742,III,frolic during the whole journey.
1743,III,
1744,III,"""We landed at Melbourne and were met by the governor of Victoria and"
1745,III,"only a few dignitaries of the place, as the prince had sent word that"
1746,III,he wished to pass his visit there strictly incog. In a day or two our
1747,III,entertainers took us on a little tour through New South Wales to show
1748,III,"us the country, and give us some idea of the great mining and sheep"
1749,III,"raising industries of the country. We went through Wagga Wagga, Jumbo"
1750,III,"Junction, and Narraudera, and from there went on horseback through the"
1751,III,great pasture country near Cudduldury.
1752,III,
1753,III,"""When we reached a little town named Cobar in the center of the sheep"
1754,III,"raising district, some loyal Englishmen living there recognized the"
1755,III,"prince, and in an hour the whole town was at our heels, following us"
1756,III,"about, huzzaring and singing 'God save the Queen.'"
1757,III,
1758,III,"""'It's annoying, Pollock,' says the prince to me, 'but it can't be"
1759,III,helped now.'
1760,III,
1761,III,"""Our party rode out into the country to have a look at the sheep"
1762,III,"ranches, and at least two hundred citizens followed us on foot,"
1763,III,staring at us in the deepest admiration and wonder.
1764,III,
1765,III,"""It seemed that it had been a mighty bad year on the sheep men, and"
1766,III,they were feeling gloomy and disheartened over the prospects. The
1767,III,great trouble in Australia is this: The whole continent is overrun
1768,III,"with a prolific breed of rabbits that feed upon the grass and shrubs,"
1769,III,sometimes completely destroying all vegetation within large areas. The
1770,III,"government has a standing offer of something like 50,000 pounds for a"
1771,III,"plan by which these rabbits can be destroyed, but nothing has ever"
1772,III,been discovered that will do the work.
1773,III,
1774,III,"""During years when these rabbits are unusually destructive, the sheep"
1775,III,men suffer great losses by not having sufficient range for their
1776,III,sheep. At the time of our visit the rabbits had almost ruined the
1777,III,country. A few herds of sheep were trying to subsist by nibbling the
1778,III,"higher branches that the rabbits could not reach, but many of the"
1779,III,flocks had to be driven far into the interior. The people were feeling
1780,III,"very sore and blue, and it made them angry to even hear anybody"
1781,III,mention a rabbit.
1782,III,
1783,III,"""About noon we stopped for lunch near the outskirts of a little"
1784,III,"village, and the prince's servants spread a fine cold dinner of potted"
1785,III,"game, pate de foie gras, and cold fowls. The prince had ordered a"
1786,III,"large lot of wines to be sent along, and we had a merry repast."
1787,III,
1788,III,"""The villagers and sheep raisers loafed around by the hundred,"
1789,III,"watching us; and a hungry-looking, starved-out lot they were."
1790,III,
1791,III,* * * * *
1792,III,
1793,III,"""Now, there isn't a more vivacious, genial and convivial man in the"
1794,III,"world than Hermann, the great prestidigitateur. He was the life of the"
1795,III,"party, and as soon as the prince's wine began to mellow him up, he"
1796,III,began to show off his tricks. He threw things in the air that
1797,III,"disappeared from sight, changed water into liquids of all colors,"
1798,III,cooked an omelet in a hat; and pretty soon we were surrounded by a
1799,III,"gaping, awestruck lot of bushmen, both natives and English born."
1800,III,
1801,III,"""Hermann was pleased with the open-mouthed attention he was creating,"
1802,III,"so he walked out into an open space where he could face them all, and"
1803,III,"began drawing rabbits out of his sleeves, his coat collar, his pockets"
1804,III,"by the half dozen. He threw them down, and as fast as they could"
1805,III,scamper away the great magician kept on pulling out more rabbits to
1806,III,the view of the astonished natives.
1807,III,
1808,III,"""Suddenly, with a loud yell, the sheep raisers seized clubs and stones"
1809,III,"and drawing their long sheath knives, rushed upon our party."
1810,III,
1811,III,"""The prince seized my arm."
1812,III,
1813,III,"""'Run for it, Pollock,' he cried, 'this rabbit business has set them"
1814,III,"wild. They'll kill us all if we don't cut our sticks.'"""
1815,III,
1816,III,* * * * *
1817,III,
1818,III,"""I believe,"" said Colonel Pollock, ""that that was the closest shave I"
1819,III,"ever had. I struck out as hard as I could run, with about forty"
1820,III,"natives after me, some of them throwing spears and boomerangs at me"
1821,III,every jump. When I was going over a little hill I turned my head and
1822,III,looked back just in time to see Steve Brodie jump off a bridge into
1823,III,"the Murrumbidgee river at least 200 feet high. All our party escaped,"
1824,III,"and came straggling back within two or three days, but they had some"
1825,III,tough experiences. Senator Sherman was out two nights in the bush and
1826,III,was severely frostbitten.
1827,III,
1828,III,"""I understand DeWolf Hopper is going to dramatize the incident, and"
1829,III,"will produce it next season, appearing as a kangaroo."
1830,III,
1831,III,"""Coxey was caught on the edge of a little stream which he refused to"
1832,III,"enter, and the natives dragged him before an English justice of the"
1833,III,peace who released him the next day. The prince took the whole thing
1834,III,as a good joke. He is an all round good fellow and no mistake.
1835,III,
1836,III,"""Sometime,"" said Colonel Pollock, as he rose to receipt for a"
1837,III,"telegram, ""I will tell you about an adventure I had among the"
1838,III,"Catacombs of Rome, along with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Barney Gibbs and"
1839,III,"the Shah of Persia."" Colonel Pollock leaves on the night train for San"
1840,III,Antonio on his way to the City of Mexico.

1846,III,A Mystery of Many Centuries
1847,III,
1848,III,Up to a few years ago man regarded the means of locomotion possessed
1849,III,by the fair sex as a sacred areanum into which it were desecration to
1850,III,inquire.
1851,III,
1852,III,"The bicycle costume has developed the fact that there are two--well,"
1853,III,that there are two. Whereas man bowed down and worshipped what he
1854,III,"could not understand nor see, when the veil of mystery was rent, his"
1855,III,reverence departed. For generations woman has been supposed in moving
1856,III,from one place to another to simply get there. Whether borne like
1857,III,"Venus in an invisible car drawn by two milk white doves, or wafted"
1858,III,"imperceptibly by the force of her own sweet will, admiring man did not"
1859,III,pause to consider. He only knew that there was a soft rustle of unseen
1860,III,"drapery, an entrancing frou-frou of something agitated but unknown and"
1861,III,the lovely beings would be standing on another spot. Whereat he
1862,III,"wondered, adoring, but uninquisitive. At times beneath the lace-hemmed"
1863,III,"snowy skirts might be seen the toe of a tiny slipper, and perhaps the"
1864,III,"gleam of a silver buckle upon the arch of an instep, but thence"
1865,III,"imagination retired, baffled, but enthralled. In olden times the"
1866,III,sweetest singers among the poets sang to their lutes of those
1867,III,"Lilliputian members, and romance struck a lofty note when it wove the"
1868,III,deathless legend of Cinderella and the slipper of glass. Courtiers
1869,III,have held aloft the silken slipper of the adored one filled with
1870,III,champagne and drank her health. Where is the bicyclist hero who would
1871,III,undertake the task of draining to the good health of his lady love her
1872,III,bicycle gaiter filled with beer?
1873,III,
1874,III,The mysterious and lovelorn damosel no longer chucks roses at us from
1875,III,"her latticed window and sighs to us from afar. She has descended,"
1876,III,"borrowed our clothes, and is our good friend and demands equal rights."
1877,III,We no longer express our admiration by midnight serenades and sonnets.
1878,III,We slap her on the back and feel we have gained a good comrade. But we
1879,III,feel like inserting the following want ad in every paper in the land:
1880,III,
1881,III,"Lost--A maiden dressed in long skirts: blushes sometimes,"

1899,III,A Strange Case
1900,III,
1901,III,"A _Post_ reporter met a young Houston physician the other afternoon,"
1902,III,"with whom he is well acquainted, and suggested that they go into a"
1903,III,neighboring cafe and partake of a cooling lemonade. The physician
1904,III,"agreed, and they were soon seated at a little table in a quiet corner,"
1905,III,"under an electric fan. After the physician had paid for the lemonade,"
1906,III,"the reporter turned the conversation upon his practice, and asked if"
1907,III,he did not meet with some strange cases in his experience.
1908,III,
1909,III,"""Yes, indeed,"" said the doctor, ""many that professional etiquette will"
1910,III,"not allow me to mention, and others that involve no especial secrecy,"
1911,III,but are quite as curious in their way. I had one case only a few weeks
1912,III,"ago that I considered very unusual, and without giving names, I think"
1913,III,"I can relate it to you."""
1914,III,
1915,III,"""By all means do so,"" said the reporter, ""and while you are telling"
1916,III,"it, let us have another lemonade."" The young physician looked serious"
1917,III,"at this proposition, but after searching in his pocket and finding"
1918,III,another quarter he assented.
1919,III,
1920,III,"""About a week ago,"" he began, ""I was sitting in my office, hoping for"
1921,III,"a patient to come in, when I heard footsteps, and looking up, saw a"
1922,III,beautiful young lady enter the room. She advanced at the most curious
1923,III,gait I ever beheld in one so charming. She staggered from side to side
1924,III,"and lurched one way and another, succeeding only by a supreme effort"
1925,III,"in reaching the chair I placed for her. Her face was very lovely, but"
1926,III,showed signs of sadness and melancholy.
1927,III,
1928,III,"""'Doctor,' she said, in a very sweet, but sorrowful voice, 'I want to"
1929,III,"consult you about my condition, and as it is a most unusual affection,"
1930,III,I will have to trouble you to listen to a no doubt tedious discourse
1931,III,upon my family history.'
1932,III,
1933,III,"""'Madam,' said I, 'my time is yours. Anything you have to say that"
1934,III,"will throw light upon your trouble will, of course, benefit me in my"
1935,III,diagnosis.'

1946,III,"""'It is of no consequence,' she continued with a little wave of her"
1947,III,hand. 'Fifty years ago a violent feud broke out between my
1948,III,grandfather's family and another family of old Texas settlers named
1949,III,Redmond. The bloodshed and inhumanities exchanged between the people
1950,III,of each side would fill volumes. The horrors of the old Kentucky and
1951,III,West Virginia feuds were repeated by them. An Adams would shoot a
1952,III,"Redmond from behind a fence, at his table while eating, in a church,"
1953,III,or anywhere; and a Redmond would murder an Adams in like manner. The
1954,III,most violent hatred imaginable existed between them. They poisoned
1955,III,"each other's wells, they killed each other's stock, and if an Adams"
1956,III,"met a Redmond, only one would leave the spot. The children of each"
1957,III,"family were taught to hate the others from the time they could speak,"
1958,III,and so the legacy of antipathy was handed down from father to son and
1959,III,from mother to daughter. For thirty years this battle raged between
1960,III,"them, and one by one the death-dealing rifle and revolver thinned the"
1961,III,families until one day just twenty years ago there remained but a
1962,III,"single representative of each family, Lemuel Adams and Louisa Redmond."
1963,III,"They were both young and handsome, and at their first meeting forgot"
1964,III,the ancient feud of their families and loved each other. They married
1965,III,"at once, and thus ended the great Adams-Redmond feud. But, alas, sir,"
1966,III,the inherited discord and hatred of so many years' standing was
1967,III,destined to rebound upon an innocent victim.'
1968,III,
1969,III,"""'I was the child of that marriage, and the Adams and Redmond blood"
1970,III,"would not mingle. As a babe I was like any other, and was even"
1971,III,considered unusually prepossessing.'
1972,III,
1973,III,"""'I can well believe that, madam,' I interrupted."
1974,III,
1975,III,"""The lady colored slightly and went on: 'As I grew older a strange"
1976,III,warring and many adverse impulses began to sway me. Every thought or
1977,III,movement I made was met by a contradictory one. It was the result of
1978,III,hereditary antagonism. Half of me was Adams and the other half
1979,III,"Redmond. If I attempted to look at an object, one of my eyes would"
1980,III,"gaze in another direction. If I tried to salt a potato while eating,"
1981,III,the other hand would involuntarily reach out and sprinkle it with
1982,III,sugar.
1983,III,
1984,III,"""'Hundreds of times while playing the piano, while one hand would"
1985,III,"strike the notes of a lovely Beethoven sonata, I could not keep the"
1986,III,"other from pounding out ""Over the Garden Wall,"" or ""The Skidmore"
1987,III,"Guards."" The Adams and the Redmond blood would not flow in harmony. If"
1988,III,"I went into an ice cream saloon, I would order a vanilla cream in"
1989,III,"spite of myself, when my very soul was clamoring for lemon. Many a"
1990,III,"time I would strive with every nerve to disrobe for the night, and the"
1991,III,opposing influence would be so strong that I have instead put on my
1992,III,finest and most elaborate clothing and retired with my shoes on. Have
1993,III,"you ever met with a similar case, doctor?'"
1994,III,
1995,III,"""'Never,' I said. 'It is indeed remarkable. And you have never"
1996,III,succeeded in overcoming the adverse tendency?'
1997,III,
1998,III,"""Oh, yes. By constant efforts and daily exercise I have succeeded so"
1999,III,far that it troubles me now in one respect only. With one exception I
2000,III,am now entirely released from its influence. It is my locomotion that
2001,III,is affected. My l-lower limbs refuse to coincide in their movements.
2002,III,"If I try to walk in a certain direction, one--one of them will take"
2003,III,"the step I desire, and the other tries to go by an entirely different"
2004,III,"route. It seems that one l--one of them is Adams, and the other"
2005,III,Redmond. Absolutely the only time when they agree is when I ride a
2006,III,"bicycle, and as one goes up when the other is going down, their"
2007,III,opposite movements of course facilitate my progress; but when
2008,III,endeavoring to walk I find them utterly unmanageable. You observed my
2009,III,"entrance into this room. Is there anything you can do for me, doctor?'"
2010,III,
2011,III,"""'Your case is indeed a strange one,' I said. 'I will consider the"
2012,III,"situation, and if you will call tomorrow at 10 o'clock I will"
2013,III,prescribe for you.'
2014,III,
2015,III,"""She rose from her chair, and I assisted her down the stairs to her"
2016,III,"carriage, which waited below. Such a sprawling, ungainly, mixed up"
2017,III,walk I never saw before.
2018,III,
2019,III,"""I meditated over her case for a long time that night and consulted"
2020,III,"all the authorities on locomotor ataxia, and diseases of the muscles,"
2021,III,"that I could find. I found nothing covering her case, and about"
2022,III,midnight I wandered out along the streets for a breath of cool air. I
2023,III,"passed a store kept by an old German whom I knew, and dropped in to"
2024,III,speak a word with him. I had noticed some time before two tame deer he
2025,III,kept running about in a paddock in his yard. I asked him about them.
2026,III,"He told me that they had been fighting, and had not been able to"
2027,III,"agree, so he had separated them, placing each one in a separate yard."
2028,III,Of a sudden an idea came to me.
2029,III,
2030,III,"""The next day at ten the young lady came to my office. I had a"
2031,III,"prescription ready for her. I gave it to her, she read it, flushed and"
2032,III,was inclined to be angry.
2033,III,
2034,III,"""'Try it, madam,' I said."
2035,III,
2036,III,"""She agreed to do so, and only yesterday I saw her on the street,"
2037,III,"walking as gracefully and easily as any lady in the city."""
2038,III,
2039,III,"""What was your prescription?"" asked the reporter."
2040,III,
2041,III,"""It was simply to wear a pair of bloomers,"" said the young physician."
2042,III,"""You see by separating the opposing factions harmony was restored. The"
2043,III,"Adams and the Redmond divisions no longer clashed, and the cure of the"
2044,III,"patient was complete. Let me see,"" continued the physician, ""it is"
2045,III,"nearly half past seven, and I have an engagement to call upon her at"
2046,III,"eight. In confidence, I may say that she has consented to change her"
2047,III,name to mine at an early date. I would not have you repeat what I have
2048,III,"told you, of course."""
2049,III,
2050,III,"""To be sure, I will not,"" said the reporter. ""But won't you take"
2051,III,"another lemo--"""
2052,III,
2053,III,"""No, no, thank you,"" said the doctor, rising hurriedly, ""I must go."
2054,III,"Good evening. I will see you again in a few days."""

2060,III,Simmon's Saturday Night
2061,III,
2062,III,How a Guileless Cattle Man Saw the Sights in Houston
2063,III,
2064,III,One fine Saturday afternoon a young man got off the 9:10 p.m. Katy
2065,III,"train at the Houston depot, and looked about him in rather a"
2066,III,"bewildered way. He was deliriously pastoral in his appearance, and"
2067,III,presented an aspect almost as rural as that of the young countryman
2068,III,upon the stage as depicted by our leading comedians. He wore a very
2069,III,long black coat of the cut that has perpetuated the name of the late
2070,III,"Prince Albert, such as is seen on Sundays at country churches, a pair"
2071,III,"of pantaloons too short for his somewhat lengthy limbs, and a"
2072,III,wondrously tied scarf of deep crimson spotted with green. His face was
2073,III,"smoothly shaven, and wore a look of deep wonder, if not apprehension,"
2074,III,and his blue eyes were stretched to their widest as he viewed the
2075,III,sights about him. In his hand he carried a long carpet bag of the old
2076,III,"style, made of some shiny substance resembling black oil cloth."
2077,III,
2078,III,This young gentleman climbed nervously upon an electric car that was
2079,III,"pointed out to him as going into the center of the city, and held his"
2080,III,"carpet bag upon his knees, clasping it with both hands, as if he"
2081,III,distrusted the other people upon the car.
2082,III,
2083,III,"As the car started again with a loud hum and scattering of sparks, he"
2084,III,grasped the arm of the seat in such a startled way that the conductor
2085,III,could not repress a smile.
2086,III,
2087,III,"When the young man was approached for his fare, he opened the carpet"
2088,III,"bag, pulling out a lot of socks and handkerchiefs, and after searching"
2089,III,for some time drew forth an old-fashioned beaded purse from which he
2090,III,drew a nickel and handed it to the conductor.
2091,III,
2092,III,When the car arrived at Main Street the young man requested that it be
2093,III,"stopped, and climbed off. He wandered up the side walk, stopping to"
2094,III,"look with awe and admiration in the jewelers' windows, and his long"
2095,III,"boot heels and awkward, mincing gait caused much amusement to"
2096,III,passersby.
2097,III,
2098,III,Then it was that a well-dressed gentleman wearing a handsome light
2099,III,"Melton overcoat happened to pass, and his beautiful Malacca"
2100,III,gold-headed cane accidentally touched the elbow of the verdant-looking
2101,III,young man.
2102,III,
2103,III,"""I beg a thousand pardons,"" said the well-dressed gentleman."
2104,III,
2105,III,"""It's all right, pardner,"" said the young man with a friendly smile."
2106,III,"""You ain't done no damage. You can't faze a Texas cow man with no"
2107,III,"plaything like that. Don't mention it."""
2108,III,
2109,III,"The well-dressed man bowed, and went leisurely on his way. The young"
2110,III,"man stumbled on up Main Street to a corner, then turned in an aimless"
2111,III,way to the right and walked another block. There he looked up and saw
2112,III,"the illuminated clock in the market house tower, and drawing from his"
2113,III,"vest pocket an immense silver watch fully as large as a saucer, he"
2114,III,wound it up with a key and set its hands with the clock in the tower.
2115,III,While he was doing this a well-dressed gentleman carrying a
2116,III,gold-headed Malacca cane slipped past and walked softly down the shady
2117,III,"side of the street, stopped in a deep shadow and seemed to be waiting"
2118,III,for someone.
2119,III,
2120,III,About fifteen minutes later the young man entered a restaurant on
2121,III,Congress Street and took his seat timidly at a table. He drew another
2122,III,chair close to his side and deposited carefully therein his carpet
2123,III,bag. Five minutes later a well-dressed man with a gold-headed Malacca
2124,III,"cane entered in a great hurry and after hanging up his silk hat,"
2125,III,"seated himself, almost out of breath, at the same table. Then, looking"
2126,III,"up, he recognized the young man whom he had seen gazing in the"
2127,III,"jeweler's window, and smiling pleasantly remarked:"
2128,III,
2129,III,"""Ah, we meet again, sir. I have just had a most exhausting race to"
2130,III,"catch a train. You see, I am the paymaster of the Southern Pacific"
2131,III,"Railway Company, and am on my way to pay off the hands down the road."
2132,III,"I missed my train by about three minutes. It's very awkward, too, as I"
2133,III,"have nearly two thousand dollars on my person, and I am entirely"
2134,III,"unacquainted in Houston."""
2135,III,
2136,III,"""Dod gast it, colonel,"" said the young man, ""I'm in the same fix. I'm"
2137,III,"just getting back from Kansas City, where I sold a drove of"
2138,III,"two-year-olds, and I haven't had time to do anything with the money."
2139,III,"You beat me on the amount, though; I ain't got but $900."""
2140,III,
2141,III,"The well-dressed gentleman took a large roll of bills from his pocket,"
2142,III,"skinned off one with which to pay for his supper, and returned the"
2143,III,rest carefully to the inside pocket of his coat.
2144,III,
2145,III,"""We seem to be about in the same situation, indeed,"" he said. ""I very"
2146,III,much dislike to carry so much money on my person all night. Suppose we
2147,III,"form a mutual protection society, and in the meantime walk about and"
2148,III,"see what sights there are to be seen in town."""
2149,III,
2150,III,At first the young man appeared suddenly suspicious at this
2151,III,"proposition, and became coldly reserved, but gradually thawed under"
2152,III,"the frank and unassuming politeness of the well-dressed man, and when"
2153,III,"that gentleman insisted upon paying for both suppers, his doubts"
2154,III,"seemed to vanish, and he became not only confidential, but actually"
2155,III,loquacious. He informed the well-dressed man that his name was
2156,III,"Simmons, that he owned a nice little ranch in Encinal County, and that"
2157,III,this was his first trip out of Texas. The well-dressed man said his
2158,III,"name was Clancy, called ""Captain"" by his friends, that he lived in"
2159,III,"Dallas, and was a member of the Young Men's Christian Association at"
2160,III,"that place. He handed Mr. Simmons a card on which was printed ""Captain"
2161,III,"Richard Saxon Clancy,"" and below was scribbled somewhat hastily in"
2162,III,"pencil, ""With M. K. & T. Ry. Co."""
2163,III,
2164,III,* * * * *
2165,III,
2166,III,"""Now,"" said Mr. Simmons, when they had finished supper, ""I'm sorter"
2167,III,"shy about proposin' it, you bein' a stranger, but I'm in for havin' a"
2168,III,"glass of beer. If you don't like the scheme, why, excuse me, and don't"
2169,III,"think hard of me for suggestin' it."""
2170,III,
2171,III,"Captain Chancy smiled indulgently. ""Have a care,"" he said, in a"
2172,III,"sprightly bantering tone. ""Remember, you and I must take care of"
2173,III,ourselves tonight. I am responsible to the railroad company for the
2174,III,"funds I have, and besides, I rarely ever touch beer--well, I guess one"
2175,III,"glass won't hurt me."""
2176,III,
2177,III,Mr. Simmons opened the carpet bag and after some search found the bead
2178,III,"purse, from which he drew a dime, and suggested the immediate"
2179,III,investment of it. Captain Clancy remembered to have heard a friend say
2180,III,"that there was a quiet saloon on--let's see, what street was it?"
2181,III,
2182,III,After some hesitation and search they came upon a place with swinging
2183,III,"doors where a light was hanging outside, and the captain suggested"
2184,III,that they could probably get a glass of beer within. They entered and
2185,III,"found themselves before a gorgeous bar, ablaze with lights and"
2186,III,"mirrors, at which lounged five or six men of a rather rough and"
2187,III,night-owlish appearance.
2188,III,
2189,III,"Mr. Simmons called for two glasses of beer, and when they had drunk it"
2190,III,he laid his dime upon the counter.
2191,III,
2192,III,"""Wot's eatin' you?"" said the bartender. ""They is two for. Cough up"
2193,III,"some more right away once."""
2194,III,
2195,III,"""See here,"" said Mr. Simmons, ""beer is 5 cents a glass everywheres."
2196,III,"Don't you take me for no country jay."""
2197,III,
2198,III,Captain Clancy whispered that they had better pay what was asked than
2199,III,"get into a difficulty. ""It seems a rough sort of place,"" he said, ""and"
2200,III,you must remember it won't do to endanger ourselves while we have our
2201,III,"money about us. Let me pay the 15 cents additional."""
2202,III,
2203,III,"""No, you don't,"" said Mr. Simmons. ""I guess when I treat I foot the"
2204,III,"whole bill."" He went down into the carpet bag again and brought forth"
2205,III,three more nickels.
2206,III,
2207,III,"Just then an orchestra near at hand struck up in a lively air, and Mr."
2208,III,Simmons turned to look whence it came.
2209,III,
2210,III,The bartender winked at Captain Clancy and said softly:
2211,III,
2212,III,"""Struck it rich, eh, Jimmy, old boy?"""
2213,III,
2214,III,"""Think it will pay,"" said the captain, as softly, closing his left eye"
2215,III,at the bartender.
2216,III,
2217,III,"""Say,"" said Mr. Simmons, ""whatever have you got in there?"" pointing in"
2218,III,the direction of the music.
2219,III,
2220,III,"""Finest high-class musical and dramatic entertainment in the South,"""
2221,III,"said the bartender. ""Refined and elevatin' specialties by"
2222,III,"distinguished artists. Walk in, gents."""
2223,III,
2224,III,"""It's a play show, by gum,"" said Mr. Simmons. ""Shall we go in?"""
2225,III,
2226,III,"""I don't like the looks of the place much,"" said Captain Clancy, ""but"
2227,III,"let's have a look at it, anyhow, to pass away the time; let's see,"
2228,III,it's just half past ten; we can look on a while and then go up to the
2229,III,"hotel and get to bed by eleven-thirty. Let me pay for tickets."""
2230,III,
2231,III,"""All right,"" said Mr. Simmons, ""I paid for the beer."""
2232,III,
2233,III,"The bartender pointed out the way through a little hallway, where they"
2234,III,entered another door and found a very glib gentleman who persuaded
2235,III,them to buy tickets that admitted them upstairs. They ascended and
2236,III,found themselves in the family circle of a little theater. There were
2237,III,"about twenty or thirty men and boys scattered about among the seats,"
2238,III,and the performance seemed quite well under way. On the stage a very
2239,III,"exaggerated Irishman was chasing a very exaggerated negro with an ax,"
2240,III,while a soubrettish young lady dressed in a ruffle and blue tights
2241,III,"stood upon a barrel and screamed something in a high, cracked voice."
2242,III,
2243,III,* * * * *
2244,III,
2245,III,"""I shouldn't like it if there should happen to be anyone downstairs"
2246,III,"that knows me,"" said the captain. ""Suppose we take one of these"
2247,III,"boxes."" They went into a little box, screened from view by soiled"
2248,III,"cheap lace curtains, containing four or five chairs and a little table"
2249,III,with little rings all over it made by the bottoms of wet glasses.
2250,III,
2251,III,Mr. Simmons was delighted with the performance. He laughed
2252,III,"unrestrainedly at the jokes of the comedian, and leaned half out of"
2253,III,the box to applaud when the DeVere sisters did their song and dance
2254,III,and split specialty. Captain Clancy leaned back in his chair and
2255,III,"hardly looked at the stage, but on his face was an expression of large"
2256,III,"content, and a tranquil smile. Mr. Simmons kept the carpet bag in both"
2257,III,"hands all this time. Presently, while he was listening with apparent"
2258,III,"rapture to a topical song by Mlle. Fanchon, the Parisian nightingale,"
2259,III,he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He turned about and beheld a
2260,III,vision that seemed to take away his breath. Two radiant beings in
2261,III,"white, with blue ribbons, and showing quite a stretch of black ribbed"
2262,III,stockings were in the box. Mr. Simmons hugged his carpet bag to his
2263,III,breast and started up in embarrassed alarm.
2264,III,
2265,III,"""Don't shy, old man,"" said one of them. ""Sit down and buy some beer."""
2266,III,
2267,III,Mr. Simmons seemed so full of blushes and perturbation for a while
2268,III,"that he scarcely knew what he was doing, but Captain Clancy seemed so"
2269,III,"cool and easy, and began to chat so companionably with the ladies that"
2270,III,"he presently took courage, and the next quarter of an hour found the"
2271,III,"four seated opposite one another at the little table, and a colored"
2272,III,waiter was kept busy bringing bottles of beer from the bar and
2273,III,carrying away empty glasses. Mr. Simmons grew absolutely hilarious. He
2274,III,"told funny stories about ranch life, and spoke quite boastingly about"
2275,III,the gay times he had had in Kansas City during the three days he was
2276,III,there.
2277,III,
2278,III,"""Oh, you're a bold, bad man,"" said one of the young ladies, called"
2279,III,"Violet. ""If Lillie and Jim--I mean your friend, wasn't in here I'd be"
2280,III,"real 'fraid of you."""
2281,III,
2282,III,"""Go way, now,"" said Mr. Simmons; ""you know I ain't nothin' of that"
2283,III,"sort. Bring some more beer there, you colored feller!"""
2284,III,
2285,III,The party certainly were enjoying themselves. Presently Violet leaned
2286,III,over the railing and called Mr. Simmons' attention to a lady that was
2287,III,"singing on the stage. Mr. Simmons turned his back, and as he did so"
2288,III,Captain Clancy quickly drew from his pocket a small vial and poured
2289,III,the contents into the glass of beer on Mr. Simmons' side of the waiter
2290,III,that had just been brought in.
2291,III,
2292,III,"""Here, you all,"" called the lady addressed as Lillie, ""the beer's"
2293,III,"getting cold."" Mr. Simmons and Violet turned back to the table, and"
2294,III,"Mr. Simmons accidentally stumbled over his carpet bag, which he had"
2295,III,actually set down for a moment upon the floor. He fell sprawling
2296,III,"across the table, striking the edge of the waiter with his hand and"
2297,III,"nearly turning Captain Clancy over in his chair, but spilling none of"
2298,III,the beer.
2299,III,
2300,III,"""Excuse me,"" he said, turning very red. ""Got my foot caught. I'm as"
2301,III,"awkward as a cowboy at a dance. Well, here's luck."""
2302,III,
2303,III,"Everybody drank the beer, and Lillie began to hum a little song. In"
2304,III,about a minute Violet reeled around in her chair and tumbled off on
2305,III,"the floor in a confused heap of white muslin, blondined hair and black"
2306,III,stockings.
2307,III,
2308,III,Captain Clancy seemed much vexed. He shot a steel blue flash from his
2309,III,"eyes at Lillie and said something very much like ""d--n it"" to himself."
2310,III,
2311,III,"""Great heavens!"" cried Mr. Simmons, ""this lady has fainted. Call a"
2312,III,"doctor, or get some water or somethin' quick."""
2313,III,
2314,III,"""Say,"" said Lillie, lighting a cigarette, ""don't get woozy. She'll"
2315,III,"sleep it off. You gents get out for a while. Say, J-Mister, tell the"
2316,III,"bartender to send Sam up as you go out. Good night."""
2317,III,
2318,III,"""We had better go,"" said the captain."
2319,III,
2320,III,"Mr. Simmons, with many protestations of sympathy and anxiety, was led"
2321,III,"away by Captain Clancy downstairs, where he delivered the message, and"
2322,III,thence out into the cool night air.
2323,III,
2324,III,"He was feeling pretty strongly the effects of the beer he had drunk,"
2325,III,and leaned heavily upon the captain's arm. Captain Clancy assured him
2326,III,"that the lady would be all right in a little while, that she had"
2327,III,"merely drunk a little too much beer, which had affected her rather"
2328,III,"suddenly, and succeeded in restoring Mr. Simmons to his former"
2329,III,cheerful spirits.
2330,III,
2331,III,"""It is not yet half past eleven,"" said the captain. ""How would you"
2332,III,like to go up into one of the gambling rooms just to look on a while?
2333,III,"It is a very interesting sight."""
2334,III,
2335,III,"""Just the thing,"" said Mr. Simmons. ""They are not new things to me at"
2336,III,all. Twice I have been in 'em in San Antone. Saw a feller win $18 one
2337,III,"night in this game you play with little buttons on little boards."""
2338,III,
2339,III,"""Keno, I believe,"" said the captain. ""Yes, that's it--keno."""
2340,III,
2341,III,* * * * *
2342,III,
2343,III,I shall not undertake to describe the locality of the apartments to
2344,III,which our visitors next went. Gambling houses are almost unknown in
2345,III,"Houston, and as this is a true story, the attempt to give a definite"
2346,III,location to such an institution in a city of the well known morality
2347,III,of Houston would meet with incredulity. Neither is it clear how they
2348,III,"managed to find such a place, both of them being strangers, but by"
2349,III,"some accidental blunder, Captain Clancy led Mr. Simmons up a brightly"
2350,III,"lighted and carpeted stair into a large apartment, where a goodly"
2351,III,"crowd of men were gathered, trying their luck at the different games"
2352,III,usually found in a well appointed gambling house.
2353,III,
2354,III,The stairway opened into the room nearly at the end farthest from the
2355,III,street. Immediately in front of the two gentlemen when they entered
2356,III,"was a room in which were two or three round tables and chairs, at that"
2357,III,time unoccupied.
2358,III,
2359,III,Captain Clancy and Mr. Simmons walked about the larger room for a
2360,III,"while, gazing upon the players as they won or lost in the vicissitudes"
2361,III,and fortunes of the games. The men in the room viewed Mr. Simmons with
2362,III,ill-concealed hilarity. His carpet bag seemed to create a vast deal of
2363,III,"merriment, and every man in the room, while betraying much amusement,"
2364,III,"still gazed upon him with longing and hungry eyes, as upon some choice"
2365,III,tit-bit upon which they fain would feast.
2366,III,
2367,III,One fat man with a dyed mustache nudged Captain Clancy in the side and
2368,III,said:
2369,III,
2370,III,"""Gad! Jimmy, can't you let me in on it?"""
2371,III,
2372,III,The captain frowned and the fat man moved away with a sigh. Mr.
2373,III,Simmons was interested almost to excitement. Presently he said:
2374,III,
2375,III,"""Say, I don't know how it will strike you, cap'n, but I guess I must"
2376,III,"have some sportin' blood in me. Now, I don't gamble, but I'm the"
2377,III,darnedest checker player in Southwest Texas. Let's go in that other
2378,III,"room, and I'll play you some checkers and the man what loses buys a"
2379,III,"glass of beer for both of us."""
2380,III,
2381,III,"""Now, Mr. Simmons,"" said the captain, raising a warning finger and"
2382,III,"smiling. ""Remember our mutual protection society. I don't like this"
2383,III,"place at all. We had better be out of it. However, I used to be the"
2384,III,crack checker and croquet player in our Young Men's Christian
2385,III,"Association--just a game or two, now."""
2386,III,
2387,III,"They played a game or two, and then they played half a dozen more. The"
2388,III,captain won every game. Mr. Simmons was much vexed. He grew very red
2389,III,in the face as his reputation as a checker player began to vanish.
2390,III,
2391,III,"""Confound it,"" he said, ""I'm out 70 cents. Gimmie a chance to get"
2392,III,"even. I'd give it to you if I was ahead."""
2393,III,
2394,III,"""Why, certainly,"" said the captain, ""but checkers is rather tiresome."
2395,III,Some other way suit you? Let's have in a deck of cards and play a few
2396,III,"hands until you get even."""
2397,III,
2398,III,"""Any way,"" said Mr. Simmons. His hat was on the back of his head; his"
2399,III,light-blue eyes were blinking and somewhat unsteady. His red and green
2400,III,spotted tie was almost under one ear. He sat with the black carpet bag
2401,III,"in his lap, and his checked trousers had drawn half way up to his"
2402,III,knees.
2403,III,
2404,III,"""What, oh, what,"" said the captain softly, to himself, ""have I done to"
2405,III,deserve this manna descending to me in the wilderness; this good thing
2406,III,dropping into my hands as if it were greased; this great big soft snap
2407,III,"coming my way without a ripple. It's too good to be true."""
2408,III,
2409,III,The captain struck a little bell and a waiter brought a deck of cards.
2410,III,
2411,III,"""Let's call it poker,"" said the captain. Mr. Simmons rose to his feet."
2412,III,
2413,III,"""That's a gambling game,"" he said severely. ""I ain't no gambler."""
2414,III,
2415,III,"""Neither am I, Mr. Simmons,"" said the captain with a sudden dignity"
2416,III,"and a trifle of a frown. ""A game of poker for insignificant stakes"
2417,III,between gentlemen is entirely allowable in the circles in which I have
2418,III,"moved, and any institution--"""
2419,III,
2420,III,"""Oh, dang it all,"" said Mr. Simmons, ""I didn't mean anything. I've"
2421,III,played some on the ranch with the boys of nights for grains of corn.

2426,III,The old story of the hawk and the pigeon has been told so often that
2427,III,the details are apt to weary. From a stake of 10 cents they rose to 50
2428,III,"cents and a dollar. Mr. Simmons won, of course. He had taken the bead"
2429,III,"purse out of his bag and therefrom abstracted certain silver dollars,"
2430,III,"and later on, $25 in bills. Once he held up a package from the carpet"
2431,III,bag tied with a string and winked at the captain.
2432,III,
2433,III,"""That's the nine hundred,"" he said."
2434,III,
2435,III,"The captain won a pot occasionally, but the bulk of the money was"
2436,III,"going to Mr. Simmons, who was jubilant but sympathetic."
2437,III,
2438,III,"""You're out of luck,"" he said jollily, but thickly. He was"
2439,III,"considerably under the influence of the beer he had drunk, to all"
2440,III,appearances. The captain looked worried and anxious.
2441,III,
2442,III,"""That's nearly all my expense money,"" he said moodily. ""I say,"
2443,III,"Simmons, take off the limit and give a feller a chance to get even."""
2444,III,
2445,III,"""What's that?"" asked Mr. Simmons. ""You mean bet any amount we please?"""
2446,III,
2447,III,"""Yes."""
2448,III,
2449,III,"""Let 'er go,"" said Mr. Simmons. ""Shay, zis beer (hic) make'm me"
2450,III,"shorter shick."""
2451,III,
2452,III,"Mr. Simmons seemed to play a very loose game, and his luck began to"
2453,III,"desert him. He lost a large portion of his winnings on an ace full,"
2454,III,and had several fine hands beaten. In a little while his velvet was
2455,III,gone and the next hand lost him all his little capital. He grew more
2456,III,"deeply flushed, and his round light eyes shone with an excited stare."
2457,III,"He once more opened the black carpet bag, took out his pocket knife"
2458,III,and put both hands inside. The captain heard him cut the string of the
2459,III,"package and out came the hands grasping a mass of fives, tens and"
2460,III,twenties. The carpet bag still kept its place in his lap.
2461,III,
2462,III,"""Bring 'sh s'm beer,"" said Mr. Simmons, loudly. ""Jolly f'ler ze"

2468,III,"Captain Richard Saxon Clancy, paymaster (?) of the M. K. & T. Railway"
2469,III,"Company, drew himself together, his time had come. The manna was about"
2470,III,to descend. The pigeon was already fluttering in his talons. The
2471,III,victim was in exactly the right stage of drunkenness; enough to be
2472,III,"reckless and not too observant, but not too much so to prevent his"
2473,III,playing the game.
2474,III,
2475,III,The captain coughed rather loudly. One or two men strolled in from the
2476,III,other room and watched the game silently. The captain coughed again. A
2477,III,pale young man with gloomy eyes and an unhealthy-looking face lounged
2478,III,"around somewhat back of Mr. Simmons' chair, and listlessly looked on."
2479,III,"Every time a hand was dealt or a draw made, he would scratch his ear,"
2480,III,"touch his nose, pull his mustache or play with a button on his vest."
2481,III,"It was strange to see how much the captain watched this young man, who"
2482,III,certainly had nothing to do with the game.
2483,III,
2484,III,Still the captain won. When Mr. Simmons won a pot it was sure to be a
2485,III,small one.
2486,III,
2487,III,The captain thought the time ripe for his coup de grace. He struck the
2488,III,"bell, and the waiter came."
2489,III,
2490,III,"""Bring a fresh deck, Mike,"" he said, ""these are getting worn."" Mr."
2491,III,"Simmons was too confused to notice that the captain, a stranger in the"
2492,III,"city, called the waiter familiarly by his given name."
2493,III,
2494,III,"The captain dealt the cards, and Mr. Simmons cut them in an awkward"
2495,III,and bungling way. Then the fatal hand was dealt. It was the captain's
2496,III,"favorite. Four kings and the seven of spades to his opponent, four"
2497,III,aces and the deuce of diamonds to himself. Any other cards would do as
2498,III,"well as the spade and the diamond, but the captain had a weakness for"
2499,III,those two cards.
2500,III,
2501,III,He noticed the ill-concealed pleasure on the face of Mr. Simmons as he
2502,III,gazed at his hand. Mr. Simmons stood pat; the captain drew one card.
2503,III,The young man behind Mr. Simmons' chair had moved away. It was no
2504,III,longer necessary for him to scratch his ear and touch his vest button.
2505,III,He knew the captain's coup de grace as well as he himself.
2506,III,
2507,III,Mr. Simmons clutched his cards tightly in his hand and tried in vain
2508,III,to conceal his eagerness. The captain examined the new card he had
2509,III,"drawn with exaggerated anxiety, and heaved a sigh that intended to"
2510,III,convey to Mr. Simmons the information that he had made his hand good.
2511,III,
2512,III,The betting began. Mr. Simmons threw in his money feverishly and
2513,III,"quickly; the captain saw each bet, and raised only after affected deep"
2514,III,"deliberation. Mr. Simmons raised back gleefully, drunkenly and"
2515,III,confidently. When the pot contained about $200 the captain's brows
2516,III,"went together, and two faint lines traced themselves from his nostrils"
2517,III,"to the corners of his mouth, and he made a raise of a hundred. Mr."
2518,III,Simmons laid his hand down carefully on the table and went down in his
2519,III,carpet bag again. This time he drew out two $500 bills and laid them
2520,III,on top of the pot.
2521,III,
2522,III,"""I'm goin' busted on this hand,"" said Mr. Simmons. ""'F I didn't zhe"
2523,III,"boys 'n Encinal County 'd run me out for a coward. Whoop 'em up,"
2524,III,"cap'n."""
2525,III,
2526,III,"""Send Charlie over here,"" said Captain Clancy to one of the"
2527,III,bystanders. The fat man with the dyed mustache came over and whispered
2528,III,with the captain. Then he went away and came back with a stack of gold
2529,III,and bills and counted out the thousand dollars to call Mr. Simmons'
2530,III,bet.
2531,III,
2532,III,"""I call,"" said the captain."
2533,III,
2534,III,Then a queer thing happened.
2535,III,
2536,III,"Mr. Simmons rose lightly to his feet, spread his hand face upward upon"
2537,III,"the table, and with the same arm movement swept the pile of money into"
2538,III,his capacious carpet bag.
2539,III,
2540,III,With bulging eyes and a sulphurous oath the captain looked for the
2541,III,four kings and the seven of spades he had dealth Mr. Simmons. What he
2542,III,saw was a queen high straight heart flush.
2543,III,
2544,III,"The captain made a spring, and the pale gentlemen standing about each"
2545,III,took one cat-like step towards Mr. Simmons and then stopped. As the
2546,III,money went into the carpet bag there came out a blue-barreled
2547,III,"six-shooter that now shone ominously in Mr. Simmons' hand, and they"
2548,III,looked into its barrel.
2549,III,
2550,III,Mr. Simmons gave one lightning glance to his rear and then backed
2551,III,towards the door.
2552,III,
2553,III,"""Don't make any mistake,"" he said. There was a blue gleam in his eyes"
2554,III,exactly the color of the shining metal of his weapon.
2555,III,
2556,III,"""Gentlemen,"" he said, ""I invite you all when in New York to call at my"

2560,III,the number. I generally make my traveling expenses as I go. Good

2562,III,
2563,III,Mr. Simmons backed quickly out and disappeared.

2579,III,in the depths of the gorge.
2580,III,
2581,III,"A young and stalwart man, clad in the garb of a chamois hunter, passed"
2582,III,"up the path. His face was bronzed with sun and wind, his eye was frank"
2583,III,"and clear, his step agile and firm. He was singing fragments of a"
2584,III,"Bavarian hunting song, and in his hand he held a white blossom of the"
2585,III,"edelweiss he had plucked from the cliff. Suddenly he paused, and the"
2586,III,"song broke, and dropped from his lips. A girl, costumed as the Swiss"
2587,III,"peasants are, crossed the path along one that bisected his, carrying a"
2588,III,small stone pitcher full of water. Her hair was of the lightest gold
2589,III,and hung far below her trim waist in a heavy braid. Her eyes shone
2590,III,"through the gathering twilight, and her lips, slightly parted, showed"
2591,III,a faint gleam of the whitest teeth.
2592,III,
2593,III,"As if impelled by a common impulse, the hunter and the maiden paused,"
2594,III,"each with their eyes fixed upon the other. Then the man advanced, and"
2595,III,"doffing his feathered hat, bowed low and spake some words in the"
2596,III,"German language. The maiden answered, speaking haltingly and low."
2597,III,
2598,III,"Then a door opened in a cottage almost hidden among the trees, and a"
2599,III,"babble of voices was heard. The maiden's cheeks turned crimson, and"
2600,III,"she started to go, but as she went, she turned her eyes and looked at"
2601,III,"the hunter still. He took a step after her, and stretched out his hand"
2602,III,as if to stay her. She tore a bunch of blue gentians from her bosom
2603,III,"and threw them towards him. He caught them as they fell, then ran"
2604,III,lightly and gave into her hand the edelweiss bloom that he carried.
2605,III,"She thrust it into her bosom, then ran like a mountain sprite into the"
2606,III,"cottage, where the voices were."
2607,III,
2608,III,"The hunter stopped for a while, then went his way more slowly up the"

2618,III,position at the top notch of society for his portion. The bride
2619,III,"brought a beauty that was flawless, and five million dollars. The"
2620,III,arrangement had been made in a businesslike manner. There had been no

2622,III,she had acquiesced listlessly. They had first met at a fashionable
2623,III,summer resort. The family of the Van Winklers and the money of the
2624,III,Vances were about to unite.
2625,III,
2626,III,The wedding was to be at high noon.
2627,III,
2628,III,Pelham Van Winkler had had a fire built in the ancient tiled fireplace
2629,III,"of one of his rooms, although the weather was warm. He sat on the edge"
2630,III,"of a writing table, and tossed handfuls of square-shaped letters, some"
2631,III,"tied with ribbons, into the fire. He smiled a little ironically as"
2632,III,"they flamed up, or as here and there among them he would find a"
2633,III,"withered flower, a scented glove or a lock of beribboned hair."
2634,III,

2637,III,
2638,III,"Van Winkler sighed, and the smile left his face. He recalled the"
2639,III,"twilight scene among the Alps mountains, where he was wandering with"
2640,III,"three or four companions on a summer tour, gay and careless, and"
2641,III,dressed in the picturesque garb of chamois hunters. He recalled the
2642,III,picture of a lovely peasant girl with eyes that held him with a charm
2643,III,"of power, crossing the mountain road, and pausing for a moment to toss"
2644,III,him the bunch of gentian flowers. Had he not been a Van Winkler and
2645,III,"owed a duty to the name, he would have sought her out and married her,"
2646,III,for her image had never left his eyes or his heart since that twilight
2647,III,"eve. But society and the family name claimed him, and today, at high"
2648,III,"noon, he was to marry Miss Vance, the daughter of the millionaire iron"
2649,III,founder.

2656,III,Miss Augusta Vance had flown from the irritating presence of fussy
2657,III,female friends and hysterical relatives to her boudoir for a few
2658,III,moments' quiet. She had no letters to burn; no past to bury. Her
2659,III,"mother was in an ecstasy of delight, for the family millions had"
2660,III,brought them places in the front row of Vanity Fair.
2661,III,
2662,III,Her marriage to Pelham Van Winkler was to be at high noon. Miss Vance
2663,III,fell suddenly into a dreamy reverie. She recalled a trip she had taken
2664,III,"with her family a year before, to Europe, and her mind dwelt"
2665,III,lingeringly upon a week they had spent among the foothills of the Alps
2666,III,in the cottage of a Swiss mountaineer. One evening at twilight she had
2667,III,gone with a pitcher across the road and filled it from a spring. She
2668,III,"had fancied to put on that day the peasant costume of Babette, the"
2669,III,"daughter of their host. It had become her well, with her long braid of"
2670,III,light-gold hair and blue eyes. A hunter had crossed the road as she
2671,III,"was returning--an Alpine chamois hunter, strong, stalwart, bronzed and"
2672,III,"free. She had looked up and caught his eyes, and his held hers. She"
2673,III,"went on, and still those magnetic eyes claimed her own. The door of"
2674,III,the cottage had opened and voices called. She started and obeyed the
2675,III,impulse to tear a bunch of gentians from her bosom and throw them to
2676,III,"him. He had caught them, and springing forward gave her an edelweiss"
2677,III,flower. Not since that evening had the image of that chamois hunter
2678,III,"left her. Surely fate had led him to her, and he seemed a man among"
2679,III,"men. But Miss Augusta Vance, with a dowry of five millions, could not"
2680,III,commit the folly of thinking of a common hunter of the Alps mountains.
2681,III,
2682,III,Miss Vance arose and opened a gold locket that lay upon her dressing
2683,III,case. She took from it a faded edelweiss flower and slowly crumpled it
2684,III,"to dust between her fingers. Then she rang for her maid, as the church"

2721,III,"Scarcely of a parsimonious nature, yet perforce of economic character,"
2722,III,the widow was compelled to resort to numerous expedients in order to
2723,III,prolong existence. She was the possessor of a bovine quadruped of most
2724,III,"excellent virtues. Her generous store of lacteal fluid, her amicable"
2725,III,"and pacific nature, and her gentleness of demeanor had endeared her to"

2813,III,The Pint Flask
2814,III,
2815,III,"A prominent Houston colonel, who is also a leading church member,"
2816,III,"started for church last Sunday morning with his family, as was his"
2817,III,"custom. He was serene and solid-looking, and his black frock coat and"
2818,III,light gray trousers fitted him snugly and stylishly. They passed along
2819,III,"Main Street on the way to church, and the colonel happened to think of"
2820,III,"a letter on his desk that he wanted, so he told his family to wait at"
2821,III,the door a moment while he stopped in his office to get it. He went in
2822,III,"and got the letter, and, to his surprise, there was a"
2823,III,disreputable-looking pint whisky flask with about an ounce of whisky
2824,III,left in it standing on his desk. The colonel abominates whisky and
2825,III,"never touches a drop of anything strong. He supposed that someone,"
2826,III,"knowing this, had passed his desk, and set the flask there by way of a"
2827,III,mild joke.
2828,III,
2829,III,"He looked about for a place to throw the bottle, but the back door was"
2830,III,"locked, and he tried unsuccessfully to raise the window that"
2831,III,"overlooked the alley. The colonel's wife, wondering why he was so long"
2832,III,"in coming, opened the door and surprised him, so that scarcely"
2833,III,thinking what he was doing he thrust the flask under his coat tail
2834,III,into his hip pocket.
2835,III,
2836,III,"""Why don't you come on?"" asked his wife. ""Didn't you find the letter?"""
2837,III,
2838,III,He couldn't do anything but go with her. He should have produced the
2839,III,"bottle right there, and explained the situation, but he neglected his"
2840,III,"opportunity. He went on down Main Street with his family, with the"
2841,III,pint flask feeling as big as a keg in his pocket. He was afraid some
2842,III,"of them would notice it bulging under his coat, so he lagged somewhat"
2843,III,in the rear. When he entered his pew at church and sat down there was
2844,III,"a sharp crack, and the odor of mean whisky began to work its way"
2845,III,around the church. The colonel saw several people elevate their noses
2846,III,"and look inquiringly around, and he turned as red as a beet. He heard"
2847,III,a female voice in the pew behind him whisper loudly:
2848,III,
2849,III,"""Old Colonel J is drunk again. They say he is hardly ever sober now,"
2850,III,"and some people say he beats his wife nearly every day."""
2851,III,
2852,III,The colonel recognized the voice of one of the most notorious female
2853,III,gossipers in Houston. He turned around and glared at her. She then
2854,III,whispered a little louder:
2855,III,
2856,III,"""Look at him. He really looks dangerous. And to come to church that"
2857,III,"way, too!"""

2860,III,
2861,III,The colonel knew that the bottle had cracked and he was afraid to
2862,III,"move, but a piece of it fell out on the floor. He usually knelt during"
2863,III,"prayer, but today he sat bolt upright on the seat. His wife noticed"
2864,III,his unusual behavior and whispered:
2865,III,
2866,III,"""James, you don't know how you pain me. You don't pray any more. I"
2867,III,knew what the result would be when I let you go to hear Ingersoll
2868,III,"lecture. You are an infidel. And--what is that I smell? Oh, James, you"
2869,III,"have been drinking, and on Sunday, too!"""
2870,III,
2871,III,"The colonel's wife put her handkerchief to her eyes, and he ground his"
2872,III,teeth in rage.
2873,III,
2874,III,"After the services were over, and they had reached home, his wife took"
2875,III,her seat on the back porch and began to cap some strawberries for
2876,III,dinner. This prevented his going out in the back yard and throwing the
2877,III,"bottle over the fence, as he had intended. His two little boys hung"
2878,III,"close around him, as they always did on Sunday, and he found it"
2879,III,impossible to get rid of it. He took them out for a stroll in the
2880,III,"front yard. Finally, he sent them both in the house on some pretext,"
2881,III,and drawing out the bottle hurled it into the street. The crack in it
2882,III,"had been only a slight one, and as it struck a soft heap of trash when"
2883,III,"it fell, it did not break."
2884,III,
2885,III,"The colonel felt immediately relieved, but just as the little boys ran"
2886,III,back he heard a voice in the street say:
2887,III,
2888,III,"""See here, sir, law's against throwing glass in the street. I saw you"
2889,III,"do it, but take it back, and it'll be all right this time."""
2890,III,
2891,III,The colonel turned and saw a big policeman handing the terrible bottle
2892,III,towards him over the fence. He took it and thrust it back into his
2893,III,pocket with a low but expressive remark. His little boys ran up and
2894,III,shouted:
2895,III,
2896,III,"""Oh, papa, what was that the policeman gave you? Let's see it!"""
2897,III,
2898,III,"They clutched at his coat tails, and grabbed for his pockets, and the"
2899,III,colonel backed against the fence.
2900,III,
2901,III,"""Go away from here, you little devils,"" he yelled. ""Go in the house or"

2906,III,The colonel went into the house and put on his hat. He resolved to get
2907,III,rid of the bottle if he had to walk a mile to do it.
2908,III,
2909,III,"""Where are you going?"" asked his wife in astonishment. ""Dinner is"
2910,III,"almost ready. Why don't you pull off your coat and cool off, James, as"
2911,III,"you usually do?"""
2912,III,
2913,III,"She gazed at him with the deepest suspicion, and that irritated him."
2914,III,
2915,III,"""Confound the dinner,"" he said, angrily. ""I'm hungry--no, I mean I'm"
2916,III,"sick; I don't want any dinner--I'm going to take a walk."""
2917,III,
2918,III,"""Papa, please show us what the policeman gave you,"" said one of his"
2919,III,little boys.
2920,III,
2921,III,"""Policeman!"" echoed the colonel's wife. ""Oh, James, to think that you"
2922,III,"would act this way! I know you haven't been drinking, but what is the"
2923,III,"matter with you? Come in and lie down. Let me pull off your coat."""
2924,III,
2925,III,"She tried to pull off the colonel's Prince Albert, as she generally"
2926,III,"did, but he got furiously angry and danced away from her."
2927,III,
2928,III,"""Take your hands off me, woman,"" he cried. ""I've got a headache, and"
2929,III,I'm going for a walk. I'll throw the blamed thing away if I have to go
2930,III,"to the North Pole to do it."""
2931,III,
2932,III,The colonel's wife shook her head as he went out the gate.
2933,III,
2934,III,"""He's working too hard,"" she said. ""Maybe a walk will do him good."""
2935,III,
2936,III,The colonel went down several blocks watching for an opportunity to
2937,III,"dispose of the flask. There were a good many people on the streets,"
2938,III,and there seemed to be always somebody looking at him.
2939,III,
2940,III,"Two or three of the colonel's friends met him, and stared at him"
2941,III,"curiously. His face was much flushed, his hat was on the back of his"
2942,III,head and there was a wild glare in his eyes. Some of them passed
2943,III,"without speaking, and the colonel laughed bitterly. He was getting"
2944,III,"desperate. Whenever he would get to a vacant lot, he would stop and"
2945,III,"gaze searchingly in every direction to see if the coast was clear, so"
2946,III,that he could pull out the flask and drop it. People began to watch
2947,III,"him from windows, and two or three little boys began to follow him."
2948,III,"The colonel turned around and spoke sharply to them, and they replied:"
2949,III,
2950,III,"""Look at the old guy with a jag on lookin' for a place to lie down."
2951,III,"W'y don't yer go to de calaboose and snooze it off, mister?"""
2952,III,
2953,III,* * * * *
2954,III,
2955,III,"The colonel finally dodged the boys, and his spirits rose as he saw"
2956,III,"before him a vacant square covered with weeds, in some places as high"
2957,III,as his head.
2958,III,
2959,III,Here was a place where he could get rid of the bottle. The minister of
2960,III,"his church lived on the opposite side of the vacant square, but the"
2961,III,weeds were so high that the house was completely hidden.
2962,III,
2963,III,"The colonel looked guiltily around and seeing no one, plunged into a"
2964,III,"path that led through the weeds. When he reached the center, where"
2965,III,"they were highest, he stopped and drew the whisky flask from his"
2966,III,"pocket. He looked at it a moment; smiled grimly, and said aloud:"
2967,III,
2968,III,"""Well, you've given me lots of trouble that nobody knows anything"
2969,III,"about but me."""
2970,III,
2971,III,"He was about to drop the flask when he heard a noise, and looking up"
2972,III,"he saw his minister standing in the path before him, gazing at him"
2973,III,with horrified eyes.
2974,III,
2975,III,"""My dear Colonel J----,"" said the good man. ""You distress me beyond"
2976,III,measure. I never knew that you drank. I am indeed deeply grieved to
2977,III,"see you here in this condition."""
2978,III,
2979,III,"The colonel was infuriated beyond control. ""Don't give a d--- if you"
2980,III,"are,"" he shouted. ""I'm drunk as a biled owl, and I don't care who"
2981,III,"knows it. I'm always drunk. I've drunk 15,000 gallons of whisky in the"
2982,III,last two weeks. I'm a bad man about this time every Sunday. Here goes
2983,III,"the bottle once more for luck."""
2984,III,
2985,III,He hurled the flask at the minister and it struck him on the ear and
2986,III,broke into twenty pieces. The minister let out a yell and turned and
2987,III,ran back to his house.
2988,III,
2989,III,"The colonel gathered a pile of stones and hid among the tall weeds,"
2990,III,resolved to fight the whole town as long as his ammunition held out.
2991,III,His hard luck had made him desperate. An hour later three mounted
2992,III,"policemen got into the weeds, and the colonel surrendered. He had"
2993,III,"cooled off by that time enough to explain matters, and as he was well"
2994,III,"known to be a perfectly sober and temperate citizen, he was allowed to"
2995,III,go home.

3003,III,An Odd Character
3004,III,
3005,III,A Post Reporter stood on the San Jacinto Street bridge last night.
3006,III,Half of a May moon swam in a sea of buttermilky clouds high in the
3007,III,"east. Below, the bayou gleamed dully in the semi-darkness, merging"
3008,III,into inky blackness farther down. A steam tug glided noiselessly down
3009,III,"the sluggish waters, leaving a shattered trail of molten silver. Foot"
3010,III,passengers across the bridge were scarce. A few belated Fifth-Warders
3011,III,"straggled past, clattering along the uneven planks of the footway. The"
3012,III,reporter took off his hat and allowed a cool breath of a great city to
3013,III,"fan his brow. A mellow voice, with, however, too much dramatic"
3014,III,"inflection, murmured at his elbow, and quoted incorrectly from Byron:"
3015,III,
3016,III,"""Oh, moon, and darkening river, ye are wondrous strong;"
3017,III,Yet lovely in your strength as is the light of a dark eye
3018,III,"in woman."""
3019,III,
3020,III,The reporter turned and saw a magnificent specimen of the genus tramp.
3021,III,"He was attired in a garb to be viewed with wonder, and even awe. His"
3022,III,"coat was a black frock, fallen into decay some years ago. Under it he"
3023,III,"wore a jaunty striped blazer, too tight to button, and the ghost of a"
3024,III,"collar peered above its intricacies. His trousers were patched, and"
3025,III,"torn, and frayed, and faded away at the bottom into ghostly,"
3026,III,indescribable feet shod in shapeless leather and dust.
3027,III,
3028,III,"His face, however, was the face of a hilarious faun. His eyes were"
3029,III,"brilliant and piercing, and a godlike smile lit up a face that owed"
3030,III,little to art or soap.
3031,III,
3032,III,"His nose was classic, and his nostrils thin and nervous, betokening"
3033,III,"either race or fever. His brow was high and smooth, and his regard"
3034,III,"lofty and superior, though a bristly beard of uncertain cut and grisly"
3035,III,effect covered the lower part of his countenance.
3036,III,
3037,III,"""Do you know what I am, sir?"" asked this strange being. The reporter"
3038,III,gazed at his weird form and shook his head.
3039,III,
3040,III,"""Your reply reassures me,"" said the wanderer. ""It convinces me that I"
3041,III,have not made a mistake in addressing you. You have some of the
3042,III,"instincts of a gentleman, because you forbore to say what you know"
3043,III,"well, namely, that I am a tramp. I look like a tramp and I am one, but"
3044,III,"no ordinary one. I have a university education, I am a Greek and Latin"
3045,III,"scholar, and I have held the chair of English literature in a college"
3046,III,"known all over the world. I am a biologist, and more than all, I am a"
3047,III,"student of the wonderful book, man. The last accomplishment is the"
3048,III,"only one I still practice. If I am not grown unskilled, I can read"
3049,III,"you."""
3050,III,
3051,III,He bent a discriminating look upon the reporter. The reporter puffed
3052,III,at his cigar and submitted to the scrutiny.
3053,III,
3054,III,"""You are a newspaper man,"" said the tramp. ""I will tell you how I"
3055,III,reached the conclusion. I have been watching you for ten minutes. I
3056,III,"knew you were not a man of leisure, for you walked upon the bridge"
3057,III,with a somewhat rapid step. You stopped and began to watch the effect
3058,III,of the moon upon the water. A business man would have been hurrying
3059,III,along to supper. When you got your cigar out you had to feel in three
3060,III,or four pockets before you found one. A newspaper man has many cigars
3061,III,"forced upon him in the course of a day, and he has to distribute them"
3062,III,"among several pockets. Again, you have no pencil sticking out of your"
3063,III,"pocket. No newspaper man ever has. Am I right in my conjecture?"""
3064,III,
3065,III,The reporter made a shrewd guess.
3066,III,
3067,III,"""You are right,"" he said, ""and your having seen me going into a"
3068,III,newspaper office some time ago no doubt assisted you in your
3069,III,"diagnosis."""
3070,III,
3071,III,The tramp laughed.
3072,III,

3076,III,"have spoken of myself. You have not offered me money, and by that have"
3077,III,"won my esteem. I am a tramp, but I never accept money from anyone. Why"
3078,III,should I? The richest man in your town is a pauper compared with me. I
3079,III,"see you smile. Come, sir, indulge me for a while. I am afflicted at"
3080,III,"times with _cacoethes loquendi_, and rarely do I meet a gentleman who"
3081,III,"will give me an ear."""
3082,III,
3083,III,"The Post Man had seen so many people with the corners rubbed off, so"
3084,III,"many men who always say and do what they are expected to, that he fell"
3085,III,into the humor of listening to this man who said unexpected things.
3086,III,And then he was so strange to look upon.
3087,III,
3088,III,"The tramp was not drunk, and his appearance was not that of a drinking"

3119,III,
3120,III,"He held his empty hand with a gesture toward the reporter, who"
3121,III,pretended to accept its visionary contents.
3122,III,
3123,III,The tramp took off his hat and let the breeze sift through his tangled
3124,III,hair.

3165,III,A Houston Romance
3166,III,
3167,III,About two years ago one of the most popular young society men in
3168,III,Houston mysteriously disappeared. He had been the glass of fashion and
3169,III,the mold of form of the Magnolia City for several years. Especially
3170,III,"was he noted for his exquisite and fashionable dress, and he was"
3171,III,regarded as the leader in bringing out the latest and correct styles
3172,III,of clothing. No one in Houston ever saw a wrinkle in his elegantly
3173,III,"fitting clothes, or a spot upon his snowy linen. He possessed"
3174,III,sufficient means to enable him to devote his whole time to society and
3175,III,"the art of dress, and in his whole bearing and manners was well nigh"
3176,III,equal to the famous Beau Brummel.
3177,III,
3178,III,About a year ago it was noticed that he was beginning to grow
3179,III,preoccupied and reserved. His gay and gallant manner was as
3180,III,"Chesterfieldian as ever, but he was becoming more silent and moody,"
3181,III,"and there seemed to be something weighing upon his mind. Suddenly,"
3182,III,"without a word of farewell, he disappeared, and no traces of him could"
3183,III,"be discovered. He left a good balance in the bank to his credit, and"
3184,III,society racked its brains to conjecture some reason for his mysterious
3185,III,"disappearance. He had no relatives in Houston, and with proverbial"
3186,III,fickleness his acquaintances and butterfly friends soon allowed him to
3187,III,pass from their minds.
3188,III,
3189,III,The mystery has at length been cleared up. A young Houston merchant
3190,III,who was an intimate associate with the young society man took a trip
3191,III,to Europe in September.
3192,III,
3193,III,While in Italy he had a desire to visit one of the old monasteries
3194,III,"among the Alps; so one day he ascended the Passo di San Giacomo, a"
3195,III,road little wider than a bridle path that led up for 7000 feet among
3196,III,"the glaciers of the Leopontine Alps. Far up, perched upon a"
3197,III,"snow-covered crag, he could see the monastery of the Franciscan"
3198,III,monks--the Minorite Friars of the Cismontana group of the Franciscans.
3199,III,
3200,III,"He picked his cautious way up the narrow way, pausing now and then to"
3201,III,"admire the rainbow hues that flashed from frozen glaciers, or the vast"
3202,III,drifts of snow packed among the crevasses high above his head.
3203,III,
3204,III,After six hours' arduous toil he stood before the massive iron gates
3205,III,"of the monastery. He rang the bell, and a grim warden bade him enter"
3206,III,and partake of the hospitality of the brothers. He was ushered into a
3207,III,"vast dim hall, with walls and floors of cold gray stone. The monk who"
3208,III,"admitted him bade him wait, as the brothers were about to pass through"
3209,III,on their way to their cells from evening prayer. A deep-toned bell
3210,III,"clanged once; a great door softly opened, and a procession of shaved"
3211,III,"monks filed slowly and noiselessly past. Theirs heads were bowed and,"
3212,III,"as they told their beads, their lips moved in silent prayer."
3213,III,
3214,III,As they came past the visitor he was astounded to see among the devout
3215,III,monks the form of the man who had once been the curled darling and
3216,III,pattern of elegance in Houston.
3217,III,
3218,III,* * * * *
3219,III,
3220,III,"He called his name and the monk, startled by his voice, raised his"
3221,III,head and stepped from the ranks of his brother penitents. The others
3222,III,continued their silent march until another great door had closed
3223,III,behind them.
3224,III,
3225,III,The Houston man gazed at the friar in wonder.
3226,III,
3227,III,"He wore a long black robe, slightly confined at the waist by a hempen"
3228,III,"cord, that hung to his feet in classic, shapely folds. The crown of"
3229,III,his head was shaven and his face was as smooth as a maiden's. But the
3230,III,most noticeable thing was the expression of absolute peace and serene
3231,III,happiness that shone from his features. There was no trace of the
3232,III,worried and absent look that his friends had noticed before he
3233,III,disappeared.
3234,III,
3235,III,A calm and holy beatitude beamed from his face like a benison.
3236,III,
3237,III,"""In heaven's name,"" said his friend, ""what brought you here to bury"
3238,III,yourself forever from the world; why did you leave your friends and
3239,III,"pleasures to pass your days in this dreary place?"""
3240,III,
3241,III,"""Listen,"" said the monk, ""and I will tell you. I am now supremely and"
3242,III,ecstatically happy. I have attained the goal of my desires. Look at
3243,III,"this robe."" He glanced proudly at the dark, severe robe that swept"
3244,III,downward from his waist in graceful folds.
3245,III,
3246,III,"""I am one man,"" he continued, ""who has arrived at the fruition of his"
3247,III,dearest earthly hopes. I have got something on at least that will not
3248,III,"bag at the knees."""

3266,III,A few days ago a _Hoodoo Jane_ went down the bayou to the battle
3267,III,ground with the intention of gathering from some of the old
3268,III,inhabitants a few of the stories and legends that are so plentiful
3269,III,concerning the events that occurred on that memorable spot.
3270,III,
3271,III,"The _Hoodoo Jane_ let the reporter off at the battle ground, which is"

3274,III,battle is said to have raged. Down under a little bunch of elm trees
3275,III,"was a little cabin, and the reporter wandered thither in the hope of"

3408,III,"The Post Man also entered, and sipping a glass of water, which he"

3485,III,"references they sent me, sized up the bids and selected my force. I"
3486,III,"ordered them to report on a certain day, and they were on time, eager"
3487,III,to go to work. I got $50 per week from my editorial writer; $40 from
3488,III,my city editor; $25 each from three reporters; $20 from a dramatic
3489,III,"critic; $35 from a literary editor, and $30 each from night and"
3490,III,"telegraph editors. I also accepted three special writers, who paid me"
3491,III,$15 per week each for doing special assignments. I was managing editor
3492,III,"and was to direct, criticize and instruct the staff."
3493,III,
3494,III,* * * * *
3495,III,
3496,III,"""I discharged the old force, and after an hour's course of instruction"
3497,III,I turned my new staff loose upon their duties. Most of them had
3498,III,"graduated with high honors at college and were of wealthy families,"
3499,III,who could afford to pay well for the splendid advantage of entering
3500,III,them in Binkley's Practical School of Journalism.
3501,III,
3502,III,"""When the staff dispersed, eager and anxious, to their several duties,"
3503,III,I leaned back in my revolving chair with a smile of satisfaction. Here
3504,III,"was an income of $1,400 per month coming from and not paid to my"
3505,III,"staff, besides the $3,000 yearly profit from the paper. Oh, it was a"
3506,III,good thing.
3507,III,
3508,III,"""Of course, I expected a little crudeness and stiffness about the work"
3509,III,"of my staff at first, but I calculated that they would err on the side"
3510,III,of fine writing rather than otherwise. I lit a cigar and strolled
3511,III,through the editorial rooms. The leader writer was at his desk working
3512,III,"away, his high, intellectual forehead and broadcloth clothes"
3513,III,presenting a fine appearance. The literary editor was consulting an
3514,III,"encyclopedia with a knitted brow, and the dramatic critic was pasting"
3515,III,a picture of Shakespeare above his desk. The city force were out news
3516,III,gathering.
3517,III,
3518,III,"""I began to feel sorry for people who were unable to think up such a"
3519,III,fine scheme as I had. Everything was working as smooth as you please.
3520,III,"I went downstairs and, rendered reckless by success, I hunted up an"
3521,III,"old friend and confided to him my wonderful scheme. He was impressed,"
3522,III,and we hied ourselves to a caravansary and opened bottle after bottle
3523,III,in honor of the idea.
3524,III,
3525,III,"""When I returned to the office, the entire staff was there with their"
3526,III,day's work turned in. The truth is I was so exhilarated by what I had
3527,III,taken that I hardly knew what I was reading when I looked over their
3528,III,"copy, but with a mistaken confidence in the ability of my scholars, I"
3529,III,"let the stuff all go on the file, and shortly afterward the foreman"
3530,III,carried it away. I instructed the night editor as to his duties and
3531,III,"went home, to dream of my good fortune."
3532,III,
3533,III,"""The next morning I came down town about 9 o'clock, and it seemed to"
3534,III,"me I couldn't see anything but newsboys. The town was full of them,"
3535,III,and people were buying my paper as fast as the boys could hand them
3536,III,out. I fairly swelled with satisfaction and pride. As I neared the
3537,III,office I saw five men with shotguns standing on the sidewalk.
3538,III,
3539,III,"""One of them caught sight of me, and took a snap shot at me as I"
3540,III,turned the corner. A buckshot went through my ear and several through
3541,III,"my hat. I didn't wait for explanation, as the other four men also"
3542,III,"tried to get a shot at me, and I cut around the corner and dodged into"
3543,III,a back lot full of empty dry goods boxes.
3544,III,
3545,III,"""A newsboy went by, calling the paper, and I whistled him up to a"
3546,III,crack in the fence and bought one. I thought perhaps there might be
3547,III,something in the paper that had offended somebody.
3548,III,
3549,III,"""I crawled into a big box and opened the paper. The more I read the"
3550,III,"wilder I became. Excuse me for changing the subject,"" continued the"
3551,III,"ragged man, ""but you said something a while ago in reference to this"
3552,III,"liquid refreshment, which I perceive is already finished."""
3553,III,
3554,III,"The Post Man stammered, hesitated, felt in his vest pocket once more"
3555,III,"and then arose, and taking the saloon man aside, whispered with him"
3556,III,for about fifteen minutes. The result was that the saloon man brought
3557,III,"another bottle of wine, but with a very bad grace, slamming the bottle"
3558,III,and glasses upon the table in an ill-bred and ungracious manner. The
3559,III,"ragged man smiled, filled the glasses, and then, his face taking on a"
3560,III,"deep frown as his mind reverted to his story, he continued."
3561,III,
3562,III,"""I turned first to the local page. The first item that met my eyes was"
3563,III,this:
3564,III,
3565,III,"""'Colonel J. Henry Gwinn, the administrator of the Perkins"
3566,III,"estate, has robbed the family of the deceased of over"
3567,III,"$75,000. The heirs will bring suit for that amount at an"
3568,III,early date.'
3569,III,
3570,III,"""I remembered that the man who fired at me looked a good deal like"

3574,III,"1204 West Thirty-Second Street, has recently built a"
3575,III,"$10,000 residence. Votes in the city council must be"
3576,III,getting higher.'
3577,III,
3578,III,"""There were about fifteen items of the same kind and every one of them"
3579,III,was a dead shot for big damages. I glanced at the society columns and
3580,III,saw a few harmless little squibs like the following:
3581,III,
3582,III,'Mrs. General Crowder gave a big ball last night on
3583,III,Johnson Avenue. It does seem like she would get a divorce
3584,III,from that ticket agent in Kansas City before she tried to

3589,III,"""'The Ladies' Histrionic Society met last evening over"
3590,III,Klein's music store. Miss Sadie Dodson was overcome by the
3591,III,heat and was taken home in a hack. Heat! That's a new name
3592,III,for it.'
3593,III,
3594,III,"""These are some of the least objectionable items. There were some that"
3595,III,made my hair rise slowly on my head as I read them.
3596,III,
3597,III,"""Mechanically I turned to the editorial page, thinking it hardly"
3598,III,possible there could be anything wrong with it. The first article
3599,III,"charged every city and county official with corruption in office,"
3600,III,"calling them by name, and wound up by offering to give $10,000 to any"
3601,III,charity fund if the paper did not prove every charge within ten days.
3602,III,
3603,III,"""I crept through the lot, knocked a board off the next fence and made"
3604,III,my way to the back stairway of the office. I found two of my reporters
3605,III,cursing and kicking in the back yard. One of them was in a heap of
3606,III,soft coal dust and the other was hanging by his coat tail on a picket
3607,III,fence. Somebody had thrown them out the window.
3608,III,
3609,III,"""Sick at heart I crept upstairs to the editorial rooms. There was"
3610,III,considerable noise going on. I went in easy as I could and looked
3611,III,around. My $50 editorial writer was in a corner with half a chair in
3612,III,his hands defending himself manfully against a quorum of the city
3613,III,council. He had laid out three of them and was putting up a great
3614,III,fight. The city editor was lying on the floor with four men sitting on
3615,III,"him, and a large, angry German was trying to punch the dramatic editor"
3616,III,off the top of the book case with a piece of gas pipe.
3617,III,
3618,III,"""It is enough to discourage any man to have a staff that is paying him"
3619,III,"$1,400 per month treated that way."
3620,III,
3621,III,"""I went into my private office, and the enraged public followed me"
3622,III,"there. I knew it was no use to argue with them, so I pulled out my"
3623,III,checkbook and tried to compromise. When all the money I had in the
3624,III,"bank was exhausted, and another batch of infuriated citizens came in,"
3625,III,I gave up in despair.
3626,III,
3627,III,"""At 11 o'clock the business office force came up in a body and"
3628,III,resigned. At 12 o'clock damage suits were filed against the paper to
3629,III,"the amount of $200,000, and I knew every one of them was good for a"
3630,III,judgment. I went downstairs and got about nine drinks and came back. I
3631,III,"met the editorial writer on the stairs, and I hit him on the point of"
3632,III,the chin without saying a word. He still held one leg of the chair in
3633,III,"his hand, and he swiped me over the head with it and ran. When I got"
3634,III,inside I found that the dramatic critic was about to win the day. He
3635,III,was a college man and a great football player. He had thrashed the big
3636,III,"German and had pulled the four citizens off the city editor, and they"
3637,III,were waging great battle with the foe. Just then the society editor
3638,III,"dashed into the room barefooted, in his shirt and trousers, and I"
3639,III,"heard a tremendous screeching and chattering, as if a thousand parrots"
3640,III,were talking at once.

3676,III,There is a Houston man who is a great lover of science and an ardent
3677,III,student of her mysteries. He has a small laboratory fitted up at home
3678,III,and spends a great deal of his time in experimenting with chemicals
3679,III,and analyzing different substances.
3680,III,
3681,III,"Of late he has been much interested in various germ theories, and has"
3682,III,"somewhat neglected his business to read Pasteur's and Koch's writings,"
3683,III,and everything he could procure relating to sundry kinds of bacilli.
3684,III,
3685,III,"He has bought a new 900-power magnifying instrument, and hopes before"
3686,III,long to add his quota to the number of valuable discoveries concerning

3689,III,Last Tuesday night there was a sociable and supper given at one of the
3690,III,churches.
3691,III,
3692,III,"The man's wife wanted him to go, but he begged off, saying that he"
3693,III,would much rather stay at home and have a good quiet time with his
3694,III,"microscope, while she went and took the children."
3695,III,
3696,III,He had been reading ex-State Geologist Dumble's report of his analysis
3697,III,"of Houston bayou water, and he was anxious to verify that gentleman's"
3698,III,statements by an examination of his own.
3699,III,
3700,III,"So, immediately after supper he went through the kitchen and found a"
3701,III,tin bucket full of water sitting on a bench by the hydrant and carried
3702,III,"it at once to his laboratory and, fastening himself in, went to work."
3703,III,
3704,III,After a time he heard his wife and children leave the house on their
3705,III,"way to the supper at the church, which was only a block or two away,"
3706,III,and he congratulated himself on the nice quiet time he was going to
3707,III,have.
3708,III,
3709,III,"He worked away for nearly three hours, repeatedly examining through"
3710,III,the powerful microscope samples of the bayou water from the bucket.

3713,III,
3714,III,At last he slapped his hand on his knee in triumph.

3716,III,"""Dumble's wrong!"" he exclaimed. ""He says it's the _hybadid cystallis_,"
3717,III,and I'm certain he's mistaken. The inhabitants of this water are
3718,III,"schizomycetic bacteria, but they are neither macrocci of"

3723,III,
3724,III,He seized his pen and began to write. In a little while his family
3725,III,came home and his wife came up to the laboratory. He generally refused

3727,III,her enthusiastically.

3729,III,"""Ellen,"" he cried, ""since you have been gone I have won fame and"

3780,III,Cyrus and I had been engaged to be married for fifteen years. He was
3781,III,professor of chemistry in the Massachusetts State University. I had
3782,III,received an offer of $40 a month to teach a private school in a little
3783,III,"town in Texas, and had accepted it. Cyrus received $20 per month from"
3784,III,his chair in the university. He had waited for fifteen years for me to
3785,III,save up enough money for us to get married. I seized this chance in
3786,III,"Texas, resolved to live economically, and in fifteen more years, if I"
3787,III,"kept the school that long, we could marry."

3847,III,I went in the parlor and looked about me in amazement. The room was

3849,III,carelessness visible everywhere. A wheelbarrow full of dried mortar
3850,III,stood in one corner that had been left there when the masons built the
3851,III,house. Five or six chickens were roosting on the piano and a pair of
3852,III,pants were hanging on the chandelier.
3853,III,
3854,III,"Mrs. DeVere had a pale, aristocratic face, with Grecian features, and"
3855,III,snowy hair arranged carefully in becoming ringlets. She was dressed in
3856,III,black satin and wore flashing diamonds on her hands and at her throat.
3857,III,Her eyes were black and piercing and her eyebrows dark. As I took my

3882,III,stream of tobacco juice.

3884,III,"On his head was an enormous Mexican sombrero. He wore no shirt, but"

3899,III,"""I know your countrymen,"" he said with a dark frown upon his handsome"

3901,III,"and prejudice. What do you think of Jefferson Davis?"""
3902,III,
3903,III,I looked into his flashing eye without flinching.
3904,III,
3905,III,"""He was a traitor,"" I said."
3906,III,
3907,III,"Mr. DeVere laughed musically, and stooping down drew a pine splinter"
3908,III,from one of his toes. Then he approached his mother and saluted her
3909,III,with that chivalrous reverence and courtesy that still lingers among
3910,III,sons of the South.

3912,III,"""What shall we have for supper, mammy?"" he said."

3917,III,roosted upon the piano. He wrung its neck and threw its quivering and
3918,III,fluttering body upon the delicate Brussels carpet. He took a long
3919,III,"stride and stood before me, towering like an avenging god, with one"
3920,III,"arm upraised, the other pointing to the fowl, struggling in its death"
3921,III,agonies.
3922,III,
3923,III,"""That is the South,"" he cried, in a voice of thunder; ""the bleeding"
3924,III,and dying South after Gettysburg. Tonight you will feast upon its

3929,III,and then dropped on one knee and bowed his kingly head.

3940,III,Aubrey DeVere sat at the foot of the table and carved. He had taken
3941,III,"off his coat, and his clinging undershirt revealed every muscle of a"
3942,III,torso as grand as that of the Dying Gladiator in the Vatican at Rome.
3943,III,The supper was truly a Southern one. At one end was an enormous
3944,III,"grinning opossum and sweet potatoes, while the table was covered with"
3945,III,"dishes of cabbage, fried chicken, fruit cake, persimmons, hot raw"
3946,III,"biscuits, blackhaws, Maypops, fried catfish, maple syrup, hominy, ice"

3952,III,"like a tiger, Aubrey DeVere sprang to his feet and hurled his carving"
3953,III,knife to the handle in Pete's breast. The poor colored man fell to the
3954,III,"floor, and I ran and lifted his head."
3955,III,

3973,III,"The next day I met the four DeVere children, and found them very"
3974,III,"bright and lovable. Two were boys and two girls, ranging from 10 to 16"
3975,III,years of age. The little school house was half a mile away down a
3976,III,"beautiful country lane, full of grass and flowers. I had fifteen"
3977,III,"scholars in my school, and except for a few things my life at Vereton"
3978,III,would have been like Paradise. The first month I saved up $42. My
3979,III,"salary was $40, and I made the other two by loaning small sums to my"
3980,III,"scholars for a few days at a time, for which they paid me from 10 to"
3981,III,25 cents interest.
3982,III,
3983,III,I took a curious interest in studying the character of Aubrey DeVere.
3984,III,"His was one of the noblest and grandest natures I had ever known, but"
3985,III,it was so far influenced by the traditions and customs of the people
3986,III,"with whom he had lived, that scarcely a vestige of its natural good"
3987,III,remained.
3988,III,
3989,III,"He had been splendidly educated at the University of Virginia, and was"
3990,III,"an accomplished orator, musician and painter, but from his early"
3991,III,"childhood he had been allowed to give way to every impulse and desire,"
3992,III,and his manhood showed sadly his lack of self-control.
3993,III,
3994,III,One evening I was in the music room in the second story of the DeVere
3995,III,"mansion, playing over that loveliest of Schubert's Leider, ""Hark,"
3996,III,"Hark, the Lark,"" when Aubrey DeVere entered. Of late, on account of"
3997,III,"some strange whim, he had become more careful in his dress."
3998,III,
3999,III,"This evening he wore a shirt, thrown open in front, exhibiting his"
4000,III,"massive collar bone, and a black velvet smoking jacket, trimmed with"
4001,III,"gold braid in a fanciful design. On his hands were white kid gloves,"
4002,III,"and I noticed that his feet, on which he absolutely refused to wear"
4003,III,"shoes, had been recently washed at the pump. He was in one of his most"
4004,III,"bitter and sneering moods, and launched forth into a most acrimonious"
4005,III,"tirade against Grant, Lincoln, George Francis Train and other heroes"
4006,III,of the Union. He sat down upon the center table and began scratching
4007,III,one of his ankles with the toe of the other foot in a manner that he
4008,III,knew always irritated me.
4009,III,
4010,III,"Resolved not to become angry, I continued playing. Suddenly he said:"
4011,III,
4012,III,"""Pardon me, Miss Cook, but you struck a wrong note in effecting the"
4013,III,"run in that diminished seventh."""
4014,III,
4015,III,"""I think not,"" I answered."

4017,III,"""You are a liar!"" he replied. ""You struck a natural, when it should"
4018,III,"have been a sharp. This is the note you should have played."""
4019,III,
4020,III,I heard something swish through the air. From where he sat on the
4021,III,"center table, he shot between his teeth a solid stream of tobacco"
4022,III,juice with deadly aim full upon the black key of A-sharp on the piano.
4023,III,"I rose from the stool, somewhat nettled, but smiling."
4024,III,
4025,III,"""You are offended,"" he said, sarcastically. ""You do not like our"
4026,III,Southern ways. You think me a mauvais sujet. You think we lack aplomb
4027,III,"and savoir-vivre. With your Boston culture, you think you can detect a"
4028,III,"false note in our courtesy, a certain lack of fineness and refinement"
4029,III,"in our manners. Do not deny it."""
4030,III,
4031,III,"""Mr. DeVere,"" I said coldly, ""your taunts are nothing to me. I am here"
4032,III,to do my duty. In your own house you are at liberty to act as you
4033,III,"choose. Will you move one of your feet and allow me to pass?"""
4034,III,
4035,III,Mr. DeVere suddenly sprang from the table and clasped me fiercely in
4036,III,his arms.
4037,III,
4038,III,"""Penelope,"" he cried, in a terrible voice. ""I love you! You miserable"
4039,III,"little dried-up, washed-out, white-eyed, sallow-cheeked, prim, angular"
4040,III,Yankee schoolma'am. I loved you from the moment I laid eyes on you.
4041,III,"Will you marry me?"""
4042,III,
4043,III,I struggled to get free.

4045,III,"""Put me down,"" I cried. ""Oh, if Cyrus were only here!"""
4046,III,
4047,III,"""Cyrus!"" shouted Mr. DeVere. ""Who is Cyrus? Cyrus shall never have"
4048,III,"you, I swear."""
4049,III,
4050,III,He raised me above his head with one hand and hurled me through the
4051,III,plate glass window into the yard below. Then he threw the furniture
4052,III,"down upon me, piece by piece, the piano last of all. I then heard him"
4053,III,"rush down the stairs, and in a moment felt a stream of liquid"
4054,III,trickling down among the broken furniture. I recognized the acrid
4055,III,"smell of petroleum, heard the scratch of a match, and the fierce"
4056,III,"roaring of flames; felt a sudden scorching heat, and remembered no"
4057,III,more.

4063,III,
4064,III,"I tried to rise, but was too weak."
4065,III,
4066,III,"""You must keep still,"" said Mrs. DeVere gently. ""You have been ill"
4067,III,with fever for two weeks. You must excuse my son; I am afraid he
4068,III,"startled you. He loves you very much, but he is so impulsive."""
4069,III,
4070,III,"""Where is he?"" I asked."
4071,III,
4072,III,"""He has gone to bring Cyrus, and it is time he had returned."""
4073,III,
4074,III,"""How did I escape from that dreadful fire?"""
4075,III,
4076,III,"""Aubrey rescued you. After his fit of passion had passed he dashed"
4077,III,"aside the burning furniture and carried you back upstairs."""
4078,III,
4079,III,"A few minutes later I heard the sound of footsteps, and looking up saw"
4080,III,Aubrey DeVere and Cyrus Potts standing by my bedside.
4081,III,
4082,III,"""Cyrus,"" I cried."
4083,III,
4084,III,"""How de do, Penelope,"" said Cyrus."
4085,III,
4086,III,Before I could reply there was a loud and fiendish yell outside. The
4087,III,front door was broken down and a dozen masked men dashed into the
4088,III,room.
4089,III,
4090,III,"""We hear there is a d--- Yankee in here,"" they cried. ""Lynch him!"""
4091,III,
4092,III,Aubrey DeVere seized a table by the leg and killed every man of the
4093,III,lynching party.

4100,III,A week later Cyrus and I left for Boston. His salary has been raised
4101,III,to $25 per month and I had saved $210.
4102,III,
4103,III,Aubrey DeVere accompanied us to the train. Under his arm he carried a
4104,III,keg of blasting powder. As our train rolled out he sat down upon this
4105,III,keg and touched a lighted match to it.

4123,III,would take a man to save enough beer money to build Solomon's temple.
4124,III,"While he was musing, a small, slender policeman with a fiery eye came"

4126,III,himself.

4170,III,"gale, and the snow clouds sweeping southward suffer a splendent"
4171,III,blue-tinged star to turn a radiant eye downward upon the world.
4172,III,
4173,III,Through a rift in the roof of the attic the star alone sees what
4174,III,transpires there that night. On the bare floor stands some rickety
4175,III,"furniture, and in the center is a table on which lie paper, pens and"

4215,III,Suddenly the sharp whip of the present cracks in his ear and the cold
4216,III,"strikes to his marrow and rouses him to action. He rises, dons a"

4218,III,"stairs. He returns directly with bread and cheese, wrapped in an old"
4219,III,"newspaper. He sits again, gulping down the food, which tastes like"

4282,III,"wander arm in arm over to the Gesundheit Bier Garten, and while the"
4283,III,string band in the pavilion played the dear old Fatherland melodies
4284,III,they would sit at a little round table in some dark corner and click
4285,III,glasses in the most friendly and lover-like manner. The marriage was
4286,III,"to come off in June, and Kathleen, after the custom of her people, had"
4287,III,already prepared her bridal trousseau and housekeeping effects. In her
4288,III,wardrobe were great piles of beautifully embroidered things in fine
4289,III,"linen and damask; heaps of table cloths, napkins and towels, and in"
4290,III,"the big drawers of her bureau were piles of dainty, lace-trimmed"
4291,III,"garments that Kathleen, being a modest Irish maiden and not a New York"
4292,III,"millionairess, kept shyly hidden from view, instead of having their"
4293,III,description printed in the _Post_. Kathleen had made these garments
4294,III,"herself, working with loving care and patience, and they were intended"
4295,III,"as a guarantee of good faith, and not for publication. The girls in"
4296,III,"the neighborhood all envied Kathleen her good luck, for Fergus was a"
4297,III,"fine-looking young man, and his business was prospering. He could"
4298,III,"drink more whiskey, tell funnier jokes and sing ""The Wearin' of the"
4299,III,"Green"" so you could hear it farther on a still night than could any"
4300,III,other young man of their acquaintance.
4301,III,
4302,III,"So, dark-haired Kathleen was happy, bending over her work with rosy"
4303,III,"cheeks and smiling lips, while, alas! already the serpent was at work"
4304,III,that was to enter her Eden.
4305,III,
4306,III,* * * * *
4307,III,
4308,III,"One day Kathleen was sitting at her window, half hidden by the"
4309,III,"climbing honeysuckle vines, when she saw Fergus pass down the street"
4310,III,"with another man, a low-browed, treacherous-looking person, with"
4311,III,shifty eyes and a snakelike manner.
4312,III,
4313,III,It was with a deep foreboding and a strange sinking of the heart that
4314,III,she recognized Fergus' companion as a notorious member of the Young
4315,III,Men's Christian Association of Houston. From that moment Kathleen's
4316,III,peace of mind fled. When Fergus came to see her that night he seemed
4317,III,abstracted and different. His hand trembled when he took the glass of
4318,III,"rye she handed him, and when he sang for her"
4319,III,
4320,III,"""Let the huntsman graze his hounds As the farmer does his"
4321,III,"grounds,"""
4322,III,
4323,III,that sad and melancholy old song that Irishmen always sing when they
4324,III,"feel particularly jolly, his voice sounded plaintive and full of"
4325,III,pathos.
4326,III,
4327,III,Kathleen was far too wise to chide him. She tried to be gay and
4328,III,"cheerful, though the change in Fergus made her heart very sad. Again"
4329,III,"the next day, and once more the following day but one, did she see him"
4330,III,with the low-browed tempter that had wrought the change.
4331,III,
4332,III,Day by day Fergus grew morose and pale. His once jolly and laughing
4333,III,"face grew stern and thoughtful. He rarely spoke to anyone, and once"
4334,III,when Mr. O'Malley handed him a big schooner from a keg fresh from the
4335,III,"brewery, he heaved such a deep and mournful sigh that the foam flew"
4336,III,half across the room.
4337,III,
4338,III,"""Kathleen,"" said her papa one day, ""what's the matter wid that"
4339,III,long-legged omadhaun Fergus? He looks like he was walking over his own
4340,III,"grave."""
4341,III,
4342,III,"""Oh, papa,"" said Kathleen, bursting into tears, ""I do not know, he"
4343,III,"seems to be full of bayou water."""
4344,III,
4345,III,"Let us follow Fergus and the sinister stranger, and see what spell is"
4346,III,upon our hero.

4349,III,
4350,III,William K. Meeks was a member of the notorious Young Men's Christian
4351,III,Association. His parents were honest and reputable citizens of
4352,III,"Houston, and they had tried to inculcate in him the best principles,"
4353,III,and train him to be a good and useful citizen. When about 18 years of
4354,III,age he met a man on the street one night who persuaded him to visit
4355,III,the rooms of the association.
4356,III,
4357,III,"After taking a bath and joining in the singing of a hymn, he was led"
4358,III,"into a game of checkers by some smooth talking young man, and finally"
4359,III,threw all reserve to the winds and without a thought of his mother or
4360,III,"his home, sank back into an arm chair and began to read the editorials"
4361,III,in a religious newspaper.
4362,III,
4363,III,After that his progress in the same direction was easy. He cultivated
4364,III,side whiskers and white ties and fell so swiftly into the alluring
4365,III,ways of his companions that no ice cream and strawberry sociable or
4366,III,Evening of Song in the hall of the association was complete without
4367,III,"Mr. Meeks. He became what is known as a ""capper"" for the hall, and"
4368,III,many poor wandering young fellows strolling aimlessly about the
4369,III,"streets of Houston have good cause to remember the sly, suave,"
4370,III,"plausible voice of the low-browed William Meeks, as he addressed them"
4371,III,"in insinuating tones, and invited them to the gorgeously lighted rooms"
4372,III,of the Young Men's Christian Association.
4373,III,
4374,III,William Meeks had for a long time had his eye upon Fergus O'Hollihan.
4375,III,The innocent straightforwardness of the young Irishman seemed to mark
4376,III,him as an easy prey.
4377,III,
4378,III,"One day he entered Fergus' store, made some trifling purchase, and"
4379,III,then invited him to the hall.
4380,III,
4381,III,"""All right,"" said Fergus, ""I'll walk up with you, as trade is a little"
4382,III,dull. Hadn't we better take along a bottle of whiskey to help pass
4383,III,"away the time?"""
4384,III,
4385,III,"""No,"" said William, with a sly smile. ""There is no need. We have"
4386,III,"plenty to drink up there."""
4387,III,
4388,III,"They passed down the street together, and then it was that Kathleen"
4389,III,"saw them, and the cloud began to gather over her happy young life."
4390,III,
4391,III,"William led Fergus to the door of the steps leading up to the hall,"
4392,III,"gave a sharp glance around to see whether they were observed, and they"
4393,III,ascended the stairs.
4394,III,
4395,III,"""What do you fellows do up there?"" asked Fergus, gazing around the"
4396,III,hall in wonder.
4397,III,
4398,III,"""We read and sing and pray,"" said William. ""Now, come over here, Mr."
4399,III,"O'Hollihan, I have something to show you."""
4400,III,
4401,III,"William went to a large water cooler in the corner, drew a brimming"
4402,III,"glass of ice water, and with a cold and cruel smile curling his lips,"
4403,III,handed it to Fergus.
4404,III,
4405,III,"Ah, little Kathleen, in thy rose-twined cottage, thy dark eyes have"
4406,III,"many a tear in waiting. Could love be omnipresent, that sparkling"
4407,III,glass of water would be dashed to the floor ere it touched thy lover's
4408,III,lips!
4409,III,
4410,III,Fergus took the glass and gazed with wonder at its transparent
4411,III,contents; then seized with some sudden impulse he drained the glass of
4412,III,"water to the last drop. As he drank, William Meeks, with a diabolical"
4413,III,"look of triumph on his face, rubbed his clammy hands together and"
4414,III,exulted.
4415,III,
4416,III,"""What is this stuff?"" asked Fergus; ""this cold, refreshing liquid that"
4417,III,with such exquisite freshness thrills through my heated frame? What
4418,III,"nectar is this, tasteless, colorless and sweet as the morning air that"
4419,III,"quenches thirst, and does not excite the senses? Speak, Mr. Meeks, is"
4420,III,"it to be found elsewhere?"""
4421,III,
4422,III,"""It is water,"" said William, softly, ""and it can be had in plenty."""
4423,III,
4424,III,"""I have often sailed on the bayou,"" said Fergus, ""and have washed my"
4425,III,"hands at the hydrant at home, but I have never before seen any water."""
4426,III,
4427,III,"Fergus drank glass after glass from the cooler, and finally suffered"
4428,III,"William to lead him, reluctant, from the hall."
4429,III,
4430,III,"They parted at the door, and as Fergus went down the street like one"
4431,III,"in some happy dream, saying softly to himself at intervals: ""Water!"""
4432,III,"""Water!"" William Meeks looked after him with a smile of devilish"
4433,III,satisfaction upon his dark face.
4434,III,
4435,III,* * * * *
4436,III,
4437,III,That evening after he closed the store Fergus started home and
4438,III,suddenly felt an imperious thirst come upon him. He was already a
4439,III,slave to this wonderful new liquid that refreshed him so.
4440,III,
4441,III,"He entered a little corner saloon, where he had been in the habit of"
4442,III,stopping to get a drink. The bartender seized a mug and reached for
4443,III,the bottle under the counter.
4444,III,
4445,III,"""Hold on,"" said Fergus; ""don't be so fast. Give me a glass of water,"
4446,III,"please."""
4447,III,
4448,III,"""You owe me ein dollar und five cents,"" he said. ""Blease, Mr."
4449,III,"Hollihan, bay me now pefore you go py yourself too much grazy to him"
4450,III,"remember, und I pe mooch obliged."""
4451,III,
4452,III,Fergus then threw the money upon the counter and staggered out of the
4453,III,saloon.
4454,III,
4455,III,He did not go to see Kathleen that night--he was feeling too badly. He
4456,III,"was wandering about in an agony of thirst, when he saw a piece of ice"
4457,III,as large as a coconut fall from an ice wagon. He seized it in both
4458,III,"hands, and hiding himself behind a pile of lumber sucked the ice"
4459,III,"greedily, with bloodshot eyes and trembling hands."
4460,III,
4461,III,After that he kept a jug of water in the store behind some barrels
4462,III,"under the counter, and when no one was looking he would stoop down,"
4463,III,"and holding up the jug, let the cursed stuff that was driving the"
4464,III,light from Kathleen's dark eyes trickle down his burning throat.
4465,III,
4466,III,* * * * *
4467,III,
4468,III,It was Kathleen's wedding night. The parlor of the little cottage was
4469,III,"brilliantly lit, and roses and evergreens were draped upon the walls."
4470,III,Cape jessamines filled the house with their delicious perfume and
4471,III,wreaths of white lilies were hung upon picture frames and the backs of
4472,III,"chairs. The ceremony was to take place at 9 p.m., and by 7 o'clock"
4473,III,"the guests had begun to assemble, for the smell of the good things"
4474,III,Mrs. O'Malley was cooking pervaded the whole neighborhood.
4475,III,
4476,III,"In the parlor, standing on a trestle decorated with violets and"
4477,III,"evergreens, stood a keg of whiskey as cold as ice, and on the center"
4478,III,"table were several beautifully decorated imported glasses, with quite"
4479,III,a wedding-like polish upon their shining sides.
4480,III,
4481,III,"Kathleen's heart grew lighter as the hour approached. ""When Fergus is"
4482,III,"mine,"" she said to herself, ""I will be so loving and sweet to him that"
4483,III,"this strange melancholy will leave him. If it doesn't, I will pull his"
4484,III,"hair out."""
4485,III,
4486,III,"The minutes crept by, and at half past eight, Kathleen, blushing and"
4487,III,"timid-eyed, and looking like the Lorelei that charmed men's souls from"
4488,III,"their bodies on the purple heights of the Rhine, took her stand by the"
4489,III,"keg, and shyly drew for her father's guests glass after glass of the"
4490,III,"ruby liquid, scarcely less red than the glow upon her own fair cheek."
4491,III,
4492,III,"At a quarter to nine Fergus had not come, and all hands began to grow"
4493,III,anxious.
4494,III,
4495,III,"At ten minutes to nine, Mr. O'Malley brought in his shotgun and"
4496,III,carefully loaded it. Kathleen burst into tears.
4497,III,
4498,III,Where was Fergus O'Hollihan?

4500,III,* * * * *
4501,III,
4502,III,In the garish halls of the Young Men's Christian Association were
4503,III,gathered a group of gay young men.
4504,III,
4505,III,Little do the majority of our citizens know what scenes go on in
4506,III,"places of this kind. Our police well know that these resorts exist,"
4507,III,but such is our system of city government that rarely do the guardians
4508,III,of peace set foot in establishments of the kind. Two or three young
4509,III,"men were playing checkers, feverishly crowning the kings of their"
4510,III,"opponents, and watching the board with that hollow-eyed absorption and"
4511,III,compressed lips so often noted in men of that class. Another played
4512,III,"upon the guitar, while in a corner harsh ribald laughter broke from"
4513,III,the lips of a man who was reading the Austin _Statesman_.
4514,III,
4515,III,At a little table at one side of the room sat Fergus O'Hollihan and
4516,III,"William Meeks. Before them, on a waiter, were two large glasses of ice"
4517,III,"water. William Meeks was speaking in a low, treacherous voice, and"
4518,III,Fergus was listening with an abandoned and reckless look upon his
4519,III,face.
4520,III,
4521,III,"""Sobriety,"" said William, insinuatingly, as his snaky eyes were fixed"
4522,III,"upon the open and ingenious countenance of Fergus, ""sobriety is one of"
4523,III,"our cardinal virtues. Why should a man debase himself, destroy his"
4524,III,"brain, deaden his conscience and forge chains that eventually will"
4525,III,clog his best efforts and ruin his fondest hopes? Let us be men and
4526,III,"live temperate and cleanly lives. Believe me, Mr. O'Hollihan, it is"
4527,III,"the better plan."""
4528,III,
4529,III,Fergus' unsteady hand went out to the glass of water and he tossed it
4530,III,"down his throat. ""More,"" he gasped, gazing with feverish eyes. A"
4531,III,member of the association in passing by stopped and laid his hand on
4532,III,William's shoulder.
4533,III,
4534,III,"""Old man,"" he said in a whisper, ""the boys know you've struck a soft"
4535,III,"thing, but don't carry it too far. We don't want to have to bore"
4536,III,"another artesian well."""
4537,III,
4538,III,"William shot a glance of displeasure at the young man, and he went"
4539,III,away.
4540,III,
4541,III,"Just then a quartette began to sing ""Come, Thou Fount,"" and Fergus,"
4542,III,"forgetting all his associations and best impulses, joined in with his"
4543,III,"strong tenor, and William Meeks' face wore a look of fiendish"
4544,III,gloating.
4545,III,
4546,III,At this moment Kathleen was weeping in her mother's arms. Mr. O'Malley
4547,III,"was just ramming down the wad on the buckshot in his gun, and the"
4548,III,beautiful wedding supper was growing cold upon the banquet table.
4549,III,
4550,III,Suddenly in the street before the hall a brass band began to play an
4551,III,air that was Kathleen's favorite. It brought Fergus to his senses. He
4552,III,sprang to his feet and overturned the table and William Meeks. William
4553,III,"sprang to his feet, rushed to the cooler and drawing a glass of water"
4554,III,thrust it into Fergus' hands. Fergus hurled the glass to the floor and
4555,III,made a dash for the door. The secretary of the association met him
4556,III,there with the water hose and turned it full in his face. Fergus shut
4557,III,"his mouth tightly, put the secretary to sleep with one on the point of"
4558,III,"his chin, and dashed down the stairs into the street."
4559,III,
4560,III,* * * * *
4561,III,
4562,III,"As the clock struck nine, Mr. O'Malley placed two caps on his gun and"
4563,III,one upon his head and started to find his son-in-law elect. The door
4564,III,burst open and Fergus rushed in. Kathleen ran to meet him with open
4565,III,"arms, but he waved her sternly aside."
4566,III,
4567,III,"""I have first,"" he said, ""a duty to perform."" He knelt before the"
4568,III,"whiskey keg, closed his mouth over the faucet and turned on the"
4569,III,handle.
4570,III,
4571,III,"Sing, happy birds, in the green trees, but your songs make not half"
4572,III,the melody that ripples in the glad heart of little Kathleen.
4573,III,
4574,III,"When Fergus arose from the keg, he was the same old Fergus once more."
4575,III,"He gathered his bride to his heart, and Mr. O'Malley fired both"
4576,III,barrels of his gun into the ceiling with joy. Fergus was rescued.

4583,III,
4584,III,This little story will be a disappointment to women who read it. They
4585,III,"will all say: ""I don't see anything in that."" Probably there isn't"
4586,III,much.
4587,III,
4588,III,Mrs. Jessamine lives in Houston. You can meet any number of ladies
4589,III,every day out walking on Main Street that resemble her very much. She
4590,III,"is not famous or extraordinary in any way. She has a nice family, is"
4591,III,in moderate circumstances and lives in her own house. I would call her
4592,III,an average woman if that did not imply that some were below the
4593,III,"average, which would be an ungallant insinuation. Mrs. Jessamine is a"
4594,III,genuine woman. She always steps on a street car with her left foot
4595,III,"first, wears her snowiest lace-trimmed sub-skirts on muddy days, and"
4596,III,"can cut a magazine, wind a clock, pick walnuts, open a trunk and clean"
4597,III,"out an inkstand, all with a hairpin. She can take twenty dollars worth"
4598,III,of trimming and make over an old dress so you couldn't tell it from a
4599,III,"brand new fifteen dollar one. She is intelligent, reads the newspapers"
4600,III,regularly and once cut a cooking recipe out of an old magazine that
4601,III,took the prize offered by a newspaper for the best original directions
4602,III,for making a green tomato pie. Her husband has such confidence in her
4603,III,"household management that he trusts her with the entire housekeeping,"
4604,III,sometimes leaving her in charge until a late hour of the night.
4605,III,
4606,III,"Mrs. Jessamine is thoughtful, kindhearted and an excellent manager."
4607,III,"She has two children, a little boy of 7 and a little girl of 4, of"
4608,III,whom she is extravagantly fond. The Jessamines are going to keep a
4609,III,"cook as soon as Mr. Jessamine's salary is raised, but just at present"
4610,III,Mrs. Jessamine is doing her own work.
4611,III,
4612,III,While she is attending to her duties she gives the children a paper of
4613,III,"needles, the scissors, some sample packages of aniline dyes and a box"
4614,III,"of safety matches to play with, and during the intervals of baking and"
4615,III,"sweeping the rooms she rushes in, kisses and cuddles them and then"
4616,III,flies back to her work singing merrily.
4617,III,
4618,III,One afternoon last week Mrs. Jessamine was lying on the bed reading a
4619,III,Sunday paper. The children were blowing soap bubbles with some old
4620,III,pipestems of Mr. Jessamine's that he had discarded because they were
4621,III,full of nicotine.
4622,III,
4623,III,Mrs. Jessamine was reading an account of some cruel treatment of
4624,III,"children that had been unearthed by the Gerry Society, and the tears"
4625,III,came to her eyes as she thought of the heartless and criminally
4626,III,careless mothers of the land who are the cause of so much suffering to
4627,III,their innocent little ones.
4628,III,
4629,III,Presently she fell asleep and dreamed this dream:
4630,III,
4631,III,She was all alone in a great room. She heard the doorbell snap and
4632,III,footsteps leaving and dying away in the hall outside. The room was a
4633,III,"strange one, and she went about to examine it. She paused in front of"
4634,III,"a mirror and saw her reflection, and lo, she was a little child, in a"
4635,III,"white pinafore, with wide-open, wondering eyes and tangled dark curls."
4636,III,
4637,III,She heard the front door below stairs close and the gate open and
4638,III,"shut. She began to play around the room with some dolls and pictures,"
4639,III,and for a while was quite happy.
4640,III,
4641,III,She undressed and dressed her doll and talked to it soothingly and put
4642,III,"it to bed. She could see out the window, but there were some big trees"
4643,III,growing in the yard and the wind blew a branch against the corner of
4644,III,"the house, making a queer noise that rather frightened her. Then she"
4645,III,saw the closet door standing open and a lot of different shaped
4646,III,bottles on a low shelf. She dragged a chair in front of the shelf and
4647,III,climbed into it. The bottles had all kinds of pretty colored liquids
4648,III,in them and she found some that she could pull the corks from quite
4649,III,easily. She tasted one or two of the corks. Some of them were sweet
4650,III,and nice and one was bitter and badtasting. One bottle was full of
4651,III,"something clear like water, so she got that one and pulled out the"
4652,III,"cork, but the bottle slipped from her hand, fell to the floor and"
4653,III,broke. Where the liquid spilled it fumed and sputtered and turned
4654,III,"green, and a kind of hot, biting vapor arose. She climbed down and"
4655,III,"began to feel lonesome and scared. She called ""Mamma,"" three or four"
4656,III,"times loudly, but all the house was still. Then she began to cry and"
4657,III,ran to the door. Just then she thought she heard something scratch
4658,III,"behind the bed, and she screamed and beat upon the door with her"
4659,III,"hands, crying for her mamma to come. Nobody answered her."
4660,III,
4661,III,Then she listened fearfully for a little and crept over and got her
4662,III,dolly from its bed and crouched in a corner whimpering and hugging her
4663,III,"doll tightly, with her heart beating wildly, and watching the dark"
4664,III,place under the bed with frightened eyes.
4665,III,
4666,III,Presently she saw a pretty red box on a table and curiosity for the
4667,III,moment overcame her fear. She opened the box and saw a lot of funny
4668,III,"little sticks, with little round heads on them. She played with them"
4669,III,"on the floor, building little pigpens and fences and houses."

4671,III,In changing her position her heel fell upon the little sticks and the

4678,III,Mrs. Jessamine awoke with a start and sprang wildly from the bed. The
4679,III,"children were playing merrily on the floor, and she ran to them and"
4680,III,caught them in her arms in thankfulness that the terrible dream was
4681,III,over. How she wished for someone to whom she could relate it and gain
4682,III,"sympathy. Three blocks away lived Mrs. Flutter, her best friend and"
4683,III,confidante. Not for a long time had Mrs. Jessamine had a dream that
4684,III,made such an impression upon her mind.
4685,III,
4686,III,She hastily put on her hat and cloak and said:
4687,III,
4688,III,"""Now, be good children till I come back."" Then she went out, locked"

4697,III,How She Got in the Swim
4698,III,
4699,III,There was no happier couple in all Houston than George W. St. Bibbs
4700,III,and his wife before the shadow of the tempter crossed their path. It
4701,III,is remarkable how the tempter always comes up so his shadow will fall
4702,III,"across one's path, isn't it? It seems as if a tempter who knew his"
4703,III,business would either approach on the other side or select a cloudy
4704,III,"day for crossing people's paths. But, we digress."
4705,III,
4706,III,"The St. Bibbses lived in a cosy and elegantly furnished cottage, and"
4707,III,had everything that could be procured on credit. They had two charming
4708,III,little girls named Dolly and Polly.
4709,III,
4710,III,George St. Bibbs loved fashionable society and his wife was domestic
4711,III,"in her ways, so she had made him move to Houston, so that he would not"
4712,III,"have a chance to gratify his tastes. However, George still went to"
4713,III,"functions, and things of that kind, and left his wife at home."
4714,III,
4715,III,"One night there was to be a very high-toned blowout by society people,"
4716,III,gotten up by the Business League and the Daughters of the Survivors of
4717,III,the Confederate Reunion.
4718,III,
4719,III,"After George had left, his wife looked into her little hand mirror and"
4720,III,said to herself:
4721,III,
4722,III,"""I'll bet a dollar there isn't a lady at that ball that stacks up half"
4723,III,"as well as I do when I fix up."""
4724,III,
4725,III,Then an idea struck her.
4726,III,
4727,III,"She rang for her maid and told her to bring a cup of hot tea, and then"
4728,III,"she dressed in a magnificent evening dress, left the maid to look"
4729,III,after Dolly and Polly and got on the street car and went to the ball.
4730,III,
4731,III,George was at the ball enjoying himself very much. All the tony people
4732,III,"were there, and music's voluptuous swell rose like everything, and"
4733,III,"soft eyes looked love to eyes that spake again, and all that sort of"
4734,III,thing.
4735,III,
4736,III,"Among the guests was the Vicomte Carolus de Villiers, a distinguished"
4737,III,"French nobleman, who had been forced to leave Paris on account of some"
4738,III,"political intrigue, and who now worked on a large strawberry farm near"
4739,III,Alvin.
4740,III,
4741,III,"The viscount stood near a portiere picking his teeth, when he saw Mrs."
4742,III,St. Bibbs enter.
4743,III,
4744,III,"He was at her side in a moment, and had written his name opposite hers"
4745,III,for every dance.
4746,III,
4747,III,"George looked over and saw them, and gasped in surprise: ""Jerusalem,"
4748,III,"that's Molly!"""
4749,III,
4750,III,He leaned against a velvet cul-de-sac near the doorway and watched
4751,III,them. Mrs. St. Bibbs was the belle of the evening. Everybody crowded
4752,III,"about her, and the viscount leaned over her and talked in his most"
4753,III,"engaging manner, fanning her with an old newspaper, as she smiled"
4754,III,"brightly upon him, a brilliant stream of wit, persiflage and repartee"
4755,III,falling from her lips.
4756,III,
4757,III,"""_Mon dieu!_"" said the viscount to himself, as his ardent gaze rested"
4758,III,"upon her, ""I wish I knew who she is."""
4759,III,
4760,III,At supper Mrs. St. Bibbs was the life of the gang. She engaged in a
4761,III,"witty discussion with the brightest intellects around the table,"
4762,III,completely overwhelming the boss joshers of the town. She conversed
4763,III,"readily with gents from the wards, speaking their own dialect, and"
4764,III,even answered without hesitation a question put to her by a man who
4765,III,had a sister attending the State University.
4766,III,
4767,III,"George could scarcely believe that this fascinating, brilliant woman"
4768,III,of the world was the quiet little wife he had left at home that
4769,III,evening.
4770,III,
4771,III,"When the ball was over and the musicians had been stood off, George"
4772,III,"went up to his wife, feeling ashamed and repentant."
4773,III,
4774,III,"""Molly,"" he said, ""forgive me. I didn't know how beautiful and gay you"
4775,III,could be in swell society. The next time our Longfellow Literary
4776,III,Coterie gives a fish fry at the Hook and Ladder Company Hall I'll take
4777,III,"you along."""
4778,III,
4779,III,Mrs. St. Bibbs took her husband's arm with a sweet smile.
4780,III,
4781,III,"""All right, George,"" she said, ""I just wanted you to see that this"
4782,III,town can't put up no society shindigs that are too high up for me to
4783,III,"tackle. I once spent two weeks in Galveston, and I generally catch on"
4784,III,"to what's proper as quick as anybody."""
4785,III,
4786,III,At present there are no two society people in town more sought after
4787,III,and admired than George St. Bibbs and his accomplished wife.

4793,III,The Barber Talks
4794,III,
4795,III,"The Post Man slid into the chair with an apologetic manner, for the"
4796,III,"barber's gaze was superior and scornful. He was so devilish, cool and"
4797,III,"selfpossessed, and held the public in such infinite contempt."
4798,III,
4799,III,The Post Man's hair had been cut close with the clippers on the day
4800,III,before.
4801,III,
4802,III,"""Haircut?"" asked the barber in a quiet but thoroughly dangerous tone."
4803,III,
4804,III,"""Shave,"" said the Post Man."
4805,III,
4806,III,"The barber raised his eyebrows, gave his victim a look of deep"
4807,III,"disdain, and hurled the chair with a loud rattle and crash back to a"
4808,III,reclining position.
4809,III,
4810,III,"Then he seized a mug and brush and, after bestowing upon the Post Man"
4811,III,"a look of undying contumely, turned with a sneer to the water faucet."
4812,III,"Thence he returned, enveloped the passive victim in a voluminous"
4813,III,"cloth, and with a pitiless hand daubed a great brushful of sweetish"
4814,III,tasting lather across his mouth.
4815,III,
4816,III,Then he began to talk.
4817,III,
4818,III,"""Ever been in Seattle, Washington Territory?"" he asked."
4819,III,
4820,III,"""Blub-a-lub-blub,"" said the Post Man, struggling against the soap, and"
4821,III,then he shook his head feebly.
4822,III,
4823,III,"""Neither have I,"" said the barber, ""but I have a brother named Bill"
4824,III,"who runs an orange orchard nine miles from St. John, Fla. That's only"
4825,III,a split hair on your neck; it's growing the wrong way. They are caused
4826,III,by shaving the neck in the wrong direction. Sometimes whiskey will
4827,III,"make them do that way. Whisky is a terrible thing. Do you drink it?"""
4828,III,
4829,III,The Post Man only had one eye of all his features uncovered by lather
4830,III,and he tried to throw an appealing expression implying negation into
4831,III,"this optic, but the barber was too quick for him and filled the eye"
4832,III,with soap by a dextrous flap of his brush.
4833,III,
4834,III,"""My brother Bill used to drink,"" continued the barber. ""He could drink"
4835,III,"more whiskey than any man in Houston, but he never got drunk. He had a"
4836,III,"chair in my shop, but I had to let him go. Bill had a wonderful"
4837,III,constitution. When he got all he could hold he would quit drinking.
4838,III,The only way he showed it was in his eyes. They would get kind of
4839,III,glazed and fishy and wouldn't turn in his head. When Bill wanted to
4840,III,look to one side he used to take his fingers and turn his eyeballs a
4841,III,little the way he wanted to see. His eyes looked exactly like those
4842,III,little round windows you see in the dome of the postoffice. You could
4843,III,hear Bill breathe across the street when he was full. He could shave
4844,III,"people when he was drunk as well as he could sober.--Razor hurt you?"""
4845,III,
4846,III,The Post Man tried to wave one of his hands to disclaim any sense of
4847,III,"pain, but the barber's quick eye caught the motion and he leaned his"
4848,III,"weight against the hand, crushing it against the chair."
4849,III,
4850,III,"""I kept noticing,"" went on the barber, ""that Bill was getting about"
4851,III,"four customers to my one, even if he did drink so much. People would"
4852,III,come in three or four at a time and sit down and wait their turns with
4853,III,Bill when my chair was vacant. I didn't know what to make of it. Bill
4854,III,"had all he could do, and he was so crowded that he didn't have time to"
4855,III,"go out to a saloon, but he kept a big jug in the back room, and every"
4856,III,few minutes he would slip in there and take a drink.
4857,III,
4858,III,"""One day I noticed a man that got out of Bill's chair acting queer and"
4859,III,he staggered as he went out. A day or two afterwards the shop was full
4860,III,"of customers from morning till night, and one man came back and had a"
4861,III,shave three different times in the forenoon. In a couple of days more
4862,III,"there was a crowd of men in the shop, and they had a line formed"
4863,III,outside two or three doors down the sidewalk. Bill made $9.00 that
4864,III,day. That evening a policeman came in and jerked me up for running a
4865,III,saloon without a license. It seems that Bill's breath was so full of
4866,III,whiskey that every man he shaved went out feeling pretty hilarious and
4867,III,"sent his friends there to be shaved. It cost me $300 to get out of it,"
4868,III,"and I shipped Bill to Florida pretty soon afterward."""
4869,III,
4870,III,* * * * *
4871,III,
4872,III,"""I was sent for once,"" went on the barber, as he seized his victim by"
4873,III,"the ear and slammed his head over on the other side, ""to go out on"
4874,III,Piney Street and shave a dead man. Barbers don't much like a job of
4875,III,"that kind, although they get from $5 to $10 for the work. It was 1908"
4876,III,Piney Street. I started about 11 o'clock at night. I found the street
4877,III,all right and I counted from the corner until I found 1908. I had my
4878,III,"razors, soap and mug in a little case I use for such purposes. I went"
4879,III,in and knocked at the door. An old man opened it and his eye fell on
4880,III,my case.
4881,III,
4882,III,"""'You've come, have you?' he asked. 'Well, go upstairs; he's in the"
4883,III,front room to your right. There's nobody with him. He hasn't any
4884,III,friends or relatives in town; he's only been boarding here about a
4885,III,week.'
4886,III,
4887,III,"""'How long since he--since it occurred?' I asked."
4888,III,
4889,III,"""'About an hour, I guess,' says the old man. I was glad of that"
4890,III,because corpses always shave better before they get good and cold. I
4891,III,went in the room and turned up the lamp. The man was laid out on the
4892,III,bed. He was warm yet and he had about a week's growth of beard on. I
4893,III,got to work and in half an hour I had given him a nice clean shave
4894,III,that would have done his heart good if he had been alive. Then I went
4895,III,downstairs and saw the old man.
4896,III,
4897,III,"""'What success?' he asked."
4898,III,
4899,III,"""'Good,' says I. 'He's fixed up all right. Who's to pay?'"
4900,III,
4901,III,"""'He gave me $30 to send his folks in Alabama yesterday,' says the old"
4902,III,man. 'I guess your fee will have to come out of it.'
4903,III,
4904,III,"""'It'll be five,' I said."
4905,III,
4906,III,"""The old man handed me a five dollar bill and I went home very well"
4907,III,"satisfied."""
4908,III,
4909,III,"Here the barber seized the chair, hurled it upright, snatched off the"
4910,III,"cloth, buried his hands in the Post Man's hair and tore out a handful,"
4911,III,"bumped and thumped his head, shook it violently and hissed"
4912,III,"sarcastically: ""Bay rum?"""
4913,III,
4914,III,"The Post Man nodded stupidly, closed his eyes and tried unsuccessfully"
4915,III,to recall a prayer.
4916,III,
4917,III,"""Next day,"" said the barber, ""I heard some news. It seems that a man"
4918,III,had died at 1908 Piney Street and just a little while before a man in
4919,III,the next house had taken poison. The folks in one house sent for a
4920,III,doctor and the ones in the other sent for a barber. The funny part is
4921,III,the doctor and I both made a mistake and got into the wrong house. He
4922,III,went in to see the dead man and found the family doctor just getting
4923,III,"ready to leave. The doctor didn't waste any time asking questions, but"
4924,III,"got out his stomach pump, stuck it into the dead man and went to work"
4925,III,pumping the poison out. All this time I was busy shaving the man who
4926,III,had taken poison. And the funniest part of it all is that after the
4927,III,"doctor had pumped all the other doctor's medicine out of the dead man,"
4928,III,"he opened his eyes, raised up in bed and asked for a steak and"
4929,III,potatoes.
4930,III,
4931,III,"""This made the family doctor mad, and he and the doctor with a stomach"
4932,III,pump got into a fight and fell down the stairs and broke the hat rack
4933,III,"all to pieces."""
4934,III,
4935,III,"""And how about your man who had taken poison?"" asked the Post Man"
4936,III,timidly.
4937,III,
4938,III,"""Him?"" said the barber, ""why he died, of course, but he died with one"
4939,III,"of the beautifulest shaves that ever a man had.--Brush!"""
4940,III,
4941,III,"An African of terrible aspect bore down upon the Post Man, struck him"

4943,III,and ripped it loose from its collar.

4954,III,When the Post Man entered the shop yesterday the chairs were full of

4956,III,"might escape, but the barber's eye, deadly and gloomy fixed itself"
4957,III,upon him.
4958,III,
4959,III,"""You're next,"" he said, with a look of diabolical malevolence, and the"
4960,III,"Post Man sank into a hard chair nailed to the wall, with a feeling of"
4961,III,hopeless despair.
4962,III,
4963,III,"In a few moments there was a rattle and a bang, the customer in the"

4966,III,broom full of tacks and splinters.

4971,III,
4972,III,"He informed the barber, in answer to a stern inquiry, that he did not"
4973,III,"want his hair cut, and in turn received a look of cold incredulity and"
4974,III,contempt.
4975,III,
4976,III,"The chair was hurled to a reclining position, the lather was mixed,"
4977,III,"and as the deadly brush successively stopped all sense of hearing,"
4978,III,"sight and smell, the Post Man sank into a state of collapse, from which"
4979,III,he was aroused by the loud noise of a steel instrument with which the barber was scraping off the lather and wiping it on the Post Man's shirt sleeve.
4980,III,
4981,III,"""Everybody's riding bicycles now,"" said the barber, ""and it's going to"
4982,III,be very difficult for the fashionable people to keep it an exclusive
4983,III,"exercise. You see, you can't prevent anybody from riding a bicycle"
4984,III,"that wants to, and the streets are free for everyone. I don't see any"
4985,III,"harm in the sport, myself, and it's getting more popular every day."
4986,III,"After a while, riding will become so general that a lady on a wheel"
4987,III,will not create any more notice than she would walking. It's good
4988,III,"exercise for the ladies, and that makes up for their looking like a"
4989,III,bag full of fighting cats slung over a clothes line when they ride.

5018,III,"leaders among the girls who believed in the emancipation of women, and"

5027,III,"""'How dare you insult me!' she stormed, looking as if she would like"
5028,III,"to eat me up. 'Leave the house, immediately,' she went on."
5029,III,
5030,III,"""I was dumbfounded. I thought perhaps she was a trifle flighty, so I"
5031,III,"put up my utensils and started for the door. When I got there, I"
5032,III,recovered my presence of mind enough to say:
5033,III,
5034,III,"""Miss, I am sure I have done nothing to offend you. I always try to"

5045,III,"""I think that's a pretty tough story to believe,"" said the Post Man,"
5046,III,summoning up his courage.
5047,III,
5048,III,The barber stopped shaving and bent a gaze of such malignant and cool
5049,III,ferocity upon his victim that the Post Man hastened to say:

5051,III,"""But no doubt it occurred as you have stated."""
5052,III,
5053,III,"""It did,"" said the barber. ""I don't ask you to take my word for it. I"
5054,III,"can prove it. Do you see that blue mug on the shelf, the third from"
5055,III,"the right? Well, that's the mug I carried with me that day. I guess"

5057,III,
5058,III,"""Speaking of bald heads,"" went on the barber, although no one had said"
5059,III,"a word about bald heads, ""reminds me of how a man worked a game on me"
5060,III,once right here in Houston. You know there's nothing in the world that
5061,III,will make hair grow on a bald head. Lots of things are sold for that
5062,III,"purpose, but if the roots are dead nothing can bring them to life. A"
5063,III,man came into my shop one day last fall and had a shave. His head was
5064,III,as bald and smooth as a tea cup. All the tonics in the world couldn't
5065,III,"have started one hair growing there. The man was a stranger to me, but"
5066,III,said he ran a truck garden out on the edge of town. He came in about
5067,III,three times and got shaved and then he struck me to fix him up
5068,III,"something to make his hair grow."""
5069,III,
5070,III,The barber here reached back upon a shelf and got a strip of sticking
5071,III,plaster. Then he cut a gash along the Post Man's chin and stuck the
5072,III,plaster over it.
5073,III,
5074,III,"""When a man asks for a hair tonic,"" continued the barber, ""in a"
5075,III,barbershop he always gets it. You can fix up a mixture that a man may
5076,III,use on his head for a long time before he finds it is doing him no
5077,III,good. In the meantime he continues to shave in your shop.
5078,III,
5079,III,"""I told my customer that I had invented a hair tonic that if its use"
5080,III,were persisted in would certainly cause the hair to grow on the
5081,III,smoothest head. I sat down and wrote him out a formula and told him to
5082,III,"have it prepared at a drug store and not to give away the information,"
5083,III,as I intended after a while to have it patented and sell it on a large
5084,III,"scale. The recipe contained a lot of harmless stuff, some salts of"
5085,III,"tartar, oil of almonds, bay rum, rose water, tincture of myrrh and"
5086,III,some other ingredients. I wrote them down at random just as they came
5087,III,"into my head, and half an hour afterwards I couldn't have told what it"
5088,III,"was composed of myself. The man took it, paid me a dollar for the"
5089,III,formula and went off to get it filled at a drug store.
5090,III,
5091,III,"""He came back twice that week to get shaved, and he said he was using"
5092,III,it faithfully. Then he didn't come any more for about two weeks. He
5093,III,"dropped in one afternoon and hung his hat up, and it nearly knocked me"
5094,III,down when I saw that the finest kind of a suit of hair had started on
5095,III,"his head. It was growing splendidly, and only two weeks before his"
5096,III,head had been as bald as a door knob.
5097,III,
5098,III,"""He said he was awfully pleased with my tonic, and well he might be."
5099,III,While I was shaving him I tried to think what the ingredients were
5100,III,"that I had written down for him to use, but I couldn't remember the"
5101,III,quantities or half the things I had used. I knew that I had
5102,III,"accidentally struck upon a tonic that would make the hair grow, and I"
5103,III,knew furthermore that that formula was worth a million dollars to any
5104,III,"man if it would do the work. Making hair grow on bald heads, if it"
5105,III,"could be done, would be better than any gold mine ever worked. I made"
5106,III,up my mind to have that formula. When he was about to start away I
5107,III,said carelessly:
5108,III,
5109,III,"""'By the way, Mr. Plunket, I have mislaid my memorandum book that has"
5110,III,the formula of my tonic in it and I want to have a bottle or two
5111,III,prepared this morning. If you have the one I gave you I'd like to make
5112,III,a copy of it while you are here.'
5113,III,
5114,III,"""I must have looked too anxious, for he looked at me for a few minutes"
5115,III,and then broke out into a laugh.
5116,III,
5117,III,"""'By Jiminy,' he said, 'I don't believe you've got a copy of it"
5118,III,anywheres. I believe you just happend to hit on the right thing and
5119,III,you don't remember what it was. I ain't half as green as I look. That
5120,III,"hair grower is worth a fortune, and a big one, too. I think I'll just"
5121,III,keep my recipe and get somebody to put the stuff up and sell it.'
5122,III,
5123,III,"""He started out, and I called him into the back room and talked to him"
5124,III,half an hour.
5125,III,
5126,III,"""I finally made a trade with him and bought the formula back for $250"
5127,III,cash. I went up to the bank and got the money which I had there saving
5128,III,up to build a house. He then gave me back the recipe I had given him
5129,III,and signed a paper relinquishing all rights to it. He also agreed to
5130,III,sign a testimonial about the stuff having made his hair grow out in
5131,III,"two weeks."""
5132,III,
5133,III,The barber began to look gloomy and ran his fingers inside the Post
5134,III,"Man's shirt collar, tearing out the button hole, and the collar button"
5135,III,flew out the door across the sidewalk into the gutter.
5136,III,
5137,III,"""I went to work next day,"" said the barber, ""and filed application at"
5138,III,Washington for a patent on my tonic and arranged with a big drug firm
5139,III,in Houston to put it on the market for me. I had a million dollars in
5140,III,sight. I fixed up a room where I mixed the tonic--for I wouldn't let
5141,III,the druggists or anybody else know what was in it--and then the
5142,III,druggists bottled and labeled it.
5143,III,
5144,III,"""I quit working in the shop and put all my time into my tonic."
5145,III,
5146,III,"""Mr. Plunket came into the shop once or twice within the next two"
5147,III,weeks and his hair was still growing finely. Pretty soon I had about
5148,III,"$200 worth of the tonic ready for the market, and Mr. Plunket was to"
5149,III,come in town on Saturday and give me his testimonial to print on
5150,III,advertising dodgers and circulars with which I was going to flood the
5151,III,country.
5152,III,
5153,III,"""I was waiting in the room where I mixed my tonic about 11 o'clock"
5154,III,Saturday when the door opened and Mr. Plunket came in. He was very
5155,III,much excited and very angry.
5156,III,
5157,III,"""'Look here,' he cried, 'what's the matter with your infernal stuff?'"
5158,III,
5159,III,"""He pulled off his hat, and his head was as shiny and bare as a china"
5160,III,egg.
5161,III,
5162,III,"""'It all came out,' he said roughly. 'It was growing all right until"
5163,III,"yesterday morning, when it commenced to fall out, and this morning"
5164,III,there wasn't a hair left.'
5165,III,
5166,III,"""I examined his head and there wasn't the ghost of a hair to be found"
5167,III,anywhere.
5168,III,
5169,III,"""'What's the good of your stuff,"" he asked angrily, 'if it makes your"
5170,III,hair grow and then all fall out again?'
5171,III,
5172,III,"""'For heaven's sake, Mr. Plunket,' I said, 'don't say anything about"
5173,III,it or you'll ruin me. I've got every cent I've got in the world
5174,III,"invested in this hair tonic, and I've got to get my money back. It"
5175,III,"made your hair grow, give me the testimonial and let me sell what I've"
5176,III,"got put up, anyway. You are $250 ahead on it and you ought to help me"
5177,III,out of it.'
5178,III,
5179,III,"""He was very mad and cut up quite roughly and said he had been"
5180,III,swindled and would expose the tonic as a fraud and a lot of things
5181,III,like that. Finally he agreed that if I would pay him $100 more he
5182,III,would give me the testimonial to the effect that the tonic had made
5183,III,his hair grow and say nothing about its having fallen out again. If I
5184,III,could sell what I had put up at $1.00 per bottle I would come out
5185,III,about even.
5186,III,
5187,III,"""I went out and borrowed the money and paid it to him and he signed"
5188,III,"the testimonial and left."""

5191,III,
5192,III,"""Did you sell your tonic out?"" asked the Post Man, trying to speak in"
5193,III,a tone calculated not to give offense.
5194,III,
5195,III,The barber gave him a look of derisive contempt and then said in a
5196,III,tone of the utmost sarcasm:
5197,III,
5198,III,"""Oh, yes, I sold it out. I sold exactly five bottles, and the"
5199,III,"purchasers, after using the mixture faithfully for a month, came back"
5200,III,and demanded their money. Not one of them that used it ever had a new
5201,III,"hair to start on his head."""
5202,III,
5203,III,"""How do you account for its having made the hair grow on Mr. Plunket's"
5204,III,"head?"" asked the Post Man."
5205,III,
5206,III,"""How do I account for it?"" repeated the barber in so dangerous a tone"
5207,III,"that the Post Man shuddered. ""How do I account for it? I'll tell you"
5208,III,how I account for it. I went out one day to where Mr. Plunket lived on
5209,III,the edge of town and asked for him.
5210,III,
5211,III,"""'Which Mr. Plunket?' asked a man who came out to the gate?"
5212,III,
5213,III,"""'Come off,' I said, 'the Plunket that lives here.'"
5214,III,
5215,III,"""'They've both moved,' said the man."
5216,III,
5217,III,"""'What do you mean by ""both?""' I said, and then I began to think, and"
5218,III,I said to the man:
5219,III,
5220,III,"""'What kind of looking men were the Plunkets?'"
5221,III,
5222,III,"""'As much like as two peas,' said the man. 'They were twins, and"
5223,III,nobody could tell 'em apart from their faces or their talk. The only
5224,III,difference between 'em was that one of 'em was as bald-headed as a hen
5225,III,"egg and the other had plenty of hair.'"""
5226,III,
5227,III,"""Now,"" said the barber as he poured about two ounces of bay rum down"
5228,III,"the Post Man's shirt front, ""that's how I account for it. The"
5229,III,bald-headed Plunket would come in my shop one time and the one with
5230,III,"hair would come in another, and I never knew the difference."""
5231,III,
5232,III,When the barber finished the Post Man saw the African with the whisk
5233,III,"broom waiting for him near the front door, so he fled by the back"

5291,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
5292,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,The procession was nearly twenty minutes passing a given point. The
5293,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"cages were new, and the horses, especially, were magnificent specimens"
5294,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,of their kind. The animals exhibited were in good condition as a rule
5295,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,and some of them assumed to perfection their role of wild beasts. The
5296,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"lions, however, appeared to be old, and were mere wrecks of the king"

5301,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"of the world's nations was immense. England, France, Germany, Turkey,"
5302,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"Belgium, and other nations were represented by cavalry attired in the"

5305,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"sailors on the four corners, Jesse James and Richard Croker in the"

5308,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,a little too far when they procure Roman matrons of the time of Marcus

5426,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,generally follow circuses are not allowed to annoy the crowd. The
5427,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,tents are large and the accommodations good. Their immense business is

5433,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"The performance itself was only the average circus performance, with a"
5434,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"great deal that was neither new nor remarkable, but with a feature"
5435,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,here and there that was far above the ordinary even in that line. The
5436,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,trouble is in attempting to do too much. Had the programme been
5437,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"executed in the old style, in one ring, it might have been too long;"
5438,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,but it would have impressed the public far more than when distributed
5439,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,among three rings. The spectator becomes bewildered and catches a good
5440,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"thing only now and then, while he misses possibly two or three other"
5441,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,brilliant acts. There could have been no complaint for want of
5442,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,variety. There was a little of everything and all done at least with
5443,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,the usual skill of the circus performer.
5444,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
5445,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"Several innovations were introduced, among them a female ring master"
5446,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"and a female clown. Trilby on horseback, a skirt dance on horseback,"
5447,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"and a serpentine dance on horseback are others. The water carnival, an"
5448,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"exhibition of high diving, somersaults into water and other aquatic"
5449,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,sports is perhaps the newest circus idea. It is given in a lake of
5450,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"water, to use the fertile press agent's phrase, forty-two feet across"
5451,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"and six feet deep. In the menagerie are a number of new animals,"

5455,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"this peripatetic plaisance, which contains a curious assortment of"
5456,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"curious peoples. In its acrobatic department, the aerial swinging and"
5457,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,leaping and high trapeze work were very fine indeed; and with the
5458,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"equestrian accomplishments of the Meeks sisters, particularly, when"
5459,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"the two rode one horse, constituted the most meritorious parts of the"
5460,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,performance. A notable feature also was the performance in the ring of
5461,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"a herd of elephants, among other things going through a quadrille. It"
5462,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"is such a performance and, to quote the voluble agent again, such an"

5480,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
5481,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,The United States is the only country in the world that has a day of
5482,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,National thanksgiving in commemoration of one special event. Among the
5483,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"earliest settlers in this country, with the exception of cocktails,"
5484,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,were the Pilgrim Fathers. They were a noble band of religious
5485,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"enthusiasts, who sailed from England to America in a ship called the"
5486,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,_Mayflower_ after a celebrated brand of soap by the same name.
5487,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
5488,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,By good fortune and fast sailing they managed to reach America before
5489,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"Thanksgiving Day. They landed at Plymouth Rock, where they were met by"
5490,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"Hon. F. R. Lubbock and welcomed with an address. It was a very cold,"
5491,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"and not a good day for speeches, either."

5493,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"This heroic little band of refugees were called Puritans in England,"

5519,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
5520,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,Governor Carver then appointed a committee with Captain Standish as

5548,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,Massasoit took his place at the side of the blanket that was spread on

5550,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
5551,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,Two hours later the Pilgrim Fathers had won from the Indian chief 200
5552,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"buffalo robes, 100 pelts of the silver fox, 50 tanned deer hides, 300"
5553,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"otter skins, and 150 hides of the beaver, panther and mink."
5554,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
5555,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,This was the original skin game.
5556,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
5557,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"Later on in the game, Governor Carver called a bet of $27 worth of"

5594,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,Priscilla the sprinter was

5704,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"the traveling agent for a book, or, perhaps, a new silverware polish,"
5705,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,has learned the art of traveling. Haste and flurry are unknown to her.
5706,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,A neat traveling cloak and a light hand satchel comprise her
5707,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"accoutrements. She waits patiently, tapping lightly with a patent"
5708,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"leather toe, and faintly humming the refrain of a song. Not so the"
5709,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,large and copious family who are about to make the journey of their
5710,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"lives--at least fifty miles. Baskets, bags, valises, buckets, paper"
5711,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"bundles, pot-plants, babies and dogs cover the benches in their"
5712,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,vicinity. The head of the family wears a look as deadly solemn as if
5713,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,he were on his way to execution. His face shows the strain of the
5714,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,terrible journey he is about to undertake. He holds his tickets in his
5715,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,moist hand with a vice-like grip. Traveling is a serious matter with
5716,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,him. His good lady has taken off her bonnet. She drags out articles
5717,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,from boxes and bags and puts them back; she trots the baby and strews
5718,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"aprons, hairpins, knitted gloves and crackers far and wide. She tells"
5719,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,John where she has hidden $13 under a loose board at home; she would
5720,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"never have mentioned it, but she is certain the train is going to run"
5721,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,off the track and she may be killed. A few grummy looking men sit with
5722,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"their coat collars turned up, by the side of their weary spouses, who"
5723,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"look as if they cared not for accidents, end of the world, or even"
5724,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,fashions. A black-veiled woman with a prattling boy of five sits in a
5725,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"corner, disconsolate and lone; some aimless stragglers enter and"
5726,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,wander through the room and out again.

5732,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"smoke, read and chat. From the buzz of voices fragments of connected"
5733,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,words can be caught that read something like this:

5748,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
5749,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,The train is coming. An official opens the north doors. There is a

5752,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,who know that the train will wait twenty minutes for them after it

5756,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,may be termed--in order not to disappoint the gentle reader--a baleful
5757,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,glare. A disciple of Mr. Howells' realistic school might describe the
5758,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"arrival of the train as follows: ""Clang-clang-chookety"
5759,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,chookety--chookety-clang-clackety clack-chook-ety-chook. Che-e-e-e-ew!

5762,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"The baggage men, with yells of rage, throw themselves upon the trunks"
5763,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,and dash them furiously to the earth. A Swiss emigrant standing near

5771,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,that conveniently presents itself. A couple of brakemen head off a few
5772,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,who are trying to run back under the train and start them off in the
5773,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,right direction.
5774,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
5775,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,The conductor stands like a blue-coated tower of strength in the
5776,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,center of the crowd answering questions with an ease and coolness that
5777,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,would drive a hotel clerk wild with envy. Here are a few of the
5778,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"remarks that are fired at him: ""Oh, conductor, I left one of my gloves"
5779,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,in the car. How long does the train stop? Do you know where Mrs.

5889,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
5890,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"Houston is a typical Southern town. Although a busy, growing city that"
5891,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,is easily holding its place among the half dozen metropolitan cities
5892,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"of the South, it retains most of the old-time Southern customs and"

5895,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"The all-absorbing haste, the breathless rush, the restless scramble"

5899,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,keep up with the march of progress. In no city in the South is
5900,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"Christmas more merrily welcomed with social pleasures, the exchanging"
5901,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"of friendly offerings, and general rejoicing than in Houston. The"

5903,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,the past week testify to the fact.

5905,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,Yesterday was probably the busiest day among the merchants that the
5906,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,season has witnessed; and there is no question but that it brought to

5916,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"earth. Our world must look to them very much as a great ant bed, over"

5939,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,goes to a jeweler's and looks at several trays of diamond studded

5944,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"says she believes she will think over the matter before buying, and"
5945,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"leaves. Next she visits a book store, three dry goods stores, two more"
5946,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"jewelers, and a candy shop. When Christmas morning comes, her father"

6508,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"A few gay young men stroll by occasionally, with their coat collars"

6522,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,life streams moving; where men move like demons in the red glow of

6527,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,One can always see a few men perched on high stools at the all-night

6533,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,The night clerk at the drug store sees much of the sadness and some of
6534,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,the badness of life. Customers stray into the store at all times of
6535,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,the night. The man with the disarranged attire and impatient manner is
6536,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,a frequent visitor. He has a doctor's prescription for some sick
6537,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"member of his family, and thinks it a greater blessing that he finds a"
6538,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,store open and a clerk ready to compound his medicine than to be
6539,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,obliged to tug at a night bell for half an hour to wake up a sleepy
6540,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"clerk, as in times gone by. Desperate-looking men sometimes come in to"
6541,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"buy poison--generally morphine--and occasionally a hopeless, wretched"
6542,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"woman with eyes big with hope deferred and an unpitying fate, will"
6543,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"creep in and beg for something that will stay the pain forever. Often,"
6544,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"in the darkest hour that they say comes before dawn, a man will enter"
6545,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"in a hurry, buy a few pounds of prepared chalk and slip around the"

6552,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"consolation and solace. The doctors, too, see much of the seamy side"
6553,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,of night life. They are out by day and by night; the telephone rouses

6568,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"Has he any hopes, fears, dislikes, ambitions, hates, loves or desires?"
6569,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,Very few. It may be that his is the true philosophy. John Davidson

6571,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
6572,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"I hang about the streets all day,"
6573,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,At night I hang about;

6575,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"But rise, betimes, the morning's scout,"
6576,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,For through the year I always hear
6577,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"Aloud, aloft, a ghostly shout."
6578,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"My clothes are worn to threads and loops,"
6579,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,My skin shows here and there;
6580,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"About my face, like seaweed, droops"
6581,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"My tangled beard, my tangled hair,"
6582,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,From cavernous and shaggy brows
6583,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,My stony eyes untroubled stare.
6584,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"I know no handicraft, no art,"
6585,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,But I have conquered fate;

6589,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"My certain alms, alone I wait."
6590,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"And daily, nightly comes the call,"

6767,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
6768,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,The journalist-poet seems to be a hybrid born of the present day when
6769,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,rapidity and feverish haste are the necessary conditions to success.
6770,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,There is hardly a newspaper of the first class in the land that does
6771,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,not include a jingler in its staff.
6772,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
6773,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"A journalist is one thing, and a poet should be another. A combination"
6774,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,of the two--or rather a man who tries to do the work of both--is very
6775,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,nearly a union of opposites.
6776,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
6777,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,A journalist is a recorder of transient impressions; he seizes
6778,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,whatever is worthy of note from the swiftly-moving stream of current
6779,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"events, and stamping his data with the seal of his own originality--if"
6780,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,he possesses any--he flings his paper damp from the press at the heads
6781,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,of the public and is off pursuing fresh quarry. He is a machine--but
6782,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,of admirable efficiency--that threshes the chaff from the million
6783,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"happenings of the day, and delivers the wheat to those who would"
6784,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,flounder helplessly among the piled sheaves if left to themselves.
6785,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
6786,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,The poet should be of different mold. He should not be vexed with the
6787,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"task of winnowing, but, with the golden grains laid before him by his"
6788,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"more active brother of the winged feet, he should be allowed to sit"
6789,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"apart and view life in its entirety with calmer, larger, and"
6790,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,unobstructed vision. A poet-journalist may rise to be a journalist of
6791,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"renown, but he will never be a great poet. The muse is too shy to"
6792,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,appear daily at the bidding of an ink-grimed copy boy. In glancing
6793,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"over the daily papers, we occasionally find a verse of merit, that,"
6794,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"though evidently scribbled during the daily grind that must come,"
6795,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"whether inspiration impels or not, yet has some touch of the true"
6796,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"fire. Indeed, many gems that will long be remembered have thus been"

6799,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,Some paper mentioned recently that Frank Stanton wrote his exposition
6800,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"ode at his desk amid the confusion of a newspaper office in two hours,"
6801,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,fanning himself with one hand and writing with the other. The ode was
6802,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"said to have been a good one, and much commendation was bestowed upon"
6803,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"the writer. Now, this is unjust to Mr. Stanton's fame, for he can"
6804,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"write poetry, and the people will persist in praising those daily"
6805,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,jingles of his in the Atlanta Constitution. No one seems to suggest
6806,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,that he could have written a much better ode by taking a day or two
6807,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"over it, and not overheating himself and having to waste so much vital"

6821,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,A good paragraph on a timely subject often gains a spiciness by being

6853,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
6854,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,Our Southern poets especially are guilty of over-production. Those
6855,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,among them most generally accepted as representative voices among our
6856,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,writers of verse are occupying positions in which they are doing
6857,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,better work in other than poetic lines. A few of them have talent that
6858,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"would bring them fame if allowed space, time and scope for full"

6868,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"Barrow and Mr. Lamb, have written jingles which they never"
6869,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"called poetry, never expected to be taken as anything more"
6870,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,than ephemeral things to be glanced at and forgotten;
6871,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,written in rhyme because as easily written as a prose

6875,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,are copied and complimented beyond their deserts--I have
6876,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,done so. I shall continue to do so. Why should it be
6877,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,insisted that I want to cram it down one's throat as
6878,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"poetry? Let me jinglify if I want to."""
6879,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
6880,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,Mr. Hale realizes the transient nature of such verse as the journalist

6891,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,
6892,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,One poem on which he would spend days of labor would do much more

6903,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,But the amount of verse he writes daily will not permit of such a high

6911,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,The late Eugene Field might in time have become a poet of considerable
6912,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"ability, but there is little question that his newspaper labors were"
6913,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,too onerous to allow of a thorough development of his poetic powers.
6914,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,The verses he wrote have always been popular because they were simple
6915,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"and musical, and addressed themselves to an almost universal sympathy"
6916,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"for children, and his poems, charming and lovable as they were,"
6917,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"stopped short of being great. It was the subject and the sentiment,"
6918,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"rather than the literary proficiency of his poetical work, that made"
6919,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,him so widely known. A poem to be great and long-remembered must be
6920,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"erected in the same way that a house is built. The foundation, the"

7180,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,I take no alarm from your answer;

7197,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"Of the icy wind is death,"

7201,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,My strength and my will are gone;

7210,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,Do you forget that you are a private?
7211,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,"And I--Oh, God, and what am I,"
7212,WONDERS OF THE STREET PARADE,To lie--but come; let's arrive at

7277,--W. S. P.,Her name and claimed her with fond eyes
7278,--W. S. P.,"And beckoning hands, till from her dream she woke"
7279,--W. S. P.,And gazed. Then spake a Voice kind-toned and wise:
7280,--W. S. P.,
7281,--W. S. P.,"""Choose you between them who your mate shall be;"
7282,--W. S. P.,For heaven were not heaven if it were to lose

7288,--W. S. P.,Twice had her heart gone out in love before;

7295,--W. S. P.,
7296,--W. S. P.,"With pleading eyes, the two stayed on her choice,"
7297,--W. S. P.,Each thinking one must win and one must lose.

7318,--W. S. P.,The following song was written for the benefit of any theatrical or
7319,--W. S. P.,musical entertainment that desires to use it in Houston. Any company
7320,--W. S. P.,"rendering it outside the city is liable to a fine of $1,000,000, as it"
7321,--W. S. P.,"has been composed solely for the pleasure of Houston audiences, which"
7322,--W. S. P.,"it is sure to please. The person singing the song, if a gent, will"
7323,--W. S. P.,"dress in loud check trousers, tan shoes, and high white hat, advancing"
7324,--W. S. P.,"to the footlights, smiling, and carrying a large cane. If sung by a"
7325,--W. S. P.,"lady, the costume is the same, with smaller checks, and parasol"

7328,--W. S. P.,last night rocking the baby to sleep. (_Laughter._) I love babies.
7329,--W. S. P.,(_Great laughter._) When they get molasses on their fingers and use your
7330,--W. S. P.,"shirt front for a piano, it makes a man think marriage is a success,"
7331,--W. S. P.,now doesn't it? (_Howls of laughter from the family circle._) Last night
7332,--W. S. P.,I came home late from the lodge (_applause_); and after I took off my
