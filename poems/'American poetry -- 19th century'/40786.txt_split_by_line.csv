37,I,Black Riders came from the sea.
38,I,"There was clang and clang of spear and shield,"
39,I,"And clash and clash of hoof and heel,"
40,I,Wild shouts and the wave of hair
41,I,In the rush upon the wind:
42,I,Thus the ride of Sin.

47,II,
48,II,Three little birds in a row
49,II,Sat musing.
50,II,A man passed near that place.
51,II,Then did the little birds nudge each other.
52,II,"They said, ""He thinks he can sing."""
53,II,"They threw back their heads to laugh,"
54,II,With quaint countenances
55,II,They regarded him.
56,II,"They were very curious,"
57,II,Those three little birds in a row.

62,III,
63,III,In the desert
64,III,"I saw a creature, naked, bestial,"
65,III,"Who, squatting upon the ground,"
66,III,"Held his heart in his hands,"
67,III,And ate of it.
68,III,"I said, ""Is it good, friend?"""
69,III,"""It is bitter--bitter,"" he answered;"
70,III,"""But I like it"
71,III,"Because it is bitter,"
72,III,"And because it is my heart."""

77,IV,
78,IV,"Yes, I have a thousand tongues,"
79,IV,And nine and ninety-nine lie.
80,IV,"Though I strive to use the one,"
81,IV,"It will make no melody at my will,"
82,IV,But is dead in my mouth.

87,V,
88,V,Once there came a man
89,V,"Who said,"
90,V,"""Range me all men of the world in rows."""
91,V,And instantly
92,V,There was terrific clamor among the people
93,V,Against being ranged in rows.
94,V,"There was a loud quarrel, world-wide."
95,V,It endured for ages;
96,V,And blood was shed
97,V,"By those who would not stand in rows,"
98,V,"And by those who pined to stand in rows,"
99,V,"Eventually, the man went to death, weeping."
100,V,And those who staid in bloody scuffle
101,V,Knew not the great simplicity.
102,V,
103,V,
104,V,
105,VI,VI
106,VI,
107,VI,God fashioned the ship of the world carefully
108,VI,With the infinite skill of an All-Master
109,VI,"Made He the hull and the sails,"
110,VI,Held He the rudder
111,VI,Ready for adjustment.
112,VI,"Erect stood He, scanning his work proudly."
113,VI,"Then--at fateful time--a Wrong called,"
114,VI,"And God turned, heeding."
115,VI,"Lo, the ship, at this opportunity, slipped slyly,"
116,VI,Making cunning noiseless travel down the ways.
117,VI,"So that, forever rudderless, it went upon the seas"
118,VI,"Going ridiculous voyages,"
119,VI,"Making quaint progress,"
120,VI,Turning as with serious purpose
121,VI,Before stupid winds.
122,VI,And there were many in the sky
123,VI,Who laughed at this thing.
124,VI,
125,VI,
126,VI,
127,VII,VII
128,VII,
129,VII,"Mystic Shadow, bending near me,"
130,VII,Who art thou?
131,VII,Whence come ye?
132,VII,And--tell me--is it fair
133,VII,Or is the truth bitter as eaten fire?
134,VII,Tell me!
135,VII,"Fear not that I should quaver,"
136,VII,For I dare--I dare.
137,VII,"Then, tell me!"
138,VII,
139,VII,
140,VII,
141,VIII,VIII
142,VIII,
143,VIII,I looked here;
144,VIII,I looked there;
145,VIII,Nowhere could I see my love.
146,VIII,And--this time--
147,VIII,She was in my heart.
148,VIII,"Truly, then, I have no complaint,"
149,VIII,"For though she be fair and fairer,"
150,VIII,She is none so fair as she
151,VIII,In my heart.
152,VIII,
153,VIII,
154,VIII,
155,IX,IX
156,IX,
157,IX,"I stood upon a high place,"
158,IX,"And saw, below, many devils"
159,IX,"Running, leaping,"
160,IX,And carousing in sin.
161,IX,"One looked up, grinning,"
162,IX,"And said, ""Comrade!  Brother!"""

164,IX,
165,IX,
166,X,X
167,X,
168,X,"Should the wide world roll away,"
169,X,"Leaving black terror,"
170,X,"Limitless night,"
171,X,"Nor God, nor man, nor place to stand"
172,X,"Would be to me essential,"
173,X,"If thou and thy white arms were there,"
174,X,And the fall to doom a long way.

179,XI,
180,XI,"In a lonely place,"
181,XI,I encountered a sage
182,XI,"Who sat, all still,"
183,XI,Regarding a newspaper.
184,XI,He accosted me:
185,XI,"""Sir, what is this?"""
186,XI,"Then I saw that I was greater,"
187,XI,"Aye, greater than this sage."
188,XI,"I answered him at once,"
189,XI,"""Old, old man, it is the wisdom of the age."""
190,XI,The sage looked upon me with admiration.
191,XI,
192,XI,
193,XI,
194,XII,XII
195,XII,
196,XII,"""and the sins of the fathers shall be"
197,XII,"visited upon the heads of the children,"
198,XII,even unto the third and fourth
199,XII,"generation of them that hate me."""
200,XII,
201,XII,"Well, then, I hate thee, Unrighteous Picture;"
202,XII,"Wicked Image, I hate thee;"
203,XII,"So, strike with thy vengeance"
204,XII,The heads of those little men
205,XII,Who come blindly.
206,XII,It will be a brave thing.
207,XII,
208,XII,
209,XII,
210,XIII,XIII
211,XIII,
212,XIII,"If there is a witness to my little life,"
213,XIII,"To my tiny throes and struggles,"
214,XIII,He sees a fool;
215,XIII,And it is not fine for gods to menace fools.
216,XIII,
217,XIII,
218,XIII,
219,XIV,XIV
220,XIV,
221,XIV,There was crimson clash of war.
222,XIV,Lands turned black and bare;
223,XIV,Women wept;
224,XIV,"Babes ran, wondering."
225,XIV,There came one who understood not these things.
226,XIV,"He said, ""Why is this?"""
227,XIV,Whereupon a million strove to answer him.
228,XIV,"There was such intricate clamor of tongues,"
229,XIV,That still the reason was not.
230,XIV,
231,XIV,
232,XIV,
233,XV,XV
234,XV,
235,XV,"""Tell brave deeds of war."""
236,XV,
237,XV,"Then they recounted tales,--"
238,XV,"""There were stern stands"
239,XV,"""And bitter runs for glory."""
240,XV,
241,XV,"Ah, I think there were braver deeds."
242,XV,
243,XV,
244,XV,
245,XVI,XVI
246,XVI,
247,XVI,"Charity, thou art a lie,"
248,XVI,"A toy of women,"
249,XVI,A pleasure of certain men.
250,XVI,"In the presence of justice,"
251,XVI,"Lo, the walls of the temple"
252,XVI,Are visible
253,XVI,Through thy form of sudden shadows.
254,XVI,
255,XVI,
256,XVI,
257,XVII,XVII
258,XVII,
259,XVII,"There were many who went in huddled procession,"
260,XVII,They knew not whither;
261,XVII,"But, at any rate, success or calamity"
262,XVII,Would attend all in equality.
263,XVII,
264,XVII,There was one who sought a new road.
265,XVII,"He went into direful thickets,"
266,XVII,"And ultimately he died thus, alone;"
267,XVII,But they said he had courage.
268,XVII,
269,XVII,
270,XVII,
271,XVIII,XVIII
272,XVIII,
273,XVIII,"In Heaven,"
274,XVIII,Some little blades of grass
275,XVIII,Stood before God.
276,XVIII,"""What did you do?"""
277,XVIII,Then all save one of the little blades
278,XVIII,Began eagerly to relate
279,XVIII,The merits of their lives.
280,XVIII,"This one stayed a small way behind,"
281,XVIII,Ashamed.
282,XVIII,"Presently, God said,"
283,XVIII,"""And what did you do?"""
284,XVIII,"The little blade answered, ""Oh, my Lord,"
285,XVIII,"""Memory is bitter to me,"
286,XVIII,"""For, if I did good deeds,"
287,XVIII,"""I know not of them."""
288,XVIII,"Then God, in all His splendor,"
289,XVIII,Arose from His throne.
290,XVIII,"""Oh, best little blade of grass!"" He said."
291,XVIII,
292,XVIII,
293,XVIII,
294,XIX,XIX
295,XIX,
296,XIX,A god in wrath
297,XIX,Was beating a man;
298,XIX,He cuffed him loudly
299,XIX,With thunderous blows
300,XIX,That rang and rolled over the earth.
301,XIX,All people came running.
302,XIX,"The man screamed and struggled,"
303,XIX,And bit madly at the feet of the god.
304,XIX,"The people cried,"
305,XIX,"""Ah, what a wicked man!"""
306,XIX,And--
307,XIX,"""Ah, what a redoubtable god!"""
308,XIX,
309,XIX,
310,XIX,
311,XX,XX
312,XX,
313,XX,A learned man came to me once.
314,XX,"He said, ""I know the way,--come."""
315,XX,And I was overjoyed at this.
316,XX,Together we hastened.
317,XX,"Soon, too soon, were we"
318,XX,"Where my eyes were useless,"
319,XX,And I knew not the ways of my feet
320,XX,I clung to the hand of my friend;
321,XX,"But at last he cried, ""I am lost."""
322,XX,
323,XX,
324,XX,
325,XXI,XXI
326,XXI,
327,XXI,"There was, before me,"
328,XXI,Mile upon mile
329,XXI,"Of snow, ice, burning sand."
330,XXI,"And yet I could look beyond all this,"
331,XXI,To a place of infinite beauty;
332,XXI,And I could see the loveliness of her
333,XXI,Who walked in the shade of the trees.
334,XXI,"When I gazed,"
335,XXI,All was lost
336,XXI,But this place of beauty and her.
337,XXI,"When I gazed,"
338,XXI,"And in my gazing, desired,"
339,XXI,Then came again
340,XXI,"Mile upon mile,"
341,XXI,"Of snow, ice, burning sand."
342,XXI,
343,XXI,
344,XXI,
345,XXII,XXII
346,XXII,
347,XXII,"Once I saw Mountains angry,"
348,XXII,And ranged in battle-front.
349,XXII,Against them stood a little man;
350,XXII,"Aye, he was no bigger than my finger."
351,XXII,"I laughed, and spoke to one near me,"
352,XXII,"""Will he prevail?"""
353,XXII,"""Surely,"" replied this other;"
354,XXII,"""His grandfathers beat them many times."""
355,XXII,"Then did I see much virtue in grandfathers,--"
356,XXII,"At least, for the little man"
357,XXII,Who stood against the Mountains.
358,XXII,
359,XXII,
360,XXII,
361,XXIII,XXIII
362,XXIII,
363,XXIII,"Places among the stars,"
364,XXIII,"Soft gardens near the sun,"
365,XXIII,Keep your distant beauty;
366,XXIII,Shed no beams upon my weak heart.
367,XXIII,Since she is here
368,XXIII,"In a place of blackness,"
369,XXIII,Not your golden days
370,XXIII,Nor your silver nights
371,XXIII,Can call me to you.
372,XXIII,Since she is here
373,XXIII,"In a place of blackness,"
374,XXIII,Here I stay and wait.
375,XXIII,
376,XXIII,
377,XXIII,
378,XXIV,XXIV
379,XXIV,
380,XXIV,I saw a man pursuing the horizon;
381,XXIV,Round and round they sped.
382,XXIV,I was disturbed at this;
383,XXIV,I accosted the man.
384,XXIV,"""It is futile,"" I said,"
385,XXIV,"""You can never""--"
386,XXIV,
387,XXIV,"""You lie,"" he cried,"
388,XXIV,And ran on.
389,XXIV,
390,XXIV,
391,XXIV,
392,XXV,XXV
393,XXV,
394,XXV,"Behold, the grave of a wicked man,"
395,XXV,"And near it, a stern spirit."
396,XXV,
397,XXV,"There came a drooping maid with violets,"
398,XXV,But the spirit grasped her arm.
399,XXV,"""No flowers for him,"" he said."
400,XXV,The maid wept:
401,XXV,"""Ah, I loved him."""
402,XXV,"But the spirit, grim and frowning:"
403,XXV,"""No flowers for him."""
404,XXV,
405,XXV,"Now, this is it--"
406,XXV,"If the spirit was just,"
407,XXV,Why did the maid weep?
408,XXV,
409,XXV,
410,XXV,
411,XXVI,XXVI
412,XXVI,
413,XXVI,"There was set before me a mighty hill,"
414,XXVI,And long days I climbed
415,XXVI,Through regions of snow.
416,XXVI,"When I had before me the summit-view,"
417,XXVI,It seemed that my labor
418,XXVI,Had been to see gardens
419,XXVI,Lying at impossible distances.
420,XXVI,
421,XXVI,
422,XXVI,
423,XXVII,XXVII
424,XXVII,
425,XXVII,A youth in apparel that glittered
426,XXVII,Went to walk in a grim forest.
427,XXVII,There he met an assassin
428,XXVII,Attired all in garb of old days;
429,XXVII,"He, scowling through the thickets,"
430,XXVII,"And dagger poised quivering,"
431,XXVII,Rushed upon the youth.
432,XXVII,"""Sir,"" said this latter,"
433,XXVII,"""I am enchanted, believe me,"
434,XXVII,"""To die, thus,"
435,XXVII,"""In this medieval fashion,"
436,XXVII,"""According to the best legends;"
437,XXVII,"""Ah, what joy!"""
438,XXVII,"Then took he the wound, smiling,"
439,XXVII,"And died, content."
440,XXVII,
441,XXVII,
442,XXVII,
443,XXVIII,XXVIII
444,XXVIII,
445,XXVIII,"""Truth,"" said a traveller,"
446,XXVIII,"""Is a rock, a mighty fortress;"
447,XXVIII,"""Often have I been to it,"
448,XXVIII,"""Even to its highest tower,"
449,XXVIII,"""From whence the world looks black."""
450,XXVIII,
451,XXVIII,"""Truth,"" said a traveller,"
452,XXVIII,"""Is a breath, a wind,"
453,XXVIII,"""A shadow, a phantom;"
454,XXVIII,"""Long have I pursued it,"
455,XXVIII,"""But never have I touched"
456,XXVIII,"""The hem of its garment."""
457,XXVIII,
458,XXVIII,And I believed the second traveller;
459,XXVIII,For truth was to me
460,XXVIII,"A breath, a wind,"
461,XXVIII,"A shadow, a phantom,"
462,XXVIII,And never had I touched
463,XXVIII,The hem of its garment.
464,XXVIII,
465,XXVIII,
466,XXVIII,
467,XXIX,XXIX
468,XXIX,
469,XXIX,"Behold, from the land of the farther suns"
470,XXIX,I returned.
471,XXIX,"And I was in a reptile-swarming place,"
472,XXIX,"Peopled, otherwise, with grimaces,"
473,XXIX,Shrouded above in black impenetrableness.
474,XXIX,"I shrank, loathing,"
475,XXIX,Sick with it.
476,XXIX,"And I said to him,"
477,XXIX,"""What is this?"""
478,XXIX,"He made answer slowly,"
479,XXIX,"""Spirit, this is a world;"
480,XXIX,"""This was your home."""
481,XXIX,
482,XXIX,
483,XXIX,
484,XXX,XXX
485,XXX,
486,XXX,Supposing that I should have the courage
487,XXX,To let a red sword of virtue
488,XXX,"Plunge into my heart,"
489,XXX,Letting to the weeds of the ground
490,XXX,"My sinful blood,"
491,XXX,What can you offer me?
492,XXX,A gardened castle?
493,XXX,A flowery kingdom?
494,XXX,
495,XXX,What?  A hope?
496,XXX,Then hence with your red sword of virtue.
497,XXX,
498,XXX,
499,XXX,
500,XXXI,XXXI
501,XXXI,
502,XXXI,Many workmen
503,XXXI,Built a huge ball of masonry
504,XXXI,Upon a mountain-top.
505,XXXI,"Then they went to the valley below,"
506,XXXI,And turned to behold their work.
507,XXXI,"""It is grand,"" they said;"
508,XXXI,They loved the thing.
509,XXXI,
510,XXXI,"Of a sudden, it moved:"
511,XXXI,It came upon them swiftly;
512,XXXI,It crushed them all to blood.
513,XXXI,But some had opportunity to squeal.
514,XXXI,
515,XXXI,
516,XXXI,
517,XXXII,XXXII
518,XXXII,
519,XXXII,Two or three angels
520,XXXII,Came near to the earth.
521,XXXII,They saw a fat church.
522,XXXII,Little black streams of people
523,XXXII,Came and went in continually.
524,XXXII,And the angels were puzzled
525,XXXII,"To know why the people went thus,"
526,XXXII,And why they stayed so long within.
527,XXXII,
528,XXXII,
529,XXXII,
530,XXXIII,XXXIII
531,XXXIII,
532,XXXIII,There was one I met upon the road
533,XXXIII,Who looked at me with kind eyes.
534,XXXIII,"He said, ""Show me of your wares."""
535,XXXIII,"And this I did,"
536,XXXIII,Holding forth one.
537,XXXIII,"He said, ""It is a sin."""
538,XXXIII,Then held I forth another;
539,XXXIII,"He said, ""It is a sin."""
540,XXXIII,Then held I forth another;
541,XXXIII,"He said, ""It is a sin."""
542,XXXIII,And so to the end;
543,XXXIII,"Always he said, ""It is a sin."""
544,XXXIII,"And, finally, I cried out,"
545,XXXIII,"""But I have none other."""
546,XXXIII,Then did he look at me
547,XXXIII,With kinder eyes.
548,XXXIII,"""Poor soul!"" he said."
549,XXXIII,
550,XXXIII,
551,XXXIII,
552,XXXIV,XXXIV
553,XXXIV,
554,XXXIV,"I stood upon a highway,"
555,XXXIV,"And, behold, there came"
556,XXXIV,Many strange pedlers.
557,XXXIV,To me each one made gestures.
558,XXXIV,"Holding forth little images, saying,"
559,XXXIV,"""This is my pattern of God."
560,XXXIV,"""Now this is the God I prefer."""
561,XXXIV,
562,XXXIV,"But I said, ""Hence!"
563,XXXIV,"""Leave me with mine own,"
564,XXXIV,"""And take you yours away;"
565,XXXIV,"""I can’t buy of your patterns of God,"
566,XXXIV,"""The little Gods you may rightly prefer."""

568,XXXIV,
569,XXXIV,
570,XXXV,XXXV
571,XXXV,
572,XXXV,A man saw a ball of gold in the sky;
573,XXXV,"He climbed for it,"
574,XXXV,And eventually he achieved it--
575,XXXV,It was clay.
576,XXXV,
577,XXXV,Now this is the strange part:
578,XXXV,When the man went to the earth
579,XXXV,"And looked again,"
580,XXXV,"Lo, there was the ball of gold."
581,XXXV,Now this is the strange part:
582,XXXV,It was a ball of gold.
583,XXXV,"Aye, by the Heavens, it was a ball of gold."
584,XXXV,
585,XXXV,
586,XXXV,
587,XXXVI,XXXVI
588,XXXVI,
589,XXXVI,I met a seer.
590,XXXVI,He held in his hands
591,XXXVI,The book of wisdom.
592,XXXVI,"""Sir,"" I addressed him,"
593,XXXVI,"""Let me read."""
594,XXXVI,"""Child--"" he began."
595,XXXVI,"""Sir,"" I said,"
596,XXXVI,"""Think not that I am a child,"

1159,LXVII,"But of all sadness this was sad,--"

1161,LXVII,The head of a sleeping man
1162,LXVII,From the jaws of the final beast.

1172,LXVIII,He went through valleys
1173,LXVIII,"Of black death-slime,"
1174,LXVIII,"Ever calling,"
1175,LXVIII,"""God!  God!"""

1181,LXVIII,"He went, ever calling,"
1182,LXVIII,"""God!  God!"""

1189,LXVIII,"Smote him,"
1190,LXVIII,And he was dead.
