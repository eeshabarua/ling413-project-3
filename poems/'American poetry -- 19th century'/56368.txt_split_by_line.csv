101,ADVERTISEMENT.,"The treaty of Ghent, concluded in the autumn of 1814, terminated the"
102,ADVERTISEMENT.,"contest then existing between the United States and Great Britain,"
103,ADVERTISEMENT.,although it was not promulgated in time to arrest one of the severest
104,ADVERTISEMENT.,"battles of the war. In this contest, as in all prior ones of a general"
105,ADVERTISEMENT.,"character, subsequent to the settlement of European nations in the new"
106,ADVERTISEMENT.,"world, the native tribes were deeply involved. Indeed, it was under the"
107,ADVERTISEMENT.,"influence of an extraordinary prophetic delusion, that it may be said"
108,ADVERTISEMENT.,"to have commenced, on their part, on the plains of Tippecanoe."
109,ADVERTISEMENT.,
110,ADVERTISEMENT.,If the opening of this renewed struggle for supremacy by the aborigines
111,ADVERTISEMENT.,"in 1811, on the banks of the Wabash, had the effect to bring on the"
112,ADVERTISEMENT.,"stage of action a noted warrior, in the person of Tecumthe,[1] who"
113,ADVERTISEMENT.,"certainly has had few equals as a military and political leader,"
114,ADVERTISEMENT.,since the era of the prior stand made by the American tribes under
115,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Pontiac; its onward events, and its, to them, disastrous close, drew"
116,ADVERTISEMENT.,"into prominent notice a scarcely less remarkable, and in some traits"
117,ADVERTISEMENT.,"superior, character, under the name of Tuscaloosa, or the Black"
118,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Warrior. This man, from his personal courage, skill, and activity,"
119,ADVERTISEMENT.,"absorbed the full confidence of his tribe; and to him was, in effect,"
120,ADVERTISEMENT.,"committed the cause of the Indian war in the south, until the date of"
121,ADVERTISEMENT.,"his voluntary personal surrender to the American commander, after the"
122,ADVERTISEMENT.,"power of his nation had been crushed in a series of sanguinary battles,"
123,ADVERTISEMENT.,and a price set upon his head.
124,ADVERTISEMENT.,
125,ADVERTISEMENT.,"It was the race of the Muscogees, who, under the popular name of"
126,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Creeks, opposed the most strenuous opposition to the arms of the United"
127,ADVERTISEMENT.,"States. This nation, in its numerous clans and subdivisions, were, at"
128,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the period, strong in their numbers, and confident in their strength."
129,ADVERTISEMENT.,"These clans, influenced and misled by foreign counsel, were seated"
130,ADVERTISEMENT.,"in their original vallies, forests, and fastnesses, in the remoter"
131,ADVERTISEMENT.,"slopes and spurs of the Southern Alleghanies, stretching towards the"
132,ADVERTISEMENT.,"gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi, but were found to have their chief"
133,ADVERTISEMENT.,"point of military supply in Florida, then under the dominion of Spain,"
134,ADVERTISEMENT.,into which the operations of the war were eventually and necessarily
135,ADVERTISEMENT.,"transferred. It was in this manner that the Seminoles, who have since"
136,ADVERTISEMENT.,"made so protracted a stand, first drew upon themselves the force of the"
137,ADVERTISEMENT.,American arms.
138,ADVERTISEMENT.,
139,ADVERTISEMENT.,"The present tale, in which fiction builds itself upon these general"
140,ADVERTISEMENT.,"facts, turns upon the contest of the Muscogees, their exertions, their"
141,ADVERTISEMENT.,"discomfitures, and their final fall. It opens at a distant point, many"
142,ADVERTISEMENT.,"degrees towards the north, within a short period after the close of"
143,ADVERTISEMENT.,the Creek war. It occupies two days and two nights in its action. The
144,ADVERTISEMENT.,"idea here brought forward of uniting or intermingling the dramatic,"
145,ADVERTISEMENT.,"with the narrative and descriptive, is believed to be well adapted to"
146,ADVERTISEMENT.,"topics of this character, in which the natural bent of the natives"
147,ADVERTISEMENT.,"for declamation and mystic romance may be indulged, while the time"
148,ADVERTISEMENT.,"of the action, it is conceived, may be thereby curtailed, and verbal"
149,ADVERTISEMENT.,description retrenched. The measure is thought to be not ill adapted
150,ADVERTISEMENT.,to the Indian mode of enunciation. Nothing is more characteristic of
151,ADVERTISEMENT.,"their harangues and public speeches, than that vehement, yet broken and"
152,ADVERTISEMENT.,"continued strain of utterance, which would be subject to the charge of"
153,ADVERTISEMENT.,"monotony, were it not varied by an extraordinary compass in the stress"
154,ADVERTISEMENT.,"of voice, broken by the repetition of high and low accent, and often"
155,ADVERTISEMENT.,"terminated with an exclamatory vigor, which is sometimes startling."
156,ADVERTISEMENT.,"It is not the less in accordance with these traits, that nearly every"
157,ADVERTISEMENT.,"initial syllable of the measure chosen, is under accent. This at least"
158,ADVERTISEMENT.,"may be affirmed, that it imparts a movement to the narrative, which, at"
159,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the same time that it obviates languor, favors that repetitious rhythm,"
160,ADVERTISEMENT.,"or pseudo-parallelism, which so strongly marks their highly compound"
161,ADVERTISEMENT.,lexicography.
162,ADVERTISEMENT.,
163,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Of the theme itself, nothing further is requisite to be said. The"
164,ADVERTISEMENT.,"tale was written, as it now stands, in 1826, with a few exceptions of"
165,ADVERTISEMENT.,"earlier date; and it may be added, that it was among the _agremens_"
166,ADVERTISEMENT.,"of the writer’s seclusion, while he was living in a public capacity,"
167,ADVERTISEMENT.,"within the impressive scenes, and among the manly tribes, in the lake"
168,ADVERTISEMENT.,region described. That its publication should have been deferred until
169,ADVERTISEMENT.,the author had seen cause to resume the original orthography of the
170,ADVERTISEMENT.,"initial syllable of his patronymic name, may render it proper further"
171,ADVERTISEMENT.,"to add, in this connection, that the change from School, and resumption"
172,ADVERTISEMENT.,"of Col, in the adjective syllable of the name, is in strict conformity"
173,ADVERTISEMENT.,"with family tradition, supported by recent observation in England. In"
174,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the latter country, however, the name is uniformly written Cal, however"
175,ADVERTISEMENT.,it may be pronounced.

178,ADVERTISEMENT.,orthography of Tecumseh—which is not true Shawanoe.

1209,ALHALLA.,"Of one small tittle of the truth,"

1211,ALHALLA.,And rack of slow-consuming fire.
1212,ALHALLA.,"When erst this cloud obdurate rose,"
1213,ALHALLA.,"Red with the wrath of many foes,"
1214,ALHALLA.,"And men and steeds promiscuous slain,"
1215,ALHALLA.,"Strewed Tallasatche’s fatal plain,"

1217,ALHALLA.,Perched on the standards floating there!
1218,ALHALLA.,"I, on that sanguinary day,"
1219,ALHALLA.,"Mixed freely in the dubious fray,"
1220,ALHALLA.,"And with my war-axe, lance and brand,"
1221,ALHALLA.,Fought with the foremost of my band.

1224,ALHALLA.,"But vain was every warrior art,"
1225,ALHALLA.,"By charge or war-whoop, club or dart;"
1226,ALHALLA.,"The foeman pressing on our ground,"
1227,ALHALLA.,"With horse and bayonet wall’d us round,"
1228,ALHALLA.,"And with fierce courage bearing down,"
1229,ALHALLA.,"Swept plain and covert, host and town,"
1230,ALHALLA.,"And nine score warriors, whom I led,"
1231,ALHALLA.,Upon that day lay cold and dead.
1232,ALHALLA.,
1233,ALHALLA.,"Few suns set on that dismal scene,"
1234,ALHALLA.,"My wounds were still unsear’d and green,"
1235,ALHALLA.,"When thundering on with trump and drum,"
1236,ALHALLA.,"I heard again the war-horse come,"
1237,ALHALLA.,"Like gathering tempest, big and black,"
1238,ALHALLA.,"That through the forest wings its track,"
1239,ALHALLA.,"Sweeping and tearing all that stand,"
1240,ALHALLA.,And desolating wood and land.
1241,ALHALLA.,"But I had oft seen danger near,"
1242,ALHALLA.,And knew not that base feeling—fear!
1243,ALHALLA.,I roused my warriors from the rest
1244,ALHALLA.,"That with short, fitful dreams they prest,"
1245,ALHALLA.,"And armed for fight, and strife and pain,"
1246,ALHALLA.,Stood firm on Talladega’s plain.
1247,ALHALLA.,Oh Talladega! thou art still
1248,ALHALLA.,My native wood! my native hill!
1249,ALHALLA.,"There knew I first my father’s voice,"
1250,ALHALLA.,"And felt my infant mind rejoice,"
1251,ALHALLA.,"And all those sweet endearments start,"
1252,ALHALLA.,"That nature winds about the heart,"
1253,ALHALLA.,"And home, and love, and bliss, and fame,"
1254,ALHALLA.,That cluster round a parent’s name.
1255,ALHALLA.,"And there I hoped to live and die,"
1256,ALHALLA.,In nature’s sweet simplicity;
1257,ALHALLA.,"Unmov’d with arts, or cares, or strife,"
1258,ALHALLA.,That mingle in the white man’s life;
1259,ALHALLA.,"Nor knew I whence th’ intruder came,"
1260,ALHALLA.,"Nor what his race, or what his fame;"
1261,ALHALLA.,"Nor car’d, nor wish’d, nor sought to be"
1262,ALHALLA.,Else than I was—a Hillabee.
1263,ALHALLA.,"And still I hoped, when nature threw"
1264,ALHALLA.,"Around my brows the silver hue,"
1265,ALHALLA.,And fainting limbs proclaimed the close
1266,ALHALLA.,"Of earthly cares and earthly woes,"
1267,ALHALLA.,"To lay me down with sober care,"
1268,ALHALLA.,And slumber with my fathers there.
1269,ALHALLA.,"Ah! land of all my heart holds dear,"
1270,ALHALLA.,Thy groves are desolate and sear—
1271,ALHALLA.,The echoes of thy winding shore
1272,ALHALLA.,Shall charm my listening ear no more—
1273,ALHALLA.,The winds that whistle o’er thy plain
1274,ALHALLA.,"Repeat a sad and hollow strain,"
1275,ALHALLA.,"And all thy haunts are fill’d with moans,"
1276,ALHALLA.,And whitened by my nation’s bones.
1277,ALHALLA.,
1278,ALHALLA.,But let me drop this strain of woe:
1279,ALHALLA.,"I told thee of the coming foe,"
1280,ALHALLA.,"And he did come, in such array"
1281,ALHALLA.,As well foretold a stubborn day.
1282,ALHALLA.,"Few words I spoke to those who stood,"
1283,ALHALLA.,"With ready arms, within that wood;"
1284,ALHALLA.,"But, when I ceas’d, the battle cry"
1285,ALHALLA.,Rung long and loudly—strike or die!
1286,ALHALLA.,"Erst trampling horse, in armor bright,"
1287,ALHALLA.,"Pricked to the front and wooed the fight,"
1288,ALHALLA.,With volley quick and furious tread
1289,ALHALLA.,"Essayed th’ assault, and, wheeling, fled."
1290,ALHALLA.,"I forward sprang, and at one yell"
1291,ALHALLA.,"A thousand warriors served me well,"
1292,ALHALLA.,"And urging ball and feather’d dart,"
1293,ALHALLA.,Play’d hot and strong the warrior’s part;
1294,ALHALLA.,And once I drove the reeling ranks
1295,ALHALLA.,"Back on their chief—the chief outflanks,"
1296,ALHALLA.,"Pours from behind his galling horse,"
1297,ALHALLA.,And opes the war with all his force.
1298,ALHALLA.,Thick round my sides my bowmen lie—
1299,ALHALLA.,"They faint, they waver, and they fly;"
1300,ALHALLA.,Then streams afresh the battle gore
1301,ALHALLA.,"Wider and wider along the shore,"
1302,ALHALLA.,And those who fly but fly to feel
1303,ALHALLA.,Th’ avenging horsemen’s angry steel.
1304,ALHALLA.,"And when the night closed on that plain,"
1305,ALHALLA.,"To veil the dying and the slain,"
1306,ALHALLA.,"Few, out of all my gallant band,"
1307,ALHALLA.,Had ’scaped the mark of ball or brand;
1308,ALHALLA.,"And death, of brave Muscogee men,"
1309,ALHALLA.,Had numbered fourteen score and ten.

1325,ALHALLA.,"Not as it wont, in glory bright,"
1326,ALHALLA.,"But veil’d in clouds of sombre trace,"
1327,ALHALLA.,Prophetic of my falling race.
1328,ALHALLA.,"I stood upon a rising ground,"
1329,ALHALLA.,"As darkness flung her mantle round,"
1330,ALHALLA.,"And heard the last, departing din,"
1331,ALHALLA.,"Of horse and footmen, gathering in,"

1333,ALHALLA.,"As from the onset they withdrew,"

1337,ALHALLA.,"Of hapless comrade, weltering near:"
1338,ALHALLA.,"For all that wide, extended wood,"
1339,ALHALLA.,"Was strewed with carnage, death and blood."
1340,ALHALLA.,"I stood as petrified, with thought"
1341,ALHALLA.,On all one fleeting day had wrought—
1342,ALHALLA.,Of friend and foe—the brave and dead—
1343,ALHALLA.,"And those who fought, and those who fled;"
1344,ALHALLA.,And bitter were the pangs that came
1345,ALHALLA.,That hour within my inmost frame:
1346,ALHALLA.,"For I had seen a father slain,"
1347,ALHALLA.,A father old in years and pain;
1348,ALHALLA.,"Two brothers stricken at my side,"
1349,ALHALLA.,"And a fond parent’s dearest pride,"
1350,ALHALLA.,"The child hope shone most brightly on,"
1351,ALHALLA.,"My loved, my first-born, only son!"
1352,ALHALLA.,"In grief absorbed and musing high,"
1353,ALHALLA.,And yet no tear escaped my eye—
1354,ALHALLA.,No sigh my bosom heaved—no moan
1355,ALHALLA.,Bespoke my heart’s forsaken tone;
1356,ALHALLA.,"But sealed in woe, within that wood,"
1357,ALHALLA.,Unmoved as storm-beat rock I stood.
1358,ALHALLA.,
1359,ALHALLA.,"The moon, in pity veiled that night,"
1360,ALHALLA.,"Shed out a transitory light,"
1361,ALHALLA.,"As dusky clouds, in rapid chase,"
1362,ALHALLA.,"Now hid, and now revealed her face;"
1363,ALHALLA.,"And by her feeble, trembling ray,"
1364,ALHALLA.,I took my solitary way—
1365,ALHALLA.,"The narrow, winding, leaf-clad road,"
1366,ALHALLA.,Conducting to my own abode—
1367,ALHALLA.,"The fragile shed, that, low and poor,"
1368,ALHALLA.,So oft hath made me feel secure;
1369,ALHALLA.,So oft hath spread its sheathing wild
1370,ALHALLA.,To guard the mother and the child;
1371,ALHALLA.,"That shed, which, howsoe’er he roam,"
1372,ALHALLA.,Still forms the Indian warrior’s home—
1373,ALHALLA.,"And which he would not change, or give,"
1374,ALHALLA.,"Like Briton, Scot, or Gaul to live,"
1375,ALHALLA.,"For all the wealth that kings command,"
1376,ALHALLA.,Or temples made with mortal hand.
1377,ALHALLA.,
1378,ALHALLA.,"Brief space I walked, when, turning round"
1379,ALHALLA.,"A beetling rock that walled the ground,"
1380,ALHALLA.,"And just o’erhung my lodge, there fell"
1381,ALHALLA.,Sounds on my ear I knew not well;
1382,ALHALLA.,A murmur indistinct—and then
1383,ALHALLA.,"The harsh, brief words of stranger men."
1384,ALHALLA.,A pause ensued—shriek! I sped
1385,ALHALLA.,"To guard my lowly, leaf-crowned shed,"
1386,ALHALLA.,"And saw, with deeply rous’d alarms,"
1387,ALHALLA.,My Ednee in a soldier’s arms
1388,ALHALLA.,"Borne shrieking off, in accents wild,"
1389,ALHALLA.,"‘Oh, father! save thy injured child!’"
1390,ALHALLA.,What space there was ’twixt him that bore
1391,ALHALLA.,"And my own stand upon the shore,"
1392,ALHALLA.,"Ill can I vouch—but, wide or spare,"
1393,ALHALLA.,One instant served to waft me there.
1394,ALHALLA.,I raised one yell my warriors knew—
1395,ALHALLA.,"For I had warriors still, and true—"
1396,ALHALLA.,"Then sprang, and drew, and smote with might,"
1397,ALHALLA.,And still the plunderers answered—smite!
1398,ALHALLA.,"And still those thrilling accents wild,"
1399,ALHALLA.,"Rung in my ears—“Oh, save thy child!”"
1400,ALHALLA.,"Vain cry! outnumbered, hand to hand"
1401,ALHALLA.,"I felt the foeman’s heavy brand,"
1402,ALHALLA.,"And reeled to earth—and bleeding there,"
1403,ALHALLA.,"I felt unutt’rable despair,"
1404,ALHALLA.,"For still I heard that plaint so wild,"
1405,ALHALLA.,"“Oh, father! save thy injured child!”"
1406,ALHALLA.,
1407,ALHALLA.,As hungry panther from his tree
1408,ALHALLA.,"Darts on his victim, bold and free,"
1409,ALHALLA.,"Or black crotalis, ere he spring,"
1410,ALHALLA.,"Gives warning of the deadly sting,"
1411,ALHALLA.,Thus swift and sure in strength and mood
1412,ALHALLA.,"Ten warriors leapt from out the wood,"
1413,ALHALLA.,"Upon the instant when, with pain,"
1414,ALHALLA.,I sank upon the dewy plain;
1415,ALHALLA.,"Each armed with arms of steel and dread,"
1416,ALHALLA.,"With brave Clewalla at their head,"
1417,ALHALLA.,"And at one shout, and at one bound,"
1418,ALHALLA.,They shake the trembling woods around.
1419,ALHALLA.,"They fight—they vanquish! words are vain,"
1420,ALHALLA.,They bring me safe my child again.
1421,ALHALLA.,"What boots it, that I here should tell,"
1422,ALHALLA.,"Or those who ’scap’d, or those who fell?"
1423,ALHALLA.,"Th’ assailants, merged in margin damp"
1424,ALHALLA.,"And tangled brushwood, sought their camp."
1425,ALHALLA.,"Of those who fell, a liquid grave"
1426,ALHALLA.,We gave in Coosa’s yellow wave;
1427,ALHALLA.,"Which, soft and slow, and winding, bore"
1428,ALHALLA.,Its charge to ocean’s sand-bound shore.
1429,ALHALLA.,Now sober silence once again
1430,ALHALLA.,Began to hold her wonted reign;
1431,ALHALLA.,"My wounds, with simple skill, were bound,"
1432,ALHALLA.,"My warriors lay reclining round,"
1433,ALHALLA.,"And ere the hour of midnight chill,"
1434,ALHALLA.,"All seemed as dreary, hush’d, and still,"
1435,ALHALLA.,"As if the shout, or battle’s roar,"
1436,ALHALLA.,Had ne’er been heard upon that shore.
1437,ALHALLA.,
1438,ALHALLA.,"I sat within my tent, and mused,"
1439,ALHALLA.,"(As oft in peaceful days I used,)"
1440,ALHALLA.,"Upon the Spirit, great and high,"
1441,ALHALLA.,"That rules the earth, the sea, the sky,"
1442,ALHALLA.,And that mysterious power and will
1443,ALHALLA.,"That warrants man still man to kill,"
1444,ALHALLA.,"Sends powers and nations to and fro,"
1445,ALHALLA.,And fills the earth with strife and woe.
1446,ALHALLA.,"I thought upon my own wild kin,"
1447,ALHALLA.,"And all their wand’rings, want, and sin,"
1448,ALHALLA.,"And that untoward fate that gave,"
1449,ALHALLA.,"Profuse, their bodies to the grave,"
1450,ALHALLA.,"And seemed to set them in array,"
1451,ALHALLA.,For Saxon arms to drive and slay.
1452,ALHALLA.,"I cast my eye in thought profound,"
1453,ALHALLA.,"On that dear circle slumb’ring round,"
1454,ALHALLA.,And mark’d th’ unoccupied recess
1455,ALHALLA.,"A son, a father, once could press;"
1456,ALHALLA.,And last bethought me of the fate
1457,ALHALLA.,And juncture of my own estate:
1458,ALHALLA.,"Weak, wounded, foiled, and sore distrest—"
1459,ALHALLA.,Of friends bereav’d—by foemen prest—
1460,ALHALLA.,"Sad, bitter thoughts my heart control,"
1461,ALHALLA.,"A dreamy madness steeps my soul,"
1462,ALHALLA.,"Or wake or sleeping wist I not,"
1463,ALHALLA.,"By whom environ’d, whom forgot;"
1464,ALHALLA.,"Unreal scenes before me rise,"
1465,ALHALLA.,And visions pass before my eyes.
1466,ALHALLA.,"Methought I looked upon the sea,"
1467,ALHALLA.,"And low, dark waves, not large nor free,"
1468,ALHALLA.,"Came rolling in towards the shore,"
1469,ALHALLA.,"With scarce a pebble dash, or roar,"
1470,ALHALLA.,"Then larger grew, and louder sound,"
1471,ALHALLA.,Till one wide tumult rings around.
1472,ALHALLA.,"I looked again—a monster bear,"
1473,ALHALLA.,"With claws of steel, and fiery hair,"
1474,ALHALLA.,"Emerged from out the deep—his head,"
1475,ALHALLA.,"Two polished horns of brass o’erspread,"
1476,ALHALLA.,"And at his side a leader stood,"
1477,ALHALLA.,"Of visage pale,—a full-plum’d hood"
1478,ALHALLA.,"Danced o’er his brows, and in his hand"
1479,ALHALLA.,He held a sharp and shining brand.
1480,ALHALLA.,"I looked again, and from a tree,"
1481,ALHALLA.,A beauteous bird sang joyfully;
1482,ALHALLA.,A ray of light from either eye
1483,ALHALLA.,"Shot forth in bright tranquillity,"
1484,ALHALLA.,"Illuminating all the wood,"
1485,ALHALLA.,Within whose ample disk I stood.
1486,ALHALLA.,Yet once again my view I cast;
1487,ALHALLA.,Another changing vision past:
1488,ALHALLA.,"A fleecy cloud came from its height,"
1489,ALHALLA.,"And stood before my wond’ring sight,"
1490,ALHALLA.,"And parting, like two banners drawn,"
1491,ALHALLA.,"A figure stept upon the lawn,"
1492,ALHALLA.,"In size, and color, dress and air"
1493,ALHALLA.,Like my own kindred—but more fair.
1494,ALHALLA.,"I, wondering much what these should bode,"
1495,ALHALLA.,"Put question meet—he answer’d—“God,"
1496,ALHALLA.,"Whom once thy sires, on burning sands,"
1497,ALHALLA.,In other years and other lands
1498,ALHALLA.,"Most truly served, hath doomed thy race"
1499,ALHALLA.,"To melt before the white-man’s face,"
1500,ALHALLA.,"To fail in battle, and in store,"
1501,ALHALLA.,A scorn—a by-word on the shore;
1502,ALHALLA.,"For ye from his commands have turn’d,"
1503,ALHALLA.,"And ye unholy fires have burn’d,"
1504,ALHALLA.,And with new altars and abodes
1505,ALHALLA.,"Set up and worship’d other gods,"
1506,ALHALLA.,"And through unholy rites and sin,"
1507,ALHALLA.,In word and deed become unclean;
1508,ALHALLA.,And for a season he hath given
1509,ALHALLA.,"Your nations to the wrath of heaven,"
1510,ALHALLA.,"By divers men from foreign climes,"
1511,ALHALLA.,"Who loathe your waywardness and crimes,"
1512,ALHALLA.,And congregate from far and near
1513,ALHALLA.,To worship God in spirit here.”
1514,ALHALLA.,
1515,ALHALLA.,"’Tis well, I said; but tell me true,"
1516,ALHALLA.,What bodes this vision to my view?
1517,ALHALLA.,"It comes with a prophetic air,"
1518,ALHALLA.,But can I see the Red Race there?
1519,ALHALLA.,"“The little waves which erst thou spy’d,"
1520,ALHALLA.,"Calm and unruffled,” he replied,"
1521,ALHALLA.,"“Denote the earliest flag unfurl’d,"
1522,ALHALLA.,Advent’rous in this western world;
1523,ALHALLA.,"Whence gaining strength, in heart and hand,"
1524,ALHALLA.,"The stranger spreads along the strand,"
1525,ALHALLA.,"Like tumbling waves, whose onward way"
1526,ALHALLA.,No human force can check or stay.
1527,ALHALLA.,"The monster rising from the sea,"
1528,ALHALLA.,Imports dominion—once by thee
1529,ALHALLA.,"In peace and war triumphant sway’d,"
1530,ALHALLA.,But now to other hands convey’d;
1531,ALHALLA.,"His horns of brass and claws of steel,"
1532,ALHALLA.,A more obdurate power reveal;
1533,ALHALLA.,"His altered, red and fiery hair,"
1534,ALHALLA.,"Denotes unnumbered means of war,"
1535,ALHALLA.,"Complex inventions, sharp and true,"
1536,ALHALLA.,"Such as thy fathers never knew,"
1537,ALHALLA.,"Whereby the rule at first he gains,"
1538,ALHALLA.,And then with growing power maintains;
1539,ALHALLA.,"The leader is that iron race,"
1540,ALHALLA.,"Who drive thee on, from place to place,"
1541,ALHALLA.,"And long have driv’n, and long shall drive,"
1542,ALHALLA.,"The waning, scattered, Indian hive,"
1543,ALHALLA.,"Till they forsake th’accursed road,"
1544,ALHALLA.,"And turn to virtue, peace, and God."
1545,ALHALLA.,"Then shall they quit the forest gloom,"
1546,ALHALLA.,"The sceptre and the plough resume,"
1547,ALHALLA.,"Renounce all base, revengeful ires,"
1548,ALHALLA.,"Rebuild the altars, light the fires,"
1549,ALHALLA.,And cherish every sweet employ
1550,ALHALLA.,"Denoted by the bird of joy,"
1551,ALHALLA.,"Whose beaming eyes, with stellar light,"
1552,ALHALLA.,"Shall chase away barbaric night,"
1553,ALHALLA.,And teach thy race in holy lays
1554,ALHALLA.,To sing the great Elohim’s praise.”

1743,ALHALLA.,"Nor deigned they—when they felt th’ attack,"
1744,ALHALLA.,With all its missile horror black!
1745,ALHALLA.,"To raise a lance—or draw a bow,"
1746,ALHALLA.,Or supplicate th’ infuriate foe;
1747,ALHALLA.,Or break that honest pledge of faith
1748,ALHALLA.,"Once given: but calmly meeting death,"
1749,ALHALLA.,"There brave as noble martyrs stood,"
1750,ALHALLA.,"Nor shed one drop of foeman’s blood,"

1777,ALHALLA.,And all to peace my hopes I turn’d.
1778,ALHALLA.,"Old as I was, and weak and scarr’d,"

1780,ALHALLA.,"At night or noon, in bed or field,"
1781,ALHALLA.,"The prisoned spark of life to yield,"
1782,ALHALLA.,"And leave to those with vigor rife,"
1783,ALHALLA.,"Its sweets and sorrows, joys and strife."
1784,ALHALLA.,"One wish alone inspir’d my breast,"
1785,ALHALLA.,It was to see my Ednee blest.
1786,ALHALLA.,
1787,ALHALLA.,"And now, around my cottage fire"
1788,ALHALLA.,"Due care the festive rites require,"
1789,ALHALLA.,For oft had bold Clewalla sued
1790,ALHALLA.,"Alliance with my ancient blood,"
1791,ALHALLA.,"And with meet gifts and parlance bland,"
1792,ALHALLA.,Implored my Ednee’s timid hand;
1793,ALHALLA.,But ne’er before—that gentle claim
1794,ALHALLA.,"Enforced in fame and valour’s name,"
1795,ALHALLA.,"For now in the same person blend,"
1796,ALHALLA.,"The swain, deliverer and friend."
1797,ALHALLA.,"But still, a cruel fate in this,"
1798,ALHALLA.,"Pervades, and mars the cup of bliss!"
1799,ALHALLA.,And while the gallant warrior stands
1800,ALHALLA.,"Expectant—at my willing hands,"
1801,ALHALLA.,"A sudden tumult wild and high,"
1802,ALHALLA.,Rings fearfully along the sky—
1803,ALHALLA.,"“A foe—a foe!” the runners shout,"
1804,ALHALLA.,"And all is hurry, whoop, and rout!"
1805,ALHALLA.,
1806,ALHALLA.,Short space there is for look or word—
1807,ALHALLA.,"The warriors, with one spirit stirr’d,"
1808,ALHALLA.,"Seize club and bow, and fusil light,"
1809,ALHALLA.,And fly towards the gathering fight;
1810,ALHALLA.,Clewalla leads—along the wood
1811,ALHALLA.,"Deep shouts resound, and cries of blood,"
1812,ALHALLA.,And soon the distant crack and roar
1813,ALHALLA.,Proclaim another scene of gore.
1814,ALHALLA.,"And rumor rife, along the plain,"
1815,ALHALLA.,Repeats a tale of lost and slain.
1816,ALHALLA.,"From out a wood two hosts advance,"
1817,ALHALLA.,"With glittering sword and pointed lance,"
1818,ALHALLA.,"Rank upon rank—our light clad men,"
1819,ALHALLA.,"Unbooted all, re-sought the glen,"
1820,ALHALLA.,"There, tree to tree, to ward the blow,"
1821,ALHALLA.,And best their forest breeding show;
1822,ALHALLA.,"But while they rally, shout and form,"
1823,ALHALLA.,Behold athwart—another storm!
1824,ALHALLA.,"Fierce, heavy horsemen, sword on high,"
1825,ALHALLA.,Gleam through the woods and fill the sky.
1826,ALHALLA.,"Environed thus, no hope remains"
1827,ALHALLA.,But that a brave man’s hand sustains;
1828,ALHALLA.,"Nor this availed, though plied with skill"
1829,ALHALLA.,"O’er mead and valley, wood and hill,"
1830,ALHALLA.,"And sixty brave hearts, slain that day,"
1831,ALHALLA.,Attest the fury of the fray;
1832,ALHALLA.,"Clewalla, known for daring cry,"
1833,ALHALLA.,"Where bayonets cross and bullets fly,"
1834,ALHALLA.,With rampant arm is seen maintain
1835,ALHALLA.,"The strife, till sinking with the slain;"
1836,ALHALLA.,"But whether wounded, or if low,"
1837,ALHALLA.,"The pulse of life still kept its flow,"
1838,ALHALLA.,Spake rumor not; we searched in vain
1839,ALHALLA.,"Along the wood, amid the slain;"
1840,ALHALLA.,"We traced each secret glen and shore,"
1841,ALHALLA.,But never saw Clewalla more.
1842,ALHALLA.,Murmur there was of varying sound
1843,ALHALLA.,"That he to distant fort was bound,"
1844,ALHALLA.,A captive held; yet ever prone
1845,ALHALLA.,"To swell and shift, and change her tone,"
1846,ALHALLA.,"We found it like an evening’s tale,"
1847,ALHALLA.,And all our search was doomed to fail:
1848,ALHALLA.,"Or if he e’er returned, his tread"
1849,ALHALLA.,Was light as ghost of warrior dead.
1850,ALHALLA.,
1851,ALHALLA.,"Betrayed, encompassed, beaten, prest!"
1852,ALHALLA.,Stem desperation fired each breast;
1853,ALHALLA.,"They burn with wild revenge and ire,"
1854,ALHALLA.,Re-light again the battle fire;
1855,ALHALLA.,"Re-poise the lance—re-plume the dart,"
1856,ALHALLA.,"And rousing each bold warrior art,"
1857,ALHALLA.,"Poured on the reckless battle tide,"
1858,ALHALLA.,Nor asked the boon which they denied.
1859,ALHALLA.,
1860,ALHALLA.,"And long they fought and freely bled,"
1861,ALHALLA.,And heaped their valleys with the dead;
1862,ALHALLA.,"For plain, defile, or wild retreat,"
1863,ALHALLA.,"Still brought disaster and defeat,"
1864,ALHALLA.,"And every hallowed wood and shore,"
1865,ALHALLA.,"Was soiled with war-hoof, axe, or gore."
1866,ALHALLA.,"I mixed again amid the strife,"
1867,ALHALLA.,"Light estimating limb or life,"
1868,ALHALLA.,And for a season strove to guide
1869,ALHALLA.,And stem the furious battle tide.
1870,ALHALLA.,But why repeat the bitter tale?
1871,ALHALLA.,I saw each manly effort fail;
1872,ALHALLA.,"We fought, as if against a spell,"
1873,ALHALLA.,"And, foiled, with Tuscaloosa fell.[6]"
1874,ALHALLA.,"The poor Muscogee race may say,"
1875,ALHALLA.,They yet shall see a happier day;
1876,ALHALLA.,"That happier day I ne’er shall see,"
1877,ALHALLA.,I deem none happy if not free:
1878,ALHALLA.,And with that war—so fates conspire—
1879,ALHALLA.,Went out the brave Muscogee fire.
1880,ALHALLA.,"I, scorning on that soil to be"
1881,ALHALLA.,"No longer honor’d, lov’d, or free!"
1882,ALHALLA.,"Resolved to leave those sunny strands,"
1883,ALHALLA.,"For distant woods and stranger’s lands,"
1884,ALHALLA.,"And bending far, still onward hied,"
1885,ALHALLA.,"By vale and torrent, rock and tide,"
1886,ALHALLA.,"With purpose high, and aim severe,"
1887,ALHALLA.,To close a life of suff’ring here.
1888,ALHALLA.,"Here in my house, which nature made"
1889,ALHALLA.,"Without the white man’s skill or aid,"
1890,ALHALLA.,"A few short years shall close my eyes,"
1891,ALHALLA.,"And leave my bones in northern skies,"
1892,ALHALLA.,And not a trace be left to show
1893,ALHALLA.,Alhalla’s fate—Alhalla’s woe.
1894,ALHALLA.,
1895,ALHALLA.,"[6] The fall of Tuscaloosa, or the Black Warrior, is here symbolically"

1897,ALHALLA.,killed in battle; he came voluntarily to Gen. Jackson’s camp and
1898,ALHALLA.,surrendered himself. He had disguised himself in mean clothes to
1899,ALHALLA.,"prevent his being shot down by the soldiers, as a price had been set"
