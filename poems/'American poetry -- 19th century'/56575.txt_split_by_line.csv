132,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
133,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
134,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"In presenting this volume to the public, I trust that I may be allowed,"
135,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"without incurring the charge of egotism, to say somewhat concerning my"
136,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"spiritual experience, and the manner in which these poems were"
137,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"originated. I am, in a measure, under the necessity of doing this, lest"
138,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"some over-anxious friend, or would-be critic, should undertake the work"
139,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"for me, and thereby place me, either unconsciously or intentionally, in"
140,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,a false position before the public.
141,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
142,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"By the advice of those invisible intelligences, whose presence and power"
143,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"I freely acknowledge, seconded by my own judgment, I have given to this"
144,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"work the title of “Poems from the Inner Life;” for, aside from the"
145,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"external phenomena of Modern Spiritualism,--which, compared to the great"
146,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"principles underlying them, are but mere froth and foam on the ocean of"
147,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"Truth,--I have realized that in the mysterious depths of the Inner Life,"
148,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"all souls can hold communion with those invisible beings, who are our"
149,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,companions both in Time and Eternity. My vision has been dim and
150,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"indistinct, my hearing confused by the jarring discords of earthly"
151,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"existence, and my utterances of a wisdom, higher than my own, impeded by"
152,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"my selfish conceits and vain imaginings. Yet, notwithstanding all this,"
153,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the solemn convictions of my spiritual surroundings, and the mutual ties"
154,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"of interest still existing between souls, “whether in the body or out of"
155,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the body,” have been indelibly impressed upon me. From such experiences"
156,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,I have learned--in a sense hitherto unknown--that “the kingdom of Heaven
157,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,is within me.” I know that many sincere and earnest souls will decide at
158,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"once, in the integrity of their well-trained intellects, that this"
159,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,claim to an intercourse with the invisible world is an extravagant
160,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"assumption, and has no foundation in truth. To such I would say, I shall"
161,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,make no effort to persuade your reason and judgment. I only offer to you
162,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"as a suggestion, that which has been realized by me in my spiritual"
163,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"experience, and has become to me an abiding truth, full of strength for"
164,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the present, and hope for the future. When your souls sincerely hunger"
165,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"after such a revelation, you will seek for it, and according to your"
166,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"need, you will be filled therewith. Until then, you and I, regarding"
167,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"things from a different point of view, must inevitably understand them"
168,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"differently. There are various cups which Humanity must drink of, and"
169,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"“baptisms which it must be baptized with,” and this manifestation of"
170,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"Truth, of which I am but one of the humble representatives, has laid its"
171,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"controlling hand upon me; for what purpose, in the mysterious results"
172,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"which lie concealed in the future, I cannot tell--I only know that it is"
173,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,so.
174,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
175,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"Looking back upon my experience, I cannot doubt that I--with many"
176,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"others--was destined to this phase of development, and designed for this"
177,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"peculiar work, before I knew conscious being. My brain was fashioned,"
178,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"and my nervous system finely strung, so that I should inevitably catch"
179,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the thrill of the innumerable voices resounding through the universe,"
180,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"and translate their messages into human language, as coherently and"
181,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,clearly as my imperfections would allow. The early influences of my
182,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"childhood, the experiences of later years, and more than all, that"
183,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"unutterable yearning for Beauty and Harmony, which I felt dimly"
184,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"conscious was somewhere in the universe, all tended to drive me back"
185,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"from the world, which would not and could not give me what I asked, to"
186,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the revelations of my inner life,--to the “Heaven within me.” It was"
187,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,only through the cultivation of my spiritual nature that “spiritual
188,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"things were to be discerned,” and the stern necessity of my life was the"
189,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,Teacher which finally educated me into the perception of Truth.
190,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
191,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,I turn back to the memories of my childhood--to that long course of
192,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"trying experiences through which I passed, guided by strange and"
193,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,invisible influences; and that whole course of discipline has for me now
194,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"a peculiar significance. Those who were near and dear to me, and who"
195,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"were most familiar with my habits of life, knew little of my intense"
196,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,spiritual experience. I was too much afraid of being ridiculed and
197,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,misunderstood to dare give any expression to the strange and indefinable
198,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"emotions within me. Such ones, however, may call to mind the child who"
199,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"often, through the long winter evenings, sat in profound silence by the"
200,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"fireside, with her head and face enveloped in her apron, to exclude, as"
201,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"far as possible, all external sight and sound. What I heard and saw then"
202,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,but dimly returns to me; but even then the revelations from the “Heaven
203,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"within” had commenced, and succeeding years have so strengthened and"
204,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"confirmed my vision, that such scenes have become to me living truths"
205,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,and blessed realities. The “Heaven” that “lay about me in my infancy”
206,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"sent its rich glow through my childhood, and sheds its mystic brightness"
207,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,upon the pathway of my riper years.
208,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
209,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"Often, in the retirement of a small closet, I spent hours in total"
210,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"darkness, lying prostrate on the floor, beating the waves of the"
211,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"mysterious Infinite that rolled in a stormy flood over me, and with"
212,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,prayers and tears beseeching deliverance from my blindness and seeming
213,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"unbelief. Then, when by my earnestness the spirit had become stronger"
214,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"than the flesh, I would gradually fall into a deep trance, from which I"
215,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,would arise strengthened and consoled by the assurance--from whence I
216,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"could not tell--that somewhere in the future I should find all the life,"
217,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"and light, and freedom that my soul desired. The only evidence or"
218,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,knowledge which those around me received of such visitations was
219,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"occasionally a poem--some of them written so early in life, that the"
220,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,childish chirography rendered them almost illegible. Because of these
221,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"early productions, it has been asserted that my claim to any individual"
222,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,spirit-influence was either a falsehood or delusion. I will only say in
223,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"reply, that there is no need of entering upon any argument on the"
224,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"subject. I claim both a general and particular inspiration. They do not,"
225,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"by any means, conflict; and what I do not receive from one, comes from"
226,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the other. For the very reason that I have natural poetic tendencies, I"
227,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"attract influences of a kindred nature; and when I desire it, or they"
228,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"will to do so, they cast their characteristic inspirations upon me, and"
229,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,I give them utterance according to my ability. It is often as difficult
230,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,to decide what is the action of one’s own intellect and what is
231,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"spirit-influence, as it is in our ordinary associations to determine"
232,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,what is original with ourselves and what we have received from
233,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"circumstances or contact with the mind of others. Yet, nevertheless,"
234,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,there are cases where the distinction is so evident that it is not to be
235,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,doubted. Only one or two such well-attested instances is sufficient to
236,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,establish the theory. I am not willing to ignore one faculty or power of
237,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"my being for the sake of proving a favorite idea; and, on the contrary,"
238,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"I cannot conscientiously deny that, in the mysteries of my inner life, I"
239,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,have been acted upon decidedly and directly by disembodied
240,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"intelligences, and this, sometimes, by an inspiration characteristic of"
241,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the individual, or by a psychological influence similar to that whereby"
242,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,mind acts upon mind in the body. Under such influences I have not
243,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"necessarily lost my individuality, or become wholly unconscious. I was,"
244,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"for the time being, like a harp in the hands of superior powers, and"
245,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,just in proportion as my entire nature was attuned to thrill responsive
246,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"to their touch, did I give voice and expression to their unwritten"
247,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"music. They furnished the inspiration, but it was of necessity modified"
248,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"by the nature and character of the instrument upon which they played,"
249,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,for the most skilful musician cannot change the tone of a harp to the
250,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"sound of a trumpet, though he may give a characteristic expression of"
251,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,himself through either.
252,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
253,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,The presence and influence of these powers is to me no new or recent
254,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"occurrence, although I may not have understood them in the same light as"
255,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"I do at present. They have formed a part of all my past life, and I can"
256,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,trace the evidence of spiritual assistance running like a golden thread
257,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,through all my intellectual efforts. As I do not desire to practise any
258,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"deception upon the public, but on the contrary only wish to declare the"
259,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"simple truth, I have published in this volume quite a number of poems,"
260,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,written several years previous to my appearance before the public as a
261,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,medium or a speaker. Although these were mostly wrought out of my brain
262,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"by the slow process of thought, yet for some of these, even, I can claim"
263,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,as direct and special an inspiration as for those delivered upon the
264,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"platform. The first poem in this present work,--“The Prayer of the"
265,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"Sorrowing,”--and that which immediately succeeds it,--“The Song of"
266,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"Truth,”--containing in itself an answer to the Prayer, were given to me"
267,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"under peculiar circumstances. The first was the language of my own soul,"
268,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"intensified by an occasion of great mental anguish. The second,"
269,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"following directly upon it, was an illumination of my entire being, when"
270,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"I seemed to have wept away the scales from my eyes, and “by the deep"
271,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"conflict of my soul in prayer,” to have broken the fetters of my"
272,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"mortality, and stepped forth into that freedom whereby I stood face to"
273,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"face with the ministering spirits, and heard that “Song of Truth”"
274,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,sounding through the universe. I have only known but few such
275,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"visitations in my lifetime, but when they have come, I have felt that I"
276,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"have taken a free, deep breath of celestial air, and caught a glimpse of"
277,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the Realities of Things. As an immediate consequence, my spirit has"
278,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"become braver and stronger, and long after my inward vision was closed,"
279,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,the cheering light of that blessed revelation has lingered in my heart.
280,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
281,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"Another poem, which bore evidence to me of an inspiration acting upon"
282,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"me, and external to myself, was the “Song of the North,” relating to the"
283,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,fate of Sir John Franklin and his men. I was desired to write an
284,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"illustration for a plate, about to appear in the “Lily of the Valley,”"
285,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"an Annual published by J. M. Usher, of Cornhill, Boston. I endeavored to"
286,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"do so, but day after day passed by and my labor was in vain, for not one"
287,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,acceptable idea would suggest itself. The publisher sent for the
288,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"article, but it was not in being. One day, however, I was seized with an"
289,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,indefinable uneasiness. I wandered up and down through the house and
290,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"garden, till finally the idea of what I was to do became clearly"
291,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"defined; then, with my paper and pencil, I hastened to a quiet corner in"
292,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the attic, where nearly all my poems had been written, and there I wrote"
293,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the Song of the North--so rapidly, that it was scarce legible, and I"
294,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"was obliged to copy it at once, lest I should lose the connection. The"
295,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,next day it seemed as foreign and strange to me as it would to any one
296,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"who had never seen it. At the time this was written (in April, 1853)"
297,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"strong hopes were entertained of the discovery of Franklin and his men,"
298,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,together with their safe return; therefore I hesitated to make public
299,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"that which seemed a decided affirmation to the contrary. Nevertheless,"
300,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"so strong were my convictions as to the truth of the poem, that I"
301,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,allowed it to be published. Later revelations concerning the fate of
302,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,that brave adventurer and his companions gave to the poem somewhat of
303,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,the character of a prophecy.
304,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
305,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"How far I have ever written, independent of these higher influences, I"
306,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,cannot say; I only know that all the poems under my own name have come
307,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,from the deep places of my “Inner Life;” and in that self-same sacred
308,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,retreat--which I have entered either by the intense concentration of all
309,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"my intellectual powers, or a passive surrender to the inspirations that"
310,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,moved upon me--I have held conscious communion with disembodied spirits.
311,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,At such times it has been said I was “entranced;” and although that term
312,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"does not exactly express my idea, perhaps it is the best which can yet"
313,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"be found in our language. The avenues of external sense, if not entirely"
314,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"closed, were at least disused, in order that the spiritual perceptions"
315,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"might be quickened to the required degree, and also that the world of"
316,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"causes, of which earth and its experiences are but the passing effects,"
317,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,might be disclosed to my vision. Certain it is that a physical change
318,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"took place, affecting both my breathing and circulation, and my"
319,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,clairvoyant powers were so strengthened that I could dimly perceive
320,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"external objects from the frontal portion of my brain, even with my eyes"
321,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"closed and bandaged; also, in that state, any excess of light was far"
322,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,more painful than under ordinary conditions. If the communications given
323,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"through my instrumentality have been weak, erroneous, and imperfect, it"
324,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"is no fault of my spirit-teachers, but arises rather from my own"
325,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,inability to understand or clearly express what was communicated to me.
326,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
327,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,In relation to the poems given under direct spirit-influence I would
328,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"say, that there has been a mistake existing in many minds concerning"
329,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"them, which I take the present opportunity, as far as possible, to"
330,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"correct. They were not like lightning flashes, coming unheralded, and"
331,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,vanishing without leaving a trace behind. Several days before they were
332,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"given, I would receive intimations of them. Oftentimes, and particularly"
333,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"under the influence of Poe, I would awake in the night from a deep"
334,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"slumber, and detached fragments of those poems would be floating through"
335,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"my mind, though in a few moments after they would vanish like a dream. I"
336,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,have sometimes awakened myself by repeating them aloud. I have been
337,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"informed, also, by these influences, that all their poems are as"
338,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"complete and finished in spirit-life as they are in this, and the only"
339,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,reason why they cannot be repeated again and again is because of the
340,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,difficulty of bringing a human organism always into the same state of
341,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"exaltation--a state in which mediums readily receive inspiration, and"
342,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,render the poems with the least interference of their own intellect.
343,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
344,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,Among these spiritual poems will be found two purporting to come from
345,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,Shakspeare. This influence seemed to overwhelm and crush me. I was
346,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"afraid, and shrank from it. Only those two poems were given, and then"
347,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,the attempt was not repeated. I do not think that the poems in
348,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,themselves come up to the productions of his master mind. They are only
349,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"intimations of what might have been, if he had had a stronger and more"
350,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,effectual instrument upon which to pour his inspirations. I have no
351,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,doubt that time will yet furnish one upon whom his mantle will fall; but
352,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,I can only say that his power was mightier than I could bear. As I have
353,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"regarded him spiritually, he seems to be a majestic intellect, but one"
354,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"that overawes rather than attracts me; and my conclusion has been, that"
355,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"while in the flesh, although he was of himself a mighty mind, yet still"
356,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"he spake wiser than he knew, being moved upon by those superior powers"
357,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"who choose men for their mouthpieces, and oblige them to speak startling"
358,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,words into the dull ear of the times. As all Nature is a manifestation
359,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"of Deity, so all Humanity is a manifestation of mind,--differing,"
360,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"however, in degrees of development,--and one body serves as an"
361,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,instrument to effect the purposes of many minds. This is illustrated in
362,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the pursuits and employments of ordinary life, and has a far deeper"
363,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,significance when taken in connection with the invisible world.
364,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
365,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"The influence of Burns was pleasant, easy, and exhilarating, and left me"
366,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"in a cheerful mood. As a spirit, he seemed to be genial and kindly, with"
367,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"a clear perception and earnest love of simple truth, and at the same"
368,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"time a good-natured contempt for all shams, mere forms, and solemn"
369,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"mockeries. This was the way in which he impressed me, and I felt much"
370,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,more benefited than burdened by his presence.
371,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
372,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"The first poem delivered by Poe, came to me far more unexpectedly than"
373,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"any other. By referring to the introductory remarks, copied from the"
374,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"“Springfield Republican,” it will be seen that the supposition is"
375,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"presented, that I, or “the one who wrote the poem,” must have been very"
376,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"familiar with the writings of Poe. As no one wrote the poem for me,"
377,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,consequently I am the only one who can answer to the supposition; and I
378,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"can say, most conscientiously, that previous to that time I had never"
379,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"read, to my knowledge, any of his poems, save “The Raven,” and I had not"
380,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"seen that for several years. Indeed, I may well say in this connection,"
381,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"that I have read, comparatively speaking, very little poetry in the"
382,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"course of my life, and have never made the style of any author a study."
383,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,The influence of Poe was neither pleasant nor easy. I can only describe
384,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,it as a species of mental intoxication. I was tortured with a feeling
385,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"of great restlessness and irritability, and strange, incongruous images"
386,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"crowded my brain. Some were bewildering and dazzling as the sun, others"
387,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"dark and repulsive. Under his influence, particularly, I suffered the"
388,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"greatest exhaustion of vital energy, so much so, that after giving one"
389,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"of his poems, I was usually quite ill for several days."
390,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
391,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"But from his first poem to the last,--“The Farewell to Earth,”--was a"
392,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"marked, and rapid change. It would seem as though, in that higher life,"
393,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,where the opportunities for spiritual development far transcend those of
394,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"earth, that by his quick and active perceptions he had seized upon the"
395,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"Divine Idea which was endeavoring to find expression through his life,"
396,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,both in Time and Eternity; and that from the moment this became
397,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"apparent, with a volcanic energy, with the battle-strokes of a true"
398,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"hero, he had overthrown every obstacle, and hewn a way through every"
399,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,barrier that impeded the free outgrowth and manifestation of his diviner
400,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,self. His “Farewell” is not a mere poem of the imagination. It is a
401,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"record of facts. I can clearly perceive, as his spirit has been revealed"
402,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"to me, that there was a deep significance in his words, when he said,--"
403,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
404,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"“I will sunder, and forever,"
405,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,Every tie of _human passion_ that can bind my soul to Earth--
406,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,Every _slavish_ tie that binds me to the things of little worth.”
407,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
408,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"As he last appeared to me, he was full of majesty and strength,"
409,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"self-poised and calm, and it would seem by the expression of his"
410,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"countenance, radiant with victory, that the reward promised to “him that"
411,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"overcometh,” had been made his sure possession. Around his brow, as a"
412,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"spiritual emblem, was an olive-wreath, whose leaves glowed like fire. He"
413,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"stood upon the side of a mountain, which was white and glittering like"
414,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"crystal, and the full tide of inspiration to which he gave utterance"
415,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"could not be comprehended in human speech. That last “Farewell,” as it"
416,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"found expression through my weak lips, was but the faintest possible"
417,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,echo of that most musical and majestic lyric which thrilled the
418,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"harp-strings of my being. In order to be fully realized and understood,"
419,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"the soul must be transported to that sphere of spiritual _perceptions_,"
420,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"where there is no _audible_ “speech nor language,” and where the “voice"
421,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,is not _heard_.”
422,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
423,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"Obedient to the call of the Angels, he has “gone up higher” in the ways"
424,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"of Eternal Progress; and though, because of this change, he may no"
425,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"longer manifest himself as he _was_, yet doubtless as he _is_, he will"
426,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,yet be felt as a Presence and a Power in the “Heaven” of many a human
427,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"heart. Upon earth he was a meteor light, flashing with a startling"
428,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,brilliancy across the intellectual firmament; but now he is a star of
429,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"ever-increasing magnitude, which has at length gravitated to its own"
430,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,place among the celestial spheres.
431,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
432,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"In saying thus much, I cannot so play the coward to my spiritual"
433,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,convictions as to offer the slightest apology for any ideas I may have
434,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"advanced contrary to popular prejudices or time-honored opinions. O,"
435,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"thoughtful reader! if I have offended thee, say simply that these are"
436,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"_my_ convictions and not _yours_, and do not fear for the result; for in"
437,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"whatsoever I purpose or perform, I “can do nothing against the"
438,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,Truth--only for it.” I do not indulge in the conceit that this little
439,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"work has any important mission to perform, or that it will cause any"
440,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"commotion in the literary world. But I have felt, as one by one these"
441,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,poems have been wrought out--by general or special inspiration--from my
442,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"“Inner Life,” that in this matter I had a work, simple though it might"
443,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"be, to do, and my soul was sorely “straitened till it was"
444,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,accomplished.”
445,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
446,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"As some of these poems, appearing at various times, have been severely"
447,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"criticized in the past, so I would say now, that if any there should be,"
448,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"who, through bigotry, or prejudice, or a desire to display their"
449,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"superior wisdom, should choose to criticize them in their present"
450,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,form--to such I shall make no answer. But to all those earnest and
451,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"inquiring souls, who feel that in such experiences as I have described,"
452,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"or in the resources from which my soul has drawn its supply, there is"
453,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"aught that is attractive or desirable to them, I would say, “God speed"
454,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"you in your search for Truth!” At the same time let me assure you, that"
455,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,in the depths of your own Inner Life there is a fountain of inspiration
456,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"and wisdom, which, if sought aright, will yield you more abundant"
457,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"satisfaction than any simple cup of the living water which I, or any"
458,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"other individual, can place to your lips. There are invisible teachers"
459,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"around you, the hem of whose garments I am unworthy to touch. “The"
460,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,words that they speak unto you--they are Spirit and they are Life.” “In
461,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,order to _know_ more you must _be_ more.” Faith strikes its roots deep
462,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"in the spirit, and often Intuition is a safer guide than Reason. When a"
463,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"man, by constant practice, has so quickened his spiritual perceptions"
464,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"that he can receive conscious impressions from his invisible attendants,"
465,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,he will never be without counsellors.
466,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,
467,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,“Let Faith be given

471,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"The Spirit-World is not so distant as it seems, and the veil of"
472,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"Materiality which hides it from our view, by hopeful and untiring"

474,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"attentively, and we shall soon learn to keep step in the grand march of"
475,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,Life to the music of the upper spheres. As a popular author has
476,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"beautifully said, “Silence is vocal, if we listen well.” With a sublime"
477,A WORD TO THE WORLD.,"accord, the great anthem of the Infinite “rolls and resounds” through"

2009,I STILL LIVE.,
2010,I STILL LIVE.,"[Given under the inspiration of Miss A. W. Sprague, at the conclusion of"
2011,I STILL LIVE.,"a lecture in Philadelphia, October 25, 1863.]"
2012,I STILL LIVE.,
2013,I STILL LIVE.,
2014,I STILL LIVE.,"O Thou, whose love is changeless,"
2015,I STILL LIVE.,Both now and evermore;
2016,I STILL LIVE.,Source of all conscious being!
2017,I STILL LIVE.,Thy goodness I adore.
2018,I STILL LIVE.,"Lord, I would ever praise Thee,"
2019,I STILL LIVE.,For all Thy love can give;
2020,I STILL LIVE.,"But most of all, O Father!"
2021,I STILL LIVE.,I thank Thee that I live.
2022,I STILL LIVE.,
2023,I STILL LIVE.,I live! O ye who loved me!
2024,I STILL LIVE.,Your faith was not in vain;
2025,I STILL LIVE.,Back through the shadowy valley
2026,I STILL LIVE.,I come to you again.
2027,I STILL LIVE.,"Safe in the love that guides me,"
2028,I STILL LIVE.,With fearless feet I tread--
2029,I STILL LIVE.,My home is with the angels--
2030,I STILL LIVE.,"O, say not I am dead!"
2031,I STILL LIVE.,
2032,I STILL LIVE.,"Not dead! O, no, but lifted"
2033,I STILL LIVE.,Above all earthly strife;
2034,I STILL LIVE.,"Now first I know the meaning,"
2035,I STILL LIVE.,And feel the power of life--
2036,I STILL LIVE.,The power to rise uncumbered
2037,I STILL LIVE.,"By woe, or want, or care;"
2038,I STILL LIVE.,To breathe fresh inspiration
2039,I STILL LIVE.,"From pure, celestial air;--"
2040,I STILL LIVE.,
2041,I STILL LIVE.,To feel that all the tempests
2042,I STILL LIVE.,"Of human life have passed,"
2043,I STILL LIVE.,"And that my ark, in safety"
2044,I STILL LIVE.,Rests on the mount at last;
2045,I STILL LIVE.,"To send my soul’s great longings,"
2046,I STILL LIVE.,"Like Noah’s dove, abroad,"
2047,I STILL LIVE.,"And find them swift returning,"
2048,I STILL LIVE.,With signs of peace from God;--
2049,I STILL LIVE.,
2050,I STILL LIVE.,To soar in fearless freedom
2051,I STILL LIVE.,"Through broad, blue, boundless skies"
2052,I STILL LIVE.,And catch the radiant gleaming
2053,I STILL LIVE.,"Of love-lit, angel eyes;"
2054,I STILL LIVE.,To feel the Father’s presence
2055,I STILL LIVE.,"Around me, near or far,"
2056,I STILL LIVE.,And see His radiant glory
2057,I STILL LIVE.,"Stretch onward, star by star;--"
2058,I STILL LIVE.,
2059,I STILL LIVE.,To feel those grand upliftings
2060,I STILL LIVE.,That know not space nor time;
2061,I STILL LIVE.,To hear all discords ending
2062,I STILL LIVE.,In harmony sublime;
2063,I STILL LIVE.,To know that sin and error
2064,I STILL LIVE.,"Are dimly understood,"
2065,I STILL LIVE.,And that which man calls Evil
2066,I STILL LIVE.,Is undeveloped Good;--
2067,I STILL LIVE.,
2068,I STILL LIVE.,To stand in spell-bound rapture
2069,I STILL LIVE.,"On some celestial height,"
2070,I STILL LIVE.,And see God’s glorious sunshine
2071,I STILL LIVE.,Dispel the shades of night;
2072,I STILL LIVE.,To feel that all creation
2073,I STILL LIVE.,With love and joy is rife;--
2074,I STILL LIVE.,"This, O my earthly loved ones,"
2075,I STILL LIVE.,This is Eternal Life!
2076,I STILL LIVE.,
2077,I STILL LIVE.,"There, eyes that closed in darkness"
2078,I STILL LIVE.,Shall open to the morn;
2079,I STILL LIVE.,"And those whom death had stricken,"
2080,I STILL LIVE.,Shall find themselves new-born;
2081,I STILL LIVE.,"The lame shall leap with gladness,"
2082,I STILL LIVE.,The blind rejoice to see;
2083,I STILL LIVE.,"The slave shall know no master,"
2084,I STILL LIVE.,And the prisoner shall be free.
2085,I STILL LIVE.,
2086,I STILL LIVE.,"There, the worn and heavy-laden"
2087,I STILL LIVE.,Their burdens shall lay down;
2088,I STILL LIVE.,"There, crosses, borne in meekness,"
2089,I STILL LIVE.,At length shall win the crown;
2090,I STILL LIVE.,And lonely hearts that famished
2091,I STILL LIVE.,"For sympathy and love,"
2092,I STILL LIVE.,Shall find a free affection
2093,I STILL LIVE.,In the angel-home above.
2094,I STILL LIVE.,
2095,I STILL LIVE.,"O, children of our Father!"
2096,I STILL LIVE.,"Weep not for those who pass,"
2097,I STILL LIVE.,"Like rose-leaves gently scattered,"
2098,I STILL LIVE.,Like dew-drops from the grass.
2099,I STILL LIVE.,"Ay, look not down in sadness,"
2100,I STILL LIVE.,But fix your gaze on high;
2101,I STILL LIVE.,They only dropped their mantles--
2102,I STILL LIVE.,Their souls can never die.
2103,I STILL LIVE.,
2104,I STILL LIVE.,They live! and still unbroken
2105,I STILL LIVE.,"Is that magnetic chain,"
2106,I STILL LIVE.,"Which, in your tearful blindness,"
2107,I STILL LIVE.,You thought was rent in twain.
2108,I STILL LIVE.,That chain of love was fashioned
2109,I STILL LIVE.,"By more than human art,"
2110,I STILL LIVE.,And every link is welded
2111,I STILL LIVE.,So firm it cannot part.
2112,I STILL LIVE.,
2113,I STILL LIVE.,"They live! but O, not idly,"
2114,I STILL LIVE.,"To fold their hands to rest,"
2115,I STILL LIVE.,"For they who love God truly,"
2116,I STILL LIVE.,Are they who serve him best.
2117,I STILL LIVE.,"Love lightens all their labor,"
2118,I STILL LIVE.,And makes all duty sweet;
2119,I STILL LIVE.,"Their hands are never weary,"
2120,I STILL LIVE.,Nor way-worn are their feet.
2121,I STILL LIVE.,
2122,I STILL LIVE.,"Thus by that world of beauty,"
2123,I STILL LIVE.,"And by that life of love,"
2124,I STILL LIVE.,And by the holy angels
2125,I STILL LIVE.,"Who listen now above,"
2126,I STILL LIVE.,"I pledge my soul’s endeavor,"
2127,I STILL LIVE.,To do whate’er I can
2128,I STILL LIVE.,"To bless my sister woman,"
2129,I STILL LIVE.,And aid my brother man.
2130,I STILL LIVE.,
2131,I STILL LIVE.,"O Thou, whose love is changeless,"
2132,I STILL LIVE.,"Both now and evermore,"
2133,I STILL LIVE.,Source of all conscious being!
2134,I STILL LIVE.,Thy goodness I adore.
2135,I STILL LIVE.,"Lord, I would ever praise Thee"
2136,I STILL LIVE.,For all Thy love can give;
2137,I STILL LIVE.,"But most of all, O Father,"
2138,I STILL LIVE.,I thank Thee that I live.
2139,I STILL LIVE.,
2140,I STILL LIVE.,
2141,I STILL LIVE.,
2142,I STILL LIVE.,
2143,I STILL LIVE.,[The two following poems were given under an influence purporting to be
2144,I STILL LIVE.,that of Shakspeare.]
2145,I STILL LIVE.,
2146,LIFE.,LIFE.
2147,LIFE.,
2148,LIFE.,
2149,LIFE.,"“To be, or not to be,” is not “the question;”"
2150,LIFE.,"There is no choice of Life. Ay, mark it well!--"
2151,LIFE.,For Death is but another name for Change.
2152,LIFE.,"The weary shuffle off their mortal coil,"
2153,LIFE.,And think to slumber in eternal night.
2154,LIFE.,"But, lo! the man, though dead, is living still;"
2155,LIFE.,"Unclothed, is clothed upon, and his Mortality"
2156,LIFE.,Is swallowed up of Life.
2157,LIFE.,
2158,LIFE.,"“He babbles o’ green fields, then falls asleep,”"
2159,LIFE.,And straight awakes amid eternal verdure.
2160,LIFE.,"Fairer than “dreams of a Midsummer’s Night,”"
2161,LIFE.,The fields Elysian stretch before him.
2162,LIFE.,No “Tempest” rends the ever peaceful bowers
2163,LIFE.,"Of asphodel, and fadeless amaranth;"
2164,LIFE.,No hot sirocco blows with poisonous breath;
2165,LIFE.,"No midnight frights him with its goblins grim,"
2166,LIFE.,"Presaging sudden death. No Macbeth there,"
2167,LIFE.,"Mad with ambition, plotteth damning deeds;"
2168,LIFE.,"No Hamlet, haunted by his father’s ghost,"
2169,LIFE.,Stalks wildly forth intent on vengeance dire.
2170,LIFE.,"The curse of Cain on earth is consummate,"
2171,LIFE.,And knows no resurrection. Spirits learn
2172,LIFE.,"That spirit is immortal, and no poisoned cup,"
2173,LIFE.,"Or dagger’s thrust, or sting of deadly asp,"
2174,LIFE.,Can rob it of its Godlike attribute.
2175,LIFE.,This mortal garb may be as full of wounds
2176,LIFE.,And bloody rents as royal Cæsar’s mantle;
2177,LIFE.,Yet that which made it man or Cæsar liveth still.
2178,LIFE.,
2179,LIFE.,"Man learns, in this Valhalla of his soul,"
2180,LIFE.,"To love, nor ever finds “Love’s Labor Lost.”"
2181,LIFE.,No two-faced Falstaff proffers double suit;
2182,LIFE.,No Desdemona mourns Iago’s art;
2183,LIFE.,And every Romeo finds his Juliet.
2184,LIFE.,"The stroke of Death is but a kindly frost,"
2185,LIFE.,"Which cracks the shell, and leaves the kernel room"
2186,LIFE.,To germinate. What most consummate fools
2187,LIFE.,This fear of death doth make us! Reason plays
2188,LIFE.,"The craven unto sense, and in her fear"
2189,LIFE.,"Chooses the slow and slavish death of life,"
2190,LIFE.,Rather than freedom in the life of death.
2191,LIFE.,"“Thus _Ignorance_ makes cowards of us all,”"
2192,LIFE.,And blinds us to our being’s best estate.
2193,LIFE.,"Madly we cling to life through nameless ills,"
2194,LIFE.,"Pinched by necessity, and scourged by fate,"
2195,LIFE.,"Fainting in heat and freezing in the cold,"
2196,LIFE.,"While war, and pestilence, and sore distress,"
2197,LIFE.,"Fever and famine, fire and flood, combine"
2198,LIFE.,To drive the spirit from its wreck of clay.
2199,LIFE.,
2200,LIFE.,"O, poor Humanity! How full of blots,"
2201,LIFE.,"And stains, and pains, and miseries thou art!"
2202,LIFE.,"Here let me be thine Antony, and plead"
2203,LIFE.,Thy cause against the slayers of thy peace.
2204,LIFE.,"Though wounded, yet thou art not dead, thou child"
2205,LIFE.,Of Immortality--thou heir of God!
2206,LIFE.,"He who would slay thee, be he brute or Brutus,"
2207,LIFE.,Plunges the dagger in his own vile heart.
2208,LIFE.,And yet thy wounds are piteous. I could weep
2209,LIFE.,That aught so fair from the Creator’s hand
2210,LIFE.,"Should be so marred and mangled, like a lamb"
2211,LIFE.,"Torn by the ravening wolves. Here, let me take"
2212,LIFE.,"Thy mantle, pierced with gaping, ghastly wounds,"
2213,LIFE.,From daggers clutched by ingrate hands. O Truth!
2214,LIFE.,"How many, in thy sacred name, have slain"
2215,LIFE.,"Humanity, thinking they did God service!"
2216,LIFE.,"Rome, and not Cæsar--Doctrines, and not Men."
2217,LIFE.,
2218,LIFE.,"I cannot count the wounds which lust for power,"
2219,LIFE.,"And wealth, and place, and precedence have made."
2220,LIFE.,"But, O! the keenest, deepest, deadliest stabs"
2221,LIFE.,"Of all, were made by false Philosophy"
2222,LIFE.,And false Theology combined--
2223,LIFE.,"Philosophy, that knew not what it did;"
2224,LIFE.,"Theology, that did not what it knew."
2225,LIFE.,"See here! This rent made by the fear of God,"
2226,LIFE.,"That gracious God, whose “mercy seasons justice,”"
2227,LIFE.,"Who feeds the raven, clothes the lilies, heeds"
2228,LIFE.,"The sparrow when it falls, and sends his rain"
2229,LIFE.,Alike upon the evil and the good.
2230,LIFE.,And yet they were all “honorable men”
2231,LIFE.,Who taught this doctrine--“_honorable men!_”
2232,LIFE.,Whose failing was a lack of common sense.
2233,LIFE.,
2234,LIFE.,"And, lo! here is another--Fear of Truth--"
2235,LIFE.,"Blind Superstition made this horrid rent,"
2236,LIFE.,And Bigotry quick followed up the thrust.
2237,LIFE.,"O, ’tis an eye weeping great tears of blood!"
2238,LIFE.,"An eagle eye, that dared to love the light"
2239,LIFE.,"Which Bigotry and Superstition feared,"
2240,LIFE.,Lest it should make their deeds of evil plain.
2241,LIFE.,"Thus is it, he who dares to see a Truth"
2242,LIFE.,"Not recognized in creeds, must die the death."
2243,LIFE.,"But noon-day never stayed for bats and owls,"
2244,LIFE.,And Truth’s clear light shall yet arise and shine.
2245,LIFE.,
2246,LIFE.,See here: another wound--The fear of Death--
2247,LIFE.,"That blesséd consummation of this life,"
2248,LIFE.,"Which soothes all pain, makes good all loss, revives"
2249,LIFE.,"The weak, gives rest and peace, makes free the slave,"
2250,LIFE.,"Levels all past distinctions, and doth place"
2251,LIFE.,The beggar on a footing with the king.
2252,LIFE.,"O, poor Humanity! those who conspired"
2253,LIFE.,"To slay thee, through exceeding love for God,"
2254,LIFE.,"And for the glory of His mighty name,"
2255,LIFE.,"Smote at the very centre of thy peace,"
2256,LIFE.,"And damning doubts, like daggers’ thrusts, attest"
2257,LIFE.,How zealously they aimed each cruel blow.
2258,LIFE.,
2259,LIFE.,"And yet, this rent and bloody mantle is not thee."
2260,LIFE.,"Slain, but not dead--thy spirit shall arise"
2261,LIFE.,"And face thy startled enemies again,"
2262,LIFE.,"As royal Cæsar’s ghost appeared to Brutus,"
2263,LIFE.,In Sardis’ and Philippi’s tented plains.
2264,LIFE.,Thou royal heir to kingdoms yet unknown!
2265,LIFE.,A mightier than Cæsar is thy Friend.
2266,LIFE.,"He stays the hand of Cassius, Brutus, all"
2267,LIFE.,"Who aim their weapons at thy life, and dulls"
2268,LIFE.,Their daggers’ points against thy deathless soul.
2269,LIFE.,"From every gaping wound of fear or doubt,"
2270,LIFE.,"Murder or malice, sorrow or despair,"
2271,LIFE.,Thy spirit leaps as from a prison door.
2272,LIFE.,"It laughs at death and daggers, as it flies"
2273,LIFE.,To hold companionship with spirits blest;
2274,LIFE.,"And having thus informed itself of life,"
2275,LIFE.,"The question then,--“To be, or not to be?”--"
2276,LIFE.,Is swallowed up in Immortality.
2277,LIFE.,
2278,LIFE.,
2279,LIFE.,
2280,LIFE.,
2281,LOVE.,LOVE.
2282,LOVE.,
2283,LOVE.,[Shakspeare.]
2284,LOVE.,
2285,LOVE.,
2286,LOVE.,O World! somewhat I have to say to thee.
2287,LOVE.,"O sin-sick, heart-sick, soul-sick, love-sick World!"
2288,LOVE.,"So ailing art thou, both in part and particle,"
2289,LOVE.,That solid truth thy stomach ill digests.
2290,LOVE.,"Yet, since thou art my mother, I will love thee,"
2291,LOVE.,"And heedless of thy frowns, “will speak right on.”"
2292,LOVE.,
2293,LOVE.,That which belongs to all men is least prized;
2294,LOVE.,The thing most common is least understood.
2295,LOVE.,That which is deep and silent is divine;
2296,LOVE.,"And there is nought on earth so craved, so common,"
2297,LOVE.,"So misunderstood, or so divine, as Love."
2298,LOVE.,"When meted in proportion to man’s need,"
2299,LOVE.,"“Measure for measure” it doth purify,"
2300,LOVE.,"Exalt, and make him equal with the gods."
2301,LOVE.,"He feeds upon ambrosia, and his drink"
2302,LOVE.,Is nectar; high Olympus cannot yield
2303,LOVE.,Delights more grateful to his soul and sense.
2304,LOVE.,"Parnassus fails his rapture to express,"
2305,LOVE.,And Helicon hath less of inspiration.
2306,LOVE.,"But, prithee, should he chance to drink too deep"
2307,LOVE.,"Of the exhilarating draught,--should plunge"
2308,LOVE.,"Him head and ears into this ’wildering flood,--"
2309,LOVE.,"Mark, then, what marvellous diversions"
2310,LOVE.,From the centre of his gravity ensue.
2311,LOVE.,Judgment is scouted--sober common sense
2312,LOVE.,Yields to imagination’s airy flights;
2313,LOVE.,"Upon a swift-winged hippogriff he mounts,"
2314,LOVE.,To seek the fair Arcadia of his dreams.
2315,LOVE.,He builds him castles--basks in moonshine--feeds
2316,LOVE.,Among the lilies--pours his passion forth
2317,LOVE.,In amorous canticles and burning sighs--
2318,LOVE.,"Makes him a bed of roses, and lies down"
2319,LOVE.,To revel in his rainbow-colored dreams--
2320,LOVE.,"Until some turn, some ill-begotten chance,"
2321,LOVE.,"Most unexpectedly invades his peace,"
2322,LOVE.,"And castles, moonshine, roses, rainbows fly,"
2323,LOVE.,And leave him to the stern realities of life.
2324,LOVE.,"Alas, poor Human Nature! Even fools"
2325,LOVE.,Must learn through sad experience to grow wise.
2326,LOVE.,
2327,LOVE.,Love is the highest attribute of Deity;
2328,LOVE.,And he who loves divinely is most blest.
2329,LOVE.,"It purgeth passion from the soul and sense,"
2330,LOVE.,And makes the man a unit in himself;
2331,LOVE.,"Head, eyes, hands, heart, all work in unison,"
2332,LOVE.,"And beasts, and savages, and rudest hinds,"
2333,LOVE.,All feel alike its exercise of power.
2334,LOVE.,
2335,LOVE.,Ambition cannot walk with it; for he
2336,LOVE.,"Who learns to live and love aright, loves all,"
2337,LOVE.,And finds preferment in the general weal.
2338,LOVE.,"Though, Proteus like, it takes a thousand forms,"
2339,LOVE.,"It doth o’ercome all evil with its good,"
2340,LOVE.,"Casteth out devils--sensuality, and sin,"
2341,LOVE.,"And green-eyed jealousy, and hate; and like"
2342,LOVE.,"Chrysostom, golden-mouthed, it doth attune"
2343,LOVE.,"The words of common speech to sweet accord,"
2344,LOVE.,And gives significance to simplest things.
2345,LOVE.,
2346,LOVE.,"It buddeth out in tender infancy,"
2347,LOVE.,"Like fresh-blown violets in the early spring,"
2348,LOVE.,And giveth form and fashion to all life.
2349,LOVE.,"For, by its character, it doth decide"
2350,LOVE.,What elements and essences the soul
2351,LOVE.,Shall draw from contact with material things.
2352,LOVE.,"As roses draw their blushes, lilies whiteness,"
2353,LOVE.,"Violets their azure, from the same dull earth,"
2354,LOVE.,"So Love extracts the sweetnesses of Life,"
2355,LOVE.,"And doth so mingle all within her crucible,"
2356,LOVE.,That she creates the difference between
2357,LOVE.,"Immortal souls. The fiery heart of youth,"
2358,LOVE.,"Full of high aims and generous purposes of good,"
2359,LOVE.,"Swells like the ocean-waves beneath the moon,"
2360,LOVE.,"And brooketh no restraint, until it finds"
2361,LOVE.,"Its living counterpart, and mergeth all"
2362,LOVE.,"It hath of truth, and manliness, and might,"
2363,LOVE.,Into a second and a dearer self.
2364,LOVE.,
2365,LOVE.,So goes the world! and strong necessity
2366,LOVE.,"Creates the law of action, whose results"
2367,LOVE.,Join issue with the love of God himself.
2368,LOVE.,"O jealous, wanton, ill-conceited World!"
2369,LOVE.,How little dost thou understand the deep
2370,LOVE.,Significance and potency of Love!
2371,LOVE.,"Thou hast defiled thyself with gross perversions,"
2372,LOVE.,"Till purity of love is but a jest,"
2373,LOVE.,Or reckoned with the fantasies of fools.
2374,LOVE.,
2375,LOVE.,"O, I would take thee, dear Humanity,"
2376,LOVE.,And set thee face to face with perfect Love.
2377,LOVE.,She is thy mother. Love and Wisdom met
2378,LOVE.,United by Eternal Power. The worlds
2379,LOVE.,Sprang forth from chaos; and the love which brought
2380,LOVE.,Them into being doth sustain them still.
2381,LOVE.,The monad and the angel rest alike
2382,LOVE.,"Within its all-embracing arms; and life,"
2383,LOVE.,"And death, with all that makes our mortal state,"
2384,LOVE.,Are cradled at the footstool of this power.
2385,LOVE.,"Then, sweet Humanity, thou favored child"
2386,LOVE.,"Of God, look up! An everlasting chain"
2387,LOVE.,Doth bind thee to the mighty heart of all.
2388,LOVE.,Love’s labor never can be lost. He who
2389,LOVE.,"Created, shall, through Love, perfect and save;"
2390,LOVE.,"And that which hath such poor expression here,"
2391,LOVE.,Shall find fruition in a brighter sphere.

2542,RESURREXI.,“A REMARKABLE POEM.--The following striking poem was recited by Miss
2543,RESURREXI.,"Lizzie Doten, a Spiritual trance-speaker, at the close of a recent"
2544,RESURREXI.,"lecture in Boston. She professed to give it impromptu, as far as she was"
2545,RESURREXI.,"concerned, and to speak under the direct influence of Edgar A. Poe."
2546,RESURREXI.,"Whatever may be the truth about its production, the poem is, in several"
2547,RESURREXI.,"respects, a remarkable one. Miss Doten is, apparently, incapable of"
2548,RESURREXI.,"originating such a poem. If it was written for her by some one else, and"
2549,RESURREXI.,"merely committed to memory and recited by her, the poem is,"
2550,RESURREXI.,"nevertheless, wonderful as a reproduction of the singular music and"
2551,RESURREXI.,"alliteration of Poe’s style, and as manifesting the same intensity of"
2552,RESURREXI.,feeling. Whoever wrote the poem must have been exceedingly familiar with
2553,RESURREXI.,"Poe, and deeply in sympathy with his spirit. But if Miss Doten is"
2554,RESURREXI.,"honest, and the poem originated as she said it did, it is unquestionably"
2555,RESURREXI.,the most astonishing thing that Spiritualism has produced. It does not
2556,RESURREXI.,"follow, necessarily, in that case, that Poe himself made the"
2557,RESURREXI.,"poem,--although we are asked to believe a great many spiritual things on"
2558,RESURREXI.,"less cogent evidence,--but it is, in any view of it that may be taken, a"
2559,RESURREXI.,"very singular and mysterious production. There is, in the second verse,"
2560,RESURREXI.,an allusion to a previous poem that purported to come from the spirit of
2561,RESURREXI.,"Poe, which was published several years since, and attracted much"
2562,RESURREXI.,"attention, but the following poem is of a higher order, and much more"
2563,RESURREXI.,like Poe than the other.”--_Springfield Republican._
2564,RESURREXI.,
2565,RESURREXI.,
2566,RESURREXI.,"From the throne of Life Eternal,"
2567,RESURREXI.,"From the home of love supernal,"
2568,RESURREXI.,Where the angel feet make music over all the starry floor--
2569,RESURREXI.,"Mortals, I have come to meet you,"
2570,RESURREXI.,"Come with words of peace to greet you,"
2571,RESURREXI.,And to tell you of the glory that is mine forevermore.
2572,RESURREXI.,
2573,RESURREXI.,Once before I found a mortal
2574,RESURREXI.,Waiting at the heavenly portal--
2575,RESURREXI.,Waiting but to catch some echo from that ever-opening door;
2576,RESURREXI.,"Then I seized his quickened being,"
2577,RESURREXI.,"And through all his inward seeing,"
2578,RESURREXI.,Caused my burning inspiration in a fiery flood to pour!
2579,RESURREXI.,
2580,RESURREXI.,"Now I come more meekly human,"
2581,RESURREXI.,And the wreak lips of a woman
2582,RESURREXI.,"Touch with fire from off the altar, not with burnings as of yore;"
2583,RESURREXI.,"But in holy love descending,"
2584,RESURREXI.,"With her chastened being blending,"
2585,RESURREXI.,I would fill your souls with music from the bright celestial shore.
2586,RESURREXI.,
2587,RESURREXI.,"As one heart yearns for another,"
2588,RESURREXI.,"As a child turns to its mother,"
2589,RESURREXI.,"From the golden gates of glory turn I to the earth once more,"
2590,RESURREXI.,"Where I drained the cup of sadness,"
2591,RESURREXI.,"Where my soul was stung to madness,"
2592,RESURREXI.,"And life’s bitter, burning billows swept my burdened being o’er."
2593,RESURREXI.,
2594,RESURREXI.,"Here the harpies and the ravens,--"
2595,RESURREXI.,"Human vampyres, sordid cravens,--"
2596,RESURREXI.,Preyed upon my soul and substance till I writhed in anguish sore;
2597,RESURREXI.,"Life and I then seemed mismated,"
2598,RESURREXI.,"For I felt accursed and fated,"
2599,RESURREXI.,"Like a restless, wrathful spirit, wandering on the Stygian shore."
2600,RESURREXI.,
2601,RESURREXI.,"Tortured by a nameless yearning,"
2602,RESURREXI.,"Like a frost-fire, freezing, burning,"
2603,RESURREXI.,"Did the purple, pulsing life-tide through its fevered channels pour,"
2604,RESURREXI.,Till the golden bowl--Life’s token--
2605,RESURREXI.,"Into shining shards was broken,"
2606,RESURREXI.,And my chained and chafing spirit leaped from out its prison door.
2607,RESURREXI.,
2608,RESURREXI.,"But while living, striving, dying,"
2609,RESURREXI.,"Never did my soul cease crying,"
2610,RESURREXI.,"“Ye who guide the Fates and Furies, give, O give me, I implore,"
2611,RESURREXI.,"From the myriad hosts of nations,"
2612,RESURREXI.,"From the countless constellations,"
2613,RESURREXI.,"One pure spirit that can love me--one that I, too, can adore!”"
2614,RESURREXI.,
2615,RESURREXI.,Through this fervent aspiration
2616,RESURREXI.,"Found my fainting soul salvation,"
2617,RESURREXI.,For from out its blackened fire-crypts did my quickened spirit soar;
2618,RESURREXI.,And my beautiful ideal--
2619,RESURREXI.,Not too saintly to be real--
2620,RESURREXI.,Burst more brightly on my vision than the loved and lost Lenore.
2621,RESURREXI.,
2622,RESURREXI.,"’Mid the surging seas she found me,"
2623,RESURREXI.,"With the billows breaking round me,"
2624,RESURREXI.,"And my saddened, sinking spirit in her arms of love upbore;"
2625,RESURREXI.,"Like a lone one, weak and weary,"
2626,RESURREXI.,"Wandering in the midnight dreary,"
2627,RESURREXI.,"On her sinless, saintly bosom, brought me to the heavenly shore."
2628,RESURREXI.,
2629,RESURREXI.,"Like the breath of blossoms blending,"
2630,RESURREXI.,"Like the prayers of saints ascending,"
2631,RESURREXI.,"Like the rainbow’s seven-hued glory, blend our souls forevermore;"
2632,RESURREXI.,"Earthly love and lust enslaved me,"
2633,RESURREXI.,"But divinest love hath saved me,"
2634,RESURREXI.,"And I know now, first and only, how to love and to adore."
2635,RESURREXI.,
2636,RESURREXI.,"O, my mortal friends and brothers!"
2637,RESURREXI.,"We are each and all another’s,"
2638,RESURREXI.,And the soul that gives most freely from its treasure hath the more;
2639,RESURREXI.,"Would you lose your life, you find it,"
2640,RESURREXI.,"And in giving love, you bind it"
2641,RESURREXI.,"Like an amulet of safety, to your heart forevermore."

2647,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2648,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,[Given under the inspiration of Edgar A. Poe.]
2649,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2650,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"The Prophecy of Vala is founded on the Scandinavian mythology. Odin, the"
2651,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"great All Father, is the sovereign power of the universe; Thor, a lesser"
2652,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"god, of whom it is said, “his mighty hammer smote thunder out of every"
2653,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"thing.” Baldur was a son of Odin and Frigga. He was slain by Hörder, his"
2654,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"blind brother, who was persuaded to the act by Loké, an evil spirit,"
2655,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,corresponding to the Hebrew or Christian devil. The Valkyrien were the
2656,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,genii of the battle-field. The three Nornen were the Fates who watered
2657,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"the tree Yggdrasill, at whose roots it is said that a dragon was"
2658,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,constantly gnawing. The Heimskringla was the circle of the universe.
2659,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Vala was a seeress, or prophetess, who was summoned from the dead by"
2660,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Odin, to tell of the fate of Baldur; but on her appearance refused to do"
2661,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"so, and to the astonishment of all, prophesied the death of all the sons"
2662,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"of Odin at the day of Ragnaroc, which corresponds to the day of"
2663,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"judgment, with the exception that it was also the day of reconstruction,"
2664,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"or renewal of the world. The Prophecy of Vala, as given in the old"
2665,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Icelandic Edda, has been used with perfect freedom, to present the idea"
2666,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"that Good, though apparently overcome of Evil, should ultimately"
2667,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,triumph.--_Explanation by Poe._
2668,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2669,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2670,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,I have walked with the Fates and the Furies ’mid the wrecks of the
2671,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"mighty Past,"
2672,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"I have stood in the giant shadows which the ages have backward cast,"
2673,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"And I’ve heard the voices of prophets come down in a lengthening chain,"
2674,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Translating the Truth Eternal, and making its meaning plain;"
2675,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Backward still, ever backward, ’mid wreck and ruin I trod,"
2676,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Seeking Life’s secret sources, and the primal truths of God."
2677,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2678,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"“Tell me,” I cried, “O Prophet, thou shade of the mighty Past,"
2679,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,What of the Truth in the future? Is its horoscope yet cast?
2680,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Thou didst give it its birth and being, thou didst cradle it in"
2681,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,thy breast--
2682,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Show me its shining orbit, and the place of its final rest!”"
2683,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2684,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,A sound like the restless earthquake! a crash like the “crack of doom”!
2685,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,And a fiery fulmination streamed in through the frightened gloom.
2686,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"I stood in the halls of Odin, and the great All Father shone"
2687,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Like the centre and sun of Being, ’mid the glories of his throne;"
2688,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"And Thor, with his mighty hammer, upraised in his giant hand,"
2689,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Stood ready to wake the thunder at his sovereign Lord’s command.
2690,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2691,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"“Ho, Thor!” said the mighty Odin, “our omens are all of ill,"
2692,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,For the dragon gnaweth sharply at the roots of Yggdrasill;
2693,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"I hear the wild Valkyrien, as they shriek on the battle-plain,"
2694,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"And the moans of the faithful Nornen, as they weep over Baldur slain."
2695,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"A woe to the serpent Loké, and to Hörder’s reckless ruth,"
2696,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"For Goodness is slain of Evil, and Falsehood hath conquered Truth!"
2697,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Now call thou on mystic Vala, as she sleeps in the grave of Time,"
2698,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Where the hoary age hath written her name in a frosty rime;
2699,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"She can tell when the sun will darken, when the stars shall cease to burn,"
2700,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"When the sleeping dead shall waken, and when Baldur shall return.”"
2701,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2702,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"A sound like the rushing tempest, and the wondrous hammer fell,"
2703,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"And the great Heimskringla shuddered, and swayed like a mighty bell."
2704,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"There were mingled murmurs and discords, like the wailing of"
2705,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,troubled souls;
2706,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Like the gnomes at their fiery forges--like the bowlings of
2707,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,restless ghouls.
2708,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Then out of the fiery covert of the tempest and the storm,"
2709,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Like a vision of troubled slumber, came a woman’s stately form."
2710,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"There fell a hush as at midnight, when the sheeted dead awake,"
2711,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"And even the silence shuddered, as her words of power she spake:"
2712,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2713,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"“Mighty Odin, I am Vala,"
2714,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"I have heard your thunder-call,"
2715,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,I have heard the woful wailing
2716,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Sounding forth from Wingolf’s hall;
2717,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"And I know that beauteous Baldur,"
2718,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Loved of all the gods, is slain--"
2719,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"That the evil Loké triumphs,"
2720,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,And on Hörder rests the stain.
2721,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,But my words shall fail to tell you
2722,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Aught concerning him you mourn,"
2723,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,For the leaves that bear the record
2724,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,From the Tree of Life are torn;
2725,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"And while Hecla’s fires shall glow,"
2726,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Or the bubbling Geysers flow,"
2727,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Of his fate no one shall know--
2728,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Understand you this, or no?"
2729,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2730,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"“I will sing a solemn Saga,"
2731,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"I will chant a Runic rhyme,"
2732,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Weave a wild, prophetic Edda,"
2733,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,From the scattered threads of time:
2734,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Know, O Odin,--mighty Odin,--"
2735,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"That thy sons shall all be slain,"
2736,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Where the wild Valkyrien gather,"
2737,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,On the bloody battle plain;
2738,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,And thy throne itself shall tremble
2739,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"With the stern, resistless shock,"
2740,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Which shall rend the world asunder
2741,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,At the day of Ragnaroc.
2742,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Other stars the night shall know,"
2743,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"From the rock shall waters flow,"
2744,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,And from ruin beauty grow.
2745,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Understand you this, or no?"
2746,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2747,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,“Vainly shall the faithful Nornen
2748,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Water drooping Yggdrasill,"
2749,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"For the wrathful, restless dragon"
2750,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,At its roots is gnawing still.
2751,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Loké’s evil arts shall triumph,"
2752,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Hörder’s eyes be dark with night,"
2753,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Till the day of re-creation
2754,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Brings the buried Truth to light:
2755,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Then a greater god than Odin,"
2756,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Over all the worlds shall reign,"
2757,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"And my Saga’s mystic meaning,"
2758,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,As the sunlight shall be plain.
2759,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Out of evil good shall grow--
2760,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Doubt me not, for time shall show."
2761,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Understand you this, or no?"
2762,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Fare you well! I go--I go!”
2763,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2764,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"There came a voice as of thunder, with a gleam of lurid light,"
2765,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,And the mystic Vala vanished like a meteor of the night;
2766,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Then I saw that the truth of the present is but the truth of the past,"
2767,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"But each phase is greater, and grander, and mightier than the last--"
2768,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"That the past is ever prophetic of that which is yet to be,"
2769,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,And that God reveals his glory by slow and distinct degree;
2770,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Yet still are the nations weeping o’er the graves of the Truth and Right:
2771,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Lo! I summon another Vala--let her prophesy to-night.
2772,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"With the amaranth, and the myrtle, and the asphodel on her brow,"
2773,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Still wet with the dew of the kingdom, doth she stand before you now:"
2774,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2775,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"“Not with sound of many thunders,"
2776,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Not with miracles and wonders,"
2777,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,Would I herald forth my coming from the peaceful spirit-shore;
2778,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"But in God’s own love descending,"
2779,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"With your aspirations blending,"
2780,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"I would teach you of the future, that you watch and weep no more."
2781,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2782,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,“God is God from the creation;
2783,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Truth, alone, is man’s salvation:"
2784,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,But the God that now you worship soon shall be your God no more;
2785,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"For the soul, in its unfolding,"
2786,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Evermore its thought remoulding,"
2787,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Learns more truly, in its progress, ‘how to love and to adore!’"
2788,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,
2789,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"“Evil is of Good, twin brother,"
2790,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Born of God, and of none other:"
2791,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"And though Truth seems slain of Error, through the ills that men deplore,"
2792,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Yet, still nearer to perfection,"
2793,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"She shall know a resurrection,"
2794,THE PROPHECY OF VALA.,"Passing on from ceaseless glory, unto glory evermore."

3004,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,"not generally known, it may be well to present the facts in connection"
3005,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,with the following poem. Having occasion to pass through Baltimore a few
3006,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,days before his intended marriage with a lady of family and fortune in
3007,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,"Virginia, Poe met with some of his old associates, who induced him to"
3008,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,"drink with them, although, as we are informed, he had entirely abstained"
3009,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,for a year. This aroused the appetite which had so long slumbered within
3010,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,"him, and in a short time he wandered forth into the street in a state of"
3011,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,"drunken delirium, and was found next morning literally dying from"
3012,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,"exposure. He was taken to a hospital, and on the 7th of October, 1849,"
3013,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,"at the age of thirty-eight, he closed his troubled life. The tortures"
3014,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,and terrors of that night of suffering are vividly portrayed in the
3015,THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.,"following poem, composed in spirit-life, and given by him through the"

3160,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","life, and with which he has become familiar through experience. But as"
3161,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","it was in the days when Jesus lived and taught, or when Paul wrote his"
3162,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Epistle to Timothy, so Godliness, to the great mass of minds, remains a"
3163,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","mystery. When Paul penned those words,--“Without controversy, great is"
3164,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the mystery of Godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in"
3165,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in"
3166,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the world, and received up into glory,”--he referred particularly to the"
3167,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","life and teachings of Jesus. We, however, give to the passage a more"
3168,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",comprehensive and extended application. If the “Mystery of Godliness”
3169,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","was made manifest in the life of Jesus because of his divinity, then do"
3170,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","we say to the men of the present day, “Beloved, now are ye also sons of"
3171,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","God.” And if “the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in the midst of men,”"
3172,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, so that same Word is incarnated, in"
3173,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","greater or less degree, in every human being, be he rich or poor, black"
3174,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","or white, bond or free. In the same way, also, every one possessing a"
3175,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",living soul is a manifestation of the mystery of Godliness. And when a
3176,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","man goes into his own nature, when he understands himself, when he reads"
3177,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the mysteries of his own being, when he looks away from his positive and"
3178,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","earthly necessities up to his Divine possibilities, and sees how vast is"
3179,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the range, how infinite his capabilities, then he begins to understand"
3180,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",something of the mysteries of Godliness. The Church has used this
3181,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","phraseology in the past, and knew not what it meant. She had “the form"
3182,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","of Godliness,” and yet in word and deed, ay, in very thought, she"
3183,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","“denied the power thereof.” Therefore it has been, in all past time,"
3184,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","when there were some true and sincere souls in the Church, who made"
3185,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","manifest, both by profession and practice, that in part at least, they"
3186,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","comprehended the mystery of Godliness, which is the highest"
3187,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spirituality,--not Spiritualism,--and let it flow out into the beauty"
3188,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","and harmony of perfect lives, the Church looked at them with a doubtful"
3189,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","countenance. There was such a thing as being too holy, and the Church"
3190,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",felt that such lives were a reproach to her self-righteousness and
3191,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",hypocrisy. She was not familiar with the manifestation of true
3192,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Godliness, and consequently looked upon it as something that threatened"
3193,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","her internal peace, and the success of her stereotyped plan of"
3194,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","salvation. Therefore it was, that the voice of condemnation was raised"
3195,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","against Michael De Molinos, Fenelon, Madame Guyon, and the whole host of"
3196,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Quietists and Reformers. By dim forecastings of the soul, and heroic"
3197,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","struggling with flesh and sense, they had learned something of that holy"
3198,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",mystery. It was that which could not be translated into human language.
3199,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","It could not be written in books, but it was that which was to be felt"
3200,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","in the soul, and made manifest in the life. Godliness, true"
3201,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spirituality, cannot find expression in words, and so it must of"
3202,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",necessity manifest its Divine beauty in the life.
3203,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3204,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",But what is the idea we intend to convey when we use the term
3205,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","“Godliness”? Who is God, from whose name this word is simply a"
3206,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",derivative? Godliness is the manifestation of his spirit and power in
3207,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the soul of man, yet it is not God. Who, then, is He! We must look into"
3208,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",the lexicon of every human heart to find our reply; for each one
3209,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",worships his own Ideal of Deity according to the revelation of Truth
3210,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","which he receives, and to the capacity of his spirit to comprehend. The"
3211,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",old philosophers sought for God in all the external world; they also
3212,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","went down into the mysteries of the spirit, as far as philosophy could"
3213,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","sound its mighty depths, and yet they could not fathom his infinite"
3214,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",nature. Although form and an external are necessary to man as a
3215,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","completion of his idea, yet when he reasons deeply concerning Deity, he"
3216,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",cannot arrive at any satisfactory conclusions concerning his
3217,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","personality; he can only worship him as a principle, as a presence, and"
3218,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","a power. Man, in his insignificance, can only look up to that superior"
3219,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Intelligence, which manifests itself throughout Nature, and worship"
3220,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",either in the silence of the heart or in the inadequate articulations of
3221,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",human speech. The finite never did as yet compass and comprehend the
3222,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",Infinite. And before that majestic question which all the Ages have
3223,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","sought in vain to answer, before that mighty Oracle whose essence and"
3224,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","nature have never been understood, man might as well remain dumb."
3225,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3226,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","But where, you ask, shall man find his highest manifestation of Deity?"
3227,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","How shall he know and understand God, so that he may attain unto the"
3228,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",true mystery of Godliness? The most of God that you can know is through
3229,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",your own souls. Your neighbor may speak unto you of the influences which
3230,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","flow in upon him from the great Soul of all; you can only listen, but"
3231,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","cannot comprehend, unless there is something of the same spirit--of the"
3232,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",same Divine life within you. But as you grow in goodness and
3233,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spirituality, you comprehend more clearly the truth which Jesus, the"
3234,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","greatest Medium the world ever knew, spoke to the ears of men, when he"
3235,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","said, “God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in"
3236,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",spirit and in truth.” Therefore our definition of Godliness is
3237,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spirituality, the influence of God felt in the soul and made manifest in"
3238,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",the life of man. Just in proportion as this principle or power is
3239,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","realized in the hearts of men, they approach nearer unto Deity; they see"
3240,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",more of his perfect life; they understand more of his ways; they leave
3241,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","speculations concerning his personality, and go away to those great"
3242,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",generalizations whereby a man’s soul grows comprehensive and universal
3243,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","in its sympathies, and beholds the operations of the Infinite mind in"
3244,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","all things. Thus, as Jesus was a manifestation of that Godliness or"
3245,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spirituality, the self-same Divine power--the “Divine in the human” is"
3246,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",manifest in every sentient being.
3247,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3248,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","And here we approach a mighty truth, in whose majestic presence we feel"
3249,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",inclined to lay aside our dusty sandals; for the place whereon we stand
3250,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","seems holy ground. While studying the mysteries of our own being, we"
3251,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","find that necessarily we worship Everlasting Truth, in whatever form it"
3252,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","may be presented. We go away from limitations, we go away from sects and"
3253,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","creeds, from tottering institutions and the musty theologies of the"
3254,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","past, and stand face to face with that fresher revelation of Deity in"
3255,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",the heart. Then it is that man feels there are primary and fundamental
3256,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","truths lying at the basis of all philosophy and all religion, and only"
3257,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",as he builds upon these broad foundations can he rear a glorious
3258,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","superstructure against which all the winds of changing theories, and the"
3259,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","descending floods of mere speculative philosophy, will not be able to"
3260,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","prevail. As man, like one initiated into the mysteries of Masonry,"
3261,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","enters into this lodge of freedom, he begins to believe in himself. No"
3262,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",man can have faith in God who has no faith in himself; that is the first
3263,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",step towards the Divine. You take that step in the secret of the soul
3264,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","when you first acknowledge the “Divine in the human,” and confess its"
3265,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",supporting influence.
3266,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3267,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","For instance, two men may be standing on the borders of a precipice:"
3268,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","below, there is the deep ravine; opposite, the other side of the"
3269,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","mountain. They look far down and see rough, ragged points of rocks, and"
3270,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","far, far below, the floods boiling white with foam. Over this abyss"
3271,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","there is but one slight, frail bridge, and that is the trunk of a single"
3272,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","tree. One man says, “Since we must pass over, I will precede. I know"
3273,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",that I can go; I _will_ go.” That man has faith in himself. He plants
3274,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","his feet firmly; he looks upward, and passes safely over. The second"
3275,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","says, “I do not believe that I can go; I fear I shall fall.” He totters"
3276,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","on, trembling, until he reaches the middle, and then cries out, “O Lord,"
3277,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Lord, help me!” So surely as he utters that cry, faithless in his own"
3278,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","power, that man must fall."
3279,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3280,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","And thus it is with human souls. They are standing here, in earthly"
3281,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","life, gazing across the great abyss of the Future. It is dark and"
3282,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","terrible below. They cannot clearly understand what fate awaits them,"
3283,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",but they see the strait and narrow way before them. If a man plants his
3284,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","feet firmly, and says, “I can, and I will,” it is the greatest possible"
3285,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",acknowledgement of his faith in God. That man has stepped upon the
3286,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",threshold of the mysteries of Godliness; those mysteries will be made
3287,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","clearer and more apparent to his soul as he advances. But if, with"
3288,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","craven soul, he says, “I know not what to do. I will wait for God’s"
3289,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","providences, and let them come as they may; for of myself I can do"
3290,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","nothing,”--if he trust to the vicarious atonement and an external Deity,"
3291,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","and does nothing for his own salvation,--if, in making oral prayers to"
3292,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the Lord of the Universe, he forgets to “worship God in spirit,” and"
3293,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","loses the vitalizing consciousness of the Divine within his own being,"
3294,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","that man will assuredly err; he will continually go astray, for"
3295,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","externally he has “the form of Godliness,” but practically and"
3296,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",internally he denies “the power thereof.”
3297,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3298,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","The world to-day is standing, in a certain sense, in that same position."
3299,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Men are lifting up their hands, and crying, “Lord, Lord!” believing that"
3300,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","they shall thus enter into the kingdom, while within their own beings"
3301,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",there is a broad region of spiritual mysteries unknown and unexplored.
3302,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Here and there are instances where souls, driven by the action of their"
3303,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","own importunate reason,--ay, we may say, by simple common sense,--have"
3304,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","turned aside from creeds and theories, and have inquired earnestly of"
3305,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",Nature and of the God within. It is refreshing at times to find such a
3306,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","soul: one that believes in the inspiration of the living Word,"
3307,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","incarnated in all flesh, and made apparent throughout the universe,--not"
3308,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","a Pantheist, believing in the manifestation of Deity in Nature alone,"
3309,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","and in nothing higher, but realizing that the creation is the"
3310,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","perceptible and external revelation of Deity; believing, with the German"
3311,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","philosopher Fichte, that “there is a Divine Idea pervading this visible"
3312,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",universe; which visible universe is indeed but its symbol and sensible
3313,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","manifestation, having in itself no meaning, or even true existence,"
3314,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","independent of it. To the mass of men this Divine Idea lies hidden; yet,"
3315,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","to discern it, to seize it, and live wholly in it, is the condition of"
3316,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","all genuine virtue, knowledge, freedom, and the end, therefore, of all"
3317,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spiritual effort in every age.” He who lives and dwells in this Idea,"
3318,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",enters into the mysteries of Godliness. All divine things are
3319,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",exceedingly simple when they are known. It is because men are looking
3320,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",too high that they do not receive the living inspirations of the Truth;
3321,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","they turn away from themselves, and neglect to observe the manifestation"
3322,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",of the spirit within their own being. They look upon their brother man
3323,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","or sister woman, and forget to exercise that broad charity which sees"
3324,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the spirit struggling with the flesh, or feebly breasting the wild waves"
3325,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","of a tempestuous life, simply because it was thus constituted and"
3326,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","surrounded. Men commonly judge from their own individual stand-point,"
3327,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","instead of going away back to the Divinity of the inner life, and from"
3328,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",its pure eyes looking into the heart of their erring brother or sister.
3329,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","He who simply criticizes the man, and judges him by the limitations of"
3330,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","his own life, errs greatly. But he who looks beyond and behind him, sees"
3331,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","that there are truths, and principles, and powers, and loving, earnest"
3332,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spirits, who are endeavoring to make manifest their inspiration through"

3334,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","erratic and wandering, it is only through the excess of power that"
3335,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",cannot find an appropriate manifestation through such an organization.
3336,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3337,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","And such a one was he of whom we speak to-night,--that erratic genius,"
3338,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","EDGAR A. POE. The mysteries of Godliness,--not of morality, as the world"
3339,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","understands it,--confounded him. He could see more clearly than most of"
3340,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","men. He looked out into the vast arcana of Nature, and his soul trembled"
3341,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","before the majestic revelation. He knew not how to express, in any"
3342,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","adequate form of speech, those great and mighty thoughts which rose and"
3343,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","shone, like stars of wondrous beauty, in his soul; he knew not how to"
3344,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",give his burning inspirations a manifestation through his life and
3345,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",being.
3346,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3347,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",Edgar A. Poe was a medium. “A medium!” you say. “He himself would scorn
3348,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the name; and we, who knew him, deny it.” But of what was he a medium?"
3349,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",We do not confine ourselves to that definition of the term given by
3350,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",modern Spiritualists. He was a medium for the general inspiration which
3351,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","sets like a current of living fire through the universe. No special, no"
3352,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","individual spirit wrought directly upon him, but he felt the might and"
3353,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","majesty of occult forces from the world of causes, and trembled beneath"
3354,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","their influence. He was a medium, not to disembodied spirits, only so"
3355,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","far as mind acts upon mind by the great law of unity, and in the same"
3356,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",way was he psychologically affected by spirits in the body. He had a
3357,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","peculiarly sensitive and impressible nature, and in the mysteries of a"
3358,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spirituality which he did not seek to comprehend, he was easily wrought"
3359,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","upon by the minds around him. Not but what he possessed self-will; not,"
3360,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","indeed, that he lacked that firmness, whereby, when his soul was"
3361,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","aroused, he could repel such influences. But his nature was so finely"
3362,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","strung that every harsh word, every unkindly discord, grated and"
3363,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","thrilled through his entire being, so that oftentimes it would seem as"
3364,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","though he would beat down the wall of clay to give his spirit freedom,"
3365,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",and to escape forever from the inharmonious influences of the
3366,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","world,--from the presence of those by whom he was so little understood."
3367,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3368,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","It is difficult to comprehend such natures, for they are not common."
3369,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","But, alas for such! They have no choice but to be denizens of this"
3370,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","world, and all the rough, sharp angles of rude Humanity seem continually"
3371,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","to wound and irritate their sensitiveness, torturing them almost to"
3372,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","madness. And yet there is a deep, strong under-current to their lives."
3373,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",There is a beautiful spirituality which leads men to perceive that there
3374,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",is a power in the universe which balances all these inequalities and
3375,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","apparent inharmonies of human beings; and so, although they are set at"
3376,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","variance with the world in certain portions of their nature, yet they"
3377,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",are rewarded in others. Edgar A. Poe possessed the power of retiring
3378,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",from external things into the mysteries of the spirit. The greatest
3379,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","authors and musical composers the world ever knew, were those whose"
3380,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",favorite pursuit so completely absorbed them that all external things
3381,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","were excluded, and they forgot, while their inspirations were upon them,"
3382,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","what manner of men they were,--forgot the necessities of the flesh, and"
3383,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",all the surroundings of their daily lives. Such men could understand our
3384,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","meaning, when we say that Edgar A. Poe lived much in his inner life, and"
3385,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","there, as in the experience of the soul-rapt and inspired Boehmen,"
3386,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",glorious revelations of the sublime and the beautiful were made manifest
3387,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",unto him. The common forms of human speech were inadequate for
3388,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","expression; therefore he seized upon the secret harmony of words, and"
3389,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","strung them like flashing gems on the golden line of his thought,"
3390,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","weaving them into wild, strange metaphors, oftentimes so bewildering and"
3391,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","dazzling, that the common mind could only feel the charm without"
3392,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","comprehending the mystery. Like Ezekiel in his vision, he beheld the"
3393,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","wondrous “living creatures, and the wheels,” and as they were"
3394,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","represented, so did he describe them; but the mind of the reader must be"
3395,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",in a similar state of illumination in order to clearly understand his
3396,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",meaning. There were seasons when he seemed to enter into a peaceful
3397,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",alliance with earth and all harmonious and beautiful things. Yet when
3398,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","his peculiarly sensitive nature was startled and aroused, he turned back"
3399,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","to this Valhalla of his soul, and there he found another element of"
3400,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","peace,--a strange, paradoxical peace, which comes through the herculean"
3401,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","efforts of the soul to clamber up the rugged heights of destiny,--such"
3402,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","peace as is given unto souls, when the angel, with a flaming sword,"
3403,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",drives them from the Eden places of this world back into the mysteries
3404,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","of their being, in order that from their bloody sweat and bitter agony"
3405,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","they may wring out great songs of moving inspiration, and reveal to"
3406,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",mankind generally the wondrous world of ideas and causes which lies
3407,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",beyond the limits of sense and the range of external observation.
3408,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3409,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",All such are men of Destiny. They are compelled over the ways which they
3410,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","tread. The world looks upon them, and cannot understand them; men"
3411,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",consider them as anomalies and strange inconsistencies; as abnormal
3412,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",manifestations of the spirit. Yet “for this cause came they into the
3413,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","world;” and as poets, and artists, and musical composers are born with"
3414,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the undeveloped elements of their genius within them, so particular"
3415,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","souls, in close connection with the spiritual world, who are continually"
3416,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","receiving direct impressions and revelations from the sphere of causes,"
3417,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",are born such from their cradle; and thus the mystery of spirituality or
3418,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","godliness, as the world passes on generation after generation, is"
3419,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",becoming more and more apparent in the lives and experiences of men.
3420,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","When we speak of spirituality, do not consider that we mean modern"
3421,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Spiritualism, as understood by the world, which has furnished any amount"
3422,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",of sheep’s clothing to the wolves who desire to prey upon the lambs in
3423,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",the unguarded fold of Humanity. Neither do we mean that inflated
3424,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spirituality, which, in its zeal for reform, and contempt for ceremonies"
3425,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","and limitations, rushes to extremes, and, deceiving itself, “uses its"
3426,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",liberty as an occasion to the flesh.” But we do mean that living
3427,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","principle, which makes itself manifest in high-toned souls, whose"
3428,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",sublime aspirations exalt the whole life above the common level of
3429,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Humanity. It may come out as a fitful and glimmering light, but it shows"
3430,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","that the Divine inspiration is there, and all men, when they perceive"
3431,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","it, are ready to acknowledge it as genuine. Whatever is truly good,"
3432,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","glorious, or divine, that which possesses in itself real merit and"
3433,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","inspiration, cannot fail to find a responsive echo. And thus was it with"
3434,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the writings of Poe. When, from the glowing fire-crypts of his soul, he"
3435,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","wrought out, with master strokes, his “Raven,” and gave it to the world,"
3436,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","men felt that there was the ring of true genius. And, although it was"
3437,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the utterance of a nature at variance with its earthy surroundings, and"
3438,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","tortured by its own sensibility, yet because of its gloomy grandeur and"
3439,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","euphonious rhythm, the poem could not fail to be appreciated."
3440,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3441,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",Such natures cannot live long in the flesh. They are like two-edged
3442,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","swords, which wear upon the scabbard. There is ever an unseen hand upon"
3443,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the hilt, and finally, when the word of command is given, the sword is"
3444,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","drawn, and becomes a most effective instrument in the hand of"
3445,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",Everlasting Truth; then the individual nature that has so long battled
3446,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the stormy elements of mortal life first perceives its advantages, and"
3447,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",in the triumphant exultation which spirits always feel when freed from
3448,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the fetters of mortality, it exclaims, “O Death! where is thy sting? O"
3449,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",Grave! where is thy victory?” That diviner spirituality which was
3450,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","obscured by the flesh, which was crushed down by earthly circumstances,"
3451,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","at length frees itself, and starts up in all its majesty and glory. But"
3452,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",the mysterious growth and development of the spirit does not end here.
3453,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3454,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",Perhaps in this connection we may present to you certain points from
3455,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",which you will feel obliged to dissent. They may seem like vague
3456,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","theories and wild speculations, yet they are truths which you are yet to"
3457,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","realize in your eternal experience,--truths which this one of whom we"
3458,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",speak will present to you in repetition to-night.
3459,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3460,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",There is a power in man which is closely connected with the things of
3461,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","external life, and draws inspiration from nature and the associations of"
3462,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","his fellow-men. There is a power, also, in every human being superior to"
3463,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the spirit, and that is the soul, or innermost life--which is a divine"
3464,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","and indestructible principle. When, therefore, the garment of flesh is"
3465,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","laid aside,--when the mortal puts on its immortality,--the spirit goes"
3466,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",forth precisely as it is. If it has been under the influence of
3467,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","ungoverned passion; if it has striven, through mad ambition, to attain"
3468,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","to some cherished ideal, still does it feel that impetus, and its"
3469,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",earthly longings and aspirations must pass away through a gradual
3470,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","transformation. You may dissent from this, but the change of the earthly"
3471,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","garment does not effect a radical change in the spirit. And thus, as the"
3472,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spirit of Edgar A. Poe started forth on its celestial journey, all that"
3473,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",bound him to earth still held a certain degree of influence over him.
3474,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","“Life is one eternal progress,” and only by progression and the gradual"
3475,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",development of his nobler nature could he outlive that bondage. In many
3476,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",respects he had loved life and the things of earth. In his intercourse
3477,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",with men he could not free himself from “the sins which did so easily
3478,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",beset him.” Neither could he restrain that sensitiveness and
3479,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",irritability of nature which so often destroyed the peace of his outer
3480,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","and inner life, and therefore he must necessarily outgrow that in higher"
3481,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","conditions, and under more favorable influences. As he gradually"
3482,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","attained to a sublimer consciousness of the beautiful and true, much of"
3483,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","the wild and fitful fire peculiar to his genius departed from him, and"
3484,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","there came in its stead a majestic flow of inspiration, solemn and grand"
3485,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",as the music of the spheres. He saw that there were harmonious relations
3486,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","awaiting him; and as his soul was rich in sympathy and love, he aspired"
3487,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","to those conditions, and he could not rest until he had attained unto"
3488,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","them. The hinderance to his perfect peace was in his own spirit, and he"
3489,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","realized it. It was for him the commencement of a mighty struggle,--"
3490,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3491,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","“When the golden bowl,--life’s token,--"
3492,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",Into shining shards was broken.”
3493,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3494,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","It would seem, then, as though conscious of his strength, he stood up"
3495,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","like a spiritual giant, exclaiming, “I am free! At last I am free!”"
3496,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",There was a complete expansion of his being as he drank in the celestial
3497,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",air. He could not clearly understand the mysteries by which he was
3498,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","surrounded, but he knew that there was a latent energy in his soul,"
3499,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","which, being more fully developed, would wrestle with these mighty"
3500,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","problems until he made the solution his own. As year after year, marking"
3501,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","great and important changes in human experience, rolled on, men who"
3502,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","remembered Poe as he was, said, “Now he rests from life’s labor; now he"
3503,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",sins and sorrows no more.”
3504,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3505,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","But they did not know upon what a mighty battle-field he stood, neither"
3506,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",could they understand through what fires of purification he was passing.
3507,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","But there he stood, contending bravely, not once losing faith in his"
3508,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","soul’s possibilities, and pressing earnestly forward to the desired"
3509,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","consummation. And in this he was not alone. O, no! There was with him a"
3510,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","whole host of moral heroes, who, conscious of their power to win the"
3511,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","victory, and quickened by the inspirations which they received from that"
3512,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","higher state of being, were striving, by the excelsior movement of the"
3513,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","soul, to attain to those glory-encircled heights from whence they could"
3514,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",look calmly down upon the plane of their earthly existence.
3515,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3516,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Thus it was that, as they gradually arose higher and higher in the scale"
3517,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","of being, he and they could perceive that all sin, and sorrow, and evil"
3518,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","ended at length in blessing, and that truths, which were dim and"
3519,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","indistinct, which seemed aught but truths, came out into clear and"
3520,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","shining light, and in their heavens were stars of the first magnitude."
3521,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Thus, also, as he toiled on he became versed in the mysteries of the"
3522,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spirit, not in mere moralities--for true religion, godliness or"
3523,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","spirituality, is the full, free, and complete development of man’s"
3524,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","entire being, both in the intellectual and moral. Science and"
3525,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","literature, art and religion, have been separated by mankind, because"
3526,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",they did not understand the true mystery of Godliness.
3527,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3528,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","But in that higher life one of the first lessons taught to the soul is,"
3529,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","that all things have their uses. Even the low, animal passions, leading"
3530,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","man into error, into sin, sensuality, and evil, will thereby teach him"
3531,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","lessons of wisdom; will teach him to avoid the false and the untrue, and"
3532,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",also that there were rocks and quicksands upon which his bark had
3533,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","almost foundered, and which in the future he must avoid. Whether it be"
3534,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","these lower passions, or the intellectual and moral, still each must"
3535,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",have its own appropriate manifestation.
3536,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3537,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",And as all these capacities for growth and perception belong not to the
3538,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","body but to the spirit, so the spirit, sweeping away into the great"
3539,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Eternity, bears up all these powers of its wondrous mechanism with it,"
3540,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",and the vision of Ezekiel is realized; for “the living creature being
3541,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","lifted up, the wheels are lifted up also.”"
3542,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3543,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Each organ of the brain has its own magnetic circle, touching the one"
3544,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","upon another like the mechanism of a watch, and all governed by the"
3545,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","main-spring, which is the internal consciousness of man, the central"
3546,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",power of his being. This order in the change from the mortal to the
3547,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","immortal is not lost, but finds a more harmonious surrounding. Thus,"
3548,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","when the spirit has ascended, with its increased power, with its"
3549,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",superior opportunities for observation and investigation of all the
3550,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","truths of the universe, it learns this most important truth,--that not"
3551,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","in _one_ direction, but in _all_, the spirit shall find its most free"
3552,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",and perfect development.
3553,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3554,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Thus having become familiar with the conditions of the higher life, the"
3555,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",one of whom we speak realized that it was not in the poetic element of
3556,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","his being alone that he was to find inspiration, not in smooth flowing"
3557,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","numbers or cunning arrangements of human speech, but in the grand"
3558,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",harmony of the living whole--the perfect accord of his entire being. It
3559,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","was necessary, in passing forth from the flesh, that he should learn"
3560,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",this simple lesson. He has endeavored by all the powers of his nature to
3561,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",make its application; and he has succeeded. This night he gives his
3562,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",“Farewell to Earth.” Not that he is to be divided forever in his
3563,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","interest from Humanity, but, no longer incited by restlessness or"
3564,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","ambition, to express in rhythmic numbers the fiery thought within, no"
3565,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","longer drawn by the sordid interests of this earthly life, he can gaze"
3566,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","down upon this lower world and influence the minds of men, and still be"
3567,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","above them. He can still minister, as an Everlasting Truth and living"
3568,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","power, to the needs of Humanity; but as Poe, the individual, he is"
3569,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","willing to be forgotten. His personality, as far as human recognition is"
3570,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","concerned, can end here. He cares not that “this poor, paltry _me_"
3571,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","should be spun out into Infinity.” He says: “Let my soul speak, which"
3572,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",is the Divine Power. I have realized in myself the mysteries of
3573,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Godliness, and know now that I too am Divine. I have merged and lost my"
3574,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",will in the Great Will of the universe. I know now what heaven is; it is
3575,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","beauty, perfection, harmony. I would live forever in that celestial air,"
3576,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",and draw in the vitalizing influences of truth. I do not desire to go
3577,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","down to the lowly homes of earth, nor to mingle with men in their"
3578,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",contentions and selfish interests. I know that there is a Power guarding
3579,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","and guiding all things, and I can trust those whom I have loved, or"
3580,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","those for whom I have cared, in that Almighty Hand. Whatever mysterious"
3581,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",manifestation of wisdom on the part of Divine Providence comes to
3582,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Humanity, I can say now, ‘It is well! Let the will of that Power be"
3583,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",done!’ I have then no work to perform for you. I have only to carry with
3584,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","me through the vast Eternity an open nature, that I may receive truths,"
3585,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","and, in passing onward, transmit them to those who are to follow after"
3586,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",me.”
3587,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3588,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","Thus it is with all great and earnest souls. “The mystery of Godliness,”"
3589,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","or true spirituality, as an impelling and inspiring power, is behind"
3590,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","them, making itself manifest through their being. It also stands before"
3591,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","them, beckoning them on the way. It may be they have natures of steel"
3592,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","and fire, and that a thought electric strikes upon the heart, and sits,"
3593,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","a mania, on the brain. But still they feel that power impelling and"
3594,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","persuading, and finally when they perceive that the grand current of"
3595,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","human events is tending towards the great ocean of Infinite Truth, they"
3596,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",are willing to let their own peculiarities and characteristic tendencies
3597,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","also flow on in the great stream, and so harmony is at length"
3598,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","established, not only with themselves but all."
3599,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",
3600,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","The lesson of Poe’s life, in itself, was worth much to Humanity. In"
3601,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","coming time, others besides ourselves will dissect and analyze his"
3602,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","peculiar nature, and present it, even as we have, to men, as an instance"
3603,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.","of that Spirit which was “made manifest in the flesh, which was seen of"

3606,"M., NOV. 2, 1863.",Godliness! great in the light of the human lives that come and go upon

3665,FAREWELL TO EARTH.,
3666,I.,I.
3667,I.,
3668,I.,Farewell! Farewell!
3669,I.,Like the music of a bell
3670,I.,Floating downward to the dell--
3671,I.,"Downward from some Alpine height,"
3672,I.,"While the sunset-embers bright,"
3673,I.,Fade upon the hearth of night;
3674,I.,"So my spirit, voiceless--breathless,--"
3675,I.,"Indestructible and deathless,"
3676,I.,From the heights of Life Elysian gives to Earth my parting song;
3677,I.,"Downward through the star-lit spaces,"
3678,I.,"Unto Earth’s most lowly places,"
3679,I.,"Like the sun-born strains of Memnon, let the music float along,"
3680,I.,"With a wild and wayward rhythm, with a movement deep and strong."
3681,I.,“Come up higher!” cry the angels.--This must be my parting song.
3682,I.,
3683,I.,Earth! O Earth! thou art my Mother.
3684,I.,Mortal man! thou art my Brother.
3685,I.,"We have shared a mutual sorrow, we have known a common birth;"
3686,I.,"Yet with all my soul’s endeavor,"
3687,I.,"I will sunder, and forever,"
3688,I.,Every tie of human passion that can bind my soul to Earth--
3689,I.,Every slavish tie that binds me to the things of little worth.
3690,I.,“Come up higher!” cry the angels: “come! and bid farewell to Earth.”
3691,I.,
3692,I.,I would bear a love Platonic to the souls in earthly life;
3693,I.,I would give a sign Masonic to the heroes in the strife;
3694,I.,"I have been their fellow-craftsman, bound apprentice to that Art,"
3695,I.,"Whereby Life, that cunning draughtsman, builds his temple in the heart."
3696,I.,"But with Earth no longer mated, I have passed the First Degree;"
3697,I.,I have been initiated to the second mystery.
3698,I.,"O, its high and holy meaning not one soul shall fail to see!"
3699,I.,"Now, with loftiest aspirations, onward through the worlds I march,"
3700,I.,"Through the countless constellations, upward to the Royal Arch."
3701,I.,“Come up higher!” cry the angels: “come up to the Royal Arch.”
3702,I.,
3703,I.,
3704,II.,II.
3705,II.,
3706,II.,Farewell! Farewell!
3707,II.,"Like the tolling of a bell,"
3708,II.,"Sounding forth some funeral knell,--"
3709,II.,"Tolling with a sad refrain,"
3710,II.,"Not for those who rest from pain,"
3711,II.,But for those who still remain;
3712,II.,So sweet pathos would I borrow
3713,II.,"From the loving lips of Sorrow,"
3714,II.,"Weaving in a plaintive minor with the cadence of my song,"
3715,II.,"For the souls that lonely languish,"
3716,II.,"For the hearts that break with anguish,"
3717,II.,"For the weak ones and the tempted, who must sin and suffer long;"
3718,II.,"For the hosts of living martyrs, groaning ’neath some ancient wrong;"
3719,II.,"For the cowards and the cravens, who in guilt alone are strong."
3720,II.,"But from all Earth’s woe and sadness,"
3721,II.,"All its folly and its madness,"
3722,II.,"I would never strive to save you, or avert the evil blow;"
3723,II.,"Even if I would, I could not,"
3724,II.,"Even if I could, I would not"
3725,II.,"Turn the course of Time’s great river, in its grand, majestic flow;"
3726,II.,Grapple with those mighty causes whose results I may not know:
3727,II.,"All Life’s sorrows end in blessing, as the future yet shall show."
3728,II.,
3729,II.,"From Life’s overflowing beaker I have drained the bitter draught,"

3731,II.,"I have felt the hot blood rushing o’er its red and rameous path,"
3732,II.,"Like the molten lava, gushing in its wild, volcanic wrath;"
3733,II.,"Like a bubbling, boiling Geyser, in the regions of the pole;"
3734,II.,"Like a Scylla or Charybdis, threatening to ingulf my soul."
3735,II.,"O, for all such fire-wrought natures let my rhythmic numbers toll!"
3736,II.,"Vulnerable, like Achilles, only in one fatal part,"
3737,II.,"I was wounded, by Life’s arrows, in the head, but not the heart."
3738,II.,“Come up higher!” cried the angels;--and I hastened to depart.
3739,II.,
3740,II.,
3741,III.,III.
3742,III.,
3743,III.,Farewell! farewell!
3744,III.,"Like a merry marriage-bell,"
3745,III.,"Pealing with a tuneful swell,"
3746,III.,"Telling, in a joyful strain,"
3747,III.,"With a whispered, sweet refrain,"
3748,III.,Of the hearts no longer twain;
3749,III.,"So no longer cursed and fated,"
3750,III.,"Fondly loved and truly mated,"
3751,III.,"I can pour my inspirations, free as Orpheus, through my strain."
3752,III.,Gifted with a sense of seeing
3753,III.,"Far beyond my earthly being,"
3754,III.,"I can feel I have not suffered, loved, and hoped, and feared in vain;"
3755,III.,Every earthly sin and sorrow I can only count as gain:
3756,III.,I can chant a grand “Te Deum” o’er the record of my pain.
3757,III.,
3758,III.,"Ye who grope in darkness blindly,"
3759,III.,"Ye who seek a refuge kindly,"
3760,III.,"Ye upon whose hearts the ravens--ghostly ravens--perch and prey,"
3761,III.,"Listen! for the bells are ringing,"
3762,III.,"Tuneful as the angels singing,"
3763,III.,"Ringing in the glorious morning of your spirit’s marriage-day,"
3764,III.,"When the soul, no longer fettered to the feeble form of clay,"
3765,III.,"To a high, harmonious union, soars, elate with hope away."
3766,III.,"Where the iris arch of Beauty bridges o’er celestial skies,"
3767,III.,"Where the golden line of Duty, like a living pathway lies,"
3768,III.,"Where the gonfalons of Glory float upon the fragrant air,"
3769,III.,"Ye who read Life’s lengthening story, find a Royal Chapter there."
3770,III.,Ye shall see how men and nations o’er the ways of life advance;
3771,III.,"Ye shall watch the constellations in their mazy, mystic dance;"
3772,III.,And the Central Sun shall greet you--greet you with a golden glance.
3773,III.,"O, for souls in Life Eternal let the bells in gladness ring!"
3774,III.,"Bind the wreath of orange blossoms, and the wedding garment bring."
3775,III.,“Come up higher!” cry the angels.--Let the bells in gladness ring.
3776,III.,
3777,III.,
3778,IV.,IV.
3779,IV.,
3780,IV.,Farewell! Farewell!
3781,IV.,"Like the chiming of the bells,"
3782,IV.,Which a tale of triumph tells;
3783,IV.,"As the news in tuneful notes,"
3784,IV.,"Leaping from the brazen throats,"
3785,IV.,On the startled ether floats;--
3786,IV.,"So in freedom, great and glorious,"
3787,IV.,"Over flesh and sense victorious,"
3788,IV.,Does the Spirit leap the barrier which across its pathway lies!
3789,IV.,"Greater far than royal Cæsar,"
3790,IV.,"Fearless as the northern Æsir,"
3791,IV.,"Drawn by Love’s celestial magnet, winged with faith and hope it flies,"
3792,IV.,"Upward o’er the starry pathway, leading onward through the skies,"
3793,IV.,"To the land of Light and Beauty, where no bud of promise dies."
3794,IV.,
3795,IV.,"There, through all the vast Empyrean,"
3796,IV.,"Wafted, as on gales Hesperian,"
3797,IV.,Comes the stirring cry of “Progress”! telling of the yet to be.
3798,IV.,"Tuneful as a seraph’s lyre,"
3799,IV.,“Come up higher! Come up higher!”
3800,IV.,Cry the hosts of holy angels; “learn the heavenly Masonry:
3801,IV.,"Life is one eternal progress: enter, then, the Third Degree;--"
3802,IV.,Ye who long for light and wisdom seek the Inner Mystery!
3803,IV.,
3804,IV.,"Thus, O Sons of Earth, I leave you!--leave you for that higher light;"
3805,IV.,"And my charge is now, Receive you all my parting words aright:"
3806,IV.,"Human passion, mad ambition, bound me to this lower Earth,"
3807,IV.,Even in my changed condition--even in my higher birth.
3808,IV.,"But, by earnest, firm endeavor, I have gained a height sublime;"
3809,IV.,"And I ne’er again--no, never!--shall be _bound_ to Space or Time;"
3810,IV.,I have conquered! and forever! Let the bells in triumph chime!
3811,IV.,“Come up higher!” cry the angels: “come up to the Royal Arch!
3812,IV.,"Come and join the Past Grand Masters, in the Soul’s progressive march,"
3813,IV.,"O, thou neophyte of Wisdom! Come up to the Royal Arch!”"
3814,IV.,
3815,IV.,"Sons of Earth! where’er ye dwell,"
3816,IV.,Break Temptation’s magic spell!
3817,IV.,"Truth is Heaven, and Falsehood, Hell!"
3818,IV.,Lawless Lust a demon fell!
3819,IV.,"Sons of Earth! where’er ye dwell,--"
3820,IV.,"In this Heaven, or in this Hell,--"
3821,IV.,When ye hear the solemn swell
3822,IV.,Of Creation’s mighty bell
3823,IV.,"Sounding forth Time’s funeral knell,"
3824,IV.,Ye shall meet me where I dwell;--
3825,IV.,Until then--FAREWELL! FAREWELL!
