132,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
133,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
134,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
135,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"""A true poet is one of the most precious gifts that can be bestowed on"
136,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"a generation."" He speaks for it and he speaks to it. Reflecting and"
137,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"interpreting his age and its thoughts, feelings, and purposes, he speaks"
138,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"for it; and with a love of truth, with a keener moral insight into the"
139,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"universal heart of man, and with the intuition of inspiration, he speaks"
140,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"to it, and through it to the world. It is thus"
141,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
142,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"""The poet to the whole wide world belongs,"
143,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Even as the Teacher is the child's."""
144,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
145,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"""Nor is it to the great masters alone that our homage and thankfulness"
146,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"are due. Wherever a true child of song strikes his harp, we love to"
147,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"listen. All that we ask is that the music be native, born of impassioned"
148,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"impulse that will not be denied, heartfelt, like the lark when she soars"
149,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,up to greet the morning and pours out her song by the same quivering
150,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"ecstasy that impels her flight."" For though the voices be many, the"
151,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"oracle is one, for ""God gave the poet his song."""
152,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
153,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Such was Henry Timrod, the Southern poet. A child of nature, his song"
154,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"is the voice of the Southland. Born in Charleston, S.C., December 8th,"
155,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"1829, his life cast in the seething torrent of civil war, his voice was"
156,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"also the voice of Carolina, and through her of the South, in all the"
157,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"rich glad life poured out in patriotic pride into that fatal struggle,"
158,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"in all the valor and endurance of that dark conflict, in all the gloom"
159,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"of its disaster, and in all the sacred tenderness that clings about its"
160,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"memories. He was the poet of the Lost Cause, the finest interpreter of"
161,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,the feelings and traditions of the splendid heroism of a brave people.
162,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Moreover, by his catholic spirit, his wide range, and world-wide"
163,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"sympathies, he is a true American poet."
164,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
165,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The purpose of the _TIMROD MEMORIAL ASSOCIATION_ of his native city and
166,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"State, in undertaking this new edition of his poems, is to erect a"
167,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"suitable public memorial to the poet, and also to let his own words"
168,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,renew and keep his own memory in his land's literature.
169,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
170,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
171,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The earliest edition of Timrod's poems was a small volume by Ticknor &
172,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Fields, of Boston, in 1860, just before the Civil War. This contained"
173,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"only the poems of the first eight or nine years previous, and was warmly"
174,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"welcomed North and South. The ""New York Tribune"" then greeted this small"
175,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"first volume in these words: ""These poems are worthy of a wide audience,"
176,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,and they form a welcome offering to the common literature of our
177,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"country."""
178,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
179,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"In this first volume was evinced the culture, the lively fancy, the"
180,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"delicate and vigorous imagination, and the finished artistic power"
181,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"of his mind, even then rejoicing in the fullness and freshness of its"
182,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,creations and in the unwearied flow of its natural music. But it fell
183,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"then on the great world of letters almost unheeded, shut out by the war"
184,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"cloud that soon broke upon the land, enveloping all in darkness."
185,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
186,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The edition of his complete poems was not issued until the South was
187,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"recovering from the ravage of war, and was entitled ""The Poems of Henry"
188,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Timrod, edited with a sketch of the Poet's life by Paul H. Hayne. E. J."
189,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Hale & Son, publishers, New York, 1873."" And immediately, in 1874, there"
190,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"followed a second edition of this volume, which contained the noble"
191,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,series of war poems and other lyrics written since the edition of 1860.
192,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"In 1884 an illustrated edition of ""Katie"" was published by Hale & Son,"
193,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,New York. All of these editions were long ago exhausted by an admiring
194,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,public.
195,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
196,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The present edition contains the poems of all the former editions, and"
197,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,also some earlier poems not heretofore published.
198,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
199,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
200,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The name of Timrod has been closely identified with the history of South
201,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Carolina for over a century. Before the Revolution, Henry Timrod, of"
202,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"German birth, the founder of the family in America, was a prominent"
203,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"citizen of Charleston, and the president of that historic association,"
204,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"the German Friendly Society, still existing, a century and a quarter"
205,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,old. We find his name first on the roll of the German Fusiliers of
206,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Charleston, volunteers formed in May, 1775, for the defense of the"
207,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"country, immediately on hearing of the battle of Lexington. Again in"
208,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"the succeeding generation, in the Seminole war and in the peril of"
209,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"St. Augustine, the German Fusiliers were commanded by his son, Captain"
210,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"William Henry Timrod, who was the father of the poet, and who himself"
211,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,published a volume of poems in the early part of the century. He was
212,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"the editor of a literary periodical published in Charleston, to which"
213,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,he himself largely contributed. He was of strong intellect and delicate
214,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"feelings, and an ardent patriot."
215,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
216,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Some of the more striking of the poems of the elder Timrod are the
217,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,following. Washington Irving said of these lines that Tom Moore had
218,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,written no finer lyric:--
219,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
220,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
221,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"To Time, the Old Traveler"
222,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
223,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
224,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"They slander thee, Old Traveler,"
225,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Who say that thy delight
226,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Is to scatter ruin, far and wide,"
227,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,In thy wantonness of might:
228,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,For not a leaf that falleth
229,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Before thy restless wings,"
230,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But in thy flight, thou changest it"
231,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,To a thousand brighter things.
232,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
233,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Thou passest o'er the battlefield
234,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Where the dead lie stiff and stark,"
235,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Where naught is heard save the vulture's scream,"
236,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And the gaunt wolf's famished bark;
237,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But thou hast caused the grain to spring
238,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"From the blood-enrichèd clay,"
239,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And the waving corn-tops seem to dance
240,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,To the rustic's merry lay.
241,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
242,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Thou hast strewed the lordly palace
243,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"In ruins on the ground,"
244,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And the dismal screech of the owl is heard
245,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Where the harp was wont to sound;
246,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But the selfsame spot thou coverest
247,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With the dwellings of the poor,"
248,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And a thousand happy hearts enjoy
249,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,What _ONE_ usurped before.
250,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
251,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,'T is true thy progress layeth
252,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Full many a loved one low,"
253,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And for the brave and beautiful
254,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Thou hast caused our tears to flow;

334,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","The poet's mother was the daughter of Mr. Charles Prince, a citizen"
335,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","of Charleston, whose parents had come from England just before the"
336,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","Revolution. Mr. Prince had married Miss French, daughter of an officer"
337,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","in the Revolution, whose family were from Switzerland. It was the"
338,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","influence of his mother also that helped to form the poet's character,"
339,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",and his intense and passionate love of nature. Her beautiful face and
340,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","form, her purity and goodness, her delight in all the sights and sounds"
341,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","of the country, her childish rapture in wood and field, her love of"
342,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","flowers and trees, and all the mystery and gladness of nature, are among"
343,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","the cherished memories of all her children, and vividly described by the"

346,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","William Henry Timrod, father of the poet, died of disease contracted"
347,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","in the Florida war, and his family thereafter were in straitened"
348,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","circumstances. Nevertheless, the early education of his gifted son was"
349,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","provided for. Paul H. Hayne, the poet, was one of his earliest friends"
350,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","and schoolmates at Charleston's best school. They sat together, and to"
351,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",his brother boy-poet he first showed his earliest verses in exulting
352,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","confidence. This friendship and confidence lasted through life, and"
353,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",Hayne has tenderly embalmed it in his sketch of the poet. We have this
354,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",faithful picture of him at that time:--
355,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",
356,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","""Modest and diffident, with a nervous utterance, but with melody ever in"
357,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","his heart and on his lip. Though always slow of speech, he was yet, like"
358,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","Burns, quick to learn. The chariot wheels might jar in the gate through"
359,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","which he tried to drive his winged steeds, but the horses were of"
360,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","celestial temper and the car purest gold."""
361,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",
362,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","His school-fellows remember him as silent and shy, full of quick"
363,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","impulse, and with an eager ambition, insatiable in his thirst for books,"

365,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","weekly holiday and its long rambles through wood and field. ""The sweet"
366,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","security of streets"" had no charm for him. He rejoiced in Nature and her"
367,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","changing scenes and seasons. She was always to him comfort, refreshment,"

378,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",His college life at the University of Georgia was interrupted by
379,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","sickness and cramped by lack of means, and his literary plans were"
380,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","foiled by necessity. Nevertheless, he left his Alma Mater with a mind"

385,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",Dr. J. Dickson Bruns has left this graphic description of Timrod's
386,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","personal appearance, and of some prominent traits of his social"
387,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",character:--
388,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",
389,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","""In stature,"" he says, ""Timrod was far below the medium height. He"
390,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","had always excelled in boyish sports, and, as he grew to manhood, his"
391,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",unusual breadth of shoulder still seemed to indicate a physical vigor
392,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","which the slender wrists, thin, transparent hands, and habitually lax"
393,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",attitude but too plainly contradicted.
394,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",
395,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","""The square jaw was almost stern in its strongly pronounced lines, the"
396,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","mouth large, the lips exquisitely sensitive, the gray eyes set deeply"
397,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","under massive brows, and full of a melancholy and pleading tenderness,"
398,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","which attracted attention to his face at once, as the face of one who"
399,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",had thought and suffered much.
400,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",
401,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","""His walk was quick and nervous, with an energy in it that betokened"
402,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","decision of character, but ill sustained by the stammering speech;"
403,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",for in society he was the shyest and most undemonstrative of men. To a
404,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","single friend whom he trusted, he would pour out his inmost heart; but"
405,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","let two or three be gathered together, above all, introduce a stranger,"
406,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","and he instantly became a quiet, unobtrusive listener, though never a"
407,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",moody or uncongenial one!
408,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",
409,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","""Among men of letters, he was always esteemed as a most sympathetic"
410,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","companion; timid, reserved, unready, if taken by surprise, but highly"
411,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","cultivated, and still more highly endowed."
412,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",
413,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","""The key to his social character was to be found in the feminine"
414,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","gentleness of his temperament. He shrank from noisy debate, and the"
415,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","wordy clash of argument, as from a blow. It stunned and bewildered him,"
416,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","and left him, in the mêlée, alike incapable of defense or attack. And"
417,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","yet, when some burly protagonist would thrust himself too rudely"
418,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","into the ring, and try to bear down opposition by sheer vehemence"
419,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","of declamation, from the corner where he sat ensconced in unregarded"
420,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","silence, _HE WOULD SUDDENLY SLING OUT SOME SHARP, SWIFT PEBBLE OF"
421,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","THOUGHT_, which he had been slowly rounding, and smite with an aim so"

430,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","Charleston to Timrod was home, and he always returned with kindling"

436,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",and his social hours were bright in their intercourse and in the cordial

442,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","Suited by endowment and prepared by special study for a professorship,"

444,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","was compelled to become a private teacher, an office the sacredness of"
445,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",which he profoundly realized. In his leisure hours he now gave himself
446,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","up to deeper study of nature, literature, and man. It was in these few"
447,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",years of quiet retreat that he wrote the poems contained in the first
448,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","edition of his works, 1859-60, which, laden with all the poet's longing"
449,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","to be heard, were little heeded in the first great shock of war. Indeed,"
450,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","in such a storm, what shelter could a poet find? An ardent Carolinian,"
451,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","devoted to his native State with an allegiance as to his country,"
452,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","he left his books and study, and threw himself into the struggle, a"
453,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",volunteer in the army. In the first years of the war he was in and
454,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","near Charleston, and wrote those memorable poems and martial lyrics:"
455,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","""Carolina"", ""A Cry to Arms"", ""Charleston"", ""Ripley"", ""Ethnogenesis"","
456,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","and ""The Cotton Boll"", which deeply stirred the heart of his State, and,"
457,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","indeed, of the whole South. His was the voice of his people. Under its"
458,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","spell the public response was quick, and promised largest honor and"
459,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",world-wide fame for the poet. The project formed by some of the most
460,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","eminent men of the State, late in 1862, was to publish an illustrated"
461,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",and highly embellished edition of his works in London. The war
462,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","correspondent of the ""London Illustrated News"", Vizitelly, himself an"
463,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","artist, promised original illustrations, and the future seemed bright"
464,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","for the gratification of his heart's desire, to be known and heard"
465,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",in the great literary centre of the English-speaking world. But
466,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",disappointment again was his lot. Amid the increasing stress of the
467,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","conflict, every public and private energy in the South was absorbed in"
468,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",maintaining the ever weakening struggle; and with all art and literature
469,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",and learning our poet's hopes were buried in the common grave of war;
470,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","not because he was not loved and cherished, and his genius appreciated,"
471,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","but because a terrible need was upon his people, and desperate issues"
472,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",were draining their life-blood. Then he went to the front. Too weak for
473,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",the field (for the fatal weakness that finally sapped his life was then
474,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","upon him), he was compelled, under medical direction, to retire from"
475,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","the battle ranks, and made a last desperate effort to serve the cause he"
476,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",loved as a war correspondent. In this capacity he joined the great army
477,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",of the West after the battle of Shiloh. The story of his camp life
478,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","was indeed pathetic. Dr. Bruns writes of him then: ""One can scarcely"
479,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",conceive of a situation more hopelessly wretched than that of a mere
480,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",child in the world's ways suddenly flung down into the heart of that
481,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","strong retreat, and tossed like a straw on the crest of those refluent"
482,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","waves from which he escaped as by a miracle."" Home he came, baffled,"
483,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","dispirited, and sore hurt, to receive the succor of generous friendship,"
484,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","and for a brief time a safe congenial refuge, in 1864, in an editor's"
485,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","chair of the ""South Carolinian"", at the capital of his native State."
486,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","Here his strong pen wrote the stirring editorials of that critical time,"
487,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","and there, tempted by the passing hour of comparative calm, he married"
488,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","Miss Kate Goodwin, ""Katie, the fair Saxon"" of his exquisite song. Here"
489,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","the war that had broken all his plans, and wrecked his health and hopes,"
490,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","and made literature for a time in the South a beggar's vocation, left"
491,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","him with wife and child, the ""darling Willie"" of his verse, dependent"
492,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",upon his already sapped and fast failing strength for support. Here he
493,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","saw the capital of his native State, marked for vengeance, pitilessly"
494,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",destroyed by fire and sword. Here gaunt ruin stalked and want entered
495,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","his own home, made desolate as all the hearthstones of his people."
496,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",Here the peace that ensued was the peace of the desert! Here the
497,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","army, defeated and broken, came back after the long heroic struggle to"
498,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","blackened chimneys, sole vestige of home, and the South, with not even"
499,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","bread for her famished children, still stood in solemn silence by those"
500,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",deeper furrows watered with blood. The suffering that he endured was the
501,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","common suffering of those around him,--actual physical want and lack of"
502,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","the commonest comforts of life, felt most keenly by his sensitive nature"
503,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","and delicate constitution. In the midst of this fierce stress, his"
504,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","darling boy, the crown of his life, died. All his affections, it seemed,"
505,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","were poured out at once, as water spilled upon the ground. He was dying"
506,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","of consumption, and earth shadows crowded around him."
507,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",
508,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","Though long in feeble health, his last illness was brief. The best"
509,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","physicians lovingly gave their skillful ministration, and the State's"
510,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","most eminent men, in their common need, tenderly cared for him and his."
511,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","With death before him, he clung passionately to his art, absorbed in"
512,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",that alone and in the great Beyond. His latest occupation was correcting
513,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","the proof-sheets of his own poems, and he passed away with them by his"
514,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","side, stained with his life-blood."
515,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",
516,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",In the autumn of 1867 he was laid by his beloved child in Trinity

518,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","great Carolinians bore him to the grave,--a grave that, through the"
519,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_","sackcloth of the Reconstruction period in South Carolina, remained"
520,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",without a stone. But as he himself wrote of the host of the Southern

527,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",
528,"_ENJOY, BUT NOT ABUSE!_",In later years loving friends reared a small memorial shaft to mark

1303,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,In blue above thee; though thy foes be hard
1304,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And cruel as their weapons, it shall guard"
1305,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Thy hearth-stones as a bulwark; make thee great
1306,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,In white and bloodless state;

1312,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of Cornwall, hollowed out beneath the bed"
1313,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of ocean, when a storm rolls overhead,"
1314,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Hear the dull booming of the world of brine
1315,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Above them, and a mighty muffled roar"
1316,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of winds and waters, yet toil calmly on,"
1317,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And split the rock, and pile the massive ore,"
1318,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Or carve a niche, or shape the archëd roof;"
1319,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"So I, as calmly, weave my woof"
1320,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of song, chanting the days to come,"
1321,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Unsilenced, though the quiet summer air"
1322,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Stirs with the bruit of battles, and each dawn"
1323,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Wakes from its starry silence to the hum
1324,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of many gathering armies.  Still,"
1325,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"In that we sometimes hear,"
1326,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Upon the Northern winds, the voice of woe"
1327,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Not wholly drowned in triumph, though I know"
1328,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The end must crown us, and a few brief years"
1329,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Dry all our tears,"
1330,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I may not sing too gladly.  To Thy will
1331,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Resigned, O Lord! we cannot all forget"
1332,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,That there is much even Victory must regret.

1338,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,From stain of patriot or of hostile blood!

1360,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Ah! how lovely she looked as she flung from her arms,"
1361,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,In heaps to this table (now starred with the stains
1362,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of her booty yet wet with those yesterday rains),"
1363,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"These roses and lilies, and--what? let me see!"
1364,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Then was off in a moment, but turned with a glee,"
1365,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"That lit her sweet face as with moonlight, to say,"
1366,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As 't was almost too late for a lesson to-day,"
1367,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"She meant to usurp, for this morning at least,"
1368,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,My office of Tutor; and instead of a feast
1369,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of such mouthfuls as 'poluphloisboio thalasses',"
1370,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With which I fed her, I should study the grasses"
1371,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"(Love-grasses she called them), the buds, and the flowers"
1372,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of which I know nothing; and if ""with MY powers"","
1373,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I did not learn all she could teach in that time,"

1375,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"If I did not do this, and she flung back her hair,"
1376,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And shook her bright head with a menacing air,"
1377,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,She'd be--oh! she'd be--a real Saracen Omar
1378,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,To a certain much-valued edition of Homer!
1379,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But these flowers! I believe I could number as soon
1380,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The shadowy thoughts of a last summer's noon,"
1381,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Or recall with their phases, each one after one,"
1382,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The clouds that came down to the death of the Sun,"
1383,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Cirrus, Stratus, or Nimbus, some evening last year,"
1384,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As unravel the web of one genus!  Why, there,"
1385,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As they lie by my desk in that glistering heap,"
1386,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,All tangled together like dreams in the sleep
1387,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of a bliss-fevered heart, I might turn them and turn"
1388,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Till night, in a puzzle of pleasure, and learn"
1389,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Not a fact, not a secret I prize half so much,"
1390,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As, how rough is this leaf when I think of her touch."
1391,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,There's one now blown yonder! what can be its name?
1392,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"A topaz wine-colored, the wine in a flame;"
1393,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And another that's hued like the pulp of a melon,"
1394,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But sprinkled all o'er as with seed-pearls of Ceylon;
1395,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And a third! its white petals just clouded with pink!
1396,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And a fourth, that blue star! and then this, too! I think"
1397,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"If one brought me this moment an amethyst cup,"
1398,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"From which, through a liquor of amber, looked up,"
1399,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With a glow as of eyes in their elfin-like lustre,"
1400,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Stones culled from all lands in a sunshiny cluster,"
1401,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,From the ruby that burns in the sands of Mysore

1407,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"(This one which she touched with her mouth, and let slip"
1408,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"From her fingers by chance, as her exquisite lip,"
1409,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With a music befitting the language divine,"
1410,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Gave the roll of the Greek's multitudinous line),"
1411,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I should take--not the gems--but enough! let me shut
1412,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"In the blossom that woke it, my folly, and put"
1413,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Both away in my bosom--there, in a heart-niche,"
1414,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,One shall outlive the other--is 't hard to tell which?
1415,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"In the name of all starry and beautiful things,"
1416,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"What is it? the cross in the centre, these rings,"
1417,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And the petals that shoot in an intricate maze,"
1418,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,From the disk which is lilac--or purple? like rays
1419,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,In a blue Aureole!
1420,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1421,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And so now will she wot,"
1422,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"When I sit by her side with my brows in a knot,"
1423,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And praise her so calmly, or chide her perhaps,"
1424,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"If her voice falter once in its musical lapse,"
1425,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As I've done, I confess, just to gaze at a flush"
1426,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"In the white of her throat, or to watch the quick rush"
1427,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of the tear she sheds smiling, as, drooping her curls"
1428,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"O'er that book I keep shrined like a casket of pearls,"
1429,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"She reads on in low tones of such tremulous sweetness,"
1430,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"That (in spite of some faults) I am forced, in discreetness,"
1431,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"To silence, lest mine, growing hoarse, should betray"
1432,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"What I must not reveal--will she guess now, I say,"
1433,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"How, for all his grave looks, the stern, passionless Tutor,"
1434,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With more than the love of her youthfulest suitor,"
1435,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Is hiding somewhere in the shroud of his vest,"
1436,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"By a heart that is beating wild wings in its nest,"
1437,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"This flower, thrown aside in the sport of a minute,"
1438,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And which he holds dear as though folded within it
1439,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Lay the germ of the bliss that he dreams of!  Ah, me!"
1440,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"It is hard to love thus, yet to seem and to be"
1441,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"A thing for indifference, faint praise, or cold blame,"
1442,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"When you long (by the right of deep passion, the claim,"
1443,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"On the loved of the loving, at least to be heard)"
1444,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"To take the white hand, and with glance, touch, and word,"
1445,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Burn your way to the heart!  That her step on the stair?
1446,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Be still thou fond flutterer!
1447,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1448,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,How little I care
1449,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"For your favorites, see! they are all of them, look!"

1456,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1457,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1458,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1459,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Not to win thy favor, maiden, not to steal away thy heart,"
1460,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Have I ever sought thy presence, ever stooped to any art;"
1461,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Thou wast but a wildering problem, which I aimed to solve, and then"
1462,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Make it matter for my note-book, or a picture for my pen."
1463,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"So, I daily conned thee over, thinking it no dangerous task,"
1464,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Peeping underneath thy lashes, peering underneath thy mask--"
1465,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,For thou wear'st one--no denial! there is much within thine eyes;
1466,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But those stars have other secrets than are patent in their skies.
1467,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And I read thee, read thee closely, every grace and every sin,"
1468,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Looked behind the outward seeming to the strange wild world within,"
1469,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Where thy future self is forming, where I saw--no matter what!"
1470,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"There was something less than angel, there was many an earthly spot;"
1471,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Yet so beautiful thy errors that I had no heart for blame,"
1472,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And thy virtues made thee dearer than my dearest hopes of fame;
1473,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"All so blended, that in wishing one peculiar trait removed,"
1474,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"We indeed might make thee better, but less lovely and less loved."
1475,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,All my mind was in the study--so two thrilling fortnights passed--
1476,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,All my mind was in the study--till my heart was touched at last.
1477,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Well! and then the book was finished, the absorbing task was done,"
1478,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I awoke as one who had been dreaming in a noon-day sun;
1479,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With a fever on my forehead, and a throbbing in my brain,"
1480,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"In my soul delirious wishes, in my heart a lasting pain;"
1481,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Yet so hopeless, yet so cureless--as in every great despair--"
1482,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I was very calm and silent, and I never stooped to prayer,"
1483,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Like a sick man unattended, reckless of the coming death,"
1484,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Only for he knows it certain, and he feels no sister's breath."
1485,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"All the while as by an Até, with no pity in her face,"
1486,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Yet with eyes of witching beauty, and with form of matchless grace,"
1487,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I was haunted by thy presence, oh! for weary nights and days,"
1488,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I was haunted by thy spirit, I was troubled by thy gaze,"
1489,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And the question which to answer I had taxed a subtle brain,"
1490,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"What thou art, and what thou wilt be, came again and yet again;"
1491,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With its opposite deductions, it recurred a thousand times,"
1492,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Like a coward's apprehensions, like a madman's favorite rhymes."
1493,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But to-night my thoughts flow calmer--in thy room I think I stand,"
1494,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"See a fair white page before thee, and a pen within thy hand;"
1495,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And thy fingers sweep the paper, and a light is in thine eyes,"
1496,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Whilst I read thy secret fancies, whilst I hear thy secret sighs."
1497,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"What they are I will not whisper, those are lovely, these are deep,"
1498,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But one name is left unwritten, that is only breathed in sleep."
1499,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Is it wonder that my passion bursts at once from out its nest?
1500,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I have bent my knee before thee, and my love is all confessed;"
1501,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Though I knew that name unwritten was another name than mine,"
1502,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Though I felt those sighs half murmured what I could but half divine.
1503,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Aye! I hear thy haughty answer!  Aye! I see thy proud lip curl!
1504,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"""What presumption, and what folly!"" why, I only love a girl"
1505,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With some very winning graces, with some very noble traits,"
1506,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But no better than a thousand who have bent to humbler fates.
1507,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"That I ask not; I have, maiden, just as haught a soul as thine;"
1508,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"If thou think'st thy place above me, thou shalt never stoop to mine."
1509,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Yet as long as blood runs redly, yet as long as mental worth"
1510,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Is a nobler gift than fortune, is a holier thing than birth,"
1511,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I will claim the right to utter, to the high and to the low,"
1512,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"That I love them, or I hate them, that I am a friend or foe."
1513,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Nor shall any slight unman me; I have yet some little strength,"
1514,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Yet my song shall sound as sweetly, yet a power be mine at length!"
1515,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Then, oh, then! but moans are idle--hear me, pitying saints above!"
1516,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With a chaplet on my forehead, I will justify my love."
1517,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And perhaps when thou art leaning on some less devoted breast,"
1518,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Thou shalt murmur, ""He was worthier than my blinded spirit guessed."""

1526,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1527,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I saw her, Harry, first, in March--"
1528,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,You know the street that leadeth down
1529,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,By the old bridge's crumbling arch?--
1530,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Just where it leaves the dusty town
1531,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1532,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A lonely house stands grim and dark--
1533,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,You've seen it? then I need not say
1534,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,How quaint the place is--did you mark
1535,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"An ivied window?  Well! one day,"
1536,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1537,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I, chasing some forgotten dream,"
1538,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And in a poet's idlest mood,"
1539,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Caught, as I passed, a white hand's gleam--"
1540,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A shutter opened--there she stood
1541,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1542,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Training the ivy to its prop.
1543,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Two dark eyes and a brow of snow
1544,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Flashed down upon me--did I stop?--
1545,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,She says I did--I do not know.
1546,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1547,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But all that day did something glow
1548,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Just where the heart beats; frail and slight,"
1549,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"A germ had slipped its shell, and now"
1550,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Was pushing softly for the light.
1551,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1552,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And April saw me at her feet,"
1553,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Dear month of sunshine and of rain!
1554,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"My very fears were sometimes sweet,"
1555,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And hope was often touched with pain.
1556,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1557,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"For she was frank, and she was coy,"
1558,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A willful April in her ways;
1559,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And in a dream of doubtful joy
1560,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I passed some truly April days.
1561,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1562,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"May came, and on that arch, sweet mouth,"
1563,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The smile was graver in its play,"
1564,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And, softening with the softening South,"
1565,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,My April melted into May.
1566,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1567,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"She loved me, yet my heart would doubt,"
1568,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And ere I spoke the month was June--
1569,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,One warm still night we wandered out
1570,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,To watch a slowly setting moon.
1571,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1572,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Something which I saw not--my eyes
1573,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Were not on heaven--a star, perchance,"
1574,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Or some bright drapery of the skies,"
1575,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Had caught her earnest, upper glance."
1576,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1577,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And as she paused--Hal! we have played
1578,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Upon the very spot--a fir
1579,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Just touched me with its dreamy shade,"
1580,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But the full moonlight fell on her--
1581,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1582,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And as she paused--I know not why--
1583,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I longed to speak, yet could not speak;"
1584,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The bashful are the boldest--I--
1585,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I stooped and gently kissed her cheek.
1586,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1587,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A murmur (else some fragrant air
1588,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Stirred softly) and the faintest start--
1589,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,O Hal! we were the happiest pair!
1590,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,O Hal! I clasped her heart to heart!
1591,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1592,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And kissed away some tears that gushed;
1593,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But how she trembled, timid dove,"
1594,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"When my soul broke its silence, flushed"
1595,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,With a whole burning June of love.
1596,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1597,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Since then a happy year hath sped
1598,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Through months that seemed all June and May,"
1599,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And soon a March sun, overhead,"
1600,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Will usher in the crowning day.
1601,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1602,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Twelve blessed moons that seemed to glow
1603,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"All summer, Hal!--my peerless Kate!"
1604,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"She is the dearest--""Angel?""--no!"
1605,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Thank God!--but you shall see her--wait.
1606,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1607,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,So all is told!  I count on thee
1608,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"To see the Priest, Hal!  Pass the wine!"
1609,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Here's to my darling wife to be!
1610,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And here's to--when thou find'st her--thine!

1625,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And then return to tell me all
1626,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The silken secrets of the room.
1627,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1628,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Ah, dearest! may the elves that sway"
1629,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Thy fancies come from emerald plots,"
1630,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Where they have dozed and dreamed all day
1631,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,In hearts of blue forget-me-nots.
1632,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And one perhaps shall whisper thus:
1633,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Awake! and light the darkness, Sweet!"
1634,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"While thou art reveling with us,"
1635,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,He watches in the lonely street.
1636,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1637,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1638,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1639,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,

1643,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1644,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Another year! a short one, if it flow"
1645,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Like that just past,"
1646,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And I shall stand--if years can make me so--
1647,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A man at last.
1648,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1649,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Yet, while the hours permit me, I would pause"
1650,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And contemplate
1651,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The lot whereto unalterable laws
1652,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Have bound my fate.
1653,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1654,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Yet, from the starry regions of my youth,"
1655,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The empyreal height
1656,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Where dreams are happiness, and feeling truth,"
1657,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And life delight--
1658,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1659,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,From that ethereal and serene abode
1660,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,My soul would gaze
1661,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Downward upon the wide and winding road,"
1662,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Where manhood plays;
1663,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1664,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Plays with the baubles and the gauds of earth--
1665,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Wealth, power, and fame--"
1666,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Nor knows that in the twelvemonth after birth
1667,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,He did the same.
1668,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1669,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Where the descent begins, through long defiles"
1670,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I see them wind;
1671,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And some are looking down with hopeful smiles,"
1672,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And some are--blind.
1673,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1674,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And farther on a gay and glorious green
1675,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Dazzles the sight,"
1676,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"While noble forms are moving o'er the scene,"
1677,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Like things of light.
1678,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1679,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Towers, temples, domes of perfect symmetry"
1680,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Rise broad and high,"
1681,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With pinnacles among the clouds; ah, me!"
1682,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,None touch the sky.
1683,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1684,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,None pierce the pure and lofty atmosphere
1685,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Which I breathe now,"
1686,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And the strong spirits that inhabit there,"
1687,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Live--God sees how.
1688,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1689,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Sick of the very treasure which they heap;
1690,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Their tearless eyes
1691,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Sealed ever in a heaven-forgetting sleep,"
1692,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Whose dreams are lies;
1693,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1694,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And so, a motley, unattractive throng,"
1695,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"They toil and plod,"
1696,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Dead to the holy ecstasies of song,"
1697,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"To love, and God."
1698,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1699,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Dear God! if that I may not keep through life
1700,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"My trust, my truth,"
1701,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And that I must, in yonder endless strife,"
1702,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Lose faith with youth;
1703,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1704,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,If the same toil which indurates the hand
1705,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Must steel the heart,"
1706,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Till, in the wonders of the ideal land,"

1708,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1709,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Oh! take me hence! I would no longer stay
1710,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Beneath the sky;
1711,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Give me to chant one pure and deathless lay,"
1712,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And let me die!

1714,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1715,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1716,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1717,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Hark to the Shouting Wind
1718,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1719,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1720,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1721,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Hark to the shouting Wind!
1722,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Hark to the flying Rain!
1723,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And I care not though I never see
1724,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A bright blue sky again.
1725,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1726,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,There are thoughts in my breast to-day
1727,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,That are not for human speech;
1728,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But I hear them in the driving storm,"
1729,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And the roar upon the beach.
1730,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1731,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And oh, to be with that ship"
1732,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,That I watch through the blinding brine!
1733,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,O Wind! for thy sweep of land and sea!
1734,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,O Sea! for a voice like thine!
1735,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1736,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Shout on, thou pitiless Wind,"
1737,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,To the frightened and flying Rain!
1738,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I care not though I never see
1739,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A calm blue sky again.

1751,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And the moveless sea beneath.
1752,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1753,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Come down in thy strength on the deep!
1754,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Worse dangers there are in life,"
1755,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"When the waves are still, and the skies look fair,"
1756,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Than in their wildest strife.
1757,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1758,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"A friend I knew, whose days"
1759,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Were as calm as this sky overhead;
1760,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But one blue morn that was fairest of all,"
1761,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The heart in his bosom fell dead.
1762,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1763,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And they thought him alive while he walked
1764,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The streets that he walked in youth--
1765,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Ah! little they guessed the seeming man
1766,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Was a soulless corpse in sooth.
1767,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1768,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Come down in thy strength, O Storm!"
1769,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And lash the deep till it raves!
1770,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I am sick to the soul of that quiet sea,"

1783,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Listen thou to mine.
1784,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1785,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Two I choose to know the secret--
1786,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Thee, and yonder wordless flute;"
1787,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Dragons watch me, tender Lily,"
1788,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And thou must be mute.
1789,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1790,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"There's a maiden, and her name is..."
1791,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Hist! was that a rose-leaf fell?
1792,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"See, the rose is listening, Lily,"
1793,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And the rose may tell.
1794,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1795,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Lily-browed and lily-hearted,"
1796,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,She is very dear to me;
1797,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Lovely? yes, if being lovely"
1798,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Is--resembling thee.
1799,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1800,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Six to half a score of summers
1801,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Make the sweetest of the ""teens""--"
1802,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Not too young to guess, dear Lily,"
1803,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,What a lover means.
1804,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1805,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Laughing girl, and thoughtful woman,"
1806,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I am puzzled how to woo--
1807,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Shall I praise, or pique her, Lily?"
1808,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Tell me what to do.
1809,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1810,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"""Silly lover, if thy Lily"
1811,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Like her sister lilies be,"
1812,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Thou must woo, if thou wouldst wear her,"

1814,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1815,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"""Love's the lover's only magic,"

1824,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1825,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"""As thou talkest at the fireside,"
1826,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,With the little children by--

1829,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,

1852,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,'T will clasp the isle that holdeth thee.
1853,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1854,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I dip my hand within the wave;

1856,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I touch it with my lip, and lave"
1857,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,My forehead in the gold.
1858,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"It is a trivial thought, but sweet,"
1859,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Perhaps the wave will kiss thy feet.
1860,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1861,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Alas! I leave no trace behind--
1862,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,As little on the senseless stream
1863,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As on thy heart, or on thy mind;"
1864,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Which was the simpler dream,"
1865,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"To win that warm, wild love of thine,"
1866,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Or make the water whisper mine?
1867,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1868,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Dear stream! some moons must wax and wane
1869,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Ere I again shall cross thy tide,"
1870,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And then, perhaps, a viewless chain"

1885,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,To a dreamy and musical rhythm keeps time.
1886,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"A simple, but still a most magical strain,"
1887,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Its dim monotones have bewildered my brain
1888,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With a specious and cunning appearance of thought,"
1889,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I seem to be catching but never have caught.
1890,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1891,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I know it embodies some very sweet things,"

1894,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,It has died on my ear at the touch of my pen.
1895,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And so it keeps courting and shunning my quest,"

1917,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I've gazed in those bewildering eyes,"
1918,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Yet never owned their touching power,"
1919,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But when thou couldst not hear my sighs;
1920,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,It has not been that love has slept
1921,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"One single moment in my soul,"
1922,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Or that on lip or look I kept
1923,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A stern and stoical control;
1924,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But that I saw, but that I felt,"

1929,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"THAT hidden, hopeless love confessed,"
1930,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The fatal words would lose me, too,"
1931,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Even the weak friendship I possessed.
1932,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And so, I masked my secret well;"
1933,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The very love within my breast
1934,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Became the strange, but potent spell"
1935,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,By which I forced it into rest.
1936,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Yet there were times--I scarce know how
1937,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"These eager lips refrained to speak,--"
1938,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Some kindly smile would light thy brow,"

1944,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I might have changed the smile it wore,"
1945,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"To what perhaps it weareth now,"
1946,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And spite of all I feared to meet,"
1947,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Confessed that passion at thy feet.
1948,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"To save my heart, to spare thine own,"
1949,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,There was one remedy alone.
1950,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I fled, I shunned thy very touch,--"
1951,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"It cost me much, O God! how much!"
1952,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But if some burning tears were shed,"
1953,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Lady! I let them freely flow;
1954,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"At least, they left unbreathed, unsaid,"
1955,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A worse and wilder woe.
1956,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1957,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But now,--NOW that we part indeed,"
1958,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And that I may not think as then,"
1959,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"That as I wish, or as I need,"
1960,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I may return again,--"
1961,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Now that for months, perhaps for years--"
1962,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I see no limit in my fears--
1963,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"My home shall be some distant spot,"
1964,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Where thou--where even thy name is not,"
1965,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And since I shall not see the frown,"
1966,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Such wild, mad language must bring down,"
1967,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Could I--albeit I may not sue
1968,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,In hope to bend thy steadfast will--
1969,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Could I have breathed this word, adieu,"
1970,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And kept my secret still?
1971,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
1972,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Doubtless thou know'st the Hebrew story--

1978,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,How often too they must have knelt
1979,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,As equals to the same kind God;
1980,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And still the mortal never guessed,"
1981,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"How much and deeply he was blessed,"
1982,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Till when--the Angel's mission done--
1983,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The spell which drew him earthwards, riven--"
1984,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The lover saved--the maiden won--
1985,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,He plumed again his wings for Heaven;
1986,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,O Madeline! as unaware
1987,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Thou hast been followed everywhere,"
1988,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And girt and guarded by a love,"
1989,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As warm, as tender in its care,"
1990,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As pure, ay, powerful in prayer,"
1991,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,As any saint above!
1992,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Like the bright inmate of the skies,"
1993,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"It only looked with friendly eyes,"
1994,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And still had worn the illusive guise,"
1995,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And thus at least been half concealed;
1996,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But at this parting, painful hour,"
1997,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"It spreads its wings, unfolds its power,"
1998,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And stands, like Raphael, revealed."
1999,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2000,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"More, Lady! I would wish to speak,--"
2001,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But it were vain, and words are weak,"

2007,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I read in that unmelted eye;
2008,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Yet one dear favor, let me pray!"
2009,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Days, months, however slow to me,"
2010,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Must drag at last their length away,"
2011,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And I return--if not to thee--
2012,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,At least to breathe the same sweet air
2013,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,That wooes thy lips and waves thy hair.
2014,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Oh, then!--these daring lines forgot--"
2015,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Look, speak, as thou hadst read them not."
2016,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"So, Lady, may I still retain"
2017,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"A right I would not lose again,"
2018,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"For all that gold or guilt can buy,"
2019,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Or all that Heaven itself deny,"
2020,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"A right such love may justly claim,"
2021,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Of seeing thee in friendship's name.
2022,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Give me but this, and still at whiles,"
2023,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"A portion of thy faintest smiles,"
2024,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,It were enough to bless;
2025,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I may not, dare not ask for more"
2026,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Than boon so rich, and yet so poor,"
2027,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But I should die with less.

2037,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2038,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Fair Saxon, in my lover's creed,"
2039,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"My love were smaller than your meed,"
2040,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And you might justly deem it slight,"
2041,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As wanting truth as well as sight,"
2042,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"If, in that image which is shrined"
2043,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Where thoughts are sacred, you could find"
2044,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"A single charm, or more or less,"
2045,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Than you to all kind eyes possess.
2046,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"To me, even in the happiest dreams,"
2047,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Where, flushed with love's just dawning gleams,"
2048,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"My hopes their radiant wings unfurl,"
2049,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"You're but a simple English girl,"
2050,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"No fairer, grace for grace arrayed,"
2051,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Than many a simple Southern maid;
2052,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,With faults enough to make the good
2053,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Seem sweeter far than else it would;
2054,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Frank in your anger and your glee,"
2055,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And true as English natures be,"
2056,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Yet not without some maiden art
2057,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Which hides a loving English heart.
2058,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Still there are moments, brief and bright,"
2059,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"When fancy, by a poet's light,"
2060,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Beholds you clothed with loftier charms
2061,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Than love e'er gave to mortal arms.
2062,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A spell is woven on the air
2063,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"From your brown eyes and golden hair,"
2064,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And all at once you seem to stand
2065,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Before me as your native land,"
2066,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With all her greatness in your guise,"
2067,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And all her glory in your eyes;
2068,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And sometimes, as if angels sung,"
2069,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I hear her poets on your tongue.
2070,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And, therefore, I, who from a boy"
2071,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Have felt an almost English joy
2072,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"In England's undecaying might,"
2073,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And England's love of truth and right,"
2074,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Next to my own young country's fame
2075,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Holding her honor and her name,"
2076,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I--who, though born where not a vale"
2077,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Hath ever nursed a nightingale,"
2078,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Have fed my muse with English song
2079,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Until her feeble wing grew strong--
2080,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Feel, while with all the reverence meet"
2081,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I lay this volume at your feet,"
2082,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As if through your dear self I pay,"
2083,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"For many a deep and deathless lay,"
2084,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"For noble lessons nobly taught,"
2085,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"For tears, for laughter, and for thought,"
2086,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A portion of the mighty debt
2087,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,We owe to Shakespeare's England yet!

2095,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2096,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"It may be through some foreign grace,"
2097,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And unfamiliar charm of face;
2098,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,It may be that across the foam
2099,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Which bore her from her childhood's home,"
2100,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"By some strange spell, my Katie brought,"
2101,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Along with English creeds and thought--
2102,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Entangled in her golden hair--
2103,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Some English sunshine, warmth, and air!"
2104,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I cannot tell--but here to-day,"
2105,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A thousand billowy leagues away
2106,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,From that green isle whose twilight skies
2107,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"No darker are than Katie's eyes,"
2108,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"She seems to me, go where she will,"
2109,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,An English girl in England still!
2110,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2111,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I meet her on the dusty street,"
2112,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And daisies spring about her feet;
2113,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Or, touched to life beneath her tread,"
2114,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,An English cowslip lifts its head;
2115,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And, as to do her grace, rise up"
2116,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The primrose and the buttercup!
2117,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I roam with her through fields of cane,"
2118,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And seem to stroll an English lane,"
2119,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Which, white with blossoms of the May,"
2120,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Spreads its green carpet in her way!
2121,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As fancy wills, the path beneath"
2122,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Is golden gorse, or purple heath:"
2123,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And now we hear in woodlands dim
2124,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Their unarticulated hymn,"
2125,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Now walk through rippling waves of wheat,"
2126,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Now sink in mats of clover sweet,"
2127,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Or see before us from the lawn
2128,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The lark go up to greet the dawn!
2129,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,All birds that love the English sky
2130,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Throng round my path when she is by:
2131,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The blackbird from a neighboring thorn
2132,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With music brims the cup of morn,"
2133,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And in a thick, melodious rain"
2134,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The mavis pours her mellow strain!
2135,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But only when my Katie's voice
2136,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Makes all the listening woods rejoice
2137,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I hear--with cheeks that flush and pale--
2138,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The passion of the nightingale!
2139,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2140,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Anon the pictures round her change,"
2141,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And through an ancient town we range,"
2142,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Whereto the shadowy memory clings
2143,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of one of England's Saxon kings,"
2144,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And which to shrine his fading fame
2145,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Still keeps his ashes and his name.
2146,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Quaint houses rise on either hand,"
2147,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But still the airs are fresh and bland,"
2148,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,As if their gentle wings caressed
2149,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Some new-born village of the West.
2150,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A moment by the Norman tower
2151,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,We pause; it is the Sabbath hour!
2152,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And o'er the city sinks and swells
2153,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The chime of old St. Mary's bells,"
2154,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Which still resound in Katie's ears
2155,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,As sweet as when in distant years
2156,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,She heard them peal with jocund din
2157,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A merry English Christmas in!
2158,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"We pass the abbey's ruined arch,"
2159,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And statelier grows my Katie's march,"
2160,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"As round her, wearied with the taint"
2161,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Of Transatlantic pine and paint,"
2162,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,She sees a thousand tokens cast
2163,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Of England's venerable Past!
2164,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Our reverent footsteps lastly claims
2165,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The younger chapel of St. James,"
2166,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Which, though, as English records run,"
2167,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Not old, had seen full many a sun,"
2168,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Ere to the cold December gale
2169,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The thoughtful Pilgrim spread his sail.
2170,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,There Katie in her childish days
2171,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Spelt out her prayers and lisped her praise,"
2172,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And doubtless, as her beauty grew,"
2173,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Did much as other maidens do--
2174,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Across the pews and down the aisle
2175,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Sent many a beau-bewildering smile,"
2176,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And to subserve her spirit's need
2177,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Learned other things beside the creed!
2178,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"There, too, to-day her knee she bows,"
2179,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And by her one whose darker brows
2180,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Betray the Southern heart that burns
2181,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Beside her, and which only turns"
2182,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Its thoughts to Heaven in one request,"
2183,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Not all unworthy to be blest,"
2184,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But rising from an earthlier pain
2185,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Than might beseem a Christian fane.
2186,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Ah! can the guileless maiden share
2187,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The wish that lifts that passionate prayer?
2188,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Is all at peace that breast within?
2189,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Good angels! warn her of the sin!
2190,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Alas! what boots it? who can save
2191,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A willing victim of the wave?
2192,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Who cleanse a soul that loves its guilt?
2193,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Or gather wine when wine is spilt?
2194,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2195,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,We quit the holy house and gain
2196,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The open air; then, happy twain,"
2197,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Adown familiar streets we go,"
2198,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And now and then she turns to show,"
2199,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"With fears that all is changing fast,"
2200,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Some spot that's sacred to her Past.
2201,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Here by this way, through shadows cool,"
2202,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"A little maid, she tripped to school;"
2203,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And there each morning used to stop
2204,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Before a wonder of a shop
2205,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Where, built of apples and of pears,"
2206,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Rose pyramids of golden spheres;
2207,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"While, dangling in her dazzled sight,"
2208,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Ripe cherries cast a crimson light,"
2209,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And made her think of elfin lamps,"
2210,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And feast and sport in fairy camps,"
2211,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Whereat, upon her royal throne"
2212,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"(Most richly carved in cherry-stone),"
2213,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Titania ruled, in queenly state,"
2214,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,The boisterous revels of the fête!
2215,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"'T was yonder, with their ""horrid"" noise,"
2216,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Dismissed from books, she met the boys,"
2217,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Who, with a barbarous scorn of girls,"
2218,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Glanced slightly at her sunny curls,"
2219,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And laughed and leaped as reckless by
2220,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,As though no pretty face were nigh!
2221,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,But--here the maiden grows demure--
2222,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Indeed she's not so VERY sure,"
2223,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"That in a year, or haply twain,"
2224,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Who looked e'er failed to look again,"
2225,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And sooth to say, I little doubt"
2226,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"(Some azure day, the truth will out!)"
2227,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,That certain baits in certain eyes
2228,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Caught many an unsuspecting prize;
2229,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And somewhere underneath these eaves
2230,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,A budding flirt put forth its leaves!
2231,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2232,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Has not the sky a deeper blue,"
2233,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Have not the trees a greener hue,"
2234,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And bend they not with lordlier grace
2235,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And nobler shapes above the place
2236,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Where on one cloudless winter morn
2237,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,My Katie to this life was born?
2238,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Ah, folly! long hath fled the hour"
2239,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"When love to sight gave keener power,"
2240,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And lovers looked for special boons
2241,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,In brighter flowers and larger moons.
2242,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But wave the foliage as it may,"
2243,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And let the sky be ashen gray,"
2244,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Thus much at least a manly youth
2245,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,May hold--and yet not blush--as truth:
2246,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,If near that blessed spot of earth
2247,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Which saw the cherished maiden's birth
2248,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"No softer dews than usual rise,"
2249,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And life there keeps its wonted guise,"
2250,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Yet not the less that spot may seem
2251,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,As lovely as a poet's dream;
2252,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And should a fervid faith incline
2253,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"To make thereof a sainted shrine,"
2254,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Who may deny that round us throng
2255,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"A hundred earthly creeds as wrong,"
2256,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"But meaner far, which yet unblamed"
2257,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Stalk by us and are not ashamed?
2258,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"So, therefore, Katie, as our stroll"
2259,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Ends at this portal, while you roll"
2260,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Those lustrous eyes to catch each ray
2261,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"That may recall some vanished day,"
2262,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I--let them jeer and laugh who will--
2263,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Stoop down and kiss the sacred sill!
2264,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2265,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,So strongly sometimes on the sense
2266,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"These fancies hold their influence,"
2267,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,That in long well-known streets I stray
2268,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Like one who fears to lose his way.
2269,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The stranger, I, the native, she,"
2270,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Myself, not Kate, had crossed the sea;"
2271,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And changing place, and mixing times,"
2272,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I walk in unfamiliar climes!
2273,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"These houses, free to every breeze"
2274,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"That blows from warm Floridian seas,"
2275,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Assume a massive English air,"
2276,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And close around an English square;
2277,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"While, if I issue from the town,"
2278,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"An English hill looks greenly down,"
2279,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Or round me rolls an English park,"
2280,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And in the Broad I hear the Larke!
2281,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Thus when, where woodland violets hide,"
2282,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"I rove with Katie at my side,"
2283,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,It scarce would seem amiss to say:
2284,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"""Katie! my home lies far away,"
2285,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Beyond the pathless waste of brine,"
2286,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,In a young land of palm and pine!
2287,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"There, by the tropic heats, the soul"
2288,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Is touched as if with living coal,"
2289,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,And glows with such a fire as none
2290,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Can feel beneath a Northern sun,"
2291,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Unless--my Katie's heart attest!--
2292,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,'T is kindled in an English breast!
2293,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Such is the land in which I live,"
2294,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And, Katie! such the soul I give."
2295,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Come! ere another morning beam,"
2296,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,We'll cleave the sea with wings of steam;
2297,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And soon, despite of storm or calm,"
2298,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Beneath my native groves of palm,"
2299,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"Kind friends shall greet, with joy and pride,"
2300,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"The Southron and his English bride!"""

2311,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"What will you say, when I tell you here,"
2312,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"That already, I think, for a little praise,"
2313,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,I have paid too dear?
2314,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2315,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"For, I know not why, when I tell my thought,"
2316,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,It seems as though I fling it away;
2317,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"And the charm wherewith a fancy is fraught,"
2318,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,"When secret, dies with the fleeting lay"
2319,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,Into which it is wrought.
2320,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2321,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,So my butterfly-dreams their golden wings

2331,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2332,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2333,POEMS OF HENRY TIMROD,
2334,I,I
2335,I,
2336,I,"You say, as one who shapes a life,"
2337,I,"That you will never be a wife,"
2338,I,
2339,I,"And, laughing lightly, ask my aid"
2340,I,To paint your future as a maid.
2341,I,
2342,I,This is the portrait; and I take
2343,I,The softest colors for your sake:
2344,I,
2345,I,"The springtime of your soul is dead,"
2346,I,And forty years have bent your head;
2347,I,
2348,I,"The lines are firmer round your mouth,"
2349,I,But still its smile is like the South.
2350,I,
2351,I,"Your eyes, grown deeper, are not sad,"
2352,I,Yet never more than gravely glad;
2353,I,
2354,I,And the old charm still lurks within
2355,I,The cloven dimple of your chin.
2356,I,
2357,I,"Some share, perhaps, of youthful gloss"
2358,I,Your cheek hath shed; but still across
2359,I,
2360,I,The delicate ear are folded down
2361,I,Those silken locks of chestnut brown;
2362,I,
2363,I,Though here and there a thread of gray
2364,I,Steals through them like a lunar ray.
2365,I,
2366,I,One might suppose your life had passed
2367,I,Unvexed by any troubling blast;
2368,I,
2369,I,And such--for all that I foreknow--
2370,I,May be the truth!  The deeper woe!
2371,I,
2372,I,A loveless heart is seldom stirred;
2373,I,And sorrow shuns the mateless bird;
2374,I,
2375,I,But ah! through cares alone we reach
2376,I,The happiness which mocketh speech;
2377,I,
2378,I,In the white courts beyond the stars
2379,I,The noblest brow is seamed with scars;
2380,I,
2381,I,And they on earth who've wept the most
2382,I,Sit highest of the heavenly host.
2383,I,
2384,I,Grant that your maiden life hath sped
2385,I,"In music o'er a golden bed,"
2386,I,
2387,I,"With rocks, and winds, and storms at truce,"
2388,I,And not without a noble use;
2389,I,
2390,I,Yet are you happy?  In your air
2391,I,"I see a nameless want appear,"
2392,I,
2393,I,And a faint shadow on your cheek
2394,I,Tells what the lips refuse to speak.
2395,I,
2396,I,You have had all a maid could hope
2397,I,In the most cloudless horoscope:
2398,I,
2399,I,The strength that cometh from above;
2400,I,A Christian mother's holy love;
2401,I,
2402,I,And always at your soul's demand
2403,I,"A brother's, sister's heart and hand."
2404,I,
2405,I,Small need your heart hath had to roam
2406,I,Beyond the circle of your home;
2407,I,
2408,I,And yet upon your wish attends
2409,I,A loving throng of genial friends.
2410,I,
2411,I,"What, in a lot so sweet as this,"
2412,I,Is wanting to complete your bliss?
2413,I,
2414,I,And to what secret shall I trace
2415,I,"The clouds that sometimes cross your face,"
2416,I,
2417,I,And that sad look which now and then
2418,I,"Comes, disappears, and comes again,"
2419,I,
2420,I,And dies reluctantly away
2421,I,In those clear eyes of azure gray?
2422,I,
2423,I,"At best, and after all, the place"
2424,I,"You fill with such a serious grace,"
2425,I,
2426,I,"Hath much to try a woman's heart,"
2427,I,And you but play a painful part.
2428,I,
2429,I,"The world around, with little ruth,"
2430,I,"Still laughs at maids who have not youth,"
2431,I,
2432,I,"And, right or wrong, the old maid rests"
2433,I,"The victim of its paltry jests,"
2434,I,
2435,I,And still is doomed to meet and bear
2436,I,Its pitying smile or furtive sneer.
2437,I,
2438,I,"These are indeed but petty things,"
2439,I,And yet they touch some hearts like stings.
2440,I,
2441,I,But I acquit you of the shame
2442,I,Of being unresisting game;
2443,I,
2444,I,For you are of such tempered clay
2445,I,"As turns far stronger shafts away,"
2446,I,
2447,I,And all that foes or fools could guide
2448,I,Would only curl that lip of pride.
2449,I,
2450,I,"How then, O weary one! explain"
2451,I,The sources of that hidden pain?
2452,I,
2453,I,Alas! you have divined at length
2454,I,"How little you have used your strength,"
2455,I,
2456,I,"Which, with who knows what human good,"
2457,I,"Lies buried in that maidenhood,"
2458,I,
2459,I,"Where, as amid a field of flowers,"
2460,I,You have but played with April showers.
2461,I,
2462,I,"Ah! we would wish the world less fair,"
2463,I,"If Spring alone adorned the year,"
2464,I,
2465,I,"And Autumn came not with its fruit,"
2466,I,And Autumn hymns were ever mute.
2467,I,
2468,I,So I remark without surprise
2469,I,"That, as the unvarying season flies,"
2470,I,
2471,I,"From day to night and night to day,"
2472,I,You sicken of your endless May.
2473,I,
2474,I,In this poor life we may not cross
2475,I,"One virtuous instinct without loss,"
2476,I,
2477,I,And the soul grows not to its height
2478,I,Till love calls forth its utmost might.
2479,I,
2480,I,"Not blind to all you might have been,"
2481,I,And with some consciousness of sin--
2482,I,
2483,I,"Because with love you sometimes played,"
2484,I,"And choice, not fate, hath kept you maid--"
2485,I,
2486,I,You feel that you must pass from earth
2487,I,"But half-acquainted with its worth,"
2488,I,
2489,I,And that within your heart are deeps
2490,I,In which a nobler woman sleeps;
2491,I,
2492,I,"That not the maiden, but the wife"
2493,I,"Grasps the whole lesson of a life,"
2494,I,
2495,I,While such as you but sit and dream
2496,I,Along the surface of its stream.
2497,I,
2498,I,"And doubtless sometimes, all unsought,"
2499,I,"There comes upon your hour of thought,"
2500,I,
2501,I,"Despite the struggles of your will,"
2502,I,A sense of something absent still;
2503,I,
2504,I,And then you cannot help but yearn
2505,I,"To love and be beloved in turn,"
2506,I,
2507,I,"As they are loved, and love, who live"
2508,I,As love were all that life could give;
2509,I,
2510,I,And in a transient clasp or kiss
2511,I,Crowd an eternity of bliss;
2512,I,
2513,I,They who of every mortal joy
2514,I,"Taste always twice, nor feel them cloy,"
2515,I,
2516,I,"Or, if woes come, in Sorrow's hour"
2517,I,Are strengthened by a double power.
2518,I,
2519,I,
2520,II,II
2521,II,
2522,II,Here ends my feeble sketch of what
2523,II,"Might, but will never be your lot;"
2524,II,
2525,II,And I foresee how oft these rhymes
2526,II,Shall make you smile in after-times.
2527,II,
2528,II,"If I have read your nature right,"
2529,II,It only waits a spark of light;
2530,II,
2531,II,"And when that comes, as come it must,"
2532,II,"It will not fall on arid dust,"
2533,II,
2534,II,Nor yet on that which breaks to flame
2535,II,In the first blush of maiden shame;
2536,II,
2537,II,"But on a heart which, even at rest,"
2538,II,"Is warmer than an April nest,"
2539,II,
2540,II,"Where, settling soft, that spark shall creep"
2541,II,About as gently as a sleep;
2542,II,
2543,II,Still stealing on with pace so slow
2544,II,"Yourself will scarcely feel the glow,"
2545,II,
2546,II,"Till after many and many a day,"
2547,II,"Although no gleam its course betray,"
2548,II,
2549,II,"It shall attain the inmost shrine,"
2550,II,And wrap it in a fire divine!
2551,II,
2552,II,I know not when or whence indeed
2553,II,"Shall fall and burst the burning seed,"
2554,II,
2555,II,"But oh! once kindled, it will blaze,"
2556,II,"I know, forever!  By its rays"
2557,II,
2558,II,"You will perceive, with subtler eyes,"
2559,II,"The meaning in the earth and skies,"
2560,II,
2561,II,"Which, with their animated chain"
2562,II,"Of grass and flowers, and sun and rain,"
2563,II,
2564,II,"Of green below, and blue above,"
2565,II,Are but a type of married love.
2566,II,
2567,II,You will perceive that in the breast
2568,II,"The germs of many virtues rest,"
2569,II,
2570,II,"Which, ere they feel a lover's breath,"
2571,II,Lie in a temporary death;
2572,II,
2573,II,And till the heart is wooed and won
2574,II,It is an earth without a sun.
2575,II,
2576,II,
2577,III,III
2578,III,
2579,III,"But now, stand forth as sweet as life!"
2580,III,And let me paint you as a wife.
2581,III,
2582,III,"I note some changes in your face,"
2583,III,And in your mien a graver grace;
2584,III,
2585,III,Yet the calm forehead lightly bears
2586,III,Its weight of twice a score of years;
2587,III,
2588,III,And that one love which on this earth
2589,III,"Can wake the heart to all its worth,"
2590,III,
2591,III,And to their height can lift and bind
2592,III,"The powers of soul, and sense, and mind,"
2593,III,
2594,III,Hath not allowed a charm to fade--
2595,III,And the wife's lovelier than the maid.
2596,III,
2597,III,"An air of still, though bright repose"
2598,III,Tells that a tender hand bestows
2599,III,
2600,III,All that a generous manhood may
2601,III,"To make your life one bridal day,"
2602,III,
2603,III,"While the kind eyes betray no less,"
2604,III,"In their blue depths of tenderness,"
2605,III,
2606,III,That you have learned the truths which lie
2607,III,"Behind that holy mystery,"
2608,III,
2609,III,"Which, with its blisses and its woes,"
2610,III,Nor man nor maiden ever knows.
2611,III,
2612,III,"If now, as to the eyes of one"
2613,III,"Whose glance not even thought can shun,"
2614,III,
2615,III,"Your soul lay open to my view,"
2616,III,"I, looking all its nature through,"
2617,III,
2618,III,"Could see no incompleted part,"
2619,III,For the whole woman warms your heart.
2620,III,
2621,III,I cannot tell how many dead
2622,III,"You number in the cycles fled,"
2623,III,
2624,III,And you but look the more serene
2625,III,"For all the griefs you may have seen,"
2626,III,
2627,III,As you had gathered from the dust
2628,III,"The flowers of Peace, and Hope, and Trust."
2629,III,
2630,III,Your smile is even sweeter now
2631,III,"Than when it lit your maiden brow,"
2632,III,
2633,III,And that which wakes this gentler charm
2634,III,Coos at this moment on your arm.
2635,III,
2636,III,"Your voice was always soft in youth,"
2637,III,"And had the very sound of truth,"
2638,III,
2639,III,But never were its tones so mild
2640,III,Until you blessed your earliest child;
2641,III,
2642,III,And when to soothe some little wrong
2643,III,"It melts into a mother's song,"
2644,III,
2645,III,The same strange sweetness which in years
2646,III,"Long vanished filled the eyes with tears,"
2647,III,
2648,III,And (even when mirthful) gave always
2649,III,"A pathos to your girlish lays,"
2650,III,
2651,III,"Falls, with perchance a deeper thrill,"
2652,III,Upon the breathless listener still.
2653,III,
2654,III,I cannot guess in what fair spot
2655,III,"The chance of Time hath fixed your lot,"
2656,III,
2657,III,Nor can I name what manly breast
2658,III,Gives to that head a welcome rest;
2659,III,
2660,III,I cannot tell if partial Fate
2661,III,"Hath made you poor, or rich, or great;"
2662,III,
2663,III,"But oh! whatever be your place,"
2664,III,I never saw a form or face
2665,III,
2666,III,To which more plainly hath been lent
2667,III,The blessing of a full content!
2668,III,
2669,III,
2670,III,
2671,III,
2672,III,La Belle Juive
2673,III,
2674,III,
2675,III,
2676,III,Is it because your sable hair
2677,III,Is folded over brows that wear
2678,III,At times a too imperial air;
2679,III,
2680,III,Or is it that the thoughts which rise
2681,III,In those dark orbs do seek disguise
2682,III,Beneath the lids of Eastern eyes;
2683,III,
2684,III,That choose whatever pose or place
2685,III,"May chance to please, in you I trace"
2686,III,The noblest woman of your race?
2687,III,
2688,III,"The crowd is sauntering at its ease,"
2689,III,And humming like a hive of bees--
2690,III,You take your seat and touch the keys:
2691,III,
2692,III,I do not hear the giddy throng;
2693,III,"The sea avenges Israel's wrong,"
2694,III,And on the wind floats Miriam's song!
2695,III,
2696,III,You join me with a stately grace;
2697,III,Music to Poesy gives place;
2698,III,Some grand emotion lights your face:
2699,III,
2700,III,At once I stand by Mizpeh's walls:
2701,III,"With smiles the martyred daughter falls,"
2702,III,And desolate are Mizpeh's halls!
2703,III,
2704,III,Intrusive babblers come between;
2705,III,"With calm, pale brow and lofty mien,"
2706,III,You thread the circle like a queen!
2707,III,
2708,III,Then sweeps the royal Esther by;
2709,III,The deep devotion in her eye
2710,III,"Is looking ""If I die, I die!"""
2711,III,
2712,III,You stroll the garden's flowery walks;
2713,III,"The plants to me are grainless stalks,"
2714,III,And Ruth to old Naomi talks.
2715,III,
2716,III,"Adopted child of Judah's creed,"
2717,III,"Like Judah's daughters, true at need,"
2718,III,I see you mid the alien seed.
2719,III,
2720,III,I watch afar the gleaner sweet;
2721,III,"I wake like Boaz in the wheat,"
2722,III,And find you lying at my feet!
2723,III,
2724,III,My feet!  Oh! if the spell that lures
2725,III,"My heart through all these dreams endures,"
2726,III,How soon shall I be stretched at yours!
2727,III,
2728,III,
2729,III,
2730,III,
2731,III,An Exotic
2732,III,
2733,III,
2734,III,
2735,III,Not in a climate near the sun
2736,III,"Did the cloud with its trailing fringes float,"
2737,III,"Whence, white as the down of an angel's plume,"
2738,III,Fell the snow of her brow and throat.
2739,III,
2740,III,And the ground had been rich for a thousand years
2741,III,"With the blood of heroes, and sages, and kings,"
2742,III,Where the rose that blooms in her exquisite cheek
2743,III,Unfolded the flush of its wings.
2744,III,
2745,III,"On a land where the faces are fair, though pale"
2746,III,"As a moonlit mist when the winds are still,"
2747,III,She breaks like a morning in Paradise
2748,III,Through the palms of an orient hill.
2749,III,
2750,III,"Her beauty, perhaps, were all too bright,"
2751,III,"But about her there broods some delicate spell,"
2752,III,Whence the wondrous charm of the girl grows soft
2753,III,As the light in an English dell.
2754,III,
2755,III,There is not a story of faith and truth
2756,III,"On the starry scroll of her country's fame,"
2757,III,"But has helped to shape her stately mien,"
2758,III,And to touch her soul with flame.
2759,III,
2760,III,"I sometimes forget, as she sweeps me a bow,"
2761,III,"That I gaze on a simple English maid,"
2762,III,"And I bend my head, as if to a queen"
2763,III,Who is courting my lance and blade.
2764,III,
2765,III,"Once, as we read, in a curtained niche,"
2766,III,"A poet who sang of her sea-throned isle,"
2767,III,There was something of Albion's mighty Bess
2768,III,In the flash of her haughty smile.
2769,III,
2770,III,She seemed to gather from every age
2771,III,"All the greatness of England about her there,"
2772,III,And my fancy wove a royal crown
2773,III,Of the dusky gold of her hair.
2774,III,
2775,III,"But it was no queen to whom that day,"
2776,III,"In the dim green shade of a trellised vine,"
2777,III,I whispered a hope that had somewhat to do
2778,III,With a small white hand in mine.
2779,III,
2780,III,"The Tudor had vanished, and, as I spoke,"
2781,III,"'T was herself looked out of her frank brown eye,"
2782,III,"And an answer was burning upon her face,"
2783,III,Ere I caught the low reply.
2784,III,
2785,III,What was it!  Nothing the world need know--
2786,III,"The stars saw our parting!  Enough, that then"
2787,III,"I walked from the porch with the tread of a king,"
2788,III,And she was a queen again!
2789,III,
2790,III,
2791,III,
2792,III,
2793,III,The Rosebuds
2794,III,
2795,III,
2796,III,
2797,III,"Yes, in that dainty ivory shrine,"
2798,III,"With those three pallid buds, I twine"
2799,III,And fold away a dream divine!
2800,III,
2801,III,One night they lay upon a breast
2802,III,"Where Love hath made his fragrant nest,"
2803,III,And throned me as a life-long guest.
2804,III,
2805,III,Near that chaste heart they seemed to me
2806,III,Types of far fairer flowers to be--
2807,III,The rosebuds of a human tree!
2808,III,
2809,III,"Buds that shall bloom beside my hearth,"
2810,III,And there be held of richer worth
2811,III,Than all the kingliest gems of earth.
2812,III,
2813,III,Ah me! the pathos of the thought!
2814,III,I had not deemed she wanted aught;
2815,III,Yet what a tenderer charm it wrought!
2816,III,
2817,III,I know not if she marked the flame
2818,III,"That lit my cheek, but not from shame,"
2819,III,When one sweet image dimly came.
2820,III,
2821,III,There was a murmur soft and low;
2822,III,"White folds of cambric, parted slow;"
2823,III,And little fingers played with snow!
2824,III,
2825,III,"How far my fancy dared to stray,"
2826,III,A lover's reverence needs not say--
2827,III,Enough--the vision passed away!
2828,III,
2829,III,"Passed in a mist of happy tears,"
2830,III,While something in my trancèd ears
2831,III,Hummed like the future in a seer's!
2832,III,
2833,III,
2834,III,
2835,III,
2836,III,A Mother's Wail
2837,III,
2838,III,
2839,III,
2840,III,My babe! my tiny babe! my only babe!
2841,III,My single rose-bud in a crown of thorns!
2842,III,"My lamp that in that narrow hut of life,"
2843,III,Whence I looked forth upon a night of storm!
2844,III,Burned with the lustre of the moon and stars!
2845,III,
2846,III,My babe! my tiny babe! my only babe!
2847,III,Behold the bud is gone! the thorns remain!
2848,III,"My lamp hath fallen from its niche--ah, me!"
2849,III,"Earth drinks the fragrant flame, and I am left"
2850,III,Forever and forever in the dark!
2851,III,
2852,III,My babe! my babe! my own and only babe!
2853,III,Where art thou now?  If somewhere in the sky
2854,III,"An angel hold thee in his radiant arms,"
2855,III,I challenge him to clasp thy tender form
2856,III,With half the fervor of a mother's love!
2857,III,
2858,III,"Forgive me, Lord! forgive my reckless grief!"
2859,III,"Forgive me that this rebel, selfish heart"
2860,III,"Would almost make me jealous for my child,"
2861,III,"Though thy own lap enthroned him.  Lord, thou hast"
2862,III,So many such!  I have--ah! had but one!
2863,III,
2864,III,"O yet once more, my babe, to hear thy cry!"
2865,III,"O yet once more, my babe, to see thy smile!"
2866,III,O yet once more to feel against my breast
2867,III,"Those cool, soft hands, that warm, wet, eager mouth,"
2868,III,With the sweet sharpness of its budding pearls!
2869,III,
2870,III,"But it must never, never more be mine"
2871,III,"To mark the growing meaning in thine eyes,"
2872,III,"To watch thy soul unfolding leaf by leaf,"
2873,III,"Or catch, with ever fresh surprise and joy,"
2874,III,Thy dawning recognitions of the world.
2875,III,
2876,III,"Three different shadows of thyself, my babe,"
2877,III,"Change with each other while I weep.  The first,"
2878,III,"The sweetest, yet the not least fraught with pain,"
2879,III,"Clings like my living boy around my neck,"
2880,III,Or purrs and murmurs softly at my feet!
2881,III,
2882,III,Another is a little mound of earth;
2883,III,"That comes the oftenest, darling!  In my dreams,"
2884,III,"I see it beaten by the midnight rain,"
2885,III,Or chilled beneath the moon.  Ah! what a couch
2886,III,For that which I have shielded from a breath
2887,III,That would not stir the violets on thy grave!
2888,III,
2889,III,"The third, my precious babe! the third, O Lord!"
2890,III,"Is a fair cherub face beyond the stars,"
2891,III,"Wearing the roses of a mystic bliss,"
2892,III,Yet sometimes not unsaddened by a glance
2893,III,Turned earthward on a mother in her woe!
2894,III,
2895,III,"This is the vision, Lord, that I would keep"
2896,III,"Before me always.  But, alas! as yet,"
2897,III,"It is the dimmest and the rarest, too!"
2898,III,"O touch my sight, or break the cloudy bars"
2899,III,"That hide it, lest I madden where I kneel!"

2905,III,
2906,III,
2907,III,
2908,III,"'T was merry Christmas when he came,"
2909,III,Our little boy beneath the sod;
2910,III,"And brighter burned the Christmas flame,"
2911,III,"And merrier sped the Christmas game,"
2912,III,Because within the house there lay
2913,III,A shape as tiny as a fay--
2914,III,The Christmas gift of God!
2915,III,In wreaths and garlands on the walls
2916,III,"The holly hung its ruby balls,"
2917,III,The mistletoe its pearls;
2918,III,And a Christmas tree's fantastic fruits
2919,III,Woke laughter like a choir of flutes
2920,III,From happy boys and girls.
2921,III,"For the mirth, which else had swelled as shrill"
2922,III,"As a school let loose to its errant will,"
2923,III,"Was softened by the thought,"
2924,III,That in a dim hushed room above
2925,III,A mother's pains in a mother's love
2926,III,Were only just forgot.
2927,III,"The jest, the tale, the toast, the glee,"
2928,III,All took a sober tone;
2929,III,"We spoke of the babe upstairs, as we"
2930,III,Held festival for him alone.
2931,III,"When the bells rang in the Christmas morn,"
2932,III,It scarcely seemed a sin to say
2933,III,"That they rang because that babe was born,"
2934,III,Not less than for the sacred day.
2935,III,Ah! Christ forgive us for the crime
2936,III,Which drowned the memories of the time
2937,III,In a merely mortal bliss!
2938,III,We owned the error when the mirth
2939,III,Of another Christmas lit the hearth
2940,III,Of every home but this.
2941,III,"When, in that lonely burial-ground,"
2942,III,With every Christmas sight and sound
2943,III,"Removed or shunned, we kept"
2944,III,A mournful Christmas by the mound
2945,III,Where little Willie slept!
2946,III,
2947,III,"Ah, hapless mother! darling wife!"
2948,III,"I might say nothing more,"
2949,III,And the dull cold world would hold
2950,III,The story of that precious life
2951,III,As amply told!
2952,III,"Shall we, shall you and I, before"
2953,III,That world's unsympathetic eyes
2954,III,Lay other relics from our store
2955,III,Of tender memories?
2956,III,What could it know of the joy and love
2957,III,That throbbed and smiled and wept above
2958,III,An unresponsive thing?
2959,III,And who could share the ecstatic thrill
2960,III,With which we watched the upturned bill
2961,III,Of our bird at its living spring?
2962,III,"Shall we tell how in the time gone by,"
2963,III,"Beneath all changes of the sky,"
2964,III,And in an ordinary home
2965,III,"Amid the city's din,"
2966,III,"Life was to us a crystal dome,"
2967,III,Our babe the flame therein?
2968,III,Ah! this were jargon on the mart;
2969,III,"And though some gentle friend,"
2970,III,"And many and many a suffering heart,"
2971,III,"Would weep and comprehend,"
2972,III,Yet even these might fail to see
2973,III,What we saw daily in the child--
2974,III,"Not the mere creature undefiled,"
2975,III,But the winged cherub soon to be.
2976,III,That wandering hand which seemed to reach
2977,III,"At angel finger-tips,"
2978,III,And that murmur like a mystic speech
2979,III,"Upon the rosy lips,"
2980,III,That something in the serious face
2981,III,"Holier than even its infant grace,"
2982,III,"And that rapt gaze on empty space,"
2983,III,"Which made us, half believing, say,"
2984,III,"""Ah, little wide-eyed seer! who knows"
2985,III,But that for you this chamber glows
2986,III,"With stately shapes and solemn shows?"""
2987,III,"Which touched us, too, with vague alarms,"
2988,III,Lest in the circle of our arms
2989,III,We held a being less akin
2990,III,To his parents in a world of sin
2991,III,Than to beings not of clay:
2992,III,"How could we speak in human phrase,"
2993,III,"Of such scarce earthly traits and ways,"
2994,III,What would not seem
2995,III,"A doting dream,"
2996,III,In the creed of these sordid days?
2997,III,No! let us keep
2998,III,"Deep, deep,"
2999,III,"In sorrowing heart and aching brain,"
3000,III,"This story hidden with the pain,"
3001,III,Which since that blue October night
3002,III,"When Willie vanished from our sight,"
3003,III,Must haunt us even in our sleep.
3004,III,"In the gloom of the chamber where he died,"
3005,III,"And by that grave which, through our care,"
3006,III,"From Yule to Yule of every year,"
3007,III,Is made like Spring to bloom;
3008,III,"And where, at times, we catch the sigh"
3009,III,"As of an angel floating nigh,"
3010,III,Who longs but has not power to tell
3011,III,That in that violet-shrouded cell
3012,III,Lies nothing better than the shell
3013,III,Which he had cast aside--
3014,III,"By that sweet grave, in that dark room,"
3015,III,"We may weave at will for each other's ear,"
3016,III,"Of that life, and that love, and that early doom,"
3017,III,The tale which is shadowed here:
3018,III,To us alone it will always be
3019,III,As fresh as our own misery;
3020,III,"But enough, alas! for the world is said,"
3021,III,"In the brief ""Here lieth"" of the dead!"

3028,III,A Prize Poem
3029,III,
3030,III,
3031,III,
3032,III,A fairy ring
3033,III,Drawn in the crimson of a battle-plain--
3034,III,From whose weird circle every loathsome thing
3035,III,And sight and sound of pain
3036,III,"Are banished, while about it in the air,"
3037,III,"And from the ground, and from the low-hung skies,"
3038,III,"Throng, in a vision fair"
3039,III,"As ever lit a prophet's dying eyes,"
3040,III,Gleams of that unseen world
3041,III,"That lies about us, rainbow-tinted shapes"
3042,III,"With starry wings unfurled,"
3043,III,Poised for a moment on such airy capes
3044,III,As pierce the golden foam
3045,III,Of sunset's silent main--
3046,III,"Would image what in this enchanted dome,"
3047,III,Amid the night of war and death
3048,III,"In which the armèd city draws its breath,"
3049,III,We have built up!
3050,III,For though no wizard wand or magic cup
3051,III,"The spell hath wrought,"
3052,III,"Within this charmëd fane, we ope the gates"
3053,III,"Of that divinest Fairy-land,"
3054,III,Where under loftier fates
3055,III,"Than rule the vulgar earth on which we stand,"
3056,III,Move the bright creatures of the realm of thought.
3057,III,Shut for one happy evening from the flood
3058,III,"That roars around us, here you may behold--"
3059,III,As if a desert way
3060,III,Could blossom and unfold
3061,III,A garden fresh with May--
3062,III,"Substantialized in breathing flesh and blood,"
3063,III,Souls that upon the poet's page
3064,III,"Have lived from age to age,"
3065,III,And yet have never donned this mortal clay.
3066,III,A golden strand
3067,III,Shall sometimes spread before you like the isle
3068,III,Where fair Miranda's smile
3069,III,Met the sweet stranger whom the father's art
3070,III,"Had led unto her heart,"
3071,III,"Which, like a bud that waited for the light,"
3072,III,Burst into bloom at sight!
3073,III,Love shall grow softer in each maiden's eyes
3074,III,"As Juliet leans her cheek upon her hand,"
3075,III,And prattles to the night.
3076,III,"Anon, a reverend form,"
3077,III,"With tattered robe and forehead bare,"
3078,III,"That challenge all the torments of the air,"
3079,III,Goes by!
3080,III,"And the pent feelings choke in one long sigh,"
3081,III,"While, as the mimic thunder rolls, you hear"
3082,III,The noble wreck of Lear
3083,III,"Reproach like things of life the ancient skies,"
3084,III,And commune with the storm!
3085,III,"Lo! next a dim and silent chamber where,"
3086,III,"Wrapt in glad dreams in which, perchance, the Moor"
3087,III,"Tells his strange story o'er,"
3088,III,"The gentle Desdemona chastely lies,"
3089,III,Unconscious of the loving murderer nigh.
3090,III,Then through a hush like death
3091,III,Stalks Denmark's mailëd ghost!
3092,III,And Hamlet enters with that thoughtful breath
3093,III,Which is the trumpet to a countless host
3094,III,"Of reasons, but which wakes no deed from sleep;"
3095,III,"For while it calls to strife,"
3096,III,He pauses on the very brink of fact
3097,III,"To toy as with the shadow of an act,"
3098,III,And utter those wise saws that cut so deep
3099,III,Into the core of life!
3100,III,
3101,III,Nor shall be wanting many a scene
3102,III,"Where forms of more familiar mien,"
3103,III,"Moving through lowlier pathways, shall present"
3104,III,"The world of every day,"
3105,III,"Such as it whirls along the busy quay,"
3106,III,"Or sits beneath a rustic orchard wall,"
3107,III,"Or floats about a fashion-freighted hall,"
3108,III,Or toils in attics dark the night away.
3109,III,"Love, hate, grief, joy, gain, glory, shame, shall meet,"
3110,III,As in the round wherein our lives are pent;
3111,III,"Chance for a while shall seem to reign,"
3112,III,"While Goodness roves like Guilt about the street,"
3113,III,And Guilt looks innocent.
3114,III,"But all at last shall vindicate the right,"
3115,III,"Crime shall be meted with its proper pain,"
3116,III,"Motes shall be taken from the doubter's sight,"
3117,III,And Fortune's general justice rendered plain.
3118,III,"Of honest laughter there shall be no dearth,"
3119,III,"Wit shall shake hands with humor grave and sweet,"
3120,III,"Our wisdom shall not be too wise for mirth,"
3121,III,Nor kindred follies want a fool to greet.
3122,III,As sometimes from the meanest spot of earth
3123,III,"A sudden beauty unexpected starts,"
3124,III,So you shall find some germs of hidden worth
3125,III,Within the vilest hearts;
3126,III,"And now and then, when in those moods that turn"
3127,III,"To the cold Muse that whips a fault with sneers,"
3128,III,"You shall, perchance, be strangely touched to learn"
3129,III,You've struck a spring of tears!
3130,III,
3131,III,"But while we lead you thus from change to change,"
3132,III,Shall we not find within our ample range
3133,III,Some type to elevate a people's heart--
3134,III,Some hero who shall teach a hero's part
3135,III,In this distracted time?
3136,III,"Rise from thy sleep of ages, noble Tell!"
3137,III,"And, with the Alpine thunders of thy voice,"
3138,III,As if across the billows unenthralled
3139,III,"Thy Alps unto the Alleghanies called,"
3140,III,Bid Liberty rejoice!
3141,III,Proclaim upon this trans-Atlantic strand
3142,III,"The deeds which, more than their own awful mien,"
3143,III,Make every crag of Switzerland sublime!
3144,III,"And say to those whose feeble souls would lean,"
3145,III,"Not on themselves, but on some outstretched hand,"
3146,III,That once a single mind sufficed to quell
3147,III,The malice of a tyrant; let them know
3148,III,"That each may crowd in every well-aimed blow,"
3149,III,"Not the poor strength alone of arm and brand,"
3150,III,But the whole spirit of a mighty land!
3151,III,
3152,III,"Bid Liberty rejoice!  Aye, though its day"
3153,III,"Be far or near, these clouds shall yet be red"
3154,III,With the large promise of the coming ray.
3155,III,"Meanwhile, with that calm courage which can smile"
3156,III,"Amid the terrors of the wildest fray,"
3157,III,Let us among the charms of Art awhile
3158,III,Fleet the deep gloom away;
3159,III,Nor yet forget that on each hand and head
3160,III,Rest the dear rights for which we fight and pray.

3173,I,
3174,I,"In a far country, and a distant age,"
3175,I,"Ere sprites and fays had bade farewell to earth,"
3176,I,A boy was born of humble parentage;
3177,I,The stars that shone upon his lonely birth
3178,I,Did seem to promise sovereignty and fame--
3179,I,Yet no tradition hath preserved his name.
3180,I,
3181,II,II
3182,II,
3183,II,"'T is said that on the night when he was born,"
3184,II,A beauteous shape swept slowly through the room;
3185,II,"Its eyes broke on the infant like a morn,"
3186,II,And his cheek brightened like a rose in bloom;
3187,II,But as it passed away there followed after
3188,II,"A sigh of pain, and sounds of elvish laughter."
3189,II,
3190,III,III
3191,III,
3192,III,And so his parents deemed him to be blest
3193,III,Beyond the lot of mortals; they were poor
3194,III,As the most timid bird that stored its nest
3195,III,With the stray gleanings at their cottage-door:
3196,III,"Yet they contrived to rear their little dove,"
3197,III,And he repaid them with the tenderest love.
3198,III,
3199,IV,IV
3200,IV,
3201,IV,"The child was very beautiful in sooth,"
3202,IV,And as he waxed in years grew lovelier still;
3203,IV,On his fair brow the aureole of truth
3204,IV,"Beamed, and the purest maidens, with a thrill,"
3205,IV,"Looked in his eyes, and from their heaven of blue"
3206,IV,Saw thoughts like sinless Angels peering through.
3207,IV,
3208,V,V
3209,V,
3210,V,Need there was none of censure or of praise
3211,V,To mould him to the kind parental hand;
3212,V,"Yet there was ever something in his ways,"
3213,V,Which those about him could not understand;
3214,V,"A self-withdrawn and independent bliss,"
3215,V,"Beside the father's love, the mother's kiss."
3216,V,
3217,VI,VI
3218,VI,
3219,VI,"For oft, when he believed himself alone,"
3220,VI,"They caught brief snatches of mysterious rhymes,"
3221,VI,"Which he would murmur in an undertone,"
3222,VI,Like a pleased bee's in summer; and at times
3223,VI,"A strange far look would come into his eyes,"
3224,VI,As if he saw a vision in the skies.
3225,VI,
3226,VII,VII
3227,VII,
3228,VII,And he upon a simple leaf would pore
3229,VII,As if its very texture unto him
3230,VII,"Had some deep meaning; sometimes by the door,"
3231,VII,"From noon until a summer-day grew dim,"
3232,VII,He lay and watched the clouds; and to his thought
3233,VII,Night with her stars but fitful slumbers brought.
3234,VII,
3235,VIII,VIII
3236,VIII,
3237,VIII,"In the long hours of twilight, when the breeze"
3238,VIII,"Talked in low tones along the woodland rills,"
3239,VIII,Or the loud North its stormy minstrelsies
3240,VIII,"Blent with wild noises from the distant hills,"
3241,VIII,The boy--his rosy hand against his ear
3242,VIII,"Curved like a sea-shell--hushed as some rapt seer,"
3243,VIII,
3244,IX,IX
3245,IX,
3246,IX,"Followed the sounds, and ever and again,"
3247,IX,"As the wind came and went, in storm or play,"
3248,IX,He seemed to hearken as to some far strain
3249,IX,Of mingled voices calling him away;
3250,IX,And they who watched him held their breath to trace
3251,IX,The still and fixed attention in his face.
3252,IX,
3253,X,X
3254,X,
3255,X,"Once, on a cold and loud-voiced winter night,"
3256,X,The three were seated by their cottage-fire--
3257,X,The mother watching by its flickering light
3258,X,"The wakeful urchin, and the dozing sire;"
3259,X,"There was a brief, quick motion like a bird's,"
3260,X,And the boy's thought thus rippled into words:
3261,X,
3262,XI,XI
3263,XI,
3264,XI,"""O mother! thou hast taught me many things,"
3265,XI,But none I think more beautiful than speech--
3266,XI,A nobler power than even those broad wings
3267,XI,"I used to pray for, when I longed to reach"
3268,XI,"That distant peak which on our vale looks down,"
3269,XI,And wears the star of evening for a crown.
3270,XI,
3271,XII,XII
3272,XII,
3273,XII,"""But, mother, while our human words are rife"
3274,XII,"To us with meaning, other sounds there be"
3275,XII,"Which seem, and are, the language of a life"
3276,XII,"Around, yet unlike ours:  winds talk; the sea"
3277,XII,"Murmurs articulately, and the sky"
3278,XII,"Listens, and answers, though inaudibly."
3279,XII,
3280,XIII,XIII
3281,XIII,
3282,XIII,"""By stream and spring, in glades and woodlands lone,"
3283,XIII,Beside our very cot I've gathered flowers
3284,XIII,Inscribed with signs and characters unknown;
3285,XIII,But the frail scrolls still baffle all my powers:
3286,XIII,What is this language and where is the key
3287,XIII,That opes its weird and wondrous mystery?
3288,XIII,
3289,XIV,XIV
3290,XIV,
3291,XIV,"""The forests know it, and the mountains know,"
3292,XIV,And it is written in the sunset's dyes;
3293,XIV,A revelation to the world below
3294,XIV,Is daily going on before our eyes;
3295,XIV,"And, but for sinful thoughts, I do not doubt"
3296,XIV,That we could spell the thrilling secret out.
3297,XIV,
3298,XV,XV
3299,XV,
3300,XV,"""O mother! somewhere on this lovely earth"
3301,XV,"I lived, and understood that mystic tongue,"
3302,XV,"But, for some reason, to my second birth"
3303,XV,"Only the dullest memories have clung,"
3304,XV,Like that fair tree that even while blossoming
3305,XV,Keeps the dead berries of a former spring.
3306,XV,
3307,XVI,XVI
3308,XVI,
3309,XVI,"""Who shall put life in these?--my nightly dreams"
3310,XVI,Some teacher of supernal powers foretell;
3311,XVI,"A fair and stately shape appears, which seems"
3312,XVI,"Bright with all truth; and once, in a dark dell"
3313,XVI,"Within the forest, unto me there came"
3314,XVI,"A voice that must be hers, which called my name."""
3315,XVI,
3316,XVII,XVII
3317,XVII,
3318,XVII,"Puzzled and frightened, wondering more and more,"
3319,XVII,"The mother heard, but did not comprehend;"
3320,XVII,"""So early dallying with forbidden lore!"
3321,XVII,"Oh, what will chance, and wherein will it end?"
3322,XVII,"My child! my child!"" she caught him to her breast,"
3323,XVII,"""Oh, let me kiss these wildering thoughts to rest!"
3324,XVII,
3325,XVIII,XVIII
3326,XVIII,
3327,XVIII,"""They cannot come from God, who freely gives"

3329,XVIII,"Beware, my son! some evil influence strives"
3330,XVIII,"To grieve thy parents, and to work thee woe;"
3331,XVIII,Alas! the vision I misunderstood!
3332,XVIII,"It could not be an angel fair and good."""
3333,XVIII,
3334,XIX,XIX
3335,XIX,
3336,XIX,"And then, in low and tremulous tones, she told"
3337,XIX,"The story of his birth-night; the boy's eyes,"
3338,XIX,"As the wild tale went on, were bright and bold,"
3339,XIX,With a weird look that did not seem surprise:
3340,XIX,"""Perhaps,"" he said, ""this lady and her elves"
3341,XIX,"Will one day come, and take me to themselves."""
3342,XIX,
3343,XX,XX
3344,XX,
3345,XX,"""And wouldst thou leave us?""  ""Dearest mother, no!"
3346,XX,Hush! I will check these thoughts that give thee pain;
3347,XX,"Or, if they flow, as they perchance must flow,"
3348,XX,At least I will not utter them again;
3349,XX,Hark! didst thou hear a voice like many streams?
3350,XX,"Mother! it is the spirit of my dreams!"""
3351,XX,
3352,XXI,XXI
3353,XXI,
3354,XXI,"Thenceforth, whatever impulse stirred below,"
3355,XXI,"In the deep heart beneath that childish breast,"
3356,XXI,"Those lips were sealed, and though the eye would glow,"
3357,XXI,Yet the brow wore an air of perfect rest;
3358,XXI,"Cheerful, content, with calm though strong control"
3359,XXI,He shut the temple-portals of his soul.
3360,XXI,
3361,XXII,XXII
3362,XXII,
3363,XXII,And when too restlessly the mighty throng
3364,XXII,"Of fancies woke within his teeming mind,"
3365,XXII,"All silently they formed in glorious song,"
3366,XXII,"And floated off unheard, and undivined,"
3367,XXII,Perchance not lost--with many a voiceless prayer
3368,XXII,"They reached the sky, and found some record there."
3369,XXII,
3370,XXIII,XXIII
3371,XXIII,
3372,XXIII,Softly and swiftly sped the quiet days;
3373,XXIII,"The thoughtful boy has blossomed into youth,"
3374,XXIII,"And still no maiden would have feared his gaze,"
3375,XXIII,And still his brow was noble with the truth:
3376,XXIII,"Yet, though he masks the pain with pious art,"

3380,XXIV,
3381,XXIV,A childish dream is now a deathless need
3382,XXIV,Which drives him to far hills and distant wilds;
3383,XXIV,The solemn faith and fervor of his creed
3384,XXIV,"Bold as a martyr's, simple as a child's;"
3385,XXIV,"The eagle knew him as she knew the blast,"
3386,XXIV,And the deer did not flee him as he passed.

3390,XXV,"But gentle even in his wildest mood,"

3393,XXV,"Couched like a milder sunshine on the heather,"

3400,XXVI,Remote and quiet as its quiet skies;

3402,XXVI,Full of his own sweet thoughts and memories;
3403,XXVI,"Dark oaks and fluted chestnuts gathering round,"
3404,XXVI,Pillared and greenly domed a sloping mound.

3411,XXVII,"Glanced the clear sunshine, fell the fruitful showers,"
3412,XXVII,And here the shyest bird would fold her wings;

4184,XXVIII,"Trees of the soberest hues, thick-leaved and tall,"
4185,XXVIII,"Arch it o'erhead and column it around,"
4186,XXVIII,"Framing a covert, natural and wild,"
4187,XXVIII,Domelike and dim; though nowhere so enclosed
4188,XXVIII,But that the gentlest breezes reach the spot
4189,XXVIII,Unwearied and unweakened.  Sound is here
4190,XXVIII,A transient and unfrequent visitor;
4191,XXVIII,"Yet if the day be calm, not often then,"
4192,XXVIII,Whilst the high pines in one another's arms
4193,XXVIII,"Sleep, you may sometimes with unstartled ear"

4199,XXVIII,Gleams like a sapphire set in emerald.
4200,XXVIII,"A narrow opening in the branchëd roof,"
4201,XXVIII,"A single one, is large enough to show,"
4202,XXVIII,"With that half glimpse a dreamer loves so much,"
4203,XXVIII,The blue air and the blessing of the sky.
4204,XXVIII,"Thither I always bent my idle steps,"

4210,XXVIII,"One knows not whither, I, most sick in mind"
4211,XXVIII,"With thoughts that shall be nameless, yet, no doubt,"
4212,XXVIII,"Wrong, or at least unhealthful, since though dark"
4213,XXVIII,"With gloom, and touched with discontent, they had"
4214,XXVIII,"No adequate excuse, nor cause, nor end,"
4215,XXVIII,"I, with these thoughts, and on this summer day,"
4216,XXVIII,"Entered the accustomed haunt, and found for once"
4217,XXVIII,No medicinal virtue.
4218,XXVIII,Not a leaf

4222,XXVIII,"Hung lax and lifeless.  Something in the place,"
4223,XXVIII,"Its utter stillness, the unusual heat,"
4224,XXVIII,"And some more secret influence, I thought,"
4225,XXVIII,"Weighed on the sense like sin.  Above I saw,"
4226,XXVIII,"Though not a cloud was visible in heaven,"
4227,XXVIII,The pallid sky look through a glazëd mist
4228,XXVIII,Like a blue eye in death.
4229,XXVIII,"The change, perhaps,"
4230,XXVIII,"Was natural enough; my jaundiced sight,"
4231,XXVIII,"The weather, and the time explain it all:"
4232,XXVIII,"Yet have I drawn a lesson from the spot,"
4233,XXVIII,And shrined it in these verses for my heart.
4234,XXVIII,Thenceforth those tranquil precincts I have sought
4235,XXVIII,"Not less, and in all shades of various moods;"
4236,XXVIII,But always shun to desecrate the spot
4237,XXVIII,"By vain repinings, sickly sentiments,"
4238,XXVIII,"Or inconclusive sorrows.  Nature, though"
4239,XXVIII,Pure as she was in Eden when her breath
4240,XXVIII,"Kissed the white brow of Eve, doth not refuse,"
4241,XXVIII,"In her own way and with a just reserve,"
4242,XXVIII,To sympathize with human suffering;
4243,XXVIII,"But for the pains, the fever, and the fret"
4244,XXVIII,"Engendered of a weak, unquiet heart,"
4245,XXVIII,She hath no solace; and who seeks her when
4246,XXVIII,"These be the troubles over which he moans,"
4247,XXVIII,Reads in her unreplying lineaments
4248,XXVIII,"Rebukes, that, to the guilty consciousness,"
4249,XXVIII,Strike like contempt.

4273,XXVIII,And soon I put my shallow studies by;
4274,XXVIII,"Then, sick at heart, and angered by the book,"
4275,XXVIII,"Which, in good sooth, was but the long-drawn sigh"
4276,XXVIII,"Of some one who had quarreled with his kind,"
4277,XXVIII,"Vexed at the very proofs which I had sought,"
4278,XXVIII,And all annoyed while all alert to find
4279,XXVIII,"A plausible likeness of my own dark thought,"
4280,XXVIII,"I cast me down beneath yon oak's wide boughs,"
4281,XXVIII,"And, shielding with both hands my throbbing brows,"
4282,XXVIII,Watched lazily the shadows of my brain.
4283,XXVIII,"The feeble tide of peevishness went down,"
4284,XXVIII,"And left a flat dull waste of dreary pain,"
4285,XXVIII,Which seemed to clog the blood in every vein;
4286,XXVIII,"The world, of course, put on its darkest frown--"
4287,XXVIII,In all its realms I saw no mortal crown
4288,XXVIII,Which did not wound or crush some restless head;
4289,XXVIII,"And hope, and will, and motive, all were dead."
4290,XXVIII,"So, passive as a stone, I felt too low"
4291,XXVIII,To claim a kindred with the humblest flower;
4292,XXVIII,"Even that would bare its bosom to a shower,"
4293,XXVIII,"While I henceforth would take no pains to live,"
4294,XXVIII,Nor place myself where I might feel or give
4295,XXVIII,A single impulse whence a wish could grow.
4296,XXVIII,There was a tulip scarce a gossamer's throw
4297,XXVIII,"Beyond that platanus.  A little child,"
4298,XXVIII,"Most dear to me, looked through the fence and smiled"
4299,XXVIII,A hint that I should pluck it for her sake.
4300,XXVIII,"Ah, me! I trust I was not well awake--"
4301,XXVIII,"The voice was very sweet,"
4302,XXVIII,Yet a faint languor kept me in my seat.
4303,XXVIII,"I saw a pouted lip, a toss, and heard"
4304,XXVIII,"Some low expostulating tones, but stirred"
4305,XXVIII,"Not even a leaf's length, till the pretty fay,"
4306,XXVIII,"Wondering, and half abashed at the wild feat,"
4307,XXVIII,"Climbed the low pales, and laughed my gloom away."
4308,XXVIII,"And here again, but led by other powers,"
4309,XXVIII,"A morning and a golden afternoon,"
4310,XXVIII,"These happy stars, and yonder setting moon,"
4311,XXVIII,"Have seen me speed, unreckoned and untasked,"
4312,XXVIII,A round of precious hours.
4313,XXVIII,"Oh! here, where in that summer noon I basked,"
4314,XXVIII,"And strove, with logic frailer than the flowers,"
4315,XXVIII,"To justify a life of sensuous rest,"
4316,XXVIII,"A question dear as home or heaven was asked,"
4317,XXVIII,And without language answered.  I was blest!
4318,XXVIII,Blest with those nameless boons too sweet to trust
4319,XXVIII,Unto the telltale confidence of song.
4320,XXVIII,"Love to his own glad self is sometimes coy,"
4321,XXVIII,And even thus much doth seem to do him wrong;
4322,XXVIII,"While in the fears which chasten mortal joy,"
4323,XXVIII,"Is one that shuts the lips, lest speech too free,"
4324,XXVIII,"With the cold touch of hard reality,"
4325,XXVIII,Should turn its priceless jewels into dust.
4326,XXVIII,"Since that long kiss which closed the morning's talk,"
4327,XXVIII,I have not strayed beyond this garden walk.
4328,XXVIII,"As yet a vague delight is all I know,"
4329,XXVIII,"A sense of joy so wild 't is almost pain,"
4330,XXVIII,"And like a trouble drives me to and fro,"
4331,XXVIII,And will not pause to count its own sweet gain.
4332,XXVIII,I am so happy! that is all my thought.
4333,XXVIII,"To-morrow I will turn it round and round,"
4334,XXVIII,And seek to know its limits and its ground.
4335,XXVIII,To-morrow I will task my heart to learn
4336,XXVIII,"The duties which shall spring from such a seed,"
4337,XXVIII,"And where it must be sown, and how be wrought."
4338,XXVIII,But oh! this reckless bliss is bliss indeed!
4339,XXVIII,And for one day I choose to seal the urn
4340,XXVIII,Wherein is shrined Love's missal and his creed.
4341,XXVIII,Meantime I give my fancy all it craves;
4342,XXVIII,Like him who found the West when first he caught
4343,XXVIII,"The light that glittered from the world he sought,"
4344,XXVIII,And furled his sails till Dawn should show the land;
4345,XXVIII,While in glad dreams he saw the ambient waves
4346,XXVIII,Go rippling brightly up a golden strand.
4347,XXVIII,
4348,XXVIII,Hath there not been a softer breath at play
4349,XXVIII,In the long woodland aisles than often sweeps
4350,XXVIII,At this rough season through their solemn deeps--
4351,XXVIII,"A gentle Ariel sent by gentle May,"
4352,XXVIII,Who knew it was the morn
4353,XXVIII,"On which a hope was born,"
4354,XXVIII,"To greet the flower e'er it was fully blown,"
4355,XXVIII,And nurse it as some lily of her own?
4356,XXVIII,"And wherefore, save to grace a happy day,"
4357,XXVIII,Did the whole West at blushing sunset glow
4358,XXVIII,"With clouds that, floating up in bridal snow,"
4359,XXVIII,"Passed with the festal eve, rose-crowned, away?"
4360,XXVIII,"And now, if I may trust my straining sight,"
4361,XXVIII,"The heavens appear with added stars to-night,"
4362,XXVIII,"And deeper depths, and more celestial height,"
4363,XXVIII,Than hath been reached except in dreams or death.
4364,XXVIII,"Hush, sweetest South!  I love thy delicate breath;"
4365,XXVIII,But hush! methought I felt an angel's kiss!
4366,XXVIII,Oh! all that lives is happy in my bliss.
4367,XXVIII,"That lonely fir, which always seems"
4368,XXVIII,"As though it locked dark secrets in itself,"
4369,XXVIII,"Hideth a gentle elf,"
4370,XXVIII,Whose wand shall send me soon a frolic troop
4371,XXVIII,"Of rainbow visions, and of moonlit dreams."
4372,XXVIII,"Can joy be weary, that my eyelids droop?"
4373,XXVIII,"To-night I shall not seek my curtained nest,"
4374,XXVIII,But even here find rest.
4375,XXVIII,Who whispered then?  And what are they that peep
4376,XXVIII,Betwixt the foliage in the tree-top there?
4377,XXVIII,"Come, Fairy Shadows! for the morn is near,"
4378,XXVIII,When to your sombre pine ye all must creep;
4379,XXVIII,"Come, ye wild pilots of the darkness, ere"
4380,XXVIII,My spirit sinks into the gulf of Sleep;
4381,XXVIII,Even now it circles round and round the deep--
4382,XXVIII,Appear!  Appear!

4391,XXVIII,"I think that, next to your sweet eyes,"
4392,XXVIII,"And pleasant books, and starry skies,"
4393,XXVIII,I love the world of flowers;
4394,XXVIII,"Less for their beauty of a day,"
4395,XXVIII,"Than for the tender things they say,"
4396,XXVIII,"And for a creed I've held alway,"
4397,XXVIII,That they are sentient powers.
4398,XXVIII,
4399,XXVIII,It may be matter for a smile--
4400,XXVIII,And I laugh secretly the while
4401,XXVIII,I speak the fancy out--
4402,XXVIII,"But that they love, and that they woo,"
4403,XXVIII,"And that they often marry too,"
4404,XXVIII,"And do as noisier creatures do,"
4405,XXVIII,I've not the faintest doubt.
4406,XXVIII,
4407,XXVIII,"And so, I cannot deem it right"
4408,XXVIII,"To take them from the glad sunlight,"
4409,XXVIII,As I have sometimes dared;
4410,XXVIII,Though not without an anxious sigh
4411,XXVIII,"Lest this should break some gentle tie,"
4412,XXVIII,"Some covenant of friendship, I"
4413,XXVIII,Had better far have spared.
4414,XXVIII,
4415,XXVIII,"And when, in wild or thoughtless hours,"
4416,XXVIII,"My hand hath crushed the tiniest flowers,"
4417,XXVIII,I ne'er could shut from sight
4418,XXVIII,"The corpses of the tender things,"
4419,XXVIII,"With other drear imaginings,"
4420,XXVIII,And little angel-flowers with wings
4421,XXVIII,Would haunt me through the night.
4422,XXVIII,
4423,XXVIII,"Oh! say you, friend, the creed is fraught"
4424,XXVIII,"With sad, and even with painful thought,"
4425,XXVIII,Nor could you bear to know
4426,XXVIII,That such capacities belong
4427,XXVIII,"To creatures helpless against wrong,"
4428,XXVIII,At once too weak to fly the strong
4429,XXVIII,Or front the feeblest foe?
4430,XXVIII,
4431,XXVIII,"So be it always, then, with you;"
4432,XXVIII,So be it--whether false or true--
4433,XXVIII,I press my faith on none;
4434,XXVIII,"If other fancies please you more,"
4435,XXVIII,"The flowers shall blossom as before,"
4436,XXVIII,"Dear as the Sibyl-leaves of yore,"
4437,XXVIII,"But senseless, every one."
4438,XXVIII,
4439,XXVIII,"Yet, though I give you no reply,"
4440,XXVIII,It were not hard to justify
4441,XXVIII,My creed to partial ears;
4442,XXVIII,"But, conscious of the cruel part,"
4443,XXVIII,"My rhymes would flow with faltering art,"
4444,XXVIII,"I could not plead against your heart,"
4445,XXVIII,Nor reason with your tears.

4455,XXVIII,"From yon airy powers,"
4456,XXVIII,We have languished for them
4457,XXVIII,"Many sultry hours,"
4458,XXVIII,"And earth is sick and wan, and pines with all her flowers."
4459,XXVIII,
4460,XXVIII,What have they been doing
4461,XXVIII,In the burning June?
4462,XXVIII,Riding with the genii?
4463,XXVIII,Visiting the moon?
4464,XXVIII,Or sleeping on the ice amid an arctic noon?
4465,XXVIII,
4466,XXVIII,Bring they with them jewels
4467,XXVIII,From the sunset lands?
4468,XXVIII,What are these they scatter
4469,XXVIII,With such lavish hands?
4470,XXVIII,There are no brighter gems in Raolconda's sands.
4471,XXVIII,
4472,XXVIII,"Pattering on the gravel,"
4473,XXVIII,"Dropping from the eaves,"

4476,XXVIII,They flash the liquid pearls as flung from fairy sieves.
4477,XXVIII,
4478,XXVIII,"Meanwhile, unreluctant,"
4479,XXVIII,Earth like Danaë lies;
4480,XXVIII,"Listen! is it fancy,"
4481,XXVIII,"That beneath us sighs,"
4482,XXVIII,As that warm lap receives the largesse of the skies?
4483,XXVIII,
4484,XXVIII,"Jove, it is, descendeth"
4485,XXVIII,In those crystal rills;
4486,XXVIII,And this world-wide tremor
4487,XXVIII,Is a pulse that thrills
4488,XXVIII,To a god's life infused through veins of velvet hills.
4489,XXVIII,
4490,XXVIII,"Wait, thou jealous sunshine,"
4491,XXVIII,Break not on their bliss;
4492,XXVIII,Earth will blush in roses
4493,XXVIII,"Many a day for this,"
4494,XXVIII,And bend a brighter brow beneath thy burning kiss.

4502,XXVIII,
4503,XXVIII,She came with April blooms and showers;
4504,XXVIII,We count her little life by flowers.
4505,XXVIII,"As buds the rose upon her cheek,"
4506,XXVIII,We choose a flower for every week.
4507,XXVIII,"A week of hyacinths, we say,"
4508,XXVIII,"And one of heart's-ease, ushered May;"
4509,XXVIII,And then because two wishes met
4510,XXVIII,Upon the rose and violet--
4511,XXVIII,"I liked the Beauty, Kate, the Nun--"
4512,XXVIII,The violet and the rose count one.
4513,XXVIII,A week the apple marked with white;
4514,XXVIII,A week the lily scored in light;
4515,XXVIII,"Red poppies closed May's happy moon,"
4516,XXVIII,And tulips this blue week in June.
4517,XXVIII,Here end as yet the flowery links;
4518,XXVIII,To-day begins the week of pinks;
4519,XXVIII,"But soon--so grave, and deep, and wise"
4520,XXVIII,"The meaning grows in Baby's eyes,"
4521,XXVIII,So VERY deep for Baby's age--

4533,XXVIII,Look! coral-leaved! and--mark these spots
4534,XXVIII,"Red staining red in crimson clots,"
4535,XXVIII,Like a sweet lip bitten through
4536,XXVIII,"In a pique.  There, where that hue"
4537,XXVIII,"Is spilt in drops, some fairy thing"
4538,XXVIII,"Hath gashed the azure of its wing,"
4539,XXVIII,"Or thence, perhaps, this very morn,"
4540,XXVIII,Plucked the splinters of a thorn.
4541,XXVIII,
4542,XXVIII,Rose! I make thy bliss my care!
4543,XXVIII,In my lady's dusky hair
4544,XXVIII,"Thou shalt burn this coming night,"
4545,XXVIII,With even a richer crimson light.
4546,XXVIII,To requite me thou shalt tell--
4547,XXVIII,What I might not say as well--
4548,XXVIII,"How I love her; how, in brief,"
4549,XXVIII,On a certain crimson leaf
4550,XXVIII,"In my bosom, is a debt"
4551,XXVIII,Writ in deeper crimson yet.
4552,XXVIII,If she wonder what it be--
4553,XXVIII,"But she'll guess it, I foresee--"
4554,XXVIII,"Tell her that I date it, pray,"

4568,XXVIII,
4569,XXVIII,"And for the bliss ye brought me then,"
4570,XXVIII,Your faded forms are precious things;
4571,XXVIII,"No flowers so fair, no buds so sweet"
4572,XXVIII,Shall bloom through all my future springs.
4573,XXVIII,
4574,XXVIII,"And so, pale ones! with hands as soft"
4575,XXVIII,"As if I closed a baby's eyes,"

4605,XXVIII,
4606,XXVIII,Take with thee all thy gloom

4655,XXVIII,
4656,XXVIII,"Yet that fond mother praised, the world caressed,"
4657,XXVIII,And ONE adored me--how shall HE who soon
4658,XXVIII,"Shall wear my gentle flower upon his breast,"
4659,XXVIII,Prize to its utmost worth the priceless boon?

4670,XXVIII,
4671,XXVIII,And yet--for well I know that virgin heart--
4672,XXVIII,No wifely duty will she leave undone;
4673,XXVIII,Nor will her love neglect that woman's art
4674,XXVIII,Which courts and keeps a love already won.
4675,XXVIII,
4676,XXVIII,In no light girlish levity she goes
4677,XXVIII,"Unto the altar where they wait her now,"
4678,XXVIII,"But with a thoughtful, prayerful heart that knows"
4679,XXVIII,The solemn purport of a marriage vow.
4680,XXVIII,
4681,XXVIII,"And she will keep, with all her soul's deep truth,"
4682,XXVIII,The lightest pledge which binds her love and life;
4683,XXVIII,And she will be--no less in age than youth
4684,XXVIII,My noble child will be--a noble wife.
4685,XXVIII,
4686,XXVIII,"And he, her lover! husband! what of him?"
4687,XXVIII,"Yes, he will shield, I think, my bud from blight!"

4722,XXVIII,
4723,XXVIII,"Ye winds! keep every storm aloof,"
4724,XXVIII,And kiss away the tears they weep!
4725,XXVIII,"Ye skies, that make their only roof,"

4742,XXVIII,But for a most audacious wish to gauge
4743,XXVIII,The hoarded wisdom of thy learned craw.
4744,XXVIII,
4745,XXVIII,"Art thou, grave bird! so wondrous wise indeed?"
4746,XXVIII,"Speak freely, without fear of jest or gibe--"
4747,XXVIII,What is thy moral and religious creed?
4748,XXVIII,And what the metaphysics of thy tribe?
4749,XXVIII,
4750,XXVIII,"A Poet, curious in birds and brutes,"
4751,XXVIII,I do not question thee in idle play;
4752,XXVIII,What is thy station?  What are thy pursuits?
4753,XXVIII,Doubtless thou hast thy pleasures--what are THEY?
4754,XXVIII,
4755,XXVIII,"Or is 't thy wont to muse and mouse at once,"
4756,XXVIII,"Entice thy prey with airs of meditation,"
4757,XXVIII,"And with the unvarying habits of a dunce,"
4758,XXVIII,To dine in solemn depths of contemplation?
4759,XXVIII,
4760,XXVIII,There may be much--the world at least says so--
4761,XXVIII,Behind that ponderous brow and thoughtful gaze;
4762,XXVIII,"Yet such a great philosopher should know,"
4763,XXVIII,It is by no means wise to think always.
4764,XXVIII,
4765,XXVIII,"And, Bird, despite thy meditative air,"
4766,XXVIII,I hold thy stock of wit but paltry pelf--
4767,XXVIII,"Thou show'st that same grave aspect everywhere,"
4768,XXVIII,"And wouldst look thoughtful, stuffed, upon a shelf."

4774,XXVIII,
4775,XXVIII,So doff th' imposture of those heavy brows;
4776,XXVIII,They do not serve to hide thy instincts base--
4777,XXVIII,"And if thou must be sometimes munching MOUSE,"
4778,XXVIII,"Munch it, O Owl! with less profound a face."

4791,XXVIII,And yet how placid is thy brow!
4792,XXVIII,"It seems to woo the bold caress,"

4795,XXVIII,

4809,XXVIII,"Suppose, for instance, I should clasp"
4810,XXVIII,"Thus,--so,--and thus!--thy slender waist--"
4811,XXVIII,I would not hold within my grasp
4812,XXVIII,More than this loosened zone embraced.
4813,XXVIII,

4921,III,"Notches the slow, strange changes of its growth."
4922,III,Ourselves are our own records; if we looked
4923,III,Rightly into that blotted crimson page
4924,III,"Within our bosoms, then there were no need"
4925,III,To chronicle our stories; for the heart
4926,III,"Hath, like the earth, its strata, and contains"
4927,III,"Its past within its present.  Well for us,"
4928,III,"And our most cherished secrets, that within"
4929,III,The round of being few there are who read
4930,III,"Beneath the surface.  Else our very forms,"
4931,III,"The merest gesture of our hands, might tell"

4933,III,"Those eyes, in whose dark heaven I have gazed"
4934,III,"More curiously than on my favorite stars,"
4935,III,"Are deeper for such griefs as they have seen,"
4936,III,"And brighter for the fancies they have shrined,"

4949,III,Made me all rich with the dear name of friend.

4975,III,
4976,III,Oh! blessings on the quiet hour!
4977,III,My thoughts in calmer current flow;
4978,III,"She is not conscious of her power,"
4979,III,And hath no knowledge of my woe.
4980,III,"Perhaps, if like yon peaceful star,"
4981,III,"She looked upon my burning brow,"
4982,III,"She would not pity from afar,"
4983,III,But kiss me as the breeze does now.

4997,III,Along its dear and sacred text
4998,III,No other eyes than thine have passed--
4999,III,Be mine the eyes that trace it next!
5000,III,
5001,III,"Oh! very nobly is it wrought,--"
5002,III,"This web of love's divinest light,--"
5003,III,"But not to feed my soul with thought,"
5004,III,Hang I upon the book to-night;
5005,III,"I read it only for thy sake,"
5006,III,To every page my lips I press--
5007,III,The very leaves appear to make
5008,III,A silken rustle like thy dress.
5009,III,
5010,III,"And so, as each blest page I turn,"
5011,III,"I seem, with many a secret thrill,"
5012,III,"To touch a soft white hand, and burn"
5013,III,To clasp and kiss it at my will.
5014,III,"Oh! if a fancy be so sweet,"
5015,III,These shadowy fingers touching mine--
5016,III,"How wildly would my pulses beat,"

5041,III,Bring with thee from thy Polar cave

5044,III,And the dread avalanche of snow!
5045,III,

5050,III,
5051,III,Blend in thy mighty voice whate'er
5052,III,"Of danger, terror, and despair"
5053,III,Thou hast encountered in thy sweep
5054,III,Across the land and o'er the deep.
5055,III,
5056,III,"Pour in our ears all notes of woe,"
5057,III,"That, as these very moments flow,"

5077,III,"The soul, if it would burn with starlike power,"

5084,III,"Nor praise, nor blame shall reach us, save what love"
5085,III,Of knowledge for itself shall wake at times
5086,III,In our own bosoms; come! and we will build
5087,III,"A wall of quiet thought, and gentle books,"

5089,III,Sometimes--for we need not be anchorites--
5090,III,"A distant friend shall cheer us through the Post,"
5091,III,Or some Gazette--of course no partisan--
5092,III,Shall bring us pleasant news of pleasant things;
5093,III,"Then, twisted into graceful allumettes,"
5094,III,Each ancient joke shall blaze with genuine flame
5095,III,"To light our pipes and candles; but to wars,"
5096,III,"Whether of words or weapons, we shall be"
5097,III,Deaf--so we twain shall pass away the time

5099,III,"Alone, within some quiet garden-nook,"
5100,III,"With a clear night of stars above their heads,"

5213,V,From Sachem's Head to Sumter's wall
5214,V,"Resounds the voice of hut and hall,"
5215,V,Carolina!
5216,V,"No! thou hast not a stain, they say,"
5217,V,Or none save what the battle-day
5218,V,"Shall wash in seas of blood away,"
5219,V,Carolina!
5220,V,"Thy skirts indeed the foe may part,"
5221,V,"Thy robe be pierced with sword and dart,"
5222,V,"They shall not touch thy noble heart,"
5223,V,Carolina!
5224,V,
5225,VI,VI
5226,VI,
5227,VI,Ere thou shalt own the tyrant's thrall
5228,VI,Ten times ten thousand men must fall;
5229,VI,"Thy corpse may hearken to his call,"
5230,VI,Carolina!
5231,VI,"When, by thy bier, in mournful throngs"
5232,VI,"The women chant thy mortal wrongs,"
5233,VI,"'T will be their own funereal songs,"
5234,VI,Carolina!
5235,VI,From thy dead breast by ruffians trod
5236,VI,No helpless child shall look to God;
5237,VI,"All shall be safe beneath thy sod,"
5238,VI,Carolina!
5239,VI,
5240,VII,VII
5241,VII,
5242,VII,"Girt with such wills to do and bear,"
5243,VII,"Assured in right, and mailed in prayer,"
5244,VII,"Thou wilt not bow thee to despair,"
5245,VII,Carolina!
5246,VII,Throw thy bold banner to the breeze!
5247,VII,Front with thy ranks the threatening seas
5248,VII,"Like thine own proud armorial trees,"
5249,VII,Carolina!
5250,VII,"Fling down thy gauntlet to the Huns,"
5251,VII,And roar the challenge from thy guns;
5252,VII,"Then leave the future to thy sons,"

5262,VII,Ho! woodsmen of the mountain side!
5263,VII,Ho! dwellers in the vales!
5264,VII,Ho! ye who by the chafing tide
5265,VII,Have roughened in the gales!
5266,VII,"Leave barn and byre, leave kin and cot,"
5267,VII,Lay by the bloodless spade;
5268,VII,"Let desk, and case, and counter rot,"
5269,VII,And burn your books of trade.
5270,VII,
5271,VII,The despot roves your fairest lands;
5272,VII,"And till he flies or fears,"
5273,VII,"Your fields must grow but armèd bands,"
5274,VII,Your sheaves be sheaves of spears!
5275,VII,Give up to mildew and to rust
5276,VII,The useless tools of gain;
5277,VII,And feed your country's sacred dust
5278,VII,With floods of crimson rain!
5279,VII,
5280,VII,"Come, with the weapons at your call--"
5281,VII,"With musket, pike, or knife;"
5282,VII,He wields the deadliest blade of all
5283,VII,Who lightest holds his life.
5284,VII,The arm that drives its unbought blows
5285,VII,"With all a patriot's scorn,"
5286,VII,"Might brain a tyrant with a rose,"
5287,VII,Or stab him with a thorn.
5288,VII,
5289,VII,Does any falter? let him turn
5290,VII,"To some brave maiden's eyes,"
5291,VII,And catch the holy fires that burn
5292,VII,In those sublunar skies.
5293,VII,"Oh! could you like your women feel,"
5294,VII,"And in their spirit march,"
5295,VII,A day might see your lines of steel
5296,VII,Beneath the victor's arch.
5297,VII,
5298,VII,"What hope, O God! would not grow warm"
5299,VII,When thoughts like these give cheer?
5300,VII,"The Lily calmly braves the storm,"
5301,VII,And shall the Palm-tree fear?
5302,VII,No! rather let its branches court
5303,VII,The rack that sweeps the plain;
5304,VII,And from the Lily's regal port
5305,VII,Learn how to breast the strain!
5306,VII,
5307,VII,Ho! woodsmen of the mountain side!
5308,VII,Ho! dwellers in the vales!
5309,VII,Ho! ye who by the roaring tide
5310,VII,Have roughened in the gales!
5311,VII,"Come! flocking gayly to the fight,"
5312,VII,"From forest, hill, and lake;"
5313,VII,"We battle for our Country's right,"
5314,VII,And for the Lily's sake!

5324,VII,"The first fall of the snow,"
5325,VII,"In the broad sunlight of heroic deeds,"
5326,VII,The City bides the foe.
5327,VII,
5328,VII,"As yet, behind their ramparts stern and proud,"
5329,VII,Her bolted thunders sleep--
5330,VII,"Dark Sumter, like a battlemented cloud,"
5331,VII,Looms o'er the solemn deep.
5332,VII,
5333,VII,No Calpe frowns from lofty cliff or scar
5334,VII,To guard the holy strand;
5335,VII,But Moultrie holds in leash her dogs of war
5336,VII,Above the level sand.
5337,VII,
5338,VII,"And down the dunes a thousand guns lie couched,"
5339,VII,"Unseen, beside the flood--"
5340,VII,Like tigers in some Orient jungle crouched
5341,VII,That wait and watch for blood.
5342,VII,
5343,VII,"Meanwhile, through streets still echoing with trade,"
5344,VII,"Walk grave and thoughtful men,"
5345,VII,Whose hands may one day wield the patriot's blade
5346,VII,As lightly as the pen.
5347,VII,
5348,VII,"And maidens, with such eyes as would grow dim"
5349,VII,"Over a bleeding hound,"
5350,VII,Seem each one to have caught the strength of him
5351,VII,Whose sword she sadly bound.
5352,VII,
5353,VII,"Thus girt without and garrisoned at home,"
5354,VII,"Day patient following day,"
5355,VII,"Old Charleston looks from roof, and spire, and dome,"
5356,VII,Across her tranquil bay.
5357,VII,
5358,VII,"Ships, through a hundred foes, from Saxon lands"
5359,VII,"And spicy Indian ports,"
5360,VII,"Bring Saxon steel and iron to her hands,"
5361,VII,And Summer to her courts.
5362,VII,
5363,VII,"But still, along yon dim Atlantic line,"
5364,VII,The only hostile smoke
5365,VII,"Creeps like a harmless mist above the brine,"
5366,VII,"From some frail, floating oak."
5367,VII,
5368,VII,"Shall the Spring dawn, and she still clad in smiles,"
5369,VII,"And with an unscathed brow,"
5370,VII,"Rest in the strong arms of her palm-crowned isles,"
5371,VII,As fair and free as now?
5372,VII,
5373,VII,We know not; in the temple of the Fates
5374,VII,God has inscribed her doom;
5375,VII,"And, all untroubled in her faith, she waits"
5376,VII,The triumph or the tomb.

5387,VII,Fall where he won his fame beneath the sky
5388,VII,Of tropic Vera Cruz;
5389,VII,
5390,VII,Bold scorner of the cant that has its birth
5391,VII,In feeble or in failing powers;
5392,VII,A lover of all frank and genial mirth
5393,VII,That wreathes the sword with flowers;
5394,VII,
5395,VII,"He moves amid the warriors of the day,"
5396,VII,Just such a soldier as the art
5397,VII,That builds its trophies upon human clay
5398,VII,Moulds of a cheerful heart.
5399,VII,
5400,VII,"I see him in the battle that shall shake,"
5401,VII,"Ere long, old Sumter's haughty crown,"
5402,VII,And from their dreams of peaceful traffic wake
5403,VII,The wharves of yonder town;
5404,VII,
5405,VII,"As calm as one would greet a pleasant guest,"
5406,VII,"And quaff a cup to love and life,"
5407,VII,"He hurls his deadliest thunders with a jest,"
5408,VII,And laughs amid the strife.
5409,VII,
5410,VII,Yet not the gravest soldier of them all
5411,VII,Surveys a field with broader scope;
5412,VII,And who behind that sea-encircled wall
5413,VII,Fights with a loftier hope?
5414,VII,
5415,VII,Gay Chieftain! on the crimson rolls of Fame
5416,VII,Thy deeds are written with the sword;
5417,VII,"But there are gentler thoughts which, with thy name,"
5418,VII,Thy country's page shall hoard.
5419,VII,
5420,VII,A nature of that rare and happy cast
5421,VII,"Which looks, unsteeled, on murder's face;"
5422,VII,"Through what dark scenes of bloodshed hast thou passed,"
5423,VII,Yet lost no social grace?
5424,VII,
5425,VII,"So, when the bard depicts thee, thou shalt wield"
5426,VII,"The weapon of a tyrant's doom,"
5427,VII,"Round which, inscribed with many a well-fought field,"
5428,VII,The rose of joy shall bloom.

5553,IV,"When all shall own it, but the type"
5554,IV,Whereby we shall be known in every land
5555,IV,"Is that vast gulf which lips our Southern strand,"
5556,IV,"And through the cold, untempered ocean pours"
5557,IV,"Its genial streams, that far off Arctic shores"

5597,IV,
5598,IV,They came with many a haughty boast;

5600,IV,They darkened half the neighboring seas;
5601,IV,And swooped like vultures on the coast.
5602,IV,
5603,IV,"False recreants in all knightly strife,"

5607,IV,
5608,IV,"They fought as tyrants fight, or slaves;"

5611,IV,Or mouldering slow in shallow graves.
5612,IV,
5613,IV,What though we hear about our path
5614,IV,The heavens with howls of vengeance rent?
5615,IV,The venom of their hate is spent;
5616,IV,We need not heed their fangless wrath.
5617,IV,

5645,IV,Upon the coffin of the dead.
5646,IV,"Beyond my streaming window-pane,"

5702,IV,"Goes, glory laden, from the strand."

6290,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,
6291,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,"Oh, foolish hope! those mystic gleams"

6315,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,
6316,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,Perhaps in this the pleasure lies--
6317,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,I read my thoughts within thine eyes.
6318,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,
6319,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,And so dare fancy that my art
6320,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,May sink as deeply as thy heart.

6322,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,Perhaps I love to make my words
6323,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,"Sing round thee like so many birds,"
6324,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,

6417,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,"You took them with a happy smile,"
6418,POEMS NOW FIRST COLLECTED,"And nursed them for a little while,"
