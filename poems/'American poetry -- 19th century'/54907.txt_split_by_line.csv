175,THE WHITE SAIL.,"HIGH on the lone and wave-scarred porphyry,"

177,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Past evenfall, sat he whose reverend hair"
178,THE WHITE SAIL.,Down-glittered with the breaker’s volleying foam
179,THE WHITE SAIL.,Visioned before him in the level dark:
180,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Ægeus, of wronged Pandion heir, and king."
181,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And round about his knees, and at his feet,"
182,THE WHITE SAIL.,"In saffrons and sad greens alone bedight,"
183,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Sat, clustered in dim wayward sidelong groups"
184,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Sheer to the ocean’s edge, those liegemen fond"
185,THE WHITE SAIL.,Who with him wished and wept. As thro’ the hours
186,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Of ebbing autumn, on a northward hill,"
187,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Lies summer’s russet ruined panoply,"
188,THE WHITE SAIL.,Knotted and heaped by the fantastic winds
189,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Hap-hazard, while the first adventuring snow"
190,THE WHITE SAIL.,Globes itself on the summit; so they clung
191,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Secure among the rangèd crevices,"
192,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Month after month, and wakeful night on night"
193,THE WHITE SAIL.,Vigilant; ever neighbored and o’ertopped
194,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With that white presence, and the boding sky."
195,THE WHITE SAIL.,
196,THE WHITE SAIL.,And Ægeus prayed: ‘O give me back but him!

199,THE WHITE SAIL.,Swaying suavely down cool garden-paths

201,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With bronze and tangly curls a-toss, to show"
202,THE WHITE SAIL.,Infancy’s golden-silken underglow;
203,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The glad eye dusking blue, as is the sea"
204,THE WHITE SAIL.,Ere fiery sunset tricks it; and the lashes
205,THE WHITE SAIL.,"In one close sombre file against his cheek,"
206,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Enphalanxed in perpetual trail and droop,"
207,THE WHITE SAIL.,Wherethro’ gleams laughter as thro’ sorrow’s pale.
208,THE WHITE SAIL.,And anger’s self doth tremble maidenly;
209,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The massy throat; the nostril mobile, smooth;"
210,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The breast full-orbed with arduous large pride,"
211,THE WHITE SAIL.,"As I so oft have marked, when from the chase,"
212,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The witness-dropping knife swung with the bow,"
213,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Heading the burdened company, he came,"
214,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Aye vermeil with the wholesome wind, outwrestler"
215,THE WHITE SAIL.,Of storms and perils all. High-mettled Theseus!
216,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Keystone of greatness, bond of expectation,"
217,THE WHITE SAIL.,Stay of this realm! in his strong-sinewed beauty
218,THE WHITE SAIL.,Dear unto men as Tanais bright-sanded
219,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Whose flood harmonious lapses on the ear,"
220,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And makes for hearts yoke-wearied, thither roaming,"
221,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Thrice feastful holiday. Ah, righteous gods!"
222,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Forasmuch as I love him and await him,"
223,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Who from my youth have been your servitor,"
224,THE WHITE SAIL.,Yield my old age its boon of vindication:
225,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Haven the happy ship here, ere I die.’"
226,THE WHITE SAIL.,
227,THE WHITE SAIL.,Still heedlessly the hushed moon bent her bow
228,THE WHITE SAIL.,Over the unshorn forest oakenry
229,THE WHITE SAIL.,And the dense gladiate leaves of Thoræ’s pine:
230,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The cold and incommunicable moon,"
231,THE WHITE SAIL.,Waxing and waning thro’ the barren time
232,THE WHITE SAIL.,"That brought not Theseus’ self, nor of him sign,"
233,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Nor any waif of rumor out of Crete,"
234,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Whereto, a year nigh gone, the ship had sped"
235,THE WHITE SAIL.,Forlorn; her decks enshrouded in plucked yew
236,THE WHITE SAIL.,Strewn to the mizzen; and her oary props
237,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And halyards all with blossomed myrtle twined,"
238,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And every sail dark as from looms of hell,"
239,THE WHITE SAIL.,In token of the universal dole.
240,THE WHITE SAIL.,And on her heavèd anchor and spurred keel
241,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Cheers none, but protest, moans, and ire attended,"
242,THE WHITE SAIL.,"When from the quay, in melancholy weather"
243,THE WHITE SAIL.,Forward she sobbed on black unwilling wing.
244,THE WHITE SAIL.,
245,THE WHITE SAIL.,"But ere that going drear, one foot ashore,"
246,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Theseus with his mild comrades hand in hand,--"
247,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The seven maids and boys to bondage sealed,"
248,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Lifted his head, and met his father’s eyes,"
249,THE WHITE SAIL.,And out of morning ardor made this oath:
250,THE WHITE SAIL.,"‘My people, stand not for our sakes in tears!"
251,THE WHITE SAIL.,No shape of ill shall daunt me; I will strike
252,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And overcome, Heaven’s favor for my shield."
253,THE WHITE SAIL.,And when engirt with conquest I return
254,THE WHITE SAIL.,"(Or never else hies Theseus hitherward),"
255,THE WHITE SAIL.,"That ye may read my heart while yet at sea,"
256,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And know indeed that fate hath used me fair,"
257,THE WHITE SAIL.,"That these your lambs I shepherd and lead home,"
258,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Lo, I will set upon the central mast"
259,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The sky-sail white! white to the hollowing breeze,"
260,THE WHITE SAIL.,"White to that fierce and alien coast, and white"
261,THE WHITE SAIL.,"To your espial, from the horizon’s brink"
262,THE WHITE SAIL.,Unto the moored fulfilment of your joy.
263,THE WHITE SAIL.,Watch: you that keep your faith and love in me.’
264,THE WHITE SAIL.,
265,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And they believed and watched, albeit with dread,"
266,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Steadfastly without plaint, to soothe the king,"
267,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Who, taciturn and close-engarmented,"
268,THE WHITE SAIL.,From his nocturnal towered station leaned
269,THE WHITE SAIL.,Pining against the unresponsive tide.
270,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And thro’ his brain, with hum processional,"
271,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Wheeled memories of Theseus, deeds of Theseus,"
272,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The race he won of yore, the song he sang;"
273,THE WHITE SAIL.,"His truth, his eloquence, his April moods,"
274,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And all his championship of trodden tribes,"
275,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Since first he lit on Athens, like a star."
276,THE WHITE SAIL.,
277,THE WHITE SAIL.,"For Ægeus, to the low-voiced Meta wed,"
278,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Thereafter to Rhexenor’s daughter spouse,"
279,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Childless, and by his brethren’s guile deposed,"
280,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Led by a last mysterious oracle,"
281,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Once, exiled, to Trœzene wandered down;"
282,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And there, accorded Aphrodite’s grace,"
283,THE WHITE SAIL.,"To whom the sacrificial smoke he raised,"
284,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Atonement and conciliation sweet,"
285,THE WHITE SAIL.,Begot to Greece her hero; and straightway
286,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Bereavèd Æthra, of old Pelops’ race"
287,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Forsook, by destined rumor summoned home."
288,THE WHITE SAIL.,"But with the auroral kiss of parting, he"
289,THE WHITE SAIL.,"In the spring sunshine, on the mellow shore"
290,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Laid his huge blade beneath a caverned rock,"
291,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And both the jewelled sandals from his feet,"
292,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With lofty exhortation: ‘Bid my son,"
293,THE WHITE SAIL.,"When he, with strength inherited of mine"
294,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Can heave this boulder, take the sword and shoon,"
295,THE WHITE SAIL.,And claim in Athens me his sire. Farewell!’
296,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And Æthra bided, dreaming, at the court,"
297,THE WHITE SAIL.,Till from her knee laughed back her own blue eyes.
298,THE WHITE SAIL.,
299,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And the young boy, loosed in sun-dappled groves,"
300,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Defiant, chased the droning harvest-fly,"
301,THE WHITE SAIL.,Or nicked pomegranates with his ruddy thumb
302,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Ripe from the bough; nor would his mother chide,"
303,THE WHITE SAIL.,"But with strange awe hang o’er him worshipping,"
304,THE WHITE SAIL.,As one that turns with passionate-praying lips
305,THE WHITE SAIL.,East to the Delian shrine he shall not see:
306,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Save once, when he a turtle-pigeon pent"
307,THE WHITE SAIL.,"In wicker-work of some swart soldier’s skill,"
308,THE WHITE SAIL.,With lisping promise aye to nourish it;
309,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And stroked his plaining bird for one long day,"
310,THE WHITE SAIL.,"But on the morrow ceased his fostering,"
311,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And left his captive caged, the tiny gourd"
312,THE WHITE SAIL.,Of water unreplenished. Then the child
313,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Bewailed his darling, lying stiff and mute;"
314,THE WHITE SAIL.,And Æthra held his innocent hand in hers
315,THE WHITE SAIL.,With solemn lessoning; for she foresaw
316,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Remorse, and irremediable ache,"
317,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And ruin, following him whose manhood swerves"
318,THE WHITE SAIL.,To the eased byways of forgetfulness.
319,THE WHITE SAIL.,"She, his hot brows caressing, so besought"
320,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The weeping prince: ‘If thou, O little son!"
321,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Wilt lay hereafter duties on thyself,"
322,THE WHITE SAIL.,Stand mindful of them; all thy vows observe.
323,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Be a trust broken but a small, small thing,"
324,THE WHITE SAIL.,Its possible shadow slaves this world in woe.’
325,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And ere the dial veered, did Æthra speak"
326,THE WHITE SAIL.,"His vanished father’s name and gave the charge,"
327,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And led him to the rock, and in him fired"
328,THE WHITE SAIL.,The aspirations of his godlike race.
329,THE WHITE SAIL.,
330,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Lost quite to former pastimes, thenceforth he"
331,THE WHITE SAIL.,Brooded on her sweet chronicle; and oft
332,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Burst thro’ arcades and vaporous aisles of dawn,"
333,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And stood, flushed in the rubious dimpling light,"
334,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Straining his thews at sunrise, to cajole"
335,THE WHITE SAIL.,The granite treasurer of those tokens twain:
336,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With his young heel intrenched in faithless sand,"
337,THE WHITE SAIL.,"His cloud of yellow hair hanging before,"
338,THE WHITE SAIL.,Tugged at the flint; or pressed his forward knee
339,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With obdurate sieges, into its hard side;"
340,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Anon, with restful rosy stretch of limb,"
341,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Plunged to the onset, hound-like, on all fours,"
342,THE WHITE SAIL.,Beating a moated way about that place
343,THE WHITE SAIL.,Where the grim guardian held a fixèd foot;
344,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And ever, noon on noon, with petulant tears,"
345,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Stole back, o’ervanquished, to his quiet nooks."
346,THE WHITE SAIL.,"There would he woo his mother’s frequent tale,"
347,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And urge her gentle prophecy, that he"
348,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The kinsman of great Herakles, should too"
349,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Rise, mighty, and o’er earth’s fell odds prevail."
350,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Wherefore, at waking-time, he plucked up heart"
351,THE WHITE SAIL.,"To wrestle with the pitiless rock anew,"
352,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Season on season, patient. And behold,"
353,THE WHITE SAIL.,When the tenth summer’s delicate keen dews
354,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Died from his shoreward path, at last befell"
355,THE WHITE SAIL.,"One sure petrean tremor, one weird shock"
356,THE WHITE SAIL.,"At his tense vigor; and ere twilight failed,"
357,THE WHITE SAIL.,Clean to the sea’s verge rolled that doughty bulk!
358,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And Theseus, in his full inheritance,"
359,THE WHITE SAIL.,"In the superb meridian of his youth,"
360,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Sandalled, the great hilt hard against his breast,"
361,THE WHITE SAIL.,Climbed to his mother’s bower. Æthra laid
362,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Her lips to his warm cygnet neck, and swooned,"
363,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Thereby apprised the destined hour had come,"
364,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And having sped her boy upon his quest,"
365,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Drooped, like a sun-void lily, and so died."
366,THE WHITE SAIL.,
367,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Then radiant Theseus, journeying overland,"
368,THE WHITE SAIL.,All robber-plagues infesting those still glens
369,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Physicianed, and redeemed all realms distressed."
370,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Phæa, prodigious Crommyonian shape,"
371,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Apt Cercyon of Arcadia, he slew;"
372,THE WHITE SAIL.,And of his dominant valor overcame
373,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The smith-god’s son, who with the mortal mace"
374,THE WHITE SAIL.,Beleaguered travellers in Epidaur;
375,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Unburied martyrs fitly to avenge,"
376,THE WHITE SAIL.,He harsh Procrustes bedded; limb from limb
377,THE WHITE SAIL.,Rent the Pine-bender on recoiling boughs;
378,THE WHITE SAIL.,And him that thrust the lavers of his feet
379,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Headlong in chasms, Theseus likewise served"
380,THE WHITE SAIL.,By dint of hospitable precedent;
381,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Wide Marathonia’s lordly bull he led,"
382,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Engarlanded with hyacinth and rose,"
383,THE WHITE SAIL.,To the knife’s edge at bland Apollo’s shrine;
384,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Last, guided to a grove sabbatical,"
385,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Knelt to the chanting white Phytalidæ,"
386,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And in their midst was chrismed, and purified"
387,THE WHITE SAIL.,From all the bloodshed of his troublous path.
388,THE WHITE SAIL.,
389,THE WHITE SAIL.,"On to the gate of Athens Theseus strode,"
390,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Docile to Æthra’s warning, that unnamed,"
391,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And with strict privacy, he should seek his sire;"
392,THE WHITE SAIL.,For fifty jealous sons of Pallas held
393,THE WHITE SAIL.,The city’s sovereignty; and overruled
394,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Their father’s childless brother, Ægeus old:"
395,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The agile, able, proud Pallantidæ,"
396,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Whose wrath would rise against the tardy heir,"
397,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Tumultuous, and encompass Greece in war."
398,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Therefore, unheralded, with wary step,"
399,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Chancing upon an open banquet-hall,"
400,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Preceded of his fame, came brave-arrayed"
401,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The stranger hero, but erewhile a boy;"
402,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And straight, along the heaped board glancing down,"
403,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Evil Medea, on her harmful track"
404,THE WHITE SAIL.,"From Corinth unto Colchis, intercepted."
405,THE WHITE SAIL.,
406,THE WHITE SAIL.,"This was Medea of the Fleecemen, late"
407,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Her tender brother’s slayer, whose vile spells"
408,THE WHITE SAIL.,Had promised Ægeus princes of his blood.
409,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Stole from him, at the beck of that mock moon,"
410,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Honor, the flood august of all his life:"
411,THE WHITE SAIL.,"For he, distrustful of the oracles,"
412,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Inasmuch as Trœzene flowered no hope,"
413,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Now in the season of his utmost need,"
414,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Subservient to the sorceress and her whims,"
415,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Blasphemed, in slackened faith, and clave to her;"
416,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And strangling conscience, made his thraldom fine"
417,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With golden incident and public pomp,"
418,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Holding by night most sumptuous festival,"
419,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Feasting beside her, restless and unthroned."
420,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Now Theseus knew that wily woman’s face,"
421,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Who, reading her arraignment in his eyes,"
422,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Shrank close to Ægeus, voluble with fear,"
423,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And urged within his palm a carven bowl,"
424,THE WHITE SAIL.,That he should bid the young wayfarer drain
425,THE WHITE SAIL.,Health to Medea! in one envenomed draught:
426,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Which Theseus heard, alert, past harp and bell,"
427,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Past intervening hubbub of rich mirth,"
428,THE WHITE SAIL.,And sprang to cower the temptress with a word.
429,THE WHITE SAIL.,"But at the instant, sprang her minions too,"
430,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And riot and upbraidings dire began,"
431,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Conflict, and scorn, and drunken challenging."
432,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Then leaped quicksilvered Theseus thro’ the fray,"
433,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With love’s suspicion kindling in his veins,"
434,THE WHITE SAIL.,And gained that space before the startled host
435,THE WHITE SAIL.,Whence from her couch Medea shrieked away:
436,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Limned beautiful and clear from front to feet,"
437,THE WHITE SAIL.,Shod with the shoon Ægean; and his arm
438,THE WHITE SAIL.,Sabred with the one sword that Ægeus knew!
439,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Who, blanching ’neath roused memory’s ebb and flow,"
440,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Among the wrangling merry-makers all,"
441,THE WHITE SAIL.,Clarioned ‘My own!’ and strained him to his breast.
442,THE WHITE SAIL.,
443,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Theseus, in those fresh days of his return,"
444,THE WHITE SAIL.,Tarried not idle; but with warlike haste
445,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Bore down on the usurping lords of state,"
446,THE WHITE SAIL.,Juniors and kin of his discrownèd sire;
447,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Them, ere the morrow dwindled, he beheld"
448,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Scattered as chaff from off the threshing-floor,"
449,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And Ægeus, o’er the wreckage of their reign"
450,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Exalted, with calm brows indiademed."
451,THE WHITE SAIL.,Then was the sacred and sequestered prime
452,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Of liberation, benison, and peace;"
453,THE WHITE SAIL.,"When the round heaven, in summer’s ministrance"
454,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Rolled on its choral axle; till, at end"
455,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Like to a cloudlet that assails the blue,"
456,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Comely and yet with rains ingerminate,"
457,THE WHITE SAIL.,Minos the Cretan unto Athens sent
458,THE WHITE SAIL.,"His nimble princeling. In a fortnight’s span,"
459,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The island lad, competing in the games,"
460,THE WHITE SAIL.,Won fairly; whereupon the envious mob
461,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Made rude revolt, and took upon itself"
462,THE WHITE SAIL.,The barbarous dishonor of his death.
463,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And vengeful Minos sailed, and razed the town,"
464,THE WHITE SAIL.,Laying the bitter forfeit in this wise:
465,THE WHITE SAIL.,‘Athens shall yearly proffer unto me
466,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Her virgin tribute of patrician seed,"
467,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Seven youths, and maidens seven, as by lot,"
468,THE WHITE SAIL.,Wherewith to feed the ravenous Minotaur.’
469,THE WHITE SAIL.,Athens the peerless bowed her ashen head.
470,THE WHITE SAIL.,
471,THE WHITE SAIL.,"So dragged the dreadful twelvemonth thro’ the realm,"
472,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Aye of its dearest blood depopulate,"
473,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And losing grasp on life. The fourth weak year,"
474,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Youngest of all departed, full thirteen"
475,THE WHITE SAIL.,Faltered aboard the deck calamitous;
476,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And with them Theseus, best-belovèd Theseus,"
477,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The king’s sole-born, whom last the doom befell."
478,THE WHITE SAIL.,But as no sister-galley e’er set out
479,THE WHITE SAIL.,"To dolorous ports predestined, in due lapse"
480,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Returning with her steersman, went this ship,"
481,THE WHITE SAIL.,Not hopeless; now her bravest made his vaunt
482,THE WHITE SAIL.,"To thread the maze Dædalian, and destroy"
483,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The pampered monster, holding harm at bay"
484,THE WHITE SAIL.,From the frail flock of Athens; and to flash
485,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Homeward, to chime of oar-compellèd waves,"
486,THE WHITE SAIL.,Signalling with the white exultant sail!
487,THE WHITE SAIL.,"‘So that I live, this thing,’ he said, ‘is sworn:"
488,THE WHITE SAIL.,Watch! you that keep your faith and love in me.’
489,THE WHITE SAIL.,
490,THE WHITE SAIL.,Such tales of Theseus’ youth his father’s mind
491,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Rehearsed, while at his vigil in the night,"
492,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Deep pondering on each noble circumstance,"
493,THE WHITE SAIL.,"As a man shifteth, thro’ an idle hour,"
494,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Anon with hand in light, anon in shade,"
495,THE WHITE SAIL.,The lustres of his one memorial gem.
496,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And oft the king, with a foreboding throe"
497,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Called, urging eld’s unserviceable sight:"
498,THE WHITE SAIL.,‘Shines the white sail yet?’ Spake the murmurous ring:
499,THE WHITE SAIL.,‘Nay; but fantastic clouds low-wandering on.’
500,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Then the fond voice of Ægeus, askingly:"
501,THE WHITE SAIL.,‘Alcamenes! yield my sad heart a song.’
502,THE WHITE SAIL.,
503,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Rose kind Alcamenes, who from his birth"
504,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The king had cherished, from a mossy seat,"
505,THE WHITE SAIL.,The anxious faces turned his happy way;
506,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And with his pose quiescent, lyre in arm,"
507,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Breathed forth a simple ditty, sweet-sustained"
508,THE WHITE SAIL.,Against the diapason of the sea.
509,THE WHITE SAIL.,
510,THE WHITE SAIL.,"‘Thy voice is like the moon, revealed by stealthy paces,"
511,THE WHITE SAIL.,Thy silver-margined voice like the ample moon and free:
512,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Ah, beautiful! ah, mighty! the stars fall on their faces,"
513,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The warring world is silent, for love and awe of thee."
514,THE WHITE SAIL.,
515,THE WHITE SAIL.,"‘My soul is but a sailor, to whom thy wonder-singing"
516,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Is anchorage, and haven, and unimagined day!"
517,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And who, in angry ocean, to thine enchantment clinging,"
518,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Forgets the helm for rapture, and drifts to doom away.’"
519,THE WHITE SAIL.,
520,THE WHITE SAIL.,"But the king hid his brow in both wan hands,"
521,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Sighing: ‘That song at her beguiling feet,"
522,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Out of my brief enslavement, did I make"
523,THE WHITE SAIL.,The year that Theseus on our revels stole.
524,THE WHITE SAIL.,It sears me like a brand with fires o’erpast:
525,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Be silent, my Alcamenes! spare it me."
526,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Thou rather, Theron, sing! Engird my pain"
527,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With some thrice-gallant catch, some madrigal"
528,THE WHITE SAIL.,"That sets the dull blood dancing.’ Theron smiled,"
529,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Masking suspense (for he was Theseus’ friend),"
530,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Half-prone beneath his damask cloak, with chin"
531,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Hand-propped; and fixed his dark eyes on the king,"
532,THE WHITE SAIL.,In trolling of an agitated lay.
533,THE WHITE SAIL.,
534,THE WHITE SAIL.,"‘I drowse in the grass, to the crickets’ elfin strings,"
535,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With boughs and the sun about, with bowl and book,"
536,THE WHITE SAIL.,"At the flood-tide of my youth, in the pearl of springs,"
537,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Cydippe’s hand in my hair.... Ah, horrible thrill!"
538,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Once I was rash, once I was wrong. Quick, look,"
539,THE WHITE SAIL.,"My heart! in thy tremor, over the herded hill,"
540,THE WHITE SAIL.,"In clefts of the moss, in swirls of the sliding brook:"
541,THE WHITE SAIL.,Somewhere the Vengeance lurks to defile and kill!
542,THE WHITE SAIL.,"My arrow back to me somewhere hisses and sings,"
543,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Aye, justly; aye, bitterly, justly. Steady, heart! there."
544,THE WHITE SAIL.,"See, I laugh as I lie: on the brink of the jar yet clings"
545,THE WHITE SAIL.,Sweet foam; and I kiss Cydippe’s hand thro’ my hair.’
546,THE WHITE SAIL.,
547,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Again, with swift uneasy gesturing"
548,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Turned Ægeus, chiding, and protested ere"
549,THE WHITE SAIL.,The whipped-up courage of that roundel’s close:
550,THE WHITE SAIL.,"‘Cease, Theron! this is but an ominous song,"
551,THE WHITE SAIL.,A song of retribution.’ For he thought:
552,THE WHITE SAIL.,‘So retribution dogs my bruisèd age;
553,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Still, still Medea’s soft and deadly name"
554,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Stings all the leafy splendor of my life,"
555,THE WHITE SAIL.,And daunts the morrow’s bud. And if there be
556,THE WHITE SAIL.,"A reckoning I must pay for follies past,"
557,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Must it be--O not that, not now, not here!’"
558,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And drawing to his height, he cried: ‘The sail?"
559,THE WHITE SAIL.,Comes the sail from the south?’ They chorused ‘Naught
560,THE WHITE SAIL.,Save argent flutterings of the shoreward gull.’
561,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And Ægeus, craving solace, urged once more:"
562,THE WHITE SAIL.,"‘Rhodalus! sing thou what shall heal my soul,"
563,THE WHITE SAIL.,In numbers honey-clear.’ Now Rhodalus
564,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The poet, too, was loyal sentinel;"
565,THE WHITE SAIL.,"A fiery patriot, wont to domineer"
566,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The moods of Athens; very potent he,"
567,THE WHITE SAIL.,And flexile-throated as the nightingale.
568,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With all his fingers knit about his knee,"
569,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And head against a hoary pillar raised,"
570,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Dream-locked, upon the lowest sprayey ledge,"
571,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Riddling the unintelligible space,--"
572,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Void thrones, and filmy wakes of fugitives,"
573,THE WHITE SAIL.,And interstellar agonies of midnight;
574,THE WHITE SAIL.,To him the king’s voice throbbed a second time:
575,THE WHITE SAIL.,‘Rhodalus! sing thou what shall heal my soul.’
576,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Who, grave with poesy’s most candid mien,"
577,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Answered the summons softly: ‘Sire, I cannot."
578,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The music of my brothers is amiss,"
579,THE WHITE SAIL.,"So mine would be. Our strings are jangled, wrested"
580,THE WHITE SAIL.,"From their discreet and silvern vassalage,"
581,THE WHITE SAIL.,Snapped quite with languishment for Theseus’ sake.
582,THE WHITE SAIL.,I cannot sing. But O you holy stars!
583,THE WHITE SAIL.,Stretching to us your tendrils of high glory;
584,THE WHITE SAIL.,Tacit compellers of our wayward spirits;
585,THE WHITE SAIL.,"You domèd guardians of this tear-bound earth,"
586,THE WHITE SAIL.,"You rich-wrought visions, charioted thousands"
587,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Hale rank on rank, thro’ warless cities riding!"
588,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Young semispheric moon, O burning Seven,"
589,THE WHITE SAIL.,Hesper and Phosphor! blue hour-measuring orbs
590,THE WHITE SAIL.,"That elsewhere look on Theseus! Speed his pinnace,"
591,THE WHITE SAIL.,Bide thro’ the watches with us; shine; exhale not!’
592,THE WHITE SAIL.,And the dense quiet bound them.
593,THE WHITE SAIL.,
594,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Cautiously,"
595,THE WHITE SAIL.,"In his far corner, one behind the king"
596,THE WHITE SAIL.,"At the dumb bursting-point of that weird hush,"
597,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With nervous finger twitched his neighbor’s sleeve,"
598,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And strove to whisper him with palsied tongue,"
599,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And straight relaxed, and smiled; but new-convinced"
600,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Towards twilight’s gracious advent, crept in awe"
601,THE WHITE SAIL.,"With arm extended, to his fellow’s side;"
602,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And the two thrilled alike, immovable,"
603,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Each palm down-roofed above the frantic eye,"
604,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Froze at their posts: which eager Theron marked,"
605,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Piloting his keen sight across the main,"
606,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And smote his bosom with quick-smothered groan,"
607,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And, breathless, gazed and gazed. By twos and threes"
608,THE WHITE SAIL.,The apprehensive company dropped aghast
609,THE WHITE SAIL.,Out on the reeling ragged precipice
610,THE WHITE SAIL.,Sparkled and shelled with the oncoming tide:
611,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Till Ægeus, slow-divining dupe of hope,"
612,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Awoke, and knelt him down against his throne,"
613,THE WHITE SAIL.,Faint with thanksgiving. And the moments creaked
614,THE WHITE SAIL.,"In gyral passage, like Ixion’s wheel,"
615,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Spoke on accursèd spoke, portending woe."
616,THE WHITE SAIL.,"But he, athwart his lonely pinnacle"
617,THE WHITE SAIL.,Called like a ghost from walled eternity:
618,THE WHITE SAIL.,‘What of the sail? What cheer?’ Their lips congealed
619,THE WHITE SAIL.,Nothing replied. The cruel hour rolled on.
620,THE WHITE SAIL.,Intolerable arid east-blown wave
621,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Vaulting on wave thro’ all her caverns loud,"
622,THE WHITE SAIL.,Far upon Oliaros boomed the sea.
623,THE WHITE SAIL.,
624,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Then bearded Rhodalus, compassionate,"
625,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Spied leaning o’er the crags the frenzied king,"
626,THE WHITE SAIL.,Rending his garment to the paling moon;
627,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And yet evasive of those pleading eyes,"
628,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Knotting his arms against his breast, downcast,"
629,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Adjured him: ‘O most reverend, O most dear!"
630,THE WHITE SAIL.,The heart of life is rotten; prayer is vain.
631,THE WHITE SAIL.,Stay up thy soul: for lo! the sail is black.’
632,THE WHITE SAIL.,And all the trancèd host burst into moan.
633,THE WHITE SAIL.,
634,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Old Ægeus, like a dreamer, muttered ‘Aye,’"
635,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Passive; and from his brain the fever fell,"
636,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And more than Zeus himself, he things unseen"
637,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Saw, and to unheard choirings lent his ear."
638,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Theseus, truth-speaking, vowed the sky-sail white;"
639,THE WHITE SAIL.,The sail was black: therefore was Theseus dead
640,THE WHITE SAIL.,"In untriumphant state; his comrades, dead;"
641,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Dead, the emprise of Greece; her dynasty"
642,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Ungendered, dead; the very gods were dead!"
643,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And he alive, alive? a wind-worn leaf"
644,THE WHITE SAIL.,All winter gibbeted upon that bough
645,THE WHITE SAIL.,Whence the last fruit was reft? O mockery!
646,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Inert, of his own broken heart impelled,"
647,THE WHITE SAIL.,"From the steep, solitary trysting-place,"
648,THE WHITE SAIL.,"King Ægeus, like a stone, dropped in the sea."
649,THE WHITE SAIL.,
650,THE WHITE SAIL.,"A wraith of smoke, fast-driven against a flame,"
651,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Yon by the crimsoning east the dark ship moved,"
652,THE WHITE SAIL.,Her herald noises strangely borne ashore:
653,THE WHITE SAIL.,"‘Joy, joy!’ and interlinked: ‘O joy, O joy,"
654,THE WHITE SAIL.,Athens our mother! joy to all thy gates!’
655,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And thunderous firm acclaim of minstrelsy,"
656,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Laughter, and antheming, and salvos wild"
657,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Outran the racing prow. But mute they lay,"
658,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The blinded watchers, spent beyond desire,"
659,THE WHITE SAIL.,Wounded beyond this wonder’s balsaming.
660,THE WHITE SAIL.,
661,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Yet ever, thro’ the trembling lovely light,"
662,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Known voice on voice re-echoed, face on face"
663,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Uprose in resurrection. They were safe,"
664,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And Athens, hark! from her long thraldom free!"
665,THE WHITE SAIL.,"And Theseus, victor, sang and sailed with them,"
666,THE WHITE SAIL.,"The pale unsistered Phædra for his bride,"
667,THE WHITE SAIL.,For whom was constant Ariadne cast
668,THE WHITE SAIL.,"On Naxos, where a god did comfort her."
669,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Theseus! who when his bark the shallows grazed,"
670,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Leaped in the gentle waves for boyish glee,"
671,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Gained the thronged highway, crossed it at a bound,"
672,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Scaling the cliffs; and stood among them there,"
673,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Clausus, and his dear Theron, and the rest,"
674,THE WHITE SAIL.,Nodding upon the clamorous crowd below;
675,THE WHITE SAIL.,"But they, as soon, had turned them blunt away,"
676,THE WHITE SAIL.,"In hot resentment of that false one. He,"
677,THE WHITE SAIL.,"O’erbrimming with frank welcomes, in dismay,"
678,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Stricken with sight of unresponsive hands,"
679,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Scenting disaster, reining up his tongue,"
680,THE WHITE SAIL.,Asked sharply for the king.
681,THE WHITE SAIL.,
682,THE WHITE SAIL.,He understood
683,THE WHITE SAIL.,"After mad struggle and bewilderment,"
684,THE WHITE SAIL.,And gloomy gazing on the absent deeps.
685,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Down on the penitential rock he sank,"
686,THE WHITE SAIL.,"All his fair body palpitant with shame,"
687,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Syllabing agony: ‘Ægeus, Ægeus! ah,"
688,THE WHITE SAIL.,Glory of Hellas! dead for trust in me.
689,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Life-giver, irrecoverable friend,"
690,THE WHITE SAIL.,"My father! ah, ah, loving father mine,"
691,THE WHITE SAIL.,"Ah, dear my father!... I forgot the sail.’"
692,THE WHITE SAIL.,
693,THE WHITE SAIL.,And the great morn burst. On a hundred hills
694,THE WHITE SAIL.,The marigold unbarred her casement bright.

705,TARPEIA.,
706,TARPEIA.,
707,TARPEIA.,WOE: lightly to part with one’s soul as the sea with its foam!
708,TARPEIA.,"Woe to Tarpeia, Tarpeia, daughter of Rome!"
709,TARPEIA.,
710,TARPEIA.,"Lo, now it was night, with the moon looking chill as she went:"
711,TARPEIA.,It was morn when the innocent stranger strayed into the tent.
712,TARPEIA.,
713,TARPEIA.,"The hostile Sabini were pleased, as one meshing a bird;"
714,TARPEIA.,She sang for them there in the ambush: they smiled as they heard.
715,TARPEIA.,
716,TARPEIA.,"Her sombre hair purpled in gleams, as she leaned to the light;"
717,TARPEIA.,"All day she had idled and feasted, and now it was night."
718,TARPEIA.,
719,TARPEIA.,"The chief sat apart, heavy-browed, brooding elbow on knee;"
720,TARPEIA.,"The armlets he wore were thrice royal, and wondrous to see:"
721,TARPEIA.,
722,TARPEIA.,"Exquisite artifice, whorls of barbaric design,"
723,TARPEIA.,Frost’s fixèd mimicry; orbic imaginings fine
724,TARPEIA.,
725,TARPEIA.,"In sevenfold coils: and in orient glimmer from them,"
726,TARPEIA.,The variform voluble swinging of gem upon gem.
727,TARPEIA.,
728,TARPEIA.,And the glory thereof sent fever and fire to her eye.
729,TARPEIA.,"‘I had never such trinkets!’ she sighed,--like a lute was her sigh."
730,TARPEIA.,
731,TARPEIA.,"‘Were they mine at the plea, were they mine for the token, all told,"
732,TARPEIA.,"Now the citadel sleeps, now my father the keeper is old,"
733,TARPEIA.,
734,TARPEIA.,"‘If I go by the way that I know, and thou followest hard,"
735,TARPEIA.,If yet at the touch of Tarpeia the gates be unbarred?’
736,TARPEIA.,
737,TARPEIA.,"The chief trembled sharply for joy, then drew rein on his soul:"
738,TARPEIA.,‘Of all this arm beareth I swear I will cede thee the whole.’
739,TARPEIA.,
740,TARPEIA.,"And up from the nooks of the camp, with hoarse plaudit outdealt,"
741,TARPEIA.,"The bearded Sabini glanced hotly, and vowed as they knelt,"
742,TARPEIA.,
743,TARPEIA.,Bare-stretching the wrists that bore also the glowing great boon:
744,TARPEIA.,"‘Yea! surely as over us shineth the lurid low moon,"
745,TARPEIA.,
746,TARPEIA.,"‘Not alone of our lord, but of each of us take what he hath!"
747,TARPEIA.,"Too poor is the guerdon, if thou wilt but show us the path.’"
748,TARPEIA.,
749,TARPEIA.,"Her nostril upraised, like a fawn’s on the arrowy air,"
750,TARPEIA.,"She sped; in a serpentine gleam to the precipice stair,"
751,TARPEIA.,
752,TARPEIA.,"They climbed in her traces, they closed on their evil swift star:"
753,TARPEIA.,"She bent to the latches, and swung the huge portal ajar."
754,TARPEIA.,
755,TARPEIA.,"Repulsed where they passed her, half-tearful for wounded belief,"
756,TARPEIA.,"‘The bracelets!’ she pleaded. Then faced her the leonine chief,"
757,TARPEIA.,"And answered her: ‘Even as I promised, maid-merchant, I do.’"
758,TARPEIA.,Down from his dark shoulder the baubles he sullenly drew.
759,TARPEIA.,
760,TARPEIA.,‘This left arm shall nothing begrudge thee. Accept. Find it sweet.
761,TARPEIA.,"Give, too, O my brothers!’ The jewels he flung at her feet,"
762,TARPEIA.,
763,TARPEIA.,"The jewels hard, heavy; she stooped to them, flushing with dread,"
764,TARPEIA.,But the shield he flung after: it clanged on her beautiful head.
765,TARPEIA.,
766,TARPEIA.,"Like the Apennine bells when the villagers’ warnings begin,"
767,TARPEIA.,Athwart the first lull broke the ominous din upon din;
768,TARPEIA.,
