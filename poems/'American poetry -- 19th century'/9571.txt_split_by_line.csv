53,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.
54,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
55,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The inmates of the family at the Whittier homestead who are
56,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"referred to in the poem were my father, mother, my brother and two"
57,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"sisters, and my uncle and aunt both unmarried. In addition, there"
58,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"was the district school-master who boarded with us. The ""not"
59,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"unfeared, half-welcome guest"" was Harriet Livermore, daughter of"
60,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Judge Livermore, of New Hampshire, a young woman of fine natural"
61,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"ability, enthusiastic, eccentric, with slight control over her"
62,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"violent temper, which sometimes made her religious profession"
63,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,doubtful. She was equally ready to exhort in school-house
64,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"prayer-meetings and dance in a Washington ball-room, while her"
65,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,father was a member of Congress. She early embraced the doctrine of
66,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"the Second Advent, and felt it her duty to proclaim the Lord's"
67,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,speedy coming. With this message she crossed the Atlantic and spent
68,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,the greater part of a long life in travelling over Europe and Asia.
69,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"She lived some time with Lady Hester Stanhope, a woman as fantastic"
70,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"and mentally strained as herself, on the slope of Mt. Lebanon, but"
71,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,finally quarrelled with her in regard to two white horses with red
72,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"marks on their backs which suggested the idea of saddles, on which"
73,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,her titled hostess expected to ride into Jerusalem with the Lord. A
74,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"friend of mine found her, when quite an old woman, wandering in"
75,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Syria with a tribe of Arabs, who with the Oriental notion that"
76,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"madness is inspiration, accepted her as their prophetess and"
77,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,leader. At the time referred to in Snow-Bound she was boarding at
78,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,the Rocks Village about two miles from us.
79,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
80,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"In my boyhood, in our lonely farm-house, we had scanty sources of"
81,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,information; few books and only a small weekly newspaper. Our only
82,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,annual was the Almanac. Under such circumstances story-telling was
83,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,a necessary resource in the long winter evenings. My father when a
84,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"young man had traversed the wilderness to Canada, and could tell us"
85,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"of his adventures with Indians and wild beasts, and of his sojourn"
86,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,in the French villages. My uncle was ready with his record of
87,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"hunting and fishing and, it must be confessed, with stories which"
88,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"he at least half believed, of witchcraft and apparitions. My"
89,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"mother, who was born in the Indian-haunted region of Somersworth,"
90,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"New Hampshire, between Dover and Portsmouth, told us of the inroads"
91,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"of the savages, and the narrow escape of her ancestors. She"
92,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"described strange people who lived on the Piscataqua and Cocheco,"
93,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,among whom was Bantam the sorcerer. I have in my possession the
94,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"wizard's ""conjuring book,"" which he solemnly opened when consulted."
95,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"It is a copy of Cornelius Agrippa's Magic printed in 1651,"
96,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"dedicated to Dr. Robert Child, who, like Michael Scott, had"
97,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"learned ""the art of glammorie In Padua beyond the sea,"" and who is"
98,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"famous in the annals of Massachusetts, where he was at one time a"
99,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"resident, as the first man who dared petition the General Court for"
100,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,liberty of conscience. The full title of the book is Three Books of
101,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Occult Philosophy, by Henry Cornelius Agrippa, Knight, Doctor of"
102,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"both Laws, Counsellor to Caesar's Sacred Majesty and Judge of the"
103,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Prerogative Court.
104,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
105,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"""As the Spirits of Darkness be stronger in the dark, so Good"
106,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Spirits, which be Angels of Light, are augmented not only by the"
107,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Divine light of the Sun, but also by our common Wood Fire: and as"
108,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"the Celestial Fire drives away dark spirits, so also this our Fire"
109,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"of Wood doth the same.""--Cor. AGRIPPA, Occult Philosophy, Book I."
110,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,ch. v.
111,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
112,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"""Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,"
113,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,"
114,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air
115,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Hides hills and woods, the rivet and the heaven,"
116,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And veils the farm-house at the garden's end.
117,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet"
118,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit"
119,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed"
120,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"In a tumultuous privacy of storm."""
121,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Emerson. The Snow Storm.
122,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
123,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
124,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The sun that brief December day
125,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Rose cheerless over hills of gray,"
126,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"And, darkly circled, gave at noon"
127,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,A sadder light than waning moon.
128,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Slow tracing down the thickening sky
129,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Its mute and ominous prophecy,"
130,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"A portent seeming less than threat,"
131,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,It sank from sight before it set.
132,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"A chill no coat, however stout,"
133,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Of homespun stuff could quite, shut out,"
134,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"A hard, dull bitterness of cold,"
135,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"That checked, mid-vein, the circling race"
136,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Of life-blood in the sharpened face,"
137,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The coming of the snow-storm told.
138,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The wind blew east; we heard the roar
139,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Of Ocean on his wintry shore,"
140,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And felt the strong pulse throbbing there
141,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Beat with low rhythm our inland air.
142,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
143,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Meanwhile we did our nightly chores,--"
144,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Brought in the wood from out of doors,"
145,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Littered the stalls, and from the mows"
146,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Raked down the herd's-grass for the cows
147,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Heard the horse whinnying for his corn;
148,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"And, sharply clashing horn on horn,"
149,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Impatient down the stanchion rows
150,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The cattle shake their walnut bows;
151,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"While, peering from his early perch"
152,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Upon the scaffold's pole of birch,"
153,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The cock his crested helmet bent
154,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And down his querulous challenge sent.
155,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
156,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Unwarmed by any sunset light
157,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The gray day darkened into night,"
158,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"A night made hoary with the swarm,"
159,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"And whirl-dance of the blinding storm,"
160,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"As zigzag, wavering to and fro,"
161,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Crossed and recrossed the winged snow
162,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And ere the early bedtime came
163,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The white drift piled the window-frame,"
164,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And through the glass the clothes-line posts
165,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts.
166,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
167,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,So all night long the storm roared on
168,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The morning broke without a sun;
169,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,In tiny spherule traced with lines
170,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Of Nature's geometric signs,"
171,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"In starry flake, and pellicle,"
172,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,All day the hoary meteor fell;
173,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"And, when the second morning shone,"
174,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"We looked upon a world unknown,"
175,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,On nothing we could call our own.
176,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Around the glistening wonder bent
177,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The blue walls of the firmament,"
178,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"No cloud above, no earth below,--"
179,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,A universe of sky and snow
180,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The old familiar sights of ours
181,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Took marvellous shapes; strange domes and towers
182,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Rose up where sty or corn-crib stood,"
183,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Or garden-wall, or belt of wood;"
184,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"A smooth white mound the brush-pile showed,"
185,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,A fenceless drift what once was road;
186,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The bridle-post an old man sat
187,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,With loose-flung coat and high cocked hat;
188,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The well-curb had a Chinese roof;
189,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"And even the long sweep, high aloof,"
190,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"In its slant splendor, seemed to tell"
191,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Of Pisa's leaning miracle.
192,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
193,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"A prompt, decisive man, no breath"
194,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Our father wasted: ""Boys, a path!"""
195,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Well pleased, (for when did farmer boy"
196,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Count such a summons less than joy?)
197,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Our buskins on our feet we drew;
198,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"With mittened hands, and caps drawn low,"
199,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"To guard our necks and ears from snow,"
200,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,We cut the solid whiteness through.
201,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"And, where the drift was deepest, made"
202,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,A tunnel walled and overlaid
203,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,With dazzling crystal: we had read
204,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Of rare Aladdin's wondrous cave,"
205,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"And to our own his name we gave,"
206,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,With many a wish the luck were ours
207,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,To test his lamp's supernal powers.
208,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"We reached the barn with merry din,"
209,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And roused the prisoned brutes within.
210,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The old horse thrust his long head out,"
211,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And grave with wonder gazed about;
212,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The cock his lusty greeting said,"
213,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And forth his speckled harem led;
214,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The oxen lashed their tails, and hooked,"
215,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And mild reproach of hunger looked;
216,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The horned patriarch of the sheep,"
217,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Like Egypt's Amun roused from sleep,"
218,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Shook his sage head with gesture mute,"
219,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And emphasized with stamp of foot.
220,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
221,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,All day the gusty north-wind bore
222,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The loosening drift its breath before;
223,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Low circling round its southern zone,"
224,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The sun through dazzling snow-mist shone.
225,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,No church-bell lent its Christian tone
226,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"To the savage air, no social smoke"
227,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Curled over woods of snow-hung oak.
228,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,A solitude made more intense
229,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"By dreary-voiced elements,"
230,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The shrieking of the mindless wind,"
231,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The moaning tree-boughs swaying blind,"
232,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And on the glass the unmeaning beat
233,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Of ghostly finger-tips of sleet.
234,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Beyond the circle of our hearth
235,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,No welcome sound of toil or mirth
236,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Unbound the spell, and testified"
237,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Of human life and thought outside.
238,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,We minded that the sharpest ear
239,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The buried brooklet could not hear,"
240,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The music of whose liquid lip
241,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Had been to us companionship,"
242,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"And, in our lonely life, had grown"
243,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,To have an almost human tone.
244,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
245,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"As night drew on, and, from the crest"
246,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Of wooded knolls that ridged the west,"
247,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The sun, a snow-blown traveller, sank"
248,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"From sight beneath the smothering bank,"
249,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"We piled, with care, our nightly stack"
250,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Of wood against the chimney-back,--"
251,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The oaken log, green, huge, and thick,"
252,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And on its top the stout back-stick;
253,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The knotty forestick laid apart,"
254,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And filled between with curious art
255,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The ragged brush; then, hovering near,"
256,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"We watched the first red blaze appear,"
257,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Heard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam"
258,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"On whitewashed wall and sagging beam,"
259,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Until the old, rude-furnished room"
260,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Burst, flower-like, into rosy bloom;"
261,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,While radiant with a mimic flame
262,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Outside the sparkling drift became,"
263,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And through the bare-boughed lilac-tree
264,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Our own warm hearth seemed blazing free.
265,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The crane and pendent trammels showed,"
266,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The Turks' heads on the andirons glowed;
267,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"While childish fancy, prompt to tell"
268,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The meaning of the miracle,"
269,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Whispered the old rhyme: ""_Under the tree,"
270,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"When fire outdoors burns merrily,"
271,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"There the witches are making tea_."""
272,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
273,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The moon above the eastern wood
274,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Shone at its full; the hill-range stood
275,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Transfigured in the silver flood,"
276,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Its blown snows flashing cold and keen,"
277,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Dead white, save where some sharp ravine"
278,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Took shadow, or the sombre green"
279,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Of hemlocks turned to pitchy black
280,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Against the whiteness at their back.
281,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,For such a world and such a night
282,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Most fitting that unwarming light,"
283,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Which only seemed where'er it fell
284,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,To make the coldness visible.
285,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
286,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Shut in from all the world without,"
287,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"We sat the clean-winged hearth about,"
288,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Content to let the north-wind roar
289,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"In baffled rage at pane and door,"
290,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,While the red logs before us beat
291,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The frost-line back with tropic heat;
292,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"And ever, when a louder blast"
293,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Shook beam and rafter as it passed,"
294,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The merrier up its roaring draught
295,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The great throat of the chimney laughed;
296,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The house-dog on his paws outspread
297,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Laid to the fire his drowsy head,"
298,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The cat's dark silhouette on the wall
299,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,A couchant tiger's seemed to fall;
300,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"And, for the winter fireside meet,"
301,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Between the andirons' straddling feet,"
302,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The mug of cider simmered slow,"
303,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The apples sputtered in a row,"
304,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"And, close at hand, the basket stood"
305,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,With nuts from brown October's wood.
306,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,
307,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,What matter how the night behaved?
308,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,What matter how the north-wind raved?
309,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Blow high, blow low, not all its snow"
310,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Could quench our hearth-fire's ruddy glow.
311,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,O Time and Change!--with hair as gray
312,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"As was my sire's that winter day,"
313,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"How strange it seems, with so much gone"
314,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Of life and love, to still live on!"
315,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Ah, brother! only I and thou"
316,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Are left of all that circle now,--"
317,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The dear home faces whereupon
318,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,That fitful firelight paled and shone.
319,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Henceforward, listen as we will,"
320,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The voices of that hearth are still;
321,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Look where we may, the wide earth o'er"
322,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Those lighted faces smile no more.
323,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"We tread the paths their feet have worn,"
324,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"We sit beneath their orchard trees,"
325,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"We hear, like them, the hum of bees"
326,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,And rustle of the bladed corn;
327,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"We turn the pages that they read,"
328,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Their written words we linger o'er,"
329,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"But in the sun they cast no shade,"
330,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"No voice is heard, no sign is made,"
331,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,No step is on the conscious floor!
332,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Yet Love will dream, and Faith will trust,"
333,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"(Since He who knows our need is just,)"
334,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"That somehow, somewhere, meet we must."
335,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Alas for him who never sees
336,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,The stars shine through his cypress-trees
337,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Who, hopeless, lays his dead away,"
338,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Nor looks to see the breaking day
339,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,Across the mournful marbles play!
340,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Who hath not learned, in hours of faith,"
341,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"The truth to flesh and sense unknown,"
342,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"That Life is ever lord of Death,"
