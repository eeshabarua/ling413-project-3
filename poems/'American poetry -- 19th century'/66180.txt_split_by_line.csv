71,PREFACE.,"In introducing this volume to the Public, the Author would simply"
72,PREFACE.,"remark, that it was written at different periods of a college life,"
73,PREFACE.,which has just expired; (the Scripture Sketches at a very early part of
74,PREFACE.,"it.) He has no intention of screening its faults, either of feeling or"
75,PREFACE.,"style, beneath his ‘score of summers;’ but as prefaces are the fashion,"
76,PREFACE.,he has thought the mention of the fact would not be amiss in the
77,PREFACE.,promotion of a proper understanding between himself and his readers.

123,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,
124,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,
125,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Morn breaketh in the east. The purple clouds
126,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Are putting on their gold and violet,"
127,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,To look the meeter for the sun’s bright coming.
128,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Sleep is upon the waters and the wind;
129,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And nature, from the tremulous forest leaf"
130,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"To her majestic master, sleeps. As yet"
131,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"There is no mist upon the deep blue sky,"
132,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,And the clear dew is on the blushing bosoms
133,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Of crimson roses, in a holy rest."
134,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"How hallowed is the hour of morning! meet,"
135,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Aye, beautifully meet, for the pure prayer."
136,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,
137,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"The patriarch standeth at his tented door,"
138,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,With his white locks uncovered. ’Tis his wont
139,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,To gaze upon the gorgeous orient;
140,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,And at that hour the awful majesty
141,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Of one who talketh often with his God,"
142,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Is wont to come again and clothe his brow
143,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,As at his fourscore strength. But now he seemeth
144,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"To be forgetful of his vigorous frame,"
145,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,And boweth to his staff as at the hour
146,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Of noontide sultriness; and that bright sun!
147,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"He looketh at its pencilled messengers,"
148,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Coming in golden raiment, as if light"
149,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Were opening a fearful scroll in heaven.
150,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Ah! he is waiting till it herald in
151,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,The hour to sacrifice his much loved son!
152,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,
153,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Light poureth on the world. And Sarah stands,"
154,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Watching the steps of Abraham and her child
155,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Along the dewy sides of the far hills,"
156,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,And praying that her sunny boy faint not.
157,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Would she have watched their path so silently,"
158,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"If she had known that he was going up,"
159,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Even in his fair-haired beauty, to be slain"
160,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,As a white lamb for sacrifice? They trod
161,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Together onward, patriarch and child;"
162,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"The bright sun throwing back the old man’s shade,"
163,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"In straight and fair proportions, as of one"
164,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Erect in early vigor. He stood up
165,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Firm in his better strength, and like a tree"
166,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Rooted in Lebanon, his frame bent not."
167,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"His thin, white hairs had yielded to the wind,"
168,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And left his brow uncovered; and his face,"
169,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Impressed with the stern majesty of grief,"
170,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Nerved to a solemn duty, now stood forth"
171,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Like a rent rock, submissive, yet sublime."
172,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"But the young boy, he of the laughing eye"
173,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And ruby lip, the pride of life was on him."
174,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"He seemed to drink the morning. Sun and dew,"
175,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And the aroma of the spicy trees,"
176,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,And all that giveth the delicious East
177,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Its fitness for an Eden, stole like light"
178,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Into his spirit, ravishing his thoughts"
179,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"With love and beauty. Every thing he met,"
180,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Floating or beautiful, the lightest wing"
181,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Of bird or insect, or the palest dye"
182,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Of the fresh flowers, won him from his path;"
183,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And joyously broke forth his tiny shout,"
184,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"As he flung back his silken hair, and sprung"
185,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Away to some green spot or clustering vine,"
186,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,To pluck his infant trophies. Every tree
187,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And fragrant shrub was a new hiding-place,"
188,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And he would crouch till the old man came by,"
189,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Then bound before him with his childish laugh,"
190,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Stealing a look behind him playfully,"
191,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,To see if he had made his father smile.
192,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,
193,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,The sun rode on in heaven. The dew stole up
194,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Like a light veil from nature, and the heat"
195,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Came like a sleep upon the delicate leaves,"
196,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,And bent them with the blossoms to their dreams.
197,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Still trod the patriarch on with that same step,"
198,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Firm and unfaltering, turning not aside"
199,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"To seek the olive shades, or lave his lips"
200,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"In the sweet waters of the Syrian wells,"
201,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Whose gush hath so much music. Weariness
202,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Stole on the gentle boy, and he forgot"
203,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"To toss his sunny hair from off his brow,"
204,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And spring for the light wings and gaudy flowers,"
205,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,As in the early morning; but he kept
206,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Close by his father’s side, and bent his head"
207,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Upon his bosom like a drooping bud,"
208,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Lifting it not, save now and then to steal"
209,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,A look up to the face whose sternness awed
210,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,His childishness to silence.
211,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,
212,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,It was noon;
213,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And Abraham on Moriah bowed himself,"
214,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And buried up his face, and prayed for strength."
215,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,He could not look upon his son and pray;
216,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,But with his hand upon the clustering curls
217,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Of the fair, kneeling boy, he prayed that God"
218,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Would nerve him for that hour. Oh! man was made
219,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,For the stern conflict. In a mother’s love
220,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,There is more tenderness; the thousand cords
221,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Woven with every fibre of her heart,"
222,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Complain, like delicate harp strings, at a breath;"
223,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"But love in man is one deep principle,"
224,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Which, yielding not to lighter influence,"
225,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"Abides the tempest. He rose up, and laid"
226,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,The wood upon the altar. All was done.
227,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"He stood a moment, and a vivid flush"
228,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Passed o’er his countenance; and then he nerved
229,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"His spirit with a bitter strength, and spoke:"
230,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"‘Isaac! my only son!’ The boy looked up,"
231,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And Abraham turned his face away, and wept."
232,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"‘Where is the lamb, my father?’ Oh! the tones,"
233,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"The sweet, the thrilling music of a child!"
234,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,How it doth agonize at such an hour!
235,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"It was the last, deep struggle. Abraham held"
236,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"His loved, his beautiful, his only son,"
237,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,"And lifted up his arm, and called on God--"
238,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,And lo! God’s Angel stayed him; and he fell
239,THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM.,Upon his face and wept.

244,ABSALOM.,ABSALOM.
245,ABSALOM.,
246,ABSALOM.,
247,ABSALOM.,The waters slept. Night’s silvery veil hung low
248,ABSALOM.,"On Jordan’s bosom, and the eddies curled"
249,ABSALOM.,"Their glassy rings beneath it, like the still"
250,ABSALOM.,Unbroken beating of the sleeper’s pulse.
251,ABSALOM.,"The reeds bent down the stream. The willow leaves,"
252,ABSALOM.,"With a soft cheek upon the lulling tide,"
253,ABSALOM.,"Forgot the lifting winds; and the long stems,"
254,ABSALOM.,"Whose flowers the water, like a gentle nurse,"
255,ABSALOM.,"Bears on its bosom, quietly gave way"
256,ABSALOM.,And leaned in graceful attitudes to rest.
257,ABSALOM.,"How strikingly the course of nature tells,"
258,ABSALOM.,"By its light heed of human suffering,"
259,ABSALOM.,That it was fashioned for a perfect world!
260,ABSALOM.,
261,ABSALOM.,King David’s limbs were weary. He had fled
262,ABSALOM.,"From far Jerusalem, and now he stood"
263,ABSALOM.,With his faint people for a little rest
264,ABSALOM.,Upon the shore of Jordan. The light wind
265,ABSALOM.,"Of morn was stirring, and he bared his brow"
266,ABSALOM.,To its refreshing breath; for he had worn
267,ABSALOM.,"The mourner’s covering, and he had not felt"
268,ABSALOM.,That he could see his people until now.
269,ABSALOM.,"They gathered round him on the fresh green bank,"
270,ABSALOM.,And spoke their kindly words; and as the sun
271,ABSALOM.,"Rose up in heaven, he knelt among them there,"
272,ABSALOM.,And bowed his head upon his hands to pray.
273,ABSALOM.,"Oh! when the heart is full, when bitter thoughts"
274,ABSALOM.,"Come crowding thickly up for utterance,"
275,ABSALOM.,And the poor common words of courtesy
276,ABSALOM.,"Are such a very mockery, how much"
277,ABSALOM.,The bursting heart may pour itself in prayer!
278,ABSALOM.,He prayed for Israel; and his voice went up
279,ABSALOM.,Strongly and fervently; he prayed for those
280,ABSALOM.,Whose love had been his shield; and his deep tones
281,ABSALOM.,Grew tremulous; but oh! for Absalom!
282,ABSALOM.,"For his estranged, misguided Absalom--"
283,ABSALOM.,"The proud, bright being who had burst away,"
284,ABSALOM.,"In all his princely beauty, to defy"
285,ABSALOM.,"The heart that cherished him--for him he poured,"
286,ABSALOM.,"In agony that would not be controlled,"
287,ABSALOM.,"Strong supplication, and forgave him there"
288,ABSALOM.,"Before his God, for his deep sinfulness."
289,ABSALOM.,
290,ABSALOM.,The hosts were numbered. At Mahanaim’s gate
291,ABSALOM.,"Sat David, as the glittering thousands passed"
292,ABSALOM.,Forth to the battle. With a troubled eye
293,ABSALOM.,"He looked upon their pomp, and as the helms"
294,ABSALOM.,"Bent low before him, and the banners swayed"
295,ABSALOM.,"Like burnished wings to do him reverence,"
296,ABSALOM.,"His look grew restless, and he did not wear"
297,ABSALOM.,The lofty sternness of a monarch’s brow.
298,ABSALOM.,The leader of the host came by. His form
299,ABSALOM.,"Was like a son of Anak, and he strode"
300,ABSALOM.,"Majestically on, and bore his crest"
301,ABSALOM.,"As men were waters, and his frame a rock."
302,ABSALOM.,"The king rose up to Joab, and came near,"
303,ABSALOM.,As his tall helm was bowed; and by the love
304,ABSALOM.,"He bore his master, he besought him there"
305,ABSALOM.,That he would spare him Absalom alive.
306,ABSALOM.,He passed with his stern warriors on; the trump
307,ABSALOM.,And the loud cymbal died upon the ear;
308,ABSALOM.,"And as the king turned off his weary gaze,"
309,ABSALOM.,"The last faint gleam had vanished, and the wood"
310,ABSALOM.,"Of Ephraim had received a thousand men,"
311,ABSALOM.,To whom its pleasant shadows were a grave.
312,ABSALOM.,
313,ABSALOM.,The pall was settled. He who slept beneath
314,ABSALOM.,Was straightened for the grave; and as the folds
315,ABSALOM.,"Sunk to the still proportions, they betrayed"
316,ABSALOM.,The matchless symmetry of Absalom.
317,ABSALOM.,"His hair was yet unshorn, and silken curls"
318,ABSALOM.,Were floating round the tassels as they swayed
319,ABSALOM.,"To the admitted air, as glossy now"
320,ABSALOM.,As when in hours of gentle dalliance bathing
321,ABSALOM.,The snowy fingers of Judea’s girls.
322,ABSALOM.,"His helm was at his feet; his banner, soiled"
323,ABSALOM.,"With trailing through Jerusalem, was laid"
324,ABSALOM.,"Reversed beside him; and the jewelled hilt,"
325,ABSALOM.,"Whose diamonds lit the passage of his blade,"
326,ABSALOM.,Rested like mockery on his covered brow.
327,ABSALOM.,"The soldiers of the king trod to and fro,"
328,ABSALOM.,"Clad in the garb of battle, and their chief,"
329,ABSALOM.,"The mighty Joab, stood beside his bier"
330,ABSALOM.,"And gazed upon the dark pall stedfastly,"
331,ABSALOM.,As if he feared the slumberer might stir.
332,ABSALOM.,A slow step startled him. He grasped his blade
333,ABSALOM.,As if a trumpet rang; but the bent form
334,ABSALOM.,"Of David entered, and he gave command"
335,ABSALOM.,"In a low tone to his few followers,"
336,ABSALOM.,And left him with his dead. The king stood still
337,ABSALOM.,Till the last echo died; then throwing off
338,ABSALOM.,"The sackcloth from his brow, and laying back"
339,ABSALOM.,"The pall from the still features of his child,"
340,ABSALOM.,"He bowed his head upon him, and broke forth"
341,ABSALOM.,In the resistless eloquence of woe.
342,ABSALOM.,
343,ABSALOM.,"‘Alas! my noble boy, that thou shouldst die!"
344,ABSALOM.,"Thou, who wert made so beautifully fair!"
345,ABSALOM.,"That death should settle in thy glorious eye,"
346,ABSALOM.,And leave his stillness in this clustering hair!
347,ABSALOM.,"How could he mark thee for the silent tomb,"
348,ABSALOM.,"My proud boy, Absalom!"
349,ABSALOM.,
350,ABSALOM.,"‘Cold is thy brow, my son! and I am chill"
351,ABSALOM.,When to my bosom I would try to press thee;
352,ABSALOM.,"How was I wont to feel my pulses thrill,"
353,ABSALOM.,"Like a rich harp string, yearning to caress thee,"
354,ABSALOM.,And hear thy sweet “My Father!” from these dumb
355,ABSALOM.,"And cold lips, Absalom!"
356,ABSALOM.,
357,ABSALOM.,‘The grave hath won thee; I shall hear the gush
358,ABSALOM.,Of music and the voices of the young;
359,ABSALOM.,"And life will pass me in the mantling blush,"
360,ABSALOM.,And the dark tresses to the soft winds flung;
361,ABSALOM.,But thou no more with thy sweet voice shalt come
362,ABSALOM.,"To meet me, Absalom!"
363,ABSALOM.,
364,ABSALOM.,"‘And oh! when I am stricken, and my heart"
365,ABSALOM.,Like a bruised reed is waiting to be broken;
366,ABSALOM.,"How will its love for thee, as I depart,"
367,ABSALOM.,Long for thine ear to catch its dying token!
368,ABSALOM.,"It were so sweet, amid death’s gathering gloom,"
369,ABSALOM.,"To see thee, Absalom!"
370,ABSALOM.,
371,ABSALOM.,"‘And now farewell! ’tis hard to give thee up,"
372,ABSALOM.,With death so like a gentle slumber on thee.
373,ABSALOM.,"And thy dark sin--oh! I could drink the cup,"
374,ABSALOM.,If from this woe its bitterness had won thee--
375,ABSALOM.,"May God have called thee like a wanderer home,"
376,ABSALOM.,My erring Absalom!’
377,ABSALOM.,
378,ABSALOM.,"He covered up his face, and bowed himself"
379,ABSALOM.,A moment on his child; then giving him
380,ABSALOM.,"A look of melting tenderness, he clasped"
381,ABSALOM.,"His hands convulsively, as if in prayer;"
382,ABSALOM.,"And as a strength were given him of God,"
383,ABSALOM.,"He rose up calmly, and composed the pall"
384,ABSALOM.,"About him decently, and left him there"
385,ABSALOM.,As if his rest had been a breathing sleep.

391,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
392,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
393,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,The morning broke. Light stole upon the clouds
394,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,With a strange beauty. Earth received again
395,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Its garment of a thousand dies; and leaves,"
396,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"And delicate blossoms, and the painted flowers,"
397,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"And every thing that bendeth to the dew,"
398,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"And stirreth with the daylight, lifted up"
399,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Its beauty to the breath of that sweet morn.
400,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
401,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,All things are dark to sorrow; and the light
402,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"And loveliness, and fragrant air were sad"
403,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,To the dejected Hagar. The moist earth
404,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Was pouring odors from its spicy pores,"
405,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,And the young birds were caroling as life
406,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Were a new thing to them; but oh! it came
407,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Upon her heart like discord, and she felt"
408,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"How cruelly it tries a broken heart,"
409,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,To see a mirth in any thing it loves.
410,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,She stood at Abraham’s tent. Her lips were pressed
411,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Till the blood left them; and the wandering veins
412,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Of her transparent forehead, were swelled out,"
413,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,As if her pride would burst them. Her dark eye
414,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Was clear and tearless, and the light of heaven,"
415,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Which made its language legible, shot back"
416,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"From her long lashes, as it had been flame."
417,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Her noble boy stood by her with his hand
418,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Clasped in her own, and his round, delicate feet,"
419,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Scarce trained to balance on the tented floor,"
420,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Sandaled for journeying. He had looked up
421,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Into his mother’s face until he caught
422,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"The spirit there, and his young heart was swelling"
423,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Beneath his snowy bosom, and his form"
424,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Straightened up proudly in his tiny wrath,"
425,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"As if his light proportions would have swelled,"
426,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Had they but matched his spirit, to the man."
427,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
428,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Why bends the patriarch as he cometh now
429,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Upon his staff so wearily? His beard
430,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Is low upon his breast, and his high brow,"
431,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"So written with the converse of his God,"
432,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Beareth the swollen vein of agony.
433,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"His lip is quivering, and his wonted step"
434,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Of vigor is not there, and though the morn"
435,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Is passing fair and beautiful, he breathes"
436,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Its freshness as it were a pestilence.
437,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Oh! man may bear with suffering; his heart
438,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Is a strong thing, and godlike in the grasp"
439,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Of pain that wrings mortality; but tear
440,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"One cord affection clings to, part one tie"
441,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"That binds him to a woman’s delicate love,"
442,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,And his great spirit yieldeth like a reed.
443,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
444,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"He gave to her the water and the bread,"
445,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"But spoke no word, and trusted not himself"
446,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"To look upon her face, but laid his hand"
447,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"In silent blessing on the fair-haired boy,"
448,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,And left her to her lot of loneliness.
449,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
450,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Should Hagar weep? May slighted woman turn,"
451,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"And as a vine the oak hath shaken off,"
452,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Bend lightly to her tendencies again?
453,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Oh no! by all her loveliness, by all"
454,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"That makes life poetry and beauty, no!"
455,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Make her a slave; steal from her rosy cheek
456,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,By needless jealousies; let the last star
457,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Leave her a watcher by your couch of pain;
458,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Wrong her by petulance, suspicion, all"
459,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,That makes her cup a bitterness--yet give
460,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"One evidence of love, and earth has not"
461,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,An emblem of devotedness like hers.
462,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"But oh! estrange her once, it boots not how,"
463,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"By wrong or silence, any thing that tells"
464,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,A change has come upon your tenderness--
465,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,And there is not a high thing out of heaven
466,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Her pride o’ermastereth not.
467,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
468,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,She went her way with a strong step and slow;
469,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Her pressed lip arched, and her clear eye undimmed,"
470,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"As it had been a diamond, and her form"
471,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Borne proudly up, as if her heart breathed through."
472,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Her child kept on in silence, though she pressed"
473,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"His hand till it was pained; for he had caught,"
474,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"As I have said, her spirit, and the seed"
475,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Of a stern nation had been breathed upon.
476,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
477,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"The morning past, and Asia’s sun rode up"
478,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"In the clear heaven, and every beam was heat."
479,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"The cattle of the hills were in the shade,"
480,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,And the bright plumage of the Orient lay
481,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,On beating bosoms in her spicy trees.
482,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,It was an hour of rest; but Hagar found
483,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"No shelter in the wilderness, and on"
484,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"She kept her weary way, until the boy"
485,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Hung down his head, and opened his parched lips"
486,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,For water; but she could not give it him.
487,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,She laid him down beneath the sultry sky;
488,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"For it was better than the close, hot breath"
489,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Of the thick pines, and tried to comfort him;"
490,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"But he was sore athirst, and his blue eyes"
491,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Were dim and bloodshot, and he could not know"
492,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Why God denied him water in the wild.
493,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"She sat a little longer, and he grew"
494,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Ghastly and faint, as if he would have died."
495,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,It was too much for her. She lifted him
496,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"And bore him farther on, and laid his head"
497,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Beneath the shadow of a desert shrub;
498,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"And shrouding up her face she went away,"
499,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"And sat to watch, where he could see her not,"
500,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Till he should die--and watching him she mourned:--
501,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
502,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"‘God stay thee in thine agony, my boy!"
503,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,I cannot see thee die; I cannot brook
504,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Upon thy brow to look,"
505,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,And see death settle on my cradle joy.
506,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,How have I drunk the light of thy blue eye!
507,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,And could I see thee die?
508,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
509,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"‘I did not dream of this when thou wast straying,"
510,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Like an unbound gazelle, among the flowers;"
511,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Or wearing rosy hours,"
512,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"By the rich gush of water-sources playing,"
513,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Then sinking weary to thy smiling sleep,"
514,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,So beautiful and deep.
515,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
516,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"‘Oh no! and when I watched by thee the while,"
517,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"And saw thy bright lip curling in thy dream,"
518,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,And thought of the dark stream
519,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"In my own land of Egypt, the deep Nile,"
520,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,How prayed I that my fathers’ land might be
521,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,An heritage for thee!
522,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
523,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"‘And now the grave for its cold breast hath won thee,"
524,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"And thy white, delicate limbs the earth will press;"
525,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,And oh! my last caress
526,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"Must feel thee cold, for a chill hand is on thee."
527,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"How can I leave my boy, so pillowed there"
528,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Upon his clustering hair!’
529,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,
530,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,She stood beside the well her God had given
531,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"To gush in that deep wilderness, and bathed"
532,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,The forehead of her child until he laughed
533,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,"In his reviving happiness, and lisped"
534,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,His infant thought of gladness at the sight
535,HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS.,Of the cool plashing of his mother’s hand.

541,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,
542,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,
543,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"She stood before her father’s gorgeous tent,"
544,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,To listen for his coming. Her loose hair
545,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Was resting on her shoulders, like a cloud"
546,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Floating around a statue, and the wind,"
547,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Just swaying her light robe, revealed a shape"
548,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Praxiteles might worship. She had clasped
549,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Her hands upon her bosom, and had raised"
550,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Her beautiful, dark, Jewish eyes to heaven,"
551,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Till the long lashes laid upon her brow.
552,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Her lip was slightly parted, like the leaves"
553,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Of a half-blown pomegranate; and her neck,"
554,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Just where the cheek was melting to its curve,"
555,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"With the unearthly beauty sometimes there,"
556,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Was shaded as if light had fallen off,"
557,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Its surface was so polished. She was quelling
558,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Her light, quick breath, to hear; and the white rose"
559,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Scarce moved upon her bosom as it swelled,"
560,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Like nothing but a wave of light in dreams,"
561,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,To meet the arching of her queenly neck.
562,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Her countenance was radiant with love.
563,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,She looked like one to die for it; a being
564,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Whose whole existence was the pouring out
565,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Of rich and deep affections. I have thought
566,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,A brother’s and a sister’s love was much.
567,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"I know a brother’s is, for I have loved"
568,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,A trusting sister; and I know how broke
569,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,The heart may be with its own tenderness.
570,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,But the affection of a delicate child
571,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"For a fond father, gushing as it does"
572,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"With the sweet springs of life, and living on"
573,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Through all earth’s changes like a principle,"
574,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Chastened with reverence, and made more pure"
575,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"By early discipline of light and shade,--"
576,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,It must be holier!
577,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,
578,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,The wind bore on
579,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,The leaden tramp of thousands. Clarion notes
580,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Rang sharply on the ear at intervals;
581,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"And the low, mingled din of mighty hosts"
582,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Returning from the battle, poured from far,"
583,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Like the deep murmur of a restless sea.
584,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"They came, as earthly conquerors always come,"
585,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"With blood and splendor, revelry and woe."
586,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,The stately horse treads proudly; he hath trod
587,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"The brow of death, as well. The chariot wheels"
588,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Of warriors roll magnificently on;
589,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Their weight hath crushed the fallen. Man is there;
590,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Majestic, lordly man, with his serene"
591,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"And elevated brow and godlike frame,"
592,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Lifting his crest in triumph, for his heel"
593,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Hath trod the dying like a wine-press down!
594,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,
595,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,The mighty Jephthah led his warriors on
596,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Through Mizpeh’s streets. His helm was proudly set,"
597,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"And his stern lip curled slightly, as if praise"
598,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Were for the hero’s scorn. His step was firm,"
599,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"But free as India’s leopard; and his mail,"
600,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Whose shekels none in Israel might bear,"
601,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Was lighter than a tassel on his frame.
602,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"His crest was Judah’s kingliest, and the look"
603,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Of his dark, lofty eye and terrible brow,"
604,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Might quell the lion. He led on; but thoughts
605,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Seemed gathering round which troubled him. The veins
606,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Upon his forehead were distinctly seen;
607,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,And his proud lip was painfully compressed.
608,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,He trod less firmly; and his restless eye
609,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Glanced forward frequently, as if some ill"
610,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"He dared not meet, were there. His home was near;"
611,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"And men were thronging, with that strange delight"
612,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"They have in human passions, to observe"
613,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,The struggle of his feelings with his pride.
614,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,He gazed intensely forward. The tall firs
615,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Before his tent were motionless. The leaves
616,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Of the spiced aloe, and the clustering vines"
617,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Which half concealed his threshold, met his eye"
618,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Unchanged and beautiful; and one by one,"
619,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"The balsam with its sweet-distilling stems,"
620,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"And the Circassian rose, and all the crowd"
621,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Of silent and familiar things, stole up"
622,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Like the recovered passages of dreams.
623,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"He strode on rapidly. A moment more,"
624,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,And he had reached his home; when lo! there sprang
625,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"One with a bounding footstep, and a brow"
626,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Like light, to meet him. Oh! how beautiful!"
627,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Her dark eye flashing like a sun-lit gem,"
628,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,And her luxuriant hair--’twas like the sweep
629,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Of a swift wing in visions! He stood still,"
630,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,As if the sight had withered him. She threw
631,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Her arms about his neck; he heeded not.
632,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"She called him ‘Father,’ but he answered not."
633,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,She stood and gazed upon him. Was he wroth?
634,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,There was no anger in that bloodshot eye.
635,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Had sickness seized him? She unclasped his helm,"
636,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"And laid her white hand gently on his brow,"
637,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,And the large veins felt stiff and hard like cords.
638,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,The touch aroused him. He raised up his hands
639,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,And spoke the name of God in agony.
640,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"She knew that he was stricken, then, and rushed"
641,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Again into his arms, and with a flood"
642,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Of tears she could not bridle, sobbed a prayer"
643,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,That he would tell her of his wretchedness.
644,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"He told her, and a momentary flush"
645,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Shot o’er her countenance; and then the soul
646,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Of Jephthah’s daughter wakened, and she stood"
647,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Calmly and nobly up, and said ‘’Tis well--"
648,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,And I will die!’
649,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,
650,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,The sun had well nigh set.
651,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"The fire was on the altar, and the priest"
652,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Of the High God was there. A wasted man
653,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Was stretching out his withered hands to heaven,"
654,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"As if he would have prayed, but had no words;"
655,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,And she who was to die--the calmest one
656,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,In Israel at that hour--stood up alone
657,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,And waited for the sun to set. Her face
658,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Was pale, but very beautiful; her lip"
659,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"Had a more delicate outline, and the tint"
660,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,Was deeper; but her countenance was like
661,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"The majesty of angels!--The sun set,"
662,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,"And she was dead, but not by violence."
663,JEPHTHAH’S DAUGHTER.,

670,IDLENESS.,"It was a leisure day, and I had shut"
671,IDLENESS.,"My door upon intrusion, and set down"
672,IDLENESS.,With a true book to read. My study fire
673,IDLENESS.,Made music to my ear; the placid brow
674,IDLENESS.,"Of my Madonna, and the shadowy tints"
675,IDLENESS.,"Of an old Flemish picture that I keep,"
676,IDLENESS.,Might pass for company; and for relief
677,IDLENESS.,"To weary eyes, a sweet geranium stood"
678,IDLENESS.,"In the half shuttered window, breathing out"
679,IDLENESS.,Its odors with the pleasant smell of books;
680,IDLENESS.,"And a soft landscape, given me by one"
681,IDLENESS.,"Who has a noble nature, hung in light,"
682,IDLENESS.,Serving me as a ground for poetry.
683,IDLENESS.,
684,IDLENESS.,I read a tale of Séville. It was when
685,IDLENESS.,"Darkness was over Spain, and Christian hearts"
686,IDLENESS.,"Were standing out for truth, undauntedly."
687,IDLENESS.,"The daily light brought martyrdom, and men"
688,IDLENESS.,"Of a pure life went faithfully to die,"
689,IDLENESS.,For the rich hope hereafter. There was set
690,IDLENESS.,A scaffold on the ‘golden Guadalquivir;’
691,IDLENESS.,"And in the greenest valley of the land,"
692,IDLENESS.,With its bright shore and water tempting them
693,IDLENESS.,"Like an affection, did they meekly die."
694,IDLENESS.,"Nobles as just men perished, where their sires"
695,IDLENESS.,Held the chivalric tournament; and one
696,IDLENESS.,"Whose ancestors had been Castilia’s kings,"
697,IDLENESS.,Died calmly. He had loved to come alone
698,IDLENESS.,"And watch that stealing river, and ’tis told"
699,IDLENESS.,"That when the axe fell frequently, he went"
700,IDLENESS.,"Ever at evening there, that he might look"
701,IDLENESS.,"Upon its bloody evidence, and nerve"
702,IDLENESS.,His spirit to the trial.
703,IDLENESS.,
704,IDLENESS.,’Tis a tale
705,IDLENESS.,"Of high and manly fortitude, and one"
706,IDLENESS.,To elevate the nobler nature. I

724,DREAMS.,Coleridge.
725,DREAMS.,
726,DREAMS.,
727,DREAMS.,And what is it to dream? It is to have
728,DREAMS.,A spiritual being. ’Tis to loose
729,DREAMS.,"Th’ unsleeping mind from matter, and believe"
730,DREAMS.,Miraculous and godlike gifts our own.
731,DREAMS.,It is to touch all nature with the wand
732,DREAMS.,"Of faery, and be true and beautiful"
733,DREAMS.,Amid a truer and more beautiful world.
734,DREAMS.,It is to need no contrast that the light
735,DREAMS.,"About us may be visible, and joy"
736,DREAMS.,Mistaken not for sorrow. ’Tis to love
737,DREAMS.,"Dark eyes, and tones like a _secondo_ flute,"
738,DREAMS.,And then be irresistible; and living
739,DREAMS.,"In a sweet granite home, to find your love"
740,DREAMS.,The angel that she seemed in poetry.
741,DREAMS.,
742,DREAMS.,And what is it to dream? It is to know
743,DREAMS.,"The talisman of motion, and soar on"
744,DREAMS.,"To the high places of the upper air,"
745,DREAMS.,Like a superior spirit. ’Tis to glide
746,DREAMS.,"Out upon chainless wanderings, unchecked"
747,DREAMS.,"By time, or distance, or the circumstance"
748,DREAMS.,Of waking reason. ’Tis to weave long years
749,DREAMS.,"Of a still, midnight hour, or crowd a life"
750,DREAMS.,Into a glowing moment; and amid
751,DREAMS.,The measure and the harmony that float
752,DREAMS.,"About us like an element, to find"

754,DREAMS.,
755,DREAMS.,"There’s purity in dreams. The passions lie,"
756,DREAMS.,"With the dull qualities of earth, asleep;"
757,DREAMS.,And the low interests of life are changed
758,DREAMS.,For the etherial vision. We erase
759,DREAMS.,Dark feelings with fantastic incident;
760,DREAMS.,And feel cool fingers laid upon the brow
761,DREAMS.,Where the hot flush is burning. We retrace
762,DREAMS.,"All early time in dreams; and hear the low,"
763,DREAMS.,"Deep cadences of prayer, and press the hand"
764,DREAMS.,That led us to our happy slumbers then.
765,DREAMS.,We look on riper seasons with the eye
766,DREAMS.,"That painted them all sunshine, and forget"
767,DREAMS.,That we have found them shadows; and we trust
768,DREAMS.,"Life’s broken reed as lightly, and repeat"
769,DREAMS.,"Our first young vow as movingly, again."
770,DREAMS.,"Such dreams refresh the feelings, like a pure"
771,DREAMS.,And high communion; for the spirit wears
772,DREAMS.,"No fetter of a poor, particular world,"
773,DREAMS.,"And waits no cold and selfish reasoning,"
774,DREAMS.,To measure out its fervor; but goes back
775,DREAMS.,"Upon the purer memories, and lives o’er"
776,DREAMS.,"The brighter past, alone; and when the heart"
777,DREAMS.,"Hath buried an affection, it unclothes"
778,DREAMS.,"Its image from the drapery of the grave,"
779,DREAMS.,And wins it to its olden tenderness.
780,DREAMS.,
781,DREAMS.,"I’ve read of one in story, who had laid"
782,DREAMS.,His young love in the grave. The seasons came
783,DREAMS.,"And went, like shadows over him, for years;"
784,DREAMS.,"And then the world grew brighter, and he heard"
785,DREAMS.,A melody in nature’s goings on;
786,DREAMS.,"And a sweet cousin’s voice, that tempted him"
787,DREAMS.,"Into the sunshine and the air, became"
788,DREAMS.,"The music of his happiness, and so"
789,DREAMS.,"He married her. One night she was awake,"
790,DREAMS.,And gazing on his features as the moon
791,DREAMS.,Shone through the casement on them. A large tear
792,DREAMS.,"Stole from his eye, and as his lips were stirred"
793,DREAMS.,"With the low murmur of his dream, she caught"
794,DREAMS.,"The name of the departed. He awoke,"
795,DREAMS.,And she reproached him tearfully for love
796,DREAMS.,Kept secret in his heart; and then he kissed
797,DREAMS.,"Her tears away, and told her that his love"
798,DREAMS.,"Was faithfully her own, although in dreams"
799,DREAMS.,"An angel came to him sometimes, and woke"
800,DREAMS.,A buried thought of one as beautiful.

1153,I.,I.
1154,I.,
1155,I.,My heart is like a sleeping lake
1156,I.,"Which takes the hue of cloud and sky,"
1157,I.,And only feels its surface break
1158,I.,"When birds of passage wander by,"
1159,I.,"Who dip their wings and upward soar,"
1160,I.,And leave it quiet as before.
1161,I.,
1162,I.,Thus change comes on me. If the light
1163,I.,"Of the gay sun is drank by clouds,"
1164,I.,"And dulness sleeps upon the bright,"
1165,I.,Clear garniture whose greenness shrouds
1166,I.,The naked nature; if the creep
1167,I.,Of lazy rain-clouds tells alone
1168,I.,"Earth does not on its axle sleep,"
1169,I.,And winds go over with a moan
1170,I.,Like birds wing-broken; if the sea
1171,I.,"Looks like an agitated pall,"
1172,I.,"And sullied foam heaves mournfully,"
1173,I.,And pitches from the dull green wall
1174,I.,Of waters; if the wild fowl rise
1175,I.,"From the cold ocean with a plash,"
1176,I.,"And heavily wheel up the skies,"
1177,I.,As if they would forget the dash
1178,I.,"Of billows, and could pass away"
1179,I.,From earthly sorrows as from earth;
1180,I.,"If not one shorn, but sunny ray,"
1181,I.,Leaps out like a stray thought of mirth;
1182,I.,"If heaven looks sad, and seas look dull,"
1183,I.,And nature’s beauty is a blank--
1184,I.,I feel as if my heart were full
1185,I.,Of waters from oblivion drank;
1186,I.,"For I forget, like flowers, the hue"
1187,I.,"Of beauty, without sun and dew."
1188,I.,
1189,I.,But a bright morning--when the lark
1190,I.,"Is painted on the light blue sky,"
1191,I.,"And vapors rest upon the dark,"
1192,I.,Deep pools of ebony that lie
1193,I.,In the hill shadows; when the leaves
1194,I.,"Are stirring with the scented air,"
1195,I.,And the bright drops that evening weaves
1196,I.,Like diamonds in the wavy hair
1197,I.,"Of nature, glisten; when the wing"
1198,I.,Of the light wind is but a shrine
1199,I.,On which the lowliest flower may fling
1200,I.,Its gift of odors; when the vine
1201,I.,Hath lifted its coarse leaf to show
1202,I.,"Its azure clusters to the sun,"
1203,I.,"And quickened by his amorous glow,"
1204,I.,The curling shoots stir one by one;
1205,I.,"When every fibre, blade, and stem"
1206,I.,"That lifteth to the arch of blue,"
1207,I.,"Is jewelled with its droplet gem,"
1208,I.,And every bathed and dainty hue
1209,I.,Hath a clear April freshness; when
1210,I.,The birds go caroling like streams
1211,I.,"O’er pebbly courses, and the glen"
1212,I.,Reechoes patiently the themes
1213,I.,A thousand summers and their birds
1214,I.,Have given in those very words;
1215,I.,"When every nerve is nobly strung,"
1216,I.,"And leaping pulses swiftly pass,"
1217,I.,And care is from the spirit flung
1218,I.,Like rain-drops from the swaying grass--
1219,I.,I feel as if my spirit took
1220,I.,"From nature a new gift of sight,"
1221,I.,And I could read her living book
1222,I.,"By perfect and immediate light,"
1223,I.,"And knew, as angels know, how broad"
1224,I.,Is the benevolence of God.
1225,I.,
1226,I.,
1227,II.,II.
1228,II.,
1229,II.,It is a glorious morning. Storm
1230,II.,"Hath left no traces, and the warm,"
1231,II.,Rich sunshine cometh like a strain
1232,II.,"Of parted music, back again."
1233,II.,"The trees are bare, but like a true"
1234,II.,"And changeless friend, the sun shines through,"
1235,II.,And round the sad and fallen leaves
1236,II.,His mesh of light he softly weaves.
1237,II.,I see and feel how very fair
1238,II.,"This summer sun, and breezes are;"
1239,II.,"I see the white, thin vapors wreathed"
1240,II.,About the hills as if they breathed;
1241,II.,"I see the sky’s pure, delicate blue,"
1242,II.,"Like a soft eye which melts me through,"
1243,II.,And I’ve remembered the sweet eyes
1244,II.,"I likened to those gentle skies,"
1245,II.,And gazed this hour as if their look
1246,II.,"Were written in that azure book,"
1247,II.,And the long echo came but now
1248,II.,Of my hot speech and silly vow.
1249,II.,I cannot wander; but I know
1250,II.,How earth’s deep voices softly flow;
1251,II.,I know how light the waters run
1252,II.,O’er the sere grass and fretful stone;
1253,II.,"I know how fountains leap, how still"
1254,II.,The winds creep over lake and hill;
1255,II.,"The Autumn birds, the last leaf-fall,"
1256,II.,The morn’s sweet breath--I know them all.
1257,II.,
1258,II.,I know them all--and yet my feet
1259,II.,Are not where singing waters meet;
1260,II.,"My books are for the running streams,"
1261,II.,And stupid schoolmen for the dreams
1262,II.,Of gentle spirits; I am tied
1263,II.,While nature joyeth like a bride;
1264,II.,"Chained down to reason on the cool,"
1265,II.,"Dull precepts of a skeptic’s rule,"
1266,II.,While beauty over earth and sea
1267,II.,Is gushing as a fount let free.
1268,II.,
1269,II.,It hath its lesson. Beautiful things
1270,II.,Are given like retreating wings;
1271,II.,"Not to be gathered, never won,"
1272,II.,But sent to lead the spirit on;
1273,II.,"Winning the upward eye of prayer,"
1274,II.,"As ’twere a finger pointing there,"
1275,II.,Till we have followed to the sky
1276,II.,"An angel, imperceptibly."
1277,II.,
1278,II.,
1279,III.,III.
1280,III.,
1281,III.,It is a holy night. The moon
1282,III.,"Hath made it like a gentler noon,"
1283,III.,And every deep and starry eye
1284,III.,"Is waking in the summer sky,"
1285,III.,As if its light were made alone
1286,III.,For restless hearts to gaze upon.
1287,III.,"There are no voices, and the stir"
1288,III.,Of the soft south goes lightlier
1289,III.,"Among the branches, and the deep,"
1290,III.,"Felt stillness of a world asleep,"
1291,III.,Is on my spirit like the touch
1292,III.,Of a sweet friend who loveth much.
1293,III.,I’ve left my books. I cannot damp
1294,III.,My heart beside a weary lamp
1295,III.,"While heaven is set with stars, and I"
1296,III.,"Am not to sit down quietly,"
1297,III.,And on a musty altar fling
1298,III.,The birthright of a glorious wing.
1299,III.,Reason who will; while skies of June
1300,III.,"Are molten by this silent moon,"
1301,III.,"While flowers have breath, and voices creep"
1302,III.,"From running brook and fountain-leap,"
1303,III.,While any thing is left to love
1304,III.,"In this fair earth and heaven above,"
1305,III.,I would not wear a fettered limb
1306,III.,To make Chaldea’s wisdom dim.
1307,III.,
1308,III.,"Why, what is duty? Sky and sea,"
1309,III.,Thou promised heaven! are types of thee;
1310,III.,The earth is like a flowing cup
1311,III.,Of perfect beauty mingled up;
1312,III.,"The very elements of heaven,"
1313,III.,"Life, light, and music, freely given;"
1314,III.,"The world an Eden, and we thirst"
1315,III.,For every voice and fountain-burst;
1316,III.,"And yet, we’re told, at duty’s call"
1317,III.,We must forego--forget them all!
1318,III.,
1319,III.,How has the foot of nature trod
1320,III.,"The pathway of a perfect God,"
1321,III.,How are the springs of earnest thought
1322,III.,"With his diviner cunning wrought,"
1323,III.,If all that makes us feel our fate
1324,III.,Not altogether desolate--
1325,III.,"This burning love for beautiful things,"
1326,III.,"Is sealed among forbidden springs,"
1327,III.,And we must throw a gift of fire
1328,III.,Aside like a neglected lyre?
1329,III.,
1330,III.,

1333,BETTER MOMENTS.,BETTER MOMENTS.
1334,BETTER MOMENTS.,
1335,BETTER MOMENTS.,
1336,BETTER MOMENTS.,My mother’s voice! how often creeps
1337,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Its cadence on my lonely hours,"
1338,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Like healing sent on wings of sleep,"
1339,BETTER MOMENTS.,Or dew to the unconscious flowers!
1340,BETTER MOMENTS.,
1341,BETTER MOMENTS.,I can forget her melting prayer
1342,BETTER MOMENTS.,While leaping pulses madly fly;
1343,BETTER MOMENTS.,"But in the still unbroken air,"
1344,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Her gentle tone comes stealing by,"
1345,BETTER MOMENTS.,"And years, and sin, and manhood flee,"
1346,BETTER MOMENTS.,And leave me at my mother’s knee.
1347,BETTER MOMENTS.,
1348,BETTER MOMENTS.,"The book of nature, and the print"
1349,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Of beauty on the whispering sea,"
1350,BETTER MOMENTS.,Give aye to me some lineament
1351,BETTER MOMENTS.,Of what I have been taught to be.
1352,BETTER MOMENTS.,"My heart is harder, and perhaps"
1353,BETTER MOMENTS.,"My manliness hath drunk up tears,"
1354,BETTER MOMENTS.,And there’s a mildew in the lapse
1355,BETTER MOMENTS.,Of a few miserable years--
1356,BETTER MOMENTS.,But nature’s book is even yet
1357,BETTER MOMENTS.,With all my mother’s lessons writ.
1358,BETTER MOMENTS.,
1359,BETTER MOMENTS.,I have been out at eventide
1360,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Beneath a moonlight sky of spring,"
1361,BETTER MOMENTS.,"When earth was garnished like a bride,"
1362,BETTER MOMENTS.,And night had on her silver wing;
1363,BETTER MOMENTS.,"When bursting leaves and diamond grass,"
1364,BETTER MOMENTS.,"And waters leaping to the light,"
1365,BETTER MOMENTS.,And all that makes the pulses pass
1366,BETTER MOMENTS.,"With wilder fleetness, thronged the night--"
1367,BETTER MOMENTS.,"When all was beauty--then have I,"
1368,BETTER MOMENTS.,With friends on whom my love is flung
1369,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Like myrrh on winds of Araby,"
1370,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Gazed up where evening’s lamp is hung,"
1371,BETTER MOMENTS.,And when the beautiful spirit there
1372,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Flung over me its golden chain,"
1373,BETTER MOMENTS.,My mother’s voice came on the air
1374,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Like the light dropping of the rain,"
1375,BETTER MOMENTS.,And resting on some silver star
1376,BETTER MOMENTS.,"The spirit of a bended knee,"
1377,BETTER MOMENTS.,I’ve poured her low and fervent prayer
1378,BETTER MOMENTS.,That our eternity might be
1379,BETTER MOMENTS.,"To rise in heaven like stars at night,"
1380,BETTER MOMENTS.,And tread a living path of light!
1381,BETTER MOMENTS.,
1382,BETTER MOMENTS.,I have been on the dewy hills
1383,BETTER MOMENTS.,"When night was stealing from the dawn,"
1384,BETTER MOMENTS.,"And mist was on the waking rills,"
1385,BETTER MOMENTS.,And tints were delicately drawn
1386,BETTER MOMENTS.,In the gray east; when birds were waking
1387,BETTER MOMENTS.,"With a low murmur in the trees,"
1388,BETTER MOMENTS.,And melody by fits was breaking
1389,BETTER MOMENTS.,Upon the whisper of the breeze--
1390,BETTER MOMENTS.,"And this when I was forth, perchance,"
1391,BETTER MOMENTS.,As a worn reveller from the dance!
1392,BETTER MOMENTS.,And when the sun sprang gloriously
1393,BETTER MOMENTS.,"And freely up, and hill and river"
1394,BETTER MOMENTS.,Were catching upon wave and tree
1395,BETTER MOMENTS.,The arrows from his subtle quiver--
1396,BETTER MOMENTS.,"I say a voice has thrilled me then,"
1397,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Heard on the still and rushing light,"
1398,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Or creeping from the silent glen,"
1399,BETTER MOMENTS.,Like words from the departing night--
1400,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Hath stricken me, and I have pressed"
1401,BETTER MOMENTS.,"On the wet grass my fevered brow,"
1402,BETTER MOMENTS.,"And pouring forth the earliest,"
1403,BETTER MOMENTS.,"First prayer with which I learned to bow,"
1404,BETTER MOMENTS.,Have felt my mother’s spirit rush
1405,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Upon me as in by-past years,"
1406,BETTER MOMENTS.,And yielding to the blessed gush
1407,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Of my ungovernable tears,"
1408,BETTER MOMENTS.,"Have risen up--the gay, the wild--"
1409,BETTER MOMENTS.,As humble as a very child!
1410,BETTER MOMENTS.,
1411,BETTER MOMENTS.,
1412,BETTER MOMENTS.,
1413,BETTER MOMENTS.,
1414,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,THE HINDOO MOTHER.
1415,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,
1416,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,
1417,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,It was a gentle eve in Hindoostan.
1418,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"The rains were past, and the delighted earth"
1419,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Was beautiful once more, and glittering leaves"
1420,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Were lifting lightly on their beaten stems,"
1421,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And glancing to the pure, transparent sky,"
1422,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Like a pleased infant smiling through its tears.
1423,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Clouds lingered in the west, and tints were drawn"
1424,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"By sunset fingers on their skirts of gold,"
1425,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And they were floating as serenely there,"
1426,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,As if the children of the restless storm
1427,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Could sleep upon the azure floor of heaven.
1428,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,
1429,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Deep ran the holy Ganges, for the rain"
1430,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Had swollen it from Thibet to the sea.
1431,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Its flow was turbid; and, as if the winds"
1432,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Were not forgotten by the multitude
1433,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Of its strange waters, they were leaping up,"
1434,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,And with a wonderous glory gathering
1435,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,The mantle of the sunset over them.
1436,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,How frequently these living passages
1437,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Of nature’s book are opened, and how few"
1438,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Are the high hearts that know them, and can feel"
1439,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Their eloquence and beauty!
1440,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,
1441,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Meina stood
1442,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Upon the breathing carpet of the shore,"
1443,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Gazing on sky and river. There was much
1444,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"In the dark features of the young Hindoo,"
1445,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,That should have won a gentler history.
1446,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"She had the Eastern eye, with its dark fringe"
1447,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And shadowy depth of lustre; but, beyond"
1448,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"The elements of beauty, there was writ"
1449,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,A something that the wounded roe would trust
1450,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,For shelter from its hunters. Her closed lips
1451,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Were delicate as the tinted pencilling
1452,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Of veins upon a flower; and on her cheek
1453,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"The timid blood had faintly melted through,"
1454,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Like something that was half afraid of light.
1455,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,There was no slighter print upon the grass
1456,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Than her elastic step; and in her frame
1457,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"There was a perfect symmetry, that seemed"
1458,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Aerial as a bird’s. It was the hour
1459,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"For worship in her land; and she had come,"
1460,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"With the religion of a high, pure heart,"
1461,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,To bow herself in prayer. A darker mind
1462,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Might pray at such an hour; but she had caught
1463,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"The spirit of the scene; and, as her eye"
1464,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Followed the coursing of the golden waves,"
1465,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Or rested on the clouds that slept above,"
1466,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Like isles upon the bosom of the sea,"
1467,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Her soul was swept to music like a harp,"
1468,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,And she knelt down in her deep blessedness
1469,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"To worship the High Maker. As she prayed,"
1470,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Her beautiful young boy--a very dream,"
1471,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"As he might be, of infant loveliness,"
1472,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"With his dark hair upon the summer wind,"
1473,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,And the sweet laugh of a delighted child
1474,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Like music on his lips--came leaping by,"
1475,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And, flinging a light wreath upon her brow,"
1476,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Sprang onward like a bounding antelope.
1477,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"She turned a moment--might she not, for him?"
1478,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Him, whom she cradled in the whispering tree,"
1479,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,And gathered to her bosom in the hush
1480,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Of the still night?--to know if he was there.
1481,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Twas but a moment, and she bowed again;"
1482,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And, as the murmur of her silver tone"
1483,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Stole out upon the wind, her images"
1484,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Of majesty came back, and she was filled,"
1485,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Like a deep channel by the whirlwind swept,"
1486,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Again with the rich rushing of her prayer.
1487,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,The shadows of the stealthy evening came
1488,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Silently on; but she was up, in thought,"
1489,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Among the crystal palaces of light;
1490,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And a still prompting came to her, to pray"
1491,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"That the poor spirit of a passing world,"
1492,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"With all its fond, but frail idolatries,"
1493,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Might on the altar of her God be flung.
1494,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"She breathed it, and along the holy shore"
1495,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,She heard the whisper of the waters creep:
1496,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"‘Thine is the victory, Meina!’--Was it won?"
1497,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Won in its cold, bereaving cruelty?"
1498,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Won from the pride of woman? from her love?
1499,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Won from thy boy! young mother? No! oh, no!"
1500,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"She had forgotten him! He was too young,"
1501,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Too purely, beautifully young, to die!"
1502,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And then the waves repeated to the shore,"
1503,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,And the light echo heard it: ‘Give him up!’
1504,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,And Meina heard it: ‘Give him to thy God!’
1505,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,And the strong heart arose! One arrowy pulse
1506,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Of an acuter agony than death;
1507,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"One fearful shiver at the searching thrill,"
1508,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And she had won--aye, with her glorious boy"
1509,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Upon her very breast--the victory!
1510,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Oh! let the erring oftener be forgiven,"
1511,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"That, in the shadowy twilight of the mind,"
1512,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,They stray a little from the perfect way!
1513,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"If there is evidence in silent leaves,"
1514,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And the still waters, of a present God,"
1515,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And all who hear not messages of grace,"
1516,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Must gather from its dim and hidden words
1517,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Their better solaces; remember ye
1518,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Who reckon lightly of the poor Hindoo,"
1519,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"That, in the scattering of the leaves of life,"
1520,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,His page was written more imperfectly.
1521,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,
1522,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"The beautiful sun arose, and there was not"
1523,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,A stain upon the sky; the virgin blue
1524,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Was delicate as light; and, as the east"
1525,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Eclipsed night’s pale and starry jewelry,"
1526,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"The pure intensity of noon stole on,"
1527,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Like the soft deepening of a northern eye.
1528,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,
1529,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"‘Come! my own glorious boy!’ and forth he sprang,"
1530,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,As he had been created of the morn
1531,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,A spirit and an element of light.
1532,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,‘Come! Come!’ and he was bounding airily
1533,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Beside his stately mother, laughing out"
1534,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"His lisping prattle of the promised boat,"
1535,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"As if her words had been in playfulness,"
1536,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,‘That the bright waves should float him on to heaven.’
1537,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"The morning mist stole up, as Meina knelt"
1538,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,To offer him to God. Her eyes were dim;
1539,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"But her fine forehead, and her calm, still lip,"
1540,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Were fearfully subdued; and as the cloud
1541,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Which clothes the lightning slumbers, so they slept."
1542,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Her soul was in its strength. She held her boy
1543,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Upon her bosom, till she felt the throb"
1544,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Of his warm pulses numbered on her heart,"
1545,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And her low, leaden cadences, kept on!"
1546,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"His silken hair, as delicately soft"
1547,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"As the light wind that stirred it, floated up,"
1548,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,As if to plead at her transparent cheek;
1549,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,But she had wooed its kisses till it came
1550,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"To be a fond idolatry, and now"
1551,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,She nerved her as the strong heart answered it.
1552,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And the low words broke severally on,"
1553,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Distinctly as a common orison!
1554,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,There is a period in the wreck of hopes
1555,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"By the affections garnered, calmer far"
1556,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Than an untried serenity. It comes
1557,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"With the stern conflict ever, and awaits"
1558,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"The passage of that hour, as if the soul"
1559,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Were girded, and had championed suffering;"

1564,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,
1565,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"The low ‘Amen!’ died on the silent air,"

1569,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,The painted boat heave lightly to the swell
1570,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Upon the reedy shore, and caught the breath"
1571,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Of her wreathed helm of flowers, he gave a shout,"

1574,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,He bounded to implore that she would come.
1575,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Calmly and steadily came Meina on,"
1576,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Led by her victim boy. The boat was there
1577,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Among the tall wet reeds, and she went in"
1578,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And scanned its light frame over, and arranged"
1579,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Its mimic ornaments; and then again,"
1580,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"When she had seen it all, and he had grown"
1581,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Impatient, she began to note once more"
1582,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"The frailties in its lightly plaited reeds,"
1583,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,As if she did not know that it was meant

1588,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,As if it half misgave that all was wrong.
1589,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,
1590,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,‘Come!’ and he sprang into his mother’s arms
1591,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"With a light leap, and, scarcely faltering"
1592,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"In his gay laugh, he looked into her face,"
1593,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And in a tone of fondness whispered her,"
1594,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"‘Will the boat bear, dear mother?’ She had quelled"
1595,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Her feelings until now; had nerved herself
1596,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,To the light grace with which he bounded by;
1597,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Had heard his voice, and looked upon his hair"
1598,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"In its light, breezy floatings, and had shut"

1600,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"But this one doubt, half sadness as it came"
1601,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"From his delighted lips, and with his look"
1602,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Of childlike and appealing confidence,"
1603,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Was keener than a mother’s heart could bear!
1604,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"She bowed her head, and struggled, as if life"
1605,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Were bursting from its seal; and, as the thought"
1606,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Rushed over her to take her idol back,"
1607,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"And keep him for her God, he murmured low,"
1608,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"‘And are you sure, my mother?’--‘No! my son!’"
1609,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,And the strong tide of nature gathered back
1610,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,With a resistless energy. She clasped
1611,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Her boy convulsively, and he had lived"
1612,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"To quicken, in its gifted elements,"
1613,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"The radiant spirit written on his brow,"
1614,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"But a high strengthening she knew not of,"
1615,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Awakened her, and pressing down her lips"

1617,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"She hushed him into peace, and lifting up"
1618,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Her face to heaven, she breathed the name of God,"
1619,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,And laid him down--for ever!
1620,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,
1621,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,The light bark
1622,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Went smoothly with the tide, and floated on"
1623,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,Till his dark eye was scarcely visible.
1624,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"On, and yet on, she bounded! The bright waves"
1625,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Seemed playful in their leaping joyousness,"
1626,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,And the curled ripple feathered at the prow

1630,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,With her quick undulations! Hope revived

1635,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,A cadence of his sweet and silvery voice
1636,THE HINDOO MOTHER.,"Like a delighted shouting. It died off,"
