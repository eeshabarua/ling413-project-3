42,PREFACE.,
43,PREFACE.,
44,PREFACE.,I am constantly urged by readers and impersonators to furnish them with
45,PREFACE.,verses for recitation. In response to this ever-increasing demand I have
46,PREFACE.,"selected, for this volume, the poems which seem suitable for such a"
47,PREFACE.,purpose.
48,PREFACE.,
49,PREFACE.,"In making my collection I have been obliged to use, not those which are"
50,PREFACE.,"among my best efforts in a literary or artistic sense, but those which"
51,PREFACE.,contain the best dramatic possibilities for professionals. Several of
52,PREFACE.,"the poems are among my earliest efforts, others were written expressly"
53,PREFACE.,"for this book. In “Meg’s Curse,” which has never before been in print,"
54,PREFACE.,"and in several others, I ignored all rules of art for the purpose of"
55,PREFACE.,giving the public reader a better chance to exercise his elocutionary
56,PREFACE.,powers.

135,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"The gate was thrown open, I rode out alone,"
136,HOW SALVATOR WON.,More proud than a monarch who sits on a throne.
137,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"I am but a jockey, yet shout upon shout"
138,HOW SALVATOR WON.,Went up from the people who watched me ride out;
139,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"And the cheers that rang forth from that warm-hearted crowd,"
140,HOW SALVATOR WON.,Were as earnest as those to which monarch e’er bowed.
141,HOW SALVATOR WON.,
142,HOW SALVATOR WON.,My heart thrilled with pleasure so keen it was pain
143,HOW SALVATOR WON.,As I patted my Salvator’s soft silken mane;
144,HOW SALVATOR WON.,And a sweet shiver shot from his hide to my hand
145,HOW SALVATOR WON.,As we passed by the multitude down to the stand.
146,HOW SALVATOR WON.,
147,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"The great waves of cheering came billowing back,"
148,HOW SALVATOR WON.,As the hoofs of brave Tenny rang swift down the track;
149,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"And he stood there beside us, all bone and all muscle,"
150,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"Our noble opponent, well trained for the tussle"
151,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"That waited us there on the smooth, shining course."
152,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"My Salvator, fair to the lovers of horse,"
153,HOW SALVATOR WON.,As a beautiful woman is fair to man’s sight--
154,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"Pure type of the thoroughbred, clean-limbed and bright,--"

156,HOW SALVATOR WON.,And nothing at all unexpected or new.
157,HOW SALVATOR WON.,
158,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"And then, there before us the bright flag is spread,"
159,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"There’s a roar from the grand stand, and Tenny’s ahead;"
160,HOW SALVATOR WON.,At the sound of the voices that shouted “a go!”
161,HOW SALVATOR WON.,He sprang like an arrow shot straight from the bow.
162,HOW SALVATOR WON.,I tighten the reins on Prince Charlie’s great son--
163,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"He is off like a rocket, the race is begun."
164,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"Half-way down the furlong, their heads are together,"
165,HOW SALVATOR WON.,Scarce room ’twixt their noses to wedge in a feather;
166,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"Past grand stand, and judges, in neck-to-neck strife,"
167,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"Ah, Salvator, boy! ’tis the race of your life."
168,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"I press my knees closer, I coax him, I urge,"
169,HOW SALVATOR WON.,I feel him go out with a leap and a surge;
170,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"I see him creep on, inch by inch, stride by stride,"
171,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"While backward, still backward, falls Tenny beside."
172,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"We are nearing the turn, the first quarter is past--"
173,HOW SALVATOR WON.,’Twixt leader and chaser the daylight is cast.
174,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"The distance elongates, still Tenny sweeps on,"

176,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"His awkwardness vanished, his muscles all strained--"
177,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"A noble opponent, well born and well trained."
178,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"I glanced o’er my shoulder, ha! Tenny, the cost"
179,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"Of that one second’s flagging, will be--the race lost."
180,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"One second’s weak yielding of courage and strength,"
181,HOW SALVATOR WON.,And the daylight between us has doubled its length.
182,HOW SALVATOR WON.,
183,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"The first mile is covered, the race is mine--no!"
184,HOW SALVATOR WON.,For the blue blood of Tenny responds to a blow.
185,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"He shoots through the air like a ball from a gun,"
186,HOW SALVATOR WON.,And the two lengths between us are shortened to one.
187,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"My heart is contracted, my throat feels a lump,"
188,HOW SALVATOR WON.,For Tenny’s long neck is at Salvator’s rump;
189,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"And now with new courage, grown bolder and bolder,"
190,HOW SALVATOR WON.,I see him once more running shoulder to shoulder.
191,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"With knees, hands and body I press my grand steed;"
192,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"I urge him, I coax him, I pray him to heed!"
193,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"Oh, Salvator! Salvator! list to my calls,"
194,HOW SALVATOR WON.,For the blow of my whip will hurt both if it falls.
195,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"There’s a roar from the crowd like the ocean in storm,"
196,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"As close to my saddle leaps Tenny’s great form,"
197,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"One more mighty plunge, and with knee, limb and hand,"
198,HOW SALVATOR WON.,I lift my horse first by a nose past the stand.
199,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"We are under the string now--the great race is done,"
200,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"And Salvator, Salvator, Salvator won!"
201,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"Cheer, hoar-headed patriarchs; cheer loud, I say:"
202,HOW SALVATOR WON.,’Tis the race of a century witnessed to-day!
203,HOW SALVATOR WON.,Though ye live twice the space that’s allotted to men
204,HOW SALVATOR WON.,Ye never will see such a grand race again.
205,HOW SALVATOR WON.,Let the shouts of the populace roar like the surf
206,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"For Salvator, Salvator, king of the turf!"
207,HOW SALVATOR WON.,He has broken the record of thirteen long years;
208,HOW SALVATOR WON.,He has won the first place in a vast line of peers.
209,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"’Twas a neck-to-neck contest, a grand, honest race,"
210,HOW SALVATOR WON.,And even his enemies grant him his place.
211,HOW SALVATOR WON.,"Down into the dust let old records be hurled,"

221,THE GOSSIPS.,Was hanging her head through the long golden hours;
222,THE GOSSIPS.,"And early one morning I saw her tears falling,"
223,THE GOSSIPS.,And heard a low gossiping talk in the bowers.
224,THE GOSSIPS.,"The yellow Nasturtium, a spinster all faded,"
225,THE GOSSIPS.,Was telling a Lily what ailed the poor Rose:
226,THE GOSSIPS.,"“That wild roving Bee who was hanging about her,"
227,THE GOSSIPS.,"Has jilted her squarely, as everyone knows."
228,THE GOSSIPS.,
229,THE GOSSIPS.,"“I knew when he came, with his singing and sighing,"
230,THE GOSSIPS.,"His airs and his speeches so fine and so sweet,"
231,THE GOSSIPS.,"Just how it would end; but no one would believe me,"
232,THE GOSSIPS.,For all were quite ready to fall at his feet.”
233,THE GOSSIPS.,"“Indeed, you are wrong,” said the Lily-belle proudly;"
234,THE GOSSIPS.,"“I cared nothing for him, he called on me once,"
235,THE GOSSIPS.,"And would have come often, no doubt, if I’d asked him,"
236,THE GOSSIPS.,"But, though he was handsome, I thought him a dunce.”"
237,THE GOSSIPS.,
238,THE GOSSIPS.,"“Now, now, that’s not true,” cried the tall Oleander."
239,THE GOSSIPS.,“He has traveled and seen every flower that grows;
240,THE GOSSIPS.,"And one who has supped in the garden of princes,"
241,THE GOSSIPS.,We all might have known would not wed with the Rose.”
242,THE GOSSIPS.,“But wasn’t she proud when he showed her attention?
243,THE GOSSIPS.,"And she let him caress her,” said sly Mignonette;"
244,THE GOSSIPS.,"“And I used to see it and blush for her folly,"
245,THE GOSSIPS.,The silly thing thinks he will come to her yet.”
246,THE GOSSIPS.,
247,THE GOSSIPS.,"“I thought he was splendid,” said pretty pert Larkspur,"
248,THE GOSSIPS.,"“So dark, and so grand with that gay cloak of gold;"
249,THE GOSSIPS.,"But he tried once to kiss me, the impudent fellow!"
250,THE GOSSIPS.,And I got offended; I thought him too bold.”
251,THE GOSSIPS.,"“Oh, fie!” laughed the Almond, “that does for a story."
252,THE GOSSIPS.,"Though I hang down my head, yet I see all that goes;"
253,THE GOSSIPS.,"And I saw you reach out trying hard to detain him,"
254,THE GOSSIPS.,But he just tapped your cheek and flew by to the Rose.
255,THE GOSSIPS.,
256,THE GOSSIPS.,"“He cared nothing for her, he only was flirting"
257,THE GOSSIPS.,"To while away time, as I very well knew;"
258,THE GOSSIPS.,"So I turned a cold shoulder on all his advances,"
259,THE GOSSIPS.,Because I was certain his heart was untrue.”
260,THE GOSSIPS.,“The Rose is served right for her folly in trusting
261,THE GOSSIPS.,"An oily-tongued stranger,” quoth proud Columbine."
262,THE GOSSIPS.,"“I knew what he was, and thought once I would warn her,"
263,THE GOSSIPS.,But of course the affair was no business of mine.”
264,THE GOSSIPS.,
265,THE GOSSIPS.,"“Oh, well,” cried the Peony, shrugging her shoulders,"
266,THE GOSSIPS.,“I saw all along that the Bee was a flirt;
267,THE GOSSIPS.,"But the Rose has been always so praised and so petted,"
268,THE GOSSIPS.,I thought a good lesson would do her no hurt.”
269,THE GOSSIPS.,"Just then came the sound of a love-song sung sweetly,"
270,THE GOSSIPS.,I saw my proud Rose lifting up her bowed head;
271,THE GOSSIPS.,"And the talk of the gossips was hushed in a moment,"
272,THE GOSSIPS.,And the flowers all listened to hear what was said.
273,THE GOSSIPS.,
274,THE GOSSIPS.,"And the dark, handsome Bee, with his cloak o’er his shoulder,"
275,THE GOSSIPS.,"Came swift through the sunlight and kissed the sad Rose,"

491,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,I’ve a thousand things to write you

497,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,That I am engaged to Joe;
498,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,"She thinks I am rather erratic,"
499,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,And feared that I might say “no.”
500,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,"But, Mabel, I’m twenty-seven"
501,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,"(Though nobody _dreams_ it, dear),"
502,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,And a fortune like Joe’s isn’t given

509,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,But that was my very first season--
510,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,"And Harry was poor as could be,"
511,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,And mamma’s good practical reason

513,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,
514,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,"She whisked me off over the ocean,"

525,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,"Away from the music’s pulsation,"
526,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,Away from the lights and the dance.
527,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,And the wind o’er the wild prairie

529,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,"And it seemed not Joe, but Harry"
530,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,Who was standing there close to me.
531,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,
532,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,And the funniest feverish feeling
533,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,"Went up from my feet to my head,"

541,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,"Maybe ’twas the scent of the flowers,"
542,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,"That heavy with fragrance bloomed near,"

545,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.,Write soon to your fortunate Clara

684,THE PHANTOM BALL.,"Oh, ’twas a ghastly picture!"

691,THE PHANTOM BALL.,"As they danced, their dry bones rattled"

698,THE PHANTOM BALL.,"Some of them wore their face-cloths,"

735,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,
736,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,Then we came to a valley more tropical far
737,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,"Than the wonderful vale of Cashmere,"
738,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,And I saw from a bower a face like a flower
739,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,Smile out on the gay Cavalier.
740,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,And he said: “We have come to humanity’s goal:
741,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,Here love and delight are intense.”
742,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,But alas and alas! for the hopes of my soul--
743,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,It was only the “Kingdom of Sense.”
744,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,
745,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,As I journeyed more slowly I met on the road
746,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,A coach with retainers behind.
747,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,"And they said: “Follow me, for our Lady’s abode"
748,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,"Belongs in that realm, you will find.”"
749,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,"’Twas a grand dame of fashion, a newly-made bride,"
750,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,"I followed, encouraged and bold;"
751,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,"But my hopes died away like the last gleams of day,"
752,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,For we came to the “Kingdom of Gold.”
753,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,
754,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,At the door of a cottage I asked a fair maid.
755,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,"“I have heard of that realm,” she replied;"
756,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,"“But my feet never roam from the ‘Kingdom of Home,’"
757,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,"So I know not the way,” and she sighed."
758,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,I looked on the cottage; how restful it seemed!
759,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE.,And the maid was as fair as a dove.

902,TWO SINNERS.,TWO SINNERS.
903,TWO SINNERS.,
904,TWO SINNERS.,
905,TWO SINNERS.,"There was a man, it was said one time,"
906,TWO SINNERS.,Who went astray in his youthful prime.
907,TWO SINNERS.,Can the brain keep cool and the heart keep quiet
908,TWO SINNERS.,When the blood is a river that’s running riot?
909,TWO SINNERS.,"And boys will be boys, the old folks say,"
910,TWO SINNERS.,And a man is the better who’s had his day.
911,TWO SINNERS.,
912,TWO SINNERS.,The sinner reformed; and the preacher told
913,TWO SINNERS.,Of the prodigal son who came back to the fold.
914,TWO SINNERS.,"And Christian people threw open the door,"
915,TWO SINNERS.,With a warmer welcome than ever before.
916,TWO SINNERS.,"Wealth and honor were his to command,"
917,TWO SINNERS.,And a spotless woman gave him her hand.
918,TWO SINNERS.,
919,TWO SINNERS.,"And the world strewed their pathway with blossoms abloom,"
920,TWO SINNERS.,"Crying, “God bless layde, and God bless groom!”"
921,TWO SINNERS.,
922,TWO SINNERS.,"There was a maiden who went astray,"
923,TWO SINNERS.,In the golden dawn of her life’s young day.
924,TWO SINNERS.,"She had more passion and heart than head,"
925,TWO SINNERS.,And she followed blindly where fond Love led.
926,TWO SINNERS.,And Love unchecked is a dangerous guide
927,TWO SINNERS.,To wander at will by a fair girl’s side.
928,TWO SINNERS.,
929,TWO SINNERS.,"The woman repented and turned from sin,"
930,TWO SINNERS.,But no door opened to let her in.
931,TWO SINNERS.,"The preacher prayed that she might be forgiven,"
932,TWO SINNERS.,But told her to look for mercy--in heaven
933,TWO SINNERS.,"For this is the law of the earth, we know:"
934,TWO SINNERS.,"That the woman is stoned, while the man may go."
935,TWO SINNERS.,
936,TWO SINNERS.,"A brave man wedded her after all,"
937,TWO SINNERS.,"But the world said, frowning, “We shall not call.”"

942,MEG’S CURSE.,MEG’S CURSE.
943,MEG’S CURSE.,
944,MEG’S CURSE.,
945,MEG’S CURSE.,The sun rode high in a cloudless sky
946,MEG’S CURSE.,Of a perfect summer morn.
947,MEG’S CURSE.,"She stood and gazed out into the street,"
948,MEG’S CURSE.,And wondered why she was born.
949,MEG’S CURSE.,On the topmost branch of a maple-tree
950,MEG’S CURSE.,"That close by the window grew,"
951,MEG’S CURSE.,A robin called to his mate enthralled:
952,MEG’S CURSE.,"“I love but you, but you, but you.”"
953,MEG’S CURSE.,
954,MEG’S CURSE.,A soft look came in her hardened face--
955,MEG’S CURSE.,She had not wept for years;
956,MEG’S CURSE.,"But the robin’s trill, as some sounds will,"
957,MEG’S CURSE.,Jarred open the door of tears.
958,MEG’S CURSE.,She thought of the old home far away;
959,MEG’S CURSE.,She heard the whir-r-r of the mill;
960,MEG’S CURSE.,"She heard the turtle’s wild, sweet call,"
961,MEG’S CURSE.,"And the wail of the whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will."
962,MEG’S CURSE.,
963,MEG’S CURSE.,She saw again that dusty road
964,MEG’S CURSE.,Whence he came riding down;
965,MEG’S CURSE.,She smelled once more the flower she wore
966,MEG’S CURSE.,In the breast of her simple gown.
967,MEG’S CURSE.,Out on the new-mown meadow she heard
968,MEG’S CURSE.,"Two blue-jays quarrel and fret,"
969,MEG’S CURSE.,And the warning cry of a Phœbe bird:
970,MEG’S CURSE.,"“More wet, more wet, more wet.”"
971,MEG’S CURSE.,
972,MEG’S CURSE.,With a blithe “hello” to the men below
973,MEG’S CURSE.,"Who were spreading the new-mown hay,"
974,MEG’S CURSE.,The rider drew rein at her window-pane--
975,MEG’S CURSE.,How it all came back to-day!
976,MEG’S CURSE.,"How young she was, and how fair she was;"
977,MEG’S CURSE.,What innocence crowned her brow!
978,MEG’S CURSE.,"The future seemed fair, for Love was there--"
979,MEG’S CURSE.,And now--and now--and now.
980,MEG’S CURSE.,
981,MEG’S CURSE.,In a dingy glass on the wall near by
982,MEG’S CURSE.,She gazed on her faded face.
983,MEG’S CURSE.,"“Well, Meg, I declare, what a beauty you are!”"
984,MEG’S CURSE.,"She sneered, “What an angel of grace!"
985,MEG’S CURSE.,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
986,MEG’S CURSE.,What a thing of beauty and grace!”
987,MEG’S CURSE.,She reached out her arms with a moaning sob.
988,MEG’S CURSE.,"“Oh, if I could go back!”"
989,MEG’S CURSE.,"Then, swift and strange, came a sudden change;"
990,MEG’S CURSE.,Her brow grew hard and black.
991,MEG’S CURSE.,
992,MEG’S CURSE.,"“A curse on the day and a curse on that man,"
993,MEG’S CURSE.,"And on all who are his,” she cried."
994,MEG’S CURSE.,"“May he starve and be cold, may he live to be old"
995,MEG’S CURSE.,When all who loved him have died.”
996,MEG’S CURSE.,Her wild voice frightened the robin away
997,MEG’S CURSE.,From the branch by the window-sill;
998,MEG’S CURSE.,"And little he knew as away he flew,"
999,MEG’S CURSE.,Of the memories stirred by his trill.
1000,MEG’S CURSE.,
1001,MEG’S CURSE.,"He called to his mate on the grass below,"
1002,MEG’S CURSE.,"“Follow me,” as he soared on high;"
1003,MEG’S CURSE.,And as mates have done since the world begun
1004,MEG’S CURSE.,"She followed, and asked not why."
1005,MEG’S CURSE.,The dingy room seemed curtained with gloom;
1006,MEG’S CURSE.,Meg shivered with nameless dread.
1007,MEG’S CURSE.,The ghost of her youth and her murdered truth
1008,MEG’S CURSE.,Seemed risen up from the dead.
1009,MEG’S CURSE.,
1010,MEG’S CURSE.,"She hurried out into the noisy street,"
1011,MEG’S CURSE.,For the silence made her afraid;
1012,MEG’S CURSE.,"To flee from thought was all she sought,"
1013,MEG’S CURSE.,She cared not whither she strayed.
1014,MEG’S CURSE.,Still on she pressed in her wild unrest
1015,MEG’S CURSE.,"Up avenues skirting the park,"
1016,MEG’S CURSE.,Where fashion’s throng moved gayly along
1017,MEG’S CURSE.,In Vanity Fair--when hark!
1018,MEG’S CURSE.,
1019,MEG’S CURSE.,"A clatter of hoofs down the stony street,"
1020,MEG’S CURSE.,The snort of a frightened horse
1021,MEG’S CURSE.,"That was running wild, and a laughing child"
1022,MEG’S CURSE.,At play in its very course.
1023,MEG’S CURSE.,With one swift glance Meg saw it all.
1024,MEG’S CURSE.,“_His_ child--my God! _his_ child!”
1025,MEG’S CURSE.,"She cried aloud, as she rushed through the crowd"
1026,MEG’S CURSE.,Like one grown suddenly wild.
1027,MEG’S CURSE.,
1028,MEG’S CURSE.,"There, almost under the iron feet,"
1029,MEG’S CURSE.,"Hemmed in by a passing cart,"
1030,MEG’S CURSE.,Stood the baby boy--the pride and joy
1031,MEG’S CURSE.,Of the man who had broken her heart.
1032,MEG’S CURSE.,Past swooning women and shouting men
1033,MEG’S CURSE.,She fled like a flash of light;
1034,MEG’S CURSE.,With her slender arm she gathered from harm
1035,MEG’S CURSE.,The form of the laughing sprite.
1036,MEG’S CURSE.,
1037,MEG’S CURSE.,The death-shod feet of the mad horse beat
1038,MEG’S CURSE.,Her down on the pavings gray;
1039,MEG’S CURSE.,"But the baby laughed out with a merry shout,"
1040,MEG’S CURSE.,And thought it splendid play.
1041,MEG’S CURSE.,"He pulled her gown and called to her: “Say,"
1042,MEG’S CURSE.,Dit up and do dat some more;
1043,MEG’S CURSE.,Das jus’ ze way my papa play
1044,MEG’S CURSE.,Wiz me on ze nursery floor.”
1045,MEG’S CURSE.,
1046,MEG’S CURSE.,"When the frightened father reached the scene,"
1047,MEG’S CURSE.,His boy looked up and smiled
1048,MEG’S CURSE.,"From the stiffening fold of the arm, death-cold,"
1049,MEG’S CURSE.,"Of Meg, who had died for his child."
1050,MEG’S CURSE.,Oh! idle words are a woman’s curse
1051,MEG’S CURSE.,Who loves as woman can;
1052,MEG’S CURSE.,"For put to the test, she will bare her breast"
1053,MEG’S CURSE.,And die for the sake of the man.

1058,A FABLE.,A FABLE.
1059,A FABLE.,
1060,A FABLE.,
1061,A FABLE.,"Some cawing Crows, a hooting Owl,"
1062,A FABLE.,"A Hawk, a Canary, an old Marsh-Fowl,"
1063,A FABLE.,One day all met together
1064,A FABLE.,To hold a caucus and settle the fate
1065,A FABLE.,"Of a certain bird (without a mate),"
1066,A FABLE.,A bird of another feather.
1067,A FABLE.,
1068,A FABLE.,"“My friends,” said the Owl, with a look most wise,"
1069,A FABLE.,"“The Eagle is soaring too near the skies,"
1070,A FABLE.,In a way that is quite improper;
1071,A FABLE.,"Yet the world is praising her, so I’m told,"
1072,A FABLE.,And I think her actions have grown so bold
1073,A FABLE.,That some of us ought to stop her.”
1074,A FABLE.,
1075,A FABLE.,"“I have heard it said,” quoth Hawk with a sigh,"
1076,A FABLE.,"“That young lambs died at the glance of her eye,"
1077,A FABLE.,And I wholly scorn and despise her.
1078,A FABLE.,"This and more, I am told, they say;"
1079,A FABLE.,And I think that the only proper way
1080,A FABLE.,Is never to recognize her.”
1081,A FABLE.,
1082,A FABLE.,"“I am quite convinced,” said Crow with a caw,"
1083,A FABLE.,“That the Eagle minds no moral law;
1084,A FABLE.,She’s a most unruly creature.”
1085,A FABLE.,"“She’s an ugly thing,” piped Canary Bird;"
1086,A FABLE.,“Some call her handsome; it’s so absurd--
1087,A FABLE.,She hasn’t a decent feature!”
1088,A FABLE.,
1089,A FABLE.,Then the old Marsh Hen went hopping about;
1090,A FABLE.,She said she was sure--she hadn’t a doubt--
1091,A FABLE.,Of the truth of each bird’s story;
1092,A FABLE.,"And she thought it her duty to stop her flight,"
1093,A FABLE.,"To pull her down from her lofty height,"
1094,A FABLE.,And take the gilt from her glory.
1095,A FABLE.,
1096,A FABLE.,"But, lo! from a peak on the mountain grand,"
1097,A FABLE.,"That looks out over the smiling land,"
1098,A FABLE.,"And over the mighty ocean,"
1099,A FABLE.,The Eagle is spreading her splendid wings--
1100,A FABLE.,"She rises, rises, and upward swings,"
1101,A FABLE.,"With a slow, majestic motion."
1102,A FABLE.,
1103,A FABLE.,"Up in the blue of God’s own skies,"
1104,A FABLE.,"With a cry of rapture, away she flies,"
1105,A FABLE.,Close to the Great Eternal.
1106,A FABLE.,She sweeps the world with her piercing sight;
1107,A FABLE.,Her soul is filled with the Infinite
1108,A FABLE.,And the joy of things supernal.
1109,A FABLE.,
1110,A FABLE.,"Thus rise forever the chosen of God,"
1111,A FABLE.,"The genius-crowned or the power-shod,"
1112,A FABLE.,Over the dust-world sailing;
1113,A FABLE.,"And back like splinters blown by the winds,"
1114,A FABLE.,"Must fall the missiles of silly minds,"
1115,A FABLE.,Useless and unavailing.

1154,THE SUICIDE.,
1155,THE SUICIDE.,
1156,THE SUICIDE.,Vast was the wealth I carried in life’s pack--
1157,THE SUICIDE.,"Youth, health, ambition, hope and trust; but Time"
1158,THE SUICIDE.,"And Fate, those robbers fit for any crime,"
1159,THE SUICIDE.,"Stole all, and left me but the empty sack."
1160,THE SUICIDE.,Before me lay a long and lonely track
1161,THE SUICIDE.,Of darkling hills and barren steeps to climb;
1162,THE SUICIDE.,Behind me lay in shadows the sublime
1163,THE SUICIDE.,Lost lands of Love’s delight. Alack! Alack!
1164,THE SUICIDE.,
1165,THE SUICIDE.,"Unwearied, and with springing steps elate,"
1166,THE SUICIDE.,I had conveyed my wealth along the road.
1167,THE SUICIDE.,The empty sack proved now a heavier load:
1168,THE SUICIDE.,I was borne down beneath its worthless weight.
1169,THE SUICIDE.,"I stumbled on, and knocked at Death’s dark gate."
1170,THE SUICIDE.,"There was no answer. Stung by sorrow’s goad,"
1171,THE SUICIDE.,"I _forced_ my way into that grim abode,"
1172,THE SUICIDE.,"And laughed, and flung Life’s empty sack to Fate."
1173,THE SUICIDE.,
1174,THE SUICIDE.,Unknown and uninvited I passed in
1175,THE SUICIDE.,"To that strange land that hangs between two goals,"
1176,THE SUICIDE.,Round which a dark and solemn river rolls--
1177,THE SUICIDE.,More dread its silence than the loud earth’s din.
1178,THE SUICIDE.,"And now, where was the peace I hoped to win?"
1179,THE SUICIDE.,"Black-masted ships slid past me in great shoals,"
1180,THE SUICIDE.,Their bloody decks thronged with mistaken souls.
1181,THE SUICIDE.,(God punishes mistakes sometimes like sin.)
1182,THE SUICIDE.,
1183,THE SUICIDE.,Not rest and not oblivion I found.
1184,THE SUICIDE.,My suffering self dwelt with me just the same;
1185,THE SUICIDE.,"But here no sleep was, and no sweet dreams came"
1186,THE SUICIDE.,"To give me respite. Tyrant Death, uncrowned"
1187,THE SUICIDE.,"By my own hand, still King of Terrors, frowned"
1188,THE SUICIDE.,"Upon my shuddering soul, that shrank in shame"
1189,THE SUICIDE.,"Before those eyes where sorrow blent with blame,"
1190,THE SUICIDE.,And those accusing lips that made no sound.
1191,THE SUICIDE.,
1192,THE SUICIDE.,What gruesome shapes dawned on my startled sight!
1193,THE SUICIDE.,What awful sighs broke on my listening ear!
1194,THE SUICIDE.,"The anguish of the earth, augmented here"
1195,THE SUICIDE.,"A thousand-fold, made one continuous night."
1196,THE SUICIDE.,The sack I flung away in impious spite
1197,THE SUICIDE.,"Hung yet upon me, filled, I saw in fear,"
1198,THE SUICIDE.,"With tears that rained from earth’s adjacent sphere,"
1199,THE SUICIDE.,And turned to stones in falling from that height.
1200,THE SUICIDE.,
1201,THE SUICIDE.,"And close about me pressed a grieving throng,"
1202,THE SUICIDE.,"Each with his heavy sack, which bowed him so"
1203,THE SUICIDE.,His face was hidden. One of these mourned: “Know
1204,THE SUICIDE.,Who enters here but finds the way more long
1205,THE SUICIDE.,To those fair realms where sounds the angels’ song.
1206,THE SUICIDE.,There is no man-made exit out of woe;
1207,THE SUICIDE.,Ye cannot dash the locked door down and go
1208,THE SUICIDE.,To claim thy rightful joy through paths of wrong.”
1209,THE SUICIDE.,
1210,THE SUICIDE.,"He passed into the shadows dim and gray,"
1211,THE SUICIDE.,And left me to pursue my path alone.
1212,THE SUICIDE.,With terror greater than I yet had known.
1213,THE SUICIDE.,"Hard on my soul the awful knowledge lay,"
1214,THE SUICIDE.,Death had not ended life nor found God’s way;
1215,THE SUICIDE.,"But, with my same sad sorrows still my own,"
1216,THE SUICIDE.,"Where by-roads led to by-roads, thistle-sown,"
1217,THE SUICIDE.,I had but wandered off and gone astray.
1218,THE SUICIDE.,
1219,THE SUICIDE.,"With earth still near enough to hear its sighs,"
1220,THE SUICIDE.,"With heaven afar and hell but just below,"
1221,THE SUICIDE.,Still on and on my lonely soul must go
1222,THE SUICIDE.,Until I earn the right to Paradise.
1223,THE SUICIDE.,"We cannot force our way into God’s skies,"
1224,THE SUICIDE.,Nor rush into the rest we long to know;
1225,THE SUICIDE.,"But patiently, with bleeding steps and slow,"

1262,THE MESSENGER.,
1263,THE MESSENGER.,"She rose up in the early dawn,"
1264,THE MESSENGER.,And white and silently she moved
1265,THE MESSENGER.,About the house. Four men had gone
1266,THE MESSENGER.,"To battle for the land they loved,"
1267,THE MESSENGER.,"And she, the mother and the wife,"
1268,THE MESSENGER.,Waited for tidings from the strife.
1269,THE MESSENGER.,How still the house seemed! and her tread
1270,THE MESSENGER.,Was like the footsteps of the dead.
1271,THE MESSENGER.,
1272,THE MESSENGER.,The long day passed; the dark night came.
1273,THE MESSENGER.,She had not seen a human face.
1274,THE MESSENGER.,Some voice spoke suddenly her name.
1275,THE MESSENGER.,"How loud it echoed in that place,"
1276,THE MESSENGER.,"Where, day on day, no sound was heard"
1277,THE MESSENGER.,"But her own footsteps. “Bring you word,”"
1278,THE MESSENGER.,"She cried to whom she could not see,"
1279,THE MESSENGER.,“Word from the battle-plain to me?”
1280,THE MESSENGER.,
1281,THE MESSENGER.,"A soldier entered at the door,"
1282,THE MESSENGER.,And stood within the dim firelight:
1283,THE MESSENGER.,"“I bring you tidings of the four,”"
1284,THE MESSENGER.,"He said, “who left you for the fight.”"
1285,THE MESSENGER.,"“God bless you, friend,” she cried, “speak on!"
1286,THE MESSENGER.,For I can bear it. One is gone?”
1287,THE MESSENGER.,"“Ay, one is gone!” he said. “Which one?”"
1288,THE MESSENGER.,"“Dear lady, he, your eldest son.”"
1289,THE MESSENGER.,
1290,THE MESSENGER.,A deathly pallor shot across
1291,THE MESSENGER.,Her withered face; she did not weep.
1292,THE MESSENGER.,"She said: “It is a grievous loss,"
1293,THE MESSENGER.,But God gives His belovèd sleep.
1294,THE MESSENGER.,What of the living--of the three?
1295,THE MESSENGER.,And when can they come back to me?”
1296,THE MESSENGER.,The soldier turned away his head:
1297,THE MESSENGER.,"“Lady, your husband, too, is dead.”"

1360,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,The angels fell into a strife in heaven.
1361,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1362,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,At length one furious demon grasped the sun
1363,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"And sped away as fast as he could run,"
1364,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"And with a ringing laugh of fiendish mirth,"
1365,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,He leaped the battlements and fell to earth.
1366,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1367,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"Dark was it then in heaven, but light below;"
1368,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"For there the demon wandered to and fro,"

1371,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1372,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,The angels wept and wailed; but through the dark

1376,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1377,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,Then over the battlements there dropped another.
1378,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,(A shrewder angel well there could not be.)
1379,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"Quoth he: “Behold my love for thee, my brother,"

1382,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"“Thy loneliness and wanderings I will share,"

1384,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"“Well said,” the demon answered, “and well done,"

1386,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1387,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"“Your company will cheer me, it is true,"
1388,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,And I could never think of burdening you.”
1389,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"Idly they wandered onward, side by side,"

1391,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1392,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"“Let’s bathe,” the angel suddenly suggested."
1393,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"“Agreed,” the demon answered. “I’ll go last,"

1395,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"This tiresome sun, which I will now make fast.”"
1396,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1397,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"He set the pole well in the sandy turf,"

1400,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,And playfully dared his brother to a race.
1401,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1402,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"They swam around together for awhile,"
1403,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"The demon always keeping near his prize,"
1404,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"Till presently the angel, with a smile,"
1405,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,Proposed a healthful diving exercise.
1406,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1407,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"The demon hesitated. “But,” thought he,"
1408,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,“The jackdaw will inform me with a cry
1409,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,If this good brother tries deceiving me;
1410,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,I will not be outdone by him--not I!”
1411,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1412,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"Down, down they went. The angel in a trice"
1413,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"Rose up again, and swift to shore he sped."
1414,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"The jackdaw shrieked, but lo! a mile of ice"
1415,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,The demon found had frozen o’er his head.
1416,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1417,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"He swore an oath, and gathered all his force,"
1418,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"And broke the ice, to see the sun, of course,"

1420,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,Who sailed away toward the heavenly land.
1421,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,

1426,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1427,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"With bated breath and faces white as ghosts,"
1428,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,Over the walls leaned heaven’s affrighted hosts.
1429,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"Up, up, still up, the angel almost spent,"
1430,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,Threw one foot forward o’er the battlement.
1431,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,
1432,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,The demon seized the other with a shout;
1433,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"So fierce his clutch he pulled the bottom out,"
1434,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"As the good angel, fainting, laid the sun"
1435,A SERVIAN LEGEND.,"Down by the throne of God, who cried: “Well done!"

2531,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,
2532,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"You women lay stress on your fine perception,"
2533,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,Your intuitions are prated about;
2534,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,You claim an occult sort of conception
2535,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,Of matters which men must reason out.
2536,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"So then, of course, when you asked me kindly"
2537,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"“To call again soon,” you read my heart."
2538,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,I cannot believe you were acting blindly;
2539,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,You saw my passion for you from the start.
2540,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,
2541,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,You are one of those women who charm without trying;
2542,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"The clay you are made of is magnet ore,"
2543,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"And I am the steel; yet, there’s no denying"
2544,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,You led me to loving you more and more.
2545,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"You are fanning a flame that may burn too brightly,"
2546,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"Oft easily kindled, but hard to put out;"
2547,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"I am not a man to be played with lightly,"
2548,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,To come at a gesture and go at a pout.
2549,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,
2550,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"A brute you call me, a creature inhuman;"
2551,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"You say I insult you, and bid me go."

2553,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,With thoughts as pure as the drifted snow.
2554,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,Pah! you are but one of a thousand beauties
2555,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,Who think they are living exemplary lives.
2556,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"They break no commandments, and do all their duties"

2558,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,
2559,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"But with drooping of lids, and lifting of faces,"

2562,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"You are mental wantons, who sin with the eyes."
2563,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"You lure love to wake, yet bid it keep under,"
2564,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"You tempt us to fall, but bid reason control;"
2565,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,And then you are full of an outraged wonder
2566,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"When we get to wanting you, body and soul."
2567,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,
2568,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"Why, look at yourself! You were no stranger"

2570,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"When you asked me to call you knew my danger,"
2571,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"Yet here you are, dressed in the gown I admire;"
2572,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,For half of the evil on earth is invented
2573,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"By vain, pretty women with nothing to do"

2583,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,And one thing is certain--you cannot despise me
2584,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"For having been played with, controlled, and dismissed."
2585,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,
2586,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,And the next time you see that a man is attracted
2587,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"By the beauty and graces that are not for him,"
2588,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,Don’t lead him on to be half distracted;
2589,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,Keep out of deep waters although you can swim.
2590,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"For when he is caught in the whirlpool of passion,"
2591,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"Where many bold swimmers are seen to drown,"
2592,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"A man will reach out and, in desperate fashion,"
2593,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,Will drag whoever is nearest him down.
2594,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,
2595,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,Though the strings of his heart may be wrenched and riven
2596,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"By a maiden coquette who has led him along,"
2597,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"She can be pardoned, excused and forgiven,"
2598,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,For innocence blindfolded walks into wrong.
2599,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,But she who has willingly taken the fetter
2600,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,That Cupid forges at Hymen’s command--
2601,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"Well, she is the woman who ought to know better;"
2602,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,She needs no mercy at any man’s hand.
2603,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,
2604,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"In the game of hearts, though a woman be winner,"
2605,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"The odds are ever against her, you know;"

2607,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,And man is ready to make her so.
2608,A MARRIED COQUETTE.,"Shame is likely, and sorrow is certain,"

3409,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3410,DICK’S FAMILY.,"When Dick, the little deformed invalid, hobbled from his bed into his"
3411,DICK’S FAMILY.,"chair-lounge at the window, where he reclined all day long, he saw a"
3412,DICK’S FAMILY.,rosy-cheeked young woman polishing the windows across the street.
3413,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3414,DICK’S FAMILY.,"His pale face tinged with a sudden glow, and his painfully brilliant"
3415,DICK’S FAMILY.,eyes shone with an increased lustre.
3416,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3417,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Well, I _declare_ if my house isn’t occupied!” he cried, and he lifted"
3418,DICK’S FAMILY.,"the window and peered across the way with such an excited countenance,"
3419,DICK’S FAMILY.,that the young woman opposite paused in her work to regard him. But
3420,DICK’S FAMILY.,after a moment’s observation the startled look in her face gave place to
3421,DICK’S FAMILY.,"pity, for she saw that the great shining eyes were those of an"
3422,DICK’S FAMILY.,"invalid--an invalid child, she thought."
3423,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3424,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Poor child; poor little fellow,” she said to herself, “and such a"
3425,DICK’S FAMILY.,"pretty face, too!”"
3426,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3427,DICK’S FAMILY.,"But Dick was twenty-two years old, with a man’s heart and a man’s"
3428,DICK’S FAMILY.,longings shut up in his deformed body. But since he was compelled to
3429,DICK’S FAMILY.,"pass his days between a bed and a chair, with an occasional hour down on"
3430,DICK’S FAMILY.,"the curbing in the sunlight of a warm day, he found his whole enjoyment"
3431,DICK’S FAMILY.,"in his imagination. And wonderful flights it took, flights and freaks"
3432,DICK’S FAMILY.,"suspected by no one save good old Dr. Griffin, his one confidant."
3433,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3434,DICK’S FAMILY.,He had known Dick ever since his advent into his life of misery. Dick’s
3435,DICK’S FAMILY.,mother had been the beauty of the street more than a score of years ago.
3436,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Old Benjamin Levy, her father, was a hard man, and to escape the barren"
3437,DICK’S FAMILY.,"home and dreary life, pretty Josie eloped with a handsome Christian whom"
3438,DICK’S FAMILY.,she had met while promenading on the street. Her father had uttered a
3439,DICK’S FAMILY.,terrible curse when the knowledge of her flight came to him; and scarce
3440,DICK’S FAMILY.,"two years later the curse had fallen, for pretty Josie came home to die,"
3441,DICK’S FAMILY.,and to leave her invalid baby as the constant reminder of the fulfilment
3442,DICK’S FAMILY.,"of his curse, to her father."
3443,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3444,DICK’S FAMILY.,Dr. Griffin had been retained during all these years as Dick’s
3445,DICK’S FAMILY.,physician; for the one thing in which old Benjamin showed no parsimony
3446,DICK’S FAMILY.,was in the care of this little deformed grandchild. A little shop where
3447,DICK’S FAMILY.,"he sold second-hand clothing, and a couple of small rooms above it, for"
3448,DICK’S FAMILY.,living purposes constituted his _ménage_.
3449,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3450,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Directly opposite was a three-story and basement brick house, which had"
3451,DICK’S FAMILY.,in its day been a semi-fashionable private residence. But as trade
3452,DICK’S FAMILY.,"encroached upon the street, this building had degenerated to an"
3453,DICK’S FAMILY.,apartment house.
3454,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3455,DICK’S FAMILY.,"While the house stood tenantless, Dick amused himself by imagining that"
3456,DICK’S FAMILY.,it was his own residence.
3457,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3458,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“It is my house,” he would say, “and I am traveling abroad, and it is"
3459,DICK’S FAMILY.,"closed. By and by I shall come home, and there will be a great"
3460,DICK’S FAMILY.,"house-warmin’, and lights in every window and flower-pots on the sills,"
3461,DICK’S FAMILY.,and pretty curtains and life and fun; for I am a very rich young man
3462,DICK’S FAMILY.,"with lots of money, and I always have everything very gay around me.”"
3463,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3464,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Dr. Griffin used to encourage the boy in his fancies, thinking they"
3465,DICK’S FAMILY.,"relieved the monotony of his dreary life. “Well, I see you are still"
3466,DICK’S FAMILY.,"traveling abroad, Dick,” he used to say. “That house of yours is still"
3467,DICK’S FAMILY.,"closed. No idea when you will return, have you?”"
3468,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3469,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“No, I’m havin’ too good a time to come back yet awhile,” Dick would"
3470,DICK’S FAMILY.,answer. “Haven’t half seen the world yet.”
3471,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3472,DICK’S FAMILY.,But one day there were people moving about on the ground floor of the
3473,DICK’S FAMILY.,"house, and Dick heard his grandfather say it was to be made into flats,"
3474,DICK’S FAMILY.,and let to separate families.
3475,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3476,DICK’S FAMILY.,"The next time Dr. Griffin called, he greeted the boy with--"
3477,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3478,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Hello! Dick, welcome home! I see you have returned from abroad.”"
3479,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3480,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Dick shook his head soberly. “Oh, no!” he replied, “I am not back yet."
3481,DICK’S FAMILY.,But I got tired of havin’ my house stay empty--thought I might as well
3482,DICK’S FAMILY.,"let it help pay my expenses (it’s awful expensive travelin’, you know),"
3483,DICK’S FAMILY.,"so I’ve got some tenants in the house. Goin’ to let each floor separate,"
3484,DICK’S FAMILY.,"’cause it is too expensive a house for anybody to take whole, ’cept some"
3485,DICK’S FAMILY.,rich feller like me.”
3486,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3487,DICK’S FAMILY.,During the last six months the floor exactly opposite Dick’s window had
3488,DICK’S FAMILY.,"been vacant. After three months had passed without a tenant, he told Dr."
3489,DICK’S FAMILY.,Griffin that he had decided to reserve that floor for his own use.
3490,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3491,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“I’m goin’ to come home pretty soon and settle down, you see,” he said,"
3492,DICK’S FAMILY.,“and so I thought I’d keep that floor for myself. I don’t need the whole
3493,DICK’S FAMILY.,"house, and I can just as well let the other tenants stay.”"
3494,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3495,DICK’S FAMILY.,"And now, after three months more had passed, here were people moving"
3496,DICK’S FAMILY.,into his apartments!
3497,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3498,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Dr. Griffin called that very afternoon, and found Dick looking unusually"
3499,DICK’S FAMILY.,animated.
3500,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3501,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Well, well, Dick!” he exclaimed. “So, after all you’ve decided to rent"
3502,DICK’S FAMILY.,"your apartments? You have neighbors, I see. I fear you will never return"
3503,DICK’S FAMILY.,now and settle down as you intended.”
3504,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3505,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Why, that’s no neighbors, Doctor,” replied Dick, contemptuously;"
3506,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“that’s my family. I’ve come home to stay, and brought my family, you"
3507,DICK’S FAMILY.,see.”
3508,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3509,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“You don’t tell me so! Why, what a stupid old fellow I am, to be sure!”"
3510,DICK’S FAMILY.,"cried the Doctor, with feigned self-scorn. “How large a family have you,"
3511,DICK’S FAMILY.,Dick?”
3512,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3513,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Well, only--only one, as I care ’specially about. Look--look at her,"
3514,DICK’S FAMILY.,Doctor!” catching the Doctor’s hand and leaning forward in his chair.
3515,DICK’S FAMILY.,“See her a-fixin’ the nice little curtain at the window? She’s a regular
3516,DICK’S FAMILY.,"neat one, she is, my little woman over there. She was a-cleanin’ the"
3517,DICK’S FAMILY.,windows and things this mornin’ with her hair so slick and a span clean
3518,DICK’S FAMILY.,apron on. That’s the kind of girl I like. I allers liked that kind.
3519,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Isn’t she the right kind, eh, Doctor?”"
3520,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3521,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Dr. Griffin saw a trim young woman with rosy cheeks, looping back scrim"
3522,DICK’S FAMILY.,curtains with pink ribbons. He nodded gravely.
3523,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3524,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“From my brief acquaintance, I should say she was,” he answered. “I"
3525,DICK’S FAMILY.,"congratulate you on your good luck. With such a family as that, you"
3526,DICK’S FAMILY.,ought to be a happy fellow!”
3527,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3528,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Queer little fellow; queer little fellow,” he said to himself, as he"
3529,DICK’S FAMILY.,went down the stairs. “Strange notion that about his home and family.”
3530,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3531,DICK’S FAMILY.,When Dick awoke the following day he felt a new sense of happiness in
3532,DICK’S FAMILY.,the thought of his neighbor opposite. He hurried through his tedious
3533,DICK’S FAMILY.,"ceremony of dressing, ate his frugal breakfast, hobbled into his"
3534,DICK’S FAMILY.,"invalid-chair, and gave an eager glance across the street. Yes, there"
3535,DICK’S FAMILY.,"were the dainty curtains still at the window, so it was no dream. He"
3536,DICK’S FAMILY.,"watched for a glimpse of the occupant, but she did not appear. Then he"
3537,DICK’S FAMILY.,laughed a little softly to himself.
3538,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3539,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Of course, she wouldn’t be hangin’ around the window at all hours; she"
3540,DICK’S FAMILY.,"isn’t that sort; and, of course, I’m over there now, and she’s a-pourin’"
3541,DICK’S FAMILY.,"coffee for me; we take breakfast sort of late to-day, ’cause we’re just"
3542,DICK’S FAMILY.,"home from Europe, and I haven’t gone down to the office yet. After I get"
3543,DICK’S FAMILY.,"off she’ll brush around and set things to right, and--hello! I must have"
3544,DICK’S FAMILY.,gone now you know for there she is a-whiskin’ the dust off the
3545,DICK’S FAMILY.,window-sill as pretty as ever and as neat as a pin. All the time I’m
3546,DICK’S FAMILY.,down at the office with them pesky clerks of mine a-botherin’ me I’ll be
3547,DICK’S FAMILY.,thinkin’ of that sweet little woman up here waitin’ for me.”
3548,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3549,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“We do have very sociable times,” Dick told the Doctor a month later."
3550,DICK’S FAMILY.,“That little woman and I seem made for each other. She’s just the right
3551,DICK’S FAMILY.,"sort. We never have no fusses, and things go so comfortable-like all the"
3552,DICK’S FAMILY.,time.”
3553,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3554,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“And how do you like the other party? There’s a man there also, I see."
3555,DICK’S FAMILY.,How do you like him?”
3556,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3557,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Dick flushed painfully, and a deep frown settled on his face. There was"
3558,DICK’S FAMILY.,a man whom he saw from time to time sitting at the window after the
3559,DICK’S FAMILY.,"dinner hour reading his paper. But the moment he made his appearance,"
3560,DICK’S FAMILY.,Dick closed his eyes or left the window seat. He regarded the man as an
3561,DICK’S FAMILY.,"intruder--a shadow upon his home life, a serpent in his Eden."
3562,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3563,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Sunday was a day of restlessness and discontent, because the man was"
3564,DICK’S FAMILY.,"there all day long, and on Sundays he avoided the invalid-chair, which"
3565,DICK’S FAMILY.,"was his seat on all other days. Now, when he heard Dr. Griffin speak of"
3566,DICK’S FAMILY.,"the man as a real being, he suffered all the bitter and mortifying pangs"
3567,DICK’S FAMILY.,of jealousy which might come to a man who hears a stranger give words to
3568,DICK’S FAMILY.,a suspicion of his wife’s disloyalty to which he has striven to blind
3569,DICK’S FAMILY.,himself.
3570,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3571,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“A man--a--yes--there’s a man there sometimes,” Dick stammered; “he’s"
3572,DICK’S FAMILY.,"a--a sort of poor relative, don’t you know. One of my relations, you"
3573,DICK’S FAMILY.,"see, and I can’t very well turn him off.”"
3574,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3575,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Oh, I see,” answered the Doctor, noticing Dick’s confusion and"
3576,DICK’S FAMILY.,"hastening to help him out. “Well, everybody has some one of that sort."
3577,DICK’S FAMILY.,I’ve half a dozen poor relatives who live on me. Some one of them is
3578,DICK’S FAMILY.,"with us most of the time. A little uncomfortable occasionally may be,"
3579,DICK’S FAMILY.,because every man’s house is his castle where he wants to be alone at
3580,DICK’S FAMILY.,times. But we who have homes have no right to be selfish; we must share
3581,DICK’S FAMILY.,them with less fortunate people. Happiness must not make us selfish.”
3582,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3583,DICK’S FAMILY.,Dick’s face brightened. His heart had grown light and happy while the
3584,DICK’S FAMILY.,Doctor spoke.
3585,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3586,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“That’s just what I tell myself and the little woman,” he said. “Often"
3587,DICK’S FAMILY.,she doesn’t like to have the fellow droppin’ in and spoilin’ our chats”
3588,DICK’S FAMILY.,"(Dick felt an immense satisfaction in saying this), “but I tell her with"
3589,DICK’S FAMILY.,just our two selves we’d get selfish with happiness unless we had
3590,DICK’S FAMILY.,somethin’ to do for another. But he does break up our Sundays
3591,DICK’S FAMILY.,"awfully--scarcely can get a word alone, that fellow’s pokin’ around so.”"
3592,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3593,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Oh, well, you can afford him one day in the week, and I wouldn’t let"
3594,DICK’S FAMILY.,him bother me; just be as happy as if he wasn’t around.”
3595,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3596,DICK’S FAMILY.,Somehow Dick felt much better after this talk. He had tried to ignore
3597,DICK’S FAMILY.,"the presence of the man opposite, but now he could acknowledge it, and"
3598,DICK’S FAMILY.,"definitely locate the man in his thought as a poor dependent, who was"
3599,DICK’S FAMILY.,benefitted by his bounty. He enjoyed thinking that the little woman
3600,DICK’S FAMILY.,"objected more or less to the fellow, and that she allowed him so much"
3601,DICK’S FAMILY.,liberty only to please Dick. As the weeks rolled on he confessed to the
3602,DICK’S FAMILY.,Doctor that the fellow was really useful at times.
3603,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3604,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Rainy days he goes to market for the little woman,” he said, “and often"
3605,DICK’S FAMILY.,runs out on errands for us.”
3606,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3607,DICK’S FAMILY.,“Dick’s house” had been occupied six months when a whole week passed
3608,DICK’S FAMILY.,without his seeing his “little woman” at the window. During that six
3609,DICK’S FAMILY.,months there had scarcely been an afternoon during which she had not sat
3610,DICK’S FAMILY.,for an hour or two at the window with her sewing. Dick had grown to
3611,DICK’S FAMILY.,think of that hour as the bright spoke in the wheel of the day. She
3612,DICK’S FAMILY.,"looked at him so kindly and gently, and he used to imagine he was lying"
3613,DICK’S FAMILY.,"on a lounge in the room, reading aloud to her as she sewed, and that her"
3614,DICK’S FAMILY.,"kind, warm smile was one of love, not of pity. And when a whole week"
3615,DICK’S FAMILY.,"passed without his once seeing her, Dick found himself in a nervous"
3616,DICK’S FAMILY.,"fever, with a blinding headache from having gazed so eagerly and"
3617,DICK’S FAMILY.,"anxiously across the street, and Grandfather Levy sent for Dr. Griffin."
3618,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3619,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“There’s somethin’ the matter over the way,” whispered Dick, as soon as"
3620,DICK’S FAMILY.,the Doctor was alone with him. “I haven’t seen her for a whole week;
3621,DICK’S FAMILY.,"there’s a strange woman there, and I’m sure she’s sick. I couldn’t sleep"
3622,DICK’S FAMILY.,all last night for worryin’ about her.”
3623,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3624,DICK’S FAMILY.,Dr. Griffin went to the window and looked out. Then he took a magnifying
3625,DICK’S FAMILY.,"glass from his pocket, and deliberately stared into the window opposite."
3626,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3627,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Then he went back to Dick. “My dear fellow,” he said, “you are to be"
3628,DICK’S FAMILY.,congratulated. You are a father. I saw the nurse walking up and down the
3629,DICK’S FAMILY.,"room with the child in her arms. It is a bad habit, by the way, and you"
3630,DICK’S FAMILY.,must tell her not to teach it to the child. You can’t begin too young
3631,DICK’S FAMILY.,with them.”
3632,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3633,DICK’S FAMILY.,"After the Doctor went away, Dick buried his face in his pillow and wept"
3634,DICK’S FAMILY.,softly.
3635,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3636,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“A little baby--yes, my little baby,” he whispered. “God bless the"
3637,DICK’S FAMILY.,"little woman. Some day she will sit with it at the window, and I shall"
3638,DICK’S FAMILY.,have them both for company.”
3639,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3640,DICK’S FAMILY.,"And then one day, a soft, warm day, late in May, there she sat at the"
3641,DICK’S FAMILY.,"window again, with lilies instead of roses in her cheeks, and the bundle"
3642,DICK’S FAMILY.,"of flannel in her arms. She smiled at Dick, and tears of joy and love"
3643,DICK’S FAMILY.,welled up in his eyes as he gazed upon the two.
3644,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3645,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“I’ve got two of ’em for company now, the little woman and the baby,” he"
3646,DICK’S FAMILY.,whispered.
3647,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3648,DICK’S FAMILY.,"After that the days seemed very happy and bright, and Dick thought"
3649,DICK’S FAMILY.,himself the richest man on earth. Only he wondered why the roses did not
3650,DICK’S FAMILY.,come back to the little woman’s cheeks.
3651,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3652,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“She doesn’t look as well as she ought to,” he told the Doctor one day"
3653,DICK’S FAMILY.,"in June, and the Doctor, peering over his spectacles, shook his head as"
3654,DICK’S FAMILY.,"he looked at her, but Dick did not see it."
3655,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3656,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Passing down the block one day, Dr. Griffin came face to face with a"
3657,DICK’S FAMILY.,"little girl who wheeled a baby carriage, and, as he glanced under the"
3658,DICK’S FAMILY.,"awning, he was startled to see two weirdly brilliant eyes, the very"
3659,DICK’S FAMILY.,"counterpart of Dick’s, gazing up at him."
3660,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3661,DICK’S FAMILY.,“Whose child is this? Does it live over in the brick flats there?”
3662,DICK’S FAMILY.,queried the Doctor.
3663,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3664,DICK’S FAMILY.,The little girl nodded.
3665,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3666,DICK’S FAMILY.,“Second flight up?”
3667,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3668,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Yes, sir.”"
3669,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3670,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Queer enough, queer enough,” he mused, as he walked on."
3671,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3672,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“Your baby has eyes exactly like you, Dick,” said the Doctor, a few days"
3673,DICK’S FAMILY.,"later. “Honestly, no joking; I saw the little fellow on the street and"
3674,DICK’S FAMILY.,knew him by his eyes.”
3675,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3676,DICK’S FAMILY.,"After that Dick’s heart went out to the baby more and more, and he was"
3677,DICK’S FAMILY.,eager to see it. One day he saw the little nurse-girl wheeling the
3678,DICK’S FAMILY.,"carriage, and as fast as his lame body would permit he hurried and"
3679,DICK’S FAMILY.,"hobbled down to the street, hoping it would pass near him. Sure enough"
3680,DICK’S FAMILY.,"it did, and Dick’s heart jumped into his throat as he leaned on his cane"
3681,DICK’S FAMILY.,and peered into the carriage to catch his first glimpse of the baby he
3682,DICK’S FAMILY.,"had grown to think of as his own. Yes, those were his own eyes--his very"
3683,DICK’S FAMILY.,"own gazing up at him, and he touched the little hand with reverence and"
3684,DICK’S FAMILY.,awe. The baby laughed and twisted its small soft fingers about his
3685,DICK’S FAMILY.,"thumb, and clung to his hand as if unwilling to let him go. For weeks"
3686,DICK’S FAMILY.,"after that he would wake at night, thinking he felt that clinging touch"
3687,DICK’S FAMILY.,"upon his hand; and those great dark, startled eyes, the very counterpart"
3688,DICK’S FAMILY.,"of his own, seemed illuminating the night for him."
3689,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3690,DICK’S FAMILY.,It was early November when he failed to see the baby at the window or on
3691,DICK’S FAMILY.,the street; nor did the mother appear at the window for four days. The
3692,DICK’S FAMILY.,"morning of the fifth day, Dick saw from his window a little white hearse"
3693,DICK’S FAMILY.,"drawn by white ponies pause at the house opposite, and then some one"
3694,DICK’S FAMILY.,came out with a small casket followed by the “male relative” and a few
3695,DICK’S FAMILY.,sad-faced friends.
3696,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3697,DICK’S FAMILY.,"That day Dick entered Gethsemane, and the mourners who followed the"
3698,DICK’S FAMILY.,little baby to its last resting-place shed no bitterer tears than he.
3699,DICK’S FAMILY.,Mixed with his keen anguish for the loss of the child was fear for the
3700,DICK’S FAMILY.,life of the mother who was too ill to attend the burial.
3701,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3702,DICK’S FAMILY.,"That night Dr. Griffin was sent for, and he found Dick so ill and"
3703,DICK’S FAMILY.,"feverish that he was alarmed. His tears mingled with Dick’s, when the"
3704,DICK’S FAMILY.,"poor boy told him of the baby’s death, and begged him to go over and"
3705,DICK’S FAMILY.,inquire after the “little woman.”
3706,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3707,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“You can ask the janitor, Doctor; just say friends opposite want to"
3708,DICK’S FAMILY.,inquire after her; you needn’t say no more.”
3709,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3710,DICK’S FAMILY.,"The Doctor did as Dick desired, and came back shortly, making an effort"
3711,DICK’S FAMILY.,to speak cheerfully.
3712,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3713,DICK’S FAMILY.,“The janitor says Mrs.--”
3714,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3715,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“The little woman,” interrupted Dick. “Yes, yes; how is she?” Not for"
3716,DICK’S FAMILY.,worlds would he have heard her name spoken.
3717,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3718,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“She is ill, suffering from a prostration caused by grief,” the Doctor"
3719,DICK’S FAMILY.,"replied. “But she is young, and she will rally in a few weeks no doubt."
3720,DICK’S FAMILY.,"You must brace up, old man, and be ready to comfort her. If you don’t"
3721,DICK’S FAMILY.,look after yourself a little better I won’t promise for the consequences
3722,DICK’S FAMILY.,"to your health. You’ve overtaxed yourself lately, and you must keep very"
3723,DICK’S FAMILY.,quiet now for a few days.”
3724,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3725,DICK’S FAMILY.,But each day Dick dragged himself to the window to see if the little
3726,DICK’S FAMILY.,"woman was visible. And on the tenth day after the baby’s funeral, a"
3727,DICK’S FAMILY.,"black hearse with nodding black plumes, and black horses with jet"
3728,DICK’S FAMILY.,"harness and dangling black tassels, stood at the house opposite; and"
3729,DICK’S FAMILY.,"Dick, with panting breath and wild eyes, crawled down the stairs, and"
3730,DICK’S FAMILY.,"out upon the street, for he seemed choking in the house, and he thought"
3731,DICK’S FAMILY.,he must hinder those cruel people from taking away the little woman. He
3732,DICK’S FAMILY.,"could not, could not let her go from him forever, and when he saw them"
3733,DICK’S FAMILY.,"lifting the casket into the hearse, he reached out his arms, tried to"
3734,DICK’S FAMILY.,"cry out and stop them, and then he fell over weak and helpless, with"
3735,DICK’S FAMILY.,strange sounds ringing in his ears and warm blood spurting from his
3736,DICK’S FAMILY.,"mouth. When he awoke to consciousness he was lying on his couch, and Dr."
3737,DICK’S FAMILY.,Griffin and Grandfather Levy were bending over him with tears in their
3738,DICK’S FAMILY.,eyes.
3739,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3740,DICK’S FAMILY.,"He tried to speak, and with each syllable the blood gushed again from"
3741,DICK’S FAMILY.,his lips.
3742,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3743,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“You mustn’t talk,” said the Doctor. “You are very weak and it may be"
3744,DICK’S FAMILY.,fatal to you if you do not keep quiet.”
3745,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3746,DICK’S FAMILY.,He drew the Doctor’s head down close to his lips.
3747,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3748,DICK’S FAMILY.,"“It’s no use tryin’ to save me,” he whispered. “I’d rather go--I"
3749,DICK’S FAMILY.,couldn’t stand it livin’ on with both of ’em gone. I’ve nothin’ to live
3750,DICK’S FAMILY.,for now--no ambition or pleasure left. I’ve had all the pleasure I’ll
3751,DICK’S FAMILY.,"ever get out of life, Doctor, this year back. It’s kinder to let me"
3752,DICK’S FAMILY.,go--and--follow my family.”
3753,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3754,DICK’S FAMILY.,*       *       *       *       *
3755,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3756,DICK’S FAMILY.,"The hemorrhage set in anew, and with the red gushing tide, Dick’s soul"
3757,DICK’S FAMILY.,passed out to seek those of the little woman and the baby.
3758,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3759,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3760,DICK’S FAMILY.,
3761,DICK’S FAMILY.,
