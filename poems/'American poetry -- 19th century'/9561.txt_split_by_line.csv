37,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Winnepurkit, otherwise called George, Sachem of Saugus, married a"
38,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"daughter of Passaconaway, the great Pennacook chieftain, in 1662. The"
39,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"wedding took place at Pennacook (now Concord, N. H.), and the ceremonies"
40,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"closed with a great feast. According to the usages of the chiefs,"
41,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Passaconaway ordered a select number of his men to accompany the
42,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"newly-married couple to the dwelling of the husband, where in turn there"
43,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"was another great feast. Some time after, the wife of Winnepurkit"
44,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"expressing a desire to visit her father's house was permitted to go,"
45,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,accompanied by a brave escort of her husband's chief men. But when she
46,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"wished to return, her father sent a messenger to Saugus, informing her"
47,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"husband, and asking him to come and take her away. He returned for"
48,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,answer that he had escorted his wife to her father's house in a style
49,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"that became a chief, and that now if she wished to return, her father"
50,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"must send her back, in the same way. This Passaconaway refused to do,"
51,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,and it is said that here terminated the connection of his daughter with
52,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,the Saugus chief.--Vide MORTON'S New Canaan.
53,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,
54,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,
55,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,WE had been wandering for many days
56,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Through the rough northern country. We had seen
57,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The sunset, with its bars of purple cloud,"
58,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Like a new heaven, shine upward from the lake"
59,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Of Winnepiseogee; and had felt
60,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The sunrise breezes, midst the leafy isles"
61,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Which stoop their summer beauty to the lips
62,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of the bright waters. We had checked our steeds,"
63,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Silent with wonder, where the mountain wall"
64,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Is piled to heaven; and, through the narrow rift"
65,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of the vast rocks, against whose rugged feet"
66,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Beats the mad torrent with perpetual roar,"
67,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Where noonday is as twilight, and the wind"
68,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Comes burdened with the everlasting moan
69,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of forests and of far-off waterfalls,"
70,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"We had looked upward where the summer sky,"
71,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Tasselled with clouds light-woven by the sun,"
72,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Sprung its blue arch above the abutting crags
73,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,O'er-roofing the vast portal of the land
74,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Beyond the wall of mountains. We had passed
75,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,The high source of the Saco; and bewildered
76,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"In the dwarf spruce-belts of the Crystal Hills,"
77,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Had heard above us, like a voice in the cloud,"
78,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,The horn of Fabyan sounding; and atop
79,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Of old Agioochook had seen the mountains'
80,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Piled to the northward, shagged with wood, and thick"
81,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"As meadow mole-hills,--the far sea of Casco,"
82,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,A white gleam on the horizon of the east;
83,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Fair lakes, embosomed in the woods and hills;"
84,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Moosehillock's mountain range, and Kearsarge"
85,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Lifting his granite forehead to the sun!
86,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,
87,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,And we had rested underneath the oaks
88,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Shadowing the bank, whose grassy spires are shaken"
89,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,By the perpetual beating of the falls
90,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Of the wild Ammonoosuc. We had tracked
91,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The winding Pemigewasset, overhung"
92,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"By beechen shadows, whitening down its rocks,"
93,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Or lazily gliding through its intervals,"
94,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,From waving rye-fields sending up the gleam
95,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Of sunlit waters. We had seen the moon
96,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Rising behind Umbagog's eastern pines,"
97,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Like a great Indian camp-fire; and its beams
98,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,At midnight spanning with a bridge of silver
99,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,The Merrimac by Uncanoonuc's falls.
100,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,
101,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,There were five souls of us whom travel's chance
102,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Had thrown together in these wild north hills
103,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"A city lawyer, for a month escaping"
104,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"From his dull office, where the weary eye"
105,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Saw only hot brick walls and close thronged streets;
106,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Briefless as yet, but with an eye to see"
107,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Life's sunniest side, and with a heart to take"
108,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Its chances all as godsends; and his brother,"
109,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Pale from long pulpit studies, yet retaining"
110,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The warmth and freshness of a genial heart,"
111,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Whose mirror of the beautiful and true,"
112,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"In Man and Nature, was as yet undimmed"
113,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"By dust of theologic strife, or breath"
114,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of sect, or cobwebs of scholastic lore;"
115,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Like a clear crystal calm of water, taking"
116,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The hue and image of o'erleaning flowers,"
117,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Sweet human faces, white clouds of the noon,"
118,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Slant starlight glimpses through the dewy leaves,"
119,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"And tenderest moonrise. 'T was, in truth, a study,"
120,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"To mark his spirit, alternating between"
121,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,A decent and professional gravity
122,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"And an irreverent mirthfulness, which often"
123,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Laughed in the face of his divinity,"
124,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Plucked off the sacred ephod, quite unshrined"
125,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The oracle, and for the pattern priest"
126,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Left us the man. A shrewd, sagacious merchant,"
127,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"To whom the soiled sheet found in Crawford's inn,"
128,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Giving the latest news of city stocks
129,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"And sales of cotton, had a deeper meaning"
130,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Than the great presence of the awful mountains
131,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Glorified by the sunset; and his daughter,"
132,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,A delicate flower on whom had blown too long
133,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Those evil winds, which, sweeping from the ice"
134,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"And winnowing the fogs of Labrador,"
135,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Shed their cold blight round Massachusetts Bay,"
136,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,With the same breath which stirs Spring's opening leaves
137,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"And lifts her half-formed flower-bell on its stem,"
138,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Poisoning our seaside atmosphere.
139,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,
140,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"It chanced that as we turned upon our homeward way,"
141,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,A drear northeastern storm came howling up
142,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,The valley of the Saco; and that girl
143,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Who had stood with us upon Mount Washington,"
144,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Her brown locks ruffled by the wind which whirled
145,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"In gusts around its sharp, cold pinnacle,"
146,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Who had joined our gay trout-fishing in the streams
147,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Which lave that giant's feet; whose laugh was heard
148,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Like a bird's carol on the sunrise breeze
149,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Which swelled our sail amidst the lake's green islands,"
150,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Shrank from its harsh, chill breath, and visibly drooped"
151,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Like a flower in the frost. So, in that quiet inn"
152,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Which looks from Conway on the mountains piled
153,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Heavily against the horizon of the north,"
154,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Like summer thunder-clouds, we made our home"
155,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"And while the mist hung over dripping hills,"
156,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,And the cold wind-driven rain-drops all day long
157,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Beat their sad music upon roof and pane,"
158,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,We strove to cheer our gentle invalid.
159,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,
160,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,The lawyer in the pauses of the storm
161,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Went angling down the Saco, and, returning,"
162,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Recounted his adventures and mishaps;
163,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Gave us the history of his scaly clients,"
164,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Mingling with ludicrous yet apt citations
165,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of barbarous law Latin, passages"
166,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"From Izaak Walton's Angler, sweet and fresh"
167,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"As the flower-skirted streams of Staffordshire,"
168,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Where, under aged trees, the southwest wind"
169,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of soft June mornings fanned the thin, white hair"
170,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of the sage fisher. And, if truth be told,"
171,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Our youthful candidate forsook his sermons,"
172,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"His commentaries, articles and creeds,"
173,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"For the fair page of human loveliness,"
174,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The missal of young hearts, whose sacred text"
175,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Is music, its illumining, sweet smiles."
176,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"He sang the songs she loved; and in his low,"
177,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Deep, earnest voice, recited many a page"
178,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of poetry, the holiest, tenderest lines"
179,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of the sad bard of Olney, the sweet songs,"
180,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Simple and beautiful as Truth and Nature,"
181,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Of him whose whitened locks on Rydal Mount
182,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Are lifted yet by morning breezes blowing
183,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"From the green hills, immortal in his lays."
184,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"And for myself, obedient to her wish,"
185,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"I searched our landlord's proffered library,--"
186,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"A well-thumbed Bunyan, with its nice wood pictures"
187,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Of scaly fiends and angels not unlike them;
188,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Watts' unmelodious psalms; Astrology's
189,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Last home, a musty pile of almanacs,"
190,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,And an old chronicle of border wars
191,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"And Indian history. And, as I read"
192,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,A story of the marriage of the Chief
193,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of Saugus to the dusky Weetamoo,"
194,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Daughter of Passaconaway, who dwelt"
195,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"In the old time upon the Merrimac,"
196,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Our fair one, in the playful exercise"
197,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of her prerogative,--the right divine"
198,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of youth and beauty,--bade us versify"
199,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The legend, and with ready pencil sketched"
200,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Its plan and outlines, laughingly assigning"
201,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"To each his part, and barring our excuses"
202,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"With absolute will. So, like the cavaliers"
203,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Whose voices still are heard in the Romance
204,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of silver-tongued Boccaccio, on the banks"
205,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of Arno, with soft tales of love beguiling"
206,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The ear of languid beauty, plague-exiled"
207,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"From stately Florence, we rehearsed our rhymes"
208,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"To their fair auditor, and shared by turns"
209,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Her kind approval and her playful censure.
210,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,
211,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,It may be that these fragments owe alone
212,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"To the fair setting of their circumstances,--"
213,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The associations of time, scene, and audience,--"
214,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Their place amid the pictures which fill up
215,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,The chambers of my memory. Yet I trust
216,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"That some, who sigh, while wandering in thought,"
217,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Pilgrims of Romance o'er the olden world,"
218,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"That our broad land,--our sea-like lakes and mountains"
219,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Piled to the clouds, our rivers overhung"
220,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,By forests which have known no other change
221,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,For ages than the budding and the fall
222,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of leaves, our valleys lovelier than those"
223,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Which the old poets sang of,--should but figure"
224,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,On the apocryphal chart of speculation
225,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"As pastures, wood-lots, mill-sites, with the privileges,"
226,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Rights, and appurtenances, which make up"
227,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"A Yankee Paradise, unsung, unknown,"
228,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"To beautiful tradition; even their names,"
229,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Whose melody yet lingers like the last
230,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Vibration of the red man's requiem,"
231,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Exchanged for syllables significant,"
232,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of cotton-mill and rail-car, will look kindly"
233,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Upon this effort to call up the ghost
234,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of our dim Past, and listen with pleased ear"
235,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,To the responses of the questioned Shade.
236,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,
237,I. THE MERRIMAC.,I. THE MERRIMAC.
238,I. THE MERRIMAC.,O child of that white-crested mountain whose
239,I. THE MERRIMAC.,springs
240,I. THE MERRIMAC.,Gush forth in the shade of the cliff-eagle's
241,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"wings,"
242,I. THE MERRIMAC.,Down whose slopes to the lowlands thy wild waters
243,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"shine,"
244,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"Leaping gray walls of rock, flashing through the"
245,I. THE MERRIMAC.,dwarf pine;
246,I. THE MERRIMAC.,From that cloud-curtained cradle so cold and so
247,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"lone,"
248,I. THE MERRIMAC.,From the arms of that wintry-locked mother of
249,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"stone,"
250,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"By hills hung with forests, through vales wide and"
251,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"free,"
252,I. THE MERRIMAC.,Thy mountain-born brightness glanced down to the
253,I. THE MERRIMAC.,sea.
254,I. THE MERRIMAC.,
255,I. THE MERRIMAC.,No bridge arched thy waters save that where the
256,I. THE MERRIMAC.,trees
257,I. THE MERRIMAC.,Stretched their long arms above thee and kissed in
258,I. THE MERRIMAC.,the breeze:
259,I. THE MERRIMAC.,No sound save the lapse of the waves on thy
260,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"shores,"
261,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"The plunging of otters, the light dip of oars."
262,I. THE MERRIMAC.,
263,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"Green-tufted, oak-shaded, by Amoskeag's fall"
264,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"Thy twin Uncanoonucs rose stately and tall,"
265,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"Thy Nashua meadows lay green and unshorn,"
266,I. THE MERRIMAC.,And the hills of Pentucket were tasselled with
267,I. THE MERRIMAC.,corn.
268,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"But thy Pennacook valley was fairer than these,"
269,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"And greener its grasses and taller its trees,"
270,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"Ere the sound of an axe in the forest had rung,"
271,I. THE MERRIMAC.,Or the mower his scythe in the meadows had
272,I. THE MERRIMAC.,swung.
273,I. THE MERRIMAC.,
274,I. THE MERRIMAC.,In their sheltered repose looking out from the
275,I. THE MERRIMAC.,wood
276,I. THE MERRIMAC.,The bark-builded wigwams of Pennacook stood;
277,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"There glided the corn-dance, the council-fire shone,"
278,I. THE MERRIMAC.,And against the red war-post the hatchet was
279,I. THE MERRIMAC.,thrown.
280,I. THE MERRIMAC.,
281,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"There the old smoked in silence their pipes, and"
282,I. THE MERRIMAC.,the young
283,I. THE MERRIMAC.,To the pike and the white-perch their baited lines
284,I. THE MERRIMAC.,flung;
285,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"There the boy shaped his arrows, and there the"
286,I. THE MERRIMAC.,shy maid
287,I. THE MERRIMAC.,Wove her many-hued baskets and bright wampum
288,I. THE MERRIMAC.,braid.
289,I. THE MERRIMAC.,
290,I. THE MERRIMAC.,O Stream of the Mountains! if answer of thine
291,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"Could rise from thy waters to question of mine,"
292,I. THE MERRIMAC.,Methinks through the din of thy thronged banks
293,I. THE MERRIMAC.,a moan
294,I. THE MERRIMAC.,Of sorrow would swell for the days which have
295,I. THE MERRIMAC.,gone.
296,I. THE MERRIMAC.,
297,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"Not for thee the dull jar of the loom and the wheel,"
298,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"The gliding of shuttles, the ringing of steel;"
299,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"But that old voice of waters, of bird and of breeze,"
300,I. THE MERRIMAC.,"The dip of the wild-fowl, the rustling of trees."

304,II. THE BASHABA.,"Lift we the twilight curtains of the Past,"

306,II. THE BASHABA.,Sadly and full of reverence let us cast
307,II. THE BASHABA.,"A glance upon Tradition's shadowy ground,"
308,II. THE BASHABA.,"Led by the few pale lights which, glimmering round"
309,II. THE BASHABA.,"That dim, strange land of Eld, seem dying fast;"
310,II. THE BASHABA.,"And that which history gives not to the eye,"
311,II. THE BASHABA.,"The faded coloring of Time's tapestry,"
312,II. THE BASHABA.,"Let Fancy, with her dream-dipped brush, supply."
313,II. THE BASHABA.,
314,II. THE BASHABA.,"Roof of bark and walls of pine,"
315,II. THE BASHABA.,"Through whose chinks the sunbeams shine,"
316,II. THE BASHABA.,Tracing many a golden line
317,II. THE BASHABA.,On the ample floor within;
318,II. THE BASHABA.,"Where, upon that earth-floor stark,"
319,II. THE BASHABA.,"Lay the gaudy mats of bark,"
320,II. THE BASHABA.,"With the bear's hide, rough and dark,"
321,II. THE BASHABA.,And the red-deer's skin.
322,II. THE BASHABA.,
323,II. THE BASHABA.,"Window-tracery, small and slight,"
324,II. THE BASHABA.,"Woven of the willow white,"
325,II. THE BASHABA.,Lent a dimly checkered light;
326,II. THE BASHABA.,"And the night-stars glimmered down,"
327,II. THE BASHABA.,"Where the lodge-fire's heavy smoke,"
328,II. THE BASHABA.,"Slowly through an opening broke,"
329,II. THE BASHABA.,"In the low roof, ribbed with oak,"
330,II. THE BASHABA.,Sheathed with hemlock brown.
331,II. THE BASHABA.,
332,II. THE BASHABA.,Gloomed behind the changeless shade
333,II. THE BASHABA.,By the solemn pine-wood made;
334,II. THE BASHABA.,"Through the rugged palisade,"
335,II. THE BASHABA.,"In the open foreground planted,"
336,II. THE BASHABA.,"Glimpses came of rowers rowing,"
337,II. THE BASHABA.,"Stir of leaves and wild-flowers blowing,"
338,II. THE BASHABA.,"Steel-like gleams of water flowing,"
339,II. THE BASHABA.,In the sunlight slanted.
340,II. THE BASHABA.,
341,II. THE BASHABA.,Here the mighty Bashaba
342,II. THE BASHABA.,"Held his long-unquestioned sway,"
343,II. THE BASHABA.,"From the White Hills, far away,"
344,II. THE BASHABA.,To the great sea's sounding shore;
345,II. THE BASHABA.,"Chief of chiefs, his regal word"
346,II. THE BASHABA.,"All the river Sachems heard,"
347,II. THE BASHABA.,"At his call the war-dance stirred,"
348,II. THE BASHABA.,Or was still once more.
349,II. THE BASHABA.,
350,II. THE BASHABA.,"There his spoils of chase and war,"
351,II. THE BASHABA.,"Jaw of wolf and black bear's paw,"
352,II. THE BASHABA.,"Panther's skin and eagle's claw,"
353,II. THE BASHABA.,Lay beside his axe and bow;
354,II. THE BASHABA.,"And, adown the roof-pole hung,"
355,II. THE BASHABA.,"Loosely on a snake-skin strung,"
356,II. THE BASHABA.,In the smoke his scalp-locks swung
357,II. THE BASHABA.,Grimly to and fro.
358,II. THE BASHABA.,
359,II. THE BASHABA.,"Nightly down the river going,"
360,II. THE BASHABA.,"Swifter was the hunter's rowing,"
361,II. THE BASHABA.,"When he saw that lodge-fire, glowing"
362,II. THE BASHABA.,O'er the waters still and red;
363,II. THE BASHABA.,"And the squaw's dark eye burned brighter,"
364,II. THE BASHABA.,"And she drew her blanket tighter,"

870,VII. THE DEPARTURE.,
871,VII. THE DEPARTURE.,"On that strong turbid water, a small boat"
872,VII. THE DEPARTURE.,Guided by one weak hand was seen to float;
873,VII. THE DEPARTURE.,"Evil the fate which loosed it from the shore,"
874,VII. THE DEPARTURE.,Too early voyager with too frail an oar!
875,VII. THE DEPARTURE.,
876,VII. THE DEPARTURE.,"Down the vexed centre of that rushing tide,"
877,VII. THE DEPARTURE.,"The thick huge ice-blocks threatening either side,"
