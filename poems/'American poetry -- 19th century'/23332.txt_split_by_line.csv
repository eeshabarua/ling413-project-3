153,EVANGELINE.,"All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied longing."
154,EVANGELINE.,"All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of patience!"

228,THE SINGERS.,Disputed which the best might be;
229,THE SINGERS.,For still their music seemed to start
230,THE SINGERS.,Discordant echoes in each heart.
231,THE SINGERS.,
232,THE SINGERS.,"But the great Master said, ""I see"
