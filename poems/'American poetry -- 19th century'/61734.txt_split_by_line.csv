184,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
185,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"It is probable that with the presentation of these, among the earliest"
186,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"of the writings of William Sidney Porter (O. Henry), there is nothing"
187,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"left to be added to the total of his work, and that they will close,"
188,TABLE OF CONTENTS,as they in a large measure opened the career of America's greatest
189,TABLE OF CONTENTS,short story writer.
190,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
191,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Aside from the intrinsic merit in the newspaper writings of O. Henry
192,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"which are here given, they have the additional fascination of"
193,TABLE OF CONTENTS,disclosing to all who have read and know O. Henry from his maturer
194,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"work the budding of his genius, the first outcroppings of that style,"
195,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"that vivid drawing of character, that keen sense of humor, and that"
196,TABLE OF CONTENTS,wondrous understanding of human nature which afterward marked him as
197,TABLE OF CONTENTS,one of the world's geniuses. It is as though one might go back and
198,TABLE OF CONTENTS,watch with eyes that have seen its fullest development and matured
199,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"beauty, the forming and unfolding of a rose; as though one who has"
200,TABLE OF CONTENTS,listened to the plaudits of centuries might go back four hundred years
201,TABLE OF CONTENTS,and see and study Raphael as he began to wield the brush which
202,TABLE OF CONTENTS,subsequently wrought such wonderful magic.
203,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
204,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Having a high appreciation of the genius of O. Henry, the compiler"
205,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"took occasion while spending a year in Austin, Texas, where O. Henry"
206,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"had lived, to ask his friends and neighbors about him. Among them was"
207,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Mr. Ed McLean, secretary to the railroad commission, a personal friend"
208,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"of O. Henry's, who told her about the column O. Henry had conducted on"
209,TABLE OF CONTENTS,the Houston _Post_. He thought O. Henry must have worked for the
210,TABLE OF CONTENTS,_Post_ some time in the latter part of 1896 to the fall of 1897.
211,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
212,TABLE OF CONTENTS,A visit to the Houston _Post_ office and a search through the
213,TABLE OF CONTENTS,files of that period were without results. But a call on Mr. A. E.
214,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Clarkson, who was with the _Post_ then and who is now business"
215,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"manager of the _Post_, was more successful. Mr. Clarkson looked"
216,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"up the old records in the business office, showing when O. Henry"
217,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"received pay checks, which served as a guide to pages of a year"
218,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"earlier, where the altogether distinctive touch of O. Henry proved"
219,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"that the goal was reached. Here was found the same discernment, the"
220,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"same insight, the same humor, the same style which runs through all"
221,TABLE OF CONTENTS,his work like a marked thread interwoven into a rare fabric. In many
222,TABLE OF CONTENTS,of the brief paragraphs and short stories were found the idioplasm
223,TABLE OF CONTENTS,which in the rich soil of his fuller experience grew into some of the
224,TABLE OF CONTENTS,masterpieces of his later life.
225,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
226,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Thus in the files of the Houston _Post_ of the period between
227,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"October 18, 1895, and June 22, 1896, were found the writings which"
228,TABLE OF CONTENTS,make up this volume. It was characteristic of O. Henry's modesty that
229,TABLE OF CONTENTS,these were unsigned. They are published as they originally appeared in
230,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"""Tales of the Town,"" ""Postscripts and Pencillings,"" and ""Some"
231,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Postscripts,"" under which titles O. Henry wrote at different times"
232,TABLE OF CONTENTS,during his association with the _Post_.
233,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
234,TABLE OF CONTENTS,But the rediscovery of this work was not enough. To identify it as
235,TABLE OF CONTENTS,beyond question of doubt as that of O. Henry was imperative. To have
236,TABLE OF CONTENTS,offered these writings with less of precaution would have savored of
237,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"literary vandalism, if not sacrilege. This identification has been"
238,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"made, and its sources are herewith given the reader as a part of the"
239,TABLE OF CONTENTS,introduction of this volume.
240,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
241,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Here is an account by Mr. R. M. Johnston, who formerly controlled the"
242,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Houston _Post_, of how he gave O. Henry the job in which he was"
243,TABLE OF CONTENTS,first to demonstrate his remarkable story-telling gifts:
244,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
245,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Houston, Texas, October 21, 1922."
246,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Miss Florence Stratton,"
247,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
248,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Beaumont, Texas."
249,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
250,TABLE OF CONTENTS,My dear Miss Stratton:
251,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
252,TABLE OF CONTENTS,You asked me to write some incidents of O. Henry's
253,TABLE OF CONTENTS,connection with the Houston _Post_ when I controlled
254,TABLE OF CONTENTS,that newspaper and I am glad to comply with your request.
255,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
256,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"The first thing I ever heard of Mr. Porter, whose"
257,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"writing name was O. Henry, was when some one sent me a copy"
258,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"of the little publication, ""The Rolling Stone,"" published in"
259,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Austin. This was sent me by Mr. Ed McLean, Secretary of the"
260,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Railroad Commission, a mutual friend of Mr. Porter and"
261,TABLE OF CONTENTS,myself. Mr. McLean made the suggestion that Porter would be
262,TABLE OF CONTENTS,worth considering for a place as a writer on the
263,TABLE OF CONTENTS,_Post_. After reading _The Rolling Stone_ I made
264,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"an appointment through Mr. McLean with Mr. Porter, who was"
265,TABLE OF CONTENTS,at that time an employe of one of the banks at Austin.
266,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Subsequently I met him and made a contract with him to join
267,TABLE OF CONTENTS,the _Post_ editorial staff which he did in a short
268,TABLE OF CONTENTS,time. While on the paper his duties were somewhat of a
269,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"varied nature. He had, however, a column on the editorial"
270,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"page daily filled with witticism, quaint little stories,"
271,TABLE OF CONTENTS,etc. He also did some special assignment work in a very
272,TABLE OF CONTENTS,magnificent way.
273,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
274,TABLE OF CONTENTS,One morning while sitting at my desk he came to my
275,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"office in his usual quiet, dignified way and laid a piece of"
276,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"cardboard on my table with the remark, ""I don't suppose you"
277,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"will want this, but I thought I would let you look at it,"""
278,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"and he walked out. After he had gone, I picked up the"
279,TABLE OF CONTENTS,cardboard and found it was an unusual cartoon. I was so
280,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"struck with it that I took it to his room and remarked,"
281,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"""Porter, did you do this?"" He looked up with a faint smile,"
282,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"and said ""Yes."" I said to him that I did not know that he"
283,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"was a cartoonist, and his reply was that he did that kind of"
284,TABLE OF CONTENTS,work for his own amusement at odd times.
285,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
286,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"To make a long story short, we were in the midst of a"
287,TABLE OF CONTENTS,very warm political campaign in Texas and during the
288,TABLE OF CONTENTS,campaign he drew some of the most magnificent cartoons that
289,TABLE OF CONTENTS,I have ever seen in print anywhere. They attracted
290,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"attention, not only in Texas, but were copied freely"
291,TABLE OF CONTENTS,throughout the United States.
292,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
293,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Mr. Porter was a lovely character and one of the
294,TABLE OF CONTENTS,brightest men that I have ever come in contact with. He was
295,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"modest, almost to the fault of self-effacement. His leaving"
296,TABLE OF CONTENTS,the Houston _Post_ was an irretrievable loss to the
297,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"paper, but the means possibly of developing the greatest"
298,TABLE OF CONTENTS,short story writer of this or any other age.
299,TABLE OF CONTENTS,

314,W. P. HOBBY,
315,W. P. HOBBY,My dear Miss Stratton:
316,W. P. HOBBY,
317,W. P. HOBBY,In the first years of my employment by the Houston
318,W. P. HOBBY,"_Post_, O. Henry, whose name was Sidney Porter, was a"
319,W. P. HOBBY,"member of the _Post_ staff. As is well known, Mr."
320,W. P. HOBBY,Porter began his daily journalistic work as a special
321,W. P. HOBBY,feature writer for the Houston _Post_ and the human
322,W. P. HOBBY,interest and literary attractiveness of his writings were
323,W. P. HOBBY,a source of delight to Texas readers.
324,W. P. HOBBY,
325,W. P. HOBBY,I enjoyed my acquaintance and association with Mr.
326,W. P. HOBBY,Porter while a youth in the business office of the Houston
327,W. P. HOBBY,"_Post_ and not only the stories that he would write,"
328,W. P. HOBBY,"but those he would tell me, made a deep impression on my"
329,W. P. HOBBY,mind.
330,W. P. HOBBY,
331,W. P. HOBBY,Mr. Porter's work was that of publishing a special
332,W. P. HOBBY,"feature column, ""Some Postscripts and Pencillings"" on the"
333,W. P. HOBBY,"editorial page of the _Post_ during 1895-96, and I"
334,W. P. HOBBY,"think a reproduction of his daily writings in that column,"
335,W. P. HOBBY,which then were followed by the readers of the Texas
336,W. P. HOBBY,newspaper readers of the nation.
337,W. P. HOBBY,
338,W. P. HOBBY,"Yours very truly,"

353,W. P. HOBBY,"In reply to your letter of October 15, I find that Mr."
354,W. P. HOBBY,"Porter, afterward known as O. Henry, was on the payroll of"
355,W. P. HOBBY,the Houston _Post_ from October 1895 to June 1896.
356,W. P. HOBBY,
357,W. P. HOBBY,"During that time Mr. Porter wrote, and there was"
358,W. P. HOBBY,published from time to time in the columns of the
359,W. P. HOBBY,"_Post_ various articles headed ""Some Postscripts"" and"
360,W. P. HOBBY,"""Postscripts and Pencillings."""
361,W. P. HOBBY,
362,W. P. HOBBY,The writer was also connected with the _Post_
363,W. P. HOBBY,"during this period, being in the business office. He was"
364,W. P. HOBBY,personally acquainted with Mr. Porter and knows of his own
365,W. P. HOBBY,knowledge that the articles headed as stated above were
366,W. P. HOBBY,written by him.

1056,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"happy, love, for we have passed through stormy seas of doubt"
1057,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"and anger. But now, a light is breaking, and the rosy dawn"

1070,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1071,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,He
1072,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,Sometimes you have become angry and said hard things
1073,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,without any reason.
1074,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1075,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,She
1076,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"Maybe you think so, but I don't. [Lifts her head from"

1087,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1088,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,He
1089,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,You make me tired. You get on your ear because you are

1091,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,can't help it.
1092,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1093,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,She
1094,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"You old crosspatch of a liar from Liarsville, don't you"

1112,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,Buying a Piano
1113,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1114,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,A Houston man decided a few days ago to buy his wife a piano for a
1115,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"Christmas present. Now, there is more competition, rivalry, and push"
1116,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,among piano agents than any other class of men. The insurance and
1117,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,fruit tree businesses are mild and retiring in comparison with the
1118,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"piano industry. The Houston man, who is a prominent lawyer, knew this,"
1119,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"and he was careful not to tell too many people of his intentions, for"
1120,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,fear the agents would annoy him. He inquired in a music store only
1121,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"once, regarding prices, etc., and intended after a week or so to make"
1122,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,his selection.
1123,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1124,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,When he left the store he went around by the post-office before going
1125,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,back to work.
1126,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1127,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,When he reached his office he found three agents perched on his desk
1128,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,and in his chair waiting for him.
1129,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1130,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"One of them got his mouth open first, and said: ""Hear you want to buy"

1141,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1142,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"""Get out, every one of you,"" shouted the lawyer. ""When I want a piano"
1143,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"I'll buy the one I please. Get out of the room!"""
1144,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1145,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"The agents left, and the lawyer went to work on a brief. During the"
1146,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"afternoon, five of his personal friends called to recommend different"
1147,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"makes of pianos, and the lawyer began to get snappish."
1148,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1149,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"He went out and got a drink and the bartender said: ""Say, gent, me"
1150,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,brudder works in a piano factory and he gimme de tip dat you'se wants

1153,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1154,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"""Devil take your brother,"" said the lawyer."
1155,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1156,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,He got on the street car to go home and four agents were already
1157,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,aboard waiting for him. He dodged back before they saw him and stood
1158,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,on the platform. Presently the brakeman leaned over and whispered in
1159,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,his ear:
1160,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1161,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"""Frien', the Epperson piano what me uncle handles in East Texas, fur"
1162,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"sweetness, durability--"""
1163,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1164,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"""Stop the car,"" said the lawyer. He got off and skulked in a dark"
1165,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"doorway until the four agents, who had also got off the car, rushed"
1166,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"past, and then he picked up a big stone from the gutter and put it in"
1167,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,his pocket. He went around a back way to his home and slipped up to
1168,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,the gate feeling pretty safe.
1169,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1170,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"The minister of his church had been calling at the house, and came out"
1171,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,the gate just as the lawyer reached it. The lawyer was the proud
1172,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"father of a brand-new, two-weeks-old baby, and the minister had just"
1173,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"been admiring it, and wanted to congratulate him."
1174,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1175,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"""My dear brother,"" said the minister. ""Your house will soon be filled"
1176,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,with joy and music. I think it will be a great addition to your life.
1177,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"Now, there is nothing in the world that for sweetness--"""
1178,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1179,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"""Confound you, you're drumming for a piano, too, are you?"" yelled the"
1180,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"lawyer, drawing the stone from his pocket. He fired away and knocked"
1181,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"the minister's tall hat across the street, and kicked him in the shin."
1182,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"The minister believed in the church militant, and he gave the lawyer a"
1183,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"one-two on the nose, and they clinched and rolled off the sidewalk on"
1184,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,a pile of loose bricks. The neighbors heard the row and came out with
1185,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"shotguns and lanterns, and finally an understanding was arrived at."
1186,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1187,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"The lawyer was considerably battered up, and the family doctor was"
1188,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,sent for to patch him. As the doctor bent over him with
1189,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"sticking-plaster and a bottle of arnica, he said:"
1190,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1191,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"""You'll be out in a day or two, and then I want you to come around and"
1192,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,buy a piano from my brother. The one he is agent for is acknowledged

1973,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,Correcting a Great Injustice
1974,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1975,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,Something has been recently disclosed that will fill every chivalrous
1976,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,man in the country with contrition. For a long time men have supposed
1977,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,that the habit of wearing tall hats at the theater by the ladies was
1978,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,nothing more than a lack of consideration on their part for the
1979,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,unfortunate individuals who were so unlucky as to get a seat behind
1980,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,them.
1981,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1982,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,It now appears that the supposition did the fair sex a great
1983,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,injustice. A noted female physician has exposed an affliction that the
1984,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"female sex has long suffered with, and have succeeded up to this time"
1985,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,in keeping a profound secret. Their habit of wearing hats in places of
1986,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"public entertainment is the result of a necessity, and relieves them"
1987,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"of the charge of selfish disregard of the convenience of others, which"
1988,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,has been so often brought against them.
1989,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1990,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,It appears that ladies who are past thirty-five years of age are
1991,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,peculiarly sensitive to the effect of a bright light striking upon
1992,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,their heads from above. The skull of a woman is quite different from
1993,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"that of a man, especially on the top, and at the age of thirty-five,"
1994,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,the texture of the skull at this place becomes very light. Rays of
1995,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,light--especially electric light--have a peculiarly penetrating and
1996,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,disturbing effect upon the cerebral nerves.
1997,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
1998,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"Strange to say, this infirmity is never felt by a young woman, but as"
1999,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"soon as she passes the heyday of youth, it is at once perceptible. The"
2000,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"fact is generally known to women, and discussed among themselves, but"
2001,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"they have jealously guarded the secret, even from their nearest male"
2002,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,relatives and friends. The lady physician who recently exposed the
2003,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,matter in a scientific journal is the first of her sex to make it
2004,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,known to the public.
2005,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
2006,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"If anyone will take the trouble to make a test of the statement, its"
2007,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,truth will be unquestionably proven. Engage a woman of middle age in
2008,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"conversation beneath a well-lighted chandelier, and in a few moments"
2009,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"she will grow uneasy, and very soon the pain inflicted by the light"
2010,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,will cause her to move away from under its source. On young and
2011,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"healthy girls the rays of light have no perceptible effect. So, when"
2012,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"we see a lady at a theater wearing a tall and cumbersome hat, we"
2013,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"should reflect that she is more than thirty-five years old, and is"
2014,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,simply protecting herself from an affliction that advancing years have
2015,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,brought upon her. Whenever we observe one wearing small and
2016,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"unobtrusive headgear we know that she is still young and charming, and"
2017,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,can yet sit beneath the rays of penetrating light without
2018,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,inconvenience.
2019,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
2020,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,No man who has had occasion to rail against woman's supposed
2021,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"indifference to the public comfort in this respect, will hesitate to"
2022,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,express sincere regret that he has so misunderstood them. It is
2023,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"characteristic of Americans to respect the infirmities of age,"
2024,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"especially among the fair sex, and when the facts here narrated have"
2025,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"been generally known, pity and toleration will take the place of"
2026,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"censure. Henceforth a tall hat, with nodding feathers and clustering"
2027,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"flowers and trimming, will not be regarded with aversion when we see"
2028,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"it between us and the stage, but with respect, since we are assured"
2029,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"that its wearer is no longer young, but is already on the down hill of"
2030,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"life, and is forced to take the precaution that advancing years render"
2031,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,necessary to infirm women.

2041,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"As an illustration, a case might be cited that occurred in Houston."
2042,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,Some months ago a very charming young lady came to this city giving
2043,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"exhibitions in mind reading, and proved herself to be marvelously"
2044,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"gifted in that respect. She easily read the thoughts of the audience,"
2045,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,finding many articles hidden by simply holding the hand of the person
2046,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"secreting them, and read sentences written on little slips of paper by"
2047,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,some at a considerable distance from her.
2048,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
2049,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"A young man in Houston fell in love with her, and married her after a"
2050,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,short courtship. They went to housekeeping and for a time were as
2051,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,happy as mortals can be.
2052,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
2053,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,One evening they were sitting on the porch of their residence holding
2054,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"each other's hands, and wrapt in the close communion of mutual love,"
2055,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,when she suddenly rose and knocked him down the steps with a large

2058,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
2059,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"""You can't fool me,"" she said with flashing eyes. ""You were thinking"

2075,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,Spinsters must be up and doing: 1896 will be the only leap year for
2076,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,the next eight years. Once in every four years the wise men who made
2077,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,the calendar insert an extra day so that the average year will not be
2078,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"so short. Once in every hundred years this extra day is omitted, and a"
2079,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,leap year is also dropped. The year 1900 will not be a leap year.
2080,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"Unmarried ladies who yearn for matrimonial chains, and have been left"
2081,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,standing in the comer by fickle man must get to work. If they fail in
2082,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,landing their prize during 1896 they will have to wait eight years
2083,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,more before they can propose again. Therefore they should work early
2084,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,and late during the present year.
2085,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
2086,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,The following communication pertaining to the subject was received

2093,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"arose this morning at daybreak, resolved to utilize every"

2095,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,received some very valuable advice from you in regard to the
2096,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,exercise of the privileges of my sex (female) during the leap
2097,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"year season. I followed your advice strictly, and in the year"
2098,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,1892 proposed marriage to twenty-seven different men. I am
2099,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"still single, but am not to blame for that. I was engaged to"
2100,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"three men in 1892, and, but for the unforeseen bad luck, would"
2101,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,certainly have married at least one of them. Two of them
2102,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,committed suicide the day before the wedding and the other got
2103,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,his hat and walking cane and went to Patagonia. I see in the
2104,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"papers that the year 1900 will not be a leap year, and I"
2105,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,realize that for the next twelve months I have got to carry on
2106,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"a red hot aggressive campaign, as eight more years will"
2107,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,decidedly weaken my chances. Any suggestions you may make that
2108,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,will aid me will be appreciated. I enclose my photo. I am

2142,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"or some other light subject, until a handkerchief applied to his neck"

2179,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"""I'll tell you, Bill,"" said the politician in a confidential whisper,"

2374,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,When it becomes necessary for an actor to write a letter during the
2375,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"performance of a play, it is a custom to read the words aloud as he"
2376,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,writes them. It is necessary to do this in order that the audience may
2377,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"be apprised of its contents, otherwise the clearness of the plot might"
2378,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"be obscured. The writing of a letter upon the stage, therefore,"
2379,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"generally has an important bearing upon the situation being presented,"
2380,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,and of course the writer is forced to read aloud what he writes for
2381,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"the benefit of the audience. During the production of ""Monbars"" in"
2382,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"Houston some days ago, the gentleman who assumed the character of the"
2383,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,heavy villain took advantage of a situation of this description in a
2384,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,most cowardly manner.
2385,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
2386,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"In the last act, Mantell, as Monbars, writes a letter of vital"
2387,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"importance, and, as customary, reads the lines aloud as he writes"
2388,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,them. The villain hides behind the curtains of a couch and listens in
2389,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,fiendish glee to the contents of the letter as imparted by Mr. Mantell
2390,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,in strict confidence to the audience. He then uses the information

2580,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,It is time to call a halt upon the persistent spreaders of the alleged
2581,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,joke that a woman can not keep a secret. No baser ingratitude has been
2582,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,shown by man toward the fair sex than the promulgation of this false

2586,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,men ever read.
2587,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
2588,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,The truth is that it is only woman who can keep a secret. Only a
2589,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,divine intelligence can understand the marvelous power with which
2590,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,ninety-nine married women out of a hundred successfully hide from the
2591,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,rest of the world the secret that they have bound themselves to
2592,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,something unworthy of the pure and sacrificing love they have given
2593,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,them. She may whisper to her neighbor that Mrs. Jones has turned her

2609,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
2610,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,Adam's conduct would have caused his name to be stricken from the list

2612,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"stood by man, faithful, true, and ready to give up all for his sake."
2613,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"She hides his puny peccadilloes from the world, she glosses over his"

2825,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,truly loved. And the man did so and got two good negatives.
2826,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
2827,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,In the meantime Reuben and Ruth confessed to each other what they had

2841,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,photographs he had taken showed that Reuben's head was full of deep
2842,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,and abiding love for Reuben and Ruth's showed her to be passionately

3122,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,knights one of the poor students with whom she had been in love.
3123,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
3124,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"The knights mounted and rode in a line past the grandstand, and the"

3145,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
3146,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,The two knights fought for two hours and at length the princess's
3147,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,lover prevailed and stretched the other upon the ground. The

3149,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,low in his saddle.
3150,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,
3151,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,On the Princess Astla's cheek was a rosy flush; in her eyes the light
3152,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"of excitement vied with the soft glow of love; her lips were parted,"
3153,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"her lovely hair unbound, and she grasped the arms of her chair and"
3154,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,leaned forward with heaving bosom and happy smile to hear the words of

3249,O. HENRY ON THE HOUSTON _POST_,"The crowd yelled at him to come back, and the desperado flourished his"
