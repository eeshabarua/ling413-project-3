146,INTRODUCTION,
147,INTRODUCTION,
148,INTRODUCTION,_The fifty poems here brought together under the title ‘Poems of Nature’
149,INTRODUCTION,are perhaps two-thirds of those which Thoreau preserved. Many of them
150,INTRODUCTION,"were printed by him, in whole or in part, among his early contributions"
151,INTRODUCTION,"to Emerson’s_ Dial, _or in his own two volumes_, The Week _and_ Walden,"
152,INTRODUCTION,_which were all that were issued in his lifetime. Others were given to
153,INTRODUCTION,"Mr. Sanborn for publication, by Sophia Thoreau, the year after her"
154,INTRODUCTION,brother’s death (several appeared in the_ Boston Commonwealth _in 1863);
155,INTRODUCTION,"or have been furnished from time to time by Mr. Blake, his literary"
156,INTRODUCTION,executor._
157,INTRODUCTION,
158,INTRODUCTION,"_Most of Thoreau’s poems were composed early in his life, before his"
159,INTRODUCTION,"twenty-sixth year, ‘Just now’ he wrote in the autumn of 1841, ‘I am in"
160,INTRODUCTION,"the mid-sea of verses, and they actually rustle round me, as the leaves"
161,INTRODUCTION,"would round the head of Autumnus himself, should he thrust it up"
162,INTRODUCTION,"through some vales which I know; but, alas! many of them are but crisped"
163,INTRODUCTION,"and yellow leaves like his, I fear, and will deserve no better fate than"
164,INTRODUCTION,to make mould for new harvests.’ After 1843 he seems to have written but
165,INTRODUCTION,"few poems, and had destroyed perhaps as many as he had retained, because"
166,INTRODUCTION,"they did not meet the exacting requirements of his friend Emerson, upon"
167,INTRODUCTION,whose opinion at that time he placed great reliance. This loss was
168,INTRODUCTION,"regretted by Thoreau in after years, when the poetical habit had left"
169,INTRODUCTION,"him, for he fancied that some of the verses were better than his friend"
170,INTRODUCTION,"had supposed. But Emerson, who seldom changed his mind, adhered to his"
171,INTRODUCTION,"verdict, and while praising some of the poems highly, perhaps"
172,INTRODUCTION,"extravagantly, would admit but a small number of them to the slight"
173,INTRODUCTION,selection which he appended to the posthumous edition of Thoreau’s_
174,INTRODUCTION,"Letters, _edited by him in 1865; and even these were printed, in some"
175,INTRODUCTION,"instances, in an abbreviated and imperfect form._[1] _A few other"
176,INTRODUCTION,"poems, with some translations from the Greek, have lately been included"
177,INTRODUCTION,by Thoreau’s Boston publishers in their volume of_ Miscellanies (_vol._
178,INTRODUCTION,"x. _of the Riverside Edition, 1894_). _But no collection so full as the"
179,INTRODUCTION,present one has ever been offered to the public._
180,INTRODUCTION,
181,INTRODUCTION,_It has not been attempted to make this a complete collection of
182,INTRODUCTION,"Thoreau’s poems, because, as has been well said, ‘many of them seem to"
183,INTRODUCTION,"be merely pendants to his prose discourse, dropped in as forcible"
184,INTRODUCTION,"epigrams where they are brief, and in other instances made ancillary to"
185,INTRODUCTION,"the idea just expressed, or to perpetuate a distinct conception that has"
186,INTRODUCTION,some vital connection with the point from which it was poured forth. It
187,INTRODUCTION,"is, therefore, almost an injustice to treat them separately at all.’_[2]"
188,INTRODUCTION,"_After the discontinuance of_ The Dial, _Thoreau ceased to publish his"
189,INTRODUCTION,"verses as separate poems, but interpolated them, in the manner"
190,INTRODUCTION,"described, in his prose essays, where they form a sort of accompaniment"
191,INTRODUCTION,"to the thought, and from which it is in many cases impossible to detach"
192,INTRODUCTION,them. That he himself set some value on them in this connection may be
193,INTRODUCTION,"gathered from a sentence in the last of his published letters, in which"
194,INTRODUCTION,he writes to a correspondent: ‘I am pleased when you say that in_ The
195,INTRODUCTION,Week _you like especially those little snatches of poetry interspersed
196,INTRODUCTION,"through the book, for these I suppose are the least attractive to most"
197,INTRODUCTION,readers.’_
198,INTRODUCTION,
199,INTRODUCTION,_Everything that concerns a great writer has its special interest; and
200,INTRODUCTION,"Thoreau’s poetry, whatever its intrinsic value may be, is full of"
201,INTRODUCTION,"personal significance; in fact, as Emerson remarked, ‘his biography is"
202,INTRODUCTION,"in his verses.’ Thus, many of these poems will be found to throw light"
203,INTRODUCTION,"on certain passages of his life. ‘Inspiration,’ for example, is the"
204,INTRODUCTION,record of his soul’s awakening to the new impulse of transcendentalism;
205,INTRODUCTION,the stanzas on ‘Sympathy’ perhaps contain in a thinly disguised form the
206,INTRODUCTION,"story of his youthful love, and the sacrifice which he imposed on"
207,INTRODUCTION,himself to avoid rivalry with his brother; the lines ‘To my Brother’
208,INTRODUCTION,refer to the sudden and tragic death of John Thoreau in 1842; and ‘The
209,INTRODUCTION,"Departure’ is believed to be the poem in which Henry Thoreau, when"
210,INTRODUCTION,"leaving in 1843 the home of Emerson, where he had lived for two years,"
211,INTRODUCTION,took farewell of his friends. The numerous other allusions to the life
212,INTRODUCTION,"and scenery of Concord, with which Thoreau’s own life was so closely"
213,INTRODUCTION,"blended, require no comment or explanation._"
214,INTRODUCTION,
215,INTRODUCTION,"_Thoreau’s view of the poetic character, as stated by him in_ The Week,"
216,INTRODUCTION,"_is illustrative of his own position. ‘A true poem,’ he says, ‘is"
217,INTRODUCTION,"distinguished not so much by a felicitous expression, or any thought it"
218,INTRODUCTION,"suggests, as by the atmosphere which surrounds it. There are two classes"
219,INTRODUCTION,"of men called poets. The one cultivates life, the other art: one seeks"
220,INTRODUCTION,"food for nutriment, the other for flavor; one satisfies hunger, the"
221,INTRODUCTION,other gratifies the palate.’ There can be no doubt to which of these
222,INTRODUCTION,classes Thoreau himself belongs. If metrical skill be insisted on as an
223,INTRODUCTION,"indispensable condition of poetry, he can hardly be ranked among the"
224,INTRODUCTION,"poets; nor, where this criterion was dominant, was it surprising that,"
225,INTRODUCTION,"as one of his contemporaries tells us,_[3] _with reference to his verses"
226,INTRODUCTION,"in_ The Dial, _‘an unquenchable laughter, like that of the gods at"
227,INTRODUCTION,"Vulcan’s limping, went up over his ragged and halting lines.’ But in"
228,INTRODUCTION,the appreciation of poetry there is a good deal more to be considered
229,INTRODUCTION,"than this; and, as the same writer has remarked, there is ‘a frank and"
230,INTRODUCTION,"unpretending nobleness’ in many of Thoreau’s verses, distinguished as"
231,INTRODUCTION,"they are, at their best, by their ripe fulness of thought, quiet gravity"
232,INTRODUCTION,"of tone, and epigrammatic terseness of expression. The title of poet"
233,INTRODUCTION,could hardly be withheld from the author of such truly powerful pieces
234,INTRODUCTION,"as ‘The Fall of the Leaf,’ ‘Winter Memories,’ ‘Smoke in Winter,’ or"
235,INTRODUCTION,‘Inspiration.’_
236,INTRODUCTION,
237,INTRODUCTION,_Nor should it be forgotten that Thoreau was always regarded as a poet
238,INTRODUCTION,by those who were associated with him. ‘Poet-Naturalist’ was the
239,INTRODUCTION,suggestive title which Ellery Channing applied to him; and Hawthorne
240,INTRODUCTION,remarked that ‘his thoughts seem to measure and attune themselves into
241,INTRODUCTION,"spontaneous verse, as they rightfully may, since there is real poetry in"
242,INTRODUCTION,them.’ Even Emerson’s final estimate was far from unappreciative. ‘His
243,INTRODUCTION,"poetry,’ he wrote in his biographical sketch, ‘might be bad or good; he"
244,INTRODUCTION,"no doubt wanted a lyric facility and technical skill, but he had the"
245,INTRODUCTION,source of poetry in his spiritual perception. His own verses are often
246,INTRODUCTION,rude and defective. The gold does not yet run pure--is drossy and crude.
247,INTRODUCTION,The thyme and marjoram are not yet honey. But if he want lyric fineness
248,INTRODUCTION,"and technical merits, if he have not the poetic temperament, he never"
249,INTRODUCTION,"lacks the causal thought, showing that his genius was better than his"
250,INTRODUCTION,talent.’_
251,INTRODUCTION,
252,INTRODUCTION,"_Perhaps what Thoreau said of Quarles, one of that school of gnomic"
253,INTRODUCTION,"poets of which he was a student, might be aptly applied to himself: ‘It"
254,INTRODUCTION,is rare to find one who was so much of a poet and so little of an
255,INTRODUCTION,"artist. Hopelessly quaint, he never doubts his genius; it is only he and"
256,INTRODUCTION,his God in all the world. He uses language sometimes as greatly as
257,INTRODUCTION,"Shakespeare; and though there is not much straight grain in him, there"
258,INTRODUCTION,"is plenty of rough, crooked timber.’ The affinity of Thoreau’s style to"
259,INTRODUCTION,"that of Herbert, Donne, Cowley, and other minor Elizabethans, has often"
260,INTRODUCTION,been remarked; and it has been truly said that the stanzas ‘Sic Vita’
261,INTRODUCTION,might almost have a niche in Herbert’s_ Temple.
262,INTRODUCTION,
263,INTRODUCTION,"_It must be granted, then, that Thoreau, whatever his limitations, had"
264,INTRODUCTION,"the poet’s vision, and sometimes the poet’s divine faculty; and if this"
265,INTRODUCTION,"was manifested more frequently in his masterly prose, it was neither"
266,INTRODUCTION,absent from his verse nor from the whole tenor of his character. It was
267,INTRODUCTION,his destiny to be one of the greatest prose writers whom America has
268,INTRODUCTION,"produced, and he had a strong, perhaps an exaggerated, sense of the"
269,INTRODUCTION,"dignity of this calling. ‘Great prose,’ he thinks, ‘of equal elevation,"
270,INTRODUCTION,"commands our respect more than great verse, since it implies a more"
271,INTRODUCTION,"permanent and level height, a life more pervaded with the grandeur of"
272,INTRODUCTION,"the thought. The poet only makes an irruption, like a Parthian, and is"
273,INTRODUCTION,"off again, shooting while he retreats; but the prose writer has"
274,INTRODUCTION,"conquered, like a Roman, and settled colonies.’_"
275,INTRODUCTION,
276,INTRODUCTION,"_If, therefore, we cannot unreservedly place Thoreau among the poetical"
277,INTRODUCTION,"brotherhood, we may at least recognise that he was a poet in the larger"
278,INTRODUCTION,"sense in which his friends so regarded him--he felt, thought, acted, and"
279,INTRODUCTION,"lived as a poet, though he did not always write as one. In his own"
280,INTRODUCTION,words_--
281,INTRODUCTION,
282,INTRODUCTION,"‘_My life has been the poem I would have writ,_"
283,INTRODUCTION,_But I could not both live and utter it._’
284,INTRODUCTION,
285,INTRODUCTION,"_Such qualities dignify life and make the expression of it memorable,"
286,INTRODUCTION,"not perhaps immediately, to the multitude of readers, but at first to an"
287,INTRODUCTION,"appreciative few, and eventually to a wide circle of mankind._"
