540,A FACE.,"Strange, that a man a generation long"
541,A FACE.,Should do good deeds that mould his generous lips

2135,ANDROMEDA.,Big with the terrible and nameless thing
2136,ANDROMEDA.,That soon along the shrinking sands will crawl
2137,ANDROMEDA.,To wrap me in its hideous embrace.
2138,ANDROMEDA.,I will not struggle! leave me but one hand
2139,ANDROMEDA.,To shield the poor eyes that refuse to close;
2140,ANDROMEDA.,For stretched and wide the fascinated lids
2141,ANDROMEDA.,"Deny their office, and I needs must look!"
2142,ANDROMEDA.,"What have I done, that these fair limbs of mine,"
2143,ANDROMEDA.,"(Nay, nay; I meant not fair; the gods forbid"

2145,ANDROMEDA.,"And tender with soft flesh--O mother, take"

2150,ANDROMEDA.,"Nay, what is this that wraps my shuddering limbs"

2152,ANDROMEDA.,The merciless tall cliff which all day long
2153,ANDROMEDA.,Refused its wonted shadow to protect
2154,ANDROMEDA.,"My burning body from the dazzling sun,"
2155,ANDROMEDA.,"Relents, and spreads its gentle shade around"
2156,ANDROMEDA.,"To calm my reeling senses? Nay, for more"
2157,ANDROMEDA.,"It seems to me like white o’ershadowing wings,"
2158,ANDROMEDA.,Circling above my head. Alas! so dim
2159,ANDROMEDA.,"My poor eyes are with tears, I cannot see"
2160,ANDROMEDA.,What this may be so near me; yet it seems
2161,ANDROMEDA.,"Like some young, gallant knight. Alack, good sir,"
2162,ANDROMEDA.,"If thou art come to free my quivering limbs,"
2163,ANDROMEDA.,Know that against the gods contend in vain
2164,ANDROMEDA.,The bravest knights. And yet how like a god
2165,ANDROMEDA.,"Himself he stands! See how he spurns the ground,"
2166,ANDROMEDA.,"Poised with sustaining wings upon the air,"
2167,ANDROMEDA.,"And deals the monster a sharp, sudden blow"
2168,ANDROMEDA.,That sends him reeling from the trembling shore!
2169,ANDROMEDA.,"Shattered, I hear the chains fall to my feet;"
2170,ANDROMEDA.,Yet much I fear another gentler fate
2171,ANDROMEDA.,"Fetters my heart anew. O valiant knight,"

2173,ANDROMEDA.,(Fair dare I call it now; since thou art near
2174,ANDROMEDA.,To shield me ever from the envious hate
2175,ANDROMEDA.,Of those less fair!) if worth it seemed to thee
2176,ANDROMEDA.,"The dreadful daring of the doubtful fight,"
2177,ANDROMEDA.,Surely that best should be thy dear reward
2178,ANDROMEDA.,Which prompted thee to struggle; all is thine!
2179,ANDROMEDA.,"The dim eyes, dull with weeping bitter tears,"
2180,ANDROMEDA.,Shall brighten at the sound of thy strong voice;
2181,ANDROMEDA.,"The frail hands, red with struggling to be free,"
2182,ANDROMEDA.,Once more shall turn to lilies in thy clasp;
2183,ANDROMEDA.,Rose-red for thee shall flush with happiness
2184,ANDROMEDA.,"The poor, pale cheeks, still white with sickening fear;"
2185,ANDROMEDA.,"The tired feet sustained and strong shall grow,"
2186,ANDROMEDA.,"Walking beside thee; nay, dear love, not yet;"
2187,ANDROMEDA.,"For still they tremble, still I seem to need"
2188,ANDROMEDA.,Thy firm supporting arm around me thrown.
2189,ANDROMEDA.,"Fold me then, dearest, in thy close embrace;"
2190,ANDROMEDA.,"Bear me across the treacherous, yielding sands,"
