43,,
44,,This edition of the `Select Poems of Sidney Lanier' is issued
45,,"in the hope of making his poetry known to wider circles than hitherto,"
46,,especially among the students of our high-schools and colleges.
47,,"To these as to older people, the poems will, it is believed,"
48,,prove an inspiration from the stand-point both of literature and of life.
49,,
50,,The biographical section of the Introduction rests in the main
51,,upon Dr. Ward's admirable `Memorial' prefixed to the `Poems of Sidney Lanier'
52,,"edited by his wife, though a few additional facts have been gleaned"
53,,here and there.  For most* of the Bibliography down to 1888 I am indebted
54,,"to my Hopkins comrade, Dr. Richard E. Burton, now of Hartford, Conn.,"
55,,"who compiled one for the `Memorial of Sidney Lanier',"
56,,"published by President Gilman, of the Johns Hopkins University, in 1888."
57,,Obligations to other publications about Lanier are in every instance
58,,acknowledged in the appropriate place.
59,,
60,,--
61,,"* I say `most of the Bibliography down to 1888', because Dr. Burton's"
62,,different purpose led him to exclude items that could not be omitted
63,,"in a Bibliography that, like mine, tries to be complete."
64,,--
65,,
66,,"As to the selections made, I wished to include `The Marshes of Glynn'"
67,,"and yet not to exclude `Sunrise'.  But both could not be put in,"
68,,"and I finally gave the preference to `Sunrise', chiefly on the ground"
69,,of its being Lanier's latest complete poem.*  I believe all will admit
70,,that the poems selected fairly exemplify the genius of the poet.
71,,"The poems are arranged, not as in the complete edition,"
72,,"but in their chronological order, the only proper one, I think,"
73,,"for a text-book.  Of course, they are all given complete."
74,,
75,,--
76,,"* Later opinion generally agrees that ""The Marshes of Glynn"""
77,,"is Lanier's greatest poem, and as this edition has no limitations of space,"
78,,it would be inappropriate to exclude it.  Therefore it has been inserted
79,,"more or less in chronological order (in accordance with Callaway's plan),"
80,,"with some comments.  -- Alan Light, 1998."
81,,--
82,,
83,,In the Notes I have made rather copious quotations from poems
84,,"familiar to English scholars, because I hope that this book"
85,,"will go into the hands of many to whom they are not familiar,"
86,,and to whom the original texts are not easily accessible.
87,,"And yet, if they at all attain their end, the Notes must lead one"
88,,"to wish to know more of English poetry, of which Lanier's is but a part."
89,,
90,,Among the friends that have helped me by counsel or otherwise
91,,"I gratefully name Mr. Clifford Lanier, brother of the poet;"
92,,"Professor Wm. Hand Browne, of the Johns Hopkins University;"
93,,"Dr. Charles H. Ross, of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute;"
94,,"and my colleagues in the School of English in the University of Texas,"
95,,Mr. L. R. Hamberlin and Professor Leslie Waggener.
96,,"Chief-justice Logan E. Bleckley, of Georgia, a man of letters"
97,,"as well as of law, very kindly put at my use his correspondence with the poet,"
98,,"the original draft of `Corn', and his criticisms upon the same."
99,,"My chief indebtedness, however, is to Mrs. Sidney Lanier,"
100,,who has been most generous with her time and her husband's papers.

160,,
161,,(1842-1881)
162,,
163,,
164,,
165,,Sidney Lanier has so recently passed from us that it seems desirable
166,,briefly to recount the chief incidents of his life.  This task
167,,"is much lightened by Dr. Wm. Hayes Ward's `Memorial',* upon which,"
168,,"as stated in the Preface, is based this section of my essay."
169,,"Born at Macon, Ga., February 3, 1842, Sidney Lanier came of a family"
170,,noted for their love and cultivation of the fine arts.
171,,"From the time of Queen Elizabeth to the Restoration,"
172,,several of his paternal ancestors were connected with the English court
173,,"as musical composers and as painters.  The father of the poet, however,"
174,,"Robert S. Lanier, was a most industrious lawyer, who,"
175,,"after a lingering illness of three years, recently** answered `Adsum'"
176,,"to the summons of the supreme tribunal.  The poet's mother, Mary Anderson,"
177,,"a Virginian of Scotch descent, likewise sprang from a family"
178,,"distinguished for their love of oratory, music, and poetry."
179,,
180,,--
181,,* For the full title of works cited see `Bibliography'.
182,,"** October 20, 1893, at Macon, Ga."
183,,--
184,,
185,,With such an ancestry we are not surprised to learn that
186,,"Sidney's earliest passion was for music, and that in boyhood he could,"
187,,"although untutored, play on almost every kind of instrument.  He preferred"
188,,"the violin, in playing which he sometimes sank into a deep trance,"
189,,"but in deference to his father's view gave it up for the flute,"
190,,"his power over which we shall hear of farther on.  At first,"
191,,"strange to say, he considered music unworthy of one's sole attention,"
192,,but later he came to rank it as his fullest expression of worship.
193,,
194,,"At fourteen Sidney entered the Sophomore Class of Oglethorpe College,"
195,,"near Macon, Ga., and, with a year's intermission, graduated with first honor"
196,,"in 1860, when just eighteen.  To Professor James Woodrow, of Oglethorpe,"
197,,"now President of South Carolina College, Lanier declared"
198,,"that he owed ""the strongest and most valuable stimulus of his youth."""
199,,"On graduating he was given a tutorship in his Alma Mater,"
200,,a position that he held until the outbreak of the Civil War.
201,,
202,,The lecture-room was now exchanged for the battle-field;
203,,"in April, 1861, Lanier entered the Confederate Army as a private"
204,,"in the Macon Volunteers of the Second Georgia Battalion,"
205,,an organization among the first to reach Norfolk and that still keeps up
206,,its corporate existence.  In the spring of 1862 Lanier was joined
207,,"by his young brother, Clifford; and throughout the war"
208,,each seemed to vie with the other in brotherly love;
209,,"for, while both were offered promotion, neither would accept it,"
210,,since to do so would have entailed separation from the other.
211,,The leisure time of his first year's service Sidney spent
212,,in the study of music and the modern languages.  He was engaged
213,,"in several battles in Virginia, but afterward was transferred,"
214,,"with Clifford, to the Signal Service, with head-quarters at Petersburg."
215,,"Here he had access to a small library, of which he made sedulous use."
216,,"In 1863 his company was mounted, and served in Virginia and North Carolina."
217,,"In the spring of 1864 both brothers were transferred to Wilmington,"
218,,"the head-quarters of the Marine Signal Service, in which they remained"
219,,"to the end of the war.  Finally the two brothers were separated,"
220,,each becoming signal officer* of a blockade-runner.  Sidney's vessel
221,,"was captured, and for five months he was a prisoner at Point Lookout, Md.,"
222,,"with nothing but his flute to solace him.  It was the exposure of prison-life,"
223,,"no doubt, that first led to decline of health by developing"
224,,"the seeds of consumption, a disease that was to carry off his mother"
225,,and that he was to struggle with the last fifteen years of his life.
226,,"Released from prison in February, 1865, he returned to Georgia,"
227,,"for the most part afoot, and reached home March 15th."
228,,"An account of his war-life is given in his novel, `Tiger-lilies',"
229,,treated below.
230,,
231,,--
232,,* It is sometimes erroneously stated that each was put in charge
233,,of a blockade-runner.
234,,--
235,,
236,,During the succeeding nine years (1865-73) his life was checkered indeed.
237,,"Seriously ill for six weeks, he arose from his bed to see"
238,,his mother carried off by consumption and to find himself suffering
239,,"with congestion of the lungs.  Slightly relieved, Lanier turned his hand"
240,,to various projects for making a living:  clerking in a hotel
241,,"in Montgomery, Ala., for two years; writing* and publishing his novel,"
242,,"`Tiger-lilies'; teaching at Prattville, Ala., one year, during which time**"
243,,"he married Miss Mary Day, of Macon, Ga.; studying and then practising law"
244,,"with his father at Macon, Ga., for five years; now, in the winter of 1872-73,"
245,,"trying to recuperate at San Antonio, Texas, for hemorrhages had begun in 1868,"
246,,"and a cough had set in two years later; and, finally, settling in Baltimore,"
247,,"December, 1873, to devote himself to music and literature."
248,,
249,,--
250,,"* April, 1867."
251,,"** December 19, 1867."
252,,--
253,,
254,,Against the son's devotion of his life to music and literature
255,,"the father protested, chiefly on business grounds, and begged him"
256,,to rejoin himself in the practice of the law.  Thanking his father
257,,"for his thoughtfulness, Lanier justified his own course"
258,,"in these earnest words:  ""My dear father, think how, for twenty years,"
259,,"through poverty, through pain, through weariness, through sickness,"
260,,through the uncongenial atmosphere of a farcical college
261,,"and of a bare army and then of an exacting business life,"
262,,through all the discouragement of being wholly unacquainted
263,,"with literary people and literary ways -- I say, think how,"
264,,in spite of all these depressing circumstances and of a thousand more
265,,"which I could enumerate, these two figures of music and poetry"
266,,have steadily kept in my heart so that I could not banish them.
267,,"Does it not seem to you as to me, that I begin to have the right"
268,,"to enroll myself among the devotees of these two sublime arts,"
269,,"after having followed them so long and so humbly, and through"
270,,"so much bitterness?""*1*  Of course, the father yielded and did all"
271,,"that his slender means would allow toward keeping up his son,"
272,,who henceforth devoted every energy to music and literature.
273,,"Despite continued ill-health, which now and again necessitated"
274,,"visits of months' duration to Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia,"
275,,Lanier did a vast amount of work.  He was engaged as first flute
276,,"for the Peabody Symphony Concerts, a position that he filled"
277,,"with rare distinction for six years.  As to his literary work,"
278,,"this began with the publication of his novel, `Tiger-lilies', in 1867,"
279,,"and in the same year, of occasional poems in `The Round Table' of New York."
280,,"`Corn', published in `Lippincott's Magazine' (Philadelphia)"
281,,"for February, 1875, is the first of his poems that attracted general notice,"
282,,and the one that gained him the friendship of Bayard Taylor.
283,,"To Taylor he owed his selection to write the `Centennial Cantata',"
284,,"which gave him still greater notoriety, though, to be sure,"
285,,some of it was not very grateful to him.  In 1876 the Lippincotts published
286,,"his `Florida', and in 1877 his first volume of `Poems',"
287,,which contained ninety-four pages and consisted chiefly of pieces*2*
288,,"previously published in the magazines.  Soon after settling in Baltimore,"
289,,"Lanier made a careful study of Old and Middle English, the fruits of which"
290,,he partially embodied in courses of lectures given to his private class
291,,"and to the public, the latter at the Peabody Institute, in 1879."
292,,"During these years, too, he had been steadily turning out poems of high order."
293,,"On his birthday, February 3, in 1879, he received notice of his appointment"
294,,as Lecturer on English Literature at the Johns Hopkins University of Baltimore
295,,"for the ensuing scholastic year, with a fixed salary, the first since"
296,,"his marriage.  In the summer of 1879 he wrote his `Science of English Verse',"
297,,which constituted the basis of his first course of lectures
298,,"at the Johns Hopkins University.  Notwithstanding serious illness,"
299,,"this same winter, 1879-80, he lectured at three private schools"
300,,and kept up his musical engagement at the Peabody Concerts.
301,,"The next winter, 1880-81, he came near dying, but still kept writing"
302,,(`Sunrise' was written with a fever temperature of 104 Degrees)
303,,"and went through his twelve lectures at the Hopkins, afterwards embodied"
304,,in `The English Novel'.  How trying this must have been to him
305,,can be gathered from the following words of Mr. Ward:
306,,"""A few of the earlier lectures he penned himself; the rest he was obliged"
307,,"to dictate to his wife.  With the utmost care of himself,"
308,,"going in a closed carriage and sitting during his lecture,"
309,,his strength was so exhausted that the struggle for breath
310,,in the carriage on his return seemed each time to threaten the end.
311,,"Those who heard him listened in a sort of fascinated terror, as in doubt"
312,,"whether the hoarded breath would suffice to the end of the hour.""*3*"
313,,After this a trip was made to New York to arrange for issuing some books
314,,"for boys, and four were issued, two posthumously:  `Boy's Froissart' (1878),"
315,,"`Boy's King Arthur' (1880), `Boy's Mabinogion' (1881),"
316,,"and `Boy's Percy' (1882).  Another work, an account of North Carolina"
317,,"similar to that of Florida, was contracted for and was definitely planned,"
318,,"but, owing to aggravating infirmities, could not be completed."
319,,

323,,"*3* Ward's `Memorial', p. xxviii."
324,,--
325,,
326,,For the end was near at hand.  Desperate illness had made it necessary
327,,"to seek relief near Asheville, N.C., where he was joined"
328,,"by Mrs. Lanier and by his father and step-mother.  Growing no better,"
329,,"he was moved to Lynn, Polk County, N.C.  Of the rest we shall hear"
330,,"in the words of his wife:  ""We are left alone (it is August 29, 1881)"
331,,with one another.  On the last night of the summer comes a change.
332,,His love and immortal will hold off the destroyer of our summer
333,,"yet one more week, until the forenoon of September 7th, and then falls"
334,,"the frost, and that unfaltering will renders its supreme submission to"
335,,"the will of God.""*  Unusually checkered his life had been, and yet for Lanier"
336,,"as for Timrod poetry (and music) had ""turned life's tasteless waters"
337,,"into wine, and flushed them through and through with purple tints.""**"
338,,"The body was taken to Mr. Lanier's home in Baltimore, thence to"
339,,"the Church of St. Michael and All Angels, where services were conducted"
340,,"by the rector, the Rev. Dr. William Kirkus.  It was then buried"
341,,"in Greenmount Cemetery, in the lot of Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Turnbull,"
342,,two of the dearest friends that Mr. and Mrs. Lanier had in Baltimore.
343,,

346,,"** Timrod's `A Vision of Poesy', stanza xliv."
347,,--
348,,
349,,Mr. Lanier left a family consisting of his wife and four sons.
350,,"Mrs. Lanier, who lives at Tryon, N.C., was the inspiration"
351,,"not only of those glorious tributes, `Laus Mariae' and `My Springs',"
352,,"but also of the poet's whole life.  The eldest son, Mr. Charles Day Lanier,"
353,,"was born at Macon, Ga., September 12, 1868, and was graduated A.B."
354,,at the Johns Hopkins University in 1888.  At one time he was
355,,"Assistant Editor of `The Cosmopolitan Magazine', a position that he gave up"
356,,"only to become Business Manager of `The Review of Reviews',"
357,,with which he has been connected from its beginning.
358,,He is the author of several graceful sketches in the magazines.
359,,"The second son, Sidney, is passionately fond of music,"
360,,and would have devoted himself thereto but for life-long ill-health.
361,,"After teaching three years in West Virginia, he has started a fruit farm"
362,,"at Tryon, N.C., where he hopes to build up his health."
363,,"The third son, Henry Wysham, was prevented from entering the Johns Hopkins"
364,,"by a partial failure of sight, and for three years has devoted himself"
365,,"to railroad engineering in Baltimore and in Jamaica.  The youngest,"
366,,"Robert Sampson, only fourteen, is at Tryon, N.C., with his mother."
367,,
368,,"That interest in Lanier's life and work did not cease with his death,"
369,,"there is abundant evidence.  On October 22, 1881, a memorial meeting was held"
370,,"by the Faculty and students of the Johns Hopkins University, at which"
371,,"addresses*1* were made by President Gilman and Professor Wm. Hand Browne,"
372,,"of the University, and by the Rev. Dr. William Kirkus, of Baltimore,"
373,,"and a letter*1* was read from the poet-critic, Edmund C. Stedman,"
374,,"of New York.  In 1883 `The English Novel' was published,"
375,,"and in 1884 the `Poems', edited by his wife, with the excellent `Memorial'"
376,,"by Dr. Wm. Hayes Ward, who declared that he thought Lanier"
377,,"would ""take his final rank with the first princes of American song.""*2*"
378,,"Numerous reviews of his life and works were published, notably those"
379,,"by Mr. Wm. R. Thayer, Dr. Merrill E. Gates, Professor Charles W. Kent,"
380,,"and by the London `Spectator'.  On February 3, 1888,"
381,,"the Johns Hopkins University held another memorial meeting in Baltimore,"
382,,"attended by many from other cities.  ""A bust of the poet, in bronze"
383,,"(modelled by Ephraim Keyser, sculptor, in the last period of Lanier's life,"
384,,"at the suggestion of Mr. J. R. Tait), was presented to the University"
385,,"by his kinsman, Charles Lanier, Esq., of New York.  It was also announced that"
386,,"a citizen of Baltimore had offered a pedestal, to be cut in Georgia marble"
387,,from a design by Mr. J. B. N. Wyatt.  On a temporary pedestal
388,,"hung the flute of Lanier, which had so often been his solace,"
389,,and a roll of his manuscript music.  The bust was crowned
390,,"with a wreath of laurel; the words of Lanier, `The Time needs Heart',"
391,,"were woven into the strings of a floral lyre; and other flowers,"
392,,"likewise brought by personal friends, were grouped around the pedestal."
393,,"As a memento a card, designed by Mrs. Henry Whitman, of Boston,"
394,,"was given to those who were present.  Upon its face was a wreath,"
395,,"with Lanier's name and the date, and the motto -- `Aspiro dum Exspiro';"
396,,"upon the reverse appeared the closing lines of the Hymn of the Sun,"
397,,"taken from the poet's `Hymns of the Marshes' -- and beneath,"
398,,"a flute with ivy twined about it.""*3*  The exercises,"
399,,"which were interspersed with music, were as follows:"
400,,addresses by President Gilman of the Hopkins and President Gates of Rutgers
401,,"(now of Amherst); selections from Lanier's poetry, read by"
402,,"Miss Susan Hayes Ward, of Newark, N.J.; a paper on Lanier's"
403,,"`Science of English Verse', by Professor A. H. Tolman, of Ripon College, Wis."
404,,"(now of the University of Chicago); poetic tributes by Mrs. Lawrence Turnbull,"
405,,"Miss Edith M. Thomas, and Messrs. James Cummings, Richard E. Burton,"
406,,"and John B. Tabb; and letters from Messrs. Richard W. Gilder,"
407,,"Edmund C. Stedman, and James Russell Lowell -- all of which may be found"
408,,"in President Gilman's dainty `Memorial of Sidney Lanier'.  Again,"
409,,"a replica of the above-mentioned bust, the gift also of Mr. Charles Lanier,"
410,,"was unveiled at the poet's birthplace, Macon, Ga., on October 17, 1890;"
411,,on which occasion tender tributes*4* were again poured forth
412,,"in prose and verse, by Messrs. W. B. Hill, Hugh V. Washington,"
413,,"Charles Lanier, Clifford Lanier, Wm. Hand Browne, Charles G. D. Roberts,"
414,,"John B. Tabb, H. S. Edwards, Wm. H. Hayne, Charles W. Hubner,"
415,,"Joel Chandler Harris, Charles Dudley Warner, and Daniel C. Gilman."
416,,"But more significant than these demonstrations, perhaps,"
417,,is the steadily growing study devoted to Lanier's works.
418,,"Mr. Higginson*5* tells us, for instance, that, when he wrote his tribute"
419,,"in 1887, Lanier's `Science of English Verse' had been put"
420,,"upon the list of Harvard books to be kept only a fortnight,"
421,,"and that, according to the librarian, it was out ""literally all the time."""
422,,"Moreover, it would not be difficult to cite various poems"
423,,"that have been more or less modeled upon Lanier's; it is sufficient, perhaps,"
424,,"to point out that the marsh, a theme almost unknown to poetry before Lanier"
425,,"immortalized it, is not infrequently the subject of poetic treatment now,"
426,,"as in the works of Charles G. D. Roberts,*6* Clinton Scollard,*7*"
427,,"and Maurice Thompson.*8*  It is noteworthy, too, that many of"
428,,"the younger poets of the day, both in Canada and the United States,"
429,,have sung Lanier's praise.  A complete list is given in the `Bibliography'.
430,,"Still further, a devoted admirer, Mrs. Lawrence Turnbull, of Baltimore,"
431,,"in `The Catholic Man', has in the person of Paul, the poet,"
432,,given us an imaginative study of the character of Mr. Lanier.

451,,II.   Lanier's Prose Works
452,,
453,,
454,,
455,,"With this brief sketch of his life, let us turn to Lanier's works,"
456,,"and first to those in prose.  At the head of the list comes `Tiger-lilies',"
457,,"a novel written within three weeks and published immediately thereafter,"
458,,"in 1867.  Under the figure of ""a strange, enormous, terrible flower,"""
459,,"the seed of which he hopes may perish beyond resurrection, the author pictures"
460,,the horror of war in general and of the Civil War in particular.
461,,"An entertaining love-story runs through the book, the plot of which"
462,,space does not allow me to detail.  In execution the novel has grave defects:
463,,it lacks unity; the characters talk as learnedly as Lanier afterward
464,,"wrote of music; and at times, as in the oft-quoted picture of the war,*1*"
465,,the style is grandiloquent; owing to which blemishes the author
466,,"wisely discouraged its republication.  But, in spite of these defects,"
467,,"the book has one very strongly put scene,*2* the interview"
468,,"between Smallin and his deserter brother, and several beautiful passages*3*"
469,,that distinctly proclaim the high-souled poet.

473,,"*2* `Tiger-lilies', p. 149 ff."
474,,"*3* That on ""love"" (p. 26) is quoted later."
475,,--
476,,
477,,"Lanier's next publication, `Florida:  Its Scenery, Climate, and History',"
478,,"was written by commission of the Atlantic Coast Line, and appeared in 1876."
479,,"To use the author's own epithet, `Florida' is ""a spiritualized guide-book""."
480,,
481,,"Exclusive of the 1877 volume of `Poems', Lanier's next original work"
482,,"was `The Science of English Verse', which in lecture-form"
483,,was delivered to the students of the Johns Hopkins in the winter of 1879
484,,"and was published in 1880.  According to competent critics, the book gives"
485,,as searching an investigation of the science of verse on its formal side
486,,as is to be had in any language.  Since the treatise is so evidently
487,,"an epoch-making one, I regret that the technicality of the subject forbids"
488,,my attempting in this connection even a brief exposition* of its principles.
489,,I can say only that Lanier treats verse in the terms of music;
490,,"that, according to the promise of the preface, he gives"
491,,"""an account of the true relations of music and verse""; and that in so doing"
492,,he has given us the best working theory for English verse
493,,"from Caedmon to Tennyson.  This is a high estimate, but it is by no means"
494,,"so high as that of the lamented poet-professor, Edmund Rowland Sill,"
495,,"who said of `The Science of English Verse', ""It is the only work"
496,,that has ever made any approach to a rational view of the subject.
497,,"Nor are the standard ones overlooked in making this assertion.""**"
498,,
499,,--
500,,"* This may be found in Professor Tolman's article,"
501,,cited in the `Bibliography'.
502,,** Quoted by Tolman.
503,,--
504,,
505,,"Lanier's second course of lectures at the Johns Hopkins University,"
506,,"delivered in the winter and spring of 1881, was published in 1883"
507,,"under the title, `The English Novel and the Principles of Its Development'.*"
508,,"According to the author's statement, the purpose of the book"
509,,"is ""first, to inquire what is the special relation of the novel"
510,,"to the modern man, by virtue of which it has become a paramount literary form;"
511,,"and, secondly, to illustrate this abstract inquiry, when completed,"
512,,"by some concrete readings in the greatest of modern English novelists"" (p. 4)."
513,,"Addressing himself to the former, Lanier attempts to prove (1) that our time,"
514,,"when compared with that of Aeschylus, shows an ""enormous growth"
515,,"in the personality of man"" (p. 5); (2) that what we moderns"
516,,"call Physical Science, Music, and the Novel, all had their origin at"
517,,"practically the same time, about the middle of the seventeenth century (p. 9);"
518,,"and (3) ""that the increase of personalities thus going on has brought about"
519,,such complexities of relation that the older forms of expression
520,,were inadequate to them; and that the resulting necessity
521,,has developed the wonderfully free and elastic form of the modern novel
522,,"out of the more rigid Greek drama, through the transition form"
523,,"of the Elizabethan drama"" (p. 10).  In fulfilment of his second purpose,"
524,,"the author gives a detailed study of several of the novels of George Eliot,"
525,,whom he takes to be the greatest modern English novelist.  Even this
526,,"brief synopsis of the book must indicate its broad and stimulating character,"
527,,in which respect it is a worthy successor of `The Science of English Verse'.
528,,"Despite the limitations induced by failing life, which necessitated"
529,,"the cutting down of the course of lectures from twenty to twelve,**"
530,,I know of few more life-giving books; and I venture to assert
531,,that it cannot safely be overlooked by any careful student of the subject.
532,,
533,,--
534,,* Mrs. Lanier informs me that `The English Novel' will soon
535,,"be issued in an amended form and with a new sub-title,"
536,,"`Studies in the Development of Personality', which indicates precisely"
537,,"what Mr. Lanier intended to attempt, and relieves the book"
538,,of its seeming incompleteness as to scope.

541,,
542,,"Among other prose works I may mention Lanier's early extravaganza,"
543,,"`Three Waterfalls'; `Bob', a happy account of a pet mocking-bird,"
544,,worthy of being placed beside Dr. Brown's `Rab and his Friends';
545,,"his books for boys:  `Froissart', `King Arthur', `Mabinogion', and `Percy',"
546,,"which have had, as they deserve, a large sale; and his posthumous"
547,,"`From Bacon to Beethoven', a highly instructive essay on music."

551,,
552,,III.  Lanier's Poetry:  Its Themes
553,,
554,,
555,,
556,,"But it is chiefly as a poet that we wish to consider Lanier,"
557,,and I turn to the posthumous edition of his `Poems' gotten out by his wife.
558,,"At the outset let us ask, How did the poet look at the world?"
559,,what problems engaged his attention and how were they solved?
560,,"A careful investigation will show, I believe, that,"
561,,"despite the brevity of his life and its consuming cares,"
562,,"Lanier studied the chief questions of our age, and that in his poems"
563,,he has offered us noteworthy solutions.
564,,
565,,"What, for instance, is more characteristic of our age than its tendency"
566,,to agnosticism?  I pass by the manifestations of this spirit
567,,"in the world of religion, of which so much has been heard,"
568,,and give an illustration or two from the field of history and politics.
569,,"Picturesque Pocahontas, we are told, is no more to be believed in;"
570,,"moreover, the Pilgrim Fathers did not land at Plymouth Rock,"
571,,nor did Jefferson write the Declaration of Independence.  Which way we turn
572,,"there is a big interrogation-point, often not for information"
573,,"but for negation.  Of the good resulting from the inquisitive spirit,"
574,,we all know; of the baneful influence of inquisitiveness
575,,"that has become a mere intellectual pastime or amateurish agnosticism,"
576,,we likewise have some knowledge; but the evil side of this tendency
577,,"has seldom been put more forcibly, I think, than in this stanza"
578,,from Lanier's `Acknowledgment':
579,,
580,,"""O Age that half believ'st thou half believ'st,"
581,,"Half doubt'st the substance of thine own half doubt,"
582,,"And, half perceiving that thou half perceiv'st,"
583,,"Stand'st at thy temple door, heart in, head out!"
584,,"Lo! while thy heart's within, helping the choir,"
585,,"Without, thine eyes range up and down the time,"
586,,"Blinking at o'er-bright Science, smit with desire"
587,,"To see and not to see.  Hence, crime on crime."
588,,"Yea, if the Christ (called thine) now paced yon street,"
589,,Thy halfness hot with his rebuke would swell;
590,,Legions of scribes would rise and run and beat
591,,"His fair intolerable Wholeness twice to hell.""*"
592,,
593,,--
594,,"* `Acknowledgment', ll. 1-12."
595,,--
596,,
597,,"More hurtful than agnosticism, because affecting larger masses of people,"
598,,"is the rapid growth of the mercantile spirit during the present century,"
599,,especially in America.  This evil the poet saw most clearly
600,,"and felt most keenly, as every one may learn by reading `The Symphony',"
601,,his great poem in which the speakers are the various musical instruments.
602,,The violins begin:
603,,
604,,"""O Trade! O Trade! would thou wert dead!"
605,,"The Time needs heart -- 'tis tired of head.""*"
606,,
607,,Then all the stringed instruments join with the violins in giving
608,,"the wail of the poor, who ""stand wedged by the pressing of Trade's hand"":"
609,,
610,,"""`We weave in the mills and heave in the kilns,"
611,,"We sieve mine-meshes under the hills,"
612,,"And thieve much gold from the Devil's bank tills,"
613,,"To relieve, O God, what manner of ills? --"
614,,"The beasts, they hunger, and eat, and die;"
615,,"And so do we, and the world's a sty;"
616,,"Hush, fellow-swine:  why nuzzle and cry?"
617,,"""Swinehood hath no remedy"""
618,,"Say many men, and hasten by,"
619,,Clamping the nose and blinking the eye.
620,,"But who said once, in the lordly tone,"
621,,"""Man shall not live by bread alone"
622,,"But all that cometh from the throne""?"
623,,Hath God said so?
624,,"But Trade saith ""No"":"
625,,"And the kilns and the curt-tongued mills say ""Go:"
626,,"There's plenty that can, if you can't:  we know."
627,,"Move out, if you think you're underpaid."
628,,The poor are prolific; we're not afraid;
629,,"Trade is Trade.""'"
630,,
631,,"""Thereat this passionate protesting"
632,,"Meekly changed, and softened till"
633,,It sank to sad requesting
634,,And suggesting sadder still:
635,,"`And oh, if men might some time see"
636,,How piteous-false the poor decree
637,,That trade no more than trade must be!
638,,"Does business mean, ""Die, you -- live, I""?"
639,,"Then ""Trade is trade"" but sings a lie:"
640,,'Tis only war grown miserly.
641,,"If business is battle, name it so.'""**"
642,,
643,,--
644,,"* `The Symphony', ll. 1-2."
645,,"** `The Symphony', ll. 31-61."
646,,--
647,,
648,,Of even wider sweep than mercantilism is the spirit of intolerance;
649,,"for, while the diffusion of knowledge and of grace has in a measure"
650,,"repressed this spirit, it lacks much of being subdued.  I do not wonder"
651,,"that Lanier ""fled in tears from men's ungodly quarrel about God,"""
652,,"and that, in his poem entitled `Remonstrance', he denounces intolerance"
653,,with all the vehemence of a prophet of old.
654,,
655,,But Lanier had an eye for life's beauties as well as its ills.
656,,To him music was one of earth's chief blessings.  Of his early passion
657,,"for the violin and his substitution of the flute therefor,"
658,,we have already learned.  According to competent critics he was possibly
659,,"the greatest flute-player*1* in the world, a fact all the more interesting"
660,,"when we remember that, as he himself tells us,*2* he never had a teacher."
661,,With such a talent for music the poet has naturally strewn his pages
662,,"with fine tributes thereto.  In `Tiger-lilies', for instance,"
663,,"he tells us that, while explorers say that they have found"
664,,"some nations that had no god, he knows of none that had no music,"
665,,"and then sums up the matter in this sentence:  ""Music means harmony;"
666,,"harmony means love; and love means -- God!""*3*  Even more explicit"
667,,"is this declaration in a letter of May, 1873, to Hayne:  ""I don't know"
668,,that I've told you that whatever turn I may have for art is purely MUSICAL;
669,,poetry being with me A MERE TANGENT INTO WHICH I SHOOT SOMETIMES.
670,,"I could play passably on several instruments before I could write legibly,"
671,,"and SINCE then the very deepest of my life has been filled with music,"
672,,"which I have studied and cultivated far more than poetry.""*4*"
673,,We have already seen incidentally that in his `Symphony'
674,,the speakers are musical instruments; and it is in this poem that occurs
675,,"his felicitous definition,"
676,,
677,,"""Music is love in search of a word.""*5*"
678,,
679,,In `To Beethoven' he describes the effect of music upon himself:
680,,
681,,"""I know not how, I care not why,"
682,,"Thy music brings this broil at ease,"
683,,And melts my passion's mortal cry
684,,In satisfying symphonies.
685,,
686,,"""Yea, it forgives me all my sins,"
687,,"Fits life to love like rhyme to rhyme,"
688,,And tunes the task each day begins
689,,"By the last trumpet-note of Time.""*6*"
690,,
691,,"It was this profound knowledge of music, of course, that enabled Lanier"
692,,"to write his work on `The Science of English Verse', and gave him"
693,,a technical skill in versification akin to that of Tennyson.
694,,
695,,--
696,,"*1* See Ward's `Memorial', pp. xx, xxxi."
697,,*2* Hayne's (P. H.) `A Poet's Letters to a Friend'.
698,,"*3* `Tiger-lilies', p. 32."
699,,*4* Hayne's `A Poet's Letters to a Friend'.  After settling in Baltimore
700,,"Lanier devoted more time to poetry than to music, as we may see"
701,,"from this sentence to Judge Bleckley, in his letter of March 20, 1876:"
702,,"""As for me, life has resolved simply into a time during which"
703,,I must get upon paper as many as possible of the poems
704,,"with which my heart is stuffed like a schoolboy's pocket."""
705,,"*5* `The Symphony', l. 368."
706,,"*6* `To Beethoven', ll. 61-68."
707,,--
708,,
709,,"Like most great poets of modern times, Lanier was a sincere lover of nature."
710,,And it seems to me that with him this love was as all-embracing as
711,,with Wordsworth.  Lanier found beauty in the waving corn*1* and the clover;*2*
712,,"in the mocking-bird,*3* the robin,*4* and the dove;*5*"
713,,"in the hickory,*6* the dogwood,*6* and the live-oak;*7*"
714,,in the murmuring leaves*8* and the chattering streams;*9*
715,,"in the old red hills*10* and the sea;*11* in the clouds,*12*"
716,,"sunrise,*13* and sunset;*14* and even in the marshes,*15*"
717,,"which ""burst into bloom"" for this worshiper.  Again, Lanier's love of nature"
718,,was no less insistent than Wordsworth's.  We all remember the latter's
719,,oft-quoted lines:
720,,
721,,"""To me the meanest flower that blows can give"
722,,"Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears;""*16*"
723,,
724,,"and beside them one may put this line of Lanier's,"
725,,
726,,"""The little green leaves would not let me alone in my sleep,""*17*"
727,,
728,,"because, as the context shows, he was"
729,,
730,,"""Shaken with happiness:"
731,,"The gates of sleep stood wide.""*18*"
732,,
733,,And how naive and tender was this nature-worship!  He speaks of
734,,"the clover*19* and the clouds*20* as cousins, and of the leaves*21*"
735,,"as sisters, and in so doing reminds us of the earliest Italian poetry,"
736,,"especially of `The Canticle of the Sun', by St. Francis of Assisi,"
737,,"who brothers the wind, the fire, and the sun, and sisters the water,"
738,,"the stars, and the moon.  Notice the tenderness in these lines of `Corn':"
739,,
740,,"""The leaves that wave against my cheek caress"
741,,Like women's hands; the embracing boughs express
742,,A subtlety of mighty tenderness;
743,,"The copse-depths into little noises start,"
744,,"That sound anon like beatings of a heart,"
745,,"Anon like talk 'twixt lips not far apart;""*22*"
746,,
747,,"to which we find a beautiful parallel in a poem by Paul Hamilton Hayne,"
748,,himself a reverent nature-worshiper:
749,,
750,,"""Ah! Nature seems"
751,,Through something sweeter than all dreams
752,,"To woo me; yea, she seems to speak"
753,,"How closely, kindly, her fond cheek"
754,,"Rested on mine, her mystic blood"
755,,"Pulsing in tender neighborhood,"
756,,"And soft as any mortal maid,"
757,,"Half veiled in the twilight shade,"
758,,Who leans above her love to tell
759,,"Secrets almost ineffable!""*23*"
760,,
761,,"Moreover, this worship is restful:"
762,,
763,,"""Oh, what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea?"
764,,Somehow my soul seems suddenly free
765,,"From the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin,"
766,,By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn.
767,,
768,,.    .    .    .    .
769,,
770,,"""By so many roots as the marsh-grass sends in the sod"
771,,I will heartily lay me a-hold on the greatness of God:
772,,"Oh, like to the greatness of God is the greatness within"
773,,"The range of the marshes, the liberal marshes of Glynn.""*24*"
774,,
775,,But to Lanier the ministration of nature was by no means passive;
776,,and we find him calling upon the leaves actively to minister to his need
777,,and even to intercede for him to their Maker:
778,,
779,,"""Ye lispers, whisperers, singers in storms,"
780,,"Ye consciences murmuring faiths under forms,"
781,,"Ye ministers meet for each passion that grieves,"
782,,"Friendly, sisterly, sweetheart leaves,"
783,,"Oh, rain me down from your darks that contain me"
784,,"Wisdoms ye winnow from winds that pain me, --"
785,,Sift down tremors of sweet-within-sweet
786,,"That advise me of more than they bring, -- repeat"
787,,Me the woods-smell that swiftly but now brought breath
788,,"From the heaven-side bank of the river of death, --"
789,,"Teach me the terms of silence, -- preach me"
790,,"The passion of patience, -- sift me, -- impeach me, --"
791,,"And there, oh there"
792,,"As ye hang with your myriad palms upturned in the air,"
793,,"Pray me a myriad prayer.""*25*"

830,,
831,,"To take up his next theme, Lanier, like every true Teuton,"
832,,"from Tacitus to the present, saw ""something of the divine"" in woman."
833,,It was this feeling that led him so severely to condemn a vice that is said
834,,"to be growing, the marriage for convenience.  I quote from `The Symphony',"
835,,"and the ""melting Clarionet"" is speaking:"
836,,
837,,"""So hath Trade withered up Love's sinewy prime,"
838,,Men love not women as in olden time.
839,,"Ah, not in these cold merchantable days"
840,,"Deem men their life an opal gray, where plays"
841,,The one red sweet of gracious ladies'-praise.
842,,"Now, comes a suitor with sharp prying eye --"

844,,"Come, heart for heart -- a trade?  What! weeping? why?'"
845,,"Shame on such wooer's dapper-mercery!""*1*"
846,,
847,,"And then follows a wooing that, to my mind, should be irresistible, and that,"
848,,"at any rate, is quite as high-souled as Browning's `One Way of Love',"
849,,which I have long considered the high-water-mark of the chivalrous in love.
850,,The Lady Clarionet is still speaking:
851,,
852,,"""I would my lover kneeling at my feet"
853,,"In humble manliness should cry, `O Sweet!"
854,,I know not if thy heart my heart will greet:
855,,I ask not if thy love my love can meet:
856,,"Whate'er thy worshipful soft tongue shall say,"
857,,"I'll kiss thine answer, be it yea or nay:"
858,,"I do but know I love thee, and I pray"
859,,"To be thy knight until my dying day.'""*2*"
860,,
861,,"I imagine, too, that any wife that ever lived would be satisfied"
862,,"with his glorious tribute to Mrs. Lanier in `My Springs', which closes thus:"
863,,
864,,"""Dear eyes, dear eyes, and rare complete --"

872,,"Thy Perfect stops th' Imperfect's argument.""*4*"
873,,
874,,But the cleverest thing that Lanier has written of woman

878,,Dost bind all epochs in one dainty fact.

880,,"I leapt the breadth of time in loving thee!""*5*"

892,,--
893,,
894,,"To Lanier there was but one thing that made life worth living,"
895,,and that was love.  Even the superficial reader must be struck
896,,"with the frequent use of the term in the poet's works,"
897,,while all must be uplifted by his conception of its purpose and power.
898,,"The ills of agnosticism, mercantilism, and intolerance"
899,,"all find their solution here and here only, as is admirably set forth"
900,,"in `The Symphony', of which the opening strain is, ""We are all for love,"""
901,,"and the closing, ""Love alone can do.""  The matter is no less happily put"
902,,"in `Tiger-lilies':  ""For I am quite confident that love is the only rope"
903,,thrown out by Heaven to us who have fallen overboard into life.
904,,"Love for man, love for woman, love for God, -- these three chime"
905,,"like bells in a steeple and call us to worship, which is to work. . . ."
906,,"Inasmuch as we love, in so much do we conquer death and flesh;"
907,,"by as much as we love, by so much are we gods.  For God is love;"
908,,"and could we love as He does, we could be as He is.""*1*"
909,,To the same effect is his statement in `The English Novel':
910,,"""A republic is the government of the spirit.""*2*  The same thought"
911,,"recurs later:  ""In love, and love only, can great work"
912,,"that not only pulls down, but builds, be done; it is love, and love only,"
913,,"that is truly constructive in art.""*3*  In the poem entitled"

917,,"there can be no Hell, since, in the words of Tolstoi's story,"
918,,"""Where Love is there is God.""  But in one of his poems Lanier sums up"
919,,the whole matter in a line:
920,,
921,,"""When life's all love, 'tis life:  aught else, 'tis naught.""*4*"

930,,"It is but a short way from love to its source, -- God."
931,,"And, as Lanier was continually in the atmosphere of the one, so, I believe,"
932,,"he was ever in the presence of the other; for the poet's ""Love means God"""
933,,"is but another phrasing of the evangelist's ""God is love"".*1*"
934,,Of Lanier's grief over church broils and of his longing for freedom
935,,"to worship God according to one's own intuition, we have already learned"
936,,from his `Remonstrance'.  What he thought of the Christ we learn
937,,"from `The Crystal', which closes with this invocation:"
938,,
939,,"""But Thee, but Thee, O sovereign Seer of time,"
940,,"But Thee, O poets' Poet, Wisdom's Tongue,"
941,,"But Thee, O man's best Man, O love's best Love,"
942,,"O perfect life in perfect labor writ,"
943,,"O all men's Comrade, Servant, King, or Priest, --"
944,,"What IF or YET, what mole, what flaw, what lapse,"
945,,"What least defect or shadow of defect,"
946,,"What rumor, tattled by an enemy,"
947,,"Of inference loose, what lack of grace"
948,,"Even in torture's grasp, or sleep's, or death's --"
949,,"Oh, what amiss may I forgive in Thee,"
950,,"Jesus, good Paragon, Thou Crystal Christ?""*2*"
951,,
952,,How tenderly Lanier was touched by the life of our Lord may be seen
953,,"in his `Ballad of Trees and the Master', a dramatic presentation of the scene"
954,,in Gethsemane and on Calvary.  How implicit was his trust in the Christ
955,,may be gathered from this paragraph in a letter to the elder Hayne:
956,,"""I have a boy whose eyes are blue as your `Aethra's'.  Every day"
957,,"when my work is done I take him in my strong arms, and lift him up,"
958,,"and pore in his face.  The intense repose, penetrated somehow"
959,,"with a thrilling mystery of `potential activity', which dwells"
960,,"in his large, open eye, teaches me new things.  I say to myself,"
961,,"Where are the strong arms in which I, too, might lay me and repose,"
962,,and yet be full of the fire of life?  And always through the twilight
963,,"come answers from the other world, `Master! Master! there is one -- Christ --"
964,,"in His arms we rest!'""*3*  Perhaps, however, Lanier's notion of God,"
965,,"whom he declared*4* all his roads reached, is most clearly expressed"
966,,"in a scrap quoted by Ward, apparently the outline for a poem:"
967,,"""I fled in tears from the men's ungodly quarrel about God."
968,,"I fled in tears to the woods, and laid me down on the earth."
969,,Then somewhat like the beating of many hearts came up to me out of the ground;
970,,"and I looked and my cheek lay close to a violet.  Then my heart took courage,"
971,,"and I said:  `I know that thou art the word of my God, dear Violet."
972,,"And oh, the ladder is not long that to my heaven leads."
973,,Measure what space a violet stands above the ground.  'Tis no further climbing
974,,"that my soul and angels have to do than that.'""*5*  In this high spirituality"
975,,"Lanier is in line with the greatest poets of our race, from"
976,,
977,,"""Caedmon, in the morn"
978,,A-calling angels with the cow-herd's call
979,,"That late brought up the cattle,""*6*"

983,,"""Who never turned his back, but marched breast forward,"
984,,"Never doubted clouds would break,"

1050,,IV.   Lanier's Poetry:  Its Style
1051,,
1052,,
1053,,
1054,,So much for the poet's thoughts; what shall we say of their expression?
1055,,"In other words, is Lanier the literary artist equal to Lanier the seer?"
1056,,"In order the better to answer this question, let us begin at the beginning,"
1057,,"with the elements of style, some of which, however, I pass by"
1058,,as not calling for special comment.
1059,,
1060,,Of Lanier's felicitous choice of words we have already had
1061,,"incidental illustration; but it is desirable, perhaps, to group here"
1062,,"a few of his happiest phrases, to show that, as Lowell*1* said,"
1063,,"he is ""a man of genius with a rare gift for the happy word."""
1064,,Notice this speech about the brook:
1065,,
1066,,"""And down the hollow from a ferny nook"
1067,,"`Lull' sings a little brook!""*2*"
1068,,
1069,,and this of the well-bucket:
1070,,
1071,,"""The rattling bucket plumps"
1072,,"Souse down the well;""*3*"
1073,,
1074,,and this of the outburst of a bird:
1075,,
1076,,"""Dumb woods, have ye uttered a bird?""*4*"
1077,,
1078,,and the description of a mocking-bird as
1079,,
1080,,"""Yon trim Shakspere on the tree;""*5*"
1081,,
1082,,and of midnight as
1083,,
1084,,"""Death's and truth's unlocking time.""*6*"
1085,,
1086,,"Moreover, it should be observed that Lanier frequently uses"
1087,,"significant compounds, -- a habit acquired, no doubt,"
1088,,"from his study of Old English, in which, as in German, such compounds abound."
1089,,
1090,,--
1091,,*1* See `Lowell' in `Bibliography'.
1092,,"*2* `From the Flats', ll. 23-24; cited by Gates.  [Line 24 was changed"
1093,,"(to ""Bright leaps a living brook!"") in later editions.  -- A. L., 1998.]"
1094,,"*3* `Clover', ll. 29-30."
1095,,"*4* `Sunrise', l. 57; cited by Gates."
1096,,"*5* `The Mocking-Bird', l. 14."
1097,,"*6* `The Crystal', l. 1.  Other illustrations may be found in the paragraph"
1098,,on figures of speech.
1099,,--
1100,,
1101,,"While in the main Lanier's sentence-construction is good,"
1102,,"occasionally his sentences are too long, as in `My Springs',"
1103,,"`To Bayard Taylor', and `Sunrise', in which we have sentences"
1104,,"longer than the opening one in `Paradise Lost', and, what is of more moment,"
1105,,"not so well balanced, and hence affording fewer breathing spaces."
1106,,"That this detracts from clearness and euphony both, every reader will admit."
1107,,
1108,,"To come to the figures of speech, one must be struck at once"
1109,,with the delicacy and the vigor of Lanier's imagination.  The poet's fancy
1110,,personifies what at first blush seems to us incapable of personification.
1111,,Thus at one time*1* he likens men to clover-leaves and the Course-of-things
1112,,"to the browsing ox, which makes way with the clover-heads;"
1113,,while at another he addresses an old red hill of Georgia as
1114,,
1115,,"""Thou gashed and hairy Lear"
1116,,"Whom the divine Cordelia of the year,"
1117,,"E'en pitying Spring, will vainly strive to cheer.""*2*"
1118,,
1119,,"Like other Southern poets,*3* Lanier sometimes fails to check his imagination,"
1120,,"and in consequence leaves his readers ""bramble-tangled in a brilliant maze,"""
1121,,as in his description of the stars in `June Dreams'*4*
1122,,"and in the `Psalm of the West'.*5*  While I do not like a maze,"
1123,,"brilliant though it be and sweet, I must say that I prefer"
1124,,"the embarrassment of riches to the embarrassment of poverty.  On the whole,"
1125,,"however, Lanier's figures strike me as singularly fresh and happy."
1126,,"In `Sunrise', for example, the poet speaks of the marsh as follows:"
1127,,
1128,,"""The tide's at full:  the marsh with flooded streams"
1129,,"Glimmers a limpid labyrinth of dreams;""*6*"
1130,,
1131,,and of the heavens reflected in the marsh waters:
1132,,
1133,,"""Each winding creek in grave entrancement lies"
1134,,A rhapsody of morning-stars.  The skies
1135,,"Shine scant with one forked galaxy, --"
1136,,"The marsh brags ten:  looped on his breast they lie.""*7*"
1137,,
1138,,"Later, as the ebb-tide flows from marsh to sea, we are parenthetically treated"
1139,,to these two lines:
1140,,
1141,,"""Run home, little streams,"
1142,,"With your lapfuls of stars and dreams.""*8*"
1143,,
1144,,"Finally, the heaven itself is thus pictured:"
1145,,
1146,,"""Now in each pettiest personal sphere of dew"
1147,,The summ'd morn shines complete as in the blue
1148,,"Big dew-drop of all heaven;""*9*"
1149,,
1150,,beside which must be hung this exquisite picture:
1151,,
1152,,"""The dew-drop morn may fall from off the petal of the sky.""*10*"
1153,,
1154,,--
1155,,*1* In `Clover'.
1156,,"*2* `Corn', ll. 185-187."

1158,,"in his admirable life of `Simms' (Boston, 1892), p. 149."

1165,,"*10* `The Ship of Earth', l. 5."
1166,,--
1167,,
1168,,"As to versification, Lanier uses almost all the types of verse"
1169,,"-- iambic, trochaic, blank, the sonnet, etc. -- and with about equal skill."
1170,,"Three features, however, specially characterize his verse:"
1171,,the careful distribution of vowel-colors and the frequent use
1172,,"of alliteration and of phonetic syzygy,*1* by which last is meant"
1173,,"a combination or succession of identical or similar consonants,"
1174,,"whether initially, medially, or finally, as for instance"
1175,,the succession of M's in Tennyson's
1176,,
1177,,"""The moan of doves in immemorial elms"
1178,,"And murmuring of innumerable bees."""
1179,,
1180,,All of these phenomena are illustrated in Lanier's
1181,,"`Song of the Chattahoochee', which has often been compared"
1182,,"to Tennyson's `The Brook', and which alone proves the author"
1183,,"a master in versification.  To be sure, Lanier occasionally gives us"
1184,,"an improper rhyme, as `thwart:  heart',*2* etc., but so does every poet."
1185,,"No doubt, too, his love of music sometimes led him,"
1186,,"not ""to strain for form effects"", but to indulge too much therein,"
1187,,"or, in the words of Mr. Stedman, ""to essay in language"
1188,,"feats that only the gamut can render possible.""*3*  But, as Professor Kent"
1189,,"admirably puts it, ""Lanier was a poet as well as an artist,"
1190,,"and if at times his artistic temperament seemed to eclipse his poetic thought,"
1191,,grant that to the poet mind the very manner of expression
1192,,"may indicate the thought that lies beneath, while to the duller ear"
1193,,"the thought must come in completed form.""*4*  Moreover, as we shall see later,"
1194,,this extraordinary musical endowment gave Lanier a unique position
1195,,among English poets.
1196,,
1197,,--
1198,,"*1* See `The Science of English Verse', p. 306 ff."
1199,,"*2* `In the Foam', ll. 6, 8.  See, too, Kent's `Study of Lanier's Poems',"
1200,,which gives an exhaustive treatment of Lanier's versification.
1201,,"*3* Stedman's `Poets of America', p. 449."
1202,,"*4* `Kent', p. 60."
1203,,--
1204,,
1205,,After what has been said the qualities of style may be briefly handled.
1206,,"As we have already seen, Lanier sometimes fails in clearness,"
1207,,"or, more precisely, in simplicity.  This comes partly"
1208,,"from infelicitous sentence-construction, partly, perhaps,"
1209,,"from Lanier's extraordinary musical endowment, but chiefly, I think,"
1210,,from over-luxuriance of imagination.  But this occasional defect
1211,,has been unduly exaggerated.  Thus Mr. Gosse*1* declares
1212,,"that Lanier is ""never simple, never easy, never in one single lyric"
1213,,"natural and spontaneous for more than one stanza,"" -- a statement"
1214,,"so clearly hyperbolic as hardly to call for notice.  As a matter of fact,"
1215,,Lanier has written numerous poems that offer little or no difficulty
1216,,"to the reader of average intelligence, as `Life and Song', `My Springs',"
1217,,"`The Symphony', `The Mocking-Bird', `The Song of the Chattahoochee',"
1218,,"`The Waving of the Corn', `The Revenge of Hamish', `Remonstrance',"
1219,,"`A Ballad of Trees and the Master', etc.  More than this,"
1220,,Lanier at times manifests the simplicity that is granted
1221,,"only to genius of the highest order:  thus an English critic,*2*"
1222,,who by the way declares that Lanier's volume has more of genius than
1223,,"all the poems of Poe, or Longfellow, or Lowell (the humorous poems excepted),"
1224,,"and who considers Lanier the most original of all American poets,"
1225,,"and more original than any England has produced for the last thirty years,"
1226,,"says that ""nothing can be more perfect than --"
1227,,
1228,,`The whole sweet round
1229,,"Of littles that large life compound,'""*3*"
1230,,
1231,,"lines in `My Springs', and that ""the touch of wonder in the last two lines,"
1232,,
1233,,"`I marvel that God made you mine,"
1234,,"For when he frowns, 'tis then ye shine,'*4*"
1235,,
1236,,"is as simple and exquisite as any touch of tenderness in our literature."""
1237,,"I frankly admit that several of Lanier's best poems,"
1238,,"as `Corn', `The Marshes of Glynn', and `Sunrise', are not simple;"
1239,,but the same thing is true of Milton's `Paradise Lost' and of Browning's
1240,,"`The Ring and the Book', and yet this fact does not exclude these two works"
1241,,"from the list of great poems.  Mr. Gosse, however, declares that `Corn',"
1242,,"`Sunrise', and `The Marshes of Glynn' ""simulate poetic expression"
1243,,"with extraordinary skill.  But of the real thing, of the genuine"
1244,,"traditional article, not a trace""!  What do these poems show, then?"
1245,,"Mr. Gosse answers:  ""I find a painful effort, a strain and rage,"
1246,,"the most prominent qualities in everything he wrote;"" which strikes me"
1247,,"as the reverse of the facts.  In one of his letters*5* to Judge Bleckley,"
1248,,"Lanier wrote this sentence:  ""My head and my heart are both so full of poems"
1249,,which the dreadful struggle for bread does not give me time
1250,,"to put on paper, that I am often driven to headache and heartache,"
1251,,"purely for want of an hour or two to hold a pen.""  If, then,"
1252,,"he committed an error (and I am far from considering him faultless),"
1253,,"it was not that he beat and spurred on Pegasus, but that he failed"
1254,,"to rein him in.  Still, I repeat that I prefer the embarrassment of riches"
1255,,"to the embarrassment of poverty.  Finally, just as Milton tells us"
1256,,"that the music of the spheres is not to be heard by the gross, unpurged ear,"
1257,,so I believe that many intelligent ears and eyes are at first
1258,,"too gross to hear and see what Lanier puts before them,"
1259,,whereas a bit of patient listening and looking reveals delights
1260,,hitherto undreamed of.

1283,,"Of the poet's marvelous euphony, `The Song of the Chattahoochee'"
1284,,"speaks clearly enough.  As we have seen in our treatment of versification,"
1285,,it is here a question not of too little but of too much.
1286,,"But, despite an occasional too great yielding to his passion for music,"
1287,,his extraordinary endowment in this direction gave Lanier a unique position
1288,,among English poets.  I quote again from Professor Kent:*
1289,,"""But if his sense of beauty made him a peer of our great poets,"
1290,,it was the heavenly gift of music that distinguished him from them.
1291,,"Milton, it is true, whom he most resembles in this respect,"
1292,,"had a knowledge of music, but not the same passion for it.  Milton's music"
1293,,"was more a recreation, an accompaniment of reverie; Lanier's was a fiery zeal;"
1294,,"a yearning love, a chosen and adequate form of expression"
1295,,of his soul's deepest feeling.  Combined with this passion for music
1296,,"was his technical knowledge of the art, and these combined formed at once"
1297,,the foundation and the framework of his poetry.  He seems literally
1298,,"to have sung his poems; they are essentially musical, tuneful, and melodious."
1299,,"Surcharged with music, he overflows in mellifluous numbers.  Here, then,"
1300,,"Lanier stands out differentiated in the choir of poets, and here we find"
1301,,"that distinctive quality which is the very flavor of his writing."""

1314,* P. 62.,In discussing his love of nature we have seen that he was a pantheist

1324,* P. 62.,"Few passages are more pathetic, I think, than that, in `June Dreams"
1325,* P. 62.,"in January', telling of the poet's struggle for bread and fame,"
1326,* P. 62.,"while ""his worshipful sweet wife sat still, afar, within the village"

1354,* P. 62.,
1355,* P. 62.,
1356,* P. 62.,
1357,* P. 62.,"It is now time to say a word about Lanier's theory of art,"
1358,* P. 62.,especially the art of poetry.  His views upon the formal side of poetry have
1359,* P. 62.,"already been noticed in the consideration of his `Science of English Verse',"
1360,* P. 62.,and hence receive no further comment here.
1361,* P. 62.,
1362,* P. 62.,"That Lanier keenly appreciated the responsibility resting upon the artist,"
1363,* P. 62.,"appears from `Individuality', where he tells us,"
1364,* P. 62.,
1365,* P. 62.,"""Awful is art because 'tis free,""*1*"
1366,* P. 62.,
1367,* P. 62.,"and,"
1368,* P. 62.,
1369,* P. 62.,"""Each artist -- gift of terror! -- owns his will.""*2*"
1370,* P. 62.,
1371,* P. 62.,But he accepts the responsibility reverently and confidently:
1372,* P. 62.,
1373,* P. 62.,"""I work in freedom wild,"
1374,* P. 62.,"But work, as plays a little child,"
1375,* P. 62.,"Sure of the Father, Self, and Love, alone.""*3*"

1381,* P. 62.,--
1382,* P. 62.,
1383,* P. 62.,"Again, the province of poetry is pointed out, as in `Clover':"
1384,* P. 62.,
1385,* P. 62.,"""The artist's market is the heart of man;"
1386,* P. 62.,"The artist's price, some little good of man;""*1*"
1387,* P. 62.,
1388,* P. 62.,and in `The Bee':
1389,* P. 62.,
1390,* P. 62.,"""Wilt ask, `What profit e'er a poet brings?'"
1391,* P. 62.,He beareth starry stuff about his wings
1392,* P. 62.,"To pollen thee and sting thee fertile.""*2*"
1393,* P. 62.,
1394,* P. 62.,"In `Corn',*3* too, the ""tall corn-captain"" ""types the poet-soul sublime."""

1396,* P. 62.,--
1397,* P. 62.,"*1* `Clover', ll. 126-127."

1400,* P. 62.,--
1401,* P. 62.,
1402,* P. 62.,But it is in his prose works that Lanier has treated the matter
1403,* P. 62.,"most at length, and to these I turn.  In the first place,"
1404,* P. 62.,"he insists that to be an artist one must know a great deal,"
1405,* P. 62.,a statement that would appear superfluous but for its frequent overlooking
1406,* P. 62.,by would-be artists.  Hence he is right in warning young writers:
1407,* P. 62.,"""You need not dream of winning the attention of sober people with your poetry"
1408,* P. 62.,unless that poetry and your soul behind it are informed and saturated
1409,* P. 62.,"with at least the largest final conceptions of current science.""*"
1410,* P. 62.,"That Lanier strove to follow this precept, we have abundant evidence"
1411,* P. 62.,"in his life and in his works; and I think that, if we remember"
1412,* P. 62.,"his environments, we must wonder at the vastness, the accuracy,"
1413,* P. 62.,"and the variety of his knowledge.  As additionally illustrative of the last,"
1414,* P. 62.,"I may add that Lanier invented some improvements for the flute,"
1415,* P. 62.,and made a discovery in the physics of music that the Professor of Physics
1416,* P. 62.,in the University of Virginia thought considerable.**
1417,* P. 62.,
1418,* P. 62.,--
1419,* P. 62.,"* `Gates', p. 29."
1420,* P. 62.,"** See `West', p. 23."
1421,* P. 62.,--
1422,* P. 62.,
1423,* P. 62.,"In the second place, Lanier thinks that a poet's knowledge of his art"
1424,* P. 62.,should be scientific.  It was this that led him to write
1425,* P. 62.,"`The Science of English Verse', the motto of which is,"
1426,* P. 62.,"""But the best conceptions cannot be, save where science and genius are."""
1427,* P. 62.,"In `The English Novel' he declares that ""not a single verse"
1428,* P. 62.,"was ever written by instinct alone since the world began,""*"
1429,* P. 62.,"and fortifies his statement by Ben Jonson's tribute to Shakespeare, --"
1430,* P. 62.,
1431,* P. 62.,"""For a good poet's made as well as born,"
1432,* P. 62.,"And such wert thou."""
1433,* P. 62.,
1434,* P. 62.,But Lanier clearly saw that no formal laws and no amount
1435,* P. 62.,"of scientific knowledge could alone make a poet, as appears from the motto"
1436,* P. 62.,"above quoted, from the closing chapter of `The Science of English Verse',"
1437,* P. 62.,"which tells us that the educated love of beauty is the artist's only law,"
1438,* P. 62.,"and from this other motto, from Sir Philip Sidney:  ""A Poet,"
1439,* P. 62.,"no industrie can make, if his owne Genius bee not carried unto it."""
1440,* P. 62.,
1441,* P. 62.,--
1442,* P. 62.,"* `The English Novel', p. 33."
1443,* P. 62.,--
1444,* P. 62.,
1445,* P. 62.,"In the third place, Lanier holds that a moral intention on the part"
1446,* P. 62.,of an artist does not interfere with the naturalness or intrinsic beauty
1447,* P. 62.,of his work; that in art the controlling consideration is rather moral
1448,* P. 62.,"than artistic beauty; but that moral beauty and artistic beauty,"
1449,* P. 62.,"so far from being distinct or opposed, are convergent and mutually helpful."
1450,* P. 62.,This thesis he upholds in the following eloquent and cogent passage:
1451,* P. 62.,"""Permit me to recall to you in the first place that the requirement"
1452,* P. 62.,has been from time immemorial that wherever there is contest
1453,* P. 62.,"as between artistic and moral beauty, unless the moral side prevail,"
1454,* P. 62.,all is lost.  Let any sculptor hew us out the most ravishing combination
1455,* P. 62.,of tender curves and spheric softness that ever stood for woman;
1456,* P. 62.,"yet if the lip have a certain fulness that hints of the flesh,"
1457,* P. 62.,"if the brow be insincere, if in the minutest particular the physical beauty"
1458,* P. 62.,"suggest a moral ugliness, that sculptor -- unless he be portraying"
1459,* P. 62.,a moral ugliness for a moral purpose -- may as well give over his marble
1460,* P. 62.,"for paving-stones.  Time, whose judgments are inexorably moral, will not"
1461,* P. 62.,accept his work.  For indeed we may say that he who has not yet perceived
1462,* P. 62.,how artistic beauty and moral beauty are convergent lines which run back
1463,* P. 62.,"into a common ideal origin, and who therefore is not afire"
1464,* P. 62.,"with moral beauty just as with artistic beauty -- that he, in short,"
1465,* P. 62.,who has not come to that stage of quiet and eternal frenzy
1466,* P. 62.,"in which the beauty of holiness and the holiness of beauty mean one thing,"
1467,* P. 62.,"burn as one fire, shine as one light, within him; he is not yet"
1468,* P. 62.,"the great artist.""*  By copious quotations Lanier then shows"
1469,* P. 62.,"that ""many fine and beautiful souls appear after a while"
1470,* P. 62.,"to lose all sense of distinction between these terms, Beauty, Truth, Love,"
1471,* P. 62.,"Wisdom, Goodness, and the like,"" and concludes thus:  ""And if this be true,"
1472,* P. 62.,"cannot one say with authority to the young artist, -- whether working"
1473,* P. 62.,"in stone, in color, in tones, or in character-forms of the novel:"
1474,* P. 62.,so far from dreading that your moral purpose will interfere
1475,* P. 62.,"with your beautiful creation, go forward in the clear conviction"
1476,* P. 62.,"that unless you are suffused -- soul and body, one might say --"
1477,* P. 62.,with that moral purpose which finds its largest expression in love
1478,* P. 62.,"-- that is, the love of all things in their proper relation --"
1479,* P. 62.,"unless you are suffused with this love, do not dare to meddle with beauty;"
1480,* P. 62.,"unless you are suffused with beauty, do not meddle with love;"
1481,* P. 62.,"unless you are suffused with truth, do not dare to meddle with goodness; --"
1482,* P. 62.,"in a word, unless you are suffused with beauty, truth, wisdom, goodness,"
1483,* P. 62.,"AND love, abandon the hope that the ages will accept you as an artist.""**"

1498,* P. 62.,
1499,* P. 62.,
1500,* P. 62.,
1501,* P. 62.,Milton has somewhere said that in order to be a great poet
1502,* P. 62.,"one must himself be a true poem, a dictum none the less trustworthy"
1503,* P. 62.,because of its inapplicability to its author along with
1504,* P. 62.,"several other great poets.  Now of all English poets,"
1505,* P. 62.,I know of none that came nearer being a true poem than did Lanier.
1506,* P. 62.,"He was as spotless as ""the Lady of Christ's"", and infinitely more lovable."
1507,* P. 62.,"Indeed, he seems to me to have realized the ideal of his own knightly Horn,"
1508,* P. 62.,"who hopes that some day men will be ""maids in purity"".*"
1509,* P. 62.,I will not recall his gentle yet heroic life amid drawbacks
1510,* P. 62.,almost unparalleled; for it is even sadder than it is beautiful.
1511,* P. 62.,"It is my deliberate judgment that, while, as the poet says"
1512,* P. 62.,"in his `Life and Song', no singer has ever wholly lived"
1513,* P. 62.,"his minstrelsy, Lanier came so near it that we may fairly say,"
1514,* P. 62.,"in the closing lines of the poem,"
1515,* P. 62.,
1516,* P. 62.,"""His song was only living aloud,"
1517,* P. 62.,"His work, a singing with his hand."""

1525,* P. 62.,
1526,* P. 62.,And yet I will not close with this picture of the man; for my purpose
1527,* P. 62.,"is rather to present the poet.  Hampered though he was by fewness of years,"
1528,* P. 62.,"by feebleness of body, by shortness of bread, and, most of all perhaps,"
1529,* P. 62.,"by over-luxuriance of imagination, Lanier was yet, to my mind,"
1530,* P. 62.,indisputably a great poet.  For in technique he was akin to Tennyson;*
1531,* P. 62.,"in the love of beauty and in lyric sweetness, to Keats and Shelley;"
1532,* P. 62.,"in the love of nature, to Wordsworth; and in spirituality, to Ruskin,"
1533,* P. 62.,the gist of whose teaching is that we are souls temporarily having bodies;
1534,* P. 62.,"to Milton, ""God-gifted organ-voice of England""; and to Browning,"
1535,* P. 62.,"""subtlest assertor of the soul in song"".  To be sure, Lanier's genius"
1536,* P. 62.,"is not equal to that of any one of the poets mentioned,"
1537,* P. 62.,"but I venture to believe that it is of the same order, and, therefore,"
1538,* P. 62.,deserving of lasting remembrance.
1539,* P. 62.,
1540,* P. 62.,--
1541,* P. 62.,"* Mr. Thayer puts it stronger:  ""As a master of melodious metre"

1544,* P. 62.,"""`The Symphony' of Lanier may recall some parts of `Maud';"
1545,* P. 62.,but the younger poet's treatment is as much his own

1547,* P. 62.,"indeed, only deepen the impression of his originality,"
1548,* P. 62.,which is his most striking quality.  It may be doubted
1549,* P. 62.,"if any English poet of our time, except Tennyson, has cast his work"
1550,* P. 62.,"in an ampler mould, or wrought with more of freedom, or stamped his product"
1551,* P. 62.,"with the impress of a stronger personality.  His thought, his stand-point,"
1552,* P. 62.,"his expression, his form, his treatment, are his alone; and through them all"

2670,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in the commercial and social world and the need in each of the love-spirit.
2671,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,These questions preyed on the poet's mind and were to be treated at length
2672,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"in `The Jacquerie' also, which he expected to make his great work,"
2673,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,but which he was unable to complete.  This he tells us in a noble passage
2674,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"to Judge Bleckley, in his letter of November 15, 1874.  After deploring"
2675,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"the lack of time for literary labor (see quotation in `Introduction',"
2676,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"p. xlvi [Part IV]), he continues:  ""I manage to get a little time tho'"
2677,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"to work on what is to be my first `magnum opus', a long poem,"
2678,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,founded on that strange uprising in the middle of the fourteenth century
2679,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"in France, called `The Jacquerie'.  It was the first time"
2680,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,that the big hungers of `the People' appear in our modern civilization;
2681,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,and it is full of significance.  The peasants learned
2682,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,from the merchant potentates of Flanders that a man who could not be
2683,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"a lord by birth, might be one by wealth; and so Trade arose,"
2684,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,and overthrew Chivalry.  Trade has now had possession of the civilized world
2685,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"for four hundred years:  it controls all things, it interprets the Bible,"
2686,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,it guides our national and almost all our individual life with its maxims;
2687,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,and its oppressions upon the moral existence of man have come to be
2688,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,ten thousand times more grievous than the worst tyrannies of the Feudal System
2689,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"ever were.  Thus in the reversals of time, it is NOW the GENTLEMAN"
2690,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"who must rise and overthrow Trade.  That chivalry which every man has,"
2691,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"in some degree, in his heart; which does not depend upon birth,"
2692,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"but which is a revelation from God of justice, of fair dealing,"
2693,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,of scorn of mean advantages; which contemns the selling of stock which
2694,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"one KNOWS is going to fall, to a man who BELIEVES it is going to rise,"
2695,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,as much as it would contemn any other form of rascality or of injustice
2696,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,or of meanness; -- it is this which must in these latter days
2697,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,organize its insurrections and burn up every one of the cunning moral castles

2701,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,
2702,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,Mr. F. F. Browne is doubtless right in saying that `The Symphony' recalls
2703,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"parts of Tennyson's `Maud', but the closest congeners of `The Symphony'"
2704,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"in English are, I think, Langland's `Piers The Plowman' in poetry"
2705,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,and Ruskin's `Unto This Last' in prose.  Widely as these two works
2706,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,"differ from `The Symphony' in form, they are one with it"
2707,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in purpose and in spirit.  All three voice the outcry of the poor
2708,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,against the hardness of their lot and their longing for a larger life;
2709,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,all three show that the only hope of relief lies in a broader and deeper

3608,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",but let us try to catch the means by which the effect is in part produced.
3609,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?","In five stanzas, of ten lines each, alliteration occurs in all"
3610,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?","save twelve lines.  In eleven of these twelve lines internal rhyme occurs,"

3612,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",Syzygy is used for the same purpose.  Of the letters occurring in the poem
3613,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",about one-fifth are liquids and about one-twelfth are sibilants.
3614,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",The effect of the whole is musical beyond description.

3617,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",Another way to test the beauty of `The Song of the Chattahoochee'
3618,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",is to compare it with other kindred poems.  There are many stream-songs
