588,BOOK II,In the name of these States shall I scorn the antique?
589,BOOK II,Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.
590,BOOK II,
591,BOOK II,5
592,BOOK II,"Dead poets, philosophs, priests,"
593,BOOK II,"Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,"
594,BOOK II,"Language-shapers on other shores,"

598,BOOK II,"I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it,)"
599,BOOK II,"Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more"
600,BOOK II,"than it deserves,"
601,BOOK II,"Regarding it all intently a long while, then dismissing it,"
602,BOOK II,I stand in my place with my own day here.
603,BOOK II,
604,BOOK II,"Here lands female and male,"
605,BOOK II,"Here the heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world, here the flame of"
606,BOOK II,"materials,"
607,BOOK II,"Here spirituality the translatress, the openly-avow’d,"
608,BOOK II,"The ever-tending, the finale of visible forms,"
609,BOOK II,"The satisfier, after due long-waiting now advancing,"
610,BOOK II,Yes here comes my mistress the soul.
611,BOOK II,
612,BOOK II,6
613,BOOK II,"The soul,"
614,BOOK II,Forever and forever--longer than soil is brown and solid--longer
615,BOOK II,than water ebbs and flows.
616,BOOK II,"I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the"
617,BOOK II,"most spiritual poems,"
618,BOOK II,"And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,"
619,BOOK II,For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and
620,BOOK II,of immortality.
621,BOOK II,
622,BOOK II,I will make a song for these States that no one State may under any
623,BOOK II,"circumstances be subjected to another State,"
624,BOOK II,And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by
625,BOOK II,"night between all the States, and between any two of them,"
626,BOOK II,"And I will make a song for the ears of the President, full of"
627,BOOK II,"weapons with menacing points,"
628,BOOK II,And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces;
629,BOOK II,"And a song make I of the One form’d out of all,"
630,BOOK II,"The fang’d and glittering One whose head is over all,"
631,BOOK II,"Resolute warlike One including and over all,"
632,BOOK II,(However high the head of any else that head is over all.)
633,BOOK II,
634,BOOK II,"I will acknowledge contemporary lands,"
635,BOOK II,I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute courteously
636,BOOK II,"every city large and small,"
637,BOOK II,And employments! I will put in my poems that with you is heroism
638,BOOK II,"upon land and sea,"
639,BOOK II,And I will report all heroism from an American point of view.
640,BOOK II,
641,BOOK II,"I will sing the song of companionship,"
642,BOOK II,"I will show what alone must finally compact these,"
643,BOOK II,"I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love,"
644,BOOK II,"indicating it in me,"
645,BOOK II,I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were
646,BOOK II,"threatening to consume me,"
647,BOOK II,"I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires,"
648,BOOK II,"I will give them complete abandonment,"
649,BOOK II,"I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love,"
650,BOOK II,For who but I should understand love with all its sorrow and joy?
651,BOOK II,And who but I should be the poet of comrades?
652,BOOK II,
653,BOOK II,7
654,BOOK II,"I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races,"
655,BOOK II,"I advance from the people in their own spirit,"
656,BOOK II,Here is what sings unrestricted faith.
657,BOOK II,
658,BOOK II,"Omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may,"
659,BOOK II,"I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate that part also,"
660,BOOK II,"I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is--and I say"
661,BOOK II,"there is in fact no evil,"
662,BOOK II,"(Or if there is I say it is just as important to you, to the land or"
663,BOOK II,"to me, as any thing else.)"
664,BOOK II,
665,BOOK II,"I too, following many and follow’d by many, inaugurate a religion, I"
666,BOOK II,"descend into the arena,"
667,BOOK II,"(It may be I am destin’d to utter the loudest cries there, the"
668,BOOK II,"winner’s pealing shouts,"
669,BOOK II,"Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above every thing.)"
670,BOOK II,
671,BOOK II,"Each is not for its own sake,"
672,BOOK II,I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religion’s sake.
673,BOOK II,
674,BOOK II,"I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough,"
675,BOOK II,"None has ever yet adored or worship’d half enough,"
676,BOOK II,"None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain"
677,BOOK II,the future is.
678,BOOK II,
679,BOOK II,I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be
680,BOOK II,"their religion,"
681,BOOK II,Otherwise there is just no real and permanent grandeur;
682,BOOK II,"(Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion,"
683,BOOK II,Nor land nor man or woman without religion.)
684,BOOK II,
685,BOOK II,8
686,BOOK II,What are you doing young man?
687,BOOK II,"Are you so earnest, so given up to literature, science, art, amours?"
688,BOOK II,"These ostensible realities, politics, points?"
689,BOOK II,Your ambition or business whatever it may be?
690,BOOK II,
691,BOOK II,"It is well--against such I say not a word, I am their poet also,"
692,BOOK II,"But behold! such swiftly subside, burnt up for religion’s sake,"
693,BOOK II,"For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential"
694,BOOK II,"life of the earth,"
695,BOOK II,Any more than such are to religion.
696,BOOK II,
697,BOOK II,9
698,BOOK II,What do you seek so pensive and silent?
699,BOOK II,What do you need camerado?
700,BOOK II,Dear son do you think it is love?
701,BOOK II,
702,BOOK II,"Listen dear son--listen America, daughter or son,"
703,BOOK II,"It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess, and yet it"
704,BOOK II,"satisfies, it is great,"
705,BOOK II,"But there is something else very great, it makes the whole coincide,"
706,BOOK II,"It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands sweeps and"
707,BOOK II,provides for all.
708,BOOK II,
709,BOOK II,10
710,BOOK II,"Know you, solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion,"
711,BOOK II,The following chants each for its kind I sing.
712,BOOK II,
713,BOOK II,My comrade!
714,BOOK II,"For you to share with me two greatnesses, and a third one rising"
715,BOOK II,"inclusive and more resplendent,"
716,BOOK II,"The greatness of Love and Democracy, and the greatness of Religion."
717,BOOK II,
718,BOOK II,"Melange mine own, the unseen and the seen,"
719,BOOK II,"Mysterious ocean where the streams empty,"
720,BOOK II,"Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me,"
721,BOOK II,"Living beings, identities now doubtless near us in the air that we"
722,BOOK II,"know not of,"
723,BOOK II,"Contact daily and hourly that will not release me,"
724,BOOK II,"These selecting, these in hints demanded of me."
725,BOOK II,
726,BOOK II,"Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me,"
727,BOOK II,"Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him,"
728,BOOK II,"Any more than I am held to the heavens and all the spiritual world,"
729,BOOK II,"After what they have done to me, suggesting themes."
730,BOOK II,
731,BOOK II,O such themes--equalities! O divine average!
732,BOOK II,"Warblings under the sun, usher’d as now, or at noon, or setting,"
733,BOOK II,"Strains musical flowing through ages, now reaching hither,"
734,BOOK II,"I take to your reckless and composite chords, add to them, and"
735,BOOK II,cheerfully pass them forward.
736,BOOK II,
737,BOOK II,11
738,BOOK II,"As I have walk’d in Alabama my morning walk,"
739,BOOK II,I have seen where the she-bird the mocking-bird sat on her nest in
740,BOOK II,the briers hatching her brood.
741,BOOK II,
742,BOOK II,"I have seen the he-bird also,"
743,BOOK II,I have paus’d to hear him near at hand inflating his throat and
744,BOOK II,joyfully singing.
745,BOOK II,
746,BOOK II,And while I paus’d it came to me that what he really sang for was
747,BOOK II,"not there only,"
748,BOOK II,"Nor for his mate nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes,"
749,BOOK II,"But subtle, clandestine, away beyond,"
750,BOOK II,A charge transmitted and gift occult for those being born.
751,BOOK II,
752,BOOK II,12
753,BOOK II,Democracy! near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and
754,BOOK II,joyfully singing.
755,BOOK II,
756,BOOK II,"Ma femme! for the brood beyond us and of us,"
757,BOOK II,"For those who belong here and those to come,"
758,BOOK II,I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger
759,BOOK II,and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.
760,BOOK II,
761,BOOK II,"I will make the songs of passion to give them their way,"
762,BOOK II,"And your songs outlaw’d offenders, for I scan you with kindred eyes,"
763,BOOK II,and carry you with me the same as any.
764,BOOK II,
765,BOOK II,"I will make the true poem of riches,"
766,BOOK II,To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes forward
767,BOOK II,and is not dropt by death;
768,BOOK II,"I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all, and I will be the"
769,BOOK II,"bard of personality,"
770,BOOK II,And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of
771,BOOK II,"the other,"
772,BOOK II,"And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me, for I am determin’d"
773,BOOK II,"to tell you with courageous clear voice to prove you illustrious,"
774,BOOK II,"And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present, and"
775,BOOK II,"can be none in the future,"
776,BOOK II,And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be turn’d to
777,BOOK II,"beautiful results,"
778,BOOK II,"And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death,"
779,BOOK II,And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are
780,BOOK II,"compact,"
781,BOOK II,"And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each"
782,BOOK II,as profound as any.
783,BOOK II,
784,BOOK II,"I will not make poems with reference to parts,"
785,BOOK II,"But I will make poems, songs, thoughts, with reference to ensemble,"
786,BOOK II,"And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to"
787,BOOK II,"all days,"
788,BOOK II,And I will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but has

2753,BOOK III,"Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,"
2754,BOOK III,"Crying by day, Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and"
2755,BOOK III,"chirping over my head,"
2756,BOOK III,"Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,"
2757,BOOK III,"Lighting on every moment of my life,"
2758,BOOK III,"Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,"

2784,BOOK III,
2785,BOOK III,"A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do"

2803,BOOK III,"I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,"
2804,BOOK III,"I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,"
2805,BOOK III,"But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,"
2806,BOOK III,"My left hand hooking you round the waist,"
2807,BOOK III,My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.
2808,BOOK III,
2809,BOOK III,"Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,"
2810,BOOK III,You must travel it for yourself.
2811,BOOK III,
2812,BOOK III,"It is not far, it is within reach,"

2860,BOOK III,Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over

2901,BOOK III,"I have said that the soul is not more than the body,"
2902,BOOK III,"And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,"

2904,BOOK III,And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own
2905,BOOK III,"funeral drest in his shroud,"
2906,BOOK III,"And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,"
2907,BOOK III,And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the

2919,BOOK III,
2920,BOOK III,"I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,"
2921,BOOK III,Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.

2950,BOOK III,If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?
2951,BOOK III,
2952,BOOK III,"Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,"
2953,BOOK III,"Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,"
2954,BOOK III,"Toss, sparkles of day and dusk--toss on the black stems that decay"

2967,BOOK III,
2968,BOOK III,"I do not know it--it is without name--it is a word unsaid,"
2969,BOOK III,"It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol."
2970,BOOK III,
2971,BOOK III,"Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,"
2972,BOOK III,To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.
2973,BOOK III,
2974,BOOK III,Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.
2975,BOOK III,
2976,BOOK III,Do you see O my brothers and sisters?
2977,BOOK III,"It is not chaos or death--it is form, union, plan--it is eternal"
2978,BOOK III,life--it is Happiness.
2979,BOOK III,
2980,BOOK III,51
2981,BOOK III,"The past and present wilt--I have fill’d them, emptied them."
2982,BOOK III,And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.

2984,BOOK III,Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?
2985,BOOK III,"Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,"
2986,BOOK III,"(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)"
2987,BOOK III,
2988,BOOK III,Do I contradict myself?
2989,BOOK III,"Very well then I contradict myself,"
2990,BOOK III,"(I am large, I contain multitudes.)"
2991,BOOK III,
2992,BOOK III,"I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab."
2993,BOOK III,
2994,BOOK III,Who has done his day’s work? who will soonest be through with his supper?
2995,BOOK III,Who wishes to walk with me?
2996,BOOK III,
2997,BOOK III,Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?
2998,BOOK III,
2999,BOOK III,52
3000,BOOK III,"The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab"
3001,BOOK III,and my loitering.
3002,BOOK III,
3003,BOOK III,"I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,"
3004,BOOK III,I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.
3005,BOOK III,
3006,BOOK III,"The last scud of day holds back for me,"
3007,BOOK III,"It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds,"
3008,BOOK III,It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.
3009,BOOK III,
3010,BOOK III,"I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,"

3016,BOOK III,"You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,"
3017,BOOK III,"But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,"

4055,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,
4056,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv’d
4057,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"with plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for"
4058,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"me that follow’d,"
4059,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"And else when I carous’d, or when my plans were accomplish’d, still"

4061,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health,"
4062,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"refresh’d, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,"
4063,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the

4065,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"When I wander’d alone over the beach, and undressing bathed,"
4066,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,"
4067,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way

4072,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"my friend,"
4073,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly
4074,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"continually up the shores,"
4075,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me
4076,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"whispering to congratulate me,"
4077,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in
4078,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"the cool night,"
4079,BOOK V.  CALAMUS,"In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me,"

6769,BOOK XIV,"A murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,"
6770,BOOK XIV,Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense.
6771,BOOK XIV,
6772,BOOK XIV,"Farewell my brethren,"
6773,BOOK XIV,"Farewell O earth and sky, farewell ye neighboring waters,"
6774,BOOK XIV,"My time has ended, my term has come."

6788,BOOK XIV,"join the refrain,"
6789,BOOK XIV,But in my soul I plainly heard.
6790,BOOK XIV,
6791,BOOK XIV,"Murmuring out of its myriad leaves,"
6792,BOOK XIV,"Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high,"
6793,BOOK XIV,"Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs, out of its foot-thick bark,"

9719,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,
9720,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,"I tell not now the whole of the battle,"
9721,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,But one brigade early in the forenoon order’d forward to engage the

9723,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,"Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march’d,"

9725,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,
9726,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death?
9727,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,"It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,"

9741,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,
9742,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,"It sickens me yet, that slaughter!"
9743,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.
9744,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.
9745,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,
9746,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,"Meanwhile the British manœuvr’d to draw us out for a pitch’d battle,"
9747,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch’d battle.
9748,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,
9749,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,"We fought the fight in detachments,"

9775,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,

9782,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS,"Every one else seem’d fill’d with gloom,"

12154,BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS,"The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence,"
12155,BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS,Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that
12156,BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS,suits immortality.
12157,BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS,
12158,BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS,"The soul is of itself,"

12166,BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS,"The indirect is just as much as the direct,"

12220,BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS,
12221,BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS,Whatever satisfies souls is true;

12223,BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS,"Itself only finally satisfies the soul,"
12224,BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS,The soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson
