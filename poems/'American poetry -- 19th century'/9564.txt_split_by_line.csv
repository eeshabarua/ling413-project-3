42,AMONG THE HILLS,"This poem, when originally published, was dedicated to Annie Fields,"
43,AMONG THE HILLS,"wife of the distinguished publisher, James T. Fields, of Boston, in"
44,AMONG THE HILLS,grateful acknowledgment of the strength and inspiration I have found in
45,AMONG THE HILLS,her friendship and sympathy. The poem in its first form was entitled The
46,AMONG THE HILLS,"Wife: an Idyl of Bearcamp Water, and appeared in The Atlantic Monthly"
47,AMONG THE HILLS,"for January, 1868. When I published the volume Among the Hills, in"
48,AMONG THE HILLS,"December of the same year, I expanded the Prelude and filled out also"
49,AMONG THE HILLS,the outlines of the story.

52,PRELUDE.,PRELUDE.
53,PRELUDE.,
54,PRELUDE.,"ALONG the roadside, like the flowers of gold"
55,PRELUDE.,"That tawny Incas for their gardens wrought,"
56,PRELUDE.,"Heavy with sunshine droops the golden-rod,"
57,PRELUDE.,And the red pennons of the cardinal-flowers
58,PRELUDE.,Hang motionless upon their upright staves.
59,PRELUDE.,"The sky is hot and hazy, and the wind,"
60,PRELUDE.,"Vying-weary with its long flight from the south,"
61,PRELUDE.,"Unfelt; yet, closely scanned, yon maple leaf"
62,PRELUDE.,"With faintest motion, as one stirs in dreams,"
63,PRELUDE.,Confesses it. The locust by the wall
64,PRELUDE.,Stabs the noon-silence with his sharp alarm.
65,PRELUDE.,A single hay-cart down the dusty road
66,PRELUDE.,"Creaks slowly, with its driver fast asleep"
67,PRELUDE.,"On the load's top. Against the neighboring hill,"
68,PRELUDE.,"Huddled along the stone wall's shady side,"
69,PRELUDE.,"The sheep show white, as if a snowdrift still"
70,PRELUDE.,Defied the dog-star. Through the open door
71,PRELUDE.,"A drowsy smell of flowers-gray heliotrope,"
72,PRELUDE.,"And white sweet clover, and shy mignonette--"
73,PRELUDE.,"Comes faintly in, and silent chorus lends"
74,PRELUDE.,To the pervading symphony of peace.
75,PRELUDE.,No time is this for hands long over-worn
76,PRELUDE.,To task their strength; and (unto Him be praise
77,PRELUDE.,Who giveth quietness!) the stress and strain
78,PRELUDE.,Of years that did the work of centuries
79,PRELUDE.,"Have ceased, and we can draw our breath once more"
80,PRELUDE.,"Freely and full. So, as yon harvesters"
81,PRELUDE.,Make glad their nooning underneath the elms
82,PRELUDE.,"With tale and riddle and old snatch of song,"
83,PRELUDE.,"I lay aside grave themes, and idly turn"
84,PRELUDE.,"The leaves of memory's sketch-book, dreaming o'er"
85,PRELUDE.,"Old summer pictures of the quiet hills,"
86,PRELUDE.,"And human life, as quiet, at their feet."
87,PRELUDE.,
88,PRELUDE.,"And yet not idly all. A farmer's son,"
89,PRELUDE.,"Proud of field-lore and harvest craft, and feeling"
90,PRELUDE.,"All their fine possibilities, how rich"
91,PRELUDE.,And restful even poverty and toil
92,PRELUDE.,"Become when beauty, harmony, and love"
93,PRELUDE.,Sit at their humble hearth as angels sat
94,PRELUDE.,"At evening in the patriarch's tent, when man"
95,PRELUDE.,"Makes labor noble, and his farmer's frock"
96,PRELUDE.,The symbol of a Christian chivalry
97,PRELUDE.,Tender and just and generous to her
98,PRELUDE.,"Who clothes with grace all duty; still, I know"
99,PRELUDE.,"Too well the picture has another side,--"
100,PRELUDE.,How wearily the grind of toil goes on
101,PRELUDE.,"Where love is wanting, how the eye and ear"
102,PRELUDE.,And heart are starved amidst the plenitude
103,PRELUDE.,"Of nature, and how hard and colorless"
104,PRELUDE.,Is life without an atmosphere. I look
105,PRELUDE.,"Across the lapse of half a century,"
106,PRELUDE.,"And call to mind old homesteads, where no flower"
107,PRELUDE.,"Told that the spring had come, but evil weeds,"
108,PRELUDE.,Nightshade and rough-leaved burdock in the place
109,PRELUDE.,Of the sweet doorway greeting of the rose
110,PRELUDE.,"And honeysuckle, where the house walls seemed"
111,PRELUDE.,"Blistering in sun, without a tree or vine"
112,PRELUDE.,To cast the tremulous shadow of its leaves
113,PRELUDE.,"Across the curtainless windows, from whose panes"
114,PRELUDE.,Fluttered the signal rags of shiftlessness.
115,PRELUDE.,"Within, the cluttered kitchen-floor, unwashed"
116,PRELUDE.,(Broom-clean I think they called it); the best room
117,PRELUDE.,"Stifling with cellar damp, shut from the air"
118,PRELUDE.,"In hot midsummer, bookless, pictureless,"
119,PRELUDE.,Save the inevitable sampler hung
120,PRELUDE.,"Over the fireplace, or a mourning piece,"
121,PRELUDE.,"A green-haired woman, peony-cheeked, beneath"
122,PRELUDE.,Impossible willows; the wide-throated hearth
123,PRELUDE.,Bristling with faded pine-boughs half concealing
124,PRELUDE.,The piled-up rubbish at the chimney's back;
125,PRELUDE.,"And, in sad keeping with all things about them,"
126,PRELUDE.,"Shrill, querulous-women, sour and sullen men,"
127,PRELUDE.,"Untidy, loveless, old before their time,"
128,PRELUDE.,With scarce a human interest save their own
129,PRELUDE.,"Monotonous round of small economies,"
130,PRELUDE.,Or the poor scandal of the neighborhood;
131,PRELUDE.,"Blind to the beauty everywhere revealed,"
132,PRELUDE.,Treading the May-flowers with regardless feet;
133,PRELUDE.,For them the song-sparrow and the bobolink
134,PRELUDE.,"Sang not, nor winds made music in the leaves;"
135,PRELUDE.,For them in vain October's holocaust
136,PRELUDE.,"Burned, gold and crimson, over all the hills,"
137,PRELUDE.,The sacramental mystery of the woods.
138,PRELUDE.,"Church-goers, fearful of the unseen Powers,"
139,PRELUDE.,"But grumbling over pulpit-tax and pew-rent,"
140,PRELUDE.,"Saving, as shrewd economists, their souls"
141,PRELUDE.,And winter pork with the least possible outlay
142,PRELUDE.,Of salt and sanctity; in daily life
143,PRELUDE.,Showing as little actual comprehension
144,PRELUDE.,"Of Christian charity and love and duty,"
145,PRELUDE.,As if the Sermon on the Mount had been
146,PRELUDE.,Outdated like a last year's almanac
147,PRELUDE.,"Rich in broad woodlands and in half-tilled fields,"
148,PRELUDE.,"And yet so pinched and bare and comfortless,"
149,PRELUDE.,"The veriest straggler limping on his rounds,"
150,PRELUDE.,"The sun and air his sole inheritance,"
151,PRELUDE.,"Laughed at a poverty that paid its taxes,"
152,PRELUDE.,And hugged his rags in self-complacency!
153,PRELUDE.,
154,PRELUDE.,Not such should be the homesteads of a land
155,PRELUDE.,Where whoso wisely wills and acts may dwell
156,PRELUDE.,"As king and lawgiver, in broad-acred state,"
157,PRELUDE.,"With beauty, art, taste, culture, books, to make"
158,PRELUDE.,His hour of leisure richer than a life
159,PRELUDE.,"Of fourscore to the barons of old time,"
160,PRELUDE.,Our yeoman should be equal to his home
161,PRELUDE.,"Set in the fair, green valleys, purple walled,"
162,PRELUDE.,"A man to match his mountains, not to creep"
163,PRELUDE.,Dwarfed and abased below them. I would fain
164,PRELUDE.,In this light way (of which I needs must own
165,PRELUDE.,"With the knife-grinder of whom Canning sings,"
166,PRELUDE.,"""Story, God bless you! I have none to tell you!"")"
167,PRELUDE.,Invite the eye to see and heart to feel
168,PRELUDE.,"The beauty and the joy within their reach,--"
169,PRELUDE.,"Home, and home loves, and the beatitudes"
170,PRELUDE.,Of nature free to all. Haply in years
171,PRELUDE.,"That wait to take the places of our own,"
172,PRELUDE.,Heard where some breezy balcony looks down
173,PRELUDE.,"On happy homes, or where the lake in the moon"
174,PRELUDE.,"Sleeps dreaming of the mountains, fair as Ruth,"
175,PRELUDE.,"In the old Hebrew pastoral, at the feet"
176,PRELUDE.,"Of Boaz, even this simple lay of mine"
177,PRELUDE.,"May seem the burden of a prophecy,"
178,PRELUDE.,Finding its late fulfilment in a change
179,PRELUDE.,"Slow as the oak's growth, lifting manhood up"
180,PRELUDE.,"Through broader culture, finer manners, love,"
181,PRELUDE.,"And reverence, to the level of the hills."
182,PRELUDE.,
183,PRELUDE.,"O Golden Age, whose light is of the dawn,"
184,PRELUDE.,"And not of sunset, forward, not behind,"
185,PRELUDE.,"Flood the new heavens and earth, and with thee bring"
186,PRELUDE.,"All the old virtues, whatsoever things"
187,PRELUDE.,"Are pure and honest and of good repute,"
188,PRELUDE.,But add thereto whatever bard has sung
189,PRELUDE.,Or seer has told of when in trance and dream
190,PRELUDE.,They saw the Happy Isles of prophecy
191,PRELUDE.,"Let Justice hold her scale, and Truth divide"
192,PRELUDE.,Between the right and wrong; but give the heart
193,PRELUDE.,The freedom of its fair inheritance;
194,PRELUDE.,"Let the poor prisoner, cramped and starved so long,"
195,PRELUDE.,At Nature's table feast his ear and eye
196,PRELUDE.,With joy and wonder; let all harmonies
197,PRELUDE.,"Of sound, form, color, motion, wait upon"
198,PRELUDE.,"The princely guest, whether in soft attire"
199,PRELUDE.,"Of leisure clad, or the coarse frock of toil,"
200,PRELUDE.,"And, lending life to the dead form of faith,"
201,PRELUDE.,Give human nature reverence for the sake
202,PRELUDE.,"Of One who bore it, making it divine"
203,PRELUDE.,With the ineffable tenderness of God;
204,PRELUDE.,"Let common need, the brotherhood of prayer,"
205,PRELUDE.,"The heirship of an unknown destiny,"
206,PRELUDE.,"The unsolved mystery round about us, make"
207,PRELUDE.,A man more precious than the gold of Ophir.
208,PRELUDE.,"Sacred, inviolate, unto whom all things"
209,PRELUDE.,"Should minister, as outward types and signs"
210,PRELUDE.,Of the eternal beauty which fulfils
211,PRELUDE.,"The one great purpose of creation, Love,"
212,PRELUDE.,The sole necessity of Earth and Heaven!
213,PRELUDE.,
214,PRELUDE.,. . . . . . . . . . .
215,PRELUDE.,
216,PRELUDE.,For weeks the clouds had raked the hills
217,PRELUDE.,"And vexed the vales with raining,"
218,PRELUDE.,"And all the woods were sad with mist,"
219,PRELUDE.,And all the brooks complaining.
220,PRELUDE.,
221,PRELUDE.,"At last, a sudden night-storm tore"
222,PRELUDE.,"The mountain veils asunder,"
223,PRELUDE.,And swept the valleys clean before
224,PRELUDE.,The besom of the thunder.
225,PRELUDE.,
226,PRELUDE.,Through Sandwich notch the west-wind sang
227,PRELUDE.,Good morrow to the cotter;
228,PRELUDE.,And once again Chocorua's horn
229,PRELUDE.,Of shadow pierced the water.
230,PRELUDE.,
231,PRELUDE.,"Above his broad lake Ossipee,"
232,PRELUDE.,"Once more the sunshine wearing,"
233,PRELUDE.,"Stooped, tracing on that silver shield"
234,PRELUDE.,His grim armorial bearing.
235,PRELUDE.,
236,PRELUDE.,"Clear drawn against the hard blue sky,"
237,PRELUDE.,The peaks had winter's keenness;
238,PRELUDE.,"And, close on autumn's frost, the vales"
239,PRELUDE.,Had more than June's fresh greenness.
240,PRELUDE.,
241,PRELUDE.,Again the sodden forest floors
242,PRELUDE.,"With golden lights were checkered,"
243,PRELUDE.,Once more rejoicing leaves in wind
244,PRELUDE.,And sunshine danced and flickered.
245,PRELUDE.,
246,PRELUDE.,It was as if the summer's late
247,PRELUDE.,Atoning for it's sadness
248,PRELUDE.,Had borrowed every season's charm
249,PRELUDE.,To end its days in gladness.
250,PRELUDE.,
251,PRELUDE.,Rivers of gold-mist flowing down
252,PRELUDE.,"From far celestial fountains,--"
253,PRELUDE.,The great sun flaming through the rifts
254,PRELUDE.,Beyond the wall of mountains.
255,PRELUDE.,
256,PRELUDE.,We paused at last where home-bound cows
257,PRELUDE.,"Brought down the pasture's treasure,"
258,PRELUDE.,And in the barn the rhythmic flails
259,PRELUDE.,Beat out a harvest measure.
260,PRELUDE.,
261,PRELUDE.,"We heard the night-hawk's sullen plunge,"
262,PRELUDE.,The crow his tree-mates calling
263,PRELUDE.,The shadows lengthening down the slopes
264,PRELUDE.,About our feet were falling.
265,PRELUDE.,
266,PRELUDE.,And through them smote the level sun
267,PRELUDE.,"In broken lines of splendor,"
268,PRELUDE.,Touched the gray rocks and made the green
269,PRELUDE.,Of the shorn grass more tender.
270,PRELUDE.,
271,PRELUDE.,"The maples bending o'er the gate,"
272,PRELUDE.,Their arch of leaves just tinted
273,PRELUDE.,"With yellow warmth, the golden glow"
274,PRELUDE.,Of coming autumn hinted.
275,PRELUDE.,
276,PRELUDE.,"Keen white between the farm-house showed,"
277,PRELUDE.,"And smiled on porch and trellis,"
278,PRELUDE.,The fair democracy of flowers
279,PRELUDE.,That equals cot and palace.
280,PRELUDE.,
281,PRELUDE.,"And weaving garlands for her dog,"
282,PRELUDE.,"'Twixt chidings and caresses,"
283,PRELUDE.,A human flower of childhood shook
284,PRELUDE.,The sunshine from her tresses.
285,PRELUDE.,
286,PRELUDE.,"Clear drawn against the hard blue sky,"
287,PRELUDE.,The peaks had winter's keenness;
288,PRELUDE.,"And, close on autumn's frost, the vales"
289,PRELUDE.,Had more than June's fresh greenness.
290,PRELUDE.,
291,PRELUDE.,Again the sodden forest floors
292,PRELUDE.,"With golden lights were checkered,"
293,PRELUDE.,Once more rejoicing leaves in wind
294,PRELUDE.,And sunshine danced and flickered.
295,PRELUDE.,
296,PRELUDE.,It was as if the summer's late
297,PRELUDE.,Atoning for it's sadness
298,PRELUDE.,Had borrowed every season's charm
299,PRELUDE.,To end its days in gladness.
300,PRELUDE.,
301,PRELUDE.,I call to mind those banded vales
302,PRELUDE.,"Of shadow and of shining,"
303,PRELUDE.,"Through which, my hostess at my side,"
304,PRELUDE.,I drove in day's declining.
305,PRELUDE.,
306,PRELUDE.,We held our sideling way above
307,PRELUDE.,"The river's whitening shallows,"
308,PRELUDE.,"By homesteads old, with wide-flung barns"
309,PRELUDE.,Swept through and through by swallows;
310,PRELUDE.,
311,PRELUDE.,"By maple orchards, belts of pine"
312,PRELUDE.,And larches climbing darkly
313,PRELUDE.,"The mountain slopes, and, over all,"
314,PRELUDE.,The great peaks rising starkly.
315,PRELUDE.,
316,PRELUDE.,You should have seen that long hill-range
317,PRELUDE.,"With gaps of brightness riven,--"
318,PRELUDE.,How through each pass and hollow streamed
319,PRELUDE.,"The purpling lights of heaven,--"
320,PRELUDE.,
321,PRELUDE.,On either hand we saw the signs
322,PRELUDE.,"Of fancy and of shrewdness,"
323,PRELUDE.,Where taste had wound its arms of vines
324,PRELUDE.,Round thrift's uncomely rudeness.
325,PRELUDE.,
326,PRELUDE.,The sun-brown farmer in his frock
327,PRELUDE.,"Shook hands, and called to Mary"
328,PRELUDE.,"Bare-armed, as Juno might, she came,"
329,PRELUDE.,White-aproned from her dairy.
330,PRELUDE.,
331,PRELUDE.,"Her air, her smile, her motions, told"
332,PRELUDE.,Of womanly completeness;
333,PRELUDE.,A music as of household songs
334,PRELUDE.,Was in her voice of sweetness.
335,PRELUDE.,
336,PRELUDE.,"Not fair alone in curve and line,"
337,PRELUDE.,"But something more and better,"
338,PRELUDE.,"The secret charm eluding art,"
339,PRELUDE.,"Its spirit, not its letter;--"
340,PRELUDE.,
341,PRELUDE.,An inborn grace that nothing lacked
342,PRELUDE.,"Of culture or appliance,"
343,PRELUDE.,"The warmth of genial courtesy,"
344,PRELUDE.,The calm of self-reliance.
345,PRELUDE.,
346,PRELUDE.,Before her queenly womanhood
347,PRELUDE.,How dared our hostess utter
348,PRELUDE.,The paltry errand of her need
349,PRELUDE.,To buy her fresh-churned butter?
350,PRELUDE.,
351,PRELUDE.,"She led the way with housewife pride,"
352,PRELUDE.,"Her goodly store disclosing,"
353,PRELUDE.,Full tenderly the golden balls
354,PRELUDE.,With practised hands disposing.
355,PRELUDE.,
356,PRELUDE.,"Then, while along the western hills"
357,PRELUDE.,We watched the changeful glory
358,PRELUDE.,"Of sunset, on our homeward way,"
359,PRELUDE.,I heard her simple story.
360,PRELUDE.,
361,PRELUDE.,The early crickets sang; the stream
362,PRELUDE.,Plashed through my friend's narration
363,PRELUDE.,Her rustic patois of the hills
364,PRELUDE.,Lost in my free-translation.
365,PRELUDE.,
366,PRELUDE.,"""More wise,"" she said, ""than those who swarm"
367,PRELUDE.,"Our hills in middle summer,"
368,PRELUDE.,"She came, when June's first roses blow,"
369,PRELUDE.,To greet the early comer.
370,PRELUDE.,
371,PRELUDE.,"""From school and ball and rout she came,"
372,PRELUDE.,"The city's fair, pale daughter,"
373,PRELUDE.,To drink the wine of mountain air
374,PRELUDE.,Beside the Bearcamp Water.
375,PRELUDE.,
376,PRELUDE.,"""Her step grew firmer on the hills"
377,PRELUDE.,That watch our homesteads over;
378,PRELUDE.,"On cheek and lip, from summer fields,"
379,PRELUDE.,She caught the bloom of clover.
380,PRELUDE.,
381,PRELUDE.,"""For health comes sparkling in the streams"
382,PRELUDE.,From cool Chocorua stealing
383,PRELUDE.,There's iron in our Northern winds;
384,PRELUDE.,Our pines are trees of healing.
385,PRELUDE.,
386,PRELUDE.,"""She sat beneath the broad-armed elms"
387,PRELUDE.,"That skirt the mowing-meadow,"
388,PRELUDE.,And watched the gentle west-wind weave
389,PRELUDE.,The grass with shine and shadow.
390,PRELUDE.,
391,PRELUDE.,"""Beside her, from the summer heat"
392,PRELUDE.,"To share her grateful screening,"
393,PRELUDE.,"With forehead bared, the farmer stood,"
394,PRELUDE.,Upon his pitchfork leaning.
395,PRELUDE.,
396,PRELUDE.,"""Framed in its damp, dark locks, his face"
397,PRELUDE.,"Had nothing mean or common,--"
398,PRELUDE.,"Strong, manly, true, the tenderness"
399,PRELUDE.,And pride beloved of woman.
400,PRELUDE.,
401,PRELUDE.,"""She looked up, glowing with the health"
402,PRELUDE.,"The country air had brought her,"
403,PRELUDE.,"And, laughing, said: 'You lack a wife,"
404,PRELUDE.,Your mother lacks a daughter.
405,PRELUDE.,
406,PRELUDE.,"""'To mend your frock and bake your bread"
407,PRELUDE.,You do not need a lady
408,PRELUDE.,Be sure among these brown old homes
409,PRELUDE.,"Is some one waiting ready,--"
410,PRELUDE.,
411,PRELUDE.,"""'Some fair, sweet girl with skilful hand"
412,PRELUDE.,"And cheerful heart for treasure,"
413,PRELUDE.,"Who never played with ivory keys,"
414,PRELUDE.,Or danced the polka's measure.'
415,PRELUDE.,
416,PRELUDE.,"""He bent his black brows to a frown,"
417,PRELUDE.,He set his white teeth tightly.
418,PRELUDE.,"''T is well,' he said, 'for one like you"
419,PRELUDE.,To choose for me so lightly.
420,PRELUDE.,
421,PRELUDE.,"""You think, because my life is rude"
422,PRELUDE.,I take no note of sweetness
423,PRELUDE.,I tell you love has naught to do
424,PRELUDE.,With meetness or unmeetness.
425,PRELUDE.,
426,PRELUDE.,"""'Itself its best excuse, it asks"
427,PRELUDE.,No leave of pride or fashion
428,PRELUDE.,When silken zone or homespun frock
429,PRELUDE.,It stirs with throbs of passion.
430,PRELUDE.,
431,PRELUDE.,"""'You think me deaf and blind: you bring"
432,PRELUDE.,Your winning graces hither
433,PRELUDE.,As free as if from cradle-time
434,PRELUDE.,We two had played together.
435,PRELUDE.,
436,PRELUDE.,"""'You tempt me with your laughing eyes,"
437,PRELUDE.,"Your cheek of sundown's blushes,"
438,PRELUDE.,"A motion as of waving grain,"
439,PRELUDE.,A music as of thrushes.
440,PRELUDE.,
441,PRELUDE.,"""'The plaything of your summer sport,"
442,PRELUDE.,The spells you weave around me
443,PRELUDE.,"You cannot at your will undo,"
444,PRELUDE.,Nor leave me as you found me.
445,PRELUDE.,
446,PRELUDE.,"""'You go as lightly as you came,"
447,PRELUDE.,Your life is well without me;
448,PRELUDE.,What care you that these hills will close
449,PRELUDE.,Like prison-walls about me?
450,PRELUDE.,
451,PRELUDE.,"""'No mood is mine to seek a wife,"
452,PRELUDE.,Or daughter for my mother
453,PRELUDE.,Who loves you loses in that love
454,PRELUDE.,All power to love another!
