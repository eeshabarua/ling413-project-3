3804,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,was encouraged in this project by my friend the late
3805,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Arthur Hugh Clough.]

3807,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
3808,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,The next whose fortune ’twas a tale to tell
3809,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Was one whom men, before they thought, loved well,"
3810,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And after thinking wondered why they did,"
3811,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"For half he seemed to let them, half forbid,"
3812,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And wrapped him so in humors, sheath on sheath,"
3813,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,’T was hard to guess the mellow soul beneath;
3814,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"But, once divined, you took him to your heart,"
3815,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,While he appeared to bear with you as part
3816,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Of life’s impertinence, and once a year"
3817,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Betrayed his true self by a smile or tear,"
3818,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Or rather something sweetly-shy and loath,"
3819,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Withdrawn ere fully shown, and mixed of both."
3820,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,A cynic? Not precisely: one who thrust
3821,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Against a heart too prone to love and trust,"
3822,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Who so despised false sentiment he knew
3823,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Scarce in himself to part the false and true,"
3824,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And strove to hide, by roughening-o’er the skin,"
3825,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Those cobweb nerves he could not dull within.
3826,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Gentle by birth, but of a stem decayed,"
3827,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,He shunned life’s rivalries and hated trade;
3828,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"On a small patrimony and larger pride,"
3829,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,He lived uneaseful on the Other Side
3830,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"(So he called Europe), only coming West"
3831,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,To give his Old-World appetite new zest;
3832,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Yet still the New World spooked it in his veins,"
3833,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,A ghost he could not lay with all his pains;
3834,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,For never Pilgrims' offshoot scapes control
3835,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Of those old instincts that have shaped his soul.
3836,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A radical in thought, he puffed away"
3837,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"With shrewd contempt the dust of usage gray,"
3838,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Yet loathed democracy as one who saw,"
3839,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"In what he longed to love, some vulgar flaw,"
3840,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And, shocked through all his delicate reserves,"
3841,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Remained a Tory by his taste and nerves.
3842,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"His fancy’s thrall, he drew all ergoes thence,"
3843,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And thought himself the type of common sense;
3844,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Misliking women, not from cross or whim,"
3845,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"But that his mother shared too much in him,"
3846,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And he half felt that what in them was grace
3847,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Made the unlucky weakness of his race.
3848,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"What powers he had he hardly cared to know,"
3849,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,But sauntered through the world as through a show;
3850,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A critic fine in his haphazard way,"
3851,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,A sort of mild La Bruyère on half-pay.
3852,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,For comic weaknesses he had an eye
3853,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Keen as an acid for an alkali,"
3854,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Yet you could feel, through his sardonic tone,"
3855,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He loved them all, unless they were his own."
3856,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"You might have called him, with his humorous twist,"
3857,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,A kind of human entomologist:
3858,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"As these bring home, from every walk they take,"
3859,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Their hat-crowns stuck with bugs of curious make,"
3860,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,So he filled all the lining of his head
3861,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"With characters impaled and ticketed,"
3862,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And had a cabinet behind his eyes
3863,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,For all they caught of mortal oddities.
3864,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,He might have been a poet--many worse--
3865,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"But that he had, or feigned, contempt of verse;"
3866,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Called it tattooing language, and held rhymes"
3867,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,The young world’s lullaby of ruder times.
3868,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Bitter in words, too indolent for gall,"
3869,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He satirized himself the first of all,"
3870,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"In men and their affairs could find no law,"
3871,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And was the ill logic that he thought he saw.
3872,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
3873,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Scratching a match to light his pipe anew,"
3874,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"With eyes half shut some musing whiffs he drew,"
3875,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And thus began: “I give you all my word,"
3876,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,I think this mock-Decameron absurd;
3877,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Boccaccio’s garden! how bring that to pass
3878,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,In our bleak clime save under double glass?
3879,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,The moral east-wind of New England life
3880,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Would snip its gay luxuriance like a knife;
3881,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Mile-deep the glaciers brooded here, they say,"
3882,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Through æons numb; we feel their chill to-day.
3883,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"These foreign plants are but half-hardy still,"
3884,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Die on a south, and on a north wall chill."
3885,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Had we stayed Puritans! _They_ had some heat,"
3886,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"(Though whence derived I have my own conceit,)"
3887,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,But you have long ago raked up their fires;
3888,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Where they had faith, you’ve ten sham-Gothic spires."
3889,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Why more exotics? Try your native vines,"
3890,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And in some thousand years you _may_ have wines;
3891,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Your present grapes are harsh, all pulps and skins,"
3892,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And want traditions of ancestral bins
3893,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,That saved for evenings round the polished board
3894,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Old lava-fires, the sun-steeped hillside’s hoard."
3895,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Without a Past, you lack that southern wall"
3896,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,O’er which the vines of Poesy should crawl;
3897,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Still they’re your only hope; no midnight oil
3898,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Makes up for virtue wanting in the soil;

3901,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,You have one story-teller worth a score
3902,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Of dead Boccaccios,--nay, add twenty more,--"
3903,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A hawthorn asking spring’s most dainty breath,"
3904,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And him you’re freezing pretty well to death.
3905,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"However, since you say so, I will tease"
3906,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"My memory to a story by degrees,"
3907,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Though you will cry, 'Enough!' I’m wellnigh sure,"

3909,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Stories were good for men who had no books,"

3913,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,With here and there a fancy fit to see
3914,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Wrought to quaint grace in golden filigree,--"
3915,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Some ring that with the Muse’s finger yet
3916,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Is warm, like Aucassin and Nicolete;"

3918,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"(For better or for worse, I leave unsaid,)"

3922,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,“All tourists know Shebagog County: there

3926,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Encore the sunrise (if they’re out of bed),"
3927,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And pat the Mighty Mother on the head:
3928,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"These have I seen,--all things are good to see,--"
3929,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And wondered much at their complacency.
3930,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"This world’s great show, that took in getting-up"
3931,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Millions of years, they finish ere they sup;"
3932,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Sights that God gleams through with soul-tingling force
3933,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"They glance approvingly as things of course,"

3938,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,I often wonder what the Mountain thinks
3939,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Of French boots creaking o’er his breathless brinks,"
3940,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Or how the Sun would scare the chattering crowd,"
3941,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,If some fine day he chanced to think aloud.
3942,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"I, who love Nature much as sinners can,"
3943,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Love her where she most grandeur shows,--in man:"
3944,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Here find I mountain, forest, cloud, and sun,"

3948,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"The natural instincts year by year retire,"

3961,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Cheeshogquesumscot erst, now Jethro hight,"
3962,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Red-man and pale-face bore it equal spite.
3963,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"The railway ruined it, the natives say,"
3964,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"That passed unwisely fifteen miles away,"
3965,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And made a drain to which, with steady ooze,"
3966,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Filtered away law, stage-coach, trade, and news."
3967,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,The railway saved it; so at least think those
3968,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Who love old ways, old houses, old repose."
3969,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Of course the Tavern stayed: its genial host
3970,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Thought not of flitting more than did the post

3994,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Refusing friendship with the upstart roof.
3995,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Not so the Eagle; on a grass-green swell
3996,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,That toward the south with sweet concessions fell
3997,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"It dwelt retired, and half had grown to be"
3998,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,As aboriginal as rock or tree.
3999,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"It nestled close to earth, and seemed to brood"
4000,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"O’er homely thoughts in a half-conscious mood,"
4001,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,As by the peat that rather fades than burns

4009,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"The ample roof sloped backward to the ground,"

4011,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Patched on, as sire or son had felt the need,"
4012,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Like chance growths sprouting from the old roof’s seed,"

4014,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Its rough-barked darlings in a filial ring.
4015,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,But the great chimney was the central thought
4016,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Whose gravitation through the cluster wrought;
4017,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"For ’tis not styles far-fetched from Greece or Rome,"
4018,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"But just the Fireside, that can make a home;"
4019,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"None of your spindling things of modern style,"
4020,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Like pins stuck through to stay the card-built pile,"
4021,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"It rose broad-shouldered, kindly, debonair,"
4022,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Its warm breath whitening in the October air,"
4023,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,While on its front a heart in outline showed
4024,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,The place it filled in that serene abode.
4025,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4026,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"“When first I chanced the Eagle to explore,"
4027,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Ezra sat listless by the open door;
4028,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"One chair careened him at an angle meet,"
4029,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Another nursed his hugely-slippered feet;
4030,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Upon a third reposed a shirt-sleeved arm,"
4031,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And the whole man diffused tobacco’s charm.
4032,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"'Are you the landlord?' 'Wahl, I guess I be,'"
4033,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Watching the smoke, he answered leisurely."
4034,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He was a stoutish man, and through the breast"
4035,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Of his loose shirt there showed a brambly chest;
4036,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Streaked redly as a wind-foreboding morn,"
4037,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,His tanned cheeks curved to temples closely shorn;
4038,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Clean-shaved he was, save where a hedge of gray"
4039,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Upon his brawny throat leaned every way
4040,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"About an Adam’s-apple, that beneath"
4041,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Bulged like a boulder from a brambly heath.
4042,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"The Western World’s true child and nursling he,"
4043,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Equipt with aptitudes enough for three:
4044,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"No eye like his to value horse or cow,"
4045,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Or gauge the contents of a stack or mow;
4046,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He could foretell the weather at a word,"
4047,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He knew the haunt of every beast and bird,"
4048,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Or where a two-pound trout was sure to lie,"
4049,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Waiting the flutter of his home-made fly;
4050,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Nay, once in autumns five, he had the luck"
4051,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,To drop at fair-play range a ten-tined buck;
4052,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Of sportsmen true he favored every whim,"
4053,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,But never cockney found a guide in him;
4054,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A natural man, with all his instincts fresh,"
4055,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Not buzzing helpless in Reflection’s mesh,"
4056,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Firm on its feet stood his broad-shouldered mind,"
4057,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,As bluffly honest as a northwest wind;
4058,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Hard-headed and soft-hearted, you’d scarce meet"
4059,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,A kindlier mixture of the shrewd and sweet;
4060,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Generous by birth, and ill at saying 'No,'"
4061,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Yet in a bargain he was all men’s foe,"
4062,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Would yield no inch of vantage in a trade,"
4063,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And give away ere nightfall all he made.
4064,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4065,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,“'Can I have lodging here?' once more I said.
4066,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He blew a whiff, and, leaning back his head,"
4067,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"'You come a piece through Bailey’s woods, I s’pose,"
4068,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Acrost a bridge where a big swamp-oak grows?
4069,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"It don’t grow, neither; it’s ben dead ten year,"
4070,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Nor th' ain’t a livin' creetur, fur nor near,"

4073,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"You did n' chance to run ag’inst my son,"
4074,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A long, slab-sided youngster with a gun?"
4075,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He’d oughto ben back more ’n an hour ago,"
4076,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,An' brought some birds to dress for supper--sho!
4077,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"There he comes now. 'Say, Obed, wut ye got?"
4078,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,(He’ll hev some upland plover like as not.)
4079,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Wal, them’s real nice uns, an’ll eat A 1,"
4080,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Ef I can stop their bein' over-done;
4081,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Nothin' riles _me_ (I pledge my fastin' word)
4082,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Like cookin' out the natur' of a bird;
4083,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"(Obed, you pick ’em out o' sight an' sound,"
4084,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Your ma’am don’t love no feathers cluttrin' round;)
4085,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Jes' scare ’em with the coals,--thet’s _my_ idee.'"
4086,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Then, turning suddenly about on me,"
4087,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"'Wal, Square, I guess so. Callilate to stay?"
4088,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,I’ll ask Mis' Weeks; ’bout _thet_ it’s hern to say.'
4089,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4090,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"“Well, there I lingered all October through,"
4091,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"In that sweet atmosphere of hazy blue,"
4092,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"So leisurely, so soothing, so forgiving,"
4093,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,That sometimes makes New England fit for living.
4094,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"I watched the landscape, erst so granite glum,"
4095,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Bloom like the south side of a ripening plum,"
4096,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And each rock-maple on the hillside make
4097,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,His ten days' sunset doubled in the lake;
4098,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,The very stone walls draggling up the hills
4099,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Seemed touched, and wavered in their roundhead wills."
4100,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Ah! there’s a deal of sugar in the sun!
4101,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Tap me in Indian summer, I should run"
4102,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A juice to make rock-candy of,--but then"
4103,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,We get such weather scarce one year in ten.
4104,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4105,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"“There was a parlor in the house, a room"
4106,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,To make you shudder with its prudish gloom.
4107,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"The furniture stood round with such an air,"
4108,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"There seemed an old maid’s ghost in every chair,"
4109,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Which looked as it had scuttled to its place
4110,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And pulled extempore a Sunday face,"
4111,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Too smugly proper for a world of sin,"
4112,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Like boys on whom the minister comes in.
4113,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"The table, fronting you with icy stare,"
4114,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Strove to look witless that its legs were bare,"
4115,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,While the black sofa with its horse-hair pall
4116,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Gloomed like a bier for Comfort’s funeral.
4117,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Each piece appeared to do its chilly best
4118,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"To seem an utter stranger to the rest,"
4119,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"As if acquaintanceship were deadly sin,"
4120,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Like Britons meeting in a foreign inn.
4121,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Two portraits graced the wall in grimmest truth,"
4122,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Mister and Mistress W. in their youth,--"
4123,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"New England youth, that seems a sort of pill,"
4124,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Half wish-I-dared, half Edwards on the Will,"
4125,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Bitter to swallow, and which leaves a trace"
4126,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Of Calvinistic cholic on the face.
4127,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Between them, o’er the mantel, hung in state"
4128,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Solomon’s temple, done in copperplate;"
4129,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Invention pure, but meant, we may presume,"
4130,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,To give some Scripture sanction to the room.
4131,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Facing this last, two samplers you might see,"
4132,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Each, with its urn and stiffly-weeping tree,"
4133,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Devoted to some memory long ago
4134,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,More faded than their lines of worsted woe;
4135,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Cut paper decked their frames against the flies,"
4136,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Though none e’er dared an entrance who were wise,"
4137,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And bushed asparagus in fading green
4138,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Added its shiver to the franklin clean.
4139,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4140,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"“When first arrived, I chilled a half-hour there,"
4141,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Nor dared deflower with use a single chair;
4142,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"I caught no cold, yet flying pains could find"
4143,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"For weeks in me,--a rheumatism of mind."
4144,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,One thing alone imprisoned there had power
4145,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,To hold me in the place that long half-hour:
4146,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A scutcheon this, a helm-surmounted shield,"
4147,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Three griffins argent on a sable field;
4148,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A relic of the shipwrecked past was here,"
4149,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And Ezra held some Old-World lumber dear.
4150,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Nay, do not smile; I love this kind of thing,"
4151,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"These cooped traditions with a broken wing,"
4152,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"This freehold nook in Fancy’s pipe-blown ball,"
4153,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,This less than nothing that is more than all!
4154,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Have I not seen sweet natures kept alive
4155,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Amid the humdrum of your business hive,"
4156,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Undowered spinsters shielded from all harms,"
4157,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,By airy incomes from a coat of arms?”
4158,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4159,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He paused a moment, and his features took"
4160,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,The flitting sweetness of that inward look
4161,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"I hinted at before; but, scarcely seen,"
4162,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"It shrank for shelter ’neath his harder mien,"
4163,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And, rapping his black pipe of ashes clear,"
4164,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,He went on with a self-derisive sneer:
4165,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"“No doubt we make a part of God’s design,"
4166,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And break the forest-path for feet divine;
4167,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,To furnish foothold for this grand prevision
4168,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Is good, and yet--to be the mere transition,"
4169,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"That, you will say, is also good, though I"
4170,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Scarce like to feed the ogre By-and-by.
4171,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Raw edges rasp my nerves; my taste is wooed
4172,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"By things that are, not going to be, good,"
4173,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Though were I what I dreamed two lustres gone,"
4174,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"I’d stay to help the Consummation on,"
4175,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Whether a new Rome than the old more fair,"
4176,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Or a deadflat of rascal-ruled despair;
4177,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,But _my_ skull somehow never closed the suture
4178,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"That seems to knit yours firmly with the future,"
4179,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,So you ’ll excuse me if I’m sometimes fain
4180,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,To tie the past’s warm nightcap o’er my brain;
4181,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"I’m quite aware ’tis not in fashion here,"
4182,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,But then your northeast winds are _so_ severe!
4183,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4184,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,“But to my story: though ’tis truly naught
4185,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"But a few hints in Memory’s sketchbook caught,"
4186,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And which may claim a value on the score
4187,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Of calling back some scenery now no more.
4188,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Shall I confess? The tavern’s only Lar
4189,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Seemed (be not shocked!) its homely-featured bar.
4190,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Here dozed a fire of beechen logs, that bred"
4191,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Strange fancies in its embers golden-red,"
4192,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And nursed the loggerhead whose hissing dip,"
4193,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Timed by nice instinct, creamed the mug of flip"
4194,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"That made from mouth to mouth its genial round,"
4195,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Nor left one nature wholly winter-bound;
4196,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Hence dropt the tinkling coal all mellow-ripe
4197,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,For Uncle Reuben’s talk-extinguished pipe;
4198,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Hence rayed the heat, as from an in-door sun,"
4199,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,That wooed forth many a shoot of rustic fun.
4200,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Here Ezra ruled as king by right divine;
4201,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"No other face had such a wholesome shine,"
4202,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,No laugh like his so full of honest cheer;
4203,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Above the rest it crowed like Chanticleer.
4204,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4205,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"“In this one room his dame you never saw,"
4206,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Where reigned by custom old a Salic law;
4207,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Here coatless lolled he on his throne of oak,"
4208,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And every tongue paused midway if he spoke.
4209,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Due mirth he loved, yet was his sway severe;"
4210,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,No blear-eyed driveller got his stagger here;
4211,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"'Measure was happiness; who wanted more,"
4212,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Must buy his ruin at the Deacon’s store;'
4213,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"None but his lodgers after ten could stay,"
4214,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Nor after nine on eves of Sabbath-day.
4215,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He had his favorites and his pensioners,"
4216,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,The same that gypsy Nature owns for hers:
4217,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Loose-ended souls, whose skills bring scanty gold,"
4218,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And whom the poor-house catches when they ’re old;
4219,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Rude country-minstrels, men who doctor kine,"
4220,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Or graft, and, out of scions ten, save nine;"
4221,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Creatures of genius they, but never meant"
4222,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,To keep step with the civic regiment.
4223,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"These Ezra welcomed, feeling in his mind"
4224,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Perhaps some motions of the vagrant kind;
4225,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"These paid no money, yet for them he drew"
4226,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Special Jamaica from a tap they knew,"
4227,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And, for their feelings, chalked behind the door"
4228,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,With solemn face a visionary score.
4229,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,This thawed to life in Uncle Reuben’s throat
4230,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A torpid shoal of jest and anecdote,"
4231,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Like those queer fish that doze the droughts away,"
4232,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And wait for moisture, wrapt in sun-baked clay;"
4233,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"This warmed the one-eyed fiddler to his task,"
4234,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Perched in the corner on an empty cask,"
4235,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"By whose shrill art rapt suddenly, some boor"
4236,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Rattled a double-shuffle on the floor;
4237,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"'Hull’s Victory' was, indeed, the favorite air,"
4238,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Though 'Yankee Doodle' claimed its proper share.
4239,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4240,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"“'Twas there I caught from Uncle Reuben’s lips,"
4241,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"In dribbling monologue ’twixt whiffs and sips,"
4242,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,The story I so long have tried to tell;
4243,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"The humor coarse, the persons common,--well,"
4244,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"From Nature only do I love to paint,"
4245,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Whether she send a satyr or a saint;
4246,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"To me Sincerity’s the one thing good,"
4247,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Soiled though she be and lost to maidenhood.
4248,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Quompegan is a town some ten miles south
4249,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"From Jethro, at Nagumscot river-mouth,"
4250,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A seaport town, and makes its title good"
4251,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,With lumber and dried fish and eastern wood.
4252,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Here Deacon Bitters dwelt and kept the Store,"
4253,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,The richest man for many a mile of shore;
4254,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"In little less than everything dealt he,"
4255,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,From meeting-houses to a chest of tea;
4256,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"So dextrous therewithal a flint to skin,"
4257,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,He could make profit on a single pin;
4258,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"In business strict, to bring the balance true"
4259,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He had been known to bite a fig in two,"
4260,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And change a board-nail for a shingle-nail.
4261,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"All that he had he ready held for sale,"
4262,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"His house, his tomb, whate’er the law allows,"
4263,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And he had gladly parted with his spouse.
4264,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"His one ambition still to get and get,"
4265,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,He would arrest your very ghost for debt.
4266,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"His store looked righteous, should the Parson come,"
4267,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"But in a dark back-room he peddled rum,"
4268,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And eased Ma’am Conscience, if she e’er would scold,"
4269,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,By christening it with water ere he sold.
4270,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A small, dry man he was, who wore a queue,"
4271,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And one white neckcloth all the week-days through,--"
4272,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"On Monday white, by Saturday as dun"
4273,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,As that worn homeward by the prodigal son.
4274,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"His frosted earlocks, striped with foxy brown,"
4275,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Were braided up to hide a desert crown;
4276,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"His coat was brownish, black perhaps of yore;"
4277,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,In summer-time a banyan loose he wore;
4278,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"His trousers short, through many a season true,"
4279,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Made no pretence to hide his stockings blue;
4280,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A waistcoat buff his chief adornment was,"
4281,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Its porcelain buttons rimmed with dusky brass.
4282,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A deacon he, you saw it in each limb,"
4283,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And well he knew to deacon-off a hymn,"
4284,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Or lead the choir through all its wandering woes
4285,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"With voice that gathered unction in his nose,"
4286,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Wherein a constant snuffle you might hear,"
4287,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,As if with him ’twere winter all the year.
4288,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"At pew-head sat he with decorous pains,"
4289,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"In sermon-time could foot his weekly gains,"
4290,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Or, with closed eyes and heaven-abstracted air,"
4291,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Could plan a new investment in long-prayer.
4292,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A pious man, and thrifty too, he made"
4293,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"The psalms and prophets partners in his trade,"
4294,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And in his orthodoxy straitened more
4295,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,As it enlarged the business at his store;
4296,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He honored Moses, but, when gain he planned,"
4297,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Had his own notion of the Promised Land.
4298,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4299,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"“Soon as the winter made the sledding good,"
4300,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"From far around the farmers hauled him wood,"
4301,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,For all the trade had gathered ’neath his thumb.
4302,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He paid in groceries and New England rum,"
4303,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Making two profits with a conscience clear,--"
4304,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Cheap all he bought, and all he paid with dear."
4305,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"With his own mete-wand measuring every load,"
4306,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Each somehow had diminished on the road;
4307,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,An honest cord in Jethro still would fail
4308,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"By a good foot upon the Deacon’s scale,"
4309,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"And, more to abate the price, his gimlet eye"
4310,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Would pierce to cat-sticks that none else could spy;
4311,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Yet none dared grumble, for no farmer yet"
4312,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,But New Year found him in the Deacon’s debt.
4313,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4314,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"“While the first snow was mealy under feet,"
4315,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,A team drawled creaking down Quompegan street.
4316,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Two cords of oak weighed down the grinding sled,"
4317,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,And cornstalk fodder rustled overhead;
4318,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"The oxen’s muzzles, as they shouldered through,"
4319,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Were silver-fringed; the driver’s own was blue
4320,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,As the coarse frock that swung below his knee.
4321,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Behind his load for shelter waded he;
4322,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"His mittened hands now on his chest he beat,"
4323,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"Now stamped the stiffened cowhides of his feet,"
4324,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Hushed as a ghost’s; his armpit scarce could hold
4325,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,The walnut whipstock slippery-bright with cold.
4326,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"What wonder if, the tavern as he past,"
4327,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"He looked and longed, and stayed his beasts at last,"
4328,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,Who patient stood and veiled themselves in steam
4329,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,While he explored the bar-room’s ruddy gleam?
4330,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,
4331,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"“Before the fire, in want of thought profound,"
4332,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,There sat a brother-townsman weather-bound:
4333,FITZ ADAM’S STORY.,"A sturdy churl, crisp-headed, bristly-eared,"

4669,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"To large estates of doubts and snares,"
4670,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"By proving that the title-deeds,"
4671,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"Once all-sufficient for men’s needs,"
4672,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,Are palimpsests that scarce disguise
4673,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"The tracings of still earlier lies,"
4674,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,Themselves as surely written o’er
4675,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,An older fib erased before.
4676,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,
4677,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,So from these days I fly to those
4678,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"That in the landlocked Past repose,"
4679,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,Where no rude wind of doctrine shakes
4680,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,From bloom-flushed boughs untimely flakes;
4681,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"Where morning’s eyes see nothing strange,"
4682,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"No crude perplexity of change,"
4683,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,And morrows trip along their ways
4684,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,Secure as happy yesterdays.
4685,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,Then there were rulers who could trace
4686,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"Through heroes up to gods their race,"
4687,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,Pledged to fair fame and noble use
4688,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"By veins from Odin filled or Zeus,"
4689,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,And under bonds to keep divine
4690,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,The praise of a celestial line.
4691,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"Then priests could pile the altar’s sods,"
4692,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"With whom gods spake as they with gods,"
4693,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,And everywhere from haunted earth
4694,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"Broke springs of wonder, that had birth"
4695,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,In depths divine beyond the ken
4696,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,And fatal scrutiny of men;

4698,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"Thrilled with immortal presences,"
4699,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,Not too ethereal for the scope
4700,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,Of human passion’s dream or hope.
4701,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,
4702,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"Now Pan at last is surely dead,"

4706,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"Chase the last Genius from the door,"
4707,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,And nothing dances any more.
4708,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"Nothing? Ah, yes, our tables do,"
4709,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"Drumming the Old One’s own tattoo,"
4710,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"And, if the oracles are dumb,"

4726,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"All ask at once, all wait reply."
4727,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,Men feel old systems cracking under ’em;
4728,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,Life saddens to a mere conundrum
4729,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"Which once Religion solved, but she"

4741,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE.,"With scarcely wit a stone to fling,"

4911,TEMPORA MUTANTUR.,From words to modify our sense of things.

4913,TEMPORA MUTANTUR.,"Man, if he will, may pardon; but the State"

4969,TEMPORA MUTANTUR.,"A public meeting, treated at his cost,"
4970,TEMPORA MUTANTUR.,Resolves him back more virtue than he lost;
