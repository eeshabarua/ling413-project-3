111,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,
112,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,"The apple tree has fallen, now--"
113,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,The axe has laid it low;
114,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,"The blossoms sparkled ere it fell,"
115,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,But now they wither so.
116,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,
117,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,Its shade we now shall seek in vain--
118,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,The spot we loved so well
119,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,Has vanished since the apple tree
120,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,So loudly crashing fell.
121,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,
122,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,"No more the wind sings through the leaves,"
123,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,The song so dear to me;
124,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,"Ah! yes, that rustling far above"
125,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,Was one of melody.
126,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,
127,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,No more we see that staunch old tree--
128,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,"The axe has laid it low,"
129,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,"And much we’ll miss it, evermore,"
130,FALLING OF THE APPLE TREE.,That fall was one of woe.

136,THE ANGELS.,
137,THE ANGELS.,
138,THE ANGELS.,"The Angel of Peace flew over the land,"
139,THE ANGELS.,And the country was wild with glee;
140,THE ANGELS.,And she stilled the wave in the stormy night
141,THE ANGELS.,On a rolling and restless sea.
142,THE ANGELS.,
143,THE ANGELS.,But the Angel of Death flew over the land
144,THE ANGELS.,And a babe was taken that night.
145,THE ANGELS.,And an angel sweet in heaven appeared
146,THE ANGELS.,In the land of glory and light.

151,THE SPECTRES.,THE SPECTRES.
152,THE SPECTRES.,
153,THE SPECTRES.,
154,THE SPECTRES.,In a palace sad and lonely
155,THE SPECTRES.,Flit two spectres all the day--
156,THE SPECTRES.,Spectres chasing joy and brightness
157,THE SPECTRES.,From each window far away.
158,THE SPECTRES.,
159,THE SPECTRES.,"One is Sorrow clad in raiment,"
160,THE SPECTRES.,"Sombre as the shades of night,"
161,THE SPECTRES.,While her trailing robes of darkness
162,THE SPECTRES.,Chase away each ray of light.
163,THE SPECTRES.,
164,THE SPECTRES.,But the other one is Envy
165,THE SPECTRES.,"Clad in blackness, clad with woe,"
166,THE SPECTRES.,"Sorrow’s only sad companion,"
167,THE SPECTRES.,Flitting ever to and fro.
168,THE SPECTRES.,
169,THE SPECTRES.,"By the windows ever gliding,"
170,THE SPECTRES.,Filling all with thoughts of pain;
171,THE SPECTRES.,"All who gaze are doomed forever,"
172,THE SPECTRES.,Ne’er to see bright joy again.

177,THE YEARS.,THE YEARS.
178,THE YEARS.,
179,THE YEARS.,
180,THE YEARS.,"All around us, ever floating,"
181,THE YEARS.,"Silently yet swiftly on,"
182,THE YEARS.,Pass the years in quick succession--
183,THE YEARS.,Years that are forever gone.
184,THE YEARS.,
185,THE YEARS.,Years that soon are past recalling.
186,THE YEARS.,Years of gladness or of woe;
187,THE YEARS.,We can never stop their fleeting
188,THE YEARS.,But forever they will go.
189,THE YEARS.,
190,THE YEARS.,"Years of sorrow passing round us,"
191,THE YEARS.,Dark and dreary as the night.
192,THE YEARS.,Years of gladness quickly follow
193,THE YEARS.,Bringing thoughts all fair and bright.
194,THE YEARS.,
195,THE YEARS.,Still the years continue passing
196,THE YEARS.,"Swiftly as the years can be,"
197,THE YEARS.,Till we leave our pains and sorrow;
198,THE YEARS.,Till we find eternity.

207,MY THOUGHTS.,That would my thoughts convey.
208,MY THOUGHTS.,There were a mighty pen that would
209,MY THOUGHTS.,The world astound to-day.
210,MY THOUGHTS.,
211,MY THOUGHTS.,They come and go as fountains flow:
212,MY THOUGHTS.,"Unceasing, always flowing,"
213,MY THOUGHTS.,For while some thoughts are coming fast
214,MY THOUGHTS.,The others fast are going.

223,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Pictures come and pictures go--
224,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Pictures of the waiting future
225,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Filled with gladness or with woe.
226,BY THE FIRESIDE.,
227,BY THE FIRESIDE.,By the fireside do I picture
228,BY THE FIRESIDE.,To myself my destiny.
229,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Who knows but these golden raptures
230,BY THE FIRESIDE.,May be real unto me.
231,BY THE FIRESIDE.,
232,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Though the storm outside be raving
233,BY THE FIRESIDE.,And the snowflakes drift on high;
234,BY THE FIRESIDE.,By the fireside I am safely
235,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Counting on what may be nigh.
236,BY THE FIRESIDE.,
237,BY THE FIRESIDE.,All the flames fly ever upward
238,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Coiling into every form.
239,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Fairies circle ever round me
240,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Heedless of the outside storm.
241,BY THE FIRESIDE.,
242,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Still I watch the weird wild raptures
243,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Of the golden dream so nigh.
244,BY THE FIRESIDE.,Let us love our happy fancies
245,BY THE FIRESIDE.,E’er the time has passed us by.

251,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,
252,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,
253,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,See the grass upon its threshold;
254,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,See the ivy on its wall;
255,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,"Vacant are its crumbling windows,"
256,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,Vacant is its mossy hall.
257,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,
258,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,Ah! the step of man upon it
259,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,"Shall resound along no more,"
260,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,For the spirits of the dead ones
261,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,Ever flit about the door.
262,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,
263,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,There the whisperings of the voices
264,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,Of the spirits of the dead;
265,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,Those of friends and enemies
266,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,Ever murmur ’round your head.
267,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,
268,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,Let us leave the haunted ruin;
269,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,Spirits walk the crumbling floor;
270,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,"Light their step, but oh! their voices"
271,THE HAUNTED HOUSE.,Haunt the building evermore.

276,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.
277,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,
278,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,
279,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,Peaceful be for we have reached it
280,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,"Lighter, lighter ever tread,"
281,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,’Tis a sacred spot and hallowed:
282,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,’Tis the kingdom of the dead.
283,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,
284,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,"Silent kingdom, sad and lonely,"
285,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,Though so many in it dwell.
286,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,Who can number all its people?
287,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,"Who, ah! who can ever tell?"

289,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,Still and peaceful is their resting
290,THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD.,In their last and humble bed.

298,THE WIND.,
299,THE WIND.,
300,THE WIND.,"Hear ye not the howling wind,"
301,THE WIND.,Sad and wild?
302,THE WIND.,In its wake come dismal fancies
303,THE WIND.,Never mild.
304,THE WIND.,
305,THE WIND.,Like the moaning of the lost
306,THE WIND.,Comes the wind:
307,THE WIND.,"Moaning, sighing--viewless phantoms"
308,THE WIND.,Come behind.
309,THE WIND.,
310,THE WIND.,In the darkness come the spirits
311,THE WIND.,"Of the night,"
312,THE WIND.,"Howling, with their dismal groaning"
313,THE WIND.,In their flight.
314,THE WIND.,
315,THE WIND.,Absent friends come in our fancies
316,THE WIND.,"Evermore,"
317,THE WIND.,As the demons flee from Hades
318,THE WIND.,Rush and roar.
319,THE WIND.,
320,THE WIND.,Hear ye not the moaning wind
321,THE WIND.,Moan and quiver
322,THE WIND.,Like the moaning of the lost--
323,THE WIND.,Lost forever?

325,THE WIND.,
326,THE WIND.,
327,THE WIND.,
328,THE SONG OF THE WIND.,THE SONG OF THE WIND.
329,THE SONG OF THE WIND.,
330,THE SONG OF THE WIND.,
331,I.,I.
332,I.,
333,I.,Over hill and over valley--
334,I.,"Over meadows rich and green,"
335,I.,Playing with the summer grasses--
336,I.,Fairer sights were never seen.
337,I.,
338,I.,"Not a mortal ever saw me,"
339,I.,Though I see THEM ev’ry day;
340,I.,Passing like a viewless spirit
341,I.,On my happy singing way.
342,I.,
343,I.,"Often do I rise up skyward,"
344,I.,"Chasing fast the cloudlets there,"
345,I.,And I drive them headlong onward
346,I.,Till they all in fragments tear.
347,I.,
348,I.,"Often on the field of battle,"
349,I.,"’Mid the storm that works them woe,"
350,I.,"Do I cheer ’mid cannon’s rattle,"
351,I.,Kissing both the friend and foe.
352,I.,
353,I.,"And the wounded, as he listens"
354,I.,"To me as I whistle on,"
355,I.,Thinks of home and friends and parents
356,I.,And of days that now have gone.
357,I.,
358,I.,I often whistle through the woods
359,I.,And toss the hunter’s hair.
360,I.,"He sits him down upon a log,"
361,I.,While I caress him there.
362,I.,
363,I.,His brow with sweat is covered o’er--
364,I.,"He feels my cooling sway,"
365,I.,I toss about his silver locks;
366,I.,That deck his head of gray.
367,I.,
368,I.,But on I go until I find
369,I.,The farmer in his field;
370,I.,I whistle o’er his garnered store
371,I.,The willing land doth yield.
372,I.,
373,I.,"He hails me as his merry friend,"
374,I.,And thus I am to him;
375,I.,I never pass without I cheer
376,I.,His features calm and grim.
377,I.,
378,I.,I cheer the poet as he sings
379,I.,"Beside some flowing stream,"
380,I.,"And looks upon the dim, dim past,"
381,I.,A vision or a dream.
382,I.,
383,I.,
384,II.,II.
385,II.,
386,II.,"He hails me, as I sail along,"
387,II.,In accents clear and free.
388,II.,I answer in an unknown tongue
389,II.,And pass on cheerily.
390,II.,
391,II.,"He knows me well, and loves me too--"
392,II.,He watches till I find
393,II.,His resting place where he may leave
394,II.,All earthly cares behind.
395,II.,
396,II.,"I visit oft where lovers sit,"
397,II.,I hear their vows of love;
398,II.,The bright green grass is all below--
399,II.,The sky of blue above.
400,II.,
401,II.,And there they sit and talk of love--
402,II.,As only lovers know;--
403,II.,They think the world a paradise
404,II.,And all things bright below.
405,II.,
406,II.,
407,III.,III.
408,III.,
409,III.,"I visit oft the city’s haunts,--"
410,III.,"I raise the dust on high,"
411,III.,"And whirl it like a water-wheel,"
412,III.,As ever on I fly.
413,III.,
414,III.,"I play with wigs and hats and cloaks,"
415,III.,And whistle by the house--
416,III.,"Then to a gentle zephyr turn,--"
417,III.,As quiet as a mouse.
418,III.,
419,III.,"Then breaking in an angry fit,"
420,III.,I whistle by the bell
421,III.,That hangs within the steeple tall--
422,III.,"And sound a faint, low knell."
423,III.,
424,III.,By ruins old I make my way--
425,III.,"I tear the ivy vines,"
426,III.,And fill with dust and sand and dirt
427,III.,The ancient sculptured lines.
428,III.,
429,III.,
430,IV.,IV.
431,IV.,
432,IV.,"I ramble on the deep, dark sea,"
433,IV.,And toss those waves of blue;
434,IV.,I scare the boasting mariner
435,IV.,And tear the sails in two.
436,IV.,
437,IV.,The clouds that hang far overhead
438,IV.,"Are dropping to the sea,"
439,IV.,The waves as mountains now become--
440,IV.,I roar out in my glee.
441,IV.,
442,IV.,The captain stands with face aghast--
443,IV.,With terror in his eyes--
444,IV.,The fork-ed lightning strikes its wings
445,IV.,That waft it from the skies.
446,IV.,
447,IV.,"The thunder stops, the clouds pass by,"
448,IV.,The waves are resting now;
449,IV.,The gallant ship before my breath
450,IV.,With magic speed doth plow.
451,IV.,
452,IV.,
453,V.,V.
454,V.,
455,V.,"Ye frightened goodly mariners,"
456,V.,That angels were before--
457,V.,"The storm has quit, you curse again,"
458,V.,You’re sinners wild once more.
459,V.,
460,V.,"And when the next storm rocks the ship,"
461,V.,"And the thunders roll and roar,"
462,V.,You drop upon your knees again--
463,V.,Art sainted then once more.
464,V.,
465,V.,"I cross the sea, and soon I find"
466,V.,Europa’s golden coast--
467,V.,The Spanish pride;--the English tar
468,V.,Makes well his frequent boast.
469,V.,
470,V.,
471,VI.,VI.
472,VI.,
473,VI.,I love the clime of Africa--
474,VI.,The dark man’s native home;
475,VI.,"I love that central, torrid zone"
476,VI.,Wherever I may roam.
477,VI.,
478,VI.,I also love the Northern pole--
479,VI.,Auroras glisten there--
480,VI.,"I love the regions still and cold,"
481,VI.,The icebergs standing bare.
482,VI.,
483,VI.,The water trickling down their sides--
484,VI.,I waft them towards the south;
485,VI.,"The walrus suns him as we go,"
486,VI.,And opes his giant mouth.
487,VI.,
488,VI.,I love to sway the trees in spring
489,VI.,"When all in green they stand,--"
490,VI.,In winter do I move their boughs
491,VI.,While roaming o’er the land.
492,VI.,
493,VI.,Sometimes I frolic round about
494,VI.,Between the earth and sky;
495,VI.,And it is true where’er I go
496,VI.,A jolly one am I.
497,VI.,
498,VI.,I love to whirl the storm around
499,VI.,"And roar out ev’rywhere,"
500,VI.,"And superstitious people, too,"
501,VI.,I often sadly scare.
502,VI.,
503,VI.,I’ve seen fair Eden’s leafy trees--
504,VI.,"I’ve seen the first of man,"
505,VI.,And I shall see the last of him--
506,VI.,I saw how he began.
507,VI.,
508,VI.,
509,VII.,VII.
510,VII.,
511,VII.,I saw the star of Bethlehem--
512,VII.,I heard the angels sing;
513,VII.,I saw the manger and the Christ--
514,VII.,The great and goodly king.
515,VII.,
516,VII.,I saw the Cæsar in his Rome--
517,VII.,Who raised her towers on high;
518,VII.,"She raised those towers aloof from earth,"
519,VII.,"She rose, and but to die."
520,VII.,
521,VII.,Then passing in the flight of years
522,VII.,I saw Napoleon’s day;
523,VII.,"I saw the time when he did rise,"
524,VII.,And when he fell away.
525,VII.,
526,VII.,"I saw the hero, Washington,"
527,VII.,Who for his country fought.
528,VII.,"“I’ll free my country from her bonds,”"
529,VII.,That was his only thought.
530,VII.,
531,VII.,I’ve known more things than history--
532,VII.,"And if I brought to light,"
533,VII.,These things ’twould make the stoutest heart
534,VII.,To start aback with fright.
535,VII.,
536,VII.,I’ve witnessed murders never seen
537,VII.,By any human eye;
538,VII.,I’ve seen the very best of men
539,VII.,By violence to die.
540,VII.,
541,VII.,I’ve touched the knife that did the deed;
542,VII.,I’ve kissed the brow in vain;
543,VII.,"No sign of life upon the face,"
544,VII.,So dark and black with pain.
545,VII.,
546,VII.,
547,VIII.,VIII.

611,HASTINGS.,"Oh, bright the day when England’s crown"
612,HASTINGS.,Came forth to crown the king;
613,HASTINGS.,And in the minds of those around
614,HASTINGS.,It seemed no trifling thing.
615,HASTINGS.,
616,HASTINGS.,"“Give back the crown!” was William’s word,"
617,HASTINGS.,"“Or my good sword shall pay,"

620,HASTINGS.,
621,HASTINGS.,For Edward’s will that crown had sent
622,HASTINGS.,"To grace stern William’s head,"

625,HASTINGS.,
626,HASTINGS.,"Aye! bled, and died, and lost the crown"
627,HASTINGS.,"He’d struggled so to save,"
628,HASTINGS.,And ah! that struggle led him to
629,HASTINGS.,His solitary grave.
630,HASTINGS.,
631,HASTINGS.,Yes! Godwin’s son was born to fight--
632,HASTINGS.,"To chase and not to fly,"

635,HASTINGS.,
636,HASTINGS.,Ah! weep ye noble Saxon men--

660,HASTINGS.,
661,HASTINGS.,"The cup went round,--and small thought they"

664,HASTINGS.,Within the waning light.
665,HASTINGS.,
666,HASTINGS.,"In William’s camp no cup went round,"
667,HASTINGS.,"But heads were bent in prayer,"

669,HASTINGS.,Its peaceful reigning there.
670,HASTINGS.,
671,HASTINGS.,Oh! solemn was the prayer they said--

680,HASTINGS.,
681,HASTINGS.,"And in the midst, his armor bright,"

683,HASTINGS.,And far and near around stood those
684,HASTINGS.,Who waited at his word.
685,HASTINGS.,
686,HASTINGS.,The banner rose above them all--
687,HASTINGS.,"Its warrior stood on high,"

689,HASTINGS.,That scarcely wealth could buy.
690,HASTINGS.,
691,HASTINGS.,Duke William led his heroes forth

695,HASTINGS.,
696,HASTINGS.,"The battle raged, and sunset came,"
697,HASTINGS.,"And flashed on armor bright,"
698,HASTINGS.,And all around were mangled men--
699,HASTINGS.,It was an awful sight.
700,HASTINGS.,
701,HASTINGS.,"King Harold fell, the arrow pierced"
702,HASTINGS.,And bore him to the ground;
703,HASTINGS.,Ah! then was heard a trampling noise--
704,HASTINGS.,A wildly flying sound.
705,HASTINGS.,
706,HASTINGS.,"The warrior and the banner fell,"
