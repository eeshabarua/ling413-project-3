82,SURRENDER.,SURRENDER.
83,SURRENDER.,
84,SURRENDER.,
85,SURRENDER.,"Love, when we met, ’twas like two planets meeting."
86,SURRENDER.,"Strange chaos followed; body, soul, and heart"
87,SURRENDER.,"Seemed shaken, thrilled, and startled by that greeting."
88,SURRENDER.,"Old ties, old dreams, old aims, all torn apart"
89,SURRENDER.,"And wrenched away, left nothing there the while"
90,SURRENDER.,But the great shining glory of your smile.
91,SURRENDER.,
92,SURRENDER.,"I knew no past; ’twas all a blurred, bleak waste;"
93,SURRENDER.,I asked no future; ’twas a blinding glare.
94,SURRENDER.,I only saw the present: as men taste
95,SURRENDER.,"Some stimulating wine, and lose all care,"
96,SURRENDER.,"I tasted Love’s elixir, and I seemed"
97,SURRENDER.,"Dwelling in some strange land, like one who dreamed."
98,SURRENDER.,
99,SURRENDER.,It was a godlike separate existence;
100,SURRENDER.,Our world was set apart in some fair clime.
101,SURRENDER.,"I had no will, no purpose, no resistance;"
102,SURRENDER.,I only knew I loved you for all time.
103,SURRENDER.,"The earth seemed something foreign and afar,"
104,SURRENDER.,"And we two, sovereigns dwelling in a star!"
105,SURRENDER.,
106,SURRENDER.,"It is so sad, so strange, I almost doubt"
107,SURRENDER.,"That all those years could be, before we met."
108,SURRENDER.,Do you not wish that we could blot them out?
109,SURRENDER.,"Obliterate them wholly, and forget"
110,SURRENDER.,That we had any part in life until
111,SURRENDER.,We clasped each other with Love’s rapture thrill?
112,SURRENDER.,
113,SURRENDER.,My being trembled to its very center
114,SURRENDER.,At that first kiss. Cold Reason stood aside
115,SURRENDER.,With folded arms to let a grand Love enter
116,SURRENDER.,In my Soul’s secret chamber to abide.
117,SURRENDER.,"Its great High Priest, my first love and my last,"
118,SURRENDER.,There on its altar I consumed my past.
119,SURRENDER.,
120,SURRENDER.,And all my life I lay upon its shrine
121,SURRENDER.,"The best emotions of my heart and brain,"
122,SURRENDER.,Whatever gifts and graces may be mine;
123,SURRENDER.,"No secret thought, no memory I retain,"
124,SURRENDER.,But give them all for dear Love’s precious sake;
125,SURRENDER.,Complete surrender of the whole I make.

130,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.
131,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,
132,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,
133,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"The Sunbeam loved the Moonbeam,"
134,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"And followed her low and high,"
135,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"But the Moonbeam fled and hid her head,"
136,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,She was so shy--so shy.
137,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,
138,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,The Sunbeam wooed with passion;
139,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"Ah, he was a lover bold!"
140,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,And his heart was afire with mad desire
141,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,For the Moonbeam pale and cold.
142,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,
143,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"She fled like a dream before him,"
144,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"Her hair was a shining sheen,"
145,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"And oh, that Fate would annihilate"
146,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,The space that lay between!
147,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,
148,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,Just as the day lay panting
149,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"In the arms of the twilight dim,"
150,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,The Sunbeam caught the one he sought
151,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,And drew her close to him.
152,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,
153,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"But out of his warm arms, startled"
154,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"And stirred by Love’s first shock,"
155,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"She sprang afraid, like a trembling maid,"
156,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,And hid in the niche of a rock.
157,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,
158,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"And the Sunbeam followed and found her,"
159,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,And led her to Love’s own feast;
160,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"And they were wed on that rocky bed,"
161,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,And the dying Day was their priest.
162,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,
163,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,And lo! the beautiful Opal--
164,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,That rare and wondrous gem--
165,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,"Where the moon and sun blend into one,"
166,THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL.,Is the child that was born to them.

180,THE DIFFERENCE.,"Passion is what God felt, the Holy One,"
181,THE DIFFERENCE.,"Who loved the world so, He begot his Son."

184,THE DIFFERENCE.,"To Eden had, when he taught Eve to sin."
185,THE DIFFERENCE.,
186,THE DIFFERENCE.,"One sprang from light, and one from darkness grew"
187,THE DIFFERENCE.,How dim the vision that confounds the two!

199,TWO LOVES.,
200,TWO LOVES.,"The woman he worshiped only smiled,"
201,TWO LOVES.,When he poured out his passionate love.

203,TWO LOVES.,A book he had touched with his glove.
204,TWO LOVES.,
205,TWO LOVES.,"The woman he loved betrayed his trust,"
206,TWO LOVES.,And he wore the scars for life;

208,TWO LOVES.,But no man called her his wife.
209,TWO LOVES.,
210,TWO LOVES.,"The woman he loved trod festal halls,"

232,THE WAY OF IT.,One speaks and the other hears.
233,THE WAY OF IT.,"One sobs, “I love you,” and wet eyes show it,"
234,THE WAY OF IT.,"And one laughs lightly, and says “I know it,”"
235,THE WAY OF IT.,With smiles for the other’s tears.

349,THE INSTRUCTOR.,
350,THE INSTRUCTOR.,"Not till Love comes in all his strength and terror,"
351,THE INSTRUCTOR.,Can we read other’s hearts; not till then know
352,THE INSTRUCTOR.,"A wide compassion for all human error,"

354,THE INSTRUCTOR.,
355,THE INSTRUCTOR.,"Not till we sail with him o’er stormy oceans,"

378,BLASE.,Its women mere puppets of fashion;
379,BLASE.,Life now is a comedy play.
380,BLASE.,"Our Abelard sighs for a season,"
381,BLASE.,Then yields with decorum to fate.
382,BLASE.,"Our Heloise listens to reason,"
383,BLASE.,And seeks a new mate.
384,BLASE.,
385,BLASE.,Our Romeo’s flippant emotion
386,BLASE.,Grows pale as the summer grows old;
387,BLASE.,Our Juliet proves her devotion
388,BLASE.,By clasping--a cup filled with gold.
389,BLASE.,Vain Anthony boasts of his favors
390,BLASE.,"From fair Cleopatra the frail,"

397,BLASE.,All fresh with the imprint of God.
398,BLASE.,"High culture emasculates feeling,"
399,BLASE.,"The over-taught brain robs the heart,"

401,BLASE.,Is a commonplace mart.
402,BLASE.,
403,BLASE.,Our effeminate fathers and brothers
404,BLASE.,"Keep carefully out of life’s storm,"

406,BLASE.,We are taught that to feel is “bad form.”
407,BLASE.,Our worshipers now and our lovers
408,BLASE.,"Are calmly devout with their brains,"
409,BLASE.,And we laugh at the man who discovers
410,BLASE.,Warm blood in his veins.
411,BLASE.,
412,BLASE.,"But you, O twin souls, passion-mated,"
413,BLASE.,"Who love as the gods loved of old,"
414,BLASE.,What blundering destiny fated
415,BLASE.,Your lives to be cast in this mold?
416,BLASE.,"Like a lurid volcanic upheaval,"
417,BLASE.,"In pastures prosaic and gray,"
418,BLASE.,"You seem with your fervors primeval,"
419,BLASE.,Among us to-day.
420,BLASE.,
421,BLASE.,"You dropped from some planet of splendor,"
422,BLASE.,"Perhaps as it circled afar,"
423,BLASE.,"And your constancy, swerveless and tender,"
424,BLASE.,You learned from the course of that star.
425,BLASE.,"Fly back to its bosom, I warn you--"
426,BLASE.,As back to the ark flew the dove--
427,BLASE.,"The minions of earth will but scorn you,"
428,BLASE.,Because you can love.

437,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,Fluttered a scarf of blue;
438,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"And a gay, bold breeze paused to flatter and tease"
439,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,This trifle of delicate hue.
440,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"“You are lovelier far than the proud skies are,”"
441,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,He said with a voice that sighed;
442,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"“You are fairer to me than the beautiful sea,"
443,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"Oh, why do you stay here and hide?"
444,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,
445,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"“You are wasting your life in that dull, dark room"
446,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"(And he fondled her silken folds),"
447,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"O’er the casement lean but a little, my Queen,"
448,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,And see what the great world holds.
449,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"How the wonderful blue of your matchless hue,"
450,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,Cheapens both sea and sky--
451,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"You are far too bright to be hidden from sight,"
452,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"Come, fly with me, darling--fly.”"
453,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,
454,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"Tender his whisper and sweet his caress,"

457,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,The casement out to sea.
458,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,"Close to his breast she was fondly pressed,"
459,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,Kissed once by his laughing mouth;
460,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,Then dropped to her grave in the cruel wave
461,THE SEA-BREEZE AND THE SCARF.,While the wind went whistling south.
