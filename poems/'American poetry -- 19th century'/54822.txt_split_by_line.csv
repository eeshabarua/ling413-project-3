222,I,"THE mare is pawing by the oak,"
223,I,The chaise is cool and wide
224,I,For Peter Rugg the Bostonian
225,I,With his little son beside;
226,I,The women loiter at the wheels
227,I,In the pleasant summer-tide.
228,I,
229,I,"“And when wilt thou be home, Father?”"
230,I,"“And when, good husband, say:"
231,I,The cloud hangs heavy on the house
232,I,What time thou art away.”
233,I,"He answers straight, he answers short,"

240,I,"God willing or God unwilling,"

242,I,
243,I,He gathers up the sunburnt boy
244,I,And from the gate is sped;
245,I,"He shakes the spark from the stones below,"
246,I,"The bloom from overhead,"
247,I,Till the last roofs of his own town
248,I,Pass in the morning-red.
249,I,
250,I,Upon a homely mission
251,I,"North unto York he goes,"
252,I,Through the long highway broidered thick
253,I,With elder-blow and rose;
254,I,And sleeps in sound of breakers

256,I,
257,I,Intense upon his heedless head

265,II,II
266,II,
267,II,Full light are all his parting dreams;
268,II,Desire is in his brain;
269,II,He tightens at the tavern-post
270,II,The fiery creature’s rein:
271,II,"“Now eat thine apple, six years’ child!"
272,II,We face for home again.”
273,II,
274,II,They had not gone a many mile
275,II,"With nimble heart and tongue,"
276,II,When the lone thrush grew silent
277,II,The walnut woods among;
278,II,And on the lulled horizon
279,II,A premonition hung.
280,II,
281,II,"The babes at Hampton schoolhouse,"
282,II,"The wife with lads at sea,"
283,II,Search with a level-lifted hand
284,II,The distance bodingly;
285,II,And farmer folk bid pilgrims in
286,II,Under a safe roof-tree.
287,II,
288,II,The mowers mark by Newbury
289,II,"How low the swallows fly,"
290,II,They glance across the southern roads
291,II,"All white and fever-dry,"
292,II,"And the river, anxious at the bend,"
293,II,Beneath a thinking sky.
294,II,
295,II,But there is one abroad was born
296,II,To disbelieve and dare:
297,II,Along the highway furiously
298,II,He cuts the purple air.
299,II,The wind leaps on the startled world
300,II,As hounds upon a hare;
301,II,
302,II,With brawl and glare and shudder ope
303,II,The sluices of the storm;
304,II,"The woods break down, the sand upblows"
305,II,In blinding volleys warm;
306,II,The yellow floods in frantic surge
307,II,Familiar fields deform.
308,II,
309,II,From evening until morning
310,II,"His skill will not avail,"
311,II,"And as he cheers his youngest born,"
312,II,His cheek is spectre-pale;
313,II,For the bonnie mare from courses known
314,II,Has drifted like a sail!
315,II,
316,II,
317,III,III
318,III,
319,III,On some wild crag he sees the dawn
320,III,Unsheathe her scimitar.
321,III,"“Oh, if it be my mother-earth,"
322,III,"And not a foreign star,"
323,III,"Tell me the way to Boston,"
324,III,And is it near or far?”
325,III,
326,III,One watchman lifts his lamp and laughs:
327,III,“Ye’ve many a league to wend.”
328,III,The next doth bless the sleeping boy
329,III,From his mad father’s end;
330,III,A third upon a drawbridge growls:
331,III,"“Bear ye to larboard, friend.”"
332,III,
333,III,"Forward and backward, like a stone"

339,III,
340,III,"And journeying, and resting scarce"
341,III,"A melancholy space,"
342,III,"Turns to and fro, and round and round,"

344,III,"And ends alway in angrier mood,"
345,III,"And in a stranger place,"
346,III,
347,III,Lost! lost in bayberry thickets
348,III,"Where Plymouth plovers run,"
349,III,And where the masts of Salem
350,III,Look lordly in the sun;
351,III,"Lost in the Concord vale, and lost"
352,III,By rocky Wollaston!
353,III,
354,III,"Small thanks have they that guide him,"
355,III,Awed and aware of blight;
356,III,To hear him shriek denial
357,III,It sickens them with fright:
358,III,“They lied to me a month ago
359,III,With thy same lie to-night!”
360,III,
361,III,"To-night, to-night, as nights succeed,"
362,III,"He swears at home to bide,"
363,III,"Until, pursued with laughter"
364,III,"Or fled as soon as spied,"
365,III,The weather-drenchèd man is known
366,III,Over the country side!

375,IV,"“O Boston, Boston, Boston!"
376,IV,And O my kith and kin!”
377,IV,
378,IV,"The snow climbs o’er the pasture wall,"
379,IV,It crackles ’neath the moon;
380,IV,"And now the rustic sows the seed,"
381,IV,Damp in his heavy shoon;
382,IV,And now the building jays are loud
383,IV,In canopies of June.
384,IV,
385,IV,For season after season
386,IV,"The three are whirled along,"
387,IV,Misled by every instinct
388,IV,"Of light, or scent, or song;"
389,IV,"Yea, put them on the surest trail,"
390,IV,The trail is in the wrong.
391,IV,
392,IV,Upon those wheels in any path
393,IV,"The rain will follow loud,"
394,IV,And he who meets that ghostly man
395,IV,"Will meet a thunder-cloud,"
396,IV,And whosoever speaks with him
397,IV,May next bespeak his shroud.
398,IV,
399,IV,"Tho’ nigh two hundred years have gone,"
400,IV,Doth Peter Rugg the more
401,IV,A gentle answer and a true
402,IV,Of living lips implore:

413,V,"The gabled neighborhood, the stocks"
414,V,Set in the middle street?
415,V,
416,V,How shall he know his own town
417,V,If now he clatters thro’?
418,V,Much men and cities change that have
419,V,Another love to woo;
420,V,"And things occult, incredible,"
421,V,They find to think and do.
422,V,
423,V,With such new wonders since he went
424,V,"A broader gossip copes,"
425,V,"Across the crowded triple hills,"
426,V,"And up the harbor slopes,"
427,V,Tradition’s self for him no more
428,V,"Remembers, watches, hopes."
429,V,
430,V,"But ye, O unborn children!"

432,V,And drip away like icicles

437,V,"If nigh the city, folding in"
438,V,"A little lad that cries,"
439,V,A wet and weary traveller
440,V,"Shall fix you with his eyes,"
441,V,And from the crazy carriage lean
442,V,To spend his heart in sighs:--
443,V,
444,V,"“That I may enter Boston,"
445,V,"Oh, help it to befall!"
446,V,"There would no fear encompass me,"
447,V,No evil craft appall;

450,V,

465,V,"“In Clent cow-batch, Kenelm King born Lieth under a thorn.”"
466,V,
467,V,
468,V,"IT was a goodly child,"
469,V,Sweet as the gusty May;
470,V,It was a knight that broke
471,V,"On his play,"
472,V,A fair and coaxing knight:
473,V,"“O little liege!” said he,"
474,V,“Thy sister bids thee come
475,V,After me.
476,V,
477,V,“A pasture rolling west
478,V,"Lies open to the sun,"
479,V,Bright-shod with primroses
480,V,Doth it run;
481,V,"And forty oaks be nigh,"
482,V,"Apart, and face to face,"
483,V,And cow-bells all the morn
484,V,In the space.
485,V,
486,V,“And there the sloethorn bush
487,V,"Beside the water grows,"
488,V,And hides her mocking head
489,V,Under snows;
490,V,"Black stalks afoam with bloom,"
491,V,And never a leaf hath she:
492,V,"Thou crystal of the realm,"
493,V,Follow me!”
494,V,
495,V,Uplooked the undefiled:
496,V,"“All things, ere I was born"
497,V,My sister found; now find
498,V,Me the thorn.”
499,V,"They travelled down the lane,"
500,V,An hour’s dust they made:
501,V,The belted breast of one
502,V,Bore a blade.
503,V,
504,V,"The primroses were out,"
505,V,"The aislèd oaks were green,"
506,V,The cow-bells pleasantly
507,V,Tinked between;
508,V,"The brook was beaded gold,"
509,V,"The thorn was burgeoning,"
510,V,Where evil Ascobert
511,V,Slew the King.
512,V,
513,V,"He hid him in the ground,"
514,V,"Nor washed away the dyes,"
515,V,Nor smoothed the fallen curls
516,V,From his eyes.
517,V,No father had the babe
518,V,To bless his bed forlorn;
519,V,No mother now to weep
520,V,By the thorn.
521,V,
522,V,There fell upon that place
523,V,A shaft of heavenly light;
524,V,The thorn in Mercia spake
525,V,Ere the night:
526,V,"“Beyond, a sister sees"
527,V,"Her crownèd period,"
528,V,But at my root a lamb
529,V,Seeth God.”
530,V,
531,V,"Unto each, even so."
532,V,"As dew before the cloud,"
533,V,The guilty glory passed
534,V,Of the proud.
535,V,"Boy Kenelm has the song,"
536,V,Saint Kenelm has the bower;
537,V,His thorn a thousand years
538,V,Is in flower!

2289,TWELVE SONNETS,"Corrode thee quite, thy lover sighs, and straight"
2290,TWELVE SONNETS,"Desires thee safe afar, too graceful gate!"
2291,TWELVE SONNETS,Throned on a terrace of the Boboli.
2292,TWELVE SONNETS,
2293,TWELVE SONNETS,"Nay, nay, thy use is here. Stand queenly thus"
2294,TWELVE SONNETS,Till the next fury; teach the time and us
2295,TWELVE SONNETS,Leisure and will to draw a serious breath:
2296,TWELVE SONNETS,"Not wholly where thou art the soul is cowed,"
2297,TWELVE SONNETS,Nor the fooled capital proclaims aloud
2298,TWELVE SONNETS,"Barter is god, while Beauty perisheth."

2309,TWELVE SONNETS,And the wild sounds with wilder odors cope;
2310,TWELVE SONNETS,"Where over crouching sail and coiling rope,"
2311,TWELVE SONNETS,Lascar and Moor along the gangway run;
2312,TWELVE SONNETS,"Where stifled Thames spreads in the pallid sun,"
2313,TWELVE SONNETS,A hive of anarchy from slope to slope;

2320,TWELVE SONNETS,"Sated with human trespass and despair,"
2321,TWELVE SONNETS,"Thee only, from the desert, from the storm,"
2322,TWELVE SONNETS,A sick mind follows into Eden air.
