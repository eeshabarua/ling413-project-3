168,MY INFANCY.,
169,MY INFANCY.,"Full forty years have passed and gone,"
170,MY INFANCY.,"Since early on a winter’s morn,"
171,MY INFANCY.,My infant eyes first struck the light.
172,MY INFANCY.,"At once I showed my baby-spite,"
173,MY INFANCY.,"To find my new abode so plain,"
174,MY INFANCY.,And half resolved I’d not remain.
175,MY INFANCY.,"If I had unexpected come,"
176,MY INFANCY.,"And found this unpretending home,"
177,MY INFANCY.,"I might the negligence excused,"
178,MY INFANCY.,But now I felt I was abused.
179,MY INFANCY.,
180,MY INFANCY.,For half a year the fact was known
181,MY INFANCY.,"That I was on the road to town,"
182,MY INFANCY.,"And all the neighbors, far and near,"
183,MY INFANCY.,"Said, “Doctor’d bring a baby here.”"
184,MY INFANCY.,"And so I came at dawn of day,"
185,MY INFANCY.,"A-crying, too, I’ve heard them say,"
186,MY INFANCY.,And found few preparations made--
187,MY INFANCY.,I’ve often wondered that I stayed.
188,MY INFANCY.,
189,MY INFANCY.,"Plain petticoats and untrimmed slips,"
190,MY INFANCY.,"Pewter spoons that scratched my lips,"
191,MY INFANCY.,"A cradle made of painted pine,"
192,MY INFANCY.,That rocked so rough it made me whine;
193,MY INFANCY.,Then three long hours every day
194,MY INFANCY.,The colic checked my baby play;
195,MY INFANCY.,"For months this griping kept me riled,"
196,MY INFANCY.,And nearly set my mother wild.
197,MY INFANCY.,
198,MY INFANCY.,"At last our troubles seemed to wane,"
199,MY INFANCY.,"I thought I’d bid adieu to pain,"
200,MY INFANCY.,"When teething time, with all its pangs,"
201,MY INFANCY.,Commenced its course with piercing twangs;
202,MY INFANCY.,My mother’d walk the floor by day--
203,MY INFANCY.,"My pa by night, I’ve heard them say."
204,MY INFANCY.,
205,MY INFANCY.,"My father, jolly, good, and kind,"
206,MY INFANCY.,Would often half make up his mind
207,MY INFANCY.,"To slap me soundly if I cried,"
208,MY INFANCY.,"But his heart would fail him when he tried,"
209,MY INFANCY.,And as he tossed and dandled me
210,MY INFANCY.,"In drowsiness upon his knee,"
211,MY INFANCY.,"They say the more he nursed and tried,"
212,MY INFANCY.,"The more I always screamed and cried,"
213,MY INFANCY.,And often would each soul alarm
214,MY INFANCY.,Upon our little one-horse farm.
215,MY INFANCY.,
216,MY INFANCY.,"These trials lasted just a year,"
217,MY INFANCY.,"The coast again seemed getting-clear,"
218,MY INFANCY.,When all at once the whooping-cough
219,MY INFANCY.,Attacked and nearly took me off.
220,MY INFANCY.,"For nine long weeks I whooped and choked,"
221,MY INFANCY.,While mother nursed and father joked--
222,MY INFANCY.,"He was always great to jest and pun,"
223,MY INFANCY.,And turn all troubles into fun--
224,MY INFANCY.,"He said the _crisis_ now was here,"
225,MY INFANCY.,And we had nothing worse to fear.
226,MY INFANCY.,
227,MY INFANCY.,"Alas! his jesting hopes were vain,"
228,MY INFANCY.,"The whooping-cough did not remain,"
229,MY INFANCY.,"But measles next came breaking out,"
230,MY INFANCY.,"The pimples showing, little doubt,"
231,MY INFANCY.,Another siege was mine to bear.
232,MY INFANCY.,"“To all the ills that flesh was heir,”"
233,MY INFANCY.,"I felt my infant lot was given,"
234,MY INFANCY.,And really wished I was in heaven.
235,MY INFANCY.,
236,MY INFANCY.,"But quiet comfort did arrive,"
237,MY INFANCY.,"And I began to grow and thrive,"
238,MY INFANCY.,"And ma and pa could take their rest,"
239,MY INFANCY.,And thought themselves supremely blest.
240,MY INFANCY.,Just then I first began to talk;
241,MY INFANCY.,"At later date, I learned to walk;"
242,MY INFANCY.,"But stammered out my early say,"
243,MY INFANCY.,"And stumbled on my infant way,"
244,MY INFANCY.,"Till one bright morn in early June,"
245,MY INFANCY.,"A baby “brought in a balloon,”"
246,MY INFANCY.,"Unjoints my little Grecian nose,"
247,MY INFANCY.,My infant ire at once arose.
248,MY INFANCY.,
249,MY INFANCY.,"Our family now was much too large,"
250,MY INFANCY.,And then it was a fearful charge
251,MY INFANCY.,"For mother, who had much to do."
252,MY INFANCY.,I’d try to put the baby through.
253,MY INFANCY.,"I’d feel its tiny foot, and sly"
254,MY INFANCY.,"Would pinch or scratch, and make it cry,"
255,MY INFANCY.,"Or rub its head, with look so meek,"
256,MY INFANCY.,And pull its hair or pinch its cheek;
257,MY INFANCY.,And mother would at once begin
258,MY INFANCY.,"To look for the offending pin,"
259,MY INFANCY.,"That made the “baby waby” shriek,"
260,MY INFANCY.,Ne’er dreaming it was Bessie’s freak.
261,MY INFANCY.,
262,MY INFANCY.,"So, at the early age of three,"
263,MY INFANCY.,"Being bad as bad could be,"
264,MY INFANCY.,"I never was a minute mute,"
265,MY INFANCY.,And people thought me smart and cute;
266,MY INFANCY.,"The baby was, I’m glad to say,"
267,MY INFANCY.,More good and quiet in its way--
268,MY INFANCY.,Not half the trouble I had been--
269,MY INFANCY.,"Unless I stuck it with a pin,"
270,MY INFANCY.,"Or rocked it hard, and made it cry,"
271,MY INFANCY.,You scarce would know the babe was by.
272,MY INFANCY.,
273,MY INFANCY.,"So time rolled on, and I intent"
274,MY INFANCY.,"On infant mischief, came and went,"
275,MY INFANCY.,Till little sister learned to talk.
276,MY INFANCY.,’Twas I that taught her first to walk;
277,MY INFANCY.,She’d tumble down--I’d pull her through
278,MY INFANCY.,"And scold her well, and shake her too."
279,MY INFANCY.,"Then she would totter on and cry,"
280,MY INFANCY.,"While I would chase a butterfly,"
281,MY INFANCY.,"And leave her standing in the lane,"
282,MY INFANCY.,A-wondering when I’d come again.
283,MY INFANCY.,
284,MY INFANCY.,"Around the barn we used to roam,"
285,MY INFANCY.,Or any place away from home;
286,MY INFANCY.,"We hand-in-hand would tramp and play,"
287,MY INFANCY.,"From early morn till close of day,"
288,MY INFANCY.,Upsetting all the honest nests
289,MY INFANCY.,"That enterprising hens possessed,"
290,MY INFANCY.,"And loving little ducks to death,"
291,MY INFANCY.,"And out of chickens squeeze the breath,"
292,MY INFANCY.,"Till mother’d come and frown and fuss,"
293,MY INFANCY.,"And father, too, to save a muss."
294,MY INFANCY.,
295,MY INFANCY.,"Then homeward bound you’d see us go,"
296,MY INFANCY.,"The family party in a row,"
297,MY INFANCY.,"But I was nearly always last,"
298,MY INFANCY.,"For when my penitence was past,"
299,MY INFANCY.,"I stopped at times upon the way,"
300,MY INFANCY.,To finish my neglected play;
301,MY INFANCY.,And father laughed and mother’d scold
302,MY INFANCY.,About the black sheep of the fold.
303,MY INFANCY.,
304,MY INFANCY.,"Thus matters stood when I was five,"
305,MY INFANCY.,The hardest little case alive.
306,MY INFANCY.,We spent the hottest summer days
307,MY INFANCY.,"Working hard at baby-plays,"
308,MY INFANCY.,"Making pies of mud and clay,"
309,MY INFANCY.,Hauling sand and dirt away;
310,MY INFANCY.,"Through grass and puddles we would wade,"
311,MY INFANCY.,Till we a hill or ditch had made.
312,MY INFANCY.,"With muddy dresses, tousled hair,"
313,MY INFANCY.,"And dirty faces, we’d repair"
314,MY INFANCY.,"From lane to road, from road to lane,"
315,MY INFANCY.,"Through dirt and dust, through sun and rain."
316,MY INFANCY.,
317,MY INFANCY.,"Our infant lives were passing by,"
318,MY INFANCY.,"When all at once, we scarce knew why,"
319,MY INFANCY.,"A shadow came upon our home,"
320,MY INFANCY.,And all our household filled with gloom.
321,MY INFANCY.,"Our father, ever good and kind,"
322,MY INFANCY.,"Was taken from our midst, to find"
323,MY INFANCY.,"A better home beyond the skies,"
324,MY INFANCY.,"Which lasting happiness supplies,"
325,MY INFANCY.,And mother and five little ones
326,MY INFANCY.,Were left to tread the world alone.
327,MY INFANCY.,
328,MY INFANCY.,But blessings came from every friend
329,MY INFANCY.,That could a kind assistance lend;
330,MY INFANCY.,"Our lot, though lonely, sad, and scant,"
331,MY INFANCY.,Was brightened and relieved from want
332,MY INFANCY.,"For kindred hearts, with willing hand,"
333,MY INFANCY.,Gave shelter to our orphan band.
334,MY INFANCY.,"Our home, of course, must scattered be"
335,MY INFANCY.,To suit the sad emergency.
336,MY INFANCY.,Our little circle’s severed ties
337,MY INFANCY.,"Dimmed my mother’s loving eyes,"
338,MY INFANCY.,But still her grateful heart was glad
339,MY INFANCY.,To know the help and hope we had.
340,MY INFANCY.,
341,MY INFANCY.,"I thought in this extremity,"
342,MY INFANCY.,"There’d be a wondrous rush for me,"
343,MY INFANCY.,"That I’d be claimed by all our kin,"
344,MY INFANCY.,But found myself quite taken in.
345,MY INFANCY.,"My country aunts took all the rest,"
346,MY INFANCY.,"Though, after all, we fared the best."
347,MY INFANCY.,"The oldest boy, my brother Joe,"
348,MY INFANCY.,"Who helped my father plough and hoe,"
349,MY INFANCY.,"Was my especial pet and pride,"
350,MY INFANCY.,"Now, since brother Sam had died."
351,MY INFANCY.,
352,MY INFANCY.,"So, when my city aunt arrived"
353,MY INFANCY.,"To take her pick, at once, I strived"
354,MY INFANCY.,"To be selected as her choice,"
355,MY INFANCY.,"For Joe was pet among the boys,"
356,MY INFANCY.,"And then we could together go,"
357,MY INFANCY.,The city sights each other show.
358,MY INFANCY.,
359,MY INFANCY.,"So, sure enough, our aunty came"
360,MY INFANCY.,"A-riding grandly up the lane,"
361,MY INFANCY.,"And caught me in my dishabille,"
362,MY INFANCY.,Much against my wayward will;
363,MY INFANCY.,"For I had hoped she’d find me clean,"
364,MY INFANCY.,That she might then and there have seen
365,MY INFANCY.,How well I’d look in city guise.
366,MY INFANCY.,Why did she take me by surprise?
367,MY INFANCY.,
368,MY INFANCY.,"The Diamond State was then our home,"
369,MY INFANCY.,"And aunty came from Quakerdom,"
370,MY INFANCY.,"A-looking prim and quite severe,"
371,MY INFANCY.,"But still, I felt I needn’t fear,"
372,MY INFANCY.,For I had much to recommend
373,MY INFANCY.,"My ladyship, you may depend."
374,MY INFANCY.,"I dressed myself with special care,"
375,MY INFANCY.,And put on quite a company air;
376,MY INFANCY.,"And, strutting past my maiden aunt,"
377,MY INFANCY.,I wondered what more she could want;
378,MY INFANCY.,"She put her specs upon her nose,"
379,MY INFANCY.,"And closely scanned my country clothes,"
380,MY INFANCY.,And asked if I was always good;
381,MY INFANCY.,"Never naughty, pert, or rude."
382,MY INFANCY.,"I shunned her kind but searching eye,"
383,MY INFANCY.,"And half resolved, I’d not reply,"
384,MY INFANCY.,"As I had nothing good to tell,"
385,MY INFANCY.,My silence might do just as well.
386,MY INFANCY.,"I thought she’d find out, soon enough,"
387,MY INFANCY.,"My manners were a little rough,"
388,MY INFANCY.,And did not want to disenchant
389,MY INFANCY.,"My new-made friend, and city aunt."
390,MY INFANCY.,
391,MY INFANCY.,"So, looking meek and kind of shy,"
392,MY INFANCY.,"I paused, before I made reply;"
393,MY INFANCY.,"Then told her sometimes I was bad,"
394,MY INFANCY.,But blamed the company that I had;
395,MY INFANCY.,"’Twas never any fault of mine,"
396,MY INFANCY.,"If ever I cut up a shine,"
397,MY INFANCY.,And any mischief that was done
398,MY INFANCY.,Was nearly always just for fun.
399,MY INFANCY.,
400,MY INFANCY.,"So aunty smiled, and hoped I’d be"
401,MY INFANCY.,"A little lady, and she’d see"
402,MY INFANCY.,"If she could take me up to town,"
403,MY INFANCY.,And try to tone my manners down.
404,MY INFANCY.,"I then, at once, desired to know,"
405,MY INFANCY.,"If she couldn’t take my brother, Joe."
406,MY INFANCY.,"She said she rather thought she would,"
407,MY INFANCY.,If both would promise to be good.
408,MY INFANCY.,"So off, in haste, I quickly ran,"
409,MY INFANCY.,"To tell of aunty’s pleasant plan,"
410,MY INFANCY.,"To dream of city’s new delights,"
411,MY INFANCY.,And think of all the wondrous sights
412,MY INFANCY.,That soon would greet our verdant eyes
413,MY INFANCY.,And fill our hearts with glad surprise.
414,MY INFANCY.,"So, then we soon began to pack--"
415,MY INFANCY.,Our outfit most was on our back--
416,MY INFANCY.,"Our trunks and traps were small and few,"
417,MY INFANCY.,"Which, fortunately, aunty knew."
418,MY INFANCY.,
419,MY INFANCY.,"So, on a balmy, summer day,"
420,MY INFANCY.,We all prepared to start away
421,MY INFANCY.,"To leave our home and mother, kind,"
422,MY INFANCY.,And in the world our lot to find;
423,MY INFANCY.,When will life ever seem as bright
424,MY INFANCY.,As that receding from our sight?
425,MY INFANCY.,"So, slowly riding down the lane"
426,MY INFANCY.,"We ne’er could call our own again,"
427,MY INFANCY.,"Poor mother wept in silent woe,"
428,MY INFANCY.,But thought it best for us to go.
429,MY INFANCY.,
430,MY INFANCY.,"So, next you’ll see the orphan pair"
431,MY INFANCY.,In the midst of city’s stifled air;
432,MY INFANCY.,"No fields, no lanes, no trees to climb,"
433,MY INFANCY.,A-wondering how we’d kill the time.
434,MY INFANCY.,"What earthly goods we’d gladly give,"
435,MY INFANCY.,To get back home again to live!
436,MY INFANCY.,"Our aunty, sensible and kind,"
437,MY INFANCY.,"Told us to leave regrets behind,"
438,MY INFANCY.,"And, in her wise and pleasant way,"
439,MY INFANCY.,"Informed us, life was not all play."
440,MY INFANCY.,
441,MY INFANCY.,But childhood’s troubles seldom last
442,MY INFANCY.,Much longer than the cause is past.
443,MY INFANCY.,The city soon began to be
444,MY INFANCY.,A wonder and a joy to me;
445,MY INFANCY.,My aunty got me pretty clothes
446,MY INFANCY.,And taught me how to turn my toes;
447,MY INFANCY.,She’d dress me up so clean and sweet
448,MY INFANCY.,And send me out into the street.
449,MY INFANCY.,I’d miss the “pies” and “puddles” there
450,MY INFANCY.,"And to the gutters I’d repair,"
451,MY INFANCY.,"And play and paddle there in glee,"
452,MY INFANCY.,Till I was summoned in to tea.
453,MY INFANCY.,
454,MY INFANCY.,"My vixen spirit, as of old,"
455,MY INFANCY.,"New mischief daily would unfold,"
456,MY INFANCY.,"And aunty shuddered, as she saw"
457,MY INFANCY.,How little I respected law;
458,MY INFANCY.,"So, wishing me to live by rule,"
459,MY INFANCY.,"She entered me, at once, in school."
460,MY INFANCY.,
461,MY INFANCY.,
462,SCHOOL LIFE.,SCHOOL LIFE.
463,SCHOOL LIFE.,
464,SCHOOL LIFE.,One Monday morn in early Fall
465,SCHOOL LIFE.,"We made the nearest school a call,"
466,SCHOOL LIFE.,To ascertain if they would take
467,SCHOOL LIFE.,A pupil willing to forsake
468,SCHOOL LIFE.,"All mischief and frivolity,"
469,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And strictly stick to A, B, C."
470,SCHOOL LIFE.,
471,SCHOOL LIFE.,The teacher showed a little doubt--
472,SCHOOL LIFE.,She saw how I began to pout;
473,SCHOOL LIFE.,I did not like the busy looks
474,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Of slates and pencils, chalk and books--"
475,SCHOOL LIFE.,I felt I’d much prefer to be
476,SCHOOL LIFE.,"A stranger to my A, B, C."
477,SCHOOL LIFE.,
478,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I knew more now, at any rate,"
479,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Than many children did at eight,"
480,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Then why should I, that was so smart,"
481,SCHOOL LIFE.,Go learning lessons all by heart?
482,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I showed my feelings in my face,"
483,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And aunty, vexed at my disgrace,"
484,SCHOOL LIFE.,At once enrolled my naughty name
485,SCHOOL LIFE.,Upon the future book of fame.
486,SCHOOL LIFE.,
487,SCHOOL LIFE.,I then and there began to climb
488,SCHOOL LIFE.,The hill of science; oh! the time
489,SCHOOL LIFE.,It took to teach me how to do;
490,SCHOOL LIFE.,"But I fought it out, and struggled through."
491,SCHOOL LIFE.,The teacher seldom suited me--
492,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Indeed, we never could agree;"
493,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Her notions always seem so queer,"
494,SCHOOL LIFE.,I wondered why they put her there;
495,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And aunty, too, was odd as she,"
496,SCHOOL LIFE.,Both seemed to be opposed to me.
497,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I felt if ever I grew big,"
498,SCHOOL LIFE.,I’d love to give them both a dig.
499,SCHOOL LIFE.,
500,SCHOOL LIFE.,At times my patience would give out;
501,SCHOOL LIFE.,You couldn’t play a bit without
502,SCHOOL LIFE.,"At once, she’d raise an awful fuss--"
503,SCHOOL LIFE.,A little laugh would make a muss.
504,SCHOOL LIFE.,"You couldn’t talk in any peace,"
505,SCHOOL LIFE.,"But you’d be told at once to cease,"
506,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And look upon your book or slate,"
507,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Or be kept in till awful late,"
508,SCHOOL LIFE.,"You even couldn’t turn around,"
509,SCHOOL LIFE.,No matter what the sight or sound
510,SCHOOL LIFE.,That made you want to look behind--
511,SCHOOL LIFE.,"You might have just as well been blind,"
512,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Or deaf and dumb, for all she cared--"
513,SCHOOL LIFE.,She always kept you kind of scared.
514,SCHOOL LIFE.,
515,SCHOOL LIFE.,"No matter what you had to say,"
516,SCHOOL LIFE.,"She’d surely look another way,"
517,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And talk and teach, and teach and talk;"
518,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Slate and pencil, book and chalk;"
519,SCHOOL LIFE.,Were ever at her finger ends--
520,SCHOOL LIFE.,I wonder she had any friends.
521,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Indeed, she hadn’t many there,"
522,SCHOOL LIFE.,Except the good girls round her chair.
523,SCHOOL LIFE.,They seemed to think her very nice;
524,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I wished they’d taken my advice,"
525,SCHOOL LIFE.,And never mind a word she said;
526,SCHOOL LIFE.,"They soon would found, what motive led"
527,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Her to appear so sweet to them,"
528,SCHOOL LIFE.,And that she wasn’t such a gem.
529,SCHOOL LIFE.,
530,SCHOOL LIFE.,"She had a special spite at me,"
531,SCHOOL LIFE.,The reason why I couldn’t see;
532,SCHOOL LIFE.,"She’d scold me soundly every day,"
533,SCHOOL LIFE.,Whether I would work or play;
534,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And then she’d often keep me in,"
535,SCHOOL LIFE.,"For just a little bit of sin,"
536,SCHOOL LIFE.,That no one else would scarcely see--
537,SCHOOL LIFE.,She was just as mean as mean could be.
538,SCHOOL LIFE.,
539,SCHOOL LIFE.,"If it hadn’t been for family pride,"
540,SCHOOL LIFE.,I think I’d left that school or died;
541,SCHOOL LIFE.,"But aunty thought it best to stay,"
542,SCHOOL LIFE.,And she nearly always had her way.
543,SCHOOL LIFE.,"So there I was for one long year,"
544,SCHOOL LIFE.,And then I left without a tear.
545,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I’d learned to read and write and spell,"
546,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Indeed, they said I studied well."
547,SCHOOL LIFE.,"My failing was behaving bad,"
548,SCHOOL LIFE.,At least that’s what the teacher said;
549,SCHOOL LIFE.,"But she was always saying things,"
550,SCHOOL LIFE.,And telling tales that trouble brings.
551,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I’ve left her class, I’m glad to say--"
552,SCHOOL LIFE.,I’ll try a new one now to-day.
553,SCHOOL LIFE.,
554,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Alas, a-lack-a-day--ah! me,"
555,SCHOOL LIFE.,I fear we too will disagree;
556,SCHOOL LIFE.,"There’s much that’s new I want to know,"
557,SCHOOL LIFE.,And ask the girls if they will show
558,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Exactly how the things are done,"
559,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Besides we want a little fun,"
560,SCHOOL LIFE.,Just to cheer us as we learn--
561,SCHOOL LIFE.,"The teachers are so stiff and stern,"
562,SCHOOL LIFE.,I wouldn’t be one for a farm--
563,SCHOOL LIFE.,They do the children so much harm;
564,SCHOOL LIFE.,Though aunty said to-night at tea
565,SCHOOL LIFE.,That’s what she’s going to make of me.
566,SCHOOL LIFE.,I don’t know what I’ve ever done
567,SCHOOL LIFE.,"To her, indeed to any one,"
568,SCHOOL LIFE.,"That I should suffer such a fate,"
569,SCHOOL LIFE.,Or learn a trade I love to hate.
570,SCHOOL LIFE.,
571,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I tell you what, when I get big,"
572,SCHOOL LIFE.,You’ll see me dance a different jig;
573,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I won’t be sober, staid, and stern,"
574,SCHOOL LIFE.,And try to make the children learn.
575,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Poor little things, I’ll let them be,"
576,SCHOOL LIFE.,Remembering how it was with me.
577,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Just worry, lecture, preach, and scold,"
578,SCHOOL LIFE.,Enough to make a young one old.
579,SCHOOL LIFE.,"At school and home I had no rest,"
580,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Was always getting blamed or blest,"
581,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And mostly too without a cause,"
582,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Just for breaking little laws,"
583,SCHOOL LIFE.,"That never should, by rights, been made,"
584,SCHOOL LIFE.,Nor never would by Bessie’s aid.
585,SCHOOL LIFE.,
586,SCHOOL LIFE.,"So, thus my early life was spent,"
587,SCHOOL LIFE.,From class to class I yearly went;
588,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Each teacher seemed to be my foe,"
589,SCHOOL LIFE.,And quite content to have me go;
590,SCHOOL LIFE.,"But still I had my share of fun,"
591,SCHOOL LIFE.,In spite of all the scolding done.
592,SCHOOL LIFE.,"In tricks and pranks I took delight,"
593,SCHOOL LIFE.,And misbehaved with all my might;
594,SCHOOL LIFE.,"In tact and lessons I excelled,"
595,SCHOOL LIFE.,Or I should long since been expelled.
596,SCHOOL LIFE.,The merits that I got to-day
597,SCHOOL LIFE.,To-morrow’s marks would wipe away.
598,SCHOOL LIFE.,
599,SCHOOL LIFE.,"But, at the end of every term,"
600,SCHOOL LIFE.,Remorse and resolution firm
601,SCHOOL LIFE.,Would fill me with a new desire;
602,SCHOOL LIFE.,But “all the fat was in the fire”
603,SCHOOL LIFE.,"The minute mischief crossed my way,"
604,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Which it, alas! did every day."
605,SCHOOL LIFE.,
606,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Thus school life, with its hopes and fears--"
607,SCHOOL LIFE.,At least the first short seven years--
608,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Was drawing nearly to a close,"
609,SCHOOL LIFE.,"When, all at once, the question rose--"
610,SCHOOL LIFE.,What should next be done with me.
611,SCHOOL LIFE.,"The teachers gladly did agree,"
612,SCHOOL LIFE.,That I should try my luck and leave--
613,SCHOOL LIFE.,The high-school might my name retrieve.
614,SCHOOL LIFE.,"So I studied hard, both night and day,"
615,SCHOOL LIFE.,"(But leisure took for fun and play),"
616,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Till testing time, with questions hard,"
617,SCHOOL LIFE.,Brought me my happy hope’s reward.
618,SCHOOL LIFE.,I did not pass with honors high--
619,SCHOOL LIFE.,I guess you know the reason why;
620,SCHOOL LIFE.,"But still I passed, and was content,"
621,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And to my laurels proudly went,"
622,SCHOOL LIFE.,And talked as big and looked as wise
623,SCHOOL LIFE.,As those that got the highest prize;
624,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And felt it was a happy school,"
625,SCHOOL LIFE.,Possessing such a precious jewel.
626,SCHOOL LIFE.,
627,SCHOOL LIFE.,"So, at the age of green fourteen,"
628,SCHOOL LIFE.,I felt as proud as any queen.
629,SCHOOL LIFE.,"A new leaf I resolved to turn,"
630,SCHOOL LIFE.,And study hard and laurels earn;
631,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I stood quite high for one so young,"
632,SCHOOL LIFE.,And could I only held my tongue
633,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I might have been almost a star,"
634,SCHOOL LIFE.,But mischief would my merits mar;
635,SCHOOL LIFE.,"For what I gained by work and tact,"
636,SCHOOL LIFE.,I’d loose by some rebellious act:
637,SCHOOL LIFE.,I sacrificed myself to fun--
638,SCHOOL LIFE.,My ablest efforts were undone
639,SCHOOL LIFE.,"By some wild freak or fractured rule,"
640,SCHOOL LIFE.,That put me down a dot in school.
641,SCHOOL LIFE.,
642,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I soon began, as heretofore,"
643,SCHOOL LIFE.,"To find the teachers quite a bore,"
644,SCHOOL LIFE.,In interfering all the time--
645,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Indeed it seems a chronic crime,"
646,SCHOOL LIFE.,To be officious and prevent
647,SCHOOL LIFE.,The pleasures that were my intent.
648,SCHOOL LIFE.,They so delight in being dry
649,SCHOOL LIFE.,And dull and stiff. I wonder why?
650,SCHOOL LIFE.,They looked with frowning doubt and dread
651,SCHOOL LIFE.,On every thing I did and said.
652,SCHOOL LIFE.,At times they’d give a sickly smile
653,SCHOOL LIFE.,At my peculiar wayward style;
654,SCHOOL LIFE.,But in a moment they would be
655,SCHOOL LIFE.,A-pointing morals all at me.
656,SCHOOL LIFE.,
657,SCHOOL LIFE.,"As we were taught full forty things,"
658,SCHOOL LIFE.,"With names as long as corset strings,"
659,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And teachers stern and dignified,"
660,SCHOOL LIFE.,I future punishment denied.
661,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I felt we had our troubles here,"
662,SCHOOL LIFE.,And naught to come was aught to fear.
663,SCHOOL LIFE.,
664,SCHOOL LIFE.,Away into the quiet night
665,SCHOOL LIFE.,I’d pore and ponder by the light
666,SCHOOL LIFE.,"That poets call the “midnight oil,”"
667,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Some crooked problem to uncoil,"
668,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Or draw a map, or parse a verse,"
669,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Or write an essay, which was worse,"
670,SCHOOL LIFE.,Or worry with celestial globes--
671,SCHOOL LIFE.,The very thought my bosom probes
672,SCHOOL LIFE.,With recollections full of woe.
673,SCHOOL LIFE.,What good is it for us to know
674,SCHOOL LIFE.,That Mars has belts or Saturn rings--
675,SCHOOL LIFE.,A thousand other different things?
676,SCHOOL LIFE.,"That don’t concern this world at all,"
677,SCHOOL LIFE.,Nor never have since Adam’s fall.
678,SCHOOL LIFE.,
679,SCHOOL LIFE.,Then scanning Milton through and through
680,SCHOOL LIFE.,Is what I did despise to do;
681,SCHOOL LIFE.,Nor did I care a single dime
682,SCHOOL LIFE.,"If all his blank verse had been rhyme,"
683,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Or was awry or wrong in rhythm,"
684,SCHOOL LIFE.,Or had it been with him--in Heaven.
685,SCHOOL LIFE.,That Paradise was lost I knew--
686,SCHOOL LIFE.,I never doubted it was true;
687,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Then why extend the dreary tale,"
688,SCHOOL LIFE.,To worry pupils--maid and male?
689,SCHOOL LIFE.,Mythology and classic lore
690,SCHOOL LIFE.,Is such an everlasting bore.
691,SCHOOL LIFE.,
692,SCHOOL LIFE.,"The other poets we’d dissect,"
693,SCHOOL LIFE.,And try their metre to correct--
694,SCHOOL LIFE.,And murder many of their lays
695,SCHOOL LIFE.,So sadly that it would amaze
696,SCHOOL LIFE.,"The sainted soul, could it but know"
697,SCHOOL LIFE.,The scandalous scanning done below!
698,SCHOOL LIFE.,
699,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Then algebra, with _x_ and _z_,"
700,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Would always vex and puzzle me,"
701,SCHOOL LIFE.,And make me wish that each equation
702,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Was in the sea, with mensuration."
703,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I’d sigh and cipher for an hour,"
704,SCHOOL LIFE.,And long for calculating power
705,SCHOOL LIFE.,"To get the cube root or the square,"
706,SCHOOL LIFE.,Or puzzle out the proper share
707,SCHOOL LIFE.,That A and B would have to get
708,SCHOOL LIFE.,In value either gross or net.
709,SCHOOL LIFE.,
710,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Then hunting rivers, lakes, and bays,"
711,SCHOOL LIFE.,And telling all their different ways
712,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Of rising, flowing, and their end,"
713,SCHOOL LIFE.,Or with what waters they may blend;
714,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And all their lengths and widths and size,"
715,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And what each state or town supplies,"
716,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Of products, imports, exports, ores"
717,SCHOOL LIFE.,That yearly pass its special shores.
718,SCHOOL LIFE.,
719,SCHOOL LIFE.,Ah me! the mountains I would climb
720,SCHOOL LIFE.,"To find the height, and what a time"
721,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I’ve had with longitudes and poles,"
722,SCHOOL LIFE.,Enough to try poor pupils’ souls--
723,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And tropics, latitudes, and zones,"
724,SCHOOL LIFE.,That gave me geographic groans.
725,SCHOOL LIFE.,And then we had to daily tell
726,SCHOOL LIFE.,"The capitals and towns as well,"
727,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Of territories and of states,"
728,SCHOOL LIFE.,And give in full the different dates
729,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Of settlements and civil wars,"
730,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And then we’d have five minutes pause,"
731,SCHOOL LIFE.,Before our history began.
732,SCHOOL LIFE.,Thus our daily duties ran.
733,SCHOOL LIFE.,
734,SCHOOL LIFE.,We never knew an hour’s peace;
735,SCHOOL LIFE.,"For if we weren’t in Rome or Greece,"
736,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Discussing troubles old and stale,"
737,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Some insurrection to bewail,"
738,SCHOOL LIFE.,"We’d have our massacres at home,"
739,SCHOOL LIFE.,"To fill our hearts with bygone gloom,"
740,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Rebellions, riots, rows, and wars,"
741,SCHOOL LIFE.,Breaking all the country’s laws;
742,SCHOOL LIFE.,"But then that was so long ago,"
743,SCHOOL LIFE.,I hardly think we need to know
744,SCHOOL LIFE.,"All those troubles that are past,"
745,SCHOOL LIFE.,It’s bad enough to know the last.
746,SCHOOL LIFE.,
747,SCHOOL LIFE.,And then I think it’s really vile
748,SCHOOL LIFE.,"To take us through the British isle,"
749,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And worry o’er her wars and woes,"
750,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Her usurpations, overthrows,"
751,SCHOOL LIFE.,Her kings and queens both killed and crowned.
752,SCHOOL LIFE.,"We’ll never get a single pound,"
753,SCHOOL LIFE.,"For all our interest in their fate,"
754,SCHOOL LIFE.,No matter how large their estate.
755,SCHOOL LIFE.,
756,SCHOOL LIFE.,I’m tired now of history.
757,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I’ve learned it all, and can not see"
758,SCHOOL LIFE.,Why we have to know so much
759,SCHOOL LIFE.,"About the English, French, and Dutch,"
760,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And all these men of ancient times,"
761,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Their virtue, valor, and their crimes."
762,SCHOOL LIFE.,We have as many of to-day
763,SCHOOL LIFE.,As we can well their traits portray.
764,SCHOOL LIFE.,Then why go back to ages past
765,SCHOOL LIFE.,To get our heroes for a cast?
766,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Or worry o’er the wars of yore,"
767,SCHOOL LIFE.,"When we can have them at our door,"
768,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Green and fresh, of recent date,"
769,SCHOOL LIFE.,"In our own land, indeed our state?"
770,SCHOOL LIFE.,
771,SCHOOL LIFE.,What trials teachers do invent.
772,SCHOOL LIFE.,They never seem to be content
773,SCHOOL LIFE.,Without a torture of some kind
774,SCHOOL LIFE.,To agitate the pupil’s mind.
775,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And as for rest or idle hours,"
776,SCHOOL LIFE.,The very thought their temper sours.
777,SCHOOL LIFE.,"But study early, study late,"
778,SCHOOL LIFE.,Things you like and things you hate;
779,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Study hard and study long,"
780,SCHOOL LIFE.,Whether you are weak or strong.
781,SCHOOL LIFE.,
782,SCHOOL LIFE.,I tried my best to keep my brain
783,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Healthy, sound, and free from pain;"
784,SCHOOL LIFE.,I never had it suffer aught
785,SCHOOL LIFE.,From exercise of weighty thought.
786,SCHOOL LIFE.,"All extra care and overwork,"
787,SCHOOL LIFE.,My great ambition was to shirk;
788,SCHOOL LIFE.,"To save the tissues of my mind,"
789,SCHOOL LIFE.,I’ve always been somewhat inclined!
790,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I’d study just to struggle through,"
791,SCHOOL LIFE.,"But not enough to make me blue,"
792,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Nor any recreation miss,"
793,SCHOOL LIFE.,Which now I think accounts for this
794,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Entire health which is my boast,"
795,SCHOOL LIFE.,That over study might have lost.
796,SCHOOL LIFE.,
797,SCHOOL LIFE.,In moderation thus I went
798,SCHOOL LIFE.,"From grade to grade, and was content."
799,SCHOOL LIFE.,"In tricks and trifling, mirth and fun,"
800,SCHOOL LIFE.,Was always passing number one.
801,SCHOOL LIFE.,"The teachers vexed at every turn,"
802,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And wanting me to leave or learn,"
803,SCHOOL LIFE.,Would often help me gladly through
804,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Their special class into a new,"
805,SCHOOL LIFE.,Thus hoping then and there to find
806,SCHOOL LIFE.,"More occupation for my mind,"
807,SCHOOL LIFE.,And for themselves relief and rest.
808,SCHOOL LIFE.,How little my adieus distressed;
809,SCHOOL LIFE.,For those bereft of such a prize
810,SCHOOL LIFE.,Looked coolly on with driest eyes!
811,SCHOOL LIFE.,
812,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Once or twice I skipped a grade,"
813,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And cast the good girls in the shade,"
814,SCHOOL LIFE.,Thus rid that teacher most entire
815,SCHOOL LIFE.,Of all the mischief I’d inspire;
816,SCHOOL LIFE.,"’Twas less in learning than in luck,"
817,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Together with my tact and pluck,"
818,SCHOOL LIFE.,"That helped me prematurely through,"
819,SCHOOL LIFE.,But that is nothing odd or new.
820,SCHOOL LIFE.,
821,SCHOOL LIFE.,I gushed as much at my advance
822,SCHOOL LIFE.,"As though it was no game of chance,"
823,SCHOOL LIFE.,"And never hinted in the least,"
824,SCHOOL LIFE.,"As honors on me so increased,"
825,SCHOOL LIFE.,’Twas troubled teachers pushing me
826,SCHOOL LIFE.,To get me through thus rapidly.
827,SCHOOL LIFE.,
828,SCHOOL LIFE.,"So thus, for two years and a half--"
829,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I think of it, and have to laugh--"
830,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I spent the chequered, closing days"
831,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Of school life, with its blame and praise,"
832,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Till all at once the president,"
833,SCHOOL LIFE.,"On my departure firmly bent,"
834,SCHOOL LIFE.,Informed me I must now begin
835,SCHOOL LIFE.,My graduating bays to win.
836,SCHOOL LIFE.,"He seemed quite glad to have me leave,"
837,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Indeed, there’s no one seemed to grieve"
838,SCHOOL LIFE.,"About my going at this date,"
839,SCHOOL LIFE.,So I resolved to graduate.
840,SCHOOL LIFE.,
841,SCHOOL LIFE.,"My parting essay now I write,"
842,SCHOOL LIFE.,And try sad feelings to excite.
843,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I use the most pathetic strain,"
844,SCHOOL LIFE.,As though I’d willingly remain
845,SCHOOL LIFE.,To share those sweet scholastic joys
846,SCHOOL LIFE.,That leaving school at once destroys.
847,SCHOOL LIFE.,I tried to make their bosoms sigh
848,SCHOOL LIFE.,For blessings now about to fly.
849,SCHOOL LIFE.,
850,SCHOOL LIFE.,"But, ah! alas, what cool content"
851,SCHOOL LIFE.,My phrases to their faces lent!
852,SCHOOL LIFE.,I sadly spoke of happy scenes
853,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Of school life, with its hopes and dreams,"
854,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Of patient teachers, just and kind,"
855,SCHOOL LIFE.,And wondered if we’d ever find
856,SCHOOL LIFE.,"In life again, such friends as these,"
857,SCHOOL LIFE.,"(And, aside, I thought) as hard to please."
858,SCHOOL LIFE.,
859,SCHOOL LIFE.,I really felt it was a time
860,SCHOOL LIFE.,"When I should utter thoughts sublime,"
861,SCHOOL LIFE.,But no one seemed to be disposed
862,SCHOOL LIFE.,To feel the slightest discomposed;
863,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Nor could I hear a sob or sigh,"
864,SCHOOL LIFE.,Or see a single moistened eye!
865,SCHOOL LIFE.,
866,SCHOOL LIFE.,Each teacher that I left behind
867,SCHOOL LIFE.,Seemed reconciled and well resigned
868,SCHOOL LIFE.,"To hear my valedictory read,"
869,SCHOOL LIFE.,And every parting word I said
870,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Gave pleasure, I could plainly see,"
871,SCHOOL LIFE.,To all the high-school faculty.
872,SCHOOL LIFE.,
873,SCHOOL LIFE.,"That day in June I’ll ne’er forget,"
874,SCHOOL LIFE.,Their happy faces haunt me yet.
875,SCHOOL LIFE.,"So eager, anxious, and content,"
876,SCHOOL LIFE.,"To lose a light, ’twas only lent."
877,SCHOOL LIFE.,"I felt their hearts were made of stone,"
878,SCHOOL LIFE.,To be so glad when I was gone.
879,SCHOOL LIFE.,"Our president, so mild and meek,"
880,SCHOOL LIFE.,"So happy was, he scarce could speak;"
881,SCHOOL LIFE.,"He said my _welfare_ was his aim,"
882,SCHOOL LIFE.,But now my _farewell_ was the same!
883,SCHOOL LIFE.,"So I hurriedly my parchment drew,"
884,SCHOOL LIFE.,And bid the _happy_ school adieu.
885,SCHOOL LIFE.,
886,SCHOOL LIFE.,
887,GIRLHOOD.,GIRLHOOD.
888,GIRLHOOD.,
889,GIRLHOOD.,"Thus I left those hallowed halls,"
890,GIRLHOOD.,"Its blackboards and its pictured walls,"
891,GIRLHOOD.,"With maps and charts of every size,"
892,GIRLHOOD.,To torture brain and tease the eyes;
893,GIRLHOOD.,And fondly fancied I was through;
894,GIRLHOOD.,"I knew twice now what others knew,"
895,GIRLHOOD.,And all I had to do was show
896,GIRLHOOD.,"My talents off, and catch a beau."
897,GIRLHOOD.,
898,GIRLHOOD.,"What consternation then was mine,"
899,GIRLHOOD.,When aunt’s original design
900,GIRLHOOD.,"Was carried out, to have me teach--"
901,GIRLHOOD.,I’d almost rather beg or preach;
902,GIRLHOOD.,"But as it was her great desire,"
903,GIRLHOOD.,"And as I had no wealthy sire,"
904,GIRLHOOD.,My talents must my banker be--
905,GIRLHOOD.,"So I took a class in A, B, C."
906,GIRLHOOD.,
907,GIRLHOOD.,"Again I must divide my time,"
908,GIRLHOOD.,between a share of prose and rhyme;
909,GIRLHOOD.,I taught all day which was my prose--
910,GIRLHOOD.,"The rhyme in evening, was my beau."
911,GIRLHOOD.,"My daily duties never flagged,"
912,GIRLHOOD.,But evening callers often lagged;
913,GIRLHOOD.,I’d wonder too how they could know
914,GIRLHOOD.,My many charms and tarry so!
915,GIRLHOOD.,
916,GIRLHOOD.,"How often evenings I have sat,"
917,GIRLHOOD.,Impromptu welcomes all so pat;
918,GIRLHOOD.,"I’d tell the girl to say “I’m home,”"
919,GIRLHOOD.,Alas the callers never come!
920,GIRLHOOD.,"And I would sit and read a book,"
921,GIRLHOOD.,"I’d read before, and never look"
922,GIRLHOOD.,"Disconcerted or annoyed,"
923,GIRLHOOD.,Till evening hopes were all destroyed.
924,GIRLHOOD.,"Then, disappointed, I’d retire,"
925,GIRLHOOD.,"And try to think of something higher,"
926,GIRLHOOD.,"But bitter pangs would rend my heart,"
927,GIRLHOOD.,And dreams and nightmares make me start.
928,GIRLHOOD.,
929,GIRLHOOD.,"Sometimes a beau would happen in,"
930,GIRLHOOD.,"And make me most commit a sin,"
931,GIRLHOOD.,"By seeming very much surprised,"
932,GIRLHOOD.,When really I had half surmised
933,GIRLHOOD.,That he was coming for a week--
934,GIRLHOOD.,But this was just a girlish freak.
935,GIRLHOOD.,
936,GIRLHOOD.,"They really ought to like to come,"
937,GIRLHOOD.,I made them feel so much at home;
938,GIRLHOOD.,"They seemed so happy while they stayed,"
939,GIRLHOOD.,"And left reluctantly, they said;"
940,GIRLHOOD.,"And I would often think it true,"
941,GIRLHOOD.,And show my sorrow--wouldn’t you?
942,GIRLHOOD.,
943,GIRLHOOD.,"But, ah, alas! I soon began"
944,GIRLHOOD.,To see the sad deceit of man;
945,GIRLHOOD.,"I’d sit and watch and wait in vain,"
946,GIRLHOOD.,"My nose against the window-pane,"
947,GIRLHOOD.,"Or listen with an anxious spell,"
948,GIRLHOOD.,"To hear the ringing of the bell,"
949,GIRLHOOD.,"And bless the beggar that would dare,"
950,GIRLHOOD.,To waken hope and bring despair!
951,GIRLHOOD.,
952,GIRLHOOD.,Thus matters stood at seventeen--
953,GIRLHOOD.,An age that’s always noted been
954,GIRLHOOD.,For sunny happiness and joys--
955,GIRLHOOD.,"And so would mine, but for the boys;"
956,GIRLHOOD.,"The very ones that suited me,"
957,GIRLHOOD.,My aunty never seemed to see
958,GIRLHOOD.,"With loving eyes as I desired,"
959,GIRLHOOD.,And those she liked I ne’er admired;
960,GIRLHOOD.,And when we did on one agree
961,GIRLHOOD.,He hardly ever fancied me!
962,GIRLHOOD.,
963,GIRLHOOD.,"The scrapes and troubles I have had,"
964,GIRLHOOD.,Enough to make a martyr sad;
965,GIRLHOOD.,"These sorrows didn’t happen once,"
966,GIRLHOOD.,But worried me for weeks and months.
967,GIRLHOOD.,"At last becoming better known,"
968,GIRLHOOD.,"New suitors I began to own,"
969,GIRLHOOD.,"And having more, had bitter choice"
970,GIRLHOOD.,And had occasion to rejoice
971,GIRLHOOD.,"That I was blest with lots of beaus,"
972,GIRLHOOD.,But none seemed anxious to propose.
973,GIRLHOOD.,"They’d come and go with thoughtless air,"
974,GIRLHOOD.,"And I, pretending not to care,"
975,GIRLHOOD.,"Would bid them welcome and adieu,"
976,GIRLHOOD.,As sweet and kind as if I knew
977,GIRLHOOD.,Their very heart-throb was for me--
978,GIRLHOOD.,Their lives one line of constancy!
979,GIRLHOOD.,
980,GIRLHOOD.,How many sorry sighs I’ve had
981,GIRLHOOD.,"About a wayward truant lad,"
982,GIRLHOOD.,"How oft “unwisely but too well,”"
983,GIRLHOOD.,"Would love assert its magic spell,"
984,GIRLHOOD.,And hold my heart so tight and strong--
985,GIRLHOOD.,I’m glad it never lasted long!
986,GIRLHOOD.,
987,GIRLHOOD.,"I’ve thought at times I couldn’t live,"
988,GIRLHOOD.,Unless Augustus would forgive
989,GIRLHOOD.,"The little pique I showed last night,"
990,GIRLHOOD.,Done really more in love than spite.
991,GIRLHOOD.,I’ve gone to bed and tried to weep
992,GIRLHOOD.,Myself into a troubled sleep;
993,GIRLHOOD.,"But oft the sorrow I’d forget,"
994,GIRLHOOD.,Before I found my eyes were wet!
995,GIRLHOOD.,"Or Morpheus would my senses blind,"
996,GIRLHOOD.,And leave love’s trials all behind.
997,GIRLHOOD.,
998,GIRLHOOD.,How kind in Nature to prepare
999,GIRLHOOD.,"A heart elastic, that can bear"
1000,GIRLHOOD.,The miseries and weighty woes
1001,GIRLHOOD.,That must attend the age of beaus.
1002,GIRLHOOD.,"For, with so many different kind,"
1003,GIRLHOOD.,"You couldn’t well make up your mind,"
1004,GIRLHOOD.,Especially when you didn’t know
1005,GIRLHOOD.,Which was destined for your beau.
1006,GIRLHOOD.,"To wait and wait, and then to find"
1007,GIRLHOOD.,The wrong one is the one inclined
1008,GIRLHOOD.,"To breathe his hopes into your ears,"
1009,GIRLHOOD.,A nuisance is that seldom cheers.
1010,GIRLHOOD.,
1011,GIRLHOOD.,"Just after such a blow as this,"
1012,GIRLHOOD.,"I thought I saw much future bliss,"
1013,GIRLHOOD.,"In a student of the “nobby” kind,"
1014,GIRLHOOD.,So rich and handsome and refined.
1015,GIRLHOOD.,"But, oh, dear me! my brief delight"
1016,GIRLHOOD.,"Was shattered by his getting tight,"
1017,GIRLHOOD.,And a love of fully thirty days
1018,GIRLHOOD.,Was checked by aunt in many ways.
1019,GIRLHOOD.,I thought at last it might be best
1020,GIRLHOOD.,To let my student lover rest.
1021,GIRLHOOD.,
1022,GIRLHOOD.,"My next, an artist proud and poor,"
1023,GIRLHOOD.,"By chance then living in next door,"
1024,GIRLHOOD.,"Was always at my beck and call,"
1025,GIRLHOOD.,Which aunty didn’t like at all--
1026,GIRLHOOD.,She said he was a fop and dandy.
1027,GIRLHOOD.,"To me he was so nice and handy,"
1028,GIRLHOOD.,"And then so pleasant and polite,"
1029,GIRLHOOD.,We had engagements every night;
1030,GIRLHOOD.,Till all at once my artist beau
1031,GIRLHOOD.,Was told by aunt ’twas best to go--
1032,GIRLHOOD.,The love that lasted three long months
1033,GIRLHOOD.,Was crushed and killed by her at once.
1034,GIRLHOOD.,
1035,GIRLHOOD.,And then I had an interval
1036,GIRLHOOD.,Of several weeks in which to fill
1037,GIRLHOOD.,The place of lovers I had lost--
1038,GIRLHOOD.,"But no one knew the pain it cost,"
1039,GIRLHOOD.,And nothing but a handsome clerk
1040,GIRLHOOD.,"I chanced to meet while at his work,"
1041,GIRLHOOD.,Could make amends for all my woes;
1042,GIRLHOOD.,"But he, alas! did not propose."
1043,GIRLHOOD.,"I think he would, but times were hard,"
1044,GIRLHOOD.,Which often happy hopes retard.
1045,GIRLHOOD.,"I, knowing this, would not allow"
1046,GIRLHOOD.,"Him any chance to make a vow,"
1047,GIRLHOOD.,"For poverty, though not a crime,"
1048,GIRLHOOD.,Has always been a dread of mine.
1049,GIRLHOOD.,"His handsome eyes and wavy hair,"
1050,GIRLHOOD.,Were great temptations I declare;
1051,GIRLHOOD.,And then his love was firm and true
1052,GIRLHOOD.,But he hadn’t cash enough for two.
1053,GIRLHOOD.,"So we sighed in silence o’er our fate,"
1054,GIRLHOOD.,And wisely thought it best to wait--
1055,GIRLHOOD.,"The other callers too seemed slow,"
1056,GIRLHOOD.,I’ve often wondered why ’twas so.
1057,GIRLHOOD.,
1058,GIRLHOOD.,"I had no wealth, or charms to praise;"
1059,GIRLHOOD.,"But, then, I had such “winning ways,”"
1060,GIRLHOOD.,"That ought to take, and may-be will--"
1061,GIRLHOOD.,At least I won’t give up until
1062,GIRLHOOD.,"I hear from some more hopeful source,"
1063,GIRLHOOD.,All true love has a crooked course.
1064,GIRLHOOD.,I know the chap I’d like to catch--
1065,GIRLHOOD.,I think ’twould be a splendid match--
1066,GIRLHOOD.,I wonder what he thinks of me?
1067,GIRLHOOD.,I’ll wait a while and we will see;
1068,GIRLHOOD.,He has a tender sort of way
1069,GIRLHOOD.,When he wishes me to sing or play;
1070,GIRLHOOD.,"And, when the hour comes to leave,"
1071,GIRLHOOD.,He often looks disposed to grieve.
1072,GIRLHOOD.,
1073,GIRLHOOD.,"He’s handsome, too, but awful shy,"
1074,GIRLHOOD.,"Has such a melting, mellow eye,"
1075,GIRLHOOD.,It makes me reconciled to wait
1076,GIRLHOOD.,"If just to see, at any rate,"
1077,GIRLHOOD.,"If time won’t ripen his desire,"
1078,GIRLHOOD.,And sparks of love for me inspire;
1079,GIRLHOOD.,And while I wait he’ll never know
1080,GIRLHOOD.,I ever wished to have a beau.
1081,GIRLHOOD.,
1082,GIRLHOOD.,"Here twice this week, I do declare,"
1083,GIRLHOOD.,And took me out once to the fair;
1084,GIRLHOOD.,"I really think he’s coming round,"
1085,GIRLHOOD.,So I’ll keep cool and hold my ground;
1086,GIRLHOOD.,"Should he propose, I’ll show surprise,"
1087,GIRLHOOD.,"And stammer, No, with drooping eyes:"
1088,GIRLHOOD.,"That’s the way they do in books,"
1089,GIRLHOOD.,Nor show their haste by eager looks;
1090,GIRLHOOD.,"I hope he won’t discover mine,"
1091,GIRLHOOD.,"Nor take in earnest my decline,"
1092,GIRLHOOD.,"It really wasn’t _final_, nay,"
1093,GIRLHOOD.,It only meant a slight delay
1094,GIRLHOOD.,"In making up my maiden mind,"
1095,GIRLHOOD.,"And, in repeating he will find"
1096,GIRLHOOD.,"That after the surprise was o’er,"
1097,GIRLHOOD.,I’d “love and honor and adore.”
1098,GIRLHOOD.,
1099,GIRLHOOD.,"But blessed luck, and happy fate,"
1100,GIRLHOOD.,That didn’t give me long to wait.
1101,GIRLHOOD.,"One quiet eve, in early fall,"
1102,GIRLHOOD.,"He came, and made a lovely call;"
1103,GIRLHOOD.,"No other beaus that night appeared,"
1104,GIRLHOOD.,As both of us at first had feared;
1105,GIRLHOOD.,"And aunty being out of town,"
1106,GIRLHOOD.,We didn’t dread her maiden frown.
1107,GIRLHOOD.,"So being favored thus by fate,"
1108,GIRLHOOD.,His smothered love he did relate.
1109,GIRLHOOD.,Our happiness and new-made bliss
1110,GIRLHOOD.,Was sanctioned by the sealing kiss.
1111,GIRLHOOD.,
1112,GIRLHOOD.,I quite forgot the sighs and looks
1113,GIRLHOOD.,"So recommended in the books,"
1114,GIRLHOOD.,"And answered, Yes, without delay"
1115,GIRLHOOD.,Or looking once another way.
1116,GIRLHOOD.,"He found I wasn’t hard to woo,"
1117,GIRLHOOD.,My answer came so frank and true;
1118,GIRLHOOD.,"For when you’re suited, what’s the sense"
1119,GIRLHOOD.,"Of being kept in such suspense,"
1120,GIRLHOOD.,Till silly rules of etiquette
1121,GIRLHOOD.,Love’s happy longings all upset?
1122,GIRLHOOD.,
1123,GIRLHOOD.,"That evening Cupid’s capers thrived,"
1124,GIRLHOOD.,Till all at once my aunt arrived;
1125,GIRLHOOD.,"I fear we guilty look and feel,"
1126,GIRLHOOD.,Our awkward actions can’t conceal
1127,GIRLHOOD.,"How matters stand, but I will try"
1128,GIRLHOOD.,By tact detection to defy.
1129,GIRLHOOD.,"We treat each other calmly cool,"
1130,GIRLHOOD.,"Talk carelessly of church and school,"
1131,GIRLHOOD.,Or any subject but the one
1132,GIRLHOOD.,That we have just agreed upon.
1133,GIRLHOOD.,"To please my aunty’s prudish ear,"
1134,GIRLHOOD.,"We shunned the theme to us so dear,"
1135,GIRLHOOD.,"Till passing hours in hasty flight,"
1136,GIRLHOOD.,Suggest to us a sad good-night.
1137,GIRLHOOD.,
1138,GIRLHOOD.,Now he is gone--how queer I feel!
1139,GIRLHOOD.,I wish I only dared reveal
1140,GIRLHOOD.,My pent up joy unto my aunt;
1141,GIRLHOOD.,"I want to, but I really can’t."
1142,GIRLHOOD.,She always seemed to like this beau
1143,GIRLHOOD.,"As well as any that I know,"
1144,GIRLHOOD.,But then she never thought that he
1145,GIRLHOOD.,Would ever care a fig for me;
1146,GIRLHOOD.,And now I fear that when she finds
1147,GIRLHOOD.,"He really loves and has designs,"
1148,GIRLHOOD.,She might at once discover flaws
1149,GIRLHOOD.,"To cause her to object or pause,"
1150,GIRLHOOD.,And then what misery would be mine
1151,GIRLHOOD.,No heart could know or tongue define.
1152,GIRLHOOD.,
1153,GIRLHOOD.,The fearful Rubicon is past;
1154,GIRLHOOD.,"I’ve told her all--her sanction asked,"
1155,GIRLHOOD.,"And she consents--most strange to tell,"
1156,GIRLHOOD.,I find my suitor suits her well;
1157,GIRLHOOD.,But wonders what he e’er could see
1158,GIRLHOOD.,In such a wayward girl as me.
1159,GIRLHOOD.,"Indeed, I’ve often wondered too,"
1160,GIRLHOOD.,"Though other people never knew,"
1161,GIRLHOOD.,But what I thought I was a prize;
1162,GIRLHOOD.,Nor did my suitor e’er surmise--
1163,GIRLHOOD.,He thought me all that he desired;
1164,GIRLHOOD.,That trait in him I so admired!
1165,GIRLHOOD.,
1166,GIRLHOOD.,For total blindness in a beau
1167,GIRLHOOD.,Is one the best gifts that I know;
1168,GIRLHOOD.,"So, feeling so secure in this,"
1169,GIRLHOOD.,"We might have lived a life of bliss,"
1170,GIRLHOOD.,"But for a couple other beau,"
1171,GIRLHOOD.,Who thought at once that they’d propose;
1172,GIRLHOOD.,"They never dreamed of it before,"
1173,GIRLHOOD.,Nor would till they had been four score.
1174,GIRLHOOD.,"If I had still kept “fancy free,”"
1175,GIRLHOOD.,They never would have fancied me.
1176,GIRLHOOD.,“It seldom rains but what it pours”--
1177,GIRLHOOD.,Too many beaus are often bores.
1178,GIRLHOOD.,"I cutely kept my matters mum,"
1179,GIRLHOOD.,But found it truly troublesome;
1180,GIRLHOOD.,I told them I was nothing loth
1181,GIRLHOOD.,"To love, indeed to marry, both--"
1182,GIRLHOOD.,"For still on mischief I was bent,"
1183,GIRLHOOD.,And seldom said a word I meant;
1184,GIRLHOOD.,Must ever have my share of fun
1185,GIRLHOOD.,At sad expense of “number one.”
1186,GIRLHOOD.,
1187,GIRLHOOD.,"I really felt, I blush to tell,"
1188,GIRLHOOD.,"That I was getting quite a “belle,”"
1189,GIRLHOOD.,"And could afford to put on airs,"
1190,GIRLHOOD.,When offers tackled me in pairs!
1191,GIRLHOOD.,"And then, too, I had been so fast"
1192,GIRLHOOD.,"In saying yes, that I would blast"
1193,GIRLHOOD.,Those tender hopes I lately made--
1194,GIRLHOOD.,Two lovers cast one in the shade.
1195,GIRLHOOD.,
1196,GIRLHOOD.,"I timed my hours to see them all,"
1197,GIRLHOOD.,"Preventing, thus, a lover’s squall,"
1198,GIRLHOOD.,"And thought my wits were working fine,"
1199,GIRLHOOD.,"When, all at once, that aunt of mine"
1200,GIRLHOOD.,"Commenced, she said, “to smell a rat,”"
1201,GIRLHOOD.,And then we had a lively spat.
1202,GIRLHOOD.,I hardly need to tell the rest--
1203,GIRLHOOD.,For aunty always came out best--
1204,GIRLHOOD.,And I was then obliged to be
1205,GIRLHOOD.,"Content with one, instead of three,"
1206,GIRLHOOD.,"And though I loved the first one well,"
1207,GIRLHOOD.,"I missed the two, I blush to tell."
1208,GIRLHOOD.,"If aunty hadn’t been so queer,"
1209,GIRLHOOD.,"I’d had three lovers all the year,"
1210,GIRLHOOD.,"But now I stuck to number one,"
1211,GIRLHOOD.,And left the other two undone.
1212,GIRLHOOD.,
1213,GIRLHOOD.,"And neither of them seemed to die,"
1214,GIRLHOOD.,I can not tell the reason why;
1215,GIRLHOOD.,"They nearly always do in books,"
1216,GIRLHOOD.,"Or turn out bad, which I think looks"
1217,GIRLHOOD.,More in keeping with their grief.
1218,GIRLHOOD.,I wonder how they got relief?
1219,GIRLHOOD.,"Indeed, I hear they’re living yet,"
1220,GIRLHOOD.,"And doing well, and their regret"
1221,GIRLHOOD.,"Lasted but a little while,"
1222,GIRLHOOD.,And terminated in _a smile_
1223,GIRLHOOD.,That they had missed the happy chance--
1224,GIRLHOOD.,"That wasn’t my fault, but my aunt’s."
1225,GIRLHOOD.,
1226,GIRLHOOD.,But dear devoted number one
1227,GIRLHOOD.,"Forgave the flirting I had done,"
1228,GIRLHOOD.,"And now, as always, I could see"
1229,GIRLHOOD.,How much too good he was for me.
1230,GIRLHOOD.,"At once I thought, with aunty’s aid,"
1231,GIRLHOOD.,"I’d try to settle, and be staid,"
1232,GIRLHOOD.,Becoming worthy of so fine
1233,GIRLHOOD.,And noble-hearted beau as mine.
1234,GIRLHOOD.,
1235,GIRLHOOD.,"How easy ’tis for folks to talk,"
1236,GIRLHOOD.,But oh! how hard to walk the chalk.
1237,GIRLHOOD.,The only hope that I could find
1238,GIRLHOOD.,"Was keeping my beloved blind,"
1239,GIRLHOOD.,"An easy task, I’m glad to say."
1240,GIRLHOOD.,"Till he wanted me to “name the day,”"
1241,GIRLHOOD.,So what’s the use of waiting now
1242,GIRLHOOD.,"For consummation of our vow,"
1243,GIRLHOOD.,When heart and hand and ready will
1244,GIRLHOOD.,Are longing for us to fulfill
1245,GIRLHOOD.,That little form and loving rite
1246,GIRLHOOD.,That permanently hearts unite?
1247,GIRLHOOD.,"So I shall name an early day,"
1248,GIRLHOOD.,"And wed at once, without delay."
1249,GIRLHOOD.,My trousseau won’t be much to get;
1250,GIRLHOOD.,"Indeed, I’m never one to fret"
1251,GIRLHOOD.,"About apparel new and fine,"
1252,GIRLHOOD.,Or try my neighbors to outshine.
1253,GIRLHOOD.,"And then, too, meaning no offense,"
1254,GIRLHOOD.,"To teachers in the abstract sense,"
1255,GIRLHOOD.,Light and slender was my purse.
1256,GIRLHOOD.,"To some, I know, that’s quite a curse;"
1257,GIRLHOOD.,"To me, it being nothing new,"
1258,GIRLHOOD.,My wants were rather small and few.
1259,GIRLHOOD.,
1260,GIRLHOOD.,"My preparations soon were done,"
1261,GIRLHOOD.,Interspersed with lots of fun;
1262,GIRLHOOD.,My wedding day was near at hand
1263,GIRLHOOD.,And I was feeling mighty grand.
1264,GIRLHOOD.,And each of my “five hundred friends”
1265,GIRLHOOD.,"Got tickets, and the fête attends;"
1266,GIRLHOOD.,"I, robed in white, with fleecy veil,"
1267,GIRLHOOD.,"With orange wreath and courtly trail,"
1268,GIRLHOOD.,"Fancied that, at my levee"
1269,GIRLHOOD.,They’d all admire and envy me;
1270,GIRLHOOD.,"But strange to say, I never heard"
1271,GIRLHOOD.,The very first admiring word!
1272,GIRLHOOD.,
1273,GIRLHOOD.,"But then the guests, the gifts, the ring,"
1274,GIRLHOOD.,And all the joys that weddings bring--
1275,GIRLHOOD.,"A sweetish scare, I must confess,"
1276,GIRLHOOD.,Was mingled with my happiness.
1277,GIRLHOOD.,"I could not see the sense of tears,"
1278,GIRLHOOD.,"When I had been, for several years,"
1279,GIRLHOOD.,"Just waiting for this happy day,"
1280,GIRLHOOD.,To give my willing self away;
1281,GIRLHOOD.,"Yet still I trembled as I swore,"
1282,GIRLHOOD.,“To love and honor and adore.”
1283,GIRLHOOD.,
1284,GIRLHOOD.,"My single friends, that disbelieve"
1285,GIRLHOOD.,"My statements, I will give them leave"
1286,GIRLHOOD.,"To marry for themselves, and see"
1287,GIRLHOOD.,How scared and happy they will be;
1288,GIRLHOOD.,My married ones already know
1289,GIRLHOOD.,That what I’ve said is really so.
1290,GIRLHOOD.,
1291,GIRLHOOD.,The altar often ends the tale--

2760,THE MODEL MAN.,So seldom such rarities brighten my way
2761,THE MODEL MAN.,"To the fields of wild fancy I’m driven to stray,"
2762,THE MODEL MAN.,And to paint my ideal in a rhyming array
2763,THE MODEL MAN.,Will force me the muses to coddle.
2764,THE MODEL MAN.,
2765,THE MODEL MAN.,"Well, this model of mine is married, of course,"
2766,THE MODEL MAN.,For how could a bachelor be one?
2767,THE MODEL MAN.,So I gauge him by marital morals and force;
2768,THE MODEL MAN.,"As a husband, he merits a crown for a cross,"
2769,THE MODEL MAN.,For he acts as a beau instead of a boss--
2770,THE MODEL MAN.,I’d go to the moon to see one.
2771,THE MODEL MAN.,
2772,THE MODEL MAN.,"He seldom or never goes out after night,"
2773,THE MODEL MAN.,"As other men do, less devoted."
2774,THE MODEL MAN.,"To lodges and clubs, and to see every sight,"
2775,THE MODEL MAN.,Whether it be wrong or whether it be right;
2776,THE MODEL MAN.,He never comes home either cranky or tight--
2777,THE MODEL MAN.,A fact which should be duly noted.
2778,THE MODEL MAN.,
2779,THE MODEL MAN.,He never comes in from the office and cowls
2780,THE MODEL MAN.,"If dinner is late or not ready,"
2781,THE MODEL MAN.,"Nor frowns nor feazes, nor fusses nor howls,"
2782,THE MODEL MAN.,"Nor goes round the house and grumbles and growls,"
2783,THE MODEL MAN.,"Nor blesses the knife as he cuts up the fowls,"
2784,THE MODEL MAN.,But always seems happy and steady.
2785,THE MODEL MAN.,
2786,THE MODEL MAN.,"He’s a model, indeed--content on a crust."
2787,THE MODEL MAN.,No sighing for honor or riches;
2788,THE MODEL MAN.,He’s as blind as a bat to cob-webs and dust;
2789,THE MODEL MAN.,Nor any domestic derangement or rust
2790,THE MODEL MAN.,"Would he notice for worlds, for fear of a muss--"
2791,THE MODEL MAN.,His thoughtfulness truly bewitches.
2792,THE MODEL MAN.,
2793,THE MODEL MAN.,"A buttonless shirt, or a hole in his hose,"
2794,THE MODEL MAN.,He views with happy contentment.
2795,THE MODEL MAN.,Nor savagely scowls if his best Sunday clothes
2796,THE MODEL MAN.,"Get mussed in the closet; nor blusters nor blows,"
2797,THE MODEL MAN.,Nor curses the rocker for stumping his toes;
2798,THE MODEL MAN.,My model is free from resentment.
2799,THE MODEL MAN.,
2800,THE MODEL MAN.,He never keeps letters for days in his hat
2801,THE MODEL MAN.,"That I give him to mail in the morning,"
2802,THE MODEL MAN.,"But mails them at once, so punctual and pat."
2803,THE MODEL MAN.,"Whether it’s from duty or fear of a spat,"
2804,THE MODEL MAN.,I’m prepared not to say; I only know that
2805,THE MODEL MAN.,He mails them without further warning.
2806,THE MODEL MAN.,
2807,THE MODEL MAN.,"He never complains of long dry goods bills,"
2808,THE MODEL MAN.,Nor squirms when the shoe bill ’s presented;
2809,THE MODEL MAN.,Nor scolds nor scowls when the milliner fills
2810,THE MODEL MAN.,"A long sheet of foolscap with bonnets and frills,"
2811,THE MODEL MAN.,"But pays like a _man_, if it breaks him or kills,"
2812,THE MODEL MAN.,With an air that’s resigned and contented.
2813,THE MODEL MAN.,
2814,THE MODEL MAN.,"And then too, he’s ever so ready to go,"
2815,THE MODEL MAN.,"At the sound of the slightest suggestion,"
2816,THE MODEL MAN.,"To the opera, theater, lecture, or show;"
2817,THE MODEL MAN.,"Consenting at once, he never says no,"
2818,THE MODEL MAN.,"Nor looks bored and cross if it’s stupid or slow,"
2819,THE MODEL MAN.,But retains the same happy expression.
2820,THE MODEL MAN.,
2821,THE MODEL MAN.,"He does not complain, in our travels, of trunks,"
2822,THE MODEL MAN.,"Or baskets, or bundles, or boxes,"
2823,THE MODEL MAN.,But smilingly looks at the over-stored bunks
2824,THE MODEL MAN.,In happy complacence--never worries or spunks;
2825,THE MODEL MAN.,"This model of mine ’s no cross, surly lunks,"
2826,THE MODEL MAN.,But a martyr quite equal to Fox’s.
2827,THE MODEL MAN.,
2828,THE MODEL MAN.,"My ideal man don’t growl for a week,"
2829,THE MODEL MAN.,"Should I get a few duds for my travels,"
2830,THE MODEL MAN.,"But gives money and time, to sew and to seek"
2831,THE MODEL MAN.,"New dresses and wraps, too many to speak,"
2832,THE MODEL MAN.,And seems to enjoy each extravagant freak
2833,THE MODEL MAN.,That the mystery of toilet unravels.
2834,THE MODEL MAN.,
2835,THE MODEL MAN.,Some men will forget in their every-day lives
2836,THE MODEL MAN.,The courtesies due to their spouses;
2837,THE MODEL MAN.,"They get kind of used to their homes and their wives,"
2838,THE MODEL MAN.,"Neglecting the walks, the chats, and the drives,"
2839,THE MODEL MAN.,Upon which connubial happiness thrives;
2840,THE MODEL MAN.,But devotion in mine never drowses.
2841,THE MODEL MAN.,
2842,THE MODEL MAN.,"Now, gents, stop your blushing; I did not intend"
2843,THE MODEL MAN.,To step on the toes of a single male friend.
2844,THE MODEL MAN.,"Your modesty might personalities dread,"
2845,THE MODEL MAN.,So I will say that this model depicted--_is dead_.
