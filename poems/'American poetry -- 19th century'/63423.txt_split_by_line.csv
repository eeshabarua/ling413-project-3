128,A TRIBUTE.,
129,A TRIBUTE.,"More human, more divine than we--"
130,A TRIBUTE.,"In truth, half human, half divine--"
131,A TRIBUTE.,"Is woman, when good stars agree"
132,A TRIBUTE.,To temper with their beams benign
133,A TRIBUTE.,The hour of her nativity.
134,A TRIBUTE.,
135,A TRIBUTE.,"The fairest flower the green earth bears,"
136,A TRIBUTE.,"Bright with the dew and light of heaven,"
137,A TRIBUTE.,"Is, of the double life she wears,"
138,A TRIBUTE.,"The type, in grace and glory given"
139,A TRIBUTE.,By soil and sun in equal shares.
140,A TRIBUTE.,
141,A TRIBUTE.,True sister of the Son of Man:
142,A TRIBUTE.,True sister of the Son of God:
143,A TRIBUTE.,What marvel that she leads the van
144,A TRIBUTE.,"Of those who in the path he trod,"
145,A TRIBUTE.,Still bear the cross and wear the ban?
146,A TRIBUTE.,
147,A TRIBUTE.,"If God be in the sky and sea,"
148,A TRIBUTE.,"And live in light and ride the storm,"
149,A TRIBUTE.,"Then God is God, although He be"
150,A TRIBUTE.,Enshrined within a woman's form;
151,A TRIBUTE.,And claims glad reverence from me.
152,A TRIBUTE.,
153,A TRIBUTE.,"So, as I worship Him in Christ,"
154,A TRIBUTE.,"And in the Forms of Earth and Air,"
155,A TRIBUTE.,"I worship Him imparadised,"
156,A TRIBUTE.,And throned within her bosom fair
157,A TRIBUTE.,Whom vanity hath not enticed.
158,A TRIBUTE.,
159,A TRIBUTE.,O! woman--mother!  Woman--wife!--
160,A TRIBUTE.,The sweetest names that language knows!
161,A TRIBUTE.,"Thy breast, with holy motives rife,"
162,A TRIBUTE.,"With holiest affection glows,"
163,A TRIBUTE.,"Thou queen, thou angel of my life!"
164,A TRIBUTE.,
165,A TRIBUTE.,Noble and fine in his degree
166,A TRIBUTE.,Is the best man my heart receives;
167,A TRIBUTE.,And this my heart's supremest plea
168,A TRIBUTE.,"For him: he feels, acts, lives, believes,"
169,A TRIBUTE.,"And seems, and is, the likest thee."
170,A TRIBUTE.,
171,A TRIBUTE.,O men!  O brothers!  Well I know
172,A TRIBUTE.,That with her nature in our souls
173,A TRIBUTE.,Is born the elemental woe--
174,A TRIBUTE.,"The brutal impulse that controls,"
175,A TRIBUTE.,"And drives, or drags, the godlike low."
176,A TRIBUTE.,
177,A TRIBUTE.,"Ambition, appetite and pride--"
178,A TRIBUTE.,These throng and thrall the hearts of men
179,A TRIBUTE.,"These plat the thorns, and pierce the side"
180,A TRIBUTE.,"Of Him, who, in our souls again,"
181,A TRIBUTE.,"Is spit upon, and crucified."
182,A TRIBUTE.,
183,A TRIBUTE.,"The greed for gain, the thirst for power,"
184,A TRIBUTE.,The lust that blackens while it burns:
185,A TRIBUTE.,Ah! these the whitest souls deflour!
186,A TRIBUTE.,"And one, or all of these by turns,"
187,A TRIBUTE.,Rob man of his divinest dower!
188,A TRIBUTE.,
189,A TRIBUTE.,"Yet man, who shivers like a straw"
190,A TRIBUTE.,"Before Temptation's lightest breeze,"
191,A TRIBUTE.,Assumes the master--gives the law
192,A TRIBUTE.,"To her who, on her bended knees,"
193,A TRIBUTE.,Resists the black-winged thunder-flaw!
194,A TRIBUTE.,
195,A TRIBUTE.,"To him who deems her weak and vain,"
196,A TRIBUTE.,"And boasts his own exceeding might,"
197,A TRIBUTE.,She clings through darkest fortune fain;
198,A TRIBUTE.,Still loyal though the ruffian smite;
199,A TRIBUTE.,"Still true, though crime his hands distain!"
200,A TRIBUTE.,
201,A TRIBUTE.,And is this weakness?  Is it not
202,A TRIBUTE.,"The strength of God, that loves and bears"
203,A TRIBUTE.,Though He be slighted or forgot
204,A TRIBUTE.,"In damning crimes, or driving cares,"
205,A TRIBUTE.,And closest clings in darkest lot?
206,A TRIBUTE.,
207,A TRIBUTE.,Not many friends my life has made;
208,A TRIBUTE.,"Few have I loved, and few are they"
209,A TRIBUTE.,Who in my hand their hearts have laid;
210,A TRIBUTE.,"And these were women.  I am gray,"
211,A TRIBUTE.,But never have I been betrayed.
212,A TRIBUTE.,
213,A TRIBUTE.,These words--this tribute--for the sake
214,A TRIBUTE.,Of truth to God and womankind!
215,A TRIBUTE.,These--that my heart may cease to ache
216,A TRIBUTE.,"With love and gratitude confined,"
217,A TRIBUTE.,And burning from my lips to break!
218,A TRIBUTE.,
219,A TRIBUTE.,These--to that sisterhood of grace
220,A TRIBUTE.,That numbers in its sacred list
221,A TRIBUTE.,"My mother, risen to her place;"
222,A TRIBUTE.,"My wife, but yester-morning kissed,"
223,A TRIBUTE.,And folded in Love's last embrace!
224,A TRIBUTE.,
225,A TRIBUTE.,This tribute of a love profound
226,A TRIBUTE.,"As ever moved the heart of man,"
227,A TRIBUTE.,"To those to whom my life is bound,"
228,A TRIBUTE.,"To her in whom my life began,"
229,A TRIBUTE.,And her whose love my life hath crowned!
230,A TRIBUTE.,
231,A TRIBUTE.,Immortal Love!  Thou still hast wings
232,A TRIBUTE.,"To lift me to those radiant fields,"
233,A TRIBUTE.,"Where Music waits with trembling strings,"
234,A TRIBUTE.,"And Verse her happy numbers yields,"
235,A TRIBUTE.,And all the soul within me sings.
236,A TRIBUTE.,
237,A TRIBUTE.,So from the lovely Pagan dream
238,A TRIBUTE.,I call no more the Tuneful Nine;
239,A TRIBUTE.,For Woman is my Muse Supreme;
240,A TRIBUTE.,"And she with fire and flight divine,"
241,A TRIBUTE.,Shall light and lead me to my theme.

248,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.
249,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
250,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Thou lovely vale of sweetest stream that flows:
251,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Winding and willow-fringed Connecticut!
252,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Swift to thy fairest scenes my fancy flies,"
253,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,As I recall the story of a life
254,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Which there began in years of sinless hope,"
255,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And merged maturely into hopeless sin.
256,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
257,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"O! golden dawning of a day of storms,"
258,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That fell ere noontide into rayless night!
259,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"O! beautiful initial, vermeil-flowered,"
260,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And bright with cherub-eyes and effigies,"
261,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To the black-letter volume of my life!
262,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"O! faÃ«ry gateway, gilt and garlanded,"
263,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And shining in the sun, to gloomy groves"
264,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of shadowy cypress, and to sunless streams,"
265,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Feeding with bane the deadly nightshade's roots,--"
266,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To vexing labyrinths of doubt and fear,"
267,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And deep abysses of despair and death!
268,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Back to thy peaceful villages and fields,"
269,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My memory, like a weary pilgrim, comes"
270,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With scrip and burdon, to repose awhile,--"
271,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To pluck a daisy from a lonely grave
272,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Where long ago, in common sepulture,"
273,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I laid my mother and my faith in God;
274,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To fix the record of a single day
275,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,So memorably wonderful and sweet
276,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Its power of inspiration lingers still,--"
277,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"So full of her dear presence, so divine"
278,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With the melodious breathing of her words,"
279,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And the warm radiance of her loving smile,"
280,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That tears fall readily as April rain
281,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,At its recall; to pass in swift review
282,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The years of adolescence, and the paths"
283,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of glare and gloom through which, by passion led"
284,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I reached the fair possession of my power,"
285,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And won the dear possession of my love,"
286,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And then--farewell!
287,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
288,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Queen-village of the meads
289,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Fronting the sunrise and in beauty throned,"
290,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With jewelled homes around her lifted brow,"
291,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And coronal of ancient forest trees--
292,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Northampton sits, and rules her pleasant realm."
293,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,There where the saintly Edwards heralded
294,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The terrors of the Lord, and men bowed low"
295,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Beneath the menace of his awful words;
296,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And there where Nature, with a thousand tongues"
297,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Tender and true, from vale and mountain-top,"
298,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And smiling streams, and landscapes piled afar,"
299,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Proclaimed a gentler Gospel, I was born."
300,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
301,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In an old home, beneath an older elm--"
302,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"A fount of weeping greenery, that dripped"
303,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Its spray of rain and dew upon the roof--
304,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I opened eyes on life; and now return,"
305,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Among the visions of my early years,"
306,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Two so distinct that all the rest grow dim:
307,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My mother's pale, fond face and tearful eyes,"
308,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Bent upon me in Love's absorbing trance,"
309,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,From the low window where she watched my play;
310,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And, after this, the wondrous elm, that seemed"
311,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To my young fancy like an airy bosk,"
312,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Poised by a single stem upon the earth,"
313,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And thronged by instant marvels.  There in Spring
314,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I heard with joy the cheery blue-bird's note;
315,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,There sang rejoicing robins after rain;
316,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And there within the emerald twilight, which"
317,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Defied the mid-day sun, from bough to bough--"
318,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,A torch of downy flame--the oriole
319,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Passed to his nest, to feed the censer-fires"
320,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Which Love had lit for Airs of Heaven to swing.
321,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"There, too, through all the weird September-eves"
322,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I heard the harsh, reiterant katydids"
323,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Rasp the mysterious silence.  There I watched
324,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The glint of stars, playing at hide-and-seek"
325,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Behind the swaying foliage, till drawn"
326,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,By tender hands to childhood's balmy rest.
327,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My Mother and the elm!  Too soon I learned
328,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That o'er me hung, and o'er the widowed one"
329,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Who gave me birth, with broader boughs,"
330,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Haunted by sabler wings and sadder sounds,"
331,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,A darker shadow than the mighty elm!
332,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I caught the secret in the street from those
333,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Who pointed at me as I passed, or paused"
334,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To gaze in sighing pity on my play;
335,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"From playmates who, forbidden to divulge"
336,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The knowledge they possessed, with childish tricks"
337,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of indirection strove in vain to hide
338,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Their awful meaning in unmeaning phrase;
339,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,From kisses which were pitiful; from words
340,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Gentler than love's because compassionate;
341,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"From deep, unconscious sighs out of the heart"
342,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of her who loved me best, and from her tears"
343,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That freest flowed when I was happiest.
344,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"From frailest filaments of evidence,"
345,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"From dark allusions faintly overheard,"
346,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,From hint and look and sudden change of theme
347,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"When I approached, from widely scattered words"
348,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Remembered well, and gathered all at length"
349,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Into consistent terms, I know not how"
350,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I wrought the full conclusion, nor how young."
351,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I only know that when a little child
352,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I learned, though no one told, that he who gave"
353,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My life to me in madness took his own--
354,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Took it from fear of want, though he possessed"
355,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The finest fortune in the rich old town.
356,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
357,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Thenceforth I had a secret which I kept--
358,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Kept by my mother with as close a tongue--
359,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,A secret which embittered every cup.
360,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"It bred rebellion in me--filled my soul,"
361,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Opening to life in innocent delight,"
362,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With baleful doubt and harrowing distrust.
363,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Why, if my father was the godly man"
364,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"His gentle widow vouched with tender tears,"
365,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Did He to whom she bowed in daily prayer--
366,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Who loved us, as she told me, with a love"
367,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Ineffable for strength and tenderness--
368,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Permit such fate to him, such woe to us?"
369,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Ah! many a time, repeating on my knees"
370,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The simple language of my evening prayer
371,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Which her dear lips had taught me, came the dark"
372,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Perplexing question, stirring in my heart"
373,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"A sense of guilt, or quenching all my faith."
374,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"This, too, I kept a secret.  I had died"
375,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Rather than breathe the question in her ears
376,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Who knelt beside me.  I had rather died
377,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Than add a sorrow to the load she bore.
378,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Taught to be true, I played the hypocrite"
379,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In truthfulness to her.  I had no God,"
380,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Nor penitence, nor loyalty nor love;"
381,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,For any being higher than herself.
382,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Jealous of all to whom she gave her hand,"
383,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I clung to her with fond idolatry.
384,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I sat with her; where'er she walked, I walked"
385,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I kissed away her tears; I strove to fill,"
386,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With strange precocity of manly pride
387,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And more than boyish tenderness, the void"
388,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Which death had made.
389,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
390,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I could not fail to see
391,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That ruth for me and sorrow for her loss--
392,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Twin leeches at her heart--were drinking blood
393,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That, from her pallid features, day by day"
394,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Sank slowly down, to feed the cruel draught."
395,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Nay, more than this I saw, and sadly worse."
396,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Oft when I watched her and she knew it not,"
397,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I marked a quivering horror sweep her face--
398,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"A strange, quick thrill of pain--that brought her hand"
399,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With sudden pressure to her heart, and forced"
400,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To her white lips a swiftly whispered prayer.
401,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I fancied that I read the mystery;
402,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,But it was deeper and more terrible
403,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Than I conjectured.  Not till darker years
404,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Came the solution.
405,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
406,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Still, we had some days"
407,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of pleasure.  Sorrow cannot always brood
408,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Over the shivering forms that drink her warmth;
409,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"But springs to meet the morning light, and soars"
410,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Into the empyrean, to forget"
411,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,For one sweet hour the ring of greedy mouths
412,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That surely wait, and cry for her return."
413,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My mother's hand in mine, or mine in hers,"
414,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"We often left the village far behind,"
415,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And walked the meadow-paths to gather flowers,"
416,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And watch the plowman as he turned the tilth,"
417,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Or tossed his burnished share into the sun
418,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"At the long furrow's end, the while we marked"
419,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The tipsy bobolink, struggling with the chain"
420,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of tinkling music that perplexed his wings,"
421,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And listened to the yellow-breasted lark's
422,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Sweet whistle from the grass.
423,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
424,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Glad in my joy,"
425,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My mother smiled amid these scenes and sounds,"
426,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And wandered on with gentle step and slow,"
427,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"While I, in boyish frolic, ran before,"
428,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Chasing the butterflies, or in her path"
429,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Tossing the gaudy gold of buttercups,"
430,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Till sometimes, ere we knew, we stood entranced"
431,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Upon the river's marge.
432,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
433,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Ever the spell
434,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of lapsing water tamed my playful mood,"
435,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And I reclined in silent happiness
436,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,At the tired feet that rested in the shade.
437,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"There through the long, bright mornings we remained,"
438,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Watching the noisy ferry-boat that plied
439,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Like a slow shuttle through the sunny warp
440,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of threaded silver from a thousand brooks,"
441,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That took new beauty as it wound away;
442,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Or gazing where at Holyoke's verdant base--
443,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Like a slim hound, stretched at his master's feet--"
444,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Lay the long, lazy hamlet, Hockanum;"
445,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Or, upward turning, traced the line that climbed"
446,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,O'er splintered rock and clustered foliage
447,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To the bare mountain-top; then followed down
448,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The scars of fire and storm, or paths of gloom"
449,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That marked the curtained gorges, till, at last,"
450,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Caught by a wisp of white, belated mist,"
451,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Our vision rose to trace its airy flight
452,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Beyond the height, into the distant blue."
453,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
454,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"One morning, while we rested there, she told"
455,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of a dear friend upon the other side--
456,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,A lady who had loved her--whom she loved--
457,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And then she promised to my eager wish
458,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That soon, across the stream I longed to pass,"
459,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I should go with her to the lady's home.
460,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
461,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The wishedfor day came slowly--came at last--
462,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My birthday morning--rounding to their close
463,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The fourteen summers of my boyhood's life.
464,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The early mists were clinging to the side
465,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of the dark mountain as we left the town,"
466,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Though all the roadside fields were quick with toil
467,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In rhythmic motion through the dewy grass
468,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The mowers swept, and on the fragrant air"
469,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Was borne from far the soft, metallic clash"
470,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of stones upon the steel.
471,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
472,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,This was the day
473,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"""So memorably wonderful and sweet"
474,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Its power of inspiration lingers still,--"
475,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"So full of her dear presence, so divine"
476,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With the melodious breathing of her words,"
477,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And the warm radiance of her loving smile,"
478,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That tears fall readily as April rain
479,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"At its recall.""  And with this day there came"
480,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The revelation and the genesis
481,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of a new life.  In intellect and heart
482,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I ceased to be a child, and grew a man."
483,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,By one long leap I passed the hidden bound
484,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That circumscribed my boyhood, and thenceforth"
485,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Abjured all childish pleasure, and took on"
486,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The purpose and the burden of my life.
487,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
488,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"We crossed the river--I, as in a dream;"
489,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And when I stood upon the eastern shore,"
490,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In the full presence of the mountain pile,"
491,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Strange tides of feeling thrilled me, and I wept--"
492,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Wept, though I knew not why.  I could have knelt"
493,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"On the white sand, and prayed.  Within my soul"
494,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Prophetic whispers breathed of coming power
495,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And new possessions.  Aspiration swelled
496,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Like a pent stream within a narrow chasm,"
497,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That finds nor vent nor overflow, but swirls"
498,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And surges and retreats, until it floods"
499,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The springs that feed it.  All was chaos wild,--"
500,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"A chaos of fresh passion, undefined,"
501,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Deep in whose vortices of mist and fire
502,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,A new world waited blindly for its birth.
503,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I had no words for revelation;--none
504,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"For answer, when my mother pressed my hand,"
505,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And questioned why it trembled.  I looked up
506,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With tearful eyes, and met her loving smile,"
507,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And both of us were silent, and passed on."
508,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
509,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,We reached at length the pleasant cottage-home
510,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Where dwelt my mother's friend, and, at the gate,"
511,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Found her with warmest welcome waiting us.
512,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"She kissed my mother's cheek, and then kissed mine,"
513,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Which shrank, and mantled with a new-born shame."
514,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,They crossed the threshold: I remained without.
515,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Surprised--half-angry--with the burning blush
516,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That still o'erwhelmed my face.
517,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
518,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I looked around
519,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"For something to divert my vexing thoughts,"
520,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And saw intently gazing in my eyes,"
521,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"From his long tether in the grass, a lamb--"
522,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"A lusty, downy, handsome, household pet."
523,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,There was a scarlet ribbon on his neck
524,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Which held a silver bell, whose note I heard"
525,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,First when his eye met mine; for then he sprang
526,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To greet me with a joyous bleat, and fell,"
527,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Thrown by the cord that held him.  Pitying him,"
528,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I loosed his cruel leashing, with intent,"
529,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"After a half-hour's frolic, to return"
530,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And fasten as I found him; but my hand,"
531,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Too careless of its charge, slipped from its hold"
532,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With the first bound he made; and with a leap
533,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"He cleared the garden wall, and flew away."
534,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
535,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Affrighted at my deed and its mischance,"
536,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I paused a moment--then with ready feet,"
537,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And first and final impulse, I pursued."
538,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"He held the pathway to the mountain woods,"
539,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The tinkle of his bell already faint
540,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In the long distance he had placed between
541,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Himself and his pursuer.  On and on,"
542,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Climbing the mountain path, he sped away,"
543,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I following swiftly, never losing sight"
544,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of the bright scarlet streaming from his neck,"
545,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Or hearing of the tinkle of his bell,"
546,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Till, wearied both, and panting up the steep,"
547,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Our progress slackened to a walk.
548,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
549,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,At length
550,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"He paused and looked at me, and waited till"
551,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My foot had touched the cord he dragged, and then"
552,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Bounded away, scaling the shelvy cliffs"
553,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That bolder rose along the narrow path.
554,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"He had no choice but mount.  I pressed him close,"
555,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And rocks and chasms were thick on either side;
556,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"So, pausing oft, but ever leaping on"
557,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Before my hand could reach him, he advanced."
558,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Not once in all the passage had I paused
559,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To look below, nor had I thought of her"
560,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Whom I had left.  Absorbed in the pursuit
561,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I pressed it recklessly, until I grasped"
562,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My fleecy prisoner, wound and tied his cord"
563,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Around my wrist, and both of us sank down"
564,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Upon the mountain summit.
565,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
566,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In a swoon
567,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of breathless weariness how long I lay
568,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I could not know; but consciousness at last
569,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Came by my brute companion, who, alert"
570,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Among the scanty browse, tugged at my wrist,"
571,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And brought me startled to my feet.  I saw
572,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In one swift sweep of vision where I stood,--"
573,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In presence of what beauty of the earth,"
574,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"What glory of the sky, what majesty"
575,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of lofty loneliness.  I drew the lamb--
576,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The dear, dumb creature--gently to my side,"
577,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And led him out upon the beetling cliff
578,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That fronts the plaided meadows, and knelt down."
579,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
580,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"When once the shrinking, dizzy spell was gone,"
581,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I saw below me, like a jewelled cup,"
582,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The valley hollowed to its heaven-kissed lip--
583,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The serrate green against the serrate blue--
584,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Brimming with beauty's essence; palpitant
585,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With a divine elixir--lucent floods
586,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Poured from the golden chalice of the sun,"
587,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"At which my spirit drank with conscious growth,"
588,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And drank again with still expanding scope
589,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of comprehension and of faculty.
590,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
591,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I felt the bud of being in me burst
592,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With full, unfolding petals to a rose,"
593,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And fragrant breath that flooded all the scene.
594,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,By sudden insight of myself I knew
595,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That I was greater than the scene,--that deep"
596,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Within my nature was a wondrous world,"
597,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Broader than that I gazed on, and informed"
598,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With a diviner beauty,--that the things"
599,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I saw were but the types of those I held,"
600,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And that above them both, High Priest and King,"
601,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I stood supreme, to choose and to combine,"
602,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And build from that within me and without
603,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"New forms of life, with meaning of my own."
604,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And there alone, upon the mountain-top,"
605,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Kneeling beside the lamb, I bowed my head"
606,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Beneath the chrismal light, and felt my soul"
607,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Baptized and set apart to poetry.
608,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
609,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The spell of inspiration lingered not;
610,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"But ere it passed, I knew my destiny--"
611,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The passion and the portion of my life:
612,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Though, with the new-born consciousness of power"
613,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And organizing and creative skill,"
614,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,There came a sense of poverty--a sense
615,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of power untrained, of skill without resource,"
616,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of ignorance of Nature and her laws
617,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And language and the learning of the schools.
618,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I could not rise upon my callow wings,"
619,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,But felt that I must wait until the years
620,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Should give them plumage, and the skill for flight"
621,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Be won by trial.
622,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
623,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Then before me rose
624,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The long, long years of study, interposed"
625,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Between me and the goal that shone afar;
626,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"But with them rose the courage to surmount,"
627,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And I was girt for toil.
628,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
629,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Then, for the first,"
630,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My eye and spirit that had drunk the whole
631,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Wide vision, grew discriminate, and traced"
632,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The crystal river pouring from the North
633,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Its twinkling tide, and winding down the vale,"
634,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Till, doubling in a serpent coil, it paused"
635,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Before the chasm that parts the frontal spurs
636,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of Tom and Holyoke; then in wreathing light
637,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Sped the swart rocks, and sought the misty South."
638,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Across the meadows--carpet for the gods,"
639,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Woven of ripening rye and greening maize
640,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And rosy clover-blooms, and spotted o'er"
641,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With the black shadows of the feathery elms--
642,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Northampton rose, half hidden in her trees,"
643,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Lifted above the level of the fields,"
644,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And noiseless as a picture.
645,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
646,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,At my feet
647,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The ferry-boat, diminished to a toy,"
648,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With automatic diligence conveyed
649,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Its puppet passengers between the shores
650,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That hemmed its enterprise; and one low barge,"
651,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With white, square sail, bore northward languidly"
652,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The slow and scanty commerce of the stream.
653,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
654,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Eastward, upon another fertile stretch"
655,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of meadow-sward and tilth, embowered in elms,"
656,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Lay the twin streets, and sprang the single spire"
657,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of Hadley, where the hunted regicides"
658,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Securely lived of old, and strangely died;"
659,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And eastward still, upon the last green step"
660,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,From which the Angel of the Morning Light
661,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Leaps to the meadow-lands, fair Amherst sat,"
662,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Capped by her many-windowed colleges;
663,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"While from his outpost in the rising North,"
664,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Bald with the storms and ruddy with the suns
665,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of the long eons, stood old Sugarloaf,"
666,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Gazing with changeless brow upon a scene,"
667,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Changing to fairer beauty evermore.
668,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
669,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Save of the river and my pleasant home,"
670,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I knew not then the names and history
671,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Borne by these visions; but upon my brain
672,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Their forms were graved in lines indelible
673,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"As, on the rocks beneath my feet, the prints"
674,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of life in its first motion.  Later years
675,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Renewed the picture, and its outlines filled"
676,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With fair associations,--wrought the past"
677,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And living present into fadeless wreaths
678,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That crowned each mound and mount, and town and tower,"
679,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The king of teeming memories.  Nor could
680,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I guess with faintest foresight of the life
681,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Which, in the years before me, I should weave"
682,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of mingled threads of pleasure and of pain
683,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Into these scenes, until not one of all"
684,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Could meet my eye, or touch my memory,"
685,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Without recalling an experience
686,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That drank the sweetest ichor of my veins
687,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Or crowded them with joy.
688,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
689,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,At length I turned
690,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"From the wide survey, and with pleased surprise"
691,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Detected, nestling at the mountain's foot,"
692,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The cottage I had left; and, on the lawn,"
693,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Two forms of life that flitted to and fro.
694,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I knew that they had missed me; so I sought
695,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The passage I had climbed, and, with the lamb"
696,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Still fastened to my wrist, I hasted down."
697,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
698,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Full of the marvels of the hour I sped,"
699,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Leaping from rock to rock, or flying swift"
700,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The smoother slopes, with arms half wings, and feet"
701,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That only guarded the descent, the while"
702,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My captive led me captive at his will.
703,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"So tense the strain of sinew, so intense"
704,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The mood and motion, that before I guessed,"
705,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The headlong flight was finished, and I walked,"
706,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Jaded and reeking, in the level path"
707,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That led the lambkin home.
708,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
709,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My mother saw,"
710,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And ran to meet me: then for long, still hours,"
711,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Couched in a dim, cool room, I lay and slept."
712,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"When I awoke, I found her at my side,"
713,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Fanning my face, and ready with her smile"
714,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And soothing words to greet me.  Then I told,"
715,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With youthful volubility and wild
716,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Extravagance of figure and of phrase,"
717,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The morning's exploit.
718,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
719,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,First she questioned me
720,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"But, as I wrought each scene and circumstance"
721,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Into consistent form, she drank my words"
722,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In eager silence; and within her eyes
723,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I saw the glow of pride which gravity
724,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And show of deep concern could not disguise,"
725,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I read her bosom better than she knew.
726,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I saw that she had made discovery
727,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of something unsuspected in her child,"
728,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And that, by one I loved, and she the best,"
729,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The fire that burned within me and the power
730,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That morning called to life, were recognized."
731,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
732,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"When I had told my story, and had read"
733,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With kindling pride my praises in her eyes,"
734,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"She placed her soft hand on my brow, and said:"
735,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"""My Paul has climbed the noblest mountain height"
736,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In all his little world, and gazed on scenes"
737,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,As beautiful as rest beneath the sun.
738,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I trust he will remember all his life
739,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That to his best achievement, and the spot"
740,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Nearest to heaven his youthful feet have trod,"
741,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,He has been guided by a guileless lamb.
742,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,It is an omen which his mother's heart
743,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Will treasure with her jewels."""
744,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
745,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,When the sun
746,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of the long summer day hung but an hour
747,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Above his setting, and the cool West Wind"
748,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Bore from the purpling hills his benison,"
749,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The farewell courtesies of love were given,"
750,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And we set forth for home.
751,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
752,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Not far we fared--
753,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The river left behind--when, looking back,"
754,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I saw the mountain in the searching light
755,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of the low sun.  Surcharged with youthful pride
756,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In my adventure, I can ne'er forget"
757,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The disappointment and chagrin which fell
758,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Upon me; for a change had passed.  The steep
759,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Which in the morning sprang to kiss the sun,"
760,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Had left the scene; and in its place I saw
761,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"A shrunken pile, whose paths my steps had climbed."
762,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Whose proudest height my humble feet had trod.
763,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Its grand impossibilities and all
764,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Its store of marvels and of mysteries
765,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Were flown away, and would not be recalled."
766,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The mountain's might had entered into me;
767,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And, from that fruitful hour, whatever scene"
768,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Nature revealed to me, she never caught"
769,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My spirit humbled by surprise.  My thought
770,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Built higher mountains than I ever found;
771,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Poured wilder cataracts than I ever saw;
772,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Drove grander storms than ever swept the sky;
773,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Pushed into loftier heavens and lower hells
774,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Than the abysmal reach of light and dark;
775,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And entertained me with diviner feasts
776,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Than ever met the appetite of sense,"
777,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And poured me wine of choicer vintages
778,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Than fire the hearts of kings.
779,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
780,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The frolic-flame
781,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Which in the morning kindled in my veins
782,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Had died away; and at my mother's side
783,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I walked in quiet mood, and gravely spoke"
784,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of the great future.  With a tender quest
785,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My mother probed my secret wish, and heard,"
786,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With silence new and strange respectfulness,"
787,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The revelation of my plans.  I felt
788,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In her benign attention to my words;
789,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In her suggestions, clothed with gracious phrase"
790,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To win my judgment; and in all those shades
791,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of mien and manner which a mother's love
792,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Inspires so quickly when the form it nursed
793,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Becomes a staff in its caressing hand,"
794,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"She had made space for me, and placed her life"
795,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In new relations to my own.  I knew
796,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That she who through my span of tender years
797,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Had counselled me, had given me privilege"
798,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Within her councils; and the moment came
799,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I learned that in the converse of that hour,"
800,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The appetency of maternity
801,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"For manhood in its offspring, had laid hold"
802,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of the fresh growth in me, and feasted well"
803,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Its gentle passion.
804,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
805,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Ere we reached our home,"
806,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The plans for study were matured, and I,"
807,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Who, with an aptitude beyond my years,"
808,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Had gathered learning's humbler rudiments
809,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"From her to whom I owed my earliest words,"
810,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Was, when another day should rise, to pass"
811,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To rougher teaching, and society"
812,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of the rude youth whose wild and boisterous ways
813,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Had scared my childish life.
814,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
815,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I nerved my heart
816,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To meet the change; and all the troubled night
817,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I tossed upon my pillow, filled with fears,"
818,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Or fired with hot ambitions; shrinking oft
819,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With girlish sensitiveness from the lot
820,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My manly heart had chosen; rising oft
821,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Above my cowardice, well panoplied"
822,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,By fancy to achieve great victories
823,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,O'er those whose fellows I should be.
824,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
825,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"At last,"
826,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The dawn looked in upon me, and I rose"
827,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To meet its golden coming, and the life"
828,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of golden promise whose wide-open doors
829,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Waited my feet.
830,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
831,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The lingering morning hours
832,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Seemed days of painful waiting, as they fell"
833,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In slowly filling numbers from the tower
834,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of the old village church; but when, at length,"
835,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My eager feet had touched the street, and turned"
836,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To climb the goodly eminence where he
837,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In whose profound and stately pages live
838,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"His country's annals, ruled his youthful realm,"
839,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My heart grew stern and strong; and nevermore
840,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Did doubt of excellence and mastery
841,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Drag down my soaring courage, or disturb"
842,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My purposes and plans.
843,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
844,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,What boots it here
845,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To tell with careful chronicle the life
846,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of my novitiate?  Up the graded months
847,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My feet rose slowly, but with steady step,"
848,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To tall and stalwart manliness of frame,"
849,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And ever rising and expanding reach
850,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of intellection and the power to call
851,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Forth from the pregnant nothingness of words
852,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The sphered creations of my chosen art.
853,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,What boots it to recount my victories
854,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Over my fellows, or to tell how all,"
855,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Contemptuous at first, became at length"
856,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Confessed inferiors in every strife
857,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,When brain or brawn contended?  Victories
858,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Were won too easily to bring me pride,"
859,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And only bred contempt of the low pitch
860,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And lower purpose of the power which strove
861,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"So feebly and so clumsily.  When won,"
862,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"They fed my mother's passion, and she praised;"
863,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And her delight was all the boon they brought.
864,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My fierce ambition, ever reaching up"
865,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To higher fields and nobler combatants,"
866,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Trampled its triumphs underneath its feet;
867,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And in my heart of hearts I pitied her
868,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To whose deep hunger of maternal pride
869,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,They bore ambrosial ministry.
870,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
871,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In all
872,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"These years of doing and development,"
873,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My heart was haunted by a bitter pain.
874,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In every scene of pleasure, every hour"
875,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That lacked employment, every moment's lull"
876,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of toil or study, its familiar hand"
877,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Was raised aloft, to smite me with its pang."
878,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"From month to month, from year to year, I saw"
879,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That she who bore me, and to whom I owed"
880,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The meek and loyal reverence of a child,"
881,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Was changing places with me, and that she--"
882,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Dependent, trustful and subordinate--"
883,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Deferred to me in all things, and in all"
884,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Gave me the parent's place and took the child's.
885,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,She waited for my coming like a child;
886,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,She ran to meet and greet me like a child;
887,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"She leaned on me for guidance and defence,"
888,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And lived in me, and by me, like a child."
889,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"If I were absent long beyond my wont,"
890,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,She yielded to distresses and to tears;
891,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And when I came, she flew into my arms"
892,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With childish impulse of delight, or chid"
893,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With weak complainings my delay.
894,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
895,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"By these,"
896,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And by a thousand other childish ways,"
897,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I knew disease was busy with her life,"
898,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Working distempers in her heart and brain,"
899,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And driving her for succor to my strength.
900,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The change was great in her, though slowly wrought,--"
901,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Though wrought so slowly that my thought and life
902,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Had been adjusted to it, but for this:--"
903,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"One dismal night, a trivial accident"
904,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Had kept me from my home beyond the hour
905,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,At which my promise stood for my return.
906,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Arriving at the garden gate, I paused"
907,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To catch a glimpse of the accustomed light,"
908,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Through the cold mist that wrapped me, but in vain."
909,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Only one window glimmered through the gloom,"
910,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Through whose uncurtained panes I dimly saw
911,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My mother in her chamber.  She was clad
912,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In the white robe of rest; but to and fro
913,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"She crossed the light, sometimes with hands pressed close"
914,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Upon her brow, sometimes raised up toward heaven,"
915,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,As if in deprecation or despair;
916,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And through the strident soughing of the elm
917,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I heard her voice, still musical in woe,"
918,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Wailing and calling.
919,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
920,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With a noiseless step
921,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I reached the door, and, with a noiseless key,"
922,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Turned back the bolt, and stood within.  I could"
923,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Have called her to my arms, and quelled her fears"
924,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"By one dear word, and yet, I spoke it not."
925,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I longed to learn her secret, and to know"
926,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In what recess of history or heart
927,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"It hid, and wrought her awful malady."
928,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
929,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Not long I waited, when I heard her voice"
930,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Wail out again in wild, beseeching prayer,--"
931,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Her voice so sweet and soulful, that it seemed"
932,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,As if a listening fiend could not refuse
933,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Such help as in him lay, although her tongue"
934,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Should falter to articulate her pain.
935,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
936,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I heard her voice--O God!  I heard her words!
937,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Not bolts of burning from the vengeful sky
938,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Had scathed or stunned me more.  I shook like one
939,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Powerless within the toils of some great sin,"
940,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Or some o'ermastering passion; or like one
941,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Whose veins turn ice at onset of the plague.
942,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"""O God,"" she said, ""my Father and my Friend!"
943,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Spare him to me, and save me from myself!"
944,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,O! if thou help me not--if thou forsake--
945,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"This hand which thou hast made, will take the life"
946,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Thou mad'st the hand to feed.  I cling to him,"
947,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My son,--my boy.  If danger come to him,"
948,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,No one is left to save me from this crime.
949,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Thou knowest, O! my God, how I have striven"
950,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To quench the awful impulse; how, in vain,"
951,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My prayers have gone before thee, for release"
952,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,From the foul demon who would drive my soul
953,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To crime that leaves no space for penitence.
954,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,O!  Father!  Father!  Hear me when I call!
955,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Hast thou not made me?  Am I not thy child?
956,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Why, why this mad, mysterious desire"
957,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To follow him I loved, by the dark door"
958,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Through which he forced his passage to the realm
959,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That death throws wide to all?  O why must I,"
960,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"A poor, weak woman--"""
961,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
962,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I could hear no more,"
963,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"But dropped my dripping cloak, and, with a voice,"
964,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Toned to its tenderest cadence, I pronounced"
965,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The sweet word, ""mother!"""
966,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
967,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Her excess of joy
968,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Burst in a cry, and in a moment's space"
969,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I sat within her room, and she, my child,"
970,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Was sobbing in my arms.  I spoke no word,"
971,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,But sat distracted with my tenderness
972,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,For her who threw herself upon my heart
973,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In perfect trust, and bitter thoughts of Him"
974,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Whose succor, though importunately sought"
975,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In piteous pleadings by a gentle saint,"
976,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Was grudgingly withheld.  Her closing words:
977,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"""O why must I, a poor, weak woman--"" rang"
978,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Through every chamber of my tortured soul,"
979,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And called to conclave and rebellion all
980,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The black-browed passions thitherto restrained.
981,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
982,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Ay, why should she, who only sought for God,"
983,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Be given to a devil?  Why should she
984,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Who begged for bread be answered with a stone?
985,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Ay, why should she whose soul recoiled from sin"
986,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"As from a fiend, find in her heart a fiend"
987,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To urge the sin she hated?--questions all
988,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The fiends within me answered as they would.
989,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,O God!  O Father!  How I hated thee!
990,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Nay, how within my angry soul I dared"
991,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To curse thy sacred name!
992,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
993,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Then other thoughts--
994,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Thoughts of myself and of my destiny--
995,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Succeeded.  Who and what was I?  A youth,"
996,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Doomed by hereditary taint to crime,"
997,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,A youth whose every artery and vein
998,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Was doubly charged with suicidal blood.
999,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,When the full consciousness of what I was
1000,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Possessed my thought, and I gazed down the abyss"
1001,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"God had prepared for me, I shrank aghast;"
1002,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And there in silence, with an awful oath"
1003,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I dare not write, I swore my will was mine,"
1004,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And mine my hand; and that, though all the fiends"
1005,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That cumber hell and overrun the earth
1006,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Should spur the deadly impulse of my blood,"
1007,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And heaven withhold the aid I would not ask;
1008,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Though woes unnumbered should beset my life,"
1009,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And reason fall, and uttermost despair"
1010,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Hold me a hopeless prisoner in its glooms,"
1011,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I would resist and conquer, and live out"
1012,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My complement of years.  My bosom burned
1013,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With fierce defiance, and the angry blood"
1014,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Leaped from my heart, and boomed within my brain"
1015,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With throbs that stunned me, though each fiery thrill"
1016,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Was charged with tenderness for her whose head
1017,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Was pillowed on its riot.
1018,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1019,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Long I sat--
1020,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"How long, I know not--but at last the sad,"
1021,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Hysteric sobs and suspirations ceased,"
1022,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Or only at wide intervals recurred;
1023,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And then I rose, and to her waiting bed"
1024,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Led my doomed mother.  With a cheerful voice--
1025,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Cheerful as I could summon--and a kiss,"
1026,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I bade her a good night and pleasant dreams;
1027,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And then, across the hall, I sought my room"
1028,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Where neither sleep nor dream awaited me,"
1029,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"But only blasphemous, black thoughts, and strife"
1030,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With God and Destiny.
1031,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1032,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I saw it all:
1033,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The lamp that from my mother's window beamed,"
1034,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Illumined other nights and other storms,"
1035,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And by its lurid light revealed to me
1036,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The secrets of a life.  Her sudden pangs,"
1037,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Her brooding woes, her terrors when alone,"
1038,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The strange surrender of her will to mine,"
1039,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Her hunger for my presence, and her fear"
1040,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That by some slip of fortune she should lose
1041,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Her hold on me, were followed to their home--"
1042,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To her poor heart, that fluttered every hour"
1043,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With conscious presence of an enemy
1044,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That would not be expelled, and strove to spill"
1045,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The life it spoiled.
1046,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1047,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,From that eventful night
1048,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"She was not left alone.  I called a friend,"
1049,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"A cheerful lady, whose companionship"
1050,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Was music, medicine and rest; and she,"
1051,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Wanting a home, and with a ready wit"
1052,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Learning my mother's need and my desire,"
1053,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Assumed the place of matron in the house;
1054,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And, in return for what we gave to her,"
1055,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Gave us herself.
1056,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1057,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My mother's confidence,"
1058,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"By her self-confidence, she quickly won;"
1059,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And thus, though sadly burdened at my heart,"
1060,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I found one burden lifted from my hands.
1061,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,More liberty of movement and of toil
1062,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I needed; for the time was drawing near
1063,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"When I should turn my feet toward other halls,"
1064,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To seek maturer study, and complete"
1065,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The work of culture faithfully begun.
1066,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1067,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Into my mother's ear I breathed my plans
1068,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With careful words.  The university
1069,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Was but a short remove--a morning's walk--
1070,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Away from her; and ever at her wish--
1071,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Nay, always when I could--I would return;"
1072,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And separation would but sweeten love,"
1073,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And joy of meeting recompense the pain
1074,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of parting and of absence.
1075,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1076,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,She was calm
1077,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And leaning in her thought upon her friend.
1078,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Gave her consent.  So, on a summer day,"
1079,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I kissed her faded cheek, and turned from home"
1080,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To seek the college halls that I had seen
1081,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,From boyhood's mount of vision.
1082,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1083,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of the years
1084,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Passed there in study--of the rivalries,"
1085,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The long, stern struggles for pre-eminence,"
1086,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The triumphs hardly won, but won at last"
1087,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Beyond all cavil, matters not to tell."
1088,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"It was my grief that while I gained and grew,"
1089,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My mother languished momently, and lost,--"
1090,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,A grief that turned to poison in my blood.
1091,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The college prayers were mummeries to me,"
1092,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And with disdainful passion I repelled
1093,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"All Christian questionings of heart and life,"
1094,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,By old and young.
1095,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1096,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I stood, I moved alone."
1097,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I sought no favors, took no courtesies"
1098,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With grateful grace, and nursed my haughty pride."
1099,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The men who kneeled and gloomed, and prayed and sang,"
1100,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Seemed but a brood of dullards, whom contempt"
1101,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Would honor overmuch.  No tender spot
1102,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Was left within my indurated heart,"
1103,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Save that which moved with ever-melting ruth
1104,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"For her whose breast had nursed me, and whose love"
1105,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Had given my life the only happiness
1106,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,It yet had known.
1107,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1108,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With her I kept my pledge
1109,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With more than faithful punctuality.
1110,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Few weeks passed by in all those busy years
1111,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,In which I did not walk the way between
1112,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The college and my home, and bear to her"
1113,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Such consolation as my presence gave.
1114,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In truth, my form was as familiar grown"
1115,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To all the rustic dwellers on the road
1116,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,As I had been a post-boy.
1117,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1118,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Little joy
1119,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,These visits won for me--little beyond
1120,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That which I found in bearing joy to her--
1121,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,For every year marked on her slender frames
1122,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And on her cheeks, and on her failing brain,"
1123,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Its record of decadence.  I could see
1124,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"That she was sinking into helplessness,"
1125,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And that too soon her inoffensive soul,"
1126,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With all its sweet affections, would go down"
1127,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To hopeless wreck and darkness.
1128,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1129,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,From her friend
1130,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I learned that still the burden of her prayer
1131,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Was, that she might be saved from one great sin--"
1132,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The sin of self-destruction.  Every hour
1133,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"This one petition struggled from her heart,"
1134,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To reach the ear of heaven; yet never help
1135,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Came down in answer to her cry.
1136,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1137,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The Spring
1138,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That ushered in my closing college-year
1139,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Came up the valley on her balmy wings,"
1140,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And Winter fled away, and left no trace,"
1141,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Save, here and there a snowy drift, to show"
1142,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Where his cold feet had rested in their flight.
1143,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"But one still night, within the span of sleep,"
1144,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,A shivering winter cloud that wandered late
1145,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Shook to the frosty ground its inch of rime.
1146,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"So, when the morning rose, the earth was white;"
1147,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And shrubs and trees, and roofs and rocks and walls,"
1148,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Fulgent with downy crystals, made a world"
1149,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To which a breath were ruin; and a breath
1150,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Wrecked it for me, and, by a few sad words,"
1151,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Blotted the sunlit splendor from my sight.
1152,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1153,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"As I looked out upon the scene, and mused"
1154,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of her to whom I hoped it might impart
1155,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Some healthy touch of joy, I heard the beat"
1156,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of hoofs upon the trackless blank, and saw"
1157,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,A horseman speeding up the avenue.
1158,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1159,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I raised my sash (I knew he came for me),"
1160,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And faltered forth my question.  From his breast
1161,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"He drew a folded slip: dismounting then,"
1162,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,He stooped and pressed the missive in a mass
1163,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of clinging snow, and tossed it to my hand."
1164,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I closed the window, burst the frosty seal,"
1165,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And read: ""Your mother cannot long survive:"
1166,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Come home to her to-day.""  I did not pause"
1167,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To break the fast of night, but rushing forth,"
1168,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I followed close the messenger's return.
1169,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1170,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"It was a morning, such as comes but once"
1171,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"In all the Spring,--so still and beautiful,"
1172,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"So full of promise, so exhilarant"
1173,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With frost and fire, in earth and air, that life"
1174,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Had been a brimming joy but for the scene
1175,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That waited for my eyes--the scene of death--
1176,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"From which imagination staggered back,"
1177,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And every sensibility recoiled.
1178,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1179,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The smoke from distant sugar-camps rolled up
1180,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Through the still ether in columnar coils--
1181,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Blue pillars of a bluer dome--and all
1182,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The resonant air was full of sounds of Spring.
1183,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The sheep were bleating round their empty ricks;
1184,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Horses let loose were calling from afar,"
1185,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And winning fierce replies; the axeman's blows
1186,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Fell nimbly at the piles which wintry woods
1187,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Had lent to summer stores; while far and faint,"
1188,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The rhythmic ululations of the hound
1189,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"On a fresh trail, upon the mountain's side,"
1190,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Added their strange wild music to the morn.
1191,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1192,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The beauty and the music caught my sense,"
1193,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,But woke within my sick and sinking heart
1194,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,No motion of response.  I walked as one
1195,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Condemned to dungeon-glooms might walk
1196,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Through shouts of mirth and festal pageantry,"
1197,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Hearing and seeing all, yet over all"
1198,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Hearing the clank of chains and clash of bars,"
1199,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And seeing but the reptiles of his cell.
1200,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1201,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"How I arrived at home, without fatigue,"
1202,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Without a thought of effort--onward borne
1203,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,By one absorbing and impelling thought--
1204,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"As one within a minute's mete may slide,"
1205,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"O'er leagues of sunny dreamland in a dream,"
1206,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,By magic or by miracle--I found
1207,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,No time to question.
1208,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1209,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,At my mother's door
1210,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I stood and listened: soon I heard my name
1211,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Pronounced within in spiteful whisperings.
1212,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I raised the latch, and met her burning eyes."
1213,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"She stared a wild, mad stare, then raised herself,"
1214,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And in weak fury poured upon my head
1215,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The vials of her wrath.  I stood like stone,"
1216,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Without the power to speak, the while she rained"
1217,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Her maledictions on me, and in words"
1218,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Fit only for the damned, accused my life"
1219,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of crimes my language could not name, and deeds"
1220,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Which only outcast wretches know.
1221,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1222,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"At length,"
1223,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I gained my tongue, and tried to take her hand;"
1224,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,But with a shriek which cut me like a knife
1225,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"She shrank from me, and hid her quivering face"
1226,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Within her pillow.
1227,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1228,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Then I turned away,"
1229,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And sought the room where oft in better days
1230,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"We both had knelt together at my bed,"
1231,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And, making fast my door, I threw myself"
1232,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Prone on the precious couch, and gave to grief"
1233,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My strong and stormy nature.  All the day
1234,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With bursts of passion I bewailed my loss,"
1235,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Or lay benumbed in feeling and in thought,"
1236,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Tasting no food, and shutting out my soul"
1237,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"From all approach of human sympathy,"
1238,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Till the light waned, and through the leafless boughs"
1239,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of the old elm I caught the sheen of stars.
1240,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Then sleep descended--such a sleep as comes
1241,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"To uttermost exhaustion,--sleep with dreams"
1242,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Wild as the waking fantasies of her
1243,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Whose screams and incoherent words gave voice
1244,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To all their phantom brood.
1245,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1246,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,At length I woke.
1247,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The house was still as death; and yet I heard,"
1248,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Or thought I heard, the touch of crafty feet"
1249,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Upon the carpet, creeping by my door."
1250,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"It passed away, away; and then a pause,"
1251,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Still and presageful as the breathless calm
1252,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"On which the storm-cloud mounts the pallid West,"
1253,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Succeeded.  I could hear the parlor-clock
1254,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Counting the beaded silence, and my bed,"
1255,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Rustling beneath my breathing and my pulse,"
1256,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Was sharply crepitant, and gave me pain."
1257,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1258,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"An hour passed by (it loitered like an age),"
1259,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,And then came hurried words and hasty fall
1260,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of footsteps in the passage.  I could hear
1261,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Screams, sobs, and whispered calls and closing doors"
1262,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And heavy feet that jarred my bed, and shook"
1263,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The windows of my room.  I did not stir:
1264,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I dared not stir, but lay in deathly dread,"
1265,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Waiting the sad denouement.  Soon it came.
1266,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"A man approached my door, and tried the latch;"
1267,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Then knocked, and called.  I knew the kindly voice"
1268,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of the physician, and threw back the bolt."
1269,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Then by the light he held before his face
1270,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I read the fact of death.
1271,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1272,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I took his arm,"
1273,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And, as I feebly staggered down the stairs,"
1274,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,He broke to me with lack of useless words
1275,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The awful truth....  The old familiar tale:
1276,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"She counterfeited sleep: the nurses both,"
1277,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Weary with over-watching in their chairs,"
1278,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Under the cumbrous stillness, slept indeed;"
1279,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And when she knew it, she escaped; and then"
1280,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,She did the deed to which for many years
1281,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,She had been predisposed.  Perhaps I knew
1282,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The nature of the case: perhaps I knew
1283,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,My father went that way.  I clutched his arm:
1284,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,There was no need of words.
1285,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1286,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The parlor door
1287,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Stood open, and a throng of silent friends,"
1288,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Choking with tears, gazed on a silent form"
1289,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Shrouded in snowy linen.  They made way
1290,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,For me and my companion.  On my knees
1291,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"I clasped the precious clay, and pouring forth"
1292,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My pitying love and tenderness for her,"
1293,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I gave indignant voice to my complaint
1294,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Against the Being who, to all her prayers"
1295,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"For succor and security, had turned"
1296,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"A deaf, dead ear and a repelling hand."
1297,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1298,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,To what blaspheming utterance I gave
1299,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"My raving passion, may the God I cursed"
1300,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Forbid my shrinking memory to recall!
1301,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,I now remember only that when drawn
1302,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"By strong, determined hands away from her,"
1303,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The room was vacant.  Every pitying friend
1304,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Had flown my presence and the room, to find"
1305,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Release of sensibility from words
1306,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That roused their superstitious souls to fear
1307,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,That God would smite me through the blinding smoke
1308,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of my great torment.
1309,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1310,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Silence, for the rest!"
1311,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,It was a dream; and only as a dream
1312,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Do I remember it: the coffined form,"
1313,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,The funeral--a concourse of the town--
1314,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The trembling prayer for me, the choking sobs,"
1315,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The long procession, the descending clods,"
1316,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"The slow return, articulated all"
1317,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"With wild, mad words of mine, and gentle speech"
1318,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of those who sought to curb or comfort me--
1319,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"All was a dream, from which I woke at length"
1320,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With heart as dead as hers who slept.  The heavens
1321,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Were brass above me, and the breathing world"
1322,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Was void and meaningless.  When told to pray,"
1323,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,This was the logic of my heart's reply:
1324,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"If God be Love, not such is He to me"
1325,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Nor such to mine.  If He heard not the voice
1326,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Of such a lovely saint as she I mourned,"
1327,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Mine would but rouse His vengeance.
1328,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,
1329,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,So I closed
1330,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,With Reason's hand the adamantine doors
1331,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Which only Faith unlocks, and shut my soul"
1332,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"Away from God, the warder of a gang"
1333,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Of passions that in darkness stormed or gloomed
1334,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,"And with each other fought, or on themselves"
1335,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,Gnawed for the nourishment which I denied.
1336,CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.,

1353,COMPLAINT.,"Though all hapless passions thrill and fill me, you are still the same."
1354,COMPLAINT.,I can borrow for my sorrow nothing that avails
1355,COMPLAINT.,"From your lonely note, that only speaks of joy that never fails."
1356,COMPLAINT.,
1357,COMPLAINT.,O! indifference of Nature to the fact of human pain!
1358,COMPLAINT.,Every grief that seeks relief entreats it at her hand in vain;
1359,COMPLAINT.,"Not a bird speaks forth its passion, not a river seeks the sea,"
1360,COMPLAINT.,Nor a flower from wreaths of Summer breathes in sympathy with me.
1361,COMPLAINT.,
1362,COMPLAINT.,"O! the rigid rock is frigid, though its bed be summer mould,"
1363,COMPLAINT.,And the diamond glitters ever in the grasp of changeless gold;

1373,COMPLAINT.,"That by law of prime relation holds these voices as its own,--"

1375,COMPLAINT.,From the ocean's thundrous rolling to the trolling of the birds.

1391,PART II.,
1392,LOVE.,LOVE.
1393,LOVE.,
1394,LOVE.,"As from a deep, dead sea, by drastic lift"
1395,LOVE.,"Of pent volcanic fires, the dripping form"
1396,LOVE.,"Of a new island swells to meet the air,"
1397,LOVE.,"And, after months of idle basking, feels"
1398,LOVE.,The prickly feet of life from countless germs
1399,LOVE.,"Creeping along its sides, and reaching up"
1400,LOVE.,"In fern and flower to the life-giving sun,"
1401,LOVE.,"So from my grief I rose, and so at length"
1402,LOVE.,I felt new life returning: so I felt
1403,LOVE.,The life already wakened stretching forth
1404,LOVE.,To stronger light and purer atmosphere.
1405,LOVE.,But most I longed for human love--the source
1406,LOVE.,"(So sadly closed), from which my life had drawn"
1407,LOVE.,Its sweetest inspiration and reward.
1408,LOVE.,"I could not pray, nor could my spirit win"
1409,LOVE.,From sights and sounds of nature the response
1410,LOVE.,It vaguely yearned for.  They assailed my sense
1411,LOVE.,With senseless seeming of the hum and whirl
1412,LOVE.,"Of vast machinery, whose motive power"
1413,LOVE.,"Sought its own ends, or wrought for ministry"
1414,LOVE.,To other life than mine.
1415,LOVE.,
1416,LOVE.,"I could stand still,"
1417,LOVE.,And see the trains sweep by; could hear the roar
1418,LOVE.,Of thundering wheels; could watch the pearly plumes
1419,LOVE.,That floated where they flew; could catch a glimpse
1420,LOVE.,Of thousand happy faces at the glass;
1421,LOVE.,But felt that all their freighted life and wealth
1422,LOVE.,"Were nought to me, and moved toward other souls"
1423,LOVE.,In other latitudes.
1424,LOVE.,
1425,LOVE.,"A year had flown,"
1426,LOVE.,"And more, when, on a Sunday morn in June,"
1427,LOVE.,"I wandered out, to wear away the hours"
1428,LOVE.,Of growing restlessness.  The worshippers
1429,LOVE.,"Were thronging to the service of the day,"
1430,LOVE.,"And gave me sidelong stare, or shunned me quite;"
1431,LOVE.,"As if they knew me for a reprobate,"
1432,LOVE.,And feared a taint of death.
1433,LOVE.,
1434,LOVE.,I took the road
1435,LOVE.,"That eastward cleft the town, and sought the bridge"
1436,LOVE.,"That spanned the river, reaching which I crossed."
1437,LOVE.,Then deep within the stripes of springing corn
1438,LOVE.,"I found the shadow of an elm, and lay"
1439,LOVE.,"Stretched on the downy grass for listless hours,"
1440,LOVE.,"Dreaming of days gone by, or turning o'er"
1441,LOVE.,With careless hand the pages of a book
1442,LOVE.,I had brought with me.
1443,LOVE.,
1444,LOVE.,"Tired at length I rose,"
1445,LOVE.,"And, touched by some light impulse, moved along"
1446,LOVE.,"The old, familiar road.  I loitered on"
1447,LOVE.,"In a blind reverie, nor marked the while"
1448,LOVE.,"The furlongs or the time, until the spell"
1449,LOVE.,In a full burst of music was dissolved.
1450,LOVE.,"I startled as one startles from a dream,"
1451,LOVE.,"And saw the church of Hadley, from whose doors,"
1452,LOVE.,"Open to summer air, the choral hymn"
1453,LOVE.,"Poured out its measured tides, and rose and fell"
1454,LOVE.,"Upon the silence in broad cadences,"
1455,LOVE.,"As from a far, careering sea, the waves"
1456,LOVE.,Lift into silver swells the sleeping breasts
1457,LOVE.,Of land-locked bays.
1458,LOVE.,
1459,LOVE.,I heard the sound of flutes
1460,LOVE.,"And hoarse, sonorous viols, in accord"
1461,LOVE.,"With happy human voices,--and one voice--"
1462,LOVE.,A woman's or an angel's--that compelled
1463,LOVE.,"My feet to swift approach.  A thread of gold,"
1464,LOVE.,"Through all the web of sound, I followed it"
1465,LOVE.,"Till, by the stress of some strange sympathy,"
1466,LOVE.,"And by no act of will, I joined my voice"
1467,LOVE.,"To that one voice of melody, and sang."
1468,LOVE.,
1469,LOVE.,"The heart is wiser than the intellect,"
1470,LOVE.,And works with swifter hands and surer feet
1471,LOVE.,"Toward wise conclusions.  So, without resort"
1472,LOVE.,"To reason, in my heart I knew that she"
1473,LOVE.,"Who sang had suffered--knew that she had grieved,"
1474,LOVE.,"Had hungered, struggled, kissed the cheek of death,"
1475,LOVE.,And ranged the scale of passions till her soul
1476,LOVE.,"Was deep, and wide, and soft with sympathy;--"
1477,LOVE.,"Nay, more than this: that she had found at last"
1478,LOVE.,"Peace like a river, on whose waveless tide"
1479,LOVE.,She floated while she sang.  This was the key
1480,LOVE.,"That loosed my prisoned voice, and filled my eyes"
1481,LOVE.,"With tender tears, and touched to life again"
1482,LOVE.,My better nature.
1483,LOVE.,
1484,LOVE.,"When the choral closed,"
1485,LOVE.,"And the last chord in silence lapsed away,"
1486,LOVE.,"I raised my eyes, and, nodding to the beck"
1487,LOVE.,"Of the old, slippered sexton, I went in,--"
1488,LOVE.,Not (shall it be confessed?) to find the God
1489,LOVE.,At whose plain altar bowed the rural throng;
1490,LOVE.,"But, through a voice, to follow to its source"
1491,LOVE.,The influence that moved me.
1492,LOVE.,
1493,LOVE.,I was late;
1494,LOVE.,And many eyes looked up as I advanced
1495,LOVE.,"Through the broad aisle, and took a seat that turned"
1496,LOVE.,My face to all the faces in the house.
1497,LOVE.,"I scanned the simpering girls within the choir,"
1498,LOVE.,But found not what I sought; and then my eyes
1499,LOVE.,"With rambling inquisition swept the pews,"
1500,LOVE.,Pausing at every maiden face in vain.
1501,LOVE.,"One head, that crowned a tall and slender form,"
1502,LOVE.,Was bowed with reverent grace upon the rail
1503,LOVE.,"Before her; and, although I caught no glimpse"
1504,LOVE.,"Of her sweet face, I knew such face was there,"
1505,LOVE.,And there the voice.
1506,LOVE.,
1507,LOVE.,It was Communion Day.
1508,LOVE.,The simple table underneath the desk
1509,LOVE.,"Was draped with linen, on whose snow was spread"
1510,LOVE.,"The feast of love--the vases filled with wine,"
1511,LOVE.,The separated bread and circling cups.
1512,LOVE.,The venerable pastor had come down
1513,LOVE.,"From his high pulpit, and assumed the seat"
1514,LOVE.,"Of presidence, and, with benignant eyes,"
1515,LOVE.,Sat smiling on his flock.  The deacons all
1516,LOVE.,"Rose from their pews--four old, brown-handed men"
1517,LOVE.,With frosty hair--and took the ancient chairs
1518,LOVE.,That flanked the table.  All the house was still
1519,LOVE.,Save here and there the rustle of a silk
1520,LOVE.,Or folding of a fan; and over all
1521,LOVE.,Brooded the dove of peace.  I had no part
1522,LOVE.,"In the fair spectacle, but I could feel"
1523,LOVE.,That it was beautiful and sweet as heaven.
1524,LOVE.,"When the old pastor rose, with solemn mien,"
1525,LOVE.,I looked to see the lady lift her head;
1526,LOVE.,But still she bowed; and then I heard these words;
1527,LOVE.,"""The person who unites with us to-day"
1528,LOVE.,"Will take her place before me in the aisle,"
1529,LOVE.,"To give her answer to our creed, and speak"
1530,LOVE.,"The pledges of our covenant."""
1531,LOVE.,
1532,LOVE.,Then first
1533,LOVE.,"I saw her face.  With modest grace she rose,"
1534,LOVE.,"Lifted her hat, and gave it to the hand"
1535,LOVE.,"Of a companion, and within the aisle"
1536,LOVE.,Stood out alone.  My heart beat thick and fast
1537,LOVE.,"With vision of her perfect loveliness,"
1538,LOVE.,And apprehension of the heroism
1539,LOVE.,"That shone within her eyes, and made her act"
1540,LOVE.,A Christ-like sacrifice.
1541,LOVE.,
1542,LOVE.,O! eyes of blue!
1543,LOVE.,O! lily throat and cheeks of faintest rose!
1544,LOVE.,"O! brow serene, enthroned in holy thought!"
1545,LOVE.,"O! soft, brown sweeps of hair!  O! shapely grace"
1546,LOVE.,"Of maidenhood, enrobed in virgin white!"
1547,LOVE.,"Why, in your rapt unconsciousness of me"
1548,LOVE.,And all around you--in the presence-hall
1549,LOVE.,Of God and angels--at the marriage-feast
1550,LOVE.,Of Jesus and his chosen--did my eyes
1551,LOVE.,Profane the hour with other feast than yours?
1552,LOVE.,
1553,LOVE.,"I heard the ""You Believe"" of the old creed"
1554,LOVE.,Of puritan New England; and I heard
1555,LOVE.,"The old ""You Promise"" of its covenant."
1556,LOVE.,Her bow of reverent assent to all
1557,LOVE.,"The knotty dogmas, and her silent pledge"
1558,LOVE.,"Of faithfulness and fellowship, I saw."
1559,LOVE.,These formularies were the frame of oak--
1560,LOVE.,"Gnarled, strongly carved, and swart with age and use--"
1561,LOVE.,"Which held the lovely picture of my saint,"
1562,LOVE.,And showed her saintliness and beauty well.
1563,LOVE.,
1564,LOVE.,"At close of the recital and response,"
1565,LOVE.,"The pastor raised the plain, baptismal bowl,"
1566,LOVE.,"And she, the maiden devotee, advanced"
1567,LOVE.,And knelt before him.  Lifting then her eyes
1568,LOVE.,"To him and heaven, with look of earnest faith"
1569,LOVE.,"And perfect consecration, she received"
1570,LOVE.,Upon her brow the water from his hand.
1571,LOVE.,"The trickling chrism shone on her cheeks like tears,"
1572,LOVE.,The while he joined her lovely name with God's:

3512,A REFLECTION.,The answer of the herds:
3513,A REFLECTION.,"""Ay, not by bread alone!"""
3514,A REFLECTION.,
3515,A REFLECTION.,Oh! not by bread alone! for life and being

3522,A REFLECTION.,That ever swayed the heart;

3525,A REFLECTION.,"Ay, not by love alone!"
3526,A REFLECTION.,

3546,LABOR.,
3547,LABOR.,"Ten years of love!--a sleep, a pleasant dream"
3548,LABOR.,"That passed its culmen in the early half,"
3549,LABOR.,Concluding in confusion--a wild scene
3550,LABOR.,"Of bargains, auctions, partings, and what not?--"
3551,LABOR.,And an awaking!
3552,LABOR.,
3553,LABOR.,"I was in Broadway,"
3554,LABOR.,A unit in a million.  Like a bath
3555,LABOR.,"In ocean surf, blown in from farthest seas"
3556,LABOR.,"Under the August ardors, the grand rush"
3557,LABOR.,"Of crested life assailed me with its waves,"
3558,LABOR.,And cooled me while it fired.  With sturdy joy
3559,LABOR.,"I sought its broadest billows, and resigned"
3560,LABOR.,My spirit to their surge and sway; or stood
3561,LABOR.,"In sheltered coves, reached only by the spume"
3562,LABOR.,"And crepitant bubbles of the yesty floods,"
3563,LABOR.,"Drinking the roar, the sheen, the restlessness,"
3564,LABOR.,"As inspiration, both of sense and soul."
3565,LABOR.,
3566,LABOR.,I saw the waves of life roll up the steps
3567,LABOR.,Of great cathedrals and retire; and break
3568,LABOR.,In charioted grandeur at the feet
3569,LABOR.,"Of marble palaces, and toss their spray"
3570,LABOR.,"Of feathered beauty through the open doors,"
3571,LABOR.,To pile the restless foam within; and burst
3572,LABOR.,"On crowded caravansaries, to fall"
3573,LABOR.,In quick return; and in dark currents glide
3574,LABOR.,Through sinuous alleys and the grimy loops
3575,LABOR.,Of reeking cellars; and with softest plash
3576,LABOR.,"Assail the gilded shrines of opulence,"
3577,LABOR.,And slide in musical relapse away.
3578,LABOR.,
3579,LABOR.,"With senses dazed and stunned, and soul o'erfilled"
3580,LABOR.,"With chaos of new thoughts, I turned away,"
3581,LABOR.,"And sought my city home.  There all was calm,"
3582,LABOR.,"With wife and daughter waiting my return,"
3583,LABOR.,And eager with their welcome.  That was life!--
3584,LABOR.,"An interest in the great world of life,"
3585,LABOR.,"A place for toil within a world of toil,"
3586,LABOR.,"And love for its reward.  ""Amen!"" I said,"
3587,LABOR.,"""And twice amen!  I've found my life at last,"
3588,LABOR.,"And we will all be happy."""
3589,LABOR.,
3590,LABOR.,Day by day--
3591,LABOR.,The while I sought adjustment to the life
3592,LABOR.,"Which I had chosen, and with careful thought"
3593,LABOR.,Gathered to hand the fair material
3594,LABOR.,Elect by Fancy for the organism
3595,LABOR.,"Over whose germ she brooded--I went out,"
3596,LABOR.,To bathe again upon the shore of life
3597,LABOR.,My long-enfeebled nature.
3598,LABOR.,
3599,LABOR.,Every day
3600,LABOR.,I met some face I knew.  My college friends
3601,LABOR.,"Came up in strange disguises.  Here was one,"
3602,LABOR.,"With a white neck-cloth and a saintly face,"
3603,LABOR.,Who had been rusticated and disgraced
3604,LABOR.,For lawlessness.  Now he administered
3605,LABOR.,"A charge which proved that he had been at work,"
3606,LABOR.,And made himself a man.  And there was one--
3607,LABOR.,"A lumpy sort of boy, as memory"
3608,LABOR.,Recalled him to me--grown to portliness
3609,LABOR.,"And splendid spectacles.  He drove a chaise,"
3610,LABOR.,"And practised surgery,--was on his way"
3611,LABOR.,"To meet a class of youth, who sought to be"
3612,LABOR.,"Great surgeons like himself, and took full notes"
3613,LABOR.,Of all his stolen wisdom.  By his watch--
3614,LABOR.,"A gold repeater, with a mighty chain--"
3615,LABOR.,He gave me just five minutes; then rolled off---
3616,LABOR.,Pretension upon wheels.  Another grasped
3617,LABOR.,"My hand as if I were his bosom friend,"
3618,LABOR.,Just in from a long voyage.  He was one
3619,LABOR.,"Who stole my wood in college, and received"
3620,LABOR.,With grace the kick I gave him.  He had grown
3621,LABOR.,To be the tail of a portentous firm
3622,LABOR.,"Of city lawyers: managed, as he said,"
3623,LABOR.,The matter of collections; and had made
3624,LABOR.,"In his small way--to use his modest phrase,"
3625,LABOR.,Truthful as modest--quite a pretty plum.
3626,LABOR.,He was o'erjoyed to see me in the town:
3627,LABOR.,Hoped I would call upon him at his den:
3628,LABOR.,"If I had any business in his line,"
3629,LABOR.,"Would do it for me promptly; as for price,"
3630,LABOR.,No need to talk of that between two friends!
3631,LABOR.,
3632,LABOR.,"But these, and all--the meanest and the best--"
3633,LABOR.,Were hard at work.  They always questioned me
3634,LABOR.,"Before we parted, touching my pursuits;"
3635,LABOR.,"And though they questioned kindly, I grew sore"
3636,LABOR.,"Under the repetition, and ashamed"
3637,LABOR.,"To iterate my answer, till I burned"
3638,LABOR.,"To do some work, so lifted into fame,"
3639,LABOR.,That shame should be to him whose ignorance
3640,LABOR.,Compelled a question.
3641,LABOR.,
3642,LABOR.,Simplest foresters
3643,LABOR.,"Have learned the trick of woodland broods, that fly"
3644,LABOR.,In radiant divergence from the flash
3645,LABOR.,"Of death and danger, and, when all is still,"
3646,LABOR.,Steal back to where their fellows bit the dust
3647,LABOR.,For rendezvous.  And thus society
3648,LABOR.,"Follows the brutal instinct.  When the friends,"
3649,LABOR.,"Who from her father's ruin fled amain,"
3650,LABOR.,"Found out my wife, and learned that it was safe"
3651,LABOR.,"To gather back to the old feeding-ground,"
3652,LABOR.,They came.  Her old home had become my own
3653,LABOR.,And they were all delighted.  It was sweet
3654,LABOR.,To have her back again; and it was sad
3655,LABOR.,"To know that those who once were happy there,"
3656,LABOR.,"Dispensing happiness, could come no more."
3657,LABOR.,
3658,LABOR.,"It had its modicum of earnestness,--"
3659,LABOR.,This talk of theirs--and she received it all
3660,LABOR.,"With hearty courtesy, and yielded it"
3661,LABOR.,"The unction of her charity, so far"
3662,LABOR.,That it was smooth and redolent to her.
3663,LABOR.,The difference--the world-wide difference--
3664,LABOR.,Between my wife and them was obvious;
3665,LABOR.,But she was generous through nature's gift
3666,LABOR.,I fancied--could not well be otherwise;
3667,LABOR.,Although their fawning filled me with disgust.
3668,LABOR.,Oh! fool and blind! not to perceive the Christ
3669,LABOR.,That shone and spoke in her!
3670,LABOR.,
3671,LABOR.,The hour approached--
3672,LABOR.,The predetermined time--when I should close
3673,LABOR.,"My study door, and wrap my kindling brain"
3674,LABOR.,"In the poetic dream which, day by day,"
3675,LABOR.,Was gathering consistence in my brain.
3676,LABOR.,"The quick, creative instinct in me plumed"
3677,LABOR.,"Its pinions for the flight, and I could feel"
3678,LABOR.,The influx of fresh power; but whence it
3679,LABOR.,I did not question; though it fired my heart
3680,LABOR.,With the assurance of success.
3681,LABOR.,
3682,LABOR.,I told
3683,LABOR.,My dear companion of my hopeful plans
3684,LABOR.,"For winning fame, and making for myself"
3685,LABOR.,A lofty place; but I could not inspire
3686,LABOR.,"Her heart with my ambition, or win o'er"
3687,LABOR.,Her judgment to my motive.  She adhered
3688,LABOR.,"To her old theory, and gave no room"
3689,LABOR.,To any motive it did not embrace.
3690,LABOR.,"We argued much, but always argued wide,"
3691,LABOR.,And ended where we started.  Postulates
3692,LABOR.,"On which we stood in perfect harmony,"
3693,LABOR.,"Were points of separation, out from which"
3694,LABOR.,"We struck divergently, till sympathy,"
3695,LABOR.,"That only lives by rhythm of thoughts and hearts,"
3696,LABOR.,Lay dead between us.
3697,LABOR.,
3698,LABOR.,"""Man loves praise,"" I said."
3699,LABOR.,"""It is an appetence which He who made"
3700,LABOR.,"The human soul, made to be satisfied."
3701,LABOR.,It is a tree He planted.  If it grow
3702,LABOR.,"On that which feeds it, and become at last"
3703,LABOR.,"Thrifty and fruitful, it is still His own,"
3704,LABOR.,"With usury.  And if, in His intent,"
3705,LABOR.,This passion have no place among the powers
3706,LABOR.,"Of active life, why is it mighty there"
3707,LABOR.,From youngest childhood?  Pray you what is fame
3708,LABOR.,But concrete praise?--the universal voice
3709,LABOR.,"Which bears, from every quarter of the earth."
3710,LABOR.,"Its homage to a name, that grows thereby"
3711,LABOR.,To be its own immortal monument
3712,LABOR.,Outlasting all the marble and the bronze
3713,LABOR.,"Which cunning fingers, since the world began,"
3714,LABOR.,Have shaped or stamped with story?  What is fame
3715,LABOR.,But aggregate of praise?  And if it be
3716,LABOR.,"Legitimate to win, for sake of praise,"
3717,LABOR.,"The praise of one, why not of multitudes?"""
3718,LABOR.,
3719,LABOR.,"""Ay,"" she replied; ""'tis true that men love praise"
3720,LABOR.,And it is true that He who made the soul
3721,LABOR.,"Planted therein the love of praise, to be"
3722,LABOR.,A motive in its life--all true so far?
3723,LABOR.,And so far we agree.  But motives all
3724,LABOR.,"Have their appropriate sphere and sway, like men"
3725,LABOR.,Who bear them in their breasts.  The love of praise
3726,LABOR.,Fills life with fine amenities.  Not all
3727,LABOR.,"Who live have pleasant tempers, and not all"
3728,LABOR.,"The gift of gracious manners, or the love"
3729,LABOR.,"Of nobler motive, higher meed than praise."
3730,LABOR.,"The world is full of bears, who smooth their hair,"
3731,LABOR.,"And glove their paws, and put on manly airs,"
3732,LABOR.,"And hold our honey sacred, and our lives"
3733,LABOR.,"Our own, because they hunger for our praise."
3734,LABOR.,'Tis a fine thing for bears--this love of praise--
3735,LABOR.,And those who deal with them; and a good thing
3736,LABOR.,"For children, and for parents, teachers--all"
3737,LABOR.,Who have them in their keeping.  It may hold
3738,LABOR.,"A little mind to rectitude, until"
3739,LABOR.,"It grow, and grow ashamed to yield itself"
3740,LABOR.,To such a petty motive.  Children all
3741,LABOR.,"Like sugar, and it may admit of doubt"
3742,LABOR.,Whether our praise or sugar sweetens more
3743,LABOR.,Their petulant sub-acids; but a man
3744,LABOR.,Would choke in swallowing the compliment
3745,LABOR.,"Which we should pay him, were we but to say"
3746,LABOR.,"'Go to!  Do some great deed, and you shall have"
3747,LABOR.,"Your pay in sugar:--maple, mind you, now,"
3748,LABOR.,"So you shall do it featly.'"""
3749,LABOR.,
3750,LABOR.,"""Very good!"""
3751,LABOR.,"I answered, ""very good, indeed! if we"
3752,LABOR.,Engage in talk for sport; but argument
3753,LABOR.,On themes like these must have the element
3754,LABOR.,"Of candor.  Highest truth, in certain lights,"
3755,LABOR.,"May be ridiculous, and yet be truth."
3756,LABOR.,Women are angels: just a little weak
3757,LABOR.,"And just a little wicked, it may be,"
3758,LABOR.,Yet still the sweetest beings in the world;
3759,LABOR.,But when one stands with apprehensive gasp
3760,LABOR.,"At verge of sternutation, or leaps off,"
3761,LABOR.,"Projecting all her being in a sneeze,"
3762,LABOR.,"Or snores with lips wide-parted, or essays"
3763,LABOR.,"The 'double-quick,' we turn our eyes away"
3764,LABOR.,"In sadness, that a creature so divine"
3765,LABOR.,Can be so shockingly ridiculous;
3766,LABOR.,Yet who shall say she's not an angel still?
3767,LABOR.,Now you present to me the meanest face
3768,LABOR.,Of a most noble truth.  I laugh with you
3769,LABOR.,Over its sorry semblance; but the truth
3770,LABOR.,"Is still divine, and claims our reverence."
3771,LABOR.,The great King Solomon--and you believe
3772,LABOR.,In Solomon--has said that a good name
3773,LABOR.,Is more to be desired than much fine gold.
3774,LABOR.,If a good name be matter of desire
3775,LABOR.,Beyond all wealth--and you will pardon me
3776,LABOR.,For holding to the record--it may stand
3777,LABOR.,"As a grand motive in the life of man,"
3778,LABOR.,To grand endeavor.  I have yet to learn
3779,LABOR.,"That Solomon addressed his words to bears,"
3780,LABOR.,Or little children.  I am forced to think
3781,LABOR.,"That you and I, and all who read his words,"
3782,LABOR.,"Are those for whom he wrote."""
3783,LABOR.,
3784,LABOR.,Rejoining she:
3785,LABOR.,"""A good may be the subject of desire,"
3786,LABOR.,"And not be motive to achievement.  Life,"
3787,LABOR.,"If I may speak the riddle, is a scheme"
3788,LABOR.,Of indirections.  My own happiness
3789,LABOR.,"Is something to desire; and yet, I know"
3790,LABOR.,That I must win it by forgetting it
3791,LABOR.,In ministry to others.  If I make
3792,LABOR.,"My happiness the motive of my work,"
3793,LABOR.,I spoil it by the taint of selfishness.
3794,LABOR.,But are you sure that you do not presume
3795,LABOR.,"Somewhat too much, in claiming the desire"
3796,LABOR.,For a good name as motive of your life?
3797,LABOR.,"Greatness, not goodness, is the end you seek,"
3798,LABOR.,"If I mistake you not; and these are held,"
3799,LABOR.,"In the world's thought, as two, and most distinct."
3800,LABOR.,"King Solomon was wise, but wiser He"
3801,LABOR.,"Who said to those who loved and followed him,"
3802,LABOR.,"'Who would be great among you, let him serve.'"
3803,LABOR.,"The greatest men and artists should be such,"
3804,LABOR.,For they are God's nobility and man's
3805,LABOR.,Should work from greatest motives.  Selfishness
3806,LABOR.,"Is never great, and moves to no great deeds."
3807,LABOR.,"To honor God, to benefit mankind,"
3808,LABOR.,To serve with lofty gifts the lowly needs
3809,LABOR.,"Of the poor race for which the God-man died,"
3810,LABOR.,And do it all for love--oh! this is great!
3811,LABOR.,And he who does this will achieve a name
3812,LABOR.,"Not only great but good."""
3813,LABOR.,
3814,LABOR.,"""Not in this world,"""
3815,LABOR.,"I answered her.  ""I know too much of it."
3816,LABOR.,The world is selfish; and it never gives
3817,LABOR.,Due credit to a motive which assumes
3818,LABOR.,"To be above its own.  If a man write,"
3819,LABOR.,"It takes for granted that he writes for fame,"
3820,LABOR.,And judges him accordingly.  It holds
3821,LABOR.,Of no account all other aims and ends;
3822,LABOR.,And visits with contempt the man who bears
3823,LABOR.,A mission to his kind.  The critic pens
3824,LABOR.,"That twiddle with his work, or play with it"
3825,LABOR.,"As cats with mice, are not remarkable"
3826,LABOR.,For gentle instincts; and my name must live
3827,LABOR.,By pens like these.  I choose to take the world
3828,LABOR.,"Just as I find it, and I pitch my tune"
3829,LABOR.,"To the world's key, that it may sing my tune."
3830,LABOR.,"And sing for me.  Ay, and I take myself"
3831,LABOR.,Just as I find myself.  I do not love
3832,LABOR.,The human race enough to work for it.
3833,LABOR.,"Having no motive of philanthropy,"
3834,LABOR.,I'll make pretence to none.  The love of praise
3835,LABOR.,I count legitimate and laudable.
3836,LABOR.,"'Tis not the noblest motive in the world,"
3837,LABOR.,But it is good; and it has won more fames
3838,LABOR.,"Than any other.  Surely, my good wife,"
3839,LABOR.,"You would not shut me from it, and deprive"
3840,LABOR.,"My power of its sole impulse."""
3841,LABOR.,
3842,LABOR.,"""No; oh! no,"""
3843,LABOR.,"She answered quickly.  ""I am only sad"
3844,LABOR.,That it should be the captain of your host.
3845,LABOR.,All creatures of the brain are the result
3846,LABOR.,Of many motives and of many powers.
3847,LABOR.,"All life is such, indeed.  The power that leads--"
3848,LABOR.,The motive dominant--this stamps the work
3849,LABOR.,With its own likeness.  Throughout all the world
3850,LABOR.,"Are careful souls, with careful consciences,"
3851,LABOR.,That pierce themselves with questionings and fears
3852,LABOR.,"Because that, with the motives which are good,"
3853,LABOR.,"And which alone they seek, a hundred come"
3854,LABOR.,"They do not seek, and aye sophisticate"
3855,LABOR.,Their finest action.  They are wrong in this:
3856,LABOR.,"All motives bowing to one leadership,"
3857,LABOR.,"And aiding its emprise, are one with it--"
3858,LABOR.,"The same in trend, the same in terminus."
3859,LABOR.,"All the low motives that obey the law,"
3860,LABOR.,"And aid the work, of one above them all,"
3861,LABOR.,"Do holy service, and fulfil the end"
3862,LABOR.,For which they were designed.  The love of praise
3863,LABOR.,Is not the lowest motive which can move
3864,LABOR.,"The human soul.  Nay, it may do good work"
3865,LABOR.,"As a subordinate, and leave no soil"
3866,LABOR.,"On whitest fabric, at whose selvage shines"
3867,LABOR.,The Master's broidered signature.  Although
3868,LABOR.,"You write for fame, think not you will escape"
3869,LABOR.,The press of other motives.  You love me;
3870,LABOR.,You love your child; you love your pleasant home;
3871,LABOR.,You love the memory of one long dead.
3872,LABOR.,"These, joined with all those qualities of heart"
3873,LABOR.,"Which make you dear to me, will throng around"
3874,LABOR.,"The leader you appoint, and come and go"
3875,LABOR.,Under his banner; and the work of God
3876,LABOR.,"Will thrive through these, the while your own goes on"
3877,LABOR.,"God will not be defrauded, nor yet man;"
3878,LABOR.,"And you, who like the Pharisees make prayer"
3879,LABOR.,"At corners of the streets, for praise of men,"
3880,LABOR.,"Will have reward you seek."""
3881,LABOR.,
3882,LABOR.,"""Ay, verily!"""
3883,LABOR.,"Responded I with laughter.  ""Verily!"
3884,LABOR.,"Though not a saint, I'll do a saintly work"
3885,LABOR.,"For my own profit, and in spite of all"
3886,LABOR.,"The selfishness that moves me.  Better, this,"
3887,LABOR.,Than I suspected.  My sweet casuist--
3888,LABOR.,"My gentle, learned, lovely casuist--"
3889,LABOR.,I thank you; and I'll pay you more than thanks.
3890,LABOR.,"I'll promise that when these fine motives come,"
3891,LABOR.,"And volunteer their service, they shall find"
3892,LABOR.,"Welcome and entertainment, and a place"
3893,LABOR.,"Within the rank and file, with privilege"
3894,LABOR.,"Of quick promotion, so they show themselves"
3895,LABOR.,"Motives of mettle."""
3896,LABOR.,
3897,LABOR.,This the type of talk
3898,LABOR.,That passed between us.  I was not a fool
3899,LABOR.,"To count her wisdom worthless; nor a God,"
3900,LABOR.,To work regeneration in myself.
3901,LABOR.,"That something which I longed for, to fill up"
3902,LABOR.,"The measure of my good, was human praise;"
3903,LABOR.,"Yet I could see that she was wholly right,"
3904,LABOR.,And that she held within herself resource
3905,LABOR.,Of satisfaction better than my own.
3906,LABOR.,But I was quite content--content to know
3907,LABOR.,I trod the average altitude of those
3908,LABOR.,"Within the paths of art, and had no aims"
3909,LABOR.,To be misconstrued or misunderstood
3910,LABOR.,"By Pride and Selfishness--that these, in truth,"
3911,LABOR.,Expected of me what I had to give.
3912,LABOR.,
3913,LABOR.,"Strange, how a man may carry in his heart,"
3914,LABOR.,"From year to year--through all his life, indeed--"
3915,LABOR.,"A truth, or a conviction, which shall be"
3916,LABOR.,"No more a part of it, and no more worth"
3917,LABOR.,Than to his flask the cork that slips within!
3918,LABOR.,"Of this he learns by sourness of his wine,"
3919,LABOR.,Of muddle of its color; by the bits
3920,LABOR.,That vex his lips while drinking; but he feels
3921,LABOR.,"No impulse in his hand to draw it forth,"
3922,LABOR.,And bid it crown and keep the draught it spoils.
3923,LABOR.,
3924,LABOR.,"I write this, here, not for its relevance"
3925,LABOR.,"To this one passage of my story, but"
3926,LABOR.,Because there slipped into my consciousness
3927,LABOR.,"Just at this juncture, and would not depart,"
3928,LABOR.,"A truth I carried there for many years,"
3929,LABOR.,"Each minute seeing, feeling, tasting it,"
3930,LABOR.,Yet never touching it with an attempt
3931,LABOR.,"To draw it forth, and put it to its place."
3932,LABOR.,
3933,LABOR.,"One evening, when our usual theme was up,"
3934,LABOR.,I asked my wife in playful earnestness
3935,LABOR.,"How she became so wise.  ""You talk,"" I said,"
3936,LABOR.,"""Like one who has survived a thousand years,"
3937,LABOR.,"And drunk the wisdom of a thousand lives."""
3938,LABOR.,
3939,LABOR.,"""Who lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God,"
3940,LABOR.,"Who giveth freely and upbraideth not,"""
3941,LABOR.,Was her reply.
3942,LABOR.,
3943,LABOR.,"""I never ask of God,"""
3944,LABOR.,"I said.  ""So, while you take at second hand"
3945,LABOR.,"His breathings to the artist, I will take"
3946,LABOR.,At second hand the wisdom that he gives
3947,LABOR.,"To you his teacher."""
3948,LABOR.,
3949,LABOR.,"""Do you never pray?"""
3950,LABOR.,
3951,LABOR.,"""Never,"" I answered her.  ""I cannot pray:"
3952,LABOR.,You know the reason.  Never since the day
3953,LABOR.,God shut his heart against my mother's prayer
3954,LABOR.,"Have I raised one petition, or been moved"
3955,LABOR.,"To reverence."""
3956,LABOR.,
3957,LABOR.,"Her long, dark lashes fell,"
3958,LABOR.,And from her eyes there dropped two precious tears
3959,LABOR.,"That bathed her folded hands.  She pitied me,"
3960,LABOR.,With tenderness beyond the reach of words.
3961,LABOR.,"I did not seek her pity.  I was proud,"
3962,LABOR.,And asked her if she blamed me.
3963,LABOR.,
3964,LABOR.,"""No,"" she said;"
3965,LABOR.,"""I have no right to blame you, and no wish."
3966,LABOR.,I marvel only that a man like you
3967,LABOR.,Can hold so long the errors of a boy.
3968,LABOR.,"I've looked--with how much longing, words of mine"
3969,LABOR.,Can never tell--for reason to restore
3970,LABOR.,"That priceless thing which passion stole from you,"
3971,LABOR.,"And looked in vain."""
3972,LABOR.,
3973,LABOR.,Though piqued by the reproach
3974,LABOR.,"Her words conveyed (unwittingly I knew),"
3975,LABOR.,"I wished to learn where, in her theory"
3976,LABOR.,"Of human life, my case had found a place;"
3977,LABOR.,"So, bidding pride aback, I questioned her."
3978,LABOR.,"""You are so wise in other things,"" I said,"
3979,LABOR.,"""And read so well God's dealings with his own,"
3980,LABOR.,Perhaps you can explain this mystery
3981,LABOR.,"That clouds my life."""
3982,LABOR.,
3983,LABOR.,"""I know that God is good,"""
3984,LABOR.,"She answered, ""and, although my reason fail"
3985,LABOR.,To explicate the mystery that wraps
3986,LABOR.,"His providence, it does not shake my faith."
3987,LABOR.,"But this sad case of yours has seemed so plain,"
3988,LABOR.,That Reason well may spare the staff of Faith
3989,LABOR.,"To climb to its conclusions.  You are loved,"
3990,LABOR.,"My husband: can you tell your wife for what?"""
3991,LABOR.,
3992,LABOR.,"""Oh! modesty! my dear; hem! modesty!"
3993,LABOR.,Spare me these blushes!  I have not at hand
3994,LABOR.,The printed catalogue of qualities
3995,LABOR.,"Which give you inspiration, and decline"
3996,LABOR.,"The personal rehearsal."""
3997,LABOR.,
3998,LABOR.,"""You mistake,"""
3999,LABOR.,"She answered, smiling.  ""Not for modesty;"
4000,LABOR.,"And as for blushes, they're not patent yet."
4001,LABOR.,"But frankly, soberly, I ask you this:"
4002,LABOR.,Have you a quality of heart or brain
4003,LABOR.,"Which makes you lovable, and in my eyes"
4004,LABOR.,"A man to be admired, that was not born"
4005,LABOR.,"Quick in your blood?  Pray, have you anything"
4006,LABOR.,Which you did not inherit?  Who to me
4007,LABOR.,Furnished my husband?  By what happy law
4008,LABOR.,"Was all that was the finest, noblest, best"
4009,LABOR.,"In those who gave you life, bestowed on you?"
4010,LABOR.,"You have your father's form, your father's brain:"
4011,LABOR.,"You have your mother's eyes, your mother's heart."
4012,LABOR.,"Those twain produced a man for me to love,"
4013,LABOR.,Out of themselves.  I am obliged to them
4014,LABOR.,"For the most precious good the round earth holds,"
4015,LABOR.,Transmitted by a law that slew them both.
4016,LABOR.,"It was not sin, or shame, for them to die"
4017,LABOR.,Just as they died.  They passed with whiter hands
4018,LABOR.,Up to The Throne than he who wantonly
4019,LABOR.,Murders a sparrow.  When your mother prayed
4020,LABOR.,She prayed for the suspension of the law
4021,LABOR.,"By which from Eve, the mother of the race,"
4022,LABOR.,She had received the grace and loveliness
4023,LABOR.,Which made her precious to your heart--the law
4024,LABOR.,By which alone she could convey these gifts
4025,LABOR.,To others of her blood.  Your daughter's face
4026,LABOR.,"Is beautiful, her soul is pure and sweet,"
4027,LABOR.,"By largess of this law.  Could God subvert,"
4028,LABOR.,"To meet her wish, though shaped in agony,"
4029,LABOR.,"The law which, since the life of man began"
4030,LABOR.,"In life of God, has kept the channel clear"
4031,LABOR.,"For His own blood, that it might bless the last"
4032,LABOR.,Of all the generations as the first?
4033,LABOR.,What could He more than give her liberty--
4034,LABOR.,"When reason lay in torture or in wreck,"
4035,LABOR.,And life was death--to part with stainless hand
4036,LABOR.,"The tie that held her from his loving breast?"""
4037,LABOR.,
4038,LABOR.,If God himself had dropped her words from heaven.
4039,LABOR.,They had not reached with surer plummet-plunge
4040,LABOR.,The depths of my conviction.  I was dumb;
4041,LABOR.,"I opened not my mouth; but left her side,"
4042,LABOR.,And sought the crowded street.  I felt that all
4043,LABOR.,"Delusions, subterfuges, self-deceits,"
4044,LABOR.,"By which my soul had shut itself from God,"
4045,LABOR.,"Were stripped away, and that no barrier"
4046,LABOR.,Was interposed between us which was not
4047,LABOR.,"My own hand's building.  Never, nevermore,"
4048,LABOR.,"Could I hold God in blame, or deem myself"
4049,LABOR.,"A guiltless, injured creature.  I could see"
4050,LABOR.,"That I was hard, implacable, unjust;"
4051,LABOR.,And that by force of wilful choice I held
4052,LABOR.,Myself from God; for no impulsion came
4053,LABOR.,"To seek his face and favor.  Nay, I feared"
4054,LABOR.,"And fought such incidence, as enemy"
4055,LABOR.,Of all my plans.
4056,LABOR.,
4057,LABOR.,So it became thenceforth
4058,LABOR.,A problem with me how to separate
4059,LABOR.,My new conviction from my life--to hold
4060,LABOR.,"A revolutionizing truth within,"
4061,LABOR.,"And hold it yet so loosely, it should be"
4062,LABOR.,Like a dumb alien in a mural town--
4063,LABOR.,"No guest, but an intruder, who might bide,"
4064,LABOR.,"By law or grace, but win no domicile,"
4065,LABOR.,And hold no power.
4066,LABOR.,
4067,LABOR.,"When I returned, that night"
4068,LABOR.,"My course was chosen, with such sense of guilt"
4069,LABOR.,"I blushed before the calm, inquiring eyes"
4070,LABOR.,That met me at my threshhold; but the theme
4071,LABOR.,Was dropped just there.  My gentle mentor read
4072,LABOR.,"The secret of the struggle and the sin,"
4073,LABOR.,And left me to myself.
4074,LABOR.,
4075,LABOR.,"At the set time,"
4076,LABOR.,I entered on my task.  The discipline
4077,LABOR.,"Of early years told feebly on my work,"
4078,LABOR.,For dissipation and disuse of power
4079,LABOR.,Had brought me back to infancy again.
4080,LABOR.,"My will was weak, my patience was at fault,"
4081,LABOR.,"And in my fretful helplessness, I stormed"
4082,LABOR.,And sighed by turns; yet still I held in force
4083,LABOR.,"Determination, as reserve of will;"
4084,LABOR.,"And when I flinched or faltered, always fell"
4085,LABOR.,"Back upon that, and saved my powers from rout."
4086,LABOR.,"Casting, recasting, till I found the germ"
4087,LABOR.,Of my conception putting forth its whorls
4088,LABOR.,In orderly succession round the stem
4089,LABOR.,"Of my design, that straight and strong shot up"
4090,LABOR.,"Toward inflorescence, my long work went on,"
4091,LABOR.,Till I was filled with satisfying joy.
4092,LABOR.,"This lasted for a little time, and then"
4093,LABOR.,There came reaction.  I grew tired of it.
4094,LABOR.,My verses were as meaningless and stale
4095,LABOR.,As doggrel of the stalls.  I marvelled much
4096,LABOR.,That they could ever have beguiled my pride
4097,LABOR.,"Into self-gratulation, or done aught"
4098,LABOR.,"But overwhelm me with contempt for them,"
4099,LABOR.,And the dull pen that wrote them.
4100,LABOR.,
4101,LABOR.,I had hoped
4102,LABOR.,To form and finish my projected work
4103,LABOR.,"Within, and by, myself,--to tease no ear"
4104,LABOR.,"With fragmentary snatches of my song,"
4105,LABOR.,And call for no support from friendly praise
4106,LABOR.,To reinforce my courage; but the stress
4107,LABOR.,"Of my disgust and my despair--the need,"
4108,LABOR.,"Imperative and absolute, to brace myself"
4109,LABOR.,"By some opinion borrowed for the nonce,"
4110,LABOR.,And bathe my spirit in the sympathy
4111,LABOR.,"Of some strong nature--mastered my intent,"
4112,LABOR.,And sent me for resource to her whose heart
4113,LABOR.,Was ever open to my call.
4114,LABOR.,
4115,LABOR.,She sat
4116,LABOR.,"Through the long hour in which I read to her,"
4117,LABOR.,"Absorbed, entranced, as one who sits alone"
4118,LABOR.,"Within a dim cathedral, and resigns"
4119,LABOR.,"His spirit to the organ-theme, that mounts,"
4120,LABOR.,"Or sinks in tremulous pauses, or sweeps out"
4121,LABOR.,On mighty pinions and with trumpet voice
4122,LABOR.,"Through labyrinthine harmonies, at last"
4123,LABOR.,"Emerging, and through silver clouds of sound"
4124,LABOR.,"Receding and receding, till it melts"
4125,LABOR.,In the abysses of the upper sky.
4126,LABOR.,It was not needful she should say a word;
4127,LABOR.,"For in her glowing eyes and kindling face,"
4128,LABOR.,I caught the full assurance that my heart
4129,LABOR.,Had yearned for; but she spoke her hearty praise
4130,LABOR.,"And when I asked her for her criticism,"
4131,LABOR.,Bestowed it with such modest deference
4132,LABOR.,"To my opinion, as to spare my pride;"
4133,LABOR.,"Yet, with such subtle sense of harmony,"
4134,LABOR.,"And insight of proportion, that I saw"
4135,LABOR.,That I should find no critic in the world
4136,LABOR.,"More competent or more severe.  I said,"
4137,LABOR.,"Gulping my pride: ""Better this ordeal"
4138,LABOR.,"In friendly hands, before the time of types,"
4139,LABOR.,"Than afterward, in hands of enemies!"""
4140,LABOR.,
4141,LABOR.,"So, from that reading, it was understood"
4142,LABOR.,"Between us that, whenever I essayed"
4143,LABOR.,"Revising and retouching, I should know"
4144,LABOR.,"Her intimate impressions, and receive"
4145,LABOR.,Her frank suggestions.  In this oversight
4146,LABOR.,And constant interest of one whose mind
4147,LABOR.,"Was excellent and pure, and raised above"
4148,LABOR.,"All motive to beguile me, I secured"
4149,LABOR.,New inspiration.
4150,LABOR.,
4151,LABOR.,Weeks and months passed by
4152,LABOR.,"With gradient hopefulness, and strength renewed"
4153,LABOR.,At each renewal of the confidence
4154,LABOR.,I had reposed in her; till I perceived
4155,LABOR.,That I was living on her praise--that she
4156,LABOR.,Held God's place in me and the multitude's.
4157,LABOR.,"And now, as I look back upon those days"
4158,LABOR.,"Of difficult endeavor, I confess"
4159,LABOR.,"That had she not been with me, I had failed--"
4160,LABOR.,"Ay, foundered in mid-sea--my hope, my life,"
4161,LABOR.,The spoil of deep oblivion.
4162,LABOR.,
4163,LABOR.,At last
4164,LABOR.,The work was done--the labored volume closed.
4165,LABOR.,"""I cannot make it better,"" I exclaimed."
4166,LABOR.,"""I can write better, but, before I write,"
4167,LABOR.,I must have recognition in the voice
4168,LABOR.,Of public praise.  A good paymaster pays
4169,LABOR.,"When work is finished.  Let him pay for this,"
4170,LABOR.,"And I will work again; but, till he pay,"
4171,LABOR.,"My leisure is my own, and I will wait."""
4172,LABOR.,
4173,LABOR.,"""And if he grudge your wage?"" suggested she"
4174,LABOR.,To whom I spoke.
4175,LABOR.,
4176,LABOR.,"""I shall be finished too."""
4177,LABOR.,
4178,LABOR.,Came then the proofs and latest polishing
4179,LABOR.,Of words and phrases--work I shared with her
4180,LABOR.,"To whom I owed so much; and then the fear,"
4181,LABOR.,"The deathly heart-fall, and the haunting dread"
4182,LABOR.,That go before exposure to the world
4183,LABOR.,"Of inmost life, and utmost reach of power"
4184,LABOR.,"Toward revelation;--then the shrinking spell,"
4185,LABOR.,When morbid love of self awaits in pain
4186,LABOR.,The verdict it has courted.
4187,LABOR.,
4188,LABOR.,But at last
4189,LABOR.,The book was out.  My daughter's hand in mine--
4190,LABOR.,"Her careless feet, that thrilled with springing life,"
4191,LABOR.,"Skipping the pavement--I walked down Broadway,"
4192,LABOR.,To ease the restlessness and cool the heat
4193,LABOR.,That vexed my idle waiting.  As we passed
4194,LABOR.,"A showy window, filled with costly books,"
4195,LABOR.,"My little girl exclaimed: ""Oh, father!  See!"
4196,LABOR.,"There is your name!"""
4197,LABOR.,
4198,LABOR.,Straight all the bravery
4199,LABOR.,"Within my veins, at one wild heart-thump, dropped,"
4200,LABOR.,"And I was limp as water; but I paused,"
4201,LABOR.,And read the placard.  It announced my book
4202,LABOR.,"In characters of flame, with adjectives"
4203,LABOR.,"My daring publisher had filched, I think"
4204,LABOR.,From an old circus broadside.
4205,LABOR.,
4206,LABOR.,"""Well!"" thought I--"
4207,LABOR.,"Biting my lip--""I'm in the market now!"
4208,LABOR.,"How much--O! rattling, roaring multitude!"
4209,LABOR.,"O! selfish, cheating, lying multitude!"
4210,LABOR.,"O! hawking, trading, delving multitude!--"
4211,LABOR.,"How much for one man's hope, for one man's life?"
4212,LABOR.,What for his toil and pain?--his heart's red blood?
4213,LABOR.,"What for his brains and breeding?  Oh, how much"
4214,LABOR.,"For one who craves your praises with your pence,"
4215,LABOR.,"And dies with your denial?"""
4216,LABOR.,
4217,LABOR.,"I went in,"
4218,LABOR.,And bought my book--not doubting I was first
4219,LABOR.,To give response to my apostrophe.
4220,LABOR.,"The smug old clerk, who found his length of ear"
4221,LABOR.,"Convenient as a pencil-rack, and thus"
4222,LABOR.,"Made nature's wrath proclaim the praise of trade,"
4223,LABOR.,"Wrapped my dear bantling well; and, as he dropped"
4224,LABOR.,"My dollar in his till, smiled languidly"
4225,LABOR.,"Upon my little girl, and said to me--"
4226,LABOR.,To cheer me in my purchase--that the book
4227,LABOR.,Was thought to be a deuced clever thing.
4228,LABOR.,He never read such books; he had no time;
4229,LABOR.,"Indeed, he had no interest in them."
4230,LABOR.,"Still, other people had, and it was well,"
4231,LABOR.,For it helped trade along.
4232,LABOR.,
4233,LABOR.,It was for him--
4234,LABOR.,A vulgar fraction of the integral
4235,LABOR.,"We speak of as ""the people,"" and ""the world""--"
4236,LABOR.,"I had been writing!  Had he read my book,"
4237,LABOR.,"And given it his praise, I should have been"
4238,LABOR.,"Delighted, though I knew that his applause"
4239,LABOR.,Was worthless as his brooch.  I was a fool
4240,LABOR.,"Undoubtedly; yet I could understand,"
4241,LABOR.,"Better than e'er before, how separate"
4242,LABOR.,The artist is from such a soul as his--
4243,LABOR.,What need of teachers and interpreters
4244,LABOR.,To crumble in his pewter porringer
4245,LABOR.,"The rounded loaf, whose crust was adamant"
4246,LABOR.,To his weak fingers.
4247,LABOR.,
4248,LABOR.,The next morning's press
4249,LABOR.,"Was purchased early, though I read in vain"
4250,LABOR.,"To find my reputation.  But at night,"
4251,LABOR.,My door-bell rang; and I received a note
4252,LABOR.,"From one who edited an evening print,"
4253,LABOR.,"(I had dined with him at my publisher's),"
4254,LABOR.,"Inclosing a review, and venturing"
4255,LABOR.,The hope that I should like it.
4256,LABOR.,
4257,LABOR.,Cunning man!
4258,LABOR.,"He knew the tricks of trade, and was adroit."
4259,LABOR.,"My poem was ""a revelation.""  I had ""burst"
4260,LABOR.,"Like thunder from a calm and cloudless sky."""
4261,LABOR.,"Well, not to quote his language, this the drift:"
4262,LABOR.,"A man of fortune, living at his ease,"
4263,LABOR.,"But fond of manly effort, had sat down,"
4264,LABOR.,And turned his culture to supreme account;
4265,LABOR.,And he--the editor--took on himself
4266,LABOR.,"To thank him on the world's behalf.  Withal,"
4267,LABOR.,The poet had betrayed the continence
4268,LABOR.,"Of genius.  He had held, undoubtedly,"
4269,LABOR.,The consciousness of power from early youth;
4270,LABOR.,"But, yielding never to the itch for print,"
4271,LABOR.,"Had nursed and chastened and developed it,"
4272,LABOR.,"Until his hand was strong, and swept his lyre"
4273,LABOR.,With magic of a master.
4274,LABOR.,
4275,LABOR.,Followed here
4276,LABOR.,Sage comments on the rathe and puny brood
4277,LABOR.,"Of poet-sucklings, who had rushed to type"
4278,LABOR.,Before their time--pale stems that spun their flowers
4279,LABOR.,"In the first sunshine, but, when Autumn came,"
4280,LABOR.,"Were fruitless.  It was pleasant, too, to see,"
4281,LABOR.,"In such an age of sentimental cant,"
4282,LABOR.,One man who dared to hold up to the world
4283,LABOR.,"A creature of his brain, and say: ""Look you!"
4284,LABOR.,This is my thought; and it shall stand alone.
4285,LABOR.,"It has no moral, bears no ministry"
4286,LABOR.,"Of pious teaching, and makes no appeal"
4287,LABOR.,To sufferance or suffrage of the muffs
4288,LABOR.,"Who, in the pulpit or the press, prepare"
4289,LABOR.,The nation's pap.  The fiery-footed barb
4290,LABOR.,"That pounds the pampas, and the lily-bells"
4291,LABOR.,"That hang above the brooks, present the world"
4292,LABOR.,"With no apology for being there,"
4293,LABOR.,And no attempt to justify themselves
4294,LABOR.,In uselessness.  It is enough for God
4295,LABOR.,"That they are beautiful, and hold his thought"
4296,LABOR.,In fine embodiment; and it shall be
4297,LABOR.,"Enough for me that, in this book of mine,"
4298,LABOR.,I have created somewhat that is strong
4299,LABOR.,"And beautiful, which, if it profit,--well:"
4300,LABOR.,"If not, 'tis no less strong and beautiful,"
4301,LABOR.,"And holds its being by no feebler right."""
4302,LABOR.,
4303,LABOR.,"Ay, it was glorious to find one man"
4304,LABOR.,"Who piled no packs upon his Pegasus,"
4305,LABOR.,"Nor chained him to a rag-cart, loaded down"
4306,LABOR.,"With moral frippery, and strings of bells"
4307,LABOR.,To call the people to their windows.
4308,LABOR.,
4309,LABOR.,Then
4310,LABOR.,"There followed extracts, with a change of type"
4311,LABOR.,To mark the places where the editor
4312,LABOR.,"Had caught a fancy hiding, which he feared"
4313,LABOR.,Might slip detection under slower eyes
4314,LABOR.,Than those he carried; or to emphasize
4315,LABOR.,Felicities of diction that were stiff
4316,LABOR.,"In Roman verticals, but grew divine"
4317,LABOR.,"At the Italic angle; then apology,"
4318,LABOR.,"Profoundly humble, to his patrons all"
4319,LABOR.,"For quoting at such length, and one to me"
4320,LABOR.,"For quoting anything, and deep regrets,"
4321,LABOR.,"In quite a general way, that lack of space"
4322,LABOR.,Forbade a reproduction of the book
4323,LABOR.,"From title-page to tail-piece, winding up"
4324,LABOR.,"With counsel to all lovers of pure art,"
4325,LABOR.,"Patrons of genius, all Americans,"
4326,LABOR.,"All friends of cis-Atlantic literature,"
4327,LABOR.,"To buy the book, and read it for themselves."
4328,LABOR.,
4329,LABOR.,"I drank the whole, at one long, luscious draught;"
4330,LABOR.,"Tipping the tankard high, that I might see"
4331,LABOR.,"My features at the bottom, and regale"
4332,LABOR.,"My pride, after my palate.  Then I tossed"
4333,LABOR.,"The paper to my wife, and bade her read."
4334,LABOR.,"I watched her while she read, but failed to find"
4335,LABOR.,The sympathy of pleasure in her face
4336,LABOR.,"I had expected.  Finishing at last,"
4337,LABOR.,"She raised her eyes, and, fixing them on me,"
4338,LABOR.,"Said thoughtfully: ""You like this, I suspect."""
4339,LABOR.,
4340,LABOR.,"""Well, truly!"" I responded, ""since it seems"
4341,LABOR.,To be the first instalment of the wage
4342,LABOR.,Which you suggested might come grudgingly.
4343,LABOR.,"Ay, it is sweet to me.  I know it fails"
4344,LABOR.,"In nice discrimination,--that it slurs"
4345,LABOR.,Defects which I perceive as well as you;
4346,LABOR.,"But it is kind, and places in best light"
4347,LABOR.,Such excellences as we both may find--
4348,LABOR.,"May claim, indeed."""
4349,LABOR.,
4350,LABOR.,"""And yet, it is a lie,"
4351,LABOR.,"Or what the editor would call 'a puff,'"
4352,LABOR.,"From first to last.  The 'continence,' my dear,"
4353,LABOR.,'Of genius!'  What of that?  And what about
4354,LABOR.,"The 'manly effort,' for whose exercise"
4355,LABOR.,He thanked you on the world's behalf?  And so
4356,LABOR.,"Your nursing, chastening and developing"
4357,LABOR.,"Of power!--Pray what of these?"""
4358,LABOR.,
4359,LABOR.,"""Oh! wife!"" I said,"
4360,LABOR.,"""Don't spoil it all!  Be pitiful, my love!"
4361,LABOR.,I am a baby--granted: so I need
4362,LABOR.,"The touch of tender hands, and something sweet"
4363,LABOR.,"To keep me happy."""
4364,LABOR.,
4365,LABOR.,"""Babies take a bath,"
4366,LABOR.,"Sometimes, from which the hand of warmest love"
4367,LABOR.,"Filches the chill, and you must have one dash,"""
4368,LABOR.,"She answered me, ""to close your complement."
4369,LABOR.,"The weakest spot in all your book, he found"
4370,LABOR.,With a quick instinct; and on that he spent
4371,LABOR.,"His sharpest force and finest rhetoric,"
4372,LABOR.,Shoring and bracing it on every side
4373,LABOR.,"With bold assumptions and affirmatives,"
4374,LABOR.,"To blind the eyes of novices, and scare"
4375,LABOR.,With fierce forestalment all the critic-quills
4376,LABOR.,Now bristling for their chance.  He saw at once
4377,LABOR.,"Your poem had no mission, save, perhaps,"
4378,LABOR.,"The tickle of the taste, and that it bore"
4379,LABOR.,Upon its glowing gold small food for life.
4380,LABOR.,He saw just there the point to be attacked;
4381,LABOR.,"And there threw up his earth-works, and spread out"
4382,LABOR.,His thorned abattis.  He was very kind
4383,LABOR.,"Undoubtedly, and very cunning, too;"
4384,LABOR.,For well he knew that there are earnest souls
4385,LABOR.,"In the broad world, who claim that highest art"
4386,LABOR.,Is highest ministry to human need;
4387,LABOR.,And that the artist has no Christian right
4388,LABOR.,"To prostitute his art to selfish ends,"
4389,LABOR.,Or make it vehicle alone of plums
4390,LABOR.,"For the world's pudding."""
4391,LABOR.,
4392,LABOR.,"""These will speak in time,"""
4393,LABOR.,"Responded I; ""but they have not the ear"
4394,LABOR.,"Of the broad world, I think.  The Christian right"
4395,LABOR.,Of which you speak is hardly recognized
4396,LABOR.,"Among the multitude, or by the guild"
4397,LABOR.,In which I claim a place.  The sectaries
4398,LABOR.,"Who furnish folios, quartos, magazines,"
4399,LABOR.,"To the religious few, are limited"
4400,LABOR.,"In influence; and these, my wife, are all"
4401,LABOR.,"I have to fear;--nay, could I but arouse"
4402,LABOR.,"Their bitter enmity, I might receive"
4403,LABOR.,Such superflux of praise and patronage
4404,LABOR.,As would o'erwhelm my sweetly Christian wife
4405,LABOR.,With shame and misery.  But we shall see;
4406,LABOR.,"And, in the meantime, let us be content"
4407,LABOR.,"That, if one man shall praise me overmuch,"
4408,LABOR.,"Ten, at the least, will fail to render me"
4409,LABOR.,"Befitting justice."""
4410,LABOR.,
4411,LABOR.,"As the days went on,"
4412,LABOR.,Reviews and notices came pouring in.
4413,LABOR.,"I was notorious, at least; and fame,"
4414,LABOR.,"I whispered comfortably to myself,"
4415,LABOR.,"Is only notoriety turned gray,"
4416,LABOR.,"With less of fire, if more of steadiness."
4417,LABOR.,The adverse verdicts were not numerous;
4418,LABOR.,"And these were rendered, as I fancied then,"
4419,LABOR.,By sanctimonious fools who deemed profane
4420,LABOR.,All verse outside their thumb-worn hymnodies.
4421,LABOR.,My book received the rattling fusilade
4422,LABOR.,Of all the dailies: then the artillery
4423,LABOR.,"Of the hebdomadals, whose noisy shells,"
4424,LABOR.,"Though timed by fuse to burst on Saturday,"
4425,LABOR.,Exploded at the middle of the week;
4426,LABOR.,"At last, a hundred-pounder quarterly"
4427,LABOR.,Gave it a single missive from its mask
4428,LABOR.,Of far and dark impersonality.
4429,LABOR.,"The smoke cleared up, and still my colors"
4430,LABOR.,"And still my book stood proudly in the sun,"
4431,LABOR.,Nor breached nor battered.
4432,LABOR.,
4433,LABOR.,I had won a place
4434,LABOR.,That I was sure of.  All had said of me
4435,LABOR.,"That I was ""brilliant:"" was not that enough?"
4436,LABOR.,"The petty pesterers, with card and stamp,"
4437,LABOR.,"Who hunt for autographs, were after me,"
4438,LABOR.,In packages by post; and idle men
4439,LABOR.,"Held me at corners by the button-hole,"
4440,LABOR.,And introduced me to their friends.  I dined
4441,LABOR.,"With meek-eyed men, whose literary wives"
4442,LABOR.,"Were dying all to know me, as they said;"
4443,LABOR.,"And the lyceums, quick at scent and sight--"
4444,LABOR.,Watching the jungles for a lion--all
4445,LABOR.,Courted the delectation of my roar
4446,LABOR.,"Upon their platforms, pledging to my hand"
4447,LABOR.,"(With city reference to stanchest names),"
4448,LABOR.,Such honoraria as would have been
4449,LABOR.,The lion's share of profits.  These were straws;
4450,LABOR.,But they had surer fingers for the wind
4451,LABOR.,Than withes or weathercocks.
4452,LABOR.,
4453,LABOR.,The book sold well
4454,LABOR.,"My publisher (who published at my risk,"
4455,LABOR.,And first put on the airs of one who stooped
4456,LABOR.,"To grant a favor), brimmed and overflowed"
4457,LABOR.,"With courtesy; and ere a year was gone,"
4458,LABOR.,Became importunate for something more.
4459,LABOR.,This was his plea: I owed it to myself
4460,LABOR.,To write again.  The time to make one's hay
4461,LABOR.,Is when the sun shines: time to write one's books
4462,LABOR.,Is when the public humor turns to them.
4463,LABOR.,"The public would forget me in a year,"
4464,LABOR.,"And seek another idol; or, meanwhile,"
4465,LABOR.,"Another writer might usurp my throne,"
4466,LABOR.,And I be hooted from my own domain
4467,LABOR.,As a pretender.  Then the market's maw
4468,LABOR.,Was greedy for my poems.  Just how long
4469,LABOR.,"The appetite would last, he could not tell,"
4470,LABOR.,"For appetite is subject of caprice,"
4471,LABOR.,And never lasts too long.
4472,LABOR.,
4473,LABOR.,"The man was wise,"
4474,LABOR.,"I plainly saw, and gave me the results"
4475,LABOR.,Of observation and experience.
4476,LABOR.,"I took his hint, accepting with a pang"
4477,LABOR.,"The truths that came with it: for instance, these:--"
4478,LABOR.,"That he who speaks for praise of those who live,"
4479,LABOR.,"Must keep himself before his audience,"
4480,LABOR.,"Nor look for ""bravas,"" cheers, and cries of ""hear!"
4481,LABOR.,"And clap of hands and stamp of feet, except"
4482,LABOR.,"With fresh occasion; that applause of crowds,"
4483,LABOR.,"Though fierce, runs never to the chronic stage;"
4484,LABOR.,"That good paymasters, having paid for work"
4485,LABOR.,"The doer's price, expect receipt in full"
4486,LABOR.,At even date; and that if I would keep
4487,LABOR.,"My place, as grand purveyor to the greed"
4488,LABOR.,"For novelties of literary art,"
4489,LABOR.,"My viands must be sapid, and abound"
4490,LABOR.,"With change, to wake or whet the appetite"
4491,LABOR.,I sought to feed.
4492,LABOR.,
4493,LABOR.,I say I took his hint.
4494,LABOR.,"Bestowed in selfishness, without a doubt,"
4495,LABOR.,Though in my interest.  For ten long years
4496,LABOR.,It was the basis of my policy.
4497,LABOR.,I poured my poems with redundancy
4498,LABOR.,"Upon the world, and won redundant meed."
4499,LABOR.,"If I gave much, the world was generous,"
4500,LABOR.,"Repaying more than justice: but, at last,"
4501,LABOR.,"Tired and disgusted, I laid down my pen."
4502,LABOR.,"I knew my work would not outlast my life,"
4503,LABOR.,That the enchantments which had wreathed themselves
4504,LABOR.,"Around my name were withering away,"
4505,LABOR.,With every breath of fragrance they exhaled;
4506,LABOR.,"And that, too soon, the active brain and hand"
4507,LABOR.,"Whose skill had conjured them, would faint and fail"
4508,LABOR.,Under the press of weariness and years.
4509,LABOR.,My reputation piqued me.  None believed
4510,LABOR.,That it was in me to write otherwise
4511,LABOR.,"Than I had written.  All the world had laughed,"
4512,LABOR.,"Or shaken its wise head, had I essayed"
4513,LABOR.,A work beyond the round of brilliancies
4514,LABOR.,"In which my pen had revelled, and for which"
4515,LABOR.,"It gave such princely guerdon.  If I looked,"
4516,LABOR.,"Or came to look, with measureless contempt"
4517,LABOR.,On those who gave with such munificence
4518,LABOR.,"The boon I sought, I had provoking cause."
4519,LABOR.,"I fooled them all with patent worthlessness,"
4520,LABOR.,And they insisted I should fool them still.
4521,LABOR.,The wisdom of a whole decade had failed
4522,LABOR.,To teach them that the thing my hand had done
4523,LABOR.,Was not worth doing.
4524,LABOR.,
4525,LABOR.,More and worse than this;
4526,LABOR.,I found my character and self-respect
4527,LABOR.,"Eroded by the canker of conceit,"
4528,LABOR.,"Poisoned by jealousy, and made the prey"
4529,LABOR.,"Of meanest passions.  Harlequins in mask,"
4530,LABOR.,Who live upon the laughter of the throng
4531,LABOR.,That crowds their reeking amphitheatres;
4532,LABOR.,"Light-footed dancing-girls, who sell their grace"
4533,LABOR.,"To gaping lechers of the pit, to win"
4534,LABOR.,That which shall feed their shameless vanity;
4535,LABOR.,"The mimics of the buskin--baser still,"
4536,LABOR.,The mimics of the negro--minstrel-bands.
4537,LABOR.,With capital of corks and castanets
4538,LABOR.,And threadbare jests--Ah! who and what was I
4539,LABOR.,"But brother of all these--in higher walk,"
4540,LABOR.,"But brother in the motive of my life,"
4541,LABOR.,"In jealousy, in recompense for toil,"
4542,LABOR.,"And, last, in destiny?"
4543,LABOR.,
4544,LABOR.,My wife had caught
4545,LABOR.,Stray silver in her hair in these long years;
4546,LABOR.,And the sweet maiden springing from our lives
4547,LABOR.,"Had grown to womanhood.  In my pursuits,"
4548,LABOR.,"Which drank my time and my vitality,"
4549,LABOR.,"I had neglected them.  I worked at home,"
4550,LABOR.,"But lived in other scenes, for other lives,"
4551,LABOR.,"Or, rather, for my own; and though my pride"
4552,LABOR.,"Shrank from the deed, I had the tardy grace"
4553,LABOR.,"To call them to me, and confess my shame,"
4554,LABOR.,And beg for their forgiveness.
4555,LABOR.,
4556,LABOR.,Once again--
4557,LABOR.,All explanations passed--I sat beside
4558,LABOR.,"My faithful wife, and canvassed as of old"
4559,LABOR.,New plans of life.  I found her still the same
4560,LABOR.,In purpose and in magnanimity;
4561,LABOR.,For she dealt no upbraidings and no blame;
4562,LABOR.,Cast in my teeth no old-time prophecies
4563,LABOR.,Of failure; felt no triumph which rejoiced
4564,LABOR.,"To mock me with the words, ""I told you so,"""
4565,LABOR.,"Calmly she sat, and tried, with gentlest speech,"
4566,LABOR.,To heal the bruises of my fall; to wake
4567,LABOR.,"A better feeling in me toward the world,"
4568,LABOR.,And soothe my morbid self-contempt.
4569,LABOR.,
4570,LABOR.,"The world,"
4571,LABOR.,"She said, is apt to take a public man"
4572,LABOR.,"At his own estimate, and yield him place"
4573,LABOR.,According to his choice.  I had essayed
4574,LABOR.,"To please the world, and gather in its praise;"
4575,LABOR.,"And, certainly, the world was pleased with me,"
4576,LABOR.,And had not stinted me in its return
4577,LABOR.,Of plauditory payment.  As the world
4578,LABOR.,"Had taken me according to my rate,"
4579,LABOR.,"And filled my wish, it had a valid claim"
4580,LABOR.,On my good nature.
4581,LABOR.,
4582,LABOR.,"Then, beyond all this,"
4583,LABOR.,"The world was not a fool.  Those books of mine,"
4584,LABOR.,"That I had come to look upon as trash,"
4585,LABOR.,"Were not all trash.  My motive had been poor,"
4586,LABOR.,And that had vitiated them for me;
4587,LABOR.,But there was much in them that yielded strength
4588,LABOR.,"To struggling souls, and, to the wounded, balm."
4589,LABOR.,"Indeed, she had been helped by them, herself."
4590,LABOR.,They were all pure; they made no foul appeal
4591,LABOR.,To baseness and brutality; they had
4592,LABOR.,"An element of gentle chivalry,"
4593,LABOR.,Such as must have a place in any man
4594,LABOR.,"Shrinking with sensitiveness, like myself,"
4595,LABOR.,"From a fine reputation, scorning it"
4596,LABOR.,For motive which had won it.
4597,LABOR.,
4598,LABOR.,"Words like these,"
4599,LABOR.,"From lips like hers, were needed medicine."
4600,LABOR.,"They clarified my weak and jaundiced sight,"
4601,LABOR.,"And helped to juster vision of the world,"
4602,LABOR.,And of myself.  But there was no return
4603,LABOR.,"Of the old greed; and fame, which I had learned"
4604,LABOR.,To be an entity quite different
4605,LABOR.,"From my conceit of it in other days,"
4606,LABOR.,Was something much too far and nebulous
4607,LABOR.,To be my star of life.
4608,LABOR.,
4609,LABOR.,"""You have some plan?""--"
4610,LABOR.,"Statement and query in same words, which fell"
4611,LABOR.,From lips that sought to rehabilitate
4612,LABOR.,My will and self-respect.
4613,LABOR.,
4614,LABOR.,"""I have,"" I said."
4615,LABOR.,
4616,LABOR.,"""Else you were dead,"" responded she.  ""To live,"
4617,LABOR.,Men must have plans.  When these die out of men
4618,LABOR.,"They crumble into chaos, or relapse"
4619,LABOR.,Into inanity.  Will you reveal
4620,LABOR.,"These plans of yours to me?"""
4621,LABOR.,
4622,LABOR.,"""Ay, if I can,"""
4623,LABOR.,"I answered her; ""but first I must reveal"
4624,LABOR.,The base on which I build them.  I have tried
4625,LABOR.,"To find the occasion of my discontent,"
4626,LABOR.,"And find it, as I think, just here; in quest"
4627,LABOR.,"Of popularity, I have become"
4628,LABOR.,Untrue both to myself and to my art.
4629,LABOR.,I have not dared to speak the royal truth
4630,LABOR.,For fear of censure; I have been a slave
4631,LABOR.,To men's opinions.  What is best in me
4632,LABOR.,Has been debauched by the pursuit of praise
4633,LABOR.,"As life's best prize.  Conviction, sentiment,"
4634,LABOR.,"All love and hate, all sense of right and wrong,"
4635,LABOR.,"I have held in abeyance, or compelled"
4636,LABOR.,To work in menial subservience
4637,LABOR.,To my grand purpose.  If my sentiment
4638,LABOR.,"Or my conviction were but popular,"
4639,LABOR.,"It flowed in hearty numbers: otherwise,"
4640,LABOR.,It slept in silence.
4641,LABOR.,
4642,LABOR.,"""Now as to my art;"
4643,LABOR.,"I find that it has suffered like myself,"
4644,LABOR.,And suffered from same cause.  My verse has been
4645,LABOR.,Shaped evermore to meet the people's thought.
4646,LABOR.,"That which was highest, grandest in my art"
4647,LABOR.,"I have not reached, and have not tried to reach"
4648,LABOR.,I have but touched the surfaces of things
4649,LABOR.,That meet the common vision; and my art
4650,LABOR.,Has only aimed to clothe them gracefully
4651,LABOR.,"With fancy's gaudy fabrics, or portray"
4652,LABOR.,Their patent beauties and deformities.
4653,LABOR.,"Above the people in my gift and art,"
4654,LABOR.,Both gift and art have had a downward trend
4655,LABOR.,And both are prostitute.
4656,LABOR.,
4657,LABOR.,"""Discarding praise"
4658,LABOR.,"As motive of my labor, I confess"
4659,LABOR.,"My sins against my art, and so, henceforth,"
4660,LABOR.,"As to my goddess, give myself to her."
4661,LABOR.,The chivalry which you are pleased to note
4662,LABOR.,"In me and works of mine, turns loyally"
4663,LABOR.,To her and to her service.  Nevermore
4664,LABOR.,Shall pen of mine demean itself by work
4665,LABOR.,"That serves not first, and with supreme intent,"
4666,LABOR.,"The art whose slave it is."""
4667,LABOR.,
4668,LABOR.,"""I understand,"
4669,LABOR.,"I think, the basis of your plan,"" she said;"
4670,LABOR.,"""And e'en the plan itself.  You now propose"
4671,LABOR.,To write without remotest reference
4672,LABOR.,"To the world's wishes, prejudices, needs,"
4673,LABOR.,"Or e'en the world's opinions,--quite content"
4674,LABOR.,If the world find aught in you to applaud;
4675,LABOR.,Quite as content if it condemn.  With full
4676,LABOR.,Expression of yourself in finest terms
4677,LABOR.,"And noblest forms of art, so far as God"
4678,LABOR.,"Has made you masterful, you give yourself"
4679,LABOR.,Up to yourself and to your art.  Is this
4680,LABOR.,"Fair statement of your purpose?"""
4681,LABOR.,
4682,LABOR.,"""Not unfair,"""
4683,LABOR.,"I answered.  ""Tell me what you think of it."""
4684,LABOR.,
4685,LABOR.,"""Suppose,"" she said, ""that all the artist-souls"
4686,LABOR.,That God has made since time and art began
4687,LABOR.,Had acted on your theory: suppose
4688,LABOR.,"In architecture, picture, poetry,"
4689,LABOR.,Naught had found utterance but works that sprang
4690,LABOR.,"To satisfy the worker, and reveal"
4691,LABOR.,"That bundle of ideas which, to him,"
4692,LABOR.,"Is constituted art; but which, in truth,"
4693,LABOR.,"Is figment of his fancy, or his thought,--"
4694,LABOR.,"His creature, made his God--say where were all"
4695,LABOR.,"The temples, palaces and homes of men;"
4696,LABOR.,"The galleries that blaze with history,"
4697,LABOR.,"Or bloom with landscape, or look down"
4698,LABOR.,With smile of changeless love or loveliness
4699,LABOR.,Into the hearts of men?  And where were all
4700,LABOR.,"The poems that give measure to their praise,"
4701,LABOR.,"Voice to their aspirations, forms of light"
4702,LABOR.,"To homely facts and features of their life,"
4703,LABOR.,"Enveloping this plain, prosaic world"
4704,LABOR.,"In an ideal atmosphere, in which"
4705,LABOR.,Fair angels come and go?  All gifts of men
4706,LABOR.,"Were made for use, and made for highest use,"
4707,LABOR.,"If highest use be service of one's self,"
4708,LABOR.,"And highest standard, one's embodiment"
4709,LABOR.,"Of dogmas, theories and thoughts of art,"
4710,LABOR.,"As art's identity, then are you right;"
4711,LABOR.,But if a higher use of gift and art
4712,LABOR.,"Be service of mankind, and higher rule"
4713,LABOR.,"God's regal truth, revealed in words or worlds,"
4714,LABOR.,"And verified by life, then are you wrong."""
4715,LABOR.,
4716,LABOR.,"""But art?""--responded I--""you do not mean"
4717,LABOR.,"That art is nothing but a thing of thought,"
4718,LABOR.,"Or, less than that, of fancy?  Nay, I claim"
4719,LABOR.,That it is somewhat--a grand entity--
4720,LABOR.,"An organism of lofty principles,"
4721,LABOR.,"Informed with subtlest life, and clothed upon"
4722,LABOR.,With usage and tradition of the men
4723,LABOR.,"Who, working in those sunny provinces"
4724,LABOR.,"Where it holds eminent domain, have brought"
4725,LABOR.,To build its temple and adorn its walls
4726,LABOR.,The usufruct of countless lives.  So far
4727,LABOR.,Is art from being creature of man's thought
4728,LABOR.,That it is subject of his knowledge--stands
4729,LABOR.,"In mighty mystery, and challenges"
4730,LABOR.,The study of the world; rules noblest minds
4731,LABOR.,Like law or like religion; is a power
4732,LABOR.,To which the proudest artist-spirits bow
4733,LABOR.,With humblest homage.  Is astronomy
4734,LABOR.,The creature of man's thought?  Is chemistry?
4735,LABOR.,"Yet these hold not, in this our universe,"
4736,LABOR.,"A form more definite, nor yet a place"
4737,LABOR.,"In human knowledge more beyond dispute,"
4738,LABOR.,Than art itself.  To this embodiment
4739,LABOR.,"Of theory--of dogmas, if you will--"
4740,LABOR.,This body aggregate of truth revealed
4741,LABOR.,In growing light of ages to the eyes
4742,LABOR.,"Touched to perception, I devote my life."""
4743,LABOR.,
4744,LABOR.,"""Nay, you're too fast,"" she said: ""let alchemy"
4745,LABOR.,And old astrology present your thought.
4746,LABOR.,These were somewhat; these were grand entities;
4747,LABOR.,But they went out like candles in thin air
4748,LABOR.,When knowledge came.  The sciences are things
4749,LABOR.,"Of law, of force, relations, measurements,"
4750,LABOR.,"Affinities and combinations, all"
4751,LABOR.,"The definite, demonstrable effects"
4752,LABOR.,Of first and second causes.  Between these
4753,LABOR.,"And men's opinions, braced by usages,"
4754,LABOR.,The space is wide.  The thing which you call art
4755,LABOR.,"Is anything but definite in form,"
4756,LABOR.,Or fixed in law.  It has as many shapes
4757,LABOR.,"As worshippers.  The world has many books,"
4758,LABOR.,"Written by earnest men, about this art;"
4759,LABOR.,"But having read them, we are no more wise"
4760,LABOR.,Than he whose observation of the sun
4761,LABOR.,Is taken by kaleidoscope.  The more
4762,LABOR.,"He sees in it, the more he is confused."
4763,LABOR.,"The sun works, doubtless, many fine effects"
4764,LABOR.,"With what he sees, but he sees not the sun."""
4765,LABOR.,
4766,LABOR.,"""But art is art,"" I said.  ""You'd cheat my sense."
4767,LABOR.,"And mock my reason too.  Ay, art is art."
4768,LABOR.,"Things must have being that have history."""
4769,LABOR.,
4770,LABOR.,"Then she: ""Yes, politics has history,"
4771,LABOR.,"And therefore has a being,--has, in truth,"
4772,LABOR.,Just such a being as I grant to art--
4773,LABOR.,A being of opinions.  Every state
4774,LABOR.,Has origin and ends of government
4775,LABOR.,"Peculiarly its own, and so, from these,"
4776,LABOR.,"Constructs its theory of politics,"
4777,LABOR.,And holds this theory against the world;
4778,LABOR.,And holds it well.  There is no fixedness
4779,LABOR.,Or form of politics for all mankind;
4780,LABOR.,And there is none of art.  Each artist-soul
4781,LABOR.,Is its own law; and he who dares to bring
4782,LABOR.,"From work of other man, to lay on yours,"
4783,LABOR.,His square and compass--thus declaring him
4784,LABOR.,"The pattern man--and tells, by him, you lack"
4785,LABOR.,"Just so much here, or wander so much there,"
4786,LABOR.,Thereby confesses just how much he lacks
4787,LABOR.,Of wisdom and plain sense.  For every man
4788,LABOR.,Has special gift of power and end of life.
4789,LABOR.,No man is great who lives by other law
4790,LABOR.,Than that which wrapped his genius at his birth.
4791,LABOR.,"The Lind is great because she is the Lind,"
4792,LABOR.,And not the Malibran.  Recorded art
4793,LABOR.,"Is yours to study--e'en to imitate,"
4794,LABOR.,"In education--imitate or shun,"
4795,LABOR.,"As the case warrants; but it has destroyed,"
4796,LABOR.,"Or toned to commonplace, more gifts of God"
4797,LABOR.,Than it has ever fanned to life or fed.
4798,LABOR.,Who never walks save where he sees men's tracks
4799,LABOR.,Makes no discoveries.  Show me the man
4800,LABOR.,"Who, leaving God and nature and himself,"
4801,LABOR.,"Sits at the feet of masters, stuffs his brain"
4802,LABOR.,"With maxims, notions, usages and rules,"
4803,LABOR.,"And yields his fancy up to leading-strings,"
4804,LABOR.,And I shall see a man who never did
4805,LABOR.,"A deed worth doing.  So, in the name of art--"
4806,LABOR.,"Nay, in the name of God--do no such thing"
4807,LABOR.,"As smutch your knees by bowing at a shrine,"
4808,LABOR.,"Whose doubtful deity, in midst of dust,"
4809,LABOR.,"Sits in the cast-off robes of devotees,"
4810,LABOR.,"And lives on broken victuals!"""
4811,LABOR.,
4812,LABOR.,"""Drive, my dear!"
4813,LABOR.,"Drive on, and over me!  You're on the old"
4814,LABOR.,"High-stepping horse to-night; so give him rein,"
4815,LABOR.,"For exercise is good,"" I said, in mirth."
4816,LABOR.,"""You sit your courser finely.  I confess"
4817,LABOR.,"I'm very proud of you, and too much pleased"
4818,LABOR.,With your accomplishments to check your speed.
4819,LABOR.,"Drive on, my love! drive on!"""
4820,LABOR.,
4821,LABOR.,"""I thank you, sir"
4822,LABOR.,No one so gracious as your grudging man
4823,LABOR.,Under compulsion!  With your kind consent
4824,LABOR.,"I'll ride a little further,"" she replied,--"
4825,LABOR.,"""For I enjoy it quite as much as you--"
4826,LABOR.,The more because you've given me little chance
4827,LABOR.,"In these last years....  Now, soberly, this art"
4828,LABOR.,"Of which we talk so much, without the power"
4829,LABOR.,To tell exactly what we understand
4830,LABOR.,"By the hack term--suppose we take the word,"
4831,LABOR.,And try to find its meaning.  You recall
4832,LABOR.,Old John who dressed the borders in our court:
4833,LABOR.,"You called him, hired him, told him what to do."
4834,LABOR.,He and his rake stood interposed between
4835,LABOR.,"You and your work.  You chose his skilful hands,"
4836,LABOR.,"Endowing them with pay, or pledge of pay,"
4837,LABOR.,And set him at his labor.  Now suppose
4838,LABOR.,Old John had had a philosophic turn
4839,LABOR.,"After you left him, and had thought like this:"
4840,LABOR.,'I am called here to do a certain work--
4841,LABOR.,My rake tells what; and he who called me here
4842,LABOR.,Has given me the motive for the job.
4843,LABOR.,The work is plain.  These borders are to be
4844,LABOR.,Levelled and cleaned of weeds: my hand and rake
4845,LABOR.,Are fitted for the service;--this my art;
4846,LABOR.,And it is first of all the arts.  There's none
4847,LABOR.,"More ancient, useful, worshipful, indeed,"
4848,LABOR.,Than agriculture.  Adam practised it;
4849,LABOR.,Poets have sung its praises; and the great
4850,LABOR.,Of every age have loved and honored it.
4851,LABOR.,"This art is greater than the man I serve,"
4852,LABOR.,And greater than his borders.  Therefore I
4853,LABOR.,"Will serve my art, and let the borders lie,"
4854,LABOR.,"And my employer whistle.  True to that,"
4855,LABOR.,"And to myself, it matters not to me"
4856,LABOR.,"What weeds may grow, or what the master think"
4857,LABOR.,Of my proceeding!'
4858,LABOR.,
4859,LABOR.,"""So, intent on this,"
4860,LABOR.,"He hangs his rake upon your garden wall,"
4861,LABOR.,"And steals your clematis, with which to wind"
4862,LABOR.,The handle upward; then o'erfills his hands
4863,LABOR.,"With roses and geraniums, and weaves"
4864,LABOR.,"Their beauty into laurel, for a crown"
4865,LABOR.,"For his slim god, completing his devoir"
4866,LABOR.,"By buttering the teeth, and kneeling down"
4867,LABOR.,"In abject homage.  Pray, what would you say,"
4868,LABOR.,"At close of day, when you should go to see"
4869,LABOR.,"Your untouched borders, and your gardener"
4870,LABOR.,"At genuflexion, with your mignonette"
4871,LABOR.,"In every button-hole?  Remember, now,"
4872,LABOR.,"He has been true to art and to himself,"
4873,LABOR.,According to his notion; nor forget
4874,LABOR.,"To take along a dollar for his hire,"
4875,LABOR.,"Which he expects, of course!  What would you say?"""
4876,LABOR.,
4877,LABOR.,"""Oh, don't mind that: you've reached your 'fifthly' now,"
4878,LABOR.,"And here the 'application' comes,"" I said."
4879,LABOR.,
4880,LABOR.,"""I think,"" responded she, with an arch smile,"
4881,LABOR.,"""The application's needless: but you men"
4882,LABOR.,"Are so obtuse, when will is in the way,"
4883,LABOR.,That I will do your bidding.  Every gift
4884,LABOR.,That God bestows on men holds in itself
4885,LABOR.,"The secret of its office, like the rake"
4886,LABOR.,The gardener wields.  The rake was made to till--
4887,LABOR.,"Was fashioned, head and handle, for just that;"
4888,LABOR.,"And if, by grace of God, you hold a gift"
4889,LABOR.,"So fashioned and adapted, that it stands"
4890,LABOR.,In like relation of supremest use
4891,LABOR.,"To life of men, the office of your gift"
4892,LABOR.,Has perfect definition.  Gift like this
4893,LABOR.,"Is yours, my husband.  In your facile hands"
4894,LABOR.,"God placed it for the service of himself,"
4895,LABOR.,"In service of your kind.  Taking this gift,"
4896,LABOR.,"And using it for God and for the world,"
4897,LABOR.,"In your own way, and in your own best way;"
4898,LABOR.,Seeking for light and knowledge everywhere
4899,LABOR.,To guide your careful hand; and opening wide
4900,LABOR.,"To spiritual influx all your soul,"
4901,LABOR.,"That so your master may breathe into you,"
4902,LABOR.,"And breathe his great life through you, in such forms"
4903,LABOR.,Of pure presentment as he gives you skill
4904,LABOR.,To build withal--that's all of art--for you.
4905,LABOR.,"Art is an instrument, and not an end--"
4906,LABOR.,"A servant, not a master, nor a God"
4907,LABOR.,To be bowed down to.  Shall we worship rakes?
4908,LABOR.,"Honor of art, by him whose work is art,"
4909,LABOR.,Is a fine passion; but he honors most
4910,LABOR.,"Whose use and end are best."""
4911,LABOR.,
4912,LABOR.,"""Use!  Use!  Use!"""
4913,LABOR.,"I cried impatiently;--""nothing but use!"
4914,LABOR.,"As if God never made a violet,"
4915,LABOR.,"Or hung a harebell, or in kindling gold"
4916,LABOR.,"Garnished a sunset, or upreared the arch"
4917,LABOR.,"Of a bright rainbow, or endowed a world--"
4918,LABOR.,"A universe, indeed--stars, firmament,"
4919,LABOR.,"The vastitudes of forest and of sea,"
4920,LABOR.,"Swift brooks and sweeping rivers, virid meads"
4921,LABOR.,And fluff of breezy hills--with tints that range
4922,LABOR.,"The scale of spectral beauty, till they leave"
4923,LABOR.,No glint or glory of the changeful light
4924,LABOR.,Without a revelation!  Is this use--
4925,LABOR.,"I beg your pardon, love: you say 'this art'--"
4926,LABOR.,"The sum and end of art?  If it be so,"
4927,LABOR.,Then God's no artist.  Are the crystal brooks
4928,LABOR.,Sweeter for singing to the thirsty brutes
4929,LABOR.,That dip their beaded muzzles in the foam?
4930,LABOR.,Burns the tree better that its leaves are green?
4931,LABOR.,Sleeps the sun sounder under canopy
4932,LABOR.,"Of gold or rose?"""
4933,LABOR.,
4934,LABOR.,"""Yet beauty has its use,"""
4935,LABOR.,"Responded she.  ""Whatever elevates"
4936,LABOR.,"Inspires, refreshes, any human soul,"
4937,LABOR.,Is useful to that soul.  Beauty has use
4938,LABOR.,For you and me.  The dainty violet
4939,LABOR.,"Blooms in our thought, and sheds its fragrance there"
4940,LABOR.,And we are gainers through its ministry.
4941,LABOR.,All God's great values wear the drapery
4942,LABOR.,"That most becomes them.  Beauty may, in truth,"
4943,LABOR.,Be incident of art and not be end--
4944,LABOR.,"Its form, condition, features, dress, and still"
4945,LABOR.,The humblest value of the things of art.
4946,LABOR.,This truth obtains in all God's artistry.
4947,LABOR.,"Does God make beauty for himself, alone?"
4948,LABOR.,"He is, and holds, all beauty.  Has he need"
4949,LABOR.,To kindle rushes that he may behold
4950,LABOR.,The glory of his thoughts? or need to use
4951,LABOR.,His thoughts as plasms for the amorphous clay
4952,LABOR.,That he may study models?  For an end
4953,LABOR.,"Outside himself, he ever speaks himself;"
4954,LABOR.,"And end, with him, is use."""
4955,LABOR.,
4956,LABOR.,"""Well, I confess"
4957,LABOR.,"There's truth in what you utter,"" I replied;--"
4958,LABOR.,"""A modicum of truth, at least; and still"
4959,LABOR.,There's something more which this our subtle talk
4960,LABOR.,Has failed to give us.  I will not affirm
4961,LABOR.,"That art, recorded in its thousand forms,"
4962,LABOR.,"And clothed with usages, traditions, rules,--"
4963,LABOR.,The thing of history--the mighty pile
4964,LABOR.,Of drift that sweep of ages has brought down
4965,LABOR.,To heap the puzzled present--is the sum
4966,LABOR.,And substance of all art.  I will not claim--
4967,LABOR.,"Nay, mark me now--I will not even claim"
4968,LABOR.,"That beauty is art's end, or has its end"
4969,LABOR.,Within itself.  Our tedious colloquy
4970,LABOR.,"Has cleared away the rubbish from my thought,"
4971,LABOR.,And given me cleaner vision.  I can see
4972,LABOR.,"Before, around me, underneath, above,"
4973,LABOR.,The great unrealized; and while I bow
4974,LABOR.,"To the traditions and the things of art,"
4975,LABOR.,"And hold my theories, I find myself"
4976,LABOR.,Inspired supremely by the Possible
4977,LABOR.,That calls for revelation--by the forms
4978,LABOR.,That sleep imprisoned in the snowy arms
4979,LABOR.,"Of still unquarried truth, or stretch their hands"
4980,LABOR.,"At sound of sledge and drill and booming fire,"
4981,LABOR.,"Imploring for release.  I turn from men,"
4982,LABOR.,And stretch my hands toward these.  I feel--I know--
4983,LABOR.,"That there are mighty myriads waiting there,"
4984,LABOR.,And listening for my steps.  Suppose my age
4985,LABOR.,"Should fail to give them welcome: ay, suppose"
4986,LABOR.,They may not help a man to coin a dime
4987,LABOR.,Or cook a dinner: they will fare as well
4988,LABOR.,"As much of God's truth fares, though clothed in forms"
4989,LABOR.,Divinely chosen.  Does God ever stint
4990,LABOR.,His utterance because no creature hears?
4991,LABOR.,"Is it a grand and goodly thing, to spend"
4992,LABOR.,Brave life and precious treasure in a search
4993,LABOR.,"For palpitating water at the pole,"
4994,LABOR.,"That so the sum of knowledge may be swelled,"
4995,LABOR.,Though pearls are not increased; and something less
4996,LABOR.,"To probe the Possible in art, or sit"
4997,LABOR.,Through months of dreary dark to catch a glimpse
4998,LABOR.,Of the live truth that quivers with the jar
4999,LABOR.,Of movement at its axle?  Is it good
5000,LABOR.,"To garner gain beyond the present need,"
5001,LABOR.,Won by excursive commerce in all seas;
5002,LABOR.,And something less to pile redundantly
5003,LABOR.,"The spoil of thought?"""
5004,LABOR.,
5005,LABOR.,"""These latest words of yours,"""
5006,LABOR.,"She answered musingly, ""impress me much;"
5007,LABOR.,"And yet, I think I see where they will lead,"
5008,LABOR.,"Or, rather, fail to lead.  Your fantasy"
5009,LABOR.,Is beautiful but vague.  The Possible
5010,LABOR.,"Is a vast ocean, from which one poor soul,"
5011,LABOR.,"With its slight oars, can float but flimsy freight;"
5012,LABOR.,"Yet I would help your courage, for I see"
5013,LABOR.,"Where your sole motive lies.  Go on, and prove"
5014,LABOR.,Whether your scheme or mine holds more of good;
5015,LABOR.,"And take my blessing with you."""
5016,LABOR.,
5017,LABOR.,"Then she rose,"
5018,LABOR.,"And kissed my forehead.  Looking in her face,"
5019,LABOR.,"By the sharp light that touched her, I was thrilled"
5020,LABOR.,By her flushed cheeks and strangely lustrous eyes.
5021,LABOR.,She spoke not; but I heard the sigh she breathed--
5022,LABOR.,"The long-drawn, weary sigh--as she retired;"
5023,LABOR.,"And then the Possible, which had inspired"
5024,LABOR.,"So wondrously my hope, drooped low around,"
5025,LABOR.,And filled me with foreboding.
5026,LABOR.,
5027,LABOR.,Had her life
5028,LABOR.,Been chilled by my neglect?  Was it on wane?
5029,LABOR.,"Could she be lost to me?  Oh! then I felt,"
5030,LABOR.,"As I had never felt before, how mean"
5031,LABOR.,Beside one true affection is the best
5032,LABOR.,"Of all earth's prizes, and how little worth"
5033,LABOR.,The world would be without her love--herself!
5034,LABOR.,
5035,LABOR.,"But sleep refreshed her, and next morn she sat"
5036,LABOR.,"At our bright board, in her accustomed place;"
5037,LABOR.,"And sunlight was not sweeter than her smile,"
5038,LABOR.,Or cheerfuller.  My quick fears died away;
5039,LABOR.,And though I saw that she had lost the fire
5040,LABOR.,"Of her young life, I comforted myself"
5041,LABOR.,With thinking that it was the same with me--
5042,LABOR.,The sure result of years.
5043,LABOR.,
5044,LABOR.,My time I gave
5045,LABOR.,"To my new passion, rioting at large"
5046,LABOR.,In the fresh realm of fancy and of thought
5047,LABOR.,"To which the passion bore me, and from which"
5048,LABOR.,I strove to gather for embodiment
5049,LABOR.,Material of art.
5050,LABOR.,
5051,LABOR.,"The more I dreamed,"
5052,LABOR.,The broader grew my dream.  The further on
5053,LABOR.,"My footsteps pushed, the brighter grew the light;"
5054,LABOR.,"Till, half in terror, half in reverence,"
5055,LABOR.,I learned that I had broached the Infinite!
5056,LABOR.,I had not thought my Possible could bear
5057,LABOR.,"Such name as this, or wear such attribute;"
5058,LABOR.,And shrank befitting distance from the front
5059,LABOR.,"Of awful secrets, hid in awful flame,"
5060,LABOR.,That scorched and scared me.
5061,LABOR.,
5062,LABOR.,"So, more humble grown,"
5063,LABOR.,"And less adventurous, I chose, at last,"
5064,LABOR.,"My theme and vehicle of song, and wrote."
5065,LABOR.,"My faculties, grown strong and keen by use,"
5066,LABOR.,"Bent to their task with earnest faithfulness,"
5067,LABOR.,And glowed with high endeavor.  All of power
5068,LABOR.,I had within me flowed into my hand;
5069,LABOR.,"And learning, language--all my life's resource--"
5070,LABOR.,"Lay close around my enterprise, and poured"
5071,LABOR.,Their hoarded wealth of imagery and words
5072,LABOR.,"Faster than I could use it.  For long weeks,"
5073,LABOR.,"My ardent labor crowded all my days,"
5074,LABOR.,"Invaded sleep, and haunted e'en my dreams:"
5075,LABOR.,And then the work was done.
5076,LABOR.,
5077,LABOR.,"I left it there,"
5078,LABOR.,And sought for recreative rest in scenes
5079,LABOR.,That once had charmed me--in society
5080,LABOR.,Where I was welcome: but the common talk
5081,LABOR.,Of daily news--of politics and trade--
5082,LABOR.,Was senseless as the chatter of the jays
5083,LABOR.,In autumn forests.  No refreshing balm
5084,LABOR.,Came to me in the sympathy of men.
5085,LABOR.,"In my retirement, I had left the world"
5086,LABOR.,"To go its way; and it had gone its way,"
5087,LABOR.,And left me hopelessly.
5088,LABOR.,
5089,LABOR.,I told my wife
5090,LABOR.,"Of my dissatisfaction and disgust,"
5091,LABOR.,But found small comfort in her words.  She said:
5092,LABOR.,"""The world is wide, and woman's vision short;"
5093,LABOR.,But I have never seen a man who turned
5094,LABOR.,"His efforts from his kind, and failed to spoil"
5095,LABOR.,"All men for him--himself, indeed, for them;"
5096,LABOR.,And he who gives nor sympathy nor aid
5097,LABOR.,To the poor race from which he seeks such boon
5098,LABOR.,Must be rejoiced if it be generous;
5099,LABOR.,"Content, if it be just.  Society"
5100,LABOR.,Is a grand scheme of service and return.
5101,LABOR.,"We give and take; and he who gives the most,"
5102,LABOR.,"In ways directest, wins the best reward."""
5103,LABOR.,
5104,LABOR.,"By purpose, I closed eyes upon my work"
5105,LABOR.,"For many weeks, resisting every day"
5106,LABOR.,The impulse to review the glowing dream
5107,LABOR.,My fancy had engendered: for I wished
5108,LABOR.,To go with faculty and fancy cooled
5109,LABOR.,"To its perusal.  I had strong desire,"
5110,LABOR.,"So far as in me lay, to see the work"
5111,LABOR.,"With the world's eyes, for reasons--ah!  I shrink"
5112,LABOR.,"From writing them!  All men are sometimes weak,"
5113,LABOR.,And some are inconsistent with their wills.
5114,LABOR.,"If I were one of these, think not I failed"
5115,LABOR.,"To justify my weakness to myself,"
5116,LABOR.,In ways that saved my pride.
5117,LABOR.,
5118,LABOR.,Yet this was true;
5119,LABOR.,I had an honest wish to learn how far
5120,LABOR.,My work of heat had power to re-inspire
5121,LABOR.,"The soul that wrought it, and how well my verse"
5122,LABOR.,Had clothed and kept the creature of my thought;
5123,LABOR.,For memory still retained the loveliness
5124,LABOR.,That filled the fresh conceit.
5125,LABOR.,
5126,LABOR.,"When, in good time."
5127,LABOR.,"Rest and diversion had performed their work,"
5128,LABOR.,"And the long fever of my brain was gone,"
5129,LABOR.,"I broached my feast, first making fast my door."
5130,LABOR.,That so no eye should mark my greedy joy
5131,LABOR.,"Or my grimaces,--doubtful of the fate"
5132,LABOR.,That waited expectation.
5133,LABOR.,
5134,LABOR.,It were vain
5135,LABOR.,"To try, in these tame words, to paint the pang,"
5136,LABOR.,"The faintness and the chill, which overwhelmed"
5137,LABOR.,My disappointed heart.  My welded thoughts
5138,LABOR.,"Which, in their whitest heat, had bent and bound"
5139,LABOR.,"My language to themselves, imparting grace"
5140,LABOR.,"To stiffest words, and meanings fresh and fine"
5141,LABOR.,"To simplest phrases, interfusing all"
5142,LABOR.,"With their own ardency, and shining through"
5143,LABOR.,"With smoothly rounded beauty, lay in heaps"
5144,LABOR.,"Of cold, unmeaning ugliness.  My words"
5145,LABOR.,"Had shrunk to old proportions, and stood out"
5146,LABOR.,"In hard, stiff angles, challenging a guess"
5147,LABOR.,Of what they covered.
5148,LABOR.,
5149,LABOR.,"Meaningless to me,"
5150,LABOR.,Who knew the meaning that had once informed
5151,LABOR.,"Its faithless numbers, what way could I hope"
5152,LABOR.,"That, to my own, or any future age,"
5153,LABOR.,My work should speak its full significance?
5154,LABOR.,"My latest child, begot in manly joy,"
5155,LABOR.,"Conceived in purity, and born in toil,"
5156,LABOR.,"Lay dead before me,--dead, and in the shroud"
5157,LABOR.,My hopeful hands had woven and bedecked
5158,LABOR.,To be its chrisom.
5159,LABOR.,
5160,LABOR.,Then the first I learned
5161,LABOR.,Where language finds its bound--learned that beyond
5162,LABOR.,"The range of human commerce, save by force,"
5163,LABOR.,"It never moves, nor lingers in the realm"
5164,LABOR.,"It thus invades, a moment, if the voice"
5165,LABOR.,Of human commerce speak not the demand;--
5166,LABOR.,That language is a thing of use;--that thought
5167,LABOR.,"Which seeks a revelation, first must seek"
5168,LABOR.,"Adjustment in the scale of human need,"
5169,LABOR.,Or find no fitting vehicle.
5170,LABOR.,
5171,LABOR.,And more:
5172,LABOR.,That the great Possible which lies outside
5173,LABOR.,The range of commerce is identical
5174,LABOR.,"With the stupendous Infinite of God,"
5175,LABOR.,"Which only comes in glimpses, or in hints"
5176,LABOR.,"Of vague significance, so dim, so vast,"
5177,LABOR.,"That subtlest, most prehensile language, shrinks"
5178,LABOR.,"From plucking of its robes, the while they sweep"
5179,LABOR.,The perfumed air!
5180,LABOR.,
5181,LABOR.,"I closed my manuscript,"
5182,LABOR.,"And locked it in my desk.  Then stealing forth,"
5183,LABOR.,"I sought the bustle of the street, to drown"
5184,LABOR.,"In the great roar of careless toil, the pain"
5185,LABOR.,That brings despair.  My last resource was gone;
5186,LABOR.,And as I brooded o'er the awful blank
5187,LABOR.,"Of hopeless life that waited for my steps,"
5188,LABOR.,A fear which I had feared to entertain
5189,LABOR.,"Found entrance to my heart, and held it still,"
5190,LABOR.,Almost to bursting.
5191,LABOR.,
5192,LABOR.,Not alone my life
5193,LABOR.,"Was sliding from me; for my better life,"
5194,LABOR.,"My pearl of price, the jewel in my crown,"
5195,LABOR.,"My wife Kathrina, growing lovelier"
5196,LABOR.,"With every passing day, arose each morn"
5197,LABOR.,"From wasting dreams to paler loveliness,"
5198,LABOR.,"And sank in growing weariness each night,"
5199,LABOR.,"And hotter hectic, to her welcome bed."
5200,LABOR.,"Her bed!  The sweet, the precious nuptial bed!"
5201,LABOR.,Bed sanctified by love!  Bed blest of God
5202,LABOR.,With fruit immortal!  Bed too soon to be
5203,LABOR.,Crowned with the glory of a Christian death!
5204,LABOR.,"Ah God!  How it brought back the agony,"
5205,LABOR.,And the rebellious hate of other years--
5206,LABOR.,The hopeless struggle of my will with Him
5207,LABOR.,Whose will is law!
5208,LABOR.,
5209,LABOR.,Thus torn with mingled thought:
5210,LABOR.,"Of fear, despair and spite, I wore away"
5211,LABOR.,"Miles of wild wandering about the streets,"
5212,LABOR.,Till weariness at last compelled my feet
5213,LABOR.,To drag me to my home.
5214,LABOR.,
5215,LABOR.,Before my door
5216,LABOR.,Stood the familiar chair of one whose call
5217,LABOR.,Was ominous of ill.  My heart grew sick
5218,LABOR.,With flutter of foreboding and foredoom;
5219,LABOR.,"But in swift silence I flew up the steps,"
5220,LABOR.,"And, blind with stifled frenzy, reached the side"
5221,LABOR.,"Of my poor wife.  She smiled at seeing me,"
5222,LABOR.,"But I could only kneel, and bathe her hands"
5223,LABOR.,With tears and kisses.  In her gentle breast--
5224,LABOR.,"True home of love, and love and home to me--"
5225,LABOR.,"The blood had burst its walls, and flowed in flame"
5226,LABOR.,From lips it left in ashes.
5227,LABOR.,
5228,LABOR.,In her smile
5229,LABOR.,"Of perfect trustfulness, I caught first glimpse"
5230,LABOR.,Of that aureola of fadeless light
5231,LABOR.,"Which spans my lonely couch, and kindles hope"
5232,LABOR.,"That when my time shall come to follow her,"
5233,LABOR.,"My spirit may go out, enwreathed and wrapped"

5241,DESPAIR.,
5242,DESPAIR.,Ah! what is so dead as a perished delight!
5243,DESPAIR.,Or a passion outlived! or a scheme overthrown!
5244,DESPAIR.,"Save the bankrupt heart it has left in its flight,"
5245,DESPAIR.,"Still as quick as the eye, but as cold as a stone!"
5246,DESPAIR.,
5247,DESPAIR.,"The honey-bee hoards for its winter-long need,"
5248,DESPAIR.,The treasure it gathers in joy from the flowers;
5249,DESPAIR.,And drinks in each sip of its silvery mead
5250,DESPAIR.,The flavor and flush of the sweet summer hours.
5251,DESPAIR.,
5252,DESPAIR.,But a pleasure expires at its earliest breath:
5253,DESPAIR.,"No labor can hoard it, no cunning can save;"
5254,DESPAIR.,"For the song of its life is the sigh of its death,"
5255,DESPAIR.,And the sense it has thrilled is its shroud and its grave.
5256,DESPAIR.,
5257,DESPAIR.,"Ah! what is our love, with its tincture of lust,"
5258,DESPAIR.,"And its pleasure that pains us and pain that endears,"
5259,DESPAIR.,But joy in an armful of beautiful dust
5260,DESPAIR.,"That crumbles, and flies on the wings of the years?"
5261,DESPAIR.,
5262,DESPAIR.,"And what is ambition for glory and power,"
5263,DESPAIR.,But desire to be reckoned the uppermost fool
5264,DESPAIR.,"Of a million of fools, for a pitiful hour,"
5265,DESPAIR.,"And be cursed for a tyrant, or kicked for a tool?"
5266,DESPAIR.,
5267,DESPAIR.,"Nay, what is the noblest that art can achieve,"
5268,DESPAIR.,"But to conjure a vision of light to the eyes,"
5269,DESPAIR.,"That will pale ere we paint it, and pall ere we leave"
5270,DESPAIR.,On the heart it betrays and the hand it defies?
5271,DESPAIR.,
5272,DESPAIR.,"We love, and we long with an infinite greed"
5273,DESPAIR.,"For a love that will fill our deep longing, in vain;"
5274,DESPAIR.,"The cup that we drink of is pleasant, indeed,"
5275,DESPAIR.,Yet it holds but a drop of the heavenly rain.
5276,DESPAIR.,
5277,DESPAIR.,We plan for our powers the divinest we can;
5278,DESPAIR.,We do with our powers the supremest we may;

5287,DESPAIR.,The maid sings of love to the hum of her wheel;
5288,DESPAIR.,And her lover responds as he follows his team;
5289,DESPAIR.,"They wed, and their children come quickly to seal"
5290,DESPAIR.,In fulfilment the pledge of their loftiest dream.
5291,DESPAIR.,
5292,DESPAIR.,"With humblest ambitions and homeliest fare,"
5293,DESPAIR.,"Contented, though toiling, they travel abreast,"
5294,DESPAIR.,"Till the kind hand of death lifts their burden of care,"
5295,DESPAIR.,"And they sink, in the faith of their fathers, to rest."
5296,DESPAIR.,
5297,DESPAIR.,Did I beg to be born?  Did I seek to exist?
5298,DESPAIR.,Did I bargain for promptings to loftier gains?
5299,DESPAIR.,"Did I ask for a brain, with contempt of the fist"
5300,DESPAIR.,That could win a reward for its labor and pains?
5301,DESPAIR.,
5302,DESPAIR.,Was it kind--the strong promise that girded my youth?
5303,DESPAIR.,Was it good--the endowment of motive and skill?
5304,DESPAIR.,"Was it well to succeed, when success was, in truth,"
5305,DESPAIR.,"But the saddest of failure?  Make answer, who will!"

5311,DESPAIR.,
5312,DESPAIR.,"Oh! emptiness!  Life, what art thou but a lie,"
5313,DESPAIR.,Which I greeted and honored with hopefullest trust?
5314,DESPAIR.,Bah! the beautiful apples that tempted my eye
5315,DESPAIR.,Break dead on my tongue into ashes and dust!
5316,DESPAIR.,
5317,DESPAIR.,"""A Father who loves all the children of men""?"
5318,DESPAIR.,"""A future to fill all these bottomless gaps""?"
5319,DESPAIR.,But one life has failed: can I fasten again
5320,DESPAIR.,With my faith and my hope to a specious Perhaps!
5321,DESPAIR.,
5322,DESPAIR.,O! man who begot me!  O! woman who bore!
5323,DESPAIR.,"Why, why did you call me to being and breath?"
5324,DESPAIR.,"With ruin behind me, and darkness before,"

5334,CONSUMMATION.,A guest was in my house--a guest unbid--
5335,CONSUMMATION.,"Who stayed without a welcome from his host,--"
5336,CONSUMMATION.,"So loathed and hated, on such errand bent,"
5337,CONSUMMATION.,"And armed with such resistless power of ill,"
5338,CONSUMMATION.,I dared not look him in the face.  I heard
5339,CONSUMMATION.,"His tireless footsteps in the lonely halls,"
5340,CONSUMMATION.,"In the chill hours of night; and, in the day,"
5341,CONSUMMATION.,"They climbed the stairs, or loitered through the rooms"
5342,CONSUMMATION.,With lawless freedom.  Ever when I turned
5343,CONSUMMATION.,I caught a glimpse of him.  His shadow stalked
5344,CONSUMMATION.,"Between me and the light, and fled before"
5345,CONSUMMATION.,"My restless feet, or followed close behind."
5346,CONSUMMATION.,Whene'er I bent above the couch that held
5347,CONSUMMATION.,"My fading wife, though looking not, I knew"
5348,CONSUMMATION.,"That he was bending from the other side,"
5349,CONSUMMATION.,And mocking me.
5350,CONSUMMATION.,
5351,CONSUMMATION.,"Familiar grown, at last,"
5352,CONSUMMATION.,He came more closely--came and sat with me
5353,CONSUMMATION.,"Through hours of revery; or, as I paced"
5354,CONSUMMATION.,"My dimly-lighted room, slipped his lank arm"
5355,CONSUMMATION.,"Through mine, and whispered in my shrinking ear"
5356,CONSUMMATION.,Such fearful words as made me sick and cold.
5357,CONSUMMATION.,"He took the vacant station at my board,"
5358,CONSUMMATION.,"Sitting where she had sat, and mixed my cup"
5359,CONSUMMATION.,"With poisoned waters, saying in low tones"
5360,CONSUMMATION.,That none but I could hear:
5361,CONSUMMATION.,
5362,CONSUMMATION.,"""This little room,"
5363,CONSUMMATION.,"Where you have breakfasted and dined and supped,"
5364,CONSUMMATION.,"And laughed and chatted in the days gone by,"
5365,CONSUMMATION.,Will be a lonely place when we are gone.
5366,CONSUMMATION.,"Those roses at the window, that were wont"
5367,CONSUMMATION.,"To bloom so freely with the lady's care,"
5368,CONSUMMATION.,Already miss her touch.  That ivy-vine
5369,CONSUMMATION.,"Has grown a yard since it was tied, and needs"
5370,CONSUMMATION.,"A training hand."""
5371,CONSUMMATION.,
5372,CONSUMMATION.,Rising with bitter tears
5373,CONSUMMATION.,"To flee his presence, he arose with me,"
5374,CONSUMMATION.,And wandered through the rooms.
5375,CONSUMMATION.,
5376,CONSUMMATION.,"""This casket here""--"
5377,CONSUMMATION.,"I heard him say: ""Suppose we loose the clasp."
5378,CONSUMMATION.,These are her jewels--pretty gifts of yours.
5379,CONSUMMATION.,There is a diamond: there a string of pearls.
5380,CONSUMMATION.,That paly opal holds a mellowed fire
5381,CONSUMMATION.,"Which minds me of the mistress, whose bright soul,"
5382,CONSUMMATION.,Glows through the lucent whiteness of her face
5383,CONSUMMATION.,With lambent flicker.  These are legacies:
5384,CONSUMMATION.,She will not wear them more.  Her taste and mine
5385,CONSUMMATION.,"Are one in this, that both of us love flowers."
5386,CONSUMMATION.,"Ay, she shall have them, too, some pleasant day,"
5387,CONSUMMATION.,When she goes forth with me!
5388,CONSUMMATION.,
5389,CONSUMMATION.,"""So? what is this?"
5390,CONSUMMATION.,Her wardrobe!  Let the door be opened wide!
5391,CONSUMMATION.,"This musk, so blent with scent of violets,"
5392,CONSUMMATION.,Revives one.  You remember when she wore
5393,CONSUMMATION.,That lavender?--a very pretty silk!
5394,CONSUMMATION.,Here is a _moire antique_.  Ah! yes--I see!
5395,CONSUMMATION.,"You did not like her in it.  'Twas too old,"
5396,CONSUMMATION.,And too suggestive of the dowager.
5397,CONSUMMATION.,There is your favorite--that glossy blue--
5398,CONSUMMATION.,The sweet tint stolen from the skies of June--
5399,CONSUMMATION.,But she is done with it.  I wonder who
5400,CONSUMMATION.,"Will wear it, when your grief shall find a pause!"
5401,CONSUMMATION.,"Your daughter--possibly? ... You shiver, sir!"
5402,CONSUMMATION.,"Is it the velvet?  Like a pall, you think!"
5403,CONSUMMATION.,"Well, close the door!"
5404,CONSUMMATION.,
5405,CONSUMMATION.,"""Those slippers on the rug:"
5406,CONSUMMATION.,The time will come when you will kiss their soles
5407,CONSUMMATION.,For the dear life that pressed them.  Their rosettes
5408,CONSUMMATION.,Will be more redolent than roses then.
5409,CONSUMMATION.,You did not know how much you loved your wife?
5410,CONSUMMATION.,I thought so!
5411,CONSUMMATION.,
5412,CONSUMMATION.,"""This way!  Let us take our stand"
5413,CONSUMMATION.,Beside her bed.  Not quite so beautiful
5414,CONSUMMATION.,"To your fond eyes as when she was a bride,"
5415,CONSUMMATION.,Though still a lovely woman!  Seems it strange
5416,CONSUMMATION.,That she is yours no longer?--that her hand
5417,CONSUMMATION.,Is given to another--to the one
5418,CONSUMMATION.,"For whom she has been waiting all her life,"
5419,CONSUMMATION.,And ready all her life?  Your power is gone
5420,CONSUMMATION.,"To punish rivals.  There you stand and weep,"
5421,CONSUMMATION.,"But dare not lift a finger, while with smiles"
5422,CONSUMMATION.,And kindly welcome she extends her hands
5423,CONSUMMATION.,To greet her long-expected friend.  She knows
5424,CONSUMMATION.,"Where I will take her--to what city of God,"
5425,CONSUMMATION.,"What palace there, and what companionship."
5426,CONSUMMATION.,"She knows what robes will drape her loveliness,"
5427,CONSUMMATION.,"What flowers bedeck her hair, and rise and fall"
5428,CONSUMMATION.,Upon the pulses of her happy breast.
5429,CONSUMMATION.,"And you, poor man! with all your jealous pride,"
5430,CONSUMMATION.,"Have learned that she would turn again to you,"
5431,CONSUMMATION.,"And to your food and furniture of life,"
5432,CONSUMMATION.,With disappointment.
5433,CONSUMMATION.,
5434,CONSUMMATION.,"""Ay, she pities you--"
5435,CONSUMMATION.,"Loves you, indeed; but there is One she loves"
5436,CONSUMMATION.,"With holier passion, and with more entire"
5437,CONSUMMATION.,And gladder self-surrender.  She will go--
5438,CONSUMMATION.,You know that she will go--and go with joy;
5439,CONSUMMATION.,"And you begin to see how poor and mean,"
5440,CONSUMMATION.,"When placed beside her joy, are all your gifts,"
5441,CONSUMMATION.,And all that you have won by them.
5442,CONSUMMATION.,
5443,CONSUMMATION.,"""Poor man!"
5444,CONSUMMATION.,"Weeping again!  Well, if it comfort you,"
5445,CONSUMMATION.,"Rain your salt tears upon her waxen hands,"
5446,CONSUMMATION.,"And kiss them dry at leisure!  Press her lips,"
5447,CONSUMMATION.,"Hot with the hectic!  Lay your cold, wet cheek"
5448,CONSUMMATION.,Against the burning scarlet of her own:
5449,CONSUMMATION.,"Only remember that she is not yours,"
5450,CONSUMMATION.,And that your paroxysms of grief and tears
5451,CONSUMMATION.,"Are painful to her."""
5452,CONSUMMATION.,
5453,CONSUMMATION.,Ah! to wait for death!
5454,CONSUMMATION.,To see one's idol with the signature
5455,CONSUMMATION.,Of the Destroyer stamped upon her brow.
5456,CONSUMMATION.,"And know that she is doomed, beyond all hope;"
5457,CONSUMMATION.,To watch her while she fades; to see the form
5458,CONSUMMATION.,That once was Beauty's own become a corpse
5459,CONSUMMATION.,"In all but breathing, and to meet her eyes"
5460,CONSUMMATION.,A hundred times a day--while the heart bleeds--
5461,CONSUMMATION.,"With smiles of smooth dissembling, and with words"
5462,CONSUMMATION.,"Cheerful as morning, and to do all this"
5463,CONSUMMATION.,"Through weeks and weary months, till one half longs"
5464,CONSUMMATION.,"To see the spell dissolved, and feel the worst"
5465,CONSUMMATION.,That death can do: can there be misery
5466,CONSUMMATION.,Sadder than this?
5467,CONSUMMATION.,
5468,CONSUMMATION.,"My time I passed alone,"
5469,CONSUMMATION.,And at the bedside of my dying wife.
5470,CONSUMMATION.,"She talked of death as children talk of sleep,"
5471,CONSUMMATION.,When--a forgetful blank--it lies between
5472,CONSUMMATION.,Their glad impatience and a holiday.
5473,CONSUMMATION.,The morrow--ah! the morrow!  That was name
5474,CONSUMMATION.,"For hope all realized, for work all done,"
5475,CONSUMMATION.,"For pain all passed, for life and strength renewed."
5476,CONSUMMATION.,"For fruitage of endeavor, for repose,"
5477,CONSUMMATION.,For heaven!
5478,CONSUMMATION.,
5479,CONSUMMATION.,What would the morrow bring to me?
5480,CONSUMMATION.,The morrow--ah! the morrow!  It was blank--
5481,CONSUMMATION.,"Nay, blank and black with gloom of clouds and night"
5482,CONSUMMATION.,Never before had I so realized
5483,CONSUMMATION.,My helplessness.  I could not find relief
5484,CONSUMMATION.,"In love or labor.  I could only sit,"
5485,CONSUMMATION.,"And gaze against a wall, without the power"
5486,CONSUMMATION.,To pierce or climb.  My pride of life was gone.
5487,CONSUMMATION.,"My spirit broken, and my strife with God"
5488,CONSUMMATION.,"Was finished.  If I could not look before,"
5489,CONSUMMATION.,"I dare not look above; and so, whene'er"
5490,CONSUMMATION.,"I could forget the present, I went back"
5491,CONSUMMATION.,Upon the past.
5492,CONSUMMATION.,
5493,CONSUMMATION.,"One soft June day, my thoughts,"
5494,CONSUMMATION.,"Touched by some song of bird, or glimpse of green,"
5495,CONSUMMATION.,"Returned to life's bright morning, and the Junes"
5496,CONSUMMATION.,That flooded with their wealth of life and song
5497,CONSUMMATION.,"The valley of my birth.  Again I walked the meads,"
5498,CONSUMMATION.,"Brilliant with beaded grass, and heard the shrill,"
5499,CONSUMMATION.,Sweet jargon of the meadow-birds.  Again
5500,CONSUMMATION.,"I trod the forest paths, in shade of trees"
5501,CONSUMMATION.,With foliage so tender that the sun
5502,CONSUMMATION.,"Shot through the soft, thin leaves its virid sheen,"
5503,CONSUMMATION.,As through the emerald waters of the sea.
5504,CONSUMMATION.,"The scarlet tanager--a flake of fire,"
5505,CONSUMMATION.,Blown from the tropic heats upon the breath
5506,CONSUMMATION.,"That brought the summer--caught upon a twig,"
5507,CONSUMMATION.,Or quenched its glow in some remote recess.
5508,CONSUMMATION.,The springing ferns unfolded at my feet
5509,CONSUMMATION.,"Their tan-brown scrolls, the tiny star-flower shone"
5510,CONSUMMATION.,Among its leaves; the insects filled the air
5511,CONSUMMATION.,"With a monotonous, reedy resonance"
5512,CONSUMMATION.,"Of whir and hum, and I sat down again"
5513,CONSUMMATION.,"Upon a bank, to gather violets."
5514,CONSUMMATION.,
5515,CONSUMMATION.,From dreams of retrospective joy I woke
5516,CONSUMMATION.,"At last, to the quick tinkle of a bell."
5517,CONSUMMATION.,"My wife had touched it.  She had been asleep,"
5518,CONSUMMATION.,"And, waking, called me to her side.  The note,"
5519,CONSUMMATION.,"Familiar as the murmur of her voice,"
5520,CONSUMMATION.,"For the first time was strange.  Another bell,"
5521,CONSUMMATION.,"With other music, ran adown the years"
5522,CONSUMMATION.,That lay between me and the golden day
5523,CONSUMMATION.,"When, up the mountain-path, I followed far"
5524,CONSUMMATION.,The lamb that bore it.  All the scene came back
5525,CONSUMMATION.,In a broad flash; and with it came the same
5526,CONSUMMATION.,Strange apprehension of a mighty change--
5527,CONSUMMATION.,"A vague prevision of transition, born"
5528,CONSUMMATION.,"Of what, I knew not; on what errand sent,"
5529,CONSUMMATION.,I could not guess.
5530,CONSUMMATION.,
5531,CONSUMMATION.,"I rose upon my feet,"
5532,CONSUMMATION.,"Responsive to the summons, when I heard,"
5533,CONSUMMATION.,"Repeated in the ear of memory,"
5534,CONSUMMATION.,The words my mother spoke to me that day:
5535,CONSUMMATION.,
5536,CONSUMMATION.,"""My Paul has climbed the noblest mountain-height"
5537,CONSUMMATION.,"In all his little world, and gazed on scenes"
5538,CONSUMMATION.,As beautiful as rest beneath the sun.
5539,CONSUMMATION.,I trust he will remember all his life
5540,CONSUMMATION.,"That, to his best achievement, and the spot"
5541,CONSUMMATION.,"Closest to heaven his youthful feet have trod,"
5542,CONSUMMATION.,He has been guided by a guileless lamb.
5543,CONSUMMATION.,It is an omen which his mother's heart
5544,CONSUMMATION.,"Will treasure with her jewels."""
5545,CONSUMMATION.,
5546,CONSUMMATION.,Had her tongue
5547,CONSUMMATION.,Been moved to prophecy?  Omen of what?--
5548,CONSUMMATION.,Of a new height of life to be achieved
5549,CONSUMMATION.,"By my lamb's leading?  Ay, it seemed like this!"
5550,CONSUMMATION.,"An answer to a thousand prayers, up-breathed"
5551,CONSUMMATION.,"By her whom I had lost, repeated long"
5552,CONSUMMATION.,By her whom I was losing?  Was it this?
5553,CONSUMMATION.,"Thus charged with premonition, when I stepped"
5554,CONSUMMATION.,"Into the shaded room, my cheeks were pale,"
5555,CONSUMMATION.,And every nerve was quivering with the stress
5556,CONSUMMATION.,Of uncontrolled emotion.  Ah! my lamb!
5557,CONSUMMATION.,"How white!  How innocent!  My lamb, my lamb!"
5558,CONSUMMATION.,Even the scarlet ribbon which adorned
5559,CONSUMMATION.,"The lambkin of my chase was at her throat,"
5560,CONSUMMATION.,Repeated in a bright geranium-flower!
5561,CONSUMMATION.,
5562,CONSUMMATION.,"""Loop up the curtains, love!  Let in the light!"""
5563,CONSUMMATION.,"The words came strong and sweet, as if the life"
5564,CONSUMMATION.,From which they breathed were at its tidal flood.
5565,CONSUMMATION.,"""Oh! blessed light!"" she added, as the sun"
5566,CONSUMMATION.,"Flamed on the velvet roses of the floor,"
5567,CONSUMMATION.,"And touched to life the pictures on the wall,"
5568,CONSUMMATION.,And smote the dusk with bars of amber.
5569,CONSUMMATION.,
5570,CONSUMMATION.,"""Paul!"""
5571,CONSUMMATION.,
5572,CONSUMMATION.,"I turned to answer, and beheld a face"
5573,CONSUMMATION.,That glowed with a celestial fire like his
5574,CONSUMMATION.,Who talked with God in Sinai.
5575,CONSUMMATION.,
5576,CONSUMMATION.,"""Paul,"" she said."
5577,CONSUMMATION.,"""I have been almost home.  I may not tell,"
5578,CONSUMMATION.,"For language cannot paint, what I have seen."
5579,CONSUMMATION.,"The veil was very thin, and I so near,"
5580,CONSUMMATION.,"I caught the sheen of multitudes, and heard"
5581,CONSUMMATION.,Voices that called and answered from afar
5582,CONSUMMATION.,"Through spaces inconceivable, and songs"
5583,CONSUMMATION.,Whose harmonies responsive surged and sank
5584,CONSUMMATION.,"On the attenuate air, till all my soul"
5585,CONSUMMATION.,"Was thrilled and filled with music, and I prayed"
5586,CONSUMMATION.,"To be let loose, that I might cast myself"
5587,CONSUMMATION.,"Upon the mighty tides, and give my life"
5588,CONSUMMATION.,"To the supernal raptures.  Ay, I prayed"
5589,CONSUMMATION.,"That death might come, and give me my release"
5590,CONSUMMATION.,"From this poor clay, and that I might be born"
5591,CONSUMMATION.,"By its last travail into life."""
5592,CONSUMMATION.,
5593,CONSUMMATION.,"""Dear wife,"" I said,"
5594,CONSUMMATION.,"""You have been wildly dreaming, and your brain,"
5595,CONSUMMATION.,"Quickened to strange vagaries by disease,"
5596,CONSUMMATION.,Has cheated you.  You must not talk like this:
5597,CONSUMMATION.,"'Twill harm you.  I will hold your hand awhile,"
5598,CONSUMMATION.,And you shall have repose.
5599,CONSUMMATION.,
5600,CONSUMMATION.,"She smiled and said,"
5601,CONSUMMATION.,While her eyes shone with an unearthly light:
5602,CONSUMMATION.,"""You are not wise, my dear, in things like these."
5603,CONSUMMATION.,The vision was as real as yourself;
5604,CONSUMMATION.,And it will not be long before I go
5605,CONSUMMATION.,To mingle in the life that I have seen.
5606,CONSUMMATION.,"I know it, dearest, for she told me this."""
5607,CONSUMMATION.,
5608,CONSUMMATION.,"""She told you this?"" I said,--""Who told you this?"
5609,CONSUMMATION.,"Did you hold converse with the multitude?"""
5610,CONSUMMATION.,
5611,CONSUMMATION.,"""Not with the multitude,"" she answered me;"
5612,CONSUMMATION.,"""But while I gazed upon the throng, and prayed"
5613,CONSUMMATION.,"That death might loose me, there appeared a group"
5614,CONSUMMATION.,Of radiant ones behind the filmy veil
5615,CONSUMMATION.,"That hung between us, looking helplessly"
5616,CONSUMMATION.,"Upon my struggle, but with eyes that beamed"
5617,CONSUMMATION.,With love ineffable.  I knew them too--
5618,CONSUMMATION.,Knew all of them but one--and she the first
5619,CONSUMMATION.,And sweetest of them all.  Pure as the light
5620,CONSUMMATION.,"And beautiful as morning, she advanced;"
5621,CONSUMMATION.,"And, at her touch, the veil was parted wide,"
5622,CONSUMMATION.,"While she passed through, and stood beside my bed."
5623,CONSUMMATION.,"She took my hand, she kissed my burning cheek,"
5624,CONSUMMATION.,"And then, in words that calmed my spirit, said:"
5625,CONSUMMATION.,
5626,CONSUMMATION.,"""'Your prayer will soon be answered; but one prayer,"
5627,CONSUMMATION.,"Breathed many years by you, and many years"
5628,CONSUMMATION.,"By one you know not, must be answered first."
5629,CONSUMMATION.,"You must go back, though for a little time,"
5630,CONSUMMATION.,And reap the harvest of a life.  To him
5631,CONSUMMATION.,"Whom you and I have loved, say all your heart"
5632,CONSUMMATION.,"Shall move your lips to speak, and he will hear."
5633,CONSUMMATION.,"The strength, the boldness, the persuasive power"
5634,CONSUMMATION.,"Which you may need for this, shall all be yours;"
5635,CONSUMMATION.,For you shall have the ministry of those
5636,CONSUMMATION.,Whom you have seen.  Speak as a dying wife
5637,CONSUMMATION.,Has liberty to speak to him she leaves;
5638,CONSUMMATION.,And tell him this--that he may know the voice
5639,CONSUMMATION.,That gives you your commission--tell him this:
5640,CONSUMMATION.,The lamb has slipped the leash by which his hand
5641,CONSUMMATION.,"Held her in thrall, and seeks the mountain-height;"
5642,CONSUMMATION.,"And he, if he reclaim her to his grasp,"
5643,CONSUMMATION.,"Must follow where she leads, and kneel at last"
5644,CONSUMMATION.,Upon the summit by her side.  And more:
5645,CONSUMMATION.,"Give him my promise that if he do this,"
5646,CONSUMMATION.,He shall receive from that fair altitude
5647,CONSUMMATION.,"Such vision of the realm that lies around,"
5648,CONSUMMATION.,"Cleft by the river of immortal life,"
5649,CONSUMMATION.,"As shall so lift him from his selfishness,"
5650,CONSUMMATION.,"And so enlarge his soul, that he shall stand"
5651,CONSUMMATION.,"Redeemed from all unworthiness, and saved"
5652,CONSUMMATION.,"To happiness and heaven.'"""
5653,CONSUMMATION.,
5654,CONSUMMATION.,Her words flowed forth
5655,CONSUMMATION.,"With the strong utterance, in truth, of one"
5656,CONSUMMATION.,"Inspired from other worlds; while pale and faint,"
5657,CONSUMMATION.,I drank her revelations.  Unbelief
5658,CONSUMMATION.,"Had given the lie to her abounding faith,"
5659,CONSUMMATION.,"And held her vision figment of disease,"
5660,CONSUMMATION.,Until the message of my mother fell
5661,CONSUMMATION.,"Upon my ears.  Then overcome, I wept"
5662,CONSUMMATION.,"With deep convulsions, rose and walked the room,"
5663,CONSUMMATION.,"Wrung my clasped hands, and cried with choking voice,"
5664,CONSUMMATION.,"""My mother!  O! my mother!"""
5665,CONSUMMATION.,
5666,CONSUMMATION.,"""Gently, love!"
5667,CONSUMMATION.,"For she is with you,"" said my dying wife."
5668,CONSUMMATION.,"""Nay, all of them are with us.  This small room"
5669,CONSUMMATION.,Is now the gate of heaven; and you must do
5670,CONSUMMATION.,That which befits the presence and the place.
5671,CONSUMMATION.,"Come! sit beside me; for my time is short,"
5672,CONSUMMATION.,And I have much to say.  What will you do
5673,CONSUMMATION.,When I am gone?  Will the old life of art
5674,CONSUMMATION.,Content you?  Will you fill your waiting time
5675,CONSUMMATION.,"With the old dreams of fame and excellence?"""
5676,CONSUMMATION.,
5677,CONSUMMATION.,"""Alas!"" I answered, ""I am done with life:"
5678,CONSUMMATION.,My life is dead; and though my hand has won
5679,CONSUMMATION.,"All it has striven to win, and all my heart"
5680,CONSUMMATION.,In its weak pride has prompted it to seek
5681,CONSUMMATION.,Of love and honor; though success is mine
5682,CONSUMMATION.,"In all my eager enterprise, I know"
5683,CONSUMMATION.,My life has been a failure.  I am left
5684,CONSUMMATION.,"Or shall be left, when you, my love, are gone,"
5685,CONSUMMATION.,"Without resource--a hopeless, worthless man,"
5686,CONSUMMATION.,Longing to hide his shame and his despair
5687,CONSUMMATION.,"Within the grave."""
5688,CONSUMMATION.,
5689,CONSUMMATION.,"""I thank thee, Lord!"" she said:"
5690,CONSUMMATION.,"""So many prayers are answered! ... You knew not"
5691,CONSUMMATION.,That I had asked for this.  You did not know
5692,CONSUMMATION.,When you were striving with your feeble might
5693,CONSUMMATION.,"For the great prizes that beguiled your pride,"
5694,CONSUMMATION.,That at the hand of God I begged success.
5695,CONSUMMATION.,"Ay, Paul, I prayed that you might gather all"
5696,CONSUMMATION.,"The good that you have won, and that, at last,"
5697,CONSUMMATION.,You might be brought to know the worthlessncss
5698,CONSUMMATION.,"Of every selfish meed, and feel how weak--"
5699,CONSUMMATION.,How worse than helpless--is the highest man
5700,CONSUMMATION.,"Who lives within, and labors to, himself."
5701,CONSUMMATION.,Not one of all the prizes you have gained
5702,CONSUMMATION.,"Contains the good that lies in your despair."""
5703,CONSUMMATION.,
5704,CONSUMMATION.,"""Teach me,"" I said, ""for I am ignorant;"
5705,CONSUMMATION.,"Lead me, for I am blind.  Explain the past,"
5706,CONSUMMATION.,"With all its errors.  Why am I so low,"
5707,CONSUMMATION.,"And you so high?"""
5708,CONSUMMATION.,
5709,CONSUMMATION.,"She pressed my hand, and said"
5710,CONSUMMATION.,"""You have been hungry all your life for God,"
5711,CONSUMMATION.,And known it not.  You lavished first on me
5712,CONSUMMATION.,Your heart's best love.  You poured its treasured wealth
5713,CONSUMMATION.,At an unworthy shrine.  You made a God
5714,CONSUMMATION.,Of poor mortality; and when you learned
5715,CONSUMMATION.,Your love was greater than the one you loved--
5716,CONSUMMATION.,The one you worshipped--you invoked the aid
5717,CONSUMMATION.,"Of your imagination, to enrich"
5718,CONSUMMATION.,"Your pampered idol, till at last you bowed"
5719,CONSUMMATION.,Before a creature of your thought.  You stole
5720,CONSUMMATION.,From excellence divine the grace and good
5721,CONSUMMATION.,That made me worshipful; and even these
5722,CONSUMMATION.,"Palled on your heart at last, and ceased to yield"
5723,CONSUMMATION.,"The inspiration that you craved.  You pined,"
5724,CONSUMMATION.,You starved for something infinitely sweet;
5725,CONSUMMATION.,"And still you sought it blindly, wilfully"
5726,CONSUMMATION.,"In your poor wife,--sought it, and found it not,"
5727,CONSUMMATION.,Through wasted years of life.
5728,CONSUMMATION.,
5729,CONSUMMATION.,"""And then you craved"
5730,CONSUMMATION.,An infinite return.  You asked for more
5731,CONSUMMATION.,"Than I could give, although I gave you all"
5732,CONSUMMATION.,That woman can bestow on man.  You knew
5733,CONSUMMATION.,"You held my constant love, unlimited"
5734,CONSUMMATION.,Save by the bounds of mortal tenderness;
5735,CONSUMMATION.,And still you longed for more.  Then sprang your scheme
5736,CONSUMMATION.,"For finding in the love of multitudes,"
5737,CONSUMMATION.,"And in their praise, that which had failed in me."
5738,CONSUMMATION.,"You wrote for love and fame, and won them both"
5739,CONSUMMATION.,By manly striving--won and wore them long.
5740,CONSUMMATION.,"All good there is in love and praise of men,"
5741,CONSUMMATION.,You garnered in your life.  On this reward
5742,CONSUMMATION.,"You lived, till you were sated, or until"
5743,CONSUMMATION.,You learned it bore no satisfying meed--
5744,CONSUMMATION.,Learned that the love of many was not more
5745,CONSUMMATION.,"Than love of one.  With all my love your own,"
5746,CONSUMMATION.,"With love and praise of men, your famished soul"
5747,CONSUMMATION.,Craved infinite approval--craved a love
5748,CONSUMMATION.,Beyond the love of woman and of man.
5749,CONSUMMATION.,
5750,CONSUMMATION.,"""Then with new hope, you apotheosized"
5751,CONSUMMATION.,"Your cherished art, and sought for excellence"
5752,CONSUMMATION.,"And for your own approval; with what end,"
5753,CONSUMMATION.,Your helplessness informs me.  You essayed
5754,CONSUMMATION.,The revelation of the mighty forms
5755,CONSUMMATION.,That dwell in the unrealized.  You sought
5756,CONSUMMATION.,"To shape your best ideals, and to find"
5757,CONSUMMATION.,In the grand scheme your motive and reward.
5758,CONSUMMATION.,"All this blind reaching after excellence,"
5759,CONSUMMATION.,Was but the reaching of your soul for God.
5760,CONSUMMATION.,Imagination could not touch the height;
5761,CONSUMMATION.,"And you were baffled.  So, you failed to find"
5762,CONSUMMATION.,"The God your spirit yearned for in your art,"
5763,CONSUMMATION.,And failed of self-approval.
5764,CONSUMMATION.,
5765,CONSUMMATION.,"""You have now"
5766,CONSUMMATION.,"But one resource,--you are shut up to this:"
5767,CONSUMMATION.,You must bow down and worship God; and give
5768,CONSUMMATION.,"Your heart to him, accept his love for you,"
5769,CONSUMMATION.,And feast your soul on excellence in him.
5770,CONSUMMATION.,"So, a new life shall open to your feet,"
5771,CONSUMMATION.,Strown richly with rewards; and when your steps
5772,CONSUMMATION.,"Shall reach the river, I will wait for you"
5773,CONSUMMATION.,"Upon the other shore, and we shall be"
5774,CONSUMMATION.,One in the life immortal as in this.
5775,CONSUMMATION.,O!  Paul! your time is now.  I cannot die
5776,CONSUMMATION.,And leave you comfortless.  I cannot die
5777,CONSUMMATION.,And enter on the pleasures that I know
5778,CONSUMMATION.,"Await me yonder, with the consciousness"
5779,CONSUMMATION.,"That you are still unhappy."""
5780,CONSUMMATION.,
5781,CONSUMMATION.,All my life
5782,CONSUMMATION.,Thus lay revealed in light which she had poured
5783,CONSUMMATION.,Upon its track.  I learned where she had found
5784,CONSUMMATION.,"Her peaceful joy, her satisfying good,"
5785,CONSUMMATION.,"And where, in my rebellious pride of heart,"
5786,CONSUMMATION.,"Mine had been lost.  She, by an instinct sure,"
5787,CONSUMMATION.,"Or by the grace of Heaven, had in her youth,"
5788,CONSUMMATION.,"Though sorely chastened, given herself to God"
5789,CONSUMMATION.,And through a life of saintly purity--
5790,CONSUMMATION.,A life of love to me and love to all--
5791,CONSUMMATION.,Had feasted at the fountain of all love.
5792,CONSUMMATION.,"Had worshipped at the Excellence Divine,"
5793,CONSUMMATION.,And only waited for my last adieu
5794,CONSUMMATION.,To take her crown.
5795,CONSUMMATION.,
5796,CONSUMMATION.,I sat like one struck dumb.
5797,CONSUMMATION.,"I knew not how to speak, or what to do."
5798,CONSUMMATION.,She looked at me expectant; while a thrill
5799,CONSUMMATION.,Of terror shot through all my frame.
5800,CONSUMMATION.,
5801,CONSUMMATION.,"""Alas!"""
5802,CONSUMMATION.,"She said, ""I thought you would be ready now."""
5803,CONSUMMATION.,
5804,CONSUMMATION.,"At this, the door was opened silently,"
5805,CONSUMMATION.,And our dear daughter stood within the room.
5806,CONSUMMATION.,Alarmed at vision of the sudden change
5807,CONSUMMATION.,"That death had wrought upon her mother's face,"
5808,CONSUMMATION.,"She hastened to her side, and kneeling there,"
5809,CONSUMMATION.,"Bowed on her breast with tears and choking sobs,"
5810,CONSUMMATION.,Her heart too full for speech.
5811,CONSUMMATION.,
5812,CONSUMMATION.,"""Be silent, dear!"""
5813,CONSUMMATION.,"The dying mother said, resting her hand"
5814,CONSUMMATION.,"Upon her daughter's head.  ""Be silent, dear!"
5815,CONSUMMATION.,"Your father kneels to pray.  Make room for him,"
5816,CONSUMMATION.,"That he may kneel beside you."""
5817,CONSUMMATION.,
5818,CONSUMMATION.,"At her words,"
5819,CONSUMMATION.,I was endowed with apprehensions new;
5820,CONSUMMATION.,"And somewhere in my quickened consciousness,"
5821,CONSUMMATION.,"I felt the presence of her heavenly friends,"
5822,CONSUMMATION.,And knew that there were spirits in the room.
5823,CONSUMMATION.,"I did not doubt, nor have I doubted since,"
5824,CONSUMMATION.,That there were loving witnesses of all
5825,CONSUMMATION.,The scenes enacted round that hallowed bed.
5826,CONSUMMATION.,"Ay, and they spoke.  Deep in the innermost"
5827,CONSUMMATION.,"I heard the tender words, ""O! kneel my son!--"""
5828,CONSUMMATION.,A sweet monition from my mother's lips.
5829,CONSUMMATION.,
5830,CONSUMMATION.,"""Kneel! kneel!""  It was the echo of a throng."
5831,CONSUMMATION.,
5832,CONSUMMATION.,"""Kneel! kneel!""  The gentle mandate reached my heart"
5833,CONSUMMATION.,From depths of lofty space.  It was the voice
5834,CONSUMMATION.,Of the Good Father.
5835,CONSUMMATION.,
5836,CONSUMMATION.,"From the curtain folds,"
5837,CONSUMMATION.,"That rustled at the window, in the airs"
5838,CONSUMMATION.,"That moved with conscious pulse to passing wings,"
5839,CONSUMMATION.,"Came the same burden ""Kneel!"""
5840,CONSUMMATION.,
5841,CONSUMMATION.,"""Kneel! kneel!  O! kneel!"""
5842,CONSUMMATION.,"In tones of earnest pleading, came from lips"
5843,CONSUMMATION.,Already pinched by death.
5844,CONSUMMATION.,
5845,CONSUMMATION.,A hundred worlds.
5846,CONSUMMATION.,"Imposed upon my shoulders, had not bowed"
5847,CONSUMMATION.,And crushed me to my knees with surer power.
5848,CONSUMMATION.,The hand that lay upon my daughter's head
5849,CONSUMMATION.,Then passed to mine; but still my lips were dumb.
5850,CONSUMMATION.,
5851,CONSUMMATION.,"""Pray!"" said the spirit of my mother."
5852,CONSUMMATION.,
5853,CONSUMMATION.,"""Pray!"""
5854,CONSUMMATION.,"The word repeated, came from many lips."
5855,CONSUMMATION.,
5856,CONSUMMATION.,"""Pray!"" said the voice of God within my soul;"
5857,CONSUMMATION.,While every whisper of the living air
5858,CONSUMMATION.,Echoed the low command.
5859,CONSUMMATION.,
5860,CONSUMMATION.,"""Pray! pray!  O! pray!"""
5861,CONSUMMATION.,"My dying wife entreated, while swift tears"
5862,CONSUMMATION.,Slid to her pillow.
5863,CONSUMMATION.,
5864,CONSUMMATION.,"Then the impulse came,"
5865,CONSUMMATION.,And I poured out like water all my heart.
5866,CONSUMMATION.,"""O!  God!"" I said, ""be merciful to me"
5867,CONSUMMATION.,A reprobate!  I have blasphemed thy name.
5868,CONSUMMATION.,"Abused thy patient love, and held from thee"
5869,CONSUMMATION.,"My heart and life; and now, in my extreme"
5870,CONSUMMATION.,"Of need and of despair, I come to thee."
5871,CONSUMMATION.,"O! cast me not away, for here, at last,"
5872,CONSUMMATION.,"After a life of selfishness and sin,"
5873,CONSUMMATION.,"I yield my will to thine, and pledge my soul--"
5874,CONSUMMATION.,"All that I am, all I can ever be--"
5875,CONSUMMATION.,Supremely to thy service.  I renounce
5876,CONSUMMATION.,"All worldly aims, all selfish enterprise."
5877,CONSUMMATION.,And dedicate the remnant of my power
5878,CONSUMMATION.,To thee and those thou lovest.  Comfort me!
5879,CONSUMMATION.,"O! come and comfort me, for I despair!"
5880,CONSUMMATION.,"Give me thy peace, for I am rent and tossed!"
5881,CONSUMMATION.,"Feed me with love, else I shall die of want!"
5882,CONSUMMATION.,"Behold!  I empty out my worthlessncss,"
5883,CONSUMMATION.,"And beg thee to come in, and fill my soul"
5884,CONSUMMATION.,With thy rich presence.  I adore thy love;
5885,CONSUMMATION.,"I seek for thy approval; I bow down,"
5886,CONSUMMATION.,"And worship thee, the Excellence Supreme."
5887,CONSUMMATION.,I've tasted of the sweetest that the world
5888,CONSUMMATION.,Can give to me; and human love and praise.
5889,CONSUMMATION.,And all of excellence within the scope
5890,CONSUMMATION.,"Of my conception, and my power to reach"
5891,CONSUMMATION.,"And realize in highest forms of art,"
5892,CONSUMMATION.,"Have left me hungry, thirsty lor thyself."
5893,CONSUMMATION.,O! feed and fire me!  Fill and furnish me!
5894,CONSUMMATION.,And if thou hast for me some humble task--
5895,CONSUMMATION.,"Some service for thyself, or for thy own--"
5896,CONSUMMATION.,"Reveal it to thy sad, repentant child,"
5897,CONSUMMATION.,Or use him as thy willing instrument.
5898,CONSUMMATION.,"I ask it for the sake of Jesus Christ,"
5899,CONSUMMATION.,"Henceforth my Master!"""
5900,CONSUMMATION.,
5901,CONSUMMATION.,"Multitudes, it seemed,"
5902,CONSUMMATION.,"Responded with ""Amen!"" as if the word"
5903,CONSUMMATION.,Were caught from mortal lips by swooping choirs
5904,CONSUMMATION.,"Of spirits ministrant, and borne away"
5905,CONSUMMATION.,In sweet reverberations into space.
5906,CONSUMMATION.,
5907,CONSUMMATION.,"I raised my head at last, and met the eyes"
5908,CONSUMMATION.,"Bright with the light of death, and with the dawn"
5909,CONSUMMATION.,Of opening heaven.  The smile that overspread
5910,CONSUMMATION.,The fading features was the peaceful smile
5911,CONSUMMATION.,"Of an immortal,--full of faith and love--"
5912,CONSUMMATION.,"A satisfied, triumphant, shining smile,"
5913,CONSUMMATION.,Lit by the heavenly glory.
5914,CONSUMMATION.,
5915,CONSUMMATION.,"""Paul,"" she said,"
5916,CONSUMMATION.,"""My work is done; but you will live and work"
5917,CONSUMMATION.,"These many years.  Your life is just begun,"
5918,CONSUMMATION.,"Too late, but well begun; and you are mine,"
5919,CONSUMMATION.,Now and forevermore....  Dear Lord! my thanks
5920,CONSUMMATION.,"For this thy crowning blessing!"""
5921,CONSUMMATION.,
5922,CONSUMMATION.,"Then she paused,"
5923,CONSUMMATION.,"And raised her eyes in a seraphic trance,"
5924,CONSUMMATION.,"And lifted her thin fingers, that were thrilled"
5925,CONSUMMATION.,"With tremulous motion, like the slender spray"
5926,CONSUMMATION.,"On which a throbbing song-bird clings, and pours"
5927,CONSUMMATION.,"His sweet incontinence of ecstasy,"
5928,CONSUMMATION.,And then in broken whispers said to me:
5929,CONSUMMATION.,"""Do you not hear them?  They have caught the news,"
5930,CONSUMMATION.,And all the sky is ringing with their song
5931,CONSUMMATION.,Of gladness and of welcome.  '_Paul is saved_!
5932,CONSUMMATION.,_Paul is redeemed and saved!_' I hear them cry;
5933,CONSUMMATION.,"And myriad voices catch the new delight,"
5934,CONSUMMATION.,"And carry the acclaim, till heaven itself"
5935,CONSUMMATION.,"Sends back the happy echo: '_Paul is saved._'"""
5936,CONSUMMATION.,
5937,CONSUMMATION.,"She stretched her hands, and took me to her breast."
5938,CONSUMMATION.,"I kissed her, blessed her, spoke my last adieu,"
5939,CONSUMMATION.,And yielded place to her whom God had given
5940,CONSUMMATION.,To be our child.  After a long embrace.
5941,CONSUMMATION.,"She whispered: ""I am weary; let me sleep!"""
5942,CONSUMMATION.,
5943,CONSUMMATION.,"She passed to peaceful slumber like a child,"
5944,CONSUMMATION.,The while attendant angels built the dream
5945,CONSUMMATION.,On which she rode to heaven.  Not once again
5946,CONSUMMATION.,"She spoke to mortal ears, but slept and smiled,"
5947,CONSUMMATION.,"And slept and smiled again, till daylight passed."
5948,CONSUMMATION.,The night came down; the long hours lapsed away;
5949,CONSUMMATION.,"The city sounds grew fainter, till at last"
5950,CONSUMMATION.,We sat alone with silence and with death.
5951,CONSUMMATION.,"At the first blush of morning she looked up,"
5952,CONSUMMATION.,"And spoke, but not to us: ""I'm coming now!"""
5953,CONSUMMATION.,
5954,CONSUMMATION.,"I sought the window, to relieve the pain"
5955,CONSUMMATION.,"Of long suppressed emotion.  In the East,"
5956,CONSUMMATION.,"Tinged with the golden dawn, the morning star"
5957,CONSUMMATION.,"Was blazing in its glory, while beneath,"
5958,CONSUMMATION.,"The slender moon, at its last rising, hung,"
5959,CONSUMMATION.,"Paling and dying in the growing light,"
5960,CONSUMMATION.,And passing with that leading up to heaven.
5961,CONSUMMATION.,"My daughter stood beside her mother's bed,"
5962,CONSUMMATION.,But I had better vision of the scene
5963,CONSUMMATION.,In the sweet symbol God had hung for me
5964,CONSUMMATION.,Upon the sky.
5965,CONSUMMATION.,
5966,CONSUMMATION.,"Swiftly the dawn advanced,"
5967,CONSUMMATION.,"And higher rose, and still more faintly shone,"
5968,CONSUMMATION.,"The star-led moon.  Then, as it faded out,"
5969,CONSUMMATION.,"Quenched by prevailing day, I heard one sigh"
5970,CONSUMMATION.,"A sigh so charged with pathos of deep joy,"
5971,CONSUMMATION.,"And peace ineffable, that memory"
5972,CONSUMMATION.,Can never lose the sound; and all was past!
5973,CONSUMMATION.,The peaceful summer-day that rose upon
5974,CONSUMMATION.,"This night of trial and this morn of grief,"
5975,CONSUMMATION.,Rose not with calmer light than that which dawned
5976,CONSUMMATION.,"Upon my spirit.  Chastened, bowed, subdued,"
5977,CONSUMMATION.,"I kissed the rod that smote me, and exclaimed:"
5978,CONSUMMATION.,"""The Lord hath given; the Lord hath taken away"
5979,CONSUMMATION.,"And blessed be his name!"""
5980,CONSUMMATION.,
5981,CONSUMMATION.,Rebellion slept.
5982,CONSUMMATION.,"I grieved, and still I grieve; but with a heart"
5983,CONSUMMATION.,"At peace with God, and soft with sympathy"
5984,CONSUMMATION.,"Toward all my sorrowing, struggling, sinful race."
5985,CONSUMMATION.,"My hope, that clung so fondly to the world"
5986,CONSUMMATION.,"And the rewards of time, an anchor sure"
5987,CONSUMMATION.,Now grasps the Eternal Rock within the veil
5988,CONSUMMATION.,"Of troubled waters.  Storms may wrench and toss,"
5989,CONSUMMATION.,"And tides may swing me, in their ebb and flow,"
5990,CONSUMMATION.,But I shall not be moved.
5991,CONSUMMATION.,
5992,CONSUMMATION.,Once more! once more
5993,CONSUMMATION.,"I shall behold her face, and clasp her hand!"
5994,CONSUMMATION.,Once more--forevermore!
5995,CONSUMMATION.,
5996,CONSUMMATION.,So here I give
5997,CONSUMMATION.,"The gospel of her precious, Christian life."
5998,CONSUMMATION.,"I owe it to herself, and to the world."
5999,CONSUMMATION.,Grateful for all her tender ministry
6000,CONSUMMATION.,"In life and death, I bring these leaves, entwined"
6001,CONSUMMATION.,"With her own roses, dewy with my tears,"
6002,CONSUMMATION.,And lay them as the tribute of my love
6003,CONSUMMATION.,Upon the grave that holds her sacred dust.
