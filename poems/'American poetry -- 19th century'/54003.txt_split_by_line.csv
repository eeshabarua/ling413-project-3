67,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
68,PREFACE.,
69,PREFACE.,
70,PREFACE.,"The ""Farm Ballads"" have met with so kind and general a reception as to"
71,PREFACE.,encourage the publishing of a companion volume.
72,PREFACE.,
73,PREFACE.,"In this book, also, the author has aimed to give expression to the"
74,PREFACE.,"truth, that with every person, even if humble or debased, there may"
75,PREFACE.,"be some good, worth lifting up and saving; that in each human being,"
76,PREFACE.,"though revered and seemingly immaculate, are some faults which deserve"
77,PREFACE.,"pointing out and correcting; and that all circumstances of life,"
78,PREFACE.,"however trivial they appear, may possess those alternations of the"
79,PREFACE.,"comic and pathetic, the good and bad, the joyful and sorrowful, upon"
80,PREFACE.,"which walk the days and nights, the summers and winters, the lives and"
81,PREFACE.,"deaths, of this strange world."
82,PREFACE.,
83,PREFACE.,He would take this occasion to give a word of thanks to those who have
84,PREFACE.,staid with him through evil and good report; who have overlooked his
85,PREFACE.,literary faults for the sake of the truths he was struggling to tell;
86,PREFACE.,and who have believed--what he knows--that he is honest.
87,PREFACE.,
88,PREFACE.,"With these few words of introduction, the author launches this second"
89,PREFACE.,"bark upon the sea of popular opinion; grinds his axe, and enters once"
90,PREFACE.,"more the great forest of Human Nature, for timber to go on with his"
91,PREFACE.,boat-building.

284,I.,
285,I.,"As whisper the half-leafless branches, when Autumn's brisk breezes"
286,I.,"have come,"
287,I.,His little scrub-thicket of pupils sent upward a half-smothered hum;

291,I.,"Resounded the feet of his pupils, whenever their heels struck the"

298,I.,
299,I.,"There were both of the Smith boys, as studious as if they bore names"

301,I.,"And Jim Jones, a heaven-built mechanic, the slyest young knave in the"
302,I.,room:
303,I.,
304,I.,"With a countenance grave as a horse's, and his honest eyes fixed on a"
305,I.,"pin,"
306,I.,Queer-bent on a deeply laid project to tunnel Joe Hawkins's skin.
307,I.,
308,I.,"There were anxious young novices, drilling their spelling-books into"
309,I.,"the brain,"
310,I.,"Loud-puffing each half-whispered letter, like an engine just starting"
311,I.,a train.
312,I.,
313,I.,"There was one fiercely muscular fellow, who scowled at the sums on his"
314,I.,"slate,"
315,I.,"And leered at the innocent figures a look of unspeakable hate,"
316,I.,
317,I.,"And set his white teeth close together, and gave his thin lips a short"
318,I.,"twist,"
319,I.,"As to say, ""I could whip you, confound you! if sums could be done with"
320,I.,"my fist!"""
321,I.,

339,II.,"With many a break on their surface, where grinned a wood-grating of"
340,II.,lath;
341,II.,
342,II.,"A patch of thick plaster, just over the school-master's rickety chair,"
343,II.,"Seemed threat'ningly o'er him suspended, like Damocles' sword, by a"
344,II.,hair;
345,II.,
346,II.,There were tracks on the desks where the knife-blades had wandered in

774,III.,A word went over the broad hill-sweeps
775,III.,Of the listening land where the Tiffin creeps:
776,III.,
777,III.,"""_She married, holding on high her head;_"
778,III.,_But the groom was false as the vows he said;_
779,III.,_With lies and crimes his days are checked;_
780,III.,"_The girl is alone, and her life is wrecked._"""
781,III.,
782,III.,The midnight rested its heavy arm
783,III.,Upon the grief-encumbered farm;
784,III.,"And hoarse-voiced Sorrow wandered at will,"
785,III.,Like a moan when the summer's night is still;
786,III.,"And the spotted cows, with bellies of white,"
787,III.,"And well-filled teats all crowded awry,"
788,III.,"Stood in the black stalls of the night,"
789,III.,"Nor herded nor milked, and wondered why."
790,III.,"And the house was gloomy, still, and cold;"
791,III.,"And the hard-palmed farmer, newly old,"
792,III.,"Sat in an unfrequented place,"
793,III.,Hiding e'en from the dark his face;
794,III.,And a solemn silence rested long
795,III.,"On all, save the cricket's dismal song."
796,III.,
797,III.,"[Illustration: ""HIDING E'EN FROM THE DARK HIS FACE.""]"
798,III.,
799,III.,"But the mother drew the girl to her breast,"
800,III.,And gave to her spirit words of rest:
801,III.,"Come to my lap, my wee-grown baby; rest you upon my knee;"
802,III.,"You have been traveling toward the light, and drawing away from me;"
803,III.,"You turned your face from my dark path to catch the light o' the sun,"
804,III.,"And 'tis no more nor less, my child, than children ever have done."
805,III.,"So you joined hands with one you loved, when we to the cross-road came,"
806,III.,"And went your way, as Heaven did say, and who but Heaven to blame?"
807,III.,
808,III.,"You must not weep that he you chose was all the time untrue,"
809,III.,Or stab with hate the man whose heart you thought was made for you.
810,III.,The love God holds for your bright soul is more to get and give
811,III.,Than all the love of all of the men while He may bid them live.
812,III.,So let your innocence stanch the wound made by another's guilt;
813,III.,For Vengeance' blade was ever made with neither guard nor hilt!
814,III.,
815,III.,"Who will avenge you, darling? The sun that shines on high."
816,III.,He will paint the picture of your wrongs before the great world's eye.
817,III.,"He will look upon your sweet soul, in its pure mantle of white,"
818,III.,"Till it shine upon your enemies, and dazzle all their sight."
819,III.,He'll come each day to point his finger at him who played the knave;
820,III.,"And 'tis denied from him to hide, excepting in the grave."
821,III.,
822,III.,"Who will avenge you, darling? Your sister, the sky above."
823,III.,Each cloud she floats above you shall be a token of love;
824,III.,"She will bend o'er you at night-fall her pure broad breast of blue,"
825,III.,And every gem that glitters there shall flash a smile to you.
826,III.,And all her great wide distances to your good name belong;
827,III.,'Tis not so far from star to star as 'twixt the right and wrong!
828,III.,
829,III.,"Who will avenge you, darling? All the breezes that blow."
830,III.,They will whisper to each other your tale of guiltless woe;
831,III.,"The perfumes that do load them your innocence shall bless,"
832,III.,"And they will soothe your aching brow with pitying, kind caress."
833,III.,They will sweep away the black veil that hangs about your fame:

1067,II.,"To me, whose weak and hungry heart deep desolation dreaded!"

1069,II.,"And once again I threatened him, and warned him I was wedded."
1070,II.,"He bade me follow him, and see my erring fancy righted:"

1130,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1131,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1132,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Here's a precept, young man, you should follow with care:"
1133,THE THREE LOVERS.,"If you're courting a girl, court her honest and square."
1134,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1135,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Mr. 'Liakim Smith was a hard-fisted farmer,"
1136,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Of moderate wealth,"
1137,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And immoderate health,"
1138,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Who fifty-odd years, in a stub-and-twist armor"
1139,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Of callus and tan,"
1140,THE THREE LOVERS.,Had fought like a man
1141,THE THREE LOVERS.,"His own dogged progress, through trials and cares,"
1142,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And log-heaps and brush-heaps and wild-cats and bears,"
1143,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And agues and fevers and thistles and briers,"
1144,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Poor kinsmen, rich foemen, false saints, and true liars;"
1145,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Who oft, like the ""man in our town,"" overwise,"
1146,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Through the brambles of error had scratched out his eyes,"
1147,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And when the unwelcome result he had seen,"
1148,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Had altered his notion,"
1149,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Reversing the motion,"
1150,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And scratched them both in again, perfect and clean;"
1151,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Who had weathered some storms, as a sailor might say,"
1152,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And tacked to the left and the right of his way,"
1153,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Till he found himself anchored, past tempests and breakers,"
1154,THE THREE LOVERS.,Upon a good farm of a hundred-odd acres.
1155,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1156,THE THREE LOVERS.,"As for 'Liakim's wife, in four words may be told"
1157,THE THREE LOVERS.,Her whole standing in life:
1158,THE THREE LOVERS.,She was 'Liakim's wife.
1159,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Whereas she'd been young, she was now growing old,"
1160,THE THREE LOVERS.,"But did, she considered, as well as one could,"
1161,THE THREE LOVERS.,"When HE looked on her hard work, and saw that 'twas good."
1162,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1163,THE THREE LOVERS.,The family record showed only a daughter;
1164,THE THREE LOVERS.,"But she had a face,"
1165,THE THREE LOVERS.,As if each fabled Grace
1166,THE THREE LOVERS.,"In a burst of delight to her bosom had caught her,"
1167,THE THREE LOVERS.,Or as if all the flowers in each Smith generation
1168,THE THREE LOVERS.,Had blossomed at last in one grand culmination.
1169,THE THREE LOVERS.,Style lingered unconscious in all of her dresses;
1170,THE THREE LOVERS.,"She'd starlight for glances, and sunbeams for tresses."
1171,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Wherever she went, with her right royal tread,"
1172,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Each youth, when he'd passed her a bit, turned his head;"
1173,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And so one might say, though the figure be strained,"
1174,THE THREE LOVERS.,She had turned half the heads that the township contained.
1175,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1176,THE THREE LOVERS.,Now Bess had a lover--a monstrous young hulk;
1177,THE THREE LOVERS.,A farmer by trade--
1178,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Strong, sturdy, and staid;"
1179,THE THREE LOVERS.,A man of good parts--if you counted by bulk;
1180,THE THREE LOVERS.,"A man of great weight--by the scales; and, indeed,"
1181,THE THREE LOVERS.,A man of some depth--as was shown by his feed.
1182,THE THREE LOVERS.,His face was a fat exclamation of wonder;
1183,THE THREE LOVERS.,His voice was not quite unsuggestive of thunder;
1184,THE THREE LOVERS.,His laugh was a cross 'twixt a yell and a chuckle;
1185,THE THREE LOVERS.,"He'd a number one foot,"
1186,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And a number ten boot,"
1187,THE THREE LOVERS.,And a knock-down reserved in each separate knuckle.
1188,THE THREE LOVERS.,"He'd a heart mad in love with the girl of his choice,"
1189,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Who made him alternately mope and rejoice,"
1190,THE THREE LOVERS.,"By dealing him one day discouraging messes,"
1191,THE THREE LOVERS.,And soothing him next day with smiles and caresses.
1192,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1193,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Now Bess had a lover, who hoped her to wed--"
1194,THE THREE LOVERS.,A rising young lawyer--more rising than read;
1195,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Whose theories all were quite startling; and who,"
1196,THE THREE LOVERS.,Like many a chap
1197,THE THREE LOVERS.,"In these days of strange hap,"
1198,THE THREE LOVERS.,Was living on what he expected to do;
1199,THE THREE LOVERS.,While his landlady thought 'twould have been rather neat
1200,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Could he only have learned,"
1201,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Till some practice was earned,"
1202,THE THREE LOVERS.,To subsist upon what he expected to eat.
1203,THE THREE LOVERS.,"He was bodily small, howe'er mentally great,"
1204,THE THREE LOVERS.,And suggestively less than a hundred in weight.
1205,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1206,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Now Bess had a lover--young Patrick; a sinner,"
1207,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And lad of all work,"
1208,THE THREE LOVERS.,"From the suburbs of Cork,"
1209,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Who worked for her father, and thought _he_ could win her."
1210,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And if Jacob could faithful serve fourteen years through,"
1211,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And still thrive and rejoice,"
1212,THE THREE LOVERS.,"For the girl of his choice,"
1213,THE THREE LOVERS.,He thought he could play at that game one or two.
1214,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1215,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Now 'Liakim Smith had a theory hid,"
1216,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And by egotism fed,"
1217,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Somewhere up in his head,"
1218,THE THREE LOVERS.,That a dutiful daughter should always as bid
1219,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Grow old in the service of him who begot her,"
1220,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Imbibe his beliefs,"
1221,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Have a care for his griefs,"
1222,THE THREE LOVERS.,And faithfully bring him his cider and water.
1223,THE THREE LOVERS.,"So, as might be expected, he turned up his nose,"
1224,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Also a cold shoulder, to Bessie's two beaux;"
1225,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And finally turned them away from his door,"
1226,THE THREE LOVERS.,Forbidding them ever to enter it more;
1227,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And detailed young Patrick as kind of a guard,"
1228,THE THREE LOVERS.,With orders to keep them both out of the yard.
1229,THE THREE LOVERS.,"So Pat took his task, with a treacherous smile,"
1230,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And bullied the small one,"
1231,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And dodged the big tall one,"
1232,THE THREE LOVERS.,And slyly made love to Miss Bess all the while.
1233,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1234,THE THREE LOVERS.,"But one evening, when 'Liakim and wife crowned their labors"
1235,THE THREE LOVERS.,With praise and entreating
1236,THE THREE LOVERS.,"At the village prayer-meeting,"
1237,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And Patrick had stepped for a while to some neighbor's,"
1238,THE THREE LOVERS.,"The lawyer had come, in the trimmest of dress,"
1239,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And, dapper and slim,"
1240,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And small, e'en for him,"
1241,THE THREE LOVERS.,Was holding a session of court with Miss Bess.
1242,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And Bess, sly love-athlete, was suited first rate"
1243,THE THREE LOVERS.,At a flirtation-mill with this legal light-weight;
1244,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And was listening to him, as minutes spun on,"
1245,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Of pleas he could make,"
1246,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And of fees he would take,"
1247,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And of suits that he should, in the future, have won;"
1248,THE THREE LOVERS.,"When just as the cold, heartless clock counted eight,"
1249,THE THREE LOVERS.,Miss Bessie's quick ear caught a step at the gate.
1250,THE THREE LOVERS.,"""'Tis mother!"" she cried: ""oh, go quick, I implore!"
1251,THE THREE LOVERS.,But father'll drive 'round and come in the back-door!
1252,THE THREE LOVERS.,"You can not escape them, however you turn!"
1253,THE THREE LOVERS.,"So hide for a while--let me see--in this churn!"""
1254,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1255,THE THREE LOVERS.,The churn was quite large enough for him to turn in--
1256,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Expanded out so,"
1257,THE THREE LOVERS.,"By machinery to go,"
1258,THE THREE LOVERS.,'Twould have done for a dairy-man-Cyclops to churn in.
1259,THE THREE LOVERS.,"'Twas fixed for attaching a pitman or lever,"
1260,THE THREE LOVERS.,"To go by a horse-power--a notion quite clever,"
1261,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Invented and built by the Irishman, Pat,"
1262,THE THREE LOVERS.,Who pleased Mrs. 'Liakim hugely by that.
1263,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1264,THE THREE LOVERS.,"The lawyer went into the case with much ease,"
1265,THE THREE LOVERS.,And hugged the belief
1266,THE THREE LOVERS.,"That the cause would be brief,"
1267,THE THREE LOVERS.,And settled himself down with hardly a squeeze.
1268,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And Bess said, ""Keep still, for there's plenty of room,"""
1269,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And shut down the cover, and left him in gloom."
1270,THE THREE LOVERS.,
1271,THE THREE LOVERS.,"But scarcely were matters left decently so,"
1272,THE THREE LOVERS.,"In walked--not her mother,"
1273,THE THREE LOVERS.,But--worry and bother!--
1274,THE THREE LOVERS.,"The mammoth young farmer, whose first name was Joe."
1275,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And he gleefully sung, in a heavy bass tone,"
1276,THE THREE LOVERS.,Which came in one note
1277,THE THREE LOVERS.,"From the depths of his throat,"
1278,THE THREE LOVERS.,"""I'm glad I have come, since I've found you alone."
1279,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Let's sit here a while, by this kerosene light,"
1280,THE THREE LOVERS.,"An' spark it a while now with all of our might."""
1281,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And Bessie was willing; and so they sat down,"
1282,THE THREE LOVERS.,The maiden so fair and the farmer so brown.
1283,THE THREE LOVERS.,"They talked of things great, and they talked of things small,"
1284,THE THREE LOVERS.,"Which none could condemn,"
1285,THE THREE LOVERS.,"And which may have pleased them,"
1286,THE THREE LOVERS.,But which did not interest the lawyer at all;
1287,THE THREE LOVERS.,And Bessie seemed giving but little concern
1288,THE THREE LOVERS.,To the feelings of him she had shut in the churn.

2155,I.,The Grecians loved their soldier dead:
2156,I.,"They prized the casket, though the pearl had fled."
2157,I.,"When he who could be dangerous in the fight,"
2158,I.,"Had proved his soul's magnificence and might,"
2159,I.,But--his poor body vanquished--with a sigh
2160,I.,"Had laid him down upon the sands to die,"
2161,I.,He vaulted 'mongst the nation's honored sons;
2162,I.,He was the love of all the living ones.
2163,I.,"They rallied round a chief when fallen low,"
2164,I.,To guard his numb flesh from a hostile blow.
2165,I.,"""Rescue the dead!"" was then the clarion cry;"
2166,I.,"""Rescue the dead, for we ourselves must die!"""
2167,I.,"So, oft they made, before the strife was done,"
2168,I.,"A dozen corpses more, to rescue one."
2169,I.,"When that great agony of muscle, brain,"
2170,I.,"Heart, soul, tumultuous joy, and frantic pain,"
2171,I.,"Men call a battle, had been lost and won,"
2172,I.,"And it was told what side the gods were on,"
2173,I.,And o'er the brows of which exhausted band
2174,I.,"Proud Victory should press her jewelled hand,"
2175,I.,Then from the conquered to the conquering came
2176,I.,"A voice that made its way like tongues of flame,"
2177,I.,And swift and chivalrous compliance bred:
2178,I.,"""Give us a truce, that we may bury our dead!"""
2179,I.,"Six Grecian generals came from war one day,"

2185,I.,
2186,I.,"Then popular rage rose in a fiery flood,"
2187,I.,"And curled about them, and licked up their blood."
2188,I.,Why did each one fall with dissevered head?
2189,I.,Because the Grecians loved their soldier dead!
2190,I.,"A man came running from Thermopylæ,"
2191,I.,"And said, ""'Tis done; they all were slain but me."""
2192,I.,"Why did his fellow-Spartans sneer and hiss,"

2194,I.,"And say, ""Take back your blood, you craven drone,"
2195,I.,"And leave it where your comrades lost their own?"""
2196,I.,It was because the unhappy man had sped
2197,I.,"Away from death, and left his comrades dead."

2199,I.,"Sent her son warward, with this mandate high:"

2222,II.,The magic silver of some gifted tongue
2223,II.,Chaplets of praise above his body flung;
2224,II.,"And words fell on the living, listening ear,"
2225,II.,The dead might well awaken but to hear.
2226,II.,
2227,II.,"The flags that he had captured, draped in gloom,"
2228,II.,Before him waved--he found them at his tomb;
2229,II.,"Sweet flowers, the freshest beauties of a day,"
2230,II.,Made a fair garden round the hero's clay;
2231,II.,Great monuments wrote solemnly on high
2232,II.,His glory o'er the blue page of the sky;
2233,II.,"And epitaphs, beneath the sparkling name,"
2234,II.,Gave to the voiceless dead a tongue of flame.
2235,II.,"Who fell with patriotic bravery, knew,"
2236,II.,"Humble or proud, his deeds would have their due;"
2237,II.,"Whoe'er with baseness threw his name away,"
2238,II.,"Knew that, when fall'n, he formed the vulture's prey."
2239,II.,"Oh yes, the Romans loved their valiant dead,"
2240,II.,The while their living were to victory led!
2241,II.,Swift-sighted Rome! you knew the intense desire
2242,II.,Of men to live when lesser men expire;
2243,II.,"Knew how they struggle, e'en with latest breath,"
2244,II.,To make their names o'erbridge the gulf of death;
2245,II.,Knew the last rites to one dead hero paid
2246,II.,Would sharpen many a living warrior's blade;
2247,II.,Knew how your victory-accustomed bands
2248,II.,Were waved along by their dead comrades' hands!

2260,III.,"No maid or matron eloquently fair,"
2261,III.,"Naught that can feeling to expression wed,"
2262,III.,May say how well we love our soldier dead.
2263,III.,"If in those days when self was all above,"
2264,III.,"Men loved so well ere they were taught to love,"
2265,III.,What deep affection may be felt and seen
2266,III.,From hearts taught by the love-crowned Nazarene!

2747,BROTHERS AND FRIENDS.,
2748,BROTHERS AND FRIENDS.,"When, with a strengthened soul and chastened brain,"
