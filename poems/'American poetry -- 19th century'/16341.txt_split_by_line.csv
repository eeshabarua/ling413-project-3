224,I.,
225,I.,"When to the common rest that crowns our days,"
226,I.,"Called in the noon of life, the good man goes,"
227,I.,"Or full of years, and ripe in wisdom, lays"
228,I.,His silver temples in their last repose;
229,I.,"When, o'er the buds of youth, the death-wind blows,"
230,I.,And blights the fairest; when our bitter tears
231,I.,"Stream, as the eyes of those that love us close,"
232,I.,"We think on what they were, with many fears"
233,I.,"Lest goodness die with them, and leave the coming years:"
234,I.,
235,I.,
236,II.,II.
237,II.,
238,II.,"And therefore, to our hearts, the days gone by,--"
239,II.,"When lived the honoured sage whose death we wept,"
240,II.,"And the soft virtues beamed from many an eye,"
241,II.,"And beat in many a heart that long has slept,--"
242,II.,Like spots of earth where angel-feet have stepped--
243,II.,Are holy; and high-dreaming bards have told
244,II.,"Of times when worth was crowned, and faith was kept,"
245,II.,"Ere friendship grew a snare, or love waxed cold--"
246,II.,Those pure and happy times--the golden days of old.
247,II.,

249,III.,III.
250,III.,
251,III.,"Peace to the just man's memory,--let it grow"
252,III.,"Greener with years, and blossom through the flight"
253,III.,Of ages; let the mimic canvas show
254,III.,His calm benevolent features; let the light
255,III.,"Stream on his deeds of love, that shunned the sight"
256,III.,"Of all but heaven, and in the book of fame,"
257,III.,"The glorious record of his virtues write,"
258,III.,"And hold it up to men, and bid them claim"
259,III.,"A palm like his, and catch from him the hallowed flame."
260,III.,
261,III.,
262,IV.,IV.
263,IV.,
264,IV.,"But oh, despair not of their fate who rise"
265,IV.,To dwell upon the earth when we withdraw!
266,IV.,"Lo! the same shaft by which the righteous dies,"
267,IV.,"Strikes through the wretch that scoffed at mercy's law,"
268,IV.,"And trode his brethren down, and felt no awe"
269,IV.,"Of Him who will avenge them. Stainless worth,"
270,IV.,"Such as the sternest age of virtue saw,"
271,IV.,"Ripens, meanwhile, till time shall call it forth"
272,IV.,"From the low modest shade, to light and bless the earth."
273,IV.,
274,IV.,
275,V.,V.
276,V.,
277,V.,"Has Nature, in her calm, majestic march"
278,V.,Faltered with age at last? does the bright sun
279,V.,"Grow dim in heaven? or, in their far blue arch,"
280,V.,"Sparkle the crowd of stars, when day is done,"
281,V.,"Less brightly? when the dew-lipped Spring comes on,"
282,V.,"Breathes she with airs less soft, or scents the sky"
283,V.,With flowers less fair than when her reign begun?
284,V.,"Does prodigal Autumn, to our age, deny"
285,V.,The plenty that once swelled beneath his sober eye?
286,V.,
287,V.,
288,VI.,VI.
289,VI.,
290,VI.,"Look on this beautiful world, and read the truth"
291,VI.,"In her fair page; see, every season brings"
292,VI.,"New change, to her, of everlasting youth;"
293,VI.,"Still the green soil, with joyous living things,"
294,VI.,"Swarms, the wide air is full of joyous wings,"
295,VI.,"And myriads, still, are happy in the sleep"
296,VI.,"Of ocean's azure gulfs, and where he flings"
297,VI.,The restless surge. Eternal Love doth keep
298,VI.,"In his complacent arms, the earth, the air, the deep."
299,VI.,
300,VI.,
301,VII.,VII.
302,VII.,
303,VII.,"Will then the merciful One, who stamped our race"
304,VII.,"With his own image, and who gave them sway"
305,VII.,"O'er earth, and the glad dwellers on her face,"
306,VII.,Now that our swarming nations far away
307,VII.,"Are spread, where'er the moist earth drinks the day,"
308,VII.,Forget the ancient care that taught and nursed
309,VII.,His latest offspring? will he quench the ray
310,VII.,"Infused by his own forming smile at first,"
311,VII.,And leave a work so fair all blighted and accursed?
312,VII.,
313,VII.,
314,VIII.,VIII.
315,VIII.,
316,VIII.,"Oh, no! a thousand cheerful omens give"
317,VIII.,"Hope of yet happier days, whose dawn is nigh."
318,VIII.,"He who has tamed the elements, shall not live"
319,VIII.,The slave of his own passions; he whose eye
320,VIII.,"Unwinds the eternal dances of the sky,"
321,VIII.,And in the abyss of brightness dares to span
322,VIII.,"The sun's broad circle, rising yet more high,"
323,VIII.,In God's magnificent works his will shall scan--
324,VIII.,And love and peace shall make their paradise with man.
325,VIII.,
326,VIII.,
327,IX.,IX.
328,IX.,
329,IX.,Sit at the feet of history--through the night
330,IX.,"Of years the steps of virtue she shall trace,"
331,IX.,"And show the earlier ages, where her sight"
332,IX.,Can pierce the eternal shadows o'er their face;--
333,IX.,"When, from the genial cradle of our race,"
334,IX.,"Went forth the tribes of men, their pleasant lot"
335,IX.,"To choose, where palm-groves cooled their dwelling-place,"
336,IX.,Or freshening rivers ran; and there forgot
337,IX.,"The truth of heaven, and kneeled to gods that heard them not."
338,IX.,
339,IX.,
340,X.,X.
341,X.,
342,X.,"Then waited not the murderer for the night,"
343,X.,"But smote his brother down in the bright day,"
344,X.,"And he who felt the wrong, and had the might,"
345,X.,"His own avenger, girt himself to slay;"
346,X.,Beside the path the unburied carcass lay;
347,X.,"The shepherd, by the fountains of the glen,"
348,X.,"Fled, while the robber swept his flock away,"
349,X.,"And slew his babes. The sick, untended then,"
350,X.,"Languished in the damp shade, and died afar from men."
351,X.,
352,X.,
353,XI.,XI.
354,XI.,
355,XI.,But misery brought in love--in passion's strife
356,XI.,"Man gave his heart to mercy, pleading long,"
357,XI.,And sought out gentle deeds to gladden life;
358,XI.,"The weak, against the sons of spoil and wrong,"
359,XI.,"Banded, and watched their hamlets, and grew strong."
360,XI.,"States rose, and, in the shadow of their might,"
361,XI.,"The timid rested. To the reverent throng,"
362,XI.,"Grave and time-wrinkled men, with locks all white,"
363,XI.,"Gave laws, and judged their strifes, and taught the way of right;"
364,XI.,
365,XI.,
366,XII.,XII.
367,XII.,
368,XII.,"Till bolder spirits seized the rule, and nailed"
369,XII.,"On men the yoke that man should never bear,"
370,XII.,And drove them forth to battle. Lo! unveiled
371,XII.,The scene of those stern ages! What is there!
372,XII.,"A boundless sea of blood, and the wild air"
373,XII.,Moans with the crimson surges that entomb
374,XII.,Cities and bannered armies; forms that wear
375,XII.,"The kingly circlet rise, amid the gloom,"
376,XII.,"O'er the dark wave, and straight are swallowed in its womb."
377,XII.,
378,XII.,
379,XIII.,XIII.
380,XIII.,
381,XIII.,Those ages have no memory--but they left
382,XIII.,A record in the desert--columns strown
383,XIII.,"On the waste sands, and statues fallen and cleft,"
384,XIII.,Heaped like a host in battle overthrown;
385,XIII.,"Vast ruins, where the mountain's ribs of stone"
386,XIII.,Were hewn into a city; streets that spread
387,XIII.,"In the dark earth, where never breath has blown"
388,XIII.,"Of heaven's sweet air, nor foot of man dares tread"
389,XIII.,The long and perilous ways--the Cities of the Dead:
390,XIII.,
391,XIII.,
392,XIV.,XIV.
393,XIV.,
394,XIV.,And tombs of monarchs to the clouds up-piled--
395,XIV.,They perished--but the eternal tombs remain--
396,XIV.,"And the black precipice, abrupt and wild,"
397,XIV.,Pierced by long toil and hollowed to a fane;--
398,XIV.,Huge piers and frowning forms of gods sustain
399,XIV.,"The everlasting arches, dark and wide,"
400,XIV.,"Like the night-heaven, when clouds are black with rain."
401,XIV.,"But idly skill was tasked, and strength was plied,"
402,XIV.,All was the work of slaves to swell a despot's pride.
403,XIV.,
404,XIV.,
405,XV.,XV.
406,XV.,
407,XV.,"And Virtue cannot dwell with slaves, nor reign"
408,XV.,O'er those who cower to take a tyrant's yoke;
409,XV.,"She left the down-trod nations in disdain,"
410,XV.,"And flew to Greece, when Liberty awoke,"
411,XV.,"New-born, amid those glorious vales, and broke"
412,XV.,Sceptre and chain with her fair youthful hands:
413,XV.,As rocks are shivered in the thunder-stroke.
414,XV.,"And lo! in full-grown strength, an empire stands"
415,XV.,"Of leagued and rival states, the wonder of the lands."
416,XV.,
417,XV.,
418,XVI.,XVI.
419,XVI.,
420,XVI.,"Oh, Greece! thy flourishing cities were a spoil"
421,XVI.,Unto each other; thy hard hand oppressed
422,XVI.,And crushed the helpless; thou didst make thy soil
423,XVI.,Drunk with the blood of those that loved thee best;
424,XVI.,"And thou didst drive, from thy unnatural breast,"
425,XVI.,Thy just and brave to die in distant climes;
426,XVI.,"Earth shuddered at thy deeds, and sighed for rest"
427,XVI.,"From thine abominations; after times,"
428,XVI.,"That yet shall read thy tale, will tremble at thy crimes."
429,XVI.,
430,XVI.,
431,XVII.,XVII.
432,XVII.,
433,XVII.,Yet there was that within thee which has saved
434,XVII.,"Thy glory, and redeemed thy blotted name;"
435,XVII.,"The story of thy better deeds, engraved"
436,XVII.,"On fame's unmouldering pillar, puts to shame"
437,XVII.,Our chiller virtue; the high art to tame
438,XVII.,The whirlwind of the passions was thine own;
439,XVII.,"And the pure ray, that from thy bosom came,"
440,XVII.,"Far over many a land and age has shone,"
441,XVII.,And mingles with the light that beams from God's own throne;
442,XVII.,
443,XVII.,
444,XVIII.,XVIII.
445,XVIII.,
446,XVIII.,"And Rome--thy sterner, younger sister, she"
447,XVIII.,Who awed the world with her imperial frown--
448,XVIII.,"Rome drew the spirit of her race from thee,--"
449,XVIII.,The rival of thy shame and thy renown.
450,XVIII.,Yet her degenerate children sold the crown
451,XVIII.,Of earth's wide kingdoms to a line of slaves;
452,XVIII.,"Guilt reigned, and we with guilt, and plagues came down,"
453,XVIII.,"Till the north broke its floodgates, and the waves"
454,XVIII.,"Whelmed the degraded race, and weltered o'er their graves."
455,XVIII.,
456,XVIII.,
457,XIX.,XIX.
458,XIX.,
459,XIX.,"Vainly that ray of brightness from above,"
460,XIX.,"That shone around the Galilean lake,"
461,XIX.,"The light of hope, the leading star of love,"
462,XIX.,"Struggled, the darkness of that day to break;"
463,XIX.,"Even its own faithless guardians strove to slake,"
464,XIX.,"In fogs of earth, the pure immortal flame;"
465,XIX.,"And priestly hands, for Jesus' blessed sake,"
466,XIX.,"Were red with blood, and charity became,"
467,XIX.,"In that stern war of forms, a mockery and a name."
468,XIX.,
469,XIX.,
470,XX.,XX.
471,XX.,
472,XX.,"They triumphed, and less bloody rites were kept"
473,XX.,Within the quiet of the convent cell:
474,XX.,"The well-fed inmates pattered prayer, and slept,"
475,XX.,"And sinned, and liked their easy penance well."
476,XX.,"Where pleasant was the spot for men to dwell,"
477,XX.,"Amid its fair broad lands the abbey lay,"
478,XX.,"Sheltering dark orgies that were shame to tell,"
479,XX.,"And cowled and barefoot beggars swarmed the way,"
480,XX.,"All in their convent weeds, of black, and white, and gray."
481,XX.,
482,XX.,
483,XXI.,XXI.
484,XXI.,
485,XXI.,"Oh, sweetly the returning muses' strain"
486,XXI.,"Swelled over that famed stream, whose gentle tide"
487,XXI.,"In their bright lap the Etrurian vales detain,"
488,XXI.,"Sweet, as when winter storms have ceased to chide,"
489,XXI.,"And all the new-leaved woods, resounding wide,"
490,XXI.,Send out wild hymns upon the scented air.
491,XXI.,Lo! to the smiling Arno's classic side
492,XXI.,"The emulous nations of the west repair,"
493,XXI.,"And kindle their quenched urns, and drink fresh spirit there."
494,XXI.,
495,XXI.,
496,XXII.,XXII.
497,XXII.,
498,XXII.,"Still, Heaven deferred the hour ordained to rend"
499,XXII.,From saintly rottenness the sacred stole;
500,XXII.,And cowl and worshipped shrine could still defend
501,XXII.,The wretch with felon stains upon his soul;
502,XXII.,"And crimes were set to sale, and hard his dole"
503,XXII.,Who could not bribe a passage to the skies;
504,XXII.,"And vice, beneath the mitre's kind control,"
505,XXII.,"Sinned gaily on, and grew to giant size,"
506,XXII.,"Shielded by priestly power, and watched by priestly eyes."
507,XXII.,
508,XXII.,
509,XXIII.,XXIII.
510,XXIII.,
511,XXIII.,"At last the earthquake came--the shock, that hurled"
512,XXIII.,"To dust, in many fragments dashed and strown,"
513,XXIII.,"The throne, whose roots were in another world,"
514,XXIII.,And whose far-stretching shadow awed our own.
515,XXIII.,"From many a proud monastic pile, o'erthrown,"
516,XXIII.,"Fear-struck, the hooded inmates rushed and fled;"
517,XXIII.,"The web, that for a thousand years had grown"
518,XXIII.,"O'er prostrate Europe, in that day of dread"
519,XXIII.,"Crumbled and fell, as fire dissolves the flaxen thread."

948,GREEN RIVER.,
949,GREEN RIVER.,Yet pure its waters--its shallows are bright
950,GREEN RIVER.,"With coloured pebbles and sparkles of light,"
951,GREEN RIVER.,"And clear the depths where its eddies play,"
952,GREEN RIVER.,"And dimples deepen and whirl away,"
953,GREEN RIVER.,And the plane-tree's speckled arms o'ershoot
954,GREEN RIVER.,"The swifter current that mines its root,"
955,GREEN RIVER.,"Through whose shifting leaves, as you walk the hill,"
956,GREEN RIVER.,The quivering glimmer of sun and rill
957,GREEN RIVER.,"With a sudden flash on the eye is thrown,"
958,GREEN RIVER.,Like the ray that streams from the diamond stone.

963,GREEN RIVER.,And sweetest the golden autumn day
964,GREEN RIVER.,In silence and sunshine glides away.
965,GREEN RIVER.,
966,GREEN RIVER.,"Yet fair as thou art, thou shunnest to glide,"
967,GREEN RIVER.,Beautiful stream! by the village side;
968,GREEN RIVER.,"But windest away from haunts of men,"
969,GREEN RIVER.,To quiet valley and shaded glen;
970,GREEN RIVER.,"And forest, and meadow, and slope of hill,"
971,GREEN RIVER.,"Around thee, are lonely, lovely, and still."
972,GREEN RIVER.,"Lonely--save when, by thy rippling tides,"
973,GREEN RIVER.,From thicket to thicket the angler glides;
974,GREEN RIVER.,"Or the simpler comes with basket and book,"
975,GREEN RIVER.,For herbs of power on thy banks to look;
976,GREEN RIVER.,"Or haply, some idle dreamer, like me,"
977,GREEN RIVER.,"To wander, and muse, and gaze on thee."
978,GREEN RIVER.,Still--save the chirp of birds that feed
979,GREEN RIVER.,"On the river cherry and seedy reed,"
980,GREEN RIVER.,And thy own wild music gushing out
981,GREEN RIVER.,"With mellow murmur and fairy shout,"
982,GREEN RIVER.,"From dawn to the blush of another day,"
983,GREEN RIVER.,Like traveller singing along his way.
984,GREEN RIVER.,
985,GREEN RIVER.,"That fairy music I never hear,"
986,GREEN RIVER.,"Nor gaze on those waters so green and clear,"
987,GREEN RIVER.,"And mark them winding away from sight,"
988,GREEN RIVER.,"Darkened with shade or flashing with light,"
989,GREEN RIVER.,"While o'er them the vine to its thicket clings,"
990,GREEN RIVER.,"And the zephyr stoops to freshen his wings,"
991,GREEN RIVER.,But I wish that fate had left me free
992,GREEN RIVER.,"To wander these quiet haunts with thee,"
993,GREEN RIVER.,"Till the eating cares of earth should depart,"
994,GREEN RIVER.,And the peace of the scene pass into my heart;
995,GREEN RIVER.,"And I envy thy stream, as it glides along,"
996,GREEN RIVER.,Through its beautiful banks in a trance of song.
997,GREEN RIVER.,
998,GREEN RIVER.,"Though forced to drudge for the dregs of men,"
999,GREEN RIVER.,"And scrawl strange words with the barbarous pen,"
1000,GREEN RIVER.,"And mingle among the jostling crowd,"
1001,GREEN RIVER.,Where the sons of strife are subtle and loud--
1002,GREEN RIVER.,"I often come to this quiet place,"
1003,GREEN RIVER.,"To breathe the airs that ruffle thy face,"
1004,GREEN RIVER.,"And gaze upon thee in silent dream,"
1005,GREEN RIVER.,For in thy lonely and lovely stream
1006,GREEN RIVER.,An image of that calm life appears

1012,A WINTER PIECE.,A WINTER PIECE.
1013,A WINTER PIECE.,
1014,A WINTER PIECE.,
1015,A WINTER PIECE.,"The time has been that these wild solitudes,"
1016,A WINTER PIECE.,"Yet beautiful as wild, were trod by me"
1017,A WINTER PIECE.,Oftener than now; and when the ills of life
1018,A WINTER PIECE.,Had chafed my spirit--when the unsteady pulse
1019,A WINTER PIECE.,Beat with strange flutterings--I would wander forth
1020,A WINTER PIECE.,And seek the woods. The sunshine on my path
1021,A WINTER PIECE.,"Was to me as a friend. The swelling hills,"
1022,A WINTER PIECE.,"The quiet dells retiring far between,"
1023,A WINTER PIECE.,With gentle invitation to explore
1024,A WINTER PIECE.,"Their windings, were a calm society"
1025,A WINTER PIECE.,That talked with me and soothed me. Then the chant
1026,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of birds, and chime of brooks, and soft caress"
1027,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of the fresh sylvan air, made me forget"
1028,A WINTER PIECE.,"The thoughts that broke my peace, and I began"
1029,A WINTER PIECE.,"To gather simples by the fountain's brink,"
1030,A WINTER PIECE.,And lose myself in day-dreams. While I stood
1031,A WINTER PIECE.,"In nature's loneliness, I was with one"
1032,A WINTER PIECE.,"With whom I early grew familiar, one"
1033,A WINTER PIECE.,"Who never had a frown for me, whose voice"
1034,A WINTER PIECE.,Never rebuked me for the hours I stole
1035,A WINTER PIECE.,"From cares I loved not, but of which the world"
1036,A WINTER PIECE.,"Deems highest, to converse with her. When shrieked"
1037,A WINTER PIECE.,"The bleak November winds, and smote the woods,"
1038,A WINTER PIECE.,"And the brown fields were herbless, and the shades,"
1039,A WINTER PIECE.,"That met above the merry rivulet,"
1040,A WINTER PIECE.,"Were spoiled, I sought, I loved them still,--they seemed"
1041,A WINTER PIECE.,Like old companions in adversity.
1042,A WINTER PIECE.,"Still there was beauty in my walks; the brook,"
1043,A WINTER PIECE.,"Bordered with sparkling frost-work, was as gay"
1044,A WINTER PIECE.,"As with its fringe of summer flowers. Afar,"
1045,A WINTER PIECE.,"The village with its spires, the path of streams,"
1046,A WINTER PIECE.,"And dim receding valleys, hid before"
1047,A WINTER PIECE.,"By interposing trees, lay visible"
1048,A WINTER PIECE.,"Through the bare grove, and my familiar haunts"
1049,A WINTER PIECE.,Seemed new to me. Nor was I slow to come
1050,A WINTER PIECE.,"Among them, when the clouds, from their still skirts,"
1051,A WINTER PIECE.,"Had shaken down on earth the feathery snow,"
1052,A WINTER PIECE.,"And all was white. The pure keen air abroad,"
1053,A WINTER PIECE.,"Albeit it breathed no scent of herb, nor heard"
1054,A WINTER PIECE.,"Love-call of bird, nor merry hum of bee,"
1055,A WINTER PIECE.,Was not the air of death. Bright mosses crept
1056,A WINTER PIECE.,"Over the spotted trunks, and the close buds,"
1057,A WINTER PIECE.,"That lay along the boughs, instinct with life,"
1058,A WINTER PIECE.,"Patient, and waiting the soft breath of Spring,"
1059,A WINTER PIECE.,Feared not the piercing spirit of the North.
1060,A WINTER PIECE.,"The snow-bird twittered on the beechen bough,"
1061,A WINTER PIECE.,"And 'neath the hemlock, whose thick branches bent"
1062,A WINTER PIECE.,"Beneath its bright cold burden, and kept dry"
1063,A WINTER PIECE.,"A circle, on the earth, of withered leaves,"
1064,A WINTER PIECE.,The partridge found a shelter. Through the snow
1065,A WINTER PIECE.,The rabbit sprang away. The lighter track
1066,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of fox, and the racoon's broad path, were there,"
1067,A WINTER PIECE.,"Crossing each other. From his hollow tree,"
1068,A WINTER PIECE.,"The squirrel was abroad, gathering the nuts"
1069,A WINTER PIECE.,"Just fallen, that asked the winter cold and sway"
1070,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of winter blast, to shake them from their hold."
1071,A WINTER PIECE.,
1072,A WINTER PIECE.,"But Winter has yet brighter scenes,--he boasts"
1073,A WINTER PIECE.,Splendours beyond what gorgeous Summer knows;
1074,A WINTER PIECE.,"Or Autumn with his many fruits, and woods"
1075,A WINTER PIECE.,All flushed with many hues. Come when the rains
1076,A WINTER PIECE.,"Have glazed the snow, and clothed the trees with ice;"
1077,A WINTER PIECE.,While the slant sun of February pours
1078,A WINTER PIECE.,Into the bowers a flood of light. Approach!
1079,A WINTER PIECE.,"The incrusted surface shall upbear thy steps,"
1080,A WINTER PIECE.,And the broad arching portals of the grove
1081,A WINTER PIECE.,Welcome thy entering. Look! the massy trunks
1082,A WINTER PIECE.,"Are cased in the pure crystal; each light spray,"
1083,A WINTER PIECE.,"Nodding and tinkling in the breath of heaven,"
1084,A WINTER PIECE.,"Is studded with its trembling water-drops,"
1085,A WINTER PIECE.,That stream with rainbow radiance as they move.
1086,A WINTER PIECE.,But round the parent stem the long low boughs
1087,A WINTER PIECE.,"Bend, in a glittering ring, and arbours hide"
1088,A WINTER PIECE.,The glassy floor. Oh! you might deem the spot
1089,A WINTER PIECE.,"The spacious cavern of some virgin mine,"
1090,A WINTER PIECE.,"Deep in the womb of earth--where the gems grow,"
1091,A WINTER PIECE.,And diamonds put forth radiant rods and bud
1092,A WINTER PIECE.,With amethyst and topaz--and the place
1093,A WINTER PIECE.,"Lit up, most royally, with the pure beam"
1094,A WINTER PIECE.,That dwells in them. Or haply the vast hall
1095,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of fairy palace, that outlasts the night,"
1096,A WINTER PIECE.,And fades not in the glory of the sun;--
1097,A WINTER PIECE.,Where crystal columns send forth slender shafts
1098,A WINTER PIECE.,And crossing arches; and fantastic aisles
1099,A WINTER PIECE.,"Wind from the sight in brightness, and are lost"
1100,A WINTER PIECE.,"Among the crowded pillars. Raise thine eye,--"
1101,A WINTER PIECE.,"Thou seest no cavern roof, no palace vault;"
1102,A WINTER PIECE.,There the blue sky and the white drifting cloud
1103,A WINTER PIECE.,Look in. Again the wildered fancy dreams
1104,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of spouting fountains, frozen as they rose,"
1105,A WINTER PIECE.,"And fixed, with all their branching jets, in air,"
1106,A WINTER PIECE.,"And all their sluices sealed. All, all is light;"
1107,A WINTER PIECE.,Light without shade. But all shall pass away
1108,A WINTER PIECE.,"With the next sun. From numberless vast trunks,"
1109,A WINTER PIECE.,"Loosened, the crashing ice shall make a sound"
1110,A WINTER PIECE.,"Like the far roar of rivers, and the eve"
1111,A WINTER PIECE.,Shall close o'er the brown woods as it was wont.
1112,A WINTER PIECE.,
1113,A WINTER PIECE.,"And it is pleasant, when the noisy streams"
1114,A WINTER PIECE.,"Are just set free, and milder suns melt off"
1115,A WINTER PIECE.,"The plashy snow, save only the firm drift"
1116,A WINTER PIECE.,"In the deep glen or the close shade of pines,--"
1117,A WINTER PIECE.,'Tis pleasant to behold the wreaths of smoke
1118,A WINTER PIECE.,"Roll up among the maples of the hill,"
1119,A WINTER PIECE.,Where the shrill sound of youthful voices wakes
1120,A WINTER PIECE.,"The shriller echo, as the clear pure lymph,"
1121,A WINTER PIECE.,"That from the wounded trees, in twinkling drops,"
1122,A WINTER PIECE.,"Falls, mid the golden brightness of the morn,"
1123,A WINTER PIECE.,"Is gathered in with brimming pails, and oft,"
1124,A WINTER PIECE.,"Wielded by sturdy hands, the stroke of axe"
1125,A WINTER PIECE.,"Makes the woods ring. Along the quiet air,"
1126,A WINTER PIECE.,"Come and float calmly off the soft light clouds,"
1127,A WINTER PIECE.,"Such as you see in summer, and the winds"
1128,A WINTER PIECE.,"Scarce stir the branches. Lodged in sunny cleft,"
1129,A WINTER PIECE.,"Where the cold breezes come not, blooms alone"
1130,A WINTER PIECE.,"The little wind-flower, whose just opened eye"
1131,A WINTER PIECE.,Is blue as the spring heaven it gazes at--
1132,A WINTER PIECE.,Startling the loiterer in the naked groves
1133,A WINTER PIECE.,"With unexpected beauty, for the time"
1134,A WINTER PIECE.,Of blossoms and green leaves is yet afar.
1135,A WINTER PIECE.,"And ere it comes, the encountering winds shall oft"
1136,A WINTER PIECE.,"Muster their wrath again, and rapid clouds"
1137,A WINTER PIECE.,"Shade heaven, and bounding on the frozen earth"
1138,A WINTER PIECE.,"Shall fall their volleyed stores rounded like hail,"
1139,A WINTER PIECE.,"And white like snow, and the loud North again"
1140,A WINTER PIECE.,Shall buffet the vexed forest in his rage.

1355,A WALK AT SUNSET.,
1356,A WALK AT SUNSET.,"For ages, on the silent forests here,"
1357,A WALK AT SUNSET.,Thy beams did fall before the red man came
1358,A WALK AT SUNSET.,To dwell beneath them; in their shade the deer

1402,HYMN TO DEATH.,And mocked thee. On thy dim and shadowy brow
1403,HYMN TO DEATH.,"They place an iron crown, and call thee king"

1405,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Deadly assassin, that strik'st down the fair,"

1414,HYMN TO DEATH.,And thou from some I love wilt take a life
1415,HYMN TO DEATH.,Dear to me as my own. Yet while the spell

1417,HYMN TO DEATH.,"In sight of all thy trophies, face to face,"
1418,HYMN TO DEATH.,Meet is it that my voice should utter forth
1419,HYMN TO DEATH.,Thy nobler triumphs; I will teach the world

1421,HYMN TO DEATH.,"The living!--they who never felt thy power,"

1423,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Whose crimes are ripe, his sufferings when thy hand"

1425,HYMN TO DEATH.,Are writ among thy praises. But the good--
1426,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Does he whom thy kind hand dismissed to peace,"
1427,HYMN TO DEATH.,Upbraid the gentle violence that took off
1428,HYMN TO DEATH.,"His fetters, and unbarred his prison cell?"
1429,HYMN TO DEATH.,
1430,HYMN TO DEATH.,Raise then the hymn to Death. Deliverer!
1431,HYMN TO DEATH.,God hath anointed thee to free the oppressed
1432,HYMN TO DEATH.,"And crush the oppressor. When the armed chief,"

1436,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Thou, while his head is loftiest and his heart"

1438,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Almighty, thou dost set thy sudden grasp"
1439,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Upon him, and the links of that strong chain"
1440,HYMN TO DEATH.,That bound mankind are crumbled; thou dost break
1441,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Sceptre and crown, and beat his throne to dust."
1442,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Then the earth shouts with gladness, and her tribes"
1443,HYMN TO DEATH.,Gather within their ancient bounds again.

1455,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Drop lifeless, and the pitiless heart is cold."
1456,HYMN TO DEATH.,Thou too dost purge from earth its horrible

1462,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Cumber the weedy courts, and for loud hymns,"
1463,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Chanted by kneeling multitudes, the wind"
1464,HYMN TO DEATH.,Shrieks in the solitary aisles. When he
1465,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Who gives his life to guilt, and laughs at all"
1466,HYMN TO DEATH.,"The laws that God or man has made, and round"
1467,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Hedges his seat with power, and shines in wealth,--"
1468,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Lifts up his atheist front to scoff at Heaven,"
1469,HYMN TO DEATH.,"And celebrates his shame in open day,"
1470,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Thou, in the pride of all his crimes, cutt'st off"
1471,HYMN TO DEATH.,"The horrible example. Touched by thine,"
1472,HYMN TO DEATH.,The extortioner's hard hand foregoes the gold
1473,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Wrung from the o'er-worn poor. The perjurer,"
1474,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Whose tongue was lithe, e'en now, and voluble"
1475,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Against his neighbour's life, and he who laughed"
1476,HYMN TO DEATH.,And leaped for joy to see a spotless fame
1477,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Blasted before his own foul calumnies,"
1478,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Are smit with deadly silence. He, who sold"

1480,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Even while he hugs himself on his escape,"
1481,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Trembles, as, doubly terrible, at length,"
1482,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Thy steps o'ertake him, and there is no time"
1483,HYMN TO DEATH.,For parley--nor will bribes unclench thy grasp.
1484,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Oft, too, dost thou reform thy victim, long"
1485,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Ere his last hour. And when the reveller,"
1486,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Mad in the chase of pleasure, stretches on,"
1487,HYMN TO DEATH.,"And strains each nerve, and clears the path of life"
1488,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Like wind, thou point'st him to the dreadful goal,"
1489,HYMN TO DEATH.,"And shak'st thy hour-glass in his reeling eye,"
1490,HYMN TO DEATH.,And check'st him in mid course. Thy skeleton hand
1491,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Shows to the faint of spirit the right path,"
1492,HYMN TO DEATH.,"And he is warned, and fears to step aside."
1493,HYMN TO DEATH.,Thou sett'st between the ruffian and his crime
1494,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Thy ghastly countenance, and his slack hand"
1495,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Drops the drawn knife. But, oh, most fearfully"
1496,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Dost thou show forth Heaven's justice, when thy shafts"
1497,HYMN TO DEATH.,Drink up the ebbing spirit--then the hard
1498,HYMN TO DEATH.,Of heart and violent of hand restores
1499,HYMN TO DEATH.,The treasure to the friendless wretch he wronged.
1500,HYMN TO DEATH.,Then from the writhing bosom thou dost pluck
1501,HYMN TO DEATH.,"The guilty secret; lips, for ages sealed,"
1502,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Are faithless to the dreadful trust at length,"
1503,HYMN TO DEATH.,And give it up; the felon's latest breath
1504,HYMN TO DEATH.,Absolves the innocent man who bears his crime;
1505,HYMN TO DEATH.,"The slanderer, horror-smitten, and in tears,"
1506,HYMN TO DEATH.,Recalls the deadly obloquy he forged
1507,HYMN TO DEATH.,To work his brother's ruin. Thou dost make
1508,HYMN TO DEATH.,Thy penitent victim utter to the air
1509,HYMN TO DEATH.,"The dark conspiracy that strikes at life,"
1510,HYMN TO DEATH.,And aims to whelm the laws; ere yet the hour
1511,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Is come, and the dread sign of murder given."

1513,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Thus, from the first of time, hast thou been found"
1514,HYMN TO DEATH.,"On virtue's side; the wicked, but for thee,"
1515,HYMN TO DEATH.,Had been too strong for the good; the great of earth
1516,HYMN TO DEATH.,Had crushed the weak for ever. Schooled in guile
1517,HYMN TO DEATH.,"For ages, while each passing year had brought"
1518,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Its baneful lesson, they had filled the world"
1519,HYMN TO DEATH.,"With their abominations; while its tribes,"
1520,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Trodden to earth, imbruted, and despoiled,"
1521,HYMN TO DEATH.,Had knelt to them in worship; sacrifice
1522,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Had smoked on many an altar, temple roofs"
1523,HYMN TO DEATH.,Had echoed with the blasphemous prayer and hymn:
1524,HYMN TO DEATH.,"But thou, the great reformer of the world,"
1525,HYMN TO DEATH.,Tak'st off the sons of violence and fraud
1526,HYMN TO DEATH.,"In their green pupilage, their lore half learned--"
1527,HYMN TO DEATH.,Ere guilt had quite o'errun the simple heart
1528,HYMN TO DEATH.,"God gave them at their birth, and blotted out"
1529,HYMN TO DEATH.,"His image. Thou dost mark them flushed with hope,"
1530,HYMN TO DEATH.,As on the threshold of their vast designs
1531,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Doubtful and loose they stand, and strik'st them down."

1535,HYMN TO DEATH.,Alas! I little thought that the stern power
1536,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Whose fearful praise I sung, would try me thus"
1537,HYMN TO DEATH.,Before the strain was ended. It must cease--
1538,HYMN TO DEATH.,For he is in his grave who taught my youth
1539,HYMN TO DEATH.,"The art of verse, and in the bud of life"
1540,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Offered me to the muses. Oh, cut off"
1541,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Untimely! when thy reason in its strength,"
1542,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Ripened by years of toil and studious search,"
1543,HYMN TO DEATH.,"And watch of Nature's silent lessons, taught"
1544,HYMN TO DEATH.,Thy hand to practise best the lenient art
1545,HYMN TO DEATH.,"To which thou gavest thy laborious days,"
1546,HYMN TO DEATH.,"And, last, thy life. And, therefore, when the earth"
1547,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Received thee, tears were in unyielding eyes"
1548,HYMN TO DEATH.,"And on hard cheeks, and they who deemed thy skill"
1549,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Delayed their death-hour, shuddered and turned pale"
1550,HYMN TO DEATH.,"When thou wert gone. This faltering verse, which thou"
1551,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Shalt not, as wont, o'erlook, is all I have"
1552,HYMN TO DEATH.,To offer at thy grave--this--and the hope
1553,HYMN TO DEATH.,"To copy thy example, and to leave"
1554,HYMN TO DEATH.,A name of which the wretched shall not think
1555,HYMN TO DEATH.,"As of an enemy's, whom they forgive"
1556,HYMN TO DEATH.,"As all forgive the dead. Rest, therefore, thou"
1557,HYMN TO DEATH.,Whose early guidance trained my infant steps--
1558,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Rest, in the bosom of God, till the brief sleep"
1559,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Of death is over, and a happier life"
1560,HYMN TO DEATH.,Shall dawn to waken thine insensible dust.
1561,HYMN TO DEATH.,
1562,HYMN TO DEATH.,Now thou art not--and yet the men whose guilt
1563,HYMN TO DEATH.,Has wearied Heaven for vengeance--he who bears
1564,HYMN TO DEATH.,"False witness--he who takes the orphan's bread,"
1565,HYMN TO DEATH.,And robs the widow--he who spreads abroad
1566,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Polluted hands of mockery of prayer,"
1567,HYMN TO DEATH.,Are left to cumber earth. Shuddering I look
1568,HYMN TO DEATH.,"On what is written, yet I blot not out"

3011,A FOREST HYMN.,The groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned
3012,A FOREST HYMN.,"To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave,"
3013,A FOREST HYMN.,"And spread the roof above them,--ere he framed"
3014,A FOREST HYMN.,"The lofty vault, to gather and roll back"
3015,A FOREST HYMN.,"The sound of anthems; in the darkling wood,"
3016,A FOREST HYMN.,"Amidst the cool and silence, he knelt down,"
3017,A FOREST HYMN.,And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks
3018,A FOREST HYMN.,And supplication. For his simple heart
3019,A FOREST HYMN.,Might not resist the sacred influences
3020,A FOREST HYMN.,"Which, from the stilly twilight of the place,"
3021,A FOREST HYMN.,And from the gray old trunks that high in heaven
3022,A FOREST HYMN.,"Mingled their mossy boughs, and from the sound"
3023,A FOREST HYMN.,Of the invisible breath that swayed at once
3024,A FOREST HYMN.,"All their green tops, stole over him, and bowed"
3025,A FOREST HYMN.,His spirit with the thought of boundless power
3026,A FOREST HYMN.,"And inaccessible majesty. Ah, why"
3027,A FOREST HYMN.,"Should we, in the world's riper years, neglect"
3028,A FOREST HYMN.,"God's ancient sanctuaries, and adore"
3029,A FOREST HYMN.,"Only among the crowd, and under roofs"
3030,A FOREST HYMN.,"That our frail hands have raised? Let me, at least,"
3031,A FOREST HYMN.,"Here, in the shadow of this aged wood,"
3032,A FOREST HYMN.,"Offer one hymn--thrice happy, if it find"
3033,A FOREST HYMN.,Acceptance in His ear.
3034,A FOREST HYMN.,
3035,A FOREST HYMN.,"Father, thy hand"
3036,A FOREST HYMN.,"Hath reared these venerable columns, thou"
3037,A FOREST HYMN.,Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down
3038,A FOREST HYMN.,"Upon the naked earth, and, forthwith, rose"
3039,A FOREST HYMN.,"All these fair ranks of trees. They, in thy sun,"
3040,A FOREST HYMN.,"Budded, and shook their green leaves in thy breeze,"
3041,A FOREST HYMN.,"And shot towards heaven. The century-living crow,"
3042,A FOREST HYMN.,"Whose birth was in their tops, grew old and died"
3043,A FOREST HYMN.,"Among their branches, till, at last, they stood,"
3044,A FOREST HYMN.,"As now they stand, massy, and tall, and dark,"
3045,A FOREST HYMN.,Fit shrine for humble worshipper to hold
3046,A FOREST HYMN.,"Communion with his Maker. These dim vaults,"
3047,A FOREST HYMN.,"These winding aisles, of human pomp or pride"
3048,A FOREST HYMN.,Report not. No fantasting carvings show
3049,A FOREST HYMN.,The boast of our vain race to change the form
3050,A FOREST HYMN.,Of thy fair works. But thou art here--thou fill'st
3051,A FOREST HYMN.,The solitude. Thou art in the soft winds
3052,A FOREST HYMN.,That run along the summit of these trees
3053,A FOREST HYMN.,In music;--thou art in the cooler breath
3054,A FOREST HYMN.,That from the inmost darkness of the place
3055,A FOREST HYMN.,"Comes, scarcely felt; the barky trunks, the ground,"
3056,A FOREST HYMN.,"The fresh moist ground, are all instinct with thee."
3057,A FOREST HYMN.,"Here is continual worship;--nature, here,"
3058,A FOREST HYMN.,"In the tranquillity that thou dost love,"
3059,A FOREST HYMN.,"Enjoys thy presence. Noiselessly, around,"
3060,A FOREST HYMN.,"From perch to perch, the solitary bird"
3061,A FOREST HYMN.,"Passes: and yon clear spring, that, midst its herbs,"
3062,A FOREST HYMN.,Wells softly forth and visits the strong roots
3063,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of half the mighty forest, tells no tale"
3064,A FOREST HYMN.,Of all the good it does. Thou hast not left
3065,A FOREST HYMN.,"Thyself without a witness, in these shades,"
3066,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of thy perfections. Grandeur, strength, and grace"
3067,A FOREST HYMN.,Are here to speak of thee. This mighty oak--
3068,A FOREST HYMN.,By whose immovable stem I stand and seem
3069,A FOREST HYMN.,"Almost annihilated--not a prince,"
3070,A FOREST HYMN.,"In all that proud old world beyond the deep,"
3071,A FOREST HYMN.,Ere wore his crown as loftily as he
3072,A FOREST HYMN.,Wears the green coronal of leaves with which
3073,A FOREST HYMN.,Thy hand has graced him. Nestled at his root
3074,A FOREST HYMN.,"Is beauty, such as blooms not in the glare"
3075,A FOREST HYMN.,Of the broad sun. That delicate forest flower
3076,A FOREST HYMN.,"With scented breath, and look so like a smile,"
3077,A FOREST HYMN.,"Seems, as it issues from the shapeless mould,"
3078,A FOREST HYMN.,"An emanation of the indwelling Life,"
3079,A FOREST HYMN.,"A visible token of the upholding Love,"
3080,A FOREST HYMN.,That are the soul of this wide universe.
3081,A FOREST HYMN.,
3082,A FOREST HYMN.,My heart is awed within me when I think
3083,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of the great miracle that still goes on,"
3084,A FOREST HYMN.,"In silence, round me--the perpetual work"
3085,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of thy creation, finished, yet renewed"
3086,A FOREST HYMN.,For ever. Written on thy works I read
3087,A FOREST HYMN.,The lesson of thy own eternity.
3088,A FOREST HYMN.,"Lo! all grow old and die--but see again,"
3089,A FOREST HYMN.,How on the faltering footsteps of decay
3090,A FOREST HYMN.,Youth presses--ever gay and beautiful youth
3091,A FOREST HYMN.,In all its beautiful forms. These lofty trees
3092,A FOREST HYMN.,Wave not less proudly that their ancestors
3093,A FOREST HYMN.,"Moulder beneath them. Oh, there is not lost"
3094,A FOREST HYMN.,"One of earth's charms: upon her bosom yet,"
3095,A FOREST HYMN.,"After the flight of untold centuries,"
3096,A FOREST HYMN.,The freshness of her far beginning lies
3097,A FOREST HYMN.,And yet shall lie. Life mocks the idle hate
3098,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of his arch enemy Death--yea, seats himself"
3099,A FOREST HYMN.,"Upon the tyrant's throne--the sepulchre,"
3100,A FOREST HYMN.,And of the triumphs of his ghastly foe
3101,A FOREST HYMN.,Makes his own nourishment. For he came forth
3102,A FOREST HYMN.,"From thine own bosom, and shall have no end."
3103,A FOREST HYMN.,
3104,A FOREST HYMN.,There have been holy men who hid themselves
3105,A FOREST HYMN.,"Deep in the woody wilderness, and gave"
3106,A FOREST HYMN.,"Their lives to thought and prayer, till they outlived"
3107,A FOREST HYMN.,"The generation born with them, nor seemed"
3108,A FOREST HYMN.,Less aged than the hoary trees and rocks
3109,A FOREST HYMN.,Around them;--and there have been holy men
3110,A FOREST HYMN.,Who deemed it were not well to pass life thus.
3111,A FOREST HYMN.,But let me often to these solitudes
3112,A FOREST HYMN.,"Retire, and in thy presence reassure"
3113,A FOREST HYMN.,"My feeble virtue. Here its enemies,"
3114,A FOREST HYMN.,"The passions, at thy plainer footsteps shrink"
3115,A FOREST HYMN.,"And tremble and are still. Oh, God! when thou"
3116,A FOREST HYMN.,"Dost scare the world with tempests, set on fire"
3117,A FOREST HYMN.,"The heavens with falling thunderbolts, or fill,"
3118,A FOREST HYMN.,"With all the waters of the firmament,"
3119,A FOREST HYMN.,The swift dark whirlwind that uproots the woods
3120,A FOREST HYMN.,"And drowns the villages; when, at thy call,"
3121,A FOREST HYMN.,Uprises the great deep and throws himself
3122,A FOREST HYMN.,"Upon the continent, and overwhelms"
3123,A FOREST HYMN.,"Its cities--who forgets not, at the sight"
3124,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of these tremendous tokens of thy power,"
3125,A FOREST HYMN.,"His pride, and lays his strifes and follies by?"
3126,A FOREST HYMN.,"Oh, from these sterner aspects of thy face"
3127,A FOREST HYMN.,"Spare me and mine, nor let us need the wrath"
3128,A FOREST HYMN.,Of the mad unchained elements to teach
3129,A FOREST HYMN.,Who rules them. Be it ours to meditate

5175,THE PRAIRIES.°,The platforms where they worshipped unknown gods--

5200,THE PRAIRIES.°,"And, nearer to the Rocky Mountains, sought"
5201,THE PRAIRIES.°,A wilder hunting-ground. The beaver builds

5203,THE PRAIRIES.°,On waters whose blue surface ne'er gave back
5204,THE PRAIRIES.°,"The white man's face--among Missouri's springs,"
5205,THE PRAIRIES.°,"And pools whose issues swell the Oregan,"
5206,THE PRAIRIES.°,He rears his little Venice. In these plains
5207,THE PRAIRIES.°,The bison feeds no more. Twice twenty leagues
5208,THE PRAIRIES.°,"Beyond remotest smoke of hunter's camp,"
5209,THE PRAIRIES.°,"Roams the majestic brute, in herds that shake"

5213,THE PRAIRIES.°,Still this great solitude is quick with life.
5214,THE PRAIRIES.°,"Myriads of insects, gaudy as the flowers"

5218,THE PRAIRIES.°,Startlingly beautiful. The graceful deer
5219,THE PRAIRIES.°,"Bounds to the wood at my approach. The bee,"
5220,THE PRAIRIES.°,"A more adventurous colonist than man,"
5221,THE PRAIRIES.°,"With whom he came across the eastern deep,"
5222,THE PRAIRIES.°,"Fills the savannas with his murmurings,"

5227,THE PRAIRIES.°,Which soon shall fill these deserts. From the ground

6180,TO THE APENNINES.,"Your peaks are beautiful, ye Apennines!"
6181,TO THE APENNINES.,In the soft light of these serenest skies;
6182,TO THE APENNINES.,"From the broad highland region, black with pines,"
6183,TO THE APENNINES.,"Fair as the hills of Paradise they rise,"
6184,TO THE APENNINES.,Bathed in the tint Peruvian slaves behold
6185,TO THE APENNINES.,In rosy flushes on the virgin gold.
6186,TO THE APENNINES.,
6187,TO THE APENNINES.,"There, rooted to the aërial shelves that wear"
6188,TO THE APENNINES.,"The glory of a brighter world, might spring"
6189,TO THE APENNINES.,"Sweet flowers of heaven to scent the unbreathed air,"
6190,TO THE APENNINES.,"And heaven's fleet messengers might rest the wing,"

6192,TO THE APENNINES.,"Silent, and cradled by the glimmering deep."
6193,TO THE APENNINES.,

6196,TO THE APENNINES.,The herd's white bones lie mixed with human mould--
6197,TO THE APENNINES.,Yet up the radiant steeps that I survey
6198,TO THE APENNINES.,"Death never climbed, nor life's soft breath, with pain,"
6199,TO THE APENNINES.,Was yielded to the elements again.
6200,TO THE APENNINES.,
6201,TO THE APENNINES.,Ages of war have filled these plains with fear;
6202,TO THE APENNINES.,How oft the hind has started at the clash
6203,TO THE APENNINES.,"Of spears, and yell of meeting, armies here,"
6204,TO THE APENNINES.,Or seen the lightning of the battle flash
6205,TO THE APENNINES.,"From clouds, that rising with the thunder's sound,"
6206,TO THE APENNINES.,Hung like an earth-born tempest o'er the ground!
6207,TO THE APENNINES.,
6208,TO THE APENNINES.,"Ah me! what armed nations--Asian horde,"
6209,TO THE APENNINES.,"And Libyan host--the Scythian and the Gaul,"
6210,TO THE APENNINES.,"Have swept your base and through your passes poured,"
6211,TO THE APENNINES.,Like ocean-tides uprising at the call
6212,TO THE APENNINES.,Of tyrant winds--against your rocky side
6213,TO THE APENNINES.,"The bloody billows dashed, and howled, and died."
6214,TO THE APENNINES.,
6215,TO THE APENNINES.,"How crashed the towers before beleaguering foes,"
6216,TO THE APENNINES.,Sacked cities smoked and realms were rent in twain;
6217,TO THE APENNINES.,"And commonwealths against their rivals rose,"
6218,TO THE APENNINES.,Trode out their lives and earned the curse of Cain!
6219,TO THE APENNINES.,While in the noiseless air and light that flowed
6220,TO THE APENNINES.,"Round your far brows, eternal Peace abode."
6221,TO THE APENNINES.,
6222,TO THE APENNINES.,"Here pealed the impious hymn, and altar flames"

6224,TO THE APENNINES.,"Jove, Bacchus, Pan, and earlier, fouler names;"
6225,TO THE APENNINES.,"While, as the unheeding ages passed along,"
6226,TO THE APENNINES.,"Ye, from your station in the middle skies,"
6227,TO THE APENNINES.,"Proclaimed the essential Goodness, strong and wise."
6228,TO THE APENNINES.,
6229,TO THE APENNINES.,In you the heart that sighs for freedom seeks
6230,TO THE APENNINES.,"Her image; there the winds no barrier know,"
6231,TO THE APENNINES.,Clouds come and rest and leave your fairy peaks;

6242,EARTH.,A midnight black with clouds is in the sky;
6243,EARTH.,"I seem to feel, upon my limbs, the weight"
6244,EARTH.,Of its vast brooding shadow. All in vain
6245,EARTH.,Turns the tired eye in search of form; no star
6246,EARTH.,"Pierces the pitchy veil; no ruddy blaze,"
6247,EARTH.,"From dwellings lighted by the cheerful hearth,"
6248,EARTH.,Tinges the flowering summits of the grass.
6249,EARTH.,"No sound of life is heard, no village hum,"
6250,EARTH.,"Nor measured tramp of footstep in the path,"
6251,EARTH.,"Nor rush of wing, while, on the breast of Earth,"
6252,EARTH.,I lie and listen to her mighty voice:
6253,EARTH.,A voice of many tones--sent up from streams
6254,EARTH.,"That wander through the gloom, from woods unseen,"
6255,EARTH.,"Swayed by the sweeping of the tides of air,"
6256,EARTH.,"From rocky chasms where darkness dwells all day,"
6257,EARTH.,"And hollows of the great invisible hills,"
6258,EARTH.,"And sands that edge the ocean, stretching far"
6259,EARTH.,Into the night--a melancholy sound!
6260,EARTH.,
6261,EARTH.,O Earth! dost thou too sorrow for the past
6262,EARTH.,Like man thy offspring? Do I hear thee mourn
6263,EARTH.,"Thy childhood's unreturning hours, thy springs"
6264,EARTH.,"Gone with their genial airs and melodies,"
6265,EARTH.,"The gentle generations of thy flowers,"
6266,EARTH.,"And thy majestic groves of olden time,"
6267,EARTH.,Perished with all their dwellers? Dost thou wail
6268,EARTH.,"For that fair age of which the poets tell,"
6269,EARTH.,"Ere the rude winds grew keen with frost, or fire"
6270,EARTH.,"Fell with the rains, or spouted from the hills,"
6271,EARTH.,"To blast thy greenness, while the virgin night"
6272,EARTH.,Was guiltless and salubrious as the day?
6273,EARTH.,Or haply dost thou grieve for those that die--
6274,EARTH.,"For living things that trod thy paths awhile,"
6275,EARTH.,The love of thee and heaven--and now they sleep
6276,EARTH.,Mixed with the shapeless dust on which thy herds
6277,EARTH.,"Trample and graze? I too must grieve with thee,"
6278,EARTH.,O'er loved ones lost. Their graves are far away
6279,EARTH.,"Upon thy mountains; yet, while I recline"
6280,EARTH.,"Alone, in darkness, on thy naked soil,"
6281,EARTH.,The mighty nourisher and burial-place
6282,EARTH.,"Of man, I feel that I embrace their dust."
6283,EARTH.,
6284,EARTH.,Ha! how the murmur deepens! I perceive
6285,EARTH.,And tremble at its dreadful import. Earth
6286,EARTH.,"Uplifts a general cry for guilt and wrong,"
6287,EARTH.,And heaven is listening. The forgotten graves
6288,EARTH.,Of the heart-broken utter forth their plaint.
6289,EARTH.,"The dust of her who loved and was betrayed,"
6290,EARTH.,And him who died neglected in his age;
6291,EARTH.,The sepulchres of those who for mankind
6292,EARTH.,"Laboured, and earned the recompense of scorn;"
6293,EARTH.,"Ashes of martyrs for the truth, and bones"
6294,EARTH.,"Of those who, in the strife for liberty,"
6295,EARTH.,"Were beaten down, their corses given to dogs,"
6296,EARTH.,"Their names to infamy, all find a voice."
6297,EARTH.,"The nook in which the captive, overtoiled,"
6298,EARTH.,"Lay down to rest at last, and that which holds"
6299,EARTH.,"Childhood's sweet blossoms, crushed by cruel hands,"
6300,EARTH.,"Send up a plaintive sound. From battle-fields,"
6301,EARTH.,Where heroes madly drave and dashed their hosts
6302,EARTH.,"Against each other, rises up a noise,"
6303,EARTH.,As if the armed multitudes of dead
6304,EARTH.,Stirred in their heavy slumber. Mournful tones
6305,EARTH.,Come from the green abysses of the sea--
6306,EARTH.,story of the crimes the guilty sought
6307,EARTH.,"To hide beneath its waves. The glens, the groves,"
6308,EARTH.,"Paths in the thicket, pools of running brook,"
6309,EARTH.,"And banks and depths of lake, and streets and lanes"
6310,EARTH.,"Of cities, now that living sounds are hushed,"
6311,EARTH.,Murmur of guilty force and treachery.
6312,EARTH.,
6313,EARTH.,"Here, where I rest, the vales of Italy"

6315,EARTH.,And field of the tremendous warfare waged
6316,EARTH.,"'Twixt good and evil. Who, alas, shall dare"
6317,EARTH.,Interpret to man's ear the mingled voice
6318,EARTH.,That comes from her old dungeons yawning now
6319,EARTH.,"To the black air, her amphitheatres,"
6320,EARTH.,"Where the dew gathers on the mouldering stones,"
6321,EARTH.,"And fanes of banished gods, and open tombs,"
6322,EARTH.,"And roofless palaces, and streets and hearths"
6323,EARTH.,Of cities dug from their volcanic graves?
6324,EARTH.,"I hear a sound of many languages,"
6325,EARTH.,"The utterance of nations now no more,"
6326,EARTH.,"Driven out by mightier, as the days of heaven"
6327,EARTH.,Chase one another from the sky. The blood
6328,EARTH.,"Of freemen shed by freemen, till strange lords"
6329,EARTH.,"Came in the hour of weakness, and made fast"
6330,EARTH.,"The yoke that yet is worn, cries out to Heaven."
6331,EARTH.,
6332,EARTH.,"What then shall cleanse thy bosom, gentle Earth"
6333,EARTH.,From all its painful memories of guilt?
6334,EARTH.,"The whelming flood, or the renewing fire,"
6335,EARTH.,"Or the slow change of time? that so, at last,"
6336,EARTH.,"The horrid tale of perjury and strife,"
6337,EARTH.,"Murder and spoil, which men call history,"
6338,EARTH.,"May seem a fable, like the inventions told"
6339,EARTH.,"By poets of the gods of Greece. O thou,"
6340,EARTH.,"Who sittest far beyond the Atlantic deep,"
6341,EARTH.,"Among the sources of thy glorious streams,"
6342,EARTH.,My native Land of Groves! a newer page
6343,EARTH.,In the great record of the world is thine;

6354,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"This is the church which Pisa, great and free,"

6356,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"That earthquakes shook not from their poise, appear"
6357,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,To shiver in the deep and voluble tones
6358,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,Rolled from the organ! Underneath my feet
6359,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,There lies the lid of a sepulchral vault.
6360,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,The image of an armed knight is graven
6361,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"Upon it, clad in perfect panoply--"

6379,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"And bountiful, and cruel, and devout,"
6380,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,And quick to draw the sword in private feud.
6381,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"He pushed his quarrels to the death, yet prayed"
6382,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,The saints as fervently on bended knees
6383,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,As ever shaven cenobite. He loved
6384,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,As fiercely as he fought. He would have borne
6385,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"The maid that pleased him from her bower by night,"
6386,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"To his hill-castle, as the eagle bears"
6387,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"His victim from the fold, and rolled the rocks"

6389,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,His native Pisa queen and arbitress
6390,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,Of cities: earnestly for her he raised
6391,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"His voice in council, and affronted death"
6392,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"In battle-field, and climbed the galley's deck,"
6393,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"And brought the captured flag of Genoa back,"
6394,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,Or piled upon the Arno's crowded quay
6395,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,The glittering spoils of the tamed Saracen.
6396,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,"He was not born to brook the stranger's yoke,"
6397,THE KNIGHT'S EPITAPH.,But would have joined the exiles that withdrew
