58,THE CROSS.,
59,THE CROSS.,"Richard Dillingham, a young member of the Society of Friends, died"
60,THE CROSS.,"in the Nashville penitentiary, where he was confined for the act of"
61,THE CROSS.,aiding the escape of fugitive slaves.
62,THE CROSS.,
63,THE CROSS.,"""The cross, if rightly borne, shall be"
64,THE CROSS.,"No burden, but support to thee;"""
65,THE CROSS.,"So, moved of old time for our sake,"
66,THE CROSS.,The holy monk of Kempen spake.
67,THE CROSS.,
68,THE CROSS.,Thou brave and true one! upon whom
69,THE CROSS.,"Was laid the cross of martyrdom,"
70,THE CROSS.,"How didst thou, in thy generous youth,"
71,THE CROSS.,Bear witness to this blessed truth!
72,THE CROSS.,
73,THE CROSS.,Thy cross of suffering and of shame
74,THE CROSS.,"A staff within thy hands became,"
75,THE CROSS.,In paths where faith alone could see
76,THE CROSS.,The Master's steps supporting thee.
77,THE CROSS.,
78,THE CROSS.,Thine was the seed-time; God alone
79,THE CROSS.,Beholds the end of what is sown;
80,THE CROSS.,"Beyond our vision, weak and dim,"
81,THE CROSS.,The harvest-time is hid with Him.
82,THE CROSS.,
83,THE CROSS.,"Yet, unforgotten where it lies,"
84,THE CROSS.,"That seed of generous sacrifice,"
85,THE CROSS.,"Though seeming on the desert cast,"
86,THE CROSS.,Shall rise with bloom and fruit at last.

91,THE HERO.,THE HERO.
92,THE HERO.,
93,THE HERO.,The hero of the incident related in this poem was Dr. Samuel Gridley
94,THE HERO.,"Howe, the well-known philanthropist, who when a young man volunteered"
95,THE HERO.,his aid in the Greek struggle for independence.
96,THE HERO.,
97,THE HERO.,"""Oh for a knight like Bayard,"
98,THE HERO.,Without reproach or fear;
99,THE HERO.,"My light glove on his casque of steel,"
100,THE HERO.,My love-knot on his spear!
101,THE HERO.,
102,THE HERO.,"""Oh for the white plume floating"
103,THE HERO.,"Sad Zutphen's field above,--"
104,THE HERO.,"The lion heart in battle,"
105,THE HERO.,The woman's heart in love!
106,THE HERO.,
107,THE HERO.,"""Oh that man once more were manly,"
108,THE HERO.,"Woman's pride, and not her scorn:"
109,THE HERO.,That once more the pale young mother
110,THE HERO.,Dared to boast `a man is born'!
111,THE HERO.,
112,THE HERO.,"""But, now life's slumberous current"
113,THE HERO.,No sun-bowed cascade wakes;
114,THE HERO.,"No tall, heroic manhood"
115,THE HERO.,The level dulness breaks.
116,THE HERO.,
117,THE HERO.,"""Oh for a knight like Bayard,"
118,THE HERO.,Without reproach or fear!
119,THE HERO.,"My light glove on his casque of steel,"
120,THE HERO.,"My love-knot on his spear!"""
121,THE HERO.,
122,THE HERO.,"Then I said, my own heart throbbing"
123,THE HERO.,"To the time her proud pulse beat,"
124,THE HERO.,"""Life hath its regal natures yet,"
125,THE HERO.,"True, tender, brave, and sweet!"
126,THE HERO.,
127,THE HERO.,"""Smile not, fair unbeliever!"
128,THE HERO.,"One man, at least, I know,"
129,THE HERO.,Who might wear the crest of Bayard
130,THE HERO.,Or Sidney's plume of snow.
131,THE HERO.,
132,THE HERO.,"""Once, when over purple mountains"
133,THE HERO.,"Died away the Grecian sun,"
134,THE HERO.,And the far Cyllenian ranges
135,THE HERO.,"Paled and darkened, one by one,--"
136,THE HERO.,
137,THE HERO.,"""Fell the Turk, a bolt of thunder,"
138,THE HERO.,"Cleaving all the quiet sky,"
139,THE HERO.,And against his sharp steel lightnings
140,THE HERO.,Stood the Suliote but to die.
141,THE HERO.,
142,THE HERO.,"""Woe for the weak and halting!"
143,THE HERO.,The crescent blazed behind
144,THE HERO.,"A curving line of sabres,"
145,THE HERO.,Like fire before the wind!
146,THE HERO.,
147,THE HERO.,"""Last to fly, and first to rally,"
148,THE HERO.,"Rode he of whom I speak,"
149,THE HERO.,"When, groaning in his bridle-path,"
150,THE HERO.,Sank down a wounded Greek.
151,THE HERO.,
152,THE HERO.,"""With the rich Albanian costume"
153,THE HERO.,"Wet with many a ghastly stain,"
154,THE HERO.,Gazing on earth and sky as one
155,THE HERO.,Who might not gaze again.
156,THE HERO.,
157,THE HERO.,"""He looked forward to the mountains,"
158,THE HERO.,"Back on foes that never spare,"
159,THE HERO.,"Then flung him from his saddle,"
160,THE HERO.,And placed the stranger there.
161,THE HERO.,
162,THE HERO.,"""'Allah! hu!' Through flashing sabres,"
163,THE HERO.,"Through a stormy hail of lead,"
164,THE HERO.,The good Thessalian charger
165,THE HERO.,Up the slopes of olives sped.
166,THE HERO.,
167,THE HERO.,"""Hot spurred the turbaned riders;"
168,THE HERO.,"He almost felt their breath,"
169,THE HERO.,Where a mountain stream rolled darkly down
170,THE HERO.,Between the hills and death.
171,THE HERO.,
172,THE HERO.,"""One brave and manful struggle,--"
173,THE HERO.,"He gained the solid land,"
174,THE HERO.,"And the cover of the mountains,"
175,THE HERO.,"And the carbines of his band!"""
176,THE HERO.,
177,THE HERO.,"""It was very great and noble,"""
178,THE HERO.,"Said the moist-eyed listener then,"
179,THE HERO.,"""But one brave deed makes no hero;"
180,THE HERO.,"Tell me what he since hath been!"""
181,THE HERO.,
182,THE HERO.,"""Still a brave and generous manhood,"
183,THE HERO.,"Still an honor without stain,"
184,THE HERO.,"In the prison of the Kaiser,"
185,THE HERO.,By the barricades of Seine.
186,THE HERO.,
187,THE HERO.,"""But dream not helm and harness"
188,THE HERO.,The sign of valor true;
189,THE HERO.,Peace hath higher tests of manhood
190,THE HERO.,Than battle ever knew.
191,THE HERO.,
192,THE HERO.,"""Wouldst know him now? Behold him,"
193,THE HERO.,"The Cadmus of the blind,"
194,THE HERO.,"Giving the dumb lip language,"
195,THE HERO.,The idiot-clay a mind.
196,THE HERO.,
197,THE HERO.,"""Walking his round of duty"
198,THE HERO.,"Serenely day by day,"
199,THE HERO.,With the strong man's hand of labor
200,THE HERO.,And childhood's heart of play.
201,THE HERO.,
202,THE HERO.,"""True as the knights of story,"
203,THE HERO.,"Sir Lancelot and his peers,"
204,THE HERO.,Brave in his calm endurance
205,THE HERO.,As they in tilt of spears.
206,THE HERO.,
207,THE HERO.,"""As waves in stillest waters,"
208,THE HERO.,"As stars in noonday skies,"
209,THE HERO.,All that wakes to noble action
210,THE HERO.,In his noon of calmness lies.
211,THE HERO.,
212,THE HERO.,"""Wherever outraged Nature"
213,THE HERO.,"Asks word or action brave,"
214,THE HERO.,"Wherever struggles labor,"
215,THE HERO.,"Wherever groans a slave,--"
216,THE HERO.,
217,THE HERO.,"""Wherever rise the peoples,"
218,THE HERO.,"Wherever sinks a throne,"
219,THE HERO.,The throbbing heart of Freedom finds
220,THE HERO.,An answer in his own.
221,THE HERO.,
222,THE HERO.,"""Knight of a better era,"
223,THE HERO.,Without reproach or fear!
224,THE HERO.,Said I not well that Bayards
225,THE HERO.,"And Sidneys still are here?"""

230,RANTOUL.,RANTOUL.
231,RANTOUL.,
232,RANTOUL.,No more fitting inscription could be placed on the tombstone of
233,RANTOUL.,"Robert Rantoul than this: ""He died at his post in Congress, and his"
234,RANTOUL.,last words were a protest in the name of Democracy against the
235,RANTOUL.,"Fugitive-Slave Law."""
236,RANTOUL.,
237,RANTOUL.,"One day, along the electric wire"
238,RANTOUL.,His manly word for Freedom sped;
239,RANTOUL.,We came next morn: that tongue of fire
240,RANTOUL.,"Said only, ""He who spake is dead!"""
241,RANTOUL.,
242,RANTOUL.,"Dead! while his voice was living yet,"
243,RANTOUL.,In echoes round the pillared dome!
244,RANTOUL.,Dead! while his blotted page lay wet
245,RANTOUL.,With themes of state and loves of home!
246,RANTOUL.,
247,RANTOUL.,"Dead! in that crowning grace of time,"
248,RANTOUL.,That triumph of life's zenith hour!
249,RANTOUL.,Dead! while we watched his manhood's prime
250,RANTOUL.,Break from the slow bud into flower!
251,RANTOUL.,
252,RANTOUL.,"Dead! he so great, and strong, and wise,"
253,RANTOUL.,While the mean thousands yet drew breath;
254,RANTOUL.,"How deepened, through that dread surprise,"
255,RANTOUL.,The mystery and the awe of death!
256,RANTOUL.,
257,RANTOUL.,From the high place whereon our votes
258,RANTOUL.,"Had borne him, clear, calm, earnest, fell"
259,RANTOUL.,"His first words, like the prelude notes"
260,RANTOUL.,Of some great anthem yet to swell.
261,RANTOUL.,
262,RANTOUL.,"We seemed to see our flag unfurled,"
263,RANTOUL.,Our champion waiting in his place
264,RANTOUL.,"For the last battle of the world,"
265,RANTOUL.,The Armageddon of the race.
266,RANTOUL.,
267,RANTOUL.,Through him we hoped to speak the word
268,RANTOUL.,Which wins the freedom of a land;
269,RANTOUL.,"And lift, for human right, the sword"
270,RANTOUL.,Which dropped from Hampden's dying hand.
271,RANTOUL.,
272,RANTOUL.,"For he had sat at Sidney's feet,"
273,RANTOUL.,And walked with Pym and Vane apart;
274,RANTOUL.,"And, through the centuries, felt the beat"
275,RANTOUL.,Of Freedom's march in Cromwell's heart.
276,RANTOUL.,
277,RANTOUL.,"He knew the paths the worthies held,"
278,RANTOUL.,Where England's best and wisest trod;
279,RANTOUL.,"And, lingering, drank the springs that welled"
280,RANTOUL.,Beneath the touch of Milton's rod.
281,RANTOUL.,
282,RANTOUL.,"No wild enthusiast of the right,"
283,RANTOUL.,"Self-poised and clear, he showed alway"
284,RANTOUL.,"The coolness of his northern night,"
285,RANTOUL.,The ripe repose of autumn's day.
286,RANTOUL.,
287,RANTOUL.,"His steps were slow, yet forward still"
288,RANTOUL.,He pressed where others paused or failed;
289,RANTOUL.,"The calm star clomb with constant will,"
290,RANTOUL.,The restless meteor flashed and paled.
291,RANTOUL.,
292,RANTOUL.,"Skilled in its subtlest wile, he knew"
293,RANTOUL.,And owned the higher ends of Law;
294,RANTOUL.,Still rose majestic on his view
295,RANTOUL.,The awful Shape the schoolman saw.
296,RANTOUL.,
297,RANTOUL.,Her home the heart of God; her voice
298,RANTOUL.,The choral harmonies whereby
299,RANTOUL.,"The stars, through all their spheres, rejoice,"
300,RANTOUL.,The rhythmic rule of earth and sky.
301,RANTOUL.,
302,RANTOUL.,We saw his great powers misapplied
303,RANTOUL.,"To poor ambitions; yet, through all,"
304,RANTOUL.,"We saw him take the weaker side,"
305,RANTOUL.,"And right the wronged, and free the thrall."
306,RANTOUL.,
307,RANTOUL.,"Now, looking o'er the frozen North,"
308,RANTOUL.,"For one like him in word and act,"
309,RANTOUL.,"To call her old, free spirit forth,"
310,RANTOUL.,"And give her faith the life of fact,--"
311,RANTOUL.,
312,RANTOUL.,"To break her party bonds of shame,"
313,RANTOUL.,And labor with the zeal of him
314,RANTOUL.,To make the Democratic name
315,RANTOUL.,"Of Liberty the synonyme,--"
316,RANTOUL.,
317,RANTOUL.,"We sweep the land from hill to strand,"
318,RANTOUL.,"We seek the strong, the wise, the brave,"
319,RANTOUL.,"And, sad of heart, return to stand"
320,RANTOUL.,In silence by a new-made grave!
321,RANTOUL.,
322,RANTOUL.,"There, where his breezy hills of home"
323,RANTOUL.,"Look out upon his sail-white seas,"
324,RANTOUL.,"The sounds of winds and waters come,"
325,RANTOUL.,And shape themselves to words like these.
326,RANTOUL.,
327,RANTOUL.,"""Why, murmuring, mourn that he, whose power"
328,RANTOUL.,"Was lent to Party over-long,"
329,RANTOUL.,Heard the still whisper at the hour
330,RANTOUL.,He set his foot on Party wrong?
331,RANTOUL.,
332,RANTOUL.,"""The human life that closed so well"
333,RANTOUL.,No lapse of folly now can stain
334,RANTOUL.,The lips whence Freedom's protest fell
335,RANTOUL.,No meaner thought can now profane.
336,RANTOUL.,
337,RANTOUL.,"""Mightier than living voice his grave"
338,RANTOUL.,That lofty protest utters o'er;
339,RANTOUL.,Through roaring wind and smiting wave
340,RANTOUL.,It speaks his hate of wrong once more.
341,RANTOUL.,
342,RANTOUL.,"""Men of the North! your weak regret"
343,RANTOUL.,Is wasted here; arise and pay
344,RANTOUL.,"To freedom and to him your debt,"
345,RANTOUL.,"By following where he led the way!"""

351,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
352,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"William Forster, of Norwich, England, died in East Tennessee, in"
353,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"the 1st month, 1854, while engaged in presenting to the governors"
354,WILLIAM FORSTER.,of the States of this Union the address of his religious society on
355,WILLIAM FORSTER.,the evils of slavery. He was the relative and coadjutor of the
356,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Buxtons, Gurneys, and Frys; and his whole life, extending al-most"
357,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"to threescore and ten years, was a pore and beautiful example of"
358,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Christian benevolence. He had travelled over Europe, and visited"
359,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"most of its sovereigns, to plead against the slave-trade and"
360,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"slavery; and had twice before made visits to this country, under"
361,WILLIAM FORSTER.,impressions of religious duty. He was the father of the Right Hon.
362,WILLIAM FORSTER.,William Edward Forster. He visited my father's house in Haverhill
363,WILLIAM FORSTER.,during his first tour in the United States.
364,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
365,WILLIAM FORSTER.,The years are many since his hand
366,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Was laid upon my head,"
367,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Too weak and young to understand
368,WILLIAM FORSTER.,The serious words he said.
369,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
370,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Yet often now the good man's look
371,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Before me seems to swim,"
372,WILLIAM FORSTER.,As if some inward feeling took
373,WILLIAM FORSTER.,The outward guise of him.
374,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
375,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"As if, in passion's heated war,"
376,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Or near temptation's charm,"
377,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Through him the low-voiced monitor
378,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Forewarned me of the harm.
379,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
380,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Stranger and pilgrim! from that day
381,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Of meeting, first and last,"
382,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Wherever Duty's pathway lay,"
383,WILLIAM FORSTER.,His reverent steps have passed.
384,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
385,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"The poor to feed, the lost to seek,"
386,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"To proffer life to death,"
387,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Hope to the erring,--to the weak"
388,WILLIAM FORSTER.,The strength of his own faith.
389,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
390,WILLIAM FORSTER.,To plead the captive's right; remove
391,WILLIAM FORSTER.,The sting of hate from Law;
392,WILLIAM FORSTER.,And soften in the fire of love
393,WILLIAM FORSTER.,The hardened steel of War.
394,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
395,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"He walked the dark world, in the mild,"
396,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Still guidance of the Light;
397,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"In tearful tenderness a child,"
398,WILLIAM FORSTER.,A strong man in the right.
399,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
400,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"From what great perils, on his way,"
401,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"He found, in prayer, release;"
402,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Through what abysmal shadows lay
403,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"His pathway unto peace,"
404,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
405,WILLIAM FORSTER.,God knoweth : we could only see
406,WILLIAM FORSTER.,The tranquil strength he gained;
407,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"The bondage lost in liberty,"
408,WILLIAM FORSTER.,The fear in love unfeigned.
409,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
410,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"And I,--my youthful fancies grown"
411,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"The habit of the man,"
412,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Whose field of life by angels sown
413,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"The wilding vines o'erran,--"
414,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
415,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Low bowed in silent gratitude,"
416,WILLIAM FORSTER.,My manhood's heart enjoys
417,WILLIAM FORSTER.,That reverence for the pure and good
418,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Which blessed the dreaming boy's.
419,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
420,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Still shines the light of holy lives
421,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Like star-beams over doubt;
422,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Each sainted memory, Christlike, drives"
423,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Some dark possession out.
424,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
425,WILLIAM FORSTER.,O friend! O brother I not in vain
426,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Thy life so calm and true,"
427,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"The silver dropping of the rain,"
428,WILLIAM FORSTER.,The fall of summer dew!
429,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
430,WILLIAM FORSTER.,How many burdened hearts have prayed
431,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Their lives like thine might be
432,WILLIAM FORSTER.,But more shall pray henceforth for aid
433,WILLIAM FORSTER.,To lay them down like thee.
434,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
435,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"With weary hand, yet steadfast will,"
436,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"In old age as in youth,"
437,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Thy Master found thee sowing still
438,WILLIAM FORSTER.,The good seed of His truth.
439,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
440,WILLIAM FORSTER.,As on thy task-field closed the day
441,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"In golden-skied decline,"
442,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"His angel met thee on the way,"
443,WILLIAM FORSTER.,And lent his arm to thine.
444,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
445,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Thy latest care for man,--thy last"
446,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Of earthly thought a prayer,--"
447,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Oh, who thy mantle, backward cast,"
448,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Is worthy now to wear?
449,WILLIAM FORSTER.,
450,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Methinks the mound which marks thy bed
451,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"Might bless our land and save,"
452,WILLIAM FORSTER.,"As rose, of old, to life the dead"
453,WILLIAM FORSTER.,Who touched the prophet's grave

459,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,
460,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,If I have seemed more prompt to censure wrong
461,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,Than praise the right; if seldom to thine ear
462,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,My voice hath mingled with the exultant cheer
463,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,Borne upon all our Northern winds along;
464,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,If I have failed to join the fickle throng
465,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"In wide-eyed wonder, that thou standest strong"
466,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"In victory, surprised in thee to find"
467,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,Brougham's scathing power with Canning's grace combined;
468,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"That he, for whom the ninefold Muses sang,"
469,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"From their twined arms a giant athlete sprang,"
470,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,Barbing the arrows of his native tongue
471,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"With the spent shafts Latona's archer flung,"
472,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"To smite the Python of our land and time,"
473,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"Fell as the monster born of Crissa's slime,"
474,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,Like the blind bard who in Castalian springs
475,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"Tempered the steel that clove the crest of kings,"
476,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,And on the shrine of England's freedom laid
477,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"The gifts of Cumve and of Delphi's' shade,--"
478,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,Small need hast thou of words of praise from me.
479,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"Thou knowest my heart, dear friend, and well canst guess"
480,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"That, even though silent, I have not the less"
481,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,Rejoiced to see thy actual life agree
482,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"With the large future which I shaped for thee,"
483,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"When, years ago, beside the summer sea,"
484,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"White in the moon, we saw the long waves fall"
485,TO CHARLES SUMNER.,"Baffled and broken from the rocky wall,"

1172,BRYANT ON HIS BIRTHDAY,
1173,BRYANT ON HIS BIRTHDAY,"We praise not now the poet's art,"
1174,BRYANT ON HIS BIRTHDAY,The rounded beauty of his song;

1192,BRYANT ON HIS BIRTHDAY,
1193,BRYANT ON HIS BIRTHDAY,Thank God! his hand on Nature's keys

1486,THE SINGER.,This poem was written on the death of Alice Cary. Her sister

1496,THE SINGER.,"How fresh of life the younger one,"
1497,THE SINGER.,"Half smiles, half tears, like rain in sun!"
1498,THE SINGER.,Her gravest mood could scarce displace
1499,THE SINGER.,The dimples of her nut-brown face.
1500,THE SINGER.,
1501,THE SINGER.,Wit sparkled on her lips not less
1502,THE SINGER.,For quick and tremulous tenderness;
1503,THE SINGER.,"And, following close her merriest glance,"
1504,THE SINGER.,Dreamed through her eyes the heart's romance.
1505,THE SINGER.,
1506,THE SINGER.,"Timid and still, the elder had"
1507,THE SINGER.,Even then a smile too sweetly sad;
1508,THE SINGER.,The crown of pain that all must wear
1509,THE SINGER.,Too early pressed her midnight hair.
1510,THE SINGER.,
1511,THE SINGER.,"Yet ere the summer eve grew long,"
1512,THE SINGER.,Her modest lips were sweet with song;
1513,THE SINGER.,A memory haunted all her words
1514,THE SINGER.,Of clover-fields and singing birds.
1515,THE SINGER.,
1516,THE SINGER.,"Her dark, dilating eyes expressed"
1517,THE SINGER.,The broad horizons of the west;
1518,THE SINGER.,Her speech dropped prairie flowers; the gold
1519,THE SINGER.,Of harvest wheat about her rolled.
1520,THE SINGER.,
1521,THE SINGER.,Fore-doomed to song she seemed to me
1522,THE SINGER.,I queried not with destiny

1525,THE SINGER.,
1526,THE SINGER.,What could I other than I did?

1528,THE SINGER.,Deny the wind-stirred leaf? Rebuke
1529,THE SINGER.,The music of the forest brook?

1531,THE SINGER.,"She went with morning from my door,"
1532,THE SINGER.,But left me richer than before;
1533,THE SINGER.,"Thenceforth I knew her voice of cheer,"
1534,THE SINGER.,The welcome of her partial ear.
1535,THE SINGER.,
1536,THE SINGER.,Years passed: through all the land her name
1537,THE SINGER.,A pleasant household word became
1538,THE SINGER.,All felt behind the singer stood
1539,THE SINGER.,A sweet and gracious womanhood.
1540,THE SINGER.,
1541,THE SINGER.,"Her life was earnest work, not play;"
1542,THE SINGER.,Her tired feet climbed a weary way;
1543,THE SINGER.,And even through her lightest strain
1544,THE SINGER.,We heard an undertone of pain.
1545,THE SINGER.,
1546,THE SINGER.,"Unseen of her her fair fame grew,"
1547,THE SINGER.,"The good she did she rarely knew,"
1548,THE SINGER.,Unguessed of her in life the love
1549,THE SINGER.,That rained its tears her grave above.
1550,THE SINGER.,
1551,THE SINGER.,"When last I saw her, full of peace,"
1552,THE SINGER.,She waited for her great release;
1553,THE SINGER.,"And that old friend so sage and bland,"
1554,THE SINGER.,"Our later Franklin, held her hand."
1555,THE SINGER.,
1556,THE SINGER.,For all that patriot bosoms stirs
1557,THE SINGER.,"Had moved that woman's heart of hers,"
1558,THE SINGER.,And men who toiled in storm and sun
1559,THE SINGER.,Found her their meet companion.
1560,THE SINGER.,
1561,THE SINGER.,"Our converse, from her suffering bed"
1562,THE SINGER.,To healthful themes of life she led
1563,THE SINGER.,The out-door world of bud and bloom
1564,THE SINGER.,And light and sweetness filled her room.
1565,THE SINGER.,
1566,THE SINGER.,Yet evermore an underthought
1567,THE SINGER.,"Of loss to come within us wrought,"
1568,THE SINGER.,And all the while we felt the strain
1569,THE SINGER.,Of the strong will that conquered pain.
1570,THE SINGER.,
1571,THE SINGER.,God giveth quietness at last!
1572,THE SINGER.,The common way that all have passed
1573,THE SINGER.,"She went, with mortal yearnings fond,"
1574,THE SINGER.,To fuller life and love beyond.
1575,THE SINGER.,
1576,THE SINGER.,"Fold the rapt soul in your embrace,"
1577,THE SINGER.,My dear ones! Give the singer place
1578,THE SINGER.,"To you, to her,--I know not where,--"
1579,THE SINGER.,I lift the silence of a prayer.
1580,THE SINGER.,
1581,THE SINGER.,For only thus our own we find;
1582,THE SINGER.,"The gone before, the left behind,"
1583,THE SINGER.,All mortal voices die between;
1584,THE SINGER.,The unheard reaches the unseen.
1585,THE SINGER.,
1586,THE SINGER.,Again the blackbirds sing; the streams
1587,THE SINGER.,"Wake, laughing, from their winter dreams,"
1588,THE SINGER.,And tremble in the April showers
1589,THE SINGER.,The tassels of the maple flowers.
1590,THE SINGER.,
1591,THE SINGER.,But not for her has spring renewed
1592,THE SINGER.,The sweet surprises of the wood;
1593,THE SINGER.,And bird and flower are lost to her
1594,THE SINGER.,Who was their best interpreter.
1595,THE SINGER.,
1596,THE SINGER.,What to shut eyes has God revealed?
1597,THE SINGER.,What hear the ears that death has sealed?
1598,THE SINGER.,What undreamed beauty passing show
1599,THE SINGER.,Requites the loss of all we know?
1600,THE SINGER.,
1601,THE SINGER.,"O silent land, to which we move,"
1602,THE SINGER.,"Enough if there alone be love,"
1603,THE SINGER.,And mortal need can ne'er outgrow
1604,THE SINGER.,What it is waiting to bestow!
1605,THE SINGER.,
1606,THE SINGER.,O white soul! from that far-off shore
1607,THE SINGER.,Float some sweet song the waters o'er.
1608,THE SINGER.,"Our faith confirm, our fears dispel,"

1828,SUMNER,No sense of humor dropped its oil
1829,SUMNER,On the hard ways his purpose went;
1830,SUMNER,Small play of fancy lightened toil;
1831,SUMNER,He spake alone the thing he meant.
1832,SUMNER,

1840,SUMNER,"And sweeten life, and loved his friends"
1841,SUMNER,With most unworldly tenderness.
1842,SUMNER,
1843,SUMNER,But still his tired eyes rarely learned
1844,SUMNER,The glad relief by Nature brought;
1845,SUMNER,Her mountain ranges never turned
1846,SUMNER,His current of persistent thought.
1847,SUMNER,
1848,SUMNER,The sea rolled chorus to his speech

1868,SUMNER,With calm and beauty symbolize
1869,SUMNER,"The peace which follows long annoy,"
1870,SUMNER,"And lend our earth-bent, mourning eyes,"

1876,SUMNER,No night for children of the day!
1877,SUMNER,
1878,SUMNER,Nor cant nor poor solicitudes
1879,SUMNER,Made weak his life's great argument;
1880,SUMNER,Small leisure his for frames and moods
1881,SUMNER,Who followed Duty where she went.
1882,SUMNER,
1883,SUMNER,"The broad, fair fields of God he saw"
1884,SUMNER,Beyond the bigot's narrow bound;
1885,SUMNER,The truths he moulded into law
1886,SUMNER,In Christ's beatitudes he found.
1887,SUMNER,
1888,SUMNER,"His state-craft was the Golden Rule,"
1889,SUMNER,His right of vote a sacred trust;
1890,SUMNER,"Clear, over threat and ridicule,"
1891,SUMNER,"All heard his challenge: ""Is it just?"""
1892,SUMNER,

2401,WILSON,
2402,WILSON,Read at the Massachusetts Club on the seventieth anniversary the
2403,WILSON,"birthday of Vice-President Wilson, February 16, 1882."
2404,WILSON,
2405,WILSON,"The lowliest born of all the land,"
2406,WILSON,He wrung from Fate's reluctant hand
2407,WILSON,The gifts which happier boyhood claims;
2408,WILSON,"And, tasting on a thankless soil"
2409,WILSON,"The bitter bread of unpaid toil,"
2410,WILSON,He fed his soul with noble aims.
2411,WILSON,
2412,WILSON,"And Nature, kindly provident,"
2413,WILSON,To him the future's promise lent;
2414,WILSON,"The powers that shape man's destinies,"
2415,WILSON,"Patience and faith and toil, he knew,"
2416,WILSON,"The close horizon round him grew,"
2417,WILSON,Broad with great possibilities.
2418,WILSON,
2419,WILSON,By the low hearth-fire's fitful blaze
2420,WILSON,"He read of old heroic days,"
2421,WILSON,"The sage's thought, the patriot's speech;"
2422,WILSON,"Unhelped, alone, himself he taught,"
2423,WILSON,"His school the craft at which he wrought,"
2424,WILSON,"His lore the book within his, reach."
2425,WILSON,
2426,WILSON,He felt his country's need; he knew
2427,WILSON,The work her children had to do;
2428,WILSON,"And when, at last, he heard the call"
2429,WILSON,"In her behalf to serve and dare,"
2430,WILSON,Beside his senatorial chair
2431,WILSON,He stood the unquestioned peer of all.
2432,WILSON,
2433,WILSON,Beyond the accident of birth
2434,WILSON,He proved his simple manhood's worth;
2435,WILSON,Ancestral pride and classic grace
2436,WILSON,"Confessed the large-brained artisan,"
2437,WILSON,"So clear of sight, so wise in plan"
2438,WILSON,"And counsel, equal to his place."
2439,WILSON,
2440,WILSON,With glance intuitive he saw
2441,WILSON,"Through all disguise of form and law,"
2442,WILSON,And read men like an open book;
2443,WILSON,"Fearless and firm, he never quailed"
2444,WILSON,"Nor turned aside for threats, nor failed"
2445,WILSON,To do the thing he undertook.
2446,WILSON,
2447,WILSON,"How wise, how brave, he was, how well"
2448,WILSON,"He bore himself, let history tell"
2449,WILSON,"While waves our flag o'er land and sea,"
2450,WILSON,No black thread in its warp or weft;
2451,WILSON,"He found dissevered States, he left"
2452,WILSON,"A grateful Nation, strong and free!"
