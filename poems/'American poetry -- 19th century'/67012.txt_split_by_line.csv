1206,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.",Out of the copse he sprang;
1207,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.",This is the floating briar where he tossed:
1208,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.",The leaves are yet atremble where he sang.
1209,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.",Here a long vista opens--look!
1210,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.","This is the way he took,"
1211,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.",Through the pale poplars by the pond:
1212,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.",Hark! he is shouting in the field beyond.
1213,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.","Ho, there he goes"
1214,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.",Through the alder close!
1215,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.","He leaves me here behind him in his flight,"

1245,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.",A light wind stirs
1246,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.","The filmy tops of delicate dim firs,"
1247,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.","And on the river border blows,"
1248,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.",Breaking the shy bud softly to a rose.
1249,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.","Sing out, O throstle, sing:"

2109,"OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.","This in my soul. Then suddenly a shape,"
