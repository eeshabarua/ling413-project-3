725,PREFACE,"1870_), “and they contented themselves with reëchoings of the old"
726,PREFACE,"music.” ... Within a single period of six years, from 1867 to 1872,"
727,PREFACE,"there appeared Longfellow’s _Divina Commedia_, C. E. Norton’s _Vita"
728,PREFACE,"Nuova_, T. W. Parson’s _Inferno_, William Cullen Bryant’s _Iliad_ and"
729,PREFACE,"_Odyssey_, and Bayard Taylor’s _Faust_."
730,PREFACE,
731,PREFACE,Suddenly the break came. America developed a national consciousness; the
732,PREFACE,"West discovered itself, and the East discovered the West. Grudgingly at"
733,PREFACE,"first, the aristocratic leaders made way for a new expression; crude,"
734,PREFACE,"jangling, vigorously democratic. The old order was changing with a"
735,PREFACE,"vengeance. All the preceding writers—poets like Emerson, Thoreau,"
736,PREFACE,"Lowell, Longfellow, Holmes—were not only products of the New England"
737,PREFACE,"colleges, but typically “Boston gentlemen of the early Renaissance.” To"
738,PREFACE,them the new men must have seemed like a regiment recruited from the
739,PREFACE,"ranks of vulgarity. Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Bret Harte, John Hay,"
740,PREFACE,"Joaquin Miller, Joel Chandler Harris, James Whitcomb Riley—these were"
741,PREFACE,"men who had graduated from the farm, the frontier, the mine, the"
742,PREFACE,"pilot-house, the printer’s shop! For a while, the movement seemed of"
743,PREFACE,little consequence; the impact of Whitman and the Westerners was
744,PREFACE,"averted. The poets of the transition, with a deliberate art, ignored the"
745,PREFACE,surge of a spontaneous national expression. They were even successful in
746,PREFACE,holding it back. But it was gathering force.

749,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD
750,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,
751,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"The nineteenth century, up to its last quarter, had been a period of new"
752,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,vistas and revolts: a period of protest and iconoclasm—the era of
753,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"Shelley and Byron, the prophets of “liberty, equality and fraternity.”"
754,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"It left no immediate heirs. In England, its successors by default were"
755,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"the lesser Victorians.[1] In America, the intensity and power of men"
756,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,like Emerson and Whittier gave way to the pale romanticism and polite
757,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"banter of the transition, or, what might even more fittingly be called"
758,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,the “post-mortem” poets. For these interim lyrists were frankly the
759,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"singers of reaction, reminiscently digging among the bones of a"
760,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"long-dead past. They burrowed and borrowed, half archaeologists, half"
761,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,artisans; impelled not so much by the need of creating poetry as the
762,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,desire to write it.
763,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,
764,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,From 1866 to 1880 the United States was in a chaotic and frankly
765,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"materialistic condition; it was full of political scandals, panics,"
766,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"frauds, malfeasance in high places. The moral fiber was flabby; the"
767,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"country was apathetic, corrupt and contented. As in all such periods of"
768,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"national unconcern, the artists turned from life altogether,"
769,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,preoccupying themselves with the by-products of art: with method and
770,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"technique, with elaborate and artificial conceits, with facile ideas"
771,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"rather than fundamental ideals. Bayard Taylor, Thomas Buchanan Read,"
772,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"Richard Henry Stoddard, Paul Hamilton Hayne, Thomas Bailey Aldrich-all"
773,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"of these authors, in an effort to escape a reality they could not"
774,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"express and did not even wish to understand, fled to a more congenial"
775,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,realm of fantasy. They took the easiest routes to a prim and academic
776,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"Arcadia, to a cloying and devitalized Orient or a mildly sensuous and"
777,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"treacle-dripping Greece. In short, they followed wherever Keats, Shelley"
778,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"(in his lesser lyrics) and Tennyson seemed to lead them. However, not"
779,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"being explorers themselves, they ventured no further than their"
780,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"predecessors, but remained politely in the rear; repeating dulcetly what"
781,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,they had learned from their greater guides—pronouncing it with little
782,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,variety but with a vast and sentimental unction. In their desperate
783,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"preöccupation with lures and legends overseas, they were not, except for"
784,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,"the accident of birth, American at all; all of them owed much more to"
785,THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD,old England than to New England.

789,WALT WHITMAN,
790,WALT WHITMAN,"Whitman, who was to influence future generations so profoundly in Europe"
791,WALT WHITMAN,"as well as in America, had already appeared. The third edition of that"
792,WALT WHITMAN,"stupendous volume, _Leaves of Grass_, had been printed in 1860. Almost"
793,WALT WHITMAN,"immediately after, the publisher failed and the book passed out of"
794,WALT WHITMAN,public notice. But private scrutiny was keen. In 1865 a petty official
795,WALT WHITMAN,discovered that Whitman was the author of the “notorious” _Leaves of
796,WALT WHITMAN,"Grass_ and, in spite of his great sacrifices in nursing hundreds of"
797,WALT WHITMAN,"wounded soldiers, in spite of his many past services and his present"
798,WALT WHITMAN,"poverty, the offending poet was dismissed from his small clerkship in"
799,WALT WHITMAN,"the Department of the Interior at Washington, D. C. Other reverses"
800,WALT WHITMAN,"followed rapidly. But Whitman, broken in health and cheated by his"
801,WALT WHITMAN,"exploiters, lived to see not only a seventh edition of his great work"
802,WALT WHITMAN,"published in 1881, but a complete collection printed in his"
803,WALT WHITMAN,seventy-third year (1892) in which the twelve poems of the experimental
804,WALT WHITMAN,first edition had grown to nearly four hundred.
805,WALT WHITMAN,
806,WALT WHITMAN,The influence of Whitman can scarcely be overestimated. It has touched
807,WALT WHITMAN,"every shore of letters, quickened every current of art. And yet, as late"
808,WALT WHITMAN,"as 1900, Barrett Wendell in his _Literary History of America_ could"
809,WALT WHITMAN,"speak of Whitman’s “eccentric insolence of phrase and temper” and,"
810,WALT WHITMAN,perturbed by the poet’s increasing vogue across the Atlantic (Whitman
811,WALT WHITMAN,"had been hailed by men as eminent as Swinburne, Symonds, Rossetti), he"
812,WALT WHITMAN,is led to write such a preposterous sentence as “In temperament and
813,WALT WHITMAN,style he was an exotic member of that sterile brotherhood which eagerly
814,WALT WHITMAN,greeted him abroad.”
815,WALT WHITMAN,
816,WALT WHITMAN,Such a judgment would be impossible today. Whitman has been acclaimed by
817,WALT WHITMAN,"a great and growing public, not only here but in England, Germany, Italy"
818,WALT WHITMAN,"and France. He has been hailed as prophet, as pioneer, as rebel, as the"
819,WALT WHITMAN,"fiery humanist and, most frequently, as liberator. He is, in spite of"
820,WALT WHITMAN,"the rhetorical flourish, the Lincoln of our literature. The whole scheme"
821,WALT WHITMAN,of _Leaves of Grass_ is inclusive rather than exclusive; its form is
822,WALT WHITMAN,"elemental, dynamic, free."
823,WALT WHITMAN,
824,WALT WHITMAN,Nor was it only in the relatively minor matter of form that Whitman
825,WALT WHITMAN,became our great poetic emancipator. He led the way toward a wider
826,WALT WHITMAN,"aspect of democracy; he took his readers out of fusty, lamp-lit"
827,WALT WHITMAN,"libraries into the coarse sunlight and the buoyant air. He was, as"
828,WALT WHITMAN,"Burroughs wrote, preëminently the poet of vista; his work had the power"
829,WALT WHITMAN,"“to open doors and windows, to let down bars rather than to put them up,"
830,WALT WHITMAN,"to dissolve forms, to escape narrow boundaries, to plant the reader on a"
831,WALT WHITMAN,"hill rather than in a corner.” He could do this because, first of all,"
832,WALT WHITMAN,he believed implicitly in life—in its physical as well as its spiritual
833,WALT WHITMAN,"manifestations; he sought to grasp existence as a whole, not rejecting"
834,WALT WHITMAN,"the things that, to other minds, had seemed trivial or tawdry. The"
835,WALT WHITMAN,cosmic and the commonplace were synonymous to him; he declared he was
836,WALT WHITMAN,"part of the most elemental, primitive things and constantly identified"
837,WALT WHITMAN,himself with them.
838,WALT WHITMAN,
839,WALT WHITMAN,"_“What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest is Me.”_"
840,WALT WHITMAN,
841,WALT WHITMAN,And by “me” he meant not only himself but any man; Whitman’s entire
842,WALT WHITMAN,"work, which has so often been misunderstood as the outpourings of"
843,WALT WHITMAN,"egotism, was never so much a celebration of himself as a glorification"
844,WALT WHITMAN,"of the ordinary man, “the divine average.”"
845,WALT WHITMAN,
846,WALT WHITMAN,"It was this breadth, this jubilant acceptance that made Whitman so keen"
847,WALT WHITMAN,a lover of casual and ordinary things; he was the first of our poets to
848,WALT WHITMAN,"reveal “the glory of the commonplace.” He transmuted, by the intensity"
849,WALT WHITMAN,"of his emotion, material which had been hitherto regarded as too"
850,WALT WHITMAN,unpoetic for poetry. His long poem “Song of Myself” is an excellent
851,WALT WHITMAN,"example. Here his “barbaric yawp,” sounded “over the roofs of the"
852,WALT WHITMAN,"world,” is softened, time and again, to express a lyric ecstasy and naïf"
853,WALT WHITMAN,wonder.
854,WALT WHITMAN,
855,WALT WHITMAN,"I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,"
856,WALT WHITMAN,"And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of"
857,WALT WHITMAN,"the wren,"
858,WALT WHITMAN,"And the tree-toad is a chef-d’œuvre of the highest,"
859,WALT WHITMAN,"And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,"
860,WALT WHITMAN,"And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,"
861,WALT WHITMAN,"And the cow, crunching with depressed head, surpasses any statue,"
862,WALT WHITMAN,And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels!
863,WALT WHITMAN,
864,WALT WHITMAN,"It is this large naturalism, this affection for all that is homely and"
865,WALT WHITMAN,"of the soil, that sets Whitman apart from his fellow-craftsmen as our"
866,WALT WHITMAN,"first American poet. This blend of familiarity and grandeur, this racy"
867,WALT WHITMAN,but religious mysticism animates all his work. It swings with tremendous
868,WALT WHITMAN,vigor through “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry”; it sharpens the sturdy rhythms
869,WALT WHITMAN,(and occasional rhymes) of the “Song of the Broad-Axe”; it beats
870,WALT WHITMAN,sonorously through “Drum-Taps”; it whispers immortally through the
871,WALT WHITMAN,“Memories of President Lincoln” (particularly that magnificent threnody
872,WALT WHITMAN,“When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed”); it quickens the “Song of
873,WALT WHITMAN,"the Open Road” with what Tennyson called “the glory of going on,” and"
874,WALT WHITMAN,lifts with a biblical solemnity in his most famous “Out of the Cradle
875,WALT WHITMAN,Endlessly Rocking.”
876,WALT WHITMAN,
877,WALT WHITMAN,Whitman did not scorn the past; no one was quicker than he to see its
878,WALT WHITMAN,wealth and glories. But most of the older flowerings belonged to their
879,WALT WHITMAN,"own era; they were foreign to our country—transplanted, they did not"
880,WALT WHITMAN,seem to flourish on this soil. What was original with many transatlantic
881,WALT WHITMAN,poets was being merely aped by facile and unoriginal bards in these
882,WALT WHITMAN,"states; concerned only with the myths of other and older countries, they"
883,WALT WHITMAN,were blind to the living legends of their own. In his “Song of the
884,WALT WHITMAN,"Exposition” Whitman not only wrote his own _credo_, he uttered the"
885,WALT WHITMAN,manifesto of the new generation—especially in these lines:
886,WALT WHITMAN,
887,WALT WHITMAN,"Come Muse, migrate from Greece and Ionia."
888,WALT WHITMAN,"Cross out, please, those immensely overpaid accounts;"
889,WALT WHITMAN,"That matter of Troy and Achilles’ wrath, and Aeneas’, Odysseus’"
890,WALT WHITMAN,wanderings;
891,WALT WHITMAN,Placard “Removed” and “To Let” on the rocks of your snowy Parnassus ...
892,WALT WHITMAN,"For know that a better, fresher, busier sphere, a wider, untried domain"
893,WALT WHITMAN,"awaits, demands you."

896,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST
897,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,
898,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,By 1870 the public had been surfeited with sugared conceits and
899,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"fine-spun delicacies. For almost twelve years, Whitman had stormed at"
900,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,the affectations and over-refinements of the period but comparatively
901,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,few had listened. Yet an instinctive distaste for the prevailing
902,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"superficialities had been growing, and when the West began to express"
903,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"itself in the raw accents of Mark Twain and Bret Harte, the people"
904,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"turned to them with enthusiasm and no little relief. Mark Twain, a prose"
905,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"Whitman, revealed the romantic Mississippi and the vast mid-West; Bret"
906,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"Harte, beginning a new American fiction in 1868, ushered in the wild"
907,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,humor and wilder poetry of California. It is still a question whether
908,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,Bret Harte or John Hay first discovered the literary importance of Pike
909,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,County narratives. Twain was positive that Hay was the pioneer;
910,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,documentary evidence points to Harte. But it is indisputable that Harte
911,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"developed—and even overdeveloped—the possibilities of his backgrounds,"
912,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"whereas Hay after a few brilliant ballads, reverted to his early poetic"
913,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"ideals and turned to the production of studied, polished and"
914,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,undistinguished verse. Lacking the tremendous gusto of Mark Twain or
915,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"even the native accuracy of Hay, Bret Harte perfected a terse, dramatic"
916,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"idiom. Less exuberant than his compeers, he became more skilful in"
917,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"making his situations “effective”; he popularized dialect, sharpening"
918,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,his outlines and intensifying the power of his prose. Harte’s was an
919,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,influence that found its echo in the Hoosier stories of Edward Eggleston
920,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,and made so vivid an impress on nineteenth century literature.
921,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,
922,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"To the loose swagger of the West, two other men added their diverse"
923,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"contributions. Edward Rowland Sill, cut short just as his work was"
924,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"gaining headway and strength, brought to it a gentle radicalism, a calm"
925,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"and cultured honesty; Joaquin Miller, rushing to the other extreme,"
926,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,theatricalized and exaggerated all he touched. He shouted platitudes at
927,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,the top of his voice; his lines boomed with the pomposity of a brass
928,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"band; floods, fires, hurricanes, extravagantly blazing sunsets,"
929,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"Amazonian women, the thunder of a herd of buffaloes—all were"
930,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"unmercifully piled on. And yet, even in its most blatant _fortissimos_,"
931,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,Miller’s poetry occasionally captured the lavish grandeur of his
932,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"surroundings, the splendor of the Sierras, the surge and spirit of the"
933,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,Western world.
934,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,
935,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"Now that the leadership of letters had passed from the East, all parts"
936,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,of the country began to try their voices. The West continued to hold its
937,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,tuneful supremacy; the tradition of Harte and Hay was followed (softened
938,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,and sentimentalized) by Eugene Field and James Whitcomb Riley. In the
939,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"South, Irwin Russell was pioneering in negro dialect (1875), Sidney"
940,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,"Lanier fashioned his intricate harmonies (1879), and Madison Cawein was"
941,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,beginning to create his tropical and over-luxuriant lyrics. A few years
942,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,later (in 1888) Russell brought out his faithfully-rendered _Dialect
943,THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST,Poems_ and the first phase of the American renascence had passed.

947,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,
948,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,The reaction set in at the beginning of the last decade of the
949,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"nineteenth century. The passionate urge had spent itself, and in its"
950,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,place there remained nothing but that minor form of art which concerns
951,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,itself less with creation than with re-creation. These re-creators wrote
952,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"verse that was precise, scholarly and patently reproductive of their"
953,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"predecessors. “In 1890,” writes Percy H. Boynton, “the poetry-reading"
954,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,world was chiefly conscious of the passing of its leading singers for
955,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,the last half-century. It was a period when they were recalling
956,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"Emerson’s ‘Terminus’ and Longfellow’s ‘Ultima Thule,’ Whittier’s ‘A"
957,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"Lifetime,’ Tennyson’s ‘Crossing the Bar,’ and Browning’s"
958,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,‘Asolando.’” ... The poetry of this period (whether it is the hard
959,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,chiseled verse of John B. Tabb or the ornate delicacy of Richard Watson
960,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Gilder) breathes a kind of moribund resignation; it is dead because it
961,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"detached itself from the actual world, because it attempted to be a"
962,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,copied embellishment rather than an interpretation of life. But those
963,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,who regarded poetry chiefly as a not too energetic indoor-exercise were
964,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,not to rule unchallenged. Restlessness was in the air and revolt openly
965,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"declared itself with the publication of _Songs from Vagabondia_ (1894),"
966,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,_More Songs from Vagabondia_ (1896) and _Last Songs from Vagabondia_
967,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,(1900). No one could have been more surprised at the tremendous
968,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,popularity of these care-free celebrations (the first of the three
969,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"collections went through seven rapid editions) than the young authors,"
970,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Richard Hovey and Bliss Carman. For theirs was a revolt without a
971,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"program, a headlong flight to escape—what? In the very first poem, Hovey"
972,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,voices their manifesto:
973,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,
974,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Off with the fetters
975,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,That chafe and restrain!
976,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Off with the chain!
977,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"Here Art and Letters,"
978,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Music and Wine
979,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"And Myrtle and Wanda,"
980,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"The winsome witches,"
981,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Blithely combine.
982,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"Here is Golconda,"
983,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"Here are the Indies,"
984,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Here we are free—
985,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"Free as the wind is,"
986,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"Free as the sea,"
987,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Free!
988,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,
989,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"Free for what? one asks doggedly. Hovey does not answer directly, but"
990,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"with unflagging buoyancy, whipped up by scorn for the smug ones, he"
991,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,continues:
992,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,
993,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"I tell you that we,"
994,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,While you are smirking
995,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,And lying and shirking
996,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"Life’s duty of duties,"
997,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"Honest sincerity,"
998,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,We are in verity
999,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Free!
1000,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Free to rejoice
1001,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,In blisses and beauties!
1002,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Free as the voice
1003,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Of the wind as it passes!
1004,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,Free ... _etc._
1005,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,
1006,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"Free, one concludes, to dwell with Music and Wine, Myrtle and Wanda, Art"
1007,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"and Letters. Free, in short, to follow, with a more athletic energy, the"
1008,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,same ideals as the parlor-poets they gibed so relentlessly. And the new
1009,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"insurgence triumphed. It was the heartiness, the gypsy jollity, the rush"
1010,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,of high spirits that conquered. Readers of the _Vagabondia_ books were
1011,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,swept along by their speed faster than by their philosophy.
1012,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,
1013,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"The enthusiastic acceptance of these new apostles of outdoor vigor was,"
1014,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"however, not as much of an accident as it seemed. On one side, the world"
1015,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"of art, the public was wearied by barren philosophizing set to tinkling"
1016,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"music; on the other, the world of action, it was faced by a staggering"
1017,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"growth of materialism which it feared. Hovey, Carman and their imitators"
1018,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,offered a swift and stirring way out. But it was neither an effectual
1019,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"nor a permanent escape. The war with Spain, the industrial turmoil, the"
1020,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,growth of social consciousness and new ideas of responsibility made
1021,REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S,"America look for fresh valuations, more searching songs. Hovey began to"

1031,INTERIM—1890–1912,This interval of about twenty years was notable for its effort to treat
1032,INTERIM—1890–1912,"the spirit of the times with a cheerful evasiveness, a humorous"
1033,INTERIM—1890–1912,"unconcern; its most representative craftsmen were, with four exceptions,"
1034,INTERIM—1890–1912,"the writers of light verse. These four exceptions were Richard Hovey,"
1035,INTERIM—1890–1912,"Bliss Carman, William Vaughn Moody and Edwin Markham. Both Hovey (in his"
1036,INTERIM—1890–1912,"_Along the Trail_ and his modernization of _Launcelot_ and _Guenevere_,"
1037,INTERIM—1890–1912,a poetic drama in five books) and Carman (in his later poems like _Songs
1038,INTERIM—1890–1912,of the Sea Children_) saw wider horizons and tuned their instruments to
1039,INTERIM—1890–1912,a larger music.
1040,INTERIM—1890–1912,
1041,INTERIM—1890–1912,"Moody’s power was still greater. In “An Ode in Time of Hesitation,” he"
1042,INTERIM—1890–1912,protested against turning the “new-world victories into gain” and
1043,INTERIM—1890–1912,painted America on a majestic canvas. In “The Quarry” he celebrated
1044,INTERIM—1890–1912,America’s part in preventing the breaking-up of China by the greedy
1045,INTERIM—1890–1912,"empires of Europe (an act accomplished by John Hay, poet and diplomat)."
1046,INTERIM—1890–1912,"In “On a Soldier Fallen in the Philippines,” a dirge wrenched from the"
1047,INTERIM—1890–1912,"depths of his nature, Moody cried out against our own grasping"
1048,INTERIM—1890–1912,imperialists. It was the fulfilment of this earlier poem which found its
1049,INTERIM—1890–1912,"fierce climax in the lengthy Ode, with lines like:"
1050,INTERIM—1890–1912,
1051,INTERIM—1890–1912,Was it for this our fathers kept the law?
1052,INTERIM—1890–1912,This crown shall crown their struggle and their ruth?
1053,INTERIM—1890–1912,Are we the eagle nation Milton saw
1054,INTERIM—1890–1912,Mewing its mighty youth?...
1055,INTERIM—1890–1912,... O ye who lead
1056,INTERIM—1890–1912,Take heed!
1057,INTERIM—1890–1912,"Blindness we may forgive, but baseness we will smite."
1058,INTERIM—1890–1912,
1059,INTERIM—1890–1912,"Early in 1899, the name of Edwin Markham flashed across the land when,"
1060,INTERIM—1890–1912,"out of San Francisco, rose the sonorous challenge of “The Man with the"
1061,INTERIM—1890–1912,"Hoe.” This poem, which has been ecstatically called “the battle-cry of"
1062,INTERIM—1890–1912,the next thousand years” (Joaquin Miller declared it contained “the
1063,INTERIM—1890–1912,"whole Yosemite—the thunder, the might, the majesty”), caught up, with a"
1064,INTERIM—1890–1912,"prophetic vibrancy, the passion for social justice that was waiting to"
1065,INTERIM—1890–1912,be intensified in poetry. Markham summed up and spiritualized the unrest
1066,INTERIM—1890–1912,"that was in the air; in the figure of one man with a hoe, he drew a"
1067,INTERIM—1890–1912,"picture of men in the mines, men in the sweat-shop, men working without"
1068,INTERIM—1890–1912,"joy, without hope. To social consciousness he added social conscience."
1069,INTERIM—1890–1912,"In a ringing blank verse, Markham crystallized the expression of"
1070,INTERIM—1890–1912,"outrage, the heated ferment of the period. His was a vision of a new"
1071,INTERIM—1890–1912,"order, austere in beauty but deriving its life-blood from the millions"
1072,INTERIM—1890–1912,struggling in the depths.
1073,INTERIM—1890–1912,
1074,INTERIM—1890–1912,"Inspiring as these examples were, they did not generate others of their"
1075,INTERIM—1890–1912,kind; the field lay fallow for more than a decade. The lull was
1076,INTERIM—1890–1912,"pronounced, the gathering storm remained inaudible."

1080,RENASCENCE—1913,
1081,RENASCENCE—1913,Suddenly the “new” poetry burst upon us with unexpected vigor and
1082,RENASCENCE—1913,extraordinary variety. Moody and Markham were its immediate forerunners;
1083,RENASCENCE—1913,"Whitman its godfather. October, 1912, saw the first issue of _Poetry: A"
1084,RENASCENCE—1913,"Magazine of Verse_, a monthly that was to introduce the work of hitherto"
1085,RENASCENCE—1913,"unknown poets and to herald, with an eager impartiality, the various"
1086,RENASCENCE—1913,"groups, schools and “movements.” The magazine came at the very moment"
1087,RENASCENCE—1913,before the breaking of the storm. Flashes and rumblings had already been
1088,RENASCENCE—1913,troubling the literary heavens; a few months later—the deluge! For three
1089,RENASCENCE—1913,years the skies continued to discharge such strange and divergent
1090,RENASCENCE—1913,phenomena as Vachel Lindsay’s _General William Booth Enters into Heaven_
1091,RENASCENCE—1913,"(1913), James Oppenheim’s _Songs for the New Age_ (1914), the first"
1092,RENASCENCE—1913,"anthology of _The Imagists_ (1914), _Challenge_ (1914), Amy Lowell’s"
1093,RENASCENCE—1913,"_Sword Blades and Poppy Seed_ (1914), Lindsay’s _The Congo and Other"
1094,RENASCENCE—1913,"Poems_ (1914), Robert Frost’s _North of Boston_ (1914), Edgar Lee"
1095,RENASCENCE—1913,"Master’s _Spoon River Anthology_ (1915), John Gould Fletcher’s"
1096,RENASCENCE—1913,"_Irradiations_ (1915), Carl Sandburg’s _Chicago Poems_ (1916). By 1917,"
1097,RENASCENCE—1913,the “new” poetry was ranked as “America’s first national art”; its
1098,RENASCENCE—1913,"success was sweeping, its sales unprecedented. People who never before"
1099,RENASCENCE—1913,"had read verse, turned to it and found they could not only read but"
1100,RENASCENCE—1913,relish it. They discovered that for the enjoyment of poetry it was not
1101,RENASCENCE—1913,necessary to have at their elbows a dictionary of rare words and
1102,RENASCENCE—1913,classical references; they no longer were required to be acquainted with
1103,RENASCENCE—1913,Latin legendry and the minor love-affairs of the major Greek divinities.
1104,RENASCENCE—1913,"Life was their glossary, not literature. The new product spoke to them"
1105,RENASCENCE—1913,in their own language. And it did more: it spoke to them of what they
1106,RENASCENCE—1913,had scarcely ever heard expressed; it was not only closer to their soil
1107,RENASCENCE—1913,but nearer their souls.

1110,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,ROBINSON AND MASTERS
1111,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,
1112,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,One reason why the new poetry achieved so sudden a success was its
1113,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,freedom from the traditionally stilted “poetic diction.” Revolting
1114,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,strongly against the assumption that poetry must have a vocabulary of
1115,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"its own, the poets of the new era spoke in the oldest and most stirring"
1116,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,tongue; they used a language that was the language not of the poetasters
1117,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,but of the people. In the tones of ordinary speech they rediscovered the
1118,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"strength, the dignity, the divine core of the commonplace."
1119,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,
1120,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"E. A. Robinson had already been employing the sharp epithet, the direct"
1121,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,and clarifying utterance which was to become part of our present
1122,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"technique. As early as 1897, in _The Children of the Night_, Robinson"
1123,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,anticipated the brief characterizations and the etched outlines of
1124,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,Masters’s _Spoon River Anthology_; he stressed the psychological element
1125,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,with unerring artistry and sureness of touch. His sympathetic studies of
1126,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"men whose lives were, from a worldly standpoint, failures were a sharp"
1127,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"reaction to the current high valuation on financial achievements,"
1128,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"ruthless efficiency and success at any cost. Ahead of his period, he had"
1129,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"to wait until 1916, when a public prepared for him by the awakened"
1130,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,interest in native poetry discovered _The Man Against the Sky_ (1916)
1131,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,and the richness of Robinson at the same time.
1132,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,
1133,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"Frost and Masters were the bright particular planets of 1915, although"
1134,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,the star of the latter has waned while the light of the former has grown
1135,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,in magnitude. Yet Masters’s most famous book will rank as one of the
1136,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"landmarks of American literature. In it, he has synthesized the small"
1137,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,towns of the mid-West with a background that is unmistakably local and
1138,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"implications that are universal. This amazing volume, in its curiosity"
1139,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"and comprehensiveness, is a broad cross-section of whole communities."
1140,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"Beneath its surface tales and dramas, its condensation of grocery store"
1141,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"gossip, _Spoon River Anthology_ is a great part of America in microcosm."
1142,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,The success of the volume was sensational. It was actually one of the
1143,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"season’s “best sellers”; in a few months, it went into edition after"
1144,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,edition. People forgot Masters’s revelation of the sordid cheats and
1145,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"hypocrisies, his arraignment of dirty politics and dirtier chicanery, in"
1146,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,their interest at seeing their neighbors so pitilessly exposed. Yet had
1147,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"Masters dwelt only on the drab disillusion of the village, had he (as he"
1148,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,was constantly in danger of doing) overemphasized the morbid and sensual
1149,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"episodes, he would have left only a spectacular and poorly-balanced"
1150,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,work. But the book ascends to buoyant exaltation and ends on a plane of
1151,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"victorious idealism. In its wide gamut, _Spoon River_, rising from its"
1152,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"narrow origins, reaches epical proportions. Indigenous to its roots, it"
1153,ROBINSON AND MASTERS,"is stark, unflinching, unforgettable."

1156,FROST AND SANDBURG,FROST AND SANDBURG
1157,FROST AND SANDBURG,
1158,FROST AND SANDBURG,The same year that brought forth _Spoon River Anthology_ saw the
1159,FROST AND SANDBURG,American edition of Frost’s _North of Boston_. It was evident at once
1160,FROST AND SANDBURG,"that the true poet of New England had arrived. Unlike his predecessors,"
1161,FROST AND SANDBURG,Frost was never a poetic provincial—never parochial in the sense that
1162,FROST AND SANDBURG,America was still a literary parish of England. He is as native as the
1163,FROST AND SANDBURG,"lonely farmhouses, the dusty blueberries, the isolated people, the"
1164,FROST AND SANDBURG,"dried-up brooks and mountain intervals that he describes. Loving, above"
1165,FROST AND SANDBURG,"everything else, the beauty of the Fact, he shares, with Robinson and"
1166,FROST AND SANDBURG,"Masters, the determination to tell not merely the actual but the factual"
1167,FROST AND SANDBURG,"truth. But Frost, a less disillusioned though a more saddened poet,"
1168,FROST AND SANDBURG,wears his rue and his realism with a difference. Where Robinson is
1169,FROST AND SANDBURG,"downright and definite, Frost diverges, going roundabout and, in his"
1170,FROST AND SANDBURG,"speculative wandering, covering a wider territory of thought. Where"
1171,FROST AND SANDBURG,"Masters is violent and hotly scornful, Frost is reticent and quietly"
1172,FROST AND SANDBURG,"sympathetic. Again where Masters, viewing the mêlée above the struggle,"
1173,FROST AND SANDBURG,"writes _about_ his characters, Frost is _of_ the people. Where Robinson,"
1174,FROST AND SANDBURG,"in his more racy and reminiscent moods, often reflects New England,"
1175,FROST AND SANDBURG,Frost _is_ New England.
1176,FROST AND SANDBURG,
1177,FROST AND SANDBURG,_North of Boston_ is well described by the poet’s own subtitle: “a book
1178,FROST AND SANDBURG,of people.” In it one not only sees a countryside of people making the
1179,FROST AND SANDBURG,"intricate pattern of their lives, one catches them thinking out loud,"
1180,FROST AND SANDBURG,one can hear the very tones of their voices. Here we have speech so
1181,FROST AND SANDBURG,arranged and translated that the speaker is heard on the printed page;
1182,FROST AND SANDBURG,any reader will be led by the kind and color of these words into
1183,FROST AND SANDBURG,reproducing the changing accents in which they are supposed to be
1184,FROST AND SANDBURG,uttered. It is this insistence that “all poetry is the reproduction of
1185,FROST AND SANDBURG,"the tones of actual speech” that gives these poems, as well as the later"
1186,FROST AND SANDBURG,"ones, a quickly-communicated emotional appeal. It endows them with the"
1187,FROST AND SANDBURG,deepest power of which words are capable—the power to transmit
1188,FROST AND SANDBURG,"significant sounds. These sounds, let in from the vernacular, are full"
1189,FROST AND SANDBURG,"of a robust, creative energy; they share the blood and bones of the"
1190,FROST AND SANDBURG,people they represent.
1191,FROST AND SANDBURG,
1192,FROST AND SANDBURG,But Frost is by no means the dark naturalist that many suspect. Behind
1193,FROST AND SANDBURG,"the mask of “grimness” which many of his critics have fastened upon him,"
1194,FROST AND SANDBURG,"there is a continual elfin pucker; a whimsical smile, a half-disclosed"
1195,FROST AND SANDBURG,raillery glints beneath his most somber monologues. His most concrete
1196,FROST AND SANDBURG,facts are symbols of spiritual values; through his very reticence one
1197,FROST AND SANDBURG,hears more than the voice of New England.
1198,FROST AND SANDBURG,
1199,FROST AND SANDBURG,"Just so, the great mid-West, that vast region of steel mills and"
1200,FROST AND SANDBURG,"slaughter-houses, of cornfields and prairies, of crowded cities and"
1201,FROST AND SANDBURG,"empty skies, speaks through Carl Sandburg. In Sandburg, industrial"
1202,FROST AND SANDBURG,"America has found its voice: _Chicago Poems_ (1916), _Cornhuskers_"
1203,FROST AND SANDBURG,"(1918), _Smoke and Steel_ (1920) vibrate with the immense purring of"
1204,FROST AND SANDBURG,"dynamos, the swishing rhythms of threshing arms, the gossip and laughter"
1205,FROST AND SANDBURG,"of construction gangs, the gigantic and tireless energy of the modern"
1206,FROST AND SANDBURG,"machine. Frankly indebted to Whitman, Sandburg’s poems are less sweeping"
1207,FROST AND SANDBURG,but more varied; musically his lines mark a great advance. He sounds the
1208,FROST AND SANDBURG,extremes of the gamut: there are few poems in our language more violent
1209,FROST AND SANDBURG,"than “To a Contemporary Bunkshooter,” few lyrics as hushed and tender as"
1210,FROST AND SANDBURG,“Cool Tombs.”
1211,FROST AND SANDBURG,
1212,FROST AND SANDBURG,"Like Frost, Sandburg is true to _things_. But Frost is content with the"
1213,FROST AND SANDBURG,inexhaustible Fact and its spiritual implications; he never hopes to
1214,FROST AND SANDBURG,"drain it all. Sandburg also feeds on the fact, but it does not satisfy"
1215,FROST AND SANDBURG,"him. He has strange hungers; he hunts eagerly for the question behind,"
1216,FROST AND SANDBURG,"the answer beyond. The actual scene, to him, is a point of vivid and"
1217,FROST AND SANDBURG,"abrupt departure. Reality, far from being the earth on which he dwells,"
1218,FROST AND SANDBURG,"is, for Sandburg, the ground he touches before rising; realism acts"
1219,FROST AND SANDBURG,merely as a springboard from which this poet leaps into a romantic
1220,FROST AND SANDBURG,mysticism.
1221,FROST AND SANDBURG,
1222,FROST AND SANDBURG,"When _Chicago Poems_ first appeared, it was received with a disfavor"
1223,FROST AND SANDBURG,ranging from hesitant patronization to the scornful jeers of the
1224,FROST AND SANDBURG,academicians. Sandburg was accused of verbal anarchy; of a failure to
1225,FROST AND SANDBURG,"distinguish prose matter from poetic material; of uncouthness,"
1226,FROST AND SANDBURG,"vulgarity, of assaults on the English language and a score of other"
1227,FROST AND SANDBURG,crimes. In the face of those who still see only a coarseness and
1228,FROST AND SANDBURG,"distorted veritism in Sandburg, it cannot be said too often that he is"
1229,FROST AND SANDBURG,brutal only when dealing with brutal things; that his “vulgarity”
1230,FROST AND SANDBURG,"springs from an immense love of life, not from a merely decorative part"
1231,FROST AND SANDBURG,of it; that his bitterest invectives are the result of a healthy disgust
1232,FROST AND SANDBURG,"of shams; that, behind the force of his projectile-phrases, there burns"
1233,FROST AND SANDBURG,the greater flame of his pity; that the strength of his hatred is
1234,FROST AND SANDBURG,exceeded only by the challenge of his love.

1237,THE IMAGISTS,THE IMAGISTS
1238,THE IMAGISTS,
1239,THE IMAGISTS,Sandburg established himself as the most daring user of American
1240,THE IMAGISTS,words—rude words ranging from the racy metaphors of the soil to the
1241,THE IMAGISTS,"slang of the street. But even before this, the possibilities of a new"
1242,THE IMAGISTS,"vocabulary were being tested. As early as 1865, Whitman was saying, “We"
1243,THE IMAGISTS,"must have new words, new potentialities of speech—an American range of"
1244,THE IMAGISTS,"self-expression ... The new times, the new people need a tongue"
1245,THE IMAGISTS,"according, yes, and what is more, they will have such a tongue—will not"
1246,THE IMAGISTS,be satisfied until it is evolved.”
1247,THE IMAGISTS,
1248,THE IMAGISTS,It is curious to think that one of the most effective agents to fulfil
1249,THE IMAGISTS,Whitman’s prophecy and free modern poetry from its mouldering diction
1250,THE IMAGISTS,"was that little band of preoccupied specialists, the Imagists. They"
1251,THE IMAGISTS,"were, for all their preciosity and occasional extravagances, prophets of"
1252,THE IMAGISTS,"freedom—liberators in the sense that their programs, pronouncements and"
1253,THE IMAGISTS,propaganda compelled even their most dogged adversaries to acknowledge
1254,THE IMAGISTS,the integrity of their aims. Their restatement of old truths was one of
1255,THE IMAGISTS,the things which helped the new poetry out of a bog of rhetorical
1256,THE IMAGISTS,rubbish.
1257,THE IMAGISTS,
1258,THE IMAGISTS,Ezra Pound was the first to gather the insurgents into a definite group.
1259,THE IMAGISTS,"During the winter of 1913, he collected a number of poems illustrating"
1260,THE IMAGISTS,the Imagist point of view and had them printed in a volume: _Des
1261,THE IMAGISTS,Imagistes_ (1914). A little later Pound withdrew from the clan. The
1262,THE IMAGISTS,"rather queerly assorted group began to disintegrate and Amy Lowell, then"
1263,THE IMAGISTS,"in England, brought the best of the younger members together in three"
1264,THE IMAGISTS,"yearly anthologies (_Some Imagist Poets_) which appeared in 1915, 1916"
1265,THE IMAGISTS,"and 1917. There were, in Miss Lowell’s new grouping, three Englishmen"
1266,THE IMAGISTS,"(D. H. Lawrence, Richard Aldington, F. S. Flint), three Americans (“H."
1267,THE IMAGISTS,"D.,” John Gould Fletcher, Amy Lowell), and their creed, summed up in six"
1268,THE IMAGISTS,"articles of faith, was as follows:"
1269,THE IMAGISTS,
1270,THE IMAGISTS,"1. To use the language of common speech, but to employ always the"
1271,THE IMAGISTS,"_exact_ word, not the merely decorative word."
1272,THE IMAGISTS,
1273,THE IMAGISTS,2. To create new rhythms—as the expression of new moods. We do not
1274,THE IMAGISTS,insist upon “free-verse” as the only method of writing poetry ... We
1275,THE IMAGISTS,do believe that the individuality of a poet may often be better
1276,THE IMAGISTS,expressed in free verse than in conventional forms.
1277,THE IMAGISTS,
1278,THE IMAGISTS,3. To allow absolute freedom in the choice of subject.
1279,THE IMAGISTS,
1280,THE IMAGISTS,4. To present an image (hence the name: “Imagist”). We are not a
1281,THE IMAGISTS,"school of painters, but we believe that poetry should render"
1282,THE IMAGISTS,"particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities, however"
1283,THE IMAGISTS,magnificent and sonorous.
1284,THE IMAGISTS,
1285,THE IMAGISTS,"5. To produce poetry that is hard and clear, never blurred or"
1286,THE IMAGISTS,indefinite.
1287,THE IMAGISTS,
1288,THE IMAGISTS,"6. Finally, most of us believe that concentration is the very"
1289,THE IMAGISTS,essence of poetry.
1290,THE IMAGISTS,
1291,THE IMAGISTS,It does not seem possible that these six obvious and almost
1292,THE IMAGISTS,"platitudinous principles, which the Imagists so often neglected in their"
1293,THE IMAGISTS,"poetry, could have evoked the storm of argument, fury and downright"
1294,THE IMAGISTS,vilification that broke as soon as the militant Amy Lowell began to
1295,THE IMAGISTS,"champion them. Far from being revolutionary, these principles were not"
1296,THE IMAGISTS,new; they were not even thought so by their sponsors. The Imagists
1297,THE IMAGISTS,themselves realized they were merely restating ideals which had fallen
1298,THE IMAGISTS,"into desuetude, and declared, “They are the essentials of all great"
1299,THE IMAGISTS,"poetry, indeed of all great literature.” And yet many conservative"
1300,THE IMAGISTS,"critics, joined by the one hundred per cent reactionaries, rushed wildly"
1301,THE IMAGISTS,"to combat these “heresies”! They forgot that, in trying to protect the"
1302,THE IMAGISTS,"future from such lawlessness as “using the exact word,” from allowing"
1303,THE IMAGISTS,"“freedom in the choice of subject,” from the importance of"
1304,THE IMAGISTS,"“concentration,” they were actually attacking the highest traditions of"
1305,THE IMAGISTS,their enshrined past.
1306,THE IMAGISTS,
1307,THE IMAGISTS,The controversy succeeded in doing even more than the work of the
1308,THE IMAGISTS,"Imagists themselves. “H. D.” remained in England, perfecting her"
1309,THE IMAGISTS,"delicate and exquisitely finished designs. John Gould Fletcher, a more"
1310,THE IMAGISTS,"vacillating expatriate, continued to strengthen his gift and shift his"
1311,THE IMAGISTS,standards; his later and richer work is in almost flat opposition to the
1312,THE IMAGISTS,early pronouncements. Miss Lowell was left to carry on the battle

1314,THE IMAGISTS,"beginning to violate brilliantly. By all odds, the most energetic and"
1315,THE IMAGISTS,"unflagging experimenter, Miss Lowell’s versatility became amazing. She"
1316,THE IMAGISTS,"has wielded a controversial cudgel with one hand and, with the other,"
1317,THE IMAGISTS,"she has written Chaucerian stanzas, polyphonic prose, monologs in her"
1318,THE IMAGISTS,"native New England dialect, irregular _vers libre_, conservative"
1319,THE IMAGISTS,"couplets, translations from the French, echoes from the Japanese, even"
1320,THE IMAGISTS,primitive re-creations of Indian folk-lore!
1321,THE IMAGISTS,
1322,THE IMAGISTS,The work of the Imagists was done. Its members began to develop
1323,THE IMAGISTS,themselves by themselves. They had helped to swell the tide of realistic
1324,THE IMAGISTS,and romantic naturalism—a tide of which their contribution was merely
1325,THE IMAGISTS,"one wave, a high breaker that carried its impact far inshore."

1330,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"In a country that has not been mellowed by antiquity, that has not"
1331,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"possessed songs for its peasantry or traditions for its singers, one"
1332,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,cannot look for a wealth of folk-stuff. In such a country—the United
1333,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"States, to be specific—what folk-poetry there is, has followed the path"
1334,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,of the pioneer. At first these homely songs were merely adaptations and
1335,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"localized versions of English ballads and border minstrelsy, of which"
1336,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,the “Lonesome Tunes” discovered in the Kentucky mountains by Howard
1337,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"Brockway and Loraine Wyman are excellent examples. But later, a more"
1338,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,definitely native spirit found expression in the various sections of
1339,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,these states. In the West (during the seventies) Bret Harte and John Hay
1340,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"celebrated, in their own accents, the rough, big-hearted miners,"
1341,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"ranchers, steamboat pilots, the supposed descendants of the emigrants"
1342,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"from Pike County, Missouri. In the Middle West the desire for local"
1343,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,color and music led to the popularity of James Whitcomb Riley’s Hoosier
1344,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,ballads and the spirited jingles of Eugene Field. In the South the
1345,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,inspiration of the negro spirituals and ante-bellum songs was utilized
1346,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"to excellent effect by Irwin Russell, Joel Chandler Harris and, later,"
1347,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"by Paul Laurence Dunbar. The Indian, a more genuine primitive, has been"
1348,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,as difficult to transplant poetically as he has been to assimilate
1349,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"ethnically. But, in spite of the racial differences in sentiment,"
1350,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"religion and philosophy, brave attempts to bring the spirit of the"
1351,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"Indian originals into our poetry have been made by Mary Austin,"
1352,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"Constance Lindsay Skinner, Natalie Curtis Burlin, Lew Sarett and Alice"
1353,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,Corbin Henderson.
1354,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,
1355,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,In the West today there is a revival of interest in backwoods melodies
1356,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,and folk-created verse. John A. Lomax has published two volumes of
1357,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"cowboy songs—most of them anonymous—full of tang, wild fancy and robust"
1358,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,humor. The tradition of Harte and Hay is being carried on by such racy
1359,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"interpreters as Harry Herbert Knibbs, Badger Clark and Edwin Ford Piper."
1360,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"But, of all contemporaries who approximate the spirit of folk-poetry,"
1361,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,none has made more striking or more indubitably American contributions
1362,THE NEW FOLK-POETRY,"than Vachel Lindsay of Springfield, Illinois."

1365,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS"
1366,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",
1367,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",Lindsay is essentially a people’s poet. He does not hesitate to express
1368,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",himself in terms of the lowest common denominator; his fingers are
1369,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",alternately on his pen and the public pulse. Living near enough the
1370,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","South to appreciate the negro and yet not too near to despise him,"
1371,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","Lindsay has been tremendously influenced by the colorful suggestions,"
1372,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","the fantastic superstitions, the revivalistic gusto, the half-savage"
1373,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","Christianity and, above all, by the curiously syncopated music that"
1374,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","characterize the black man in America. In “The Congo,” “John Brown” and"
1375,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","the less extended but equally remarkable “Simon Legree,” the words roll"
1376,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","with the solemnity of an exhortation, dance with a grotesque fervor or"
1377,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","snap, crackle, wink and leap with all the humorous rhythms of a piece of"
1378,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",“ragtime.” Lindsay catches the burly color and boisterous music of
1379,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","camp-meetings, minstrel shows, revival jubilees."
1380,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",
1381,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",And Lindsay does more. He carries his democratic determinations further
1382,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",than any of his _confrères_. His dream is of a great communal Art; he
1383,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","preaches the gospel that all villages should be centers of beauty, all"
1384,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","its citizens, artists. At heart a missionary even more than a minstrel,"
1385,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","Lindsay often loses himself in his own evangelism; worse, he frequently"
1386,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",cheapens himself and caricatures his own gift by pandering to the
1387,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",vaudeville instinct that insists on putting a noisy “punch” into
1388,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","everything, regardless of taste, artistry or a sense of proportion. He"
1389,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","is most impressive when he is least frenetic, when he is purely"
1390,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",fantastic (as in “The Chinese Nightingale” or the series of metaphorical
1391,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",poems about the moon) or when a greater theme and a finer restraint
1392,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",unite (as in “The Eagle That Is Forgotten”) to create a preaching that
1393,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",does not cease to be poetry.
1394,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",
1395,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",Something of the same blend of prophet and poet is found in the work of
1396,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",James Oppenheim. Oppenheim is a throwback to the ancient Hebrew singers;
1397,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","the music of the Psalms rolls through his lines, the fire of Isaiah"
1398,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","kindles his spirit. This poetry, with its obvious reminders of Whitman,"
1399,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","is biblical in its inflection, Oriental in its heat; it runs through"
1400,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",forgotten centuries and brings buried Asia to busy America. It carries
1401,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","to the Western world the color of the East, adding the gift of prophecy"
1402,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",to pragmatic purpose. In books like _War and Laughter_ and _Songs for
1403,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",the New Age_ the race of god-breakers and god-makers speaks with a new
1404,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","voice; here, with analytic intensity, the old iconoclasm and still older"
1405,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",worship are again united.

1409,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",The new poets have won their way by their differences as well as by
1410,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","their chance similarities. They belong to no one school, represent no"
1411,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","single tendency and, differing widely from their present-day English"
1412,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","fellow-craftsmen, are far less hampered by the burdens of traditions or"
1413,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",the necessity of casting them off. They are more nearly free. One sees
1414,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",this even in the work of the more deliberately conventional singers.
1415,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",Lyricists like Sara Teasdale and Edna St. Vincent Millay write in a
1416,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","clean, straightforward idiom, an intense naturalness that is a frank"
1417,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",commentary on the tinkling and over-sentimental verse that used to pass
1418,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",for genuine emotion. Robert Frost and E. A. Robinson continue to use the
1419,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",strictest rhymes and most rigid meters and yet their lines are as
1420,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","“modern,” as searching as the freest free verse. Form _per se_ matters"
1421,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",scarcely at all; all forms are employed. Conrad Aiken achieves a
1422,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","flexible combination of rhyme and assonance. Sandburg, “H. D.,”"
1423,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","Kreymborg and John Gould Fletcher dispense, for the most part, with"
1424,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","rhyme, without sacrificing the beauty of sound or stress. Masters and"
1425,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",Amy Lowell use the old forms and the new ones with impartiality and
1426,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",equal skill. A sweeping inclusiveness distinguishes our contemporary
1427,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","verse; it embraces all themes, all cultures, all modes of expression."
1428,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",America has become a melting-pot in a poetic as well as an ethnic sense.
1429,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",The rich variety of its structure and subject-matter is in striking
1430,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","opposition to the thin, specialized product of the transition poets. New"
1431,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS",England is no longer the single literary center. As the country has
1432,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","matured, the poets have grown with it, singing everywhere and, much to"
1433,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","Art’s confusion, in every key. It is as if submerged springs had burst"
1434,"LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS","through stubborn ground; instead of one placid stream, there are a dozen"

1439,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,
1440,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"It is difficult to draw a line between periods, especially when one is"
1441,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,called upon to define “modernity.” But in the case of the development of
1442,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"American poetry, the task is made easier by Whitman. Whitman ended and"
1443,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,began an epoch. This collection therefore begins where he left off; it
1444,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"might well be called, “American Poetry Since Whitman.”"
1445,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,
1446,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,It would have been pleasant to divide the poetry itself into groups and
1447,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,distinct tendencies. Unfortunately such a scheme is impossible. In the
1448,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"first place, one can scarcely get a proper perspective on contemporary"
1449,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"writers (on whom the chief emphasis has been placed), especially since"
1450,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"many of them are still developing. Secondly, one cannot give the picture"
1451,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,of a period in the state of flux except by showing its fluid character.
1452,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,The prime object of this collection is to reflect this very flux and
1453,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"diversity—particularly illustrated by those poets who, because of their"
1454,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"strong individualism, would not fit in any one grouping. Since the"
1455,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"chronological arrangement is, therefore, the most logical one, an"
1456,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,arbitrary boundary has been fixed. The year 1830 becomes the
1457,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,dividing-line; any poet born earlier than that date is ruthlessly
1458,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"excluded. This, fortunately, eliminates scarcely any poet of value; for"
1459,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"between Whitman (born 1819) and Emily Dickinson (that early imagist),"
1460,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"there were no singers more memorable than the Cary sisters, Bayard"
1461,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,Taylor and the painfully precise Richard Henry Stoddard.
1462,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,
1463,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,It is a happy circumstance that this volume should begin with Emily
1464,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"Dickinson, whose work, posthumously printed, was unknown as late as 1890"
1465,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,and scarcely noticed until several years later. For here is a forerunner
1466,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"of the new spirit—free in expression, unhampered in choice of subject,"
1467,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,penetrative in psychology—to which a countryful of writers has
1468,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"responded. No longer confined to one or two literary centers, the"
1469,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"impulse to create is everywhere. There is scarcely a state, barely a"
1470,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"township, that has not produced its laureate."
1471,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,
1472,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,Most of the poets represented in these pages have found a fresh and
1473,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,vigorous material in a world of honest and often harsh reality. They
1474,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"respond to the spirit of their times; not only have their views changed,"
1475,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,their vision has been widened to include things unknown to the poet of
1476,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,yesterday. They have learned to distinguish real beauty from mere
1477,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,prettiness; to wring loveliness out of squalor; to find wonder in
1478,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,neglected places; to search for hidden truths even in the dark caves of
1479,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,the unconscious.
1480,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,
1481,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"And with the use of the material of everyday life, there has come a"
1482,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,further simplification: the use of the language of everyday speech. The
1483,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,stilted and mouth-filling phrases have been practically discarded in
1484,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,favor of words that are part of our daily vocabulary. It would be hard
1485,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,at present to find a representative poet employing such awkward and
1486,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"outworn contractions as _’twixt_, _’mongst_, _ope’_; such evidences of"
1487,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"poor padding as _adown_, _did go_, _doth smile_; such dull rubber-stamps"
1488,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"(_clichés_ is the French term) as _heavenly blue_, _roseate glow_,"
1489,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"_golden hope_, _girlish grace_, _gentle breeze_, etc. The"
1490,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"_peradventures_, _forsooths_ and _mayhaps_ have disappeared.... And, as"
1491,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"the speech of the modern poet has grown less elaborate, so have the"
1492,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"patterns that embody it. Not necessarily discarding rhyme, regular"
1493,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"rhythm or any of the musical assets of the older poets, the forms have"
1494,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,grown simpler; the intricate versification has given way to lines that
1495,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,reflect and suggest the tones of animated and even exalted speech. The
1496,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,result of this has been a great gain both in sincerity and intensity; it
1497,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,has enabled the poet of today to put greater emphasis on his emotion
1498,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,rather than on the shell that covers it—he can dwell with richer detail
1499,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,on the matter instead of the manner.
1500,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,
1501,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,One could go into minute particulars concerning the growth of an
1502,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,American spirit in our literature and point out how many of the
1503,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,latter-day poets have responded to native forces larger than their
1504,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,backgrounds. Such a course would be endless and unprofitable. It is
1505,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"pertinent, however, to observe that, young as this nation is, it is"
1506,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"already being supplied with the stuff of legends, ballads and even"
1507,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,epics. The modern singer has turned to celebrate his own folk-tales. It
1508,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,is particularly interesting to observe how the figure of Lincoln has
1509,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,been treated by the best of our living poets. I have accordingly
1510,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"included seven poems by seven writers, each differing in manner,"
1511,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,technique and point of view.
1512,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,
1513,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"For the rest, I leave the casual reader, as well as the student, to"
1514,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"discover the awakened vigor and energy in this, one of the few great"
1515,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,poetic periods in native literature. With the realization that this
1516,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"brief gathering is not so much a summary as an introduction, it is hoped"
1517,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"that, in spite of its limitations, this collection will draw the reader"
1518,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,on to a closer consideration of the poets here included—even to those
1519,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,omitted. The purpose of such an anthology must always be to stimulate an
1520,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,"interest rather than to satisfy a curiosity. Such, at least, is the hope"
1521,SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT,and aim of one editor.

1539,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"Emily Dickinson, whose work is one of the most original"
1540,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"contributions to recent poetry, was born in Amherst, Massachusetts,"
1541,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"December 10, 1830. She was a physical as well as a spiritual hermit,"
1542,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,actually spending most of her life without setting foot beyond her
1543,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"doorstep. She wrote her short, introspective verses without thought"
1544,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"of publication, and it was not until 1890, four years after her"
1545,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"death, that the first volume of her posthumous poetry appeared with"
1546,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,an introduction by Thomas Wentworth Higginson.
1547,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,
1548,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"“She habitually concealed her mind, like her person, from all but a"
1549,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"very few friends,” writes Higginson, “and it was with great"
1550,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during her lifetime,"
1551,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,three or four poems.” Yet she wrote almost five hundred of these
1552,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"direct and spontaneous illuminations, sending many of them in"
1553,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"letters to friends, or (written on chance slips of paper and"
1554,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,delivered without further comment) to her sister Sue. Slowly the
1555,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,peculiar Blake-like quality of her thought won a widening circle of
1556,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,readers; _Poems_ (1890) was followed by _Poems—Second Series_ (1892)
1557,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"and _Poems—Third Series_ (1896), the contents being collected and"
1558,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"edited by her two friends, Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel"
1559,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"Loomis Todd. Several years later, a further generous volume was"
1560,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"assembled by her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, entitled _The"
1561,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,Single Hound_ (1914)—almost all of the new poems (to which Mrs.
1562,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,Bianchi wrote a preface of great personal value) being a record of
1563,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,Emily Dickinson’s romantic friendship for her sister.
1564,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,
1565,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"The sharp quality of her work, with its cool precision and clear"
1566,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"imagery, makes her akin, at least in technique, to the later"
1567,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,Imagists. (See Preface.) But a passionate and almost mystical warmth
1568,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,brings her closer to the great ones of her time. “An epigrammatic
1569,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"Walt Whitman,” some one has called her, a characterization which,"
1570,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"while enthusiastic to the point of exaggeration, expresses the"
1571,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"direction if not the execution of her art. Technically, Emily"
1572,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,Dickinson’s work was strikingly uneven; many of her poems are no
1573,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"more than rough sketches, awkwardly filled in; even some of her"
1574,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,finest lines are marred by the intrusion of merely trivial conceits
1575,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,or forced “thought-rhymes.” But the best of her work is incomparable
1576,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,in its strange cadence and quiet intensity. Her verses are like a
1577,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"box of many jewels, sparkling in their brilliancy, cameo-like in"
1578,MODERN AMERICAN POETRY,"their delicate contours, opalescent in their buried fires."

1687,BECLOUDED,_Thomas Bailey Aldrich_
1688,BECLOUDED,
1689,BECLOUDED,
1690,BECLOUDED,"Thomas Bailey Aldrich was born in 1836 at Portsmouth, New Hampshire,"
1691,BECLOUDED,where he spent most of the sixteen years which he has recorded in
1692,BECLOUDED,"that delightful memoir, _The Story of a Bad Boy_ (1869). After a"
1693,BECLOUDED,"brief clerkship, he became junior literary critic of _The Evening"
1694,BECLOUDED,"Mirror_ at nineteen, publishing his first book (_The Bells_), an"
1695,BECLOUDED,"immature collection of echoes, at the same time. From 1855 to 1866"
1696,BECLOUDED,"he held various journalistic positions, associating himself with the"
1697,BECLOUDED,leading metropolitan _literati_. But though Aldrich mingled with the
1698,BECLOUDED,"New York group, he was not part of it; he longed for the more"
1699,BECLOUDED,"rarefied intellectual atmosphere of New England and when, in 1866,"
1700,BECLOUDED,"Osgood offered him the editorship of _Every Saturday_, published in"
1701,BECLOUDED,"Boston, Aldrich accepted with alacrity. A few years later he became"
1702,BECLOUDED,"editor of the famous _Atlantic Monthly_, holding that position from"
1703,BECLOUDED,1881 to 1890.
1704,BECLOUDED,
1705,BECLOUDED,Aldrich’s work falls into two sharply-divided classes. The first
1706,BECLOUDED,"half is full of overloaded phrase-making, fervid extravagances; the"
1707,BECLOUDED,"reader sinks beneath clouds of damask, azure, emerald, pearl and"
1708,BECLOUDED,"gold; he is drowned in a sea of musk, aloes, tiger-lilies, spice,"
1709,BECLOUDED,"soft music, orchids, attar-breathing dusks. There is no real air in"
1710,BECLOUDED,these verses; it is Nature as conceived by a poet reading the
1711,BECLOUDED,"Arabian Nights in a hot-house. In company with Stoddard and Taylor,"
1712,BECLOUDED,he dwelt in a literary Orientalism—(Stoddard’s _Book of the East_
1713,BECLOUDED,followed fast upon Taylor’s _Poems of the Orient_)—and Aldrich’s
1714,BECLOUDED,_Cloth of Gold_ was suffused with similar “vanilla-flavored
1715,BECLOUDED,"adjectives and patchouli-scented participles” (to quote Holmes),"
1716,BECLOUDED,laboring hard to create an exotic atmosphere by a wearisome
1717,BECLOUDED,"profusion of lotus blossoms, sandalwood, spikenard, blown roses,"
1718,BECLOUDED,"diaphanous gauzes, etc."
1719,BECLOUDED,
1720,BECLOUDED,The second phase of Aldrich’s art is more human in appeal as it is
1721,BECLOUDED,"surer in artistry. He learned to sharpen his images, to fashion his"
1722,BECLOUDED,smallest lyrics with a remarkable _finesse_. “In the little steel
1723,BECLOUDED,"engravings that are the best expressions of his peculiar talent,”"
1724,BECLOUDED,"writes Percy H. Boynton, “there is a fine simplicity; but it is the"
1725,BECLOUDED,simplicity of an accomplished woman of the world rather than of a
1726,BECLOUDED,village maid.” Although Aldrich bitterly resented the charge that he
1727,BECLOUDED,"was a maker of tiny perfections, a carver of cherry-stones, these"
1728,BECLOUDED,poems of his which have the best chance of permanence are some of
1729,BECLOUDED,"the epigrams, the short lyrics and a few of the sonnets, passionless"
1730,BECLOUDED,in tone but exquisite in design.
1731,BECLOUDED,
1732,BECLOUDED,The best of Aldrich’s diffuse poetry has been collected in an
1733,BECLOUDED,"inclusive Household Edition, published by Houghton, Mifflin and"
1734,BECLOUDED,Company. He died in 1907.

1791,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,
1792,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,
1793,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"John Hay was born at Salem, Indiana, in 1838, graduated from Brown"
1794,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,University in 1858 and was admitted to the Illinois bar a few years
1795,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"later. At nineteen, when he went back to Warsaw, the little"
1796,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"Mississippi town where he had lived as a boy, he dreamed only of"
1797,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"being a poet—a poet, it must be added, of the pleasantly"
1798,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"conventional, transition type. But the Civil War was to disturb his"
1799,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"mild fantasies. He became private secretary to Lincoln, then major"
1800,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"and assistant adjutant-general under General Gilmore, then secretary"
1801,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"of the Legation at Paris, _chargé d’affaires_ at Vienna and"
1802,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,secretary of legation at Madrid.
1803,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,
1804,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,His few vivid _Pike County Ballads_ came more as a happy accident
1805,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,than as a deliberate creative effort. When Hay returned from Spain
1806,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"in 1870, bringing with him his _Castilian Days_, he still had"
1807,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,visions of becoming an orthodox lyric poet. But he found everyone
1808,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,reading Bret Harte’s short stories and the new expression of the
1809,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,rude West. (See Preface.) He speculated upon the possibility of
1810,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"doing something similar, translating the characters into poetry. The"
1811,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,result was the six racy ballads in a vein utterly different from
1812,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,everything Hay wrote before or after. The poet-politician seems to
1813,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"have regarded this series somewhat in the nature of light, extempore"
1814,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"verse, belonging to a far lower plane than his serious publications;"
1815,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"he talked about them reluctantly, he even hoped that they would be"
1816,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,forgotten. It is difficult to say whether this regret grew because
1817,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"Hay, loving the refinements of culture, at heart hated any"
1818,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"suggestion of vulgarity, or because of a basic lack of courage—Hay"
1819,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,having published his novel of labor unrest in the early 80’s (_The
1820,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,Breadwinners_) anonymously.
1821,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,
1822,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"The fact remains, his rhymes of Pike County have survived all his"
1823,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"more classical lines. They served for a time as a fresh influence,"
1824,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,they remain a creative accomplishment.
1825,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,
1826,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,"Hay was in politics all the later part of his life, ranking as one"
1827,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,of the most brilliant Secretaries of State the country has ever had.
1828,PESSIMIST AND OPTIMIST,He died in 1905.

1969,BANTY TIM,
1970,BANTY TIM,
1971,BANTY TIM,"(Francis) Bret Harte was born August 25, 1839, at Albany, New York."
1972,BANTY TIM,His childhood was spent in various cities of the East. Late in 1853
1973,BANTY TIM,"his widowed mother went to California with a party of relatives, and"
1974,BANTY TIM,"two months later, when he was fifteen, Bret Harte and his sister"
1975,BANTY TIM,followed. He dreamed even at this age of being a poet. During the
1976,BANTY TIM,"next few years he was engaged in school-teaching, typesetting,"
1977,BANTY TIM,"politics, mining and journalism, becoming editor of _The Overland"
1978,BANTY TIM,Monthly_ at San Francisco in 1868.
1979,BANTY TIM,
1980,BANTY TIM,Harte’s fame came suddenly. Late in the sixties he had written a
1981,BANTY TIM,burlesque in rhyme of two Western gamblers trying to fleece a
1982,BANTY TIM,"guileless Chinaman who claimed to know nothing about cards but who,"
1983,BANTY TIM,"it turned out, was scarcely as innocent as he appeared. Harte, in"
1984,BANTY TIM,"the midst of writing serious poetry, had put the verses aside as too"
1985,BANTY TIM,"crude and trifling for publication. Some time later, just as _The"
1986,BANTY TIM,"Overland Monthly_ was going to press, it was discovered that the"
1987,BANTY TIM,"form was one page short. Having nothing else on hand, Harte had"
1988,BANTY TIM,"these rhymes set up. Instead of passing unnoticed, the poem was"
1989,BANTY TIM,quoted everywhere; it swept the West and captivated the East. When
1990,BANTY TIM,"_The Luck of Roaring Camp_ followed, Harte became not only a"
1991,BANTY TIM,national but an international figure. England acclaimed him and _The
1992,BANTY TIM,"Atlantic Monthly_ paid him $10,000 to write for a year in his Pike"
1993,BANTY TIM,County vein.
1994,BANTY TIM,
1995,BANTY TIM,_East and West Poems_ appeared in 1871; in 1872 he published an
1996,BANTY TIM,enlarged _Poetical Works_ including many earlier pieces. His scores

2155,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,
2156,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,
2157,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"Cincinnatus (Heine) Miller, or, to give him the name he adopted,"
2158,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"Joaquin Miller, was born in 1841 of immigrant parents. As he himself"
2159,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"writes, “My cradle was a covered wagon, pointed west. I was born in"
2160,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"a covered wagon, I am told, at or about the time it crossed the line"
2161,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"dividing Indiana from Ohio.” When Miller was twelve, his family left"
2162,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"the mid-West with “two big heavily laden wagons, with eight yoke of"
2163,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"oxen to each, a carriage and two horses for mother and baby sister,"
2164,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,and a single horse for the three boys to ride.” The distance covered
2165,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,in their cross-country exodus (they took a roundabout route to
2166,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"Oregon) was nearly three thousand miles. The time consumed, he"
2167,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"records, “was seven months and five days. There were no bridges, no"
2168,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"railroad levels, nothing of the sort.... Many times, at night, after"
2169,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"ascending a stream to find a ford, we could look back and see our"
2170,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,smouldering camp-fires of the day before.” This journey made a
2171,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,lasting impression on the boy’s impressionable mind; it was this
2172,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,tortuous wandering that gave Miller his reverence for the
2173,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,spaciousness and glory of the West in general and the pioneer in
2174,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"particular. After two years in the Oregon home, he ran away to find"
2175,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,gold.
2176,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,
2177,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,At fifteen we find Miller living with the Indians as one of them; in
2178,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,1859 (at the age of eighteen) he attends a missionschool “college”
2179,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"in Eugene, Oregon; between 1860 and 1865 he is express-messenger,"
2180,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,editor of a pacifist newspaper that is suppressed for opposing the
2181,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"Civil War, lawyer and, occasionally, a poet. He holds a minor"
2182,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,judgeship from 1866 to 1870.
2183,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,
2184,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"His first book (_Specimens_) appears in 1868, his second (_Joaquin"
2185,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"et al._, from which he took his name) in 1869. No response—not even"
2186,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,from “the bards of San Francisco Bay” to whom he had dedicated the
2187,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"latter volume. He is chagrined, discouraged, angry. He resolves to"
2188,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"quit America, to go to the land that has always been the"
2189,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"nursing-ground of poets. “Three months later, September 1, 1870, I"
2190,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,was kneeling at the grave of Burns. I really expected to die there
2191,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"in the land of my fathers.” He arrives in London, unheralded,"
2192,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,unknown. He takes his manuscripts to one publisher after another
2193,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"with the same negative result. Finally, with a pioneer desperation,"
2194,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"he prints privately one hundred copies of his _Pacific Poems_,"
2195,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,sending them out for review. Sensation! The reversal of Miller’s
2196,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,fortunes is one of the most startling in all literature. He becomes
2197,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"famous overnight. He is fêted, lauded, lionized; he is ranked as an"
2198,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"equal of Browning, given a dinner by the Pre-Raphaelites, acclaimed"
2199,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"as “the great interpreter of America,” “the Bryon of Oregon”!"
2200,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,
2201,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,His dramatic success in England is easily explained. He brought to
2202,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"the calm air of literary London, a breath of the great winds of the"
2203,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"plain. The more he exaggerated his crashing effects, the louder he"
2204,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"roared, the better the English public liked it. When he entered"
2205,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"Victorian parlors in his velvet jacket, hip-boots and flowing hair,"
2206,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,childhood visions of the “wild and woolly Westerner” were realized
2207,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,and the very bombast of his work was glorified as “typically
2208,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,American.”
2209,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,
2210,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"And yet, for all his overstressed muscularity, Miller is strangely"
2211,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,lacking in creative energy. His exuberance and whipped up rhetoric
2212,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"cannot disguise the essential weakness of his verse. It is, in spite"
2213,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,of a certain breeziness and a few magnificent descriptions of cañons
2214,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"and mountain-chains, feeble as well as false, full of cheap heroics,"
2215,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,atrocious taste and impossible men and women. (See Preface.) One or
2216,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"two individual poems, like “Crossing the Plains” and parts of his"
2217,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"apostrophes to the Sierras, the Pacific Ocean and the Missouri river"
2218,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,may live; the rest seem doomed to a gradual extinction.
2219,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,
2220,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"From 1872 to 1886, Miller traveled about the Continent. In 1887 he"
2221,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"returned to California, dwelling on the Heights, helping to found an"
2222,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"experimental Greek academy for aspiring writers. He died there,"
2223,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,"after a determinedly picturesque life, in sight of the Golden Gate,"
2224,PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,in 1913.

2375,DARE YOU?,emphasizes—even overstresses—the influence of music on poetry. He
2376,DARE YOU?,"attended Oglethorpe College, graduating at the age of eighteen"
2377,DARE YOU?,"(1860), and, a year later, volunteered as a private in the"
2378,DARE YOU?,Confederate army. After several months’ imprisonment (he had been
2379,DARE YOU?,"captured while acting as signal officer on a blockade-runner),"
2380,DARE YOU?,"Lanier was released in February, 1865, returning from Point Lookout"
2381,DARE YOU?,"to Georgia on foot, accompanied only by his flute, from which he"
2382,DARE YOU?,"refused to be separated. His physical health, never the most robust,"
2383,DARE YOU?,"had been frightfully impaired by his incarceration, and he was"
2384,DARE YOU?,"already suffering from tuberculosis, the rest of his life being"
2385,DARE YOU?,spent in an unequal struggle against it.
2386,DARE YOU?,
2387,DARE YOU?,He was now only twenty-three years old and the problem of choosing a
2388,DARE YOU?,vocation was complicated by his marriage in 1867. He spent five
2389,DARE YOU?,"years in the study and practice of law, during which time he wrote"
2390,DARE YOU?,comparatively little verse. But the law could not hold him; he felt
2391,DARE YOU?,premonitions of death and realized he must devote his talents to art
2392,DARE YOU?,before it was too late. He was fortunate enough to obtain a position
2393,DARE YOU?,as flautist with the Peabody Symphony Orchestra in 1873 in
2394,DARE YOU?,"Baltimore, where he had free access to the music and literature he"
2395,DARE YOU?,"craved. Here he wrote all of his best poetry. In 1879, he was made"
2396,DARE YOU?,"lecturer on English in Johns Hopkins University, and it was for his"
2397,DARE YOU?,"courses there that he wrote his chief prose work, a brilliant if not"
2398,DARE YOU?,"conclusive study, _The Science of English Verse_. Besides his"
2399,DARE YOU?,"poetry, he wrote several books for boys, the two most popular being"
2400,DARE YOU?,_The Boy’s Froissart_ (1878) and _The Boy’s King Arthur_ (1880).
2401,DARE YOU?,
2402,DARE YOU?,"Lanier’s poetry, charming though most of it is, suffers from his all"
2403,DARE YOU?,"too frequent theorizing, his too conscious effort to bring verse"
2404,DARE YOU?,"over into the province of pure music. He thought almost entirely,"
2405,DARE YOU?,"even in his most intellectual conceptions, in terms of musical form."
2406,DARE YOU?,His main theory that English verse has for its essential basis not
2407,DARE YOU?,_accent_ but a strict musical _quantity_ is a wholly erroneous
2408,DARE YOU?,"conclusion, possible only to one who could write “whatever turn I"
2409,DARE YOU?,have for art is purely musical—poetry being with me a mere tangent
2410,DARE YOU?,"into which I shoot.” Lanier is at his best in his ballads, although"
2411,DARE YOU?,a few of his lyrics have a similar spontaneity. In spite of the fact
2412,DARE YOU?,"that he had rather novel schemes of rhythm and stanza-structure,"
2413,DARE YOU?,"much of his work is marred by strained effects, elaborate conceits"
2414,DARE YOU?,and a kind of verse that approaches mere pattern-making. But such a
2415,DARE YOU?,"vigorous ballad as “The Song of the Chattahoochee,” lyrics like"
2416,DARE YOU?,"“Night and Day” and “The Stirrup Cup,” and parts of the symphonic"
2417,DARE YOU?,“Hymns of the Marshes” are sure of a place in American literature.
2418,DARE YOU?,"Never a great figure, he was one of the most interesting and"
2419,DARE YOU?,spiritual of our minor poets.
2420,DARE YOU?,
2421,DARE YOU?,"Lanier died, a victim of his disease, in the mountains of North"
2422,DARE YOU?,"Carolina, September 7, 1881."

2691,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,office and joined a traveling troupe of actors who sold patent

2693,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,"he beat the bass-drum, painted their flaring banners, wrote local"
2694,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,"versions of old songs, coached the actors and, when occasion arose,"

2711,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,_Rhymes of Childhood_ (1890). All met an instant response; Riley
2712,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,"endeared himself, by his homely idiom and his childlike ingenuity,"
2713,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,"to a countryful of readers, adolescent and adult."

2717,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,unsophisticated readers; he sees them about to smile—and broadens
2718,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,the point of his joke; he observes them on the point of tears—and
2719,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,"pulls out the sobbing _tremolo_ stop. In many respects, he is"
2720,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,patently the most artificial of those poets who claim to give us the
2721,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,stuff of the soil. He is the poet of obtrusive sentiment rather than
2722,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,"of quiet convictions; of lulling assurance, of philosophies that"
2723,ROBINSON CRUSOE’S STORY,"never disturb his readers, of sweet truisms rather than searching"

2791,A PARTING GUEST[8],_Eugene Field_
2792,A PARTING GUEST[8],
2793,A PARTING GUEST[8],
2794,A PARTING GUEST[8],"Although born (September 3, 1850) in St. Louis, Missouri, Eugene"
2795,A PARTING GUEST[8],Field belongs to the literature of the far West. Colorado and the
2796,A PARTING GUEST[8],Rocky Mountain region claimed him as their own and Field never
2797,A PARTING GUEST[8],repudiated the allegiance; he even called most of his poetry
2798,A PARTING GUEST[8],“Western Verse.”
2799,A PARTING GUEST[8],
2800,A PARTING GUEST[8],"Field’s area of education embraced New England, Missouri, and what"
2801,A PARTING GUEST[8],European territory he could cover in six months. At twenty-three he
2802,A PARTING GUEST[8],"became a reporter on the St. Louis _Evening Journal_, the rest of"
2803,A PARTING GUEST[8],"his life being given, with a dogged devotion, to journalism. Driven"
2804,A PARTING GUEST[8],by the demands of his unique daily columns (those on the Denver
2805,A PARTING GUEST[8],_Tribune_ [1881–1883] and the Chicago _Daily News_ [1883–1895] were
2806,A PARTING GUEST[8],"widely copied), Field first capitalized and then standardized his"
2807,A PARTING GUEST[8],"high spirits, his erudition, his whimsicality, his fondness for"
2808,A PARTING GUEST[8],children. He wrote so often with his tongue in his cheek that it is
2809,A PARTING GUEST[8],difficult to say where true sentiment stops and an exaggerated
2810,A PARTING GUEST[8],"sentimentality begins. “Field,” says Fred Lewis Pattee, in his"
2811,A PARTING GUEST[8],"detailed study of _American Literature Since 1870_, “more than any"
2812,A PARTING GUEST[8],"other writer of the period, illustrates the way the old type of"
2813,A PARTING GUEST[8],literary scholar was to be modified and changed by the newspaper.
2814,A PARTING GUEST[8],Every scrap of Field’s voluminous product was written for immediate
2815,A PARTING GUEST[8],newspaper consumption. He patronized not at all the literary
2816,A PARTING GUEST[8],"magazines, he wrote his books not at all with book intent—he made"
2817,A PARTING GUEST[8],them up from newspaper fragments.... He was a pioneer in a peculiar
2818,A PARTING GUEST[8],"province: he stands for the journalization of literature, a process"
2819,A PARTING GUEST[8],"that, if carried to its logical extreme, will make of the man of"
2820,A PARTING GUEST[8],letters a mere newspaper reporter.”
2821,A PARTING GUEST[8],
2822,A PARTING GUEST[8],"Though Field still may be overrated in some quarters, there is"
2823,A PARTING GUEST[8],"little doubt that certain of his child lyrics, his homely"
2824,A PARTING GUEST[8],philosophic ballads (in the vein which Harte and Riley popularized)
2825,A PARTING GUEST[8],and his brilliant burlesques will occupy a niche in American
2826,A PARTING GUEST[8],letters. Readers of all tastes will find much to surprise and
2827,A PARTING GUEST[8],"delight them in _A Little Book of Western Verse_ (1889), _With"
2828,A PARTING GUEST[8],"Trumpet and Drum_ (1892), _A Second Book of Verse_ (1893) and those"
2829,A PARTING GUEST[8],"remarkable versions (and perversions) of Horace, _Echoes from the"
2830,A PARTING GUEST[8],Sabine Farm_ (1893) written in collaboration with his equally adroit
2831,A PARTING GUEST[8],"brother, Roswell M. Field. A complete one-volume edition of his"

2960,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],reached his fifth year and in 1857 he was taken by his mother to a
2961,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],wild valley in the Suisun Hills in central California. Here he grew
2962,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"to young manhood; farming, broncho-riding, laboring on a cattle"

2964,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],supplementing his studies with whatever books he could procure. At

2974,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"in effect. Suddenly, in 1899, a new force surged through him; a"
2975,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],sense of outrage at the inequality of human struggle voiced itself
2976,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"in the sweeping and sonorous poem, “The Man with the Hoe.” (See"
2977,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"Preface.) Inspired by Millet’s painting, Markham made the bowed,"
2978,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],broken French peasant a symbol of the poverty-stricken toiler in all
2979,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"lands—his was a protest not against labor but the drudgery, the"
2980,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],soul-destroying exploitation of labor. “The Yeoman is the landed and
2981,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"well-to-do farmer,” says Markham, “you need shed no tears for him."
2982,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],But here in the Millet picture is his opposite—the Hoeman; the
2983,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"landless, the soul-blighted workman of the world, the dumb creature"
2984,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"that has no time to rest, no time to think, no time for the hopes"
2985,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"that make us men.” ... “The Man with the Hoe,” with its demand for a"
2986,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"keener sense of social responsibility, was not wholly cast in the"
2987,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],key of challenge. It looked to a more expansive future when “all
2988,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],workers will think and all thinkers will work”; it answered Music’s
2989,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"great trio of B.’s (Bach, Beethoven, Brahms) with the need of a"
2990,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"greater three: “Bread, Beauty and Brotherhood.”"
2991,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],
2992,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],The success of the poem upon its appearance in the San Francisco
2993,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"_Examiner_ (January 15, 1899) was instantaneous and universal. The"
2994,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],lines appeared in every part of the globe; it was quoted and copied
2995,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"in every walk of life, in the literary world, the leisure world, the"
2996,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"labor world. The same year of its publication, it was incorporated"
2997,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"in Markham’s first volume _The Man with the Hoe, and Other Poems_"
2998,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"(1899). Two years later, his almost as well known poem was"
2999,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],published. The same passion that fired Markham to champion the great
3000,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],common workers equipped him to write fittingly of the Great Commoner
3001,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"in _Lincoln, and Other Poems_ (1901). His later volumes are"
3002,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],dignified and melodious but scarcely remarkable. Never reaching the
3003,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],"heights of his two early classics, there are, nevertheless, many"
3004,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],moments of a related nobility in _The Shoes of Happiness_ (1914) and
3005,SEEIN’ THINGS[11],_The Gates of Paradise_ (1920).

3220,THE DESERT,
3221,THE DESERT,
3222,THE DESERT,"Irwin Russell was born, June 3, 1853, at Port Gibson, Mississippi,"
3223,THE DESERT,where he studied law and was admitted to the bar. His restless
3224,THE DESERT,"nature and wayward disposition drove him from one place to another,"
3225,THE DESERT,"from dissipation to dissipation, from a not too rugged health to an"
3226,THE DESERT,"utter breakdown. In July, 1879, he was forced to leave New York,"
3227,THE DESERT,"working his way down to New Orleans on a coast steamer, trying to"
3228,THE DESERT,rehabilitate himself as reporter on the New Orleans _Picayune_. But
3229,THE DESERT,"illness pursued him and the following December Russell died, cut"
3230,THE DESERT,"off, in the midst of his promise, before he had reached his"
3231,THE DESERT,twenty-seventh year.
3232,THE DESERT,
3233,THE DESERT,Although Russell did not take his poetry seriously and though the
3234,THE DESERT,"bulk of it is small, its influence has been large. Thomas Nelson"
3235,THE DESERT,Page and Joel Chandler Harris have acknowledged their indebtedness
3236,THE DESERT,"to him; the creator of Uncle Remus writing, “Irwin Russell was"
3237,THE DESERT,among the first—if not the very first—of Southern writers to
3238,THE DESERT,appreciate the literary possibilities of the negro character.” He
3239,THE DESERT,"entered their life, appreciated their fresh turns of thought, saw"
3240,THE DESERT,things with that peculiar mixture of reverence and unconscious
3241,THE DESERT,humor that is so integral a part of negro songs and spirituals.
3242,THE DESERT,“Blessing the Dance” and “The Song of the Banjo” (from Russell’s
3243,THE DESERT,"operetta _Christmas-Night in the Quarters_, possibly his best"
3244,THE DESERT,known work) are excellent examples; faithful renderings of the
3245,THE DESERT,"mind of the old-fashioned, simple and sententious child of the"
3246,THE DESERT,"plantation. In the latter poem the old story of Noah is told, with"
3247,THE DESERT,"delightful additions, from the colorful angle of the darky; local"
3248,THE DESERT,"in its setting, revealing in its quaint psychology."
3249,THE DESERT,
3250,THE DESERT,"A collection of his poems appeared, with an introduction by Joel"
3251,THE DESERT,"Chandler Harris, in 1888. In 1917, a more inclusive volume,"

3463,A SONG OF SUNRISE,_H. C. Bunner_
3464,A SONG OF SUNRISE,
3465,A SONG OF SUNRISE,
3466,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"Henry Cuyler Bunner, one of our most delightful writers of light"
3467,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"verse, was born at Oswego, New York, in 1855. At twenty-two he was"
3468,A SONG OF SUNRISE,appointed editor of _Puck_ (then the most prominent of comic
3469,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"weeklies), a position which he held until his death. For more than"
3470,A SONG OF SUNRISE,ten years he wrote almost all the rhymed contributions to that
3471,A SONG OF SUNRISE,journal—to say nothing of quantities of short stories (his _Short
3472,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"Sixes_, first published in 1890, are still well-known), prose"
3473,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"paragraphs, topical parodies, editorials, etc. Like Field, the"
3474,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"artist was finally buried in the journalist; but, unlike him, Bunner"
3475,A SONG OF SUNRISE,kept the work of the serious poet separate from that of the
3476,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"manufacturer of satiric trifles. Yet, in spite of certain exquisite"
3477,A SONG OF SUNRISE,fragments in _Airs from Arcady_ (1884) and _Rowen: Second Crop
3478,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"Songs_ (1892), Bunner is likely to be remembered chiefly for his"
3479,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"flippant _vers de société_, his skilful and grave absurdities."
3480,A SONG OF SUNRISE,
3481,A SONG OF SUNRISE,“Behold the Deeds!” is a splendid example of Bunner’s wit and
3482,A SONG OF SUNRISE,technical ingenuity. It is a burlesque of the old ballads in the
3483,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"guise of a Chant-Royal, one of the strictest and most difficult of"
3484,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"the French forms. Another of his uncollected comic pieces (“Shake,"
3485,A SONG OF SUNRISE,Mulleary and Go-ethe”) owes its origin to the fact that a certain
3486,A SONG OF SUNRISE,Western poet (Joaquin Miller) had composed a poem in which the name
3487,A SONG OF SUNRISE,of the author of “Faust” was made to rhyme with “teeth.” Bunner not
3488,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"only adopted this rhyme, but carried the broad satire further by"
3489,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"mispronouncing Molière, achieving one of his happiest compositions."
3490,A SONG OF SUNRISE,
3491,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"Bunner’s was, at best, an artificial world, a world of graceful"
3492,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"compliments, polite evasions, rhymed _billets doux_, with light"
3493,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"sighs and lighter laughter tinkling among the tea-cups. Bunner died,"
3494,A SONG OF SUNRISE,"in New Jersey, in 1896."

3707,SPICEWOOD,_Horace Traubel_
3708,SPICEWOOD,
3709,SPICEWOOD,
3710,SPICEWOOD,"Horace Traubel, often referred to as “Whitman’s Boswell,” was born"
3711,SPICEWOOD,"in Camden, New Jersey, December 19, 1858, of mixed Jewish and"
3712,SPICEWOOD,Christian parentage. His scholastic education was desultory; after
3713,SPICEWOOD,"leaving school he sold newspapers, worked as an errand boy and"
3714,SPICEWOOD,helped his father in a stationery store. Later he became a printer’s
3715,SPICEWOOD,"devil, proof-reader, reporter and editorial writer. In 1873 Walt"
3716,SPICEWOOD,"Whitman came to Camden, little dreaming he would spend the remainder"
3717,SPICEWOOD,"of his life there. He was almost friendless, a sick man, helpless"
3718,SPICEWOOD,and alone. The Traubel household welcomed him in and an
3719,SPICEWOOD,extraordinary friendship sprang up immediately between the aging
3720,SPICEWOOD,poet and the young boy. Traubel saw Whitman some part of each day
3721,SPICEWOOD,"for almost twenty years. “As the years fled,” says David Karsner in"
3722,SPICEWOOD,"his Life of Horace Traubel, “he catered to Whitman’s needs in a"
3723,SPICEWOOD,hundred different ways. He would bring Old Walt such papers and
3724,SPICEWOOD,magazines as he knew would interest him. He ran his errands ... and
3725,SPICEWOOD,assumed the details and responsibilities connected with the
3726,SPICEWOOD,publishing of the later editions of Whitman’s books.” This intimacy
3727,SPICEWOOD,"is fully recorded in Traubel’s chief work, a series of volumes,"
3728,SPICEWOOD,"_With Walt Whitman in Camden_, a compilation of extraordinary value"
3729,SPICEWOOD,which has been called “Whitman’s unconscious autobiography.”
3730,SPICEWOOD,
3731,SPICEWOOD,It is inevitable that Traubel’s own poetry should betray the strong
3732,SPICEWOOD,influence of his great friend and hero. And yet in several poems in
3733,SPICEWOOD,_Optimos_ (1910) and _Chants Communal_ (1914) Traubel achieves a
3734,SPICEWOOD,"personal idiom; beneath the wearying length and repetitive phrases,"
3735,SPICEWOOD,"he communicates the fire of the social revolutionist, the insurgent"
3736,SPICEWOOD,"who wrote, “I build no fires to burn anybody up. I only build fires"
3737,SPICEWOOD,to light up the way.”
3738,SPICEWOOD,
3739,SPICEWOOD,"Traubel died at Bon Echo, Ontario, Canada, where he had gone for his"
3740,SPICEWOOD,"health, September 8, 1919."

3839,O MY DEAD COMRADE,"Frank Dempster Sherman was born at Peekskill, New York, May 6, 1860."
3840,O MY DEAD COMRADE,"He entered Columbia University in 1879, where, after graduation and"
3841,O MY DEAD COMRADE,"a subsequent instructorship, he was made adjunct professor in 1891"
3842,O MY DEAD COMRADE,and Professor of Graphics in 1904. He held the latter position until
3843,O MY DEAD COMRADE,"his death, which occurred September 19, 1916."
3844,O MY DEAD COMRADE,
3845,O MY DEAD COMRADE,"Besides being a writer of airy lyrics and epigrammatic quatrains,"
3846,O MY DEAD COMRADE,Sherman was an enthusiastic genealogist and a designer (especially
3847,O MY DEAD COMRADE,"of book-plates) of no little skill. As a poet, his gift was"
3848,O MY DEAD COMRADE,"essentially that of a writer of light verse—fragrant, fragile, yet"
3849,O MY DEAD COMRADE,"seldom too sentimental or brittle. Pleasant is the name for it, a"

3851,O MY DEAD COMRADE,
3852,O MY DEAD COMRADE,Sherman never wearied of the little lyric; even the titles of his

4044,THE WILD RIDE,_Bliss Carman_
4045,THE WILD RIDE,
4046,THE WILD RIDE,
4047,THE WILD RIDE,"(William) Bliss Carman was born at Fredericton, New Brunswick,"
4048,THE WILD RIDE,"Canada, April 15, 1861, of a long line of United Empire Loyalists"
4049,THE WILD RIDE,who withdrew from Connecticut at the time of the Revolutionary War.
4050,THE WILD RIDE,"Carman was educated at the University of New Brunswick (1879–81), at"
4051,THE WILD RIDE,Edinburgh (1882–3) and Harvard (1886–8). He took up his residence in
4052,THE WILD RIDE,"the United States about 1889 and, with the exception of short"
4053,THE WILD RIDE,"sojourns in the Maritime Provinces, has lived there ever since."
4054,THE WILD RIDE,
4055,THE WILD RIDE,"In 1893, Carman issued his first book, _Low Tide on Grand Pré: A"
4056,THE WILD RIDE,"Book of Lyrics_. It was immediately successful, running quickly into"
4057,THE WILD RIDE,"a second edition. From the outset, it was evident that Carman"
4058,THE WILD RIDE,possessed the true lyrical power: the ability to fuse thought in
4059,THE WILD RIDE,"emotion, to interpret the external world through a personal"
4060,THE WILD RIDE,"intensity. Simple and direct in his choice of themes, his passion"
4061,THE WILD RIDE,"made them universal. A vivid buoyancy, new to American literature,"
4062,THE WILD RIDE,made his worship of Nature frankly pagan as contrasted to the
4063,THE WILD RIDE,moralizing tributes of most of his predecessors. This freshness and
4064,THE WILD RIDE,irresponsible whimsy made Carman the natural collaborator for
4065,THE WILD RIDE,"Richard Hovey, and when their first joint _Songs from Vagabondia_"
4066,THE WILD RIDE,appeared in 1894 Carman’s fame was established. (See Preface.)
4067,THE WILD RIDE,
4068,THE WILD RIDE,Although the three _Vagabondia_ collections contain Carman’s best
4069,THE WILD RIDE,"known poems, several of his other volumes (he has published almost"
4070,THE WILD RIDE,twenty of them) vibrate with the same glowing pulse. An almost
4071,THE WILD RIDE,"physical radiance rises from _Ballads of Lost Haven_ (1897), _From"
4072,THE WILD RIDE,the Book of Myths_ (1902) and _Songs of the Sea Children_ (1904).
4073,THE WILD RIDE,
4074,THE WILD RIDE,"Carman has also written several volumes of essays and, in"
4075,THE WILD RIDE,"conjunction with Mary Perry King, has devised several poem-dances"
4076,THE WILD RIDE,"(_Daughters of Dawn_, 1913) suggesting Vachel Lindsay’s later"
4077,THE WILD RIDE,"poem-games. In his collection _April Airs_ (1916), although the"
4078,THE WILD RIDE,"strength is diluted and the music somewhat thinned, the old magic"
4079,THE WILD RIDE,persists; the spell may be overfamiliar but it is not powerless.

4128,THE GRAVEDIGGER,Is the sexton of the town;

4132,THE GRAVEDIGGER,"But though he delves so fierce and grim,"
4133,THE GRAVEDIGGER,"His honest graves are wide,"

4136,THE GRAVEDIGGER,
4137,THE GRAVEDIGGER,"Oh, he works with a rollicking stave at lip,"

4140,THE GRAVEDIGGER,He batters it down the world.
4141,THE GRAVEDIGGER,
4142,THE GRAVEDIGGER,"He learned it once in his father’s house,"
4143,THE GRAVEDIGGER,Where the ballads of eld were sung;

4145,THE GRAVEDIGGER,But no man knows the tongue.
4146,THE GRAVEDIGGER,
4147,THE GRAVEDIGGER,"Oh, fair, they say, was his bride to see,"
4148,THE GRAVEDIGGER,"And wilful she must have been,"
4149,THE GRAVEDIGGER,That she could bide at his gruesome side
4150,THE GRAVEDIGGER,When the first red dawn came in.
4151,THE GRAVEDIGGER,
4152,THE GRAVEDIGGER,"And sweet, they say, is her kiss to those"

4227,DAISIES,
4228,DAISIES,"Richard (Eugene) Burton was born at Hartford, Connecticut, March 14,"
4229,DAISIES,1861. He has taught English at various colleges and universities
4230,DAISIES,"since 1888, and has been head of the English department of the"
4231,DAISIES,"University of Minnesota since 1906. His first book, _Dumb in June_"
4232,DAISIES,"(1895), is, in many ways, his best. It contains a buoyant lyricism,"
4233,DAISIES,a more conscious use of the strain developed in Carman and Hovey’s
4234,DAISIES,_Songs from Vagabondia_—a mood which he has never surpassed. Much of
4235,DAISIES,"his other verse is far less distinctive, being what might be called"
4236,DAISIES,"“anonymous poetry”: a poetry that has, in spite of certain excellent"
4237,DAISIES,"qualities, little trace of the individual and practically no stamp"
4238,DAISIES,of personality or place. The succeeding _Lyrics of Brotherhood_
4239,DAISIES,(1899) has a wider vision if a more limited music; several of the
4240,DAISIES,"poems in this collection reflect the hungers, dreams and unsung"
4241,DAISIES,melodies of the dumb and defeated multitudes. _From the Book of
4242,DAISIES,Life_ (1909) has scarcely as much power and less poetry.
4243,DAISIES,
4244,DAISIES,"Besides his verse, Burton has written several books of essays, a"
4245,DAISIES,life of Whittier and various volumes on the drama.

4353,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,
4354,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"His first volume, _The Laurel: An Ode_ (1889), betrayed the"

4357,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,the pit of mere technique. His exuberant virility found its outlet
4358,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,in the series of poems published in collaboration with Bliss
4359,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"Carman—the three volumes of _Songs from Vagabondia_ (1894, 1896,"
4360,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,1900). Here he let himself go completely; nothing remained sober or
4361,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,static. His lines fling themselves across the page; dance with
4362,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"intoxicating abandon; shout with a wild irresponsibility; leap,"
4363,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"laugh, carouse and carry off the reader in a gale of high spirits."
4364,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,The famous _Stein Song_ is but an interlude in the midst of a far
4365,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"finer and even more rousing poem that, with its flavor of Whitman,"
4366,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,begins:
4367,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,
4368,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"I said in my heart, “I am sick of four walls and a ceiling."
4369,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,I have need of the sky.
4370,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,I have business with the grass.
4371,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"I will up and get me away where the hawk is wheeling,"
4372,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"Lone and high,"
4373,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,And the slow clouds go by.
4374,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,I will get me away to the waters that glass
4375,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,The clouds as they pass....”
4376,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,
4377,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,Hovey’s attitude to his art may be expressed in no better way than
4378,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"his own words concerning the poet: “It is not his mission,” wrote"
4379,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"Hovey in the _Dartmouth Magazine_, “to write elegant canzonettas for"
4380,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"the delectation of the _dilettanti_, but to comfort the sorrowful"
4381,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"and hearten the despairing, to champion the oppressed and declare to"
4382,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"humanity its inalienable rights, to lay open to the world the heart"
4383,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"of man—all its heights and depths, all its glooms and glories, to"
4384,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,reveal the beauty in things and breathe into his fellows a love of
4385,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,it.” This almost too conscious awareness of the poet’s “mission”
4386,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"often marred Hovey’s work; in responding to his program, he"
4387,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"frequently overstressed his ringing enthusiasm, strained his own"
4388,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,muscularity. But his power was as unflagging as his fraternal energy
4389,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,was persuasive. And in certain quieter moods the poet rose to new
4390,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,heights. The work on which he was engaged at the time of his death
4391,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,is significant; _Launcelot and Guenevere: A Poem in Five Dramas_ is
4392,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,magnificent in its restrained vitality.
4393,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,
4394,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,Although the varied lyrics in _Songs from Vagabondia_ are the best
4395,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,"known examples of Hovey, a more representative collection of his"
4396,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,riper work may be found in _Along the Trail_ (1898). This volume
4397,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,contains “Spring” and the stirring “Comrades” in full as well as the
4398,THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE,best of his vivid fragments.

4545,A STEIN SONG,_Madison Cawein_
4546,A STEIN SONG,
4547,A STEIN SONG,
4548,A STEIN SONG,"Madison (Julius) Cawein was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1865,"
4549,A STEIN SONG,and spent most of his life in the state of his birth. He wrote an
4550,A STEIN SONG,"enormous quantity of verse, publishing more than twenty volumes of"
4551,A STEIN SONG,"pleasant, sometimes exuberant but seldom distinguished poetry."
4552,A STEIN SONG,_Lyrics and Idyls_ (1890) and _Vale of Tempe_ (1905) contain his
4553,A STEIN SONG,"most characteristic stanzas, packed with the lush, adjectival love"
4554,A STEIN SONG,"of Nature that led certain of his admirers to call him (and, one"
4555,A STEIN SONG,"must admit, the alliteration was tempting) “the Keats of Kentucky.”"
4556,A STEIN SONG,
4557,A STEIN SONG,"Cawein’s work divides itself into two distinct veins. In the one, he"
4558,A STEIN SONG,dealt with the scenes and incidents of his mountain environment: the
4559,A STEIN SONG,"sag of an old house in the hills, the echoes of a feud, rumblings of"
4560,A STEIN SONG,"the Ku Klux Klan, the ghastly details of a lynching. In his other"
4561,A STEIN SONG,mood (the one which unfortunately possessed him the greater part of
4562,A STEIN SONG,"the time) he spent page after page romanticizing Nature, touching up"
4563,A STEIN SONG,"his already painted lilies, polishing his thinly-plated"
4564,A STEIN SONG,artificialities until the base metal showed through. He pictured all
4565,A STEIN SONG,"outdoors with painstaking detail. And yet it is somehow unreal,"
4566,A STEIN SONG,"prettified, remote. Every now and then, with an irritating"
4567,A STEIN SONG,"frequency, he tries to transport his audience to a literary"
4568,A STEIN SONG,Fairyland; but the reader is quickly wearied by the almost
4569,A STEIN SONG,"interminable procession of fays, gnomes, nixies, elves, dryads,"
4570,A STEIN SONG,"sprites, pucks, fauns—be they ever so lyrical."
4571,A STEIN SONG,
4572,A STEIN SONG,"In spite of Cawein’s too profuse lyricism, several of his pieces"
4573,A STEIN SONG,"will doubtless remain, though it is not likely that the survivors"
4574,A STEIN SONG,will be the sugared sweetmeats by which his champions (including
4575,A STEIN SONG,William Dean Howells) set such store.

4729,CANOPUS,
4730,CANOPUS,"William Vaughn Moody was born at Spencer, Indiana, July 1, 1869, and"

4732,CANOPUS,"eighteen years of his life in travel and intensive study—he taught,"

4737,CANOPUS,richer and more representative collection appeared the year
4738,CANOPUS,following; in _Poems_ (1901) Moody effected that mingling of
4739,CANOPUS,challenging lyricism and spiritual philosophy which becomes more and
4740,CANOPUS,"more insistent. (See Preface.) Throughout his career, and"
4741,CANOPUS,particularly in such lines as the hotly expostulating “On a Soldier
4742,CANOPUS,"Fallen in the Philippines” and the majestic, uncompleted “The Death"
4743,CANOPUS,"of Eve,” Moody successfully achieves the rare union of poet and"
4744,CANOPUS,preacher. “Gloucester Moors” is an outcry against the few exploiting
4745,CANOPUS,the many; “The Quarry” and “An Ode in Time of Hesitation” are
4746,CANOPUS,"passionate with prophecy. His last, extended works have an epic"

4888,ON A SOLDIER FALLEN IN THE PHILIPPINES,and educated at various private schools in the Eastern States. He
4889,ON A SOLDIER FALLEN IN THE PHILIPPINES,moved to the far West about 1895 and has lived in California ever

4927,THE MASTER MARINER,The lions of the surf that cry
4928,THE MASTER MARINER,Upon this lion-colored shore

4960,THE MASTER MARINER,_Edwin Arlington Robinson_
4961,THE MASTER MARINER,
4962,THE MASTER MARINER,
4963,THE MASTER MARINER,"Edwin Arlington Robinson was born December 22, 1869, in the village"
4964,THE MASTER MARINER,"of Head Tide, Maine. When he was still a child, the Robinson family"
4965,THE MASTER MARINER,"moved to the nearby town of Gardiner, which figures prominently in"
4966,THE MASTER MARINER,Robinson’s poetry as “Tilbury Town.” In 1891 he entered Harvard
4967,THE MASTER MARINER,College. A little collection of verse was privately printed in 1896
4968,THE MASTER MARINER,and the following year marked the appearance of his first
4969,THE MASTER MARINER,"representative work, _The Children of the Night_ (1897)."
4970,THE MASTER MARINER,
4971,THE MASTER MARINER,"Somewhat later, he was struggling in various capacities to make a"
4972,THE MASTER MARINER,"living in New York, five years passing before the publication of"
4973,THE MASTER MARINER,"_Captain Craig_ (1902). This fine piece of psychology, in the"
4974,THE MASTER MARINER,"cryptic vein of Browning but in Robinson’s own idiom, was brought to"
4975,THE MASTER MARINER,the attention of Theodore Roosevelt (then President of the United
4976,THE MASTER MARINER,"States), who became interested in the work of the poet and, a few"
4977,THE MASTER MARINER,"years later, offered him a place in the New York Custom House."
4978,THE MASTER MARINER,"Robinson held this position from 1905 to 1910, leaving it the same"
4979,THE MASTER MARINER,"year which marked the appearance of his most characteristic volume,"
4980,THE MASTER MARINER,"_The Town down the River_. Robinson’s three books, up to this time,"
4981,THE MASTER MARINER,"showed his clean, firmly-drawn quality; but, in spite of their"
4982,THE MASTER MARINER,"excellences, they seem little more than a succession of preludes for"
4983,THE MASTER MARINER,the dynamic volume that was to establish him in the first rank of
4984,THE MASTER MARINER,"American poets. _The Man Against the Sky_, Robinson’s fullest and"
4985,THE MASTER MARINER,"most penetrating work, appeared in 1916. (See Preface.)"
4986,THE MASTER MARINER,
4987,THE MASTER MARINER,"In all of these books there is manifest that searching for truth,"
4988,THE MASTER MARINER,"the constant questioning, that takes the place of mere acceptance."
4989,THE MASTER MARINER,"As the work of a verbal portrait painter nothing, with the exception"
4990,THE MASTER MARINER,"of some of Frost’s pictures, has been produced that is at once so"
4991,THE MASTER MARINER,"keen and so kindly; in the half-cynical, half-mystical etchings like"
4992,THE MASTER MARINER,"“Cliff Klingenhagen,” “Miniver Cheevy,” “Richard Cory”—lines where"
4993,THE MASTER MARINER,Robinson’s irony is inextricably mixed with tenderness—his art is at
4994,THE MASTER MARINER,its height.
4995,THE MASTER MARINER,
4996,THE MASTER MARINER,"Technically, Robinson is as precise as he is dexterous; there is"
4997,THE MASTER MARINER,"never a false image or a blurred line in any of his verses which,"
4998,THE MASTER MARINER,while adhering to the strictest models and executed according to
4999,THE MASTER MARINER,"traditional forms, are made fresh and surprising. It is interesting"
5000,THE MASTER MARINER,"to observe how the smoothness of his rhymes, playing against the"
5001,THE MASTER MARINER,"hard outlines of his verse, emphasizes the terse, epigrammatic vigor"
5002,THE MASTER MARINER,"of poems like “The Gift of God,” “The Field of Glory” and “The"
5003,THE MASTER MARINER,"Master,” one of the finest evocations of Lincoln which is, at the"
5004,THE MASTER MARINER,"same time, a bitter commentary on the commercialism of the times and"
5005,THE MASTER MARINER,the “shopman’s test of age and worth.”
5006,THE MASTER MARINER,
5007,THE MASTER MARINER,"Robinson’s blank verse is scarcely less individual. It is, in spite"
5008,THE MASTER MARINER,"of a certain unblinking seriousness, always modern, always packed"
5009,THE MASTER MARINER,with the instant. In “Ben Johnson Entertains a Man from Stratford”
5010,THE MASTER MARINER,we have the clearest and most human portrait of Shakespeare ever
5011,THE MASTER MARINER,"attempted; the lines run as fluently as good conversation, as"
5012,THE MASTER MARINER,inevitable as a perfect melody. In his two reanimations of the
5013,THE MASTER MARINER,"Arthurian legends, _Merlin_ (1917) and _Launcelot_ (1920), Robinson,"
5014,THE MASTER MARINER,"shaming the tea-table idyls of Tennyson, has colored the tale with"
5015,THE MASTER MARINER,"somber reflections of the collapse of old orders, the darkness of an"
5016,THE MASTER MARINER,age in ashes.
5017,THE MASTER MARINER,
5018,THE MASTER MARINER,Although he is often accused of holding a negative attitude toward
5019,THE MASTER MARINER,"life, Robinson’s philosophy is essentially positive; a dogged if"
5020,THE MASTER MARINER,"never dogmatic desire for a deeper faith, a greater light. It is a"
5021,THE MASTER MARINER,philosophy expressed in _Captain Craig_:
5022,THE MASTER MARINER,
5023,THE MASTER MARINER,... Take on yourself
5024,THE MASTER MARINER,"But your sincerity, and you take on"
5025,THE MASTER MARINER,Good promise for all climbing; fly for truth
5026,THE MASTER MARINER,"And hell shall have no storm to crush your flight,"
5027,THE MASTER MARINER,No laughter to vex down your loyalty.
5028,THE MASTER MARINER,
5029,THE MASTER MARINER,"A collection of the poet’s later verse, _The Three Taverns_ (1920),"
5030,THE MASTER MARINER,reflects the same high standards of conciseness and craftsmanship.
5031,THE MASTER MARINER,"Robinson lives in Peterboro, New Hampshire, during the summer; his"
5032,THE MASTER MARINER,"home in the winter is in Brooklyn, New York."

5099,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],She fears a little for so much
5100,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"Of what is best, and hardly dares"
5101,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],To think of him as one to touch
5102,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"With aches, indignities, and cares;"
5103,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"She sees him rather at the goal,"
5104,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],Still shining; and her dream foretells
5105,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],The proper shining of a soul
5106,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],Where nothing ordinary dwells.
5107,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],
5108,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],Perchance a canvass of the town
5109,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"Would find him far from flags and shouts,"
5110,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],And leave him only the renown
5111,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],Of many smiles and many doubts;
5112,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],Perchance the crude and common tongue
5113,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],Would havoc strangely with his worth;
5114,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"But she, with innocence unwrung,"
5115,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],Would read his name around the earth.
5116,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],
5117,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"And others, knowing how this youth"
5118,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"Would shine, if love could make him great,"
5119,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],When caught and tortured for the truth
5120,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],Would only writhe and hesitate;
5121,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"While she, arranging for his days"
5122,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"What centuries could not fulfil,"
5123,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"Transmutes him with her faith and praise,"
5124,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],And has him shining where she will.
5125,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],
5126,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"She crowns him with her gratefulness,"
5127,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],And says again that life is good;
5128,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],And should the gift of God be less
5129,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"In him than in her motherhood,"
5130,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"His fame, though vague, will not be small,"
5131,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],"As upward through her dream he fares,"
5132,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],Half clouded with a crimson fall
5133,THE GIFT OF GOD[18],Of roses thrown on marble stairs.

5143,THE MASTER[19][20],"But soon the name was everywhere,"
5144,THE MASTER[19][20],To be reviled and then revered:

5146,THE MASTER[19][20],"We cannot hide it, or deny"
5147,THE MASTER[19][20],"That we, the gentlemen who jeered,"

5149,THE MASTER[19][20],
5150,THE MASTER[19][20],He came when days were perilous
5151,THE MASTER[19][20],And hearts of men were sore beguiled;
5152,THE MASTER[19][20],"And having made his note of us,"
5153,THE MASTER[19][20],He pondered and was reconciled.
5154,THE MASTER[19][20],Was ever master yet so mild
5155,THE MASTER[19][20],"As he, and so untamable?"
5156,THE MASTER[19][20],"We doubted, even when he smiled,"
5157,THE MASTER[19][20],Not knowing what he knew so well.
5158,THE MASTER[19][20],
5159,THE MASTER[19][20],He knew that undeceiving fate
5160,THE MASTER[19][20],Would shame us whom he served unsought;
5161,THE MASTER[19][20],He knew that he must wince and wait—
5162,THE MASTER[19][20],The jest of those for whom he fought;
5163,THE MASTER[19][20],He knew devoutly what he thought
5164,THE MASTER[19][20],Of us and of our ridicule;
5165,THE MASTER[19][20],He knew that we must all be taught
5166,THE MASTER[19][20],Like little children in a school.
5167,THE MASTER[19][20],
5168,THE MASTER[19][20],We gave a glamour to the task
5169,THE MASTER[19][20],"That he encountered and saw through,"
5170,THE MASTER[19][20],"But little of us did he ask,"
5171,THE MASTER[19][20],And little did we ever do.
5172,THE MASTER[19][20],And what appears if we review
5173,THE MASTER[19][20],The season when we railed and chaffed?
5174,THE MASTER[19][20],It is the face of one who knew
5175,THE MASTER[19][20],That we were learning while we laughed.
5176,THE MASTER[19][20],
5177,THE MASTER[19][20],The face that in our vision feels
5178,THE MASTER[19][20],"Again the venom that we flung,"
5179,THE MASTER[19][20],Transfigured to the world reveals
5180,THE MASTER[19][20],The vigilance to which we clung.
5181,THE MASTER[19][20],"Shrewd, hallowed, harassed, and among"
5182,THE MASTER[19][20],"The mysteries that are untold,"
5183,THE MASTER[19][20],"The face we see was never young,"
5184,THE MASTER[19][20],Nor could it ever have been old.
5185,THE MASTER[19][20],
5186,THE MASTER[19][20],"For he, to whom we have applied"
5187,THE MASTER[19][20],"Our shopman’s test of age and worth,"
5188,THE MASTER[19][20],"Was elemental when he died,"
5189,THE MASTER[19][20],As he was ancient at his birth:
5190,THE MASTER[19][20],"The saddest among kings of earth,"
5191,THE MASTER[19][20],"Bowed with a galling crown, this man"
5192,THE MASTER[19][20],"Met rancor with a cryptic mirth,"
5193,THE MASTER[19][20],Laconic—and Olympian.
5194,THE MASTER[19][20],
5195,THE MASTER[19][20],"The love, the grandeur, and the fame"
5196,THE MASTER[19][20],Are bounded by the world alone;
5197,THE MASTER[19][20],"The calm, the smouldering, and the flame"
5198,THE MASTER[19][20],Of awful patience were his own:
5199,THE MASTER[19][20],With him they are forever flown
5200,THE MASTER[19][20],"Past all our fond self-shadowings,"
5201,THE MASTER[19][20],Wherewith we cumber the Unknown
5202,THE MASTER[19][20],As with inept Icarian wings.
5203,THE MASTER[19][20],
5204,THE MASTER[19][20],For we were not as other men:
5205,THE MASTER[19][20],’Twas ours to soar and his to see.
5206,THE MASTER[19][20],"But we are coming down again,"
5207,THE MASTER[19][20],And we shall come down pleasantly;
5208,THE MASTER[19][20],Nor shall we longer disagree
5209,THE MASTER[19][20],"On what it is to be sublime,"
5210,THE MASTER[19][20],But flourish in our perigee
5211,THE MASTER[19][20],And have one Titan at a time.

5287,THE DARK HILLS,
5288,THE DARK HILLS,
5289,THE DARK HILLS,_Edgar Lee Masters_
5290,THE DARK HILLS,
5291,THE DARK HILLS,
5292,THE DARK HILLS,"Edgar Lee Masters was born at Garnett, Kansas, August 23, 1869, of"
5293,THE DARK HILLS,"old Puritan and pioneering stock. When he was still a boy, the"
5294,THE DARK HILLS,"family moved to Illinois, where, after desultory schooling, he"
5295,THE DARK HILLS,studied law in his father’s office at Lewiston. For a year he
5296,THE DARK HILLS,"practised with his father and then went to Chicago, where he became"
5297,THE DARK HILLS,a successful and prominent attorney.
5298,THE DARK HILLS,
5299,THE DARK HILLS,"Before going to Chicago, Masters had composed a great quantity of"
5300,THE DARK HILLS,verse in traditional forms on still more traditional themes; by the
5301,THE DARK HILLS,"time he was twenty-four he had written about four hundred poems,"
5302,THE DARK HILLS,revealing the result of wide reading and betraying the influence of
5303,THE DARK HILLS,"Poe, Keats, Shelley and Swinburne. His work, previous to the"
5304,THE DARK HILLS,"publication of _Spoon River Anthology_, was derivative and"
5305,THE DARK HILLS,undistinguished. In 1895 he wrote a blank verse play on Benedict
5306,THE DARK HILLS,"Arnold. In 1898 he published _A Book of Verses_, a selection of some"
5307,THE DARK HILLS,"sixty of the early four hundred. In 1902 _Maximilian_, another blank"
5308,THE DARK HILLS,"verse play, appeared, causing no more comment than the others."
5309,THE DARK HILLS,"Nothing daunted, Masters published several volumes in rapid"
5310,THE DARK HILLS,"succession (three books of poetry appearing, under various"
5311,THE DARK HILLS,"pseudonyms, between 1905 and 1912), _The New Star Chamber and Other"
5312,THE DARK HILLS,"Essays_ (1904), _Blood of the Prophets_ (1905), _Althea_, a play"
5313,THE DARK HILLS,"(1907), _The Trifler_, another play (1908)."
5314,THE DARK HILLS,
5315,THE DARK HILLS,"In 1914, Masters, at the suggestion of his friend William Marion"
5316,THE DARK HILLS,"Reedy, turned from his preoccupation with classic subjects and began"
5317,THE DARK HILLS,to draw upon the life he knew for those concise records which have
5318,THE DARK HILLS,"made him famous. Taking as his model _The Greek Anthology_, which"
5319,THE DARK HILLS,"Reedy had pressed upon him, Masters evolved _Spoon River Anthology_,"
5320,THE DARK HILLS,that astonishing assemblage of over two hundred self-inscribed
5321,THE DARK HILLS,"epitaphs, in which the dead of a middle Western town are supposed to"
5322,THE DARK HILLS,have written the truth about themselves. Through these frank
5323,THE DARK HILLS,"revelations, many of them interrelated, the village is recreated for"
5324,THE DARK HILLS,"us; it lives again, unvarnished and typical, with all its intrigues,"
5325,THE DARK HILLS,"hypocrisies, feuds, martyrdoms and occasional exaltations. The"
5326,THE DARK HILLS,"crippling monotony of existence in a drab township, the defeat of"
5327,THE DARK HILLS,"ideals, the struggle toward higher goals—all is synthesized in these"
5328,THE DARK HILLS,crowded pages. All moods and all manner of voices are heard
5329,THE DARK HILLS,"here—even Masters’s, who explains the reason for his medium and the"
5330,THE DARK HILLS,"selection of his form through “Petit, the Poet.”"
5331,THE DARK HILLS,
5332,THE DARK HILLS,The success of the volume was stupendous. (See Preface.) With every
5333,THE DARK HILLS,new attack (and its frankness continued to make fresh enemies) its
5334,THE DARK HILLS,"readers increased; it was imitated, parodied, reviled as “a piece of"
5335,THE DARK HILLS,yellow journalism;” hailed as “an American Comédie Humaine.”
5336,THE DARK HILLS,"Finally, after the storm of controversy, it has taken its place as a"
5337,THE DARK HILLS,landmark in American literature.
5338,THE DARK HILLS,
5339,THE DARK HILLS,With _Spoon River Anthology_ Masters arrived—and left. He went back
5340,THE DARK HILLS,"to his first rhetorical style, resurrecting many of his earlier"
5341,THE DARK HILLS,"trifles, reprinting dull echoes of Tennyson, imitations of Shelley,"
5342,THE DARK HILLS,"archaic paraphrases in the manner of Swinburne. Yet, though none of"
5343,THE DARK HILLS,"Masters’s subsequent volumes can be compared to his masterpiece, all"
5344,THE DARK HILLS,"of them contain examples of the same straightforwardness, the"
5345,THE DARK HILLS,stubborn searching for truth that intensified his best known
5346,THE DARK HILLS,characterizations.
5347,THE DARK HILLS,
5348,THE DARK HILLS,_Songs and Satires_ (1916) contains the startling “All Life in a
5349,THE DARK HILLS,Life” and the gravely moving “Silence.” _The Great Valley_ (1916) is
5350,THE DARK HILLS,packed with echoes and a growing dependence on Browning. In _Toward
5351,THE DARK HILLS,"the Gulf_ (1918), the Browning influence predominates, although"
5352,THE DARK HILLS,"there are such splendid individual monologues as “The World Saver,”"
5353,THE DARK HILLS,“St. Deseret” and “Front the Ages with a Smile.” _Starved Rock_
5354,THE DARK HILLS,"(1919) and _Domesday Book_ (1920) are, like all Masters’s later"
5355,THE DARK HILLS,"books, queerly assembled mixtures of good, bad and derivative verse."
5356,THE DARK HILLS,"And yet, for all of this poet’s borrowings, in spite of his cynicism"
5357,THE DARK HILLS,"and disillusion, Masters’s work is a continual searching for some"
5358,THE DARK HILLS,"key to the mystery of truth, the mastery of life."

5451,SILENCE[26],"The flashes of guns, the thunder of cannon,"
5452,SILENCE[26],"The shrieks of the slain,"
5453,SILENCE[26],"And himself lying on the ground,"
5454,SILENCE[26],"And the hospital surgeons, the knives,"

5456,SILENCE[26],But if he could describe it all
5457,SILENCE[26],He would be an artist.

5460,SILENCE[26],"There is the silence of a great hatred,"

5463,SILENCE[26],"And the silence of an embittered friendship,"
5464,SILENCE[26],"There is the silence of a spiritual crisis,"
5465,SILENCE[26],"Through which your soul, exquisitely tortured,"
5466,SILENCE[26],Comes with visions not to be uttered
5467,SILENCE[26],Into a realm of higher life.
5468,SILENCE[26],"And the silence of the gods who understand each other without speech,"
5469,SILENCE[26],There is the silence of defeat.
5470,SILENCE[26],There is the silence of those unjustly punished;
5471,SILENCE[26],And the silence of the dying whose hand
5472,SILENCE[26],Suddenly grips yours.
5473,SILENCE[26],"There is the silence between father and son,"
5474,SILENCE[26],"When the father cannot explain his life,"
5475,SILENCE[26],Even though he be misunderstood for it.
5476,SILENCE[26],
5477,SILENCE[26],There is the silence that comes between husband and wife.
5478,SILENCE[26],There is the silence of those who have failed;
5479,SILENCE[26],And the vast silence that covers
5480,SILENCE[26],Broken nations and vanquished leaders.
5481,SILENCE[26],"There is the silence of Lincoln,"
5482,SILENCE[26],Thinking of the poverty of his youth.
5483,SILENCE[26],And the silence of Napoleon
5484,SILENCE[26],After Waterloo.
5485,SILENCE[26],And the silence of Jeanne d’Arc
5486,SILENCE[26],"Saying amid the flames, “Blesséd Jesus”—"
5487,SILENCE[26],"Revealing in two words all sorrow, all hope."
5488,SILENCE[26],"And there is the silence of age,"
5489,SILENCE[26],Too full of wisdom for the tongue to utter it
5490,SILENCE[26],In words intelligible to those who have not lived
5491,SILENCE[26],The great range of life.
5492,SILENCE[26],
5493,SILENCE[26],And there is the silence of the dead.
5494,SILENCE[26],If we who are in life cannot speak
5495,SILENCE[26],"Of profound experiences,"
5496,SILENCE[26],Why do you marvel that the dead
5497,SILENCE[26],Do not tell you of death?
5498,SILENCE[26],Their silence shall be interpreted
5499,SILENCE[26],As we approach them.

5504,SILENCE[26],_Stephen Crane_
5505,SILENCE[26],
5506,SILENCE[26],
5507,SILENCE[26],"Stephen Crane, whose literary career was one of the most meteoric in"
5508,SILENCE[26],"American letters, was born at Newark, New Jersey, November 1, 1871."
5509,SILENCE[26],"After taking a partial course at Lafayette College, he entered"
5510,SILENCE[26],"journalism at sixteen and, until the time of his death, was a"
5511,SILENCE[26],"reporter and writer of newspaper sketches. When he died, at the age"
5512,SILENCE[26],"of thirty, he had ten printed volumes standing to his credit, two"
5513,SILENCE[26],"more announced for publication, and two others which were appearing"
5514,SILENCE[26],serially.
5515,SILENCE[26],
5516,SILENCE[26],"Crane’s most famous novel, _The Red Badge of Courage_ (1895), was"
5517,SILENCE[26],written when he was twenty-two years old. What is even more
5518,SILENCE[26],astonishing is the fact that this detailed description of blood and
5519,SILENCE[26],battlefields was written by a civilian far from the scene of
5520,SILENCE[26],conflict. This novel (Crane’s second) was an instantaneous and
5521,SILENCE[26],international success. _The Atlantic Monthly_ pronounced it “great
5522,SILENCE[26],"enough to set a new fashion in literature”; H. G. Wells, speaking of"
5523,SILENCE[26],"its influence in England, said Crane was “the first expression of"
5524,SILENCE[26],the opening mind or a new period ... a record of an intensity beyond
5525,SILENCE[26],all precedent.”
5526,SILENCE[26],
5527,SILENCE[26],"Crane’s other books, although less powerful than _The Red Badge of"
5528,SILENCE[26],"Courage_, are scarcely less vivid. _The Open Boat_ (1898) and _The"
5529,SILENCE[26],Monster_ (1899) are full of an intuitive wisdom and a sensitivity
5530,SILENCE[26],that caused Wells to exclaim “The man who can call these ‘brilliant
5531,SILENCE[26],fragments’ would reproach Rodin for not ‘completing’ his fragments.”
5532,SILENCE[26],
5533,SILENCE[26],"At various periods in Crane’s brief career, he experimented in"
5534,SILENCE[26],"verse, seeking to find new effects in unrhymed lines, a new"
5535,SILENCE[26],acuteness of vision. The results were embodied in two volumes of
5536,SILENCE[26],"unusual poetry, _The Black Riders_ (1895) and _War Is Kind_ (1899),"
5537,SILENCE[26],lines that strangely anticipated the Imagists and the epigrammatic
5538,SILENCE[26],free verse that followed fifteen years later.
5539,SILENCE[26],
5540,SILENCE[26],"Besides his many novels, short stories and poems, Crane was writing,"
5541,SILENCE[26],"at the time of his death, descriptions of the world’s great battles"
5542,SILENCE[26],for _Lippincott’s Magazine_; his droll _Whilomville Stories_ for
5543,SILENCE[26],boys were appearing in _Harper’s Monthly_ and he was beginning a
5544,SILENCE[26],series of similar stories for girls. It is more than probable that
5545,SILENCE[26],this feverish energy of production aggravated the illness that
5546,SILENCE[26],caused Crane’s death. He reached his refuge in the Black Forest only
5547,SILENCE[26],"to die at the journey’s end, June 5, 1900."

5620,THE BLADES OF GRASS,_Edwin Ford Piper_
5621,THE BLADES OF GRASS,
5622,THE BLADES OF GRASS,
5623,THE BLADES OF GRASS,"Edwin Ford Piper was born at Auburn, Nebraska, February 8, 1871, and"
5624,THE BLADES OF GRASS,literally grew up in the saddle. In 1893 he entered the University
5625,THE BLADES OF GRASS,"of Nebraska, from which he received an A.B. in 1897 and A.M. in"
5626,THE BLADES OF GRASS,"1900. He studied at Harvard (1903–4), was one of the editors of _The"
5627,THE BLADES OF GRASS,"Kiote_ (a magazine published from 1898 to 1902 in Lincoln,"
5628,THE BLADES OF GRASS,"Nebraska), and, since 1905, has been an instructor of English at the"
5629,THE BLADES OF GRASS,State University of Iowa.
5630,THE BLADES OF GRASS,
5631,THE BLADES OF GRASS,_Piper’s Barbed Wire and Other Poems_ (1918) is saturated with the
5632,THE BLADES OF GRASS,color of his environment. His later poems are still more vivid and
5633,THE BLADES OF GRASS,racy. “Sweetgrass Range” (with its self-acknowledged debt to Burns’s
5634,THE BLADES OF GRASS,“Rattlin’ Roarin’ Willie”) and “Bindlestiff” are fresh evidences of
5635,THE BLADES OF GRASS,this author’s creative interest in ballads and folk-lore.

5644,BINDLESTIFF,
5645,BINDLESTIFF,At dawn the hedges and the wheel-ruts ran
5646,BINDLESTIFF,Into a brightening sky. The grass bent low
5647,BINDLESTIFF,"With shimmering dew, and many a late wild rose"
5648,BINDLESTIFF,Unrolled the petals from its odorous heart
5649,BINDLESTIFF,"While birds held tuneful gossip. Suddenly,"
5650,BINDLESTIFF,Each bubbling trill and whistle hid away
5651,BINDLESTIFF,As from a hawk; the fragrant silence heard
5652,BINDLESTIFF,Only the loving stir of little leaves;
5653,BINDLESTIFF,Then a man’s baritone broke roughly in:
5654,BINDLESTIFF,
5655,BINDLESTIFF,"_I’ve gnawed my crust of mouldy bread,"
5656,BINDLESTIFF,Skimmed my mulligan stew;
5657,BINDLESTIFF,Laid beneath the barren hedge—
5658,BINDLESTIFF,Sleety night-winds blew._
5659,BINDLESTIFF,
5660,BINDLESTIFF,"_Slanting rain chills my bones,"
5661,BINDLESTIFF,Sun bakes my skin;
5662,BINDLESTIFF,"Rocky road for my limping feet,"
5663,BINDLESTIFF,Door where I can’t go in._
5664,BINDLESTIFF,
5665,BINDLESTIFF,Above the hedgerow floated filmy smoke
5666,BINDLESTIFF,From the hidden singer’s fire. Once more the voice:
5667,BINDLESTIFF,
5668,BINDLESTIFF,_I used to burn the mules with the whip
5669,BINDLESTIFF,When I worked on the grading gang;
5670,BINDLESTIFF,"But the boss was a crook, and he docked my pay—"

5677,BINDLESTIFF,
5678,BINDLESTIFF,"The mesh of leafy branches rustled loud,"
5679,BINDLESTIFF,Into the road slid Bindlestiff. You’ve seen
5680,BINDLESTIFF,The like of the traveller: gaunt humanity
5681,BINDLESTIFF,"In stained and broken coat, with untrimmed hedge"
5682,BINDLESTIFF,Of rusty beard and curling sunburnt hair;
5683,BINDLESTIFF,"His hat, once white, a dull uncertain cone;"
5684,BINDLESTIFF,"His leathery hands and cheeks, his bright blue eyes"
5685,BINDLESTIFF,That always see new faces and strange dogs;
5686,BINDLESTIFF,His mouth that laughs at life and at himself.
5687,BINDLESTIFF,
5688,BINDLESTIFF,_Sometimes they shut you up in jail—
5689,BINDLESTIFF,"Dark, and a filthy cell;"
5690,BINDLESTIFF,I hope the fellows built them jails

5694,BINDLESTIFF,Feed you like a king;

5697,BINDLESTIFF,
5698,BINDLESTIFF,"The tones came mellower, as unevenly"
5699,BINDLESTIFF,The tramp limped off trailing the hobo song:
5700,BINDLESTIFF,
5701,BINDLESTIFF,"_Good-bye, farewell to Omaha,"
5702,BINDLESTIFF,"K. C., and Denver, too;"
5703,BINDLESTIFF,"Put my foot on the flying freight,"
5704,BINDLESTIFF,Going to ride her through._
5705,BINDLESTIFF,
5706,BINDLESTIFF,"Bindlestiff topped a hillock, against the sky"
5707,BINDLESTIFF,Showed stick and bundle with his extra shoes
5708,BINDLESTIFF,Jauntily dangling. Bird to bird once more
5709,BINDLESTIFF,Made low sweet answer; in the wild rose cups
5710,BINDLESTIFF,The bee found yellow meal; all softly moved
5711,BINDLESTIFF,The white and purple morning-glory bells
5712,BINDLESTIFF,As on the gently rustling hedgetop leaves
5713,BINDLESTIFF,The sun’s face rested. Bindlestiff was gone.

5754,SWEETGRASS RANGE,"Thomas Augustine Daly was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, May"
5755,SWEETGRASS RANGE,"28, 1871. He attended Villanova College and Fordham University"
5756,SWEETGRASS RANGE,"(1889), leaving there at the end of his sophomore year to become a"
5757,SWEETGRASS RANGE,newspaper man. Since 1891 he has been on the staff of various
5758,SWEETGRASS RANGE,"Philadelphia journals, writing reviews, editorials, travel-notes"
5759,SWEETGRASS RANGE,"and, most of all, running the columns in which his much-quoted verse"

5761,SWEETGRASS RANGE,
5762,SWEETGRASS RANGE,_Canzoni_ (1906) and _Carmina_ (1909) contain the best known of
5763,SWEETGRASS RANGE,Daly’s varied dialect verse. Although he has written in half a dozen
5764,SWEETGRASS RANGE,different idioms including “straight” English (_vide Songs of
5765,SWEETGRASS RANGE,"Wedlock_, 1916), his half-humorous, half-pathetic interpretations of"

5768,SWEETGRASS RANGE,"Seldom descending to caricature, Daly exhibits the features and"

5880,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,_Paul Laurence Dunbar_
5881,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,
5882,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,
5883,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"Paul Laurence Dunbar was born in 1872 at Dayton, Ohio, the son of"
5884,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"negro slaves. He was, before and after he began to write his"
5885,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"interpretative verse, an elevator-boy. He tried newspaper work"
5886,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"unsuccessfully and, in 1899, Dunbar was given a minor position in"
5887,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"the Library of Congress at Washington, D. C."
5888,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,
5889,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,Although Dunbar wrote several volumes of short stories and two
5890,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"novels, he is most at home in his verse. And even here, his best"
5891,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"work is not those straight, “literary English” pieces by which he"
5892,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"set such store, but the racy rhymes written in negro dialect,"
5893,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"alternately tender and mocking. Dunbar’s first collection, _Lyrics"
5894,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"of Lowly Life_ (1896), contains many of his most characteristic"
5895,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"poems. In an introduction, in which mention was made of the octoroon"
5896,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"Dumas and the great Russian poet Pushkin, who was a mulatto, William"
5897,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"Dean Howells wrote, “So far as I could remember, Paul Dunbar was the"
5898,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,only man of pure African blood and of American civilization to feel
5899,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,the negro life æsthetically and express it lyrically.... His
5900,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,brilliant and unique achievement was to have studied the American
5901,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"negro objectively, and to have represented him as he found him—with"
5902,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"humor, with sympathy, and yet with what the reader must"
5903,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,instinctively feel to be entire truthfulness.”
5904,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,
5905,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,_Lyrics of the Hearthside_ (1899) and _Lyrics of Love and Laughter_
5906,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,(1903) are two other volumes full of folk-stuff. And though the
5907,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"final _Lyrics of Sunshine and Shadow_ (1905) is less original, being"
5908,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,crowded with echoes of all kinds of poetry from the songs of Robert
5909,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,"Burns to the childhood rhymes of J. W. Riley, it contains a few of"
5910,BETWEEN TWO LOVES,Dunbar’s least-known but keenest interpretations.

6134,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,"A rooster that is bound to crow,"
6135,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,A crow that’s bound to roost;
6136,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,And whichsoever he espies
6137,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,He tells the most unblushing lies.
6138,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,
6139,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,"“Sweet fowl,” he said, “I understand"
6140,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,"You’re more than merely natty,"
6141,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,I hear you sing to beat the band
6142,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,And Adelina Patti.
6143,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,Pray render with your liquid tongue
6144,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,A bit from ‘Götterdämmerung.’”
6145,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,
6146,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,This subtle speech was aimed to please
6147,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,"The crow, and it succeeded;"
6148,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,He thought no bird in all the trees
6149,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,Could sing as well as he did.
6150,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,"In flattery completely doused,"
6151,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,He gave the “Jewel Song” from “Faust.”
6152,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,"But gravitation’s law, of course,"
6153,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,"As Isaac Newton showed it,"
6154,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,"Exerted on the cheese its force,"
6155,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,And elsewhere soon bestowed it.
6156,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,"In fact, there is no need to tell"
6157,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,What happened when to earth it fell.
6158,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,
6159,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,I blush to add that when the bird
6160,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,Took in the situation
6161,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,"He said one brief, emphatic word,"
6162,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,Unfit for publication.
6163,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,"The fox was greatly startled, but"
6164,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,He only sighed and answered “Tut.”
6165,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,
6166,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,THE MORAL is: A fox is bound
6167,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,To be a shameless sinner.
6168,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,And also: When the cheese comes round
6169,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,You know it’s after dinner.
6170,THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN,But (what is only known to few)

6202,HOW A CAT WAS ANNOYED AND A POET WAS BOOTED,"By advising, do him good."
6203,HOW A CAT WAS ANNOYED AND A POET WAS BOOTED,So addressed him in a manner that was terse:

6230,HOW A CAT WAS ANNOYED AND A POET WAS BOOTED,
6231,HOW A CAT WAS ANNOYED AND A POET WAS BOOTED,She was jarred and very sore

6245,HOW A CAT WAS ANNOYED AND A POET WAS BOOTED,“There is one thing I can do!”

6283,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,
6284,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"Out in the desert spaces, edged by a hazy blue,"
6285,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,Davison sought the faces of the long-lost friends he knew:
6286,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"They were there, in the distance dreaming"
6287,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,Their dreams that were worn and old;
6288,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"They were there, to his frenzied seeming,"
6289,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,Still burrowing down for gold.
6290,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,
6291,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"Davison’s face was leather; his mouth was a swollen blot,"
6292,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"His mind was a floating feather, in The Valley That God Forgot;"
6293,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"Wild as a dog gone loco,"
6294,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"Or sullen or meek, by turns,"
6295,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,He mumbled a “Poco! Poco!”
6296,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,And whispered of pools and ferns.
6297,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,
6298,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"Gold! Why his, for the finding! But water was never found,"
6299,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,Save in deep caverns winding miles through the underground:
6300,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"Cool, far, shadowy places"
6301,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"Edged by the mirrored trees,"
6302,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,When—Davison saw the faces!
6303,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,And fear let loose his knees.
6304,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,
6305,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"There was Shorty who owed him money, and Billing who bossed the crowd;"

6310,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"And offered him gold, in pay."
6311,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,
6312,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,Gold? It was never cheaper. And Davison shook his head:
6313,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"“The price of a drink is steeper out here than in town,” he said."
6314,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,He laughed as they mouthed and muttered
6315,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,Through lips that were cracked and dried;
6316,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,The pulse in his ear-drum fluttered:
6317,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,“I’m through with the game!” he cried.
6318,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,
6319,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,“I’m through!” And he knelt and fumbled the cap of his dry canteen
6320,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"Then, rising, he swayed and stumbled into a black ravine:"
6321,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"His ghostly comrades followed,"
6322,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"For Davison’s end was near,"

6332,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,
6333,THE VALLEY THAT GOD FORGOT,"Called it, The Morning-Glory—near those abandoned stamps,"

6410,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,
6411,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,Berries of the saskatoon were ripening and falling;

6449,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,"Anna Hempstead Branch was born at New London, Connecticut. She"
6450,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,graduated from Smith College in 1897 and has devoted herself to

6453,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,"Her two chief volumes, _The Shoes That Danced_ (1905) and _Rose of"
6454,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,"the Wind_ (1910), show a singer who is less fanciful than"
6455,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,"philosophic. Often, indeed, she weighs down her simple melodies with"
6456,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,"a heavy intellectuality, but, even more often, she attains a high"
6457,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,"level of lyricism. Her lines are admirably condensed, rich in"
6458,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,personal value as well as poetic revelation; they maintain a high
6459,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,"and austere level. A typical poem is “The Monk in the Kitchen,”"
6460,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,"which, with its spiritual loveliness and verbal felicity, is a"
6461,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,celebration of cleanness that gives order an almost mystical
6462,THE TRAIL-MAKERS,nobility.

6621,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,_Amy Lowell_
6622,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,
6623,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,
6624,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"Amy Lowell was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, February 9, 1874,"
6625,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"of a long line of noted publicists and poets, the first colonist (a"
6626,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,Percival Lowell) arriving in Newburyport in 1637. James Russell
6627,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"Lowell was a cousin of her grandfather; Abbott Lawrence, her"
6628,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"mother’s father, was minister to England; and Abbott Lawrence"
6629,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"Lowell, her brother, is president of Harvard University."
6630,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,
6631,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,Miss Lowell obtained her early education through private tuition and
6632,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,travel abroad. These European journeys were the background upon
6633,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,which much of Miss Lowell’s later work is unconsciously woven; her
6634,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"visits to France, Egypt, Turkey and Greece bore fruit, many years"
6635,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"later, in the exotic colors of her verse. As a young girl, she had"
6636,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"vague aspirations toward being a writer; but it was not until 1902,"
6637,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"when she was twenty-eight years old, that she definitely determined"
6638,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,to be a poet. For eight years she served a rigorous and solitary
6639,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"apprenticeship, reading the classics of all schools and countries,"
6640,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"studying the technique of verse, exercising her verbal power—but"
6641,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,never attempting to publish a single line. In 1910 her first verse
6642,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,was printed in _The Atlantic Monthly_; two years later her first
6643,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,book appeared.
6644,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,
6645,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"This volume, _A Dome of Many-colored Glass_ (1912), was a strangely"
6646,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,unpromising first book. The subjects were as conventional as the
6647,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,treatment of them; the influence of Keats and Tennyson was evident;
6648,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"the tone was soft and sentimental, almost without a trace of"
6649,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,personality. It was a queer prologue to the vivid _Sword Blades and
6650,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"Poppy Seed_ (1914), which marked not only an extraordinary advance"
6651,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,but a totally new individuality. This second volume contained many
6652,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"distinctive poems written in the usual forms, a score of pictorial"
6653,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,pieces illustrating Miss Lowell’s identification with the Imagists
6654,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"(see Preface) and, possibly most important from a technical"
6655,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"standpoint, the first appearance in English of “polyphonic prose.”"
6656,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"Of this extremely flexible form, which has only begun to be"
6657,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"exploited, Miss Lowell, in an essay on John Gould Fletcher, has"
6658,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"written, “‘Polyphonic’ means ‘many-voiced,’ and the form is"
6659,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"so-called because it makes use of the ‘voices’ of poetry, namely:"
6660,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"meter, _vers libre_, assonance, alliteration, rhyme and return. It"
6661,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"employs every form of rhythm, even prose rhythm at times.”"
6662,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,
6663,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,It was because of such experiments in form and technique that Miss
6664,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"Lowell first attracted attention and is still best known. But,"
6665,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"beneath her preoccupation with theories and novelty of utterance,"
6666,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"one listens to the skilled story-teller, to the designer of"
6667,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"arabesques, to the narrator who (_vide_ such poems as “A Lady,”"
6668,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,“Vintage” and the later “Bronze Horses”) revivifies history with
6669,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,creative excitement.
6670,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,
6671,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"_Men, Women and Ghosts_ (1916) brims with this contagious vitality;"
6672,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"it is richer in variety than its predecessors, swifter in movement,"
6673,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"surer in artistry. It is, in common with all of Miss Lowell’s work,"
6674,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,best in its portrayal of the colors and sounds of physical rather
6675,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"than the reactions of emotional experience. She is, preëminently,"
6676,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,the poet of the external world; her pictures are as “hard and clear”
6677,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,as the most uncompromising Imagist could desire. The colors with
6678,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,which her works are studded seem like bits of bright enamel; every
6679,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,leaf and flower has a lacquered brilliance. To compensate for the
6680,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"lack of personal warmth, Miss Lowell feverishly agitates all she"
6681,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,touches; nothing remains quiescent. Whether she writes about a fruit
6682,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"shop, or a flower-garden in Roxbury, or a window-full of red"
6683,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"slippers, or a string quartet, or a Japanese print—everything"
6684,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"flashes, leaps, startles, spins and burns with an almost savage"
6685,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,intensity; a dynamic speed dizzies one. Here motion frequently takes
6686,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,the place of emotion.
6687,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,
6688,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"In _Can Grande’s Castle_ (1918), Miss Lowell achieves a broader"
6689,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"line; the teller of stories, the bizarre decorator and the"
6690,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,experimentalist are finally fused. The poems in this volume are only
6691,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"four in number—four polyphonic prose poems of almost epic length,"
6692,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"but they are extraordinarily varied in music, sweeping in their"
6693,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,sense of magnitude and time. _Pictures of the Floating World_ (1919)
6694,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"which followed is, in many ways, Miss Lowell’s most personal"
6695,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,revelation. Although there are several pages devoted to the merely
6696,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"dazzling and grotesque, most of these poems are in a quieter key; a"
6697,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,new restraint gives unsuspected overtones to stanzas that have much
6698,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"in common with the earlier “Patterns” where the narrative, the"
6699,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,character and the thing observed are inextricably knit.
6700,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,
6701,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"Besides Miss Lowell’s original poetry, she has made many studies in"
6702,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"Japanese and Chinese poetry reflecting, even in her own work, their"
6703,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,Oriental colors and contours. She has also written two volumes of
6704,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,critical essays: _Six French Poets_ (1915) and _Tendencies in Modern
6705,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,"American Poetry_ (1917), both of them invaluable aids to the student"
6706,WHILE LOVELINESS GOES BY,of contemporary literature.

6881,WIND AND SILVER,_Ridgely Torrence_
6882,WIND AND SILVER,
6883,WIND AND SILVER,
6884,WIND AND SILVER,"(Frederic) Ridgely Torrence was born at Xenia, Ohio, November 27,"
6885,WIND AND SILVER,"1875, and was educated at Miami and Princeton University. For"
6886,WIND AND SILVER,several years he was librarian of the Astor Library in New York City
6887,WIND AND SILVER,(1897-1901) and has been on several editorial staffs since then.
6888,WIND AND SILVER,
6889,WIND AND SILVER,"His first volume, _The House of a Hundred Lights_ (1900), bears the"
6890,WIND AND SILVER,grave subtitle “A Psalm of Experience after Reading a Couplet of
6891,WIND AND SILVER,"Bidpai” and is a half-whimsical, half-searching hodge-podge of"
6892,WIND AND SILVER,"philosophy, love lyrics, artlessness and impudence. The influence of"
6893,WIND AND SILVER,Omar Khayyám and Richard Hovey is obvious but not too dominant;
6894,WIND AND SILVER,Torrence saves himself on the very verge of sentimentality and
6895,WIND AND SILVER,"rhetoric by a chuckle, an adroit right-about-face."
6896,WIND AND SILVER,
6897,WIND AND SILVER,"Torrence’s subsequent uncollected verses have a deeper force, a"
6898,WIND AND SILVER,more concentrated fire. In “The Bird and the Tree” and
6899,WIND AND SILVER,"“Eye-Witness,” he has caught something more than the colors of"
6900,WIND AND SILVER,certain localities—particularly of the dark belt. They are as
6901,WIND AND SILVER,"eloquent and moving as his _Granny Maumee and Other Plays_ (1917),"
6902,WIND AND SILVER,which owe their power not only to Torrence’s gift as a poet but to
6903,WIND AND SILVER,his sympathy as a folk-lyrist.

6984,THE SON,_Robert Frost_
6985,THE SON,
6986,THE SON,
6987,THE SON,"Although known as the chief interpreter of the new New England,"
6988,THE SON,"Robert (Lee) Frost was born in San Francisco, California, March 26,"
6989,THE SON,"1875. At the age of ten he came East to the towns and hills where,"
6990,THE SON,"for eight generations, his forefathers had lived. After graduating"
6991,THE SON,"from the high school at Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1892, Frost"
6992,THE SON,"entered Dartmouth College, where he remained only a few months. The"
6993,THE SON,"routine of study was too much for him and, determined to keep his"
6994,THE SON,"mind free for creative work, he decided to earn his living and"
6995,THE SON,became a bobbin boy in one of the mills at Lawrence. He had already
6996,THE SON,begun to write poetry; a few of his verses had appeared in _The
6997,THE SON,Independent_. But the strange soil-flavored quality which even then
6998,THE SON,"distinguished his lines was not relished by the editors, and the"
6999,THE SON,"very magazines to which he sent poems that today are famous,"
7000,THE SON,rejected his verse with amazing unanimity. For twenty years Frost
7001,THE SON,continued to write his highly characteristic work in spite of the
7002,THE SON,"discouraging apathy, and for twenty years the poet remained unknown."
7003,THE SON,
7004,THE SON,"In 1897, two years after his marriage, Frost moved his family to"
7005,THE SON,"Cambridge, Massachusetts, and entered Harvard in a final"
7006,THE SON,determination to achieve culture. This time he followed the
7007,THE SON,"cut-and-dried curriculum for two years, but at the end of that"
7008,THE SON,period he stopped trying to learn and started to teach. For three
7009,THE SON,"years he taught school, made shoes, edited a weekly paper, and in"
7010,THE SON,"1900 became a farmer at Derry, New Hampshire. During the next eleven"
7011,THE SON,years Frost labored to wrest a living from the stubborn rocky hills
7012,THE SON,with scant success. Loneliness claimed him for its own; the ground
7013,THE SON,refused to give him a living; the literary world continued to remain
7014,THE SON,oblivious of his existence. Frost sought a change of environment
7015,THE SON,"and, after a few years’ teaching at Derry and Plymouth, New"
7016,THE SON,"Hampshire, sold his farm and, with his wife and four children,"
7017,THE SON,"sailed for England in September, 1912."
7018,THE SON,
7019,THE SON,"For the first time in his life, Frost moved in a literary world."
7020,THE SON,"London was a hot-bed of poets; groups merged, dissolved and"
7021,THE SON,separated over night; controversy and creation were in the air.
7022,THE SON,"Frost took his collection of poems to a publisher with few hopes,"
7023,THE SON,went back to the suburban town of Beaconsfield and turned to other
7024,THE SON,"matters. A few months later _A Boy’s Will_ (1913), his first"
7025,THE SON,"collection, was published and Frost was recognized at once as one of"
7026,THE SON,the few authentic voices of modern poetry.
7027,THE SON,
7028,THE SON,"_A Boy’s Will_, unlike the later volumes, is frankly subjective;"
7029,THE SON,original in outlook and idiom in spite of certain reminiscences of
7030,THE SON,"Browning. Chiefly lyrical, this volume, lacking the concentrated"
7031,THE SON,"emotion of his subsequent works, is a significant introduction to"
7032,THE SON,"the following book, which has become a contemporary classic. Early"
7033,THE SON,"in 1914, Frost leased a small place in Gloucestershire, his"
7034,THE SON,neighbors being the poets Lascelles Abercrombie and W. W. Gibson. In
7035,THE SON,"the spring of the same year, _North of Boston_ (1914), one of the"
7036,THE SON,"most intensely American books ever printed, was published in"
7037,THE SON,"England. (See Preface.) This is, as he has called it, a “book of"
7038,THE SON,people.” And it is more than that—it is a book of backgrounds as
7039,THE SON,living and dramatic as the people they overshadow. Frost vivifies a
7040,THE SON,"stone wall, an empty cottage, an apple-tree, a mountain, a forgotten"
7041,THE SON,wood-pile left
7042,THE SON,
7043,THE SON,To warm the frozen swamp as best it could
7044,THE SON,"With the slow, smokeless burning of decay."
7045,THE SON,
7046,THE SON,"_North of Boston_, like its successor, contains much of the finest"
7047,THE SON,"poetry of our time. Rich in its actualities, richer in its spiritual"
7048,THE SON,"values, every line moves with the double force of observation and"
7049,THE SON,implication. The first poem in the book illustrates this power of
7050,THE SON,character and symbolism. Although Frost is not arguing for anything
7051,THE SON,"in particular, one senses here something more than the subterranean"
7052,THE SON,"enemies of walls. In “Mending Wall,” we see two elemental and"
7053,THE SON,"opposed forces. “Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,”"
7054,THE SON,"insists the seeker after causes; “Good fences make good neighbors,”"
7055,THE SON,"doggedly maintains the literal-minded lover of traditions. Here,"
7056,THE SON,"beneath the whimsical turns and pungency of expression, we have the"
7057,THE SON,essence of nationalism versus the internationalist; the struggle
7058,THE SON,between a blind responsibility and a pagan iconoclasm.
7059,THE SON,
7060,THE SON,So with all of Frost’s characters. Like the worn out incompetent in
7061,THE SON,“The Death of the Hired Man” (one of the finest _genre_ pictures of
7062,THE SON,"our time), the country boy in “Birches,” or the positive,"
7063,THE SON,"tight-lipped old lady in “The Black Cottage,” his people are always"
7064,THE SON,intensified through the poet’s circumlocutory but precise
7065,THE SON,psychology. They remain close to their soil. Frost’s monologs and
7066,THE SON,"dramatic idyls, written in a conversational blank verse, establish"
7067,THE SON,the connection between the vernacular and the language of
7068,THE SON,literature; they remain rooted in realism. But Frost is never a
7069,THE SON,"photographic realist. “There are,” he once said, “two types of"
7070,THE SON,realist—the one who offers a good deal of dirt with his potato to
7071,THE SON,show that it is a real one; and the one who is satisfied with the
7072,THE SON,"potato brushed clean. I’m inclined to be the second kind.... To me,"
7073,THE SON,the thing that art does for life is to strip it to form.”
7074,THE SON,
7075,THE SON,"In March, 1915, Frost came back to America—to a hill outside of"
7076,THE SON,"Franconia, New Hampshire, to be precise. _North of Boston_ had been"
7077,THE SON,"published in the United States and its author, who had left the"
7078,THE SON,"country an unknown writer, returned to find himself famous."
7079,THE SON,"_Mountain Interval_, containing some of Frost’s most beautiful poems"
7080,THE SON,"(“Birches,” “An Old Man’s Winter Night,” “The Hill Wife”), appeared"
7081,THE SON,"in 1916. The idiom is the same as in the earlier volumes, but the"
7082,THE SON,"notes are more varied, the convictions are stronger. The essential"
7083,THE SON,things are unchanged. The first poem in Frost’s first book sums it
7084,THE SON,up:
7085,THE SON,
7086,THE SON,They would not find me changed from him they knew—
7087,THE SON,Only more sure of all I thought was true.
7088,THE SON,
7089,THE SON,"The fanciful by-play, the sly banter, so characteristic of this"
7090,THE SON,"poet, has made his grimness far less “gray” than some of his critics"
7091,THE SON,are willing to admit. This elfin whimsy winks through the broad
7092,THE SON,"bucolic humor of “The Cow in Apple Time,” the mock pity of “The Road"
7093,THE SON,"Not Taken,” the tenderness of “The Runaway” and the lovely"
7094,THE SON,apostrophe to an orchard in “Good-Bye and Keep Cold.”
7095,THE SON,
7096,THE SON,"Frost taught at Amherst College from 1916 to 1919, but found that"
7097,THE SON,his association with scholastic life took too much of his creative
7098,THE SON,"energy. In 1920, therefore, he bought a few acres in Vermont and"
7099,THE SON,devoted himself once more to the double labors of farmer and poet.
7100,THE SON,"Through his lyrics as well as his quasi-narratives, he has uttered"
7101,THE SON,(and is voicing) some of the deepest and richest notes in American
7102,THE SON,poetry.

7107,MENDING WALL,"Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,"

7110,MENDING WALL,And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
7111,MENDING WALL,The work of hunters is another thing:
7112,MENDING WALL,I have come after them and made repair
7113,MENDING WALL,"Where they have left not one stone on a stone,"
7114,MENDING WALL,"But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,"
7115,MENDING WALL,"To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,"
7116,MENDING WALL,"No one has seen them made or heard them made,"
7117,MENDING WALL,But at spring mending-time we find them there.
7118,MENDING WALL,I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
7119,MENDING WALL,And on a day we meet to walk the line
7120,MENDING WALL,And set the wall between us once again.
7121,MENDING WALL,We keep the wall between us as we go.
7122,MENDING WALL,To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
7123,MENDING WALL,And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
7124,MENDING WALL,We have to use a spell to make them balance:
7125,MENDING WALL,“Stay where you are until our backs are turned!”
7126,MENDING WALL,We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
7127,MENDING WALL,"Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,"
7128,MENDING WALL,One on a side. It comes to little more:
7129,MENDING WALL,There where it is we do not need the wall:
7130,MENDING WALL,He is all pine and I am apple-orchard.
7131,MENDING WALL,My apple trees will never get across
7132,MENDING WALL,"And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him."
7133,MENDING WALL,"He only says, “Good fences make good neighbors.”"
7134,MENDING WALL,"Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder"
7135,MENDING WALL,If I could put a notion in his head:
7136,MENDING WALL,“_Why_ do they make good neighbors? Isn’t it
7137,MENDING WALL,Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.
7138,MENDING WALL,Before I built a wall I’d ask to know
7139,MENDING WALL,"What I was walling in or walling out,"
7140,MENDING WALL,And to whom I was like to give offence.
7141,MENDING WALL,"Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,"
7142,MENDING WALL,"That wants it down!” I could say “Elves” to him,"
7143,MENDING WALL,"But it’s not elves exactly, and I’d rather"
7144,MENDING WALL,"He said it for himself. I see him there,"
7145,MENDING WALL,Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
7146,MENDING WALL,"In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed."
7147,MENDING WALL,"He moves in darkness as it seems to me,"
7148,MENDING WALL,Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
7149,MENDING WALL,"He will not go behind his father’s saying,"
7150,MENDING WALL,And he likes having thought of it so well

7172,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"On noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly,"
7173,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7174,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,Seeking with memories grown dim over night
7175,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,Some resting flower of yesterday’s delight.
7176,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7177,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"And once I marked his flight go round and round,"
7178,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,As where some flower lay withering on the ground.
7179,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7180,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"And then he flew as far as eye could see,"
7181,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,And then on tremulous wing came back to me.
7182,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7183,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"I thought of questions that have no reply,"
7184,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,And would have turned to toss the grass to dry;
7185,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7186,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"But he turned first, and led my eye to look"
7187,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,"
7188,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7189,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared
7190,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared.
7191,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7192,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"I left my place to know them by their name,"
7193,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,Finding them butterfly-weed when I came.
7194,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7195,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"The mower in the dew had loved them thus,"
7196,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"By leaving them to flourish, not for us,"
7197,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7198,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him,"
7199,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,But from sheer morning gladness at the brim.
7200,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7201,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"The butterfly and I had lit upon,"
7202,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"Nevertheless, a message from the dawn,"
7203,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7204,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"That made me hear the wakening birds around,"
7205,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,"
7206,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7207,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,And feel a spirit kindred to my own;
7208,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,So that henceforth I worked no more alone;
7209,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7210,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"But glad with him, I worked as with his aid,"
7211,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"And weary, sought at noon with him the shade;"
7212,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7213,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech"
7214,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach.
7215,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7216,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,"“Men work together,” I told him from the heart,"
7217,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,“Whether they work together or apart.”
7218,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7219,THE TUFT OF FLOWERS,
7220,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN
7221,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7222,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table
7223,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,"
7224,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage
7225,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,To meet him in the doorway with the news
7226,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,And put him on his guard. “Silas is back.”
7227,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,She pushed him outward with her through the door
7228,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"And shut it after her. “Be kind,” she said."
7229,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,She took the market things from Warren’s arms
7230,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"And set them on the porch, then drew him down"
7231,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,To sit beside her on the wooden steps.
7232,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7233,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“When was I ever anything but kind to him?
7234,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"But I’ll not have the fellow back,” he said."
7235,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“I told him so last haying, didn’t I?"
7236,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"‘If he left then,’ I said, ‘that ended it.’"
7237,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,What good is he? Who else will harbour him
7238,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,At his age for the little he can do?
7239,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,What help he is there’s no depending on.
7240,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Off he goes always when I need him most.
7241,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"‘He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,"
7242,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Enough at least to buy tobacco with,"
7243,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,So he won’t have to beg and be beholden.’
7244,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"‘All right,’ I say, ‘I can’t afford to pay"
7245,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.’"
7246,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,‘Someone else can.’ ‘Then someone else will have to.’
7247,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I shouldn’t mind his bettering himself
7248,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"If that was what it was. You can be certain,"
7249,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"When he begins like that, there’s someone at him"
7250,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,—"
7251,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"In haying time, when any help is scarce."
7252,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,In winter he comes back to us. I’m done.”
7253,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7254,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“Sh! not so loud: he’ll hear you,” Mary said."
7255,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7256,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“I want him to: he’ll have to soon or late.”
7257,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7258,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“He’s worn out. He’s asleep beside the stove.
7259,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"When I came up from Rowe’s I found him here,"
7260,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,"
7261,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"A miserable sight, and frightening, too—"
7262,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,You needn’t smile—I didn’t recognize him—
7263,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I wasn’t looking for him—and he’s changed.
7264,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Wait till you see.”
7265,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7266,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“Where did you say he’d been?”
7267,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7268,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“He didn’t say. I dragged him to the house,"
7269,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.
7270,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I tried to make him talk about his travels.
7271,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.”
7272,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7273,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“What did he say? Did he say anything?”
7274,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7275,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“But little.”
7276,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7277,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“Anything? Mary, confess"
7278,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He said he’d come to ditch the meadow for me.”
7279,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7280,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“Warren!”
7281,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7282,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“But did he? I just want to know.”
7283,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7284,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“Of course he did. What would you have him say?
7285,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Surely you wouldn’t grudge the poor old man
7286,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Some humble way to save his self-respect.
7287,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He added, if you really care to know,"
7288,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He meant to clear the upper pasture, too."
7289,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,That sounds like something you have heard before?
7290,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Warren, I wish you could have heard the way"
7291,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He jumbled everything. I stopped to look
7292,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Two or three times—he made me feel so queer—
7293,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,To see if he was talking in his sleep.
7294,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He ran on Harold Wilson—you remember—
7295,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,The boy you had in haying four years since.
7296,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He’s finished school, and teaching in his college."
7297,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Silas declares you’ll have to get him back.
7298,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He says they two will make a team for work:
7299,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!
7300,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,The way he mixed that in with other things.
7301,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft"
7302,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,On education—you know how they fought
7303,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"All through July under the blazing sun,"
7304,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Silas up on the cart to build the load,"
7305,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Harold along beside to pitch it on.”
7306,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7307,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.”"
7308,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7309,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream."
7310,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,You wouldn’t think they would. How some things linger!
7311,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Harold’s young college boy’s assurance piqued him.
7312,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,After so many years he still keeps finding
7313,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Good arguments he sees he might have used.
7314,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I sympathise. I know just how it feels
7315,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,To think of the right thing to say too late.
7316,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Harold’s associated in his mind with Latin.
7317,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He asked me what I thought of Harold’s saying
7318,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He studied Latin like the violin
7319,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Because he liked it—that an argument!
7320,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He said he couldn’t make the boy believe
7321,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He could find water with a hazel prong—
7322,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Which showed how much good school had ever done him.
7323,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He wanted to go over that. But most of all
7324,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He thinks if he could have another chance
7325,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,To teach him how to build a load of hay—”
7326,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7327,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“I know, that’s Silas’ one accomplishment."
7328,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He bundles every forkful in its place,"
7329,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"And tags and numbers it for future reference,"
7330,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,So he can find and easily dislodge it
7331,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,In the unloading. Silas does that well.
7332,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He takes it out in bunches like birds’ nests.
7333,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,You never see him standing on the hay
7334,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He’s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.”"
7335,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7336,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“He thinks if he could teach him that, he’d be"
7337,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Some good perhaps to someone in the world.
7338,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He hates to see a boy the fool of books.
7339,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk,"
7340,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"And nothing to look backward to with pride,"
7341,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"And nothing to look forward to with hope,"
7342,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,So now and never any different.”
7343,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7344,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Part of a moon was falling down the west,"
7345,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.
7346,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw
7347,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand
7348,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,"
7349,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,"
7350,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,As if she played unheard the tenderness
7351,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,That wrought on him beside her in the night.
7352,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“Warren,” she said, “he has come home to die:"
7353,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,You needn’t be afraid he’ll leave you this time.”
7354,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7355,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“Home,” he mocked gently."
7356,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7357,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“Yes, what else but home?"
7358,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,It all depends on what you mean by home.
7359,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Of course he’s nothing to us, any more"
7360,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Than was the hound that came a stranger to us
7361,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail.”"
7362,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7363,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“Home is the place where, when you have to go there,"
7364,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,They have to take you in.”
7365,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7366,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“I should have called it
7367,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Something you somehow haven’t to deserve.”
7368,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7369,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Warren leaned out and took a step or two,"
7370,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Picked up a little stick, and brought it back"
7371,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,And broke it in his hand and tossed it by.
7372,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“Silas has better claim on us you think
7373,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles
7374,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,As the road winds would bring him to his door.
7375,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day.
7376,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Why didn’t he go there? His brother’s rich,"
7377,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,A somebody—director in the bank.”
7378,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7379,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“He never told us that.”
7380,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7381,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“We know it though.”
7382,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7383,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“I think his brother ought to help, of course."
7384,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I’ll see to that if there is need. He ought of right
7385,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"To take him in, and might be willing to—"
7386,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He may be better than appearances.
7387,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,But have some pity on Silas. Do you think
7388,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,If he’d had any pride in claiming kin
7389,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Or anything he looked for from his brother,"
7390,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He’d keep so still about him all this time?”
7391,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7392,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“I wonder what’s between them.”
7393,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7394,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“I can tell you.
7395,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Silas is what he is—we wouldn’t mind him—
7396,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,But just the kind that kinsfolk can’t abide.
7397,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He never did a thing so very bad.
7398,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He don’t know why he isn’t quite as good
7399,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,As anyone. He won’t be made ashamed
7400,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"To please his brother, worthless though he is.”"
7401,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7402,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“I can’t think Si ever hurt anyone.”
7403,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7404,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay"
7405,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.
7406,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He wouldn’t let me put him on the lounge.
7407,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,You must go in and see what you can do.
7408,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I made the bed up for him there to-night.
7409,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,You’ll be surprised at him—how much he’s broken.
7410,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,His working days are done; I’m sure of it.”
7411,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7412,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,“I’d not be in a hurry to say that.”
7413,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7414,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“I haven’t been. Go, look, see for yourself."
7415,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"But, Warren, please remember how it is:"
7416,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He’s come to help you ditch the meadow.
7417,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,He has a plan. You mustn’t laugh at him.
7418,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"He may not speak of it, and then he may."
7419,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,I’ll sit and see if that small sailing cloud
7420,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,Will hit or miss the moon.”
7421,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7422,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,It hit the moon.
7423,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Then there were three there, making a dim row,"
7424,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"The moon, the little silver cloud, and she."
7425,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7426,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Warren returned—too soon, it seemed to her,"
7427,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited."
7428,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7429,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“Warren,” she questioned."
7430,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7431,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,"“Dead,” was all he answered."
7432,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7433,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN,
7434,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD
7435,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,
7436,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,This saying good-bye on the verge of the dark
7437,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"And cold to an orchard so young in the bark,"
7438,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,Reminds me of all that can happen to harm
7439,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,An orchard away at the end of the farm
7440,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,All winter cut off by a hill from the house.
7441,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"I don’t want it girdled by rabbit and mouse,"
7442,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,I don’t want it dreamily nibbled for browse
7443,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"By deer, and I don’t want it budded by grouse,"
7444,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"(If certain it wouldn’t be idle to call,"
7445,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"I’d summon grouse, rabbit and deer to the wall"
7446,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,And warn them away with a stick for a gun.)
7447,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,I don’t want it stirred by the heat of the sun.
7448,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"(We made it secure against being, I hope,"
7449,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,By setting it out on a northerly slope.)
7450,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"No orchard’s the worse for the wintriest storm,"
7451,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"But one thing about it, it mustn’t get warm."
7452,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,“How often already you’ve had to be told
7453,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"Keep cold, young orchard. Good-bye and keep cold."
7454,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,Dread fifty above more than fifty below.”
7455,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,I have to be gone for a season or so;
7456,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"My business awhile is with different trees,"
7457,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"Less carefully nurtured, less fruitful than these"
7458,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,And such as is done to their wood with an ax—
7459,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,Maples and birches and tamaracks.
7460,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,I wish I could promise to lie in the night
7461,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,"And share in an orchard’s arboreal plight,"
7462,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,When slowly (and nobody comes with a light!)
7463,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,Its heart sinks lower under the sod;
7464,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,But something has to be left to God.
7465,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,
7466,GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD,
7467,THE RUNAWAY,THE RUNAWAY
7468,THE RUNAWAY,
7469,THE RUNAWAY,"Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,"
7470,THE RUNAWAY,We stopped by a mountain pasture to say “Whose colt?”
7471,THE RUNAWAY,"A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,"
7472,THE RUNAWAY,The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head
7473,THE RUNAWAY,And snorted to us. And then he had to bolt.
7474,THE RUNAWAY,We heard the miniature thunder where he fled
7475,THE RUNAWAY,"And we saw him or thought we saw him dim and grey,"
7476,THE RUNAWAY,Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.
7477,THE RUNAWAY,“I think the little fellow’s afraid of the snow.
7478,THE RUNAWAY,He isn’t winter-broken. It isn’t play
7479,THE RUNAWAY,With the little fellow at all. He’s running away.
7480,THE RUNAWAY,"I doubt if even his mother could tell him, ‘Sakes,"
7481,THE RUNAWAY,It’s only weather.’ He’d think she didn’t know!
7482,THE RUNAWAY,Where is his mother? He can’t be out alone.”
7483,THE RUNAWAY,And now he comes again with a clatter of stone
7484,THE RUNAWAY,And mounts the wall again with whited eyes
7485,THE RUNAWAY,And all his tail that isn’t hair up straight.
7486,THE RUNAWAY,He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.
7487,THE RUNAWAY,"“Whoever it is that leaves him out so late,"
7488,THE RUNAWAY,"When other creatures have gone to stall and bin,"
7489,THE RUNAWAY,Ought to be told to come and take him in.”
7490,THE RUNAWAY,
7491,THE RUNAWAY,
7492,BIRCHES,BIRCHES
7493,BIRCHES,
7494,BIRCHES,When I see birches bend to left and right
7495,BIRCHES,"Across the line of straighter darker trees,"
7496,BIRCHES,I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.
7497,BIRCHES,But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay.
7498,BIRCHES,Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
7499,BIRCHES,Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
7500,BIRCHES,After a rain. They click upon themselves
7501,BIRCHES,"As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored"
7502,BIRCHES,As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
7503,BIRCHES,Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells
7504,BIRCHES,Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—
7505,BIRCHES,Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
7506,BIRCHES,You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
7507,BIRCHES,"They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,"
7508,BIRCHES,And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed
7509,BIRCHES,"So low for long, they never right themselves:"
7510,BIRCHES,You may see their trunks arching in the woods
7511,BIRCHES,"Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground"
7512,BIRCHES,Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
7513,BIRCHES,Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
7514,BIRCHES,But I was going to say when Truth broke in
7515,BIRCHES,With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm
7516,BIRCHES,I should prefer to have some boy bend them
7517,BIRCHES,As he went out and in to fetch the cows—
7518,BIRCHES,"Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,"
7519,BIRCHES,"Whose only play was what he found himself,"
7520,BIRCHES,"Summer or winter, and could play alone."
7521,BIRCHES,One by one he subdued his father’s trees
7522,BIRCHES,By riding them down over and over again
7523,BIRCHES,"Until he took the stiffness out of them,"
7524,BIRCHES,"And not one but hung limp, not one was left"
7525,BIRCHES,For him to conquer. He learned all there was
7526,BIRCHES,To learn about not launching out too soon
7527,BIRCHES,And so not carrying the tree away
7528,BIRCHES,Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise
7529,BIRCHES,"To the top branches, climbing carefully"
7530,BIRCHES,With the same pains you use to fill a cup
7531,BIRCHES,"Up to the brim, and even above the brim."
7532,BIRCHES,"Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,"
7533,BIRCHES,Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.
7534,BIRCHES,
7535,BIRCHES,So was I once myself a swinger of birches;
7536,BIRCHES,And so I dream of going back to be.
7537,BIRCHES,"It’s when I’m weary of considerations,"
7538,BIRCHES,And life is too much like a pathless wood
7539,BIRCHES,Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
7540,BIRCHES,"Broken across it, and one eye is weeping"
7541,BIRCHES,From a twig’s having lashed across it open.
7542,BIRCHES,I’d like to get away from earth awhile
7543,BIRCHES,And then come back to it and begin over.
7544,BIRCHES,May no fate wilfully misunderstand me
7545,BIRCHES,And half grant what I wish and snatch me away
7546,BIRCHES,Not to return. Earth’s the right place for love:
7547,BIRCHES,I don’t know where it’s likely to go better.
7548,BIRCHES,"I’d like to go by climbing a birch tree,"
7549,BIRCHES,And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
7550,BIRCHES,"_Toward_ heaven, till the tree could bear no more,"
7551,BIRCHES,But dipped its top and set me down again.
7552,BIRCHES,That would be good both going and coming back.
7553,BIRCHES,One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.

7586,THE ONSET,"As measured against maple, birch and oak;"
7587,THE ONSET,It cannot check the Peeper’s silver croak;

7589,THE ONSET,In water of a slender April rill
7590,THE ONSET,That flashes tail through last year’s withered brake
7591,THE ONSET,And dead weeds like a disappearing snake.

7599,THE ONSET,
7600,THE ONSET,
7601,THE ONSET,"William Ellery Leonard was born at Plainfield, New Jersey, January"
7602,THE ONSET,"25, 1876. He received his A.M. at Harvard in 1899 and completed his"
7603,THE ONSET,studies at the Universities of Göttingen and Bonn. After traveling
7604,THE ONSET,"for several years throughout Europe, he became a teacher and has"
7605,THE ONSET,been professor of English in the University of Wisconsin since 1906.
7606,THE ONSET,
7607,THE ONSET,_The Vaunt of Man_ (1912) is Leonard’s most representative volume.
7608,THE ONSET,"Traditional in form and material, it is anything but conservative in"
7609,THE ONSET,spirit. Leonard’s insurrectionary fervor speaks sonorously in the
7610,THE ONSET,simplest of his quatrains and the strictest of his sonnets. This
7611,THE ONSET,protesting passion is given an even wider sweep in _The Lynching
7612,THE ONSET,"Bee_ (1920), the title-poem being a terrific indictment in which the"
7613,THE ONSET,poet’s outrage speaks with a new ironism.
7614,THE ONSET,
7615,THE ONSET,"Besides his original poetry, Leonard has published several volumes"
7616,THE ONSET,of translations from the Greek and Latin as well as a series of
7617,THE ONSET,paraphrases of the fables of Æsop.

7707,THE INCENTIVE,_Carl Sandburg_
7708,THE INCENTIVE,
7709,THE INCENTIVE,
7710,THE INCENTIVE,"Carl (August) Sandburg was born of Swedish stock at Galesburg,"
7711,THE INCENTIVE,"Illinois, January 6, 1878. His schooling was haphazard; at thirteen"
7712,THE INCENTIVE,"he went to work on a milk wagon. During the next six years he was,"
7713,THE INCENTIVE,"in rapid succession, porter in a barber-shop, scene-shifter in a"
7714,THE INCENTIVE,"cheap theatre, truck-handler in a brickyard, turner apprentice in a"
7715,THE INCENTIVE,"pottery, dish-washer in Denver and Omaha hotels, harvest hand in"
7716,THE INCENTIVE,"Kansas wheat fields. These tasks equipped him, as no amount of"
7717,THE INCENTIVE,"learning could have done, to be the laureate of industrial America."
7718,THE INCENTIVE,"When war with Spain was declared in 1898, Sandburg, avid for fresh"
7719,THE INCENTIVE,"adventure, enlisted in Company C., Sixth Illinois Volunteers."
7720,THE INCENTIVE,
7721,THE INCENTIVE,"On his return from the campaign in Porto Rico, Sandburg entered"
7722,THE INCENTIVE,"Lombard College in Galesburg and, for the first time, began to think"
7723,THE INCENTIVE,in terms of literature. He had already seen a great deal of the
7724,THE INCENTIVE,world from the roaring alleys of great cities as well as from the
7725,THE INCENTIVE,"underside of box-cars; he had loafed, fought and expressed himself"
7726,THE INCENTIVE,"richly. So, what with the fact that the “terrible Swede,” as captain"
7727,THE INCENTIVE,"of the basket-ball team, won a series of new victories, it is little"
7728,THE INCENTIVE,wonder that he was idolized by his class-mates and elected
7729,THE INCENTIVE,editor-in-chief of the college paper.
7730,THE INCENTIVE,
7731,THE INCENTIVE,After leaving college he did all manner of things to earn a living.
7732,THE INCENTIVE,He was advertising manager for a department store and worked as
7733,THE INCENTIVE,district organizer for the Social-Democratic party of Wisconsin. He
7734,THE INCENTIVE,"became a salesman, a pamphleteer, a newspaperman. On the staff of a"
7735,THE INCENTIVE,"business magazine, he became a “safety first” expert; his articles"
7736,THE INCENTIVE,on accident prevention bringing him before manufacturers’
7737,THE INCENTIVE,conventions where he talked about machinery safeguards and methods
7738,THE INCENTIVE,found successful in reducing injuries in factory organizations.
7739,THE INCENTIVE,
7740,THE INCENTIVE,"In 1904, Sandburg published the proverbial “slender sheaf”; a tiny"
7741,THE INCENTIVE,"pamphlet of twenty-two poems, uneven in quality but strangely like"
7742,THE INCENTIVE,"the work of the mature Sandburg in feeling. What is more, these"
7743,THE INCENTIVE,"experiments anticipated the very inflection of the later poems, with"
7744,THE INCENTIVE,"their spiritual kinship to Henley, Lincoln and Whitman; several of"
7745,THE INCENTIVE,these early experiments (with the exception of the rhymed verses)
7746,THE INCENTIVE,"might be placed, without seeming incongruous, in the most recent"
7747,THE INCENTIVE,collection of Sandburg’s pieces. The idiom of _Smoke and Steel_
7748,THE INCENTIVE,"(1920) is more intensified, but it is the same idiom as that of"
7749,THE INCENTIVE,"“Milville” (1903), which begins:"
7750,THE INCENTIVE,
7751,THE INCENTIVE,Down in southern New Jersey they make glass.
7752,THE INCENTIVE,"By day and by night, the fires burn on in Milville and bid the sand"
7753,THE INCENTIVE,let in the light.
7754,THE INCENTIVE,
7755,THE INCENTIVE,Meanwhile the newspaperman was having a hard struggle to keep the
7756,THE INCENTIVE,"poet alive. Until he was thirty-six years old, Sandburg was totally"
7757,THE INCENTIVE,unknown to the literary world. In 1914 a group of his poems appeared
7758,THE INCENTIVE,in _Poetry; A Magazine of Verse_; later the same year one of the
7759,THE INCENTIVE,group (the now famous “Chicago”) was awarded the Levinson prize of
7760,THE INCENTIVE,"two hundred dollars. A little more than a year later his first,"
7761,THE INCENTIVE,"full-fledged book was published, and Sandburg—tardily but"
7762,THE INCENTIVE,triumphantly—had arrived.
7763,THE INCENTIVE,
7764,THE INCENTIVE,_Chicago Poems_ (1916) is full of ferment; it seethes with a direct
7765,THE INCENTIVE,poetry surcharged with tremendous energy. Here is an almost animal
7766,THE INCENTIVE,exultation that is also an exaltation. Sandburg’s speech is simple
7767,THE INCENTIVE,and powerful; he uses slang as freely (and beautifully) as his
7768,THE INCENTIVE,predecessors used the now archaic tongue of their times. (See
7769,THE INCENTIVE,Preface.) Immediately the cries of protest were heard: Sandburg was
7770,THE INCENTIVE,"coarse and brutal; his work ugly and distorted; his language,"
7771,THE INCENTIVE,"unrefined, unfit for poetry. His detractors forgot that Sandburg was"
7772,THE INCENTIVE,"only brutal when dealing with brutality; that beneath his toughness,"
7773,THE INCENTIVE,"he was one of the tenderest of living poets; that, when he used"
7774,THE INCENTIVE,"colloquialisms and a richly metaphorical slang, he was searching for"
7775,THE INCENTIVE,"new poetic values in “limber, lasting, fierce words”—unconsciously"
7776,THE INCENTIVE,"answering Whitman who asked, “Do you suppose the liberties and brawn"
7777,THE INCENTIVE,of These States have to do only with delicate lady-words? With
7778,THE INCENTIVE,gloved gentleman-words?”
7779,THE INCENTIVE,
7780,THE INCENTIVE,_Cornhuskers_ (1918) is another step forward; it is fully as
7781,THE INCENTIVE,sweeping as its forerunner and far more sensitive. The gain in power
7782,THE INCENTIVE,"and restraint is evident in the very first poem, a magnificent"
7783,THE INCENTIVE,panoramic vision of the prairie. Here is something of the surge of a
7784,THE INCENTIVE,"Norse saga; _Cornhuskers_ is keen with a salty vigor, a vast"
7785,THE INCENTIVE,sympathy for all that is splendid and terrible in Nature. But the
7786,THE INCENTIVE,"raw violence is restrained to the point of mysticism. There are, in"
7787,THE INCENTIVE,"this volume, dozens of those delicate perceptions of beauty that"
7788,THE INCENTIVE,must astonish those who think that Sandburg can write only a
7789,THE INCENTIVE,"big-fisted, rough-neck sort of poetry. “Cool Tombs,” one of the most"
7790,THE INCENTIVE,"poignant lyrics of our time, moves with a new music; “Grass”"
7791,THE INCENTIVE,"whispers as quietly as the earlier “Fog” stole in on stealthy, cat"
7792,THE INCENTIVE,feet.
7793,THE INCENTIVE,
7794,THE INCENTIVE,_Smoke and Steel_ (1920) is the synthesis and sublimation of its
7795,THE INCENTIVE,"predecessors. In this ripest of his collections, Sandburg has fused"
7796,THE INCENTIVE,"mood, accent and image in a new intensity. It is a fit setting for"
7797,THE INCENTIVE,"the title-poem; it is, in spite of certain over-mystical accents, an"
7798,THE INCENTIVE,"epic of industrialism. Smoke-belching chimneys are here, quarries"
7799,THE INCENTIVE,and great boulders of iron-ribbed rock; here are titanic visions:
7800,THE INCENTIVE,the dreams of men and machinery. And silence is here—the silence of
7801,THE INCENTIVE,sleeping tenements and sun-soaked cornfields. _Smoke and Steel_ is a
7802,THE INCENTIVE,rich amalgam; indigenous to the core. And what makes it so vital is
7803,THE INCENTIVE,"Sandburg’s own spirit: a never-sated joy in existence, a continually"
7804,THE INCENTIVE,fresh delight in the variety and wonder of life.

8310,DEDICATION,
8311,DEDICATION,"James Branch Cabell was born at Richmond, Virginia, April 14, 1879."
8312,DEDICATION,He taught French and Greek for two years at William and Mary College
8313,DEDICATION,"(1896-7), worked in the pressroom of the Richmond _Times_ (1898),"
8314,DEDICATION,was on the staff of the New York _Herald_ (1899-1901) and began
8315,DEDICATION,"contributing to the magazines in 1902, writing over sixty short"
8316,DEDICATION,"stories as well as scattered essays, translations and papers on"
8317,DEDICATION,historical and biographical subjects.
8318,DEDICATION,
8319,DEDICATION,"Although Cabell likes to describe himself as a genealogist, he is"
8320,DEDICATION,the author of some of the most exquisite prose in contemporary
8321,DEDICATION,literature. But it is a prose that rises high above its own beauty
8322,DEDICATION,"of style. In books like _The Certain Hour_ (1916), _The Cream of the"
8323,DEDICATION,"Jest_ (1917), _Jurgen_ (1919) and the poetry-crammed “comedy of"
8324,DEDICATION,"appearances,” _Figures of Earth_ (1921), the composite Cabell hero"
8325,DEDICATION,"emerges, triumphant in the midst of his defeats—the eternally"
8326,DEDICATION,"disillusioned, eternally hopeful Jurgen-Charteris-Kennaston: a"
8327,DEDICATION,"symbol of the human soul seeking some sort of finality, some"
8328,DEDICATION,assurance in a world of illimitable perplexities.
8329,DEDICATION,
8330,DEDICATION,"Though Cabell is best known as a novelist, his books are liberally"
8331,DEDICATION,"dotted with original verses that do duty as chapter-headings,"
8332,DEDICATION,"mottoes, tail-pieces, interpolated songs and epilogues. A complete"
8333,DEDICATION,"volume of his verse, _From the Hidden Way_ (1916), bore the subtitle"
8334,DEDICATION,“Being Seventy-Five Adaptations.” It purported to be paraphrases
8335,DEDICATION,"from forgotten troubadours like Allesandro de Medici, Antoine Riczi,"
8336,DEDICATION,Charles Garnier and half a dozen other obscure Parnassians. Cabell
8337,DEDICATION,even quoted the first lines of each of their poems in the original
8338,DEDICATION,"Latin, French or Provençal. Even after the hoax was exposed, it was"
8339,DEDICATION,difficult for most readers to believe that the entire
8340,DEDICATION,"collection—names, references, first lines in the “original” and"
8341,DEDICATION,"all—were the creation of Cabell, the masquerader."
8342,DEDICATION,
8343,DEDICATION,"In _From the Hidden Way_, the romancer has added another story to"
8344,DEDICATION,that gem-studded ivory tower in which Cabell lives and escapes the
8345,DEDICATION,modern world. Whether he echoes the mediæval ballata or the more
8346,DEDICATION,"modern rondeau, roundel and sonnet, his is an artifice solidly"
8347,DEDICATION,erected upon art.

8428,ONE END OF LOVE,_Vachel Lindsay_
8429,ONE END OF LOVE,
8430,ONE END OF LOVE,
8431,ONE END OF LOVE,(Nicholas) Vachel Lindsay was born in the house where he still lives
8432,ONE END OF LOVE,"in Springfield, Illinois, November 10, 1879. His home is next door"
8433,ONE END OF LOVE,to the Executive mansion of the State of Illinois; from the window
8434,ONE END OF LOVE,"where Lindsay does most of his writing, he saw many Governors come"
8435,ONE END OF LOVE,"and go, including the martyred John P. Altgeld, whom he has"
8436,ONE END OF LOVE,celebrated in one of his finest poems. He graduated from the
8437,ONE END OF LOVE,"Springfield High School, attended Hiram College (1897-1900), studied"
8438,ONE END OF LOVE,at the Art Institute at Chicago (1900-3) and at the New York School
8439,ONE END OF LOVE,"of Art (1904). After two years of lecturing and settlement work, he"
8440,ONE END OF LOVE,"took the first of his long tramps, walking through Florida, Georgia"
8441,ONE END OF LOVE,"and the Carolinas, preaching “the gospel of beauty,” and formulating"
8442,ONE END OF LOVE,his unique plans for a communal art. (See Preface.) During the
8443,ONE END OF LOVE,"following five years, Lindsay made several of these trips,"
8444,ONE END OF LOVE,travelling as a combination missionary and minstrel. Like a true
8445,ONE END OF LOVE,"revivalist, he attempted to wake in the people he met, a response to"
8446,ONE END OF LOVE,"beauty; like Tommy Tucker, he sang, recited and chanted for his"
8447,ONE END OF LOVE,"supper, distributing a little pamphlet entitled “Rhymes to be Traded"
8448,ONE END OF LOVE,for Bread.”
8449,ONE END OF LOVE,
8450,ONE END OF LOVE,Lindsay began to create more poetry to reach the public—all of his
8451,ONE END OF LOVE,"verse being written in his rôle of apostle. He was, primarily, a"
8452,ONE END OF LOVE,"rhyming John the Baptist singing to convert the heathen, to"
8453,ONE END OF LOVE,stimulate and encourage the half-hearted dreams that hide and are
8454,ONE END OF LOVE,lost in our sordid villages and townships. But the great audiences
8455,ONE END OF LOVE,"he was endeavoring to reach did not hear him, even though his"
8456,ONE END OF LOVE,collection _General Booth Enters Into Heaven_ (1913) struck many a
8457,ONE END OF LOVE,loud and racy note.
8458,ONE END OF LOVE,
8459,ONE END OF LOVE,"Lindsay broadened his effects, developed the chant and, the"
8460,ONE END OF LOVE,"following year, published his _The Congo and Other Poems_ (1914), an"
8461,ONE END OF LOVE,"infectious blend of rhymes, ragtime and religion. In the title-poem"
8462,ONE END OF LOVE,"and, in a lesser degree, the three companion chants, Lindsay struck"
8463,ONE END OF LOVE,his most powerful—and most popular—vein. They gave people
8464,ONE END OF LOVE,(particularly when intoned aloud) that primitive joy in syncopated
8465,ONE END OF LOVE,sound that is at the very base of song. In these experiments in
8466,ONE END OF LOVE,"breaking down the barriers between poetry and music, Lindsay"
8467,ONE END OF LOVE,(obviously infected by the echolalia of Poe’s “Bells”) tried to
8468,ONE END OF LOVE,"create what he called a “Higher Vaudeville” imagination, carrying"
8469,ONE END OF LOVE,the form back to the old Greek precedent where every line was
8470,ONE END OF LOVE,"half-spoken, half-sung."
8471,ONE END OF LOVE,
8472,ONE END OF LOVE,"Lindsay’s innovation succeeded at once. The novelty, the speed, the"
8473,ONE END OF LOVE,clatter forced the attention of people who had never paid the
8474,ONE END OF LOVE,slightest heed to the poet’s quieter verses. Men heard the _sounds_
8475,ONE END OF LOVE,of energetic America in these lines even when they were deaf to its
8476,ONE END OF LOVE,"spirit. They failed to see that, beneath the noise of “The Kallyope"
8477,ONE END OF LOVE,"Yell” and “The Sante Fé Trail,” Lindsay was partly an admirer,"
8478,ONE END OF LOVE,partly an ironical critic of the shrieking energy of these states.
8479,ONE END OF LOVE,"By his effort to win the enemy over, Lindsay had persuaded the"
8480,ONE END OF LOVE,"proverbially tired business man to listen at last. But, in"
8481,ONE END OF LOVE,"overstressing the vaudeville features, there arose the danger of"
8482,ONE END OF LOVE,Lindsay the poet being lost in Lindsay the entertainer. The
8483,ONE END OF LOVE,sympathetic and colorful studies of negro spirits and psychology
8484,ONE END OF LOVE,"(seen at their best in “The Congo,” “John Brown” and “Simon Legree”)"
8485,ONE END OF LOVE,degenerated into the crude buffooneries of “The Daniel Jazz” and
8486,ONE END OF LOVE,“The Blacksmith’s Serenade.”
8487,ONE END OF LOVE,
8488,ONE END OF LOVE,"But Lindsay’s earnestness, keyed up by an exuberant fancy, saved"
8489,ONE END OF LOVE,him. _The Chinese Nightingale_ (1917) begins with one of the most
8490,ONE END OF LOVE,whimsical pieces Lindsay has ever devised. And if the subsequent
8491,ONE END OF LOVE,"_The Golden Whales of California_ (1920) is less distinctive, it is"
8492,ONE END OF LOVE,principally because the author has written too much and too speedily
8493,ONE END OF LOVE,"to be self-critical. It is his peculiar appraisal of loveliness, the"
8494,ONE END OF LOVE,"rollicking high spirits joined to a stubborn evangelism, that makes"
8495,ONE END OF LOVE,Lindsay so representative a product of his environment.
8496,ONE END OF LOVE,
8497,ONE END OF LOVE,"Besides his original poetry, Lindsay has embodied his experiences"
8498,ONE END OF LOVE,"and meditations on the road in two prose volumes, _A Handy Guide for"
8499,ONE END OF LOVE,Beggars_ (1916) and _Adventures While Preaching the Gospel of
8500,ONE END OF LOVE,"Beauty_ (1914), as well as a prophetic study of the “silent drama,”"
8501,ONE END OF LOVE,_The Art of the Moving Picture_ (1915).

9049,THOSE TWO BOYS,He worried his parents a lot;

9051,THOSE TWO BOYS,His boyhood was naught but a blot.
9052,THOSE TWO BOYS,
9053,THOSE TWO BOYS,At play and in school he would fracture each rule—
9054,THOSE TWO BOYS,In mischief from autumn to spring;

9058,THOSE TWO BOYS,When Jim was a child he was not very wild;
9059,THOSE TWO BOYS,He was known as a good little boy;

9077,THOSE TWO BOYS,
9078,THOSE TWO BOYS,
9079,THOSE TWO BOYS,"John Gneisenau Neihardt was born at Sharpsburg, Illinois, January 8,"
9080,THOSE TWO BOYS,1881. He completed a scientific course at Nebraska Normal College in
9081,THOSE TWO BOYS,"1897 and lived among the Omaha Indians for six years (1901-7),"
9082,THOSE TWO BOYS,"studying their customs, characteristics and legends."
9083,THOSE TWO BOYS,
9084,THOSE TWO BOYS,"Although he had already published two books, _A Bundle of Myrrh_"
9085,THOSE TWO BOYS,(1908) was his first volume to attract notice. It was full of
9086,THOSE TWO BOYS,"spirit, enthusiasm and an insistent virility—qualities which were"
9087,THOSE TWO BOYS,extended (and overemphasized) in _Man-Song_ (1909). Neihardt found a
9088,THOSE TWO BOYS,richer note and a new restraint in _The Stranger at the Gate_
9089,THOSE TWO BOYS,(1911); the best of the lyrics from these three volumes appearing in
9090,THOSE TWO BOYS,_The Quest_ (1916).
9091,THOSE TWO BOYS,
9092,THOSE TWO BOYS,"Neihardt meanwhile had been going deeper into folk-lore, the results"
9093,THOSE TWO BOYS,of which appeared in _The Song of Hugh Glass_ (1915) and _The Song
9094,THOSE TWO BOYS,"of Three Friends_ (1919). The latter, in 1920, divided the annual"
9095,THOSE TWO BOYS,"prize offered by the Poetry Society, halving the honors with Gladys"
9096,THOSE TWO BOYS,"Cromwell’s _Poems_. These two of Neihardt’s are detailed long poems,"
9097,THOSE TWO BOYS,part of a projected epic series celebrating the winning of the West
9098,THOSE TWO BOYS,by the pioneers. What prevents both volumes from fulfilling the
9099,THOSE TWO BOYS,breadth at which they aim is the disparity between the author’s
9100,THOSE TWO BOYS,story and his style; essentially racy narratives are recited in an
9101,THOSE TWO BOYS,"archaic and incongruous speech. Yet, in spite of a false rhetoric"
9102,THOSE TWO BOYS,and a locution that considers prairies and trappers in terms of
9103,THOSE TWO BOYS,"“Ilion,” “Iseult,” “Clotho,” the “dim far shore of Styx,” Neihardt"
9104,THOSE TWO BOYS,"has achieved his effects with no little skill. Dramatic, stern, and"
9105,THOSE TWO BOYS,"conceived with a powerful dignity, his major works are American in"
9106,THOSE TWO BOYS,feeling if not in execution.

9181,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],_Witter Bynner_
9182,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],
9183,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],
9184,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"Witter Bynner was born at Brooklyn, New York, August 10, 1881. He"
9185,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],was graduated from Harvard in 1902 and has been assistant editor of
9186,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"various periodicals as well as adviser to publishers. Recently, he"
9187,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],has spent much of his time lecturing on poetry and travelling in the
9188,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],Orient.
9189,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],
9190,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"_Young Harvard_ (1907), the first of Bynner’s volumes, was, as the"
9191,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"name implies, a celebration of his _alma mater. The New World_"
9192,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],(1915) is a much riper and far more ambitious effort. In this
9193,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"extended poem, Bynner sought—almost too determinedly—to translate"
9194,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],the ideals of democracy into verse. Neither of these volumes
9195,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"displays its author’s gifts at their best, for Bynner is, first of"
9196,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"all, a lyric poet. _Grenstone Poems_ (1917) and _A Canticle of Pan_"
9197,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],(1920) reveal a more natural singing voice. Bynner harmonizes in
9198,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"many keys; transposing, modulating and shifting from one tonality to"
9199,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"another. This very ease is his chief defect, for Bynner’s facility"
9200,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],leads him not only to write too much but in too many different
9201,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],styles. Many of his poems seem like sounding-boards that echo the
9202,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],tones of every poet except the composer of them. Instead of a fusion
9203,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"of gifts we have, too often, a disintegration."
9204,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],
9205,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],When Bynner is least dexterous he is most ingratiating. When he does
9206,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],not try to sound the whole gamut of modern poetry from the lyrics of
9207,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"A. E. Housman to the attenuated epigrams of Ezra Pound, he can"
9208,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],strike his own note with clarity and precision. Even in _The Beloved
9209,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"Stranger_ (1919), where the borrowed accents of his _alter ego_ are"
9210,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"only too apparent, one is arrested by lines of musical charm and"
9211,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],fluency.
9212,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],
9213,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],"Under the pseudonym “Emanuel Morgan,” Bynner was coauthor with"
9214,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],Arthur Davison Ficke (writing under the name of “Anne Knish”) of
9215,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],_Spectra_ (1916). _Spectra_ was a serious burlesque of some of the
9216,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],extreme manifestations of modern poetic tendencies—a remarkable hoax
9217,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],that deceived many of the radical propagandists as well as most of
9218,LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS[39],the conservative critics.

9249,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],“Lincoln?—
9250,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],"Well, I was in the old Second Maine,"
9251,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],The first regiment in Washington from the Pine Tree State.
9252,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],Of course I didn’t get the butt of the clip;
9253,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],We was there for guardin’ Washington—
9254,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],We was all green.
9255,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],
9256,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],“I ain’t never ben to the theayter in my life—
9257,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],I didn’t know how to behave.
9258,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],I ain’t never ben since.
9259,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],I can see as plain as my hat the box where he sat in
9260,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],When he was shot.
9261,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],"I can tell you, sir, there was a panic"
9262,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],When we found our President was in the shape he was in!
9263,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],Never saw a soldier in the world but what liked him.
9264,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],
9265,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],"“Yes, sir. His looks was kind o’ hard to forget."
9266,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],"He was a spare man,"
9267,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],An old farmer.
9268,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],"Everything was all right, you know,"
9269,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],But he wasn’t a smooth-appearin’ man at all—
9270,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],Not in no ways;
9271,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],"Thin-faced, long-necked,"
9272,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],And a swellin’ kind of a thick lip like.
9273,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],
9274,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],“And he was a jolly old fellow—always cheerful;
9275,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],He wasn’t so high but the boys could talk to him their own ways.
9276,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],While I was servin’ at the Hospital
9277,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],"He’d come in and say, ‘You look nice in here,’"
9278,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],"Praise us up, you know."
9279,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],And he’d bend over and talk to the boys—
9280,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],And he’d talk so good to ’em—so close—
9281,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],That’s why I call him a farmer.
9282,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],"I don’t mean that everything about him wasn’t all right, you understand,"
9283,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],"It’s just—well, I was a farmer—"
9284,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],"And he was my neighbor, anybody’s neighbor."
9285,A FARMER REMEMBERS LINCOLN[40][41],I guess even you young folks would ’a’ liked him.”

9290,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Outside hove Shasta, snowy height on height,"
9291,TRAIN-MATES[42],"A glory; but a negligible sight,"
9292,TRAIN-MATES[42],For you had often seen a mountain-peak
9293,TRAIN-MATES[42],But not my paper. So we came to speak ...
9294,TRAIN-MATES[42],"A smoke, a smile,—a good way to commence"
9295,TRAIN-MATES[42],The comfortable exchange of difference!
9296,TRAIN-MATES[42],"You a young engineer, five feet eleven,"
9297,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Forty-five chest, with football in your heaven,"
9298,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Liking a road-bed newly built and clean,"
9299,TRAIN-MATES[42],Your fingers hot to cut away the green
9300,TRAIN-MATES[42],Of brush and flowers that bring beside a track
9301,TRAIN-MATES[42],"The kind of beauty steel lines ought to lack,—"
9302,TRAIN-MATES[42],"And I a poet, wistful of my betters,"
9303,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Reading George Meredith’s high-hearted letters,"
9304,TRAIN-MATES[42],Joining betweenwhile in the mingled speech
9305,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Of a drummer, circus-man, and parson, each"
9306,TRAIN-MATES[42],Absorbing to himself—as I to me
9307,TRAIN-MATES[42],And you to you—a glad identity!
9308,TRAIN-MATES[42],
9309,TRAIN-MATES[42],"After a time, when others went away,"
9310,TRAIN-MATES[42],"A curious kinship made us choose to stay,"
9311,TRAIN-MATES[42],Which I could tell you now; but at the time
9312,TRAIN-MATES[42],"You thought of baseball teams and I of rhyme,"
9313,TRAIN-MATES[42],Until we found that we were college men
9314,TRAIN-MATES[42],And smoked more easily and smiled again;
9315,TRAIN-MATES[42],"And I from Cambridge cried, the poet still:"
9316,TRAIN-MATES[42],“I know your fine Greek theatre on the hill
9317,TRAIN-MATES[42],At Berkeley!” With your happy Grecian head
9318,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Upraised, “I never saw the place,” you said—"
9319,TRAIN-MATES[42],"“Once I was free of class, I always went"
9320,TRAIN-MATES[42],Out to the field.”
9321,TRAIN-MATES[42],
9322,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Young engineer, you meant"
9323,TRAIN-MATES[42],As fair a tribute to the better part
9324,TRAIN-MATES[42],As ever I did. Beauty of the heart
9325,TRAIN-MATES[42],Is evident in temples. But it breathes
9326,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Alive where athletes quicken curly wreaths,"
9327,TRAIN-MATES[42],Which are the lovelier because they die.
9328,TRAIN-MATES[42],"You are a poet quite as much as I,"
9329,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Though differences appear in what we do,"
9330,TRAIN-MATES[42],And I an athlete quite as much as you.
9331,TRAIN-MATES[42],Because you half-surmise my quarter-mile
9332,TRAIN-MATES[42],"And I your quatrain, we could greet and smile."
9333,TRAIN-MATES[42],Who knows but we shall look again and find
9334,TRAIN-MATES[42],"The circus-man and drummer, not behind"
9335,TRAIN-MATES[42],But leading in our visible estate—
9336,TRAIN-MATES[42],As discus-thrower and as laureate?

9340,TRAIN-MATES[42],
9341,TRAIN-MATES[42],_James Oppenheim_
9342,TRAIN-MATES[42],
9343,TRAIN-MATES[42],
9344,TRAIN-MATES[42],"James Oppenheim was born at St. Paul, Minnesota, May 24, 1882. Two"
9345,TRAIN-MATES[42],"years later his family moved to New York City, where he has lived"
9346,TRAIN-MATES[42],"ever since. After a public school education, he took special courses"
9347,TRAIN-MATES[42],"at Columbia University (1901-3) and engaged in settlement work,"
9348,TRAIN-MATES[42],acting in the capacity of assistant head worker of the Hudson Guild
9349,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Settlement, and superintendent of the Hebrew Technical School for"
9350,TRAIN-MATES[42],Girls (1904-7). His studies and experiences on the lower East Side
9351,TRAIN-MATES[42],"of New York furnished the material for his first, and most popular,"
9352,TRAIN-MATES[42],"book of short stories, _Doctor Rast_ (1909)."
9353,TRAIN-MATES[42],
9354,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Oppenheim’s initial venture as a poet, _Monday Morning and Other"
9355,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Poems_ (1909), was a tentative collection; half imitative, half"
9356,TRAIN-MATES[42],"experimental. In spite of its obvious indebtedness to Whitman, most"
9357,TRAIN-MATES[42],of the verses are in formal meters and regular (though ragged)
9358,TRAIN-MATES[42],rhyme. Beauty is sought but seldom captured here; the message is
9359,TRAIN-MATES[42],coughed out between bursts of eloquence and fits of stammering.
9360,TRAIN-MATES[42],
9361,TRAIN-MATES[42],With _Songs for the New Age_ (1914) Oppenheim became his own
9362,TRAIN-MATES[42],"liberator. The stammering has gone, the uncouth dissonances have"
9363,TRAIN-MATES[42],"resolved. One listens to a speech that, echoing the Whitmanic"
9364,TRAIN-MATES[42],"sonority, develops a music that is strangely Biblical and yet local."
9365,TRAIN-MATES[42],"It is the expression of an ancient people reacting to modernity, of"
9366,TRAIN-MATES[42],"a race in solution. (See Preface.) This volume, like all of"
9367,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Oppenheim’s subsequent work, is analysis in terms of poetry; a slow"
9368,TRAIN-MATES[42],searching beneath the musical surface that attempts to diagnose the
9369,TRAIN-MATES[42],twisted soul of man and the twisted times he lives in. The old
9370,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Isaiah note, with a new introspection, rises out of such poems as"
9371,TRAIN-MATES[42],"“The Slave,” “We Dead,” “Tasting the Earth”; the music and imagery"
9372,TRAIN-MATES[42],"of the Psalms are heard in “The Flocks,” “The Tree” and “The Runner"
9373,TRAIN-MATES[42],in the Skies.”
9374,TRAIN-MATES[42],
9375,TRAIN-MATES[42],_War and Laughter_ (1916) holds much of its predecessor’s exaltation
9376,TRAIN-MATES[42],and an almost ecstatic discontent. The Semitic blend of delight and
9377,TRAIN-MATES[42],disillusion—that quality which hates the world for its shams and
9378,TRAIN-MATES[42],"hypocrisies and loves it in spite of them—is revealed in “Greed,” in"
9379,TRAIN-MATES[42],the ironic “Report on the Planet Earth” and the brightly affirmative
9380,TRAIN-MATES[42],“Laughter.”
9381,TRAIN-MATES[42],
9382,TRAIN-MATES[42],"_The Book of Self_ (1917) is less notable, an imperfect fusion."
9383,TRAIN-MATES[42],Oppenheim’s preoccupation with analytical psychology mars the effect
9384,TRAIN-MATES[42],"of the long passages which, in themselves, contain flashes of"
9385,TRAIN-MATES[42],clairvoyance. _The Solitary_ (1919) is a great stride forward; its
9386,TRAIN-MATES[42],"major section, a long symbolic poem called “The Sea,” breathes the"
9387,TRAIN-MATES[42],same note that was the burden of the earlier books—“We are flesh on
9388,TRAIN-MATES[42],the way to godhood”—with greater strength and still greater control.
9389,TRAIN-MATES[42],
9390,TRAIN-MATES[42],"Besides his poetry, Oppenheim has published several volumes of short"
9391,TRAIN-MATES[42],"stories, four novels, and two poetic plays. During 1916-17 he was"
9392,TRAIN-MATES[42],"editor of that promising but short-lived magazine, _The Seven Arts_."

9468,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],O Night that is the starriest
9469,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Since Earth began to roll—
9470,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],For a Soul
9471,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Is born out of Love!
9472,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Mother love, father love, love of Eternal God—"
9473,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Stars have pushed aside to let him through—
9474,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Through heaven’s sun-sown deeps
9475,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],One sparkling ray of God
9476,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Strikes the clod—
9477,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],(And while an angel-host through wood and clearing sweeps!)
9478,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Born in the wild
9479,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],The Child—
9480,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Naked, ruddy, new,"

9495,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Sweet Mother of the Wilderness,"

9503,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"In a lair of the wild bee,"
9504,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"The rugged boy, by danger’s stress,"
9505,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Learnt the speech the wild things speak,"
9506,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Learnt the Earth’s eternal tune
9507,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Of strife-engendered harmony—
9508,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Went to school where Life itself was master,"
9509,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Went to church where Earth was minister—
9510,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],And in Danger and Disaster
9511,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Felt his future manhood stir!
9512,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],
9513,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"All about him the land,"
9514,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Eastern cities, Western prairie,"
9515,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Wild, immeasurable, grand;"
9516,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],But he was lost where blossomy boughs make airy
9517,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Bowers in the forest, and the sand"
9518,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Makes brook-water a clear mirror that gives back
9519,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Green branches and trunks black
9520,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],And clouds across the heavens lightly fanned.
9521,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],
9522,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Yet all the Future dreams, eager to waken,"
9523,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Within that woodland soul—
9524,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],And the bough of boy has only to be shaken
9525,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],That the fruit drop whereby this Earth shall roll
9526,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],A little nearer God than ever before.
9527,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Little recks he of war,"
9528,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Of national millions waiting on his word—

9530,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"In the heart of the boy, the little babe of the wild—"

9532,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Of Time flows fast and ebbs, and he, even he,"
9533,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Must leave the wilderness, the wood-haunts wild—"
9534,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Soon shall the cyclone of Humanity
9535,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Tearing through Earth suck up this little child
9536,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"And whirl him to the top, where he shall be"
9537,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Riding the storm-column in the lightning-stroke,"
9538,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Calm at the peak, while down below worlds rage,"
9539,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"And Earth goes out in blood and battle-smoke,"
9540,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],And leaves him with the sun—an epoch and an age!
9541,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],
9542,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"And lo, as he grew ugly, gaunt,"
9543,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"And gnarled his way into a man,"
9544,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"What wisdom came to feed his want,"
9545,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],What worlds came near to let him scan!
9546,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],And as he fathomed through and through
9547,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Our dark and sorry human scheme,"
9548,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"He knew what Shakespeare never knew,"
9549,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],What Dante never dared to dream—
9550,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],That Men are one
9551,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Beneath the sun,"
9552,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],And before God are equal souls—
9553,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"This truth was his,"
9554,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],And this it is
9555,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],That round him such a glory rolls—
9556,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"For not alone he knew it as a truth,"
9557,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"He made it of his blood, and of his brain—"
9558,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],He crowned it on the day when piteous Booth
9559,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Sent a whole land to weeping with world pain—
9560,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],When a black cloud blotted the sun
9561,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"And men stopped in the streets to sob,"
9562,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],To think Old Abe was dead.
9563,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Dead, and the day’s work still undone,"
9564,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Dead, and war’s ruining heart athrob,"
9565,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],And earth with fields of carnage freshly spread—
9566,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Millions died fighting,"
9567,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],But in this man we mourned
9568,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Those millions, and one other—"
9569,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"And the States to-day uniting,"
9570,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"North and South,"
9571,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"East and West,"
9572,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],Speak with a people’s mouth
9573,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],A rhapsody of rest
9574,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"To him our beloved best,"
9575,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Our big, gaunt, homely brother—"
9576,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Our huge Atlantic coast-storm in a shawl,"
9577,THE LINCOLN CHILD[43],"Our cyclone in a smile—our President,"

9633,NIGHT NOTE,"Magazine of Verse_ since 1912, co-editing (with Harriet Monroe) _The"

9637,NIGHT NOTE,_The Spinning Woman of the Sky_ (1912) contains few hints of
9638,NIGHT NOTE,originality. It is cast in an entirely different key than Miss
9639,NIGHT NOTE,"Corbin’s later efforts. Her recent verses, many of them uncollected,"
9640,NIGHT NOTE,are much richer; they reveal a close contact with primitive people
9641,NIGHT NOTE,and native folk-lore. Her southern and far western sketches are
9642,NIGHT NOTE,"particularly colorful; a volume of New Mexico studies, _Red Earth_"
9643,NIGHT NOTE,"(1920), being full of noteworthy and sympathetic records."

9750,BETSY’S BOY,
9751,BETSY’S BOY,"Lola Ridge was born in Dublin, Ireland, leaving there in infancy and"
9752,BETSY’S BOY,"spending her childhood in Sydney, Australia. After living some years"
9753,BETSY’S BOY,"in New Zealand, she returned to Australia to study art. In 1907, she"
9754,BETSY’S BOY,"came to the United States, supporting herself for three years by"
9755,BETSY’S BOY,writing fiction for the popular magazines. She stopped this work
9756,BETSY’S BOY,"only, as she says, “because I found I would have to do so if I"
9757,BETSY’S BOY,wished to survive as an artist.” For several years she earned her
9758,BETSY’S BOY,living in a variety of ways—as organizer for an educational
9759,BETSY’S BOY,"movement, as advertisement writer, as illustrator, artist’s model,"
9760,BETSY’S BOY,"factory-worker, etc. In 1918, _The New Republic_ published her long"
9761,BETSY’S BOY,"poem _The Ghetto_ and Miss Ridge, until then totally unknown, became"
9762,BETSY’S BOY,the “discovery” of the year.
9763,BETSY’S BOY,
9764,BETSY’S BOY,Her volume _The Ghetto and Other Poems_ (1918) contains one poem
9765,BETSY’S BOY,"that is brilliant, several that are powerful and none that is"
9766,BETSY’S BOY,mediocre. Her title-poem is its pinnacle; in it Miss Ridge touches
9767,BETSY’S BOY,"strange heights. It is essentially a poem of the city, of its sodden"
9768,BETSY’S BOY,"brutalities, its sudden beauties. Swift figures shine from these"
9769,BETSY’S BOY,"lines, like barbaric colors leaping out of darkness; images that are"
9770,BETSY’S BOY,surprising but never strained glow with a condensed clarity. In her
9771,BETSY’S BOY,"other poems—especially in “The Song of Iron,” “Faces” and “Frank"
9772,BETSY’S BOY,"Little at Calvary”—the same dignity is maintained, though with less"
9773,BETSY’S BOY,magic.
9774,BETSY’S BOY,
9775,BETSY’S BOY,"_Sun-Up_ (1920) is less integrated, more frankly experimental. But"
9776,BETSY’S BOY,the same vibrancy and restrained power that distinguished her
9777,BETSY’S BOY,preceding book are manifest here. Her delineations are sensitive and
9778,BETSY’S BOY,subtle; she accomplishes the maximum in effects with a minimum of
9779,BETSY’S BOY,effort.

9993,IV,_Alfred Kreymborg_
9994,IV,
9995,IV,
9996,IV,"Alfred Kreymborg, one of the most original of the younger"
9997,IV,"insurgents, was born in New York City, December 10, 1883. His"
9998,IV,"education was spasmodic, his childhood being spent beneath the roar"
9999,IV,"of the elevated trains. At ten he was an expert chess player,"
10000,IV,"devoting practically all his time to a study of the game. Later, he"
10001,IV,"became a bookkeeper for a few years, but from the ages of seventeen"
10002,IV,to twenty-five he supported himself by teaching chess and playing
10003,IV,"exhibition games. His passion, however, was not mathematics but"
10004,IV,music. He dreamed of extending the borders of poetry into the realms
10005,IV,"of tonic art, experimented with new systems of notation,"
10006,IV,"technicalities of rhythm. At thirty, he began to turn to the theater"
10007,IV,"as a medium; finding, in this way, fresh contacts that enriched and"
10008,IV,ripened his later work.
10009,IV,
10010,IV,"In 1914, he organized that group of radical poets which,"
10011,IV,"half-deprecatingly, half-defiantly, called itself “Others.” (He"
10012,IV,"edited the three anthologies of their work published in 1916, 1917"
10013,IV,"and 1919.) Meanwhile, he had been working on a technique that was a"
10014,IV,fresh attempt to rid poetry of its too frequent wordiness and
10015,IV,rhetorical non-essentials. _Mushrooms_ (1916) was the first
10016,IV,collection in this vein. Here Kreymborg continually sought for
10017,IV,"simplification, cutting away at his lines until they assumed an"
10018,IV,"almost naked expression. Often he overdid his effects, attaining"
10019,IV,"nothing more than a false ingenuousness, a sophisticated simplicity."
10020,IV,"Often, too, he failed to draw the line between what is innocently"
10021,IV,childlike and what is merely childish. One sees him frequently
10022,IV,"trying to strike curious attitudes, tripping over several of his"
10023,IV,buffooneries and sprawling ingloriously.
10024,IV,
10025,IV,"But Kreymborg, for all harlequin gestures, can do something better"
10026,IV,than tumble and talk with his tongue in his cheek. An elfin fantasy
10027,IV,and no little beauty of thought are his when he wants to use them.
10028,IV,Surprising whimsicality and passages of bright color distinguish his
10029,IV,"_Plays for Poem-Mimes_ (1918), in which the principles of modern art"
10030,IV,"are applied to poetry and acting, as well as the more developed"
10031,IV,_Plays for Merry Andrews_ (1920).
10032,IV,
10033,IV,"Kreymborg’s most ambitious volume of poetry, _Blood of Things_"
10034,IV,"(1920), is, for all the surface oddities, the work not only of an"
10035,IV,"ardent experimenter but a serious thinker. Humor is in these pages,"
10036,IV,"but it is humor lifted to a sort of exaltation. Here, in spite of"
10037,IV,"what seems a persistence of occasional charlatanry, is a rich and"
10038,IV,sensitive imagination; a fancy that is as wild as it is
10039,IV,quick-witted.

10135,IMPROVISATION,_Arthur Davison Ficke_
10136,IMPROVISATION,
10137,IMPROVISATION,
10138,IMPROVISATION,"Arthur Davison Ficke was born at Davenport, Iowa, November 10, 1883."
10139,IMPROVISATION,"He received his A.B. at Harvard (1904), studied for the law and was"
10140,IMPROVISATION,"admitted to the bar in 1908. In 1919, after two years’ service in"
10141,IMPROVISATION,"France, he gave up his law practice and devoted himself to"
10142,IMPROVISATION,literature exclusively.
10143,IMPROVISATION,
10144,IMPROVISATION,"Ficke is the author of ten volumes of verse, the most representative"
10145,IMPROVISATION,"of which are _Sonnets of a Portrait Painter_ (1914), _The Man on the"
10146,IMPROVISATION,"Hilltop_ (1915) and _An April Elegy_ (1917). In these, the author"
10147,IMPROVISATION,"has distilled a warm spirituality, combining freshness of vision"
10148,IMPROVISATION,with an intensified seriousness.
10149,IMPROVISATION,
10150,IMPROVISATION,"Having been an expert collector and student of Japanese prints,"
10151,IMPROVISATION,Ficke has written two books on this theme. His intellectual
10152,IMPROVISATION,equipment is reinforced by a strong sense of satire. Writing under
10153,IMPROVISATION,"the pseudonym “Anne Knish,” he was one of the co-authors (with"
10154,IMPROVISATION,"Witter Bynner) of _Spectra_ (1916), which, caricaturing some of the"
10155,IMPROVISATION,"wilder outgrowths of the new poetry, was taken seriously by a"
10156,IMPROVISATION,majority of the critics and proved to be a brilliant hoax.

10364,THE COYOTE[45],_In Vivid Gardens_ (1911) is a mixture of original moods and
10365,THE COYOTE[45],derivative manners. The later _Bluestone_ (1920) is a much riper
10366,THE COYOTE[45],collection; a book of lyrics in which the author has made many
10367,THE COYOTE[45],experiments in the combination of rhythmical tunes and verbal music.

10463,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,
10464,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,
10465,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"Max Eastman was born at Canandaigua, New York, January 4, 1883. Both"
10466,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"his father and mother had been Congregationalist preachers, so it"
10467,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,was natural that the son should turn from scholasticism to a
10468,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,definitely social expression. Eastman had received his A.B. at
10469,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,Williams in 1905; from 1907 to 1911 he had been Associate in
10470,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"Philosophy at Columbia University. But in the latter part of 1911,"
10471,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"he devoted all his time to writing, studying the vast problems of"
10472,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,economic inequality and voicing the protests of the dumb millions in
10473,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"a style that was all the firmer for being philosophic. In 1913, he"
10474,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"became editor of _The Masses_ which, in 1917, became _The"
10475,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,Liberator_.
10476,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,
10477,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,_Child of the Amazons_ (1913) reveals the quiet lover of beauty as
10478,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"well as the fiery hater of injustice. The best of these poems, with"
10479,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"many new ones, were incorporated in _Colors of Life_ (1918). This"
10480,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"volume is a far richer collection; a record of glowing hours,"
10481,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,steadily burning truths.
10482,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,
10483,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"Besides Eastman’s poems and essays, he has written one of the most"
10484,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,clarifying—and most readable—studies of the period. _Enjoyment of
10485,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"Poetry_ (1913) is invaluable as a new kind of text-book, the chief"
10486,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"purpose of which, in the words of its preface, is to increase"
10487,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,enjoyment. Eliminating the usual academic and literary
10488,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,"classifications, Eastman accomplishes his object, which is to show"
10489,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,that the poetic in everyday perception and conversation should not
10490,A PHANTASY OF HEAVEN,be separated from the poetic in literature.

10567,AT THE AQUARIUM,"when he was eighteen years old. Even as a child, Giovannitti had"

10570,AT THE AQUARIUM,republic.” With the dream of America as the great liberator in his
10571,AT THE AQUARIUM,"heart, his first impressions were shattering. What he saw, through"
10572,AT THE AQUARIUM,"the eyes of the laborer, was the whiplash and legal trickery, the"
10573,AT THE AQUARIUM,"few ruling the many, the miseries and exploitation of the helpless."
10574,AT THE AQUARIUM,"He thought of becoming a preacher, attended theological school;"
10575,AT THE AQUARIUM,sought a greater outlet for his passion for democracy and became an

10776,THE DRUG CLERK,_Sara Teasdale_
10777,THE DRUG CLERK,
10778,THE DRUG CLERK,
10779,THE DRUG CLERK,"Sara Teasdale was born August 8, 1884, at St. Louis, Missouri, and"
10780,THE DRUG CLERK,"educated there. After leaving school, she traveled in Europe and the"
10781,THE DRUG CLERK,"Near East. In 1914, she married Ernst B. Filsinger, who has written"
10782,THE DRUG CLERK,"several books on foreign trade, and moved to New York City in 1916."
10783,THE DRUG CLERK,
10784,THE DRUG CLERK,"Her first book was a slight volume, _Sonnets to Duse_ (1907), giving"
10785,THE DRUG CLERK,little promise of the rich lyricism which was to follow. _Helen of
10786,THE DRUG CLERK,Troy and Other Poems_ (1911) contains the first hints of that
10787,THE DRUG CLERK,delicate craftsmanship and authentic loveliness which this poet has
10788,THE DRUG CLERK,brought to such a high pitch. The six monologues which open the
10789,THE DRUG CLERK,volume are splendid delineations written in a blank verse that is as
10790,THE DRUG CLERK,musical as many of her lyrics. At times it suffers from too
10791,THE DRUG CLERK,conscious a cleverness; the dexterity with which Miss Teasdale turns
10792,THE DRUG CLERK,a phrase or twists her last line is frequently too obtrusive to be
10793,THE DRUG CLERK,wholly enjoyable.
10794,THE DRUG CLERK,
10795,THE DRUG CLERK,"_Rivers to the Sea_ (1915) emphasizes this epigrammatic skill, but a"
10796,THE DRUG CLERK,"greater restraint is here, a warmer spontaneity. The new collection"
10797,THE DRUG CLERK,"contains at least a dozen unforgettable snatches, lyrics in which"
10798,THE DRUG CLERK,the words seem to fall into place without art or effort. Seldom
10799,THE DRUG CLERK,"employing metaphor or striking imagery, almost bare of ornament,"
10800,THE DRUG CLERK,these poems have the sheer magic of triumphant song. Theirs is an
10801,THE DRUG CLERK,artlessness that is more than an art.
10802,THE DRUG CLERK,
10803,THE DRUG CLERK,_Love Songs_ (1917) is a collection of Miss Teasdale’s previous
10804,THE DRUG CLERK,melodies for the _viola d’amore_ together with several new tunes.
10805,THE DRUG CLERK,The new poems emphasize the way in which this poet achieves a direct
10806,THE DRUG CLERK,enchantment without verbal subtleties. They also emphasize their
10807,THE DRUG CLERK,superiority to the earlier love lyrics that were written in a mood
10808,THE DRUG CLERK,"of literary romance, of artificial moonlit roses, languishing lutes,"
10809,THE DRUG CLERK,"balconies, passionate guitars—a mood that was not so much erotic as"
10810,THE DRUG CLERK,Pierrotic.
10811,THE DRUG CLERK,
10812,THE DRUG CLERK,_Flame and Shadow_ (1920) is by far the best of her books. Here the
10813,THE DRUG CLERK,beauty is fuller and deeper; an almost mystic radiance plays from
10814,THE DRUG CLERK,"these starry verses. Technically, also, this volume marks Miss"
10815,THE DRUG CLERK,Teasdale’s greatest advance. The words are chosen with a keener
10816,THE DRUG CLERK,sense of their actual as well as their musical values; the rhythms
10817,THE DRUG CLERK,are much more subtle and varied; the line moves with a greater
10818,THE DRUG CLERK,naturalness. Beneath the symbolism of poems like “Water Lilies” and
10819,THE DRUG CLERK,"“The Long Hill,” one is conscious of a finer artistry, a more"
10820,THE DRUG CLERK,flexible speech that is all the lovelier for its slight (and
10821,THE DRUG CLERK,logical) irregularities.
10822,THE DRUG CLERK,
10823,THE DRUG CLERK,"Besides her own books, Miss Teasdale has compiled an anthology, _The"
10824,THE DRUG CLERK,"Answering Voice_ (1917), comprising one hundred love lyrics by"
10825,THE DRUG CLERK,women.

10934,TIRED,_Gladys Cromwell_
10935,TIRED,
10936,TIRED,
10937,TIRED,"Gladys Cromwell was born November 28, 1885, in New York City. She"
10938,TIRED,was educated in New York private schools and lived abroad a great
10939,TIRED,"deal. “Her life,” writes Anne Dunn, “was little indented by outer"
10940,TIRED,"events, being wholly of the mind and spirit.” She was most at home"
10941,TIRED,"in the world within herself, sensitive and—to the final, tragic"
10942,TIRED,degree—self-effacing.
10943,TIRED,
10944,TIRED,"In January, 1918, Gladys and Dorothea, her twin-sister, enrolled in"
10945,TIRED,"the Canteen Service of the Red Cross, sailed for France and were"
10946,TIRED,stationed at Châlons. Both girls worked unremittingly for eight
10947,TIRED,months. It was only at the end of their desperate labors that they
10948,TIRED,"gave way to hopelessness, believing their efforts futile and the"
10949,TIRED,whole world desolate. Signs of a mental breakdown show in their
10950,TIRED,"diaries as early as October. “After the armistice,” writes Anne Dunn"
10951,TIRED,in her biographical note which serves as an appreciative epilogue to
10952,TIRED,"Gladys Cromwell’s _Poems_, “they showed symptoms of nervous"
10953,TIRED,prostration; but years of self-control and consideration for others
10954,TIRED,"made them conceal the black horror in which they lived, the agony"
10955,TIRED,"through which they saw a world which, they felt, contained no refuge"
10956,TIRED,"for beauty or quiet thought. And when, on their way home, they"
10957,TIRED,jumped from the deck of the _Lorraine_ it was in response to a
10958,TIRED,"vision that promised them fulfilment and peace.” After their death,"
10959,TIRED,"which occurred January 19, 1919, the French Government awarded the"
10960,TIRED,two sisters the Croix de Guerre.
10961,TIRED,
10962,TIRED,_Gates of Utterance_ (1915) has something more than the usual
10963,TIRED,“promise.” But the best of Miss Cromwell’s work can be found in her
10964,TIRED,"posthumously published _Poems_ (1919), which, in 1920, received the"
10965,TIRED,"yearly prize offered by the Poetry Society of America, dividing the"
10966,TIRED,honor with Neihardt’s _The Song of Three Friends_. Her most
10967,TIRED,significant poems betray that attitude to life which was at the
10968,TIRED,heart of her tragedy—a preoccupation that was a mixture of
10969,TIRED,"fascination and fear. Her lines, never mediocre, are introspective"
10970,TIRED,and fraught with serious concern—the work of a frailer and unsmiling
10971,TIRED,"Emily Dickinson. Several of the best of her delicate songs, like the"
10972,TIRED,"two lyrics quoted, tremble on the verge of greatness."

11017,THE MOULD[52],
11018,THE MOULD[52],
11019,THE MOULD[52],"Ezra (Loomis) Pound was born at Hailey, Idaho, October 30, 1885;"
11020,THE MOULD[52],attended Hamilton College and the University of Pennsylvania; and
11021,THE MOULD[52],"went abroad, seeking fresh material to complete a thesis on Lope de"
11022,THE MOULD[52],"Vega, in 1908. After visiting Spain on a roundabout journey to"
11023,THE MOULD[52],"England, where he took up his residence and where he has lived ever"
11024,THE MOULD[52],"since, Pound halted for a while in Italy. It was there, in Venice,"
11025,THE MOULD[52],"to be precise, that Pound’s first book, _A Lume Spento_ (1908), was"
11026,THE MOULD[52],printed. The following year Pound went to London and the chief poems
11027,THE MOULD[52],"of the little volume were incorporated in _Personæ_ (1909), a small"
11028,THE MOULD[52],collection containing some of Pound’s finest work.
11029,THE MOULD[52],
11030,THE MOULD[52],Although the young American was a total stranger to the English
11031,THE MOULD[52],"literary world, his book made a definite impression on critics of"
11032,THE MOULD[52],"all shades and tastes. Edward Thomas, one of the most careful"
11033,THE MOULD[52],"appraisers, wrote “the beauty of it is the beauty of passion,"
11034,THE MOULD[52],"sincerity and intensity, not of beautiful words and images and"
11035,THE MOULD[52],suggestions.... The thought dominates the words and is greater than
11036,THE MOULD[52],they are.” Another critic (Scott James) placed the chief emphasis on
11037,THE MOULD[52],"Pound’s metrical innovations, saying, “At first the whole thing may"
11038,THE MOULD[52],"seem to be mere madness and rhetoric, a vain exhibition of force and"
11039,THE MOULD[52],"passion without beauty. But as we read on, these curious meters seem"
11040,THE MOULD[52],to have a law and order of their own.”
11041,THE MOULD[52],
11042,THE MOULD[52],_Exultations_ (1909) was printed in the autumn of the same year that
11043,THE MOULD[52],saw the appearance of _Personæ_. It was received with even greater
11044,THE MOULD[52],cordiality; a new force and freedom were manifest in such poems as
11045,THE MOULD[52],"“Sestina: Altaforte,” “Ballad of the Goodly Fere,” “Francesca” and"
11046,THE MOULD[52],“Histrion.”
11047,THE MOULD[52],
11048,THE MOULD[52],In both of these books there was evident Pound’s erudition—a
11049,THE MOULD[52],"familiarity with mediæval literature, Provençal singers, Troubadour"
11050,THE MOULD[52],"ballads—that, later on, was to degenerate into pedantry and become"
11051,THE MOULD[52],"hard and dry. Too often in his later work, Pound seems to be more"
11052,THE MOULD[52],"the archaeologist than the artist, digging with little energy and"
11053,THE MOULD[52],less enthusiasm. _Canzoni_ (1911) and _Ripostes_ (1912) both contain
11054,THE MOULD[52],much that is sharp and living; they also contain the germs of
11055,THE MOULD[52],desiccation and decay. Pound began to scatter his talents; to start
11056,THE MOULD[52],movements which he quickly discarded for new ones; to spend himself
11057,THE MOULD[52],in poetic propaganda for the Imagists and others (see Preface); to
11058,THE MOULD[52],give more and more time to translation (_The Sonnets of Guido
11059,THE MOULD[52],Cavalcanti_ appeared in 1912) and arrangements from the Chinese
11060,THE MOULD[52],"(_Cathay_, paraphrased from the notes of Ernest Fenollosa, was"
11061,THE MOULD[52],"issued in 1915); to lay the chief stress on _technique_, shades of"
11062,THE MOULD[52],"color, verbal _nuances_. The result was a lassitude of the creative"
11063,THE MOULD[52],"faculties, an impoverishment of emotion. In the later books, Pound"
11064,THE MOULD[52],begins to suffer from a decadence which appraises the values in life
11065,THE MOULD[52],chiefly as æsthetic values. And this decadence expresses itself in a
11066,THE MOULD[52],"weariness, a sterility of the imagination. Real feeling becomes"
11067,THE MOULD[52],"rarer in his work and the poet descends to flashy trivialities,"
11068,THE MOULD[52],vagaries of assertion or sheer _bravado_ of expression—wasting much
11069,THE MOULD[52],of his gift in a mere tilting at convention.
11070,THE MOULD[52],
11071,THE MOULD[52],"But though this is true of a great quantity of his recent work,"
11072,THE MOULD[52],"though he often seems a living anachronism, drawing life not from"
11073,THE MOULD[52],"life itself but only from books, many of the poems in _Lustra_"
11074,THE MOULD[52],(1917) yield a hard brightness. The influence of Browning and the
11075,THE MOULD[52],pre-Raphaelites is less pronounced and reflections of his earlier
11076,THE MOULD[52],energy stand out with a peculiar brilliance.
11077,THE MOULD[52],
11078,THE MOULD[52],"Too special to achieve permanence, too intellectual to become"
11079,THE MOULD[52],"popular, Pound’s contribution to his age should not be"
11080,THE MOULD[52],underestimated. He was a pioneer in the new forms; he fought
11081,THE MOULD[52],dullness wherever he encountered it; under his leadership the
11082,THE MOULD[52],Imagists became not only a group but a protest; he helped to make
11083,THE MOULD[52],many of the paths which a score of unconsciously influenced poets
11084,THE MOULD[52],tread with such ease and nonchalance. Much of his poetry
11085,THE MOULD[52],"gesticulates instead of speaking, a great portion of his art is"
11086,THE MOULD[52],"poetry in pantomime. And yet, without Pound, American poetry would"
11087,THE MOULD[52],"scarcely have been the many-voiced, multi-colored thing that it is."

11178,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,_Louis Untermeyer_
11179,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,
11180,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,
11181,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"Louis Untermeyer was born October 1, 1885, in New York City, where"
11182,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"he has lived, except for brief sojourns in Maine and New Jersey,"
11183,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,ever since. His education was sketchy; his continued failure to
11184,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,comprehend algebra and geometry kept him from entering college. His
11185,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,one ambition was to become a composer. At sixteen he appeared as a
11186,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,pianist in semi-professional circles; at seventeen he entered his
11187,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"father’s jewelry manufacturing establishment, of which he became"
11188,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,designer and factory manager.
11189,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,
11190,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"Untermeyer’s first volume was _The Younger Quire_ (1911), a"
11191,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,twenty-four-page burlesque of an anthology (_The Younger Choir_). It
11192,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,was issued anonymously and only one hundred copies were printed.
11193,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"Later in the same year, he published a sequence of some seventy"
11194,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,lyrics entitled _First Love_ (1911) in which the influences of
11195,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"Heine, Henley and Housman were not only obvious but crippling. With"
11196,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"the exception of about eight of these songs, the volume is devoid of"
11197,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"character and, in spite of a certain technical facility, wholly"
11198,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,undistinguished.
11199,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,
11200,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"It was with _Challenge_ (1914), now in its fourth edition, that the"
11201,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,author first spoke in his own idiom. Although the ghost of Henley
11202,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"still haunts some of these pages, poems like “Summons,” “Landscapes”"
11203,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,and “Caliban in the Coal Mines” show “a fresh and lyrical sympathy
11204,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,with the modern world.... His vision” (thus the Boston _Transcript_)
11205,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"“is a social vision, his spirit a passionately energized command of"
11206,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,the forces of justice.”
11207,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,
11208,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"_Challenge_ was succeeded by _These Times_ (1917), evidently an"
11209,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"“interval” book which, lacking the concentration and unity of the"
11210,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"better known collection, sought (not always successfully) for larger"
11211,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"horizons. Certain poems (like “Swimmers,” “The Laughers” and the"
11212,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"colloquial sonnets) stand out, but as a whole it has neither the"
11213,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,energy of his earlier nor the surety of his later work. _The New
11214,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,Adam_ (1920) is a more satisfactory unit; here the varied passions
11215,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,are fused in a new heat.
11216,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,
11217,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"Besides this serious poetry, Untermeyer has published two volumes of"
11218,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"critical parodies, “_—— and Other Poets_” (1917) and _Including"
11219,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,Horace_ (1919)—paraphrases of the Latin bard as various classic and
11220,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,modern poets might have rendered him. He has also printed a strict
11221,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,metrical translation of three hundred and twenty-five _Poems of
11222,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,"Heinrich Heine_ (1917); a volume of prose criticism, _The New Era in"
11223,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,American Poetry_ (1919); and two text-books. He was one of the
11224,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,Associate Editors of _The Seven Arts_ (1916-17) and has lectured at
11225,IN A STATION OF THE METRO,various universities in the Eastern States.

11404,A SIDE STREET,
11405,A SIDE STREET,On the warm Sunday afternoons
11406,A SIDE STREET,And every evening in the Spring and Summer
11407,A SIDE STREET,When the night hurries the late home-comer
11408,A SIDE STREET,"And the air grows softer, and scraps of tunes"
11409,A SIDE STREET,Float from the open windows and jar
11410,A SIDE STREET,Against the voices of children and the hum of a car;
11411,A SIDE STREET,
11412,A SIDE STREET,When the city noises commingle and melt
11413,A SIDE STREET,"With a restless something half-seen, half-felt—"
11414,A SIDE STREET,"I see them always there,"
11415,A SIDE STREET,"Upon the low, smooth wall before the church;"
11416,A SIDE STREET,That row of little girls who sit and stare
11417,A SIDE STREET,Like sparrows on a granite perch.
11418,A SIDE STREET,They come in twittering couples or walk alone
11419,A SIDE STREET,"To their gray bough of stone,"
11420,A SIDE STREET,"Sometimes by twos and threes, sometimes as many as five—"
11421,A SIDE STREET,But always they sit there on the narrow coping
11422,A SIDE STREET,"Bright-eyed and solemn, scarcely hoping"
11423,A SIDE STREET,To see more than what is merely moving and alive....
11424,A SIDE STREET,They hear the couples pass; the lisp of happy feet
11425,A SIDE STREET,Increases and the night grows suddenly sweet....
11426,A SIDE STREET,
11427,A SIDE STREET,Before the quiet church that smells of death
11428,A SIDE STREET,They sit.
11429,A SIDE STREET,And Life sweeps past them with a rushing breath
11430,A SIDE STREET,And reaches out and plucks them by the hand
11431,A SIDE STREET,"And calls them boldly, whispering to each"
11432,A SIDE STREET,In some strange speech
11433,A SIDE STREET,They tremble to but cannot understand.
11434,A SIDE STREET,"It thrills and troubles them, as one by one,"
11435,A SIDE STREET,The days run off like water through a sieve;
11436,A SIDE STREET,"While, with a gaze as candid as the sun,"
11437,A SIDE STREET,"Poignant and puzzled and inquisitive,"
11438,A SIDE STREET,"They come and sit,—"
11439,A SIDE STREET,A part of life and yet apart from it.

11444,A SIDE STREET,_Jean Starr Untermeyer_
11445,A SIDE STREET,
11446,A SIDE STREET,
11447,A SIDE STREET,"Jean Starr was born at Zanesville, Ohio, May 13, 1886, and educated"
11448,A SIDE STREET,"at the Putnam Seminary in the city of her birth. At sixteen, she"
11449,A SIDE STREET,"came to New York City, pursuing special studies at Columbia. In 1907"
11450,A SIDE STREET,"she married Louis Untermeyer and, although she had written some"
11451,A SIDE STREET,"prose previous to the poetic renascence, her first volume was"
11452,A SIDE STREET,published more than ten years later.
11453,A SIDE STREET,
11454,A SIDE STREET,"_Growing Pains_ (1918) is a thin book of thirty-four poems, the"
11455,A SIDE STREET,result of eight years slow and self-critical creation. This careful
11456,A SIDE STREET,and highly selective process does much to bring the volume up to an
11457,A SIDE STREET,unusually high level; a severity of taste and standards maintain the
11458,A SIDE STREET,poet on the same austere plane. Perfection is almost a passion with
11459,A SIDE STREET,her; the first poem in the book declares:
11460,A SIDE STREET,
11461,A SIDE STREET,I would rather work in stubborn rock
11462,A SIDE STREET,All the years of my life;
11463,A SIDE STREET,And make one strong thing
11464,A SIDE STREET,"And set it in a high, clean place,"
11465,A SIDE STREET,To recall the granite strength of my desire.
11466,A SIDE STREET,
11467,A SIDE STREET,"Acutely self-analytical, there is a stern, uncompromising"
11468,A SIDE STREET,relentlessness toward her introspections that keeps them from being
11469,A SIDE STREET,"wistful or pathetic. These poems are, as she explains in her"
11470,A SIDE STREET,title-poem—
11471,A SIDE STREET,
11472,A SIDE STREET,"No songs for an idle lute,"
11473,A SIDE STREET,"No pretty tunes of coddled ills,"
11474,A SIDE STREET,But the bare chart of my growing pains.
11475,A SIDE STREET,
11476,A SIDE STREET,"Intellect is always in the ascendency, even in the most ecstatic"
11477,A SIDE STREET,"verses. In an almost religious poem, “A Man” (dedicated to her"
11478,A SIDE STREET,"father), she pictures herself as a child, and expresses the whole"
11479,A SIDE STREET,psychology of our juvenile love of poor literature in lines like:
11480,A SIDE STREET,
11481,A SIDE STREET,"A book held gaping on my knees,"
11482,A SIDE STREET,Watering a sterile romance with my thoughts.
11483,A SIDE STREET,
11484,A SIDE STREET,But it is not only her keen search for truth and an equally keen eye
11485,A SIDE STREET,for the exact word that make these poems distinctive. A sharp color
11486,A SIDE STREET,"sense, a surprising whimsicality, a translation of the ordinary in"
11487,A SIDE STREET,"terms of the beautiful, illumine such poems as “Sinfonia Domestica,”"
11488,A SIDE STREET,"“Clothes,” “Autumn.” In the last named, with its brilliant"
11489,A SIDE STREET,"combination of painting and housewifery, Mrs. Untermeyer has"
11490,A SIDE STREET,reproduced her early environment with a bright pungency;
11491,A SIDE STREET,"“Verhaeren’s Flemish _genre_ pictures are no better,” writes Amy"
11492,A SIDE STREET,Lowell. Several of her purely pictorial poems establish a swift
11493,A SIDE STREET,kinship between the most romantic and most prosaic objects. The tiny
11494,A SIDE STREET,"“Moonrise” is an example; so is “High Tide,” that, in one extended"
11495,A SIDE STREET,"metaphor, turns the mere fact of a physical law into a most"
11496,A SIDE STREET,arresting and noble fancy.
11497,A SIDE STREET,
11498,A SIDE STREET,_Dreams Out of Darkness_ (1921) is a ripening of this author’s
11499,A SIDE STREET,powers with a richer musical undercurrent. This increase of melody
11500,A SIDE STREET,"is manifest on every page, possibly most striking in “Lake Song,”"
11501,A SIDE STREET,"which, beneath its symbolism, is one of the most liquid unrhymed"
11502,A SIDE STREET,lyrics of the period.

11512,HIGH TIDE,Sprang—but were drawn back slowly

11516,HIGH TIDE,Then I saw who held them captive;

11628,LAKE SONG,_John Gould Fletcher_
11629,LAKE SONG,
11630,LAKE SONG,
11631,LAKE SONG,"John Gould Fletcher was born at Little Rock, Arkansas, January 3,"
11632,LAKE SONG,"1886. He was educated at Phillips Academy (Andover, Massachusetts)"
11633,LAKE SONG,"and Harvard (1903-7) and, after spending several years in"
11634,LAKE SONG,"Massachusetts, moved to England, where, except for brief visits to"
11635,LAKE SONG,"the United States, he has lived ever since."
11636,LAKE SONG,
11637,LAKE SONG,"In 1913, Fletcher published five tiny books of poems which he has"
11638,LAKE SONG,"referred to as “his literary wild oats,” five small collections of"
11639,LAKE SONG,"experimental and faintly interesting verse. Two years later,"
11640,LAKE SONG,Fletcher appeared as a decidedly less conservative and far more
11641,LAKE SONG,arresting poet with _Irradiations—Sand and Spray_ (1915). This
11642,LAKE SONG,volume is full of an extraordinary fancy; imagination riots through
11643,LAKE SONG,"it, even though it is often a bloodless and bodiless imagination. It"
11644,LAKE SONG,"is crowded—even overcrowded—with æsthetic subtleties, a sort of"
11645,LAKE SONG,brilliant and haphazard series of improvisations.
11646,LAKE SONG,
11647,LAKE SONG,"In the following book, _Goblins and Pagodas_ (1916), Fletcher"
11648,LAKE SONG,carries his unrelated harmonies much further. Color dominates him;
11649,LAKE SONG,the ambitious set of eleven “color symphonies” is an elaborate
11650,LAKE SONG,design in which the tone as well as the thought is summoned by
11651,LAKE SONG,"color-associations, sometimes closely related, sometimes"
11652,LAKE SONG,"far-fetched, “It contains,” says Conrad Aiken in his appreciative"
11653,LAKE SONG,"chapter on Fletcher in _Scepticisms_, “little of the emotion which"
11654,LAKE SONG,relates to the daily life of men and women.... It is a sort of
11655,LAKE SONG,"absolute poetry, a poetry of detached waver and brilliance, a"
11656,LAKE SONG,"beautiful flowering of language alone—a parthenogenesis, as if"
11657,LAKE SONG,language were fertilized by itself rather than by thought or
11658,LAKE SONG,feeling. Remove the magic of phrase and sound and there is nothing
11659,LAKE SONG,"left: no thread of continuity, no thought, no story, no emotion. But"
11660,LAKE SONG,"the magic of phrase and sound is powerful, and it takes one into a"
11661,LAKE SONG,fantastic world.”
11662,LAKE SONG,
11663,LAKE SONG,"Meanwhile, Fletcher has been developing. After having appeared in"
11664,LAKE SONG,"the three Imagist anthologies, he sought for depths rather than"
11665,LAKE SONG,"surfaces. Beginning with his majestic “Lincoln,” his work has had a"
11666,LAKE SONG,closer relation to humanity; a moving mysticism speaks from _The
11667,LAKE SONG,"Tree of Life_ (1918), the more obviously native _Granite and"
11668,LAKE SONG,Breakers_ (1921) and the later uncollected poems. Although the
11669,LAKE SONG,"unconscious too often dictates Fletcher’s fantasies, a calm music"
11670,LAKE SONG,"dominates his shorter poems, a grave and subdued lyricism moves and"
11671,LAKE SONG,enriches them.

11873,“_H. D._”,"Pennsylvania. When she was still a child, her father became Director"
11874,“_H. D._”,of the Flower Observatory and the family moved to a suburb in the
11875,“_H. D._”,outskirts of Philadelphia. Hilda Doolittle attended a private school
11876,“_H. D._”,in West Philadelphia; entered Bryn Mawr College in 1904; and went
11877,“_H. D._”,"abroad, for what was intended to be a short sojourn, in 1911. After"
11878,“_H. D._”,"a visit to Italy and France, she came to London, joining Ezra Pound"
11879,“_H. D._”,and helping to organize the Imagists. Her work (signed “H. D.”)
11880,“_H. D._”,began to appear in a few magazines and its unusual quality was
11881,“_H. D._”,recognized at once. She married one of the most talented of the
11882,“_H. D._”,English members of this group (Richard Aldington) in 1913 and
11883,“_H. D._”,"remained in London, creating, through a chiseled verse, her pure and"
11884,“_H. D._”,"flawless reproductions of Greek poetry and sculpture. In 1920, she"
11885,“_H. D._”,"made her long-deferred visit to America, settling on the Californian"
11886,“_H. D._”,"coast, returning, the following year, to England."
11887,“_H. D._”,
11888,“_H. D._”,"“H. D.” is, by all odds, the most important of her group. She is the"
11889,“_H. D._”,only one who has steadfastly held to the letter as well as the
11890,“_H. D._”,"spirit of its _credo_. She is, in fact, the only true Imagist. Her"
11891,“_H. D._”,"poems, capturing the firm delicacy of the Greek models, are like a"
11892,“_H. D._”,"set of Tanagra figurines. Here, at first glance, the effect is"
11893,“_H. D._”,chilling—beauty seems held in a frozen gesture. But it is in this
11894,“_H. D._”,"very fixation of light, color and emotion that she achieves"
11895,“_H. D._”,"intensity. What, at first, seemed static becomes fluent; the"
11896,“_H. D._”,arrested moment glows with brimming energy.
11897,“_H. D._”,

11987,LETHE,_William Rose Benét_
11988,LETHE,
11989,LETHE,
11990,LETHE,"William Rose Benét was born at Fort Hamilton, New York Harbor,"
11991,LETHE,"February 2, 1886. He was educated at Albany Academy and graduated"
11992,LETHE,"from Yale in 1907. After various experiences as free-lance writer,"
11993,LETHE,"publisher’s reader, magazine editor and second lieutenant in the U."
11994,LETHE,"S. Air Service, Benét became the Associate Editor of the New York"
11995,LETHE,Post’s _Literary Review_ in 1920.
11996,LETHE,
11997,LETHE,The outstanding feature of Benét’s verse is its extraordinary
11998,LETHE,whimsicality; an oriental imagination riots through his pages. Like
11999,LETHE,"the title-poem of his first volume, _Merchants from Cathay_ (1913),"
12000,LETHE,all of Benét’s volumes vibrate with a vigorous music; they are full
12001,LETHE,of the sonorous stuff that one rolls out crossing wintry fields or
12002,LETHE,tramping a road alone.
12003,LETHE,
12004,LETHE,But Benét’s charm is not confined to the lift and swing of
12005,LETHE,"rollicking choruses. His _The Falconer of God_ (1914), _The Great"
12006,LETHE,White Wall_ (1916) and _The Burglar of the Zodiac_ (1918) contain
12007,LETHE,decorations as bold as they are brilliant; they ring with a strange
12008,LETHE,and spicy music evoked from seemingly casual words; they glow with a
12009,LETHE,"half-lurid, half-humorous reflection of the grotesque. There are"
12010,LETHE,times when Benét seems to be forcing his ingenuity. The poet
12011,LETHE,"frequently lets his fantastic Pegasus run away with him, and what"
12012,LETHE,started out to be a gallop among the stars ends in a scraping of
12013,LETHE,shins on the pavement. But he is saved by an acrobatic dexterity
12014,LETHE,even when his energy betrays him.
12015,LETHE,
12016,LETHE,_Moons of Grandeur_ (1920) represents the fullest development of
12017,LETHE,Benét’s unusual gifts; a combination of Eastern phantasy and Western
12018,LETHE,vigor.

12192,ADDENDUM,_John Hall Wheelock_
12193,ADDENDUM,
12194,ADDENDUM,
12195,ADDENDUM,"John Hall Wheelock was born at Far Rockaway, Long Island, in 1886."
12196,ADDENDUM,"He was graduated from Harvard, receiving his B.A. in 1908, and"
12197,ADDENDUM,"finished his studies at the Universities of Göttingen and Berlin,"
12198,ADDENDUM,1908-10.
12199,ADDENDUM,
12200,ADDENDUM,"Wheelock’s first book is, in many respects, his best. _The Human"
12201,ADDENDUM,Fantasy_ (1911) sings with the voice of youth—a youth which is
12202,ADDENDUM,"vibrantly, even vociferously, in love with existence. Rhapsodic and"
12203,ADDENDUM,"obviously influenced by Whitman and Henley, these lines beat"
12204,ADDENDUM,bravely; a singing buoyance arrests one upon opening the volume. A
12205,ADDENDUM,headlong ecstasy rises from pages whose refrain is “Splendid it is
12206,ADDENDUM,to live and glorious to die.” _The Beloved Adventure_ (1912) is less
12207,ADDENDUM,powerful but scarcely less passionate. Lyric after lyric moves one
12208,ADDENDUM,by its athletic music and spiritual intensity.
12209,ADDENDUM,
12210,ADDENDUM,Wheelock’s subsequent volumes are less individualized. _Love and
12211,ADDENDUM,Liberation_ (1913) and _Dust and Light_ (1919) are long dilutions of
12212,ADDENDUM,"the earlier strain. The music is still here, but most of the magic"
12213,ADDENDUM,has gone. Wheelock has allowed himself to be exploited by his own
12214,ADDENDUM,"fluency, and the result is unbelievably monotonous. Yet even vast"
12215,ADDENDUM,stretches of two hundred and thirty unvaried love songs cannot bury
12216,ADDENDUM,"a dozen or more vivid poems which lie, half-concealed, in a waste of"
12217,ADDENDUM,verbiage.
12218,ADDENDUM,
12219,ADDENDUM,"In spite of his lapses and lack of selective taste, Wheelock is"
12220,ADDENDUM,often a stirring lyricist. _The Human Fantasy_ is one of the most
12221,ADDENDUM,remarkable “first” books of the period.

12291,NIRVANA,_Joyce Kilmer_
12292,NIRVANA,
12293,NIRVANA,
12294,NIRVANA,"(Alfred) Joyce Kilmer was born at New Brunswick, New Jersey,"
12295,NIRVANA,"December 6, 1886. He was graduated from Rutgers College in 1904 and"
12296,NIRVANA,received his A.B. from Columbia in 1906. After leaving Columbia he
12297,NIRVANA,"became, in rapid succession, instructor of Latin at Morristown High"
12298,NIRVANA,"School, editor of a journal for horsemen, book salesman,"
12299,NIRVANA,"book-reviewer, lexicographer, æsthete, interviewer, socialist and"
12300,NIRVANA,churchman.
12301,NIRVANA,
12302,NIRVANA,"After Kilmer became converted to Catholicism, his conception of the"
12303,NIRVANA,"church was the Church Militant. “His thought,” writes his"
12304,NIRVANA,"biographer, Robert Cortes Holliday, “dwelt continually on"
12305,NIRVANA,"warrior-saints.... As he saw it, there was no question as to his"
12306,NIRVANA,"duty.” In 1917 Kilmer joined the Officers’ Reserve Training Corps,"
12307,NIRVANA,but he soon resigned from this. In less than three weeks after
12308,NIRVANA,"America entered the world war, he enlisted as a private in the"
12309,NIRVANA,"Seventh Regiment, National Guard, New York. Shortly before the"
12310,NIRVANA,"regiment left New York for Spartanburg, South Carolina, Kilmer was"
12311,NIRVANA,transferred at his own request to the 165th Infantry. In spite of
12312,NIRVANA,"his avowed militancy, Kilmer was “a poet trying to be a soldier;” he"
12313,NIRVANA,made no effort to glorify war; his one hope was to wring some
12314,NIRVANA,spiritual satisfaction out of the brutality.
12315,NIRVANA,
12316,NIRVANA,"On July 28, 1918, the five-day battle for the mastery of the heights"
12317,NIRVANA,"beyond the river Ourcq was begun. Two days later, Sergeant Kilmer"
12318,NIRVANA,was killed in action.
12319,NIRVANA,
12320,NIRVANA,Death came before the poet had developed or even matured his gifts.
12321,NIRVANA,"His first volume, _Summer of Love_ (1911), is wholly imitative; it"
12322,NIRVANA,"is full of reflections of a dozen other sources, “a broken bundle of"
12323,NIRVANA,mirrors.” _Trees and Other Poems_ (1914) contains the title-poem by
12324,NIRVANA,"which Kilmer is best known and, though various influences are still"
12325,NIRVANA,"strong (one cannot miss the borrowed accents of Patmore, Belloc,"
12326,NIRVANA,"Chesterton, Housman and—_vide_ “Martin”—E. A. Robinson), a"
12327,NIRVANA,refreshing candor lights up the lines. _Main Street and Other Poems_
12328,NIRVANA,"(1917) is less derivative; the simplicity is less self-conscious,"
12329,NIRVANA,the ecstasy more spontaneous.
12330,NIRVANA,
12331,NIRVANA,"Besides his own poetry, Kilmer edited a selection of _Verses_ by"
12332,NIRVANA,"Hilaire Belloc (1916) and _Dreams and Images_, An Anthology of"
12333,NIRVANA,Catholic poets (1917).

12415,MARTIN[56],"O Sheel’s two volumes, _The Blossomy Bough_ (1911) and _The Light"
12416,MARTIN[56],"Feet of Goats_ (1915), owe their chief impetus to the Celtic"
12417,MARTIN[56],"renascence and to W. B. Yeats in particular. But O Sheel’s poetry,"
12418,MARTIN[56],"although influenced, is not merely derivative. His ancestry speaks"

12565,OLD SHIPS,
12566,OLD SHIPS,_Asphalt and Other Poems_ (1917) is a queer mixture. Cheap stanzas
12567,OLD SHIPS,crowd against lines of singular beauty; poor dialect verse elbows
12568,OLD SHIPS,lyrics that sing without a false note. The same incongruity is
12569,OLD SHIPS,"evident in _Black Branches_ (1920), where much that is strained and"
12570,OLD SHIPS,artificial mingles with poetry that is not only spontaneous but

12623,LITTLE THINGS,"Schauffler, the author, in August, 1919."
12624,LITTLE THINGS,
12625,LITTLE THINGS,Miss Widdemer’s poetic work has two distinct phases. In the one

12627,LITTLE THINGS,"the lyricist on fire with angry passion. In the other, she is the"
12628,LITTLE THINGS,"writer of well-made, polite and popular sentimental verse. Her"
12629,LITTLE THINGS,"finest poems are in _Factories with Other Lyrics_ (1915), although"
12630,LITTLE THINGS,"several of her best songs are in _The Old Road to Paradise_ (1918),"

12708,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,
12709,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"Alan Seeger was born in New York, June 22, 1888. When he was still a"
12710,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"baby, his parents moved to Staten Island, where he remained through"
12711,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"boyhood. Later, there were several other migrations, including a"
12712,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"sojourn in Mexico, where Seeger spent the most impressionable years"
12713,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"of his youth. In 1906, he entered Harvard; became one of the editors"
12714,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,of the _Harvard Monthly_; returned to New York in 1910 and in 1913
12715,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"set off for Paris—“a departing point,” wrote William Archer, “which"
12716,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"may fairly be called his Hegira, the turning point of his history.”"
12717,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"1914 came, and the European war had not entered its third week when,"
12718,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"along with some forty of his fellow-countrymen, Seeger enlisted in"
12719,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"the Foreign Legion of France. He was in action almost continually,"
12720,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"serving on various fronts. On July 1, 1916, a new advance began; a"
12721,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,few days later the Legion was ordered to clear the Germans out of
12722,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"the village of Belloy-en-Santerre. On the fourth of July, Seeger"
12723,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,advanced in the first rush and his squad was practically wiped out
12724,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"by hidden machine-gun fire. Seeger fell, mortally wounded, and died"
12725,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,the next morning.
12726,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,
12727,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,Seeger’s literary promise was far greater than his poetic
12728,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"accomplishment. With the exception of his one famous poem, there is"
12729,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,little of importance though much of charm in his collected _Poems_
12730,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"(published, with an Introduction by William Archer, in 1916). His"
12731,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,letters from the front (published in 1917) show a more powerful
12732,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,"touch, a keener sense of perception. Had he lived a few years more,"
12733,THE MODERN WOMAN TO HER LOVER,he might have been a valuable recorder of a changed and changing

12825,CREEDS,"Thomas Stearns Eliot, one of the most brilliant of the young"
12826,CREEDS,"expatriates, was born at St. Louis, Missouri, in 1888. He received"
12827,CREEDS,"his A.B. at Harvard in 1909 and his A.M. in 1910. Subsequently, he"
12828,CREEDS,"studied at the Sorbonne and at Merton College, Oxford, becoming a"
12829,CREEDS,"teacher and lecturer in London, where he has lived since 1913."
12830,CREEDS,
12831,CREEDS,"_Prufrock_ appeared in England in 1917. An American edition,"
12832,CREEDS,"including a number of other verses, was published under the title"
12833,CREEDS,_Poems_ in 1920. Eliot’s early work is the more important; it is
12834,CREEDS,curious and sharply original. The exaltation which is the very
12835,CREEDS,breath of poetry is seldom present in Eliot’s later lines. A certain
12836,CREEDS,"perverse brilliance takes its place, an unearthly light without"
12837,CREEDS,warmth which has the sparkle if not the strength of fire. It
12838,CREEDS,flickers mockingly through most of Eliot’s sardonic pictures and
12839,CREEDS,shines with a bright pallor out of “The Love Song of J. Alfred
12840,CREEDS,Prufrock” and “Portrait of a Lady.” These two long poems are the
12841,CREEDS,book’s main exhibit; they are sensitive and psychologically probing.
12842,CREEDS,
12843,CREEDS,"Eliot’s ironic rhymed verses, which constitute the bulk of his work,"
12844,CREEDS,are in his later style. It is this vein that tempts Eliot most—and
12845,CREEDS,"is his own undoing. For irony, no matter how agile and erudite—and"
12846,CREEDS,Eliot’s is both—must contain heat if it is to burn. And heat is one
12847,CREEDS,of the few things that cannot be juggled by this acrobatic satirist.

12885,PRELUDE,The grimy scraps
12886,PRELUDE,Of withered leaves about his feet

12888,PRELUDE,The showers beat
12889,PRELUDE,"On broken blinds and chimney pots,"

12897,PRELUDE,_Conrad Aiken_
12898,PRELUDE,
12899,PRELUDE,
12900,PRELUDE,"Conrad (Potter) Aiken was born at Savannah, Georgia, August 5, 1889."
12901,PRELUDE,"He attended Harvard, receiving his A.B. in 1912, travelled"
12902,PRELUDE,"extensively for three years, and since then, he has devoted all his"
12903,PRELUDE,"time to literature, living at South Yarmouth, Massachusetts."
12904,PRELUDE,
12905,PRELUDE,The most outstanding feature of Aiken’s creative work is its rapid
12906,PRELUDE,"adaptability and its slow growth. His first volume, _Earth"
12907,PRELUDE,"Triumphant and Other Tales in Verse_ (1914), is the Keats tradition"
12908,PRELUDE,"crossed, paraphrased (and vulgarized) by Masefield. _Turns and"
12909,PRELUDE,Movies_ (1916) is a complete change; Masefield is exchanged for
12910,PRELUDE,"Masters. But in the less conspicuous half of this book, Aiken begins"
12911,PRELUDE,"to speak with his true voice. Here he is the natural musician,"
12912,PRELUDE,"playing with new rhythms, haunting cadences. _The Jig of Forslin_"
12913,PRELUDE,"(1916) is an elaboration of his method. In this volume, Aiken goes"
12914,PRELUDE,"back to the narrative—or rather, to a series of loosely connected"
12915,PRELUDE,"stories—and, reinforced by studies in analytical psychology,"
12916,PRELUDE,explores “the process of vicarious wish fulfilment by which
12917,PRELUDE,civilized man enriches his circumscribed life.”
12918,PRELUDE,
12919,PRELUDE,"_Nocturne of Remembered Spring_ (1917), _The Charnel Rose_ (1918)"
12920,PRELUDE,and _The House of Dust_ (1920) are packed with a tired but often
12921,PRELUDE,beautiful music. Even though much of it is enlivened by injections
12922,PRELUDE,"of T. S. Eliot’s conversational idiom, the effect is often moony and"
12923,PRELUDE,monotonous. Rain seems to fall persistently through these volumes;
12924,PRELUDE,"dust blows down the street, the shadows blur; everything dissolves"
12925,PRELUDE,in a mist of boredom and forgetfulness. Even the poignance seems on
12926,PRELUDE,the point of falling asleep.
12927,PRELUDE,
12928,PRELUDE,Often Aiken loses himself in this watery welter of language. In
12929,PRELUDE,"trying to create a closer _liaison_ between poetry and music, he"
12930,PRELUDE,"gives, too frequently, so much importance to the rise and fall of"
12931,PRELUDE,syllables that his very excess of music defeats his purpose. His
12932,PRELUDE,"verse, thus, gains greatly on the sensuous side but loses, in its"
12933,PRELUDE,"cloying indefiniteness, that vitality and sharpness of speech which"
12934,PRELUDE,is the very blood of poetry.
12935,PRELUDE,
12936,PRELUDE,This weakening overinsistence on sound does not prevent Aiken from
12937,PRELUDE,"attaining many exquisite effects. Primarily, a lyric poet, he"
12938,PRELUDE,frequently condenses an emotion in a few lines; some of his best
12939,PRELUDE,moments are these “lapses” into tune. The music of the Morning Song
12940,PRELUDE,from “Senlin” (in _The Charnel Rose_) is rich with subtleties of
12941,PRELUDE,rhythm. But it is much more than a lyrical movement. Beneath the
12942,PRELUDE,"flow and flexibility of these lines, there is a delightful"
12943,PRELUDE,"whimsicality, an extraordinary summoning of the immensities that"
12944,PRELUDE,loom behind the casual moments of everyday. And in “The Fulfilled
12945,PRELUDE,"Dream,” Aiken can divert the stream of the subconscious, whose vague"
12946,PRELUDE,"outlines he reproduces so well, to show the dream in its vivid"
12947,PRELUDE,strength.
12948,PRELUDE,
12949,PRELUDE,"Besides his varied poetry, Aiken has written a quantity of criticism"
12950,PRELUDE,"of contemporary poets, the best of his reviews having been published"
12951,PRELUDE,"in _Scepticisms_ (1919), a provocative and valuable series of"
12952,PRELUDE,studies.

12974,THE FULFILLED DREAM,
12975,THE FULFILLED DREAM,More towers must yet be built—more towers destroyed—
12976,THE FULFILLED DREAM,Great rocks hoisted in air;
12977,THE FULFILLED DREAM,And he must seek his bread in high pale sunlight
12978,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"With gulls about him, and clouds just over his eyes...."
12979,THE FULFILLED DREAM,And so he did not mention his dream of falling
12980,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"But drank his coffee in silence, and heard in his ears"
12981,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"That horrible whistle of wind, and felt his breath"
12982,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Sucked out of him, and saw the tower flash by"
12983,THE FULFILLED DREAM,And the small tree swell beneath him....
12984,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He patted his boy on the head, and kissed his wife,"
12985,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Looked quickly around the room, to remember it,—"
12986,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And so went out.... For once, he forgot his pail."
12987,THE FULFILLED DREAM,
12988,THE FULFILLED DREAM,Something had changed—but it was not the street—
12989,THE FULFILLED DREAM,The street was just the same—it was himself.
12990,THE FULFILLED DREAM,Puddles flashed in the sun. In the pawn-shop door
12991,THE FULFILLED DREAM,The same old black cat winked green amber eyes;
12992,THE FULFILLED DREAM,The butcher stood by his window tying his apron;
12993,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"The same men walked beside him, smoking pipes,"
12994,THE FULFILLED DREAM,Reading the morning paper....
12995,THE FULFILLED DREAM,
12996,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He would not yield, he thought, and walk more slowly,"
12997,THE FULFILLED DREAM,As if he knew for certain he walked to death:
12998,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"But with his usual pace,—deliberate, firm,"
12999,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Looking about him calmly, watching the world,"
13000,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Taking his ease.... Yet, when he thought again"
13001,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Of the same dream, now dreamed three separate times,"
13002,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Always the same, and heard that whistling wind,"
13003,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And saw the windows flashing upward past him,—"
13004,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He slowed his pace a little, and thought with horror"
13005,THE FULFILLED DREAM,How monstrously that small tree thrust to meet him!...
13006,THE FULFILLED DREAM,He slowed his pace a little and remembered his wife.
13007,THE FULFILLED DREAM,
13008,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Was forty, then, too old for work like this?"
13009,THE FULFILLED DREAM,Why should it be? He’d never been afraid—
13010,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"His eye was sure, his hand was steady...."
13011,THE FULFILLED DREAM,But dreams had meanings.
13012,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He walked more slowly, and looked along the roofs,"
13013,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"All built by men, and saw the pale blue sky;"
13014,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And suddenly he was dizzy with looking at it,"
13015,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"It seemed to whirl and swim,"
13016,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"It seemed the color of terror, of speed, of death...."
13017,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He lowered his eyes to the stones, he walked more slowly;"
13018,THE FULFILLED DREAM,His thoughts were blown and scattered like leaves;
13019,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He thought of the pail.... Why, then, was it forgotten?"
13020,THE FULFILLED DREAM,Because he would not need it?
13021,THE FULFILLED DREAM,
13022,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Then, just as he was grouping his thoughts again"
13023,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"About that drug-store corner, under an arc-lamp,"
13024,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Where first he met the girl whom he would marry,—"
13025,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"That blue-eyed innocent girl, in a soft blouse,—"
13026,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He waved his hand for signal, and up he went"
13027,THE FULFILLED DREAM,In the dusty chute that hugged the wall;
13028,THE FULFILLED DREAM,Above the tree; from girdered floor to floor;
13029,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Above the flattening roofs, until the sea"
13030,THE FULFILLED DREAM,Lay wide and waved before him.... And then he stepped
13031,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Giddily out, from that security,"
13032,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"To the red rib of iron against the sky,"
13033,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And walked along it, feeling it sing and tremble;"
13034,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And looking down one instant, saw the tree"
13035,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Just as he dreamed it was; and looked away,"
13036,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And up again, feeling his blood go wild."
13037,THE FULFILLED DREAM,
13038,THE FULFILLED DREAM,—He gave the signal; the long girder swung
13039,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Closer upon him, dropped clanging into place,"
13040,THE FULFILLED DREAM,Almost pushing him off. Pneumatic hammers
13041,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Began their madhouse clatter, the white-hot rivets"
13042,THE FULFILLED DREAM,Were tossed from below and deftly caught in pails;
13043,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He signalled again, and wiped his mouth, and thought"
13044,THE FULFILLED DREAM,A place so high in the air should be more quiet.
13045,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"The tree, far down below, teased at his eyes,"
13046,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Teased at the corners of them, until he looked,"
13047,THE FULFILLED DREAM,And felt his body go suddenly small and light;
13048,THE FULFILLED DREAM,Felt his brain float off like a dwindling vapor;
13049,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And heard a whistle of wind, and saw a tree"
13050,THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Come plunging up to him, and thought to himself,"
13051,THE FULFILLED DREAM,‘By God—I’m done for now; the dream was right....’

13246,FRUSTRATE[61],
13247,FRUSTRATE[61],
13248,FRUSTRATE[61],"Maxwell Bodenheim was born at Natchez, Mississippi, May 26, 1892."
13249,FRUSTRATE[61],"His education, with the exception of grammar school training, was"
13250,FRUSTRATE[61],"achieved under the guidance of the U. S. Army, in which Bodenheim"
13251,FRUSTRATE[61],"served a full enlistment of three years, beginning in 1910. For a"
13252,FRUSTRATE[61],"while he studied law and art in Chicago, but his mind, fascinated by"
13253,FRUSTRATE[61],"the new poetry, turned to literature. He wrote steadily for five"
13254,FRUSTRATE[61],"years without having a single poem accepted. In 1918, his first"
13255,FRUSTRATE[61],volume appeared and even those who were puzzled or repelled by
13256,FRUSTRATE[61],Bodenheim’s complex idiom were forced to recognize its intense
13257,FRUSTRATE[61],individuality.
13258,FRUSTRATE[61],
13259,FRUSTRATE[61],"_Minna and Myself_ (1918) reveals, first of all, this poet’s extreme"
13260,FRUSTRATE[61],"sensitivity to words. Words, under his hands, have unexpected"
13261,FRUSTRATE[61],growths; placid nouns and sober adjectives bear fantastic fruit.
13262,FRUSTRATE[61],Sometimes he packs his metaphors so close that they become
13263,FRUSTRATE[61],inextricably mixed. Sometimes he spins his fantasies so thin that
13264,FRUSTRATE[61],the cord of coherence snaps and the poem frays into ragged and
13265,FRUSTRATE[61],"unpatterned ravellings. But, at his best, Bodenheim is as"
13266,FRUSTRATE[61],clear-headed as he is colorful.
13267,FRUSTRATE[61],
13268,FRUSTRATE[61],"In _Advice_ (1920), Bodenheim’s manner—and his mannerisms—are"
13269,FRUSTRATE[61],intensified. There is scarcely a phrase that is not tricked out with
13270,FRUSTRATE[61],more ornaments and associations than it can bear; whole poems sink
13271,FRUSTRATE[61],"beneath the weight of their profuse decorations. Yet, in spite of"
13272,FRUSTRATE[61],"his verbal exaggerations, this poetry achieves a keen if too ornate"
13273,FRUSTRATE[61],"delicacy. In the realm of the whimsical-grotesque, Bodenheim walks"
13274,FRUSTRATE[61],with a light and nimble footstep.

13328,DEATH,
13329,DEATH,"Edwin Curran was born at Zanesville, Ohio, May 10, 1892, and was"
13330,DEATH,educated at St. Thomas’ School in the city of his birth. After
13331,DEATH,"working as an unskilled laborer in various trades, he learned"
13332,DEATH,telegraphy in 1914 and has been employed ever since as an operator
13333,DEATH,for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.
13334,DEATH,
13335,DEATH,In 1917 he printed a little paper-bound pamphlet of thirty pages
13336,DEATH,(_First Poems_) with this naïve note: “Price of this book is 35
13337,DEATH,"cents postpaid. Author is 25, unmarried, a beginner and needs"
13338,DEATH,"publisher. If this volume meets expenses, another, possibly better,"
13339,DEATH,"will be issued.” Expecting to find poetry of an absurd simplicity,"
13340,DEATH,"one is startled to find striking images, strange pictures and (in"
13341,DEATH,such poems as “Soldier’s Epitaph” and “Sailing of Columbus”) lines
13342,DEATH,like:
13343,DEATH,
13344,DEATH,We climbed the slippery alleys of the sea

13350,DEATH,Along the marble ground.

13352,DEATH,_Second Poems_ (1920) has a similar beauty mixed with banality. Both
13353,DEATH,"booklets are a jumble of passion, platitude, bad grammar and"
13354,DEATH,exaltation. Curran has absolutely no critical perceptions; he has
13355,DEATH,"little control over his music. For better or for worse, his mood"

13399,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"Edna St. Vincent Millay, possibly the most gifted of the younger"
13400,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"lyricists, was born February 22, 1892, at Rockland, Maine. After a"
13401,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"childhood spent almost entirely in New England, she attended Vassar"
13402,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"College, from which she was graduated in 1917. Since that time she"
13403,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"has lived in New York City. Besides her keenly individual lyrics,"
13404,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,Miss Millay has written a quantity of short stories under various
13405,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"pseudonyms, has translated several songs, and has been connected"
13406,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,with the Provincetown Players both as playwright and performer.
13407,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,
13408,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"Although the bulk of her poetry is not large, the quality of it"
13409,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"approaches and sometimes attains greatness. Her first long poem,"
13410,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"“Renascence,” was the outstanding feature of _The Lyric Year_"
13411,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"(1912), an anthology which revealed many new names. “Renascence” was"
13412,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,written when Miss Millay was scarcely nineteen; it remains today one
13413,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,of the most remarkable poems of this generation. Beginning like a
13414,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"child’s aimless verse it proceeds, with a calm lucidity, to an"
13415,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"amazing climax. It is as if a child had, in the midst of its"
13416,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"ingenuousness, uttered some terrific truth. The sheer cumulative"
13417,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,power of this poem is surpassed only by its beauty.
13418,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,
13419,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"_Renascence_, the name of Miss Millay’s first volume, was published"
13420,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,in 1917. It is full of the same passion as its title-poem; here is a
13421,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,hunger for beauty so intense that no delight is great enough to give
13422,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,the soul peace. Such poems as “God’s World” and the unnamed sonnets
13423,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,vibrate with this rapture. Magic burns from the simplest of her
13424,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,lines. _Figs from Thistles_ (1920) is a far more sophisticated
13425,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"booklet. Sharp and cynically brilliant, Miss Millay’s craftsmanship"
13426,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,no less than her intuition saves these poems from mere cleverness.
13427,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,
13428,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,_Second April_ (1921) is an intensification of her lyrical gift
13429,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,tinctured with an increasing sadness and disillusion. Her poignant
13430,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"poetic play, _Aria da Capo_, first performed by the Provincetown"
13431,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"Players in New York, was published in _The Monthly Chapbook_ (Harold"
13432,THE PAINTED HILLS OF ARIZONA,"Monro, England); the issue of July, 1920, being devoted to it."

13455,GOD’S WORLD,
13456,GOD’S WORLD,All I could see from where I stood
13457,GOD’S WORLD,Was three long mountains and a wood;
13458,GOD’S WORLD,"I turned and looked another way,"
13459,GOD’S WORLD,And saw three islands in a bay.
13460,GOD’S WORLD,So with my eyes I traced the line
13461,GOD’S WORLD,"Of the horizon, thin and fine,"
13462,GOD’S WORLD,Straight around till I was come
13463,GOD’S WORLD,Back to where I’d started from;
13464,GOD’S WORLD,And all I saw from where I stood
13465,GOD’S WORLD,Was three long mountains and a wood.
13466,GOD’S WORLD,Over these things I could not see;
13467,GOD’S WORLD,These were the things that bounded me;
13468,GOD’S WORLD,"And I could touch them with my hand,"
13469,GOD’S WORLD,"Almost, I thought, from where I stand."
13470,GOD’S WORLD,And all at once things seemed so small
13471,GOD’S WORLD,"My breath came short, and scarce at all."
13472,GOD’S WORLD,"But, sure, the sky is big, I said;"
13473,GOD’S WORLD,Miles and miles above my head;
13474,GOD’S WORLD,So here upon my back I’ll lie
13475,GOD’S WORLD,And look my fill into the sky.
13476,GOD’S WORLD,"And so I looked, and, after all,"
13477,GOD’S WORLD,The sky was not so very tall.
13478,GOD’S WORLD,"The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,"
13479,GOD’S WORLD,And—sure enough!—I see the top!
13480,GOD’S WORLD,"The sky, I thought, is not so grand;"
13481,GOD’S WORLD,I ’most could touch it with my hand!
13482,GOD’S WORLD,"And, reaching up my hand to try,"
13483,GOD’S WORLD,I screamed to feel it touch the sky.
13484,GOD’S WORLD,
13485,GOD’S WORLD,"I screamed, and—lo!—Infinity"
13486,GOD’S WORLD,Came down and settled over me;
13487,GOD’S WORLD,"And, pressing of the Undefined"
13488,GOD’S WORLD,"The definition on my mind,"
13489,GOD’S WORLD,Held up before my eyes a glass
13490,GOD’S WORLD,Through which my shrinking sight did pass
13491,GOD’S WORLD,Until it seemed I must behold
13492,GOD’S WORLD,Immensity made manifold;
13493,GOD’S WORLD,Whispered to me a word whose sound
13494,GOD’S WORLD,"Deafened the air for worlds around,"
13495,GOD’S WORLD,And brought unmuffled to my ears
13496,GOD’S WORLD,"The gossiping of friendly spheres,"
13497,GOD’S WORLD,"The creaking of the tented sky,"
13498,GOD’S WORLD,The ticking of Eternity.

13501,GOD’S WORLD,"The How and Why of all things, past,"
13502,GOD’S WORLD,"And present, and forevermore."
13503,GOD’S WORLD,"The universe, cleft to the core,"
13504,GOD’S WORLD,Lay open to my probing sense
13505,GOD’S WORLD,"That, sick’ning, I would fain pluck thence"
13506,GOD’S WORLD,"But could not,—nay! But needs must suck"
13507,GOD’S WORLD,"At the great wound, and could not pluck"
13508,GOD’S WORLD,My lips away till I had drawn
13509,GOD’S WORLD,"All venom out.—Ah, fearful pawn!"
13510,GOD’S WORLD,For my omniscience paid I toll
13511,GOD’S WORLD,In infinite remorse of soul.
13512,GOD’S WORLD,"All sin was of my sinning, all"
13513,GOD’S WORLD,"Atoning mine, and mine the gall"
13514,GOD’S WORLD,Of all regret. Mine was the weight
13515,GOD’S WORLD,"Of every brooded wrong, the hate"
13516,GOD’S WORLD,"That stood behind each envious thrust,"
13517,GOD’S WORLD,"Mine every greed, mine every lust."
13518,GOD’S WORLD,"And all the while for every grief,"
13519,GOD’S WORLD,"Each suffering, I craved relief"
13520,GOD’S WORLD,"With individual desire,—"
13521,GOD’S WORLD,Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire
13522,GOD’S WORLD,About a thousand people crawl;
13523,GOD’S WORLD,"Perished with each,—then mourned for all!"
13524,GOD’S WORLD,A man was starving in Capri;
13525,GOD’S WORLD,He moved his eyes and looked at me;
13526,GOD’S WORLD,"I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,"
13527,GOD’S WORLD,And knew his hunger as my own.
13528,GOD’S WORLD,I saw at sea a great fog-bank
13529,GOD’S WORLD,Between two ships that struck and sank;
13530,GOD’S WORLD,A thousand screams the heavens smote;
13531,GOD’S WORLD,And every scream tore through my throat.
13532,GOD’S WORLD,"No hurt I did not feel, no death"
13533,GOD’S WORLD,That was not mine; mine each last breath
13534,GOD’S WORLD,"That, crying, met an answering cry"
13535,GOD’S WORLD,From the compassion that was I.
13536,GOD’S WORLD,"All suffering mine, and mine its rod;"
13537,GOD’S WORLD,"Mine, pity like the pity of God."
13538,GOD’S WORLD,"Ah, awful weight! Infinity"
13539,GOD’S WORLD,Pressed down upon the finite Me!
13540,GOD’S WORLD,"My anguished spirit, like a bird,"
13541,GOD’S WORLD,Beating against my lips I heard;
13542,GOD’S WORLD,Yet lay the weight so close about
13543,GOD’S WORLD,There was no room for it without.
13544,GOD’S WORLD,And so beneath the weight lay I
13545,GOD’S WORLD,"And suffered death, but could not die."
13546,GOD’S WORLD,
13547,GOD’S WORLD,Deep in the earth I rested now;
13548,GOD’S WORLD,Cool is its hand upon the brow
13549,GOD’S WORLD,And soft its breast beneath the head
13550,GOD’S WORLD,Of one who is so gladly dead.
13551,GOD’S WORLD,"And all at once, and over all,"
13552,GOD’S WORLD,The pitying rain began to fall;
13553,GOD’S WORLD,I lay and heard each pattering hoof
13554,GOD’S WORLD,"Upon my lowly, thatchèd roof,"
13555,GOD’S WORLD,And seemed to love the sound far more
13556,GOD’S WORLD,Than ever I had done before.
13557,GOD’S WORLD,For rain it hath a friendly sound
13558,GOD’S WORLD,To one who’s six feet underground;
13559,GOD’S WORLD,And scarce the friendly voice or face;
13560,GOD’S WORLD,A grave is such a quiet place.
13561,GOD’S WORLD,
13562,GOD’S WORLD,"The rain, I said, is kind to come"
13563,GOD’S WORLD,And speak to me in my new home.
13564,GOD’S WORLD,I would I were alive again
13565,GOD’S WORLD,"To kiss the fingers of the rain,"
13566,GOD’S WORLD,To drink into my eyes the shine
13567,GOD’S WORLD,"Of every slanting silver line,"
13568,GOD’S WORLD,"To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze"
13569,GOD’S WORLD,From drenched and dripping apple-trees.
13570,GOD’S WORLD,"For soon the shower will be done,"
13571,GOD’S WORLD,And then the broad face of the sun
13572,GOD’S WORLD,Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth
13573,GOD’S WORLD,Until the world with answering mirth
13574,GOD’S WORLD,"Shakes joyously, and each round drop"
13575,GOD’S WORLD,"Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top."
13576,GOD’S WORLD,"How can I bear it; buried here,"
13577,GOD’S WORLD,While overhead the sky grows clear
13578,GOD’S WORLD,And blue again after the storm?
13579,GOD’S WORLD,"O, multi-colored, multiform,"
13580,GOD’S WORLD,"Beloved beauty over me,"
13581,GOD’S WORLD,"That I shall never, never see"
13582,GOD’S WORLD,"Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold,"
13583,GOD’S WORLD,That I shall never more behold!
13584,GOD’S WORLD,"Sleeping your myriad magics through,"
13585,GOD’S WORLD,Close-sepulchred away from you!
13586,GOD’S WORLD,"O God, I cried, give me new birth,"
13587,GOD’S WORLD,And put me back upon the earth!
13588,GOD’S WORLD,Upset each cloud’s gigantic gourd
13589,GOD’S WORLD,"And let the heavy rain, down-poured"
13590,GOD’S WORLD,"In one big torrent, set me free,"
13591,GOD’S WORLD,Washing my grave away from me!
13592,GOD’S WORLD,
13593,GOD’S WORLD,"I ceased; and, through the breathless hush"
13594,GOD’S WORLD,"That answered me, the far-off rush"
13595,GOD’S WORLD,Of herald wings came whispering
13596,GOD’S WORLD,Like music down the vibrant string
13597,GOD’S WORLD,"Of my ascending prayer, and—crash!"
13598,GOD’S WORLD,Before the wild wind’s whistling lash
13599,GOD’S WORLD,The startled storm-clouds reared on high
13600,GOD’S WORLD,"And plunged in terror down the sky,"
13601,GOD’S WORLD,And the big rain in one black wave
13602,GOD’S WORLD,Fell from the sky and struck my grave.
13603,GOD’S WORLD,
13604,GOD’S WORLD,I know not how such things can be
13605,GOD’S WORLD,I only know there came to me
13606,GOD’S WORLD,A fragrance such as never clings
13607,GOD’S WORLD,To aught save happy living things;
13608,GOD’S WORLD,A sound as of some joyous elf
13609,GOD’S WORLD,"Singing sweet songs to please himself,"
13610,GOD’S WORLD,"And, through and over everything,"
13611,GOD’S WORLD,A sense of glad awakening.
13612,GOD’S WORLD,"The grass, a tip-toe at my ear,"
13613,GOD’S WORLD,Whispering to me I could hear;
13614,GOD’S WORLD,I felt the rain’s cool finger-tips
13615,GOD’S WORLD,"Brushed tenderly across my lips,"
13616,GOD’S WORLD,"Laid gently on my sealèd sight,"
13617,GOD’S WORLD,And all at once the heavy night
13618,GOD’S WORLD,"Fell from my eyes and I could see,—"
13619,GOD’S WORLD,"A drenched and dripping apple-tree,"
13620,GOD’S WORLD,"A last long line of silver rain,"
13621,GOD’S WORLD,A sky grown clear and blue again.
13622,GOD’S WORLD,And as I looked a quickening gust
13623,GOD’S WORLD,Of wind blew up to me and thrust
13624,GOD’S WORLD,Into my face a miracle
13625,GOD’S WORLD,"Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,—"
13626,GOD’S WORLD,I know not how such things can be!—
13627,GOD’S WORLD,I breathed my soul back into me.
13628,GOD’S WORLD,Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I
13629,GOD’S WORLD,And hailed the earth with such a cry
13630,GOD’S WORLD,As is not heard save from a man
13631,GOD’S WORLD,"Who has been dead, and lives again."
13632,GOD’S WORLD,About the trees my arms I wound;
13633,GOD’S WORLD,Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;
13634,GOD’S WORLD,I raised my quivering arms on high;
13635,GOD’S WORLD,"I laughed and laughed into the sky,"
13636,GOD’S WORLD,Till at my throat a strangling sob
13637,GOD’S WORLD,"Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb"
13638,GOD’S WORLD,Sent instant tears into my eyes;
13639,GOD’S WORLD,"O God, I cried, no dark disguise"
13640,GOD’S WORLD,Can e’er hereafter hide from me
13641,GOD’S WORLD,Thy radiant identity!
13642,GOD’S WORLD,Thou canst not move across the grass
13643,GOD’S WORLD,"But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,"
13644,GOD’S WORLD,"Nor speak, however silently,"
13645,GOD’S WORLD,But my hushed voice will answer Thee.
13646,GOD’S WORLD,I know the path that tells Thy way
13647,GOD’S WORLD,Through the cool eve of every day;
13648,GOD’S WORLD,"God, I can push the grass apart"
13649,GOD’S WORLD,And lay my finger on Thy heart!
13650,GOD’S WORLD,
13651,GOD’S WORLD,The world stands out on either side
13652,GOD’S WORLD,No wider than the heart is wide;
13653,GOD’S WORLD,"Above the world is stretched the sky,—"
13654,GOD’S WORLD,No higher than the soul is high.
13655,GOD’S WORLD,The heart can push the sea and land
13656,GOD’S WORLD,Farther away on either hand;
13657,GOD’S WORLD,"The soul can split the sky in two,"
13658,GOD’S WORLD,And let the face of God shine through.
13659,GOD’S WORLD,But East and West will pinch the heart
13660,GOD’S WORLD,That cannot keep them pushed apart;
13661,GOD’S WORLD,And he whose soul is flat—the sky
13662,GOD’S WORLD,Will cave in on him by and by.

13730,WILD SWANS,_Mary Carolyn Davies_
13731,WILD SWANS,
13732,WILD SWANS,
13733,WILD SWANS,"Mary Carolyn Davies was born at Sprague, Washington, and was"
13734,WILD SWANS,"educated in the schools at and about Portland, Oregon. At college"
13735,WILD SWANS,(the University of California) she won the Emily Chamberlin Cook
13736,WILD SWANS,"prize for Poetry in 1912, being the first freshman to win it. In the"
13737,WILD SWANS,"same year, she established another precedent by being the first"
13738,WILD SWANS,"woman to win the Bohemian Club prize. With the proceeds, the young"
13739,WILD SWANS,"poet went to New York, arriving with the remnants of her"
13740,WILD SWANS,fortune—four dollars and eighty-five cents.
13741,WILD SWANS,
13742,WILD SWANS,The long struggle with the city began. Miss Davies wrote short
13743,WILD SWANS,"stories, two serials, reams of sentimental verses—anything to keep"
13744,WILD SWANS,"alive. She turned finally to verse, chiefly because “when the rent"
13745,WILD SWANS,"is due there’s no time to write a story, only verse can save one in"
13746,WILD SWANS,time.”
13747,WILD SWANS,
13748,WILD SWANS,Her work divides itself into two distinct classes: the hackwork
13749,WILD SWANS,which she does for a living and the genuine poetry which she creates
13750,WILD SWANS,for its own sake. Her first volume _The Drums in Our Street_ (1918)
13751,WILD SWANS,"was a mixture of loud bombast and quiet beauty, of blatant war-verse"
13752,WILD SWANS,"and unaffected lyrics. _Youth Riding_ (1919), although as uneven as"
13753,WILD SWANS,"its predecessor, is simpler and surer. The poems in _vers libre_ are"
13754,WILD SWANS,"clearly musical, and her eight-line lyrics are particularly wistful"
13755,WILD SWANS,and delicate.

13964,IN A MUSEUM,sight that is sharpened by insight. Many of Brody’s lines are
13965,IN A MUSEUM,"uncouth and awkward; what music he achieves is mostly fortuitous,"
13966,IN A MUSEUM,the melody accidental. And yet his pages are filled with a
13967,IN A MUSEUM,picturesque honesty and uncompromising beauty. Much of this work is
13968,IN A MUSEUM,an interpretation of the modern world against a background of old
13969,IN A MUSEUM,dreams: young America seen through the eyes of old Russia. It is a
13970,IN A MUSEUM,romantic realism that uplifts such poems as “Kartúshkiya-Beróza” (a
13971,IN A MUSEUM,record of boyhood which is one of Brody’s finest achievements
13972,IN A MUSEUM,"though, unfortunately, too long to quote), “A Row of Poplars:"
13973,IN A MUSEUM,"Central Park,” “Ghetto Twilight” and the poignant “Lamentations.” It"
13974,IN A MUSEUM,"is, to be more accurate, a romanticism that springs from reality"
13975,IN A MUSEUM,"and, after a fantastic flight, settles back with a new vision."

14036,GHETTO TWILIGHT,
14037,GHETTO TWILIGHT,
14038,GHETTO TWILIGHT,"Stephen Vincent Benét, the younger brother of William Rose Benét,"
14039,GHETTO TWILIGHT,"was born at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in July, 1898. He was educated"
14040,GHETTO TWILIGHT,"in various parts of the country, graduating from Yale in 1919."
14041,GHETTO TWILIGHT,
14042,GHETTO TWILIGHT,At seventeen he published a small book containing six dramatic
14043,GHETTO TWILIGHT,"portraits, _Five Men and Pompey_ (1915), a remarkable set of"
14044,GHETTO TWILIGHT,"monologues which, in spite of distinct traces of Browning and Alfred"
14045,GHETTO TWILIGHT,"Noyes, was little short of astounding, coming from a schoolboy. In"
14046,GHETTO TWILIGHT,"Benét’s next volume, _Young Adventure_ (1918), one hears something"
14047,GHETTO TWILIGHT,more than the speech of an infant prodigy; the precocious facility
14048,GHETTO TWILIGHT,has developed into a keen and individual vigor.
14049,GHETTO TWILIGHT,
14050,GHETTO TWILIGHT,"_Heavens and Earth_ (1920), the most representative collection, has"
14051,GHETTO TWILIGHT,"a greater imaginative sweep. Like his brother, the younger Benét is"
14052,GHETTO TWILIGHT,at his best in the decoratively grotesque; his fancy exults in
14053,GHETTO TWILIGHT,running the scales between the whimsically bizarre and the lightly
14054,GHETTO TWILIGHT,diabolic.

14059,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"After the whipping, he crawled into bed;"
14060,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,Accepting the harsh fact with no great weeping.
14061,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,How funny uncle’s hat had looked striped red!
14062,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"He chuckled silently. The moon came, sweeping"
14063,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,A black frayed rag of tattered cloud before
14064,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"In scorning; very pure and pale she seemed,"
14065,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,Flooding his bed with radiance. On the floor
14066,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,Fat motes danced. He sobbed; closed his eyes and dreamed.
14067,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,
14068,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,Warm sand flowed round him. Blurts of crimson light
14069,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,Splashed the white grains like blood. Past the cave’s mouth
14070,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Shone with a large fierce splendor, wildly bright,"
14071,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,The crooked constellations of the South;
14072,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Here the Cross swung; and there, affronting Mars,"
14073,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,The Centaur stormed aside a froth of stars.
14074,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Within, great casks like wattled aldermen"
14075,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Sighed of enormous feasts, and cloth of gold"
14076,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Glowed on the walls like hot desire. Again,"
14077,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Beside webbed purples from some galleon’s hold,"
14078,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,A black chest bore the skull and bones in white
14079,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Above a scrawled “Gunpowder!” By the flames,"
14080,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Decked out in crimson, gemmed with syenite,"
14081,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,Hailing their fellows by outrageous names
14082,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,The pirates sat and diced. Their eyes were moons.

14093,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Catskill-on-Hudson, New York, October 8, 1910. The daughter of Grace"
14094,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Hazard Conkling (see page 207), she came to Northampton,"
14095,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Massachusetts, with her mother when she was three years old and has"
14096,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"lived there since, a normal out-of-doors little girl."
14097,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,
14098,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Hilda began to write poems—or rather, to talk them—at the age of"
14099,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"four. Since that time, she has created one hundred and fifty little"
14100,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"verses, many of them astonishing in exactness of phrase and beauty"
14101,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"of vision. Hilda “tells” her poem and her mother copies it down,"
14102,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,arranges the line-divisions and reads it to the child for
14103,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,correction. Conceding a possible half-conscious shaping by Mrs.
14104,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Conkling, the quality which shines behind all of Hilda’s little"
14105,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"facets of loveliness is a straightforward ingenuousness, a childlike"
14106,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,but sweeping fantasy.
14107,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,
14108,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"_Poems by a Little Girl_ (1920), published when Hilda was a little"
14109,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"more than nine years old, is a detailed proof of this delightful"
14110,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,quality. Every poem bears its own stamp of unaffected originality;
14111,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"“Water,” “Hay-Cock,” and a dozen others are startling in their"
14112,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,precision and a power of painting the familiar in unsuspected
14113,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"colors. This child not only sees, feels and hears with the"
14114,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"concentration of a child-artist, she communicates the results of her"
14115,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,perceptions with the sensitivity of a master-craftsman. She hears a
14116,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,chickadee talking
14117,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,
14118,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,The way smooth bright pebbles
14119,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,Drop into water.
14120,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,
14121,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,Everything is extraordinarily vivid and fanciful to her keen senses.
14122,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,The rooster’s comb is “gay as a parade;” he has “pearl trinkets on
14123,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,his feet” and
14124,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,
14125,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,The short feathers smooth along his back
14126,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,"Are the dark color of wet rocks,"
14127,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,Or the rippled green of ships
14128,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,When I look at their sides through water.

14132,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,The water came in with a wavy look
14133,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,Like a spider’s web.
14134,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,
14135,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,It is too early for judgments—even for a prophecy. It is impossible
14136,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,to guess how much Hilda’s vision will be distorted by knowledge and
14137,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,the traditions that will accompany her growth. One can only hold
14138,PORTRAIT OF A BOY,one’s breath and hope for the preservation of so remarkable a

15369,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,
15370,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And so beneath the weight lay I
15371,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"And suffered death, but could not die."
15372,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,
15373,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Deep in the earth I rested now;
15374,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Cool is its hand upon the brow
15375,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And soft its breast beneath the head
15376,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Of one who is so gladly dead.
15377,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"And all at once, and over all,"
15378,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,The pitying rain began to fall;
15379,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"O God, I cried, give me new birth,"
15380,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And put me back upon the earth!
15381,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Upset each cloud’s gigantic gourd
15382,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"And let the heavy rain, down-poured"
15383,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"In one big torrent, set me free,"
15384,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Washing my grave away from me!
15385,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,
15386,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"I ceased; and, through the breathless hush"
15387,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"That answered me, the far-off rush"
15388,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Of herald wings came whispering
15389,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Like music down the vibrant string
15390,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Of my ascending prayer, and—crash!"
15391,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Before the wild wind’s whistling lash
15392,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,The startled storm-clouds reared on high
15393,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"And plunged in terror down the sky,"
15394,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And the big rain in one black wave
15395,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Fell from the sky and struck my grave.
15396,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,
15397,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,I know not how such things can be
15398,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,I only know there came to me
15399,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,A fragrance such as never clings
15400,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,To aught save happy living things;
15401,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,A sound as of some joyous elf
15402,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Singing sweet songs to please himself,"
15403,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"And, through and over everything,"
15404,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,A sense of glad awakening.
15405,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"The grass, a tip-toe at my ear,"
15406,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Whispering to me I could hear;
15407,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,I felt the rain’s cool finger-tips
15408,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Brushed tenderly across my lips,"
15409,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Laid gently on my sealèd sight,"
15410,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And all at once the heavy night
15411,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Fell from my eyes and I could see,—"
15412,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,I lay and heard each pattering hoof
15413,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Upon my lowly, thatchèd roof,"
15414,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And seemed to love the sound far more
15415,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Than ever I had done before.
15416,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,For rain it hath a friendly sound
15417,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,To one who’s six feet underground;
15418,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And scarce the friendly voice or face:
15419,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,A grave is such a quiet place.
15420,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,
15421,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"The rain, I said, is kind to come"
15422,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And speak to me in my new home.
15423,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,I would I were alive again
15424,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"To kiss the fingers of the rain,"
15425,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,To drink into my eyes the shine
15426,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Of every slanting silver line,"
15427,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze"
15428,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,From drenched and dripping apple-trees.
15429,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"For soon the shower will be done,"
15430,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And then the broad face of the sun
15431,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth
15432,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Until the world with answering mirth
15433,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Shakes joyously, and each round drop"
15434,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top."
15435,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"How can I bear it; buried here,"
15436,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,While overhead the sky grows clear
15437,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And blue again after the storm?
15438,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"O, multi-colored, multiform,"
15439,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Beloved beauty over me,"
15440,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"That I shall never, never see"
15441,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold,"
15442,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,That I shall never more behold!
15443,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Sleeping your myriad magics through,"
15444,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Close-sepulchred away from you!
15445,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"A drenched and dripping apple-tree,"
15446,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"A last long line of silver rain,"
15447,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,A sky grown clear and blue again.
15448,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And as I looked a quickening gust
15449,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Of wind blew up to me and thrust
15450,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Into my face a miracle
15451,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,—"
15452,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,I know not how such things can be!—
15453,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,I breathed my soul back into me.
15454,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I
15455,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,And hailed the earth with such a cry
15456,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,As is not heard save from a man
15457,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,"Who has been dead, and lives again."
15458,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,About the trees my arms I wound;
15459,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;
15460,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,
15461,TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES,
