182,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,
183,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"Doubtless many who take up this book, and glance carelessly at its"
184,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"pages, will exclaim, “What! more Spiritualism!” To which remark I"
185,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"answer, yes, more Spiritualism, an unequivocal, undisguised, positive"
186,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"Spiritualism--confirmed by many years of careful observation, study, and"
187,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"experience, and of which this book is the legitimate outgrowth. Eight"
188,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,years have elapsed since my first volume--“Poems from the Inner
189,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,Life”--was given to the world (to the Preface of which I now refer for
190,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"any explanation concerning my mediumship). During that interval of time,"
191,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,the ranks of the believers in Spiritualism have steadily increased in
192,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"numbers, its phenomena, presenting an array of well-established facts,"
193,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,have challenged the investigation of some of the first scientific minds
194,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"of the age, and its philosophy has done more towards liberating the"
195,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,human mind from the thraldom of old superstitions and creeds than any
196,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"other form of faith which has arisen for centuries. But as yet, it has"
197,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,not secured that prestige of popularity and respectability which the
198,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"combined influence of age, wealth, and organized action ever afforded."
199,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"Consequently, those who are “named by its name” must be prepared to meet"
200,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,the anathemas of religious bigots--the lofty scorn of those who are wise
201,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,in their own conceit--the scurrilous attacks of those who would divert
202,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,attention from their own infamy and the petty irritations of a numerous
203,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"pack who follow at the heels of every new movement, and ever distinguish"
204,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,themselves by noise rather than by knowledge. As a participant in this
205,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"great movement, I have found such attacks to be helps rather than"
206,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"hinderances to my progress, inasmuch as I have been enabled to define my"
207,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,own positive and affirmative position more clearly from the negations of
208,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,the opposers of Spiritualism.
209,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,
210,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,We are told that “it is not a Religion.” But after a long and careful
211,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"study of the past and present, I have yet to find any phase of faith,"
212,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"which, in its very inception has commenced so directly at the root of"
213,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"all necessary reform, viz., the purification and harmonious development"
214,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,of the human body. This primary and fundamental truth has been taken as
215,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,a starting-point--it has been enunciated from the spirit world--repeated
216,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,by the inspirational speakers--has been interwoven with all the
217,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"spiritualistic literature, and has found a practical application in the"
218,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"Children’s Lyceums. The religion that teaches, “Take care of the soul,"
219,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"and let the body take care of itself,” will inevitably defeat its own"
220,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"purposes, and has already been taught long enough for us to know that it"
221,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,is a failure. No other form of faith ever brought the spiritual world so
222,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"near, _as to banish its supernatural character, and place it within the"
223,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,province of natural law_. No other form of faith has _illustrated_ the
224,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"fact _so clearly_, that just as we go out of this world, so do we enter"
225,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"upon the next, thereby presenting a more rational incentive to endeavor,"
226,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,than the rewards of Heaven or the punishments of Hell; and no other from
227,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,of faith has so effectually dissipated the idea of an inane and
228,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"purposeless life in the future, and given to the angels a more exalted"
229,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,employment than “loafing around the throne.” It also teaches that
230,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"mediumship, under proper circumstances, is a _healthy, harmonious, and"
231,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"normal development of human nature_, and that communion with the"
232,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"spiritual world is not interdicted, and no more impossible than any"
233,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"other attainment that lies in the direct line of natural law, human"
234,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"progress, and scientific investigation. This to me, and to those who"
235,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"have accepted Spiritualism thoughtfully and sincerely, makes it _a"
236,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"religion indeed_, and the positive assertions of any number of"
237,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,intellectual or religious “authorities” to the contrary cannot make it
238,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,otherwise.
239,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,
240,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"We have been told again and again, that “Spiritualism is"
241,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"Supernaturalism,” that we believe in miracles, which are contrary to the"
242,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"“methods” of God’s government. We have denied this repeatedly, assuming"
243,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,that we ourselves had the best right to say what we did believe; but our
244,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"denial has not been accepted, and the reason is obvious. Any number of"
245,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"scholastic discourses, elaborately written essays, and eloquent appeals"
246,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"to popular prejudice, would lose their pith and marrow, and be found"
247,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"wanting, if this false predicate, this fabricated nucleus for their"
248,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,logic should be disallowed.
249,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,
250,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"Again, we are told that “Spiritualism is not Science;” to which we"
251,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"reply, that Spiritualism has presented facts and phenomena which the"
252,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,later discoveries in Science are tending both to explain and
253,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"substantiate. It has been demonstrated that it is not the eye that sees,"
254,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"the ear that hears, or the nerves that feel, but each of these avenues"
255,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,of sense serves to convey the vibrations of the surrounding “ether” to
256,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"the central consciousness, which alone is possessed of the power of"
257,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"perception. Since this is so, who shall dare place a limit to the"
258,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"possibilities of that consciousness, of which so little is definitely"
259,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"known? Or why should any man prescribe, as a standard for all others,"
260,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,the limitations of his own feeble consciousness. A modern reasoner tells
261,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"us that “if the bodily ear receives vibrations from one atmosphere, it"
262,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"_cannot_ receive them from another, and no fiction of an inner ear can"
263,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"give genuineness to voices and whispers of a spiritual tongue.” Since,"
264,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"however, it is not the outer ear, but the inner consciousness, that"
265,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"hears, a quickening of its perceptions will allow it to catch the"
266,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"vibrations from another atmosphere, and Spiritualism demonstrates, by"
267,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"indisputable facts, that this is so. Also, that this is not an"
268,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"_abnormal_ condition, but _perfectly legitimate_ to certain states of"
269,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,the inner consciousness.
270,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,
271,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"The revelations of the spectroscope, and the investigations of some of"
272,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"the greatest scientific minds of the present day, have determined the"
273,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,existence of a higher scale of vibrations than those which fall within
274,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,the ordinary range of human vision. All the objects and forms of life
275,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"comprehended in that scale, although so closely blended and interwoven"
276,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"with the vibrations of our own plane of existence, are lost to our dull"
277,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"perceptions, unless, through some physical or mental condition, there is"
278,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"a quickening of our inner consciousness. When this comes, as it has"
279,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"again and again to many, we have revelations from the “_spirit world_,”"
280,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"which is, after all, but a finer _material_ world, as real, as"
281,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"substantial, as objective, and as directly within the province of"
282,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"universal law, as that which we now inhabit. That we should be made"
283,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"sensibly aware of this higher life, under certain legitimate conditions,"
284,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"is perfectly _natural_. Indeed, it would be strange, with the uniformity"
285,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"of succession and development which pervades all things, if we were not."
286,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"It is not a world that is _possible_, but _actual_, not one that _might_"
287,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"be, but _is_."
288,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,
289,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"In this matter, intelligent Spiritualists range themselves side by side"
290,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"with those of whom Professor Tyndall has said, “You never hear the"
291,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,really philosophical defenders of the doctrine of uniformity speaking of
292,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,_impossibilities_ in nature. They best know that questions offer
293,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"themselves to thought, which Science, as now prosecuted, has not even"
294,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"the tendency to solve. They keep such questions open, _and will not"
295,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,tolerate any unlawful limitations of the horizon of their souls_.”
296,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"However weak and imperfect our spiritual vision may be at present, we"
297,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,shall use each and every opportunity of obtaining all the information
298,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"that is possible, either from this world or the next. The report of the"
299,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"committee chosen by the London Dialectical Society, to investigate the"
300,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"subject of Spiritualism, “bears strong testimony in favor of the reality"
301,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"of the manifestations,” and is a step in the right direction. All we ask"
302,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"of our opponents, is fair treatment and an unprejudiced consideration of"
303,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,the facts and phenomena which Spiritualism presents. We do not fear as
304,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,to the result.
305,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,
306,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,But the objection which is most frequently urged against Spiritualism
307,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"is, that “it is immoral in its tendencies.” In my anxiety to prove all"
308,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"things, I have also taken this matter into careful consideration, and"
309,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,diligently compared the annals of crime in the so-called Christian
310,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,church with those of Spiritualism. For several years I have collected
311,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"the items from the daily newspapers, that I might have them for future"
312,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"reference, and in due time come to a just and impartial conclusion. As"
313,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"I write, that record of ministerial delinquency, ecclesiastical"
314,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"abominations, and human frailty, lies before me. Where I have found one"
315,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"spiritual sheep that has gone astray, I have found ninety and nine of"
316,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,the Shepherds in Israel in great need of repentance. Let the church
317,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,cleanse her own Augean stables before she utters one word in relation to
318,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,the immoralities of Spiritualism. Casting stones and calling hard names
319,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,will not profit either party. It is neither Christianity nor
320,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"Spiritualism that is responsible for these immoralities, but _poor human"
321,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"nature_. The remedy lies not in creeds or forms of faith, but in the"
322,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"growth of Truth in the Understanding, and Love in the heart. Not as a"
323,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"Spiritualist, but as a child of humanity, do I hope that the entire"
324,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"world may yet have a moral standard, harmonious with the laws of God and"
325,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"Nature, and consistent with the highest good of the individual and"
326,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,society.
327,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,
328,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"Having, from inclination and a sense of duty to my kindred in the faith,"
329,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"pursued the subject thus far, the “Spirit moves me” to present, in"
330,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,"conclusion, a few quotations which require neither comment nor"
331,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,explanation.
332,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,
333,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,“If we are _wise_ we shall sit down upon the brink and content
334,DECLARATION OF FAITH.,ourselves with saying what the spiritual world _is not_ and _cannot

1179,ANGEL LILY.,"I asked to go with them one day,"
1180,ANGEL LILY.,But a tall angel told me nay.”
1181,ANGEL LILY.,
1182,ANGEL LILY.,"Yes--the “tall Angel” told her nay,"
1183,ANGEL LILY.,But it was only for a time;
1184,ANGEL LILY.,We knew our Lily could not stay
1185,ANGEL LILY.,Long in this uncongenial clime.
1186,ANGEL LILY.,Into their home of love and light
1187,ANGEL LILY.,The Angels led her from our sight.
1188,ANGEL LILY.,
1189,ANGEL LILY.,"They led her from the earth away,"
1190,ANGEL LILY.,"Into the blesséd “summer-land,”"
1191,ANGEL LILY.,"Leaving to us her form of clay,"
1192,ANGEL LILY.,With budding lilies in the hand;
1193,ANGEL LILY.,"An emblem of her life, to be"
1194,ANGEL LILY.,Unfolded in Eternity.
1195,ANGEL LILY.,
1196,ANGEL LILY.,"O, though there falls a gloom like night"
1197,ANGEL LILY.,"From Sorrow’s overshadowing wing,"
1198,ANGEL LILY.,How often does returning light
1199,ANGEL LILY.,"A ray of heavenly brightness bring,"
1200,ANGEL LILY.,And problems that were dark before
1201,ANGEL LILY.,Can vex the soul with doubt no more.
1202,ANGEL LILY.,
1203,ANGEL LILY.,"Beneath that heavy cloud we stood,"
1204,ANGEL LILY.,"Through which no ray of gladness stole,"
1205,ANGEL LILY.,But well we knew that Sorrow’s flood
1206,ANGEL LILY.,Would cleanse and purify the soul;
1207,ANGEL LILY.,"And when its ministry should cease,"
1208,ANGEL LILY.,Our lives would blossom fair with peace.
1209,ANGEL LILY.,
1210,ANGEL LILY.,"One evening, when the summer moon"
1211,ANGEL LILY.,"With silver radiance filled the sky,"
1212,ANGEL LILY.,And through the fragrant flowers of June
1213,ANGEL LILY.,"The balmy breeze sighed dreamily,"
1214,ANGEL LILY.,"With spirits calm and reconciled,"
1215,ANGEL LILY.,We talked of our dear Angel child.
1216,ANGEL LILY.,
1217,ANGEL LILY.,"We spoke of her we loved so well,"
1218,ANGEL LILY.,As one who only went before--
1219,ANGEL LILY.,When lo! just where the moonlight fell
1220,ANGEL LILY.,"With mellow lustre on the floor,"
1221,ANGEL LILY.,"We saw our own sweet darling stand,"
1222,ANGEL LILY.,With half-blown lilies in her hand.
1223,ANGEL LILY.,
1224,ANGEL LILY.,She seemed more beautiful and fair
1225,ANGEL LILY.,Than when a simple child of earth;
1226,ANGEL LILY.,The golden glory in her hair
1227,ANGEL LILY.,Betokened her celestial birth;
1228,ANGEL LILY.,"But as she sweetly looked and smiled,"
1229,ANGEL LILY.,We knew she was our own dear child.
1230,ANGEL LILY.,
1231,ANGEL LILY.,"O, strange to say! we did not start,"
1232,ANGEL LILY.,"We did not even wildly weep,"
1233,ANGEL LILY.,For each had schooled the wayward heart
1234,ANGEL LILY.,The law of perfect peace to keep--
1235,ANGEL LILY.,And deep as Love’s unfathomed sea
1236,ANGEL LILY.,Had been our faith that _this would be_.
1237,ANGEL LILY.,
1238,ANGEL LILY.,"O, shall we tell those moments o’er--"
1239,ANGEL LILY.,And all her words of love repeat--
1240,ANGEL LILY.,"And say how, through Time’s open door"
1241,ANGEL LILY.,She glided in with noiseless feet?
1242,ANGEL LILY.,"Nay, rather let us purely hold"
1243,ANGEL LILY.,Such things too sacred to be told.
1244,ANGEL LILY.,
1245,ANGEL LILY.,"Enough to say we wait our time,"
1246,ANGEL LILY.,"With heaven’s own sunshine in the heart,"
1247,ANGEL LILY.,"Rejoicing in the faith sublime,"
1248,ANGEL LILY.,"That those who love _can never part_,"
1249,ANGEL LILY.,"And wheresoe’er the soul may dwell,"
1250,ANGEL LILY.,That God will order all things well.

1364,“ECCE HOMO.”,"On ponderous hinges swung,"
1365,“ECCE HOMO.”,With solemn sound.
1366,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And then, straight up the foot-worn aisle,"
1367,“ECCE HOMO.”,"A strange procession made its way,"
1368,“ECCE HOMO.”,"In garments coarse, of simplest style,"

1370,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1371,“ECCE HOMO.”,"The first, most rudely clad,"
1372,“ECCE HOMO.”,A leathern girdle had
1373,“ECCE HOMO.”,About him bound.
1374,“ECCE HOMO.”,"The next, in humblest guise,"
1375,“ECCE HOMO.”,Raised not his mournful eyes
1376,“ECCE HOMO.”,From off the ground.
1377,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And next to these the dusky browed,"
1378,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And others, flushed with sin and shame,"
1379,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And women, with their faces bowed"

1381,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1382,“ECCE HOMO.”,"No voice was heard, or sound,"
1383,“ECCE HOMO.”,"From the vast concourse round,"
1384,“ECCE HOMO.”,Outspreading wide.
1385,“ECCE HOMO.”,"But onward still they passed,"
1386,“ECCE HOMO.”,Until they gained at last
1387,“ECCE HOMO.”,The altar side.
1388,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Then said the lowly one, “O ye!"
1389,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Who celebrate a Saviour’s birth,"

1403,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1404,“ECCE HOMO.”,"The lowly one replied,"
1405,“ECCE HOMO.”,"“These, standing by my side,"
1406,“ECCE HOMO.”,Came at my call;
1407,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Nor need they have one fear,"
1408,“ECCE HOMO.”,With me to enter here--
1409,“ECCE HOMO.”,God loves them all.
1410,“ECCE HOMO.”,Thou hypocrite! thou dost reject
1411,“ECCE HOMO.”,"_Me_, through thy most _unchristian creed_,"
1412,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And making truth of none effect,"
1413,“ECCE HOMO.”,Thou dost dishonor me indeed.”

1415,“ECCE HOMO.”,Around the stranger’s head
1416,“ECCE HOMO.”,A radiant halo spread
1417,“ECCE HOMO.”,Its glories bright;
1418,“ECCE HOMO.”,His meek and tender face
1419,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Beamed with transcendent grace,"
1420,“ECCE HOMO.”,And heavenly light.
1421,“ECCE HOMO.”,"There, mighty in his power for good,"
1422,“ECCE HOMO.”,"So gentle and divinely sweet,"
1423,“ECCE HOMO.”,"The “Christus Consolator” stood,"
1424,“ECCE HOMO.”,With weeping sinners at his feet.

1426,“ECCE HOMO.”,"“We must go hence,” he said,"
1427,“ECCE HOMO.”,“To find the living bread.

1436,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1437,“ECCE HOMO.”,O Christ! thou friend of men!

1453,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1454,“ECCE HOMO.”,"IT has always been thought a most critical case,"
1455,“ECCE HOMO.”,When a man was possessed of more Nature than Grace;
1456,“ECCE HOMO.”,For Theology teaches that man from the first
1457,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Was a sinner by Nature, and justly accurst;"
1458,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And “Salvation by Grace” was the wonderful plan,"
1459,“ECCE HOMO.”,Which God had invented to save erring man.
1460,“ECCE HOMO.”,"’Twas the only atonement he knew how to make,"
1461,“ECCE HOMO.”,To annul the effects of his own sad mistake.
1462,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1463,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Now this was the doctrine of good Parson Brown,"
1464,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Who preached, not long since, in a small country town."
1465,“ECCE HOMO.”,"He was zealous, and earnest, and could so excel"
1466,“ECCE HOMO.”,"In describing the tortures of sinners in Hell,"
1467,“ECCE HOMO.”,"That a famous revival commenced in the place,"
1468,“ECCE HOMO.”,And hundreds of souls found “Salvation by Grace;”
1469,“ECCE HOMO.”,"But he felt that he had not attained his desire,"
1470,“ECCE HOMO.”,Till he had converted one Peter McGuire.
1471,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1472,“ECCE HOMO.”,"This man was a blacksmith, frank, fearless and bold,"
1473,“ECCE HOMO.”,With great brawny sinews like Vulcan of old;
1474,“ECCE HOMO.”,"He had little respect for what ministers preach,"
1475,“ECCE HOMO.”,And sometimes was very profane in his speech.
1476,“ECCE HOMO.”,"His opinions were founded in clear common sense,"
1477,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And he spoke as he thought, though he oft gave offense;"
1478,“ECCE HOMO.”,"But however wanting, in whole or in part,"
1479,“ECCE HOMO.”,"He was sound, and all right, when you came to his heart."
1480,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1481,“ECCE HOMO.”,"One day the good parson, with pious intent,"
1482,“ECCE HOMO.”,To the smithy of Peter most hopefully went;
1483,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And there, while the hammer industriously swung,"
1484,“ECCE HOMO.”,"He preached, and he prayed, and exhorted, and sung,"
1485,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And warned, and entreated poor Peter to fly"
1486,“ECCE HOMO.”,From the pit of destruction before he should die;
1487,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And to wash himself clean from the world’s sinful strife,"
1488,“ECCE HOMO.”,"In the Blood of the Lamb, and the River of Life."
1489,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1490,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Well, and what would you now be inclined to expect"
1491,“ECCE HOMO.”,Was the probable issue and likely effect?
1492,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Why, he swore “like a Pirate,” and what do you think?"
1493,“ECCE HOMO.”,From a little black bottle took something to drink!
1494,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And he said, “I’ll not mention the Blood of the Lamb,"
1495,“ECCE HOMO.”,But as for that River it aren’t worth a----;”
1496,“ECCE HOMO.”,Then pausing--as if to restrain his rude force--
1497,“ECCE HOMO.”,"He quietly added, “a mill-dam, of course.”"
1498,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1499,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Quick out of the smithy the minister fled,"
1500,“ECCE HOMO.”,As if a big bomb-shell had burst near his head;
1501,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And as he continued to haste on his way,"
1502,“ECCE HOMO.”,He was too much excited to sing or to pray;
1503,“ECCE HOMO.”,"But he thought how that some were elected by Grace,"
1504,“ECCE HOMO.”,As heirs of the kingdom--made sure of their place--
1505,“ECCE HOMO.”,"While others were doomed to the pains of Hell-*fire,"
1506,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And if e’er there was _one_ such, ’twas Peter McGuire."
1507,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1508,“ECCE HOMO.”,"That night, when the Storm King was riding on high,"
1509,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And the red shafts of lightning gleamed bright through the sky,"
1510,“ECCE HOMO.”,"The church of the village, “the Temple of God,”"
1511,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Was struck, for the want of a good lightning rod,"
1512,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And swiftly descending, the element dire"
1513,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Set the minister’s house, close beside it, on fire,"
1514,“ECCE HOMO.”,"While he peacefully slumbered, with never a fear"
1515,“ECCE HOMO.”,Of the terrible work of destruction so near.
1516,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1517,“ECCE HOMO.”,"There were Mary, and Hannah, and Tommy, and Joe,"
1518,“ECCE HOMO.”,"All sweetly asleep in the bedroom below,"
1519,“ECCE HOMO.”,"While their father was near, with their mother at rest,"
1520,“ECCE HOMO.”,(Like the wife of John Rogers with “one at the breast.”)
1521,“ECCE HOMO.”,"But Alice, the eldest, a gentle young dove,"
1522,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Was asleep all alone, in the room just above;"
1523,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And when the wild cry of the rescuer came,"
1524,“ECCE HOMO.”,She only was left to the pitiless flame.
1525,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1526,“ECCE HOMO.”,"The fond mother counted her treasures of love,"
1527,“ECCE HOMO.”,When lo! one was missing--“O Father above!”
1528,“ECCE HOMO.”,How madly she shrieked in her agony wild--
1529,“ECCE HOMO.”,"“My Alice! My Alice! O, save my dear child!”"
1530,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Then down on his knees fell the Parson, and prayed"
1531,“ECCE HOMO.”,That the terrible wrath of the Lord might be stayed.
1532,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Said Peter McGuire, “Prayer is good in its place,"
1533,“ECCE HOMO.”,But then it don’t suit _this_ particular case.”
1534,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1535,“ECCE HOMO.”,"He turned down the sleeves of his red flannel shirt,"
1536,“ECCE HOMO.”,To shield his great arms all besmutted with dirt;
1537,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Then into the billows of smoke and of fire,"
1538,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Not pausing an instant, dashed Peter McGuire."
1539,“ECCE HOMO.”,"O, that terrible moment of anxious suspense!"
1540,“ECCE HOMO.”,How breathless their watching! their fear how intense!
1541,“ECCE HOMO.”,And then their great joy! which was freely expressed
1542,“ECCE HOMO.”,When Peter appeared with the child on his breast.
1543,“ECCE HOMO.”,
1544,“ECCE HOMO.”,A shout rent the air when the darling he laid
1545,“ECCE HOMO.”,"In the arms of her mother, so pale and dismayed;"
1546,“ECCE HOMO.”,"And as Alice looked up and most gratefully smiled,"
1547,“ECCE HOMO.”,He bowed down his head and he wept like a child.
1548,“ECCE HOMO.”,"O, those tears of brave manhood that rained o’er his face,"
1549,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Showed the true Grace of Nature, and the Nature of Grace;"
1550,“ECCE HOMO.”,"’Twas a manifest token, a visible sign,"
1551,“ECCE HOMO.”,Of the indwelling life of the Spirit Divine.
1552,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Consider such natures, and then, if you can,"
1553,“ECCE HOMO.”,Preach of “total depravity” innate in man.
1554,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Talk of blasphemy! why, ’tis profanity wild!"
1555,“ECCE HOMO.”,To say that the Father thus cursed his own child.
1556,“ECCE HOMO.”,"Go learn of the stars, and the dew-spangled sod,"
1557,“ECCE HOMO.”,That all things rejoice in the _goodness_ of God--
1558,“ECCE HOMO.”,"That each thing created is good _in its place_,"
1559,“ECCE HOMO.”,And Nature is but the _expression_ of Grace.

2095,HESTER VAUGHN.,"the efforts of benevolent individuals, and the pressure of public"
2096,HESTER VAUGHN.,"opinion, her sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life. Susan"
2097,HESTER VAUGHN.,"A. Smith, M. D., of Philadelphia, who visited her in prison, and"

2099,HESTER VAUGHN.,following statement in relation to the circumstances attendant upon
2100,HESTER VAUGHN.,"her alleged crime: “She was deserted by her husband, who knew she"
2101,HESTER VAUGHN.,had not a relative in America. She rented a third-story room in
2102,HESTER VAUGHN.,"this city (Philadelphia), from a German family, who understood very"
2103,HESTER VAUGHN.,"little English. She furnished this room, found herself in food and"
2104,HESTER VAUGHN.,fuel for three months on twenty dollars. She was taken sick in this
2105,HESTER VAUGHN.,"room at midnight, on the 6th of February, and lingered until"
2106,HESTER VAUGHN.,"Saturday morning, the 8th, when her child was born. She told me she"
2107,HESTER VAUGHN.,"was nearly frozen, and fainted or went to sleep for a long time."
2108,HESTER VAUGHN.,"Through all this period of _agony_ she was _alone_, without"
2109,HESTER VAUGHN.,"_nourishment_ or _fire_, with her door unfastened. It has been"
2110,HESTER VAUGHN.,asserted that she confessed her guilt. I can solemnly say in the
2111,HESTER VAUGHN.,"presence of Almighty God that she never confessed guilt to me, and"
2112,HESTER VAUGHN.,stoutly affirms that no such word ever passed her lips.”]

2348,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"For countless hearts attest the while,"
2349,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"That thus, alas! too many die."
2350,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2351,THE FAMISHED HEART.,I once was of the earth like you;
2352,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"I loved, and hoped, and feared as well,"
2353,THE FAMISHED HEART.,But on my heart the kindly dew
2354,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Of fond affection never fell.
2355,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"An orphan in my early years,"
2356,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Mine was a hard and cheerless lot,"
2357,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"For I was doomed, with prayers and tears,"
2358,THE FAMISHED HEART.,To seek for love and find it not.
2359,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2360,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"A bird upon a stormy sea,"
2361,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"A lamb without a sheltering fold,"
2362,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"A vine with no supporting tree,"
2363,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"A blossom blighted by the cold,--"
2364,THE FAMISHED HEART.,The warmth of kindly atmospheres
2365,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Gave to my life no quickened start;
2366,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Love’s sunshine melted not to tears
2367,THE FAMISHED HEART.,The drifted sorrows of my heart.
2368,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2369,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Fresh from the innocence of youth,"
2370,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"I entered on the rude world’s strife,"
2371,THE FAMISHED HEART.,But evermore this venomed tooth
2372,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Was gnawing at the root of life.
2373,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"O, I was but a thing of dust!"
2374,THE FAMISHED HEART.,And what should save me from my fall?
2375,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"The tempter whispered, “Lawless lust"
2376,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Is better than no love at all!”
2377,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2378,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Then with a flinty face I turned,"
2379,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Defiant of the social ban,"
2380,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"For my poor, famished nature yearned"
2381,THE FAMISHED HEART.,For e’en such sympathy from man.
2382,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"But no! I heard, as from above,"
2383,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"This truth that many learn too late,"
2384,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"That man’s unhallowed, selfish love,"
2385,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Is far more cruel than his hate.
2386,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2387,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"I shrank from Passion’s burning breath,"
2388,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Those sensuous lips and eyes of flame,"
2389,THE FAMISHED HEART.,And from that furnace fire of death
2390,THE FAMISHED HEART.,My outraged heart unblemished came.
2391,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"But darker, deeper grew the night"
2392,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"That closed around my suffering soul,"
2393,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"And Fate’s black billows, flecked with white,"
2394,THE FAMISHED HEART.,O’er all my being seemed to roll.
2395,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2396,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"At length, within a maniac’s cell,"
2397,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"I moaned and muttered day by day,"
2398,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Till, like a loathsome thing, I fell"
2399,THE FAMISHED HEART.,From human consciousness away.
2400,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"That nightmare dream of life was brief,"
2401,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"For horror choked my struggling breath,"
2402,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"And my poor heart, with love and grief,"
2403,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Was famished even unto death.
2404,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2405,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Unconscious of my spirit’s change,"
2406,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Long did I linger near the earth,"
2407,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Until a being, kind, though strange,"
2408,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Recalled me to my conscious worth.
2409,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"From thence I seemed to be transformed,"
2410,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Renewed as by redeeming grace,"
2411,THE FAMISHED HEART.,And then my soul the purpose formed--
2412,THE FAMISHED HEART.,To seek “the Saviour of the race.”
2413,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2414,THE FAMISHED HEART.,My aspirations served to bear
2415,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"My earnest spirit swift away,"
2416,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Until a heaven, serene and fair,"
2417,THE FAMISHED HEART.,My onward progress seemed to stay.
2418,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"I came where two immortals trod,"
2419,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"In friendly converse, side by side;"
2420,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"“O, lead me to the Son of God,"
2421,THE FAMISHED HEART.,That I may worship him!” I cried.
2422,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2423,THE FAMISHED HEART.,One turned--and from his aspect mild
2424,THE FAMISHED HEART.,A benison of love was shed--
2425,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"“O, say, whom do you seek, dear child?"
2426,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"We all are sons of God,” he said."
2427,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"“Nay, nay!” I cried, “not such I mean!"
2428,THE FAMISHED HEART.,But him who died on Calvary--
2429,THE FAMISHED HEART.,The humble-hearted Nazarene!”
2430,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"He meekly answered, “_I am he!_”"
2431,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2432,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"“O, then, as sinful Mary knelt,"
2433,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"In tearful sorrow, at thy feet,"
2434,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"So does my icy nature melt,"
2435,THE FAMISHED HEART.,And her sweet reverence I repeat.
2436,THE FAMISHED HEART.,O God! O Christ! O Living All!
2437,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"‘Thou art the Life, the Truth, the Way’;"
2438,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Lo! at thy feet I humbly fall--
2439,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Cast not my sinful soul away!”
2440,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2441,THE FAMISHED HEART.,“Poor bleeding heart! poor wounded dove!”
2442,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"In tones of gentleness, he said:"
2443,THE FAMISHED HEART.,“How hast thou famished for that love
2444,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Which is indeed ‘the living bread.’
2445,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Kneel not to me; the Power Divine,"
2446,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Than I, is greater, mightier far;"
2447,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"His glories lesser lights outshine,"
2448,THE FAMISHED HEART.,As noonday hides the brightest star.”
2449,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2450,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"“You died for all the world!” I cried,"
2451,THE FAMISHED HEART.,“And therefore do I bend the knee.”
2452,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"“My friend,”[3] he answered, “at my side,"
2453,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Long ere I suffered, died for me."
2454,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"He drained for man the poisoned cup,"
2455,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"I gave my body to the cross,"
2456,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"But when the sum is counted up,"
2457,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Great is our gain, and small our loss."
2458,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2459,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"“Not thus would I be deified,"
2460,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Or claim the homage that men pay;
2461,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"But he who takes me for his guide,"
2462,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Makes me his Life, his Truth, his Way."
2463,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"O, heaven shall not descend to man,"
2464,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Nor man ascend to heaven above,"
2465,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Till he shall see Salvation’s plan
2466,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Is written in the law of love.
2467,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2468,THE FAMISHED HEART.,“Dear sister! let your fears depart--
2469,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"I have no power to bid you live,"
2470,THE FAMISHED HEART.,But I can feed your famished heart
2471,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Upon the love I freely give.
2472,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Mine are the hearts that men condemn,"
2473,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"Or crush in their ambitious strife,"
2474,THE FAMISHED HEART.,And through my love I am to them
2475,THE FAMISHED HEART.,‘The Resurrection and the Life.’”
2476,THE FAMISHED HEART.,
2477,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"He raised me gently from his feet,"
2478,THE FAMISHED HEART.,And laid my head upon his breast.
2479,THE FAMISHED HEART.,"O God! how calm, how pure and sweet,"
2480,THE FAMISHED HEART.,How more than peaceful was that rest!
2481,THE FAMISHED HEART.,I feel that blesséd presence yet--
2482,THE FAMISHED HEART.,It fills me with a joy serene--
2483,THE FAMISHED HEART.,Nor have I hungered since I met
2484,THE FAMISHED HEART.,The gentle-hearted Nazarene.

2637,MR. DE SPLAE.,"IT may seem a strange question, good people, but say,"
2638,MR. DE SPLAE.,Did you never hear tell of one Mr. De Splae?
2639,MR. DE SPLAE.,A man who made up for the lack of good sense
2640,MR. DE SPLAE.,By a wondrous amount of mere show and pretense;
2641,MR. DE SPLAE.,"Puffed up with conceit like an airy balloon,"
2642,MR. DE SPLAE.,"He was hard to approach as the “man in the moon,”"
2643,MR. DE SPLAE.,"Save when for some _purpose_ it came in his way,"
2644,MR. DE SPLAE.,"And then, O how gracious was Mr. De Splae!"
2645,MR. DE SPLAE.,
2646,MR. DE SPLAE.,"A sly politician, a popular man,"
2647,MR. DE SPLAE.,When all things went smoothly he marshaled the van;
2648,MR. DE SPLAE.,"But when there was aught like a failure to fear,"
2649,MR. DE SPLAE.,He quickly deserted or fell to the rear.
2650,MR. DE SPLAE.,"His speech for the people went “gayly and glib,”"
2651,MR. DE SPLAE.,While he drew his support from the National crib;
2652,MR. DE SPLAE.,"But when an assessment or tax was to pay,"
2653,MR. DE SPLAE.,"O, how outraged and angry was Mr. De Splae!"
2654,MR. DE SPLAE.,
2655,MR. DE SPLAE.,"He smoked, and he chewed, and he drank, and he swore;"
2656,MR. DE SPLAE.,"But then every man whom the ladies adore,"
2657,MR. DE SPLAE.,"Is prone to these failings--some more and some less,"
2658,MR. DE SPLAE.,Which are all overlooked in a man of address.
2659,MR. DE SPLAE.,It also was whispered that he had betrayed
2660,MR. DE SPLAE.,The too trusting faith of an innocent maid;
2661,MR. DE SPLAE.,"But the ladies all blamed _her_ for going astray,"
2662,MR. DE SPLAE.,While they pardoned and petted--“dear Mr. De Splae.”
2663,MR. DE SPLAE.,
2664,MR. DE SPLAE.,"There was good Mr. Honest, who lived but next door,"
2665,MR. DE SPLAE.,"He was true, and substantial, and sound to the core;"
2666,MR. DE SPLAE.,"He had made it the rule of his life, from his youth,"
2667,MR. DE SPLAE.,To shun all evasions and speak the plain truth;
2668,MR. DE SPLAE.,"But _the ladies_--who always are judges, you know,"
2669,MR. DE SPLAE.,Declared him to be a detestable beau--
2670,MR. DE SPLAE.,"Not worthy of mention within the same day,"
2671,MR. DE SPLAE.,With that _pink of perfection_--“dear Mr. De Splae.”
2672,MR. DE SPLAE.,
2673,MR. DE SPLAE.,"Withal he was pious--perhaps you will smile,"
2674,MR. DE SPLAE.,And ask how he happened the church to beguile;
2675,MR. DE SPLAE.,"Why, the churches accept men for better or worse,"
2676,MR. DE SPLAE.,If there’s only a plenty of cash in the purse.
2677,MR. DE SPLAE.,"Gold still buys remission as freely and fast,"
2678,MR. DE SPLAE.,As it did in the Catholic Church in the past.
2679,MR. DE SPLAE.,"’Tis the same thing right over, and that was the way,"
2680,MR. DE SPLAE.,That the church swallowed smoothly “_good_ Mr. De Splae.”
2681,MR. DE SPLAE.,
2682,MR. DE SPLAE.,"O, you ought to have heard him when leading in prayer!"
2683,MR. DE SPLAE.,"How he flattered the Father of All for his care,"
2684,MR. DE SPLAE.,"And confessed he was sinful a thousand times o’er,"
2685,MR. DE SPLAE.,Which ’twas morally certain the Lord knew before.
2686,MR. DE SPLAE.,"The ladies responded in sweet little sighs,"
2687,MR. DE SPLAE.,"With their elegant handkerchiefs pressed to their eyes,"

2691,MR. DE SPLAE.,"O, short-sighted mortal! Poor Mr. De Splae!"

2694,MR. DE SPLAE.,"What he was, without seeming, was known unto all."
2695,MR. DE SPLAE.,His garment of patches--his flimsy disguise--
2696,MR. DE SPLAE.,"Which had won him distinction in other men’s eyes,"
2697,MR. DE SPLAE.,"Was “changed in a twinkling”--ay, vanished away,"
2698,MR. DE SPLAE.,Leaving nothing to boast of to Mr. De Splae.
2699,MR. DE SPLAE.,
2700,MR. DE SPLAE.,"Ah, a great reputation, a title, or name,"
2701,MR. DE SPLAE.,Oft brings its possessor to sorrow and shame;
2702,MR. DE SPLAE.,"But a _character_, founded in goodness and worth,"
2703,MR. DE SPLAE.,Outlasts all the perishing glories of earth.
2704,MR. DE SPLAE.,"O’er the frailties of nature, and changes of time,"
2705,MR. DE SPLAE.,"It rises majestic, in beauty sublime,"

4617,OWEENA.,
4618,OWEENA.,“In the hunting-grounds beyond me

4629,OWEENA.,
4630,OWEENA.,Then the soft hand of Oweena

4634,OWEENA.,And Oweena safely led her
4635,OWEENA.,"Through the tempest and the midnight,"
4636,OWEENA.,"To the lodge of Massa-wam-sett,"
4637,OWEENA.,Kissed her tenderly--and vanished.
4638,OWEENA.,
4639,OWEENA.,From that time did Nah-me-o-ka

5086,THE SACRAMENT.,THE aged pastor broke the bread--
5087,THE SACRAMENT.,With trembling hands he poured the wine--
5088,THE SACRAMENT.,“Eat--drink”--in earnest tones he said--
5089,THE SACRAMENT.,“These emblems of a life divine--
5090,THE SACRAMENT.,His body broken for your sins;
5091,THE SACRAMENT.,His blood for your salvation shed;
5092,THE SACRAMENT.,The priceless sacrifice that wins
5093,THE SACRAMENT.,Life and redemption from the dead.
5094,THE SACRAMENT.,
5095,THE SACRAMENT.,"“See how with tender love he stands,"
5096,THE SACRAMENT.,And calls you to his faithful heart;
5097,THE SACRAMENT.,Lo! from his wounded side and hands
5098,THE SACRAMENT.,Again the crimson life-drops start.
5099,THE SACRAMENT.,"O sinner! wherefore will you stay,"
5100,THE SACRAMENT.,Regardless of your lost estate?
5101,THE SACRAMENT.,"Come at your Saviour’s call to-day,"
5102,THE SACRAMENT.,"Before, alas! it is too late.”"
5103,THE SACRAMENT.,
5104,THE SACRAMENT.,"Forth from his lonely seat apart,"
5105,THE SACRAMENT.,"A dark-browed, Ethiopian came,"
5106,THE SACRAMENT.,As if new life had stirred the heart
5107,THE SACRAMENT.,That beat within his manly frame.
5108,THE SACRAMENT.,"“O, give to me,” he meekly said,"
5109,THE SACRAMENT.,“A portion of that heavenly food;
5110,THE SACRAMENT.,"I too would eat the living bread,"
5111,THE SACRAMENT.,And find salvation through his blood.”
5112,THE SACRAMENT.,
5113,THE SACRAMENT.,The Pastor turned with wondering eyes;
5114,THE SACRAMENT.,"But when he saw the dusky brow,"
5115,THE SACRAMENT.,"He answered, with a quick surprise,"
5116,THE SACRAMENT.,“Ho! bold intruder! Who art thou?
5117,THE SACRAMENT.,The master’s table is not free
5118,THE SACRAMENT.,To give the low-born servant place--
5119,THE SACRAMENT.,Such privilege can only be
5120,THE SACRAMENT.,For his accepted sons of grace.”
5121,THE SACRAMENT.,
5122,THE SACRAMENT.,Upon the dusky brow there glowed
5123,THE SACRAMENT.,"A flush that was not wrath nor pride,"
5124,THE SACRAMENT.,"As forward he majestic strode,"
5125,THE SACRAMENT.,And stood close by the altar-side.
5126,THE SACRAMENT.,The broken bread his left hand spurned
5127,THE SACRAMENT.,"With sudden movement to the floor,"
5128,THE SACRAMENT.,While with his right he quickly turned
5129,THE SACRAMENT.,The consecrated chalice o’er.
5130,THE SACRAMENT.,
5131,THE SACRAMENT.,"One instant, for the tempest-cloud"
5132,THE SACRAMENT.,To gather on each pallid face.
5133,THE SACRAMENT.,And then uprose the angry crowd
5134,THE SACRAMENT.,To thrust him from the sacred place.
5135,THE SACRAMENT.,With conscious might he raised his hand--
5136,THE SACRAMENT.,A being of resistless will--
5137,THE SACRAMENT.,And uttered the sublime command
5138,THE SACRAMENT.,"That hushed the tempest--“Peace, be still!”"
5139,THE SACRAMENT.,
5140,THE SACRAMENT.,The waves of wrath and human pride
5141,THE SACRAMENT.,"Rolled back, without the power to harm,"
5142,THE SACRAMENT.,"The angry murmurs surged and died,"
5143,THE SACRAMENT.,And lo! there was a breathless calm.
5144,THE SACRAMENT.,The dusky brow to dazzling white
5145,THE SACRAMENT.,"Had in one fleeting instant turned,"
5146,THE SACRAMENT.,And round his head a halo bright
5147,THE SACRAMENT.,Of heaven’s resplendent glory burned.
5148,THE SACRAMENT.,
5149,THE SACRAMENT.,"“I do reject,” he calmly said,"
5150,THE SACRAMENT.,"“These outward forms--this bread, this wine:"
5151,THE SACRAMENT.,"Lo! at _my_ table _all_ are fed,"
5152,THE SACRAMENT.,Made welcome by a love divine.
5153,THE SACRAMENT.,"The high, the low, the rich, the poor,"
5154,THE SACRAMENT.,"The black, the white, the bond, the free,"
5155,THE SACRAMENT.,"The sinful soul, the heart impure--"
5156,THE SACRAMENT.,Forbid them not to come to me.
5157,THE SACRAMENT.,
5158,THE SACRAMENT.,"“Too long, too long have faithless creeds"
5159,THE SACRAMENT.,"Shut out the sunshine from above,"
5160,THE SACRAMENT.,"While human hearts, with human needs,"
5161,THE SACRAMENT.,Have perished from the lack of love.
5162,THE SACRAMENT.,"O, break for them truth’s living bread;"
5163,THE SACRAMENT.,"Let love, like wine, unhindered flow;"
5164,THE SACRAMENT.,"_Thus_ would I have the hungry fed,"
5165,THE SACRAMENT.,And let these outward emblems go.”
5166,THE SACRAMENT.,
5167,THE SACRAMENT.,Then from the altar-side there rose
5168,THE SACRAMENT.,"A cloud with matchless glory bright,"
5169,THE SACRAMENT.,"As when, at evening’s calm repose,"
5170,THE SACRAMENT.,The sun withdraws his radiant light.
5171,THE SACRAMENT.,"But though so far removed from all,"
5172,THE SACRAMENT.,"He seemed in presence to depart,"
5173,THE SACRAMENT.,The seed of living truth let fall

5351,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"Jealous, and selfish, and hostile to all,"
5352,A WOODLAND IDYL.,A surly old fellow was he.
5353,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"He hated his neighbor, the sassafras-tree,"
5354,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"When her leaves grew green in the spring,"
5355,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"And he almost perished with envy and spite,"
5356,A WOODLAND IDYL.,When he heard an oriole sing.
5357,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"But one thing saved him, and only one,"
5358,A WOODLAND IDYL.,From a life of sorrow and woe;
5359,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"He longed for a change in his hermit life,"
5360,A WOODLAND IDYL.,And a power in himself to grow.
5361,A WOODLAND IDYL.,
5362,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"A fair young child to the green-wood came,"
5363,A WOODLAND IDYL.,With eyes like the gentian blue;
5364,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"Her hair was like threads of an amber flame,"
5365,A WOODLAND IDYL.,And her cheek wore the sunset hue.
5366,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"Her step was light as the bounding roe,"
5367,A WOODLAND IDYL.,And her voice like a silver bell;
5368,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"She charmed the birds from their green retreats,"
5369,A WOODLAND IDYL.,And the squirrel from his cell.
5370,A WOODLAND IDYL.,
5371,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"She sang of the love, of the free, great love,"
5372,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"Which the Father has for all,"
5373,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"From the worlds of light, in the heavens above,"
5374,A WOODLAND IDYL.,To the flowers and the insects small.
5375,A WOODLAND IDYL.,
5376,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"“Ah!” sighed the Brier, the brown old Brier,"
5377,A WOODLAND IDYL.,“What has he done for me?”
5378,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"Does he give me leaves in the early spring,"
5379,A WOODLAND IDYL.,Or flowers like the locust tree?”
5380,A WOODLAND IDYL.,
5381,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"“Our God is just, and our God is true,”"
5382,A WOODLAND IDYL.,Still warbled the happy child;
5383,A WOODLAND IDYL.,“He sendeth his sunshine and silver dew
5384,A WOODLAND IDYL.,To the desert and lonely wild;
5385,A WOODLAND IDYL.,And the secret force in the tempest cloud
5386,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"To the smallest flower is given,"
5387,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"That all, by his wisdom and strength endowed,"
5388,A WOODLAND IDYL.,May live for the Lord of Heaven.”
5389,A WOODLAND IDYL.,
5390,A WOODLAND IDYL.,She passed. The old Brier was lost in thought.
5391,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"“And is it, then, really so?"
5392,A WOODLAND IDYL.,Can this wondrous change by _myself_ be wrought?
5393,A WOODLAND IDYL.,_Have_ I power in myself to grow?”
5394,A WOODLAND IDYL.,Then up from the gray old mother Earth
5395,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"Rich juices he quickly drew,"
5396,A WOODLAND IDYL.,Till the sluices and channels small were filled
5397,A WOODLAND IDYL.,With the fresh sap trickling through.
5398,A WOODLAND IDYL.,
5399,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"He called to the winds, to the warm spring winds,"
5400,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"As they played with the flowers near by,"
5401,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"And he prayed the sunshine, with golden wings,"
5402,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"On his cold, damp roots to lie."
5403,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"The spring winds blew, and the sunshine came,"
5404,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"And the Brier grew fresh and fair,"
5405,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"Till his blossoms, like wreaths of incense cups,"
5406,A WOODLAND IDYL.,With their fragrance filled the air.
5407,A WOODLAND IDYL.,
5408,A WOODLAND IDYL.,Again the child to the green-wood came;
5409,A WOODLAND IDYL.,But her step was sad and slow;
5410,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"Her eye beamed not with its love-lit flame,"
5411,A WOODLAND IDYL.,And her voice was soft and low.
5412,A WOODLAND IDYL.,
5413,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"“I am changed,” she said; “O ye birds and flowers!"
5414,A WOODLAND IDYL.,With a yearning heart I weep
5415,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"To lay me down in these quiet bowers,"
5416,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"In a long, untroubled sleep."
5417,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"For O, my heart like a flower is crushed,"
5418,A WOODLAND IDYL.,And I cling to the world no more;
5419,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"The sacred fount from its urn hath gushed,"
5420,A WOODLAND IDYL.,And the joy of my life is o’er.”
5421,A WOODLAND IDYL.,
5422,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"The summer winds through the green-wood passed,"
5423,A WOODLAND IDYL.,And the sweet Brier bowed his head;
5424,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"A garland fair at her feet he cast,"
5425,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"And in gentle tones he said,--"
5426,A WOODLAND IDYL.,
5427,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"“Return to the world, dear child, return;"
5428,A WOODLAND IDYL.,"No longer _receive_, but _give_!"

5440,JUBILATE.,
5441,JUBILATE.,
5442,JUBILATE.,THE world hath felt a quickening breath
5443,JUBILATE.,"From Heaven’s eternal shore,"
5444,JUBILATE.,And souls triumphant over Death
5445,JUBILATE.,Return to earth once more.
5446,JUBILATE.,"For _this_ we hold our jubilee,"
5447,JUBILATE.,For this with joy we sing--
5448,JUBILATE.,"“O Grave, where is thy victory?"
5449,JUBILATE.,"O Death, where is thy sting?”"
5450,JUBILATE.,
5451,JUBILATE.,Our cypress wreaths are laid aside
5452,JUBILATE.,"For amaranthine flowers,"
5453,JUBILATE.,For Death’s cold wave does not divide
5454,JUBILATE.,The souls we love from ours.
5455,JUBILATE.,"From pain, and death, and sorrow free,"
5456,JUBILATE.,They join with us to sing--
5457,JUBILATE.,"“O Grave, where is thy victory?"
5458,JUBILATE.,"O Death, where is thy sting?”"
5459,JUBILATE.,
5460,JUBILATE.,Immortal eyes look from above
5461,JUBILATE.,"Upon our joys to-night,"
5462,JUBILATE.,And souls immortal in their love
5463,JUBILATE.,In our glad songs unite.
5464,JUBILATE.,Across the waveless crystal sea
5465,JUBILATE.,The notes triumphant ring--
5466,JUBILATE.,"“O Grave, where is thy victory?"
5467,JUBILATE.,"O Death, where is thy sting?”"
5468,JUBILATE.,
5469,JUBILATE.,"“Sweet spirits, welcome yet again!”"
5470,JUBILATE.,With loving hearts we cry;
5471,JUBILATE.,"And, “Peace on earth, good will to men,”"
5472,JUBILATE.,The angel hosts reply.
5473,JUBILATE.,"From doubt and fear, through truth made free,"
5474,JUBILATE.,With faith triumphant sing--

5482,THE DIVINE IDEA.,
5483,THE DIVINE IDEA.,
5484,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"WHEN the morning came with her eyes of flame,"
5485,THE DIVINE IDEA.,And looked on the youthful earth;
5486,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"When man, at the call of the Lord of All,"
5487,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Rose up in his glorious birth;
5488,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"When the stars rang out, with a tuneful shout"
5489,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"To the mountains and the sea,"
5490,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"And the world’s great heart, with a quickened start,"
5491,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Beat time to their melody;--
5492,THE DIVINE IDEA.,
5493,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"Ere the dawning light in the heavens grew bright,"
5494,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"Ere the march of the hours began,"
5495,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"God planted the seed of a mighty need,"
5496,THE DIVINE IDEA.,In the innermost soul of man.
5497,THE DIVINE IDEA.,’Twas the yearning wild that a little child
5498,THE DIVINE IDEA.,For the fostering parent feels--
5499,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"A holy thought with his life inwrought,"
5500,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Which his simplest act reveals.
5501,THE DIVINE IDEA.,
5502,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"The lion proud, like a servant, bowed"
5503,THE DIVINE IDEA.,At the might of his sovereign will;
5504,THE DIVINE IDEA.,But to man alone was the sense made known
5505,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Of a power that was higher still.
5506,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Yet vague and dim was that thought to him;
5507,THE DIVINE IDEA.,His simple and child-like mind
5508,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"Could not gaze aright on that matchless light,"
5509,THE DIVINE IDEA.,So boundless and unconfined.
5510,THE DIVINE IDEA.,
5511,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"Gross by birth from his mother Earth,"
5512,THE DIVINE IDEA.,He needed some outward sign;
5513,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"So the artisan planned, with a cunning hand,"
5514,THE DIVINE IDEA.,A _form_ of the Great Divine.
5515,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"And Baal, and Allah, and Juggernaut,"
5516,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"And Brahma, and Zeus, and Pan,"
5517,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"Show how deeply wrought was that one great thought,"
5518,THE DIVINE IDEA.,In the worshiping soul of man.
5519,THE DIVINE IDEA.,
5520,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"Then his Deity came in the morning’s flame,"
5521,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"In the song of the sun-lit seas,"
5522,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"In the stars at night, in the noontide light,"
5523,THE DIVINE IDEA.,In the woods and the murmuring breeze.
5524,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"To the Great Divine at the idol shrine,"
5525,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"By each and by every name,"
5526,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"Through the fiery death or the prayerful breath,"
5527,THE DIVINE IDEA.,The worship was still the same.
5528,THE DIVINE IDEA.,
5529,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"Like a grain in the sod grew the thought of God,"
5530,THE DIVINE IDEA.,As Nature’s slow work appears;
5531,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"From the zoöphyte small, to the “Lord of all,”"
5532,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Through cycles and sums of years.
5533,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"But the dark grew bright, and the night grew light,"
5534,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"When the era of Truth began,"
5535,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"And the soul was taught, through its primal thought,"
5536,THE DIVINE IDEA.,_Of the life of God in man_.
5537,THE DIVINE IDEA.,
5538,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"Then the soul arose from her long repose,"
5539,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"At the Truth’s awakening breath,"
5540,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"And fearlessly trod as a child of God,"
5541,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Triumphant o’er Time and Death.
5542,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"There came a sound from the wide world round,"
5543,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"Like the surging of the sea,"
5544,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Majestic and deep in its onward sweep--
5545,THE DIVINE IDEA.,’Twas the anthem of the free.
5546,THE DIVINE IDEA.,
5547,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Through the ages dim has that holy hymn
5548,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Come down to our listening ears;
5549,THE DIVINE IDEA.,And still shall it float with a sweeter note
5550,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Through the vista of coming years.
5551,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"And a voice makes known from the viewless throne,"
5552,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"“As it hath been, shall it be--"
5553,THE DIVINE IDEA.,On! on from the past! still on to the last!
5554,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Like a river that seeks the sea.”
5555,THE DIVINE IDEA.,
5556,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"“Hour by hour, like an opening flower,"
5557,THE DIVINE IDEA.,Shall truth after truth expand;
5558,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"The sun may grow pale, and the stars may fail,"
5559,THE DIVINE IDEA.,But the purpose of God shall stand.
5560,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"Dogmas and creeds without kindred deeds,"
5561,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"And altar and fane, shall fall;"
5562,THE DIVINE IDEA.,"One bond of love, and one home above,"
5563,THE DIVINE IDEA.,And one faith shall be to all.”

5572,THE PYRAMIDS.,
5573,THE PYRAMIDS.,
5574,THE PYRAMIDS.,"A WANDERER from his childhood’s home,"
5575,THE PYRAMIDS.,"An exile from his father-land,"
5576,THE PYRAMIDS.,His weary feet were doomed to roam
5577,THE PYRAMIDS.,Far o’er the desert’s scorching sand.
5578,THE PYRAMIDS.,"No mother o’er his pillow smiled,"
5579,THE PYRAMIDS.,No sister’s hand a blessing lent;
5580,THE PYRAMIDS.,"His only couch the desert wild,"
5581,THE PYRAMIDS.,His only home an Arab tent.
5582,THE PYRAMIDS.,
5583,THE PYRAMIDS.,"Upon the classic shores of Greece,"
5584,THE PYRAMIDS.,"And by the imperial towers of Rome,"
5585,THE PYRAMIDS.,He vainly sought to find that peace
5586,THE PYRAMIDS.,Denied him in his childhood’s home.
5587,THE PYRAMIDS.,"Beneath Lake Leman’s watery bed,"
5588,THE PYRAMIDS.,"In Chillon’s dungeon damp and low,"
5589,THE PYRAMIDS.,"Communing with the mighty dead,"
5590,THE PYRAMIDS.,His spirit felt a kindred glow.
5591,THE PYRAMIDS.,
5592,THE PYRAMIDS.,"He drank Circassia’s breath of bloom,"
5593,THE PYRAMIDS.,"He climbed the Alps’ eternal snows,"
5594,THE PYRAMIDS.,"He plucked the leaves by Virgil’s tomb,"
5595,THE PYRAMIDS.,And stood where ancient Jordan flows.
5596,THE PYRAMIDS.,And where Napoleon’s falchion gleamed
5597,THE PYRAMIDS.,"Along the borders of the Nile,"
5598,THE PYRAMIDS.,"The pilgrim exile slept, and dreamed"
5599,THE PYRAMIDS.,He saw his own loved mother’s smile.
5600,THE PYRAMIDS.,
5601,THE PYRAMIDS.,"With weary feet he came, at last,"
5602,THE PYRAMIDS.,"Where, all untouched by Time’s rude hands,"
5603,THE PYRAMIDS.,The Pyramids their shadows cast
5604,THE PYRAMIDS.,Upon the desert’s burning sands.
5605,THE PYRAMIDS.,Still in their works of greatness dwelt
5606,THE PYRAMIDS.,The spirits of these mighty men;
5607,THE PYRAMIDS.,Before their majesty he knelt!
5608,THE PYRAMIDS.,He rose--and he was strong again.
5609,THE PYRAMIDS.,
5610,THE PYRAMIDS.,O thou! whose life is all inwrought
5611,THE PYRAMIDS.,"With cheerful faith and strength sublime,"
5612,THE PYRAMIDS.,Leave _thou_ some monumental thought
5613,THE PYRAMIDS.,Upon the desert waste of Time.
5614,THE PYRAMIDS.,Some exile from his native heaven
5615,THE PYRAMIDS.,"May tread the path which thou hast trod,"
5616,THE PYRAMIDS.,And through _thy works_ may strength be given
5617,THE PYRAMIDS.,To lift his spirit up to God.

5624,THE INNER MYSTERY.,The following inspirational poem was delivered at a festival
5625,THE INNER MYSTERY.,commemorative of the twentieth anniversary of the advent of Modern
5626,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Spiritualism, held in Music Hall, Boston, March 31, 1868."
5627,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5628,THE INNER MYSTERY.,It is an allegorical description of the progress of a soul from
5629,THE INNER MYSTERY.,the Valley of Superstition and Traditional Theology to the highest
5630,THE INNER MYSTERY.,mountain peaks of Natural Philosophy and Spiritual Revelation. He
5631,THE INNER MYSTERY.,is strengthened and encouraged in his progress by the voices “of
5632,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"the loved ones gone before.” At length, in the higher regions of"
5633,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"metaphysical reasoning and abstract philosophy, he encounters the"
5634,THE INNER MYSTERY.,demon Doubt--a representative of popular Theology and traditional
5635,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"authority. This Doubt endeavors to make him distrust reason, and"
5636,THE INNER MYSTERY.,render a blind credence to mere authority. In the struggle with
5637,THE INNER MYSTERY.,the demon the great Truth flashes with a realizing sense upon the
5638,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"soul, that by its inherent nature _it is older than all forms"
5639,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"of Truth, and one with God himself_. In the strength of this"
5640,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"conviction he conquers, and the demon is slain."
5641,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5642,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Thus “THE INNER MYSTERY” is revealed, and the unfolding of the"
5643,THE INNER MYSTERY.,spiritual perceptions follows as a legitimate result.
5644,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5645,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5646,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"“According to Fichte, there is a Divine Idea pervading the"
5647,THE INNER MYSTERY.,visible universe; which visible universe is indeed but its symbol
5648,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"and sensible manifestation, having in itself no meaning, or"
5649,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"even true existence, independent of it. To the mass of men this"
5650,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Divine Idea lies hidden; yet to discern it, to seize it, and live"
5651,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"wholly in it, is the condition of all genuine virtue, knowledge,"
5652,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"freedom, and the end, therefore, of all spiritual effort in every"
5653,THE INNER MYSTERY.,age.”--CARLYLE.
5654,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5655,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5656,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"In the valley, where the darkness"
5657,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Dropped its poisonous vapors on my head,"
5658,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Where the night winds moaned and murmured,"
5659,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Like the voices of the troubled dead,"
5660,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Groping, stumbling, weary and alone,"
5661,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Did I make the earth my bed,"
5662,THE INNER MYSTERY.,And my pillow was a stone.
5663,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5664,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"O, that slumber!"
5665,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"It was long, and dark, and deep,"
5666,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Till a voice cried, “Come up hither!”"
5667,THE INNER MYSTERY.,And I started from my sleep.
5668,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5669,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"“Whither?” cried I; and it answered,"
5670,THE INNER MYSTERY.,“Come up hither! for the day is dawning;
5671,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Through the gates of amethyst and amber
5672,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Shines the kindling glory of the morning.”
5673,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5674,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Gazing upward,"
5675,THE INNER MYSTERY.,I beheld assurance of the day;
5676,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Hopeful-hearted,"
5677,THE INNER MYSTERY.,O’er the mountain-path I took my way.
5678,THE INNER MYSTERY.,’Mid the pine trees
5679,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Did I hear life’s drowsy pulses start,"
5680,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Swinging, singing,"
5681,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Making sweet, but mournful music,"
5682,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Thrilling, filling,"
5683,THE INNER MYSTERY.,All the lonely places of my heart.
5684,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5685,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Then the embers of the morning,"
5686,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Smouldering on night’s funeral pyre,"
5687,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Kindling into sudden brightness,"
5688,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Lit the mountain-peaks with fire;
5689,THE INNER MYSTERY.,And the quickened heart of Nature
5690,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Answered from her Memnon lyre.
5691,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Eager, earnest, still ascending,"
5692,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Toward the glories of the day,"
5693,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"I could hear that voice my steps attending,"
5694,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"With the matin-hymn of Nature blending,"
5695,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Ever crying, “Come up hither!”"
5696,THE INNER MYSTERY.,And I followed in the way.
5697,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5698,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Bright the sky glowed with celestial splendor,"
5699,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Like the light of love from God’s own eyes;
5700,THE INNER MYSTERY.,And the lofty mountains seemed to tender
5701,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Back their crowns of glory to the skies.
5702,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Far above me,"
5703,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"In the hights so terrible and grand,"
5704,THE INNER MYSTERY.,I could see the glaciers gleaming
5705,THE INNER MYSTERY.,In the hollow of the mountain’s hand.
5706,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Flashing, dashing,"
5707,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"From the steeps the foaming cataract poured,"
5708,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Over pathways
5709,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Which the mighty avalanche had scored.
5710,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Dim and ghostly
5711,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Rose the silvery clouds of wreathéd spray,"
5712,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Rainbow-mantled,"
5713,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Vanishing in upper air away.
5714,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Elfin shadows
5715,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"O’er my lonely pathway leaped and played,"
5716,THE INNER MYSTERY.,As the pine trees
5717,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Dreamily their murmuring branches swayed.
5718,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"All the air seemed filled with voices,"
5719,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Which I ne’er had thought to hear again;
5720,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"And I fled, to leave behind me,"
5721,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Sounds of pleasure close allied to pain.
5722,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Upward, onward, did I speed my way,"
5723,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Nearer to the perfect source of day.
5724,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Awed by beauty and by terror,"
5725,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Tearful, prayerful, did I sink,"
5726,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Where the tender, blue-eyed gentian"
5727,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Bloomed upon the glacier’s brink.
5728,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5729,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"“Save me! O thou loving Lord!” I cried,"
5730,THE INNER MYSTERY.,“From the unforeseen intrusion
5731,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Of this sad, but sweet delusion,"
5732,THE INNER MYSTERY.,From this strange and cruel semblance
5733,THE INNER MYSTERY.,To the cherished love that long since died.
5734,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5735,THE INNER MYSTERY.,“Come up hither!”
5736,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Cried my unknown guide who went before.
5737,THE INNER MYSTERY.,“Come up hither!”
5738,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"And I followed in the way once more,--"
5739,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Upward, where the tempests gathered,"
5740,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Where the lightnings crouched within their lair,"
5741,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Where the mighty God of thunder
5742,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"With his hammer smote the shuddering air,"
5743,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Where the tall cliffs, battle-splintered,"
5744,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Reared their lofty summits, bleak and bare;"
5745,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Higher yet, where all my life-tide,"
5746,THE INNER MYSTERY.,With the breath of Heaven grew chill;
5747,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"And I felt my pulses quickened,"
5748,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"With a strange, electric thrill."
5749,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5750,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Not one blossom brightened in my pathway,"
5751,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Not one lichen dared that wintry breath;
5752,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"But far up above, and all around me,"
5753,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Brooded awful silence, as of death."
5754,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"And I walked where ragged precipices,"
5755,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Overhanging wild and dark abysses,"
5756,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Frowned upon the dizzy depths below;
5757,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Where the yawning chasms,"
5758,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Rent by earthquake spasms,"
5759,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Strove to fill their hungry throats with snow.
5760,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Burdened with a sense of solemn grandeur,"
5761,THE INNER MYSTERY.,With a deeply reverent heart I trod
5762,THE INNER MYSTERY.,’Mid those awful and majestic altars
5763,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Of the Unknown God.
5764,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Musing deeply,"
5765,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"As I turned an angle of the rocky wall,"
5766,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Lo! before me
5767,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Stood a figure, ghostly, gaunt, and tall;"
5768,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Like the famous, fabled image,"
5769,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Falling from Dardanian skies,"
5770,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Wrapped in white, marmorial silence,"
5771,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Did he greet my wondering eyes.
5772,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5773,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Straight upon the narrow pathway,"
5774,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Fixed as fate, he seemed to stand,"
5775,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"With a widely yawning chasm,"
5776,THE INNER MYSTERY.,And a wall on either hand.
5777,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5778,THE INNER MYSTERY.,“Come up hither! come up hither!”
5779,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Cried the voice that went before;
5780,THE INNER MYSTERY.,And my spirit leaped impatient
5781,THE INNER MYSTERY.,To obey the call once more.
5782,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5783,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"“Let me pass, I pray thee,”"
5784,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Said I in a calm and courteous tone;
5785,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"But he only gazed upon me,"
5786,THE INNER MYSTERY.,With a face as passionless as stone.
5787,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5788,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"“Prithee, stand aside!” I said more firmly,"
5789,THE INNER MYSTERY.,“For I may not stay;
5790,THE INNER MYSTERY.,I must reach the mountain-hights above me
5791,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Ere the close of day.”
5792,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5793,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"But he stirred not, spake not, breathed not,"
5794,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Only turned his stony eyes
5795,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Downward--to the yawning chasm,"
5796,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Upward--to the distant skies.
5797,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5798,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"“Wherefore,” said I,"
5799,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"With a slowly kindling wrath,"
5800,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"“Do you seek to stay my progress,"
5801,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Do you stand across my path?
5802,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"What am I to thee, or thou to me?"
5803,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Stand aside, or prithee, sirrah,"
5804,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Which is stronger we shall shortly see.
5805,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5806,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Like a statue did he stand--the same.
5807,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Then my smothered wrath waxed hotter;
5808,THE INNER MYSTERY.,“Demon! speak thy name and tell thine errand!”
5809,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Cried I, with a loudly ringing shout;"
5810,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"And his cold lips parted, as he answered,"
5811,THE INNER MYSTERY.,“I am DOUBT.
5812,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5813,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"“Go no farther,"
5814,THE INNER MYSTERY.,For a phantom lures thee on thy way;
5815,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Upward striving
5816,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Will not bring thee nearer to the perfect day.
5817,THE INNER MYSTERY.,In the valley
5818,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"All is warmth, and rest, and kindly cheer;"
5819,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Go no farther;
5820,THE INNER MYSTERY.,It is _lone_ and _very cold up here_.
5821,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5822,THE INNER MYSTERY.,“Trust not to your erring Reason
5823,THE INNER MYSTERY.,All your aspirations to control;
5824,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Man grows ripe before the season
5825,THE INNER MYSTERY.,When he heeds the promptings of the soul.
5826,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5827,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"“Come up hither! come up hither,”"
5828,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Cried the tuneful voice again;
5829,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"“Doubt should never counsel duty,"
5830,THE INNER MYSTERY.,When the way of truth is plain.
5831,THE INNER MYSTERY.,
5832,THE INNER MYSTERY.,“Stay!” replied the watchful demon;
5833,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"“Thou _shalt_ lend an ear to Doubt,"
5834,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"For, by Heaven! thou shalt not pass me"
5835,THE INNER MYSTERY.,Until thou hast heard me out.
5836,THE INNER MYSTERY.,"Thou art deeply cursed from the beginning,"
