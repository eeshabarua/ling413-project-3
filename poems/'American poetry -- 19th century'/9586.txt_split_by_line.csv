167,A LAMENT,"""The parted spirit,"
168,A LAMENT,Knoweth it not our sorrow? Answereth not
169,A LAMENT,"Its blessing to our tears?"""
170,A LAMENT,
171,A LAMENT,"The circle is broken, one seat is forsaken,"
172,A LAMENT,One bud from the tree of our friendship is shaken;
173,A LAMENT,One heart from among us no longer shall thrill
174,A LAMENT,"With joy in our gladness, or grief in our ill."
175,A LAMENT,
176,A LAMENT,Weep! lonely and lowly are slumbering now
177,A LAMENT,"The light of her glances, the pride of her brow;"
178,A LAMENT,Weep! sadly and long shall we listen in vain
179,A LAMENT,To hear the soft tones of her welcome again.
180,A LAMENT,
181,A LAMENT,Give our tears to the dead! For humanity's claim
182,A LAMENT,From its silence and darkness is ever the same;
183,A LAMENT,The hope of that world whose existence is bliss
184,A LAMENT,May not stifle the tears of the mourners of this.
185,A LAMENT,
186,A LAMENT,"For, oh! if one glance the freed spirit can throw"
187,A LAMENT,"On the scene of its troubled probation below,"
188,A LAMENT,"Than the pride of the marble, the pomp of the dead,"
189,A LAMENT,To that glance will be dearer the tears which we shed.
190,A LAMENT,
191,A LAMENT,"Oh, who can forget the mild light of her smile,"
192,A LAMENT,"Over lips moved with music and feeling the while,"
193,A LAMENT,"The eye's deep enchantment, dark, dream-like, and clear,"
194,A LAMENT,"In the glow of its gladness, the shade of its tear."
195,A LAMENT,
196,A LAMENT,"And the charm of her features, while over the whole"
197,A LAMENT,Played the hues of the heart and the sunshine of soul;
198,A LAMENT,"And the tones of her voice, like the music which seems"
199,A LAMENT,Murmured low in our ears by the Angel of dreams!
200,A LAMENT,
201,A LAMENT,But holier and dearer our memories hold
202,A LAMENT,"Those treasures of feeling, more precious than gold,"
203,A LAMENT,The love and the kindness and pity which gave
204,A LAMENT,"Fresh flowers for the bridal, green wreaths for the grave!"
205,A LAMENT,
206,A LAMENT,"The heart ever open to Charity's claim,"
207,A LAMENT,"Unmoved from its purpose by censure and blame,"
208,A LAMENT,While vainly alike on her eye and her ear
209,A LAMENT,"Fell the scorn of the heartless, the jesting and jeer."
210,A LAMENT,
211,A LAMENT,How true to our hearts was that beautiful sleeper
212,A LAMENT,"With smiles for the joyful, with tears for the weeper,"
213,A LAMENT,"Yet, evermore prompt, whether mournful or gay,"
214,A LAMENT,With warnings in love to the passing astray.
215,A LAMENT,
216,A LAMENT,"For, though spotless herself, she could sorrow for them"
217,A LAMENT,Who sullied with evil the spirit's pure gem;
218,A LAMENT,"And a sigh or a tear could the erring reprove,"
219,A LAMENT,And the sting of reproof was still tempered by love.
220,A LAMENT,
221,A LAMENT,"As a cloud of the sunset, slow melting in heaven,"
222,A LAMENT,"As a star that is lost when the daylight is given,"
223,A LAMENT,"As a glad dream of slumber, which wakens in bliss,"
224,A LAMENT,She hath passed to the world of the holy from this.

754,LUCY HOOPER.,
755,LUCY HOOPER.,
756,LUCY HOOPER.,"They tell me, Lucy, thou art dead,"
757,LUCY HOOPER.,That all of thee we loved and cherished
758,LUCY HOOPER.,Has with thy summer roses perished;
759,LUCY HOOPER.,"And left, as its young beauty fled,"
760,LUCY HOOPER.,"An ashen memory in its stead,"
761,LUCY HOOPER.,The twilight of a parted day
762,LUCY HOOPER.,"Whose fading light is cold and vain,"
763,LUCY HOOPER.,The heart's faint echo of a strain
764,LUCY HOOPER.,"Of low, sweet music passed away."
765,LUCY HOOPER.,"That true and loving heart, that gift"
766,LUCY HOOPER.,"Of a mind, earnest, clear, profound,"
767,LUCY HOOPER.,"Bestowing, with a glad unthrift,"
768,LUCY HOOPER.,"Its sunny light on all around,"
769,LUCY HOOPER.,Affinities which only could
770,LUCY HOOPER.,"Cleave to the pure, the true, and good;"
771,LUCY HOOPER.,"And sympathies which found no rest,"
772,LUCY HOOPER.,Save with the loveliest and best.
773,LUCY HOOPER.,Of them--of thee--remains there naught
774,LUCY HOOPER.,But sorrow in the mourner's breast?
775,LUCY HOOPER.,A shadow in the land of thought?
776,LUCY HOOPER.,No! Even my weak and trembling faith
777,LUCY HOOPER.,Can lift for thee the veil which doubt
778,LUCY HOOPER.,And human fear have drawn about
779,LUCY HOOPER.,The all-awaiting scene of death.
780,LUCY HOOPER.,
781,LUCY HOOPER.,Even as thou wast I see thee still;
782,LUCY HOOPER.,"And, save the absence of all ill"
783,LUCY HOOPER.,"And pain and weariness, which here"
784,LUCY HOOPER.,"Summoned the sigh or wrung the tear,"
785,LUCY HOOPER.,"The same as when, two summers back,"
786,LUCY HOOPER.,"Beside our childhood's Merrimac,"
787,LUCY HOOPER.,I saw thy dark eye wander o'er
788,LUCY HOOPER.,"Stream, sunny upland, rocky shore,"
789,LUCY HOOPER.,"And heard thy low, soft voice alone"
790,LUCY HOOPER.,"Midst lapse of waters, and the tone"
791,LUCY HOOPER.,"Of pine-leaves by the west-wind blown,"
792,LUCY HOOPER.,"There's not a charm of soul or brow,"
793,LUCY HOOPER.,"Of all we knew and loved in thee,"
794,LUCY HOOPER.,"But lives in holier beauty now,"
795,LUCY HOOPER.,Baptized in immortality!
796,LUCY HOOPER.,Not mine the sad and freezing dream
797,LUCY HOOPER.,"Of souls that, with their earthly mould,"
798,LUCY HOOPER.,"Cast off the loves and joys of old,"
799,LUCY HOOPER.,"Unbodied, like a pale moonbeam,"
800,LUCY HOOPER.,"As pure, as passionless, and cold;"
801,LUCY HOOPER.,"Nor mine the hope of Indra's son,"
802,LUCY HOOPER.,"Of slumbering in oblivion's rest,"
803,LUCY HOOPER.,"Life's myriads blending into one,"
804,LUCY HOOPER.,In blank annihilation blest;
805,LUCY HOOPER.,"Dust-atoms of the infinite,"
806,LUCY HOOPER.,"Sparks scattered from the central light,"
807,LUCY HOOPER.,And winning back through mortal pain
808,LUCY HOOPER.,Their old unconsciousness again.
809,LUCY HOOPER.,"No! I have friends in Spirit Land,"
810,LUCY HOOPER.,"Not shadows in a shadowy band,"
811,LUCY HOOPER.,"Not others, but themselves are they."
812,LUCY HOOPER.,And still I think of them the same
813,LUCY HOOPER.,As when the Master's summons came;
814,LUCY HOOPER.,"Their change,--the holy morn-light breaking"
815,LUCY HOOPER.,"Upon the dream-worn sleeper, waking,--"
816,LUCY HOOPER.,A change from twilight into day.
817,LUCY HOOPER.,
818,LUCY HOOPER.,"They 've laid thee midst the household graves,"
819,LUCY HOOPER.,"Where father, brother, sister lie;"
820,LUCY HOOPER.,"Below thee sweep the dark blue waves,"
821,LUCY HOOPER.,Above thee bends the summer sky.
822,LUCY HOOPER.,Thy own loved church in sadness read
823,LUCY HOOPER.,"Her solemn ritual o'er thy head,"
824,LUCY HOOPER.,And blessed and hallowed with her prayer
825,LUCY HOOPER.,The turf laid lightly o'er thee there.
826,LUCY HOOPER.,"That church, whose rites and liturgy,"
827,LUCY HOOPER.,"Sublime and old, were truth to thee,"
828,LUCY HOOPER.,"Undoubted to thy bosom taken,"
829,LUCY HOOPER.,As symbols of a faith unshaken.
830,LUCY HOOPER.,"Even I, of simpler views, could feel"
831,LUCY HOOPER.,The beauty of thy trust and zeal;
832,LUCY HOOPER.,"And, owning not thy creed, could see"
833,LUCY HOOPER.,"How deep a truth it seemed to thee,"
834,LUCY HOOPER.,And how thy fervent heart had thrown
835,LUCY HOOPER.,"O'er all, a coloring of its own,"
836,LUCY HOOPER.,"And kindled up, intense and warm,"
837,LUCY HOOPER.,"A life in every rite and form,"
838,LUCY HOOPER.,"As. when on Chebar's banks of old,"
839,LUCY HOOPER.,"The Hebrew's gorgeous vision rolled,"
840,LUCY HOOPER.,"A spirit filled the vast machine,"
841,LUCY HOOPER.,"A life, ""within the wheels"" was seen."
842,LUCY HOOPER.,
843,LUCY HOOPER.,"Farewell! A little time, and we"
844,LUCY HOOPER.,"Who knew thee well, and loved thee here,"
845,LUCY HOOPER.,One after one shall follow thee
846,LUCY HOOPER.,"As pilgrims through the gate of fear,"
847,LUCY HOOPER.,Which opens on eternity.
848,LUCY HOOPER.,Yet shall we cherish not the less
849,LUCY HOOPER.,All that is left our hearts meanwhile;
850,LUCY HOOPER.,The memory of thy loveliness
851,LUCY HOOPER.,"Shall round our weary pathway smile,"
852,LUCY HOOPER.,"Like moonlight when the sun has set,"
853,LUCY HOOPER.,A sweet and tender radiance yet.
854,LUCY HOOPER.,"Thoughts of thy clear-eyed sense of duty,"
855,LUCY HOOPER.,"Thy generous scorn of all things wrong,"
856,LUCY HOOPER.,"The truth, the strength, the graceful beauty"
857,LUCY HOOPER.,Which blended in thy song.
858,LUCY HOOPER.,"All lovely things, by thee beloved,"
859,LUCY HOOPER.,Shall whisper to our hearts of thee;
860,LUCY HOOPER.,"These green hills, where thy childhood roved,"
861,LUCY HOOPER.,"Yon river winding to the sea,"
862,LUCY HOOPER.,The sunset light of autumn eves
863,LUCY HOOPER.,"Reflecting on the deep, still floods,"
864,LUCY HOOPER.,"Cloud, crimson sky, and trembling leaves"
865,LUCY HOOPER.,"Of rainbow-tinted woods,"
866,LUCY HOOPER.,"These, in our view, shall henceforth take"
867,LUCY HOOPER.,A tenderer meaning for thy sake;
868,LUCY HOOPER.,"And all thou lovedst of earth and sky,"
869,LUCY HOOPER.,Seem sacred to thy memory.

1070,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1071,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Chalkley Hall, near Frankford, Pa., was the residence of Thomas"
1072,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Chalkley, an eminent minister of the Friends' denomination. He was"
1073,CHALKLEY HALL.,"one of the early settlers of the Colony, and his Journal, which was"
1074,CHALKLEY HALL.,"published in 1749, presents a quaint but beautiful picture of a"
1075,CHALKLEY HALL.,life of unostentatious and simple goodness. He was the master of a
1076,CHALKLEY HALL.,"merchant vessel, and, in his visits to the west Indies and Great"
1077,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Britain, omitted no opportunity to labor for the highest interests"
1078,CHALKLEY HALL.,"of his fellow-men. During a temporary residence in Philadelphia, in"
1079,CHALKLEY HALL.,"the summer of 1838, the quiet and beautiful scenery around the"
1080,CHALKLEY HALL.,ancient village of Frankford frequently attracted me from the heat
1081,CHALKLEY HALL.,and bustle of the city. I have referred to my youthful acquaintance
1082,CHALKLEY HALL.,with his writings in Snow-Bound.
1083,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1084,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1085,CHALKLEY HALL.,How bland and sweet the greeting of this breeze
1086,CHALKLEY HALL.,To him who flies
1087,CHALKLEY HALL.,"From crowded street and red wall's weary gleam,"
1088,CHALKLEY HALL.,Till far behind him like a hideous dream
1089,CHALKLEY HALL.,The close dark city lies
1090,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Here, while the market murmurs, while men throng"
1091,CHALKLEY HALL.,The marble floor
1092,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Of Mammon's altar, from the crush and din"
1093,CHALKLEY HALL.,Of the world's madness let me gather in
1094,CHALKLEY HALL.,My better thoughts once more.
1095,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1096,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Oh, once again revive, while on my ear"
1097,CHALKLEY HALL.,The cry of Gain
1098,CHALKLEY HALL.,"And low hoarse hum of Traffic die away,"
1099,CHALKLEY HALL.,Ye blessed memories of my early day
1100,CHALKLEY HALL.,Like sere grass wet with rain!
1101,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1102,CHALKLEY HALL.,Once more let God's green earth and sunset air
1103,CHALKLEY HALL.,Old feelings waken;
1104,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Through weary years of toil and strife and ill,"
1105,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Oh, let me feel that my good angel still"
1106,CHALKLEY HALL.,Hath not his trust forsaken.
1107,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1108,CHALKLEY HALL.,And well do time and place befit my mood
1109,CHALKLEY HALL.,Beneath the arms
1110,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Of this embracing wood, a good man made"
1111,CHALKLEY HALL.,"His home, like Abraham resting in the shade"
1112,CHALKLEY HALL.,Of Mamre's lonely palms.
1113,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1114,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Here, rich with autumn gifts of countless years,"
1115,CHALKLEY HALL.,The virgin soil
1116,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Turned from the share he guided, and in rain"
1117,CHALKLEY HALL.,And summer sunshine throve the fruits and grain
1118,CHALKLEY HALL.,Which blessed his honest toil.
1119,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1120,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Here, from his voyages on the stormy seas,"
1121,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Weary and worn,"
1122,CHALKLEY HALL.,He came to meet his children and to bless
1123,CHALKLEY HALL.,The Giver of all good in thankfulness
1124,CHALKLEY HALL.,And praise for his return.
1125,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1126,CHALKLEY HALL.,And here his neighbors gathered in to greet
1127,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Their friend again,"
1128,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Safe from the wave and the destroying gales,"
1129,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Which reap untimely green Bermuda's vales,"
1130,CHALKLEY HALL.,And vex the Carib main.
1131,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1132,CHALKLEY HALL.,"To hear the good man tell of simple truth,"
1133,CHALKLEY HALL.,Sown in an hour
1134,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Of weakness in some far-off Indian isle,"
1135,CHALKLEY HALL.,"From the parched bosom of a barren soil,"
1136,CHALKLEY HALL.,Raised up in life and power.
1137,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1138,CHALKLEY HALL.,"How at those gatherings in Barbadian vales,"
1139,CHALKLEY HALL.,A tendering love
1140,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Came o'er him, like the gentle rain from heaven,"
1141,CHALKLEY HALL.,"And words of fitness to his lips were given,"
1142,CHALKLEY HALL.,And strength as from above.
1143,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1144,CHALKLEY HALL.,"How the sad captive listened to the Word,"
1145,CHALKLEY HALL.,Until his chain
1146,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Grew lighter, and his wounded spirit felt"
1147,CHALKLEY HALL.,The healing balm of consolation melt
1148,CHALKLEY HALL.,Upon its life-long pain
1149,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1150,CHALKLEY HALL.,How the armed warrior sat him down to hear
1151,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Of Peace and Truth,"
1152,CHALKLEY HALL.,"And the proud ruler and his Creole dame,"
1153,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Jewelled and gorgeous in her beauty came,"
1154,CHALKLEY HALL.,And fair and bright-eyed youth.
1155,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1156,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Oh, far away beneath New England's sky,"
1157,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Even when a boy,"
1158,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Following my plough by Merrimac's green shore,"
1159,CHALKLEY HALL.,His simple record I have pondered o'er
1160,CHALKLEY HALL.,With deep and quiet joy.
1161,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1162,CHALKLEY HALL.,"And hence this scene, in sunset glory warm,--"
1163,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Its woods around,"
1164,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Its still stream winding on in light and shade,"
1165,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Its soft, green meadows and its upland glade,--"
1166,CHALKLEY HALL.,To me is holy ground.
1167,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1168,CHALKLEY HALL.,And dearer far than haunts where Genius keeps
1169,CHALKLEY HALL.,His vigils still;
1170,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Than that where Avon's son of song is laid,"
1171,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Or Vaucluse hallowed by its Petrarch's shade,"
1172,CHALKLEY HALL.,Or Virgil's laurelled hill.
1173,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1174,CHALKLEY HALL.,"To the gray walls of fallen Paraclete,"
1175,CHALKLEY HALL.,"To Juliet's urn,"
1176,CHALKLEY HALL.,"Fair Arno and Sorrento's orange-grove,"

1178,CHALKLEY HALL.,Like brother pilgrims turn.
1179,CHALKLEY HALL.,
1180,CHALKLEY HALL.,But here a deeper and serener charm
1181,CHALKLEY HALL.,To all is given;
1182,CHALKLEY HALL.,And blessed memories of the faithful dead
1183,CHALKLEY HALL.,O'er wood and vale and meadow-stream have shed

1222,GONE,
1223,GONE,The blessing of her quiet life

1275,TO RONGE.,This was written after reading the powerful and manly protest of
1276,TO RONGE.,"Johannes Ronge against the ""pious fraud"" of the Bishop of Treves. The"
1277,TO RONGE.,bold movement of the young Catholic priest of Prussian Silesia seemed to
1278,TO RONGE.,me full of promise to the cause of political as well as religious
1279,TO RONGE.,liberty in Europe. That it failed was due partly to the faults of the
1280,TO RONGE.,"reformer, but mainly to the disagreement of the Liberals of Germany upon"
1281,TO RONGE.,"a matter of dogma, which prevented them from unity of action. Rouge was"
1282,TO RONGE.,"born in Silesia in 1813 and died in October, 1887. His autobiography was"

1324,CHANNING.,"The last time I saw Dr. Channing was in the summer of 1841, when, in"
1325,CHANNING.,"company with my English friend, Joseph Sturge, so well known for his"
1326,CHANNING.,"philanthropic labors and liberal political opinions, I visited him in"
1327,CHANNING.,his summer residence in Rhode Island. In recalling the impressions of
1328,CHANNING.,"that visit, it can scarcely be necessary to say, that I have no"
1329,CHANNING.,"reference to the peculiar religious opinions of a man whose life,"
1330,CHANNING.,"beautifully and truly manifested above the atmosphere of sect, is now"
1331,CHANNING.,the world's common legacy.
1332,CHANNING.,
1333,CHANNING.,
1334,CHANNING.,"Not vainly did old poets tell,"

1336,CHANNING.,"God's great and crowning miracle,"
1337,CHANNING.,The hero and the saint!
1338,CHANNING.,
1339,CHANNING.,For even in a faithless day
1340,CHANNING.,Can we our sainted ones discern;
1341,CHANNING.,"And feel, while with them on the way,"
1342,CHANNING.,Our hearts within us burn.
1343,CHANNING.,
1344,CHANNING.,And thus the common tongue and pen
1345,CHANNING.,"Which, world-wide, echo Channing's fame,"
1346,CHANNING.,"As one of Heaven's anointed men,"
1347,CHANNING.,Have sanctified his name.
1348,CHANNING.,

1361,CHANNING.,And glimmered down the orchard lanes
1362,CHANNING.,The white surf of the sea.
1363,CHANNING.,
1364,CHANNING.,"With us was one, who, calm and true,"
1365,CHANNING.,"Life's highest purpose understood,"
1366,CHANNING.,"And, like his blessed Master, knew"
1367,CHANNING.,The joy of doing good.
1368,CHANNING.,
1369,CHANNING.,"Unlearned, unknown to lettered fame,"
1370,CHANNING.,Yet on the lips of England's poor
1371,CHANNING.,"And toiling millions dwelt his name,"

1373,CHANNING.,
1374,CHANNING.,"Unknown to power or place, yet where"
1375,CHANNING.,"The sun looks o'er the Carib sea,"
1376,CHANNING.,It blended with the freeman's prayer
1377,CHANNING.,And song of jubilee.
1378,CHANNING.,
1379,CHANNING.,"He told of England's sin and wrong,"
1380,CHANNING.,"The ills her suffering children know,"
1381,CHANNING.,"The squalor of the city's throng,"
1382,CHANNING.,The green field's want and woe.
1383,CHANNING.,
1384,CHANNING.,O'er Channing's face the tenderness
1385,CHANNING.,"Of sympathetic sorrow stole,"
1386,CHANNING.,"Like a still shadow, passionless,"
1387,CHANNING.,The sorrow of the soul.
1388,CHANNING.,
1389,CHANNING.,But when the generous Briton told
1390,CHANNING.,"How hearts were answering to his own,"
1391,CHANNING.,And Freedom's rising murmur rolled
1392,CHANNING.,"Up to the dull-eared throne,"
1393,CHANNING.,
1394,CHANNING.,"I saw, methought, a glad surprise"
1395,CHANNING.,"Thrill through that frail and pain-worn frame,"

1398,CHANNING.,
1399,CHANNING.,"His few, brief words were such as move"

1402,CHANNING.,To high heroic deeds.
1403,CHANNING.,
1404,CHANNING.,"No bars of sect or clime were felt,"
1405,CHANNING.,"The Babel strife of tongues had ceased,"
1406,CHANNING.,And at one common altar knelt
1407,CHANNING.,The Quaker and the priest.
1408,CHANNING.,
1409,CHANNING.,"And not in vain: with strength renewed,"
1410,CHANNING.,"And zeal refreshed, and hope less dim,"
1411,CHANNING.,"For that brief meeting, each pursued"
1412,CHANNING.,The path allotted him.
1413,CHANNING.,
1414,CHANNING.,How echoes yet each Western hill
1415,CHANNING.,And vale with Channing's dying word!
1416,CHANNING.,How are the hearts of freemen still
1417,CHANNING.,By that great warning stirred.
1418,CHANNING.,
1419,CHANNING.,"The stranger treads his native soil,"
1420,CHANNING.,"And pleads, with zeal unfelt before,"
1421,CHANNING.,"The honest right of British toil,"
1422,CHANNING.,The claim of England's poor.
1423,CHANNING.,
1424,CHANNING.,"Before him time-wrought barriers fall,"
1425,CHANNING.,"Old fears subside, old hatreds melt,"
1426,CHANNING.,"And, stretching o'er the sea's blue wall,"
1427,CHANNING.,The Saxon greets the Celt.
1428,CHANNING.,
1429,CHANNING.,"The yeoman on the Scottish lines,"
1430,CHANNING.,"The Sheffield grinder, worn and grim,"
1431,CHANNING.,"The delver in the Cornwall mines,"
1432,CHANNING.,Look up with hope to him.
1433,CHANNING.,
1434,CHANNING.,"Swart smiters of the glowing steel,"
1435,CHANNING.,"Dark feeders of the forge's flame,"
1436,CHANNING.,"Pale watchers at the loom and wheel,"
1437,CHANNING.,Repeat his honored name.
1438,CHANNING.,
1439,CHANNING.,And thus the influence of that hour
1440,CHANNING.,Of converse on Rhode Island's strand
1441,CHANNING.,"Lives in the calm, resistless power"
1442,CHANNING.,Which moves our fatherland.
1443,CHANNING.,
1444,CHANNING.,"God blesses still the generous thought,"
1445,CHANNING.,And still the fitting word He speeds
1446,CHANNING.,"And Truth, at His requiring taught,"
1447,CHANNING.,He quickens into deeds.
1448,CHANNING.,
1449,CHANNING.,Where is the victory of the grave?

1645,DANIEL WHEELER,Seals of thy true apostleship.
1646,DANIEL WHEELER,"And, if the brightest diadem,"

1648,DANIEL WHEELER,"Around the ransomed ones in bliss,"

1650,DANIEL WHEELER,"Who here, through toil and sorrow, turn"

1671,DANIEL WHEELER,The Gospel of a risen Lord;

1677,DANIEL WHEELER,"Of true obedience, minister"
1678,DANIEL WHEELER,"Beauty for ashes, and the oil"
1679,DANIEL WHEELER,"Of joy for mourning, unto her!"
1680,DANIEL WHEELER,So shall her holy bounds increase
1681,DANIEL WHEELER,With walls of praise and gates of peace
1682,DANIEL WHEELER,"So shall the Vine, which martyr tears"
1683,DANIEL WHEELER,"And blood sustained in other years,"

1909,THE HILL-TOP,From lonely years and weary miles
1910,THE HILL-TOP,The shadows fell apart;

1931,ELLIOTT.,that overwhelming tide of popular opinion and feeling which resulted in
1932,ELLIOTT.,the repeal of the tax on bread. Well has the eloquent author of The

1934,ELLIOTT.,"repealers alone, but all Britons who moisten their scanty bread with the"

1951,ELLIOTT.,As from his forge the steel.

2000,ICHABOD,This poem was the outcome of the surprise and grief and forecast of evil
2001,ICHABOD,consequences which I felt on reading the seventh of March speech of
2002,ICHABOD,"Daniel Webster in support of the ""compromise,"" and the Fugitive Slave"
2003,ICHABOD,Law. No partisan or personal enmity dictated it. On the contrary my
2004,ICHABOD,admiration of the splendid personality and intellectual power of the
2005,ICHABOD,"great Senator was never stronger than when I laid down his speech, and,"
2006,ICHABOD,"in one of the saddest moments of my life, penned my protest. I saw, as I"
2007,ICHABOD,"wrote, with painful clearness its sure results,--the Slave Power"
2008,ICHABOD,"arrogant and defiant, strengthened and encouraged to carry out its"
2009,ICHABOD,"scheme for the extension of its baleful system, or the dissolution of"
2010,ICHABOD,"the Union, the guaranties of personal liberty in the free States broken"
2011,ICHABOD,"down, and the whole country made the hunting-ground of slave-catchers."
2012,ICHABOD,"In the horror of such a vision, so soon fearfully fulfilled, if one"
2013,ICHABOD,"spoke at all, he could only speak in tones of stern and sorrowful"
2014,ICHABOD,"rebuke. But death softens all resentments, and the consciousness of a"
2015,ICHABOD,common inheritance of frailty and weakness modifies the severity of
2016,ICHABOD,"judgment. Years after, in _The Lost Occasion_ I gave utterance to an"
2017,ICHABOD,almost universal regret that the great statesman did not live to see the
2018,ICHABOD,"flag which he loved trampled under the feet of Slavery, and, in view of"
2019,ICHABOD,"this desecration, make his last days glorious in defence of ""Liberty and"
2020,ICHABOD,"Union, one and inseparable."""

4103,THE SINGER.,"This poem was written on the death of Alice Cary. Her sister Phoebe,"

4105,THE SINGER.,"lovely in person and character, they left behind them only friends and"

4107,THE SINGER.,
4108,THE SINGER.,
4109,THE SINGER.,"Years since (but names to me before),"
4110,THE SINGER.,Two sisters sought at eve my door;
4111,THE SINGER.,"Two song-birds wandering from their nest,"
4112,THE SINGER.,A gray old farm-house in the West.
4113,THE SINGER.,
4114,THE SINGER.,"How fresh of life the younger one,"
4115,THE SINGER.,"Half smiles, half tears, like rain in sun!"
4116,THE SINGER.,Her gravest mood could scarce displace
4117,THE SINGER.,The dimples of her nut-brown face.
4118,THE SINGER.,
4119,THE SINGER.,Wit sparkled on her lips not less
4120,THE SINGER.,For quick and tremulous tenderness;
4121,THE SINGER.,"And, following close her merriest glance,"
4122,THE SINGER.,Dreamed through her eyes the heart's romance.
4123,THE SINGER.,
4124,THE SINGER.,"Timid and still, the elder had"
4125,THE SINGER.,Even then a smile too sweetly sad;
4126,THE SINGER.,The crown of pain that all must wear
4127,THE SINGER.,Too early pressed her midnight hair.
4128,THE SINGER.,
4129,THE SINGER.,"Yet ere the summer eve grew long,"
4130,THE SINGER.,Her modest lips were sweet with song;
4131,THE SINGER.,A memory haunted all her words
4132,THE SINGER.,Of clover-fields and singing birds.
4133,THE SINGER.,
4134,THE SINGER.,"Her dark, dilating eyes expressed"
4135,THE SINGER.,The broad horizons of the west;
4136,THE SINGER.,Her speech dropped prairie flowers; the gold
4137,THE SINGER.,Of harvest wheat about her rolled.
4138,THE SINGER.,
4139,THE SINGER.,Fore-doomed to song she seemed to me
4140,THE SINGER.,I queried not with destiny
4141,THE SINGER.,"I knew the trial and the need,"
4142,THE SINGER.,"Yet, all the more, I said, God speed?"
4143,THE SINGER.,
4144,THE SINGER.,What could I other than I did?
4145,THE SINGER.,Could I a singing-bird forbid?
4146,THE SINGER.,Deny the wind-stirred leaf? Rebuke
4147,THE SINGER.,The music of the forest brook?
4148,THE SINGER.,
4149,THE SINGER.,"She went with morning from my door,"
4150,THE SINGER.,But left me richer than before;
4151,THE SINGER.,"Thenceforth I knew her voice of cheer,"
4152,THE SINGER.,The welcome of her partial ear.
4153,THE SINGER.,
4154,THE SINGER.,Years passed: through all the land her name
4155,THE SINGER.,A pleasant household word became
4156,THE SINGER.,All felt behind the singer stood
4157,THE SINGER.,A sweet and gracious womanhood.
4158,THE SINGER.,
4159,THE SINGER.,"Her life was earnest work, not play;"
4160,THE SINGER.,Her tired feet climbed a weary way;
4161,THE SINGER.,And even through her lightest strain
4162,THE SINGER.,We heard an undertone of pain.
4163,THE SINGER.,
4164,THE SINGER.,"Unseen of her her fair fame grew,"
4165,THE SINGER.,"The good she did she rarely knew,"
4166,THE SINGER.,Unguessed of her in life the love
4167,THE SINGER.,That rained its tears her grave above.
4168,THE SINGER.,
4169,THE SINGER.,"When last I saw her, full of peace,"
4170,THE SINGER.,She waited for her great release;
4171,THE SINGER.,"And that old friend so sage and bland,"
4172,THE SINGER.,"Our later Franklin, held her hand."
4173,THE SINGER.,
4174,THE SINGER.,For all that patriot bosoms stirs
4175,THE SINGER.,"Had moved that woman's heart of hers,"
4176,THE SINGER.,And men who toiled in storm and sun
4177,THE SINGER.,Found her their meet companion.
4178,THE SINGER.,
4179,THE SINGER.,"Our converse, from her suffering bed"
4180,THE SINGER.,To healthful themes of life she led
4181,THE SINGER.,The out-door world of bud and bloom
4182,THE SINGER.,And light and sweetness filled her room.
4183,THE SINGER.,
4184,THE SINGER.,Yet evermore an underthought
4185,THE SINGER.,"Of loss to come within us wrought,"
4186,THE SINGER.,And all the while we felt the strain
4187,THE SINGER.,Of the strong will that conquered pain.
4188,THE SINGER.,
4189,THE SINGER.,God giveth quietness at last!
4190,THE SINGER.,The common way that all have passed
4191,THE SINGER.,"She went, with mortal yearnings fond,"
4192,THE SINGER.,To fuller life and love beyond.
4193,THE SINGER.,
4194,THE SINGER.,"Fold the rapt soul in your embrace,"
4195,THE SINGER.,My dear ones! Give the singer place
4196,THE SINGER.,"To you, to her,--I know not where,--"
4197,THE SINGER.,I lift the silence of a prayer.
4198,THE SINGER.,
4199,THE SINGER.,For only thus our own we find;
4200,THE SINGER.,"The gone before, the left behind,"
4201,THE SINGER.,All mortal voices die between;
4202,THE SINGER.,The unheard reaches the unseen.
4203,THE SINGER.,
4204,THE SINGER.,Again the blackbirds sing; the streams
4205,THE SINGER.,"Wake, laughing, from their winter dreams,"
4206,THE SINGER.,And tremble in the April showers
4207,THE SINGER.,The tassels of the maple flowers.
4208,THE SINGER.,
4209,THE SINGER.,But not for her has spring renewed
4210,THE SINGER.,The sweet surprises of the wood;
4211,THE SINGER.,And bird and flower are lost to her
4212,THE SINGER.,Who was their best interpreter.
4213,THE SINGER.,
4214,THE SINGER.,What to shut eyes has God revealed?
4215,THE SINGER.,What hear the ears that death has sealed?
4216,THE SINGER.,What undreamed beauty passing show
4217,THE SINGER.,Requites the loss of all we know?
4218,THE SINGER.,
4219,THE SINGER.,"O silent land, to which we move,"
4220,THE SINGER.,"Enough if there alone be love,"
4221,THE SINGER.,And mortal need can ne'er outgrow
4222,THE SINGER.,What it is waiting to bestow!
4223,THE SINGER.,
4224,THE SINGER.,O white soul! from that far-off shore
4225,THE SINGER.,Float some sweet song the waters o'er.

4408,SUMNER,"He saw a brother in the slave,--"
4409,SUMNER,With man as equal man he dealt.
4410,SUMNER,
4411,SUMNER,Proud was he? If his presence kept
4412,SUMNER,"Its grandeur wheresoe'er he trod,"
4413,SUMNER,As if from Plutarch's gallery stepped
4414,SUMNER,"The hero and the demigod,"
4415,SUMNER,
4416,SUMNER,"None failed, at least, to reach his ear,"
4417,SUMNER,Nor want nor woe appealed in vain;
4418,SUMNER,"The homesick soldier knew his cheer,"
4419,SUMNER,And blessed him from his ward of pain.
4420,SUMNER,
4421,SUMNER,Safely his dearest friends may own
4422,SUMNER,"The slight defects he never hid,"
4423,SUMNER,The surface-blemish in the stone
4424,SUMNER,"Of the tall, stately pyramid."
4425,SUMNER,
4426,SUMNER,Suffice it that he never brought
4427,SUMNER,His conscience to the public mart;
4428,SUMNER,"But lived himself the truth he taught,"
4429,SUMNER,"White-souled, clean-handed, pure of heart."
4430,SUMNER,
4431,SUMNER,What if he felt the natural pride
4432,SUMNER,"Of power in noble use, too true"
4433,SUMNER,With thin humilities to hide
4434,SUMNER,"The work he did, the lore he knew?"
4435,SUMNER,
4436,SUMNER,Was he not just? Was any wronged
4437,SUMNER,By that assured self-estimate?
4438,SUMNER,"He took but what to him belonged,"
4439,SUMNER,Unenvious of another's state.
4440,SUMNER,
4441,SUMNER,"Well might he heed the words he spake,"
4442,SUMNER,And scan with care the written page

4445,SUMNER,
4446,SUMNER,Ah! who shall blame him now because
4447,SUMNER,He solaced thus his hours of pain!
4448,SUMNER,"Should not the o'erworn thresher pause,"
4449,SUMNER,And hold to light his golden grain?
4450,SUMNER,
4451,SUMNER,No sense of humor dropped its oil
4452,SUMNER,On the hard ways his purpose went;
4453,SUMNER,Small play of fancy lightened toil;
4454,SUMNER,He spake alone the thing he meant.
4455,SUMNER,
4456,SUMNER,"He loved his books, the Art that hints"
4457,SUMNER,"A beauty veiled behind its own,"
4458,SUMNER,"The graver's line, the pencil's tints,"
4459,SUMNER,The chisel's shape evoked from stone.
4460,SUMNER,
4461,SUMNER,"He cherished, void of selfish ends,"
4462,SUMNER,The social courtesies that bless
4463,SUMNER,"And sweeten life, and loved his friends"
4464,SUMNER,With most unworldly tenderness.
4465,SUMNER,
4466,SUMNER,But still his tired eyes rarely learned
4467,SUMNER,The glad relief by Nature brought;
4468,SUMNER,Her mountain ranges never turned
4469,SUMNER,His current of persistent thought.
4470,SUMNER,
4471,SUMNER,The sea rolled chorus to his speech
4472,SUMNER,"Three-banked like Latium's' tall trireme,"
4473,SUMNER,With laboring oars; the grove and beach
4474,SUMNER,Were Forum and the Academe.
4475,SUMNER,
4476,SUMNER,The sensuous joy from all things fair
4477,SUMNER,"His strenuous bent of soul repressed,"
4478,SUMNER,And left from youth to silvered hair
4479,SUMNER,"Few hours for pleasure, none for rest."
4480,SUMNER,
4481,SUMNER,"For all his life was poor without,"
4482,SUMNER,"O Nature, make the last amends"
4483,SUMNER,"Train all thy flowers his grave about,"
4484,SUMNER,And make thy singing-birds his friends!
4485,SUMNER,
4486,SUMNER,"Revive again, thou summer rain,"
4487,SUMNER,The broken turf upon his bed
4488,SUMNER,"Breathe, summer wind, thy tenderest strain"
4489,SUMNER,"Of low, sweet music overhead!"
4490,SUMNER,
4491,SUMNER,With calm and beauty symbolize
4492,SUMNER,"The peace which follows long annoy,"
4493,SUMNER,"And lend our earth-bent, mourning eyes,"
4494,SUMNER,Some hint of his diviner joy.
4495,SUMNER,
4496,SUMNER,"For safe with right and truth he is,"
4497,SUMNER,As God lives he must live alway;
4498,SUMNER,"There is no end for souls like his,"
4499,SUMNER,No night for children of the day!
4500,SUMNER,
4501,SUMNER,Nor cant nor poor solicitudes
4502,SUMNER,Made weak his life's great argument;
4503,SUMNER,Small leisure his for frames and moods
4504,SUMNER,Who followed Duty where she went.
4505,SUMNER,
4506,SUMNER,"The broad, fair fields of God he saw"
4507,SUMNER,Beyond the bigot's narrow bound;
4508,SUMNER,The truths he moulded into law
4509,SUMNER,In Christ's beatitudes he found.
4510,SUMNER,
4511,SUMNER,"His state-craft was the Golden Rule,"
4512,SUMNER,His right of vote a sacred trust;
4513,SUMNER,"Clear, over threat and ridicule,"
4514,SUMNER,"All heard his challenge: ""Is it just?"""
4515,SUMNER,
4516,SUMNER,"And when the hour supreme had come,"
4517,SUMNER,Not for himself a thought he gave;
4518,SUMNER,"In that last pang of martyrdom,"
4519,SUMNER,His care was for the half-freed slave.
4520,SUMNER,
4521,SUMNER,"Not vainly dusky hands upbore,"
4522,SUMNER,"In prayer, the passing soul to heaven"
4523,SUMNER,Whose mercy to His suffering poor
4524,SUMNER,Was service to the Master given.
4525,SUMNER,
4526,SUMNER,"Long shall the good State's annals tell,"
4527,SUMNER,"Her children's children long be taught,"
4528,SUMNER,"How, praised or blamed, he guarded well"
4529,SUMNER,The trust he neither shunned nor sought.
4530,SUMNER,
4531,SUMNER,"If for one moment turned thy face,"
4532,SUMNER,"O Mother, from thy son, not long"
4533,SUMNER,He waited calmly in his place
4534,SUMNER,The sure remorse which follows wrong.
4535,SUMNER,
4536,SUMNER,Forgiven be the State he loved
4537,SUMNER,"The one brief lapse, the single blot;"
4538,SUMNER,"Forgotten be the stain removed,"
4539,SUMNER,Her righted record shows it not!
4540,SUMNER,
4541,SUMNER,The lifted sword above her shield
4542,SUMNER,With jealous care shall guard his fame;
4543,SUMNER,The pine-tree on her ancient field
4544,SUMNER,To all the winds shall speak his name.
4545,SUMNER,
4546,SUMNER,The marble image of her son

5645,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"How widely soe'er you have strayed from the fold,"

5654,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5655,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"In love, let us trust, they were summoned so soon"

5658,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,And they rest as we rest in God's mercy alone.
5659,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5660,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Unchanged by our changes of spirit and frame,"

5732,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Self-will is self-wounding, perversity blind"
5733,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,On himself fell the stain for the Quaker designed!
5734,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,

5739,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5740,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"There are those who take note that our numbers are small,--"
5741,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,New Gibbons who write our decline and our fall;
5742,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"But the Lord of the seed-field takes care of His own,"

5744,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5745,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"The last of the sect to his fathers may go,"

5749,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5750,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Nothing fails of its end. Out of sight sinks the stone,"
5751,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"In the deep sea of time, but the circles sweep on,"
5752,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Till the low-rippled murmurs along the shores run,"
5753,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,And the dark and dead waters leap glad in the sun.
5754,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5755,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Meanwhile shall we learn, in our ease, to forget"

5759,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5760,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Shall we fawn round the priestcraft that glutted the shears,"
5761,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,And festooned the stocks with our grandfathers' ears?
5762,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Talk of Woolman's unsoundness? count Penn heterodox?
5763,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,And take Cotton Mather in place of George Fox?
5764,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5765,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Make our preachers war-chaplains? quote Scripture to take
5766,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"The hunted slave back, for Onesimus' sake?"
5767,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Go to burning church-candles, and chanting in choir,"
5768,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,And on the old meeting-house stick up a spire?

5774,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5775,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"The good round about us we need not refuse,"
5776,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Nor talk of our Zion as if we were Jews;
5777,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"But why shirk the badge which our fathers have worn,"
5778,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Or beg the world's pardon for having been born?
5779,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5780,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"We need not pray over the Pharisee's prayer,"
5781,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Nor claim that our wisdom is Benjamin's share;
5782,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Truth to us and to others is equal and one
5783,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Shall we bottle the free air, or hoard up the sun?"
5784,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5785,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Well know we our birthright may serve but to show
5786,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,How the meanest of weeds in the richest soil grow;
5787,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,But we need not disparage the good which we hold;
5788,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Though the vessels be earthen, the treasure is gold!"
5789,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5790,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Enough and too much of the sect and the name.
5791,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"What matters our label, so truth be our aim?"
5792,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"The creed may be wrong, but the life may be true,"
5793,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,And hearts beat the same under drab coats or blue.
5794,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5795,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"So the man be a man, let him worship, at will,"
5796,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"In Jerusalem's courts, or on Gerizim's hill."
5797,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"When she makes up her jewels, what cares yon good town"
5798,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"For the Baptist of Wayland, the Quaker of Brown?"
5799,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5800,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"And this green, favored island, so fresh and seablown,"
5801,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"When she counts up the worthies her annals have known,"
5802,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Never waits for the pitiful gaugers of sect
5803,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"To measure her love, and mete out her respect."
5804,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5805,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Three shades at this moment seem walking her strand,"
5806,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Each with head halo-crowned, and with palms in his hand,--"
5807,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Wise Berkeley, grave Hopkins, and, smiling serene"
5808,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"On prelate and puritan, Channing is seen."
5809,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5810,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"One holy name bearing, no longer they need"
5811,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Credentials of party, and pass-words of creed"
5812,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"The new song they sing hath a threefold accord,"
5813,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"And they own one baptism, one faith, and one Lord!"
5814,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5815,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,But the golden sands run out: occasions like these
5816,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Glide swift into shadow, like sails on the seas"
5817,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"While we sport with the mosses and pebbles ashore,"
5818,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"They lessen and fade, and we see them no more."
5819,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5820,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Forgive me, dear friends, if my vagrant thoughts seem"
5821,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Like a school-boy's who idles and plays with his theme.
5822,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Forgive the light measure whose changes display
5823,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,The sunshine and rain of our brief April day.
5824,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5825,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,There are moments in life when the lip and the eye
5826,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Try the question of whether to smile or to cry;
5827,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,And scenes and reunions that prompt like our own
5828,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"The tender in feeling, the playful in tone."
5829,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5830,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"I, who never sat down with the boys and the girls"
5831,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"At the feet of your Slocums, and Cartlands, and Earles,--"
5832,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,By courtesy only permitted to lay
5833,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"On your festival's altar my poor gift, to-day,--"
5834,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5835,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,I would joy in your joy: let me have a friend's part
5836,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"In the warmth of your welcome of hand and of heart,--"
5837,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"On your play-ground of boyhood unbend the brow's care,"
5838,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,And shift the old burdens our shoulders must bear.
5839,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5840,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Long live the good School! giving out year by year
5841,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Recruits to true manhood and womanhood dear
5842,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Brave boys, modest maidens, in beauty sent forth,"
5843,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,The living epistles and proof of its worth!
5844,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5845,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,In and out let the young life as steadily flow
5846,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,As in broad Narragansett the tides come and go;

5848,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Remember its honor, and guard its renown."
5849,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5850,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Not vainly the gift of its founder was made;
5851,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Not prayerless the stones of its corner were laid
5852,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,The blessing of Him whom in secret they sought
5853,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Has owned the good work which the fathers have wrought.
5854,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
5855,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,To Him be the glory forever! We bear
5856,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,To the Lord of the Harvest our wheat with the tare.

7680,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"especially marked near its southern extremity, by the salt-meadows of"

7725,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7726,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Whence sometimes, when the wind was light"

7730,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Above low scarp and turf-grown wall
7731,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,They saw the fort-flag rise and fall;

7733,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,The lamp-fire glimmer down from the tall light-house tower.
7734,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7735,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"They rested there, escaped awhile"
7736,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"From cares that wear the life away,"
7737,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,To eat the lotus of the Nile
7738,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And drink the poppies of Cathay,--"
7739,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"To fling their loads of custom down,"
7740,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Like drift-weed, on the sand-slopes brown,"
7741,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And in the sea waves drown the restless pack
7742,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Of duties, claims, and needs that barked upon their track."
7743,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7744,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"One, with his beard scarce silvered, bore"
7745,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A ready credence in his looks,"
7746,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A lettered magnate, lording o'er"
7747,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,An ever-widening realm of books.
7748,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"In him brain-currents, near and far,"
7749,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Converged as in a Leyden jar;
7750,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The old, dead authors thronged him round about,"
7751,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And Elzevir's gray ghosts from leathern graves looked out.

7753,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"He knew each living pundit well,"

7757,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"But if he lost, the scenes behind,"
7758,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Somewhat of reverence vague and blind,"
7759,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Finding the actors human at the best,"
7760,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,No readier lips than his the good he saw confessed.
7761,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7762,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"His boyhood fancies not outgrown,"
7763,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He loved himself the singer's art;
7764,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Tenderly, gently, by his own"
7765,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He knew and judged an author's heart.
7766,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,No Rhadamanthine brow of doom
7767,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Bowed the dazed pedant from his room;
7768,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And bards, whose name is legion, if denied,"
7769,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Bore off alike intact their verses and their pride.
7770,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7771,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Pleasant it was to roam about
7772,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The lettered world as he had, done,"

7780,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And one there was, a dreamer born,"
7781,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Who, with a mission to fulfil,"
7782,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Had left the Muses' haunts to turn
7783,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The crank of an opinion-mill,"
7784,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Making his rustic reed of song
7785,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A weapon in the war with wrong,"
7786,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Yoking his fancy to the breaking-plough
7787,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,That beam-deep turned the soil for truth to spring and grow.
7788,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7789,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Too quiet seemed the man to ride

7791,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Was his a voice from side to side
7792,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,To pierce the tumult of the storm?
7793,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A silent, shy, peace-loving man,"
7794,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He seemed no fiery partisan
7795,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"To hold his way against the public frown,"
7796,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The ban of Church and State, the fierce mob's hounding down."
7797,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7798,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,For while he wrought with strenuous will
7799,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The work his hands had found to do,"
7800,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He heard the fitful music still
7801,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Of winds that out of dream-land blew.
7802,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,The din about him could not drown
7803,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,What the strange voices whispered down;
7804,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Along his task-field weird processions swept,"
7805,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,The visionary pomp of stately phantoms stepped:
7806,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7807,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The common air was thick with dreams,--"
7808,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He told them to the toiling crowd;
7809,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Such music as the woods and streams
7810,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Sang in his ear he sang aloud;
7811,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"In still, shut bays, on windy capes,"
7812,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"He heard the call of beckoning shapes,"
7813,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And, as the gray old shadows prompted him,"
7814,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,To homely moulds of rhyme he shaped their legends grim.
7815,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7816,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"He rested now his weary hands,"
7817,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And lightly moralized and laughed,"
7818,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"As, tracing on the shifting sands"
7819,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A burlesque of his paper-craft,"
7820,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He saw the careless waves o'errun
7821,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"His words, as time before had done,"
7822,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Each day's tide-water washing clean away,"
7823,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Like letters from the sand, the work of yesterday."
7824,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7825,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And one, whose Arab face was tanned"
7826,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"By tropic sun and boreal frost,"
7827,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,So travelled there was scarce a land
7828,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Or people left him to exhaust,"
7829,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,In idling mood had from him hurled
7830,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The poor squeezed orange of the world,"
7831,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And in the tent-shade, as beneath a palm,"
7832,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Smoked, cross-legged like a Turk, in Oriental calm."
7833,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7834,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,The very waves that washed the sand
7835,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Below him, he had seen before"
7836,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Whitening the Scandinavian strand
7837,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And sultry Mauritanian shore.
7838,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"From ice-rimmed isles, from summer seas"
7839,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Palm-fringed, they bore him messages;"
7840,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"He heard the plaintive Nubian songs again,"
7841,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And mule-bells tinkling down the mountain-paths of Spain.
7842,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7843,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,His memory round the ransacked earth
7844,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,On Puck's long girdle slid at ease;
7845,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And, instant, to the valley's girth"
7846,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Of mountains, spice isles of the seas,"
7847,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Faith flowered in minster stones, Art's guess"
7848,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"At truth and beauty, found access;"
7849,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Yet loved the while, that free cosmopolite,"
7850,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Old friends, old ways, and kept his boyhood's dreams in sight."
7851,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7852,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Untouched as yet by wealth and pride,"
7853,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,That virgin innocence of beach
7854,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"No shingly monster, hundred-eyed,"
7855,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Stared its gray sand-birds out of reach;
7856,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Unhoused, save where, at intervals,"
7857,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The white tents showed their canvas walls,"
7858,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Where brief sojourners, in the cool, soft air,"
7859,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Forgot their inland heats, hard toil, and year-long care."
7860,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7861,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Sometimes along the wheel-deep sand
7862,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A one-horse wagon slowly crawled,"
7863,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Deep laden with a youthful band,"
7864,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Whose look some homestead old recalled;
7865,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Brother perchance, and sisters twain,"
7866,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And one whose blue eyes told, more plain"
7867,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Than the free language of her rosy lip,"
7868,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Of the still dearer claim of love's relationship.
7869,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7870,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"With cheeks of russet-orchard tint,"
7871,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The light laugh of their native rills,"
7872,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The perfume of their garden's mint,"
7873,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The breezy freedom of the hills,"
7874,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"They bore, in unrestrained delight,"
7875,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The motto of the Garter's knight,"
7876,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Careless as if from every gazing thing
7877,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Hid by their innocence, as Gyges by his ring."
7878,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7879,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The clanging sea-fowl came and went,"
7880,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,The hunter's gun in the marshes rang;
7881,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,At nightfall from a neighboring tent
7882,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,A flute-voiced woman sweetly sang.
7883,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Loose-haired, barefooted, hand-in-hand,"
7884,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Young girls went tripping down the sand;
7885,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And youths and maidens, sitting in the moon,"
7886,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Dreamed o'er the old fond dream from which we wake too soon.
7887,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7888,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"At times their fishing-lines they plied,"
7889,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"With an old Triton at the oar,"
7890,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Salt as the sea-wind, tough and dried"
7891,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,As a lean cusk from Labrador.
7892,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Strange tales he told of wreck and storm,--"
7893,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Had seen the sea-snake's awful form,"
7894,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And heard the ghosts on Haley's Isle complain,"
7895,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Speak him off shore, and beg a passage to old Spain!"
7896,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7897,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And there, on breezy morns, they saw"
7898,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The fishing-schooners outward run,"
7899,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Their low-bent sails in tack and flaw
7900,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Turned white or dark to shade and sun.
7901,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Sometimes, in calms of closing day,"
7902,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"They watched the spectral mirage play,"
7903,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Saw low, far islands looming tall and nigh,"
7904,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And ships, with upturned keels, sail like a sea the sky."
7905,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7906,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Sometimes a cloud, with thunder black,"
7907,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Stooped low upon the darkening main,"
7908,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Piercing the waves along its track
7909,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,With the slant javelins of rain.
7910,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And when west-wind and sunshine warm
7911,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Chased out to sea its wrecks of storm,"
7912,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,They saw the prismy hues in thin spray showers
7913,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Where the green buds of waves burst into white froth flowers.
7914,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7915,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And when along the line of shore
7916,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The mists crept upward chill and damp,"
7917,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Stretched, careless, on their sandy floor"
7918,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Beneath the flaring lantern lamp,"
7919,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"They talked of all things old and new,"
7920,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Read, slept, and dreamed as idlers do;"
7921,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And in the unquestioned freedom of the tent,"
7922,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Body and o'er-taxed mind to healthful ease unbent.
7923,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7924,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Once, when the sunset splendors died,"
7925,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And, trampling up the sloping sand,"
7926,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"In lines outreaching far and wide,"
7927,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The white-waned billows swept to land,"
7928,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Dim seen across the gathering shade,"
7929,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A vast and ghostly cavalcade,"
7930,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"They sat around their lighted kerosene,"
7931,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Hearing the deep bass roar their every pause between.
7932,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
7933,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Then, urged thereto, the Editor"
7934,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Within his full portfolio dipped,"
7935,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Feigning excuse while seaching for
7936,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,(With secret pride) his manuscript.
7937,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"His pale face flushed from eye to beard,"
7938,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"With nervous cough his throat he cleared,"
7939,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And, in a voice so tremulous it betrayed"
7940,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The anxious fondness of an author's heart, he read:"

7950,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Cole, who for a quarter of a century or more was feared, persecuted, and"
7951,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,hated as the witch of Hampton. She lived alone in a hovel a little
7952,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"distant from the spot where the Hampton Academy now stands, and there"
7953,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"she died, unattended. When her death was discovered, she was hastily"
7954,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"covered up in the earth near by, and a stake driven through her body, to"
7955,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,exorcise the evil spirit. Rev. Stephen Bachiler or Batchelder was one of
7956,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,the ablest of the early New England preachers. His marriage late in life
7957,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,to a woman regarded by his church as disreputable induced him to return
7958,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"to England, where he enjoyed the esteem and favor of Oliver Cromwell"

7964,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"When the ebb of the sea has left them free,"
7965,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,To dry their fringes of gold-green moss
7966,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"For there the river comes winding down,"
7967,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"From salt sea-meadows and uplands brown,"
7968,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And waves on the outer rocks afoam
7969,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Shout to its waters, ""Welcome home!"""
7970,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,

7973,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And Agamenticus lifts its blue
7974,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Disk of a cloud the woodlands o'er;

7980,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Once, in the old Colonial days,"
7981,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Two hundred years ago and more,"
7982,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,A boat sailed down through the winding ways
7983,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Of Hampton River to that low shore,"
7984,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Full of a goodly company
7985,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Sailing out on the summer sea,"
7986,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Veering to catch the land-breeze light,"
7987,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,With the Boar to left and the Rocks to right.
7988,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
7989,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"In Hampton meadows, where mowers laid"

7992,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"A young man sighed, who saw them pass."
7993,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Loud laughed his fellows to see him stand
7994,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Whetting his scythe with a listless hand,"
7995,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Hearing a voice in a far-off song,"
7996,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Watching a white hand beckoning long.
7997,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
7998,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""Fie on the witch!"" cried a merry girl,"
7999,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,As they rounded the point where Goody Cole
8000,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Sat by her door with her wheel atwirl,"
8001,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,A bent and blear-eyed poor old soul.
8002,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""Oho!"" she muttered, ""ye 're brave to-day!"
8003,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"But I hear the little waves laugh and say,"
8004,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,'The broth will be cold that waits at home;
8005,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"For it 's one to go, but another to come!'"""
8006,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
8007,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""She's cursed,"" said the skipper; ""speak her fair:"
8008,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,I'm scary always to see her shake
8009,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Her wicked head, with its wild gray hair,"
8010,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"And nose like a hawk, and eyes like a snake."""
8011,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"But merrily still, with laugh and shout,"
8012,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"From Hampton River the boat sailed out,"
8013,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Till the huts and the flakes on Star seemed nigh,"
8014,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And they lost the scent of the pines of Rye.
8015,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
8016,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"They dropped their lines in the lazy tide,"
8017,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Drawing up haddock and mottled cod;
8018,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"They saw not the Shadow that walked beside,"
8019,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,They heard not the feet with silence shod.
8020,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"But thicker and thicker a hot mist grew,"
8021,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Shot by the lightnings through and through;
8022,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"And muffled growls, like the growl of a beast,"
8023,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Ran along the sky from west to east.
8024,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
8025,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Then the skipper looked from the darkening sea
8026,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Up to the dimmed and wading sun;
8027,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"But he spake like a brave man cheerily,"
8028,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""Yet there is time for our homeward run."""
8029,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Veering and tacking, they backward wore;"
8030,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And just as a breath-from the woods ashore
8031,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Blew out to whisper of danger past,"
8032,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The wrath of the storm came down at last!
8033,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
8034,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The skipper hauled at the heavy sail
8035,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""God be our help!"" he only cried,"
8036,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"As the roaring gale, like the stroke of a flail,"
8037,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Smote the boat on its starboard side.
8038,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The Shoalsmen looked, but saw alone"
8039,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Dark films of rain-cloud slantwise blown,"
8040,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Wild rocks lit up by the lightning's glare,"
8041,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The strife and torment of sea and air.
8042,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
8043,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Goody Cole looked out from her door
8044,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The Isles of Shoals were drowned and gone,"
8045,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Scarcely she saw the Head of the Boar
8046,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Toss the foam from tusks of stone.
8047,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"She clasped her hands with a grip of pain,"
8048,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The tear on her cheek was not of rain
8049,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""They are lost,"" she muttered, ""boat and crew!"
8050,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Lord, forgive me! my words were true!"""
8051,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
8052,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Suddenly seaward swept the squall;
8053,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The low sun smote through cloudy rack;
8054,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The Shoals stood clear in the light, and all"
8055,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The trend of the coast lay hard and black.
8056,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"But far and wide as eye could reach,"
8057,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,No life was seen upon wave or beach;
8058,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The boat that went out at morning never
8059,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Sailed back again into Hampton River.
8060,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
8061,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"O mower, lean on thy bended snath,"
8062,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Look from the meadows green and low
8063,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The wind of the sea is a waft of death,"
8064,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The waves are singing a song of woe!
8065,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"By silent river, by moaning sea,"
8066,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Long and vain shall thy watching be
8067,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Never again shall the sweet voice call,"
8068,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Never the white hand rise and fall!
8069,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
8070,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"O Rivermouth Rocks, how sad a sight"
8071,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Ye saw in the light of breaking day
8072,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Dead faces looking up cold and white
8073,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,From sand and seaweed where they lay.
8074,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The mad old witch-wife wailed and wept,"
8075,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And cursed the tide as it backward crept
8076,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""Crawl back, crawl back, blue water-snake"
8077,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Leave your dead for the hearts that break!"""
8078,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
8079,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Solemn it was in that old day
8080,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"In Hampton town and its log-built church,"
8081,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Where side by side the coffins lay
8082,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And the mourners stood in aisle and porch.
8083,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"In the singing-seats young eyes were dim,"
8084,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The voices faltered that raised the hymn,"
8085,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"And Father Dalton, grave and stern,"
8086,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Sobbed through his prayer and wept in turn.
8087,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
8088,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,But his ancient colleague did not pray;
8089,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Under the weight of his fourscore years
8090,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,He stood apart with the iron-gray
8091,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Of his strong brows knitted to hide his tears;
8092,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"And a fair-faced woman of doubtful fame,"
8093,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Linking her own with his honored name,"
8094,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Subtle as sin, at his side withstood"
8095,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The felt reproach of her neighborhood.
8096,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
8097,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Apart with them, like them forbid,"
8098,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Old Goody Cole looked drearily round,"
8099,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"As, two by two, with their faces hid,"
8100,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The mourners walked to the burying-ground.
8101,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,She let the staff from her clasped hands fall
8102,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""Lord, forgive us! we're sinners all!"""
8103,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And the voice of the old man answered her

9822,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,But when morning came he called for his spade.
9823,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""I must pay my debt to the Lord,"" he said."

9899,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
9900,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""The mosques and the domes of scorched Muscat,"

9908,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,
9909,THE CAPTAIN'S WELL.,"""Now the Lord be thanked, I am back again,"
