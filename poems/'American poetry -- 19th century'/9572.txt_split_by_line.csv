61,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
62,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,Where Time the measure of his hours
63,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"By changeful bud and blossom keeps,"
64,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"And, like a young bride crowned with flowers,"
65,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,Fair Shiraz in her garden sleeps;
66,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
67,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Where, to her poet's turban stone,"
68,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"The Spring her gift of flowers imparts,"
69,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,Less sweet than those his thoughts have sown
70,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,In the warm soil of Persian hearts:
71,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
72,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"There sat the stranger, where the shade"
73,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Of scattered date-trees thinly lay,"
74,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,While in the hot clear heaven delayed
75,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,The long and still and weary day.
76,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
77,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Strange trees and fruits above him hung,"
78,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Strange odors filled the sultry air,"
79,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Strange birds upon the branches swung,"
80,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,Strange insect voices murmured there.
81,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
82,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"And strange bright blossoms shone around,"
83,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Turned sunward from the shadowy bowers,"
84,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,As if the Gheber's soul had found
85,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,A fitting home in Iran's flowers.
86,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
87,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Whate'er he saw, whate'er he heard,"
88,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Awakened feelings new and sad,--"
89,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"No Christian garb, nor Christian word,"
90,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Nor church with Sabbath-bell chimes glad,"
91,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
92,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"But Moslem graves, with turban stones,"
93,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"And mosque-spires gleaming white, in view,"
94,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,And graybeard Mollahs in low tones
95,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,Chanting their Koran service through.
96,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
97,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"The flowers which smiled on either hand,"
98,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Like tempting fiends, were such as they"
99,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Which once, o'er all that Eastern land,"
100,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,As gifts on demon altars lay.
101,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
102,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,As if the burning eye of Baal
103,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"The servant of his Conqueror knew,"
104,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"From skies which knew no cloudy veil,"
105,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,The Sun's hot glances smote him through.
106,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
107,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"""Ah me!"" the lonely stranger said,"
108,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"""The hope which led my footsteps on,"
109,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"And light from heaven around them shed,"
110,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"O'er weary wave and waste, is gone!"
111,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
112,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"""Where are the harvest fields all white,"
113,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,For Truth to thrust her sickle in?
114,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Where flock the souls, like doves in flight,"
115,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,From the dark hiding-place of sin?
116,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
117,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"""A silent-horror broods o'er all,--"
118,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"The burden of a hateful spell,--"
119,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,The very flowers around recall
120,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,The hoary magi's rites of hell!
121,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
122,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"""And what am I, o'er such a land"
123,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,The banner of the Cross to bear?
124,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Dear Lord, uphold me with Thy hand,"
125,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Thy strength with human weakness share!"""
126,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
127,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,He ceased; for at his very feet
128,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,In mild rebuke a floweret smiled;
129,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,How thrilled his sinking heart to greet
130,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,The Star-flower of the Virgin's child!
131,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
132,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Sown by some wandering Frank, it drew"
133,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Its life from alien air and earth,"
134,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,And told to Paynim sun and dew
135,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,The story of the Saviour's birth.
136,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
137,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"From scorching beams, in kindly mood,"
138,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"The Persian plants its beauty screened,"
139,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"And on its pagan sisterhood,"
140,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"In love, the Christian floweret leaned."
141,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
142,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,With tears of joy the wanderer felt
143,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,The darkness of his long despair
144,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Before that hallowed symbol melt,"
145,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,Which God's dear love had nurtured there.
146,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
147,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"From Nature's face, that simple flower"
148,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,The lines of sin and sadness swept;
149,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,And Magian pile and Paynim bower
150,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,In peace like that of Eden slept.
151,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
152,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"Each Moslem tomb, and cypress old,"
153,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,Looked holy through the sunset air;
154,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"And, angel-like, the Muezzin told"
155,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,From tower and mosque the hour of prayer.
156,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
157,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,"With cheerful steps, the morrow's dawn"
158,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,From Shiraz saw the stranger part;
159,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,The Star-flower of the Virgin-Born
160,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,Still blooming in his hopeful heart!
161,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,1830.

164,THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM,
165,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN
166,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
167,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"""Get ye up from the wrath of God's terrible day!"
168,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"Ungirded, unsandalled, arise and away!"
169,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"'T is the vintage of blood, 't is the fulness of time,"
170,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"And vengeance shall gather the harvest of crime!"""
171,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
172,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"The warning was spoken--the righteous had gone,"
173,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,And the proud ones of Sodom were feasting alone;
174,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"All gay was the banquet--the revel was long,"
175,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,With the pouring of wine and the breathing of song.
176,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
177,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"'T was an evening of beauty; the air was perfume,"
178,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"The earth was all greenness, the trees were all bloom;"
179,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"And softly the delicate viol was heard,"
180,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,Like the murmur of love or the notes of a bird.
181,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
182,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"And beautiful maidens moved down in the dance,"
183,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,With the magic of motion and sunshine of glance
184,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"And white arms wreathed lightly, and tresses fell free"
185,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,As the plumage of birds in some tropical tree.
186,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
187,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"Where the shrines of foul idols were lighted on high,"
188,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,And wantonness tempted the lust of the eye;
189,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"Midst rites of obsceneness, strange, loathsome, abhorred,"
190,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,The blasphemer scoffed at the name of the Lord.
191,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
192,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"Hark! the growl of the thunder,--the quaking of earth!"
193,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"Woe, woe to the worship, and woe to the mirth!"
194,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,The black sky has opened; there's flame in the air;
195,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,The red arm of vengeance is lifted and bare!
196,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
197,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,Then the shriek of the dying rose wild where the song
198,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,And the low tone of love had been whispered along;
199,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"For the fierce flames went lightly o'er palace and bower,"
200,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"Like the red tongues of demons, to blast and devour!"
201,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
202,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"Down, down on the fallen the red ruin rained,"
203,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,And the reveller sank with his wine-cup undrained;
204,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"The foot of the dancer, the music's loved thrill,"
205,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,And the shout and the laughter grew suddenly still.
206,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
207,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,The last throb of anguish was fearfully given;
208,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,The last eye glared forth in its madness on Heaven!
209,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,"The last groan of horror rose wildly and vain,"
210,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,And death brooded over the pride of the Plain!
211,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,1831.
212,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
213,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
214,THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN,
215,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN
216,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,
217,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Not always as the whirlwind's rush
218,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"On Horeb's mount of fear,"
219,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Not always as the burning bush
220,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"To Midian's shepherd seer,"
221,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Nor as the awful voice which came
222,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"To Israel's prophet bards,"
223,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Nor as the tongues of cloven flame,"
224,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Nor gift of fearful words,--"
225,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,
226,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Not always thus, with outward sign"
227,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Of fire or voice from Heaven,"
228,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"The message of a truth divine,"
229,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,The call of God is given!
230,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Awaking in the human heart
231,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Love for the true and right,--"
232,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Zeal for the Christian's better part,"
233,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Strength for the Christian's fight.
234,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,
235,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Nor unto manhood's heart alone
236,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,The holy influence steals
237,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Warm with a rapture not its own,"
238,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,The heart of woman feels!
239,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,As she who by Samaria's wall
240,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"The Saviour's errand sought,--"
241,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,As those who with the fervent Paul
242,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,And meek Aquila wrought:
243,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,
244,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Or those meek ones whose martyrdom
245,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Rome's gathered grandeur saw
246,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Or those who in their Alpine home
247,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Braved the Crusader's war,"
248,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"When the green Vaudois, trembling, heard,"
249,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Through all its vales of death,"
250,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,The martyr's song of triumph poured
251,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,From woman's failing breath.
252,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,
253,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"And gently, by a thousand things"
254,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Which o'er our spirits pass,"
255,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Like breezes o'er the harp's fine strings,"
256,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Or vapors o'er a glass,"
257,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Leaving their token strange and new
258,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Of music or of shade,"
259,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,The summons to the right and true
260,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,And merciful is made.
261,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,
262,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Oh, then, if gleams of truth and light"
263,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Flash o'er thy waiting mind,"
264,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Unfolding to thy mental sight
265,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,The wants of human-kind;
266,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"If, brooding over human grief,"
267,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,The earnest wish is known
268,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,To soothe and gladden with relief
269,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,An anguish not thine own;
270,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,
271,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Though heralded with naught of fear,"
272,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Or outward sign or show;
273,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Though only to the inward ear
274,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,It whispers soft and low;
275,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Though dropping, as the manna fell,"
276,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Unseen, yet from above,"
277,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,"Noiseless as dew-fall, heed it well,---"
278,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,Thy Father's call of love!
279,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,
280,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,
281,THE CALL OF THE CHRISTIAN,
282,THE CRUCIFIXION.,THE CRUCIFIXION.
283,THE CRUCIFIXION.,
284,THE CRUCIFIXION.,Sunlight upon Judha's hills!
285,THE CRUCIFIXION.,And on the waves of Galilee;
286,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"On Jordan's stream, and on the rills"
287,THE CRUCIFIXION.,That feed the dead and sleeping sea!
288,THE CRUCIFIXION.,Most freshly from the green wood springs
289,THE CRUCIFIXION.,The light breeze on its scented wings;
290,THE CRUCIFIXION.,And gayly quiver in the sun
291,THE CRUCIFIXION.,The cedar tops of Lebanon!
292,THE CRUCIFIXION.,
293,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"A few more hours,--a change hath come!"
294,THE CRUCIFIXION.,The sky is dark without a cloud!
295,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"The shouts of wrath and joy are dumb,"
296,THE CRUCIFIXION.,And proud knees unto earth are bowed.
297,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"A change is on the hill of Death,"
298,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"The helmed watchers pant for breath,"
299,THE CRUCIFIXION.,And turn with wild and maniac eyes
300,THE CRUCIFIXION.,From the dark scene of sacrifice!
301,THE CRUCIFIXION.,
302,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"That Sacrifice!--the death of Him,--"
303,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"The Christ of God, the holy One!"
304,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"Well may the conscious Heaven grow dim,"
305,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"And blacken the beholding, Sun."
306,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"The wonted light hath fled away,"
307,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"Night settles on the middle day,"
308,THE CRUCIFIXION.,And earthquake from his caverned bed
309,THE CRUCIFIXION.,Is waking with a thrill of dread!
310,THE CRUCIFIXION.,
311,THE CRUCIFIXION.,The dead are waking underneath!
312,THE CRUCIFIXION.,Their prison door is rent away!
313,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"And, ghastly with the seal of death,"
314,THE CRUCIFIXION.,They wander in the eye of day!
315,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"The temple of the Cherubim,"
316,THE CRUCIFIXION.,The House of God is cold and dim;
317,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"A curse is on its trembling walls,"
318,THE CRUCIFIXION.,Its mighty veil asunder falls!
319,THE CRUCIFIXION.,
320,THE CRUCIFIXION.,Well may the cavern-depths of Earth
321,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"Be shaken, and her mountains nod;"
322,THE CRUCIFIXION.,Well may the sheeted dead come forth
323,THE CRUCIFIXION.,To see the suffering son of God!
324,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"Well may the temple-shrine grow dim,"
325,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"And shadows veil the Cherubim,"
326,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"When He, the chosen one of Heaven,"
327,THE CRUCIFIXION.,A sacrifice for guilt is given!
328,THE CRUCIFIXION.,
329,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"And shall the sinful heart, alone,"
330,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"Behold unmoved the fearful hour,"
331,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"When Nature trembled on her throne,"
332,THE CRUCIFIXION.,And Death resigned his iron power?
333,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"Oh, shall the heart--whose sinfulness"
334,THE CRUCIFIXION.,"Gave keenness to His sore distress,"
335,THE CRUCIFIXION.,And added to His tears of blood--
336,THE CRUCIFIXION.,Refuse its trembling gratitude!
337,THE CRUCIFIXION.,1834.
338,THE CRUCIFIXION.,
339,THE CRUCIFIXION.,
340,THE CRUCIFIXION.,
341,PALESTINE,PALESTINE
342,PALESTINE,
343,PALESTINE,"Blest land of Judaea! thrice hallowed of song,"
344,PALESTINE,Where the holiest of memories pilgrim-like throng;
345,PALESTINE,"In the shade of thy palms, by the shores of thy sea,"
346,PALESTINE,"On the hills of thy beauty, my heart is with thee."
347,PALESTINE,
348,PALESTINE,With the eye of a spirit I look on that shore
349,PALESTINE,Where pilgrim and prophet have lingered before;
350,PALESTINE,With the glide of a spirit I traverse the sod
351,PALESTINE,Made bright by the steps of the angels of God.
352,PALESTINE,
353,PALESTINE,Blue sea of the hills! in my spirit I hear
354,PALESTINE,"Thy waters, Gennesaret, chime on my ear;"
355,PALESTINE,"Where the Lowly and Just with the people sat down,"
356,PALESTINE,And thy spray on the dust of His sandals was thrown.
357,PALESTINE,
358,PALESTINE,"Beyond are Bethulia's mountains of green,"
359,PALESTINE,And the desolate hills of the wild Gadarene;
360,PALESTINE,And I pause on the goat-crags of Tabor to see
361,PALESTINE,"The gleam of thy waters, O dark Galilee!"
362,PALESTINE,
363,PALESTINE,"Hark, a sound in the valley! where, swollen and strong,"
364,PALESTINE,"Thy river, O Kishon, is sweeping along;"
365,PALESTINE,"Where the Canaanite strove with Jehovah in vain,"
366,PALESTINE,And thy torrent grew dark with the blood of the slain.
367,PALESTINE,
368,PALESTINE,"There down from his mountains stern Zebulon came,"
369,PALESTINE,"And Naphthali's stag, with his eyeballs of flame,"
370,PALESTINE,"And the chariots of Jabin rolled harmlessly on,"
371,PALESTINE,For the arm of the Lord was Abinoam's son!
372,PALESTINE,
373,PALESTINE,There sleep the still rocks and the caverns which rang
374,PALESTINE,"To the song which the beautiful prophetess sang,"
375,PALESTINE,"When the princes of Issachar stood by her side,"
376,PALESTINE,And the shout of a host in its triumph replied.
377,PALESTINE,
378,PALESTINE,"Lo, Bethlehem's hill-site before me is seen,"
379,PALESTINE,"With the mountains around, and the valleys between;"
380,PALESTINE,"There rested the shepherds of Judah, and there"
381,PALESTINE,The song of the angels rose sweet on the air.
382,PALESTINE,
383,PALESTINE,And Bethany's palm-trees in beauty still throw
384,PALESTINE,Their shadows at noon on the ruins below;
385,PALESTINE,But where are the sisters who hastened to greet
386,PALESTINE,"The lowly Redeemer, and sit at His feet?"
387,PALESTINE,
388,PALESTINE,I tread where the twelve in their wayfaring trod;
389,PALESTINE,I stand where they stood with the chosen of God--
390,PALESTINE,"Where His blessing was heard and His lessons were taught,"
391,PALESTINE,Where the blind were restored and the healing was wrought.
392,PALESTINE,
393,PALESTINE,"Oh, here with His flock the sad Wanderer came;"
394,PALESTINE,These hills He toiled over in grief are the same;
395,PALESTINE,"The founts where He drank by the wayside still flow,"
396,PALESTINE,And the same airs are blowing which breathed on His brow!
397,PALESTINE,
398,PALESTINE,"And throned on her hills sits Jerusalem yet,"
399,PALESTINE,"But with dust on her forehead, and chains on her feet;"
400,PALESTINE,"For the crown of her pride to the mocker hath gone,"
401,PALESTINE,And the holy Shechinah is dark where it shone.
402,PALESTINE,
403,PALESTINE,But wherefore this dream of the earthly abode
404,PALESTINE,Of Humanity clothed in the brightness of God?
405,PALESTINE,"Were my spirit but turned from the outward and dim,"
406,PALESTINE,"It could gaze, even now, on the presence of Him!"
407,PALESTINE,
408,PALESTINE,"Not in clouds and in terrors, but gentle as when,"
409,PALESTINE,"In love and in meekness, He moved among men;"
410,PALESTINE,And the voice which breathed peace to the waves of the sea
411,PALESTINE,In the hush of my spirit would whisper to me!

2428,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,
2429,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Still the feet that thither trod,"

2431,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Only Nature, now, and God"
2432,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Have a care for him.
2433,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,
2434,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"There the dews of quiet fall,"
2435,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Singing birds and soft winds stray:
2436,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Shall the tender Heart of all
2437,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Be less kind than they?
2438,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,
2439,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,What he was and what he is
2440,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"They who ask may haply find,"

2449,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Prayer, that, when my day is done,"
2450,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"And I see its setting sun,"
2451,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Shorn and beamless, cold and dim,"
2452,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Sink beneath the horizon's rim,--"
2453,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,When this ball of rock and clay
2454,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Crumbles from my feet away,"
2455,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,And the solid shores of sense
2456,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Melt into the vague immense,"
2457,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Father! I may come to Thee
2458,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Even with the beggar's plea,"

2461,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,
2462,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Not as one who seeks his home
2463,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,With a step assured I come;
2464,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Still behind the tread I hear
2465,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Of my life-companion, Fear;"

2469,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Never shapen nor outlined
2470,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"From myself the fear has grown,"
2471,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,And the shadow is my own.
2472,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,
2473,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Yet, O Lord, through all a sense"
2474,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Of Thy tender providence
2475,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Stays my failing heart on Thee,"
2476,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,And confirms the feeble knee;
2477,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"And, at times, my worn feet press"
2478,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Spaces of cool quietness,"
2479,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Lilied whiteness shone upon
2480,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Not by light of moon or sun.

2490,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Nothing can of chance befall
2491,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Child and seraph, mote and star,"
2492,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Well Thou knowest what we are
2493,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Through Thy vast creative plan
2494,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Looking, from the worm to man,"
2495,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"There is pity in Thine eyes,"
2496,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,But no hatred nor surprise.
2497,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Not in blind caprice of will,"
2498,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Not in cunning sleight of skill,"
2499,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Not for show of power, was wrought"
2500,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Nature's marvel in Thy thought.
2501,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Never careless hand and vain
2502,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Smites these chords of joy and pain;
2503,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,No immortal selfishness
2504,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Plays the game of curse and bless
2505,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Heaven and earth are witnesses
2506,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,That Thy glory goodness is.
2507,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,
2508,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Not for sport of mind and force
2509,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Hast Thou made Thy universe,"
2510,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,But as atmosphere and zone
2511,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Of Thy loving heart alone.
2512,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Man, who walketh in a show,"
2513,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Sees before him, to and fro,"
2514,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Shadow and illusion go;
2515,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"All things flow and fluctuate,"
2516,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Now contract and now dilate.
2517,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"In the welter of this sea,"
2518,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Nothing stable is but Thee;
2519,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"In this whirl of swooning trance,"
2520,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Thou alone art permanence;
2521,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"All without Thee only seems,"
2522,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,All beside is choice of dreams.
2523,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Never yet in darkest mood
2524,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Doubted I that Thou wast good,"
2525,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Nor mistook my will for fate,"
2526,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Pain of sin for heavenly hate,--"
2527,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Never dreamed the gates of pearl
2528,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Rise from out the burning marl,"
2529,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Or that good can only live
2530,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Of the bad conservative,"

2534,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,For myself alone I doubt;
2535,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"All is well, I know, without;"
2536,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"I alone the beauty mar,"
2537,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,I alone the music jar.
2538,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Yet, with hands by evil stained,"
2539,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"And an ear by discord pained,"
2540,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,I am groping for the keys
2541,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Of the heavenly harmonies;
2542,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Still within my heart I bear
2543,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Love for all things good and fair.
2544,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Hands of want or souls in pain
2545,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Have not sought my door in vain;
2546,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,I have kept my fealty good
2547,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,To the human brotherhood;
2548,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Scarcely have I asked in prayer
2549,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,That which others might not share.

2552,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Rich alone in favors lent,"
2553,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Virtuous by accident,"
2554,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Doubtful where I fain would rest,"
2555,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Frailest where I seem the best,"
2556,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Only strong for lack of test,--"
2557,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"What am I, that I should press"
2558,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Special pleas of selfishness,"
2559,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Coolly mounting into heaven
2560,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,On my neighbor unforgiven?
2561,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Ne'er to me, howe'er disguised,"
2562,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Comes a saint unrecognized;
2563,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Never fails my heart to greet
2564,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Noble deed with warmer beat;
2565,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Halt and maimed, I own not less"
2566,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,All the grace of holiness;
2567,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Nor, through shame or self-distrust,"
2568,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Less I love the pure and just.
2569,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Lord, forgive these words of mine"
2570,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,What have I that is not Thine?
2571,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Whatsoe'er I fain would boast
2572,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Needs Thy pitying pardon most.
2573,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Thou, O Elder Brother! who"
2574,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"In Thy flesh our trial knew,"
2575,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Thou, who hast been touched by these"
2576,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Our most sad infirmities,"
2577,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Thou alone the gulf canst span
2578,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"In the dual heart of man,"
2579,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,And between the soul and sense
2580,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Reconcile all difference,"
2581,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Change the dream of me and mine
2582,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"For the truth of Thee and Thine,"

2585,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Haply, thus by Thee renewed,"
2586,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"In Thy borrowed goodness good,"
2587,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Some sweet morning yet in God's
2588,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Dim, veonian periods,"
2589,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Joyful I shall wake to see
2590,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Those I love who rest in Thee,"
2591,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,And to them in Thee allied
2592,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Shall my soul be satisfied.
2593,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,
2594,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Scarcely Hope hath shaped for me
2595,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,What the future life may be.
2596,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Other lips may well be bold;

2602,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Not for me the, crowns of gold,"
2603,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"Palms, and harpings manifold;"

2605,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,Jasper wall and golden street.
2606,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,"What thou wilt, O Father, give I"
2607,ANDREW RYKMAN'S PRAYER,All is gain that I receive.
