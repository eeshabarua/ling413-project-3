44,BARCLAY OF URY.,
45,BARCLAY OF URY.,Among the earliest converts to the doctrines of Friends in Scotland was
46,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Barclay of Ury, an old and distinguished soldier, who had fought under"
47,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Gustavus Adolphus, in Germany. As a Quaker, he became the object of"
48,BARCLAY OF URY.,persecution and abuse at the hands of the magistrates and the populace.
49,BARCLAY OF URY.,None bore the indignities of the mob with greater patience and nobleness
50,BARCLAY OF URY.,"of soul than this once proud gentleman and soldier. One of his friends,"
51,BARCLAY OF URY.,"on an occasion of uncommon rudeness, lamented that he should be treated"
52,BARCLAY OF URY.,"so harshly in his old age who had been so honored before. ""I find more"
53,BARCLAY OF URY.,"satisfaction,"" said Barclay, ""as well as honor, in being thus insulted"
54,BARCLAY OF URY.,"for my religious principles, than when, a few years ago, it was usual"
55,BARCLAY OF URY.,"for the magistrates, as I passed the city of Aberdeen, to meet me on the"
56,BARCLAY OF URY.,"road and conduct me to public entertainment in their hall, and then"
57,BARCLAY OF URY.,"escort me out again, to gain my favor."""
58,BARCLAY OF URY.,
59,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Up the streets of Aberdeen,"
60,BARCLAY OF URY.,"By the kirk and college green,"
61,BARCLAY OF URY.,Rode the Laird of Ury;
62,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Close behind him, close beside,"
63,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Foul of mouth and evil-eyed,"
64,BARCLAY OF URY.,Pressed the mob in fury.
65,BARCLAY OF URY.,
66,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Flouted him the drunken churl,"
67,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Jeered at him the serving-girl,"
68,BARCLAY OF URY.,Prompt to please her master;
69,BARCLAY OF URY.,"And the begging carlin, late"
70,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Fed and clothed at Ury's gate,"
71,BARCLAY OF URY.,Cursed him as he passed her.
72,BARCLAY OF URY.,
73,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Yet, with calm and stately mien,"
74,BARCLAY OF URY.,Up the streets of Aberdeen
75,BARCLAY OF URY.,Came he slowly riding;
76,BARCLAY OF URY.,"And, to all he saw and heard,"
77,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Answering not with bitter word,"
78,BARCLAY OF URY.,Turning not for chiding.
79,BARCLAY OF URY.,
80,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Came a troop with broadswords swinging,"
81,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Bits and bridles sharply ringing,"
82,BARCLAY OF URY.,Loose and free and froward;
83,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Quoth the foremost, ""Ride him down!"
84,BARCLAY OF URY.,Push him! prick him! through the town
85,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Drive the Quaker coward!"""
86,BARCLAY OF URY.,
87,BARCLAY OF URY.,But from out the thickening crowd
88,BARCLAY OF URY.,Cried a sudden voice and loud
89,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Barclay! Ho! a Barclay!"""
90,BARCLAY OF URY.,And the old man at his side
91,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Saw a comrade, battle tried,"
92,BARCLAY OF URY.,Scarred and sunburned darkly;
93,BARCLAY OF URY.,
94,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Who with ready weapon bare,"
95,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Fronting to the troopers there,"
96,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Cried aloud: ""God save us,"
97,BARCLAY OF URY.,Call ye coward him who stood
98,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Ankle deep in Lutzen's blood,"
99,BARCLAY OF URY.,"With the brave Gustavus?"""
100,BARCLAY OF URY.,
101,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Nay, I do not need thy sword,"
102,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Comrade mine,"" said Ury's lord;"
103,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Put it up, I pray thee"
104,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Passive to His holy will,"
105,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Trust I in my Master still,"
106,BARCLAY OF URY.,Even though He slay me.
107,BARCLAY OF URY.,
108,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Pledges of thy love and faith,"
109,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Proved on many a field of death,"
110,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Not by me are needed."""
111,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Marvelled much that henchman bold,"
112,BARCLAY OF URY.,"That his laird, so stout of old,"
113,BARCLAY OF URY.,Now so meekly pleaded.
114,BARCLAY OF URY.,
115,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Woe's the day!"" he sadly said,"
116,BARCLAY OF URY.,"With a slowly shaking head,"
117,BARCLAY OF URY.,And a look of pity;
118,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Ury's honest lord reviled,"
119,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Mock of knave and sport of child,"
120,BARCLAY OF URY.,In his own good city.
121,BARCLAY OF URY.,
122,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Speak the word, and, master mine,"
123,BARCLAY OF URY.,"As we charged on Tilly's[8] line,"
124,BARCLAY OF URY.,"And his Walloon lancers,"
125,BARCLAY OF URY.,Smiting through their midst we'll teach
126,BARCLAY OF URY.,Civil look and decent speech
127,BARCLAY OF URY.,"To these boyish prancers!"""
128,BARCLAY OF URY.,
129,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Marvel not, mine ancient friend,"
130,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Like beginning, like the end:"""
131,BARCLAY OF URY.,Quoth the Laird of Ury;
132,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Is the sinful servant more"
133,BARCLAY OF URY.,Than his gracious Lord who bore
134,BARCLAY OF URY.,Bonds and stripes in Jewry?
135,BARCLAY OF URY.,
136,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Give me joy that in His name"
137,BARCLAY OF URY.,"I can bear, with patient frame,"
138,BARCLAY OF URY.,All these vain ones offer;
139,BARCLAY OF URY.,"While for them He suffereth long,"
140,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Shall I answer wrong with wrong,"
141,BARCLAY OF URY.,Scoffing with the scoffer?
142,BARCLAY OF URY.,
143,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Happier I, with loss of all,"
144,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Hunted, outlawed, held in thrall,"
145,BARCLAY OF URY.,"With few friends to greet me,"
146,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Than when reeve and squire were seen,"
147,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Riding out from Aberdeen,"
148,BARCLAY OF URY.,With bared heads to meet me.
149,BARCLAY OF URY.,
150,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""When each goodwife, o'er and o'er,"
151,BARCLAY OF URY.,Blessed me as I passed her door;
152,BARCLAY OF URY.,"And the snooded daughter,"
153,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Through her casement glancing down,"
154,BARCLAY OF URY.,Smiled on him who bore renown
155,BARCLAY OF URY.,From red fields of slaughter.
156,BARCLAY OF URY.,
157,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Hard to feel the stranger's scoff,"
158,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Hard the old friend's falling off,"
159,BARCLAY OF URY.,Hard to learn forgiving;
160,BARCLAY OF URY.,"But the Lord His own rewards,"
161,BARCLAY OF URY.,"And His love with theirs accords,"
162,BARCLAY OF URY.,Warm and fresh and living.
163,BARCLAY OF URY.,
164,BARCLAY OF URY.,"""Through this dark and stormy night"
165,BARCLAY OF URY.,Faith beholds a feeble light
166,BARCLAY OF URY.,Up the blackness streaking;
167,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Knowing God's own time is best,"
168,BARCLAY OF URY.,In a patient hope I rest
169,BARCLAY OF URY.,"For the full day-breaking!"""
170,BARCLAY OF URY.,
171,BARCLAY OF URY.,"So the Laird of Ury said,"
172,BARCLAY OF URY.,Turning slow his horse's head
173,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Towards the Tolbooth prison,"
174,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Where, through iron gates, he heard"
175,BARCLAY OF URY.,Poor disciples of the Word
176,BARCLAY OF URY.,Preach of Christ arisen!
177,BARCLAY OF URY.,
178,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Not in vain, Confessor old,"
179,BARCLAY OF URY.,Unto us the tale is told
180,BARCLAY OF URY.,Of thy day of trial;
181,BARCLAY OF URY.,Every age on him who strays
182,BARCLAY OF URY.,From its broad and beaten ways
183,BARCLAY OF URY.,Pours its seven-fold vial.
184,BARCLAY OF URY.,
185,BARCLAY OF URY.,Happy he whose inward ear
186,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Angel comfortings can hear,"
187,BARCLAY OF URY.,O'er the rabble's laughter;
188,BARCLAY OF URY.,"And while Hatred's fagots burn,"
189,BARCLAY OF URY.,Glimpses through the smoke discern
190,BARCLAY OF URY.,Of the good hereafter.
191,BARCLAY OF URY.,
192,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Knowing this, that never yet"
193,BARCLAY OF URY.,Share of Truth was vainly set
194,BARCLAY OF URY.,In the world's wide fallow;
195,BARCLAY OF URY.,"After hands shall sow the seed,"
196,BARCLAY OF URY.,After hands from hill and mead
197,BARCLAY OF URY.,Reap the harvests yellow.
198,BARCLAY OF URY.,
199,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Thus, with somewhat of the Seer,"
200,BARCLAY OF URY.,Must the moral pioneer
201,BARCLAY OF URY.,From the Future borrow;
202,BARCLAY OF URY.,"Clothe the waste with dreams of grain,"
203,BARCLAY OF URY.,"And, on midnight's sky of rain,"
204,BARCLAY OF URY.,Paint the golden morrow!

210,THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA.,
211,THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA.,"A letter-writer from Mexico during the Mexican war, when detailing some"
212,THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA.,"of the incidents at the terrible fight of Buena Vista, mentioned that"
213,THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA.,"Mexican women were seen hovering near the field of death, for the"
214,THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA.,purpose of giving aid and succor to the wounded. One poor woman was
215,THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA.,"found surrounded by the maimed and suffering of both armies, ministering"
216,THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA.,"to the wants of Americans as well as Mexicans, with impartial"
217,THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA.,tenderness.
218,THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA.,

694,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,
695,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,The incident upon which this poem is based is related in a note to
696,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Bernardin Henri Saint Pierre's Etudes de la Nature. ""We arrived at the"
697,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"habitation of the Hermits a little before they sat down to their table,"
698,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,and while they were still at church. J. J. Rousseau proposed to me to
699,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,offer up our devotions. The hermits were reciting the Litanies of
700,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Providence, which are remarkably beautiful. After we had addressed our"
701,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"prayers to God, and the hermits were proceeding to the refectory,"
702,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Rousseau said to me, with his heart overflowing, 'At this moment I"
703,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,experience what is said in the gospel: Where two or three are gathered
704,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. There is here a"
705,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"feeling of peace and happiness which penetrates the soul.' I said, 'If"
706,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Finelon had lived, you would have been a Catholic.' He exclaimed, with"
707,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"tears in his eyes, 'Oh, if Finelon were alive, I would struggle to get"
708,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"into his service, even as a lackey!'"" In my sketch of Saint Pierre, it"
709,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,will be seen that I have somewhat antedated the period of his old age.
710,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"At that time he was not probably more than fifty. In describing him, I"
711,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,have by no means exaggerated his own history of his mental condition at
712,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,the period of the story. In the fragmentary Sequel to his Studies of
713,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Nature, he thus speaks of himself: ""The ingratitude of those of whom I"
714,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"had deserved kindness, unexpected family misfortunes, the total loss of"
715,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,my small patrimony through enterprises solely undertaken for the benefit
716,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"of my country, the debts under which I lay oppressed, the blasting of"
717,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"all my hopes,--these combined calamities made dreadful inroads upon my"
718,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,health and reason. . . . I found it impossible to continue in a room
719,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"where there was company, especially if the doors were shut. I could not"
720,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"even cross an alley in a public garden, if several persons had got"
721,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"together in it. When alone, my malady subsided. I felt myself likewise"
722,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,at ease in places where I saw children only. At the sight of any one
723,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"walking up to the place where I was, I felt my whole frame agitated, and"
724,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"retired. I often said to myself, 'My sole study has been to merit well"
725,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"of mankind; why do I fear them?'"""
726,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,
727,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,He attributes his improved health of mind and body to the counsels of
728,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"his friend, J. J. Rousseau. ""I renounced,"" says he, ""my books. I threw"
729,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"my eyes upon the works of nature, which spake to all my senses a"
730,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,language which neither time nor nations have it in their power to alter.
731,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,Thenceforth my histories and my journals were the herbage of the fields
732,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"and meadows. My thoughts did not go forth painfully after them, as in"
733,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"the case of human systems; but their thoughts, under a thousand engaging"
734,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"forms, quietly sought me. In these I studied, without effort, the laws"
735,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"of that Universal Wisdom which had surrounded me from the cradle, but on"
736,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"which heretofore I had bestowed little attention."""
737,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,
738,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Speaking of Rousseau, he says: ""I derived inexpressible satisfaction"
739,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,from his society. What I prized still more than his genius was his
740,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"probity. He was one of the few literary characters, tried in the furnace"
741,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"of affliction, to whom you could, with perfect security, confide your"
742,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"most secret thoughts. . . . Even when he deviated, and became the victim"
743,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"of himself or of others, he could forget his own misery in devotion to"
744,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,the welfare of mankind. He was uniformly the advocate of the miserable.
745,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,There might be inscribed on his tomb these affecting words from that
746,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Book of which he carried always about him some select passages, during"
747,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"the last years of his life: 'His sins, which are many, are forgiven, for"

2301,THE GIFT OF TRITEMIUS.,Thereat the Abbot paused; the chain whereby

2351,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,
2352,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,"In the valuable and carefully prepared History of Marblehead, published"
2353,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,"in 1879 by Samuel Roads, Jr., it is stated that the crew of Captain"
2354,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,"Ireson, rather than himself, were responsible for the abandonment of the"
2355,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,disabled vessel. To screen themselves they charged their captain with
2356,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,the crime. In view of this the writer of the ballad addressed the
2357,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,following letter to the historian:--
2358,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,
2359,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,"OAK KNOLL, DANVERS, 5 mo. 18, 1880."
2360,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,MY DEAR FRIEND: I heartily thank thee for a copy of thy History of
2361,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,Marblehead. I have read it with great interest and think good use has
2362,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,been made of the abundant material. No town in Essex County has a record
2363,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,more honorable than Marblehead; no one has done more to develop the
2364,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,"industrial interests of our New England seaboard, and certainly none"
2365,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,have given such evidence of self-sacrificing patriotism. I am glad the
2366,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,"story of it has been at last told, and told so well. I have now no doubt"
2367,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,that thy version of Skipper Ireson's ride is the correct one. My verse
2368,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,was founded solely on a fragment of rhyme which I heard from one of my
2369,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,"early schoolmates, a native of Marblehead. I supposed the story to which"
2370,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,it referred dated back at least a century. I knew nothing of the
2371,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,"participators, and the narrative of the ballad was pure fancy. I am glad"
2372,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,for the sake of truth and justice that the real facts are given in thy
2373,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,"book. I certainly would not knowingly do injustice to any one, dead or"
2374,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,living.
