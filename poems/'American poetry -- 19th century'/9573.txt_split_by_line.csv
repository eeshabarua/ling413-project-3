165,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
166,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,O friends! with whom my feet have trod
167,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"The quiet aisles of prayer,"
168,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Glad witness to your zeal for God
169,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,And love of man I bear.
170,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
171,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,I trace your lines of argument;
172,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Your logic linked and strong
173,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"I weigh as one who dreads dissent,"
174,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,And fears a doubt as wrong.
175,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
176,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,But still my human hands are weak
177,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,To hold your iron creeds
178,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Against the words ye bid me speak
179,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,My heart within me pleads.
180,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
181,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Who fathoms the Eternal Thought?
182,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Who talks of scheme and plan?
183,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,The Lord is God! He needeth not
184,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,The poor device of man.
185,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
186,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"I walk with bare, hushed feet the ground"
187,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Ye tread with boldness shod;
188,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,I dare not fix with mete and bound
189,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,The love and power of God.
190,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
191,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Ye praise His justice; even such
192,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,His pitying love I deem
193,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Ye seek a king; I fain would touch
194,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,The robe that hath no seam.
195,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
196,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Ye see the curse which overbroods
197,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,A world of pain and loss;
198,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,I hear our Lord's beatitudes
199,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,And prayer upon the cross.
200,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
201,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"More than your schoolmen teach, within"
202,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"Myself, alas! I know"
203,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"Too dark ye cannot paint the sin,"
204,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Too small the merit show.

206,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"I bow my forehead to the dust,"

208,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"And urge, in trembling self-distrust,"
209,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,A prayer without a claim.
210,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
211,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"I see the wrong that round me lies,"
212,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,I feel the guilt within;
213,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"I hear, with groan and travail-cries,"
214,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,The world confess its sin.
215,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
216,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"Yet, in the maddening maze of things,"
217,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"And tossed by storm and flood,"
218,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,To one fixed trust my spirit clings;
219,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,I know that God is good!
220,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
221,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Not mine to look where cherubim
222,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"And seraphs may not see,"
223,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,But nothing can be good in Him
224,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Which evil is in me.
225,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
226,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,The wrong that pains my soul below
227,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"I dare not throne above,"
228,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"I know not of His hate,--I know"
229,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,His goodness and His love.
230,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
231,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,I dimly guess from blessings known
232,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"Of greater out of sight,"
233,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"And, with the chastened Psalmist, own"
234,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,His judgments too are right.
235,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
236,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"I long for household voices gone,"
237,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"For vanished smiles I long,"

240,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
241,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,I know not what the future hath
242,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"Of marvel or surprise,"
243,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Assured alone that life and death
244,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,His mercy underlies.
245,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
246,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,And if my heart and flesh are weak
247,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"To bear an untried pain,"
248,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"The bruised reed He will not break,"
249,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,But strengthen and sustain.
250,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
251,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"No offering of my own I have,"
252,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Nor works my faith to prove;
253,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"I can but give the gifts He gave,"
254,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,And plead His love for love.
255,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
256,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,And so beside the Silent Sea
257,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,I wait the muffled oar;
258,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,No harm from Him can come to me
259,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,On ocean or on shore.
260,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
261,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,I know not where His islands lift
262,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Their fronded palms in air;
263,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,I only know I cannot drift
264,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Beyond His love and care.
265,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
266,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"O brothers! if my faith is vain,"
267,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"If hopes like these betray,"
268,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Pray for me that my feet may gain
269,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,The sure and safer way.
270,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,
271,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"And Thou, O Lord! by whom are seen"
272,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,"Thy creatures as they be,"
273,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,Forgive me if too close I lean
274,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS.,My human heart on Thee!

312,THE COMMON QUESTION.,The vague desire can stay;

318,THE COMMON QUESTION.,And what we blindly ask of Him
319,THE COMMON QUESTION.,His love withholds or grants.
320,THE COMMON QUESTION.,
321,THE COMMON QUESTION.,And so I sometimes think our prayers
322,THE COMMON QUESTION.,Might well be merged in one;
323,THE COMMON QUESTION.,And nest and perch and hearth and church
324,THE COMMON QUESTION.,"Repeat, ""Thy will be done."""

503,OUR MASTER.,His brothers and Thy own.
504,OUR MASTER.,
505,OUR MASTER.,"Thy litanies, sweet offices"

523,THE MEETING.,THE MEETING.
524,THE MEETING.,
525,THE MEETING.,The two speakers in the meeting referred to in this poem were Avis
526,THE MEETING.,"Keene, whose very presence was a benediction, a woman lovely in"
527,THE MEETING.,"spirit and person, whose words seemed a message of love and tender"
528,THE MEETING.,"concern to her hearers; and Sibyl Jones, whose inspired eloquence"
529,THE MEETING.,and rare spirituality impressed all who knew her. In obedience to
530,THE MEETING.,her apprehended duty she made visits of Christian love to various
531,THE MEETING.,"parts of Europe, and to the West Coast of Africa and Palestine."
532,THE MEETING.,
533,THE MEETING.,"The elder folks shook hands at last,"
534,THE MEETING.,Down seat by seat the signal passed.
535,THE MEETING.,"To simple ways like ours unused,"
536,THE MEETING.,"Half solemnized and half amused,"
537,THE MEETING.,"With long-drawn breath and shrug, my guest"
538,THE MEETING.,His sense of glad relief expressed.
539,THE MEETING.,"Outside, the hills lay warm in sun;"
540,THE MEETING.,The cattle in the meadow-run
541,THE MEETING.,Stood half-leg deep; a single bird
542,THE MEETING.,The green repose above us stirred.
543,THE MEETING.,"""What part or lot have you,"" he said,"
544,THE MEETING.,"""In these dull rites of drowsy-head?"
545,THE MEETING.,Is silence worship? Seek it where
546,THE MEETING.,"It soothes with dreams the summer air,"
547,THE MEETING.,"Not in this close and rude-benched hall,"
548,THE MEETING.,"But where soft lights and shadows fall,"
549,THE MEETING.,"And all the slow, sleep-walking hours"
550,THE MEETING.,Glide soundless over grass and flowers!
551,THE MEETING.,"From time and place and form apart,"
552,THE MEETING.,"Its holy ground the human heart,"
553,THE MEETING.,Nor ritual-bound nor templeward
554,THE MEETING.,Walks the free spirit of the Lord!
555,THE MEETING.,Our common Master did not pen
556,THE MEETING.,His followers up from other men;
557,THE MEETING.,"His service liberty indeed,"
558,THE MEETING.,"He built no church, He framed no creed;"
559,THE MEETING.,But while the saintly Pharisee
560,THE MEETING.,"Made broader his phylactery,"
561,THE MEETING.,As from the synagogue was seen
562,THE MEETING.,The dusty-sandalled Nazarene
563,THE MEETING.,Through ripening cornfields lead the way
564,THE MEETING.,"Upon the awful Sabbath day,"
565,THE MEETING.,His sermons were the healthful talk
566,THE MEETING.,"That shorter made the mountain-walk,"
567,THE MEETING.,"His wayside texts were flowers and birds,"
568,THE MEETING.,Where mingled with His gracious words
569,THE MEETING.,The rustle of the tamarisk-tree
570,THE MEETING.,"And ripple-wash of Galilee."""
571,THE MEETING.,
572,THE MEETING.,"""Thy words are well, O friend,"" I said;"
573,THE MEETING.,"""Unmeasured and unlimited,"
574,THE MEETING.,"With noiseless slide of stone to stone,"
575,THE MEETING.,The mystic Church of God has grown.
576,THE MEETING.,Invisible and silent stands
577,THE MEETING.,"The temple never made with hands,"
578,THE MEETING.,Unheard the voices still and small
579,THE MEETING.,Of its unseen confessional.
580,THE MEETING.,He needs no special place of prayer
581,THE MEETING.,Whose hearing ear is everywhere;
582,THE MEETING.,He brings not back the childish days
583,THE MEETING.,"That ringed the earth with stones of praise,"
584,THE MEETING.,"Roofed Karnak's hall of gods, and laid"
585,THE MEETING.,The plinths of Phil e's colonnade.
586,THE MEETING.,Still less He owns the selfish good
587,THE MEETING.,"And sickly growth of solitude,--"
588,THE MEETING.,"The worthless grace that, out of sight,"
589,THE MEETING.,Flowers in the desert anchorite;
590,THE MEETING.,"Dissevered from the suffering whole,"
591,THE MEETING.,Love hath no power to save a soul.
592,THE MEETING.,"Not out of Self, the origin"
593,THE MEETING.,"And native air and soil of sin,"
594,THE MEETING.,"The living waters spring and flow,"
595,THE MEETING.,The trees with leaves of healing grow.
596,THE MEETING.,
597,THE MEETING.,"""Dream not, O friend, because I seek"
598,THE MEETING.,"This quiet shelter twice a week,"
599,THE MEETING.,I better deem its pine-laid floor
600,THE MEETING.,Than breezy hill or sea-sung shore;
601,THE MEETING.,But nature is not solitude
602,THE MEETING.,She crowds us with her thronging wood;
603,THE MEETING.,"Her many hands reach out to us,"
604,THE MEETING.,Her many tongues are garrulous;
605,THE MEETING.,Perpetual riddles of surprise
606,THE MEETING.,She offers to our ears and eyes;
607,THE MEETING.,"She will not leave our senses still,"
608,THE MEETING.,But drags them captive at her will
609,THE MEETING.,"And, making earth too great for heaven,"
610,THE MEETING.,She hides the Giver in the given.
611,THE MEETING.,
612,THE MEETING.,"""And so, I find it well to come"
613,THE MEETING.,"For deeper rest to this still room,"
614,THE MEETING.,For here the habit of the soul
615,THE MEETING.,Feels less the outer world's control;
616,THE MEETING.,The strength of mutual purpose pleads
617,THE MEETING.,More earnestly our common needs;
618,THE MEETING.,And from the silence multiplied
619,THE MEETING.,"By these still forms on either side,"
620,THE MEETING.,The world that time and sense have known
621,THE MEETING.,Falls off and leaves us God alone.
622,THE MEETING.,
623,THE MEETING.,"""Yet rarely through the charmed repose"
624,THE MEETING.,"Unmixed the stream of motive flows,"
625,THE MEETING.,"A flavor of its many springs,"
626,THE MEETING.,The tints of earth and sky it brings;
627,THE MEETING.,In the still waters needs must be
628,THE MEETING.,Some shade of human sympathy;
629,THE MEETING.,"And here, in its accustomed place,"
630,THE MEETING.,I look on memory's dearest face;
631,THE MEETING.,The blind by-sitter guesseth not
632,THE MEETING.,What shadow haunts that vacant spot;
633,THE MEETING.,No eyes save mine alone can see
634,THE MEETING.,The love wherewith it welcomes me!
635,THE MEETING.,"And still, with those alone my kin,"
636,THE MEETING.,"In doubt and weakness, want and sin,"
637,THE MEETING.,"I bow my head, my heart I bare"
638,THE MEETING.,"As when that face was living there,"
639,THE MEETING.,"And strive (too oft, alas! in vain)"
640,THE MEETING.,"The peace of simple trust to gain,"
641,THE MEETING.,"Fold fancy's restless wings, and lay"
642,THE MEETING.,The idols of my heart away.
643,THE MEETING.,
644,THE MEETING.,"""Welcome the silence all unbroken,"
645,THE MEETING.,"Nor less the words of fitness spoken,--"
646,THE MEETING.,Such golden words as hers for whom
647,THE MEETING.,Our autumn flowers have just made room;
648,THE MEETING.,Whose hopeful utterance through and through
649,THE MEETING.,The freshness of the morning blew;
650,THE MEETING.,Who loved not less the earth that light
651,THE MEETING.,"Fell on it from the heavens in sight,"
652,THE MEETING.,But saw in all fair forms more fair
653,THE MEETING.,The Eternal beauty mirrored there.
654,THE MEETING.,Whose eighty years but added grace
655,THE MEETING.,"And saintlier meaning to her face,--"
656,THE MEETING.,The look of one who bore away
657,THE MEETING.,"Glad tidings from the hills of day,"
658,THE MEETING.,While all our hearts went forth to meet
659,THE MEETING.,The coming of her beautiful feet!
660,THE MEETING.,"Or haply hers, whose pilgrim tread"
661,THE MEETING.,Is in the paths where Jesus led;
662,THE MEETING.,Who dreams her childhood's Sabbath dream
663,THE MEETING.,"By Jordan's willow-shaded stream,"
664,THE MEETING.,"And, of the hymns of hope and faith,"
665,THE MEETING.,"Sung by the monks of Nazareth,"
666,THE MEETING.,"Hears pious echoes, in the call"
667,THE MEETING.,"To prayer, from Moslem minarets fall,"
668,THE MEETING.,Repeating where His works were wrought
669,THE MEETING.,"The lesson that her Master taught,"
670,THE MEETING.,"Of whom an elder Sibyl gave,"
671,THE MEETING.,The prophecies of Cuma 's cave.
672,THE MEETING.,
673,THE MEETING.,"""I ask no organ's soulless breath"
674,THE MEETING.,"To drone the themes of life and death,"
675,THE MEETING.,"No altar candle-lit by day,"
676,THE MEETING.,"No ornate wordsman's rhetoric-play,"
677,THE MEETING.,No cool philosophy to teach
678,THE MEETING.,Its bland audacities of speech
679,THE MEETING.,To double-tasked idolaters
680,THE MEETING.,"Themselves their gods and worshippers,"
681,THE MEETING.,No pulpit hammered by the fist
682,THE MEETING.,"Of loud-asserting dogmatist,"
683,THE MEETING.,Who borrows for the Hand of love
684,THE MEETING.,The smoking thunderbolts of Jove.
685,THE MEETING.,"I know how well the fathers taught,"
686,THE MEETING.,What work the later schoolmen wrought;
687,THE MEETING.,"I reverence old-time faith and men,"
688,THE MEETING.,But God is near us now as then;
689,THE MEETING.,"His force of love is still unspent,"
690,THE MEETING.,His hate of sin as imminent;
691,THE MEETING.,And still the measure of our needs
692,THE MEETING.,Outgrows the cramping bounds of creeds;
693,THE MEETING.,The manna gathered yesterday
694,THE MEETING.,Already savors of decay;
695,THE MEETING.,Doubts to the world's child-heart unknown
696,THE MEETING.,Question us now from star and stone;
697,THE MEETING.,"Too little or too much we know,"
698,THE MEETING.,And sight is swift and faith is slow;
699,THE MEETING.,The power is lost to self-deceive
700,THE MEETING.,With shallow forms of make-believe.
701,THE MEETING.,"W e walk at high noon, and the bells"
702,THE MEETING.,"Call to a thousand oracles,"
703,THE MEETING.,"But the sound deafens, and the light"
704,THE MEETING.,Is stronger than our dazzled sight;
705,THE MEETING.,The letters of the sacred Book
706,THE MEETING.,Glimmer and swim beneath our look;
707,THE MEETING.,Still struggles in the Age's breast
708,THE MEETING.,With deepening agony of quest
709,THE MEETING.,"The old entreaty: 'Art thou He,"
710,THE MEETING.,Or look we for the Christ to be?'
711,THE MEETING.,
712,THE MEETING.,"""God should be most where man is least"
713,THE MEETING.,"So, where is neither church nor priest,"
714,THE MEETING.,And never rag of form or creed
715,THE MEETING.,"To clothe the nakedness of need,--"
716,THE MEETING.,"Where farmer-folk in silence meet,--"
717,THE MEETING.,I turn my bell-unsummoned feet;'
718,THE MEETING.,"I lay the critic's glass aside,"
719,THE MEETING.,"I tread upon my lettered pride,"
720,THE MEETING.,"And, lowest-seated, testify"
721,THE MEETING.,To the oneness of humanity;
722,THE MEETING.,"Confess the universal want,"
723,THE MEETING.,And share whatever Heaven may grant.
724,THE MEETING.,"He findeth not who seeks his own,"
725,THE MEETING.,The soul is lost that's saved alone.
726,THE MEETING.,Not on one favored forehead fell
727,THE MEETING.,"Of old the fire-tongued miracle,"
728,THE MEETING.,But flamed o'er all the thronging host
729,THE MEETING.,The baptism of the Holy Ghost;
730,THE MEETING.,Heart answers heart: in one desire
731,THE MEETING.,The blending lines of prayer aspire;
732,THE MEETING.,"'Where, in my name, meet two or three,'"
733,THE MEETING.,"Our Lord hath said, 'I there will be!'"
734,THE MEETING.,
735,THE MEETING.,"""So sometimes comes to soul and sense"
736,THE MEETING.,The feeling which is evidence
737,THE MEETING.,That very near about us lies
738,THE MEETING.,The realm of spiritual mysteries.
739,THE MEETING.,The sphere of the supernal powers
740,THE MEETING.,Impinges on this world of ours.
741,THE MEETING.,"The low and dark horizon lifts,"
742,THE MEETING.,To light the scenic terror shifts;
743,THE MEETING.,The breath of a diviner air
744,THE MEETING.,Blows down the answer of a prayer
745,THE MEETING.,"That all our sorrow, pain, and doubt"
746,THE MEETING.,"A great compassion clasps about,"
747,THE MEETING.,"And law and goodness, love and force,"
748,THE MEETING.,Are wedded fast beyond divorce.
749,THE MEETING.,"Then duty leaves to love its task,"
750,THE MEETING.,The beggar Self forgets to ask;
751,THE MEETING.,"With smile of trust and folded hands,"
752,THE MEETING.,The passive soul in waiting stands
753,THE MEETING.,"To feel, as flowers the sun and dew,"
754,THE MEETING.,The One true Life its own renew.
755,THE MEETING.,
756,THE MEETING.,"""So, to the calmly gathered thought"
757,THE MEETING.,"The innermost of truth is taught,"
758,THE MEETING.,"The mystery dimly understood,"
759,THE MEETING.,"That love of God is love of good,"
760,THE MEETING.,"And, chiefly, its divinest trace"
761,THE MEETING.,In Him of Nazareth's holy face;
762,THE MEETING.,"That to be saved is only this,--"
763,THE MEETING.,"Salvation from our selfishness,"
764,THE MEETING.,"From more than elemental fire,"
765,THE MEETING.,"The soul's unsanetified desire,"
766,THE MEETING.,"From sin itself, and not the pain"
767,THE MEETING.,That warns us of its chafing chain;
768,THE MEETING.,That worship's deeper meaning lies
769,THE MEETING.,"In mercy, and not sacrifice,"
770,THE MEETING.,Not proud humilities of sense
771,THE MEETING.,"And posturing of penitence,"
772,THE MEETING.,But love's unforced obedience;
773,THE MEETING.,That Book and Church and Day are given
774,THE MEETING.,"For man, not God,--for earth, not heaven,--"
775,THE MEETING.,"The blessed means to holiest ends,"
776,THE MEETING.,"Not masters, but benignant friends;"
777,THE MEETING.,"That the dear Christ dwells not afar,"
778,THE MEETING.,"The king of some remoter star,"
779,THE MEETING.,"Listening, at times, with flattered ear"
780,THE MEETING.,"To homage wrung from selfish fear,"
781,THE MEETING.,"But here, amidst the poor and blind,"
782,THE MEETING.,"The bound and suffering of our kind,"
