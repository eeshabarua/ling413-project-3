89,II.,
90,II.,
91,II.,
92,II.,They ran through the streets of the seaport town;
93,II.,They peered from the decks of the ships that lay:
94,II.,The cold sea-fog that came whitening down
95,II.,Was never as cold or white as they.
96,II.,"""Ho, Starbuck and Pinckney and Tenterden!"
97,II.,"Run for your shallops, gather your men,"
98,II.,"Scatter your boats on the lower bay."""
99,II.,
100,II.,Good cause for fear! In the thick midday
101,II.,"The hulk that lay by the rotting pier,"
102,II.,"Filled with the children in happy play,"
103,II.,"Parted its moorings, and drifted clear,--"
104,II.,"Drifted clear beyond the reach or call,--"
105,II.,"Thirteen children they were in all,--"
106,II.,All adrift in the lower bay!
107,II.,
108,II.,"Said a hard-faced skipper, ""God help us all!"
109,II.,"She will not float till the turning tide!"""
110,II.,"Said his wife, ""My darling will hear _my_ call,"
111,II.,"Whether in sea or heaven she bide:"""
112,II.,"And she lifted a quavering voice and high,"
113,II.,"Wild and strange as a sea-bird's cry,"
114,II.,Till they shuddered and wondered at her side.
115,II.,
116,II.,"The fog drove down on each laboring crew,"
117,II.,Veiled each from each and the sky and shore:
118,II.,"There was not a sound but the breath they drew,"
119,II.,And the lap of water and creak of oar;
120,II.,"And they felt the breath of the downs, fresh blown"
121,II.,"O'er leagues of clover and cold gray stone,"
122,II.,But not from the lips that had gone before.
123,II.,
124,II.,"They come no more. But they tell the tale,"
125,II.,"That, when fogs are thick on the harbor reef,"
126,II.,The mackerel fishers shorten sail;
127,II.,For the signal they know will bring relief:
128,II.,"For the voices of children, still at play"
129,II.,In a phantom hulk that drifts alway
130,II.,Through channels whose waters never fail.
131,II.,
132,II.,"It is but a foolish shipman's tale,"
133,II.,A theme for a poet's idle page;
134,II.,"But still, when the mists of doubt prevail,"
135,II.,"And we lie becalmed by the shores of Age,"
136,II.,We hear from the misty troubled shore
137,II.,"The voice of the children gone before,"
138,II.,Drawing the soul to its anchorage.
139,II.,
140,II.,
141,II.,
142,II.,
143,II.,A Newport Romance.
144,II.,
145,II.,
146,II.,
147,II.,They say that she died of a broken heart
148,II.,(I tell the tale as 'twas told to me);
149,II.,"But her spirit lives, and her soul is part"
150,II.,Of this sad old house by the sea.
151,II.,
152,II.,Her lover was fickle and fine and French:
153,II.,It was nearly a hundred years ago
154,II.,When he sailed away from her arms--poor wench--
155,II.,With the Admiral Rochambeau.
156,II.,
157,II.,I marvel much what periwigged phrase
158,II.,"Won the heart of this sentimental Quaker,"
159,II.,At what golden-laced speech of those modish days
160,II.,She listened--the mischief take her!
161,II.,
162,II.,But she kept the posies of mignonette
163,II.,That he gave; and ever as their bloom failed
164,II.,And faded (though with her tears still wet)
165,II.,Her youth with their own exhaled.
166,II.,
167,II.,"Till one night, when the sea-fog wrapped a shroud"
168,II.,"Round spar and spire and tarn and tree,"
169,II.,Her soul went up on that lifted cloud
170,II.,From this sad old house by the sea.
171,II.,
172,II.,"And ever since then, when the clock strikes two,"
173,II.,"She walks unbidden from room to room,"
174,II.,And the air is filled that she passes through
175,II.,"With a subtle, sad perfume."
176,II.,
177,II.,"The delicate odor of mignonette,"
178,II.,"The ghost of a dead and gone bouquet,"
179,II.,Is all that tells of her story; yet
180,II.,Could she think of a sweeter way?
181,II.,
182,II.,*       *       *       *       *
183,II.,
184,II.,"I sit in the sad old house to-night,--"
185,II.,Myself a ghost from a farther sea;
186,II.,"And I trust that this Quaker woman might,"
187,II.,"In courtesy, visit me."
188,II.,
189,II.,"For the laugh is fled from porch and lawn,"
190,II.,"And the bugle died from the fort on the hill,"
191,II.,"And the twitter of girls on the stairs is gone,"
192,II.,And the grand piano is still.
193,II.,
194,II.,Somewhere in the darkness a clock strikes two;
195,II.,"And there is no sound in the sad old house,"
196,II.,"But the long veranda dripping with dew,"
197,II.,And in the wainscot a mouse.
198,II.,
199,II.,The light of my study-lamp streams out
200,II.,"From the library door, but has gone astray"
201,II.,In the depths of the darkened hall. Small doubt
202,II.,But the Quakeress knows the way.
203,II.,
204,II.,Was it the trick of a sense o'erwrought
205,II.,With outward watching and inward fret?
206,II.,But I swear that the air just now was fraught
207,II.,With the odor of mignonette!
208,II.,
209,II.,"I open the window, and seem almost--"
210,II.,So still lies the ocean--to hear the beat
211,II.,"Of its Great Gulf artery off the coast,"
212,II.,And to bask in its tropic heat.
213,II.,
214,II.,"In my neighbor's windows the gas-lights flare,"
215,II.,As the dancers swing in a waltz of Strauss;
216,II.,And I wonder now could I fit that air
217,II.,To the song of this sad old house.
218,II.,
219,II.,And no odor of mignonette there is
220,II.,But the breath of morn on the dewy lawn;
221,II.,And mayhap from causes as slight as this
222,II.,The quaint old legend is born.
223,II.,
224,II.,"But the soul of that subtle, sad perfume,"
225,II.,"As the spiced embalmings, they say, outlast"
226,II.,"The mummy laid in his rocky tomb,"
227,II.,Awakens my buried past.
228,II.,
229,II.,"And I think of the passion that shook my youth,"
230,II.,"Of its aimless loves and its idle pains,"
231,II.,And am thankful now for the certain truth
232,II.,That only the sweet remains.
233,II.,
234,II.,"And I hear no rustle of stiff brocade,"
235,II.,And I see no face at my library door;
236,II.,"For now that the ghosts of my heart are laid,"
237,II.,She is viewless forevermore.
238,II.,
239,II.,"But whether she came as a faint perfume,"
240,II.,"Or whether a spirit in stole of white,"
241,II.,"I feel, as I pass from the darkened room,"
242,II.,She has been with my soul to-night!
243,II.,
244,II.,
245,II.,
246,II.,
247,II.,The Hawk's Nest.
248,II.,
249,II.,(Sierras.)
250,II.,
251,II.,
252,II.,
253,II.,"We checked our pace,--the red road sharply rounding;"
254,II.,We heard the troubled flow
255,II.,"Of the dark olive depths of pines, resounding"
256,II.,A thousand feet below.
257,II.,
258,II.,"Above the tumult of the cañon lifted,"
259,II.,The gray hawk breathless hung;
260,II.,Or on the hill a wingèd shadow drifted
261,II.,Where furze and thorn-bush clung;
262,II.,
263,II.,Or where half-way the mountain side was furrowed
264,II.,With many a seam and scar;
265,II.,"Or some abandoned tunnel dimly burrowed,--"
266,II.,A mole-hill seen so far.
267,II.,
268,II.,We looked in silence down across the distant
269,II.,Unfathomable reach:
270,II.,A silence broken by the guide's consistent
271,II.,And realistic speech.
272,II.,
273,II.,"""Walker of Murphy's blew a hole through Peters"
274,II.,For telling him he lied;
275,II.,Then up and dusted out of South Hornitos
276,II.,Across the long Divide.
277,II.,
278,II.,"""We ran him out of Strong's, and up through Eden,"
279,II.,And 'cross the ford below;
280,II.,"And up this cañon (Peters' brother leadin'),"
281,II.,And me and Clark and Joe.
282,II.,
283,II.,"""He fou't us game: somehow, I disremember"
284,II.,Jest how the thing kem round;
285,II.,"Some say 'twas wadding, some a scattered ember"
286,II.,From fires on the ground.
287,II.,
288,II.,"""But in one minute all the hill below him"
289,II.,Was just one sheet of flame;
290,II.,"Guardin' the crest, Sam Clark and I called to him."
291,II.,"And,--well, the dog was game!"
292,II.,
293,II.,"""He made no sign: the fires of hell were round him,"
294,II.,The pit of hell below.
295,II.,"We sat and waited, but never found him;"
296,II.,And then we turned to go.
297,II.,
298,II.,"""And then--you see that rock that's grown so bristly"
299,II.,With chaparral and tan--
300,II.,"Suthin' crep' out: it might hev been a grizzly,"
301,II.,It might hev been a man;
302,II.,
303,II.,"""Suthin' that howled, and gnashed its teeth, and shouted"
304,II.,In smoke and dust and flame;
305,II.,"Suthin' that sprang into the depths about it,"
306,II.,"Grizzly or man,--but game!"
307,II.,
308,II.,"""That's all. Well, yes, it does look rather risky,"
309,II.,And kinder makes one queer
310,II.,And dizzy looking down. A drop of whiskey
311,II.,"Ain't a bad thing right here!"""
312,II.,
313,II.,
314,II.,
315,II.,
316,II.,In the Mission Garden.

324,II.,
325,II.,"I speak not the English well, but Pachita"
326,II.,"She speak for me; is it not so, my Pancha?"
327,II.,"Eh, little rogue? Come, salute me the stranger"
328,II.,Americano.
329,II.,
330,II.,"Sir, in my country we say, ""Where the heart is,"
331,II.,"There live the speech."" Ah! you not understand? So!"
332,II.,"Pardon an old man,--what you call ""ol fogy,""--"
333,II.,Padre Felipe!
334,II.,
335,II.,"Old, Señor, old! just so old as the Mission."
336,II.,"You see that pear-tree? How old you think, Señor?"
337,II.,"Fifteen year? Twenty? Ah, Señor, just _Fifty_"
338,II.,Gone since I plant him!
339,II.,
340,II.,"You like the wine? It is some at the Mission,"
341,II.,Made from the grape of the year Eighteen Hundred;
342,II.,All the same time when the earthquake he come to
343,II.,San Juan Bautista.
344,II.,
345,II.,"But Pancha is twelve, and she is the rose-tree;"
346,II.,"And I am the olive, and this is the garden:"
347,II.,"And Pancha we say; but her name is Francisca,"
348,II.,Same like her mother.
349,II.,
350,II.,"Eh, you knew _her_? No? Ah! it is a story;"
351,II.,"But I speak not, like Pachita, the English:"
352,II.,"So? If I try, you will sit here beside me,"
353,II.,"And shall not laugh, eh?"
354,II.,
355,II.,"When the American come to the Mission,"
356,II.,Many arrive at the house of Francisca:
357,II.,"One,--he was fine man,--he buy the cattle"
358,II.,Of José Castro.
359,II.,
360,II.,"So! he came much, and Francisca she saw him:"
361,II.,"And it was Love,--and a very dry season;"
362,II.,"And the pears bake on the tree,--and the rain come,"
363,II.,But not Francisca;
364,II.,
365,II.,Not for one year; and one night I have walk much
366,II.,"Under the olive-tree, when comes Francisca:"
367,II.,"Comes to me here, with her child, this Francisca,--"
368,II.,Under the olive-tree.
369,II.,
370,II.,"Sir, it was sad; ... but I speak not the English;"
371,II.,"So! ... she stay here, and she wait for her husband"
372,II.,"He come no more, and she sleep on the hillside;"
373,II.,There stands Pachita.
374,II.,
375,II.,Ah! there's the Angelus. Will you not enter?
376,II.,Or shall you walk in the garden with Pancha?

381,II.,

383,II.,
384,II.,

396,II.,
397,II.,
398,II.,
399,II.,"""Well, you see, the fact is, Colonel, I don't know as I can come:"
400,II.,"For the farm is not half planted, and there's work to do at home;"
401,II.,"And my leg is getting troublesome,--it laid me up last fall,"
402,II.,"And the doctors, they have cut and hacked, and never found the ball."
403,II.,
404,II.,"""And then, for an old man like me, it's not exactly right,"
405,II.,This kind o' playing soldier with no enemy in sight.
406,II.,"'The Union,'--that was well enough way up to '66;"
407,II.,"But this 'Re-Union,'--maybe now it's mixed with politics?"
408,II.,
409,II.,"""No? Well, you understand it best; but then, you see, my lad,"
410,II.,"I'm deacon now, and some might think that the example's bad."
411,II.,And week from next is Conference.... You said the 12th of May?
412,II.,"Why, that's the day we broke their line at Spottsylvan-i-a!"
413,II.,
414,II.,"""Hot work; eh, Colonel, wasn't it? Ye mind that narrow front:"
415,II.,"They called it the 'Death-Angle!' Well, well, my lad, we won't"
416,II.,Fight that old battle over now: I only meant to say
417,II.,I really can't engage to come upon the 12th of May.
418,II.,
419,II.,"""How's Thompson? What! will he be there? Well, now, I want to know!"
420,II.,The first man in the rebel works! they called him 'Swearing Joe:'
421,II.,"A wild young fellow, sir, I fear the rascal was; but then--"
422,II.,"Well, short of heaven, there wa'n't a place he dursn't lead his men."
423,II.,
424,II.,"""And Dick, you say, is coming too. And Billy? ah! it's true"
425,II.,We buried him at Gettysburg: I mind the spot; do you?
426,II.,"A little field below the hill,--it must be green this May;"
427,II.,Perhaps that's why the fields about bring him to me to-day.
428,II.,
429,II.,"""Well, well, excuse me, Colonel! but there are some things that drop"
430,II.,The tail-board out one's feelings; and the only way's to stop.
431,II.,"So they want to see the old man; ah, the rascals! do they, eh?"

446,II.,Any complaints to make? Lots of 'em--one of 'em's _you_.
447,II.,
448,II.,"You! who are you, anyhow, goin' round in that sneakin' way?"
449,II.,"Never in jail before, was you, old blatherskite, say?"
450,II.,"Look at it; don't it look pooty? Oh, grin, and be d--d to you, do!"
451,II.,"But, if I had you this side o' that gratin', I'd just make it lively"
452,II.,for you.
453,II.,
454,II.,"How did I get in here? Well, what 'ud you give to know?"
455,II.,'Twasn't by sneakin' round where I hadn't no call to go.
456,II.,'Twasn't by hangin' round a spyin' unfortnet men.

463,II.,
464,II.,"There, I thought that 'ud fetch ye. And you want to know my name?"
465,II.,"""Seventy-Nine"" they call me; but that is their little game."
466,II.,"For I'm werry highly connected, as a gent, sir, can understand;"
467,II.,And my family hold their heads up with the very furst in the land.
468,II.,
469,II.,"For 'twas all, sir, a put-up job on a pore young man like me;"
470,II.,"And the jury was bribed a puppos, and aftdrst they couldn't agree."
471,II.,"And I sed to the judge, sez I,--Oh, grin! it's all right my son!"
472,II.,"But you're a werry lively young pup, and you ain't to be played upon!"
473,II.,
474,II.,Wot's that you got--tobacco? I'm cussed but I thought 'twas a tract.
475,II.,"Thank ye. A chap t'other day--now, look'ee, this is a fact,"
476,II.,"Slings me a tract on the evils o' keepin' bad company,"
477,II.,As if all the saints was howlin' to stay here along's we.
478,II.,
479,II.,"No: I hain't no complaints. Stop, yes; do you see that chap,--"
480,II.,"Him standin' over there,--a hidin' his eves in his cap?"
481,II.,"Well, that man's stumick is weak, and he can't stand the pris'n fare;"
482,II.,"For the coffee is just half beans, and the sugar ain't no where."
483,II.,
484,II.,"Perhaps it's his bringin' up; but he sickens day by day,"
485,II.,"And he doesn't take no food, and I'm seein' him waste away."
486,II.,"And it isn't the thing to see; for, whatever he's been and done,"
487,II.,Starvation isn't the plan as he's to be saved upon.
488,II.,
489,II.,"For he cannot rough it like me; and he hasn't the stamps, I guess,"
490,II.,To buy him his extry grub outside o' the pris'n mess.
491,II.,"And perhaps if a gent like you, with whom I've been sorter free,"
492,II.,"Would--thank you! But, say, look here! Oh, blast it, don't give it to ME!"
493,II.,
494,II.,"Don't you give it to me; now, don't ye, don't ye, don't!"
495,II.,"You think it's a put-up job; so I'll thank ye, sir, if you won't."
496,II.,"But hand him the stamps yourself: why, he isn't even my pal;"

523,II.,(Which the language that invalid uses
524,II.,At times it were vain to relate).
525,II.,
526,II.,And he says that the mountains are fairer

534,II.,

543,II.,
544,II.,"He hopes you are wearing no willows,"

546,II.,That he knows (which this dodging of pillows
547,II.,"Imparts but small ease to the style,"

549,II.,"That, though parted by many a mile,"
550,II.,"Yet were he lying under the snows, Miss,"

552,II.,
553,II.,"And you'll still think of him in your pleasures,"
554,II.,In your brief twilight dreams of the past;
555,II.,"In this green laurel-spray that he treasures,"
556,II.,It was plucked where your parting was last;
557,II.,"In this specimen,--but a small trifle,--"
558,II.,It will do for a pin for your shawl
559,II.,(Which the truth not to wickedly stifle

564,II.,"That I raised his last dose, for a change, Miss,"
565,II.,In view that his fever was high;
566,II.,But he lies there quite peaceful and pensive.
567,II.,"And now, my respects, Miss, to you;"

569,II.,"Might seem to be freedom,--it's true."

749,II.,"There is a limit to human bliss,"
750,II.,And the Mission of San Joaquin had this;
751,II.,"None went abroad to roam or stay,"

754,II.,With gastric symptoms: so they spent

1323,II.,She sailed from Acapulco Bay.
1324,II.,
1325,II.,How did she get there? What strange spell
1326,II.,"Kept her two hundred years so well,"
1327,II.,Free from decay and mortal taint?
1328,II.,What? but the prayers of a patron saint!
1329,II.,"A hundred leagues from Manilla town,"
1330,II.,"The ""San Gregorio's"" helm came down;"
1331,II.,"Round she went on her heel, and not"
1332,II.,A cable's length from a galliot

1357,II.,
1358,II.,"Lost was the day they should have kept,"
1359,II.,Lost unheeded and lost unwept;
1360,II.,"Lost in a way that made search vain,"
1361,II.,Lost in the trackless and boundless main;
1362,II.,"Lost like the day of Job's awful curse,"
1363,II.,"In his third chapter, third and fourth verse;"
1364,II.,"Wrecked was their patron's only day,--"
1365,II.,What would the holy fathers say?
1366,II.,
1367,II.,"Said the Fray Antonio Estavan,"
1368,II.,"The galleon's chaplain,--a learned man,--"
1369,II.,"""Nothing is lost that you can regain:"
1370,II.,And the way to look for a thing is plain
1371,II.,"To go where you lost it, back again."
1372,II.,Back with your galleon till you see
1373,II.,The hundred and eightieth degree.
1374,II.,"Wait till the rolling year goes round,"
1375,II.,And there will the missing day be found;
1376,II.,For you'll find--if computation's true--
1377,II.,That sailing _east_ will give to you
1378,II.,"Not only one ninth of May, but two,--"
1379,II.,"One for the good saint's present cheer,"
1380,II.,"And one for the day we lost last year."""

1386,II.,"But lo! when it came to the ninth of May,"
1387,II.,All of a sudden becalmed she lay
1388,II.,"One degree from that fatal spot,"
1389,II.,Without the power to move a knot;
1390,II.,"And of course the moment she lost her way,"
1391,II.,Gone was her chance to save that day.
1392,II.,
1393,II.,"To cut a lengthening story short,"
1394,II.,She never saved it. Made the sport
1395,II.,"Of evil spirits and baffling wind,"
1396,II.,"She was always before or just behind,"
1397,II.,"One day too soon, or one day too late,"
1398,II.,"And the sun, meanwhile, would never wait:"
1399,II.,"She had two eighths, as she idly lay,"
1400,II.,"Two tenths, but never a _ninth_ of May;"
1401,II.,And there she rides through two hundred years
1402,II.,Of dreary penance and anxious fears:
1403,II.,"Yet through the grace of the saint she served,"
1404,II.,Captain and crew are still preserved.
1405,II.,
1406,II.,"By a computation that still holds good,"
1407,II.,"Made by the Holy Brotherhood,"

1412,II.,"And the folk in Acapulco town,"
1413,II.,"Over the waters, looking down,"
1414,II.,Will see in the glow of the setting sun
1415,II.,"The sails of the missing galleon,"
1416,II.,And the royal standard of Philip _Rey_;
1417,II.,"The gleaming mast and glistening spar,"
1418,II.,As she nears the surf of the outer bar.
1419,II.,"A _Te Deum_ sung on her crowded deck,"
1420,II.,"An odor of spice along the shore,"
1421,II.,"A crash, a cry from a shattered wreck,--"
1422,II.,"And the yearly galleon sails no more,"
1423,II.,In or out of the olden bay;

1439,II.,
1440,II.,
1441,II.,
1442,II.,I read last night of the Grand Review
1443,II.,"In Washington's chiefest avenue,--"
1444,II.,"Two Hundred Thousand men in blue,"
1445,II.,"I think they said was the number,--"
1446,II.,"Till I seemed to hear their trampling feet,"
1447,II.,"The bugle blast and the drum's quick beat,"
1448,II.,"The clatter of hoofs in the stony street,"
1449,II.,"The cheers of people who came to greet,"
1450,II.,And the thousand details that to repeat
1451,II.,"Would only my verse encumber,--"
1452,II.,"Till I fell in a reverie, sad and sweet,"
1453,II.,And then to a fitful slumber.
1454,II.,
1455,II.,"When, lo! in a vision I seemed to stand"
1456,II.,In the lonely Capitol. On each hand
1457,II.,"Far stretched the portico, dim and grand"
1458,II.,Its columns ranged like a martial band
1459,II.,"Of sheeted spectres, whom some command"
1460,II.,Had called to a last reviewing.
1461,II.,And the streets of the city were white and bare;
1462,II.,No footfall echoed across the square;
1463,II.,But out of the misty midnight air
1464,II.,"I heard in the distance a trumpet blare,"
1465,II.,And the wandering night-winds seemed to bear
1466,II.,The sound of a far tattooing.
1467,II.,
1468,II.,Then I held my breath with fear and dread;
1469,II.,"For into the square, with a brazen tread,"
1470,II.,There rode a figure whose stately head
1471,II.,"O'erlooked the review that morning,"
1472,II.,That never bowed from its firm-set seat
1473,II.,"When the living column passed its feet,"
1474,II.,Yet now rode steadily up the street
1475,II.,To the phantom bugle's warning:
1476,II.,
1477,II.,"Till it reached the Capitol square, and wheeled,"
1478,II.,And there in the moonlight stood revealed
1479,II.,A well-known form that in State and field
1480,II.,Had led our patriot sires;
1481,II.,"Whose face was turned to the sleeping camp,"
1482,II.,"Afar through the river's fog and damp,"
1483,II.,"That showed no flicker, nor waning lamp,"
1484,II.,Nor wasted bivouac fires.
1485,II.,
1486,II.,"And I saw a phantom army come,"
1487,II.,"With never a sound of fife or drum,"
1488,II.,But keeping time to a throbbing hum
1489,II.,Of wailing and lamentation:
1490,II.,"The martyred heroes of Malvern Hill,"
1491,II.,"Of Gettysburg and Chancellorsville,"
1492,II.,The men whose wasted figures fill
1493,II.,The patriot graves of the nation.
1494,II.,
1495,II.,"And there came the nameless dead,--the men"
1496,II.,"Who perished in fever swamp and fen,"
1497,II.,The slowly-starved of the prison-pen;
1498,II.,"And, marching beside the others,"
1499,II.,"Came the dusky martyrs of Pillow's fight,"

1505,II.,"With never a banner above them spread,"

1507,II.,No mark--save the bare uncovered head

1509,II.,With never an arch save the vaulted sky;
1510,II.,With never a flower save those that lie
1511,II.,On the distant graves--for love could buy
1512,II.,No gift that was purer or truer.
1513,II.,
1514,II.,"So all night long swept the strange array,"

1516,II.,"I watched for one who had passed away,"

1518,II.,"Till a blue cap waved in the lengthening line,"

1563,II.,"It was the stage-driver's story, as he stood with his back to the wheelers,"
1564,II.,"Quietly flecking his whip, and turning his quid of tobacco;"
1565,II.,"While on the dusty road, and blent with the rays of the moonlight,"
1566,II.,We saw the long curl of his lash and the juice of tobacco descending.
1567,II.,
1568,II.,"""Danger! Sir, I believe you,--indeed, I may say on that subject,"
1569,II.,You your existence might put to the hazard and turn of a wager.
1570,II.,"I have seen danger? Oh, no! not me, sir, indeed, I assure you:"
1571,II.,'Twas only the man with the dog that is sitting alone in yon wagon.
1572,II.,
1573,II.,"It was the Geiger Grade, a mile and a half from the summit:"
1574,II.,"Black as your hat was the night, and never a star in the heavens."
1575,II.,"Thundering down the grade, the gravel and stones we sent flying"
1576,II.,"Over the precipice side,--a thousand feet plumb to the bottom."
1577,II.,
1578,II.,"Half-way down the grade I felt, sir, a thrilling and creaking,"
1579,II.,"Then a lurch to one side, as we hung on the bank of the cañon;"
1580,II.,"Then, looking up the road, I saw, in the distance behind me,"
1581,II.,"The off hind wheel of the coach just loosed from its axle, and following."
1582,II.,
1583,II.,"One glance alone I gave, then gathered together my ribbons,"
1584,II.,"Shouted, and flung them, outspread, on the straining necks of my cattle;"
1585,II.,"Screamed at the top of my voice, and lashed the air in my frenzy,"
1586,II.,"While down the Geiger Grade, on _three_ wheels, the vehicle thundered."
1587,II.,
1588,II.,"Speed was our only chance, when again came the ominous rattle:"
1589,II.,"Crack, and another wheel slipped away, and was lost in the darkness."
1590,II.,"_Two_ only now were left; yet such was our fearful momentum,"
1591,II.,"Upright, erect, and sustained on _two_ wheels, the vehicle thundered."
1592,II.,
1593,II.,"As some huge boulder, unloosed from its rocky shelf on the mountain,"
1594,II.,"Drives before it the hare and the timorous squirrel, far-leaping,"
1595,II.,"So down the Geiger Grade rushed the Pioneer coach, and before it"
1596,II.,"Leaped the wild horses, and shrieked in advance of the danger impending."
1597,II.,
1598,II.,"But to be brief in my tale. Again, ere we came to the level,"
1599,II.,"Slipped from its axle a wheel; so that, to be plain in my statement,"
1600,II.,"A matter of twelve hundred yards or more, as the distance may be,"
1601,II.,"We travelled upon _one_ wheel, until we drove up to the station."
1602,II.,
1603,II.,"Then, sir, we sank in a heap; but, picking myself from the ruins,"
1604,II.,"I heard a noise up the grade; and looking, I saw in the distance"
1605,II.,"The three wheels following still, like moons on the horizon whirling,"
1606,II.,"Till, circling, they gracefully sank on the road at the side of the"
1607,II.,station.
1608,II.,
1609,II.,"This is my story, sir; a trifle, indeed, I assure you."
1610,II.,"Much more, perchance, might be said; but I hold him, of all men, most"
1611,II.,lightly
1612,II.,"Who swerves from the truth in his tale--No, thank you--Well, since you"

1645,II.,"I might here remark that 'twas doubted by many,"

1647,II.,"But no one could look in that eloquent face,"
1648,II.,"With its exquisite outline, and features of grace,"
1649,II.,"And mark, through the transparent skin, how the tide"
1650,II.,"Ebbed and flowed at the impulse of passion or pride,--"
1651,II.,"None could look, who believed in the blood's circulation"
1652,II.,"As argued by Harvey, but saw confirmation,"

1657,II.,"Preferred of all others to carry her fan,"
1658,II.,"Hook her glove, drape her shawl, and do all that a belle"
1659,II.,May demand of the lover she wants to treat well.

1661,II.,"Abstracted and solemn, in manner a clown,"

1663,II.,Should appear as her escort at party or hop.

1673,II.,
1674,II.,For a fortnight the townfolk had all been agog
1675,II.,"With a party, the finest the season had seen,"
1676,II.,"To be given in honor of Miss Pollywog,"
1677,II.,Who was just coming out as a belle of sixteen.
1678,II.,"The guests were invited: but one night before,"
1679,II.,A carriage drew up at the modest back-door
1680,II.,"Of Brown's lab'ratory; and, full in the glare"
1681,II.,"Of a big purple bottle, some closely-veiled fair"
1682,II.,"Alighted and entered: to make matters plain,"
1683,II.,"Spite of veils and disguises,--'twas Addie De Laine."
1684,II.,
1685,II.,"As a bower for true love, 'twas hardly the one"
1686,II.,That a lady would choose to be wooed in or won:
1687,II.,No odor of rose or sweet jessamine's sigh
1688,II.,"Breathed a fragrance to hallow their pledge of troth by,"
1689,II.,Nor the balm that exhales from the odorous thyme;
1690,II.,"But the gaseous effusions of chloride of lime,"
1691,II.,"And salts, which your chemist delights to explain"
1692,II.,As the base of the smell of the rose and the drain.
1693,II.,"Think of this, O ye lovers of sweetness! and know"
1694,II.,"What you smell, when you snuff up Lubin or Pinaud."
1695,II.,
1696,II.,"I pass by the greetings, the transports and bliss,"
1697,II.,"Which, of course, duly followed a meeting like this,"
1698,II.,And come down to business;--for such the intent
1699,II.,"Of the lady who now o'er the crucible leant,"
1700,II.,"In the glow of a furnace of carbon and lime,"
1701,II.,Like a fairy called up in the new pantomime;--
1702,II.,"And give but her words as she coyly looked down,"
1703,II.,In reply to the questioning glances of Brown:
1704,II.,"""I am taking the drops, and am using the paste,"
1705,II.,"And the little, white powders that had a sweet taste,"
1706,II.,"Which you told me would brighten the glance of my eye,"
1707,II.,"And the depilatory, and also the dye,"
1708,II.,"And I'm charmed with the trial; and now, my dear Brown,"
1709,II.,"I have one other favor,--now, ducky, don't frown,--"
1710,II.,"Only one, for a chemist and genius like you"
1711,II.,"But a trifle, and one you can easily do."
1712,II.,"Now listen: tomorrow, you know, is the night"
1713,II.,Of the birthday _soiree_ of that Pollywog fright;
1714,II.,"And I'm to be there, and the dress I shall wear"
1715,II.,"Is _too_ lovely; but""--""But what then, _ma chere_?"""
1716,II.,"Said Brown, as the lady came to a full stop,"
1717,II.,And glanced round the shelves of the little back shop.
1718,II.,"""Well, I want--I want something to fill out the skirt"
1719,II.,"To the proper dimension, without being girt"
1720,II.,"In a stiff crinoline, or caged in a hoop"
1721,II.,That shows through one's skirt like the bars of a coop;
1722,II.,"Something light, that a lady may waltz in, or polk,"
1723,II.,With a freedom that none but you masculine folk
1724,II.,"Ever know. For, however poor woman aspires,"
1725,II.,She's always bound down to the earth by these wires.
1726,II.,"Are you listening? nonsense! don't stare like a spoon,"
1727,II.,"Idiotic; some light thing, and spacious, and soon--"
1728,II.,"Something like--well, in fact--something like a balloon!"""
1729,II.,"Here she paused; and here Brown, overcome by surprise,"
1730,II.,"Gave a doubting assent with still wondering eyes,"
1731,II.,And the lady departed. But just at the door
1732,II.,"Something happened,--'tis true, it had happened before"
1733,II.,"In this sanctum of science,--a sibilant sound,"
1734,II.,"Like some element just from its trammels unbound,"
1735,II.,Or two substances that their affinities found.
1736,II.,
1737,II.,The night of the anxiously looked-for _soirée_
1738,II.,"Had come, with its fair ones in gorgeous array;"
1739,II.,"With the rattle of wheels, and the tinkle of bells,"
1740,II.,"And the ""How do ye dos,"" and the ""Hope you are wells;"""
1741,II.,"And the crash in the passage, and last lingering look"
1742,II.,You give as you hang your best hat on the hook;
1743,II.,The rush of hot air as the door opens wide;
1744,II.,"And your entry,--that blending of self-possessed pride"
1745,II.,And humility shown in your perfect-bred stare
1746,II.,"At the folk, as if wondering how they got there;"
1747,II.,With other tricks worthy of Vanity Fair.
1748,II.,"Meanwhile that safe topic, the heat of the room,"
1749,II.,Already was losing its freshness and bloom;
1750,II.,"Young people were yawning, and wondering when"
1751,II.,"The dance would come off, and why didn't it then:"
1752,II.,"When a vague expectation was thrilling the crowd,"
1753,II.,"Lo, the door swung its hinges with utterance proud!"
1754,II.,"And Pompey announced, with a trumpet-like strain,"
1755,II.,The entrance of Brown and Miss Addie De Laine.
1756,II.,
1757,II.,"She entered: but oh, how imperfect the verb"
1758,II.,To express to the senses her movement superb!
1759,II.,"To say that she ""sailed in"" more clearly might tell"
1760,II.,Her grace in its buoyant and billowy swell.
1761,II.,"Her robe was a vague circumambient space,"
1762,II.,With shadowy boundaries made of point-lace.
1763,II.,"The rest was but guess-work, and well might defy"
1764,II.,The power of critical feminine eye
1765,II.,To define or describe: 'twere as futile to try
1766,II.,"The gossamer web of the cirrus to trace,"
1767,II.,Floating far in the blue of a warm summer sky.
1768,II.,
1769,II.,"'Midst the humming of praises and the glances of beaux,"
1770,II.,"That greet our fair maiden wherever she goes,"
1771,II.,"Brown slipped like a shadow, grim, silent, and black,"
1772,II.,"With a look of anxiety, close in her track."
1773,II.,"Once he whispered aside in her delicate ear,"
1774,II.,"A sentence of warning,--it might be of fear:"
1775,II.,"""Don't stand in a draught, if you value your life."""
1776,II.,"(Nothing more,--such advice might be given your wife"
1777,II.,"Or your sweetheart, in times of bronchitis and cough,"
1778,II.,"Without mystery, romance, or frivolous scoff.)"
1779,II.,But hark to the music: the dance has begun.
1780,II.,The closely-draped windows wide open are flung;
1781,II.,"The notes of the piccolo, joyous and light,"
1782,II.,Like bubbles burst forth on the warm summer night.
1783,II.,Round about go the dancers; in circles they fly;
1784,II.,"Trip, trip, go their feet as their skirts eddy by;"
1785,II.,"And swifter and lighter, but somewhat too plain,"
1786,II.,Whisks the fair circumvolving Miss Addie De Laine.
1787,II.,
1788,II.,Taglioni and Cerito well might have pined
1789,II.,For the vigor and ease that her movements combined;
1790,II.,E'en Rigelboche never flung higher her robe
1791,II.,In the naughtiest city that's known on the globe.
1792,II.,"'Twas amazing, 'twas scandalous: lost in surprise,"
1793,II.,"Some opened their mouths, and a few shut their eyes."
1794,II.,
1795,II.,"But hark! At the moment Miss Addie De Laine,"
1796,II.,"Circling round at the outer edge of an ellipse,"
1797,II.,"Which brought her fair form to the window again,"
1798,II.,From the arms of her partner incautiously slips!
1799,II.,"And a shriek fills the air, and the music is still,"
1800,II.,And the crowd gather round where her partner forlorn
1801,II.,Still frenziedly points from the wide window-sill
1802,II.,Into space and the night; for Miss Addie was gone!
1803,II.,
1804,II.,Gone like the bubble that bursts in the sun;
1805,II.,Gone like the grain when the reaper is done;
1806,II.,Gone like the dew on the fresh morning grass;
1807,II.,Gone without parting farewell; and alas!

1950,II.,
1951,II.,"There, in spite of rain that balked,"
1952,II.,"With his sandals duly chalked,"
1953,II.,Once upon a tight-rope walked
1954,II.,Mr. Cooke.
1955,II.,
1956,II.,"But the jester's lightsome mien,"
1957,II.,"And his spangles and his sheen,"
1958,II.,"All had vanished, when the scene"

1960,II.,
1961,II.,"Yet in some delusive hope,"
1962,II.,"In some vague desire to cope,"
1963,II.,One still came to view the rope

1976,II.,"Then she turned, and quickly cried"

1995,II.,
1996,II.,"""Clifford Snook, I know thy claim"

2006,II.,Though to that gymnastic feat
2007,II.,He no closer might compete

2009,II.,In a book;
2010,II.,
2011,II.,"Yet thenceforward, from that day,"
2012,II.,He his figure would display
2013,II.,"In some wild athletic way,"
2014,II.,After Cooke.

2025,II.,
2026,II.,"Step by step did he proceed,"
2027,II.,"Nerved by valor, not by greed,"

2030,II.,
2031,II.,"Misty was the midnight air,"
2032,II.,"And the cliff was bleak and bare,"
2033,II.,When he came to do and dare
2034,II.,Just like Cooke.
2035,II.,
2036,II.,"Through the darkness, o'er the flow,"
2037,II.,Stretched the line where he should go
2038,II.,"Straight across, as flies the crow"
2039,II.,Or the rook:
2040,II.,
2041,II.,One wild glance around he cast;
2042,II.,"Then he faced the ocean blast,"
2043,II.,And he strode the cable last
2044,II.,Touched by Cooke.
2045,II.,
2046,II.,Vainly roared the angry seas;
2047,II.,Vainly blew the ocean breeze;
2048,II.,"But, alas! the walker's knees"
2049,II.,Had a crook;
2050,II.,
2051,II.,And before he reached the rock
2052,II.,"Did they both together knock,"
2053,II.,And he stumbled with a shock--
2054,II.,Unlike Cooke!
2055,II.,
2056,II.,"Downward dropping in the dark,"
2057,II.,"Like an arrow to its mark,"
2058,II.,Or a fish-pole when a shark
2059,II.,"Bites the hook,"

2061,II.,"Dropped the pole he could not save,"
2062,II.,"Dropped the walker, and the wave"
2063,II.,Swift ingulfed the rival brave
2064,II.,Of J. Cooke!
2065,II.,
2066,II.,Came a roar across the sea
2067,II.,"Of sea-lions in their glee,"
2068,II.,In a tongue remarkably
2069,II.,Like Chinnook;
2070,II.,
2071,II.,And the maddened sea-gull seemed
2072,II.,"Still to utter, as he screamed,"
2073,II.,"""Perish thus the wretch who deemed"

2075,II.,
2076,II.,"But, on misty moonlit nights,"

2081,II.,"And unseen to mortal eyes,"
2082,II.,"Purged of grosser earthly ties,"

2208,II.,How that which in Maud was native grace
2209,II.,In Mrs. Jenkins was out of place;
