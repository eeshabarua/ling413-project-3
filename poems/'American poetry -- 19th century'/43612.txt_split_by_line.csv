55,DEAR KATYDID:,DEAR KATYDID:
56,DEAR KATYDID:,
57,DEAR KATYDID:,I am more pleased with your lines than when I first read them; they
58,DEAR KATYDID:,"are intensely womanly, natural, musical and sweet--they are absolutely"
59,DEAR KATYDID:,"free from affectation, only the restraint of rhyme and measure seem to"
60,DEAR KATYDID:,deprive your muse of perfect freedom and grace. There is also a
61,DEAR KATYDID:,"delicacy of thought and fancy, and of purity of sentiment that"
62,DEAR KATYDID:,pervades the whole like the sweetest perfume.
63,DEAR KATYDID:,
64,DEAR KATYDID:,"No one can listen to your ""Chirpings"" and feel like touching the bough"
65,DEAR KATYDID:,"from which you sing with a rude, critical hand; he would rather listen"
66,DEAR KATYDID:,through the live-long night to the end of your song.
67,DEAR KATYDID:,
68,DEAR KATYDID:,I remember well your first attempt at rhyme while a girl here at
69,DEAR KATYDID:,"school; even then, there was a pleasing promise of a beautiful and"
70,DEAR KATYDID:,useful pen; and I am glad that you have found time and opportunity to
71,DEAR KATYDID:,"improve your early gift. I am glad, too, that you have been persuaded"
72,DEAR KATYDID:,"to give some of your sweet little poems to the press; the tender, the"
73,DEAR KATYDID:,"true, and the pure of heart will read them with delight."
74,DEAR KATYDID:,
75,DEAR KATYDID:,"Affectionately your friend,"

187,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Do you know your plaintive calling,"
188,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"When the summer dew is falling,"
189,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Echoes sweeter through my brain
190,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Than any soft, harmonic strain?"
191,KATYDID'S POEMS.,
192,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Others call you an intruder,"
193,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Say discordant notes you know;
194,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Or that sadness,"
195,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"More than gladness,"
196,KATYDID'S POEMS.,From your little heart doth flow;
197,KATYDID'S POEMS.,And that you awake from sleeping
198,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Thoughts in quiet they were keeping,"
199,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Faithless love, or ill-laid schemes,"
200,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Hopes unanchored--broken dreams.
201,KATYDID'S POEMS.,
202,KATYDID'S POEMS.,No such phantoms to my vision
203,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Doth your lullaby impart,"
204,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"But sweet faces,"
205,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"No tear traces,"
206,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Smile as joyous in my heart,"
207,KATYDID'S POEMS.,As when first at mother's knee
208,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Learned I your sweet mystery.
209,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"I defend you with my praises,"
210,KATYDID'S POEMS.,For your song my soul upraises.
211,KATYDID'S POEMS.,
212,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Do you wonder that at twilight
213,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Always by my cottage door
214,KATYDID'S POEMS.,I am seated?
215,KATYDID'S POEMS.,You've repeated
216,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Oft'ner still those tunes of yore;
217,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"And I love them, love your scanning"
218,KATYDID'S POEMS.,And your noisy tree-top planning;
219,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Though you struggle with a rhyme,"

222,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Oft I fancy when your neighbors,"

226,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"What that little maiden did,"
227,KATYDID'S POEMS.,That above their clam'rous singing
228,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"I can hear your accents ringing,"
229,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Like a voice that must defend
230,KATYDID'S POEMS.,From abuse some time-loved friend.
231,KATYDID'S POEMS.,
232,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Though the nightingale and swallow
233,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Through the poet's measures sing,"
234,KATYDID'S POEMS.,No reflection
235,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Of dejection
236,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Petrifies or palls your wing.
237,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"In the calm and holy moonlight,"
238,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"On and on with hours of midnight,"
239,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"In the darkness, in the rain,"
240,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Still you whisper your refrain.
241,KATYDID'S POEMS.,
242,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Dream I not of fame or fortune,"
243,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Only this I inward crave,"
244,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Sweet assurance,"
245,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Long endurance,"
246,KATYDID'S POEMS.,Of a love beyond the grave.
247,KATYDID'S POEMS.,"Should my songs die out and perish,"
248,KATYDID'S POEMS.,You'll my name repeat and cherish;

257,KATYDID.,A Day-Dream.
258,KATYDID.,
259,KATYDID.,
260,KATYDID.,"I'm looking in a mirror, Belle,"
261,KATYDID.,The mirror of our past;
262,KATYDID.,"And many a bright reflection, Belle,"
263,KATYDID.,Into its depth is cast;
264,KATYDID.,"Reflections that are calm and clear,"
265,KATYDID.,And O! to us so very dear.
266,KATYDID.,
267,KATYDID.,I see a village--old Kirksville--
268,KATYDID.,"Its long and narrow street,"
269,KATYDID.,"And as it climbs upon the hill,"
270,KATYDID.,How many friends I meet!
271,KATYDID.,"And, Belle, your face smiles out to me--"
272,KATYDID.,The sweetest face that I can see.
273,KATYDID.,
274,KATYDID.,There is my home hid 'mong the trees
275,KATYDID.,"Back of the village street,"
276,KATYDID.,"A welcome rushes on the breeze,"
277,KATYDID.,And restless grow my feet;
278,KATYDID.,"My heart leaps forward, and I view"
279,KATYDID.,The dearest spot I ever knew.
280,KATYDID.,
281,KATYDID.,"Home! home again! and, children, we"
282,KATYDID.,Skip through the pastures green;
283,KATYDID.,Your eyes of blue I plainly see--
284,KATYDID.,"""The sweetest ever seen;"""
285,KATYDID.,And on your cheek the rosy tinge;
286,KATYDID.,And curls of gold your temples fringe.
287,KATYDID.,
288,KATYDID.,And see the dogs we used to pet;
289,KATYDID.,Down through the lawn they run;
290,KATYDID.,"Not many passing by, forget"
291,KATYDID.,"Their bark, or fail to shun"
292,KATYDID.,"Old Carlo of the greyhound race,"
293,KATYDID.,And Lion with his vicious face.
294,KATYDID.,
295,KATYDID.,"Yet us they follow to the hedge,"
296,KATYDID.,Where hours with them we've played;
297,KATYDID.,"And to the pond, along whose edge,"
298,KATYDID.,"Barefooted, we would wade."
299,KATYDID.,"Decorum could not cramp the brain,"
300,KATYDID.,And Love unlocked his golden chain.
301,KATYDID.,
302,KATYDID.,"We climb upon my father's barn,"
303,KATYDID.,Hide in the straw and hay;
304,KATYDID.,"We watch aunt ""Silvy"" spinning yarn"
305,KATYDID.,In the old-fashioned way.
306,KATYDID.,"She tells us tales by candle light,"
307,KATYDID.,That fill our hearts with wild delight.
308,KATYDID.,
309,KATYDID.,A shadow falls; I lose your face;
310,KATYDID.,Lost is the fairy-tale;
311,KATYDID.,And just before my eyes I trace
312,KATYDID.,A kind of airy veil;
313,KATYDID.,"A network that is strangely planned,"
314,KATYDID.,Held by the Present's cunning hand.
315,KATYDID.,
316,KATYDID.,The shadow now has passed away;
317,KATYDID.,"I glance the meshes through,"
318,KATYDID.,And find strange children there at play
319,KATYDID.,"Beside your knee; one, two--"
320,KATYDID.,The little faces both foretell
321,KATYDID.,"A happy future for you, Belle."
322,KATYDID.,
323,KATYDID.,"Long, long I gaze. That pretty view"
324,KATYDID.,"Dissolves away in air,"
325,KATYDID.,"And still I'm looking, Belle, for you,"
326,KATYDID.,And still I'm standing there;
327,KATYDID.,I strive your image to retrace--
328,KATYDID.,"All, all has vanished but my face."
329,KATYDID.,
330,KATYDID.,"And closing 'round me as before,"
331,KATYDID.,"I see a figured wall,"
332,KATYDID.,"A carpet blue upon the floor,"
333,KATYDID.,And sunlight over all.
334,KATYDID.,"Bewildered, yet entranced I seem,"
335,KATYDID.,And 'waken from a sweet day-dream.
336,KATYDID.,
337,KATYDID.,
338,KATYDID.,
339,KATYDID.,
340,KATYDID.,The Old Ravine.
341,KATYDID.,
342,KATYDID.,
343,KATYDID.,"Just back of my dear old home it rolled,"
344,KATYDID.,"With many a crumpled and rocky fold,"
345,KATYDID.,Hedged 'round with cherry and locust trees
346,KATYDID.,Their strong arms toyed with the breeze--
347,KATYDID.,Like knights arrayed for march or fight
348,KATYDID.,They stood with waving plumes of white.
349,KATYDID.,
350,KATYDID.,And O! that valley's inmost room
351,KATYDID.,Was a mass of ivy and violet bloom;
352,KATYDID.,The larkspur shook from its purple crest
353,KATYDID.,A dew-drop down on the lily's breast;
354,KATYDID.,"The blue-bell dozed on the rivulet's brink,"
355,KATYDID.,And the myrtle leaned o'er the edge to drink.
356,KATYDID.,
357,KATYDID.,"Even now, as I write, through the open door"
358,KATYDID.,"I catch a sound of the cataract's roar,"
359,KATYDID.,And see the girls just out from school
360,KATYDID.,Knee-deep in the ravine's limpid pool;
361,KATYDID.,"And the boys, ah, me! how plain can I see"
362,KATYDID.,Them stealing the bark from the slippery tree.
363,KATYDID.,
364,KATYDID.,"The door slams back, it is scarce apart;"
365,KATYDID.,"With steady eye and fluttering heart,"
366,KATYDID.,"I watch the girls up the valley turn,"
367,KATYDID.,In search of peppermint and fern;
368,KATYDID.,"And the boys are waving their caps to me,"
369,KATYDID.,As they stand in that ragged and torn old tree.
370,KATYDID.,
371,KATYDID.,"In some wild way, I never knew how,"
372,KATYDID.,I climbed to the swing on that elm tree's bough;
373,KATYDID.,"Was twitt'ring a song as I used to do,"
374,KATYDID.,"And counting the clouds in the sky's soft blue,"
375,KATYDID.,"When the girls came out from the valley's shade,"
376,KATYDID.,And earth into heaven seemed then to fade.
377,KATYDID.,
378,KATYDID.,"'Twas the Eden of old, and I was a child"
379,KATYDID.,(I have thought of it since and often have smiled);
380,KATYDID.,"Sitting there in the swing, with the girls at my feet,"
381,KATYDID.,And the boys overhead--my joy was complete;
382,KATYDID.,"What a mockery, then, to awaken and part"
383,KATYDID.,With the happy illusion--how hollow my heart!
384,KATYDID.,
385,KATYDID.,
386,KATYDID.,
387,KATYDID.,
388,KATYDID.,Some Day You'll Wish for Me.

397,FOR ---- ----,You'll wish for me.
398,FOR ---- ----,
399,FOR ---- ----,"Some day, my darling, when the crystal cup"
400,FOR ---- ----,"Of Beauty shattered lies, and spilled its wine;"

403,FOR ---- ----,You'll wish for me.

405,FOR ---- ----,Some day the wreath will wilt upon your head;

416,FOR ---- ----,
417,FOR ---- ----,You'll long for him whose hands were oft denied
418,FOR ---- ----,To pluck a rose lest they the bush pollute--
419,FOR ---- ----,Yet he would come and stand a slave aside.
420,FOR ---- ----,"To grasp the bramble and the thorn uproot,"
421,FOR ---- ----,If you but wished for him.
422,FOR ---- ----,
423,FOR ---- ----,"He'd kiss your limbs the hidden briar had torn,"

427,FOR ---- ----,He'd kneel and pray

430,FOR ---- ----,For strength to turn aside and leave you there
431,FOR ---- ----,Clasped in the arms of everlasting night;

441,WRITTEN FOR ----,
442,WRITTEN FOR ----,
443,WRITTEN FOR ----,Sad and cheerless stands the homestead
444,WRITTEN FOR ----,In its grandeur as of old;
445,WRITTEN FOR ----,"'Tis a casket--lost, the jewel;"
446,WRITTEN FOR ----,'Tis a mine without its gold.
447,WRITTEN FOR ----,
448,WRITTEN FOR ----,Once a sunbeam at the doorway
449,WRITTEN FOR ----,Gilded room and gladdened hall;
450,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Making life a golden summer,"
451,WRITTEN FOR ----,Full of joy for each and all.
452,WRITTEN FOR ----,
453,WRITTEN FOR ----,But the sunshine that has vanished
454,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Ne'er can brighten o'er us more,"
455,WRITTEN FOR ----,Though I bow in meek submission
456,WRITTEN FOR ----,Yet my heart is sad and sore.
457,WRITTEN FOR ----,
458,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I have lost my life's sweet treasure,"
459,WRITTEN FOR ----,Earth holds nothing dear for me;

477,WRITTEN FOR ----,
478,WRITTEN FOR ----,
479,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I've asked you to forget me,"
480,WRITTEN FOR ----,To let our happy past
481,WRITTEN FOR ----,Ne'er be recalled; for ah! it was
482,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Too sweet, too bright! to last."
483,WRITTEN FOR ----,
484,WRITTEN FOR ----,"But yet you say that you're my friend,"
485,WRITTEN FOR ----,And still as fond and true;

487,WRITTEN FOR ----,Or have one thought of you.
488,WRITTEN FOR ----,
489,WRITTEN FOR ----,Then ne'er again recall those days

504,WRITTEN FOR ----,
505,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Gather up the broken playthings,"

509,WRITTEN FOR ----,
510,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Hide away the dolls, the dishes--"
511,WRITTEN FOR ----,Precious treasures! O! so dear!
512,WRITTEN FOR ----,Lay aside the little dresses--
513,WRITTEN FOR ----,In each fold a mother's tear.
514,WRITTEN FOR ----,
515,WRITTEN FOR ----,"God hath given--God hath taken,"
516,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Though it rends the heart in twain,"
517,WRITTEN FOR ----,"He but sends his frowns upon us,"
518,WRITTEN FOR ----,To give back his smiles again.
519,WRITTEN FOR ----,
520,WRITTEN FOR ----,"She hath gone to 'wait your coming,"
521,WRITTEN FOR ----,Smiling where the angels stand;
522,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Lingering there at heaven's gateway,"
523,WRITTEN FOR ----,That she first may clasp your hand.
524,WRITTEN FOR ----,
525,WRITTEN FOR ----,
526,WRITTEN FOR ----,
527,WRITTEN FOR ----,
528,WRITTEN FOR ----,The Little Front Gate.
529,WRITTEN FOR ----,
530,WRITTEN FOR ----,
531,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Away from the world and its bustle,"
532,WRITTEN FOR ----,When the daylight grows pleasant and late;
533,WRITTEN FOR ----,"In our own cosy cot, I am waiting"
534,WRITTEN FOR ----,For the slam of the little front gate.
535,WRITTEN FOR ----,
536,WRITTEN FOR ----,"The birds at the doorway are singing,"
537,WRITTEN FOR ----,The roses their beauty debate;
538,WRITTEN FOR ----,"But I sit here alone, and I listen"
539,WRITTEN FOR ----,For the slam of the little front gate.
540,WRITTEN FOR ----,
541,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Sometimes, ere the shadows of twilight"
542,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Send the roving bird home to its mate,"
543,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I list for a hurrying footstep,"
544,WRITTEN FOR ----,And the slam of the little front gate.
545,WRITTEN FOR ----,
546,WRITTEN FOR ----,"O! you who are burdened with sorrow,"
547,WRITTEN FOR ----,"And believe that life is but fate,"
548,WRITTEN FOR ----,Learn from me there is joy in waiting
549,WRITTEN FOR ----,For the slam of the little front gate.
550,WRITTEN FOR ----,
551,WRITTEN FOR ----,
552,WRITTEN FOR ----,
553,WRITTEN FOR ----,
554,WRITTEN FOR ----,Drifting.
555,WRITTEN FOR ----,
556,WRITTEN FOR ----,
557,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Scotta, you are drifting from me,"
558,WRITTEN FOR ----,O'er the billows of life's tide;
559,WRITTEN FOR ----,"You and I have sailed together,"
560,WRITTEN FOR ----,With our frail barks side by side.
561,WRITTEN FOR ----,
562,WRITTEN FOR ----,"You are drifting with the current,"
563,WRITTEN FOR ----,"But my feeble oar is light,"
564,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Too light to follow; and, in anguish,"
565,WRITTEN FOR ----,I must watch you drift from sight.
566,WRITTEN FOR ----,
567,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Drifting, gliding, moving onward,"
568,WRITTEN FOR ----,Tide and sky seem one deep blue;
569,WRITTEN FOR ----,"All in vain my eyes are yearning,"
570,WRITTEN FOR ----,You have drifted from my view.
571,WRITTEN FOR ----,
572,WRITTEN FOR ----,"But there's yet a broader current,"
573,WRITTEN FOR ----,Where our meeting barks will land;
574,WRITTEN FOR ----,"You and I still bound together,"
575,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Heart to heart, and hand to hand."
576,WRITTEN FOR ----,
577,WRITTEN FOR ----,
578,WRITTEN FOR ----,
579,WRITTEN FOR ----,
580,WRITTEN FOR ----,Looking Back.
581,WRITTEN FOR ----,
582,WRITTEN FOR ----,
583,WRITTEN FOR ----,"She opened a little worn package,"
584,WRITTEN FOR ----,Scarred yellow by Time's ruthless hand;
585,WRITTEN FOR ----,Disclosing a bundle of letters
586,WRITTEN FOR ----,Tied up with a pale ribbon band.
587,WRITTEN FOR ----,
588,WRITTEN FOR ----,"""These,"" she said, ""are like leaves from a fernery,"
589,WRITTEN FOR ----,Long pressed in a book with a flower;
590,WRITTEN FOR ----,"And the memories wafted up from them,"
591,WRITTEN FOR ----,Like perfume that follows a shower.
592,WRITTEN FOR ----,
593,WRITTEN FOR ----,"""With no wormwood or gall in the essence,"
594,WRITTEN FOR ----,Few tares in life's garden were sown;
595,WRITTEN FOR ----,"The clouds partly hiding the sunshine,"
596,WRITTEN FOR ----,Some weeds with the blossoms have grown.
597,WRITTEN FOR ----,
598,WRITTEN FOR ----,"""But we loved""--here she held out a picture;"
599,WRITTEN FOR ----,"A tear-drop was dimming her eye,"
600,WRITTEN FOR ----,"As a cloud will o'ershadow the landscape,"
601,WRITTEN FOR ----,Or shut out a star in the sky.
602,WRITTEN FOR ----,
603,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I took up a ring and a locket,"
604,WRITTEN FOR ----,Set deep with a ruby and pearl;
605,WRITTEN FOR ----,"The clasp was all tarnished and broken,"
606,WRITTEN FOR ----,"And tear-stained the face of the girl,"
607,WRITTEN FOR ----,
608,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Whose eyes were awake in Hope's morning,"
609,WRITTEN FOR ----,Love kindled their depths with his spark--
610,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Even then, from the red velvet lining,"
611,WRITTEN FOR ----,They glowed like a gem in the dark.
612,WRITTEN FOR ----,
613,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I turned to the sad little figure,"
614,WRITTEN FOR ----,'Round the package the faded cord tied;
615,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Pressed my lips to her cheek--ah, how sadly"
616,WRITTEN FOR ----,The roses had bloomed there and died.
617,WRITTEN FOR ----,
618,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Long we sat in the lingering twilight,"
619,WRITTEN FOR ----,Looking back o'er the vanishing years;
620,WRITTEN FOR ----,"She sobbed out her grief on my bosom,"
621,WRITTEN FOR ----,And moistened my brow with her tears.
622,WRITTEN FOR ----,
623,WRITTEN FOR ----,What comfort in words could I offer?
624,WRITTEN FOR ----,There was more in a soul-telling glance;
625,WRITTEN FOR ----,"For each heart hath its season of springtime,"
626,WRITTEN FOR ----,Each heart hath a buried romance.
627,WRITTEN FOR ----,
628,WRITTEN FOR ----,
629,WRITTEN FOR ----,
630,WRITTEN FOR ----,
631,WRITTEN FOR ----,Scotta.
632,WRITTEN FOR ----,
633,WRITTEN FOR ----,
634,WRITTEN FOR ----,I Saw her last night in a vision
635,WRITTEN FOR ----,(How often she comes when I dream!)
636,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Through the garden of Heaven she loitered,"
637,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Then stood by a clear, placid stream."
638,WRITTEN FOR ----,
639,WRITTEN FOR ----,And out of the heart of the river
640,WRITTEN FOR ----,"A bunch of white lilies she drew,"
641,WRITTEN FOR ----,I scarce could discern from the blossoms
642,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Her fingers, so waxen their hue."
643,WRITTEN FOR ----,
644,WRITTEN FOR ----,"But her face wore the same quiet features,"
645,WRITTEN FOR ----,And her smile was enhancing the light
646,WRITTEN FOR ----,"That fell on this friend of my bosom,"
647,WRITTEN FOR ----,This angel robed softly in white.
648,WRITTEN FOR ----,
649,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I longed to reach upward and touch her,"
650,WRITTEN FOR ----,To ask why the flowers she twined;
651,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Wondered often for whom was the garland,"
652,WRITTEN FOR ----,And the crown with the lily buds lined.
653,WRITTEN FOR ----,
654,WRITTEN FOR ----,So I cried and my voice soared onward
655,WRITTEN FOR ----,Farther than sight could extend--
656,WRITTEN FOR ----,"""For whom are you weaving this chaplet?"
657,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Speak, Scotta! sweet spirit and friend."""
658,WRITTEN FOR ----,
659,WRITTEN FOR ----,"""O! tell me just why from the portals"
660,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Of Heaven you've wandered away,"
661,WRITTEN FOR ----,And sit here alone by the river
662,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Wreathing these lilies to-day."""
663,WRITTEN FOR ----,
664,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Her lips parted, as if for an answer--"
665,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Then a cluster of cherubim, came--"
666,WRITTEN FOR ----,"They hovered about this sweet seraph,"
667,WRITTEN FOR ----,And whispered in concert _a name_.
668,WRITTEN FOR ----,
669,WRITTEN FOR ----,"It resounded along Heaven's archway,"
670,WRITTEN FOR ----,"But soft on my ear that word fell,"
671,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Soft as her accents of friendship,"
672,WRITTEN FOR ----,Soft as a Sabbath eve bell.
673,WRITTEN FOR ----,
674,WRITTEN FOR ----,And the dewdrops and spray of the river
675,WRITTEN FOR ----,"On the garlands to crystals had turned,"
676,WRITTEN FOR ----,"The crown she embedded with snow-drops,"
677,WRITTEN FOR ----,One jewel there glittered and burned.
678,WRITTEN FOR ----,
679,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Its luster was brilliant and sunlike,"
680,WRITTEN FOR ----,"As burnished as those in the throne,"
681,WRITTEN FOR ----,But the name that her own gentle fingers
682,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Had carved there, ah! me, was--_my own_."
683,WRITTEN FOR ----,
684,WRITTEN FOR ----,And what if Life's thorns pressed my temples
685,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Or sorrow to midnight turns day,"
686,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I will press on alone through the darkness,"
687,WRITTEN FOR ----,Believing her hand leads the way.
688,WRITTEN FOR ----,
689,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I will traverse the chill ""Swamp of Cypress"""
690,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Where the ""Rivers of Death"" slowly wind;"
691,WRITTEN FOR ----,"For she'll beckon me over with garlands,"
692,WRITTEN FOR ----,And the crown with the lily buds lined.
693,WRITTEN FOR ----,
694,WRITTEN FOR ----,
695,WRITTEN FOR ----,
696,WRITTEN FOR ----,
697,WRITTEN FOR ----,The Lover and Flower.
698,WRITTEN FOR ----,
699,WRITTEN FOR ----,
700,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I found it, one day, in a pretty shade"
701,WRITTEN FOR ----,Which a vine and a maple together made;
702,WRITTEN FOR ----,"'Twas blooming away in a dress of white,"
703,WRITTEN FOR ----,With eyes of a blue transparent light.
704,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I knelt at its shrine,"
705,WRITTEN FOR ----,And this heart of mine
706,WRITTEN FOR ----,Drank in the fragrance as one drinks wine.
707,WRITTEN FOR ----,
708,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Then I said, ""Sweet flower, this cooling shade"
709,WRITTEN FOR ----,"With the summer weather will dim and fade,"
710,WRITTEN FOR ----,There's a place in my heart--a cozy room--
711,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Where you may nestle and grow and bloom."""
712,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Thus I wooed the flower,"
713,WRITTEN FOR ----,"In this shady bower,"
714,WRITTEN FOR ----,And lovers we were that self-same hour.
715,WRITTEN FOR ----,
716,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I carried it home, I pruned it with care,"
717,WRITTEN FOR ----,I gave it the sun and the morning air.
718,WRITTEN FOR ----,"The honey bees came its dew to sip,"
719,WRITTEN FOR ----,But I drove them away with pouting lip;
720,WRITTEN FOR ----,"For I loved my flower,"
721,WRITTEN FOR ----,And with jealous power
722,WRITTEN FOR ----,I banished the bees from our curtained bower.
723,WRITTEN FOR ----,
724,WRITTEN FOR ----,"A butterfly came on wings of lace,"
725,WRITTEN FOR ----,And tried to fan my blossom's face;
726,WRITTEN FOR ----,"But I brushed it away with cruel hands,"
727,WRITTEN FOR ----,And tore from its wings the velvet bands;
728,WRITTEN FOR ----,Then I kissed my flower;
729,WRITTEN FOR ----,But a summer shower
730,WRITTEN FOR ----,Burst from the clouds with mesmeric power.
731,WRITTEN FOR ----,
732,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Then the pale little blossom heaved a sigh,"
733,WRITTEN FOR ----,And opened a blue and timid eye
734,WRITTEN FOR ----,"To thank the cloud as it did in the shade,"
735,WRITTEN FOR ----,Which the vine and the maple together made;
736,WRITTEN FOR ----,But my heart would rebel;
737,WRITTEN FOR ----,I could not quell
738,WRITTEN FOR ----,Its raging fire--it seemed from hell.
739,WRITTEN FOR ----,
740,WRITTEN FOR ----,I slammed the shutters with curses of doom;
741,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I made it dark as a dungeon room,"
742,WRITTEN FOR ----,Then I hurried away like a thief in the night;
743,WRITTEN FOR ----,"But I strolled again in the warm sunlight,"
744,WRITTEN FOR ----,And another flower
745,WRITTEN FOR ----,From Fashion's own bower
746,WRITTEN FOR ----,"I culled, and nursed it only an hour."
747,WRITTEN FOR ----,
748,WRITTEN FOR ----,"It proved but a weed with a gaudy bloom,"
749,WRITTEN FOR ----,And a poisonous odor filled my room.
750,WRITTEN FOR ----,"So I turned once more to my wildwood flower,"
751,WRITTEN FOR ----,"That I locked in my heart that sinful hour,"
752,WRITTEN FOR ----,"When the angel of love,"
753,WRITTEN FOR ----,"To its mansion above,"
754,WRITTEN FOR ----,Had fluttered away like a wounded dove.
755,WRITTEN FOR ----,
756,WRITTEN FOR ----,How softly I turned the key in my heart;
757,WRITTEN FOR ----,One moment I faltered--the door swung apart--
758,WRITTEN FOR ----,"A faint, sweet essence, like heliotrope bloom,"
759,WRITTEN FOR ----,Was sick'ning my senses; I moved through the room
760,WRITTEN FOR ----,"With a staggering tread,"
761,WRITTEN FOR ----,"With a brain reeling head,"
762,WRITTEN FOR ----,And swooned there--_a murd'rer_--my flower was--_dead_.
763,WRITTEN FOR ----,
764,WRITTEN FOR ----,
765,WRITTEN FOR ----,
766,WRITTEN FOR ----,
767,WRITTEN FOR ----,My Cloud--To Scotta.
768,WRITTEN FOR ----,
769,WRITTEN FOR ----,
770,WRITTEN FOR ----,There's a cloud on my life's horizon
771,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Of wonderful shape and hue,"
772,WRITTEN FOR ----,Like the feathery down of a snow-drift
773,WRITTEN FOR ----,'Tis dimpled with changeful blue.
774,WRITTEN FOR ----,I gaze on its shadowy outline
775,WRITTEN FOR ----,"And drink in the calm of the skies,"
776,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Till I fancy it floats out of heaven,"
777,WRITTEN FOR ----,As an angel in disguise.
778,WRITTEN FOR ----,
779,WRITTEN FOR ----,"No slumbering storm in its bosom,"
780,WRITTEN FOR ----,"No hint of the lightning's glare,"
781,WRITTEN FOR ----,Only a feast for the heart and soul
782,WRITTEN FOR ----,Is this treasure of the air;
783,WRITTEN FOR ----,"For I know from its silvery edges,"
784,WRITTEN FOR ----,"And glimpses of hidden gold,"
785,WRITTEN FOR ----,That a picture of rare tranquility
786,WRITTEN FOR ----,Its tender depths enfold.
787,WRITTEN FOR ----,
788,WRITTEN FOR ----,Else whence is this mystic feeling
789,WRITTEN FOR ----,Of peace that's stealing o'er me?
790,WRITTEN FOR ----,Like the magic of summer moonlight
791,WRITTEN FOR ----,Enchanting a restless sea.
792,WRITTEN FOR ----,O! heavenly cloud! why are you
793,WRITTEN FOR ----,"So calm? so angelic you seem,"
794,WRITTEN FOR ----,My spirit escapes in its longing--
795,WRITTEN FOR ----,I am lost in a beautiful dream.
796,WRITTEN FOR ----,
797,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Up, up on the wings of a swallow"
798,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Piercing the heaven's deep blue,"
799,WRITTEN FOR ----,"O'er meadow and mount I am rising,"
800,WRITTEN FOR ----,"And floating, sweet spirit, to you;"
801,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Onward, in trance I am wafted,"
802,WRITTEN FOR ----,Now into the cloudlet above;
803,WRITTEN FOR ----,"And a face smiles out from its drapery,"
804,WRITTEN FOR ----,And ah! 'tis a face that I love.
805,WRITTEN FOR ----,
806,WRITTEN FOR ----,
807,WRITTEN FOR ----,
808,WRITTEN FOR ----,
809,WRITTEN FOR ----,The Decision.
810,WRITTEN FOR ----,
811,WRITTEN FOR ----,
812,WRITTEN FOR ----,A dispute once arose in a bee-hive
813,WRITTEN FOR ----,As to which of the little brown bees

817,WRITTEN FOR ----,The queen tried in vain to discover
818,WRITTEN FOR ----,Some method the riot to quell;
819,WRITTEN FOR ----,"But a challenge for war had been sounded,"
820,WRITTEN FOR ----,And threatened was each honey cell.
821,WRITTEN FOR ----,
822,WRITTEN FOR ----,So she spoke in a voice most persuasive--
823,WRITTEN FOR ----,"""He shall sit on my throne for an hour,"
824,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Who brings from the store-house of nature,"
825,WRITTEN FOR ----,"The juice of the sweetest-lipped flower."""
826,WRITTEN FOR ----,
827,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Away flew the brown little workers,"
828,WRITTEN FOR ----,Away out of sight o'er the hill;
829,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Then backward and forward they flitted,"
830,WRITTEN FOR ----,The honey-cups eager to fill.
831,WRITTEN FOR ----,
832,WRITTEN FOR ----,"One famished the heart of a lily,"
833,WRITTEN FOR ----,And drank from its milky bud;
834,WRITTEN FOR ----,"One opened the vein of a rose leaf,"
835,WRITTEN FOR ----,And licked up the crimson blood.
836,WRITTEN FOR ----,
837,WRITTEN FOR ----,"To a poppy-bed still one hurried,"
838,WRITTEN FOR ----,"On a downy cot he crept,"
839,WRITTEN FOR ----,"But all-day in the silken blankets,"

841,WRITTEN FOR ----,
842,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Another flew off to the meadow,"
843,WRITTEN FOR ----,And punctured the daisy's cap;
844,WRITTEN FOR ----,"A swarm had encompassed a fountain,"
845,WRITTEN FOR ----,Where gurgled the sugar-tree sap.
846,WRITTEN FOR ----,
847,WRITTEN FOR ----,A fourth and a fifth to a mansion

851,WRITTEN FOR ----,
852,WRITTEN FOR ----,"But the sixth one paused at a cottage,"
853,WRITTEN FOR ----,Where a sick girl sleeping lay;
854,WRITTEN FOR ----,"And there by the open window,"
855,WRITTEN FOR ----,Blossomed a hyacinth spray.
856,WRITTEN FOR ----,
857,WRITTEN FOR ----,"A youth stood near in the shadows,"
858,WRITTEN FOR ----,"And watching the dreamer's face,"
859,WRITTEN FOR ----,A tear rolled down from his eyelid
860,WRITTEN FOR ----,And fell on the hyacinth vase.
861,WRITTEN FOR ----,
862,WRITTEN FOR ----,It was only the work of a moment
863,WRITTEN FOR ----,"For a busy bee to do,"
864,WRITTEN FOR ----,To flavor affections tear-drop
865,WRITTEN FOR ----,"With the extract, ""flower-dew."""
866,WRITTEN FOR ----,
867,WRITTEN FOR ----,"So he gathered this precious honey,"
868,WRITTEN FOR ----,"And, polishing up his sting,"
869,WRITTEN FOR ----,"He flitted out of the window,"
870,WRITTEN FOR ----,With gold dust under his wing.
871,WRITTEN FOR ----,
872,WRITTEN FOR ----,Such a night in the little bee-hive

876,WRITTEN FOR ----,
877,WRITTEN FOR ----,
878,WRITTEN FOR ----,
879,WRITTEN FOR ----,
880,WRITTEN FOR ----,Autumn.
881,WRITTEN FOR ----,
882,WRITTEN FOR ----,
883,WRITTEN FOR ----,Who is it that paints the woodlands
884,WRITTEN FOR ----,Like a gorgeous gown of gold;
885,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Dropping, here and there, a ripple"
886,WRITTEN FOR ----,Of vermilion in each fold?
887,WRITTEN FOR ----,Who is it that calls the robins
888,WRITTEN FOR ----,And the blackbirds into bands;
889,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Pointing them with flaming fingers,"
890,WRITTEN FOR ----,"To the sunny, Southern lands?"
891,WRITTEN FOR ----,
892,WRITTEN FOR ----,What has scorched the tender blossoms?
893,WRITTEN FOR ----,In our yards they're dying now.
894,WRITTEN FOR ----,Do you know who kissed the apple

896,WRITTEN FOR ----,Why so mute the little streamlet?
897,WRITTEN FOR ----,Down the hill it used to leap;
898,WRITTEN FOR ----,Now I faintly hear it sobbing--
899,WRITTEN FOR ----,Sobbing out like one in sleep.
900,WRITTEN FOR ----,
901,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Leaden clouds lay on the heavens,"

903,WRITTEN FOR ----,"And the winds together whisper,"
904,WRITTEN FOR ----,Sad as loved ones ere they part.
905,WRITTEN FOR ----,Then anon a dreamy dullness
906,WRITTEN FOR ----,Hovers over sky and earth;
907,WRITTEN FOR ----,"Ah! my soul reflects the sadness,"
908,WRITTEN FOR ----,And I seek my friendly hearth.
909,WRITTEN FOR ----,

927,TO IDA.,"She knelt beside her brother's grave,"
928,TO IDA.,The day was near its close;
929,TO IDA.,"And where the cool, tall grasses wave,"
930,TO IDA.,She lay a fresh-cut rose.
931,TO IDA.,"Then, from a silver waiter near,"
932,TO IDA.,"She drew a wreath of white,"
933,TO IDA.,"Besprinkled with the twilight's tear,"
934,TO IDA.,"O'ershaded with the night,"
935,TO IDA.,And placed them on the green-kept mound.
936,TO IDA.,"I watched her kneeling there,"
937,TO IDA.,"Her face bent on the sacred ground,"
938,TO IDA.,In attitude of prayer;
939,TO IDA.,"And while a bird sang soft his hymn,"
940,TO IDA.,"Down-looking from above,"
941,TO IDA.,We saw unveiled a picture dim--

956,TO IDA.,"Then could I melodize in song,"
957,TO IDA.,Her life so pure and true.
958,TO IDA.,
959,TO IDA.,Or could I weave into this song
960,TO IDA.,"Her smile, so rich and rare,"
961,TO IDA.,"That found its way to every heart,"
962,TO IDA.,And left its halo there--
963,TO IDA.,"Then earth would not seem desolate,"
964,TO IDA.,"Or days be lone or long,"
965,TO IDA.,Since she would sweetly live again
966,TO IDA.,"In verse, and smile in song."

994,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,And help the banquet room to line--

996,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,
997,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,My starry flowers--this purple heath--
998,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,She'll gather for that trailing wreath;

1002,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,
1003,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,"To watch with me her trembling sigh,"
1004,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,The golden pansy's modest eye

1011,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,
1012,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,A Problem.
1013,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,
1014,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,
1015,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,"My heart is perplexed, though I've tried to discover"
1016,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,"An answer to solve what it is that I miss,"
1017,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,"Though I've questioned myself more that twenty times over,"
1018,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,There seems no reply to a question like this.

1020,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,"Salutations of praises and sometimes a kiss,"
1021,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,And looks sent along with a sweet flower token.
1022,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,I find in my room--there is something I miss.
1023,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,
1024,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,"The blaze up the chimney this evening is talking,"
1025,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,"The wind and the shutter hum sad an old tune,"

1033,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,"I stir down the embers, and here in the firelight"
1034,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,"I read the home paper a late train has brought,"
1035,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,And into the lives of the absent an insight

1041,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,
1042,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,Will it always be thus? Is this one missing measure

1045,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,And in the heart's casket the setting make strong.
1046,TO MRS. T. R. WALTON.,But I have grown weary these figures of trying;

1059,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I built me a little palace,"

1061,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Wherein my soul might revel
1062,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And rest at my command.
1063,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","The spot, a royal summit,"
1064,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I let my will select,"
1065,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And Fancy came inspecting
1066,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","With Thought, the architect."
1067,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1068,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",We went down to the quarry
1069,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","For the foundation rock,"
1070,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And purchased hewn and polished
1071,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Love's marble corner block.
1072,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","For years we toiled together,"
1073,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And one day warm and sweet
1074,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",I woke and found my palace
1075,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Before me and complete.
1076,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1077,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",It was a gorgeous building--
1078,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",The window lights of red
1079,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Came from the sunset's furnace,"
1080,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Or Northern light instead.
1081,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Each peak, each tower and turret"
1082,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","The sunlight's love had won,"

1084,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","From heaven and said ""well done."""
1085,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1086,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I planted a grove beyond it,"
1087,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And hedged up the terraced yard,"
1088,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And I dug a groove so a brooklet
1089,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Could play on the level sward.
1090,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I wanted a flower to cheer me,"
1091,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And off on a breezy slope
1092,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",I scattered the seed of roses
1093,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And the purple heliotrope.
1094,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1095,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",I peopled the rooms with volumes
1096,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Of men with talents rare,"
1097,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Who climbed upon Fame's spire
1098,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And waved their banners there.
1099,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I purchased the costliest paintings,"
1100,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And swung them from the walls;
1101,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And music, like harps of heaven,"
1102,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Resounded throughout the halls.
1103,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1104,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I gave a royal banquet,"
1105,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","The nuptial feast was spread,"
1106,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And then, when all was ready,"
1107,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",There Love and I were wed.
1108,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","But when the guests departed,"
1109,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","A rap came on the door,"
1110,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And a gaunt figure faced me
1111,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",I ne'er had seen before.
1112,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1113,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","""My name,"" she said, ""is Envy;"
1114,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",I wish to stop with you;
1115,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Your dwelling just completed,"
1116,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","The inmates must be few."""
1117,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Her breath, like fumes of sulphur,"
1118,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Into my face was blown,"
1119,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And like a demon's curses
1120,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Was her departing tone.
1121,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1122,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","The night came on, and fingers"
1123,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Tapped on the beveled glass,"
1124,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",A face looked in the window
1125,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",With eyes that shone like brass;
1126,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","But Love beheld the visage,"
1127,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And o'er the window drew
1128,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",A shade that shut Suspicion
1129,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Forever from my view.
1130,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1131,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And then a pond'rous knocking
1132,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Bombarded at the door,"
1133,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And like an earthquake's tremor
1134,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Upheaved the palace floor.
1135,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I glanced into the key-hole,"
1136,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And, like the brand of Cain,"
1137,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",I saw on Slander's forehead
1138,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",A dark and bloody stain.
1139,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1140,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I barred the palace entrance,"
1141,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And turning in the hall
1142,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",We faced another figure
1143,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",More dreadful than them all;
1144,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","He said: ""My name is Ruin--"

1153,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And then he smote the castle,"
1154,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","It trembled to its base,"
1155,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And fell? No, no--I shouted"
1156,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And laughed out in his face:
1157,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1158,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","""You can not wreck our palace,"
1159,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Love is the corner stone,"
1160,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And we are master workmen,"""
1161,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I said, in jocund tone."
1162,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","He seized his trailing garments,"
1163,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Departed with a groan,"
1164,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And love and I together
1165,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Were once more left alone.
1166,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1167,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Next day as they debated
1168,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","What course to next pursue,"
1169,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",I heard a sweet voice calling--
1170,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Love said the tone he knew.
1171,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","The step, low as a mother's"
1172,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Upon the nursery floor,"
1173,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Was like advancing music
1174,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",That halted at our door.
1175,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1176,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",As when a fairy's castle
1177,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Yields to a magic key,"
1178,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Our door swung on the hinges
1179,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",The guest was--_Sympathy_.
1180,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","""Come in, our worthy sister,"""
1181,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",I heard Love then repeat;
1182,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","""For happiness without you"
1183,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Could never be complete."""
1184,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1185,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And while we sat together,"
1186,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Weaving our garland sweet,"
1187,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","For many a bridal altar,"
1188,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","For many a burial sheet,"
1189,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",We heard another footstep;
1190,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And, like an angel sent,"
1191,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",There came and smiled upon us
1192,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",The face we loved--_Content_.
1193,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1194,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",The circle was completed--
1195,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",My palace stands sublime
1196,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Still on that cloudland summit,"
1197,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And laughs at threats of Time.
1198,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","No curses thunder o'er us,"
1199,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",No heavy rains can fall;
1200,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",For heaven's open window

1211,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",The last accent that she utters
1212,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",I'll record here at her feet.
1213,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","See, the pulses quiver faintly,"
1214,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","But her heart, alas! 'tis still;"
1215,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","See how pale she lies and saintly,"
1216,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Feel her hands, they're white and chill."

1227,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","There the two like sisters sorrow,"
1228,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","As above the corse they bend,"
1229,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Planning for the sad to-morrow--
1230,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",For the burial of a friend.
1231,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Then the daisy from the mountain,"
1232,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","That in mourning shawl was dressed,"
1233,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Brought a snowdrow from the fountain,"
1234,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Lay it on the summer's breast.
1235,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1236,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","To the pillow crept the lilacs,"
1237,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",But the flowers at her throat
1238,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Were the heliotrope and smilax--
1239,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",This was gained by casting vote--
1240,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And the jasmine sought her fingers,"
1241,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",While the fuschias kissed her hair;
1242,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",At her lip a violet lingers
1243,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","To deny them, who would dare?"
1244,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1245,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Then the autumn's sunny treasure
1246,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Came the sturdy golden rod,"
1247,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","For the coffin took the measure,"
1248,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",For the grave removed the sod.
1249,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Long and mournful the procession
1250,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","That I watched across the hill,"
1251,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","For to you I'll make confession,"
1252,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Autumn doth my spirit kill.
1253,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1254,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Drives me from the scene of sadness
1255,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",While on poison nature feeds;
1256,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Decks her out in robes of gladness
1257,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",To conceal the heart that bleeds;
1258,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",At the summer's grave there lingers
1259,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",None more sad to drop a tear
1260,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Than the friend whose trembling fingers
1261,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Write this in memoriam here.

1263,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1264,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",

1266,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Spring and Summer.

1268,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1269,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I heard a footstep on the hill,"
1270,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","The little brook began to trill,"
1271,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I looked--a sweet and childlike face,"
1272,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Reflected like a blooming vase,"
1273,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Was smiling from the water clear,"
1274,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",With buttercups behind her ear.
1275,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1276,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","A flock of swallows hove in sight,"
1277,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","On came the summer clad in white,"
1278,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",With sunshine falling from her hair
1279,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Upon her shoulders white and bare,"
1280,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And pressing through the tangled grass,"
1281,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",A daisy rose to watch her pass.
1282,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1283,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1284,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1285,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1286,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Under the Snow.
1287,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1288,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1289,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","What have you hidden down under the snow,"
1290,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",So dear that you weep when the northern blasts blow?
1291,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Why your face pressed to the cold window pane,"
1292,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Longing to mingle your tears with the rain--
1293,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Is there something down under the snow?
1294,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1295,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Is it only a blossom, a summer's delight,"
1296,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","That is freezing and dying this cold, bitter night?"
1297,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","That is only a fancy, the floweret is warm,"
1298,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And the drift has enfolded it safe from the storm--
1299,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Is there something yet under the snow?
1300,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1301,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Something near to the heart down under the snow,"
1302,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","That has robbed the wan cheek of its once carmine glow,"
1303,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",That has stolen the beam of the eye--tears instead
1304,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Bespeak how in anguish the sore heart hath bled
1305,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",For a little child under the snow.
1306,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1307,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","For a dear little prattler that littered the floor,"
1308,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And laughed as he tumbled your work o'er and o'er
1309,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","For a little gold head that made sunny the room,"
1310,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Now bright'ning the darkness and chill of the tomb,"
1311,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",That is dreaming out under the snow.
1312,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1313,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Only resting awhile in garments all white,"
1314,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Away from the blackness and sin of to-night;
1315,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Away from the vice and the wrong of the street,"
1316,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Not heeding the song of the rain or the sleet,"
1317,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Still sleeping down under the snow.
1318,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1319,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",How many a mother her darling would lay
1320,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","In the last, narrow home--hide her treasure away--"
1321,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",If only to know its soul was at rest
1322,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","With an innocent heart in an innocent breast,"

1330,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1331,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Have you e'er seen her, this beautiful girl"
1332,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",With that classical head and complexion of pearl?
1333,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",So pale and enchanting that sometimes I deem
1334,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Her a sweet revelation as when in a dream,"
1335,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Through wild variations of trouble and fear,"
1336,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",You suddenly feel that an angel is near.
1337,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Now guess, if you can, without half of that frown,"
1338,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",For to me she's the prettiest girl in the town.
1339,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1340,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",The poets all sing of these quaint Highland girls
1341,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",With enchanting dimples and loose tangled curls;
1342,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Or they weave a love-tale from her budding lip's glow
1343,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",While chasing the reindeer o'er mountains of snow;
1344,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","This is only the skill of a well tinctured pen,"
1345,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Dipped in Romance's cup for the praises of men,"
1346,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Who value this maid in the coarse homespun gown
1347,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Something less than the prettiest girl in the town.
1348,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1349,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","You must all have watched the calm light of her eyes,"
1350,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And ethereal figure with heavy drawn sighs;
1351,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Pondered often in secret of some magic gift
1352,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",To win you this face--so like a snowdrift--
1353,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I would whisper a secret: On Valentine's day,"
1354,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","With Cupid commune in a sly, cunning way,"
1355,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Else only in dreams she is thine; for a crown
1356,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Could not purchase the prettiest girl in the town.

1363,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1364,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I am musing to-night in the fire-light's glow,"
1365,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And watching the pictures that come and go;
1366,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Like dissolving views on a magic screen
1367,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Is the witchery of this changing scene;
1368,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Though half I'm dreaming, though half awake,"
1369,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I fear to move lest the spell I break,"
1370,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Lest my fairy castles will break and fall,"
1371,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And down will tumble each beautiful wall.
1372,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1373,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Thus still in a stupor I sit and gaze
1374,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",At the glowing embers and wanton blaze;
1375,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",I am smiling at Fancy; she tries in vain
1376,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",To lure me along with the mad'ning train
1377,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","That follow her footsteps--that to her cling,"
1378,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",As flowers that garland the steps of spring;
1379,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","In moody silence I sit apart,"
1380,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Till memory conquers my sullen heart.
1381,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1382,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Sweet Memory! sprite of my golden past!
1383,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Your tinseled veil o'er me is cast;
1384,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Subdued I yield like one enchained,"
1385,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And yet my freedom is only feigned;
1386,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Back through the aisles of years that are gone,"
1387,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","A willing captive you lead me on,"
1388,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Where I gleaned unbidden the joys of youth
1389,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",While the world was blossoming with love and truth.
1390,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1391,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Before my heart could interpret a sigh,"
1392,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Or a tear-drop's shadow creep into my eye,"
1393,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Ere I'd missed from the circle of friendship's chain
1394,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","The link once lost that we ne'er regain,"
1395,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","The future to me was a vast expanse,"
1396,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Its depth I could solve at a single glance,"
1397,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Knew not of the troubles that torture the soul
1398,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Hidden away in its sober fold.
1399,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1400,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Yet, to-night, as I dream in the gathering gloom,"

1402,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","Those who gladdened my life in its season of pain,"
1403,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Like a gleam of the sunshine along with the rain;
1404,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","These, _these_ are the guests that encircle my hearth,"
1405,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Who come gliding like spirits back to the earth.
1406,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",What communion we hold only those ever know
1407,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Who sit musing alone in the fire-light's glow.

1417,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And whose leaves held the odor of ages,"
1418,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And the imprints of much usage wore,"
1419,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","A little brown curl I discovered,"
1420,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",That fell from the book to the floor.
1421,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1422,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Had I sinned? Heaven grant me its pardon.
1423,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Did a lover's sad tear the page spot?

1427,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And all of its sweetness forgot.
1428,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1429,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","I held the curl up to the lamplight,"
1430,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","And watching the gleam of its gold,"
1431,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","There I heard with the rush of the midnight,"
1432,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",A sad little story it told;
1433,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",But I promised the sacred old volume
1434,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",Its secret I would not unfold.
1435,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",
1436,"MADISONVILLE, KY.","But I would that the world knew its sorrow,"
1437,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",The story I must not reveal;
1438,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",But go to your book case to-morrow.
1439,"MADISONVILLE, KY.",And each to your own heart appeal;

1455,TO M. A. B.,"A red rose to kiss and to fondle,"
1456,TO M. A. B.,Whose leaves will not wither or die--
1457,TO M. A. B.,To gladden each moment and banish
1458,TO M. A. B.,The winter thoughts out of the sky.
1459,TO M. A. B.,
1460,TO M. A. B.,I want a low ripple of music
1461,TO M. A. B.,"To flow through these lines of my choice,"
1462,TO M. A. B.,"Like a zephyr that moved through the summer,"
1463,TO M. A. B.,Now dwelling in somebody's voice;

1465,TO M. A. B.,So sweet that its magic of words

1471,TO M. A. B.,To mix with the clouds of November
1472,TO M. A. B.,"They'll still wear the dark, sober hue;"

1480,TO M. A. B.,"Your sweet, rosy face would be tangled"
1481,TO M. A. B.,By a memory cunning and strong?
1482,TO M. A. B.,That the eyes looking now on this pattern
1483,TO M. A. B.,Would find it so easy to trace?
1484,TO M. A. B.,And delight as I do in its beauty--

1501,TO M. A. B.,
1502,TO M. A. B.,"It is memory's beacon lantern,"
1503,TO M. A. B.,O'er it arching is your name;

1544,TO M. A. B.,"The toad croaks near my humble fire,"

1548,TO M. A. B.,"The bats flit idly to and fro,"
1549,TO M. A. B.,"The mice romp through my cell,"

1552,TO M. A. B.,
1553,TO M. A. B.,"I move, and think 'tis some weird dream"

1555,TO M. A. B.,For here around my throbbing brow
1556,TO M. A. B.,"Seems clamped a heavy chain,"
1557,TO M. A. B.,And like a prisoner doomed to die
1558,TO M. A. B.,"To-morrow at the stake,"
1559,TO M. A. B.,"I count the hours as they fly,"
1560,TO M. A. B.,And dread the morning's break.

1562,TO M. A. B.,"For friends will come to lead me forth,"

1564,TO M. A. B.,To homes where kindred ties await;
1565,TO M. A. B.,I fear the hermit's doom.
1566,TO M. A. B.,They've tempted me--I fain would rest
1567,TO M. A. B.,"Here on the dungeon mould,"
1568,TO M. A. B.,Than dream on beds where curtains swing
1569,TO M. A. B.,With sunbeams in each fold.
1570,TO M. A. B.,
1571,TO M. A. B.,For beasts and birds and creeping things
1572,TO M. A. B.,"Have owned me as their guest,"
1573,TO M. A. B.,When man would turn me from his door
1574,TO M. A. B.,With cruel word or jest;
1575,TO M. A. B.,"And as I served my scanty meal,"
1576,TO M. A. B.,"In supplicating lays,"
1577,TO M. A. B.,The cricket and the katydid
1578,TO M. A. B.,Would join my evening praise.
1579,TO M. A. B.,
1580,TO M. A. B.,"God pitied me, my loneliness"
1581,TO M. A. B.,He made a sweet content;
1582,TO M. A. B.,I found companions in the stars
1583,TO M. A. B.,That from the heavens bent;
1584,TO M. A. B.,"His flowers were friends, the golden rod"
1585,TO M. A. B.,"Smiled in its yellow hood,"
1586,TO M. A. B.,A sentinel about my door
1587,TO M. A. B.,The purple thistle stood.
1588,TO M. A. B.,
1589,TO M. A. B.,But look! the morning's amber hue
1590,TO M. A. B.,"Steals on the Easter skies,"
1591,TO M. A. B.,Farewell! farewell! when Death has closed
1592,TO M. A. B.,"These dim and longing eyes,"
1593,TO M. A. B.,"In peace to slumber here entombed,"
1594,TO M. A. B.,"Will be the boon I crave,"

1602,TO M. A. B.,
1603,TO M. A. B.,
1604,TO M. A. B.,There's an old-fashioned building somewhere in the town
1605,TO M. A. B.,"That looks on a noisy street,"
1606,TO M. A. B.,"And no matter how often I pass up and down,"
1607,TO M. A. B.,At the window sweet faces I meet.
1608,TO M. A. B.,"Little faces that lit'rally beam on the street,"
1609,TO M. A. B.,"Untutored in Life's trying school,"

1611,TO M. A. B.,"For our lesson the sweet, golden rule."
1612,TO M. A. B.,
1613,TO M. A. B.,"Oft they give us a smile, when a frown we return"
1614,TO M. A. B.,"A kiss prompts the pout of their lip,"
1615,TO M. A. B.,"And though we go by with a step proud and stern,"
1616,TO M. A. B.,How lightly beside us they trip!
1617,TO M. A. B.,"Catching the leaves that drift in at the door,"
1618,TO M. A. B.,"Those pretty leaves rusted with rain,"
1619,TO M. A. B.,"That sigh with our hearts when the summer is o'er,"
1620,TO M. A. B.,And that seem to wear traces of pain.
1621,TO M. A. B.,
1622,TO M. A. B.,"There is many a window with drapings of lace,"
1623,TO M. A. B.,"Where the clematis bloom is entwined,"
1624,TO M. A. B.,"Where the moss seems a part of the urn and the vase,"
1625,TO M. A. B.,"Where the awning with satin is lined,"
1626,TO M. A. B.,Where Wealth sits aloof--garments dripping with pearls
1627,TO M. A. B.,"Like a Mermaid's--sole god of the sphere,"
1628,TO M. A. B.,But the faces I love with their billows of curls
1629,TO M. A. B.,You must ne'er think of looking for here.
1630,TO M. A. B.,
1631,TO M. A. B.,"For the window I love has no hangings of plush,"
1632,TO M. A. B.,"Neither festooned as if for display,"
1633,TO M. A. B.,And yet I have seen it at evening's soft hush
1634,TO M. A. B.,Decked out in a wond'rous array
1635,TO M. A. B.,"Of cambrics and calicoes, sashes and curls,"
1636,TO M. A. B.,Little aprons and many a toy--
1637,TO M. A. B.,"More plainly to speak--there are three little girls,"
1638,TO M. A. B.,And the king of the house is a boy.
1639,TO M. A. B.,
1640,TO M. A. B.,"How I love to halt here! With a satisfied look,"
1641,TO M. A. B.,"I have watched Corinne smoothing a curl,"
1642,TO M. A. B.,"I have seen little Richard lean over his book,"
1643,TO M. A. B.,I have heard Mary singing with Pearl.
1644,TO M. A. B.,And O! I have thanked them again and again
1645,TO M. A. B.,For the problems of patience and love
1646,TO M. A. B.,That they solve unawares for my less practiced brain
1647,TO M. A. B.,When I pause by the window I love.

1694,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,"As we strive to remove from the soul an old strain,"
1695,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,Thus the outline I've tried to erase from my brain;
1696,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,But a specter stands near with sepulchral face.
1697,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,And over my hearthstone the same scene doth trace--
1698,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,"She colors the landscape and scoffs at my tears,"
1699,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,As I gaze on the wreck of scarce twenty-one years.
1700,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,
1701,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,"'Twas the home of my boyhood. In ruins it stood,"

1707,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,"Not a wild flower bloomed--through my heart ran a chill,"
1708,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,As I bowed by the spring at the foot of the hill.
1709,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,
1710,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,No trickle of water fell soft on my ear--
1711,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,Unless 'twas the sound of a swift falling tear--
1712,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,"For Time in his raving had paused here to drink,"
1713,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,And I found only dregs as I gasped on the brink.
1714,TO REV. H. T. WILSON.,"Long I stood, and I gazed like one in a trance,"

1902,TO M. BARLOW.,
1903,TO M. BARLOW.,That it bids me look into the granary room

1905,TO M. BARLOW.,And anon to glance in with the sundown's bloom
1906,TO M. BARLOW.,"Where the snowy flour is sacked,"

1971,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"I fill my cup again, again,"

1975,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
1976,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,And black-eyed Easter trips along
1977,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"The kitchen porch with smile and song,"
1978,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"We find a poem in her churn,"
1979,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,An essence in her coffee urn;
1980,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
1981,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,We note the pale dyspeptic's cheek
1982,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Is growing rosy, round, and sleek;"
1983,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"His torpid stomach forced to fast,"
1984,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,Here soon partakes the rich repast.

1995,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
1996,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,I deem that morning holds more charms
1997,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,Than day hides elsewhere in her arms;

2001,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"A newer phase doth nature take,"

2008,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,And others saunter to the pool
2009,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,Their tired limbs to bathe and cool.
2010,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2011,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,But give me just the shady rook

2016,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Of the old spring that drips and drips,"
2017,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,To cool and cure the fever lips.
2018,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,Who could forget the landlord's vim

2034,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Yet long we for it, as a weary bird"
2035,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,Longs all in vain to rest upon a cloud
2036,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,That heavenward floats. And yet there's solace still
2037,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"In musing on her faith so strong and pure,"
2038,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"That recognized, through pain, God's every wish,"
2039,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,And dreaded not to taste death's cup if so
2040,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,By Him decreed.
2041,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,I was not there to hold
2042,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,Her hand; it chilled within the orphan's palm
2043,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,Until by angels clasp'd. I could not twine
2044,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"The flowers she so much loved about her shroud,"
2045,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,Or speak a word of comfort to the friends
2046,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"That sobbed, and kissed the lips grown strangely cold,"
2047,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,That never parted but to speak in praise
2048,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,When others tried to censure; but my heart
2049,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Beats sad to-day the measures of my verse,"
2050,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,And tear-drops fall.
2051,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,So falls the autumn rain
2052,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Upon her grave, and drifting are the leaves"
2053,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,Upon the mound that loving friends have raised
2054,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"In memory of her, whose spirit rests"
2055,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,To-day with God.
2056,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2057,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2058,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2059,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2060,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,The Old Orchard Trees.
2061,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2062,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2063,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Why cut them away? The dear old trees,"
2064,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"They never did aught of harm,"
2065,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"But scattered their perfume out to the breeze,"
2066,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,And sheltered the birds from the storm.
2067,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2068,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"For an age they have stood on the town's outer meads,"
2069,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,The skirmish and battle have braved;
2070,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Alike they have gazed on the war's bloody deeds,"
2071,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,And the white flag of peace as it waved.
2072,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2073,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,But you cut them away! my pleading is vain!
2074,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"In their shade moves the carpenter's hands,"
2075,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"I watched him to-day as he leveled his plane,"
2076,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,And he spoke of the architect's plans.
2077,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2078,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Then a wave of distress in my heart flowed anew,"
2079,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,For dearly I love each old tree;
2080,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,Ah me! many secrets are hidden from you
2081,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,That the apple trees whispered to me.
2082,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2083,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"I used to go by, and the sweet morning air,"
2084,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Like incense, arose from the spot,"
2085,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"It would crowd from my heart some pain gnawing there,"
2086,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,While the world with its cares was forgot.
2087,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2088,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Here, I've heard the first news of the blue bird and dove,"
2089,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"And the round, silver note of the thrush,"
2090,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"A concert, with sweet variations of love,"
2091,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,Seemed pouring from tree and from bush.
2092,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2093,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,I walked there to-day; as an accent profane
2094,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"That falls on the heart and the ear,"
2095,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"I heard the harsh echo of hammer and plane,"
2096,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,And the pant of a mill in the rear.
2097,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2098,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,So I muffled my face with the veil that I wore--
2099,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Time, that moment of pain can't appease;"
2100,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"Unless like the birds from the scene I can soar,"
2101,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,"And like them, forget the old trees."
2102,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2103,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2104,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2105,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,
2106,TO MY BROTHER--D. G. SLAUGHTER.,On the Hill-top Grow the Daisies.

2108,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,TO CARRIE ROGERS.
2109,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,
2110,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,
2111,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,I chanced to stroll not long ago
2112,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,To a green valley that you know;
2113,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,For everything about the town
2114,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"Was strange, and on me seemed to frown,"
2115,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"And so I wandered off alone,"
2116,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,To seek the friends from youth I'd known.
2117,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"The brook came dashing down the hill,"
2118,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,The same old song to hum and trill;
2119,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"With glances shy and kisses sweet,"
2120,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"It wound its ribbon at my feet,"
2121,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,And laughed aloud at my delight--
2122,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,It was indeed a comic sight
2123,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"To see me o'er the brooklet bend,"
2124,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,And greet again an old time friend.
2125,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,
2126,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"So thus I sat, perhaps an hour,"
2127,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,Until I spied a human flower;
2128,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,A little maid it seemed to be
2129,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,With steps directed straight to me.
2130,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"Her dress was pink, her bonnet white."
2131,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"Her eyes were blue, and round, and bright,"
2132,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,Some daisies in her hand she held
2133,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,But where they came from--would she tell?
2134,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"Were questions that my eyes portrayed,"
2135,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,And she the answer quickly made.
2136,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"""Upon the hill-top high they grow,"
2137,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"The path is there by which you go,"
2138,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"But if you get them you must climb,"""
2139,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"She said, unconscious of the rhyme."
2140,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,
2141,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,I glanced along the rocky ledge;
2142,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"The daisies nodded o'er the edge,"
2143,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,And just as far as I could see
2144,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,They waved their ruffled caps to me.
2145,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,Bright eyes that never had grown old
2146,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"Their heart's content to me foretold,"
2147,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,And I resolved the path to try
2148,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,That seemed to end so near the sky;
2149,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"And so I started up alone,"
2150,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,A way that seemed with mosses sown.
2151,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"A pond'rous clod rolled on the track,"
2152,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"A briar reached and pulled me back,"
2153,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"A lizzard on the pathway played,"
2154,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,And half way up I paused--afraid.
2155,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,
2156,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"""Keep on,"" the little girl replied,"
2157,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"""A better path is near your side."""
2158,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"She pulled the thorn from off my gown,"
2159,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"I heard the clod go plunging down,"
2160,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"And then she clasped with mine her hand,"
2161,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"And led me up to ""daisy-land."""
2162,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,The hours we spent together there
2163,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"Were hallowed as the hours of prayer,"
2164,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,And when she left me in the vale
2165,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,The sunlight suddenly grew pale;
2166,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"But she had taught me this strange truth,"
2167,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"Forgot, or never learned in youth,"
2168,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"It seems a little song in rhyme,"
2169,TO CARRIE ROGERS.,"""To reach the daisies, you must climb."""

2456,TO MISS F. B.,That bordered my restless dream.
2457,TO MISS F. B.,
2458,TO MISS F. B.,"So I hid this heart in a lily,"
2459,TO MISS F. B.,When the dawn began to break--
2460,TO MISS F. B.,"In a beautiful water lily,"

2463,TO MISS F. B.,"Yes, down on a snowy pillow,"

2482,TO MISS F. B.,

2707,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","Vainly proved every art,"

2710,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","Many times I go into this quaint little room,"
2711,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",The pictures to change or adjust;
2712,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","I see your sweet faces grouped there with my own,"
2713,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",And I wonder that I feel so strangely alone;

2760,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",One held a zithern in her hand
2761,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",And lightly swept the throbbing strings;
2762,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","And, O! it seemed a fairy land"

2773,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",
2774,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","All blooming in immortal dyes,"

2782,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",
2783,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",The scratching of a pen I heard
2784,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",And saw a face demure and sweet

2786,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",I begged the angel to repeat.
2787,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","A thousand zephyrs fanned the air,"
2788,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","Tuned low with hum of birds and bees,"

2813,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",Fragile did I say? So fragile that the lace-wrought butterfly

2815,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",
2816,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","Yet perplexed as to its mission down the pathway I retreat,"

2819,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","Why should I evade its coming, when 'tis such a little thing?"
2820,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",Just a tiny recollection that my thoughts have given wing.
2821,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",
2822,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","Soon, too soon, 'twill overtake me, see! 'tis gaining on me fast--"

2841,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",
2842,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","If he steal from your side when the twilight descends,"

2862,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","You may ask if you choose as he moves through the dance,"

2866,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",
2867,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.",Should he turn from the ball-room sometime with disgust
2868,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","And shake from his sandals its memory and dust,"
2869,"TO LIZZIE, DORA, AND GRACE.","To bare a sick heart with its fevers of sin,"

2988,TO F. S. H.,"Floating down the sunset's tide,"
2989,TO F. S. H.,"Where there is no sign of sail,"
2990,TO F. S. H.,Neither any promised gale.
2991,TO F. S. H.,"Flames about on every side,"
2992,TO F. S. H.,Every hope from me denied.
2993,TO F. S. H.,Even the clouds I can not hail;
2994,TO F. S. H.,"As they drift,"
2995,TO F. S. H.,Their cinders sift
2996,TO F. S. H.,"On the water where they float,"
2997,TO F. S. H.,"Like a freighted, burning boat."
2998,TO F. S. H.,
2999,TO F. S. H.,"Oh! the sweet, yet lonesome journey"
3000,TO F. S. H.,That I always take alone!
3001,TO F. S. H.,"Back into the vanished past,"
3002,TO F. S. H.,Where the sunshine runneth fast.
3003,TO F. S. H.,"There the rose is open blown,"
3004,TO F. S. H.,"There I hear a loving tone,"
3005,TO F. S. H.,There no twilight shades are cast;
3006,TO F. S. H.,But complete
3007,TO F. S. H.,And very sweet
3008,TO F. S. H.,"Is the dawn, when, like a child,"
3009,TO F. S. H.,Love looked in my heart and smiled.
3010,TO F. S. H.,
3011,TO F. S. H.,"Oh! the happy, happy journey,"
3012,TO F. S. H.,With my loved one near my side!
3013,TO F. S. H.,Open stands the prison room;
3014,TO F. S. H.,We forget its chilly tomb.
3015,TO F. S. H.,"Over fields of grain we glide,"
3016,TO F. S. H.,"Over rivers broad we ride,"
3017,TO F. S. H.,Drinking up the earth's perfume;
3018,TO F. S. H.,Like a thought
3019,TO F. S. H.,The muses taught--
3020,TO F. S. H.,"Onward o'er the world we fly,"
3021,TO F. S. H.,Like twin clouds born of the sky.
3022,TO F. S. H.,
3023,TO F. S. H.,"Oh! the swift, inspiring journey,"
3024,TO F. S. H.,Far away in unknown space!
3025,TO F. S. H.,"Where my castles stand complete,"
3026,TO F. S. H.,And the gardens full and sweet;
3027,TO F. S. H.,"Where the moonlight weaves its lace,"
3028,TO F. S. H.,"And a friend's is every face,"
3029,TO F. S. H.,"And this land, need I repeat,"
3030,TO F. S. H.,Is of dreams?
3031,TO F. S. H.,Here crystal streams
3032,TO F. S. H.,"Lose their way, as from the throne,"
3033,TO F. S. H.,In this country all my own.
3034,TO F. S. H.,
3035,TO F. S. H.,Oh! the elevating journey!
3036,TO F. S. H.,"Toward the zenith now I bend,"
3037,TO F. S. H.,"Far above the mundane sphere,"
3038,TO F. S. H.,Stars like mighty worlds appear.
3039,TO F. S. H.,"Losing sight of home and friends,"
3040,TO F. S. H.,Higher still the path ascends.
3041,TO F. S. H.,Heaven is dawning very near;
3042,TO F. S. H.,"But I pause,"
3043,TO F. S. H.,Alas! because
3044,TO F. S. H.,"To a mortal such as I,"
3045,TO F. S. H.,Heaven an entrance must deny.
3046,TO F. S. H.,
3047,TO F. S. H.,
3048,TO F. S. H.,
3049,TO F. S. H.,
3050,TO F. S. H.,The Lost Poem.
3051,TO F. S. H.,
3052,TO F. S. H.,
3053,TO F. S. H.,"Long ago beside my window, with an open manuscript,"
3054,TO F. S. H.,"I sat looking on a forest that with gold and brown was tipped,"
3055,TO F. S. H.,"Heeding nothing save the sighing of my own heart and the trees,"
3056,TO F. S. H.,When into the open lattice like a whisper came the breeze.
3057,TO F. S. H.,
3058,TO F. S. H.,"Lingered at my lips a moment, past my temple then it crept,"
3059,TO F. S. H.,And from out of my listless fingers an unfinished poem swept:
3060,TO F. S. H.,"""Stop!"" I cried unto a footman that was passing on the street,"
3061,TO F. S. H.,"""I will give you thirty shillings if you'll bring me back that"
3062,TO F. S. H.,"sheet."""
3063,TO F. S. H.,
3064,TO F. S. H.,"But he gazed into the heavens as he would upon a kite,"
3065,TO F. S. H.,"And I watched it sally upward, fading faster from my sight;"
3066,TO F. S. H.,"Then I said unto a swallow that flew by on rapid wing,"
3067,TO F. S. H.,"""Open wide I'll throw the granary if my poem back you'll bring."""
3068,TO F. S. H.,
3069,TO F. S. H.,"But he only flew the faster, and was soon beyond my sight;"
3070,TO F. S. H.,"And the daylight vanished from me, and to mock me sent the night."
3071,TO F. S. H.,"O! there's naught can daunt a spirit when the inner heart's afire,"
3072,TO F. S. H.,And the darkness sent upon me only did my aim inspire.
3073,TO F. S. H.,
3074,TO F. S. H.,"So I sought an humble dwelling, to a fortune-teller went,"
3075,TO F. S. H.,"And I tarried with the gipsy till the night was almost spent,"
3076,TO F. S. H.,But I left her door disheartened; for she only said to me:
3077,TO F. S. H.,"""Take this, search, and when you've found it, send or fetch again"
3078,TO F. S. H.,"the key."""
3079,TO F. S. H.,
3080,TO F. S. H.,"""But,"" said I, ""'tis lost in nature, in the sky or hills among,"""
3081,TO F. S. H.,And the key back in her shanty with an angry word I flung;
3082,TO F. S. H.,"For prophetic seemed her language, and my purposes were mocked,"
3083,TO F. S. H.,"If henceforth the heart of nature, Fate against my own had locked."
3084,TO F. S. H.,
3085,TO F. S. H.,"""Take it, search,"" again she muttered, as I started to depart;"
3086,TO F. S. H.,"""And be careful how you use it; for it fits the human heart."""
3087,TO F. S. H.,"In her hand I dropped a coin, and before the eye of day"
3088,TO F. S. H.,Peeped from out the morning's cradle I was far upon my way.
3089,TO F. S. H.,
3090,TO F. S. H.,"Like the breath of early roses, like the whisper of a bird,"
3091,TO F. S. H.,"From a little maiden passing, a sweet laugh methought I heard."
3092,TO F. S. H.,"""She has found it,"" I repeated, ""there's no use for any key."""
3093,TO F. S. H.,"Said the pretty little damsel, ""My heart's open, don't you see?"""
3094,TO F. S. H.,
3095,TO F. S. H.,"Yes, I saw, and there were treasures such as kings would love to"
3096,TO F. S. H.,"own,"
3097,TO F. S. H.,Who would sacrifice to gain them e'en a jeweled crown and throne--
3098,TO F. S. H.,"Buds and blossoms, song and laughter, humming-birds and butterflies,"
3099,TO F. S. H.,"Singing brooks and sparkling fountains there, and peaceful were the"
3100,TO F. S. H.,skies.
3101,TO F. S. H.,
3102,TO F. S. H.,"But the poem it was missing; so I journeyed slow along,"
3103,TO F. S. H.,Till I heard a mother singing to her babe a cradle song;
3104,TO F. S. H.,"And I tried to get permission in her heart to fit the key,"
3105,TO F. S. H.,"But the lullaby continued: ""Do not interrupt,"" said she."
3106,TO F. S. H.,
3107,TO F. S. H.,"Next I hailed a youth that passed me, and his face was wond'rous"
3108,TO F. S. H.,"fair,"
3109,TO F. S. H.,"And I searched long through his heart's book, but the poem was not"
3110,TO F. S. H.,there;
3111,TO F. S. H.,"""It is lost!"" I cried with sorrow, as Despair held out her cup,"
3112,TO F. S. H.,"And I quaffed the bitter liquid, and the idle search gave up."
3113,TO F. S. H.,
3114,TO F. S. H.,*       *       *       *       *
3115,TO F. S. H.,
3116,TO F. S. H.,"Years have passed, and just this morning I was called beside a bed,"
3117,TO F. S. H.,Where the sheet lay still and sober over an old lover spread;
3118,TO F. S. H.,"Sad and pallid were his features, clever, too, Death's new disguise,"
3119,TO F. S. H.,"But I read the old, old secret, even in his half-closed eyes."
3120,TO F. S. H.,
3121,TO F. S. H.,"Then a thought--""The key,"" I whispered, lest I should be overheard,"
3122,TO F. S. H.,"And I sought the heart, unlocked it; found my poem--every word."
3123,TO F. S. H.,"Oft revised it was, and polished, wore the features, too, of Fame;"
3124,TO F. S. H.,"And I read with strange emotion, just below inscribed my name."
3125,TO F. S. H.,
3126,TO F. S. H.,"O, it was a trying moment! If the poem I should claim,"
3127,TO F. S. H.,I could mount upon the ladder to the topmost round of fame;
3128,TO F. S. H.,"But my evil spirit yielded; for I could not rob the dead,"
3129,TO F. S. H.,"So I locked the sacred prison, and above it bowed my head."
3130,TO F. S. H.,
3131,TO F. S. H.,*       *       *       *       *
3132,TO F. S. H.,
3133,TO F. S. H.,"Rather would I find engraven in a steadfast heart my name,"
3134,TO F. S. H.,Than in shining words enroll it high upon the tower of fame.
3135,TO F. S. H.,
3136,TO F. S. H.,
3137,TO F. S. H.,
3138,TO F. S. H.,
3139,TO F. S. H.,A Maple Leaf.
3140,TO F. S. H.,
3141,TO M. B. S.,TO M. B. S.
3142,TO M. B. S.,
3143,TO M. B. S.,
3144,TO M. B. S.,Glancing o'er a childish volume where sweet thoughts like blossoms
3145,TO M. B. S.,"lay,"
3146,TO M. B. S.,"There between two oft read pages, a pressed wreath I found to-day."
3147,TO M. B. S.,"Golden-rod and aster flowers lay with bloom all crushed and dead,"
3148,TO M. B. S.,But a maple leaf among them still retained its gold and red.
3149,TO M. B. S.,
3150,TO M. B. S.,"In my hand I took the treasure, held it up before my face,"
3151,TO M. B. S.,"And the sunlight, then declining, solved its geometric grace."
3152,TO M. B. S.,Many a road and by-path meeting proved the interwoven veins;
3153,TO M. B. S.,"And a forest rose before me, flaming like my window panes."
3154,TO M. B. S.,
3155,TO M. B. S.,"As a vision that is pictured by an angel in the night,"
3156,TO M. B. S.,"Soon a figure, sometime vanished, rose to my exultant sight."
3157,TO M. B. S.,"Like a goddess of enchantment, there she stood beneath the trees,"
3158,TO M. B. S.,"And her face was like a lily, and her eyes like summer seas."
3159,TO M. B. S.,
3160,TO M. B. S.,"Then I thought, ""For me she's waiting""--so I glanced off to the"
3161,TO M. B. S.,"right,"
3162,TO M. B. S.,"For I feared it all a fancy, but I found my home in sight;"
3163,TO M. B. S.,"Heard the town-clock slowly striking, and the same familiar bells,"
3164,TO M. B. S.,"Saw the court-house and the churches, and ""The Summit,"" where she"
3165,TO M. B. S.,dwells.
3166,TO M. B. S.,
3167,TO M. B. S.,"So I then no longer doubted, down a meadow path I strolled,"
3168,TO M. B. S.,Leading off into the woodland that had stole the sunset's gold.
3169,TO M. B. S.,"Overhead the birds were flying, but a black winged happy throng"
3170,TO M. B. S.,Paused; for we had been old comrades and they sang a farewell song.
3171,TO M. B. S.,
3172,TO M. B. S.,"But the thoughts that followed after, though the birds away had"
3173,TO M. B. S.,"flown,"
3174,TO M. B. S.,"Were so happy, for she met me, linked her arm within my own."
3175,TO M. B. S.,"Up and down the path we wandered, gathering leaves and grasses"
3176,TO M. B. S.,"gray,"
3177,TO M. B. S.,Until darkness drove the twilight o'er the hill where fled the day.
3178,TO M. B. S.,
3179,TO M. B. S.,"Darkness! and her face had vanished, all alone I seemed to stand,"
3180,TO M. B. S.,"But I heard her step departing, and I grasped again her hand."
3181,TO M. B. S.,"Held it tight, and tighter pressing, in a happy strange belief,"
3182,TO M. B. S.,"Till I 'woke, and found that dreaming I had crushed my treasured"
3183,TO M. B. S.,leaf.
3184,TO M. B. S.,
3185,TO M. B. S.,
3186,TO M. B. S.,
3187,TO M. B. S.,
3188,TO M. B. S.,A Gallop With Santa Claus.
3189,TO M. B. S.,
3190,TO M. B. S.,
3191,TO M. B. S.,I was thinking last night of the children
3192,TO M. B. S.,"Far away in a home that I know,"
3193,TO M. B. S.,"Of the dear little girls at the window,"
3194,TO M. B. S.,And the boys out at play in the snow;
3195,TO M. B. S.,"Of the stockings hung up at the chimney,"
3196,TO M. B. S.,Of the little hearts hopeful and glad;
3197,TO M. B. S.,"And thus I kept thinking and thinking,"
3198,TO M. B. S.,Until I grew homesick and sad.
3199,TO M. B. S.,
3200,TO M. B. S.,"So I turned my eyes out on the landscape,"
3201,TO M. B. S.,"As my thoughts were unwilling to go,"
3202,TO M. B. S.,And I saw 'round the curve of a hillock
3203,TO M. B. S.,"Three ponies come, white as the snow;"
3204,TO M. B. S.,"A sleigh next appeared and a driver,"
3205,TO M. B. S.,"Oh! my heart beat so fast then--because,"
3206,TO M. B. S.,"As he drew up the reins at the door-step,"
3207,TO M. B. S.,I found it was old Santa Claus.
3208,TO M. B. S.,
3209,TO M. B. S.,Such shaking of hands and such greetings
3210,TO M. B. S.,I fear I shall nevermore see;
3211,TO M. B. S.,For every big doll in his wagon
3212,TO M. B. S.,Was looking and laughing at me.
3213,TO M. B. S.,"""No minutes to lose,"" said old Santa,"
3214,TO M. B. S.,"""I've hundreds of miles yet to go."
3215,TO M. B. S.,"Will you please to partake of my journey,"
3216,TO M. B. S.,"And gallop with me o'er the snow?"""
3217,TO M. B. S.,
3218,TO M. B. S.,"No sooner than said I was seated,"
3219,TO M. B. S.,All 'round me he folded the fur.
3220,TO M. B. S.,"He made a loose rein for the ponies,"
3221,TO M. B. S.,And urged them with whip and with spur.
3222,TO M. B. S.,Away and away o'er the country
3223,TO M. B. S.,"We flew like the glances of light,"
3224,TO M. B. S.,"Down streets that were blazing with bonfires,"
3225,TO M. B. S.,"On, on through the snow and the night."
3226,TO M. B. S.,
3227,TO M. B. S.,Then all of a sudden he halted
3228,TO M. B. S.,In front of a house old and dark.
3229,TO M. B. S.,"There was no friendly ray at the window,"
3230,TO M. B. S.,And on the hearth-stone not a spark.
3231,TO M. B. S.,"But he entered, and, by a dim lantern"
3232,TO M. B. S.,"That swung from his new scarlet cap,"
3233,TO M. B. S.,I saw the sad face of a woman
3234,TO M. B. S.,"Asleep, and a babe on her lap."
3235,TO M. B. S.,
3236,TO M. B. S.,"And two pretty faces beside her,"
3237,TO M. B. S.,"A pillow of straw almost hid,"
3238,TO M. B. S.,But the little hands looked as if frozen
3239,TO M. B. S.,That lay on the patched cover-lid.
3240,TO M. B. S.,"A snow-cloud had sifted its samples,"
3241,TO M. B. S.,"Of eider-down over their feet,"
3242,TO M. B. S.,"And a star, looking in through the shingles,"
3243,TO M. B. S.,Was spreading o'er them a bright sheet.
3244,TO M. B. S.,
3245,TO M. B. S.,Old Santa had lost not a moment.
3246,TO M. B. S.,A cedar tree suddenly sprung
3247,TO M. B. S.,"Into life just in front of the children,"
3248,TO M. B. S.,With pop-corn and bright ribbons strung.
3249,TO M. B. S.,"Some tiny wax candles were lighted,"
3250,TO M. B. S.,To chase off the thoughts of the night;
3251,TO M. B. S.,And the dollies had met in the tree-top
3252,TO M. B. S.,To dance in their dresses of white.
3253,TO M. B. S.,
3254,TO M. B. S.,A kite that could climb into cloud-land
3255,TO M. B. S.,"Hung low, and a new picture-book;"
3256,TO M. B. S.,"A street-car ""wound up"" for its journey,"
3257,TO M. B. S.,And a little boat built for the brook.
3258,TO M. B. S.,Oh! all kinds of candy he left them
3259,TO M. B. S.,"That ever I tasted, or you;"
3260,TO M. B. S.,And under the tree there were apples
3261,TO M. B. S.,And peanuts--a bucket or two.
3262,TO M. B. S.,
3263,TO M. B. S.,"He built them a fire, and dresses"
3264,TO M. B. S.,"Were left, made of flannel so warm;"
3265,TO M. B. S.,"And, with many nice greetings and wishes,"
3266,TO M. B. S.,We galloped away through the storm.
3267,TO M. B. S.,"Away, and away sped the ponies,"
3268,TO M. B. S.,So fast that none could o'ertake--
3269,TO M. B. S.,"So fast (it was told me this morning),"
3270,TO M. B. S.,We looked like a winged snow-flake.
3271,TO M. B. S.,
3272,TO M. B. S.,"But soon at a homestead we halted,"
3273,TO M. B. S.,"Old Santa said I must alight,"
3274,TO M. B. S.,"To see if the children were sleeping,"
3275,TO M. B. S.,And leave them whatever was right.
3276,TO M. B. S.,"So I crept to the casement--it opened,"
3277,TO M. B. S.,And I saw what I ne'er shall forget--
3278,TO M. B. S.,"Those darlings there slumbering sweetly,"
3279,TO M. B. S.,The thoughts of the night-fall had met.
3280,TO M. B. S.,
3281,TO M. B. S.,"We gave them all kinds of nice presents,"
3282,TO M. B. S.,"What they were, it is useless to say;"
3283,TO M. B. S.,"For they've found them and now are rejoicing,"
3284,TO M. B. S.,And happy this glad holiday.
3285,TO M. B. S.,"So children, be kind to each other,"
3286,TO M. B. S.,Be gentle and loving--because
3287,TO M. B. S.,I may be invited next Christmas
3288,TO M. B. S.,To gallop with old Santa Claus.

3294,TO M. B. S.,
3295,TO M. B. S.,
3296,TO M. B. S.,I am thinking of a cottage
3297,TO M. B. S.,"Where the roses used to bloom,"
3298,TO M. B. S.,How they talked beside the pavement
3299,TO M. B. S.,"In low whispers of perfume,"
3300,TO M. B. S.,Or climbed up beside the window
3301,TO M. B. S.,To look in my little room.
3302,TO M. B. S.,
3303,TO M. B. S.,I am thinking of the door-way
3304,TO M. B. S.,"Where the vine I used to train,"
3305,TO M. B. S.,That snowed down its flaky petals
3306,TO M. B. S.,With a pleasant summer rain;
3307,TO M. B. S.,Where I used to sit and listen
3308,TO M. B. S.,To the old mill's low refrain.
3309,TO M. B. S.,
3310,TO M. B. S.,"I'm thinking of the sunflower, too,"
3311,TO M. B. S.,That towered above the gate;
3312,TO M. B. S.,Of the friends who called me hither
3313,TO M. B. S.,When the day was cool and late.
3314,TO M. B. S.,Ah! those hours seem so distant
3315,TO M. B. S.,"And the year, an ancient date."
3316,TO M. B. S.,
3317,TO M. B. S.,I am thinking of the grape-vine
3318,TO M. B. S.,"Where the crippled robin fed,"
3319,TO M. B. S.,How he lingered there each morning
3320,TO M. B. S.,'Till fresh crumbs for him were spread.
3321,TO M. B. S.,Is he feeding there this summer
3322,TO M. B. S.,"From a stranger's hand, instead?"
3323,TO M. B. S.,
3324,TO M. B. S.,I am thinking of the children
3325,TO M. B. S.,"Who crept to the little yard,"
3326,TO M. B. S.,Begging me to grant permission
3327,TO M. B. S.,That they play upon the sward.
3328,TO M. B. S.,Could I bar them from the entry?
3329,TO M. B. S.,Thus might Heaven me discard.
3330,TO M. B. S.,
3331,TO M. B. S.,I am thinking of a morning
3332,TO M. B. S.,"That wrung from my heart a sigh,"
3333,TO M. B. S.,"When I kissed warm lips that trembled,"
3334,TO M. B. S.,With a tear-drop in my eye;
3335,TO M. B. S.,While I closed our cottage windows
3336,TO M. B. S.,And pronounced the word--good-bye.

3344,TO M. B. S.,"I passed a pretty cottage place,"
3345,TO M. B. S.,A rose looked from the door
3346,TO M. B. S.,And smiled so sweetly in my face
3347,TO M. B. S.,I paused the house before.
3348,TO M. B. S.,The honeysuckle from the wall
3349,TO M. B. S.,"Threw down a welcome tear,"
3350,TO M. B. S.,The breeze came rushing through the hall
3351,TO M. B. S.,"And whispered, ""Tarry here,"
3352,TO M. B. S.,
3353,TO M. B. S.,"""For all within is peace and love;"""
3354,TO M. B. S.,So through the curtain's lace
3355,TO M. B. S.,"I glanced the reckless words to prove,"
3356,TO M. B. S.,And saw a lover's face
3357,TO M. B. S.,Bent close above two eyes of blue.
3358,TO M. B. S.,Why should I dim their day?
3359,TO M. B. S.,"Across the pane the blind I drew,"
3360,TO M. B. S.,And softly crept away.
3361,TO M. B. S.,
3362,TO M. B. S.,"I went again, one summer eve;"
3363,TO M. B. S.,The rose blushed at the door
3364,TO M. B. S.,But smiled as sweetly to receive
3365,TO M. B. S.,Me as it did before;
3366,TO M. B. S.,"The breeze came out as joyously,"
3367,TO M. B. S.,"And lingered at my side,"
3368,TO M. B. S.,"And murmured: ""Tarry now and see"
3369,TO M. B. S.,"Our happy groom and bride."""
3370,TO M. B. S.,
3371,TO M. B. S.,"""O, no!"" I said, ""some other day"
3372,TO M. B. S.,"I'll call the pair to see."""
3373,TO M. B. S.,But as I turned to go away
3374,TO M. B. S.,They both looked out at me.
3375,TO M. B. S.,O! what a light of hope and love
3376,TO M. B. S.,Their features then o'erspread;
3377,TO M. B. S.,And a shekinah from above
3378,TO M. B. S.,Seemed on the cottage shed.
3379,TO M. B. S.,
3380,TO M. B. S.,Years crept away. When next I came
3381,TO M. B. S.,"Before that open door,"
3382,TO M. B. S.,A little child pronounced my name
3383,TO M. B. S.,That golden tresses wore.
3384,TO M. B. S.,"""Will you come in?"" she gladly cried,"
3385,TO M. B. S.,And opened wide the gate.
3386,TO M. B. S.,"""My little one,"" I slow replied,"
3387,TO M. B. S.,"""The day is low and late."
3388,TO M. B. S.,
3389,TO M. B. S.,"""To-morrow when the sun is bright,"
3390,TO M. B. S.,I'll come and play with you;
3391,TO M. B. S.,"Too chilly now, the falling night,"
3392,TO M. B. S.,"Too damp the evening dew."""
3393,TO M. B. S.,And so I did. I often trod
3394,TO M. B. S.,Along the side yard there;
3395,TO M. B. S.,"And found that fresher grew the sod,"
3396,TO M. B. S.,The sky more bright and fair.
3397,TO M. B. S.,
3398,TO M. B. S.,I once had said that every rose
3399,TO M. B. S.,"Held just a briar or two,"
3400,TO M. B. S.,And every river as it flows
3401,TO M. B. S.,A dark wave with the blue;
3402,TO M. B. S.,"But 'twas not thus I found it here,"
3403,TO M. B. S.,The world that night I'd tell
3404,TO M. B. S.,That I had found a sky so clear
3405,TO M. B. S.,That rain drops never fell.
3406,TO M. B. S.,
3407,TO M. B. S.,Thus musing on that sweet child's face
3408,TO M. B. S.,"That night I could not sleep,"
3409,TO M. B. S.,A shadow seemed the light to chase
3410,TO M. B. S.,As storms the ocean sweep;
3411,TO M. B. S.,And when the stars forsook the sky
3412,TO M. B. S.,And birds their matins sang
3413,TO M. B. S.,I strolled again the cottage by
3414,TO M. B. S.,And loud the door-bell rang.
3415,TO M. B. S.,
3416,TO M. B. S.,"The rose had dropped its leaves and died,"
3417,TO M. B. S.,I heard within a sob.
3418,TO M. B. S.,What did it mean? The winds replied
3419,TO M. B. S.,"""Crape hangs upon the knob."""
3420,TO M. B. S.,Softly I raised the window's lace--
3421,TO M. B. S.,The little child was dead--
3422,TO M. B. S.,"I threw a flower across her face,"
3423,TO M. B. S.,And from the cottage fled.
3424,TO M. B. S.,
3425,TO M. B. S.,I never will go back again
3426,TO M. B. S.,Or push the blinds apart--
3427,TO M. B. S.,"I sought a sunshine for my pen,"
3428,TO M. B. S.,Found shadows for my heart.
3429,TO M. B. S.,
3430,TO M. B. S.,
3431,TO M. B. S.,
3432,TO M. B. S.,
3433,TO M. B. S.,Only a Fern Leaf.

3439,TO H. M.,"Yellow and dry with age,"
3440,TO H. M.,Only a date recorded
3441,TO H. M.,Down at the ending page.
3442,TO H. M.,
3443,TO H. M.,"Only a breath from the mountain,"
3444,TO H. M.,A song with the summer wed;
3445,TO H. M.,"Only the voice of a fountain,"
3446,TO H. M.,Only a dream that is dead.
3447,TO H. M.,
3448,TO H. M.,"Only a faded morning,"
3449,TO H. M.,"With a shadow falling through,"
3450,TO H. M.,Only a hint of warning--
3451,TO H. M.,A cloud in the far off blue.
3452,TO H. M.,
3453,TO H. M.,Only a word of parting
3454,TO H. M.,Under a starlit sky;
3455,TO H. M.,"Only a tear that is starting,"
3456,TO H. M.,A long and a last good bye.
3457,TO H. M.,
3458,TO H. M.,Only a face of sorrow
3459,TO H. M.,Turned to a vanished year--
3460,TO H. M.,"Only a fern leaf, darling,"
3461,TO H. M.,Glued to the pages here.
3462,TO H. M.,
3463,TO H. M.,
3464,TO H. M.,
3465,TO H. M.,
3466,TO H. M.,A Dream.
3467,TO H. M.,
3468,TO MY FATHER.,TO MY FATHER.
3469,TO MY FATHER.,
3470,TO MY FATHER.,
3471,TO MY FATHER.,"Listen, father, while I tell you of a dream I had last night;"
3472,TO MY FATHER.,For it was so sweet my childhood home was painted in my sight.
3473,TO MY FATHER.,"'Twas the same old frame house, father, hidden by the same old"
3474,TO MY FATHER.,"trees,"
3475,TO MY FATHER.,"Apple, cherry, quince and locust, talking in the same old breeze."
3476,TO MY FATHER.,
3477,TO MY FATHER.,"On the walk I found the cowslip, stolen from ""The Old Ravine,"""
3478,TO MY FATHER.,"And the blue-bell, and the columbine--how near my heart they lean."
3479,TO MY FATHER.,"Roses, red as any furnace flame, about me seemed to grow."
3480,TO MY FATHER.,"Roses pink as maiden blushes, roses pure and white as snow."
3481,TO MY FATHER.,
3482,TO MY FATHER.,"All around the yard I wandered, oh! so long I can not tell,"
3483,TO MY FATHER.,Then I paused beneath the apple tree and drank from the old well.
3484,TO MY FATHER.,"Through my veins I felt the water coursing like a happy thought,"
3485,TO MY FATHER.,And a thousand recollections to my memory then it brought.
3486,TO MY FATHER.,
3487,TO MY FATHER.,"Recollections rushing to me swifter than an angel's wing,"
3488,TO MY FATHER.,Recollections slipping from me as a pearl slips from a string.
3489,TO MY FATHER.,"Recollections that transfigured me into a little child,"
3490,TO MY FATHER.,And the halo shed around me was my father's happy smile.
3491,TO MY FATHER.,
3492,TO MY FATHER.,"It was such a pretty picture Fancy held before my view,"
3493,TO MY FATHER.,"I will turn the magic lantern so that you may see it, too."
3494,TO MY FATHER.,"It is springtime and the sugar trees have pitched their shady tent,"
3495,TO MY FATHER.,Tiny leaves like tiny parasols reach toward the firmament.
3496,TO MY FATHER.,
3497,TO MY FATHER.,"Restless swings a childish figure to and fro upon the gate,"
3498,TO MY FATHER.,Some one's coming down the highway--'tis for him she there doth
3499,TO MY FATHER.,wait.
3500,TO MY FATHER.,"Ah! you recognize the picture, I can tell it by your smile;"
3501,TO MY FATHER.,"You have recognized the sugar trees, and recognized your child."
3502,TO MY FATHER.,
3503,TO MY FATHER.,"Through the pasture now we're strolling, looking down the avenue,"
3504,TO MY FATHER.,See you not another picture? Yes; the figures there are two.
3505,TO MY FATHER.,"Mother sits upon the portico her knitting in her hand,"
3506,TO MY FATHER.,And my brother talks beside her of that wild and Western land
3507,TO MY FATHER.,
3508,TO MY FATHER.,Where he raced his Indian ponies and lassoed the buffaloes
3509,TO MY FATHER.,"Oh, it is a perfect wonderland!--this country that he knows."
3510,TO MY FATHER.,But we will not interrupt them; for they do so happy seem--
3511,TO MY FATHER.,So we turn aside and leave them wandering on as in a dream.
3512,TO MY FATHER.,
3513,TO MY FATHER.,"Then I led you up the hillside and we sat upon the ""mound."""
3514,TO MY FATHER.,Oh! there never was before or since so pretty a view spread 'round.
3515,TO MY FATHER.,"Just below, the tranquil water of the clear pond seemed to win"
3516,TO MY FATHER.,"Every cloud that floated over, and the heavens lay within."
3517,TO MY FATHER.,
3518,TO MY FATHER.,"Then the meadow, where the clover bloomed, and where you stacked the"
3519,TO MY FATHER.,"hay,"
3520,TO MY FATHER.,"Like a field within a picture book, before us there it lay;"
3521,TO MY FATHER.,"Then beyond, the barn and orchard, and the valley that I love--"
3522,TO MY FATHER.,Oh! it all seemed like a painting let down by the Hand above.
3523,TO MY FATHER.,
3524,TO MY FATHER.,But a thought came rushing to me of a fairy that you know;
3525,TO MY FATHER.,For she lived there in the valley and her name it was Echo.
3526,TO MY FATHER.,"So I laughed and called unto her just as loud as I could call,"
3527,TO MY FATHER.,But the voice that she threw back to me was not a child's at all.
3528,TO MY FATHER.,
3529,TO MY FATHER.,"No; it was a woman's voice; I awoke then with a start,"
3530,TO MY FATHER.,And I found the king beside me that dethroned you in my heart.
3531,TO MY FATHER.,"Then a tear fell on the pillow, not a briny, bitter tear,"
3532,TO MY FATHER.,Why? you ask--because the dream was gone that I have copied here.
3533,TO MY FATHER.,
3534,TO MY FATHER.,
3535,TO MY FATHER.,
3536,TO MY FATHER.,
3537,TO MY FATHER.,Those Soft Airs She Played.
3538,TO MY FATHER.,
3539,TO M. B. S.,TO M. B. S.
3540,TO M. B. S.,
3541,TO M. B. S.,
3542,TO M. B. S.,Those soft airs she played--through my mem'ry they glide
3543,TO M. B. S.,Like a cloud-shadow crossing the plain;
3544,TO M. B. S.,"The sun follows often, the wind at his side,"
3545,TO M. B. S.,"Then a whisper that never the roses denied,"
3546,TO M. B. S.,And a sound like a light fall of rain.
3547,TO M. B. S.,
3548,TO M. B. S.,"Grander music she plays--music weird and sublime,"
3549,TO M. B. S.,"Thunder toned, like the sound of the sea,"
3550,TO M. B. S.,That rolleth away like the surges of time;
3551,TO M. B. S.,"But, to quicken my thoughts and to sweeten my rhyme,"
3552,TO M. B. S.,She always played soft airs for me.
3553,TO M. B. S.,
3554,TO M. B. S.,"Faint whispers that blend with the deep forest's sound,"
3555,TO M. B. S.,"From which a wild fawn would not flee,"
3556,TO M. B. S.,"And sweet as the brook that the summer has found,"
3557,TO M. B. S.,"When singing its song soft and glad underground,"
3558,TO M. B. S.,And carrying its heart to the sea....
3559,TO M. B. S.,
3560,TO M. B. S.,A movement then mingles like those that are heard
3561,TO M. B. S.,When the trees toss their shade to the eaves;
3562,TO M. B. S.,"A pause and a tremble, as of a sweet word,"
3563,TO M. B. S.,Or the dream-haunted wing of a night-hidden bird
3564,TO M. B. S.,That is shaking the dew from the leaves.
3565,TO M. B. S.,
3566,TO M. B. S.,"Then silence, that even a word would profane--"
3567,TO M. B. S.,"Silence, holding some thoughts heaven-born,"
3568,TO M. B. S.,That only her fingers a moment can chain;
3569,TO M. B. S.,"Up, up to the skies they have wandered again,"
3570,TO M. B. S.,Like a prayer holy spoken at morn.
3571,TO M. B. S.,
3572,TO M. B. S.,"Those soft airs she played in the dim lighted room,"
3573,TO M. B. S.,With her heart in the past far away--
3574,TO M. B. S.,"Ah, what would I give if to-night, through the gloom,"
3575,TO M. B. S.,"Along with the budding and bursting of bloom,"
3576,TO M. B. S.,They now past my window would stray.
3577,TO M. B. S.,
3578,TO M. B. S.,"Alas! vain the thought, and as vain sounds the sigh,"
3579,TO M. B. S.,Long distance my wish has delayed;
3580,TO M. B. S.,But we sit in the twilight--my mem'ry and I--
3581,TO M. B. S.,"And listen and linger, we scarcely know why,"
3582,TO M. B. S.,Unless for those soft airs she played.
3583,TO M. B. S.,
3584,TO M. B. S.,
3585,TO M. B. S.,

3589,TO M. B. S.,
3590,TO M. B. S.,"Thou art going from us, Albert,"
3591,TO M. B. S.,"Going far away from me,"
3592,TO M. B. S.,"Where I can not hear thy prattle,"
3593,TO M. B. S.,And thy face I can not see.
3594,TO M. B. S.,
3595,TO M. B. S.,"Back into the Southern country,"
3596,TO M. B. S.,"Thou art going--there to roam,"
3597,TO M. B. S.,Where my heart began its singing--
3598,TO M. B. S.,In the old Kentucky home.
3599,TO M. B. S.,
3600,TO M. B. S.,"Lonely all the days will linger,"
3601,TO M. B. S.,When I miss your little face;
3602,TO M. B. S.,"Shadows gray, from out the hours,"
3603,TO M. B. S.,All the sunbeams soon will chase.
3604,TO M. B. S.,
3605,TO M. B. S.,"Dim will seem the sunny window,"
3606,TO M. B. S.,"Where the pansy blossom grows,"
3607,TO M. B. S.,And no restless little fingers
3608,TO M. B. S.,Will disturb the opening rose.
3609,TO M. B. S.,
3610,TO M. B. S.,"Soon the playthings will be missing,"
3611,TO M. B. S.,Soon they gathered up must be--
3612,TO M. B. S.,"Thou art going from us, Albert,"
3613,TO M. B. S.,Going far away from me.
3614,TO M. B. S.,
3615,TO M. B. S.,"Soon the little boy that vexed me,"
3616,TO M. B. S.,"When I tried to read and write,"
3617,TO M. B. S.,Will be gone. No one will listen
3618,TO M. B. S.,When I sing my songs at night.
3619,TO M. B. S.,
3620,TO M. B. S.,"Soon the halls will lose their echo,"
3621,TO M. B. S.,"And the yard grow silent, too,"
3622,TO M. B. S.,"And the pretty face will vanish,"
3623,TO M. B. S.,With those wondrous eyes of blue.
3624,TO M. B. S.,
3625,TO M. B. S.,"So good-bye, my little darling;"
3626,TO M. B. S.,All these tears have been for thee--
3627,TO M. B. S.,"Thou art going from us, Albert,"
3628,TO M. B. S.,Going far away from me.

3656,TO M. B. S.,"A Rose in the richest satin,"
3657,TO M. B. S.,"With a bud to her bonnet tied,"

3733,TO M. B. S.,That beamed upon me through the night.
3734,TO M. B. S.,"The features were like mine, perchance,"
3735,TO M. B. S.,With part of heaven hid in the glance;
3736,TO M. B. S.,And the apparel that they wore
3737,TO M. B. S.,My fingers long had labored o'er.
3738,TO M. B. S.,
3739,TO M. B. S.,A vine ran through the tunic's hem
3740,TO M. B. S.,"That wilted not though broke the stem,"
3741,TO M. B. S.,And all the undergarments showed
3742,TO M. B. S.,The time and care on them bestowed.
3743,TO M. B. S.,Some of the moonbeams took a place
3744,TO M. B. S.,Within the frill about the face;
3745,TO M. B. S.,"And, stars that bright as Lyra glowed,"
3746,TO M. B. S.,The overdress and mantle showed.
3747,TO M. B. S.,
3748,TO M. B. S.,The sandals that encased the feet
3749,TO M. B. S.,"Were fashioned for a journey fleet,"
3750,TO M. B. S.,"And pinions, like a sail unfurled,"
3751,TO M. B. S.,"I saw outspread before the world,"
3752,TO M. B. S.,With promises to come again
3753,TO M. B. S.,And glorify the parent pen.
3754,TO M. B. S.,I tore apart the silken skein
3755,TO M. B. S.,And let them drift from out my brain.
3756,TO M. B. S.,
3757,TO M. B. S.,Where are they tarrying to-night?
3758,TO M. B. S.,"I see, around a fireside bright,"
3759,TO M. B. S.,One looking in a friendly face.
3760,TO M. B. S.,How tender seems the warm embrace!
3761,TO M. B. S.,"Now close, close to this loved one's lip"
3762,TO M. B. S.,"'Tis held, and for companionship"
3763,TO M. B. S.,"Is nestling down into the heart,"
3764,TO M. B. S.,And of the same becomes a part.
3765,TO M. B. S.,
3766,TO M. B. S.,"Some beckon me across the seas,"
3767,TO M. B. S.,"Are favored by a foreign breeze,"
3768,TO M. B. S.,"Are traveling where I can not go,"
3769,TO M. B. S.,"Are learning what I ne'er shall know,"
3770,TO M. B. S.,"Are praised, perhaps, with offered funds,"
3771,TO M. B. S.,While with them glad the newsboy runs;
3772,TO M. B. S.,"Are welcomed in some palace home,"
3773,TO M. B. S.,And ne'er allowed henceforth to roam.
3774,TO M. B. S.,
3775,TO M. B. S.,The one that I had loved the best
3776,TO M. B. S.,"A journey took into the West,"
3777,TO M. B. S.,And by a friend it chanced to meet
3778,TO M. B. S.,Sent home a prairie flower sweet.
3779,TO M. B. S.,"Two stronger ones, the North that sought,"
3780,TO M. B. S.,Some words of love back home have brought;
3781,TO M. B. S.,"They brighten up the lonesome hearth,"
3782,TO M. B. S.,And praise the pen that gave them birth.
3783,TO M. B. S.,
3784,TO M. B. S.,And one crept down in Cupid's coat
3785,TO M. B. S.,"To read a dainty perfumed note,"
3786,TO M. B. S.,And afterward came back to tell
3787,TO M. B. S.,How sweetly rang the wedding bell.
3788,TO M. B. S.,"Another, with as brave a face,"
3789,TO M. B. S.,Had with a rival run a race;
3790,TO M. B. S.,"It did its best, to gain had tried,"
3791,TO M. B. S.,"But came back home, alas! and died."
3792,TO M. B. S.,
3793,TO M. B. S.,"The tenderest one, perhaps, of all,"
3794,TO M. B. S.,Upon a critic chanced to call;
3795,TO M. B. S.,"He hooted at the homespun gown,"
3796,TO M. B. S.,"And bent his bitter, blackest frown"
3797,TO M. B. S.,"Upon the waif, and read its fate"
3798,TO M. B. S.,Where winter winds could congregate.
3799,TO M. B. S.,"I thought I heard its funeral bell,"
3800,TO M. B. S.,But where the grave is I'll not tell.
3801,TO M. B. S.,
3802,TO M. B. S.,"I do not know the others' fate,"
3803,TO M. B. S.,A pauper's grave may them await.
3804,TO M. B. S.,"The fabric that my hands embossed,"
3805,TO M. B. S.,"While Fancy figured high the cost,"
3806,TO M. B. S.,"May trail, to-night, some filthy street"
3807,TO M. B. S.,"Where sin and shame together meet,"
3808,TO M. B. S.,And the loved strains from my heart's lyre
3809,TO M. B. S.,Be sung around an outcast's fire.
3810,TO M. B. S.,
3811,TO M. B. S.,"They may attain a higher sphere,"
3812,TO M. B. S.,"Where flows the penitential tear,"
3813,TO M. B. S.,And point the wanderers they find
3814,TO M. B. S.,Upon the paths that heavenward wind.
3815,TO M. B. S.,God grant their mission may be such!
3816,TO M. B. S.,"That all sad hearts they'll lightly touch,"
3817,TO M. B. S.,And spread upon the ugly wound
3818,TO M. B. S.,A balm to make them whole and sound.
3819,TO M. B. S.,
3820,TO M. B. S.,
3821,TO M. B. S.,
3822,TO M. B. S.,
3823,TO M. B. S.,A Lily of the Valley.
3824,TO M. B. S.,
3825,TO M. B. S.,
3826,TO M. B. S.,Just a breath of fragrance
3827,TO M. B. S.,On the breeze--alas!
3828,TO M. B. S.,A lily of the valley
3829,TO M. B. S.,Dying in the grass.
3830,TO M. B. S.,
3831,TO M. B. S.,Just a recollection
3832,TO M. B. S.,Followed with a sigh;
3833,TO M. B. S.,Just a teardrop dripping
3834,TO M. B. S.,"Down the cheek, and why?"

3863,"MAY 16, 1887.",
3864,"MAY 16, 1887.",Thou hast been kind to me; no marble urn
3865,"MAY 16, 1887.","Chills the warm pulses of my heart to night,"
3866,"MAY 16, 1887.",And from the thought my pen doth gladly turn
3867,"MAY 16, 1887.",To offer homage ere you take your flight.

3869,"MAY 16, 1887.","Bright recollections thou hast left instead,"

3944,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","A cloud, in some soft raiment dressed,"
3945,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",Leaned like a bride upon the west;
3946,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",The sea-gulls floated on the breeze
3947,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",Like blossoms blown from April trees.
3948,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",
3949,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",The wind just kissed by summer's mouth
3950,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",Walked like a lover from the South;
3951,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",And jewels from a sunbeam's hand
3952,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",Were sprinkled on the snowy sand;
3953,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","The breakers ran along the beach,"
3954,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",And scattered shells within my reach.
3955,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",
3956,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","I stooped and held one to my ear,"
3957,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",And listened as to voices dear;
3958,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","And then methought far, far away,"
3959,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","Where purple mists made dim the day,"
3960,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",I saw the motion of a ship
3961,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",That from the heavens seemed to slip.
3962,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",
3963,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","On, on it came with fluttering sail,"
3964,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",Strong blew the steady ocean gale.
3965,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","The waves were running thick and high,"

3969,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",
3970,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",But from the waves the wind withdrew
3971,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",And brought the sailors close to view.
3972,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","The pilot pointed to the shore,"
3973,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",And then to gems and shining ore
3974,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",Piled up against the good ship's side
3975,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",That leaned so brave upon the tide.
3976,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",
3977,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","Oh! there were silks of colors soft,"
3978,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",And plumes that proudly waved aloft;

3980,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","From caves o'er which the water rolled,"
3981,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",And coral crowns--gifts of the sea--
3982,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",And all of this for whom? _For me._
3983,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",
3984,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",With open arms to meet the ship

3990,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",
3991,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","Ah, me! I knew not what I thought."
3992,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",The ship was by a whirlwind caught.
3993,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",It staggered out upon the sea--
3994,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",I heard the sailors cursing me;
3995,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","A flash fell from the lowering night,"

4013,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",
4014,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","But somewhere, under bluer skies,"

4018,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","'Tis loaded, too, with precious freight,"
4019,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",And for the same I stand and wait.
4020,"MT. VERNON, ILL.",
4021,"MT. VERNON, ILL.","When it comes home I'll happy be,"
