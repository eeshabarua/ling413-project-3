57,PICTURE.,
58,PICTURE.,Winter's wild birthnight! In the fretful East
59,PICTURE.,"The uneasy wind moans with its sense of cold,"
60,PICTURE.,"And sends its sighs through gloomy mountain gorge,"
61,PICTURE.,"Along the valley, up the whitening hill,"
62,PICTURE.,"To tease the sighing spirits of the pines,"
63,PICTURE.,And waste in dismal woods their chilly life.
64,PICTURE.,"The sky is dark, and on the huddled leaves--"
65,PICTURE.,"The restless, rustling leaves--sifts down its sleet,"
66,PICTURE.,"Till the sharp crystals pin them to the earth,"
67,PICTURE.,And they grow still beneath the rising storm.
68,PICTURE.,"The roofless bullock hugs the sheltering stack,"
69,PICTURE.,"With cringing head and closely gathered feet,"
70,PICTURE.,And waits with dumb endurance for the morn.
71,PICTURE.,Deep in a gusty cavern of the barn
72,PICTURE.,The witless calf stands blatant at his chain;
73,PICTURE.,"While the brute mother, pent within her stall,"
74,PICTURE.,"With the wild stress of instinct goes distraught,"
75,PICTURE.,"And frets her horns, and bellows through the night."
76,PICTURE.,The stream runs black; and the far waterfall
77,PICTURE.,"That sang so sweetly through the summer eyes,"
78,PICTURE.,"And swelled and swayed to Zephyr's softest breath,"
79,PICTURE.,"Leaps with a sullen roar the dark abyss,"
80,PICTURE.,And howls its hoarse responses to the wind.
81,PICTURE.,"The mill is still. The distant factory,"
82,PICTURE.,"That swarmed yestreen with many-fingered life,"
83,PICTURE.,And bridged the river with a hundred bars
84,PICTURE.,"Of molten light, is dark, and lifts its bulk,"
85,PICTURE.,"With dim, uncertain angles, to the sky."

88,PICTURE.,
89,PICTURE.,Yet lower bows the storm. The leafless trees
90,PICTURE.,"Lash their lithe limbs, and, with majestic voice,"
91,PICTURE.,Call to each other through the deepening gloom;
92,PICTURE.,And slender trunks that lean on burly boughs
93,PICTURE.,"Shriek with the sharp abrasion; and the oak,"
94,PICTURE.,"Mellowed in fiber by unnumbered frosts,"
95,PICTURE.,"Yields to the shoulder of the Titan Blast,"
96,PICTURE.,"Forsakes its poise, and, with a booming crash,"
97,PICTURE.,"Sweeps a fierce passage to the smothered rocks,"
98,PICTURE.,And lies a shattered ruin.

102,PICTURE.,Other scene:--
103,PICTURE.,"Across the swale, half up the pine-capped hill,"
104,PICTURE.,Stands the old farmhouse with its clump of barns--
105,PICTURE.,"The old red farmhouse--dim and dun to-night,"
106,PICTURE.,Save where the ruddy firelights from the hearth
107,PICTURE.,"Flap their bright wings against the window panes,--"
108,PICTURE.,"A billowy swarm that beat their slender bars,"
109,PICTURE.,Or seek the night to leave their track of flame
110,PICTURE.,"Upon the sleet, or sit, with shifting feet"
111,PICTURE.,"And restless plumes, among the poplar boughs--"
112,PICTURE.,"The spectral poplars, standing at the gate."
113,PICTURE.,
114,PICTURE.,"And now a man, erect, and tall, and strong,"
115,PICTURE.,"Whose thin white hair, and cheeks of furrowed bronze,"
116,PICTURE.,"And ancient dress, betray the patriarch,"
117,PICTURE.,"Stands at the window, listening to the storm;"
118,PICTURE.,And as the fire leaps with a wilder flame--
119,PICTURE.,Moved by the wind--it wraps and glorifies
120,PICTURE.,"His stalwart frame, until it flares and glows"
121,PICTURE.,"Like the old prophets, in transfigured guise,"
122,PICTURE.,That shape the sunset for cathedral aisles.
123,PICTURE.,"And now it passes, and a sweeter shape"
124,PICTURE.,Stands in its place. O blest maternity!
125,PICTURE.,"Hushed on her bosom, in a light embrace,"
126,PICTURE.,"Her baby sleeps, wrapped in its long white robe;"
127,PICTURE.,"And as the flame, with soft, auroral sweeps,"
128,PICTURE.,"Illuminates the pair, how like they seem,"
129,PICTURE.,O Virgin Mother! to thyself and thine!
130,PICTURE.,Now Samuel comes with curls of burning gold
131,PICTURE.,To hearken to the voice of God without:
132,PICTURE.,"""Speak, mighty One! Thy little servant hears!"""
133,PICTURE.,"And Miriam, maiden, from her household cares"
134,PICTURE.,"Comes to the window in her loosened robe,--"
135,PICTURE.,"Comes with the blazing timbrels in her hand,--"
136,PICTURE.,"And, as the noise of winds and waters swells,"
137,PICTURE.,It shapes the song of triumph to her lips:
138,PICTURE.,"""The horse and he who rode are overthrown!"""
139,PICTURE.,"And now a man of noble port and brow,"
140,PICTURE.,"And aspect of benignant majesty,"
141,PICTURE.,"Assumes the vacant niche, while either side"
142,PICTURE.,"Press the fair forms of children, and I hear:"
143,PICTURE.,"""Suffer the little ones to come to me!"""

150,PERSONS.,
151,PERSONS.,"Here dwells the good old farmer, Israel,"
152,PERSONS.,In his ancestral home--a Puritan
153,PERSONS.,"Who reads his Bible daily, loves his God,"
154,PERSONS.,And lives serenely in the faith of Christ.
155,PERSONS.,For threescore years and ten his life has run
156,PERSONS.,Through varied scenes of happiness and woe;
157,PERSONS.,"But, constant through the wide vicissitude,"
158,PERSONS.,"He has confessed the Giver of his joys,"
159,PERSONS.,And kissed the hand that took them; and whene'er
160,PERSONS.,"Bereavement has oppressed his soul with grief,"
161,PERSONS.,"Or sharp misfortune stung his heart with pain,"
162,PERSONS.,"He has bowed down in childlike faith, and said,"
163,PERSONS.,"""Thy will, O God--Thy will be done, not mine!"""
164,PERSONS.,"His gentle wife, a dozen summers since,"
165,PERSONS.,Passed from his faithful arms and went to heaven;
166,PERSONS.,And her best gift--a maiden sweetly named--
167,PERSONS.,"His daughter Ruth--orders the ancient house,"
168,PERSONS.,"And fills her mother's place beside the board,"
169,PERSONS.,And cheers his life with songs and industry.
170,PERSONS.,But who are these who crowd the house to-night--
171,PERSONS.,"A happy throng? Wayfaring pilgrims, who,"
172,PERSONS.,"Grateful for shelter, charm the golden hours"
173,PERSONS.,With the sweet jargon of a festival?
174,PERSONS.,Who are these fathers? who these mothers? who
175,PERSONS.,"These pleasant children, rude with health and joy?"
176,PERSONS.,
177,PERSONS.,It is the Puritan's Thanksgiving Eve;
178,PERSONS.,"And gathered home, from fresher homes around,"
179,PERSONS.,The old man's children keep the holiday--
180,PERSONS.,"In dear New England, since the fathers slept--"
181,PERSONS.,The sweetest holiday of all the year.
182,PERSONS.,"John comes with Prudence and her little girls,"
183,PERSONS.,"And Peter, matched with Patience, brings his boys--"
184,PERSONS.,Fair boys and girls with good old Scripture names--
185,PERSONS.,"Joseph, Rebekah, Paul, and Samuel;"
186,PERSONS.,"And Grace, young Ruth's companion in the house,"
187,PERSONS.,Till wrested from her last Thanksgiving Day
188,PERSONS.,"By the strong hand of Love, brings home her babe"
189,PERSONS.,"And the tall poet David, at whose side"
190,PERSONS.,"She went away. And seated in the midst,"
191,PERSONS.,"Mary, a foster-daughter of the house,"
192,PERSONS.,Of alien blood--self-aliened many a year--
193,PERSONS.,Whose chastened face and melancholy eyes
194,PERSONS.,"Bring all the wondering children to her knee,"
195,PERSONS.,"Weeps with the strange excess of happiness,"
196,PERSONS.,And sighs with joy.
197,PERSONS.,What recks the driving storm
198,PERSONS.,Of such a scene as this? And what reck these
199,PERSONS.,Of such a storm? For every heavy gust
200,PERSONS.,"That smites the windows with its cloud of sleet,"
201,PERSONS.,"And shakes the sashes with its ghostly hands,"
202,PERSONS.,And rocks the mansion till the chimney's throat
203,PERSONS.,"Through all its sooty caverns shrieks and howls,"
204,PERSONS.,"They give full bursts of careless merriment,"
205,PERSONS.,Or songs that send it baffled on its way.

212,PRELUDE.,
213,PRELUDE.,Doubt takes to wings on such a night as this;
214,PRELUDE.,"And while the traveler hugs her fluttering cloak,"
215,PRELUDE.,"And staggers o'er the weary waste alone,"
216,PRELUDE.,"Beneath a pitiless heaven, they flap his face,"
217,PRELUDE.,"And wheel above, or hunt his fainting soul,"
218,PRELUDE.,"As, with relentless greed, a vulture throng,"
219,PRELUDE.,With their lank shadows mock the glazing eyes
220,PRELUDE.,Of the last camel of the caravan.
221,PRELUDE.,And Faith takes forms and wings on such a night.
222,PRELUDE.,"Where love burns brightly at the household hearth,"
223,PRELUDE.,And from the altar of each peaceful heart
224,PRELUDE.,"Ascends the fragrant incense of its thanks,"
225,PRELUDE.,And every pulse with sympathetic throb
226,PRELUDE.,"Tells the true rhythm of trustfulest content,"
227,PRELUDE.,"They flutter in and out, and touch to smiles"
228,PRELUDE.,The sleeping lips of infancy; and fan
229,PRELUDE.,The blush that lights the modest maiden's cheeks;
230,PRELUDE.,And toss the locks of children at their play.
231,PRELUDE.,
232,PRELUDE.,Silence is vocal if we listen well;
233,PRELUDE.,And Life and Being sing in dullest ears
234,PRELUDE.,"From morn to night, from night to morn again,"
235,PRELUDE.,With fine articulations; but when God
236,PRELUDE.,"Disturbs the soul with terror, or inspires"
237,PRELUDE.,"With a great joy, the words of Doubt and Faith"
238,PRELUDE.,Sound quick and sharp like drops on forest leaves;
239,PRELUDE.,And we look up to where the pleasant sky
240,PRELUDE.,"Kisses the thunder-caps, and drink the song."

435,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,To comfort an old man.
436,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
437,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Israel_.
438,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Ruth, that will do!"
439,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Remember I'm a Justice of the Peace,"
440,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And bide no quarrels; and if you and David
441,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Persist in strife, I'll place you under bonds"
442,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"For good behavior, or condemn you both"
443,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,To solitary durance for the night.
444,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
445,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Ruth_.
446,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
447,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Father, you fail to understand the case,"
448,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And do me wrong. David has threatened me
449,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,With an assault that proves intent to kill;
450,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"And here's my sister Grace, his wedded wife,"
451,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Who'll take her oath, that just a year ago"
452,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,He entered into bonds to keep the peace
453,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Toward me and womankind.

455,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_David_.
456,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
457,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I'm quite asleep.

464,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
465,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Till he awake again, of course. I trust"
466,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I have sufficient gallantry to grant
467,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"A nap between encounters, to a foe"
468,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,With odds against him.
469,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
470,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Israel_.
471,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
472,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Peace, my daughter, peace!"
473,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"You've had your full revenge, and we have had"
474,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Enough of laughter since the day began.
475,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,We must not squander all these precious hours
476,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,In jest and merriment; for when the sun
477,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Shall rise to-morrow, we shall separate,"
478,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Not knowing we shall ever meet again.
479,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Meetings like this are rare this side of Heaven,"
480,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And seem to me the best mementoes left
481,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Of Eden's hours.
482,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
483,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Grace_.
484,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
485,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Most certainly the best,"
486,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"And quite the rarest, but, unluckily,"
487,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"The weakest, as we know; for sin and pain"

492,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_David_.
493,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
494,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Forfeit through woman.

496,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Grace_.
497,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
498,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Forfeit through her power;--

500,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Beyond the knowledge of their trustful wives.
501,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,

503,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
504,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"[_Rising, and walking hurriedly to the window_.]"
505,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
506,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,'Tis a wild night without.
507,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
508,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Ruth_.
509,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
510,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And getting wild
511,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Within. Now, Grace, I--all of us--protest"
512,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Against a scene to-night. Look! You have driven
513,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"One to the window blushing, and your lord,"
514,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"With lowering brow, is making stern essay"
515,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,To stare the fire-dogs out of countenance.
516,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"These honest brothers, with their honest wives,"
517,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Grow glum and solemn, too, as if they feared"
518,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"At the next gust to see the windows burst,"
519,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Or a riven poplar crashing through the roof.
520,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And think of me!--a simple-hearted maid
521,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Who learned from Cowper only yesterday
522,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"(Or a schoolmaster, with a handsome face,"
523,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"And a strange passion for the text), the fact,"
524,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,That wedded bliss alone survives the fall.
525,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I'm shocked; I'm frightened; and I'll never wed
526,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Unless I--change my mind!
527,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
528,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Israel_.
529,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
530,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And I consent.
531,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
532,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_David_.
533,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
534,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And the schoolmaster with the handsome face

536,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
537,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Ruth_.
538,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
539,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Your pardon, father, for the jest!"
540,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,But I have never patience with the ills
541,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,That make intrusion on my happy hours.
542,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"I know the world is full of evil things,"
543,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And shudder with the consciousness. I know
544,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,That care has iron crowns for many brows;
545,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"That Calvaries are everywhere, whereon"
546,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Virtue is crucified, and nails and spears"
547,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Draw guiltless blood; that sorrow sits and drinks
548,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"At sweetest hearts, till all their life is dry;"
549,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,That gentle spirits on the rack of pain
550,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Grow faint or fierce, and pray and curse by turns;"
551,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"That Hell's temptations, clad in Heavenly guise"
552,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"And armed with might, lie evermore in wait"
553,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Along life's path, giving assault to all--"
554,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Fatal to most; that Death stalks through the earth,"
555,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Choosing his victims, sparing none at last;"
556,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,That in each shadow of a pleasant tree
557,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,A grief sits sadly sobbing to its leaves;
558,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And that beside each fearful soul there walks
559,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"The dim, gaunt phantom of uncertainty,"
560,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Bidding it look before, where none may see,"
561,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And all must go; but I forget it all--
562,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I thrust it from me always when I may;
563,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Else I should faint with fear, or drown myself"
564,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,In pity. God forgive me! but I've thought
565,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,A thousand times that if I had His power.
566,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Or He my love, we'd have a different world"
567,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,From this we live in.
568,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
569,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Israel_.
570,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
571,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Those are sinful thoughts,"
572,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"My daughter, and too surely indicate"
573,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"A willful soul, unreconciled to God."
574,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
575,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Ruth_.
576,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
577,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,So you have told me often. You have said
578,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"That God is just, and I have looked around"
579,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"To seek the proof in human lot, in vain."
580,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"The rain falls kindly on the just man's fields,"
581,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,But on the unjust man's more kindly still;
582,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"And I have never known the winter's blast,"
583,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Or the quick lightning, or the pestilence,"
584,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Make nice discriminations when let slip
585,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,From God's right hand.
586,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
587,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Israel_.
588,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
589,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,'Tis a great mystery;
590,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Yet God is just, and,--blessed be His name!--"
591,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Is loving too. I know that I am weak,"
592,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And that the pathway of His Providence
593,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Is on the hills where I may never climb.
594,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Therefore my reason yields her hand to Faith,"
595,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And follows meekly where the angel leads.
596,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"I see the rich man have his portion here,"
597,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"And Lazarus, in glorified repose,"
598,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Sleep like a jewel on the breast of Faith
599,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,In Heaven's broad light. I see that whom God loves
600,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"He chastens sorely, but I ask not why."
601,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I only know that God is just and good:
602,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,All else is mystery. Why evil lives
603,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Within His universe, I may not know."
604,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"I know it lives, and taints the vital air;"
605,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And that in ways inscrutable to me--
606,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Yet compromising not His soundless love
607,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And boundless power--it lives against His will.
608,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
609,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Ruth_.
610,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
611,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I am not satisfied. If evil live
612,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Against God's will, evil is king of all,"
613,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And they do well who worship Lucifer.
614,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I am not satisfied. My reason spurns
615,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Such prostitution to absurdities.
616,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I know that you are happy; but I shrink
617,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,From your blind faith with loathing and with fear.
618,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"And feel that I must win it, if I win,"
619,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"With the surrender, not of will alone,"
620,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,But of the noblest faculty that God
621,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Has crowned me with.
622,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
623,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Israel_.
624,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
625,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,O blind and stubborn child!
626,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"My light, my joy, my burden and my grief!"
627,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"How would I lead you to the wells of peace,"
628,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And see you dip your fevered palms and drink!
629,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Gladly to purchase this would I lay down
630,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"The precious remnant of my life, and sleep,"
631,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Wrapped in the faith you spurn, till the archangel"
632,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Sounds the last trump. But God's good will be done!
633,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I leave you with Him.
634,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
635,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Ruth_.
636,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
637,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Father, talk not thus!"
638,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Oh, do not blame me! I would do it all,"
639,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,If but to bless you with a single joy;
640,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,But I am helpless.
641,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
642,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Israel_.
643,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
644,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"God will help you, Ruth."

646,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Ruth_.
647,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
648,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,To quench my reason? Can I ask the boon?
649,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,My lips would blister with the blasphemy.
650,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I cannot take your faith; and that is why
651,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I would forget that I am in a world
652,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Where evil lives, and why I guard my joys"
653,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,With such a jealous care.
654,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
655,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_David_.
656,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
657,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"There, Ruth, sit down!"
658,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"'Tis the old question, with the old reply."
659,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"You fly along the path, with bleeding feet,"
660,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Where many feet have flown and bled before;
661,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And he who seeks to guide you to the goal
662,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Has (let me say it, father) stopped far short,"
663,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"And taken refuge at a wayside inn,"
664,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Whose haunted halls and mazy passages
665,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Receive no light, save through the riddled roof,"
666,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Pierced thick by pilgrim staves, that Faith may lie"
667,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Upon its back, and only gaze on Heaven."
668,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I would not banish evil if I could;
669,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Nor would I be so deep in love with joy
670,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"As to seek for it in forgetfulness,"
671,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Through faith or fear.
672,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
673,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Ruth_.
674,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
675,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Teach me the better way,"
676,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And every expiration from my lips
677,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Shall be a grateful blessing on your head;
678,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And in the coming world I'll seek the side
679,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Of no more gracious angel than the man
680,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Who gives me brotherhood by leading me
681,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Home with himself to heaven.
682,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
683,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Israel_.
684,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
685,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"My son,"
686,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Be careful of your words! 'Tis no light thing
687,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,To take the guidance of a straying soul.
688,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
689,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_David_.
690,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
691,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"I mark the burden well, and love it, too,"
692,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Because I love the girl and love her Lord,"
693,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And seek to vindicate His love to her
694,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And waken hers for Him. Be this my plea:
695,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,God is almighty--all-benevolent;
696,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And naught exists save by His loving will.
697,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Evil, or what we reckon such, exists,"
698,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And not against His will; else the Supreme
699,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Is subject, and we have in place of God"
700,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"A phantom nothing, with a phantom name."
701,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Therefore I care not whether He ordain
702,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"That evil live, or whether He permit;"
703,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Therefore I ask not why, in either case,"
704,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"As if He meant to curse me, but I ask"
705,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,What He would have this evil do for me?
706,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,What is its mission? what its ministry?
707,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,What golden fruit lies hidden in its husk?
708,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"How shall it nurse my virtue, nerve my will,"
709,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Chasten my passions, purify my love,"
710,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And make me in some goodly sense like Him
711,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Who bore the cross of evil while He lived,"
712,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Who hung and bled upon it when He died,"

721,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Lost in the lapse of Eden?
722,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
723,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_David_.
724,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And would you
725,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Or Ruth 'have restoration of that bliss,"
726,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And welcome transplantation to the state

729,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,_Ruth_.
730,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,
731,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Would I? Would I not!
732,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Oh, I have dreamed of it a thousand times,"
733,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Sleeping and waking, since the torch of thought"
734,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Flashed into flame at Revelation's touch,"
735,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And filled my spirit with its quenchless fire.
736,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Most envious dreams of innocence and joy
737,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Have haunted me,--dreams that were born in sin,"
738,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Yet swathed in stainless snow. I've dreamed, and dreamed,"
739,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Of wondrous trees, crowned with perennial green,"
740,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Whose soft still shadows gleamed with golden lamps
741,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Of pensile fruitage, or were flushed with life"
742,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Radiant and tuneful when broad flocks of birds
743,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Swept in and out like sheets of living flame.
744,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"I've dreamed of aisles tufted with velvet grass,"
745,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And bordered with the strange intelligence
746,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Of myriad loving eyes among the flowers,"
747,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"That watched me with a curious, calm delight,"
748,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,As rows of wayside cherubim may watch
749,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"A new soul, walking into Paradise."
750,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I've dreamed of sunsets when the sun supine
751,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Lay rocking on the ocean like a god,"
752,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"And threw his weary arms far up the sky,"
753,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And with vermilion-tinted fingers toyed
754,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,With the long tresses of the evening star.
755,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I've dreamed of dreams more beautiful than all--
756,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Dreams that were music, perfume, vision, bliss,--"
757,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Blent and sublimed, till I have stood inwrapped"
758,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,In the thick essence of an atmosphere
759,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,That made me tremble to unclose my eyes
760,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Lest I should look on God. And I have dreamed
761,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Of sinless men and maids, mated in heaven,"
762,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Ere yet their souls had sought for beauteous forms
763,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"To give them human sense and residence,"

785,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"That dwelt in Eden--powerless, pulpy souls"
786,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,That showed a dimple for each touch of sin.
787,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"God seeks for virtue, and, that it may live,"
788,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"It must resist, and that which it resists"
789,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Must live. Believe me, God has other thought"
790,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Than restoration of our fallen race
791,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,To its primeval innocence and bliss.

793,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"From the foundation of the world, it was"
794,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Because our evil lived in essence then--

797,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Not into Adam's sweet similitude--
798,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"But the more glorious image of Himself,"
799,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,A resolution of our destiny
800,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,As high transcending Eden's life and lot
801,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,As He surpasses Eden's fallen lord.

818,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I am ashamed that in this Christian age
819,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,The pious throng still hug the fallacy

850,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Until the gnarly muscles of his limbs
851,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And the free blood that thrills in all his veins
852,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Betray the health that toil alone secures,"

854,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Do you ask truth's credentials of the storm
855,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Which, while we entertain communion here,"
856,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Makes better music for our huddling hearts
857,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,Than choirs of stars can sing in fairest nights?

915,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"Blighting her breath, and poisoning her blood."
916,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,I see her frantic with a fearful thought
917,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"That haunts and horrifies her shrinking soul,"
918,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,And bursts in sighs and sobs and feverish prayers;
919,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"And now, at last, the awful struggle ends,"
920,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"A sweet smile sits upon her angel face,"
921,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"And peace, with downy bosom, nestles close"

923,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"As the death shadows gather; closer still,"
924,THE QUESTION STATED AND ARGUED.,"As, on white wings, the outward-going soul"

2027,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2028,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"No--yes! Perhaps he pitied me, and that"

2175,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"In this, I'll prove my friendship, if I lose"

2206,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,As if he were an unclean beast. O Grace!
2207,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I cannot paint the horrors of that night.
2208,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"My heart, till then serene, and safely kept"
2209,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"In Trust's strong citadel, quaked all night long,"
2210,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,As tower and bastion fell before the rush
2211,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Of fierce convictions; and the tumbling walls
2212,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Boomed with dull throbs of ruin through my brain.
2213,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And there were palaces that leaned on this--
2214,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Castles of air, in long and glittering lines,"
2215,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Which melted into air, and pierced the blue"
2216,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That marks the star-strewn vault of heaven;--all fell,"
2217,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,With a faint crash like that which scares the soul

2227,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The stupid dreamer at my side awoke,"
2228,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And with such helpless anguish as they feel

2238,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That I could only hold him till the wave
2239,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Of some overwhelming impulse should sweep in,"
2240,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,To lift his feet and bear him from my arms.
2241,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I felt that morn, when he went trembling forth,"
2242,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"With bloodshot eyes and forehead hot with woe,"
2243,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That henceforth strife would be 'twixt Hell and me--
2244,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The odds against me--for my husband's soul.

2263,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"When appetite or passion moved in him,"
2264,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That clothed his sins with fair apologies,"
2265,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And smoothed the wrinkles of a haggard guilt
2266,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,With the good-natured hand of charity.
2267,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He knew he was a fool, he said, and said again;"
2268,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"But human nature would be what it was,"
2269,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And life had never zest enough to bear
2270,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Too much dilution; those who work like slaves
2271,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Must have their days of frolic and of fun.
2272,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,He doubted whether God would punish sin;
2273,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"God was, in fact, too good to punish sin;"
2274,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"For sin itself was a compounded thing,"
2275,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,With weakness for its prime ingredient.
2276,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And thus he fooled a heart that loved him well;
2277,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And it went toward his heart by slow degrees,"
2278,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Till Virtue seemed a frigid anchorite,"
2279,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And Vice, a jolly fellow--bad enough,"
2280,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,But not so bad as Christian people think.
2281,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2282,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"This was the cunning work of months--nay, years;"
2283,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, meantime, Edward sank from bad to worse."
2284,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"But he had conquered. Wine was on his board,"
2285,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Without my protest--with a glass for me!
2286,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"His boon companions came and went, and made"
2287,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,My home their rendezvous with my consent.
2288,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The doughty oath that shocked my ears at first,"
2289,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The doubtful jest that meant, or might not mean,"
2290,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That which should set a woman's brow aflame,"
2291,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Became at last (oh, shame of womanhood!)"
2292,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,A thing to frown at with a covert smile;
2293,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Anything to smile at with a decent frown;
2294,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A thing to steal a grace from, as I feigned"
2295,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The innocence of deaf unconsciousness.
2296,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And I became a jester. I could jest
2297,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,In a wild way on sacred things and themes;
2298,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And I have thought that in his better moods
2299,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,My husband shrank with horror from the work
2300,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Which he had wrought in me.
2301,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2302,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I do not know
2303,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"If, during all these downward-tending years,"
2304,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Edward kept well his faith with me. I know
2305,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He used to tell me, in his boastful way,"
2306,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,How he had broke the hearts of pretty maids.
2307,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And that if he were single--well-a-day!
2308,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The time was past for thinking upon that!
2309,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And I had heart to toss the badinage
2310,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Back in his teeth, with pay of kindred coin;"
2311,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And tell him lies to stir his bestial mirth;
2312,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And make my boast of conquests; and pretend
2313,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That the true heart I had bestowed on him
2314,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Had flown, and left him but an empty hand."
2315,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2316,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I had some days of pain and penitence.
2317,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I saw where all must end. I saw, too well,"
2318,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Edward was growing idle,--that his form"
2319,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Was gathering disgustful corpulence,--"
2320,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That he was going down, and dragging me"
2321,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"To shame and ruin, beggary and death."
2322,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"But judgment came, and overshadowed us;"
2323,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And one quick bolt shot from the awful cloud
2324,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Severed the tie that bound two worthless lives.
2325,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"What God hath joined together, God may part:--"
2326,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Grace, have you thought of that?"
2327,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2328,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,_Grace_.
2329,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2330,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"You scare me, Mary!"
2331,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Nay! Do not turn on me with such a look!
2332,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Its dread suggestion gives my heart a pang
2333,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That stops its painful beating.
2334,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2335,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,_Mary_.
2336,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2337,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Let it pass!
2338,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"One morn we woke with the first flush of light,"
2339,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Our windows jarring with the cannonade
2340,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That ushered in the nation's festal day.
2341,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The village streets were full of men and boys,"
2342,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And resonant with rattling mimicry
2343,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Of the black-throated monsters on the hill,--"
2344,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A crashing, crepitating war of fire,--"
2345,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And as we listened to the fitful feud,"
2346,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Dull detonations came from far away,"
2347,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Pulsing along the fretted atmosphere,"
2348,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,To tell that in the ruder villages
2349,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The day had noisy greeting, as in ours."
2350,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2351,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I know not why it was, but then, and there,"
2352,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I felt a sinking sadness, passing tears--"
2353,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A dark foreboding I could not dissolve,"
2354,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Nor drive away. But when, next morn, I woke"
2355,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"In the sweet stillness of the Sabbath day,"
2356,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And found myself alone, I knew that hearts"
2357,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Which once have been God's temple, and in which"
2358,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Something divine still lingers, feel the throb"
2359,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Along the lines that bind them to the Throne
2360,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"When judgment issues; and, though dumb and blind,"
2361,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Shudder and faint with prophecies of ill.
2362,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"How--by what cause--calamity should come,"
2363,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I could not guess; that it was imminent
2364,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Seemed just as certain as the morning's dawn.
2365,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"We were to have a gala day, indeed."
2366,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,There were to be processions and parades;
2367,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A great oration in a mammoth tent,"
2368,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"With dinner following, and toast and speech"
2369,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,By all the wordy magnates of the town;
2370,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,A grand balloon ascension afterwards;
2371,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, in the evening, fireworks on the hill."
2372,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I knew that drink would flow from morn till night
2373,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"In a wild maelstrom, circling slow around"
2374,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The village rim, in bright careering waves,"
2375,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"But growing turbulent, and changed to ink"
2376,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Around the village center, till, at last,"
2377,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The whirling, gurgling vortex would engulf"
2378,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,A maddened multitude in drunkenness.
2379,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And this was in my thought (the while my heart
2380,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Was palpitating with its nameless fear),"
2381,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"As, wrapped in vaguest dreams, and purposeless,"
2382,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I laced my shoe and gazed upon the sky.
2383,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Then strange determination stirred in me;
2384,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, turning sharply on my chair, I said,"
2385,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"""Edward, where'er you go to-day, I go!"""
2386,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"If I had smitten him upon the face,"
2387,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,It had not tingled with a hotter flame.
2388,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,He turned upon me with a look of hate--
2389,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A something worse than anger--and, with oaths,"
2390,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Raved like a fiend, and cursed me for a fool."
2391,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,But I was firm; he could not shake my will;
2392,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"So, through the morning, until afternoon,"
2393,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He stayed at home, and drank and drank again,"
2394,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Watching the clock, and pacing up and down,"
2395,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Until, at length, he came and sat by me,"
2396,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,To try his hackneyed tricks of blandishment.
2397,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He had not meant, he said, to give offense;"
2398,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,But women in a crowd were out of place.
2399,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He wished to see the aeronauts embark,"
2400,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And meet some friends; but there would be a throng
2401,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Of boys and drunken boors around the car,"
2402,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And I should not enjoy it; more than this,"
2403,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The rise would be a finer spectacle
2404,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"At home than on the ground. I gave assent,"
2405,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And he went out. Of course, I followed him;"
2406,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"For I had learned to read him, and I knew"
2407,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,There was some precious scheme of sin on foot.
2408,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2409,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The crowd was heavy, and his form was lost"
2410,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Quick as it touched the mass; but I pressed on,"
2411,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Wild shouts and laughter punishing my ears,"
2412,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Till I could see the bloated, breathing cone,"
2413,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,As if it were some monster of the sky
2414,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Caught by a net and fastened to the earth--
2415,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,A butt for jeers to all the merry mob.
2416,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,But I was distant still; and if a man
2417,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,In mad impatience tore a passage from
2418,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The crowd that pressed upon him, or a girl,"
2419,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Frightened or fainting, was allowed escape,"
2420,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I slid like water to the vacant space,"
2421,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And thus, by deftly won advances, gained"
2422,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The stand I coveted.
2423,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2424,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,We waited long;
2425,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And as the curious gazers stood and talked
2426,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"About the diverse currents of the air,"
2427,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And wondered where the daring voyagers
2428,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Would find a landing-place, a young man said,"
2429,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"In words intended for a spicy jest,"
2430,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,A man and woman living in the town
2431,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Had taken passage overland for hell!
2432,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2433,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Then at a distance rose a scattering shout
2434,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That fixed the vision of the multitude,"
2435,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Standing on eager tiptoe, and afar"
2436,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I saw the crowd give way, and make a path"
2437,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,For the pale heroes of the crazy hour.
2438,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Hats were tossed wildly as they struggled on,"
2439,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And the gap closed behind them, till, at length,"
2440,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"They stood within the ring. Oh, damning sight!"
2441,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The woman was a painted courtezan;
2442,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The man, my husband! I was dumb as death."
2443,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"My teeth were clenched together like a vise,"
2444,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And every heavy heart-throb was a chill.
2445,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"But there I stood, and saw the shame go on."
2446,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,They took their seats; the signal gun was fired;
2447,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The cords were loosed; and then the billowy bulk
2448,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Shot toward the zenith!
2449,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2450,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Never bent the sky
2451,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,With a more cloudless depth of blue than then;
2452,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, as they rose, I saw his faithless arm"
2453,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Slide o'er her shoulder, and her dizzy head"
2454,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Drop on his breast. Then I became insane.
2455,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I felt that I was struggling with a dream--
2456,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,A horrid phantasm I could not shake off.
2457,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The hollow sky was swinging like a bell;
2458,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The silken monster swinging like its tongue;
2459,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And as it reeled from side to side, the roar"
2460,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Of voices round me rang, and rang again,"
2461,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Tolling the dreadful knell of my despair.
2462,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2463,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"At the last moment I could trace his form,"
2464,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Edward leaned over from his giddy seat,"
2465,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And tossed out something on the air. I saw
2466,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The little missive fluttering slowly down,"
2467,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And stretched my hand to catch it, for I knew,"
2468,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Or thought I knew, that it would come to me."
2469,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And it did come to me--as if it slid
2470,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Upon the cord that bound my heart to his--
2471,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Strained to its utmost tension--snapped at last.
2472,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I marked it as it fell. It was a rose.
2473,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I grasped it madly as it struck my hand,"
2474,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And buried all its thorns within my palm;
2475,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"But the fierce pain released my prisoned voice,"
2476,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, with a shriek, I staggered, swooned, and fell."
2477,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2478,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That night was brushed from life. A passing friend
2479,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Directed those who bore me rudely off;
2480,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And I was carried to my home, and laid"
2481,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Entranced upon my bed. The Sabbath morn
2482,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That followed all this din and devilry
2483,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Swung noiseless wide its doors of yellow light,"
2484,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And in the hallowed stillness I awoke.
2485,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,My heart was still; I could not stir a hand.
2486,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I thought that I was dying, or was dead.--"
2487,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That I had slipped through smooth unconsciousness
2488,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Into the everlasting silences.
2489,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I could not speak; but winning strength, at last,"
2490,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I turned my eyes to seek for Edward's face,"
2491,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And saw an unpressed pillow. He was gone!
2492,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2493,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I was oppressed with awful sense of loss;
2494,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, as a mother, by a turbid sea"
2495,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That has engulfed her fairest child, sits down"
2496,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And moans over the waters, and looks out"
2497,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"With curious despair upon the waves,"
2498,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Until she marks a lock of floating hair,"
2499,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And by its threads of gold draws slowly in,"
2500,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And clasps and presses to her frenzied breast
2501,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The form it has no power to warm again,"
2502,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"So I, beside the sea of memory,"
2503,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Lay feebly moaning, yearning for a clew"
2504,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,By which to reach my own extinguished life.
2505,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"It came. A burning pain shot through my palm,"
2506,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And thorns awoke what thorns had put to sleep.
2507,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"It all came back to me--the roar, the rush,"
2508,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The upturned faces, the insane hurrahs,"
2509,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The skyward-shooting spectacle, the shame--"
2510,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And then I swooned again.
2511,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2512,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,_Grace_.
2513,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2514,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,But was he killed?
2515,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Did his foolhardy venture end in wreck?
2516,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Or did it end in something worse than wreck?
2517,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Surely, he came again!"
2518,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2519,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,_Mary_.
2520,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2521,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"To me, no more."
2522,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He had his reasons, and I knew them soon;"
2523,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"But, first, the fire enkindled in my brain"
2524,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Burnt through long weeks of fever--burnt my frame
2525,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Until it lay upon the sheet as white
2526,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,As the pale ashes of a wasted coal.
2527,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Then, when strength came to me, and I could sit,"
2528,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Braced by the double pillows that were mine,"
2529,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A kind friend took my hand, and told me all."
2530,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2531,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The day that Edward left me was the last
2532,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,He could have been my husband; for the next
2533,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Disclosed his infamy and my disgrace.
2534,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He was a thief, and had been one, for years,--"
2535,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Defrauding those whose gold he held in trust;
2536,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And he was ruined--ruined utterly.
2537,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The very bed I sat on was not his,"
2538,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Nor mine, except by tender charity."
2539,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A guilty secret menacing behind,"
2540,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A guilty passion burning in his heart,"
2541,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, by his side, a guilty paramour,"
2542,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He seized upon this reckless whim, and fled"
2543,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,From those he knew would curse him ere he slept.
2544,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2545,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,My cup was filled with wormwood; and it grew
2546,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Bitter and still more bitter, day by day,"
2547,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Changing from shame and hate, to stern revenge."
2548,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Life had no more for me. My home was lost;
2549,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,My heart unfitted to return to this;
2550,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, reckless of the future, I went forth--"
2551,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A woman stricken, maddened, desperate."
2552,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I sought the city with as sure a scent
2553,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,As vultures track a carcass through the air.
2554,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I knew him there, delivered up to sin,"
2555,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And longed to taunt him with his infamy,--"
2556,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,To haunt his haunts; to sting his perjured soul
2557,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,With sharp reproaches; and to scare his eyes--
2558,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,With visions of his work upon my face.
2559,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2560,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,But God had other means than my revenge
2561,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"To humble him, and other thought for me."
2562,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I saw him only once; we did not meet;
2563,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,There was a street between us; yet it seemed
2564,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Wide as the unbridged gulf that yawns between
2565,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The rich man and the beggar.
2566,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2567,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,'Twas at dawn.
2568,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I had arisen from the sleepless bed
2569,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Which my scant means had purchased, and gone forth"
2570,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"To taste the air, and cool my burning brow."
2571,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I wandered on, not knowing where I went,"
2572,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Nor caring whither. There were few astir;
2573,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The market wagons lumbered slowly in,"
2574,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Piled high with carcasses of slaughtered lambs,"
2575,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Baskets of unhusked corn, and mint, and all"
2576,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The fresh, green things that grow in country fields."
2577,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I read the signs--the long and curious names--
2578,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And wondered who invented them, and if"
2579,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Their owners knew how very strange they were.
2580,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A corps of weary firemen met me once,"
2581,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Late home from service, with their gaudy car,"
2582,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And loud with careless curses. Then I stopped,"
2583,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And chatted with a frowsy-headed girl
2584,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Who knelt among her draggled skirts, and scrubbed"
2585,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The heel-worn doorsteps of a faded house.
2586,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Then, as I left her, and resumed my walk,"
2587,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I turned my eyes across the street, and saw"
2588,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A sight which stopped my feet, my breath, my heart."
2589,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"It was my husband. Oh, how sadly changed!"
2590,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,His bloodshot eyes stared from an anxious face;
2591,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"His hat was battered, and his clothes were torn"
2592,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And splashed with mud. His poisoned frame
2593,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Had shrunk away, until his garments hung"
2594,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,In folds about him. Then I knew it all:
2595,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,His life had been a measureless debauch
2596,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Since his most shameless flight; and in his eye,"
2597,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Eager and strained, and peering down the stairs"
2598,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That tumbled to the anterooms of hell,"
2599,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I saw the thirst which only death can quench.
2600,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,He did not raise his eyes; I did not speak;
2601,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,There was no work for me to do on him;
2602,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And when, at last, he tottered down the steps"
2603,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Of a dark gin-shop, I was satisfied,"
2604,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And half relentingly retraced my way.
2605,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2606,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I cannot tell the story of the months
2607,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That followed this. I toiled and toiled for bread,"
2608,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And for the shelter of one stingy room.
2609,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Temptation, which the hand of poverty"
2610,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Bears oft seductively to woman's lips,"
2611,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,To me came not. I hated men like beasts;
2612,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Their flattering words, and wicked, wanton leers,"
2613,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Sickened me with ineffable disgust.
2614,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"At length there came a change. One warm Spring eve,"
2615,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"As I sat idly dreaming of the past,"
2616,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And questioning the future, my quick ear"
2617,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Caught sound of feet upon the creaking stairs,"
2618,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And a light rap delivered at my door.
2619,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I said, ""Come in!"" with half-defiant voice,"
2620,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Although I longed to see a human face,"
2621,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And needed labor for my idle hands.
2622,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"But when the door was opened, and there stood"
2623,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A man before me, with an eye as pure"
2624,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And brow as fair as any little child's,"
2625,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Matched with a form and carriage which combined
2626,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"All manly beauty, dignity, and grace,"
2627,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A quick blush overwhelmed my pallid cheeks,"
2628,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, ere I knew, and by no act of will,"
2629,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I rose and gave him gentle courtesy.
2630,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2631,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He took a seat, and spoke with pleasant voice"
2632,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Of many pleasant things--the pleasant sky,"
2633,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The stars, the opening foliage in the park;"
2634,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And then he came to business. He would have
2635,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,A piece of exquisite embroidery;
2636,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,My hand was cunning if report were true;
2637,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Would it oblige him? It would do, I said,"
2638,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That which it could to satisfy his wish;
2639,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And when he took the delicate pattern out,"
2640,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And spread the dainty fabric on his knees,"
2641,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I knew he had a wife.
2642,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2643,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,He went away
2644,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"With kind ""Good night,"" and said that, with my leave,"
2645,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,He'd call and watch the progress of the work.
2646,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I marked his careful steps adown the stairs,"
2647,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And then, his brisk, firm tread upon the pave,"
2648,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Till in the dull roar of the distant streets
2649,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"It mingled and was lost. Then I was lost,--"
2650,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Lost in a wild, wide-ranging reverie--"
2651,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,From which I roused not till the midnight hush
2652,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Was broken by the toll from twenty towers.
2653,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"This is a man, I said; a man in truth;"
2654,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"My room has known the presence of a man,"
2655,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And it has gathered dignity from him.
2656,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I felt my being flooded with new life.
2657,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"My heart was warm; my poor, sore-footed thoughts"
2658,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Sprang up full fledged through ether; and I felt
2659,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Like the sick woman who had touched the hem
2660,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Of Jesus' garment, when through all her veins"
2661,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Leaped the swift tides of youth.
2662,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2663,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,He had a wife!
2664,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Why, to a wrecked, forsaken thing like me"
2665,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Did that thought bring a pang? I did not know;
2666,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"But, truth to tell, it gave me stinging pain."
2667,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"If he was noble, he was naught to me;"
2668,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"If he was great, it only made me less;"
2669,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"If he loved truly, I was not enriched."
2670,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"So, in my selfishness, I almost cursed"
2671,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The unknown woman, thought for whom had brought"
2672,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Her loving husband to me. What was I
2673,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"To him? Naught but a poor unfortunate,"
2674,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Picking her bread up at a needle's point.
2675,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He'll come and criticise my handiwork,"
2676,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I said, and when it is at last complete,"
2677,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,He'll draw his purse and give me so much gold;
2678,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And then, forgetting me for ever, go"
2679,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And gather fragrant kisses for the boon,"
2680,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,From lips that do not know their privilege.
2681,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I could be nothing but the medium
2682,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Through which his love should pass to reach its shrine;
2683,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The glass through which the sun's electric beams
2684,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Kindles the rose's heart, and still remains"
2685,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Chill and serene itself--without reward!
2686,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Then came to me the thought of my great wrong.
2687,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A man had spoiled my heart, degraded me;"
2688,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,A wanton woman had defrauded me;
2689,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I would get reparation how I could!
2690,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,He must be something to me--I to him!
2691,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"All men, however good, are weak, I thought;"
2692,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And if I can arrest no beam of love
2693,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"By right of nature or by leave of law,"
2694,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I'll stain the glass! And the last words I said,"
2695,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"As I lay down upon my bed to dream,"
2696,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Were those four words of sin: ""I'll stain the glass!"""
2697,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2698,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,_Grace_.
2699,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2700,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Mary, I cannot hear you more; your tale,"
2701,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,So bitter and so passing pitiful
2702,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I have forgotten tears, and feel my eyes"
2703,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Burn dry and hot with looking at your face,"
2704,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Now gathers blackness, and grows horrible."
2705,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2706,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,_Mary_.
2707,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2708,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Nay, you must hear me out; I cannot pause;"
2709,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And have no worse to say than I have said--
2710,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Thank God, and him who put away my toils!"
2711,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He came, and came again; and every charm"
2712,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"God had bestowed on me, or art could frame,"
2713,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I used with keenest ingenuities
2714,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,To fascinate the sensuous element
2715,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"O'er which, mistrusted, and but half asleep,"
2716,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,His conscience and propriety stood guard.
2717,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I told with tears the story of my woe;
2718,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He listened to me with a thoughtful face,"
2719,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And sadly sighed; and thus I won his ruth,"
2720,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And then I told him how my life was lost;--
2721,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,How earth had nothing more for me but pain;
2722,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Not e'en a friend. At this, he took my hand,"
2723,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And said, out of his nobleness of heart,"
2724,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That I should have an honest friend in him;
2725,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"On which I bowed my head upon his arm,"
2726,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And wept again, as if my heart would break"
2727,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,With the full pressure of his gratitude.
2728,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He put me gently off, and read my face:"
2729,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I stood before him hopeless, helpless, his!"
2730,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,His swift soul gathered what I meant it should.
2731,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He sighed and trembled; then he crossed the floor,"
2732,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And gazed with eye abstracted on the sky;
2733,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Then came and looked at me; then turned,"
2734,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"As if affrighted at his springing thoughts,"
2735,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, with abruptest movement, left the room."
2736,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2737,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,This time he took with him the broidered thing
2738,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That I had wrought for him; and when I oped
2739,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The little purse that he rewarded me,"
2740,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I found full golden payment five times told.
2741,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Given for pity? thought I,--that alone?"
2742,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Is manly pity so munificent?
2743,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Pity has mixtures that it knows not of!
2744,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2745,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"It was a cruel triumph, and I speak"
2746,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Of it with utter penitence and shame.
2747,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I knew that he would come again; I knew
2748,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"His feet would bring him, though his soul rebelled;"
2749,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I knew that cheated heart of his would toy
2750,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"With the seductive chains that gave it thrall,"
2751,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And strive to reconcile its perjury
2752,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"With its own conscience of the better way,"
2753,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,By fabrication of apologies
2754,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,It knew were false.
2755,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2756,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And he did come again;
2757,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Confessing a strange interest in me,"
2758,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And doing for me many kindly deeds.
2759,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I knew the nature of the sympathy
2760,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That drew him to my side, better than he;"
2761,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Though I could see that solemn change in him
2762,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Which every face will wear, when Heaven and Hell"
2763,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Are struggling in the heart for mastery.
2764,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,He was unhappy; every sudden sound
2765,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Startled his apprehensions; from his heart
2766,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Rose heavy suspirations, charged with prayer,"
2767,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Desire, and deprecation, and remorse;--"
2768,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Sighs like volcanic breathings--sighs that scorched
2769,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"His parching lips and spread his face with ashes,--"
2770,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Sighs born in such convulsions of the soul
2771,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That his strong frame quaked like Vesuvius,"
2772,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Burdened with restless lava.
2773,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2774,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Day by day
2775,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I marked this dalliance with sinful thought,"
2776,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Without a throb of pity in my heart.
2777,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I took his gifts, which brought immunity"
2778,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"From toil and care, as if they were my right."
2779,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Day after day I saw my power increase,"
2780,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Until that noble spirit was a slave--
2781,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"A craven, helpless, self-suspected slave."
2782,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2783,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,But this was not to last--thank God and him!
2784,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"One night he came, and there had been a change."
2785,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"My hand was kindly taken, but not held"
2786,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,In the way wonted. He was self-possessed;
2787,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The powers of darkness and his Christian heart
2788,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Had had a struggle--his the victory;
2789,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And on his manly brow the benison
2790,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Of a majestic peace had been imposed.
2791,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Was I to lose the guerdon of my guile?
2792,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He was my all, and by the only means"
2793,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Left to a helpless, reckless thing, like me:"
2794,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,My heart made pledge the strife should be renewed.
2795,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I took no notice of his altered mood,"
2796,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"But strove, by all the tricks of tenderness,"
2797,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,To fan to life again the drooping flame
2798,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Within his heart;--with what success, at last,"
2799,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The sequel shall reveal.
2800,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2801,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Strange fire came down
2802,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Responsive to my call, and the quick flash"
2803,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That shriveled resolution, vanquished will,"
2804,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And with a blood-red flame consumed the crown
2805,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Of peace upon his brow, taught him how weak--"
2806,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"How miserably imbecile--he had become,"
2807,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Tampering with temptation. Such a groan,"
2808,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Wrung from such agony, as then he breathed,"
2809,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Pray Heaven my ears may never hear again!
2810,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He smote his forehead with his rigid palm,"
2811,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And sank, as if the blow had stunned him, to his knees,"
2812,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And there, with face pressed hard upon his hands"
2813,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Gave utterance to frenzied sobs and prayers--
2814,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The wild articulations of despair.
2815,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I was confounded. He--a man--thought I,"
2816,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Blind with remorse by simple look at sin!
2817,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And I--a woman--in the devil's hands,"
2818,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Luring him Hellward with no blush of shame!
2819,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The thought came swift from God, and pierced my heart,"
2820,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Like a barbed arrow; and it quivered there
2821,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Through whiles of tumult--quivered--and was fast.
2822,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Thus, while I stood and marked his kneeling form,"
2823,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Still shocked by deep convulsions, such a light"
2824,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Illumed my soul, and flooded all the room,"
2825,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That, without thought, I said, ""The Lord is here!"""
2826,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Then straight my spirit heard these wondrous words:
2827,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"""Tempted in all points like ourselves, was He--"
2828,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Tempted, but sinless."" Oh, what majesty"
2829,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Of meaning did those precious words convey!
2830,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"'Twas through temptation, thought I, that the Lord--"
2831,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The mediator between God and men--
2832,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Reached down the hand of sympathetic love
2833,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,To meet the grasp of lost Humanity;
2834,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And this man, kneeling, has the Lord in him,"
2835,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And comes to mediate 'twixt Christ and me,"
2836,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"""Tempted, but sinless;""--one hand grasping mine,"
2837,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The other Christ's.
2838,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2839,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Why had he suffered thus?
2840,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Why had his heart been led far down to mine,"
2841,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"To beat in sinful sympathy with mine,"
2842,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"But that my heart should cling to his and him,"
2843,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And follow his withdrawal to the heights
2844,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,From whence he had descended? Then I learned
2845,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Why Christ was tempted; and, as broad and full,"
2846,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"The heart of the great secret was revealed,"
2847,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And I perceived God's dealings with my soul,"
2848,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I knelt beside the tortured man and wept,"
2849,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And cried to Heaven for mercy. As I prayed,"
2850,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,My soul cast off its shameful enterprise;
2851,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And when it fell, I saw my godless self--"
2852,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"My own degraded, tainted, guilty heart,"
2853,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Which it had hidden from me. Oh, the pang--"
2854,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,The poignant throe of uttermost despair--
2855,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That followed the discovery! I felt
2856,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That I was lost beyond the grace of God;
2857,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And my heart turned with instinct sure and swift
2858,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"To the strong struggler, praying at my side,"
2859,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And begged his succor and his prayers. I felt
2860,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That he must lead me up to where the hand
2861,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Of Jesus could lay hold on me, or I was doomed."
2862,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Temptation's spell was past. He took my hand.
2863,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, as he prayed that we might be forgiven,"
2864,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And pledged our future loyalty to God
2865,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And His white throne within our hearts, I gave"
2866,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Responses to each promise; then I crowned
2867,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,His closing utterance with such Amen
2868,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"As weak hearts, conscious of their weakness, give"
2869,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"When, bowed to dust, and clinging to the robes"
2870,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Of outraged mercy, they devote themselves"
2871,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Once and for ever to the pitying Christ.
2872,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2873,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Then we arose and stood upon our feet.
2874,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"He gave me no reproaches, but with voice"
2875,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Attempered to his altered mood, confessed"
2876,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"His own blameworthiness, and pressed the prayer"
2877,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That I would pardon him, as he believed"
2878,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That God had pardoned; but my heart was full,--"
2879,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"So full of its sore sense of wrong to him,"
2880,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Of the deep guilt of shameful purposes
2881,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And treachery to worthy womanhood,"
2882,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That I could not repeat his Christian words,"
2883,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Asking forbearance on my own behalf.
2884,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2885,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,He sat before me for a golden hour;
2886,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And gave me counsel and encouragement,"
2887,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Till, like broad gates, the possibilities"
2888,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Of a serener and a higher life
2889,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Were thrown wide open to my eager feet,"
2890,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And I resolved that I would enter in,"
2891,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And, with God's gracious help, go no more out."
2892,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2893,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"For weeks he watched me with stern carefulness,"
2894,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Nourished my resolution, prayed with me,"
2895,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And led me, step by step, to higher ground,"
2896,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Till, gathering impulse in the upward walk,"
2897,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And strength in purer air, and keener sight"
2898,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"In the sweet light that dawned upon my soul,"
2899,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"I grasped the arm of Jesus, and was safe."
2900,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And now, when I look back upon my life,"
2901,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,It seems as if that noble man were sent
2902,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,To give me rescue from the pit of death.
2903,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,But from his distant height he could not reach
2904,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And act upon my soul; so Heaven allowed
2905,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Temptation's ladder 'twixt his soul and mine
2906,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,That they might meet and yield his mission thrift.
2907,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I doubt not in my grateful soul to-night
2908,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That had he stayed within his higher world,"
2909,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And tried to call me to him, I had spurned"
2910,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,Alike his mission and his ministry.
2911,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"That he was tempted, was at once my sin"
2912,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And my salvation. That he sinned in thought,"
2913,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And fiercely wrestled with temptation, won"
2914,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,For his own spirit that humility
2915,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Which God had sought to clothe him with in vain,"
2916,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"By other measures, and that strength which springs"
2917,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,From a great conflict and a victory.
2918,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,We talked of this; and on our bended knees
2919,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,We blessed the Great Dispenser for the means
2920,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"By which we both had learned our sinful selves,"
2921,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And found the way to a diviner life.
2922,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"So, with my chastened heart and life, I come"
2923,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Back to my home, to live--perhaps to die."
2924,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,God's love has been in all this discipline;
2925,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,God's love has used those awful sins of mine
2926,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,To make me good and happy. I can mourn
2927,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Over my husband; I can pray for him,"
2928,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Nay, I forgive him; for I know the power"
2929,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,With which temptation comes to stronger men.
2930,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,I know the power with which it came to me.
2931,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,
2932,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"And now, dear Grace, my story is complete."
2933,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"You have received it with dumb wonderment,"
2934,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,And it has been too long. Tell me what thought
2935,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY EXPERIENCE.,"Stirs in your face, and waits for utterance."

3242,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY STORY.,"So all of them had enough to eat,"

3319,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY STORY.,"And kept in his house a family tomb,"
3320,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY STORY.,"With his bowling course and his billiard-room,"
3321,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY STORY.,"Where he could preserve his precious dead,"
3322,THE QUESTION ILLUSTRATED BY STORY.,Who took the kiss of the bridal bed

3470,DENOUEMENT.,"Since the old gentleman retired to bed,"
3471,DENOUEMENT.,"Things have gone strangely. David, here, and Ruth,"
3472,DENOUEMENT.,Have wasted thirty minutes underground
3473,DENOUEMENT.,In explorations. One would think the house
3474,DENOUEMENT.,"Covered the entrance of the Mammoth Cave,"
3475,DENOUEMENT.,And they had lost themselves. Mary and Grace
3476,DENOUEMENT.,"Still hold their chamber and their conference,"
3477,DENOUEMENT.,And pour into each other's greedy ears
3478,DENOUEMENT.,"Their stream of talk, whose low monotonous hum,"
3479,DENOUEMENT.,Would lull to slumber any storm but this.
3480,DENOUEMENT.,The children are play-tired and gone to bed;
3481,DENOUEMENT.,And one may know by looking round the room
3482,DENOUEMENT.,"Their place of sport was here. And we, plain folk,"
3483,DENOUEMENT.,"Who have no gift of speech, especially"
3484,DENOUEMENT.,"On themes which we and none may understand,"
3485,DENOUEMENT.,"Have yawned and nodded in the great square room,"

3493,DENOUEMENT.,"If I remember rightly, you discuss"

3495,DENOUEMENT.,And pleasant tokens of intelligence;
3496,DENOUEMENT.,Rather preferring scanty company
3497,DENOUEMENT.,"To the full circle. So, sir, take the lead,"
3498,DENOUEMENT.,And help yourself.

3500,DENOUEMENT.,_John_.

3502,DENOUEMENT.,"Aye! That I will, and give"

3514,DENOUEMENT.,"O'erleaps the barrier, and comes drifting on"
3515,DENOUEMENT.,In lines as level as the window-bars.
3516,DENOUEMENT.,"What curious visions, in a night like this,"
3517,DENOUEMENT.,Will the eye conjure from the rocks and trees
3518,DENOUEMENT.,And zigzag fences! I was almost sure
3519,DENOUEMENT.,I saw a man staggering along the road
3520,DENOUEMENT.,A moment since; but instantly the shape
3521,DENOUEMENT.,Dropped from my sight. Hark! Was not that a call--
3522,DENOUEMENT.,A human voice? There's a conspiracy
3523,DENOUEMENT.,"Between my eyes and ears to play me tricks,"
3524,DENOUEMENT.,Else wanders there abroad some hapless soul
3525,DENOUEMENT.,"Who needs assistance. There he stands again,"
3526,DENOUEMENT.,And with unsteady essay strives to breast
3527,DENOUEMENT.,The tempest. Hush! Did you not hear that cry?
3528,DENOUEMENT.,"Quick, brothers! We must out, and give our aid."
3529,DENOUEMENT.,None but a dying and despairing man
3530,DENOUEMENT.,Ever gave utterance to a cry like that.

3541,DENOUEMENT.,
3542,DENOUEMENT.,Probably
3543,DENOUEMENT.,"Some neighbor, started from his home in quest"

3545,DENOUEMENT.,"Some poor inebriate, sadly overcome"
3546,DENOUEMENT.,By his sad keeping of the holiday.
3547,DENOUEMENT.,I hope they'll give him quarters in the barn;
3548,DENOUEMENT.,"If he sleep here, there'll be no sleep for me."
3549,DENOUEMENT.,
3550,DENOUEMENT.,_Patience_.
3551,DENOUEMENT.,
3552,DENOUEMENT.,I'll not believe it was a man at all;
3553,DENOUEMENT.,David and Ruth are always seeing things
3554,DENOUEMENT.,That no one else sees.
3555,DENOUEMENT.,
3556,DENOUEMENT.,_Ruth_.
3557,DENOUEMENT.,
3558,DENOUEMENT.,I see plainly now
3559,DENOUEMENT.,"What we shall all see plainly, soon enough."
3560,DENOUEMENT.,"The man is dead, and they are bearing him"
3561,DENOUEMENT.,"As if he were a log. Quick! Stir the fire,"
3562,DENOUEMENT.,And clear the settle! We must lay him there.
3563,DENOUEMENT.,"I will bring cordials, and flannel stuffs"
3564,DENOUEMENT.,With which to chafe him; open wide the door.
3565,DENOUEMENT.,
3566,DENOUEMENT.,[_The men enter bearing a body apparently

3571,DENOUEMENT.,"Now do my bidding, orderly and swift;"

3573,DENOUEMENT.,"Peter, relieve him of those frozen shoes,"
3574,DENOUEMENT.,"And wrap his feet in flannel. This way, Ruth!"
3575,DENOUEMENT.,Administer that cordial yourself.
3576,DENOUEMENT.,"John, you are strong, and that rough hand of yours"
3577,DENOUEMENT.,"Will chafe him well. Work with a will, I say!"

3590,DENOUEMENT.,_Ruth_.
3591,DENOUEMENT.,
3592,DENOUEMENT.,It is down at last!--
3593,DENOUEMENT.,A spoonful of the cordial. His breath
3594,DENOUEMENT.,"Comes feebly, but is warm upon my hand."
3595,DENOUEMENT.,
3596,DENOUEMENT.,_David_.
3597,DENOUEMENT.,
3598,DENOUEMENT.,"Give him brisk treatment, and persistent, too;"

3602,DENOUEMENT.,*       *       *       *       *

3606,DENOUEMENT.,*       *       *       *       *
3607,DENOUEMENT.,
3608,DENOUEMENT.,And now he opes his eyes.
3609,DENOUEMENT.,What eyes! How wandering and wild they are!
3610,DENOUEMENT.,
3611,DENOUEMENT.,[_To the stranger_.]
3612,DENOUEMENT.,
3613,DENOUEMENT.,We are your friends. We found you overcome

3627,DENOUEMENT.,_David_.
3628,DENOUEMENT.,
3629,DENOUEMENT.,"Poor man, how he raves!"
3630,DENOUEMENT.,Let us be silent while the warmth and wine
3631,DENOUEMENT.,"Provoke his sluggish blood to steady flow,"
3632,DENOUEMENT.,"And each dead sense comes back to life again,"
3633,DENOUEMENT.,O'er the same path of torture which it trod
3634,DENOUEMENT.,"When it went out from him. He'll slumber soon,"

3641,DENOUEMENT.,Shall I not call the family? I think

3661,DENOUEMENT.,At his first wild awaking he bemoaned

3709,DENOUEMENT.,But I had hoped to see her ere I died;
3710,DENOUEMENT.,"To kneel for pardon, and implore one kiss,"

3729,DENOUEMENT.,And let me die! Oh let me--let me die!
3730,DENOUEMENT.,Mary! my Mary! Could you only know
3731,DENOUEMENT.,How I have suffered since I fled from you.--
3732,DENOUEMENT.,"How I have sorrowed through long months of pain,"
3733,DENOUEMENT.,"And prayed for pardon,--you would pardon me."
3734,DENOUEMENT.,
3735,DENOUEMENT.,_David_.
3736,DENOUEMENT.,
3737,DENOUEMENT.,[_Sotto voce_]
3738,DENOUEMENT.,
3739,DENOUEMENT.,"Mary, what means this? Does he dream alone,"
3740,DENOUEMENT.,Or are we dreaming?
3741,DENOUEMENT.,
3742,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
3743,DENOUEMENT.,
3744,DENOUEMENT.,"Edward, I am here!"
3745,DENOUEMENT.,I am your Mary! Know you not my face?
3746,DENOUEMENT.,"My husband, speak to me! Oh, speak once more!"
3747,DENOUEMENT.,"This is no dream, but kind reality."
3748,DENOUEMENT.,
3749,DENOUEMENT.,_Edward_.
3750,DENOUEMENT.,
3751,DENOUEMENT.,"[_Raising himself, and looking wildly around_.]"
3752,DENOUEMENT.,
3753,DENOUEMENT.,"You, Mary? Is this heaven, and am I dead?"
3754,DENOUEMENT.,I did not know you died: when did you die?
3755,DENOUEMENT.,"And John and Peter, Grace and little Ruth"
3756,DENOUEMENT.,Grown to a woman; are they all with you?
3757,DENOUEMENT.,"'Tis very strange! O pity me, my friends!"
3758,DENOUEMENT.,"For God has pitied me, and pardoned, too;"
3759,DENOUEMENT.,"Else I should not be here. Nay, you seem cold,"
3760,DENOUEMENT.,And look on me with sad severity.
3761,DENOUEMENT.,Have you no pardoning word--no smile for me?
3762,DENOUEMENT.,
3763,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
3764,DENOUEMENT.,
3765,DENOUEMENT.,"This is not Heaven's, but Earth's reality;"
3766,DENOUEMENT.,This is the farm-house--these your wife and friends.
3767,DENOUEMENT.,"I hold your hand, and I forgive you all."
3768,DENOUEMENT.,Pray you recline! You are not strong enough
3769,DENOUEMENT.,To bear this yet.
3770,DENOUEMENT.,
3771,DENOUEMENT.,_Edward_.
3772,DENOUEMENT.,
3773,DENOUEMENT.,[_Sinking back_.]
3774,DENOUEMENT.,
3775,DENOUEMENT.,O toiling heart! O sick and sinking heart!
3776,DENOUEMENT.,"Give me one hour of service, ere I die!"
3777,DENOUEMENT.,"This is no dream. This hand is precious flesh,"
3778,DENOUEMENT.,And I am here where I have prayed to be.
3779,DENOUEMENT.,"My God, I thank thee! Thou hast heard my prayer,"
3780,DENOUEMENT.,"And, in its answer, given me a pledge"
3781,DENOUEMENT.,Of the acceptance of my penitence.
3782,DENOUEMENT.,How have I yearned for this one priceless hour!
3783,DENOUEMENT.,"Cling to me, dearest, while my feet go down"
3784,DENOUEMENT.,"Into the silent stream; nor loose your hold,"
3785,DENOUEMENT.,Till angels grasp me on the other side.
3786,DENOUEMENT.,
3787,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
3788,DENOUEMENT.,
3789,DENOUEMENT.,"Edward, you are not dying--must not die;"
3790,DENOUEMENT.,For only now are we prepared to live.
3791,DENOUEMENT.,"You must have quiet, and a night of rest."
3792,DENOUEMENT.,"Be silent, if you love me!"
3793,DENOUEMENT.,
3794,DENOUEMENT.,_Edward_.
3795,DENOUEMENT.,
3796,DENOUEMENT.,If I love?
3797,DENOUEMENT.,"Ah, Mary! never till this blessed hour,"
3798,DENOUEMENT.,"When power and passion, lust and pride are gone,"
3799,DENOUEMENT.,Have I perceived what wedded love may be;--
3800,DENOUEMENT.,"Unutterable fondness, soul for soul;"
3801,DENOUEMENT.,Profoundest tenderness between two hearts
3802,DENOUEMENT.,"Allied by nature, interlocked by life."
3803,DENOUEMENT.,I know that I shall die; but the low clouds
3804,DENOUEMENT.,"That closed my mental vision have retired,"
3805,DENOUEMENT.,And left a sky as clear and calm as Heaven.
3806,DENOUEMENT.,"I must talk now, or never more on earth;"
3807,DENOUEMENT.,So do not hinder me.
3808,DENOUEMENT.,
3809,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
3810,DENOUEMENT.,
3811,DENOUEMENT.,[_Weeping_.]
3812,DENOUEMENT.,
3813,DENOUEMENT.,Have you a wish
3814,DENOUEMENT.,That I can gratify? Have you any words
3815,DENOUEMENT.,To send to other friends?
3816,DENOUEMENT.,
3817,DENOUEMENT.,_Edward_.
3818,DENOUEMENT.,
3819,DENOUEMENT.,I have no friends
3820,DENOUEMENT.,"But you and these, and only wish to leave"
3821,DENOUEMENT.,My worthless name and memory redeemed
3822,DENOUEMENT.,Within your hearts to pitying respect.
3823,DENOUEMENT.,"I have no strength, and it becomes me not,"
3824,DENOUEMENT.,To tell the story of my life of sin.
3825,DENOUEMENT.,"I was a drunkard, thief, adulterer;"
3826,DENOUEMENT.,"And fled from shame, with shame, to find remorse."
3827,DENOUEMENT.,"I had but few months of debauchery,"
3828,DENOUEMENT.,Pursued with mad intent to damp or drown
3829,DENOUEMENT.,"The flames of a consuming conscience, when"
3830,DENOUEMENT.,"My body, poisoned, crippled with disease,"
3831,DENOUEMENT.,"Refused the guilty service of my soul,"
3832,DENOUEMENT.,And at midday fell prone upon the street.
3833,DENOUEMENT.,"Thence I was carried to a hospital,"
3834,DENOUEMENT.,And there I woke to that delirium
3835,DENOUEMENT.,Which none but drunkards this side of the pit
3836,DENOUEMENT.,May even dream of.
3837,DENOUEMENT.,
3838,DENOUEMENT.,"But at last there came,"
3839,DENOUEMENT.,"With abstinence and kindly medicines,"
3840,DENOUEMENT.,Release from pain and peaceful sanity;
3841,DENOUEMENT.,"And then Christ found me, ready for His hand."
3842,DENOUEMENT.,I was not ready for Him when He came
3843,DENOUEMENT.,And asked me for my youth; and when He knocked
3844,DENOUEMENT.,At my heart's door in manhood's early prime
3845,DENOUEMENT.,"With tenderest monitions, I debarred"
3846,DENOUEMENT.,His waiting feet with promise and excuse;
3847,DENOUEMENT.,"And when, in after years, absorbed in sin,"
3848,DENOUEMENT.,The gentle summons swelled to thunderings
3849,DENOUEMENT.,That echoed through the chambers of my soul
3850,DENOUEMENT.,"With threats of vengeance, I shut up my ears;"
3851,DENOUEMENT.,"And then He went away, and let me rush"
3852,DENOUEMENT.,"Without arrest, or protest, toward the pit."
3853,DENOUEMENT.,"I made swift passage downward, till, at length,"
3854,DENOUEMENT.,I had become a miserable wreck--
3855,DENOUEMENT.,Pleasure behind me; only pain before;
3856,DENOUEMENT.,"My life lived out; the fires of passion dead,"
3857,DENOUEMENT.,"Without a friend; no pride, no power, no hope;"
3858,DENOUEMENT.,No motive in me e'en to wish for life.
3859,DENOUEMENT.,"Then, as I said, Christ came, with stern and sad"
3860,DENOUEMENT.,"Reminders of His mercy and my guilt,"
3861,DENOUEMENT.,And the door fell before Him.
3862,DENOUEMENT.,
3863,DENOUEMENT.,"I went out,"
3864,DENOUEMENT.,And trod the wildernesses of remorse
3865,DENOUEMENT.,"For many days. Then from their outer verge,"
3866,DENOUEMENT.,"Tortured and blinded, I plunged madly down"
3867,DENOUEMENT.,Into the sullen bosom of despair;
3868,DENOUEMENT.,"But strength from Heaven was given me, and preserved"
3869,DENOUEMENT.,"Breath in my bosom, till a light streamed up"
3870,DENOUEMENT.,"Upon the other shore, and I struck out"
3871,DENOUEMENT.,"On the cold waters, struggling for my life."
3872,DENOUEMENT.,"Fainting I reached the beach, and on my knees"
3873,DENOUEMENT.,"Climbed up the thorny hill of penitence,"
3874,DENOUEMENT.,"Till I could see, upon its distant brow,"
3875,DENOUEMENT.,The Saviour beck'ning. Then I ran--I flew--
3876,DENOUEMENT.,And grasped His outstretched hand. It lifted me
3877,DENOUEMENT.,"High on the everlasting rock, and then"
3878,DENOUEMENT.,"It folded me, with all my griefs and tears,"
3879,DENOUEMENT.,"My sin-sick body and my guilt-stained soul,"
3880,DENOUEMENT.,To the great heart that throbs for all the world.
3881,DENOUEMENT.,
3882,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
3883,DENOUEMENT.,
3884,DENOUEMENT.,"Dear Lord, I bless Thee! Thou hast heard my prayer,"
3885,DENOUEMENT.,"And saved the wanderer! Hear it once again,"
3886,DENOUEMENT.,And lengthen out the life Thou hast redeemed!
3887,DENOUEMENT.,
3888,DENOUEMENT.,_Edward_.
3889,DENOUEMENT.,
3890,DENOUEMENT.,"Mary, my wife, forbear! I may not give"
3891,DENOUEMENT.,Response to such petition. I have prayed
3892,DENOUEMENT.,That I may die. When first the love Divine
3893,DENOUEMENT.,"Received me on its bosom, and in mine"
3894,DENOUEMENT.,"I felt the springing of another life,"
3895,DENOUEMENT.,I begged the Lord to grant me two requests:
3896,DENOUEMENT.,"The first that I might die, and in that world"
3897,DENOUEMENT.,"Where passion sleeps, and only influence"
3898,DENOUEMENT.,From Him and those who cluster at His throne
3899,DENOUEMENT.,"Breathes on the soul, the germ of His great life,"
3900,DENOUEMENT.,"Bursting within me, might be perfected."
3901,DENOUEMENT.,"The second, that your life, my love, and mine"
3902,DENOUEMENT.,Might be once more united on the earth
3903,DENOUEMENT.,"In holy marriage, and that mine might be"
3904,DENOUEMENT.,Breathed out at last within your loving arms.
3905,DENOUEMENT.,"One prayer is granted, and the other waits"
3906,DENOUEMENT.,But a brief space for its accomplishment.
3907,DENOUEMENT.,
3908,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
3909,DENOUEMENT.,
3910,DENOUEMENT.,"But why this prayer to die? Still loving me,--"
3911,DENOUEMENT.,With the great motive for desiring life
3912,DENOUEMENT.,"And the deep secret of enjoyment won,--"
3913,DENOUEMENT.,Why pray for death?
3914,DENOUEMENT.,
3915,DENOUEMENT.,_Edward_.
3916,DENOUEMENT.,
3917,DENOUEMENT.,"Do you not know me, Mary?"
3918,DENOUEMENT.,"I am afraid to live, for I am weak."
3919,DENOUEMENT.,I've found a treasure only life can steal;
3920,DENOUEMENT.,I've won a jewel only death will keep.
3921,DENOUEMENT.,"In such a heart as mine, the priceless pearl"
3922,DENOUEMENT.,Would not be safe. That which I would not take
3923,DENOUEMENT.,"When health was with me,--which I spurned away"
3924,DENOUEMENT.,"So long as I had power to sin, I fear"
3925,DENOUEMENT.,Would be surrendered with that power's return
3926,DENOUEMENT.,And the temptation to its exercise.
3927,DENOUEMENT.,"For soul like mine, diseased in every part,"
3928,DENOUEMENT.,There is but one condition in which grace
3929,DENOUEMENT.,May give it service. For my malady
3930,DENOUEMENT.,The Great Physician draws the blood away
3931,DENOUEMENT.,That only flows to feed its baleful fires;
3932,DENOUEMENT.,For only thus the balsam and the balm
3933,DENOUEMENT.,May touch the springs of healing.
3934,DENOUEMENT.,
3935,DENOUEMENT.,So I pray
3936,DENOUEMENT.,"To be delivered from myself,--to be"
3937,DENOUEMENT.,"Delivered from necessity of ill,--"
3938,DENOUEMENT.,To be secured from bringing harm to you.
3939,DENOUEMENT.,"Oh, what a boon is death to the sick soul!"
3940,DENOUEMENT.,I greet it with a joy that passes speech.
3941,DENOUEMENT.,"Were the whole world to come before me now,--"
3942,DENOUEMENT.,Wealth with its treasures; Pleasure with its cup;
3943,DENOUEMENT.,"Power robed in purple; Beauty in its pride,"
3944,DENOUEMENT.,And with Love's sweetest blossoms garlanded;
3945,DENOUEMENT.,"Fame with its bays, and Glory with its crown,--"
3946,DENOUEMENT.,"To tempt me lifeward, I would turn away,"
3947,DENOUEMENT.,And stretch my hands with utter eagerness
3948,DENOUEMENT.,"Toward the pale angel waiting for me now,"
3949,DENOUEMENT.,"And give my hand to him, to be led out,"
3950,DENOUEMENT.,"Serenely singing, to the land of shade."
3951,DENOUEMENT.,
3952,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
3953,DENOUEMENT.,
3954,DENOUEMENT.,"Edward, I yield you. I would not retain"
3955,DENOUEMENT.,"One who has strayed so long from God and heaven,"
3956,DENOUEMENT.,When his weak feet have found the only path
3957,DENOUEMENT.,Open for such as he.
3958,DENOUEMENT.,
3959,DENOUEMENT.,_Edward_.
3960,DENOUEMENT.,
3961,DENOUEMENT.,My strength recedes;
3962,DENOUEMENT.,"But ere it fail, tell me how fares your life."
3963,DENOUEMENT.,You have seen sorrow; but it comforts me
3964,DENOUEMENT.,To hear the language of a chastened soul
3965,DENOUEMENT.,From one perverted by my guilty hand.
3966,DENOUEMENT.,You speak the dialect of the redeemed--
3967,DENOUEMENT.,"The Heaven-accepted. Tell me it is so,"
3968,DENOUEMENT.,And you are happy.
3969,DENOUEMENT.,
3970,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
3971,DENOUEMENT.,
3972,DENOUEMENT.,With sweet hope and trust
3973,DENOUEMENT.,"I may reply, 'tis as you think and wish."
3974,DENOUEMENT.,"I have seen sorrow, surely, and the more"
3975,DENOUEMENT.,That I have seen what was far worse; but God
3976,DENOUEMENT.,Sent His own servant to me to restore
3977,DENOUEMENT.,My sadly straying feet to the sure path;
3978,DENOUEMENT.,And in my soul I have the pledge of grace
3979,DENOUEMENT.,Which shall suffice to keep them there.
3980,DENOUEMENT.,
3981,DENOUEMENT.,_Edward_.
3982,DENOUEMENT.,
3983,DENOUEMENT.,"Ah, joy!"
3984,DENOUEMENT.,"You found a friend; and my o'erflowing heart,"
3985,DENOUEMENT.,"Welling with gratitude, pours out to him"
3986,DENOUEMENT.,For his kind ministry its fitting meed.
3987,DENOUEMENT.,"Oh, breathe his name to me, that my poor lips"
3988,DENOUEMENT.,"May bind it to a benison, and that,"
3989,DENOUEMENT.,"While dying, I may whisper it with those--"
3990,DENOUEMENT.,Jesus and Mary--which I love the best.
3991,DENOUEMENT.,"Name him, I pray you."
3992,DENOUEMENT.,
3993,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
3994,DENOUEMENT.,
3995,DENOUEMENT.,You would ask of me
3996,DENOUEMENT.,"To bear your thanks to him, and to rehearse"
3997,DENOUEMENT.,Your dying words?
3998,DENOUEMENT.,
3999,DENOUEMENT.,_Grace_.
4000,DENOUEMENT.,
4001,DENOUEMENT.,He asks your good friend's name;
4002,DENOUEMENT.,You do not understand him.
4003,DENOUEMENT.,
4004,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
4005,DENOUEMENT.,
4006,DENOUEMENT.,It is hard
4007,DENOUEMENT.,To give denial to a dying wish;
4008,DENOUEMENT.,"But, Edward, I've no right to speak his name."
4009,DENOUEMENT.,"He was a Christian man, and you may give"
4010,DENOUEMENT.,Of the full largess of your gratitude
4011,DENOUEMENT.,"All, without robbing God, you have to give,"
4012,DENOUEMENT.,"And fail, e'en then, of worthy recompense."
4013,DENOUEMENT.,
4014,DENOUEMENT.,_Edward_.
4015,DENOUEMENT.,
4016,DENOUEMENT.,Your will is mine.
4017,DENOUEMENT.,
4018,DENOUEMENT.,_Grace_.
4019,DENOUEMENT.,
4020,DENOUEMENT.,"Nay, Mary, tell it him!"
4021,DENOUEMENT.,Where is he going he should bruit the name?
4022,DENOUEMENT.,"Remember where he lies, and that no ears"
4023,DENOUEMENT.,Save those of angels--
4024,DENOUEMENT.,
4025,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
4026,DENOUEMENT.,
4027,DENOUEMENT.,There are others here
4028,DENOUEMENT.,Who may not hear it.
4029,DENOUEMENT.,
4030,DENOUEMENT.,_Ruth_.
4031,DENOUEMENT.,
4032,DENOUEMENT.,We will all retire.
4033,DENOUEMENT.,"It is not proper we should linger here,"
4034,DENOUEMENT.,Barring the sacred confidence of hearts
4035,DENOUEMENT.,Parting so sadly.
4036,DENOUEMENT.,
4037,DENOUEMENT.,_David_.
4038,DENOUEMENT.,
4039,DENOUEMENT.,"Mary, you must yield,"
4040,DENOUEMENT.,"Nor keep the secret longer from your friends,"
4041,DENOUEMENT.,
4042,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
4043,DENOUEMENT.,
4044,DENOUEMENT.,"David, you know not what you say."
4045,DENOUEMENT.,
4046,DENOUEMENT.,_David_.
4047,DENOUEMENT.,
4048,DENOUEMENT.,I know;
4049,DENOUEMENT.,So give the dying man no more delay.
4050,DENOUEMENT.,
4051,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
4052,DENOUEMENT.,
4053,DENOUEMENT.,I will declare it under your command.
4054,DENOUEMENT.,This stranger friend--stranger for many months--
4055,DENOUEMENT.,"This man, selectest instrument of Heaven,"
4056,DENOUEMENT.,"Who gave me succor in my hour of need,"
4057,DENOUEMENT.,"Snatched me from ruin, rescued me from want,"
4058,DENOUEMENT.,"Counseled and cheered me, prayed with me, and then"
4059,DENOUEMENT.,"Led me with careful hand into the light,"
4060,DENOUEMENT.,Was he now bending over you in tears--
4061,DENOUEMENT.,"David, my brother!"
4062,DENOUEMENT.,
4063,DENOUEMENT.,_Edward_.
4064,DENOUEMENT.,
4065,DENOUEMENT.,Blessed be his name!
4066,DENOUEMENT.,"Brother by every law, above--below!"
4067,DENOUEMENT.,
4068,DENOUEMENT.,_Grace_.
4069,DENOUEMENT.,
4070,DENOUEMENT.,"[_Pale and trembling_,]"
4071,DENOUEMENT.,
4072,DENOUEMENT.,David? My husband? Did I hear aright?
4073,DENOUEMENT.,You are not jesting! Sure you would not jest
4074,DENOUEMENT.,"At such a juncture! Speak, my husband, speak!"
4075,DENOUEMENT.,"Is this a plot to cheat a dying man,"
4076,DENOUEMENT.,"Or cheat a wife who, if it be no plot,"
4077,DENOUEMENT.,Is worthy death? What can you mean by this?
4078,DENOUEMENT.,
4079,DENOUEMENT.,_Mary_.
4080,DENOUEMENT.,
4081,DENOUEMENT.,Not more nor less than my true words convey.
4082,DENOUEMENT.,
4083,DENOUEMENT.,_Grace_.
4084,DENOUEMENT.,
4085,DENOUEMENT.,"Nay, David, tell me!"
4086,DENOUEMENT.,
4087,DENOUEMENT.,_David_.
4088,DENOUEMENT.,
4089,DENOUEMENT.,Mary's words are truth.
4090,DENOUEMENT.,_Grace_.
4091,DENOUEMENT.,
4092,DENOUEMENT.,"O mean and jealous heart, what hast thou done!"
4093,DENOUEMENT.,"What wrong to honor, spite to Christian love,"
4094,DENOUEMENT.,And shame to self beyond self-pardoning!
4095,DENOUEMENT.,How can I ever lift my faithless eyes
4096,DENOUEMENT.,To those true eyes that I have counted false;
4097,DENOUEMENT.,Or meet those lips that I have charged with lies;
4098,DENOUEMENT.,Or win the dear embraces I have spurned?
4099,DENOUEMENT.,"O most unhappy, most unworthy wife!"
4100,DENOUEMENT.,"No one but he who still has clung to thee,--"
4101,DENOUEMENT.,"Proud, and imperious, and impenitent,--"
4102,DENOUEMENT.,No one but he who has in silence borne
4103,DENOUEMENT.,Thy peevish criminations and complaints
4104,DENOUEMENT.,"Can now forgive thee, when in deepest shame"
4105,DENOUEMENT.,Thou bowest with confession of thy faults.
4106,DENOUEMENT.,Dear husband! David! Look upon your wife!
4107,DENOUEMENT.,Behold one kneeling never knelt to you!
4108,DENOUEMENT.,"I have abused you and your faithful love,"
4109,DENOUEMENT.,"And, in my great humiliation, pray"
4110,DENOUEMENT.,You will not trample me beneath your feet.
4111,DENOUEMENT.,"Pity my weakness, and remember, too,"
4112,DENOUEMENT.,"That Love was jealous of thee, and not Hate--"
4113,DENOUEMENT.,That it was Love's own pride tormented me.
4114,DENOUEMENT.,"My husband, take me once more to your arms,"
4115,DENOUEMENT.,And kiss me in forgiveness; say that you
4116,DENOUEMENT.,"Will be my counselor, my friend, my love;"
4117,DENOUEMENT.,"And I will give myself to you again,"
4118,DENOUEMENT.,"To be all yours--my reason, confidence,"
4119,DENOUEMENT.,"My faith and trust all yours, my heart's best love,"
4120,DENOUEMENT.,"My service and my prayers, all yours--all yours!"
4121,DENOUEMENT.,
4122,DENOUEMENT.,_David_.
4123,DENOUEMENT.,
4124,DENOUEMENT.,"Rise, dearest, rise! It gives me only pain"
4125,DENOUEMENT.,That such as you should kneel to such as I.
4126,DENOUEMENT.,Your words inform me that you know how weak
4127,DENOUEMENT.,I am whom you have only fancied weak.
4128,DENOUEMENT.,Forgive you? I forgive you everything;
4129,DENOUEMENT.,And take the pardon which your prayer insures.
4130,DENOUEMENT.,"Let this embrace, this kiss, be evidence"
4131,DENOUEMENT.,"Our jarring hearts catch common rhythm again,"
4132,DENOUEMENT.,And we are lovers.
4133,DENOUEMENT.,
4134,DENOUEMENT.,_Ruth_.
4135,DENOUEMENT.,
4136,DENOUEMENT.,Hush! You trouble him.
4137,DENOUEMENT.,He understands this scene no more than we.
4138,DENOUEMENT.,"Mary, he speaks to you."
4139,DENOUEMENT.,
4140,DENOUEMENT.,_Edward_.
4141,DENOUEMENT.,
4142,DENOUEMENT.,"Dear wife, farewell!"
4143,DENOUEMENT.,"The room grows dim, and silently and soft"
4144,DENOUEMENT.,"The veil is dropping 'twixt my eyes and yours,"
4145,DENOUEMENT.,Which soon will hide me from you--you from me.
4146,DENOUEMENT.,"Only one hand is warm; it rests in yours,"
4147,DENOUEMENT.,"Whose full, sweet pulses throb along my arm,"
4148,DENOUEMENT.,So that I live upon them. Cling to me!
4149,DENOUEMENT.,"And thus your life, after my life is past,"
4150,DENOUEMENT.,Shall lay me gently in the arms of Death.
4151,DENOUEMENT.,Thus shall you link your being with a soul
4152,DENOUEMENT.,Gazing unveiled upon the Great White Throne.
4153,DENOUEMENT.,
4154,DENOUEMENT.,"Dear hearts of love surrounding me, farewell!"
4155,DENOUEMENT.,"I cannot see you now; or, if I do,"
4156,DENOUEMENT.,You are transfigured. There are floating forms
4157,DENOUEMENT.,That whisper over me like summer leaves;
4158,DENOUEMENT.,"And now there comes, and spreads through all my soul."
4159,DENOUEMENT.,"Delicious influx of another life,"
4160,DENOUEMENT.,"From out whose essence spring, like living flowers,"
4161,DENOUEMENT.,"Angelic senses with quick ultimates,"
4162,DENOUEMENT.,"That catch the rustle of ethereal robes,"
4163,DENOUEMENT.,And the thin chime of melting minstrelsy--
4164,DENOUEMENT.,Rising and falling--answered far away--
4165,DENOUEMENT.,"As Echo, dreaming in the twilight woods,"
4166,DENOUEMENT.,Repeats the warble of her twilight birds.
4167,DENOUEMENT.,And flowers that mock the Iris toss their cups
4168,DENOUEMENT.,"In the impulsive ether, and spill out"
4169,DENOUEMENT.,"Sweet tides of perfume, fragrant deluges,"
4170,DENOUEMENT.,Flooding my spirit like an angel's breath.

4172,DENOUEMENT.,*       *       *       *       *
4173,DENOUEMENT.,
4174,DENOUEMENT.,And still the throng increases; still unfold
4175,DENOUEMENT.,With broader span and more elusive sweep
4176,DENOUEMENT.,The radiant vistas of a world divine.
4177,DENOUEMENT.,But O my soul! what vision rises now!
4178,DENOUEMENT.,"Far, far away, white blazing like the sun,"
4179,DENOUEMENT.,"In deepest distance and on highest height,"
4180,DENOUEMENT.,"Through walls diaphanous, and atmosphere"
4181,DENOUEMENT.,"Flecked with unnumbered forms of missive power,"
4182,DENOUEMENT.,"Out-going fleetly and returning slow,"
4183,DENOUEMENT.,A Presence shines I may not penetrate;
4184,DENOUEMENT.,"But on a throne, with smile ineffable,"
4185,DENOUEMENT.,I see a form my conscious spirit knows.
4186,DENOUEMENT.,"Jesus, my Saviour! Jesus, Lamb of God!"
4187,DENOUEMENT.,"Jesus who taketh from me all my sins,"
4188,DENOUEMENT.,"And from the world! Jesus, I come to thee!"
4189,DENOUEMENT.,"Come thou to me! O come, Lord, quickly! Come!"
4190,DENOUEMENT.,
4191,DENOUEMENT.,_David_.
4192,DENOUEMENT.,
4193,DENOUEMENT.,Flown on the wings of rapture! Is this death?
4194,DENOUEMENT.,His heart is still; his beaded brow is cold;
4195,DENOUEMENT.,His wasted breast struggles for breath no more;
4196,DENOUEMENT.,"And his pale features, hardened with the stress"
4197,DENOUEMENT.,"Of Life's resistance, momently subside"
4198,DENOUEMENT.,"Into a smile, calm as a twilight lake,"
4199,DENOUEMENT.,"Sprent with the images of rising stars,"
4200,DENOUEMENT.,We have seen Evil in his countless forms
4201,DENOUEMENT.,In these poor lives; have met his armed hosts
4202,DENOUEMENT.,In dread encounter and discomfiture;
4203,DENOUEMENT.,"And languished in captivity to them,"
4204,DENOUEMENT.,Until we lost our courage and our faith;
4205,DENOUEMENT.,And here we see their Chieftain--Terror's King!
4206,DENOUEMENT.,He cuts the knot that binds a weary soul
4207,DENOUEMENT.,"To faithless passions, sateless appetites,"
4208,DENOUEMENT.,"And powers perverted, and it flies away"
4209,DENOUEMENT.,"Singing toward heaven. He turns and looks at us,"
4210,DENOUEMENT.,And finds us weeping with our gratitude--
4211,DENOUEMENT.,"Full of sweet sorrow,--sorrow sweeter far"
4212,DENOUEMENT.,Than the supremest ecstasy of joy.
4213,DENOUEMENT.,
4214,DENOUEMENT.,And this is death! Think you that raptured soul
4215,DENOUEMENT.,"Now walking humbly in the golden streets,"
4216,DENOUEMENT.,Bearing the precious burden of a love
4217,DENOUEMENT.,"Too great for utterance, or with hushed heart"
4218,DENOUEMENT.,"Drinking the music of the ransomed throng,"
4219,DENOUEMENT.,"Counts death an evil?--evil, sickness, pain,"
4220,DENOUEMENT.,"Calamity, or aught that God prescribed"
4221,DENOUEMENT.,"To cure it of its sin, or bring it where"
4222,DENOUEMENT.,The healing hand of Christ might touch it? No!
4223,DENOUEMENT.,He is a man to-night--a man in Christ.
4224,DENOUEMENT.,"This was his childhood, here; and as we give"
4225,DENOUEMENT.,A smile of wonder to the little woes
4226,DENOUEMENT.,"That drew the tears from out our own young eyes,"
4227,DENOUEMENT.,The kind corrections and severe constraints
4228,DENOUEMENT.,Imposed by those who loved us--so he sees
4229,DENOUEMENT.,A father's chastisement in all the ill
4230,DENOUEMENT.,That filled his life with darkness; so he sees
4231,DENOUEMENT.,In every evil a kind instrument
4232,DENOUEMENT.,"To chasten, elevate, correct, subdue,"
4233,DENOUEMENT.,And fit him for that heavenly estate--
4234,DENOUEMENT.,Saintship in Christ--the Manhood Absolute!

4243,L'ENVOY.,"The broad, full moon is shining, with the stars."
4244,L'ENVOY.,"On mount and valley, forest, roof, and rock,"
4245,L'ENVOY.,"On billowy hills smooth-stretching to the sky,"
4246,L'ENVOY.,"On rail and wall, on all things far and near,"
4247,L'ENVOY.,"Cling the bright crystals,--all the earth a floor"
4248,L'ENVOY.,"Of polished silver, pranked with bending forms"
4249,L'ENVOY.,Uplifting to the light their precious weight
4250,L'ENVOY.,"Of pearls and diamonds, set in palest gold."
4251,L'ENVOY.,The storm is dead; and when it rolled away
4252,L'ENVOY.,"It took no star from heaven, but left to earth"
4253,L'ENVOY.,Such legacy of beauty as The Wind--
4254,L'ENVOY.,The light-robed shepherdess from Cuban groves--
4255,L'ENVOY.,"Driving soft showers before her, and warm airs,"
4256,L'ENVOY.,"And her wide-scattered flocks of wet-winged birds,"
4257,L'ENVOY.,Never bestowed upon the waiting Spring.
4258,L'ENVOY.,"Pale, silent, smiling, cold, and beautiful!"
4259,L'ENVOY.,Do storms die thus? And is it this to die?
4260,L'ENVOY.,
4261,L'ENVOY.,Midnight and silence! In that hallowed room
4262,L'ENVOY.,"God's full-orbed peace is shining, with the stars."
4263,L'ENVOY.,"On head and hand, on brow, and lip, and eye,"
4264,L'ENVOY.,"On folded arms, on broad unmoving breast,"
4265,L'ENVOY.,"On the white-sanded floor, on everything"
4266,L'ENVOY.,"Rest the pale radiance, while bending forms"
4267,L'ENVOY.,"Stand all around, loaded with precious weight"
4268,L'ENVOY.,Of jewels such as holy angels wear.
4269,L'ENVOY.,The man is dead; and when he passed away
4270,L'ENVOY.,"He blotted out no good, but left behind"
4271,L'ENVOY.,"Such wealth of faith, such store of love and trust,"
4272,L'ENVOY.,"As breath of joy, in-floating from the isles"
4273,L'ENVOY.,"Smiled on by ceaseless summer, and indued"
4274,L'ENVOY.,"With foliage and flowers perennial,"
4275,L'ENVOY.,Never conveyed to the enchanted soul.
4276,L'ENVOY.,Do men die thus? And is it this to die?
4277,L'ENVOY.,
4278,L'ENVOY.,"Midnight and silence! At each waiting tied,"
4279,L'ENVOY.,"Husband and wife, embracing, kneel in prayer;"
4280,L'ENVOY.,And lips unused to such a benison
4281,L'ENVOY.,"Breathe blessings upon evil, and give thanks"
4282,L'ENVOY.,For knowledge of its sacred ministry.
4283,L'ENVOY.,"An infant nestles on a mother's breast,"
4284,L'ENVOY.,Whose head is pillowed where it has not lain
4285,L'ENVOY.,"For months of wasted life--the tale all told,"
4286,L'ENVOY.,And confidence and love for aye secure.
4287,L'ENVOY.,
4288,L'ENVOY.,The widow and the virgin: where are they?
4289,L'ENVOY.,"The morn shall find them watching with the dead,"

4291,L'ENVOY.,"One at the head, the other at the foot,--"
