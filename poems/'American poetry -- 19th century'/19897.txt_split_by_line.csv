137,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE
138,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
139,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"As one who cons at evening o'er an album all alone,"
140,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known,"
141,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"So I turn the leaves of fancy till, in shadowy design,"
142,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine.
143,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
144,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise,"
145,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"As I turn it low to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes,"
146,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And light my pipe in silence, save a sigh that seems to yoke"
147,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke.
148,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
149,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Tis a fragrant retrospection--for the loving thoughts that start
150,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Into being are like perfume from the blossom of the heart;
151,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine--
152,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,When my truant fancy wanders with that old sweetheart of mine.
153,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
154,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Though I hear, beneath my study, like a fluttering of wings,"
155,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"The voices of my children, and the mother as she sings,"
156,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me any theme
157,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,When Care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dream.
158,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
159,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
160,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,[Illustration]
161,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
162,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
163,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"In fact, to speak in earnest, I believe it adds a charm"
164,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm--
165,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,For I find an extra flavor in Memory's mellow wine
166,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine.
167,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
168,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"A face of lily-beauty, with a form of airy grace."
169,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Floats out of my tobacco as the genii from the vase;
170,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes
171,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies.
172,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
173,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,I can see the pink sunbonnet and the little checkered dress
174,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,She wore when first I kissed her and she answered the caress
175,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"With the written declaration that, ""as surely as the vine"
176,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Grew round the stump,"" she loved me--that old sweetheart of mine."
177,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
178,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand,"
179,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,As we used to talk together of the future we had planned--
180,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"When I should be a poet, and with nothing else to do"
181,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,But write the tender verses that she set the music to:
182,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
183,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,When we should live together in a cozy little cot
184,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Hid in a nest of roses, with a fairy garden-spot,"
185,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Where the vines were ever fruited, and the weather ever fine,"
186,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine:
187,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
188,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"When I should be her lover forever and a day,"
189,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray;
190,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And we should be so happy that when either's lips were dumb
191,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,They would not smile in Heaven till the other's kiss had come.

201,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And the door is softly opened, and--my wife is standing there;"
202,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Yet with eagerness and rapture all my visions I resign
203,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,To greet the living presence of that old sweetheart of mine.

240,A' OLD PLAYED-OUT SONG,"How her face used to look, in the twilight,"

289,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO
290,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
291,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,How tired I am! I sink down all alone
292,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Here by the wayside of the Present. Lo,"
293,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Even as a child I hide my face and moan--
294,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,A little girl that may no farther go;
295,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,The path above me only seems to grow
296,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"More rugged, climbing still, and ever briered"
297,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,With keener thorns of pain than these below;
298,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And O the bleeding feet that falter so
299,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And are so very tired!
300,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
301,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Why, I have journeyed from the far-off Lands"
302,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Of Babyhood--where baby-lilies blew
303,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Their trumpets in mine ears, and filled my hands"
304,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"With treasures of perfume and honey-dew,"
305,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And where the orchard shadows ever drew
306,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Their cool arms round me when my cheeks were fired
307,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"With too much joy, and lulled mine eyelids to,"
308,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And only let the starshine trickle through
309,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"In sprays, when I was tired!"
310,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
311,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Yet I remember, when the butterfly"
312,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Went flickering about me like a flame
313,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"That quenched itself in roses suddenly,"
314,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"How oft I wished that _I_ might blaze the same,"
315,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And in some rose-wreath nestle with my name,"
316,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,While all the world looked on it and admired.--
317,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Poor moth!--Along my wavering flight toward fame
318,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"The winds drive backward, and my wings are lame"
319,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And broken, bruised and tired!"
320,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
321,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I hardly know the path from those old times;
322,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I know at first it was a smoother one
323,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Than this that hurries past me now, and climbs"
324,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"So high, its far cliffs even hide the sun"
325,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And shroud in gloom my journey scarce begun.
326,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I could not do quite all the world required--
327,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"I could not do quite all I should have done,"
328,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And in my eagerness I have outrun
329,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,My strength--and I am tired....
330,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
331,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Just tired! But when of old I had the stay
332,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Of mother-hands, O very sweet indeed"
333,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,It was to dream that all the weary way
334,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I should but follow where I now must lead--
335,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"For long ago they left me in my need,"
336,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And, groping on alone, I tripped and mired"
337,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Among rank grasses where the serpents breed
338,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,In knotted coils about the feet of speed.--
339,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,There first it was I tired.
340,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
341,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And yet I staggered on, and bore my load"
342,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Right gallantly: The sun, in summer-time,"
343,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,In lazy belts came slipping down the road
344,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"To woo me on, with many a glimmering rhyme"
345,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Rained from the golden rim of some fair clime,"
346,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"That, hovering beyond the clouds, inspired"
347,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,My failing heart with fancies so sublime
348,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"I half forgot my path of dust and grime,"
349,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Though I was growing tired.
350,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
351,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And there were many voices cheering me:
352,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I listened to sweet praises where the wind
353,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Went laughing o'er my shoulders gleefully
354,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And scattering my love-songs far behind;--
355,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Until, at last, I thought the world so kind--"
356,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,So rich in all my yearning soul desired--

374,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,

384,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
385,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"For, O my friends, to lose the latest grasp--"
386,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,To feel the last hope slipping from its hold--
387,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,To feel the one fond hand within your clasp
388,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Fall slack, and loosen with a touch so cold"
389,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Its pressure may not warm you as of old
390,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Before the light of love had thus expired--
391,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"To know your tears are worthless, though they rolled"
392,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Their torrents out in molten drops of gold.--
393,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,God's pity! I am tired!
394,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
395,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And I must rest.--Yet do not say ""She _died_,"""
396,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"In speaking of me, sleeping here alone."

494,I,And she so loved the sunshine and the sky!--
495,I,She loved them even better yet than I
496,I,"That ne'er knew dearth of them--my mother dead,"
497,I,Nature had nursed me in her lap instead:
498,I,And I had grown a dark and eerie child
499,I,"That rarely smiled,"
500,I,"Save when, shut all alone in grasses high,"
501,I,Looking straight up in God's great lonesome sky
502,I,And coaxing Mother to smile back on me.
503,I,"'Twas lying thus, this fair girl suddenly"
504,I,"Came to me, nestled in the fields beside"
505,I,"A pleasant-seeming home, with doorway wide--"

510,I,Within my throat so gripped it I could make
511,I,"No sound but a thick sobbing. Cowering so,"
512,I,I felt her light hand laid
513,I,Upon my hair--a touch that ne'er before
514,I,"Had tamed me thus, all soothed and unafraid--"
515,I,It seemed the touch the children used to know
516,I,"When Christ was here, so dear it was--so dear,--"
517,I,At once I loved her as the leaves love dew
518,I,In midmost summer when the days are new.
519,I,"Barely an hour I knew her, yet a curl"
520,I,Of silken sunshine did she clip for me
521,I,"Out of the bright May-morning of her hair,"
522,I,"And bound and gave it to me laughingly,"
523,I,"And caught my hands and called me _""Little girl,""_"

526,I,Of my great happiness.
527,I,"She plucked me by the gown, nor saw how mean"
528,I,The raiment--drew me with her everywhere:
529,I,Smothered her face in tufts of grasses green:

544,I,"And we did mingle like to these, and thus,"
545,I,"Together, made"
546,I,"The perfect summer, pure and glorious."
547,I,"So blent we, till a harsh voice broke upon"
548,I,"Our happiness.--She, startled as a fawn,"
549,I,"Cried, ""Oh, 'tis Father!""--all the blossoms gone"

551,I,Harsher the voice came:--She could only gasp
552,I,"Affrightedly, ""Good-bye!--good-bye! good-bye!"""
553,I,"And lo, I stood alone, with that harsh cry"
554,I,Ringing a new and unknown sense of shame
555,I,"Through soul and frame,"

564,II,"I thought no little sallow star, alone"
565,II,"In all a world of twilight, e'er had known"
566,II,Such utter loneliness. But that I wore
567,II,Above my heart that gleaming tress of hair
568,II,"To lighten up the night of my despair,"
569,II,I think I might have groped into my grave
570,II,Nor cared to wave
571,II,The ferns above it with a breath of prayer.
572,II,"And how I hungered for the sweet, sweet face"
573,II,That bent above me in my hiding-place
574,II,That day amid the grasses there beside
575,II,"Her pleasant home!--""Her _pleasant_ home!"" I sighed,"
576,II,Remembering;--then shut my teeth and feigned
577,II,"The harsh voice calling _me_,--then clinched my nails"
578,II,"So deeply in my palms, the sharp wounds pained,"
579,II,"And tossed my face toward heaven, as one who pales"

589,II,Wherein the tempest-beaten heart might ride
590,II,"Sometimes at peaceful anchor, and abide"
591,II,"Where those that loved me touched me with their hands,"
592,II,"And looked upon me with glad eyes, and slipped"
593,II,"Smooth fingers o'er my brow, and lulled the strands"
594,II,"Of my wild tresses, as they backward tipped"
595,II,My yearning face and kissed it satisfied.

606,III,Was I to look upon her face again;--
607,III,At last--at last--half conscious where my feet
608,III,"Were faring, I stood waist-deep in the sweet"
609,III,Green grasses there where she
610,III,First came to me.--
611,III,"The very blossoms she had plucked that day,"
612,III,"And, at her father's voice, had cast away,"
613,III,"Around me lay,"
614,III,Still bright and blooming in these eyes of mine;
615,III,"And as I gathered each one eagerly,"
616,III,I pressed it to my lips and drank the wine
617,III,Her kisses left there for the honey-bee.
618,III,"Then, after I had laid them with the tress"
619,III,"Of her bright hair with lingering tenderness,"
620,III,"I, turning, crept on to the hedge that bound"
621,III,Her pleasant-seeming home--but all around
622,III,Was never sign of her!--The windows all
623,III,Were blinded; and I heard no rippling fall
624,III,"Of her glad laugh, nor any harsh voice call;--"
625,III,"But clutching to the tangled grasses, caught"
626,III,A sound as though a strong man bowed his head
627,III,And sobbed alone--unloved--uncomforted!--
628,III,And then straightway before
629,III,"My tearless eyes, all vividly, was wrought"
630,III,A vision that is with me evermore:--
631,III,"A little girl that lies asleep, nor hears"
632,III,Nor heeds not any voice nor fall of tears.--

2035,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2036,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2037,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,Then I went to work in airnest--I had nothin' much in view
2038,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"But to drownd out rickollections--and it kep' me busy, too!"
2039,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"But I slowly thrived and prospered, tel Mother used to say"
2040,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,She expected yit to see me a wealthy man some day.
2041,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2042,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"Then I'd think how little _money_ was, compared to happiness--"
2043,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,And who'd be left to use it when I died I couldn't guess!
2044,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"But I've still kep' speculatin' and a-gainin' year by year,"
2045,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"Tel I'm payin' half the taxes in the county, mighty near!"
2046,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2047,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"Well!--A year ago er better, a letter comes to hand"
2048,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,Astin' how I'd like to dicker fer some Illinois land--

2050,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"""Had jest deceased, insolvent, leavin' chance to speculate,""--"
2051,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2052,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"And then it closed by sayin' that I'd ""better come and see.""--"
2053,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"I'd never been West, anyhow--a most too wild fer _me_"
2054,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,I'd allus had a notion; but a lawyer here in town
2055,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,Said I'd find myself mistakened when I come to look around.
2056,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2057,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"So I bids good-bye to Mother, and I jumps aboard the train,"
2058,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,A-thinkin' what I'd bring her when I come back home again--
2059,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"And ef she'd had an idy what the present was to be,"
2060,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,I think it's more'n likely she'd a-went along with me!
2061,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2062,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"Cars is awful tejus ridin', fer all they go so fast!"
2063,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,But finally they called out my stoppin'-place at last;
2064,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"And that night, at the tavern, I dreamp' _I_ was a train"
2065,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"O' cars, and _skeered_ at sompin', runnin' down a country lane!"
2066,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2067,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"Well, in the mornin' airly--after huntin' up the man--"
2068,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,The lawyer who was wantin' to swap the piece o' land--
2069,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,We started fer the country; and I ast the history
2070,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"Of the farm--its former owner--and so-forth, etcetery!"
2071,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2072,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"And--well--it was inte_rest_in'--I su'prised him, I suppose,"
2073,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,By the loud and frequent manner in which I blowed my nose!--
2074,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"But his surprise was greater, and it made him wonder more,"
2075,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,When I kissed and hugged the widder when she met us at the door!--
2076,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2077,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,_It was Mary:_ They's a feelin' a-hidin' down in here--

2079,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"It was with us in that meetin', I don't want you to fergit!"
2080,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,And it makes me kind o' nervous when I think about it yit!
2081,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2082,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"I _bought_ that farm, and _deeded_ it, afore I left the town,"
2083,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"With ""title clear to mansions in the skies,"" to Mary Brown!"
2084,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"And fu'thermore, I took her and _the childern_--fer, you see,"
2085,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,They'd never seed their Grandma--and I fetched 'em home with me.
2086,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,

2097,THE ROSE,THE ROSE
2098,THE ROSE,
2099,THE ROSE,It tossed its head at the wooing breeze;
2100,THE ROSE,"And the sun, like a bashful swain,"
2101,THE ROSE,Beamed on it through the waving trees
2102,THE ROSE,"With a passion all in vain,--"
2103,THE ROSE,"For my rose laughed in a crimson glee,"
2104,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
2105,THE ROSE,
2106,THE ROSE,The honey-bee came there to sing
2107,THE ROSE,"His love through the languid hours,"
2108,THE ROSE,"And vaunt of his hives, as a proud old king"
2109,THE ROSE,Might boast of his palace-towers:
2110,THE ROSE,"But my rose bowed in a mockery,"
2111,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
2112,THE ROSE,
2113,THE ROSE,"The humming-bird, like a courtier gay,"
2114,THE ROSE,"Dipped down with a dalliant song,"
2115,THE ROSE,And twanged his wings through the roundelay
2116,THE ROSE,Of love the whole day long:
2117,THE ROSE,Yet my rose returned from his minstrelsy
2118,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
2119,THE ROSE,
2120,THE ROSE,The firefly came in the twilight dim
2121,THE ROSE,"My red, red rose to woo--"
2122,THE ROSE,Till quenched was the flame of love in him
2123,THE ROSE,"And the light of his lantern too,"
2124,THE ROSE,As my rose wept with dewdrops three
2125,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
2126,THE ROSE,
2127,THE ROSE,And I said: I will cull my own sweet rose--
2128,THE ROSE,Some day I will claim as mine
2129,THE ROSE,The priceless worth of the flower that knows
2130,THE ROSE,"No change, but a bloom divine--"
2131,THE ROSE,The bloom of a fadeless constancy
2132,THE ROSE,That hides in the leaves in wait for me!
2133,THE ROSE,
2134,THE ROSE,"But time passed by in a strange disguise,"
2135,THE ROSE,"And I marked it not, but lay"
2136,THE ROSE,"In a lazy dream, with drowsy eyes,"
2137,THE ROSE,"Till the summer slipped away,"
2138,THE ROSE,And a chill wind sang in a minor key:
2139,THE ROSE,"""Where is the rose that waits for thee?"""
2140,THE ROSE,
2141,THE ROSE,*       *       *       *       *
2142,THE ROSE,
2143,THE ROSE,"I dream to-day, o'er a purple stain"
2144,THE ROSE,"Of bloom on a withered stalk,"
2145,THE ROSE,Pelted down by the autumn rain
2146,THE ROSE,"In the dust of the garden-walk,"
2147,THE ROSE,That an Angel-rose in the world to be
2148,THE ROSE,Will hide in the leaves in wait for me.
2149,THE ROSE,

2152,WHEN AGE COMES ON,
2153,WHEN AGE COMES ON,When Age comes on!--
2154,WHEN AGE COMES ON,The deepening dusk is where the dawn
2155,WHEN AGE COMES ON,"Once glittered splendid, and the dew"
2156,WHEN AGE COMES ON,"In honey-drips, from red rose-lips"
2157,WHEN AGE COMES ON,Was kissed away by me and you.--
2158,WHEN AGE COMES ON,And now across the frosty lawn
2159,WHEN AGE COMES ON,"Black foot-prints trail, and Age comes on--"
2160,WHEN AGE COMES ON,And Age comes on!
2161,WHEN AGE COMES ON,And biting wild-winds whistle through
2162,WHEN AGE COMES ON,Our tattered hopes--and Age comes on!
2163,WHEN AGE COMES ON,
2164,WHEN AGE COMES ON,When Age comes on!--
2165,WHEN AGE COMES ON,"O tide of raptures, long withdrawn,"
2166,WHEN AGE COMES ON,"Flow back in summer-floods, and fling"
2167,WHEN AGE COMES ON,"Here at our feet our childhood sweet,"
2168,WHEN AGE COMES ON,And all the songs we used to sing!...
2169,WHEN AGE COMES ON,"Old loves, old friends--all dead and gone--"
2170,WHEN AGE COMES ON,Our old faith lost--and Age comes on--
2171,WHEN AGE COMES ON,And Age comes on!
2172,WHEN AGE COMES ON,Poor hearts! have we not anything
2173,WHEN AGE COMES ON,But longings left when Age comes on!

2188,HAS SHE FORGOTTEN?,"The vines from these old granites, cold and gray--"
2189,HAS SHE FORGOTTEN?,And yet indeed not grim enough were they
2190,HAS SHE FORGOTTEN?,"To stay our kisses, smiles and ecstasies,"
2191,HAS SHE FORGOTTEN?,Or closer voice-lost vows and rhapsodies.
2192,HAS SHE FORGOTTEN?,Has she forgotten--that the May has won
2193,HAS SHE FORGOTTEN?,Its promise?--that the bird-songs from the tree
2194,HAS SHE FORGOTTEN?,Are sprayed above the grasses as the sun
2195,HAS SHE FORGOTTEN?,Might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly?
2196,HAS SHE FORGOTTEN?,Has she forgotten life--love--everyone--
2197,HAS SHE FORGOTTEN?,Has she forgotten me--forgotten me?

2205,II,"Just as of old, save for the tearfulness"
2206,II,"Of the clenched eyes, and the soul's vast distress?"
2207,II,Has she forgotten thus the old caress
2208,II,That made our breath a quickened atmosphere
2209,II,That failed nigh unto swooning with the sheer
2210,II,Delight? Mine arms clutch now this earthen heap
2211,II,Sodden with tears that flow on ceaselessly

2223,III,That she has risen from her reveries
2224,III,To mate her dreams with mine in marriages
2225,III,"Of mellow palms, smooth faces, and tense ease"
2226,III,"Of every longing nerve of indolence,--"
2227,III,"Lift from the grave her quiet lips, and stun"
2228,III,My senses with her kisses--drawl the glee
2229,III,"Of her glad mouth, full blithe and tenderly,"

2231,III,"The old love's awful dawn-time when said we,"

2275,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Wilful we are in our infirmity
2276,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Of childish questioning and discontent.
2277,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Whate'er befalls us is divinely meant--
2278,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Thou Truth the clearer for thy mystery!
2279,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Make us to meet what is or is to be
2280,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"With fervid welcome, knowing it is sent"
2281,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"To serve us in some way full excellent,"

2293,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,In drear disguise of sorrow; and how poor
2294,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"We seem when we are richest,--most secure"
2295,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Against all poverty the lifelong years
2296,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,We yet must waste in childish doubts and fears
2297,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"That, in despite of reason, still endure!"
2298,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Alas! the sermon of the rose we will
2299,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Not wisely ponder; nor the sobs of grief
2300,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Lulled into sighs of rapture; nor the cry
2301,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Of fierce defiance that again is still.
2302,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"Be patient--patient with our frail belief,"
2303,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,And stay it yet a little ere we die.
2304,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,
2305,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"O opulent life of ours, though dispossessed"
