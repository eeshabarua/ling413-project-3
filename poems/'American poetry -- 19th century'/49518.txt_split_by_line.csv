1935,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
1936,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"WHAT is it, my Renzo? What is thy desire?"
1937,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"To hear my story, hear the whole of it?"
1938,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And with a shamefaced air and reddened cheek
1939,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"That “others know it all, and why not thou?”"
1940,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Who has been talking to thee of me, then;"
1941,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Setting thee on to question and suspect?
1942,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Ah, boy, with eyes still full of childish dreams,"
1943,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And yet with manhood on the firm young lip,"
1944,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"’Tis a hard thing to ask me, and a strange!"
1945,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,A woman does not easily lay bare
1946,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Her history, which is her very heart,"
1947,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Even to that piece of her she calls her son!
1948,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Son he may be, but still he is a man,"
1949,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And she, though mother, is a woman still;"
1950,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And men and women are made different,"
1951,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And vainly ’gainst the barrier of sex
1952,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"They beat and beat,—all their lives long they beat,"
1953,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And never pass, never quite understand!"
1954,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Yet must I do this hard thing for thy sake,"
1955,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Since who shall do it for thee, if not I?"
1956,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Thy father, who had else more fitly told,"
1957,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Is at the wars, the weary, wasting wars;—"
1958,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Long years ago he sailed unto the wars,"
1959,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And, dead or living, comes not back to us."
1960,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Unhappy is the son who, woman-bred,"
1961,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Knows not the firm feel of a father’s hand;
1962,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And I, widow or wife, I know not which,"
1963,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Wofulest widow, still more woful wife!"
1964,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Must frame my faltering tongue to tell the tale,"
1965,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And snatch my thoughts back from their present pain
1966,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"To the old days, the hard and cruel days,"
1967,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Full of sharp hatred and stern vengeances,"
1968,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Which yet were beautiful to him and me
1969,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Who lived and loved each other and were young;
1970,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"But unto thee, born in a softer hour,"
1971,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Come as dim echoes of some warlike peal.
1972,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
1973,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Thou bearest an honorable name, my son,"
1974,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Two mighty houses meet and blend in thee;
1975,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"For I, thy mother, of the warlike line"
1976,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Of Bardi, lords of Florence in past time,"
1977,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Was daughter, and thy sire Ippolito"
1978,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Sprang from the Buondelmonti, their sworn foes;"
1979,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"For we were Guelph and they were Ghibelline,"
1980,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And centuries of wrong, and seas of blood,"
1981,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And old traditional hatreds sundered us.
1982,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Even in my babyhood I heard the name
1983,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Of Buondelmonti uttered ’twixt set teeth
1984,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And coupled with a curse, and I would pout,"
1985,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And knit my brows, and clench my tiny fist"
1986,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And whimper at the very sound of it;
1987,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Whereat my father, stout Amérigo,"
1988,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Would catch me up and toss me overhead,"
1989,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And swear I was best Bardi of them all;
1990,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And if his sons but matched his only maid
1991,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,They’d make quick work of the black Ghibellines
1992,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And of the Buondelmonti!
1993,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
1994,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,So I grew
1995,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"To woman’s stature, and men called me fair,"
1996,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And suitors, like a flight of bees, began"
1997,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,To hum and cluster wheresoe’er I moved;
1998,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And then there came the day,—that fateful day,"
1999,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"When little Gian, my father’s latest born,"
2000,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Was carried for chrism to the baptistery;
2001,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And standing, all unaware, beside the font,"
2002,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,I looked across the dim and crowded church
2003,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And saw a face—a dazzling, youthful face!"
2004,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,A face that smote my vision like a star;
2005,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"With golden locks, and eyes divinely bright"
2006,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Like San Michele in the picture there—
2007,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Fixed upon mine.
2008,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2009,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Had any whispered then
2010,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"It was Ippolito, our foeman’s son,"
2011,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"At whom I gazed, I should have turned away,"
2012,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,My father’s daughter sure had turned away.
2013,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"But nothing warned me, nothing hindered him;"
2014,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"We looked upon each other, Fate so willed,"
2015,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And with our eyes our hearts met!
2016,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2017,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"“Cursed cur,”"
2018,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"My brother muttered, fingering at his sword,"
2019,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,“I’ll teach you to ogle us when this is done!”
2020,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"“Who is it, then?” I whispered, and he told;"
2021,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And with the name I felt my heart like lead
2022,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Turn cold and cold and suddenly sink down.
2023,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2024,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And still that tender, radiant gaze wooed mine,"
2025,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And still I felt the enchantment burn and burn,"
2026,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,But would not turn my head or look again;
2027,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And all that night I lay and felt those eyes,"
2028,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And day by day they seemed to follow me,"
2029,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Like unknown planets of some strange new heaven
2030,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Whose depths I dared not question or explore;
2031,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And love and hate so strove for mastery
2032,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Within my girl’s heart, made their battle-field,"
2033,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,That all my forces failed and life grew faint.
2034,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2035,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"He, for his part, set forth with heart afire"
2036,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"To learn my name,—sad knowledge, easy gained,"
2037,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Leaving the learner stricken with a chill!
2038,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And after that, whenever I might go"
2039,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"To ball or feast, I saw him, only him!"
2040,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And while the other cavaliers pressed round
2041,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"To praise my face or dress, or hold my fan,"
2042,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Or bid me to the dance, he stood aloof"
2043,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"With passionate eyes, but never might draw near."
2044,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,For still my brother Piero or my sire
2045,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Were close behind, with dark set brows intent"
2046,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,To watch him that he did not dare to speak.
2047,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Only his eyes met mine, and in my cheeks"
2048,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,I felt the guilty color grow and grow;
2049,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And once, when all were masqued, amid the crowd"
2050,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"A hand touched mine, and oh, I knew ’twas his!"
2051,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"At last, with baffling of his heart-sick hope"
2052,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And long suspense and sorrow, he fell ill;"
2053,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And in a moment when life’s tide ran low
2054,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"He told his mother all; she, loving him well"
2055,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And loath to see him perish thus forlorn,"
2056,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Became his ally, spoke him words of cheer,"
2057,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And with my cousin Contessa, her sworn friend,"
2058,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"She counsel took; and so, betwixt the two,"
2059,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,It came about that on a day of spring
2060,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,When almond blossoms whitened the brown boughs
2061,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And olives were in bud and all birds sang,"
2062,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"We met,—a meeting cunningly contrived,"
2063,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,In an old villa garden past the walls.
2064,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"My mother had led me thither, knowing naught,"
2065,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And I, naught knowing, had wandered for a space"
2066,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Among the boskage and the fragrant vines,"
2067,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And, standing by a water-fount of stone"
2068,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Listening the tinkle and the cool, wet splash"
2069,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Of the thin drip, and thinking still of him"
2070,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"(For I went thinking of him all the day),"
2071,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"I heard the soft throb of a mandolin,"
2072,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And next a voice, divinely sweet it seemed,"
2073,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"A voice unheard till then, and yet I knew"
2074,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,The voice for his; and this the song it sang:—
2075,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2076,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"“Ah, thorns so sharp, so strong!"
2077,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Ah, path so hard, so long!"
2078,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,What do I care? Thither I fare!
2079,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,My Rose is there!
2080,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2081,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"“Ah, life so dear, so brief!"
2082,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Ah, death, the end of grief!"
2083,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"All I can bear, all will I dare!"
2084,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,My Rose is there!”
2085,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2086,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"The music ceased, the while spell-bound I stayed;"
2087,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Then came a rustle,—he was at my feet!"
2088,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2089,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Few moments might we stay, and few words speak;"
2090,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"But love is swift of tongue! all was arranged,—"
2091,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"The plan of our escape, the hour, the place,"
2092,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And that Ippolito, next night but two,"
2093,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"With a rope-ladder hidden ’neath his cloak,"
2094,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Should stand beneath my window. Once on ground
2095,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,A priest should wait to bind us quickly one.
2096,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Then a mad gallop, ere the dawn of day,"
2097,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Would set us safely forth beyond the rule
2098,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Of the Black Lily. Next, as hand in hand"
2099,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"We stood, our lips met in a first long kiss,"
2100,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And then we parted.
2101,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2102,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,With his vanishing
2103,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"The thing grew like a dream, and as in dream"
2104,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,I seemed to walk the next day and the next;
2105,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"For all my thoughts were of that coming night,"
2106,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And all my fear was lest it should not come.
2107,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And all the old-time animosities,"
2108,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And all the hates bred in me from a child,"
2109,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And feudal faiths and loyalties were dead,—"
2110,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,I was no more a Bardi; Love ruled all.
2111,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2112,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"It came, the night, and on the stroke of twelve"
2113,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"I stood at casement, wrapped in veil, with mask"
2114,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And muffling cloak laid ready close beside;
2115,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And there I stood and watched, and heard the bells"
2116,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Strike one, two, three, and saw the rose of dawn"
2117,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Deepen to day, and still my love came not."
2118,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2119,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Then, fearing to be spied, I crept to bed;"
2120,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And lying in a weary trance, half sleep,"
2121,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Heard shouts and cries and noise of joyful stir
2122,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Run through the palace, and quick echoing feet,"
2123,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And little Cosmo thundering at my door.
2124,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"“Wake, Dianora, here is glorious news!"
2125,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Ippolito, our foeman’s only son,"
2126,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Is caught red-handed on some midnight raid,"
2127,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Taken with a rope-ladder ’neath his cloak,"
2128,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Bound for some theft or felony, no doubt;"
2129,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And as he offers neither excuse nor plea,"
2130,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"He is to suffer at the hour of noon,"
2131,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,In spite of his proud father’s threats and cries.
2132,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,All that the criminal asks by way of boon
2133,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Is he may pass our palace as he goes
2134,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Unto the scaffold. A queer fancy that!
2135,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"But all the better sport it makes for us,"
2136,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And we need neither pity nor deny!
2137,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"So rise, sweet sister, don your bravest gear,"
2138,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,For all the household on the balcony
2139,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Will sit to jeer the fellow as he wends,"
2140,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And in the midst of us one Bardi Rose
2141,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Must be to grace and enjoy the spectacle,"
2142,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,The best that ever Florence saw!”
2143,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2144,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"My boy,"
2145,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Look not so startled! Those were bitter days,"
2146,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"I said, and blood had flowed and hearts grown hard,"
2147,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And hatred is contagious as disease.
2148,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Cosmo, my brother, was but as the rest."
2149,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"He died at nine, ere ever thou wast born,"
2150,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And I have paid for masses for his soul,—"
2151,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"For many, many masses have I paid;"
2152,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Heaven will not be hard with a babe like that,"
2153,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"The Frate tells me so, and I am sure."
2154,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2155,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,What was I saying? So I rose that day
2156,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"A traitor unsuspected mid his foes,"
2157,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Who were my friends, hiding ’neath feignèd smiles"
2158,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,A purpose desperate as was my hope.
2159,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"I rose, and let them deck me as they would,"
2160,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Put on my jewels, star my hair with pearls,"
2161,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And all the while a voice like funeral dirge
2162,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Sang in my half-crazed ears, or seemed to sing,"
2163,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,The fragment and the cadence of a song.
2164,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"“Ah, death, the end of grief, what do I care?”"
2165,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Then I stood up among my tiring-maids,"
2166,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And saw myself in the long Venice glass
2167,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"A vision of pale splendor, as I moved"
2168,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"To take my station on the balcony,"
2169,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"In the mid place, the very front of all,"
2170,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Set like a bride in festival array,"
2171,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Among the laughing, chattering, peering throng,"
2172,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,To see the hated foeman of our race
2173,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Led past the palace on his way to die!
2174,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"My love, my husband, my Ippolito,"
2175,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Led past our palace on his way to die!
2176,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Long time we waited, till the fear began"
2177,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"To stir that some mischance had marred the plan,"
2178,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And the procession by another street
2179,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Might pass, and so we miss the spectacle,"
2180,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"This was their fear, and my fear was the same;"
2181,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And still I sat and smiled, and while the bells"
2182,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Tolled, and they talked and buzzed, I only prayed."
2183,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"“How if he did not come? Saints, let him come!"
2184,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"O pitying Virgin, only grant he come!”"
2185,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2186,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"They came at last, the Bargello and his troop,"
2187,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And in the midst my love with hands fast tied,"
2188,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And golden locks uncurled and face all wan,"
2189,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"But still with gallant bearing, and his eyes"
2190,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Fixed upon mine,—me, for whose sake he died,"
2191,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,For whose sweet honor’s sake he silent died.
2192,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"There was a little halt, and then a cry"
2193,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Of fierce joy rang from out our balcony.
2194,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Now was my time; all sudden sprang I up,"
2195,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And while the astonished crowd kept silence deep,"
2196,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And they, my kin, amazed, sat silent too,"
2197,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"I loudly told our tale, our woful tale,"
2198,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And made avowal that ’twas for my sake
2199,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Ippolito his noble silence kept!
2200,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Then, while my brother strove to stop my mouth,"
2201,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And fierce hands clutched my gown and seized my arms,"
2202,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"I clung and pleaded: “Find the holy Friar,"
2203,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Good people, only send to find the Friar,—"
2204,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Find him, for pity’s sake! He will confirm"
2205,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"All I have said, and prove my truth and his,"
2206,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And save my dear Love, slain for love of me.”"
2207,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2208,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Then a great cry arose, some this way ran,"
2209,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Some that, and suddenly amid the press"
2210,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"A cowl was seen, and Fra Domenico,"
2211,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Breathless with haste, just conscious of our need,"
2212,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Ran in the midst, and then, I know not what,—"
2213,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"For all was tumult,—but my love stood free!"
2214,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Free and unbound! and all the populace
2215,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Shouted our twofold names, “Ippolito"
2216,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And Dianora,” and the bells broke out,"
2217,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And with the bells the sun and all the air
2218,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Seemed full of interlaced and tangled sounds,—"
2219,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Cries and glad pealings and our blended names
2220,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"On one side; on the other stormy words,"
2221,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Reproach, and curses."
2222,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2223,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Then the Podestá
2224,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And many great lords came, and all passed in,"
2225,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And up the stairs, and filled the palace full;"
2226,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And high and low joined in an equal plea
2227,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"That the long feud be stanched, and as a pledge"
2228,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Of lasting peace we two be wedded straight.
2229,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"But still my father frowned and closed his ears,"
2230,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And still my brothers fumbled at their swords;
2231,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"But when Count Buondelmonti, aged and gray,"
2232,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And shattered with the horror just escaped
2233,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Suspense and heavy sickness, hurried in,"
2234,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And kissed my hands, and knelt before my feet"
2235,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And blessèd me, the savior of his son,"
2236,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,While with redoubled zeal the Podestá
2237,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Urged, and the noble lords,—Heaven touched their hearts,—"
2238,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"They gave consent; and so the feud was healed,"
2239,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And the next day my Love and I were wed.
2240,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,
2241,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And twenty glad years came and fleetly sped.
2242,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Each like a separate rose which buds and falls
2243,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Duly and fragrantly and is not missed.
2244,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,’Twas then he carved as a memorial
2245,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,On the façade of the old Sta. Maria
2246,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Sopr’ Arno, “_Fuccio mi fecé_” and the date—"
2247,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"“I made myself a robber;” and he laughed,"
2248,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And said I was the treasure that he stole;
2249,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Ah me! and then he sailed unto the wars,"
2250,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,And all the years that have gone by since then
2251,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Are as sad night shades steeped in deadly dews.
2252,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Death hath been busy with us, as thou knowest;"
2253,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Thou art the youngest of my six fair sons,"
2254,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,Thou art the only one to close my eyes
2255,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,When time shall come and puzzles be explained.
2256,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,How did the old song run? “My Rose is there.”
2257,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,If I shall wake in Paradise one day
2258,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And find him safe, and safely still my own,"
2259,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Not won away from me by some new face,"
2260,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"And see his eyes with the old steadfast look,"
2261,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Why, that will be enough, that will be heaven!"
2262,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"But if, instead, I find another there"
2263,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"Close to his side where once I used to rest,"
2264,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"No matter who it be, angel or saint,"
2265,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,I must cry “Shame!” whate’er the penalty.
2266,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,"God will not need to send me down to fires,"
2267,A FLORENTINE JULIET.,But only bid me stay in heaven and look!
