58,_ONE._,
59,_ONE._,
60,_ONE._,Through miles of green cornfields that lusty
61,_ONE._,And strong face the sun and rejoice
62,_ONE._,"In his heat, where the brown bees go dusty"
63,_ONE._,"With pollen from flowers of their choice,"
64,_ONE._,’Mong myriads down by the river
65,_ONE._,"Who offer their honey, the train"
66,_ONE._,"Flies south with a whir and a shiver,"
67,_ONE._,Flies south through the lowlands that quiver
68,_ONE._,With ripening grain--
69,_ONE._,
70,_ONE._,"Fair wheat, like a lady for fancies,"
71,_ONE._,"Who bends to the breeze, while the corn"
72,_ONE._,Held stiff all his stubborn green lances
73,_ONE._,The moment his curled leaf was born;
74,_ONE._,"And grapes, where the vineyards are sweeping"
75,_ONE._,The shores of the river whose tide--
76,_ONE._,"Slow moving, brown tide--holds the keeping"
77,_ONE._,"Of War and of Peace that lie sleeping,"
78,_ONE._,"Couched lions, each side."
79,_ONE._,
80,_ONE._,"Hair curlless, and hid, and smooth-banded,"
81,_ONE._,"Blue innocent maidenly eyes,"
82,_ONE._,That gaze at the lawless rough-handed
83,_ONE._,Young soldiers with grieving surprise
84,_ONE._,"At oaths on their lips, the deriding"
85,_ONE._,"And jestings that load every breath,"
86,_ONE._,While on with dread swiftness are gliding
87,_ONE._,"Their moments, and o’er them is biding"
88,_ONE._,The shadow of death!
89,_ONE._,
90,_ONE._,"Face clear-cut and pearly, a slender"
91,_ONE._,"Small maiden with calm, home-bred air;"
92,_ONE._,No deep-tinted hues you might lend her
93,_ONE._,"Could touch the faint gold of her hair,"
94,_ONE._,"The blue of her eyes, or the neatness"
95,_ONE._,"Of quaint little gown, smoothly spun"
96,_ONE._,"From threads of soft gray, whose completeness"
97,_ONE._,Doth fit her withdrawn gentle sweetness--
98,_ONE._,A lily turned nun.
99,_ONE._,
100,_ONE._,"Ohio shines on to her border,"
101,_ONE._,Ohio all golden with grain;
102,_ONE._,"The river comes up at her order,"
103,_ONE._,And curves toward the incoming train;
104,_ONE._,“The river! The river! O borrow
105,_ONE._,A speed that is swifter-- Afar
106,_ONE._,"Kentucky! Haste, haste, thou To-morrow!”"
107,_ONE._,"Poor lads, dreaming not of the sorrow,"
108,_ONE._,The anguish of war.

113,_THE OTHER._,_THE OTHER._
114,_THE OTHER._,
115,_THE OTHER._,
116,_THE OTHER._,West from the Capital’s crowded throng
117,_THE OTHER._,"The fiery engine rushed along,"
118,_THE OTHER._,Over the road where danger lay
119,_THE OTHER._,"On each bridge and curve of the midnight way,"
120,_THE OTHER._,"Shooting across the rivers’ laps,"
121,_THE OTHER._,"Up the mountains, into the gaps,"
122,_THE OTHER._,"Through West Virginia like the wind,"
123,_THE OTHER._,"Fire and sword coming on behind,"
124,_THE OTHER._,Whistling defiance that echoed back
125,_THE OTHER._,"To mountain guerrillas burning the track,"
126,_THE OTHER._,"“Do the worst, ye rebels, that ye can do"
127,_THE OTHER._,"To the train that follows, but _I_ go through!”"
128,_THE OTHER._,
129,_THE OTHER._,A motley crowd--the city thief;
130,_THE OTHER._,The man of God; the polished chief
131,_THE OTHER._,Of a band of gamblers; the traitor spy;
132,_THE OTHER._,"The correspondent with quick, sharp eye;"
133,_THE OTHER._,The speculator who boldly made
134,_THE OTHER._,His fifty per cent. in a driving trade
135,_THE OTHER._,At the edge of the war; the clean lank clerk
136,_THE OTHER._,Sent West for sanitary work;
137,_THE OTHER._,The bounty-jumper; the lordling born
138,_THE OTHER._,Viewing the country with wondering scorn--
139,_THE OTHER._,A strange assemblage filled the car
140,_THE OTHER._,"That dared the midnight border-band,"
141,_THE OTHER._,Where life and death went hand-in-hand
142,_THE OTHER._,Those strange and breathless days of war.
143,_THE OTHER._,
144,_THE OTHER._,"The conductor’s lantern moves along,"
145,_THE OTHER._,Slowly lighting the motley throng
146,_THE OTHER._,Face by face; what sudden gleam
147,_THE OTHER._,Flashes back in the lantern’s beam
148,_THE OTHER._,Through shadows down at the rearward door?
149,_THE OTHER._,The conductor pauses; all eyes explore
150,_THE OTHER._,The darkened corner: a woman’s face
151,_THE OTHER._,"Thrown back asleep--the shimmer of lace,"
152,_THE OTHER._,"The sheen of silk, the yellow of gold,"
153,_THE OTHER._,"The flash of jewels, the careless fold"
154,_THE OTHER._,Of an India shawl that half concealed
155,_THE OTHER._,The curves superb which the light revealed;
156,_THE OTHER._,"A sweep of shoulder, a rounded arm,"
157,_THE OTHER._,A perfect hand that lay soft and warm
158,_THE OTHER._,On the dingy seat; all the outlines rare
159,_THE OTHER._,Of a Milo Venus slumbered there
160,_THE OTHER._,’Neath the costly silk whose heaviest fold
161,_THE OTHER._,Subordinate seemed--unnoticed mould
162,_THE OTHER._,For the form beneath.
163,_THE OTHER._,
164,_THE OTHER._,The sumptuous grace
165,_THE OTHER._,"Of the careless pose, the sleeping face,"
166,_THE OTHER._,"Transfixed all eyes, and together drew"
167,_THE OTHER._,One and all for a nearer view:
168,_THE OTHER._,"The lank clerk hasted, the gambler trod"
169,_THE OTHER._,On the heels of the gazing man of God;
170,_THE OTHER._,"The correspondent took out his book,"
171,_THE OTHER._,Sharpened his pencil with eager look;
172,_THE OTHER._,The soldiers fought as to who should pass
173,_THE OTHER._,"The first; the lord peered through his glass,"
174,_THE OTHER._,But no sooner saw the sleeping face
175,_THE OTHER._,Than he too hasted and left his place
176,_THE OTHER._,To join the crowd.
177,_THE OTHER._,"Then, ere any spoke,"
178,_THE OTHER._,"But all eager gazed, the lady woke."
179,_THE OTHER._,
180,_THE OTHER._,"Dark-brown, sleepy, velvet eyes,"
181,_THE OTHER._,"Lifted up in soft surprise,"
182,_THE OTHER._,"A wealth of hair of auburn red,"
183,_THE OTHER._,Falling in braids from the regal head
184,_THE OTHER._,Whose little hat with waving plume
185,_THE OTHER._,"Lay on the floor--while a faint perfume,"
186,_THE OTHER._,"The roses, crushed in sleep, betrayed,"
187,_THE OTHER._,Tangled within the loosened braid;
188,_THE OTHER._,"Bold features, Nubian lips, a skin"
189,_THE OTHER._,"Creamy pallid, the red within"
190,_THE OTHER._,Mixed with brown where the shadow lies
191,_THE OTHER._,Dark beneath the lustrous eyes.
192,_THE OTHER._,She smiles; all hearts are at her feet.
193,_THE OTHER._,She turns; each hastens to his seat.
194,_THE OTHER._,The car is changed to a sacred place
195,_THE OTHER._,Lighted by one fair woman’s face;
196,_THE OTHER._,"In sudden silence on they ride,"
197,_THE OTHER._,"The lord and the gambler, side by side,"
198,_THE OTHER._,"The traitor spy, the priest as well,"
199,_THE OTHER._,"Bound for the time by a common spell,"
200,_THE OTHER._,And each might be in thought and mien
201,_THE OTHER._,"A loyal knight escorting his queen,"
202,_THE OTHER._,So instant and so measureless
203,_THE OTHER._,Is the power of a perfect loveliness.

208,_THE MEETING._,_THE MEETING._
209,_THE MEETING._,
210,_THE MEETING._,
211,_THE MEETING._,"The Western city with the Roman name,"
212,_THE MEETING._,"The vine-decked river winding round the hills,"
213,_THE MEETING._,Are left behind; the pearly maid who came
214,_THE MEETING._,Down from the northern lake whose cool breath fills
215,_THE MEETING._,"The whole horizon, like the green, salt sea,"
216,_THE MEETING._,"Is riding southward on the cautious train,"
217,_THE MEETING._,"That feels its way along, and nervously"
218,_THE MEETING._,"Hurries around the curve and o’er the bridge,"
219,_THE MEETING._,Fearing a rebel ball from every ridge--
220,_THE MEETING._,The wild adventurous cavalry campaign
221,_THE MEETING._,"That Morgan and his men, bold riders all,"
222,_THE MEETING._,"Kept up in fair Kentucky all those years,"
223,_THE MEETING._,"So hot with daring deeds, with glowing tears,"
224,_THE MEETING._,"That even Peace doth sometime seem a pall,"
225,_THE MEETING._,When men in city offices feel yet
226,_THE MEETING._,The old wild thrill of “Boots and saddles all!”
227,_THE MEETING._,The dashing raid they cannot quite forget
228,_THE MEETING._,Despite the hasty graves that silent lie
229,_THE MEETING._,"Along its route; at home the women sigh,"
230,_THE MEETING._,"Gazing across the still untrodden ways,"
231,_THE MEETING._,"Across the fields, across the lonely moor,"
232,_THE MEETING._,“O for the breathless ardor of those days
233,_THE MEETING._,"When we were all so happy, though so poor!”"
234,_THE MEETING._,
235,_THE MEETING._,The maiden sits alone;
236,_THE MEETING._,"The raw recruits are scattered through the car,"
237,_THE MEETING._,"Talking of all the splendors of the war,"
238,_THE MEETING._,With faces grimed and roistering braggart tone.
239,_THE MEETING._,"In the gray dawning, sweet and fair to view,"
240,_THE MEETING._,"Like opening wood-flower pearled with morning dew,"
241,_THE MEETING._,"She shines among them in her radiance pure,"
242,_THE MEETING._,"Notes all their lawless roughness, sadly sure"
243,_THE MEETING._,They’re very wicked--hoping that the day
244,_THE MEETING._,"Of long-drawn hours may safely wear away,"
245,_THE MEETING._,"And bring her, ere the summer sunset dies,"
246,_THE MEETING._,"To the far farm-house where her lover lies,"
247,_THE MEETING._,Wounded--alone.
248,_THE MEETING._,"The rattling speed turns slow,"
249,_THE MEETING._,"Slow, slower all the rusty car-wheels go,"
250,_THE MEETING._,"The axles groan, the brakes grind harshly down;"
251,_THE MEETING._,The young conductor comes--(there was a face
252,_THE MEETING._,"He noted in the night)--“Madam, your place"
253,_THE MEETING._,"Will soon be noisy, for at yonder town"
254,_THE MEETING._,We take on other soldiers. If you change
255,_THE MEETING._,"Your seat and join that little lady, then"
256,_THE MEETING._,It will not seem so lonely or so strange
257,_THE MEETING._,"For you, as here among so many men.”"
258,_THE MEETING._,"Lifting her fair face from the battered seat,"
259,_THE MEETING._,"Where she had slumbered like a weary child,"
260,_THE MEETING._,"The lady, with obedience full sweet"
261,_THE MEETING._,"To his young manhood’s eager craving, smiled"
262,_THE MEETING._,"And rose. Happy, the flushed youth led the way;"
263,_THE MEETING._,She followed in her lovely disarray.
264,_THE MEETING._,"The clinging silk disclosed the archèd foot,"
265,_THE MEETING._,"Hidden within the dainty satin boot,"
266,_THE MEETING._,Dead-black against the dead-white even hue
267,_THE MEETING._,"Of silken stocking, gleaming into view"
268,_THE MEETING._,One moment; then the lady sleepily
269,_THE MEETING._,"Adjusted with a touch her drapery,"
270,_THE MEETING._,"And tried to loop in place a falling braid,"
271,_THE MEETING._,And smooth the rippling waves the night had made;
272,_THE MEETING._,While the first sunbeams flashing through the pane
273,_THE MEETING._,Set her bright gems to flashing back again;
274,_THE MEETING._,And all men’s eyes in that Kentucky car
275,_THE MEETING._,"Grew on her face, as all men’s eyes had done"
276,_THE MEETING._,"On the night-train that brought her from afar,"
277,_THE MEETING._,Over the mountains west from Washington.
278,_THE MEETING._,
279,_THE MEETING._,THE LADY (_thinking_).
280,_THE MEETING._,
281,_THE MEETING._,"Haply met,"
282,_THE MEETING._,"This country maiden, sweet as mignonette,"
283,_THE MEETING._,No doubt the pride of some small Western town:--
284,_THE MEETING._,"Pity, that she should wear that hopeless gown,"
285,_THE MEETING._,So prim--so dull--a fashion five years old!
286,_THE MEETING._,
287,_THE MEETING._,THE MAIDEN (_thinking_).
288,_THE MEETING._,
289,_THE MEETING._,"How odd, how bold,"
290,_THE MEETING._,"That silken robe--those waves of costly lace,"
291,_THE MEETING._,"That falling hair, the shadows ’neath the eyes,"
292,_THE MEETING._,Surely those diamonds are out of place--
293,_THE MEETING._,"Strange, that a lady should in such a guise"
294,_THE MEETING._,Be here alone!
295,_THE MEETING._,
296,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
297,THE LADY.,
298,THE LADY.,"Allow me, mademoiselle,"
299,THE LADY.,Our good conductor thinks it would be well
300,THE LADY.,"That we should keep together, since the car"
301,THE LADY.,"Will soon be overcrowded, and we are"
302,THE LADY.,The only women.--May I have a seat
303,THE LADY.,In this safe little corner by your side?
304,THE LADY.,"Thanks; it is fortunate, indeed, to meet"
305,THE LADY.,So sweet a friend to share the long day’s ride!--
306,THE LADY.,"That is, if yours be long?"
307,THE LADY.,
308,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
309,THE MAIDEN.,
310,THE MAIDEN.,To Benton’s Mill.
311,THE MAIDEN.,
312,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
313,THE LADY.,
314,THE LADY.,"I go beyond, not far--I think we pass"
315,THE LADY.,Your station just before Waunona Hill;
316,THE LADY.,But both are in the heart of the Blue Grass.
317,THE LADY.,Do you not love that land?
318,THE LADY.,
319,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
320,THE MAIDEN.,
321,THE MAIDEN.,I do not know
322,THE MAIDEN.,Aught of it.
323,THE MAIDEN.,
324,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
325,THE LADY.,
326,THE LADY.,Yes; but surely you have heard
327,THE LADY.,"Of the fair plains where the sweet grasses grow,"
328,THE LADY.,"Just grass, naught else; and where the noble herd"
329,THE LADY.,"Of blooded cattle graze, and horses bred"
330,THE LADY.,For victory--the rare Kentucky speed
331,THE LADY.,That wins the races?
332,THE LADY.,
333,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
334,THE MAIDEN.,
335,THE MAIDEN.,Yes; I’ve heard it said
336,THE MAIDEN.,They were good worthy horses.--But indeed
337,THE MAIDEN.,I know not much of horses.
338,THE MAIDEN.,
339,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
340,THE LADY.,
341,THE LADY.,Then the land--
342,THE LADY.,"The lovely, rolling land of the Blue Grass,"
343,THE LADY.,The wild free park spread out by Nature’s hand
344,THE LADY.,That scarce an English dukedom may surpass
345,THE LADY.,In velvet beauty--while its royal sweep
346,THE LADY.,"Over the country miles and miles away,"
347,THE LADY.,Dwarfs man-made parks to toys; the great trees keep
348,THE LADY.,"Their distance from each other, proud array"
349,THE LADY.,Of single elms that stand apart to show
350,THE LADY.,"How gracefully their swaying branches grow,"
351,THE LADY.,While little swells of turf roll up and fall
352,THE LADY.,"Like waves of summer sea, and over all"
353,THE LADY.,"You catch, when the straight shafts of sunset pass"
354,THE LADY.,"Over the lea, the glint of the Blue Grass.--"
355,THE LADY.,But you will see it.
356,THE LADY.,
357,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
358,THE MAIDEN.,
359,THE MAIDEN.,No; I cannot stay
360,THE MAIDEN.,"But a few hours--at most, a single day."
361,THE MAIDEN.,
362,THE MAIDEN.,THE LADY (_unheeding_).
363,THE MAIDEN.,
364,THE MAIDEN.,"I think I like the best,"
365,THE MAIDEN.,"Of all dumb things, a horse of Blue-Grass breed,"
366,THE MAIDEN.,"The Arab courser of our own new West,"
367,THE MAIDEN.,"The splendid creature, whose free-hearted speed"
368,THE MAIDEN.,Outstrips e’en time itself. Oh! when he wins
369,THE MAIDEN.,"The race, how, pulsed with pride, I wave my hand"
370,THE MAIDEN.,"In triumph, ere the thundering shout begins,"
371,THE MAIDEN.,"And those slow, cautious judges on the stand,"
372,THE MAIDEN.,Have counted seconds! Is it not a thrill
373,THE MAIDEN.,"That stirs the blood, yet holds the quick breath still?"
374,THE MAIDEN.,
375,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
376,THE MAIDEN.,
377,THE MAIDEN.,"I ne’er have seen race-horses, or a race."
378,THE MAIDEN.,
379,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
380,THE LADY.,
381,THE LADY.,I crave your pardon; in your gentle face
382,THE LADY.,I read reproof.
383,THE LADY.,
384,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
385,THE MAIDEN.,
386,THE MAIDEN.,I judge not any man.
387,THE MAIDEN.,
388,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
389,THE LADY.,
390,THE LADY.,Nor woman?
391,THE LADY.,
392,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
393,THE MAIDEN.,
394,THE MAIDEN.,"If you force reply, I can"
395,THE MAIDEN.,"Speak but the truth. The cruel, panting race,"
396,THE MAIDEN.,"For gamblers’ prizes, seems not worthy place"
397,THE MAIDEN.,"For women--nor for men, indeed, if they"
398,THE MAIDEN.,"Were purer grown. Of kindred ill the play,"
399,THE MAIDEN.,"The dinner loud with wine, the midnight dance,"
400,THE MAIDEN.,The deadly poison of all games of chance--
401,THE MAIDEN.,All these are sinful.
402,THE MAIDEN.,
403,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
404,THE LADY.,
405,THE LADY.,"Ah! poor sins, how stern"
406,THE LADY.,The judge! I knew ye not for sins--I learn
407,THE LADY.,"For the first time that ye are evil. Go,"
408,THE LADY.,Avaunt ye! So my races are a woe--
409,THE LADY.,Alas! And David Garrick!--Where’s the harm
410,THE LADY.,In David?
411,THE LADY.,
412,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
413,THE MAIDEN.,
414,THE MAIDEN.,I know not the gentleman.
415,THE MAIDEN.,
416,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
417,THE LADY.,
418,THE LADY.,"Nay, he’s a play; a comedy so warm,"
419,THE LADY.,"So pitiful, that, let those laugh who can,"
420,THE LADY.,"_I_ weep. And must I yield my crystal glass,"
421,THE LADY.,"Dewy with ice, and fragrant with rare wine,"
422,THE LADY.,That makes a dreary dinner-party pass
423,THE LADY.,"In rosy light, where after-fancies shine--"
424,THE LADY.,"Things that one might have said?--And then the dance,"
425,THE LADY.,"The _valse à deux temps_, if your partner chance"
426,THE LADY.,To be a lover--
427,THE LADY.,
428,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
429,THE MAIDEN.,
430,THE MAIDEN.,"Madam, pray excuse"
431,THE MAIDEN.,My seeming rudeness; but I must refuse
432,THE MAIDEN.,To dwell on themes like these.
433,THE MAIDEN.,
434,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
435,THE LADY.,
436,THE LADY.,Did I begin
437,THE LADY.,"The themes, or you?"
438,THE LADY.,
439,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
440,THE MAIDEN.,
441,THE MAIDEN.,"But _I_ dwelt on the sin,"
442,THE MAIDEN.,And you--
443,THE MAIDEN.,
444,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
445,THE LADY.,
446,THE LADY.,Upon the good. Did I not well?
447,THE LADY.,"I gave you good for evil, mademoiselle."
448,THE LADY.,
449,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
450,THE MAIDEN.,
451,THE MAIDEN.,"Forgive me, lady, but I cannot jest,"
452,THE MAIDEN.,I bear too anxious heart within my breast;
453,THE MAIDEN.,"One dear to me lies wounded, and I go"
454,THE MAIDEN.,"To find him, help him home with tender care--"
455,THE MAIDEN.,"To home and health, God willing."
456,THE MAIDEN.,
457,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
458,THE LADY.,
459,THE LADY.,Is it so?
460,THE LADY.,"Strange--but ah! no. The wounded are not rare,"
461,THE LADY.,"Nor yet the grief, in this heart-rending war.--"
462,THE LADY.,But he will yet recover; I feel sure
463,THE LADY.,"That one beloved by heart so good, so pure"
464,THE LADY.,"As yours, will not be taken. Sweet, your star"
465,THE LADY.,Is fortunate.
466,THE LADY.,
467,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
468,THE MAIDEN.,
469,THE MAIDEN.,"Not in the stars, I trust."
470,THE MAIDEN.,"We are but wretched creatures of the dust,"
471,THE MAIDEN.,"Sinful, and desperately wicked; still,"
472,THE MAIDEN.,It is in mercy our Creator’s will
473,THE MAIDEN.,To hear our prayers.
474,THE MAIDEN.,
475,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
476,THE LADY.,
477,THE LADY.,And do you then believe
478,THE LADY.,He grants all heart-felt prayers? One might conceive
479,THE LADY.,A case: Suppose a loving mother prays
480,THE LADY.,"For her son’s life; he, worn with life’s hard ways,"
481,THE LADY.,Entreats his God for death with equal power
482,THE LADY.,And fervor.
483,THE LADY.,
484,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
485,THE MAIDEN.,
486,THE MAIDEN.,It is wrong to pray for death.
487,THE MAIDEN.,
488,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
489,THE LADY.,
490,THE LADY.,"I grant it not. But, say in self-same hour"
491,THE LADY.,A farmer prays for rain; with ’bated breath
492,THE LADY.,"A mother, hastening to a dying child,"
493,THE LADY.,Prays for fair weather?--But you do not deign
494,THE LADY.,To listen. Ah! I saw you when you smiled
495,THE LADY.,"That little, silver smile! I might explain"
496,THE LADY.,My meaning further; but why should I shake
497,THE LADY.,Your happy faith?
498,THE LADY.,
499,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
500,THE MAIDEN.,
501,THE MAIDEN.,You could not.
502,THE MAIDEN.,
503,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
504,THE LADY.,
505,THE LADY.,"Nay, that’s true;"
506,THE LADY.,You are the kind that walks up to the stake
507,THE LADY.,Unflinching and unquestioning. I sue
508,THE LADY.,"For pardon, and I pray you tell me all"
509,THE LADY.,This tale of yours. When did your lover fall--
510,THE LADY.,What battle-field?
511,THE LADY.,
512,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
513,THE MAIDEN.,
514,THE MAIDEN.,Not any well-known name;
515,THE MAIDEN.,It was not Heaven’s pleasure that the fame
516,THE MAIDEN.,Of well-known battle should be his. A band
517,THE MAIDEN.,"Of wild guerrillas raiding through the land,"
518,THE MAIDEN.,"Shot him, and left him bleeding by the way."
519,THE MAIDEN.,
520,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
521,THE LADY.,
522,THE LADY.,Guerrillas?
523,THE LADY.,
524,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
525,THE MAIDEN.,
526,THE MAIDEN.,Yes; John Morgan’s.
527,THE MAIDEN.,
528,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
529,THE LADY.,
530,THE LADY.,"Maybe so,"
531,THE LADY.,And maybe not; they bear a seven-leagued name
532,THE LADY.,"That many hide beneath; each shot, each blow,"
533,THE LADY.,"Is trumpeted as theirs, and all the blame"
534,THE LADY.,"Falls on their shoulders, be it what it may--"
535,THE LADY.,"Now truth, and now but falsehood. Morgan’s men"
536,THE LADY.,Are bold Kentucky riders; every glen
537,THE LADY.,Knows their fleet midnight gallop; every map
538,THE LADY.,Kept by our soldiers here is scored with marks
539,THE LADY.,"Where they have been; now near, now miles away,"
540,THE LADY.,"From river lowland to the mountain-gap,"
541,THE LADY.,Swift as the rushing wind. No watch-dog barks
542,THE LADY.,"When _they_ ride by, no well-versed tongues betray"
543,THE LADY.,"Their resting-place; Kentucky knows her own,"
544,THE LADY.,"Gives silent, helpful welcome when they pass"
545,THE LADY.,"Across her borders north from Tennessee,"
546,THE LADY.,"Heading their horses for the far Blue Grass,"
547,THE LADY.,"The land of home, the land they long to see,"
548,THE LADY.,The lovely rolling land. We might have known
549,THE LADY.,That come they would!
550,THE LADY.,
551,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
552,THE MAIDEN.,
553,THE MAIDEN.,You are Kentucky-bred?
554,THE MAIDEN.,
555,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
556,THE LADY.,
557,THE LADY.,I come from Washington. Nay--but I read
558,THE LADY.,The doubt you try to hide. Be frank--confess--
559,THE LADY.,I am that mythical adventuress
560,THE LADY.,That thrives in Washington these troublous days--
561,THE LADY.,The country correspondent’s tale?
562,THE LADY.,
563,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
564,THE MAIDEN.,
565,THE MAIDEN.,Your dress--
566,THE MAIDEN.,And--something in your air--
567,THE MAIDEN.,
568,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
569,THE LADY.,
570,THE LADY.,I give you praise
571,THE LADY.,For rare sincerity. Go on.
572,THE LADY.,
573,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
574,THE MAIDEN.,
575,THE MAIDEN.,"Your tone,"
576,THE MAIDEN.,"Your words, seem strange.--But then, I’ve never known"
577,THE MAIDEN.,A woman like you.
578,THE MAIDEN.,
579,THE MAIDEN.,THE LADY (_aside_).
580,THE MAIDEN.,
581,THE MAIDEN.,"Yet we are not few,"
582,THE MAIDEN.,"Thank Heaven, for the world’s sake! It would starve"
583,THE MAIDEN.,"If gray was all its color, and the dew"
584,THE MAIDEN.,Its only nectar. With a pulsing haste
585,THE MAIDEN.,"It seeks the royal purples, and draws down"
586,THE MAIDEN.,"The luscious bunches to its thirsty taste,"
587,THE MAIDEN.,"And feels its blood hot-thrilled, a regal crown"
588,THE MAIDEN.,"Upon its brow; and then, its hands do carve"
589,THE MAIDEN.,The vine-leaves into marble.
590,THE MAIDEN.,But the hue
591,THE MAIDEN.,Of thoughts like these she knows not--and in vain
592,THE MAIDEN.,"To tell her. Yet, sweet snow-drop, I would fain"
593,THE MAIDEN.,Hear her small story.
594,THE MAIDEN.,"(_Speaks._) Did he fall alone,"
595,THE MAIDEN.,Your gallant soldier-boy? And how to you
596,THE MAIDEN.,Came the sad news?
597,THE MAIDEN.,
598,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
599,THE MAIDEN.,
600,THE MAIDEN.,A farmer heard him moan
601,THE MAIDEN.,"While passing--bore him to the camp, and there"
602,THE MAIDEN.,A captain from our lake-shore wrote me word
603,THE MAIDEN.,"Ere the brigade moved on; which, when I heard,"
604,THE MAIDEN.,"I left my mother, ill, for in despair"
605,THE MAIDEN.,"He cried, they wrote, for me. He could not know"
606,THE MAIDEN.,"That they had written, for hot fever drove"
607,THE MAIDEN.,"His thoughts with whips of flame.--O cruel woe,--O my poor love--"
608,THE MAIDEN.,My Willie!
609,THE MAIDEN.,
610,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
611,THE LADY.,
612,THE LADY.,"Do not grieve, fair child. This day"
613,THE LADY.,"Will see you by his side--nay, if you will,"
614,THE LADY.,Then lay your head here--weep your grief away.
615,THE LADY.,"Tears are a luxury--yes, take your fill;"
616,THE LADY.,"For stranger as I am, my heart is warm"
617,THE LADY.,"To woman’s sorrow, and this woman’s arm"
618,THE LADY.,That holds you is a loyal one and kind.
619,THE LADY.,"(_Thinking._) O gentle maiden-mind,"
620,THE LADY.,How lovely art thou--like the limpid brook
621,THE LADY.,In whose small depths my child-eyes loved to look
622,THE LADY.,In the spring days! Thy little simple fears
623,THE LADY.,Are wept away. Ah! could _I_ call the tears
624,THE LADY.,At will to soothe the parched heat of my heart!
625,THE LADY.,"--O beautiful lost Faith,"
626,THE LADY.,"I knew you once--but now, like shadowy wraith,"
627,THE LADY.,"You meet me in this little maiden’s eyes,"
628,THE LADY.,And gaze from out their blue in sad surprise
629,THE LADY.,"At the great gulf between us. Far apart,"
630,THE LADY.,"In truth, we’ve drifted--drifted. Gentle ghost"
631,THE LADY.,"Of past outgrown, thy land the hazy coast"
632,THE LADY.,Of dreamless ignorance; I must put out
633,THE LADY.,"My eyes to live with you again. The doubt,"
634,THE LADY.,"The honest, earnest doubt, is upward growth"
635,THE LADY.,Of the strong mind--the struggle of the seed
636,THE LADY.,"Up to the broad, free air. Contented sloth"
637,THE LADY.,Of the blind clods around it sees no need
638,THE LADY.,"For change--nay, deems, indeed, all change a crime;"
639,THE LADY.,“All things remain as in our fathers’ time--
640,THE LADY.,What gain ye then by growing?”
641,THE LADY.,“Air--free air!
642,THE LADY.,"E’en though I die of hunger and despair,"
643,THE LADY.,"I go,” the mind replies."
644,THE LADY.,
645,THE LADY.,THE MAIDEN (_thinking_).
646,THE LADY.,
647,THE LADY.,"How kind, how warm"
648,THE LADY.,Her sympathy! I could no more resist
649,THE LADY.,"Her questions, than the large clasp of her arm"
650,THE LADY.,That drew me down. How tenderly she kissed
651,THE LADY.,My forehead! strange that so much good should dwell
652,THE LADY.,"With so much ill. This shining, costly dress,"
653,THE LADY.,"A garb that shows a sinful worldliness,"
654,THE LADY.,Troubles my heart.
655,THE LADY.,"Ah, I remember well"
656,THE LADY.,How hard I worked after that letter came
657,THE LADY.,"Telling of Willie--and my sisters all,"
658,THE LADY.,How swift we sewed! For I had suffered shame
659,THE LADY.,At traveling in house-garb.
660,THE LADY.,--I feel a call
661,THE LADY.,"To bring this wanderer back into the fold,"
662,THE LADY.,This poor lost sinner straying in the cold
663,THE LADY.,Outside the church’s pale. Should I not try
664,THE LADY.,"To show her all the sad deficiency,"
665,THE LADY.,"The desperate poverty of life like hers,"
666,THE LADY.,"The utter falseness of its every breath,"
667,THE LADY.,The pity that within my bosom stirs
668,THE LADY.,For thinking of the horrors after death
669,THE LADY.,Awaiting her?
670,THE LADY.,
671,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
672,THE LADY.,
673,THE LADY.,"Quite calm, again? That’s well."
674,THE LADY.,Wilt taste a peach? My basket holds a store
675,THE LADY.,"Of luscious peaches. Ah! she weaves a spell,"
676,THE LADY.,This lovely sorceress of fruit; what more
677,THE LADY.,Can man ask from the earth? There is no cost
678,THE LADY.,Too great for peaches. I have felt surprise
679,THE LADY.,Through all my life that fair Eve should have lost
680,THE LADY.,That mythic Asian land of Paradise
681,THE LADY.,"For a poor plebeian apple! Now a peach,"
682,THE LADY.,"Pulpy, pink-veined, hanging within her reach,"
683,THE LADY.,Might well have tempted her.
684,THE LADY.,
685,THE LADY.,"Oh, these long hours!--"
686,THE LADY.,Whence comes this faint perfume of hot-house flowers--
687,THE LADY.,Tea-roses?
688,THE LADY.,
689,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
690,THE MAIDEN.,
691,THE MAIDEN.,Tangled in your loosened hair
692,THE MAIDEN.,Are roses.
693,THE MAIDEN.,
694,THE MAIDEN.,THE LADY (_thinking_).
695,THE MAIDEN.,
696,THE MAIDEN.,Nita must have twined them there--
697,THE MAIDEN.,The opera--I know now; I have sped
698,THE MAIDEN.,"So swift across the country, my poor head"
699,THE MAIDEN.,"Is turned.--The opera? Yes; then--O heart,"
700,THE MAIDEN.,How hast thou bled! [_Dashes away tears._]
701,THE MAIDEN.,"(_Speaks._) Sweet child, I pray you tell"
702,THE MAIDEN.,"Again your budding romance, all the part"
703,THE MAIDEN.,"Where he first spoke. You’d known him long and well,"
704,THE MAIDEN.,Your Willie?
705,THE MAIDEN.,
706,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
707,THE MAIDEN.,
708,THE MAIDEN.,Yes; in childhood we had been
709,THE MAIDEN.,Two little lovers o’er the alphabet;
710,THE MAIDEN.,Then one day--I had grown to just sixteen--
711,THE MAIDEN.,"Down in the apple-orchard--there--we met,"
712,THE MAIDEN.,By chance--and--
713,THE MAIDEN.,
714,THE MAIDEN.,THE LADY (_thinking_).
715,THE MAIDEN.,
716,THE MAIDEN.,"Blush, thou fine-grained little cheek,"
717,THE MAIDEN.,It comforts me to see that e’en thy meek
718,THE MAIDEN.,Child-beauty knows enough of love to blush.
719,THE MAIDEN.,"(_Speaks._) Nay, you flush"
720,THE MAIDEN.,"So prettily! Well, must _I_ tell the rest?"
721,THE MAIDEN.,"You knew, then, all at once, you loved him best,"
722,THE MAIDEN.,This gallant Willie?
723,THE MAIDEN.,
724,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN (_thinking_).
725,THE MAIDEN.,
726,THE MAIDEN.,What has come to me
727,THE MAIDEN.,"That I do answer, from reserve so free,"
728,THE MAIDEN.,This stranger’s questions? Yet may it not chance
729,THE MAIDEN.,My confidence shall win hers in return?
730,THE MAIDEN.,"I must press on, nor give one backward glance--"
731,THE MAIDEN.,Must follow up my gain by words that burn
732,THE MAIDEN.,With charity and Christian zeal.
733,THE MAIDEN.,(_Speaks._) Yes; then
734,THE MAIDEN.,"We were betrothed. I wore his mother’s ring,--"
735,THE MAIDEN.,And Willie joined the church; before all men
736,THE MAIDEN.,He made the promises and vows which bring
737,THE MAIDEN.,"A blessing down from God. Dear lady, strength"
738,THE MAIDEN.,From Heaven came to us. Could I endure
739,THE MAIDEN.,"This absence, silence, all the weary length"
740,THE MAIDEN.,"Of hours and days and months, were I not sure"
741,THE MAIDEN.,That God was with my Willie? If on you
742,THE MAIDEN.,"Sorrow has fallen, lady (and those tears"
743,THE MAIDEN.,"Showed me its presence), seek the good, the true,"
744,THE MAIDEN.,In this sad life; a prayer can calm all fears;
745,THE MAIDEN.,"Yield all your troubles to your God’s control,"
746,THE MAIDEN.,And He will bless you. Ah! where should _I_ be
747,THE MAIDEN.,Did I not know that in my Willie’s soul
748,THE MAIDEN.,"Came first the love of God, then love for me?"
749,THE MAIDEN.,
750,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
751,THE LADY.,
752,THE LADY.,His love for you comes _second_?
753,THE LADY.,
754,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
755,THE MAIDEN.,
756,THE MAIDEN.,Would you have
757,THE MAIDEN.,A mortal love come first?
758,THE MAIDEN.,
759,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
760,THE LADY.,
761,THE LADY.,"Sweet heart, I crave"
762,THE LADY.,Your pardon. For your gentle Christian zeal
763,THE LADY.,I thank you. Wear this gem--’twill make me feel
764,THE LADY.,That I am something to you when we part.
765,THE LADY.,But what the “silence?”
766,THE LADY.,
767,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
768,THE MAIDEN.,
769,THE MAIDEN.,Ten months (they seem years!)
770,THE MAIDEN.,Since Willie joined the army; and my heart
771,THE MAIDEN.,Bore it until his letters ceased; then tears
772,THE MAIDEN.,Would come--would come!
773,THE MAIDEN.,
774,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
775,THE LADY.,
776,THE LADY.,Why should the letters cease?
777,THE LADY.,
778,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
779,THE MAIDEN.,
780,THE MAIDEN.,"I know not; I could only pray for peace,"
781,THE MAIDEN.,"And his return. No doubt he could not write,"
782,THE MAIDEN.,Perplexed with many duties; his the care
783,THE MAIDEN.,"Of a thronged camp, where, ever in his sight,"
784,THE MAIDEN.,The new recruits are drilled.
785,THE MAIDEN.,
786,THE MAIDEN.,THE LADY (_thinking_).
787,THE MAIDEN.,
788,THE MAIDEN.,"Oh, faith most rare! (_Speaks._) Had you no doubts?"
789,THE MAIDEN.,
790,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
791,THE MAIDEN.,
792,THE MAIDEN.,Why should I doubt? We are
793,THE MAIDEN.,"Betrothed--the same forever, near or far!"
794,THE MAIDEN.,--He knew my trust
795,THE MAIDEN.,Was boundless as his own.
796,THE MAIDEN.,
797,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
798,THE LADY.,
799,THE LADY.,But still you must
800,THE LADY.,In reason have known something--must have heard
801,THE LADY.,Or else imagined--
802,THE LADY.,
803,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
804,THE MAIDEN.,
805,THE MAIDEN.,For three months no word
806,THE MAIDEN.,Until this letter; from its page I learned
807,THE MAIDEN.,That my poor Willie had but just returned
808,THE MAIDEN.,"To the brigade, when struck down unaware."
809,THE MAIDEN.,It seems he had been three months absent.
810,THE MAIDEN.,
811,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
812,THE LADY.,
813,THE LADY.,--Where?
814,THE LADY.,
815,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
816,THE MAIDEN.,
817,THE MAIDEN.,They did not say. I hope to bear him home
818,THE MAIDEN.,"To-morrow; for in truth I scarce could come,"
819,THE MAIDEN.,"So ill my mother, and so full my hands"
820,THE MAIDEN.,"Of household cares; but, Willie understands."
821,THE MAIDEN.,
822,THE MAIDEN.,THE LADY (_thinking_).
823,THE MAIDEN.,
824,THE MAIDEN.,_Ciel!_ faith like this is senseless--or sublime!
825,THE MAIDEN.,Which is it?
826,THE MAIDEN.,(_Speaks_). But three months--so long a time--
827,THE MAIDEN.,
828,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
829,THE MAIDEN.,
830,THE MAIDEN.,"Were it three years, ’twould be the same. The troth"
831,THE MAIDEN.,"We plighted, freely, lovingly, from both"
832,THE MAIDEN.,Our true hearts came.
833,THE MAIDEN.,
834,THE MAIDEN.,THE LADY (_thinking_).
835,THE MAIDEN.,
836,THE MAIDEN.,And may as freely go--
837,THE MAIDEN.,Such things have happened! But I will not show
838,THE MAIDEN.,One glimpse of doubt to mar the simple trust
839,THE MAIDEN.,She cherishes; as soon my hand could thrust
840,THE MAIDEN.,A knife in the dove’s breast.
841,THE MAIDEN.,"(_Speaks._) You’ll find him, dear;"
842,THE MAIDEN.,All will go well; take courage. Not severe
843,THE MAIDEN.,His wound?
844,THE MAIDEN.,
845,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
846,THE MAIDEN.,
847,THE MAIDEN.,Not unto death; but fever bound
848,THE MAIDEN.,"His senses. When the troops moved on, they found"
849,THE MAIDEN.,A kindly woman near by Benton’s Mill;
850,THE MAIDEN.,"And there he lies, poor Willie, up above"
851,THE MAIDEN.,"In her small loft, calling, in tones that thrill:"
852,THE MAIDEN.,"“Oh, come to me, my love, my love, my love!”--"
853,THE MAIDEN.,Here is his picture.
854,THE MAIDEN.,
855,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
856,THE LADY.,
857,THE LADY.,What! ’tis Meredith!
858,THE LADY.,The girl is mad!--Give it me forthwith!
859,THE LADY.,How came you by it?
860,THE LADY.,
861,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
862,THE MAIDEN.,
863,THE MAIDEN.,"Madam, you will break"
864,THE MAIDEN.,The chain. I beg--
865,THE MAIDEN.,
866,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
867,THE LADY.,
868,THE LADY.,Here is some strange mistake.
869,THE LADY.,This picture shows me Meredith Reid.
870,THE LADY.,
871,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
872,THE MAIDEN.,
873,THE MAIDEN.,"Yes, Reid"
874,THE MAIDEN.,"Is Willie’s name; and Meredith, indeed,"
875,THE MAIDEN.,Is his name also--Meredith Wilmer. I
876,THE MAIDEN.,"Like not long names, so gave him, lovingly,"
877,THE MAIDEN.,The pet name Willie.
878,THE MAIDEN.,
879,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
880,THE LADY.,
881,THE LADY.,O ye Powers above!
882,THE LADY.,The “pet name Willie!” Would you try to chain
883,THE LADY.,Phœbus Apollo with your baby-love
884,THE LADY.,And baby-titles? Scarce can I refrain
885,THE LADY.,My hands from crushing you!--
886,THE LADY.,"You are that girl,"
887,THE LADY.,"Then, the boy’s fancy. Yes, I heard the tale"
888,THE LADY.,"He tried to tell me; but it was so old,"
889,THE LADY.,So very old! I stopped him with a curl
890,THE LADY.,"Laid playfully across his lips. “Nay, hold!"
891,THE LADY.,"Enough, enough,” I said; “of what avail"
892,THE LADY.,The rest? I know it all; ’tis e’er the same
893,THE LADY.,Old story of the country lad’s first flame
894,THE LADY.,That burns the stubble out. Now by this spell
895,THE LADY.,Forget it all.” He did; and it was well
896,THE LADY.,He did.
897,THE LADY.,
898,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
899,THE MAIDEN.,
900,THE MAIDEN.,"Never! oh, never! Though you prove"
901,THE MAIDEN.,"The whole as clear as light, I’d ne’er receive"
902,THE MAIDEN.,"One word. As in my life, so I believe"
903,THE MAIDEN.,In Willie!
904,THE MAIDEN.,
905,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
906,THE LADY.,
907,THE LADY.,Fool and blind! your God above
908,THE LADY.,Knows that I lie not when I say that he
909,THE LADY.,"You dwarf with your weak names is mine, mine, mine!"
910,THE LADY.,"He worships me--dost hear? He worships _me_,"
911,THE LADY.,"Me only! What art thou, a feeble child,"
912,THE LADY.,"That _thou_ shouldst speak of loving? Haste, aside,"
913,THE LADY.,Lest we should drown you in the torrent wild
914,THE LADY.,"Of our strong meeting loves, that may not bide"
915,THE LADY.,"Nor know your dying, even; feeble weed"
916,THE LADY.,Tossed on the shore--[_The maiden faints._
917,THE LADY.,Why could I not divine
918,THE LADY.,The truth at first? [_Fans her._
919,THE LADY.,"Fierce love, why shouldst thou kill"
920,THE LADY.,"This little one? The child hath done no ill,"
921,THE LADY.,"Poor wounded, broken blossom. I should pour"
922,THE LADY.,My gentlest pity--
923,THE LADY.,
924,THE LADY.,THE MAIDEN (_recovering_).
925,THE LADY.,
926,THE LADY.,"Madam, thanks; no more"
927,THE LADY.,Do I require your aid.
928,THE LADY.,
929,THE LADY.,THE LADY (_aside_).
930,THE LADY.,
931,THE LADY.,"How calm she seems,"
932,THE LADY.,How cold her far-off eyes! Poor little heart.
933,THE LADY.,"The pity of it! all its happy dreams,"
934,THE LADY.,With a whole life’s idolatry to part
935,THE LADY.,In one short moment.
936,THE LADY.,"(_Speaks._) Child, let us be friends;"
937,THE LADY.,"Not ours the fault, it is the work of Fate."
938,THE LADY.,"And now, before your hapless journey ends,"
939,THE LADY.,"Say, in sweet charity, you do not hate"
940,THE LADY.,"Me for my love. Trust me, I’ll tend him well;"
941,THE LADY.,"As mine own heart’s blood, will I care for him"
942,THE LADY.,Till strong again. Then shall he come and tell
943,THE LADY.,The whole to you--the cup from dregs to brim--
944,THE LADY.,"How, with undoubting faith"
945,THE LADY.,In the young fancy that he thought was love
946,THE LADY.,"For you, he came a-down the glittering path"
947,THE LADY.,Of Washington society; above
948,THE LADY.,"The throng I saw his noble Saxon head,"
949,THE LADY.,"Sunny with curls, towering among the rest"
950,THE LADY.,In calm security--scorn that is bred
951,THE LADY.,"Of virtue, and that largeness which your West"
952,THE LADY.,With its wide sweep of fields gives to her sons--
953,THE LADY.,"A certain careless largeness in the look,"
954,THE LADY.,As though a thousand prairie-miles it took
955,THE LADY.,Within its easy range.
956,THE LADY.,Ah! blindly runs
957,THE LADY.,"Our fate. We met, we two so far apart"
958,THE LADY.,"In every thought, in life, in soul, in heart--"
959,THE LADY.,"Our very beings clashed. He, fair, severe;"
960,THE LADY.,"I, dark and free; his days a routine clear,"
961,THE LADY.,"Lighted by conscience; I, in waking dream"
962,THE LADY.,"Of colors, music, warmth, the scents of flowers,"
963,THE LADY.,"The sweep of velvet, and the diamond’s gleam,"
964,THE LADY.,"A cloud of romance heavy on the air,"
965,THE LADY.,"The boudoir curtained from the light of day,"
966,THE LADY.,"Where all the highest came to call me fair,"
967,THE LADY.,And whispered vows I laughed in scorn away.
968,THE LADY.,Was it my fault that Nature chose to give
969,THE LADY.,"The splendid beauty of this hair, these eyes,"
970,THE LADY.,This creamy skin? And if the golden prize
971,THE LADY.,"Of fortune came to me, should I not live"
972,THE LADY.,In the rich luxury my being craved?
973,THE LADY.,"I give my word, I no more thought of time--"
974,THE LADY.,"Whether ’twas squandered, trifled with, or saved,"
975,THE LADY.,Than the red rose in all her damask prime.
976,THE LADY.,Each day I filled with joys full to the brim--
977,THE LADY.,"The rarest fruits and wines, the costliest lace,"
978,THE LADY.,"The ecstasy of music, every whim"
979,THE LADY.,"For some new folly gratified, the grace"
980,THE LADY.,"Of statues idealized in niches, touch"
981,THE LADY.,Of softest fabrics. Ah! the world holds much
982,THE LADY.,For those who love her; and I never heard
983,THE LADY.,In all my happy glowing life one word
984,THE LADY.,"Against her, till--he came!"
985,THE LADY.,"We met, we loved,"
986,THE LADY.,"Like flash of lightning from a cloudless sky,"
987,THE LADY.,"So sudden, strange, the white intensity--"
988,THE LADY.,Intensity resistless! Swift there moved
989,THE LADY.,"Within his heart a force unknown before,"
990,THE LADY.,That swept his being from that early faith
991,THE LADY.,"Across a sea, and cast it on the shore"
992,THE LADY.,Prone at my feet.
993,THE LADY.,He minded not if death
994,THE LADY.,"Came, so he could but gaze upon my face."
995,THE LADY.,
996,THE LADY.,"--But, bending where he lay (the youthful grace"
997,THE LADY.,"Of his strong manhood, in humility"
998,THE LADY.,"Prone, by love’s lightnings), so I bended me"
999,THE LADY.,"Down to his lips, and gave him--all!"
1000,THE LADY.,"Sweet girl,"
1001,THE LADY.,"Forgive me for the guiltless robbery,"
1002,THE LADY.,"Forgive him, swept by fateful Destiny!"
1003,THE LADY.,"He spoke of one, the child-love of his youth;"
1004,THE LADY.,"I told of my child-marriage. But, in truth,"
1005,THE LADY.,"No barrier, had it been a thousand-fold"
1006,THE LADY.,"Stronger than boyish promise, e’er could hold"
1007,THE LADY.,Natures like ours!
1008,THE LADY.,"You see it, do you not?"
1009,THE LADY.,You understand it all.
1010,THE LADY.,"--I had forgot,"
1011,THE LADY.,"But this the half-way town; the train runs slow,"
1012,THE LADY.,"No better place than this. But, ere you go,"
1013,THE LADY.,"Give me one silent hand-clasp, little pearl."
1014,THE LADY.,"I ask you not to speak, for words would seem"
1015,THE LADY.,"Too hard, too hard. Yet, some time, when the dream"
1016,THE LADY.,Of girlhood has dissolved before the heat
1017,THE LADY.,"Of real love, you will forgive me, sweet."
1018,THE LADY.,
1019,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1020,THE MAIDEN.,
1021,THE MAIDEN.,I fail to comprehend you. Go? Go where?
1022,THE MAIDEN.,
1023,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
1024,THE LADY.,
1025,THE LADY.,Back to your home; here waits the north-bound train;
1026,THE LADY.,’Twill bear you safely. To go on were pain
1027,THE LADY.,Most needless--cruel.
1028,THE LADY.,
1029,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1030,THE MAIDEN.,
1031,THE MAIDEN.,I am not aware
1032,THE MAIDEN.,That I have said aught of returning. Vain
1033,THE MAIDEN.,Your false and evil story. I have heard
1034,THE MAIDEN.,"Of such as you; but never, on my word"
1035,THE MAIDEN.,"As lady and as Christian, did I think"
1036,THE MAIDEN.,To find myself thus side by side with one
1037,THE MAIDEN.,Who flaunts her ignominy on the brink
1038,THE MAIDEN.,Of dark perdition!
1039,THE MAIDEN.,Ah! my Willie won
1040,THE MAIDEN.,The strong heart’s victory when he turned away
1041,THE MAIDEN.,"From your devices, as I _know_ he turned."
1042,THE MAIDEN.,Although you follow him in this array
1043,THE MAIDEN.,"Of sin, I _know_ your evil smiles he spurned"
1044,THE MAIDEN.,"With virtuous contempt--the son of prayers,"
1045,THE MAIDEN.,The young knight of the church! My bosom shares
1046,THE MAIDEN.,"His scorn; take back your ring, false woman. Go!"
1047,THE MAIDEN.,Move from my side.
1048,THE MAIDEN.,
1049,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
1050,THE LADY.,
1051,THE LADY.,"Dear Heaven, now I know"
1052,THE LADY.,How pitiless these Christians!
1053,THE LADY.,"Unfledged girl,"
1054,THE LADY.,"Your little, narrow, pharisaic pride"
1055,THE LADY.,Deserves no pity; jealousy’s wild whirl
1056,THE LADY.,"Excuse might be, since that is born of love;"
1057,THE LADY.,"But _this_ is scorn, and, by the God above,"
1058,THE LADY.,I’ll set you in your place!
1059,THE LADY.,Do _you_ decide
1060,THE LADY.,"The right and wrong for this broad world of ours,"
1061,THE LADY.,"Poor little country-child, whose feeble eyes"
1062,THE LADY.,Veiled o’er with prejudice are yet so wise
1063,THE LADY.,"That they must judge the earth, and call it good"
1064,THE LADY.,"Or evil as it follows their small rules,"
1065,THE LADY.,"The petty, narrow dogmas of the schools"
1066,THE LADY.,That hang on Calvin!
1067,THE LADY.,Doubtless prairie-flowers
1068,THE LADY.,Esteem the hot-house roses evil all;
1069,THE LADY.,But yet I think not that the roses should
1070,THE LADY.,Go into mourning therefor!
1071,THE LADY.,"Oh, the small,"
1072,THE LADY.,Most small foundation for a vast conceit!
1073,THE LADY.,Is it a merit that you never learned
1074,THE LADY.,But one side of this life? Because you dwelt
1075,THE LADY.,"Down in a dell, there were no uplands sweet,"
1076,THE LADY.,No breezy mountain-tops? _You_ never yearned
1077,THE LADY.,"For freedom, born a slave! You never felt"
1078,THE LADY.,"The thrill of rapture, the wild ecstasy"
1079,THE LADY.,"Of mere existence that strong natures know,"
1080,THE LADY.,"The deep and long-drawn breaths, the burning glow"
1081,THE LADY.,"Of blood that sunward leaps; but, in your dell,"
1082,THE LADY.,"You said: “This is the world. If all, like me,"
1083,THE LADY.,"Walked on this one straight line, all would go well!”"
1084,THE LADY.,O fool! O blind!
1085,THE LADY.,O little ant toiling along the ground!
1086,THE LADY.,You cannot see the eagle on the wind
1087,THE LADY.,Soaring aloft; and so you go your round
1088,THE LADY.,"And measure out the earth with your small line,"
1089,THE LADY.,An inch for all infinity! “Thus mine
1090,THE LADY.,Doth make the measure; thus it is.”
1091,THE LADY.,Proud girl!
1092,THE LADY.,You call me evil. There is not a curl
1093,THE LADY.,In all this loosened hair which is not free
1094,THE LADY.,From sin as your smooth locks. Turn; look at me!
1095,THE LADY.,I flout you with my beauty! From my youth
1096,THE LADY.,"Beside my mother’s chair, by God’s own truth,"
1097,THE LADY.,I’ve led a life as sinless as your own.
1098,THE LADY.,Your innocence is ignorance; but I
1099,THE LADY.,"Have seen the Tempter on his shining throne,"
1100,THE LADY.,And said him nay. You craven weaklings die
1101,THE LADY.,From fear of dangers I have faced! I hold
1102,THE LADY.,Those lives far nobler that contend and win
1103,THE LADY.,"The close, hard fight with beautiful, fierce Sin,"
1104,THE LADY.,"Than those that go untempted to their graves,"
1105,THE LADY.,Deeming the ignorance that haply saves
1106,THE LADY.,"Their souls, some splendid wisdom of their own!"
1107,THE LADY.,You fold
1108,THE LADY.,"Yourself in scornful silence? I could smile,"
1109,THE LADY.,"O childish heart, so free from worldly guile,"
1110,THE LADY.,Were I not angered by your littleness.
1111,THE LADY.,You judge my dress
1112,THE LADY.,The garb of sin? Listen. I sat and heard
1113,THE LADY.,The opera; by chance there fell a word
1114,THE LADY.,Behind me from a group of men who fill
1115,THE LADY.,Night after night my box. My heart stood still.
1116,THE LADY.,"I asked--they told the name. “Wounded,” they said,"
1117,THE LADY.,"“A letter in the journal here.” I read,"
1118,THE LADY.,"Faced them with level eyes; they did not know,"
1119,THE LADY.,"But wondered, caught the truth, to see me go"
1120,THE LADY.,Straight to my carriage. “Drive! The midnight train.”
1121,THE LADY.,"We reached it, breathless."
1122,THE LADY.,"Had I worn fair white,"
1123,THE LADY.,"A ballroom-robe, I’d do the same to gain"
1124,THE LADY.,One moment more of time.
1125,THE LADY.,
1126,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1127,THE MAIDEN.,
1128,THE MAIDEN.,And by what right--
1129,THE MAIDEN.,Are you his wife?
1130,THE MAIDEN.,
1131,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
1132,THE LADY.,
1133,THE LADY.,I am not; but to-night
1134,THE LADY.,"I shall be, if I live. Your scorn, poor child,"
1135,THE LADY.,"Is thrown away. Bound by his soldier’s oath,"
1136,THE LADY.,"I would not keep him. No Omphale I,"
1137,THE LADY.,"Though he be Hercules. We plighted troth,"
1138,THE LADY.,"And then, when called, he went from me--to die"
1139,THE LADY.,If need be. I remember that I smiled
1140,THE LADY.,When they marched by!
1141,THE LADY.,Love for my country burns
1142,THE LADY.,Within my heart; but this was love for him.
1143,THE LADY.,"I could not brook him, one who backward turns"
1144,THE LADY.,For loving wife; his passion must not dim
1145,THE LADY.,"The soldier’s courage stern. Then I had wealth,"
1146,THE LADY.,The golden wealth left me by that old man
1147,THE LADY.,Who called me wife for four short months; by stealth
1148,THE LADY.,"He won me, but a child; the quiet plan"
1149,THE LADY.,Was deftly laid. I do not blame him now.
1150,THE LADY.,My mother dead--one kind thought was to save
1151,THE LADY.,My budding youth from harm. The thoughtless vow
1152,THE LADY.,"I made was soon dissevered by the grave,"
1153,THE LADY.,And I was left alone. Since then I’ve breathed
1154,THE LADY.,"All pleasures as the flowers breathe in the sun,"
1155,THE LADY.,At heart as innocent as they; red-wreathed
1156,THE LADY.,"My careless life with roses, till the one"
1157,THE LADY.,"Came! Then the red turned purple deep, the hope"
1158,THE LADY.,Found itself love; the rose was heliotrope.
1159,THE LADY.,There needed much
1160,THE LADY.,To do with lawyers’ pens ere I could give
1161,THE LADY.,"My hand again; so that dear, longed-for touch"
1162,THE LADY.,Was set by me for the full-blooming day
1163,THE LADY.,When Peace shall drive the demon War away
1164,THE LADY.,"Forever. I was wrong. Oh, let him live,"
1165,THE LADY.,Kind God! Love shall be wronged no more--no more.
1166,THE LADY.,All my own heart’s life will I gladly pour
1167,THE LADY.,For one small hour of his.--Wait--wait--I fly
1168,THE LADY.,"To thee, my love, on swiftest wings! Thy cry"
1169,THE LADY.,The depths of grief too hot for tears doth move:
1170,THE LADY.,"“Oh, come to me, my love, my love, my love!”"
1171,THE LADY.,
1172,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1173,THE MAIDEN.,
1174,THE MAIDEN.,It was not you he called!
1175,THE MAIDEN.,
1176,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
1177,THE LADY.,
1178,THE LADY.,Ah! yes.
1179,THE LADY.,
1180,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1181,THE MAIDEN.,
1182,THE MAIDEN.,He is
1183,THE MAIDEN.,"_Not_ false; I’ll ne’er believe it, woman."
1184,THE MAIDEN.,
1185,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
1186,THE LADY.,
1187,THE LADY.,His
1188,THE LADY.,"The falseness of the pine-tree, felled, uptorn"
1189,THE LADY.,"By the great flood, and onward madly borne"
1190,THE LADY.,"With the wild, foaming torrent miles away.--"
1191,THE LADY.,No doubt he loved the violet that grew
1192,THE LADY.,In the still woods ere the floods came; he knew
1193,THE LADY.,Not then of roses!
1194,THE LADY.,
1195,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1196,THE MAIDEN.,
1197,THE MAIDEN.,"Cruel eyes, I say"
1198,THE MAIDEN.,But this to all your flashings--you have lied
1199,THE MAIDEN.,To me in all!
1200,THE MAIDEN.,
1201,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
1202,THE LADY.,
1203,THE LADY.,"Look, then, here at my side"
1204,THE LADY.,His letters--read them. Did he love me? Read!
1205,THE LADY.,"Aha! you flush, you tremble, there’s no need"
1206,THE LADY.,To show you more; the strong words blanch your cheek.
1207,THE LADY.,"See, here his picture; could I make it speak,"
1208,THE LADY.,"How it would kill you! Yes, I wear it there"
1209,THE LADY.,Close to my heart. Know you this golden hair
1210,THE LADY.,That lies beside it?
1211,THE LADY.,
1212,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1213,THE MAIDEN.,
1214,THE MAIDEN.,Should he now confess
1215,THE MAIDEN.,"The whole--yes, tell me all your tale was true,"
1216,THE MAIDEN.,"I would not leave him to you, sorceress!"
1217,THE MAIDEN.,I’d snatch him from the burning--I would sue
1218,THE MAIDEN.,His pardon down from heaven. I shall win
1219,THE MAIDEN.,"Him yet, false woman, and his grievous sin"
1220,THE MAIDEN.,Shall be forgiven.
1221,THE MAIDEN.,(_Bows her head upon her hands._) O God let him die
1222,THE MAIDEN.,Rather than live for one who doth belie
1223,THE MAIDEN.,All I have learned of Thee!
1224,THE MAIDEN.,
1225,THE MAIDEN.,_Train stops suddenly._--_Enter_ CONDUCTOR.
1226,THE MAIDEN.,
1227,CONDUCTOR.,CONDUCTOR.
1228,CONDUCTOR.,
1229,CONDUCTOR.,"The bridge is down,"
1230,CONDUCTOR.,The train can go no farther. Morgan’s band
1231,CONDUCTOR.,Were here last night! There is a little town
1232,CONDUCTOR.,"Off on the right, and there, I understand,"
1233,CONDUCTOR.,You ladies can find horses. Benton’s Mill
1234,CONDUCTOR.,Is but a short drive from Waunona Hill.--
1235,CONDUCTOR.,Can I assist you?
1236,CONDUCTOR.,
1237,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1238,THE MAIDEN.,
1239,THE MAIDEN.,Thanks; I must not wait. [_Exit._
1240,THE MAIDEN.,
1241,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
1242,THE LADY.,
1243,THE LADY.,Yes; that my basket--that my shawl. O Fate!
1244,THE LADY.,"How burdened are we women! Sir, you are"
1245,THE LADY.,Most kind; and may I trouble you thus far?
1246,THE LADY.,Find me the fleetest horses; I must reach
1247,THE LADY.,Waunona Hill this night. I do beseech
1248,THE LADY.,All haste; a thousand dollars will I give
1249,THE LADY.,For this one ride. [_Exeunt._
1250,THE LADY.,
1251,A SOLDIER.,A SOLDIER.
1252,A SOLDIER.,
1253,A SOLDIER.,"Say, boys, I’d like to live"
1254,A SOLDIER.,Where I could see that woman! I could fight
1255,A SOLDIER.,A regiment of rebels in her sight--
1256,A SOLDIER.,Couldn’t you?

1269,_THE DRIVE._,
1270,_THE DRIVE._,"O fair Kentucky! border-land of war,"
1271,_THE DRIVE._,Thou rovest like a gypsy at thy will
1272,_THE DRIVE._,Between the angry South and stubborn North.
1273,_THE DRIVE._,Across thy boundaries many times from far
1274,_THE DRIVE._,"Sweep Morgan’s men, the troopers bold who fill"
1275,_THE DRIVE._,"Ohio with alarm; then, marching forth"
1276,_THE DRIVE._,"In well-drilled ranks with flag, and fife, and drum,"
1277,_THE DRIVE._,"From camp and town the steady blue-coats come,"
1278,_THE DRIVE._,"March east, march west, march north, march south, and find"
1279,_THE DRIVE._,No enemy except the lawless wind.
1280,_THE DRIVE._,No sooner gone--Lo! presto through the glen
1281,_THE DRIVE._,Is heard the midnight ride of Morgan’s men:
1282,_THE DRIVE._,"They ford the rivers by the light of stars,"
1283,_THE DRIVE._,The ringing hoofs sound through the mountain-pass;
1284,_THE DRIVE._,They draw not rein until their glad huzzas
1285,_THE DRIVE._,Are echoing through the land of the Blue Grass.
1286,_THE DRIVE._,"--O lovely land,"
1287,_THE DRIVE._,"O swell of grassy billows far and near,"
1288,_THE DRIVE._,"O wild, free elms, whose swaying arms expand"
1289,_THE DRIVE._,"As if to clasp me, hold my love as dear"
1290,_THE DRIVE._,As thine own son! I hasten to his side--
1291,_THE DRIVE._,"Ye roads, lie smooth; ye streams, make safe the ford;"
1292,_THE DRIVE._,"O chivalrous Kentucky, help the bride"

1297,_THE DRIVE._,
1298,_THE DRIVE._,.... Can it be that girl
1299,_THE DRIVE._,Who rides in front? I thought her left behind
1300,_THE DRIVE._,In that small town. _Ciel!_ would I could hurl
1301,_THE DRIVE._,The slim thing down this bank! Would I could bind
1302,_THE DRIVE._,"Those prim, long-fingered, proper hands of hers"
1303,_THE DRIVE._,"Behind her drooping, narrow-shouldered back,"
1304,_THE DRIVE._,And send her home! A heart like that transfers
1305,_THE DRIVE._,"Its measured, pale affections readily,"
1306,_THE DRIVE._,If the small rules it calleth piety
1307,_THE DRIVE._,"Step in between them. Otherwise, the crack"
1308,_THE DRIVE._,Of doom would not avail to break the cord
1309,_THE DRIVE._,Which is not love so much as given word
1310,_THE DRIVE._,"And fealty, that conscientiousness"
1311,_THE DRIVE._,"Which weigheth all things be they more or less,"
1312,_THE DRIVE._,"From fold of ribbon to a marriage-vow,"
1313,_THE DRIVE._,With self-same scales of duty. Shall I now
1314,_THE DRIVE._,Ride on and pass her--for her horse will fail
1315,_THE DRIVE._,Before the hour is out? Of what avail
1316,_THE DRIVE._,Her journey?
1317,_THE DRIVE._,"(_Speaks._) Driver, press forward.--Nay, stop--"

1319,_THE DRIVE._,"I know not how to be ungenerous,"
1320,_THE DRIVE._,Though I may try--God knows I truly tried.
1321,_THE DRIVE._,What’s this upon my hand? Did a tear drop?

1331,THE MAIDEN.,
1332,THE MAIDEN.,She said me nay; then why am I not free

1335,THE MAIDEN.,(_Speaks._) Ho! driver--
1336,THE MAIDEN.,"(_Aside._) But, alas!"
1337,THE MAIDEN.,I cannot.
1338,THE MAIDEN.,"(_Speaks._) Child, my horses soon will pass"
1339,THE MAIDEN.,In spite of me; they are so fleet they need
1340,THE MAIDEN.,The curb to check them in their flying speed.
1341,THE MAIDEN.,Ours the same journey: why should we not ride
1342,THE MAIDEN.,Together?
1343,THE MAIDEN.,
1344,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1345,THE MAIDEN.,
1346,THE MAIDEN.,Never!

1349,THE LADY.,
1350,THE LADY.,Then I must abide
1351,THE LADY.,"By your decision.--Driver, pass."
1352,THE LADY.,(_Thinking._) I take
1353,THE LADY.,"Her at her word. In truth, for her own sake"
1354,THE LADY.,"’Twere charity to leave her, hasten on,"
1355,THE LADY.,"Find my own love, and with him swift be gone"
1356,THE LADY.,Ere she can reach him; for his ardor strong
1357,THE LADY.,"(Curbed, loyal heart, so long!),"
1358,THE LADY.,"Heightened by fever, will o’ersweep all bounds,"
1359,THE LADY.,And fall around me in a fiery shower
1360,THE LADY.,Of passion’s words.-- And yet--this inner power--
1361,THE LADY.,"This strange, unloving justice that surrounds"
1362,THE LADY.,"My careless conscience, _will_ not let me go!"
1363,THE LADY.,(_Speaks._) Ho!
1364,THE LADY.,"Driver, turn back."
1365,THE LADY.,"--Maiden, I ask again--"
1366,THE LADY.,I cannot take advantage. Come with me;
1367,THE LADY.,That horse will fail you soon--ask; both these men
1368,THE LADY.,"Will tell you so.--Come, child--we will agree"
1369,THE LADY.,"The ride shall count as naught; nay, when we reach"
1370,THE LADY.,"The farm-house, all shall be as though no speech"
1371,THE LADY.,Had ever passed between us--we will meet
1372,THE LADY.,Beside his couch as strangers.
1373,THE LADY.,(_Speaks._) There’s defeat
1374,THE LADY.,"For thee, O whispering tempter!"
1375,THE LADY.,
1376,THE LADY.,THE MAIDEN (_to the men_).
1377,THE LADY.,

1383,ONE OF THE MEN.,Yes.
1384,ONE OF THE MEN.,
1385,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1386,THE MAIDEN.,
1387,THE MAIDEN.,"Madam, then with you"
1388,THE MAIDEN.,I needs must ride.--I pray you take my share
1389,THE MAIDEN.,Of payment; it were more than I could bear
1390,THE MAIDEN.,To be indebted to you.
1391,THE MAIDEN.,
1392,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
1393,THE LADY.,
1394,THE LADY.,Nay--the sum
1395,THE LADY.,Was but a trifle.
1396,THE LADY.,"(_Aside._) Now forgive me, truth."
1397,THE LADY.,But was it not a trifle to such wealth--
1398,THE LADY.,Such wealth as mine?
1399,THE LADY.,(_Speaks._) Heard you that distant drum
1400,THE LADY.,Borne on the wind a moment? Ah! our youth
1401,THE LADY.,Is thrilled with the great pulses of this war.
1402,THE LADY.,How fast we live--how full each crowded hour
1403,THE LADY.,"Of hot excitements! Naught is done by stealth,"
1404,THE LADY.,The little secrecies of other days
1405,THE LADY.,Thrown to the winds; the clang and charge afar
1406,THE LADY.,"On the red battle-field, the news that sways"
1407,THE LADY.,"Now to, now fro, ’twixt victory and defeat;"
1408,THE LADY.,The distant cry of “Extra!” down the street
1409,THE LADY.,"In the gray dawnings, and our breathless haste"
1410,THE LADY.,To read the tidings--all this mighty power
1411,THE LADY.,"Hath burned in flame the day of little things,"
1412,THE LADY.,"Curled like a scroll--and now we face the kings,"
1413,THE LADY.,"The terrible, the glorious gods of war."
1414,THE LADY.,--The maid forgets her shyness; wherefore waste
1415,THE LADY.,One moment when the next may call him forth
1416,THE LADY.,Ne’er to return to her? The dear old North
1417,THE LADY.,May take her lover--but he shall not go
1418,THE LADY.,With lips unkissed to meet his Southern foe;
1419,THE LADY.,Her last embrace will cheer him on his round
1420,THE LADY.,"Now back, now forth, over the frozen ground"
1421,THE LADY.,Through the long night.
1422,THE LADY.,--And when the hasty word
1423,THE LADY.,"“Only one day; be ready, love,” is heard,"
1424,THE LADY.,"The soft consent is instant, and there swells"
1425,THE LADY.,Amid the cannonade faint wedding-bells
1426,THE LADY.,"From distant village; then, as swift away"
1427,THE LADY.,The soldier bridegroom rides--he may not stay.
1428,THE LADY.,"And she?--She would not keep him, though the tears"
1429,THE LADY.,"Blind her sweet eyes that follow him, and fears"
1430,THE LADY.,"Crowd her faint heart and take away her breath,"
1431,THE LADY.,As on her white robe falls the shade of Death
1432,THE LADY.,That waits for him at Shiloh!
1433,THE LADY.,O these days!
1434,THE LADY.,"When we have all gone back to peaceful ways,"
1435,THE LADY.,Shall we not find sweet Peace a little dull?
1436,THE LADY.,--You do not speak.

1443,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
1444,THE LADY.,
1445,THE LADY.,Of love?--Pray--what is love?
1446,THE LADY.,How should a woman love?--Although we hate
1447,THE LADY.,"Each other well, we need not try to prove"
1448,THE LADY.,Our hate by silence--for there is a fate
1449,THE LADY.,"Against it in us women; speak we must,"
1450,THE LADY.,"And ever shall until we’re turned to dust,"
1451,THE LADY.,Nay--I’m not sure but even then we talk
1452,THE LADY.,From grave to grave under the churchyard-walk--
1453,THE LADY.,Whose bones last longest--whose the finest shroud--
1454,THE LADY.,And--is there not a most unseemly crowd
1455,THE LADY.,In pauper’s corner yonder?
1456,THE LADY.,--You are shocked?
1457,THE LADY.,"You do not see, then, that I only mocked"
1458,THE LADY.,At my own fears--as those poor French lads sang
1459,THE LADY.,"Their gayest songs at the red barricade,"
1460,THE LADY.,Clear on the air their boyish voices rang
1461,THE LADY.,"In chorus, even while the bayonet made"
1462,THE LADY.,An end of them.--He may be suffering now--
1463,THE LADY.,He may be calling--
1464,THE LADY.,There! I’ve made a vow
1465,THE LADY.,"To keep on talking. So, then--tell me, pray,"
1466,THE LADY.,How should a woman love?
1467,THE LADY.,
1468,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1469,THE MAIDEN.,
1470,THE MAIDEN.,I can but say

1481,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
1482,THE LADY.,
1483,THE LADY.,"I, too; my faith is absolute. We share"
1484,THE LADY.,That good in common. I believe his love
1485,THE LADY.,"Is great as mine, and mine--oh, could I prove"
1486,THE LADY.,"My love by dying for him, far too small"
1487,THE LADY.,"The test; I’d give my love, my soul, my all,"
1488,THE LADY.,"In life, in death, in immortality,"
1489,THE LADY.,Content in hell itself (if there be hells--
1490,THE LADY.,"Which much I doubt)--content, so I could be"
1491,THE LADY.,With him!
1492,THE LADY.,
1493,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1494,THE MAIDEN.,
1495,THE MAIDEN.,Is it a woman’s tongue that tells
1496,THE MAIDEN.,"This blasphemy? When I said faith, I meant"
1497,THE MAIDEN.,A faith in God.
1498,THE MAIDEN.,
1499,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
1500,THE LADY.,
1501,THE LADY.,And God is love! He sent
1502,THE LADY.,"This love that fills my heart. Oh, most divine--"
1503,THE LADY.,"Oh, nearest to him of all earthly things,"
1504,THE LADY.,A love that passeth self--a love like mine
1505,THE LADY.,That passeth understanding. The bird sings
1506,THE LADY.,Because it is the only way he knows
1507,THE LADY.,To praise his Maker; and a love that flows
1508,THE LADY.,"Like mine is worship, too--a hymn that rolls"
1509,THE LADY.,"Up to the God of Love, who gave us souls"
1510,THE LADY.,To love with. Then the hidden sacrifice;
1511,THE LADY.,"It formed a part of worship once, and I"
1512,THE LADY.,Do hold it now the part that deepest lies
1513,THE LADY.,"In woman’s love, the dim sanctuary"
1514,THE LADY.,"Behind the veil, holy of holies, kept"
1515,THE LADY.,"E’en from the one she loves: all told, except"
1516,THE LADY.,This mystic feeling which she may not know
1517,THE LADY.,How to express in words--the martyr’s glow
1518,THE LADY.,Idealized--the wish to give him joy
1519,THE LADY.,"Through her own suffering, and so destroy"
1520,THE LADY.,All part that self might play--to offer pure
1521,THE LADY.,"Her love to her heart’s idol. Strange, obscure,"
1522,THE LADY.,"Sacred, but mighty, is this longing; I"
1523,THE LADY.,Can feel though not define it. I would die
1524,THE LADY.,To make him happy!
1525,THE LADY.,
1526,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
1527,THE MAIDEN.,
1528,THE MAIDEN.,As his happiness

1533,THE MAIDEN.,
1534,THE MAIDEN.,"“As,” said she? Heart, but this is fabulous,"
1535,THE MAIDEN.,This calm security of hers!
1536,THE MAIDEN.,"(_Speaks._) Why, child,"
1537,THE MAIDEN.,"Hast never heard of passion, and its wild,"
1538,THE MAIDEN.,"Impetuous, unreasoning assault"
1539,THE MAIDEN.,On souls that know not their own depths? The fault
1540,THE MAIDEN.,"Not his: he was but young, he did not know"
1541,THE MAIDEN.,Himself. Might he not love me even though
1542,THE MAIDEN.,Thou wert the best? Have pity! I appeal
1543,THE MAIDEN.,To all the woman in thee. Dost thou feel
1544,THE MAIDEN.,That one touch of his hand would call the blood
1545,THE MAIDEN.,Out from thy heart in an o’erwhelming flood
1546,THE MAIDEN.,To meet it?

1557,THE LADY.,"To me. Ah, let me kneel; thus I implore"

1993,THE LADY.,"“I love thee--oh, I love thee, Meredith?”"
1994,THE LADY.,I would not that her childish grief should break

1999,THE LADY.,I catch the radiance!
2000,THE LADY.,"She is not thine,"
2001,THE LADY.,Thou art not hers. The boyish pledge wherewith
2002,THE LADY.,She strives to hold thee was the radiancy
2003,THE LADY.,"Of early dawn, which now the mighty sun"
2004,THE LADY.,Hath swept away in fervent heat; nor thee
2005,THE LADY.,Nor her it binds. Her pretty youth will run
2006,THE LADY.,Its swift course to some other love; Fate
2007,THE LADY.,"Ne’er lets such sweet maids pine, though they may try;"
2008,THE LADY.,"A few months lent to tearful constancy,"
2009,THE LADY.,"The next to chastened sorrow, slow decline"

2011,THE LADY.,"Of making some one happy, though at cost"
2012,THE LADY.,"Of sweet self-sacrifice, which soon is lost"
2013,THE LADY.,"In that content which, if not real love,"
2014,THE LADY.,Looks strangely like it! But why should I prove
2015,THE LADY.,"What thou dost know already, freed from time"
2016,THE LADY.,"And finite bonds, my darling?"
2017,THE LADY.,"Love sublime,"
2018,THE LADY.,Art thou not God? Then let him down to me
2019,THE LADY.,For one short moment. See! in agony
2020,THE LADY.,I cling to the cold body; let him touch
2021,THE LADY.,Me once with this dear hand; it is not much
2022,THE LADY.,"I ask--one clasp, one word."
2023,THE LADY.,What! nothing? Then
2024,THE LADY.,I call down vengeance on this God of men
2025,THE LADY.,"Who makes us at his will, and gives us hearts"
2026,THE LADY.,"Only to rend them in a hundred parts,"
2027,THE LADY.,"And see them quiver--bleed! I, creature, dare"
2028,THE LADY.,To call aloud for justice; my despair
2029,THE LADY.,Our great far-off Creator doth arraign
2030,THE LADY.,Before the bar to answer for the pain
2031,THE LADY.,I suffer now. It is too much--too much!
2032,THE LADY.,O woe! woe! woe! the human soul can such
2033,THE LADY.,"Intensity of sorrow not withstand,"
2034,THE LADY.,"But, lifting up on high its fettered hand,"
2035,THE LADY.,"Can only cry aloud in agony,"
2036,THE LADY.,"And blindly, wildly curse its God and die!"
2037,THE LADY.,"How dare you take,"
2038,THE LADY.,"You Death, my love away from me? The old,"
2039,THE LADY.,"The weak, the loveless, the forlorn, were there"
2040,THE LADY.,"In crowds, and none to miss them. But your cold"
2041,THE LADY.,"And heartless eye did mark that he was fair,"
2042,THE LADY.,And that I loved him? From your dreadful hold
2043,THE LADY.,"I snatch my darling, and he yet shall wake"
2044,THE LADY.,"From out your sleep by my caresses. See,"
2045,THE LADY.,"See how I love him! Ah, shall I not win"
2046,THE LADY.,"His life back with my lips, that lovingly"
2047,THE LADY.,"Do cling to his? And, though you do begin"
2048,THE LADY.,"Your icy work, these arms shall keep him warm--"
2049,THE LADY.,"Nay, more: my loving verily disarm"
2050,THE LADY.,"E’en you, O King of Terrors! You shall turn"
2051,THE LADY.,And give him back to me; a heart shall burn
2052,THE LADY.,Under your ribs at last from very sight
2053,THE LADY.,"Of my fierce, tearless grief."
2054,THE LADY.,--O sorry plight
2055,THE LADY.,"Of my poor darling in this barren room,"
2056,THE LADY.,Where only his gold curls do light the gloom!
2057,THE LADY.,"But we will change all that. This evening, dear,"
2058,THE LADY.,"Shall be our bridal: wilt thou take me, here,"
2059,THE LADY.,And thus?--in this array--this falling hair--
2060,THE LADY.,"Crushed robes? And yet, believe me, I am fair"
2061,THE LADY.,As ever.
2062,THE LADY.,"Love, love, love! oh, speak to me!"
2063,THE LADY.,I will not listen in my misery
2064,THE LADY.,If thy heart beat--
2065,THE LADY.,God! it is cold!
2066,THE LADY.,[_Falls to the floor._
2067,THE LADY.,
2068,THE LADY.,_Enter the_ SURGEON.

2076,SURGEON.,
2077,SURGEON.,"Thanks, sir. But sorrow cannot kill."
2078,SURGEON.,"Would that it could! Nay, I sit by his side--"
2079,SURGEON.,Thus. Now tell all--all--all.
2080,SURGEON.,
2081,SURGEON.,SURGEON.
2082,SURGEON.,
2083,SURGEON.,You cannot hide
2084,SURGEON.,The deadly faintness that has paled your cheek;

2086,SURGEON.,
2087,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
2088,THE LADY.,
2089,THE LADY.,"Nothing. Nothing can avail,"
2090,THE LADY.,Good sir; my very heart’s blood has turned pale.
2091,THE LADY.,"Struck by God’s lightning, do you talk to me"
2092,THE LADY.,"Of faintness? Only tell your tale--speak, speak;"
2093,THE LADY.,You saw him die?
2094,THE LADY.,
2095,SURGEON.,SURGEON.
2096,SURGEON.,
2097,SURGEON.,I did; right tranquilly
2098,SURGEON.,"He passed away this morning, with your name"
2099,SURGEON.,Upon his lips--for you are Helena?
2100,SURGEON.,
2101,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
2102,THE LADY.,
2103,THE LADY.,I am.
2104,THE LADY.,
2105,SURGEON.,SURGEON.
2106,SURGEON.,
2107,SURGEON.,I saw your picture.
2108,SURGEON.,"(_Aside._) Yes, the same."
2109,SURGEON.,"Hair, eyes. What Titian tints!"
2110,SURGEON.,(_Speaks._) He made me lay
2111,SURGEON.,Your letters and your picture on his heart
2112,SURGEON.,Before he died; he would not from them part
2113,SURGEON.,For e’en one moment.
2114,SURGEON.,
2115,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
2116,THE LADY.,
2117,THE LADY.,"Lift them not, they’re mine;"
2118,THE LADY.,My hand alone must touch the holy shrine
2119,THE LADY.,Of love and death where the poor relics lie--
2120,THE LADY.,"Darling (_bends, and kisses the letters_), because you loved them!"
2121,THE LADY.,"Let them die,"
2122,THE LADY.,"Go to the grave with him, there on his breast,"
2123,THE LADY.,Where I would gladly die too--be at rest
2124,THE LADY.,Forever.--And he spake of me?
2125,THE LADY.,
2126,SURGEON.,SURGEON.
2127,SURGEON.,
2128,SURGEON.,He said
2129,SURGEON.,"That you would come, for he had sent you word."
2130,SURGEON.,
2131,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
2132,THE LADY.,
2133,THE LADY.,"I ne’er received it; ’twas by chance I heard,"
2134,THE LADY.,A passing chance.
2135,THE LADY.,
2136,SURGEON.,SURGEON.
2137,SURGEON.,
2138,SURGEON.,The lines were down--
2139,SURGEON.,
2140,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
2141,THE LADY.,
2142,THE LADY.,And may
2143,THE LADY.,"They never rise again that failed that day,"
2144,THE LADY.,And left him dying here! Go on; he said--
2145,THE LADY.,
2146,SURGEON.,SURGEON.
2147,SURGEON.,
2148,SURGEON.,"That you would come, and grieved that o’er his head"
2149,SURGEON.,The turf might close ere you could reach his side
2150,SURGEON.,And give him one last kiss.
2151,SURGEON.,And then--he died.
2152,SURGEON.,
2153,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
2154,THE LADY.,
2155,THE LADY.,No more?
2156,THE LADY.,
2157,SURGEON.,SURGEON.
2158,SURGEON.,
2159,SURGEON.,"No more. Ah, yes, one other thing:"
2160,SURGEON.,"Short time before, he feebly bade me bring"
2161,SURGEON.,That package on the table--but ’tis torn--
2162,SURGEON.,"Some one has opened it! It looked well worn,"
2163,SURGEON.,"In old, unbroken foldings when I brought"
2164,SURGEON.,It from his satchel. Who could thus have wrought
2165,SURGEON.,On other’s property?
2166,SURGEON.,
2167,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
2168,THE LADY.,
2169,THE LADY.,The owner.--Then
2170,THE LADY.,He said--
2171,THE LADY.,
2172,SURGEON.,SURGEON.
2173,SURGEON.,
2174,SURGEON.,"To give it you, for you would know"
2175,SURGEON.,"Its history, and where it swift should go;"
2176,SURGEON.,The name was writ within.
2177,SURGEON.,
2178,SURGEON.,THE LADY (_aside_).
2179,SURGEON.,
2180,SURGEON.,"Yes, love; amen!"
2181,SURGEON.,Be it according to thy wish.
2182,SURGEON.,(_Speaks._) Pray take
2183,SURGEON.,"This fee, good sir. I would that for his sake--"
2184,SURGEON.,Your kindness to him--I could send your name
2185,SURGEON.,Ringing through all the West in silver fame.--
2186,SURGEON.,"At dawn, you said, the burial? Then leave"
2187,SURGEON.,Me here alone with him. I well believe
2188,SURGEON.,You’ll show me further kindness. Speak no word
2189,SURGEON.,Beyond your doctor’s art to that poor child
2190,SURGEON.,Who weeps below. I would not that she heard
2191,SURGEON.,Aught more of grief.
2192,SURGEON.,[_Exit_ SURGEON.
2193,SURGEON.,Ah! all my passion wild
2194,SURGEON.,Has gone; now come the softening woman tears.--
2195,SURGEON.,"Forgive me, great Creator, that I spake"
2196,SURGEON.,In my sharp agony. O do thou take
2197,SURGEON.,The bitterness from out my soul; I know
2198,SURGEON.,"Naught, but thou knowest all! Then let my woe,"
2199,SURGEON.,"The poor blind woe we short-lived mortals bear,"
2200,SURGEON.,Be my sad plea.--
2201,SURGEON.,"I knew, through my despair,"
2202,SURGEON.,You loved me to the last. Death had no fears
2203,SURGEON.,"For you, my love; you met him with my name,"
2204,SURGEON.,As talisman of the undying flame
2205,SURGEON.,That leaps o’er the black chasm of the grave
2206,SURGEON.,"And mounts to heaven. But I will not rave,"
2207,SURGEON.,When you died softly.
2208,SURGEON.,
2209,SURGEON.,Ah! you love me there
2210,SURGEON.,As well as here. God never made me fair
2211,SURGEON.,"For nothing; now, I know the gift he gave"
2212,SURGEON.,"That I might take my place with you at last,"
2213,SURGEON.,"Equal in loveliness, though years had passed"
2214,SURGEON.,"Since you first breathed the air above the skies,"
2215,SURGEON.,The beauty-giving air of paradise.
2216,SURGEON.,"Fair are you now, my love, but not like me:"
2217,SURGEON.,"Mine is the goddess-bloom, the rarity"
2218,SURGEON.,"Of perfect loveliness; yours, the bright charm"
2219,SURGEON.,"Of strong young manhood, whose encircling arm"
2220,SURGEON.,"Could bend me like a reed. Oh, for one clasp"
2221,SURGEON.,Of that strong arm!--
2222,SURGEON.,Hist! was not that the hasp
2223,SURGEON.,Of the old door below? She comes; I hear
2224,SURGEON.,Her light step on the stair.
2225,SURGEON.,"Darling, no fear"
2226,SURGEON.,Need trouble you upon your couch; to me
2227,SURGEON.,A sacred trust this gentle girl shall be
2228,SURGEON.,Through life. Did you not love her once?
2229,SURGEON.,
2230,SURGEON.,THE MAIDEN (_entering_).
2231,SURGEON.,
2232,SURGEON.,I pray
2233,SURGEON.,Forgiveness thus to leave you here so long;
2234,SURGEON.,"I did not mean it, but I swooned away"

2236,SURGEON.,
2237,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
2238,THE LADY.,
2239,THE LADY.,Thanks. There was no wrong;
2240,THE LADY.,I liked the vigil.
2241,THE LADY.,
2242,THE LADY.,THE MAIDEN (_going to the bedside_).
2243,THE LADY.,
2244,THE LADY.,Sweet those eyes--the brow
2245,THE LADY.,How calm! I would not bring life to him now
2246,THE LADY.,E’en if I could; gone to his God--at rest
2247,THE LADY.,From all earth’s toil.
2248,THE LADY.,"Dear love, upon thy breast"
2249,THE LADY.,I lay my hand; I yield thee back to Him
2250,THE LADY.,"Who gave thee to me; and, if thou hast wrought"
2251,THE LADY.,"Wrong to our troth in deed, or word, or thought,"
2252,THE LADY.,"I now forgive thee. Sleep in peace; the dim,"
2253,THE LADY.,Dark grave has its awaking.
2254,THE LADY.,As the hart
2255,THE LADY.,"Longed for the water-brooks, so have I yearned"
2256,THE LADY.,"For token, Willie, that thy love returned"
2257,THE LADY.,To me at last. Lo! now I can depart
2258,THE LADY.,"In peace.--My picture, letters! Thou wast true,"
2259,THE LADY.,"Wast true to me, thank God!--"
2260,THE LADY.,"(_Turning._) Madam, to you"
2261,THE LADY.,I owe apology.
2262,THE LADY.,
2263,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
2264,THE LADY.,
2265,THE LADY.,Never! But throw
2266,THE LADY.,Your gentle arms around me--thus. And so

2268,THE LADY.,
2269,THE MAIDEN.,THE MAIDEN.
2270,THE MAIDEN.,
2271,THE MAIDEN.,But I’ve robbed you--you

2274,THE MAIDEN.,
2275,THE LADY.,THE LADY.
2276,THE LADY.,
2277,THE LADY.,"Sweet doubter, yes;"
2278,THE LADY.,"I grant thee all. But, as I kneel, O bless"

2395,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Soft in his curling hair, the fragrance sweet"
2396,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Of the wild-brier roses incense made,"
2397,_EARTH TO EARTH._,And one bird sang a chant.

2399,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"This quiet body going to its grave,"

2407,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Shall soon be clean forgotten.--
2408,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Earth to earth!
2409,_EARTH TO EARTH._,
2410,_EARTH TO EARTH._,The lady walked alone. Her glorious hair
2411,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Still held its roses crushed; the chill despair
2412,_EARTH TO EARTH._,That numbed her being could not dim the light
2413,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Of all her flashing jewels, nor the bright"
2414,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Sheen of her draperies.
2415,_EARTH TO EARTH._,The summer sun
2416,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Rose in the east and showed the open grave
2417,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Close at her feet; but, ere the work begun--"
2418,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Lowering the clay (O proud humanity!
2419,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Is this thy end?)--she gentle signal gave
2420,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"To lay the body down, and, by its side"
2421,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Kneeling, kissed brow and lips, fondly as bride"
2422,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Might kiss; and, as she clung there, secretly"
2423,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"A shining ring left on the cold dead hand,"
2424,_EARTH TO EARTH._,And covered it from view; then slowly rose
2425,_EARTH TO EARTH._,And gave them place.
2426,_EARTH TO EARTH._,But ere the tightening rope
2427,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Had done its duty, o’er the eastern slope"
2428,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Rode horsemen, and the little group of those"
2429,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Who gazed, drew back, and eyed askance the band."
2430,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"They turned, they drew their reins--a sight to see"
2431,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Indeed, this lady clad so royally,"
2432,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Alone, beside a grave."
2433,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"She raised her eyes,"
2434,_EARTH TO EARTH._,And the bold leader bared his lofty head
2435,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Before her to his saddle-bow; the guise
2436,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Of bold, rough-riding trooper could not hide"
2437,_EARTH TO EARTH._,The gallant grace that thus its homage paid
2438,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"To so much beauty. At his signal mute,"
2439,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"The little band, Kentucky’s secret pride,"
2440,_EARTH TO EARTH._,His daring followers in many a raid
2441,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"And many a hair-breadth ’scape, made swift salute,"
2442,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"And, all dismounting, honor to the dead"
2443,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Paid silently, not knowing ’twas their own"
2444,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Bullet by night that laid him there:--so strange
2445,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"The riddle of men’s life, its little range"
2446,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Thick with crossed fates, though each one stands alone"
2447,_EARTH TO EARTH._,To mortal eyes.
2448,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"The rope slackened, the clay"
2449,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Had reached its final resting-place. Then she
2450,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Who loved him best, in all her rich array"
2451,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Stepped forth, and, kneeling, with her own hands cast"
2452,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"The first clod on his heart. “I yield to thee,"
2453,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Nature, my only love. Oh, hold him fast"
2454,_EARTH TO EARTH._,As sacred trust!
2455,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"‘Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust!’”"
2456,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Then, rising, with her lovely face upturned"
2457,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"To the clear sky, where the first sunbeams burned,"
2458,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"“I know that my Redeemer lives,” she said;"
2459,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"“He that believes on him, though he were dead,"
2460,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Yet shall he live!”
2461,_EARTH TO EARTH._,And so passed from their sight.
2462,_EARTH TO EARTH._,
2463,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"The troopers ride away,"
2464,_EARTH TO EARTH._,On to the south; the men who fill the grave
2465,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"With hurried shovelfuls in whispers say,"
2466,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"“That’s part of Morgan’s band.” And one, a slave,"
2467,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Looks down the road, and mutters: “That was him--"
2468,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Young Cap’en Morgan’s self! These eyes is dim,"
2469,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"But they knows Morgan! Morgan!--what! why, bless"
2470,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Your hearts, _I_ know him, and I know Black Bess--"
2471,_EARTH TO EARTH._,’Twas Bess he rode.”
2472,_EARTH TO EARTH._,
2473,_EARTH TO EARTH._,And now the work is done;
2474,_EARTH TO EARTH._,On from their northern raid the troopers pass
2475,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Fleet to the south; the grave is filled, and gone"
2476,_EARTH TO EARTH._,Even the slave.
2477,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Forever still, alone,"
2478,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Her letters and bright picture on his breast,"
2479,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Her sparkling spousal-ring on his dead hand,"
2480,_EARTH TO EARTH._,The golden-haired young soldier lies at rest
2481,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Where o’er his head the steely shadows pass,"
2482,_EARTH TO EARTH._,"Far in the fair Kentucky border-land,"

2634,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"January and finished in the February number of APPLETONS’ JOURNAL, is of"
2635,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],such remarkable quality as to deserve a wider reading than it is likely
2636,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"to have. To read it in completeness gives one, beyond its faults--which"
2637,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],are principally those of imperfect versification and a certain formality
2638,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"of phraseology--a sense of power in character-drawing (coloring enough,"
2639,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"too, for that matter), in dramatic situation and in expression of deep"
2640,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"emotions, which is rarely met with. The contrast between the magnificent"
2641,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],woman of the world and the Puritan country-girl is done in true masterly
2642,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"way, and that the one should continue faithful to love through her life,"
2643,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"though still reigning in social royalty, while the other marries as"
2644,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"piously as she mourned, and puts away the dead youth’s memory"
2645,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],forever--is perfectly true to their natures. To present such marked
2646,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"types in rivalry, and show the self-abnegation in the rich nature and"
2647,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"the innocent self-absorption of the narrow nature, was well worth while."
2648,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"The poem would make quite a little book, and better merits such"

2657,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"something, we think, which takes the piece out of the category of"
2658,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"ordinary magazine-work, and entitles it to special attention. The poem"

2662,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],"strong, dramatic, and full of the flavor of the soil. The two women who"
2663,[REPRINTED FROM APPLETONS’ JOURNAL.],gave it its name are types of two well-defined classes of American
