44,PREFACE.,
45,PREFACE.,"In submitting the present edition of the following poem, entitled"
46,PREFACE.,"_Terrible Tractoration_, to the American public, the author complies"
47,PREFACE.,"not only with solicitations of personal friends, but with expressed"
48,PREFACE.,wishes of many gentlemen to whom he is personally a stranger. They say
49,PREFACE.,"that by stripping folly of some of its disguises, and plucking the mask"
50,PREFACE.,"of deception from that impudent charlatanry, which encumbers the “march"
51,PREFACE.,"of improvement,” this burlesque production may be of service to mankind."
52,PREFACE.,
53,PREFACE.,"The origin of the poem entitled Tractoration, is as follows: In the"
54,PREFACE.,"year 1801 the author, (who is a native of Walpole, New Hampshire,)"
55,PREFACE.,"was in London, on business as an agent for a Company in Vermont. In"
56,PREFACE.,"that Metropolis he became acquainted with Mr Benjamin Douglas Perkins,"
57,PREFACE.,"proprietor of a patent right for making and using certain implements,"
58,PREFACE.,called Metallic Tractors. These were said to cure diseases in all
59,PREFACE.,"or nearly all cases of topical inflammation, by conducting from the"
60,PREFACE.,"diseased part the surplus of electric fluid which in such cases, causes"
61,PREFACE.,"or accompanies the morbid affection. At the request of that gentleman,"
62,PREFACE.,the author undertook to make the Tractors the theme of a satirical
63,PREFACE.,effusion in Hudibrastic verse. This was originally intended for the
64,PREFACE.,"corner of a newspaper, but subsequently in the first edition enlarged"
65,PREFACE.,to a pamphlet of about fifty pages royal octavo. It was published in
66,PREFACE.,"the summer of 1803, well received, and a second edition called for in"
67,PREFACE.,"less than two months. A new and enlarged edition was put to press, and"
68,PREFACE.,met with a favorable reception both from the public and the reviewers.
69,PREFACE.,"From the success which attended Tractoration, the author was induced to"
70,PREFACE.,"publish in London a small volume of _Original Poems_, which was well"
71,PREFACE.,received and favorably reviewed.
72,PREFACE.,
73,PREFACE.,The author never would have written a syllable intended to give
74,PREFACE.,"Metallic Tractors favorable notoriety, had he not believed in their"
75,PREFACE.,"efficacy. As conductors of what is called animal electricity, and in"
76,PREFACE.,"principle allied to Galvanic stimulants, even their _modus operandi_,"
77,PREFACE.,"he thought, might be in a great measure explained. Respectable English"
78,PREFACE.,"Reviews and other periodicals gave favorable notices of the Tractors,"
79,PREFACE.,and Mr Perkins exhibited to the author testimonials in favor of those
80,PREFACE.,"implements from several professors of universities, many regular"
81,PREFACE.,"physicians, surgeons, clergymen, and others, men of as high standing"
82,PREFACE.,and influence as any in community.
83,PREFACE.,
84,PREFACE.,But although the author was willing to aid the proprietor of the
85,PREFACE.,"tractors, he did not confine himself to topics connected with those"
86,PREFACE.,"implements. He made use of Tractoration as the title, and the tractors"
87,PREFACE.,"as the apology for a poem, in which he essayed to paint"
88,PREFACE.,
89,PREFACE.,----“every idle thing
90,PREFACE.,Which Fancy finds in her excursive flight.”
91,PREFACE.,
92,PREFACE.,"Although many of the subjects alluded to, or animadverted on were"
93,PREFACE.,"intended to be satirized, others were introduced merely to give them"
94,PREFACE.,"notoriety, or honorable mention in a humorous way; to _laugh with_"
95,PREFACE.,"rather than to _laugh at_ the inventors, and rather to _advertise_ than"
96,PREFACE.,"to _stigmatise_ their inventions, &c. Persons of this description will"
97,PREFACE.,"perceive our objects, appreciate our motives, and recollect that Dr"
98,PREFACE.,"Caustic, by virtue of a figure in rhetoric, called _irony_, can speak"
99,PREFACE.,"one thing and mean another, without uttering falsehood."
100,PREFACE.,
101,PREFACE.,The author conceives that he was fortunate as regards the plan of
102,PREFACE.,"_Tractoration_. _Dr Caustic_, who may be styled the _hero_ of the"
103,PREFACE.,"poem, is represented as a visionary, eccentric, would-be philosopher,"
104,PREFACE.,endeavoring to effect “grand discoveries and inventions” of most
105,PREFACE.,"“immense utility,” but had received so little encouragement that he"
106,PREFACE.,was impelled by necessity to petition the Royal College of Physicians
107,PREFACE.,"in London, for relief from penury, and assistance in his projects. In"
108,PREFACE.,"pursuance of this plan, every thing novel, singular, relating to any"
109,PREFACE.,"human pursuit, it was competent for Dr Caustic to make the object of"
110,PREFACE.,discussion or animadversion.
111,PREFACE.,
112,PREFACE.,"The miscellaneous poems, which, in this little volume succeed"
113,PREFACE.,"_Tractoration_, are, in part, selected from a volume first published"
114,PREFACE.,"in London, and partly from poems written in this country since"
115,PREFACE.,the author’s return from Europe. He hopes not to be condemned for
116,PREFACE.,"unpardonable egotism, if he quotes a passage or two from English and"
117,PREFACE.,American reviews relative to his poetical productions. If a traveller
118,PREFACE.,"produces passports, or a candidate for office exhibits recommendations,"
119,PREFACE.,"we do not condemn him for pride, nor chastise him for presumption."
120,PREFACE.,
121,PREFACE.,"The Gentleman’s Magazine, published in London, Jan. 1804, contains a"
122,PREFACE.,"long notice of _Tractoration_, from which the following passages are"
123,PREFACE.,extracted:
124,PREFACE.,
125,PREFACE.,"“In the first Canto the author, in an inimitable strain of"
126,PREFACE.,"irony, ridicules those pretended discoveries and inventions"
127,PREFACE.,of certain pseudo-philosophers both of the natural and moral
128,PREFACE.,"class, which have no tendency to meliorate the condition of"
129,PREFACE.,"man.” After many extracts from the work, and encomiums on"
130,PREFACE.,"each of the four cantos, the reviewers conclude, “Whatever"
131,PREFACE.,"may be the merits of the Metallic Tractors, or the demerits"
132,PREFACE.,"of their opponents, we have no hesitation to pronounce this"
133,PREFACE.,performance to be far superior to the ephemeral productions of
134,PREFACE.,"ordinary dealers in rhyme. The notes, which constitute more"
135,PREFACE.,"than half the book, are not behind the verse in spirit. Who"
136,PREFACE.,the author can be we have not the least conception; but from
137,PREFACE.,the intimate acquaintance he discovers with the different
138,PREFACE.,"branches of medical science, we should imagine him to be"
139,PREFACE.,"some jolly son of Galen, who, not choosing to bestow all his"
140,PREFACE.,"arts upon his PATIENTS, has humanely applied a few"
141,PREFACE.,ESCHAROTICS for the benefit of his brethren.”
142,PREFACE.,
143,PREFACE.,The following is extracted from a review written by the Hon. Daniel
144,PREFACE.,"Webster, while a student at law in Boston."
145,PREFACE.,
146,PREFACE.,"“In commending CHRISTOPHER CAUSTIC, we are only"
147,PREFACE.,subscribing to the opinions expressed by the people of another
148,PREFACE.,country. To be behind that country in our appreciation of his
149,PREFACE.,"merits, were a stigma; it is very pardonable to go beyond it."
150,PREFACE.,"National vanity may be a folly, but national ingratitude is"
151,PREFACE.,a crime. Terrible Tractoration was successful on its first
152,PREFACE.,"appearance in England, and as yet seems to have lost none of"
153,PREFACE.,its popularity. It belongs to that class of productions which
154,PREFACE.,"have the good fortune to escape what Johnson angrily, but too"
155,PREFACE.,"justly, denominates the general conspiracy of human nature"
156,PREFACE.,against cotemporary merit.”
157,PREFACE.,
158,PREFACE.,"_Monthly Anthology for April, 1805._"
159,PREFACE.,
160,PREFACE.,"The eminence of Mr Webster, whose acquisitions as a scholar are"
161,PREFACE.,"scarcely exceeded by his qualifications as a statesman, is our apology"
162,PREFACE.,for exhibiting the above testimony of his approbation.
163,PREFACE.,
164,PREFACE.,"We might add to the above, other extracts from about twenty English and"
165,PREFACE.,"American Reviewers, in which the poems contained in this little volume"
166,PREFACE.,have been taken notice of with much commendation; but we hope the work
167,PREFACE.,may meet a favorable reception without such extraneous assistance.
168,PREFACE.,
169,PREFACE.,In the present edition of Tractoration several new subjects are
170,PREFACE.,introduced and thrown into the crucible of Dr Caustic. Among these are
171,PREFACE.,"Phrenology, Abolition, Amalgamation, Temperance, Reformation, &c. &c."
172,PREFACE.,"These parts were written expressly for this edition of Tractoration,"
173,PREFACE.,"were intended to “shoot folly as it flies,” and adapt the strictures of"
174,PREFACE.,satire to the topics of the times.

2802,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,then called burning; and the fluid so entering and acting is called

2811,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,so as to consider these two effects as the _product of modifications of
2812,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"the same body_, is entitled to much more attention. It is established"
2813,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,on a great number of experiments; it naturally and simply explains most
2814,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"of the phenomena; and it agrees with the sublime economy of nature,"
2815,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,which multiplies effects much more than the bodies which produce them.
2816,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
2817,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"“Fire,” he continues, “is disengaged, and shows itself in the form of"
2818,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"_heat_, when it is gently and slowly driven out of bodies into the"
2819,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,composition of which it entered; but it shines in the form of _light_
2820,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"when it flies out of compounds, in a very compressed state, by a swift"
2821,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,motion.
2822,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
2823,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"“According to this ingenious hypothesis, _caloric_ may become _light_,"
2824,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,and _light_ on the other hand may become _caloric_. For this purpose
2825,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,it is only necessary that the first should assume more rapidity in its
2826,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"motion, and the second undergo a diminution of velocity.” _Nicholsons’"

2828,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,

2830,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"which is the same as heat, may also be identified with _electricity_."
2831,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
2832,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,Here I shall produce the authority of a writer in the Encyclopædia
2833,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Britannica, who appears to be a very sound philosopher. Under the title"
2834,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Electricity, article 83, you will find that gunpowder has been fired by"
2835,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,the electric blast; from which the writer reasons as follows.
2836,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
2837,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"“As it therefore appears, that the electric fluid, when it moves"
2838,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,through bodies either with great rapidity or in very great quantity
2839,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"will set them on fire, _it seems scarce disputable_, that this fluid"
2840,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"is the same with the _element of fire_. This being once admitted, the"
2841,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,source from whence the electric fluid is derived into the earth and
2842,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"atmosphere must be exceedingly evident, being no other than the sun"
2843,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"or source of light itself.” The writer then proceeds to show, that an"
2844,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"iron wire has been melted by the discharge of a battery of electricity,"
2845,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"and furnishes proofs which must convince the most incredulous, of the"
2846,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,correctness of his theory.
2847,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
2848,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,Thus far we have proceeded triumphantly in making it abundantly
2849,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"evident that light, heat, and electricity are the same in substance;"
2850,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,so that if your worships will permeate this subject with due retention
2851,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"and some small share of true philosophical perspicacity, you will find"
2852,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"that heat and electricity are the dregs or sediment of light, and by"
2853,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"digesting Dr Black’s theory of latent heat, you will find that the"
2854,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"matter of heat, light, and electricity exists in very vast abundance in"
2855,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,all bodies and substances.
2856,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
2857,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,We next will prove that Galvanism is a modification of electricity.
2858,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Here we will advert to the theory of Galvani and Aldini, as stated by"
2859,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"C. H. Wilkinson, lecturer on Galvanism in Soho square, Member of the"
2860,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Royal College of Surgeons, &c. &c. This gentleman informs us, that “the"
2861,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"animal body is a description of _Leyden phial_, or magic battery, in"
2862,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"one part of which there is an excess of electricity, and in the other"
2863,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,a deficiency. _The conducting body communicates the fluid of the part
2864,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,where it is abundant to the part_ where it is defective; and in this
2865,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"passage of the electricity, the muscular contractions are obtained in"
2866,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,the same way as the discharges are produced by the Leyden phial or
2867,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,magic batteries. As the _conducting bodies_ in electricity are the sole
2868,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"agents in the discharge of the Leyden phial, so the same bodies alone"
2869,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,serve likewise to excite muscular contractions.” _Wilkinson’s Elements
2870,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"of Galvanism_, p. 82."
2871,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
2872,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,We next will prove that Perkins’s points are the proper conductors of
2873,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,animal electricity. From a specification which Mr Perkins published
2874,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"in the Repertory of Arts, it would seem that _zinc_ is the principal"
2875,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,ingredient in the tractors.
2876,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
2877,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"“Zinc,” says Fourcroy, “is a conductor of electricity like all other"
2878,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"metals, and nothing particular has hitherto been discovered in it with"
2879,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"respect to this property; however, the _powerful manner in which it"
2880,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,effects the sensibility of the human body in Galvanic experiments seems
2881,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,to give it herein a sort of prerogative_ or pre-eminence over other
2882,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"metallic substances. If we place a plate of zinc under the tongue,"
2883,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"and cover the upper surface of this organ with another metal, and"
2884,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"especially a piece of gold or silver, and then incline the extremity"
2885,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"of this last, so as to approach it to the plate of zinc, at the moment"
2886,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"when the two metals come into contact with each other, the person who"
2887,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"performs the experiments feels a very perceptible pricking sensation,"
2888,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"heat, irritation, and a sort of acerb taste in the tongue, almost"
2889,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"always accompanied with a _momentous_ glare, or luminous circle, which"
2890,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,suddenly appears before his eyes. No metal produces this singular
2891,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,effect with such force as zinc is observed to do.”
2892,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
2893,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,This animal electricity is likewise a modification of what we call
2894,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"_animal spirits_, and may be termed the _stimulus of society_. That"
2895,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"this was well known to the wisest of men, is evident from this adage"
2896,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,of Solomon: “Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance
2897,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,of his friend.” The want of a proper communication among animal
2898,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,Leyden phials is the cause of the gloom of the _solitaire_. The wish
2899,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,to partake of the benefits of the stimulus of society makes man a
2900,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"gregarious animal, and induces the human race to congregate in large"
2901,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"cities, and to be fond of routs, balls, assemblies, in which the"
2902,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,aforesaid human electric phials are beaming _animal electricity_ in
2903,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"every direction, and thus a flow of animal spirits is communicated by a"
2904,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,pleasing contagion to all present.
2905,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
2906,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,When we see an animal Leyden phial superabounding with animal
2907,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"electricity, we say it is a _spirited animal_. When said animal happens"
2908,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"to be a hero, a tiger, an irritated ram cat, or a black snake intent"
2909,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"on his game, visible flashes of electricity will blaze from the eyes,"
2910,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"and communicate very sensible shocks to a spectator. Thus the Gaul,"
2911,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"who was commanded to cut off the head of Marius, a celebrated Roman"
2912,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"general, and a personage full of the most _positive sort of animal"
2913,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"electricity_, received such a _stroke_ of lightning from the battery"
2914,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"of that hero’s head, and at the same time was so _thunderstruck_ with"
2915,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"the exclamation of “_Tune, homo, audes occidere Caium Marium?_” that"
2916,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,the dagger dropped bloodless from the hands of the ruthless assassin.
2917,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Thus Alexander, when hampered in the chief city of the Oxydracæ,"
2918,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,kept his foes at a distance by the fire that flashed from his eyes
2919,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,in whole torrents of animal electricity. How often do we see a
2920,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Congressional spouter, or an itinerant field preacher _electrize_ a"
2921,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,large assembly by repeated discharges of this mysterious fluid. In all
2922,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"cases of fanaticism it is mistaken for the fire of devotion, and causes"
2923,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"grimaces, contortions, convulsions, and other strange symptoms, which,"
2924,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"however, are easily accounted for by the theory of the “animal Leyden"
2925,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,phial.”
2926,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,
2927,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"But the prettiest experiments ever made with animal electricity, I"
2928,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,have seen sometimes exhibited by a female philosopher to a levee
2929,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"of her admirers. On such occasions, the lady’s eyes seem to be"
2930,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"fountains of _animal electricity_. This electricity, however, is not"
2931,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"_vitreous_ and _resinous_, but _positive_ and _negative_. The former"
2932,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"expressed by a _glance of approbation_, and the latter by a _flash of"
2933,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,disdain_. The different effects which discharges of these different
2934,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,kinds of electricity exhibit in the subjects of experiment may be
2935,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,rated among the most wonderful of phenomena. The former transports a
2936,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"man, Southey-like, to “the atmosphere of the highest of all possible"
2937,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"heavens,” the latter sinks him “down! down! to the Domdaniel cave at"
2938,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,the roots of the ocean.” But as this is a branch of natural philosophy
2939,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"to which, for forty years, past I have not paid the least attention,"
2940,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"I shall not attempt further to instruct your worships therein, but"
2941,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,refer you to the experiments so delectably set forth in the poems of
2942,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,"Little, Johannes Bonefonius, Secundus, and other adepts in that curious"
2943,ADDITIONAL NOTES.,science.

5881,FOOTNOTES:,(in London) to publish to the world the effects of his chemical
5882,FOOTNOTES:,studies. But not having taken the necessary precaution of addressing
5883,FOOTNOTES:,"himself to the College of Physicians for their license, he fell under"
5884,FOOTNOTES:,their displeasure; and being some time in the year 1600 summoned before
5885,FOOTNOTES:,"the president and censors, he _confessed_ that he had practised physic"
5886,FOOTNOTES:,"in London for six months, and _had cured twenty persons or more of"

6317,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,Now as to _infants_. Whoever has been in the way of an acquaintance
6318,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,with some of the more musical sort of these little gentry (like my
6319,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,seven last darlings for instance) and has been serenaded with the
6320,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"dulcet sonatas of their warbling strains, will not be disposed to deny"
6321,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,their powers on the imagination of _others_. I have known the delusion
6322,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"practised so effectually by these young conjurers, that I have myself"
6323,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"_imagined_ my head was actually aching most violently, even on the"
6324,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,point of cracking open; but on going beyond the reach of their magic
6325,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"spell, that is, out of hearing, my head has been as free from pain as"
6326,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"it necessarily must be at this moment, while I am penning this lucid"
6327,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"performance. Now, I maintain it to be most unphilosophical, and totally"
6328,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"opposite to certain new principles in ethics, which I shall establish"
6329,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"in a future publication, to suppose that infants should be able to"
6330,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"impart either pleasure or pain, by operating on the imagination, and"
6331,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"not themselves possess a large share of that imagination, by the aid of"
6332,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,which they operate to so much effect upon others.
6333,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,
6334,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"Next come _dogs_. Dr Shaw, in his _Zoology_, vol. i. p. 289, informs"
6335,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"us, “that a dog belonging to a nobleman of the Medici family always"
6336,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"attended his master’s table, changed the plates for him, carried him"
6337,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"his wine in a glass placed on a salver, without spilling the _smallest_"
6338,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"drop.” The celebrated Leibnitz mentions another, a _subject_ of the"
6339,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"elector of Saxony, _who_ could discourse in an “intelligible manner,”"
6340,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"especially on “tea, coffee, and chocolate;” whether in Greek, Latin,"
6341,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"German, or English, however, he has not stated; but Dr Shaw, alluding"
6342,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"to the same dog, says, undoubtedly under the influence of prejudice,"
6343,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"“he was somewhat of a truant, and did not willingly exert his talents,"
6344,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,being rather pressed into the service of literature.”
6345,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,
6346,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"Indeed, our greatest naturalists assure us, that this animal is far"
6347,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,before the human species in every ennobling quality. Buffon makes man
6348,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,a very devil compared with the dog; and had he come directly to the
6349,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"point, I presume he would have told us that the dog is one link above"
6350,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"man in the great chain from the fossil to the angel. “Without the dog,”"
6351,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"says Buffon, “how could man have been able to tame and reduce other"
6352,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"animals into slavery? To serve his own safety, it was necessary to make"
6353,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,friends among those animals whom he found capable of attachment. _The
6354,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,fruit of associating with the dog_ was the conquest and _the peaceable
6355,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,possession of the earth_. The dog will always preserve his empire. He
6356,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"reigns at the head of a flock, and makes himself _better_ understood"
6357,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"than the voice of the shepherd” (well he might, for it appears he"
6358,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"is more knowing, more powerful, and more just.) “Safety, order, and"
6359,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"discipline, are the fruits of his vigilance and activity. They are a"
6360,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"people submitted to his management, whom he conducts and protects, and"
6361,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,against whom he never employs force but for the preservation of peace
6362,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"and good order.” _Barr’s Buffon_, vol. v. p. 302."
6363,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,
6364,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"It is to me somewhat remarkable that _theorizing_ Frenchmen, many of"
6365,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"whose discoveries are scarcely less important than my own, cannot"
6366,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,make them apply in such a manner as to effect some _practical good_
6367,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"in society. Buffon discovered that a dog was a species of demi-god,"
6368,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,and appears on the point of worshipping this great Anubis of the
6369,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"Egyptians. Voltaire tells us, that Frenchmen are half monkey and half"
6370,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"tiger, and everybody knows that the one is insufferably mischievous,"
6371,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,and the other infinitely ferocious. Now it is surprising that these
6372,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,philosophers could not contrive to improve the breed by a little of
6373,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"the _canine_ blood. Indeed, I should advise them to import some of our"
6374,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"Bond street male _puppies_, to be paired with French female _monkeys_,"
6375,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,and I will venture to assert that there will be very little of the
6376,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"_tiger_ perceivable in their offspring. And since a dog, as Buffon"
6377,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"says, “reigns with so much dignity at the head of a flock, will always"
6378,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"preserve his empire, _never employs force but for the preservation"
6379,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"of peace and good order_,” and is endowed with so many other great"
6380,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"qualifications, which seem to denote him to be a proper personage"
6381,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"to wield the sceptre of dominion, I would seriously advise the abbe"

6383,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,Republic (which it is said he has already begun to manufacture) so to
6384,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"organize the executive branch, that at least one of the consuls should"
6385,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,be a true blooded English bull-dog.
6386,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,
6387,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,After the ample proof I have now given of the infinite superiority of
6388,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"the dog to man, when his merits are fairly estimated, which it is very"
6389,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"difficult for us, being interested, to do without prejudice, I shall"
6390,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"take it for granted, that he must possess all the brilliancy even of a"
6391,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"poet’s imagination, and therefore that he is far _more_ likely to be"

6402,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,its inability to achieve what he most readily effected. Ten long
6403,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,years was the whole power of Greece engaged in an ineffectual siege
6404,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"of far-famed Troy. The bravest of armies, commanded by heroes allied"
6405,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"to the gods, assailed the foe in vain. At this disheartening period"
6406,“A WILDERNESS OF SUNS!”,"stepped forth a _wooden_ horse, and promised a victory, provided his"
