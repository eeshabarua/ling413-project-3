46,NOTE,_The occasion for this little volume is the celebration of the centenary
47,NOTE,of Whittier’s birth. The sketch of his life aims to present the chief
48,NOTE,formative influences which affected his career and determined the
49,NOTE,character of his poetry. The poems have been chosen with the intention
50,NOTE,"of illustrating, first, the circumstances of Whittier’s boyhood and the"
51,NOTE,"themes to which his poetic imagination naturally turned, then the"
52,NOTE,"political and social struggle which engrossed so many of his years, and"
53,NOTE,finally that mood of devout resting and waiting in which his long life
54,NOTE,closed._

126,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
127,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
128,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"The loneliness of the homestead in which Whittier was born, on December"
129,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"17, 1807, has been described by the poet himself and emphasized by his"
130,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"biographers. It is a solitary spot, even to-day. The farmhouse, built by"
131,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the poet’s great-great-grandfather in 1688, has been preserved by the"
132,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,affectionate solicitude of the Whittier Homestead Association. After the
133,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,ravages of fire and of time it has been scrupulously restored. The
134,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"old-fashioned garden, the lawn sloping to the brook, the very"
135,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"stepping-stones, the beehives, the bridle-post, the worn door-stone, the"
136,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"barn across the road, even the surrounding woods of pine and oak, are"
137,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"all, as nearly as may be, precisely what they were a hundred years ago."
138,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,The shadow of Job’s Hill still darkens the pleasant little stream and
139,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,the narrow meadows of the homestead. In the dusk of August evenings the
140,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,deer come out to feed among the alders. The neighborhood remains
141,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,sparsely settled. No other house is within sight or hearing. Even in
142,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"summer the rural quiet is scarcely broken, and the winter landscape"
143,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,makes an almost sombre impression of physical seclusion.
144,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
145,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,The intellectual isolation of the poet’s youth has likewise been
146,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,impressed upon every reader of “Snow-Bound.” The books in that Quaker
147,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,farmhouse were few and unattractive. The local newspaper came once a
148,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,week. The teachers of the district school often knew scarcely more
149,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,literature than their scholars. In the Friends’ meeting-house at
150,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Amesbury, which the Whittiers faithfully attended, there was little of"
151,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,that intellectual stimulus which the sermons of an highly educated
152,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,clergy then offered to the orthodox. The hour of the New England
153,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,lyceum—that curiously effective though short-lived popular
154,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"university—had not yet come. Yet our own generation, bewildered by far"
155,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"too many newspapers, magazines, and books, is apt to forget that a few"
156,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,vitalizing ideas may more than make good the lack of printed matter.
157,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Whittier, who was to become the poet of Freedom, felt even in boyhood,"
158,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"in that secluded valley of the Merrimac, the pulse of the great European"
159,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"movement of emancipation which has transformed, and is still"
160,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"transforming, our modern world. “My father,” he wrote afterwards, “was"
161,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"an old-fashioned Democrat, and really believed in the Preamble of the"
162,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Bill of Rights which reaffirmed the Declaration of Independence.” In his
163,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,poem “Democracy” he reasserts his own and his father’s faith: —
164,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
165,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"“Oh, ideal of my boyhood’s time!"
166,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"The faith in which my father stood,"
167,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Even when the sons of Lust and Crime
168,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Had stained thy peaceful courts with blood!”
169,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
170,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Not even the terrors of the French Revolution, it seems, could shake the"
171,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,silent John Whittier’s steadfast belief in the natural rights of man. He
172,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"entertained in the old farmhouse William Forster, the distinguished"
173,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,British advocate of abolition. He transmitted to his boys a hatred of
174,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,“priests and kings” which befitted the descendants of forbears who had
175,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,felt the weight of the displeasure of the Puritan theocracy. Not that
176,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the Whittiers were agitators: they were taciturn, self-respecting"
177,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"landholders, who—in the phrase which a famous American poet, also of"
178,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Quaker stock, afterward applied to himself—wore their hats as they"
179,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"pleased, indoors and out. But the Whittiers were so used to quiet"
180,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,independence that it never occurred to them to brag of it.
181,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
182,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"This moral freedom of the New England Quakers, touched as it was with"
183,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the humanitarian passion of the later eighteenth century, was the poet’s"
184,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"spiritual heritage. Judged by material standards, his lot was one of"
185,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,hardship. The Whittier farm was both rocky and swampy. Only the most
186,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,stubborn toil could wring from it a livelihood. In the harsh labor of
187,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the farm the two boys helped as best they could, but John Greenleaf was"
188,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"slender and delicate, and suffered life-long injury by attempting tasks"
189,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,beyond his strength. The winters were like iron; underclothing was
190,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,almost unknown; the houses were poorly warmed and the churches not at
191,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"all; and the food, in farmers’ homes, lacked variety and was ill-cooked."
192,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Though the poet’s body never recovered from these privations of his
193,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"youth, the sufferings grew light when, in middle and later life, he"
194,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,weighed them against the happiness of home affection and the endless
195,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"pleasures of a boy’s life out of doors. “The Barefoot Boy,”"
196,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"“Snow-Bound,” and “In School-Days” tell the story more charmingly and"
197,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,with more truth than it can ever be told in prose. Few households are
198,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,better known to American readers than the inmates of the ancient
199,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,homestead under Job’s Hill. In the “Flemish pictures” of the gifted son
200,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"we behold the reticent, laborious father, the benignant mother,—like"
201,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Goethe’s mother, a natural story-teller,—the gracious maiden aunt, the"
202,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"uncle with his “prodigies of rod and gun,” the grave elder sister, and"
203,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the brilliant Elizabeth. These, with the boyish schoolmaster and the"
204,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"“half-welcome” casual guest, are still grouped for us before the great"
205,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"hearth in the ample living-room, waiting"
206,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
207,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"“Until the old, rude-furnished room"
208,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Burst, flower-like, into rosy bloom;”—"
209,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
210,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,a bloom that never fades from the memory of the born New Englander.
211,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Indeed, such was Whittier’s fidelity to the impressions made upon him in"
212,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"his youth, so unerring was his instinct for what was truly"
213,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"characteristic of the time and place, that these poems written about his"
214,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"boyhood portray, with a vividness rarely equalled in our literature, not"
215,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"only a mode of outward life, but a type of thought and feeling which"
216,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,possesses a permanent significance to all who would understand the
217,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,American mind.
218,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
219,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"It was easier for Whittier, after all, to picture the East Haverhill"
220,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,homestead and its other inmates than to draw the portrait of himself in
221,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"youth. We know that he was tall, frail, clear-colored, with those"
222,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,wonderful dark “Bachiler eyes” which now prove not to have been true
223,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Bachiler eyes at all. He was shy,—with a painful shyness which lasted"
224,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"throughout his life,—but he was prouder than a cavalier. Consciousness"
225,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,of intellectual power came to him early; behind him was a long line of
226,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"clean-lived farmers whose lips, although “to caution trained” by Quaker"
227,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"breeding, could speak decisively when there was need. Poverty had taught"
228,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,him that respect and sympathy for the poor which is one of the noblest
229,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,forms of class-pride. It would have been hard to find in all New England
230,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,a country boy whose mind was so perfectly prepared for the visitation of
231,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"a master-poet; and the poet, by some special gift of fortune, proved to"
232,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,be Robert Burns.
233,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
234,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,The story of that revealing experience is familiar enough: how a “pawky”
235,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,wandering Scotchman sang “Bonny Doon” and “Highland Mary” and “Auld Lang
236,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Syne” over his mug of cider in the Whittier kitchen; and then how Joshua
237,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Coffin, the boy’s first schoolmaster, loaned him that copy of Burns"
238,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,which proved to be his passport to the wonder-world:—
239,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
240,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,“I saw through all familiar things
241,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,The romance underlying;
242,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,The joys and griefs that plume the wings
243,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Of Fancy skyward flying.”
244,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
245,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"He had already scribbled verses upon the beam of his mother’s loom, and"
246,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"like the boy Alfred Tennyson, only two years younger than himself, in"
247,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the far-away Lincolnshire rectory, he had loved to fill his slate with"
248,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,rhymes. But from the moment that he read Burns this boyish delight in
249,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"mere jingling sounds deepened into a sense that he, too, might become a"
250,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,poet. At sixteen he was composing with extraordinary fluency and with
251,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,considerable skill. At eighteen he had written verses which his sister
252,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Mary thought good enough to be printed, and a poem which she sent"
253,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"surreptitiously to William Lloyd Garrison, the twenty-year-old editor of"
254,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the “Newburyport Free Press,” was accepted and published on June 8,"
255,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,1826. This printing of “The Exile’s Departure” in the poet’s corner of a
256,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,struggling local newspaper was a fateful event for Whittier. Everybody
257,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,knows the instant and generous interest aroused in the youthful editor:
258,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"how he drove out to East Haverhill, unearthed his bashful poet,—who was"
259,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"at that moment crawling under the barn after a stolen hen’s nest,—and"
260,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,urged his father to give Greenleaf something better than a district
261,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"schooling. “Sir, poetry will not give him bread!” exclaimed John"
262,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Whittier, as sternly as Carlyle’s father might have said it. But the"
263,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"upshot was that the gaunt lad got his term at the Haverhill Academy,"
264,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,paying his way by making shoes.
265,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
266,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"He continued to write poems in astonishing profusion, taught school"
267,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"himself for a term in his native township, then took a final term at the"
268,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Academy, and at twenty-one the ways were parting before his feet. A"
269,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,scheme for the publication of his poems by subscription had failed. His
270,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,health seemed too frail for effective farm labor. His ignorance of the
271,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"classics, as well as his lack of funds, barred the doors of a college"
272,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"course. He decided to earn his bread by journalism, and became at the"
273,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,end of his twenty-first year the editor of “The American Manufacturer”
274,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,in Boston. The choice was significant. For three years he had been
275,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"heralded as an unlettered “poet,” a sort of local phenomenon who was"
276,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"possibly destined, as Garrison had prophesied, to rank “among the bards"
277,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"of his country.” Yet here he was, turning, with a Yankee’s shrewd"
278,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"facility, to politics and affairs."
279,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
280,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"He was led, no doubt,—as in the more momentous crisis of 1833, when he"
281,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"obeyed Garrison’s call and turned Abolitionist,—by an instinct deeper"
282,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,than any conscious analysis of his powers. He knew that he had what he
283,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"called a “knack of rhyming,” and he had learned from Burns to find"
284,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,material for poetry all about him. Yet he possessed at this time but a
285,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,scanty equipment for the long road which a poet must travel. His
286,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,physical endowment was impoverished. That full-blooded life of the
287,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"senses, which taught Burns and Goethe at fourteen such secrets of human"
288,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"rapture and dismay, was impossible for the Quaker stripling. He was"
289,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,color-blind. His ear barely recognized a tune. The bodily sensations of
290,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"odor, taste, and touch are scarcely to be felt in his poetry. He was"
291,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"indeed “no Greek,” as Whitman said of him long afterward; and at the"
292,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"outset of his career, as at its close, he cared but little for"
293,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"literature as an art. To conceive of any of the arts as a religion, or"
294,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"as an embodiment, for sense perception, of the highest potencies of the"
295,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"human spirit, would have seemed almost blasphemous to this follower of"
296,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the “inward light.” He wrote to Lucy Hooper that a long poem, “unless"
297,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"consecrated to the sacred interests of religion and humanity, would be a"
298,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,criminal waste of life.” Parthenon and Pantheon were in his eyes less
299,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"significant and memorable than Pennsylvania Hall, the Abolitionist"
300,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"headquarters in Philadelphia. In an editorial in “The Freeman” in 1838,"
301,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"prefacing a reprint of “A Psalm of Life,” which had just been published"
302,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"in the New York “Knickerbocker,” Whittier declared: “It is very seldom"
303,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,that we find an article of poetry so full of excellent philosophy and
304,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"COMMON SENSE as the following. We know not who the author may be, but he"
305,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,or she is no common man or woman. These nine simple verses are worth
306,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"more than all the dreams of Shelley, and Keats, and Wordsworth. They are"
307,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,alive and vigorous with the spirit of the day in which we live—the moral
308,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,steam enginery of an age of action.”
309,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
310,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,One who could utter this amazing verdict upon the “Psalm of Life”
311,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,certainly seems less fitted for poetry than for journalism and politics:
312,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"and indeed Whittier’s aptitude for affairs, even at twenty-one, was"
313,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,extraordinary. His political editorials for the “Manufacturer”—a Clay
314,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,journal which advocated a protective tariff—were skilfully written from
315,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the first. Subsequent editorial engagements in Haverhill, Hartford, and"
316,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Philadelphia, although rendered brief by his wretched health,"
317,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,nevertheless widened his acquaintance and increased his self-confidence.
318,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"His judgment was canny. His knowledge of local conditions, at first in"
319,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"his native town and county, and afterward throughout New England and the"
320,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Eastern States, was singularly exact. He seemed to perceive, as by some"
321,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"actual visualization, how people were thinking and feeling in"
322,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and other communities which he"
323,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,had observed at first hand; and he employed a correspondingly accurate
324,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,and as it were topographical imagination when he wrote of affairs in
325,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Kansas, Paris, or Italy."
326,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
327,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Men were never abstractions to him. They were concrete persons, with"
328,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"ambitions to be tempted, generosities to be wakened, weaknesses to be"
329,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"utilized. His own county of Essex was then, as now, noted for the"
330,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"adroitness of its politicians, but at twenty-five John Greenleaf"
331,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Whittier could beat the best of them at their own game. He was tireless
332,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"in personal persuasion, in secret correspondence, in fighting fire with"
333,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"fire. He read Burke, and was prompt to apply Burke’s principle: “When"
334,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"bad men combine, the good should associate.” A Whig himself until the"
335,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"formation of the Liberty party, he was willing, as his friend Garrison"
336,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"was not, to compromise on non-essentials for the sake of bringing things"
337,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,to pass. The hand of a master is revealed in his published letters to
338,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Caleb Cushing and to Henry Clay. It was he who devised the coalitions
339,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"which sent Cushing, the Whig, and Rantoul, the Democrat, to Congress,"
340,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,which made Boutwell governor of Massachusetts and sent Sumner to the
341,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,United States Senate. When Sumner was struck down in the Senate chamber
342,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"and his indignant constituents held mass meetings to voice their horror,"
343,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Whittier was self-controlled enough to declare: “It seems to me to be no
344,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,time for the indulgence of mere emotions.... The North is not united for
345,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"freedom as the South is for slavery.... We must forget, _forgive_, and"
346,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,UNITE.” No utterance could be more characteristic of the man. In public
347,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"affairs he knew what he wanted to compass, and he was as willing to"
348,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"lobby or to trade votes as to write an editorial or a lyric, provided"
349,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,the good cause could be thereby made to prosper. Extremists thought that
350,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,he yielded to considerations of mere expediency; but his was rather the
351,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"versatility of the born political fighter, who can use more weapons than"
352,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"one. Underneath all questions of policy, lay his inherited democratic"
353,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,sympathy with the ordinary man. At the height of his fame he loved to
354,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"sit upon a cracker barrel in the grocery store at Amesbury, and talk"
355,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"politics. “I am a _man_,” he wrote to his biographer Underwood in 1883,"
356,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,“and not a mere verse-maker.”
357,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
358,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,This glimpse at the later revelations of his character is essential to
359,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"an understanding of the spiritual crisis which confronted him in 1833,"
360,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"when he was only twenty-six. He loved power, and had already exercised"
361,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,it in the congenial field of politics. The road to preferment lay that
362,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"way. It is true that he had continued to compose abundantly, both in"
363,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,prose and in verse. His writings were favorably noticed. Yet he saw no
364,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,career for himself as a man of letters. “I have done with poetry and
365,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"literature,” he wrote to a friend in 1832. Repeated disappointments in"
366,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,love had darkened his spirit. The death of his father had forced him
367,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,back to the old farm to support his mother and sisters. Black care sat
368,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"very close behind him. Discouraged, lonely, with ambitions ungratified"
369,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"and great powers of which he was but half aware, he paused, like some"
370,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,knight who had lost his way in an enchanted forest. Then blew the
371,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,clear unmistakable trumpet call which broke the spell and summoned him
372,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"to action. Although an anti-slavery man by native instinct, Whittier"
373,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,had never given his adherence to the sect of Abolitionists. Now came a
374,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"letter from Garrison (March 22, 1833): “My brother, there are upwards"
375,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,of two million of our countrymen who are doomed to the most horrible
376,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,servitude which ever cursed our race and blackened the page of
377,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,history. There are one hundred thousand of their offspring kidnapped
378,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,annually from their birth. The southern portion of our country is
379,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"going down to destruction, physically and morally, with a swift"
380,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"descent, carrying other portions with her. This, then, is a time for"
381,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the philanthropist—any friend of his country, to put forth his"
382,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"energies, in order to let the oppressed go free, and sustain the"
383,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"republic. The cause is worthy of Gabriel—yea, the God of hosts places"
384,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"himself at its head. Whittier, enlist! Your talents, zeal,"
385,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,influence—all are needed.”[1]
386,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
387,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"The spirit of Burns, years before, had whispered to the boy that he,"
388,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"too, had the poet-soul, yet facile versifying was all that had seemed to"
389,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"come of it, and the young man had turned to politics. Now the living"
390,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,voice of Garrison called him away from partisan ambitions to enlist in a
391,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"doubtful and perilous measure of moral reform. He obeyed, and—so strange"
392,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,are the mysteries of personality—found in that new service to humanity
393,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"not only the inspiration which made him a genuine poet, but the popular"
394,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,recognition which set the seal upon his fame.
395,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
396,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,The immediate cost of obedience to his conscience was heavy. The
397,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,generation of Americans born since the Civil War look back upon the
398,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Abolitionists as victors after thirty years of agitation, as the"
399,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,dictators of national policy. Their statues are in public places. Their
400,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,theories have prevailed. But in the early thirties they suffered such
401,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,ostracism and even martyrdom as only a few historical students now
402,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"realize. Churches, colleges, and courts were against them, for reasons"
403,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,which were adequate enough. They were dangerous members of society.
404,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,To-day we endeavor to exclude Anarchists from American soil; the leading
405,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Abolitionists, like the Russian Revolutionists of the present hour,"
406,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"preached Anarchy in the name of Humanity. Whittier, trained to quietism,"
407,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"non-resistance, and respect for law, and skilled as he had become in"
408,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"feeling the pulse of public opinion, knew perfectly well what company he"
409,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,was henceforth to keep. To be an active Abolitionist was to join the
410,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,outcasts.
411,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
412,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,His first act of allegiance was to write and publish at his own expense
413,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"a pamphlet entitled “Justice and Expediency,” which pleaded for"
414,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"immediate emancipation by peaceful means. In December, 1833, he was a"
415,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,delegate from Massachusetts at the founding in Philadelphia of the
416,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,American Anti-Slavery Society. Whittier was the youngest member. Thirty
417,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"years later he wrote to Garrison, who had been his companion upon that"
418,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"memorable journey: “I am not insensible to literary reputation. I love,"
419,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"perhaps too well, the praise and good-will of my fellow-men; but I set a"
420,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,higher value on my name as appended to the Anti-Slavery Declaration of
421,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,1833 than on the title-page of any book.” No words could better
422,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,illustrate his devotion to the cause of the slave. Yet he did not
423,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,surrender his right of private judgment as to the best means to be
424,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"employed. Garrison lost patience, ere long, with Whittier’s willingness"
425,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"to further the cause by compromise and concession, and the friends"
426,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"parted, to come together again in later years. The movement for"
427,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,emancipation needed both men and both methods; but Whittier’s
428,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"method—less heroic than Garrison’s, less intolerant than Sumner’s, less"
429,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,virulent than that of Wendell Phillips—was like Abraham Lincoln’s in its
430,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"patience, shrewdness, and sympathy."
431,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
432,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Whittier faced hostile mobs with perfect courage, and with a touch of"
433,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,the humor which is rarely revealed in his writings. When the
434,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Philadelphia rioters looted and burned Pennsylvania Hall, he disguised"
435,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"himself in a wig and long white overcoat, mingled with the mob, and"
436,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"saved his own editorial papers. He brought not only courage and finesse,"
437,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"but high journalistic skill, to the service of the Abolitionists. His"
438,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"pamphlets, his editorials in the “Freeman,” “Middlesex Standard,”"
439,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"“National Era,” and other newspapers, were trenchant, caustic, and"
440,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,far-sighted. Invalidism and the care of his mother’s family kept him
441,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"almost constantly at Amesbury, whither he had removed after the sale of"
442,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"his birthplace in 1836. But Whittier’s was no home-keeping mind, and"
443,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"there is scarcely a political event of importance, either in this"
444,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"country or abroad, which is not reflected in his prose and verse"
445,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,produced during the thirty years ending with the close of the Civil War.
446,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
447,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Yet his chief function during the long anti-slavery struggle was that of
448,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,chartered poet to the cause. No sooner had he abandoned his dream of
449,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"personal advancement than the Byronic melancholy, the weak imitations of"
450,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Scott, and the echoes of Mrs. Felicia Hemans disappear from his verse."
451,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"He was studying the prose of Milton and Burke, those organ-voices of"
452,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,English liberty. From Burns and Byron he now caught only the passion for
453,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"justice and the common rights of all. He forgot himself. He forgot, for"
454,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the time being, those pleasant themes of New England legend and history,"
455,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,which earlier and later touched his meditative fancy. The cause of negro
456,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,emancipation in America—to his mind only one phase of the struggle for a
457,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,wider human freedom everywhere—stirred and deepened his whole nature.
458,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,There is scarcely a type of political and social verse which is not
459,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,represented in his work during this period. He wrote personal lyrics in
460,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"praise of living leaders, and mournful salutes to the dead; hymns to be"
461,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"sung in churches, and campaign songs for the town hall. The touching"
462,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,lines to “Randolph of Roanoke” are a knightly tribute to an opponent.
463,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,The generous and noble “Lost Occasion” was written after Webster’s death
464,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"to supplement, rather than to retract, the terrific “Ichabod” addressed"
465,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,to Webster after his defence of the Fugitive Slave Law. Not since Burns
466,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,had any poet dared pillory the clergy in such derisive and indignant
467,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"strains as marked “Clerical Oppressors,” “The Pastoral Letter,” and “A"
468,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Sabbath Scene.” The selfishness of commercialism, and its “paltry pedler"
469,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"cries” which exalt “banks” and “tariffs” above the man, have never been"
470,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,arraigned more powerfully than in “The Pine-Tree” and “Moloch in State
471,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Street.” Such poems are class and party verse of the purest type.
472,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
473,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Whittier’s direct contact with the soil and his intense interest in
474,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,localities made him also an unequalled interpreter of sectional feeling.
475,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,“Massachusetts to Virginia” is perhaps the finest example of this sort
476,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"of political verse, but he wrote many similar poems hardly less"
477,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,striking; and such was the flexibility of Whittier’s imagination when
478,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,inspired by the common cause that he expressed not only the mood of the
479,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"New England but also of the Middle States, and of that “Wild West,” as"
480,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"he called it, which was so soon to combine with his “roused North.” Much"
481,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"of this political poetry was, in the nature of the case, only a sort of"
482,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"rhymed oratory, scarcely differing, save in rhetorical and metrical"
483,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"structure, from the speeches of Beecher and Wendell Phillips. Sometimes"
484,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"it was rhymed journalism, of the kind which Greeley was using in his"
485,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"sturdy iterative editorials. Much of it, no doubt, has already met the"
486,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,oblivion which attends most pamphlets or stanzas “for the times.”
487,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Harshness of tone, over-severity in judgment of men and measures,"
488,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"diffuseness of style, a faulty ear for rhymes, are frequently in"
489,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,evidence. Yet these blemishes scarcely affected the immediate value of
490,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Whittier’s verse for controversial purposes. Its faults of taste and
491,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"form were rightly forgotten in its communicative energy of emotion, its"
492,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"lambent scorn of evil things, its prophet-like exaltation. Long before"
493,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"armed conflict ended the debate, Whittier’s poetry had won the attention"
494,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"not only of his section, but of the entire North, and as the conflict"
495,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,proceeded his verse sounded more and more clearly that national note
496,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,which had been the burden of the great and maligned Webster’s speeches
497,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,for union. Only now it was to be a union redeemed. We must be “first
498,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"pure, then peaceable,” the Quaker poet had maintained, and the fine"
499,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"close of his ballad “Barbara Frietchie,” like his “Laus Deo” which “sang"
500,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,itself” in church while the bells were ringing to celebrate the passing
501,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"of slavery, is echoed to-day in the hearts of true Americans everywhere."
502,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
503,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,To study the chronological order of his poems from “The Exile’s
504,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Departure,” written in 1825, to “Snow-Bound,” written just forty years"
505,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"later, is to watch the steady broadening and clarifying of Whittier’s"
506,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,spirit. He found in the community of emotion wrought by a moral and
507,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,political crisis the secret of command over his own nature and over the
508,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,modes of poetic expression. By 1840 the worst hour of persecution for
509,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,the Abolitionists was already past. There were no more mobs for Whittier
510,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"to face. He remained, for the most part, quietly at Amesbury. In 1845 he"
511,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,began to contribute the spirited “Songs of Labor” to the “Democratic
512,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Review,” thus antedating Whitman by ten years in celebrating the"
513,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"American workingman. By 1847, in the “Proem” written to introduce the"
514,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"first general collection of his poems, he has already learned to regard"
515,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,himself as a singer whose nature inclined him to the “old melodious
516,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"lays” of Spenser and Sidney, although his lot had fallen in stormy"
517,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,times:—
518,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
519,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"“The rigor of a frozen clime,"
520,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"The harshness of an untaught ear,"
521,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,The jarring words of one whose rhyme
522,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Beat often Labor’s hurried time,"
523,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Or Duty’s rugged march through storm and strife, are here.”"
524,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
525,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"He does not regret his choice, but there is some yearning over the lost"
526,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Arcady. In the enforced leisure of his frequent invalidism Whittier read
527,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"very widely, and legend and dreamy fancy alternate in his verse with"
528,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,satirical invective and eloquent humanitarianism. The tragic “Ichabod”
529,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,and the mordant irony of “A Sabbath Scene” are followed by the charming
530,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"lines “To My Old Schoolmaster.” The poem on Burns, so fresh with “the"
531,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"dews of boyhood’s morning,” and the ballad of “Maud Muller,” where the"
532,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,pathos of our human “might have been” is expressed with such artless
533,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"adequacy, date from the thrilling year of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill. The"
534,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Kansas emigrants were actually singing
535,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
536,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,“We cross the prairie as of old
537,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,The Pilgrims crossed the sea”
538,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
539,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,while Whittier was writing “The Barefoot Boy” in 1855. The “Burial of
540,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Barber” is succeeded by “Mary Garvin.” After the storm, come the bird"
541,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,voices.
542,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
543,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"When “The Atlantic Monthly” was founded in 1857, Whittier contributed to"
544,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"its early numbers, not his timely and impassioned “Moloch in State"
545,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Street” and “Le Marais du Cygne,” but rather “The Gift of Tritemius,”"
546,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"“Skipper Ireson’s Ride,” and “Telling the Bees.” In other words, it was"
547,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,as a man of letters and not as a controversialist that he joined this
548,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,distinguished company of fellow contributors. Whittier was just turning
549,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"fifty, in that year. The hair was thin above his noticeably high"
550,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,forehead; his face and figure spare as in youth; his deep-set dark eyes
551,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"still aglow; the lips clean-shaven, nervous, resolute. Like another"
552,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"invalid, he was destined to long life, but of the thirty-five years then"
553,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"remaining to him, the succeeding ten were the most fruitful. Aside from"
554,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"those poems, already mentioned, inspired by the course and outcome of"
555,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the War for the Union, his most characteristic productions during this"
556,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"decade are suggested by such titles as “My Psalm,” “My Playmate,” “The"
557,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"River Path,” “Cobbler Keezar’s Vision,” “Mountain Pictures,” “Andrew"
558,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Rykman’s Prayer,” and “The Eternal Goodness.” These are grave, sweet,"
559,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"quiet poems, devout and consolatory."
560,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
561,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Whittier’s mother died in 1857, and his favorite sister, the gifted"
562,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Elizabeth, in 1864, thus leaving the Amesbury house desolate. The poet’s"
563,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"memories of his birthplace, only six miles away, but now in other hands,"
564,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"grew increasingly tender in his new loneliness, and he set himself to"
565,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"sketch, in an idyl longer than it was his wont to write, the scenes and"
566,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,persons dearest to his boyhood. “A homely picture of old New England
567,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"homes,” he called it in a note to Fields, his friendly publisher. The"
568,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"poem was “Snow-Bound,” and it proved at once to be what it has since"
569,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"remained, the most popular of his productions; notable, not so much for"
570,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"sensuous beauty or for any fresh range of thought, as for its vividness,"
571,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"its fidelity of homely detail, its unerring feeling for the sentiment of"
572,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,the hearthside.
573,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
574,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"The surprising profits of “Snow-Bound” made Whittier—to whom, as he"
575,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"himself said, the doors of magazines and publishing houses had been shut"
576,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,for twenty years of his life—a well-to-do man henceforward. He never
577,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"married. But he prided himself upon never losing a friend, and many"
578,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,homes were graciously offered to him in his old age. After the marriage
579,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"of his niece in 1876, he became for a large part of each year the guest"
580,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"of his cousins at Oak Knoll, Danvers. In this stately and beautiful"
581,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"home, and in many friendly houses in Boston, he met frequently some of"
582,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,the best men and women of his time. His relations with the chief
583,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"American authors of his day were cordial, although scarcely intimate."
584,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Most of them gathered in honor of his seventieth birthday at a dinner
585,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"given by the publishers of “The Atlantic,” and the subsequent"
586,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,anniversaries of his birth were very generally noticed. But his life was
587,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,essentially a solitary one. Professor Carpenter has noted in his
588,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,admirable study of Whittier that his most familiar acquaintances and
589,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"correspondents, in his later life, were women. “In old age his was the"
590,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"point of view, the theory of life, of the woman of gentle tastes,"
591,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"literary interests, and religious feeling. The best accounts of his"
592,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"later life are those of Mrs. Claflin and Mrs. Fields, in whose houses he"
593,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,was often a guest; and they have much to say of his sincere friendliness
594,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"and quiet talk, his shy avoidance of notoriety or even of a large group"
595,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"of people, his keen sense of humor, his tales of his youth, his quaintly"
596,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"serious comments on life, his sudden comings and goings as inclination"
597,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"moved, and of the rare occasions when, deeply moved, he spoke of the"
598,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,great issues of religion with beautiful earnestness and simple faith.
599,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"And it is pleasant to think of this farmer’s lad, who had lived for"
600,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"forty years in all but poverty for the love of God and his fellows,"
601,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,taking an innocent delight in the luxury of great houses and in the
602,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,sheltered life of those protected from hardship and privation. After his
603,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,long warfare this was a just reward.”[2]
604,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
605,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"After the publication of “Snow-Bound” in 1866, Whittier composed nearly"
606,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"two hundred poems. They celebrate some of his friendships, and indicate"
607,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,the variety of his reading and his interest in progress both in this
608,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"country and in Europe. They describe, with loving accuracy, the"
609,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"mountains, streams, and shore of New Hampshire, where he usually made"
610,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"his summer pilgrimages. But few of these later poems, pleasant reading"
611,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"as they are, affect materially one’s estimate of Whittier’s poetic"
612,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"powers. His real work was done. Here and there, and notably in the idyl"
613,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"“The Pennsylvania Pilgrim,” there is a grace and ripeness which indicate"
614,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"the Indian Summer of his art, with lovely lines written for the “wise"
615,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,angels” rather than for discordant men. One thinks with a sigh of his
616,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,description of himself in “The Tent on the Beach”:—
617,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
618,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"“And one there was, a dreamer born,"
619,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"Who, with a mission to fulfil,"
620,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,Had left the Muses’ haunts to turn
621,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,The crank of an opinion-mill.”
622,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
623,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,But regrets that he could not have lingered in dream-land are doubly
624,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"futile; for it was the opinion-mill, after all, that made Whittier a"
625,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,poet. Life taught him deeper secrets than bookish ease could ever have
626,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"imparted. “The simple fact is,” he wrote to E. L. Godkin, “that I cannot"
627,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,be sufficiently grateful to the Divine Providence that so early called
628,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"my attention to the great interests of humanity, saving me from the poor"
629,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,ambitions and miserable jealousies of a selfish pursuit of literary
630,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"reputation.” These words might have been written by one of the saints,"
631,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"and such, in very truth, was Whittier. Poverty, chastity, and obedience"
632,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,were his portion in this life. By the road of renunciation he entered
633,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,into his spiritual kingdom.
634,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,
635,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"He was not one of the royally endowed, far-shining, “myriad-minded”"
636,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"poets. He was rustic, provincial; a man of his place and time in"
637,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,America. It is doubtful if European readers will ever find him richly
638,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"suggestive, as they have found Emerson, Poe, and Whitman. But he had a"
639,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"tenacious hold upon certain realities: first, upon the soil of New"
640,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"England, of whose history and legend he became such a sympathetic"
641,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"interpreter; next, upon “the good old cause” of freedom, not only in his"
642,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,own country but in all places where the age-long and still but half-won
643,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"battle was being waged; and finally, upon some permanent objects of"
644,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"human emotion,—the hill-top, shore and sky, the fireside, the troubled"
645,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,heart that seeks rest in God. Whittier’s poetry has revealed to
646,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"countless readers the patient continuity of human life, its fundamental"
647,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"unity, and the ultimate peace that hushes its discords. The utter"
648,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,simplicity of his Quaker’s creed has helped him to interpret the
649,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,religious mood of a generation which has grown impatient of formal
650,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"doctrine. His hymns are sung by almost every body of Christians, the"
651,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,world over. It is unlikely that the plain old man who passed quietly
652,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"away in a New Hampshire village on September 7, 1892, aged eighty-five,"
653,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"will ever be reckoned one of the world-poets. But he was, in the best"
654,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"sense of the word, a world’s-man in heart and in action, a sincere and"
655,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,noble soul who hated whatever was evil and helped to make the good
656,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,"prevail; and his verse, fiery and tender and unfeigned, will long be"
657,JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,cherished by his countrymen.

804,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,
805,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,"It touched the tangled golden curls,"

809,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,
810,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,For near her stood the little boy
811,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,Her childish favor singled:
812,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,His cap pulled low upon a face
813,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,Where pride and shame were mingled.

815,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,Pushing with restless feet the snow
816,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,"To right and left, he lingered;—"

818,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,The blue-checked apron fingered.
819,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,
820,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,He saw her lift her eyes; he felt
821,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,"The soft hand’s light caressing,"
822,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,"And heard the tremble of her voice,"
823,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,As if a fault confessing.
824,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,
825,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,“I’m sorry that I spelt the word:
826,IN SCHOOL-DAYS,"I hate to go above you,"

1606,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Islam’s prophet on Al-Borák,—"
1607,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],The strangest ride that ever was sped
1608,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Was Ireson’s, out from Marblehead!"
1609,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,"
1610,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
1611,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],By the women of Marblehead!
1612,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],
1613,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Body of turkey, head of owl,"
1614,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Wings a-droop like a rained-on fowl,"
1615,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Feathered and ruffled in every part,"
1616,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Skipper Ireson stood in the cart.
1617,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Scores of women, old and young,"
1618,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Strong of muscle, and glib of tongue,"
1619,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Pushed and pulled up the rocky lane,"
1620,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Shouting and singing the shrill refrain:
1621,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"“Here’s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,"
1622,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt

1624,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],

1630,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Loose of kerchief and loose of hair,"
1631,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"With conch-shells blowing and fish-horns’ twang,"
1632,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Over and over the Mænads sang:

1637,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Small pity for him!—He sailed away
1638,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"From a leaking ship in Chaleur Bay,—"
1639,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Sailed away from a sinking wreck,"
1640,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],With his own town’s-people on her deck!
1641,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],“Lay by! lay by!” they called to him.
1642,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Back he answered, “Sink or swim!"
1643,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Brag of your catch of fish again!”
1644,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],And off he sailed through the fog and rain!
1645,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,"
1646,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart

1648,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],
1649,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Fathoms deep in dark Chaleur
1650,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],That wreck shall lie forevermore.
1651,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Mother and sister, wife and maid,"
1652,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Looked from the rocks of Marblehead
1653,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Over the moaning and rainy sea,—"
1654,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Looked for the coming that might not be!
1655,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],What did the winds and the sea-birds say
1656,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Of the cruel captain who sailed away?—
1657,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,"
1658,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
1659,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],By the women of Marblehead!
1660,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],
1661,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Through the street, on either side,"
1662,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Up flew windows, doors swung wide;"
1663,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Sharp-tongued spinsters, old wives gray,"
1664,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Treble lent the fish-horn’s bray.
1665,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Sea-worn grandsires, cripple-bound,"
1666,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Hulks of old sailors run aground,"
1667,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Shook head, and fist, and hat, and cane,"
1668,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],And cracked with curses the hoarse refrain:

1670,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt

1672,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],
1673,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Sweetly along the Salem road
1674,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Bloom of orchard and lilac showed.
1675,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Little the wicked skipper knew
1676,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Of the fields so green and the sky so blue.
1677,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Riding there in his sorry trim,"
1678,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Like an Indian idol glum and grim,"
1679,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Scarcely he seemed the sound to hear
1680,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Of voices shouting, far and near:"
1681,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"“Here’s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,"

1684,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],
1685,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"“Hear me, neighbors!” at last he cried,—"
1686,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],“What to me is this noisy ride?
1687,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],What is the shame that clothes the skin
1688,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],To the nameless horror that lives within?
1689,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Waking or sleeping, I see a wreck,"
1690,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],And hear a cry from a reeling deck!
1691,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Hate me and curse me,—I only dread"
1692,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],The hand of God and the face of the dead!”
1693,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Said old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,"
1694,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
1695,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],By the women of Marblehead!
1696,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],
1697,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Then the wife of the skipper lost at sea
1698,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Said, “God has touched him! why should we!”"
1699,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Said an old wife mourning her only son,"
1700,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],“Cut the rogue’s tether and let him run!”
1701,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"So with soft relentings and rude excuse,"
1702,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Half scorn, half pity, they cut him loose,"
1703,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"And gave him a cloak to hide him in,"
1704,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],And left him alone with his shame and sin.
1705,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],"Poor Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,"
1706,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
1707,SKIPPER IRESON’S RIDE[7],By the women of Marblehead!

1710,MAUD MULLER[8],MAUD MULLER[8]
1711,MAUD MULLER[8],
1712,MAUD MULLER[8],Maud Muller on a summer’s day
1713,MAUD MULLER[8],Raked the meadow sweet with hay.
1714,MAUD MULLER[8],
1715,MAUD MULLER[8],Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth
1716,MAUD MULLER[8],Of simple beauty and rustic health.
1717,MAUD MULLER[8],
1718,MAUD MULLER[8],"Singing, she wrought, and her merry glee"
1719,MAUD MULLER[8],The mock-bird echoed from his tree.
1720,MAUD MULLER[8],
1721,MAUD MULLER[8],"But when she glanced to the far-off town,"
1722,MAUD MULLER[8],"White from its hill-slope looking down,"
1723,MAUD MULLER[8],
1724,MAUD MULLER[8],"The sweet song died, and a vague unrest"
1725,MAUD MULLER[8],"And a nameless longing filled her breast,—"
1726,MAUD MULLER[8],
1727,MAUD MULLER[8],"A wish that she hardly dared to own,"
1728,MAUD MULLER[8],For something better than she had known.
1729,MAUD MULLER[8],
1730,MAUD MULLER[8],"The Judge rode slowly down the lane,"
1731,MAUD MULLER[8],Smoothing his horse’s chestnut mane.
1732,MAUD MULLER[8],
1733,MAUD MULLER[8],He drew his bridle in the shade
1734,MAUD MULLER[8],"Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid,"
1735,MAUD MULLER[8],
1736,MAUD MULLER[8],And asked a draught from the spring that flowed
1737,MAUD MULLER[8],Through the meadow across the road.
1738,MAUD MULLER[8],
1739,MAUD MULLER[8],"She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up,"
1740,MAUD MULLER[8],"And filled for him her small tin cup,"
1741,MAUD MULLER[8],
1742,MAUD MULLER[8],"And blushed as she gave it, looking down"
1743,MAUD MULLER[8],"On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown."
1744,MAUD MULLER[8],
1745,MAUD MULLER[8],“Thanks!” said the Judge; “a sweeter draught
1746,MAUD MULLER[8],From a fairer hand was never quaffed.”
1747,MAUD MULLER[8],
1748,MAUD MULLER[8],"He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees,"
1749,MAUD MULLER[8],Of the singing birds and the humming bees;
1750,MAUD MULLER[8],
1751,MAUD MULLER[8],"Then talked of the haying, and wondered whether"
1752,MAUD MULLER[8],The cloud in the west would bring foul weather.
1753,MAUD MULLER[8],
1754,MAUD MULLER[8],"And Maud forgot her brier-torn gown,"
1755,MAUD MULLER[8],And her graceful ankles bare and brown;
1756,MAUD MULLER[8],
1757,MAUD MULLER[8],"And listened, while a pleased surprise"
1758,MAUD MULLER[8],Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes.
1759,MAUD MULLER[8],
1760,MAUD MULLER[8],"At last, like one who for delay"
1761,MAUD MULLER[8],"Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away."
1762,MAUD MULLER[8],
1763,MAUD MULLER[8],Maud Muller looked and sighed: “Ah me!
1764,MAUD MULLER[8],That I the Judge’s bride might be!
1765,MAUD MULLER[8],
1766,MAUD MULLER[8],"“He would dress me up in silks so fine,"
1767,MAUD MULLER[8],And praise and toast me at his wine.
1768,MAUD MULLER[8],
1769,MAUD MULLER[8],“My father should wear a broadcloth coat;
1770,MAUD MULLER[8],My brother should sail a painted boat.
1771,MAUD MULLER[8],
1772,MAUD MULLER[8],"“I’d dress my mother so grand and gay,"
1773,MAUD MULLER[8],And the baby should have a new toy each day.
1774,MAUD MULLER[8],
1775,MAUD MULLER[8],"“And I’d feed the hungry and clothe the poor,"
1776,MAUD MULLER[8],And all should bless me who left our door.”
1777,MAUD MULLER[8],
1778,MAUD MULLER[8],"The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill,"
1779,MAUD MULLER[8],And saw Maud Muller standing still.
1780,MAUD MULLER[8],
1781,MAUD MULLER[8],"“A form more fair, a face more sweet,"
1782,MAUD MULLER[8],Ne’er hath it been my lot to meet.
1783,MAUD MULLER[8],
1784,MAUD MULLER[8],“And her modest answer and graceful air
1785,MAUD MULLER[8],Show her wise and good as she is fair.
1786,MAUD MULLER[8],
1787,MAUD MULLER[8],"“Would she were mine, and I to-day,"
1788,MAUD MULLER[8],"Like her, a harvester of hay;"
1789,MAUD MULLER[8],
1790,MAUD MULLER[8],"“No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs,"
1791,MAUD MULLER[8],"Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues,"
1792,MAUD MULLER[8],
1793,MAUD MULLER[8],"“But low of cattle and song of birds,"
1794,MAUD MULLER[8],And health and quiet and loving words.”
1795,MAUD MULLER[8],
1796,MAUD MULLER[8],"But he thought of his sisters, proud and cold,"
1797,MAUD MULLER[8],"And his mother, vain of her rank and gold."
1798,MAUD MULLER[8],
1799,MAUD MULLER[8],"So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on,"
1800,MAUD MULLER[8],And Maud was left in the field alone.
1801,MAUD MULLER[8],
1802,MAUD MULLER[8],"But the lawyers smiled that afternoon,"
1803,MAUD MULLER[8],When he hummed in court an old love-tune;
1804,MAUD MULLER[8],
1805,MAUD MULLER[8],And the young girl mused beside the well
1806,MAUD MULLER[8],Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.
1807,MAUD MULLER[8],
1808,MAUD MULLER[8],"He wedded a wife of richest dower,"
1809,MAUD MULLER[8],"Who lived for fashion, as he for power."
1810,MAUD MULLER[8],
1811,MAUD MULLER[8],"Yet oft, in his marble hearth’s bright glow,"
1812,MAUD MULLER[8],He watched a picture come and go;
1813,MAUD MULLER[8],
1814,MAUD MULLER[8],And sweet Maud Muller’s hazel eyes
1815,MAUD MULLER[8],Looked out in their innocent surprise.
1816,MAUD MULLER[8],
1817,MAUD MULLER[8],"Oft, when the wine in his glass was red,"
1818,MAUD MULLER[8],He longed for the wayside well instead;
1819,MAUD MULLER[8],
1820,MAUD MULLER[8],And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms
1821,MAUD MULLER[8],To dream of meadows and clover-blooms.
1822,MAUD MULLER[8],
1823,MAUD MULLER[8],"And the proud man sighed, with a secret pain,"
1824,MAUD MULLER[8],"“Ah, that I were free again!"
1825,MAUD MULLER[8],
1826,MAUD MULLER[8],"“Free as when I rode that day,"
1827,MAUD MULLER[8],Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay.”
1828,MAUD MULLER[8],
1829,MAUD MULLER[8],"She wedded a man unlearned and poor,"
1830,MAUD MULLER[8],And many children played round her door.
1831,MAUD MULLER[8],
1832,MAUD MULLER[8],"But care and sorrow, and childbirth pain,"
1833,MAUD MULLER[8],Left their traces on heart and brain.
1834,MAUD MULLER[8],
1835,MAUD MULLER[8],"And oft, when the summer sun shone hot"
1836,MAUD MULLER[8],"On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot,"
1837,MAUD MULLER[8],
1838,MAUD MULLER[8],And she heard the little spring brook fall
1839,MAUD MULLER[8],"Over the roadside, through the wall,"
1840,MAUD MULLER[8],
1841,MAUD MULLER[8],In the shade of the apple-tree again
1842,MAUD MULLER[8],She saw a rider draw his rein;
1843,MAUD MULLER[8],
1844,MAUD MULLER[8],"And, gazing down with timid grace,"
1845,MAUD MULLER[8],She felt his pleased eyes read her face.
1846,MAUD MULLER[8],
1847,MAUD MULLER[8],Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls
1848,MAUD MULLER[8],Stretched away into stately halls;
1849,MAUD MULLER[8],
1850,MAUD MULLER[8],"The weary wheel to a spinnet turned,"
1851,MAUD MULLER[8],"The tallow candle an astral burned,"
1852,MAUD MULLER[8],
1853,MAUD MULLER[8],"And for him who sat by the chimney lug,"
1854,MAUD MULLER[8],"Dozing and grumbling o’er pipe and mug,"
1855,MAUD MULLER[8],
1856,MAUD MULLER[8],"A manly form at her side she saw,"
1857,MAUD MULLER[8],And joy was duty and love was law.
1858,MAUD MULLER[8],
1859,MAUD MULLER[8],"Then she took up her burden of life again,"
1860,MAUD MULLER[8],"Saying only, “It might have been.”"
1861,MAUD MULLER[8],
1862,MAUD MULLER[8],"Alas for maiden, alas for Judge,"
1863,MAUD MULLER[8],For rich repiner and household drudge!
1864,MAUD MULLER[8],
1865,MAUD MULLER[8],"God pity them both! and pity us all,"
1866,MAUD MULLER[8],Who vainly the dreams of youth recall.
1867,MAUD MULLER[8],
1868,MAUD MULLER[8],"For of all sad words of tongue or pen,"
1869,MAUD MULLER[8],The saddest are these: “It might have been!”
1870,MAUD MULLER[8],
1871,MAUD MULLER[8],"Ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies"
1872,MAUD MULLER[8],Deeply buried from human eyes;
1873,MAUD MULLER[8],
1874,MAUD MULLER[8],"And, in the hereafter, angels may"
1875,MAUD MULLER[8],Roll the stone from its grave away!
1876,MAUD MULLER[8],

1879,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],
1880,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],O Mother Earth! upon thy lap

1884,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],Fold softly in thy long embrace
1885,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"That heart so worn and broken,"
1886,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],And cool its pulse of fire beneath
1887,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],Thy shadows old and oaken.
1888,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],
1889,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],Shut out from him the bitter word

1892,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],Disturb his quiet morning.
1893,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],Breathe over him forgetfulness
1894,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"Of all save deeds of kindness,"

1896,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],Press down his lids in blindness.
1897,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],
1898,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"There, where with living ear and eye"
1899,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"He heard Potomac’s flowing,"
1900,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"And, through his tall ancestral trees,"
1901,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"Saw autumn’s sunset glowing,"
1902,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"He sleeps, still looking to the west,"
1903,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"Beneath the dark wood shadow,"
1904,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],As if he still would see the sun

1909,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"The tenderest wail of human woe,"
1910,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],The scorn like lightning blasting;
1911,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],The pathos which from rival eyes
1912,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"Unwilling tears could summon,"
1913,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"The stinging taunt, the fiery burst"
1914,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],Of hatred scarcely human!
1915,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],
1916,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"Mirth, sparkling like a diamond shower,"
1917,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],From lips of life-long sadness;
1918,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],Clear picturings of majestic thought
1919,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],Upon a ground of madness;
1920,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],And over all Romance and Song
1921,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"A classic beauty throwing,"
1922,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],And laurelled Clio at his side
1923,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],Her storied pages showing.
1924,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],
1925,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],All parties feared him: each in turn
1926,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"Beheld its schemes disjointed,"
1927,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],As right or left his fatal glance
1928,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],And spectral finger pointed.
1929,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"Sworn foe of Cant, he smote it down"
1930,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"With trenchant wit unsparing,"
1931,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],"And, mocking, rent with ruthless hand"
1932,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],The robe Pretence was wearing.

1934,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],Too honest or too proud to feign

1937,RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE[9],His patriotism perished.

2273,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2274,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Up from the meadows rich with corn,"
2275,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Clear in the cool September morn,"
2276,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2277,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],The clustered spires of Frederick stand
2278,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.
2279,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2280,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Round about them orchards sweep,"
2281,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Apple and peach tree fruited deep,"
2282,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2283,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Fair as the garden of the Lord
2284,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"To the eyes of the famished rebel horde,"
2285,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2286,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],On that pleasant morn of the early fall
2287,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],When Lee marched over the mountain-wall;
2288,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2289,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Over the mountains winding down,"
2290,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Horse and foot, into Frederick town."
2291,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2292,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Forty flags with their silver stars,"
2293,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Forty flags with their crimson bars,"
2294,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2295,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Flapped in the morning wind: the sun
2296,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Of noon looked down, and saw not one."
2297,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2298,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,"
2299,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;
2300,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2301,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Bravest of all in Frederick town,"
2302,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],She took up the flag the men hauled down;
2303,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2304,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"In her attic window the staff she set,"
2305,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],To show that one heart was loyal yet.
2306,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2307,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Up the street came the rebel tread,"
2308,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.
2309,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2310,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Under his slouched hat left and right
2311,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],He glanced; the old flag met his sight.
2312,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2313,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],“Halt!”—the dust-brown ranks stood fast.
2314,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],“Fire!”—out blazed the rifle-blast.
2315,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2316,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"It shivered the window, pane and sash:"
2317,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],It rent the banner with seam and gash.
2318,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2319,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff"
2320,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf.
2321,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2322,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"She leaned far out on the window-sill,"
2323,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],And shook it forth with a royal will.
2324,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2325,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"“Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,"
2326,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"But spare your country’s flag,” she said."
2327,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2328,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,"
2329,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Over the face of the leader came;
2330,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2331,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],The nobler nature within him stirred
2332,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],To life at that woman’s deed and word;
2333,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2334,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],“Who touches a hair of yon gray head
2335,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Dies like a dog! March on!” he said.
2336,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2337,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],All day long through Frederick street
2338,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Sounded the tread of marching feet:
2339,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2340,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],All day long that free flag tost
2341,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Over the heads of the rebel host.
2342,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2343,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Ever its torn folds rose and fell
2344,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],On the loyal winds that loved it well;
2345,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2346,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],And through the hill-gaps sunset light
2347,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Shone over it with a warm good-night.
2348,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2349,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Barbara Frietchie’s work is o’er,"
2350,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],And the Rebel rides on his raids no more.
2351,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2352,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Honor to her! and let a tear
2353,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall’s bier."
2354,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2355,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Over Barbara Frietchie’s grave,"
2356,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],"Flag of Freedom and Union, wave!"
2357,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2358,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Peace and order and beauty draw
2359,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],Round thy symbol of light and law;
2360,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],
2361,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],And ever the stars above look down
2362,BARBARA FRIETCHIE[14],On thy stars below in Frederick town!

2387,LAUS DEO![15],
2388,LAUS DEO![15],For the Lord
2389,LAUS DEO![15],On the whirlwind is abroad;

2391,LAUS DEO![15],He has smitten with His thunder
2392,LAUS DEO![15],"The iron walls asunder,"

2394,LAUS DEO![15],
2395,LAUS DEO![15],Loud and long
2396,LAUS DEO![15],Lift the old exulting song;
2397,LAUS DEO![15],"Sing with Miriam by the sea,"
2398,LAUS DEO![15],He has cast the mighty down;
2399,LAUS DEO![15],Horse and rider sink and drown;
2400,LAUS DEO![15],“He hath triumphed gloriously!”
2401,LAUS DEO![15],
2402,LAUS DEO![15],"Did we dare,"
2403,LAUS DEO![15],"In our agony of prayer,"
2404,LAUS DEO![15],Ask for more than He has done?
2405,LAUS DEO![15],When was ever His right hand
2406,LAUS DEO![15],Over any time or land
2407,LAUS DEO![15],Stretched as now beneath the sun?
2408,LAUS DEO![15],
2409,LAUS DEO![15],"How they pale,"
2410,LAUS DEO![15],"Ancient myth and song and tale,"
2411,LAUS DEO![15],"In this wonder of our days,"
2412,LAUS DEO![15],When the cruel rod of war
2413,LAUS DEO![15],"Blossoms white with righteous law,"
2414,LAUS DEO![15],And the wrath of man is praise!
2415,LAUS DEO![15],
2416,LAUS DEO![15],Blotted out!
2417,LAUS DEO![15],All within and all about
2418,LAUS DEO![15],Shall a fresher life begin;
2419,LAUS DEO![15],Freer breathe the universe
2420,LAUS DEO![15],As it rolls its heavy curse
2421,LAUS DEO![15],On the dead and buried sin!
2422,LAUS DEO![15],
2423,LAUS DEO![15],It is done!
2424,LAUS DEO![15],In the circuit of the sun
2425,LAUS DEO![15],Shall the sound thereof go forth.
2426,LAUS DEO![15],"It shall bid the sad rejoice,"
2427,LAUS DEO![15],"It shall give the dumb a voice,"
2428,LAUS DEO![15],
2429,LAUS DEO![15],It shall belt with joy the earth!
2430,LAUS DEO![15],"Ring and swing,"
2431,LAUS DEO![15],Bells of joy! On morning’s wing
2432,LAUS DEO![15],Send the song of praise abroad!
2433,LAUS DEO![15],With a sound of broken chains
2434,LAUS DEO![15],"Tell the nations that he reigns,"
2435,LAUS DEO![15],Who alone is Lord and God!

2617,MY PSALM,
2618,MY PSALM,That all the jarring notes of life
2619,MY PSALM,"Seem blending in a psalm,"

2621,MY PSALM,Slow rounding into calm.
2622,MY PSALM,
2623,MY PSALM,"And so the shadows fall apart,"
2624,MY PSALM,And so the west-winds play;
2625,MY PSALM,And all the windows of my heart
2626,MY PSALM,I open to the day.
2627,MY PSALM,
2628,MY PSALM,
2629,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS
2630,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2631,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,O friends! with whom my feet have trod
2632,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"The quiet aisles of prayer,"
2633,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Glad witness to your zeal for God
2634,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And love of man I bear.
2635,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2636,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I trace your lines of argument;
2637,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Your logic linked and strong
2638,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I weigh as one who dreads dissent,"
2639,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And fears a doubt as wrong.
2640,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2641,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,But still my human hands are weak
2642,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,To hold your iron creeds:
2643,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Against the words ye bid me speak
2644,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,My heart within me pleads.
2645,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2646,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Who fathoms the Eternal Thought?
2647,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Who talks of scheme and plan?
2648,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The Lord is God! He needeth not
2649,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The poor device of man.
2650,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2651,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I walk with bare, hushed feet the ground"
2652,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Ye tread with boldness shod;
2653,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I dare not fix with mete and bound
2654,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The love and power of God.
2655,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2656,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Ye praise His justice; even such
2657,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,His pitying love I deem:
2658,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Ye seek a king; I fain would touch
2659,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The robe that hath no seam.
2660,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2661,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Ye see the curse which overbroods
2662,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,A world of pain and loss;
2663,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I hear our Lord’s beatitudes
2664,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And prayer upon the cross.
2665,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2666,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"More than your schoolmen teach, within"
2667,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"Myself, alas! I know:"
2668,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"Too dark ye cannot paint the sin,"
2669,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Too small the merit show.
2670,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2671,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I bow my forehead to the dust,"
2672,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I veil mine eyes for shame,"
2673,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"And urge, in trembling self-distrust,"
2674,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,A prayer without a claim.
2675,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2676,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I see the wrong that round me lies,"
2677,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I feel the guilt within;
2678,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I hear, with groan and travail-cries,"
2679,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The world confess its sin.
2680,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2681,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"Yet, in the maddening maze of things,"
2682,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"And tossed by storm and flood,"
2683,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,To one fixed trust my spirit clings;
2684,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I know that God is good!
2685,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2686,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Not mine to look where cherubim
2687,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"And seraphs may not see,"
2688,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,But nothing can be good in Him
2689,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Which evil is in me.
2690,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2691,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The wrong that pains my soul below
2692,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I dare not throne above,"
2693,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I know not of His hate,—I know"
2694,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,His goodness and His love.
2695,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2696,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I dimly guess from blessings known
2697,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"Of greater out of sight,"
2698,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"And, with the chastened Psalmist, own"
2699,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,His judgments too are right.
2700,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2701,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I long for household voices gone,"
2702,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"For vanished smiles I long,"
2703,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"But God hath led my dear ones on,"
2704,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And He can do no wrong.
2705,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2706,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I know not what the future hath
2707,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"Of marvel or surprise,"
2708,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Assured alone that life and death
2709,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,His mercy underlies.
2710,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2711,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And if my heart and flesh are weak
2712,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"To bear an untried pain,"
2713,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"The bruised reed He will not break,"
2714,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,But strengthen and sustain.
2715,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2716,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"No offering of my own I have,"
2717,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Nor works my faith to prove;
2718,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I can but give the gifts He gave,"
2719,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And plead His love for love.
2720,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2721,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And so beside the Silent Sea
2722,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I wait the muffled oar;
2723,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,No harm from Him can come to me
2724,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,On ocean or on shore.
2725,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2726,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I know not where His islands lift
2727,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Their fronded palms in air;
2728,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I only know I cannot drift
2729,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Beyond His love and care.
2730,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2731,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"O brothers! if my faith is vain,"
2732,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"If hopes like these betray,"
2733,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Pray for me that my feet may gain
2734,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The sure and safer way.
2735,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
2736,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"And Thou, O Lord! by whom are seen"
2737,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"Thy creatures as they be,"
2738,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Forgive me if too close I lean
2739,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,My human heart on Thee!

2832,U · S · A,
2833,U · S · A,MY DEAR FRIEND; I heartily thank thee for a copy of thy _History of
2834,U · S · A,Marblehead_. I have read it with great interest and think good use has
2835,U · S · A,been made of the abundant material. No town in Essex County has a
2836,U · S · A,record more honorable than Marblehead; no one has done more to develop
2837,U · S · A,"the industrial interests of our New England seaboard, and certainly"
2838,U · S · A,none have given such evidence of self-sacrificing patriotism. I am
2839,U · S · A,"glad the story of it has been at last told, and told so well. I have"
2840,U · S · A,now no doubt that thy version of Skipper Ireson’s ride is the correct
2841,U · S · A,one. My verse was founded solely on a fragment of rhyme which I heard
2842,U · S · A,"from one of my early schoolmates, a native of Marblehead."
2843,U · S · A,
2844,U · S · A,I supposed the story to which it referred dated back at least a
2845,U · S · A,"century. I knew nothing of the participators, and the narrative of the"
2846,U · S · A,ballad was pure fancy. I am glad for the sake of truth and justice
2847,U · S · A,that the real facts are given in thy book. I certainly would not
2848,U · S · A,"knowingly do injustice to any one, dead or living."

2855,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,The recollection of some descendants of a Hessian deserter in the
2856,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,Revolutionary war bearing the name of Muller doubtless suggested the
2857,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,somewhat infelicitous title of a New England idyl. The poem had no real
2858,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,"foundation in fact, though a hint of it may have been found in recalling"
2859,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,"an incident, trivial in itself, of a journey on the picturesque Maine"
2860,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,seaboard with my sister some years before it was written. We had stopped
2861,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,"to rest our tired horse under the shade of an apple-tree, and refresh"
2862,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,him with water from a little brook which rippled through the stone wall
2863,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,across the road. A very beautiful young girl in scantest summer attire
2864,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,"was at work in the hay-field, and as we talked with her we noticed that"
2865,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,"she strove to hide her bare feet by raking hay over them, blushing as"

2872,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,"published in July, 1833, Whittier says: “In the last hour of his"
2873,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,"[Randolph’s] existence, when his soul was struggling from its broken"
2874,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,"tenement, his latest effort was the confirmation of this generous act of"

2884,JOHN G. WHITTIER.,"B. Grey, of Norfolk, claiming to be his master. The case caused great"

2902,1846.—WHITTIER.,"Daniel Webster in support of the “compromise,” and the Fugitive Slave"
2903,1846.—WHITTIER.,Law. No partisan or personal enmity dictated it. On the contrary my
2904,1846.—WHITTIER.,admiration of the splendid personality and intellectual power of the
2905,1846.—WHITTIER.,"great Senator was never stronger than when I laid down his speech, and,"
2906,1846.—WHITTIER.,"in one of the saddest moments of my life, penned my protest. I saw, as I"

2908,1846.—WHITTIER.,"and defiant, strengthened and encouraged to carry out its scheme for the"
2909,1846.—WHITTIER.,"extension of its baleful system, or the dissolution of the Union, the"
2910,1846.—WHITTIER.,"guaranties of personal liberty in the free States broken down, and the"

2929,1846.—WHITTIER.,This poem was written in strict conformity to the account of the
2930,1846.—WHITTIER.,incident as I had it from respectable and trustworthy sources. It has
2931,1846.—WHITTIER.,"since been the subject of a good deal of conflicting testimony, and the"
2932,1846.—WHITTIER.,story was probably incorrect in some of its details. It is admitted by
2933,1846.—WHITTIER.,"all that Barbara Frietchie was no myth, but a worthy and highly esteemed"
2934,1846.—WHITTIER.,"gentlewoman, intensely loyal and a hater of the Slavery Rebellion,"
2935,1846.—WHITTIER.,holding her Union flag sacred and keeping it with her Bible; that when
2936,1846.—WHITTIER.,"the Confederates halted before her house, and entered her dooryard, she"
2937,1846.—WHITTIER.,"denounced them in vigorous language, shook her cane in their faces, and"
2938,1846.—WHITTIER.,drove them out; and when General Burnside’s troops followed close upon
2939,1846.—WHITTIER.,"Jackson’s, she waved her flag and cheered them. It is stated that May"
2940,1846.—WHITTIER.,"Quantrell, a brave and loyal lady in another part of the city, did wave"
2941,1846.—WHITTIER.,her flag in sight of the Confederates. It is possible that there has
