80,TENNANT'S ANSTER FAIR.,
81,I.,I.
82,I.,
83,I.,'Tis the middle watch of a summer's night--
84,I.,"The earth is dark, but the heavens are bright;"
85,I.,Nought is seen in the vault on high
86,I.,"But the moon, and the stars, and the cloudless sky,"
87,I.,"And the flood which rolls its milky hue,"
88,I.,A river of light on the welkin blue.
89,I.,"The moon looks down on old Cronest,"
90,I.,"She mellows the shades on his shaggy breast,"
91,I.,And seems his huge gray form to throw
92,I.,In a sliver cone on the wave below;
93,I.,"His sides are broken by spots of shade,"
94,I.,"By the walnut bough and the cedar made,"
95,I.,And through their clustering branches dark
96,I.,Glimmers and dies the fire-fly's spark--
97,I.,Like starry twinkles that momently break
98,I.,Through the rifts of the gathering tempest's rack.
99,I.,
100,II.,II.
101,II.,
102,II.,"The stars are on the moving stream,"
103,II.,"And fling, as its ripples gently flow,"
104,II.,A burnished length of wavy beam
105,II.,"In an eel-like, spiral line below;"
106,II.,"The winds are whist, and the owl is still,"
107,II.,"The bat in the shelvy rock is hid,"
108,II.,And nought is heard on the lonely hill
109,II.,"But the cricket's chirp, and the answer shrill"
110,II.,Of the gauze-winged katy-did;
111,II.,"And the plaint of the wailing whip-poor-will,"
112,II.,"Who moans unseen, and ceaseless sings,"
113,II.,"Ever a note of wail and wo,"
114,II.,"Till morning spreads her rosy wings,"
115,II.,And earth and sky in her glances glow.
116,II.,
117,III.,III.
118,III.,
119,III.,'Tis the hour of fairy ban and spell:
120,III.,The wood-tick has kept the minutes well;
121,III.,"He has counted them all with click and stroke,"
122,III.,"Deep in the heart of the mountain oak,"
123,III.,And he has awakened the sentry elve
124,III.,"Who sleeps with him in the haunted tree,"
125,III.,"To bid him ring the hour of twelve,"
126,III.,And call the fays to their revelry;
127,III.,Twelve small strokes on his tinkling bell--
128,III.,('Twas made of the white snail's pearly shell:--)
129,III.,"""Midnight comes, and all is well!"
130,III.,"Hither, hither, wing your way!"
131,III.,"'Tis the dawn of the fairy day."""
132,III.,
133,IV.,IV.
134,IV.,
135,IV.,"They come from beds of lichen green,"
136,IV.,They creep from the mullen's velvet screen;
137,IV.,Some on the backs of beetles fly
138,IV.,"From the silver tops of moon-touched trees,"
139,IV.,"Where they swung in their cobweb hammocks high,"
140,IV.,And rock'd about in the evening breeze;
141,IV.,Some from the hum-bird's downy nest--
142,IV.,"They had driven him out by elfin power,"
143,IV.,"And pillowed on plumes of his rainbow breast,"
144,IV.,Had slumbered there till the charmed hour;
145,IV.,"Some had lain in the scoop of the rock,"
146,IV.,With glittering ising-stars inlaid;
147,IV.,"And some had opened the four-o'clock,"
148,IV.,And stole within its purple shade.
149,IV.,"And now they throng the moonlight glade,"
150,IV.,"Above--below--on every side,"
151,IV.,Their little minim forms arrayed
152,IV.,In the tricksy pomp of fairy pride!
153,IV.,
154,V.,V.
155,V.,
156,V.,"They come not now to print the lea,"
157,V.,"In freak and dance around the tree,"
158,V.,"Or at the mushroom board to sup,"
159,V.,And drink the dew from the buttercup;--
160,V.,"A scene of sorrow waits them now,"
161,V.,For an Ouphe has broken his vestal vow;
162,V.,"He has loved an earthly maid,"
163,V.,And left for her his woodland shade;
164,V.,"He has lain upon her lip of dew,"
165,V.,"And sunned him in her eye of blue,"
166,V.,"Fann'd her cheek with his wing of air,"
167,V.,"Played in the ringlets of her hair,"
168,V.,"And, nestling on her snowy breast,"
169,V.,Forgot the lily-king's behest.
170,V.,For this the shadowy tribes of air
171,V.,To the elfin court must haste away:--
172,V.,"And now they stand expectant there,"
173,V.,To hear the doom of the Culprit Fay.
174,V.,
175,VI.,VI.
176,VI.,
177,VI.,The throne was reared upon the grass
178,VI.,Of spice-wood and of sassafras;
179,VI.,On pillars of mottled tortoise-shell
180,VI.,Hung the burnished canopy--
181,VI.,And o'er it gorgeous curtains fell
182,VI.,Of the tulip's crimson drapery.
183,VI.,"The monarch sat on his judgment-seat,"
184,VI.,"On his brow the crown imperial shone,"
185,VI.,"The prisoner Fay was at his feet,"
186,VI.,And his peers were ranged around the throne.
187,VI.,"He waved his sceptre in the air,"
188,VI.,He looked around and calmly spoke;
189,VI.,"His brow was grave and his eye severe,"
190,VI.,But his voice in a softened accent broke:
191,VI.,
192,VII.,VII.
193,VII.,
194,VII.,"""Fairy! Fairy! list and mark,"
195,VII.,"Thou hast broke thine elfin chain,"
196,VII.,"Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark,"
197,VII.,And thy wings are dyed with a deadly stain--
198,VII.,Thou hast sullied thine elfin purity
199,VII.,"In the glance of a mortal maiden's eye,"
200,VII.,"Thou hast scorned our dread decree,"
201,VII.,"And thou shouldst pay the forfeit high,"
202,VII.,But well I know her sinless mind
203,VII.,"Is pure as the angel forms above,"
204,VII.,"Gentle and meek, and chaste and kind,"
205,VII.,Such as a spirit well might love;
206,VII.,"Fairy! had she spot or taint,"
207,VII.,Bitter had been thy punishment.
208,VII.,Tied to the hornet's shardy wings;
209,VII.,Tossed on the pricks of nettles' stings;
210,VII.,Or seven long ages doomed to dwell
211,VII.,With the lazy worm in the walnut-shell;
212,VII.,Or every night to writhe and bleed
213,VII.,Beneath the tread of the centipede;
214,VII.,"Or bound in a cobweb dungeon dim,"
215,VII.,"Your jailer a spider huge and grim,"
216,VII.,"Amid the carrion bodies to lie,"
217,VII.,"Of the worm, and the bug, and the murdered fly:"
218,VII.,"These it had been your lot to bear,"
219,VII.,Had a stain been found on the earthly fair.
220,VII.,"Now list, and mark our mild decree--"
221,VII.,"Fairy, this your doom must be:"
222,VII.,
223,VIII.,VIII.
224,VIII.,
225,VIII.,"""Thou shalt seek the beach of sand"
226,VIII.,"Where the water bounds the elfin land,"
227,VIII.,Thou shalt watch the oozy brine
228,VIII.,"Till the sturgeon leaps in the bright moonshine,"
229,VIII.,"Then dart the glistening arch below,"
230,VIII.,And catch a drop from his silver bow.
231,VIII.,The water-sprites will wield their arms
232,VIII.,"And dash around, with roar and rave,"
233,VIII.,"And vain are the woodland spirits' charms,"
234,VIII.,They are the imps that rule the wave.
235,VIII.,"Yet trust thee in thy single might,"
236,VIII.,"If thy heart be pure and thy spirit right,"
237,VIII.,Thou shalt win the warlock fight.
238,VIII.,
239,IX.,IX.
240,IX.,
241,IX.,"""If the spray-bead gem be won,"
242,IX.,"The stain of thy wing is washed away,"
243,IX.,But another errand must be done
244,IX.,Ere thy crime be lost for aye;
245,IX.,"Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark,"
246,IX.,Thou must re-illume its spark.
247,IX.,Mount thy steed and spur him high
248,IX.,To the heaven's blue canopy;
249,IX.,"And when thou seest a shooting star,"
250,IX.,"Follow it fast, and follow it far--"
251,IX.,The last faint spark of its burning train
252,IX.,Shall light the elfin lamp again.
253,IX.,"Thou hast heard our sentence, Fay;"
254,IX.,"Hence! to the water-side, away!"""
255,IX.,
256,X.,X.
257,X.,
258,X.,The goblin marked his monarch well;
259,X.,"He spake not, but he bowed him low,"
260,X.,"Then plucked a crimson colen-bell,"
261,X.,And turned him round in act to go.
262,X.,"The way is long, he cannot fly,"
263,X.,"His soiled wing has lost its power,"
264,X.,"And he winds adown the mountain high,"
265,X.,For many a sore and weary hour.
266,X.,"Through dreary beds of tangled fern,"
267,X.,"Through groves of nightshade dark and dern,"
268,X.,"Over the grass and through the brake,"
269,X.,Where toils the ant and sleeps the snake;
270,X.,Now o'er the violet's azure flush
271,X.,He skips along in lightsome mood;
272,X.,"And now he thrids the bramble bush,"
273,X.,Till its points are dyed in fairy blood.
274,X.,"He has leapt the bog, he has pierced the briar,"
275,X.,"He has swum the brook, and waded the mire,"
276,X.,"Till his spirits sank, and his limbs grew weak,"
277,X.,And the red waxed fainter in his cheek.
278,X.,"He had fallen to the ground outright,"
279,X.,"For rugged and dim was his onward track,"
280,X.,"But there came a spotted toad in sight,"
281,X.,And he laughed as he jumped upon her back;
282,X.,He bridled her mouth with a silk-weed twist;
283,X.,He lashed her sides with an osier thong;
284,X.,"And now through evening's dewy mist,"
285,X.,"With leap and spring they bound along,"
286,X.,"Till the mountain's magic verge is past,"
287,X.,And the beach of sand is reached at last.
288,X.,
289,XI.,XI.
290,XI.,
291,XI.,"Soft and pale is the moony beam,"
292,XI.,"Moveless still the glassy stream,"
293,XI.,"The wave is clear, the beach is bright"
294,XI.,With snowy shells and sparkling stones;
295,XI.,"The shore-surge comes in ripples light,"
296,XI.,In murmurings faint and distant moans;
297,XI.,And ever afar in the silence deep
298,XI.,"Is heard the splash of the sturgeon's leap,"
299,XI.,And the bend of his graceful bow is seen--
300,XI.,"A glittering arch of silver sheen,"
301,XI.,"Spanning the wave of burnished blue,"
302,XI.,And dripping with gems of the river dew.
303,XI.,
304,XII.,XII.
305,XII.,
306,XII.,"The elfin cast a glance around,"
307,XII.,"As he lighted down from his courser toad,"
308,XII.,"Then round his breast his wings he wound,"
309,XII.,And close to the river's brink he strode;
310,XII.,"He sprang on a rock, he breathed a prayer,"
311,XII.,"Above his head his arms he threw,"
312,XII.,"Then tossed a tiny curve in air,"
313,XII.,And headlong plunged in the waters blue.
314,XII.,
315,XIII.,XIII.
316,XIII.,
317,XIII.,"Up sprung the spirits of the waves,"
318,XIII.,"From sea-silk beds in their coral caves,"
319,XIII.,"With snail-plate armour snatched in haste,"
320,XIII.,They speed their way through the liquid waste;
321,XIII.,Some are rapidly borne along
322,XIII.,"On the mailed shrimp or the prickly prong,"
323,XIII.,"Some on the blood-red leeches glide,"
324,XIII.,"Some on the stony star-fish ride,"
325,XIII.,"Some on the back of the lancing squab,"
326,XIII.,Some on the sidelong soldier-crab;
327,XIII.,"And some on the jellied quarl, that flings"
328,XIII.,At once a thousand streamy stings--
329,XIII.,They cut the wave with the living oar
330,XIII.,"And hurry on to the moonlight shore,"
331,XIII.,To guard their realms and chase away
332,XIII.,The footsteps of the invading Fay.
333,XIII.,
334,XIV.,XIV.
335,XIV.,
336,XIV.,"Fearlessly he skims along,"
337,XIV.,"His hope is high, and his limbs are strong,"
338,XIV.,"He spreads his arms like the swallow's wing,"
339,XIV.,And throws his feet with a frog-like fling;
340,XIV.,"His locks of gold on the waters shine,"
341,XIV.,"At his breast the tiny foam-beads rise,"
342,XIV.,"His back gleams bright above the brine,"
343,XIV.,And the wake-line foam behind him lies.
344,XIV.,But the water-sprites are gathering near
345,XIV.,To check his course along the tide;
346,XIV.,Their warriors come in swift career
347,XIV.,And hem him round on every side;
348,XIV.,"On his thigh the leech has fixed his hold,"
349,XIV.,"The quarl's long arms are round him roll'd,"
350,XIV.,"The prickly prong has pierced his skin,"
351,XIV.,"And the squab has thrown his javelin,"
352,XIV.,"The gritty star has rubbed him raw,"
353,XIV.,And the crab has struck with his giant claw;
354,XIV.,"He howls with rage, and he shrieks with pain,"
355,XIV.,"He strikes around, but his blows are vain;"
356,XIV.,"Hopeless is the unequal fight,"
357,XIV.,Fairy! nought is left but flight.
358,XIV.,
359,XV.,XV.
360,XV.,
361,XV.,He turned him round and fled amain
362,XV.,With hurry and dash to the beach again;
363,XV.,"He twisted over from side to side,"
364,XV.,And laid his cheek to the cleaving tide.
365,XV.,"The strokes of his plunging arms are fleet,"
366,XV.,"And with all his might he flings his feet,"
367,XV.,"But the water-sprites are round him still,"
368,XV.,To cross his path and work him ill.
369,XV.,They bade the wave before him rise;
370,XV.,"They flung the sea-fire in his eyes,"
371,XV.,"And they stunned his ears with the scallop stroke,"
372,XV.,With the porpoise heave and the drum-fish croak.
373,XV.,Oh! but a weary wight was he
374,XV.,When he reached the foot of the dog-wood tree;
375,XV.,"--Gashed and wounded, and stiff and sore,"
376,XV.,He laid him down on the sandy shore;
377,XV.,"He blessed the force of the charmed line,"
378,XV.,"And he banned the water-goblin's spite,"
379,XV.,"For he saw around in the sweet moonshine,"
380,XV.,"Their little wee faces above the brine,"
381,XV.,Giggling and laughing with all their might
382,XV.,At the piteous hap of the Fairy wight.
383,XV.,
384,XVI.,XVI.
385,XVI.,
386,XVI.,Soon he gathered the balsam dew
387,XVI.,From the sorrel leaf and the henbane bud;
388,XVI.,"Over each wound the balm he drew,"
389,XVI.,And with cobweb lint he stanched the blood.
390,XVI.,"The mild west wind was soft and low,"
391,XVI.,"It cooled the heat of his burning brow,"
392,XVI.,"And he felt new life in his sinews shoot,"
393,XVI.,As he drank the juice of the cal'mus root;
394,XVI.,"And now he treads the fatal shore,"
395,XVI.,As fresh and vigorous as before.
396,XVI.,
397,XVII.,XVII.
398,XVII.,
399,XVII.,Wrapped in musing stands the sprite:
400,XVII.,"'Tis the middle wane of night,"
401,XVII.,"His task is hard, his way is far,"
402,XVII.,But he must do his errand right
403,XVII.,"Ere dawning mounts her beamy car,"
404,XVII.,And rolls her chariot wheels of light;
405,XVII.,"And vain are the spells of fairy-land,"
406,XVII.,He must work with a human hand.
407,XVII.,
408,XVIII.,XVIII.
409,XVIII.,
410,XVIII.,"He cast a saddened look around,"
411,XVIII.,"But he felt new joy his bosom swell,"
412,XVIII.,"When, glittering on the shadowed ground,"
413,XVIII.,He saw a purple muscle shell;
414,XVIII.,"Thither he ran, and he bent him low,"
415,XVIII.,"He heaved at the stern and he heaved at the bow,"
416,XVIII.,"And he pushed her over the yielding sand,"
417,XVIII.,Till he came to the verge of the haunted land.
418,XVIII.,She was as lovely a pleasure boat
419,XVIII.,"As ever fairy had paddled in,"
420,XVIII.,"For she glowed with purple paint without,"
421,XVIII.,And shone with silvery pearl within;
422,XVIII.,"A sculler's notch in the stern he made,"
423,XVIII.,An oar he shaped of the bootle blade;
424,XVIII.,"Then spung to his seat with a lightsome leap,"
425,XVIII.,And launched afar on the calm blue deep.
426,XVIII.,
427,XIX.,XIX.
428,XIX.,
429,XIX.,The imps of the river yell and rave;
430,XIX.,"They had no power above the wave,"
431,XIX.,"But they heaved the billow before the prow,"
432,XIX.,"And they dashed the surge against her side,"
433,XIX.,"And they struck her keel with jerk and blow,"
434,XIX.,Till the gunwale bent to the rocking tide.
435,XIX.,"She wimpled about in the pale moonbeam,"
436,XIX.,Like a feather that floats on a wind tossed-stream;
437,XIX.,And momently athwart her track
438,XIX.,"The quarl upreared his island back,"
439,XIX.,"And the fluttering scallop behind would float,"
440,XIX.,And patter the water about the boat;
441,XIX.,"But he bailed her out with his colen-bell,"
442,XIX.,"And he kept her trimmed with a wary tread,"
443,XIX.,While on every side like lightening fell
444,XIX.,The heavy strokes of his bootle-blade.
445,XIX.,
446,XX.,XX.
447,XX.,
448,XX.,"Onward still he held his way,"
449,XX.,"Till he came where the column of moonshine lay,"
450,XX.,And saw beneath the surface dim
451,XX.,The brown-backed sturgeon slowly swim:
452,XX.,Around him were the goblin train--
453,XX.,"But he sculled with all his might and main,"
454,XX.,"And followed wherever the sturgeon led,"
455,XX.,Till he saw him upward point his head;
456,XX.,"Then he dropped his paddle blade,"
457,XX.,And held his colen goblet up
458,XX.,To catch the drop in its crimson cup.
459,XX.,
460,XXI.,XXI.
461,XXI.,
462,XXI.,"With sweeping tail and quivering fin,"
463,XXI.,"Through the wave the sturgeon flew,"
464,XXI.,"And, like the heaven-shot javelin,"
465,XXI.,He sprung above the waters blue.
466,XXI.,"Instant as the star-fall light,"
467,XXI.,"He plunged him in the deep again,"
468,XXI.,But left an arch of silver bright
469,XXI.,The rainbow of the moony main.
470,XXI.,It was a strange and lovely sight
471,XXI.,To see the puny goblin there;
472,XXI.,"He seemed an angel form of light,"
473,XXI.,"With azure wing and sunny hair,"
474,XXI.,"Throned on a cloud of purple fair,"
475,XXI.,"Circled with blue and edged with white,"
476,XXI.,And sitting at the fall of even
477,XXI.,Beneath the bow of summer heaven.
478,XXI.,
479,XXII.,XXII.
480,XXII.,
481,XXII.,"A moment and its lustre fell,"
482,XXII.,"But ere it met the billow blue,"
483,XXII.,"He caught within his crimson bell,"
484,XXII.,A droplet of its sparkling dew--
485,XXII.,"Joy to thee, Fay! thy task is done,"
486,XXII.,"Thy wings are pure, for the gem is won--"
487,XXII.,"Cheerly ply thy dripping oar,"
488,XXII.,And haste away to the elfin shore.
489,XXII.,
490,XXIII.,XXIII.
491,XXIII.,
492,XXIII.,"He turns, and lo! on either side"
493,XXIII.,The ripples on his path divide;
494,XXIII.,And the track o'er which his boat must pass
495,XXIII.,Is smooth as a sheet of polished glass.
496,XXIII.,"Around, their limbs the sea-nymphs lave,"
497,XXIII.,"With snowy arms half swelling out,"
498,XXIII.,While on the glossed and gleamy wave
499,XXIII.,Their sea-green ringlets loosely float;
500,XXIII.,They swim around with smile and song;
501,XXIII.,"They press the bark with pearly hand,"
502,XXIII.,"And gently urge her course along,"
503,XXIII.,Toward the beach of speckled sand;
504,XXIII.,"And, as he lightly leapt to land,"
505,XXIII.,"They bade adieu with nod and bow,"
506,XXIII.,"Then gayly kissed each little hand,"
507,XXIII.,And dropped in the crystal deep below.
508,XXIII.,
509,XXIV.,XXIV.
510,XXIV.,
511,XXIV.,A moment staied the fairy there;
512,XXIV.,"He kissed the beach and breathed a prayer,"
513,XXIV.,"Then spread his wings of gilded blue,"
514,XXIV.,And on to the elfin court he flew;
515,XXIV.,"As ever ye saw a bubble rise,"
516,XXIV.,"And shine with a thousand changing dyes,"
517,XXIV.,"Till lessening far through ether driven,"
518,XXIV.,It mingles with the hues of heaven:
519,XXIV.,"As, at the glimpse of morning pale,"
520,XXIV.,"The lance-fly spreads his silken sail,"
521,XXIV.,"And gleams with blendings soft and bright,"
522,XXIV.,Till lost in the shades of fading night;
523,XXIV.,So rose from earth the lovely Fay--
524,XXIV.,"So vanished, far in heaven away!"

536,XXV.,
537,XXV.,He put his acorn helmet on;
538,XXV.,It was plumed of the silk of the thistle down:
539,XXV.,The corslet plate that guarded his breast
540,XXV.,Was once the wild bee's golden vest;
541,XXV.,"His cloak, of a thousand mingled dyes,"
542,XXV.,Was formed of the wings of butterflies;
543,XXV.,"His shield was the shell of a lady-bug queen,"
544,XXV.,Studs of gold on a ground of green;
545,XXV.,"And the quivering lance which he brandished bright,"
546,XXV.,Was the sting of a wasp he had slain in fight.
547,XXV.,Swift he bestrode his fire-fly steed;
548,XXV.,He bared his blade of the bent grass blue;
549,XXV.,"He drove his spurs of the cockle seed,"
550,XXV.,"And away like a glance of thought he flew,"
551,XXV.,To skim the heavens and follow far
552,XXV.,The fiery trail of the rocket-star.
553,XXV.,
554,XXVI.,XXVI.
555,XXVI.,
556,XXVI.,"The moth-fly, as he shot in air,"
557,XXVI.,"Crept under the leaf, and hid her there;"
558,XXVI.,"The katy-did forgot its lay,"
559,XXVI.,"The prowling gnat fled fast away,"
560,XXVI.,The fell mosqueto checked his drone
561,XXVI.,"And folded his wings till the Fay was gone,"
562,XXVI.,"And the wily beetle dropped his head,"
563,XXVI.,And fell on the ground as if he were dead;
564,XXVI.,"They crouched them close in the darksome shade,"
565,XXVI.,"They quaked all o'er with awe and fear,"
566,XXVI.,"For they had felt the blue-bent blade,"
567,XXVI.,And writhed at the prick of the elfin spear;
568,XXVI.,"Many a time on a summer's night,"
569,XXVI.,"When the sky was clear and the moon was bright,"
570,XXVI.,"They had been roused from the haunted ground,"
571,XXVI.,By the yelp and bay of the fairy hound;
572,XXVI.,"They had heard the tiny bugle horn,"
573,XXVI.,"They had heard of twang of the maize-silk string,"
574,XXVI.,"When the vine-twig bows were tightly drawn,"
575,XXVI.,"And the nettle-shaft through the air was borne,"
576,XXVI.,Feathered with down the hum-bird's wing.
577,XXVI.,"And now they deemed the courier ouphe,"
578,XXVI.,Some hunter sprite of the elfin ground;
579,XXVI.,And they watched till they saw him mount the roof
580,XXVI.,That canopies the world around;
581,XXVI.,"Then glad they left their covert lair,"
582,XXVI.,And freaked about in the midnight air.
583,XXVI.,
584,XXVII.,XXVII.
585,XXVII.,
586,XXVII.,Up to the vaulted firmament
587,XXVII.,"His path the fire-fly courser bent,"
588,XXVII.,"And at every gallop on the wind,"
589,XXVII.,He flung a glittering spark behind;
590,XXVII.,He flies like a feather in the blast
591,XXVII.,"Till the first light cloud in heaven is past,"
592,XXVII.,"But the shapes of air have begun their work,"
593,XXVII.,"And a drizzly mist is round him cast,"
594,XXVII.,"He cannot see through the mantle murk,"
595,XXVII.,"He shivers with cold, but he urges fast,"
596,XXVII.,"Through storm and darkness, sleet and shade,"
597,XXVII.,"He lashes his steed and spurs amain,"
598,XXVII.,"For shadowy hands have twitched the rein,"
599,XXVII.,"And flame-shot tongues around him played,"
600,XXVII.,And near him many a fiendish eye
601,XXVII.,"Glared with a fell malignity,"
602,XXVII.,"And yells of rage, and shrieks of fear,"
603,XXVII.,Came screaming on his startled ear.
604,XXVII.,
605,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
606,XXVIII.,
607,XXVIII.,"His wings are wet around his breast,"
608,XXVIII.,"The plume hangs dripping from his crest,"
609,XXVIII.,"His eyes are blur'd with the lightning's glare,"
610,XXVIII.,"And his ears are stunned with the thunder's blare,"
611,XXVIII.,"But he gave a shout, and his blade he drew,"
612,XXVIII.,"He thrust before and he struck behind,"
613,XXVIII.,"Till he pierced their cloudy bodies through,"
614,XXVIII.,And gashed their shadowy limbs of wind;
615,XXVIII.,"Howling the misty spectres flew,"
616,XXVIII.,"They rend the air with frightful cries,"
617,XXVIII.,"For he has gained the welkin blue,"
618,XXVIII.,And the land of clouds beneath him lies.

622,XXIX.,Up to the cope careering swift
623,XXIX.,"In breathless motion fast,"

625,XXIX.,"Or the sea-roc rides the blast,"
626,XXIX.,"The sapphire sheet of eve is shot,"
627,XXIX.,"The sphered moon is past,"
628,XXIX.,The earth but seems a tiny blot
629,XXIX.,On a sheet of azure cast.
630,XXIX.,"O! it was sweet in the clear moonlight,"
631,XXIX.,"To tread the starry plain of even,"
632,XXIX.,"To meet the thousand eyes of night,"
633,XXIX.,And feel the cooling breath of heaven!
634,XXIX.,But the Elfin made no stop or stay
635,XXIX.,"Till he came to the bank of the milky-way,"
636,XXIX.,"Then he checked his courser's foot,"
637,XXIX.,And watched for the glimpse of the planet-shoot.

641,XXX.,Sudden along the snowy tide
642,XXX.,"That swelled to meet their footstep's fall,"

644,XXX.,Attired in sunset's crimson pall;
645,XXX.,"Around the Fay they weave the dance,"
646,XXX.,"They skip before him on the plain,"
647,XXX.,"And one has taken his wasp-sting lance,"
648,XXX.,And one upholds his bridle rein;
649,XXX.,With warblings wild they lead him on
650,XXX.,"To where through clouds of amber seen,"
651,XXX.,"Studded with stars, resplendent shone"
652,XXX.,The palace of the sylphid queen.
653,XXX.,Its spiral columns gleaming bright
654,XXX.,Were streamers of the northern light;
655,XXX.,Its curtain's light and lovely flush
656,XXX.,"Was of the morning's rosy blush,"
657,XXX.,And the ceiling fair that rose aboon
658,XXX.,The white and feathery fleece of noon.
659,XXX.,
660,XXXI.,XXXI.
661,XXXI.,
662,XXXI.,But oh! how fair the shape that lay
663,XXXI.,"Beneath a rainbow bending bright,"
664,XXXI.,She seemed to the entranced Fay
665,XXXI.,The loveliest of the forms of light;
666,XXXI.,Her mantle was the purple rolled
667,XXXI.,At twilight in the west afar;
668,XXXI.,"'Twas tied with threads of dawning gold,"
669,XXXI.,And buttoned with a sparkling star.
670,XXXI.,Her face was like the lily roon
671,XXXI.,That veils the vestal planet's hue;
672,XXXI.,"Her eyes, two beamlets from the moon,"
673,XXXI.,Set floating in the welkin blue.
674,XXXI.,"Her hair is like the sunny beam,"
675,XXXI.,And the diamond gems which round it gleam
676,XXXI.,Are the pure drops of dewy even
677,XXXI.,That ne'er have left their native heaven.
678,XXXI.,
679,XXXII.,XXXII.

681,XXXII.,"She raised her eyes to the wondering sprite,"
682,XXXII.,"And they leapt with smiles, for well I ween"
683,XXXII.,Never before in the bowers of light
684,XXXII.,Had the form of an earthly Fay been seen.
685,XXXII.,Long she looked in his tiny face;
686,XXXII.,Long with his butterfly cloak she played;
687,XXXII.,"She smoothed his wings of azure lace,"
688,XXXII.,And handled the tassel of his blade;
689,XXXII.,And as he told in accents low
690,XXXII.,"The story of his love and wo,"
691,XXXII.,"She felt new pains in her bosom rise,"
692,XXXII.,And the tear-drop started in her eyes.
693,XXXII.,"And 'O sweet spirit of earth,' she cried,"
694,XXXII.,"'Return no more to your woodland height,"
695,XXXII.,But ever here with me abide
696,XXXII.,In the land of everlasting light!
697,XXXII.,"Within the fleecy drift we'll lie,"
698,XXXII.,We'll hang upon the rainbow's rim;
699,XXXII.,And all the jewels of the sky
700,XXXII.,Around thy brow shall brightly beam!
701,XXXII.,And thou shalt bathe thee in the stream
702,XXXII.,"That rolls its whitening foam aboon,"
703,XXXII.,"And ride upon the lightning's gleam,"
704,XXXII.,And dance upon the orbed moon!
705,XXXII.,"We'll sit within the Pleiad ring,"
706,XXXII.,"We'll rest on Orion's starry belt,"
707,XXXII.,And I will bid my sylphs to sing
708,XXXII.,The song that makes the dew-mist melt;
709,XXXII.,"Their harps are of the umber shade,"
710,XXXII.,"That hides the blush of waking day,"
711,XXXII.,And every gleamy string is made
712,XXXII.,Of silvery moonshine's lengthened ray;
713,XXXII.,"And thou shalt pillow on my breast,"
714,XXXII.,"While heavenly breathings float around,"
715,XXXII.,"And, with the sylphs of ether blest,"
716,XXXII.,Forget the joys of fairy ground.'

720,XXXIII.,She was lovely and fair to see
721,XXXIII.,And the elfin's heart beat fitfully;
722,XXXIII.,"But lovelier far, and still more fair,"
723,XXXIII.,The earthly form imprinted there;
724,XXXIII.,Nought he saw in the heavens above
725,XXXIII.,"Was half so dear as his mortal love,"
726,XXXIII.,"For he thought upon her looks so meek,"
727,XXXIII.,And he thought of the light flush on her cheek;
728,XXXIII.,Never again might he bask and lie
729,XXXIII.,"On that sweet cheek and moonlight eye,"
730,XXXIII.,"But in his dreams her form to see,"
731,XXXIII.,"To clasp her in his reverie,"
732,XXXIII.,"To think upon his virgin bride,"
733,XXXIII.,Was worth all heaven and earth beside.

737,XXXIV.,"'Lady,' he cried, 'I have sworn to-night,"

740,XXXIV.,"My honour scarce is free from stain,"
741,XXXIV.,I may not soil its snows again;
742,XXXIV.,"Betide me weal, betide me wo,"
743,XXXIV.,Its mandate must be answered now.'
744,XXXIV.,"Her bosom heaved with many a sigh,"
745,XXXIV.,The tear was in her drooping eye;
746,XXXIV.,"But she led him to the palace gate,"
747,XXXIV.,"And called the sylphs who hovered there,"
748,XXXIV.,And bade them fly and bring him straight
749,XXXIV.,Of clouds condensed a sable car.
750,XXXIV.,"With charm and spell she blessed it there,"
751,XXXIV.,From all the fiends of upper air;
752,XXXIV.,"Then round him cast the shadowy shroud,"
753,XXXIV.,And tied his steed behind the cloud;
754,XXXIV.,And pressed his hand as she bade him fly
755,XXXIV.,"Far to the verge of the northern sky,"
756,XXXIV.,For by its wane and wavering light
757,XXXIV.,There was a star would fall to-night.

764,XXXV.,Till the hoof-strokes fall like pattering rain.
765,XXXV.,"The clouds roll backward as he flies,"
766,XXXV.,"Each flickering star behind him lies,"
767,XXXV.,"And he has reached the northern plain,"
768,XXXV.,"And backed his fire-fly steed again,"
769,XXXV.,Ready to follow in its flight
770,XXXV.,The streaming of the rocket-light.
771,XXXV.,
772,XXXVI.,XXXVI.

777,XXXVI.,And now 'tis deadly pale;
778,XXXVI.,"And now 'tis wrapp'd in sulphur smoke,"
779,XXXVI.,"And quenched is its rayless beam,"
780,XXXVI.,And now with a rattling thunder-stroke
781,XXXVI.,It bursts in flash and flame.
782,XXXVI.,As swift as the glance of the arrowy lance
783,XXXVI.,"That the storm-spirit flings from high,"
784,XXXVI.,"The star-shot flew o'er the welkin blue,"
785,XXXVI.,As it fell from the sheeted sky.
786,XXXVI.,As swift as the wind in its trail behind
787,XXXVI.,"The elfin gallops along,"
788,XXXVI.,"The fiends of the clouds are bellowing loud,"
789,XXXVI.,But the sylphid charm is strong;
790,XXXVI.,"He gallops unhurt in the shower of fire,"
791,XXXVI.,While the cloud-fiends fly from the blaze;
792,XXXVI.,"He watches each flake till its sparks expire,"
793,XXXVI.,And rides in the light of its rays.
794,XXXVI.,"But he drove his steed to the lightning's speed,"
795,XXXVI.,And caught a glimmering spark;
796,XXXVI.,"Then wheeled around to the fairy ground,"

1023,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"It is a summer evening, calm and fair,"
1024,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"A warm, yet freshening glow is in the air;"
1025,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Along its bank, the cool stream wanders slow,"

1027,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"The willows, as its waters meekly glide,"
1028,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Bend their dishevelled tresses to the tide,"
1029,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And seem to give it, with a moaning sigh,"
1030,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,A farewell touch of tearful sympathy.
1031,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Each dusky copse is clad in darkest green:
1032,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"A blackening mass, just edged with silver sheen"
1033,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"From yon clear moon, who in her glassy face"
1034,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Seems to reflect the risings of the place.
1035,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"For on her still, pale orb, the eye may see"
1036,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Dim spots of shadowy brown, like distant tree"

1043,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Or cygnet's wail--or song of sorrowing fays
1044,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"That float amid the moonshine glimmerings pale,"
1045,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,On wings of woven air in some enchanted vale.
1046,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1047,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"It is an eve that drops a heavenly balm,"
1048,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"To lull the feelings to a sober calm,"
1049,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,To bid wild passion's fiery flush depart;
1050,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And smooth the troubled waters of the heart;
1051,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"To give a tranquil fixedness to grief,"
1052,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"A cherished gloom, that wishes not relief."
1053,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1054,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Torn is that heart, and bitter are its throes,"
1055,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"That cannot feel on such a night, repose;"

1059,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Of mild, unclouded blue; and still that eye"
1060,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Is thrown in restless vacancy around,"

1064,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1065,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"A lovely figure! and in happier hour,"
1066,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"When pleasure laugh'd abroad from hall and bower,"
1067,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,The general eye had deem'd her smiling face
1068,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,The brightest jewel in the courtly place:
1069,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"So glossy is her hair's ensabled wreath,"
1070,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,So glowing warm the eye that burns beneath
1071,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"With so much graceful sweetness of address,"
1072,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And such a form of rounded slenderness;
1073,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Ah! where is he on whom these beauties shine,"
1074,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,But deems a spotless soul inhabits such a shrine?
1075,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1076,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And yet a keen observer might espy
1077,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Strange passions lurking in her deep black eye,"
1078,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And in the lines of her fine lip, a soul"
1079,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,That in its every feeling spurned control.
1080,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,They passed unnoted--who will stop to trace
1081,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,A sullying spot on beauty's sparkling face?
1082,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And no one deemed, amid her glances sweet,"
1083,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Hers was a bosom of impetuous heat;
1084,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"A heart too wildly in its joys elate,"
1085,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Formed but to madly love--or madly hate;
1086,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"A spirit of strong throbs, and steadfast will;"
1087,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"To doat, detest, to die for, or to kill;"
1088,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Which, like the Arab chief, would fiercely dare"
1089,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,To stab the heart she might no longer share;
1090,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And yet so tender, if he loved again,"
1091,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Would die to save his breast one moment's pain.
1092,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1093,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"But he who cast his gaze upon her now,"
1094,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And read the traces written on her brow,"
1095,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Had scarce believed hers was that form of light
1096,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,That beamed like fabled wonder on the sight;
1097,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Her raven hair hung down in loosen'd tress
1098,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Before her wan cheek's pallid ghastliness;
1099,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And, thro' its thick locks, showed the deadly white,"
1100,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Like marble glimpses of a tomb, at night."
1101,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"In fixed and horrid musings now she stands,"
1102,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Her eyes now bent to earth, and her cold hands,"
1103,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Prest to her heart, now wildly thrown on high,"
1104,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,They wander o'er her brow--and now a sigh
1105,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Breaks deep and full--and, more composedly,"
1106,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"She half exclaims--""No! no!--it cannot be;"
1107,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""He loves not, never loved-- not even when"
1108,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""He pressed my wedded hand--I knew it then;"
1109,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""And yet--fool that I was--I saw he strove"
1110,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""In vain to kindle pity into love."
1111,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""But Florence! she so loved--a sister too!"
1112,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""My earliest, dearest playmate--one who grew"
1113,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""Upon my very heart--to rend it so!"
1114,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""His falsehood I could bear--but hers! ah! no."
1115,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""She is not false--I feel she loves me yet,"
1116,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""And if my boding bosom could forget"
1117,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""Its wild imaginings, with what sweet pain"
1118,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""I'd clasp my Florence to my breast again."""
1119,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"With that came many a thought of days gone by,"
1120,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Remembered joys of mirthful infancy;
1121,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And youth's gay frolic, and the short-lived flow"
1122,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Of showering tears, in childhood's fleeting wo,"
1123,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And life's maturer friendship--and the sense
1124,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Of heart-warm, open, fearless confidence;"
1125,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"All these came thronging with a tender call,"
1126,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And her own Florence mingled with them all.
1127,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And softened feelings rose amid her pain,"
1128,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"While from her eyes, the clouds, melted in gentle rain."
1129,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1130,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,A hectic pleasure flushed her faded face;
1131,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,It fled--and deeper paleness took its place;
1132,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Then a cold shudder thrill'd her--and, at last,"
1133,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Her lip a smile of bitter sarcasm cast,"
1134,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"As if she scorned herself, that she could be"
1135,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,A moment lulled by that sweet sophistry;
1136,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,For in that little minute memory's sting
1137,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Gave word and look, sigh, gesture--every thing,"
1138,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"To bid these dear delusive phantoms fly,"
1139,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And fix her fears in dreadful certainty.
1140,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1141,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"It traced the very progress of their love,"
1142,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,From the first meeting in the locust grove;
1143,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"When from the chase Leon came bounding there,"
1144,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Backing his courser with a noble air;
1145,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"His brown cheek flushed with healthful exercise,"
1146,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And his warm spirits leaping in his eyes;
1147,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"It told how lovely looked her sister then,"
1148,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"To long-lost friends, and home just come again;"
1149,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"How on her cheek the tears of meeting lay,"
1150,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,That tear which only feeling hearts can pay;
1151,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"While the quick pleasure glistened in her eye,"
1152,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Like clouds and sunshine in an April sky;
1153,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And then it told, as their acquaintance grew,"
1154,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,How close the unseen bonds of union drew
1155,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Their souls together, and how pleased they were"
1156,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,The same blythe pastimes and delights to share;
1157,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"How the same chord in each at once would strike,"
1158,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Their taste, their wishes, and their joys alike."
1159,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1160,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"All this was innocent, but soon there came"
1161,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Blushes and starts of consciousness and shame;
1162,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"That, when she entered, upon either cheek"
1163,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,The hasty blood in guilty red would speak
1164,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Of something that should not be known--and still
1165,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Sighs half suppressed seemed struggling with the will.
1166,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,It told how oft at eve was Leon gone
1167,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,In moody wandering to the wood alone;
1168,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And in the night, how many a broken dream"
1169,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Of bliss, or terror, seemed to shake his frame."
1170,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"How Florence too, in long abstracted fit"
1171,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Of soul-wrapt musing, for whole hours would sit;"
1172,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Nor even the power of music, friend, or book,"
1173,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Could chase her deep forgetfulness of look;
1174,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And how, when questioned--with an indrawn sigh,"
1175,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"In vague and far-off phrase, she made reply,"
1176,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And smiled and struggled to be gay and free,"
1177,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And then relapsed in dreaming reverie.
1178,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"How when of Leon she was forced to speak,"
1179,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Unbidden crimson mantled in her cheek;
1180,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And when he entered, how her eye would swim,"
1181,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And strive to look on every one but him;
1182,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Yet, by unconscious fascination led,"
1183,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,In quick short glance each moment tow'rds him fled.
1184,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"How he, too, seemed to shun her speech and gaze,"
1185,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And yet he always lingered where she was;
1186,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Though nothing in his aspect or his air
1187,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Told that he knew she was in presence there;
1188,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"But an appearance of constrained distress,"
1189,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And a dull tongue of moveless silentness,"
1190,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And a down drooping eye of gloom and sadness,"
1191,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Oh! how unlike his former face of gladness.
1192,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"""'Tis plain! too plain! and I am lost,"" she cried;"
1193,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And in that thought her last good feeling died.
1194,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1195,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,That thought of hopeless sorrow seemed to dart
1196,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,A thousand stings at once into her heart;
1197,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"But a strong effort quelled it, and she gave"
1198,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"The next to hatred, vengeance, and the grave."
1199,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Her face was calmly stern, and but a glare"
1200,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Within her eyes--there was no feature there
1201,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,That told what lashing fiends her inmates were;
1202,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Within--there was no thought to bid her swerve
1203,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,From her intent--but every strained nerve
1204,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Was settled and bent up with terrible force,"
1205,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"To some deep deed, far, far beyond remorse;"
1206,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"No glimpse of mercy's light her purpose crost,"
1207,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Love, nature, pity, in its depths were lost;"
1208,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Or lent an added fury to the ire
1209,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,That seared her soul with unconsuming fire;
1210,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"All that was dear in the wide earth was gone,"
1211,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"She loved but two, and these she doted on"
1212,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,With passionate ardour--and the close strong press
1213,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Of woman's heart-cored, clinging tenderness;"
1214,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"These links were torn, and now she stood alone,"
1215,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Bereft of all, her husband, sister--gone!"
1216,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Ah! who can tell that ne'er has known such fate,"
1217,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,What wild and dreadful strength it gives to hate?
1218,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,What had she left? Revenge!  Revenge! was there;
1219,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,He crushed remorse and wrestled down despair:
1220,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Held his red torch to memory's page, and threw"
1221,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,A bloody stain on every line she drew;
1222,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"She felt dark pleasure with her frenzy blend,"
1223,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And hugged him to her heart, and called him friend."
1224,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1225,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"When sorrowing clouds the face of heaven deform,"
1226,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And hope's bright star sets darkly in the storm,"
1227,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Around us ghastly shapes and phantoms swim,"
1228,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And all beyond is formless, vague, and dim,"
1229,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Or life's cold barren path before us lies,"
1230,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,A wild and weary waste of tears and sighs;
1231,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"From the lorn heart each sweetening solace gone,"
1232,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Abandoned, friendless, withered, lost, and lone;"
1233,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And when with keener pangs we bleed to know
1234,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,That hands beloved have struck the deepest blow;
1235,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"That friends we deemed most true, and held most dear,"
1236,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Have stretched the pall of death o'er pleasure's bier;
1237,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Repaid our trusting faith with serpent guile,"
1238,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Cursed with a kiss, and stabbed beneath a smile;"
1239,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,What then remains for souls of tender mould?
1240,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"One last and silent refuge, calm and cold--"
1241,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,A resting place for misery's gentle slave;
1242,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Hearts break but once, no wrongs can reach the grave."
1243,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1244,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Rest ye, mild spirits of afflicted worth!"
1245,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Sweet is your slumber in the quiet earth;
1246,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And soon the voice of heaven shall bid you rise
1247,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,To meet rewarding smiles in yonder skies.
1248,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"But where, for solace, shall the bosom turn"
1249,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,For death too strong--for tears--too proudly stern?
1250,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,When shall the lulling dews of peace descend
1251,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,On hearts that cannot break and will not bend?
1252,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Ah! never, never--they are doomed to feel"
1253,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Pains that no balm of heaven or earth can heal;
1254,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"To live in groans, and yield their parting breath"
1255,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Without a joy in life--or hope in death.
1256,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Yet, for a while, one living hope remains,"
1257,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,That nerves each fibre and the soul sustains;
1258,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"One desperate hope, whose agonizing throes"
1259,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Are bitterer far than all the worst of woes;
1260,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"A hope of crime and horrors, wild and strange"
1261,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"As demon thoughts--that hope is thine, Revenge!"
1262,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"'Twas this that gave, oh! Ellinor, to thee"
1263,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,A strength to bear thy matchless misery:
1264,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Though the hot blood ran boiling in her brain,"
1265,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And rolled a tide of fire through every vein,"
1266,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Though many a rushing voice of blighted bliss
1267,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Struck on her mental ears, like adders' hiss;"
1268,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"That hope gave gloomy fierceness to her eye,"
1269,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Dash'd down the tear, repress'd the unloading sigh;"
1270,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Fixed her wan quivering lip, and steeled her breast"
1271,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,To crush the hearts that robbed her own of rest.
1272,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1273,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,She wound her way within a heavy shade
1274,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Of arching boughs, in broad-spread leaves arrayed;"
1275,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Which, clustering close and thick, shut out the light,"
1276,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And tinged with black the shadowy robe of night;
1277,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Save here and there a melancholy spark
1278,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Of flickering moonshine glimmered through the dark,"
1279,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Cheerless and dim, as when upon a pall,"
1280,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Through suffering tears, the looks of sorrow fall;"
1281,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"But opening farther on, on either side"
1282,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,A wider space the severing trees divide;
1283,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And longer gleams upon the pathway meet,"
1284,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And the soft grass is wet beneath her feet.
1285,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And now emerging from the darksome shade,"
1286,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,She pressed the silken carpet of the glade.
1287,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Beyond the green, within its western close,"
1288,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"A little vine-hung, leafy arbor rose,"
1289,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Where the pale lustre of the moony flood
1290,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Dimm'd the vermillion'd woodbine's scarlet bud;
1291,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And glancing through the foliage fluttering round,"
1292,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,In tiny circles gemm'd the freckled ground.
1293,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Beside the porch, beneath the friendly screen"
1294,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Of two tall trees, a mossy bank was seen;"
1295,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And all around, amid the silvery dew,"
1296,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,The wild-wood pansy rear'd her petals blue;
1297,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And gold cups and the meadow cowslip red,"
1298,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Upon the evening air their odours shed.
1299,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1300,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Unheeded all the grove's deep gloom had been,"
1301,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Unseen the moonlight brightness of the green;
1302,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"In vain the stream's blue burnish met her eye,"
1303,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Lovely its wave, but pass'd unnoticed by:"
1304,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,The airs of heaven had breath'd around her brow
1305,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Their cooling sighs--she felt them not--but now
1306,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"That lonely bower appeared, and with a start"
1307,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Convulsive shudders thrill'd her throbbing heart.
1308,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"For there, in days, alas! for ever gone,"
1309,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"When love's young torch with beams of rapture shone,"
1310,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"When she had felt her heart's impassioned swell,"
1311,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And almost deem'd her Leon loved as well;
1312,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"There had she sat, beneath the evening skies,"
1313,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,Felt his warm kiss and heard his murmur'd sighs;
1314,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Hung on his breast, caressing and carest,"
1315,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Her husband smiled, and Ellinor was blest."
1316,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,
1317,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"And when his injured country's rights to shield,"
1318,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"Blazed his red banner on the battle field,"
1319,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,"There had she lingered in the shadows dim,"
1320,AN UNFINISHED POEM.,And sat till morning watch and thought of him;
