211,ARMAZINDY,"As her Daddy answered it,"

216,ARMAZINDY,"But, i jucks! it _ort_ to be!"
217,ARMAZINDY,Folks is got respec’ fer _her_—
218,ARMAZINDY,Armazindy Ballenger!—
219,ARMAZINDY,’Specially the ones ’at knows
220,ARMAZINDY,Fac’s o’ how her story goes
221,ARMAZINDY,From the start:—Her father blowed
222,ARMAZINDY,Up—eternally furloughed—
223,ARMAZINDY,"When the old “Sultana” bu’st,"
224,ARMAZINDY,And sich men wuz needed wusst.—
225,ARMAZINDY,"Armazindy, ’bout fourteen-"
226,ARMAZINDY,Year-old then—and thin and lean
227,ARMAZINDY,"As a killdee,—but—_my la!_—"
228,ARMAZINDY,Blamedest nerve you ever saw!
229,ARMAZINDY,The girl’s mother’d _allus_ be’n
230,ARMAZINDY,Sickly—wuz consumpted when
231,ARMAZINDY,Word came ’bout her husband.—So
232,ARMAZINDY,Folks perdicted _she’d_ soon go—
233,ARMAZINDY,"(Kind o’ grief _I_ understand,"
234,ARMAZINDY,"Losin’ _my_ companion,—and"
235,ARMAZINDY,Still a widower—and still
236,ARMAZINDY,"Hinted at, like neighbers will!)"
237,ARMAZINDY,"So, app’inted, as folks said,"
238,ARMAZINDY,"Ballenger a-bein’ dead,"
239,ARMAZINDY,"Widder, ’peared-like, gradjully,"
240,ARMAZINDY,Jes grieved after him tel _she_
241,ARMAZINDY,"Died, nex’ Aprile wuz a year,—"
242,ARMAZINDY,And in Armazindy’s keer
243,ARMAZINDY,"Leavin’ the two twins, as well"
244,ARMAZINDY,As her pore old miz’able
245,ARMAZINDY,Old-maid aunty ’at had be’n
246,ARMAZINDY,"Struck with palsy, and wuz then"
247,ARMAZINDY,Jes a he’pless charge on _her_—
248,ARMAZINDY,_Armazindy Ballenger_.
249,ARMAZINDY,
250,ARMAZINDY,Jevver watch a primrose ’bout
251,ARMAZINDY,Minute ’fore it blossoms out—
252,ARMAZINDY,"Kindo’ loosen-like, and blow"
253,ARMAZINDY,"Up its muscles, don’t you know,"
254,ARMAZINDY,"And, all suddent, bu’st and bloom"
255,ARMAZINDY,"Out life-size?—Well, I persume"
256,ARMAZINDY,’At’s the only measure I
257,ARMAZINDY,_Kin_ size Armazindy by!—
258,ARMAZINDY,"Jes a _child_, _one_ minute,—nex’,"
259,ARMAZINDY,"_Woman-grown_, in all respec’s"
260,ARMAZINDY,And intents and purposuz—
261,ARMAZINDY,’At’s what Armazindy wuz!
262,ARMAZINDY,
263,ARMAZINDY,"Jes a _child_, I tell ye! Yit"
264,ARMAZINDY,She made things git up and git
265,ARMAZINDY,Round that little farm o’ hern!—
266,ARMAZINDY,Shouldered all the whole concern;—
267,ARMAZINDY,"Feed the stock, and milk the cows—"
268,ARMAZINDY,Run the _farm_ and run the _house_!—
269,ARMAZINDY,_Only_ thing she didn’t do
270,ARMAZINDY,Wuz to plough and harvest too—
271,ARMAZINDY,But the house and childern took
272,ARMAZINDY,Lots o’ keer—and had to look
273,ARMAZINDY,After her old fittified
274,ARMAZINDY,"Grandaunt.—Lord! ye could’a’ cried,"
275,ARMAZINDY,"Seein’ Armazindy smile,"
276,ARMAZINDY,"’Peared-like, sweeter all the while!"
277,ARMAZINDY,And I’ve heerd her laugh and say:—
278,ARMAZINDY,"“Jes afore Pap marched away,"
279,ARMAZINDY,"He says, ‘I depend on _you_,"
280,ARMAZINDY,"Armazindy, come what may—"
281,ARMAZINDY,"You must be a Soldier, too!’”"
282,ARMAZINDY,
283,ARMAZINDY,"Neighbers, from the fust, ’ud come—"
284,ARMAZINDY,"And she’d _let_ ’em help her _some_,—"
285,ARMAZINDY,"“Thanky, ma’am!” and “Thanky, sir!”"
286,ARMAZINDY,But no charity fer _her_!—
287,ARMAZINDY,“_She_ could raise the means to pay
288,ARMAZINDY,Fer her farm-hands ever’ day
289,ARMAZINDY,Sich wuz needed!”—And she _could_—
290,ARMAZINDY,In cash-money jes as good
291,ARMAZINDY,As farm-produc’s ever brung
292,ARMAZINDY,"Their perducer, _old_ er young!"
293,ARMAZINDY,"So folks humored her and smiled,"
294,ARMAZINDY,And at last wuz rickonciled
295,ARMAZINDY,Fer to let her have her own
296,ARMAZINDY,Way about it.—But a-goin’
297,ARMAZINDY,"Past to town, they’d stop and see"
298,ARMAZINDY,"“Armazindy’s fambily,”"
299,ARMAZINDY,"As they’d allus laugh and say,"
300,ARMAZINDY,"And look sorry right away,"
301,ARMAZINDY,"Thinkin’ of her Pap, and how"
302,ARMAZINDY,He’d indorse his “Soldier” now!
303,ARMAZINDY,’Course _she_ couldn’t never be
304,ARMAZINDY,Much in _young-folks’_ company—
305,ARMAZINDY,"Plenty of _in_-vites to go,"
306,ARMAZINDY,"But das’t leave the house, you know—"
307,ARMAZINDY,"’Less’n _Sund’ys_ sometimes, when"
308,ARMAZINDY,Some old _Granny_’d come and ’ten’
309,ARMAZINDY,"Things, while Armazindy _has_"
310,ARMAZINDY,Got away fer Church er “Class.”
311,ARMAZINDY,Most the youngsters _liked_ her—and
312,ARMAZINDY,"’Twuzn’t hard to understand,—"
313,ARMAZINDY,"Fer, by time she wuz sixteen,"
314,ARMAZINDY,Purtier girl you never seen—
315,ARMAZINDY,"’Ceptin’ she lacked schoolin’, ner"
316,ARMAZINDY,Couldn’t rag out stylisher—
317,ARMAZINDY,"Like some _neighber_-girls, ner thumb"
318,ARMAZINDY,"On their blame’ melodium,"
319,ARMAZINDY,Whilse their pore old mothers sloshed
320,ARMAZINDY,Round the old back-porch and washed
321,ARMAZINDY,Their clothes fer ’em—rubbed and scrubbed
322,ARMAZINDY,Fer girls’d ort to jes be’n clubbed!
323,ARMAZINDY,
324,ARMAZINDY,—And jes sich a girl wuz Jule
325,ARMAZINDY,Reddinhouse.—_She’d_ be’n to school
326,ARMAZINDY,"At _New Thessaly_, i gum!—"
327,ARMAZINDY,"Fool before, but that he’pped _some_—"
328,ARMAZINDY,’Stablished-like more confidence
329,ARMAZINDY,’At she _never_ had no sense.
330,ARMAZINDY,"But she wuz a cunnin’, sly,"
331,ARMAZINDY,"Meek and lowly sort o’ lie,"
332,ARMAZINDY,’At men-folks like me and you

351,ARMAZINDY,"Went to town, she did, and bought"
352,ARMAZINDY,Lot o’ things ’at neighbers thought

413,ARMAZINDY,"As fer Jule and Sol, they had"
414,ARMAZINDY,Their sheer!—less o’ good than bad!—
415,ARMAZINDY,"Her folks let her go.—They said,"
416,ARMAZINDY,“Spite o’ them she’d made her bed
417,ARMAZINDY,"And must sleep in it!”—But she,"
418,ARMAZINDY,"’Peared-like, didn’t sleep so free"
419,ARMAZINDY,"As she ust to—ner so _late_,"
420,ARMAZINDY,"Ner so _fine_, I’m here to state!—"
421,ARMAZINDY,"Sol wuz pore, of course, and she"
422,ARMAZINDY,Wuzn’t ust to poverty—
423,ARMAZINDY,Ner she didn’t ’pear to jes
424,ARMAZINDY,"’Filiate with lonesomeness,—"
425,ARMAZINDY,’Cause Sol _he_ wuz off and out
426,ARMAZINDY,With his th’asher nigh about
427,ARMAZINDY,"Half the time; er, season done,"
428,ARMAZINDY,He’d be off mi-anderun
429,ARMAZINDY,"Round the country, here and there,"
430,ARMAZINDY,"Swoppin’ hosses. Well, that-air"
431,ARMAZINDY,Kind o’ livin’ didn’t suit
432,ARMAZINDY,"Jule a bit!—and then, to boot,"
433,ARMAZINDY,_She_ had now the keer o’ two
434,ARMAZINDY,Her own childern—and to do
435,ARMAZINDY,"Her own work and cookin’—yes,"
436,ARMAZINDY,"And sometimes fer _hands_, I guess,"
437,ARMAZINDY,Well as fambily of her own.—
438,ARMAZINDY,Cut her pride clean to the bone!
439,ARMAZINDY,So how _could_ the whole thing end?—
440,ARMAZINDY,"She set down, one night, and penned"
441,ARMAZINDY,"A short note, like—’at she sewed"
442,ARMAZINDY,On the childern’s blanket—blowed
443,ARMAZINDY,Out the candle—pulled the door
444,ARMAZINDY,"To close after her—and, shore-"
445,ARMAZINDY,"Footed as a cat is, clumb"
446,ARMAZINDY,"In a rigg there and left home,"
447,ARMAZINDY,With a man a-drivin’ who
448,ARMAZINDY,"“Loved her ever fond and true,”"
449,ARMAZINDY,"As her note went on to say,"
450,ARMAZINDY,When Sol read the thing next day.
451,ARMAZINDY,
452,ARMAZINDY,Raally didn’t ’pear to be
453,ARMAZINDY,Extry waste o’ sympathy
454,ARMAZINDY,"Over Sol—pore feller!—Yit,"
455,ARMAZINDY,Sake o’ them-air little bit
456,ARMAZINDY,O’ two _orphants_—as you might
457,ARMAZINDY,"Call ’em _then_, by law and right,—"
458,ARMAZINDY,"Sol’s old friends wuz sorry, and"
459,ARMAZINDY,Tried to hold him out their hand
460,ARMAZINDY,Same as allus: But he’d flinch—
461,ARMAZINDY,"Tel, jes ’peared-like, inch by inch,"
462,ARMAZINDY,He let _all_ holts go; and so
463,ARMAZINDY,"Took to drinkin’, don’t you know,—"
464,ARMAZINDY,"Tel, to make a long tale short,"
465,ARMAZINDY,He wuz fuller than he ort
466,ARMAZINDY,"To ’a’ be’n, at work one day"
467,ARMAZINDY,"’Bout his th’asher, and give way,"
468,ARMAZINDY,"Kindo’-like, and fell and ketched"
469,ARMAZINDY,In the beltin’.
470,ARMAZINDY,... Rid and fetched
471,ARMAZINDY,Armazindy to him.—He
472,ARMAZINDY,Begged me to.—But time ’at she
473,ARMAZINDY,"Reached his side, he smiled and _tried_"
474,ARMAZINDY,To speak.—Couldn’t. So he died....
475,ARMAZINDY,Hands all turned and left her there
476,ARMAZINDY,And went somers else—_some_where.
477,ARMAZINDY,"Last, she called us back—in clear"
478,ARMAZINDY,Voice as man’ll ever hear—
479,ARMAZINDY,"Clear and stiddy, ’peared to me,"
480,ARMAZINDY,As her old Pap’s ust to be.—
481,ARMAZINDY,Give us orders what to do
482,ARMAZINDY,"’Bout the body—he’pped us, too."
483,ARMAZINDY,"So it wuz, Sol Stephens passed"
484,ARMAZINDY,In Armazindy’s hands at last.
485,ARMAZINDY,"More’n that, she claimed ’at she"
486,ARMAZINDY,Had consent from him to be
487,ARMAZINDY,Mother to his childern—now
488,ARMAZINDY,’Thout no parents anyhow.
489,ARMAZINDY,
490,ARMAZINDY,"_Yes-sir!_ and she’s _got_ ’em, too,—"
491,ARMAZINDY,Folks saw nothin’ else ’ud do—
492,ARMAZINDY,So they let her have _her way_—
493,ARMAZINDY,Like she’s doin’ yit to-day!
494,ARMAZINDY,"Years now, I’ve be’n coaxin’ her—"
495,ARMAZINDY,Armazindy Ballenger—
496,ARMAZINDY,To in-large her fambily
497,ARMAZINDY,Jes _one_ more by takin’ _me_—
498,ARMAZINDY,"Which I’m feared she never will,"

512,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,But daintily drawn from its hiding at night.
513,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,"O a nest of delight, from the foot to the head,"
514,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,"Was the queer little, dear little, old trundle-bed!"
515,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,
516,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,"O the old trundle-bed, where I wondering saw"
517,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,"The stars through the window, and listened with awe"
518,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,To the sigh of the winds as they tremblingly crept
519,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,Through the trees where the robin so restlessly slept:
520,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,"Where I heard the low, murmurous chirp of the wren,"
521,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,"And the katydid listlessly chirrup again,"
522,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,Till my fancies grew faint and were drowsily led
523,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,Through the maze of the dreams of the old trundle-bed.
524,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,
525,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,O the old trundle-bed! O the old trundle-bed!
526,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,"With its plump little pillow, and old-fashioned spread;"
527,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,"Its snowy-white sheets, and the blankets above,"
528,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,Smoothed down and tucked round with the touches of
529,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,love;
530,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,The voice of my mother to lull me to sleep
531,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,With the old fairy stories my memories keep
532,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,Still fresh as the lilies that bloom o’er the head
533,THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED,Once bowed o’er my own in the old trundle-bed.

546,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,"Of wise elucidation,"

548,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,From simple observation.
549,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,
550,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,I notice _little_ things—to wit:—
551,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,I never missed a train
552,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,Because I didn’t _run_ for it;

556,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,"The sun but wore, to all intent,"
557,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,A jocular expression.
558,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,
559,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,I never knew a creditor

562,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,"I never knew one yet,"
563,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,"When I had plenty in my purse,"
564,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,"To make the least invasion,—"
565,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,"As I, accordingly perverse,"

567,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,

573,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,Disastrously exploded

578,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,"And what is worse by half,"

582,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,"And sparkling jests and liquor,"
583,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,Our hearts somehow are liable
584,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,To melt in tears the quicker.

591,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,"As wild and quick as tinder,"
592,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,The more you seek to help ahead
593,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,The more you seem to hinder.

596,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,"And, on the selfsame plan,"
597,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,The biggest fool I ever knew
598,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,Was quite a little man:

710,THE BLIND GIRL,He is so happy now!—To hear

712,THE BLIND GIRL,So ringing-sweet and clear!
713,THE BLIND GIRL,His step—I heard it long before
714,THE BLIND GIRL,He bounded through the open door
715,THE BLIND GIRL,To tell his marriage.—Ah! so kind—
716,THE BLIND GIRL,So good he is!—And I—so blind!
717,THE BLIND GIRL,
718,THE BLIND GIRL,But thus he always came to me—
719,THE BLIND GIRL,"Me, first of all, he used to bring"

1265,IV,"And through the storm of grief around her tossed,"
1266,IV,"One ray of saddest comfort she may see,—"
1267,IV,Four hundred thousand sons like hers were lost

2103,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2104,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2105,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,If my old school-chum and room-mate John Skinner is alive to-day—and
2106,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"no doubt he _is_ alive, and quite so, being, when last heard from, the"
2107,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"very alert and effective Train Dispatcher at Butler, Indiana,—he will"
2108,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"not have forgotten a certain night in early June (the 8th) of 1870,"
2109,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"in “Old Number ’Leven” of the Dunbar House, Greenfield, when he and I"
2110,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"sat the long night through, getting ready a famous issue of our old"
2111,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"school-paper, “The Criterion.” And he will remember, too, the queer"
2112,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"old man who occupied, but that one night, the room just opposite our"
2113,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"own, Number 13. For reasons wholly aside from any superstitious dread"
2114,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"connected with the numerals, 13 was not a desirable room; its locality"
2115,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"was alien to all accommodations, and its comforts, like its furnishings,"
2116,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"were extremely meagre. In fact, it was the room usually assigned to the"
2117,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"tramp-printer, who, in those days, was an institution; or again, it was"
2118,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,the local habitation of the oft-recurring transient customer who was too
2119,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"incapacitated to select a room himself when he retired—or rather, when he"
2120,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"was personally retired by “the hostler,” as the gentlemanly night-clerk"
2121,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,of that era was habitually designated.
2122,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2123,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,As both Skinner and myself—between fitful terms of school—had
2124,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,respectively served as “printer’s devil” in the two rival newspaper
2125,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"offices of the town, it was natural for us to find a ready interest"
2126,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"in anything pertaining to the newspaper business; and so it was,"
2127,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"perhaps, that we had been selected, by our own approval and that of our"
2128,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"fellow-students of The Graded Schools, to fill the rather exalted office"
2129,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,of editing “The Criterion.” Certain it is that the rather abrupt rise
2130,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,from the lowly duties of the “roller” to the editorial management of a
2131,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,paper of our own (even if issued in handwriting) we accepted as a natural
2132,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"right; and, vested in our new power of office, we were largely “shaping"
2133,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,the whisper of the throne” about our way.
2134,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2135,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"And upon this particular evening it was, as John and I had fairly squared"
2136,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"ourselves for the work of the night, that we heard the clatter and"
2137,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"shuffle of feet on the side-stairs, and, an instant later, the hostler"
2138,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"establishing some poor unfortunate in 13, just across the hall."
2139,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2140,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"“Listen!” said John, as we heard an old man’s voice through the open"
2141,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"transom of our door,—“listen at that!”"
2142,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2143,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"It was an utterance peculiarly refined, in language as well as"
2144,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"intonation. A low, mild, rather apologetic voice, gently assuring the"
2145,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,hostler that “everything was very snug and comfortable indeed—so far as
2146,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,the _compartment_ was concerned—but would not the _attendant_ kindly
2147,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"supply a better light, together with pen-and-ink—and just a sheet or two"
2148,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"of paper,—if he would be so very good as to find a pardon for so very"
2149,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,troublesome a guest.”
2150,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2151,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"“Hain’t no writin’-paper,” said the hostler, briefly,—“and the big lamps"
2152,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,is all in use. These fellers here in ’Leven might let you have some paper
2153,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,and—Hain’t _you_ got a lead-pencil?”
2154,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2155,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"“Oh, no matter!” came the impatient yet kindly answer of the old"
2156,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"voice—“no matter at all, my good fellow!—Good night—good night!”"
2157,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2158,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"We waited till the sullen, clumpy footsteps down the hall and stair had"
2159,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,died away.
2160,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2161,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"Then Skinner, with a handful of foolscap, opened our door; and, with"
2162,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"an indorsing smile from me, crossed the hall and tapped at 13—was"
2163,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"admitted—entered, and very quietly closed the door behind him, evidently"
2164,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,that I might not be disturbed.
2165,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2166,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"I wrote on in silence for quite a time. It was, in fact, a full half-hour"
2167,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"before John had returned,—and with a face and eye absolutely blazing with"
2168,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,delight.
2169,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2170,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"“An old printer,” whispered John, answering my look,—“and we’re in"
2171,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"luck:—He’s a _genius_, ’y God! and an Englishman, and knows Dickens"
2172,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"_personally_—used to write races with him, and’s got a manuscript of his"
2173,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"in his ‘portmanteau,’ as he calls an old oil-cloth knapsack with one lung"
2174,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"clean gone. Excuse this extra light.—Old man’s lamp’s like a sore eye,"
2175,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,and he’s going to touch up the Dickens sketch for _us_! _Hear?_—_For
2176,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,us_—for ‘The Criterion.’ Says he can’t sleep—he’s in distress—has
2177,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,a presentiment—some dear friend is dying—or dead now—and he must
2178,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,write—_write_!”
2179,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2180,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"This is, in briefest outline, the curious history of the subjoined"
2181,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"sketch, especially curious for the reason that the following morning’s"
2182,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"cablegram announced that the great novelist, Charles Dickens, had been"
2183,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,stricken suddenly and seriously the night previous. On the day of this
2184,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,announcement—even as “The Criterion” was being read to perfunctorily
2185,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,interested visitors of The Greenfield Graded Schools—came the further
2186,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"announcement of Mr. Dickens’s death. The old printer’s manuscript, here"
2187,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,"reproduced, is, as originally, captioned—"
2188,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2189,“TWIGGS AND TUDENS”,
2190,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,TWIGGS AND TUDENS
2191,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2192,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,“Now who’d want a more cosier little home than me and Tude’s got here?”
2193,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"asked Mr. Twiggs, as his twinkling eyes swept caressingly around the"
2194,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"cheery little room in which he, alone, stood one chill December evening"
2195,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,as the great St. Paul’s was drawling six.
2196,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2197,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“This ain’t no princely hall with all its gorgeous paraphanaly, as the"
2198,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"play-bills says; but it’s what I calls a’ ‘interior,’ which for meller"
2199,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,comfort and cheerful surroundin’s ain’t to be ekalled by no other
2200,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"‘flat’ on the boundless, never-endin’ stage of this existence!” And"
2201,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"as the exuberant Mr. Twiggs rendered this observation, he felt called"
2202,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"upon to smile and bow most graciously to an invisible audience, whose"
2203,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,wild approval he in turn interpreted by an enthusiastic clapping of his
2204,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,hands and the cry of “Ongcore!” in a dozen different keys—this strange
2205,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,acclamation being made the more grotesque by a great green parrot perched
2206,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"upon the mantel, which, in a voice less musical than penetrating, chimed"
2207,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,in with “Hooray for Twiggs and Tudens!” a very great number of times.
2208,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2209,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Tude’s a queer girl,” said Mr. Twiggs, subsiding into a reflective calm,"
2210,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"broken only by the puffing of his pipe, and the occasional articulation"
2211,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"of a thought, as it loitered through his mind. “Tude’s a queer girl!—a"
2212,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"werry queer girl!” repeated Mr. Twiggs, pausing again, with a long whiff"
2213,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"at his pipe, and marking the graceful swoop the smoke made as it dipped"
2214,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"and disappeared up the wide, black-throated chimney; and then, as though"
2215,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"dropping into confidence with the great fat kettle on the coals, that"
2216,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"steamed and bubbled with some inner paroxysm, he added, “And queer and"
2217,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"nothink short, is the lines for Tude, eh?"
2218,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2219,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Now s’posin’,” he continued, leaning forward and speaking in a tone"
2220,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,whose careful intonation might have suggested a more than ordinary depth
2221,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"of wisdom and sagacity,—“s’posin’ a pore chap like me, as ain’t no"
2222,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"property only this-’ere ‘little crooked house,’ as Tude calls it, and"
2223,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"some o’ the properties I ’andles at the Drury—as I was a-sayin’,—s’posin’"
2224,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"now a’ old rough chap like me was jest to tell her all about herself, and"
2225,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"who she is and all, and not no kith or kin o’ mine, let alone a daughter,"
2226,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"as _she_ thinks—What do you reckon now ’ud be the upshot, eh?” And as Mr."
2227,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,Twiggs propounded this mysterious query he jabbed the poker prankishly
2228,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"in the short-ribs of the grate, at which the pot, as though humoring a"
2229,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"joke it failed to comprehend wholly, set up a chuckling of such asthmatic"
2230,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,violence that its smothered cachinnations tilted its copper lid till Mr.
2231,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,Twiggs was obliged to dash a cup of water in its face.
2232,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2233,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“And Tude’s a-comin’ of a’ age, too,” continued Mr. Twiggs, “when a more"
2234,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"tenderer pertecter than a father, so to speak, wouldn’t be out o’ keepin’"
2235,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"with the nat’ral order o’ things, seein’ as how she’s sorto’ startin’"
2236,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"for herself-like now. And it’s a question in my mind, if it ain’t my"
2237,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"bounden duty as her father—or ruther, who has been a father to her all"
2238,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"her life—to kindo’ tell her jest how things is, and all—and how _I_ am,"
2239,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"and everythink,—and how I feel as though I ort’o stand by her, as I allus"
2240,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"have, and allus _have_ had her welfare in view, and kindo’ feel as how I"
2241,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,allus—ort’o kindo’—ort’o kindo’”—and here Mr. Twiggs’s voice fell into
2242,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,silence so abruptly that the drowsy parrot started from its trance-like
2243,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,quiet and cried “Ortokindo! Ortokindo!” with such a strength of seeming
2244,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,mockery that it was brushed violently to the floor by the angry hand of
2245,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,Mr. Twiggs and went backing awkwardly beneath the table.
2246,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2247,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Blow me,” said Mr. Twiggs, “if the knowin’ impidence of that-’ere bird"
2248,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"ain’t astonishin’!” And then, after a serious controversy with the"
2249,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"draught of his pipe, he went on with his deliberations."
2250,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2251,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,“Lor! it were jest scrumptious to see Tude in ‘The Iron Chest’ last
2252,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"night! Now, I ain’t no actur myself,—I’ve been on, of course, a thousand"
2253,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"times as ‘fillin’,’ ‘sogers’ and ‘peasants’ and the like, where I never"
2254,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"had no lines, on’y in the ‘choruses’; but if I don’t know nothin’ but"
2255,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,‘All hail!—All hail!’ I’ve had the experience of bein’ under the baleful
2256,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"hinfluence of the hoppery-glass, and I’m free to say it air a ticklish"
2257,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"position and no mistake. But _Tude_! w’y, bless you, she warn’t the"
2258,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"first bit flustered, was she? ’Peared-like she jest felt perfectly at"
2259,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,home-like—like her mother afore her! And I’m dashed if I didn’t feel the
2260,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,cold chills a-creepin’ and a-crawlin’ when she was a-singin’ ‘Down by the
2261,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,river there grows a green willer and a-weepin’ all night with the bank
2262,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,for her piller’; and when she come to the part about wantin’ to be buried
2263,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,there ’while the winds was a-blowin’ close by the stream where her tears
2264,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"was a-flowin’, and over her corpse to keep the green willers growin’,’"
2265,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,I’m d—d if I didn’t blubber right out!” And as the highly sympathetic Mr.
2266,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"Twiggs delivered this acknowledgment, he stroked the inner corners of his"
2267,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"eyes, and rubbed his thumb and finger on his trousers."
2268,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2269,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“It were a tryin’ thing, though,” he went on, his mellow features"
2270,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,settling into a look not at all in keeping with his shiny complexion—“it
2271,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"were a tryin’ thing, and it _air_ a tryin’ thing to see them lovely arms"
2272,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,o’ hern a-twinin’ so lovin’-like around that-’ere Stanley’s neck and
2273,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"a-kissin’ of him—as she’s obleeged to do, of course—as the ‘properties’"
2274,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,of the play demands; but I’m blowed if she wouldn’t do it quite so
2275,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"nat’ral-like I’d feel easier. Blow me!” he broke off savagely, starting"
2276,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"up and flinging his pipe in the ashes, “I’m about a-comin’ to the"
2277,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,conclusion I ain’t got no more courage’n a blasted school-boy! Here I am
2278,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,old enough to be her father—mighty nigh it—and yet I’m actually afeard to
2279,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"speak up and tell her jest how things is, and all, and how I feel like"
2280,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,I—like I—ort’o—ort’o—”
2281,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2282,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“_Ortokindo! Ortokindo!_” shrieked the parrot, clinging in a reversed"
2283,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,position to the under-round of a chair.—“_Ortokindo! Ortokindo! Tude’s
2284,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,come home!—Tude’s come home!_” And as though in happy proof of this
2285,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"latter assertion, the gentle Mr. Twiggs found his chubby neck encircled"
2286,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"by a pair of rosy arms, and felt upon his cheek the sudden pressure of"
2287,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,a pair of lips that thrilled his old heart to the core. And then the
2288,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,noisy bird dropped from its perch and marched pompously from its place of
2289,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"concealment, trailing its rusty wings and shrieking, “Tude’s come home!”"
2290,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,at the top of its brazen voice.
2291,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2292,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Shet up!” screamed Mr. Twiggs, with a pretended gust of rage, kicking"
2293,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"lamely at the feathered oracle; “I’ll ‘Tude’s-come-home’ ye! W’y, a"
2294,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"feller can’t hear his _ears_ for your infernal squawkin’!” And then,"
2295,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"turning toward the serious eyes that peered rebukingly into his own, his"
2296,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"voice fell gentle as a woman’s: “Well, there, Tudens, I beg parding;"
2297,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"I do indeed. Don’t look at me thataway. I know I’m a great, rough,"
2298,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"good-for—”But a warm, swift kiss cut short the utterance; and as the girl"
2299,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"drew back, still holding the bright old face between her tender palms, he"
2300,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"said simply, “You’re a queer girl, Tudens; a queer girl.”"
2301,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2302,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Ha! am I?” said the girl, in quite evident heroics and quotation,"
2303,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,starting back with a theatrical flourish and falling into a fantastic
2304,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"attitude.—“‘Troth, I am sorry for it; me poor father’s heart is bursting"
2305,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"with gratichude, and he would fain ease it by pouring out his thanks to"
2306,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,his benefactor.’”
2307,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2308,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Werry good! Werry good, indeed!” said Mr. Twiggs, gazing wistfully upon"
2309,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,the graceful figure of the girl. “You’re a-growin’ more wonderful’ clever
2310,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"in your ‘presence’ every day, Tude. You don’t think o’ nothink else but"
2311,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"your actin’, do ye, now?” And, as Mr. Twiggs concluded his observations,"
2312,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,a something very like a sigh came faltering from his lips.
2313,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2314,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Why, listen there! Ah-ha!” laughed Tude, clapping her hands and"
2315,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"dancing gayly around his chair.—“Why, you old melancholy Dane, you!"
2316,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"are you actually _sighing_?” Then, dropping into a tragic air of deep"
2317,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"contrition, she continued: “‘But, believe me, I would not question you,"
2318,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"but to console you, Wilford. I would scorn to pry into any one’s grief,"
2319,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"much more yours, Wilford, to satisfy a busy curiosity.’”"
2320,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2321,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Oh, don’t, Tude; don’t _rehearse_ like that at me!—I can’t a-bear it.”"
2322,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,And the serious Mr. Twiggs held out his hand as though warding off a
2323,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,blow. At this appeal the girl’s demeanor changed to one of tenderest
2324,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,solicitude.
2325,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2326,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Why, Pop’m,” she said, laying her hand on his shoulder, “I did not"
2327,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"mean to vex you—forgive me. I was only trying to be happy, as I ought,"
2328,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"although my own heart is this very minute heavy—very heavy—very.—No, no;"
2329,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"I don’t mean that—but, Father, Father, I have not been dutiful.”"
2330,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2331,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“W’y, yes, you have,” broke in Mr. Twiggs, smothering the heavy"
2332,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"exclamation in his handkerchief. “You ain’t been ondutiful, nor nothink"
2333,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,else. You’re jest all and everythink that heart could wish. It’s all
2334,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"my own fault, Tudens; it’s all my fault. You see, I git to thinkin’"
2335,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,sometimes like I was a-goin’ to _lose_ you; and now that you are a-comin’
2336,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"on in years, and gittin’ such a fine start, and all, and position and"
2337,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"everythink.—Yes-sir! _position_, ’cause everybody likes you, Tudens. You"
2338,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"know that; and I’m that proud of you and all, and that selfish, that"
2339,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"it’s onpossible I could ever, ever give you up;—never, never, _ever_ give"
2340,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,you up!” And Mr. Twiggs again stifled his voice in his handkerchief and
2341,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,blew his nose with prolonged violence.
2342,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2343,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"It may have been the melancholy ticking of the clock, as it grated on the"
2344,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"silence following, it may have been the gathering darkness of the room,"
2345,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"or the plaintive sighing of the rising wind without, that caused the girl"
2346,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,to shudder as she stooped to kiss the kind old face bent forward in the
2347,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"shadows, and turned with feigned gayety to the simple task of arranging"
2348,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"supper. But when, a few minutes later, she announced that Twiggs and"
2349,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"Tudens’s tea was waiting, the two smilingly sat down, Mr. Twiggs"
2350,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"remarking that if he only knew a blessing, he’d ask it upon that occasion"
2351,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,most certainly.
2352,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2353,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“—For on’y look at these-’ere ’am and eggs,” he said, admiringly: “I’d"
2354,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"like to know if the Queen herself could cook ’em to a nicer turn, or"
2355,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"serve ’em up more tantaliz’in’er to the palate. And this-’ere soup,—or"
2356,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"whatever it is, is rich as gravy; and these boughten rolls ain’t a bad"
2357,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"thing either, split in two and toasted as you do ’em, air they, Tude?”"
2358,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"And as Mr. Twiggs glanced inquiringly at his companion, he found her"
2359,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"staring vacantly at her plate. “I was jest a-sayin’, Tudens—” he went on,"
2360,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,pretending to blow his tea and glancing cautiously across his saucer.
2361,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2362,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Yes, Pop’m, I heard you;—we really _ought_ to have a blessing, by all"
2363,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,means.”
2364,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2365,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"Mr. Twiggs put down his tea without tasting it. “Tudens,” he said, after"
2366,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"a long pause, in which he carefully buttered a piece of toast for the"
2367,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"second time,—“Tudens, I’m ’most afeard you didn’t grasp that last remark"
2368,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,of mine: I was a-sayin’—”
2369,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2370,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Well—” said Tudens, attentively."
2371,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2372,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“I was a-sayin’,” said Mr. Twiggs, averting his face and staring"
2373,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,stoically at his toast—“I was a-sayin’ that you was a-gittin’ now to be
2374,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,quite a young woman.”
2375,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2376,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Oh, so you were,” said Tudens, with charming naïveté."
2377,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2378,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Well,” said Mr. Twiggs, repentantly, but with a humorous twinkle, “if I"
2379,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"wasn’t a-sayin’ of it, I was _a-thinkin’_ it.”—And then, running along"
2380,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"hurriedly, “And I’ve been a-thinkin’ it for days and days—ever sence"
2381,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"you left the ‘balley’ and went in ‘chambermaids,’ and last in leadin’"
2382,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"rôles. Maybe _you_ ain’t noticed it, but I’ve had my eyes on you from the"
2383,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"‘flies’ and the ‘wings’; and jest betwixt us, Tudens, and not for me as"
2384,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"ort to know better, and does know better, to go a-flatterin’, at my time"
2385,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"o’—or to go a-flatterin’ anybody, as I said, after you’re a-gittin’ to"
2386,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"be a young woman—and what’s more, a werry _’andsome_ young woman!”"
2387,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2388,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“_Why, Pop’m!_” exclaimed Tudens, blushing."
2389,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2390,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Yes, you are, Tudens, and I mean it, every word of it; and as I was"
2391,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"a-goin’ on to say, I’ve been a-watchin’ of you, and a-layin’ off a long"
2392,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,time jest to tell you summat that will make your eyes open wider ’an
2393,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"that! What I mean,” said Mr. Twiggs, coughing vehemently and pushing his"
2394,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"chair back from the table—“what I mean is, you’ll soon be old enough to"
2395,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"be a-settin’ up for yourself-like, and a-marry’—W’y, Tudens, what _ails_"
2396,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"you?” The girl had risen to her feet, and, with a face dead white and"
2397,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"lips all tremulous, stood clinging to her chair for support. “What ails"
2398,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"you, Tudens?” repeated Mr. Twiggs, rising to his feet and gazing on her"
2399,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,with a curious expression of alarm and tenderness.
2400,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2401,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Nothing serious, dear Pop’m,” said Tudens, with a flighty little"
2402,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"laugh,—“only it just flashed on me all at once that I’d clean forgotten"
2403,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"poor ‘Dick’s’ supper.” And as she turned abruptly to the parrot, cooing"
2404,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"and clucking to him playfully,—up, up from some hitherto undreamed-of"
2405,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,depth within the yearning heart of Mr. Twiggs mutely welled the old
2406,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"utterance, “Tude’s a queer girl!”"
2407,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2408,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Whatever made you think of such a thing, Father?” called Tudens,"
2409,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"gayly; and then, without waiting for an answer, went on cooing to the"
2410,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"parrot,—“Hey, old dicky-bird! do _you_ think Tudens is a handsome young"
2411,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"woman? and do _you_ think Tudens is old enough to marry, eh?” This query"
2412,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"delivered, she broke into a fit of merriment which so wrought upon the"
2413,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,susceptibilities of the bird that he was heard repeatedly to declare and
2414,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"affirm, in most positive and unequivocal terms, that Tude had actually"
2415,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,come home.
2416,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2417,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Yes—_sir_, Tudens!” broke in Mr. Twiggs at last, lighting a fresh"
2418,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,churchwarden and settling into his old position at the grate; “have your
2419,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"laugh out over it now, but it’s a werry serious fact, for all that.”"
2420,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2421,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“I know it, Father,” said the girl, recovering her gravity, turning her"
2422,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"large eyes lovingly upon him and speaking very tenderly. “I know it—oh, I"
2423,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"know it; and many, many times when I have thought of it, and then again"
2424,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,of your old kindly faith; all the warm wealth of your love; and our old
2425,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"home here, and all the happiness it ever held for me and you alike—oh, I"
2426,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"have tried hard—indeed, indeed I have—to put all other thought away and"
2427,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"live for you alone! But, Pop’m! dear old Pop’m—”And even as the great"
2428,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"strong breast made shelter for her own, the woman’s heart within her"
2429,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,flowed away in mists of gracious tears.
2430,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2431,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Couldn’t live without old Pop’m, could her?” half cried and laughed"
2432,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"the happy Mr. Twiggs, tangling his clumsy fingers in the long dark hair"
2433,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"that fell across his arm, and bending till his glad face touched her"
2434,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,own.—“Couldn’t live without old Pop’m?”
2435,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2436,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Never! never!” sobbed the girl, lifting her brimming eyes and"
2437,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"gazing in the kind old face. “Oh, may I always live with you, Pop’m?"
2438,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,Always?—Forever?—”
2439,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2440,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“—And a day!” said Mr. Twiggs, emphatically."
2441,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2442,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,“Even after I’m—” and she hid her face again.
2443,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2444,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Even after—_what_, Tudens?”"
2445,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2446,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“After I’m—after I’m—married?” murmured Tudens, with a longing pressure."
2447,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2448,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Nothink short!” said Mr. Twiggs;—“perwidin’,” he added, releasing one"
2449,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"hand and smoothing back his scanty hair—“perwidin’, of course, that your"
2450,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"man is a’ honest, straitforrerd feller, as ain’t no lordly notions nor"
2451,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,nothink o’ that sort.”
2452,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2453,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,“Nor rich?”
2454,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2455,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Well, I ain’t so p’ticklar about his bein’ _pore_, adzackly.—Say a"
2456,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"feller as works for his livin’, and knows how to ’usband his earnin’s"
2457,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"thrifty-like, and allus ’as a hextry crown or two laid up against a rainy"
2458,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"day—and a good perwider, of course,” said Mr. Twiggs, with a comfortable"
2459,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,glance around the room.—“’Ll blow me if I didn’t see a face there
2460,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,a-peerin’ in the winder!”
2461,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2462,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Oh, no, you didn’t,” said the girl, without raising her head. “Go"
2463,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,on—‘and a good provider—’”
2464,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2465,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“—A good perwider,” continued Mr. Twiggs; “and a feller, of course, as"
2466,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"has a’ eye out for the substantials of this life, and ain’t afeard o’"
2467,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"work—that’s the idear! that’s the idear!” said Mr. Twiggs, by way of"
2468,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,sweeping conclusion.
2469,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2470,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“And that’s all old Pop’m asks, after all?” queried the girl, with her"
2471,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,radiant face wistful as his own.
2472,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2473,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“W’y, certainly!” said Mr. Twiggs, with heartiness. “Ain’t that all and"
2474,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,everythink to make home happy?”—catching her face between his great brown
2475,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,hands and kissing her triumphantly.
2476,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2477,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Hooray for Twiggs-and Twiggs-and Twiggs-and—” cootered the drowsy bird,"
2478,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,disjointedly.
2479,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2480,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,The girl had risen.—“And you’ll forgive me for marrying such a man?”
2481,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2482,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“Won’t I?” said Mr. Twiggs, with a rapturous twinkle."
2483,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2484,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"As he spoke, she flung her arms about his neck and pressed her lips"
2485,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"close, close against his cheek, her own glad face now fronting the little"
2486,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"window.... She heard the clicking of the latch, the opening of the door,"
2487,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,and the step of the intruder ere she loosed her hold.
2488,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2489,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"“God bless you, Pop’m, and forgive me!—This is my husband.”"
2490,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,
2491,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"The newcomer, Mr. Stanley, reached and grasped the hand of Mr. Twiggs,"
2492,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"eagerly, fervidly, albeit the face he looked on then will haunt him to"
2493,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"the hour of his death.—Yet haply, some day, when the Master takes the"
2494,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,"selfsame hand within his own and whispers, “Tude’s come home,” the old"
2495,TWIGGS AND TUDENS,smile will return.

2635,ORLIE WILDE,"A goddess, with a siren’s grace,—"
2636,ORLIE WILDE,A sun-haired girl on a craggy place
2637,ORLIE WILDE,Above a bay where fish-boats lay
2638,ORLIE WILDE,Drifting about like birds of prey.
2639,ORLIE WILDE,
2640,ORLIE WILDE,"Wrought was she of a painter’s dream,—"
2641,ORLIE WILDE,"Wise only as are artists wise,"
2642,ORLIE WILDE,"My artist-friend, Rolf Herschkelhiem,"
2643,ORLIE WILDE,"With deep sad eyes of oversize,"
2644,ORLIE WILDE,And face of melancholy guise.
2645,ORLIE WILDE,
2646,ORLIE WILDE,I pressed him that he tell to me
2647,ORLIE WILDE,This masterpiece’s history.
2648,ORLIE WILDE,He turned—_re_turned—and thus beguiled
2649,ORLIE WILDE,Me with the tale of Orlie Wilde:—
2650,ORLIE WILDE,
2651,ORLIE WILDE,“We artists live ideally:
2652,ORLIE WILDE,We breed our firmest facts of air;
2653,ORLIE WILDE,We make our own reality—
2654,ORLIE WILDE,We dream a thing and it is so.
2655,ORLIE WILDE,The fairest scenes we ever see
2656,ORLIE WILDE,Are mirages of memory;
2657,ORLIE WILDE,The sweetest thoughts we ever know
2658,ORLIE WILDE,We plagiarize from Long Ago:
2659,ORLIE WILDE,And as the girl on canvas there
2660,ORLIE WILDE,"Is marvellously rare and fair,"
2661,ORLIE WILDE,’Tis only inasmuch as she
2662,ORLIE WILDE,Is dumb and may not speak to me!”
2663,ORLIE WILDE,He tapped me with his mahlstick—then
2664,ORLIE WILDE,"The picture,—and went on again:"
2665,ORLIE WILDE,
2666,ORLIE WILDE,"“Orlie Wilde, the fisher’s child—"
2667,ORLIE WILDE,"I see her yet, as fair and mild"
2668,ORLIE WILDE,As ever nursling summer day
2669,ORLIE WILDE,Dreamed on the bosom of the bay:
2670,ORLIE WILDE,"For I was twenty then, and went"
2671,ORLIE WILDE,Alone and long-haired—all content
2672,ORLIE WILDE,With promises of sounding name
2673,ORLIE WILDE,"And fantasies of future fame,"
2674,ORLIE WILDE,And thoughts that now my mind discards
2675,ORLIE WILDE,As editor a fledgling bard’s.
2676,ORLIE WILDE,
2677,ORLIE WILDE,"“At evening once I chanced to go,"
2678,ORLIE WILDE,"With pencil and portfolio,"
2679,ORLIE WILDE,Adown the street of silver sand
2680,ORLIE WILDE,"That winds beneath this craggy land,"
2681,ORLIE WILDE,To make a sketch of some old scurf
2682,ORLIE WILDE,"Of driftage, nosing through the surf"
2683,ORLIE WILDE,"A splintered mast, with knarl and strand"
2684,ORLIE WILDE,Of rigging-rope and tattered threads
2685,ORLIE WILDE,Of flag and streamer and of sail
2686,ORLIE WILDE,That fluttered idly in the gale
2687,ORLIE WILDE,Or whipped themselves to sadder shreds.
2688,ORLIE WILDE,"The while I wrought, half listlessly,"
2689,ORLIE WILDE,"On my dismantled subject, came"
2690,ORLIE WILDE,"A sea-bird, settling on the same"
2691,ORLIE WILDE,"With plaintive moan, as though that he"
2692,ORLIE WILDE,Had lost his mate upon the sea;
2693,ORLIE WILDE,And—with my melancholy trend—
2694,ORLIE WILDE,It brought dim dreams half understood—
2695,ORLIE WILDE,"It wrought upon my morbid mood,—"
2696,ORLIE WILDE,I thought of my own voyagings
2697,ORLIE WILDE,That had no end—that have no end.—
2698,ORLIE WILDE,"And, like the sea-bird, I made moan"
2699,ORLIE WILDE,That I was loveless and alone.
2700,ORLIE WILDE,And when at last with weary wings
2701,ORLIE WILDE,"It went upon its wanderings,"
2702,ORLIE WILDE,With upturned face I watched its flight
2703,ORLIE WILDE,Until this picture met my sight:
2704,ORLIE WILDE,"A goddess, with a siren’s grace,—"
2705,ORLIE WILDE,A sun-haired girl on a craggy place
2706,ORLIE WILDE,Above a bay where fish-boats lay
2707,ORLIE WILDE,Drifting about like birds of prey.
2708,ORLIE WILDE,
2709,ORLIE WILDE,"“In airy poise she, gazing, stood"
2710,ORLIE WILDE,"A matchless form of womanhood,"
2711,ORLIE WILDE,That brought a thought that if for me
2712,ORLIE WILDE,"Such eyes had sought across the sea,"
2713,ORLIE WILDE,I could have swum the widest tide
2714,ORLIE WILDE,"That ever mariner defied,"
2715,ORLIE WILDE,"And, at the shore, could on have gone"
2716,ORLIE WILDE,"To that high crag she stood upon,"
2717,ORLIE WILDE,"To there entreat and say, ‘My Sweet,"
2718,ORLIE WILDE,Behold thy servant at thy feet.’
2719,ORLIE WILDE,"And to my soul I said: ‘Above,"
2720,ORLIE WILDE,There stands the idol of thy love!’
2721,ORLIE WILDE,
2722,ORLIE WILDE,"“In this rapt, awed, ecstatic state"
2723,ORLIE WILDE,I gazed—till lo! I was aware
2724,ORLIE WILDE,A fisherman had joined her there—
2725,ORLIE WILDE,"A weary man, with halting gait,"
2726,ORLIE WILDE,Who toiled beneath a basket’s weight:
2727,ORLIE WILDE,"Her father, as I guessed, for she"
2728,ORLIE WILDE,Had run to meet him gleefully
2729,ORLIE WILDE,"And ta’en his burden to herself,"
2730,ORLIE WILDE,That perched upon her shoulder’s shelf
2731,ORLIE WILDE,"So lightly that she, tripping, neared"
2732,ORLIE WILDE,A jutting crag and disappeared;
2733,ORLIE WILDE,But left the echo of a song
2734,ORLIE WILDE,"That thrills me yet, and will as long"
2735,ORLIE WILDE,As I have being!...
2736,ORLIE WILDE,
2737,ORLIE WILDE,... “Evenings came
2738,ORLIE WILDE,"And went,—but each the same—the same:"
2739,ORLIE WILDE,"She watched above, and even so"
2740,ORLIE WILDE,I stood there watching from below;
2741,ORLIE WILDE,"Till, grown so bold at last, I sung,—"
2742,ORLIE WILDE,(What matter now the theme thereof!)—
2743,ORLIE WILDE,It brought an answer from her tongue—
2744,ORLIE WILDE,"Faint as the murmur of a dove,"
2745,ORLIE WILDE,Yet all the more the song of love....
2746,ORLIE WILDE,
2747,ORLIE WILDE,"“I turned and looked upon the bay,"
2748,ORLIE WILDE,With palm to forehead—eyes a-blur
2749,ORLIE WILDE,In the sea’s smile—meant but for her!—
2750,ORLIE WILDE,I saw the fish-boats far away
2751,ORLIE WILDE,"In misty distance, lightly drawn"
2752,ORLIE WILDE,In chalk-dots on the horizon—
2753,ORLIE WILDE,"Looked back at her, long, wistfully,—"
2754,ORLIE WILDE,"And, pushing off an empty skiff,"
2755,ORLIE WILDE,I beckoned her to quit the cliff
2756,ORLIE WILDE,And yield me her rare company
2757,ORLIE WILDE,Upon a little pleasure-cruise.—
2758,ORLIE WILDE,"She stood, as loathful to refuse,"
2759,ORLIE WILDE,"To muse for full a moment’s time,—"
2760,ORLIE WILDE,Then answered back in pantomime
2761,ORLIE WILDE,‘She feared some danger from the sea
2762,ORLIE WILDE,Were she discovered thus with me.’
2763,ORLIE WILDE,I motioned then to ask her if
2764,ORLIE WILDE,I might not join her on the cliff;
2765,ORLIE WILDE,"And back again, with graceful wave"
2766,ORLIE WILDE,"Of lifted arm, she answer gave"
2767,ORLIE WILDE,‘She feared some danger from the sea.’
2768,ORLIE WILDE,
2769,ORLIE WILDE,"“Impatient, piqued, impetuous, I"
2770,ORLIE WILDE,"Sprang in the boat, and flung ‘Good-bye’"
2771,ORLIE WILDE,"From pouted mouth with angry hand,"
2772,ORLIE WILDE,And madly pulled away from land
2773,ORLIE WILDE,"With lusty stroke, despite that she"
2774,ORLIE WILDE,Held out her hands entreatingly:
2775,ORLIE WILDE,"And when far out, with covert eye"
2776,ORLIE WILDE,"I shoreward glanced, I saw her fly"
2777,ORLIE WILDE,"In reckless haste adown the crag,"
2778,ORLIE WILDE,Her hair a-flutter like a flag
2779,ORLIE WILDE,Of gold that danced across the strand
2780,ORLIE WILDE,In little mists of silver sand.
2781,ORLIE WILDE,"All curious I, pausing, tried"
2782,ORLIE WILDE,"To fancy what it all implied,—"
2783,ORLIE WILDE,When suddenly I found my feet
2784,ORLIE WILDE,"Were wet; and, underneath the seat"
2785,ORLIE WILDE,"On which I sat, I heard the sound"
2786,ORLIE WILDE,"Of gurgling waters, and I found"
2787,ORLIE WILDE,The boat aleak alarmingly....
2788,ORLIE WILDE,"I turned and looked upon the sea,"
2789,ORLIE WILDE,Whose every wave seemed mocking me;
2790,ORLIE WILDE,I saw the fishers’ sails once more—
2791,ORLIE WILDE,In dimmer distance than before;
2792,ORLIE WILDE,"I saw the sea-bird wheeling by,"
2793,ORLIE WILDE,With foolish wish that _I_ could fly:
2794,ORLIE WILDE,"I thought of firm earth, home and friends—"
2795,ORLIE WILDE,I thought of everything that tends
2796,ORLIE WILDE,To drive a man to frenzy and
2797,ORLIE WILDE,To wholly lose his own command;
2798,ORLIE WILDE,I thought of all my waywardness—
2799,ORLIE WILDE,Thought of a mother’s deep distress;
2800,ORLIE WILDE,Of youthful follies yet unpurged—
2801,ORLIE WILDE,"Sins, as the seas, about me surged—"
2802,ORLIE WILDE,Thought of the printer’s ready pen
2803,ORLIE WILDE,To-morrow drowning me again;—
2804,ORLIE WILDE,A million things without a name—
2805,ORLIE WILDE,I thought of everything but—Fame....
2806,ORLIE WILDE,
2807,ORLIE WILDE,"“A memory yet is in my mind,"
2808,ORLIE WILDE,"So keenly clear and sharp-defined,"
2809,ORLIE WILDE,I picture every phase and line
2810,ORLIE WILDE,"Of life and death, and neither mine,—"
2811,ORLIE WILDE,"While some fair seraph, golden-haired,"
2812,ORLIE WILDE,"Bends over me,—with white arms bared,"
2813,ORLIE WILDE,That strongly plait themselves about
2814,ORLIE WILDE,My drowning weight and lift me out—
2815,ORLIE WILDE,With joy too great for words to state
2816,ORLIE WILDE,Or tongue to dare articulate!
2817,ORLIE WILDE,
2818,ORLIE WILDE,“And this seraphic ocean-child
2819,ORLIE WILDE,And heroine was Orlie Wilde:
2820,ORLIE WILDE,And thus it was I came to hear
2821,ORLIE WILDE,Her voice’s music in my ear—
2822,ORLIE WILDE,"Ay, thus it was Fate paved the way"
2823,ORLIE WILDE,That I walk desolate to-day!” ...
2824,ORLIE WILDE,
2825,ORLIE WILDE,The artist paused and bowed his face
2826,ORLIE WILDE,"Within his palms a little space,"
2827,ORLIE WILDE,While reverently on his form
2828,ORLIE WILDE,I bent my gaze and marked a storm
2829,ORLIE WILDE,That shook his frame as wrathfully
2830,ORLIE WILDE,"As some typhoon of agony,"
2831,ORLIE WILDE,And fraught with sobs—the more profound
2832,ORLIE WILDE,For that peculiar laughing sound
2833,ORLIE WILDE,We hear when strong men weep.... I leant
2834,ORLIE WILDE,With warmest sympathy—I bent
2835,ORLIE WILDE,"To stroke with soothing hand his brow,"
2836,ORLIE WILDE,He murmuring—“’Tis over now!—
2837,ORLIE WILDE,And shall I tie the silken thread
2838,ORLIE WILDE,"Of my frail romance?” “Yes,” I said.—"
2839,ORLIE WILDE,"He faintly smiled; and then, with brow"
2840,ORLIE WILDE,"In kneading palm, as one in dread—"
2841,ORLIE WILDE,His tasselled cap pushed from his head;—
2842,ORLIE WILDE,"“‘Her voice’s music,’ I repeat,”"
2843,ORLIE WILDE,"He said,—“’twas sweet—O passing sweet!—"
2844,ORLIE WILDE,"Though she herself, in uttering"
2845,ORLIE WILDE,"Its melody, proved not the thing"
2846,ORLIE WILDE,Of loveliness my dreams made meet
2847,ORLIE WILDE,"For me—there, yearning, at her feet—"
2848,ORLIE WILDE,"Prone at her feet—a worshipper,—"
2849,ORLIE WILDE,"For lo! she spake a tongue,” moaned he,"
2850,ORLIE WILDE,“Unknown to me;—unknown to me
2851,ORLIE WILDE,As mine to her—as mine to her.”

2860,LEONAINIE,And they took the light
2861,LEONAINIE,Of the laughing stars and framed her
2862,LEONAINIE,In a smile of white;
2863,LEONAINIE,And they made her hair of gloomy
2864,LEONAINIE,"Midnight, and her eyes of bloomy"
2865,LEONAINIE,"Moonshine, and they brought her to me"
2866,LEONAINIE,In the solemn night.—
2867,LEONAINIE,
2868,LEONAINIE,"In a solemn night of summer,"
2869,LEONAINIE,When my heart of gloom
2870,LEONAINIE,Blossomed up to greet the comer
2871,LEONAINIE,Like a rose in bloom;
2872,LEONAINIE,All forebodings that distressed me
2873,LEONAINIE,I forgot as Joy caressed me—
2874,LEONAINIE,(_Lying_ Joy! that caught and pressed me
2875,LEONAINIE,In the arms of doom!)
2876,LEONAINIE,
2877,LEONAINIE,Only spake the little lisper
2878,LEONAINIE,In the Angel-tongue;
2879,LEONAINIE,"Yet I, listening, heard her whisper,—"
2880,LEONAINIE,“Songs are only sung
2881,LEONAINIE,Here below that they may grieve you—
2882,LEONAINIE,"Tales but told you to deceive you,—"
2883,LEONAINIE,So must Leonainie leave you
2884,LEONAINIE,While her love is young.”
2885,LEONAINIE,
2886,LEONAINIE,Then God smiled and it was morning.
2887,LEONAINIE,Matchless and supreme
2888,LEONAINIE,Heaven’s glory seemed adorning

2944,THE VOICES,
2945,THE VOICES,They call to me from the darkness;
2946,THE VOICES,"They cry to me from the gloom,"
2947,THE VOICES,Till I start sometimes from my pillow

2951,THE VOICES,"Wears a pallor like my own,"

2955,THE VOICES,"The low, mysterious clamor"
2956,THE VOICES,Of voices that seem to be
2957,THE VOICES,Striving in vain to whisper
2958,THE VOICES,Of secret things to me;—
2959,THE VOICES,
2960,THE VOICES,Of a something dread to be warned of;
2961,THE VOICES,Of a rapture yet withheld;
2962,THE VOICES,Or hints of the marvellous beauty
2963,THE VOICES,Of songs unsyllabled.
2964,THE VOICES,
2965,THE VOICES,But ever and ever the meaning
2966,THE VOICES,"Falters and fails and dies,"

3124,THE CIRCUS PARADE,"The clash and the clang of the cymbals that beat,"
3125,THE CIRCUS PARADE,As the glittering pageant winds down the long street!
3126,THE CIRCUS PARADE,
3127,THE CIRCUS PARADE,In the Circus parade there is glory clean down
3128,THE CIRCUS PARADE,"From the first spangled horse to the mule of the Clown,"
3129,THE CIRCUS PARADE,With the gleam and the glint and the glamour and glare
3130,THE CIRCUS PARADE,Of the days of enchantment all glimmering there!
3131,THE CIRCUS PARADE,
3132,THE CIRCUS PARADE,And there are the banners of silvery fold
3133,THE CIRCUS PARADE,"Caressing the winds with their fringes of gold,"
3134,THE CIRCUS PARADE,"And their high-lifted standards, with spear-tips aglow,"
3135,THE CIRCUS PARADE,And the helmeted knights that go riding below.
3136,THE CIRCUS PARADE,
3137,THE CIRCUS PARADE,"There’s the Chariot, wrought of some marvellous shell"
3138,THE CIRCUS PARADE,"The Sea gave to Neptune, first washing it well"
3139,THE CIRCUS PARADE,"With its fabulous waters of gold, till it gleams"
3140,THE CIRCUS PARADE,Like the galleon rare of an Argonaut’s dreams.
3141,THE CIRCUS PARADE,
3142,THE CIRCUS PARADE,"And the Elephant, too, (with his undulant stride"

3150,THE CIRCUS PARADE,Where the close-hidden animals’ noses appear.
3151,THE CIRCUS PARADE,
3152,THE CIRCUS PARADE,"Here’s the Pyramid-car, with its splendor and flash,"
3153,THE CIRCUS PARADE,"And the Goddess on high, in a hot-scarlet sash"
3154,THE CIRCUS PARADE,And a pen-wiper skirt!—O the rarest of sights
3155,THE CIRCUS PARADE,Is this “Queen of the Air” in cerulean tights!
3156,THE CIRCUS PARADE,
3157,THE CIRCUS PARADE,"Then the far-away clash of the cymbals, and then"
3158,THE CIRCUS PARADE,The swoon of the tune ere it wakens again
3159,THE CIRCUS PARADE,With the capering tones of the gallant cornet
3160,THE CIRCUS PARADE,That go dancing away in a mad minuet.
3161,THE CIRCUS PARADE,

3196,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,
3197,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,O there were three jolly hunters;
3198,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"And a-hunting they did go,"
3199,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"With a spaniel-dog, and a pointer-dog,"
3200,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,And a setter-dog also.
3201,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,Looky there!
3202,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,
3203,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,And they hunted and they hal-looed;
3204,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,And the first thing they did find
3205,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,Was a dingling-dangling hornet’s-nest
3206,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,A-swinging in the wind.
3207,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,Looky there!
3208,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,
3209,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,And the first one said—“What is it?”
3210,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"Said the next, “We’ll punch and see”:"
3211,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"And the next one said, a mile from there,"
3212,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,“I wish we’d let it be!”
3213,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,Looky there!
3214,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,
3215,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,And they hunted and they hal-looed;
3216,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,And the next thing they did raise
3217,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,Was a bobbin’ bunny cottontail
3218,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,That vanished from their gaze.
3219,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,Looky there!
3220,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,
3221,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"One said it was a hot base-ball,"
3222,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"Zipped through the brambly thatch,"
3223,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"But the others said ’twas a note by post,"
3224,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,Or a telegraph-dispatch.
3225,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,Looky there!
3226,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,
3227,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,So they hunted and they hal-looed;
3228,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,And the next thing they did sight
3229,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"Was a great big bulldog chasing them,"
3230,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"And a farmer, hollerin’ “Skite!”"
3231,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,Looky there!
3232,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,
3233,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"And the first one said, “Hi-jinktum!”"
3234,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"And the next, “Hi-jinktum-jee!”"
3235,THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS,"And the last one said, “Them very words"

3248,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,His two puppy-children
3249,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,"Locked in there, he curled"
3250,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,"Up his tail in pink bombazine netting,"
3251,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,And set out

3254,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,
3255,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,"He walked to Chicago,"

3258,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,"In fact, he discovered"
3259,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,That many folks there
3260,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,"Thought less of Chicago than ever,"
3261,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,As he musing-

3263,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,The World.
3264,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,
3265,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,"He walked on to Boston,"
3266,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,"And round Bunker Hill,"
3267,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,"Bow-wowed, but no citizen heerd him—"
3268,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,Till he ordered his baggage
3269,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,"And called for his bill,"
3270,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,"And then, bless their souls! how they cheered him,"
3271,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,As he gladly

3273,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,The World.
3274,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,
3275,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,He walked and walked on
3276,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,For a year and a day—
3277,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,"Dropped down at his own door and panted,"
3278,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,Till a teamster came driving
3279,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,Along the highway
3280,THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY,And told him that house there was ha’nted
