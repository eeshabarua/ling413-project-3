20,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,The Standard Library Edition of Mr. Whittier's  writings comprises his
21,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,poetical and prose works as re-arranged and thoroughly revised by
22,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,himself or with his cooperation.  Mr. Whittier has supplied  such
23,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,additional information regarding the subject and occasion of certain
24,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"poems as may be stated in brief head-notes, and this edition has been"
25,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,much enriched by the poet's personal comment. So far as practicable the
26,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"dates of publication of the various articles have been given, and since"
27,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"these were  originally published soon after composition, the dates of"
28,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,their first appearance have been taken as  determining the time at which
29,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"they were written. At the request of the Publishers, Mr. Whittier  has"
30,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"allowed his early poems, discarded from previous collections, to be"
31,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"placed, in the general order  of their appearance, in an appendix to the"
32,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,final volume of poems. By this means the present edition is made so
33,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,complete and retrospective that students of the poet's career will
34,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,always find the most abundant material for their purpose. The Publishers
35,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,congratulate themselves and the public that the careful attention which
36,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,Mr. Whittier has been able to give to this revision of his works has
37,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,resulted in so comprehensive and well-adjusted a collection.
38,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,
39,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,The portraits prefixed to the several volumes have been chosen with a
40,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,view to illustrating successive periods in the poet's life.  The
41,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,original sources and dates are indicated in each case.

216,INTRODUCTION,
217,INTRODUCTION,The edition of my poems published in 1857 contained the following note
218,INTRODUCTION,by way of preface:--
219,INTRODUCTION,
220,INTRODUCTION,"""In these volumes, for the first time, a complete collection of my"
221,INTRODUCTION,poetical writings has been made. While it is satisfactory to know that
222,INTRODUCTION,"these scattered children of my brain have found a home, I cannot but"
223,INTRODUCTION,"regret that I have been unable, by reason of illness, to give that"
224,INTRODUCTION,"attention to their revision and arrangement, which respect for the"
225,INTRODUCTION,opinions of others and my own afterthought and experience demand.
226,INTRODUCTION,
227,INTRODUCTION,"""That there are pieces in this collection which I would 'willingly let"
228,INTRODUCTION,"die,' I am free to confess. But it is now too late to disown them, and I"
229,INTRODUCTION,must submit to the inevitable penalty of poetical as well as other sins.
230,INTRODUCTION,"There are others, intimately connected with the author's life and times,"
231,INTRODUCTION,which owe their tenacity of vitality to the circumstances under which
232,INTRODUCTION,"they were written, and the events by which they were suggested."
233,INTRODUCTION,
234,INTRODUCTION,"""The long poem of Mogg Megone was in a great measure composed in early"
235,INTRODUCTION,life; and it is scarcely necessary to say that its subject is not such
236,INTRODUCTION,"as the writer would have chosen at any subsequent period."""
237,INTRODUCTION,
238,INTRODUCTION,"After a lapse of thirty years since the above was written, I have been"
239,INTRODUCTION,requested by my publishers to make some preparation for a new and
240,INTRODUCTION,revised edition of my poems. I cannot flatter myself that I have added
241,INTRODUCTION,much to the interest of the work beyond the correction of my own errors
242,INTRODUCTION,"and those of the press, with the addition of a few heretofore"
243,INTRODUCTION,"unpublished pieces, and occasional notes of explanation which seemed"
244,INTRODUCTION,necessary. I have made an attempt to classify the poems under a few
245,INTRODUCTION,"general heads, and have transferred the long poem of Mogg Megone to the"
246,INTRODUCTION,"Appendix, with other specimens of my earlier writings. I have endeavored"
247,INTRODUCTION,to affix the dates of composition or publication as far as possible.
248,INTRODUCTION,
249,INTRODUCTION,In looking over these poems I have not been unmindful of occasional
250,INTRODUCTION,"prosaic lines and verbal infelicities, but at this late day I have"
251,INTRODUCTION,neither strength nor patience to undertake their correction.
252,INTRODUCTION,
253,INTRODUCTION,Perhaps a word of explanation may be needed in regard to a class of
254,INTRODUCTION,poems written between the years 1832 and 1865. Of their defects from an
255,INTRODUCTION,artistic point of view it is not necessary to speak. They were the
256,INTRODUCTION,earnest and often vehement expression of the writer's thought and
257,INTRODUCTION,feeling at critical periods in the great conflict between Freedom and
258,INTRODUCTION,Slavery. They were written with no expectation that they would survive
259,INTRODUCTION,"the occasions which called them forth: they were protests, alarm"
260,INTRODUCTION,"signals, trumpet-calls to action, words wrung from the writer's heart,"
261,INTRODUCTION,"forged at white heat, and of course lacking the finish and careful"
262,INTRODUCTION,word-selection which reflection and patient brooding over them might
263,INTRODUCTION,"have given. Such as they are, they belong to the history of the"
264,INTRODUCTION,"Anti-Slavery movement, and may serve as way-marks of its progress. If"
265,INTRODUCTION,"their language at times seems severe and harsh, the monstrous wrong of"
266,INTRODUCTION,"Slavery which provoked it must be its excuse, if any is needed. In"
267,INTRODUCTION,"attacking it, we did not measure our words. ""It is,"" said Garrison,"
268,INTRODUCTION,"""a waste of politeness to be courteous to the devil."" But in truth the"
269,INTRODUCTION,"contest was, in a great measure, an impersonal one,--hatred of slavery"
270,INTRODUCTION,and not of slave-masters.
271,INTRODUCTION,
272,INTRODUCTION,"""No common wrong provoked our zeal,"
273,INTRODUCTION,The silken gauntlet which is thrown
274,INTRODUCTION,"In such a quarrel rings like steel."""
275,INTRODUCTION,
276,INTRODUCTION,"Even Thomas Jefferson, in his terrible denunciation of Slavery in the"
277,INTRODUCTION,"Notes on Virginia, says ""It is impossible to be temperate and pursue the"
278,INTRODUCTION,"subject of Slavery."" After the great contest was over, no class of the"
279,INTRODUCTION,"American people were more ready, with kind words and deprecation of"
280,INTRODUCTION,"harsh retaliation, to welcome back the revolted States than the"
281,INTRODUCTION,Abolitionists; and none have since more heartily rejoiced at the fast
282,INTRODUCTION,increasing prosperity of the South.
283,INTRODUCTION,
284,INTRODUCTION,Grateful for the measure of favor which has been accorded to my
285,INTRODUCTION,"writings, I leave this edition with the public. It contains all that I"
286,INTRODUCTION,"care to re-publish, and some things which, had the matter of choice been"
287,INTRODUCTION,"left solely to myself, I should have omitted."

300,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
301,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,This poem was suggested by the account given of the manner which the
302,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,Waldenses disseminated their principles among the Catholic gentry. They
303,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,gained access to the house through their occupation as peddlers of
304,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"silks, jewels, and trinkets. ""Having disposed of some of their goods,"""
305,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"it is said by a writer who quotes the inquisitor Rainerus Sacco, ""they"
306,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,cautiously intimated that they had commodities far more valuable than
307,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"these, inestimable jewels, which they would show if they could be"
308,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,protected from the clergy. They would then give their purchasers a Bible
309,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"or Testament; and thereby many were deluded into heresy."" The poem,"
310,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"under the title Le Colporteur Vaudois, was translated into French by"
311,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Professor G. de Felice, of Montauban, and further naturalized by"
312,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Professor Alexandre Rodolphe Vinet, who quoted it in his lectures on"
313,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"French literature, afterwards published. It became familiar in this form"
314,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"to the Waldenses, who adopted it as a household poem. An American"
315,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"clergyman, J. C. Fletcher, frequently heard it when he was a student,"
316,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"about the year 1850, in the theological seminary at Geneva, Switzerland,"
317,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,but the authorship of the poem was unknown to those who used it.
318,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Twenty-five years later, Mr. Fletcher, learning the name of the author,"
319,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"wrote to the moderator of the Waldensian synod at La Tour, giving the"
320,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"information. At the banquet which closed the meeting of the synod, the"
321,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"moderator announced the fact, and was instructed in the name of the"
322,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Waldensian church to write to me a letter of thanks. My letter, written"
323,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"in reply, was translated into Italian and printed throughout Italy."
324,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
325,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"""O LADY fair, these silks of mine"
326,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"are beautiful and rare,--"
327,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"The richest web of the Indian loom, which beauty's"
328,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,queen might wear;
329,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"And my pearls are pure as thy own fair neck, with whose"
330,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,radiant light they vie;
331,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"I have brought them with me a weary way,--will my"
332,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"gentle lady buy?"""
333,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
334,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,The lady smiled on the worn old man through the
335,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,dark and clustering curls
336,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Which veiled her brow, as she bent to view his"
337,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,silks and glittering pearls;
338,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,And she placed their price in the old man's hand
339,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"and lightly turned away,"
340,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"But she paused at the wanderer's earnest call,--"
341,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"""My gentle lady, stay!"
342,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
343,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"""O lady fair, I have yet a gem which a purer"
344,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"lustre flings,"
345,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,Than the diamond flash of the jewelled crown on
346,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,the lofty brow of kings;
347,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"A wonderful pearl of exceeding price, whose virtue"
348,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"shall not decay,"
349,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,Whose light shall be as a spell to thee and a
350,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"blessing on thy way!"""
351,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
352,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,The lady glanced at the mirroring steel where her
353,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"form of grace was seen,"
354,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Where her eye shone clear, and her dark locks"
355,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,waved their clasping pearls between;
356,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"""Bring forth thy pearl of exceeding worth, thou"
357,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"traveller gray and old,"
358,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"And name the price of thy precious gem, and my"
359,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"page shall count thy gold."""
360,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
361,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"The cloud went off from the pilgrim's brow, as a"
362,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"small and meagre book,"
363,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Unchased with gold or gem of cost, from his"
364,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,folding robe he took!
365,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"""Here, lady fair, is the pearl of price, may it prove"
366,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,as such to thee
367,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Nay, keep thy gold--I ask it not, for the word of"
368,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"God is free!"""
369,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
370,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"The hoary traveller went his way, but the gift he"
371,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,left behind
372,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,Hath had its pure and perfect work on that high-
373,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"born maiden's mind,"
374,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,And she hath turned from the pride of sin to the
375,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"lowliness of truth,"
376,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,And given her human heart to God in its beautiful
377,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,hour of youth
378,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
379,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"And she hath left the gray old halls, where an evil"
380,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"faith had power,"
381,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"The courtly knights of her father's train, and the"
382,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,maidens of her bower;
383,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,And she hath gone to the Vaudois vales by lordly
384,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"feet untrod,"

422,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,
423,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"And thou, young martyr! thou wast there;"
424,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"No white-robed sisters round thee trod,"
425,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"Nor holy hymn, nor funeral prayer"

442,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"Through weary day and wakeful night,"

444,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"Gentle, and meek, and lowly, and unknown,"
445,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Thy mercies measured by thy God alone!
446,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,
447,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"Where manly hearts were failing, where"
448,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"The throngful street grew foul with death,"
449,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"O high-souled martyr! thou wast there,"
450,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"Inhaling, from the loathsome air,"

463,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Innocent teacher of the high

468,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"And the o'er-hovering Spoiler wore, the while,"
469,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"An angel's features, a deliverer's smile!"
470,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,
471,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,A blessed task! and worthy one
472,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"Who, turning from the world, as thou,"
473,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Before life's pathway had begun
474,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"To leave its spring-time flower and sun,"
475,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Had sealed her early vow;
476,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"Giving to God her beauty and her youth,"
477,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Her pure affections and her guileless truth.
478,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,
479,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Earth may not claim thee. Nothing here
480,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Could be for thee a meet reward;
481,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Thine is a treasure far more dear
482,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"Eye hath not seen it, nor the ear"
483,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Of living mortal heard
484,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"The joys prepared, the promised bliss above,"
485,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,The holy presence of Eternal Love!
486,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,
487,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Sleep on in peace. The earth has not
488,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,A nobler name than thine shall be.
489,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"The deeds by martial manhood wrought,"
490,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"The lofty energies of thought,"
491,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"The fire of poesy,"
492,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,These have but frail and fading honors; thine
493,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Shall Time unto Eternity consign.
494,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,
495,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"Yea, and when thrones shall crumble down,"
496,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"And human pride and grandeur fall,"
497,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"The herald's line of long renown,"
498,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"The mitre and the kingly crown,--"
499,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,Perishing glories all!
500,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,The pure devotion of thy generous heart
501,THE FEMALE MARTYR.,"Shall live in Heaven, of which it was a part."

877,PENTUCKET.,"The village of Haverhill, on the Merrimac, called by the Indians"
878,PENTUCKET.,"Pentucket, was for nearly seventeen years a frontier town, and during"
879,PENTUCKET.,thirty years endured all the horrors of savage warfare. In the year
880,PENTUCKET.,"1708, a combined body of French and Indians, under the command of De"
881,PENTUCKET.,"Chaillons, and Hertel de Rouville, the famous and bloody sacker of"
882,PENTUCKET.,"Deerfield, made an attack upon the village, which at that time contained"
883,PENTUCKET.,"only thirty houses. Sixteen of the villagers were massacred, and a still"
884,PENTUCKET.,"larger number made prisoners. About thirty of the enemy also fell, among"
885,PENTUCKET.,"them Hertel de Rouville. The minister of the place, Benjamin Rolfe, was"
886,PENTUCKET.,killed by a shot through his own door. In a paper entitled The Border
887,PENTUCKET.,"War of 1708, published in my collection of Recreations and Miscellanies,"
888,PENTUCKET.,I have given a prose narrative of the surprise of Haverhill.
889,PENTUCKET.,
890,PENTUCKET.,
891,PENTUCKET.,How sweetly on the wood-girt town
892,PENTUCKET.,The mellow light of sunset shone!
893,PENTUCKET.,"Each small, bright lake, whose waters still"

895,PENTUCKET.,Reflected from its waveless breast
896,PENTUCKET.,"The beauty of a cloudless west,"
897,PENTUCKET.,Glorious as if a glimpse were given
898,PENTUCKET.,"Within the western gates of heaven,"
899,PENTUCKET.,"Left, by the spirit of the star"
900,PENTUCKET.,"Of sunset's holy hour, ajar!"
901,PENTUCKET.,
902,PENTUCKET.,Beside the river's tranquil flood
903,PENTUCKET.,"The dark and low-walled dwellings stood,"
904,PENTUCKET.,Where many a rood of open land
905,PENTUCKET.,"Stretched up and down on either hand,"
906,PENTUCKET.,With corn-leaves waving freshly green
907,PENTUCKET.,The thick and blackened stumps between.
908,PENTUCKET.,"Behind, unbroken, deep and dread,"
909,PENTUCKET.,"The wild, untravelled forest spread,"
910,PENTUCKET.,"Back to those mountains, white and cold,"
911,PENTUCKET.,"Of which the Indian trapper told,"
912,PENTUCKET.,Upon whose summits never yet
913,PENTUCKET.,Was mortal foot in safety set.
914,PENTUCKET.,
915,PENTUCKET.,"Quiet and calm without a fear,"
916,PENTUCKET.,"Of danger darkly lurking near,"
917,PENTUCKET.,"The weary laborer left his plough,"
918,PENTUCKET.,The milkmaid carolled by her cow;
919,PENTUCKET.,From cottage door and household hearth
920,PENTUCKET.,"Rose songs of praise, or tones of mirth."
921,PENTUCKET.,
922,PENTUCKET.,"At length the murmur died away,"
923,PENTUCKET.,And silence on that village lay.
924,PENTUCKET.,"--So slept Pompeii, tower and hall,"
925,PENTUCKET.,"Ere the quick earthquake swallowed all,"
926,PENTUCKET.,Undreaming of the fiery fate
927,PENTUCKET.,Which made its dwellings desolate.
928,PENTUCKET.,
929,PENTUCKET.,Hours passed away. By moonlight sped
930,PENTUCKET.,The Merrimac along his bed.
931,PENTUCKET.,"Bathed in the pallid lustre, stood"
932,PENTUCKET.,"Dark cottage-wall and rock and wood,"
933,PENTUCKET.,"Silent, beneath that tranquil beam,"
934,PENTUCKET.,As the hushed grouping of a dream.
935,PENTUCKET.,"Yet on the still air crept a sound,"
936,PENTUCKET.,"No bark of fox, nor rabbit's bound,"
937,PENTUCKET.,"Nor stir of wings, nor waters flowing,"
938,PENTUCKET.,Nor leaves in midnight breezes blowing.
939,PENTUCKET.,
940,PENTUCKET.,"Was that the tread of many feet,"
941,PENTUCKET.,Which downward from the hillside beat?
942,PENTUCKET.,What forms were those which darkly stood
943,PENTUCKET.,Just on the margin of the wood?--
944,PENTUCKET.,"Charred tree-stumps in the moonlight dim,"
945,PENTUCKET.,"Or paling rude, or leafless limb?"
946,PENTUCKET.,"No,--through the trees fierce eyeballs glowed,"
947,PENTUCKET.,"Dark human forms in moonshine showed,"
948,PENTUCKET.,"Wild from their native wilderness,"
949,PENTUCKET.,With painted limbs and battle-dress.
950,PENTUCKET.,
951,PENTUCKET.,A yell the dead might wake to hear
952,PENTUCKET.,"Swelled on the night air, far and clear;"
953,PENTUCKET.,Then smote the Indian tomahawk
954,PENTUCKET.,On crashing door and shattering lock;
955,PENTUCKET.,
956,PENTUCKET.,"Then rang the rifle-shot, and then"
957,PENTUCKET.,"The shrill death-scream of stricken men,--"
958,PENTUCKET.,"Sank the red axe in woman's brain,"
959,PENTUCKET.,And childhood's cry arose in vain.
960,PENTUCKET.,"Bursting through roof and window came,"
961,PENTUCKET.,"Red, fast, and fierce, the kindled flame,"
962,PENTUCKET.,And blended fire and moonlight glared
963,PENTUCKET.,On still dead men and scalp-knives bared.
964,PENTUCKET.,
965,PENTUCKET.,The morning sun looked brightly through
966,PENTUCKET.,"The river willows, wet with dew."
967,PENTUCKET.,"No sound of combat filled the air,"
968,PENTUCKET.,"No shout was heard, nor gunshot there;"
969,PENTUCKET.,Yet still the thick and sullen smoke
970,PENTUCKET.,From smouldering ruins slowly broke;
971,PENTUCKET.,"And on the greensward many a stain,"
972,PENTUCKET.,"And, here and there, the mangled slain,"
973,PENTUCKET.,Told how that midnight bolt had sped
974,PENTUCKET.,"Pentucket, on thy fated head."
975,PENTUCKET.,
976,PENTUCKET.,Even now the villager can tell
977,PENTUCKET.,"Where Rolfe beside his hearthstone fell,"
978,PENTUCKET.,"Still show the door of wasting oak,"
979,PENTUCKET.,"Through which the fatal death-shot broke,"
980,PENTUCKET.,And point the curious stranger where
981,PENTUCKET.,De Rouville's corse lay grim and bare;
982,PENTUCKET.,"Whose hideous head, in death still feared,"
983,PENTUCKET.,Bore not a trace of hair or beard;
984,PENTUCKET.,"And still, within the churchyard ground,"
985,PENTUCKET.,"Heaves darkly up the ancient mound,"

2088,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,
2089,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,"I thought of Paul and Silas, within Philippi's cell,"
2090,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,And how from Peter's sleeping limbs the prison
2091,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,"shackles fell,"
2092,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,Till I seemed to hear the trailing of an angel's
2093,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,"robe of white,"

2095,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,
2096,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,Bless the Lord for all his mercies!--for the peace

2113,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,
2114,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,"At length the heavy bolts fell back, my door was"

2122,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,
2123,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,"And doubt and fear fell on me, shame burned upon"

2125,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,"Swam earth and sky around me, my trembling"

2132,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,"Then the dreary shadows scattered, like a cloud in"

2147,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,Tracing with rope and slender spar their network
2148,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,on the sky.
2149,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,
2150,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,"And there were ancient citizens, cloak-wrapped"
2151,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,"and grave and cold,"

2154,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,"And on his horse, with Rawson, his cruel clerk at"

2167,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,
2168,CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK.,"I cried, ""The Lord rebuke thee, thou smiter of the"

2482,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"closed with a great feast. According to the usages of the chiefs,"

2485,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"was another great feast. Some time after, the wife of Winnepurkit"
2486,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"expressing a desire to visit her father's house was permitted to go,"
2487,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,accompanied by a brave escort of her husband's chief men. But when she
2488,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"wished to return, her father sent a messenger to Saugus, informing her"

2496,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,
2497,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,WE had been wandering for many days
2498,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Through the rough northern country. We had seen
2499,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The sunset, with its bars of purple cloud,"
2500,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Like a new heaven, shine upward from the lake"
2501,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Of Winnepiseogee; and had felt
2502,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The sunrise breezes, midst the leafy isles"
2503,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Which stoop their summer beauty to the lips
2504,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of the bright waters. We had checked our steeds,"
2505,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Silent with wonder, where the mountain wall"
2506,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Is piled to heaven; and, through the narrow rift"
2507,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of the vast rocks, against whose rugged feet"
2508,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Beats the mad torrent with perpetual roar,"
2509,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Where noonday is as twilight, and the wind"
2510,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Comes burdened with the everlasting moan
2511,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Of forests and of far-off waterfalls,"
2512,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"We had looked upward where the summer sky,"
2513,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Tasselled with clouds light-woven by the sun,"
2514,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Sprung its blue arch above the abutting crags
2515,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,O'er-roofing the vast portal of the land
2516,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Beyond the wall of mountains. We had passed
2517,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,The high source of the Saco; and bewildered
2518,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"In the dwarf spruce-belts of the Crystal Hills,"
2519,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Had heard above us, like a voice in the cloud,"
2520,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,The horn of Fabyan sounding; and atop
2521,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Of old Agioochook had seen the mountains
2522,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Piled to the northward, shagged with wood, and thick"
2523,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"As meadow mole-hills,--the far sea of Casco,"
2524,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,A white gleam on the horizon of the east;

2528,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,
2529,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,And we had rested underneath the oaks

2531,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,By the perpetual beating of the falls
2532,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Of the wild Ammonoosuc. We had tracked
2533,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"The winding Pemigewasset, overhung"
2534,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"By beechen shadows, whitening down its rocks,"
2535,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Or lazily gliding through its intervals,"
2536,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,From waving rye-fields sending up the gleam
2537,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Of sunlit waters. We had seen the moon
2538,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Rising behind Umbagog's eastern pines,"
2539,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Like a great Indian camp-fire; and its beams
2540,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,At midnight spanning with a bridge of silver
2541,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,The Merrimac by Uncanoonuc's falls.

2553,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Whose mirror of the beautiful and true,"

2565,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Laughed in the face of his divinity,"
2566,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Plucked off the sacred ephod, quite unshrined"

2570,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Giving the latest news of city stocks

2573,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Glorified by the sunset; and his daughter,"
2574,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,A delicate flower on whom had blown too long
2575,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Those evil winds, which, sweeping from the ice"

2582,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"It chanced that as we turned upon our homeward way,"
2583,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,A drear northeastern storm came howling up
2584,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,The valley of the Saco; and that girl
2585,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Who had stood with us upon Mount Washington,"
2586,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Her brown locks ruffled by the wind which whirled
2587,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"In gusts around its sharp, cold pinnacle,"
2588,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Who had joined our gay trout-fishing in the streams

2590,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Like a bird's carol on the sunrise breeze
2591,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Which swelled our sail amidst the lake's green islands,"
2592,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Shrank from its harsh, chill breath, and visibly drooped"
2593,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Like a flower in the frost. So, in that quiet inn"
2594,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,Which looks from Conway on the mountains piled
2595,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Heavily against the horizon of the north,"
2596,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"Like summer thunder-clouds, we made our home"
2597,THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.,"And while the mist hung over dripping hills,"

3931,KATHLEEN.,"And gave her one of tow,"
3932,KATHLEEN.,
3933,KATHLEEN.,And sent her down to Limerick town
3934,KATHLEEN.,And to a seaman sold
3935,KATHLEEN.,This daughter of an Irish lord
3936,KATHLEEN.,For ten good pounds in gold.
3937,KATHLEEN.,

3942,KATHLEEN.,
3943,KATHLEEN.,Sure that same night the Banshee howled

3945,KATHLEEN.,"And fairy folks, who loved Kathleen,"
3946,KATHLEEN.,With funeral torches came.
3947,KATHLEEN.,
3948,KATHLEEN.,"She watched them glancing through the trees,"
3949,KATHLEEN.,And glimmering down the hill;

3992,KATHLEEN.,
3993,KATHLEEN.,"So up they walked through Boston town,"
3994,KATHLEEN.,"And met a maiden fair,"
3995,KATHLEEN.,A little basket on her arm
3996,KATHLEEN.,So snowy-white and bare.
3997,KATHLEEN.,
3998,KATHLEEN.,"""Come hither, child, and say hast thou"

4075,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,
4076,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,The incident upon which this poem is based is related in a note to
4077,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Bernardin Henri Saint Pierre's Etudes de la Nature. ""We arrived at the"
4078,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"habitation of the Hermits a little before they sat down to their table,"
4079,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,and while they were still at church. J. J. Rousseau proposed to me to
4080,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,offer up our devotions. The hermits were reciting the Litanies of
4081,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Providence, which are remarkably beautiful. After we had addressed our"
4082,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"prayers to God, and the hermits were proceeding to the refectory,"
4083,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Rousseau said to me, with his heart overflowing, 'At this moment I"
4084,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,experience what is said in the gospel: Where two or three are gathered
4085,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. There is here a"
4086,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"feeling of peace and happiness which penetrates the soul.' I said, 'If"
4087,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Finelon had lived, you would have been a Catholic.' He exclaimed, with"
4088,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"tears in his eyes, 'Oh, if Finelon were alive, I would struggle to get"
4089,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"into his service, even as a lackey!'"" In my sketch of Saint Pierre, it"
4090,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,will be seen that I have somewhat antedated the period of his old age.
4091,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"At that time he was not probably more than fifty. In describing him, I"
4092,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,have by no means exaggerated his own history of his mental condition at
4093,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,the period of the story. In the fragmentary Sequel to his Studies of
4094,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Nature, he thus speaks of himself: ""The ingratitude of those of whom I"
4095,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"had deserved kindness, unexpected family misfortunes, the total loss of"
4096,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,my small patrimony through enterprises solely undertaken for the benefit
4097,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"of my country, the debts under which I lay oppressed, the blasting of"
4098,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"all my hopes,--these combined calamities made dreadful inroads upon my"
4099,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,health and reason. . . . I found it impossible to continue in a room
4100,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"where there was company, especially if the doors were shut. I could not"
4101,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"even cross an alley in a public garden, if several persons had got"
4102,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"together in it. When alone, my malady subsided. I felt myself likewise"
4103,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,at ease in places where I saw children only. At the sight of any one
4104,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"walking up to the place where I was, I felt my whole frame agitated, and"
4105,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"retired. I often said to myself, 'My sole study has been to merit well"
4106,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"of mankind; why do I fear them?'"""
4107,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,
4108,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,He attributes his improved health of mind and body to the counsels of
4109,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"his friend, J. J. Rousseau. ""I renounced,"" says he, ""my books. I threw"
4110,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"my eyes upon the works of nature, which spake to all my senses a"
4111,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,language which neither time nor nations have it in their power to alter.
4112,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,Thenceforth my histories and my journals were the herbage of the fields
4113,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"and meadows. My thoughts did not go forth painfully after them, as in"
4114,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"the case of human systems; but their thoughts, under a thousand engaging"
4115,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"forms, quietly sought me. In these I studied, without effort, the laws"
4116,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"of that Universal Wisdom which had surrounded me from the cradle, but on"
4117,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"which heretofore I had bestowed little attention."""
4118,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,
4119,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Speaking of Rousseau, he says: ""I derived inexpressible satisfaction"
4120,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,from his society. What I prized still more than his genius was his
4121,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"probity. He was one of the few literary characters, tried in the furnace"
4122,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"of affliction, to whom you could, with perfect security, confide your"
4123,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"most secret thoughts. . . . Even when he deviated, and became the victim"
4124,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"of himself or of others, he could forget his own misery in devotion to"
4125,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,the welfare of mankind. He was uniformly the advocate of the miserable.
4126,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,There might be inscribed on his tomb these affecting words from that
4127,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"Book of which he carried always about him some select passages, during"
4128,THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS.,"the last years of his life: 'His sins, which are many, are forgiven, for"

4612,TAULER.,Pondering the solemn Miracle of Life;
4613,TAULER.,"As one who, wandering in a starless night,"
4614,TAULER.,"Feels momently the jar of unseen waves,"
4615,TAULER.,"And hears the thunder of an unknown sea,"
4616,TAULER.,Breaking along an unimagined shore.
4617,TAULER.,
4618,TAULER.,And as he walked he prayed. Even the same
4619,TAULER.,"Old prayer with which, for half a score of years,"
4620,TAULER.,"Morning, and noon, and evening, lip and heart"
4621,TAULER.,"Had groaned: ""Have pity upon me, Lord!"

4624,TAULER.,
4625,TAULER.,"Then, as he mused, he heard along his path"
4626,TAULER.,A sound as of an old man's staff among
4627,TAULER.,"The dry, dead linden-leaves; and, looking up,"
4628,TAULER.,"He saw a stranger, weak, and poor, and old."
4629,TAULER.,
4630,TAULER.,"""Peace be unto thee, father!"" Tauler said,"
4631,TAULER.,"""God give thee a good day!"" The old man raised"

4654,TAULER.,
4655,TAULER.,"Silently wondering, for a little space,"

4676,TAULER.,Set like the white moon where the hills of vine

4682,TAULER.,"So, entering with a changed and cheerful step"

4684,TAULER.,"A mighty shadow break the light of noon,"
4685,TAULER.,Which tracing backward till its airy lines
4686,TAULER.,"Hardened to stony plinths, he raised his eyes"
4687,TAULER.,"O'er broad facade and lofty pediment,"

5756,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,was founded solely on a fragment of rhyme which I heard from one of my

5758,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,it referred dated back at least a century. I knew nothing of the
5759,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,"participators, and the narrative of the ballad was pure fancy. I am glad"
5760,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,for the sake of truth and justice that the real facts are given in thy
5761,SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.,"book. I certainly would not knowingly do injustice to any one, dead or"

6493,A HARVEST IDYL.,"Susanna Martin, an aged woman of Amesbury, Mass., was tried and executed"

6499,A HARVEST IDYL.,woman hanged on the north side of the Merrimac during the dreadful
6500,A HARVEST IDYL.,delusion. The aged wife of Judge Bradbury who lived on the other side of

7232,THE PREACHER.,and was buried under the church which has since borne his name.
7233,THE PREACHER.,
7234,THE PREACHER.,"ITS windows flashing to the sky,"
7235,THE PREACHER.,"Beneath a thousand roofs of brown,"
7236,THE PREACHER.,"Far down the vale, my friend and I"
7237,THE PREACHER.,Beheld the old and quiet town;
7238,THE PREACHER.,The ghostly sails that out at sea
7239,THE PREACHER.,Flapped their white wings of mystery;
7240,THE PREACHER.,"The beaches glimmering in the sun,"
7241,THE PREACHER.,And the low wooded capes that run
7242,THE PREACHER.,Into the sea-mist north and south;
7243,THE PREACHER.,The sand-bluffs at the river's mouth;
7244,THE PREACHER.,"The swinging chain-bridge, and, afar,"
7245,THE PREACHER.,The foam-line of the harbor-bar.
7246,THE PREACHER.,
7247,THE PREACHER.,Over the woods and meadow-lands
7248,THE PREACHER.,"A crimson-tinted shadow lay,"
7249,THE PREACHER.,Of clouds through which the setting day
7250,THE PREACHER.,Flung a slant glory far away.
7251,THE PREACHER.,"It glittered on the wet sea-sands,"
7252,THE PREACHER.,"It flamed upon the city's panes,"
7253,THE PREACHER.,Smote the white sails of ships that wore
7254,THE PREACHER.,"Outward or in, and glided o'er"
7255,THE PREACHER.,The steeples with their veering vanes!
7256,THE PREACHER.,
7257,THE PREACHER.,Awhile my friend with rapid search
7258,THE PREACHER.,"O'erran the landscape. ""Yonder spire"
7259,THE PREACHER.,"Over gray roofs, a shaft of fire;"
7260,THE PREACHER.,"What is it, pray?""--""The Whitefield Church!"
7261,THE PREACHER.,"Walled about by its basement stones,"
7262,THE PREACHER.,"There rest the marvellous prophet's bones."""
7263,THE PREACHER.,"Then as our homeward way we walked,"
7264,THE PREACHER.,Of the great preacher's life we talked;
7265,THE PREACHER.,And through the mystery of our theme
7266,THE PREACHER.,"The outward glory seemed to stream,"
7267,THE PREACHER.,And Nature's self interpreted
7268,THE PREACHER.,The doubtful record of the dead;
7269,THE PREACHER.,And every level beam that smote
7270,THE PREACHER.,The sails upon the dark afloat
7271,THE PREACHER.,"A symbol of the light became,"
7272,THE PREACHER.,"Which touched the shadows of our blame,"
7273,THE PREACHER.,With tongues of Pentecostal flame.
7274,THE PREACHER.,
7275,THE PREACHER.,Over the roofs of the pioneers
7276,THE PREACHER.,Gathers the moss of a hundred years;
7277,THE PREACHER.,On man and his works has passed the change
7278,THE PREACHER.,Which needs must be in a century's range.
7279,THE PREACHER.,"The land lies open and warm in the sun,"
7280,THE PREACHER.,"Anvils clamor and mill-wheels run,--"
7281,THE PREACHER.,"Flocks on the hillsides, herds on the plain,"
7282,THE PREACHER.,The wilderness gladdened with fruit and grain!
7283,THE PREACHER.,But the living faith of the settlers old
7284,THE PREACHER.,A dead profession their children hold;
7285,THE PREACHER.,To the lust of office and greed of trade
7286,THE PREACHER.,A stepping-stone is the altar made.
7287,THE PREACHER.,
7288,THE PREACHER.,"The church, to place and power the door,"
7289,THE PREACHER.,"Rebukes the sin of the world no more,"
7290,THE PREACHER.,Nor sees its Lord in the homeless poor.
7291,THE PREACHER.,"Everywhere is the grasping hand,"
7292,THE PREACHER.,And eager adding of land to land;
7293,THE PREACHER.,"And earth, which seemed to the fathers meant"
7294,THE PREACHER.,"But as a pilgrim's wayside tent,--"

7298,THE PREACHER.,And Time has forgotten Eternity!
7299,THE PREACHER.,
7300,THE PREACHER.,But fresh and green from the rotting roots
7301,THE PREACHER.,Of primal forests the young growth shoots;
7302,THE PREACHER.,"From the death of the old the new proceeds,"
7303,THE PREACHER.,And the life of truth from the rot of creeds
7304,THE PREACHER.,"On the ladder of God, which upward leads,"
7305,THE PREACHER.,The steps of progress are human needs.
7306,THE PREACHER.,"For His judgments still are a mighty deep,"
7307,THE PREACHER.,And the eyes of His providence never sleep
7308,THE PREACHER.,When the night is darkest He gives the morn;
7309,THE PREACHER.,"When the famine is sorest, the wine and corn!"
7310,THE PREACHER.,
7311,THE PREACHER.,"In the church of the wilderness Edwards wrought,"
7312,THE PREACHER.,Shaping his creed at the forge of thought;
7313,THE PREACHER.,And with Thor's own hammer welded and bent
7314,THE PREACHER.,"The iron links of his argument,"
7315,THE PREACHER.,Which strove to grasp in its mighty span
7316,THE PREACHER.,The purpose of God and the fate of man
7317,THE PREACHER.,"Yet faithful still, in his daily round"
7318,THE PREACHER.,"To the weak, and the poor, and sin-sick found,"
7319,THE PREACHER.,The schoolman's lore and the casuist's art
7320,THE PREACHER.,Drew warmth and life from his fervent heart.
7321,THE PREACHER.,
7322,THE PREACHER.,Had he not seen in the solitudes
7323,THE PREACHER.,Of his deep and dark Northampton woods
7324,THE PREACHER.,A vision of love about him fall?
7325,THE PREACHER.,"Not the blinding splendor which fell on Saul,"
7326,THE PREACHER.,But the tenderer glory that rests on them
7327,THE PREACHER.,"Who walk in the New Jerusalem,"
7328,THE PREACHER.,"Where never the sun nor moon are known,"
7329,THE PREACHER.,But the Lord and His love are the light alone
7330,THE PREACHER.,"And watching the sweet, still countenance"
7331,THE PREACHER.,"Of the wife of his bosom rapt in trance,"
7332,THE PREACHER.,Had he not treasured each broken word
7333,THE PREACHER.,Of the mystical wonder seen and heard;
7334,THE PREACHER.,And loved the beautiful dreamer more
7335,THE PREACHER.,That thus to the desert of earth she bore
7336,THE PREACHER.,Clusters of Eshcol from Canaan's shore?
7337,THE PREACHER.,
7338,THE PREACHER.,"As the barley-winnower, holding with pain"
7339,THE PREACHER.,"Aloft in waiting his chaff and grain,"
7340,THE PREACHER.,Joyfully welcomes the far-off breeze
7341,THE PREACHER.,"Sounding the pine-tree's slender keys,"
7342,THE PREACHER.,So he who had waited long to hear
7343,THE PREACHER.,"The sound of the Spirit drawing near,"
7344,THE PREACHER.,Like that which the son of Iddo heard
7345,THE PREACHER.,"When the feet of angels the myrtles stirred,"
7346,THE PREACHER.,"Felt the answer of prayer, at last,"
7347,THE PREACHER.,"As over his church the afflatus passed,"
7348,THE PREACHER.,Breaking its sleep as breezes break
7349,THE PREACHER.,To sun-bright ripples a stagnant lake.
7350,THE PREACHER.,
7351,THE PREACHER.,"At first a tremor of silent fear,"
7352,THE PREACHER.,"The creep of the flesh at danger near,"
7353,THE PREACHER.,"A vague foreboding and discontent,"
7354,THE PREACHER.,Over the hearts of the people went.
7355,THE PREACHER.,All nature warned in sounds and signs
7356,THE PREACHER.,The wind in the tops of the forest pines
7357,THE PREACHER.,"In the name of the Highest called to prayer,"
7358,THE PREACHER.,As the muezzin calls from the minaret stair.
7359,THE PREACHER.,Through ceiled chambers of secret sin
7360,THE PREACHER.,Sudden and strong the light shone in;
7361,THE PREACHER.,A guilty sense of his neighbor's needs
7362,THE PREACHER.,Startled the man of title-deeds;
7363,THE PREACHER.,The trembling hand of the worldling shook
7364,THE PREACHER.,The dust of years from the Holy Book;
7365,THE PREACHER.,"And the psalms of David, forgotten long,"
7366,THE PREACHER.,Took the place of the scoffer's song.
7367,THE PREACHER.,
7368,THE PREACHER.,The impulse spread like the outward course
7369,THE PREACHER.,Of waters moved by a central force;
7370,THE PREACHER.,The tide of spiritual life rolled down
7371,THE PREACHER.,From inland mountains to seaboard town.
7372,THE PREACHER.,
7373,THE PREACHER.,Prepared and ready the altar stands
7374,THE PREACHER.,Waiting the prophet's outstretched hands
7375,THE PREACHER.,"And prayer availing, to downward call"
7376,THE PREACHER.,The fiery answer in view of all.
7377,THE PREACHER.,Hearts are like wax in the furnace; who
7378,THE PREACHER.,"Shall mould, and shape, and cast them anew?"
7379,THE PREACHER.,Lo! by the Merrimac Whitefield stands
7380,THE PREACHER.,"In the temple that never was made by hands,--"
7381,THE PREACHER.,"Curtains of azure, and crystal wall,"
7382,THE PREACHER.,And dome of the sunshine over all--
7383,THE PREACHER.,"A homeless pilgrim, with dubious name"
7384,THE PREACHER.,Blown about on the winds of fame;
7385,THE PREACHER.,"Now as an angel of blessing classed,"
7386,THE PREACHER.,And now as a mad enthusiast.
7387,THE PREACHER.,Called in his youth to sound and gauge
7388,THE PREACHER.,"The moral lapse of his race and age,"
7389,THE PREACHER.,"And, sharp as truth, the contrast draw"
7390,THE PREACHER.,Of human frailty and perfect law;
7391,THE PREACHER.,Possessed by the one dread thought that lent
7392,THE PREACHER.,"Its goad to his fiery temperament,"
7393,THE PREACHER.,"Up and down the world he went,"
7394,THE PREACHER.,"A John the Baptist crying, Repent!"
7395,THE PREACHER.,
7396,THE PREACHER.,No perfect whole can our nature make;
7397,THE PREACHER.,Here or there the circle will break;
7398,THE PREACHER.,The orb of life as it takes the light
7399,THE PREACHER.,On one side leaves the other in night.
7400,THE PREACHER.,Never was saint so good and great
7401,THE PREACHER.,As to give no chance at St. Peter's gate
7402,THE PREACHER.,For the plea of the Devil's advocate.
7403,THE PREACHER.,"So, incomplete by his being's law,"
7404,THE PREACHER.,The marvellous preacher had his flaw;
7405,THE PREACHER.,"With step unequal, and lame with faults,"
7406,THE PREACHER.,His shade on the path of History halts.
7407,THE PREACHER.,
7408,THE PREACHER.,Wisely and well said the Eastern bard
7409,THE PREACHER.,"Fear is easy, but love is hard,--"
7410,THE PREACHER.,"Easy to glow with the Santon's rage,"
7411,THE PREACHER.,And walk on the Meccan pilgrimage;
7412,THE PREACHER.,But he is greatest and best who can
7413,THE PREACHER.,Worship Allah by loving man.
7414,THE PREACHER.,"Thus he,--to whom, in the painful stress"
7415,THE PREACHER.,"Of zeal on fire from its own excess,"
7416,THE PREACHER.,Heaven seemed so vast and earth so small
7417,THE PREACHER.,"That man was nothing, since God was all,--"
7418,THE PREACHER.,"Forgot, as the best at times have done,"
7419,THE PREACHER.,That the love of the Lord and of man are one.
7420,THE PREACHER.,Little to him whose feet unshod
7421,THE PREACHER.,"The thorny path of the desert trod,"
7422,THE PREACHER.,"Careless of pain, so it led to God,"
7423,THE PREACHER.,"Seemed the hunger-pang and the poor man's wrong,"
7424,THE PREACHER.,The weak ones trodden beneath the strong.
7425,THE PREACHER.,Should the worm be chooser?--the clay withstand
7426,THE PREACHER.,The shaping will of the potter's hand?
7427,THE PREACHER.,
7428,THE PREACHER.,In the Indian fable Arjoon hears
7429,THE PREACHER.,The scorn of a god rebuke his fears
7430,THE PREACHER.,"""Spare thy pity!"" Krishna saith;"
7431,THE PREACHER.,"""Not in thy sword is the power of death!"
7432,THE PREACHER.,"All is illusion,--loss but seems;"
7433,THE PREACHER.,Pleasure and pain are only dreams;
7434,THE PREACHER.,Who deems he slayeth doth not kill;
7435,THE PREACHER.,Who counts as slain is living still.
7436,THE PREACHER.,"Strike, nor fear thy blow is crime;"
7437,THE PREACHER.,Nothing dies but the cheats of time;
7438,THE PREACHER.,"Slain or slayer, small the odds"
7439,THE PREACHER.,"To each, immortal as Indra's gods!"""
7440,THE PREACHER.,
7441,THE PREACHER.,"So by Savannah's banks of shade,"
7442,THE PREACHER.,The stones of his mission the preacher laid
7443,THE PREACHER.,"On the heart of the negro crushed and rent,"
7444,THE PREACHER.,And made of his blood the wall's cement;
7445,THE PREACHER.,"Bade the slave-ship speed from coast to coast,"
7446,THE PREACHER.,Fanned by the wings of the Holy Ghost;
7447,THE PREACHER.,"And begged, for the love of Christ, the gold"
7448,THE PREACHER.,Coined from the hearts in its groaning hold.
7449,THE PREACHER.,"What could it matter, more or less"
7450,THE PREACHER.,"Of stripes, and hunger, and weariness?"
7451,THE PREACHER.,"Living or dying, bond or free,"
7452,THE PREACHER.,What was time to eternity?
7453,THE PREACHER.,
7454,THE PREACHER.,Alas for the preacher's cherished schemes!
7455,THE PREACHER.,Mission and church are now but dreams;
7456,THE PREACHER.,Nor prayer nor fasting availed the plan
7457,THE PREACHER.,To honor God through the wrong of man.
7458,THE PREACHER.,Of all his labors no trace remains
7459,THE PREACHER.,Save the bondman lifting his hands in chains.
7460,THE PREACHER.,The woof he wove in the righteous warp
7461,THE PREACHER.,"Of freedom-loving Oglethorpe,"
7462,THE PREACHER.,"Clothes with curses the goodly land,"
7463,THE PREACHER.,Changes its greenness and bloom to sand;
7464,THE PREACHER.,And a century's lapse reveals once more
7465,THE PREACHER.,The slave-ship stealing to Georgia's shore.
7466,THE PREACHER.,Father of Light! how blind is he
7467,THE PREACHER.,Who sprinkles the altar he rears to Thee
7468,THE PREACHER.,With the blood and tears of humanity!
7469,THE PREACHER.,
7470,THE PREACHER.,He erred: shall we count His gifts as naught?
7471,THE PREACHER.,Was the work of God in him unwrought?
7472,THE PREACHER.,"The servant may through his deafness err,"
7473,THE PREACHER.,And blind may be God's messenger;
7474,THE PREACHER.,"But the Errand is sure they go upon,--"
7475,THE PREACHER.,"The word is spoken, the deed is done."
7476,THE PREACHER.,Was the Hebrew temple less fair and good
7477,THE PREACHER.,That Solomon bowed to gods of wood?
7478,THE PREACHER.,"For his tempted heart and wandering feet,"
7479,THE PREACHER.,Were the songs of David less pure and sweet?
7480,THE PREACHER.,"So in light and shadow the preacher went,"
7481,THE PREACHER.,God's erring and human instrument;
7482,THE PREACHER.,And the hearts of the people where he passed
7483,THE PREACHER.,"Swayed as the reeds sway in the blast,"
7484,THE PREACHER.,Under the spell of a voice which took
7485,THE PREACHER.,"In its compass the flow of Siloa's brook,"
7486,THE PREACHER.,And the mystical chime of the bells of gold
7487,THE PREACHER.,"On the ephod's hem of the priest of old,--"
7488,THE PREACHER.,"Now the roll of thunder, and now the awe"
7489,THE PREACHER.,Of the trumpet heard in the Mount of Law.
7490,THE PREACHER.,
7491,THE PREACHER.,A solemn fear on the listening crowd
7492,THE PREACHER.,Fell like the shadow of a cloud.
7493,THE PREACHER.,The sailor reeling from out the ships
7494,THE PREACHER.,Whose masts stood thick in the river-slips
7495,THE PREACHER.,Felt the jest and the curse die on his lips.
7496,THE PREACHER.,"Listened the fisherman rude and hard,"
7497,THE PREACHER.,The calker rough from the builder's yard;
7498,THE PREACHER.,"The man of the market left his load,"
7499,THE PREACHER.,"The teamster leaned on his bending goad,"
7500,THE PREACHER.,"The maiden, and youth beside her, felt"
7501,THE PREACHER.,"Their hearts in a closer union melt,"
7502,THE PREACHER.,And saw the flowers of their love in bloom
7503,THE PREACHER.,Down the endless vistas of life to come.
7504,THE PREACHER.,Old age sat feebly brushing away
7505,THE PREACHER.,From his ears the scanty locks of gray;
7506,THE PREACHER.,"And careless boyhood, living the free"
7507,THE PREACHER.,"Unconscious life of bird and tree,"
7508,THE PREACHER.,Suddenly wakened to a sense
7509,THE PREACHER.,Of sin and its guilty consequence.
7510,THE PREACHER.,It was as if an angel's voice
7511,THE PREACHER.,Called the listeners up for their final choice;
7512,THE PREACHER.,As if a strong hand rent apart
7513,THE PREACHER.,"The veils of sense from soul and heart,"
7514,THE PREACHER.,Showing in light ineffable
7515,THE PREACHER.,The joys of heaven and woes of hell
7516,THE PREACHER.,All about in the misty air
7517,THE PREACHER.,The hills seemed kneeling in silent prayer;
7518,THE PREACHER.,"The rustle of leaves, the moaning sedge,"
7519,THE PREACHER.,"The water's lap on its gravelled edge,"
7520,THE PREACHER.,"The wailing pines, and, far and faint,"
7521,THE PREACHER.,"The wood-dove's note of sad complaint,--"
7522,THE PREACHER.,To the solemn voice of the preacher lent
7523,THE PREACHER.,An undertone as of low lament;
7524,THE PREACHER.,"And the note of the sea from its sand coast,"
7525,THE PREACHER.,"On the easterly wind, now heard, now lost,"
7526,THE PREACHER.,Seemed the murmurous sound of the judgment host.
7527,THE PREACHER.,
7528,THE PREACHER.,"Yet wise men doubted, and good men wept,"
7529,THE PREACHER.,"As that storm of passion above them swept,"
7530,THE PREACHER.,"And, comet-like, adding flame to flame,"
7531,THE PREACHER.,"The priests of the new Evangel came,--"
7532,THE PREACHER.,"Davenport, flashing upon the crowd,"
7533,THE PREACHER.,"Charged like summer's electric cloud,"
7534,THE PREACHER.,Now holding the listener still as death
7535,THE PREACHER.,"With terrible warnings under breath,"
7536,THE PREACHER.,"Now shouting for joy, as if he viewed"
7537,THE PREACHER.,The vision of Heaven's beatitude!
7538,THE PREACHER.,"And Celtic Tennant, his long coat bound"
7539,THE PREACHER.,"Like a monk's with leathern girdle round,"
7540,THE PREACHER.,"Wild with the toss of unshorn hair,"
7541,THE PREACHER.,"And wringing of hands, and, eyes aglare,"
7542,THE PREACHER.,Groaning under the world's despair!
7543,THE PREACHER.,"Grave pastors, grieving their flocks to lose,"
7544,THE PREACHER.,Prophesied to the empty pews
7545,THE PREACHER.,"That gourds would wither, and mushrooms die,"
7546,THE PREACHER.,"And noisiest fountains run soonest dry,"
7547,THE PREACHER.,"Like the spring that gushed in Newbury Street,"
7548,THE PREACHER.,"Under the tramp of the earthquake's feet,"
7549,THE PREACHER.,"A silver shaft in the air and light,"
7550,THE PREACHER.,"For a single day, then lost in night,"
7551,THE PREACHER.,"Leaving only, its place to tell,"
7552,THE PREACHER.,Sandy fissure and sulphurous smell.
7553,THE PREACHER.,"With zeal wing-clipped and white-heat cool,"
7554,THE PREACHER.,"Moved by the spirit in grooves of rule,"
7555,THE PREACHER.,"No longer harried, and cropped, and fleeced,"
7556,THE PREACHER.,"Flogged by sheriff and cursed by priest,"
7557,THE PREACHER.,But by wiser counsels left at ease
7558,THE PREACHER.,"To settle quietly on his lees,"
7559,THE PREACHER.,"And, self-concentred, to count as done"
7560,THE PREACHER.,"The work which his fathers well begun,"
7561,THE PREACHER.,"In silent protest of letting alone,"
7562,THE PREACHER.,"The Quaker kept the way of his own,--"
7563,THE PREACHER.,"A non-conductor among the wires,"
7564,THE PREACHER.,With coat of asbestos proof to fires.
7565,THE PREACHER.,And quite unable to mend his pace
7566,THE PREACHER.,"To catch the falling manna of grace,"
7567,THE PREACHER.,He hugged the closer his little store
7568,THE PREACHER.,"Of faith, and silently prayed for more."
7569,THE PREACHER.,"And vague of creed and barren of rite,"
7570,THE PREACHER.,"But holding, as in his Master's sight,"
7571,THE PREACHER.,"Act and thought to the inner light,"
7572,THE PREACHER.,"The round of his simple duties walked,"
7573,THE PREACHER.,And strove to live what the others talked.
7574,THE PREACHER.,
7575,THE PREACHER.,And who shall marvel if evil went
7576,THE PREACHER.,"Step by step with the good intent,"
7577,THE PREACHER.,"And with love and meekness, side by side,"
7578,THE PREACHER.,Lust of the flesh and spiritual pride?--
7579,THE PREACHER.,That passionate longings and fancies vain
7580,THE PREACHER.,Set the heart on fire and crazed the brain?
7581,THE PREACHER.,That over the holy oracles
7582,THE PREACHER.,Folly sported with cap and bells?
7583,THE PREACHER.,That goodly women and learned men
7584,THE PREACHER.,Marvelling told with tongue and pen
7585,THE PREACHER.,How unweaned children chirped like birds
7586,THE PREACHER.,"Texts of Scripture and solemn words,"
7587,THE PREACHER.,Like the infant seers of the rocky glens
7588,THE PREACHER.,In the Puy de Dome of wild Cevennes
7589,THE PREACHER.,Or baby Lamas who pray and preach
7590,THE PREACHER.,From Tartir cradles in Buddha's speech?
7591,THE PREACHER.,
7592,THE PREACHER.,In the war which Truth or Freedom wages
7593,THE PREACHER.,"With impious fraud and the wrong of ages,"
7594,THE PREACHER.,Hate and malice and self-love mar

8487,TO E. W.,to whose kindness I was much indebted in my boyhood. He was the one
8488,TO E. W.,cultivated man in the neighborhood. His small but well-chosen library
8489,TO E. W.,"was placed at my disposal. He is the ""wise old doctor"" of Snow-Bound."
8490,TO E. W.,Count Francois de Vipart with his cousin Joseph Rochemont de Poyen came
8491,TO E. W.,to the United States in the early part of the present century. They took
8492,TO E. W.,"up their residence at Rocks Village on the Merrimac, where they both"
8493,TO E. W.,"married. The wife of Count Vipart was Mary Ingalls, who as my father"
8494,TO E. W.,"remembered her was a very lovely young girl. Her wedding dress, as"
8495,TO E. W.,"described by a lady still living, was ""pink satin with an overdress of"
8496,TO E. W.,"white lace, and white satin slippers."" She died in less than a year"

8718,AMONG THE HILLS,"This poem, when originally published, was dedicated to Annie Fields,"
8719,AMONG THE HILLS,"wife of the distinguished publisher, James T. Fields, of Boston, in"
8720,AMONG THE HILLS,grateful acknowledgment of the strength and inspiration I have found in
8721,AMONG THE HILLS,her friendship and sympathy. The poem in its first form was entitled The
8722,AMONG THE HILLS,"Wife: an Idyl of Bearcamp Water, and appeared in The Atlantic Monthly"
8723,AMONG THE HILLS,"for January, 1868. When I published the volume Among the Hills, in"
8724,AMONG THE HILLS,"December of the same year, I expanded the Prelude and filled out also"
8725,AMONG THE HILLS,the outlines of the story.

8728,PRELUDE.,PRELUDE.
8729,PRELUDE.,
8730,PRELUDE.,"ALONG the roadside, like the flowers of gold"
8731,PRELUDE.,"That tawny Incas for their gardens wrought,"
8732,PRELUDE.,"Heavy with sunshine droops the golden-rod,"
8733,PRELUDE.,And the red pennons of the cardinal-flowers
8734,PRELUDE.,Hang motionless upon their upright staves.
8735,PRELUDE.,"The sky is hot and hazy, and the wind,"
8736,PRELUDE.,"Vying-weary with its long flight from the south,"
8737,PRELUDE.,"Unfelt; yet, closely scanned, yon maple leaf"
8738,PRELUDE.,"With faintest motion, as one stirs in dreams,"
8739,PRELUDE.,Confesses it. The locust by the wall
8740,PRELUDE.,Stabs the noon-silence with his sharp alarm.
8741,PRELUDE.,A single hay-cart down the dusty road
8742,PRELUDE.,"Creaks slowly, with its driver fast asleep"
8743,PRELUDE.,"On the load's top. Against the neighboring hill,"
8744,PRELUDE.,"Huddled along the stone wall's shady side,"
8745,PRELUDE.,"The sheep show white, as if a snowdrift still"
8746,PRELUDE.,Defied the dog-star. Through the open door
8747,PRELUDE.,"A drowsy smell of flowers-gray heliotrope,"
8748,PRELUDE.,"And white sweet clover, and shy mignonette--"
8749,PRELUDE.,"Comes faintly in, and silent chorus lends"
8750,PRELUDE.,To the pervading symphony of peace.
8751,PRELUDE.,No time is this for hands long over-worn
8752,PRELUDE.,To task their strength; and (unto Him be praise
8753,PRELUDE.,Who giveth quietness!) the stress and strain
8754,PRELUDE.,Of years that did the work of centuries
8755,PRELUDE.,"Have ceased, and we can draw our breath once more"
8756,PRELUDE.,"Freely and full. So, as yon harvesters"
8757,PRELUDE.,Make glad their nooning underneath the elms
8758,PRELUDE.,"With tale and riddle and old snatch of song,"
8759,PRELUDE.,"I lay aside grave themes, and idly turn"
8760,PRELUDE.,"The leaves of memory's sketch-book, dreaming o'er"
8761,PRELUDE.,"Old summer pictures of the quiet hills,"
8762,PRELUDE.,"And human life, as quiet, at their feet."
8763,PRELUDE.,
8764,PRELUDE.,"And yet not idly all. A farmer's son,"
8765,PRELUDE.,"Proud of field-lore and harvest craft, and feeling"
8766,PRELUDE.,"All their fine possibilities, how rich"
8767,PRELUDE.,And restful even poverty and toil
8768,PRELUDE.,"Become when beauty, harmony, and love"
8769,PRELUDE.,Sit at their humble hearth as angels sat
8770,PRELUDE.,"At evening in the patriarch's tent, when man"
8771,PRELUDE.,"Makes labor noble, and his farmer's frock"
8772,PRELUDE.,The symbol of a Christian chivalry
8773,PRELUDE.,Tender and just and generous to her
8774,PRELUDE.,"Who clothes with grace all duty; still, I know"
8775,PRELUDE.,"Too well the picture has another side,--"
8776,PRELUDE.,How wearily the grind of toil goes on
8777,PRELUDE.,"Where love is wanting, how the eye and ear"
8778,PRELUDE.,And heart are starved amidst the plenitude
8779,PRELUDE.,"Of nature, and how hard and colorless"
8780,PRELUDE.,Is life without an atmosphere. I look
8781,PRELUDE.,"Across the lapse of half a century,"
8782,PRELUDE.,"And call to mind old homesteads, where no flower"
8783,PRELUDE.,"Told that the spring had come, but evil weeds,"
8784,PRELUDE.,Nightshade and rough-leaved burdock in the place
8785,PRELUDE.,Of the sweet doorway greeting of the rose
8786,PRELUDE.,"And honeysuckle, where the house walls seemed"
8787,PRELUDE.,"Blistering in sun, without a tree or vine"
8788,PRELUDE.,To cast the tremulous shadow of its leaves
8789,PRELUDE.,"Across the curtainless windows, from whose panes"
8790,PRELUDE.,Fluttered the signal rags of shiftlessness.
8791,PRELUDE.,"Within, the cluttered kitchen-floor, unwashed"
8792,PRELUDE.,(Broom-clean I think they called it); the best room
8793,PRELUDE.,"Stifling with cellar damp, shut from the air"
8794,PRELUDE.,"In hot midsummer, bookless, pictureless,"
8795,PRELUDE.,Save the inevitable sampler hung
8796,PRELUDE.,"Over the fireplace, or a mourning piece,"
8797,PRELUDE.,"A green-haired woman, peony-cheeked, beneath"
8798,PRELUDE.,Impossible willows; the wide-throated hearth
8799,PRELUDE.,Bristling with faded pine-boughs half concealing
8800,PRELUDE.,The piled-up rubbish at the chimney's back;
8801,PRELUDE.,"And, in sad keeping with all things about them,"
8802,PRELUDE.,"Shrill, querulous-women, sour and sullen men,"
8803,PRELUDE.,"Untidy, loveless, old before their time,"
8804,PRELUDE.,With scarce a human interest save their own
8805,PRELUDE.,"Monotonous round of small economies,"
8806,PRELUDE.,Or the poor scandal of the neighborhood;
8807,PRELUDE.,"Blind to the beauty everywhere revealed,"
8808,PRELUDE.,Treading the May-flowers with regardless feet;
8809,PRELUDE.,For them the song-sparrow and the bobolink
8810,PRELUDE.,"Sang not, nor winds made music in the leaves;"
8811,PRELUDE.,For them in vain October's holocaust
8812,PRELUDE.,"Burned, gold and crimson, over all the hills,"
8813,PRELUDE.,The sacramental mystery of the woods.
8814,PRELUDE.,"Church-goers, fearful of the unseen Powers,"
8815,PRELUDE.,"But grumbling over pulpit-tax and pew-rent,"
8816,PRELUDE.,"Saving, as shrewd economists, their souls"
8817,PRELUDE.,And winter pork with the least possible outlay
8818,PRELUDE.,Of salt and sanctity; in daily life
8819,PRELUDE.,Showing as little actual comprehension
8820,PRELUDE.,"Of Christian charity and love and duty,"
8821,PRELUDE.,As if the Sermon on the Mount had been
8822,PRELUDE.,Outdated like a last year's almanac
8823,PRELUDE.,"Rich in broad woodlands and in half-tilled fields,"
8824,PRELUDE.,"And yet so pinched and bare and comfortless,"
8825,PRELUDE.,"The veriest straggler limping on his rounds,"
8826,PRELUDE.,"The sun and air his sole inheritance,"
8827,PRELUDE.,"Laughed at a poverty that paid its taxes,"
8828,PRELUDE.,And hugged his rags in self-complacency!
8829,PRELUDE.,
8830,PRELUDE.,Not such should be the homesteads of a land
8831,PRELUDE.,Where whoso wisely wills and acts may dwell
8832,PRELUDE.,"As king and lawgiver, in broad-acred state,"
8833,PRELUDE.,"With beauty, art, taste, culture, books, to make"
8834,PRELUDE.,His hour of leisure richer than a life
8835,PRELUDE.,"Of fourscore to the barons of old time,"
8836,PRELUDE.,Our yeoman should be equal to his home
8837,PRELUDE.,"Set in the fair, green valleys, purple walled,"
8838,PRELUDE.,"A man to match his mountains, not to creep"
8839,PRELUDE.,Dwarfed and abased below them. I would fain
8840,PRELUDE.,In this light way (of which I needs must own
8841,PRELUDE.,"With the knife-grinder of whom Canning sings,"
8842,PRELUDE.,"""Story, God bless you! I have none to tell you!"")"
8843,PRELUDE.,Invite the eye to see and heart to feel
8844,PRELUDE.,"The beauty and the joy within their reach,--"
8845,PRELUDE.,"Home, and home loves, and the beatitudes"
8846,PRELUDE.,Of nature free to all. Haply in years
8847,PRELUDE.,"That wait to take the places of our own,"
8848,PRELUDE.,Heard where some breezy balcony looks down
8849,PRELUDE.,"On happy homes, or where the lake in the moon"
8850,PRELUDE.,"Sleeps dreaming of the mountains, fair as Ruth,"
8851,PRELUDE.,"In the old Hebrew pastoral, at the feet"
8852,PRELUDE.,"Of Boaz, even this simple lay of mine"
8853,PRELUDE.,"May seem the burden of a prophecy,"
8854,PRELUDE.,Finding its late fulfilment in a change
8855,PRELUDE.,"Slow as the oak's growth, lifting manhood up"
8856,PRELUDE.,"Through broader culture, finer manners, love,"
8857,PRELUDE.,"And reverence, to the level of the hills."
8858,PRELUDE.,
8859,PRELUDE.,"O Golden Age, whose light is of the dawn,"
8860,PRELUDE.,"And not of sunset, forward, not behind,"
8861,PRELUDE.,"Flood the new heavens and earth, and with thee bring"
8862,PRELUDE.,"All the old virtues, whatsoever things"
8863,PRELUDE.,"Are pure and honest and of good repute,"
8864,PRELUDE.,But add thereto whatever bard has sung
8865,PRELUDE.,Or seer has told of when in trance and dream
8866,PRELUDE.,They saw the Happy Isles of prophecy
8867,PRELUDE.,"Let Justice hold her scale, and Truth divide"
8868,PRELUDE.,Between the right and wrong; but give the heart
8869,PRELUDE.,The freedom of its fair inheritance;
8870,PRELUDE.,"Let the poor prisoner, cramped and starved so long,"
8871,PRELUDE.,At Nature's table feast his ear and eye
8872,PRELUDE.,With joy and wonder; let all harmonies
8873,PRELUDE.,"Of sound, form, color, motion, wait upon"
8874,PRELUDE.,"The princely guest, whether in soft attire"
8875,PRELUDE.,"Of leisure clad, or the coarse frock of toil,"
8876,PRELUDE.,"And, lending life to the dead form of faith,"
8877,PRELUDE.,Give human nature reverence for the sake
8878,PRELUDE.,"Of One who bore it, making it divine"
8879,PRELUDE.,With the ineffable tenderness of God;
8880,PRELUDE.,"Let common need, the brotherhood of prayer,"
8881,PRELUDE.,"The heirship of an unknown destiny,"
8882,PRELUDE.,"The unsolved mystery round about us, make"
8883,PRELUDE.,A man more precious than the gold of Ophir.
8884,PRELUDE.,"Sacred, inviolate, unto whom all things"
8885,PRELUDE.,"Should minister, as outward types and signs"
8886,PRELUDE.,Of the eternal beauty which fulfils
8887,PRELUDE.,"The one great purpose of creation, Love,"
8888,PRELUDE.,The sole necessity of Earth and Heaven!
8889,PRELUDE.,
8890,PRELUDE.,. . . . . . . . . . .
8891,PRELUDE.,
8892,PRELUDE.,For weeks the clouds had raked the hills
8893,PRELUDE.,"And vexed the vales with raining,"
8894,PRELUDE.,"And all the woods were sad with mist,"
8895,PRELUDE.,And all the brooks complaining.
8896,PRELUDE.,
8897,PRELUDE.,"At last, a sudden night-storm tore"
8898,PRELUDE.,"The mountain veils asunder,"
8899,PRELUDE.,And swept the valleys clean before
8900,PRELUDE.,The besom of the thunder.
8901,PRELUDE.,
8902,PRELUDE.,Through Sandwich notch the west-wind sang
8903,PRELUDE.,Good morrow to the cotter;
8904,PRELUDE.,And once again Chocorua's horn
8905,PRELUDE.,Of shadow pierced the water.
8906,PRELUDE.,
8907,PRELUDE.,"Above his broad lake Ossipee,"
8908,PRELUDE.,"Once more the sunshine wearing,"
8909,PRELUDE.,"Stooped, tracing on that silver shield"
8910,PRELUDE.,His grim armorial bearing.
8911,PRELUDE.,
8912,PRELUDE.,"Clear drawn against the hard blue sky,"
8913,PRELUDE.,The peaks had winter's keenness;
8914,PRELUDE.,"And, close on autumn's frost, the vales"
8915,PRELUDE.,Had more than June's fresh greenness.
8916,PRELUDE.,
8917,PRELUDE.,Again the sodden forest floors
8918,PRELUDE.,"With golden lights were checkered,"
8919,PRELUDE.,Once more rejoicing leaves in wind
8920,PRELUDE.,And sunshine danced and flickered.
8921,PRELUDE.,
8922,PRELUDE.,It was as if the summer's late
8923,PRELUDE.,Atoning for it's sadness
8924,PRELUDE.,Had borrowed every season's charm
8925,PRELUDE.,To end its days in gladness.
8926,PRELUDE.,
8927,PRELUDE.,Rivers of gold-mist flowing down
8928,PRELUDE.,"From far celestial fountains,--"
8929,PRELUDE.,The great sun flaming through the rifts
8930,PRELUDE.,Beyond the wall of mountains.
8931,PRELUDE.,
8932,PRELUDE.,We paused at last where home-bound cows
8933,PRELUDE.,"Brought down the pasture's treasure,"
8934,PRELUDE.,And in the barn the rhythmic flails
8935,PRELUDE.,Beat out a harvest measure.
8936,PRELUDE.,
8937,PRELUDE.,"We heard the night-hawk's sullen plunge,"
8938,PRELUDE.,The crow his tree-mates calling
8939,PRELUDE.,The shadows lengthening down the slopes
8940,PRELUDE.,About our feet were falling.
8941,PRELUDE.,
8942,PRELUDE.,And through them smote the level sun
8943,PRELUDE.,"In broken lines of splendor,"
8944,PRELUDE.,Touched the gray rocks and made the green
8945,PRELUDE.,Of the shorn grass more tender.
8946,PRELUDE.,
8947,PRELUDE.,"The maples bending o'er the gate,"
8948,PRELUDE.,Their arch of leaves just tinted
8949,PRELUDE.,"With yellow warmth, the golden glow"
8950,PRELUDE.,Of coming autumn hinted.
8951,PRELUDE.,
8952,PRELUDE.,"Keen white between the farm-house showed,"
8953,PRELUDE.,"And smiled on porch and trellis,"
8954,PRELUDE.,The fair democracy of flowers
8955,PRELUDE.,That equals cot and palace.
8956,PRELUDE.,
8957,PRELUDE.,"And weaving garlands for her dog,"
8958,PRELUDE.,"'Twixt chidings and caresses,"
8959,PRELUDE.,A human flower of childhood shook
8960,PRELUDE.,The sunshine from her tresses.
8961,PRELUDE.,
8962,PRELUDE.,"Clear drawn against the hard blue sky,"
8963,PRELUDE.,The peaks had winter's keenness;
8964,PRELUDE.,"And, close on autumn's frost, the vales"
8965,PRELUDE.,Had more than June's fresh greenness.
8966,PRELUDE.,
8967,PRELUDE.,Again the sodden forest floors
8968,PRELUDE.,"With golden lights were checkered,"
8969,PRELUDE.,Once more rejoicing leaves in wind
8970,PRELUDE.,And sunshine danced and flickered.
8971,PRELUDE.,
8972,PRELUDE.,It was as if the summer's late
8973,PRELUDE.,Atoning for it's sadness
8974,PRELUDE.,Had borrowed every season's charm
8975,PRELUDE.,To end its days in gladness.
8976,PRELUDE.,
8977,PRELUDE.,I call to mind those banded vales
8978,PRELUDE.,"Of shadow and of shining,"
8979,PRELUDE.,"Through which, my hostess at my side,"
8980,PRELUDE.,I drove in day's declining.
8981,PRELUDE.,
8982,PRELUDE.,We held our sideling way above
8983,PRELUDE.,"The river's whitening shallows,"
8984,PRELUDE.,"By homesteads old, with wide-flung barns"
8985,PRELUDE.,Swept through and through by swallows;
8986,PRELUDE.,
8987,PRELUDE.,"By maple orchards, belts of pine"
8988,PRELUDE.,And larches climbing darkly
8989,PRELUDE.,"The mountain slopes, and, over all,"
8990,PRELUDE.,The great peaks rising starkly.
8991,PRELUDE.,
8992,PRELUDE.,You should have seen that long hill-range
8993,PRELUDE.,"With gaps of brightness riven,--"
8994,PRELUDE.,How through each pass and hollow streamed
8995,PRELUDE.,"The purpling lights of heaven,--"
8996,PRELUDE.,
8997,PRELUDE.,On either hand we saw the signs
8998,PRELUDE.,"Of fancy and of shrewdness,"
8999,PRELUDE.,Where taste had wound its arms of vines
9000,PRELUDE.,Round thrift's uncomely rudeness.
9001,PRELUDE.,
9002,PRELUDE.,The sun-brown farmer in his frock
9003,PRELUDE.,"Shook hands, and called to Mary"
9004,PRELUDE.,"Bare-armed, as Juno might, she came,"
9005,PRELUDE.,White-aproned from her dairy.
9006,PRELUDE.,
9007,PRELUDE.,"Her air, her smile, her motions, told"
9008,PRELUDE.,Of womanly completeness;
9009,PRELUDE.,A music as of household songs
9010,PRELUDE.,Was in her voice of sweetness.
9011,PRELUDE.,
9012,PRELUDE.,"Not fair alone in curve and line,"
9013,PRELUDE.,"But something more and better,"
9014,PRELUDE.,"The secret charm eluding art,"
9015,PRELUDE.,"Its spirit, not its letter;--"
9016,PRELUDE.,
9017,PRELUDE.,An inborn grace that nothing lacked
9018,PRELUDE.,"Of culture or appliance,"
9019,PRELUDE.,"The warmth of genial courtesy,"
9020,PRELUDE.,The calm of self-reliance.
9021,PRELUDE.,
9022,PRELUDE.,Before her queenly womanhood
9023,PRELUDE.,How dared our hostess utter
9024,PRELUDE.,The paltry errand of her need
9025,PRELUDE.,To buy her fresh-churned butter?
9026,PRELUDE.,
9027,PRELUDE.,"She led the way with housewife pride,"
9028,PRELUDE.,"Her goodly store disclosing,"
9029,PRELUDE.,Full tenderly the golden balls
9030,PRELUDE.,With practised hands disposing.
9031,PRELUDE.,
9032,PRELUDE.,"Then, while along the western hills"
9033,PRELUDE.,We watched the changeful glory
9034,PRELUDE.,"Of sunset, on our homeward way,"
9035,PRELUDE.,I heard her simple story.
9036,PRELUDE.,
9037,PRELUDE.,The early crickets sang; the stream
9038,PRELUDE.,Plashed through my friend's narration
9039,PRELUDE.,Her rustic patois of the hills
9040,PRELUDE.,Lost in my free-translation.
9041,PRELUDE.,
9042,PRELUDE.,"""More wise,"" she said, ""than those who swarm"
9043,PRELUDE.,"Our hills in middle summer,"
9044,PRELUDE.,"She came, when June's first roses blow,"
9045,PRELUDE.,To greet the early comer.
9046,PRELUDE.,
9047,PRELUDE.,"""From school and ball and rout she came,"
9048,PRELUDE.,"The city's fair, pale daughter,"
9049,PRELUDE.,To drink the wine of mountain air
9050,PRELUDE.,Beside the Bearcamp Water.
9051,PRELUDE.,
9052,PRELUDE.,"""Her step grew firmer on the hills"
9053,PRELUDE.,That watch our homesteads over;
9054,PRELUDE.,"On cheek and lip, from summer fields,"
9055,PRELUDE.,She caught the bloom of clover.
9056,PRELUDE.,
9057,PRELUDE.,"""For health comes sparkling in the streams"
9058,PRELUDE.,From cool Chocorua stealing
9059,PRELUDE.,There's iron in our Northern winds;
9060,PRELUDE.,Our pines are trees of healing.
9061,PRELUDE.,
9062,PRELUDE.,"""She sat beneath the broad-armed elms"
9063,PRELUDE.,"That skirt the mowing-meadow,"
9064,PRELUDE.,And watched the gentle west-wind weave
9065,PRELUDE.,The grass with shine and shadow.
9066,PRELUDE.,
9067,PRELUDE.,"""Beside her, from the summer heat"
9068,PRELUDE.,"To share her grateful screening,"
9069,PRELUDE.,"With forehead bared, the farmer stood,"
9070,PRELUDE.,Upon his pitchfork leaning.
9071,PRELUDE.,
9072,PRELUDE.,"""Framed in its damp, dark locks, his face"
9073,PRELUDE.,"Had nothing mean or common,--"
9074,PRELUDE.,"Strong, manly, true, the tenderness"
9075,PRELUDE.,And pride beloved of woman.
9076,PRELUDE.,
9077,PRELUDE.,"""She looked up, glowing with the health"
9078,PRELUDE.,"The country air had brought her,"
9079,PRELUDE.,"And, laughing, said: 'You lack a wife,"
9080,PRELUDE.,Your mother lacks a daughter.
9081,PRELUDE.,
9082,PRELUDE.,"""'To mend your frock and bake your bread"
9083,PRELUDE.,You do not need a lady
9084,PRELUDE.,Be sure among these brown old homes
9085,PRELUDE.,"Is some one waiting ready,--"
9086,PRELUDE.,
9087,PRELUDE.,"""'Some fair, sweet girl with skilful hand"
9088,PRELUDE.,"And cheerful heart for treasure,"
9089,PRELUDE.,"Who never played with ivory keys,"
9090,PRELUDE.,Or danced the polka's measure.'
9091,PRELUDE.,
9092,PRELUDE.,"""He bent his black brows to a frown,"
9093,PRELUDE.,He set his white teeth tightly.
9094,PRELUDE.,"''T is well,' he said, 'for one like you"
9095,PRELUDE.,To choose for me so lightly.
9096,PRELUDE.,
9097,PRELUDE.,"""You think, because my life is rude"
9098,PRELUDE.,I take no note of sweetness
9099,PRELUDE.,I tell you love has naught to do
9100,PRELUDE.,With meetness or unmeetness.
9101,PRELUDE.,
9102,PRELUDE.,"""'Itself its best excuse, it asks"
9103,PRELUDE.,No leave of pride or fashion
9104,PRELUDE.,When silken zone or homespun frock
9105,PRELUDE.,It stirs with throbs of passion.
9106,PRELUDE.,
9107,PRELUDE.,"""'You think me deaf and blind: you bring"
9108,PRELUDE.,Your winning graces hither
9109,PRELUDE.,As free as if from cradle-time
9110,PRELUDE.,We two had played together.
9111,PRELUDE.,
9112,PRELUDE.,"""'You tempt me with your laughing eyes,"
9113,PRELUDE.,"Your cheek of sundown's blushes,"
9114,PRELUDE.,"A motion as of waving grain,"
9115,PRELUDE.,A music as of thrushes.
9116,PRELUDE.,
9117,PRELUDE.,"""'The plaything of your summer sport,"
9118,PRELUDE.,The spells you weave around me
9119,PRELUDE.,"You cannot at your will undo,"
9120,PRELUDE.,Nor leave me as you found me.
9121,PRELUDE.,

10636,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,THE beginning of German emigration to America may be traced to the
10637,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"personal influence of William Penn, who in 1677 visited the Continent,"
10638,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,and made the acquaintance of an intelligent and highly cultivated circle
10639,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"of Pietists, or Mystics, who, reviving in the seventeenth century the"
10640,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"spiritual faith and worship of Tauler and the ""Friends of God"" in the"
10641,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"fourteenth, gathered about the pastor Spener, and the young and"
10642,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,beautiful Eleonora Johanna Von Merlau. In this circle originated the
10643,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Frankfort Land Company, which bought of William Penn, the Governor of"
10644,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Pennsylvania, a tract of land near the new city of Philadelphia. The"
10645,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"company's agent in the New World was a rising young lawyer, Francis"
10646,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Daniel Pastorius, son of Judge Pastorius, of Windsheim, who, at the age"
10647,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"of seventeen, entered the University of Altorf. He studied law at,"
10648,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Strasburg, Basle, and Jena, and at Ratisbon, the seat of the Imperial"
10649,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Government, obtained a practical knowledge of international polity."
10650,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Successful in all his examinations and disputations, he received the"
10651,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,degree of Doctor of Law at Nuremberg in 1676. In 1679 he was a
10652,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"law-lecturer at Frankfort, where he became deeply interested in the"
10653,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"teachings of Dr. Spener. In 1680-81 he travelled in France, England,"
10654,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Ireland, and Italy with his friend Herr Von Rodeck. ""I was,"" he says,"
10655,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"""glad to enjoy again the company of my Christian friends, rather than be"
10656,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"with Von Rodeck feasting and dancing."" In 1683, in company with a small"
10657,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"number of German Friends, he emigrated to America, settling upon the"
10658,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,Frankfort Company's tract between the Schuylkill and the Delaware
10659,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"rivers. The township was divided into four hamlets, namely, Germantown,"
10660,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Krisheim, Crefield, and Sommerhausen. Soon after his arrival he united"
10661,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"himself with the Society of Friends, and became one of its most able and"
10662,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"devoted members, as well as the recognized head and lawgiver of the"
10663,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"settlement. He married, two years after his arrival, Anneke (Anna),"
10664,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"daughter of Dr. Klosterman, of Muhlheim. In the year 1688 he drew up a"
10665,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"memorial against slaveholding, which was adopted by the Germantown"
10666,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Friends and sent up to the Monthly Meeting, and thence to the Yearly"
10667,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,Meeting at Philadelphia. It is noteworthy as the first protest made by
10668,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,a religious body against Negro Slavery. The original document was
10669,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"discovered in 1844 by the Philadelphia antiquarian, Nathan Kite, and"
10670,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,published in The Friend (Vol. XVIII. No. 16). It is a bold and direct
10671,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"appeal to the best instincts of the heart. ""Have not,"" he asks, ""these"
10672,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,negroes as much right to fight for their freedom as you have to keep
10673,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"them slaves?"" Under the wise direction of Pastorius, the German-town"
10674,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,settlement grew and prospered. The inhabitants planted orchards and
10675,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"vineyards, and surrounded themselves with souvenirs of their old home."
10676,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"A large number of them were linen-weavers, as well as small farmers."
10677,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"The Quakers were the principal sect, but men of all religions were"
10678,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"tolerated, and lived together in harmony. In 1692 Richard Frame"
10679,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"published, in what he called verse, a Description of Pennsylvania, in"
10680,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,which he alludes to the settlement:--
10681,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,
10682,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"""The German town of which I spoke before,"
10683,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Which is at least in length one mile or more,"
10684,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Where lives High German people and Low Dutch,"
10685,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Whose trade in weaving linen cloth is much,"
10686,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"--There grows the flax, as also you may know"
10687,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,That from the same they do divide the tow.
10688,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Their trade suits well their habitation,"
10689,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"We find convenience for their occupation."""
10690,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,
10691,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Pastorius seems to have been on intimate terms with William Penn, Thomas"
10692,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Lloyd, Chief Justice Logan, Thomas Story, and other leading men in the"
10693,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Province belonging to his own religious society, as also with Kelpius,"
10694,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"the learned Mystic of the Wissahickon, with the pastor of the Swedes'"
10695,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"church, and the leaders of the Mennonites. He wrote a description of"
10696,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Pennsylvania, which was published at Frankfort and Leipsic in 1700 and"
10697,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"1701. His Lives of the Saints, etc., written in German and dedicated to"
10698,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Professor Schurmberg, his old teacher, was published in 1690. He left"
10699,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,behind him many unpublished manuscripts covering a very wide range of
10700,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"subjects, most of which are now lost. One huge manuscript folio,"
10701,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"entitled Hive Beestock, Melliotropheum Alucar, or Rusca Apium, still"
10702,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"remains, containing one thousand pages with about one hundred lines to a"
10703,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"page. It is a medley of knowledge and fancy, history, philosophy, and"
10704,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"poetry, written in seven languages. A large portion of his poetry is"
10705,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"devoted to the pleasures of gardening, the description of flowers, and"
10706,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,the care of bees. The following specimen of his punning Latin is
10707,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,addressed to an orchard-pilferer:--
10708,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,
10709,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"""Quisquis in haec furtim reptas viridaria nostra"
10710,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Tangere fallaci poma caveto mane,"
10711,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Si non obsequeris faxit Deus omne quod opto,"
10712,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Cum malis nostris ut mala cuncta feras."""
10713,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,
10714,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Professor Oswald Seidensticker, to whose papers in Der Deutsche Pioneer"
10715,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"and that able periodical the Penn Monthly, of Philadelphia, I am"
10716,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,indebted for many of the foregoing facts in regard to the German
10717,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"pilgrims of the New World, thus closes his notice of Pastorius:--"
10718,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"""No tombstone, not even a record of burial, indicates where his remains"
10719,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"have found their last resting-place, and the pardonable desire to"
10720,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,associate the homage due to this distinguished man with some visible
10721,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,memento can not be gratified. There is no reason to suppose that he was
10722,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,interred in any other place than the Friends' old burying-ground in
10723,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"Germantown, though the fact is not attested by any definite source of"
10724,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"information. After all, this obliteration of the last trace of his"
10725,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,earthly existence is but typical of what has overtaken the times which
10726,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"he represents; that Germantown which he founded, which saw him live and"
10727,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"move, is at present but a quaint idyl of the past, almost a myth, barely"
10728,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,remembered and little cared for by the keener race that has succeeded.
10729,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,The Pilgrims of Plymouth have not lacked historian and poet. Justice has
10730,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"been done to their faith, courage, and self-sacrifice, and to the mighty"
10731,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,influence of their endeavors to establish righteousness on the earth.
10732,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"The Quaker pilgrims of Pennsylvania, seeking the same object by"
10733,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"different means, have not been equally fortunate. The power of their"
10734,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"testimony for truth and holiness, peace and freedom, enforced only by"
10735,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"what Milton calls ""the unresistible might of meekness,"" has been felt"
10736,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"through two centuries in the amelioration of penal severities, the"
10737,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"abolition of slavery, the reform of the erring, the relief of the poor"
10738,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"and suffering,--felt, in brief, in every step of human progress. But of"
10739,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"the men themselves, with the single exception of William Penn, scarcely"
10740,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"anything is known. Contrasted, from the outset, with the stern,"
10741,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"aggressive Puritans of New England, they have come to be regarded as"
10742,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"""a feeble folk,"" with a personality as doubtful as their unrecorded"
10743,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"graves. They were not soldiers, like Miles Standish; they had no figure"
10744,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"so picturesque as Vane, no leader so rashly brave and haughty as"
10745,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,Endicott. No Cotton Mather wrote their Magnalia; they had no awful drama
10746,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,of supernaturalism in which Satan and his angels were actors; and the
10747,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,only witch mentioned in their simple annals was a poor old Swedish
10748,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"woman, who, on complaint of her countrywomen, was tried and acquitted"
10749,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,of everything but imbecility and folly. Nothing but common-place offices
10750,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"of civility came to pass between them and the Indians; indeed, their"
10751,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,enemies taunted them with the fact that the savages did not regard them
10752,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"as Christians, but just such men as themselves. Yet it must be apparent"
10753,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,to every careful observer of the progress of American civilization that
10754,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,its two principal currents had their sources in the entirely opposite
10755,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,directions of the Puritan and Quaker colonies. To use the words of a
10756,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"late writer: ""The historical forces, with which no others may be"
10757,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"compared in their influence on the people, have been those of the"
10758,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,Puritan and the Quaker. The strength of the one was in the confession of
10759,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"an invisible Presence, a righteous, eternal Will, which would establish"
10760,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,righteousness on earth; and thence arose the conviction of a direct
10761,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"personal responsibility, which could be tempted by no external splendor"
10762,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"and could be shaken by no internal agitation, and could not be evaded or"
10763,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,transferred. The strength of the other was the witness in the human
10764,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"spirit to an eternal Word, an Inner Voice which spoke to each alone,"
10765,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"while yet it spoke to every man; a Light which each was to follow, and"
10766,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,which yet was the light of the world; and all other voices were silent
10767,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"before this, and the solitary path whither it led was more sacred than"
10768,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"the worn ways of cathedral-aisles."" It will be sufficiently apparent to"
10769,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"the reader that, in the poem which follows, I have attempted nothing"
10770,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"beyond a study of the life and times of the Pennsylvania colonist,--a"
10771,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,simple picture of a noteworthy man and his locality. The colors of my
10772,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"sketch are all very sober, toned down to the quiet and dreamy atmosphere"
10773,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"through which its subject is visible. Whether, in the glare and tumult"
10774,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"of the present time, such a picture will find favor may well be"
10775,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,questioned. I only know that it has beguiled for me some hours of
10776,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,"weariness, and that, whatever may be its measure of public appreciation,"
10777,INTRODUCTORY NOTE.,it has been to me its own reward.

10813,PRELUDE.,I SING the Pilgrim of a softer clime
10814,PRELUDE.,And milder speech than those brave men's who brought
10815,PRELUDE.,To the ice and iron of our winter time
10816,PRELUDE.,"A will as firm, a creed as stern, and wrought"
10817,PRELUDE.,"With one mailed hand, and with the other fought."
10818,PRELUDE.,"Simply, as fits my theme, in homely rhyme"
10819,PRELUDE.,"I sing the blue-eyed German Spener taught,"
10820,PRELUDE.,"Through whose veiled, mystic faith the Inward Light,"
10821,PRELUDE.,"Steady and still, an easy brightness, shone,"
10822,PRELUDE.,Transfiguring all things in its radiance white.
10823,PRELUDE.,The garland which his meekness never sought
10824,PRELUDE.,I bring him; over fields of harvest sown
10825,PRELUDE.,"With seeds of blessing, now to ripeness grown,"
10826,PRELUDE.,I bid the sower pass before the reapers' sight.

10830,PRELUDE.,Never in tenderer quiet lapsed the day
10831,PRELUDE.,"From Pennsylvania's vales of spring away,"
10832,PRELUDE.,"Where, forest-walled, the scattered hamlets lay"
10833,PRELUDE.,
10834,PRELUDE.,Along the wedded rivers. One long bar
10835,PRELUDE.,"Of purple cloud, on which the evening star"
10836,PRELUDE.,"Shone like a jewel on a scimitar,"
10837,PRELUDE.,
10838,PRELUDE.,Held the sky's golden gateway. Through the deep
10839,PRELUDE.,"Hush of the woods a murmur seemed to creep,"
10840,PRELUDE.,The Schuylkill whispering in a voice of sleep.
10841,PRELUDE.,
10842,PRELUDE.,All else was still. The oxen from their ploughs
10843,PRELUDE.,"Rested at last, and from their long day's browse"
10844,PRELUDE.,Came the dun files of Krisheim's home-bound cows.
10845,PRELUDE.,
10846,PRELUDE.,"And the young city, round whose virgin zone"
10847,PRELUDE.,"The rivers like two mighty arms were thrown,"
10848,PRELUDE.,"Marked by the smoke of evening fires alone,"
10849,PRELUDE.,
10850,PRELUDE.,"Lay in the distance, lovely even then"
10851,PRELUDE.,With its fair women and its stately men
10852,PRELUDE.,"Gracing the forest court of William Penn,"
10853,PRELUDE.,
10854,PRELUDE.,Urban yet sylvan; in its rough-hewn frames
10855,PRELUDE.,"Of oak and pine the dryads held their claims,"
10856,PRELUDE.,And lent its streets their pleasant woodland names.
10857,PRELUDE.,
10858,PRELUDE.,Anna Pastorius down the leafy lane
10859,PRELUDE.,"Looked city-ward, then stooped to prune again"
10860,PRELUDE.,"Her vines and simples, with a sigh of pain."
10861,PRELUDE.,
10862,PRELUDE.,For fast the streaks of ruddy sunset paled
10863,PRELUDE.,"In the oak clearing, and, as daylight failed,"
10864,PRELUDE.,"Slow, overhead, the dusky night-birds sailed."
10865,PRELUDE.,
10866,PRELUDE.,"Again she looked: between green walls of shade,"
10867,PRELUDE.,"With low-bent head as if with sorrow weighed,"
10868,PRELUDE.,"Daniel Pastorius slowly came and said,"
10869,PRELUDE.,
10870,PRELUDE.,"""God's peace be with thee, Anna!"" Then he stood"
10871,PRELUDE.,"Silent before her, wrestling with the mood"
10872,PRELUDE.,Of one who sees the evil and not good.
10873,PRELUDE.,
10874,PRELUDE.,"""What is it, my Pastorius?"" As she spoke,"
10875,PRELUDE.,"A slow, faint smile across his features broke,"
10876,PRELUDE.,"Sadder than tears. ""Dear heart,"" he said, ""our folk"
10877,PRELUDE.,
10878,PRELUDE.,"""Are even as others. Yea, our goodliest Friends"
10879,PRELUDE.,"Are frail; our elders have their selfish ends,"

10882,PRELUDE.,"""For duty's loss. So even our feeble word"
10883,PRELUDE.,For the dumb slaves the startled meeting heard
10884,PRELUDE.,As if a stone its quiet waters stirred;
10885,PRELUDE.,
10886,PRELUDE.,"""And, as the clerk ceased reading, there began"
10887,PRELUDE.,A ripple of dissent which downward ran
10888,PRELUDE.,"In widening circles, as from man to man."
10889,PRELUDE.,
10890,PRELUDE.,"""Somewhat was said of running before sent,"
10891,PRELUDE.,"Of tender fear that some their guide outwent,"
10892,PRELUDE.,Troublers of Israel. I was scarce intent

10894,PRELUDE.,"""On hearing, for behind the reverend row"
10895,PRELUDE.,"Of gallery Friends, in dumb and piteous show,"
10896,PRELUDE.,"I saw, methought, dark faces full of woe."
10897,PRELUDE.,
10898,PRELUDE.,"""And, in the spirit, I was taken where"
10899,PRELUDE.,They toiled and suffered; I was made aware
10900,PRELUDE.,Of shame and wrath and anguish and despair!
10901,PRELUDE.,
10902,PRELUDE.,"""And while the meeting smothered our poor plea"
10903,PRELUDE.,"With cautious phrase, a Voice there seemed to be,"
10904,PRELUDE.,As ye have done to these ye do to me!'
10905,PRELUDE.,
10906,PRELUDE.,"""So it all passed; and the old tithe went on"
10907,PRELUDE.,"Of anise, mint, and cumin, till the sun"
10908,PRELUDE.,"Set, leaving still the weightier work undone."
10909,PRELUDE.,
10910,PRELUDE.,"""Help, for the good man faileth! Who is strong,"

10913,PRELUDE.,
10914,PRELUDE.,"He ceased; and, bound in spirit with the bound,"
10915,PRELUDE.,"With folded arms, and eyes that sought the ground,"
10916,PRELUDE.,Walked musingly his little garden round.
10917,PRELUDE.,
10918,PRELUDE.,"About him, beaded with the falling dew,"
10919,PRELUDE.,"Rare plants of power and herbs of healing grew,"
10920,PRELUDE.,Such as Van Helmont and Agrippa knew.
10921,PRELUDE.,
10922,PRELUDE.,"For, by the lore of Gorlitz' gentle sage,"
10923,PRELUDE.,With the mild mystics of his dreamy age
10924,PRELUDE.,"He read the herbal signs of nature's page,"
10925,PRELUDE.,
10926,PRELUDE.,As once he heard in sweet Von Merlau's' bowers
10927,PRELUDE.,"Fair as herself, in boyhood's happy hours,"

10929,PRELUDE.,

10941,PRELUDE.,
10942,PRELUDE.,"""But some time, thou hast told me, there shall come"

10986,PRELUDE.,"Of flaxen webs, and on the table, bare"
10987,PRELUDE.,"Of costly cloth or silver cup, but where,"

10990,PRELUDE.,"The courtly Penn had praised the goodwife's cheer,"
10991,PRELUDE.,"And quoted Horace o'er her home brewed beer,"

10993,PRELUDE.,
10994,PRELUDE.,"In such a home, beside the Schuylkill's wave,"
10995,PRELUDE.,"He dwelt in peace with God and man, and gave"

11010,PRELUDE.,In God's name; and the leaven of the word

11017,PRELUDE.,
11018,PRELUDE.,"Gravely Pastorius listened, not the less"

11022,PRELUDE.,"One Scripture rule, at least, was unforgot;"

11202,PRELUDE.,"Of verse, Dutch, English, Latin, like the hash"
11203,PRELUDE.,Of corn and beans in Indian succotash;
11204,PRELUDE.,"Dull, doubtless, but with here and there a flash"
11205,PRELUDE.,
11206,PRELUDE.,"Of wit and fine conceit,--the good man's play"
11207,PRELUDE.,"Of quiet fancies, meet to while away"
11208,PRELUDE.,The slow hours measuring off an idle day.
11209,PRELUDE.,
11210,PRELUDE.,"At evening, while his wife put on her look"
11211,PRELUDE.,"Of love's endurance, from its niche he took"
11212,PRELUDE.,The written pages of his ponderous book.
11213,PRELUDE.,
11214,PRELUDE.,"And read, in half the languages of man,"
11215,PRELUDE.,"His ""Rusca Apium,"" which with bees began,"
11216,PRELUDE.,And through the gamut of creation ran.
11217,PRELUDE.,
11218,PRELUDE.,"Or, now and then, the missive of some friend"
11219,PRELUDE.,In gray Altorf or storied Nurnberg penned
11220,PRELUDE.,Dropped in upon him like a guest to spend
11221,PRELUDE.,
11222,PRELUDE.,The night beneath his roof-tree. Mystical
11223,PRELUDE.,The fair Von Merlau spake as waters fall
11224,PRELUDE.,"And voices sound in dreams, and yet withal"
11225,PRELUDE.,
11226,PRELUDE.,"Human and sweet, as if each far, low tone,"
11227,PRELUDE.,Over the roses of her gardens blown
11228,PRELUDE.,Brought the warm sense of beauty all her own.
11229,PRELUDE.,
11230,PRELUDE.,Wise Spener questioned what his friend could trace
11231,PRELUDE.,Of spiritual influx or of saving grace
11232,PRELUDE.,In the wild natures of the Indian race.
11233,PRELUDE.,
11234,PRELUDE.,"And learned Schurmberg, fain, at times, to look"
11235,PRELUDE.,"From Talmud, Koran, Veds, and Pentateuch,"
11236,PRELUDE.,"Sought out his pupil in his far-off nook,"
11237,PRELUDE.,
11238,PRELUDE.,"To query with him of climatic change,"
11239,PRELUDE.,"Of bird, beast, reptile, in his forest range,"
11240,PRELUDE.,Of flowers and fruits and simples new and strange.
11241,PRELUDE.,
11242,PRELUDE.,And thus the Old and New World reached their hands
11243,PRELUDE.,"Across the water, and the friendly lands"
11244,PRELUDE.,Talked with each other from their severed strands.
11245,PRELUDE.,
11246,PRELUDE.,Pastorius answered all: while seed and root
11247,PRELUDE.,Sent from his new home grew to flower and fruit
11248,PRELUDE.,Along the Rhine and at the Spessart's foot;
11249,PRELUDE.,
11250,PRELUDE.,"And, in return, the flowers his boyhood knew"
11251,PRELUDE.,"Smiled at his door, the same in form and hue,"
11252,PRELUDE.,And on his vines the Rhenish clusters grew.
11253,PRELUDE.,
11254,PRELUDE.,"No idler he; whoever else might shirk,"
11255,PRELUDE.,"He set his hand to every honest work,--"
11256,PRELUDE.,"Farmer and teacher, court and meeting clerk."
11257,PRELUDE.,
11258,PRELUDE.,"Still on the town seal his device is found,"
11259,PRELUDE.,"Grapes, flax, and thread-spool on a trefoil ground,"
11260,PRELUDE.,"With ""Vinum, Linum et Textrinum"" wound."
11261,PRELUDE.,
11262,PRELUDE.,"One house sufficed for gospel and for law,"
11263,PRELUDE.,"Where Paul and Grotius, Scripture text and saw,"
11264,PRELUDE.,"Assured the good, and held the rest in awe."
11265,PRELUDE.,
11266,PRELUDE.,"Whatever legal maze he wandered through,"
11267,PRELUDE.,"He kept the Sermon on the Mount in view,"
11268,PRELUDE.,And justice always into mercy grew.
11269,PRELUDE.,
11270,PRELUDE.,"No whipping-post he needed, stocks, nor jail,"
11271,PRELUDE.,Nor ducking-stool; the orchard-thief grew pale
11272,PRELUDE.,"At his rebuke, the vixen ceased to rail,"
11273,PRELUDE.,
11274,PRELUDE.,The usurer's grasp released the forfeit land;
11275,PRELUDE.,"The slanderer faltered at the witness-stand,"
11276,PRELUDE.,And all men took his counsel for command.
11277,PRELUDE.,
11278,PRELUDE.,"Was it caressing air, the brooding love"
11279,PRELUDE.,"Of tenderer skies than German land knew of,"
11280,PRELUDE.,"Green calm below, blue quietness above,"
11281,PRELUDE.,
11282,PRELUDE.,"Still flow of water, deep repose of wood"
11283,PRELUDE.,"That, with a sense of loving Fatherhood"
11284,PRELUDE.,"And childlike trust in the Eternal Good,"
11285,PRELUDE.,
11286,PRELUDE.,"Softened all hearts, and dulled the edge of hate,"
11287,PRELUDE.,"Hushed strife, and taught impatient zeal to wait"
11288,PRELUDE.,The slow assurance of the better state?
11289,PRELUDE.,
11290,PRELUDE.,Who knows what goadings in their sterner way
11291,PRELUDE.,"O'er jagged ice, relieved by granite gray,"
11292,PRELUDE.,Blew round the men of Massachusetts Bay?
11293,PRELUDE.,
11294,PRELUDE.,What hate of heresy the east-wind woke?
11295,PRELUDE.,What hints of pitiless power and terror spoke
11296,PRELUDE.,In waves that on their iron coast-line broke?
11297,PRELUDE.,
11298,PRELUDE.,Be it as it may: within the Land of Penn
11299,PRELUDE.,"The sectary yielded to the citizen,"
11300,PRELUDE.,And peaceful dwelt the many-creeded men.
11301,PRELUDE.,
11302,PRELUDE.,Peace brooded over all. No trumpet stung
11303,PRELUDE.,"The air to madness, and no steeple flung"
11304,PRELUDE.,Alarums down from bells at midnight rung.
11305,PRELUDE.,
11306,PRELUDE.,The land slept well. The Indian from his face
11307,PRELUDE.,"Washed all his war-paint off, and in the place"
11308,PRELUDE.,"Of battle-marches sped the peaceful chase,"
11309,PRELUDE.,
11310,PRELUDE.,"Or wrought for wages at the white man's side,--"
11311,PRELUDE.,Giving to kindness what his native pride
11312,PRELUDE.,And lazy freedom to all else denied.
11313,PRELUDE.,
11314,PRELUDE.,And well the curious scholar loved the old
11315,PRELUDE.,Traditions that his swarthy neighbors told
11316,PRELUDE.,"By wigwam-fires when nights were growing cold,"
11317,PRELUDE.,
11318,PRELUDE.,Discerned the fact round which their fancy drew
11319,PRELUDE.,"Its dreams, and held their childish faith more true"
11320,PRELUDE.,To God and man than half the creeds he knew.
11321,PRELUDE.,
11322,PRELUDE.,The desert blossomed round him; wheat-fields rolled
11323,PRELUDE.,Beneath the warm wind waves of green and gold;
11324,PRELUDE.,The planted ear returned its hundred-fold.
11325,PRELUDE.,
11326,PRELUDE.,Great clusters ripened in a warmer sun
11327,PRELUDE.,Than that which by the Rhine stream shines upon
11328,PRELUDE.,The purpling hillsides with low vines o'errun.
11329,PRELUDE.,
11330,PRELUDE.,About each rustic porch the humming-bird
11331,PRELUDE.,"Tried with light bill, that scarce a petal stirred,"
11332,PRELUDE.,The Old World flowers to virgin soil transferred;
11333,PRELUDE.,
11334,PRELUDE.,"And the first-fruits of pear and apple, bending"
11335,PRELUDE.,"The young boughs down, their gold and russet blending,"
11336,PRELUDE.,"Made glad his heart, familiar odors lending"
11337,PRELUDE.,
11338,PRELUDE.,"To the fresh fragrance of the birch and pine,"
11339,PRELUDE.,"Life-everlasting, bay, and eglantine,"
11340,PRELUDE.,And all the subtle scents the woods combine.
11341,PRELUDE.,
11342,PRELUDE.,"Fair First-Day mornings, steeped in summer calm,"
11343,PRELUDE.,"Warm, tender, restful, sweet with woodland balm,"
11344,PRELUDE.,"Came to him, like some mother-hallowed psalm"
11345,PRELUDE.,
11346,PRELUDE.,To the tired grinder at the noisy wheel
11347,PRELUDE.,"Of labor, winding off from memory's reel"
11348,PRELUDE.,A golden thread of music. With no peal
11349,PRELUDE.,
11350,PRELUDE.,"Of bells to call them to the house of praise,"
11351,PRELUDE.,The scattered settlers through green forest-ways
11352,PRELUDE.,Walked meeting-ward. In reverent amaze
11353,PRELUDE.,
11354,PRELUDE.,"The Indian trapper saw them, from the dim"
11355,PRELUDE.,"Shade of the alders on the rivulet's rim,"
11356,PRELUDE.,Seek the Great Spirit's house to talk with Him.
11357,PRELUDE.,
11358,PRELUDE.,"There, through the gathered stillness multiplied"
11359,PRELUDE.,"And made intense by sympathy, outside"
11360,PRELUDE.,"The sparrows sang, and the gold-robin cried,"
11361,PRELUDE.,
11362,PRELUDE.,A-swing upon his elm. A faint perfume
11363,PRELUDE.,Breathed through the open windows of the room
11364,PRELUDE.,"From locust-trees, heavy with clustered bloom."
11365,PRELUDE.,
11366,PRELUDE.,"Thither, perchance, sore-tried confessors came,"
11367,PRELUDE.,"Whose fervor jail nor pillory could tame,"
11368,PRELUDE.,"Proud of the cropped ears meant to be their shame,"
11369,PRELUDE.,
11370,PRELUDE.,Men who had eaten slavery's bitter bread
11371,PRELUDE.,In Indian isles; pale women who had bled
11372,PRELUDE.,"Under the hangman's lash, and bravely said"
11373,PRELUDE.,
11374,PRELUDE.,God's message through their prison's iron bars;
11375,PRELUDE.,"And gray old soldier-converts, seamed with scars"
11376,PRELUDE.,From every stricken field of England's wars.
11377,PRELUDE.,
11378,PRELUDE.,Lowly before the Unseen Presence knelt
11379,PRELUDE.,"Each waiting heart, till haply some one felt"
11380,PRELUDE.,On his moved lips the seal of silence melt.
11381,PRELUDE.,
11382,PRELUDE.,"Or, without spoken words, low breathings stole"
11383,PRELUDE.,"Of a diviner life from soul to soul,"
11384,PRELUDE.,Baptizing in one tender thought the whole.
11385,PRELUDE.,
11386,PRELUDE.,"When shaken hands announced the meeting o'er,"
11387,PRELUDE.,"The friendly group still lingered at the door,"
11388,PRELUDE.,"Greeting, inquiring, sharing all the store"
11389,PRELUDE.,
11390,PRELUDE.,Of weekly tidings. Meanwhile youth and maid
11391,PRELUDE.,"Down the green vistas of the woodland strayed,"
11392,PRELUDE.,Whispered and smiled and oft their feet delayed.
11393,PRELUDE.,
11394,PRELUDE.,Did the boy's whistle answer back the thrushes?
11395,PRELUDE.,"Did light girl laughter ripple through the bushes,"
11396,PRELUDE.,As brooks make merry over roots and rushes?
11397,PRELUDE.,
11398,PRELUDE.,Unvexed the sweet air seemed. Without a wound
11399,PRELUDE.,"The ear of silence heard, and every sound"
11400,PRELUDE.,Its place in nature's fine accordance found.
11401,PRELUDE.,
11402,PRELUDE.,"And solemn meeting, summer sky and wood,"
11403,PRELUDE.,"Old kindly faces, youth and maidenhood"
11404,PRELUDE.,"Seemed, like God's new creation, very good!"
11405,PRELUDE.,
11406,PRELUDE.,"And, greeting all with quiet smile and word,"
11407,PRELUDE.,Pastorius went his way. The unscared bird
11408,PRELUDE.,Sang at his side; scarcely the squirrel stirred
11409,PRELUDE.,
11410,PRELUDE.,At his hushed footstep on the mossy sod;
11411,PRELUDE.,"And, wheresoe'er the good man looked or trod,"
11412,PRELUDE.,He felt the peace of nature and of God.
11413,PRELUDE.,
11414,PRELUDE.,"His social life wore no ascetic form,"
11415,PRELUDE.,"He loved all beauty, without fear of harm,"
11416,PRELUDE.,And in his veins his Teuton blood ran warm.
11417,PRELUDE.,
11418,PRELUDE.,"Strict to himself, of other men no spy,"
11419,PRELUDE.,He made his own no circuit-judge to try
11420,PRELUDE.,The freer conscience of his neighbors by.
11421,PRELUDE.,
11422,PRELUDE.,"With love rebuking, by his life alone,"
11423,PRELUDE.,"Gracious and sweet, the better way was shown,"
11424,PRELUDE.,"The joy of one, who, seeking not his own,"
11425,PRELUDE.,
11426,PRELUDE.,"And faithful to all scruples, finds at last"
11427,PRELUDE.,"The thorns and shards of duty overpast,"
11428,PRELUDE.,"And daily life, beyond his hope's forecast,"
11429,PRELUDE.,
11430,PRELUDE.,"Pleasant and beautiful with sight and sound,"
11431,PRELUDE.,"And flowers upspringing in its narrow round,"
11432,PRELUDE.,And all his days with quiet gladness crowned.
11433,PRELUDE.,
11434,PRELUDE.,"He sang not; but, if sometimes tempted strong,"
11435,PRELUDE.,He hummed what seemed like Altorf's Burschen-song;
11436,PRELUDE.,"His good wife smiled, and did not count it wrong."
11437,PRELUDE.,
11438,PRELUDE.,For well he loved his boyhood's brother band;
11439,PRELUDE.,"His Memory, while he trod the New World's strand,"
11440,PRELUDE.,A double-ganger walked the Fatherland!
11441,PRELUDE.,
11442,PRELUDE.,"If, when on frosty Christmas eves the light"
11443,PRELUDE.,"Shone on his quiet hearth, he missed the sight"
11444,PRELUDE.,"Of Yule-log, Tree, and Christ-child all in white;"
11445,PRELUDE.,
11446,PRELUDE.,"And closed his eyes, and listened to the sweet"
11447,PRELUDE.,"Old wait-songs sounding down his native street,"
11448,PRELUDE.,And watched again the dancers' mingling feet;
11449,PRELUDE.,
11450,PRELUDE.,"Yet not the less, when once the vision passed,"
11451,PRELUDE.,He held the plain and sober maxims fast
11452,PRELUDE.,Of the dear Friends with whom his lot was cast.
11453,PRELUDE.,
11454,PRELUDE.,"Still all attuned to nature's melodies,"
11455,PRELUDE.,"He loved the bird's song in his dooryard trees,"
11456,PRELUDE.,And the low hum of home-returning bees;
11457,PRELUDE.,
11458,PRELUDE.,"The blossomed flax, the tulip-trees in bloom"
11459,PRELUDE.,"Down the long street, the beauty and perfume"
11460,PRELUDE.,"Of apple-boughs, the mingling light and gloom"
11461,PRELUDE.,
11462,PRELUDE.,"Of Sommerhausen's woodlands, woven through"
11463,PRELUDE.,"With sun--threads; and the music the wind drew,"
11464,PRELUDE.,"Mournful and sweet, from leaves it overblew."
11465,PRELUDE.,
11466,PRELUDE.,"And evermore, beneath this outward sense,"
11467,PRELUDE.,"And through the common sequence of events,"
11468,PRELUDE.,He felt the guiding hand of Providence
11469,PRELUDE.,
11470,PRELUDE.,"Reach out of space. A Voice spake in his ear,"
11471,PRELUDE.,And to all other voices far and near
11472,PRELUDE.,"Died at that whisper, full of meanings clear."
11473,PRELUDE.,
11474,PRELUDE.,The Light of Life shone round him; one by one
11475,PRELUDE.,"The wandering lights, that all-misleading run,"
11476,PRELUDE.,Went out like candles paling in the sun.
11477,PRELUDE.,
11478,PRELUDE.,"That Light he followed, step by step, where'er"
11479,PRELUDE.,"It led, as in the vision of the seer"
11480,PRELUDE.,The wheels moved as the spirit in the clear
11481,PRELUDE.,
11482,PRELUDE.,"And terrible crystal moved, with all their eyes"
11483,PRELUDE.,"Watching the living splendor sink or rise,"
11484,PRELUDE.,"Its will their will, knowing no otherwise."
11485,PRELUDE.,
11486,PRELUDE.,"Within himself he found the law of right,"
11487,PRELUDE.,"He walked by faith and not the letter's sight,"
11488,PRELUDE.,And read his Bible by the Inward Light.
11489,PRELUDE.,
11490,PRELUDE.,"And if sometimes the slaves of form and rule,"
11491,PRELUDE.,"Frozen in their creeds like fish in winter's pool,"
11492,PRELUDE.,"Tried the large tolerance of his liberal school,"
11493,PRELUDE.,
11494,PRELUDE.,"His door was free to men of every name,"
11495,PRELUDE.,"He welcomed all the seeking souls who came,"
11496,PRELUDE.,And no man's faith he made a cause of blame.
11497,PRELUDE.,
11498,PRELUDE.,But best he loved in leisure hours to see
11499,PRELUDE.,"His own dear Friends sit by him knee to knee,"
11500,PRELUDE.,"In social converse, genial, frank, and free."
11501,PRELUDE.,
11502,PRELUDE.,There sometimes silence (it were hard to tell
11503,PRELUDE.,"Who owned it first) upon the circle fell,"
11504,PRELUDE.,"Hushed Anna's busy wheel, and laid its spell"
11505,PRELUDE.,
11506,PRELUDE.,"On the black boy who grimaced by the hearth,"
11507,PRELUDE.,To solemnize his shining face of mirth;
11508,PRELUDE.,Only the old clock ticked amidst the dearth
11509,PRELUDE.,
11510,PRELUDE.,Of sound; nor eye was raised nor hand was stirred
11511,PRELUDE.,"In that soul-sabbath, till at last some word"
11512,PRELUDE.,Of tender counsel or low prayer was heard.
11513,PRELUDE.,
11514,PRELUDE.,"Then guests, who lingered but farewell to say"
11515,PRELUDE.,"And take love's message, went their homeward way;"
11516,PRELUDE.,So passed in peace the guileless Quaker's day.
11517,PRELUDE.,
11518,PRELUDE.,"His was the Christian's unsung Age of Gold,"
11519,PRELUDE.,A truer idyl than the bards have told
11520,PRELUDE.,Of Arno's banks or Arcady of old.
11521,PRELUDE.,
11522,PRELUDE.,"Where still the Friends their place of burial keep,"
11523,PRELUDE.,"And century-rooted mosses o'er it creep,"
11524,PRELUDE.,The Nurnberg scholar and his helpmeet sleep.
11525,PRELUDE.,
11526,PRELUDE.,And Anna's aloe? If it flowered at last
11527,PRELUDE.,"In Bartram's garden, did John Woolman cast"
11528,PRELUDE.,A glance upon it as he meekly passed?
11529,PRELUDE.,
11530,PRELUDE.,And did a secret sympathy possess
11531,PRELUDE.,"That tender soul, and for the slave's redress"
11532,PRELUDE.,"Lend hope, strength, patience? It were vain to"
11533,PRELUDE.,guess.
11534,PRELUDE.,
11535,PRELUDE.,"Nay, were the plant itself but mythical,"
11536,PRELUDE.,Set in the fresco of tradition's wall
11537,PRELUDE.,"Like Jotham's bramble, mattereth not at all."
11538,PRELUDE.,
11539,PRELUDE.,"Enough to know that, through the winter's frost"
11540,PRELUDE.,"And summer's heat, no seed of truth is lost,"
11541,PRELUDE.,And every duty pays at last its cost.
11542,PRELUDE.,
11543,PRELUDE.,"For, ere Pastorius left the sun and air,"
11544,PRELUDE.,God sent the answer to his life-long prayer;
11545,PRELUDE.,"The child was born beside the Delaware,"
11546,PRELUDE.,
11547,PRELUDE.,"Who, in the power a holy purpose lends,"
11548,PRELUDE.,"Guided his people unto nobler ends,"
11549,PRELUDE.,And left them worthier of the name of Friends.
11550,PRELUDE.,
11551,PRELUDE.,"And to! the fulness of the time has come,"
11552,PRELUDE.,"And over all the exile's Western home,"
11553,PRELUDE.,From sea to sea the flowers of freedom bloom!
11554,PRELUDE.,
11555,PRELUDE.,"And joy-bells ring, and silver trumpets blow;"
11556,PRELUDE.,"But not for thee, Pastorius! Even so"
11557,PRELUDE.,"The world forgets, but the wise angels know."
