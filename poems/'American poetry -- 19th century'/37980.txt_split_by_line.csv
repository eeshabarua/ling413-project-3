75,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
76,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
77,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
78,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
79,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"The expression of serious and tender thoughtfulness, which always"
80,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"characterized the quiet face of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, had deepened"
81,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"during his later years, into something akin to melancholy. The tragic"
82,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"loss of his beloved wife,--burned to death while she was sealing up in"
83,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"paper little locks of her children's hair,--had left its permanent and"
84,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"irrevocable mark upon his life. Still, he did not seclude himself with"
85,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,his sorrow: the professor of Modern Languages at Harvard could hardly
86,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"do that. He remained the selfsame kindly, gentle, industrious man,"
87,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,welcoming with ready courtesy the innumerable visitors to the Craigie
88,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,House.
89,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
90,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"This is a large old-fashioned house in Cambridge, Massachusetts--a place"
91,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"of grassy terraces, long verandahs, lilac bushes, and shady trees--a"
92,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"perfect dwelling for a man of cultured tastes, as the interior also"
93,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,testifies.
94,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
95,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"From the Poet's study, a spacious, sunny room upon the ground floor,"
96,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,he could look across the meadows behind the house to the distant
97,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,silver windings of the River Charles. It was a most orderly room.
98,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Every book and paper lay where he could put his hand on it in a moment.
99,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Book-cases full of valuable volumes--precious first editions--busts and
100,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"portraits,--were to be seen on every side. A certain austere simplicity"
101,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"was noticeable all over Longfellow's house. ""His private rooms,"" it has"
102,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"been said, ""were like those of a German professor."" But the attractiveness"
103,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,and delightfulness of Craigie House arose not from any intrinsic
104,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"opulence of its contents, but from the personality of the man who lived"
105,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"there. ""By his mere presence he rendered the sunshine brighter, and the"
106,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"place more radiant of kindness and peace."""
107,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
108,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"The Poet began his day, so long as age and health permitted, by a brisk"
109,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"morning walk. He would be out and about by six, observing and enjoying"
110,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"the beauty of earth and air, and subsequently recording his exquisite"
111,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,impressions:
112,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
113,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,O Gift of God! O perfect day:
114,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Whereon shall no man work, but play;"
115,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Whereon it is enough for me,"
116,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Not to be doing, but to be!"
117,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
118,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Through every fibre of my brain,"
119,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Through every nerve, through every vein,"
120,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"I feel the electric thrill, the touch"
121,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Of life, that seems almost too much."
122,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
123,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,I hear the wind among the trees
124,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Playing celestial symphonies;
125,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"I see the branches downward bent,"
126,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Like keys of some great instrument.
127,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
128,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And over me unrolls on high
129,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"The splendid scenery of the sky,"
130,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Where through a sapphire sea the sun
131,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Sails like a golden galleon,"
132,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
133,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Towards yonder cloud-land in the West,"
134,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Towards yonder Islands of the Blest,"
135,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Whose steep sierra far uplifts
136,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Its craggy summits white with drifts.
137,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
138,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Blow, winds! and waft through all the rooms"
139,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The snowflakes of the cherry-blooms!
140,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Blow, winds! and bend within my reach"
141,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The fiery blossoms of the peach!
142,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
143,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,O Life and Love! O happy throng
144,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Of thoughts, whose only speech is song!"
145,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,O heart of man! canst thou not be
146,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Blithe as the air is, and as free?"
147,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,_A Day of Sunshine._
148,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
149,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The morning's post brought the first consignment of that enormous number
150,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,of epistles which were at once an affliction and an amusement to him.
151,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"The Poet was besieged by letters from ambitious aspirants seeking advice,"
152,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"and from self-styled failures, desirous of help. To these last he was"
153,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"peculiarly drawn, for he was distinguished by ""a grace almost peculiar"
154,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,to himself at the time in which he lived--his tenderness towards the
155,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"undeveloped artist, struggling towards individual expression."" In short,"
156,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"his first desire was to help on people, and bring out the best in them."
157,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
158,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Of apparent failure or success he recked little, believing, like"
159,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Stevenson, that the true success is labour,--that pursuit, and not"
160,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,attainment is the worthiest object of existence; and his philosophy is
161,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"summed up in the well-known words of _The Ladder of Saint Augustine_,"
162,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
163,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
164,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Saint Augustine! well hast thou said,"
165,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,That of our vices we can frame
166,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"A ladder, if we will but tread"
167,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Beneath our feet each deed of shame!
168,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
169,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"All common things, each day's events,"
170,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"That with the hour begin and end,"
171,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Our pleasures and our discontents,"
172,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Are rounds by which we may ascend.
173,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
174,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,*       *       *       *       *
175,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
176,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The longing for ignoble things;
177,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The strife for triumph more than truth;
178,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"The hardening of the heart, that brings"
179,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Irreverence for the dreams of youth;
180,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
181,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"All thoughts of ill; all evil deeds,"
182,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,That have their root in thoughts of ill;
183,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Whatever hinders or impedes
184,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The action of the nobler will;--
185,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
186,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,All these must first be trampled down
187,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Beneath our feet, if we would gain"
188,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,In the bright fields of fair renown
189,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The right of eminent domain.
190,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
191,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"We have not wings, we cannot soar;"
192,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,But we have feet to scale and climb
193,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"By slow degrees, by more and more,"
194,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The cloudy summits of our time.
195,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
196,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The mighty pyramids of stone
197,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"That wedge-like cleave the desert airs,"
198,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"When nearer seen and better known,"
199,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Are but gigantic flights of stairs.
200,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
201,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The distant mountains that uprear
202,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Their solid bastions to the skies,"
203,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Are crossed by pathways, that appear"
204,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,As we to higher levels rise.
205,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
206,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The heights by great men reached and kept
207,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Were not attained by sudden flight,"
208,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"But they, while their companions slept,"
209,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Were toiling upward in the night.
210,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
211,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Standing on what too long we bore
212,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"With shoulders bent and downcast eyes,"
213,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,We may discern--unseen before--
214,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,A path to higher destinies.
215,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
216,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Nor deem the irrevocable Past
217,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"As wholly wasted, wholly vain,"
218,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"If rising on its wrecks, at last"
219,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,To something nobler we attain.
220,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
221,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
222,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Constant requests for autographs formed the bulk of the day's budget,"
223,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,and these also never went unanswered--even when couched in terms the
224,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"most _mal à propos_, much as those of the man who said that ""he"
225,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"loved poetry in 'most any style,""--""and would you please copy your"
226,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"'Break, break, break' for the writer?"" Possibly the worst offenders, in"
227,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"this matter of autograph-hunting, were those multitudinous schoolgirls"
228,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"of whom Longfellow humorously complained that he was always ""kept busy"
229,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"answering."" They ignored the fact of his professional duties, and his"
230,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,own unremitting work; anything to get a reply in the handwriting of the
231,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"celebrity! But he had a special delight in budding womanhood, and had"
232,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"depicted it with magical insight and rare delicacy of touch, in lines"
233,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,which have never been excelled in their charm and purity.
234,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
235,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
236,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Maiden! with the meek, brown eyes"
237,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"In whose orbs a shadow lies,"
238,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Like the dusk in evening skies!
239,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
240,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Thou whose locks outshine the sun,"
241,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Golden tresses, wreathed in one,"
242,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,As the braided streamlets run!
243,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
244,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Standing, with reluctant feet,"
245,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Where the brook and river meet,"
246,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Womanhood and childhood fleet!
247,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
248,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Seest thou shadows sailing by,"
249,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"As the dove, with startled eye,"
250,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Sees the falcon's shadow fly?
251,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
252,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Hearest thou voices on the shore,"
253,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"That our ears perceive no more,"
254,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Deafened by the cataract's roar?
255,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
256,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"O, thou child of many prayers!"
257,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Life hath quicksands,--Life hath snares!"
258,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Care and age come unawares!
259,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
260,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Like the swell of some sweet tune,"
261,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Morning rises into noon,"
262,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,May glides onward into June.
263,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
264,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Childhood is the bough, where slumbered"
265,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Birds and blossoms many-numbered;--
266,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Age, that bough with snows encumbered."
267,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
268,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Gather, then, each flower that grows,"
269,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"When the young heart overflows,"
270,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,To embalm that tent of snows.
271,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
272,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Bear a lily in thy hand;
273,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Gates of brass cannot withstand
274,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,One touch of that magic wand.
275,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
276,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Bear through sorrow, wrong, and ruth,"
277,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"In thy heart the dew of youth,"
278,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,On thy lips the seal of truth.
279,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
280,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"O, that dew, like balm shall steal"
281,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Into wounds that cannot heal,"
282,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Even as sleep our eyes doth seal;
283,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
284,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And that smile, like sunshine, dart"
285,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Into many a sunless heart,"
286,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,For a smile of God thou art.
287,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
288,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,_Maidenhood._
289,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
290,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
291,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,[Illustration: _Painting by W. H. Margetson._ MAIDENHOOD.]
292,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
293,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Maiden with the meek, brown eyes"
294,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"In whose orbs a shadow lies,"
295,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Like the dusk in evening skies!
296,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
297,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Thou whose locks outshine the sun,"
298,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Golden tresses, wreathed in one,"
299,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,As the braided streamlets run!
300,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
301,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
302,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"The early instalment of letters attended to, the Poet could devote"
303,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"himself to his own affairs. He believed in _working_ at poetry,"
304,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"methodically, systematically: although inspiration might flow with"
305,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"sudden fervour, it was not to be waited for. ""Regular, proportioned,"
306,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"resolute, incessant industry,"" was the secret of his success, and the"
307,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,erasures and substitutions in his MSS. bear witness to his care in
308,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,craftsmanship. The least conspicuous word must be as perfect as he
309,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"could make it. Longfellow's creed, as expounded in _The Builders_,"
310,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,allowed for no scamped work.
311,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
312,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
313,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"All are architects of Fate,"
314,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Working in these walls of Time:
315,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Some with massive deeds and great,"
316,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Some with ornaments of rhyme.
317,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
318,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Nothing useless is, or low;"
319,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Each thing in its place is best;
320,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And what seems but idle show
321,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Strengthens and supports the rest.
322,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
323,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"For the structure that we raise,"
324,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Time is with materials filled;
325,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Our to-days and yesterdays
326,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Are the blocks with which we build.
327,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
328,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Truly shape and fashion these;
329,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Leave no yawning gaps between;
330,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Think not, because no man sees,"
331,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Such things will remain unseen.
332,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
333,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"In the elder days of Art,"
334,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Builders wrought with greatest care
335,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Each minute and unseen part;
336,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,For the Gods see everywhere.
337,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
338,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Let us do our work as well,"
339,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Both the unseen and the seen;
340,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Make the house, where Gods may dwell,"
341,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Beautiful, entire, and clean."
342,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
343,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Else our lives are incomplete,"
344,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Standing in these walls of Time,"
345,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Broken stairways, where the feet"
346,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Stumble as they seek to climb.
347,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
348,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Build to-day, then, strong and sure,"
349,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,With a firm and ample base;
350,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And ascending and secure
351,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Shall to-morrow find its place.
352,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
353,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Thus alone can we attain
354,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"To those turrets, where the eye"
355,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Sees the world as one vast plain,"
356,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And one boundless reach of sky.
357,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
358,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,_The Builders._
359,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
360,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
361,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Work, indeed, whether mental or physical, was his first instinct, and"
362,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,he has preached the gospel of honest work to the whole English-speaking
363,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,world in some of the most familiar lines in the language.
364,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
365,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
366,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Under a spreading chestnut tree
367,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The village smithy stands;
368,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"The smith, a mighty man is he,"
369,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,With large and sinewy hands;
370,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And the muscles of his brawny arms
371,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Are strong as iron bands.
372,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
373,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"His hair is crisp, and black, and long,"
374,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,His face is like the tan;
375,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"His brow is wet with honest sweat,"
376,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"He earns whate'er he can,"
377,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And looks the whole world in the face,"
378,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,For he owes not any man.
379,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
380,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Week in, week out, from morn till night,"
381,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,You can hear his bellows blow;
382,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,"
383,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"With measured beat and slow,"
384,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Like a sexton ringing the village bell,"
385,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,When the evening sun is low.
386,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
387,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And children coming home from school
388,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Look in at the open door:
389,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"They love to see the flaming forge,"
390,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And hear the bellows roar,"
391,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And catch the burning sparks that fly
392,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Like chaff from a threshing floor.
393,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
394,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"He goes on Sunday to the church,"
395,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And sits among his boys;
396,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"He hears the parson pray and preach,"
397,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"He hears his daughter's voice,"
398,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Singing in the village choir,"
399,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And it makes his heart rejoice.
400,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
401,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"It sounds to him like her mother's voice,"
402,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Singing in Paradise!
403,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"He needs must think of her once more,"
404,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,How in the grave she lies;
405,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And with his hard, rough hand he wipes"
406,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,A tear out of his eyes.
407,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
408,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Toiling,--rejoicing,--sorrowing,"
409,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Onward through life he goes;
410,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Each morning sees some task begin,"
411,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Each evening sees it close;
412,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Something attempted, something done,"
413,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Has earned a night's repose.
414,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
415,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,"
416,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,For the lesson thou hast taught!
417,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Thus at the flaming forge of life
418,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Our fortune must be wrought;
419,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Thus on its sounding anvil shaped
420,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Each burning deed and thought!

426,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
427,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And children coming home from school
428,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Look in at the open door:
429,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"They love to see the flaming forge,"
430,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And hear the bellows roar,"
431,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And catch the burning sparks that fly
432,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Like chaff from a threshing floor.
433,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
434,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
435,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Not for long, however, might Longfellow remain undisturbed in his"
436,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"sunny room. Sometimes he welcomed the opening door that saw ""a little"
437,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"figure stealing gently in, laying an arm round his neck as he bent over"
438,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"his work, and softly whispering some childish secret in his ear."" For"
439,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"this was no obstacle to the current of his tranquil thoughts. ""My little"
440,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"girls are flitting about my study,"" he wrote to a friend, ""as blithe as"
441,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,two birds. They are preparing to celebrate the birthday of one of their
442,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,dolls.... What a beautiful world this child's world is! I take infinite
443,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"delight in seeing it go on all around me."""
444,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
445,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,It was with absolute sincerity that he had exclaimed:
446,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
447,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
448,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Come to me, O ye children!"
449,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"For I hear you at your play,"
450,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And the questions that perplexed me
451,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Have vanished quite away.
452,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
453,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Ye open the eastern windows,"
454,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"That look towards the sun,"
455,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Where thoughts are singing swallows,"
456,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And the brooks of morning run.
457,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
458,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"In your hearts are the birds and the sunshine,"
459,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,In your thoughts the brooklet's flow;
460,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"But in mine is the wind of Autumn,"
461,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And the first fall of the snow.
462,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
463,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Ah! what would the world be to us,"
464,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,If the children were no more?
465,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,We should dread the desert behind us
466,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Worse than the dark before.
467,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
468,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"What the leaves are to the forest,"
469,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"With light and air for food,"
470,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Ere their sweet and tender juices
471,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Have been hardened into wood,--"
472,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
473,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,That to the world are children;
474,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Through them it feels the glow
475,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Of a brighter and sunnier climate
476,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Than reaches the trunks below
477,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
478,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Come to me, O ye children!"
479,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And whisper in my ear
480,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,What the birds and the winds are singing
481,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,In your sunny atmosphere.
482,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
483,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"For what are all our contrivings,"
484,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And the wisdom of our books,"
485,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"When compared with your caresses,"
486,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And the gladness of your looks?
487,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
488,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Ye are better than all the ballads
489,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,That ever were sung or said;
490,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"For ye are living poems,"
491,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And all the rest are dead.

495,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,But these were congenial moments. There were visitors much less
496,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"desirable. ""He was besieged,"" as one of his friends declares, ""by every"
497,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,possible form of interruption which the ingenuity of the human brain
498,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"could devise."" For his admirers, whose name was legion, were not"
499,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,satisfied with hero-worship afar off: they must needs force themselves

502,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
503,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Longfellow, always quick to see the comical side of a situation, would"

506,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"He introduced himself, then returning to the omnibus, took out all the"
507,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"ladies, one, two, three, four, five, with a little girl, and brought"

509,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"an hour."""
510,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
511,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"On another occasion, an English gentleman, with no letter of introduction,"
512,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"abruptly introduced himself, thus: ""In other countries, you know, we go"
513,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"to see ruins, and the like--but you have no ruins in your country, and I"
514,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"thought,"" growing embarrassed, ""I would call and see _you_!"" Another"
515,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"strange gentleman accosted him with great fervour, ""Mr. Longfellow, I"
516,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,have long desired the honour of knowing you. I am one of _the few men_
517,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"who have read your _Evangeline_!"""
518,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
519,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,All these worshippers at his shrine were received by the Poet with his
520,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,unfailing courtesy and patience; but he was invariably adroit in warding
521,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,off compliments. To applause and flattery he was impervious--reference
522,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,to his own works was distasteful to him. His perfect modesty was the
523,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,reflex of his natural reticence.
524,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
525,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Longfellow regarded life from the standpoint of eternity, and thus"
526,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"was one who, in the words of à Kempis, ""careth little for the praise"
527,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"or dispraise of men."" His gaze was riveted upon that ""Land of the"
528,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Hereafter,"" to which he was always more than ready to set out, and in"

531,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
532,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
533,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"On the shore stood Hiawatha,"
534,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Turned and waved his hand at parting;

536,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Launched his birch canoe for sailing,"
537,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,From the pebbles of the margin
538,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Shoved it forth into the water;
539,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Whispered to it ""Westward! westward!"""
540,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And with speed it darted forward.
541,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
542,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And the evening sun descending
543,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Set the clouds on fire with redness,"
544,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Burned the broad sky, like a prairie,"
545,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Left upon the level water
546,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"One long track and trail of splendour,"

549,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Sailed into the fiery sunset,"

553,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And the people from the margin
554,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Watched him floating, rising, sinking,"
555,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Till the birch canoe seemed lifted
556,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"High into that sea of splendour,"
557,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Till it sank into the vapours
558,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Like the new moon slowly, slowly"
559,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Sinking in the purple distance.
560,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
561,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And they said ""Farewell for ever!"""
562,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Said ""Farewell, O Hiawatha!"""

566,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And the waves upon the margin

569,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,"

598,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Personal friends, of whom the Poet possessed many, would arrive in"

603,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"singing, and made tea in the antique silver pot."
604,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
605,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"It was a peaceful, happy hour for the guests. Longfellow, unlike"
606,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Tennyson, was never much of a talker: he was a listener and observer,"
607,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,who dwelt in a speaking silence--in what has been defined as a heavenly
608,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"unfathomableness. Ruskin had written: ""You come as such a _calm_"
609,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"influence to me ... you give me such a feeling of friendship and repose."""
610,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And this feeling was enhanced by the man's natural dignity and grace,"
611,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"the refinement of his features, the perfect taste of his dress, and"
612,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"the exquisite simplicity of his manners. Many have alluded to his soft,"
613,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"musical voice, to his steady blue-grey eyes, to the ""innate charm of"
614,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"tranquillity,"" which gave a peculiar spiritual sweetness to his smile."
615,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"But the man was even more, and better than the poet; so much so that a"
616,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"young enthusiast exclaimed ""All the vulgar and pretentious people in the"
617,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"world ought to be sent to Mr. Longfellow to show them how to behave!"""
618,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Nor was this calm the outcome of natural placidity--it had been attained
619,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,through bitter suffering: it was that gleam of a hero's armour which the

621,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
622,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,

626,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Drops down behind the sky.
627,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
628,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"There is no light in earth or heaven,"
629,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,But the cold light of stars;
630,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And the first watch of night is given
631,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,To the red planet Mars.
632,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
633,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Is it the tender star of love?
634,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The star of love and dreams?
635,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"O no! from that blue tent above,"
636,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,A hero's armour gleams.
637,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
638,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And earnest thoughts within me rise,"
639,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"When I behold afar,"

641,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,The shield of that red star.
642,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
643,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,O star of strength! I see thee stand

646,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And I am strong again.
647,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
648,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Within my breast there is no light,"
649,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,But the cold light of stars;

653,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"The star of the unconquered will,"

674,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"It was a home well worth seeing: and an old-world air pervaded all,"

677,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
678,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Later on, to those with whom he felt specially _en rapport_, Longfellow"
679,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"would read aloud some poems, new or old, his own, or those of other men."
680,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,He was not a forcible or a dramatic reader; the simplicity which he
681,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"loved ""in all things,"" as he had said, ""but specially in poetry,"" was"
682,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,evident also here. Yet perhaps no other man could have done equal justice
683,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"to the lingering hexameters of his most successful poem--for such, by"
684,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"reason of its novelty, pathos, and beauty, _Evangeline_ must always be"
685,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"considered. ""It has become a purifying portion,"" says Rossetti, ""of the"

690,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
691,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
692,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Fair was she to behold, that maiden of seventeen summers."
693,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the
694,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"wayside,"
695,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Black, yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her"
696,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,tresses!
697,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows.
698,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,When in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noon-tide
699,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Flagons of home-brewed ale, ah! fair in sooth was the maiden."
700,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Fairer was she when, on Sunday morn, while the bell from its turret"
701,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Sprinkled with holy sounds the air, as the priest with his hyssop"
702,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Sprinkles the congregation, and scatters blessings upon them,"
703,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Down the long street she passed, with her chaplet of beads and her"

705,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Wearing her Norman cap, and her kirtle of blue, and the ear-rings,"
706,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Brought in the olden time from France, and since, as an heir-loom,"
707,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Handed down from mother to child, through long generations."
708,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,But a celestial brightness--a more ethereal beauty--
709,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Shone on her face and encircled her form, when, after confession,"
710,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Homeward serenely she walked with God's benediction upon her.

775,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"were focussed and centred in the love he bore to his own dear,"

777,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
778,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
779,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Between the dark and the daylight,"
780,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"When the night is beginning to lower,"
781,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Comes a pause in the day's occupations,"
782,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,That is known as the Children's Hour.
783,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
784,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,I hear in the chamber above me
785,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"The patter of little feet,"
786,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"The sound of a door that is opened,"
787,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And voices soft and sweet.
788,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
789,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"From my study I see in the lamplight,"
790,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Descending the broad hall-stair,"
791,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra,"
792,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And Edith with golden hair.
793,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
794,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"A whisper, and then a silence:"
795,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Yet I know by their merry eyes
796,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,They are plotting and planning together
797,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,To take me by surprise.
798,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
799,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"A sudden rush from the stairway,"
800,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,A sudden raid from the hall!
801,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,By three doors left unguarded
802,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,They enter my castle wall!
803,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
804,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"They climb up into my turret,"
805,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,O'er the arms and back of my chair;
806,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,If I try to escape they surround me;
807,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,They seem to be everywhere.
808,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
809,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"They almost devour me with kisses,"
810,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Their arms about me entwine,"
811,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen
812,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine!
813,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
814,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti,"
815,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Because you have scaled the wall,"
816,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Such an old moustache as I am
817,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Is not a match for you all!
818,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
819,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"I have you fast in my fortress,"
820,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And will not let you depart,"
821,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,But put you down in the dungeon
822,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,In the round-tower of my heart.
823,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
824,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And there I will keep you for ever,"
825,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Yes, for ever and a day,"
826,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,"
827,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And moulder in dust away!

831,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
832,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"A brief period of childish gaiety would supervene, to which the man of"
833,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,childlike heart responded readily; and when the little feet had pattered
834,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"bedward, and the house was silent from the merry little voices, the"
835,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,father would sit on until midnight in his spacious empty room. He would
836,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"occupy himself with letters--long, fragrant, pleasant gossips to his"
837,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,best and most familiar friends at a distance: till midnight came upon
838,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"him unawares. ""It is nearly one o'clock--I am the only person up in the"
839,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"house: my candle is sinking in its socket."""
840,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
841,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And a double loneliness descended upon him as his weary hand laid
842,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,down the pen. He remained inert and brooding; the solitude was
843,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"almost tangible. But this solitude was presently peopled by visions,"
844,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,fraught with ineffable consolation to a mind never out of touch with
845,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"""other-worldly"" influences."
846,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
847,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
848,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"When the hours of Day are numbered,"
849,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And the voices of the Night
850,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Wake the better soul, that slumbered,"
851,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"To a holy, calm delight;"
852,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
853,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Ere the evening lamps are lighted,"
854,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And, like phantoms grim and tall,"
855,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Shadows from the fitful firelight
856,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Dance upon the parlour wall;
857,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
858,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Then the forms of the departed
859,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Enter at the open door;
860,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"The beloved, the true-hearted,"
861,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Come to visit me once more;
862,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
863,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"He, the young and strong, who cherished"
864,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Noble longings for the strife,"
865,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"By the roadside fell and perished,"
866,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Weary with the march of life!
867,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
868,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"They the holy ones and weakly,"
869,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Who the cross of suffering bore,"
870,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Folded their pale hands so meekly,"
871,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Spake with us on earth no more!
872,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
873,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"And with them the Being Beauteous,"
874,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Who unto my youth was given,"
875,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"More than all things else to love me,"
876,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And is now a saint in heaven.
877,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
878,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,With a slow and noiseless footstep
879,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Comes that messenger divine,"
880,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Takes the vacant chair beside me,"
881,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Lays her gentle hand in mine.
882,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
883,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,And she sits and gazes at me
884,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"With those deep and tender eyes,"
885,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Like the stars, so still and saint-like,"
886,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Looking downward from the skies.
887,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
888,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Uttered not, yet comprehended,"
889,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Is the spirit's voiceless prayer,"
890,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"Soft rebukes, in blessings ended,"
891,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Breathing from her lips of air.
892,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,
893,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"O, though oft depressed and lonely,"
894,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,"All my fears are laid aside,"
895,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,If I but remember only
896,A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW,Such as these have lived and died!
