34,FOREWORD,In the assembling of material so widely scattered and so long unsought
35,FOREWORD,"either by students or by collectors, it has been necessary for me"
36,FOREWORD,to depend in some measure on the efforts of others who have been
37,FOREWORD,most generous with their help and assistance. I desire to record
38,FOREWORD,"my gratitude especially to my Father and my Mother, without whose"
39,FOREWORD,unfailing sympathy and co-operation this work could not have been done:
40,FOREWORD,"and to Mrs. C. Francis Osborne of Philadelphia, Miss Sallie Shepherd"
41,FOREWORD,"of Norfolk, Virginia, and Miss Florence D. Johnston of Philadelphia,"
42,FOREWORD,for books and individual poems. For their courtesy in allowing me free
43,FOREWORD,access to the collections committed to their charge I must acknowledge
44,FOREWORD,"further indebtedness to Mr. Wallace H. Cathcart, Vice-President and"
45,FOREWORD,"Director of the Western Reserve Historical Society, Cleveland, whose"
46,FOREWORD,splendid collection of Civil War items contains many rare and important
47,FOREWORD,"imprints and broadsides: and to Mr. Bunford Samuel, of the Ridgway"
48,FOREWORD,"Branch of the Library Company of Philadelphia, to whose private"
49,FOREWORD,collection I am indebted for several poems which I have not found

108,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
109,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“The emotional literature of a people,” wrote one of the greatest of"
110,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Southern poets, William Gilmore Simms,[1] “is as necessary to the"
111,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,philosophic historian as the mere detail of events in the progress of a
112,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,nation.... The mere facts in a history do not always or often indicate
113,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the true _animus_ of the action. But in poetry and song the emotional
114,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,nature is apt to declare itself without reserve ... speaking out with
115,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"a passion which disdains subterfuge, and through media of imagination"
116,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and fancy, which are not only without reserve, but which are too"
117,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"coercive in their own nature, too arbitrary in their own influence, to"
118,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,acknowledge any restraint upon that expression which glows or weeps
119,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,with emotions that gush freshly and freely from the heart.”
120,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
121,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Edmund Clarence Stedman[2] put the matter a little differently.
122,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Asking what may constitute the significance of any body of rhythmical
123,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"literature, restricted to its own territory, he answered the question"
124,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"thus: “Undoubtedly and first of all, the essential quality of its"
125,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"material as poetry; next to this, its quality as an expression and"
126,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"interpretation of the time itself. In many an era, the second factor"
127,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"may afford a surer means of estimate than the first, inasmuch as the"
128,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,purely literary result may be nothing rarer than the world already has
129,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"possessed, nor greatly differing from it: nevertheless it may be the"
130,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"voice of a time, of a generation, of a people ... all of extraordinary"
131,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,import to the world’s future.”
132,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
133,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Our own poetry,” he continues elsewhere,[3] “excels as a recognizable"
134,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,voice in utterance of the emotions of a people. The storm and stress
135,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of youth have been upon us, and the nation has not lacked its lyric"
136,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"cry.... One who underrates the significance of our literature, prose"
137,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"or verse, as both the expression and the stimulant of national feeling,"
138,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"as of import in the past and to the future of America, is deficient in"
139,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,that critical insight which can judge even of its own day unwarped by
140,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,personal taste or deference to public impression. He shuts his eyes to
141,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the fact that at times, notably throughout the years resulting in the"
142,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Civil War, this literature has been a ‘force.’”"
143,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
144,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,That the poetry written in the Confederate States during the days of
145,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the Civil War was a “force” in potency second only to the army in the
146,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"field, is a fact that has been too long unnoticed by commentators on"
147,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the literature of our country. In the rare cases when its influence was
148,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"recognized, its quality has been mistaken, its character misunderstood,"
149,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,its quantity and volume under-estimated. Due perhaps in part to the
150,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,intensity of feeling engendered between victors and vanquished in
151,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Lost Cause, the darkness of the days following the close of the"
152,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,war effectively hid from view and kept from national circulation the
153,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,verses and songs which the war had produced in the South. This was the
154,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,primary cause which prevented them from attaining the universal and
155,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,critical appreciation of their value that was the right of so large
156,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and important a movement in the history of American letters. The ruin
157,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the South financially and economically, prevented her from calling"
158,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,attention to her own achievement: while the widespread destruction and
159,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"dispersal of property, as well as the necessarily ephemeral nature of"
160,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"many of her publications, offers not the least satisfactory explanation"
161,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,for the comparative restriction of Southern Civil War verse to the land
162,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,whence it sprang.
163,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
164,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"If, however, to the modern critic these poems and songs are"
165,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"comparatively unknown, by the Southerner of Civil War days their value"
166,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,was understood and appreciated to the full. Within a year after war
167,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"broke out, early in the days of ’62, at least two definite attempts to"
168,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"assemble the fast multiplying verses and songs were being made, the"
169,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"first[4] by Professor Chase and John R. Thompson of Richmond, editor of"
170,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the _Southern Field and Fireside_; the second by “Bohemian,” Mr. W. G."
171,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Shepperson, who was a correspondent for the Richmond _Despatch_. The"
172,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"latter effort resulted, in the spring of ’62, in a volume of “War Songs"
173,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the South,” containing some one hundred and eight poems, and with"
174,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the following significant words in the Preface:
175,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
176,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Written contemporaneously with the achievements which they celebrate,"
177,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,[these poems] possess all the vitality and force of the testimony
178,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of eye-witnesses to a glorious combat, or even of actors in it. The"
179,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"spontaneous outburst of popular feeling, they give the lie to the"
180,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,assertion of our enemy that this revolution is the work of politicians
181,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and party leaders alone.
182,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
183,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Through the Poets’ Corner in the newspaper, they have sped their"
184,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,flight from and to the heart and mind of the people. They showed which
185,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,way the wind was blowing when the war arose ‘a little cloud like a
186,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"man’s hand,’ and black as the heavens may now appear, they bravely sing"
187,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"above the storm, soaring so high that their wings are brightened by the"
188,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,sun behind the clouds.
189,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
190,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,“They cannot fail to challenge the attention of the philosophic
191,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"historian by their origin, and their influence.... In every age,"
192,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,martial songs have wrought wonders in struggles for national
193,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,independence.
194,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
195,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,“And surely these newspaper waifs have played no unimportant part in
196,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the actual drama which surrounds us....
197,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
198,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,“A single volume of ordinary size cannot contain a tithe of the songs
199,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"which have already appeared, and are daily appearing. This, however,"
200,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"offers enough to show that during the present eventful period, what"
201,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,was said of the early Spaniard is true of the Southron: ‘He has been
202,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"unconsciously surrounding history with the light of imagination,"
203,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"linking great names with great deeds, concentrating those universal"
204,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"recollections in which everyone feels he has a part, and silently"
205,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,building up the fabric of national poetry on the basis of national
206,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,enthusiasm.’”
207,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
208,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Fifty years later another Southerner, William Malone Baskerville,[5]"
209,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"wrote this: “A young Marylander, a stripling just from college, was"
210,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,dreaming dreams from which he was awakened by the guns of Sumter. One
211,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"sleepless night in April, 1861, he wrote the poem, ‘My Maryland,’ which"
212,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,may not inaptly be called the first note of the new Southern literature
213,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"... ‘new in strength, new in depth, new in the largest elements of"
214,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,beauty and truth.’ He that had ears to hear might have heard in the
215,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"booming of those guns not only the signal for a gigantic contest, but"
216,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"also the proclamation of the passing away of the old order, and along"
217,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"with it the waxflowery, amateurish and sentimental race of Southern"
218,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"writers.” The passing of this school, of course, meant the passing"
219,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of what usually has been recognized as the typical literary mode of
220,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the South. It meant, however, much more than this: for the changing"
221,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,order was made possible only by the passing of the particular type of
222,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"civilization that had fostered it, and this, in its turn indicated a"
223,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"complete and thorough renaissance not only of life and letters, but"
224,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,also of Southern soul and spirit.
225,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
226,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The type of civilization that endured in the South, to the days of the"
227,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Civil War, was one of the most picturesque periods of society that can"
228,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"be imagined, but not one that induced or encouraged serious literature."
229,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"In the North, on the other hand, where there were to be found many"
230,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"large cities as centres of population, and the great national colleges,"
231,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,literature had developed with the people. The earliest settlers of
232,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"New England had been of a religious, thoughtful, and philosophical"
233,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"disposition, and their manners and mode of life had served to"
234,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,strengthen these tendencies in their descendants. Even the climate
235,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of the country had a marked influence in emphasizing New England’s
236,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,bent towards literature. Rigorous winters and inclement temperatures
237,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"led to long enforced periods of indoor life, conducive to study and"
238,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,reflection. The effort and stress required to wring a living from
239,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the stubborn soil made them an active and a vigorous people. At the
240,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"same time the comparatively small size of their territory, the number"
241,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of their towns and cities and the ease of travel over the hard and
242,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"rocky roads brought them much in contact with each other, and insured"
243,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,communication of thought. Theirs was a civilization founded on civil
244,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"ties. Farms were small, cultivated usually by the family of the owners,"
245,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"with a few “hired help,” and centered about the smaller villages and"
246,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"townships, which in their turn were satellites of the towns. The"
247,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"towns, again, clustered around the cities, which were thus as hubs in"
248,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the wheels of society. The rising individual graduated from the town
249,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"to the city, where were gathered the leading spirits and forces of"
250,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the day. From the cities back to the smaller communities returned the
251,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"great newspapers and magazines, whose spiritual and mental authority"
252,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"went unchallenged, and which served the more to amalgamate into a"
253,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,living thoughtful whole the inhabitants of the farthest corner of the
254,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,countryside. For everyone life was hard and plain; and there followed
255,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the accepted corollary of high and resolute thought.
256,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
257,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"In the South, the thought unquestionably was as grave and lofty. It"
258,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was, however, neither in the hands of the people, as a whole, nor so"
259,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,thoroughly co-ordinated into an entity. This lack of centralization
260,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and unity arose from the very order of society, and was at once its"
261,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"destruction, its charm, and its misfortune. In the first place, as"
262,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"regards its territory in comparison with the North, there were few"
263,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"large cities, and these were far apart. From Richmond to Charleston"
264,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and New Orleans as the crow flies is nearly three times the distance
265,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"from Boston to Philadelphia. In the days of postillions, and in the"
266,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"later days of steamboats and railroads, a warm damp climate made travel"
267,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,tedious and tiresome. Neither did the large cities occupy the positions
268,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of importance of their Northern rivals. Because of the fertile soil,"
269,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,fair climate and multiplicity of laborers the financial and political
270,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,power of the country was to be found quite as often among the owners
271,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the great plantations, as in the counting rooms or law offices of"
272,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the metropolis. For various reasons, there were no great and powerful"
273,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"publishing houses, or influential magazines in general circulation,"
274,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the newspaper taking these places. Another factor there was also,"
275,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,that was especially disintegrating for society at large. Before the
276,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"war, education in the South was not universal. For about half the"
277,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"population, the women were educated at home, or in the case of the"
278,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"well-to-do, at seminaries and boarding schools. The men, as in the old"
279,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Colonial days, had their private tutors, and were then sent to the"
280,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Universities at home or abroad, and to travel. But for the mass of"
281,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the poorer people, there was little to be had beyond the rudiments of"
282,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,training: and for many years the University of Virginia was the only
283,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"educational institution below the line, which was the academic equal of"
284,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Northern colleges. Education here, as everywhere in the South, was"
285,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"along purely classic lines, which trained the people to find authority"
286,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in the past, and which tended to create a lack of sympathy with"
287,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,problems other than those immediately concerning the public polity.
288,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Hence it was that the intellectual relationships of the North were
289,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,exchanged in the South for social ties; which proved in times of stress
290,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"more powerful and unifying than those beyond the Line, and which made"
291,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"possible, later on, the sympathetic consolidation and confederacy of"
292,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the States at the first minute of invasion. In that instant, they were"
293,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“a band of brothers,” in a common fellowship and interest: and thus it"
294,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,was that the very conditions militating against their literature and
295,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"literary progress before the War, became in 1861, at once their allies"
296,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in the field, and on Parnassus."
297,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
298,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,It is undeniable that the literary history of the antebellum South
299,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,could brook no comparison with that of the North. An agricultural
300,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"people such as the Southerners were, are apt to live their lyrics"
301,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and romances, rather than write them. Her greatest novelists, Simms"
302,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and Kennedy and John Esten Cooke, had given her quiet old-fashioned"
303,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,historical or pseudo-historical tales after the pattern of Sir Walter
304,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Scott. Today these seem curiously dull and prosy, and more so when"
305,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,placed in comparison with the extraordinarily ornate and grotesque
306,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Gothic romances of her women writers. That style of fiction of which
307,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Mrs. Hentz, Mrs. Southworth and Miss Evans were the representative"
308,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,authors may only be described as unreal and utterly false in tone
309,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and color. It is sensational to a degree, but its popularity was in"
310,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"proportion to its lack of artistic conception. Further than this, what"
311,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was true of her prose, was true of her verse. Just as the fiction of"
312,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the South was an echo of earlier modes, so her chief lyrists wrote in"
313,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the manner of the cavaliers. On the whole, the Southern character had"
314,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,seemed better adapted to the practice of politics and the management
315,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of plantations, than to government in the province of literature."
316,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Southerners wrote easily and gracefully, but without the sincerity and"
317,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,beauty that arise from perfect sympathy between the craftsman and his
318,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,craft.
319,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
320,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"It was when a great emotion had thrilled the heart of the South, and"
321,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,her spirit kindled to a single mighty flame in the prosecution of a
322,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"cause on which she could unite all her energies, that the artificiality"
323,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of her literature dropped away, and was replaced by strength of"
324,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"color, truth of outline and power of expression. Before the terror of"
325,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"civil war, the horror of invasion, and the indignity of submission to"
326,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,what she deemed a false interpretation of the Constitution and the
327,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"principles of Liberty for which her fathers had fought, the literature"
328,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the South lost its superficiality, its romantic characteristics."
329,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"From the earliest days of the war, prose in the form of history,"
330,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"philosophical essays and controversial debate, became the recognized"
331,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and powerful weapon wielded by her greatest minds: while poetry, in"
332,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the hands alike of poet and peasant, became the great national organ"
333,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,for emotional expression.
334,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
335,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Fully to appreciate the themes and refrains that filled her war verse,"
336,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"it is necessary to understand for just what principles, and with what"
337,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"a temper, the South began the fight. Whatever had been the immediate"
338,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"excuse for war, for the Southerner the conflict very quickly resolved"
339,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,itself into a struggle for liberty. The principle of States’ Rights
340,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,had always been cherished in the South since the days of the Articles
341,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of Confederation, in 1781, which declared at the very onset that"
342,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,while adopting this plan that was designed to make of the various
343,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"integers a government that might be per se recognizable,--“each state"
344,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"retained its sovereignty, freedom and independence.” “Submission to"
345,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"any encroachment, the least as well as the greatest, on the rights of"
346,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"a state means slavery,” wrote Dr. Basil Gildersleeve.[6] “The extreme"
347,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Southern States considered this right menaced by the issue of the
348,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,presidential election.” The South had always clung to the earlier
349,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,conception of national union of separate and independent units. That
350,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the North regarded her as a rebel against the Constitution of her
351,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"fathers but goaded her the more bitterly, who felt that above all"
352,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"things she battled in the right, for the freedom of which Washington"
353,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"himself had dreamed, and which her own ancestors had been the greater"
354,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,part of the instrument in winning and perfecting. It was therefore to
355,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the South a holy contest. “Right or wrong, we were fully persuaded in"
356,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"our own minds, and there was no lurking suspicion of any moral weakness"
357,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in our cause,” continued Dr. Gildersleeve.[7] “Nothing could be holier"
358,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"than the cause, nothing more imperative than the duty of upholding it."
359,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"There were those in the South who when they saw the issue of the War,"
360,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"gave up their faith in God, but not their faith in the cause.”"
361,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
362,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"With Lincoln’s decision to provision Fort Sumter, on April 1, 1861,"
363,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and his call for troops, two weeks later, the question of States’"
364,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Rights was amplified by the addition of two other sentiments which
365,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"three together formed the lofty inspiration that, in the South lifted"
366,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the struggle above the commonplaces of civil strife. At once it
367,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was dignified into a war in defence of home, of native land, and of"
368,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,liberty. It was therefore with a certain nobility of purpose that the
369,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Confederate Army went forth to battle. The North had enlisted on a
370,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,punitive expedition: the South had engaged in a crusade for her ideals.
371,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,This was the magic touch that transmuted the comparative dross of her
372,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,literature to pure gold. “When there flashed upon poetic souls not the
373,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"political issues that were at stake, but the great human situation"
374,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the struggle, they gave voice to the pent up feelings of the new"
375,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,nation.”
376,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
377,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The poetic genius of the Southerners had always been lyric in
378,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"character, partly as the result of environment, partly that of racial"
379,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"temper, partly as an inheritance from the old Cavaliers who had been"
380,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,their ancestors. Nor had the lyrists of the South been of slender
381,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,numbers. Professor Manly’s “Southern Literature” credits the land
382,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,with over two hundred poets whom he considered worthy of mention.
383,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"More than fifty of these belong to Virginia alone, and Dr. Painter"
384,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,wrote[8] of their work that “examination ... reveals among a good deal
385,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"that is commonplace and imitative, many a little gem that ought to be"
386,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"preserved.” Their method was usually Byronic and amorous. They had,"
387,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"it is true, made little or no use of local color or legend, and had"
388,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"given over the narrative and the dramatic for the lyric. Their work,"
389,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"however, was always melodious and of easy numbers. This was their"
390,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"particular characteristic. The second, and indeed the more interesting,"
391,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was the lack of the professional touch. Before the War, there had been"
392,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"few vocational poets, as there had been few professed _literateurs_."
393,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Poetry was the possession of the many, not of a small group of favored"
394,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"ones, and these wrote purely for the pleasure of the art, with so"
395,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,little care for fame or reputation that many of their verses still
396,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"remain uncollected. When, therefore, the emotion of the conflict was"
397,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"borne upon the South, there were poets to fight her battles--just as"
398,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"there were soldiers in the field,--who were using an accustomed mode,"
399,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"though with unaccustomed sincerity and felicity. Indeed, the number of"
400,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,war poets is one of the amazing phenomena of the time: and as in the
401,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"North, literature was mainly in their hands. Beyond the line there were"
402,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Longfellow, Whittier, Lowell, Emerson, Holmes, Boker, Whitman and Mrs."
403,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Stowe. In the South, Hayne, Timrod, Ticknor, Simms, John R. Thompson,"
404,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"George Bagby, Dr. Holcombe, Mrs. Preston, Mrs. Charles, and Father Ryan"
405,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"filled roles as lofty, and as surely inspired. There was, however,"
406,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,this difference in their work. The poets of the North lived and wrote
407,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,in comparative security and remoteness from the field. Their verses
408,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"were characterized by a virtuous indignation against the rebellion, by"
409,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"appeals for men, anger at constant delay and unnecessary defeat, and"
410,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,deliberate exhortations in the name of the Union.
411,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
412,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"In the South, on the other hand, conditions were quite different. The"
413,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"whole land was a battle field, which every man, woman and child was"
414,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"bound by his principles to defend with his very life, and from which"
415,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,they had pledged themselves to drive the invading hordes. Each soul
416,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was personally involved in the conflict, and the poets, instead of"
417,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"looking on the struggle from afar, and distantly applauding it, looked"
418,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"out from the very centres of confusion, calling to their people words"
419,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of help and cheer and courage. Theirs was not a plea to engage in the
420,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,conflict. Theirs was the shout of “Come to the battle! Help us or we
421,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"perish, and with us the sacred fires of true and personal Freedom.” It"
422,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was the “terrible experience of a mighty conflict,[9] in which the soul"
423,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the people was ... brought out through struggles, passion, partings,"
424,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"heroism, love, death, ... all effective in the production of genuine"
425,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,feeling and the development of real character. While the battles were
426,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"being fought in the homes of the Southerners, their poets sent forth"
427,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"now a stirring martial lyric, now a humorous song or poem recounting"
428,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the trials and hardships of camp, hospital and prison life ... these"
429,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"becoming ever more and more intermingled with dirges for Jackson, for"
430,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Albert Sidney Johnston, for Stuart, for Ashby, and finally for the"
431,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Conquered Banner. In all these there was no trace of artificiality, no"
432,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"sign of the mawkish sentimentality of the old waxflowery, amateurish"
433,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and sentimental race of Southern writers.... They were surcharged
434,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"with deep, genuine, sincere feeling. They were instinct with life. In"
435,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,this respect the war poetry laid the foundation of the new Southern
436,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"literature ... ‘new in strength, new in depth, new in the largest"
437,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,elements of beauty and truth.’”
438,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
439,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"It was a terrible price to pay for a renaissance of art, wrung as"
440,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,it was from the heart of a wounded people. It appeared still more a
441,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,vain and useless sacrifice because at first the Southern war poetry
442,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"gave rise to no literary genre. Indirectly, however, in its return to"
443,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"reality, to simplicity of emotion and truth of passion, this war verse"
444,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,was of inestimable value to the rising school of Southern fiction and
445,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"prose. Nevertheless, the renaissance could not come at once. It was"
446,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"only when the pain and ruin of war had somewhat passed, and the South"
447,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,had begun to recover from the waste which the conflict had wrought on
448,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the land, when the bitterness of the struggle had softened with the"
449,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"changing years and generations, and after the new attitude towards life"
450,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"had had time to crystalize into permanency, that one of her younger"
451,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"poets could write of her, with truth:[10]"
452,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
453,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Lo! from the war cloud, dull and dense,"
454,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Loyal and chaste and brave and strong
455,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Comes forth the South with frankincense,"
456,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,And vital freshness in her song.
457,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The weight is fallen from her wings,"
458,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,To find a purer air she springs
459,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Out of the night, into the morn."

469,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Contemporary criticism is seldom safely to be trusted, but there"
470,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,are times when contemporaneous comment is as valuable as it is
471,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,enlightening. It is so with this statement by T. C. de Leon--in his
472,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,introduction to an anthology of the Southern Civil War verse.[11]
473,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,“If poems born of revolution bore no marks of the bitter need that
474,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"crushed them from the hearts of their authors, they would have no value"
475,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"whatever, intrinsic or historical.”"
476,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
477,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Southern war poetry is worthy of preservation because it is an
478,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,expression of vital appeal and of sentiment wrung from the heart of
479,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"a people. For the most part, it was written under the stress of the"
480,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"moment. It was indeed the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotion, but"
481,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,only occasionally does it take its origin from emotion recollected in
482,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"tranquillity. Nevertheless, it speaks the language of men and women,"
483,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and in it we may read, as perhaps through no other medium, the true"
484,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"story of the development of Southern character, of national spirit, and"
485,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of definite sectional consciousness.
486,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
487,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Today the poetry remains to us in the newspapers and magazines of the
488,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"period, and in the anthologies and various collections of war verse"
489,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,(the best of these appearing either during the war or shortly after).
490,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Most interesting, but most ephemeral of them all, it remains in part in"
491,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the small printed broadsides, or single sheets in handbill form, which"
492,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"usually appeared anonymously and mysteriously, at times even without"
493,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the name of the printer. Issued in varying numbers, on wretched paper,"
494,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and seldom gathered together, so many of these have perished in the"
495,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"passage of the years, that in many instances a single copy may remain"
496,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,in existence. Of the verses that circulated in MSS. there is now little
497,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"trace. Occasionally, as in the case of K--s “To the Memory of Stonewall"
498,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Jackson,” some old copy-book or diary will restore them to the light:"
499,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"but of the various sources, less result is obtained from this field"
500,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,than from the others.
501,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
502,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Next to the appearance of the poems in the papers and journals,"
503,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,publication by broadside was probably the most common usage. Especially
504,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in the later days of the war, when newspaper publication was either"
505,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"temporarily or entirely suspended, this medium insured the quickest"
506,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"distribution of verse particularly applicable to the moment, a battle"
507,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"ode, a dirge of a fallen leader, or a song of peculiarly inspiriting"
508,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,phraseology. It was in this broadside form that “My Maryland” spread
509,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"through the South almost in a day, anonymously, and often suffering"
510,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,from lines badly copied or cut. That Randall was the author was a fact
511,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,silently understood and communicated: for it was safest and wisest in
512,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"those early days, and particularly in the border states, that names"
513,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"be not mentioned. Even later, and after months of war, this condition"
514,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"still obtained. The appearance, in September, 1862, of “Stonewall"
515,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Jackson’s Way,” written by Dr. John Williamson Palmer, as he listened"
516,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"to the guns of Sharpsburg, is a case in point. Dr. Palmer gives this"
517,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"history of the poem, and its publication:[12]"
518,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
519,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“In September, 1862, I found myself ... at Oakland ... in Garrett"
520,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"County, Maryland. Early on the sixteenth there was a roar of guns in"
521,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the air, and we knew that a great battle was toward ... I knew that"
522,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Stonewall was in it, whatever it might be: it was his way,--‘Stonewall"
523,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Jackson’s Way.’ I had twice put that phrase into my war letters, and"
524,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"other correspondents, finding it handy, had quoted it in theirs. I"
525,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,paced the piazza and whistled a song of Oregon lumbermen and loggers
526,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,that I had learned from a California adventurer in Honolulu. The two
527,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,thoughts were coupled and welded into one to make a song: and as the
528,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,words gathered to the call of the tune I wrote the ballad of ‘Stonewall
529,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Jackson’s Way’ with the roar of these guns in my ears. On the morrow I
530,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,added the last stanza....
531,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
532,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“In Baltimore I told the story of the song to my father, and at his"
533,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,request made immediately another copy of it. This was shown cautiously
534,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,to certain members of the Maryland Club: and a trusty printer was
535,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"found who struck off a dozen slips of it, principally for private"
536,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,distribution. That first printed copy of the song was headed ‘Found on
537,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"a Rebel Sergeant of the Old Stonewall Brigade, Taken at Winchester.’"
538,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The fabulous legend was for the misleading of the Federal provost
539,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"marshal, as were also the address and date, ‘Martinsburg, September 13,"
540,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,1862.’”
541,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
542,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,It must not be supposed that this war verse which has survived to
543,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,our day consists merely of battle songs and popular ballads on
544,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,themes arising from the nature of the conflict. Just as the war was
545,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"far reaching and general in its effect, touching every Southerner"
546,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"personally, and too often poignantly, so the poetic response was varied"
547,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and modified to meet the demand of the moment. There is description,"
548,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and narration; there are of course dialectics and polemics; there is
549,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,satire; and there is even a little humor. And because through all this
550,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"rings the personal and individual appeal, the prevailing note is lyric."
551,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Of the dramatic there is very little, notably Hayne’s “The Substitute,”"
552,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and “The Royal Ape.” This last is a long dramatic narrative in iambic
553,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,pentameter rimed couplets that is possibly more interesting as satire
554,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and propaganda than as pure drama. Yet neither of these is a work of
555,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,free inspiration. The Southern war poet did his best work when out of
556,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the fulness of his heart, he either vowed allegiance to his beloved"
557,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"land, and her leaders, or wrote in passion and defiance as a resolved"
558,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,defender of the freedom of his Fathers.
559,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
560,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Judged from an emotional point of view, this poetry falls into three"
561,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"distinct periods, obvious enough in themselves, but interesting"
562,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,in that by them we may see more clearly the issues of the war as
563,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,reflected in the hearts of the warriors. There are the first poems of
564,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,rebellion against oppression: lyrics of passionate defiance as well as
565,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of hortatory counsel: appeals to remember the glory of the past and
566,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the danger of the present. The second period started at the moment
567,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of invasion after which there was no longer need for a Congress to
568,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"formulate the principles for which they fought, or to arrange for the"
569,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,unifying of the various State integers. Then began the poetry of actual
570,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"conflict, taking the form of verses concerning particular battles, the"
571,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"narration of some heroic deed, the lament for a great hero, as well"
572,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"as camp ballads, and marching songs. As a connecting link with the"
573,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"first period, there are still the poems breathing the national spirit,"
574,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and loyalty to the Southern cause. Even in the third and last period,"
575,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"that of disappointment, discouragement and actual defeat, this note"
576,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"continues, and is the more poignant for its unfaltering persistence in"
577,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the face of calamity.
578,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
579,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The poetry of the first period began in the closing days of 1860. In
580,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,November of that year there had been elected by the North and West a
581,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,President whose principles of government seemed to threaten the South
582,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,with danger of extermination of her most precious interests. The
583,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,platform of Republicanism she considered in every respect inimical to
584,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,her importance as a unit in the central organization of states. Her
585,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"very identity was endangered, and that to a section where pride of"
586,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"historic heritage was as dear as actual power of wealth and commerce,"
587,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"aroused her as could perhaps nothing else. Therefore, on December"
588,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"twentieth, 1860, South Carolina passed her order of secession,"
589,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"following it with the “Declaration of Independence,” which justified"
590,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the previous action by recalling the two great principles asserted by
591,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the early colonies, namely, “the right of a state to govern itself,"
592,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and the right of a people to abolish a government when it becomes
593,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,destructive to the ends for which it was instituted. And concurrent
594,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,with the establishment of these principles was the fact that each
595,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"colony became and was recognized by the mother country as a free,"
596,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"sovereign and independent state.” It was a proud imperious challenge,"
597,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and made immediate appeal to every Southerner to whom freedom and
598,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"independence, personal or otherwise, was a precious birthright. The"
599,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"proclamation fired the imagination, as it did the poetic spirit of the"
600,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,land: the poetic response struck the same note. S. Henry Dickson’s
601,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,“South Carolina” was one of the first poems to appear. Its verses are
602,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"as lofty in tone as the lines of the proclamation, and equally as"
603,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,sincere. They are frankly exultant.
604,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
605,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The deed is done! the die is cast;
606,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The glorious Rubicon is passed:

635,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Hail, Carolina! free forever!"
636,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
637,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"This may be the expression of the hour, but it proved as well to be"
638,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the poetic sentiment of the next four years. Every poet of the South,"
639,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"from the humblest maker of camp catches to the greatest of her lyrists,"
640,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"shared this attitude of resolve, as they watched their Spartan nation"
641,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"continue to wage what they consented to be a righteous war for freedom,"
642,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"against a tyrant power. Naturally, expression became more sharply"
643,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"crystalized with the actual invasion. None the less, even thus early,"
644,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"before the end of ’60, we have a precise foreshadowing of the war"
645,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,attitude of the Confederate poet.
646,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
647,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"With the passage of secession in South Carolina, at once the remaining"
648,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,“Cotton States” were torn by the conflict of making a great decision.
649,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,There were those to whom the indignity of submitting their conception
650,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of government to what they called a usurpation of authority was
651,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,inconceivable treachery to an ancient and honorable past: and there
652,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,were those to whom unquestioning obedience to the Government at
653,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Washington was the only way of fulfilling the heritage of their
654,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"ancestors. In the end, the extremists won. The North would offer no"
655,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"compromise: indeed, it would have been contrary to the Southern code"
656,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of honor to have accepted halfway measures. To them there appeared no
657,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"other course to pursue, no solution but to follow Carolina’s lordly"
658,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"lead. Mississippi seceded on January ninth, Florida on the tenth,"
659,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Alabama on the eleventh, Georgia on the nineteenth, Louisiana on the"
660,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,twenty-sixth.
661,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
662,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"For the South as a whole, as well as for her poets, January had been a"
663,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"month of tempest. Following the secession of Carolina, the situation"
664,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,that had developed over Fort Sumter was dangerous to the extreme.
665,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"As it afterwards proved, Sumter was the tinder which kindled the"
666,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"flame of war; and as early as January, when Major Anderson refused to"
667,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,surrender the fort the menace within the South began to show itself.
668,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The authorities of Charleston, endangered by Federal possession of"
669,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Sumter, demanded its surrender. No decision could have been reached"
670,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"until after March fourth, when Lincoln was inaugurated. Meanwhile,"
671,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"on the fourth of February, the six states which had already left the"
672,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Union, and Texas, which seceded three days earlier, formally met at"
673,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"convention in Charleston, and united in a Confederacy, in opposition to"
674,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Government at Washington. It was a move which their poets, as well"
675,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"as their more practically visioned men, had been frantically urging."
676,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Two of the most interesting of the poems of this period appeared,"
677,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the one in the _Southern Literary Messenger_ for January, by William"
678,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Gilmore Simms, the other in the _Charleston Courier_, about the middle"
679,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the month, addressed in French, by R. Thomassy, under date of"
680,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Nouvelle Orleans, 2 Janvier 1861, to “Les Enfants du Sud.” It is fiery"
681,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and eloquent of passion.
682,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
683,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Enfants du Sud, l’outrage et la menace"
684,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Aux nobles coeurs ne laissent plus de choix.
685,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Le paix nous trompe: un serpent nous enlace
686,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Tranchons ses noeuds, et defendons nos droits!"
687,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Qu’attendrons--nous pour reprendre l’epee,"
688,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Qui triompha d’un vieux monde oppresseur?
689,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Le nord aussi, violant la foi juree,"
690,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Seme a son tour discorde et deshonneur.
691,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Aux armes donc pour la cause sacree;
692,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,De nos ayeux vengeons les saintes lois;
693,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Nous sommes Sparte, invincible, eprouvee;"
694,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Que sa vertu preside a nos exploits!
695,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
696,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Gilmore Simms’ poem is less a call to arms, and more a warm and"
697,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"affectionate tribute to a beloved land, noteworthy because it proves"
698,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"that even before the Confederacy was formed, the people of the South"
699,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,were united in her love. The second stanza is better than the first.
700,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
701,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,She is all fondness to her friends: to foes
702,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"She glows a thing of passion, strength and pride;"
703,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"She feels no tremors when the danger’s nigh,"
704,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"But the fight over, and the victory won,"
705,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,How with strange fondness turns her loving eye
706,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,In tearful welcome on each gallant son!
707,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
708,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,*       *       *       *       *
709,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
710,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"I glory that my lot with her is cast,"
711,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,And my soul flushes and exultant sings;
712,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
713,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Already there had begun the actual war verse, taking here the form"
714,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the invitation to arms. That war, the “irrepressible conflict,”"
715,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was inevitable, was recognized by all sensible men. “Barhamville” in"
716,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"January addressed one of the first of these, “The Call,” to the editor"
717,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the _South Carolinian_. At this time, too, there appeared the fervid"
718,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Spirit of ’60,” in the Columbus _Times_, forerunner of a series in"
719,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,which were contrasted the spirit of the present and of ’76. To the
720,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"South, both were wars for liberty, both struggles against oppression,"
721,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,in both contests the South was a vital factor; and the analogy was too
722,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,good for a poetic eye to miss.
723,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
724,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The finest single poem produced in this preliminary stage of the
725,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"contest was that by Henry Timrod, “Ethnogenesis,” written during the"
726,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"meeting of the first Southern Congress, at Montgomery, in the early"
727,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,days of February. To the poet the Congress meant indeed the birth of a
728,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"great nation, a nation among nations, strong in its right, and secure"
729,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in national resource,"
730,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
731,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,“marshalled by the Lord of Hosts
732,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,And overshadowed by the mighty ghosts
733,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Of Moultrie and of Eutaw.”
734,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
735,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,It is a noble utterance and its dignity and melody of expression must
736,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,have added greatly to the deep impression it created. In the _Southern
737,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Literary Messenger_ for the month there are Joseph Brennan’s “Ballad
738,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"for the Young South”--“Men of the South! our foes are up, in fierce and"
739,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"grim array,”--and the defiant “The Southland Fears No Foeman,” by J. W."
740,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"M., in which is the richly suggestive line, “Her eagles yet are free;”"
741,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"while “from the Georgia papers,” under date of Atlanta, February first,"
742,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,there is the anonymous “Cotton States’ Farewell to Yankee Doodle.” This
743,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,latter is especially interesting because it is one of the first of a
744,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,“Farewell to Brother Jonathan” group which enjoyed considerable vogue
745,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,during the late winter and which was answered in the North by Oliver
746,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Wendell Holmes, with the lines “Brother Jonathan’s Lament for Sister"
747,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Caroline,” under date of March 25. Of the Confederate poems on this"
748,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"theme, “Farewell to Brother Jonathan” by “Caroline,” which appeared"
749,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,about this time seems closely connected with Holmes’ verses. The metre
750,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the two poems is the same and the thought antithetic, although"
751,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,it would be difficult to determine which is the reply. The last two
752,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,stanzas of “Farewell to Brother Jonathan” are particularly good.
753,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
754,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"O Brother! beware how you seek us again,"
755,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Lest you brand on your forehead the signet of Cain;
756,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,That blood and that crime on your conscience must sit;
757,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"We may fail, we may perish, but never submit!"
758,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
759,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The pathway that leads to the Pharisee’s door
760,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"We remember, indeed, but we tread it no more;"
761,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Preferring to turn, with the Publican’s faith,"
762,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,To the path through the valley and shadow of death.
763,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
764,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Three other poems, apparently of this month, should be mentioned in"
765,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"passing, as exemplifying the note of personal interest of the Southern"
766,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,poet in the issue of the struggle. Robert Joselyn’s “Gather! Gather!”
767,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the anonymous war song, “Come, Brothers! You are called!” and Millie"
768,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Mayfield’s triumphant “We Come! We Come!” may not be poetry of the
769,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,first order: nevertheless these are verses written by people to whom
770,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the threatened conflict is not a matter distant and aloof, but of"
771,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,intimate and vital concern.
772,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
773,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,March was a month of little action on both sides. In the North it
774,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,witnessed the inauguration of Lincoln; in the South the completer
775,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"organizing and unification of the Confederacy, and the beginning of"
776,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,negotiations by the Confederacy by which they might secure possession
777,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of Fort Sumter. If, however, the South was marking time, her poets were"
778,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,not. They continued to urge her on to fulfillment of her “destiny.”
779,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Indeed, this month saw written some of the very best and most resolute"
780,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of her war verse. There is the indignant “Coercion,” by John C."
781,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Thompson--
782,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
783,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,“Who talks of Coercion? Who dares to deny
784,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,A resolute people the right to be free?”
785,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
786,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"There is the anonymous “Prosopopeia,” also in the _Southern Literary"
787,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Messenger_, which with Timrod’s “Cry to Arms,” written a little later,"
788,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,is the best of the verse of this kind which the period produced.
789,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Another widely known poem of the month was St. George Tucker’s “The
790,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Southern Cross,” verses patterned after Key’s “Star Spangled Banner,”"
791,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and which had enormous vogue, and was even set to music, later on. This"
792,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,in so far as can be determined is the first poetic use of the Southern
793,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Cross as the symbol of the Confederacy, a figure that was later adopted"
794,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"for the design of her flag, and which finally became, not only her"
795,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"ensign, but as well a symbol of the righteousness of her faith and"
796,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"cause. James Barron Hope’s “Oath of Freedom,”--"
797,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
798,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Born free, thus we resolve to live:"
799,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"By Heaven, we will be free."
800,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"By all the stars which burn on high,"
801,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,By the green earth--the mighty sea--
802,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,By God’s unshaken majesty
803,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,We will be free or die!--
804,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
805,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"is of a kind with Thompson’s “Coercion,” and was widely copied during"
806,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"this time. Another poem must be mentioned here, as presaging the"
807,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"turmoil to follow, “Fort Sumter,” by “H.,” in the New Orleans _Delta_,"
808,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"with the command of its refrain, “Carolina, _take_ the Fort.”"
809,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
810,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The most eventful months of the year 1861 were April and July, for"
811,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"April inaugurated “the irrepressible conflict,” and July saw the first"
812,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"great battle of the war, and a complete Confederate victory. On the"
813,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"first of April, President Lincoln announced his decision to refuse"
814,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"surrender of Fort Sumter to the Confederates, and added that he would"
815,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,undertake to provision the garrison imprisoned there immediately. At
816,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"once the South was aflame. On the morning of the twelfth of April,"
817,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Beauregard, commander of the Southern forces at Charleston, ordered"
818,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the shelling of the Fort, which continued through the thirteenth, and"
819,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,ended with the evacuation of the Fort on the fourteenth. The war had
820,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"begun, and though the opening engagement had been without loss to"
821,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"either side, and had ended in a Confederate victory, a far bloodier and"
822,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"disastrous conflict was inevitable. To the rejoicing South, however,"
823,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"there was only the glory of the first decision to consider, and the"
824,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"poets in their rapture gave utterance to a sheaf of verse, innumerable"
825,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"ballads about Sumter, affectionate odes to the nation so gloriously"
826,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"born and baptized by victorious fire, two great national songs, and"
827,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"frantic appeals to North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland, Tennessee and"
828,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Kentucky to join fortunes of the Confederacy.
829,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
830,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The first song published in the South after the war began, and"
831,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"corresponding, in the North, to E. C. Stedman’s “The Twelfth of April”"
832,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was, fittingly enough, “God Save the South” by George H. Miles of"
833,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Frederick County, Maryland. Sung to music by C. W. A. Ellerbrock, it"
834,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was designed to be, and accepted as the national hymn. It did not"
835,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"however, succeed in becoming a favorite. On the twenty-sixth of the"
836,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"month, James Rider Randall, inflamed by the circumstances of the"
837,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Baltimore Massacre” on April nineteenth, wrote his “My Maryland,” the"
838,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"most famous Southern poem produced by the war, and one whose influence"
839,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,was greater than a hundred battles. Circulated at first by broadsides
840,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"it swept through the South like wildfire, and if any force could have"
841,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"drawn Maryland to the side of the Confederacy, it would have been that"
842,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"exerted by this poem. Her Union Governor, however, aided by Federal"
843,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"troops and tactful advice from Washington, succeeded in holding the"
844,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"State to the Union, although many Marylanders were ardent Southern"
845,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"sympathizers. Virginia, on the other hand, who, like Maryland, had been"
846,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"hesitating over her decision, hesitated no longer, after the episode"
847,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of Sumter, implying as it did, Federal coercion. On the seventeenth"
848,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of April she seceded from the Union. Her “pausing” had long been
849,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"considered a shame and a reproach by Southern poets. Now, they burst"
850,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"forth in delight. “Virginia, Late But Sure!” was the triumphant shout"
851,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of Dr. Holcombe, and Virginia’s answer was expressed in poems such as"
852,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Virginia to the Rescue,” “Virginia’s Rallying Call,” or “Virginia’s"
853,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Message to the Southern States.”
854,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
855,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The poetry produced or published in May chiefly concerns the decision
856,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of Virginia, and the assembling of the Southern armies, those “Ordered"
857,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Away” to the field. Virginia’s entrance into the Confederacy had burnt
858,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,all the bridges leading back--though remotely--to peace. At once the
859,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"South proceeded to rally her forces to the standard of her cause,"
860,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and gradually during May and June, flung out her battle line across"
861,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky to the Mississippi. Down the"
862,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,river it stretched through Forts Henry and Donelson to New Orleans. At
863,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"one time, in ’63, the Confederate line surged forward through Western"
864,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Virginia and Maryland so far into Pennsylvania that Harrisburg was
865,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,directly menaced. It was the four years’ uncertain task of the Union
866,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"forces to control this line, to break through it, turn it back and"
867,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in upon itself, and finally to starve its scattered remnants into"
868,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,submission. As this was accomplished the first lyric outburst of the
869,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"War--Timrod’s “Cry to Arms,” for example--was gradually exchanged for"
870,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,a slenderer volume of song. At first her poets encouraged the people
871,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"to faith and labor; then they sang of hope and courage, attempting to"
872,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"relieve the despair of a nation whose cause was lost, and whose ruin"
873,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,seemed irretrievable.

876,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"North the cry of “On to Richmond” welled and grew fiercer during May,"
877,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,June and the summer months. Especially did it grow imperative after
878,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"July twentieth, when the Confederate Capital was transferred there from"
879,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Montgomery. On the next day, July twenty-first, came the great opening"

881,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,with Beauregard’s men at Manassas Junction. The result was a complete
882,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Confederate victory, and there was unrestricted panic and flight among"
883,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the Federal troops (the source of much satiric comment among the
884,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Southern poets) when Joseph E. Johnston’s army, which had not been"
885,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"expected to arrive until too late to be of assistance to Beauregard,"
886,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,appeared at the crucial moment.
887,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
888,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,It was only natural that the wave of triumphant exultation which had
889,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,thrilled the South after the fall of Sumter should again sweep the
890,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"land. Her poets responded with a sheaf of poems, in which they wrote"
891,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the contest from every angle,--odes of thanksgiving for victory,"
892,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"narratives of the course of the flight, eulogies of Beauregard and"
893,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Johnston, satires on the behavior of the Union forces, camp catches"
894,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"half satiric and half comic, poems of particular incidents of the"
895,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"fight, finally words of regret and sorrow for the slain, and the manner"
896,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of their slaying. This last theme is particularly interesting, for the"
897,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,feeling of horror at the situation “where brother fought with brother”
898,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,was ever-present with the Southerners throughout the four years of
899,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the War. The very best of the poems occasioned by Manassas were those
900,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of Mrs. Warfield, “Manassas,” Susan Archer Talley’s “Battle Eve,”"
901,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Ticknor’s “Our Left,” and the lines by “Ruth,” entitled “The Battle of"
902,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Bull Run,” dated Louisville, Kentucky, July twenty-fourth, and written"

943,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of Johnston’s army, who brought victory with them, is a spirited,"
944,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"almost exalted account of the actual battle, and was immensely"
945,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"popular at the time. There are many versions of it still extant, in"
946,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"broadsides and anthologies,--for the most part anonymous, since the"
947,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,poem evidently was not at first acknowledged by Ticknor. This has led
948,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,to a curious connection of names. In one of the broadsides versions
949,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in the collection of the Ridgway Library, in Philadelphia, the poem"
950,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"is dated Baltimore, Maryland, October 20, 1861, and is signed by “Old"
951,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Secesh.” This signature is also given to “The Despot’s Song,” a popular"
952,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Lincoln satire of a later period of the War, which again is assigned to"
953,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Baltimore, and from circumstantial evidence seems to be the work of Dr."
954,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"N. G. Ridgely, a Baltimorean who was a popular satirist of the day, and"
955,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"who signed his work variously “N. G. R.,” “Le Diable Baiteux,” “O. H."
956,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"S.,” “Cola,” and “B.” This last signature is further associated with"
957,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the name of James Ryder Randall, for in the Baltimore City Librarian’s"
958,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Office, in Ledger 1411, there is a broadside version of “Maryland, My"
959,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Maryland,” published in Baltimore, as were these other broadsides, and"
960,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"signed “B,” Point Coupee (La.), April 26, 1861. It would, of course,"
961,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"be impossible, so many years later, to puzzle out the interrelation of"
962,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the poems and signatures, and indeed their value would hardly warrant"
963,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the labor. It is, nevertheless, an interesting example of the chaos"
964,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,which at times arose from the necessarily surreptitious publication and
965,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,circulation of the Confederate verse.
966,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
967,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Manassas was the last great event of the year. There were several minor
968,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"engagements between the two armies, notably the fight at Ball’s Bluff,"
969,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"on the twenty-first of October; and there was the “Trent Affair,”"
970,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"with the capture of the Confederate emissaries to England, Mason and"
971,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Slidell, on November eighth. Nevertheless, the Southern poets did not"
972,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"lack inspiring material, the continued “aloofness” of Maryland and"
973,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Kentucky being among their most vital themes. They were, of course,"
974,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,never idle with their lyrics of loyalty and continued to sound the war
975,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"note or to sing of the South, with indomitable zeal. They had even by"
976,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"this time, become so accustomed to the state of war, that they could"
977,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,begin to work seriously with satire. The best in this genre written
978,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in ’61 are John R. Thompson’s “On to Richmond,” satirizing Winfield"
979,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Scott’s first campaign, and “England’s Neutrality” (England had passed"
980,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"a proclamation of neutrality towards the two belligerents early in May,"
981,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"on the thirteenth): “O Johnny Bull, My Jo John,” an anonymous ballad"
982,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"occasioned by the presence of English frigates off the coast in ’61,"
983,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and the unfortunately anonymous, but delightfully humorous “King Scare”"

986,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
987,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The close of the year was marked by a poem in the _Southern Field
988,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and Fireside_--a “Requiem for 1861,” by H. C. B. It is not of any"
989,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"particular excellence or poetic merit, but it is worthy of note for its"
990,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,expression of sincere sorrow for the conflict that was severing a land

1026,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in the year just passed, the South was resolved on whatever sacrifice"
1027,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"it might cost her to prevail, despite the fact that she was already"

1033,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1034,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"1862 began with the Confederacy prevailing. Nevertheless, the first"
1035,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,six months of the year seemed to bring to the South nothing but gloom.
1036,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"In February of ’62, came news of the capture of Fort Henry on the"
1037,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Tennessee River, February sixth, and on February eighth, of the fall"
1038,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland. There was much more importance in"
1039,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,these two defeats than at first appeared to the poets; for these forts
1040,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"were the two most valuable gateways to the Southwestern Confederacy,"
1041,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and their fall meant not only the first break in the Confederate line,"
1042,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"but as well, direct menace of Southern control of the Mississippi, and"
1043,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"New Orleans. It foreshadowed the later evacuation of Nashville, before"
1044,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Grant.
1045,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1046,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"In January, the month before, the chief theme of the Southern poets"
1047,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"had been the meditated burning of the cotton crop, by the Southern"
1048,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"planters, and this cry of “Burn the Cotton!” had brought forth at"
1049,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"least one finely phrased poem. In February, the themes concerned the"
1050,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"siege and evacuation of Donelson, and there began the days of wretched"
1051,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"anxiety that were to possess the Confederacy until the end of July,"
1052,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,when the land was to know that the Virginia part of her line still
1053,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"held, and Richmond was safe. In March McClellan assumed chief control"
1054,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the Union forces, and began his Peninsula campaign, in response to"
1055,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Lincoln’s reiterated cry, “On to Richmond.” On the eighth of the month,"
1056,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Confederate ram “Merrimac” out from Norfolk, succeeded in breaking"
1057,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Federal blockade of Hampton Roads, much to the consternation of the"
1058,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"North. The next day, however, in her encounter with the “cheesebox”"
1059,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Monitor, “the turtle” Merrimac was too badly hurt to be of further"
1060,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"or immediate use, and the elation of the day before gave way to"
1061,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"depression, which was in no way relieved by the events of the next few"
1062,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"months. April saw the practical occupation of the Mississippi, with the"
1063,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"fall of Corinth, the evacuation of Fort Pillow, and on the lower river,"
1064,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Farragut and Porter’s occupation of New Orleans. Of the Mississippi
1065,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"line, there remained to the Confederates only Vicksburg and Port"
1066,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Hudson. For the South everything depended on the defeat of McClellan’s
1067,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“On to Richmond” march, since on the sixth of the month, Albert Sidney"
1068,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Johnston, attempting to retrieve the disaster to the middle line in"
1069,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Tennessee, had engaged Grant at Shiloh and Pittsburgh Landing, with"
1070,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,tremendous carnage. The battle had proved an incomplete Confederate
1071,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"defeat, but what was worse for the South, had occasioned Johnston’s"
1072,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,death.
1073,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1074,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"To all of the many events of these opening months, the Southern poets"
1075,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"made continuous response. National songs inspiring faith and courage,"
1076,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"as for example, Hewitt’s “Lines Written During These Gloomy Times, To"
1077,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Him Who Despairs,” spoken at the Richmond “Varieties” by Mr. Ogden,"
1078,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Wednesday night, May 7, 1862,--occasional verses suggested by various"
1079,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"incidents and episodes of the war’s progress, camp catches and marching"
1080,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"ballads praising individual troops and regiments, the poets poured"
1081,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"forth in unstinting measure. However, the death of Albert Sidney"
1082,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Johnston, at Shiloh, made a deeper impression on the poets than any"
1083,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,event of these spring months. The affection and pure love which the
1084,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Southerners lavished on their leaders is one of the several remarkable
1085,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"phenomena of the war. In no other war, and in no other country do the"
1086,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"leaders appear to have been so beloved, so idolized. To us today, the"
1087,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,expression of sentiment seems extravagant and excessive. One attribute
1088,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"it has, however, and one that is not to be denied. The praise of the"
1089,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"South for her great men is always passionately sincere. During the war,"
1090,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Southerners were, as never before, a band of brothers. There was,"
1091,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"therefore, in their relations with their great men, a personal contact"
1092,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and appeal which in the North was not so keenly felt. Albert Sidney
1093,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Johnston, who with Beauregard, had been one of the heroes of Manassas,"
1094,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was the first of Confederate heroes to fall. The South mourned him, as"
1095,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"she did all of her sons who fell in her defence, truly and warmly."
1096,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1097,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"When “Stonewall” Jackson died, after Chancellorsville, almost a"
1098,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"year later, the outburst of the poets with dirges and elegies was"
1099,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"quite typical. S. A. Link quotes T. C. de Leon, the editor of _South"
1100,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Songs_ (1866), as saying:[13] “I had in my collection no fewer than"
1101,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"forty-seven monodies and dirges on Stonewall Jackson, some dozen on"
1102,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Ashby, and a score on Stuart.” Even today there are extant a round"
1103,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,dozen of poems lamenting the death of Albert Sidney Johnston.
1104,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1105,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,With all the sorrow that came to the South in these first months of
1106,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"depression, it is pleasant to see that she had not lost the saving"
1107,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,humor and satiric sense that was so to strengthen her in the evil
1108,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"days which followed. On April sixteenth, for example, the Confederate"
1109,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Congress, alarmed by the condition of the Southern army, passed a"
1110,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,measure for conscription. This was commented upon in the _Southern
1111,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Literary Messenger_ for the month, with a delightful epigram:"
1112,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1113,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Let us hail in this crisis the prosperous omen
1114,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,That our senate shows virtue higher than Roman;
1115,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"It has spurned all titles of honor, for rather"
1116,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Than claim that each member be called “Conscript Father,”"
1117,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"All self-aggrandizement they lay on the shelves,"
1118,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"And declare all men conscripts, excepting themselves!"
1119,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1120,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,During May and June of ’62 Jackson and Lee endeavored to arrest
1121,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,McClellan’s progress by their counter campaign in the Shenandoah. For
1122,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the South it was a most successful move. Not only were the Southern
1123,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"arms carried to victory, but, through the unfortunate wounding of"
1124,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Joseph E. Johnston at Seven Pines, Lee, whose fame had grown in the"
1125,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Shenandoah, was placed in supreme command of the army of Northern"
1126,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Virginia. The turning point of the Southern fortunes had arrived. The
1127,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"battle of the Chickahominy, Malvern Hill, and the Seven Day’s fighting"
1128,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"before Richmond, resulted in the defeat of McClellan’s campaign, and"
1129,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Richmond, for the next two years, was saved."
1130,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1131,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The army of the Confederacy, through the hardships and reverses of the"
1132,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"first year of fighting, had become a seasoned and experienced (though,"
1133,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"thanks to the blockade, a sadly ill-equipped) machine. Its three great"
1134,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,leaders were Lee and Jackson and Beauregard. The Southerners at home
1135,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,were beginning to be accustomed to the privations of war. They were
1136,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,all as confident as ever of the righteousness of their war. Thus with
1137,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,a united Confederacy behind him and after another victory at “Second
1138,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Manassas,” in ’62, Lee began his ill-starred Maryland campaign, as"
1139,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,a counter-stroke against the Army of the Potomac. Lee’s part of the
1140,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Confederate line, the Army of Northern Virginia, was the only part of"
1141,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the original battle wall still intact. Butler and his forces were in
1142,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"possession of New Orleans, the fall of Vicksburg, already in siege, was"
1143,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"but a matter of time, and in the West, uncertainty still prevailed."
1144,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"John R. Thompson’s spirited “A Word to the West,” was written when"
1145,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Joseph E. Johnston was dispatched to relieve Vicksburg. It was at the
1146,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"same time an answer to A. J. Requier’s impassioned plea, “Clouds in the"
1147,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,West.”
1148,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1149,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Those were anxious days, indeed. September saw the desperate conflict"
1150,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"at Sharpsburg, the bloodiest single day’s battle of the war, which,"
1151,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"although it was not a conclusive defeat, left the Confederate forces"
1152,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"wretchedly crippled, and brought deepest anguish to the South."
1153,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The gloom, however, was relieved in December by Lee’s victory at"
1154,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Fredericksburg. So the second year of war closed on a people and a
1155,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"nation, whose hearts were sick of the conflict. A second Christmas came"
1156,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,to the Confederacy to find only the grim realities of life instead of
1157,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the plumes and pomp of circumstance with which the war had begun. Mrs.

1161,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,And yet it is Christmas in nothing but name:
1162,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,No merry expression we utter today--
1163,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"How can we, with hearts that refuse to be gay?"
1164,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,We look back a twelfthmonth on many a brow
1165,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,That graced the home hearthstone--and where are they now?
1166,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"We think of the darling ones clustering there,"
1167,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"But we see, through our tears, an untenanted chair."
1168,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1169,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"None the less, the South was still firm in her resolve to battle to"
1170,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the end. No sacrifice could be demanded so great that it would not be
1171,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,willingly offered on the altar of Liberty--
1172,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1173,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Thank God! there is joy in the sorrow for all--
1174,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,He fell--but it surely was blessed to fall;

1180,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"1863 proved another “Year of terror, year of strife.” In the far South,"
1181,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Butler, in possession of New Orleans, had begun his reign of terror"

1213,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Spring brought with it another bloody engagement and Confederate
1214,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"victory, the Battle of Chancellorsville, fought in the first four days"
1215,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of May. In that, however, it caused the death of Stonewall Jackson it"
1216,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was, next to the actual surrender of the Southern army, the worst blow"
1217,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Confederacy could have sustained. His death, some one once said,"
1218,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was like the death of an army. Certainly it took from Lee, already"
1219,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"overburdened, his good right hand."
1220,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1221,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The outburst of mourning that followed on Jackson’s death, has already"
1222,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"been noted. The South and her poets loved him, not only as a leader,"
1223,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"but personally, as a great and good man. He represented, moreover, that"
1224,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,element of faith and religious fervor which was one of the essential
1225,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"factors of the Southern character, and without which the faith that"
1226,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"sustained the Confederacy through four years of war, and the days of"
1227,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"ruin that followed, is inexplicable."
1228,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1229,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Let me say,” wrote Dr. Gildersleeve,[15] “that the bearing of the"
1230,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Confederates is not to be understood without taking into account
1231,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the deep religious feeling of the army and its great leaders. It is
1232,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"a historical element, like any other, and is not to be passed over"
1233,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in summing up the forces of the conflict.” Many are the poems, the"
1234,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Prayers for the South,” and the individual supplications which still"
1235,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"remain to attest the fact. For example, there is the “Battle Hymn of"
1236,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Virginia Soldier,” an anonymous lyric of striking beauty. There is"
1237,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the simpler, yet equally sincere and devout “Soldier’s Battle Prayer”"
1238,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"from the _Southern Literary Messenger_ for April, ’62. “A Mother’s"
1239,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Prayer,” is another very touching poem, in the same theme: and there"
1240,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,could be no more impressive evidence of the true religious strain in
1241,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Southern hearts, than the verses, terrible in their satire, and burning"
1242,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in their indignant phrases, “The War Christians’ Thanksgiving,” by"
1243,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"S. Teackle Wallis of Maryland, occasioned by the Union proclamation"
1244,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"for a day of prayer in the North, and “Respectfully Dedicated to the"
1245,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"War-Clergy of the United States, Bishops, Priests and Deacons.”"
1246,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Written as it was by a prisoner then in the dungeon of Fort Warren, it"
1247,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,is one of the most powerful human documents of the War. At the same
1248,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"time, the South held her own days of national prayer and fasting: and"
1249,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the verses which her poets wrote on these occasions, were quite in"
1250,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,character with the national temper.
1251,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1252,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"In the dark days of the next two years, the South was to find need"
1253,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,for all her faith and confidence in the right. As if Jackson’s death
1254,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was not sufficient evil, July first to third brought Lee’s defeat at"
1255,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Gettysburg, and on the day after this battle, the fall of Vicksburg, on"
1256,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the Mississippi. This meant the complete breaking of the Confederate
1257,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"line in the Southwest, and the return of the Army of Northern Virginia"
1258,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,to its original position in Virginia. To complete the rout of the
1259,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Confederate line, the Union forces now began to beat through the"
1260,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Southern defense in Tennessee and Kentucky, while Lee, back once more"
1261,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in Virginia, maneuvered to and fro against Meade. In the Southern"
1262,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"campaign, the Confederates were steadily forced out of Tennessee, and"
1263,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Chattanooga, the objective of the Union troops. This, (which was with"
1264,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Richmond, the last important strategic point left to the Confederacy)"
1265,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was wrested from Bragg, and occupied by Rosecrans on the ninth. The"
1266,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,latter thought that the fall of the city would be sufficient warning
1267,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"to the Southerner, and that he and his forces would at once withdraw."
1268,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Far from doing that, however, Bragg engaged him, ten days later,"
1269,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"at Chickamauga. It was a two days’ battle, on the nineteenth and"
1270,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"twentieth, and was, next to Sharpsburg, the bloodiest engagement of"
1271,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the War. Though a Confederate victory, it was dearly bought. Yet even"
1272,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"after all her suffering, the South willingly paid the price. Verses in"
1273,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Richmond _Sentinel_ called the river “Chickamauga, The Stream of"

1306,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Confederates were set in full flight. J. Augustine Signaigo described
1307,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,this fight in “The Heights of Mission Ridge.” The final catastrophe had
1308,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,begun.
1309,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1310,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"It had been threatening for a long time. By the end of ’63, nearly"

1362,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1363,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,1864 was a year to be endured in stricken anguish. After a comparative
1364,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"lull during the first months of the war, on the fourth of May three"
1365,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Union armies moved forward, two destined for Richmond to shatter what"

1367,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Atlanta against Johnston and Hood, setting out to employ the troops"
1368,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"still in the far South, and keep them from the relief of Lee and"
1369,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Richmond. This latter campaign was to end in the fall of Atlanta, and"
1370,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Sherman’s March to the Sea,” and caused the invention of a new word."

1383,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"poignantly, “Savannah,” written in encouragement when her ruin seemed"

1387,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"On the way to Savannah, Sherman’s route had lain through Columbia,"

1389,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"savage inspiration of James Barron Hope’s flaming verses, “A Poem"
1390,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,that Needs No Dedication.” The sack of Columbia caused the evacuation
1391,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of Charleston by the Confederate forces, then directly menaced, and"
1392,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,before the oncoming destroyer the city was deserted. The pitiful fate
1393,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of the city which had witnessed the birth and earliest days of the
1394,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Confederacy, could not fail to stir the anguish of the Southern poets."

1402,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1403,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,To save her proud soul from that loathed thrall

1417,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1418,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"To the poets of the South, the fate of this city was particularly"
1419,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"significant, for if any place may be said to have been the literary"
1420,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"centre of the Confederacy, it was Charleston. There, for example,"
1421,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"lived Simms and Timrod and Hayne, the leaders of her lyrists, who,"
1422,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in the general destruction of the city, suffered the loss of their"
1423,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"homes and libraries. Had Charleston been spared to them and to others,"
1424,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the literary history of the South in the days after the war might
1425,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"have been a different tale. As it was, the disaster to each of these"
1426,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,particular men proved irretrievable.
1427,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1428,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Lee, during the summer months, though stoutly resisting, and adroitly"
1429,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"circumventing the enemy at nearly every turn, was nevertheless being"
1430,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"forced back against Richmond. The Battles of the Wilderness, May fifth"
1431,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and sixth, the Spottsylvania fighting, on the eighth to the twentieth,"
1432,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and Cold Harbor, on June third, resulted in advantage first to one"
1433,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,side and to the other. Then the conflict swung below Richmond to
1434,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Petersburg, and for the next month, the Union forces were halted before"
1435,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,that strongly fortified town. The “Battle of the Crater” was fought
1436,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"on July thirtieth, over ground destroyed by Federal mines, but it was"
1437,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"unsuccessful for the Unionists, and their losses were so terrific that"
1438,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"for the next winter, at least, Richmond was safe."
1439,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1440,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The Petersburg siege is noteworthy since during it were written some of
1441,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the most attractive lyrics of the war, like “Dreaming in the Trenches,”"
1442,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"by Gordon McCabe, and “A Bloody Day is Dawning,” by William Munford."
1443,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,It is remarkable that such freshness of phrase could be given to men
1444,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,wearied by three years of disappointing struggle. One may imagine that
1445,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,this is but another indication of the vitality and spirit that was an

1447,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1448,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"By the end of ’64, the Confederate battle wall had been crumpled and"
1449,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was beaten in, everywhere except in Virginia, before Richmond. Peace"
1450,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,for a stricken land was the immediate concern alike of poets and
1451,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,people. Beyond that they did not trust themselves to think: but peace
1452,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,was the universal prayer.
1453,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1454,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Peace! Peace! God of our fathers, grant us Peace!"
1455,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Peace in our hearts, and at Thine altars; Peace"
1456,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,On the red waters and their blighted shores;
1457,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Peace for the leaguered cities, and the hosts"
1458,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"That watch and bleed, around them and within;"
1459,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Peace for the homeless and the fatherless;
1460,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Peace for the captive on his weary way,"
1461,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,And the mad crowds who jeer his helplessness.
1462,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"For them that suffer, them that do the wrong--"
1463,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Sinning and sinned against--O, God! for all--"
1464,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"For a distracted, torn and bleeding land--"
1465,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Speed the glad tidings! Give us, give us Peace.[17]"
1466,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1467,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The end came quickly. After a winter of preparation, determined among"
1468,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Union forces, despairing among Lee’s men, the attack on Petersburg"
1469,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was resumed and carried on April second, of ’65. The next day, Richmond"
1470,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"fell. Lee found escape impossible, and on the twelfth the little white"
1471,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"farmhouse at Appomattox Court House, in the meeting of Lee and Grant,"
1472,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,witnessed at once the death of a young nation and the rebirth of an
1473,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,older one.
1474,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1475,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Lyric as had always been the poetic genius of the South, it was but"
1476,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,natural that her anguished cry of despair and defeat should be put into
1477,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the mouths of her poets. For the most part, the poems on this theme are"
1478,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of beautiful quality, and those still extant form the largest single"
1479,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"class in the war poetry of the four years.[18] Correspondingly, they"
1480,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"constitute a glass wherein one may see how defeat came to the South,"
1481,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and how she met the challenge of the issue. There were, of course, some"
1482,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,spirits which cried out beneath the unendurable prick that death itself
1483,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,had been preferable to defeat. There is not emotion more appalling
1484,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,than despair for which one sees no relieving element of comfort. Such
1485,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"poems as “Stack Arms,” by Joseph Blythe Alston, “Doffing the Gray,”"
1486,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"by Lieutenant Falligant, “The Price of Peace” by “Luola” or “Peace”"
1487,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,by Alethea Burroughs of Savannah are terrible expressions of this
1488,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"attitude. At the same time, there were those who like Mrs. Preston, in"
1489,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Acceptation,” met the issue more bravely and gently:"
1490,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1491,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"We do accept thee, heavenly Peace!"
1492,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Albeit thou comest in a guise
1493,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Unlooked for--undesired, our eyes"
1494,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Welcome, thro’ tears, the kind release"
1495,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,From war and woe and want--surcease
1496,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"For which we bless thee, holy Peace!"
1497,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1498,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,We lift our foreheads from the dust;
1499,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"And as we meet thy brow’s clear calm,"
1500,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,There falls a freshening sense of balm
1501,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Upon our spirits. Fear--distrust--
1502,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The hopeless present on us thrust--
1503,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"We’ll front them as we can, and must."
1504,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,

1506,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1507,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Then courage, brothers! Tho’ our breast"
1508,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Ache with that rankling thorn, despair,"
1509,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,That failure plants so sharply there--

1511,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"We’ll work and watch the brightening west,"
1512,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"And leave to God and Heaven, the rest."
1513,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1514,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"There were others who accepted the inevitable gracefully, but defiantly."
1515,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1516,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Weep, if thou wilt, with proud sad mien,"
1517,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Thy blasted hopes--thy peace undone;

1524,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Thy chains--_Virginia victrix_ still.[19]
1525,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1526,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,There were yet others to whom the fall of the Confederacy was typified
1527,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"in the furling of its banner. Poems like “The Conquered Banner,”"
1528,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"by Father Ryan, and J. C. M.’s “Cruci Dum Spiro, Fido,” and A. J."
1529,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Requier’s “Ashes of Glory” are typical expressions of such spirits.
1530,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Then there were those who, like D. B. Lucas, “In the Land Where We Were"
1531,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Dreaming,” began to regard the struggle as the passing of a spirit"
1532,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,world with which had passed all chivalry and beauty.
1533,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1534,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"There are many of these verses portraying the end, each slightly"
1535,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"differing in spirit from the one before, each repaying careful study"
1536,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"with the beauty of its melody, and as a class, forming the noblest"
1537,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"group of the war poems, whose only companions may be the earliest of"
1538,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the “Cry to Arms” series. Yet these poems of defeat are infinitely the
1539,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,more appealing in that the fire and dash of the earlier verses has here
1540,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,given way to the dignity of sorrow. “For the people’s hopes are dead.”
1541,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1542,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Hundreds of poems written during the four years of conflict reflect
1543,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"either individual reactions to war conditions, or incidents of battle."
1544,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Besides these there are the prison verses, humorous pieces, and"
1545,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the southern songs, which in no way concern the historical passage"
1546,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the War. There are poems of personal feeling, for example, like"
1547,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the exquisite and tender “The Confederate Soldier’s Wife Parting
1548,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"From Her Husband” or Major S. Y. Levy’s “Love Letter,” or Fanny"
1549,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Downing’s “Dreaming.” There are poems that picture the life of the
1550,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"civilian population, like “The Homespun Dress” by Miss Sinclair, or"
1551,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the anonymous “Your Mission” which is of more than passing interest
1552,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"since in the South it was attributed equally to John R. Thompson,"
1553,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Mrs. Preston, Paul H. Hayne, and Mrs. Browning.[20] There are poems"
1554,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"reflecting the ravages of the war on the families of the soldiers,"
1555,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"like “Heart Victories,” “Somebody’s Darling,” “Reading the List,”"
1556,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Volunteered,” and “The Unreturning.” One could continue the catalogue"
1557,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,indefinitely.
1558,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1559,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The prison verse, while not extensive, is for the most part, of"
1560,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,good quality. There are five men whose work may be considered as
1561,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"representative, S. Teackle Wallis, who was imprisoned at Fort Warren,"
1562,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and four at Johnson’s Island. Wallis’s “To The Exchanged Prisoners”
1563,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was written in Fort Warren in July ’62, and is one of the first of the"
1564,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"prison poems which we can identify as such. The others, Major A. S."
1565,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Hawkins, Colonel Beuhring H. Jones, Colonel W. W. Fontaine, and Major"
1566,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"George McKnight, (“Asa Hartz,”) wrote two years later, in ’64 and"
1567,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"’65. Hawkins was the author of many poems, all of them popular, “The"
1568,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Hero Without a Name,” “To Infidelia,” “True to the Last,” “Give Up,”"
1569,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,“A Prisoner’s Fancy.” About the best known of Beuhring Jones’ verses
1570,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"were “To a Dear Comforter,” and the rather humorous “Rat den Linden.”"
1571,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Fontaine was the author of many poems, notably “The Countersign,”"
1572,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Virginia Desolate,” and “The Cliff Beside the Sea.” It remained"
1573,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,for “Asa Hartz” to while away his prison hours in writing lines so
1574,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"delightfully humorous, so free and swift moving, that it is difficult"
1575,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,to believe they could have been written within prison walls. “Living or
1576,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Dying,” “Will No One Write to Me?” “To Exchange-Commissioner Ould,” and"
1577,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“My Love and I” are among the best of his lighter verses: “Exchanged,”"
1578,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and “Farewell to Johnson’s Island” are of more sober temper. “My Love
1579,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and I” is the best example of his work:
1580,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1581,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,My love reposes on a rosewood frame--
1582,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,A bunk have I;
1583,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,A couch of feathery down fills up the same--
1584,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Mine’s straw, but dry;"
1585,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,She sinks to sleep at night with scarce a sigh--
1586,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,With waking eyes I watch the hours creep by.
1587,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1588,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,My love her daily dinner takes in state--
1589,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,And so do I (?);
1590,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,The richest viands flank her silver plate--
1591,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Course grub have I.
1592,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Pure wines she sips at ease, her thirst to slake--"
1593,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,I pump my drink from Erie’s limpid lake!
1594,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1595,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,My love has all the world at will to roam--
1596,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Three acres I;
1597,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"She goes abroad, or quiet sits at home--"
1598,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,So cannot I;
1599,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Bright angels watch around her couch at night--
1600,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"A Yank, with loaded gun, keeps me in sight."
1601,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1602,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,A thousand weary miles do stretch between
1603,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,My love and I;
1604,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"To her, this wintry night, cool, calm, serene,"
1605,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,I waft a sigh;
1606,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"And hope with all my earnestness of soul,"
1607,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Tomorrow’s mail may bring me my parole!
1608,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1609,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,There’s hope ahead! We’ll one day meet again--
1610,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,My love and I;
1611,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"We’ll wipe away all tears of sorrow then,"
1612,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Her lovelit eye
1613,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Will all my many troubles then beguile,"
1614,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,And keep this wayward reb. from Johnston’s Isle.
1615,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1616,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The poetry dealing with incidents of the war is varied, and touches"
1617,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"many subjects. There were such verses for example, as “The Silent"
1618,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"March,” by Walker Meriweather Bell, written on an occasion during the"
1619,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,war when General Lee was lying asleep by the wayside and an army of
1620,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"fifteen thousand men “passed by with hushed voices and footsteps, lest"
1621,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"they should disturb his slumbers;” “Stonewall Jackson’s Way,” written"
1622,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,on the theme of the great general’s ability “always to be where needed
1623,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"and in the thick of things;” “The Lone Sentry,” based on an incident,"
1624,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"common to all wars, of the great general relieving a weary sentry;"
1625,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“The Battle Rainbow” by John R. Thompson, inspired by the rainbow"
1626,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,that appeared the evening before the beginning of the Seven Days of
1627,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Battle before Richmond. “The rainbow overspread the eastern sky, and"
1628,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"exactly defined the position of the Confederate army, as seen from the"
1629,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Capitol at Richmond.” There were poems like “Music in Camp” also by
1630,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"John R. Thompson, suggested by an incident that occurred just after"
1631,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Chancellorsville: and “The Unknown Hero,” by W. Gordon McCabe, based on"
1632,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the discovery, “after the Battle of Malvern Hill, of a [Confederate]"
1633,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"soldier lying dead fifty yards in advance of any man or officer, his"
1634,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"musket firmly grasped in the rigid fingers, name unknown, simply ‘2 La’"
1635,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,on his cap.”
1636,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1637,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Another interesting group of poems, closely connected with the war,"
1638,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"although not with the actual progress of events, is found in the"
1639,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,national and the army songs which were sung in camp and field and by
1640,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the fire-side. It was natural that “Dixie” should be the most popular
1641,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of airs, and while it admitted of endless variations and sentiments,"
1642,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the words that were generally sung to it were those by Albert Pike.
1643,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"The Marseillaise was another widely popular air, to which were sung"
1644,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,any number of poems. One of these “The Southern Marseillaise” by A.
1645,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"E. Blackmar, written early in 1861, was sung by the troops as they"
1646,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"marched to their assembling points, and may very properly be called the"
1647,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Rallying Song of the South.
1648,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1649,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“The Bonnie Blue Flag,” by Harry Macarthy was the favorite of the"
1650,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,popular national songs. It was first sung by him on the stage of the
1651,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Academy of Music in New Orleans, in September, 1861, and caused such"
1652,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,excitement that the event precipitated a riot. When General Butler
1653,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was in command of the city, two years later, he threatened to impose"
1654,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"a fine of twenty-five dollars on any man, woman or child who sang it."
1655,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"In addition he arrested the publisher, A. E. Blackmar, destroyed the"
1656,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"sheet music, and fined him five hundred dollars. After the tune became"
1657,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"established as a favorite, Mrs. Annie Chambers Ketchum of Kentucky"
1658,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"wrote other words to the air, which were frequently used.[21] In"
1659,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"addition to the national songs, the various states used particular"
1660,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"anthems. Maryland had Randall’s song, “Maryland, My Maryland.” For"
1661,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"South Carolina there were Timrod’s noble lines in the same strain,"
1662,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Carolina.” “Georgia, My Georgia” was written by Carrie Bell Sinclair,"
1663,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and the “Song of the Texas Rangers” by Mrs. J. D. Young. These are but
1664,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,a few among a longer list.
1665,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1666,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,It has been said[22] that while the Confederate Army was not
1667,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“absolutely destitute of songs, it simply lacked a plentiful supply"
1668,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of songs written especially for the moment.” This is far from being
1669,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the case. Indeed, the camp songs and marching ballads written in the"
1670,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Confederate camps during the war, are legion. They vary in excellence"
1671,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,from “The Cavaliers’ Glee” by Captain William Blackford of Stuart’s
1672,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"staff, to the extremely popular and delightful “Goober Peas,” by A."
1673,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Pender. For the camp catches there were certain stock tunes, such as"
1674,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the “Happy Land of Canaan,” “Wait for the Wagon,” “We’ll Be Free in"
1675,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Maryland,” “Gay and Happy,” which were used over and over, and to which"
1676,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,words were improvised to fit the occasion. Even the slender Confederate
1677,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Navy had her stock of ballads. “The Alabama,” by E. King, author of"
1678,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“Naval Songs of the South,” is the best representative of this class."
1679,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1680,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"It is not strange that during the chaotic days of the Confederacy,"
1681,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,poems that had been written by Southerners in antebellum days were
1682,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,published in the South as of Confederate origin; and that poems of
1683,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the war period written in the North or abroad should be attributed
1684,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,to Confederate authors. In the first category are verses such as
1685,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"“My Wife and Child,” by Henry R. Jackson of Georgia, which he wrote"
1686,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"during the Mexican War, and in the second class, “The Soldier Boy,” a"
1687,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"widely popular poem which was really by the Englishman, Dr. William"
1688,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Maginn (1793-1842), whom Thackeray satirized as “Captain Shalow” in"
1689,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"_Pendennis_, but which was assigned to “H. M. L.” of Lynchburg, and"
1690,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"even given the circumstantial date of May 18, 1861. Another poem that"
1691,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was widely copied, but which was really written by T. Buchanan Read in"
1692,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Rome in 1861, was “The Brave at Home.”"
1693,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1694,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Two other poems whose origins have attracted much attention are “The
1695,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Confederate Note,” by Major S. A. Jonas of Mississippi, and “All Quiet"
1696,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Along the Potomac Tonight,” by Mrs. Ethel Lynn Beers. Major Jonas seems"
1697,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,to have established unquestionable claim to his poem in a letter to
1698,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the Louisville _Courier_, under date of December 11, 1889. The poem"
1699,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,by Mrs. Beers was a long time claimed for Lomar Fontaine. Mrs. Beers
1700,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"had written the verses in 1861, in which year they had appeared in"
1701,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"_Harper’s Weekly_. Late in ’62 they began to circulate in the South,"
1702,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and for some unknown reason were assigned to Lomar Fontaine. He was at
1703,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"once showered with praise and eulogy, but it is interesting to note"
1704,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,that in the Editor’s Table of the _Southern Literary Messenger_ for
1705,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"June, 1863 (p. 375) at the end of verses by Henry C. Alexander “To"
1706,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Lomar Fontaine, the author of the verses entitled ‘All Quiet Along the"
1707,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Potomac Tonight,’ and if report be true, one of the unrewarded heroes"
1708,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,of the South” the Editor has subscribed the following discriminating
1709,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,comment: “It is questionable whether Fontaine wrote the ‘All Quiet
1710,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Along the Potomac.’ There was no occasion to incite such a poem. Our
1711,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,pickets along the Potomac were rarely if ever shot: those of the
1712,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Yankees were shot night after night.[23] We have heard that the author
1713,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"of the lines attributed to Fontaine is an Ohioan. A brave man--a hero,"
1714,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"if you will,--Fontaine has yet to prove that he is a poet.”"
1715,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1716,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"One other poem whose origin has been questioned is “The Countersign,”"
1717,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"which, reprinted in the Philadelphia _Press_ in 1861, was declared"
1718,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"to have been written by a private in Company G, Stuart’s Engineer"
1719,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"Regiment, at Camp Lesley, near Washington. F. F. Browne, in _Bugle"

1721,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"was written by a Confederate soldier, still living. The third line of"
1722,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,the fifth stanza affords internal evidence of Southern origin.” This

1724,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1725,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Metrical study of the Southern war poetry leads inevitably to the
1726,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,conclusion that Southern temperament lent itself naturally to rhythmic
1727,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"expression. The poets of the South, many of them untrained in the"
1728,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"technique of their art, wrote in every metrical arrangement that can be"
1729,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"imagined, from curious irregular unrhymed rhythms to ballad measure,"
1730,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,and to the long and intricate stanzaic forms used by Simms and Timrod.
1731,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"In nearly every case, except, of course, with the cruder camp songs,"
1732,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the verses flow felicitously, and the effect is melodious. Even in the"
1733,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,sonnet form[24] although the Southerner did not seem capable of writing
1734,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"a true sonnet, the rhythm moves with ease and harmony. The verses may"
1735,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"infringe every rule of the sonnet form, but the result is effective."
1736,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,
1737,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,Such is the achievement of the Southern war verse. It is a wonderfully
1738,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"effective expression of sentiment, and becomes all the more remarkable"
1739,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,when one considers the conditions under which it was created. It was
1740,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"written in a land first rich and prosperous, then through four weary"
1741,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,years ravaged and starved into ruin: by soldiers in the field and in
1742,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the prisons, and women suffering silently at home. Even the mediums"
1743,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"through which this poetry was published, shared the vicissitudes of the"
1744,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"land, and have been generally destroyed or scattered. Nevertheless the"
1745,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"war poetry of the Confederacy which remains to us today, stands as an"
1746,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,enduring memorial to the inherent nobility of the Southern heart and to
1747,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the fidelity of devotion to principle, which has always given the South"
1748,THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY,"the admiration of those who, while they cannot agree with her point of"
