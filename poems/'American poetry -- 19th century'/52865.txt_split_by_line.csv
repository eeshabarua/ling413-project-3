1911,ETHEL.,"With toiling up life’s path from day to day,"
1912,ETHEL.,The Master sent an angel from His home
1913,ETHEL.,To show our baby girl the nearer way.

3200,THE BABY.,Within his little crib the baby lies;
3201,THE BABY.,And ’neath the lashes of his closing eyes

3203,THE BABY.,
3204,THE BABY.,"His tiny head, upon its pillow white,"

3207,THE BABY.,
3208,THE BABY.,"His cheek, soon flushed in a refreshing sleep,"
3209,THE BABY.,"Is like the petal of a wild-rose deep,"
3210,THE BABY.,While in and out the pretty dimples peep.
3211,THE BABY.,
3212,THE BABY.,"His rose-bud mouth, in such an hour as this,"
3213,THE BABY.,"Invites the pleasure of a loving kiss,"

3215,THE BABY.,
3216,THE BABY.,His tiny teeth are like the precious pearls

3220,THE BABY.,"His shapely ears, like sea-shells pink and small,"
3221,THE BABY.,"Which soon discern the mother song and call,"
3222,THE BABY.,Can quickly hear the slightest sound of all.
3223,THE BABY.,
3224,THE BABY.,"His little nose, not yet in proper style,"
3225,THE BABY.,"Which mother models every little while,"
3226,THE BABY.,Is quite enough to make a critic smile.
3227,THE BABY.,
3228,THE BABY.,"His dimpled hands, unlike the restless feet"
3229,THE BABY.,"Securely pinned within his blanket neat,"
3230,THE BABY.,Oft find a place outside the snowy sheet.
3231,THE BABY.,
3232,THE BABY.,When baby sleeps the house is hushed and lone;
3233,THE BABY.,"His rubber playthings to the floor are thrown,"

3235,THE BABY.,
3236,THE BABY.,When baby wakes the house is filled with joy;

3300,EASTER.,
3301,EASTER.,
3302,EASTER.,’Twas Easter evening and the church
3303,EASTER.,"Was filled with a waiting throng,"
3304,EASTER.,To listen to Easter Service
3305,EASTER.,"With its flowers, its light and song."
3306,EASTER.,
3307,EASTER.,"The organist, by the altar,"
3308,EASTER.,Touched the pretty ivory keys
3309,EASTER.,"And sent, thro’ the house of worship"
3310,EASTER.,The sweetest of melodies.
3311,EASTER.,
3312,EASTER.,"Just as the notes were ceasing,"
3313,EASTER.,"And the people arose for prayer,"
3314,EASTER.,A little maid came softly in
3315,EASTER.,And seated herself by the stair.
3316,EASTER.,
3317,EASTER.,"The service was just beginning,"
3318,EASTER.,She had never entered before;
3319,EASTER.,But while passing had heard the music
3320,EASTER.,And seen bright lights from the door;—
3321,EASTER.,
3322,EASTER.,"So she thought: “I’ll look in a moment,"
3323,EASTER.,"To see what it all is about,—"
3324,EASTER.,And perhaps—if I steal in softly
3325,EASTER.,That no one will find it out.”
3326,EASTER.,
3327,EASTER.,She saw all the people standing
3328,EASTER.,"With heads bowed down in the light,"
3329,EASTER.,"And she heard the words: “Our Father,"
3330,EASTER.,Bless this service here to-night.”
3331,EASTER.,
3332,EASTER.,When the good man ceased his speaking
3333,EASTER.,"And each one had taken seat,"
3334,EASTER.,Again the notes from the organ
3335,EASTER.,Thro’ the stillness sounded sweet.
3336,EASTER.,
3337,EASTER.,"A little girl came to the altar,—"
3338,EASTER.,“No older than I am”—she thought;
3339,EASTER.,"She was dressed in snowy whiteness,"
3340,EASTER.,In her hands sweet flowers she brought.
3341,EASTER.,
3342,EASTER.,"She spoke of the Christ—our Saviour,"
3343,EASTER.,In her pretty childish way;
3344,EASTER.,She said: “The Lord is risen
3345,EASTER.,And he walks with men to-day.”
3346,EASTER.,
3347,EASTER.,"“He loves us—He died to save us,”"
3348,EASTER.,Said the little maid in white—
3349,EASTER.,"“He went to the Home above us,"
3350,EASTER.,To Heaven where there is no night.”
3351,EASTER.,
3352,EASTER.,And the little girl by the stair-way
3353,EASTER.,"In her tattered gown of red,"
3354,EASTER.,"Listening, heard the story sweet"
3355,EASTER.,And treasured the words she said;
3356,EASTER.,
3357,EASTER.,"And she wondered, as she listened,"
3358,EASTER.,If the Saviour did truly care
3359,EASTER.,For one so small and neglected
3360,EASTER.,"As she, sitting down by the stair."
3361,EASTER.,
3362,EASTER.,And while she looked at the flowers
3363,EASTER.,"And heard the grand organ play,"
3364,EASTER.,And sweet voices of the children
3365,EASTER.,Now telling of Easter day;
3366,EASTER.,
3367,EASTER.,"Her little heart grew lighter,"
3368,EASTER.,She said: “I’m alone no more
3369,EASTER.,"For Christ, who loves the children,"
3370,EASTER.,Is my Father now gone before.”
3371,EASTER.,
3372,EASTER.,When the Easter Service was ended
3373,EASTER.,She wended her way alone
3374,EASTER.,Thro’ the streets of the great city
3375,EASTER.,"To the garret, her only home."
3376,EASTER.,
3377,EASTER.,"As she climbed the narrow stair-way,"
3378,EASTER.,"Unlighted by cheering ray,"
3379,EASTER.,Her little heart kept singing
3380,EASTER.,The songs of glad Easter day;
3381,EASTER.,
3382,EASTER.,"And the woman, who kept the lodging,"
3383,EASTER.,Heard the little maiden come
3384,EASTER.,"And asked, in her gruffest manner,"
3385,EASTER.,What kept her so long from home.
3386,EASTER.,
3387,EASTER.,"“’Twas the Easter Service, madam,"
3388,EASTER.,And the words”—she made reply;
3389,EASTER.,“I’m not an orphan any more
3390,EASTER.,For my Father dwells on high.”
3391,EASTER.,
3392,EASTER.,“See! I’ve brought you an Easter lily
3393,EASTER.,"All snowy, and pure, and white,"
3394,EASTER.,Which a lady dropped in passing
3395,EASTER.,Ere her coach wheeled out of sight.”
3396,EASTER.,
3397,EASTER.,“I almost know you’ll like it
3398,EASTER.,"For ’tis part of the Easter day,"
3399,EASTER.,And the children spoke of the lilies
3400,EASTER.,In the verses they had to say.”
3401,EASTER.,
3402,EASTER.,When all was still in the lodging
3403,EASTER.,"And the rest were sleeping below,"
3404,EASTER.,"Unmindful of Christ, the Saviour,"
3405,EASTER.,Who died for them long ago;
3406,EASTER.,
3407,EASTER.,"Then this loving little maiden,"
3408,EASTER.,"Away from all human sight,"
3409,EASTER.,"Knelt down, in the dingy garret,"
3410,EASTER.,To thank God for Easter night.
