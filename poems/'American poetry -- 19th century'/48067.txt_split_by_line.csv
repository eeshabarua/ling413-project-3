97,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,
98,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"The period to which the scholar of two and eighty years belongs, is"
99,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,seldom that of his youngest readers: it is more likely to be the epoch
100,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"of his own golden youth, when his masters were before his eyes, and"
101,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,his companions were the books and the friends of his heart. Thus the
102,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,aged Landor could not bring his thoughts down from the grand forms of
103,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,Greek and Roman literature to which they were early accustomed; he had
104,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"swerved now and then from that loyalty in middle life, impressed and"
105,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,acted upon as he was by the great political events of the Napoleonic
106,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"era,--but he returned to the epigram and the idyl in the “white winter"
107,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"of his age,” and the voices of the present and of the future appealed"
108,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,to him in vain. In the old Goethe there was something more prophetic
109,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"and august; he came nearer to his contemporaries, and prepared the way"
110,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,for a recognition of his greatness by the generation which saw the
111,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"grave close over him. In this, that strange but loyal disciple of his,"
112,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"the Scotch Carlyle, rendered matchless service to his master; yet he,"
113,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"too, in his unhappy old age, could only at intervals, and by gleams"
114,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"of inspiration,--as at the Edinburgh University Festival,--come into"
115,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"communication with the young spirits about him. To you, dear Friend"
116,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"and Master, belongs the rare good fortune (good genius rather) that"
117,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"has brought you in these late days, into closer fellowship than of"
118,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,yore with the active and forthlooking spirit of the time. In youth and
119,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"middle life you were in advance of your period, which has only now"
120,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"overtaken you when it must, by the ordinance of Nature, so soon bid"
121,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"you farewell, as you go forward to new prospects, in fairer worlds"
122,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,than ours.
123,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,
124,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"It is this union of youth and age, of the past and the present--yes,"
125,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"and the future also--that I have admired in these artless poems, over"
126,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,which we have spent together so many agreeable hours. Fallen upon an
127,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"age in literature when the poetic form is everywhere found, but the"
128,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"discerning and inventive spirit of Poesy seems almost lost, I have"
129,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"marked with delight in these octogenarian verses, flowing so naturally"
130,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"from your pen, the very contradiction of this poetic custom of the"
131,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,period. Your want of familiarity with the accustomed movement of verse
132,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"in our time, brings into more distinct notice the genuine poetical"
133,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"motions of your genius. Having been admitted to the laboratory, and"
134,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"privileged to witness the action and reaction of your thought, as it"
135,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"crystallized into song, I perceived, for the first time, how high"
136,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"sentiment, by which you have from youth been inspired, may become the"
137,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"habitual movement of the mind, at an age when so many, if they live at"
138,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"all in spirit, are but nursing the selfish and distorted fancies of"
139,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,morose singularity. To you the world has been a brotherhood of noble
140,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"souls,--too few, as we thought, for your companionship,--but which you"
141,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"have enlarged by the admission to one rank of those who have gone,"
142,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,and of us who remain to love you and listen to your oracles. The men
143,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,and the charming women who recognized your voice when it was that of
144,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"one crying in the wilderness--“Prepare ye the way of our Lord,” are"
145,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"joined, in your commemorative sonnets, with those who hearken to its"
146,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"later accents, proclaiming the same acceptable year of the Lord."
147,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,
148,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,It is the privilege of poets--immemorial and native to the clan--that
149,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,they should share the immortality they confer. This right you may
150,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"vindicate for your own. The honors you pay, in resounding verse, to"
151,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"Channing, to Emerson, to Margaret Fuller, to Hawthorne, Thoreau,"
152,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"and the rest of the company with whom you trod these groves, and"
153,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"honored these altars of the Spirit unnamed, return in their echoes to"
154,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"yourself. They had their special genius, and you yours no less, though"
155,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,it found not the same expression with theirs. We please our love
156,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"with the thought that, in these sonnets and canzonets of affection,"
157,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"you have celebrated yourself with them; that the swift insight, the"
158,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"ennobling passion for truth and virtue, the high resolve, the austere"
159,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"self-sacrifice, the gentle submission to a will eternally right, in"
160,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"which these friends, so variously gifted, found a common tie,--all"
161,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"these are yours also,--and may they be ours! The monuments and"
162,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"trophies of genius are perishable, but the soul’s impression abides"
163,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"forever, _forma mentis æterna_. To that imperishable, ever-beauteous,"
164,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"self-renouncing, loyal, and steadfast Spirit of the Universe which"
165,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"we learned to worship in our youth, and which has never forsaken our"
166,UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.,"age and bereavement, may these offerings, and all that we are, be"

186,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
187,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
188,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“Scorn not the sonnet,” said Wordsworth, and then gave us at least"
189,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"fifty noble reasons why we should not,--for so many at least of his"
190,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"innumerable sonnets are above languor and indifference, and all of"
191,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"them above contempt. Milton was more self-restrained than Wordsworth,"
192,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"and wrote fewer sonnets, every one of which is a treasure, either for"
193,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"beauty of verse, nobility of thought, happy portraiture of persons,"
194,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"or quaint and savage humor,--like that on “Tetrachordon,” and the"
195,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"elongated sonnet in which he denounces the Presbyterians, and tells"
196,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"them to their face, “New Presbyter is but old Priest writ large.”"
197,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Shakespeare unlocked his heart with sonnets in another key than
198,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Milton’s,--less conformed to the model of the Italian sonnet, but more"
199,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"in keeping with English verse, of which Shakespeare had the entire"
200,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"range. His sonnets are but quatrains following each other by threes,"
201,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"with a resounding couplet binding them together in one sheaf, and"
202,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,his example has made this form of the sonnet legitimate for all who
203,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"write English verse,--no matter what the studious or the pedantic may"
204,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"say. Surrey also, who first used the sonnet in English, wrote it in"
205,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"this free manner of Shakespeare, as well as in the somewhat stricter"
206,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"form that Sidney employed, and it is only of late years that they"
207,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,have tried to shut us up to one definite and unchanging sequence and
208,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"interplay of rhyme. Mr. Alcott in these new sonnets, the ripe fruit of"
209,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"an aged tree, has used the freedom that nature gave him, and years"
210,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,allow: he has written with little uniformity in the order and number
211,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"of his rhymes, but with much regard to the spirit of the sonnet as a"
212,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,high form of verse. I fancy that Dante (who may be called the father
213,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"of the sonnet, though not the first to write it) chose this graceful"
214,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"and courteous verse, because it is so well suited to themes of love"
215,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"and friendship. When he would express sorrow or anger, or light and"
216,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"jesting humor, he had recourse to the canzonet, the _terza rima_, or"
217,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"what he called the ballad,--something quite unlike what we know by"
218,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,that name. Mr. Alcott has followed in the same general course; his
219,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"sonnets are one thing, his canzonets another: though the difference"
220,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"in feeling, which prompts him to use one form rather than the other,"
221,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"cannot always be definitely expressed. It is felt rather than seen,"
222,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,and seen rather by the effect of the finished poem than by the light
223,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,of any rule or formal definition.
224,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
225,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Definiteness, in fact, must not be looked for in these poems; nor"
226,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,is it the characteristic of the highest poetry in any language.
227,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Verse may be powerful and suggestive, or even clear in the sense of"
228,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"producing a distinct impression on the mind, without being definite,"
229,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,and responding to all the claims of analysis. I take it that few
230,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"readers will fail to see the central thought, or the vivid portraiture"
231,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,in each of these sonnets and canzonets; but fewer still will be able
232,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"to explain precisely, even to their own minds, what each suggestive"
233,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,phrase and period includes and excludes in its meaning. For this fine
234,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"vagueness of utterance, the sonnet has always given poets a fair"
235,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"field, and our present author has not gone beyond his due privilege"
236,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"in this respect, though he has availed himself of it more frequently"
237,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,than many would have done. The mottoes and citations accompanying each
238,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,sonnet may help the reader to a meaning that does not at once flash in
239,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,his eyes. But he must not expect to conquer these verses at a single
240,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"reading. The thought of years, the labor of months, has been given to"
241,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,the writing of them; and the reader ought not to complain if he take
242,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,as much time to comprehend them as the author took to write them. They
243,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"are worth the pains of reading many times over, and even of learning"
244,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"them by heart, for which their compendious form well fits them."
245,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
246,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,It may be complained that these sonnets lack variety. This is indeed
247,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"a fault into which sonneteers often fall,--our best collection of"
248,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,American sonnets hitherto--those of Jones Very--being open to this
249,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"censure. It will be found, perhaps, that the sameness of rhyme and"
250,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"thought is often but an appearance,--the delicate shade of meaning"
251,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"being expressed, in a vocabulary of no large extent, by a rare"
252,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"process of combining and collocating words. Certain phrases recur,"
253,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"too, because the thought necessarily recurs,--as when the oratory"
254,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"of Phillips and of Parker, as of others, is characterized by the"
255,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"general term, _eloquence_. In the poverty of our language, there is"
256,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"no other term to use, while the qualifying words and their connection"
257,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,sufficiently distinguish between one person and another. The critical
258,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"are referred to Homer, who never fails to repeat the same word, or the"
259,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"same verse, when it comes in his way to do so."
260,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
261,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"But to return to the sonnet itself. Landor, to whom as to Thoreau,"
262,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Milton was the greatest English poet, thought that the blind Puritan"
263,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"had made good his offence against the Psalms of David, by the"
264,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"sonnet on the slaughtered saints of Piedmont. “Milton,” he says,"
265,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,“was never half so wicked a regicide as when he lifted up his hand
266,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"and smote King David. He has atoned for it, however, by composing"
267,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"a magnificent psalm of his own, in the form of a sonnet. There are"
268,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"others in Milton comparable to it, but none elsewhere.” And then the"
269,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"wilful critic goes on to say, putting his words into the mouth of"
270,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Porson: “In the poems of Shakespeare, which are printed as sonnets,"
271,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"there is sometimes a singular strength and intensity of thought,"
272,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,with little of that imagination which was afterward to raise him
273,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,highest in the universe of poetry. Even the interest we take in the
274,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"private life of this miraculous man, cannot keep the volume in our"
275,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"hands long together. We acknowledge great power, but we experience"
276,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"great weariness. Were I a poet, I would much rather have written the"
277,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"‘Allegro,’ or the ‘Penseroso’ than all those.” Monstrous as this"
278,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"comment seems to us, there is a certain truth in it, the sonnet in"
279,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"large quantities always producing weariness; for which reason, as I"
280,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"suppose, Dante interspersed his love sonnets in the “Vita Nuova” and"
281,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"the “Convito,” with canzonets and ballads. His commentaries--often"
282,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"of a singular eloquence--also serve as a relief to the formal verse,"
283,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,as his melodious Tuscan lines do to the formality of his poetical
284,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"metaphysics. A person, says Landor, “lately tried to persuade me that"
285,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"he is never so highly poetical, as when he is deeply metaphysical. He"
286,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"then quoted fourteen German poets of the first order, and expressed"
287,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,his compassion for Æschylus and Homer.” Dante’s metaphysics were of a
288,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"higher cast, and so interfused with love and fair ladies, that they"
289,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,only weary us with a certain perplexity as to where are the limits of
290,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,courtship and of logic. Mr. Alcott also is quaintly metaphysical in
291,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Dante’s fashion; like the sad old Florentine, but with a more cheerful"
292,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"spirit, he addresses himself"
293,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
294,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“To every captive soul and gentle heart,”"
295,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"(A ciascun alma presa e gentil core,)"
296,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
297,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,and would fain inquire of those who go on a pilgrimage of Love (O voi
298,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,che per la via d’Amor passate) and of the fair ladies who have learned
299,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,love at first hand (Donne che avete intelletto d’amore.) His doctrine
300,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,is that of the wise man whom Dante quotes and approves in the “Vita
301,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Nuova,”--"
302,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
303,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,“One and the same are love and the gentle heart.”
304,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,(Amor e’ l cor gentil sono una cosa.)
305,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
306,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Other Americans have written sonnets in this ancient faith,--as he,"
307,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"who thus (in that happy season so aptly described by Mr. Alcott, as"
308,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
309,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,“Youth’s glad morning when the rising East
310,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Glows golden with assurance of success,"
311,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"And life itself’s a rare continual feast,"
312,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Enjoyed the more if meditated less,”)"
313,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
314,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,addressed his own _cor gentil_:--
315,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
316,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“My heart, forthlooking in the purple day,"
317,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Tell me what sweetest image thou may’st see,"
318,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Fit to be type of thy dear love and thee?
319,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Lo! here where sunshine keeps the wind away,"
320,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Grow two young violets,--humble lovers they,--"
321,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"With drooping face to face, and breath to breath,"
322,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,They look and kiss and love and laugh at death:--
323,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Yon bluebird singing on the scarlet spray
324,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Of the bloomed maple in the blithe spring air,"
325,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"While his mate answers from the wood of pines,"
326,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And all day long their music ne’er declines;
327,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"For love their labor is, and love their care."
328,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"‘These pass with day and spring;’ the true heart saith,--"
329,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"‘Forever thou wilt love, and she be fair.’”"
330,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
331,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"In the same Italian vein, another and better poet, but with less"
332,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"warmth, touches the same theme,--"
333,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
334,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“Thou art like that which is most sweet and fair,"
335,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"A gentle morning in the youth of spring,"
336,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,When the few early birds begin to sing
337,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Within the delicate depths of the fine air.
338,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Yet shouldst thou these dear beauties much impair,"
339,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Since thou art better than is everything
340,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Which or the woods or skies or green fields bring,"
341,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And finer thoughts hast thou than they can wear.
342,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,In the proud sweetness of thy grace I see
343,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"What lies within,--a pure and steadfast mind,"
344,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Which its own mistress is of sanctity,"
345,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And to all gentleness hath been refined.
346,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,So that thy least breath falleth upon me
347,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,As the soft breathing of midsummer wind.”
348,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
349,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"In the changes of time and the fitful mood of the poet, sadness"
350,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"succeeds to this assured joy, and he sings,--"
351,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
352,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“The day has past, I never may return;"
353,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Twelve circling years have run since first I came
354,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And kindled the pure truth of friendship’s flame;
355,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Alone remain these ashes in the urn--
356,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Vainly for light the taper may I turn,--"
357,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Thy hand is closed, as for these years, the same,"
358,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And for the substance naught is but the name.
359,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"No more a hope, no more a ray to burn."
360,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"But once more in the pauses of thy joy,"
361,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Remember him who sought thee in his youth,"
362,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And with the old reliance of the boy
363,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Asked for thy treasures in the guise of truth.”
364,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
365,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Here is another voice, chanting in another strain,--"
366,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
367,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“Thy beauty fades, and with it, too, my love,"
368,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,For ’twas the selfsame stalk that bore the flower;
369,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Soft fell the rain, and, breaking from above,"
370,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,The sun looked out upon our nuptial hour;
371,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And I had thought forever by thy side
372,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,With bursting buds of hope in youth to dwell;
373,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"But one by one Time strewed thy petals wide,"
374,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And every hope’s wan look a grief can tell;
375,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"For I had thoughtless lived beneath his sway,"
376,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Who like a tyrant dealeth with us all,--"
377,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Crowning each rose, though rooted in decay,"
378,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"With charms that shall the spirit’s love enthral,"
379,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"And, for a season, turn the soul’s pure eyes"
380,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,From virtue’s bloom that time and death defies.”
381,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
382,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Out of this valley of sadness the spirit rises on bolder wing, as the"
383,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"melancholy mood passes away,--"
384,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
385,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“Hearts of eternity, hearts of the deep!"
386,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Proclaim from land to sea your mighty fate;
387,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"How that for you no living comes too late,"
388,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"How ye cannot in Theban labyrinth creep,"
389,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"How ye great harvests from small surface reap,"
390,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Shout, excellent band, in grand primeval strain,"
391,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Like midnight winds that foam along the main,--"
392,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And do all things rather than pause to weep.
393,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"A human heart knows naught of littleness,"
394,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Suspects no man, compares with no one’s ways,"
395,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Hath in one hour most glorious length of days,"
396,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"A recompense, a joy, a loveliness;"
397,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Like eaglet keen, shoots into azure far,"
398,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And always dwelling nigh is the remotest star.”
399,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
400,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Here, as Landor said, “is a sonnet, and the sonnet admits not that"
401,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,approach to the prosaic which is allowable in the ballad.” For this
402,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"reason Mr. Alcott, who began his poetical autobiography, when he was"
403,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"eighty years old, in a ballad measure, has now passed into the majesty"
404,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"of the sonnet, as he has come to those passages of life which will not"
405,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"admit prosaic treatment. Moderately used, and not worked to death,"
406,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"as Wordsworth employed it, the sonnet is a great uplifter of poesy."
407,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"It calls to the reader, as the early Christian litanies did to the"
408,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"worshipper, _Sursum corda_, Raise your thoughts! The canzonet lets us"
409,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"down again into the pathetic, the humorous, or the fanciful,--though"
410,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,in this volume the canzonet generally betokens sadness. It may easily
411,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"become an ode, as in the verses on Garfield: indeed the ode may be"
412,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"considered as an extended canzonet, or the canzonet as a brief ode."
413,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"It is the sonnet that chiefly concerns us now, and that form of the"
414,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,sonnet which deals with love; since the germ of this book was a
415,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"romance of love, seeking to express itself in the uplifting strain"
416,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,and tender cadence of successive sonnets; which lead us though green
417,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"pastures and beside the still waters, and then to the shore of the"
418,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"resounding sea,--itself worthy of a sonnet which I have somewhere"
419,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,heard:--
420,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
421,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,“Ah mournful Sea! Yet to our eyes he wore
422,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,The placid look of some great god at rest;
423,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"With azure arms he clasped the embracing shore,"
424,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,While gently heaved the billows of his breast;
425,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"We scarce his voice could hear, and then it seemed"
426,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"The happy murmur of a lover true,"
427,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Who, in the sweetness of his sleep, hath dreamed"
428,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Of kisses falling on his lips like dew.
429,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Far off, the blue and gleaming hills above,"
430,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"The Sun looked through his veil of thinnest haze,"
431,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"As coy Diana, blushing at her love,"
432,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Half hid with her own light her earnest gaze,"
433,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,When on the shady Latmian slope she found
434,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Fair-haired Endymion slumbering on the ground.”
435,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
436,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"This is one picture in the kaleidoscope of Aphrodite, who was a"
437,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"sea-born goddess, and partial to her native element. Yet it is not"
438,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"through the eye alone that she ensnares us, but with the music of"
439,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"birds,--and in poetry her own darling bird is not the dove, but the"
440,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"nightingale,--a stranger to our orchards and forests, but familiar to"
441,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"the groves of the Muse. A poet, by no means happy in his love in after"
442,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"years, thus saluted this bird, with music as sweet as her own,--"
443,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
444,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy spray,"
445,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Warblest at eve, when all the woods are still,"
446,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Thou with fresh hope the lover’s heart doth fill,"
447,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,While the jolly Hours lead on propitious May.
448,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Thy liquid notes, that close the eye of day,"
449,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"First heard before the shallow cuckoo’s bill,"
450,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Portend success in love; O, if Jove’s will"
451,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Have linked that amorous power to thy soft lay,"
452,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Now timely sing, ere the rude bird of hate"
453,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Foretell my hopeless doom in some grove nigh;
454,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,As thou from year to year hast sung too late
455,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"For my relief, yet hadst no reason why;"
456,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Whether the Muse, or Love call thee his mate,"
457,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Both them I serve, and of their train am I.”"
458,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
459,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"This is plainly a fabricated song, not poured out from the heart,"
460,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,though full of melodious fancy. More natural and earnest is the tone
461,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,in which our poet soon after praises one who had passed unheeding by
462,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"the bower of love, and devoted herself to a life of piety and good"
463,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"deeds. We cannot guess who she was, but such saints are seen in every"
464,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,land and age.
465,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
466,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“Lady, that in the prime of earliest youth"
467,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Wisely hast shunned the broad way and the green,"
468,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And with those few art eminently seen
469,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"That labor up the hill of heavenly truth,--"
470,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"The better part with Mary and with Ruth,"
471,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Chosen thou hast; and they that overween,"
472,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"And at thy growing virtues fret their spleen,"
473,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"No anger find in thee, but pity and ruth."
474,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Thy care is fixed, and zealously attends"
475,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"To fill thy odorous lamp with deeds of light,"
476,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And hope that reaps not shame. Therefore be sure
477,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Thou, when the bridegroom with his feastful friends"
478,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Passes to bliss at the mid hour of night,"
479,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Hast gained thy entrance, virginwise and pure.”"
480,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
481,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"It is a truth for the initiated that love begins with worship, and"
482,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,favors piety in its first approaches; and we need not wonder if the
483,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,devout poet in due time paid his amorous addresses to this bride of
484,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"the Spirit, whose lamp must have been dim, indeed, if it did not"
485,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,reveal to her the lover in disguise of the brother in Israel. A poet
486,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"of our day, in a sonnet somewhat faulty in form, but true to the faith"
487,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"of your pilgrim-vow, ye happy palmers of Love,--"
488,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
489,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,“O voi che per la via d’Amor passate!”
490,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
491,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,has written as follows:--
492,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
493,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“‘As calmest waters mirror Heaven the best,"
494,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,So best befit remembrances of thee
495,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Calm holy hours from earthly passion free,"
496,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Sweet twilight musing,--Sabbaths in the breast."
497,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"No stooping thought, nor any grovelling care,"
498,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"The sacred whiteness of that place shall stain,"
499,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Where, far from heartless joys and rites profane,"
500,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Memory has reared to thee an altar fair.
501,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Yet frequent visitors shall kiss the shrine,"
502,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And ever keep its vestal lamp alight;
503,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"All noble thoughts, all dreams divinely bright,"
504,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,That waken or delight this soul of mine.’
505,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"So Love, meek pilgrim! his young vows did pay,"
506,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,With glowing eyes that must his lips gainsay.”
507,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
508,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"A higher gospel is preached in the sonnet of another American poet,"
509,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"who has written too few verses,--or rather has published too few of"
510,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,the many he has composed.
511,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
512,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“As unto blooming roses, summer dews,"
513,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Or morning’s amber to the tree-top choirs,"
514,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,So to my bosom are the beams that use
515,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,To rain on me from eyes that Love inspires;
516,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Your love,--vouchsafe it, royal-hearted Few,--"
517,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And I will set no common price thereon;
518,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"O, I will keep, as Heaven his holy blue,"
519,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Or Night her diamonds, that dear treasure won."
520,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"But aught of inward faith must I forego,"
521,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Or miss one drop from Truth’s baptismal hand,"
522,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Think poorer thoughts, pray cheaper prayers, and grow"

526,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
527,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"A poet who has been more than once quoted in this essay, saw no sharp"

530,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
531,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“O Death! thou art the palace of our hopes,"
532,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"The storehouse of our joys,--great labor’s end.”"
533,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
534,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"His friend, confronting the same inevitable guest, questioned the"

537,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,
538,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"“What strange deep secret dost thou hold, O Death!"
539,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,To hallow those thou claimest for thine own?
540,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"That which the open book could never teach,"
541,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"The closed one whispers, as we stand alone"
542,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"By one, how more alone than we!--and strive"

544,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"In vain our thoughts would wind within the heart,"

546,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,Baptism of Death--which steepest infant eyes
547,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"In grace of calm that saints might hope to wear,"
548,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,"Whose cold touch purifies the guilty brow,"
549,THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.,And sets again the seal of childhood there--
