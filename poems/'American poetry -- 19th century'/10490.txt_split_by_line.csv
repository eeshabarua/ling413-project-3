701,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Filling the summer air;
702,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And within the woodlands as he trod,"
703,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The twilight was like the Truce of God
704,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,With worldly woe and care;
705,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Under him lay the golden moss;
706,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And above him the boughs of hemlock-tree
707,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Waved, and made the sign of the cross,"
708,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And whispered their Benedicites;
709,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And from the ground
710,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Rose an odor sweet and fragrant
711,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Of the wild flowers and the vagrant
712,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Vines that wandered,"
713,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Seeking the sunshine, round and round."
714,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"These he heeded not, but pondered"
715,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"On the volume in his hand,"
716,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,A volume of Saint Augustine;
717,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Wherein he read of the unseen
718,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Splendors of God's great town
719,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"In the unknown land,"
720,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And, with his eyes cast down"
721,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"In humility, he said:"
722,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""I believe, O God,"
723,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"What herein I have read,"
724,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"But alas! I do not understand!"""
725,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
726,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And lo! he heard
727,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"The sudden singing of a bird,"
728,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"A snow-white bird, that from a cloud"
729,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Dropped down,"
730,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And among the branches brown
731,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Sat singing
732,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"So sweet, and clear, and loud,"
733,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,It seemed a thousand harp strings ringing.
734,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And the Monk Felix closed his book,"
735,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And long, long,"
736,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"With rapturous look,"
737,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"He listened to the song,"
738,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And hardly breathed or stirred,"
739,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Until he saw, as in a vision,"
740,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"The land Elysian,"
741,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And in the heavenly city heard
742,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Angelic feet
743,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Fall on the golden flagging of the street.
744,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And he would fain
745,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Have caught the wondrous bird,"
746,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,But strove in vain;
747,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"For it flew away, away,"
748,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Far over hill and dell,"
749,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And instead of its sweet singing
750,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,He heard the convent bell
751,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Suddenly in the silence ringing
752,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,For the service of noonday.
753,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And he retraced
754,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,His pathway homeward sadly and in haste.
755,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
756,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,In the convent there was a change!
757,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"He looked for each well known face,"
758,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,But the faces were new and strange;
759,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"New figures sat in the oaken stalls,"
760,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"New voices chaunted in the choir,"
761,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Yet the place was the same place,"
762,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The same dusky walls
763,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of cold, gray stone,"
764,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The same cloisters and belfry and spire.
765,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
766,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,A stranger and alone
767,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Among that brotherhood
768,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The Monk Felix stood
769,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""Forty years,"" said a Friar."
770,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""Have I been Prior"
771,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of this convent in the wood,"
772,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,But for that space
773,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Never have I beheld thy face!"""
774,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
775,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The heart of the Monk Felix fell:
776,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And he answered with submissive tone,"
777,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""This morning, after the hour of Prime,"
778,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"I left my cell,"
779,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And wandered forth alone,"
780,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Listening all the time
781,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,To the melodious singing
782,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of a beautiful white bird,"
783,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Until I heard
784,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The bells of the convent ringing
785,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Noon from their noisy towers,"
786,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,It was as if I dreamed;
787,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,For what to me had seemed
788,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Moments only, had been hours!"""
789,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
790,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""Years!"" said a voice close by."
791,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"It was an aged monk who spoke,"
792,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,From a bench of oak
793,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Fastened against the wall;--
794,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,He was the oldest monk of all.
795,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,For a whole century
796,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Had he been there,"
797,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Serving God in prayer,"
798,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The meekest and humblest of his creatures.
799,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,He remembered well the features
800,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of Felix, and he said,"
801,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Speaking distinct and slow:
802,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""One hundred years ago,"
803,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"When I was a novice in this place,"
804,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"There was here a monk, full of God's grace,"
805,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Who bore the name
806,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of Felix, and this man must be the same."""
807,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
808,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And straightway
809,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,They brought forth to the light of day
810,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"A volume old and brown,"
811,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"A huge tome, bound"
812,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"With brass and wild-boar's hide,"
813,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Therein were written down
814,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The names of all who had died
815,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"In the convent, since it was edified."
816,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And there they found,"
817,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Just as the old monk said,"
818,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"That on a certain day and date,"
819,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"One hundred years before,"
820,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Had gone forth from the convent gate
821,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"The Monk Felix, and never more"
822,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Had entered that sacred door.
823,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,He had been counted among the dead!
824,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And they knew, at last,"
825,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"That, such had been the power"
826,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of that celestial and immortal song,"
827,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"A hundred years had passed,"
828,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And had not seemed so long
829,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,As a single hour!
830,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
831,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,(ELSIE _comes in with flowers._)
832,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
833,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"_Elsie._ Here are flowers for you,"
834,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,But they are not all for you.
835,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Some of them are for the Virgin
836,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And for Saint Cecilia.
837,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
838,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"_Prince Henry._ As thou standest there,"
839,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Thou seemest to me like the angel
840,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,That brought the immortal roses
841,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,To Saint Cecilia's bridal chamber.
842,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
843,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,_Elsie._ But these will fade.
844,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
845,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"_Prince Henry._ Themselves will fade,"
846,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"But not their memory,"
847,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And memory has the power
848,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,To re-create them from the dust.
849,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"They remind me, too,"
850,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of martyred Dorothea,"
851,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Who from celestial gardens sent
852,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Flowers as her witnesses
853,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,To him who scoffed and doubted.
854,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
855,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,_Elsie._ Do you know the story
856,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Of Christ and the Sultan's daughter?
857,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,That is the prettiest legend of them all.
858,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
859,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,_Prince Henry._ Then tell it to me.
860,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,But first come hither.
861,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Lay the flowers down beside me.
862,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And put both thy hands in mine.
863,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Now tell me the story.
864,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
865,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,_Elsie._ Early in the morning
866,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The Sultan's daughter
867,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Walked in her father's garden,"
868,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Gathering the bright flowers,"
869,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,All full of dew.
870,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
871,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,_Prince Henry._ Just as thou hast been doing
872,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"This morning, dearest Elsie."
873,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
874,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"_Elsie._ And as she gathered them,"
875,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,She wondered more and more
876,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Who was the Master of the Flowers,"
877,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And made them grow
878,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Out of the cold, dark earth."
879,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""In my heart,"" she said,"
880,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""I love him; and for him"
881,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Would leave my father's palace,"
882,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"To labor in his garden."""
883,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
884,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"_Prince Henry._ Dear, innocent child!"
885,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,How sweetly thou recallest
886,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"The long-forgotten legend,"
887,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,That in my early childhood
888,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,My mother told me!
889,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Upon my brain
890,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"It reappears once more,"
891,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,As a birth-mark on the forehead
892,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,When a hand suddenly
893,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Is laid upon it, and removed!"
894,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
895,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"_Elsie._ And at midnight,"
896,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"As she lay upon her bed,"
897,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,She heard a voice
898,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Call to her from the garden,"
899,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And, looking forth from her window,"
900,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,She saw a beautiful youth
901,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Standing among the flowers.
902,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,It was the Lord Jesus;
903,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And she went down to him,"
904,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And opened the door for him;
905,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And he said to her, ""O maiden!"
906,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Thou hast thought of me with love,"
907,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And for thy sake
908,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Out of my Father's kingdom
909,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Have I come hither:
910,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,I am the Master of the Flowers.
911,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"My garden is in Paradise,"
912,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And if thou wilt go with me,"
913,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Thy bridal garland
914,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Shall be of bright red flowers."""
915,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And then he took from his finger
916,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"A golden ring,"
917,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And asked the Sultan's daughter
918,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,If she would be his bride.
919,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And when she answered him with love,"
920,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"His wounds began to bleed,"
921,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And she said to him,"
922,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""O Love! how red thy heart is,"
923,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And thy hands are full of roses,"""
924,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""For thy sake,"" answered he,"
925,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""For thy sake is my heart so red,"
926,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,For thee I bring these roses.
927,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,I gathered them at the cross
928,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Whereon I died for thee!
929,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Come, for my Father calls."
930,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Thou art my elected bride!"""
931,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And the Sultan's daughter
932,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Followed him to his Father's garden.
933,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
934,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"_Prince Henry._ Wouldst thou have done so, Elsie?"
935,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
936,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"_Elsie._ Yes, very gladly."
937,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
938,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,_Prince Henry._ Then the Celestial Bridegroom
939,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Will come for thee also.
940,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Upon thy forehead he will place,"
941,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Not his crown of thorns,"
942,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,But a crown of roses.
943,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"In thy bridal chamber,"
944,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Like Saint Cecilia,"
945,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Thou shall hear sweet music,"
946,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And breathe the fragrance
947,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Of flowers immortal!
948,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Go now and place these flowers
949,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Before her picture.

1527,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,I cannot repeat a thousandth part

1529,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"That arise, when with palpitating throes"
1530,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,The graveyard in the human heart
1531,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Gives up its dead, at the voice of the priest,"
1532,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"As if he were an archangel, at least."
1533,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"It makes a peculiar atmosphere,"
1534,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"This odor of earthly passions and crimes,"
1535,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Such as I like to breathe, at times,"
1536,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,And such as often brings me here
1537,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,In the hottest and most pestilential season.
1538,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"To-day, I come for another reason;"
1539,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,To foster and ripen an evil thought
1540,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"In a heart that is almost to madness wrought,"
1541,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"And to make a murderer out of a prince,"
1542,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,A sleight of hand I learned long since!
1543,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,He comes  In the twilight he will not see
1544,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,the difference between his priest and me!
1545,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,In the same net was the mother caught!
1546,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,
1547,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,(_Prince Henry entering and kneeling at the confessional._)

1559,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Meanwhile, hast thou searched well thy breast?"
1560,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Does the same madness fill thy brain?
1561,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Or have thy passion and unrest
1562,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Vanished forever from thy mind?
1563,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,
1564,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"_Prince Henry_. By the same madness still made blind,"
1565,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"By the same passion still possessed,"
1566,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"I come again to the house of prayer,"
1567,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,A man afflicted and distressed!
1568,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"As in a cloudy atmosphere,"

1571,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Strikes the great forest white with fear,"

1574,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"And meadows of grass, and fields of grain,"
1575,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"And the clouds above, and the slanting rain,"
1576,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"And smoke from chimneys of the town,"

1578,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,So does this dreadful purpose press
1579,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Onward, with irresistible stress,"
1580,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"And all my thoughts and faculties,"
1581,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Struck level by the strength of this,"

1588,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"A moment only, then to fall"

1590,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,At the subsiding of the gust!
1591,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,
1592,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,_Prince Henry_. O holy Father! pardon in me
1593,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,The oscillation of a mind
1594,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Unsteadfast, and that cannot find"
1595,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Its centre of rest and harmony!
1596,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,For evermore before mine eyes
1597,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"This ghastly phantom flits and flies,"
1598,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"And as a madman through a crowd,"
1599,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"With frantic gestures and wild cries,"
1600,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"It hurries onward, and aloud"
1601,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Repeats its awful prophecies!
1602,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Weakness is wretchedness! To be strong
1603,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Is to be happy! I am weak,"
1604,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"And cannot find the good I seek,"
1605,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Because I feel and fear the wrong!
1606,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,
1607,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,_Lucifer_. Be not alarmed! The Church is kind--
1608,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,And in her mercy and her meekness
1609,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"She meets half-way her children's weakness,"
1610,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Writes their transgressions in the dust!
1611,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Though in the Decalogue we find
1612,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"The mandate written, ""Thou shalt not kill!"""
1613,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Yet there are cases when we must.
1614,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"In war, for instance, or from scathe"
1615,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,To guard and keep the one true Faith!
1616,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,We must look at the Decalogue in the light
1617,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Of an ancient statute, that was meant"
1618,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"For a mild and general application,"
1619,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"To be understood with the reservation,"
1620,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"That, in certain instances, the Right"
1621,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Must yield to the Expedient!
1622,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Thou art a Prince. If thou shouldst die,"
1623,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,What hearts and hopes would prostrate he!
1624,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"What noble deeds, what fair renown,"
1625,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Into the grave with thee go down!
1626,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,What acts of valor and courtesy
1627,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Remain undone, and die with thee!"
1628,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Thou art the last of all thy race!
1629,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"With thee a noble name expires,"
1630,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,And vanishes from the earth's face
1631,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,The glorious memory of thy sires!
1632,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,She is a peasant. In her veins
1633,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Flows common and plebeian blood;
1634,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,It is such as daily and hourly stains
1635,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"The dust and the turf of battle plains,"
1636,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"By vassals shed, in a crimson flood,"
1637,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Without reserve, and without reward,"
1638,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,At the slightest summons of their lord!
1639,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"But thine is precious, the fore-appointed"
1640,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Blood of kings, of God's anointed!"
1641,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Moreover, what has the world in store"
1642,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"For one like her, but tears and toil?"
1643,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Daughter of sorrow, serf of the soil,"
1644,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"A peasant's child and a peasant's wife,"
1645,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,And her soul within her sick and sore
1646,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,With the roughness and barrenness of life!
1647,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,I marvel not at the heart's recoil
1648,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"From a fate like this, in one so tender,"
1649,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Nor at its eagerness to surrender
1650,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"All the wretchedness, want, and woe"
1651,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"That await it in this world below,"
1652,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,For the unutterable splendor
1653,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Of the world of rest beyond the skies.
1654,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,So the Church sanctions the sacrifice:
1655,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Therefore inhale this healing balm,"
1656,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,And breathe this fresh life into thine;
1657,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Accept the comfort and the calm
1658,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"She offers, as a gift divine,"
1659,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Let her fall down and anoint thy feet
1660,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,With the ointment costly and most sweet
1661,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Of her young blood, and thou shall live."
1662,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,
1663,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,_Prince Henry._ And will the righteous Heaven forgive?
1664,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"No action, whether foul or fair,"
1665,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Is ever done, but it leaves somewhere"
1666,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"A record, written by fingers ghostly,"
1667,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"As a blessing or a curse, and mostly"
1668,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,In the greater weakness or greater strength
1669,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Of the acts which follow it, till at length"
1670,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"The wrongs of ages are redressed,"
1671,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,And the justice of God made manifest!
1672,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,
1673,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,_Lucifer_  In ancient records it is stated
1674,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"That, whenever an evil deed is done,"
1675,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Another devil is created
1676,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,To scourge and torment the offending one!
1677,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"But evil is only good perverted,"
1678,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"And Lucifer, the Bearer of Light,"
1679,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"But an angel fallen and deserted,"
1680,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Thrust from his Father's house with a curse
1681,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Into the black and endless night.
1682,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,
1683,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"_Prince Henry._ If justice rules the universe,"
1684,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,From the good actions of good men
1685,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Angels of light should be begotten,"
1686,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,And thus the balance restored again.
1687,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,
1688,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"_Lucifer._ Yes; if the world were not so rotten,"
1689,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,And so given over to the Devil!
1690,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,
1691,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"_Prince Henry._ But this deed, is it good or evil?"
1692,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,Have I thine absolution free
1693,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"To do it, and without restriction?"
1694,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,
1695,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,_Lucifer._ Ay; and from whatsoever sin
1696,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"Lieth around it and within,"
1697,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,"From all crimes in which it may involve thee,"
1698,A VILLAGE CHURCH.,I now release thee and absolve thee!

2215,CHAUNT.,_Elsie._ How very grand it is and wonderful!
2216,CHAUNT.,Never have I beheld a church so splendid!
2217,CHAUNT.,"Such columns, and such arches, and such windows,"
2218,CHAUNT.,"So many tombs and statues in the chapels,"
2219,CHAUNT.,And under them so many confessionals.
2220,CHAUNT.,They must be for the rich. I should not like

2227,CHAUNT.,"Children that came to see these Saints in stone,"

2231,CHAUNT.,The generation that succeeds our own
2232,CHAUNT.,Perhaps may finish it. The architect
2233,CHAUNT.,"Built his great heart into these sculptured stones,"
2234,CHAUNT.,"And with him toiled his children, and their lives"
2235,CHAUNT.,"Were builded, with his own, into the walls,"

2243,CHAUNT.,
2244,CHAUNT.,"_Prince Henry._ That, too, she sculptured. At the base of it"
2245,CHAUNT.,Stand the Evangelists; above their heads
2246,CHAUNT.,"Four Angels blowing upon marble trumpets,"
2247,CHAUNT.,"And over them the blessed Christ, surrounded"
2248,CHAUNT.,"By his attendant ministers, upholding"
2249,CHAUNT.,The instruments of his passion.
2250,CHAUNT.,
2251,CHAUNT.,_Elsie._ O my Lord!
2252,CHAUNT.,Would I could leave behind me upon earth
2253,CHAUNT.,"Some monument to thy glory, such as this!"
2254,CHAUNT.,
2255,CHAUNT.,_Prince Henry._ A greater monument than this thou leavest
2256,CHAUNT.,"In thine own life, all purity and love!"
2257,CHAUNT.,"See, too, the Rose, above the western portal"
2258,CHAUNT.,"Flamboyant with a thousand gorgeous colors,"
2259,CHAUNT.,The perfect flower of Gothic loveliness!
2260,CHAUNT.,
2261,CHAUNT.,"_Elsie._ And, in the gallery, the long line of statues,"

2922,IV. THE ROAD HIRSCHAU.,a banner when winds are still.
2923,IV. THE ROAD HIRSCHAU.,

2936,IV. THE ROAD HIRSCHAU.,Priests and peasants in long procession come forth

2958,BLACK FOREST.,"With a thoughtful, solemn, and reverent pace,"
2959,BLACK FOREST.,Pausing long enough on each stair
2960,BLACK FOREST.,"To breathe an ejaculatory prayer,"
2961,BLACK FOREST.,And a benediction on the vines
2962,BLACK FOREST.,That produce these various sorts of wines!
2963,BLACK FOREST.,
2964,BLACK FOREST.,"For my part, I am well content"
2965,BLACK FOREST.,That we have got through with the tedious Lent!
2966,BLACK FOREST.,Fasting is all very well for those
2967,BLACK FOREST.,Who have to contend with invisible foes;
2968,BLACK FOREST.,But I am quite sure it does not agree
2969,BLACK FOREST.,"With a quiet, peaceable man like me,"
2970,BLACK FOREST.,Who am not of that nervous and meagre kind
2971,BLACK FOREST.,That are always distressed in body and mind!
2972,BLACK FOREST.,And at times it really does me good
2973,BLACK FOREST.,"To come down among this brotherhood,"
2974,BLACK FOREST.,"Dwelling forever under ground,"
2975,BLACK FOREST.,"Silent, contemplative, round and sound;"
2976,BLACK FOREST.,"Each one old, and brown with mould,"
2977,BLACK FOREST.,"But filled to the lips with the ardor of youth,"
2978,BLACK FOREST.,"With the latent power and love of truth,"
2979,BLACK FOREST.,And with virtues fervent and manifold.
2980,BLACK FOREST.,
2981,BLACK FOREST.,"I have heard it said, that at Easter-tide,"
2982,BLACK FOREST.,"When buds are swelling on every side,"
2983,BLACK FOREST.,And the sap begins to move in the vine.
2984,BLACK FOREST.,"Then in all the cellars, far and wide,"
2985,BLACK FOREST.,"The oldest, as well as the newest, wine"
2986,BLACK FOREST.,"Begins to stir itself, and ferment,"
2987,BLACK FOREST.,With a kind of revolt and discontent
2988,BLACK FOREST.,"At being so long in darkness pent,"
2989,BLACK FOREST.,And fain would burst from its sombre tun
2990,BLACK FOREST.,To bask on the hillside in the sun;
2991,BLACK FOREST.,"As in the bosom of us poor friars,"
2992,BLACK FOREST.,The tumult of half-subdued desires
2993,BLACK FOREST.,For the world that we have left behind
2994,BLACK FOREST.,Disturbs at times all peace of mind!
2995,BLACK FOREST.,"And now that we have lived through Lent,"
2996,BLACK FOREST.,"My duty it is, as often before,"
2997,BLACK FOREST.,"To open awhile the prison-door,"
2998,BLACK FOREST.,And give these restless spirits vent.
2999,BLACK FOREST.,
3000,BLACK FOREST.,"Now here is a cask that stands alone,"
3001,BLACK FOREST.,"And has stood a hundred years or more,"
3002,BLACK FOREST.,"Its beard of cobwebs, long and hoar,"
3003,BLACK FOREST.,"Trailing and sweeping along the floor,"
3004,BLACK FOREST.,"Like Barbarossa, who sits in his cave,"
3005,BLACK FOREST.,"Taciturn, sombre, sedate, and grave,"
3006,BLACK FOREST.,Till his beard has grown through the table of stone!
3007,BLACK FOREST.,It is of the quick and not of the dead!
3008,BLACK FOREST.,"In its veins the blood is hot and red,"
3009,BLACK FOREST.,And a heart still beats in those ribs of oak
3010,BLACK FOREST.,"That time may have tamed, but has not broke;"
3011,BLACK FOREST.,"It comes from Bacharach on the Rhine,"
3012,BLACK FOREST.,"Is one of the three best kinds of wine,"
3013,BLACK FOREST.,And costs some hundred florins the ohm;
3014,BLACK FOREST.,"But that I do not consider dear,"
3015,BLACK FOREST.,When I remember that every year
3016,BLACK FOREST.,Four butts are sent to the Pope of Rome.
3017,BLACK FOREST.,"And whenever a goblet thereof I drain,"
3018,BLACK FOREST.,The old rhyme keeps running in my brain:
3019,BLACK FOREST.,
3020,BLACK FOREST.,"At Bacharach on the Rhine,"
3021,BLACK FOREST.,"At Hochheim on the Main,"
3022,BLACK FOREST.,"And at Würzburg on the Stein,"
3023,BLACK FOREST.,Grow the three best kinds of wine!
3024,BLACK FOREST.,
3025,BLACK FOREST.,"They are all good wines, and better far"
3026,BLACK FOREST.,"Than those of the Neckar, or those of the Ahr"
3027,BLACK FOREST.,"In particular, Würzburg well may boast"
3028,BLACK FOREST.,"Of its blessed wine of the Holy Ghost,"
3029,BLACK FOREST.,Which of all wines I like the most.
3030,BLACK FOREST.,"This I shall draw for the Abbot's drinking,"
3031,BLACK FOREST.,Who seems to be much of my way of thinking.
3032,BLACK FOREST.,
3033,BLACK FOREST.,(_Fills a flagon._)
3034,BLACK FOREST.,
3035,BLACK FOREST.,Ah! how the streamlet laughs and sings!
3036,BLACK FOREST.,What a delicious fragrance springs
3037,BLACK FOREST.,"From the deep flagon, while it fills,"
3038,BLACK FOREST.,As of hyacinths and daffodils!
3039,BLACK FOREST.,Between this cask and the Abbot's lips
3040,BLACK FOREST.,Many have been the sips and slips;
3041,BLACK FOREST.,"Many have been the draughts of wine,"
3042,BLACK FOREST.,"On their way to his, that have stopped at mine;"
3043,BLACK FOREST.,And many a time my soul has hankered
3044,BLACK FOREST.,"For a deep draught out of his silver tankard,"
3045,BLACK FOREST.,"When it should have been busy with other affairs,"
3046,BLACK FOREST.,Less with its longings and more with its prayers.
3047,BLACK FOREST.,"But now there is no such awkward condition,"
3048,BLACK FOREST.,No danger of death and eternal perdition;
3049,BLACK FOREST.,"So here's to the Abbot and Brothers all,"

3054,BLACK FOREST.,O cordial delicious! O soother of pain!
3055,BLACK FOREST.,It flashes like sunshine into my brain!
3056,BLACK FOREST.,A benison rest on the Bishop who sends
3057,BLACK FOREST.,Such a fudder of wine as this to his friends!
3058,BLACK FOREST.,
3059,BLACK FOREST.,And now a flagon for such as may ask
3060,BLACK FOREST.,"A draught from the noble Bacharach cask,"
3061,BLACK FOREST.,"And I will be gone, though I know full well"
3062,BLACK FOREST.,The cellar's a cheerfuller place than the cell.
3063,BLACK FOREST.,"Behold where he stands, all sound and good,"
3064,BLACK FOREST.,Brown and old in his oaken hood;
3065,BLACK FOREST.,Silent he seems externally
3066,BLACK FOREST.,As any Carthusian monk may be;
3067,BLACK FOREST.,"But within, what a spirit of deep unrest!"
3068,BLACK FOREST.,What a seething and simmering in his breast!
3069,BLACK FOREST.,As if the heaving of his great heart
3070,BLACK FOREST.,Would burst his belt of oak apart!
3071,BLACK FOREST.,"Let me unloose this button of wood,"
3072,BLACK FOREST.,And quiet a little his turbulent mood.
3073,BLACK FOREST.,
3074,BLACK FOREST.,(_Sets it running._)
3075,BLACK FOREST.,
3076,BLACK FOREST.,"See! how its currents gleam and shine,"

3078,BLACK FOREST.,"Of autumn sunsets on the Rhine,"
3079,BLACK FOREST.,Descending and mingling with the dews;
3080,BLACK FOREST.,Or as if the grapes were stained with the blood
3081,BLACK FOREST.,"Of the innocent boy, who, some years back,"
3082,BLACK FOREST.,"Was taken and crucified by the Jews,"
3083,BLACK FOREST.,In that ancient town of Bacharach;
3084,BLACK FOREST.,"Perdition upon those infidel Jews,"
3085,BLACK FOREST.,In that ancient town of Bacharach!
3086,BLACK FOREST.,"The beautiful town, that gives us wine"
3087,BLACK FOREST.,With the fragrant odor of Muscadine!
3088,BLACK FOREST.,I should deem it wrong to let this pass
3089,BLACK FOREST.,"Without first touching my lips to the glass,"
3090,BLACK FOREST.,"For here in the midst of the current I stand,"
3091,BLACK FOREST.,Like the stone Pfalz in the midst of the river
3092,BLACK FOREST.,"Taking toll upon either hand,"
3093,BLACK FOREST.,And much more grateful to the giver.

3100,BLACK FOREST.,"The rascal who drank wine out of a boot,"
3101,BLACK FOREST.,"And, after all, it was not a crime,"
3102,BLACK FOREST.,For he won thereby Dorf Hüffelsheim.
3103,BLACK FOREST.,A jolly old toper! who at a pull
3104,BLACK FOREST.,"Could drink a postilion's jack boot full,"
3105,BLACK FOREST.,"And ask with a laugh, when that was done,"
3106,BLACK FOREST.,If the fellow had left the other one!
3107,BLACK FOREST.,This wine is as good as we can afford
3108,BLACK FOREST.,"To the friars, who sit at the lower board,"
3109,BLACK FOREST.,"And cannot distinguish bad from good,"
3110,BLACK FOREST.,"And are far better off than if they could,"

3279,THE CLOISTERS.,And your revenues large. God's benediction
3280,THE CLOISTERS.,Rests on your convent.
3281,THE CLOISTERS.,
3282,THE CLOISTERS.,_Abbot._ By our charities
3283,THE CLOISTERS.,"We strive to merit it. Our Lord and Master,"
3284,THE CLOISTERS.,"When he departed, left us in his will,"
3285,THE CLOISTERS.,"As our best legacy on earth, the poor!"
3286,THE CLOISTERS.,"These we have always with us; had we not,"
3287,THE CLOISTERS.,Our hearts would grow as hard as are these stones.
3288,THE CLOISTERS.,
3289,THE CLOISTERS.,"_Prince Henry._ If I remember right, the Counts of Calva"
3290,THE CLOISTERS.,Founded your convent.
3291,THE CLOISTERS.,
3292,THE CLOISTERS.,_Abbot._ Even as you say.
3293,THE CLOISTERS.,
3294,THE CLOISTERS.,"_Prince Henry._ And, if I err not, it is very old."
3295,THE CLOISTERS.,
3296,THE CLOISTERS.,_Abbot._ Within these cloisters lie already buried
3297,THE CLOISTERS.,Twelve holy Abbots. Underneath the flags
3298,THE CLOISTERS.,"On which we stand, the Abbot William lies,"
3299,THE CLOISTERS.,Of blessed memory.
3300,THE CLOISTERS.,
3301,THE CLOISTERS.,"_Prince Henry._ And whose tomb is that,"
3302,THE CLOISTERS.,Which bears the brass escutcheon?
3303,THE CLOISTERS.,
3304,THE CLOISTERS.,_Abbot._ A benefactor's.
3305,THE CLOISTERS.,"Conrad, a Count of Calva, he who stood"
3306,THE CLOISTERS.,Godfather to our bells.
3307,THE CLOISTERS.,
3308,THE CLOISTERS.,_Prince Henry._ Your monks are learned
3309,THE CLOISTERS.,"And holy men, I trust."
3310,THE CLOISTERS.,
3311,THE CLOISTERS.,_Abbot._ There are among them
3312,THE CLOISTERS.,Learned and holy men. Yet in this age
3313,THE CLOISTERS.,"We need another Hildebrand, to shake"
3314,THE CLOISTERS.,And purify us like a mighty wind.
3315,THE CLOISTERS.,"The world is wicked, and sometimes I wonder"
3316,THE CLOISTERS.,"God does not lose his patience with it wholly,"
3317,THE CLOISTERS.,"And shatter it like glass! Even here, at times,"
3318,THE CLOISTERS.,"Within these walls, where all should be at peace,"
3319,THE CLOISTERS.,I have my trials. Time has laid his hand
3320,THE CLOISTERS.,"Upon my heart, gently, not smiting it,"
3321,THE CLOISTERS.,But as a harper lays his open palm
3322,THE CLOISTERS.,"Upon his harp, to deaden its vibrations."
3323,THE CLOISTERS.,"Ashes are on my head, and on my lips"
3324,THE CLOISTERS.,"Sackcloth, and in my breast a heaviness"
3325,THE CLOISTERS.,"And weariness of life, that makes me ready"
3326,THE CLOISTERS.,"To say to the dead Abbots under us,"
3327,THE CLOISTERS.,"""Make room for me!"" Only I see the dusk"
3328,THE CLOISTERS.,"Of evening twilight coming, and have not"
3329,THE CLOISTERS.,Completed half my task; and so at times
3330,THE CLOISTERS.,The thought of my shortcomings in this life
3331,THE CLOISTERS.,Falls like a shadow on the life to come.
3332,THE CLOISTERS.,
3333,THE CLOISTERS.,"_Prince Henry._ We must all die, and not the old alone;"
3334,THE CLOISTERS.,The young have no exemption from that doom.
3335,THE CLOISTERS.,
3336,THE CLOISTERS.,"_Abbot._ Ah, yes! the young may die, but the old must!"
3337,THE CLOISTERS.,That is the difference.
3338,THE CLOISTERS.,
3339,THE CLOISTERS.,_Prince Henry._ I have heard much laud
3340,THE CLOISTERS.,Of your transcribers. Your Scriptorium
3341,THE CLOISTERS.,"Is famous among all, your manuscripts"
3342,THE CLOISTERS.,Praised for their beauty and their excellence.
3343,THE CLOISTERS.,
3344,THE CLOISTERS.,"_Abbot._ That is indeed our boast. If you desire it,"
3345,THE CLOISTERS.,You shall behold these treasures. And meanwhile
3346,THE CLOISTERS.,Shall the Refectorarius bestow
3347,THE CLOISTERS.,Your horses and attendants for the night.

3528,THE REFECTORY.,"Free and easy look and air,"
3529,THE REFECTORY.,As if he were used to such feasting and frollicking?

3584,THE REFECTORY.,"Roaring louder than they,"
3585,THE REFECTORY.,"With their strong wines,"
3586,THE REFECTORY.,"And their concubines,"
3587,THE REFECTORY.,"And never a bell,"
3588,THE REFECTORY.,"With its swagger and swell,"
3589,THE REFECTORY.,Calling you up with a start of affright
3590,THE REFECTORY.,"In the dead of night,"
3591,THE REFECTORY.,"To send you grumbling down dark stairs,"
3592,THE REFECTORY.,"To mumble your prayers,"
3593,THE REFECTORY.,But the cheery crow
3594,THE REFECTORY.,"Of cocks in the yard below,"
3595,THE REFECTORY.,"After daybreak, an hour or so,"
3596,THE REFECTORY.,"And the barking of deep-mouthed hounds,"

3598,THE REFECTORY.,"That, instead of bells, salute the ear."
3599,THE REFECTORY.,And then all day
3600,THE REFECTORY.,Up and away
3601,THE REFECTORY.,"Through the forest, hunting the deer!"
3602,THE REFECTORY.,"Ah, my friends! I'm afraid that here"
3603,THE REFECTORY.,"You are a little too pious, a little too tame,"
3604,THE REFECTORY.,"And the more is the shame,"
3605,THE REFECTORY.,It is the greatest folly
3606,THE REFECTORY.,Not to be jolly;
3607,THE REFECTORY.,That's what I think!

3644,THE REFECTORY.,
3645,THE REFECTORY.,"_Friar Cuthbert._ It is only a poor, unfortunate brother,"

3647,THE REFECTORY.,"Of getting up at all sorts of hours,"
3648,THE REFECTORY.,"And, by way of penance and Christian meekness,"
3649,THE REFECTORY.,Of creeping silently out of his cell
3650,THE REFECTORY.,To take a pull at that hideous bell;
3651,THE REFECTORY.,So that all the monks who are lying awake
3652,THE REFECTORY.,"May murmur some kind of prayer for his sake,"

3657,THE REFECTORY.,"_All._ Good Lord, deliver us all!"
3658,THE REFECTORY.,
3659,THE REFECTORY.,"_Friar Cuthbert._ And before the bell for matins sounds,"
3660,THE REFECTORY.,"He takes his lantern, and goes the rounds,"
3661,THE REFECTORY.,"Flashing it into our sleepy eyes,"
3662,THE REFECTORY.,Merely to say it is time to arise.
3663,THE REFECTORY.,"But enough of that. Go on, if you please,"
3664,THE REFECTORY.,With your story about St. Gildas de Rhuys.

3668,THE REFECTORY.,One Sunday at Mass
3669,THE REFECTORY.,We put some poison into the chalice.
3670,THE REFECTORY.,"But, either by accident or design,"
3671,THE REFECTORY.,Peter Abelard kept away
3672,THE REFECTORY.,"From the chapel that day,"

3676,THE REFECTORY.,But look! do you see at the window there
3677,THE REFECTORY.,"That face, with a look of grief and despair,"
3678,THE REFECTORY.,"That ghastly face, as of one in pain?"
3679,THE REFECTORY.,
3680,THE REFECTORY.,_Monks._ Who? where?

3685,THE REFECTORY.,Siebald the Refectorarius.
3686,THE REFECTORY.,"That fellow is always playing the scout,"
3687,THE REFECTORY.,Creeping and peeping and prowling about;
3688,THE REFECTORY.,And then he regales
3689,THE REFECTORY.,The Abbot with Scandalous tales.
3690,THE REFECTORY.,
3691,THE REFECTORY.,_Lucifer_. A spy in the convent? One of the brothers
3692,THE REFECTORY.,Telling scandalous tales of the others?
3693,THE REFECTORY.,"Out upon him, the lazy loon!"
3694,THE REFECTORY.,"I would put a stop to that pretty soon,"
3695,THE REFECTORY.,In a way he should rue it.
3696,THE REFECTORY.,
3697,THE REFECTORY.,_Monks_. How shall we do it?
3698,THE REFECTORY.,
3699,THE REFECTORY.,"_Lucifer_. Do you, brother Paul,"
3700,THE REFECTORY.,"Creep under the window, close to the wall,"
3701,THE REFECTORY.,And open it suddenly when I call.
3702,THE REFECTORY.,"Then seize the villain by the hair,"
3703,THE REFECTORY.,"And hold him there,"
3704,THE REFECTORY.,"And punish him soundly, once for all."
3705,THE REFECTORY.,
3706,THE REFECTORY.,"_Friar Cuthbert_. As St. Dustan of old,"
3707,THE REFECTORY.,"We are told,"
3708,THE REFECTORY.,Once caught the Devil by the nose!
3709,THE REFECTORY.,
3710,THE REFECTORY.,"_Lucifer_. Ha! ha! that story is very clever,"
3711,THE REFECTORY.,But has no foundation whatsoever.
3712,THE REFECTORY.,Quick! for I see his face again
3713,THE REFECTORY.,Glaring in at the window pane;
3714,THE REFECTORY.,Now! now! and do not spare your blows.

3718,THE REFECTORY.,
3719,THE REFECTORY.,_Friar Siebald_. Help! help! are you going to slay me?
3720,THE REFECTORY.,
3721,THE REFECTORY.,_Friar Paul_. That will teach you again to betray me!
3722,THE REFECTORY.,
3723,THE REFECTORY.,_Friar Siebald_. Mercy! mercy!
3724,THE REFECTORY.,
3725,THE REFECTORY.,"_Friar Paul_ (_shouting and beating_). Rumpas bellorum lorum,"
3726,THE REFECTORY.,Vim confer amorum

3728,THE REFECTORY.,Tu plena polorum!
3729,THE REFECTORY.,
3730,THE REFECTORY.,"_Lucifer_. Who stands in the doorway yonder,"
3731,THE REFECTORY.,"Stretching out his trembling hand,"
3732,THE REFECTORY.,"Just as Abelard used to stand,"
3733,THE REFECTORY.,"The flash of his keen, black eyes"
3734,THE REFECTORY.,Forerunning the thunder?
3735,THE REFECTORY.,
3736,THE REFECTORY.,_The Monks (in confusion)_. The Abbot! the
3737,THE REFECTORY.,Abbot!
3738,THE REFECTORY.,
3739,THE REFECTORY.,_Friar Cuthbert (to the girl)_. Put on your disguise!
3740,THE REFECTORY.,
3741,THE REFECTORY.,_Friar Francis_.  Hide the great flagon
3742,THE REFECTORY.,From the eyes of the dragon!
3743,THE REFECTORY.,
3744,THE REFECTORY.,"_Friar Cuthbert_. Pull the brown hood over your face,"
3745,THE REFECTORY.,Lest you bring me into disgrace!
3746,THE REFECTORY.,
3747,THE REFECTORY.,_Abbot_. What means this revel and carouse?
3748,THE REFECTORY.,Is this a tavern and drinking-house?
3749,THE REFECTORY.,"Are you Christian monks, or heathen devils,"
3750,THE REFECTORY.,To pollute this convent with your revels?
3751,THE REFECTORY.,"Were Peter Damian still upon earth,"
3752,THE REFECTORY.,"To be shocked by such ungodly mirth,"
3753,THE REFECTORY.,"He would write your names, with pen of gall,"
3754,THE REFECTORY.,"In his Book of Gomorrah, one and all!"
3755,THE REFECTORY.,"Away, you drunkards! to your cells,"
3756,THE REFECTORY.,And pray till you hear the matin-bells;
3757,THE REFECTORY.,"You, Brother Francis, and you, Brother Paul!"
3758,THE REFECTORY.,And as a penance mark each prayer
3759,THE REFECTORY.,With the scourge upon your shoulders bare;
3760,THE REFECTORY.,Nothing atones for such a sin
3761,THE REFECTORY.,But the blood that follows the discipline.
3762,THE REFECTORY.,"And you, Brother Cuthbert, come with me"
3763,THE REFECTORY.,Alone into the sacristy;
3764,THE REFECTORY.,"You, who should be a guide to your brothers,"
3765,THE REFECTORY.,"And are ten times worse than all the others,"
3766,THE REFECTORY.,For you I've a draught that has long been brewing
3767,THE REFECTORY.,You shall do a penance worth the doing!
3768,THE REFECTORY.,"Away to your prayers, then, one and all!"
3769,THE REFECTORY.,"I wonder the very, convent wall"

3793,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Gone are the anguish, the terror, and pain;"

3795,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"O'er whose burning sands I was forced to go,"
3796,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,A wind from heaven began to blow;

3809,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,For every soul is akin to me

3818,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Love, that of every woman's heart"
3819,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Will have the whole, and not a part,"
3820,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"That is to her, in Nature's plan,"
3821,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"More than ambition is to man,"
3822,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Her light, her life, her very breath,"
3823,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"With no alternative but death,"
3824,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Found me a maiden soft and young,"
3825,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Just from the convent's cloistered school,"
3826,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And seated on my lowly stool,"
3827,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Attentive while the minstrels sung.

3834,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,His song was of the summer-time
3835,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,The very birds sang in his rhyme;
3836,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"The sunshine, the delicious air,"
3837,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"The fragrance of the flowers, were there,"
3838,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And I grew restless as I heard,"

3840,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Down soft, aërial currents sailing,"
3841,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"O'er blossomed orchards, and fields in bloom,"
3842,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,And through the momentary gloom
3843,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Of shadows o'er the landscape trailing,"
3844,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Yielding and borne I knew not where,"
3845,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,But feeling resistance unavailing.
3846,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,
3847,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And thus, unnoticed and apart,"
3848,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,And more by accident than choice.
3849,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,I listened to that single voice
3850,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Until the chambers of my heart
3851,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Were filled with it by night and day,"
3852,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"One night,--it was a night in May,--"
3853,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Within the garden, unawares,"
3854,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Under the blossoms in the gloom,"
3855,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,I heard it utter my own name
3856,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,With protestations and wild prayers;
3857,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And it rang through me, and became"
3858,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Like the archangel's trump of doom,"
3859,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Which the soul hears, and must obey;"
3860,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,And mine arose as from a tomb.
3861,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,My former life now seemed to me
3862,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Such as hereafter death may be,"
3863,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,When in the great Eternity
3864,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,We shall awake and find it day.
3865,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,
3866,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"It was a dream, and would not stay;"
3867,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"A dream, that in a single night"
3868,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Faded and vanished out of sight.
3869,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,My father's anger followed fast
3870,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"This passion, as a freshening blast"
3871,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Seeks out and fans the fire, whose rage"
3872,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"It may increase, but not assuage."
3873,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And he exclaimed: ""No wandering bard"
3874,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Shall win thy hand, O Irmingard!"
3875,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,For which Prince Henry of Hoheneck
3876,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"By messenger and letter sues."""
3877,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,
3878,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Gently, but firmly, I replied:"
3879,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"""Henry of Hoheneck I discard!"
3880,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Never the hand of Irmingard
3881,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Shall lie in his as the hand of a bride!"""
3882,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"This said I, Walter, for thy sake:"
3883,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"This said I, for I could not choose."
3884,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"After a pause, my father spake"
3885,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,In that cold and deliberate tone
3886,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Which turns the hearer into stone,"
3887,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,And seems itself the act to be
3888,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,That follows with such dread certainty;
3889,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"""This, or the cloister and the veil!"""
3890,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"No other words than these he said,"
3891,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,But they were like a funeral wail;
3892,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"My life was ended, my heart was dead."
3893,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,
3894,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"That night from the castle-gate went down,"
3895,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"With silent, slow, and stealthy pace,"
3896,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Two shadows, mounted on shadowy steeds,"
3897,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Taking the narrow path that leads
3898,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Into the forest dense and brown,"
3899,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"In the leafy darkness of the place,"
3900,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"One could not distinguish form nor face,"
3901,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Only a bulk without a shape,"
3902,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,A darker shadow in the shade;
3903,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"One scarce could say it moved or stayed,"
3904,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Thus it was we made our escape!
3905,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"A foaming brook, with many a bound,"
3906,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Followed us like a playful hound;
3907,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Then leaped before us, and in the hollow"
3908,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Paused, and waited for us to follow,"
3909,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And seemed impatient, and afraid"
3910,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,That our tardy flight should be betrayed
3911,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"By the sound our horses' hoof-beats made,"
3912,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And when we reached the plain below,"
3913,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,He paused a moment and drew rein
3914,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,To look back at the castle again;
3915,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,And we saw the windows all aglow
3916,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"With lights, that were passing to and fro;"
3917,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Our hearts with terror ceased to beat;
3918,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,The brook crept silent to our feet;
3919,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,We knew what most we feared to know.
3920,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Then suddenly horns began to blow;
3921,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And we heard a shout, and a heavy tramp,"
3922,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,And our horses snorted in the damp
3923,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Night-air of the meadows green and wide,"
3924,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And in a moment, side by side,"
3925,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"So close, they must have seemed but one,"
3926,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"The shadows across the moonlight run,"
3927,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And another came, and swept behind,"
3928,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Like the shadow of clouds before the wind!
3929,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,
3930,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,How I remember that breathless flight
3931,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Across the moors, in the summer night!"
3932,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"How under our feet the long, white road"
3933,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Backward like a river flowed,"
3934,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Sweeping with it fences and hedges,"
3935,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Whilst farther away, and overhead,"
3936,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Paler than I, with fear and dread,"
3937,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"The moon fled with us, as we fled"
3938,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Along the forest's jagged edges!
3939,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,
3940,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,All this I can remember well;
3941,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,But of what afterward befell
3942,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,I nothing farther can recall
3943,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Than a blind, desperate, headlong fall;"
3944,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,The rest is a blank and darkness all.
3945,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"When I awoke out of this swoon,"
3946,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"The sun was shining, not the moon,"
3947,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Making a cross upon the wall
3948,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,With the bars of my windows narrow and tall;
3949,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And I prayed to it, as I had been wont to pray,"
3950,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"From early childhood, day by day,"
3951,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Each morning, as in bed I lay!"
3952,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,I was lying again in my own room!
3953,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And I thanked God, in my fever and pain,"
3954,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,That those shadows on the midnight plain
3955,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Were gone, and could not come again!"
3956,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,I struggled no longer with my doom!
3957,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,This happened many years ago.
3958,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,I left my father's home to come
3959,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Like Catherine to her martyrdom,"
3960,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,For blindly I esteemed it so.
3961,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,And when I heard the convent door
3962,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Behind me close, to ope no more,"
3963,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"I felt it smite me like a blow,"
3964,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Through all my limbs a shudder ran,"
3965,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,And on my bruised spirit fell
3966,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,The dampness of my narrow cell
3967,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"As night-air on a wounded man,"
3968,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Giving intolerable pain.
3969,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,
3970,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"But now a better life began,"
3971,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,I felt the agony decrease
3972,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"By slow degrees, then wholly cease,"
3973,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Ending in perfect rest and peace!
3974,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"It was not apathy, nor dulness,"
3975,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"That weighed and pressed upon my brain,"
3976,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,But the same passion I had given
3977,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"To earth before, now turned to heaven"
3978,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,With all its overflowing fulness.
3979,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,
3980,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Alas! the world is full of peril!
3981,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"The path that runs through the fairest meads,"
3982,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"On the sunniest side of the valley, leads"
3983,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Into a region bleak and sterile!
3984,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Alike in the high-born and the lowly,"
3985,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"The will is feeble, and passion strong."
3986,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,We cannot sever right from wrong;
3987,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Some falsehood mingles with all truth;
3988,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Nor is it strange the heart of youth
3989,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Should waver and comprehend but slowly
3990,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,The things that are holy and unholy!
3991,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,
3992,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"But in this sacred and calm retreat,"
3993,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,We are all well and safely shielded
3994,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"From winds that blow, and waves that beat,"
3995,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"From the cold, and rain, and blighting heat,"
3996,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,To which the strongest hearts have yielded.
3997,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Here we stand as the Virgins Seven,"
3998,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,For our celestial bridegroom yearning;
3999,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Our hearts are lamps forever burning,"
4000,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"With a steady and unwavering flame,"
4001,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Pointing upward, forever the same,"
4002,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Steadily upward toward the Heaven!
4003,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,
4004,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,The moon is hidden behind a cloud;
4005,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"A sudden darkness fills the room,"
4006,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"And thy deep eyes, amid the gloom,"
4007,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Shine like jewels in a shroud.
4008,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,On the leaves is a sound of falling rain;
4009,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"A bird, awakened in its nest,"
4010,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Gives a faint twitter of unrest,"
4011,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Then smoothes its plumes and sleeps again.
4012,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,
4013,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,No other sounds than these I hear;
4014,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,The hour of midnight must be near.
4015,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Thou art o'erspent with the day's fatigue
4016,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,Of riding many a dusty league;
4017,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Sink, then, gently to thy slumber;"
4018,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Me so many cares encumber,"
4019,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"So many ghosts, and forms of fright,"
4020,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,"Have started from their graves to-night,"
4021,THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.,They have driven sleep from mine eyes away:

4732,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,I hardly yet have had time to discern.
4733,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"So much, at least, I am bound to acknowledge:"
4734,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"The air seems healthy, the buildings stately,"
4735,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And on the whole I like it greatly.
4736,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4737,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"_First Scholar_. Yes, the air is sweet; the Calabrian hills"
4738,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Send us down puffs of mountain air;
4739,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And in summer time the sea-breeze fills
4740,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"With its coolness cloister, and court, and square."
4741,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Then at every season of the year
4742,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,There are crowds of guests and travellers here;
4743,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Pilgrims, and mendicant friars, and traders"
4744,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"From the Levant, with figs and wine,"
4745,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And bands of wounded and sick Crusaders,"
4746,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Coming back from Palestine.
4747,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4748,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Second Scholar_. And what are the studies you pursue?
4749,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,What is the course you here go through?
4750,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4751,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_First Scholar_. The first three years of the college course
4752,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Are given to Logic alone, as the source"
4753,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Of all that is noble, and wise, and true."
4754,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4755,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"_Second Scholar_. That seems rather strange, I must confess."
4756,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"In a Medical School; yet, nevertheless,"
4757,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,You doubtless have reasons for that.
4758,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4759,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_First Scholar_.  Oh yes!
4760,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,For none but a clever dialectician
4761,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Can hope to become a great physician;
4762,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,That has been settled long ago.
4763,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Logic makes an important part
4764,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Of the mystery of the healing art;
4765,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,For without it how could you hope to show
4766,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,That nobody knows so much as you know?
4767,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,After this there are five years more
4768,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Devoted wholly to medicine,"
4769,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"With lectures on chirurgical lore,"
4770,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And dissections of the bodies of swine,"
4771,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,As likest the human form divine.
4772,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4773,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Second Scholar_. What are the books now most in vogue?
4774,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4775,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_First Scholar_. Quite an extensive catalogue;
4776,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Mostly, however, books of our own;"
4777,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"As Gariopontus' Passionarius,"
4778,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And the writings of Matthew Platearius;
4779,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And a volume universally known
4780,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"As the Regimen of the School of Salern,"
4781,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,For Robert of Normandy written in terse
4782,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And very elegant Latin verse.
4783,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Each of these writings has its turn.
4784,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And when at length we have finished these,"
4785,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Then comes the struggle for degrees,"
4786,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,With all the oldest and ablest critics;
4787,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"The public thesis and disputation,"
4788,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Question, and answer, and explanation"
4789,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Of a passage out of Hippocrates,"
4790,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Or Aristotle's Analytics.
4791,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,There the triumphant Magister stands!
4792,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"A book is solemnly placed in his hands,"
4793,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,On which he swears to follow the rule
4794,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And ancient forms of the good old School;
4795,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,To report if any confectionarius
4796,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Mingles his drugs with matters various,"
4797,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And to visit his patients twice a day,"
4798,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And once in the night, if they live in town,"
4799,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And if they are poor, to take no pay."
4800,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Having faithfully promised these,"
4801,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,His head is crowned with a laurel crown;
4802,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"A kiss on his cheek, a ring on his hand,"
4803,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,The Magister Artium et Physices
4804,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Goes forth from the school like a lord of the land.
4805,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And now, as we have the whole morning before us"
4806,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Let us go in, if you make no objection,"
4807,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And listen awhile to a learned prelection
4808,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,On Marcus Aurelius Cassiodorus.
4809,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4810,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,(_They go in. Enter_ LUCIFER _as a Doctor._)
4811,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4812,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Lucifer_.  This is the great School of Salern!
4813,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"A land of wrangling and of quarrels,"
4814,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Of brains that seethe, and hearts that burn,"
4815,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Where every emulous scholar hears,"
4816,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"In every breath that comes to his ears,"
4817,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,The rustling of another's laurels!
4818,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,The air of the place is called salubrious;
4819,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,The neighborhood of Vesuvius lends it
4820,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"An odor volcanic, that rather mends it,"
4821,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And the buildings have an aspect lugubrious,"
4822,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,That inspires a feeling of awe and terror
4823,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Into the heart of the beholder,"
4824,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And befits such an ancient homestead of error,"
4825,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Where the old falsehoods moulder and smoulder,"
4826,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And yearly by many hundred hands
4827,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Are carried away, in the zeal of youth,"
4828,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And sown like tares in the field of truth,"
4829,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,To blossom and ripen in other lands.
4830,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"What have we here, affixed to the gate?"
4831,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"The challenge of some scholastic wight,"
4832,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Who wishes to hold a public debate
4833,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,On sundry questions wrong or right!
4834,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Ah, now this is my great delight!"
4835,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,For I have often observed of late
4836,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,That such discussions end in a fight.
4837,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Let us see what the learned wag maintains
4838,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,With such a prodigal waste of brains.
4839,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4840,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,(_Reads._)
4841,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4842,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"""Whether angels in moving from place to place"
4843,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Pass through the intermediate space.
4844,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Whether God himself is the author of evil,"

4846,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"When, where, and wherefore Lucifer fell,"
4847,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And whether he now is chained in hell."""
4848,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4849,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,I think I can answer that question well!
4850,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,So long as the boastful human mind
4851,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Consents in such mills as this to grind,"
4852,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,I sit very firmly upon my throne!
4853,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Of a truth it almost makes me laugh,"

4855,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,To gather in piles the pitiful chaff
4856,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"That old Peter Lombard thrashed with his brain,"
4857,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,To have it caught up and tossed again
4858,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,On the horns of the Dumb Ox of Cologne!

4860,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,But my guests approach! there is in the air
4861,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"A fragrance, like that of the Beautiful Garden"
4862,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Of Paradise, in the days that were!"
4863,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"An odor of innocence, and of prayer,"
4864,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And of love, and faith that never fails,"
4865,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Which as the fresh-young heart exhales
4866,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Before it begins to wither and harden!
4867,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,I cannot breathe such an atmosphere!
4868,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"My soul is filled with a nameless fear,"
4869,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"That, after all my trouble and pain,"
4870,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"After all my restless endeavor,"
4871,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"The youngest, fairest soul of the twain,"
4872,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"The most ethereal, most divine,"
4873,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Will escape from my hands forever and ever.
4874,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,But the other is already mine!
4875,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Let him live to corrupt his race,"
4876,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Breathing among them, with every breath,"
4877,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Weakness, selfishness, and the base"
4878,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And pusillanimous fear of death.
4879,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"I know his nature, and I know"

4881,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Wander the great earth to and fro,"
4882,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And on my errands come and go,"
4883,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,The safest and subtlest are such as he.
4884,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4885,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,(_Enter_ PRINCE HENRY _and_ ELSIE _with
4886,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,attendants_.)
4887,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4888,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Prince Henry._ Can you direct us to Friar Angelo?
4889,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4890,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Lucifer._ He stands before you.
4891,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4892,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Prince Henry._ Then you know our purpose.
4893,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"I am Prince Henry of Hoheneck, and this"
4894,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,The maiden that I spake of in my letters.
4895,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4896,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Lucifer._ It is a very grave and solemn business!
4897,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,We must not be precipitate. Does she
4898,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Without compulsion, of her own free will,"
4899,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Consent to this?
4900,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4901,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"_Prince Henry._ Against all opposition,"
4902,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Against all prayers, entreaties, protestations."
4903,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,She will not be persuaded.
4904,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4905,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Lucifer._ That is strange!
4906,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Have you thought well of it?
4907,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4908,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Elsie._   I come not here
4909,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"To argue, but to die. Your business is not"
4910,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"to question, but to kill me. I am ready."
4911,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,I am impatient to be gone from here
4912,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Ere any thoughts of earth disturb again
4913,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,The spirit of tranquillity within me.
4914,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4915,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Prince Henry._ Would I had not come here
4916,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Would I were dead,"
4917,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And thou wert in thy cottage in the forest,"
4918,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And hadst not known me! Why have I done this?
4919,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Let me go back and die.
4920,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4921,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Elsie._ It cannot be;
4922,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Not if these cold, flat stones on which we tread"
4923,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Were coulters heated white, and yonder gateway"
4924,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Flamed like a furnace with a sevenfold heat.
4925,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,I must fulfil my purpose.
4926,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4927,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Prince Henry._ I forbid it!
4928,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Not one step farther. For I only meant
4929,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,To put thus far thy courage to the proof.
4930,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"It is enough. I, too, have courage to die,"
4931,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,For thou hast taught me!
4932,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4933,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Elsie._ O my Prince! remember
4934,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Your promises. Let me fulfill my errand.
4935,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,You do not look on life and death as I do.
4936,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"There are two angels, that attend unseen"
4937,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Each one of us, and in great books record"
4938,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Our good and evil deeds. He who writes down
4939,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"The good ones, after every action closes"
4940,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"His volume, and ascends with it to God."
4941,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,The other keeps his dreadful day-book open
4942,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Till sunset, that we may repent; which doing,"
4943,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"The record of the action fades away,"
4944,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And leaves a line of white across the page.
4945,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Now if my act be good, as I believe it,"
4946,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,It cannot be recalled. It is already
4947,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Sealed up in heaven, as a good deed accomplished."
4948,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,The rest is yours. Why wait you? I am ready.
4949,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,

4952,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Weep not, my friends! rather rejoice with me."
4953,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"I shall not feel the pain, but shall be gone,"
4954,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And you will have another friend in heaven.
4955,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Then start not at the creaking of the door
4956,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Through which I pass. I see what lies beyond it.
4957,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4958,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,(_To_ PRINCE HENRY.)
4959,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4960,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And you, O Prince! bear back my benison"

4965,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"God will take care of them, they need me not."
4966,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And in your life let my remembrance linger,"
4967,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"As something not to trouble and disturb it,"
4968,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"But to complete it, adding life to life."
4969,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And if at times beside the evening fire
4970,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"You see my face among the other faces,"
4971,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Let it not be regarded as a ghost
4972,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"That haunts your house, but as a guest that loves you."
4973,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Nay, even as one of your own family,"
4974,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Without whose presence there were something wanting.
4975,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,I have no more to say. Let us go in.
4976,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4977,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"_Prince Henry._ Friar Angelo! I charge you on your life,"
4978,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Believe not what she says, for she is mad,"
4979,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And comes here not to die, but to be healed."
4980,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4981,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Elsie._ Alas! Prince Henry!
4982,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4983,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Lucifer._ Come with me; this way.

4989,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,A sudden darkness falls upon the world!
4990,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4991,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Forester._ News from the Prince!
4992,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4993,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Ursula._ Of death or life?
4994,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4995,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Forester._ You put your questions eagerly!
4996,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4997,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"_Ursula._ Answer me, then!  How is the Prince?"
4998,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
4999,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Forester._ I left him only two hours since

5004,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"_Ursula (despairing)._ Then Elsie, my poor child, is dead!"
5005,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
5006,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"_Forester._  That, my good woman, I have not said."
5007,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Don't cross the bridge till you come to it,"
5008,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Is a proverb old, and of excellent wit."
5009,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
5010,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Ursula._ Keep me no longer in this pain!
5011,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
5012,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Forester._ It is true your daughter is no more;--
5013,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"That is, the peasant she was before."
5014,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
5015,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Ursula._ Alas! I am simple and lowly bred
5016,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"I am poor, distracted, and forlorn."
5017,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And it is not well that you of the court
5018,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Should mock me thus, and make a sport"
5019,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Of a joyless mother whose child is dead,"
5020,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"For you, too, were of mother, born!"

5023,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,You will learn ere long how it all befell.
5024,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Her heart for a moment never failed;
5025,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"But when they reached Salerno's gate,"
5026,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"The Prince's nobler self prevailed,"
5027,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And saved her for a nobler fate,"
5028,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"And he was healed, in his despair,"
5029,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,By the touch of St. Matthew's sacred bones;
5030,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"Though I think the long ride in the open air,"
5031,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"That pilgrimage over stocks and stones,"

5045,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Forester._ I did not tell you she was dead;

5056,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,_Ursula._ Jesu Maria! what a change!
5057,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,All seems to me so weird and strange!
5058,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,
5059,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"_Forester._ I saw her standing on the deck,"
5060,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Beneath an awning cool and shady;
5061,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Her cap of velvet could not hold
5062,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"The tresses of her hair of gold,"
5063,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,"That flowed and floated like the stream,"
5064,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,And fell in masses down her neck.
5065,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,As fair and lovely did she seem
5066,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,As in a story or a dream
5067,THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.,Some beautiful and foreign lady.
