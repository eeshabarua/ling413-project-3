32,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,_The crowning pleasure in the compilation of this book is the
33,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,"permission to dedicate it to you, and this token of personal admiration"
34,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,"is not without special fitness, since you were among the earliest to"
35,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,"experiment in these French rhythms, and to introduce_ CHARLES D'ORLÉANS"
36,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,_and_ FRANÇOIS VILLON _to the majority of English readers_.

38,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,"_""Those old French ways of verse making that have been coming into"
39,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,fashion of late. Surely they say a pretty thing more prettily for
40,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,their quaint old-fashioned liberty! That_ TRIOLET--_how deliciously
41,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,impertinent it is! is it not?... The variety of dainty modes wherein
42,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,by shape and sound a very pretty something is carved out of nothing at
43,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,"all. Their fantastic surprises, the ring of their bell-like returns"
44,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,"upon themselves, their music of triangle and cymbal. In some of"
45,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,them poetry seems to approach the nearest possible to bird-song--to
46,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,"unconscious seeming through most unconscious art, imitating the"
47,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,"carelessness and impromptu of forms as old as the existence of birds,"
48,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,"and as new as every fresh individual joy in each new generation,"
49,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,"growing their own feathers, and singing their own song, yet always the"
50,NEW YORK: 3 EAST FOURTEENTH STREET.,"feathers of their kind, and the song of their kind.""--_"

767,PREFACE.,"fixed forms of the _ballade_, _chant royal_, _kyrielle_, _rondel_,"
768,PREFACE.,"_rondeau_, _rondeau redoublé_, _sestina_, _triolet_, _villanelle_, and"
769,PREFACE.,"_virelai_, with the addition of the _pantoum_. That such a choice is"
770,PREFACE.,"the result of circumstances it is needless to point out, since only"
771,PREFACE.,those that had found favour with English writers were available for
772,PREFACE.,"the purpose. So far as I know, this collection is the first of its"
773,PREFACE.,"sort, although Mr. W. Davenport Adams' _Latter Day Lyrics_ included a"
774,PREFACE.,"section chosen on the same lines. Having, in company, no doubt, with"
775,PREFACE.,"many others, a genuine regard for the group Mr. Adams included there,"
776,PREFACE.,I had long hoped to see a more ample compilation of later work in
777,PREFACE.,this school; but notwithstanding the steady increase in the number of
778,PREFACE.,"poems written in the forms systematically arranged herein, the ground"
779,PREFACE.,"remained unoccupied, until the appearance of this book; which may"
780,PREFACE.,"fairly claim to be the first in the field, since no other volume has"
781,PREFACE.,"devoted its whole space to them, save in the rarer cases, where an"
782,PREFACE.,"author has published a collection of original poems cast in one mould,"
783,PREFACE.,notably Mr. Swinburne's _Century of Roundels_ and Mr. Andrew Lang's
784,PREFACE.,_Ballades in Blue China_.
785,PREFACE.,
786,PREFACE.,In Mr. Adams' volume another valuable feature was the _Note on some
787,PREFACE.,"Foreign forms of Verse_ by Mr. Austin Dobson, which many years since"
788,PREFACE.,introduced to me the laws of the various forms and created my special
789,PREFACE.,interest in them. It is no derogation to the charming group in the
790,PREFACE.,"former volume to say of the present collection, that it far exceeds its"
791,PREFACE.,"predecessor in number and variety, for now there is a wide field to"
792,PREFACE.,"choose from, whereas Mr. Adams was then limited to a selection from the"
793,PREFACE.,small number extant.
794,PREFACE.,
795,PREFACE.,The rules which Mr. Austin Dobson was the first to formulate in English
796,PREFACE.,"are made the basis (side by side with the treatises of M. de Gramont,"
797,PREFACE.,"M. de Banville, and other authorities) of the following chapter on the"
798,PREFACE.,rules of the various forms. Lest a name so intimately associated with
799,PREFACE.,the introduction of the old French metrical shapes in English poetry
800,PREFACE.,"should appear to be brought in to add weight to my own attempt, and"
801,PREFACE.,the reputation of a master invoked for the work of one who at furthest
802,PREFACE.,"can but style himself an apprentice, I must ask that this necessary"
803,PREFACE.,tribute to Mr. Dobson's labours be taken only as an apology for so
804,PREFACE.,"freely using his material, and that his ready help is by no means to"
805,PREFACE.,be regarded in the faintest way as an imprimatur of any statements in
806,PREFACE.,"this prefatory matter, save those quoted avowedly and directly from his"
807,PREFACE.,writings.
808,PREFACE.,
809,PREFACE.,It may be best to name at once the authorities who have been consulted
810,PREFACE.,in the preparation of the introductory chapter. These include the
811,PREFACE.,"French treatises of De Banville, De Gramont, and Jullienne, Mr."
812,PREFACE.,"Saintsbury's _Short History of French Literature_, Mr. Hueffers'"
813,PREFACE.,"_Troubadours_, an article by Mr. Gosse in the _Cornhill Magazine_,"
814,PREFACE.,"July 1877, _Les Villanelles_ by M. Joseph Boulmier, _The Rhymester_ of"
815,PREFACE.,"Mr. Brander Matthews, and many occasional papers on the various forms"
816,PREFACE.,that have appeared in English and American periodicals. To arrange in
817,PREFACE.,one chapter the materials gathered from these and other sources is all
818,PREFACE.,that I have attempted. If at times the need to crowd enough matter for
819,PREFACE.,"a volume into the limits of a few pages results in a want of lucidity,"
820,PREFACE.,"I must plead the necessity imposed by limited space. To those who, by"
821,PREFACE.,"their kindly permission, have allowed their poems to be quoted here,"
822,PREFACE.,the thanks that I can offer are as hearty as the expression of my
823,PREFACE.,gratitude is brief. The somewhat onerous task of obtaining consent
824,PREFACE.,"from about two hundred authors has been turned to a pleasure, by the"
825,PREFACE.,"evidence of interest taken in this, the first collection of the later"
826,PREFACE.,growth of this branch of poetic art. Nor did the help cease with the
827,PREFACE.,loan of the poems; in many instances a correspondence followed that
828,PREFACE.,"brought to light fresh material, both for the body of the book and the"
829,PREFACE.,"introductory chapter, and rendered assistance not easy to overvalue."
830,PREFACE.,"If any writer is quoted without direct permission, it was through"
831,PREFACE.,"no want of effort to trace him, excepting in the case of a very few"
832,PREFACE.,"that reached me in the shape of newspaper cuttings, wholly devoid of"
833,PREFACE.,any clue to the locality of the writer. To Mr. Austin Dobson my best
834,PREFACE.,thanks are due. From Mr. Andrew Lang and Mr. Edmund Gosse I have also
835,PREFACE.,"appropriated material, acknowledged as often as practicable; also to"
836,PREFACE.,"my friend, Mr. A. G. Wright, for invaluable help during the rather"
837,PREFACE.,monotonous task of hunting up and copying at the reading-room of the
838,PREFACE.,"British Museum; and to Mr. William Sharp, whose critical advice and"
839,PREFACE.,generous encouragement throughout have left a debt of gratitude beyond
840,PREFACE.,payment.
841,PREFACE.,
842,PREFACE.,"In a society paper, _The London_, a brilliant series of these poems"
843,PREFACE.,"appeared during 1877-8. After a selection was made for this volume, it"
844,PREFACE.,"was discovered that they were all by _one_ author, Mr. W. E. Henley,"
845,PREFACE.,"who most generously permitted the whole of those chosen to appear,"
846,PREFACE.,and to be for the first time publicly attributed to him. The poems
847,PREFACE.,"themselves need no apology, but in the face of so many from his pen,"
848,PREFACE.,it is only right to explain the reason for the inclusion of so large a
849,PREFACE.,number.
850,PREFACE.,
851,PREFACE.,From America Mr. Brander Matthews and Mr. Clinton Scollard have shown
852,PREFACE.,"sympathy with the collection, not only by permitting their works to"
853,PREFACE.,"be cited, but also by calling my attention to poems by authors almost"
854,PREFACE.,unknown in England; while all those writers who in the new world are
855,PREFACE.,"using the old shapes with a peculiar freshness and vigour, gave ready"
856,PREFACE.,assent to the demand.
857,PREFACE.,
858,PREFACE.,"To Messrs. Cassell & Co., for allowing poems that appeared in"
859,PREFACE.,_Cassell's Family Magazine_ (those by Miss Ada Louise Martin and Mr.
860,PREFACE.,"G. Weatherley); to Messrs. Longman, for liberty to quote freely from"
861,PREFACE.,the many graceful examples that appeared in _Longman's Magazine_; to
862,PREFACE.,"Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, & Co., for endorsing Mr. Andrew Lang's"
863,PREFACE.,permission to include specimens from _Rhymes à la Mode_ and _Ballades
864,PREFACE.,"in Blue China_, the utmost thanks are due for the courtesy shown;"
865,PREFACE.,"also to the proprietors of the _Century Magazine_, where so many of"
866,PREFACE.,the American poems (many since collected by the authors in their own
867,PREFACE.,volumes) first appeared; and to Messrs Harper for permission to use
868,PREFACE.,"Mr. Coleman's _Sestina_, and Mr. Graham R. Tomson's _Ballade of the"
869,PREFACE.,"Bourne_, which first appeared in their popular monthly. The poems that"
870,PREFACE.,are cited by the courtesy of Mr. John Payne appear respectively in
871,PREFACE.,"_Songs of Life and Death_ (W. H. Allen & Co.), _New Poems_ (ditto), and"
872,PREFACE.,"_Poems by François Villon_ (Reeves & Turner), now out of print."
873,PREFACE.,
874,PREFACE.,"Having named so many who have lent aid, it is but fair to exonerate"
875,PREFACE.,"them from any blame for errors that, no doubt, in spite of the utmost"
876,PREFACE.,"care, may have crept in. In view of a later edition, I should be"
877,PREFACE.,glad to be informed of any additional data of the use of the forms
878,PREFACE.,"in English verse, which, if quoted, would add to the value of the"
879,PREFACE.,"collection, or to have any erroneous statements corrected."
880,PREFACE.,
881,PREFACE.,Notwithstanding the many shortcomings of my own share in the production
882,PREFACE.,"of this volume, I cannot doubt but that the charm of the poems"
883,PREFACE.,"themselves will endear it to readers; and as a lover of the ""Gallic"
884,PREFACE.,"bonds,"" I venture to hope it may do some little towards their complete"
885,PREFACE.,naturalisation in our tongue.

907,CONSTRUCTION.,"In the limited space available, it is hardly possible to give more than"
908,CONSTRUCTION.,a very crude sketch of the origin of these forms; but some reference
909,CONSTRUCTION.,"to early Provençal literature is inevitable, since the nucleus of"
910,CONSTRUCTION.,not a few of them can be traced among the intricate rhyming of the
911,CONSTRUCTION.,Troubadours. Yet it would be beyond the purpose to go minutely into the
912,CONSTRUCTION.,"enticing history of that remarkable period, nor is it needful to raise"
913,CONSTRUCTION.,disputed questions regarding the origin of each particular fashion. The
914,CONSTRUCTION.,"number of books on Provençal subjects is great, the mere enumeration"
915,CONSTRUCTION.,of the names of those in the library of the British Museum would fill
916,CONSTRUCTION.,several pages. The language itself has a fascination which allures
917,CONSTRUCTION.,"many to disaster, for as Mr. Hueffer points out, it ""looks at first"
918,CONSTRUCTION.,sight so like the Latin and more familiar Romance languages that it
919,CONSTRUCTION.,"offers special temptations"" to guess at its meaning, with very doubtful"
920,CONSTRUCTION.,success.
921,CONSTRUCTION.,
922,CONSTRUCTION.,The term Provençal is usually applied to a dialect more correctly
923,CONSTRUCTION.,"known as ""the Langue d'Oc, which, with the Langue d'Oil, forms the two"
924,CONSTRUCTION.,divisions of the Romance language spoken in the country we now know as
925,CONSTRUCTION.,"France;"" but Mr. Saintsbury remarks that, strictly speaking, the Langue"
926,CONSTRUCTION.,"d'Oc should not be called ""French"" at all, since it is hardly more akin"
927,CONSTRUCTION.,"to the Langue d'Oil than it is to Spanish and Italian, and that those"
928,CONSTRUCTION.,"who spoke it applied the term ""French"" to northern speech, calling"
929,CONSTRUCTION.,"their own Limousin, or Provençal, or Auvergnat. The limits where it"
930,CONSTRUCTION.,prevailed extended far beyond Provence itself. Authorities differ
931,CONSTRUCTION.,with regard to the exact boundaries. It will suffice for the present
932,CONSTRUCTION.,"purpose to take those Mr. Hueffer adopts--namely, the district within a"
933,CONSTRUCTION.,boundary formed by a line drawn from the mouth of the Gironde to that
934,CONSTRUCTION.,"of the Saone, in the north, while the southern limit includes parts of"
935,CONSTRUCTION.,"Spain, such as Aragon, Valencia, Catalonia, and the Balearic Islands."
936,CONSTRUCTION.,
937,CONSTRUCTION.,"Herr Karl Bartsch, the eminent historian of Provençal literature,"
938,CONSTRUCTION.,"divides it into three periods:--the first, to the end of the eleventh"
939,CONSTRUCTION.,"century; the second, which is the one that marks the most flourishing"
940,CONSTRUCTION.,"time of the poetry of the Troubadours, extending over the twelfth and"
941,CONSTRUCTION.,thirteenth; and the third period--of its decadence--in the fourteenth
942,CONSTRUCTION.,and fifteenth centuries. To this may be added the attempt to revive
943,CONSTRUCTION.,"it in our own day, by the school of the so-called _Félibres_,"
944,CONSTRUCTION.,"including Mistral, Aubanel, Alphonse Daudet, and others, who have"
945,CONSTRUCTION.,"worked vigorously, and with no mean success, to produce a modern"
946,CONSTRUCTION.,"literature in the old dialect, worthy of its former dignity. In this"
947,CONSTRUCTION.,preface it is impossible to mention any part of the prose of this
948,CONSTRUCTION.,"marvellous literature, which sprang almost suddenly into a gigantic"
949,CONSTRUCTION.,"growth, that has been a fruitful theme for wonder and admiration ever"
950,CONSTRUCTION.,"since, and left its influence widely felt. The point that is to the"
951,CONSTRUCTION.,"purpose here, concerns the invention by the Provençal poets of many"
952,CONSTRUCTION.,"set forms of verse, some few of which are still written, but most"
953,CONSTRUCTION.,"so altered and renewed by later use, that their original character"
954,CONSTRUCTION.,is well-nigh obscured. The forms included in this book are often
955,CONSTRUCTION.,"erroneously attributed _en masse_ to the _jongleurs_ of Provence, yet"
956,CONSTRUCTION.,"few assumptions are less true. Altered by the Trouvères, the fifteenth"
957,CONSTRUCTION.,"century poets, the Ronsardists, and later writers, it is safer to"
958,CONSTRUCTION.,assign to the Troubadours only the germs which evolved gradually into
959,CONSTRUCTION.,their now matured forms. To linger over the extraordinary period is
960,CONSTRUCTION.,a temptation hard to dismiss; the very name still has a flavour of
961,CONSTRUCTION.,"romance, and brings a curious medley of images to the mind when it is"
962,CONSTRUCTION.,"heard, many perhaps as far from the actual Provençal Troubadour as"
963,CONSTRUCTION.,"_Nanki-Poo_ in the ""_Mikado_"" is from the wandering minstrel of the"
964,CONSTRUCTION.,"court of King Thibaut. Of the Troubadours who have come down to fame,"
965,CONSTRUCTION.,"four hundred and sixty are recorded by name, besides two hundred and"
966,CONSTRUCTION.,fifty-one pieces that have survived without evidence of their authors.
967,CONSTRUCTION.,"King Richard I. (our own Coeur de Lion), Guillem de Cabestanh, Peire"
968,CONSTRUCTION.,"Vidal, Bertran de Born, The Monk of Montaudon, and many others, have"
969,CONSTRUCTION.,biographical sketches of exceeding interest allotted to them in Mr.
970,CONSTRUCTION.,"Hueffer's ""The Troubadours."" A halo of romance has gathered round"
971,CONSTRUCTION.,"their names, and thrown a glamour over the record of their lives; to"
972,CONSTRUCTION.,read their history is to be transported to a region where all topics
973,CONSTRUCTION.,"but love and song are deemed unimportant trifles, unless the old"
974,CONSTRUCTION.,chroniclers are singularly untruthful in their statements. We know
975,CONSTRUCTION.,"now-a-days many a young poet's crushed life appears only in his verses,"
976,CONSTRUCTION.,and outside those he appears but an average Philistine to vulgar eyes.
977,CONSTRUCTION.,"Perhaps the ""land of the nightingale and rose"" was not so idyllic as"
978,CONSTRUCTION.,"its historians paint it; but with every deduction, there yet remains"
979,CONSTRUCTION.,"evidence of an exceptional importance attached to the arts, more"
980,CONSTRUCTION.,"especially to that of song. To those who wrote, or rather sang, witty"
981,CONSTRUCTION.,"impromptus (made often, we can but fancy, with much labour beforehand),"
982,CONSTRUCTION.,"or produced dainty conceits in elaborate rhymes and rhythms, when"
983,CONSTRUCTION.,"sound came perilously near triumphing over sense, a welcome was"
984,CONSTRUCTION.,"extended, as widespread and far more personal in its application than"
985,CONSTRUCTION.,even that accorded to our modern substitute for the troubadour--the
986,CONSTRUCTION.,"popular novelist. The doings of the Courts of Love, set down in sober"
987,CONSTRUCTION.,"chronicles, are hardly less fantastic than Mr. Gilbert's ingenious"
988,CONSTRUCTION.,operas. Matters of the most sentimental and amorous character were
989,CONSTRUCTION.,"debated in public, with all the earnestness of a question of state."
990,CONSTRUCTION.,That their poetry was singularly limited in its character there is
991,CONSTRUCTION.,"little doubt, but Mr. Hueffer declares that it had its serious side,"
992,CONSTRUCTION.,"often lost sight of, and that no small portion was devoted to stately"
993,CONSTRUCTION.,"and dignified subjects. Mr. Lowell, on the other hand, in an essay on"
994,CONSTRUCTION.,"Chaucer in _My Study Windows_, says--"
995,CONSTRUCTION.,
996,CONSTRUCTION.,"""Their poetry is purely lyric in its most narrow sense, that is,"
997,CONSTRUCTION.,the expression of personal and momentary moods. To the fancy of
998,CONSTRUCTION.,"the critics who take their cue from tradition, Provence is a"
999,CONSTRUCTION.,"morning sky of early summer, out of which innumerable larks rain a"
1000,CONSTRUCTION.,faint melody (the sweeter because rather half divined than heard
1001,CONSTRUCTION.,too distinctly) over an earth where the dew never dries and the
1002,CONSTRUCTION.,flowers never fade. But when we open Raynouard it is like opening
1003,CONSTRUCTION.,the door of an aviary. We are deafened and confused by a hundred
1004,CONSTRUCTION.,"minstrels singing the same song at once, and more than suspect the"
1005,CONSTRUCTION.,"flowers they welcome are made of French cambric, spangled with"
1006,CONSTRUCTION.,"dewdrops of prevaricating glass."""
1007,CONSTRUCTION.,
1008,CONSTRUCTION.,The forms in which the Provençal poets wrote were chiefly these:--The
1009,CONSTRUCTION.,"oldest was called _vers_, and consisted of octosyllabic lines arranged"
1010,CONSTRUCTION.,"in stanzas; from this grew the _canzo_, with interlaced rhymes--later"
1011,CONSTRUCTION.,"on with the distinctive feature still prominent in French, but"
1012,CONSTRUCTION.,"unknown in English poetry, the rhymes _masculine_ and _feminine_."
1013,CONSTRUCTION.,"The _canzo_ was used entirely for subjects of love and gallantry,"
1014,CONSTRUCTION.,"but the _sirvente_, composed of short stanzas, simply rhyming, and"
1015,CONSTRUCTION.,"corresponding one to the other, was employed for political and social"
1016,CONSTRUCTION.,"subjects, sometimes treated seriously, at others satirically. The"
1017,CONSTRUCTION.,_tenso_ was a curious trial of skill in impromptu versification. Two
1018,CONSTRUCTION.,antagonists met and agreed that the one should reply on the opposite
1019,CONSTRUCTION.,"side to any argument the first might select. The opening stanza,"
1020,CONSTRUCTION.,"chosen at will by the speaker, was imitated in the reply, both in"
1021,CONSTRUCTION.,"observance of its rhyme and rhythm, the same rhyme-sound being often"
1022,CONSTRUCTION.,kept throughout the whole poem. It must not be forgotten that the
1023,CONSTRUCTION.,"Langue d'Oc was singularly fertile in rhymes, so that the feat was less"
1024,CONSTRUCTION.,"arduous than it would be in other tongues. The _alba_, a farewell at"
1025,CONSTRUCTION.,"morning, and the _serena_, or evening song, the _pastorella_, devoted,"
1026,CONSTRUCTION.,"as its name implies, to pastoral subjects, appear to govern the themes"
1027,CONSTRUCTION.,"of the verses rather than the form. There is record, however, of the"
1028,CONSTRUCTION.,"_breu-doble_ (double short), invented by Guirant Riquier, a little"
1029,CONSTRUCTION.,"form with three rhymes, two of which are repeated twice in three"
1030,CONSTRUCTION.,"four-lined stanzas, and given once in a concluding couplet, while the"
1031,CONSTRUCTION.,third finished each quatrain. The _retroensa_ is noticeable for its
1032,CONSTRUCTION.,refrain of more than one line. The sonnet has ceased to be claimed
1033,CONSTRUCTION.,"as a Provençal invention, yet it must be noted, as at one time its"
1034,CONSTRUCTION.,"origin there was a favourite theory. The _ballade_, ""a song serving"
1035,CONSTRUCTION.,"to accompany the dance,"" must not be confused with the later ballade;"
1036,CONSTRUCTION.,"and lastly, the greatest in most respects, the _sestina_, which, as"
1037,CONSTRUCTION.,"it occurs among the poems noticed technically later on, need not be"
1038,CONSTRUCTION.,further mentioned here.
1039,CONSTRUCTION.,
1040,CONSTRUCTION.,"""The artificial verse-forms of Provence include some as peculiar and"
1041,CONSTRUCTION.,arbitrary as ever issued from the brain of Persian poet--verse-forms
1042,CONSTRUCTION.,"by the side of which the metrical glitter of _ballade_, _chant royal_,"
1043,CONSTRUCTION.,"_rondeau_, _rondel_, _triolet_, _virelai_ and _villanelle_ must pale,"""
1044,CONSTRUCTION.,"says a writer in the _Westminster Review_ (October 1878), and instances"
1045,CONSTRUCTION.,the _tenso_ and the _sestina_ in proof of his assertion. Mr. Hueffer
1046,CONSTRUCTION.,also treats the _chant royal_ as mere child's play beside the intricate
1047,CONSTRUCTION.,feats displayed by the Troubadours. The above short list shows many
1048,CONSTRUCTION.,examples of forms using the refrain and some other features preserved
1049,CONSTRUCTION.,in Northern poetry; but the debt owed by the North to the Troubadours
1050,CONSTRUCTION.,"is far less, according to later writers, than that assigned to"
1051,CONSTRUCTION.,"Provençal influence some few years ago. Mr. Saintsbury says that ""poems"
1052,CONSTRUCTION.,"called _rondeaux_ and _ballades_, of loose construction and undecided"
1053,CONSTRUCTION.,"form, began to make their appearance at the end of the twelfth and"
1054,CONSTRUCTION.,"beginning of the thirteenth century,"" but the forms as we know them"
1055,CONSTRUCTION.,"owe their present shape to their reformation in Northern France,"
1056,CONSTRUCTION.,culminating in the poems of Charles d'Orléans and François Villon.
1057,CONSTRUCTION.,"In this revival, the _lai_ and _pastourelle_ kept their Provençal"
1058,CONSTRUCTION.,"titles, but were made much more exact in form, and never attained the"
1059,CONSTRUCTION.,"widespread celebrity of the newer shapes, which are to all intents and"
1060,CONSTRUCTION.,"purposes the models for the forms in this volume, save the _sestina_,"
1061,CONSTRUCTION.,"which is practically an Italian, and the _pantoum_, an Eastern form."
1062,CONSTRUCTION.,
1063,CONSTRUCTION.,There is no space here to notice more than the names of a few of even
1064,CONSTRUCTION.,the most prominent of the poets who succeeded the Provençal singers
1065,CONSTRUCTION.,in their use of these forms. There are thousands of ballades in MSS.
1066,CONSTRUCTION.,"in the Royal French Library, by known and unknown writers. Eustache"
1067,CONSTRUCTION.,"Deschamps (1328-1415), a friend of Chaucer's, ""has left no less than"
1068,CONSTRUCTION.,"1175 ballades. Rondeaus, virelais, etc., also proceeded in great"
1069,CONSTRUCTION.,"numbers from his pen; also an important _Art of Poetry_, a treatise"
1070,CONSTRUCTION.,rendered at once necessary and popular by the fashion of artificial
1071,CONSTRUCTION.,"rhyming.""[1] Some of the earliest ballades and rondel-triolets bear the"
1072,CONSTRUCTION.,"name of Jehan Froissart (1337-1410), the chronicler. Messire Guy de"
1073,CONSTRUCTION.,"la Tremouille, according to Mr. Gosse, is supposed to have been the"
1074,CONSTRUCTION.,"first to devise the elaborate rules of construction of the ballade,"
1075,CONSTRUCTION.,which have been in force ever since. He was guard of the Oriflamme in
1076,CONSTRUCTION.,"1383, and died in 1398; but Deschamps is more often credited with the"
1077,CONSTRUCTION.,"honour. That he cultivated the form we know, besides writing an ""Art of"
1078,CONSTRUCTION.,"making Chansons, Ballades, Virelais, and Rondels,"" which is a valuable"
1079,CONSTRUCTION.,"relic of his time. Jehannot de Lescurel, ""of whom absolutely nothing"
1080,CONSTRUCTION.,"is known, has left sixteen ballades, fifteen rondeaus (not in regular"
1081,CONSTRUCTION.,"form), and other pieces, said to be 'of singular grace, lightness, and"
1082,CONSTRUCTION.,"elegance.'"""
1083,CONSTRUCTION.,
1084,CONSTRUCTION.,"[1] See Saintsbury's _Short History of French Literature_, p. 103."
1085,CONSTRUCTION.,
1086,CONSTRUCTION.,Guillaume de Machault (1284-1377) was also a voluminous writer. One of
1087,CONSTRUCTION.,"his poems, a _chanson balladée_, is printed in Mr. Saintsbury's _Short"
1088,CONSTRUCTION.,"History of French Literature_, which contains also a _Ballade_ by Alain"
1089,CONSTRUCTION.,"Chartier (1390-1458), the hero of the famous story of the kiss of Queen"
1090,CONSTRUCTION.,"Margaret of Scotland, and other specimens of this period, in a succinct"
1091,CONSTRUCTION.,"and trustworthy account of the growth of French poetry, surpassed by no"
1092,CONSTRUCTION.,book in our own language.
1093,CONSTRUCTION.,
1094,CONSTRUCTION.,"Charles d'Orléans (1391-1466), noticed among the English writers,"
1095,CONSTRUCTION.,is specially honoured as the master of the rondel; while François
1096,CONSTRUCTION.,"Villon (1431-1485) stands out as the ""prince of all ballade-makers."""
1097,CONSTRUCTION.,"For brief, but splendid sketches of these two, Mr. R. L. Stevenson's"
1098,CONSTRUCTION.,"_Familiar Studies of Men and Books_ should be consulted, while for"
1099,CONSTRUCTION.,more prosaic description there is no lack of data. Since the revival
1100,CONSTRUCTION.,"of interest in Villon, France has done tardy but unstinted honour to"
1101,CONSTRUCTION.,"her most famous poet, as it is the fashion just now to style him, but"
1102,CONSTRUCTION.,there is a doubt whether the praise given is not in danger of being
1103,CONSTRUCTION.,"exaggerated. Yet, making all allowances, there is vital humanity in his"
1104,CONSTRUCTION.,"wondrous writings, that now, after four hundred years, read as living"
1105,CONSTRUCTION.,"and modern in their presentation of life, as though they were by a"
1106,CONSTRUCTION.,"realist of our own day. In Villon, student, poet, housebreaker, we"
1107,CONSTRUCTION.,"find the forerunner of the Zola of to-day--one who, in so eminently an"
1108,CONSTRUCTION.,"artificial form as the ballade, cast aside all conventional restraints,"
1109,CONSTRUCTION.,and sang of what he saw and knew. It is much to be regretted that
1110,CONSTRUCTION.,space forbids more translations of his poems to be included in this
1111,CONSTRUCTION.,"collection. For those who wish to tackle him in his old, and by no"
1112,CONSTRUCTION.,"means easy, French, a good edition is published for a franc, in the"
1113,CONSTRUCTION.,_Collection Jannet-Picard (Paris)_. Mr. Payne has translated the whole
1114,CONSTRUCTION.,"of his authentic works into English in a volume, at present out of"
1115,CONSTRUCTION.,"print, which contains also a very graphic and full biography of this"
1116,CONSTRUCTION.,remarkable man. Space forbids insertion of the sketch of his life
1117,CONSTRUCTION.,"prepared for this chapter. Born in 1431, student 1448, B.A. in 1452,"
1118,CONSTRUCTION.,"writing his _Lesser Testament_ in 1446, his _Greater Testament_ in"
1119,CONSTRUCTION.,"1461; in those few years he contrived to win more fame, and, to speak"
1120,CONSTRUCTION.,"truly, more infamy, than a whole generation of lesser poets. He was"
1121,CONSTRUCTION.,condemned to die--he wrote his marvellous _Ballade of the Gibbet_ while
1122,CONSTRUCTION.,"lying under sentence of death--but escaped. Where he died is unknown,"
1123,CONSTRUCTION.,the date of his _Greater Testament_ being the last record of Master
1124,CONSTRUCTION.,François Villon of Paris.

1126,CONSTRUCTION.,In 1493 appeared _L'art et science de rhéthorique pour faire rigmes et
1127,CONSTRUCTION.,"ballades_, by Henry de Croï--an invaluable treatise on French Poetics."
1128,CONSTRUCTION.,"The works of Pierre Gringoire (1478-1544) must be named, if only for"
1129,CONSTRUCTION.,"the fact of De Banville's splendid ballade in his comedy ""Gringoire,"""
1130,CONSTRUCTION.,founded on an incident in the poet's life. By Mr. Lang's permission a
1131,CONSTRUCTION.,translation is quoted in the body of this volume. Mr. John Payne also
1132,CONSTRUCTION.,"englished it, in the _Dublin University Magazine_, 1879. The works of"
1133,CONSTRUCTION.,"Clement Marot (1497-1544) demand special note, since his _ballades_ and"
1134,CONSTRUCTION.,_chants royaux_ are now accepted as the ideal models for imitation.
1135,CONSTRUCTION.,
1136,CONSTRUCTION.,"In his _Art Poëtique_, 1555, Thomas Sibilet reviews many of the"
1137,CONSTRUCTION.,"former writers, and gives the rules of the poetry then in force."
1138,CONSTRUCTION.,Immediately after this date came another change; with the famous
1139,CONSTRUCTION.,"school of Ronsard (1524-1585) and the _Pléiade_, as they are styled,"
1140,CONSTRUCTION.,"one of whom, however, Du Bellay, was eager to abolish the _ballade_"
1141,CONSTRUCTION.,and _chant royal_ in favour of the _sonnet_. The members of this group
1142,CONSTRUCTION.,produced some notable work in strict forms. Among the Ronsardists we
1143,CONSTRUCTION.,"find Grévin the dramatist, who wrote some graceful poems which he"
1144,CONSTRUCTION.,called _Villanesques_--a modified form of the _Villanelle_--and Jean
1145,CONSTRUCTION.,"Passerat (1534-1602) who is specially noteworthy, since in his hand the"
1146,CONSTRUCTION.,"_Villanelle_ crystallised into its present shape, Joseph Boulmier, in"
1147,CONSTRUCTION.,"the last revival, making this form his special study, and writing all"
1148,CONSTRUCTION.,his verses after Passerat's model given elsewhere in this volume.
1149,CONSTRUCTION.,
1150,CONSTRUCTION.,The rondeau was revived in great splendour in the middle of the
1151,CONSTRUCTION.,seventeenth century. Foremost among the brilliant group is Voiture
1152,CONSTRUCTION.,"(1598-1648), the acknowledged master of this form. Only thirty of"
1153,CONSTRUCTION.,"his rondeaus are left, but each one of these is a masterpiece, and"
1154,CONSTRUCTION.,may be studied for all the subtle devices and dainty inventions that
1155,CONSTRUCTION.,the form has yet yielded. Benserade (1612-1691) and Sarrasin were
1156,CONSTRUCTION.,"also famous for rondeau-making, the former translating the whole of"
1157,CONSTRUCTION.,"Ovid's _Metamorphoses_ into rondeaus, which were sumptuously printed"
1158,CONSTRUCTION.,"at the King's Press at a cost of 10,000 francs. When Voiture died in"
1159,CONSTRUCTION.,"1648, it is curious to note that Sarrasin wrote a ""pompous funereal"
1160,CONSTRUCTION.,"poem--possibly the most funny serious elegy ever composed--in which,"
1161,CONSTRUCTION.,"among other strange mourners, he makes the 'poor little triolet,' all"
1162,CONSTRUCTION.,"in tears, trot by the side of the dead poet,"" who, according to Mr."
1163,CONSTRUCTION.,"Gosse, from whom the above paragraph is quoted, had never written one"
1164,CONSTRUCTION.,"in his life. Sarrasin also left a curious specimen of the _Glose_,"
1165,CONSTRUCTION.,"written on the famous Sonnet ""de IOB"" by Benserade. In 1649 Gérard de"
1166,CONSTRUCTION.,Saint Amant wrote a volume of sixty-four triolets. From the seventeenth
1167,CONSTRUCTION.,to the nineteenth century no important examples occur. About thirty
1168,CONSTRUCTION.,"years ago De Banville revived these old shapes, and initiated a"
1169,CONSTRUCTION.,"movement that Daudet, Glatigny, Boulmier, and a host of others have"
1170,CONSTRUCTION.,"helped forward, so that now modern French literature is flooded with"
1171,CONSTRUCTION.,"examples of the forms-the ballade, rondeau, and triolet being the most"
1172,CONSTRUCTION.,widely used.
1173,CONSTRUCTION.,
1174,CONSTRUCTION.,"Having imperfectly followed the growth of the forms in France, it"
1175,CONSTRUCTION.,will be interesting to give a few notes of the various attempts made
1176,CONSTRUCTION.,to acclimatise some in England. Although no effort previous to 1873
1177,CONSTRUCTION.,"warrants us in claiming an English pedigree for them, yet it is"
1178,CONSTRUCTION.,curious to see how often the attempt was made to write them in our own
1179,CONSTRUCTION.,"tongue. The sonnet gradually grew into use, until it became as little"
1180,CONSTRUCTION.,"an exotic as the potato, to employ an uncouth simile; the ballade and"
1181,CONSTRUCTION.,"rondeau--hardly more formal in their rules, and with susceptibilities"
1182,CONSTRUCTION.,of infinite grace and beauty--failed to be even residents amongst
1183,CONSTRUCTION.,"us, much less naturalised subjects, sharing the rights and duties of"
1184,CONSTRUCTION.,"citizens. Chaucer is believed to have used these forms, as in ""The"
1185,CONSTRUCTION.,"Legend of Good Women"" he says, speaking of himself--"
1186,CONSTRUCTION.,
1187,CONSTRUCTION.,"""Many a himpne for your holy daies"
1188,CONSTRUCTION.,"That highten balades, roundels, virelaies."""
1189,CONSTRUCTION.,
1190,CONSTRUCTION.,"His ""Balade de Vilage sauns Peynture,"" however, does not correspond"
1191,CONSTRUCTION.,with the accepted form. Mr. Gosse says that the Chaucer of 1651
1192,CONSTRUCTION.,"contains a number of poems attributed to himself and Lydgate ""which"
1193,CONSTRUCTION.,"are merely pieces in rhyme-royal, so arranged as to imitate the French"
1194,CONSTRUCTION.,"ballade: without its severity of form."""
1195,CONSTRUCTION.,

1233,III.,"court."" The thin oblong MS., on vellum, which contains them is still"
1234,III.,"extant in the Marquis of Stafford's library at Trentham, and in 1818 it"
1235,III.,was printed for the Roxburghe Club; but as the poems are unfortunately
1236,III.,"written in French, they do not assist in supporting a claim for the"
1237,III.,early use of the form in England. Professor Henry Morley has translated
1238,III.,"one for his _English Writers_; it follows the rhymes accurately, but"
1239,III.,"has a somewhat trite subject. A critic has well said of it, that the"
1240,III.,"poets of Gowers's day ""were not burdened with solving 'the riddle of"
1241,III.,the painful earth.' It may be that a good deal of their guileless
1242,III.,"delight in things fresh and young was feigned, but then so is much"
1243,III.,"of our more pretentious philosophy."" From its special interest it is"

1280,III.,"John Shirley, who lived about 1440, made a collection of _Ballades_,"
1281,III.,"_Roundels_, _Virelais_, and Tragedies, in MSS., which are still"
1282,III.,"extant in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. After noticing Gower, who"
1283,III.,"wrote ballades in French, Charles d'Orléans, who wrote rondels in"
1284,III.,"English, comes as another instance of the early use, but again as a"
1285,III.,"mere exception, since the accident which led both writers to adopt"
1286,III.,"exotic forms is outside the history of our native poetry, and cannot"
1287,III.,be brought forward to prove their early naturalisation. Of Charles
1288,III.,"d'Orléans much might be said worth saying, but there are so many"
1289,III.,"sources of information open, that here we need note only the poems"
1290,III.,written during his captivity. He is said to have been our prisoner for
1291,III.,"about twenty-five years, and during that time to have acquired a taste"
1292,III.,"for our language. The Abbé Sallier, who unearthed the manuscript of"
1293,III.,"his poems in the Royal Library at Paris during the last century, says"
1294,III.,"he wrote but two in English; but in the MS. at the British Museum,"
1295,III.,"the Rev. H. F. Cary, the translator of Dante, found three, quoted in"
1296,III.,"his _Early French Poets_ (Bohn, 1846). The editor of that volume, the"
1297,III.,"Rev. Henry Cary, son of the author, mentions in a footnote a large"
1298,III.,"collection among the Harleian MSS., attributed to Charles d'Orléans,"
1299,III.,but throws doubt on their being more than translations. Into this
1300,III.,question there is no space to enter. These are the three from Cary's
1301,III.,book:--
1302,III.,
1303,III.,"Go forth, my hert, with my lady;"
1304,III.,Loke that ye spar no bysines

1345,III.,
1346,III.,Spenser (1553-1599) is said (but I cannot trace the authority) to have
1347,III.,"used some of these forms. Again, Sir Philip Sidney's (1554-1586) famous"
1348,III.,"ditty, ""My true love hath my heart,"" recalls the rondel, but cannot"
1349,III.,claim to be one. Drummond of Hawthornden (1585-1649) has a fine sestina
1350,III.,"(too long for quotation), ""Sith gone is my delight and only pleasure."""
1351,III.,
1352,III.,"_The Trivial Poems, and Triolets_ of Patrick Carey deserve mention."
1353,III.,"This volume was unknown until the beginning of the present century,"
1354,III.,"although dated Warnefurd, 1651. The poems were brought into notice by"
1355,III.,"Sir Walter Scott, who obtained the MSS. from John Murray, and after"
1356,III.,"inserting a few in the _Edinburgh Annual Register_, 1810, published the"
1357,III.,whole for the first time in 1819. The following specimen is taken from
1358,III.,"Scott's reprint, p. 43:--"
1359,III.,
1360,III.,"Worldly designes, feares, hopes, farwell!"
1361,III.,Farwell all earthly joyes and cares!

1370,III.,"In the _Athenæum_, May 7, 1887, is a long article on Carey, signed C."
1371,III.,"F. S. Warner, M. A. Charles Cotton, the friend of Izaak Walton, wrote"
1372,III.,"a rondeau, ""a very ungallant example,"" cited in Dr. Guests' _History"
1373,III.,"of English Rhythms_. There is also one unquotable, by reason of its"
1374,III.,"subject, among the correspondence of Alexander Pope (1688-1744), and"
1375,III.,"in the _Rolliad_, 1784, a volume of satires in prose and verse, that"
1376,III.,"enjoyed a great popularity for a time, there is a set of five rondeaus,"
1377,III.,"written in pure form after the Voiture model. They satirise North,"
1378,III.,"Eden, Pitt, and Dorset, and are perfect in construction, and vigorous"
1379,III.,in their ridicule. The popularity of these effusions led to many
1380,III.,"imitations in the periodical prints at the beginning of this century,"
1381,III.,"few, however, of sufficient merit to be worth reviving. By the courtesy"
1382,III.,"of Mr. Austin Dobson, the owner, I am able to extract a specimen from a"
1383,III.,"scarce and little-known book, entitled _Rondeaulx; translated from the"
1384,III.,"Black Letter French Edition of 1527, by J. R. Best, Esq._;--"

1393,III.,"The dedication to Robert Studley Vidal, Esq., is dated 1838. The first"
1394,III.,"poem is preceded by a quaint apology, that unfortunately is too long"
1395,III.,"to quote, but the rondeau itself, if its rhythm is faulty and its"
1396,III.,"language ungraceful, shows that the original had sterling advice to"
1397,III.,"offer, and that the translator was not ignorant of the true rules of"
1398,III.,the form.

1422,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the _Chandos Classics_, there is one ballade given (with its original"
1423,UNG BON RONDEAU,"French, both without envoy); but although noting the peculiarity that"
1424,UNG BON RONDEAU,"each stanza has the same terminations, Mr. Oxenford has not kept it"
1425,UNG BON RONDEAU,"in his translation, nor has Miss Costello, in a numerous collection"
1426,UNG BON RONDEAU,"of ballades, rondels, lais, and other forms, once paraphrased them"
1427,UNG BON RONDEAU,"accurately, usually varying even the refrain; nor can I see, in her"
1428,UNG BON RONDEAU,"voluminous notes, that she draws attention to this important feature,"
1429,UNG BON RONDEAU,although she gives the particulars of the eccentricities of rhyming
1430,UNG BON RONDEAU,"known as _Fraternisée, Brisée_, and the like, and condemns their"
1431,UNG BON RONDEAU,triviality rather strongly. In the edition before me no date is given;
1432,UNG BON RONDEAU,the authoress died in 1870. The oft-quoted Rondeau by Leigh Hunt is so
1433,UNG BON RONDEAU,beautiful in itself that all its shortcomings in the matter of form
1434,UNG BON RONDEAU,"may be readily pardoned, and if--but the saving clause is great--others"
1435,UNG BON RONDEAU,"as beautiful could be built on the same shape, a ""Leigh Hunt"" variation"
1436,UNG BON RONDEAU,would be a welcome addition to the forms in English; but it is no
1437,UNG BON RONDEAU,"_rondeau_, and has not the faintest claim to be so styled. Probably it"
1438,UNG BON RONDEAU,"is familiar to all readers, but in case even one should not know it, it"

1456,UNG BON RONDEAU,How far that volume led the way to the modern employment of these forms

1459,UNG BON RONDEAU,"Mr. W. E. Henley, Mr. Payne, and one or two other writers, were each,"
1460,UNG BON RONDEAU,"unknown to the rest, trying the new measures. In the words of one of"

1462,UNG BON RONDEAU,"as we now see, the new movement began simultaneously to adapt its rules"
1463,UNG BON RONDEAU,to English conditions. To Mr. Bridges belongs the honour of printing

1465,UNG BON RONDEAU,"looked upon as the apostle for the naturalisation of the exotic forms,"
1466,UNG BON RONDEAU,"for which he had no peculiar sympathy, and after his _Poems_, 1873,"
1467,UNG BON RONDEAU,"ceased to use. So little were his experiments appreciated, that their"
1468,UNG BON RONDEAU,"presence in his volume was considered prejudicial to its success,"
1469,UNG BON RONDEAU,"by competent authorities of the day, who little foresaw the rapid"
1470,UNG BON RONDEAU,growth that would so soon spring up. To Mr. Austin Dobson is assigned
1471,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the first _ballade_, ""The Prodigals;"" to Mr. Edmund Gosse the first"
1472,UNG BON RONDEAU,_villanelle_ and _chant royal_; and to Mr. W. E. Henley the first
1473,UNG BON RONDEAU,"_double ballade_, and a few other variations. But it is most likely"
1474,UNG BON RONDEAU,that the priority of some of these was due to the mere accident of
1475,UNG BON RONDEAU,"publication, and that it is more near the truth to regard the whole"
1476,UNG BON RONDEAU,"as a contemporaneous movement toward French rhythms, thought out and"
1477,UNG BON RONDEAU,"experimented upon by many writers, ignorant of the fact that they were"
1478,UNG BON RONDEAU,"not alone in the study, and that others were working upon the same"
1479,UNG BON RONDEAU,lines. One of the first who made trial of these French rhythms has (I
1480,UNG BON RONDEAU,believe) never published any; yet examples of their use by the author
1481,UNG BON RONDEAU,of _A Child's Garden of Verse_ would have added greatly to the interest
1482,UNG BON RONDEAU,"of this collection, but the author has willed that they should remain"
1483,UNG BON RONDEAU,"unquoted, so I can only regret their absence."
1484,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1485,UNG BON RONDEAU,"From 1873 to 1877 a fair number had appeared, but these were produced"
1486,UNG BON RONDEAU,"almost entirely by the writers already named. From 1877, however, the"
1487,UNG BON RONDEAU,number of those who made them increased rapidly. In that year Mr.
1488,UNG BON RONDEAU,"Dobson's _Proverbs in Porcelain_ was published, containing a series of"
1489,UNG BON RONDEAU,"these forms, which, as internal evidence of much subsequent work shows,"
1490,UNG BON RONDEAU,have been accepted as typical models to be followed in their English
1491,UNG BON RONDEAU,"use. The series in _The London_ noticed elsewhere, during this year and"
1492,UNG BON RONDEAU,"1878, also increased their popularity, while the later English use may"
1493,UNG BON RONDEAU,be traced to some extent by the examples here collected. In America
1494,UNG BON RONDEAU,about the same time the new fashion in versemaking was taken up very
1495,UNG BON RONDEAU,"warmly, and to the present day the Americans have shown themselves more"
1496,UNG BON RONDEAU,cordial towards the Gallic measures than even our own countrymen. In
1497,UNG BON RONDEAU,the popular periodicals of the United States there are more specimens
1498,UNG BON RONDEAU,"than in our English magazines, and the appearance of so many examples"
1499,UNG BON RONDEAU,in this book shows that the American poets have caught a great deal of
1500,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the peculiar quality, hard to define but easy to recognise, which the"
1501,UNG BON RONDEAU,"forms demand. Then came Mr. W. Davenport Adams's _Latter Day Lyrics_,"
1502,UNG BON RONDEAU,"with a section devoted to these forms, and ""A Note on Some Foreign"
1503,UNG BON RONDEAU,"Forms of Verse,"" by Mr. Dobson. Since then the poems written in these"
1504,UNG BON RONDEAU,"styles have been increasing in number, until the idea of collecting"
1505,UNG BON RONDEAU,"them in one volume, long in my mind, was favourably entertained by Mr."
1506,UNG BON RONDEAU,"William Sharp, the general editor of the series in which this book"
1507,UNG BON RONDEAU,appears.
1508,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1509,UNG BON RONDEAU,The taste for these _tours de force_ in the art of versemaking is
1510,UNG BON RONDEAU,no doubt an acquired one; yet to quote the first attempt to produce
1511,UNG BON RONDEAU,a lyric with a repeated burden would take one back to the earliest
1512,UNG BON RONDEAU,civilisation. The use of the refrain and conventional arrangement of
1513,UNG BON RONDEAU,rhyme in these forms differs as widely from the burdens of the old
1514,UNG BON RONDEAU,"examples, as the purely conventional design of Greek art from the"
1515,UNG BON RONDEAU,savage patterns of its ancestral stock. Whether the first refrains
1516,UNG BON RONDEAU,"were used for decorative effect only, or to give the singer time to"
1517,UNG BON RONDEAU,"recollect or to improvise the next verse, it matters little, since"
1518,UNG BON RONDEAU,the once mere adjunct was made in later French use an integral and
1519,UNG BON RONDEAU,vital part of the verse. The charm of these strictly written verses
1520,UNG BON RONDEAU,is undoubtedly increased by some knowledge of their technical rules.
1521,UNG BON RONDEAU,"As a subtle harmony of colours may reveal, to those who can grasp"
1522,UNG BON RONDEAU,"it, a miracle of skill and science, while it is no more nor less"
1523,UNG BON RONDEAU,"than ""a pretty picture"" to others--or polyphonic harmony, with all"
1524,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the resources of the science of music, may be employed to enrich a"
1525,UNG BON RONDEAU,"clear popular melody, to which the unmusical can yet nod their heads"
1526,UNG BON RONDEAU,and fancy they understand it all; so a ballade or rondeau may be so
1527,UNG BON RONDEAU,"deftly wrought, with an infinity of care and grace, that those who"
1528,UNG BON RONDEAU,read it simply as a dainty poem never suspect the stern laws ordering
1529,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the apparent spontaneity of the whole. To approach ideal perfection,"
1530,UNG BON RONDEAU,nothing less than implicit obedience to all the rules is the first
1531,UNG BON RONDEAU,element of success; but the task is by no means finished there. Every
1532,UNG BON RONDEAU,"quality that poetry demands, whether clearness of thought, elegance of"
1533,UNG BON RONDEAU,"expression, harmonious sound, or faultless rhythm, is needed as much"
1534,UNG BON RONDEAU,"in these shapes as in unfettered verse, and not until all those are"
1535,UNG BON RONDEAU,contributed comes the final test of the poem itself; whether it utters
1536,UNG BON RONDEAU,"thoughts worth uttering, or suggests ideas worth recalling. It may be"
1537,UNG BON RONDEAU,"said, without fear of exaggeration, that all the qualities required to"
1538,UNG BON RONDEAU,"form a perfect lyric in poetry are equally needful here, _plus_ a great"
1539,UNG BON RONDEAU,many special ones the forms themselves demand. To the students of any
1540,UNG BON RONDEAU,art there is always a peculiar charm when the highest difficulties are
1541,UNG BON RONDEAU,"surmounted with such ease, that the consummate art is hidden to all"
1542,UNG BON RONDEAU,who know not the magic password to unveil it. But for those who have
1543,UNG BON RONDEAU,"no special knowledge of poetry, it is pertinent to inquire what good"
1544,UNG BON RONDEAU,"these ingenious _tours de force_ achieve, and why the poem could not"
1545,UNG BON RONDEAU,please as well if it was written in ordinary verse? This is hard to
1546,UNG BON RONDEAU,"answer; but the fact remains that in every phase of art, whether music,"
1547,UNG BON RONDEAU,"picture, or poem, such technical achievements have invariably found"
1548,UNG BON RONDEAU,admirers in any period of advanced civilisation. It has been said that
1549,UNG BON RONDEAU,these forms display no higher aim than the verses printed to resemble
1550,UNG BON RONDEAU,"an hour-glass or altar, in some of our early poets; but such an"
1551,UNG BON RONDEAU,accusation is hardly worthy of serious reply. If the sonnet in Italian
1552,UNG BON RONDEAU,"form has gained world-wide fame, the principle of fixed form is at once"
1553,UNG BON RONDEAU,"shown to be acceptable to the majority of scholars, and it becomes"
1554,UNG BON RONDEAU,only a question of degree whether these rondeaus and ballades gain so
1555,UNG BON RONDEAU,prominent a place. It is hardly fair to expect to find among these
1556,UNG BON RONDEAU,"forms a lyric that has caught the ear of the public, and won its way"
1557,UNG BON RONDEAU,"to the hearts of everyone; fifteen years of use is all they may claim,"
1558,UNG BON RONDEAU,"and compared with the lyric poetry guileless of bonds, during the same"
1559,UNG BON RONDEAU,"period, they at least hold their own. It must also be remembered that"
1560,UNG BON RONDEAU,"they were adopted by the younger men, who won no small amount of their"
1561,UNG BON RONDEAU,present fame by these pretty devices.
1562,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1563,UNG BON RONDEAU,ON THE RULES OF THE VARIOUS FORMS.--There are several general laws
1564,UNG BON RONDEAU,governing these fixed metrical forms that must be insisted on at
1565,UNG BON RONDEAU,the outset. The rule of the limited number of rhymes holds good of
1566,UNG BON RONDEAU,nearly all. One feature prominent in the French rules is impossible in
1567,UNG BON RONDEAU,"English, as the difference between the rhyme masculine on words that"
1568,UNG BON RONDEAU,"have not the _e_ mute for their final letter, and the rhyme feminine"
1569,UNG BON RONDEAU,"on words that possess the _e_ mute, is unknown to us; but side by"
1570,UNG BON RONDEAU,"side with the release from one binding law in French verse, a new one"
1571,UNG BON RONDEAU,"is imposed. In that language, words of exactly similar _sound_ and"
1572,UNG BON RONDEAU,"_spelling_ may be used to rhyme together, provided the meaning of the"
1573,UNG BON RONDEAU,words is distinct--such license the most doggerel bard would reject in
1574,UNG BON RONDEAU,"English--in spite of the precedent Milton offers, having ""Ruth"" and"
1575,UNG BON RONDEAU,"""ruth"" in one of his sonnets. Purists forbid in our tongue the use of"
1576,UNG BON RONDEAU,"words of distinct spelling, but identical sound, as ""sail"" and ""sale,"""
1577,UNG BON RONDEAU,"""bear"" and ""bare;"" nor would they allow words closely allied, as"
1578,UNG BON RONDEAU,"""claim,"" ""disclaim,"" ""reclaim,"" to be employed, the strict rule being,"
1579,UNG BON RONDEAU,_that no syllable once used as a rhyme can be used again for that
1580,UNG BON RONDEAU,"purpose throughout the poem, not even if it be spelt differently while"
1581,UNG BON RONDEAU,keeping the same sound; nor if the whole word is altered by a prefix;
1582,UNG BON RONDEAU,the syllable that rhymes must always be a new one both in sense and
1583,UNG BON RONDEAU,sound_. It is this feature of the many rhymes to be found on a limited
1584,UNG BON RONDEAU,root-sound that proves the initial difficulty in these shapes.
1585,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1586,UNG BON RONDEAU,If the above rule is thought too strict--and it must be owned very
1587,UNG BON RONDEAU,few writers acknowledge it to the extent of excluding such words as
1588,UNG BON RONDEAU,"""claim, acclaim, prove, reprove,"" etc.--at least such words should"
1589,UNG BON RONDEAU,"be kept as far apart as possible, not used in the same stanza, if it"
1590,UNG BON RONDEAU,"can be avoided, and never to rhyme with one another. Next in order,"
1591,UNG BON RONDEAU,"but of equal, perhaps primary importance, is the use of the refrain."
1592,UNG BON RONDEAU,This recurrent phrase is common in many languages; but the way these
1593,UNG BON RONDEAU,"ballades, rondeaus, and other shapes employ it, differs from all"
1594,UNG BON RONDEAU,others. In most old ballads and folk-songs the refrain comes as a
1595,UNG BON RONDEAU,"mere jingle, or, at best, an interlude, not reflecting the idea of"
1596,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the verse it closes, nor varying its sense in spite of retaining its"
1597,UNG BON RONDEAU,"sound, as it does in a perfect example of these forms. An ordinary"
1598,UNG BON RONDEAU,refrain in other poetry is usually kept to one note resounding through
1599,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the whole poem, much as the drone-bass in ""pifferari"" or ""musette"""
1600,UNG BON RONDEAU,music is kept going throughout. In music there is another form of
1601,UNG BON RONDEAU,"bass always kept continuous--the ground-bass, on which Handel and"
1602,UNG BON RONDEAU,Bach built some mighty choruses; but in this the repeated sequence of
1603,UNG BON RONDEAU,"notes in the phrase, although they occur again and again unaltered,"
1604,UNG BON RONDEAU,"have the superstructure welded into them, one splendid harmony--not,"
1605,UNG BON RONDEAU,"as in the other, a melody merely floating over the accompaniment of"
1606,UNG BON RONDEAU,the one note or chord of the drone bass. It may be a somewhat forced
1607,UNG BON RONDEAU,"parallel, but in the instance quoted, and the fugue, canon, and other"
1608,UNG BON RONDEAU,"contrapuntal laws of classical music, there is much in common with"
1609,UNG BON RONDEAU,these laws of strict metrical verse. The enormous use of set forms
1610,UNG BON RONDEAU,in the masterpieces of tone-art may be a happy augury to the future
1611,UNG BON RONDEAU,that yet awaits them in word-art. It may be said that at present the
1612,UNG BON RONDEAU,poems dare claim no such success as the contrapuntal devices in music
1613,UNG BON RONDEAU,"can show, where the greatest works employ such devices frequently;"
1614,UNG BON RONDEAU,yet the leap from the simple forms of counterpoint to the works of
1615,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the mighty John Sebastian took but comparatively few years, although"
1616,UNG BON RONDEAU,the distance was so great. But fanciful parallels of this sort are
1617,UNG BON RONDEAU,"rarely satisfactory to any, except their maker, and need not be dwelt"
1618,UNG BON RONDEAU,on here. The refrain in each case is noticed more especially among the
1619,UNG BON RONDEAU,"laws of each form, but with regard to all the forms it is necessary to"
1620,UNG BON RONDEAU,insist on the importance of introducing it unaltered in sound on each
1621,UNG BON RONDEAU,"recurrence; it is sometimes changed by using, say, ""and"" for ""but,"" or"
1622,UNG BON RONDEAU,"""then"" for ""if;"" but, without condemning any who take this license, it"
1623,UNG BON RONDEAU,"is better to avoid it. Still, any change of meaning that be obtained by"
1624,UNG BON RONDEAU,"alteration of punctuation, accent, or even of spelling, provided the"
1625,UNG BON RONDEAU,"sound is unchanged, is not merely allowable but desirable, in lighter"
1626,UNG BON RONDEAU,verse especially. Without recommending the use of the pun pure and
1627,UNG BON RONDEAU,"simple, where its easy vulgarity would quickly be fatal to the dainty"
1628,UNG BON RONDEAU,"conceits that mark the best humorous verse in these forms, yet any"
1629,UNG BON RONDEAU,"pretty play upon words, or a sentence with new meaning read into it by"
1630,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the context, is more than permissible, being present in the best models"
1631,UNG BON RONDEAU,of the Voiture rondeau and many triolets and ballades. This applies
1632,UNG BON RONDEAU,"chiefly to poems of the class called _Vers de Société_, for want of an"
1633,UNG BON RONDEAU,English synonym. The comic papers of our own country show no use of the
1634,UNG BON RONDEAU,"form quite so fine in burlesque treatment as some of the American ones,"
1635,UNG BON RONDEAU,"notably the chant royal, _Mrs. Jones_, by Mr. H. C. Bunner; in the"
1636,UNG BON RONDEAU,burlesque examples printed in this book it will be seen that the forms
1637,UNG BON RONDEAU,"can be made to give added zest to satire or humour, beside imparting a"
1638,UNG BON RONDEAU,"certain scholarly finish, that itself raises them from the terribly"
1639,UNG BON RONDEAU,dead level of much of our so-called comic poetry. A few shapes yet
1640,UNG BON RONDEAU,await presentation in English dress. I have not succeeded in finding
1641,UNG BON RONDEAU,"specimens of the _glose_ or the _virelai_ (rhythme d'Alain Chartier),"
1642,UNG BON RONDEAU,"while the example of the _virelai_ (_nouveau_), Mr. Dobson's ""July,"""
1643,UNG BON RONDEAU,is the only one brought to light. The _lai_ and the _rondelet_ are
1644,UNG BON RONDEAU,"also very little used, so that anyone interested in these old measures"
1645,UNG BON RONDEAU,will yet find plenty of unhackneyed forms for experimenting upon. It
1646,UNG BON RONDEAU,"is curious that the sonnet, no less exacting in its technical rules,"
1647,UNG BON RONDEAU,"and far more imperious in the treatment it demands, finds so many eager"
1648,UNG BON RONDEAU,"followers, for with its wealth of literature, the chance of attaining"
1649,UNG BON RONDEAU,"to the second rank even, among such splendid poems, requires a high"
1650,UNG BON RONDEAU,"amount of talent, if not absolute genius. In the rondeau, or ballade,"
1651,UNG BON RONDEAU,many writers who are ignored in the ampler crowd of sonnet-makers might
1652,UNG BON RONDEAU,"find pleasing forms, not merely to display true poetic thoughts (if"
1653,UNG BON RONDEAU,"they have the power to do so), but verse that has in its shape some air"
1654,UNG BON RONDEAU,"of novelty still, and would sound less like the faint re-echoes of a"
1655,UNG BON RONDEAU,"stronger song, the frequent effect of many a modern sonnet."
1656,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1657,UNG BON RONDEAU,These few prefatory lines may well close with De Banville's own words
1658,UNG BON RONDEAU,"(in Mr. Lang's English)--""This cluster of forms is one of our most"
1659,UNG BON RONDEAU,"precious treasures, for each of them forms a rhythmic whole, complete"
1660,UNG BON RONDEAU,"and perfect, while at the same time they all possess the fresh and"
1661,UNG BON RONDEAU,"unconscious grace which marks the production of primitive times."" As"
1662,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the translator adds, ""There is some truth in this criticism, for it is"
1663,UNG BON RONDEAU,a mark of man's early ingenuity in many arts to seek complexity (where
1664,UNG BON RONDEAU,"you would expect simplicity), and yet to lend to that complexity an"
1665,UNG BON RONDEAU,infantine naturalness. One can see this phenomenon in early decorative
1666,UNG BON RONDEAU,"art, and in early law and custom, and even in the complicated"
1667,UNG BON RONDEAU,"structure of primitive languages. Now, just as early and even savage"
1668,UNG BON RONDEAU,"races are our masters in the decorative use of colour and of carving,"
1669,UNG BON RONDEAU,so the nameless mastersingers of ancient France may be our teachers in
1670,UNG BON RONDEAU,"decorative poetry--the poetry some call _vers de société_."""
1671,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1672,UNG BON RONDEAU,"In analysing the structure of these forms, it would be, no doubt,"
1673,UNG BON RONDEAU,"possible for a master to present them in English, as terse and"
1674,UNG BON RONDEAU,epigrammatic as the French of de Banville or de Gramont. But there
1675,UNG BON RONDEAU,would be a danger in so doing. A famous prelate is said to have
1676,UNG BON RONDEAU,"apologised for a long letter, on the ground that he had not time to"
1677,UNG BON RONDEAU,"write a short one: this anecdote may be paraphrased here, for it often"
1678,UNG BON RONDEAU,"happens that many have time to run through a discursive, gossipy"
1679,UNG BON RONDEAU,"description, when they could not devote the attention needful to"
1680,UNG BON RONDEAU,"_read_ a short one. If every word is carefully chosen, and used in an"
1681,UNG BON RONDEAU,"exact way to convey as much as possible, it requires no less careful"
1682,UNG BON RONDEAU,"reading;--as in some of our Science Primers, where the material for"
1683,UNG BON RONDEAU,an ordinary chapter is condensed and reduced to the crystal of a
1684,UNG BON RONDEAU,"single sentence, that demands almost equal exactness in obtaining"
1685,UNG BON RONDEAU,"its solution, if one would absorb all the learning compressed in so"
1686,UNG BON RONDEAU,small a compass. This excuse may serve in lieu of a better for the
1687,UNG BON RONDEAU,somewhat prolix method in which these rules are presented. Let no one
1688,UNG BON RONDEAU,imagine that the most perfect knowledge of the laws of these forms is
1689,UNG BON RONDEAU,enough to start him in writing poetry; for such rules are but what the
1690,UNG BON RONDEAU,fundamental rules of arithmetic are to astronomers--all important as
1691,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the basis, but powerless, without genius and science, to discover new"
1692,UNG BON RONDEAU,"worlds, or formulate an hypothesis for the existence of known ones."
1693,UNG BON RONDEAU,If such books as those the present chapter follows are looked upon as
1694,UNG BON RONDEAU,"handbooks to making _poetry_, that one stupendous flight of imagination"
1695,UNG BON RONDEAU,is probably the only one its author is fated to achieve.
1696,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1697,UNG BON RONDEAU,THE BALLADE.--In the alphabetical sequence adopted in the arrangement
1698,UNG BON RONDEAU,"of this volume, the _Ballade_ happily comes first. This is as it"
1699,UNG BON RONDEAU,"should be, since no other of these forms has been more frequently"
1700,UNG BON RONDEAU,"used in English, nor, it may be, is any other so capable of variety,"
1701,UNG BON RONDEAU,since among its successful examples many different treatments will be
1702,UNG BON RONDEAU,"found. This form adapts itself to its subject, and may be sonorous or"
1703,UNG BON RONDEAU,"stately, playful or easy, at the will of its writer, as, in capable"
1704,UNG BON RONDEAU,"hands, it can strike any note in the gamut of passions, from religious"
1705,UNG BON RONDEAU,"exaltation or fierce grim satire, to actual pathos, or, if needful,"
1706,UNG BON RONDEAU,pure burlesque. It is possible the _Ballade_ will never be written so
1707,UNG BON RONDEAU,"strictly to one model as the sonnet, but that many variations--to be"
1708,UNG BON RONDEAU,noticed presently--will each find admirers; but the existing examples
1709,UNG BON RONDEAU,"warrant a belief that the shape will continue in our poetry, for it is"
1710,UNG BON RONDEAU,"impossible, in face of many hundred examples, to style it an exotic at"
1711,UNG BON RONDEAU,the present day.
1712,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1713,UNG BON RONDEAU,"The construction of the _Ballade_, although not less stern in insisting"
1714,UNG BON RONDEAU,"on the introduction of a refrain than many of the other shapes, uses"
1715,UNG BON RONDEAU,"it at wider intervals, and so escapes the besetting danger of such"
1716,UNG BON RONDEAU,"forms as the _villanelle_ or _triolet_, where its constant recurrence"
1717,UNG BON RONDEAU,"may easily become as senseless as the ""with a fal, la, la"" of the"
1718,UNG BON RONDEAU,"old madrigal writers, unless it be very skilfully brought in. Again,"
1719,UNG BON RONDEAU,"its length, generally of twenty-eight or thirty-five lines, with the"
1720,UNG BON RONDEAU,"refrain in either case appearing but four times, allows room to display"
1721,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the subject, and yet forbids the diffuseness of many ordinary lyrics,"
1722,UNG BON RONDEAU,where one fancies a happy rhyme-sound is often responsible for the
1723,UNG BON RONDEAU,"intrusion of an additional couplet or quatrain, that weakens the whole"
1724,UNG BON RONDEAU,"poem. Its length, moreover, strictly within hard and fast limits though"
1725,UNG BON RONDEAU,"it be, is not so cramped as the fourteen lines of the true sonnet,"
1726,UNG BON RONDEAU,nor has tradition fixed the style of treatment of the central idea.
1727,UNG BON RONDEAU,"The narrative ballade is perfectly legitimate, provided the writer"
1728,UNG BON RONDEAU,has sufficient power to overcome the extreme difficulty it presents.
1729,UNG BON RONDEAU,"It is often urged that the unalterable sequence of rhymes, which must"
1730,UNG BON RONDEAU,"be found after the set of three or five are once chosen, proves a"
1731,UNG BON RONDEAU,hindrance to the imagination of the poet who uses it. M. Lemâitre has
1732,UNG BON RONDEAU,"answered this objection very aptly. He says--""The poet who begins a"
1733,UNG BON RONDEAU,"ballade does not know very exactly what he will put into it. The rhyme,"
1734,UNG BON RONDEAU,"and nothing but the rhyme, will whisper things unexpected and charming,"
1735,UNG BON RONDEAU,"things he would never have thought of but for her, things with strange"
1736,UNG BON RONDEAU,"and remote relations to each other, all united in the disorder of a"
1737,UNG BON RONDEAU,"dream. Nothing, indeed, is richer in suggestion than the strict laws of"
1738,UNG BON RONDEAU,"these difficult pieces; they force the fancy to wander afield, hunting"
1739,UNG BON RONDEAU,high and low; and while she seeks through all the world the foot that
1740,UNG BON RONDEAU,"can wear Cinderella's slipper, she makes delightful discoveries by the"
1741,UNG BON RONDEAU,"way.""[6]"
1742,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1743,UNG BON RONDEAU,"[6] Mr. Andrew Lang, _Longman's Magazine_, April 1887."
1744,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1745,UNG BON RONDEAU,"The BALLADE, in its normal type, consists of three stanzas of eight"
1746,UNG BON RONDEAU,"lines, followed by a verse of four lines, known as the envoy, or three"
1747,UNG BON RONDEAU,"verses of ten lines, with envoy of five, each of the stanzas and the"
1748,UNG BON RONDEAU,envoy closing with the refrain. The most important rules for the
1749,UNG BON RONDEAU,"ballade may be put briefly:--_First_, The same set of rhymes in the"
1750,UNG BON RONDEAU,same order they occupy in the first stanza must repeat throughout the
1751,UNG BON RONDEAU,"whole of its verses. _Secondly_, No word once used as a rhyme must be"
1752,UNG BON RONDEAU,"used again for that purpose in the whole length of the poem. _Thirdly_,"
1753,UNG BON RONDEAU,Each stanza and the envoy must close with the refrain; the envoy
1754,UNG BON RONDEAU,"always taking the same rhymes as the last half of the preceding verse,"
1755,UNG BON RONDEAU,"in the same order. For the eight-lined ballade, but three rhymes are"
1756,UNG BON RONDEAU,"allowable. In ordinary rhyme formula the sequence of these is A, B, A,"
1757,UNG BON RONDEAU,"B, B, C, B, C, for each of the three verses, and B, C, B, C, for the"
1758,UNG BON RONDEAU,envoy. The importance of the refrain must now be noticed. Old writers
1759,UNG BON RONDEAU,and purists of our own time insist that the length of the refrain
1760,UNG BON RONDEAU,"should govern not only the length of each line, but the number of the"
1761,UNG BON RONDEAU,"lines; in other words, that a refrain of eight syllables involves the"
1762,UNG BON RONDEAU,"choice of an eight-lined stanza, while the refrain of ten syllables"
1763,UNG BON RONDEAU,demands a ten-lined verse. This is the strict rule of the ballade as
1764,UNG BON RONDEAU,"written by Clement Marot, and by some modern writers; but it must be"
1765,UNG BON RONDEAU,"clearly understood that it is only the rule for the ideally pure form,"
1766,UNG BON RONDEAU,and that variations in this respect are perfectly allowable. Now the
1767,UNG BON RONDEAU,"importance of the refrain in one aspect is given, a still more vital"
1768,UNG BON RONDEAU,"point must be named--namely, that the sense of the refrain must be"
1769,UNG BON RONDEAU,"supreme throughout the ballade, the culminating line of each stanza"
1770,UNG BON RONDEAU,always brought in without effort as the natural close of the verse.
1771,UNG BON RONDEAU,"In the verses a special feature must not be overlooked, namely, that"
1772,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the stanza (of eight or ten lines, as the case may be) should carry"
1773,UNG BON RONDEAU,"an unbroken sense throughout, and not split into two verses of four"
1774,UNG BON RONDEAU,"lines or five lines, that are by chance printed as though they were"
1775,UNG BON RONDEAU,"one. The needful pauses for punctuation are of course allowed, but the"
1776,UNG BON RONDEAU,"sense should not finish at the end of the first quatrain (or quintain),"
1777,UNG BON RONDEAU,but demand the rest of the verse to complete the idea presented. All
1778,UNG BON RONDEAU,these apparently trivial details must be regarded if the ballade is
1779,UNG BON RONDEAU,"attempted. The advice given in _Alice in Wonderland_, ""Take care of"
1780,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves,"" whether in"
1781,UNG BON RONDEAU,"that way or its inversion, ""Take care of the sounds and the sense will"
1782,UNG BON RONDEAU,"take care of itself,"" is exactly the direct opposite of the true rule."
1783,UNG BON RONDEAU,Neither sense nor sound may be scamped here. If you neglect the sounds
1784,UNG BON RONDEAU,it is no ballade; if you neglect the sense--why write it at all? No one
1785,UNG BON RONDEAU,"is compelled to use these complex forms, but if chosen, their laws"
1786,UNG BON RONDEAU,must be obeyed to the letter if success is to be attained. The chief
1787,UNG BON RONDEAU,"pleasure they yield consists in the apparent spontaneity, which is the"
1788,UNG BON RONDEAU,"result of genius, if genius be indeed the art of taking infinite pains;"
1789,UNG BON RONDEAU,"or, if that definition is rejected, they must yet exhibit the art which"
1790,UNG BON RONDEAU,"conceals art, whether by intense care in every minute detail, or a"
1791,UNG BON RONDEAU,happy faculty for naturally wearing these fetters. The dance in chains
1792,UNG BON RONDEAU,"must be skilful, the chains worn as decorative adjuncts, and the whole"
1793,UNG BON RONDEAU,"with as much apparent ease as the unfettered dancer could produce, or"
1794,UNG BON RONDEAU,woe betide the unlucky wight who attempts to perform in them.
1795,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1796,UNG BON RONDEAU,"The ENVOY is so peculiarly a feature of the Ballade and Chant Royal,"
1797,UNG BON RONDEAU,that it is needful to draw our attention to the invocation which with
1798,UNG BON RONDEAU,it invariably commences. Of old this envoy was really addressed to
1799,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the patron of the poet, or at least to the high dignitary to whom he"
1800,UNG BON RONDEAU,dedicated his ballade. So that we find Prince! or Princess! Sire! or
1801,UNG BON RONDEAU,some mythical or symbolical personality invoked in the opening word.
1802,UNG BON RONDEAU,"Often the person chosen was in very truth a noble of the rank assigned,"
1803,UNG BON RONDEAU,but the custom of opening the envoy in this fashion grew so common that
1804,UNG BON RONDEAU,"it lost its special fitness, and was often employed as a conventional"
1805,UNG BON RONDEAU,"ascription to those not of noble rank, while in some instances all"
1806,UNG BON RONDEAU,the lovers' ballades intended for their own ladies were yet ascribed
1807,UNG BON RONDEAU,"by the poets to the ""Princess"" of the court, who quite understood the"
1808,UNG BON RONDEAU,"fiction employed, and accepted praise of the golden hair and blue eyes"
1809,UNG BON RONDEAU,"of the rightful owner of the poem, while possibly her royal tresses"
1810,UNG BON RONDEAU,were black and her eyes brown. In the number of ballades included
1811,UNG BON RONDEAU,in this collection the larger number will still be found to follow
1812,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the old custom, which is so marked that the use of this dedication"
1813,UNG BON RONDEAU,"certainly carries out the spirit of the poem, in accordance with its"
1814,UNG BON RONDEAU,"original design. The envoy is not only a dedication, but should be the"
1815,UNG BON RONDEAU,"peroration of the subject, and richer in its wording and more stately"
1816,UNG BON RONDEAU,"in its imagery than the preceding verses, to convey the climax of the"
1817,UNG BON RONDEAU,"whole matter, and avoid the suspicion that it is a mere postscript, as"
1818,UNG BON RONDEAU,"it were, to the ballade."
1819,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1820,UNG BON RONDEAU,"In the ballade with stanzas of ten lines, usually of ten syllables"
1821,UNG BON RONDEAU,"each, four rhymes are permitted in this order--A, B, A, B, B, C, C,"
1822,UNG BON RONDEAU,"D, C, D, with C, C, D, C, D for the envoy. It is not needful to quote"
1823,UNG BON RONDEAU,"examples, or describe varieties with eight or ten-lined stanzas, that"
1824,UNG BON RONDEAU,"have lines of equal or unequal length, but in other respects follow"
1825,UNG BON RONDEAU,all the true rules. De Gramont has observed that the strict laws of
1826,UNG BON RONDEAU,the _ballade_ belong more to the prosodists who studied the form
1827,UNG BON RONDEAU,"after it had ceased to be in current use, and that the writers of the"
1828,UNG BON RONDEAU,_ballade_ themselves frequently took great liberty. In some by Marot
1829,UNG BON RONDEAU,"there are verses of eleven or twelve decasyllabic lines, and in poets"
1830,UNG BON RONDEAU,"who preceded him, some with thirteen and fourteen lines to the stanza,"
1831,UNG BON RONDEAU,"while the number of verses has also been flagrantly disregarded, some"
1832,UNG BON RONDEAU,"even using four or five verses, and still worse, having different"
1833,UNG BON RONDEAU,rhymes to them; but in such cases the poem must not be regarded as an
1834,UNG BON RONDEAU,"irregular ballade, nor a ballade at all, but simply as a set of verses"
1835,UNG BON RONDEAU,with refrain.
1836,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1837,UNG BON RONDEAU,"The _Ballade with double refrain_, of which the ""Frere Lubin"" of"
1838,UNG BON RONDEAU,"Clement Marot is the only well-known example in old French, is said"
1839,UNG BON RONDEAU,"by Thomas Sibilet, in his _Art Poétique_, 1555, to be ""_autant rare"
1840,UNG BON RONDEAU,"que plaisante_."" Its point of difference is that a second refrain is"
1841,UNG BON RONDEAU,"introduced at the fourth line of each stanza, and the second of the"
1842,UNG BON RONDEAU,envoy. This necessarily alters the order of the rhymes of the envoy.
1843,UNG BON RONDEAU,"In the best known English example the rhyme order is A, B, A, B, B,"
1844,UNG BON RONDEAU,"C, B, C, with B, B, C, C, for the envoy. There are several in modern"
1845,UNG BON RONDEAU,"English, and some in recent French."
1846,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1847,UNG BON RONDEAU,"The _Double Ballade_ consists of six stanzas of eight or ten lines, and"
1848,UNG BON RONDEAU,"is written usually without an envoy. The ""Ballade of Dead Lions,"" in"
1849,UNG BON RONDEAU,"_London_, January 12, 1878, was the first English specimen; it is not"
1850,UNG BON RONDEAU,"quoted here, as its subject is now out of date. De Banville has written"
1851,UNG BON RONDEAU,"several. ""_Pour les bonnes gens_,"" ""_Des sottises de Paris_"" are two in"
1852,UNG BON RONDEAU,"his ""_Trente-six Ballades Joyeuses_"" written in this form."
1853,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1854,UNG BON RONDEAU,"M. de Banville humorously reveals a secret of the poet's workshop,"
1855,UNG BON RONDEAU,"and gives a method to construct a ""correct"" ballade in a mechanical"
1856,UNG BON RONDEAU,"fashion, dispensing with genius, and easy to work--First, at one"
1857,UNG BON RONDEAU,"sitting write the last half of all the verses, and at another time"
1858,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the first half, then join them together, and the result will be an"
1859,UNG BON RONDEAU,"irremediably bad ballade; but elsewhere he writes, in all seriousness"
1860,UNG BON RONDEAU,"this time, ""All the art is to bring in the refrain without effort,"
1861,UNG BON RONDEAU,"naturally, gaily, and at each time with novel effect and with fresh"
1862,UNG BON RONDEAU,"light cast on the central idea. 'Now you can' teach 'no one to do that,"
1863,UNG BON RONDEAU,and M. de Banville never pretends to give any receipts for cooking
1864,UNG BON RONDEAU,_rondels_ or _ballades_ worth reading.' Without poetic vision all is
1865,UNG BON RONDEAU,"mere marqueterie and cabinetmaker's work; that is, so far as poetry is"
1866,UNG BON RONDEAU,"concerned, nothing.""[7]"

1869,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1870,UNG BON RONDEAU,The CHANT ROYAL is now accepted by most writers as merely a larger
1871,UNG BON RONDEAU,"form of the ballade, written with five verses of eleven lines, and"
1872,UNG BON RONDEAU,envoi of five. De Gramont treats the idea to regard it as a distinct
1873,UNG BON RONDEAU,"form as a mere fanciful attempt of prosodists, founded chiefly on the"
1874,UNG BON RONDEAU,fact that Clement Marot has left four so named which conform to the
1875,UNG BON RONDEAU,above rule; but he shows that on the one hand there are ballades with
1876,UNG BON RONDEAU,"stanzas of eleven lines, and on the other chants royal with ten only."
1877,UNG BON RONDEAU,It has been suggested that the _Chant Royal_ derived its name from
1878,UNG BON RONDEAU,the subjects that are more usually dedicated to its use; but while
1879,UNG BON RONDEAU,"these are generally sublime topics treated in dignified allegory, yet"
1880,UNG BON RONDEAU,there are examples extant entirely devoid of these characteristics.
1881,UNG BON RONDEAU,"Again, the idea that it owes its name to being a form selected for"
1882,UNG BON RONDEAU,"competition before the king for the dignity of laureate, and hence"
1883,UNG BON RONDEAU,"dubbed royal-song, he also rejects, and points out that its name"
1884,UNG BON RONDEAU,simply denotes that it is the most excellent form of the ballade (as
1885,UNG BON RONDEAU,"we might say, the ""king of ballades"" in English), one that, from"
1886,UNG BON RONDEAU,"the increased length, both in stanzas and number of lines in each,"
1887,UNG BON RONDEAU,largely augments the difficulties of construction met with in the
1888,UNG BON RONDEAU,"true ballade, and marks it as ""the final _tour de force_ of poetic"
1889,UNG BON RONDEAU,"composition."" Henry de Croï derives the title of this form from the"
1890,UNG BON RONDEAU,fact that persons excelling in the composition of chants royal were
1891,UNG BON RONDEAU,worthy to be crowned with garlands like conquerors and kings. It is
1892,UNG BON RONDEAU,a moot point with students whether the ballade or chant royal is the
1893,UNG BON RONDEAU,earlier and original poem. The chant royal in the old form is usually
1894,UNG BON RONDEAU,"devoted to the unfolding of an allegory in its five stanzas, the envoy"
1895,UNG BON RONDEAU,supplying the key; but this is not always observed in modern examples.
1896,UNG BON RONDEAU,"Whatever be the subject, however, it must always march in stately"
1897,UNG BON RONDEAU,"rhythm with splendid imagery, using all the poetic adornments of"
1898,UNG BON RONDEAU,"sonorous, highly-wrought lines and rich embroidery of words to clothe"
1899,UNG BON RONDEAU,a theme in itself a lofty one. Unless the whole poem is constructed
1900,UNG BON RONDEAU,"with intense care, and has intrinsic beauty of its own of no mean"
1901,UNG BON RONDEAU,"order, the monotony of its sixty-one lines rhymed on five sounds is"
1902,UNG BON RONDEAU,unbearable. In spite of the increased burden imposed by the necessity
1903,UNG BON RONDEAU,"of so many similar rhymes, no shadow of ""poetic"" or other license must"
1904,UNG BON RONDEAU,be taken. Nothing short of complete success can warrant the choice of
1905,UNG BON RONDEAU,"this exacting form, which demands all that can be given to it; enriched"
1906,UNG BON RONDEAU,"with all the elaboration of consummate art in its every detail, and"
1907,UNG BON RONDEAU,"rising stanza by stanza, until the climax is reached in the envoy."
1908,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1909,UNG BON RONDEAU,"The laws of the ballade apply to the chant royal, with some added"
1910,UNG BON RONDEAU,"details of its own. The rhyme order is usually--a, b, a, b, c, c, d, d,"
1911,UNG BON RONDEAU,"e, d, e, with envoy of d, d, e, d, e. An example by Deschamps, ""_Sur le"
1912,UNG BON RONDEAU,"mort du Seigneur de Coucy_,"" observes this order, a, b, a, b, b, c, c,"
1913,UNG BON RONDEAU,"d, c, d, and envoy, c, c, d, c, c, d. In either case the rhyme-order"
1914,UNG BON RONDEAU,"must be kept the same for each stanza, and the envoy commenced with an"
1915,UNG BON RONDEAU,invocation as in the old ballades.
1916,UNG BON RONDEAU,
1917,UNG BON RONDEAU,"CHAIN VERSE.--There is one beautiful poem in so-called chain verse,"
1918,UNG BON RONDEAU,which has so much likeness to these once-exotic forms that it deserves
1919,UNG BON RONDEAU,"quotation in full, if only as an example of a native specimen of poetic"
1920,UNG BON RONDEAU,"ingenuity. It has little affinity with the chain verse of French art,"
1921,UNG BON RONDEAU,as then the one word only grew from each line into the other (La rime

2025,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"recent variations of its form. In its origin, the rondel was a lyric"

2043,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,Nor are these rondel-triolets exceptions; they are quite common till
2044,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,the beginning of the fifteenth century. With Charles d'Orléans the
2045,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"rondel took the distinct shape we now assign to it, namely, of fourteen"
2046,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"lines on two rhymes, the first two lines repeating for the seventh"
2047,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"and eighth, and the final couplet (see page 135). In this, the true"
2048,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"type of the rondel, the two-lined refrain occurring three times in its"
2049,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,fourteen makes it an unwieldy form to handle. In later French ones the
2050,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"last refrain uses but one of its lines. In Mr. Austin Dobson's ""The"
2051,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"Wanderer,"" the rhymes are in this order:--A. B. b. a.--a. b. A. B.--a."
2052,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,b. b. a. A. (the refrain being marked by capital letters). In another
2053,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"by the same author, ""How hard it is to Sing,"" the rhyme order is A. B."
2054,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,a. b.--b. a. A. B.--a. b. a. b. A. B.; the rondel of Charles d'Orléans
2055,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,having A. B. b. a. a. b. A. B.--a. b. b. a. A. B. The length of the
2056,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,lines is not confined to any particular number of syllables in modern
2057,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,examples.
2058,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,
2059,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,By the time of Octavien de Saint Gelais (1466-1502) the rondel has
2060,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,nearly become the rondeau as we know it. Still rhymed on but two
2061,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"sounds, it repeats the first line only, nor always the whole of that,"
2062,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,as the quoted examples show:--

2081,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"reiteration of the text, but linked with the preceding verse, as a"
2082,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"refrain should be, and absorbed into the sense of the whole stanza to"
2083,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"which it belongs. This change is still more noticeable in the rondel,"
2084,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"using but half the first line for its refrain, as in this example:--"

2100,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,
2101,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,Here we pass into the later form called (for convenience only) the
2102,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"_Rondeau_. In these few examples the evolution of the _Voiture_ type,"
2103,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"from the Charles d'Orléans original, is clearly traceable. The rondel,"
2104,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"however, still continues to be used, but much less frequently. De"
2105,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"Banville often omits the thirteenth line, while otherwise following the"
2106,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"model of Charles d'Orléans. Again, the order of the rhymes is sometimes"
2107,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"changed, but the examples quoted in this collection will show more"
2108,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,clearly the deviations from the true rondel than any description would
2109,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,do.
2110,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,
2111,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,The RONDEAU after Voiture's model is without doubt the most popular
2112,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"variety of the form now in use. It is written throughout on two rhymes,"
2113,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,being composed of thirteen lines and two unrhymed refrains. The lines
2114,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"are now nearly always of eight syllables only, in many of the old ones"
2115,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,they were of ten. The refrain is usually made from the first half of
2116,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"the first line, but it is not uncommon to find the first word only"
2117,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"taken for this use. Its thirteen lines are grouped in three stanzas,"
2118,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"the first and third having five lines each, the second consisting of"
2119,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"three only. The refrain occurs at the end of the second stanza, and at"
2120,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"the close of the poem. The usual rhyme order is a, a, b, b, a,----a,"
2121,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"a, b (and refrain)--a, a, b, b, a, and refrain. The refrain is not"
2122,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"counted among the lines of the verse, but is added to the thirteen, and"
2123,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"in the neatness of its introduction, and in the way each of the two"
2124,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"verses to which it belongs flow into it, so that it forms an integral"
2125,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"and inseparable part of the stanza, the chief difficulty of the rondeau"
2126,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"lies. If, like an ""Amen"" to a hymn, the refrain comes merely as an"
2127,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"extraneous comment on the preceding lines, it is no true rondeau. At"
2128,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,the risk of reiteration of a warning given in the description of each
2129,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"of these poems that use a refrain, this point must be insisted on, as"
2130,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,the most vital one. The mechanical laws of the poem may be obeyed with
2131,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"scrupulous exactitude, and every technical rule complied with, while"
2132,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,the still more important quality of sense is overlooked. The thought
2133,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,of the poet must so find its expression that the refrain completes
2134,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"it, and forms the true climax of his speech--the culminating phrase"
2135,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"of his sentence. The refrain is the very text of the whole discourse,"
2136,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"in itself an epitome of the subject of the whole poem, otherwise the"
2137,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"reason for its existence in one of these fixed shapes is wanting, and"
2138,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,the poem would be better in free verse. In the refrain the sound must
2139,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"reappear exactly, but the sense may be altered; in fact, this playful"
2140,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,variation of its meaning is one of the charms of the verse when used
2141,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,for lighter and more dainty subjects. The good taste of the author must
2142,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,decide how far an actual pun is allowable. There are precedents for the
2143,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"use of the pun pure and simple--""votre beau thé"" ""vòtre beauté,"" or, ""à"
2144,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"la fontaine,"" used in its literal sense, and also with reference to the"
2145,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"famous fabulist. But in English use the pun has fallen into disrepute,"
2146,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,perhaps from the execrable word-contortions of our so-called comic
2147,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"papers and its terrible vulgarity in stage burlesques, the intrusion"
2148,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,of one is fatal to the delicacy and refinement which are the peculiar
2149,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"charm of the rondeau. But if a play upon words of a scholarly kind, or"
2150,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"a new reading given either by punctuation, or the use of the words"
2151,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"with a new light thrown on them by the lines leading up to the refrain,"
2152,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"can be secured, every effort should be made to vary the refrain by so"
2153,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,doing.
2154,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,
2155,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,This quality of dainty and spontaneous wit is the secret of the
2156,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"rondeau, only revealed, if it is to be found at all, by close analysis"
2157,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"of the best examples. De Banville quotes three of Voiture's--""Je ne"
2158,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"sçaurois,"" ""L'Amour,"" and ""Penser""--especially for this all-important"
2159,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,feature; but in this volume may be found examples equally worthy of
2160,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,study. It would be invidious to draw attention to the best of those
2161,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"that have been allowed to appear here, but if the wit of the would-be"
2162,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"rondeau-maker fails to discover the successful use of the refrain, and"
2163,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"to pick out the best examples, it is in itself evidence that he had"
2164,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,better abstain from trying to produce rondeaus that would certainly
2165,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,lack the airy grace and caressing tenderness which should be an element
2166,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,of this verse. A famous example of Voiture's is quoted on page 134.
2167,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,
2168,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"The following is its English paraphrase by Mr. Austin Dobson, withdrawn"
2169,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"from his later editions, but quoted now by his consent:--"
2170,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,

2172,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,A Rondeau. What! forthwith?--To-night?

2174,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,But thirteen lines!--and rhymed on two!--
2175,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"""Refrain,"" as well. Ah, hapless plight!"
2176,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,Still there are five lines--ranged aright.
2177,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"These Gallic bonds, I feared, would fright"
2178,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"My easy Muse. They did, till you--"
2179,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,_You_ bid me try!
2180,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,
2181,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"""That makes them eight.--The port's in sight:"
2182,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,Tis all because your eyes are bright!
2183,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"Now just a pair to end in ""oo,""--"
2184,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"When maids command, what can't we do!"
2185,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"Behold! The RONDEAU--tasteful, light--"
2186,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"You bid me try!"""
2187,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,
2188,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"A study of rondeaus will show, both in ancient and modern examples,"
2189,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"some little alteration of the rhyme-order, and a few trivial"
2190,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,differences in other respects. But as the sonnet has evolved through
2191,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,many stages into one accepted shape that is now permanently fixed as
2192,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"its true type, so the rondeau of Voiture may be taken as the typical"
2193,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"form to be imitated--the one that has, by process of selection,"
2194,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"been proved to be the best to display the subject of the poem, and"
2195,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"to work-in the refrains to the best advantage. Like the sonnet, the"
2196,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,perfected form is jealously guarded. The genius which consists in
2197,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"breaking rules is looked upon with suspicion in all these forms, but"
2198,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,especially in this one. There are some beautiful variations in old
2199,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"and new examples where the shape is widely varied, but these stand"
2200,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"apart from the pure rondeaus of Voiture, and are generally still"
2201,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,more difficult to construct by reason of the additional laws the
2202,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,writers have imposed on themselves. But the trifling evasion of the
2203,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"rhyme-order, a want of exactitude on the repetition of the refrain,"
2204,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,is apt to be taken as evidence of lack of power to conform gracefully
2205,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"to the bonds, and not as an outburst of genius that is too strong"
2206,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,to be confined in such puny fetters. But there are a few _poems_ in
2207,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"these forms written fairly near the true shape, which, like some"
2208,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"irregular, but yet in themselves beautiful sonnets, are not to be"
2209,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,condemned solely for being impure in form. For the sake of poetry one
2210,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"is ready to forgive much, but it must be only real _poetry_ that takes"
2211,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,such liberty; and all the time comes a wish that having gone so near
2212,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"perfection of shape as well as of sense, the poet had taken the last"
2213,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,steps needful to make his poem perfect in each respect.
2214,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,
2215,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"There is another form than Voiture's, which is equally a true"
2216,THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH.,"rondeau--that used by Villon. This is quoted, with Mr. Payne's"

2261,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","for the sake of convenience. Since Mr. Swinburne devoted a volume,"
2262,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","entitled _A Century of Roundels_, to this particular form of the"
2263,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","rondeau, it has been used by other writers, and the name applied by"

2267,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","formulated this variety, which slightly differs from any I have been"

2273,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",refrain; but when the refrain consists of more than a single word it

2307,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2308,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",The RONDEAU REDOUBLÉ would fail to suggest kinship with either form
2309,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","of the Rondeau, did not it include the name in its designation, as"
2310,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",De Banville notes. It is probable that many more poems were grouped
2311,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",under the word Rondeau than we now are able to trace. The one we are
2312,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","now describing is in no way a doubled rondeau, and hardly suggests"
2313,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",that form more than any of these that have the features of limited
2314,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","rhyme sounds, and more or less frequent reiteration of a refrain. The"
2315,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","Rondeau Redoublé is written in six octosyllabic quatrains, rhyming on"
2316,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","two alternate rhymes, with half the initial line used (unrhymed) after"
2317,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",the last verse. Its one distinctive feature is this:--Each line of the
2318,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",first quatrain is used again in the same order to serve for the last
2319,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","line of verses two, three, four, and five; while the last line of the"
2320,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","sixth has a new wording for itself, but takes, in addition, a final"
2321,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",refrain of the first half of the initial line of the poem to conclude
2322,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","the whole. As the rhymes of the first quatrain are a. b. a. b., it must"
2323,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",necessarily--to use as refrain the first line rhyming on _a_--reverse
2324,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","the order for the second verse, which is therefore b. a. b. a., and so"
2325,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",on alternately until the end of the rondeau redoublé. Specimens of its
2326,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","use are extant by Marot, La Fontaine, Benserade, and others, while"
2327,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","in modern French it is not infrequent, but in English it is rare. The"
2328,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",examples quoted in this book comprise all that diligent search could
2329,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",discover except one of too fugitive a character to reprint. As the
2330,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",poems written in this form in English show the rules of the verse as
2331,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","plainly as the original French, it has not been thought needful to"
2332,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","quote one in its native tongue, especially as De Gramont, De Banville,"
2333,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",and Jullien reprint specimens in their handbooks. A form so simple
2334,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","that, if well wrought, and the refrain brought in with skill, it can be"
2335,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","read in a casual way, without discovering that it was written to exact"
2336,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","rules, deserves more use. The disposition of the subject is excellently"
2337,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","laid out; a ""text,"" four ""divisions,"" and ""in conclusion,"" with the"
2338,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","text repeated, is a method so familiar to Englishmen on Sundays that"
2339,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",the order for variations on the initial theme is peculiarly easy: nor
2340,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","need the result be the least like a sermon, although this description"
2341,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",of its shape is suggestive of one.
2342,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2343,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","Another form, the GLOSE, resembles the Rondeau Redoublé in many ways;"
2344,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","indeed, it may be almost looked upon as a freer form of that poem."
2345,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","It appears, however, to be of distinct origin, and very rare in"
2346,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","French poetry, although much used in Spanish and Portuguese verse. It"
2347,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","begins, like the Rondeau Redoublé, with a quatrain, here called the"
2348,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",_texte_;--this is usually a quotation from a former poet. This text
2349,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","the Glose proceeds to comment on, or amplify, in four stanzas of ten"
2350,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","lines, closing each as in the rondeau redoublé, with one of the lines"
2351,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",of the text in the original order; but the necessity for restricting
2352,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","the rhymes to two is not observed here. Each stanza has the sixth,"
2353,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","ninth, and tenth (the refrain) line, rhyming on the same sound, but"
2354,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","the others appear to be chosen at the fancy of the writer, while the"
2355,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",final refrain of the rondeau redoublé is also wanting in the glose.
2356,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","First employed solely for serious themes of religion or philosophy, it"
2357,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","is now in France, like the once sacred triolet, devoted to parody and"
2358,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",the lightest forms of humour. Owing to the impossibility of collating
2359,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","the mass of periodical literature of the last ten or fifteen years, it"
2360,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","would be rash to say that the _glose_ has never appeared in English,"
2361,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","but not one has been discovered to include in this book. Yet, as De"
2362,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",Gramont places the shape among those he includes as frequently used in
2363,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","France, it seemed best to give here a brief outline of its form. De"
2364,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","Banville quotes one by Jean François Sarazin formed on the sonnet ""de"
2365,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","IOB"" by Benserade, where fourteen quatrains are ended by the lines of"
2366,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","the sonnet, employed in their original order. This form offers a field"
2367,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",for serious comment or sarcastic parody that deserves working.
2368,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2369,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","The SESTINA, invented by the famous troubadour, Arnaut Daniel, at the"
2370,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","end of the thirteenth century, has not been used in French poetry so"
2371,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",often as the ballade and rondeau. There are specimens in the poetry
2372,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","of Pontus de Thyard, and one in the Pleiade of the sixteenth century,"
2373,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","besides many others, but it has been comparatively an exotic in French"
2374,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","poetry, as in English, until recent years. That it was used and admired"
2375,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","by Dante and Petrarch, alone gives the sestina a royal precedence over"
2376,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",all of the other forms. Many judges consider it to be the supreme work
2377,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","of poetic art in fixed forms, while others claim similar distinction"
2378,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","for the chant royal, and not a few for the sonnet. To distinguish"
2379,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","between the charms of these three royal forms would need a Paris, nor"
2380,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","is it necessary to do so, since each will to his own taste, no matter"
2381,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",who claims authority on the ever-disputed question of supreme beauty.
2382,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","Mr. Hueffer in his ""Troubadours"" has a chapter so full of interest and"
2383,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","teeming with information of the growth of the stanza, that in despair"
2384,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","of condensing its knowledge within the space possible here, the mere"
2385,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",notice of it must suffice. De Gramont give the rules of the poem as
2386,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","written by the originator and followers in Italy, Spain, and Portugal:--"
2387,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2388,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","1st.--The Sestina has six stanzas, each of six lines, these being of"
2389,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",the same length.
2390,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2391,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","2nd.--The lines of the six verses end with the six same words, not"
2392,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",rhyming with each other; these end words are chosen exclusively from
2393,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",two syllabled nouns.
2394,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2395,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",3rd.--The arrangement of these six terminal words follows a regular law
2396,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","(a somewhat complex one, which is replaced in modern poetry by the one"
2397,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",given below).
2398,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2399,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","4th.--The piece closes with a three-line stanza, using the six words,"
2400,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","three at the end; the other three, placed in the middle of its lines."
2401,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2402,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","But, as now written, the words of the sestina at times rhyme with each"
2403,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","other; if so, De Banville says they should be in two rhymes alone (as"
2404,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","Mr. Swinburne uses them), but other writers allow three rhymes. But"
2405,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",these details all belong to the subtle laws of the verse which it is
2406,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","not possible to include here. De Gramont's _Sestines_ is, perhaps, the"
2407,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",best authority for study.
2408,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2409,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","For our purpose, enough to say that the six end-words must repeat"
2410,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",unchanged in sound and spelling throughout each succeeding verse.
2411,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",The order in which they occur is best expressed by a numerical
2412,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","formula. If the rules themselves were compressed, a more complex and"
2413,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","incomprehensible jargon of firsts and seconds and thirds, etc., could"
2414,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","hardly be found. The first verse has, of course, the initial order, 1,"
2415,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","2, 3, 4, 5, 6; the second, 6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3; the third, 3, 6, 4, 1,"
2416,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","2, 5; the fourth, 5, 3, 2, 6, 1, 4; the fifth, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2; the"
2417,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","sixth, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3, 1; the last half-stanza ends with 2, 4, 6, and"
2418,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","uses 1, 3, 5 at the beginning (not the first word always) of the line,"
2419,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",or at the half-line in rhymes that permit their introduction there. It
2420,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","will be seen that no end-word occurs more than once in the same place,"
2421,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",and that the end-word of every stanza is invariably chosen to take its
2422,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",place as terminal of the first line of the next verse.
2423,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2424,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","As though this feat in rhyming were not complex enough, a double"
2425,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",sestina of twelve verses of twelve lines has been sometimes written.

2432,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",representative as possible forbade their quotation.
2433,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2434,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","THE TRIOLET, as we know it, may be regarded as almost an epitome of"
2435,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","the other forms, in its limited space. It introduces one refrain three"
2436,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","times, and the second refrain twice, keeps strictly to two rhymes, and"

2440,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","so simply upon its own innocent axis."" Those who are unaware of the"
2441,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","rules that govern this little stanza, yet often fall in love with the"
2442,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","verse itself, possibly because a good example has a pretty sequence"
2443,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","of sound, that allures the ear by its musical jingle, and reads like"
2444,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","a spontaneous and easy impromptu. Nevertheless, the subtle art needed"
2445,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",to acquire the ease that is the charm of a good triolet is generally
2446,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",the result of infinite care. Few things are more simple than to write
2447,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",a triolet--of a sort--yet the triolet affords so little space to
2448,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","explain its motif, and within its five lines must tell its story, and"
2449,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","also carry the three other repeated ones easily, and with a definite"
2450,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","meaning. To introduce the refrain naturally as the only thing to say,"
2451,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",and yet with an air of freshness and an unexpected recognition of a
2452,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","phrase heard before, is in itself no mean difficulty, even in the"
2453,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","ballade and rondeau; but when it comes three times in eight lines, and"
2454,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","has a second line attached to it on its first and last appearance,"
2455,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",it is a matter of small wonder that the successful triolets are not
2456,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","very numerous. That the ideally perfect triolet is as yet unwritten,"
2457,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","or at least represented by very few, it may be urged; but if that be"
2458,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","true, it should only provoke more attempts, one would fancy. It might"
2459,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","be pertinent to ask, if this is the chief objection, how many ideally"
2460,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","perfect poems in any set shape, or in free form, the world acknowledges?"
2461,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2462,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",The triolet consists (to quote Mr. Dobson) of _eight_ lines with _two_
2463,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","rhymes. The first pair of lines are repeated as the seventh and eighth,"
2464,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",while the first is repeated as the fourth. The order of the rhymes is
2465,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",thus as follows:--a. b. a. a. a. b. a. b. The example (on page 214)
2466,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","by--of all persons in the world--a grave French magistrate, Jacques"
2467,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","Ranchin, has been christened by Ménage the ""King of _Triolets_."""
2468,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",
2469,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",The first triolet known is in the Cléomadés of Adenèz-le-Roi
2470,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","(1258-1297), a poem of 20,000 verses. In old examples the triolet was"
2471,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","devoted to grave verse, but, as M. de Gramont shows, it has now not"
2472,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","only abandoned the old ten syllable lines, and is written in those of"
2473,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","eight and often six syllables, but from the elegiac dignity of its"
2474,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","former subjects, it has become in French verse the form especially"
2475,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",devoted to the most ephemeral and trivial subjects. Since M. de
2476,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","Banville renewed its use, triolets are common in French newspapers, and"
2477,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",with all due deference be it said--possibly only thereby exposing my
2478,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",own ignorance of the subtle charm conveyed to their readers by their
2479,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.","""argot"" and ""idiom""--as inferior as they are plentiful. There is one,"

2509,"LAY, OR RATHER RONDEAU.",perhaps a would-be writer of triolets could secure correct form by

2577,ROSE.,"a valuable essay on the history and construction of the poem, and a"

2579,ROSE.,of singular beauty.

2581,ROSE.,The LAI and the VIRELAI are so nearly related that they must be
2582,ROSE.,"considered together. De Gramont says, that the _lai_ has been unused"
2583,ROSE.,"since the earliest days in French poetry, but as it is invariably"
2584,ROSE.,"quoted in all treatises on the art, he prints a seventeenth century"
2585,ROSE.,"one, evidently written as a specimen to illustrate its laws. De"
2586,ROSE.,"Banville cites the following by Pere Mourgues, from his _Traité de la"

2603,LAI.,
2604,FROM OVERSEA.,FROM OVERSEA.
2605,FROM OVERSEA.,
2606,FROM OVERSEA.,From oversea--
2607,FROM OVERSEA.,"Violets, for memories,"
2608,FROM OVERSEA.,I send to thee.
2609,FROM OVERSEA.,
2610,FROM OVERSEA.,"Let them bear thought of me,"
2611,FROM OVERSEA.,With pleasant memories
2612,FROM OVERSEA.,"To touch the heart of thee,"
2613,FROM OVERSEA.,Far oversea.

2615,FROM OVERSEA.,"A little way it is for love to flee,"
2616,FROM OVERSEA.,"Love wing'd with memories,"
2617,FROM OVERSEA.,Hither to thither oversea.
2618,FROM OVERSEA.,
2619,FROM OVERSEA.,--_William Sharp._
2620,FROM OVERSEA.,
2621,FROM OVERSEA.,In the French example the form is seen to be composed of couplets of
2622,FROM OVERSEA.,"five syllable lines, all on the same rhyme, separated by single lines"
2623,FROM OVERSEA.,"of two syllables, also on one rhyme throughout the stanza, which"
2624,FROM OVERSEA.,therefore employs but two rhymes. The number of lines in each verse
2625,FROM OVERSEA.,"was not fixed, nor the number of verses in the complete poem. The LAI"
2626,FROM OVERSEA.,has preserved a curious old tradition in the form it appears either
2627,FROM OVERSEA.,"in writing or print. As in the verse quoted, the first letter of each"
2628,FROM OVERSEA.,line begins exactly under the preceding one; not with the short line
2629,FROM OVERSEA.,indented--that is coming under the middle of the larger ones--usual
2630,FROM OVERSEA.,in other poems composed of lines of irregular length. This detail was
2631,FROM OVERSEA.,"called _Arbre fourchu_ (a forked tree), from the fanciful resemblance"
2632,FROM OVERSEA.,"of a trunk with bare branches projecting, found by imaginative persons"
2633,FROM OVERSEA.,in its appearance on paper.
2634,FROM OVERSEA.,
2635,FROM OVERSEA.,"In the Lai each fresh stanza of the poem has its own two rhyme sounds,"
2636,FROM OVERSEA.,"without reference to the preceding ones. By curtailing this liberty,"
2637,FROM OVERSEA.,and compelling each succeeding stanza to take the rhyme for its longer
2638,FROM OVERSEA.,"lines, from the short line of the preceding verse the Virelai is"
2639,FROM OVERSEA.,produced.
2640,FROM OVERSEA.,
2641,FROM OVERSEA.,The VIRELAI (ancien) is a lai that preserves a sequence of rhymes
2642,FROM OVERSEA.,"throughout. For example, in a twelve-line stanza the rhymes are A. A."
2643,FROM OVERSEA.,b. A. A. b. A. A. b. A. A. b. (the long lines being marked by capital
2644,FROM OVERSEA.,"letters, and the shorter by small ones). Therefore, to follow the rules"
2645,FROM OVERSEA.,"of the virelai, the next verse must have its rhymes B. B. c. B. B. c."
2646,FROM OVERSEA.,"B. B. c. B. B. c., and the next C. C. d. C. C. d., and so on until the"
2647,FROM OVERSEA.,last verse (taking seven verses for an example) would have G. G. a. G.
2648,FROM OVERSEA.,"G. a. G. G. a. G. G. a., its short lines rhyming with the two first"
2649,FROM OVERSEA.,"lines of the poem. Thus each rhyme appears twice, once in its longer"
2650,FROM OVERSEA.,"couplets, once in the short single lines. In the English examples this"
2651,FROM OVERSEA.,"rule is preserved, but the length of the lines are frequently varied."
2652,FROM OVERSEA.,
2653,FROM OVERSEA.,The VIRELAI (Rhythme d'Alain Chartier) by Boulmier may be quoted as a
2654,FROM OVERSEA.,form yet unused (I believe) in England.
2655,FROM OVERSEA.,
2656,FROM OVERSEA.,Triste remembrance!
2657,FROM OVERSEA.,Hé! Dieu! quand i'y pense
2658,FROM OVERSEA.,Ce m'est grand penance:
2659,FROM OVERSEA.,Las! de ma iouuence
2660,FROM OVERSEA.,A passé la flour.

2676,FROM OVERSEA.,"En moy fay retour,"
2677,FROM OVERSEA.,Ne fust-ce qu'vng iour...
2678,FROM OVERSEA.,Et ie recommence.
2679,FROM OVERSEA.,
2680,FROM OVERSEA.,"The rhymes are a, a, a, a, b; a, a, a, b; b, b, b, b, a; b, b, b, b,"
2681,FROM OVERSEA.,"a. As but one example has come to notice, so it must speak for itself,"
2682,FROM OVERSEA.,for it would be unfair to deduce rules from a single specimen. Before
2683,FROM OVERSEA.,"leaving this heading there is another form, the _Virelai nouveau_,"
2684,FROM OVERSEA.,singularly unlike its name. It is curious that both the Rondeau
2685,FROM OVERSEA.,"Redoublé and this one, masquerading under the names of well-known"
2686,FROM OVERSEA.,"forms, should be each unlike their unqualified title, and yet so nearly"
2687,FROM OVERSEA.,akin to the other.
2688,FROM OVERSEA.,
2689,FROM OVERSEA.,The _Virelai nouveau_ is written throughout in two rhymes. Like the
2690,FROM OVERSEA.,"_rondeau redoublé_, its first stanza serves as refrain for the later"
2691,FROM OVERSEA.,"ones, but its initial verse is but a couplet, and the two lines"
2692,FROM OVERSEA.,"close each stanza alternately until the last, where they appear both"
2693,FROM OVERSEA.,"together, but in inverse order. Unfortunately, space forbids an example"
2694,FROM OVERSEA.,"being quoted in its complete length. The one usually chosen is ""Le"
2695,FROM OVERSEA.,"Rimeur Rebuté;"" this commences with the couplet--"
2696,FROM OVERSEA.,
2697,FROM OVERSEA.,"Adieu vous dy, triste Lyre,"
2698,FROM OVERSEA.,C'est trop apprêter à rire.
2699,FROM OVERSEA.,
2700,FROM OVERSEA.,"Then follows a five-line stanza, rhyming a, a, b, a, a, with ""Adieu"
2701,FROM OVERSEA.,"vous dy,"" etc., for its last line; then an eight-lined one rhymed"
2702,FROM OVERSEA.,"a, b, a, a, b, a, b, a, the last line being ""_C'est trop_,"" etc.;"
2703,FROM OVERSEA.,that is followed by a four-line one closing with first line; then
2704,FROM OVERSEA.,"a sixteen-line one, using the second line for its refrain; then a"
2705,FROM OVERSEA.,"seventeen-line one, with first line ending it; and finally a five-line"
2706,FROM OVERSEA.,"stanza, its last lines being--"
2707,FROM OVERSEA.,
2708,FROM OVERSEA.,"C'est trop apprêter à rire,"
2709,FROM OVERSEA.,"Adieu vous dy, triste lyre."
2710,FROM OVERSEA.,
2711,FROM OVERSEA.,"If this description conveys its intended meaning, it will be seen that"
2712,FROM OVERSEA.,"the verses are singularly irregular in form, and choose both the order"
2713,FROM OVERSEA.,of the rhymes and the length of the verses exactly at the will of the
2714,FROM OVERSEA.,poet; but each paragraph must not only use its proper refrain to close
2715,FROM OVERSEA.,"with, but must bring it in naturally and easily as an inherent part of"
2716,FROM OVERSEA.,the verse. The last two lines in the inverted order must also be worked
2717,FROM OVERSEA.,"in with equal skill. Excepting one by Mr. Austin Dobson, that appeared"
2718,FROM OVERSEA.,"in _Evening Hours_ about 1878, this form has been unused, or at least"
2719,FROM OVERSEA.,"unpublished, in English verse."

2722,FROM OVERSEA.,
2723,FROM OVERSEA.,The poems in the following collections have been chosen for several
2724,FROM OVERSEA.,"reasons--some for their intrinsic excellence, some as examples of pure"
2725,FROM OVERSEA.,"form, some for their bold attempts to produce variations from the"
2726,FROM OVERSEA.,"typical models. There has been no limit to the subjects, since the"
2727,FROM OVERSEA.,"purpose was to give a representative group of the rhythms, treated in"
2728,FROM OVERSEA.,the most diverse ways. Even burlesque and diatribe of the use of the
2729,FROM OVERSEA.,"forms, masquerading in guise of the enemy they professed to attack,"
2730,FROM OVERSEA.,"have been welcomed, as the points of the construction of the verse"
2731,FROM OVERSEA.,are often seen more clearly in such examples. For similar reasons
2732,FROM OVERSEA.,"the parody of the pioneer Ballade, Mr. Austin Dobson's _Prodigals_,"
2733,FROM OVERSEA.,"is quoted, since the doubtful honour of parody is at least a proof"
2734,FROM OVERSEA.,"of wide popularity, the only others marked in this way being Mr."
2735,FROM OVERSEA.,"Swinburne's '_Dreamland_' and Mr. Lang's '_Primitive Man_.' Here,"
2736,FROM OVERSEA.,"too, in default of a better place, it may be noted that Mr. Henley's"
2737,FROM OVERSEA.,'Villonism' is not an imitation of the incomprehensible ballades in
2738,FROM OVERSEA.,"'Jargon' or 'Jobelin,' but a paraphrase in thieves' patter of to-day of"
2739,FROM OVERSEA.,Villon's _Ballade of Good Counsel_.
2740,FROM OVERSEA.,
2741,FROM OVERSEA.,It may be that such a medley of themes handled in so many different
2742,FROM OVERSEA.,"ways, was never of set purpose grouped side by side before, but is to"
2743,FROM OVERSEA.,be hoped that a method in the madness will be found. While conscious
2744,FROM OVERSEA.,"of a few noteworthy examples, Rossetti's _Translations from Villon_ to"
2745,FROM OVERSEA.,"wit, being not included for reasons beyond my control, so it may be"
2746,FROM OVERSEA.,"that one or two here inserted would have been replaced by later comers,"
2747,FROM OVERSEA.,had they not gone to the printer's eternity of stereotype. Started as
2748,FROM OVERSEA.,"a collection, but turned perforce to a selection, from the increasing"
2749,FROM OVERSEA.,"number available, they yet do not aim so much at being a selection of"
2750,FROM OVERSEA.,"the best work solely, as of the best and least-accessible examples."
2751,FROM OVERSEA.,This explanation of the progress and purpose of the volume is offered
2752,FROM OVERSEA.,in common fairness both to its readers and to those authors who have
2753,FROM OVERSEA.,"permitted their works to be included, also to those who by oversight or"
