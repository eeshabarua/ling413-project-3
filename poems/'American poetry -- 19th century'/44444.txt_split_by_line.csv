273,PATTY PROUD.,
274,PATTY PROUD.,The figure before you is Miss Patty Proud:
275,PATTY PROUD.,"Her feelings are lowery, her frown like a cloud;"
276,PATTY PROUD.,Because proud Miss Patty can hardly endure
277,PATTY PROUD.,To come near the lowly abode of the poor.
278,PATTY PROUD.,
279,PATTY PROUD.,She fears the plain floor of the humble will spoil
280,PATTY PROUD.,"Her silk shoes and hose, and her skirt-bottom soil;"
281,PATTY PROUD.,And so she goes winching; and holds up her dress
282,PATTY PROUD.,"So high, it were well if her heels would show less."
283,PATTY PROUD.,
284,PATTY PROUD.,"But when she walks through the fine streets of the town,"
285,PATTY PROUD.,"She puts on fine airs, and displays her rich gown;"
286,PATTY PROUD.,"Till some, whom she passes, will think of the bird"
287,PATTY PROUD.,"Renowned for gay feathers, whose name you have heard."
288,PATTY PROUD.,
289,PATTY PROUD.,In thought she is trifling--in manner as vain
290,PATTY PROUD.,"As that silly fowl, taking pride in his train;"
291,PATTY PROUD.,"And none, who have marked her, will need to be told"
292,PATTY PROUD.,"That she has a heart hard, and haughty, and cold."
293,PATTY PROUD.,
294,PATTY PROUD.,"I saw, when she met some poor children one day,"
295,PATTY PROUD.,"Who asked her for alms, she turned frowning away;"
296,PATTY PROUD.,"And told them, ""Poor people must work, to be fed,"
297,PATTY PROUD.,"And not trouble ladies, to help them to bread."""
298,PATTY PROUD.,
299,PATTY PROUD.,"And just as the sad little mendicants said,"
300,PATTY PROUD.,"Their mother was dying, their father was dead,"

303,PATTY PROUD.,
304,PATTY PROUD.,"I saw her curl up her sour lip in disdain,"

312,PATTY PROUD.,"And fret at the servants, if all is not right."
313,PATTY PROUD.,
314,PATTY PROUD.,"At home, she 's unyielding, and sullen, and cross:"
315,PATTY PROUD.,"Her friends, when she 's absent, esteem it no loss;"
316,PATTY PROUD.,"And some, where she visits, in secret confess,"
317,PATTY PROUD.,"That they love her no more, though they dread her much less."
318,PATTY PROUD.,
319,PATTY PROUD.,"The truth is, Miss Patty, when young, never tried"
320,PATTY PROUD.,"To govern her temper, or conquer her pride."
321,PATTY PROUD.,"The passions, unchecked in the heart of the child,"
322,PATTY PROUD.,"Like weeds in a garden neglected, ran wild."
323,PATTY PROUD.,
324,PATTY PROUD.,"They grew with her growth, with her strength became strong:"
325,PATTY PROUD.,"Her head, not then righted, has ever been wrong;"
326,PATTY PROUD.,And so she would never submit to be told
327,PATTY PROUD.,"Of faults, by long habit made stubborn and bold."
328,PATTY PROUD.,
329,PATTY PROUD.,"And now, among all my young friends, is there one,--"
330,PATTY PROUD.,"A fair little girl is there under the sun,"

4160,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Poor speckled one! none else will deign
4161,THE SPECKLED ONE.,To waft thy name around;
4162,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"So, let me take it on my strain,"
4163,THE SPECKLED ONE.,To give it air and sound.
4164,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4165,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Yes--air and sound, low child of earth!"
4166,THE SPECKLED ONE.,For these are oft the things
4167,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"That give a name its greatest worth,"
4168,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Its gorgeous plumes and wings.
4169,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4170,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"But do not shun me thus, and hop"
4171,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Affrighted from my way.
4172,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Dismiss thy terrors--turn, and stop;"
4173,THE SPECKLED ONE.,And hear what I may say.
4174,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4175,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Meek, harmless thing, afraid of man?"
4176,THE SPECKLED ONE.,This truly should not be.
4177,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Then calmly pause, and let me scan"
4178,THE SPECKLED ONE.,My Maker's work in thee.
4179,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4180,THE SPECKLED ONE.,For both of us to him belong;
4181,THE SPECKLED ONE.,We 're fellow-creatures here;
4182,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"And power should not be armed with wrong,"
4183,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Nor weakness filled with fear.
4184,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4185,THE SPECKLED ONE.,I know it is thy humble lot
4186,THE SPECKLED ONE.,To burrow in a hole--
4187,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"To have a form I envy not,"
4188,THE SPECKLED ONE.,And that without a soul.
4189,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4190,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"In motion, attitude and limb"
4191,THE SPECKLED ONE.,I see thee void of grace;
4192,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"And that a look supremely grim,"
4193,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Reigns o'er thy solemn face.
4194,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4195,THE SPECKLED ONE.,But thou for this art not to blame;
4196,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Nor should it make us load
4197,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"With obloquy, and scorn, and shame"
4198,THE SPECKLED ONE.,The honest name of TOAD.
4199,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4200,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"For, though so low on nature's scale--"
4201,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"In presence so uncouth,"
4202,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Thou ne'er hast told an evil tale
4203,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Of falsehood, or of truth."
4204,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4205,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Thy thoughts are ne'er on malice bent--

4210,THE SPECKLED ONE.,No coveting nor envy burns
4211,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"In thy bright golden eye,"

4213,THE SPECKLED ONE.,On all below the sky.
4214,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4215,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Thy cautious tongue and sober lip
4216,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"No words of folly pass,"
4217,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Nor, are they found to taste and sip"
4218,THE SPECKLED ONE.,The madness of the glass.
4219,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4220,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Thy frugal meal is often drawn
4221,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"From earth, and wood, and stone;"

4224,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4225,THE SPECKLED ONE.,I hear that in an earthen jar
4226,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Sealed close, shut up alive,"
4227,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"From food, drink, air, sun, moon and star,"
4228,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Thou 'lt live and even thrive:
4229,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4230,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"And that no moan, or murmuring sound"
4231,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Will issue from the lid
4232,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Of thy dark dwelling under ground,"
4233,THE SPECKLED ONE.,When it is deeply hid.
4234,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4235,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Thou hast, as 't were, a secret shelf"
4236,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Whereon is a supply,"
4237,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Of nourishment within thyself,"
4238,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Concealed from mortal eye.
4239,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4240,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Methinks this self-sustaining art
4241,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"'T were well for us to know,"
4242,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"To keep us up in flesh and heart,"
4243,THE SPECKLED ONE.,When outer means grow low.
4244,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4245,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Could we contain our riches thus,"
4246,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"On such mysterious shelves,"
4247,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Why, none could rob or beggar us;"
4248,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Unless we lost ourselves!
4249,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4250,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"But ah! my Toadie, there 's the rub,"
4251,THE SPECKLED ONE.,With every human breast--
4252,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"To live as in the cynic's tub,"
4253,THE SPECKLED ONE.,And yet be self-possessed!
4254,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4255,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"For, how to let no boast get round"
4256,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Beyond our tub, to show"
4257,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"That we in head and heart are sound,"
4258,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Is one great thing to know.
4259,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4260,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"And yet, the prison-staves and hoop"
4261,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"To let no murmur through,"
4262,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"However hard we find the coop,"
4263,THE SPECKLED ONE.,Is greater still to do.
4264,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4265,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Then go, thou sage, resigned and calm;"
4266,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"Amid thy low estate,"
4267,THE SPECKLED ONE.,And to thy burrow bear the palm
4268,THE SPECKLED ONE.,For victory over fate.
4269,THE SPECKLED ONE.,
4270,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"We conquer, when we meekly bear"
4271,THE SPECKLED ONE.,"The lot we cannot shape,"
4272,THE SPECKLED ONE.,And hug to death the ills and care
4273,THE SPECKLED ONE.,From which there 's no escape.

4278,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.
4279,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4280,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4281,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Moon, thou art wading through the gathered snow,"
4282,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"That o'er us, on the fields of ether spread,"
4283,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Threatens, ere morning to be here below,"
4284,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,To lie where our poor mortal feet must tread.
4285,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4286,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Thy face is muffled in a gelid haze,"
4287,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,That shrouds its lustre like a frozen veil;
4288,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"And kills the twinkling of the starry rays,"
4289,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Till all on high looks cheerless, dim, and pale."
4290,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4291,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"It gives almost the ague, to behold"
4292,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"The skies so rayless, yet so far from dark;"
4293,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"As when our hearth's white ashes, tired and cold,"
4294,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,We stir in vain to find one pleasant spark.
4295,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4296,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Yet, by to-morrow's eve our parts may shift,"
4297,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"And thou be shining there, serene and clear,"
4298,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,While we are hedged by many a frigid drift;
4299,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,Or sleigh-bells shrill may pierce the tingling ear.
4300,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4301,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,How dreary then the scene for thy mild beams
4302,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"To light, and for the burning stars to view!"
4303,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"The hard ice coating all the lakes and streams,"
4304,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,And one dead white where late gay flowerets grew.
4305,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4306,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"The naked trees, that stand with buried feet,"
4307,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Like skeletons, will slender shadows throw"
4308,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"On what seems spread as nature's winding-sheet,"
4309,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,While her slain beauties lie concealed below.
4310,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4311,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Then, but to look abroad on vale and hill,"
4312,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Where one pale uniform invests the whole,"
4313,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Though it should make one's vital current chill,"
4314,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,It must not let in winter to the soul!
4315,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4316,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"It must not bring a frost upon the heart,"
4317,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"To kill affection's tendrils--friendship's root,"
4318,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Where vernal shoots and buds should ever start,"
4319,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,And grow with summer flowers and autumn fruit:
4320,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4321,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Nor cause the streams of thought to be congealed,"
4322,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Or, pressed beneath incumbent ice, grow low;"
4323,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"But, like the fount that irrigates the field,"
4324,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Make bloom and verdure spring, where'er they flow."
4325,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4326,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"It must not make our shrinking fancies flee,"
4327,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,Like birds of summer from the cold withdrawn;
4328,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"But wise, the mind should, like the prudent bee,"
4329,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"On honey banquet, though the flowers are gone."
4330,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4331,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Nor must it strike the hopeful spirit dumb,"
4332,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Or quench the beaming of her upturned eye,"
4333,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Or close her ear, or make her members numb,"
4334,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,Ere her thank-offerings on the altar lie.
4335,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4336,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"And yet, fair Moon, methinks I like the best"
4337,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"To see thy silvery lustre sprinkled here,"
4338,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"When these bare branches all appear full-dressed,"
4339,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,In some more gentle season of the year.
4340,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4341,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"I love to see it, mingled with the dew,"
4342,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,Falling to bathe the sleeping buds and flowers;
4343,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"And soft, and silent, coolly streaming through"
4344,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"The whispering leaves, that clothe the summer bowers."
4345,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4346,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,I love to see thy beaming mantle trail
4347,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Along the flower-sprent borders of the rill,"
4348,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"With rich, deep shadows stamped, o'erspread the vale,"
4349,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,Or bind the forehead of the silent hill.
4350,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4351,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"I love to see thee through the foliage peep,"
4352,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Where, one soft hour before, the robin sung"
4353,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Her vesper song; the while, in downy sleep,"
4354,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,With peaceful breast she guards her callow young.
4355,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4356,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"I love to see thee, when the whip-poor-will"
4357,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,Moans in the hedge behind the cottage-eaves;
4358,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"And when the plaintive crickets, hidden, trill"
4359,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,Their harvest-hymn among the golden sheaves.
4360,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4361,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"But these are tender memories--ay, and more--"
4362,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Fresh budding hope from memory's root that grows,"
4363,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"To see earth clothed in beauty as before,"
4364,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,When thou and we have struggled through the snows.
4365,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4366,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Then come, sweet Moon, and fondly smile on me,"
4367,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"From thy pure azure home, with face serene,"
4368,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"While I will look abroad, and up to thee,"
4369,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,And bless the great Creator of the scene.
4370,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4371,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Others may call thee fickle--faithless--strange,"
4372,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"When veiled in part, or wholly from their view;"
4373,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Yet, though twelve times a year thou _seems't_ to change,"
4374,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,Again twelve times I ever find thee true.
4375,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,
4376,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"'T is our gross planet, heaving misty shrouds,"
4377,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Or rolled before thee, that our darkness brings,"
4378,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,Just as earth's bulk or vapor hides or clouds
4379,THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT.,"Our glorious view of higher, holier things."

4386,TOM TAR.,
4387,TOM TAR.,"I 'll tell you now about Tom Tar,"
4388,TOM TAR.,"The sailor stout and bold,"
4389,TOM TAR.,"Who o'er the ocean roamed so far,"
4390,TOM TAR.,To countries new and old.
4391,TOM TAR.,
4392,TOM TAR.,Tom was a man of thousands; he
4393,TOM TAR.,"Would ne'er complain nor frown,"
4394,TOM TAR.,Though high and low the wind and sea
4395,TOM TAR.,Might toss him up and down.
4396,TOM TAR.,
4397,TOM TAR.,"Amid the waters dark and deep,"
4398,TOM TAR.,"He had the happy art,"
4399,TOM TAR.,"When all around was storm, to keep"
4400,TOM TAR.,Fair weather in his heart.
4401,TOM TAR.,
4402,TOM TAR.,"Though winds were wild, and waves were rough,"
4403,TOM TAR.,"He 'd always cast about,"
4404,TOM TAR.,And find within he 'd calm enough
4405,TOM TAR.,To stand the storms without.
4406,TOM TAR.,
4407,TOM TAR.,"""For naught,"" said Tom, ""is ever gained"
4408,TOM TAR.,By sighs for what we lack;
4409,TOM TAR.,"Nor can it mend a vessel strained,"
4410,TOM TAR.,To let our temper crack.
4411,TOM TAR.,
4412,TOM TAR.,"""And sure I am, the worst of storms,"
4413,TOM TAR.,"That any man should dread,"
4414,TOM TAR.,"Is that, which in the bosom forms,"
4415,TOM TAR.,"And musters to the head."""
4416,TOM TAR.,
4417,TOM TAR.,"Serene, and ever self-possessed,"
4418,TOM TAR.,"His mess-mates he would cheer,"
4419,TOM TAR.,"And often put their fears to rest,"
4420,TOM TAR.,When dangers gathered near.
4421,TOM TAR.,
4422,TOM TAR.,"If on the rocks the ship was cast,"
4423,TOM TAR.,"And surges swept the deck,"
4424,TOM TAR.,"Tom Tar was ever found the last,"
4425,TOM TAR.,Who would forsake the wreck.
4426,TOM TAR.,
4427,TOM TAR.,And when his only hat and shoes
4428,TOM TAR.,"The waters plucked from him,"
4429,TOM TAR.,"Why, these, he felt, were small to lose,"
4430,TOM TAR.,Could he keep up and swim!
4431,TOM TAR.,
4432,TOM TAR.,"Then through the billows, foam, and spray,"
4433,TOM TAR.,"That rose on every hand,"
4434,TOM TAR.,"He 'd, somehow, always find a way"
4435,TOM TAR.,Of getting safe to land.
4436,TOM TAR.,
4437,TOM TAR.,"The secret was, the fear and love"
4438,TOM TAR.,Of Heaven had filled his soul:
4439,TOM TAR.,"His trust was firm in One above,"
4440,TOM TAR.,Howe'er the seas might roll.
4441,TOM TAR.,
4442,TOM TAR.,"And Tom had sailed to many a shore,"
4443,TOM TAR.,And many a wonder seen:
4444,TOM TAR.,The stories he could tell would more
4445,TOM TAR.,Than fill a magazine.
4446,TOM TAR.,
4447,TOM TAR.,"He 'd seen mankind in every state,"
4448,TOM TAR.,"Almost, that man can know;"
4449,TOM TAR.,"But envied not the rich and great,"
4450,TOM TAR.,Nor scorned the poor and low.
4451,TOM TAR.,
4452,TOM TAR.,"The monarch in his sight had stood,"
4453,TOM TAR.,"Superb, in glittering vest;"
4454,TOM TAR.,"The savage, too, that roams the wood,"
4455,TOM TAR.,In skins and feathers dressed.
4456,TOM TAR.,
4457,TOM TAR.,The tribes of many an isle he knew;
4458,TOM TAR.,"And beasts, and birds, and flowers,"
4459,TOM TAR.,"And fruits, of many a shape and hue,"
4460,TOM TAR.,In lands remote from ours.
4461,TOM TAR.,
4462,TOM TAR.,He 'd seen the wide-winged albatross
4463,TOM TAR.,Her breast in ocean lave;
4464,TOM TAR.,"And bold sea-lions, playing, toss"
4465,TOM TAR.,Their heads above the wave.
4466,TOM TAR.,
4467,TOM TAR.,"He 'd seen the dolphin, while his back"
4468,TOM TAR.,"Went flashing to the sun,"
4469,TOM TAR.,"A swarm of flying fish attack,"
4470,TOM TAR.,And swallow every one!
4471,TOM TAR.,
4472,TOM TAR.,The porpoise and the spouting whale
4473,TOM TAR.,Had sported in his view;
4474,TOM TAR.,"And hungry sharks pursued his sail,"
4475,TOM TAR.,As if they 'd eat the crew.
4476,TOM TAR.,
4477,TOM TAR.,"And ever, when Tom Tar got home,"
4478,TOM TAR.,"The children, at their play,"
4479,TOM TAR.,"Were glad to have the sailor come,"
4480,TOM TAR.,And greet them by the way.
4481,TOM TAR.,
4482,TOM TAR.,"Then, oft, some curious stone, or shell,"
4483,TOM TAR.,The laughing girls and boys
4484,TOM TAR.,"Would find, that on their aprons fell,"
4485,TOM TAR.,To put among their toys.
4486,TOM TAR.,
4487,TOM TAR.,"""These pearly shells,"" said he, ""I found"
4488,TOM TAR.,Where gloomy waters roar:
4489,TOM TAR.,"These polished stones, so smooth and round,"
4490,TOM TAR.,Rough surges washed ashore.
4491,TOM TAR.,
4492,TOM TAR.,"""Though small to us a pebble seems,"
4493,TOM TAR.,"'T is made and marked by One,"
4494,TOM TAR.,"Who gave the warmth, and lit the beams"
4495,TOM TAR.,Of yon great shining sun.
4496,TOM TAR.,
4497,TOM TAR.,"""And when these pretty shells I find,"
4498,TOM TAR.,"Along the ocean strand,"
4499,TOM TAR.,Their beauteous finish brings to mind
4500,TOM TAR.,Their Maker's perfect hand.
4501,TOM TAR.,
4502,TOM TAR.,"""When on the wildest shore I'm thrown,"
4503,TOM TAR.,"And far from human eye,"
4504,TOM TAR.,"I think of him who made the stone,"
4505,TOM TAR.,"And shell, and sea, and sky."
4506,TOM TAR.,
4507,TOM TAR.,"""For he 's my friend, and I am his,"
4508,TOM TAR.,Though cold and rough the blast:
4509,TOM TAR.,"My safest guide I know he is,"
4510,TOM TAR.,"Where'er my lot is cast."""

6136,MUSIC.,"Of Love and Joy, he made their spirits one;"
6137,MUSIC.,"And her, the heir to everlasting life!"
6138,MUSIC.,"When his bright hosts would give him highest praise,"
6139,MUSIC.,"They send her forward with her dulcet voice,"
6140,MUSIC.,To pour their holy rapture in his ear.
6141,MUSIC.,"When the young earth to being started forth,"

6143,MUSIC.,"A crystal fountain, close beside her, gushed"
6144,MUSIC.,With living waters; and the sparkling cup
6145,MUSIC.,"For her pure draught, stood on its emerald brink."
6146,MUSIC.,"While o'er her brow a tender halo shone,"
6147,MUSIC.,"Kissed by the nodding buds, her head reclined"
6148,MUSIC.,"Upon a flowery pillow. At her ear,"
6149,MUSIC.,The soft leaves whispered. On her half-closed lips
6150,MUSIC.,"The gentle air strewed spices, wooing them."
6151,MUSIC.,"Dropped o'er its radiant orb, the long-fringed lid"
6152,MUSIC.,Veiled the deep inspiration of her eye;
6153,MUSIC.,"But on her cheek the rose-tint came and went,"
6154,MUSIC.,"At the quick pulse that fluttered in her breast,"
6155,MUSIC.,"And spoke a wakeful spirit. In her sleep,"
6156,MUSIC.,"With one fair hand thrown o'er its silent strings,"
6157,MUSIC.,"Close to her heart she clasped her golden lyre,"

6182,MUSIC.,Beside the silver waters pour her sounds;
6183,MUSIC.,And multiply her numbers by the rocks!
6184,MUSIC.,She longed to give it voice to speak to God;
6185,MUSIC.,"And, being told of her blest ministry,"
6186,MUSIC.,"Bathed in a flood of glory, till her wings"
6187,MUSIC.,"Dripped with effulgence, as they spread, and poised,"
6188,MUSIC.,And passed the pearly gates in earthward flight.
6189,MUSIC.,"Made viewless by the circumambient air,"
6190,MUSIC.,"And scattering voices to its feathered tribes,"
6191,MUSIC.,"As down she hastened to the shining sphere,"
6192,MUSIC.,The happy angel reached the beauteous earth.
6193,MUSIC.,"At her electric touch, young nature smiled,"
6194,MUSIC.,And kindled into rapture; then broke forth
6195,MUSIC.,"With thousand, thousand songs."
6196,MUSIC.,The green turf woke;
6197,MUSIC.,"The sea-shells hummed along the vocal shore,"
6198,MUSIC.,"The busy bee, upon his honeyed flower."
6199,MUSIC.,Osier and reed became Eolian lyres.
6200,MUSIC.,"Trees bore sweet minstrels; while rock, hill, and dell"
6201,MUSIC.,Sang to each other in a joyous round.
6202,MUSIC.,"MAN, that mysterious instrument of God,"
6203,MUSIC.,When the warm soul of new-descended power
6204,MUSIC.,"Breathed on his heart-strings, lifted up his voice,"
6205,MUSIC.,"Chanting, ""JEHOVAH!"""
6206,MUSIC.,"Since that blessed hour,"
6207,MUSIC.,"While still her home is heaven, Music has ne'er"
6208,MUSIC.,"This darkened world forsaken. She delights,"
6209,MUSIC.,"Though man may lose, or keep the paths of peace,"
6210,MUSIC.,"To soothe, to cheer, to light and warm his heart;"
6211,MUSIC.,And lends her wings to waft it to the skies.
6212,MUSIC.,She throws a lustre o'er Devotion's face--
6213,MUSIC.,Drinks off the tear from Sorrow's languid eye--
6214,MUSIC.,Tames wild Despair--brings Hope a brighter bloom--
6215,MUSIC.,Lulls Hate to rest--Love's ruffled bosom smooths;
6216,MUSIC.,Pours honey into many a bitter cup;
6217,MUSIC.,And often gives the black and heavy hour
6218,MUSIC.,A downy breast and pinions tipped with light.
6219,MUSIC.,"She steals all balmy through the prisoner's grates,"
6220,MUSIC.,Making that sad one half forget their use.
6221,MUSIC.,"With holy spell she binds the exile's heart,"
6222,MUSIC.,And pours her oil upon its hidden wounds.
6223,MUSIC.,Kings are her lovers--cottagers her loves:
6224,MUSIC.,The hero and the pilgrim walk with her.
6225,MUSIC.,"Her voice is sweet by cradled infancy,"
6226,MUSIC.,"And from the pillow of the dying saint,"
6227,MUSIC.,When a glad spirit borrows her light wings
6228,MUSIC.,"To practise for the skies, ere it unfolds"
6229,MUSIC.,"Its own, and breaks its tenure to the clay."
6230,MUSIC.,"True, by man's wanderings for his tempter's lure,"
6231,MUSIC.,Music is often drawn to scenes unmeet
6232,MUSIC.,For purity like hers; and made to bear
6233,MUSIC.,"Unhallowed burdens; or, to join in rites"
6234,MUSIC.,To turpitude in fellest places held.
6235,MUSIC.,"Yet, like the sun, whose beaming vesture, trailed"
6236,MUSIC.,"O'er all things staining, still defies a stain;"
6237,MUSIC.,"And is at night withdrawn, and girded up,"
6238,MUSIC.,Warm and untarnished for the morning skies--
6239,MUSIC.,"She comes unsullied from her baser walks,"
6240,MUSIC.,"Sighs at the darkness, guilt and wo of earth;"
6241,MUSIC.,"Breathes Zion's air, and, warmed with heavenly fire,"
6242,MUSIC.,Mounts to her glorious home!
6243,MUSIC.,"'T was she, who bore"
6244,MUSIC.,"The first grand offering of the free, on high,"
6245,MUSIC.,"When to the shore, through Egypt's solemn sea,"
6246,MUSIC.,"The franchised Hebrews passed with feet dry-shod,"
6247,MUSIC.,And pÃ¦ans gave to their Deliverer there.
6248,MUSIC.,She cheered the wanderers on; and when they crossed
6249,MUSIC.,"Over old Jordan, to the strong-armed foe,"
6250,MUSIC.,Still she was with them; and her single breath
6251,MUSIC.,Laid the proud Painim's city-walls in dust!
6252,MUSIC.,"In native light, she walked Judea's hills,"
6253,MUSIC.,And sipped the dew of Hermon from its flower
6254,MUSIC.,Before the Sun of righteousness arose.
6255,MUSIC.,"The Prophet chose her to unseal his lips,"
6256,MUSIC.,"Ere God spake through them; and the Prophetess,"
6257,MUSIC.,To lift the heart's pure gift from her's to Heaven.
6258,MUSIC.,"When Israel's king was troubled, her soft hand"
6259,MUSIC.,"Put close, but gently, to his gloomy breast,"
6260,MUSIC.,"Reached the dark spirit there, and laid it still,"
6261,MUSIC.,Bound by the chords a shepherd minstrel swept.
6262,MUSIC.,"And since, her countless thousands she has brought"
6263,MUSIC.,"To heaven's mild kingdom, happy captives led,"
6264,MUSIC.,By those sweet glowing strings of David's lyre.
6265,MUSIC.,"But oh! her richest, dearest notes to man,"
6266,MUSIC.,"In strains aerial over Bethlehem poured,"
6267,MUSIC.,"When HE, whose brightness is the light of heaven,"
6268,MUSIC.,"To earth descending for a mortal's form,"
6269,MUSIC.,"Laid by his glory, save one radiant mark,"
6270,MUSIC.,"That moved through space, and o'er the infant hung,"
6271,MUSIC.,"He summoned Music to attend him here,"
6272,MUSIC.,Announcing peace below!

6274,MUSIC.,"To sweeten that sad supper, and to twine"
6275,MUSIC.,"Her mantle round him, and his few, grieved friends"
6276,MUSIC.,"To join their mournful spirits with the hymn,"
6277,MUSIC.,Ere to the Mount of Olives he went out
6278,MUSIC.,So sorrowful.
6279,MUSIC.,"And now, his blessed word,"
6280,MUSIC.,"A sacred pledge, is left to dying man,"
6281,MUSIC.,"Then at his second coming in his power,"
