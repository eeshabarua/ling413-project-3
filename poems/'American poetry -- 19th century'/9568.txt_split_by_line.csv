177,THE FROST SPIRIT,
178,THE FROST SPIRIT,"He comes,--he comes,--the Frost Spirit comes"
179,THE FROST SPIRIT,You may trace his footsteps now
180,THE FROST SPIRIT,On the naked woods and the blasted fields and the
181,THE FROST SPIRIT,brown hill's withered brow.
182,THE FROST SPIRIT,He has smitten the leaves of the gray old trees
183,THE FROST SPIRIT,"where their pleasant green came forth,"
184,THE FROST SPIRIT,"And the winds, which follow wherever he goes,"
185,THE FROST SPIRIT,have shaken them down to earth.
186,THE FROST SPIRIT,
187,THE FROST SPIRIT,"He comes,--he comes,--the Frost Spirit comes!"
188,THE FROST SPIRIT,"from the frozen Labrador,"
189,THE FROST SPIRIT,"From the icy bridge of the Northern seas, which"
190,THE FROST SPIRIT,"the white bear wanders o'er,"
191,THE FROST SPIRIT,"Where the fisherman's sail is stiff with ice, and the"
192,THE FROST SPIRIT,luckless forms below
193,THE FROST SPIRIT,In the sunless cold of the lingering night into
194,THE FROST SPIRIT,marble statues grow
195,THE FROST SPIRIT,
196,THE FROST SPIRIT,"He comes,--he comes,--the Frost Spirit comes"
197,THE FROST SPIRIT,"on the rushing Northern blast,"
198,THE FROST SPIRIT,And the dark Norwegian pines have bowed as his
199,THE FROST SPIRIT,fearful breath went past.
200,THE FROST SPIRIT,"With an unscorched wing he has hurried on,"
201,THE FROST SPIRIT,where the fires of Hecla glow
202,THE FROST SPIRIT,On the darkly beautiful sky above and the ancient
203,THE FROST SPIRIT,ice below.
204,THE FROST SPIRIT,
205,THE FROST SPIRIT,"He comes,--he comes,--the Frost Spirit comes"
206,THE FROST SPIRIT,and the quiet lake shall feel
207,THE FROST SPIRIT,"The torpid touch of his glazing breath, and ring to"
208,THE FROST SPIRIT,the skater's heel;
209,THE FROST SPIRIT,And the streams which danced on the broken
210,THE FROST SPIRIT,"rocks, or sang to the leaning grass,"
211,THE FROST SPIRIT,"Shall bow again to their winter chain, and in"
212,THE FROST SPIRIT,mournful silence pass.
213,THE FROST SPIRIT,"He comes,--he comes,--the Frost Spirit comes!"
214,THE FROST SPIRIT,"Let us meet him as we may,"
215,THE FROST SPIRIT,And turn with the light of the parlor-fire his evil
216,THE FROST SPIRIT,power away;
217,THE FROST SPIRIT,"And gather closer the circle round, when that"
218,THE FROST SPIRIT,"fire-light dances high,"
219,THE FROST SPIRIT,And laugh at the shriek of the baffled Fiend as
220,THE FROST SPIRIT,his sounding wing goes by!

226,THE MERRIMAC.,
227,THE MERRIMAC.,"""The Indians speak of a beautiful river, far to the south,"
228,THE MERRIMAC.,"which they call Merrimac.""--SIEUR. DE MONTS, 1604."
229,THE MERRIMAC.,
230,THE MERRIMAC.,Stream of my fathers! sweetly still
231,THE MERRIMAC.,The sunset rays thy valley fill;
232,THE MERRIMAC.,"Poured slantwise down the long defile,"
233,THE MERRIMAC.,"Wave, wood, and spire beneath them smile."
234,THE MERRIMAC.,I see the winding Powow fold
235,THE MERRIMAC.,"The green hill in its belt of gold,"
236,THE MERRIMAC.,"And following down its wavy line,"
237,THE MERRIMAC.,Its sparkling waters blend with thine.
238,THE MERRIMAC.,"There 's not a tree upon thy side,"
239,THE MERRIMAC.,"Nor rock, which thy returning tide"
240,THE MERRIMAC.,As yet hath left abrupt and stark
241,THE MERRIMAC.,Above thy evening water-mark;
242,THE MERRIMAC.,"No calm cove with its rocky hem,"
243,THE MERRIMAC.,No isle whose emerald swells begin
244,THE MERRIMAC.,"Thy broad, smooth current; not a sail"
245,THE MERRIMAC.,Bowed to the freshening ocean gale;
246,THE MERRIMAC.,"No small boat with its busy oars,"
247,THE MERRIMAC.,Nor gray wall sloping to thy shores;
248,THE MERRIMAC.,"Nor farm-house with its maple shade,"
249,THE MERRIMAC.,"Or rigid poplar colonnade,"
250,THE MERRIMAC.,"But lies distinct and full in sight,"
251,THE MERRIMAC.,Beneath this gush of sunset light.
252,THE MERRIMAC.,"Centuries ago, that harbor-bar,"
253,THE MERRIMAC.,"Stretching its length of foam afar,"
254,THE MERRIMAC.,"And Salisbury's beach of shining sand,"
255,THE MERRIMAC.,"And yonder island's wave-smoothed strand,"
256,THE MERRIMAC.,"Saw the adventurer's tiny sail,"
257,THE MERRIMAC.,"Flit, stooping from the eastern gale;"
258,THE MERRIMAC.,And o'er these woods and waters broke
259,THE MERRIMAC.,"The cheer from Britain's hearts of oak,"
260,THE MERRIMAC.,"As brightly on the voyager's eye,"
261,THE MERRIMAC.,"Weary of forest, sea, and sky,"
262,THE MERRIMAC.,"Breaking the dull continuous wood,"
263,THE MERRIMAC.,The Merrimac rolled down his flood;
264,THE MERRIMAC.,"Mingling that clear pellucid brook,"
265,THE MERRIMAC.,Which channels vast Agioochook
266,THE MERRIMAC.,When spring-time's sun and shower unlock
267,THE MERRIMAC.,"The frozen fountains of the rock,"
268,THE MERRIMAC.,And more abundant waters given
269,THE MERRIMAC.,"From that pure lake, ""The Smile of Heaven,"""
270,THE MERRIMAC.,"Tributes from vale and mountain-side,--"
271,THE MERRIMAC.,"With ocean's dark, eternal tide!"
272,THE MERRIMAC.,
273,THE MERRIMAC.,"On yonder rocky cape, which braves"
274,THE MERRIMAC.,"The stormy challenge of the waves,"
275,THE MERRIMAC.,"Midst tangled vine and dwarfish wood,"
276,THE MERRIMAC.,"The hardy Anglo-Saxon stood,"
277,THE MERRIMAC.,Planting upon the topmost crag
278,THE MERRIMAC.,The staff of England's battle-flag;
279,THE MERRIMAC.,"And, while from out its heavy fold"
280,THE MERRIMAC.,"Saint George's crimson cross unrolled,"
281,THE MERRIMAC.,"Midst roll of drum and trumpet blare,"
282,THE MERRIMAC.,"And weapons brandishing in air,"
283,THE MERRIMAC.,He gave to that lone promontory
284,THE MERRIMAC.,The sweetest name in all his story;
285,THE MERRIMAC.,"Of her, the flower of Islam's daughters,"
286,THE MERRIMAC.,"Whose harems look on Stamboul's waters,--"
287,THE MERRIMAC.,"Who, when the chance of war had bound"
288,THE MERRIMAC.,"The Moslem chain his limbs around,"
289,THE MERRIMAC.,"Wreathed o'er with silk that iron chain,"
290,THE MERRIMAC.,"Soothed with her smiles his hours of pain,"
291,THE MERRIMAC.,And fondly to her youthful slave
292,THE MERRIMAC.,A dearer gift than freedom gave.
293,THE MERRIMAC.,
294,THE MERRIMAC.,But look! the yellow light no more
295,THE MERRIMAC.,Streams down on wave and verdant shore;
296,THE MERRIMAC.,And clearly on the calm air swells
297,THE MERRIMAC.,The twilight voice of distant bells.
298,THE MERRIMAC.,"From Ocean's bosom, white and thin,"
299,THE MERRIMAC.,The mists come slowly rolling in;
300,THE MERRIMAC.,"Hills, woods, the river's rocky rim,"
301,THE MERRIMAC.,"Amidst the sea--like vapor swim,"
302,THE MERRIMAC.,"While yonder lonely coast-light, set"
303,THE MERRIMAC.,"Within its wave-washed minaret,"
304,THE MERRIMAC.,"Half quenched, a beamless star and pale,"
305,THE MERRIMAC.,Shines dimly through its cloudy veil!
306,THE MERRIMAC.,
307,THE MERRIMAC.,Home of my fathers!--I have stood
308,THE MERRIMAC.,Where Hudson rolled his lordly flood
309,THE MERRIMAC.,Seen sunrise rest and sunset fade
310,THE MERRIMAC.,Along his frowning Palisade;
311,THE MERRIMAC.,Looked down the Appalachian peak
312,THE MERRIMAC.,On Juniata's silver streak;
313,THE MERRIMAC.,Have seen along his valley gleam
314,THE MERRIMAC.,The Mohawk's softly winding stream;
315,THE MERRIMAC.,The level light of sunset shine
316,THE MERRIMAC.,Through broad Potomac's hem of pine;
317,THE MERRIMAC.,And autumn's rainbow-tinted banner
318,THE MERRIMAC.,Hang lightly o'er the Susquehanna;
319,THE MERRIMAC.,"Yet wheresoe'er his step might be,"
320,THE MERRIMAC.,Thy wandering child looked back to thee!
321,THE MERRIMAC.,Heard in his dreams thy river's sound
322,THE MERRIMAC.,"Of murmuring on its pebbly bound,"
323,THE MERRIMAC.,The unforgotten swell and roar
324,THE MERRIMAC.,Of waves on thy familiar shore;
325,THE MERRIMAC.,"And saw, amidst the curtained gloom"
326,THE MERRIMAC.,"And quiet of his lonely room,"
327,THE MERRIMAC.,Thy sunset scenes before him pass;
328,THE MERRIMAC.,"As, in Agrippa's magic glass,"
329,THE MERRIMAC.,"The loved and lost arose to view,"
330,THE MERRIMAC.,"Remembered groves in greenness grew,"
331,THE MERRIMAC.,"Bathed still in childhood's morning dew,"
332,THE MERRIMAC.,Along whose bowers of beauty swept
333,THE MERRIMAC.,"Whatever Memory's mourners wept,"
334,THE MERRIMAC.,"Sweet faces, which the charnel kept,"
335,THE MERRIMAC.,"Young, gentle eyes, which long had slept;"
336,THE MERRIMAC.,"And while the gazer leaned to trace,"
337,THE MERRIMAC.,"More near, some dear familiar face,"
338,THE MERRIMAC.,"He wept to find the vision flown,--"
339,THE MERRIMAC.,A phantom and a dream alone!

344,HAMPTON BEACH,HAMPTON BEACH
345,HAMPTON BEACH,
346,HAMPTON BEACH,"The sunlight glitters keen and bright,"
347,HAMPTON BEACH,"Where, miles away,"
348,HAMPTON BEACH,Lies stretching to my dazzled sight
349,HAMPTON BEACH,"A luminous belt, a misty light,"
350,HAMPTON BEACH,Beyond the dark pine bluffs and wastes of sandy gray.
351,HAMPTON BEACH,
352,HAMPTON BEACH,The tremulous shadow of the Sea!
353,HAMPTON BEACH,Against its ground
354,HAMPTON BEACH,"Of silvery light, rock, hill, and tree,"
355,HAMPTON BEACH,"Still as a picture, clear and free,"
356,HAMPTON BEACH,With varying outline mark the coast for miles around.
357,HAMPTON BEACH,
358,HAMPTON BEACH,On--on--we tread with loose-flung rein
359,HAMPTON BEACH,"Our seaward way,"
360,HAMPTON BEACH,"Through dark-green fields and blossoming grain,"
361,HAMPTON BEACH,"Where the wild brier-rose skirts the lane,"
362,HAMPTON BEACH,And bends above our heads the flowering locust spray.
363,HAMPTON BEACH,
364,HAMPTON BEACH,Ha! like a kind hand on my brow
365,HAMPTON BEACH,"Comes this fresh breeze,"
366,HAMPTON BEACH,"Cooling its dull and feverish glow,"
367,HAMPTON BEACH,While through my being seems to flow
368,HAMPTON BEACH,"The breath of a new life, the healing of the seas!"
369,HAMPTON BEACH,
370,HAMPTON BEACH,"Now rest we, where this grassy mound"
371,HAMPTON BEACH,His feet hath set
372,HAMPTON BEACH,"In the great waters, which have bound"
373,HAMPTON BEACH,His granite ankles greenly round
374,HAMPTON BEACH,"With long and tangled moss, and weeds with cool spray wet."
375,HAMPTON BEACH,
376,HAMPTON BEACH,Good-by to Pain and Care! I take
377,HAMPTON BEACH,Mine ease to-day
378,HAMPTON BEACH,"Here where these sunny waters break,"
379,HAMPTON BEACH,"And ripples this keen breeze, I shake"
380,HAMPTON BEACH,"All burdens from the heart, all weary thoughts away."
381,HAMPTON BEACH,
382,HAMPTON BEACH,"I draw a freer breath, I seem"
383,HAMPTON BEACH,Like all I see--
384,HAMPTON BEACH,"Waves in the sun, the white-winged gleam"
385,HAMPTON BEACH,"Of sea-birds in the slanting beam,"
386,HAMPTON BEACH,And far-off sails which flit before the south-wind free.
387,HAMPTON BEACH,
388,HAMPTON BEACH,"So when Time's veil shall fall asunder,"
389,HAMPTON BEACH,The soul may know
390,HAMPTON BEACH,"No fearful change, nor sudden wonder,"
391,HAMPTON BEACH,"Nor sink the weight of mystery under,"
392,HAMPTON BEACH,"But with the upward rise, and with the vastness grow."
393,HAMPTON BEACH,
394,HAMPTON BEACH,And all we shrink from now may seem
395,HAMPTON BEACH,No new revealing;
396,HAMPTON BEACH,"Familiar as our childhood's stream,"
397,HAMPTON BEACH,Or pleasant memory of a dream
398,HAMPTON BEACH,The loved and cherished Past upon the new life stealing.
399,HAMPTON BEACH,
400,HAMPTON BEACH,Serene and mild the untried light
401,HAMPTON BEACH,May have its dawning;
402,HAMPTON BEACH,"And, as in summer's northern night"
403,HAMPTON BEACH,"The evening and the dawn unite,"
404,HAMPTON BEACH,The sunset hues of Time blend with the soul's new morning.
405,HAMPTON BEACH,
406,HAMPTON BEACH,I sit alone; in foam and spray
407,HAMPTON BEACH,Wave after wave
408,HAMPTON BEACH,"Breaks on the rocks which, stern and gray,"
409,HAMPTON BEACH,"Shoulder the broken tide away,"
410,HAMPTON BEACH,Or murmurs hoarse and strong through mossy cleft and cave.
411,HAMPTON BEACH,
412,HAMPTON BEACH,What heed I of the dusty land
413,HAMPTON BEACH,And noisy town?
414,HAMPTON BEACH,I see the mighty deep expand
415,HAMPTON BEACH,From its white line of glimmering sand
416,HAMPTON BEACH,To where the blue of heaven on bluer waves shuts down!
417,HAMPTON BEACH,
418,HAMPTON BEACH,"In listless quietude of mind,"
419,HAMPTON BEACH,I yield to all
420,HAMPTON BEACH,The change of cloud and wave and wind
421,HAMPTON BEACH,"And passive on the flood reclined,"
422,HAMPTON BEACH,"I wander with the waves, and with them rise and fall."
423,HAMPTON BEACH,
424,HAMPTON BEACH,"But look, thou dreamer! wave and shore"
425,HAMPTON BEACH,In shadow lie;
426,HAMPTON BEACH,The night-wind warns me back once more
427,HAMPTON BEACH,"To where, my native hill-tops o'er,"
428,HAMPTON BEACH,Bends like an arch of fire the glowing sunset sky.
429,HAMPTON BEACH,
430,HAMPTON BEACH,"So then, beach, bluff, and wave, farewell!"
431,HAMPTON BEACH,I bear with me
432,HAMPTON BEACH,"No token stone nor glittering shell,"
433,HAMPTON BEACH,But long and oft shall Memory tell
434,HAMPTON BEACH,Of this brief thoughtful hour of musing by the Sea.
