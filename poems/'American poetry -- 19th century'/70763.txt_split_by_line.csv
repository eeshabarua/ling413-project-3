469,XII.,XII.
470,XII.,
471,XII.,But all by turns and nothing long;
472,XII.,"And Rose, whose needle gains her bread;"
473,XII.,"And bookish Sibyl,—she whose tongue"
474,XII.,The bees of Hybla must have fed;
475,XII.,And one—a poet—nowise sage
476,XII.,"For self, but gay companion boon"
477,XII.,And prophet of the golden age;
478,XII.,He joined us in our pilgrimage
479,XII.,"Long since, one early Autumn noon"
480,XII.,"When, faint with journeying, we sate"
481,XII.,Within a wayside hostel-gate
482,XII.,To rest us in Bohemia.
483,XII.,
484,XII.,
485,XIII.,XIII.
486,XIII.,
487,XIII.,"In rusty garb, but with an air"
488,XIII.,"Of grace, that hunger could not whelm,"
489,XIII.,"He told his wants, and—“Could we spare"
490,XIII.,Aught of the current of the realm—
491,XIII.,A shilling?”—which I gave; and so
492,XIII.,"Came talk, and Blanche’s kindly smile;"
493,XIII.,"Whereat he felt his heart aglow,"
494,XIII.,"And said: “Lo, here is silver! lo,"
495,XIII.,"Mine host hath ale! and it were vile,"
496,XIII.,If so much coin were spent by me
497,XIII.,"For bread, when such good company"
498,XIII.,Is gathered in Bohemia.”
499,XIII.,
500,XIII.,
501,XIV.,XIV.
502,XIV.,
503,XIV.,"Richer than Kaiser on his throne,"
504,XIV.,A royal stoup he bade them bring;
505,XIV.,"And so, with many of mine own,"
506,XIV.,His shilling vanished on the wing;
507,XIV.,And many a skyward-floating strain
508,XIV.,"He sang, we chorusing the lay"
509,XIV.,Till all the hostel rang again;
510,XIV.,"But when the day began to wane,"
511,XIV.,Along the sequel of our way
512,XIV.,"He kept us pace; and, since that time,"
513,XIV.,We never lack for song and rhyme
514,XIV.,"To cheer us, in Bohemia."
515,XIV.,
516,XIV.,
517,XV.,XV.
518,XV.,
519,XV.,"And once we stopped a twelvemonth, where"
520,XV.,Five-score Bohemians began
521,XV.,"Their scheme to cheapen bed and fare,"
522,XV.,Upon a late-discovered plan;
523,XV.,"“For see,” they said, “the sum how small"
524,XV.,By which one pilgrim’s wants are met!
525,XV.,"And if a host together fall,"
526,XV.,What need of any cash at all?”
527,XV.,"Though how it worked I half forget,"
528,XV.,Yet still the same old dance and song
529,XV.,"We found,—the kindly, blithesome throng"
530,XV.,And joyance of Bohemia.
531,XV.,
532,XV.,
533,XVI.,XVI.
534,XVI.,
535,XVI.,"Thus onward through the Magic Land,"
536,XVI.,With varying chance. But once there past
537,XVI.,"A mystic shadow o’er our band,"
538,XVI.,"Deeper than Want could ever cast,"
539,XVI.,"For, oh, it darkened little eyes!"
540,XVI.,"We saw our youngest darling die,"
541,XVI.,"Then robed her in her palmer’s guise,"
542,XVI.,"And crossed the fair hands pilgrim-wise,"
543,XVI.,"And, one by one, so tenderly,"
544,XVI.,"Came Ambrose, Sibyl, Ralph, and Rose,"
545,XVI.,Strewing each sweetest flower that grows
546,XVI.,In wildwoods of Bohemia.

550,XVII.,
551,XVII.,"But last the Poet, sorrowing, stood"
552,XVII.,"Above the tiny clay, and said:"
553,XVII.,"“Bright little Spirit, pure and good,"
554,XVII.,Whither so far away hast fled?
555,XVII.,Full soon thou tryest that other sphere:
556,XVII.,Whate’er is lacking in our lives
557,XVII.,"Thou dost attain; for Heaven is near,"
558,XVII.,"Methinks, to pilgrims wandering here,"
559,XVII.,As to that one who never strives
560,XVII.,"With fortune,—has not come to know"
561,XVII.,The pride and pain that dwell so low
562,XVII.,In valleys of Bohemia.”
563,XVII.,
564,XVII.,
565,XVIII.,XVIII.
566,XVIII.,
567,XVIII.,"He ceased, and pointed solemnly"
568,XVIII.,Through western windows; and we saw
569,XVIII.,That lustrous castle of the sky
570,XVIII.,"Gleam, touched with flame; and heard with awe,"
571,XVIII.,"About us, gentle whisperings"
572,XVIII.,Of unseen watchers hovering near
573,XVIII.,"Our dead, and rustling angel wings!"
574,XVIII.,"Now, whether this or that year brings"
575,XVIII.,"The valley’s end, or, haply, here"
576,XVIII.,"Our pilgrimage for life must last,"
577,XVIII.,We know not; but a sacred past

581,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.
582,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
583,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"O love! Love! Love! what times were those,"
584,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Long ere the age of belles and beaux
585,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And Brussels lace and silken hose,"
586,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"When, in the green Arcadian close,"
587,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"You married Psyche, under the rose,"
588,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,With only the grass for bedding!
589,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Heart to heart, and hand in hand,"
590,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,You followed Nature’s sweet command—
591,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Roaming lovingly through the land,"
592,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Nor sighed for a Diamond Wedding.
593,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
594,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"So have we read, in classic Ovid,"
595,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"How Hero watched for her beloved,"
596,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Impassioned youth, Leander."
597,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"She was the fairest of the fair,"
598,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And wrapt him round with her golden hair,"
599,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Whenever he landed cold and bare,"
600,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,With nothing to eat and nothing to wear
601,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And wetter than any gander;
602,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"For Love was Love, and better than money;"
603,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"The slyer the theft, the sweeter the honey;"
604,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And kissing was clover, all the world over,"
605,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Wherever Cupid might wander.
606,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
607,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"So thousands of years have come and gone,"
608,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And still the moon is shining on,"
609,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Still Hymen’s torch is lighted;
610,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And hitherto, in this land of the West,"
611,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Most couples in love have thought it best
612,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"To follow the ancient way of the rest,"
613,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And quietly get united.
614,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
615,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"But now, True Love, you’re growing old—"
616,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Bought and sold, with silver and gold,"
617,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Like a house, or a horse and carriage!"
618,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Midnight talks,"
619,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Moonlight walks,"
620,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"The glance of the eye and sweetheart sigh,"
621,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"The shadowy haunts with no one by,"
622,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,I do not wish to disparage;
623,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,But every kiss
624,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Has a price for its bliss,"
625,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,In the modern code of marriage;
626,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And the compact sweet
627,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Is not complete,"
628,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Till the high contracting parties meet
629,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Before the altar of Mammon;
630,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And the bride must be led to a silver bower,"
631,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Where pearls and rubies fall in a shower
632,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,That would frighten Jupiter Ammon!
633,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
634,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,I need not tell
635,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"How it befell,"
636,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,(Since Jenkins has told the story
637,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Over and over and over again,"
638,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"In a style I cannot hope to attain,"
639,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And covered himself with glory!)
640,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"How it befell, one Summer’s day,"
641,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"The King of the Cubans strolled this way,—"
642,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"King January’s his name, they say,—"
643,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And fell in love with the Princess May,"
644,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,The reigning belle of Manhattan;
645,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Nor how he began to smirk and sue,"
646,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And dress as lovers who come to woo,"
647,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Or as Max Maretzek and Jullien do,"
648,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"When they sit, full-bloomed, in the ladies’ view,"
649,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And flourish the wondrous baton.
650,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
651,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"He wasn’t one of your Polish nobles,"
652,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Whose presence their country somehow troubles,"
653,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And so our cities receive them;
654,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Nor one of your make-believe Spanish grandees,"
655,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Who ply our daughters with lies and candies,"
656,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Until the poor girls believe them.
657,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"No, he was no such charlatan—"
658,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Count de Hoboken Flash-in-the-pan,"
659,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Full of gasconade and bravado,"
660,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"But a regular, rich Don Rataplan"
661,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Santa Claus de la Muscovado
662,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Señor Grandissimo Bastinado!
663,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,His was the rental of half Havana
664,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And all Matanzas; and Santa Anna,"
665,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Rich as he was, could hardly hold"
666,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,A candle to light the mines of gold
667,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Our Cuban owned, choke-full of diggers;"
668,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And broad plantations, that, in round figures,"
669,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Were stocked with at least five thousand niggers!
670,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,“Gather ye rosebuds while ye may!”
671,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"The Señor swore to carry the day,"
672,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"To capture the beautiful Princess May,"
673,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,With his battery of treasure;
674,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Velvet and lace she should not lack;
675,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Tiffany, Haughwout, Ball & Black,"
676,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Genin and Stewart, his suit should back,"
677,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And come and go at her pleasure;
678,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Jet and lava—silver and gold—
679,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Garnets—emeralds rare to behold—
680,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Diamonds—sapphires—wealth untold—
681,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"All were hers, to have and to hold;"
682,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Enough to fill a peck-measure!
683,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
684,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,He didn’t bring all his forces on
685,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"At once, but like a crafty old Don,"
686,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Who many a heart had fought and won,"
687,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Kept bidding a little higher;
688,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And every time he made his bid,"
689,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And what she said, and all they did—"
690,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"’Twas written down,"
691,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"For the good of the town,"
692,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"By Jeems, of _The Daily Flyer_."
693,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
694,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"A coach and horses, you’d think, would buy"
695,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,For the Don an easy victory;
696,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,But slowly our Princess yielded.
697,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"A diamond necklace caught her eye,"
698,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,But a wreath of pearls first made her sigh.
699,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"She knew the worth of each maiden glance,"
700,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And, like young colts, that curvet and prance,"
701,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"She led the Don a deuce of a dance,"
702,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,In spite of the wealth he wielded.
703,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
704,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"She stood such a fire of silks and laces,"
705,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Jewels, and golden dressing-cases,"
706,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And ruby brooches, and jets and pearls,"
707,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,That every one of her dainty curls
708,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Brought the price of a hundred common girls;
709,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Folks thought the lass demented!
710,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"But at last a wonderful diamond ring,"
711,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"An infant Koh-i-noor, did the thing,"
712,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And, sighing with love, or something the same,"
713,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,(What’s in a name?)
714,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,The Princess May consented.
715,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
716,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Ring! ring the bells, and bring"
717,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,The people to see the marrying!
718,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Let the gaunt and hungry and ragged poor
719,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Throng round the great Cathedral door,"
720,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"To wonder what all the hubbub’s for,"
721,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And sometimes stupidly wonder
722,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"At so much sunshine and brightness, which"
723,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Fall from the church upon the rich,"
724,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,While the poor get all the thunder.
725,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
726,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Ring! ring, merry bells, ring!"
727,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"O fortunate few,"
728,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"With letters blue,"
729,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Good for a seat and a nearer view!
730,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Fortunate few, whom I dare not name;"
731,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,_Dilettanti! Crême de la crême!_
732,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,We commoners stood by the street façade
733,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And caught a glimpse of the cavalcade;
734,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,We saw the bride
735,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"In diamonded pride,"
736,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"With jewelled maidens to guard her side,—"
737,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
738,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Six lustrous maidens in tarletan.
739,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,She led the van of the caravan;
740,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Close behind her, her mother"
741,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"(Dressed in gorgeous _moire antique_,"
742,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"That told, as plainly as words could speak,"
743,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"She was more antique than the other,)"
744,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Leaned on the arm of Don Rataplan
745,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Santa Claus de la Muscovado
746,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Señor Grandissimo Bastinado.
747,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Happy mortal! fortunate man!
748,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And Marquis of El Dorado!
749,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
750,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"In they swept, all riches and grace,"
751,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Silks and satins, jewels and lace;"
752,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"In they swept from the dazzled sun,"
753,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And soon in the church the deed was done.
754,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Three prelates stood on the chancel high;
755,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,A knot that gold and silver can buy
756,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Gold and silver may yet untie,"
757,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Unless it is tightly fastened;
758,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"What’s worth doing at all’s worth doing well,"
759,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And the sale of a young Manhattan belle
760,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Is not to be pushed or hastened;
761,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"So two Very-Reverends graced the scene,"
762,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And the tall Archbishop stood between,"
763,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,By prayer and fasting chastened.
764,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"The Pope himself would have come from Rome,"
765,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,But Garibaldi kept him at home.
766,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Haply these robed prelates thought
767,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Their words were the power that tied the knot;
768,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"But another power that love-knot tied,"
769,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And I saw the chain round the neck of the bride,—"
770,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"A glistening, priceless, marvellous chain,"
771,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Coiled with diamonds again and again,"
772,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,As befits a diamond wedding;
773,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Yet still ’twas a chain, and I thought she knew it,"
774,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And half-way longed for the will to undo it,"
775,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,By the secret tears she was shedding.
776,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
777,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"But isn’t it odd, to think whenever"
778,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"We all go through that terrible River,—"
779,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Whose sluggish tide alone can sever
780,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"(The Archbishop says) the Church decree,"
781,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,By floating one into Eternity
782,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And leaving the other alive as ever,—"
783,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"As each wades through that ghastly stream,"
784,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,The satins that rustle and gems that gleam
785,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Will grow pale and heavy, and sink away"
786,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,To the noisome River’s bottom-clay;
787,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Then the costly bride and her maidens six
788,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Will shiver upon the banks of the Styx,"
789,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Quite as helpless as they were born,—"
790,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Naked souls, and very forlorn;"
791,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"The Princess, then, must shift for herself,"
792,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And lay her royalty on the shelf;
793,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"She, and the beautiful Empress, yonder,"
794,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Whose robes are now the wide world’s wonder,"
795,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And even ourselves, and our dear little wives,"
796,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Who calico wear each morn of their lives,"
797,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"And the sewing girls, and _les chiffoniers_,"
798,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"In rags and hunger,—a gaunt array,—"
799,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,And all the grooms of the caravan—
800,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Ay, even the great Don Rataplan"
801,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Santa Claus de la Muscovado
802,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Señor Grandissimo Bastinado—
803,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"That gold-encrusted, fortunate man!—"
804,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,All will land in naked equality:
805,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,The lord of a ribboned principality
806,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Will mourn the loss of his _cordon_.
807,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Nothing to eat, and nothing to wear"
808,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,Will certainly be the fashion there!
809,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Ten to one, and I’ll go it alone,"
810,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Those most used to a rag and bone,"
811,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Though here on earth they labor and groan,"
812,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,"Will stand it best, as they wade abreast"
813,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,To the other side of Jordan.
814,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
815,THE DIAMOND WEDDING.,
816,PENELOPE.,PENELOPE.
817,PENELOPE.,
818,PENELOPE.,"Not thus, Ulysses, with a tender word,"
819,PENELOPE.,"Pretence of state affairs, soft blandishment,"
820,PENELOPE.,"And halt assurances, canst thou evade"
821,PENELOPE.,My heart’s discernment. Think not such a film
822,PENELOPE.,"Hath touched these aged eyes, to make them lose"
823,PENELOPE.,"The subtlest mood of those even now adroop,"
824,PENELOPE.,"Self-conscious, darkling from my nearer gaze."
825,PENELOPE.,"Full well I know thy mind, O man of wiles!"
826,PENELOPE.,"O man of restless yearnings—fate-impelled,"
827,PENELOPE.,Fate-conquering—like a waif thrown back and forth
828,PENELOPE.,O’er many waters! Oft I see thee stand
829,PENELOPE.,"At eve, a landmark on the outer cliff,"
830,PENELOPE.,"Looking far westward; later, when the feast"
831,PENELOPE.,"Smokes in the hall, and nimble servants pass"
832,PENELOPE.,"Great bowls of wine, and ancient Phemeus sings"
833,PENELOPE.,"The deeds of Peleus’ son, thy right hand moves"
834,PENELOPE.,"Straight for its sword-hilt, like a ship for home;"
835,PENELOPE.,"Then, when thou hearest him follow in the song"
836,PENELOPE.,Thine own miraculous sojourn of long years
837,PENELOPE.,"Through stormy seas, weird islands, and the land"
838,PENELOPE.,"Of giants, and the gray companions smite"
839,PENELOPE.,"Their shields, and cry, _What do we longer here?_"
840,PENELOPE.,_Afloat! and let the great waves bear us on!_
841,PENELOPE.,"I know thou growest weary of the realm,"
842,PENELOPE.,"Thy wife, thy son, the people, and thy fame."
843,PENELOPE.,
844,PENELOPE.,I too have had my longings. Am I not
845,PENELOPE.,"Penelope, who, when Ulysses came"
846,PENELOPE.,"To Sparta, and Icarius bade her choose"
847,PENELOPE.,"Betwixt her sire and wooer, veiled her face"
848,PENELOPE.,"And stept upon the galley silver-oared,"
849,PENELOPE.,And since hath kept thine Ithacensian halls?
850,PENELOPE.,Then when the hateful Helen fled to Troy
851,PENELOPE.,"With Paris, and the Argive chieftains sailed"
852,PENELOPE.,"Then ships to Aulis, I would have thee go—"
853,PENELOPE.,"Presaging fame, and power, and spoils of war."
854,PENELOPE.,So ten years passed; meanwhile I reared thy son
855,PENELOPE.,"To know his father’s wisdom, and, apart"
856,PENELOPE.,"Among my maidens, wove the yellow wool."
857,PENELOPE.,"But then, returning one by one, they came,—"
858,PENELOPE.,The island-princes; high-born dames of Crete
859,PENELOPE.,And Cephalonia saw again their lords;
860,PENELOPE.,Only Ulysses came not; yet the war
861,PENELOPE.,"Was over, and his vessels, like a troop"
862,PENELOPE.,"Of cranes in file, had spread their wings for home."
863,PENELOPE.,More was unknown. Then many a winter’s night
864,PENELOPE.,"The servants piled great fagots, smeared with tar,"
865,PENELOPE.,High on the palace-roof; with mine own hands
866,PENELOPE.,"I fired the heaps, that, haply, far away"
867,PENELOPE.,"On the dark waters, might my lord take heart"
868,PENELOPE.,And know the glory of his kingly towers.
869,PENELOPE.,
870,PENELOPE.,"So winter passed; and summer came and went,"
871,PENELOPE.,And winter and another summer; then—
872,PENELOPE.,"Alas, how many weary months and days!"
873,PENELOPE.,But he I loved came not. Meanwhile thou knowest
874,PENELOPE.,"Pelasgia’s noblest chiefs, with kingly gifts"
875,PENELOPE.,"And pledge of dower, gathered in the halls;"
876,PENELOPE.,"But still this heart kept faithful, knowing yet"
877,PENELOPE.,"Thou wouldst return, though wrecked on alien shores."
878,PENELOPE.,And great Athenè often in my dreams
879,PENELOPE.,"Shone, uttering words of cheer. But, last of all,"
880,PENELOPE.,"The people rose, swearing a king should rule,"
881,PENELOPE.,To keep their ancient empery of the isles
882,PENELOPE.,Inviolate and thrifty: bade me choose
883,PENELOPE.,"A mate, nor longer dally. Then I prayed"
884,PENELOPE.,"Respite, until the web within my loom,"
885,PENELOPE.,Of gold and purple curiously devised
886,PENELOPE.,"For old Laertes’ shroud, should fall complete"
887,PENELOPE.,From hands still faithful to his blood. Thou knowest
888,PENELOPE.,"How like a ghost I left my couch at night,"
889,PENELOPE.,"Unravelling the labor of the day,"
890,PENELOPE.,"And warded off the fate, till came that time"
891,PENELOPE.,"When my lost sea-king thundered in his halls,"
892,PENELOPE.,And with long arrows clove the suitors’ hearts.
893,PENELOPE.,So constant was I! now not thirty moons
894,PENELOPE.,"Go by, and thou forgettest all. Alas!"
895,PENELOPE.,What profit is there any more in love?
896,PENELOPE.,What thankless sequel hath a woman’s faith!
897,PENELOPE.,
898,PENELOPE.,"Yet if thou wilt,—in these thy golden years,"
899,PENELOPE.,"Safe-housed in royalty, like a god revered"
900,PENELOPE.,"By all the people,—if thou yearnest yet"
901,PENELOPE.,"Once more to dare the deep and Neptune’s hate,"
902,PENELOPE.,I will not linger in a widowed age;
903,PENELOPE.,"I will not lose Ulysses, hardly found"

1093,SUMMER RAIN.,For the blessed summer showers.
1094,SUMMER RAIN.,
1095,SUMMER RAIN.,Not in vain the prayer was said;
1096,SUMMER RAIN.,"For at sunset, overhead,"

1173,SUMMER RAIN.,That again the lurid rays
1174,SUMMER RAIN.,Of that hidden sun shall shine
1175,SUMMER RAIN.,"On the floweret and the vine,"
1176,SUMMER RAIN.,And again the meadow-springs
1177,SUMMER RAIN.,Fly away on misty wings:
1178,SUMMER RAIN.,But no glare of Fate adverse
1179,SUMMER RAIN.,"Shall on us achieve its curse,"
1180,SUMMER RAIN.,Never any baneful gleam

1341,FLOOD-TIDE.,"I myself would seize their banner; they should follow where it led,"

1343,FLOOD-TIDE.,It were better than to conquer—from the light of life to go
1344,FLOOD-TIDE.,"With such words as once were uttered, off the isle of Floreo:"
1345,FLOOD-TIDE.,"_Here die I, Sir Richard Grenvile, of a free and joyful mood:_"
1346,FLOOD-TIDE.,"_Ending earth for God and honor, as a valiant soldier should!_"
1347,FLOOD-TIDE.,"But my present life—what is it? mated, housed, like other men;"
1348,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Thoughtful of the cost of feeding, valiant only with the pen;"
1349,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Lying, walled about with custom, on an iron bed of creeds;"
1350,FLOOD-TIDE.,Peering out through grated windows at the joy my spirit needs.
1351,FLOOD-TIDE.,"And I hear the sound of chanting,—mailed men are passing by;"
1352,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Crumble, walls, and loosen, fetters! I will join them, ere I die!”"
1353,FLOOD-TIDE.,
1354,FLOOD-TIDE.,"So the sleeping thoughts of boyhood oped their eyes and newly stirred,"
1355,FLOOD-TIDE.,"And my muscles cried for usage, till the man their plainings heard:"
1356,FLOOD-TIDE.,"While the star that lit me ever in the dark and thorny ways,"
1357,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Mine by natal consecration, by the choice of after days,—"
1358,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Seen through all the sorrow thickening round the hopes of younger years,—"
1359,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Rayless grew, and left me groping in the valley of my tears."
1360,FLOOD-TIDE.,
1361,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Seaward now the steamer hovered; seaward far her pennons trailed,"
1362,FLOOD-TIDE.,Where the blueness of the heavens at the clear horizon paled;
1363,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Where the mingled sky and water faded into fairy-land,"
1364,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Smaller than her tiny model, deftly launched from childhood’s hand."
1365,FLOOD-TIDE.,"With a statelier swell and longer, up the glacis of the shore,"
1366,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Came the waves that leapt so freshly in their youth, an hour before."
1367,FLOOD-TIDE.,"So I made an end and, turning, reached a scallop-crested rock,"
1368,FLOOD-TIDE.,In the stormy spring-tides hurling back the tumult of their shock.
1369,FLOOD-TIDE.,"There reclining, gazed a moment at the pebbles by my feet,"
1370,FLOOD-TIDE.,Left behind the billowy armies on their oceanward retreat;
1371,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Thousands lying close together, where the hosts a passage wore,"
1372,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Many-hued, and tesselated in a quaint mosaic floor."
1373,FLOOD-TIDE.,
1374,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Thinking then upon their fitness,—each adjusted to its place,"
1375,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Fairly strewn, and smoothed by Nature with her own exceeding grace,—"
1376,FLOOD-TIDE.,"All at once some unseen warder drew the curtains wide apart,"
1377,FLOOD-TIDE.,That awhile had cast their shadow on the picture of my heart;
1378,FLOOD-TIDE.,Told me—“Thou thyself hast said it; in thy calling be of cheer:

1385,FLOOD-TIDE.,"All the pangs of long endurance, the dear pains of fortitude;"
1386,FLOOD-TIDE.,Felt a harsh misapprehension gall the wounds of martyrdom;
1387,FLOOD-TIDE.,In the present rancor measured even the scorn of days to come;
1388,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Known that never should the whiteness of their virtue shine revealed,"
1389,FLOOD-TIDE.,Never should the truer Future rub the tarnish from the shield.
1390,FLOOD-TIDE.,That diviner abnegation hath not yet been asked of thee:
1391,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Art thou able to attain it, if perchance it were to be?"
1392,FLOOD-TIDE.,"O, our feeble tests of greatness! Look for one so calm of soul"

1394,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Noble deeds are held in honor, but the wide world sorely needs"

1396,FLOOD-TIDE.,
1397,FLOOD-TIDE.,As the darkened earth forever to the morning turns again;
1398,FLOOD-TIDE.,"As the dreaming soldier, after all the perilous campaign,"
1399,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Struggling long with horse and rider, in his sleep smites fiercely out,"
1400,FLOOD-TIDE.,"And, with sudden pang awaking, through the darkness peers about,—"
1401,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Hearing but the crickets chirrup loud, beneath his chimney-stone,"
1402,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Feeling but the warm heart throbbing, in the form beside his own,—"
1403,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Then to knowledge of his hamlet, dearer for the toil he knows,"
1404,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Comes at last, content to nestle in the sweets of his repose,"
1405,FLOOD-TIDE.,"So fell I, from those high fancies, to the quiet of a heart"
1406,FLOOD-TIDE.,Knowing well how Duty maketh each one’s share the better part.
1407,FLOOD-TIDE.,"As again I looked about me—North and South, and East and West—"
1408,FLOOD-TIDE.,Now of all the wide world over still my haven seemed the best.
1409,FLOOD-TIDE.,
1410,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Calm, and slowly lifting upward, rose the eastern glory higher,"

1414,FLOOD-TIDE.,"At the last I sought my cottage; there, before the garden gate,"

1416,FLOOD-TIDE.,"Stooping at the porch, we entered;—where the morning meal was laid,"

1632,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,You reason _ex cathedra_. Little gain
1633,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,Have we to clash in tourney on the least
1634,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Of points, wherewith you trammel down the Faith,"
1635,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"It being, at outset, understood right well"
1636,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"By lay knights-errant, that their Reverend foes,"
1637,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Fore-pledged to hold their own, will sound their trumps,"
1638,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Though spearless and unhorsed! Why take the field,"
1639,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"When, at the best, both sides go bowing off"
1640,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"With mutual courtesy, and fair white flags"
1641,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Afloat at camp, and every fight is drawn?"
1642,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"As soon encounter statues, balanced well"
1643,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Upon their granite, fashioned not to move,"
1644,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,And drawing all mankind to hold in awe
1645,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,Their grim persistence.
1646,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,
1647,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"If, indeed, I sin"
1648,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,In counting somewhat freely on that Love
1649,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"From which, through rolling ages, worlds have sprung,"
1650,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"And—last and best of all—the lords of worlds,"
1651,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,Through type on type uplifted from the clay;
1652,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,If I have been exultant in the thought
1653,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"That such humanity came so near to God,"
1654,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"He held us as His children, and would find"
1655,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,Imperial progress through the halls of Time
1656,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"For every soul,—why, then, my crescent faith"
1657,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Clings round the promise; if it spread beyond,"
1658,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"You think, too far, I say that Peter sprang"
1659,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Upon the waves of surging Galilee,"
1660,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,While all the eleven hugged the ship in fear:
1661,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,The waters were as stone unto his feet
1662,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Until he doubted, even then the Christ"
1663,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Put forth a blesséd hand, and drew him on"
1664,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,To closer knowledge!
1665,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,
1666,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"So, if it be mine"
1667,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"First of us twain to pass the sable gates,"
1668,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"That guard so well their mysteries, and thou,"
1669,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"With some dear friend, may’st stand beside my grave,"
1670,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,Speak no such words as these:—“Not long ago
1671,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,His voice rang out as cheerly as mine own;
1672,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"And we were friends, and, far into the nights,"
1673,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,Would analyze the wisdom of old days
1674,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,By all the tests of Science in her prime;
1675,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Anon would tramp afield, to fruits and flowers,"
1676,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,And the long prototypes of trees and beasts
1677,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Graven in sandstone; so, at last, would come,"
1678,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Through lanes of talk, to that perennial tree,—"
1679,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"The Tree of Life, on which redemption hangs."
1680,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"But there fell out of tune; we parted there,"
1681,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,He bolstering up a creed too broad for me!
1682,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"I held him kindly for an ardent soul,"
1683,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,Who lacked not skill to make his argument
1684,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,Seem fair and specious. But he groped in doubt:
1685,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"His head and heart were young; he wandered off,"
1686,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,And fell afoul of all those theorists
1687,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,Who soften down our dear New England faith
1688,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"With German talk of ‘Nature,’ ‘inner lights"
1689,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"And harmonies’: so, taken with the wind"
1690,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Of those high-sounding terms, he spoke at large,"
1691,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,And held discussion bravely till he died.
1692,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Here sleep his ashes; where his soul may be,"
1693,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Myself, who loved him, do not care to think.”"
1694,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,
1695,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,The ecstasy of Faith has no such fears
1696,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"As those you nurse for me! The marvellous love,"
1697,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Which folds the systems in a flood of light,"
1698,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,Makes no crude works to shatter out of joint
1699,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Through all the future. O, believe, with me,"
1700,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,For every instinct in these hearts of ours
1701,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"A full fruition hastens! O, believe"
1702,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,That promise greater than our greatest trust
1703,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"And loftiest aspiration! Tell thy friend,"
1704,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Beside my grave: “He did the best he could,"
1705,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,With earnest spirit polishing the lens
1706,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"By which he took the heavens in his ken,"
1707,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,And through the empyrean sought for God;
1708,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"He caught, or thought he caught, from time to time,"
1709,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Bright glimpses of the Infinite, on which"
1710,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"He fed in rapturous and quiet joy,"
1711,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,That helped him keep a host of troubles down.
1712,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"He went his way,—a different path from mine,"
1713,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,But took his place among the ranks of men
1714,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Who toil and suffer. If, in sooth, it be"
1715,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Religion keeps us up, this man had that."
1716,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,God grant his yearnings were a living faith!
1717,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,Heaven lies above us: may we find him there
1718,TO REV. ⸺ ⸺,"Beside the waters still, and crowned with palms!”"

1722,THE FRESHET.,
1723,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.
1724,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1725,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Last August, of a three weeks’ country tour,"
1726,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Five dreamy days were passed amid old elms
1727,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"And older mansions, and in leafy dales,"
1728,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,That knew us till our elders pushed us forth
1729,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"To larger life,—as eagles push their young,"
1730,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"New-fledged and wondering, from the eyrie’s edge,"
1731,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,To cater for themselves.
1732,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1733,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"I fell in, there,"
1734,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"With Gilbert Ripley, once my chum at Yale."
1735,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Poor Gilbert groaned along a double year,—"
1736,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Read, spoke, boxed, fenced, rowed, trod the foot-ball ground,—"
1737,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Loving the college library more than Greek,"
1738,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,His meerschaum most of all. But when we came
1739,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Together, gathered from the breathing-time"
1740,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"They give the fellows while the dog-days last,"
1741,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"He found the harness chafe; then grew morose,"
1742,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"And kicked above the traces, going home"
1743,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Hardly a Junior, but a sounder man,"
1744,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"In mind and body, than a host who win"
1745,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Your baccalaureate honors. There he stayed,"
1746,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Half tired of bookmen, on his father’s farm,"
1747,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,And gladly felt the plough-helve. In a year
1748,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"The old man gave his blessing to the son,"
1749,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"And left his life, as ’twere his harvest-field,"
1750,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"When work was over. Gilbert hugged the farm,"
1751,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Now made his own, besides a pretty sum"
1752,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"In good State Sixes; partly worked the land,"
1753,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"With separate theories for every field,"
1754,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"And partly led the student-life of old,"
1755,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Mouthing his Shakespeare’s ballads to himself
1756,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Among the meadow-mows; or, when he read"
1757,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"In the evening, found a picture of his bull,"
1758,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Just brought from Devon, sleek as silk, loom in"
1759,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Before his vision. Thus he weighed his tastes,"
1760,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Each against each, in happiest equipoise."
1761,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,The neighbor farmers seeing he had thrift
1762,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"That would not run to waste, and pardoning all"
1763,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Beyond their understanding, wished him well."
1764,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1765,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"But when I saw him stride among his stock,—"
1766,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Straight-shouldered cattle, breathing of the field,—"
1767,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Saw him how blowze and hearty; then, at eve,"
1768,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Close sitting by his mother in the porch,"
1769,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Heard him discuss the methods of the times,"
1770,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"The need our country has of stalwart men,"
1771,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Who scorn the counter and will till the land,"
1772,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Strong-handed, free of thought,—I somehow felt"
1773,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"The man was noble, and his simple life"
1774,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,More like the pattern given in the Mount
1775,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Than mine, hedged close about with city life"
1776,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"And grim, conventional manners."
1777,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1778,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"So much, then,"
1779,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,For Gilbert Ripley. Not to dwell too long
1780,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Upon his doings, let me tell the tale"
1781,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"I got from him, one hazy afternoon,"
1782,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"When he and I had wandered to the bridge,"
1783,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,New-built across our favorite of the streams
1784,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"That skirt the village,—here three miles apart,"
1785,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Twin currents, joining in a third below."
1786,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1787,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"There memory’s shallop bore us dreamily,"
1788,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Through changeful windings, to the long, long days"
1789,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Of June vacations. How we boys would thrid
1790,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"The alder thickets at the water’s edge,"
1791,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Conjecturing forward, though the Present lay"
1792,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Like Eden round us; for the Future shone—
1793,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,The sun to which each young heart turned for light!
1794,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"What wild conceits of great, oracular lives,"
1795,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Ourselves would equal! but let that go by:
1796,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Each has gone by, in turn, to humbler fates."
1797,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Sometimes we angled, and our trolling hooks"
1798,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Swung the gray pickerel from his reedy shoals.
1799,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Beyond a horseshoe bend, the current’s force"
1800,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Wore out a deeper channel, where the shore"
1801,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Fell off, precipitous, on the western side."
1802,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"There dived the bathers; there I learned to swim,—"
1803,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Flung far into the middle stream by one
1804,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Who watched my gaspings, laughing, till my limbs,"
1805,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Half of themselves, struck out, and held me up."
1806,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Far down, a timbered dam, from bank to bank,"
1807,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Shut back the waters in a shadowy lake,"
1808,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,About a mimic island. Languidly
1809,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"The chestnuts still infoliate its space,"
1810,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,And still the whispering flags are intertwined
1811,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,With whitest water-lilies near the marge.
1812,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Close by, the paper-mill, with murmurous wheel,"
1813,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Still glistens through the branches, while its score"
1814,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Of laughing maidens throng the copse at noon.
1815,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1816,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"But we, with careless arms upon the rail,"
1817,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Peered through and through the water; almost saw
1818,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Its silvery Naiads, from their wavering depths,"
1819,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Gleam with strange faces upward; almost heard
1820,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Sweet voices carol: “Ah, you all come back!"
1821,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"We charm your childhood; then you roam away,"
1822,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"To float on alien waters, like the winds;"
1823,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"But, ah, you all come back,—come dreaming back!”"
1824,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1825,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"At last I broke the silence: “See,” I said"
1826,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"To Gilbert, “see how fair our dear old stream!"
1827,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"How calm, beneath the shadow of these piers,"
1828,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"It eddies in and out, and cools itself"
1829,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,In slumberous ripples whispering repose.”
1830,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1831,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"But he made answer: “Yes, this August day"
1832,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"The wave is summer-charmed, the fields are hazed;"
1833,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"But in the callow Spring, when Easter winds"
1834,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Are on us, laden with rain, these fickle streams—"
1835,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,More gentle now than in his cradled sleep
1836,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Some Alexander—take up arms, spread wide,"
1837,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Leap high and cruel in a fierce campaign
1838,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Along their valleys. See this trellised bridge,"
1839,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"New-built, and firmer than the one from which"
1840,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,We fellows dropped the line:—_that_ went away
1841,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Two years ago, like straw before a gale,"
1842,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"In the great April flood, of which you heard,"
1843,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,When George and Lucy Dorrance lost their lives.
1844,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"I saw them perish. You remember her,—"
1845,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"She that was Lucy Hall,—a charming girl,"
1846,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"The fairest of our schoolmates, with a heart"
1847,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Light as her smile and fastened all upon
1848,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,The boy that won her; yet her glances fell
1849,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Among us, right and left, like shooting stars"
1850,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,In clear October nights when winds are still.
1851,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1852,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,“That year our Equinoctial came along
1853,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Ere the snow left us. Under mountain pines
1854,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"White drifts lay frozen like the dead, and down"
1855,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Through many a gorge the bristling hemlocks crossed
1856,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Their spears above the ice-enfettered brooks;
1857,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"But the pent river wailed, through prison walls,"
1858,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,For freedom and the time to rend its chains.
1859,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,At last it came: five days a drenching rain
1860,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Flooded the country; snow-drifts fell away;
1861,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"The brooks grew rivers, and the river here—"
1862,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"A ravenous, angry torrent—tore up banks,"
1863,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"And overflowed the meadows, league on league."
1864,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Great cakes of ice, four-square, with mounds of hay,"
1865,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Fence-rails, and scattered drift-wood, and huge beams"
1866,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"From broken dams above us, mill-wheel ties,"
1867,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Smooth lumber, and the torn-up trunks of trees,"
1868,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Swept downward, strewing all the land about."
1869,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Sometimes the flood surrounded, unawares,"
1870,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Stray cattle, or a flock of timorous sheep,"
1871,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"And bore them with it, struggling, till the ice"
1872,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Beat shape and being from them. You know how
1873,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,These freshets scour our valleys. So it raged
1874,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,A night and day; but when the day grew night
1875,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"The storm fell off; lastly, the sun went down"
1876,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Quite clear of clouds, and ere he came again"
1877,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,The flood began to lower.
1878,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1879,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,“Through the rise
1880,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"We men had been at work, like water-sprites,"
1881,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Lending a helping hand to cottagers
1882,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Along the lowlands. Now, at early morn,"
1883,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"The banks were sentry-lined with thrifty swains,"
1884,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Who hauled great stores of drift-wood up the slope.
1885,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,But toward the bridge our village maidens soon
1886,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Came flocking, thick as swallows after storms,"
1887,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"When, with light wing, they skim the happy fields"
1888,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"And greet the sunshine. Danger mostly gone,"
1889,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,They watched the thunderous passage of the flood
1890,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Between the abutments, while the upper stream,"
1891,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Far as they saw, lay like a seething strait,"
1892,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"From hill to hill. Below, with gradual fall"
1893,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Through narrower channels, all was clash and clang"
1894,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,And inarticulate tumult. Through the grove
1895,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Yonder, our picnic-ground, the driving tide"
1896,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Struck a new channel, and the craggy ice"
1897,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Scored down its saplings. Following with the rest
1898,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Came George and Lucy, not three honeymoons"
1899,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Made man and wife, and happier than a pair"
1900,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Of cooing ring-doves in the early June.
1901,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1902,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"“Two piers, you know, bore up the former bridge,"
1903,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Cleaving the current, wedge-like, on the north;"
1904,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Between them stood our couple, intergrouped"
1905,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,With many others. On a sudden loomed
1906,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"An immolating terror from above,—"
1907,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"A floating field of ice, where fifty cakes"
1908,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Had clung together, mingled with a mass"
1909,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Of _débris_ from the upper conflict, logs"
1910,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Woven in with planks and fence-rails; and in front
1911,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"One huge, old, fallen trunk rose like a wall"
1912,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Across the channel. Then arose a cry
1913,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"From all who saw it, clamoring, _Flee the bridge!_"
1914,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"_Run shoreward for your lives!_ and all made haste,"
1915,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Eastward and westward, till they felt the ground"
1916,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Stand firm beneath them; but, with close-locked arms,"
1917,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Lucy and George still looked, from the lower rail,"
1918,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Toward the promontory where we stood,"
1919,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Nor saw the death, nor seemed to hear the cry."
1920,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,_Run George! run Lucy!_ shouted all at once;
1921,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Too late, too late! for, with resistless crash,"
1922,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Against both piers that mighty ruin lay
1923,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"A space that seemed an hour, yet far too short"
1924,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"For rescue. Swaying slowly back and forth,"
1925,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"With ponderous tumult, all the bridge went off;"
1926,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Piers, beams, planks, railings snapped their groaning ties"
1927,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,And fell asunder!
1928,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1929,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"“But the middle part,"
1930,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Wrought with great bolts of iron, like a raft"
1931,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Held out awhile, whirled onward in the wreck"
1932,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"This way and that, and washed with freezing spray."
1933,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Faster than I can tell you, it came down"
1934,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Beyond our point, and in a flash we saw"
1935,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"George, on his knees, close-clinging for dear life,"
1936,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"One arm around the remnant of the rail,"
1937,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"One clasping Lucy. We were pale as they,"
1938,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Powerless to save; but even as they swept
1939,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Across the bend, and twenty stalwart men"
1940,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Ran to and fro with clamor for _A rope!_
1941,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,_A boat!_—their cries together reached the shore:
1942,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,_Save her! Save him!_—so true Love conquers all.
1943,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Furlongs below they still more closely held
1944,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Each other, ’mid a thousand shocks of ice"
1945,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"And seething horrors; till, at last, the end"
1946,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Came, where the river, scornful of its bed,"
1947,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Struck a new channel, roaring through the grove."
1948,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"There, dashed against a naked beech that stood"
1949,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Grimly in front, their shattered raft gave up"
1950,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,Its precious charge; and then a mist of tears
1951,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Blinded all eyes, through which we seemed to see"
1952,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,"Two forms in death-clasp whirled along the flood,"
1953,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,And all was over.
1954,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,
1955,A CONNECTICUT IDYL.,“Then from out the crowd

2817,I.,"1. Hendrick Van Ghelt of Monmouth shore,"
2818,I.,His fame still rings the county o’er!
2819,I.,"The stock that he raised, the stallion he rode,"
2820,I.,The fertile acres his farmers sowed;
2821,I.,The dinners he gave; the yacht which lay
2822,I.,At his fishing-dock in the Lower Bay;
2823,I.,"The suits he waged, through many a year,"
2824,I.,"For a rood of land behind his pier,—"
2825,I.,Of these the chronicles yet remain
2826,I.,From Navesink Heights to Freehold Plain.
2827,I.,
2828,I.,2. The Shrewsbury people in autumn help
2829,I.,"Their sandy toplands with marl and kelp,"
2830,I.,And their peach and apple orchards fill
2831,I.,The gurgling vats of the cross-road mill.
2832,I.,"They tell, as each twirls his tavern-can,"
2833,I.,"Wonderful tales of that stanch old man,"
2834,I.,"And they boast, of the draught they have tasted and smelt,"
2835,I.,“’Tis good as the still of Hendrick Van Ghelt!”
2836,I.,
2837,I.,"3. Were he alive, and at his prime,"
2838,I.,"In this, our boisterous modern time,"
2839,I.,"He would surely be, as he could not then,"
2840,I.,"A stalwart leader of mounted men,—"
2841,I.,"A ranger, shouting his battle-cry,"
2842,I.,Who knew how to fight and dared to die;
2843,I.,And the fame which a county’s limit spanned
2844,I.,Might have grown a legend throughout the land.
2845,I.,
2846,I.,"4. He would have scoured the Valley through,"
2847,I.,Doing as now our bravest do;
2848,I.,"Would have tried rough-riding on the border,"
2849,I.,Punishing raider and marauder;
2850,I.,With bearded Ashby crossing swords
2851,I.,As he took the Shenandoah fords;
2852,I.,Giving bold Stuart a bloody chase
2853,I.,Ere he reached again his trysting-place.
2854,I.,Horse and horseman of the foe
2855,I.,"The blast of his bugle-charge should know,"
2856,I.,"And his men should water their steeds, at will,"
2857,I.,From the banks of Southern river and rill.
2858,I.,
2859,I.,"5. How many are there of us, in this"
2860,I.,"Discordant social wilderness,"
2861,I.,"Whose thriftiest scions the power gain,"
2862,I.,"Through meet conditions of sun and rain,"
2863,I.,"To yield, on the fairest blossoming shoot,"
2864,I.,A mellow harvest of perfect fruit?
2865,I.,"Fashioned after so rare a type,"
2866,I.,"How should his life grow full and ripe,"
2867,I.,"There, in the passionless haunts of Peace,"
2868,I.,"Through trade, and tillage, and wealth’s increase?"
2869,I.,
2870,I.,"6. But at his manor-house he dwelt,"
2871,I.,And royally bore the name Van Ghelt;
2872,I.,Nor found a larger part to play
2873,I.,Than such as a county magnate may:
2874,I.,"Ruling the hustings as he would,"
2875,I.,Lord of the rustic neighborhood;
2876,I.,With potent wishes and quiet words
2877,I.,Holding an undisputed sway.
2878,I.,"The broadest meadows, the fattest herds,"
2879,I.,"The fleetest roadsters, the warmest cheer,—"
2880,I.,These were old Hendrick’s many a year.
2881,I.,"Daughters unto his hearthstone came,"
2882,I.,And a son—to keep the ancient name.
2883,I.,
2884,I.,"7. Often, perchance, the old man’s eye"
2885,I.,"From a seaward casement would espy,"
2886,I.,"Scanning the harborage in the bay,"
2887,I.,A ship which idly at anchor lay;
2888,I.,"Watching her as she rose and fell,"
2889,I.,"Up and down, with the evening swell,"
2890,I.,"Her cordage slackened, her sails unbent,"
2891,I.,And all her proud life somnolent.
2892,I.,"And perchance he thought—“My life, it seems,"
2893,I.,"Like her, unfreighted with aught but dreams;"
2894,I.,Yet I feel within me a strength to dare
2895,I.,"Some outward voyage, I know not where!”"
2896,I.,But the forceful impulse wore away
2897,I.,"In the common life of every day,"
2898,I.,And for Hendrick Van Ghelt no timely hour
2899,I.,Ruffled the calm of that hidden power;
2900,I.,Yet in the prelude of my song
2901,I.,"His storied presence may well belong,"
2902,I.,"As a Lombardy poplar, lithe and hoar,"
2903,I.,"Stands at a Monmouth farmer’s door,"
2904,I.,"Set like a spire against the sky,"
2905,I.,"Marking the hours, while lover and maid"
2906,I.,"Linger long in its stately shade,"
2907,I.,And round its summit the swallows fly.
2908,I.,
2909,I.,
2910,II.,II.
2911,II.,
2912,II.,"1. Nature a devious by-way finds: solve me her secret whim,"
2913,II.,That the seed of a gnarled oak should sprout to a sapling straight and
2914,II.,prim;
2915,II.,"That a russet should grow on the pippin stock, on the garden-rose a"
2916,II.,brier;
2917,II.,"That a stalwart race, in old Hendrick’s son, should smother its wonted"
2918,II.,fire.
2919,II.,
2920,II.,"Hermann, fond of his book, and shirking the brawny out-door sports;"
2921,II.,"Sent to college, and choosing for life the law with her mouldy courts;"
2922,II.,"Proud, and of tender honor, as well became his father’s blood,"
2923,II.,But with cold and courtly self-restraint weighing the ill and good;
2924,II.,
2925,II.,"Wed to a lady whose delicate veins that molten azure held,"
2926,II.,"Ichor of equal birth, wherewith our gentry their couplings weld;"
2927,II.,"Viewing his father’s careless modes with half a tolerant eye,"
2928,II.,"As one who honors, regretting not, old fashions passing by."
2929,II.,
2930,II.,"After a while the moment came when, unto the son and heir,"
2931,II.,"A son and heir was given in turn,—a moment of joy and prayer;"
2932,II.,"For the angel who guards the portals twain oped, in the self-same breath,"
2933,II.,"To the child the pearly gate of life, to the mother the gate of death."
2934,II.,
2935,II.,"Father, and son, and an infant plucking the daisies over a grave:"
2936,II.,"The swell of a boundless surge keeps on, wave following after wave;"
2937,II.,Ever the tide of life sets toward the low invisible shore:
2938,II.,Whence had the current its distant source? when shall it flow no more?
2939,II.,
2940,II.,"2. Nature’s serene renewals, that make the scion by one remove"
2941,II.,Bear the ancestral blossom and thrive as the forest wilding throve!
2942,II.,"Roseate stream of life, which hides the course its ducts pursue,"
2943,II.,"To rise, like that Sicilian fount, in far-off springs anew!"
2944,II.,
2945,II.,"For the grandsire’s vigor, rude and rare, asleep in the son had lain,"
2946,II.,"To waken in Hugh, the grandson’s frame, with the ancient force again;"
2947,II.,"And ere the boy, said the Monmouth wives, had grown to his seventh year,"
2948,II.,Well could you tell whose mantling blood swelled in his temples clear.
2949,II.,
2950,II.,"Tall, and bent in the meeting brows; swarthy of hair and face;"
2951,II.,"Shoulders parting square, but set with the future huntsman’s grace;"
2952,II.,Eyes alive with a fire which yet the old man’s visage wore
2953,II.,"At times, like the flash of a thunder-cloud when the storm is almost"
2954,II.,o’er.
2955,II.,
2956,II.,"3. Toward the mettled stripling, then, the heart of the old man yearned;"
2957,II.,"And thus—while Hermann Van Ghelt once more, with a restless hunger,"
2958,II.,turned
2959,II.,"From the grave of her who died so young, to his books and lawyer’s gown,"
2960,II.,And the ceaseless clangor of mind with mind in the close and wrangling
2961,II.,town—
2962,II.,
2963,II.,"They two, the boy and the grandsire, lived at the manor-house, and grew,"
2964,II.,"The one to all manly arts apace, the other a youth anew—"
2965,II.,"Pleased with the boy’s free spirit, and teaching him, step by step, to"
2966,II.,wield
2967,II.,"The mastery over living things, and the craft of flood and field."
2968,II.,
2969,II.,"Apt, indeed, was the scholar; and born with a subtle art to gain"
2970,II.,"The love of all dumb creatures at will; now lifting himself, by the mane,"
2971,II.,"Over the neck of the three-year colt, for a random bareback ride,"
2972,II.,Now chasing the waves on the rifted beach at the turn of the evening
2973,II.,tide.
2974,II.,
2975,II.,"Proud, in sooth, was the master: the youngster, he oft and roundly swore,"
2976,II.,Was fit for the life a gentleman led in the lusty days of yore!
2977,II.,"And he took the boy wherever he drove,—to a county fair or race;"
2978,II.,Gave him the reins and watched him guide the span at a spanking pace;
2979,II.,
2980,II.,"Taught him the sportsman’s keen delight: to swallow the air of morn,"
2981,II.,And start the whistling quail that hides and feeds in the dewy corn;
2982,II.,"Or in clear November underwoods to bag the squirrels, and flush"
2983,II.,"The brown-winged, mottled partridge a-whir from her nest in the tangled"
2984,II.,brush;
2985,II.,
2986,II.,"Taught him the golden harvest laws, and the signs of sun and shower,"
2987,II.,And the thousand beautiful secret ways of graft and fruit and flower;
2988,II.,"Set him straight in his saddle, and cheered him galloping over the sand;"
2989,II.,Sailed with him to the fishing-shoals and placed the helm in his hand.
2990,II.,
2991,II.,"Often the yacht, with all sail spread, was steered by the fearless twain"
2992,II.,"Around the beacon of Sandy Hook, and out in the open main;"
2993,II.,"Till the great sea-surges rolling in, as south-by-east they wore,"
2994,II.,"Lifted the bows of the dancing craft, and the buoyant hearts she bore."
2995,II.,
2996,II.,"But in dreamy hours, which young men know, Hugh loved with the tide to"
2997,II.,float
2998,II.,"Far up the deep, dark-channeled creeks, alone in his two-oared boat;"
2999,II.,"While a fiery woven tapestry o’erhung the waters low,"
3000,II.,"The warp of the frosted chestnut, the woof with maple and birch aglow;"
3001,II.,
3002,II.,"Picking the grapes which dangled down; or watching the autumn skies,"
3003,II.,"The osprey’s slow imperial swoop, the scrawny heron’s rise;"
3004,II.,"Nursing a longing for larger life than circled a rural home,"
3005,II.,"An instinct of leadership within, and of action yet to come."
3006,II.,
3007,II.,"4. Curtain of shifting seasons dropt on moor and meadow and hall,"
3008,II.,Open your random vistas of changes that come with time to all!
3009,II.,"Hugh grown up to manhood; foremost, searching the county through,"
3010,II.,"Of the Monmouth youth, in birth and grace, and the strength to will"
3011,II.,and do.
3012,II.,
3013,II.,"The father, past the prime of life, and his temples flecked with toil,"
3014,II.,"A bookman still, and leaving to Hugh the care of stock and soil."
3015,II.,"Hendrick Van Ghelt, a bowed old man in a fireside-corner chair,"
3016,II.,"Counting the porcelain Scripture tiles which frame the chimney there,—"
3017,II.,
3018,II.,"The shade of the stalwart gentleman the people used to know,"
3019,II.,"Forgetful of half the present scenes, but mindful of long-ago;"
3020,II.,"Aroused, mayhap, by growing murmurs of Southern feud, that came"

3022,II.,
3023,II.,"5. Gazing on such a group as this, folds of the curtain drop,"
3024,II.,Hiding the grandsire’s form; and the wheels of the sliding picture stop.
3025,II.,"Gone, that stout old Hendrick, at last! and from miles around they came,—"
3026,II.,"Farmer, and squire, and whispering youths, recalling his manhood’s fame."
3027,II.,
3028,II.,"Dead: and the Van Ghelt manor closed, and the homestead acres leased;"
3029,II.,"For their owner had moved more near the town, where his daily tasks"
3030,II.,"increased,"
3031,II.,"Choosing a home on the blue Passaic, whence the Newark spires and lights"
3032,II.,"Were seen, and over the salt sea-marsh the shadows of Bergen Heights."
3033,II.,
3034,II.,"Back and forth from his city work, the lawyer, day by day,"
3035,II.,"With the press of eager and toiling men, followed his wonted way;"
3036,II.,"And Hugh,—he dallied with life at home, tending the garden and grounds;"
3037,II.,But the mansion longed for a woman’s voice to soften its lonely sounds.
3038,II.,
3039,II.,"“Hugh,” said Hermann Van Ghelt, at length, “choose for yourself a wife,"
3040,II.,"Comely, and good, and of birth to match the mother who gave you life."
3041,II.,No words of woman have charmed my ear since last I heard her voice;
3042,II.,And of fairest and proudest maids her son should make a worthy choice.”
3043,II.,
3044,II.,"But now the young man’s wandering heart from the great world turned away,"
3045,II.,"To long for the healthful Monmouth meads, the shores of the breezy bay;"
3046,II.,"And often the scenes and mates he knew in boyhood he sought again,"
3047,II.,"And roamed through the well-known woods, and lay in the grass where he"
3048,II.,once had lain.
3049,II.,
3050,II.,
3051,III.,III.
3052,III.,
3053,III.,"Ladies, in silks and laces,"
3054,III.,"Lunching with lips agleam,"
3055,III.,Know you aught of the places
3056,III.,Yielding such fruit and cream?
3057,III.,
3058,III.,South from your harbor-islands
3059,III.,Glisten the Monmouth hills;
3060,III.,"There are the ocean highlands,"
3061,III.,"Lowland meadows and rills,"
3062,III.,
3063,III.,"Berries in field and garden,"
3064,III.,"Trees with their fruitage low,"
3065,III.,Maidens (asking your pardon)
3066,III.,Handsome as cities show.
3067,III.,
3068,III.,"Know you that, night and morning,"
3069,III.,"A beautiful water-fay,"
3070,III.,"Covered with strange adorning,"
3071,III.,Crosses your rippling bay?
3072,III.,
3073,III.,Her sides are white and sparkling;
3074,III.,She whistles to the shore;
3075,III.,"Behind, her hair is darkling,"
3076,III.,And the waters part before.
3077,III.,
3078,III.,Lightly the waves she measures
3079,III.,Up to the wharves of the town;
3080,III.,"There, unlading her treasures,"
3081,III.,Lovingly puts them down.
3082,III.,
3083,III.,"Come with me, ladies; cluster"
3084,III.,Here on the western pier;
3085,III.,"Look at her jewels’ lustre,"
3086,III.,Changed with the changing year!
3087,III.,
3088,III.,"First of the months to woo her,"
3089,III.,June his strawberries flings
3090,III.,"Over her garniture,"
3091,III.,Bringing her exquisite things;
3092,III.,
3093,III.,Rifling his richest casket;
3094,III.,"Handing her, everywhere,"
3095,III.,Garnets in crate and basket;
3096,III.,Knowing she soon will wear
3097,III.,
3098,III.,"Blackberry jet and lava,"
3099,III.,"Raspberries ruby-red,"
3100,III.,"Trinkets that August gave her,"
3101,III.,Over her toilet spread.
3102,III.,
3103,III.,"After such gifts have faded,"
3104,III.,"Then the peaches are seen,—"
3105,III.,"Coral and ivory braided,"
3106,III.,Fit for an Indian queen.
3107,III.,
3108,III.,"And September will send her,"
3109,III.,"Proud of his wealth, and bold,"
3110,III.,"Melons glowing in splendor,"
3111,III.,Emeralds set with gold.
3112,III.,
3113,III.,"So she glides to the Narrows,"
3114,III.,Where the forts are astir:
3115,III.,Her speed is a shining arrow’s!
3116,III.,Guns are silent for her.
3117,III.,
3118,III.,So she glides to the ringing
3119,III.,"Bells of the belfried town,"
3120,III.,"Kissing the wharves, and flinging"
3121,III.,All of her jewels down.
3122,III.,
3123,III.,"Whence she gathers her riches,"
3124,III.,"Ladies, now would you see?"
3125,III.,"Leaving your city niches,"
3126,III.,Wander awhile with me.
3127,III.,
3128,III.,
3129,IV.,IV.
3130,IV.,
3131,IV.,"1. The strawberry-vines lie in the sun,"
3132,IV.,Their myriad tendrils twined in one;
3133,IV.,"Spread like a carpet of richest dyes,"
3134,IV.,The strawberry-field in sunshine lies.
3135,IV.,"Each timorous berry, blushing red,"
3136,IV.,"Has folded the leaves above her head,"
3137,IV.,"The dark, green curtains gemmed with dew;"
3138,IV.,"But each blushful berry, peering through,"
3139,IV.,"Shows like a flock of the underthread,—"
3140,IV.,The crimson woof of a downy cloth
3141,IV.,Where the elves may kneel and plight their troth.
3142,IV.,
3143,IV.,"2. Run through the rustling vines, to show"
3144,IV.,"Each picker an even space to go,"
3145,IV.,Leaders of twinkling cord divide
3146,IV.,The field in lanes from side to side;
3147,IV.,"And here and there with patient care,"
3148,IV.,"Lifting the leafage everywhere,"
3149,IV.,Rural maidens and mothers dot
3150,IV.,The velvet of the strawberry-plot:
3151,IV.,"Fair and freckled, old and young,"
3152,IV.,"With baskets at their girdles hung,"
3153,IV.,"Searching the plants with no rude haste,"
3154,IV.,"Lest berries should hang unpicked, and waste:—"
3155,IV.,"Of the pulpy, odorous, hidden quest,"
3156,IV.,"First gift of the fruity months, and best."
3157,IV.,
3158,IV.,3. Crates of the laden baskets cool
3159,IV.,"Under the trees at the meadow’s edge,"
3160,IV.,"Covered with grass and dripping sedge,"
3161,IV.,And lily-leaves from the shaded pool;
3162,IV.,"Filled, and ready to be borne"
3163,IV.,To market before the morrow morn.
3164,IV.,"Beside them, gazing at the skies,"
3165,IV.,Hour after hour a young man lies.
3166,IV.,"From the hillside, under the trees,"
3167,IV.,"He looks across the field, and sees"
3168,IV.,"The waves that ever beyond it climb,"
3169,IV.,Whitening the rye-slope’s early prime;
3170,IV.,"At times he listens, listlessly,"
3171,IV.,"To the tree-toad singing in the tree,"
3172,IV.,Or sees the catbird peck his fill
3173,IV.,With feathers adroop and roguish bill.
3174,IV.,"But often, with a pleased unrest,"
3175,IV.,"He lifts his glances to the west,"
3176,IV.,"Watching the kirtles, red and blue,"
3177,IV.,Which cross the meadow in his view;
3178,IV.,"And he hears, anon, the busy throng"
3179,IV.,Sing the Strawberry-Pickers’ Song:
3180,IV.,
3181,IV.,"4. “Rifle the sweets our meadows bear,"
3182,IV.,Ere the day has reached its nooning;
3183,IV.,"While the skies are fair, and the morning air"
3184,IV.,Awakens the thrush’s tuning.
3185,IV.,
3186,IV.,“_Softly the rivulet’s ripples flow;_
3187,IV.,_Dark is the grove that lovers know;_
3188,IV.,"_Here, where the whitest blossoms blow,_"
3189,IV.,_The reddest and ripest berries grow._
3190,IV.,
3191,IV.,"“Bend to the crimson fruit, whose stain"
3192,IV.,Is glowing on lips and fingers;
3193,IV.,"The sun has lain in the leafy plain,"
3194,IV.,And the dust of his pinions lingers.
3195,IV.,
3196,IV.,“_Softly the rivulet’s ripples flow;_
3197,IV.,_Dark is the grove that lovers know;_
3198,IV.,"_Here, where the whitest blossoms blow,_"
3199,IV.,_The reddest and ripest berries grow._
3200,IV.,
3201,IV.,"“Gather the cones which lie concealed,"
3202,IV.,With their vines your foreheads wreathing;
3203,IV.,The strawberry-field its sweets shall yield
3204,IV.,While the western winds are breathing.
3205,IV.,
3206,IV.,“_Softly the rivulet’s ripples flow;_
3207,IV.,_Dark is the grove that lovers know;_
3208,IV.,"_Here, where the whitest blossoms blow,_"
3209,IV.,_The reddest and ripest berries grow._”
3210,IV.,
3211,IV.,5. From the far hillside comes again
3212,IV.,An echo of the pickers’ strain.
3213,IV.,Sweetly the group their cadence keep;
3214,IV.,Swiftly their hands the trailers sweep;
3215,IV.,"The vines are stripped and the song is sung,"
3216,IV.,A joyous labor for old and young;
3217,IV.,"For the blithe children, gleaning behind"
3218,IV.,"The women, marvellous treasures find."
3219,IV.,
3220,IV.,6. From the workers a maiden parts:
3221,IV.,The baskets at her waistband shine
3222,IV.,With berries that look like bleeding hearts
3223,IV.,Of a hundred lovers at her shrine;
3224,IV.,No Eastern girl were girdled so well
3225,IV.,With silken belt and silver bell.
3226,IV.,Her slender form is tall and strong;
3227,IV.,Her voice is the sweetest in the song;
3228,IV.,"Her brown hair, fit to wear a crown,"
3229,IV.,Loose from its bonnet ripples down.
3230,IV.,"Toward the crates, that lie in the shade"
3231,IV.,"Of the chestnut copse at the edge of the glade,"
3232,IV.,"She moves from her mates, through happy rows"
3233,IV.,Of the children loving her as she goes.
3234,IV.,"_Alice, our Alice!_ one and all,"
3235,IV.,"Striving to stay her footsteps, call"
3236,IV.,(For children with skilful choice dispense
3237,IV.,The largesse of their innocence);
3238,IV.,"But on, with a sister’s smile, she moves"
3239,IV.,"Into the darkness of the groves,"
3240,IV.,"And deftly, daintily, one by one,"
3241,IV.,"Shelters her baskets from the sun,"
3242,IV.,"Under the network, fresh and cool,"
3243,IV.,Of lily-leaves from the crystal pool.
3244,IV.,
3245,IV.,"7. Turning her violet eyes, their rays"
3246,IV.,Glistened full in the young man’s gaze;
3247,IV.,"And each at each, for a moment’s space,"
3248,IV.,Looked with a diffident surprise.
3249,IV.,"“Heaven!” thought Hugh, “what artless grace"
3250,IV.,That laborer’s daughter glorifies!
3251,IV.,"I never saw a fairer face,"
3252,IV.,I never heard a sweeter voice;
3253,IV.,"And oh! were she my father’s choice,"
3254,IV.,My father’s choice and mine were one
3255,IV.,In the strawberry-field and morning sun.”
3256,IV.,
3257,IV.,
3258,V.,V.
3259,V.,
3260,V.,"Love, from that summer morn"
3261,V.,Melting the souls of these two;
3262,V.,"Love, which some of you know"
3263,V.,Who read this poem to-day—
3264,V.,"Is it the same desire,"
3265,V.,"The strong, ineffable joy,"
3266,V.,"Which Jacob and Rachel felt,"
3267,V.,"When he served her father long years,"
3268,V.,And the years were swift as days—
3269,V.,So great was the love he bore?
3270,V.,"Race, advancing with time,"
3271,V.,"Growing in thought and deed,"
3272,V.,"Mastering land and sea,"
3273,V.,"Say, does the heart advance,"
3274,V.,Are its passions more pure and strong?
3275,V.,"They, like Nature, remain,"
3276,V.,No more and no less than of yore.
3277,V.,"Whoso conquers the earth,"
3278,V.,"Winning its riches and fame,"
3279,V.,"Comes to the evening at last,"
3280,V.,"The sunset of threescore years,"
3281,V.,"Confessing that Love was real,"
3282,V.,All the rest was a dream!
3283,V.,The sum of his gains is dross;
3284,V.,The song in his praise is mute;
3285,V.,The wreath of his laurels fades:
3286,V.,But the kiss of his early love
3287,V.,"Still burns on his trembling lip,"
3288,V.,The spirit of one he loved
3289,V.,Hallows his dreams at night.
3290,V.,"A little while, and the scenes"
3291,V.,Of the play of Life are closed;
3292,V.,"Come, let us rest an hour,"
3293,V.,"And by the pleasant streams,"
3294,V.,"Under the fresh, green trees,"
3295,V.,"Let us walk hand in hand,"
3296,V.,And think of the days that were.
3297,V.,
3298,V.,
3299,VI.,VI.
3300,VI.,
3301,VI.,"1. On river and height and salty moors the haze of autumn fell,"
3302,VI.,"And the cloud of a troubled joy enwrapt the face of Hugh as well,—"
3303,VI.,The spell of a secret haunt that far from home his footsteps drew;
3304,VI.,A love which over the brow of youth the mask of manhood threw.
3305,VI.,
3306,VI.,"Birds of the air to the father, at length, the common rumor brought:"
3307,VI.,"“Your son,” they sang, “in the cunning toils of a rustic lass is caught!”"
3308,VI.,"“A fit betrothal,” the lawyer said, “must make these follies cease;"
3309,VI.,"Which shall it be?—the banker’s ward?—Edith, the judge’s niece?”"
3310,VI.,
3311,VI.,"“Father, I pray”—said Hugh. “O yes!” out-leapt the other’s mood,"
3312,VI.,“I hear of your wanton loiterings; they ill become your blood!
3313,VI.,"If you hold our name at such light worth, forbear to darken the life"
3314,VI.,"Of this Alice Dale”—“No, Alice Van Ghelt! father, she is my wife.”"
3315,VI.,
3316,VI.,"2. Worldlings, who say the eagle should mate with eagle, after his kind,"
3317,VI.,Nor have learned from what far and diverse cliffs the twain each other
3318,VI.,"find,"
3319,VI.,"Yours is the old, old story, of age forgetting its wiser youth;"
3320,VI.,Of eyes which are keen for others’ good and blind to an inward truth.
3321,VI.,
3322,VI.,But the pride which closed the father’s doors swelled in the young man’s
3323,VI.,"veins,"
3324,VI.,"And he led his bride, in the sight of all, through the pleasant Monmouth"
3325,VI.,"lanes,"
3326,VI.,"To the little farm his grandsire gave, years since, for a birthday gift:"
3327,VI.,Unto such havens unforeseen the barks of our fortune drift!
3328,VI.,
3329,VI.,"There, for a happy pastoral year, he tilled the teeming field,"
3330,VI.,"Scattered the marl above his land, and gathered the orchard’s yield;"
3331,VI.,"And Alice, in fair and simple guise, kissed him at even-fall;"
3332,VI.,"And her face was to him an angel’s face, and love was all in all."
3333,VI.,
3334,VI.,"—What is this light in the southern sky, painting a red alarm?"
3335,VI.,"What is this trumpet call, which sounds through peaceful village and"
3336,VI.,"farm,—"
3337,VI.,"Jarring the sweet idyllic rest, stilling the children’s throng,"
3338,VI.,"Hushing the cricket on the hearth, and the lovers’ evening song?"
3339,VI.,
3340,VI.,
3341,VII.,VII.
3342,VII.,
3343,VII.,1.       War! war! war!
3344,VII.,Manning of forts on land and ships for sea;
3345,VII.,Innumerous lips that speak the righteous wrath
3346,VII.,Of days which have been and again may be;
3347,VII.,Flashing of tender eyes disdaining tears;
3348,VII.,"A pause of men with indrawn breath,"
3349,VII.,Knowing it awful for the people’s will
3350,VII.,"Thus, thus to end the mellow years"
3351,VII.,"Of harvest, growth, prosperity,"
3352,VII.,"And bring the years of famine, fire, and death,"
3353,VII.,Though fear and a nation’s shame are more awful still.
3354,VII.,
3355,VII.,2.       War! war! war!
3356,VII.,"A thundercloud in the South in the early Spring,—"
3357,VII.,"The launch of a thunderbolt; and then,"
3358,VII.,"With one red flare, the lightning stretched its wing,"
3359,VII.,And a rolling echo roused a million men!
3360,VII.,Then the ploughman left his field;
3361,VII.,"The smith, at his clanging forge,"
3362,VII.,Forged him a sword to wield.
3363,VII.,"From meadow, and mountain-gorge,"
3364,VII.,"And the Western plains, they came,"
3365,VII.,Fronting the storm and flame.
3366,VII.,War! war! war!
3367,VII.,Heaven aid the right!
3368,VII.,God nerve the hero’s arm in the fearful fight!
3369,VII.,"God send the women sleep, in the long, long night,"
3370,VII.,When the breasts on whose strength they leaned shall heave no more!
3371,VII.,

3373,VIII.,VIII.
3374,VIII.,
3375,VIII.,"1. Spake each mother to her son,"
3376,VIII.,Ere an ancient field was won:
3377,VIII.,"“Spartan, who me your mother call,"
3378,VIII.,Our country is mother of us all;
3379,VIII.,"In her you breathe, and move, and are."
3380,VIII.,"In peace, for her to live—in war,"
3381,VIII.,"For her to die—is, gloriously,"
3382,VIII.,A patriot to live and die!”
3383,VIII.,
3384,VIII.,2. The times are now as grand as then
3385,VIII.,"With dauntless women, earnest men;"
3386,VIII.,For thus the mothers whom we know
3387,VIII.,Bade their sons to battle go;
3388,VIII.,"And, with a smile, the loyal North"
3389,VIII.,Sent her million freemen forth.
3390,VIII.,
3391,VIII.,3. “What men should stronger-hearted be
3392,VIII.,"Than we, who dwell by the open sea,"
3393,VIII.,Tilling the lands our fathers won
3394,VIII.,In battle on the Monmouth Plains?
3395,VIII.,"Ah! a memory remains,"
3396,VIII.,"Telling us what they have done,"
3397,VIII.,Teaching us what we should do.
3398,VIII.,"Let us send our rightful share,—"
3399,VIII.,"Hard-handed yeomen, horsemen rare,"
3400,VIII.,A hundred riders fleet and true.”
3401,VIII.,
3402,VIII.,"4. A hundred horsemen, led by Hugh:"
3403,VIII.,"“Were he still here,” their captain thought,"
3404,VIII.,"“The brave old man who trained my youth,"
3405,VIII.,What a leader he would make
3406,VIII.,Where the battle’s topmost billows break!
3407,VIII.,"The crimes which brought our land to ruth,"
3408,VIII.,How in his soul they would have wrought!
3409,VIII.,"God help me, no deed of mine shall shame"
3410,VIII.,The honor of my grandsire’s name;
3411,VIII.,And my father shall see how pure and good
3412,VIII.,Runs in these veins the olden blood.”
3413,VIII.,
3414,VIII.,5. Shore and inland their men have sent:
3415,VIII.,"Away, to the mounted regiment,"
3416,VIII.,"The silver-hazed Potomac heights,"
3417,VIII.,"The circling raids, the hundred fights,"
3418,VIII.,"The booth, the bivouac, the tent."
3419,VIII.,"Away, from the happy Monmouth farms,"
3420,VIII.,"To noontide marches, night alarms,"
3421,VIII.,"Death in the shadowy oaken glades,"
3422,VIII.,"Emptied saddles, broken blades,—"
3423,VIII.,All the turmoil that soldiers know
3424,VIII.,"Who gallop to meet a mortal foe,"
3425,VIII.,"Some to conquer, some to fall:"
3426,VIII.,War hath its chances for one and all.
3427,VIII.,
3428,VIII.,"6. Heroes, who render up their lives"
3429,VIII.,On the country’s fiery altar-stone—
3430,VIII.,They do not offer themselves alone.
3431,VIII.,What shall become of the soldiers’ wives?
3432,VIII.,"They stay behind in the lonely cots,"
3433,VIII.,Weeding the humble garden-plots;
3434,VIII.,"Some to speed the needle and thread,"
3435,VIII.,For the soldiers’ children must be fed;
3436,VIII.,"All to sigh, through the toilsome day,"
3437,VIII.,And at night teach lisping lips to pray
3438,VIII.,For the fathers marching far away.
3439,VIII.,
3440,VIII.,
3441,IX.,IX.
3442,IX.,
3443,IX.,"1. Cloud and flame on the dark frontier,"
3444,IX.,Veiling the hosts embattled there:
3445,IX.,"Peace, and a boding stillness, here,"
3446,IX.,Where the wives at home repeat their prayer.
3447,IX.,
3448,IX.,2. The weary August days are long;
3449,IX.,"The locusts sing a plaintive song,"
3450,IX.,The cattle miss their master’s call
3451,IX.,When they see the sunset shadows fall.
3452,IX.,"The youthful mistress, at even-tide,"
3453,IX.,"Stands by the cedarn wicket’s side,"
3454,IX.,With both hands pushing from the front
3455,IX.,"Her hair, as those who listen are wont;"

3462,IX.,"To wait behind, and fear, and pray!"
3463,IX.,"O, if a soldier’s wife could say,—"

3465,IX.,Kiss thee ere thou meet’st the foe;
3466,IX.,"Where thou lodgest, worst or best,"
3467,IX.,Share and soothe thy broken rest!’
3468,IX.,"—Alas, to stifle her pain, and wait,"
3469,IX.,This was ever a woman’s fate!
3470,IX.,But the lonely hours at least may be
3471,IX.,"Passed a little nearer thee,"
3472,IX.,And the city thou guardest with thy life
3473,IX.,Thou’lt guard more fondly for holding thy wife.”
3474,IX.,
3475,IX.,"4. Ah, tender heart of woman leal,"
3476,IX.,Supple as wax and strong as steel!
3477,IX.,"Thousands as faithful and as lone,"
3478,IX.,"Following each some dearest one,"
3479,IX.,Found in those early months a home
3480,IX.,Under the brightness of that dome
3481,IX.,Whose argent arches for aye enfold
3482,IX.,"The hopes of a people in their hold,—"
3483,IX.,"Irradiate, in the sight of all"
3484,IX.,Who guard the Capital’s outer wall.
3485,IX.,"Lastly came one, amid the rest,"
3486,IX.,"Whose form a sunburnt soldier prest,"
3487,IX.,As lovers embrace in respite lent
3488,IX.,From unfulfilled imprisonment.
3489,IX.,And Alice found a new content:
3490,IX.,Dearer for perils that had been
3491,IX.,"Were short-lived meetings, far between;"
3492,IX.,"Better, for dangers yet to be,"
3493,IX.,The moments she still his face could see.
3494,IX.,"These, for the pure and loving wife,"
3495,IX.,"Were the silver bars that marked her life,"
3496,IX.,That numbered the days melodiously;
3497,IX.,"While, through all noble daring, Hugh"
3498,IX.,"From a Captain to a Colonel grew,"
3499,IX.,And his praises sweetened every tongue
3500,IX.,"That reached her ear,—for old and young"
3501,IX.,Gave him the gallant leader’s due.

3508,X.,"A baleful year, that hurtled by"
3509,X.,While ancient kingdoms held their breath.
3510,X.,
3511,X.,2. The Capital grew aghast with sights
3512,X.,"Flashed from the lurid river-heights,"
3513,X.,"Full of the fearful things sent down,"
3514,X.,"By demons haunting the middle air,"
3515,X.,"Into the hot, beleaguered town,—"
3516,X.,"All woful sights and sounds, which seem"
3517,X.,The fantasy of a sickly dream:
3518,X.,Crowded wickedness everywhere;
3519,X.,Everywhere a stifled sense
3520,X.,Of the noonday-striding pestilence;
3521,X.,"Every church, from wall to wall,"
3522,X.,A closely-mattressed hospital;
3523,X.,"And ah! our bleeding heroes, brought"
3524,X.,"From smouldering fields so vainly fought,"
3525,X.,Filling each place where a man could lie
3526,X.,To gasp a dying wish—and die;
3527,X.,"While the sombre sky, relentlessly,"
3528,X.,"Covered the town with a funeral-pall,"
3529,X.,"A death-damp, trickling funeral-pall."
3530,X.,
3531,X.,3. Always the dust and mire; the sound
3532,X.,"Of the rumbling wagon’s ceaseless round,"
3533,X.,The cannon jarring the trampled ground.
3534,X.,"The sad, unvarying picture wrought"
3535,X.,Upon the pitying woman’s heart
3536,X.,"Of Alice, the Colonel’s wife, and taught"
3537,X.,"Her spirit to choose the better part,—"
3538,X.,"The labor of loving angels, sent"
3539,X.,To men in their sore encompassment.
3540,X.,Daily her gentle steps were bent
3541,X.,Through the thin pathways which divide
3542,X.,"The patient sufferers, side from side,"
3543,X.,"In dolorous wards, where Death and Life"
3544,X.,"Wage their silent, endless strife;"
3545,X.,"And she gave to all her soothing words,"
3546,X.,Sweet as the songs of homestead birds.
3547,X.,Sometimes that utterance musical
3548,X.,On the soldier’s failing sense would fall
3549,X.,"Seeming, almost, a prelude given"
3550,X.,Of whispers that calm the air of Heaven;
3551,X.,"While her white hand, moistening his poor lips"
3552,X.,"With the draught which slakeless fever sips,"
3553,X.,"Pointed him to that fount above,—"
3554,X.,"River of water of life and love,—"
3555,X.,"Stream without price, of whose purity"
3556,X.,Whoever thirsteth may freely buy.

3559,X.,"She tended—’twas given her to gain,"
3560,X.,"Through Him who died upon the rood,"
3561,X.,"For that divine beatitude,"
3562,X.,Who of us all can ever know
3563,X.,Till the golden books their records show?
3564,X.,"But she saw their dying faces light,"
3565,X.,And felt a rapture in the sight.
3566,X.,And many a sufferer’s earthly life
3567,X.,Thanked for new strength the Colonel’s wife;
3568,X.,"Many a soldier turned his head,"
3569,X.,"Watching her pass his narrow bed,"
3570,X.,"Or, haply, his feeble frame would raise,"
3571,X.,As the dim lamp her form revealed;
3572,X.,"And, like the children in the field,"
3573,X.,"(For soldiers like little ones become,—"
3574,X.,"As simple in heart, as frolicsome,)"
3575,X.,"One and another breathed her name,"
3576,X.,Blessing her as she went and came.
3577,X.,
3578,X.,"5. So, through all actions pure and good,"
3579,X.,"Unknowing evil, shame, or fear,"
3580,X.,"She grew to perfect ladyhood,—"
3581,X.,Unwittingly the mate and peer

3590,XI.,"Their numberless watch-fires beacon, clear and still,"

3592,XI.,With lurid vapors that over its star-lights flit;
3593,XI.,"But wreaths of opaline cloud o’erhang, by day,"
3594,XI.,"The crystal-pointed tents, from hill to hill,"
3595,XI.,From vale to vale—until

3621,XI.,A thousand men leap when his bugles blow;
3622,XI.,"A thousand horses curvet at his lines,"
3623,XI.,Pawing the turf; among them come and go
3624,XI.,"The jacketed troopers, changed by wind and rain,"
3625,XI.,"Storm, raid, and skirmish, sunshine, midnight dew,"

3673,XII.,"Cover the lowlands far and wide,"
3674,XII.,And eastern winds blow somewhat harsh
3675,XII.,"Over the salt and mildewed marsh,"
3676,XII.,"Then the grasses take deeper root,"
3677,XII.,"Sucking, athirst and resolute;"
3678,XII.,"And when the waters eddy away,"
3679,XII.,"Flowing in trenches to Newark Bay,"
3680,XII.,"The fibrous blades grow rank and tall,"
3681,XII.,And from their tops the reed-birds call.
3682,XII.,Five miles in width the moor is spread;
3683,XII.,Two broad rivers its borders thread;
3684,XII.,The schooners which up their channels pass
3685,XII.,"Seem to be sailing in the grass,"
3686,XII.,"Save as they rise with the moon-drawn sea,"
3687,XII.,"Twice in the day, continuously."
3688,XII.,
3689,XII.,"2. Gray with an inward struggle grown,"
3690,XII.,"The brooding lawyer, Hermann Van Ghelt,"
3691,XII.,"Lived at the mansion-house, alone;"
3692,XII.,"But a chilling cloud at his bosom felt,"
3693,XII.,"Like the fog which crept, at morn and night,"
3694,XII.,"Across the rivers in his sight,"
3695,XII.,"And rising, left the moorland plain"
3696,XII.,Bare and spectral and cold again.
3697,XII.,"He saw the one tall hill, which stood"
3698,XII.,"Huge with its quarry and gloaming wood,"
3699,XII.,"And the creeping engines, as they hist"
3700,XII.,"Through the dim reaches of the mist,—"
3701,XII.,"Serpents, with ominous eyes aglow,"
3702,XII.,Thridding the grasses to and fro;
3703,XII.,"And he thought how each dark, receding train"
3704,XII.,"Carried its freight of joy and pain,"
3705,XII.,"On toil’s adventure and fortune’s quest,"
3706,XII.,To the troubled city of unrest;
3707,XII.,And he knew that under the desolate pall
3708,XII.,"Of the bleak horizon, skirting all,"
3709,XII.,"The burdened ocean heaved, and rolled"
3710,XII.,Its moaning surges manifold.
3711,XII.,
3712,XII.,"3. Often at evening, gazing through"
3713,XII.,"The eastward windows on such a view,"
3714,XII.,Its sense enwrapt him as with a shroud;
3715,XII.,"Often at noon, in the city’s crowd,"
3716,XII.,"He saw, as ’twere in a mystic glass,"
3717,XII.,Unbidden faces before him pass:
3718,XII.,"A soldier, with eyes unawed and mild"
3719,XII.,As the eyes of one who was his child;
3720,XII.,"A woman’s visage, like that which blest"
3721,XII.,A year of his better years the best;
3722,XII.,"And the plea of a voice, remembered well,"
3723,XII.,Deep in his secret hearing fell.
3724,XII.,And as week by week its records brought
3725,XII.,"Of heroes fallen as they fought,"
3726,XII.,There little by little awakenéd
3727,XII.,"In the lawyer’s heart a shapeless dread,"
3728,XII.,A fear of the tidings which of all
3729,XII.,"On ear and spirit heaviest fall,—"
3730,XII.,"Changeless sentence of mortal fate,"
3731,XII.,Freezing the marrow with—Too Late!

3735,XIII.,
3736,XIII.,"1. Thus,—when ended the morning tramp,"
3737,XIII.,"And the regiment came back to camp,"
3738,XIII.,"And the Colonel, breathing hard with pain,"
3739,XIII.,"Was carried within the lines again,—"
3740,XIII.,Thus a Color-Sergeant told
3741,XIII.,The story of that skirmish bold:
3742,XIII.,
3743,XIII.,"2. “’Twas an hour past midnight, twelve hours ago,—"
3744,XIII.,"We were all asleep, you know,"
3745,XIII.,"Save the officer on his rounds,"
3746,XIII.,"And the guard-relief,—when sounds"
3747,XIII.,The signal-gun! once—twice—
3748,XIII.,"Thrice! and then, in a trice,"
3749,XIII.,"The long assembly-call rang sharp and clear,"
3750,XIII.,Till ‘Boots and Saddles’ made us scamper like mice.
3751,XIII.,No time to waste
3752,XIII.,In asking whether a fight was near;
3753,XIII.,Over the horses went their traps in haste;
3754,XIII.,Not ten minutes had past
3755,XIII.,"Ere we stood in marching gear,"
3756,XIII.,And the call of the roll was followed by orders fast:
3757,XIII.,‘Prepare to mount!’
3758,XIII.,‘Mount!’—and the company ranks were made;
3759,XIII.,"Then in each rank, by fours, we took the count,"
3760,XIII.,And the head of the column wheeled for the long parade.
3761,XIII.,
3762,XIII.,"3. “There, on the beaten ground,"
3763,XIII.,The regiment formed from right to left;
3764,XIII.,"Our Colonel, straight in his saddle, looked around,"
3765,XIII.,"Reining the stallion in, that felt the heft"
3766,XIII.,"Of his rider, and stamped his foot, and wanted to dance."
3767,XIII.,At last the order came:
3768,XIII.,"‘By twos: forward, march!’—and the same"
3769,XIII.,From each officer in advance;
3770,XIII.,"And, as the rear-guard left the spot,"
3771,XIII.,We broke into the even trot.
3772,XIII.,
3773,XIII.,"4. “‘Trot, march!’—two by two,"
3774,XIII.,"In the dust and in the dew,"
3775,XIII.,Roads and open meadows through.
3776,XIII.,Steadily we kept the tune
3777,XIII.,Underneath the stars and moon.
3778,XIII.,"None, except the Colonel, knew"
3779,XIII.,What our orders were to do;
3780,XIII.,Whether on a forage-raid
3781,XIII.,"We were tramping, boot and blade,"
3782,XIII.,Or a close reconnoissance
3783,XIII.,Ere the army should advance;
3784,XIII.,"One thing certain, we were bound"
3785,XIII.,Straight for Stuart’s camping-ground.
3786,XIII.,"Plunging into forest-shade,"
3787,XIII.,Well we knew each glen and glade!
3788,XIII.,"Sweet they smelled, the pine and oak,"
3789,XIII.,And of home my comrade spoke.
3790,XIII.,"Tramp, tramp, out again,"
3791,XIII.,"Sheer across the ragged plain,"
3792,XIII.,Where the moonbeams glaze our steel
3793,XIII.,And the fresher air we feel.
3794,XIII.,"Thus a triple league, and more,"
3795,XIII.,"Till behind us spreads the gray,"
3796,XIII.,"Pallid light of breaking day,"
3797,XIII.,"And on cloudy hills, before,"
3798,XIII.,Rebel camp-fires smoke away.
3799,XIII.,Hard by yonder clump of pines
3800,XIII.,We should touch the rebel lines:
3801,XIII.,"‘Walk, march!’ and, softly now,"
3802,XIII.,Gain yon hillock’s westward brow.
3803,XIII.,
3804,XIII.,5. “‘Halt!’ and ‘Right into line!’—There on the ridge
3805,XIII.,In battle-order we let the horses breathe;
3806,XIII.,"The Colonel raised his glass and scanned the bridge,"
3807,XIII.,"The tents on the bank beyond, the stream beneath."
3808,XIII.,"Just then the sun first broke from the redder east,"
3809,XIII.,"And their pickets saw five hundred of us, at least,"
3810,XIII.,Stretched like a dark stockade against the sky;
3811,XIII.,We heard their long-roll clamor loud and nigh:
3812,XIII.,In half a minute a rumbling battery whirled
3813,XIII.,"To a mound in front, unlimbering with a will,"
3814,XIII.,"And a twelve-pound solid shot came right along,"
3815,XIII.,"Singing a devilish morning-song,"
3816,XIII.,"And touched my comrade’s leg, and the poor boy curled"
3817,XIII.,"And dropt to the turf, holding his bridle still."
3818,XIII.,"Well, we moved out of range,—were wheeling round,"
3819,XIII.,"I think, for the Colonel had taken his look at their ground,"
3820,XIII.,"(Thus he was ordered, it seems, and nothing more:"
3821,XIII.,Hardly worth coming at midnight for!)
3822,XIII.,"When, over the bridge, a troop of the enemy’s horse"
3823,XIII.,"Dashed out upon our course,"
3824,XIII.,Giving us hope of a tussle to warm our blood.
3825,XIII.,"Then we cheered, to a man, that our early call"
3826,XIII.,"Hadn’t been sounded for nothing, after all;"
3827,XIII.,"And halting, to wait their movements, the column stood."
3828,XIII.,
3829,XIII.,"6. “Then into squadrons we saw their ranks enlarge,"
3830,XIII.,"And slow and steady they moved to the charge,"
3831,XIII.,Shaking the ground as they came in carbine-range.
3832,XIII.,‘Front into line! March! Halt! Front!’
3833,XIII.,"Our Colonel cried; and in squadrons, to meet the brunt,"
3834,XIII.,We too from the walk to the trot our paces change:
3835,XIII.,"‘Gallop, march!’—and, hot for the fray,"
3836,XIII.,"Pistols and sabres drawn, we canter away."
3837,XIII.,
3838,XIII.,7. “Twenty rods over the slippery clover
3839,XIII.,We galloped as gayly as lady and lover;
3840,XIII.,"Held the reins lightly, our good weapons tightly,"
3841,XIII.,Five solid squadrons all shining and sightly;
3842,XIII.,"Not too fast, half the strength of our brave steeds to wasten,"
3843,XIII.,"Not too slow, for the warmth of their fire made us hasten,"
3844,XIII.,"As it came with a rattle and opened the battle,"
3845,XIII.,Tumbling from saddles ten fellows of mettle.
3846,XIII.,"So the distance grew shorter, their sabres shone broader;"
3847,XIII.,"Then the bugle’s wild blare and the Colonel’s loud order,—"
3848,XIII.,
3849,XIII.,"“CHARGE!” and we sprang, while the far echo rang,"
3850,XIII.,"And their bullets, like bees, in our ears fiercely sang."
3851,XIII.,"Forward we strode to pay what we owed,"
3852,XIII.,Right at the head of their column we rode;
3853,XIII.,"Together we dashed, and the air reeled and flashed;"
3854,XIII.,"Stirrups, sabres, and scabbards all shattered and crashed"
3855,XIII.,"As we cut in and out, right and left, all about,"
3856,XIII.,"Hand to hand, blow for blow, shot for shot, shout for shout,"
3857,XIII.,Till the earth seemed to boil with the heat of our toil.
3858,XIII.,"But in less than five minutes we felt them recoil,"
3859,XIII.,"Heard their shrill rally sound, and, like hares from the hound,"
3860,XIII.,Each ran for himself: one and all fled the ground!
3861,XIII.,"Then we goaded them up to their guns, where they cowered,"
3862,XIII.,And the breeze cleared the field where the battle-cloud lowered.
3863,XIII.,"Threescore of them lay, to teach them the way"
3864,XIII.,Van Ghelt and his rangers their compliments pay.
3865,XIII.,"But a plenty, I swear, of our saddles were bare;"
3866,XIII.,"Friend and foe, horse and rider, lay sprawled everywhere:"
3867,XIII.,"’Twas hard hitting, you see, Sir, that gained us the day!"
3868,XIII.,
3869,XIII.,"8. “Yes, they too had their say before they fled,"
3870,XIII.,And the loss of our Colonel is worse than all the rest.
3871,XIII.,"One of their captains aimed at him, as he led"
3872,XIII.,"The foremost charge—I shot the rascal dead,"
3873,XIII.,"But the Colonel fell, with a bullet through his breast."
3874,XIII.,"We lifted him from the mire, when the field was won,"
3875,XIII.,And their captured colors shaded him from the sun
3876,XIII.,In the farmer’s wagon we took for his homeward ride;
3877,XIII.,"But he never said a word, nor opened his eyes,"
3878,XIII.,"Till we reached the camp. In yon hospital tent he lies,"
3879,XIII.,And his poor young wife will come to watch by his side.
3880,XIII.,"The surgeon hasn’t found the bullet, as yet,"
3881,XIII.,But he says it’s a mortal wound. Where will you get
3882,XIII.,"Another such man to lead us, if he dies?”"
3883,XIII.,
3884,XIII.,
3885,XIV.,XIV.
3886,XIV.,
3887,XIV.,1. Sprung was the bow at last;
3888,XIV.,"And the barbed and pointed dart,"
3889,XIV.,"Keen with stings of the past,"
3890,XIV.,"Barbed with a vain remorse,"
3891,XIV.,Clove for itself a course
3892,XIV.,Straight to the father’s heart;
3893,XIV.,"And a lonely wanderer stood,"
3894,XIV.,"Mazed in a mist of thought,"
3895,XIV.,On the edge of a field of blood.
3896,XIV.,"—For a battle had been fought,"
3897,XIV.,And the cavalry skirmish was but a wild prelude
3898,XIV.,To the broader carnage that heaped a field in vain:
3899,XIV.,"A terrible battle had been fought,"
3900,XIV.,Till its changeful current brought
3901,XIV.,"Tumultuous, angry surges roaring back"
3902,XIV.,To the lines where our army had lain.
3903,XIV.,"The lawyer, driven hard by an inward pain,"
3904,XIV.,"Was crossing, in search of a dying son, the track"
3905,XIV.,"Where the deluge rose and fell, and its stranded wrack"
3906,XIV.,Had sown the loathing earth with human slain.
3907,XIV.,
3908,XIV.,"2. Friends and foes,—who could discover which,"
3909,XIV.,"As they marked the zigzag, outer ditch,"
3910,XIV.,"Or lay so cold and still in the bush,"
3911,XIV.,Fallen and trampled down in the last wild rush?
3912,XIV.,Then the shattered forest-trees; the clearing there
3913,XIV.,"Where a battery stood; dead horses, pawing the air"
3914,XIV.,With horrible upright hoofs; a mangled mass
3915,XIV.,Of wounded and stifled men in the low morass;
3916,XIV.,"And the long trench dug in haste for a burial-pit,"
3917,XIV.,Whose yawning length and breadth all comers fit.
3918,XIV.,
3919,XIV.,"3. And over the dreadful precinct, like the lights"
3920,XIV.,"That flit through graveyard walks in dismal nights,"
3921,XIV.,"Men with lanterns were groping among the dead,"
3922,XIV.,"Holding the flame to every hueless face,"
3923,XIV.,And bearing those whose life had not wholly fled
3924,XIV.,"On stretchers, that looked like biers, from the ghastly place."
3925,XIV.,
3926,XIV.,"4. The air above seemed heavy with errant souls,"
3927,XIV.,"Dense with ghosts from those gory forms arisen,—"
3928,XIV.,"Each rudely driven from its prison,"
3929,XIV.,"’Mid the harsh jar of rattling musket-rolls,"
3930,XIV.,"And quivering throes, and unexpected force;"
3931,XIV.,"In helpless waves adrift confusedly,"
3932,XIV.,Freighting the sombre haze without resource.
3933,XIV.,"Through all there trickled, from the pitying sky,"
3934,XIV.,"An infinite mist of tears upon the ground,"
3935,XIV.,Muffling the groans of anguish with its sound.
3936,XIV.,
3937,XIV.,"5. On the borders of such a land, on the bounds of Death,"
3938,XIV.,"The stranger, shuddering, moved as one who saith:"
3939,XIV.,"“God! what a doleful clime, a drear domain!”"
3940,XIV.,"And onward, struggling with his pain,"
3941,XIV.,"Traversed the endless camp-fires, spark by spark,"
3942,XIV.,"Past sentinels that challenged from the dark,"
3943,XIV.,Guided through camp and camp to one long tent
3944,XIV.,"Whose ridge a flying bolt from the field had rent,"
3945,XIV.,"Letting the midnight mist, the battle din,"
3946,XIV.,Fall on the hundred forms that writhed within.
3947,XIV.,
3948,XIV.,"6. Beyond the gaunt Zouave at the nearest cot,"
3949,XIV.,"And the bugler shot in the arm, who lay beside"
3950,XIV.,(Looking down at the wounded spot
3951,XIV.,"Even then, for all the pain, with boyish pride),"
3952,XIV.,"And a score of men, with blankets opened wide,"
3953,XIV.,Showing the gory bandages which bound
3954,XIV.,"The paths of many a deadly wound,"
3955,XIV.,—Over all these the stranger’s glances sped
3956,XIV.,"To one low stretcher, at whose head"
3957,XIV.,"A woman, bowed and brooding, sate,"
3958,XIV.,"As sit the angels of our fate,"
3959,XIV.,"Who, motionless, our births and deaths await."
3960,XIV.,"He whom she tended moaned and tost,"
3961,XIV.,"Restless, as some laborious vessel, lost"
3962,XIV.,"Close to the port for which we saw it sail,"
3963,XIV.,Groans in the long perpetual gale;
3964,XIV.,"But she, that watched the storm, forbore to weep."
3965,XIV.,Sometimes the stranger saw her move
3966,XIV.,"To others, who also with their anguish strove;"
3967,XIV.,But ever again her constant footsteps turned
3968,XIV.,To one who made sad mutterings in his sleep;
3969,XIV.,"Ever she listened to his breathings deep,"
3970,XIV.,Or trimmed the midnight lamp that feebly burned.
3971,XIV.,
3972,XIV.,
3973,XV.,XV.
3974,XV.,
3975,XV.,Leaning her face on her hand
3976,XV.,"She sat by the side of Hugh,"
3977,XV.,"Silently watching him breathe,"
3978,XV.,As a lily curves its grace
3979,XV.,Over the broken form
3980,XV.,Of the twin which stood by its side.
3981,XV.,A glory upon her head
3982,XV.,"Trailed from the light above,"
3983,XV.,Gilding her tranquil hair.
3984,XV.,"There, as she sat in a trance,"
3985,XV.,"Her soul flowed through the past,"
3986,XV.,"As a river, day and night,"
3987,XV.,"Passes through changeful shores,—"
3988,XV.,"Sees, on the twofold bank,"
3989,XV.,"Meadow and mossy grange,"
3990,XV.,"Castles on hoary crags,"
3991,XV.,"Forests, and fortressed towns,"
3992,XV.,"And shrinks from the widening bay,"
3993,XV.,And the darkness which overhangs
3994,XV.,"The unknown, limitless sea."
3995,XV.,"Was it a troubled dream,"
3996,XV.,All that the stream of her life
3997,XV.,Had mirrored along its course?
3998,XV.,All—from that summer morn
3999,XV.,When she seemed to meet in the field
4000,XV.,"One whom she vowed to love,"
4001,XV.,"And with whom she wandered thence,"
4002,XV.,Leaving the home of her youth?
4003,XV.,"Were they visions indeed,—"
4004,XV.,"The pillars of smoke and flame,"
4005,XV.,"The sound of a hundred fights,"
4006,XV.,"The grandeur, and ah! the gloom,"
4007,XV.,"The shadows which circled her now,"
4008,XV.,And the wraith of the one she loved
4009,XV.,"Gliding away from her grasp,"
4010,XV.,Vanishing swiftly and sure?
4011,XV.,"Yes, it was all a dream;"
4012,XV.,"And the strange, sad man, who moved"
4013,XV.,"To the other side of the couch,"
4014,XV.,"Bending over it long,"
4015,XV.,"Pressing his hand on his heart,"
4016,XV.,"And gazing, anon, in her eyes,—"
4017,XV.,"He, with his scanty hair,"
4018,XV.,"And pallid, repentant face,"
4019,XV.,"He, too, was a voiceless dream,"
4020,XV.,A vision like all the rest;
4021,XV.,He with the rest would fade
4022,XV.,"When the day should dawn again,"
4023,XV.,"When the spectral mist of night,"
4024,XV.,"Fused with the golden morn,"
4025,XV.,Should melt in the eastern sky.
4026,XV.,
4027,XV.,
4028,XVI.,XVI.
4029,XVI.,
4030,XVI.,1. “Steady! forward the squadron!” cries
4031,XVI.,"The dying soldier, and strives amain"
4032,XVI.,To rise from the pillow and his pain.
4033,XVI.,"Wild and wandering are his eyes,"
4034,XVI.,"Painting once more, on the empty air,"
4035,XVI.,The wrathful battle’s wavering glare.
4036,XVI.,"“Hugh!” said Alice, and checked her fear"
4037,XVI.,"“Speak to me, Hugh; your father is here.”"
4038,XVI.,“Father! what of my father? he
4039,XVI.,Is anything but a father to me;
4040,XVI.,"What need I of a father, when"
4041,XVI.,I have the hearts of a thousand men?”
4042,XVI.,"“—Alas, Sir, he knows not me nor you!”"
4043,XVI.,"And with caressing words, the twain—"
4044,XVI.,"The man with all remorsefulness,"
4045,XVI.,The woman with loving tenderness—
4046,XVI.,"Soothed the soldier to rest anew,"
4047,XVI.,"And, as the madness left his brain,"
4048,XVI.,Silently watched his sleep again.
4049,XVI.,
4050,XVI.,"2. And again the father and the wife,"
4051,XVI.,"Counting the precious sands of life,"
4052,XVI.,"Looked each askance, with those subtle eyes,"
4053,XVI.,That probe through human mysteries
4054,XVI.,And hidden motives fathom well;
4055,XVI.,"But the mild regard of Alice fell,"
4056,XVI.,"Meeting the other’s contrite glance,"
4057,XVI.,"On his meek and furrowed countenance,"
4058,XVI.,"Scathed, as it seemed, with troubled thought:"
4059,XVI.,"“Surely, good angels have with him wrought,”"
4060,XVI.,"She murmured, and halted, even across"
4061,XVI.,"The sorrowful threshold of her loss,"
4062,XVI.,"To pity his thin and changing hair,"
4063,XVI.,"And her heart forgave him, unaware."
4064,XVI.,
4065,XVI.,"3. And he,—who saw how she still represt"
4066,XVI.,"A drear foreboding within her breast,"
4067,XVI.,"And, by her wifehood’s nearest right,"
4068,XVI.,Ever more closely through the night
4069,XVI.,Clave unto him whose quickened breath
4070,XVI.,"Came like a waft from the realm of Death,—"
4071,XVI.,"He felt what a secret, powerful tie"
4072,XVI.,"Bound them in one, mysteriously."
4073,XVI.,"He studied her features, as she stood"
4074,XVI.,Lighting the shades of that woful place
4075,XVI.,"With the presence of her womanhood,"
4076,XVI.,And thought—as the dying son had thought
4077,XVI.,When her beauty first his vision caught—
4078,XVI.,“I never saw a fairer face;
4079,XVI.,I never heard a sweeter voice!”
4080,XVI.,And a sad remembrance travelled fast
4081,XVI.,"Through all the labyrinth of the past,"
4082,XVI.,"Till he said, as the scales fell off at last,"
4083,XVI.,“How could I blame him for his choice?”
4084,XVI.,"Then he looked upon the sword, which lay"
4085,XVI.,"At the headboard, under the night-lamp’s ray;"
4086,XVI.,"He saw the coat, the stains, the dust,"
4087,XVI.,"The gilded eagles worn with rust,"
4088,XVI.,The swarthy forehead and matted hair
4089,XVI.,"Of the strong, brave hero lying there;"
4090,XVI.,"And he felt how gently Hugh held command,—"
4091,XVI.,"The life how gallant, the death how grand;"
4092,XVI.,"And with trembling lips, and the words that choke,"
4093,XVI.,"And the tears which burn the cheek, he spoke:"
4094,XVI.,“Where is the father who would not joy
4095,XVI.,In the manhood of such a noble boy?
4096,XVI.,"This life, which had being through my own,"
4097,XVI.,Was a better life than I have known;
4098,XVI.,"O that its fairness should be earth,"
4099,XVI.,Ere I could prize it at its worth!”
4100,XVI.,“Too late! too late!”—he made his moan—
4101,XVI.,"“I find a daughter, and her alone."
4102,XVI.,"He deemed you worthy to bear his name,"
4103,XVI.,"His spotless honor, his lasting fame:"
4104,XVI.,"I, who have wronged you, bid you live"
4105,XVI.,To comfort the lonely—and forgive.”
4106,XVI.,
4107,XVI.,4. Dim and silvery from the east
4108,XVI.,The infant light of another morn
4109,XVI.,Over the stirring camps was borne;
4110,XVI.,"But the soldier’s pulse had almost ceased,"
4111,XVI.,And there crept upon his brow the change—
4112,XVI.,"Ah, how sudden! alas, how strange!"
4113,XVI.,"Yet again his eyelids opened wide,"
4114,XVI.,"And his glances moved to either side,"
4115,XVI.,This time with a clear intelligence
4116,XVI.,"Which took all objects in its sense,"
4117,XVI.,A power to comprehend the whole
4118,XVI.,Of the scene that girded his passing soul.
4119,XVI.,"The father, who saw it, slowly drew"
4120,XVI.,"Nearer to her that wept anew,"
4121,XVI.,"And gathered her tenderly in his hold,—"
4122,XVI.,"As mortals their precious things enfold,"
4123,XVI.,Grasping them late and sure; and Hugh
4124,XVI.,"Gazed on the two a space, and smiled"
4125,XVI.,"With the look he wore when a little child,—"
4126,XVI.,"A smile of pride and peace, that meant"
4127,XVI.,"A free forgiveness, a full content;"
4128,XVI.,Then his clouding sight an instant clung
4129,XVI.,"To the flag whose stars above him hung,"
4130,XVI.,And his blunted senses seemed to hear
4131,XVI.,The long reveillée sounding near;
4132,XVI.,But the ringing clarion could not vie
4133,XVI.,"With the richer notes which filled his ear,"
4134,XVI.,Nor the breaking morn with that brighter sky.

4143,XVII.,
4144,XVII.,"2. Let the Fates their weapons wield,"
4145,XVII.,For a wondrous woven shield
4146,XVII.,"Shall be given thee, erelong."
4147,XVII.,Mesh of gold were not so strong;
4148,XVII.,Not so soft were silken shred;
4149,XVII.,Not so fine the spider’s thread
4150,XVII.,Barring the enchanted door
4151,XVII.,"In that tale of ancient lore,"
4152,XVII.,"Guarding, silently and well,"
4153,XVII.,All within the mystic cell.
4154,XVII.,"Such a shield, where’er thou art,"

4166,XVII.,"Proud in peace, secure in war."
4167,XVII.,"For the moments never sleep,"
4168,XVII.,"Building thee a castle-keep,—"
4169,XVII.,"Proof alike ’gainst heat and cold,"
4170,XVII.,"Earthly sorrows manifold,"
4171,XVII.,"Sickness, failure of thine ends,"
4172,XVII.,And the falling off of friends.

4175,XVII.,Every day a beam is made;
4176,XVII.,Hour by hour a stone is laid.
4177,XVII.,Back the cruellest shall fall

4190,XVIII.,In pauses between our songs on the trellised porch;
4191,XVIII.,"And we sing the hymns which they loved, and almost know"
4192,XVIII.,"Their phantoms are somewhere with us, filling the gaps,"
4193,XVIII.,The sorrowful chasms left when they passed away;
4194,XVIII.,"And we seem, in the hush of our yearning voices, to hear"
4195,XVIII.,"Their warm, familiar breathing somewhere near."
4196,XVIII.,
4197,XVIII.,"2. At such an hour,—when again the autumn haze"
4198,XVIII.,"Silvered the moors, and the new moon peered from the west"
4199,XVIII.,"Over the blue Passaic, and the mansion shone"
4200,XVIII.,"Clear and white on the ridge which skirts the stream,—"
4201,XVIII.,At the twilight hour a man and a woman sat
4202,XVIII.,"On the open porch, in the garb of those who mourn."

4213,XIX.,"Silent, but oh! not sad: for the babe on the couch within"
4214,XIX.,"Drank at the mother’s breast, till the current of life, outdrawn,"

4216,XIX.,"And the gray-haired man, repenting in tears the foolish past,"

4225,XX.,The infinite ether wrapt the crispy air.
4226,XX.,"Then, arm in arm on the terrace-walk, the pair"
4227,XX.,Moved in that still communion where we feel
4228,XX.,"No need of audible questions and replies,"
4229,XX.,But mutual pulses all our thoughts reveal;
4230,XX.,"And, as they turned to leave the outer night,"
4231,XX.,Far in the cloudless North a radiant sight

4233,XX.,
4234,XX.,"2. There, through the icy mail of the boreal heaven,"
4235,XX.,Two-edged and burning swords by unseen hands
4236,XX.,"Were thrust, till a climbing throng its path had riven"
4237,XX.,"Straight from the Pole, and, over seas and lands,"
4238,XX.,"Pushed for the zenith, while from East to West"
4239,XX.,Flamed many a towering helm and gorgeous crest;
4240,XX.,"And then, a rarer pageant than the rest,"
4241,XX.,"An angrier light glared from the southern sky,"
4242,XX.,"As if the austral trumpets made reply,"
4243,XX.,And the wrath of a challenged realm had swiftly tost
4244,XX.,"On the empyrean the flags of another host,—"
4245,XX.,"Pennons with or and scarlet blazing high,"
4246,XX.,Crimson and orange banners proudly crost;
4247,XX.,"While through the environed space, that lay between"
4248,XX.,"Their adverse fronts, the ether seemed to tremble,"
4249,XX.,"Shuddering to view such ruthless foes assemble,"
4250,XX.,And one by one the stars withdrew their sheen.
4251,XX.,
4252,XX.,"3. The two, enrapt with such a vision, saw"
4253,XX.,"Its ominous surges, dense, prismatic, vast,"

4256,XX.,"The younger, fair in widow’s garments, spoke:"

4262,XX.,
4263,XX.,"4. Even as she spoke, there shone"
4264,XX.,"High in the topmost zenith a central spark,"
4265,XX.,A luminous cloud that glowed against the dark;
4266,XX.,"Its halo, widening toward either zone,"
4267,XX.,Took on the semblance of a mystic hand
4268,XX.,Stretched from an unknown height; and lo! a band
4269,XX.,"Of scintillant jewels twined around the wrist,"
4270,XX.,"Sapphire and ruby, opal, amethyst,"
4271,XX.,"Turquoise, and diamond, linked with flashing joints."
4272,XX.,"Its wide and puissant reach began to clasp,"
4273,XX.,"In countless folds, the interclashing points"
4274,XX.,"Of outshot light, gathering their angry hues—"
4275,XX.,"North, south, east, west—with noiseless grasp,"
4276,XX.,"By some divine, resistless law,"
4277,XX.,Till everywhere the wondering watchers saw
4278,XX.,"A thousand colors blend and interfuse,"

4280,XX.,"Immeasurable, white, a spotless fire;"

4351,ALECTRYÔN.,"Peopling the walls of Troas, and the tribes"
4352,ALECTRYÔN.,"Of Greece, shall sleep sweet sleep upon their arms;"
4353,ALECTRYÔN.,"For Aphroditê, queen of light and love,"
4354,ALECTRYÔN.,"Awaits me, blooming in the House of Fire,"
4355,ALECTRYÔN.,"Girt with the cestus, infinite in grace,"
4356,ALECTRYÔN.,Dearer than battle and the joy of war:
4357,ALECTRYÔN.,"She, for whose charms I would renounce the sword"
4358,ALECTRYÔN.,"Forever, even godhood, would she wreathe"
4359,ALECTRYÔN.,"My brows with myrtle, dwelling far from Heaven."
4360,ALECTRYÔN.,"Hêphæstos, the lame cuckold, unto whose"
4361,ALECTRYÔN.,"Misshapen squalor Zeus hath given my queen,"
4362,ALECTRYÔN.,"To-night seeks Lemnos, and his sooty vault"
4363,ALECTRYÔN.,"Roofed by the roaring surge; wherein, betimes,"
4364,ALECTRYÔN.,"He and his Cyclops pound the ringing iron,"
4365,ALECTRYÔN.,"Forging great bolts for Zeus, and welding mail,"
4366,ALECTRYÔN.,"White-hot, in shapes for Heroes and the Gods."
4367,ALECTRYÔN.,"Do thou, Alectryôn, faithful to my trust,"
4368,ALECTRYÔN.,Hie with me to the mystic House of Fire.
4369,ALECTRYÔN.,"Therein, with wine and fruitage of her isle,"
4370,ALECTRYÔN.,"Sweet odors, and all rarest sights and sounds,"
4371,ALECTRYÔN.,My Paphian mistress shall regale us twain.
4372,ALECTRYÔN.,"But when the feast is over, and thou seest"
4373,ALECTRYÔN.,Arês and Aphroditê pass beyond
4374,ALECTRYÔN.,The portals of that chamber whence all winds
4375,ALECTRYÔN.,"Of love flow ever toward the fourfold Earth,"
4376,ALECTRYÔN.,"Watch by the entrance, sleepless, while we sleep;"
4377,ALECTRYÔN.,And warn us ere the glimpses of the Dawn;
4378,ALECTRYÔN.,"Lest Hêlios, the spy, may peer within"
4379,ALECTRYÔN.,"Our windows, and to Lemnos speed apace,"
4380,ALECTRYÔN.,"In envy clamoring to the hobbling smith,"
4381,ALECTRYÔN.,"Hêphæstos, of the wrong I do his bed.”"
4382,ALECTRYÔN.,
4383,ALECTRYÔN.,"Thus Arês; and the Thracian boy, well pleased,"
4384,ALECTRYÔN.,"Swore to be faithful to his trust, and liege"
4385,ALECTRYÔN.,"To her, the perfect queen of light and love."
4386,ALECTRYÔN.,"So saying, they reached the fiery, brazen gates,"
4387,ALECTRYÔN.,"Encolumned high by Heaven’s artisan,"
4388,ALECTRYÔN.,"Hêphæstos, rough, begrimed, and halt of foot,—"
4389,ALECTRYÔN.,Yet unto whom was Aphroditê given
4390,ALECTRYÔN.,"By Zeus, because from his misshapen hands"
4391,ALECTRYÔN.,All shapely things found being; but the gift
4392,ALECTRYÔN.,"Brought him no joyance, nor made pure his fame,"
4393,ALECTRYÔN.,"Like those devices which he wrought himself,"
4394,ALECTRYÔN.,"Grim, patient, unbeloved."
4395,ALECTRYÔN.,
4396,ALECTRYÔN.,There passed they in
4397,ALECTRYÔN.,"At portals of the high, celestial House,"
4398,ALECTRYÔN.,"And on beyond the starry-golden court,"
4399,ALECTRYÔN.,"Through amorous hidden ways, and winding paths"
4400,ALECTRYÔN.,"Set round with splendors, to the spangled hall"
4401,ALECTRYÔN.,Of secret audience for noble guests.
4402,ALECTRYÔN.,"Here Charis labored, so Hêphæstos bade,"
4403,ALECTRYÔN.,Moulding the room’s adornments; here she built
4404,ALECTRYÔN.,"Low couches, framed in ivory, overlain"
4405,ALECTRYÔN.,"With skins of pard and panther, and the fleece"
4406,ALECTRYÔN.,Of sheep which graze the low Hesperian isles;
4407,ALECTRYÔN.,"And in the midst a cedarn table spread,"
4408,ALECTRYÔN.,Whereon the loves of all the elder Gods
4409,ALECTRYÔN.,Were wrought in gold and silver; and the light
4410,ALECTRYÔN.,Of quenchless rubies sparkled over all.
4411,ALECTRYÔN.,"Thus far came Arês and Alectryôn,"
4412,ALECTRYÔN.,"First leaving shield and falchion at the door,"
4413,ALECTRYÔN.,That naught of violence should haunt that air
4414,ALECTRYÔN.,"Serene, but laughter-loving peace, and joys"
4415,ALECTRYÔN.,"The meed of Gods, once given men to know."
4416,ALECTRYÔN.,
4417,ALECTRYÔN.,"Then, from her daïs in the utmost hall,"
4418,ALECTRYÔN.,"Shone toward them Aphroditê, not by firm,"
4419,ALECTRYÔN.,"Imperial footfalls, but in measureless"
4420,ALECTRYÔN.,"Procession, even as, wafted by her doves,"
4421,ALECTRYÔN.,She kissed the faces of the yearning waves
4422,ALECTRYÔN.,"From Cyprus to the high Thessalian mount,"
4423,ALECTRYÔN.,"Claiming her throne in Heaven; so light she stept,"
4424,ALECTRYÔN.,"Untended by her Graces; only he,"
4425,ALECTRYÔN.,"Erôs, th’ eternal child, with welcomings"
4426,ALECTRYÔN.,"Sprang forward to Arês, like a beam of light"
4427,ALECTRYÔN.,"Flashed from a coming brightness, ere it comes;"
4428,ALECTRYÔN.,And the ambrosial mother to his glee
4429,ALECTRYÔN.,"Joined her own joy, coy as she glided near"
4430,ALECTRYÔN.,"Arês, till Arês closed her in his arms"
4431,ALECTRYÔN.,"An instant, with the perfect love of Gods."
4432,ALECTRYÔN.,"And the wide chamber gleamed with their delight,"
4433,ALECTRYÔN.,And infinite tinkling laughters rippled through
4434,ALECTRYÔN.,"Far halls, wherefrom no boding echoes came."
4435,ALECTRYÔN.,
4436,ALECTRYÔN.,But when the passion of their meeting fell
4437,ALECTRYÔN.,"To dalliance, the mighty lovers, sunk"
4438,ALECTRYÔN.,"Within those ivory couches golden-fleeced,"
4439,ALECTRYÔN.,"Made wassail at the wondrous board, and held"
4440,ALECTRYÔN.,Sweet stolen converse till the middle night.
4441,ALECTRYÔN.,"And soulless servitors came gliding in,"
4442,ALECTRYÔN.,"Handmaidens, wrought of gold, the marvellous work"
4443,ALECTRYÔN.,"Of lame Hêphæstos; having neither will,"
4444,ALECTRYÔN.,"Nor voice, yet bearing on their golden trays"
4445,ALECTRYÔN.,"Lush fruits and Cyprian wine, and, intermixt,"
4446,ALECTRYÔN.,"Olympian food and nectar, earth with heaven."
4447,ALECTRYÔN.,"These Erôs and Alectryôn took therefrom,"
4448,ALECTRYÔN.,"And placed before the lovers; and, meanwhile,"
4449,ALECTRYÔN.,"Melodious breathings from unfingered lutes,"
4450,ALECTRYÔN.,"Warblings from unseen nightingales, and songs"
4451,ALECTRYÔN.,"From lips uncrimsoned, scattered music round."
4452,ALECTRYÔN.,"So fled the light-shod moments, hour by hour,"
4453,ALECTRYÔN.,While the grim husband clanged upon his forge
4454,ALECTRYÔN.,"In lurid caverns of the distant isle,"
4455,ALECTRYÔN.,"Unboding, and unheeded in his home,"
4456,ALECTRYÔN.,Save with a scornful jest. Till now the crown
4457,ALECTRYÔN.,Of Artemis shone at her topmost height:
4458,ALECTRYÔN.,"Then rose the impassioned lovers, with rapt eyes"
4459,ALECTRYÔN.,"Fixed each on each, and passed beyond the hall,"
4460,ALECTRYÔN.,Through curtains of that chamber whence all winds
4461,ALECTRYÔN.,Of love flow ever toward the fourfold Earth;
4462,ALECTRYÔN.,At whose dim vestibule Alectryôn
4463,ALECTRYÔN.,"Disposed him, mindful of his master’s word;"
4464,ALECTRYÔN.,"But Erôs, heavy-eyed, long since had slept,"
4465,ALECTRYÔN.,Deep-muffled in the softness of his plumes.
4466,ALECTRYÔN.,And all was silence in the House of Fire.
4467,ALECTRYÔN.,
4468,ALECTRYÔN.,"Only Alectryôn, through brazen bars,"
4469,ALECTRYÔN.,"Watched the blue East for Eôs, she whose torch"
4470,ALECTRYÔN.,Should warn him of the coming of the Sun.
4471,ALECTRYÔN.,"Even thus he kept his vigils; but, ere half"
4472,ALECTRYÔN.,"Her silvery downward path the Huntress knew,"
4473,ALECTRYÔN.,His senses by that rich immortal food
4474,ALECTRYÔN.,Grew numbed with languor. Then the shadowy hall’s
4475,ALECTRYÔN.,"Deep columns glimmered, interblent with dreams,—"
4476,ALECTRYÔN.,"Thick forests, running waters, darkling caves"
4477,ALECTRYÔN.,Of Thrace; and half in thought he grasped the bow;
4478,ALECTRYÔN.,"Hunted once more within his native wilds,"
4479,ALECTRYÔN.,Cheering the hounds; until before his eyes
4480,ALECTRYÔN.,"The drapery of all nearer pictures fell,"
4481,ALECTRYÔN.,"And his limbs drooped. Whereat the imp of Sleep,"
4482,ALECTRYÔN.,"Hypnos, who hid him at the outer gate,"
4483,ALECTRYÔN.,"Slid in with silken-sandalled feet, and laid"
4484,ALECTRYÔN.,"A subtle finger on his lids. And so,"
4485,ALECTRYÔN.,"Crouched at the warder-post, Alectryôn slept."
4486,ALECTRYÔN.,
4487,ALECTRYÔN.,"Meanwhile the God and Goddess, recking nought"
4488,ALECTRYÔN.,"Of evil, trusting to the faithful boy,"
4489,ALECTRYÔN.,Sank satiate in the calm of trancéd rest.
4490,ALECTRYÔN.,"And past the sleeping warder, deep within"
4491,ALECTRYÔN.,The portals of that chamber whence all winds
4492,ALECTRYÔN.,"Of love flow ever toward the fourfold Earth,"
4493,ALECTRYÔN.,"Hypnos kept on, walking, yet half afloat"
4494,ALECTRYÔN.,In the sweet air; and fluttering with cool wings
4495,ALECTRYÔN.,Above their couch fanned the reposeful pair
4496,ALECTRYÔN.,"To slumber. Thus, a careless twilight hour,"
4497,ALECTRYÔN.,"Unknowing Eôs and her torch, they slept."
4498,ALECTRYÔN.,
4499,ALECTRYÔN.,"Ill-fated rest! Awake, ye fleet-winged Loves,"
4500,ALECTRYÔN.,"Your mistress! Eôs, rouse the sleeping God,"
4501,ALECTRYÔN.,And warn him of the coming of the Day!
4502,ALECTRYÔN.,"Alectryôn, wake! In vain: Eôs swept by,"
4503,ALECTRYÔN.,"Radiant, a blushing finger on her lips."
4504,ALECTRYÔN.,"In vain! Close on her flight, from furthest East,"
4505,ALECTRYÔN.,"The peering Hêlios drove his lambent car,"
4506,ALECTRYÔN.,"Casting the tell-tale beams on earth and sky,"
4507,ALECTRYÔN.,"Until Olympos laughed within his light,"
4508,ALECTRYÔN.,And all the House of Fire grew roofed with gold;
4509,ALECTRYÔN.,And through its brazen windows Hêlios gazed
4510,ALECTRYÔN.,Upon the sleeping lovers: thence away
4511,ALECTRYÔN.,"To Lemnos flashed, across the rearward sea,"
4512,ALECTRYÔN.,"A messenger, from whom the vengeful smith,"
4513,ALECTRYÔN.,"Hêphæstos, learned the story of his wrongs;"
4514,ALECTRYÔN.,Whence afterward rude scandal spread through Heaven.
4515,ALECTRYÔN.,
4516,ALECTRYÔN.,"But they, the lovers, startled from sweet sleep"
4517,ALECTRYÔN.,"By garish Day, stood timorous and mute,"
4518,ALECTRYÔN.,"Even as a regal pair, the hart and hind,"
4519,ALECTRYÔN.,When first the keynote of the clarion horn
4520,ALECTRYÔN.,"Pierces their covert, and the deep-mouthed hound"
4521,ALECTRYÔN.,"Bays, following on the trail; then, with small pause"
4522,ALECTRYÔN.,"For amorous partings, sped in diverse ways."
4523,ALECTRYÔN.,"She, Aphroditê, clothed in pearly cloud,"
4524,ALECTRYÔN.,Dropt from Olympos to the eastern shore;
4525,ALECTRYÔN.,"Thence floated, half in shame, half laughter-pleased,"
4526,ALECTRYÔN.,"Southward across the blue Ægæan sea,"
4527,ALECTRYÔN.,That had a thousand little dimpling smiles
4528,ALECTRYÔN.,"At her discomfort, and a thousand eyes"
4529,ALECTRYÔN.,To shoot irreverent glances. But her conch
4530,ALECTRYÔN.,"Passed the Eubœan coasts, and softly on"
4531,ALECTRYÔN.,"By rugged Dêlos, and the gentler slope"
4532,ALECTRYÔN.,"Of Naxos, to Icarian waves serene;"
4533,ALECTRYÔN.,"Thence sailed betwixt fair Rhodos, on the left,"
4534,ALECTRYÔN.,"And windy Carpathos, until it touched"
4535,ALECTRYÔN.,Cyprus; and soon the conscious Goddess found
4536,ALECTRYÔN.,Her bower in the hollow of the isle;
4537,ALECTRYÔN.,And wondering nymphs in their white arms received
4538,ALECTRYÔN.,"Their white-armed mistress, bathing her fair limbs"
4539,ALECTRYÔN.,"In fragrant dews, twining her lucent hair"
4540,ALECTRYÔN.,"With roses, and with kisses soothing her;"
4541,ALECTRYÔN.,"Till, glowing in fresh loveliness, she sank"
4542,ALECTRYÔN.,"To stillness, tended in the sacred isle,"
4543,ALECTRYÔN.,And hid herself awhile from all her peers.
4544,ALECTRYÔN.,
4545,ALECTRYÔN.,"But angry Arês faced the treacherous Morn,"
4546,ALECTRYÔN.,"Spurning the palace tower; nor looked behind,"
4547,ALECTRYÔN.,Disdainful of himself and secret joys
4548,ALECTRYÔN.,That stript him to the laughter of the Gods.
4549,ALECTRYÔN.,"Toward the East he made, and overhung"
4550,ALECTRYÔN.,"The broad Thermaic gulf; then, shunning well"
4551,ALECTRYÔN.,"The crags of Lemnos, by Mount Athôs stayed"
4552,ALECTRYÔN.,"A moment, mute; thence hurtled sheer away,"
4553,ALECTRYÔN.,"Across the murmuring Northern sea, whose waves"
4554,ALECTRYÔN.,Are swollen in billows ruffled with the cuffs
4555,ALECTRYÔN.,"Of endless winds; so reached the shores of Thrace,"
4556,ALECTRYÔN.,And spleen pursued him in the tangled wilds.
4557,ALECTRYÔN.,
4558,ALECTRYÔN.,Hither at eventide remorseful came
4559,ALECTRYÔN.,"Alectryôn; but the indignant God,"
4560,ALECTRYÔN.,"With harsh revilings, changed him to the Cock,"
4561,ALECTRYÔN.,"That evermore, remembering his fault,"
4562,ALECTRYÔN.,Heralds with warning voice the coming Day.

4571,THE TEST.,"They came, for that last look, around his pyre."

4573,THE TEST.,"Her tears, like dew; and in discreet attire"

4575,THE TEST.,Warbled her tuneful sorrow. Next among

4577,THE TEST.,"Whose saintly heart no vain repinings wrung,"
4578,THE TEST.,
4579,THE TEST.,"Reached the calm dust, and there, composed and queenly,"

4581,THE TEST.,"“That’s with the past,” she said, “nor may I meanly"
4582,THE TEST.,
4583,THE TEST.,Give way to tears!” and passed into the land.
4584,THE TEST.,"The third hung feebly on the portals, moaning,"
4585,THE TEST.,"With whitened lips, and feet that stood in sand,"
4586,THE TEST.,
4587,THE TEST.,"So weak they seemed,—and all her passion owning."
4588,THE TEST.,"The fourth, a ripe, luxurious maiden, came,"

4591,THE TEST.,By smiles on one who fanned a later flame
4592,THE TEST.,"In her slight soul, her fickle steps attended."
4593,THE TEST.,The fifth and sixth were sisters; at the same
4594,THE TEST.,
4595,THE TEST.,"Wild moment both above the image bended,"
4596,THE TEST.,And with immortal hatred each on each

4599,THE TEST.,To know the dead had ’scaped the other’s reach!
4600,THE TEST.,"Meanwhile, through all the words of anguish spoken,"

4602,THE TEST.,
4603,THE TEST.,"Through all the signs of woe, no sign nor token;"

4616,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,"Shakes on the rocks and fragrant ferns, and the berry-bushes around;"

4618,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,
4619,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,"Of the Saxon months of blossom, when the merle and mavis sing,"

4627,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,Again the perfect blue of the sky; the fresh green woods; the call

4629,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,
4630,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,Sounds and shadows remembered well! the ground-bee’s droning hum;
4631,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,The distant musical tree-tops; the locust beating his drum;

4671,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,"Shadow of years! at last it sinks in the sepulchre of the past,—"

4673,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,"“For you,” I said, “be you false or true, are ever life of my life!”"
4674,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,"Was it myself or another who spoke, and asked her to be his wife?"
4675,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,
4676,THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.,"For here, on the dear old hillside, I lie at rest again,"

4701,ESTELLE.,Of all the beautiful demons who fasten on human hearts
4702,ESTELLE.,"To fetter the bodies and souls of men with exquisite, mocking arts,"
4703,ESTELLE.,"The cruellest, and subtlest, and fairest to mortal sight,"
4704,ESTELLE.,"Is surely a woman called Estelle, who tortures me day and night."
4705,ESTELLE.,
4706,ESTELLE.,"The first time that I saw her she passed with sweet lips mute,"
4707,ESTELLE.,As if in scorn of the vacant praise of those who made her suit;
4708,ESTELLE.,"A hundred lustres flashed and shone as she rustled through the crowd,"
4709,ESTELLE.,"And a passion seized me for her there,—so passionless and proud."
4710,ESTELLE.,
4711,ESTELLE.,The second time that I saw her she met me face to face;
4712,ESTELLE.,Her bending beauty answered my bow in a tremulous moment’s space;
4713,ESTELLE.,With an upward glance that instantly fell she read me through and
4714,ESTELLE.,"through,"
4715,ESTELLE.,And found in me something worth her while to idle with and subdue;
4716,ESTELLE.,
4717,ESTELLE.,"Something, I know not what: perhaps the spirit of eager youth,"
4718,ESTELLE.,"That named her a queen of queens at once, and loved her in very truth;"
4719,ESTELLE.,"That threw its pearl of pearls at her feet, and offered her, in a breath,"
4720,ESTELLE.,The costliest gift a man can give from his cradle to his death.
4721,ESTELLE.,
4722,ESTELLE.,The third time that I saw her—this woman called Estelle—
4723,ESTELLE.,She passed her milk-white arm through mine and dazzled me with her spell;
4724,ESTELLE.,"A blissful fever thrilled my veins, and there, in the moon-beams white,"
4725,ESTELLE.,I yielded my soul to the fierce control of that maddening delight!
4726,ESTELLE.,
4727,ESTELLE.,And at many a trysting afterwards she wove my heart-strings round
4728,ESTELLE.,"Her delicate fingers, twisting them, and chanting low as she wound;"
4729,ESTELLE.,The rune she sang rang sweet and clear like the chime of a witch’s bell;
4730,ESTELLE.,"Its echo haunts me even now, with the word, Estelle! Estelle!"
4731,ESTELLE.,
4732,ESTELLE.,"Ah, then, as a dozen before me had, I lay at last at her feet,"
4733,ESTELLE.,And she turned me off with a calm surprise when her triumph was all
4734,ESTELLE.,complete:
4735,ESTELLE.,"It made me wild, the stroke which smiled so pitiless out of her eyes,"
4736,ESTELLE.,"Like lightning fallen, in clear noonday, from cloudless and bluest skies!"
4737,ESTELLE.,
4738,ESTELLE.,The whirlwind followed upon my brain and beat my thoughts to rack:
4739,ESTELLE.,Who knows the many a month I lay ere memory floated back?
4740,ESTELLE.,"Even now, I tell you, I wonder whether this woman called Estelle"
4741,ESTELLE.,"Is flesh and blood, or a beautiful lie, sent up from the depths of hell."
4742,ESTELLE.,
4743,ESTELLE.,For at night she stands where the pallid moon streams into this grated
4744,ESTELLE.,"cell,"
4745,ESTELLE.,And only gives me that mocking glance when I speak her name—_Estelle_!
4746,ESTELLE.,"With the old resistless longing often I strive to clasp her there,"
4747,ESTELLE.,But she vanishes from my open arms and hides I know not where.
4748,ESTELLE.,
4749,ESTELLE.,"And I hold that if she were human she could not fly like the wind,"
4750,ESTELLE.,"But her heart would flutter against my own, in spite of her scornful"
4751,ESTELLE.,mind:
4752,ESTELLE.,"Yet, oh! she is not a phantom, since devils are not so bad"
4753,ESTELLE.,As to haunt and torture a man long after their tricks have made him mad!

5473,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Plucked from a dying stem, that one fair bud"
5474,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Put forth, and withered ere it others bore;"
5475,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And scarce the King her blossomed youth had seen,"
5476,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"When he, too, slept the sleep, and she was Queen."
5477,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5478,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Hers was a goodly realm, not stretched afar"
5479,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In desert wilds by wolf and savage scoured,"
5480,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"But locked in generous limits, strong in war,"
5481,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Serene in peace, with mountains walled and towered,"
5482,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Fed by the tilth of many a fertile plain,"
5483,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And veined with streams that proudly sought the main.
5484,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5485,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The open sea bore commerce to her marts,"
5486,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Tumbling half round her borders with its tide;
5487,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Her vessels shot the surge; all noble arts
5488,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Of use and beauty in her towns were plied;
5489,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Her court was regal; lords and ladies lit
5490,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The palace with their graces and their wit.
5491,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5492,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Wise councillors devised each apt decree
5493,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,That gained the potent sanction of her hand;
5494,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Great captains led her arms on shore and sea;

5511,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But that the woman’s heart is mistress still.
5512,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5513,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Three years she ruled a nation well content

5516,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Began to speak of marriage, and to pray"
5517,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Their sovereign not to hold herself alone,"

5523,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Like huntsmen closing round a royal deer.
5524,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"These she regarded not, but still, among"
5525,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her maids and missals, to her freedom clung."
5526,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5527,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And with the rest there came a puissant king,"

5530,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Its dearest foe through many a martial reign.
5531,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"He sued to join his hand and realm with hers,"
5532,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And end these wars; then all her ministers
5533,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5534,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Pleaded his suit; but, asking yet for grace,"
5535,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And that her hand might wait upon her heart,"
5536,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She halted, till the proud king turned his face"
5537,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Homeward; and still the people, for their part,"
5538,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Waited her choice, nor grudged her sex’s share"
5539,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Of coyness to a queen so young and fair.
5540,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5541,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,There was a little State that nestled close
5542,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Beside her boundaries, as wont to claim,"
5543,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Though free, protection there from outer foes,"
5544,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A Principality—at least in name—
5545,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Whose ruler was her father’s life-long friend
5546,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And firm ally, a statesman skilled to lend"
5547,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5548,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Shrewd counsel, and who made, in days gone by,"
5549,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A visit to this court, and with him led"
5550,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His son, a gentle Prince, of years anigh"
5551,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her own,—twelve summers shone from either head;"
5552,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And while their elders moved from place to place,—"
5553,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The field-review, the audience, the chase,—"
5554,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5555,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Princess and the Prince, together thrown,"
5556,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"With their companions held a mimic court,"
5557,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And with that sweet equality, the crown"
5558,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of Childhood,—which discovers in its sport"
5559,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"No barriers of rank or wealth or power,—"
5560,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,He named himself her consort. From that hour
5561,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5562,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The mindful Princess never quite forgot
5563,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Those joyous days, nor him, the fair-haired Prince;"
5564,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And though she well had learned her greater lot,"
5565,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And haply from his thought had passed long since
5566,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her girlish image, chance, that moves between"
5567,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Two courts, had brought his portrait to the Queen."
5568,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5569,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"This from her cabinet she took one morn,"
5570,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"When they still urged the suit of that old king,"
5571,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And said, half jesting, with a pretty scorn,"
5572,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“Why mate your wilful Queen with mouldering
5573,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And crabbed Age? Now were he shaped like this,"
5574,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"With such a face, he were not so amiss."
5575,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5576,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“Queens are but women; ’tis a sickly year
5577,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That couples frost and thaw, our minstrels sing.”—"
5578,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Ho!” thought the graybeards, “sets the wind so near?”"
5579,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And thought again: “Why not? the schemeful king
5580,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Perchance would rule us where he should be ruled;
5581,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A humbler consort will be sooner schooled.”
5582,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5583,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Forewarned are those whom Fortune’s gifts await.
5584,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Ere waned a moon the elder prince had learned—
5585,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"From half the weathercocks which gilt the state,"
5586,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Spying the wind and shifting where it turned—
5587,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,That for love’s simple sake his son could gain
5588,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The world’s chief prize, which kings had sought in vain."
5589,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5590,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,How could he choose but clutch it? Yet the son
5591,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Seemed worthy, for his parts were of that mould"
5592,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Oft-failing Nature strives to join in one,"
5593,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And shape a hero,—pure and wise and bold:"
5594,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In arts and arms the wonder of his peers,"
5595,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The flower of princes, prince of cavaliers;"
5596,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5597,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Tall, lithe of form, and of a Northern mien,"
5598,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Gentle in speech and thought,—while thus he shone,"
5599,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A rising star, though chosen of a queen,"
5600,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Why seek the skies less tranquil than his own?
5601,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Why should he climb beside her perilous height,"
5602,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And in that noonday blaze eclipse his light?
5603,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5604,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Ah, why?—one’s own life may be bravely led,"
5605,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"But not another’s. Yet, as to and fro"
5606,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The buzzing private embassies were sped,"
5607,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And when the Queen’s own pages, bowing low,"
5608,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Told in his ear a sweet and secret story,"
5609,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Prince, long trained to seek his house’s glory,"
5610,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5611,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Let every gracious sentence seem a plume

5613,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,So passed a season; then the cannon’s boom
5614,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And belfry’s peal delivered to the realm
5615,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Queen’s betrothal, and the councils met,"
5616,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And for the nuptial rites a day was set.

5622,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His loss, and past the boundaries; and, since"
5623,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To ape the pomp to which he was not born
5624,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Seemed in his soul a foolish thing and vain,"
5625,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A few near comrades, only, made his train."
5626,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5627,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Nor pressed the populace along the ways;
5628,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But—for he wished it so—unheralded
5629,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"He rode from post to post through many days,"
5630,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Yet gained a greatness as the distance fled,"
5631,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"As some dim comet, drawing near its bound,"
5632,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Takes lustre from the orb it courses round.
5633,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5634,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And league by league his fantasies outran
5635,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His progress, brooding on his mistress’ power,"
5636,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Until his own estate the while began
5637,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To seem of lesser worth each passing hour;
5638,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And with misdoubt this fortune weighed him down,"
5639,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,As though a splendid mantle had been thrown
5640,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5641,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"About him, which he knew not well to wear,"
5642,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And might not forfeit. Yet he spurred apace,"
5643,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And reached a country-seat that bordered near
5644,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Capital. Here, for a little space,"
5645,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"He was to rest from travel, and await"
5646,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,His day of entrance at the city’s gate.
5647,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5648,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Upon these grounds a gray-haired noble dwelt,"

5650,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A tedious proper man, who glibly knelt"
5651,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To royalty,—this ancient chamberlain,—"
5652,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Yoked with a girlish wife, and, for the rest,"
5653,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Proud of the charge that made a prince his guest.

5655,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The highway ran beside a greenwood keep
5656,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That reached, herefrom, quite to the city’s edge;"
5657,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Across, the fields with golden corn were deep;"
5658,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The level sunset pierced the wayside hedge;
5659,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The banks were all abloom; a pheasant whirred
5660,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Far in the bush; anon, some tuneful bird"
5661,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5662,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Broke into song, or, from a covert dark,"
5663,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A bounding deer its dappled haunches showed
5664,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,As though it heard the stag-hound’s distant bark.
5665,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The wistful Prince with loitering purpose bode,"
5666,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And thought how good it were to spend one’s life
5667,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Far off from men, nor jostled with their strife."
5668,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5669,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Even as he mused he saw his host ahead,"
5670,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Speeding to welcome him, in lordly wont,"
5671,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And all the household in a line bestead;
5672,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And lightly with that escort, at the front,"
5673,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A peerless woman rode across the green;
5674,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then the Prince thought, “It surely is the Queen,"
5675,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5676,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Who comes to meet me of her loving grace!”
5677,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And his blood mounted; but he knew how fair
5678,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The royal locks, and, when she neared his place,"
5679,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,He saw the lady’s prodigal dark hair
5680,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And wondrous loveliness were wide apart

5682,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5683,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And when the chamberlain, with halted suit,"

5685,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The lady to her knightly guest’s salute
5686,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Turned her face full, so that he marked her eyes,—"
5687,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"How dewy gray beneath each long, black lid,"
5688,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And danger somewhere in their light lay hid.
5689,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5690,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,There are some natures housed so chaste within
5691,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Their placid dwellings that their heads control
5692,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The tumult of their hearts; and thus they win
5693,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A quittance from this pleading of the soul
5694,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"For Love, whose service does so wound and heal;"
5695,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,How should they crave for what they cannot feel?

5702,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And the high winds are vocal with desire.

5735,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her beauteous head askance, yet wist full well"
5736,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"How the Prince looked and spoke; unwittingly,"
5737,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"With the strange female sense and secret eye,"
5738,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5739,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Made of him there her subtile estimate,"
5740,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Forecast his lot, and thought how all things flow"
5741,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To those who have a surfeit. Could the great,"
5742,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The perfect Queen, she marvelled, truly know"
5743,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And love him at his value? In his turn,"
5744,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,He read her face as ’twere a marble urn
5745,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5746,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Embossed with Truth and blushful Innocence,"
5747,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Yet with the wild Loves carven in repose;
5748,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And as he looked he felt, and knew not whence,"
5749,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A thought like this come as the wind that blows:
5750,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“A face to lose one’s life for; ay, and more,"
5751,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To live for!”—So they reached the sculptured door
5752,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5753,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And casements gilded with the dying light.
5754,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That eve the host spread out a stately board,"
5755,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And with his household far into the night
5756,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Feasted the Prince. The lady, next her lord,"
5757,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Drooped like a musk-rose trained beside a tomb.
5758,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Loath was the guest that night to seek his room.
5759,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5760,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,*       *       *       *       *
5761,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5762,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Ah! wherefore tell again an oft-told tale,—"
5763,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,That of the sleeping knight who lost his wage
5764,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In the enchanted land, though cased with mail,"
5765,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And bore the sacred shrine an empty gage?
5766,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,How this thing went it were not worth to view
5767,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But for the triple coil which thence outgrew;
5768,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5769,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"How, with the morn, the ancient chamberlain"
5770,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Made off, and on the marriage business moved;"
5771,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,How day by day those young hearts fed amain
5772,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Upon the food of lovers, till—they loved."
5773,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Beneath the mists of duty and degree
5774,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A warmth of passion crept deliciously
5775,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5776,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"About the twain; and there, within the gleam"
5777,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of those gray languid eyes, his nearing fate"
5778,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Seemed to the one a far, unquiet dream."
5779,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So when the heralds said, “All things await"
5780,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Your princely coming,” the glad summons broke"
5781,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Upon him like a harsh bell’s jangling stroke,"
5782,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5783,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And waked him, and he knew he must be gone"
5784,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And put that honeyed chalice quite away;
5785,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Yet once more met the lady, and alone,"
5786,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"It chanced, within the grounds. The two, that day,"
5787,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Lured by a falling water’s sound, went deep"
5788,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Beyond the sunlight, in the forest-keep."
5789,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5790,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Here from a range of wooded uplands leapt
5791,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A mountain brook and far-off meadows sought;
5792,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Now under firs and tasselled chestnuts crept,"
5793,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then on through jagged rocks a passage fought,"
5794,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Until it clove this shadowy gorge and cool
5795,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In one white cataract,—with a dark, broad pool"
5796,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5797,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Beneath, the home of mottled trout. One side"
5798,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Rose the cliff’s hollowed height, and overhung"
5799,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,An open sward across that basin wide.
5800,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The liberal sun through slanting larches flung
5801,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Rich spots of gold upon the tufted ground,"
5802,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And the great royal forest gloomed around.
5803,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5804,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Prince, divided from the world so far,"
5805,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Sat with the lady on a fallen tree;
5806,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"They looked like lovers, yet a prison-bar"
5807,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Between them had not made the two less free.
5808,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Only their eyes told what they could not say,"
5809,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,For still their lips spoke alien words that day.
5810,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5811,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,She told a legend of an early king
5812,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Who knew the fairy of this wildwood glen,"
5813,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And often sought her haunt, far off to fling"
5814,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His grandeur, and be loved like common men."
5815,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"He died long since, the lady said; but she,"
5816,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Who could not die, how weary she must be!"
5817,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5818,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"They talked of the strange beauty of the spot,"
5819,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The light that glinted through the ancient trees,"
5820,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Their own young lives, the Prince’s future lot;"
5821,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then jested with false laughs. Like tangled bees,"
5822,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Each other and themselves they sweetly stung;
5823,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"They sung fond songs, and mocked the words they sung."
5824,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5825,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,At last he hung his picture by a chain
5826,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"About her neck, and on it graved the date."
5827,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Her merry eyes grew soft with tender pain;
5828,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She heard him sigh, “Alas, by what rude fate"
5829,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Our lives, like ships at sea, an instant meet,"
5830,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Then part forever on their courses fleet!”
5831,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5832,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And in sheer pity of herself she dropped
5833,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her lovely head; and, though with self she strove,"
5834,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"One hot tear fell. The shadow, which had stopped"
5835,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"On her life’s dial, moved again, and Love"
5836,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Went sobbing by, and only left his wraith;"
5837,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,For both were loyal to their given faith.
5838,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5839,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Farewells they breathed and self-reproaches found,"
5840,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Half gliding with the current to the fall,"
5841,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Yet struggling for the shore. Was she not bound?
5842,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Did not his plighted future, like a wall,"
5843,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Jut ’cross the stream? They feared themselves, and rose,"
5844,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And through the forest gained the mansion-close
5845,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5846,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Unmissed, and parted thus, nor met anew;"
5847,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"For on the morrow, when the Prince took horse,"
5848,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The lady feigned an illness, or ’twas true,—"
5849,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Yet maybe from her oriel marked his course,"
5850,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Watching his plume, that into distance past,"
5851,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Like some dear sail which sinks from sight at last.
5852,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5853,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"He rode beneath their arch, where pennons flared"
5854,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And standards with his colors blazoned in.
5855,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Then thousands shouted welcome; trumpets blared;
5856,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,He felt the glories of his life begin!
5857,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Far, far behind, that eddy in its stream"
5858,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Now seemed; its vanished shores, in turn, a dream."
5859,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5860,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Enough; he passed the ways and reached the Queen.
5861,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,With pomp and pageantry the vows were said
5862,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Leave to the chroniclers the storied scene,"
5863,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The church, the court, the masks and jousts that sped;"
5864,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Not theirs, but ours, to follow Love apart,"
5865,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Where first the bridegroom held his bride to heart,"
5866,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5867,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And saw her purity and regnant worth
5868,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Thus kept for him and yielded to his care.
5869,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,What marvel that of all who dwelt on earth
5870,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,He seemed most fortunate and she most fair
5871,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That self-same hour? And “By God’s grace,” he thought,"
5872,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“May I to some ignoble end be brought,"
5873,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5874,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Unless I so reward her for her choice,"
5875,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And shape my future conduct in this land
5876,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"By her deserving, that the world’s great voice"
5877,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Proclaim me not unworthy! Let my hand
5878,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Henceforward make her tasks its own; my life
5879,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Be merged in this fair ruler, precious wife,"
5880,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5881,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“The paragon and glory of her kind!”
5882,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Who reads his own heart will not think it strange
5883,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,He put that yester romance from his mind
5884,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So readily. Men’s lives, like oceans, change"
5885,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In shifting tides, and ebb from either shore"
5886,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Till the strong planet draws them on once more.
5887,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5888,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,*       *       *       *       *
5889,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5890,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And as a pilgrim, shielded by the wings"
5891,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of some bright angel, crosses perilous ground,"
5892,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Through unknown ways, and, while she leads and sings,"
5893,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Forgets the past, nor sees what pits surround"
5894,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His footsteps, so the young Prince cast away"
5895,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That self-distrust, and with his sovereign May"
5896,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5897,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The gladness joined, and with her sat in state,"
5898,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Beneath the ancient scutcheons of her throne,"
5899,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And welcome gave, and led the revels late;"
5900,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But when the still and midnight heavens shone
5901,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"They fled the masquers, and the city’s hum"
5902,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Was silent, and the palace halls grew dumb,"
5903,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5904,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And Love and Sleep in that serene eclipse
5905,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Moved, making prince and clown of one degree,"
5906,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Then was she all his own; then from her lips
5907,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,He learned with what a sweet humility
5908,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She, whose least word a spacious kingdom ruled,"
5909,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,In Love’s free vassalage would fain be schooled.
5910,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5911,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"How poor, she said, her sovereignty seemed,"
5912,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Unless it made her richer in his eye!
5913,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And poor his life, until her sunlight beamed"
5914,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Upon it, said the Prince. So months went by;"
5915,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,They were a gracious pair; the Queen was glad;
5916,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Peace smiled, and the wide land contentment had."
5917,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5918,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And for a time the courteous welcome paid
5919,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The chosen consort, and the people’s joy"
5920,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In the Queen’s joy, kept silent those who weighed"
5921,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Prince’s make, and sought to find alloy"
5922,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In his fine gold; but, when the freshness fled"
5923,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"From these things told, some took new thought and said:"
5924,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5925,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“Look at the Queen: her heart is wholly set
5926,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Upon the Prince! what if he warp her mind
5927,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To errant policies, and rule us yet"
5928,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,By proxy?” “What and if he prove the kind
5929,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of trifling gallant,” others said, “to slight"
5930,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Our mistress, for each new and base delight?"
5931,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5932,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Ay, we will watch him, lest he do her wrong!”"
5933,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And his due station, even from the first,"
5934,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The peers of haughty rank and lineage long,"
5935,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Jealous of one whose blossom at a burst
5936,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Outflamed their own, begrudged him; till their pique"
5937,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"grew plain, and sent proud color to his cheek."
5938,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5939,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So now he fared as some new actor fares,"
5940,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Who through dark arras gains the open boards,"
5941,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Facing the lights, and feels a thousand stares"
5942,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Come full upon him; and the great throng hoards
5943,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Its plaudits; and, as he begins his tale,"
5944,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,His rivals wait to mock him if he fail.
5945,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5946,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But here a brave simplicity of soul
5947,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And careless vigilance, by honor bred,"
5948,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Stayed him, and o’er his actions held control."
5949,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A host of generous virtues stood in stead,"
5950,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To help him on; with patient manliness
5951,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"He kept his rank, no greater and no less;"
5952,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5953,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,His life was as a limpid rivulet;
5954,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His thoughts, like golden sands, were through it seen,"
5955,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Not on himself in poor ambition set,"
5956,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But on his chosen country and the Queen;
5957,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And with such gentle tact he bore a sense
5958,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of conduct due, nor took nor gave offence,"
5959,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5960,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That, as time went, he earned their trust, who first"
5961,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Withheld it him, and brought them, one by one,"
5962,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To seek him for a comrade; but he nursed
5963,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,His friendships with such equal care that none
5964,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Could claim him as their own; nor was his word
5965,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Of counsel dulled by being often heard;
5966,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5967,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Nor would he sully his fresh youth among
5968,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The roisterers and pretty wanton dames
5969,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Who strove to win him; nor with ribald tongue
5970,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Joined in the talk that round a palace flames;
5971,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Nor came and went alone, save—’twas his wont"
5972,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,In his own land—he haply left the hunt
5973,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5974,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"On forest days, and, plunging down the wood,"
5975,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,There in the brakes and copses half forgot
5976,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The part he bore, and caught anew the mood"
5977,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of youth, and felt a heart for any lot;"
5978,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then, loitering cityward behind the train,"
5979,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,With fresher courage took his place again.
5980,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5981,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,His pure life made the wits about the court
5982,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Find in its very blamelessness a fault
5983,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,That lacked the generous failings of their sort.
5984,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“With so much sweet,” they swore, “a grain of salt"
5985,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Were welcome! lighter tongue and freer mood
5986,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Were something more of man, if less of prude!”"
5987,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5988,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And others to his praises would oppose
5989,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Suspicion of his prowess, and they said,"
5990,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Our rose of princes is a thornless rose,"
5991,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A woman’s toy!” and, when the months were sped,"
5992,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And the glad Queen was childed with a son,"
5993,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Light jests upon his mission well begun
5994,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
5995,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"They bandied; yet the Prince, who felt the sting,"
5996,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Bided his time. Till on the land there brake
5997,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A sudden warfare; for that haughty king,"
5998,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Gathering a mighty armament to take
5999,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Revenge for his lost suit, with sword and flame"
6000,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Against the borders on short pretext came.
6001,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6002,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Then with hot haste the Queen’s whole forces poured
6003,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To meet him. With the call to horse and blade
6004,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Prince, deep-chafed in spirit, placed his sword"
6005,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"At orders of the General, and prayed"
6006,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A humble station, but, as due his rank,"
6007,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Next in command was made, and led the flank."
6008,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6009,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And so with doubtful poise a fierce war raged,"
6010,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Till on a day encountered face to face
6011,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The two chief hosts, and dreadful battle waged"
6012,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To close the issue. In its opening space
6013,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Death smote the General, and in tumult sore"
6014,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The line sank back; but swiftly, at the fore"
6015,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6016,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Placing himself, the Prince right onward hurled"
6017,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The strife once more, and with his battle-shout"
6018,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Woke victory; again his forces whirled
6019,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The hostile troops, and drove them on in rout."
6020,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The strength of ten battalions seemed to yield
6021,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Before his arm; and so he won that field,"
6022,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6023,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And slew with his own hand the vengeful king,"
6024,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And with that death-stroke brought the war to end,"
6025,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Conquering the common foe, and conquering"
6026,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The hate, from which he would not else defend"
6027,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,His clear renown than with such manful deeds
6028,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,As fall to faith and valor at their needs.
6029,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6030,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Again—this time the chaplet was his own—
6031,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The people wreathed their laurels for his brow;
6032,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,His horses trod on flowers; the city shone
6033,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,With flags of victory; and none but now—
6034,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,As with no vaunting mien he wore his bays—
6035,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Confessed him brave as good, and gave their praise."
6036,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6037,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Peace smiled anew; the kingdom was at rest.
6038,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Ah, happy Queen! whom every matron’s tongue"
6039,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Ran envious of, with such a consort blest"
6040,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"As wins the heart of women, old and young;"
6041,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So gallant, yet so good, the gentlest maid"
6042,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,By this fair standard her own suitor weighed.
6043,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6044,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"I hold the perfect mating of two souls,"
6045,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Through wedded love, to be the sum of bliss."
6046,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"When Earth, this fruit that ripens as it rolls"
6047,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In sunlight, grows more prime, lives will not miss"
6048,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Their counterparts, and each shall find its own;"
6049,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But now with what blind chance the lots are thrown!
6050,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6051,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And because Love sets with a rising tide
6052,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Along the drift where much has gone before
6053,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"One holds of worth,—we lavish first, beside,"
6054,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Heart, honors, regal gifts, and love the more"
6055,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"When yielding most,—for this the Queen’s love knew"
6056,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"No slack, but still its current deeper grew."
6057,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6058,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And because Love is free, and follows not"
6059,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"On gratitude, nor comes from what is given"
6060,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So much as on the giving; and, I wot,"
6061,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Partly because it irks one to have thriven
6062,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"At hands which seem the weaker, and should thrive"
6063,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,While those of him they cling to lift and strive;
6064,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6065,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And partly that his marriage seemed a height
6066,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Which raised him from the passions of our kind,"
6067,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Nor with his own intent; and that, despite"
6068,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Its clear repose, he somehow longed to find"
6069,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The lower world, starve, hunger, and be fed"
6070,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"With joy and sorrow, sweet and bitter bread,—"
6071,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6072,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,For all these things the Prince loved not the Queen
6073,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,With that sufficience which alone can take
6074,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A rapture in itself and rest serene;
6075,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Yet knew not what his life lacked that should make
6076,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"It worth to live,—our custom has such art"
6077,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To dull the craving of the famished heart,—"
6078,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6079,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Perchance had never known it, but a light"
6080,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Flashed in his path and lit a fiery train
6081,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"About him; else, day following day, and night"
6082,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"By night, through years his soul had felt no pain,"
6083,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"No triumph, but had shared the common lull,"
6084,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Been all it seemed, as blameless, true, and dull."
6085,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6086,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And yet in one fair woman beauty, youth,"
6087,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And passion were united, and her love"
6088,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Was framed about his likeness. Some, forsooth,"
6089,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"May shift their changeful worship as they rove,"
6090,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Or clowns or princes; but her fancy slept,"
6091,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Dreaming upon that picture which she kept,"
6092,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6093,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A secret pain and pleasance. With what strife
6094,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Men sought her love she wist not, for the prize"
6095,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Was not for them. She lived a duteous life.
6096,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,’Twas something thus to let her constant eyes
6097,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Feed on his face, to hear his name,—to know"
6098,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"He lived, had walked those paths, had loved her so."
6099,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6100,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,There is a painting of a youthful monk
6101,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Who sits within a walled and cloistered nook,"
6102,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His breviary closed, and listens, sunk"
6103,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In day-dreams, to a viol,—with a look"
6104,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of strange regret fixed on two pairing doves,"
6105,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Who find their fate and simple natural loves.
6106,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6107,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Yet bonds of gold, linked hands, and chancel vows,"
6108,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Even spousal beds, do not a marriage make."
6109,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,When such things chain the soul that never knows
6110,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Love’s mating, little vantage shall it take,"
6111,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Wandering with alien feet throughout the wide,"
6112,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Hushed temple, over those who pine outside!"
6113,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6114,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,So this young wife forecast her horoscope
6115,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And found its wedded lines of little worth,"
6116,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Yet owned not to herself what hopeless hope
6117,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Or dumb intent made green her spot of earth.
6118,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So passed three changeless years, as such years be;"
6119,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"At last the old lord died, and left her free,"
6120,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6121,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The mistress of his rank and broad estate,"
6122,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,In honor of her constancy. Then life
6123,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Rushed back; she saw her beauty grown more great,"
6124,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Ripened as if a summer field were rife
6125,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"With grain, the harvester neglectful, since"
6126,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Hers was no mean desire that sought a prince,"
6127,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6128,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Eager to make his birth and bloom her own,"
6129,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Or reign a wanton favorite. But she thought,"
6130,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“I might have loved and clung to him alone,"
6131,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Am fairer than he knew me; yet, if aught"
6132,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of rarity make sweet my hair and lips,"
6133,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,What sweetness hath the honey that none sips?”
6134,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6135,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"After her time of mourning she grew bold,"
6136,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And said, “Once let me look upon his face!"
6137,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The Queen will take no harm if I behold
6138,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"What all the world can see.” She left her place,"
6139,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And with a kinsman, at a palace rout,"
6140,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Followed the long line passing in and out
6141,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6142,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Before the dais. The Prince’s eyes and hers
6143,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Met like the clouds that lighten. In a breath
6144,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Swift memory flamed between them, as, when stirs"
6145,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"No wind, and the dark sky is still as death,"
6146,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,One lance of living fire is hurled across;
6147,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then comes the whirlwind, and the forests toss!"
6148,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6149,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Yet as she bent her beauteous shoulders down,"
6150,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And heard the kindly greeting of the Queen,"
6151,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,He spoke such words as one who wears a crown
6152,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Speaks, and no more; and with a low, proud mien"
6153,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She murmured answer, from the presence past"
6154,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Lightly, nor any look behind her cast."
6155,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6156,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,In that first glimpse each read the other’s heart;
6157,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But not without a summoning of himself
6158,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To judgment did the Prince forever part
6159,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"From truth and fealty. As he pondered, still"
6160,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"With stronger voice Love claimed a debt unpaid,"
6161,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And youth’s hot pulses would not be gainsaid.
6162,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6163,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She with a fierce, full gladness saw again"
6164,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Their broken threads of love begin to spin
6165,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In one red strand, and let it guide her then,"
6166,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Whether it led to danger or to sin;
6167,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And shortly, on the morrow, took the road,"
6168,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And gained her country-seat, and there abode."
6169,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6170,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Prince, a bright near morning, mounted horse,"
6171,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Garbed for the hunt, and left the town, and through"
6172,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The deep-pathed wood rode on a wayward course,"
6173,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"With a set purpose in him,—though he knew"
6174,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"It not, and let his steed go where it might;"
6175,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,For this sole thought pursued him since that night:—
6176,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6177,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“What recompense for me who have not sown
6178,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The seed and reaped the harvest of my days?
6179,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Youth passes like a bird; but love alone
6180,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Makes wealth of riches, power of rank, men’s praise"
6181,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A goodly sound. Of such things have I aught?
6182,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,There is a foil to make their substance naught.
6183,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6184,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“What were his gifts who made each lovely thing,"
6185,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Yet lacked the gift of love? or what the fame
6186,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of some dwarfed poet, whose numbers still we sing,"
6187,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,If no fair woman trembled where he came?
6188,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The beggar dying in ditch is not accurst
6189,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,If love once crowned him! Fate may do her worst.
6190,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6191,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“For Age that erst has drawn the wine of love
6192,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And filled its birth-cup to the jewelled brim,"
6193,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And, while it sparkled, held it high above,"
6194,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And drained it slowly, swiftly,—then, though dim"
6195,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Grow the blurred eyes, and comfort and desire"
6196,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Are but the ashes of their ancient fire,"
6197,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6198,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Yet will it bide its exit in content,"
6199,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Remembering the past, nor grudge, with hoar"
6200,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And ravenous look, the youth we have not spent."
6201,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,No earthly sting has power to harm it more;
6202,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"It lived and loved, was young, and now is old,"
6203,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And life is rounded like a ring of gold.”
6204,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6205,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Thereat with sudden rein the Prince wheeled horse,"
6206,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And sought a pathway that he long had known
6207,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Yet shunned till now. Beside a water-course
6208,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,It led him for a winding league and lone;
6209,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then made a rugged circuit,—where the brook"
6210,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Down a steep ledge of rock its plunges took,—"
6211,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6212,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And ended at an open sward, the same"
6213,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Against whose edge the leaping cataract fell
6214,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,From those high cliffs. Five years ago he came
6215,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To bury youth and love within that dell,"
6216,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And, as again he reached the spot he sought,"
6217,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Truth, fame, his child, the Queen, were all as naught."
6218,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6219,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Dismounting then, he pushed afoot, between"
6220,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The alder saplings, to the outer wood,"
6221,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The grounds, the garden-walks, and found, unseen,"
6222,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A private door, nor tarried till he stood"
6223,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Within the threshold of my Lady’s room,—"
6224,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A shadowed nook, all stillness and perfume."
6225,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6226,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Jasmine and briony the lattice climbed,"
6227,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The rose and honeysuckle trailed above;
6228,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"’Twas such an hour as poets oft have rhymed,"
6229,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And such a chamber as all lovers love.
6230,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"He found her there, and at her footstool knelt."
6231,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Each in the other’s fancies had so dwelt,"
6232,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6233,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That, as one sees for days a sweet strange face,"
6234,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Until at night in dreams he does caress
6235,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Its owner, and next morning in some place"
6236,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Meets her, and wonders if she too can guess"
6237,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"How near and known he thinks her,—in this wise"
6238,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,They read one story in each other’s eyes.
6239,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6240,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Her thick hair falling from its lilies hid
6241,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Their first long kiss of passion and content.
6242,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"He heard her soft, glad murmur, as she slid"
6243,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Within his hold, and ’gainst his bosom leant,"
6244,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Whispering: “At last! at last! the years were sore.”
6245,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Their spite,” he said, “shall do us wrong no more!”"
6246,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6247,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"What else, when mingled longings swell full-tide,"
6248,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And the heart’s surges leap their bounds for aye,"
6249,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And fell the landmarks? What but fate defied,"
6250,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Time clutched, and any future held at bay?"
6251,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"They recked not of the thorn, but seized the flower;"
6252,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"For all the sin, their joy was great that hour."
6253,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6254,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And since, for all the joy, theirs was a sin"
6255,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,That baned them with one bane; since many men
6256,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Had sought her love, but one alone could win"
6257,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That largess, with his blameless life till then"
6258,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Inviolate,—they bargained for love’s sake"
6259,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,No severance of their covert league to make.
6260,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6261,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Yet, since nobility compelled them still,"
6262,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,They pledged themselves for honor’s sake to hold
6263,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,This hidden unto death; at either’s will
6264,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To meet and part in secret; to infold
6265,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In their own hearts their trespass and delight,"
6266,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Nor look their love, but guard it day or night."
6267,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6268,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,*       *       *       *       *
6269,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6270,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,So fell the blameless Prince. That day more late
6271,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Than wont he reached the presence of the Queen,"
6272,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Deep in a palace chamber, where she sate"
6273,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Fondling his child. The sunset lit her mien,"
6274,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And made a saintly glory in her hair;
6275,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,An awe came on him as he saw her there.
6276,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6277,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And, because perfect love suspecteth not,"
6278,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,She found no blot upon his brow. ’Twas good
6279,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To take a pleasure in her wedded lot,"
6280,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And watch the infant creeping where he stood;
6281,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And, as he bent his head, she little wist"
6282,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,What kisses burned upon the lips she kissed.
6283,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6284,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And he, still kind and wise in his decline,"
6285,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Seeing her trustful calm, had little heart"
6286,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To shake it. So his conduct gave no sign
6287,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Of broken faith; no slurring of his part
6288,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Betrayed him to the courtiers or the wife.
6289,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Perhaps a second spring-time in his life
6290,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6291,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Waxed green, and fresh-bloomed love renewed again"
6292,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The joys that light our youth and leave our prime,"
6293,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And women found him tenderer, and men"
6294,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A blither, heartier comrade; but, meantime,"
6295,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,What hidden gladness made his visage bright
6296,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,They could not guess; nor with what craft and sleight
6297,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6298,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The paramours, in fealty to that Love"
6299,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Who laughs at locks and walks in hooded guise,"
6300,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Met here and there, yet made no careless move"
6301,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Nor bared their strategy to cunning eyes.
6302,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And though, a portion of the winter year,"
6303,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The Queen’s own summons brought her rival near
6304,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6305,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Prince, among the ladies of her train,"
6306,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then, meeting face to face at morn and night,"
6307,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,They were as strangers. If it was a pain
6308,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To pass so coldly on, in love’s despite,"
6309,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"It was a joy to hear each other’s tone,"
6310,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And keep the life-long secret still their own.
6311,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6312,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Once having dipped their palms they drank full draught,"
6313,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And, like the desert-parched, alone at first"
6314,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Felt the delight of drinking, while they quaffed"
6315,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,As if the waters could not slake their thirst;
6316,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That nicer sense unreached, when down we fling,"
6317,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And view the oasis around the spring.
6318,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6319,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And, in that first bewilderment, perchance"
6320,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Prince’s lapse had caught some peering eye,"
6321,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"But that his long repute, and maintenance"
6322,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Against each test, had put suspicion by."
6323,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Now no one watched or doubted him. So long
6324,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His inner strength had made his outwork strong,"
6325,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6326,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So long had smoothed his face, ’twas light to take,"
6327,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"From what had been his blamelessness, a mask."
6328,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And still, for honor’s and the country’s sake,"
6329,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,He set his hands to every noble task;
6330,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Held firmly yet his place among the great,"
6331,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Won by the sword and saviour of the state;
6332,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6333,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And as in war, so now in civic peace,"
6334,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"He led the people on to higher things,"
6335,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And fostered Art and Song, and brought increase"
6336,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of Knowledge, gave to Commerce broader wings,"
6337,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And with his action strengthened fourfold more
6338,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The weight his precept in their councils bore.
6339,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6340,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then as the mellow years their fruitage brought,"
6341,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And fair strong children made secure the throne,"
6342,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"He reared them wisely, heedfully; and sought"
6343,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Their good, the Queen’s desire, and these alone."
6344,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Himself so pure, that fathers bade their sons,"
6345,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Observe the Prince, who every license shuns;"
6346,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6347,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Who, being most brave, is purest!” Wedded wives,"
6348,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Happy themselves, the Queen still happiest found,"
6349,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And plighted maids still wished their lovers’ lives
6350,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Conformed to his. Such manhood wrapt him round,"
6351,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So winsome were his grace and knightly look,"
6352,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The dames at court their lesser spoil forsook,"
6353,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6354,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And wove a net to snare him, and their mood"
6355,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Grew warmer for his coldness; and the hearts
6356,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of those most heartless beat with quicker blood,"
6357,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Foiled of his love; yet, heedless of their arts,"
6358,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Courteous to all, he went his way content,"
6359,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Nor ever from his princely station bent.
6360,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6361,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“What is this charm,” they asked, “that makes him chaste"
6362,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Beyond all men?” and wist not what they said.
6363,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The common folk,—because the Prince had cased"
6364,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His limbs in silver mail, and on his head"
6365,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Worn snowy plumes, and, covered thus in white,"
6366,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Shone in the fiercest turmoil of the fight;
6367,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6368,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And mostly for the whiteness of his soul,"
6369,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Which seemed so virginal and all unblurred,—"
6370,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"They called him the White Prince, and through the whole"
6371,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,True land the name became a household word.
6372,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“God save the Queen!” the loyal people sung,"
6373,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“And the White Prince!” came back from every tongue.
6374,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6375,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,So passed the stages of a glorious reign.
6376,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The Queen in tranquil goodness reached her noon;
6377,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The Prince wore year by year his double chain;
6378,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His mistress kept her secret like the moon,"
6379,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,That hides one half its splendor and its shade;
6380,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And newer times and men their entrance made.
6381,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6382,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"But did these two, who took their secret fill"
6383,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of stolen waters, find the greater bliss"
6384,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"They sought? At first, to meet and part at will"
6385,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Was, for the peril’s sake, a happiness;"
6386,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Ay, even the sense of guilt made such delights"
6387,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"More worth, as one we call the wisest writes."
6388,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6389,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But with the later years Time brought about
6390,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His famed revenges. Not that love grew cold,"
6391,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The lady never found a cause to doubt
6392,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,That with the Prince his passion kept its hold;
6393,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And while their loved are loyal to them yet,"
6394,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,’Tis not the wont of women to regret.
6395,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6396,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Yet ’twas her lot to live as one whose wealth
6397,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Is in another’s name; to sigh at fate
6398,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That hedged her from possession, save by stealth"
6399,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And trespass on the guileless Queen’s estate;
6400,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To see her lover farthest when most near,"
6401,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Nor dare before the world to make him dear.
6402,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6403,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To see her perfect beauty but a lure,"
6404,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That made men list to follow where she went,"
6405,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And kneel to woo the hand they deemed so pure,"
6406,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And hunger for her pitying mouth’s consent;
6407,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Calling her hard, who was so gently made,"
6408,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Nor found delight in all their homage paid.
6409,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6410,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Nor ever yet was woman’s life complete
6411,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Till at her breast the child of him she loved
6412,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Made life and love one name. Though love be sweet,"
6413,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And passing sweet, till then its growth has proved"
6414,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In woman’s paradise a sterile tree,"
6415,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Fruitless, though fair its leaves and blossoms be."
6416,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6417,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Meanwhile the Prince put on his own disguise,"
6418,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Holding it naught for what it kept secure,"
6419,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Nor wore it only in his comrades’ eyes;
6420,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Beneath this cloak and seeming to be pure
6421,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,He felt the thing he seemed. For some brief space
6422,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,His conscience took the reflex of his face.
6423,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6424,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But lastly through his heart there crept a sense
6425,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of falseness, like a worm about the core,"
6426,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Until he grew to loathe the long pretence
6427,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of blamelessness, and would the mask he wore"
6428,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"By some swift judgment from his face were torn,"
6429,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,So might the outer quell the inner scorn.
6430,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6431,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Such self-contempt befell him, when the feast"
6432,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Rang with his praise, he blushed from nape to crown,"
6433,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And ground his teeth in silence, yet had ceased"
6434,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To bear it, crying, “Crush me not quite down,"
6435,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Who ask your scorn, as viler than you deem"
6436,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Your vilest, and am nothing that I seem!”"
6437,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6438,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,With such a cry his conscience riotous
6439,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Had thrown, perchance, the burden on it laid,"
6440,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But love and pity held his voice; and thus
6441,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The paramours their constant penance made;
6442,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"False to themselves, before the world a lie,"
6443,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Yet each for each had cast the whole world by.
6444,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6445,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In those transcendent moments, when the fire"
6446,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Leapt up between them rapturous and bright,"
6447,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,One incompleteness bred a wild desire
6448,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To let the rest have token of its light;
6449,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So natural seemed their love,—so hapless, too,"
6450,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"They might not make it glorious to view,"
6451,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6452,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And speak their joy. ’Twas all as they had come,"
6453,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"They two, in some far wildwood wandering mazed,"
6454,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Upon a mighty cataract, whose foam"
6455,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And splendor ere that time had never dazed
6456,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Men’s eyes, nor any hearing save their own"
6457,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Could listen to its immemorial moan,"
6458,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6459,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And felt amid their triumph bitter pain
6460,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,That only for themselves was spread that sight.
6461,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Oft, when his comrades sang a tender strain,"
6462,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And music, talk, and wine, outlasted night,"
6463,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Rose in the Prince’s throat this sudden tide,"
6464,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“And I,—I also know where Love doth hide!”"
6465,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6466,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Yet still the seals were ever on his mouth;
6467,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"No heart, save one, his joy and dole might share."
6468,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Passed on the winter’s rain and summer’s drouth;
6469,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Friends more and more, and lovers true, the pair,"
6470,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Though life its passion and its youth had spent,"
6471,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Still kept their faith as seasons came and went.
6472,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6473,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,*       *       *       *       *
6474,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6475,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"One final hour, with stammering voice and halt,"
6476,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Prince said: “Dear, for you,—whose only gain"
6477,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Was in your love that made such long default
6478,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To self,—Heaven deems you sinless! but a pain"
6479,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Is on my soul, and shadow of guilt threefold:"
6480,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"First, in your fair life, fettered by my hold;"
6481,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6482,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Then in the ceaseless wrong I do the Queen,"
6483,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Who worships me, unknowing; worse than all,"
6484,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To wear before the world this painted mien!
6485,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,See to it: on my head some bolt will fall!
6486,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"We have sweet memories of the good years past,"
6487,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Now let this secret league no longer last.”
6488,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6489,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,So of her love and pure unselfishness
6490,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She yielded at his word, yet fain would pray"
6491,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"For one more tryst, one day of tenderness,"
6492,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Where first their lives were mated. Such a day
6493,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Found them entwined together, met to part,"
6494,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Lips pressed to lips, and voiceless grief at heart."
6495,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6496,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And last the Prince drew off his signet-stone,"
6497,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And gave it to his mistress,—as he rose"
6498,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To shut the book of happy moments gone,"
6499,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"For so all earthly pleasures find a close,—"
6500,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Yet promised, at her time of utmost need"
6501,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And summons by that token, to take heed"
6502,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6503,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And do her will. “And from this hour,” he said,"
6504,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“No woman’s kiss save one my lips shall know.”
6505,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So left her pale and trembling there, and fled,"
6506,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Nor looked again, resolved it must be so;"
6507,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"But somewhere gained his horse, and through the wood"
6508,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Moved homeward with his thoughts, a phantom brood"
6509,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6510,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That turned the long past over in his mind,"
6511,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Poising its good and evil, while a haze"
6512,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Gathered around him, of that sombre kind"
6513,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Which follows from a place where many days
6514,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Have seen us go and come; and even if sore
6515,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Has been our sojourn there, we feel the more"
6516,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6517,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That parting is a sorrow,—though we part"
6518,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"With those who loved us not, or go forlorn"
6519,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,From pain that ate its canker in the heart;
6520,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But when we leave the paths where Love has borne
6521,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"His garlands to us, Pleasure poured her wine,"
6522,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Where life was wholly precious and divine,"
6523,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6524,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Then go we forth as exiles. In such wise
6525,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The loath, wan Prince his homeward journey made,"
6526,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Brooding, and marked not with his downcast eyes"
6527,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The shadow that within the coppice shade
6528,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Sank darker still; but at the horse’s gait
6529,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Kept slowly on, and rode to meet his fate."
6530,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6531,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"For from the west a silent gathering drew,"
6532,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And hid the summer sky, and brought swift night"
6533,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Across that shire, and went devouring through"
6534,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The strong old forest, stronger in its might."
6535,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,With the first sudden crash the Prince’s steed
6536,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Took the long stride, and galloped at good need."
6537,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6538,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The wild pace tallied with the rider’s mood,"
6539,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And on he spurred, and even now had reached"
6540,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The storm that charged the borders of the wood,"
6541,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,When one great whirlwind seized an oak which bleached
6542,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Across his path, and felled it; and its fall"
6543,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Bore down the Prince beneath it, horse and all."
6544,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6545,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,There lay he as he fell; but the mad horse
6546,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Plunged out in fright, and reared upon his feet,"
6547,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And for the city struck a headlong course,"
6548,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"With clatter of hoof along the central street,"
6549,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Nor halted till, thus masterless and late,"
6550,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Bleeding and torn, he reached the palace-gate."
6551,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6552,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then rose a clamor and the tidings spread,"
6553,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And servitors and burghers thronged about,"
6554,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Crying, “The Prince’s horse! the Prince is dead!”"
6555,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Till on the courser’s track they sallied out,"
6556,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And came upon the fallen oak, and found"
6557,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The Prince sore maimed and senseless on the ground.
6558,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6559,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then wattling boughs, they raised him in their hold,"
6560,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And after that rough litter, and before,"
6561,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The people went in silence; but there rolled
6562,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A fiery vapor from the lights they bore,"
6563,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Like some red serpent huge along the road.
6564,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Even thus they brought him back to his abode.
6565,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6566,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"There the pale Queen fell on him at the porch,"
6567,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Dabbling her robes in blood, and made ado,"
6568,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And over all his henchman held a torch,"
6569,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Until with reverent steps they took him through;
6570,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And the doors closed, and midnight from the domes"
6571,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Was sounded, and the people sought their homes."
6572,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6573,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"But on the morrow, like a dreadful bird,"
6574,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Flew swift the tidings of this sudden woe,"
6575,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And reached the Prince’s paramour, who heard"
6576,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Aghast, as one who crieth loud, “The blow"
6577,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Is fallen! I am the cause!”—as one who saith,"
6578,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Now let me die, whose hands have given death!”"
6579,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6580,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So gat her to the town remorsefully,"
6581,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,White with a mortal tremor and the sin
6582,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Which sealed her mouth, and waited what might be,"
6583,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And watched the doors she dared not pass within.
6584,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Alas, poor lady! that lone week of fears"
6585,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Outlived the length of all her former years.
6586,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6587,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Some days the Prince, upon the skirts of death,"
6588,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Spake not a word nor heard the Queen’s one prayer,"
6589,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Nor turned his face, nor felt her loving breath,"
6590,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Nor saw his children when they gathered there,"
6591,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But rested dumb and motionless; and so
6592,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Queen grew weak with watching and her woe,"
6593,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6594,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Till from his bed they bore her to her own
6595,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A little. In the middle-tide of night,"
6596,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Thereafter, he awoke with moan on moan,"
6597,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And saw his death anigh, and said outright,"
6598,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“I had all things, but love was worth them all!”"
6599,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then sped they for the Queen, yet ere the call"
6600,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6601,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Reached her, he cried once more, “Too late! too late!”"
6602,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And at those words, before they led her in,"
6603,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Come the sure dart of him that lay in wait.
6604,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The Prince was dead: what goodness and what sin
6605,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Died with him were untold. At sunrise fell
6606,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Across the capital his solemn knell.
6607,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6608,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"All respite it forbade, and joyance thence,"
6609,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,To one for whom his passion till the last
6610,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Wrought in the dying Prince. Her wan suspense
6611,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Thus ended, a great fear upon her passed."
6612,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“I was the cause!” she moaned from day to day,"
6613,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“Now let me bear the penance as I may!”
6614,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6615,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,So with her whole estate she sought and gained
6616,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A refuge in a nunnery close at view,"
6617,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And there for months withdrew her, and remained"
6618,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,In tears and prayers. Anon a sickness grew
6619,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Upon her, and her face the ghost became"
6620,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of what it was, the same and not the same."
6621,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6622,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,So died the blameless Prince. The spacious land
6623,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Was smitten in his death, and such a wail"
6624,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Arose, as when the midnight angel’s hand"
6625,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Was laid on Egypt. Gossips ceased their tale,"
6626,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Or whispered of his goodness, and were mute;"
6627,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,No sound was heard of viol or of lute;
6628,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6629,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The streets were hung with black; the artisan
6630,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Forsook his forge; the artist dropped his brush;
6631,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The tradesmen closed their windows. Man with man
6632,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Struck hands together in the first deep hush
6633,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of grief; or, where the dead Prince lay in state,"
6634,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Spoke of his life, so blameless, pure, and great."
6635,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6636,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"But when, within the dark cathedral vault,"
6637,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"They joined his ashes to the dust of kings,"
6638,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,No royal pomp was shown; for Death made halt
6639,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Above the palace yet, on dusky wings,"
6640,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Waiting to gain the Queen, who still was prone"
6641,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Along the couch where haply she had thrown,"
6642,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6643,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"At knowledge of the end, her stricken frame."
6644,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,With visage pale as in a mortal swound
6645,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She stayed, nor slept, nor wept, till, weeping, came"
6646,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The crown-prince and besought her to look round
6647,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And speak unto her children. Then she said:
6648,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“Hereto no grief has fallen on our head;
6649,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6650,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“Now all our earthly portion in one mass
6651,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Is loosed against us with this single stroke!
6652,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Yet we are Queen, and still must live,—alas!—"
6653,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,As he would have us.” Even as she spoke
6654,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She wept, and mended thence, yet bore the face"
6655,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Of one whose fate delays but for a space.
6656,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6657,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Thenceforth she worked and waited till the call
6658,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Of Heaven should close the labor and the pause.
6659,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Months, seasons passed, yet evermore a pall"
6660,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Hung round the court. The sorrow and the cause
6661,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Were always with her; after things were tame
6662,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Beside the shadow of his deeds and fame.
6663,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6664,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Her palaces and parks seemed desolate;
6665,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,No joy was left in sky or street or field;
6666,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"No age, she thought, would see the Prince’s mate:"
6667,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,What matchless hand his knightly sword could wield?
6668,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The world had lost, this royal widow said,"
6669,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Its one bright jewel when the Prince was dead.
6670,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6671,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,So that his fame might be enduring there
6672,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"For many a reign, and sacred through the land,"
6673,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She gathered bronze and lazuli, and rare"
6674,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Swart marbles, while her cunning artists planned"
6675,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A stately cenotaph,—and bade them place"
6676,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Above its front the Prince’s form and face,"
6677,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6678,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Sculptured, as if in life. But the pale Queen,"
6679,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Watching the work herself, would somewhat lure"
6680,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her heart from plaining; till, behind a screen,"
6681,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The tomb was finished, glorious and pure,"
6682,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Even like the Prince: and they proclaimed a day
6683,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,When the Queen’s hand should draw its veil away.
6684,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6685,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"It chanced, the noon before, she bade them fetch"
6686,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her equipage, and with her children rode"
6687,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Beyond the city walls, across a stretch"
6688,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of the green open country, where abode"
6689,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her subjects, happy in the field and grange,"
6690,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And with their griefs, that took a meaner range,"
6691,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6692,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Content. But as her joyless vision dwelt
6693,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"On beauty that so failed her wound to heal,"
6694,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She marked the Abbey’s ancient pile, and felt"
6695,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A longing at its chapel-shrine to kneel,"
6696,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To pray, and think awhile on Heaven,—her one"
6697,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Sole passion, now the Prince had thither gone."
6698,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6699,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She reached the gate, and through the vestibule"
6700,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The nuns, with reverence for the royal sorrow,"
6701,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Led to the shrine, and left her there to school"
6702,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Her heart for that sad pageant of the morrow.
6703,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"O, what deep sighs, what piteous tearful prayers,"
6704,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,What golden grief-blanched hair strewn unawares!
6705,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6706,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Anon her coming through the place was sped,"
6707,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And when from that lone ecstasy she rose
6708,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The saintly Abbess held her steps, and said:"
6709,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“God rests those, daughter, who in others’ woes"
6710,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Forget their own! In yonder corridor
6711,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A sister-sufferer lies, and will no more"
6712,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6713,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Pass through her door to catch the morning’s breath,—"
6714,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A worldling once, the chamberlain’s young wife,"
6715,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"But now a pious novice, meet for death;"
6716,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,She prays to see your face once more in life.”
6717,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“She, too, is widowed,” thought the Queen. Aloud"
6718,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She answered, “I will visit her,” and bowed"
6719,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6720,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her head, and, following, reached the room where lay"
6721,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,One that had wronged her so; and shrank to see
6722,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That beauteous pallid face, so pined away,"
6723,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And the starved lips that murmured painfully,"
6724,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“I have a secret none but she may hear.”
6725,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"At the Queen’s sign, they two were left anear."
6726,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6727,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"With that the dying rushed upon her speech,"
6728,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"As one condemned, who gulps the poisoned wine"
6729,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Nor pauses, lest to see it stand at reach"
6730,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Were crueller still. “Madam, I sought a sign,”"
6731,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She cried, “to know if God would have me make"
6732,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Confession, and to you! now let me take"
6733,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6734,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“This meeting as the sign, and speak, and die!”"
6735,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Child,” said the Queen, “your years are yet too few."
6736,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"See how I live,—and yet what sorrows lie"
6737,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"About my heart.”—“I know,—the world spake true!"
6738,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"You too have loved him; ay, he seems to stand"
6739,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Between us! Queen, you had the Prince’s hand,"
6740,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6741,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“But not his love!” Across the good Queen’s brow
6742,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"A flame of anger reddened, as when one"
6743,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Meets unprepared a swift and ruthless blow,"
6744,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"But instant paled to pity, as she thought,"
6745,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“She wanders: ’tis the fever at her brain!”
6746,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,And looked her thought. The other cried again:
6747,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6748,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Yes! I am ill of body and soul indeed,"
6749,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Yet this was as I say. O, not for me"
6750,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Pity, from you who wear the widow’s weed,"
6751,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Unknowing!”—“Woman, whose could that love be,"
6752,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"If not all mine?” The other, with a moan,"
6753,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Rose in her bed; the pillow, backward thrown,"
6754,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6755,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Was darkened with the torrent of her hair.
6756,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“’Twas hers,” she wailed,—“’twas hers who loved him best.”"
6757,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Then tore apart her night-robe, and laid bare"
6758,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her flesh, and lo! against her poor white breast"
6759,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Close round her gloomed a shift of blackest serge,"
6760,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Fearful, concealed!—“I might not sing his dirge,”"
6761,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6762,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She said, “nor moan aloud and bring him shame,"
6763,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Nor haunt his tomb and cling about the grate,"
6764,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But this I fashioned when the tidings came
6765,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"That he was dead and I must expiate,"
6766,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Being left, our double sin!”—In the Queen’s heart,"
6767,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The tiger—that is prisoned at life’s start
6768,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6769,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"In mortals, though perchance it never wakes"
6770,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,From its mute sleep—began to rouse and crawl.
6771,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her lips grew white, and on her nostrils flakes"
6772,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of wrath and loathing stood. “What, now, is all"
6773,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,This wicked drivel?” she cried; “how dare they bring
6774,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,The Queen to listen to so foul a thing?”
6775,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6776,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Queen! I speak truth,—the truth, I say! He fed"
6777,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Upon these lips,—this hair he loved to praise!"
6778,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,I held within these arms his bright fair head
6779,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Pressed close, ah, close!—Our lifetimes were the days"
6780,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"We met,—the rest a void!”—“Thou spectral Sin,"
6781,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Be silent! or, if such a thing hath been,—"
6782,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6783,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“If this be not thy frenzy,—quick, the proof,"
6784,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Before I score the lie thy lips amid!”
6785,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She spoke so dread the other crouched aloof,"
6786,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Panting, but with gaunt hands somewhere undid"

6790,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Fell on it, and that moment the strong stay,"
6791,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Which held her from the instinct of her wrong,"

6794,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"As if a tower should fall, and on the plain"
6795,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Only a scathed and broken pile remain.
6796,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6797,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,But in its stead she would not measure yet
6798,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The counter-chance, nor deem this sole attaint"
6799,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Made the Prince less than one in whom ’twas set
6800,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"To prove him man. “I held him as a saint,”"

6802,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,My blameless one! Too high my faith had flown:
6803,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6804,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“So be it!” With a sudden bitter scorn
6805,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"She said: “You were his plaything, then! the food"
6806,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Wherewith he dulled what appetite is born,"
6807,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of the gross kind, in men. His nobler mood"
6808,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"You knew not! How, shall I,—the fountain life"
6809,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Of yonder children,—his embosomed wife"
6810,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6811,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“Through all these years,—shall I, his Queen, for this"
6812,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Sin-smitten harlot’s gage of an hour’s shame,"
6813,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Misdoubt him?”—“Yes, I was his harlot,—yes,"
6814,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,God help me! and had worn the loathly name

6816,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“Thou strumpet! wilt thou have me of his prize

6828,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,Writ in the hand that hapless sovereign knew

6839,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"The Queen strode forward with an awful stride,"
6840,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And seized the dying one, and bore her down,"
6841,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And rose her height, and said, “Thou shouldst have died"

6856,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"And, even as her chariot moved away,"
6857,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,High o’er the Abbey heard the minster toll
6858,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Its doleful bell, as for a passing soul."
6859,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6860,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Though midst her guardsmen, as they speeded back,"

6870,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Like asps, to sting her; from the kingdom’s heir,"
6871,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Shuddering, she turned her face,—his features took"
6872,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,A shining horror from his father’s look.
6873,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6874,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Along her city streets the thrifty crowd,"
6875,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"As the Queen passed, their loving reverence made."
6876,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,“’Tis false! they love me not!” she cried aloud;
6877,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"So flung her from her chariot, and forbade"
6878,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"All words, but waved her ladies back, and gained"
6879,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"Her inmost room, and by herself remained."
6880,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,
6881,THE BLAMELESS PRINCE.,"“We have been alone these years, and knew it not,”"

9117,GETTYSBURG.,"Men who have driven so oft the foe, so oft have striven in vain,"

9121,GETTYSBURG.,"It was the memory of the past that bore us through the fray,"

9134,GETTYSBURG.,
9135,GETTYSBURG.,"At night, before the closing fray, when all the front was still,"
9136,GETTYSBURG.,We lay in bivouac along the cannon-crested hill.
9137,GETTYSBURG.,Ours was the dauntless Second Corps; and many a soldier knew
9138,GETTYSBURG.,"How sped the fight, and sternly thought of what was yet to do."
9139,GETTYSBURG.,"Guarding the centre there, we lay, and talked with bated breath"
9140,GETTYSBURG.,"Of Buford’s stand beyond the town, of gallant Reynold’s death,"
9141,GETTYSBURG.,"Of cruel retreats through pent-up streets by murderous volleys swept,—"

9144,GETTYSBURG.,"And we swore to conquer in the end, or even like them to fall."
9145,GETTYSBURG.,
9146,GETTYSBURG.,"And passed from mouth to mouth the tale of that grim day just done,"
9147,GETTYSBURG.,"The fight by Round Top’s craggy spur,—of all the deadliest one;"
9148,GETTYSBURG.,"It saved the left: but on the right they pressed us back too well,"
9149,GETTYSBURG.,And like a field in Spring the ground was ploughed with shot and shell.
9150,GETTYSBURG.,"There was the ancient graveyard, its hummocks crushed and red,"
9151,GETTYSBURG.,"And there, between them, side by side, the wounded and the dead:"

9153,GETTYSBURG.,"Laid in their graves, to slumber here, a score of years ago;"
9154,GETTYSBURG.,"It seemed their waking, wandering shades were asking of our slain,"
9155,GETTYSBURG.,What brought such hideous tumult now where they so still had lain!
9156,GETTYSBURG.,
9157,GETTYSBURG.,"Bright rose the sun of Gettysburg that morrow morning-tide,"
9158,GETTYSBURG.,And call of trump and roll of drum from height to height replied.
9159,GETTYSBURG.,Hark! from the east already goes up the rattling din;
9160,GETTYSBURG.,"The Twelfth Corps, winning back their ground, right well the day begin!"
9161,GETTYSBURG.,"They whirl fierce Ewell from their front! Now we of the Second pray,"
9162,GETTYSBURG.,"As right and left the brunt have borne, the centre might to-day."
9163,GETTYSBURG.,"But all was still from hill to hill for many a breathless hour,"
9164,GETTYSBURG.,While for the coming battle-shock Lee gathered in his power;
9165,GETTYSBURG.,"And back and forth our leaders rode, who knew not rest or fear,"
9166,GETTYSBURG.,"And along the lines, where’er they came, went up the ringing cheer."
9167,GETTYSBURG.,
9168,GETTYSBURG.,’Twas past the hour of nooning; the Summer skies were blue;
9169,GETTYSBURG.,Behind the covering timber the foe was hid from view;
9170,GETTYSBURG.,"So fair and sweet with waving wheat the pleasant valley lay,"
9171,GETTYSBURG.,It brought to mind our Northern homes and meadows far away;
9172,GETTYSBURG.,When the whole western ridge at once was fringed with fire and smoke;
9173,GETTYSBURG.,Against our lines from sevenscore guns the dreadful tempest broke!
9174,GETTYSBURG.,"Then loud our batteries answer, and far along the crest,"
9175,GETTYSBURG.,And to and fro the roaring bolts are driven east and west;
9176,GETTYSBURG.,"Heavy and dark around us glooms the stifling sulphur-cloud,"
9177,GETTYSBURG.,And the cries of mangled men and horse go up beneath its shroud.
9178,GETTYSBURG.,
9179,GETTYSBURG.,The guns are still: the end is nigh: we grasp our arms anew;
9180,GETTYSBURG.,O now let every heart be stanch and every aim be true!
9181,GETTYSBURG.,"For look! from yonder wood that skirts the valley’s further marge,"
9182,GETTYSBURG.,The flower of all the Southern host move to the final charge.
9183,GETTYSBURG.,By Heaven! it is a fearful sight to see their double rank
9184,GETTYSBURG.,"Come with a hundred battle-flags,—a mile from flank to flank!"
9185,GETTYSBURG.,"Tramping the grain to earth, they come, ten thousand men abreast;"
9186,GETTYSBURG.,"Their standards wave,—their hearts are brave,—they hasten not, nor rest,"
9187,GETTYSBURG.,"But close the gaps our cannon make, and onward press, and nigher,"
9188,GETTYSBURG.,"And, yelling at our very front, again pour in their fire!"
9189,GETTYSBURG.,
9190,GETTYSBURG.,"Now burst our sheeted lightnings forth, now all our wrath has vent!"
9191,GETTYSBURG.,"They die, they wither; through and through their wavering lines are rent."
9192,GETTYSBURG.,"But these are gallant, desperate men, of our own race and land,"
9193,GETTYSBURG.,"Who charge anew, and welcome death, and fight us hand to hand:"
9194,GETTYSBURG.,"Vain, vain! give way, as well ye may—the crimson die is cast!"
9195,GETTYSBURG.,"Their bravest leaders bite the dust, their strength is failing fast;"
9196,GETTYSBURG.,"They yield, they turn, they fly the field: we smite them as they run;"
9197,GETTYSBURG.,"Their arms, their colors are our spoil; the furious fight is done!"
9198,GETTYSBURG.,Across the plain we follow far and backward push the fray:
9199,GETTYSBURG.,Cheer! cheer! the grand old Army at last has won the day!
9200,GETTYSBURG.,
9201,GETTYSBURG.,Hurrah! the day has won the cause! No gray-clad host henceforth
9202,GETTYSBURG.,Shall come with fire and sword to tread the highways of the North!
9203,GETTYSBURG.,"’Twas such a flood as when ye see, along the Atlantic shore,"
9204,GETTYSBURG.,The great Spring-tide roll grandly in with swelling surge and roar:
9205,GETTYSBURG.,It seems no wall can stay its leap or balk its wild desire
9206,GETTYSBURG.,"Beyond the bound that Heaven hath fixed to higher mount, and higher;"
9207,GETTYSBURG.,"But now, when whitest lifts its crest, most loud its billows call,"
9208,GETTYSBURG.,"Touched by the Power that led them on, they fall, and fall, and fall."
9209,GETTYSBURG.,"Even thus, unstayed upon his course, to Gettysburg the foe"
9210,GETTYSBURG.,"His legions led, and fought, and fled, and might no further go."
9211,GETTYSBURG.,
9212,GETTYSBURG.,Full many a dark-eyed Southern girl shall weep her lover dead;
9213,GETTYSBURG.,"But with a price the fight was ours,—we too have tears to shed!"
9214,GETTYSBURG.,"The bells that peal our triumph forth anon shall toll the brave,"
9215,GETTYSBURG.,"Above whose heads the cross must stand, the hillside grasses wave!"
