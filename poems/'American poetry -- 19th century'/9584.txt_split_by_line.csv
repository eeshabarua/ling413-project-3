39,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
40,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,It can scarcely be necessary to name as the two companions whom I
41,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"reckoned with myself in this poetical picnic, Fields the lettered"
42,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"magnate, and Taylor the free cosmopolite. The long line of sandy"
43,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,beach which defines almost the whole of the New Hampshire sea-coast
44,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"is especially marked near its southern extremity, by the"
45,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,salt-meadows of Hampton. The Hampton River winds through these
46,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"meadows, and the reader may, if he choose, imagine my tent pitched"
47,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"near its mouth, where also was the scene of the _Wreck of"
48,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Rivermouth_. The green bluff to the northward is Great Boar's Head;
49,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"southward is the Merrimac, with Newburyport lifting its steeples"
50,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,above brown roofs and green trees on banks.
51,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
52,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"I would not sin, in this half-playful strain,--"
53,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Too light perhaps for serious years, though born"
54,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Of the enforced leisure of slow pain,--"
55,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Against the pure ideal which has drawn
56,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,My feet to follow its far-shining gleam.
57,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,A simple plot is mine: legends and runes
58,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Of credulous days, old fancies that have lain"
59,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Silent, from boyhood taking voice again,"
60,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Warmed into life once more, even as the tunes"
61,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"That, frozen in the fabled hunting-horn,"
62,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Thawed into sound:--a winter fireside dream
63,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Of dawns and-sunsets by the summer sea,"
64,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Whose sands are traversed by a silent throng
65,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Of voyagers from that vaster mystery
66,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Of which it is an emblem;--and the dear
67,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Memory of one who might have tuned my song
68,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,To sweeter music by her delicate ear.
69,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
70,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
71,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,When heats as of a tropic clime
72,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Burned all our inland valleys through,"
73,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Three friends, the guests of summer time,"
74,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Pitched their white tent where sea-winds blew.
75,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Behind them, marshes, seamed and crossed"
76,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"With narrow creeks, and flower-embossed,"
77,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Stretched to the dark oak wood, whose leafy arms"
78,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Screened from the stormy East the pleasant inland farms.
79,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
80,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,At full of tide their bolder shore
81,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Of sun-bleached sand the waters beat;
82,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"At ebb, a smooth and glistening floor"
83,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"They touched with light, receding feet."
84,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Northward a 'green bluff broke the chain
85,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Of sand-hills; southward stretched a plain
86,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Of salt grass, with a river winding down,"
87,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Sail-whitened, and beyond the steeples of the town,"
88,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
89,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Whence sometimes, when the wind was light"
90,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And dull the thunder of the beach,"
91,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,They heard the bells of morn and night
92,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Swing, miles away, their silver speech."
93,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Above low scarp and turf-grown wall
94,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,They saw the fort-flag rise and fall;
95,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And, the first star to signal twilight's hour,"
96,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,The lamp-fire glimmer down from the tall light-house tower.
97,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
98,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"They rested there, escaped awhile"
99,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"From cares that wear the life away,"
100,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,To eat the lotus of the Nile
101,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And drink the poppies of Cathay,--"
102,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"To fling their loads of custom down,"
103,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Like drift-weed, on the sand-slopes brown,"
104,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And in the sea waves drown the restless pack
105,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Of duties, claims, and needs that barked upon their track."
106,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
107,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"One, with his beard scarce silvered, bore"
108,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A ready credence in his looks,"
109,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A lettered magnate, lording o'er"
110,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,An ever-widening realm of books.
111,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"In him brain-currents, near and far,"
112,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Converged as in a Leyden jar;
113,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The old, dead authors thronged him round about,"
114,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And Elzevir's gray ghosts from leathern graves looked out.
115,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
116,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"He knew each living pundit well,"
117,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Could weigh the gifts of him or her,"
118,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And well the market value tell
119,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Of poet and philosopher.
120,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"But if he lost, the scenes behind,"
121,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Somewhat of reverence vague and blind,"
122,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Finding the actors human at the best,"
123,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,No readier lips than his the good he saw confessed.
124,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
125,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"His boyhood fancies not outgrown,"
126,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He loved himself the singer's art;
127,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Tenderly, gently, by his own"
128,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He knew and judged an author's heart.
129,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,No Rhadamanthine brow of doom
130,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Bowed the dazed pedant from his room;
131,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And bards, whose name is legion, if denied,"
132,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Bore off alike intact their verses and their pride.
133,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
134,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Pleasant it was to roam about
135,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The lettered world as he had, done,"
136,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And see the lords of song without
137,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Their singing robes and garlands on.
138,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"With Wordsworth paddle Rydal mere,"
139,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Taste rugged Elliott's home-brewed beer,"
140,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And with the ears of Rogers, at fourscore,"
141,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Hear Garrick's buskined tread and Walpole's wit once more.
142,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
143,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And one there was, a dreamer born,"
144,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Who, with a mission to fulfil,"
145,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Had left the Muses' haunts to turn
146,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The crank of an opinion-mill,"
147,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Making his rustic reed of song
148,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A weapon in the war with wrong,"
149,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Yoking his fancy to the breaking-plough
150,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,That beam-deep turned the soil for truth to spring and grow.
151,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
152,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Too quiet seemed the man to ride
153,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,The winged Hippogriff Reform;
154,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Was his a voice from side to side
155,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,To pierce the tumult of the storm?
156,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A silent, shy, peace-loving man,"
157,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He seemed no fiery partisan
158,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"To hold his way against the public frown,"
159,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The ban of Church and State, the fierce mob's hounding down."
160,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
161,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,For while he wrought with strenuous will
162,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The work his hands had found to do,"
163,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He heard the fitful music still
164,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Of winds that out of dream-land blew.
165,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,The din about him could not drown
166,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,What the strange voices whispered down;
167,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Along his task-field weird processions swept,"
168,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,The visionary pomp of stately phantoms stepped:
169,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
170,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The common air was thick with dreams,--"
171,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He told them to the toiling crowd;
172,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Such music as the woods and streams
173,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Sang in his ear he sang aloud;
174,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"In still, shut bays, on windy capes,"
175,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"He heard the call of beckoning shapes,"
176,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And, as the gray old shadows prompted him,"
177,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,To homely moulds of rhyme he shaped their legends grim.
178,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
179,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"He rested now his weary hands,"
180,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And lightly moralized and laughed,"
181,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"As, tracing on the shifting sands"
182,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A burlesque of his paper-craft,"
183,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,He saw the careless waves o'errun
184,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"His words, as time before had done,"
185,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Each day's tide-water washing clean away,"
186,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Like letters from the sand, the work of yesterday."
187,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
188,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And one, whose Arab face was tanned"
189,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"By tropic sun and boreal frost,"
190,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,So travelled there was scarce a land
191,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Or people left him to exhaust,"
192,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,In idling mood had from him hurled
193,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The poor squeezed orange of the world,"
194,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And in the tent-shade, as beneath a palm,"
195,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Smoked, cross-legged like a Turk, in Oriental calm."
196,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
197,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,The very waves that washed the sand
198,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Below him, he had seen before"
199,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Whitening the Scandinavian strand
200,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And sultry Mauritanian shore.
201,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"From ice-rimmed isles, from summer seas"
202,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Palm-fringed, they bore him messages;"
203,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"He heard the plaintive Nubian songs again,"
204,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And mule-bells tinkling down the mountain-paths of Spain.
205,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
206,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,His memory round the ransacked earth
207,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,On Puck's long girdle slid at ease;
208,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And, instant, to the valley's girth"
209,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Of mountains, spice isles of the seas,"
210,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Faith flowered in minster stones, Art's guess"
211,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"At truth and beauty, found access;"
212,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Yet loved the while, that free cosmopolite,"
213,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Old friends, old ways, and kept his boyhood's dreams in sight."
214,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
215,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Untouched as yet by wealth and pride,"
216,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,That virgin innocence of beach
217,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"No shingly monster, hundred-eyed,"
218,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Stared its gray sand-birds out of reach;
219,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Unhoused, save where, at intervals,"
220,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The white tents showed their canvas walls,"
221,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Where brief sojourners, in the cool, soft air,"
222,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Forgot their inland heats, hard toil, and year-long care."
223,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
224,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Sometimes along the wheel-deep sand
225,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A one-horse wagon slowly crawled,"
226,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Deep laden with a youthful band,"
227,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Whose look some homestead old recalled;
228,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Brother perchance, and sisters twain,"
229,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And one whose blue eyes told, more plain"
230,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Than the free language of her rosy lip,"
231,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Of the still dearer claim of love's relationship.
232,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
233,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"With cheeks of russet-orchard tint,"
234,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The light laugh of their native rills,"
235,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The perfume of their garden's mint,"
236,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The breezy freedom of the hills,"
237,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"They bore, in unrestrained delight,"
238,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The motto of the Garter's knight,"
239,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Careless as if from every gazing thing
240,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Hid by their innocence, as Gyges by his ring."
241,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
242,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The clanging sea-fowl came and went,"
243,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,The hunter's gun in the marshes rang;
244,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,At nightfall from a neighboring tent
245,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,A flute-voiced woman sweetly sang.
246,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Loose-haired, barefooted, hand-in-hand,"
247,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Young girls went tripping down the sand;
248,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And youths and maidens, sitting in the moon,"
249,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Dreamed o'er the old fond dream from which we wake too soon.
250,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
251,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"At times their fishing-lines they plied,"
252,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"With an old Triton at the oar,"
253,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Salt as the sea-wind, tough and dried"
254,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,As a lean cusk from Labrador.
255,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Strange tales he told of wreck and storm,--"
256,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Had seen the sea-snake's awful form,"
257,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And heard the ghosts on Haley's Isle complain,"
258,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Speak him off shore, and beg a passage to old Spain!"
259,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
260,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And there, on breezy morns, they saw"
261,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The fishing-schooners outward run,"
262,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Their low-bent sails in tack and flaw
263,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Turned white or dark to shade and sun.
264,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Sometimes, in calms of closing day,"
265,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"They watched the spectral mirage play,"
266,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Saw low, far islands looming tall and nigh,"
267,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And ships, with upturned keels, sail like a sea the sky."
268,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
269,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Sometimes a cloud, with thunder black,"
270,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Stooped low upon the darkening main,"
271,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Piercing the waves along its track
272,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,With the slant javelins of rain.
273,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And when west-wind and sunshine warm
274,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Chased out to sea its wrecks of storm,"
275,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,They saw the prismy hues in thin spray showers
276,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Where the green buds of waves burst into white froth flowers.
277,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
278,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,And when along the line of shore
279,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The mists crept upward chill and damp,"
280,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Stretched, careless, on their sandy floor"
281,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Beneath the flaring lantern lamp,"
282,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"They talked of all things old and new,"
283,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Read, slept, and dreamed as idlers do;"
284,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And in the unquestioned freedom of the tent,"
285,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Body and o'er-taxed mind to healthful ease unbent.
286,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
287,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Once, when the sunset splendors died,"
288,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And, trampling up the sloping sand,"
289,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"In lines outreaching far and wide,"
290,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The white-waned billows swept to land,"
291,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Dim seen across the gathering shade,"
292,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"A vast and ghostly cavalcade,"
293,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"They sat around their lighted kerosene,"
294,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Hearing the deep bass roar their every pause between.
295,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,
296,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Then, urged thereto, the Editor"
297,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"Within his full portfolio dipped,"
298,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,Feigning excuse while seaching for
299,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,(With secret pride) his manuscript.
300,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"His pale face flushed from eye to beard,"
301,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"With nervous cough his throat he cleared,"
302,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"And, in a voice so tremulous it betrayed"
303,THE TENT ON THE BEACH,"The anxious fondness of an author's heart, he read:"

310,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Eunice Cole, who for a quarter of a century or more was feared,"
311,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"persecuted, and hated as the witch of Hampton. She lived alone in a"
312,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,hovel a little distant from the spot where the Hampton Academy now
313,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"stands, and there she died, unattended. When her death was"
314,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"discovered, she was hastily covered up in the earth near by, and a"

316,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Stephen Bachiler or Batchelder was one of the ablest of the early
317,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,New England preachers. His marriage late in life to a woman
318,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,regarded by his church as disreputable induced him to return to
319,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"England, where he enjoyed the esteem and favor of Oliver Cromwell"
320,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,during the Protectorate.
321,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
322,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Rivermouth Rocks are fair to see,"
323,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"By dawn or sunset shone across,"
324,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"When the ebb of the sea has left them free,"
325,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,To dry their fringes of gold-green moss
326,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"For there the river comes winding down,"
327,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"From salt sea-meadows and uplands brown,"
328,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And waves on the outer rocks afoam
329,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Shout to its waters, ""Welcome home!"""
330,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
331,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And fair are the sunny isles in view
332,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"East of the grisly Head of the Boar,"
333,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And Agamenticus lifts its blue
334,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Disk of a cloud the woodlands o'er;
335,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"And southerly, when the tide is down,"
336,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"'Twixt white sea-waves and sand-hills brown,"
337,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The beach-birds dance and the gray gulls wheel
338,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Over a floor of burnished steel.

340,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Once, in the old Colonial days,"
341,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Two hundred years ago and more,"
342,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,A boat sailed down through the winding ways
343,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Of Hampton River to that low shore,"
344,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Full of a goodly company
345,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Sailing out on the summer sea,"
346,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Veering to catch the land-breeze light,"
347,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,With the Boar to left and the Rocks to right.
348,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
349,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"In Hampton meadows, where mowers laid"
350,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Their scythes to the swaths of salted grass,"
351,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""Ah, well-a-day! our hay must be made!"""
352,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"A young man sighed, who saw them pass."
353,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Loud laughed his fellows to see him stand
354,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Whetting his scythe with a listless hand,"
355,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Hearing a voice in a far-off song,"
356,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Watching a white hand beckoning long.
357,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
358,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""Fie on the witch!"" cried a merry girl,"
359,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,As they rounded the point where Goody Cole
360,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Sat by her door with her wheel atwirl,"
361,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,A bent and blear-eyed poor old soul.
362,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""Oho!"" she muttered, ""ye 're brave to-day!"
363,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"But I hear the little waves laugh and say,"
364,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,'The broth will be cold that waits at home;
365,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"For it 's one to go, but another to come!'"""

368,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,I'm scary always to see her shake
369,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Her wicked head, with its wild gray hair,"
370,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"And nose like a hawk, and eyes like a snake."""
371,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"But merrily still, with laugh and shout,"
372,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"From Hampton River the boat sailed out,"
373,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Till the huts and the flakes on Star seemed nigh,"
374,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And they lost the scent of the pines of Rye.
375,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
376,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"They dropped their lines in the lazy tide,"
377,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Drawing up haddock and mottled cod;
378,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"They saw not the Shadow that walked beside,"
379,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,They heard not the feet with silence shod.
380,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"But thicker and thicker a hot mist grew,"
381,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Shot by the lightnings through and through;
382,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"And muffled growls, like the growl of a beast,"
383,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Ran along the sky from west to east.
384,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
385,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Then the skipper looked from the darkening sea
386,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Up to the dimmed and wading sun;
387,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"But he spake like a brave man cheerily,"
388,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""Yet there is time for our homeward run."""

398,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The Shoalsmen looked, but saw alone"
399,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Dark films of rain-cloud slantwise blown,"
400,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Wild rocks lit up by the lightning's glare,"
401,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The strife and torment of sea and air.

408,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The tear on her cheek was not of rain

414,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The Shoals stood clear in the light, and all"
415,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The trend of the coast lay hard and black.
416,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"But far and wide as eye could reach,"
417,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,No life was seen upon wave or beach;
418,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The boat that went out at morning never
419,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Sailed back again into Hampton River.
420,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
421,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"O mower, lean on thy bended snath,"

423,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The wind of the sea is a waft of death,"
424,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The waves are singing a song of woe!
425,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"By silent river, by moaning sea,"
426,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Long and vain shall thy watching be
427,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Never again shall the sweet voice call,"
428,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Never the white hand rise and fall!
429,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
430,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"O Rivermouth Rocks, how sad a sight"
431,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Ye saw in the light of breaking day
432,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Dead faces looking up cold and white
433,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,From sand and seaweed where they lay.
434,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The mad old witch-wife wailed and wept,"
435,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And cursed the tide as it backward crept

438,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
439,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Solemn it was in that old day
440,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"In Hampton town and its log-built church,"
441,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Where side by side the coffins lay
442,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And the mourners stood in aisle and porch.
443,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"In the singing-seats young eyes were dim,"
444,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The voices faltered that raised the hymn,"
445,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"And Father Dalton, grave and stern,"
446,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Sobbed through his prayer and wept in turn.
447,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
448,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,But his ancient colleague did not pray;
449,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Under the weight of his fourscore years
450,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,He stood apart with the iron-gray
451,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Of his strong brows knitted to hide his tears;
452,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"And a fair-faced woman of doubtful fame,"
453,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Linking her own with his honored name,"
454,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Subtle as sin, at his side withstood"
455,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The felt reproach of her neighborhood.
456,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
457,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Apart with them, like them forbid,"
458,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Old Goody Cole looked drearily round,"
459,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"As, two by two, with their faces hid,"
460,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The mourners walked to the burying-ground.
461,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,She let the staff from her clasped hands fall
462,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""Lord, forgive us! we're sinners all!"""
463,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And the voice of the old man answered her
464,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"""Amen!"" said Father Bachiler."

468,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And the broken lines of Hampton shore
469,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"In purple mist of cloudland lay,"
470,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The Rivermouth Rocks their story told;
471,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"And waves aglow with sunset gold,"
472,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"Rising and breaking in steady chime,"
473,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,Beat the rhythm and kept the time.
474,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,
475,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"And the sunset paled, and warmed once more"
476,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"With a softer, tenderer after-glow;"
477,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"In the east was moon-rise, with boats off-shore"
478,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And sails in the distance drifting slow.
479,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,"The beacon glimmered from Portsmouth bar,"
480,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,The White Isle kindled its great red star;
481,THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH,And life and death in my old-time lay
