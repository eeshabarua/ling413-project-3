150,I,_Sunset. A high rocky pasture above Alexandria. In the year of Our
151,I,Lord 304._
152,I,
153,I,"Didymus, _a young soldier, enters and throws himself down_."
154,I,
155,I,----------------------------------------------------------------------
156,I,
157,I,_Didymus._
158,I,
159,I,"THIS mound is sweet to me. All my blood aches,"
160,I,"Since driven onward like a dark hill-cloud,"
161,I,"Dizzy with secret lightnings nowhere spent,"
162,I,"I chase yon happy sun to his bright death,"
163,I,"Alas, I know not whither: but I know"
164,I,I shall not see the myriad shields uphung
165,I,"In camp to-night, nor on our cypresses"
166,I,Smoke rise and sink in loath blue fountain spray.
167,I,"So far, so far I drift from even them"
168,I,"Who fill one gourd with me, who cheer my heart,"
169,I,"Who come in, warm and singing, to the tent,"
170,I,"And miss me who am gone away, I think,"
171,I,"Forever, though a day; out of their world,"
172,I,Though over a few leagues of upland grass!
173,I,"Why hast Thou laid on me magic of pain,"
174,I,"God unrevealèd? Was I drawn from sleep,"
175,I,"Man’s duty, body’s health, to be mere wind,"
176,I,Wind undirected over fallow wastes?
177,I,"What wouldst Thou ask of me, no sword of Thine,"
178,I,No ark of service? Yet aware of Thee
179,I,"I am and shall be. All my thought, outspread,"
180,I,Is open unto Thee: a lonely beach
181,I,"Where the wide sobbing surf ebbs everywhere,"
182,I,"And, hard upon each dawn-encolored wave,"
183,I,Flutters the wavy line of drying sand
184,I,"Back to the verge: the white line, shadow-quick,"
185,I,"Thrilling there in the dark: an earthen gleam,"
186,I,Vain huntress of the sea. Suffer me now
187,I,"To follow and attain Thee, fugitive,"
188,I,"And be my rest, who hast, my whole life long,"
189,I,"Been mine unrest: implored, immortal Love!"
190,I,
191,I,----------------------------------------------------------------------
192,I,
193,I,"_A_ Child _enters, with a reed, wearing a wreath of thorns in his"
194,I,hair_.
195,I,
196,I,----------------------------------------------------------------------
197,I,
198,I,"_The Child._ Soldier, pipe up for me, a herd-boy, glad"
199,I,Because his flocks are folded.
200,I,
201,I,"_Didymus._                     Ah, not I!"
202,I,My star is withered; I am man no more.
203,I,"Sigh after sigh the builder Grief takes up,"
204,I,To heighten over me her gradual arch.
205,I,
206,I,"_The Child._ An arch of entrance to a generous garden,"
207,I,Where spirits and the moonlit waters are.
208,I,Take comfort!
209,I,
210,I,"_Didymus._    Thou art a strange child, methinks,"
211,I,To say that too wise word.
212,I,
213,I,"_The Child._               Remember, then,"
214,I,"’Twas breathed to thee at Alexandria,"
215,I,In early-dying April’s golden air.
216,I,
217,I,"_Didymus._ Do I lie here, who deemed myself afar?"
218,I,"I had forgot; I am foolish, lost, bewildered."
219,I,
220,I,_The Child._ O mine elect: be patient!... Listen now.
221,I,There is an evening anthem in my reed;
222,I,"And while the laurels sparkle, and sun-lit,"
223,I,"The mother-swallow dips into her cave,"
224,I,"And doves move close along their bridal bough,"
225,I,"Murmuring sorrow, I will play to thee."
226,I,
227,I,"_Didymus._ I thank thee, boy, for I may fall asleep."
228,I,
229,I,"_The Child._ Rather shalt wake, and from thy doubt be born!"
230,I,"Lean so, against my knee."
231,I,
232,I,"[The Child _plays, a long time_."
233,I,
234,I,"O Didymus,"
235,I,"With thy shut eyes, thy youth undedicate,"
236,I,Tell me the name of this new pastoral.
237,I,
238,I,"_Didymus_ (_asleep_). He said: “My yoke is sweet, My burden light.”"
239,I,"O light, O sweet, perchance, as it was said!"
240,I,
241,I,_The Child._ True heart! The hour rounds up; thy wine-press waits;
242,I,And so this music fades: the silver tones
243,I,"Thin out, and faintly drip delight, and cease,"
244,I,"No willing man nor bird hears how. Good-night,"
245,I,O soon-made-perfect!
246,I,
247,I,
248,I,----------------------------------------------------------------------
249,I,
250,II,II
251,II,
252,II,"_Night. The same fields._ Didymus _wakes, alone_."
253,II,
254,II,----------------------------------------------------------------------
255,II,
256,II,"_Didymus._           It is black, and chill."
257,II,"My little piper’s gone.... How I have dreamed,"
258,II,"How I have dreamed! Lord, gather quietly"
259,II,All wild hearts like mine own into Thy hand.
260,II,Yet on the look of these fresh-kindled stars
261,II,"I feed, as if their bright benignant lips"
262,II,"Betimes had kissed the fever out of me,"
263,II,"And given to me their seat in warless air,"
264,II,"Their naked majesty, their poignant calm."
265,II,"Not less remote my spirit, not less free,"
266,II,After this unimaginable sleep;
267,II,"Having changed place, indeed, poor moth that was!"
268,II,With vast abiding things: for now are cast
269,II,"Old bonds, old ardors, expectation, ease,"
270,II,"Glory and death, belovèd land and sea."
271,II,"Even as walled frost that feels the solar ray,"
272,II,"Curls up, impermanent, and reels far down"
273,II,"In long blue films, elfin, processional,"
274,II,"While the built stones fall to their first grave hue,"
275,II,De-silvered: so the awful powers of earth
276,II,Exhale from me who stand the same; for these
277,II,"Are vain, these are phantasmal, but not I."
278,II,"At last I know myself, and know my need"
279,II,"As simply as a young child might, who cries"
280,II,For honey from his father’s liberal hive.
281,II,I will go down at dawn; I will seek out
282,II,"The Christian bishop, who shall lift me up,"
283,II,"A soul baptized.... Some lanthorn is beyond,"
284,II,"And moving. Hail, there! Would that I could say,"
285,II,“The gods be kind to thee!”
286,II,
287,II,"_A Voice._                  And why not, friend?"
288,II,"Thou greetest Cratidas, an old sad man,"
289,II,On his home-going track.
290,II,
291,II,_Didymus._               I too would house
292,II,A head as sad as thine: pause but a space;
293,II,I’ll find thee on the road. Now pray thee tell
294,II,"Whose farms are these? His little herd-boy passed,"
295,II,"And spake or sang to me: Oh, if he were"
296,II,"An angel, or a Greater!"
297,II,
298,II,_Cratidas._             What art thou?
299,II,
300,II,_Didymus._ One from the camp Nicopolis.
301,II,
302,II,"_Cratidas._                             I ask,"
303,II,"Leal to the State, or Christian?"
304,II,
305,II,"_Didymus._                       In this dark,"
306,II,"Imperial Diocletian’s telltale dark,"
307,II,"And even to the sober ears of eld,"
308,II,"What danger in the word! But now and here,"
309,II,Danger I love as if she were my fawn.
310,II,Turn the lamp full this way: I’ll answer thee.
311,II,A true-accounted Christian I am not:
312,II,Afar from them my nurture; but I heard
313,II,"How my young mother, long now in her urn,"
314,II,Received them: whence aroma of their prayers
315,II,"Haunted our dwelling ever. In the wars,"
316,II,"I have been sick with longing and half-faith,"
317,II,"Last year and this; that prickle has lived on,"
318,II,Till every natural mirth is dead in me.
319,II,"In the shunned name of Christ, I know not how,"
320,II,Some harvest of mine innermost desire
321,II,"Is sown, is springing up. Art satisfied,"
322,II,Father who servest Jove?
323,II,
324,II,_Cratidas._              Accursèd creed!--
325,II,"Sir, there my hasty tongue spake for my heart."
326,II,"A rebel girl I loved forsook me late,"
327,II,Bit with the Galilean pestilence.
328,II,"It rages, and it rots our best: be warned."
329,II,I am no spy; I will befriend thee. Come.
330,II,
331,II,_Didymus._ Thou livest nigh?
332,II,
333,II,_Cratidas._ Not far. Where yon sole gem
334,II,"Swings from the new moon’s girdle, is my hearth,"
335,II,"’Twixt grove and grove: a solitary place,"
336,II,Since Theodora went. Hark!...
337,II,
338,II,_Didymus._                    Sound of horror!
339,II,The city’s anger must be under it.
340,II,
341,II,"_Cratidas._ Ah me, I tremble: my poor lamb’s the cause"
342,II,"Of such blind fury. Bitter, is it not,"
343,II,"That her last kinsman, hearing, cannot help her?"
344,II,
345,II,"_Didymus._ Cratidas, I would help! Read possible aid"
346,II,In this firm-sinewed arm. Speak.
347,II,
348,II,"_Cratidas._                      That I do,"
349,II,As unto a well-wisher. I distrust
350,II,"Our fickle and tempestuous populace,"
351,II,"Greek, Roman, Jew, Egyptian, multiform."
352,II,"Ah, the uproar! I had not thought to find it"
353,II,"So fierce, so soon."
354,II,
355,II,_Didymus._          Speak quickly!
356,II,
357,II,_Cratidas._                        Loose my wrist.
358,II,Many light things are heavy to the old:
359,II,"Therefore, let me not feel thy touch again,"
360,II,"The while I talk, and guide across the dew.--"
361,II,"I, weeping in the hall, some three days since,"
362,II,"Saw Theodora tried. Aloft he sat,"
363,II,"Eustratius Proculus: no steely man,"
364,II,"But wise and gracious, in the prefect’s chair."
365,II,I do not blame him. (Mark the sudden gaps
366,II,"Along our path.) Eustratius Proculus,"
367,II,"The gold and purple fringing his white robe,"
368,II,"In a domed chamber, on a curving throne;"
369,II,"And next the lighted jasper altar, wheeled"
370,II,"Far up the floor, boxed incense piled thereby,"
371,II,"Tall Theodora, like the lotus-flower"
372,II,"That rides a flooded stream; lictors and priests,"
373,II,"Notaries, naked executioners,"
374,II,Ranged thick about. The prefect so began:
375,II,"“Proclaim thyself.” “A maid named Theodora,"
376,II,"Ward of her aged cousin, Cratidas.”"
377,II,"“What is thine age?” “They tell me, seventeen years.”"
378,II,“And thy condition?” Whereto she replied:
379,II,“Christ’s.” Very patiently he asked:
380,II,“Art bond or free?” as runs the rote of law.
381,II,She smiled in answering: “Free: made free by Christ;
382,II,"Else, of free parents honorably born,"
383,II,"Rhoxis and Heräis, who both are dead.”"
384,II,"“Then why unmarried?” “For Christ’s sake,” she said,"
385,II,“I have been busied with the things of Christ:”
386,II,"(For none could quench that hectic “Christ” in her,"
387,II,Poor fool!) Then spake Eustratius Proculus:
388,II,“Our code imperial deals with virgins thus:
389,II,"Either unto the gods they sacrifice,"
390,II,Or in an infamous place shall be exposed.
391,II,"Come: one small grain within the brazier dropped,"
392,II,"And thou dost forfeit all pollution so,"
393,II,"Nor lose thy burial-rites.” She, blanching not,"
394,II,"Looked up. “Thou art not ignorant, nor I,"
395,II,How man’s coöperate or revolted will
396,II,"Doth color, in the councils of high Heaven,"
397,II,"Both what we do, and suffer. Violence,"
398,II,"Though sent to seek my soul, shall by her gate"
399,II,Sit pilgrim-meek. Christ keeps His citadel.”
400,II,"The prefect bent again, compassionate:"
401,II,“O girl! rememberest not thy sires august?
402,II,"Pity thy beauty, heirloom of their house,"
403,II,And precious most in thee. Choose to obey;
404,II,Since even thee my duty cannot spare.”
405,II,"But she: “The nail-pierced Hands that have my vow,"
406,II,"Defend it.” “Save thyself,” he cried, “and trust"
407,II,No crucifièd ghost. From foul disgrace
408,II,"Snatch thine own youth.” And she: “Behold, I do."
409,II,"Christ is my source of honor, and mine end:"
410,II,Christ shall be my preserver.” Next I heard:
411,II,“Buffet her twice.” Then: “Wilt thou sacrifice?”
412,II,My Theodora of the reddened cheek
413,II,"Seemed absent from the body for a space,"
414,II,"Before she uttered: “No.” “Child, I am grieved"
415,II,"For such affront, which all our city sees."
416,II,"Thy quality invites another usage,"
417,II,"Wert thou not crazed.” He paused, being full of ruth;"
418,II,"But self-relentless, she in that same pause"
419,II,"Brake forth: “O my one Wisdom, O my Joy!”"
420,II,"And last, Eustratius Proculus rose up:"
421,II,"“The edict! Let it work. I dally not,"
422,II,For loyal and immovable regard
423,II,"Unto mine Emperor.” “Bid me stand as true,”"
424,II,"She murmured, “in allegiance to a Power,"
425,II,Before whom sceptred Diocletian shines
426,II,"Brief as this puffing coal.” “Ai, blasphemy!”"
427,II,The vast crowd thundered. So they led her down
428,II,Into a three days’ torture in the prison;
429,II,"And to the draped tribunal, all unchanged,"
430,II,"This eve she came. Said I, indeed, unchanged?"
431,II,Her spirit and speech were that; her body swayed
432,II,Hither and thither: a candle in a draught.
433,II,"Some scrupled naught to praise such blithe disdain,"
434,II,"Immaculate, illumined; who e’er knew"
435,II,Disdain could wear a look so like to Love’s?
436,II,And thrice Eustratius Proculus read out
437,II,"Sentence, whereby the virgin Theodora,"
438,II,"A Christian obdurate and impious,"
439,II,"Must die indeed, but first must be immured,"
440,II,"Until the day break, in the house of shame."
441,II,He ended: “May thy God for thee achieve
442,II,"The best He can!” She added: “Ay, He will."
443,II,"As Daniel from the lions, from the deeps"
444,II,Jonah; from furnace-heats the unbought three;
445,II,Peter from dungeon chains; as yesterday
446,II,"Our Agnes from the Roman ignominy,"
447,II,Shall I be rescued: He is faithful yet.”
448,II,"Softly she prayed: “Lord, Lord! deliver straight"
449,II,"Thy bounden servant, overshadowing"
450,II,"Thine own, in dread mid-battle, with Thy wing."
451,II,"Out of Thy mercy, let them harm me not:"
452,II,"By thy most bitter Passion borne for man,"
453,II,"O Fount of chastity, O Fortitude"
454,II,"Of all Thy saints, Jesu! remember me.”"
455,II,"Thus, in that voice which I shall hear no more."
456,II,"I turned away, dragging my leaden limbs"
457,II,"Hillward, and homeward."
458,II,
459,II,"_Didymus._              And these shouts, these shouts,"
460,II,"Incessant, brutal, terrible, they mean--"
461,II,
462,II,_Cratidas._  That now the lictors drive her forth; they mean
463,II,Quick menace to a never-soilèd blossom
464,II,"Of Hellas come, and her heroic seed."
465,II,"Ah, well: she will recant; she must recant.--"
466,II,"My young hound bays her welcome. Enter, sir.--"
467,II,What! Gone? An armored man swooped like a hawk
468,II,Down the sheer ledges to the city’s core?
469,II,"Beware, my fiery nameless half-a-Christian,"
470,II,"Hot for romance, beneath the stars of spring!"
471,II,"Well, well, well, well! Down, Demo. I believe"
472,II,"He’ll somehow free her: we shall have her back,"
473,II,Good Demo.... Tut! of all the wild hawk-swoops!

486,III,"Beating the human hurricane outside,"
487,III,"To reach thee first of any. Piteous thing,"
488,III,Flutter not to and fro; thy net is cut:
489,III,"No carrion crow shall ever prey on thee,"
490,III,"White dove! The evil room’s alive with light,"
491,III,"Thy light shed out; nor am I longer dark,"
492,III,"Who see, feel, bathe in it. Oh, what a stream,"
493,III,"Full from within, as through a lattice door,"
494,III,Widens around thee in an aureole;
495,III,"From lifted eyes, loose hair, and hands unlocked,"
496,III,"Gushes the even glory! While I look,"
497,III,"So bright, thou seraph of the golden blood,"
498,III,"Rains that pure fire on me, that now I know"
499,III,"Of what clear essence thou, not less am I;"
500,III,"Yea, I with thee, and all my thoughts with thine,"
501,III,Run up before our God in one straight flame.
502,III,"Child, I am here to help thee: Didymus,"
503,III,A Cappadocian.
504,III,
505,III,"_Theodora._    Heaven be thanked, and thou,"
506,III,For I believe thee! Cappadocia:
507,III,Was it not there the blessed Dorothy
508,III,"Brought apples to her lover, after death,"
509,III,In token of the riches of that orchard
510,III,Where Christ walks with His own? Let us go thither.
511,III,
512,III,"_Didymus._ Ah, muse no more."
513,III,
514,III,_Theodora._                 The Lord abide with thee!
515,III,
516,III,_Didymus._ Though unto me thy voice be like the foam
517,III,"Upon a wave of quiet, thy delay"
518,III,"Dearer than wine of roses, rouse thee: haste!"
519,III,How else can I the pact maintain with Him
520,III,Who bade me loose thee from the snare? Come nigh:
521,III,Doff thine apparel; put mine armor on.
522,III,"Think but of flight, and safety."
523,III,
524,III,"_Theodora._                      Wingèd one,"
525,III,"Best brother, brighter than a star, and stronger,"
526,III,Uphold me!
527,III,
528,III,"_Didymus._ Bind thy locks. Alas, I am"
529,III,"No angel sent of Christ, nor yet a Christian."
530,III,
531,III,"_Theodora._ Why dwell in lowland shadow? Thou, ere long,"
532,III,Must drink of grace divine the deathless light.
533,III,"On, happy soul: for there are hills to climb,"
534,III,E’en Calvary hill.
535,III,
536,III,_Didymus._         Art thou not vested yet?
537,III,"The minutes seethe and rush. Oh, had I time,"
538,III,I’d tell thee of my pangs: how it has been
539,III,From march to march with me; how vehemently
540,III,"The sluices brake in this tormented heart,"
541,III,"Last night, ten lives ago; how on yon heights"
542,III,"A boy, (not sweeter Hyacinthus was,)"
543,III,Having a pensive garland of green thorns
544,III,"Intrailed among his auburn curls, came by,"
545,III,"And with his new-cut reed, and myrrhy lip,"
546,III,Entranced me into slumber; how I saw
547,III,"Thy foster-father, and walked on with him,"
548,III,And heard thy sacred story: thence I sprang
549,III,"Into this hell, where I for thee shall answer."
550,III,"And do thou plead with Christ, for me His thrall."
551,III,
552,III,"_Theodora._ The thong: pray knot it! Gentle Didymus,"
553,III,Here is my robe: the stuff is torn; the stains
554,III,"Began ’neath sharpened spikes, the hooks, the rack."
555,III,
556,III,"_Didymus._ For dress of mine, good in the foray once,"
557,III,"That keeps thee and a holy dream intact,"
558,III,"Thou giv’st me this, strangely to make of me"
559,III,"The athlete of thy Lord. Well, give it so:"
560,III,"I kiss each dear and venerable stain,"
561,III,And lay the rended linen over me:
562,III,Would I were worthier!
563,III,
564,III,_Theodora._            Cratidas the fond
565,III,"Has somehow faded from me, and our roof"
566,III,"Among the date-palms, and my dial old,"
567,III,Set in the myrtle plot that takes the sun.
568,III,But thou art close and real: thou hast seen
569,III,"The Mystical, the Virgin-born: his name"
570,III,"Not Hyacinthus, but Emmanuel."
571,III,"(Much have I startled thee, who art so brave!)"
572,III,None shared with me that vision until now.
573,III,"It was to Him I pledged my early troth,"
574,III,"Towards whom I live, for whom I look to die;"
575,III,"Whose love was sovereign healing unto me,"
576,III,When late within the torture-cell I lay.
577,III,"His chosen other, kneel not thou to me!"
578,III,"There is a Hand that will not let thine fall,"
579,III,As mine doth.
580,III,
581,III,_Didymus._    Sign me slowly with the cross.
582,III,
583,III,_Theodora._ So: on predestined brows.
584,III,
585,III,"_Didymus_ (_after a pause_).      Thy sandal’s fast,"
586,III,"The breastplate firm and fine, each joint in place;"
587,III,Draw low the vizor; let the short cloak hang;
588,III,"And stoop in issuing forth: step hurriedly,"
589,III,"As one ashamed, whom his loud sins pursue."
590,III,"Go thus, secure."
591,III,
592,III,_Theodora._      Thou shalt not always hunger!
593,III,O thy requital: might I see it!
594,III,
595,III,_Didymus._                        Go:
596,III,"Go, even as I said."
597,III,
598,III,_Theodora._         I am so weak:
599,III,What if I cannot?
600,III,
601,III,"_Didymus._        Hush: unbar the door,"
602,III,"And front the pack.--My sister, my twin-born,"
603,III,Live thy sequestered life; and pray for me.
604,III,
605,III,[Theodora _goes_.
606,III,
607,III,"Ah, gracer of our Roman mail! I hear"
608,III,"No smallest rumor that her passage makes,"
609,III,Not one least vicious snarl or jeer the more.
610,III,"I dare to dream Thou hast accepted this,"
611,III,"My true task in the world! By now, I think,"
612,III,She leaves behind the fetid neighborhood;
613,III,"A moment more, and her accustomed feet"
614,III,Will be among the vineyards and the folds.
615,III,"The little weary feet wounded for Thee,"
616,III,Do Thou sustain!... They come.

631,IV,Would swear he heard the angry equinox
632,IV,Gorging and emptying the island caves:
633,IV,"A swash of death, where he had hoped for haven."
634,IV,"Whence the commotion, that, from well-earned beds"

645,IV,"A slim maid that was shut ’twixt four known walls,"

647,IV,Whom seven men and myself barely haled hither.

650,IV,"No trick hath been, nor am I one transformed."
651,IV,"Whom late ye thought to have, lo, ye have lost;"
652,IV,"And whom ye have unwitting, ye may keep."
653,IV,There is a twofold glory on the hour:
654,IV,"A virgin is a virgin still, and I,"
655,IV,"The empire’s soldier, champion of her King."

680,IV,"The trumpeters, for I this cause arraign"
681,IV,In open air.

683,IV,[_The trumpets sound._
684,IV,

699,IV,
700,IV,_A Voice._              Thy Theodora--
701,IV,

707,IV,"Who art thou, chief in this unseemly brawl?"
708,IV,
709,IV,"_Didymus._ One new to camp and city, one indeed"
710,IV,"No alien, but your servant in the wars,"
711,IV,Beneath the imperial eagles now three years:
712,IV,"Octavius Didymus, centurion."
713,IV,
714,IV,"_The Prefect._ A Roman, then. What of thy friend, the woman,"
715,IV,Duly condemned for heinous sacrilege?
716,IV,
717,IV,_Didymus._ The innocent Theodora is set free.
718,IV,"In as a thief came I who gave such good,"
719,IV,"But never greeted her, nor saw, nor heard,"
720,IV,Up to our late accost in this vile pen.
721,IV,
722,IV,"_A Voice._ How now, neighbors? A joker."
723,IV,
724,IV,_Another Voice._                      Or a liar.

726,IV,"_The Crowd._ More like, a fellow-Christian."
727,IV,
728,IV,_Didymus._                      Why a Christian?
729,IV,
730,IV,"_The Prefect._ If not a Christian, it rejoiceth me,"
731,IV,Aweary grown of all the casuist breed.
732,IV,I deem thou art sincere. The charge is light;
733,IV,"The penalty shall therefore too be light,"
734,IV,Since thou thyself of prior circumstance
735,IV,Wert plainly unaware; and forasmuch
736,IV,"In thy regard, our judged idolatress"
737,IV,"Was one with any whimsied wench, cajoling"
738,IV,A frolic hand to let her out o’ doors.
739,IV,
740,IV,"_Didymus._ Let us not fail in truth: sir, I knew this."
741,IV,My soul’s defiance glowed in all I wrought.
742,IV,
743,IV,"_A Voice._ By Pompey’s certain pillar, he’s a Christian!"
744,IV,"The prancing gesture, see: the head upcast,"
745,IV,"The bosom all in a white wrath, and yet"
746,IV,Bridled and bitted: that’s their duplex way.
747,IV,

752,IV,
753,IV,"_The Prefect._               Prisoner,"
754,IV,"Attend, and ease our cares. Obediently"
755,IV,Unto the known gods wilt thou sacrifice?
756,IV,
757,IV,[Didymus _is silent_.
758,IV,
759,IV,Art thou a Christian: nay?
760,IV,
761,IV,_Didymus._                 Tell me.
762,IV,
763,IV,"_The Prefect._                      Alas,"
764,IV,"Why loath to sacrifice? Do thou but so,"
765,IV,"Irreverence to the law shall be condoned,"
766,IV,"And for the brave adventure of a night,"
767,IV,No tax be laid.
768,IV,
769,IV,_Didymus._       I sacrifice no more.
770,IV,Who hath inspired me? I can but attest
771,IV,One Infinite loved her for her confident eyes.
772,IV,Would we were open to the heart of things!
773,IV,"For if He keeps without spot, as some say,"
774,IV,"Those leal to Him, is it not wonderful?"
775,IV,"And Him thus fair reputed, Him untried,"
776,IV,"Shall I reject? I sacrifice no more,"
777,IV,"Save to the Living: save to Him who died,"
778,IV,And rose again.
779,IV,
780,IV,_The Bailiff._  Ye hear.
781,IV,
782,IV,_A Voice._               A leprous word!
783,IV,
784,IV,_The Prefect._ It is a difficult hour: I must comport
785,IV,"Myself within mine office, steadfastly."
786,IV,Bring me the writ. One act is mine to do:
787,IV,Another time for fond alternatives!
788,IV,"Though fain to spare, fain to respect in thee,"
789,IV,"Arms, broadening empire, and invincible Rome,"
790,IV,"I that would never, fighting civic harm,"
791,IV,"See Diocletian fail, nor have it said"
792,IV,"Great Decius and Valerian failed before,"
793,IV,"Rise to the common weal, and so bar out"
794,IV,Contagion from our long inviolate air.
795,IV,
796,IV,_Didymus._ I feel the little lovely kiss of death

804,IV,
805,IV,"_Didymus._ These have made me Thine, O Christ!"

808,IV,Name but thy young confederate’s hiding-place.
809,IV,
810,IV,"_Didymus._ I know not, sir, where Theodora is."
811,IV,She passed: and I remain.... Demonic laughter!
812,IV,I would I had said less: it saddens me.
813,IV,"In all this swarm, there figures verily"
814,IV,Not one that will believe; not one kind soul
815,IV,"But is so sodden with the slime of life,"
816,IV,"(Life pagan, and without our Star,) that he"
817,IV,"Must read awry, and slander my fair deed."
818,IV,"Ah, if they knew: but wherefore should they know?"
819,IV,"Lord, fold amid the leafage of my heart"
820,IV,Her lilied memory! I will strive no more;
821,IV,"But turn to Thee, away from time and tears,"
822,IV,A melting snowflake in Thy mercy’s sea.
823,IV,
824,IV,_The Prefect._ Disperse.

828,IV,"_A Voice._               Our novel damsel, fallen dumb,"
829,IV,On the good public flint shall soon strike fire;
830,IV,"And we may trap that masking man-at-arms,"
831,IV,Before a lizard gets his inch of sun.
832,IV,"Ho, ho! Away: lead on!"

849,V,
850,V,"_Didymus._ Soft is the twilight breeze, soaked full of sea."
851,V,The veiled isle yonder rears her breathing lamp;
852,V,"And under us, in hollows of the crags,"

854,V,"Across the hills, there brims a lucent tide,"
855,V,"Inaudible, yet lovelier; living gray"

878,V,They are bringing Theodora here to die.
879,V,
880,V,_The Crowd._ Victory!
881,V,
882,V,"_Didymus._ Lord my God, what hast Thou wrought?"
883,V,I tremble with the sorrow and the joy.
884,V,"The shouts, the trampling feet, renew for me"
885,V,A sacrifice I thought to make no more.
886,V,
887,V,_The Bailiff._ Drag her yet nigher.
888,V,
889,V,_The Crowd._                        She is welcome!
890,V,
891,V,_A Woman._                                          See:
892,V,Her knees are white; the gold hair brushes them;
893,V,"The glimmering breastplate, in the breaking dark,"
894,V,Shows comely.
895,V,
896,V,_A Voice._    Take it off!
897,V,
898,V,_Theodora._                Not so; not yet.
899,V,
900,V,_The Bailiff._ Then tell thine own night’s tale: there’s privilege.
901,V,
902,V,_Theodora._ A simplest tale. When dedicated hands
903,V,"Gave me this dress, lest I should suffer wrong,"
904,V,The strong disguise bred courage; but I went
905,V,Only a mile: the armor was too heavy.
906,V,"Where blossomed almonds shade the roadside well,"
907,V,"Did I fall down, aswoon; I think I swooned"
908,V,"For long; and some late revelers, passing by,"
909,V,"Found me, and with a tumult took me hither."
910,V,Fulfill your will in pity; I would rest.
911,V,
912,V,"_The Bailiff._ Half of the warrant drawn for Didymus,"
913,V,Is yet to read: thy fate and his are one.
914,V,
915,V,"_Theodora._ On Didymus? Most miserable I,"
916,V,"If he must suffer, being kind to me!"
917,V,What have ye done with Didymus?
918,V,
919,V,_Didymus._                      I am nigh.
920,V,
921,V,_Voices._ Look: they have run together! Miscreants!
922,V,
923,V,_Theodora._ O strange ordaining! Tell me: by what right
924,V,Art thou encountered on the fatal ground?
925,V,
926,V,"_Didymus._ By right more fair than thine, because, forsooth,"
927,V,"Not punished for thy planned deliverance,"
928,V,"But rather for the sacred Name, I stand"
929,V,Thus ready to the headsman. Aye: give thanks;
930,V,"Yet thou, too rash, hast clouded my last hour."
931,V,Did I not guard thee? Was my prayer in vain?
932,V,For into horror’s mouth thou hast returned.
933,V,
934,V,"_Theodora._ Nay: chide not. Test their changed intent, and mark"
935,V,"That in it lurks for me no word but “Death,”"
936,V,No word at all but dear dispassionate “Death.”
937,V,"Were I, still helpless, in dread peril caught,"
938,V,"To thy releasing hand I still had cried,"
939,V,"Who could not yield mine honor up; but this,"
940,V,"The debt of life, I can myself discharge."
941,V,"And if I die not so for Christ, to-morrow"
942,V,Will these be angered less with me? and then
943,V,"For taking flight, for guiltiness of thy guilt,"
944,V,"My helper, shall I not less nobly die?"
945,V,"Was it from martyrdom erewhile I ran,"
946,V,Or only from the maw of wickedness?
947,V,And lightly I relinquished unto thee
948,V,"My girlish raiment, not my soul and self:"
949,V,My fond profession of the Christian name.
950,V,"Would he deprive me now of my last due,"
951,V,Greatly deceives me one I thought my friend!
952,V,"What will become of me if thou shouldst go,"
953,V,Alone? That cruel hour would strike away
954,V,"My second sentence, glad, desirable,"
955,V,And lower me to the insupportable first.
956,V,Leave me not to the torment; rather share
957,V,The blessedness; be jealous even for me!
958,V,Let it forevermore of thee be told
959,V,How from the thousand hands of a brute foe
960,V,Thou savedst once the spouse of Christ for Him.
961,V,"Ah, Didymus, Didymus! of the eternal crown"
962,V,Rob me not thou: for thine to thee I gave.
963,V,
964,V,"_Didymus._ Thy sovereign pinion overmasters harm,"
965,V,"Life, Death, and me: and if I feared, I erred."
966,V,We shall not be divided: and therefore
967,V,"Blessèd be One who hath despised me not,"
968,V,"And, of His clemency, absolved from ill"
969,V,His handmaid Theodora.
970,V,
971,V,"_Theodora._            Blessèd He,"
972,V,"Towards only children twain, most merciful"
973,V,"Both in the olden time, and unto us,"
974,V,"Who so, in triumph, wait our vigil’s close."
975,V,"O Light from Heaven, break, break!"
976,V,
977,V,"_The Bailiff._                     Attend, all men:"
978,V,"Heed how to deal with perished Christian swine,"
979,V,"For much the law doth vary, touching them."
980,V,"And since, too oft, their kind do set a watch,"
981,V,"And, ere the wild beasts from their lairs descend,"
982,V,"Conceal their bodies elsewhere, ’tis decreed"
983,V,"That these upon the bordering desert straight,"
984,V,"Shall, after death, be burned."
985,V,
986,V,_The Crowd._                   It suits us well.
987,V,
988,V,"_Theodora._ Then not to secret chambers of the rock,"
989,V,"Our own, with hymnal rite, shall lead us home;"
990,V,"Not to our natural nest beside the sea,"
991,V,"Above blown Pharos and the trader’s sail,"
992,V,"Where, day and night, the Eucharistic Love"
993,V,"Broods over us, shall thou and I be borne,"
994,V,"And laid amid our fathers in the Faith,"
995,V,Sleep the good sleep of immortality.
996,V,Not one small tress of ours shall reverence save;
997,V,No fragment of our interchangèd garb
998,V,"Be shrined forever, nor ascetic lips"
999,V,"Embrace, in our carved names, the Crucified."
1000,V,"God’s Will be done, and done with all accord"
1001,V,"In all! and may He grant that unto thee,"
1002,V,"(Who art both more and less than neophyte,)"
1003,V,Denial of that quiet sepulture
1004,V,Be not so keen a pain.--His look’s afar:
1005,V,He has not answered.
1006,V,
1007,V,_Didymus._           ... Whole on every side!
1008,V,"Whole, boundless, and immingled: not a chink"
1009,V,"In tremulous textures of this bubbly world,"
1010,V,Where spirits might slip through. O spacious hour
1011,V,"Of ocean-distances, air-altitudes,"
1012,V,Pearl cloudless rounding over waveless pearl:
1013,V,Pure Mediterranean! bland Africa!
1014,V,Ignoble are the dreams that make of you
1015,V,Mere ante-room; and ante-room to--what?
1016,V,"True to original and terminal earth,"
1017,V,"Rather may royal man, ensphered so fair,"
1018,V,"His chemic end not thanklessly salute,"
1019,V,"When too soon, from our arc of known content,"
1020,V,"We blunder, poor blithe faces, to the Void."
1021,V,"That spark once fallen, can it live again?"
1022,V,"If poets weep, if just Aurelius"
1023,V,"Evade, if wistful Plato pause unsure,"
1024,V,"Ah, who art Thou that biddest me believe?"
1025,V,
1026,V,"_Theodora._ Encased in thy so serviceable steel,"
1027,V,"Against my bosom, I have kept for thee"
1028,V,An aromatic and a covered cup.
1029,V,"Come hither: drain it. Sudden over me,"
1030,V,"While I lay stricken, ere my captors came,"
1031,V,"There bent the childish Shepherd of the hills,"
1032,V,"Austerer than his wont, and uttered low:"
1033,V,"“Wake, Theodora! Bear to Didymus,"
1034,V,"Whom, spent in final battle, thou shalt meet,"
1035,V,"A little draught of mingled wine and dew,"
1036,V,"For baptism, and viaticum.”"
1037,V,
1038,V,_Didymus._                  I hear.
1039,V,"A stupor, a temptation, clogged my brain:"
1040,V,Gone evermore.--What hast thou been to me!
1041,V,"In any of God’s halls where I may find Him,"
1042,V,I seek thee also there: O dove! thou knowest
1043,V,Thy hidden heavenly way through words withheld.
1044,V,"I kneel, but cords impede my hands. Pour thou,"
1045,V,"Till I have slaked a supersensual thirst,"
1046,V,"And, faint with salutation, drink to Him,"
1047,V,"Christ Jesu, whom in dying I adore."
1048,V,

1055,V,
1056,V,"_Didymus._                      Ye worthy men,"
1057,V,"I would not stay you long. Of Didymus,"
1058,V,Who made his port of intellectual storm
1059,V,"At Alexandria, tell only this:"
1060,V,"That he for Christ died Christian, with clear joy."
1061,V,"And when his comrades from their outpost ride,"
1062,V,"And, reining in abreast, ask news of him,"
1063,V,"Lay in their wondering ears, I charge you all,"
1064,V,"That word miraculous, that happy word."
1065,V,

1087,V,"So vast, so bitter, and so ever-during,"
1088,V,Burns sweet before Our Lord: love’s last slow grain
1089,V,"Rich as the first: for lo, the censer’s broken;"
1090,V,And all my soul foreruns her call to climb
1091,V,"Out of this ruin. Lest I slip, or cry,"
1092,V,"O visible form of light, dear Didymus!"
1093,V,Turn now: give me thy hand.
