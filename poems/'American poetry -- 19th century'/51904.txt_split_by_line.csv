183,INTRODUCTION.,"Henry Reed Conant was born in Janesville, Wis., on the seventeenth"
184,INTRODUCTION.,"day of February, 1872. When four years of age he removed to Vermont,"
185,INTRODUCTION.,the native state of his parents Henry Clay and Dora Evaline (Reed)
186,INTRODUCTION.,Conant. Henry was educated in the public schools and at the Morrisville
187,INTRODUCTION.,"“People’s Academy,” Vermont, and in his fifteenth year returned to the"
188,INTRODUCTION.,west.
189,INTRODUCTION.,
190,INTRODUCTION.,"He inherited from his New England ancestors a deep love of nature, and"
191,INTRODUCTION.,"pronounced religious and moral strength, which tinge the whole body"
192,INTRODUCTION.,of his rhymes and poems. Like many poets in their juvenile days Mr.
193,INTRODUCTION.,"Conant’s first lines were simple and artless, and the world of critics"
194,INTRODUCTION.,can hardly assail him for penning his first rhymes in honor of his
195,INTRODUCTION.,"“first love,” thus:"
196,INTRODUCTION.,
197,INTRODUCTION.,“Of all the lassies in the land
198,INTRODUCTION.,"That e’er I chanced to view,"
199,INTRODUCTION.,Methinks the fairest one I saw
200,INTRODUCTION.,Had sparkling eyes of blue.”
201,INTRODUCTION.,
202,INTRODUCTION.,"His first published poem appeared in a little story paper, February,"
203,INTRODUCTION.,"1890, at Belvidere, Ills. Nearly all of Mr. Conant’s poems were written"
204,INTRODUCTION.,"in Wisconsin, his native state. The selected poems forming this volume"
205,INTRODUCTION.,reflect the young poet’s individuality to a sensible degree. The trend
206,INTRODUCTION.,of his thoughts and genius is toward the more solemn and religious
207,INTRODUCTION.,"aspects of nature, and of human experience. He dwells in the forest’s"
208,INTRODUCTION.,"shade, on the banks of rivers flowing through lea and woodland, by"
209,INTRODUCTION.,"the grave of a little child, and wanders back to his old New England"
210,INTRODUCTION.,home--to the scenes of his childhood.
211,INTRODUCTION.,
212,INTRODUCTION.,"Henry Reed Conant, like many other beginners in the literary arena,"
213,INTRODUCTION.,commits his poems to a critical public with the full consciousness
214,INTRODUCTION.,"of their poetical deficiencies. Criticism he must await, and gladly"
215,INTRODUCTION.,accept as the basis of that future development through which every poet
216,INTRODUCTION.,must pass ere he attain that popular following that is the reward not
217,INTRODUCTION.,"only of genius, but of bitter disappointments."
