1466,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],To all the land we wrote.
1467,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We went to meet the postman.
1468,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We read the Boston note:
1469,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1470,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],“In Union only is there strength;
1471,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And strength is all our stay.
1472,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Alas that some divide us!
1473,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Alas that some give way!
1474,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Once none would touch a thing they tax;
1475,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"To-day the weak agree,"
1476,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"And say: ‘Enough if none will taste,"
1477,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],If none will trade in tea.’[9]
1478,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The lords have found our weakness out;
1479,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And now are talking thus:
1480,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],That India’s losing traders
1481,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],May bring tea free to us.[10]
1482,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Ay, ay, as if these would not heap"
1483,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Her lap with tribute gold,"
1484,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"‘Let them,’ says England, ‘take the tax;"
1485,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Let them the duties hold.’
1486,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1487,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“Already bound for Boston,"
1488,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"May tea be on the waves,"
1489,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],A bait flung out to tempt us
1490,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"To touch, and then be slaves."
1491,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"And if our strong men falter,"
1492,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Nor thrust this bait away,"
1493,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],How can the weak be kept from all
1494,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],That makes us England’s prey?
1495,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1496,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“And yet, if we in Boston"
1497,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"To thwart the throne conspire,"
1498,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Our town may prove an altar,"
1499,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Our fortunes melt in fire.
1500,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The sacrifice is ready;
1501,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Yet first we wait reply,[11]"
1502,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],To know we own a country
1503,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"To save, before we die.”[12]"
1504,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1505,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We met, and swore together,"
1506,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"If fighting must be done,"
1507,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"In Boston we would do it,"
1508,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We boys of Lebanon.
1509,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1510,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We started out at midnight,"
1511,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"And took the Indian suits,"
1512,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Our fathers’ trophies from the wars
1513,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Where all had been recruits.
1514,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1515,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We pack’d them up in knapsacks,"
1516,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And then with each a gun
1517,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And tomahawk away we walk’d
1518,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],In pairs or one by one.
1519,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],By day we kept the forests;
1520,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"But when the sun was down,"
1521,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We hurried on to Boston,"
1522,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And scatter’d through the town.
1523,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1524,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We hunted out our cousins.
1525,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We told them why we came.
1526,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“Aha,” said they, “we plot the same."
1527,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We join you in the game.”
1528,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1529,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"They show’d us then, at morning,"
1530,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"The “Tree of Liberty,”"
1531,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Where those who plann’d the Stamp Act[13]
1532,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Had hung in effigy.
1533,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],A pole was now beside it;
1534,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],A flag it bore flew high;[14]
1535,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The church bells all were ringing;
1536,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],A crowd had gather’d nigh.
1537,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“To see this tree, the agent"
1538,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Of stamps,” we heard, “resign’d."
1539,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Here too East India’s agent
1540,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Should learn the people’s mind:
1541,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The tea sent here to tax us
1542,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Untouch’d away shall go;
1543,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Or all will brand its consignee,"
1544,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Our own, our country’s foe.”[15]"
1545,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The people cheer’d the purpose;
1546,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],From lip to lip it pass’d;
1547,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The crowd about went homeward;
1548,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The sky was overcast.
1549,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1550,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Each agent heard the message;
1551,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],No promise would he sign.[16]
1552,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Again the town demanded one;
1553,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Again did each decline.[17]
1554,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Then Boston’s grand “Committee[18]
1555,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Of Correspondence,” wrote"
1556,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"To ask the farmers, “Would they stand"
1557,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],By what the town would vote?”
1558,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1559,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],From every hill and valley
1560,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Came back, as though one word,"
1561,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],What Samuel Adams read with pride
1562,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Where all the people heard:
1563,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1564,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“Without a voice dissenting,"
1565,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We swear by you to stand.
1566,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Our wealth or life preventing,"
1567,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The tea shall never land.”[18]
1568,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1569,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Then dawn’d the stirring Sunday[19]
1570,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"When swift the news was pass’d,"
1571,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"That one tea-ship they waited for,"
1572,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Was in the port at last.
1573,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Not many went to church then;
1574,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"But all began to pray,"
1575,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],With eyes to duty open wide—
1576,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The Puritanic way.
1577,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1578,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"In haste we met together,"
1579,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Our work must be begun;
1580,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We plann’d, then, how to do it,"
1581,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We boys of Lebanon.
1582,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"With Proctor[20] for our captain,"
1583,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We vow’d on hand to be,"
1584,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And cling like air and water there
1585,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],About the ship with tea.
1586,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1587,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The Town-Select-Men waited on
1588,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The vessel’s consignees;
1589,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"But these were waiting on the fort,[21]"
1590,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Well lock’d with English keys.
1591,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"True courtiers, they would tender"
1592,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The governor there their tea.
1593,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The governor tried his council;
1594,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The council[22] said: “Not we;
1595,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Our homes are with the people;
1596,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And we are not the ones
1597,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],To hold the cup of serfdom
1598,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"To them, ourselves, or sons.”"
1599,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1600,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The consignees were waiting
1601,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Until, in forms of law,"
1602,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Their tea was enter’d at the port,"
1603,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],When none could it withdraw.[23]
1604,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],So quick the Town-Committee
1605,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Had made and seal’d a writ,"
1606,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And pledg’d the vessel’s owner’s word
1607,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Not yet to enter it.[24]
1608,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1609,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"At Faneuil Hall,[25] next morning,"
1610,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"While all the bells were rung,"
1611,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Men swarm’d, like bees, to buzz before,"
1612,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Prepar’d to die, they stung."
1613,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The sheriff[26] came and cried aloud:
1614,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],“You meet unlawfully!”
1615,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"His cry but made them busier buzz,"
1616,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],With Saxon loyalty.
1617,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The consignees were summon’d;
1618,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“The tea,” they wrote, “we stack.”[27]"
1619,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“The tea shall sail for England,”"
1620,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The people answer’d back.
1621,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1622,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"And then to ports in England,"
1623,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And those at home they wrote:
1624,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“Tea-taxers here, or traders,"
1625,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Our country’s foes we vote.[28]
1626,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Think not our men will waver,"
1627,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Our wives their vows abate;
1628,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The herbs they steep for tea will keep
1629,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Less bitter than their hate.”
1630,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1631,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Two tea-ships more were sighted.[29]
1632,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Our guards, like nerves, were strung[30]"
1633,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"From bay to every belfry’s bell,"
1634,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The slightest move had rung.
1635,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1636,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Then spoke the vessels’ owners:
1637,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],“Our tea is legal prey
1638,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"For fort and fleet, if enter’d not"
1639,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Before the twentieth[31] day.”
1640,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“Then send it off to sea again,”"
1641,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The Town-Committee said.
1642,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“Too much you ask,” was answer’d,"
1643,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],“For then would blood be shed.
1644,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The port’s collector warns us
1645,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We must not clear the port.
1646,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Without his ‘Writ of Clearance,’"
1647,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We dare not brook the fort.”
1648,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],They pointed down the harbor:
1649,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"There lay the fleet,[32] alas,"
1650,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Like prongs along the channel,"
1651,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],To rake whate’er should pass.
1652,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1653,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"They pointed toward the castle,"
1654,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And all the guns within
1655,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Bespoke how they would treat a prey
1656,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],That sought the sea to win.
1657,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1658,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],At this our Town-Committee
1659,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The port’s collector sought;[33]
1660,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"The governor,[33] too, exulting[34]"
1661,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],To think his trap had caught.
1662,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],“You mark the fleet and castle;
1663,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Should trouble brew,” said he;"
1664,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“Your Hancocks, Rowes, and Phillips[34]"
1665,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Might risk as much as we.”
1666,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],But Molineux[35] said only:
1667,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],“They more would risk if slaves;
1668,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"For all they then could wish, would be"
1669,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Enough to give them graves.”
1670,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“‘If slaves’!” the governor answer’d,"
1671,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And rail’d against their cause;
1672,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“Aha!—you talk of ‘slaves,’ forsooth,"
1673,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Because your land has laws!
1674,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And you would dare to break them?—
1675,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"And reason, what of it?—"
1676,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"I trust in human nature,"
1677,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],When reason should submit.”
1678,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1679,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“We trust in human nature,”"
1680,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Said Young,[36] who near him stood;"
1681,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“And peace that brooks oppression,"
1682,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],It does not deem a good.
1683,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We trust in human nature;
1684,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"The conscience, ruling there,"
1685,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"May guard the right, full well as kings"
1686,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],With crowns their dearest care.
1687,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Love rules in human nature,"
1688,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"For, all of history through,"
1689,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"The slaves have been the many,"
1690,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The tyrants been the few.”
1691,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1692,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The governor turn’d in anger:
1693,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“Well, well, we then shall see."
1694,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Your hint of flint can wring no ‘Writ
1695,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Of Clearance’ here from me.”
1696,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1697,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Then met the town together,"
1698,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Their final vote to take.
1699,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Not one, of seven thousand[38] there,"
1700,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Desired the peace to break.
1701,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1702,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Said Quincy:[37] “Crowds and shoutings
1703,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Can never end our strife.
1704,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],But sadder scenes and sounds await
1705,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Our loss of wealth and life.
1706,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The structures fair of freedom
1707,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Men rear beneath the sky,"
1708,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Press down on deep foundations,"
1709,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Where thousands buried lie.
1710,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Our course we well may ponder:
1711,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Hope’s rainbow in the cloud
1712,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],May lure a march beneath its arch
1713,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],To flash and bolt and shroud.”
1714,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The people paused and ponder’d;
1715,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"But not a single hand,[38]"
1716,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"When call’d to vote, but voted,"
1717,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],“The tea shall never land.”
1718,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1719,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And then we met together;
1720,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"If fighting must be done,"
1721,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We knew we now should do it,"
1722,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We boys of Lebanon.
1723,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],In one day more—one only—[39]
1724,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The fleet and fort would hold
1725,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The tea that none could longer keep
1726,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],From being bought and sold.
1727,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Close by we sought our quarters;
1728,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And from our knapsacks quick
1729,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We took our Indian guises;
1730,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And stain’d our cheeks with brick.
1731,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Anon, we half were ready,"
1732,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],With tomahawks in hand[40];
1733,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"And half, with muskets only,[40]"
1734,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And heard our last command.
1735,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],A moment then we waited;
1736,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We knew the danger there;
1737,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We looked above for courage;
1738,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We bent below in prayer.
1739,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We swore by God in heaven,"
1740,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],To keep our names from all;
1741,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We swore to stand together,"
1742,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Till all in death should fall;
1743,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We swore, by truth and honor,"
1744,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Should half essay to flee,"
1745,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],To cast that half the harbor in
1746,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],To perish with the tea.[40]
1747,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1748,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The twilight long had tarried;
1749,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The darkness deeper grew;
1750,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"In old South Church, the people"
1751,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Still ponder’d what to do.
1752,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1753,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The dimness veil’d our coming.
1754,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We listen’d near the door,"
1755,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Till Samuel Adams rose and said,[41]"
1756,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],“We here can do no more.”
1757,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And then we pass’d the word on:
1758,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],“To Griffin’s wharf now!—run!”
1759,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"For we knew where to do the rest,"
1760,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We boys of Lebanon.
1761,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1762,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Then off flew some as pickets
1763,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"To stand and sound alarms,"
1764,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Should coming spies or soldiers
1765,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Compel resort to arms.
1766,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The twilight long had tarried;
1767,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The darkness deeper grew;
1768,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"“Full time,” said we, “to take our tea!”"
1769,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The people thought so too.
1770,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1771,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],To Griffin’s wharf we led them;
1772,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"We row’d, and reach’d the ships;"
1773,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"No captain there, nor sailor,"
1774,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],Dared open once his lips.
1775,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We crowded every gangway;
1776,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We brought out every chest;
1777,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],We smash’d and dash’d it overboard.
1778,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The bay did all the rest.
1779,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"No time was there for shouting,"
1780,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],No wish was there for strife;
1781,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Three hours we wrought in silence,"
1782,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],And thank’d the Lord for life.
1783,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Anon, the work was ended;"
1784,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"Anon, we back could row;"
1785,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The heaven was black above us;
1786,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],The harbor black below.
1787,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],
1788,THE LEBANON BOYS IN BOSTON.[1],"None thought on shore to cheer us,[42]"

3855,HAYDN.,
3856,HAYDN.,"This poem was suggested by the tale entitled “A First Love,” in the"
3857,HAYDN.,“Musical Sketches” of Elize Polko. Her authority for the narrative was
3858,HAYDN.,the historical fact that the wife of Haydn had a sister who was beloved
3859,HAYDN.,"by him, and who entered a convent. My own authority for the imagined"
3860,HAYDN.,connection indicated in the poem between the marriage of Haydn and the
3861,HAYDN.,"influence of the father and the priest, is derived from such passages as"
3862,HAYDN.,"these, which may be found in every biography of the musician: “Forced to"
3863,HAYDN.,"seek a lodging” (_i.e._ when a boy in Vienna), “by chance he met with"
3864,HAYDN.,"a wig-maker, named Keller, who had often noticed and been delighted"
3865,HAYDN.,"with the beauty of his voice at the Cathedral, and now offered him an"
3866,HAYDN.,asylum. This Haydn most gladly accepted; and Keller received him as a
3867,HAYDN.,"son.... His residence here had, however, a fatal influence on his after"
3868,HAYDN.,life.... Keller had two daughters; his wife and himself soon began to
3869,HAYDN.,think of uniting the young musician to one of them; and even ... ventured
3870,HAYDN.,to name the subject to Haydn.... He did not forget his promise to his
3871,HAYDN.,"old friend Keller, of his marrying his daughter.... But he soon found"
3872,HAYDN.,that she ... had ... a mania for priests and nuns.... He was himself
3873,HAYDN.,incessantly annoyed and interrupted in his studies by their clamorous
3874,HAYDN.,"conversation.... At length he separated from his wife, whom, however, he"
3875,HAYDN.,"always, in pecuniary concerns, treated with perfect honor.” _Biographical"

3877,HAYDN.,
3878,HAYDN.,"Such facts, taken in connection with the well-known piety of Haydn, are a"
3879,HAYDN.,"sufficient warrant, as I think, for my supposing that “priests and nuns”"
3880,HAYDN.,who so annoyed him had had something to do with drawing into a convent
3881,HAYDN.,that member of the family whom he had loved the most. In the poem I have
3882,HAYDN.,endeavored to bring the personality of the musician before the mind of

3965,IV.,"Would ring out, if our thoughts turn’d far from her,"
3966,IV.,"Like bells that homeward lure the wind-blown bees,"
3967,IV.,And bring our flighty fancies back again.
3968,IV.,
3969,IV.,"But Haydn liked this not, would ward it off,"
3970,IV.,And turn her chafing overcharge of nerve
3971,IV.,"From tongue to foot, with “Here, Doretta, imp!"
3972,IV.,"You cannot climb the ledge,” or “leap the brook,”"
3973,IV.,"Or “find the flowers”;—then bending down to me,"
3974,IV.,Say: “I abhor our German prudery.
3975,IV.,"We too should walk alone, or else have four,"
3976,IV.,Or six. When two agree they make a match.
3977,IV.,A third is but a wedge with which to split

3979,IV.,And once he paused with me;
3980,IV.,"And while Doretta linger’d, hid from view,"
3981,IV.,We two sat languidly upon the turf.
3982,IV.,"“Who feel like springing in the Spring?” he said,"
3983,IV.,“Yet all life may spring on as bodies do

3985,IV.,"To feel relax’d, perchance, prepares one best"
3986,IV.,To leap the hedge of each untested year;
3987,IV.,"First action, then reaction—eh, not so?—"
3988,IV.,And think—The same may form the law of souls:
3989,IV.,"They stoop, then rise; they kneel, then know of heaven,—"
3990,IV.,"And say, Pauline, if once there rose in view"
3991,IV.,"An aim sublime, to make one proud, so proud,"
3992,IV.,"Say, would he not do thus?”—"
3993,IV.,“Ha!” laugh’d a voice;
3994,IV.,And soon Doretta’s curls a shade shook down
3995,IV.,Between his face and mine. She smooth’d his brow;
3996,IV.,And with a wreath of heart’s-ease crown’d it then.
3997,IV.,"“There, there, my sweet heart, be at ease,” we heard."
3998,IV.,"“You take my head then for my heart,” he said."
3999,IV.,"“Nay, nay,” she answer’d, “nay—would crown them both;"
4000,IV.,"Your music with your muse; your head, the home;"
4001,IV.,"The mistress there, your heart.”"
4002,IV.,“With all one’s heart
4003,IV.,"But mistress of his head alone, would love"
4004,IV.,Gain much?” he ask’d.
4005,IV.,"“Immortal fame,” said she;"
4006,IV.,“Not so?”
4007,IV.,"“And do you think,” he sigh’d, “that this"
4008,IV.,"Could set the heart at ease?—or think you none,"
4009,IV.,"If set at ease, can thrill with drum-like throbs"
4010,IV.,That marshal on the spirit to success?—
4011,IV.,"You may be right. In life’s unending strife,"
4012,IV.,The wrestler the most fit to win the palm
4013,IV.,"May be the strong soul’s restlessness, while rest,"
4014,IV.,"Like sweetmeats, all too sweet, when served ere meats,"
4015,IV.,But surfeits appetite before it acts.
4016,IV.,
4017,IV.,"“But look,” he added, starting suddenly;"
4018,IV.,"“The sun has touch’d the earth. See how its disk,"
4019,IV.,"Red-hot against the river, starts the mist,"
4020,IV.,"Like steam, to drive us home.” With that we all"
4021,IV.,Walk’d home together; nor a chance was given
4022,IV.,For him to say the thing he would have said.
4023,IV.,
4024,IV.,"Yet, sister, I have lately often thought"
4025,IV.,"His lips, thus closed, were making ready then,"
4026,IV.,"When came Doretta there, to breathe to me"
4027,IV.,"What might have roused me, like a Gabriel’s trump"
4028,IV.,"When rise dead hearts at resurrection-time,"
4029,IV.,And open’d for me here a life of love.
4030,IV.,
4031,IV.,
4032,V.,V.
4033,V.,
4034,V.,"Nay, do not bid me cease. I must confess."
4035,V.,It is not discontentment with my lot.
4036,V.,"My heart, it suffocates. This feeling here,"
4037,V.,"It stifles me. I think that one might die,"
4038,V.,"Forbidden speech. Ah, friend, had you a babe,"
4039,V.,"A little puny thing that needed air,"
4040,V.,"And nursing too; and now and then a kiss,"
4041,V.,"A mother’s kiss, to quiet it; and arms,"
4042,V.,Warm arms to wrap and rock it so to sleep;
4043,V.,Would you deny it these? And yet there lives
4044,V.,A far more tender babe that God calls love;
4045,V.,"And when He sends it, why, we mortals here,—"
4046,V.,"I would not say we grudge the kiss, the clasp,—"
4047,V.,We grudge the little heavenling even air.
4048,V.,The tears will come. It makes me weep to think
4049,V.,"Of this poor gentle babe, this heir of heaven,"
4050,V.,So wronged because men live ashamed of it.
4051,V.,Not strange is it that earth knows little love
4052,V.,While all so little dare of love to speak.
4053,V.,For once (I ask no more) you must permit
4054,V.,"That I should nurse the stranger, give it air,"
4055,V.,"Ay, ay, and food, if need be; let it grow."
4056,V.,"God’s child alone, I have no fear of it."
4057,V.,
4058,V.,
4059,VI.,VI.
4060,VI.,
4061,VI.,"Long after that, our Haydn found no chance"
4062,VI.,"To talk with me; and this, I know not why."
4063,VI.,My father—I could never find out why
4064,VI.,"My father aught surmised: we walk’d alone,"
4065,VI.,"Doretta, Haydn, I—my father though"
4066,VI.,From this time seem’d less trustful; not that he
4067,VI.,"Loved less his favorite, Haydn; but we both"
4068,VI.,"Were still so young. And he, poor man, who earn’d"
4069,VI.,"With all his toil not much, had form’d a plan"
4070,VI.,"(As one might form a rosary, stringing beads,"
4071,VI.,"Then spending all his hours in counting them),"
4072,VI.,"Where hung bright hopes, but strung on flimsy thread,—"
4073,VI.,"Mere lint, brush’d off a worldling’s flattery,"
4074,VI.,"That I for wealth should wed. So, like a gem"
4075,VI.,"For future pride, he lock’d me up in school."
4076,VI.,
4077,VI.,
4078,VII.,VII.
4079,VII.,
4080,VII.,And there strange faces drove my lonely thoughts
4081,VII.,Back into memory for companionship
4082,VII.,And there imagination moved anon
4083,VII.,"To fill the void love felt in earth about,"
4084,VII.,"Invoking fancies where it found no facts,"
4085,VII.,Beheld an earth about that seemed bewitch’d.
4086,VII.,
4087,VII.,"If Haydn’s presence had my love call’d forth,"
4088,VII.,"His absence, thus conjured, (could it do else?)"
4089,VII.,"call’d forth my worship. You remember, friend,"
4090,VII.,Those heroes of old Rome appear’d not gods
4091,VII.,Till all were dead and veil’d from mortal eyes.
4092,VII.,"And so with Haydn was it, and his world,—"
4093,VII.,These never had appear’d so fill’d with light
4094,VII.,As when so far from me. The slightest hint
4095,VII.,"Of home, that made me think this home was his,"
4096,VII.,Made all things there as bright as heaven itself;—
4097,VII.,"Yes, yes, though heaven so very bright must be!—"
4098,VII.,"For even here the past is bright; and there,"
4099,VII.,"Up there, we faith shall have, such perfect faith,"
4100,VII.,That none can longer fear the future. No:
4101,VII.,As restful shall it seem as now the past;
4102,VII.,"And then with all things bright, behind, before,"
4103,VII.,"Where could a place for gloom be? Even here,"
4104,VII.,Could gloom be found if only men had faith?
4105,VII.,
4106,VII.,
4107,VIII.,VIII.
4108,VIII.,
4109,VIII.,A year pass’d over me. Can I forget
4110,VIII.,That wondrous April day that set me free?
4111,VIII.,"At first, as though I own’d no soul at all,"
4112,VIII.,"I seem’d myself a part of that wide air,"
4113,VIII.,And all things else had souls. The very earth
4114,VIII.,Beneath me seem’d alive! its pulse to throb
4115,VIII.,Through every trembling bush! its lungs to heave
4116,VIII.,Where soft-blown wind-sighs thrill’d the wooded hills!
4117,VIII.,"And then, this great life broke in many lives,"
4118,VIII.,"All one through sympathy. In lieu of clouds,"
4119,VIII.,The gusty breeze caught up the fluttering lark
4120,VIII.,And shook down showers of trills that made bare rocks
4121,VIII.,"More sweet than fount-spray’d flowers, while all the leaves"
4122,VIII.,Went buzzing on their boughs like swarming bees.
4123,VIII.,"Then reverence hush’d the whole; for, greeting me,"
4124,VIII.,"Our dear church spire seem’d soon to mount the hill,"
4125,VIII.,"Our home to reach around a slow-turn’d rock,—"
4126,VIII.,"And all stood still with Haydn. Chill as ice,"
4127,VIII.,"My hot cheek felt my sister’s kiss then, then my father’s,"
4128,VIII.,"And then bewilder’d, as from out a dream,"
4129,VIII.,At last I woke.
4130,VIII.,And what a dawn was that!
4131,VIII.,"As if the sun had drawn the earth to itself,"
4132,VIII.,"I dwelt in central light; and heaven, high heaven—"
4133,VIII.,"Could feel some rays, perhaps, was touch’d by them,"
4134,VIII.,"At star-points in the sky, but own’d no more."
4135,VIII.,
4136,VIII.,
4137,IX.,IX.
4138,IX.,
4139,IX.,Doretta in the year had grown so fair
4140,IX.,"That, in her first ripe flush of maidenhood,"
4141,IX.,"I did not wonder, while I watch’d his eyes,"
4142,IX.,"My Haydn’s eyes, that he could crave the fruit."
4143,IX.,And intimate they were. Right merrily
4144,IX.,Through all the house I heard their voices chime.
4145,IX.,But me our Haydn did not seem to know;
4146,IX.,"So quiet was he, and reserved with me."
4147,IX.,Yet all my heart would flutter like a bird’s
4148,IX.,"At his approach; and all my will fly off,"
4149,IX.,"And, as if poised in air and not in me,"
4150,IX.,"Leave half my words and ways without control,"
4151,IX.,Until I seem’d as if I prized him not.
4152,IX.,
4153,IX.,
4154,X.,X.
4155,X.,
4156,X.,But this he little mark’d. Doretta’s form
4157,X.,"Had cast a shade, perhaps, that dimm’d his view."
4158,X.,"Then, too, within the year, still subtler charms"
4159,X.,Had cast their spells about him: work had come.
4160,X.,He needed now no more to earn his bread
4161,X.,By joining us wig-makers while we plied—
4162,X.,My sister and myself—our father’s trade.
4163,X.,"The church that had dismiss’d him, when from change"
4164,X.,"It could now keep that voice, whose tones, of yore,"
4165,X.,Had touch’d my father so that heart and house
4166,X.,Had both sprung open that the sweet-voiced boy
4167,X.,"Might find a home,—the church had called him back"
4168,X.,"To aid again, but in the orchestra,"
4169,X.,The fresher singing of his younger mates.
4170,X.,With this had pupils fill’d his vacant hours
4171,X.,"And, far away, an organ, play’d at Mass,"
4172,X.,"Besiren’d all the Sundays. Thus cheer’d on,"
4173,X.,His brighten’d prospects had renew’d the charms
4174,X.,Of music rivalling all things else with him.
4175,X.,"Full often, could we watch him, listless, gaze,"
4176,X.,"Ay, even toward Doretta’s voice and form;"
4177,X.,"Then turn, like one bewildered by a dream"
4178,X.,"Fast-closing every sense to all besides,"
4179,X.,"And seek our small bare attic, where anon,"
4180,X.,"For hours together, pausing not for aught,"
4181,X.,The ringing strings within his harpsichord
4182,X.,Would seem to call toward form that formless force
4183,X.,Enrapturing so the spirit. When his moods
4184,X.,"Would note Doretta not, nor waiting meals,"
4185,X.,"Nor sunset hues, nor moonlight at its full,"
4186,X.,"Nor e’en the striking of the midnight bell,"
4187,X.,What could I think that he could care for me?
4188,X.,
4189,X.,
4190,XI.,XI.
4191,XI.,
4192,XI.,At last his illness came. How pale he lay!
4193,XI.,"We fear’d for him, lest life should slip its net:"
4194,XI.,The fleshly cords were worn to film so thin!
4195,XI.,"But how the soul would shine through them! Its light,"
4196,XI.,"I would not say that it could gladden me,"
4197,XI.,"Yet—strange is it?—while sitting near him then,"
4198,XI.,"The fresh air fanning toward him, which his lungs"
4199,XI.,"Were all too weak to draw there for themselves,"
4200,XI.,"For that so gentle, babelike sufferer,"
4201,XI.,"I lost all fear; and, true to womanhood,"
4202,XI.,I loved him more for low and helpless moans
4203,XI.,Than ever I had loved him when in health.
4204,XI.,
4205,XI.,
4206,XII.,XII.
4207,XII.,
4208,XII.,How oft I thank’d the Power that gave me power
4209,XII.,To think and do for him what he could not.
4210,XII.,I knelt: I gave my body to his needs:
4211,XII.,"Brain, hands, and all things would I yield to him."
4212,XII.,"And was I not paid back?—His dear, sweet heart,"
4213,XII.,"Each slightest beat of it, would seem to thrill"
4214,XII.,"Through all my veins, twice dear when serving two."
4215,XII.,"And this was love! You know the Master’s words,"
4216,XII.,That they alone who lose it find their life.
4217,XII.,’Tis true. No soul can feel full consciousness
4218,XII.,"Of full existence till it really love,"
4219,XII.,And yield its own to serve another’s life.
4220,XII.,"“To serve Christ’s life,” you say?—But part of that"
4221,XII.,By Christ’s humaneness is to serve mankind.
4222,XII.,"I speak a law of life, a truth of God:"
4223,XII.,To heaven I dare as little limit it
4224,XII.,"As to the earth; whatever be our sphere,"
4225,XII.,We know not life therein until we love.
4226,XII.,
4227,XII.,
4228,XIII.,XIII.
4229,XIII.,
4230,XIII.,"True love has life eternal, infinite."
4231,XIII.,"Complete within itself, and craving naught,"
4232,XIII.,"It needs no future far, nor outlet vast,"
4233,XIII.,Nor aught to feel or touch in time or space.
4234,XIII.,"A sense within, itself its own reward,"
4235,XIII.,"It waits not on return. For it, to love"
4236,XIII.,"Is better than to be loved, better far"
4237,XIII.,To be a God than man.
4238,XIII.,"At least, my love"
4239,XIII.,More further’d me than Haydn. With all I long’d
4240,XIII.,"And all I toil’d, Doretta was the one"
4241,XIII.,Who could the best succeed in aiding him.
4242,XIII.,"For she at home had dwelt, knew household ways;"
4243,XIII.,"And I was but a bungler, knew them not."
4244,XIII.,"And so to me was mainly given the task,"
4245,XIII.,"To fan him while he slept. But, when he woke,"
4246,XIII.,"Although his lips would move with no complaint,"
4247,XIII.,"Nor eyes would glance for other than myself,"
4248,XIII.,I could not do for him as then could she.
4249,XIII.,"For she would turn his pillow, tell him tales,"
4250,XIII.,"Bring books and pictures, just what pleas’d him most."
4251,XIII.,"But, ah, to me those patient eyes of his"
4252,XIII.,Appear’d such holy things! My deeds were hush’d:
4253,XIII.,I did not dare disturb the silence there.
4254,XIII.,It could not all have been mere selfishness;
4255,XIII.,Yet I to look at him was all content.
4256,XIII.,
4257,XIII.,
4258,XIV.,XIV.
4259,XIV.,
4260,XIV.,And my inaptitude my sister knew.
4261,XIV.,And partly since as well as I she knew it.
4262,XIV.,"And partly since as well as I she loved,"
4263,XIV.,"Whene’er she heard him waking, she would come"
4264,XIV.,And by him sit till fast asleep again;
4265,XIV.,And only when there thus was little left
4266,XIV.,"That could be done, would I be left to do it."
4267,XIV.,
4268,XIV.,"At times then I would lean above his couch,"
4269,XIV.,And grieve to think that I could do no more;
4270,XIV.,At times would rise in thankfulness that God
4271,XIV.,Would let me do so much. A thought like this
4272,XIV.,Perhaps He chose to bless. I came to think
4273,XIV.,"That even though I might not have her art,"
4274,XIV.,"Doretta’s art, that I at least might have"
4275,XIV.,"As much, perhaps, as guardian angels have,"
4276,XIV.,"Without our hands or voices, keeping watch"
4277,XIV.,"In spirit only. Still, when sister came,"
4278,XIV.,"The thought would come that, if their souls unseen"
4279,XIV.,"Could envy, sometimes they might envy men."
4280,XIV.,
4281,XIV.,
4282,XV.,XV.
4283,XV.,
4284,XV.,How hard I strove against this jealousy!—
4285,XV.,"Would plead with Mary, and would kneel to Christ;"
4286,XV.,And seek the priestly father and confess
4287,XV.,The feeling all to him. Nor would he chide
4288,XV.,One half as much as I would chide myself.
4289,XV.,How would he shame me that I dared to love
4290,XV.,“A man who had not ask’d me for my love!
4291,XV.,A man who loved my sister and not me!”—
4292,XV.,Then bid me count my beads for hours and hours
4293,XV.,"A week or more I slept not, counting them;"
4294,XV.,"But, while my thought was fixt but on my sin,"
4295,XV.,It seem’d my sin but grew. It grew in fact:
4296,XV.,"For on this voyage of life, not seas alone,"
4297,XV.,But skies—all things about us—mirror back
4298,XV.,The souls that they surround. With each to him
4299,XV.,"That hath, is given back more of what he hath:"
4300,XV.,"One smiles at aught, it gives him back a smile;"
4301,XV.,"He frowns, it gives a frown; he looks with love,"
4302,XV.,"He finds love; but without love, none can find it."
4303,XV.,"Alas, that men should think one secret fault"
4304,XV.,Can hide itself. Their sin will find them out.
4305,XV.,"Before, behind, from every quarter flash"
4306,XV.,"Their moods reflected. Let them tell the tale,"
4307,XV.,"Nay, let them whisper, glance, or shrug one hint"
4308,XV.,"Of what they find in earth about, and lo!"
4309,XV.,"In this, their tale of it, all read their own."
4310,XV.,
4311,XV.,
4312,XVI.,XVI.
4313,XVI.,
4314,XVI.,I wander much. There came a change at last.
4315,XVI.,"Our charge was better; and, one afternoon,"
4316,XVI.,"Almost before I found that he had waked,"
4317,XVI.,"Upon my cheeks arose a burning heat,"
4318,XVI.,"While, past a mist of tears that flow’d, there dawn’d"
4319,XVI.,"The light that waited in his clear, blue eye."
4320,XVI.,"“Pauline,” he murmur’d then, “Pauline, my friend—"
4321,XVI.,And what?—You weep for me! I shall not die.—
4322,XVI.,"Nay, do not rise, nor call Doretta yet."
4323,XVI.,"Hist, hist!—nor let her hear us. Why is this,"
4324,XVI.,That you stay never with me when I wake?
4325,XVI.,
4326,XVI.,“You think you ‘cannot do for me’?—do what?
4327,XVI.,And have I ask’d you any thing to do?—
4328,XVI.,"I pray you stay: do not do any thing,—"
4329,XVI.,"What pretty cuffs!—There, there: it still shall lie,"
4330,XVI.,The little hand; I like to look at it.—
4331,XVI.,"Who said I wish’d for books, and prints, and tales,"
4332,XVI.,And bustlings all about?—Who told you this?
4333,XVI.,"Your sister?—She a good, kind nurse has been:"
4334,XVI.,"And you, you too, have been a good, kind nurse."
4335,XVI.,"Think you that I have never lain awake,"
4336,XVI.,Nor known the long hours you have watch’d with me?—
4337,XVI.,
4338,XVI.,“What say?—‘Done’ but ‘your duty’?—Say not so.
4339,XVI.,"A friend most pleases when, forgetting due,"
4340,XVI.,"He seems to do his pleasure; but a foe,—"
4341,XVI.,Who does not shrink to feel him near enough
4342,XVI.,To freeze one with a chill though duteous touch?
4343,XVI.,Mere duty forms the body-part of love:
4344,XVI.,"Let love be present, and this body seems"
4345,XVI.,The fitting vestment of a finer life:
4346,XVI.,"Let love be gone, it leaves a hideous corpse!"
4347,XVI.,"Pauline, I crave the life, I crave the soul:"
4348,XVI.,Would you content me with a skeleton?
4349,XVI.,
4350,XVI.,“I ‘meant’ your ‘sister’? Why?—who named her?—I?—
4351,XVI.,"Name her, did I, as being duteous?—"
4352,XVI.,Who ‘mean’ I then?—You little fluttering bird
4353,XVI.,"Suppose you were some actual little bird,"
4354,XVI.,How would you tell whence came or whither went
4355,XVI.,"The wind that ruff’d your feathers?—Do you know,"
4356,XVI.,You women always will match thoughts to things?
4357,XVI.,"You chat as birds chirp, when their mates grow bright:"
4358,XVI.,You love when comes a look that smiles on you.
4359,XVI.,"We men are more creative. We love love,"
4360,XVI.,Our own ideal long before aught real:
4361,XVI.,Our halo of young fancy circles naught
4362,XVI.,Save empty sky far off.—And yet those rays
4363,XVI.,"Fit like a crown, at last, about the face"
4364,XVI.,That fortune drives between our goal and us.
4365,XVI.,
4366,XVI.,"“Yet, all may fail of truth; none fail like those"
4367,XVI.,Who deem themselves the most infallible:
4368,XVI.,"None more than men who, fallible in proof,"
4369,XVI.,Yet flout the failure of a woman’s guess.
4370,XVI.,"And your guess?—it went right. I thought of her,"
4371,XVI.,"Your sister. We both honor her, and much."
4372,XVI.,"And yet I fear her, lest her will so strong"
4373,XVI.,Should overmatch by aught your strength of will.
4374,XVI.,"For God has given you your own moods, friend;"
4375,XVI.,And are you not responsible for them?
4376,XVI.,"And if you yield them up too readily,"
4377,XVI.,"Not meaning wrong, yet may you not mistake?"
4378,XVI.,"Our lives, remember, are not sounding-boards,"
4379,XVI.,"Not senseless things, resounding for a world"
4380,XVI.,That nothing new can find in what we give.
4381,XVI.,"If one but echo back another’s note,"
4382,XVI.,Can he give forth God’s message through his own?
4383,XVI.,"Yet,—Nay, I would not chide, I caution you."
4384,XVI.,Wit heeds a hint; ’tis dulness questions it.
4385,XVI.,
4386,XVI.,"“And so you thought I wish’d my pillow turn’d,"
4387,XVI.,"And books, and tales, and bustlings all about?"
4388,XVI.,"Does not the world, then, worry life enough,—"
4389,XVI.,That one should crave for more to worry him?
4390,XVI.,Do I so lack for exercise? Ah me!
4391,XVI.,Some nervous mothers—bless them!—shake their babes.
4392,XVI.,"I never deem’d it wise; oh, no—am sure"
4393,XVI.,The friction frets the temper of the child.—
4394,XVI.,"Not natural, you see: God never shakes"
4395,XVI.,The ground with earthquakes when we wish for spring.
4396,XVI.,"He does not drive life from its germ, He draws"
4397,XVI.,"By still, bright warmth. Pauline, but look at me."
4398,XVI.,Too weak am I now to be driven to life;
4399,XVI.,"Nay, nay, but must be drawn.—And ah! could tell"
4400,XVI.,Where orbs there are more bright than suns could be—
4401,XVI.,"Nay, do nor blush nor turn that face away."
4402,XVI.,"You dream, aha, that I want sunset?—what?—"
4403,XVI.,"The colors come right pretty, but—there, there—"
4404,XVI.,
4405,XVI.,"“What say?—I ‘dare not face’ you now?—Those eyes,"
4406,XVI.,"Too bright, are they? or loving? Love, like God,"
4407,XVI.,"So brightly dear is it, that lives like ours,"
4408,XVI.,"Poor vapory lives, mere dews before the dawn,"
4409,XVI.,Dare not to face it lest we melt away?—
4410,XVI.,"Then be it so. Then look, Pauline, I dare"
4411,XVI.,Am I not yours? Should you not use your own?—
4412,XVI.,"Ay, darling, draw me all within yourself.”"
4413,XVI.,
4414,XVI.,
4415,XVII.,XVII.
4416,XVII.,
4417,XVII.,"Then, while he spoke with hands there clasping mine,"
4418,XVII.,And eyes that tired mine own with so much light
4419,XVII.,"Their trembling lids were vext by feeble tears,"
4420,XVII.,Doretta came.
4421,XVII.,"But startled, seeing me,"
4422,XVII.,"She only smiled; said: “Haydn, what! awake?—"
4423,XVII.,"And you, Pauline?—You good have been, so good;"
4424,XVII.,Nor call’d me; no. How very kind in you!
4425,XVII.,"Why, after all, some little training thus"
4426,XVII.,"Might make you like, perhaps, to be a nurse,—"
4427,XVII.,"Or housekeeper.—To-day, how wreck’d it look’d,"
4428,XVII.,Your room! Our father just now came from there;
4429,XVII.,"So vex’d, you know.”"
4430,XVII.,"I flush’d, and thought, at least,"
4431,XVII.,That she to speak of it had not been kind.
4432,XVII.,"And could have told her so, but check’d the words,"
4433,XVII.,"And went my way; and sought my father first,"
4434,XVII.,"And told him what the cause had been, and then"
4435,XVII.,"I sought my room, and pray’d that I might know"
4436,XVII.,If it were well to tell my father too
4437,XVII.,Of Haydn’s love; or tell my own to Haydn;
4438,XVII.,"Or if he loved me, since my sister’s words."
4439,XVII.,"If only he could know my soul in truth,"
4440,XVII.,I felt that I could suffer all things then;
4441,XVII.,"Could die, if so the veil about my heart"
4442,XVII.,"Withdrawn could be, and show him how I loved."
4443,XVII.,"Alas, I did not know then, had not learn’d,"
4444,XVII.,That love may more endure than even death.
4445,XVII.,
4446,XVII.,
4447,XVIII.,XVIII.
4448,XVIII.,
4449,XVIII.,The sunset brought Doretta to my room;
4450,XVIII.,"And she began, and chided me, and said:"
4451,XVIII.,“How dared you talk! and what were Haydn’s words?—
4452,XVIII.,"He lay so ill, with fever high, so high."
4453,XVIII.,He could but rave. How dared you lead him on?
4454,XVIII.,"He worse may grow,—Who knows, Pauline?—may die;"
4455,XVIII.,And all the cause may be your nursing him!—
4456,XVIII.,When will you learn to learn what you know not?”
4457,XVIII.,
4458,XVIII.,
4459,XIX.,XIX.
4460,XIX.,
4461,XIX.,"And then she told me such a long, sad tale,"
4462,XIX.,Of how great store she placed upon his life;
4463,XIX.,And how they two had thought the self-same thing:
4464,XIX.,"She knew each inner chamber in his heart,"
4465,XIX.,And what key could unlock it; and she named
4466,XIX.,"First one and then another of our friends,"
4467,XIX.,Whom she could never love as him she loved.
4468,XIX.,"Then sigh’d she: “Ah, Pauline, had you explored"
4469,XIX.,"The world about, with all its barren wastes,"
4470,XIX.,And found one little nook; and had you work’d
4471,XIX.,"And till’d it well, and form’d a garden there;"
4472,XIX.,And had you watch’d the plantlets grow until
4473,XIX.,"Their dainty bowers bent over you with shade,"
4474,XIX.,"All sweet with bursting buds and carolling birds,"
4475,XIX.,What could you think of one who came and stript
4476,XIX.,"Your life of this, the thing that so you prized?—"
4477,XIX.,"Alas, and what could I,—if any power"
4478,XIX.,"Should wrest from me my Haydn, all that soil"
4479,XIX.,"Where spring all hopes that bless my lonely hours,"
4480,XIX.,"And make it sweet for me to live my life,—"
4481,XIX.,"What could I think of her? Though you, Pauline,"
4482,XIX.,You have not known and tired of many men.
4483,XIX.,"You have not search’d, as I have, through the world”—"
4484,XIX.,
4485,XIX.,"“Nay, sister, I have not,” I said."
4486,XIX.,Then she—
4487,XIX.,"“Quite right: and cannot yet know love, true love."
4488,XIX.,"Kept close at school you were, and hard it was;"
4489,XIX.,"And harder still to-day that you must wait,"
4490,XIX.,"As I have done,—at your age too. But yet"
4491,XIX.,Right love is ripe love. Life must be exposed
4492,XIX.,In sun and storm—to frost and bruising too:
4493,XIX.,The fruit grows mellow by and by alone.”
4494,XIX.,
4495,XIX.,"“Why, dear,” said I, “I think that I can love!"
4496,XIX.,"You know what Haydn sings,—that maids, like flowers,"
4497,XIX.,"Are sweetest, pluck’d when in the bud?”"
4498,XIX.,"“There now,"
4499,XIX.,"You always will be quoting him!” she cried,—"
4500,XIX.,"“Because, forsooth, a man, your first man-friend!"
4501,XIX.,"Yet, not compared by you with other men,"
4502,XIX.,"How know you him, what sort of man he is?—"
4503,XIX.,Girls unsophisticated are like bees:
4504,XIX.,"They buzz for all, and yet sip all their sweets"
4505,XIX.,From the first flowery lips that open to them.”
4506,XIX.,
4507,XIX.,
4508,XX.,XX.
4509,XX.,
4510,XX.,"“Nay,” answer’d I, “I like him not for that,—"
4511,XX.,Because a man!”
4512,XX.,“What?—not for that?” she said:
4513,XX.,"“Aha, have shrewder plans?—I know, I know"
4514,XX.,"It would be well if you, or I, could feel"
4515,XX.,That all were settled for our wedded life;
4516,XX.,"So many ifs and ifs, it vexes one;"
4517,XX.,"It would be better, were we done with them."
4518,XX.,"But we, poor girls, too trusting natures have."
4519,XX.,"Weak parasites at best, each tall stout man"
4520,XX.,Seems just the thing that we should cling about.
4521,XX.,"But, dear, I think that half these trunks give way:—"
4522,XX.,The wonder is we dare to cling at all!”
4523,XX.,
4524,XX.,"“But Haydn,” said I, “Haydn”—"
4525,XX.,"“As for him,”"
4526,XX.,"She sigh’d, “may be he is not trustless all;"
4527,XX.,"Yet if he be, or be not, how know you"
4528,XX.,"Who know not human nature, nor have learn’d"
4529,XX.,"The way to work it, and bring out its worth?"
4530,XX.,A friend grows grain and chaff. Sift out the first
4531,XX.,"And cultivate it well, some gain may come—"
4532,XX.,Some profit from your friendship.”
4533,XX.,"“But,” said I,"
4534,XX.,"“If you should change yourself who change your friend,"
4535,XX.,"Or change but his relations to yourself,"
4536,XX.,"Or, some way, make a new, strange man of him?”—"
4537,XX.,
4538,XX.,"“Then would I make,” she said, “what pleases me;"
4539,XX.,And with what pleases me preserve my love.”
4540,XX.,
4541,XX.,
4542,XXI.,XXI.
4543,XXI.,
4544,XXI.,"“And I,” replied I, “not for future gain,"
4545,XXI.,"For what he may become, would prize my friend;"
4546,XXI.,I prize the thing he is; nor wish him changed.
4547,XXI.,I would not dare disturb for aught besides
4548,XXI.,"The poise of traits composing sympathy,"
4549,XXI.,"Which, as they are, so balance my desires."
4550,XXI.,"Ah, did I chiefly look for gain to come,"
4551,XXI.,"For him or me, where were my present joy?—"
4552,XXI.,"Nay, nay, that love I, which I find possess’d.”"
4553,XXI.,
4554,XXI.,"“Pray, how much can you find possess’d?” she ask’d."
4555,XXI.,
4556,XXI.,"“Enough to love,” I said."
4557,XXI.,“What holds enough
4558,XXI.,For that?” she laugh’d.
4559,XXI.,"“Enough,” I answer’d her,—"
4560,XXI.,“To make his presence here a boon to me;
4561,XXI.,To make his wishes a behest for me;
4562,XXI.,"To make me feel an instinct seeking him,"
4563,XXI.,"And, finding him, a consciousness of all.”"
4564,XXI.,
4565,XXI.,"“‘A consciousness of all,’ is vague,” she said."
4566,XXI.,“I ask for reasons and you rave alone.
4567,XXI.,"This very vagueness, while you answer me,"
4568,XXI.,"Proves all your love a myth, or immature.”"
4569,XXI.,
4570,XXI.,"“Ah, dear,” replied I, “there is higher love,—"
4571,XXI.,"A love of God, a love all worshipful;"
4572,XXI.,"And that love should you ask me to define,"
4573,XXI.,I might an answer vaguer still give back:
4574,XXI.,The finite only can be well defined.”
4575,XXI.,
4576,XXI.,“The finite!” she repeated; then exclaim’d:
4577,XXI.,"“Oh, you wish worship! We must find you then"
4578,XXI.,An idol! and I know a golden one;
4579,XXI.,"And so do you—nay, nay, deny it not.—"
4580,XXI.,And father’s heart is fix’d on him; besides
4581,XXI.,Your lover could fall down and worship you;
4582,XXI.,"So father says. Two idols you could have,—"
4583,XXI.,"Your home a very temple; only, dear,"
4584,XXI.,Be not so backward. Had but I your chance—
4585,XXI.,To you our suitors all present their best.
4586,XXI.,You get the diamonds as if you were noon;
4587,XXI.,"While I, I get but coals. They never touch,"
4588,XXI.,Unless to burn or else to blacken me.”
4589,XXI.,
4590,XXI.,
4591,XXII.,XXII.
4592,XXII.,
4593,XXII.,"She spoke, then left abruptly. Strange it was,"
4594,XXII.,With what abhorrence I would shrink from her
4595,XXII.,"While speaking thus. Not selfish seem’d she all,"
4596,XXII.,"But so insensible; and these, our tastes,"
4597,XXII.,"These dainty despots of desire, our tastes"
4598,XXII.,The worst of tyrants are; nor brook offense.
4599,XXII.,"I wellnigh hated her. Yet minded thus,"
4600,XXII.,While musing on her moods that seemed so hard—
4601,XXII.,"Have not you noticed at the arsenal,"
4602,XXII.,"At times, when watching those grim helmets there,"
4603,XXII.,"All suddenly, upon their polish’d brass"
4604,XXII.,"A wondrous brightness? then, within the disk,"
4605,XXII.,Your own face hideous render’d? So with me:
4606,XXII.,"Amid her harsher traits that there appear’d,"
4607,XXII.,"Shone soon the brighter metal; out of it,"
4608,XXII.,Leer’d back to greet me my own hideousness!—
4609,XXII.,"For I, it seem’d, had been the selfish one."
4610,XXII.,"Had I regarded her, my father’s wish,"
4611,XXII.,"That suitor’s choice?—Nay, I had thought of none,"
4612,XXII.,None saving Haydn.
4613,XXII.,"Then I ask’d again,"
4614,XXII.,"Could this be true—the thing my sister said,—"
4615,XXII.,Could aught so sweet as Haydn’s love exude
4616,XXII.,"From moods, all mushroom’d by disease? I thought"
4617,XXII.,How marvellously throng’d with strange weird shapes
4618,XXII.,"Deep halls of fancy loom, when lighted up"
4619,XXII.,"By fires of fever; how, with trust complete,"
4620,XXII.,"The weak lean oft on all beside themselves,"
4621,XXII.,And soon I blamed my heart that it could dare
4622,XXII.,"To lure his poor, weak, crazed confession on;"
4623,XXII.,"And then I flush’d, and broke in passionate sobs,"
4624,XXII.,To think Doretta dared to hint such things.
4625,XXII.,
4626,XXII.,
4627,XXIII.,XXIII.
4628,XXIII.,
4629,XXIII.,"Three days my woes alternated, and then"
4630,XXIII.,I went to my confessor for relief.
4631,XXIII.,
4632,XXIII.,"“What, child,” he said, “love troubles you again?"
4633,XXIII.,"The rest of us poor mortals here, we fret"
4634,XXIII.,"Because we have too little of it, you"
4635,XXIII.,"Because you have too much. All girls are prone,"
4636,XXIII.,"Young girls, to deem their own love great and grand;"
4637,XXIII.,"But you, my child, find yours a very monster!"
4638,XXIII.,It taxes all your powers to get it food;
4639,XXIII.,Yet nothing does unless to tramp on you.
4640,XXIII.,"Now tell me, think you God it is, or man,"
4641,XXIII.,Who makes our earthly love so troublesome?”
4642,XXIII.,
4643,XXIII.,"“Why, man,” I said, “of course.”"
4644,XXIII.,"“Of course,” he said;"
4645,XXIII.,“Then think you not it might be wise to get
4646,XXIII.,"Some less of man in you, and more of God?—"
4647,XXIII.,How fares it with your prayers?”
4648,XXIII.,"“But yet,” I urged,"
4649,XXIII.,"“It scarcely seems my fault, this woe of mine.”"
4650,XXIII.,
4651,XXIII.,“Seems not your fault?” he answer’d; “weigh the sides:
4652,XXIII.,One for you—three against you—which should
4653,XXIII.,yield?”
4654,XXIII.,
4655,XXIII.,"“No; two for me,” I said,—“myself and Haydn;"
4656,XXIII.,"Besides, the other three have no such love.”"
4657,XXIII.,
4658,XXIII.,“No love?” he said. “Is that a Christian mood?
4659,XXIII.,"A modest, humble mood?—‘Have no such love’?"
4660,XXIII.,"How test we love, my child? It seems to me"
4661,XXIII.,"That love, like light, is tested by its rays."
4662,XXIII.,"The halo crowns the saints, our lights of life,"
4663,XXIII.,Just as the love they shed surrounds their souls.
4664,XXIII.,"Where one is God’s, the strong soul serves the weak;"
4665,XXIII.,The mother yields her powers to bless her babes;
4666,XXIII.,"The man his powers, for her; and Christ for all."
4667,XXIII.,"Ah, child, if you were strong! had love like theirs!”"
4668,XXIII.,
4669,XXIII.,"I sigh’d, “But how can one know whom to serve?”"
4670,XXIII.,
4671,XXIII.,“How?—Put it thus:—your own wish? or your father’s?—
4672,XXIII.,How reads the decalogue?”
4673,XXIII.,"“But,” answer’d I,"
4674,XXIII.,“It seems as if some higher power there were
4675,XXIII.,That first should be obey’d—some power like God.”
4676,XXIII.,
4677,XXIII.,"“Yes, child,” he said, “there is, of course, the Church:"
4678,XXIII.,"Of course, of course.”"
4679,XXIII.,“Who is the Church?” I ask’d.
4680,XXIII.,"And then he laugh’d: “Who?—What a question, child!—"
4681,XXIII.,"Why, read your prayer-book. Why, of course, the Church,"
4682,XXIII.,Speaks through its ministers.”
4683,XXIII.,"“If you speak then,”"
4684,XXIII.,"Inquired I, trembling,—“give advice to us,"
4685,XXIII.,Is that the last resort?—must one obey?”
4686,XXIII.,
4687,XXIII.,"“Why, that depends,” he said;—“but, dear me, child,"
4688,XXIII.,You must not think us bears! We growl at times
4689,XXIII.,"In sermons, eh?—But then, dear me, dear me,"
4690,XXIII.,"We would not eat our flock up, little lamb!—"
4691,XXIII.,"But come,” he added, “come; enough of this;"
4692,XXIII.,How fares it with your prayers?”
4693,XXIII.,
4694,XXIII.,
4695,XXIV.,XXIV.
4696,XXIV.,
4697,XXIV.,"Soon after that,"
4698,XXIV.,"One day, while troubled much, I met by chance,"
4699,XXIV.,"My Haydn, half restored, outside his room."
4700,XXIV.,"For once, he sat alone; and, seeing me,—"
4701,XXIV.,
4702,XXIV.,"“Why, friend, what accident is this?” he ask’d."
4703,XXIV.,"“In tears, too, tears?—Tell now, what sullen storm"
4704,XXIV.,Has left such heavy drops? Did it not know
4705,XXIV.,"That these too tender lids might droop? if droop,"
4706,XXIV.,What rare views they might close to some one here?—
4707,XXIV.,What can have happen’d?
4708,XXIV.,
4709,XXIV.,“Why not speak to me?—
4710,XXIV.,You seem the very statue of yourself.—
4711,XXIV.,"Why, what has chill’d you so?—Not I?—Not I?—"
4712,XXIV.,"Pauline, I know, if I to you were cold,"
4713,XXIV.,A certain rosy face with opening lips
4714,XXIV.,"Could come with power to bring me summer air,"
4715,XXIV.,"Dispelling sweetly my most wintry wish,"
4716,XXIV.,Despite myself!—Why will you trust me not?”
4717,XXIV.,
4718,XXIV.,And then I spoke to him. I hinted first
4719,XXIV.,My moods were odd; not moods for him to mind.
4720,XXIV.,
4721,XXIV.,"“Odd,” answer’d he; “I knew a family"
4722,XXIV.,"Where all the children grew so very odd,—"
4723,XXIV.,Like fruit when tough to touch and sour to taste.
4724,XXIV.,"Not ripe nor mellow. Too much spring had they,"
4725,XXIV.,And not enough of summer in their home.—
4726,XXIV.,I know that you are not so very odd
4727,XXIV.,That you would keep apart from one you love.
4728,XXIV.,"And I, can I not hope that I am one?”"
4729,XXIV.,
4730,XXIV.,
4731,XXV.,XXV.
4732,XXV.,
4733,XXV.,At these words then (how could I help myself?)
4734,XXV.,"My heart-gates flew wide open; emptied all,—"
4735,XXV.,The whole the priest had told me of my sin;
4736,XXV.,And how we should not talk together more.
4737,XXV.,
4738,XXV.,How wild it made him! Never had I seen
4739,XXV.,One shaken so. His anger frighten’d me.
4740,XXV.,"“This crafty priest,” he said, “you ask’d of God:"
4741,XXV.,"He answer’d you about the Church, ‘of course.’"
4742,XXV.,"And of the Church about the priests, ‘of course,’"
4743,XXV.,"And of the priests about himself, ‘of course.’"
4744,XXV.,I tell you this is cursèd selfishness;
4745,XXV.,I tell you it is downright sacrilege!—
4746,XXV.,To strain the oceans of the Infinite
4747,XXV.,"Down through that sieve, man’s windpipe, wheezing out,"
4748,XXV.,"‘I deal the voice of God, I, I, the priest.’”"
4749,XXV.,
4750,XXV.,"“O Haydn,” said I, “How—how can you dare?”"
4751,XXV.,
4752,XXV.,"“How dare?” he cried out, “dare? Am I a dog,"
4753,XXV.,"A dog or woman cringing to a man,"
4754,XXV.,Because of kicks or curses?”
4755,XXV.,"“Nay,” I sobb’d,"
4756,XXV.,"“I kneel before his office, not to him.”"
4757,XXV.,
4758,XXV.,"“Poor girl,” he said, “forgive me—stop—I beg—"
4759,XXV.,What? can you think that I would make you weep?
4760,XXV.,"Not, darling, not of you, I meant to speak,"
4761,XXV.,But of the system.”
4762,XXV.,"“System,” I replied;"
4763,XXV.,"“Why, Haydn, are you not a Christian, then?”"
4764,XXV.,
4765,XXV.,“And wherefore not?” he ask’d.
4766,XXV.,"“Because,” I said,"
4767,XXV.,“You speak so of the Church.”
4768,XXV.,"“But I,” said he,"
4769,XXV.,"“Was arguing not of that, but of the priest.”"
4770,XXV.,
4771,XXV.,"“And he has been ordain’d,” I said: “And you,"
4772,XXV.,You reverence not the ministers of God?”
4773,XXV.,
4774,XXV.,"“Of God,” he mutter’d,—“yes, when that they are."
4775,XXV.,I reverence the princeship; not the prince
4776,XXV.,"Who doffs his regal robes, and leaves his throne,"
4777,XXV.,And lowers his aims and slaves it with mere serfs.”
4778,XXV.,
4779,XXV.,
4780,XXVI.,XXVI.
4781,XXVI.,
4782,XXVI.,“What can you mean?” I ask’d.
4783,XXVI.,“I mean that priests
4784,XXVI.,Are not ordain’d for work in every sphere.
4785,XXVI.,"A prince dispenses, does not mine, his gold."
4786,XXVI.,A priest administers the truth reveal’d;
4787,XXVI.,"What power has he to delve divine designs,"
4788,XXVI.,"Or minister dictation, in the spheres"
4789,XXVI.,"Where God, to train our reason, leaves us free?"
4790,XXVI.,"Your priest who tampers with our home-life here,—"
4791,XXVI.,"What warrant holds he, human or divine?"
4792,XXVI.,"Whatever move him—if he serve your father,"
4793,XXVI.,"Or deem that gifts like those he fancies mine,"
4794,XXVI.,"May worthier prove, devoted to the Church,"
4795,XXVI.,Is he in this our final arbiter?—
4796,XXVI.,Have I no judgment?—are not you of age?
4797,XXVI.,"Pauline, but heed me; let no power, I beg,"
4798,XXVI.,Succeed in sundering us. Heaven hears my words
4799,XXVI.,"I fear some plot may crush, or make your soul"
4800,XXVI.,(God save you if you yield) a mere bent truck
4801,XXVI.,To bear some weight of meanness on to ill.”
4802,XXVI.,
4803,XXVI.,"“But I,” I said, “had ask’d the priest’s advice.”"
4804,XXVI.,
4805,XXVI.,"“He handled ill th’ occasion,” answer’d he."
4806,XXVI.,“I would not dare to mould another thus.
4807,XXVI.,"Nay, though I knew that I could model thence"
4808,XXVI.,The best-form’d manhood of my mind’s ideal.
4809,XXVI.,"Who knows?—My own ideal, my wisest aim,"
4810,XXVI.,"May tempt myself, and others, too, astray."
4811,XXVI.,"If I be made one soul to answer for,"
4812,XXVI.,"And make myself responsible for two,"
4813,XXVI.,"I may be doubly damn’d. How impious,—"
4814,XXVI.,The will that thus would manage other wills;
4815,XXVI.,"As though we men were puppets of a show,"
4816,XXVI.,"Not spirits, restless and irresolute,"
4817,XXVI.,Poised on a point between the right and wrong
4818,XXVI.,From which a breath may launch for heaven or hell!—
4819,XXVI.,You dare submit to this impiety?”
4820,XXVI.,
4821,XXVI.,"“But, Haydn,” said I, “you, too, heed advice.”"
4822,XXVI.,
4823,XXVI.,“Advice?” he answer’d. “What?—is this the ground
4824,XXVI.,"On which these base authority?—Nay, nay,"
4825,XXVI.,"Base where they may, their ground is wilfulness,"
4826,XXVI.,"Years back invested; not disrobed, because"
4827,XXVI.,"Old forms are reverenced.—Yes, but are they right?"
4828,XXVI.,Think you God gives to strength of will the right
4829,XXVI.,"To say what is right? And if not, what then?"
4830,XXVI.,"If one obey then, how can he be sure"
4831,XXVI.,That he obeys not sin?”
4832,XXVI.,"“They may have will,”"
4833,XXVI.,"I said, “but you forget; the priests are wise.”"
4834,XXVI.,
4835,XXVI.,“About what life?” he cried. “In every path
4836,XXVI.,Experience is the warrant for advice.
4837,XXVI.,But life for them—what know they real of life?—
4838,XXVI.,"Naught, naught; and if they give you their advice"
4839,XXVI.,"They give you naught, or else they give you whims;—"
4840,XXVI.,A bachelor teaching dames about their babes!
4841,XXVI.,Or matrons how to guide their grown-up girls!
4842,XXVI.,"Alas, their counsels ignorant, partial, false,"
4843,XXVI.,Repel toward infidelity the wise;
4844,XXVI.,And half of those they hope will follow them
4845,XXVI.,Make hypocrites or hypochondriacs.”
4846,XXVI.,
4847,XXVI.,
4848,XXVII.,XXVII.
4849,XXVII.,
4850,XXVII.,What could I say? I rose to leave him then.
4851,XXVII.,
4852,XXVII.,“And have they really separated us?”
4853,XXVII.,He ask’d.
4854,XXVII.,"And I, “What mean you?”"
4855,XXVII.,“Are you then
4856,XXVII.,"My friend or not?” he went on, mournfully."
4857,XXVII.,
4858,XXVII.,“What is a friend?” I ask’d.
4859,XXVII.,"“What else,” he said,"
4860,XXVII.,"“But, in a world, where all misjudge one so,"
4861,XXVII.,A soul to whom one dares to speak the truth?”
4862,XXVII.,
4863,XXVII.,"“Ah, Haydn,” ask’d I, “must we speak all truth?”"
4864,XXVII.,
4865,XXVII.,"“Why not?” he said, “is ill less ill when hid?—"
4866,XXVII.,"Is not the penitent a sinner frank,"
4867,XXVII.,The hypocrite a sinner not so frank?”—
4868,XXVII.,
4869,XXVII.,"“But yet,” protested I, “the truth may harm.”"
4870,XXVII.,
4871,XXVII.,"“How so?” he ask’d. “If one show naked sin,—"
4872,XXVII.,Who knows?—it then may shame men from the sin.
4873,XXVII.,And could the naked good accomplish more?
4874,XXVII.,Must not we Christians here confess our faults?
4875,XXVII.,Why should we not? Has wrong such lovely smiles
4876,XXVII.,"And loving tones, that men should long for it?"
4877,XXVII.,The harm is in the lie that masks the sin.”
4878,XXVII.,
4879,XXVII.,"“And yet,” I said, “the young—the prejudiced”—"
4880,XXVII.,
4881,XXVII.,"“For their sake,” said he, “wisdom may be wise"
4882,XXVII.,In what it screens from folly.—Yet you know
4883,XXVII.,"The crime of Socrates,—‘corrupting youth’?"
4884,XXVII.,"The tale is old; this lying world wants liars,"
4885,XXVII.,But what of that? The Christs lie not: they die.
4886,XXVII.,Our God is great. I deem Him great enough
4887,XXVII.,His truth to save without subverting ours.
4888,XXVII.,True sovereignty has truth: ’tis not a sham
4889,XXVII.,"That holds high rank because we courteous men,"
4890,XXVII.,"Considerate men, allow it seeming rank."
4891,XXVII.,"Who lies to save the truth, distrusts the truth,"
4892,XXVII.,"Disowns the soul, and does despite to God."
4893,XXVII.,"Who strives to save his life thus, loses it,"
4894,XXVII.,"In evil trusting and the Evil One,—"
4895,XXVII.,"Salvation through the Devil, not through Christ!”"
4896,XXVII.,
4897,XXVII.,
4898,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
4899,XXVIII.,
4900,XXVIII.,"Then while he sat there, with his flushing cheeks,"
4901,XXVIII.,"Himself defending thus,—I, charm’d the while,—"
4902,XXVIII.,"The door flew open, and behind it stood"
4903,XXVIII.,My father and the priest.
4904,XXVIII.,Then had they said
4905,XXVIII.,"But one harsh word, it had not been so sad."
4906,XXVIII.,"But kind they were, too kind. Ah, sister dear,"
4907,XXVIII.,"Have you not felt how much more pain it gives,"
4908,XXVIII.,This pain from kindness? Love is like the sun:
4909,XXVIII.,"It brightens life, but yet may parch it too."
4910,XXVIII.,"And wind may blow, and man may screen himself;"
4911,XXVIII.,"And rain may fall, and he may shelter find;"
4912,XXVIII.,"And frost may chill, and he may clothing wear;"
4913,XXVIII.,"But what can ward off sun-stroke?—Love,"
4914,XXVIII.,Its first degree may bring fertility;
4915,XXVIII.,Its next one barrenness. It lights; it blights.
4916,XXVIII.,"The flames of heaven, flash’d far and spent, turn smoke"
4917,XXVIII.,To glut the gloom of hell.
4918,XXVIII.,
4919,XXVIII.,Words kind as these
4920,XXVIII.,(We could have braced ourselves against them else)
4921,XXVIII.,"Threw wide, like spells, each passage to our hearts"
4922,XXVIII.,That caution should have guarded. “We knew not
4923,XXVIII.,"Our own minds, poor young pair,” they said. “At least,"
4924,XXVIII.,"Our love could wait: meantime, whose love could claim"
4925,XXVIII.,"Our trust, like theirs whose treasure lay in us?”"
4926,XXVIII.,
4927,XXVIII.,
4928,XXIX.,XXIX.
4929,XXIX.,
4930,XXIX.,And then to me alone they spoke of Haydn:—
4931,XXIX.,“He passionate had been:—how knew I when
4932,XXIX.,His passion might be turn’d against myself?
4933,XXIX.,"And he had sinn’d, so sorely, sorely sinn’d:—"
4934,XXIX.,How could one thus defame the Church and priest?
4935,XXIX.,"And did my love for him suggest such words,"
4936,XXIX.,"Or should my love hereafter sanction them,"
4937,XXIX.,"Might not his wrong prove mine?—If I should yield,"
4938,XXIX.,"Be won by his unbridled words, might not"
4939,XXIX.,My act confirm his trust in thought uncheck’d?
4940,XXIX.,"And thought uncheck’d,—it oft more danger fronts"
4941,XXIX.,"Than does the uncheck’d steed, whose frenzied flight"
4942,XXIX.,"Defies the rein, and, dashing down a road"
4943,XXIX.,"Straight deathward, trails his luckless driver on,"
4944,XXIX.,Whirl’d powerless to prevent all as a babe.”
4945,XXIX.,
4946,XXIX.,I spake of Haydn’s love.
4947,XXIX.,They bade me think
4948,XXIX.,"“How often love that loses earthly friends,"
4949,XXIX.,Comes back from all things outward toward itself;
4950,XXIX.,"And finding self, finds heaven’s design within?"
4951,XXIX.,Did not I know that loss and gain are both
4952,XXIX.,Sent here to aid the worth of inner traits
4953,XXIX.,And change the phases of the spirit’s growth?—
4954,XXIX.,Each passing season circling round a tree
4955,XXIX.,"Leaves, clasping it, a ring; the rings remain,"
4956,XXIX.,So seasons past remain about the soul:
4957,XXIX.,And men can trace its former life far less
4958,XXIX.,"By tales the tongue may tell, than by the range"
4959,XXIX.,"And reach of that which circumscribes the mood,"
4960,XXIX.,Including or excluding right or wrong.”
4961,XXIX.,
4962,XXIX.,
4963,XXX.,XXX.
4964,XXX.,
4965,XXX.,And then they added: “Might it not be found
4966,XXX.,That loss of my love was the very means
4967,XXX.,Design’d by Providence for Haydn’s good?”
4968,XXX.,
4969,XXX.,To this I could but answer that “his love
4970,XXX.,"Seem’d Providential too, a holy thing.”"
4971,XXX.,
4972,XXX.,"They only frown’d, and said: “The Prince of Ill"
4973,XXX.,Came oft robed like an angel of the light;—
4974,XXX.,"Why not like love?—The only holy thing,"
4975,XXX.,"Such proven to be, was Christ. And what of Him"
4976,XXX.,When moved by love?—of His great sacrifice!—
4977,XXX.,"And did I really prize this Haydn so,"
4978,XXX.,Would love prompt naught in me!”
4979,XXX.,"And thus they talk’d,"
4980,XXX.,"Till, welcoming doubt, my faith succumb’d to it;"
4981,XXX.,"And all the love once making me so proud,"
4982,XXX.,"Whose growth, I thought, would be so sweet and fair,"
4983,XXX.,Stung like a very thistle in my soul;
4984,XXX.,"Each breath of theirs would blow its prickles keen,"
4985,XXX.,And sow its pestering seedlets far and wide
4986,XXX.,O’er every pleasing prospect of my life.
4987,XXX.,
4988,XXX.,
4989,XXXI.,XXXI.
4990,XXXI.,
4991,XXXI.,"And I recall my calling out in prayer,"
4992,XXXI.,"How long, how toilfully, how fruitlessly!"
4993,XXXI.,"At last, my doubt had made me leave my beads,"
4994,XXXI.,"And, moved as if to cool a feverish faith,"
4995,XXXI.,"Pass out, the night air seeking. There I saw"
4996,XXXI.,"The moon. It soothed me always with strange spells,"
4997,XXXI.,"The moon. But now, as though all things would join"
4998,XXXI.,"To rout my peace, I seem’d this moon to see"
4999,XXXI.,"Caught up behind an angry horde of clouds,"
5000,XXXI.,Chased by the hot breath of a coming storm
5001,XXXI.,That clang’d his thunder-bugle through the west.
5002,XXXI.,"When once the rude gust hit the moon, it tipt—"
5003,XXXI.,Or so it seem’d—and with a deafening peal
5004,XXXI.,"It spilt one blinding flash. Then, where this lit,"
5005,XXXI.,Just in the path before me gleam’d a knife!
5006,XXXI.,Held o’er a form of white! To see the thing
5007,XXXI.,I scream’d aloud. It seem’d a ghost!
5008,XXXI.,My scream
5009,XXXI.,Awoke no echo save Doretta’s voice:—
5010,XXXI.,“Pauline?—and were you frighten’d?”
5011,XXXI.,"Then to this,"
5012,XXXI.,"In part because the shock had stunn’d me much,"
5013,XXXI.,"In part because I felt me much provoked,"
5014,XXXI.,"But most because my ears were deaf to sport,"
5015,XXXI.,"I answer’d naught. Whereat, as now I think,"
5016,XXXI.,"Though then in that unnatural, nervous mood"
5017,XXXI.,"My mind surmised more horrid inference,"
5018,XXXI.,"Her voice, in still more mischievous caprice,"
5019,XXXI.,Went on to vex me more.
5020,XXXI.,“What?—Fear you me!
5021,XXXI.,"And have you done so much against me, then!"
5022,XXXI.,"And if you have, why fear you here a knife?—"
5023,XXXI.,You think the blade might draw some little blood;—
5024,XXXI.,Would that much signify?—the body pain’d?
5025,XXXI.,Suppose that one should wield some subtler blade
5026,XXXI.,"And draw some tears, mere watery tears, weak things;—"
5027,XXXI.,Would they much signify?—a soul in pain?
5028,XXXI.,And did you never now do that?—draw tears?—
5029,XXXI.,"And think, is not the soul much worse to harm"
5030,XXXI.,Than is the body?—Fy! why fear a knife?
5031,XXXI.,If I supposed that through a lifetime long
5032,XXXI.,"My soul should bleed its dear strength out in tears,"
5033,XXXI.,Why would it not be mercy to myself
5034,XXXI.,"For me to check the longer, stronger woe"
5035,XXXI.,"By shedding here some drops of weaker blood,"
5036,XXXI.,"Now, once for all?”"
5037,XXXI.,"“O dear Doretta mine,”"
5038,XXXI.,"I cried, and still more anxious, “do you mean”—"
5039,XXXI.,
5040,XXXI.,"“This,” answer’d she; “I mean that I would cut"
5041,XXXI.,"My body’s life in two parts, rather than"
5042,XXXI.,My soul’s life.”
5043,XXXI.,"“Sister,” I could only gasp,"
5044,XXXI.,“Cease—do;—put by that knife”—
5045,XXXI.,“Why?” answer’d she;—
5046,XXXI.,“For what?—Your wish? Do you so often yield
5047,XXXI.,When I wish aught?—Say now what would you give?”
5048,XXXI.,
5049,XXXI.,“Give?—Any thing!” I answer’d.
5050,XXXI.,"“Be not rash,”"
5051,XXXI.,"Came then. “It scarcely seems your way; besides,"
5052,XXXI.,The light is dim. How know you? may not ears
5053,XXXI.,Not far off overhear us here? Beware!—
5054,XXXI.,"But stay!” she added, “I will go my way,"
5055,XXXI.,And you go yours. Who cares what either does?”
5056,XXXI.,
5057,XXXI.,
5058,XXXII.,XXXII.
5059,XXXII.,
5060,XXXII.,"“Doretta, nay; but stop,” I cried again,"
5061,XXXII.,"“Put by the knife!—and if you will, then I—"
5062,XXXII.,Then I and Haydn will not”—
5063,XXXII.,"“You?” she laugh’d,"
5064,XXXII.,“And Haydn?—Humph!—Who cares what you may do?—
5065,XXXII.,"But ah—if planning thus to vent your thought,"
5066,XXXII.,"Could I have chosen, eh, a shrewder way?—"
5067,XXXII.,"Ha! ha!—to murder me, or you, or him!"
5068,XXXII.,"It starts all madness, yes, to tap your moods."
5069,XXXII.,"But go in, simpleton,—the rain has come,—"
5070,XXXII.,And trust the knife to me. It meant no harm
5071,XXXII.,Except to this beheaded cabbage here.”
5072,XXXII.,
5073,XXXII.,"And, shaking this aloft, she flitted off,"
5074,XXXII.,"While I walk’d vaguely back, to find my room"
5075,XXXII.,Still sadder than before. I could not think
5076,XXXII.,That my surmise was just; yet could not think
5077,XXXII.,That all her strange demean was meaningless;
5078,XXXII.,"To this day yet, I pause and puzzle oft"
5079,XXXII.,"That scene to ponder; then, to moods confused,"
5080,XXXII.,"It seem’d the final blow, unsettling all."
5081,XXXII.,
5082,XXXII.,
5083,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
5084,XXXIII.,
5085,XXXIII.,What comes as direful as the direful night
5086,XXXIII.,A spirit spends in trouble?—fill’d with fears
5087,XXXIII.,That sleep may bring distressful nightmares now;
5088,XXXIII.,"And now, that morn may come before we sleep;"
5089,XXXIII.,"Until, betwixt the two, distracted quite,"
5090,XXXIII.,"Awake one dreams, and dreaming seems awake,"
5091,XXXIII.,"And evermore does weep at what he dreams,"
5092,XXXIII.,And then does weep that he should dream no more.
5093,XXXIII.,"In darkest fancies all that night I lay,"
5094,XXXIII.,"A murderess, guilty of Doretta’s death."
5095,XXXIII.,
5096,XXXIII.,
5097,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
5098,XXXIV.,
5099,XXXIV.,"Alas! and after those long hours of woe,"
5100,XXXIV.,More woe awaited me when morning came.
5101,XXXIV.,"Our Haydn’s bed-worn frame, so frail before,"
5102,XXXIV.,"New-rent by throes of passion yesterday,"
5103,XXXIV.,Once more lay prostrate in the arms of death:
5104,XXXIV.,"So thought we all: I, ere the fact I heard,"
5105,XXXIV.,Could feel its cold shade creeping over me.
5106,XXXIV.,"The shutters closed, the silence everywhere,"
5107,XXXIV.,"The very coffin of our lively home,"
5108,XXXIV.,"The sadden’d looks, the voices all suppress’d,"
5109,XXXIV.,"The kind physician’s face, that wore no smile,—"
5110,XXXIV.,I did not need to ask the cause of all.
5111,XXXIV.,I sought and saw my Haydn. How his face
5112,XXXIV.,"Gazed forth, a ghost’s, against my sense of guilt!"
5113,XXXIV.,"For I, perhaps, had made his last thought sin;"
5114,XXXIV.,"And I, perhaps, had lured him toward his doom."
5115,XXXIV.,"I thought then of my father, of the priest,"
5116,XXXIV.,"What they of love had said, of genuine love,"
5117,XXXIV.,Such love as Christ had had. I ask’d myself
5118,XXXIV.,If there was naught that I could sacrifice?
5119,XXXIV.,
5120,XXXIV.,
5121,XXXV.,XXXV.
5122,XXXV.,
5123,XXXV.,"Ah, friend, do you recall that afternoon"
5124,XXXV.,When first we met? How sad yet sweet it seem’d!
5125,XXXV.,"So many kindly sisters with me spake,"
5126,XXXV.,"And for me prayed, and when the dusk had come,"
5127,XXXV.,"And hardly any eye but God’s could see,"
5128,XXXV.,"We knelt before the altar; and I rose,"
5129,XXXV.,Content if like that light before the shrine
5130,XXXV.,Within my heart one light alone could burn;
5131,XXXV.,Though all the earth beside might loom as dark
5132,XXXV.,"As those chill, shadowy chapels down the aisle."
5133,XXXV.,
5134,XXXV.,I felt another life when walking home.
5135,XXXV.,"Such conflicts come but seldom; storms of spring,"
5136,XXXV.,"Uprooting much, and wracking much the soil,"
5137,XXXV.,"They find it frost-bound, and they leave it green."
5138,XXXV.,"Alas, if grain or chaff grow then, depends"
5139,XXXV.,Upon the germs their rains have wrought upon.
5140,XXXV.,
5141,XXXV.,
5142,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
5143,XXXVI.,
5144,XXXVI.,"When Haydn grew less ill, could talk once more,"
5145,XXXVI.,"And proved our prayers for him were not in vain,"
5146,XXXVI.,The kind physician urged that he and I
5147,XXXVI.,"Be kept no more apart. My father then,"
5148,XXXVI.,"At first, would not consent. I went to him."
5149,XXXVI.,"“My father,” said I, “do not fear for me."
5150,XXXVI.,If God will give our poor friend health once more
5151,XXXVI.,Then have I vow’d that never will I take
5152,XXXVI.,"A veil, save one that weds me to the Church.”"
5153,XXXVI.,
5154,XXXVI.,"“My daughter,—what?” he ask’d, “you never take—"
5155,XXXVI.,"Ay, what is this you say?—you wed the Church?—"
5156,XXXVI.,"In God’s name, child, explain yourself.”"
5157,XXXVI.,"“A vow,”"
5158,XXXVI.,"I said, “A vow that I have made the Virgin.”"
5159,XXXVI.,
5160,XXXVI.,"“What strange, what thoughtless deed is this?” he ask’d."
5161,XXXVI.,"“You take a vow, one not to be recall’d,"
5162,XXXVI.,"That you will thwart our hopes, our plans for you?—"
5163,XXXVI.,"And shut away, away from all of us,"
5164,XXXVI.,"This face, this form, so cherish’d all these years?—"
5165,XXXVI.,True?—Is it true?—I would not frighten you:
5166,XXXVI.,"Poor girl, God knows that you will have enough"
5167,XXXVI.,"To shudder for.—Yet, it bewilders me:"
5168,XXXVI.,"How could you, you who had been wont to be"
5169,XXXVI.,"So trustful and considerate and calm,"
5170,XXXVI.,"How could you do a thing so rash, so wrong,"
5171,XXXVI.,"Nor once consult me?—Tell me this, my child:"
5172,XXXVI.,What false inducement could have tempted you?”
5173,XXXVI.,
5174,XXXVI.,"“Woe me!” I sobb’d, “I marvell’d when you said"
5175,XXXVI.,"I could do so, the time I told you here"
5176,XXXVI.,That I would rather be a nun than be
5177,XXXVI.,That rich man’s wife.”
5178,XXXVI.,"“You dear, poor girl,” he sigh’d,"
5179,XXXVI.,"“Those words were but a whiff, whiff light as breath"
5180,XXXVI.,One blows at flies that come to trouble him.
5181,XXXVI.,And can it be that they?—I half believe
5182,XXXVI.,(My words have conjured cursèd deeds before)
5183,XXXVI.,"The very atoms of the air, like pools,"
5184,XXXVI.,"Hold spawn-strown vermin-eggs! If one but speak,"
5185,XXXVI.,But break the silence; if his breath but bear
5186,XXXVI.,"One faintest puff from passionate heat within,"
5187,XXXVI.,"Lo, breaking open some accursèd shell,"
5188,XXXVI.,It hatches forth foul broods of venomous life
5189,XXXVI.,"That come, blown backward by the changing wind,"
5190,XXXVI.,To haunt him who provok’d their devilish birth!
5191,XXXVI.,"By day they sting our eyes, and make us weep;"
5192,XXXVI.,"By night steal through unguarded gates of sense,"
5193,XXXVI.,And sting our souls in dreams!—My heart! and you?—
5194,XXXVI.,How could you deem my thoughtless words to be
5195,XXXVI.,The voice of so deform’d a wish as this?”
5196,XXXVI.,
5197,XXXVI.,"“But father,” said I, “he, the priest, your friend,—"
5198,XXXVI.,"At least, it seem’d—so thought.”"
5199,XXXVI.,"“The priest!” he cried,"
5200,XXXVI.,“Has he been meddling with your malady?—
5201,XXXVI.,My friend?—My friend is he no more.”
5202,XXXVI.,"“Nay, I,”"
5203,XXXVI.,"I said, “had sought his counsel; even then"
5204,XXXVI.,He said but little.”
5205,XXXVI.,“Little!” he rejoin’d;
5206,XXXVI.,"“That little was too much! Nay, never more—"
5207,XXXVI.,Yet hold.”—And here he paused.—“The priest has power—
5208,XXXVI.,"Yes, now I think of it, it need not all"
5209,XXXVI.,Be darkness; no.—The priest—one clew there is
5210,XXXVI.,"May clear this labyrinth.—The priest, he may,—"
5211,XXXVI.,"He shall an absolution get; yes, yes,"
5212,XXXVI.,"An absolution, that shall make us right.”"
5213,XXXVI.,
5214,XXXVI.,"And then my father, in his hopeful way,"
5215,XXXVI.,Recover’d somewhat. And he fondled me.
5216,XXXVI.,"“I see, my child, you love this Haydn, yes."
5217,XXXVI.,"Why, here you stand a woman when I thought"
5218,XXXVI.,"You only were my pet, my little girl.—"
5219,XXXVI.,"But do not cry: no, no; I honor you,"
5220,XXXVI.,"My little woman!—There, forgive me now;"
5221,XXXVI.,"Forgive my words. And when it comes, my child,"
5222,XXXVI.,"The absolution, then, we then shall see,"
5223,XXXVI.,If your old father can be kind or not.”
5224,XXXVI.,"With this he kiss’d me. And at that, I wept;"
5225,XXXVI.,Nor could I tell him that his hopes were vain.
5226,XXXVI.,I scarce could think myself that they were vain.
5227,XXXVI.,
5228,XXXVI.,
5229,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
5230,XXXVII.,
5231,XXXVII.,"From this time onward no one check’d me more,"
5232,XXXVII.,Attending Haydn. All the household heard
5233,XXXVII.,My sire “could trust his child to be discreet”;
5234,XXXVII.,And e’en Doretta too had something learn’d
5235,XXXVII.,That made her caution more than half relax.
5236,XXXVII.,
5237,XXXVII.,Then days and weeks and months pass’d quickly by
5238,XXXVII.,"In which, when Haydn’s prison’d love would start,"
5239,XXXVII.,"E’en while I heard the trembling of its bars,"
5240,XXXVII.,"My lips would check him, saying, gently, then,"
5241,XXXVII.,"“But not now, Haydn; nay, but we will wait.”"
5242,XXXVII.,
5243,XXXVII.,And thus a habit grew that our two lives
5244,XXXVII.,"Dwelt there like friends, made separate by war,"
5245,XXXVII.,"Who out from hostile camps, wave now a hand,"
5246,XXXVII.,"And now a kerchief, but who never speak."
5247,XXXVII.,And yet I cannot say love never spoke.—
5248,XXXVII.,We did not mean it; but I think that love
5249,XXXVII.,"May tell its tales, unconscious of the fact,"
5250,XXXVII.,For who is conscious when God touches him?—
5251,XXXVII.,But littlest acts there were; yet spirits read
5252,XXXVII.,From signs too fine for measurements of space;
5253,XXXVII.,Love heeds no measurements. But hints there were;
5254,XXXVII.,And yet what words of love yield more than these?
5255,XXXVII.,"They hit the sense of love, but fail of sense"
5256,XXXVII.,Where nothing loving waits to take the hint.
5257,XXXVII.,
5258,XXXVII.,This learn’d our souls at last; I wot not how.
5259,XXXVII.,"And kitten-like, at play beside the hearth,"
5260,XXXVII.,"We told our secrets, and none knew of them."
5261,XXXVII.,
5262,XXXVII.,
5263,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
5264,XXXVIII.,
5265,XXXVIII.,How swiftly sped the hours in happy nights
5266,XXXVIII.,"When, after work, he rested there at home!"
5267,XXXVIII.,Such winning ways he had to lure my trust!
5268,XXXVIII.,"Such sweet pet names would call me, till I felt"
5269,XXXVIII.,"So fondly small, he well might be my lord!"
5270,XXXVIII.,"Would tease me so, anon to comfort me!"
5271,XXXVIII.,Or rouse my temper that he mild might seem;
5272,XXXVIII.,"Or tell such tales, that in my dreams I laugh’d"
5273,XXXVIII.,"At wit reflecting, though distorting, his;"
5274,XXXVIII.,"Or better still, would play for me,—such strains!"
5275,XXXVIII.,"The very thought of them would seem like sleep,"
5276,XXXVIII.,"While half the night I linger’d still awake,"
5277,XXXVIII.,Half-conscious of the call of early birds
5278,XXXVIII.,And sparkling spray of light dash’d o’er the dews.
5279,XXXVIII.,
5280,XXXVIII.,
5281,XXXIX.,XXXIX.
5282,XXXIX.,
5283,XXXIX.,"At last, one night, when no one else was by,"
5284,XXXIX.,Some new impatience moved him; and he spoke:
5285,XXXIX.,"“Pauline, my friend, allow me only once;—"
5286,XXXIX.,"And say not, now, say not we still can wait:"
5287,XXXIX.,"Have I not waited long? Pauline, my own,"
5288,XXXIX.,What forms the substance of this mystery
5289,XXXIX.,"Whose dark shade rests about you? Surely, friend,"
5290,XXXIX.,The slightest will on your part would have power
5291,XXXIX.,To bid it off.”
5292,XXXIX.,"“Not so,” I answer’d him"
5293,XXXIX.,(I felt that I should tell him all at last);
5294,XXXIX.,“Not if the shade that so you speak of fall
5295,XXXIX.,From something you and I could not remove.”
5296,XXXIX.,
5297,XXXIX.,"“That cannot be,” he cried. “How can it be?"
5298,XXXIX.,Of old your father would not brook our love;
5299,XXXIX.,But lately much has done to forward it.”
5300,XXXIX.,
5301,XXXIX.,"“And know you then,” I asked, “what wrought his change?”"
5302,XXXIX.,
5303,XXXIX.,"“His wiser judgment,” answer’d he; “not so?”"
5304,XXXIX.,
5305,XXXIX.,"“Are there not times in life,” I asked, “and paths"
5306,XXXIX.,Where conscientiousness and love may cross?”
5307,XXXIX.,
5308,XXXIX.,"“There,” he exclaim’d, “the same old plea again!—"
5309,XXXIX.,"Your weakness is your wickedness. Why, friend,"
5310,XXXIX.,Does not our conscience come from consciousness?
5311,XXXIX.,"And when, then, are we conscious? When unwell:"
5312,XXXIX.,"Hot, swollen blood frets limbs that feel inflamed:"
5313,XXXIX.,A sound man lives unconscious of its flow.
5314,XXXIX.,And so a morbid train of foul ideas
5315,XXXIX.,"Will vex a soul diseased. But if in health,"
5316,XXXIX.,"Its aims all true to God and self,—what call"
5317,XXXIX.,"For conscience, which we wear but as the curb"
5318,XXXIX.,Whereby God reins the thought that love reins not?—
5319,XXXIX.,"If right I be, then nothing needs to cross"
5320,XXXIX.,Pure love. It may have freedom.—
5321,XXXIX.,“Or at most
5322,XXXIX.,Our conscience is the leaven of character;
5323,XXXIX.,"And just enough of it may sweeten life,"
5324,XXXIX.,"But too much keeps in ferment moods that work,"
5325,XXXIX.,"Like brewings, flung to froth and sediment:"
5326,XXXIX.,The froth flies up and off to vex our friends;
5327,XXXIX.,"The rest sinks down in self, embittering"
5328,XXXIX.,Our own experience.”
5329,XXXIX.,"“And yet,” I said,"
5330,XXXIX.,"“Our conscience, in religion”—"
5331,XXXIX.,"“There,” he cried,"
5332,XXXIX.,"“This too much conscience, overbalancing"
5333,XXXIX.,"All wiser judgment, has wrought worse results,"
5334,XXXIX.,"Made men crave heaven and fear for hell, so much"
5335,XXXIX.,"That, in the gap betwixt the two, was left"
5336,XXXIX.,No charity with which to do good here
5337,XXXIX.,While on the earth.”
5338,XXXIX.,"“I hope that mine,” I said,"
5339,XXXIX.,“Will prompt to some small good in present life.
5340,XXXIX.,"What would you say, some day, were I a nun?”"
5341,XXXIX.,
5342,XXXIX.,"“‘Say!’” answer’d he—and scorn was in the tone,—"
5343,XXXIX.,“What say?—why this: that if those blooming looks
5344,XXXIX.,"Hid wormy fruit like that, I ne’er would trust"
5345,XXXIX.,Sound health again!
5346,XXXIX.,"“Pauline, I half believe"
5347,XXXIX.,The conscience of a nun is consciousness
5348,XXXIX.,Of mere unrest—no more. In natures framed
5349,XXXIX.,"Of spirit, mind, and flesh, the cause may be"
5350,XXXIX.,Some sin that clogs the current of the soul;
5351,XXXIX.,"But, just as likely, thought that puzzles one;"
5352,XXXIX.,"Yes, yes, or indigestion, nerves diseased—"
5353,XXXIX.,No trace of sin whatever;—moods cured best
5354,XXXIX.,"By sunshine, clean clothes, larders full, good cheer.”"

5358,XL.,
5359,XL.,"His words I styled “irreverent, unjust!”—"
5360,XL.,
5361,XL.,"“I might be both of these,” he said, “in case"
5362,XL.,I blamed the poor souls for the life they lead.
5363,XL.,"But did I blame them? Nay, for in this world,"
5364,XL.,"Between youth’s immature credulity,"
5365,XL.,"That dares to think but what some guardian thinks,"
5366,XL.,"And manhood’s faith mature that thinks for itself,"
5367,XL.,A realm there is where will must learn to act
5368,XL.,"Through doubt and danger; where the character,"
5369,XL.,"First wean’d from oversight, must learn to choose."
5370,XL.,"Then, like a tottering child it yearns to cling"
5371,XL.,To one whose greater power can for it act.
5372,XL.,Its moods determine that to which they cling.
5373,XL.,Some girls are giddy:—they embrace a lover.
5374,XL.,And some are gloomy:—they beset a priest.
5375,XL.,"He, like the first, may ply his own designs,"
5376,XL.,"May take advantage of their weaker state,"
5377,XL.,"And capture them for veils, if not for vice.”"
5378,XL.,
5379,XL.,"“But marriage is a capture, too,” I said."
5380,XL.,
5381,XL.,"“If so,” he answer’d, “yet a natural state,"
5382,XL.,"Made statelier through authority of law,"
5383,XL.,"That, otherwise, might authorize the wrong;—"
5384,XL.,"A state to which, as not to convent life,"
5385,XL.,All social instincts prompt; may prompt the more
5386,XL.,The more one’s years. Who then can it forswear?—
5387,XL.,"Think you a maid, with half her moods unform’d"
5388,XL.,"At twenty, can conceive what thoughts may come"
5389,XL.,To turn or torture her at thirty-five?—
5390,XL.,
5391,XL.,"“But what, Pauline, Pauline,—you turning pale!—"
5392,XL.,"In earnest, were you!—Had you really thought?—"
5393,XL.,"In God’s name, darling, this could never be!—"
5394,XL.,Think only—Wherefore now?”
5395,XL.,"“Because,” I said,"
5396,XL.,“I hoped some good to do.”
5397,XL.,"“And do you deem,”"
5398,XL.,"He ask’d, “that then the Virgin did no good,"
5399,XL.,When nursing her sweet babe?—and was no saint?
5400,XL.,"And what of Christ, who ate and drank with all,"
5401,XL.,"Call’d glutton and a bibber, yes, of wine?—"
5402,XL.,Was He no saint?—What think you mortals need—
5403,XL.,To learn of life that never can be theirs?
5404,XL.,"Nay, nay, to learn of life, inspired by love,"
5405,XL.,"Which all can live, made better by its power."
5406,XL.,"If you a saint would be, oh, do not seek"
5407,XL.,"For truth so sunder’d from the common thought,"

5412,XLI.,
5413,XLI.,"“Are some,” I said, “not call’d in special ways"
5414,XLI.,"To nurse and tend the aged, sick, and poor?”"
5415,XLI.,
5416,XLI.,"“Are some not call’d,” he ask’d, “in special ways"
5417,XLI.,To tend like this the men they love the best?—
5418,XLI.,"Whate’er old age may need, needs it the most"
5419,XLI.,The young who old have grown before their time?—
5420,XLI.,"Need sick men nurses pale?—or poor men, those"
5421,XLI.,Whose moods have never stored the rich results
5422,XLI.,Mined from a world the world’s heir should explore?—
5423,XLI.,"Nay, nay, these all would be more ably served"
5424,XLI.,By spirits free to live their own love’s life.
5425,XLI.,Who gains aught where the spirit is not free?
5426,XLI.,"Think you the veil, too hastily assumed,"
5427,XLI.,"May never change the hues and views of life,"
5428,XLI.,Perverting them?—or cause beclouded love
5429,XLI.,"That might have bloom’d in light, to fade in gloom?"
5430,XLI.,’Tis only when those knowing what they leave
5431,XLI.,Turn calmly from all else to convent walls
5432,XLI.,That love should not dissuade them. Let them find
5433,XLI.,"Large, sunny, healthful halls; and dwell therein:"
5434,XLI.,From thence deal forth that gentle charity
5435,XLI.,So potent coming from a woman’s hand.
5436,XLI.,"Not strange it were if sickness, tended thus,"
5437,XLI.,"Enliven’d by her smiles of light, should flush"
5438,XLI.,"Or blush to perfect health! if wickedness,"
5439,XLI.,"Beneath incrusted woes of years of wrong,"
5440,XLI.,Should feel the earlier faith of childhood waked
5441,XLI.,"By woman’s voice, and thus be born again!—"
5442,XLI.,And find a life renew’d within the soul
5443,XLI.,As well as body. Let the convent thrive.
5444,XLI.,But rid it of all circumscribing vows.”
5445,XLI.,
5446,XLI.,“Of all its vows?” I ask’d.
5447,XLI.,“Why not?” he said:
5448,XLI.,"“No character, I think, grows wholly ripe"
5449,XLI.,Save that which grows as nature guides its growth;
5450,XLI.,And nature made us pairs. I know some say
5451,XLI.,The soul should conquer nature; but this means
5452,XLI.,"That spirits all should claim their rights,—be lords"
5453,XLI.,Of forms that spring from earth. But are they so
5454,XLI.,"When by a vow they swear to serve a form,"
5455,XLI.,And don the life and livery of a slave?
5456,XLI.,Would men look’d Godward more! ’Twould save their souls
5457,XLI.,From many a hell that their own hands have made.
5458,XLI.,"One time when young I stood before a tree,"
5459,XLI.,"And vow’d that, till an hour had pass’d away,"
5460,XLI.,My eye should see it not. What came of it?—
5461,XLI.,The vow in misery kept me through the hour.
5462,XLI.,"And had it been a maid and not a tree,"
5463,XLI.,The vow had caused me more of misery.
5464,XLI.,Yet God’s laws never bade me turn my back
5465,XLI.,"On tree or maid: nay, were my nature framed"
5466,XLI.,"With any touch of truth, these both were made"
5467,XLI.,For souls like mine to look at and enjoy.”

5472,XLII.,"“But, Haydn,” said I, “your strange convent, fill’d"
5473,XLII.,With age and vowless maids—you banish thence
5474,XLII.,"Christ’s life, self-sacrifice.”"
5475,XLII.,“And sacrifice
5476,XLII.,"But sates the worst of vanity,” he said,"
5477,XLII.,“Unless our yielding yield to higher good.
5478,XLII.,Christ’s work here glorified humanity—
5479,XLII.,"I must believe that souls, not when outside"
5480,XLII.,"The world but in the world, though not of it,"
5481,XLII.,"And in the body acting bodily,"
5482,XLII.,The lives transfiguring our common lives
5483,XLII.,"And common cares, the most resemble His.—"
5484,XLII.,The one who seeks to glorify herself
5485,XLII.,"In feigning burial to human cares,"
5486,XLII.,Humiliates rather her humanity.
5487,XLII.,She hints—not so?—that truest womanhood
5488,XLII.,"Is maidenhood?—By Eve and Mary, false!—"
5489,XLII.,"The mother lives the model of her sex,"
5490,XLII.,And not the maid. And she who seeks to lower
5491,XLII.,"The mother’s rank that she may lift her own,"
5492,XLII.,Yields less than she bids others yield to her.”
5493,XLII.,
5494,XLII.,"“But she serves God,” I said, “and others men.”"
5495,XLII.,
5496,XLII.,“How serves one God in doing this?” he ask’d.
5497,XLII.,"“God made our nature. Who make way with it,"
5498,XLII.,"Make way with manhood, turn to suicide."
5499,XLII.,He made the world where works His Providence
5500,XLII.,"To train our life. Who leave the world, leave Him—"
5501,XLII.,May add but more damnation to their woe.”
5502,XLII.,
5503,XLII.,"“But if men leave the world,” I said, “for this,—"
5504,XLII.,"That they may serve the Church, how leave they God?—"
5505,XLII.,They rather go to him.”
5506,XLII.,“What is the Church?”
5507,XLII.,He ask’d.
5508,XLII.,"“The kingdom of the Lord,” I said."
5509,XLII.,
5510,XLII.,"“Yes, yes,” he cried; “and add the Master’s words:"
5511,XLII.,"‘The kingdom is within you.’—And, if so,"
5512,XLII.,I own some right to heed the voice within;
5513,XLII.,"And none can rightly bid my spirit bend,"
5514,XLII.,A passive slave to laws outside of me.”

5521,XLIII.,"We must not judge for self, but reverence"
5522,XLIII.,The words of men ordain’d to teach the world;
5523,XLIII.,The words of men so learnèd in the truth;
5524,XLIII.,The words of councils fill’d with just such men.—
5525,XLIII.,No reverence have you for authority?”
5526,XLIII.,
5527,XLIII.,"“Mere common courtesy would teach me that,”"
5528,XLIII.,"He said. “And how could common piety,"
5529,XLIII.,"If awed before the Power above the sky,"
5530,XLIII.,Deny a kindred awe to power on earth?
5531,XLIII.,The Church has power—and more. I reverence it.
5532,XLIII.,It may be God’s own storehouse of the truth.
5533,XLIII.,"But ah, some truths have never yet been stored!"
5534,XLIII.,"Infinity is broad, and broad enough"
5535,XLIII.,"For truth to grow within me and without,"
5536,XLIII.,In self as well as in the best about it.
5537,XLIII.,"And I believe that all things God makes grow,"
5538,XLIII.,Unfold in ways that work in harmony.
5539,XLIII.,"And, when I love a soul as you I love,"

5541,XLIII.,"In front of them the pope, in front of him"
5542,XLIII.,"A shining form put forth by them as Christ,"
5543,XLIII.,"And tell me this pure love could lie to me,"
5544,XLIII.,I would not”—
5545,XLIII.,“Haydn stop!—dare not!” I cried;—
5546,XLIII.,"“And I have pray’d to God so much, so much,"
5547,XLIII.,To make you more submissive.”
5548,XLIII.,“I submit
5549,XLIII.,"To God,” he said; “but with my love to God,"
5550,XLIII.,How can I yield the godliest thing I own?”
5551,XLIII.,
5552,XLIII.,"And there he sat, so firm and yet so kind,"
5553,XLIII.,"I could not help but sigh, “You make me doubt.”"
5554,XLIII.,
5555,XLIII.,"“Would God,” he said, “I could do that for you!"
5556,XLIII.,Then might you have true faith. Where springs from will
5557,XLIII.,One wise effect that does not follow doubt?
5558,XLIII.,One choice that does not weigh alternatives?
5559,XLIII.,Doubt comes with waverings of the balances
5560,XLIII.,Before the heavier motive settles down.
5561,XLIII.,"Let those who feel so sure their views are right,"
5562,XLIII.,Dissolve my doubt:—I dare to doubt if they
5563,XLIII.,Walk not by knowledge rather than by faith.
5564,XLIII.,"I read that Jesus answer’d him who pray’d,"
5565,XLIII.,"‘Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief’;"
5566,XLIII.,That on the cross itself even He could cry:
5567,XLIII.,"‘My God, O why hast thou forsaken me?’"
5568,XLIII.,"And so I think, at times, these doubts of ours"
5569,XLIII.,"May only rise like minor preludes here,"
5570,XLIII.,"Ere that triumphant cadence, ‘It is finished.’"
5571,XLIII.,"But come, Pauline,” he added then with warmth,"
5572,XLIII.,"“And promise me that you will yield them up,"
5573,XLIII.,"These dark, sad thoughts. Why, they could make of me"
5574,XLIII.,An infidel outright! Could faith destroy
5575,XLIII.,"Our love, what good then might it not destroy?”"
5576,XLIII.,"A wonder is it, that to moods like this"

5585,XLIV.,"Poor man, he spent his hours alternately."
5586,XLIV.,At times he urged; at times he chided me;
5587,XLIV.,At times he kiss’d my cheek and look’d at me;
5588,XLIV.,"At times he took me by the hand, and said:"
5589,XLIV.,"“My daughter, dear, we will defer the deed”;"
5590,XLIV.,At times he moaned: “My daughter will do right.”

5595,XLV.,"Then slowly dawn’d on Haydn’s mind the fact,"

5598,XLV.,And all the neighbors gazed so piteously:
5599,XLV.,"If they had clothed my body in a shroud,"
5600,XLV.,"And I had loiter’d round it there, a ghost,"
5601,XLV.,Life scarce had seem’d more lonely or more chill.
5602,XLV.,

5605,XLV.,"Who knew his grief? Alas, who knew it not?"
5606,XLV.,Did ever harpsichord so crave a voice
5607,XLV.,To utter forth a cry of full despair?
5608,XLV.,Did ever aught that human hands could touch
5609,XLV.,So tremble to reveal such agony
5610,XLV.,"As wrung the frame of him whose fingers wrought,"

5616,XLVI.,
5617,XLVI.,"Through all those days how heeded I each sound,"

5619,XLVI.,Would hold my breath between the notes to feel
5620,XLVI.,His own suspense before the impending strain
5621,XLVI.,"When fell, anon, the spirit’s overflow."
5622,XLVI.,I never so had trembled at the peals
5623,XLVI.,Of thunder as beneath the chords he struck;
5624,XLVI.,Nor felt my cheek so moist by rains as there
5625,XLVI.,By tears that flow’d as flow’d his melodies;
5626,XLVI.,While all the air about appear’d surcharged
5627,XLVI.,"With dangerous force electric, touch’d alone"
5628,XLVI.,To flash keen suffering from his heart to mine.
5629,XLVI.,"And yet, each day, his music sweeter swell’d."
5630,XLVI.,"Ere that, it may have lack’d in undertone,"
5631,XLVI.,The pleading pathos of half-utter’d grief:
5632,XLVI.,"Since then, I never hear it but it seems"
5633,XLVI.,"As if the heavens had been bereaved of love,"
5634,XLVI.,And pour’d their sad complaint on earth beneath;
5635,XLVI.,And I who listen to the sweetness of it
5636,XLVI.,Can never tell if I should smile or weep
5637,XLVI.,"To think that it has come so far below,"
5638,XLVI.,Or feel that it has left so much above.
5639,XLVI.,
5640,XLVI.,
5641,XLVII.,XLVII.
5642,XLVII.,
5643,XLVII.,One night I found my father still more sad
5644,XLVII.,"Than was his wont. I knelt before him then,"
5645,XLVII.,"And “O my father, why is this?” I ask’d."
5646,XLVII.,But he said nothing. Then I question’d him:
5647,XLVII.,And found the cause out. Haydn was the cause.
5648,XLVII.,"My father loved him so, as men love sons;"
5649,XLVII.,And long had hoped he might a son become.
5650,XLVII.,"But they had talk’d in confidence, and talk’d"
5651,XLVII.,"About Doretta. “Ah,” my father sigh’d;"
5652,XLVII.,“My plans for all of you are vain!—
5653,XLVII.,“Why now?”
5654,XLVII.,"He cried, “in this my old age, now, too late"
5655,XLVII.,"To be replaced again, should I have lost"
5656,XLVII.,"My aims, my home, my hope, my happiness?—"
5657,XLVII.,And who has brought it on? has done such wrong
5658,XLVII.,"His deeds deserve it?—Here am I, myself,—"
5659,XLVII.,"I loved you, loved you both, but plann’d your good:"
5660,XLVII.,The priest loved (so he says) the Church and you:
5661,XLVII.,Doretta loved; sought only love’s full fruit:
5662,XLVII.,And Haydn loved; wish’d but to show his love:
5663,XLVII.,"And you, child, loved, were but obedient:"
5664,XLVII.,"We all of us were loving, were we not?"
5665,XLVII.,"Yet working outward, wisely, as we deem’d,"
5666,XLVII.,We all have done the thing to doom us all.
5667,XLVII.,Alas what power has wrought to thwart us thus?
5668,XLVII.,"I do believe, though long I doubted it,"
5669,XLVII.,There lives a Devil! Hell-scorch’d hands alone
5670,XLVII.,"Could weave such death-black shrouds from thread so bright,"
5671,XLVII.,"Drawn from sleek skeins of love. That spider-fiend,"
5672,XLVII.,"Feeding on our sweet plans, emits this web,"
5673,XLVII.,"To trip and trap us in like flies!—Ah me,"
5674,XLVII.,It may be well that one should suffer here
5675,XLVII.,Until a wish bereaved shriek prayers for death;
5676,XLVII.,But through what fearful pangs earth peels away
5677,XLVII.,This withering flesh from off the worthier soul!
5678,XLVII.,"The scales about my own grow thin, how thin!"
5679,XLVII.,"Pauline and Haydn gone, and home, and hope,—"
5680,XLVII.,What further shred invests the love so stript!—
5681,XLVII.,"Is this, then, being freed from earth?—Yet where"
5682,XLVII.,"Are signs of heaven?—My God, I see them not.”"
5683,XLVII.,
5684,XLVII.,"“O father, rave not thus,” I cried. “O if—"
5685,XLVII.,"If Haydn,—if I had some power with him.”—"
5686,XLVII.,
5687,XLVII.,"“Nay, daughter, nay,” he said. Yet o’er his face"
5688,XLVII.,"Flush’d hope like hues at dawn. I kiss’d his brow,"
5689,XLVII.,"Said, “Father, I will try,” and went my way."
5690,XLVII.,
5691,XLVII.,
5692,XLVIII.,XLVIII.
5693,XLVIII.,
5694,XLVIII.,"And Haydn then, when found, appear’d so sad."
5695,XLVIII.,"“Ah,” sigh’d he, “we two souls were fitted so"
5696,XLVIII.,"To match each other. Here, where jars the world,"
5697,XLVIII.,"And all goes contrary, where every sun"
5698,XLVIII.,"That ripes this, withers that; and every storm"
5699,XLVIII.,"That brings refreshment here, sends deluge there,"
5700,XLVIII.,"We two, exceptions to the general rule,"
5701,XLVIII.,Like living miracles (is love fulfill’d
5702,XLVIII.,"A miracle indeed?), seem’d born to draw"
5703,XLVIII.,The self-same tale of weal or woe from each.
5704,XLVIII.,"I saw but last night, darling, in my dreams,"
5705,XLVIII.,Our spirits journeying through this under gloom:
5706,XLVIII.,"And hand in hand they walk’d; and over them,"
5707,XLVIII.,"As over limner’d seraphs, did there hang"
5708,XLVIII.,"A halo, love reflected. By its glow"
5709,XLVIII.,"The gloom about grew brightness: while far off,"
5710,XLVIII.,"In clearest lines, the path passed up and on.—"
5711,XLVIII.,"Pauline, but heed me: once again, I pray"
5712,XLVIII.,"(If ever once I pray’d to God above),"
5713,XLVIII.,Blot not this light from all my future life.”
5714,XLVIII.,
5715,XLVIII.,
5716,XLIX.,XLIX.
5717,XLIX.,
5718,XLIX.,"“Ah, Haydn,” said I, “would you have me change?"
5719,XLIX.,What soul shall dwell on God’s most holy hill
5720,XLIX.,"But he ‘that sweareth to his own hurt,’ yes,"
5721,XLIX.,‘And changeth not’?”
5722,XLIX.,"“But yet,” he said, “but yet"
5723,XLIX.,If you were wrong to swear? How can it be
5724,XLIX.,That any project so against the soul—
5725,XLIX.,Each instinct of one’s nature—should be right?”
5726,XLIX.,
5727,XLIX.,"“Yet nature,” said I, “may be but corrupt."
5728,XLIX.,"What is this instinct, that it should not lie?"
5729,XLIX.,If one should feel the instinct of the lamb
5730,XLIX.,While skipping to welcome the butcher’s knife
5731,XLIX.,"That waits to slaughter it, would he be wise"
5732,XLIX.,To follow instinct?”
5733,XLIX.,“Why not?” answer’d he:
5734,XLIX.,“The lamb was made that it might die for man:
5735,XLIX.,It follows instinct and dies easily.
5736,XLIX.,The soul was made that it might live for God:
5737,XLIX.,It follows instinct and lives happily.
5738,XLIX.,The cases differ thus. May there not be
5739,XLIX.,"Some depth, beyond the reach of mortal sight,"
5740,XLIX.,Within whose grooves unseen our spirits glide
5741,XLIX.,Unconscious of the balancings of will?
5742,XLIX.,God’s touch may be too subtle to be sensed.
5743,XLIX.,"May it not stir beneath all conscious powers,"
5744,XLIX.,A spontaneity that moves the soul
5745,XLIX.,"As instinct moves the body?—Ah, to me,"
5746,XLIX.,Love seems an instinct that impels them both.”
5747,XLIX.,
5748,XLIX.,"“How so?” I ask’d, in hope to guide his thought"
5749,XLIX.,Toward sacrifice.
5750,XLIX.,"“You wish me then,” he said,"
5751,XLIX.,“To turn philosopher for you?—I will.
5752,XLIX.,"This love, in morals based on faith in man,"
5753,XLIX.,"And in religion on our faith in God,"
5754,XLIX.,"Seems, in its essence, an experience"
5755,XLIX.,"Not wholly feeling, yet not wholly thought,—"
5756,XLIX.,"Not all of body, yet not all of soul,"
5757,XLIX.,"Of what we are or what we are to be,—"
5758,XLIX.,"But more akin to marriage, within self,"
5759,XLIX.,"Of our two separate natures, form and spirit."
5760,XLIX.,"God meant them to be join’d: when wedded thus,"
5761,XLIX.,"One rests content, the other waits in hope.”"
5762,XLIX.,
5763,XLIX.,"“To rest, to wait,” I said to this; “and if"
5764,XLIX.,"Such ends displaced were, would there not remain"
5765,XLIX.,The work that forms our earthly heritage?”
5766,XLIX.,
5767,XLIX.,"“And may not God,” rejoin’d he, “grant us more"
5768,XLIX.,Than that which we inherit?”
5769,XLIX.,“He may grant
5770,XLIX.,"His rest,” I said. “Yet rest, the Paradise"
5771,XLIX.,"Of work, is yet the Purgatory, too,"
5772,XLIX.,Of indolence.”
5773,XLIX.,“The soul’s true Paradise
5774,XLIX.,"Is nothing earn’d,” he said. “It is a gift."
5775,XLIX.,"With Eden lost, insolvent made by sin,"
5776,XLIX.,"Work, as I view it, is a loan from Hope"
5777,XLIX.,With which man pays the debt of Memory.
5778,XLIX.,"But if I reckon right, a pauper still,"
5779,XLIX.,He scarce can earn enough to pay them both.
5780,XLIX.,"And so our rest, I take it, is a gift"
5781,XLIX.,"That crowns our strife, yet is not won by it;"
5782,XLIX.,"Which, as we live not conscious how ’tis earn’d,"
5783,XLIX.,We live not conscious how it may be lost.
5784,XLIX.,Things out of consciousness are out of care.
5785,XLIX.,We rest not as in death that furthers naught;
5786,XLIX.,"We rest as in a dream, in sleep,—a state"
5787,XLIX.,Wherein God watches while the soul regales.
5788,XLIX.,"We rest not from the healthful stir of work,"
5789,XLIX.,But from the slavery proportioning
5790,XLIX.,"Our pleasure to our pain—a law for serfs,"
5791,XLIX.,"But not for sons. Our rest is peaceful, hush’d,"
5792,XLIX.,"The very church of choice, as different"
5793,XLIX.,From other joy as prayer may be from sport.”
5794,XLIX.,
5795,XLIX.,"“And does not choice,” I ask’d, “feel often moved"
5796,XLIX.,To spurn a lesser for a greater good?
5797,XLIX.,"For greater good, too, may not Love on high"
5798,XLIX.,Unseat some idol of our ignorance?”—

5802,L.,
5803,L.,"With this, I pictured for him brightest life;"
5804,L.,"And, like a blot on every scene, myself;"
5805,L.,I claim’d my character was not the one
5806,L.,"That best could aid his own; show’d how my sire,"
5807,L.,"The priest, Doretta, all agreed in this."
5808,L.,"And then, in contrast with myself, I sketch’d"
5809,L.,A nature all deem’d fitted for his moods.
5810,L.,"I may have sinn’d in it; but, grim as fate,"
5811,L.,"My father’s face, recall’d, would urge me on;"
5812,L.,I noted all Doretta’s nobler traits;
5813,L.,"And when I thought he must my aim surmise,"
5814,L.,"And while he held his gaze upon the floor,"
5815,L.,"As though he gave assent, at last I spake"
5816,L.,Doretta’s name.
5817,L.,And if the solid earth
5818,L.,"Had quaked, he had not started more. O God,"
5819,L.,Why did I not accept his instinct then!
5820,L.,"He look’d at me, first pale, then flush’d, then firm;"
5821,L.,"And then with tremulous, painful breath, he said:—"
5822,L.,"“And this device from you? from you, so pure?"
5823,L.,So free from guile? You should have spared me this.
5824,L.,"That Jesuit has train’d you well! Ah, now,"
5825,L.,I know how Adam grieved that Eve could fall;
5826,L.,"How Eve herself, when round her soul first crept"
5827,L.,"The serpent’s cautious coils of smooth deceit,"
5828,L.,"To strap her inch by inch! I read it now,"
5829,L.,"That tale: ’tis all an allegory, ay;—"
5830,L.,"That serpent means the world. The world steals round,"
5831,L.,Intent to seize and own each heir of heaven.
5832,L.,"Not long are souls allow’d ideal life,"
5833,L.,Not long unfetter’d sense or hearts unbound:
5834,L.,"Our smiles grow stiffer, till, some fatal day,"
5835,L.,"The last is clutch’d and held, a hideous grin."
5836,L.,"Then, when the body stirs not with the soul,"
5837,L.,"The last nerve wrested from the Spirit’s rule,"
5838,L.,"Naught in us left of love, the world unwinds:"
5839,L.,Our capturer dissolves in mist or dust:—
5840,L.,"And we, for its embrace, have lost our God!”"
5841,L.,
5842,L.,
5843,LI.,LI.
5844,LI.,
5845,LI.,"His mood alarm’d me, yet could I protest:"
5846,LI.,"“Nay, Haydn, nay! I do not love the world:"
5847,LI.,"I long to leave it; yes, all thought of it.”"
5848,LI.,"“How much less worldliness is found,” he ask’d,"
5849,LI.,“Within the Church than in your world so call’d?—
5850,LI.,The Prince of this World is not nice in choice
5851,LI.,"Of equipages; where he cannot check,"
5852,LI.,He mounts the car of truth and grasps the rein;
5853,LI.,"And when the Devil drives, he drives for home."
5854,LI.,"‘The world,’ what means this, but the world alone,—"
5855,LI.,"The mass, devoid of mind, truth, spirit, love?—"
5856,LI.,"But holds no church the same?—A mass?—ay, ay."
5857,LI.,Devoid of mind?—Why not?—But show the place
5858,LI.,It crowds not reason out to edge in faith.—
5859,LI.,"But ‘faith,’ say you, ‘is reasonable’?—Ay,"
5860,LI.,When in it there is reason; when the thing
5861,LI.,In which it trusts is truth. But ah! too oft
5862,LI.,"Just prick the forms, and back of them you find—"
5863,LI.,"What?—truth?—nay, nay, a priest—a man, forsooth,"
5864,LI.,"Who differs from the rest of men in clothes,"
5865,LI.,"In wearing worn-out habits, which the need"
5866,LI.,And progress of our times have cast aside;—
5867,LI.,"Ay, wearing them o’er body, mind, and soul;"
5868,LI.,"Though all who think know well that moods, whose range"
5869,LI.,"Is girt by customs past, (which could alone"
5870,LI.,Prejudge thought’s present range) fit prejudice;
5871,LI.,And this is in behind your Church’s forms.
5872,LI.,
5873,LI.,"“You say, perhaps, ‘the Spirit formed the forms"
5874,LI.,To fit the life’?—they fitted life that was;
5875,LI.,"But life, if life, will grow; the life of love"
5876,LI.,"Has not yet fill’d the scope around, above,"
5877,LI.,Of heavens that for it wait. What form’d the forms
5878,LI.,Can still be forming them.—If forms exist
5879,LI.,"Wherein no Spirit works, no present life,—"
5880,LI.,The things are hollow; and a hollow form
5881,LI.,"The Devil flies for, like a flying squirrel"
5882,LI.,"For hollow tree-trunks; and when once within,"
5883,LI.,"But half disguised inside his robes of white,"
5884,LI.,"Loud chanting out mere ceremonious cant,"
5885,LI.,He tempts toward his hypocrisy an age
5886,LI.,"That knows too much of Christian life, at last,"
5887,LI.,For heathen life to tempt it.
5888,LI.,
5889,LI.,“Judge by fruits:
5890,LI.,Here you—God gave you beauty—to be seen!
5891,LI.,"And grace to bless this dear, sweet home. What power"
5892,LI.,Would snatch you from us? make a very hell
5893,LI.,Of what might else be heaven?—Think you ’tis love?
5894,LI.,Not so; it only hates love; plays the part—
5895,LI.,"Not of the Christ who yielded up his life,"
5896,LI.,But of the world that made him yield it up;
5897,LI.,"It only trusts in force, in force that lies;"
5898,LI.,And now that it can hold you with a vow
5899,LI.,"Which but deceit could claim that God enjoin’d,"
5900,LI.,"It seizes you to plunge you down, down, down,"
5901,LI.,To feel the full damnation of a faith
5902,LI.,That can believe the voice within the soul
5903,LI.,A lying guide which cannot be obey’d
5904,LI.,"Without foul consciousness of inward sin,—"
5905,LI.,"To plunge you down, and hold you till the cells"
5906,LI.,"Of your pure, guileless heart, all stain’d and steep’d,"
5907,LI.,Drip only dregs of stagnant viciousness!”
5908,LI.,
5909,LI.,
5910,LII.,LII.
5911,LII.,
5912,LII.,"“You terrify me, Haydn!” I exclaim’d."
5913,LII.,“And you have done far more to me!” he cried.
5914,LII.,"“You were—Ah me, what were you not?—so pure,"
5915,LII.,Transparent as the mid-day atmosphere.
5916,LII.,Should some red thunderbolt from sunlight burst
5917,LII.,"And burn all torturing blindness through my eyes,"
5918,LII.,"The night came less foretoken’d! I, who dream’d"
5919,LII.,"That here I gazed on truth, here bent these knees"
5920,LII.,"Upon the very battlements of heaven,—"
5921,LII.,"I to be tript thus from my dear proud trust,"
5922,LII.,Sent reeling down by such foul-aim’d deceit!—
5923,LII.,Strange is it if my jolted brain should slip
5924,LII.,The grooves of reason?—if I rave or curse?—
5925,LII.,"You, who had known my heart, and after that,"
5926,LII.,"And after I had warn’d you of the thing,"
5927,LII.,"And simulating all the while such love,—"
5928,LII.,"You, vowing to abjure me! more than this,"
5929,LII.,"To-day with such cold-blooded, soulless tact,"
5930,LII.,"Soft-stealing, through the door-ways left ajar,"
5931,LII.,"Within the inmost chambers of my heart,"
5932,LII.,"To snare,—as though the victim of a cat"
5933,LII.,"That could be play’d with, trick’d with, kill’d, cast off,—"
5934,LII.,"This heart of mine which, as you might have known,"
5935,LII.,"Was throbbing but to serve you!—Yes, once more,"
5936,LII.,"You gain your end! Once more, your wish is mine."
5937,LII.,How can I love?—God help me!—Go you free.”
5938,LII.,
5939,LII.,
5940,LIII.,LIII.
5941,LIII.,
5942,LIII.,How fiercely then did Haydn’s music storm!
5943,LIII.,And soon he would have left our home in haste:
5944,LIII.,My father spoke to stay him. Long they spoke;
5945,LIII.,And sometimes wrathful were the words they used.
5946,LIII.,"But then, at last, my father told him all,—"
5947,LIII.,"Why I had vow’d, that I his life might save,"
5948,LIII.,And he broke down before it.
5949,LIII.,Never more
5950,LIII.,May God permit me to behold again
5951,LIII.,"A broken man! Alas, how pleaded he!"
5952,LIII.,"And pray’d me for my pardon o’er and o’er,"
5953,LIII.,Till wellnigh I believed he heard me not;
5954,LIII.,"And in the end sigh’d out: “It might be so,"
5955,LIII.,"My plan be wisest; nay, he would not yield"
5956,LIII.,"His manlier judgment, to fulfil my wish,"
5957,LIII.,"To make me happy, or my sire or me:—"
5958,LIII.,Doretta surely was a housewife wise:
5959,LIII.,"It seem’d the older custom, thus to wed:"
5960,LIII.,"He young had been, had whims.—God bless us all.”"
5961,LIII.,
5962,LIII.,
5963,LIV.,LIV.
5964,LIV.,
5965,LIV.,"Oft, after that, I urged him ne’er to wed"
5966,LIV.,One whom he could not love. He only sigh’d:
5967,LIV.,"“This heart of mine that once loved you, Pauline,"
5968,LIV.,How could it love again with love as true?
5969,LIV.,"Yet what, if not? My soul was immature,"
5970,LIV.,"Romantic, young. It must be manly now."
5971,LIV.,A man has breadth. I take it manly love
5972,LIV.,Is love that yields most blessings to the most.
5973,LIV.,"And mine shall bless yourself, your father, her.”—"
5974,LIV.,And so he calm’d my doubt and cheer’d me much.
5975,LIV.,
5976,LIV.,
5977,LV.,LV.
5978,LV.,
5979,LV.,And oft I spoke with him about the Church.
5980,LV.,“Can I forget its holding you?” he ask’d.
5981,LV.,
5982,LV.,"“Ah, Haydn,” said I, “I remember once"
5983,LV.,"When young you were, when music scarce had lured"
5984,LV.,"Your soul, so thrill’d! to test its energies:"
5985,LV.,"Then Gluck your master was; you follow’d him,"
5986,LV.,"And far beyond your own, as then you deem’d,"
5987,LV.,Flowed forth the full perfection of his chords.
5988,LV.,"Now men see Gluck behind you. Yet, e’en now,"
5989,LV.,"Before you still, sweet chords allure you on."
5990,LV.,"Ah, friend, Gluck only happen’d in the path"
5991,LV.,That open’d then beyond you. But those chords?—
5992,LV.,"Those you can reach not, Haydn, till you reach"
5993,LV.,The choirs of heaven!
5994,LV.,"“And thus, at times, I think"
5995,LV.,That I too may have happen’d in your path;
5996,LV.,"And this, your love, now looking toward myself,"
5997,LV.,"May gaze, when I am gone, on holier things,"
5998,LV.,Ideal all.”
5999,LV.,"“When you—alas,” he sigh’d,"
6000,LV.,"“When you are gone, then life will all become—"
6001,LV.,I fear it much—one lonely wail for you.”
6002,LV.,
6003,LV.,"“And yet a lonely wail, breathed forth,” I said,"
6004,LV.,"“From one with spirit sweeten’d, sweet may seem"
6005,LV.,To earth that hears it.”
6006,LV.,"“Ah, I take the thought,"
6007,LV.,"You mean my music,” answer’d he. “O God,"
6008,LV.,To save one’s art must love be sacrificed?—
6009,LV.,"Redeem’d at that price, art would be too dear!”"
6010,LV.,
6011,LV.,
6012,LVI.,LVI.
6013,LVI.,
6014,LVI.,One thing he promis’d me. I urged it much.
6015,LVI.,"“In secret convent-prayers,” I said to him,"
6016,LVI.,“My soul must know if it should praise or plead.
6017,LVI.,"A year from now, we two must meet once more."
6018,LVI.,"We cannot talk, and yet we may commune"
6019,LVI.,While I stand silent at the cloister bars.
6020,LVI.,Then if your wedded life afford you joy—
6021,LVI.,"I doubt it not,—bring with you fresh-pluck’d flowers;"
6022,LVI.,"If else than this, bring but the wilted stems"
6023,LVI.,Of these I give you now.”
6024,LVI.,Then soon had pass’d
6025,LVI.,The last vague hours that saw me part from all.
6026,LVI.,I stood before the shrine. I feel it yet:—
6027,LVI.,The organ moaning sweetly far away;
6028,LVI.,The people whispering low amid the aisles;
6029,LVI.,"My heart so loud, nor hush’d in sermon-time;"
6030,LVI.,The multitude with wide eyes fix’d on me;
6031,LVI.,"Doretta, and my father, still and sad;"
6032,LVI.,"And Haydn’s face upon his pale, pale hands."
6033,LVI.,
6034,LVI.,
6035,LVII.,LVII.
6036,LVII.,
6037,LVII.,"And two months after that I saw them wed,"
6038,LVII.,"My Haydn and Doretta, in the church."
6039,LVII.,"And, since then, I have pray’d for him long days,"
6040,LVII.,And longer nights; and I have oft had hopes
6041,LVII.,That my faint life new strength would gain from God.
6042,LVII.,"But now so white, so thin, my body seems,"
6043,LVII.,With scarce enough of substance left in it
6044,LVII.,"To be a ghost;—ah, what if, like a ghost,"
6045,LVII.,It soon should vanish?
6046,LVII.,"So I thought, to-night,"
6047,LVII.,"If I could tell you this, confess my fault,"
6048,LVII.,"Unload my heart of all her sweet, sad love,"
6049,LVII.,"That God might give me rest. I did not, nay,"
6050,LVII.,"I did not mean it, to excite myself."
6051,LVII.,They told me it might bring my death; but oh!
6052,LVII.,Have I not borne enough to merit life?
6053,LVII.,"How had I counted all these weeks and days,"
6054,LVII.,"Up to the hour we two should meet again,"
6055,LVII.,"And I should find how all my prayers were heard,"
6056,LVII.,And heaven had made my Haydn blest!—
6057,LVII.,"He came,"
6058,LVII.,"Last week: and what, what, think you, can it mean?—"
6059,LVII.,He brought the wilted stems.—
6060,LVII.,I do not know.
6061,LVII.,I only know that I can earn no rest:
6062,LVII.,And all our household so much else have earn’d.
6063,LVII.,And now how can I?—I can try no more;
6064,LVII.,But all my pathway has been block’d for me.
6065,LVII.,"They say such words are infidelity,—"
6066,LVII.,O Christ!—yet I can try no more.
6067,LVII.,Hark! hark!—
6068,LVII.,Is not that Haydn’s hymn we hear again?—
6069,LVII.,"How faint it sounds!—or I, I faint may be."
6070,LVII.,The window—move me. There—look out—those clouds—
6071,LVII.,"The sunset?—Ah, what comes on earth so bright,"
6072,LVII.,So beautiful as clouds?—There were no clouds
6073,LVII.,Where one could always look and see the heaven.
6074,LVII.,"The music, hear it—hear how sweet!—Say, say,"
6075,LVII.,Did I sing then?—Not so?—and only dream’d?—
6076,LVII.,"I thought that music mine, and then myself;"
6077,LVII.,"And Haydn’s heart, it beat here, beat in me,—"
6078,LVII.,"Ah me, so tired!—Yes, let me rest on you."
6079,LVII.,"O God, for but one hour to live!—For what?"
6080,LVII.,"Have I not loved then?—Yes, and tell him so,"
6081,LVII.,"Tell Haydn; thank him.—God, praise Him for it."
6082,LVII.,"Life, life—I did not know it—has been sweet.—"
6083,LVII.,Hark! music!—Does it not come from above?

6101,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,
6102,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,A strange fish came from an inland home
6103,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,On a journey down to the sea.
6104,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"He split the ripples, and ript the foam,"
6105,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,And danced and dived in glee.
6106,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"“Ho, ho!” cried the fry where the sea grew near,"
6107,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,“Hurrah for a fresh-water fool!
6108,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,One gulp of our salt when he comes out here
6109,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,Will send him back to his pool.”
6110,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,
6111,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"The fish was fleet, but the bar was high,"
6112,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,And the low tide roil’d and dim;
6113,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"And he groped, as he slowly pass’d the fry,"
6114,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,And to and fro would swim.
6115,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"“Ho, ho!” cried they, as they shook their scales,"
6116,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,“The muddled one misses his way!”
6117,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"And they fann’d their fins, and slash’d their tails—"
6118,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"“Aha, he here will stay!”"
6119,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,
6120,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,The fish paused not till the way grew clear;
6121,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,Then launch’d out under the spray;
6122,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,And shower’d his fins in a white-cap near
6123,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,That rivall’d the rays of the day.
6124,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"“Ho, ho, showing off to the sharks!” cried the fry;"
6125,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,“And look—a gull on the shoal.
6126,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,Yon surface-shiner would better be shy;
6127,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,The bird will swallow him whole.”
6128,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,
6129,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"The fish pass’d on, till the sea grew deep,"
6130,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"Then, plunging down through the blue,"
6131,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"A flash came back from a parting leap,"
6132,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,As at last he sank from view.
6133,FOR THE LITTLE CRITICS.,"“Ho, ho,” cried the fry, “we can all do that,"

6144,I.,"The monument stands, no longer the care"
6145,I.,Of mallet and chisel and plummet and square.
6146,I.,With a flourish of trumpets and rolling of drums
6147,I.,The glad hour comes
6148,I.,When the statue above it will loom unveil’d.
6149,I.,"Lo, now the crowds that are under it sway;"
6150,I.,The bugles are sounding; and look!—away
6151,I.,"The veil is dropt!—and afar is hail’d,"

6157,II.,
6158,II.,"How the crowd are cheering! but, ah, their cheer"
6159,II.,Recalls a day
6160,II.,When few were here;
6161,II.,"And the most of them daintily shrank away,"
6162,II.,Afraid a foot or a frill to smear
6163,II.,"In the mire of this place, while deep in the clay"
6164,II.,The soil was dug for the monument here.
6165,II.,
6166,II.,
6167,III.,III.
6168,III.,
6169,III.,"And was there not, when his course began,"
6170,III.,"While clearing the ground for the life he had plann’d,"
6171,III.,A time this crowd would have shrunk from the man
6172,III.,Whose image is now enthroned by the land?
6173,III.,"Alas, how oft in youth’s chill morn"
6174,III.,Their tears alone are the dews that adorn
6175,III.,The natures that wake
6176,III.,To the light of a day beginning to break!
6177,III.,
6178,III.,"And oft how long, ere the light will burst,"
6179,III.,The mists of the valley surround them first!
6180,III.,"And oh, how many and many a tomb"
6181,III.,"Of a dead hope, buried and left in gloom,"
6182,III.,Must mark the path of the man whose need
6183,III.,Is taught through failure how to succeed!
6184,III.,"And oft how long, ere he knows of this,"
6185,III.,Will hard work doom
6186,III.,His heart that in sympathy seeks for bliss
6187,III.,"To a life as lone as death in a tomb,"
6188,III.,Where sweetness and light
6189,III.,"Are all shut out,"
6190,III.,Nor a flower nor a bird
6191,III.,"Is heeded or heard,"
6192,III.,"Nor often, if ever, there comes a sight"
6193,III.,"Of a friend who cares what he cares about,"
6194,III.,Or is willing to soil
6195,III.,A finger with even a touch of his toil!
6196,III.,For our race are too ready to turn with a sneer
6197,III.,"From arms that are brawny, and hands that smear"
6198,III.,"While a man is dependent, in need of a friend,"
6199,III.,"The world is a snob, and shuns its own peer."
6200,III.,"When a man is a master, his need at an end,"
6201,III.,"The world is a sycophant, cringing to cheer."

6210,IV.,"But the monument knew a different day,"
6211,IV.,When masons with mortar and mallet wrought here
6212,IV.,The firm and deep foundation to lay.
6213,IV.,Still few would turn from the well-trod way
6214,IV.,To climb the mounds of marble and clay
6215,IV.,"Which hid the work; or, if some drew near,"
6216,IV.,"They only came with a stare of surprise,"

6225,V.,The meed that the present is proud to pay!
6226,V.,"When all sailing is over, the shouts of a state"
6227,V.,That hail a Columbus may name him great.
6228,V.,"Before it is over, that isle of the west,"
6229,V.,"The goal of his quest,"
6230,V.,"Is merely, for most, the point of a jest."
6231,V.,"Nor a few, the while he turns to his mission,"
6232,V.,Will deem him moved by a mean ambition.
6233,V.,"Ay, often indeed, the nobler the claims"
6234,V.,"Inspiring his aims,"
6235,V.,The more earth deems
6236,V.,They are selfish schemes
6237,V.,Of a Joseph it hates for having strange dreams.
6238,V.,
6239,V.,"Alas, where hate"
6240,V.,"Is a normal state,"
6241,V.,Who serves the world with a love that is great
6242,V.,"Is rated a foe by those who refuse it,"
6243,V.,Nor always a friend by those who use it;
6244,V.,"For he, forsooth, he knew of their need"
6245,V.,In the day they knew not how to succeed!—
6246,V.,"And thus this man in the marble wrought on,"
6247,V.,"Life’s fruit fell off, and the fall frost froze,"
6248,V.,"And the winter of life came, weary and wan,"
6249,V.,Ere words to welcome his worth arose.
6250,V.,"Wise world, the one who is now your boast"
6251,V.,"Heard few of your cheers, when needing them most:"
6252,V.,"The pride of his youth in his life or its plan,"

6254,V.,
6255,V.,
6256,VI.,VI.
6257,VI.,
6258,VI.,"But the monument grew, anon to display"
6259,VI.,"Above its foundation,"
6260,VI.,Those fair white sides that rose to their station
6261,VI.,All cunningly wrought into tablet and column.
6262,VI.,"Then children, and others, as childlike as they,"
6263,VI.,"Would delight in its beauty; but, doubtful and solemn,"
6264,VI.,The wise were all wary. “A man cannot rate
6265,VI.,"A work till complete,” said they, “so we must wait.”"
6266,VI.,
6267,VI.,
6268,VII.,VII.
6269,VII.,
6270,VII.,"And thus the man grew,"
6271,VII.,And thus did a few
6272,VII.,"Find, thoughtfully plann’d for the wants they divined,"
6273,VII.,His work that is now the pride of his kind.
6274,VII.,Who prized it at first?—
6275,VII.,"Ah, those little verst"
6276,VII.,In the codes that are current turn first from them all
6277,VII.,To the herald that comes to trump a new call.
6278,VII.,Those nearest their youth
6279,VII.,"Live nearest the breasts that glow with the truth,"
6280,VII.,And welcome it gratefully warm from the heart.
6281,VII.,"Earth’s elders and sages,"
6282,VII.,"Far off from the place where the springs all start,"
6283,VII.,Scarce ever can prize
6284,VII.,A stream that supplies
6285,VII.,A draft less far from its font than their age is.
6286,VII.,No deeds can course from as grand a source
6287,VII.,As the life of which they in their youth form’d a part.
6288,VII.,Naught sparkles as bright
6289,VII.,To them as the light
6290,VII.,"Of an old, cold, frozen, and crystallized art."
6291,VII.,"But, ah, if you ask them what was true"
6292,VII.,"When the words or the ways of their art were new,"
6293,VII.,If you ask them what were the traits it would show
6294,VII.,"Ere the form now frozen no longer could flow,"
6295,VII.,Or how it differ’d in nature from those
6296,VII.,"That spring in the present, when first it rose,—"
6297,VII.,All this their critic cares not to know.
6298,VII.,"He is nothing if not the dog of his day,"
6299,VII.,Who barks or who licks
6300,VII.,"As his master, the world, may make him obey"
6301,VII.,By throwing him bones or swinging him kicks.
6302,VII.,"Pray, what can he know till all the world know it!"
6303,VII.,If currents in view
6304,VII.,Are to crystallize too
6305,VII.,"Like things of the past, the winter will show it."
6306,VII.,The future must rate
6307,VII.,"The fruit of the present: so shrewd men wait,"
6308,VII.,And but of the dead
6309,VII.,Are their eulogies read.—
6310,VII.,"Good souls, they never will let one rest"
6311,VII.,Until he is borne to the land of the blest!
6312,VII.,No heart is aglow
6313,VII.,"With the burning zeal of a holiest mission,"
6314,VII.,"But makes them fearful of heat below,"
6315,VII.,And tremble in dread of a fiend’s apparition.
6316,VII.,"For Satan has toils that, no matter whether"
6317,VII.,"Come evil or good, trap all men together."
6318,VII.,Whenever one spies
6319,VII.,"Light coming, he cries,"
6320,VII.,“’Tis naught but a will-o-the-wisp to the wise.”
6321,VII.,"Half trust him, and half, not duped by his lies,"
6322,VII.,"Begin to dispute them; and then, at the quarrel,"
6323,VII.,The seer of the light has thorns for his laurel.
6324,VII.,
6325,VII.,"Ay, rare, indeed, in that day is his fate,"
6326,VII.,If the eye of the prophet—so noble a trait—
6327,VII.,Escape from censure and gibe and hate.
6328,VII.,For an eye like his will a goal pursue
6329,VII.,"So far in advance of his time and its view,"
6330,VII.,"That only the march of an age, forsooth,"
6331,VII.,Can o’ertake the vision he sees in his youth.
6332,VII.,"But, oh! in that age, when it comes, the earth"
6333,VII.,Will live in his light and know of his worth.
6334,VII.,And many and many will be the men
6335,VII.,"Who move on then,"
6336,VII.,And about them find
6337,VII.,"The scenes that he in his day divined,"
6338,VII.,"Who, sure of his presence, will know he is nigh,"
6339,VII.,"And feel he is leading, and never can die."
6340,VII.,This man of the monument lived like that.
6341,VII.,Men cheer him now; but of old they sat
6342,VII.,"In judgment against him; while, far away"
6343,VII.,"From the place where they had chosen to stay,"
6344,VII.,He push’d for the light; and grew old and hoar
6345,VII.,"Ere one whom he knew had begun to explore,"
6346,VII.,"Or seek what he sought. Alone in the van,"
6347,VII.,He had fail’d of aid had he thought it in man.

6355,VIII.,"The praise of the speaker, the shout of the throng,"
6356,VIII.,Throned white o’er the waving of plumes and of flags
6357,VIII.,That surge to its base as a sea to her crags.
6358,VIII.,"Now cheer we the monument, capp’d and clear’d,"

6365,IX.,"No doubt, in youth"

6367,IX.,At a smile from one who knew him in truth;
6368,IX.,"There were times, years later, when merely a tear"
6369,IX.,From a grateful eye
6370,IX.,Would have seem’d more dear
6371,IX.,Than all the glitter that gold could buy;
6372,IX.,"But, alas! in age, when character stands"
6373,IX.,"As fix’d as yon monument, then it demands,"
6374,IX.,"Ere aught can move it, far more, far more"
6375,IX.,Than the cheer or the sigh that had stirr’d it of yore.
6376,IX.,"Not oft, nor till ages of suns and storms"
6377,IX.,"Have wrought with the verdure in earthly forms,"
6378,IX.,"Are these turn’d into stone, no more to decay."
6379,IX.,But often on earth
6380,IX.,The owners of worth
6381,IX.,"That men image in marble grow stony, that way."
6382,IX.,"Ah, man, whom in hardship you might make a friend"
6383,IX.,"And turn from—beware, beware in the end,"
6384,IX.,Lest he whom you harden grow hard unto you.
6385,IX.,"O world, when ready your hero to cheer,"
6386,IX.,"How heeds he your welcome? say, what does he do?"
6387,IX.,"His eye, does it see? his ear, does it hear?"
6388,IX.,"His heart, does it throb? his pulse, does it thrill?"
6389,IX.,"Or his touch, is it cold? his clasp, is it chill?—"
6390,IX.,"O world, you have waited long; what have you done?"
6391,IX.,"O man, you have wrought so long; what have you won?—"

6407,XI.,"Had he learn’d that all life turns to seasons, and shifts"
6408,XI.,From winter and spring into summer and fall?
6409,XI.,"Or divined that eternity, balancing gifts,"
6410,XI.,"Grants honor like heaven, a state after strife,"
6411,XI.,And a glorified name to a sacrificed life?
6412,XI.,"Did he know that sighs, when yearning for love,"
6413,XI.,Best open the soul to breathe in from above
6414,XI.,"The air immortal, and make it worth while"
6415,XI.,That art should chisel in marble clear
6416,XI.,The lines divine that temper a smile
6417,XI.,Beyond the sway of a mortal’s cheer?—
6418,XI.,"Did he know it or not, perchance for his good"
6419,XI.,His work was lonely and misunderstood.
6420,XI.,"Perchance it was well, the best for the soul,"

8051,I.,When moulding all my methods to its own.
8052,I.,"Kept back from contact with rough boys at play,"
8053,I.,"Till sensitive and shrinking as a girl,"
8054,I.,A hint of their regard could master me;
8055,I.,"No maiden, dreaming of her wedding day,"
8056,I.,Could wake at morning with more trembling hopes
8057,I.,"Than I, when looking forward to my school."
8058,I.,"But when I reach’d it, not a Bluebeard more"
8059,I.,Could have disturb’d a trusting bride’s romance.
8060,I.,
8061,I.,
8062,II.,II.
8063,II.,
8064,II.,"At first, they lodged me there with such a loon!"
8065,II.,“Our clown!” so said the boys; and clown he was;
8066,II.,"Would tease all day, and tumble round all night;"
8067,II.,"And, every morning, sure as came the sun,"
8068,II.,"Would start and rout me out, with strap in hand,"
8069,II.,"Plied like a coach-whip round my dancing shape,"
8070,II.,Well put to blush until I dodged away.
8071,II.,
8072,II.,"A chum had Elbert too; and, like my own,"
8073,II.,"A wild boy caged, who seem’d more wild at times"
8074,II.,"Through beating at his bars, a hapless wretch."
8075,II.,"And when our happier love had flower’d in us,"
8076,II.,"Half pitying each other, half this chum,"
8077,II.,"Which pity grew, we both stood round, scarce loath"
8078,II.,To note his own wild set inflating him
8079,II.,With well-blown whims that swell’d his empty pride
8080,II.,"Forsooth, the better bubble he could be,"
8081,II.,The better hope we two could have of what
8082,II.,Should blow him from us. Then the blow came on:—
8083,II.,"A gust of scolding struck him, and he went,—"
8084,II.,"Obey’d the call that had been mouthed for him,—"
8085,II.,"An inn-clerk’s, as I think,—and bow’d content"
8086,II.,"To sink from view like Paul, one gloomy night,"
8087,II.,"From out the window of his room; while we,"
8088,II.,"Much giggling, flung his luggage after him."
8089,II.,
8090,II.,
8091,III.,III.
8092,III.,
8093,III.,"My friend, thus widow’d, caused that our school’s head,"
8094,III.,"Already nodding o’er his noonday pipe,"
8095,III.,"Should beck at sever’d dreams with one nod more,"
8096,III.,And so consent to our dreams.
8097,III.,"Room-mates made,"
8098,III.,We slamm’d his door and woke him; not ourselves.
8099,III.,"Our dreamland lasted, that is, when we two"
8100,III.,Were by ourselves. When more surrounded us—
8101,III.,"You know boy-friends are shy: is it a trait,"
8102,III.,"Their shielding of their hearts, that fits them thus"
8103,III.,For life-tilts of their manhood?—How we two
8104,III.,Would rasp each other when the world look’d on!
8105,III.,"In truth, each seem’d to wear his nature’s coat"
8106,III.,"The soft side inward, comforting himself,"
8107,III.,And turn the rough side only toward the world.
8108,III.,"If strangers chafed against it, yet oneself"
8109,III.,And friend were saved this.
8110,III.,
8111,III.,When thus Elbert’s cloak
8112,III.,"Was mine, and mine was his, and both held both,"
8113,III.,No proof could have convinced me in those days
8114,III.,His peer had ever liv’d. What seem’d in him
8115,III.,"So mild and beautiful, was more than marks"
8116,III.,Mere difference between a porcupine
8117,III.,Provok’d and peaceable. The kind was new;
8118,III.,"Not human, so angelic. Ay, that soul,"
8119,III.,"As pure as loving, and as fine as frank,"
8120,III.,"I half believe to-day, as I did then,"
8121,III.,Stood strange amid his comrades of the play
8122,III.,"As dogwood, wedded to the skies of spring,"
8123,III.,White in a wilderness of wintry pines.
8124,III.,"Ah me, could all find all on earth so dear,"
8125,III.,Christ’s work were common. I had died for him.
8126,III.,"In fact, to shield the rogue, I just escap’d"
8127,III.,"That very fate a score of times or more,"
8128,III.,"Bluft, bruis’d, and battling for him on the green."
8129,III.,
8130,III.,
8131,IV.,IV.
8132,IV.,
8133,IV.,Our love kept warm until our school-day-sun
8134,IV.,Had set; and afterwards the smouldering fires
8135,IV.,"Were fed by letters, and rekindl’d oft"
8136,IV.,By friction of a frequent intercourse
8137,IV.,"Through visits in vacations; then, for years,"
8138,IV.,Behind it there was left a lingering light
8139,IV.,Pervading moods of memory like the rays
8140,IV.,"Pour’d through a prism, wherein the commonest hues"
8141,IV.,Will spray to uncommon colors when they break.
8142,IV.,"In truth, I never see to-day a face"
8143,IV.,"Where flash the kindling feelings of a boy,"
8144,IV.,"But back of it, I seem to feel the warmth"
8145,IV.,Of Elbert’s heart. No school-boy past me bounds
8146,IV.,"But his dear presence comes to leap the years,"
8147,IV.,"And rush on recollection, with a force"
8148,IV.,"That brings from depths of joy, still’d long ago,"
8149,IV.,A spray as fresh as dash’d from them when first
8150,IV.,They stream’d in cataracts. With love like his
8151,IV.,"To flood its brim, my soul appear’d so full"
8152,IV.,"That, overflowing at each human touch,"
8153,IV.,Its pleasures could not stagnate.
8154,IV.,"But, you know"
8155,IV.,"How fly the clouds above us, and in drought"
8156,IV.,The old springs fail; and long we liv’d apart.
8157,IV.,
8158,IV.,
8159,V.,V.
8160,V.,
8161,V.,"Then Elbert, when we met, talk’d much of this:"
8162,V.,"How, all its chairs made vacant one by one,"
8163,V.,Th’ applause rose thinner at his bachelor-club;
8164,V.,"How, brief as birds’, are human mating-times;"
8165,V.,"How men, mere songs forgot, withdraw to nests—"
8166,V.,"To homes—their worlds, where all the sky is fill’d"
8167,V.,"With sunny smiles they love, and shadowy locks."
8168,V.,How sweet were life whose light and shade were these!
8169,V.,
8170,V.,"“We, Norman,” said he, “were contented once;"
8171,V.,To love each other only; but men part;
8172,V.,"And I confess that, while this light of love"
8173,V.,"Plays lambent round so many glowing lips,"
8174,V.,"I feel as chill, and lost, and out of place,"
8175,V.,"As one lone dew-drop, prison’d in a shade"
8176,V.,Of universal noon.”
8177,V.,"“The sun,” said I,"
8178,V.,"“Will free it, by and by. Our time will come.”"
8179,V.,
8180,V.,"“Must come,” replied he, “or I go to it."
8181,V.,"Henceforth, let beauty’s beams but gleam for me,"
8182,V.,"I shall not shun them, as has been my wont,"
8183,V.,"But make my eyes a sun-glass for my heart,"
8184,V.,And let them burn it.”
8185,V.,
8186,V.,"“May they burn,” I cried,"
8187,V.,“Until love’s fragrant opiate fume so strong
8188,V.,It make your brain beclouded as a Turk’s.
8189,V.,"But I, alas, though wild o’er many a maid,"
8190,V.,Am never mad enough to marry her.”
8191,V.,
8192,V.,"“You poets,” laugh’d he, “soar above earth so"
8193,V.,That common clouds like these can reach you not.
8194,V.,But why say ‘clouds’? for clouds rise o’er a flame
8195,V.,That smoulders. Love that burns is always clear.”
8196,V.,
8197,V.,"“But mine will not burn clearly, till it show"
8198,V.,"A woman,” said I, “fitted for a mate,"
8199,V.,"Whose mind, like yours, can really match my own."
8200,V.,"Till then must memory, jealous for her past,"
8201,V.,Out-do love’s hope that cannot promise more.”
8202,V.,
8203,V.,"“But maidens,” cried he, “are not loved like men."
8204,V.,"Bind beauty to their souls, then weigh the twain."
8205,V.,"If one weigh naught, he waives his judgment then."
8206,V.,We must be practical.”
8207,V.,
8208,V.,"Thus Elbert spoke,"
8209,V.,"While I, for whom these light and vapory moods"
8210,V.,"Had gather’d o’er that soul in slightest clouds,"
8211,V.,"Not tokening the storm that yet should burst,"
8212,V.,"Smiled only, thinking how, where throbb’d his heart,"
8213,V.,Some maid unnamed must surely stand and knock;
8214,V.,"Though this I had forgotten, save for that"
8215,V.,Which happen’d later. You shall hear of it.
8216,V.,
8217,V.,
8218,VI.,VI.
8219,VI.,
8220,VI.,"It came in Dresden, something like a year"
8221,VI.,More late than when my plan for life was changed.
8222,VI.,"The change seem’d sudden; but, you know, the blow"
8223,VI.,"That swept from me my parents, fortune, all,"
8224,VI.,"Could not but stun me, and I could not think."
8225,VI.,No other theme seem’d mine; I could not write.
8226,VI.,
8227,VI.,So came my change—no myth—I felt it all:—
8228,VI.,"One time, when, lonely, I to Christ had knelt,"
8229,VI.,"I rose to seem not lonely; I was His,"
8230,VI.,"He mine. I vow’d to live then but for Him,"
8231,VI.,"To break away from every cord of Earth,"
8232,VI.,And make my life accordant with his own.
8233,VI.,"Not only would I think the truth, but yield"
8234,VI.,"Each grain in all my being to the truth,"
8235,VI.,"And sow in wildest wastes, where all should germ"
8236,VI.,In generations growing toward the good.
8237,VI.,
8238,VI.,"But still, a novice yet, though, like St. Paul,"
8239,VI.,To will was present with me; to perform
8240,VI.,"I found not how; but, on performance bent,"
8241,VI.,"Within a chancel chanting with the choir,"
8242,VI.,"I stood before an altar, half the day,"
8243,VI.,"And half before my books, with cravings pale"
8244,VI.,For church and stole and sermons of my own.
8245,VI.,
8246,VI.,
8247,VII.,VII.
8248,VII.,
8249,VII.,Then was it Elbert’s friendship further’d me.
8250,VII.,"For finding me, and staring at my face,"
8251,VII.,"And books, and cassock—when the puzzle pass’d,—"
8252,VII.,"He, humbling to my humor, praised the priest"
8253,VII.,"And all the powers of priesthood, till delight"
8254,VII.,Relax’d the rigor of my rôle; and then
8255,VII.,He wedged the wisdom of his own desire
8256,VII.,"Within my dreams, and broke apart their spell,"
8257,VII.,"And drew aside the curtains of their couch,"
8258,VII.,"And spoke of dawn, and light for all the world."
8259,VII.,
8260,VII.,"“First learn about this world,” he urged, “and then"
8261,VII.,"Learn how to help it. Minds like mine,” he said,"
8262,VII.,"“Should teach, revise, reform, and start the thought"
8263,VII.,To counteract ill aim’d philosophy.
8264,VII.,Here loom’d an end worth reaching! which to reach
8265,VII.,’Twere well to cross the sea.—His purse was mine.
8266,VII.,"And go you as a student,” Elbert said,"
8267,VII.,"“Nor clad so like a priest, for whom all earth"
8268,VII.,Will don some Sabbath-day demean; go free
8269,VII.,"To find the man, hard by his work, at home.”"
8270,VII.,
8271,VII.,"Thus pleading many days, at last he won;"
8272,VII.,"And, yielding to his wish, the sea I cross’d."
8273,VII.,
8274,VII.,
8275,VIII.,VIII.
8276,VIII.,
8277,VIII.,"Soon, borne to Dresden for a leisure week,"
8278,VIII.,"With whom, one morning, should I chance to meet"
8279,VIII.,But Elbert’s elder sister?—now grown staid
8280,VIII.,"And matronly withal, a second wife,"
8281,VIII.,In charge of half a dozen sturdy boys;
8282,VIII.,"Though these I saw not then; but all alone,"
8283,VIII.,"Much flush’d and flurried, sweeping up the street,"
8284,VIII.,"She stopp’d, and cried abruptly, “Why, my friend,"
8285,VIII.,"Are you here, Norman?—you?—where from?—how long?"
8286,VIII.,"Not heard of you for years! That Elbert, drone,"
8287,VIII.,Will never write the news. How glad I am
8288,VIII.,To see a man on hand when needed once!
8289,VIII.,"Two girls, young friends of mine, just come to town,"
8290,VIII.,"Have lost their trunks,—and I my husband too,—"
8291,VIII.,And there they stand amid such throngs of men!—
8292,VIII.,"And did you note the statues in Berlin,"
8293,VIII.,"In all the streets?—of warriors, every one!"
8294,VIII.,"And these two girls, here travelling, by themselves,"
8295,VIII.,"Where might makes right, and woman slighted is,"
8296,VIII.,"Not strange it is their feelings toward you men,"
8297,VIII.,"In heat of indignation seething up,"
8298,VIII.,Should brew some barm at times of bitterness!”
8299,VIII.,
8300,VIII.,
8301,IX.,IX.
8302,IX.,
8303,IX.,"Thus, rattling on, she led me, as confused"
8304,IX.,"As feels a warrior at the morning drum,"
8305,IX.,"Till came a sight supreme, arousing me:—"
8306,IX.,"Two bright eyes only, sparkling in the light,"
8307,IX.,"Where flush’d a face that flared, then hid itself"
8308,IX.,"Behind a travelling hood, befleck’d with dust,"
8309,IX.,And fring’d with venturous locks of careless hair.
8310,IX.,
8311,IX.,“I have them now!” it cried; and straight began
8312,IX.,"A tale, strain’d sweeter through those lips aglow"
8313,IX.,"Than sunset music. Then, when all was told,"
8314,IX.,The name I heard was “Edith.”
8315,IX.,"Bowing low,"
8316,IX.,"“Well done!” essay’d I; then,—to bandy back"
8317,IX.,That charge against the men I just had heard
8318,IX.,"From her who brought me,—“Well done as a man!”"
8319,IX.,
8320,IX.,
8321,X.,X.
8322,X.,
8323,X.,"“That speech,” laugh’d she thus bandied, “scarce deserves"
8324,X.,"Our ‘Well done as a woman!’—Edith, hark,"
8325,X.,"His praise for you is, ‘Well done as a man!’”"
8326,X.,
8327,X.,"Then Edith, echoing after, naïvely dropt,"
8328,X.,“I tell you—nay—I will not say it though.”
8329,X.,
8330,X.,“Please do?” I ventur’d.
8331,X.,"“Nay; it may offend,”"
8332,X.,Replied she; while her shoulders gently shrugg’d
8333,X.,"As if to tempt me like two dainty doors,"
8334,X.,Doors all but swung ajar before a heart
8335,X.,That love was dared to enter!
8336,X.,"“Nay,” I said,"
8337,X.,“I vow you such a deal of patience now!”
8338,X.,
8339,X.,"“I do not know,” she answer’d; “am not sure."
8340,X.,Your manly patience might break loose to sigh
8341,X.,More hints about my manhood! Just to think
8342,X.,That half of all mankind are merely girls
8343,X.,And so must borrow all their tact from men!”
8344,X.,
8345,X.,"“Not so,” I said; “not so; but commonly.”—"
8346,X.,
8347,X.,"“Ah, commonly! and what,” she sigh’d, “is this"
8348,X.,That men-minds do so well?—discriminate?
8349,X.,"Yet even I, dull woman, I can see"
8350,X.,"Brains differ in their grain. But men, forsooth,"
8351,X.,Feel so much matter lodged in their brains—eh?—
8352,X.,"That they weigh mind like matter in the lump,"
8353,X.,"And judge of character, as if ’twere clay:—"
8354,X.,"This forms a man—has wisdom, firmness, power;"
8355,X.,"And that, a maid—is foolish, fickle, frail,"
8356,X.,"And never can be wholly safe, forsooth,"
8357,X.,"Except when subject to a man, her lord!”"
8358,X.,
8359,X.,"“Ah, but,” I said, “we men all prize you so!"
8360,X.,"To hold you ours, our pride seems infinite."
8361,X.,"Thus lifted up by you, it is your fault"
8362,X.,If we seem lords to you.”
8363,X.,"“Is it?” she ask’d,"
8364,X.,"“Or have you seem’d so long our lords, you think"
8365,X.,Your lording over us has trained in us
8366,X.,What still needs lording over? Fashion yields
8367,X.,"A man, at times, exemption from her forms,"
8368,X.,"But woman never. Wherefore, pray, is this?"
8369,X.,Do not they both have souls? and both aspire?
8370,X.,Must one class only slave it to her sex?—
8371,X.,I think the soul of woman as of man
8372,X.,May show some mastery over its abode.”
8373,X.,
8374,X.,"“But yet,” I said, “You know, her frame divine—"
8375,X.,"And soul, too—men confuse things—who can tell"
8376,X.,Which is the soul?”
8377,X.,
8378,X.,She answer’d absently:
8379,X.,"“In truth they do confuse things! only wise,"
8380,X.,As owls that blink at light!—so blind—nor see
8381,X.,What day dawns with a wife’s enfranchisement;
8382,X.,"Ambitious, but forgetting that the meek,"
8383,X.,"Inherit heaven, or that the oppressor dwarfs"
8384,X.,"His own surroundings; that if pride stoop not,"
8385,X.,"Then must the soul; that earthly lords must bend,"
8386,X.,"And lift their consorts to their own prized seats,"
8387,X.,"As equals, queens; or else must house with slaves,"
8388,X.,And make the slavish habits there their own.”
8389,X.,
8390,X.,
8391,XI.,XI.
8392,XI.,
8393,XI.,"“Well said!” I thought. “Disown it, though she may,"
8394,XI.,This maiden’s mood is manlier than she deems”;
8395,XI.,"And, as with manhood, so my wits went forth"
8396,XI.,To find a way to test her further still.
8397,XI.,
8398,XI.,"Just then the sister of Elbert, gesturing toward"
8399,XI.,"The sister of Edith, Alice, whom she fetch’d,"
8400,XI.,"Cried, half-way introducing us, “My fan!”"
8401,XI.,"I stoop’d, and pick’d it up. Then, bowing low,"
8402,XI.,"“Your humble slave,” I said. “You know, some claim"
8403,XI.,That genuine friends of either sex are slaves;
8404,XI.,"And only want of love would snatch a whip,"
8405,XI.,"And snapping it, cry out: ‘This way—serve me.’”"
8406,XI.,
8407,XI.,"“And I, like them,” said Edith, slightly flush’d,"
8408,XI.,“Seem wholly loveless. You may mourn it less
8409,XI.,"That yonder carriage waits me. For to-day,"
8410,XI.,All thanks for coming! We may meet once more.”
8411,XI.,
8412,XI.,
8413,XII.,XII.
8414,XII.,
8415,XII.,My face flamed hot as if its veil of flesh
8416,XII.,"Would burn, and bare the soul, to show I meant"
8417,XII.,"No rudeness. Elbert’s keen-eyed sister laugh’d,"
8418,XII.,"And, walking homeward then, kept bantering me,"
8419,XII.,"To storm my heart with courage womanly,"
8420,XII.,So sure that love of sex controls us all.
8421,XII.,“So fortunate!” she cried; “Heaven favor’d me.
8422,XII.,"They had no escort,—I no rival near;"
8423,XII.,And I must ply my arts this very eve.”
8424,XII.,
8425,XII.,"“Ah, but my plans!” I said;—“I leave to-day"
8426,XII.,For studies at Berlin.”
8427,XII.,
8428,XII.,"“Yes, yes; your plans!—"
8429,XII.,"You serve ideals, like all idiots."
8430,XII.,"But you are more, much more, than out your teens;"
8431,XII.,"And—well, you are no hermit, any way.”"
8432,XII.,
8433,XII.,"“Then must I find”—I laugh’d, yet half in earnest—"
8434,XII.,“The charms to tempt me!” and my reckoning
8435,XII.,Fill’d all my fingers doubly with the traits
8436,XII.,Of perfect womanhood.
8437,XII.,"“She owns,” I heard,"
8438,XII.,"“All these, and more. For once, my poet, dream;"
8439,XII.,And full Elysium waits you when you wake.
8440,XII.,"But mind you, Norman, maids of Edith’s kind,"
8441,XII.,In whose one person love so womanly
8442,XII.,"With intellect so manly has been join’d,"
8443,XII.,Need not to marry for a hand or head.
8444,XII.,"There, hearts alone can win. Bear this in mind;"
8445,XII.,"And fan your fancy till your words grow warm,"
8446,XII.,"Ay, glow to flash the white heat of the soul!”"
8447,XII.,"Then, crying from her door, “Farewell till eve,”"
8448,XII.,"True to her sex, unanswer’d yet assured,"
8449,XII.,The woman left.
8450,XII.,
8451,XII.,
8452,XIII.,XIII.
8453,XIII.,
8454,XIII.,"And so my will was caught,"
8455,XIII.,"The net so deftly drawn, I flounder’d first,"
8456,XIII.,"Then, resting, smiled. We fight the hydra, we,"
8457,XIII.,Who war against our nature. Every head
8458,XIII.,That reason clove would rise redoubled there.
8459,XIII.,"Forsooth, my rudeness:—that should be explain’d;"
8460,XIII.,For which a single visit would suffice;
8461,XIII.,"And this, for scarce a day, need check my work;"
8462,XIII.,"Or, if I linger’d longer, all my life"
8463,XIII.,Lay still before me. Wherefore haste away?
8464,XIII.,"Fate might be beckoning!—“Nay, I should not leave,”"
8465,XIII.,"Sigh’d hope, too warm, at last, by more than half;"
8466,XIII.,"Then roused sweet echoes of faint hints, recall’d"
8467,XIII.,"From churchly sources, of one’s need to wed,"
8468,XIII.,"If he would work the best, for all, with all."
8469,XIII.,"Thus, like two cowards, clinging each to each,"
8470,XIII.,"Weak wish nudged wisdom, and weak wisdom wish."
8471,XIII.,Who gets on better?
8472,XIII.,
8473,XIII.,
8474,XIV.,XIV.
8475,XIV.,
8476,XIV.,So that night we went.
8477,XIV.,"And, all the way, my gay guide rail’d at me."
8478,XIV.,"“Aha, my bachelor, your roving love,"
8479,XIV.,"Aha, has had its day! Yon sunset hues"
8480,XIV.,But deck the curtains hung before its night.”
8481,XIV.,
8482,XIV.,"“Alas,” I cried, “if I must through them pass,"
8483,XIV.,"Woe me who wish it! See, in front of them,"
8484,XIV.,The river in the horizon underneath—”
8485,XIV.,"“Your Jordan, ere your promis’d land!” she said;"
8486,XIV.,“You need baptizing for your harden’d heart.”
8487,XIV.,
8488,XIV.,"“Ah me!” I sigh’d, yet strangely; for there seem’d,"
8489,XIV.,"While all the way the twilight thicker sank,"
8490,XIV.,Sweet silence luring dreamward wind and bird
8491,XIV.,Until the reverent air lay hush’d where came
8492,XIV.,The hallowing influence of holier stars.
8493,XIV.,"And, all the way, deep folding round my soul,"
8494,XIV.,"With every nerve vibrating at its touch,"
8495,XIV.,"Fell dim delight, through which, as through a veil,"
8496,XIV.,Some nearer presence breath’d of holier life.
8497,XIV.,"Ah, wandering Heart, and had I had my day?—"
8498,XIV.,With closing gates as golden as yon west?
8499,XIV.,And whither was I moving in the dark?—
8500,XIV.,"“Who knows?” my spirit ask’d, “who knows or cares?"
8501,XIV.,"On through the twilight threshold, trustingly!"
8502,XIV.,"What halt thou, Night, that weary souls need fear?"
8503,XIV.,"Thou home of love entranced, thou haunt of dreams,"
8504,XIV.,Thy halls alone can hoard the truth of heaven!
8505,XIV.,Thy dome alone can rise to reach the stars!”
8506,XIV.,
8507,XIV.,
8508,XV.,XV.
8509,XV.,
8510,XV.,"She roused me, crying out, “Look toward the porch!”"
8511,XV.,"I look’d, and there beheld our waiting friends,"
8512,XV.,"And, grouped with them, some ruddy German maids"
8513,XV.,Whose deeper hues but finely rimmed with shade
8514,XV.,The subtler beauty of our special hosts.
8515,XV.,"These came from out that western world wherein,"
8516,XV.,"By fresher breezes and by brighter suns,"
8517,XV.,"The Saxon tissue, sweeten’d and refined,"
8518,XV.,"Unfolds, each season, more ethereally."
8519,XV.,
8520,XV.,"The two then moving from their sister-maids,"
8521,XV.,"Like petals loos’d from roses when in bloom,"
8522,XV.,"Came forth to welcome us; and, greetings o’er,"
8523,XV.,"Of Europe, Edith spoke, and Germany,"
8524,XV.,"And books, and music—how the church of Greece"
8525,XV.,Had carved earth’s pivot that earth whirls upon
8526,XV.,Within the centre of a flag-stone round
8527,XV.,That paves a chapel in Jerusalem.
8528,XV.,"But she, who track’d that viewless whirl by sound,"
8529,XV.,"And deem’d all harmony to centre here,"
8530,XV.,"A Grecian only in her love of art,"
8531,XV.,Had found that pivot fix’d in Germany.
8532,XV.,
8533,XV.,
8534,XVI.,XVI.
8535,XVI.,
8536,XVI.,"“True Grecian, she!” the sister of Elbert cried;"
8537,XVI.,"“Each morning brings her fresh from shrines of art,"
8538,XVI.,"All flush’d, a priestess from an oracle,"
8539,XVI.,To sanctify us grosser mortals here
8540,XVI.,With vague suggestions! mutter’d mysteries!
8541,XVI.,"Ah me, to hear her rave once!”"
8542,XVI.,"Edith smiled,"
8543,XVI.,“And eyes that see are blest!—and which sees most—
8544,XVI.,"My worship, or your wonder? Know you, friend,”"
8545,XVI.,"She turn’d to me and asked,—“this critic’s ground?—"
8546,XVI.,"The Sistine Babe it was, we spoke of Him."
8547,XVI.,"Because I find art’s glass, when rightly held,"
8548,XVI.,"Revealing through the real the truth ideal,"
8549,XVI.,"I said: ‘I seem to see not only Him,"
8550,XVI.,"The Babe, but back of Him, His heavenly home."
8551,XVI.,"I seem to enter this—His handmaid there,"
8552,XVI.,And there commune until my soul is blest.’
8553,XVI.,"I said: ‘From thence my spirit seems to come,"
8554,XVI.,And feel its arms to be the throne of Christ.
8555,XVI.,"And this,’ I said, ‘is wrought for me by art."
8556,XVI.,"Some hold that souls transmigrate after death,"
8557,XVI.,"But art,’ I said, ‘makes mine transmigrate here.’"
8558,XVI.,For this you hear of raving. Do I err?
8559,XVI.,"The soul of feeling is in thought, not so?"
8560,XVI.,"Then one, to feel refresh’d, must think she bathes"
8561,XVI.,In rills that reach her from the freshest springs.”
8562,XVI.,
8563,XVI.,
8564,XVII.,XVII.
8565,XVII.,
8566,XVII.,"“Ah,” said the sister of Elbert, soothingly,"
8567,XVII.,“Our soaring lark here bathes in each bright pool.
8568,XVII.,So be not frighten’d off; her plumes but shake
8569,XVII.,A sprinkling from the bath they had to-day.”
8570,XVII.,
8571,XVII.,"“Some please the world,” said Edith; “I, myself,—"
8572,XVII.,"My soul, I mean; nor long to clip that soul"
8573,XVII.,"To suit mere worldling’s notions. Courting crowds,"
8574,XVII.,"A soul lives crampt; but if one speak the truth,"
8575,XVII.,Crowds leave—good riddance!—place is clear’d for friends.”
8576,XVII.,
8577,XVII.,"“Clear’d verily!” her sister cried, “Long live"
8578,XVII.,"These household pet-gods of our modern homes,"
8579,XVII.,Like sprites to fright the stranger off! Now own
8580,XVII.,The fear you felt. It would appease her so!”
8581,XVII.,
8582,XVII.,
8583,XVIII.,XVIII.
8584,XVIII.,
8585,XVIII.,To this rose no reply to Edith’s lips.
8586,XVIII.,"I mark’d, instead, a gentle trembling there,"
8587,XVIII.,Like ripples roused upon a tranquil sea
8588,XVIII.,"That rise from deep, unseen disturbances."
8589,XVIII.,"“They fail to read her rightly,” thought I, then—"
8590,XVIII.,"You know no man can flinch it: woman’s grief,"
8591,XVIII.,"If there be any manhood left in him,"
8592,XVIII.,Will rouse his efforts to bespeak her peace—
8593,XVIII.,I found myself her soul’s expositor
8594,XVIII.,To clear the channel of its overflow.
8595,XVIII.,
8596,XVIII.,"“And when the thought is in one, when it springs,"
8597,XVIII.,"Why, then, not let it spring? The world is not"
8598,XVIII.,So fill’d with thoughts that it can spare our own.
8599,XVIII.,"And if we startle folks, jog off the guise"
8600,XVIII.,"Of their deceit, we spy them as they are."
8601,XVIII.,"Between souls thus discover’d, Edith deems"
8602,XVIII.,That love must flow; while friendship caught by craft
8603,XVIII.,Is lost by confidence. I think her right.
8604,XVIII.,Why not? We all when in our noblest moods
8605,XVIII.,Crave homage for our souls’ nobility.
8606,XVIII.,"But what our souls are in themselves, who know,"
8607,XVIII.,Save as our rôles report us outwardly?
8608,XVIII.,Did not divine hands form us as we are?
8609,XVIII.,"Who love us as we are, love higher things"
8610,XVIII.,Than those who love what earth would make of us.”
8611,XVIII.,
8612,XVIII.,"“My champion!” Edith cried; and waved her thanks,"
8613,XVIII.,With white sleeves fluttering from her shapely sides—
8614,XVIII.,"Ah me, a wing’d one sent to save my soul"
8615,XVIII.,Had scarcely stirr’d in me a greater joy.
8616,XVIII.,
8617,XVIII.,
8618,XIX.,XIX.
8619,XIX.,
8620,XIX.,"My mien must have reveal’d it. Like a lake,"
8621,XIX.,"Whose fogs unfold, when comes a genial sun,"
8622,XIX.,Her moods unfolded to my sympathy;
8623,XIX.,"And, brightly imaged in her nature’s depths,"
8624,XIX.,"I seem’d, at every turn, to face my own."
8625,XIX.,
8626,XIX.,"So new to me such views were, that I felt"
8627,XIX.,"As thrill’d as feels the savage maid, when first"
8628,XIX.,"She finds her own face in a stranger’s glass,"
8629,XIX.,"Then spell-bound lingers, learning of herself."
8630,XIX.,"So wrapt, my wonder hung, all wistfully,"
8631,XIX.,About that spirit bright. What meant it all?
8632,XIX.,"I could not then believe,—I scout it yet,—"
8633,XIX.,That mortals can afford to slight the souls
8634,XIX.,"Reflecting theirs, who make them mind themselves"
8635,XIX.,"And prize the good they own, and dread the ill."
8636,XIX.,
8637,XIX.,"You smile, friend: yes; and often so would I."
8638,XIX.,"My head would oft, made jealous of my heart,"
8639,XIX.,Deny that reason ruled my impulses.
8640,XIX.,"And oft my heart, to bear such weight of joy,"
8641,XIX.,Would faint from too much feeling. I would ask
8642,XIX.,Could I be sane yet find my life so sweet?—
8643,XIX.,At least I would be sure; so like a friend
8644,XIX.,"Who finds a long-lost friend amid a crowd,"
8645,XIX.,"And stares, and holds him at arm’s length, a time,"
8646,XIX.,Ere clasping him with courage to his breast
8647,XIX.,"That wellnigh bursts the while, I held her off,"
8648,XIX.,This long-sought soul that mine had found a friend;
8649,XIX.,And did not dare to trust her as I would.
8650,XIX.,
8651,XIX.,
8652,XX.,XX.
8653,XX.,
8654,XX.,"What struggles then were mine! Too cautious grown,"
8655,XX.,"To dare to risk a fall, though but in love,"
8656,XX.,How would I brace my powers against her charms
8657,XX.,"That might unbalance me! How would my will,"
8658,XX.,"That strove to master my reluctant mien,"
8659,XX.,"Make stiff my every smile! or, were my heart"
8660,XX.,"Too strong to be suppress’d, how would I thwart"
8661,XX.,And turn each glance that could reveal one glimpse
8662,XX.,"Of how I loved her, toward her sister first!"
8663,XX.,"Unconscious Edith,—could she read deceit?—"
8664,XX.,"’Twas all I dared to use. How could I else,"
8665,XX.,"Poor fool, that then I felt myself to be,"
8666,XX.,Hide my infatuation!
8667,XX.,
8668,XX.,
8669,XXI.,XXI.
8670,XXI.,
8671,XXI.,What of her?—
8672,XXI.,How could she know me when a mask I wore?
8673,XXI.,"Was not her sister pleased, when pleasing me?"
8674,XXI.,"Did Edith not please me, when pleasing her?"
8675,XXI.,And so for Alice only seem’d her care;
8676,XXI.,"And Alice was a fair and flippant naught,"
8677,XXI.,An empty echo only of my love.
8678,XXI.,The sweetness of the family all had gone
8679,XXI.,To fill the elder Edith.
8680,XXI.,"Then alas,"
8681,XXI.,"Too late, I learn’d my error. How I chafed,"
8682,XXI.,Kept back from midnight strolls for sake of Alice!
8683,XXI.,And jogg’d from tête-a-têtes to give her place!
8684,XXI.,"Then with her left, inspired alone to wish"
8685,XXI.,To be like her a dunce; and thus to be
8686,XXI.,"Like her, in some way, Edith’s all-in-all."
8687,XXI.,
8688,XXI.,
8689,XXII.,XXII.
8690,XXII.,
8691,XXII.,Nor could I hint this truth to Edith; nay.
8692,XXII.,"Unselfish, all ethereal in her thought,"
8693,XXII.,A disembodied soul had held less moods
8694,XXII.,Touch’d through the senses. One had sooner snared
8695,XXII.,"With tatter’d nets of tow a wind of spring,"
8696,XXII.,Or with his own breath warm’d the wintry air.
8697,XXII.,Her love’s regard in no way could be reach’d.
8698,XXII.,"At times, I would essay philosophy,"
8699,XXII.,Or try to freight her fancy’s wings with facts.
8700,XXII.,"Like merest sand, flung off a nervous bird,"
8701,XXII.,My pleas were shaken back.
8702,XXII.,"She “There,” would cry;"
8703,XXII.,“Some everlasting everybody’s law
8704,XXII.,"Applied again to me! Nay, nay, this world"
8705,XXII.,Would grind one’s very soul to common dust!”
8706,XXII.,
8707,XXII.,
8708,XXIII.,XXIII.
8709,XXIII.,
8710,XXIII.,“And what else are we?” turn’d I once to ask;
8711,XXIII.,“Would God we all could free ourselves from laws;
8712,XXIII.,But half our lives we spend in learning them;
8713,XXIII.,And half in learning how to love them then.
8714,XXIII.,"And but in souls that learn life’s laws by heart,"
8715,XXIII.,"Has wisdom, so it seems, a sway complete.”"
8716,XXIII.,
8717,XXIII.,"“’Tis thus with earthly wisdom,” she rejoin’d;"
8718,XXIII.,"“But earth is ruled by folly,—idiot child"
8719,XXIII.,Of freedom fetter’d. You may live the slave;
8720,XXIII.,But I choose freedom!”
8721,XXIII.,
8722,XXIII.,"And, as then she left,"
8723,XXIII.,"“You lawless,” thought I, “will you always prove"
8724,XXIII.,"The water Undine of my wilderness,"
8725,XXIII.,"All maddening, with strange metamorphoses,"
8726,XXIII.,My faint love thirsting to refresh itself?”—
8727,XXIII.,
8728,XXIII.,
8729,XXIV.,XXIV.
8730,XXIV.,
8731,XXIV.,"Oft while I this would moot, she changed, and seem’d"
8732,XXIV.,"A fount of laughter now that sprang within,"
8733,XXIV.,"O’er-rill’d her lips and rippled round her guise,"
8734,XXIV.,The very train’s hem shaken by the flow.
8735,XXIV.,"“Nay, nay, but I shall trust you yet,” I thought;"
8736,XXIV.,"“And still believe you good, and hold it true"
8737,XXIV.,"That maids, like minnows, rarely show themselves"
8738,XXIV.,"Till, caught and drawn from out the open sea,"
8739,XXIV.,They frisk in safety in some household pond!”
8740,XXIV.,
8741,XXIV.,"Like this, my moods moved on,—life’s usual way,"
8742,XXIV.,"The mainspring sped by balanced contraries,"
8743,XXIV.,"And every pulse, whose beating proves we live,"
8744,XXIV.,Anon with deathlike voids alternating.
8745,XXIV.,"One hour, my faith in her was like the sun,"
8746,XXIV.,"The next, my doubt was lightless as the night."
8747,XXIV.,All prefaced fitly that which you shall hear.
8748,XXIV.,
8749,XXIV.,
8750,XXV.,XXV.
8751,XXV.,
8752,XXV.,"I, once, recurring to my youth, had said"
8753,XXV.,"Of Elbert, that he soon, fulfilling plans"
8754,XXV.,"Long form’d, would join me here in Germany."
8755,XXV.,
8756,XXV.,"“Why,” Alice cried, “to think you know so well"
8757,XXV.,Our Elbert!”
8758,XXV.,“Yours?” I ask’d.
8759,XXV.,"“Ours,” Edith said,"
8760,XXV.,"“Ay, ay; our families have been friends for years.”"
8761,XXV.,"But spite her careless tone, her eyes appear’d,"
8762,XXV.,"Slipping through lashes long, to shun my own."
8763,XXV.,
8764,XXV.,"And why was this?—And why, too, had she flush’d?—"
8765,XXV.,What subtle weapon had been used to cut
8766,XXV.,"Beneath the surface of her mien, and bring"
8767,XXV.,The heart-blood from its core?
8768,XXV.,Then I recall’d
8769,XXV.,"How Elbert’s moods, of late, had hid themselves"
8770,XXV.,In strange far mists of fancy.—Could it be
8771,XXV.,"That Edith, she was his?—And he, my friend,"
8772,XXV.,"Was he the one then that had caged her love,"
8773,XXV.,And placed it where my soul in reaching forth
8774,XXV.,Could sense but bars of chill indifference?—
8775,XXV.,I could not ask her nor her sister this;
8776,XXV.,"Nor even Elbert’s now, for in the week"
8777,XXV.,"When first I met her, she had sail’d for home."
8778,XXV.,"But soon, like worms that would not wait for death,"
8779,XXV.,Fear-fretted jealousies clung round the form
8780,XXV.,"Of dying hope that now prized Edith more,"
8781,XXV.,To feel that Elbert too had prized her so.
8782,XXV.,
8783,XXV.,
8784,XXVI.,XXVI.
8785,XXVI.,
8786,XXVI.,"A few days later, as we sat and talk’d,"
8787,XXVI.,"He on us burst, and brought a sudden light"
8788,XXVI.,"Illuminating her, and paling me,"
8789,XXVI.,"Blanch’d, ash-like, in the flame of that hot flush"
8790,XXVI.,That warm’d her welcome. All my heart and breath
8791,XXVI.,Seem’d sunk in silence like the buzzing bees
8792,XXVI.,"When autumn steals the sunlight from the flowers,"
8793,XXVI.,And frost seals down their sweets. I heard them talk
8794,XXVI.,Like one who just has walk’d a glacier path
8795,XXVI.,"With boist’rous friends; then, stumbling, slips away,"
8796,XXVI.,"Far suck’d through freezing fathoms down to death,"
8797,XXVI.,Yet hears the cruel laughter crackling still.
8798,XXVI.,
8799,XXVI.,
8800,XXVII.,XXVII.
8801,XXVII.,
8802,XXVII.,"This hardly tuned my mood for Elbert’s glee,"
8803,XXVII.,"When then we left the sisters. “Ah, good friend,"
8804,XXVII.,"So glad to see you! Such a desert, life!"
8805,XXVII.,"And friendship, such an oasis!—Your health!"
8806,XXVII.,"Our dusty throats need clearing first, and then"
8807,XXVII.,Shall drafts drawn deeper clear our dusty souls.”
8808,XXVII.,
8809,XXVII.,"Thus led he, hurrying on from thought to thought,"
8810,XXVII.,Yet not one breath for Edith could he spare.—
8811,XXVII.,Why not? Could he not trust my friendship yet?
8812,XXVII.,"Half anxious then, half curious to detect,"
8813,XXVII.,"Though wary still of love so subtly hid,"
8814,XXVII.,"My lips, bold-braced yet trembling at the deed,"
8815,XXVII.,"Essay’d a note to touch him,—Edith’s praise."
8816,XXVII.,
8817,XXVII.,
8818,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
8819,XXVIII.,
8820,XXVIII.,"“She looks well,” said he, somewhat absently."
8821,XXVIII.,"“She looks well!” cried I, half-way nettled now;"
8822,XXVIII.,"Should Edith be abused, forsooth, to show"
8823,XXVIII.,What brutes men are who lose their trust! “She looks—
8824,XXVIII.,"For what then do you take her? for a frame,"
8825,XXVIII.,"An empty effigy of human shape,"
8826,XXVIII.,Like what a shopman hangs his gowns upon?—
8827,XXVIII.,"Her soul is what I spoke of,—of her soul.”"
8828,XXVIII.,
8829,XXVIII.,"“Her soul?” he said; “may be; but I, may be,"
8830,XXVIII.,Have never seen it.”
8831,XXVIII.,"“How?—this too!” I thought,"
8832,XXVIII.,“A slight is it?—or triumph that he vaunts?”
8833,XXVIII.,
8834,XXVIII.,"He caught my feeling from my fever’d mien,"
8835,XXVIII.,"And words confused and few; and, warming then,"
8836,XXVIII.,"Made answer: “Norman, if I loved you less,"
8837,XXVIII.,"I more might love, and more might spare myself."
8838,XXVIII.,"The thing my sister wrote, I deemed her whim;"
8839,XXVIII.,"Could not conceive it true, yet can it be?—"
8840,XXVIII.,"I swear, it staggers half one’s faith to find"
8841,XXVIII.,"A man, devoted to the aims you claim,"
8842,XXVIII.,So little circumspect.”
8843,XXVIII.,What meant he now?
8844,XXVIII.,Could he believe that I had form’d a plan
8845,XXVIII.,"To woo his Edith, knowing she was his?—"
8846,XXVIII.,"And could my sleepless nights, my troubled heart,"
8847,XXVIII.,"My prayerful deeds, my nature that he knew,"
8848,XXVIII.,"Be so misjudged, without some fault in him?—"
8849,XXVIII.,“So little circumspect in what?” I ask’d.
8850,XXVIII.,
8851,XXVIII.,"And then with words that could but anger me,"
8852,XXVIII.,“In what but choice of company?” he said;
8853,XXVIII.,"“No more you think of study, duty, church,"
8854,XXVIII.,But waste the whole day long with one like this!—
8855,XXVIII.,"Nay, check me not. I understand my words.—"
8856,XXVIII.,"This actress, though right artless in her way,"
8857,XXVIII.,"This actress here, would play”—"
8858,XXVIII.,“With me!” I cried;
8859,XXVIII.,“This ‘actress!’” and I know not what I said;
8860,XXVIII.,"But yet recall what kept him forcing in,"
8861,XXVIII.,“You err!”—“You do me wrong!”—“You know her not!”—
8862,XXVIII.,"Wild words, the which he ended, saying then:"
8863,XXVIII.,“Not such am I as you profess to be;
8864,XXVIII.,"But had you common-sense, no piety,"
8865,XXVIII.,"You might perceive a farce, if not a fault:"
8866,XXVIII.,"A broad church yours will be then, when your mate,"
8867,XXVIII.,"Attracting toward the stage by charms you lack,"
8868,XXVIII.,"Will draw the sinner, while you draw the saint.”"
8869,XXVIII.,
8870,XXVIII.,
8871,XXIX.,XXIX.
8872,XXIX.,
8873,XXIX.,"Struck blind, I scarcely could have felt more stunn’d."
8874,XXIX.,Was this the truth? An actress would she be?
8875,XXIX.,Why had that sister of his not told me this?—
8876,XXIX.,
8877,XXIX.,“Not told you this?” cried Elbert; “What? not told?
8878,XXIX.,"Ay, ay, I see.—She hoped that love, perchance—"
8879,XXIX.,It is a woman’s balm for every ill—
8880,XXIX.,Might woo this Edith from her present life.
8881,XXIX.,She knows her not.—And you—have you told her?—
8882,XXIX.,Does Edith know your plans?”
8883,XXIX.,“She must have known”—
8884,XXIX.,I answer’d back; and then I check’d myself.
8885,XXIX.,Did not she blush to hear that Elbert came?—
8886,XXIX.,"For fear was it, lest he should tell the truth?—"
8887,XXIX.,"To me, her friend? to me, deceived, her dupe?"
8888,XXIX.,"To me, whose love she might have known, yet knew"
8889,XXIX.,That all that she had seem’d was not her all?—
8890,XXIX.,"If she had meant deception, could my love"
8891,XXIX.,Survive the test?
8892,XXIX.,"Those watching death-beds, mark"
8893,XXIX.,"That souls, when dying, ere above they spring,"
8894,XXIX.,"Breathe deep, then pass away. And so with minds,"
8895,XXIX.,"When come the deadliest woes. Down deep in thought,"
8896,XXIX.,I scarce had deem’d that aught from hell could roil
8897,XXIX.,Such dregs of bitterness long undisturb’d.

8902,XXX.,"The fault, sigh’d conscience, had been all my own:"
8903,XXX.,How safely might one sail the sea of life
8904,XXX.,If all his reckonings were but true to heaven!
8905,XXX.,"Ah, siren-like, a rivalling earthly love"
8906,XXX.,"May lure to realms whose mountain heights are clouds,"
8907,XXX.,"Clouds warmly hued above a cold gray shoal,"
8908,XXX.,"Whose only outlines are the breakers’ caps,"
8909,XXX.,"Whose only stir, the fury of the storm."
8910,XXX.,
8911,XXX.,"And I, who now had learn’d the truth, what now?—"
8912,XXX.,Should I turn back to aims I knew were safe?—
8913,XXX.,I swore to do it; yet I thought—and thrill’d—
8914,XXX.,"Could I but hold her soul, but own herself,"
8915,XXX.,"Though all things else were lost, this gain were sweet!—"
8916,XXX.,"Were sweet, though all were lost? Why need this be?"
8917,XXX.,All might be saved. Did I believe in God?—
8918,XXX.,That he could change a life through human means?
8919,XXX.,Might not her life be chang’d then?—What were I
8920,XXX.,"But faithless wholly, did I try this not?"
8921,XXX.,
8922,XXX.,
8923,XXXI.,XXXI.
8924,XXXI.,
8925,XXXI.,"So, soon, to draw her thoughts out, baiting mine,"
8926,XXXI.,"Some slur I dropt, suggested by a church:"
8927,XXXI.,"It touch’d a theatre. “Extremes,” I said,"
8928,XXXI.,“Have met.”
8929,XXXI.,"“Extremes have met,” she said, “before!"
8930,XXXI.,I take your meaning. Elbert has disclosed—
8931,XXXI.,"Not what I am, but what I seem to be"
8932,XXXI.,To those who will not view me as I am.
8933,XXXI.,You join their lists?—I hoped for better things.”
8934,XXXI.,
8935,XXXI.,“But was it right to keep me ignorant?”
8936,XXXI.,
8937,XXXI.,"“I hoped it right,” she said, “to keep you wise."
8938,XXXI.,"What Elbert thought, I knew. With you, had hopes,"
8939,XXXI.,That she who might not seem so wholly wrong
8940,XXXI.,"Might better represent a class unknown,—”"
8941,XXXI.,
8942,XXXI.,"“Without design, might represent amiss,”"
8943,XXXI.,"I answer’d. “As for you, however class’d,"
8944,XXXI.,"I fear no class could claim you, all in all."
8945,XXXI.,For all rules have exceptions.”
8946,XXXI.,“Take but rules
8947,XXXI.,"For this time,” said she. “Did you ever find"
8948,XXXI.,"That ever, when the seers look forth through heaven,"
8949,XXXI.,"They view there pews and pulpits?—Nay, not so:"
8950,XXXI.,"Yet oft they note a stage and galleries,"
8951,XXXI.,All throng’d with white-robed hosts attendant there.
8952,XXXI.,"So these, you see, at times may hint of good.”"
8953,XXXI.,
8954,XXXI.,"“They may,” I said, “but do they, as a rule?”"
8955,XXXI.,
8956,XXXI.,"“Ah, as a rule,” she said, “they hint of life—”"
8957,XXXI.,
8958,XXXI.,"“But mainly life to laugh at or to fear,”"
8959,XXXI.,I answer’d.
8960,XXXI.,"“When emotion swells and shrinks,"
8961,XXXI.,"The spirit’s wings are moving,” she replied."
8962,XXXI.,"“And that art moves them most, which mirrors most"
8963,XXXI.,"The life that is, and therefore is the truth."
8964,XXXI.,So often have I heard my father say:
8965,XXXI.,‘We read of truth who spell from nature’s page;
8966,XXXI.,And art can best make out the meanings there;
8967,XXXI.,For ’tis the artist’s thought that finds each form
8968,XXXI.,"A form of thought,—imagination’s glass"
8969,XXXI.,That views the infinite in the finite fact.
8970,XXXI.,"Here moves a man, you say. What see you?—man?—"
8971,XXXI.,"Nay, nay; that guise material fashions there"
8972,XXXI.,The image only of his manliness.
8973,XXXI.,"And you can only know his life within,"
8974,XXXI.,As from the image you imagine it.
8975,XXXI.,"Yon little girl that skips beside the porch,—"
8976,XXXI.,"I know her, love her, not, save as I pass"
8977,XXXI.,Behind that face to reach a region rare
8978,XXXI.,"Where dolls are sentient babes, and brothers kings."
8979,XXXI.,"And yonder maidens, musing in delight,"
8980,XXXI.,"I know not, love not, till, in sacrifice,"
8981,XXXI.,"My spirit seems to yield to their desires,"
8982,XXXI.,"To wait a watchful servant unto them,"
8983,XXXI.,"To move with motives that inspire their deeds,"
8984,XXXI.,"To look through their own eyes and see their views,"
8985,XXXI.,And thrill with rhythm when their ear-drums throb;
8986,XXXI.,"Then, joining all with all, imagine thus"
8987,XXXI.,The movements of their hidden inner moods.
8988,XXXI.,"Thus too, through all of life, how know we more?"
8989,XXXI.,"All things are fitful images alone,"
8990,XXXI.,Reflecting glory from the Absolute;
8991,XXXI.,And he who can imagine from the part
8992,XXXI.,"What marks the whole, walks in the light of heaven."
8993,XXXI.,Find then a life where every child becomes
8994,XXXI.,"Earth’s animated toy of manliness,"
8995,XXXI.,"Each man the mass from which to mould a god,"
8996,XXXI.,"And earth the pit whence all heaven’s wealth is mined,"
8997,XXXI.,"You find for thought a life worth living for,"
8998,XXXI.,A life the artist gives us: it is he
8999,XXXI.,"Discerns a spirit always veil’d in shape,"
9000,XXXI.,"A soul in man, and reason everywhere.’”"

9004,XXXII.,
9005,XXXII.,"Ah, Edith, so I mused, an artist thou,"
9006,XXXII.,"Thou art indeed! but not an actress, no,"
9007,XXXII.,"Whatever may have train’d thee, save to tread"
9008,XXXII.,The stage of truth! and Elbert’s every act
9009,XXXII.,Against my flinty confidence in her
9010,XXXII.,"Struck fire and flash’d, each time I met him now;"
9011,XXXII.,"The more so, that each time I met him now,"
9012,XXXII.,"In earnest, or to stir me to distrust,"
9013,XXXII.,"He flutter’d like her fan at Edith’s beck,"
9014,XXXII.,"Her silence fill’d with subtlest flattery,"
9015,XXXII.,Her vacant hours invaded with himself;
9016,XXXII.,"Till all my life, at last, appear’d a plot"
9017,XXXII.,"To steal upon his absence, and then pluck"
9018,XXXII.,Love’s fruit which once his presence only brought.
9019,XXXII.,
9020,XXXII.,
9021,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
9022,XXXIII.,
9023,XXXIII.,"And so, henceforth, I less could welcome him."
9024,XXXIII.,"How could I do it,—with his views of her,"
9025,XXXIII.,Yet wooing her?—He wellnigh made me doubt
9026,XXXIII.,"If I might not mistake her,—doubt I check’d,"
9027,XXXIII.,Flush’d fiercely soon that Elbert’s deeds could hint
9028,XXXIII.,"Thought so unworthy. When I spoke to him,"
9029,XXXIII.,He laugh’d me off.
9030,XXXIII.,"“Why, man, I like your friend,"
9031,XXXIII.,And she likes me; and with the other sex
9032,XXXIII.,"The more we like, sometimes, the less we love—"
9033,XXXIII.,"Or think we love. Do I deceive her, then,"
9034,XXXIII.,In showing friendliness?—Why think you so?—
9035,XXXIII.,"Forsooth, if beauty pleases me, I smile;"
9036,XXXIII.,"If gracefulness beguile me, gaze at it;"
9037,XXXIII.,"If wisdom awe me, offer my respect."
9038,XXXIII.,"Good art I laud; with fancy, am a poet;"
9039,XXXIII.,"And with emotion, an enthusiast."
9040,XXXIII.,What then?—Am I a hypocrite?—How so?—
9041,XXXIII.,Must all our sympathy be personal?
9042,XXXIII.,Must one appropriate all that he would praise?
9043,XXXIII.,"Is beauty such a flower, or is a man"
9044,XXXIII.,"So much a beast, that, having taste for it,"
9045,XXXIII.,He needs must go and gorge it down?—Go to!—
9046,XXXIII.,I watch the fair thing; of its fragrance quaff;
9047,XXXIII.,Then leave for others. Edith knows this well;
9048,XXXIII.,"For that, trust her.”"
9049,XXXIII.,
9050,XXXIII.,
9051,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
9052,XXXIV.,
9053,XXXIV.,"But was it, as he claim’d?"
9054,XXXIV.,Were both of them so wise?—Or would he now
9055,XXXIV.,By sheer sharp practice cut us two apart?
9056,XXXIV.,"This more seem’d like him, and more anger’d me."
9057,XXXIV.,Was I a boy that he should foil me thus?
9058,XXXIV.,
9059,XXXIV.,"Yet what to do?—The more I question’d this,"
9060,XXXIV.,The more I saw but only one true course.
9061,XXXIV.,Our aims—my own and Edith’s—differ’d much.
9062,XXXIV.,Yet knew I more than this. Our hearts were one
9063,XXXIV.,In all desires that had inspired these aims.
9064,XXXIV.,"And if our lives and hearts could be but join’d,"
9065,XXXIV.,"Could not my love and hers, together put,"
9066,XXXIV.,Outweigh such aims as would be hers alone?
9067,XXXIV.,"Why not have faith in love, mine join’d with hers?"
9068,XXXIV.,What power was mightier in the universe?
9069,XXXIV.,Why not have faith to trust this only soul
9070,XXXIV.,"That ever I had met, to whom my moods"
9071,XXXIV.,"Could be unroll’d, assured of insight there"
9072,XXXIV.,"To read them rightly? Why, ’twas all decreed:"
9073,XXXIV.,Her power to read my soul gave her the right
9074,XXXIV.,"To know its love, whatever might be hers."
9075,XXXIV.,"And were I but to speak the truth to her,"
9076,XXXIV.,"So tell her all, why fear the simple truth?"
9077,XXXIV.,"For I would say I loved her, not her aims."
9078,XXXIV.,"If then she should prefer her aims to me,"
9079,XXXIV.,It would be proof that she could love me not.
9080,XXXIV.,"But if she should prefer me to her aims,"
9081,XXXIV.,Then surely she could yield her wish to mine.
9082,XXXIV.,
9083,XXXIV.,
9084,XXXV.,XXXV.
9085,XXXV.,
9086,XXXV.,"So, near the sunset of a summer’s day,"
9087,XXXV.,"While walking by the lake within the park,"
9088,XXXV.,"“I mean,” I breathed out cautiously, “to write"
9089,XXXV.,A tale of love; and I have plann’d the tale
9090,XXXV.,"To open here. In after time, perchance,"
9091,XXXV.,Those minds to whom it proves of interest
9092,XXXV.,"May love to linger here, recalling it."
9093,XXXV.,Look now—this lake. To gain the full effect
9094,XXXV.,"Of palace, park, and yonder heaven unveil’d,"
9095,XXXV.,"One, gazing downward in the water’s depth"
9096,XXXV.,"Should note them wash’d of gross reality,"
9097,XXXV.,And—as in art—reflected. With this view
9098,XXXV.,"This tale of mine shall open. First of all,"
9099,XXXV.,"Here, in the sunshine near us—at our feet—"
9100,XXXV.,"Ay, in the water; ay, friend, here I mean—"
9101,XXXV.,"Just underneath us,—mark you, mark you, there,"
9102,XXXV.,"The hero, and, beside him, his ideal!”"
9103,XXXV.,
9104,XXXV.,
9105,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
9106,XXXVI.,
9107,XXXVI.,"And when she saw us two there, “What?” she cried;"
9108,XXXVI.,"And then stood speechless; whereat I sped on,"
9109,XXXVI.,Detailing all my plans and all my hopes:
9110,XXXVI.,"How she, with soul so true and aim so high,"
9111,XXXVI.,"Might meet in them the mission meant for her,—"
9112,XXXVI.,How all the wrongs of earth might be redeem’d
9113,XXXVI.,Through sacrificial deeds of such as we.
9114,XXXVI.,
9115,XXXVI.,Still stood she silent. Then I spoke again:
9116,XXXVI.,"“But think not, Edith, for my plans alone"
9117,XXXVI.,"I plead with you. I plead, too, for myself;"
9118,XXXVI.,And tell my plans that you may know myself;
9119,XXXVI.,"Not holding that I stand above you, friend."
9120,XXXVI.,"Nay, nay; I oft feel worthy scarce to touch"
9121,XXXVI.,"Your fingers’ tips, or stand erect and taint"
9122,XXXVI.,"The level of the air you breathe in; nay,"
9123,XXXVI.,"I would not judge your life; would only crave,"
9124,XXXVI.,"When we have so much else in sympathy,"
9125,XXXVI.,"That holy state where two souls, else at one,"
9126,XXXVI.,"Would both be God’s.—Ah, could you thus be mine?”"
9127,XXXVI.,
9128,XXXVI.,
9129,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
9130,XXXVII.,
9131,XXXVII.,Her silence then was broken. “Well might I
9132,XXXVII.,Be proud to be thus yours. Who could not find
9133,XXXVII.,"All meet for manhood, in your manliness?"
9134,XXXVII.,"But no, for you forget our different aims."
9135,XXXVII.,You never told me of these plans before.
9136,XXXVII.,"And, Norman, now—no, no; for, through your church,"
9137,XXXVII.,"That fann’d some whim of his, left smouldering,"
9138,XXXVII.,"Some spark of doubt to ardent heresy,"
9139,XXXVII.,"My father suffer’d, lost his honor’d name,"
9140,XXXVII.,"His living, all; nor struggled, scrimpt, and starved"
9141,XXXVII.,To leave his daughter ignorant of the cause.
9142,XXXVII.,"And I?—no, no; it courses through my blood;"
9143,XXXVII.,"And you would hate my tastes, which cannot be"
9144,XXXVII.,"Like yours religious; no, for I was made"
9145,XXXVII.,To be the minister of only art.”
9146,XXXVII.,
9147,XXXVII.,"“But, Edith,” urged I, “truth far more includes"
9148,XXXVII.,Than most men deem who would deem all things theirs.—
9149,XXXVII.,"Your tastes are not religious?—Mine are not,"
9150,XXXVII.,"If by religion you mean piety,—"
9151,XXXVII.,"Religion’s brew, froth’d bubbling to be seen."
9152,XXXVII.,"But how is it beneath the surface, friend?"
9153,XXXVII.,Down deep within?—is not the substance there?
9154,XXXVII.,I never seem’d religious half so much
9155,XXXVII.,As when at one with you.”
9156,XXXVII.,She but replied
9157,XXXVII.,To tell me how “her father’s legacy
9158,XXXVII.,"Had been her sister, whom she must not leave."
9159,XXXVII.,"For her sake, seeking means of livelihood,"
9160,XXXVII.,"She first rejected, then accepted what"
9161,XXXVII.,"Her spirit, spurning once, had learn’d to love;"
9162,XXXVII.,As had her sister; and for both of them
9163,XXXVII.,"Each hope, and joy, and all they thought of now,"
9164,XXXVII.,Was bounded by the music of the stage.
9165,XXXVII.,"Nor could my logic change this; nay,” she said,"
9166,XXXVII.,"“Not logic leads the artist on, but light.”"
9167,XXXVII.,
9168,XXXVII.,
9169,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
9170,XXXVIII.,
9171,XXXVIII.,I heard in vain—I could not give her up.
9172,XXXVIII.,"I urged her still, still hoping her to swerve."
9173,XXXVIII.,"My slight of music, rousing her defence,"
9174,XXXVIII.,But proved my love too weak to rival it.
9175,XXXVIII.,
9176,XXXVIII.,"“My father oft,” she said, “would quote your Book;"
9177,XXXVIII.,Say ‘music marshall’d all the better life.
9178,XXXVIII.,"What else could sway the soul, yet leave love free"
9179,XXXVIII.,"To think and choose and do?’—What different moods,”"
9180,XXXVIII.,"She added, while before us play’d the band,"
9181,XXXVIII.,"“These chords, we hear, arouse in different minds!"
9182,XXXVIII.,That maid may smile amid sweet dreams of love;
9183,XXXVIII.,Her dark attendant dream of but her wealth;
9184,XXXVIII.,That matron plan some fresh self-sacrifice;
9185,XXXVIII.,"And that spare fellow, twirling near her side"
9186,XXXVIII.,"The soft mustache that downs his pursing lips,"
9187,XXXVIII.,Plan only how to hide their stingy look.
9188,XXXVIII.,"And thus all listen, musing different things;"
9189,XXXVIII.,"And all, with conscious freedom, muse of them;"
9190,XXXVIII.,"And yet one harmony controls them all,"
9191,XXXVIII.,Aroused or calm to match its changing flow.
9192,XXXVIII.,What else but music frees the mind it rules?
9193,XXXVIII.,"‘Good-will to man,’ was first proclaim’d in song.”"
9194,XXXVIII.,
9195,XXXVIII.,"“Good-will,” I said, “but follows will for good.”"
9196,XXXVIII.,
9197,XXXVIII.,"“And will for good will come,” she answer’d back."
9198,XXXVIII.,"“As in the older advent, so to-day,"
9199,XXXVIII.,Would I believe in power behind sweet song
9200,XXXVIII.,"To hold the universe in harmony,"
9201,XXXVIII.,Expelling evil and impelling good
9202,XXXVIII.,"Through all the limits of created life,—"
9203,XXXVIII.,A spirit’s power!—What though we mortals here
9204,XXXVIII.,With eyes material cannot see the hosts
9205,XXXVIII.,That issue forth in forms that while they move
9206,XXXVIII.,Awake around us echoes everywhere!
9207,XXXVIII.,"We spring to spy them, but we only hear"
9208,XXXVIII.,Their rustle in the trees by which they pass;
9209,XXXVIII.,"Or where, with dash of water o’er the rocks,"
9210,XXXVIII.,They leave the sea or linger in the rill.
9211,XXXVIII.,"At times they rest a moment on the earth,"
9212,XXXVIII.,"When twilight hides them, sighing gently then,"
9213,XXXVIII.,"And lull to dreams, with tones in sympathy,"
9214,XXXVIII.,The lowly insect and the lowing herd.
9215,XXXVIII.,"At times, amid the winds that rise at morn,"
9216,XXXVIII.,They sweep across the land and startle sleep
9217,XXXVIII.,From nervous birds that twitter in their track;
9218,XXXVIII.,"And, now and then, in clouds that close the sky,"
9219,XXXVIII.,They bound adown the rift the lightning cleaves
9220,XXXVIII.,Till sunlight overhead pours through again.
9221,XXXVIII.,A spirit’s power has music; and must rule
9222,XXXVIII.,"Unrivall’d still as far as ear can heed,"
9223,XXXVIII.,Or reason hark behind it. All the chords
9224,XXXVIII.,"Of all things true are tuned by hands divine,"
9225,XXXVIII.,And thrill to feel the touch!—
9226,XXXVIII.,But sounds may rise
9227,XXXVIII.,"In souls untuned, like harp-strings when they snap,"
9228,XXXVIII.,"Or, though more soft than dreamland breezes are,"
9229,XXXVIII.,May fright like forests when the dark leaves blow
9230,XXXVIII.,About the solitary murderer—
9231,XXXVIII.,And sweetest airs to sweetest moods may bring
9232,XXXVIII.,But foretastes vague of harmonies on high.
9233,XXXVIII.,"The school-girl hears her comrade’s ringing laugh,—"
9234,XXXVIII.,’Tis but the key-note trill’d before the tune.
9235,XXXVIII.,"The maiden heeds her lover’s mellow plea,—"
9236,XXXVIII.,’Tis but the gamut rill’d ere surge the chords.
9237,XXXVIII.,"The dame is moved by tones that cheer her home,—"
9238,XXXVIII.,And they perchance prelude the theme of heaven.
9239,XXXVIII.,For even blows of toil and battle-guns
9240,XXXVIII.,May be the drum-rolls of the martial strains
9241,XXXVIII.,That rise to greet the glory yet to come.
9242,XXXVIII.,"Ay, wait we long enough, we all may hear"
9243,XXXVIII.,"In all things music; far above, at last,"
9244,XXXVIII.,"May hear the treble thrilling down from heaven,"
9245,XXXVIII.,And e’en from hell no discord in the jar
9246,XXXVIII.,That only thunders back a trembling bass.”
9247,XXXVIII.,
9248,XXXVIII.,"Thus Edith spake; while I, left lonely all,"
9249,XXXVIII.,"Beheld her, ardent for her art, a cloud,"
9250,XXXVIII.,"Aglow by dawn, then drawn away, away."
9251,XXXVIII.,
9252,XXXVIII.,
9253,XXXIX.,XXXIX.
9254,XXXIX.,
9255,XXXIX.,"I said, I know not what; but far too proud,"
9256,XXXIX.,"Intoxicated though I was by love,"
9257,XXXIX.,"To let her view the folly of my fall,"
9258,XXXIX.,"I said not all I felt; but what I felt,"
9259,XXXIX.,"Beneath the first fierce humbling of the storm,"
9260,XXXIX.,Floods o’er my memory yet with half the woe
9261,XXXIX.,"That overwhelm’d me then. Am I, I thought,"
9262,XXXIX.,"So strong in love, and waiting long for it,"
9263,XXXIX.,"And always true to it, to be outweigh’d"
9264,XXXIX.,"By mere brute chaff of manhood, on the stage"
9265,XXXIX.,Or in the pit? I swore ’twas ever so
9266,XXXIX.,With all her sex. Worth never weigh’d a straw.
9267,XXXIX.,A very satyr could outwoo a sage.—
9268,XXXIX.,Weak woman!—yet she must be weak—in brain
9269,XXXIX.,Or body. Better to be weak in brain!
9270,XXXIX.,"She then, perchance, might serve a husband’s thought,"
9271,XXXIX.,And wisdom’s voice might rule the family!
9272,XXXIX.,"But were her moods too strong to serve his thought,"
9273,XXXIX.,She might serve that in him which could not think.—
9274,XXXIX.,"To wed she-brains, a man should seek to be"
9275,XXXIX.,Commended as a fool!
9276,XXXIX.,
9277,XXXIX.,
9278,XL.,XL.
9279,XL.,
9280,XL.,And then I stopp’d:—
9281,XL.,"Here raved I, jealous of this fool alone,"
9282,XL.,This coming clown.—To think of him I blush’d—
9283,XL.,"But what of her?—of Edith?—She would live,"
9284,XL.,"With faintest smile, to fascinate—ah—crowds!"
9285,XL.,"The rabble would be ravish’d but, forsooth,"
9286,XL.,To clap with crazy hands the rarer air
9287,XL.,"Wherein she moved. For them, her voice would sound,"
9288,XL.,With every trill so swaying all who heard
9289,XL.,That thronging cheers would thunder in response!—
9290,XL.,"Her form, so sweet, would plead till foulest lives"
9291,XL.,"Would feel how pure were joys beyond their reach,"
9292,XL.,And long for things their touch could never taint!
9293,XL.,"My sweet, sweet love!—"
9294,XL.,"But, moving at her side,"
9295,XL.,"Should I be aught?—Alas, I could but seem—"
9296,XL.,"Beside the gilded glory of the stage,"
9297,XL.,"Beside the loud-mouthed suitors of the show,"
9298,XL.,"An unwhipt cur, to wait at some backdoor,"
9299,XL.,And jar with signalling bark the echo sweet
9300,XL.,Of all-the-town’s applause. She mine would be
9301,XL.,"But as the sun, whose flaming brow has touch’d"
9302,XL.,"The morning sea that flushes far and near,"
9303,XL.,"Is thine, O trembling globulet of spray,"
9304,XL.,"Because, forsooth, his image, glass’d in all"
9305,XL.,"The sea and world, is glass’d, as well, in thee!—"
9306,XL.,"Fool, fool! yet dear, dear folly!"
9307,XL.,These my thoughts;
9308,XL.,My words—all I recall now—came at last
9309,XL.,When slowly sauntering back we reach’d her home.
9310,XL.,"“Would God,” I sigh’d, “the time might come for us,"
9311,XL.,"When, looking toward the future now so lone,"
9312,XL.,We two should need no more to say good-night.”
9313,XL.,
9314,XL.,"“Good-bye,” she said, and left me in the gloom."
9315,XL.,
9316,XL.,
9317,XLI.,XLI.
9318,XLI.,
9319,XLI.,"Then was it, as I turn’d about, by chance,"
9320,XLI.,I came on Elbert; and my whole soul rose
9321,XLI.,To dash at him its briny bitterness.
9322,XLI.,"Is he here, thought I,—he to whom, alas,"
9323,XLI.,"The very potion, poisoning all my hopes,"
9324,XLI.,"Will prove the sparkling nectar of success,"
9325,XLI.,"And bring good cheer, though bringing death to me?—"
9326,XLI.,"Then let him share it!—Still, my wiser pride"
9327,XLI.,"The purpose check’d, and balancing rash hate"
9328,XLI.,"With hateful prudence, closed his opening smile"
9329,XLI.,But with a frown that would not welcome him.
9330,XLI.,
9331,XLI.,"With any truth to self, so argued I,"
9332,XLI.,I could do nothing else; nor could abide
9333,XLI.,A town that held him. So I left the town;
9334,XLI.,"And so these friends of mine, so prized of old,"
9335,XLI.,"And I had parted,—not as friends would part,"
9336,XLI.,With love’s high zenith fever’d like the skies
9337,XLI.,"Where eve has rent from them a fervid sun,"
9338,XLI.,Then cool’d and calm’d in starlight sprinkled thick
9339,XLI.,"Until the sun come back. We crack’d apart,"
9340,XLI.,"Like icebergs drifting southward, join’d no more,"
9341,XLI.,And sunn’d alone the while they melt away.
9342,XLI.,
9343,XLI.,
9344,XLII.,XLII.
9345,XLII.,
9346,XLII.,No need is there that here I should recall—
9347,XLII.,I would not if I could—my suffering.
9348,XLII.,"From Elbert, best of friends, my nobler self,"
9349,XLII.,"My soul of virtue and my heart of love,"
9350,XLII.,"What cause could rightly tear me?—Asking this,"
9351,XLII.,My heart rose up from reason to rebel;
9352,XLII.,Indignant to have found a theory
9353,XLII.,That dared to hold an innate impulse down;
9354,XLII.,"While will, caught there, betwixt the heart and head,"
9355,XLII.,"Each charge would bear, and yet forbear to act."
9356,XLII.,"And Edith, peerless Edith! how my soul"
9357,XLII.,"Would struggle to forget her! Struggling thus,"
9358,XLII.,"How fair her form, conjured by raving thought,"
9359,XLII.,"Would rise, a Venus o’er my sea of sighs,"
9360,XLII.,"Till I would bend, and seem to plead anon"
9361,XLII.,To be forgiven for forgetting her!
9362,XLII.,"And then, how would I tear her traits apart;"
9363,XLII.,And pluck the petals from each budding grace
9364,XLII.,"And hope its naked stem some trace would show,"
9365,XLII.,"Too void of beauty, to suggest again"
9366,XLII.,The bloom and sweetness of the life I loved.
9367,XLII.,"Alas, but while I wrought for this alone,"
9368,XLII.,How would her virtues but the more unfold!—
9369,XLII.,"Like God’s own glory flowering in the skies,"
9370,XLII.,"That those detect who would not find it there,"
9371,XLII.,"But, when they test the stars, have dealt with light."
9372,XLII.,
9373,XLII.,
9374,XLIII.,XLIII.
9375,XLIII.,
9376,XLIII.,I wrought and rested; it was all in vain.
9377,XLIII.,My highest consolation was the hope
9378,XLIII.,That hard-earn’d sleep might hold me long in dreams
9379,XLIII.,"Where evermore my soul might with her dwell,"
9380,XLIII.,Though every morn I seem’d yet more alone.
9381,XLIII.,"Awake, asleep, throned constant o’er my heart,"
9382,XLIII.,"I served this image all intangible,"
9383,XLIII.,"This photographic fantasy of truth,"
9384,XLIII.,"This fairy nothingness of vanish’d fact,"
9385,XLIII.,"A shape to love, minute yet mighty still,"
9386,XLIII.,"To senses nothing, but to spirit all."
9387,XLIII.,
9388,XLIII.,
9389,XLIV.,XLIV.
9390,XLIV.,
9391,XLIV.,"Thus lived I, triumph’d over; as are clouds"
9392,XLIV.,"Whereon the sun sits throned; all bright are they,"
9393,XLIV.,And bright beneath them is the sunset sea.
9394,XLIV.,"In splendid serfdom to its love, my soul,"
9395,XLIV.,"That shone with kindling glory, thence beheld"
9396,XLIV.,A kindling glory shine from all about.
9397,XLIV.,
9398,XLIV.,No whim of mine was this; it fills my creed;
9399,XLIV.,The graft of all true love regenerates.
9400,XLIV.,"Those in whom love is born are born anew,"
9401,XLIV.,And all their family of fancies then
9402,XLIV.,"Bear family traits; those loving, and those not,"
9403,XLIV.,Being wide apart as rainbows and the rain.
9404,XLIV.,"I might be superstitious, but to me"
9405,XLIV.,The temple of my life’s experience
9406,XLIV.,"Had been less sacred, had it held no shrine"
9407,XLIV.,Whereon to heap sweet tokens of my love.
9408,XLIV.,"And all that loom’d around seem’d holier now,"
9409,XLIV.,Illumed by holy lights of memory.
9410,XLIV.,
9411,XLIV.,Nor long was it ere I had grown to share
9412,XLIV.,In all the love of all with whom I met;
9413,XLIV.,"And oft, too, thus invoking sympathy,"
9414,XLIV.,"My wishes wrought like witches, and conjured"
9415,XLIV.,The thing they wish’d for: sympathy would come.
9416,XLIV.,
9417,XLIV.,
9418,XLV.,XLV.
9419,XLV.,
9420,XLV.,"And so my moods, thus moving on, at last"
9421,XLV.,Found special pleasure in a friendship form’d
9422,XLV.,Upon a day of tramping through the Alps.
9423,XLV.,"Her name was Grace, and gracious was her mien;"
9424,XLV.,And graces everywhere attended her
9425,XLV.,Through jars and joys of journeys afterward.
9426,XLV.,So splendid never as my Edith; never
9427,XLV.,"So striking, so alluring, or so shunn’d;"
9428,XLV.,"Her brilliance would not dim a rival’s eyes,"
9429,XLV.,Nor beauty shade another’s face with frowns.
9430,XLV.,"One saw in her a modest, model maid,"
9431,XLV.,A woman loved by women; and with men
9432,XLV.,"A presence, mellow-lighting like the moon;"
9433,XLV.,"Yet could she shed no light when came my storms,"
9434,XLV.,As now they came full often. Then it seem’d
9435,XLV.,Her very mildness made her moods too dull
9436,XLV.,To penetrate the clouds that cover’d mine.
9437,XLV.,
9438,XLV.,
9439,XLVI.,XLVI.
9440,XLVI.,
9441,XLVI.,"“It must be lonesome here for one like you,"
9442,XLVI.,"A stranger-land, indeed, here,” would she sigh."
9443,XLVI.,"“Why could we not, church people, day by day,"
9444,XLVI.,"Have converse here, and thus live more at one?”"
9445,XLVI.,
9446,XLVI.,"When hearts hold secrets, even love that comes,"
9447,XLVI.,"And comes in crowds, will bring the prying soul"
9448,XLVI.,Full drive to spring them open. How I shrank
9449,XLVI.,To meet with those with whom my soul could find
9450,XLVI.,No source of sympathy beneath the sound
9451,XLVI.,Produced when tongue and teeth and lips combine
9452,XLVI.,To mouth one shibboleth! A fate like this
9453,XLVI.,"Foretoken’d only, made me well nigh faint"
9454,XLVI.,"As feels a soldier, falling at his post,"
9455,XLVI.,With heart shell’d out and emptied of the soul.
9456,XLVI.,"I could but find excuses, partly real"
9457,XLVI.,"And partly feign’d, the fringe of ready whims."
9458,XLVI.,
9459,XLVI.,
9460,XLVII.,XLVII.
9461,XLVII.,
9462,XLVII.,She startled echoes from my inmost soul
9463,XLVII.,By words that named my “life-work.”
9464,XLVII.,"“Yes,” I said;"
9465,XLVII.,“We all should sympathize. All own one lord;
9466,XLVII.,All wait beside one shore; all watch one tide.—
9467,XLVII.,So too do snipes and snails! and so do souls
9468,XLVII.,That yet shall rule in heaven ten towns and one.
9469,XLVII.,"Souls differ, Grace; and John from James, as well"
9470,XLVII.,As both from Judas.—Judas lingers too.”
9471,XLVII.,
9472,XLVII.,"“So many,” sigh’d she, “sell their Christ, and think"
9473,XLVII.,"Souls rich, that but receive suggestions rich"
9474,XLVII.,From art or——”
9475,XLVII.,"Had regard for Edith, now,"
9476,XLVII.,"Made me, at last, a champion of art?—"
9477,XLVII.,"“However or wherever plied,” I said,"
9478,XLVII.,“Real power for good owns good enough to claim
9479,XLVII.,Some courtesy from Christian charity.
9480,XLVII.,"If I but fling a stone in yonder pond,"
9481,XLVII.,"Wherever it may fall, it stirs the whole."
9482,XLVII.,"So if I throw out thought for mind or heart,"
9483,XLVII.,"Through art or through religion, each may move"
9484,XLVII.,"The whole man thus, and move him for his good.”"
9485,XLVII.,
9486,XLVII.,"“Ah, but,” she breathed, with slight dogmatic stress,"
9487,XLVII.,"“A simple woman, I would move his heart,"
9488,XLVII.,"Through love, as Christ too did; not so?”"
9489,XLVII.,"“Do this,”"
9490,XLVII.,"I said, “you do but what is woman’s right;"
9491,XLVII.,And none about you will dispute the right.
9492,XLVII.,But ask me not to limit thus the Christ.
9493,XLVII.,"How dare I?—if our churches teach the truth,"
9494,XLVII.,If He incarnated the sum of life
9495,XLVII.,"And spirit of all good,—his holiness"
9496,XLVII.,"His wholeness, and His perfectness, the proof"
9497,XLVII.,Of what He was? Nor dare I limit those
9498,XLVII.,"Who follow Him.—Why may they not live His,"
9499,XLVII.,"Not aiming here nor there, but everywhere"
9500,XLVII.,To make the most of all God meant them for.
9501,XLVII.,And things there are that art can do for man
9502,XLVII.,To make him manlier. Not the senseless rock
9503,XLVII.,Is all it fashions into forms of sense;
9504,XLVII.,"But senseless manhood, natures hard and harsh,"
9505,XLVII.,"Great classes crush’d, and races driven to crawl"
9506,XLVII.,"Till all their souls are stain’d with smut and soil,—"
9507,XLVII.,More human seem these when the hands of art
9508,XLVII.,Have grasp’d their better traits and hold them forth.
9509,XLVII.,"And men who see these better traits, and see"
9510,XLVII.,"The tender touch of art that holds them forth,"
9511,XLVII.,Behold a beauty never else beheld;
9512,XLVII.,And all their hearts beat more humanely while
9513,XLVII.,They heed the plea of these humanities.
9514,XLVII.,"And so, I think, although the wilderness,"
9515,XLVII.,"At times, a John in camel’s hair may need,"
9516,XLVII.,"There open too, in ways of life less wild,"
9517,XLVII.,"More ways, where love may plead in guise more soft."
9518,XLVII.,"In short, as long as one may choose his course,"
9519,XLVII.,’Tis best we do what each can do the best.”
9520,XLVII.,
9521,XLVII.,
9522,XLVIII.,XLVIII.
9523,XLVIII.,
9524,XLVIII.,"“Oh, you perplexing!” cried she; “not for me,"
9525,XLVIII.,"For _your_ brain! Tell, pray, where it rummaged last,"
9526,XLVIII.,"To catch these cobwebs?—I have seen them, yes;"
9527,XLVIII.,"These halls are full of them, and libraries,"
9528,XLVIII.,"Old musty things!—But, Norman, soberly,"
9529,XLVIII.,"This German text is bad for eyesight, yes;"
9530,XLVIII.,"And half I doubt—Come, tell me, tell the truth,"
9531,XLVIII.,Do _you_ see clearly aught that you can do?”
9532,XLVIII.,“Why so?” I ask’d; “do you?”
9533,XLVIII.,"“Why not,” she said,"
9534,XLVIII.,"All serious now, “do what shall yield life’s day"
9535,XLVIII.,The most of glory at its evening hour?—
9536,XLVIII.,The sun sets brightest after days of storm.”
9537,XLVIII.,
9538,XLVIII.,"“What, always?” ask’d I; “are you sure of this?"
9539,XLVIII.,I know true faith that mainly aims to rid
9540,XLVIII.,Our present life from fears of future ill.
9541,XLVIII.,"To it what need of storms, if sunshine here"
9542,XLVIII.,May best prepare one for the future calm?
9543,XLVIII.,That future is eternal; even so
9544,XLVIII.,How can we gauge th’ eternal save by time?
9545,XLVIII.,"How can we judge of joy that will not end,"
9546,XLVIII.,"Save by our own, if ours would only last?"
9547,XLVIII.,"What is it to be blessèd, if not this,—"
9548,XLVIII.,To find our process of becoming blest
9549,XLVIII.,"Made permanent, our young weak wings of faith"
9550,XLVIII.,"Full fledged and flying by habit?—and if so,"
9551,XLVIII.,"Heaven’s habits are form’d here. Suppose a youth,"
9552,XLVIII.,"That, by and by, he may enjoy much wealth,"
9553,XLVIII.,"Act miserly,—what gains he by and by?—"
9554,XLVIII.,"Much wealth, perhaps; but, holding with it, too,"
9555,XLVIII.,"The miser’s moods, establish’d now as traits,"
9556,XLVIII.,"Incorporated modes of all his life,"
9557,XLVIII.,He with them holds what most unfits the soul
9558,XLVIII.,"To use wealth, or enjoy it. So on earth"
9559,XLVIII.,"When avarice, aim’d for heaven, makes man a monk,"
9560,XLVIII.,"What can he gain thereby, save monkish moods,"
9561,XLVIII.,Become establish’d in him now as traits.
9562,XLVIII.,Incorporated modes of all his life?
9563,XLVIII.,"But, holding these, the soul must with them hold"
9564,XLVIII.,"What most unfits it to enjoy—not here,"
9565,XLVIII.,"In any sphere at all,—a life of love.”"
9566,XLVIII.,
9567,XLVIII.,
9568,XLIX.,XLIX.
9569,XLIX.,
9570,XLIX.,"“You surely would not mean,” she ask’d and paused,"
9571,XLIX.,“That you could throw aside your hopes? your vows?
9572,XLIX.,Your life-work?—seek enjoyment?”
9573,XLIX.,"“Ah,” said I,"
9574,XLIX.,“Enjoyment is the man’s most heartfelt praise
9575,XLIX.,"To Him that fram’d his being. What should I,"
9576,XLIX.,"A child of God, do here but live God’s life?—"
9577,XLIX.,"Which is not now, nor then, but evermore."
9578,XLIX.,"My soul must thrive the best, as best I make"
9579,XLIX.,"My now, eternal; my eternal, now."
9580,XLIX.,"So when a storm comes, let me bar it out;"
9581,XLIX.,"And, braced against the present ill, grow strong;"
9582,XLIX.,"And when the sunshine, let me open wide"
9583,XLIX.,To that which makes all nature grow more sweet.
9584,XLIX.,"Thus, realizing in my earthly state"
9585,XLIX.,"The aim of heaven, why do I praise Him less"
9586,XLIX.,"Whose life is that of heaven, than those who wear"
9587,XLIX.,"The guises of that slattern of the soul,"
9588,XLIX.,"Asceticism, shuffling toward far good,"
9589,XLIX.,Slipshod and snivelling?”—
9590,XLIX.,"“Now, that goes too far!”"
9591,XLIX.,"Cried Grace. “Do I do this?—Ah, but I know"
9592,XLIX.,"A man so moody!—Own it. Were I you,"
9593,XLIX.,"I just would set to work. To work off whims,"
9594,XLIX.,"The best way, say they, is to work them out;"
9595,XLIX.,One hand at work is worth ten heads that shirk.”
9596,XLIX.,
9597,XLIX.,“You find me moody!” sigh’d I; “and complain;
9598,XLIX.,"Deem moods not meet. Oh, no they prove we feel!—"
9599,XLIX.,Nor pious they: they prove we think!”
9600,XLIX.,
9601,XLIX.,
9602,L.,L.
9603,L.,
9604,L.,"And yet,"
9605,L.,I could but blame myself; so fain to draw
9606,L.,This gentler soul from her still streams of life
9607,L.,Toward waves thus fiercely dash’d about my own!
9608,L.,"You know, though, how it is: our thought, like light,"
9609,L.,"Opposed, will vaunt itself; and brightest play,"
9610,L.,Glanced off from things it does not penetrate.
9611,L.,"So, more to shock her than for sympathy,"
9612,L.,My thought play’d round the surface of her life:
9613,L.,It had been shaped so—to so smooth a thing—
9614,L.,I burn’d to warp it of complacency.
9615,L.,"Oft, though unconscious of the least mistruth,"
9616,L.,"I feign’d a fall in fancied depths of ill,"
9617,L.,And mock’d that I might hear her call me thence;
9618,L.,And learn’d therein to envy some the rake.
9619,L.,For what a charm it were to hear—not so?
9620,L.,"That is, if one were vicious, through and through—"
9621,L.,Such pleas for love from lips that aye were pure?
9622,L.,The very depth of one’s unworthiness
9623,L.,Would whet such relish for a thing so strange!
9624,L.,
9625,L.,
9626,LI.,LI.
9627,LI.,
9628,LI.,"But weeks and months went by, in which she fill’d"
9629,LI.,"A certain void in life; and, every eve,"
9630,LI.,We parted for the night made better friends.
9631,LI.,"Once, ending thus, the pleasures of the day,"
9632,LI.,"We chanced upon a path where, sauntering too,"
9633,LI.,"Lo, Elbert enter’d and encounter’d us."
9634,LI.,
9635,LI.,"At first scarce friendly, after divers tests,"
9636,LI.,"And in the new light of my life with her,"
9637,LI.,His older love return’d with oldest warmth:
9638,LI.,"“To think so thin a fancy,” he exclaim’d,"
9639,LI.,"“As last I found you folded in, should screen"
9640,LI.,"Our genuine hearts, a moment, each from each!”"
9641,LI.,
9642,LI.,
9643,LII.,LII.
9644,LII.,
9645,LII.,The fancy thin!—I let him keep his word;
9646,LII.,"I would not argue.—Still, with care not loath"
9647,LII.,"To guard some credit yet for having sense,"
9648,LII.,"I hinted at the truth,—how I had changed,"
9649,LII.,"And how had changed my thoughts about myself,"
9650,LII.,"About my life-work. “For that fancy, friend,"
9651,LII.,That fancy thin my own true self reveal’d.
9652,LII.,"If spray it were, it left a constant sea"
9653,LII.,"That heaves and heaves. With moods that move like mine,"
9654,LII.,"So madden’d by traditions, calm’d by dreams,"
9655,LII.,"Content scarce ever, till at hazard dash’d"
9656,LII.,"Through ways that lead to sheer uncertainty,"
9657,LII.,Where fancy more may seek than matter shows
9658,LII.,"In things that are but matter,—what am I"
9659,LII.,"For life-work such as priesthood, sure in creeds"
9660,LII.,"And sureties for the soul, whereon may lean"
9661,LII.,"All weaker faith, with warrant not to bend?”"
9662,LII.,
9663,LII.,
9664,LIII.,LIII.
9665,LIII.,
9666,LIII.,"Then Elbert laugh’d. “Ah, were you but a bow,"
9667,LIII.,Your bending most would shoot most.—Not a priest?
9668,LIII.,A man alone?—You yet a brother are
9669,LIII.,"To many a soul that sails the sea of life,"
9670,LIII.,Where oft the horizon trembles with the change
9671,LIII.,"Of wind and wave; and hope, too hale, oft mourns"
9672,LIII.,"Fair promises, like skies that fade in fog."
9673,LIII.,A man alone?—And yet the moods of man
9674,LIII.,"May make men love us for our manliness,"
9675,LIII.,"Who draw them, Christ-like through our sympathy,"
9676,LIII.,"Toward self,—God’s image here, and thus toward Him.”"
9677,LIII.,
9678,LIII.,"“But draw them how?” I cried. “Woe me, I stand,"
9679,LIII.,"A poet born, who deem’d his Muse had fled;"
9680,LIII.,"That time and trouble had a stone roll’d up,"
9681,LIII.,Her sweet form sealing in their sepulchre.
9682,LIII.,And yet one breath of love could rouse the dead.
9683,LIII.,"All day the subtle spirit haunts me now,"
9684,LIII.,Thrill’d through and through to sound her sweetness forth.”
9685,LIII.,
9686,LIII.,"“Then let it sound!” he said. “Rare rest it were,"
9687,LIII.,Were all one’s recreation freshen’d thus;
9688,LIII.,And slumber serenaded by the Muse.”
9689,LIII.,
9690,LIII.,“One’s recreation! slumber!” I exclaim’d;
9691,LIII.,“Is mind a deep that wells with most of thought
9692,LIII.,When void the most? I tell you none can draw
9693,LIII.,A truthful inspiration save from truth.
9694,LIII.,"The poet’s ken may people heaven like clouds,"
9695,LIII.,"All phantom shaped, and splendid as their sun;"
9696,LIII.,But all his fairest forms were vapors first
9697,LIII.,"That heaven drew, mist-like, from the earth beneath."
9698,LIII.,"Thought decks itself in holiday attire,—"
9699,LIII.,"Turns fantasy,—to expend the inertia large"
9700,LIII.,"Of large reserves of philosophic force,"
9701,LIII.,"Forced into play, the night’s dream opening where"
9702,LIII.,The day’s work closes.”
9703,LIII.,"“Close work thus,” he said;"
9704,LIII.,“And all the measures of your verse may show
9705,LIII.,How sweet can be the echoes waked anon
9706,LIII.,By labor’s ringing anvil.”
9707,LIII.,"“Nay,” I sigh’d."
9708,LIII.,"“Such work would bring too much of sleep,—no dreams."
9709,LIII.,"When born with souls like harps the Muse would play,"
9710,LIII.,What better can men do than toil to keep
9711,LIII.,Their thoughts and feelings close in tune with truth?
9712,LIII.,"For this will tax them wholly. They, who try,"
9713,LIII.,"With those few strings that fate has given to them,"
9714,LIII.,To play all parts of all the orchestra
9715,LIII.,Will help the play of no part. We are men;
9716,LIII.,And straight and narrow must our pathways be.
9717,LIII.,"If, Adam-like, we would be gods, we fall."
9718,LIII.,"Not given to mortal is the life supreme,"
9719,LIII.,"In naught unbalanced, laden light in naught,"
9720,LIII.,"Existence evermore at equipoise,"
9721,LIII.,Complete with that which on itself depends.
9722,LIII.,"Oft, who his worth would double, nothing does"
9723,LIII.,"Except to break the back of worth that was,"
9724,LIII.,While doubled burdens fall to doubled waste.
9725,LIII.,"We men should humbler be, and pray to heaven"
9726,LIII.,To have horizons hanging nearer us.
9727,LIII.,"Our views too broad unfit us for the earth,"
9728,LIII.,"Yet fit us not for loneliness divine,—"
9729,LIII.,"The wide chill chaos, back behind the stars.”"
9730,LIII.,
9731,LIII.,
9732,LIV.,LIV.
9733,LIV.,
9734,LIV.,"Thus would I talk, and trouble Elbert much,"
9735,LIV.,For he would rouse me in his rattling way:
9736,LIV.,"“Why, Norman, you are hedging all our hopes."
9737,LIV.,Do not you pity moods that dote on you?
9738,LIV.,"If, man, your metaphysics be not yet"
9739,LIV.,"Beyond all physics, pray you, cure yourself;"
9740,LIV.,Be more material; or material powers
9741,LIV.,"Will alienated grow, and so forget"
9742,LIV.,And count you out in all their reckonings;
9743,LIV.,"And you who are of earth, will earth own not;"
9744,LIV.,"And you who would be heaven’s, will heaven own not."
9745,LIV.,"To own yourself and only own yourself,"
9746,LIV.,"Is worse than serfdom that has earn’d a smile,"
9747,LIV.,Though but from wrinkling cheeks of sham good-will.”
9748,LIV.,
9749,LIV.,
9750,LV.,LV.
9751,LV.,
9752,LV.,"Then, through my gloom exploring for its cause,"
9753,LV.,His thought would light on Edith. He was right;
9754,LV.,"Perhaps less right, grew garrulous of Grace."
9755,LV.,"For deeming love’s return my only hope,"
9756,LV.,"And, seeking this, resolved, as well, to find it,"
9757,LV.,My slightest flush could furnish him a glow
9758,LV.,As bright to light his pathway as the day.
9759,LV.,
9760,LV.,Of course I could deny it; say I held
9761,LV.,No key to spring the latch of love like hers.
9762,LV.,"Our lips, but parting e’en to speak of love,"
9763,LV.,"Infringe on Cupid; and, before they shut,"
9764,LV.,Some tingling arrow of that jealous god
9765,LV.,Will make them drop all soberness.
9766,LV.,He laugh’d:
9767,LV.,"“Now say you never saw the sea, for waves;"
9768,LV.,"Or stars, for twinkling; or the trees, for leaves;"
9769,LV.,"But tell me not, you never saw the heart"
9770,LV.,That bosom heaves; nor ever saw the play
9771,LV.,Of faith and freak within that twinkling eye;
9772,LV.,Nor ever saw the spirit when the smile
9773,LV.,That breaks in laughter shakes the form aside.
9774,LV.,"Come, friend, I know you better. Say you err;"
9775,LV.,"Or, by my soul, I never read you yet.”"
9776,LV.,
9777,LV.,"“And more,” said I; “she is not my ideal.”"
9778,LV.,
9779,LV.,He laugh’d again: “Most men who court ideals
9780,LV.,"Have first their idol; and, the false god fell’d,"
9781,LV.,"Hoard then the fringe that dangled on its train,"
9782,LV.,And spend their lives in hunting other trains
9783,LV.,To match but forms and colors of the first.
9784,LV.,"It strikes me, friend, that all things truthful grow."
9785,LV.,E’en love outgrows the fashion of its youth:—
9786,LV.,The world whirls on apace; and different hues
9787,LV.,Turn toward the noonday-sun. No dawn returns.
9788,LV.,What form or color robes the infinite?—
9789,LV.,Yet aught to worship matches that alone.
9790,LV.,"So look you less for worship, than for worth."
9791,LV.,"You need a mate, friend; not a mystery.”"
9792,LV.,
9793,LV.,"“A mate,” I said, “but she for whims could waive"
9794,LV.,The truth whereto was anchor’d all my soul.”
9795,LV.,
9796,LV.,
9797,LVI.,LVI.
9798,LVI.,
9799,LVI.,Still Elbert parried me: “To hear you prate
9800,LVI.,"Of truth—with women!—Why, you tried that once,"
9801,LVI.,"With Edith, not so?—and she liked it, eh?"
9802,LVI.,Herself had love for that same truth?—What then?—
9803,LVI.,"How very strange, when yesterday she pass’d,"
9804,LVI.,She craved no more of it.”
9805,LVI.,“She pass’d?” I cried.
9806,LVI.,
9807,LVI.,"“Ay, ay,” said he; “while you, so wrapp’d in Grace,"
9808,LVI.,"Walk’d near, and noted nothing. How she turn’d!—"
9809,LVI.,"Then spoke of ‘haste, such haste, she could not stay’;"
9810,LVI.,"And bade me ‘not to tell’ you.—Thus, you see,"
9811,LVI.,I keep my word; I promised nothing though.”
9812,LVI.,
9813,LVI.,"At this, I blush’d; it but encouraged him."
9814,LVI.,
9815,LVI.,“This flame of sympathy you deem’d so bright
9816,LVI.,Extinguish’d was—you may have thought by me.
9817,LVI.,"If so, I tell you, friend, ’twas lightly done."
9818,LVI.,I but outblew you; and the moral is:—
9819,LVI.,"True flames, these women flicker with the wind."
9820,LVI.,"But use you breath enough, their natures yield."
9821,LVI.,"Yet blow for their sakes, not for your ideals."
9822,LVI.,One seldom finds a sweetheart sweet enough
9823,LVI.,To love her suitor’s pinings for mere whims.
9824,LVI.,"Nay, they alone our all-in-all would be;"
9825,LVI.,And so are jealous of our male ideals.
9826,LVI.,"Then, too, they are creative less than we,"
9827,LVI.,"And cling more to the creature, love and serve"
9828,LVI.,Embodied life that may be seen and felt.
9829,LVI.,"You doubt me?—Test it.—Read that rhyme you wrote,"
9830,LVI.,Inspired by fancy.—Say so;—still they hint.
9831,LVI.,"‘Ah, this was she, or she, whom once he loved.’"
9832,LVI.,"It may be, Grace does waive your love of truth."
9833,LVI.,"If so, ’tis better; more you seem her own.”"
9834,LVI.,
9835,LVI.,"“More likely,” cried I, “I and all my truth"
9836,LVI.,"Seem like champagne,—a thing that pops and shocks,"
9837,LVI.,But yet enlivens when the hour is dull.”
9838,LVI.,
9839,LVI.,"“She likes the shocking,” said he. “Know you not"
9840,LVI.,Most maids love mastery? and the closest cling
9841,LVI.,To those who show the strength to hold them fast?
9842,LVI.,"Full many a suitor, when he wins his love,"
9843,LVI.,"Will treat her merely like some petted puss,"
9844,LVI.,"Caress, then cuff her, till she yield at last,"
9845,LVI.,Won solely through his wondrous wilfulness.
9846,LVI.,"If one defer to her, she pities him;"
9847,LVI.,"And names him friend, because she feels him frail."
9848,LVI.,"Her favorite cavalier seems less a friend,"
9849,LVI.,"At first, than foe who stays the brunt in time"
9850,LVI.,To seem to save her when she seems to fall.”
9851,LVI.,
9852,LVI.,"“And should make him fall,” cried I. “’Tis not strange"
9853,LVI.,Such onsets numb her senses! Heaven preserve
9854,LVI.,"The world from women rear’d to feel but weak,"
9855,LVI.,"Whose whole experience, nurtur’d not to think,"
9856,LVI.,"Unfolds in passions pert of wishes dwarf’d,"
9857,LVI.,Afraid of truth and dodging to deceit!
9858,LVI.,"Let loose from home, their thing that ought to think"
9859,LVI.,Is dry and hollow as a sounding-board
9860,LVI.,"Behind a tongue that, like a weather vane,"
9861,LVI.,Creaks with the windy scandal of the town
9862,LVI.,"Till endless malice make one’s ear-drum ache,"
9863,LVI.,"At one spot hammer’d sore, and o’er and o’er,"
9864,LVI.,With humdrum gossip of surrounding naught.
9865,LVI.,"Small gain are they, to crown our courtships grand,"
9866,LVI.,Prinked out with flowers and flattery! Wise man;
9867,LVI.,"Flowers draw the bee, and flattery the fool."
9868,LVI.,"One stings; the other—Laugh not, Elbert, nay,"
9869,LVI.,"You know it well, what friendship craves; and these"
9870,LVI.,"Light, simpering women, testing manhood’s woof"
9871,LVI.,"By worthless nap that tickles their vanity,—"
9872,LVI.,"O I shall wait some coming woman, I,"
9873,LVI.,Who needs no suing since in soul we suit;
9874,LVI.,Nor ruling either.—Love shall rule us both.”
9875,LVI.,
9876,LVI.,"“You true Pygmalion,” cried he, “make a maid!—"
9877,LVI.,"But all maids grow to us, when wedded once;"
9878,LVI.,"For practical, they are, far more than men,"
9879,LVI.,"And bow to powers that be. Though caught, like fish,"
9880,LVI.,"Through bait they crave not ere men tender it,"
9881,LVI.,"They cleave to love once offer’d them; nor turn,"
9882,LVI.,"Like male-friends, clinging—true as iron, forsooth—"
9883,LVI.,"To each new stronger magnet! Were they thus,"
9884,LVI.,Our homes might hardly hold our rivals there.
9885,LVI.,"Accept the facts, friend; in this world of reals,"
9886,LVI.,"Ideals must give way. So look to Grace,—"
9887,LVI.,"Despite your protest, your true mate; and love"
9888,LVI.,In maids like her is limitless when won.
9889,LVI.,"You like her, too; now, now”—"
9890,LVI.,
9891,LVI.,
9892,LVII.,LVII.
9893,LVII.,
9894,LVII.,And so we talk’d.
9895,LVII.,I never thought it meant much; for we talk’d
9896,LVII.,"Of all things, almost; and, in play, at times,"
9897,LVII.,Would I indulge in hopes that he was right.
9898,LVII.,"Once too, far up in clouds, my fancy feign’d"
9899,LVII.,"To question if her friends, or she, would wish"
9900,LVII.,My calling to be hers. I scarce had dream’d
9901,LVII.,Of Elbert’s giving weight to whims like this.
9902,LVII.,Yet after that I mark’d him much with Grace;
9903,LVII.,"But naught surmised until, one time, he said:"
9904,LVII.,
9905,LVII.,"“All right, my Norman; I have talk’d with her;"
9906,LVII.,All but to tell her why I talk’d with her;
9907,LVII.,"And with her parents talk’d, and now they all"
9908,LVII.,Agree in praising plans of life like yours;
9909,LVII.,"These latter actually sighing oft,"
9910,LVII.,‘Would we but had a son for work like that!’
9911,LVII.,"So, friend, your way is clear.”"
9912,LVII.,
9913,LVII.,
9914,LVIII.,LVIII.
9915,LVIII.,
9916,LVIII.,But was it clear?—
9917,LVIII.,"So sure was it, that I could pluck this fruit?"
9918,LVIII.,"If sure, so sure the Eden open’d not"
9919,LVIII.,"To tempt, as well as bless me?—Could it be"
9920,LVIII.,That love could yet be mine?—The hope seem’d sweet;
9921,LVIII.,Yet strange!—Why strange?—The change?—
9922,LVIII.,Seem’d all change so?—
9923,LVIII.,Yet marriage?—Why did mortals marry then?—
9924,LVIII.,"For love, they said, for love. And what was love?"
9925,LVIII.,What more than liking well?—Whom liked I so;
9926,LVIII.,"And all in all, and always?—Edith?—What?—"
9927,LVIII.,"And liked her calling?—If I liked not that,"
9928,LVIII.,"I liked not her, not wholly. If not her,"
9929,LVIII.,Then liked I no one wholly; and my will
9930,LVIII.,"In love, as in all other earthly states,"
9931,LVIII.,"A choice must make,—take one of different boons,"
9932,LVIII.,And all imperfect. Why should not my love
9933,LVIII.,"Serve thus my judgment? Grace could stand this test,"
9934,LVIII.,And life with one like her so sweet could be!
9935,LVIII.,
9936,LVIII.,
9937,LIX.,LIX.
9938,LIX.,
9939,LIX.,I thought; but all my thinking stirr’d but thought
9940,LIX.,"Until, one time, I mused of other days;"
9941,LIX.,"How once, and at the merest hint of love,"
9942,LIX.,"My younger blood, like some just conquering host"
9943,LIX.,"That trembling hope bears on, would bound through veins"
9944,LIX.,That thrill’d and thrill’d while shook each trodden pulse;
9945,LIX.,"How, hot as deserts parch’d by swift simoons,"
9946,LIX.,"And wild as forests fell’d by sudden blasts,"
9947,LIX.,My frame would glow and bend at every breath
9948,LIX.,That tidings bore me of the soul I loved.
9949,LIX.,Love Grace did I?—How then had love been tamed!
9950,LIX.,"Mere self-control was it, that now, grown strong,"
9951,LIX.,"Had broken in, at last, that bounding blood,"
9952,LIX.,"And held the rein to joy?—Ah, self-control,"
9953,LIX.,"The rest rheumatic of a zest grown old,"
9954,LIX.,It came with time; but mine had come from care.
9955,LIX.,"Cold self-control, the curse of northern climes,"
9956,LIX.,"The artful despot of the Arctic heart,—"
9957,LIX.,"Before my summer scarce had warm’d me yet,"
9958,LIX.,Was it to freeze me with its wintry clutch
9959,LIX.,Of colorless indifference? chill and check
9960,LIX.,The springs of love till still’d in ice-like death?
9961,LIX.,
9962,LIX.,"Woe me! I sigh’d; but then, with nobler cause,"
9963,LIX.,"More nobly moved, I mourn’d that older love."
9964,LIX.,"It aye had come from regions far and pure,"
9965,LIX.,"From sacred heights of dream-land and desire,"
9966,LIX.,"And trailing light like Moses from the mount,"
9967,LIX.,"With one hand clasping mine, one pointing up"
9968,LIX.,"To something earthly, yet more near the sky."
9969,LIX.,It aye had thrill’d the throbbing veins it near’d
9970,LIX.,And made my brow flush proudly as the boor’s
9971,LIX.,"When king’s hands knight him, and he bears away"
9972,LIX.,Ennobled blood forever.—My mood though—
9973,LIX.,"This lax-limb’d, loitering, sisterly regard,"
9974,LIX.,"So cold, so calm, so cautious,—what was this?—"
9975,LIX.,"To call it love my spirit could have swoon’d,"
9976,LIX.,Shrunk like some parent’s when he first has found
9977,LIX.,His fair babe’s brain to be a gibbering blank.—
9978,LIX.,"And then, down underneath my deep despair,"
9979,LIX.,"Where heaved a sigh that loosen’d all my soul,"
9980,LIX.,Like some sweet kiss of sudden death that draws
9981,LIX.,"To sudden bliss, when men to heaven are snatch’d"
9982,LIX.,"From all the roar and rage of war, there came"
9983,LIX.,One hope for Edith;—and my shaken powers
9984,LIX.,Lost hold of Grace forever!
9985,LIX.,
9986,LIX.,
9987,LX.,LX.
9988,LX.,
9989,LX.,Still would doubt
9990,LX.,"Survive, and question if, when off my guard,"
9991,LX.,"In fancy rampant, I had Grace deceived"
9992,LX.,"As I had Elbert? Could it be, indeed,"
9993,LX.,"That I, who wish’d it not, had won her love?"
9994,LX.,"And if so, what?—The problem wore me thin."
9995,LX.,"My very wits, indeed, seem’d whittled off"
9996,LX.,To point and probe it.
9997,LX.,Strangely was it solved.
9998,LX.,"I dropp’d a vague surmise,—how two “should act,"
9999,LX.,"In case one loved, and love were not return’d.”"
10000,LX.,
10001,LX.,"She arch’d her answer with so rare a blush,"
10002,LX.,"That all my doubts dissolved; and, catching truth"
10003,LX.,"From hers contagious, like a boy confused,"
10004,LX.,"All fused in frankness bubbling o’er the brim,"
10005,LX.,I blurted out about my older love;
10006,LX.,"To root it out would root out love itself,"
10007,LX.,"And not to do so, leave none else a place."
10008,LX.,
10009,LX.,"“I love not you!” she cried, with look so changed,"
10010,LX.,My weight of shame had sunk me through the floor.
10011,LX.,"But, driven to words, like one some startle shocks,"
10012,LX.,I stammer’d “Elbert!”—and stood shock’d in truth;
10013,LX.,"For had I wrench’d it from her bodily,"
10014,LX.,Scarce redder had her flushing brow repell’d
10015,LX.,My wresting rudely such a secret thence.
10016,LX.,At one bound then my honor had return’d.
10017,LX.,"A bandit had I been, to force the spring"
10018,LX.,That lock’d her secret—but had spied her soul!—
10019,LX.,"And back to right it brought me. “Pardon, Grace,”"
10020,LX.,"I breathed, then hush’d: With strange and holy power,"
10021,LX.,"New-welling love seem’d fountain’d in my heart,"
10022,LX.,And shower’d and stream’d through all my thrilling veins;
10023,LX.,"And then I check’d it. She was not for me,"
10024,LX.,"Alas, unworthy! She was Elbert’s—all!"
10025,LX.,
10026,LX.,"“Grace,” breathed I, “you are doubly now my friend,"
10027,LX.,"And doubly dear, since Elbert’s dearest friend;"
10028,LX.,Thank Heaven that you have loved so true a man.
10029,LX.,I go to him.”
10030,LX.,"“Nay not to him,” she urged."
10031,LX.,
10032,LX.,"But I, though yielding to her, as it seem’d,"
10033,LX.,Made loose the letter for the sake of spirit;
10034,LX.,"Nor promised aught, unless he loved her not."
10035,LX.,
10036,LX.,
10037,LXI.,LXI.
10038,LXI.,
10039,LXI.,"But Elbert, found, the whole sweet truth confess’d,"
10040,LXI.,"With all his love for her so satisfied,"
10041,LXI.,"And all the sacrifice for me so clear,"
10042,LXI.,"I honor’d God the more from this, the hour"
10043,LXI.,I found His honor so encased in man.
10044,LXI.,"“Nay, thank me not,” he said. “You brought me her."
10045,LXI.,"Nor did I dream I loved her, ere I sought"
10046,LXI.,"Your cause to plead; and, aim’d for what it wills,"
10047,LXI.,"My will is wilful. There, you know the whole.”"
10048,LXI.,"And soon, as if he fear’d our former strife"
10049,LXI.,"Were not yet still’d, “And you, perhaps, were right"
10050,LXI.,"With Edith, too,” he said; “at least, were safe."
10051,LXI.,Hold still to truth. It yet may save us both.”
10052,LXI.,
10053,LXI.,
10054,LXII.,LXII.
10055,LXII.,
10056,LXII.,And then I learn’d—as many a friend has learn’d—
10057,LXII.,"Who with them strove my joy for them to share,"
10058,LXII.,"How much more joy was theirs, when theirs alone."
10059,LXII.,But this could scarcely turn my thought aside
10060,LXII.,"From self, left lonelier now than e’er before."
10061,LXII.,I strove to drown my grief in work. The work
10062,LXII.,Was but a worm’s that eats from day to day
10063,LXII.,"The morrow’s bed, at morning dragging on"
10064,LXII.,"A soulless trunk, through troubles void of hope."
10065,LXII.,
10066,LXII.,My soul to startled sighs was roused alone
10067,LXII.,"When Edith cross’d my vision. Then my mood,"
10068,LXII.,"As gloom would gather round again, would grieve"
10069,LXII.,"To think, in sorting souls, fate bungled so,"
10070,LXII.,"And let our traits be judged of by our trades,—"
10071,LXII.,The dusty imprint of the things we touch.
10072,LXII.,"“As well,” cried I, “to judge of winds of heaven,"
10073,LXII.,"By bogs they brush, or fogs they bear away!"
10074,LXII.,"We two that so could trust each other’s hearts,"
10075,LXII.,"Why should we not join hearts, and leave to them"
10076,LXII.,"The hands? If wiser than the world we were,"
10077,LXII.,"Why should we act, forsooth, in worldly ways?"
10078,LXII.,What need that all should don the uniform
10079,LXII.,That fits men for the social march of fools?
10080,LXII.,"What need?—Ah me,” I thought, “all need, indeed,"
10081,LXII.,If one wish influence in the world or church.—
10082,LXII.,Or church!—Must it then crucify the soul
10083,LXII.,To save appearances? the body? form?
10084,LXII.,The Christ gave up all these to save the soul.
10085,LXII.,"’Tis treason when His churches join the world,"
10086,LXII.,"And courting smiles from bigotry appeased,"
10087,LXII.,"And grinning hell that holds the whole its own,"
10088,LXII.,Preach up the crucifixion of the soul
10089,LXII.,"To save the body, save the outward form."
10090,LXII.,"A church is His no more, whose rites or creeds"
10091,LXII.,Keep souls untrue to truth within that shows
10092,LXII.,"God’s tempering there, the touch that makes man man.”"
10093,LXII.,
10094,LXII.,
10095,LXIII.,LXIII.
10096,LXIII.,
10097,LXIII.,"I swore it should not be, it could not be;"
10098,LXIII.,"No life could so be cleansed,—by wringing thence"
10099,LXIII.,The blood that warms the heart; no face made pure
10100,LXIII.,By turning pale the blush of beauty cast
10101,LXIII.,By shadows where sweet love goes in and out.
10102,LXIII.,"Love, love should never be a slave, but free.—"
10103,LXIII.,"“Come, Edith!”—Then I question’d, Would she come?—"
10104,LXIII.,"Nay, not to my life. Mine must go to hers."
10105,LXIII.,"But this, mine could not,—could do nothing there;—"
10106,LXIII.,And would not!—Whence then sprang my call to her?—
10107,LXIII.,"If not from reason, from my wish, forsooth.—"
10108,LXIII.,My wish for what?—for her?—as now she was?—
10109,LXIII.,Not so; but rather might be.—Whence then sprang
10110,LXIII.,"This ‘might be’?—whence, alas, but from myself,"
10111,LXIII.,As I kept moulding it within my soul?
10112,LXIII.,"Why rail’d I, then, against the church and world?—"
10113,LXIII.,"Not these alone, but I would have her changed."
10114,LXIII.,These all but echoed back my own soul’s voice;
10115,LXIII.,"And yet, augmented by the voice of all,"
10116,LXIII.,"In heeding them, I heeded not myself,"
10117,LXIII.,"But something greater, grander than myself."
10118,LXIII.,"For if a single man may image God,"
10119,LXIII.,Then many men who join their partial gifts
10120,LXIII.,"And parted wisdom,—till the whole become"
10121,LXIII.,"Not merely human but humanity’s,—"
10122,LXIII.,May watch our ways and keep them circumspect
10123,LXIII.,With eyes that often wellnigh stand for His
10124,LXIII.,Who still more fully in mankind than man
10125,LXIII.,Rules over truth in each through truth in all.
10126,LXIII.,"Why term me slave, then, when I serve my kind?—"
10127,LXIII.,"Through serving it, I best may serve, as well,"
10128,LXIII.,My godlier self!—Let general thought take shape;
10129,LXIII.,What better can incarnate sovereignty?
10130,LXIII.,What stir to nobler dreams or grander deeds?
10131,LXIII.,"The soul in reverence may kneel to it,"
10132,LXIII.,"Yield all to it.—So may my neighbors reign,"
10133,LXIII.,"And I may be their slave, yet own myself;"
10134,LXIII.,"And deify, while I defy my pride!"
10135,LXIII.,
10136,LXIII.,
10137,LXIV.,LXIV.
10138,LXIV.,
10139,LXIV.,"A new conversion, say you?—call it so."
10140,LXIV.,"The truth converts one oft, if he be true."
10141,LXIV.,"The true man loves his own, and fights for it;"
10142,LXIV.,"And, since his own is little and God’s is large,"
10143,LXIV.,He often fights to fall. Yet ranks on high
10144,LXIV.,"Now throng with heroes, whose too slender blades"
10145,LXIV.,Were wielded but for slender causes once;
10146,LXIV.,"Nor sheathed, ere flying shatter’d from their grasp,"
10147,LXIV.,Till truth they fought had proven too strong for them.
10148,LXIV.,"Then, when they knew themselves, and knew the truth,"
10149,LXIV.,"And knew its mercy too, they loved the truth,"
10150,LXIV.,"And came to be its champions, evermore."
10151,LXIV.,"So now with me: rebellious though I was,"
10152,LXIV.,Rebellion wrought my rescue. Truth triumphant
10153,LXIV.,Enlisted duty for a loyalty
10154,LXIV.,That made all life seem lordlike. Work began.
10155,LXIV.,"Thank God, we all have heads above our hearts;"
10156,LXIV.,"And, if we let them reason with us well,"
10157,LXIV.,They rule us for our best.

10160,LXV.,LXV.
10161,LXV.,
10162,LXV.,"What Elbert wish’d,"
10163,LXV.,"When first I cross’d the sea, was more than wrought."
10164,LXV.,"I brought back not alone what books could give,"
10165,LXV.,"But in myself a sense of others’ wants,—"
10166,LXV.,For in my heart a wondrous wealth of love;
10167,LXV.,"Ay, wealth it was; though, like the ore in mines,"
10168,LXV.,It only proved that that which lived had died.
10169,LXV.,"What though my life, complete with her alone,"
10170,LXV.,Seem’d always rent? a weight of broken quartz
10171,LXV.,That only gleam’d where it had fractur’d been?
10172,LXV.,That weight was wealth that sparkled back to greet
10173,LXV.,Each glance of sunshine.
10174,LXV.,Thus I found that love
10175,LXV.,"At times may prove a treasure even dead,"
10176,LXV.,If dead enough in spirits yet alive.
10177,LXV.,"Mine, thwarted so, had made me more the man"
10178,LXV.,"That Elbert wish’d,—a man for all mankind;—"
10179,LXV.,No special pleader for a special class
10180,LXV.,Whose grasping greed crowds out the general good;—
10181,LXV.,But one who pleads for all fair rights for all.
10182,LXV.,Nor would I bide content with utter’d words.
10183,LXV.,"Too often, these, when widest welcomed, wake"
10184,LXV.,But echoes brief as breath from which they spring.
10185,LXV.,I craved the mission less of roaring waves
10186,LXV.,"Than of the rare wrought shells that, evermore,"
10187,LXV.,"When storms are gone, suggest their living presence."
10188,LXV.,
10189,LXV.,
10190,LXVI.,LXVI.
10191,LXVI.,
10192,LXVI.,Anon it happen’d that through others’ hands
10193,LXVI.,"My tales, pour’d forth to voice my loneliness"
10194,LXVI.,"In echoing talk and song, were framed in plays,"
10195,LXVI.,"And then were phrased in music; and, in time,"
10196,LXVI.,Arose like sighings of a human wind
10197,LXVI.,"Above a human sea, while, all about,"
10198,LXVI.,"There swept, like surgings of a rhythmic surf,"
10199,LXVI.,The shifting scenes and singers of the stage.
10200,LXVI.,"And, chief of all the singers in those throngs,"
10201,LXVI.,Who best of all could body forth the truth
10202,LXVI.,That most of all had seem’d to be inspired
10203,LXVI.,"By Edith’s influence, while in all I thought"
10204,LXVI.,"Her love had ever lured expression on,"
10205,LXVI.,Was her own self.
10206,LXVI.,
10207,LXVI.,
10208,LXVII.,LXVII.
10209,LXVII.,
10210,LXVII.,But love outstrips my tale.
10211,LXVII.,"Erelong, from shores where surged that surf of song,"
10212,LXVII.,"Like gems the ocean casts upon its coast,"
10213,LXVII.,About me lay a growing store of wealth.
10214,LXVII.,"And then, with broaden’d means, led on to push"
10215,LXVII.,"Toward broaden’d purposes, I spoke and wrote;"
10216,LXVII.,"And found, anon, while aiding here and there"
10217,LXVII.,"Where aid was rare, wide opening to my view,"
10218,LXVII.,A worthiest mission in this new reform
10219,LXVII.,That seeks to make the server and the served
10220,LXVII.,"Walk hand in hand, while wage gives way to share,"
10221,LXVII.,"And, furthering all men to their furthest due,"
10222,LXVII.,Thus lifts the low and lost.

10225,LXVIII.,LXVIII.
10226,LXVIII.,
10227,LXVIII.,"At last, one day,"
10228,LXVIII.,"There came a letter from our bureau’s head,"
10229,LXVIII.,"With it, another, sent him, so he wrote,"
10230,LXVIII.,"“By some enthusiast, a character—"
10231,LXVIII.,"A woman, and a woman too of mind;"
10232,LXVIII.,"And yet, withal, who had been strangely led,"
10233,LXVIII.,"Through doubtful ways, he thought, toward doubtful ends,"
10234,LXVIII.,"Till doubts had wrought reaction,—as when clouds"
10235,LXVIII.,"That course on clouds, at last, bring lightnings forth"
10236,LXVIII.,"That clear them off. And now her vision, clear’d,"
10237,LXVIII.,"Had found within her soul a wish to work,—"
10238,LXVIII.,"In new ways truly for a cause like ours,—"
10239,LXVIII.,"For us and with us. But I held her note,"
10240,LXVIII.,She dwelt near by me: could I visit her?
10241,LXVIII.,And give my judgment then?”
10242,LXVIII.,
10243,LXVIII.,
10244,LXIX.,LXIX.
10245,LXIX.,
10246,LXIX.,"This note, so sent,"
10247,LXIX.,"Was—would you guess it?—Edith’s. What she wrote,"
10248,LXIX.,Weighs love against all liking to this hour.
10249,LXIX.,"All thrill’d with hope, yet trembling for my fate,"
10250,LXIX.,I spell’d out all her tale:—“Her sire—his aims—
10251,LXIX.,And her fulfilment of them—her success—
10252,LXIX.,"Earth seem’d a kingdom prostrate at her feet,"
10253,LXIX.,"And she, a queen; alas, but, like a queen,"
10254,LXIX.,"Was doom’d to hold a throne where rivals came,"
10255,LXIX.,"To spy her weakness out, and wrest away"
10256,LXIX.,A power that could be kept by power alone.—
10257,LXIX.,How sad for woman when her hopes were based
10258,LXIX.,"On practice that must all her heart conceal,"
10259,LXIX.,That must be conquering ever or be crush’d!
10260,LXIX.,"At first her love for art had kept her up,—"
10261,LXIX.,"And for success, and for a sister dear,"
10262,LXIX.,"Who shared her earnings, who, while cheer’d the crowds,"
10263,LXIX.,"At last, had died, and left her all alone."
10264,LXIX.,"And, after that, her soul had loathed applause,"
10265,LXIX.,"Had found her nature so belied, misjudged,"
10266,LXIX.,"Her life the embodiment of hollow sound,"
10267,LXIX.,"And all surroundings echoing back but sound,"
10268,LXIX.,"Chill admiration in the place of love,"
10269,LXIX.,"Her friends but flatterers, and herself unknown."
10270,LXIX.,
10271,LXIX.,"“With this, her world had grown so hard, so parch’d,"
10272,LXIX.,Without one source affording sympathy—
10273,LXIX.,She took no credit to herself for aught;
10274,LXIX.,"The weakest sigh that could have heaved a breast,"
10275,LXIX.,"A dying breast, had crack’d so dry a crust—"
10276,LXIX.,"She rose, one morn, and swore to free her soul,"
10277,LXIX.,Let pent-up love in softening currents flow
10278,LXIX.,"Till something human, ay, and heavenly, too,"
10279,LXIX.,Were nurtured by the wish from which it sprang.
10280,LXIX.,
10281,LXIX.,“She could not work now for herself alone;
10282,LXIX.,For she had learn’d that all life’s purposes
10283,LXIX.,Are held like lenses that a soul may use
10284,LXIX.,To gather in heaven’s light and flash it round
10285,LXIX.,"Upon its world illumin’d; or, not so,—"
10286,LXIX.,"If turn’d on self,—to but inflame and dim"
10287,LXIX.,Its own self-centered vision. So she now
10288,LXIX.,"One only purpose knew,—to pledge her gifts"
10289,LXIX.,"To those who most might need them; and she came,"
10290,LXIX.,"With all she was or hoped she yet might be,"
10291,LXIX.,"Her gifts of nature and her skill in art,"
10292,LXIX.,"To work for us, whose aims were plann’d so well,"
10293,LXIX.,"To further all men to their furthest goals,"
10294,LXIX.,And lift the low and lost.”
10295,LXIX.,
10296,LXIX.,
10297,LXX.,LXX.
10298,LXX.,
10299,LXX.,"And then I rode,"
10300,LXX.,"As fast as trains could take me; and I wrote,"
10301,LXX.,"Like one intoxicated, from the inn:"
10302,LXX.,“The bureau’s agent here abides your wish”;
10303,LXX.,"And, signing not my name, awaited thus"
10304,LXX.,The welcome sure to seem more sweet than life.
10305,LXX.,It came. I went.
10306,LXX.,
10307,LXX.,"“You?” Edith cried, “and whence?”"
10308,LXX.,“From whence?” I said. “Each slightest spark of good
10309,LXX.,"Flies upward, and the heaven returns it where"
10310,LXX.,It fires the most?—and where were tinder found
10311,LXX.,Like my heart?”
10312,LXX.,“Why is this?” I heard; “My note—
10313,LXX.,Did it miscarry?—Would you thwart me now—
10314,LXX.,"Or, though my gifts could aid them, do they wish"
10315,LXX.,No help from me?—My heart was fix’d on it.”
10316,LXX.,
10317,LXX.,"“On my cause,” breathed I. “Did you never think"
10318,LXX.,That work with them would make you work with me?”
10319,LXX.,
10320,LXX.,“Why think of that?” she ask’d.—“Enough to know
10321,LXX.,I sought my own work here.”
10322,LXX.,
10323,LXX.,"“Why, Edith, friend,”"
10324,LXX.,I answer’d—“Why could not your work be mine?
10325,LXX.,"What parts us now? What though, like mine, your soul"
10326,LXX.,"Had come to look down life’s long dreary vista,"
10327,LXX.,And watch yourself alone. Why bide alone?
10328,LXX.,"I, I, at least, through all these years have seen—"
10329,LXX.,"Not you yourself, for that too dear had been!—"
10330,LXX.,"But I have seen a vision, seeming you"
10331,LXX.,"Within the far horizon of my hopes,"
10332,LXX.,"The sweet mirage before me. Now, at last,"
10333,LXX.,I know those misty outlines veil’d the truth;
10334,LXX.,It must have meant that you would yet be found—
10335,LXX.,That we should meet. Heaven surely meant it so.”
10336,LXX.,
10337,LXX.,
10338,LXXI.,LXXI.
10339,LXXI.,
10340,LXXI.,"Her mien had chang’d; and yet she ask’d again,"
10341,LXXI.,“But how with Grace? I thought”—
10342,LXXI.,"“Alas,” I said,"
10343,LXXI.,"“With your dear spirit thron’d above my love,"
10344,LXXI.,"What were I but a traitor, wedding Grace?"
10345,LXXI.,"This heart was yours, your dwelling-place alone."
10346,LXXI.,"Nay, now I do not come to give it you:"
10347,LXXI.,It only opens to an owner old.
10348,LXXI.,How sacredly I guarded it for you!—
10349,LXXI.,"A holy place, though there, above the shrine,"
10350,LXXI.,"The niche was empty. Ah, has earth seem’d rude?"
10351,LXXI.,Some reason was there; surely some there was.
10352,LXXI.,"We war with Providence, who war with life."
10353,LXXI.,We seek to mould our own existence out;
10354,LXXI.,"But life, best made, is mainly for us made."
10355,LXXI.,"Each passing circumstance, a tool of heaven,"
10356,LXXI.,"Grates by to smooth some edge of character,"
10357,LXXI.,And model manhood into better shape.
10358,LXXI.,"Has nought been wrought with you? Ah, idol mine,"
10359,LXXI.,"You living image of all hope, would God,"
10360,LXXI.,"Love’s niche were fill’d, love’s altar stood complete!”"
10361,LXXI.,
10362,LXXI.,
10363,LXXII.,LXXII.
10364,LXXII.,
10365,LXXII.,"Then Edith lean’d her face against her hand,"
10366,LXXII.,And slowly came the words that seem’d so dear:
10367,LXXII.,"“It may be, Norman, may—I know—I feel—"
10368,LXXII.,"It must be earth, so roughly handling one,"
10369,LXXII.,Should round experience for some wise design.
10370,LXXII.,Yet this—it cannot be—how can it?—nay—
10371,LXXII.,For me you come—and you? your voice I hear?
10372,LXXII.,"No echo void, oft, oft so sweet in dreams?—"
10373,LXXII.,Nor now to wake me?—Nay I trust. You may—
10374,LXXII.,’Twill stray no more—take back your wanderer.”
10375,LXXII.,
10376,LXXII.,"“My wanderer!” I answer’d, when I could;"
10377,LXXII.,"“Ah Edith, you but wander’d as the lamb;"
10378,LXXII.,"My spotless, worldling-mediator, you!—"
10379,LXXII.,It wander’d?—yes; it cross’d a threshold chill;
10380,LXXII.,A proud cathedral enter’d; there found one
10381,LXXII.,"Too pleased with what he had, to gaze outside."
10382,LXXII.,To him those arches low seem’d high as heaven;
10383,LXXII.,"And all the sweet and sunny air without,"
10384,LXXII.,"When strain’d through stain’d and smoke-wreathed window-panes,"
10385,LXXII.,Gleam’d lurid as were hell. This man spied you:
10386,LXXII.,He saw you shun him—leave him. He pursued—
10387,LXXII.,"Out, past the doorway—and he found God’s world"
10388,LXXII.,So much more broad than walls named after Him!”
10389,LXXII.,
10390,LXXII.,
10391,LXXIII.,LXXIII.
10392,LXXIII.,
10393,LXXIII.,"“And Norman,” said she, “think you, evermore,"
10394,LXXIII.,"Recalling you, the worldling could forget"
10395,LXXIII.,How walls exclusive could exclude not love?
10396,LXXIII.,"Or, love rejecting, gain from all the world,"
10397,LXXIII.,"Though brimm’d with but applause, one draft so sweet?—"
10398,LXXIII.,"But then earth held such promise yet, so lured;"
10399,LXXIII.,How could I know that merely sighs there were
10400,LXXIII.,Could thrill me more than all its thunders could?
10401,LXXIII.,"Ah, did I love you then, so loves he heaven"
10402,LXXIII.,Who has not courage yet to leave the world.
10403,LXXIII.,"I might have left it never; but, you know,"
10404,LXXIII.,"That sister mine—At last, life meant but this,—"
10405,LXXIII.,"To envy that cold tomb, all night, all day,"
10406,LXXIII.,"That held her only.—Norman, pardon me:"
10407,LXXIII.,"Such woe, such loneliness,—ah, strange was it"
10408,LXXIII.,"That oft then I recall’d your form, your words?"
10409,LXXIII.,And when I render’d forth upon the stage
10410,LXXIII.,"Scenes you had visioned, phrases you had fram’d,"
10411,LXXIII.,"That then I came to do as you would do,"
10412,LXXIII.,And think as you would think?—or that my tongue
10413,LXXIII.,"Should linger o’er your language, as o’er sweets"
10414,LXXIII.,"Re-tasted still again?—or that, anon,"
10415,LXXIII.,"Those accents ardent with your own dear aims,"
10416,LXXIII.,Should fire mine own to ardor?—or that then
10417,LXXIII.,"My soul should flash forth light that flamed within,"
10418,LXXIII.,"And tracing far the rays that sped from it,"
10419,LXXIII.,Should find here”—
10420,LXXIII.,
10421,LXXIII.,"“One to help you, friend?” I asked—"
10422,LXXIII.,“Then let us both thank heaven that made us weak.
10423,LXXIII.,"So may a mortal pair bide, each to each,"
10424,LXXIII.,"Both priest and partner; like the church, their home;"
10425,LXXIII.,For what are churches here but chosen courts
10426,LXXIII.,"Of One pure Spirit, moving all to love?"
10427,LXXIII.,"And, think you, writ or vestment, art or arch,"
10428,LXXIII.,"Can image Him, or His domain unbound?"
10429,LXXIII.,"Nay, trust my word, we worship Him the best,"
10430,LXXIII.,"When two or three together, loving truth"
10431,LXXIII.,"And one another, thus repeat, once more,"
10432,LXXIII.,"An incarnation, imitating Christ”"
10433,LXXIII.,
10434,LXXIII.,
10435,LXXIV.,LXXIV.
10436,LXXIV.,
10437,LXXIV.,"“I catch it, Norman,” cried she, “the ideal!"
10438,LXXIV.,"Henceforth our aim be this,—the art of life."
10439,LXXIV.,I saw it not before: the stage of spirit
10440,LXXIV.,So much more broad is than the stage of sense!
10441,LXXIV.,"Comes on the soul now, actor, all divine,"
10442,LXXIV.,"At play no longer; nay, but shadowing forth"
10443,LXXIV.,A love complete that personates a God!
10444,LXXIV.,And what love is complete that walks alone?”
10445,LXXIV.,
10446,LXXIV.,"“None,” answer’d I. “In true love, hand in hand,"
10447,LXXIV.,Each leads his like. For this the whole world waits.
10448,LXXIV.,"It waits for love,—why say not love like ours?"
10449,LXXIV.,"When souls touch souls, they touch the springs of life;"
10450,LXXIV.,"For them the veils of sense are drawn aside,"
10451,LXXIV.,"Are burn’d away in radiance divine,"
10452,LXXIV.,The while their spirit’s contact starts afresh
10453,LXXIV.,"The electric flash that scores new glory here,"
10454,LXXIV.,And lights the lines of being back to God.
10455,LXXIV.,"Then, with their whole existences renew’d,"
10456,LXXIV.,"Far up these lines, the souls that thus commune,"
10457,LXXIV.,"Discern anon that sacred home on high,"
10458,LXXIV.,Where boundless rest is blest by boundless love
10459,LXXIV.,And dreams the dreams of bounty absolute.—
10460,LXXIV.,"They find that home, whence issue floods of light,"
10461,LXXIV.,"Which, flowing forth from white mysterious heights,"
10462,LXXIV.,Flame down and flash and burst anon in sparks
10463,LXXIV.,That star the dark through all life’s firmament;—
10464,LXXIV.,"They find that home, whence whirl the cycles wide"
10465,LXXIV.,"Where all the wastes of nature fuse and form,"
10466,LXXIV.,"And all the things that thought can touch take shape,"
10467,LXXIV.,"Until the restless wheels of matter, roll’d"
10468,LXXIV.,"Through roadways worn to waste by speeding years,"
10469,LXXIV.,"At last in fatal friction fire themselves,"
10470,LXXIV.,And light returns to light from whence it sprang.
10471,LXXIV.,"Through all, where souls commune with central love,"
10472,LXXIV.,"They stay secure, awaiting birth or death;"
10473,LXXIV.,"The Spring that starts the blossom blown to fall,"
10474,LXXIV.,Or Fall that drops the seed that springs afresh.
10475,LXXIV.,"They watch nor fear whatever change evolve,—"
10476,LXXIV.,"The splendor grand of epochs borne to waste,"
10477,LXXIV.,"The ruin wild of times that end in law,"
10478,LXXIV.,"The monarch mail’d whose lustre dims his folk,"
10479,LXXIV.,The people’s guns whose echoes hush their king.
10480,LXXIV.,What though dark clouds loom up and storms descend?

11176,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,The book founds its conclusions on a study of the action of the human
11177,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"mind when obtaining and expressing truth, as this action has been"
11178,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"revealed through the most recent investigations of physiological,"
11179,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"psychological, and psychic research; and the freshness and originality"
11180,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,of the presentation is acknowledged and commended by such authorities as
11181,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"Dr. J. Mark Baldwin, Professor of Psychology in Johns Hopkins University,"
11182,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,who says that its psychological position is “new and valuable”; Dr. W.
11183,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"T. Harris, late United States Commissioner of Education and the foremost"

11188,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,
11189,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"The first and, perhaps, the most important achievement of the book"
11190,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,is to show that the _fact_ of _inspiration_ can be _demonstrated
11191,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"scientifically_; in other words, that the inner subconscious mind _can_"
11192,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,be influenced irrespective of influences exerted through the eyes and the
11193,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"ears, _i.e._, by what one sees or hears. In connection with this fact it"
11194,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"is also shown that, when the mind is thus inwardly or inspirationally"
11195,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"influenced, as, for example, in hypnotism, the influence is _suggestive_"
11196,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"and _not dictatorial_. Not only so, but such faith as it is natural"
11197,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,and right that a rational being should exercise can be stimulated and
11198,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,developed in only the degree in which the text of a sacred book is
11199,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,characterized by the very vagueness and variety of meaning and statement
11200,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,which the higher criticism of the Bible has brought to light. The book
11201,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,traces these to the operation and requirements of the human mind through
11202,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,which inspiration is received and to which it is imparted. Whatever
11203,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"inspires must appear to be, in some way, beyond the grasp of him who"
11204,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"communicates it, and can make him who hears it _think_ and _train him to"
11205,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"think_, in the degree only in which it is not comprehensive or complete;"
11206,BOOKS BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND,"but merely, like everything else in nature, illustrative of that portion"
