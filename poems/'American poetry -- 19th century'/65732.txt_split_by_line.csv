183,(A MINOR.),The glory of woman is crowned by her hair?
184,(A MINOR.),"The muse is uncertain, but rather prefers"
185,(A MINOR.),"The quills of the hedgehog with some kind of burrs,"
186,(A MINOR.),Whose clinging tenacity savors of what
187,(A MINOR.),When speaking of woman is never forgot;—
188,(A MINOR.),Which scatter a shower of deadliest darts
189,(A MINOR.),"From arsenal copious of stingings and smarts,"
190,(A MINOR.),O’er optics that twinkle with serpent-like arts.
191,(A MINOR.),"So, coming at random, unblest by the bans,"

195,(A MINOR.),On bosoms of granite was badgered and scolded.
196,(A MINOR.),"The grannies in order to properly breed it,"
197,(A MINOR.),"At outset like christians endeavored to feed it,"
198,(A MINOR.),"But vainly; for, scorning all patent-right fixtures,"
199,(A MINOR.),"Soft pap it rejected, and baby-milk mixtures."
200,(A MINOR.),"Away with your catnip, ye wrinkled viragos!"
201,(A MINOR.),"Your soothing concoctions, your sops and your sagos—"
202,(A MINOR.),"Give syrups of pepper, not weakly diluted,"
203,(A MINOR.),And waters of Marah—they’re charmingly suited
204,(A MINOR.),"Impulses to quicken, not easy computed."
205,(A MINOR.),"For solids use thistles, and thorns, and rough brambles—"
206,(A MINOR.),The fodder that asses collect in their rambles.
207,(A MINOR.),"A cabbage to give it agreeable savor,"
208,(A MINOR.),"Is found in the meadows, of suitable flavor."
209,(A MINOR.),"Thus forage and fluids, with caution selected,"
210,(A MINOR.),"’Tis like, in the temper, will ripen reflected."
211,(A MINOR.),One species of felines in manner befitting
212,(A MINOR.),Will show in the impulse for scratching and spitting.
213,(A MINOR.),"Another polemic Grimalkin, I’ll venture,"
214,(A MINOR.),"Peculiar sensation will wake by its stench, or"
215,(A MINOR.),"There’s nothing in breeding, and feeding, and teaching,"
216,(A MINOR.),As doctors in physics and ethics are preaching.
217,(A MINOR.),"Such regimen followed, with strictest attention,"

786,FOURTH.,"Where hairy lips should never scratch our noses,"
787,FOURTH.,Or kisses paint our damask cheeks like roses—

811,FOURTH.,"Have you observed how from the first beginning,"

813,FOURTH.,"That, while confused and blind with fright and wonder"
814,FOURTH.,He might the more completely them under?
815,FOURTH.,And ever since contrives to lord it o’er ’em
816,FOURTH.,By holding up that “_lapsus in torrorum_”
817,FOURTH.,With full intent I solemnly believe
818,FOURTH.,To terminate our sex at mother Eve;
819,FOURTH.,And equally perpetuate his own
820,FOURTH.,By forcing us to carry boys alone?
821,FOURTH.,Whether ’twas accident or nice design
822,FOURTH.,That ultimately saved the female line
823,FOURTH.,"And keeps it, holy records fail to show."
824,FOURTH.,"Perhaps, one of the “lost arts”—this I know;—"
825,FOURTH.,"Such confidence have I in female cunning,—"
826,FOURTH.,If woman willed to keep the girls-a-running
827,FOURTH.,"And stupid man refused his aid about it,"
828,FOURTH.,She’d find some easy way to do without it.
829,FOURTH.,"Retaliation is a law of “natur,”"
830,FOURTH.,"Which was decreed by the benign Creator,"
831,FOURTH.,"Or stated by some holy commentator,"
832,FOURTH.,And must be right. I therefore recommend
833,FOURTH.,Such measures be adopted as shall end
834,FOURTH.,"In making man, the author of our woes,"
835,FOURTH.,"A “_lusus naturae_,” the pride of shows."
836,FOURTH.,No more let children male encumber earth

839,FOURTH.,"In resolution one, you may perceive"
840,FOURTH.,What mighty amphitheatre we leave

842,FOURTH.,Is guerdon sure to cunning and finesse.
843,FOURTH.,Lest some its secret sense may fail to gain
844,FOURTH.,"Permit your humble servant to explain,"
845,FOURTH.,Nor deem the “_modus operandi_” vain.
846,FOURTH.,
847,FOURTH.,"A tale, for illustration good and fit,"
848,FOURTH.,"Is somewhere told; I think, in holy writ."
849,FOURTH.,A righteous man whose name in scripture rings
850,FOURTH.,"As king of concubines and other things,"

852,FOURTH.,With ornaments of gold and silver mostly.
853,FOURTH.,To that Jehovah whom his race adored
854,FOURTH.,"The house was deeded, hoping ’twould afford"
855,FOURTH.,"Free grazing in the pastures of the Lord,"
856,FOURTH.,"The transit smooth o’er Jordan’s stormy billows,"
857,FOURTH.,And pardon gain for sundry peccadilloes.
858,FOURTH.,"For seven years, reported dry and dusty,"
859,FOURTH.,"Thousands of men, with sinews strong and lusty,"
860,FOURTH.,"Labored like beasts at timber, stone, and plaster"
861,FOURTH.,"To rear its column, wall, and huge pilaster."
862,FOURTH.,"Yet tho’ no stick, or stone, or bolt, or rivet,"
863,FOURTH.,"Did Solomon’s own labor give it,"
864,FOURTH.,"(Or, if he did, no writer ever said it)"
865,FOURTH.,"He cunningly contrived to gain the credit,"
866,FOURTH.,"Of its erection. Thus, to work by proxy"
867,FOURTH.,Seems sanctioned by the highest orthodoxy.
868,FOURTH.,"And is procedure, if come-at-able,"
869,FOURTH.,With woman’s nature quite compatible;
870,FOURTH.,"Thereby, from labor we may gain exemption"
871,FOURTH.,"And so inaugurate our great redemption,"
872,FOURTH.,"When woman to her proper “sphere” promoted,"
873,FOURTH.,On husbands shoulders shall be raised and toted.
874,FOURTH.,I hate this silly rant on “woman’s sphere!”
875,FOURTH.,"’Tis simply nauseous to lib’ral ear,"
876,FOURTH.,The very word’s disgustingly offensive
877,FOURTH.,Suggesting bounds to woman’s plans extensive;
878,FOURTH.,"Implying still, whatever one’s pursuit is,"
879,FOURTH.,Existence wasted in a _round_ of duties.
880,FOURTH.,An Irish bull—a term chimerical!
881,FOURTH.,She has no sphere—she’s hemispherical!
882,FOURTH.,
883,FOURTH.,’Twere vain to iterate in word specific
884,FOURTH.,The long complaint not gentle nor pacific
885,FOURTH.,Of which the vixen’s fancy proved prolific.
886,FOURTH.,For similes affecting or destructive
887,FOURTH.,"And wild hyperboles of scorn productive,"
888,FOURTH.,She gleaned the country o’er from snowy Maine
889,FOURTH.,To verdant Alabama’s flow’ry plain:
890,FOURTH.,"Ransacked antiquity’s moth-eaten store,"
891,FOURTH.,And drained the fount of legendary lore
892,FOURTH.,For intermittent precedents to prove
893,FOURTH.,The inutility of human love.
894,FOURTH.,She spawn’d forth words with vast facility
895,FOURTH.,"And talked with ceasely volubility,"
896,FOURTH.,Guiltless of reason or civility;
897,FOURTH.,Affording thus a patent wool-dyed sample
898,FOURTH.,Of teaching both by precept and example.
899,FOURTH.,And yet this brawling of such heady creatures
900,FOURTH.,Is not without some few redeeming features:
901,FOURTH.,"For, tho’ the utt’rance is a public curse"
902,FOURTH.,Suppression might induce condition worse.
903,FOURTH.,Surplus vitality demanding vent
904,FOURTH.,In rampant caracoling thus is spent;
905,FOURTH.,"And so perchance avoids a sad explosion,"
906,FOURTH.,By action too prevents as bad corrosion;
907,FOURTH.,"Since woman, made of matter much refined,"
908,FOURTH.,"Is keen finesse and subtlety combined,"
909,FOURTH.,"And greatly prone, as seen in state primeval,"
910,FOURTH.,To pioneer in taste of good and evil.
911,FOURTH.,In proof consult what ev’ryone supposes
912,FOURTH.,A veritable tale by holy Moses.

915,FOURTH.,"While yet the panting bosom thrill’d and quiver’d,"
916,FOURTH.,"At once there rose greetings loud and long,"
917,FOURTH.,"Commingled bass and treble, from that throng."
918,FOURTH.,Then might you see advancing on that stage
919,FOURTH.,"A tott’ring form becrowned with snow of age,"
920,FOURTH.,"On whom the thoughtful gazed with bated breath,"
921,FOURTH.,As one might gaze on wrinkled bride of death:
922,FOURTH.,"For, hoary hairs, colleagued with folly,"
923,FOURTH.,Must ever wake emotions melancholy.
924,FOURTH.,
925,FOURTH.,"But ah! when aged women takes to soaring,"
926,FOURTH.,"And, motherhood forgetting, and ignoring"
927,FOURTH.,"“The divinity that doth hedge” her round,"
928,FOURTH.,"In strange and unbecoming walks is found,"
929,FOURTH.,"Deserting sacred joys of hearth and home,"
930,FOURTH.,Delighting in forbidden paths to roam.
931,FOURTH.,"A gloom o’erhangs the soul, like fun’ral pall."
932,FOURTH.,"Still, not such horror fell on all"
933,FOURTH.,"For, certes, loud and lengthened was the call"
934,FOURTH.,When saintly mother Katy Bantam rose
935,FOURTH.,"With “healing on her tongue,” corns on her toes,"
936,FOURTH.,And upward rubbed her venerable nose:
937,FOURTH.,Then solemnly her spectacles adjusted
938,FOURTH.,As if the nation had that moment “busted”.
939,FOURTH.,A harmless old gray hen who took to crowing
940,FOURTH.,"With ne’er a comb or caudal feather showing,"
941,FOURTH.,Her spouse attained distinction in the nation
942,FOURTH.,"Expelling foxes from all public station,"
943,FOURTH.,When cheek by jowl he rode with freest rider
944,FOURTH.,The rallying cry “log cabin and hard cider;”
945,FOURTH.,(That reckless charge and wild triumphant yell
946,FOURTH.,The sage of Lindenwald remembered well)
947,FOURTH.,"And after, much affected gallopading"
948,FOURTH.,"On abolition hobby, “nigger-raiding;”"
949,FOURTH.,"Which happening the crowd to please,"
950,FOURTH.,Made “hobbying” a family disease.
951,FOURTH.,His dame for notoriety then itching
952,FOURTH.,"Was worried from propriety and stitching,"
953,FOURTH.,"And, goaded by the mad’ning titilation,"
954,FOURTH.,Mistook the itch for heav’nly inspiration:
955,FOURTH.,"And, being crazed, despite advancing age"
956,FOURTH.,Began her missionary pilgrimage.
957,FOURTH.,"She vow’d a vow, if folks would only ask her"
958,FOURTH.,She’d travel post from Maine to Madagascar
959,FOURTH.,"To make a single speech: Hence, small persuasion"
960,FOURTH.,Procured her services on this occasion.
961,FOURTH.,
962,FOURTH.,So when adorers all had screamed and shouted
963,FOURTH.,She op’d her mouth and feebly spouted
964,FOURTH.,"Chaotic mumblings of senility,"
965,FOURTH.,Sad proofs of nacent imbecility.
966,FOURTH.,It seemed she trusted thoughts would wax and strengthen
967,FOURTH.,"Unlike our forms, while ages grow and lengthen:"
968,FOURTH.,Or deemed a speech a kind of rubber fixture—
969,FOURTH.,"Perchance a marv’lous hom’opathic mixture,"
970,FOURTH.,"Whose pow’r, ’tis boasted by the science makers,"
971,FOURTH.,"Increases, spread o’er fifty thousand acres."
972,FOURTH.,She dismal talked of terrible “upheaving”
973,FOURTH.,"Of systems and peoples, quite past believing."
974,FOURTH.,"“Upheaved” the church, “upheaved” the contract civil;"
975,FOURTH.,"“Upheaved” poor man, but couldn’t eject the devil."
976,FOURTH.,"She catch-words droned—“oppressed,” “enslaved,” “humbled”"
977,FOURTH.,"“Downtrodden,” sound and sense together jumbled:"
978,FOURTH.,"As if, late motherhood developing"
979,FOURTH.,She soothed declining years enveloping
980,FOURTH.,The public doll in shreds and filaments
981,FOURTH.,Of Ethiop’s cast-off habiliments;
982,FOURTH.,"Or, if she’d stipulated in a barg’n"
983,FOURTH.,"To fulminate a giv’n amount of jarg’n,"
984,FOURTH.,And muttered tales designed for terse and witty
985,FOURTH.,Which ’stead of mirth excited only pity.
986,FOURTH.,A legend ster’otyped she droned and drivelled
987,FOURTH.,Of Brobdingnagian beldame lean and shrivelled
988,FOURTH.,"Who urged by passion wild, by love enraptured,"
989,FOURTH.,A Liliputian bridegroom sought and captured.
990,FOURTH.,"The groomsman too, it seems, was small and puny;"
991,FOURTH.,Likewise the priest quite “little for the money”
992,FOURTH.,Which granny good esteemed so queer and funny
993,FOURTH.,"It must induce a general conviction,"
994,FOURTH.,Unto the tall belongeth jurisdiction.
995,FOURTH.,"This really seemed, amid the wild confusion"
996,FOURTH.,"Of sense, the only possible conclusion."
997,FOURTH.,No other ornament adorned her tale—
998,FOURTH.,"To find a moral, even priests must fail."
999,FOURTH.,"Abundance more, as previously requested"
1000,FOURTH.,"The good dame spoke—no doubt her “level-best” did,—"
1001,FOURTH.,Then from her painful labor ceased and rested.
1002,FOURTH.,
1003,FOURTH.,"Of all this mighty concourse, hither borne"
1004,FOURTH.,"By various mood, just one came here to mourn."
1005,FOURTH.,"A bachelor, in attitude forlorn,"
1006,FOURTH.,"Who sadly grieved that ever he was born,"
1007,FOURTH.,"With features smileless, haggard, grim, and pale,"
1008,FOURTH.,Sat roosting on the semicircle’s rail
1009,FOURTH.,Which there enclosed the sacred altar in;
1010,FOURTH.,"His elbow on his knee, on hand his chin."
1011,FOURTH.,When now there came a lulling in the roar
1012,FOURTH.,And none at present occupied the floor
1013,FOURTH.,"He madly leaped to gain the speaker’s station,"
1014,FOURTH.,"In labor groaning with a young oration,"
1015,FOURTH.,And wildly screamed this famous declamation.
1016,FOURTH.,"“O woman, woman; foully fair,"
1017,FOURTH.,Thou source of bliss and yet despair—
1018,FOURTH.,"Thou pride of heav’n thou curse of hell,"
1019,FOURTH.,Thou greatest woe on earth that fell
1020,FOURTH.,When mad Pandora op’d her box
1021,FOURTH.,And horrors issued forth in flocks—
1022,FOURTH.,Thou richest gift vouchsafed to man
1023,FOURTH.,"When heav’n look’d down his wants to scan,—"
1024,FOURTH.,"Thou type of goodness, beauty, worth—"
1025,FOURTH.,The tie that links our hearts to earth
1026,FOURTH.,With silken cords we scarcely feel
1027,FOURTH.,Yet strong as pond’rous bars of steel—
1028,FOURTH.,"Thou ray of glory from on high,"
1029,FOURTH.,"Thou charmer, cheater, rib awry,"
1030,FOURTH.,How oft for you I’ve madly cried!
1031,FOURTH.,How oft become a tempocide!
1032,FOURTH.,"How often suffered, bled, and died!"
1033,FOURTH.,"Deceiver vile, yet fount of truth,"
1034,FOURTH.,"A Dian pure, a harlot Ruth,"
1035,FOURTH.,"O, why wast thou to mortals given?"
1036,FOURTH.,To tempt to hell—to lure to heav’n!”
1037,FOURTH.,"In agony he writhed at its conclusion,"
1038,FOURTH.,And swoon’d amid the general confusion.
1039,FOURTH.,
1040,FOURTH.,While red with flame the oven still was heated
1041,FOURTH.,"Like hapless Daniel’s seven times repeated,"
1042,FOURTH.,And self-elected cooks were fairly aching
1043,FOURTH.,"To have a finger in this public baking,"
1044,FOURTH.,"Some sharp director of the frothy brewing,"
1045,FOURTH.,"Intent on shrewdest ways and means pursuing,"
1046,FOURTH.,"Espied a form whose locks, uncombed and matted,"
1047,FOURTH.,"Betokened hasty rising,—or belated,—"
1048,FOURTH.,Involving toilet scanty and neglected:
1049,FOURTH.,"Or, more belike, he cunningly affected"
1050,FOURTH.,"Some studied roughness in the coat and trouser,"
1051,FOURTH.,To give “eclat” as leading “rabble rouser.”
1052,FOURTH.,Tho’ mingled with peculiarities
1053,FOURTH.,"His mind a storehouse was of rarities,"
1054,FOURTH.,"Wherein dame nature wrought in broadest plan,"
1055,FOURTH.,The full unstinted measure of a man.
1056,FOURTH.,Exuberant fancy pruned to limits fit
1057,FOURTH.,A yield profuse returned of golden wit;
1058,FOURTH.,"While wisdom, logic, sense, and virtue rung"
1059,FOURTH.,With eloquence spontaneous on his tongue.
1060,FOURTH.,"One, briefly, who the happy art possessed"
1061,FOURTH.,To _do_ the thing another just professed.
1062,FOURTH.,"Him they beset, with gen’ral acclamation,"
1063,FOURTH.,To “throw himself” for their regeneration.
1064,FOURTH.,"The time was trying, critical th’ occasion:"
1065,FOURTH.,"But finally he yielded to persuasion,"
1066,FOURTH.,"Tumbled his mane accordant with his custom,"
1067,FOURTH.,"And, while he wished their vanity would bust ’em,"
1068,FOURTH.,Talked gingerly as dubious to trust ’em.
1069,FOURTH.,"His speech, tho’ tough enough, and smooth and limber,"
1070,FOURTH.,"Had not that sturdy, manly, ringing “timbre,”"
1071,FOURTH.,"Which _carpenters of old_ from stock selected,"
1072,FOURTH.,When _massive_ structures were to be erected.
1073,FOURTH.,"He seemed gallant, who, minded to be civil,"
1074,FOURTH.,Reduced himself to childish woman’s level;
1075,FOURTH.,"And, so regarding their capacity,"
1076,FOURTH.,Talked little sense with much vivacity.
1077,FOURTH.,"As jugglers, when their trade they ply,"
1078,FOURTH.,"Of tinsel make display, to catch the eye,"
1079,FOURTH.,"And thus have “scope and verge” to cut their capers,"
1080,FOURTH.,Beneath the very nose of stupid gapers.
1081,FOURTH.,"He whiles like angry lion growled and grumbled,"
1082,FOURTH.,While mutterings like distant thunder rumbled.
1083,FOURTH.,"Anon, wit’s scintillations dazzled all,"
1084,FOURTH.,Like sunlight sparkling on a waterfall.
1085,FOURTH.,"With small regard for aught, for nothing stopping,"
1086,FOURTH.,Rising he thus broke out like champagne popping.
1087,FOURTH.,
1088,FOURTH.,Sing Io Bacche! Io Susan sing!
1089,FOURTH.,Shout hallelujah! let the welkin ring!
1090,FOURTH.,Let all the male creation bound and free
1091,FOURTH.,Hosannas raise in woman’s jubilee!
1092,FOURTH.,"The mighty tide is rolling, waves are dashing,"
1093,FOURTH.,"Oppressors tremble, kingly thrones are smashing;"
1094,FOURTH.,"Triumphant woman’s chariot wheels are flashing,"
1095,FOURTH.,And bigot’s bones like brittle glass are crashing
1096,FOURTH.,Beneath the blows of woman’s sabre slashing.
1097,FOURTH.,Great is Diana! marvellous her plan!
1098,FOURTH.,For her I feel as never yet for man.
1099,FOURTH.,I could for her my energies exhaust
1100,FOURTH.,And deem my ends attained at trifling cost.
1101,FOURTH.,The breeches fit us all ’tis plain to see:
1102,FOURTH.,"God bless the girls, they’re just the boys for me!"
1103,FOURTH.,*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *
1104,FOURTH.,"Should you decide in view of my devotion,"
1105,FOURTH.,"To use your quasi votes for my promotion,"
1106,FOURTH.,"Depend, such action promised and concluded"
1107,FOURTH.,Would prove the wisest thing that ever you did:
1108,FOURTH.,"For, “entre nous,” ’tis thought, my charming sisters,"
1109,FOURTH.,"Although you’re known of old as great persisters,"
1110,FOURTH.,"And, doubtless, versatile enough and tricky,"
1111,FOURTH.,"For easy roads—yet when the mud is sticky,"
1112,FOURTH.,"The wheeling rough, or up a heavy grade—"
1113,FOURTH.,"Perchance a weighty burden on you laid,"
1114,FOURTH.,"To carry which your backs were never made,"
1115,FOURTH.,Coarse muscle in the wheelers might avail
1116,FOURTH.,To move a load when lighter beasts must fail.
1117,FOURTH.,I say not this with view of underrating
1118,FOURTH.,"Your priceless value, nor _that_ price abating."
1119,FOURTH.,I merely would suggest a fair division
1120,FOURTH.,Of labor as perhaps a wise provision.
1121,FOURTH.,’Tis seen that dogs and other beastly samples
1122,FOURTH.,"Teach us to hunt in pairs, by their examples."
1123,FOURTH.,"Though women shirk the part of baby-feeders,"
1124,FOURTH.,They still might work in double-teams—as leaders.
1125,FOURTH.,"I recognize your fitness for the station,"
1126,FOURTH.,Bow to the law of nature’s ordination
1127,FOURTH.,"And raise my voice to swell the great ovation,"
1128,FOURTH.,That waits this movement’s culmination.
1129,FOURTH.,"Yet, humbly here would proffer a petition;"
1130,FOURTH.,"That, when her hopes are ripened to fruition,"
1131,FOURTH.,"And woman sits above us high and holy,"
1132,FOURTH.,"She’ll not forget to use us, (base and lowly"
1133,FOURTH.,"As we confess ourselves,) when powers brutal,"
1134,FOURTH.,"Like courage, strength, and zeal, may suit all"
1135,FOURTH.,The circumstances of the new connection
1136,FOURTH.,"’Twixt vulgar man and feminine perfection,"
1137,FOURTH.,"Permit us still, as an especial favor"
1138,FOURTH.,From ruder toils and war’s alarms to save her:
1139,FOURTH.,"The priv’lege grant, to fight, and toil, and swelter,"
1140,FOURTH.,"To furnish her support, and peace, and shelter;"
1141,FOURTH.,"To shield her angel face and fragile members,"
1142,FOURTH.,From summers burning and from chill Decembers.
1143,FOURTH.,"Yet, should such functions smack of arrogation"
1144,FOURTH.,We’ll service render in some humbler station.
1145,FOURTH.,"Perchance as barbers act, with greatest pleasure;"
1146,FOURTH.,"Or, kneeling low, as tailors, take her measure."
1147,FOURTH.,
1148,FOURTH.,When woman is enthroned and man deposed—
1149,FOURTH.,The masculine dynasty fairly closed—
1150,FOURTH.,All this would follow as a thing of course—
1151,FOURTH.,"As one ascends, the other sinks, perforce."
1152,FOURTH.,So much is plain to my poor comprehension;
1153,FOURTH.,"But pardon me when now I briefly mention,"
1154,FOURTH.,"Some quandaries which, spite of all my grinding"
1155,FOURTH.,Puzzle my brain past any hope of finding.
1156,FOURTH.,"If now, as Susan argues, (save the mark!)"
1157,FOURTH.,Fair woman should with man no more embark
1158,FOURTH.,"In trade or any other enterprize,"
1159,FOURTH.,"Calling, pursuit, or act beneath the skies,"
1160,FOURTH.,"Beseech you, lovely social reconstructors"
1161,FOURTH.,Who then shall play the role of reproductors?
1162,FOURTH.,"A man might dishes wash, might swing the ladle,"
1163,FOURTH.,"The dinner cook, and even rock the cradle—"
1164,FOURTH.,"But how to _fill_ the crib without a wife, or"
1165,FOURTH.,"A concubine, is more than I can cypher."
1166,FOURTH.,"Just here I find, like Butler to a pin,"
1167,FOURTH.,"Myself a bottle, closely stoppered in."
1168,FOURTH.,"And when the great millenium has met her,"
1169,FOURTH.,"When woman has no toil or care to fret her,"
1170,FOURTH.,Does she design to live and reign forever?
1171,FOURTH.,Hath fate no pow’r the thread of life to sever?
1172,FOURTH.,"Reckless, as to the conquered world’s possessors,"
1173,FOURTH.,Has she no thought or care for her successors?
1174,FOURTH.,And if maternal functions be discarded
1175,FOURTH.,How shall the future of the race be guarded?
1176,FOURTH.,I only ask for private information—
1177,FOURTH.,"No doubt there is a simple explanation,"
1178,FOURTH.,Which I would fain possess that I might offer
1179,FOURTH.,"The same to any godless gentile scoffer,"
1180,FOURTH.,"Who, sometimes might prefer unjust complaints,"
1181,FOURTH.,Or doubt the wisdom of the rule of saints.
1182,FOURTH.,"I fain would clothe myself in plated mail,"
1183,FOURTH.,"That, being safe, I need not shrink or quail"
1184,FOURTH.,"When far aloft I hear your blazoned banner,"
1185,FOURTH.,And battle—after politician’s manner.
1186,FOURTH.,If you will aid me by your ballots on
1187,FOURTH.,"My rough and rugged road to Washington,"
1188,FOURTH.,"Your modes of cure, and projects of prevention,"
1189,FOURTH.,"Shall, ladies, have—my earliest attention.”"
1190,FOURTH.,Thus he bewildered them in crafty ways;
1191,FOURTH.,And being flush of non-commital phrase
1192,FOURTH.,"Baptized their senses, sprinkling cloudy haze;"
1193,FOURTH.,Shouting reform by way of peroration
1194,FOURTH.,Till all were drunken wild with exultation.
1195,FOURTH.,That such delusive mixture pleased them well
1196,FOURTH.,"Attest unearthly shriek, hysteric yell,"
1197,FOURTH.,That deluge-like upon him ceasing fell.
1198,FOURTH.,’Twas like the chatterings and caws that rose
1199,FOURTH.,From o’er excited rookery of crows
1200,FOURTH.,When raven sermon rounded to its close.
1201,FOURTH.,"The spirit power conquered not a few,"
1202,FOURTH.,"Who, falling, shouted, “Hoop-te-doo-dle-doo.”"

1270,SUPPLEMENTARY CREATION. THE PALIMPSEST.,I’ll now unfold with sundry comments flavored.

1272,SUPPLEMENTARY CREATION. THE PALIMPSEST.,"When after lengthened ages of debating,"
1273,SUPPLEMENTARY CREATION. THE PALIMPSEST.,"And after all the heavn’ly host were tired of waiting,"
1274,SUPPLEMENTARY CREATION. THE PALIMPSEST.,"Th’ orig’nal plan was reached for man’s creating,"

1281,SUPPLEMENTARY CREATION. THE PALIMPSEST.,"Washing, sifting, like California miners,"
1282,SUPPLEMENTARY CREATION. THE PALIMPSEST.,In search of requisite amount of shiners.
