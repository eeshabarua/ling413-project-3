174,THE FROST SPIRIT,
175,THE FROST SPIRIT,"He comes,--he comes,--the Frost Spirit comes"
176,THE FROST SPIRIT,You may trace his footsteps now
177,THE FROST SPIRIT,On the naked woods and the blasted fields and the
178,THE FROST SPIRIT,brown hill's withered brow.
179,THE FROST SPIRIT,He has smitten the leaves of the gray old trees
180,THE FROST SPIRIT,"where their pleasant green came forth,"
181,THE FROST SPIRIT,"And the winds, which follow wherever he goes,"
182,THE FROST SPIRIT,have shaken them down to earth.
183,THE FROST SPIRIT,
184,THE FROST SPIRIT,"He comes,--he comes,--the Frost Spirit comes!"
185,THE FROST SPIRIT,"from the frozen Labrador,"
186,THE FROST SPIRIT,"From the icy bridge of the Northern seas, which"
187,THE FROST SPIRIT,"the white bear wanders o'er,"
188,THE FROST SPIRIT,"Where the fisherman's sail is stiff with ice, and the"
189,THE FROST SPIRIT,luckless forms below
190,THE FROST SPIRIT,In the sunless cold of the lingering night into
191,THE FROST SPIRIT,marble statues grow
192,THE FROST SPIRIT,
193,THE FROST SPIRIT,"He comes,--he comes,--the Frost Spirit comes"
194,THE FROST SPIRIT,"on the rushing Northern blast,"
195,THE FROST SPIRIT,And the dark Norwegian pines have bowed as his
196,THE FROST SPIRIT,fearful breath went past.
197,THE FROST SPIRIT,"With an unscorched wing he has hurried on,"
198,THE FROST SPIRIT,where the fires of Hecla glow
199,THE FROST SPIRIT,On the darkly beautiful sky above and the ancient
200,THE FROST SPIRIT,ice below.
201,THE FROST SPIRIT,
202,THE FROST SPIRIT,"He comes,--he comes,--the Frost Spirit comes"
203,THE FROST SPIRIT,and the quiet lake shall feel
204,THE FROST SPIRIT,"The torpid touch of his glazing breath, and ring to"
205,THE FROST SPIRIT,the skater's heel;
206,THE FROST SPIRIT,And the streams which danced on the broken
207,THE FROST SPIRIT,"rocks, or sang to the leaning grass,"
208,THE FROST SPIRIT,"Shall bow again to their winter chain, and in"
209,THE FROST SPIRIT,mournful silence pass.
210,THE FROST SPIRIT,"He comes,--he comes,--the Frost Spirit comes!"
211,THE FROST SPIRIT,"Let us meet him as we may,"
212,THE FROST SPIRIT,And turn with the light of the parlor-fire his evil
213,THE FROST SPIRIT,power away;
214,THE FROST SPIRIT,"And gather closer the circle round, when that"
215,THE FROST SPIRIT,"fire-light dances high,"
216,THE FROST SPIRIT,And laugh at the shriek of the baffled Fiend as
217,THE FROST SPIRIT,his sounding wing goes by!

224,THE MERRIMAC.,
225,THE MERRIMAC.,"""The Indians speak of a beautiful river, far to the south,"
226,THE MERRIMAC.,"which they call Merrimac.""--SIEUR. DE MONTS, 1604."
227,THE MERRIMAC.,
228,THE MERRIMAC.,
229,THE MERRIMAC.,Stream of my fathers! sweetly still
230,THE MERRIMAC.,The sunset rays thy valley fill;
231,THE MERRIMAC.,"Poured slantwise down the long defile,"
232,THE MERRIMAC.,"Wave, wood, and spire beneath them smile."
233,THE MERRIMAC.,I see the winding Powow fold
234,THE MERRIMAC.,"The green hill in its belt of gold,"
235,THE MERRIMAC.,"And following down its wavy line,"
236,THE MERRIMAC.,Its sparkling waters blend with thine.
237,THE MERRIMAC.,"There's not a tree upon thy side,"
238,THE MERRIMAC.,"Nor rock, which thy returning tide"
239,THE MERRIMAC.,As yet hath left abrupt and stark
240,THE MERRIMAC.,Above thy evening water-mark;
241,THE MERRIMAC.,"No calm cove with its rocky hem,"
242,THE MERRIMAC.,No isle whose emerald swells begin
243,THE MERRIMAC.,"Thy broad, smooth current; not a sail"
244,THE MERRIMAC.,Bowed to the freshening ocean gale;
245,THE MERRIMAC.,"No small boat with its busy oars,"
246,THE MERRIMAC.,Nor gray wall sloping to thy shores;
247,THE MERRIMAC.,"Nor farm-house with its maple shade,"
248,THE MERRIMAC.,"Or rigid poplar colonnade,"
249,THE MERRIMAC.,"But lies distinct and full in sight,"
250,THE MERRIMAC.,Beneath this gush of sunset light.
251,THE MERRIMAC.,"Centuries ago, that harbor-bar,"
252,THE MERRIMAC.,"Stretching its length of foam afar,"
253,THE MERRIMAC.,"And Salisbury's beach of shining sand,"
254,THE MERRIMAC.,"And yonder island's wave-smoothed strand,"
255,THE MERRIMAC.,"Saw the adventurer's tiny sail,"
256,THE MERRIMAC.,"Flit, stooping from the eastern gale;"
257,THE MERRIMAC.,And o'er these woods and waters broke
258,THE MERRIMAC.,"The cheer from Britain's hearts of oak,"
259,THE MERRIMAC.,"As brightly on the voyager's eye,"
260,THE MERRIMAC.,"Weary of forest, sea, and sky,"
261,THE MERRIMAC.,"Breaking the dull continuous wood,"
262,THE MERRIMAC.,The Merrimac rolled down his flood;
263,THE MERRIMAC.,"Mingling that clear pellucid brook,"
264,THE MERRIMAC.,Which channels vast Agioochook
265,THE MERRIMAC.,When spring-time's sun and shower unlock
266,THE MERRIMAC.,"The frozen fountains of the rock,"
267,THE MERRIMAC.,And more abundant waters given
268,THE MERRIMAC.,"From that pure lake, ""The Smile of Heaven,"""
269,THE MERRIMAC.,"Tributes from vale and mountain-side,--"
270,THE MERRIMAC.,"With ocean's dark, eternal tide!"
271,THE MERRIMAC.,
272,THE MERRIMAC.,"On yonder rocky cape, which braves"
273,THE MERRIMAC.,"The stormy challenge of the waves,"
274,THE MERRIMAC.,"Midst tangled vine and dwarfish wood,"
275,THE MERRIMAC.,"The hardy Anglo-Saxon stood,"
276,THE MERRIMAC.,Planting upon the topmost crag
277,THE MERRIMAC.,The staff of England's battle-flag;
278,THE MERRIMAC.,"And, while from out its heavy fold"
279,THE MERRIMAC.,"Saint George's crimson cross unrolled,"
280,THE MERRIMAC.,"Midst roll of drum and trumpet blare,"
281,THE MERRIMAC.,"And weapons brandishing in air,"
282,THE MERRIMAC.,He gave to that lone promontory
283,THE MERRIMAC.,The sweetest name in all his story;
284,THE MERRIMAC.,"Of her, the flower of Islam's daughters,"
285,THE MERRIMAC.,"Whose harems look on Stamboul's waters,--"
286,THE MERRIMAC.,"Who, when the chance of war had bound"
287,THE MERRIMAC.,"The Moslem chain his limbs around,"
288,THE MERRIMAC.,"Wreathed o'er with silk that iron chain,"
289,THE MERRIMAC.,"Soothed with her smiles his hours of pain,"
290,THE MERRIMAC.,And fondly to her youthful slave
291,THE MERRIMAC.,A dearer gift than freedom gave.
292,THE MERRIMAC.,
293,THE MERRIMAC.,But look! the yellow light no more
294,THE MERRIMAC.,Streams down on wave and verdant shore;
295,THE MERRIMAC.,And clearly on the calm air swells
296,THE MERRIMAC.,The twilight voice of distant bells.
297,THE MERRIMAC.,"From Ocean's bosom, white and thin,"
298,THE MERRIMAC.,The mists come slowly rolling in;
299,THE MERRIMAC.,"Hills, woods, the river's rocky rim,"
300,THE MERRIMAC.,"Amidst the sea--like vapor swim,"
301,THE MERRIMAC.,"While yonder lonely coast-light, set"
302,THE MERRIMAC.,"Within its wave-washed minaret,"
303,THE MERRIMAC.,"Half quenched, a beamless star and pale,"
304,THE MERRIMAC.,Shines dimly through its cloudy veil!
305,THE MERRIMAC.,
306,THE MERRIMAC.,Home of my fathers!--I have stood
307,THE MERRIMAC.,Where Hudson rolled his lordly flood
308,THE MERRIMAC.,Seen sunrise rest and sunset fade
309,THE MERRIMAC.,Along his frowning Palisade;
310,THE MERRIMAC.,Looked down the Appalachian peak
311,THE MERRIMAC.,On Juniata's silver streak;
312,THE MERRIMAC.,Have seen along his valley gleam
313,THE MERRIMAC.,The Mohawk's softly winding stream;
314,THE MERRIMAC.,The level light of sunset shine
315,THE MERRIMAC.,Through broad Potomac's hem of pine;
316,THE MERRIMAC.,And autumn's rainbow-tinted banner
317,THE MERRIMAC.,Hang lightly o'er the Susquehanna;
318,THE MERRIMAC.,"Yet wheresoe'er his step might be,"
319,THE MERRIMAC.,Thy wandering child looked back to thee!
320,THE MERRIMAC.,Heard in his dreams thy river's sound
321,THE MERRIMAC.,"Of murmuring on its pebbly bound,"
322,THE MERRIMAC.,The unforgotten swell and roar
323,THE MERRIMAC.,Of waves on thy familiar shore;
324,THE MERRIMAC.,"And saw, amidst the curtained gloom"
325,THE MERRIMAC.,"And quiet of his lonely room,"
326,THE MERRIMAC.,Thy sunset scenes before him pass;
327,THE MERRIMAC.,"As, in Agrippa's magic glass,"
328,THE MERRIMAC.,"The loved and lost arose to view,"
329,THE MERRIMAC.,"Remembered groves in greenness grew,"
330,THE MERRIMAC.,"Bathed still in childhood's morning dew,"
331,THE MERRIMAC.,Along whose bowers of beauty swept
332,THE MERRIMAC.,"Whatever Memory's mourners wept,"
333,THE MERRIMAC.,"Sweet faces, which the charnel kept,"
334,THE MERRIMAC.,"Young, gentle eyes, which long had slept;"
335,THE MERRIMAC.,"And while the gazer leaned to trace,"
336,THE MERRIMAC.,"More near, some dear familiar face,"
337,THE MERRIMAC.,"He wept to find the vision flown,--"
338,THE MERRIMAC.,A phantom and a dream alone!

346,HAMPTON BEACH,
347,HAMPTON BEACH,"The sunlight glitters keen and bright,"
348,HAMPTON BEACH,"Where, miles away,"
349,HAMPTON BEACH,Lies stretching to my dazzled sight
350,HAMPTON BEACH,"A luminous belt, a misty light,"
351,HAMPTON BEACH,Beyond the dark pine bluffs and wastes of sandy gray.
352,HAMPTON BEACH,
353,HAMPTON BEACH,The tremulous shadow of the Sea!
354,HAMPTON BEACH,Against its ground
355,HAMPTON BEACH,"Of silvery light, rock, hill, and tree,"
356,HAMPTON BEACH,"Still as a picture, clear and free,"
357,HAMPTON BEACH,With varying outline mark the coast for miles around.
358,HAMPTON BEACH,
359,HAMPTON BEACH,On--on--we tread with loose-flung rein
360,HAMPTON BEACH,"Our seaward way,"
361,HAMPTON BEACH,"Through dark-green fields and blossoming grain,"
362,HAMPTON BEACH,"Where the wild brier-rose skirts the lane,"
363,HAMPTON BEACH,And bends above our heads the flowering locust spray.
364,HAMPTON BEACH,
365,HAMPTON BEACH,Ha! like a kind hand on my brow
366,HAMPTON BEACH,"Comes this fresh breeze,"
367,HAMPTON BEACH,"Cooling its dull and feverish glow,"
368,HAMPTON BEACH,While through my being seems to flow
369,HAMPTON BEACH,"The breath of a new life, the healing of the seas!"
370,HAMPTON BEACH,
371,HAMPTON BEACH,"Now rest we, where this grassy mound"
372,HAMPTON BEACH,His feet hath set
373,HAMPTON BEACH,"In the great waters, which have bound"
374,HAMPTON BEACH,His granite ankles greenly round
375,HAMPTON BEACH,"With long and tangled moss, and weeds with cool spray wet."
376,HAMPTON BEACH,
377,HAMPTON BEACH,Good-by to Pain and Care! I take
378,HAMPTON BEACH,Mine ease to-day
379,HAMPTON BEACH,"Here where these sunny waters break,"
380,HAMPTON BEACH,"And ripples this keen breeze, I shake"
381,HAMPTON BEACH,"All burdens from the heart, all weary thoughts away."
382,HAMPTON BEACH,
383,HAMPTON BEACH,"I draw a freer breath, I seem"
384,HAMPTON BEACH,Like all I see--
385,HAMPTON BEACH,"Waves in the sun, the white-winged gleam"
386,HAMPTON BEACH,"Of sea-birds in the slanting beam,"
387,HAMPTON BEACH,And far-off sails which flit before the south-wind free.
388,HAMPTON BEACH,
389,HAMPTON BEACH,"So when Time's veil shall fall asunder,"
390,HAMPTON BEACH,The soul may know
391,HAMPTON BEACH,"No fearful change, nor sudden wonder,"
392,HAMPTON BEACH,"Nor sink the weight of mystery under,"
393,HAMPTON BEACH,"But with the upward rise, and with the vastness grow."
394,HAMPTON BEACH,
395,HAMPTON BEACH,And all we shrink from now may seem
396,HAMPTON BEACH,No new revealing;
397,HAMPTON BEACH,"Familiar as our childhood's stream,"
398,HAMPTON BEACH,Or pleasant memory of a dream
399,HAMPTON BEACH,The loved and cherished Past upon the new life stealing.
400,HAMPTON BEACH,
401,HAMPTON BEACH,Serene and mild the untried light
402,HAMPTON BEACH,May have its dawning;
403,HAMPTON BEACH,"And, as in summer's northern night"
404,HAMPTON BEACH,"The evening and the dawn unite,"
405,HAMPTON BEACH,The sunset hues of Time blend with the soul's new morning.
406,HAMPTON BEACH,
407,HAMPTON BEACH,I sit alone; in foam and spray
408,HAMPTON BEACH,Wave after wave
409,HAMPTON BEACH,"Breaks on the rocks which, stern and gray,"
410,HAMPTON BEACH,"Shoulder the broken tide away,"
411,HAMPTON BEACH,Or murmurs hoarse and strong through mossy cleft and cave.
412,HAMPTON BEACH,
413,HAMPTON BEACH,What heed I of the dusty land
414,HAMPTON BEACH,And noisy town?
415,HAMPTON BEACH,I see the mighty deep expand
416,HAMPTON BEACH,From its white line of glimmering sand
417,HAMPTON BEACH,To where the blue of heaven on bluer waves shuts down!
418,HAMPTON BEACH,
419,HAMPTON BEACH,"In listless quietude of mind,"
420,HAMPTON BEACH,I yield to all
421,HAMPTON BEACH,The change of cloud and wave and wind
422,HAMPTON BEACH,"And passive on the flood reclined,"
423,HAMPTON BEACH,"I wander with the waves, and with them rise and fall."
424,HAMPTON BEACH,
425,HAMPTON BEACH,"But look, thou dreamer! wave and shore"
426,HAMPTON BEACH,In shadow lie;
427,HAMPTON BEACH,The night-wind warns me back once more
428,HAMPTON BEACH,"To where, my native hill-tops o'er,"
429,HAMPTON BEACH,Bends like an arch of fire the glowing sunset sky.
430,HAMPTON BEACH,
431,HAMPTON BEACH,"So then, beach, bluff, and wave, farewell!"
432,HAMPTON BEACH,I bear with me
433,HAMPTON BEACH,"No token stone nor glittering shell,"
434,HAMPTON BEACH,But long and oft shall Memory tell
435,HAMPTON BEACH,Of this brief thoughtful hour of musing by the Sea.

443,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,
444,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,Bland as the morning breath of June

446,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,"And, through its haze, the winter noon"

452,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,
453,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,"The fox his hillside cell forsakes,"
454,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,"The muskrat leaves his nook,"
455,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,The bluebird in the meadow brakes
456,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,Is singing with the brook.
457,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,"""Bear up, O Mother Nature!"" cry"

461,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,
462,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,"So, in those winters of the soul,"
463,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,By bitter blasts and drear
464,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,"O'erswept from Memory's frozen pole,"
465,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,Will sunny days appear.
466,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,"Reviving Hope and Faith, they show"
467,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,"The soul its living powers,"
468,A DREAM OF SUMMER.,And how beneath the winter's snow

2126,A MYSTERY.,
2127,A MYSTERY.,
2128,A SEA DREAM.,A SEA DREAM.
2129,A SEA DREAM.,
2130,A SEA DREAM.,"We saw the slow tides go and come,"
2131,A SEA DREAM.,"The curving surf-lines lightly drawn,"
2132,A SEA DREAM.,The gray rocks touched with tender bloom
2133,A SEA DREAM.,Beneath the fresh-blown rose of dawn.
2134,A SEA DREAM.,
2135,A SEA DREAM.,We saw in richer sunsets lost
2136,A SEA DREAM.,The sombre pomp of showery noons;
2137,A SEA DREAM.,And signalled spectral sails that crossed
2138,A SEA DREAM.,"The weird, low light of rising moons."
2139,A SEA DREAM.,
2140,A SEA DREAM.,On stormy eves from cliff and head
2141,A SEA DREAM.,We saw the white spray tossed and spurned;
2142,A SEA DREAM.,"While over all, in gold and red,"
2143,A SEA DREAM.,Its face of fire the lighthouse turned.
2144,A SEA DREAM.,
2145,A SEA DREAM.,"The rail-car brought its daily crowds,"
2146,A SEA DREAM.,"Half curious, half indifferent,"
2147,A SEA DREAM.,"Like passing sails or floating clouds,"
2148,A SEA DREAM.,We saw them as they came and went.
2149,A SEA DREAM.,
2150,A SEA DREAM.,"But, one calm morning, as we lay"
2151,A SEA DREAM.,And watched the mirage-lifted wall
2152,A SEA DREAM.,"Of coast, across the dreamy bay,"
2153,A SEA DREAM.,"And heard afar the curlew call,"
2154,A SEA DREAM.,
2155,A SEA DREAM.,"And nearer voices, wild or tame,"
2156,A SEA DREAM.,"Of airy flock and childish throng,"
2157,A SEA DREAM.,Up from the water's edge there came
2158,A SEA DREAM.,Faint snatches of familiar song.
2159,A SEA DREAM.,
2160,A SEA DREAM.,Careless we heard the singer's choice
2161,A SEA DREAM.,Of old and common airs; at last
2162,A SEA DREAM.,The tender pathos of his voice
2163,A SEA DREAM.,In one low chanson held us fast.
2164,A SEA DREAM.,
2165,A SEA DREAM.,"A song that mingled joy and pain,"
2166,A SEA DREAM.,And memories old and sadly sweet;
2167,A SEA DREAM.,"While, timing to its minor strain,"
2168,A SEA DREAM.,The waves in lapsing cadence beat.
2169,A SEA DREAM.,
2170,A SEA DREAM.,.     .     .     .     .
2171,A SEA DREAM.,
2172,A SEA DREAM.,The waves are glad in breeze and sun;
2173,A SEA DREAM.,The rocks are fringed with foam;
2174,A SEA DREAM.,"I walk once more a haunted shore,"
2175,A SEA DREAM.,"A stranger, yet at home,"
2176,A SEA DREAM.,A land of dreams I roam.
2177,A SEA DREAM.,
2178,A SEA DREAM.,"Is this the wind, the soft sea wind"
2179,A SEA DREAM.,That stirred thy locks of brown?
2180,A SEA DREAM.,Are these the rocks whose mosses knew
2181,A SEA DREAM.,"The trail of thy light gown,"
2182,A SEA DREAM.,Where boy and girl sat down?
2183,A SEA DREAM.,
2184,A SEA DREAM.,"I see the gray fort's broken wall,"
2185,A SEA DREAM.,The boats that rock below;
2186,A SEA DREAM.,"And, out at sea, the passing sails"
2187,A SEA DREAM.,We saw so long ago
2188,A SEA DREAM.,Rose-red in morning's glow.
2189,A SEA DREAM.,
2190,A SEA DREAM.,The freshness of the early time
2191,A SEA DREAM.,On every breeze is blown;
2192,A SEA DREAM.,"As glad the sea, as blue the sky,--"
2193,A SEA DREAM.,The change is ours alone;
2194,A SEA DREAM.,The saddest is my own.
2195,A SEA DREAM.,
2196,A SEA DREAM.,"A stranger now, a world-worn man,"
2197,A SEA DREAM.,Is he who bears my name;
2198,A SEA DREAM.,"But thou, methinks, whose mortal life"
2199,A SEA DREAM.,"Immortal youth became,"
2200,A SEA DREAM.,Art evermore the same.
2201,A SEA DREAM.,
2202,A SEA DREAM.,"Thou art not here, thou art not there,"
2203,A SEA DREAM.,Thy place I cannot see;
2204,A SEA DREAM.,I only know that where thou art
2205,A SEA DREAM.,"The blessed angels be,"
2206,A SEA DREAM.,And heaven is glad for thee.
2207,A SEA DREAM.,
2208,A SEA DREAM.,Forgive me if the evil years
2209,A SEA DREAM.,Have left on me their sign;
2210,A SEA DREAM.,"Wash out, O soul so beautiful,"
2211,A SEA DREAM.,The many stains of mine
2212,A SEA DREAM.,In tears of love divine!
2213,A SEA DREAM.,
2214,A SEA DREAM.,"I could not look on thee and live,"
2215,A SEA DREAM.,If thou wert by my side;
2216,A SEA DREAM.,"The vision of a shining one,"
2217,A SEA DREAM.,"The white and heavenly bride,"
2218,A SEA DREAM.,Is well to me denied.
2219,A SEA DREAM.,
2220,A SEA DREAM.,But turn to me thy dear girl-face
2221,A SEA DREAM.,"Without the angel's crown,"
2222,A SEA DREAM.,"The wedded roses of thy lips,"
2223,A SEA DREAM.,Thy loose hair rippling down
2224,A SEA DREAM.,In waves of golden brown.
2225,A SEA DREAM.,
2226,A SEA DREAM.,"Look forth once more through space and time,"
2227,A SEA DREAM.,And let thy sweet shade fall
2228,A SEA DREAM.,In tenderest grace of soul and form
2229,A SEA DREAM.,"On memory's frescoed wall,"
2230,A SEA DREAM.,"A shadow, and yet all!"
2231,A SEA DREAM.,
2232,A SEA DREAM.,"Draw near, more near, forever dear!"
2233,A SEA DREAM.,"Where'er I rest or roam,"
2234,A SEA DREAM.,"Or in the city's crowded streets,"
2235,A SEA DREAM.,"Or by the blown sea foam,"
2236,A SEA DREAM.,The thought of thee is home!
2237,A SEA DREAM.,
2238,A SEA DREAM.,.     .     .    .    .
2239,A SEA DREAM.,
2240,A SEA DREAM.,At breakfast hour the singer read
2241,A SEA DREAM.,"The city news, with comment wise,"
2242,A SEA DREAM.,Like one who felt the pulse of trade
2243,A SEA DREAM.,Beneath his finger fall and rise.
2244,A SEA DREAM.,
2245,A SEA DREAM.,"His look, his air, his curt speech, told"
2246,A SEA DREAM.,"The man of action, not of books,"
2247,A SEA DREAM.,To whom the corners made in gold
2248,A SEA DREAM.,And stocks were more than seaside nooks.
2249,A SEA DREAM.,
2250,A SEA DREAM.,Of life beneath the life confessed
2251,A SEA DREAM.,His song had hinted unawares;
2252,A SEA DREAM.,"Of flowers in traffic's ledgers pressed,"
2253,A SEA DREAM.,Of human hearts in bulls and bears.
2254,A SEA DREAM.,
2255,A SEA DREAM.,But eyes in vain were turned to watch
2256,A SEA DREAM.,That face so hard and shrewd and strong;
2257,A SEA DREAM.,And ears in vain grew sharp to catch
2258,A SEA DREAM.,The meaning of that morning song.
2259,A SEA DREAM.,
2260,A SEA DREAM.,In vain some sweet-voiced querist sought
2261,A SEA DREAM.,"To sound him, leaving as she came;"
2262,A SEA DREAM.,Her baited album only caught
2263,A SEA DREAM.,"A common, unromantic name."
2264,A SEA DREAM.,
2265,A SEA DREAM.,"No word betrayed the mystery fine,"
2266,A SEA DREAM.,That trembled on the singer's tongue;
2267,A SEA DREAM.,"He came and went, and left no sign"
2268,A SEA DREAM.,Behind him save the song he sung.

2299,HAZEL BLOSSOMS.,Its glad surprisals never fail.

2301,HAZEL BLOSSOMS.,O days grown cold! O life grown old

2313,HAZEL BLOSSOMS.,"So, in the wise Diviner's hand,"

2315,HAZEL BLOSSOMS.,"To feel, beneath a thirsty land,"

2317,HAZEL BLOSSOMS.,The beating of the rivulet's heart!
2318,HAZEL BLOSSOMS.,
2319,HAZEL BLOSSOMS.,Sufficeth me the gift to light

3870,MY NAMESAKE.,
3871,MY NAMESAKE.,"""On all his sad or restless moods"

3881,MY NAMESAKE.,"""The simple tastes, the kindly traits,"

3889,MY NAMESAKE.,He tossed on satire's horn.
3890,MY NAMESAKE.,
3891,MY NAMESAKE.,"""But still his heart was full of awe"

3895,MY NAMESAKE.,
3896,MY NAMESAKE.,"""Life's mystery wrapt him like a cloud;"
3897,MY NAMESAKE.,"He heard far voices mock his own,"

3899,MY NAMESAKE.,Long roll of waves unknown.
3900,MY NAMESAKE.,
3901,MY NAMESAKE.,"""The arrows of his straining sight"
3902,MY NAMESAKE.,"Fell quenched in darkness; priest and sage,"
3903,MY NAMESAKE.,"Like lost guides calling left and right,"
3904,MY NAMESAKE.,Perplexed his doubtful age.
3905,MY NAMESAKE.,
3906,MY NAMESAKE.,"""Like childhood, listening for the sound"
3907,MY NAMESAKE.,"Of its dropped pebbles in the well,"
3908,MY NAMESAKE.,All vainly down the dark profound
3909,MY NAMESAKE.,His brief-lined plummet fell.
3910,MY NAMESAKE.,
3911,MY NAMESAKE.,"""So, scattering flowers with pious pains"
3912,MY NAMESAKE.,"On old beliefs, of later creeds,"
3913,MY NAMESAKE.,"Which claimed a place in Truth's domains,"
3914,MY NAMESAKE.,He asked the title-deeds.
3915,MY NAMESAKE.,
3916,MY NAMESAKE.,"""He saw the old-time's groves and shrines"
3917,MY NAMESAKE.,In the long distance fair and dim;
3918,MY NAMESAKE.,"And heard, like sound of far-off pines,"
3919,MY NAMESAKE.,The century-mellowed hymn!
3920,MY NAMESAKE.,
3921,MY NAMESAKE.,"""He dared not mock the Dervish whirl,"
3922,MY NAMESAKE.,"The Brahmin's rite, the Lama's spell;"
3923,MY NAMESAKE.,God knew the heart; Devotion's pearl
3924,MY NAMESAKE.,Might sanctify the shell.
3925,MY NAMESAKE.,
3926,MY NAMESAKE.,"""While others trod the altar stairs"
3927,MY NAMESAKE.,He faltered like the publican;
3928,MY NAMESAKE.,"And, while they praised as saints, his prayers"
3929,MY NAMESAKE.,Were those of sinful man.
3930,MY NAMESAKE.,
3931,MY NAMESAKE.,"""For, awed by Sinai's Mount of Law,"
3932,MY NAMESAKE.,"The trembling faith alone sufficed,"
3933,MY NAMESAKE.,"That, through its cloud and flame, he saw"
3934,MY NAMESAKE.,"The sweet, sad face of Christ!"
3935,MY NAMESAKE.,
3936,MY NAMESAKE.,"""And listening, with his forehead bowed,"
3937,MY NAMESAKE.,Heard the Divine compassion fill

3940,MY NAMESAKE.,
3941,MY NAMESAKE.,"""The words he spake, the thoughts he penned,"

4049,MY DREAM.,
4050,MY DREAM.,"Steeper, darker!--lo! I felt"
4051,MY DREAM.,From my feet the pathway melt.
4052,MY DREAM.,"Swallowed by the black despair,"
4053,MY DREAM.,"And the hungry jaws of air,"
4054,MY DREAM.,
4055,MY DREAM.,"Past the stony-throated caves,"
4056,MY DREAM.,"Strangled by the wash of waves,"
4057,MY DREAM.,"Past the splintered crags, I sank"
4058,MY DREAM.,"On a green and flowery bank,--"
4059,MY DREAM.,
4060,MY DREAM.,"Soft as fall of thistle-down,"
4061,MY DREAM.,"Lightly as a cloud is blown,"
4062,MY DREAM.,Soothingly as childhood pressed
4063,MY DREAM.,To the bosom of its rest.
4064,MY DREAM.,
4065,MY DREAM.,"Of the sharp-horned rocks instead,"

4068,MY DREAM.,Trees that propped a golden sky.
4069,MY DREAM.,
4070,MY DREAM.,"Painless, trustful, sorrow-free,"
4071,MY DREAM.,"Old lost faces welcomed me,"
4072,MY DREAM.,With whose sweetness of content
4073,MY DREAM.,Still expectant hope was blent.
4074,MY DREAM.,
4075,MY DREAM.,Waking while the dawning gray
4076,MY DREAM.,"Slowly brightened into day,"
4077,MY DREAM.,"Pondering that vision fled,"
4078,MY DREAM.,Thus unto myself I said:--
4079,MY DREAM.,
4080,MY DREAM.,"""Steep and hung with clouds of strife"

4085,MY DREAM.,"""So, with painful steps we climb"

4088,MY DREAM.,By the forecast of our dread.
4089,MY DREAM.,
4090,MY DREAM.,"""Dread of mystery solved alone,"

4095,MY DREAM.,"""And this heart-consuming care,"

4098,MY DREAM.,"Prove but simple lack of faith."""
4099,MY DREAM.,
4100,MY DREAM.,"Thou, O Most Compassionate!"
4101,MY DREAM.,"Who didst stoop to our estate,"

4104,MY DREAM.,
4105,MY DREAM.,"Through the doubt and mystery,"
4106,MY DREAM.,"Grant to us thy steps to see,"
4107,MY DREAM.,And the grace to draw from thence
4108,MY DREAM.,Larger hope and confidence.
4109,MY DREAM.,
4110,MY DREAM.,"Show thy vacant tomb, and let,"

4276,MY PSALM.,
4277,MY PSALM.,Not less shall manly deed and word
4278,MY PSALM.,Rebuke an age of wrong;
4279,MY PSALM.,The graven flowers that wreathe the sword
4280,MY PSALM.,Make not the blade less strong.
4281,MY PSALM.,
4282,MY PSALM.,"But smiting hands shall learn to heal,--"

4388,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"in school-house prayer-meetings and dance in a Washington ball-room,"
4389,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,while her father was a member of Congress. She early embraced the
4390,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"doctrine of the Second Advent, and felt it her duty to proclaim the"

4392,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,spent the greater part of a long life in travelling over Europe and
4393,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Asia. She lived some time with Lady Hester Stanhope, a woman as"
4394,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"fantastic and mentally strained as herself, on the slope of Mt. Lebanon,"
4395,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,but finally quarrelled with her in regard to two white horses with red
4396,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"marks on their backs which suggested the idea of saddles, on which her"
4397,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,titled hostess expected to ride into Jerusalem with the Lord. A friend

4411,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"fishing and, it must be confessed, with stories which he at least half"
4412,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"believed, of witchcraft and apparitions. My mother, who was born in the"
4413,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Indian-haunted region of Somersworth, New Hampshire, between Dover and"
4414,THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.,"Portsmouth, told us of the inroads of the savages, and the narrow escape"

6527,PALESTINE,Made bright by the steps of the angels of God.
6528,PALESTINE,
6529,PALESTINE,Blue sea of the hills! in my spirit I hear
6530,PALESTINE,"Thy waters, Gennesaret, chime on my ear;"
6531,PALESTINE,"Where the Lowly and Just with the people sat down,"
6532,PALESTINE,And thy spray on the dust of His sandals was thrown.
6533,PALESTINE,
6534,PALESTINE,"Beyond are Bethulia's mountains of green,"
6535,PALESTINE,And the desolate hills of the wild Gadarene;
6536,PALESTINE,And I pause on the goat-crags of Tabor to see
6537,PALESTINE,"The gleam of thy waters, O dark Galilee!"
6538,PALESTINE,
6539,PALESTINE,"Hark, a sound in the valley! where, swollen and strong,"
6540,PALESTINE,"Thy river, O Kishon, is sweeping along;"
6541,PALESTINE,"Where the Canaanite strove with Jehovah in vain,"
6542,PALESTINE,And thy torrent grew dark with the blood of the slain.

6550,PALESTINE,"To the song which the beautiful prophetess sang,"
6551,PALESTINE,"When the princes of Issachar stood by her side,"
6552,PALESTINE,And the shout of a host in its triumph replied.
6553,PALESTINE,
6554,PALESTINE,"Lo, Bethlehem's hill-site before me is seen,"
6555,PALESTINE,"With the mountains around, and the valleys between;"
6556,PALESTINE,"There rested the shepherds of Judah, and there"
6557,PALESTINE,The song of the angels rose sweet on the air.
6558,PALESTINE,
6559,PALESTINE,And Bethany's palm-trees in beauty still throw
6560,PALESTINE,Their shadows at noon on the ruins below;
6561,PALESTINE,But where are the sisters who hastened to greet
6562,PALESTINE,"The lowly Redeemer, and sit at His feet?"
6563,PALESTINE,
6564,PALESTINE,I tread where the twelve in their wayfaring trod;
6565,PALESTINE,I stand where they stood with the chosen of God--
6566,PALESTINE,"Where His blessing was heard and His lessons were taught,"
6567,PALESTINE,Where the blind were restored and the healing was wrought.
6568,PALESTINE,
6569,PALESTINE,"Oh, here with His flock the sad Wanderer came;"
6570,PALESTINE,These hills He toiled over in grief are the same;
6571,PALESTINE,"The founts where He drank by the wayside still flow,"
6572,PALESTINE,And the same airs are blowing which breathed on His brow!
6573,PALESTINE,
6574,PALESTINE,"And throned on her hills sits Jerusalem yet,"
6575,PALESTINE,"But with dust on her forehead, and chains on her feet;"
6576,PALESTINE,"For the crown of her pride to the mocker hath gone,"
6577,PALESTINE,And the holy Shechinah is dark where it shone.
6578,PALESTINE,
6579,PALESTINE,But wherefore this dream of the earthly abode
6580,PALESTINE,Of Humanity clothed in the brightness of God?
6581,PALESTINE,"Were my spirit but turned from the outward and dim,"

6586,PALESTINE,And the voice which breathed peace to the waves of the sea
6587,PALESTINE,In the hush of my spirit would whisper to me!
6588,PALESTINE,
6589,PALESTINE,"And what if my feet may not tread where He stood,"
6590,PALESTINE,"Nor my ears hear the dashing of Galilee's flood,"
6591,PALESTINE,"Nor my eyes see the cross which he bowed Him to bear,"
6592,PALESTINE,Nor my knees press Gethsemane's garden of prayer.
6593,PALESTINE,
6594,PALESTINE,"Yet, Loved of the Father, Thy Spirit is near"
6595,PALESTINE,"To the meek, and the lowly, and penitent here;"
6596,PALESTINE,And the voice of Thy love is the same even now
6597,PALESTINE,As at Bethany's tomb or on Olivet's brow.
6598,PALESTINE,
6599,PALESTINE,"Oh, the outward hath gone! but in glory and power."
6600,PALESTINE,The spirit surviveth the things of an hour;
6601,PALESTINE,"Unchanged, undecaying, its Pentecost flame"

9341,THE MEETING.,spirituality impressed all who knew her. In obedience to her apprehended
9342,THE MEETING.,"duty she made visits of Christian love to various parts of Europe, and"
9343,THE MEETING.,to the West Coast of Africa and Palestine.

9345,THE MEETING.,
9346,THE MEETING.,"The elder folks shook hands at last,"

9349,THE MEETING.,"Half solemnized and half amused,"
9350,THE MEETING.,"With long-drawn breath and shrug, my guest"

9352,THE MEETING.,"Outside, the hills lay warm in sun;"
9353,THE MEETING.,The cattle in the meadow-run

9355,THE MEETING.,The green repose above us stirred.
9356,THE MEETING.,"""What part or lot have you,"" he said,"

9422,THE MEETING.,"And, making earth too great for heaven,"

9424,THE MEETING.,
9425,THE MEETING.,"""And so, I find it well to come"
9426,THE MEETING.,"For deeper rest to this still room,"

9428,THE MEETING.,Feels less the outer world's control;
9429,THE MEETING.,The strength of mutual purpose pleads
9430,THE MEETING.,More earnestly our common needs;
9431,THE MEETING.,And from the silence multiplied
9432,THE MEETING.,"By these still forms on either side,"

9929,THE PRAYER OF AGASSIZ.,The island of Penikese in Buzzard's Bay was given by Mr. John Anderson
9930,THE PRAYER OF AGASSIZ.,to Agassiz for the uses of a summer school of natural history. A large

9937,THE PRAYER OF AGASSIZ.,"as natural as it was unpremeditated, he called upon then to join in"
