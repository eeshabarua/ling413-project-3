21,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,The Standard Library Edition of Mr. Whittier's  writings comprises his
22,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,poetical and prose works as re-arranged and thoroughly revised by
23,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,himself or with his cooperation.  Mr. Whittier has supplied  such
24,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,additional information regarding the subject and occasion of certain
25,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"poems as may be stated in brief head-notes, and this edition has been"
26,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,much enriched by the poet's personal comment. So far as practicable the
27,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"dates of publication of the various articles have been given, and since"
28,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"these were  originally published soon after composition, the dates of"
29,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,their first appearance have been taken as  determining the time at which
30,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"they were written. At the request of the Publishers, Mr. Whittier  has"
31,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"allowed his early poems, discarded from previous collections, to be"
32,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,"placed, in the general order  of their appearance, in an appendix to the"
33,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,final volume of poems. By this means the present edition is made so
34,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,complete and retrospective that students of the poet's career will
35,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,always find the most abundant material for their purpose. The Publishers
36,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,congratulate themselves and the public that the careful attention which
37,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,Mr. Whittier has been able to give to this revision of his works has
38,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,resulted in so comprehensive and well-adjusted a collection.
39,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,
40,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,The portraits prefixed to the several volumes have been chosen with a
41,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,view to illustrating successive periods in the poet's life.  The
42,PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT,original sources and dates are indicated in each case.

224,INTRODUCTION,
225,INTRODUCTION,The edition of my poems published in 1857 contained the following note
226,INTRODUCTION,by way of preface:--
227,INTRODUCTION,
228,INTRODUCTION,"""In these volumes, for the first time, a complete collection of my"
229,INTRODUCTION,poetical writings has been made. While it is satisfactory to know that
230,INTRODUCTION,"these scattered children of my brain have found a home, I cannot but"
231,INTRODUCTION,"regret that I have been unable, by reason of illness, to give that"
232,INTRODUCTION,"attention to their revision and arrangement, which respect for the"
233,INTRODUCTION,opinions of others and my own afterthought and experience demand.
234,INTRODUCTION,
235,INTRODUCTION,"""That there are pieces in this collection which I would 'willingly let"
236,INTRODUCTION,"die,' I am free to confess. But it is now too late to disown them, and I"
237,INTRODUCTION,must submit to the inevitable penalty of poetical as well as other sins.
238,INTRODUCTION,"There are others, intimately connected with the author's life and times,"
239,INTRODUCTION,which owe their tenacity of vitality to the circumstances under which
240,INTRODUCTION,"they were written, and the events by which they were suggested."
241,INTRODUCTION,
242,INTRODUCTION,"""The long poem of Mogg Megone was in a great measure composed in early"
243,INTRODUCTION,life; and it is scarcely necessary to say that its subject is not such
244,INTRODUCTION,"as the writer would have chosen at any subsequent period."""
245,INTRODUCTION,
246,INTRODUCTION,"After a lapse of thirty years since the above was written, I have been"
247,INTRODUCTION,requested by my publishers to make some preparation for a new and
248,INTRODUCTION,revised edition of my poems. I cannot flatter myself that I have added
249,INTRODUCTION,much to the interest of the work beyond the correction of my own errors
250,INTRODUCTION,"and those of the press, with the addition of a few heretofore"
251,INTRODUCTION,"unpublished pieces, and occasional notes of explanation which seemed"
252,INTRODUCTION,necessary. I have made an attempt to classify the poems under a few
253,INTRODUCTION,"general heads, and have transferred the long poem of Mogg Megone to the"
254,INTRODUCTION,"Appendix, with other specimens of my earlier writings. I have endeavored"
255,INTRODUCTION,to affix the dates of composition or publication as far as possible.
256,INTRODUCTION,
257,INTRODUCTION,In looking over these poems I have not been unmindful of occasional
258,INTRODUCTION,"prosaic lines and verbal infelicities, but at this late day I have"
259,INTRODUCTION,neither strength nor patience to undertake their correction.
260,INTRODUCTION,
261,INTRODUCTION,Perhaps a word of explanation may be needed in regard to a class of
262,INTRODUCTION,poems written between the years 1832 and 1865. Of their defects from an
263,INTRODUCTION,artistic point of view it is not necessary to speak. They were the
264,INTRODUCTION,earnest and often vehement expression of the writer's thought and
265,INTRODUCTION,feeling at critical periods in the great conflict between Freedom and
266,INTRODUCTION,Slavery. They were written with no expectation that they would survive
267,INTRODUCTION,"the occasions which called them forth: they were protests, alarm"
268,INTRODUCTION,"signals, trumpet-calls to action, words wrung from the writer's heart,"
269,INTRODUCTION,"forged at white heat, and of course lacking the finish and careful"
270,INTRODUCTION,word-selection which reflection and patient brooding over them might
271,INTRODUCTION,"have given. Such as they are, they belong to the history of the"
272,INTRODUCTION,"Anti-Slavery movement, and may serve as way-marks of its progress. If"
273,INTRODUCTION,"their language at times seems severe and harsh, the monstrous wrong of"
274,INTRODUCTION,"Slavery which provoked it must be its excuse, if any is needed. In"
275,INTRODUCTION,"attacking it, we did not measure our words. ""It is,"" said Garrison,"
276,INTRODUCTION,"""a waste of politeness to be courteous to the devil."" But in truth the"
277,INTRODUCTION,"contest was, in a great measure, an impersonal one,--hatred of slavery"
278,INTRODUCTION,and not of slave-masters.
279,INTRODUCTION,
280,INTRODUCTION,"""No common wrong provoked our zeal,"
281,INTRODUCTION,The silken gauntlet which is thrown
282,INTRODUCTION,"In such a quarrel rings like steel."""
283,INTRODUCTION,
284,INTRODUCTION,"Even Thomas Jefferson, in his terrible denunciation of Slavery in the"
285,INTRODUCTION,"Notes on Virginia, says ""It is impossible to be temperate and pursue the"
286,INTRODUCTION,"subject of Slavery."" After the great contest was over, no class of the"
287,INTRODUCTION,"American people were more ready, with kind words and deprecation of"
288,INTRODUCTION,"harsh retaliation, to welcome back the revolted States than the"
289,INTRODUCTION,Abolitionists; and none have since more heartily rejoiced at the fast
290,INTRODUCTION,increasing prosperity of the South.
291,INTRODUCTION,
292,INTRODUCTION,Grateful for the measure of favor which has been accorded to my
293,INTRODUCTION,"writings, I leave this edition with the public. It contains all that I"
294,INTRODUCTION,"care to re-publish, and some things which, had the matter of choice been"
295,INTRODUCTION,"left solely to myself, I should have omitted."

305,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
306,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,This poem was suggested by the account given of the manner which the
307,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,Waldenses disseminated their principles among the Catholic gentry. They
308,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,gained access to the house through their occupation as peddlers of
309,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"silks, jewels, and trinkets. ""Having disposed of some of their goods,"""
310,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"it is said by a writer who quotes the inquisitor Rainerus Sacco, ""they"
311,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,cautiously intimated that they had commodities far more valuable than
312,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"these, inestimable jewels, which they would show if they could be"
313,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,protected from the clergy. They would then give their purchasers a Bible
314,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"or Testament; and thereby many were deluded into heresy."" The poem,"
315,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"under the title Le Colporteur Vaudois, was translated into French by"
316,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Professor G. de Felice, of Montauban, and further naturalized by"
317,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Professor Alexandre Rodolphe Vinet, who quoted it in his lectures on"
318,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"French literature, afterwards published. It became familiar in this form"
319,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"to the Waldenses, who adopted it as a household poem. An American"
320,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"clergyman, J. C. Fletcher, frequently heard it when he was a student,"
321,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"about the year 1850, in the theological seminary at Geneva, Switzerland,"
322,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,but the authorship of the poem was unknown to those who used it.
323,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Twenty-five years later, Mr. Fletcher, learning the name of the author,"
324,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"wrote to the moderator of the Waldensian synod at La Tour, giving the"
325,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"information. At the banquet which closed the meeting of the synod, the"
326,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"moderator announced the fact, and was instructed in the name of the"
327,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Waldensian church to write to me a letter of thanks. My letter, written"
328,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"in reply, was translated into Italian and printed throughout Italy."
329,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
330,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"""O LADY fair, these silks of mine"
331,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"are beautiful and rare,--"
332,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"The richest web of the Indian loom, which beauty's"
333,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,queen might wear;
334,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"And my pearls are pure as thy own fair neck, with whose"
335,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,radiant light they vie;
336,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"I have brought them with me a weary way,--will my"
337,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"gentle lady buy?"""
338,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
339,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,The lady smiled on the worn old man through the
340,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,dark and clustering curls
341,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Which veiled her brow, as she bent to view his"
342,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,silks and glittering pearls;
343,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,And she placed their price in the old man's hand
344,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"and lightly turned away,"
345,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"But she paused at the wanderer's earnest call,--"
346,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"""My gentle lady, stay!"
347,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
348,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"""O lady fair, I have yet a gem which a purer"
349,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"lustre flings,"
350,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,Than the diamond flash of the jewelled crown on
351,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,the lofty brow of kings;
352,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"A wonderful pearl of exceeding price, whose virtue"
353,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"shall not decay,"
354,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,Whose light shall be as a spell to thee and a
355,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"blessing on thy way!"""
356,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
357,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,The lady glanced at the mirroring steel where her
358,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"form of grace was seen,"
359,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Where her eye shone clear, and her dark locks"
360,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,waved their clasping pearls between;
361,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"""Bring forth thy pearl of exceeding worth, thou"
362,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"traveller gray and old,"
363,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"And name the price of thy precious gem, and my"
364,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"page shall count thy gold."""
365,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
366,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"The cloud went off from the pilgrim's brow, as a"
367,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"small and meagre book,"
368,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Unchased with gold or gem of cost, from his"
369,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,folding robe he took!
370,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"""Here, lady fair, is the pearl of price, may it prove"
371,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,as such to thee
372,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"Nay, keep thy gold--I ask it not, for the word of"
373,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"God is free!"""

375,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"The hoary traveller went his way, but the gift he"

377,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,Hath had its pure and perfect work on that high-
378,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"born maiden's mind,"
379,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,And she hath turned from the pride of sin to the
380,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"lowliness of truth,"
381,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,And given her human heart to God in its beautiful
382,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,hour of youth
383,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,
384,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"And she hath left the gray old halls, where an evil"

386,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,"The courtly knights of her father's train, and the"
387,THE VAUDOIS TEACHER.,maidens of her bower;

877,PENTUCKET.,"The village of Haverhill, on the Merrimac, called by the Indians"
878,PENTUCKET.,"Pentucket, was for nearly seventeen years a frontier town, and during"
879,PENTUCKET.,thirty years endured all the horrors of savage warfare. In the year
880,PENTUCKET.,"1708, a combined body of French and Indians, under the command of De"
881,PENTUCKET.,"Chaillons, and Hertel de Rouville, the famous and bloody sacker of"
882,PENTUCKET.,"Deerfield, made an attack upon the village, which at that time contained"
883,PENTUCKET.,"only thirty houses. Sixteen of the villagers were massacred, and a still"
884,PENTUCKET.,"larger number made prisoners. About thirty of the enemy also fell, among"
885,PENTUCKET.,"them Hertel de Rouville. The minister of the place, Benjamin Rolfe, was"
886,PENTUCKET.,killed by a shot through his own door. In a paper entitled The Border
887,PENTUCKET.,"War of 1708, published in my collection of Recreations and Miscellanies,"
888,PENTUCKET.,I have given a prose narrative of the surprise of Haverhill.
889,PENTUCKET.,
890,PENTUCKET.,
891,PENTUCKET.,How sweetly on the wood-girt town
892,PENTUCKET.,The mellow light of sunset shone!
893,PENTUCKET.,"Each small, bright lake, whose waters still"

895,PENTUCKET.,Reflected from its waveless breast
896,PENTUCKET.,"The beauty of a cloudless west,"
897,PENTUCKET.,Glorious as if a glimpse were given
898,PENTUCKET.,"Within the western gates of heaven,"
899,PENTUCKET.,"Left, by the spirit of the star"
900,PENTUCKET.,"Of sunset's holy hour, ajar!"
901,PENTUCKET.,
902,PENTUCKET.,Beside the river's tranquil flood
903,PENTUCKET.,"The dark and low-walled dwellings stood,"
904,PENTUCKET.,Where many a rood of open land
905,PENTUCKET.,"Stretched up and down on either hand,"
906,PENTUCKET.,With corn-leaves waving freshly green
907,PENTUCKET.,The thick and blackened stumps between.
908,PENTUCKET.,"Behind, unbroken, deep and dread,"
909,PENTUCKET.,"The wild, untravelled forest spread,"
910,PENTUCKET.,"Back to those mountains, white and cold,"
911,PENTUCKET.,"Of which the Indian trapper told,"
912,PENTUCKET.,Upon whose summits never yet
913,PENTUCKET.,Was mortal foot in safety set.
914,PENTUCKET.,
915,PENTUCKET.,"Quiet and calm without a fear,"
916,PENTUCKET.,"Of danger darkly lurking near,"
917,PENTUCKET.,"The weary laborer left his plough,"
918,PENTUCKET.,The milkmaid carolled by her cow;
919,PENTUCKET.,From cottage door and household hearth
920,PENTUCKET.,"Rose songs of praise, or tones of mirth."
921,PENTUCKET.,
922,PENTUCKET.,"At length the murmur died away,"
923,PENTUCKET.,And silence on that village lay.
924,PENTUCKET.,"--So slept Pompeii, tower and hall,"
925,PENTUCKET.,"Ere the quick earthquake swallowed all,"
926,PENTUCKET.,Undreaming of the fiery fate
927,PENTUCKET.,Which made its dwellings desolate.
928,PENTUCKET.,
929,PENTUCKET.,Hours passed away. By moonlight sped
930,PENTUCKET.,The Merrimac along his bed.
931,PENTUCKET.,"Bathed in the pallid lustre, stood"
932,PENTUCKET.,"Dark cottage-wall and rock and wood,"
933,PENTUCKET.,"Silent, beneath that tranquil beam,"
934,PENTUCKET.,As the hushed grouping of a dream.
935,PENTUCKET.,"Yet on the still air crept a sound,"
936,PENTUCKET.,"No bark of fox, nor rabbit's bound,"
937,PENTUCKET.,"Nor stir of wings, nor waters flowing,"
938,PENTUCKET.,Nor leaves in midnight breezes blowing.
939,PENTUCKET.,
940,PENTUCKET.,"Was that the tread of many feet,"
941,PENTUCKET.,Which downward from the hillside beat?
942,PENTUCKET.,What forms were those which darkly stood
943,PENTUCKET.,Just on the margin of the wood?--
944,PENTUCKET.,"Charred tree-stumps in the moonlight dim,"
945,PENTUCKET.,"Or paling rude, or leafless limb?"
946,PENTUCKET.,"No,--through the trees fierce eyeballs glowed,"
947,PENTUCKET.,"Dark human forms in moonshine showed,"
948,PENTUCKET.,"Wild from their native wilderness,"
949,PENTUCKET.,With painted limbs and battle-dress.
950,PENTUCKET.,
951,PENTUCKET.,A yell the dead might wake to hear
952,PENTUCKET.,"Swelled on the night air, far and clear;"
953,PENTUCKET.,Then smote the Indian tomahawk
954,PENTUCKET.,On crashing door and shattering lock;
955,PENTUCKET.,
956,PENTUCKET.,"Then rang the rifle-shot, and then"
957,PENTUCKET.,"The shrill death-scream of stricken men,--"
958,PENTUCKET.,"Sank the red axe in woman's brain,"
959,PENTUCKET.,And childhood's cry arose in vain.
960,PENTUCKET.,"Bursting through roof and window came,"
961,PENTUCKET.,"Red, fast, and fierce, the kindled flame,"
962,PENTUCKET.,And blended fire and moonlight glared
963,PENTUCKET.,On still dead men and scalp-knives bared.
964,PENTUCKET.,
965,PENTUCKET.,The morning sun looked brightly through
966,PENTUCKET.,"The river willows, wet with dew."
967,PENTUCKET.,"No sound of combat filled the air,"
968,PENTUCKET.,"No shout was heard, nor gunshot there;"
969,PENTUCKET.,Yet still the thick and sullen smoke
970,PENTUCKET.,From smouldering ruins slowly broke;
971,PENTUCKET.,"And on the greensward many a stain,"
972,PENTUCKET.,"And, here and there, the mangled slain,"
973,PENTUCKET.,Told how that midnight bolt had sped
974,PENTUCKET.,"Pentucket, on thy fated head."
975,PENTUCKET.,
976,PENTUCKET.,Even now the villager can tell
977,PENTUCKET.,"Where Rolfe beside his hearthstone fell,"
978,PENTUCKET.,"Still show the door of wasting oak,"
979,PENTUCKET.,"Through which the fatal death-shot broke,"
980,PENTUCKET.,And point the curious stranger where
981,PENTUCKET.,De Rouville's corse lay grim and bare;
982,PENTUCKET.,"Whose hideous head, in death still feared,"
983,PENTUCKET.,Bore not a trace of hair or beard;
984,PENTUCKET.,"And still, within the churchyard ground,"
985,PENTUCKET.,"Heaves darkly up the ancient mound,"

1779,THE EXILES.,
1780,THE EXILES.,By green Pentucket's southern'slope
