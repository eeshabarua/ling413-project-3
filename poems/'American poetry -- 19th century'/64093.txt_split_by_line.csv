50,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,
51,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Says the watchman, “And what of the night?"
52,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"It often brings seasons of sorrow,"
53,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,When dark and beclouded with sin;
54,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"But ah! it may sweeten to-morrow,"
55,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,If a ray of God’s favor breaks in.
56,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,How dark and how gloomy was Chaos;
57,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"But God by his own matchless plan,"
58,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Call’d this beautiful world from its darkness,"
59,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And did safe on its axle-tree hang!
60,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"And Jesus, our Savior, was present,"
61,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,For his was the word of command;
62,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"He spangled those orbs in their greatness,"
63,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,For good and for glory to man.”
64,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"The angels in wonder stood gazing,"
65,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Till Sol darts his beams to their view;
66,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,“What is there in the East that is blazing--
67,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,That pearls all the drops of the dew?”
68,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"“’Tis the Sun,” Great Messiah then answered,"
69,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"“’Tis the Sun,” say the angels, “’tis true;"
70,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"From thee it beams glory and greatness,"
71,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And bears up thy own title too.”
72,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,
73,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Great Sol, arise! and spread thy lustre high--"
74,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Go warm the earth, and decorate the sky!"
75,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"When thou retir’st, the silver moon will rise,"
76,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"With pearly radiance, o’er those spangled skies!"
77,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Without a cloud to intercept thy way,"
78,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Go, clearly shine, and make the evening gay!"
79,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"God saw his work was great, when it he view’d,"
80,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Approved the same, and then pronounced it good."
81,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"And why this garden, walled so rich and fair,"
82,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,With glittering stone that is beyond compare--
83,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"With walks, and bowers, and interwoven scenes,"
84,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"With silver rivulets that roll between,"
85,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Tossing their golden pebbles in the stream!
86,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Here richest fruits, in clusters ripe and fair,"
87,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And variegated blooms perfume the air;
88,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Here beast of every kind, playful yet mute,"
89,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"And birds with plumage gay, and warbling throat,"
90,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Chanting to their Maker with melodious note!
91,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"And is the richness of these fruits conceal’d,"
92,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,That grow spontaneous in this fertile field?
93,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Is no one here these sweets to taste? And none the banquet share?
94,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Within these walls is a majestic form,"
95,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Graceful and noble as the rising morn!
96,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Adam! survey thy wond’rous form, and see"
97,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,The image of thy God is stamped on thee!
98,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Be grateful, then, and be obedient, too;"
99,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,For this respect is to thy Sov’reign due.
100,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And here are richest fruits in store for thee;
101,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"And all is thine, except that hallow’d tree:"
102,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"And should’st thou touch it, thou shall surely die!"
103,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,I have pronounced! Ask not the reason why.”
104,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Then Adam bows assent, and walks the rounds,"
105,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,To view the beauties of these fertile grounds--
106,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"He stops to listen to the bubbling stream,"
107,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,That gently trickles down the sloping green;
108,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And on his way he views the crystal pond
109,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Where gold-fish play.
110,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Delighted with the scene, he looks above,"
111,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Adores the greatness of the God of Love.
112,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,But day is done:
113,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Beyond the western hills now sinks the sun.
114,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Adam with wonder views the evening scene--
115,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,The first fair twilight he had ever seen.
116,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"But now with drowsy sleep his eyes are pressed,"
117,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,For God has sanctioned all creation rest.
118,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"In Christian attitude kneels to the shrine,"
119,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And offers up his prayers in words divine;
120,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Then to his mossy pillow Adam goes,"
121,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Nought to disturb or break his soft repose.
122,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"He sleeps secure till morning light appears,"
123,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And birds of Paradise salute his ears.
124,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Then o’er some loaded bough his arm he’s flung,"
125,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Addressed his Maker with his morning song.
126,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Then to the willow’d meads he did repair,"
127,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"To view his flocks, and see them gambol there."
128,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"With scrutiny, he sees each has a friend;"
129,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,In his own bosom he thus contends:
130,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"But why am I exempt, my mind is good,"
131,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And I’ve a speech well to be understood----
132,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"But here’s my Sov’reign.” “Adam, answer! why"
133,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"That downcast look--that soft, expressive sigh?"
134,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Will not a Paradise for thee suffice?”
135,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"“Great Sov’reign! oft I stand in ecstacy,"
136,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Viewing the greatness of thy Deity!
137,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"I know thy works are infinite, supreme,"
138,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And canst answer every wished for scheme.”
139,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,“Adam! I see thy faith is strong;
140,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Speak thy request, nor hesitate too long.”"
141,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"“A friend, a partner give to sweeten life,"
142,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"And then these rural scenes are Paradise,"
143,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Then, Adam, sleep! and to thee I’ll give"
144,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,A form for whom thou’lt ever wish to live.
145,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Then from his side the ivory bone he takes,"
146,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,A beauteous woman of the same he makes.
147,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,But O! our hearts are bent on pleasure here--
148,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,The disappointment oft times is severe.
149,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"But Adam wanders forth we know not where,"
150,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And leaves alone the unprotected fair.
151,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"The fiend, on search, the separation knew--"
152,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"“This is my time, and I’ll improve it, too:"
153,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Say, beauteous Eve, hast thou no greater mind,"
154,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Than to these simple flowers to be confined?
155,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Take this delicious fruit, and then you’ll see"
156,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,That greater glories are in store for thee.”
157,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,“That is forbidden fruit; O no! not I;
158,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"For if I eat, then I must surely die.”"
159,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,“Misrepresented is the fruit I give;
160,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"I eat the same, and yet you see I live.”"
161,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Her innocence had never known a lie;
162,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,So to his treacherous art she did comply.
163,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"She took the apple! When she ate the same,"
164,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,The poisonous juice had tainted every vein.
165,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,But Adam comes.
166,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"“Say, lovely Eve, where is thy beauty fled?"
167,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Where is the bloom that tinged thy cheek with red?
168,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Who has been here?”
169,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,“A treacherous friend! and I believed his lie:
170,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,I ate the apple--I alone must die.
171,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"In some remotest corner let me be,"
172,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"And die alone, dear friend, unseen by thee."
173,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Dear Adam, do not grieve;"
174,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Perhaps thy God will grant another Eve.”
175,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,“No other Eve shall e’er entwine this heart:
176,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Bone of my bone, from thee I cannot part.”"
177,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"He ate the apple, while all nature grieved,"
178,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And every leaf became a sensitive.
179,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"But oh, the black’ning cloud to heaven arose,"
180,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And all the horror of their sins exposed!
181,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"And all was silent till God’s holy Son,"
182,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Array’d in glory, to his Father came."
183,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,“Father of mercies! let thy will be done:
184,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"Oh, cast the sinner’s burden on thy Son;"
185,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"For I alone their advocate will be,"
186,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And their redemption will be found through me.
187,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"For when this world is peopled o’er with men,"
188,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,Then Satan will resume his power again--
189,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"So blind their eyes, and cause their hearts to sin."
190,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,"I will be mortal--I will dwell with them,"
191,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,And cast this monster to his lowest den.
192,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,For on the cross sinners will raise me high:
193,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,For their redemption willingly I die.”
194,THOUGHTS ON CREATION.,But what does God require for sins like this?
