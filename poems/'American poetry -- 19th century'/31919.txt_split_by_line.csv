44,PROEM.,"Till I came where, glad with heat,"

79,I.,Fleet swallows soared and darted
80,I.,'Neath empty vaults of blue;

143,I.,
144,I.,"Green, watery jets of light let through"
145,I.,The rippling foliage drenched with dew;
146,I.,Bland glow-worm glamours warm and dim
147,I.,"Above the mystic vistas swim,"
148,I.,"Where, 'round the fountain's oozy urn,"
149,I.,"The limp, loose fronds of limber fern"
150,I.,"Wave dusky tresses thin and wet,"
151,I.,Blue-filleted with violet.
152,I.,O'er roots that writhe in snaky knots
153,I.,The moss in amber cushions clots;
154,I.,From wattled walls of brier and brush
155,I.,The elder's misty attars gush;
156,I.,"And, Argus-eyed, by knoll and bank"
157,I.,The affluent wild rose flowers rank;
158,I.,"And stol'n in shadowy retreats,"
159,I.,"In black, rich soil, your vision greets"
160,I.,"The colder undergrowths of woods,"
161,I.,"Damp, lushy-leaved, whose gloomier moods"
162,I.,Turn all the life beneath to death
163,I.,And rottenness for their own breath.
164,I.,May-apples waxen-stemmed and large
165,I.,With their bloom-screening breadths of targe;
166,I.,"Wake robins dark-green leaved, their stems"
167,I.,"Tipped with green, oval clumps of gems,"
168,I.,As if some woodland Bacchus there
169,I.,A-braiding of his yellow hair
170,I.,With ivy-tod had idly tost
171,I.,"His thyrsus there, and so had lost."
172,I.,"Low blood root with its pallid bloom,"
173,I.,The red life of its mother's womb
174,I.,Through all its ardent pulses fine
175,I.,Beating in scarlet veins of wine.
176,I.,And where the knotty eyes of trees
177,I.,"Stare wide, like Fauns' at Dryades"
178,I.,"That lave smooth limbs in founts of spar,"
179,I.,Shines many a wild-flower's tender star.

184,II.,"The scummy pond sleeps lazily,"

186,II.,Reels boisterous as a Bassarid
187,II.,Above the bloated green frog hid
188,II.,"In lush wan calamus and grass,"
189,II.,Beside the water's stagnant glass.
190,II.,"The piebald dragon-fly, like one"
191,II.,"A-weary of the world and sun,"
192,II.,"Comes blindly blundering along,"
193,II.,"A pedagogue, gaunt, lean, and long,"
194,II.,"Large-headed naturalist with wise,"
195,II.,"Great, glaring goggles on his eyes."
196,II.,And dry and hot the fragrant mint
197,II.,Pours grateful odors without stint
198,II.,"From cool, clay banks of cressy streams,"
199,II.,"Rare as the musks of rich hareems,"
200,II.,And hot as some sultana's breath
201,II.,With turbulent passions or with death.
202,II.,A haze of floating saffron; sound
203,II.,"Of shy, crisp creepings o'er the ground;"
204,II.,The dip and stir of twig and leaf;
205,II.,Tempestuous gusts of spices brief
206,II.,From elder bosks and sassafras;
207,II.,Wind-cuffs that dodge the laughing grass;
208,II.,"Sharp, sudden songs and whisperings"
209,II.,"That hint at untold hidden things,"
210,II.,Pan and Sylvanus that of old
211,II.,Kept sacred each wild wood and wold.
212,II.,A wily light beneath the trees
213,II.,Quivers and dusks with ev'ry breeze;
214,II.,"Mayhap some Hamadryad who,"
215,II.,Culling her morning meal of dew
216,II.,From frail accustomed cups of flowers--
217,II.,Some Satyr watching through the bowers--
218,II.,"Had, when his goat hoof snapped and pressed"
219,II.,"A brittle branch, shrunk back distressed,"
220,II.,"Startled, her wild, tumultuous hair"
221,II.,Bathing her limbs one instant there.

232,ANTICIPATION.,Sad for the beautiful May.
233,ANTICIPATION.,
234,ANTICIPATION.,On maples tasseled with red
235,ANTICIPATION.,No blithe bird swinging sung;
236,ANTICIPATION.,The brook in its lonely bed
237,ANTICIPATION.,Complained in an unknown tongue.
238,ANTICIPATION.,
239,ANTICIPATION.,We walked in the wasted wood:
240,ANTICIPATION.,"Her face as the Spring's was fair,"
241,ANTICIPATION.,"Her blood was the Spring's own blood,"
242,ANTICIPATION.,"The Spring's her radiant hair,"
243,ANTICIPATION.,
244,ANTICIPATION.,And we found in the windy wild
245,ANTICIPATION.,"One cowering violet,"
246,ANTICIPATION.,Like a frail and tremulous child
247,ANTICIPATION.,In the caked leaves bowed and wet.
248,ANTICIPATION.,
249,ANTICIPATION.,"And I sighed at the sight, with pain"
250,ANTICIPATION.,"For the May's warm face in the wood,"
251,ANTICIPATION.,"May's passions of sun and rain,"
252,ANTICIPATION.,May's raiment of bloom and of bud.
253,ANTICIPATION.,
254,ANTICIPATION.,"But she said when she saw me sad,"
255,ANTICIPATION.,"""Tho' the world be gloomy as fate,"
256,ANTICIPATION.,"And we yearn for the days to be glad,"

258,ANTICIPATION.,
259,ANTICIPATION.,"""For, know, one beautiful thing"
260,ANTICIPATION.,"On the dark day's bosom curled,"
261,ANTICIPATION.,"Makes the wild day glad to sing,"
262,ANTICIPATION.,Content to smile at the world.
263,ANTICIPATION.,
264,ANTICIPATION.,"""For the sinless world is fair,"
265,ANTICIPATION.,And man's is the sin and gloom;
266,ANTICIPATION.,"And dead are the days that were,"
267,ANTICIPATION.,But what are the days to come?
268,ANTICIPATION.,
269,ANTICIPATION.,"""Be happy, dear heart, and wait!"
270,ANTICIPATION.,For the past is a memory:
271,ANTICIPATION.,"Tho' to-day seem somber as fate,"
272,ANTICIPATION.,"Who knows what to-morrow will be?"""

277,ANTICIPATION.,With a twinkle of rustling feet;
278,ANTICIPATION.,"Blooms stormed from her luminous arms,"
279,ANTICIPATION.,And honey of smiles that were sweet.
280,ANTICIPATION.,
281,ANTICIPATION.,"Now I think of her words that day,"
282,ANTICIPATION.,"This day that I longed so to see,"
283,ANTICIPATION.,"That finds her dead with the May,"
284,ANTICIPATION.,And the March but a memory.

2095,THE OHIO FALLS.,"And count his golden guineas on, we'll stay;"
2096,THE OHIO FALLS.,"For hence is the best prospect of the Falls,"
2097,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Whose roar no more astounds the startled ear,"
2098,THE OHIO FALLS.,As when we bent and marked it from the bridge
2099,THE OHIO FALLS.,Seething beneath and bounding like a steed--
2100,THE OHIO FALLS.,A tameless steed with mane of flying spray--
2101,THE OHIO FALLS.,Between the pillars rising sheer above.
2102,THE OHIO FALLS.,"But mark how soft its clamor now is grown,"
2103,THE OHIO FALLS.,Incessant rush like that of vernal groves
2104,THE OHIO FALLS.,"When, like some sweet surprise, a wand'ring wind,"
2105,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Precursor of the coming rain, rides down"
2106,THE OHIO FALLS.,From a gray cloud and sets their leafy tongues
2107,THE OHIO FALLS.,"A-gabbing of the fresh, impending shower."

2109,THE OHIO FALLS.,"There runs the dam, and where its dark line cuts"
2110,THE OHIO FALLS.,"The river's sheen, already you may see"
2111,THE OHIO FALLS.,"The ripples glancing to the fervid sun,"
2112,THE OHIO FALLS.,As if the waves had couched a hundred spears
2113,THE OHIO FALLS.,And tossed a hundred plumes of fleecy foam
2114,THE OHIO FALLS.,"In answer to the challenge of the Falls,"
2115,THE OHIO FALLS.,Blown on his bugle from the battlements
2116,THE OHIO FALLS.,Of his subaqueous city's rocky walls.
2117,THE OHIO FALLS.,"And now you see their maddened coursers charge,"
2118,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Hear wavy hoof-strokes on the jagged stones,"
2119,THE OHIO FALLS.,"That pave the pathway of the current, beat,"
2120,THE OHIO FALLS.,"While billowing they ride to ringing lists,"
2121,THE OHIO FALLS.,"With shout and yell, and toss their hundred plumes,"
2122,THE OHIO FALLS.,And shock their riply spears in tournament
2123,THE OHIO FALLS.,Upon the opposing billows' shining shields.
2124,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Now sinks a pennon, but 'tis raised again;"
2125,THE OHIO FALLS.,There falls or breaks a spear or sparkling sword;
2126,THE OHIO FALLS.,A shattered helmet flies in flakes of foam
2127,THE OHIO FALLS.,And on the frightened wind hisses away:
2128,THE OHIO FALLS.,"And o'er it all you hear the sound, the roar"

2130,THE OHIO FALLS.,
2131,THE OHIO FALLS.,"On, on they come, a beautiful, mad troop!"
2132,THE OHIO FALLS.,"On, on, along the sandy banks that fling"

2135,THE OHIO FALLS.,In casque and shield and wind their wat'ry horns.
2136,THE OHIO FALLS.,
2137,THE OHIO FALLS.,"And there where thousand oily eddies whirl,"
2138,THE OHIO FALLS.,"And turn and turn like busy wheels of steel,"
2139,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Is the Big Eddy, whose deep bottom none"

2141,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Like a huge giant, wily in its strength,"
2142,THE OHIO FALLS.,The Eddy lies; and bending from the shore
2143,THE OHIO FALLS.,"The spotted sycamores have looked and looked,"
2144,THE OHIO FALLS.,Watching his motions as a school boy might
2145,THE OHIO FALLS.,A sleeping serpent coiled upon his path.
2146,THE OHIO FALLS.,So long they've watched that their old backs have grown
2147,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Hump'd, gnarl'd, and crooked, nor seem they this to heed,"
2148,THE OHIO FALLS.,"But gaze and gaze, and from the glossy waves"
2149,THE OHIO FALLS.,Their images stare back their wonderment.
2150,THE OHIO FALLS.,Mayhap they've seen the guardian Genius lie
2151,THE OHIO FALLS.,At its dark bottom in an oozy cave
2152,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Of shattered rock, recumbent on his mace"
2153,THE OHIO FALLS.,Of mineral; his locks of dripping green
2154,THE OHIO FALLS.,Circling a crown of ore; his fishy eyes
2155,THE OHIO FALLS.,Dull with the monotony of his aqueous realms.

2157,THE OHIO FALLS.,But when the storm's abroad and smites the waves
2158,THE OHIO FALLS.,"With stinging lashes of the myriad rain,"
2159,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Or scars with thunder some ancestral oak,"
2160,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Sire of a forest, then he wakes in wrath,"
2161,THE OHIO FALLS.,And on the dark foundations of the stream
2162,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Stands monarch of the flood in iron crown,"
2163,THE OHIO FALLS.,And murmurs till the tempest fiends above
2164,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Stand stark with awe, and all the eddy breaks"
2165,THE OHIO FALLS.,To waves like those whose round and murky bulks.
2166,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Ribbed white with foam, wallow like battened swine"
2167,THE OHIO FALLS.,Along yon ridge of ragged rock o'erstrewn
2168,THE OHIO FALLS.,With petrifactions of Time's earliest dawn;
2169,THE OHIO FALLS.,Mollusks and trilobites and honey-combs
2170,THE OHIO FALLS.,Of coral white; and here and there a mass
2171,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Of what seems writhing reptiles there convolved,"
2172,THE OHIO FALLS.,"And in one moment when the change did come,"
2173,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Which made and unmade continents and seas,"
2174,THE OHIO FALLS.,"That teemed and groaned with dire monstrosities,"
2175,THE OHIO FALLS.,Had froze their glossy spines to sable stones.
2176,THE OHIO FALLS.,
2177,THE OHIO FALLS.,There where uprises a dun knoll o'erstrewn
2178,THE OHIO FALLS.,"With black and rotten stumps in the mid river,"
2179,THE OHIO FALLS.,Erst rose an island green and beautiful
2180,THE OHIO FALLS.,"With willows, beeches, dappled sycamores;"
2181,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Corn Island, on whose rich and fertile soil"
2182,THE OHIO FALLS.,The early pioneers a colony
2183,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Attempted once to found, ere ever this"
2184,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Fair ""City of the Falls""--now echoing to"
2185,THE OHIO FALLS.,The tingling bustle of its busy trade--
2186,THE OHIO FALLS.,Was dreamed of. Here the woodman built
2187,THE OHIO FALLS.,His rude log cabin; here he sowed his maize;
2188,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Here saw it tassel 'neath the Summer's smile,"
2189,THE OHIO FALLS.,And glance like ranks of feathered Indians thro'
2190,THE OHIO FALLS.,The misty vistas of the broken woods;
2191,THE OHIO FALLS.,Here reaped and sheaved its wealth of ivory ears
2192,THE OHIO FALLS.,When Autumn came like a brown Indian maid
2193,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Tripping from the pink sunset o'er the hills,"
2194,THE OHIO FALLS.,That blushed for love and cast beneath her feet
2195,THE OHIO FALLS.,Untold of gold in leaves and yellow fruit.
2196,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Here lived the pioneer and here he died,"
2197,THE OHIO FALLS.,And mingled his rough dust with the raw earth
2198,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Of that long isle which now disparted stands,"
2199,THE OHIO FALLS.,"And nothing save a bed of limestone rock,--"
2200,THE OHIO FALLS.,Where in the quarry you may see the blast
2201,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Spout heavenward the dust and dirt and stone,"
2202,THE OHIO FALLS.,And flap and pound its echoes 'round the hills
2203,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Like giant strokes of some huge airy hammer,--"
2204,THE OHIO FALLS.,And that lone mound of stumpy earth to show
2205,THE OHIO FALLS.,That there once stood an isle as rich and fair
2206,THE OHIO FALLS.,As any isle that rises up to kiss
2207,THE OHIO FALLS.,The sun and dream in tropic seas of balm.
2208,THE OHIO FALLS.,
2209,THE OHIO FALLS.,There lies the other half of what was once
2210,THE OHIO FALLS.,Corn Island; a broad channel flows between.
2211,THE OHIO FALLS.,"And this low half, mantled with a dwarf growth"
2212,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Of what was once high brakes and forest land,"
2213,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Goose Island now is named. In the dim morn,"
2214,THE OHIO FALLS.,Ere yet the East assumes her faintest blush.
2215,THE OHIO FALLS.,Here may you hear the melancholy snipe
2216,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Piping, or see her paddling in the pools"
2217,THE OHIO FALLS.,That splash the low bed of the rocky isle.
2218,THE OHIO FALLS.,
2219,THE OHIO FALLS.,Once here the Indian stole in natural craft
2220,THE OHIO FALLS.,"From brush to brush, his head plumes like a bird"
2221,THE OHIO FALLS.,Flutt'ring and nodding 'mid the undergrowth;
2222,THE OHIO FALLS.,"In his brown hand the pliant, polished bow,"
2223,THE OHIO FALLS.,And at his back his gaudy quiver filled
2224,THE OHIO FALLS.,With tufted arrows headed with blue flint.
2225,THE OHIO FALLS.,And while the deep flamingo colored West
2226,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Flamed on his ruddy cheek its airy fire,"
2227,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Strung his quick bow and thro' the gray wild goose,"
2228,THE OHIO FALLS.,"That rose with clamor from the rushy pool,"
2229,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Launched a fleet barb, crested with quills--perchance"
2230,THE OHIO FALLS.,Plucked yestere'en from its dead mate's gray wing
2231,THE OHIO FALLS.,To decorate the painted shaft that should
2232,THE OHIO FALLS.,Dabble to-day their white in its mate's blood;--
2233,THE OHIO FALLS.,"It falling, gasping at its moccasined feet,"
2234,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Its wild life breathed away, while the glad brave"
2235,THE OHIO FALLS.,"Whooped to the sunset, and yon faint blue hills"
2236,THE OHIO FALLS.,Answered his exultation with a whoop.

2247,THE RUINED MILL.,Where the water snake coils dim and cool
2248,THE RUINED MILL.,In the flaky light of the setting sun
2249,THE RUINED MILL.,Showering his gold in bullion.
2250,THE RUINED MILL.,And the languid daisies nod and shine
2251,THE RUINED MILL.,By the trickling fall in a starry line;
2252,THE RUINED MILL.,The drowsy daisies with eyes of gold--
2253,THE RUINED MILL.,Large as the eyes of a queen of old
2254,THE RUINED MILL.,Dreaming of revels by day and night--
2255,THE RUINED MILL.,Coyly o'erdropped with lashes white.
2256,THE RUINED MILL.,"The hawk sails high in the sleepy air,"
2257,THE RUINED MILL.,The buzzard on wings as strong and fair

2261,THE RUINED MILL.,Will ye enter with me this ruined mill
2262,THE RUINED MILL.,"When the shades of night its chambers fill,"
2263,THE RUINED MILL.,Stand and lurk in the heavy dark
2264,THE RUINED MILL.,"Like scowling fiends, each eye a spark,"
2265,THE RUINED MILL.,A spark of moonlight shot thro' gloom?
2266,THE RUINED MILL.,"While a moist, rank, stifling, dead perfume"
2267,THE RUINED MILL.,"Of rotting timbers and rotting grain,"
2268,THE RUINED MILL.,And roofs all warped with the sun and rain
2269,THE RUINED MILL.,"Makes of the stagnant air a cell,"
2270,THE RUINED MILL.,In the haunted chambers broods like a spell?
2271,THE RUINED MILL.,A spell that makes the awed mind run
2272,THE RUINED MILL.,"To the thoughts of a hidden skeleton,"
2273,THE RUINED MILL.,A skeleton ghastly and livid and lank
2274,THE RUINED MILL.,"'Neath the mossy floors in a cellar dank,"
2275,THE RUINED MILL.,"Grinning and glow'ring, moisture wet,"
2276,THE RUINED MILL.,In its hollow eyes a mad regret.
2277,THE RUINED MILL.,
2278,THE RUINED MILL.,Or with me enter when the evening star
2279,THE RUINED MILL.,"In the saffron heaven is sparkling afar,"
2280,THE RUINED MILL.,"In all its glory of light divine,"
2281,THE RUINED MILL.,Like a diamond bathed in kingly wine.
2282,THE RUINED MILL.,"Or when the heavens hang wild and gray,"
2283,THE RUINED MILL.,And the chilly clouds are hurrying away
2284,THE RUINED MILL.,Like the driven leaves of an Autumn day;
2285,THE RUINED MILL.,"When the night-rain sounds on the sodden roof,"
2286,THE RUINED MILL.,And the spider lulls in his dusty woof;
2287,THE RUINED MILL.,"When the wet wind whines like a hound that's lashed,"
2288,THE RUINED MILL.,"'Round the crazy angles strongly dashed,"
2289,THE RUINED MILL.,Or wails in a cranny--'tis she who plays
2290,THE RUINED MILL.,"On her airy harp sad, olden lays,"

3997,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,In the soft utterance of my low speech!
3998,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,And I will flutter all my amber curls
3999,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,To cast wind currents o'er thy pallid brow!--
4000,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Drink deepest sleep, for, see, I catch thy doom!--"
4001,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,So pale thy face which glimmers thro' the night!
4002,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,So pale! and knew I death as mortals know
4003,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,I'd say that he mysterious had on thee
4004,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Laid hands of talons and so slain thy soul!
4005,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,So still! and all the night bears down my heart!
4006,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,So pale!--and sleep is lost to thee and me!--
4007,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Sleep, that were welcome in this heavy gloom!--"
4008,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,It clings to me like pestilential fogs!
4009,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,I seem but clodded filth and float in filth!
4010,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,It chokes my words and claws them from my tongue
4011,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,To sound as dull confusèd as the boom
4012,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Heard thro' the stagnant earth when armies meet
4013,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"With ring of war-ax on the brazen helms,"
4014,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,And all the mountains clash unto the sound
4015,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Of shocking spears that splinter on gray ore!
4016,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,For by dead banks of stone my words are yelled
4017,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,While yet they touch the tongue to grasp the thought;
4018,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,And all the creatures huddled in their holes
4019,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Creep forth to glare and hiss them back again!
4020,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Yet, for thy love, O Loke, could I brave"

4022,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Heap on, and, suff'ring, love thee all the more!"
4023,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,
4024,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"""For thou dost love me, and this life is naught"
4025,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Without thy majesty of form and mind,"

4028,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"I raise the puny hillock of my soul,"
4029,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Tho' oft it droops below thy lofty height,"
4030,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Far 'mid the crimson clouds of windless dawns
4031,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Reaching the ruby of a glorious crest.
4032,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"And then aspire I not, but cower in awe"
4033,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Down 'mid low, printless winds that take no morn.--"
4034,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,
4035,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"""At least my countenance may win from thee"
4036,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,A reflex of that alabaster cold
4037,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"That stones thy brow, and pale in kindred woe!"
4038,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,And when this stony brow of thine is cleft
4039,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"By myriad furrows, tortures of slow Time,"
4040,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"And all the beauties of thy locks are past,"
4041,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Now glossy as the brown seal's velvet fur,"
4042,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Their drifts of winter strown around this cave
4043,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"To gray the glutton gloom that hangs like lead,--"
4044,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"For Idunn's fruit is now debarred thy lips,"
4045,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,And thou shalt age e'en as I age with thee!--
4046,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Then will the thought of that dread twilight cheer
4047,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,The burthen of thy anguish; for wilt thou
4048,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Not in the great annihilation aid
4049,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Of gods and worlds, that roll thro' misty grooves"
4050,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Of cycled ages to wild Ragnaroke?
4051,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Then shalt thou joy! for all those stars which glue
4052,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Their blinking scales unto old Ymer's skull
4053,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,In clots shall fall! and as this brooding night
4054,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Sticks to and gluts us till we strangling clutch
4055,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,With purple lips for air--and feel but frost
4056,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Drag laboring down the throat to swell the freight

4064,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,And twists his scaly coils that livid hang
4065,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Above thee alabaster as a shrine!--
4066,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Oh, could I kiss the lips toward which he writhes"
4067,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,And yield them the last spark of living flame
4068,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"That burns in my wan blood, and, yielding--die!"
4069,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Oh, could I gaze once more into large eyes"

4071,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,And see them as they glowed when Morning danced
4072,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,O'er scattered flowers from the rosy hills

4076,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,And rocked and sang unto the smooth fiords
4077,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Like old wild women to their sleeping babes!
4078,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Then could I die e'en as the mortals die,"
4079,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,And smile in dying!--But the reptile baulks
4080,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"All effort to behold, or on white lips"
4081,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,To feast the ardor of my vain desire!
4082,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,Thy face alone shines on my straining sight
4083,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Like some dim moon beneath a night of mist,--"
4084,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,And now the creatures come to feel at me--

4125,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,
4126,THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.,"Her sorrow found some vent in rain of tears,"
