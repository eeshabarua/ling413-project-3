56,I. LE VIOL D’AMOUR.,"O soft, caressing sound, more sweet than scent"
57,I. LE VIOL D’AMOUR.,Of violets in woody hollows! Tone
58,I. LE VIOL D’AMOUR.,As amorous as the ring-dove’s tender moan
59,I. LE VIOL D’AMOUR.,Beneath the spreading forest’s leafy tent;
60,I. LE VIOL D’AMOUR.,What mystery of earth or air hath lent
61,I. LE VIOL D’AMOUR.,"Thee that bewitching music, where the drone"
62,I. LE VIOL D’AMOUR.,Of Summer bees in dewy buds new blown
63,I. LE VIOL D’AMOUR.,"With trembling, fainting melody is blent?"
64,I. LE VIOL D’AMOUR.,"What master did conceive thee, as the sound"

67,I. LE VIOL D’AMOUR.,"The passion of her lover first exprest,"

84,II. VESPERS.,Where fainting incense clouds the heavy air
85,II. VESPERS.,"My lady’s kneeling at her evening prayer,"
86,II. VESPERS.,Alone and silently; for in a file
87,II. VESPERS.,"The choristers have passed, and left her there,"
88,II. VESPERS.,"Where martyrs from the tinted windows stare,"
89,II. VESPERS.,And saints look downward with a holy smile
90,II. VESPERS.,"Upon her meek devotions, while the day"
91,II. VESPERS.,"Fades slowly, and a tender amber light"
92,II. VESPERS.,From coloured panes about her head doth play--
93,II. VESPERS.,"Her veil falls like a shade, and ghostly white"
94,II. VESPERS.,Her clasped hands glimmer through the deepening gray;

112,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Could youth discrown thy head of its gray hair,"
113,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,I could not love it as I love it now;
114,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Could one grand line be smoothed from thy brow,"
115,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,’Twould seem to me less stately and less fair.
116,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"O no, be as thou art! For thou dost wear"

152,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,For callow younglings in the nest;
153,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,
154,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"The flush of branches with fair blossoms,"
155,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"The deepening of the faint green boughs,"
156,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,As leaf by leaf the crown grows fuller
157,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,That binds the young Spring’s rosy brows;
158,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,
159,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"New promise every day of sweetness,"

172,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,I found a wee leaf in the cleft
173,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,Where the half-melted ice had left
174,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"A sunny corner, moist and warm,"
175,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"For it to bud, beyond all harm."
176,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"The wet, brown sod,"
177,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Long horned with ice, had slowly grown"
178,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"So soft, the tender seedling blown"
179,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"By Autumn winds, in earliest Spring"
180,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Sent through the sun-warmed covering,"
181,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,Its little leaf to God.
182,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,
183,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"I found it there, beneath a ledge,"
184,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"The dawning Spring time’s fairest pledge,"
185,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,And to my mind it dimly brought
186,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"The sudden, joyous, leafy thought"
187,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,Of Summer-time.
188,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,I plucked it from the sheltered cleft
189,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,Which the more kindly ice had left.
190,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Within my hand to drop and die,"

205,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,The hours of our young delight?
206,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Are they forever gone and dead,"
207,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,Or only vanished out of sight?
208,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,
209,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,O can it be that we shall live
210,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"To know once more the joys gone by,"
211,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"To feel the old, deep love revive,"
212,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,And smile again before we die?
213,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,
214,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Could I but fancy it might be,"

218,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,
219,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"O Love, those hours are past away"

236,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,Beyond the humble reach of every day.
237,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,And only near us when we weep or pray;
238,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"But rather in the household and the street,"
239,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Where loudest is the noise of hurrying feet,"
240,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Where hearts beat thickest, where our duties call,"
241,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Where watchers sit, where tears in silence fall."
242,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"We know not, or forget, there is no line"

246,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"God leaves the doors between them open wide,"
247,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Knowing how life and death are close allied,"
248,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"And though across the threshold, in the gloom,"
249,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"We cannot see into that other room,"
250,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,It may be that the dear ones watching there
251,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Can hear our cry of passionate despair,"
252,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,And wait unseen to lead us through the door
253,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"When twilight comes, and all our work is o’er."

269,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,Yet heard the first low calling of the voice
270,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"That others had not heeded in the noise,"
271,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"And rising, when it whispered “Come with me,”"
272,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Followed the form that others could not see,"
273,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"Smiling, perchance, in death at last to hear"
274,III. BETTINE TO GOETHE.,"The voices of the Angels fill her ear,"

315,WALTHER.,The roses on thy cheeks would woo

345,A BALLAD.,
346,A BALLAD.,In our town there dwelt a maiden
347,A BALLAD.,Whom the folk called Marian;
348,A BALLAD.,In her narrow gabled casement
349,A BALLAD.,All day long she sat and span.
350,A BALLAD.,
351,A BALLAD.,Till a gentleman came riding
352,A BALLAD.,"Through our town one Summer day,"
353,A BALLAD.,"Spied May Marian at the casement,"
354,A BALLAD.,Stole her silly heart away.
355,A BALLAD.,
356,A BALLAD.,"Then she up and left her spinning,"
357,A BALLAD.,"Laid aside her russet gown,"
358,A BALLAD.,In a footboy’s cap and mantle
359,A BALLAD.,Followed him to London town.
360,A BALLAD.,
361,A BALLAD.,There he led her to a mansion
362,A BALLAD.,Standing by the river side;
363,A BALLAD.,“In that mansion dwells the lady
364,A BALLAD.,Who is my betrothed bride;
365,A BALLAD.,
366,A BALLAD.,"“Gif thou’lt be her serving-maiden,"

370,A BALLAD.,
371,A BALLAD.,"“But if thou’lt not be her maiden,"
372,A BALLAD.,Turn about and get thee home;
373,A BALLAD.,’Tis not meet that country wenches
374,A BALLAD.,Through the city here should roam.”
375,A BALLAD.,
376,A BALLAD.,Not a word in answer spake she;
377,A BALLAD.,"Weeping sore she turned away,"
378,A BALLAD.,"And alone she gat her homeward,"
379,A BALLAD.,Travelling till the fall of day.
380,A BALLAD.,
381,A BALLAD.,"To our town she came at gloaming,"
382,A BALLAD.,Softly tirled she at the door;
383,A BALLAD.,"Whispered: “let me in, sweet mother,"
384,A BALLAD.,I will wander never more.”
385,A BALLAD.,
386,A BALLAD.,"“I will turn me to my spinning,"
387,A BALLAD.,I will don my russet gown;
388,A BALLAD.,"Home is best for country lasses,"
389,A BALLAD.,Men are false in London town.”
390,A BALLAD.,
391,A BALLAD.,"But the door was shut against her,"
392,A BALLAD.,To her prayer came answer none.
393,A BALLAD.,"All night long alone she wandered,"
394,A BALLAD.,Wandered weeping through our town.
395,A BALLAD.,
396,A BALLAD.,But at dawn she was aweary--
397,A BALLAD.,In the street she laid her down;
398,A BALLAD.,And they found her dead at sunrise
399,A BALLAD.,With her head upon a stone.
