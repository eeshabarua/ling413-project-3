56,PREFACE,"To those who may favor these pages with perusal, I make this earnest"
57,PREFACE,"request: that, if they commence, they will read all. Knowing that the"
58,PREFACE,"best mode of dealing with doubts is to state and refute, successively, I"
59,PREFACE,regret that the plan of the present work forces a separation of the
60,PREFACE,statement and refutation. To read one without the other were to defeat
61,PREFACE,the object in view; hence my request.
62,PREFACE,
63,PREFACE,"Many of the subjects of thought are worn smooth with the touch of ages,"
64,PREFACE,so that hope for originality is as slender as the bridge of Al Sirat;
65,PREFACE,"but in the bulrush ark of self-confidence, pitched with Faith, I commit"
66,PREFACE,my first-born to the Nile of public opinion; whether to perish by
67,PREFACE,"crocodile critics, or bask in the palace of favor, the Future, alone,"
68,PREFACE,must determine. May Pharaoh’s daughter find it!

80,A NOTE,"_First published more than thirty-five years ago, in the lifetime of the"
81,A NOTE,"poet, THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD has long since passed not only out of print"
82,A NOTE,but out of the memory of most living men. Of the copies of the original
83,A NOTE,"edition, only few are known to exist. Upon his surviving family is"
84,A NOTE,"imposed the obligation, and to them comes the privilege, of rescuing"
85,A NOTE,from the realm of forgotten things these evidences of a graceful and
86,A NOTE,genuine poetic gift in one whose memory they revere and whose genius
87,A NOTE,they are unwilling to have die. It is therefore with the sense of
88,A NOTE,performing a grateful duty that they have caused to be printed this new
89,A NOTE,"edition of Edwin Fuller’s poems, in the hope and belief that others,"
90,A NOTE,"like themselves, will value it both as friends of the gentle poet and as"
91,A NOTE,disinterested lovers of good literature._

98,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD
99,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
100,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
101,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"’Twas noon in August, and the sultry heat"
102,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Had driven me from sunny balcony
103,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Into the shaded hall, where spacious doors"
104,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Stood open wide, and lofty windows held"
105,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Their sashes up, to woo the breeze, in vain."
106,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The filmy lace that curtained them was still,"
107,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And every silken tassel hung a-plumb.
108,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The maps and unframed pictures o’er the wall
109,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Gave not a rustle; only now and then
110,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Was heard the jingling sound of melting ice,"
111,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Deep in a massive urn, whose silver sides"
112,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With trickling dewbeads ran. The little birds,"
113,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Up in their cages, perched with open beaks,"
114,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And throbbing throats, upon the swaying rings,"
115,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or plashed the tepid water in their cups
116,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With eager breast. My favorite pointer lay,"
117,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With lolling tongue, and rapid panting sides,"
118,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Beside my chair, upon the matted floor."
119,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All things spoke heat, oppressive heat intense,"
120,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Save swallows twittering up the chimney-flue,"
121,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whose hollow flutterings sounded cool alone.
122,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To find relief I seized my hat and book,"
123,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And fled into the park. Along a path
124,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of smoothest gravel, oval, curving white,"
125,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Between two rows of closely shaven hedge,"
126,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I passed towards a latticed summer-house;
127,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A fairy bower, built in Eastern style,"
128,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With spires, and balls, and fancy trellis-work,"
129,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"O’er which was spread the jasmine’s leafy net,"
130,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To snare the straying winds. Within I fell
131,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon a seat of woven cane, and fanned"
132,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,My streaming face in vain. The very winds
133,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Seemed to have fled, and left alone the heat"
134,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To rise from parchèd lawn and scorching fields,"
135,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Like trembling incense to the blazing god.
136,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The leaves upon the wan and yellow trees
137,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Hung motionless, as if of rigid steel;"
138,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And e’en the feath’ry pendula of spray,"
139,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With faintest oscillation, dared not wave."
140,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The withered flowers shed a hot perfume,"
141,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That sickened with its fragrance; and the bees
142,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Worked lazily, as if they longed to kick"
143,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The yellow burdens from their patient thighs,"
144,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And rest beneath the ivy parasols.
145,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The butterflies refrained from aimless flight,"
146,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And poised on blooms with gaudy, gasping wings."
147,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The fountain scarcely raised its languid jet
148,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,An inch above its tube; the basin deigned
149,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A feeble ripple for its tinkling fall,"
150,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And rolled the little waves with noiseless beat
151,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Against the marble side. The bright-scaled fish
152,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All huddled ’neath the jutting ledge’s shade,"
153,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Where, burnished like their magnet toy types,"
154,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,They rose and fell as if inanimate;
155,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or, with a restless stroke of tinted fin,"
156,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Turned in their places pettishly around;
157,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While, with each move, the tiny whirlpools spun"
158,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Like crystal dimples on the water’s face.
159,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The sculptured lions crouched upon the edge,"
160,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With gaping jaws, and stony, fixèd eyes,"
161,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That ever on the pool glared thirstily.
162,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Deep in the park, beneath the trees, were grouped"
163,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The deer, their noses lowered to the earth,"
164,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To snuff a cooler air; their slender feet
165,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Impatient stamping at the teasing flies;
166,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While o’er their heads the branching antlers spread,"
167,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A mocking skeleton of shade! A fawn,"
168,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Proud of his dappled coat, played here and there,"
169,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Regardless of repose; the silver bell,"
170,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That tinkled from a band of broidered silk,"
171,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Proclaiming him a petted favorite.
172,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Save him alone, all things in view sought rest,"
173,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And wearied Nature seemed to yield the strife,"
174,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And smold’ring wait her speedy sacrifice.
175,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
176,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The heat grew hotter as I watched its work,"
177,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And with its fervor overcome, I rose,"
178,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And through the grounds, towards an orchard bent"
179,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,My faltering steps in full despair of ease.
180,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Down through the lengthened rows of laden trees,"
181,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Whose golden-freighted boughs o’erlapped the way,"
182,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I hurried till I reached the last confines.
183,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Here stood a gnarléd veteran, now too old"
184,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To bear much fruit, but weaving with its leaves"
185,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So dense a shade, the smallest fleck of sun"
186,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Could not creep through. Beneath it spread a couch
187,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of velvet moss, fit for the slumbers of a king."
188,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Here prone I fell, at last amid a scene"
189,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That promised refuge from the glaring heat.
190,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Beyond me stretched the orchard’s canopy
191,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of thick, rank foliage, almost drooping down"
192,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Upon the green plush carpet underneath.
193,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Close at my feet a crystal spring burst forth,"
194,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And rolled its gurgling waters down the glade
195,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Now spreading in a rilling silver sheet
196,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"O’er some broad rock, then gath’ring at its base"
197,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Into a foamy pool that churned the sand,"
198,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And mingling sparks of shining isinglass,"
199,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It danced away o’er gleamy, pebbly bed,"
200,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Where, midst the grassy nooks and fibrous roots,"
201,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The darting minnows played at hide and seek,"
202,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Oft fluttering upwards, to the top, to spit"
203,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A tiny bubble out, or slyly snap"
204,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Th’ unwary little insect hov’ring near;
205,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till, by its tributes widened to a brook,"
206,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It poured its limpid waters undefiled
207,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In to the river’s dun and dirty waves,--"
208,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A type of childhood’s guileless purity,"
209,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That mingling with the sordid world is lost.
210,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
211,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Far in the distance, lofty mountains loomed,"
212,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Their blue sides trembling in the sultry haze.
213,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From me to them spread varicultured fields,"
214,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That formed a patchwork landscape, which deserved"
215,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The pencil of a Rembrandt and his skill;
216,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The hardy yellow stubble smoothly shaved,"
217,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,With boldness lying ’neath the scorching sun;
218,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The suffering corn, with tasselled heads all bowed,"
219,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And twisted arms appealing, raised to Heaven;"
220,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The meadows faded by the constant blaze;
221,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The cattle lying in the hedge’s shade;
222,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Across the landscape drawn a glitt’ring band,"
223,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Where winds the river, like a giant snake,"
224,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The ripples flashing like his polished scales.
225,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Above the scene a lonely vulture wheeled,"
226,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Turning with every curve from side to side,"
227,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As if the fierce rays broiled his dusky wings;
228,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And circling onwards, dwindled to a speck,"
229,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And in the distance vanished out of sight!
230,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Complete repose was stamped on everything,"
231,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Save where a tireless ant tugged at a crumb,"
232,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To drag it o’er th’ impeding spires of moss;
233,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And one poor robin, with her breast all pale"
234,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And feather-scarce, hopped wearily along"
235,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The streamlet’s edge, with plaintive clock-like chirp,"
236,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And searching, found and bore the curling worm,"
237,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Up to the yellow-throated brood o’erhead.
238,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Behind the mountains reared the copper clouds
239,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of summer skies, that whitened as they rose,"
240,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till bleached to snow, they drifted dreamily,"
241,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Like gleaming icebergs, through the blue sublime."
242,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And as they, one by one, sailed far away,"
243,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Methought they were as ships from Earth to Heaven,"
244,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Thus slowly floating to the Eternal Port.
245,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Thunder’s muttered growl my reverie broke,"
246,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And looking toward the West, I saw a storm,"
247,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With gloomy wrath, had thrown its dark-blue line"
248,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of breastworks, quiv’ring with each grand discharge"
249,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of its own ordnance, o’er th’ horizon’s verge."
250,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some time it stood to gloat upon its prey,"
251,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then, girding up its strength, began its march."
252,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Extending far its black gigantic arms,"
253,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It grimly clambered up the tranquil sky;
254,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till, half-way up the arch, its shaggy brows"
255,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Scowled down in rage upon the frightened earth;
256,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While through its wind-cleft portals sped the darts,"
257,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That brightly hurtled through the sultry air.
258,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And down the mountain-sides the shadow crept,"
259,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A dark veil spreading over field and wood,"
260,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Thus adding gloom to Nature’s awful hush.
261,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The fleecy racks had fled far to the East,"
262,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Where sporting safely in the gilding light,"
263,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,They mocked the angry monster’s cumbrous speed.
264,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
265,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then, while I marked its progress, came a train,"
266,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of dark and doubting thoughts into my mind,"
267,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And bitterly thus my reflections ran:
268,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Strange is the Providence that rules the world,"
269,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That sets the Medean course of Nature’s laws;
270,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Sometimes adapting law to circumstance,"
271,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But oftener making law fulfilled a curse.
272,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yon brewing storm in verdant summer comes,"
273,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When vegetation spreads its foliage sails,"
274,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That, like a full-rigged ship’s, are easier torn;"
275,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Why comes it not in winter, when the trees,"
276,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With canvas reefed by Autumn’s furling frosts,"
277,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Could toss in nude defiance to the blast?
278,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The murd’rous wind precedes the gentle shower
279,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And ere the suffering grain has quenched its thirst,"
280,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It bows the heavy head, alone of worth,"
281,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And from the ripening stalk wrings out the life,"
282,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,While gayly nod the heads of chaff unharmed.
283,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The rank miasma floats in summer-time,"
284,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,When man must brave its poisoned breath or starve;
285,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It hovers sickliest over richest fields
286,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,While over sterile lands the air is pure;
287,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The tallest oak is by the lightning riven,"
288,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The hateful bramble on the ground is spared;
289,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The crop man needs demands his constant work,"
290,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The weeds alone spring forth without the plow;
291,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The sweetest flowers wear the sharpest thorns,"
292,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The deadliest reptiles lurk in fairest paths!
293,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Wherever Nature shows her brightest smile,"
294,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,’Tis but a mask to hide her darkest frown.
295,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The tropics seem an Eden of luscious fruits
296,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And flowers, and groves of loveliest birds, and lakes"
297,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That mirror their gay plumage flitting o’er;
298,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Where man may live in luxury of thought,"
299,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Without the crime of schemes, or curse of toil--"
300,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The tropics seem a Hell, when all with life"
301,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Are stifled with the foul sirocco’s breath;
302,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When from the green-robed mountain’s volcan top,"
303,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A fire-fountain spouts its blazing jet
304,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Far up against the starry dome of Heaven;
305,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Returning in its vast umbrella shape,"
306,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Leaps in red cataracts adown the slope,"
307,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Shaves clean the mountain of its emerald hair,"
308,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And leaves it bald with ashes on its head.
309,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Below, the valley is a crimson sea,"
310,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whose glowing billows break to white-hot foam;
311,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And as they surge amid the towering trees,"
312,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They, tottering, bow forever to the waves;"
313,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The leaves and branches, crackling into flame,"
314,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Leave only clotted cinders floating there;
315,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The darting birds, their gaudy plumage singed,"
316,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Fall fluttering in, with little puffs of smoke."
317,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The fleeing beasts are lapped in, bellowing,"
318,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And charred to coal, drift idly with the tide."
319,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The red flood, breaking through the vale, rolls on"
320,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Its devious way towards the sea; the glare
321,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Illuminating far its winding track,"
322,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As if a devil flew with flaming torch,"
323,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or when an earthquake gapes its black-lined jaws,"
324,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And, growling, gulps a city’s busy throng"
325,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Into its greedy bowels. Or the sea bursts forth
326,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its bands of rock, and laughing at “Thus far!”"
327,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Rolls wildly over peopled towns, and homes"
328,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In fancied safety; playing fearful pranks,"
329,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,O’er which to chuckle in its briny bed;
330,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Jeering the stones because they cannot swim,"
331,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And crushing like a shell all work of wood;
332,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Docking the laden ships upon the hills,"
333,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And tossing lighter craft about like weeds;
334,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till, wearied with the spoiling, sinks to rest."
335,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
336,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Thus Nature to herself is but half kind,"
337,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But over man holds fullest tyranny;
338,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And man, a creature who cannot prevent"
339,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,His own existence! Why not happy made?
340,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For surely ’twere as easy to create
341,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man in a state of happiness and good,"
342,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And keep him there, as to create at all."
343,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If misery’s not deserved before his birth,"
344,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Then misery must from purest malice flow;
345,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet malice none assign to Providence.
346,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But some may say: Were man thus happy made,"
347,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He would not be a person, but a thing,"
348,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And lose the very seed of happiness,"
349,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The consciousness of merit. Grant ’tis true!
350,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Then why does merit rarely meet reward?
351,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And why does there appear a tendency,"
352,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Throughout the polity divine, to mark"
353,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With disapproval all the good in man,"
354,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And bless the evil? Through the entire world
355,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is felt this conflict: some strange power within
356,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Exciting us to good, while all events"
357,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Proclaim its folly. Throughout Nature’s laws,"
358,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Through man in every station, up to God,"
359,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"This fatal contradiction glares. The storm,"
360,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With ruthless breath, annihilates the cot"
361,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That, frail and humble, shields the widow’s head;"
362,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And while she reads within the use-worn Book
363,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That none who trusts shall e’er be desolate,"
364,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The falling timbers crush the promise out,"
365,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And she is dead beneath her ruined home!
366,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The prostrate cottage passed, the very wind"
367,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Now howls a rough but fawning lullaby
368,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Around the marble walls, and lofty dome,"
369,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That shelter pride and heartless arrogance.
370,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
371,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And when the Boaz Winter throws his skirt
372,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of purest white across the lap of Earth,"
373,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And decks her bare arborial hair with gems,"
374,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Whose feeblest flash would pale the Koh-i-noor,"
375,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The rich, alone, find beauty in the scene,"
376,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And, clad in thankless comfort, brave the cold."
377,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The gliding steels flash through the feathery drifts,"
378,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The jingling bells proclaiming happiness;
379,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet ’neath the furry robe the oath is heard,"
380,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And boisterous laughter at the ribald jest.
381,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The coldest hearts beat ’neath the warmest clothes;
382,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And often all the blessings wealth can give,"
383,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are heaped on one, whose daily life reviles"
384,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The very name of Him who doth bestow.
385,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While in a freezing garret, o’er the coals"
386,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That, bluely flickering with the feeble flame,"
387,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Seem cold themselves, a trusting Christian bends;"
388,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Her faith all mocked by cruel circumstance.
389,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The cold, bare walls, the chilling air-swept floor;"
390,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some broken stools, a mattress stuffed with straw,"
391,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upholstering the apartment. Through the sash,"
392,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The wind, with jaggèd lips of broken glass,"
393,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Shrieks in its freezing spite. A cold-blued babe,"
394,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With face too thin to hold a dimple’s print,"
395,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With famished gums tugs at the arid breast,"
396,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Thrusting its bare, splotched arms, in eagerness,"
397,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,From out the poor white blanket’s ravelled edge.
398,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Beside the mother sits a little boy,"
399,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With one red frost-cracked hand spread out, in vain,"
400,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To warm above the faintly-burning coals;
401,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The other pressing hardly ’gainst his teeth
402,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A stale and tasteless loaf of smallest size,"
403,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Which lifting often to the mother’s view,"
404,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He offers part; she only shakes her head,"
405,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And sadly smiles upon the gaunt young face.
406,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet in her basket, on a pile of work,"
407,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"An open Bible lies with outstretched leaves,"
408,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whose verses speak in keenest irony:
409,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“Do good,” and “verily thou shalt be fed.”"
410,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And so through all the world, the righteous poor,"
411,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The wicked rich. Deceit, and fraud, and craft"
412,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Reap large rewards, while pure integrity"
413,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Must gnaw the bone of faith with here and there
414,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A speck of flesh called consciousness of right,"
415,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To reach the marrow in another world.
416,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But man within himself’s the greatest paradox;
417,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“A little animal,” as Voltaire says,"
418,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And yet a greater wonder than the sun,"
419,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or spangled firmament. That little one
420,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Can weigh and measure all the wheeling worlds,"
421,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But finds within his “five feet” home, a Sphinx"
422,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whose riddle he can never solve.
423,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“Thyself,”"
424,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The oracles of old bade men to know,"
425,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As if to mock their very impotence;
426,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And man, to know himself, for centuries"
427,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Has toiled and studied deep, in vain.--"
428,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Not man in flesh, for blest Hippocrates"
429,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Bright trimmed his lamp, and passed it down the line,"
430,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And each disciple adding of his oil,"
431,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It blazes now above the ghastly corpse,"
432,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till every fibre, every thread-like vein,"
433,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is known familiar as a city’s streets;
434,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The little muscle twitching back the lip,"
435,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Rejoicing in a name that spans the page.
436,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But man in mind, that is not seen nor felt,"
437,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But only knows he is, through consciousness."
438,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He sees an outside world, with all its throng"
439,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of busy people who care not for him,"
440,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And only few that know he does exist;
441,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And yet he feels the independent world
442,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is but effect produced upon himself,"
443,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Universe is packed within his mind,"
444,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,His mind within its little house of clay.
445,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,What is that mind? Has it a formal shape?
446,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And has it substance, color, weight, or force?"
447,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,What are the chains that bind it to the flesh?
448,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That never break except in death, though oft"
449,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The faculties are sent far out through space?
450,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Where is it placed, in head, or hands, or feet?"
451,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And can it have existence without place?
452,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And if a place, it must extension have,"
453,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And if extended, it is matter proven."
454,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Poor man! he has but mind to view mind with,"
455,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And might as well attempt to see the eye
456,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Without a mirror! True, faint consciousness"
457,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Holds up a little glass, wherein he sees"
458,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A few vague facts that cannot satisfy.
459,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For these, and their attendant laws, have fought"
460,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The mental champions of the world till now
461,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That each may deck them in his livery,"
462,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And claim them as his own discovery.
463,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
464,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Hedged in, man does not know that he is paled,"
465,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And struggles fiercely ’gainst the boundaries,"
466,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And strives to get a glimpse of those far realms
467,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of thought sublime, where his short wings would sink"
468,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With helpless fluttering, through the vast profound."
469,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon the coals of curiosity,"
470,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A writhing worm, he’s laid; and twists and turns,"
471,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To find, in vain, the healing salve of Truth."
472,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
473,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But grant that mind exists in fullest play:
474,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,How does it work and what its modes of thought?
475,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Here consciousness may act, and hold to view"
476,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A dim outline of powers, contraposed."
477,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In such a conflict, every one may seize"
478,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The doctrine suits him best. Hence different creeds--
479,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Desire battling reason, reason will,"
480,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And will the weathercock of motive’s wind;
481,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Motive the cringing slave of circumstance.
482,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And here Charybdis rises; no control
483,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Has man o’er circumstance, but circumstance"
484,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Begets the motive governing the will;
485,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then how can man be free? Yet some may say,"
486,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man can obey the motive, or can not."
487,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He can, but only when a stronger rules."
488,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That we without a motive never act,"
489,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I do declare, though in the face of Reid."
490,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That that is strongest which impels, a child"
491,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Might know, although Jouffroy exclaims,"
492,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,“You’re reasoning in a circle.” Let us place
493,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"An iron fragment ’twixt two magnet-bars,"
494,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,What one attracts is thereby stronger proved.
495,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or it may be the really weaker one,"
496,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But yet, because of nearness to the steel,"
497,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Possess a relatively greater force.
498,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And so of motives, howe’er trivial they,"
499,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The one that moves is strongest to the mind.
500,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To illustrate: Suppose I pare a peach;
501,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A friend near by me banteringly asserts
502,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That I can not refrain from eating it.
503,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Two motives now arise--the appetite,"
504,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And the desire to prove my self-control.
505,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I hesitate awhile, then laughing say,"
506,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,“I would not give the peach to prove you wrong.”
507,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But as my teeth press on it, pride springs up,"
508,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And bids me show that I am not the slave
509,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of appetite, and far away I hurl"
510,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The tinted, fragrant sphere."
511,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Was not each thought
512,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Spontaneous? Could I control their rise?
513,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,How perfectly absurd to talk of choice
514,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Between two motives offered to the mind!
515,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As if the motive was a horse we’d choose
516,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To pull our minds about. There is no choice
517,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Until the motive makes it; then we choose,"
518,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Not ’tween the motives, but the acts."
519,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If, then,"
520,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The spring of action is the motive’s power,"
521,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The motive being far beyond our sway,"
522,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Where is our freedom? But a fabled myth!
523,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And man but differs from a star in this,--"
524,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The laws of stars are fixed and definite,"
525,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And every movement there can be foretold;
526,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of man, no deed can be foreseen till done."
527,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,At most we can but form a general guess
528,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"How he will act, at such a time and place."
529,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Even if we knew the motives that would rise,"
530,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,We could not prophesy unless we knew
531,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Our subject’s frame of mind; for differently,"
532,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"On different minds, same motives often act."
533,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Hence, we can tell the conduct of a friend"
534,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"More surely than a stranger’s, since we know,"
535,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By long acquaintance, how his motives work."
536,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But should new motives rise, we cannot tell"
537,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Until experience gives us data new.
538,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Thus we will ride beside a friend alone,"
539,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And show to him our money without fear,"
540,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Because we know the motives--love for us,"
541,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Honor, and horror of disgraceful crime--"
542,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Are stronger with him than cupidity.
543,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But with a stranger we would feel unsafe;
544,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Nor would we trust our friend, were we alone"
545,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon an island, wrecked, and without food,"
546,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And saw his eye with hunger glare, and heard"
547,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The famished motive whispering to him, “Kill!”"
548,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If he were free, would we feel slightest fear?"
549,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For all his soul would shudder from the deed,"
550,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And never motive could impel such crime.
551,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
552,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Upon this principal all law is made;
553,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For were man free he could not be controlled,"
554,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And all compliance would be his caprice.
555,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But since he is the tyrant-motive’s slave,"
556,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The law to govern motive only seeks
557,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And builds its sanction on the base of pain,"
558,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As motive strongest in the human heart.
559,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It only falls below perfection’s height,"
560,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because there are exceptions to the rule;
561,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When hate and passion, lust and greed of gold,"
562,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Prove stronger than the fear of distant pain.
563,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And could the law know fully every heart,"
564,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And vary sanction, there would be no crime."
565,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
566,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But law itself, and the obeying world,"
567,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Are proofs against the grosser form of Fate:
568,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That all is preordained, nor can be changed."
569,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,All human life is vacillating life;
570,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We make our plans each day, then alter them."
571,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We form resolves one hour that break the next,"
572,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And no one dares assert that he will act,"
573,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon the morrow, in a certain way;"
574,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But cries, it all depends on circumstance."
575,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And this is strange, that while we cannot change"
576,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Our lives one tittle by our own free will,"
577,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We help, each day, to change our neighbor’s course;"
578,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And he assists the motives changing ours.
579,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For all relations to our fellow-men,"
580,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are powers that form our lives, in spite of us."
581,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But we may change our motives, often do,"
582,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By changing place, or circumstance of life,"
583,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By hearing, reading, or reflective thought;"
584,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet are these very things from motives done,"
585,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And motives mocking all our vain commands.
586,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"One motive made the object of an act,"
587,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Another rises subject of the act;
588,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And to the final motive we can never reach.
589,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
590,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The world’s a self-adjusting, vast machine,"
591,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whose human comparts cannot guide themselves;
592,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And each is but a puppet to the whole,"
593,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet adds its mite towards its government;
594,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Here, in this motive circle, lies all Fate."
595,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Our fellow-men with motives furnish us,"
596,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,While we contribute to their motive fund.
597,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The real power, hidden deep within,"
598,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Escapes the eye of careless consciousness;
599,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who proudly tells us we are action’s cause.
600,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon this error men, mistaken, raise"
601,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The edifice of law in all its forms;
602,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That yet performs its varied functions well,"
603,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Because it offers motives that restrain,"
604,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till stronger overcome, and crime ensues."
605,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The motive gibbet lifts its warning arms;
606,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The pillory gapes its scolloped lips for necks;
607,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The lash grows stiff with blood and shreds of flesh;
608,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The treadmill yields beneath the wearied feet;
609,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And Sabbath after Sabbath preachers tell
610,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of judgment, and of awful Hell, and Heaven;"
611,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All these, to stronger make, than lust of sin."
612,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And yet, to lead my reasoning to its end,"
613,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I find a chaos of absurdity.
614,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If I am by an unruled motive driven,"
615,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Why act at all? Why passive not recline
616,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon the lap of destiny, and wait her arms?"
617,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Why struggle to acquire means of life,"
618,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,When Fate must fill our mouths or let us die?
619,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Why go not naked forth into the world,"
620,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And trust to Fate for clothes? Why spring aside
621,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From falling weight, or flee a burning house,"
622,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or fight with instinct strength the clasp of waves?
623,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because we cannot help it; every act
624,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Behind it has a motive, whose command"
625,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We, willing or unwilling, must obey."
626,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
627,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Law governs motives, motives create law;"
628,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Between the reflex action man is placed,"
629,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The helpless shuttlecock of unjust Fate!
630,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Now passive driven to commit a crime,"
631,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Then by the driver laid upon the rack;
632,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A Zeno’s slave, compelled by Fate to steal,"
633,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And then compelled by Fate to bear the lash!
634,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
635,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,What gross injustice is the rule of life!
636,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A sentient being made without a will,"
637,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And placed a cat’s-paw in the hands of Fate,"
638,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who rakes the moral embers for a sin,"
639,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That, found, must burn the helpless one alone."
640,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All right and wrong, and whate’er makes man man,"
641,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are gone, and language is half obsolete;"
642,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,No need of words to tell of moral worth
643,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Existing not, nor e’en conceivable;"
644,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No words of blame or commendation, given"
645,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,According to the intention of a deed;
646,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No words of cheer or comfort, to incite,"
647,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For man must act without our useless tongues;
648,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No words of prayer, if Fate supplies our wants;"
649,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No words of prayer, if Fate locks up her store;"
650,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No words of love, for fondest love were loathed"
651,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If fanned by Fate to flame. No words of hate,"
652,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For all forgive a wrong when helpless done;
653,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The buds that bloom upon the desert heart
654,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Lose all their sweetness when they’re forced to grow;
655,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All pleasure’s marred because it is not earned,"
656,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And pain more painful since ’tis undeserved.
657,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
658,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man falling from his high estate, becomes"
659,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A brute with keener sensibilities;
660,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Endowed with mind, upon whose plastic face"
661,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Fate writes its batch of lies; poor man believes,"
662,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And prates of moral agency, and cants"
663,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of good _he_ does, and evil that _he_ shuns."
664,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With blind content, he rests in false belief,"
665,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And happy thus escapes the mental rack--
666,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The consciousness of what he really is.
667,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
668,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And yet why false belief? The world believes,"
669,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And acting, moves in general harmony;"
670,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Could harmony from such an error flow?
671,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Would all believe, would not some one"
672,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Have doubted by his works as well as faith?
673,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The veriest skeptic walks the earth to-day,"
674,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As if he held the seal of freest will,"
675,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And shapes its course, and judges all mankind"
676,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,By freedom’s rule.
677,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Then may not that be true
678,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Which most believe, and those who doubt profess"
679,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In every act; as that which few believe
680,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And to which none conform?
681,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Two paths I see,"
682,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"One marked Free-Will, the other Fate. The first,"
683,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Extending far as human thought can reach,"
684,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Through lovely meads with sweetest flowers, and fruits"
685,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of actions clearly shown as right and wrong,"
686,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because of choice ’twixt the two; of laws
687,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,With sanction suiting agents who are free;
688,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of courts acquitting the insane of crime,"
689,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of crime made crime, alone, when done as crime,"
690,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of judgment passed by public sentiment
691,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,On action in the ratio of liberty.
692,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Delightful view; but seek an entrance there--
693,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The towering bars of unruled motive stand
694,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Before the path, and none can overleap."
695,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
696,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The field of Fate lies open; nothing bars
697,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Our progress there. A thousand different ways
698,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The path diverges. Every by-path leads
699,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To some foul pit or bottomless abyss.
700,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Along each side are strewed the whitening bones
701,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of venturous pilgrims, lost amid its snares,"
702,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some broken on the rocks of gross decree,"
703,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who hold an unchanged destiny from birth;
704,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who will not take a medicine if sick,"
705,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who cant of “To be, will be,” and the time"
706,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Unalterably set to each man’s life.
707,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some stranded on the finer form of Fate,"
708,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who say it works by means. Hence they believe
709,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In using all preventives to disease,"
710,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In going boating in a rubber belt,"
711,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In placing Franklin rods upon a house,"
712,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In preaching, and in praying men repent."
713,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"These, when one dies, cry out, “It was his time.”"
714,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or if he should recover, “It was not.”"
715,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Their fate is always ex post facto fate,"
716,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And knowing not the future, they abide"
717,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The issue of events, and then confirm"
718,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Their dogged dogmas.
719,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Still another class,"
720,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Though fewer far in numbers, perish here."
721,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,These are the sophists; men who deeply dive
722,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Beneath the surface of effect, and trace"
723,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Our actions to their source. They find that man,"
724,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Made in the glorious image of his God,"
725,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is not an independent cause, but works"
726,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,From motive causes out of his control.
727,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,They find that every mental act must flow
728,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From outside source, then fearlessly ascend"
729,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The chain of being to a height divine,"
730,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And dare to fetter the Eternal mind,"
731,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And throw their bonds around Omnipotence.
732,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As well a spider in an eagle’s nest
733,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Might, from his hidden web among the twigs,"
734,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Attempt to throw his little gluey thread
735,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Around the mottled wing, whose muscled strength"
736,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Beats hurried vacuums in the ocean’s spray,"
737,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or circling upward, parts the thunder-cloud,"
738,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And bursts above; and shaking off the mists,"
739,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With rigid feathers bright as burnished steel,"
740,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Floats proudly through the tranquil air.
741,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Which realm
742,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Shall now be mine, Free-Will or Fate? The one"
743,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Stands open wide, but all in ruin ends;"
744,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The other, fair if once within the pale;"
745,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But how to scale the barriers none can tell.
746,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Bah! all is doubt. I’ll leave the mystic paths
747,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Where, on each side, are ranged the phantom shapes"
748,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of disputants, alive and dead, who fight,"
749,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With foolish zeal, o’er myths intangible;"
750,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,When each one cries “Eureka!” for his creed.
751,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That scarcely lives a day, then yields its place."
752,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A Roman ’gainst a Roman, Greek to Greek,"
753,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A zealous Omar with an Ali paired;
754,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A saintly Pharisee in hot dispute
755,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,With Sadducees. Along th’ illustrious rows
756,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of lesser lights, who advocate the creeds"
757,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of their respective masters, we descend"
758,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To later days and see Titanic minds
759,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Exert their giant strength to reach the truth,"
760,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And, baffled, fall. Locke, ever elsewhere clear,"
761,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Here mystified Spinoza’s dizzy wing
762,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,O’erweighted by his strange “imperium;”
763,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Hobbes, with his new intrinsic liberty;"
764,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And Belsham’s quaint reduction too absurd;
765,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“Sufficient reason,” reared in Leibnitz’s strength;"
766,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Reid, Collins, Edwards, Tappan, Priestley, Clarke,"
767,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,All push each other from the door of Truth.
768,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
769,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"None ever have, nor ever will, on earth,"
770,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Reach truth of theory concerning Fate.
771,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It stands as whole from every touch of man
772,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As ocean’s broad blue scroll, whose rubber waves"
773,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Erase the furrows of the plowing keels.
774,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
775,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then, careless whether man be king or slave,"
776,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I’ll take his actions, whether free or not,"
777,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And trace them to their sources. Deep the dive,"
778,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But, throwing off the buoys of Charity"
779,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And Faith, and all the prejudice of life,"
780,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I grasp the lead of Doubt, and downward sink"
781,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Into the cesspool of the human heart,"
782,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To find the fount, that to the surface casts"
783,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A thousand bubbles of such varied hues:
784,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The pale white bubble of hypocrisy,"
785,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The murky bubble of revenge and hate,"
786,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The frail gilt bubble of ambition’s hope,"
787,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The rainbow bubble of sweet love in youth,"
788,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The dull slime bubble of a sensual lust,"
789,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The crystal bubble of true charity!
790,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Instead of analyzing every fact
791,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of moral nature, searching for its source,"
792,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I’ll name a source most probable, and try"
793,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The facts upon it; if they fit, confirm,"
794,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If not, reject. With Hobbes and Paley then"
795,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I join; and here avow that all mankind
796,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Have but one source of action--Love of self--
797,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet not self-love as understands the world,"
798,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For that’s a name for error shown by few;
799,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But natural instinct that impels all men
800,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To give self pleasure, and to save it pain;"
801,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For pain and pleasure are Life’s only modes--
802,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No neutral state--we suffer, or enjoy;"
803,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And every action’s linked with one of these.
804,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We cannot act without a consciousness,"
805,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A consciousness of pleasure or of pain,"
806,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The very automatic workings of our frames
807,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are pleasures, unmarked from their constancy;"
808,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But if impeded, they produce a pain."
809,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"This instinct, teaching us to pleasure seek,"
810,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And pain avoid, none ever disobey;"
811,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For be their conduct what it may, a crime"
812,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or virtue, greed or pure benevolence,"
813,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To find the greatest pleasure is their aim.
814,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Nay, start not, critic, but attend the proofs."
815,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A man exists within himself alone,"
816,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Himself, or he would lose identity."
817,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To him the world exists but by effects
818,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Upon himself. His actions toward it then
819,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Bear reference to himself. He cannot act
820,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Without affecting self. His nature’s law
821,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Demands that self be dealt with pleasantly.
822,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
823,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"There is no pain or pleasure in the world,"
824,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But as he feels th’ reality in self,"
825,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or fancies it by signs in other men.
826,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"This fancied pain is never _real_ pain,"
827,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But yields a _real_ reflex. Others’ pain
828,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is never pain to us, unless we know"
829,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It does exist. Within a hundred yards
830,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A neighbor dies, in agony intense,"
831,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And yet we feel no slightest trace of pain,"
832,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Unless informed thereof. ’Tis only when we know,"
833,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And therefore are affected, that we feel."
834,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
835,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The modes of pain and pleasure are then two,"
836,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A real and a fancied one. The first acute,"
837,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In ratio of our sensibilities;
838,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The last in ratio of our image-power.
839,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"These gifts in different men unequal are,"
840,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And hence life’s varied phases. One may deem
841,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A real pain far greater than a pain
842,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In fancy formed, from others’ sufferings;"
843,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He eats alone, and drives the starving off."
844,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Another’s fancy paints more vividly,"
845,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And he endures keen hunger to supply
846,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The poor with food. And so of pleasure too,--"
847,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And this moves all to shun the greatest pain,"
848,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And find the greatest pleasure.
849,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Different minds,"
850,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And each at different times of life, possess"
851,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A different standard of this highest good.
852,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The swaddled infant wails for its own food,"
853,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because its highest pleasure is alone in sense;
854,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The child will from its playmate hide a cake
855,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Until it learns that praise for sharing it
856,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Gives greater pleasure than the sweetened taste;
857,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"One boy at school proves insubordinate,"
858,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,His schoolmates’ praise he deems his highest good;
859,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Another studies well, because he values more"
860,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A parent’s smile. The murderer with his knife,"
861,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The maiden praying in her purity,"
862,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The miser dying over hoards of gold,"
863,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The widow casting thither her two mites,"
864,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A white-veil bending o’er the dying couch,"
865,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A stained beauty floating through the waltz,"
866,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The preacher’s zeal, the gambler’s eager zest;"
867,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All have one motive, greatest good to self!"
868,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
869,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The tender stop their ears, and cry aloud:"
870,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,“What! do you dare assert the gambler seeks
871,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,With hellish zeal the faintest shade of good?
872,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That he is holy as the Man of God?”
873,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By no means, yet he seeks his good the same."
874,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Not good as you’ve been taught to apprehend,"
875,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But good, the greatest to his frame of mind."
876,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Do not exclaim that good is always good,"
877,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And never differs from itself. Anon
878,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We’ll speak of abstract truths, if such there be"
879,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That good and pleasure are synonymous
880,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"At times of action, is most surely plain;"
881,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For pleasure’s but the consciousness of good,"
882,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or satisfaction of our tendencies.
883,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If all the gambler’s soul is bent on gain,"
884,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Then at the moment gain is greatest good;
885,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But should you reason with him, and explain"
886,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Another life, and make it really seem"
887,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To him the best, he straight would change his course."
888,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
889,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“But,” cries my friend, “the preacher, if he’s true,"
890,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Must labor, not for self, but others’ good;"
891,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And in proportion as the self’s forgot,"
892,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And others cared for, does his conduct rise.”"
893,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
894,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But he can not, if conscious, forget self,"
895,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For everything he does is felt within;
896,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But deeds for others’ good a pleasure give;
897,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If done in pain to self, the pleasure’s more."
898,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To gain the pleasure, self is put to pain,"
899,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Just as a vesication brings relief.
900,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,If he refused to undergo the pain
901,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Remorse would double it.
902,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Among his flock
903,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some one is sick; to visit him is right,"
904,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And done, affords a pleasure. Sweeter far"
905,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That pleasure, if he walks through snow and ice,"
906,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,At duty’s call!
907,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
908,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Sublime self-sacrifice,"
909,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of which men prate, is nothing more nor less"
910,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Than base self-worship. Little pain endured
911,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,T’ avoid a great; a smaller pleasure lost
912,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To gain a larger!
913,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
914,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All the preacher’s words,"
915,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That burn or die upon the stolid ear,"
916,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are spoken from this motive, good to self."
917,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,You stare; but it is true. Why does he preach?
918,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To save men’s souls?--Why does he try to save?
919,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because he loves his fellow-men? Not so.
920,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His love for them but to the pleasure adds,"
921,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Which duty done confers; but all his work
922,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Must be with reference to himself alone,"
923,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Though cunning self the real motive hides,"
924,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And leaves his broad philanthropy and love
925,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To claim the merit. Let a score of men,"
926,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The blackest sinners, die. He knows it not,"
927,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And feels no pang; but if he is informed,"
928,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He suffers reflex pain. And if his charge,"
929,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Remorseful tortures for unfaithfulness.
930,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And only is the state of souls to him
931,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of interest, as they are known. When known,"
932,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It is a source of pleasure or of pain
933,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Which all his labor is to gain or shun.
934,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
935,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“This difference then,” says one, “between men’s lives;"
936,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some live for present, some for future good."
937,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The sensual care for self on earth alone,"
938,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The mystic cares for self beyond the grave.”
939,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
940,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Both love a present self, in present time."
941,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,They differ in their notions of its good.
942,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The stern ascetic, with his shirt of hair,"
943,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His bleeding penitential knees, his fasts"
944,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To almost death, his soul-exhausting prayers,"
945,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is seeking, cries the world, good after death."
946,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And yet his course of life is that alone
947,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Which could yield pleasure in his state of mind.
948,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He suffers, it is true, but hope of Heaven"
949,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Thus rendered sure, as much a present good"
950,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is, as the food that feasts the epicure."
951,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The contemplation of his future home,"
952,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Which he is thus securing, is a balm"
953,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That heals his stripes, and sweetens all their pain."
954,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The penance blows upon his blood-wealed breast
955,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Are bliss compared to lashes of remorse.
956,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So for the greater good, the hope of Heaven,"
957,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He undergoes “the trivial pain of flesh.”
958,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The epicure cares not a fig for Heaven,"
959,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But finds his greatest good in pleasing sense.
960,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And so the man who gives his wealth away
961,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is just as selfish as the money-slave
962,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who grinds out life amid his dusty bags.
963,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,They both seek happiness with equal zest:
964,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The one finds pleasure in the many thanks
965,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of those receiving, or the public’s praise,"
966,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or if concealed, in consciousness of right;"
967,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The other in the consciousness of wealth.
968,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
969,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If all men act from motives just the same,"
970,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Where is the right and wrong? In the effect?
971,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The quality of actions must be judged
972,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From their intent, and not their consequence."
973,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If two men matches light for their cigars,"
974,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And from one careless dropped, a house is burned,"
975,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is he that dropped it guiltier of crime
976,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Than he whose match went out? Most surely no!
977,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then is the miser blameless, though he turn"
978,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The helpless orphan freezing from his door;
979,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And Dives should not be commended more,"
980,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Though all his goods to feed the poor he gives.
981,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
982,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,How then shall we determine quality
983,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of actions, when their sources are the same,"
984,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And their effects possess no quality?
985,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Two dead men lie in blood beside the way,"
986,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The one shot by a friend, an accident;"
987,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The other murdered for his gold. ’Tis plain
988,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No wrong lies in th’ effects, for both are ’like;"
989,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And of the agents, he of accident"
990,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Had no intent, and therefore did no wrong."
991,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The other killed to satisfy the self,"
992,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A motive founding all the Christian work,"
993,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And right if that is right. The wrong
994,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then lies between the motive and effect,"
995,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And must exist in the effecting means.
996,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet how within the means is wrong proved wrong?
997,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Jouffroy would say, because a disregard"
998,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of others’ rights; for here he places good,"
999,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,When classifying Nature’s moral facts.
1000,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He makes the child first serve flesh self,"
1001,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then moral self, and last to others’ good"
1002,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Ascend, and general order. What a myth!"
1003,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As if man thought of others, save effect"
1004,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,From them upon himself. But order gives
1005,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A greater good to self; therefore he joins
1006,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His strength to others, creates laws that bind"
1007,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Himself and them, and produce harmony."
1008,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He thus surrenders minor good of self,"
1009,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To gain a greater. This is all the need
1010,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He has of order, though Jouffroy asserts"
1011,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That order universal is the Good.
1012,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet still he says that private good of each
1013,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is but a fragment of the absolute,"
1014,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And that regard for every being’s rights
1015,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is binding as the universal law!
1016,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1017,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Regard for others’ rights indeed, when men"
1018,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Unharmed agree to hang a man for crime!
1019,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Not for the crime--that’s past; but to prevent
1020,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A second crime, which crime alone exists"
1021,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In apprehensive fancy. Thus for wrong
1022,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That’s but forethought, they do a real wrong."
1023,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To save their rights from harm they fear may come.
1024,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They strip a fellow-man of actual right,"
1025,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And highest, right of life; then dare to call"
1026,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Their action pure, divinely just, and good,"
1027,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And all the farce of empty names.
1028,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,They make
1029,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of gross injustice individual,"
1030,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A flimsy justice, for mankind at large,"
1031,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And cry, Let it be done, though Heaven fall!"
1032,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As if a whole could differ from its parts,"
1033,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or right be made from wrong. Yet some may say
1034,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That one is sacrificed for many’s good,"
1035,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or hung that many may avoid his fate;
1036,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And that his crime deserved what he received.
1037,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1038,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But law must value every man alike,"
1039,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And cannot save one man, or thousand men,"
1040,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From future evil, only possible,"
1041,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By greatest evil to another man,"
1042,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In its own view of justice. Nor can crime
1043,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Meet punishment, at mortal hands, by right,"
1044,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For murder’s murder, done by one or twelve,"
1045,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And legal murder’s done in colder blood,"
1046,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whose stains are chalked by vain authority.
1047,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Authority! the child of numbers and self-love!
1048,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Regard for rights of things, indeed, when beasts"
1049,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And birds must yield their right of life that man
1050,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"May please his right of taste. When, during Lent,"
1051,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The holy-days of fasting and of prayer,"
1052,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The scaly victims crowd the Bishop’s board,"
1053,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Their flesh unfleshed by Conscience’ pliant rule,"
1054,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Our palates must be for a moment pleased,"
1055,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Though costing something agonies of death;
1056,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And worse than robbers, what we cannot give,"
1057,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,We dare to take.
1058,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They have no souls, say you?"
1059,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Nor after death exist?
1060,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That nothing’s lost,"
1061,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Philosophy maintains as axiom truth.
1062,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"An object disappears, but somewhere lives"
1063,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In other form. The water-pool to mist
1064,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is changed, the powder into flame and smoke."
1065,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"My pointer dies, his body, decomposed,"
1066,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The air, the soil, and vegetation feeds;"
1067,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet still exists, although disintegrate."
1068,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For there was something, while the pointer lived,"
1069,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That was not body, but that governed it,"
1070,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A spirit, essence, call it what you will,"
1071,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A something seen but through phenomena,"
1072,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And by them proved most clearly to exist.
1073,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A something, not the feet that made them run,"
1074,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A something, not the eyes, but knew they saw,"
1075,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A something, without which the eyes could see"
1076,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As much as glasses can without the eye,"
1077,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The something, “Carlo” named, that knew the name."
1078,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The pointer dies, and we dissect the flesh."
1079,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All there, none missing, to the tiniest nerve;"
1080,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet something’s gone, the more important part,"
1081,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And can you say that it has ceased to be,"
1082,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When th’ flesh, inferior to it, still exists?"
1083,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The spirit, if existent, must be whole,"
1084,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Nor can be parted till material proven.
1085,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That Carlo lives, seems plain as I shall live;"
1086,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He lived for self, and so did I; we fare"
1087,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Alike in after-life, we differ here"
1088,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In consciousness of immortality.
1089,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But I digress.
1090,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Where is the right and wrong?
1091,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"This is the Gordian knot no sword can cut,"
1092,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All sages of the world, with wisdom-teeth,"
1093,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Have gnawed this file without the least effect.
1094,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The thousand savants of old Greece and Rome
1095,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Proclaimed a thousand theories of good,"
1096,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That each, successive, proud devoid of truth."
1097,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A myriad moderns have advanced their views,"
1098,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Each gained a few disciples, who avowed their truth,"
1099,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And each, by some one else, been proven wrong."
1100,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A Bentham marches out utility,"
1101,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A moral test from benefit or harm.
1102,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As if the good depended on effect,"
1103,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And good would not be good, though universe"
1104,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In all its phases found no use! And Price
1105,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Parades his “reason,” with its simple good;"
1106,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who’d rather give the question up, than err,"
1107,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And so declares it cannot be defined.
1108,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then Wollaston declares that good is truth,"
1109,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Which no one doubts, far as it goes; it goes"
1110,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Toward good, as far as truth, its attribute;"
1111,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Beyond, it cannot reach. And Montesquieu"
1112,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And Clarke, relation’s order preach; a rule"
1113,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That makes the growing grain, or falling shower,"
1114,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A moral agent, capable of good."
1115,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then Wolf and Malebranche perfection see,"
1116,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And therefore good, in God; but their sight fails,"
1117,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And God may mirror good, but man’s weak eyes"
1118,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Ne’er see it. Adam Smith, with “sentiment”"
1119,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Proceeds to dress a thought, and call it, good;"
1120,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And makes the abstract of a Universe
1121,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Arise from puling human sympathy.
1122,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The largest concourse follow Hutcheson,"
1123,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Although the greater part ne’er heard of him.
1124,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The world at large believes in moral sense;
1125,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,They call it conscience! Oh the precious word!
1126,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Though stretched and warped, they almost deify,"
1127,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And term it man’s tribunal in his breast,"
1128,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Where he may judge his actions, right or wrong."
1129,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,What nonsense! Conscience is but consciousness
1130,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of soul, and idea of its good. We form"
1131,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"This idea from regard of fellow-men,"
1132,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Association, and from thought. We find"
1133,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Sometimes the good of soul conflicts with flesh,"
1134,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And when we know the soul above the flesh,"
1135,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,We yield to that the preference. Hence arise
1136,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The foolish notions of self disregard.
1137,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The savage does not know he has a soul,"
1138,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And therefore has no conscience. He can steal
1139,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Without remorse. But when he learns of soul,"
1140,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He finds it has a good, and by this test"
1141,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Tries moral actions, are they good for soul?"
1142,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And this is conscience.
1143,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet is conscience changed
1144,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,By circumstance. The Hindoo mother tears
1145,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The helpless infant from her trickling breast,"
1146,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To feed the crocodile, and save her soul;"
1147,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,She’s happier in its conscience-murdered wail
1148,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Than in its gleeful prattle on her knee.
1149,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And daily we see one commit a deed
1150,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Without a pang, another dare not do."
1151,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,If conscience may be warped but one degree
1152,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By plain Sorites, it may be reversed,"
1153,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And only prove an interested thought.
1154,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1155,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To abstract good no man has found the key,"
1156,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Though in the various forms of concrete good
1157,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We see the similars, and from these frame"
1158,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A good that serves the purposes of life.
1159,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We pass it as we do the concept, “Man,”"
1160,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But never ope to count the attributes.
1161,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Our purest right is but approximate
1162,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To this vague abstract idea, how obtained,"
1163,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,We know not. Plato says ’tis memory
1164,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of previous life. Perhaps! ’Tis very dim
1165,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In this; and yet it rocks the cradle world
1166,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As strongly as the baby man can bear
1167,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And so of truth, or aught abstract, we know"
1168,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of such existence somewhere, that is all."
1169,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“But we,” cries one, “do hold some abstract truth,"
1170,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In perfect form. The truth of science’ laws,"
1171,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The truths of numbers, each are perfect truths.”"
1172,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The truths of science are hypotheses,"
1173,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And only true as far as they explain.
1174,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But perfect truth must save all facts,"
1175,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That ever rose or possibly can rise.
1176,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,“The priest of Nature” thought he held the truth
1177,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When throughout space he tracked the motes of light,"
1178,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And ground the sunbeams into dazzling dust.
1179,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Our quivering waves through subtle ether flash,"
1180,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And drown Sir Isaac’s atoms in a flood
1181,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of glorious truth; till some new fact shall rise
1182,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To give our truth the lie, and cause a change"
1183,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of theory.
1184,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Our numbers no truth have,"
1185,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or but a shadow, cast on Earth by truth"
1186,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Existent in some unknown world. We make
1187,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Our little numbers fit the shadow’s line
1188,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As best they can, and boast eternal truth!"
1189,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet take a simple form of numbers, “two,”"
1190,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We cannot have a perfect thought of this,"
1191,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Because the mind directly asks, two what?"
1192,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,’Tis not enough chameleon to feed
1193,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"On empty air. Two units, we reply"
1194,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then what is meant by unity? An “One,”--"
1195,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The mind can only cognize o-n-e,"
1196,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Which makes three units and not one.
1197,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The mind
1198,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Must have a concrete object to adjust
1199,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The abstract on, before it comprehends."
1200,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But two concretes are never two, because"
1201,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,They never can be proved exactly ’like.
1202,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To illustrate: suppose two ivory balls,"
1203,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of finest mold, and equal weight, precise"
1204,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As hair-hung scales, arranged most delicate,"
1205,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Can prove; yet they can not be shown
1206,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To differ, not the trillionth of a grain;"
1207,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or if they could, they may in density"
1208,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Be unlike; then to equal weight, one must"
1209,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Be larger by the trillionth of an inch.
1210,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Even if alike in density and weight,"
1211,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,No one will dare assert that they possess
1212,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A perfect similarity in all.
1213,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The abstract two is twice as much as one,"
1214,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But our two balls unlike, perforce must be"
1215,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Greater or less than two of either one;
1216,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But two of one, the same can never be"
1217,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"On poor, imperfect Earth. Thus all our twos"
1218,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Fall, in some measure, short of concept two."
1219,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And if we paint the concept to the eye,"
1220,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The figure 2 of finest stereotype,"
1221,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Beneath the microscope imperfect shows.
1222,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And so our perfect numbers, wisdom’s boast,"
1223,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are faint, uncertain shadows in the mind,"
1224,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That we can never picture to the eye,"
1225,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Nor truthfully apply to anything.
1226,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We use a ragged, ill-drawn substitute,"
1227,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That answers all the purposes of life.
1228,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The truths of mathematics, so sublime,"
1229,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are never true to us, concretely known;"
1230,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And in the abstract so concealed are they,"
1231,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,No man can swear he has their perfect form.
1232,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,We can’t conceive a line without some breadth--
1233,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The perfect line possesses length alone;
1234,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Earth never saw a pure right-angle drawn,"
1235,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Pythag’ras cannot prove his theorem,"
1236,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The finest quadrant is but nearest truth,"
1237,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The closest measures but approximate,"
1238,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And all from Sanconiathon to Pierce,"
1239,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With grandest soaring into Number’s realms,"
1240,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Have only fluttered feebly o’er the ground,"
1241,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Their heaven-strong wings by feebling matter tied.
1242,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1243,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man is a pris’ner, but the prison walls"
1244,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Are very vast; so vast the universe
1245,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Lies, like a mote, within their mighty scope."
1246,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Most are content to grovel on the earth,"
1247,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some rise a little way, and sink again;"
1248,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And some, on noble wing, soar to the bounds,"
1249,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And eager beat the bars. Beyond these walls
1250,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The abstract lies, and oft the straggling rays,"
1251,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Through crevices and chinks, stray to our jail;"
1252,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And these we fondly hug as truth.
1253,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Poor man!
1254,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The glimpses of the great Beyond have roused,"
1255,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For centuries, his curious soul to flight."
1256,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With eagle eye fixed on the distant goal,"
1257,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He cleaves his way, till dashed against the walls;"
1258,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some fall with bruiséd wing again to Earth,"
1259,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And some cling bravely there, so eager they"
1260,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To reach the untouched prize, and so intent"
1261,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Their gaze upon its light, they notice not"
1262,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The bounds, till Hamilton, with wary eye,"
1263,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Discovers the Eternal bounding line,"
1264,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And sadly shows its hopeless fixity.
1265,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1266,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But man on Earth I love to ridicule,"
1267,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A little clod of sordid selfishness!
1268,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I’ll take his mental acts of every kind
1269,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And see how self originates them all;
1270,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I’ll follow Stewart, since he classifies"
1271,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With shrewd discretion, though his reasoning err,"
1272,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He places first the appetites; and these
1273,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Perforce are selfish, as our self alone"
1274,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Must feel and suffer with our wants. Our food
1275,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Tastes good alone to us. The richest feast,"
1276,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In others’ mouths, could never satisfy"
1277,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Our appetite for food; self must be fed.
1278,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Desires are next; and that of knowledge, first,"
1279,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is proven selfish, by his quoted line"
1280,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,From Cicero--that “knowledge is the food
1281,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of mind”--and food is ever sought for self.
1282,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Desire of social intercourse with men,"
1283,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From thought that it will better self, proceeds."
1284,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man’s state is friendly, not a state of war,"
1285,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For instinct teaches him society
1286,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Will offer many benefits to self;
1287,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And only when he has a cause to fear
1288,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That self will suffer, does he learn to war."
1289,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Desire to gain esteem, is self in search"
1290,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of approbation; like the appetite,"
1291,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The end pursued affects alone the self.
1292,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And lastly Stewart boasts posthumous fame,"
1293,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When self, as sacrificed, can seek no good."
1294,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To prove the motive is a selfish good,"
1295,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I’ll not assert enjoyment after life,"
1296,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But say, the pleasure of the millions’ praise,"
1297,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Anticipated in the present thought,"
1298,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And intense consciousness of heroism,"
1299,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Far more than compensates the pangs of death.
1300,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A Curtius leaping down the dread abyss,"
1301,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Enjoys his fame enough, before he strikes,"
1302,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To pay for every pain of mangling death.
1303,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Affections next adorn the moral page.
1304,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"At that of kindred, mothers cry aloud:"
1305,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,“For shame! for shame! do you pretend to say
1306,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I love my child with any thought of self?
1307,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When I would lay my arm upon the block,"
1308,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And have it severed for his slightest good!”
1309,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I’ll square your love by Reason’s rigid rule,"
1310,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And test its source. Why do you love him so?
1311,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For benefit he has conferred, or may?"
1312,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No, as the helpless babe, demanding care,"
1313,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You love him most. Your love is instinct then,"
1314,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And like the cow her calf, you love your child;"
1315,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That you may care for him, before self moves."
1316,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then do you love him always just the same,"
1317,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,When rude and bad as when obedient?
1318,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But I’ll dissect your love, and take away"
1319,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Each part affecting self; and see what’s left.
1320,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He now has grown beyond your instinct love;
1321,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You love him, first, because he is your son,"
1322,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And you would suffer blame, if you did not;"
1323,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You love him, too, because he does reflect"
1324,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A credit on yourself. You feel assured
1325,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That others thinking well of him, think well"
1326,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of you. Because it flatters all your pride
1327,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To think so fine a life is part of yours;
1328,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because his high opinion of your worth
1329,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Evokes a meet return; because you look
1330,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Into the future, and see honors bright"
1331,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Awaiting you through him; because you feel
1332,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The world is praising you for loving him,"
1333,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And would condemn you, did you not. And last,"
1334,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You feel the pleasure deep of self-esteem,"
1335,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because you fill the public’s and your own
1336,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Romantic ideas of a mother’s love.
1337,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1338,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Let each component part be now destroyed,"
1339,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And see if still you love him. As a man,"
1340,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He plunges into vice of vilest kinds;
1341,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His bright reflections on yourself are gone,"
1342,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And people think the worse of you, for him;"
1343,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You never smile, but frown, upon him now,"
1344,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But still you love him dearly! To his vice
1345,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He adds a crime, a foul and blasting crime;"
1346,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Your pride is gone, you feel a bitter shame,"
1347,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A score of opposites to love creep in;
1348,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A righteous anger at his foolish sins,"
1349,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A just contempt for nature, weak as his;"
1350,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But yet you love him fondly, for the world"
1351,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is lauding you for “mother’s holy love”;
1352,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And you delight its clinging strength to show,"
1353,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You gain in public credit by your woes,"
1354,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And get the soothing martyr’s sympathy.
1355,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But let him still grow worse, and sink so low,"
1356,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That people say you are disgraced through him,"
1357,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Your warmest friends will not acquaintance own,"
1358,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Your love for such an object’s ridiculed,"
1359,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And gains respect from none. Your only chance
1360,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is to disown him. How you loud proclaim,"
1361,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,“He’s not my child but by the accident
1362,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of birth!”
1363,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Do yet you love him in your heart?
1364,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"This then because you think yourself so good,"
1365,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So heaven-like, for loving him disgraced,"
1366,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,You go to see him in the shameful jail;
1367,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He spits upon, and beats you from his cell,"
1368,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And tells you that he hates your very name.
1369,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Now all your love is gone, except the glow"
1370,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of pity for him chained to dungeon floor;
1371,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But he’s released, and deeper goes in crime;"
1372,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then, lastly, Pity yields. Your heart is stone!"
1373,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1374,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But love was only touched in selfish part,"
1375,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet should you still deny your love is self’s;
1376,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of several children, do you not love most"
1377,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The one whose conduct pleases most yourself?
1378,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But love, unselfish, never could be moved"
1379,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,By anything affecting self alone.
1380,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1381,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The throbbing hearts of lovers beat for self,"
1382,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And this I’ll prove, though Pyramus may vow"
1383,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He has no thought but Thisbe.
1384,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Take away
1385,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Love’s sensual part, which is an appetite,"
1386,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And therefore selfish, by its Nature’s law;"
1387,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And what remains is, first, a slight conceit"
1388,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"At our discernment in the choice we’ve made,"
1389,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And then a pride that we have won the prize;
1390,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A pride, that some one thinks we are the best;"
1391,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A pleasure in her presence, too, we feel,"
1392,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because in every look she manifests
1393,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Her preference for us. This is flattering
1394,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Beyond all else that we have ever known.
1395,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A friend may raise our self-esteem, indeed,"
1396,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By showing constantly his own esteem,"
1397,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But never can man’s vanity receive
1398,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A higher tribute than a woman’s love!
1399,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"This tribute, we, of course, reciprocate,"
1400,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And when together, we increase self-love"
1401,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,By mutual words expressing our regard.
1402,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet when our love is deepest, if we find"
1403,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Our Self is not so worshipped as we thought,"
1404,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Our love grows cold; and when we are not loved
1405,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,We cease to love. To illustrate permit:
1406,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1407,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,You’re on the topmost wave of fervid love--
1408,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A wilder flame than poets ever sung;
1409,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You’ve passed the timid declaration’s bounds,"
1410,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And revel in a full assured return.
1411,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"There is no need for check upon your heart,"
1412,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It has full leave to pour its gushing tide
1413,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of feeling forth, and meet responsive floods."
1414,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You meet her in the parlor’s solitude,"
1415,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,No meddling eye to watch the sacred scene.
1416,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The purple curtains hang their corded folds
1417,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Before the tell-tale windows; closed the door,"
1418,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And sealed with softest list. The rich divan
1419,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is drawn before the ruddy grate that glows
1420,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With red between the bars, and blue above."
1421,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You sit beside The Angel of your dreams,"
1422,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And gaze in adoration. What a form!
1423,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Revealed in faultless symmetry by robes
1424,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of rare, exquisite elegance, and taste,"
1425,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That fit the tap’ring waist and arching neck.
1426,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And how superbly flow the torrents of her hair!
1427,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Which she has shaken loose, because “it’s you”;"
1428,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Her great brown eyes that gaze so dreamily
1429,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Upon the flowers of the vellum-screen
1430,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That wards the fire from her tinted cheek!
1431,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"One hollow foot, in dainty, bronze bootee,"
1432,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Tapping the tufted lion on the rug;
1433,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A snowy hand with blazing solitaire--
1434,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The pledge of your betrothal--nestling soft
1435,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Within your own.
1436,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And thus you sit, and breathe"
1437,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With tones so soft, because the ear’s so near,"
1438,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The mutual confidence of little cares;
1439,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And how you longed for months to tell your love,"
1440,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But feared a cold rebuke; and how you dared
1441,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To hope through all the gloom; and how you grieved
1442,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,At every favor shown to other men;
1443,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"How now the clouds have flown away,"
1444,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And all is brightness, joy, and tender love."
1445,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then drawing nearer, round the slender waist"
1446,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You pass an arm; and nestling cheek to cheek,"
1447,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Palm throbbing palm, you hush all useless words,"
1448,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And thought meets thought, in silent love."
1449,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And now and then, you leave the cheek, to kiss"
1450,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The coral lips; yet not with transient touch,"
1451,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But with a fervid, lingering pressure there,"
1452,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As if you longed to force the lips apart,"
1453,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And drink the soul; while both her melting orbs
1454,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Are drooped beneath your burning inch-near eyes.
1455,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The parting hour must come. The good-night said,"
1456,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You rise to leave; and turning, at the door,"
1457,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You see her head drooped on the sofa’s arm,"
1458,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,You fancy she is sighing that you’re gone;
1459,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And stealing back on tiptoe, gently raise"
1460,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The beauteous face, and take it ’twixt your palms;"
1461,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And gazing on the features radiant,"
1462,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Distorted queerly by your pressing hands,"
1463,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You feel that life, the parting cannot bear,"
1464,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That you must stay forever there, or die!"
1465,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Another effort, one more nectar sip,"
1466,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You rush from out the room, and slam the door,"
1467,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Just on the steps, you meet your rival’s face."
1468,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He has an easy confidence, and walks"
1469,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Into the house, as if it were his own."
1470,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Poor fellow! how you really pity him!
1471,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You can afford to be magnanimous,"
1472,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And deprecate his certain, cruel fate."
1473,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You murmur: “Well, he brings it on himself,”"
1474,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And turn to go. The window’s near the ground,"
1475,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And slightly raised. Although you know it’s mean,"
1476,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You cannot now resist, but creep up near,"
1477,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And with a finger part the curtain’s fringe.
1478,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,You see your darling run across the room
1479,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With both extended hands, and hear her say:"
1480,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“Oh Fred! I am so very glad you’ve come,"
1481,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I feared that stupid thing would never leave,"
1482,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I had to let him take my hand awhile,"
1483,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And mumble over it, to get him off.”"
1484,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1485,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You grasp the iron railing for support,"
1486,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And, faint and dizzy with the agony"
1487,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of love’s departure, cling till all has fled;"
1488,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Then stagger home without a trace of love.
1489,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet only Self is touched; her beauty’s there,"
1490,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Her sparkling wit, and her intelligence,"
1491,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Her manner even, towards you, has not changed,"
1492,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And, were you with her, she would be the same."
1493,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Love’s every motive disappeared with Self,"
1494,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No pride of conquest, no romance of thought;"
1495,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You meet no sympathy, but ridicule!"
1496,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1497,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A mother’s love may last through injury,"
1498,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because it reaps the self’s reward of praise
1499,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For constancy, through wrong. The lover’s flame."
1500,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Unless supplied with fuel-self, dies out,"
1501,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For, burning, ’twould deserve supreme contempt."
1502,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1503,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The less affairs of life are traced to Self.
1504,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The code of Etiquette, that Chesterfield"
1505,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Defines “Benevolence in little things,”"
1506,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is but a scheme to give Self consciousness
1507,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of excellence in breeding, and to keep"
1508,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,“Our Circle” sep’rate by its shibboleth.
1509,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The stately bow, the graceful sip of wine,"
1510,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The useless little finger’s dainty crook
1511,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In lifting up the fragile Sevres cup,"
1512,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The holding of the hat in morning calls,"
1513,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The touch of it when passing through the streets,"
1514,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The drawing of a glove, the use of cane--"
1515,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Our every act is coupled with the thought
1516,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,How well Self does all this.
1517,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1518,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Our very words
1519,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Are used to gratify the self. Men talk
1520,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By preference, for they judge their words"
1521,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Will gain them more applause than listening.
1522,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But if attention yields more fruit to Self,"
1523,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"How patiently they hear the longest tale,"
1524,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And laugh in glee at its insipid close!
1525,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If with superiors, we attend, because"
1526,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Attention pleases more with them than words;
1527,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But if inferiors, we must talk the most,"
1528,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Since their attention flatters us so much.
1529,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The cause of converse, Self, is oftenest food."
1530,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"How few the talks that are not spiced with “I,”"
1531,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"What “I” can do, or did or will!"
1532,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1533,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Sometimes,"
1534,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Self is held, on purpose, up for jest;"
1535,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As when men tell a joke upon themselves.
1536,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But here the shame of conduct or mishap
1537,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is more than balanced by the hearty laugh,"
1538,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Which gives its pleasant witness to our wit.
1539,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,We never tell what will present ourselves
1540,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In such an aspect laughter cannot heal;
1541,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Although it compliments our telling powers.
1542,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1543,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Attentions to the fair, but seek for Self"
1544,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Their smiles of favor. Little deeds of love
1545,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To those around us, look for their reward."
1546,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The youth polite, who gives his chair to Age,"
1547,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“Without a thought of Self,” is yet provoked,"
1548,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If Age do not evince, by nod or smile,"
1549,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,His obligation to that unthought Self.
1550,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1551,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The very qualities we call innate,"
1552,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Arise and rule through Self. Our reverence,"
1553,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or tendency to worship, is to gain"
1554,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A good. Religion grows this tendency
1555,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Into the various Churches, all whose ends"
1556,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Are to secure eternal good for Self.
1557,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And those who preach that man does sacrifice
1558,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Himself for fellow-men, I ask, why none"
1559,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Will give his soul for others’? Many give
1560,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The paltry life on Earth for others’ good;
1561,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The very stones would cry “O! fool!” to him
1562,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who’d yield his soul; for that is highest Self,"
1563,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And nothing e’er can compensate its loss.
1564,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1565,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In all these things, Self stands behind the scenes,"
1566,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And men see not the force that moves them on.
1567,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But in the boudoir, ’tis enthroned supreme,"
1568,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And does not care to hide the cloven foot.
1569,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In every home, the marble and the log,"
1570,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In mammoth trunks, and chests of simple pine,"
1571,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In rosewood cases, and the pasteboard box,"
1572,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are crammed the slaves of Self, to poor and rich,"
1573,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The clothes that, fine or common, feed its pride."
1574,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The velvets, satins, silken _robes de flamme_,"
1575,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The worsted, calico, and homespun stripe;"
1576,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Guipure, Valenciennes, and Appliqué,"
1577,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The gimp, galloon, and shallow bias frill;"
1578,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Talmas, Arabs, basques and paletots,"
1579,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The coarse plaid shawl, the hood, and woollen scarf;"
1580,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The chignons, chatelaines, and plaited braids,"
1581,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The beaded net, and tight-screwed knot of hair;"
1582,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The dazzling jewels, ranged in season sets,"
1583,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The pinchbeck, gilt, and waxen trinketry;"
1584,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The tinted boots, half-way the silken hose,"
1585,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The shoes that tie o’er cotton blue-and-white;
1586,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The corset laced to hasten ready Death,"
1587,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The leather belt, that cuts the broad, thick waist;"
1588,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The bosom heaving only waves of wire,"
1589,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The bosom, cotton stuffed, beyond all shape;"
1590,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The belladonna sparkling in the eye,"
1591,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The finger tip, and water without soap;"
1592,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The rouge and carmine for the city cheeks,"
1593,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The berries’ ruddy juice for rural ones;
1594,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The pearly powder, with its poisoned dust,"
1595,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The cup of flour to ghastlify the face;--
1596,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All these, and thousand fixtures none can count,"
1597,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man’s vanity, and woman’s love of show,"
1598,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Appropriate for Self.
1599,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And such is Man!
1600,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The puzzle of the Universe! Within,"
1601,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A giant to himself; without, a babe."
1602,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A giant that we cannot but despise,"
1603,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A babe we must admire for his power.
1604,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His mind, Promethean spark divine, can pierce"
1605,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The shadowy Past, and gaze in rapturous awe"
1606,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon the birth of worlds, that from the Mind"
1607,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Eternal spring to blazing entities,"
1608,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And whirl their radiant orbs through cooling space;
1609,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or place the earth beneath its curious ken,"
1610,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And with an “Open Sesame!” descend
1611,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Into its rocky chambers, there unfold"
1612,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The stone archives, and read their graven truths--"
1613,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Earth’s history written by itself therein--
1614,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"How age by age, a globe of liquid fire,"
1615,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It dimmer grew, and dark and stiff,"
1616,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And drying, took a rough, uneven face;"
1617,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Above the wave, the mountain’s smoking top"
1618,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Appeared, beneath it gaped the valley’s gorge;"
1619,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But smoking still, it stood a gloomy globe,"
1620,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Naked and without life. And how the trees
1621,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And herbs their robes of foliage brought; their form
1622,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And life adapted to their heated bed.
1623,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And how a stream of animation poured
1624,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon its face, when ready to sustain;"
1625,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Great beasts who trod the cindered soil unscathed,"
1626,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And tramped the fervid plains with unscorched soles.
1627,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Great fish whose hardened fins hot waters churned
1628,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That steamed at every stroke. How periods passed
1629,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And fields and forests teemed with gentler life,"
1630,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The waters wound in rivers to the sea,"
1631,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Then spread their vap’ry wings and fled to land.
1632,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The oceans tossed in bondage patiently;
1633,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Volcanic mountains closed their festering mouths,"
1634,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And Earth made ready for her master, Man."
1635,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1636,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It traces Man, expelled from Paradise,"
1637,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Along the winding track of centuries.
1638,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It marks his slow development, from two,"
1639,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To families, and tribes, and nations vast."
1640,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It gazes on the wondrous scenes of war,"
1641,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And peace, and battle plain, and civic game;"
1642,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And lives through each, with all of real life,"
1643,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Except the body’s presence there. It turns
1644,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From man to beasts and birds, and careless strokes"
1645,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The lion’s mane, the humbird’s scarlet throat."
1646,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It tracks the mammoth to his jungle home,"
1647,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or creeps within the infusoria’s cell.
1648,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It measures Earth from pole to pole, or weighs"
1649,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The bit of brass, that lights the battery spark."
1650,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is Earth too small, it plumes its flight through space;"
1651,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From world to world, as bird from twig to twig,"
1652,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It flies, and furls its wing upon their discs,"
1653,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To tell their weight, and giant size, or breathe"
1654,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Their very air to find its gaseous parts.
1655,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Now bathing in pale Saturn’s misty rings,"
1656,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or chasing all the moons of Jupiter
1657,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Behind his darkened cone. The glorious sun,"
1658,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With dazzling vapor robe, and seas of fire,"
1659,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Whose cyclones dart the forkèd flames far out,"
1660,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To lap so hungrily amid the stars,"
1661,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is but its playhouse, where it rides the storms,"
1662,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That sweep vast trenches through the surging fire,"
1663,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In which the little Earth could roll unseen;
1664,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or bolder still, beyond our system’s bounds,"
1665,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It soars amid the wilderness of worlds;
1666,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Finds one condemned to meet a doom of fire,"
1667,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And makes its very flames inscribe their names,"
1668,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In dusky lines, upon the spectroscope."
1669,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With shuddering thought to see a world consumed,"
1670,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The fate prepared for ours, it lingers there"
1671,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Until the lurid conflagration dies.
1672,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And then seeks Earth, and leaves the laggard,"
1673,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Light,"
1674,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To plod its journey vast.
1675,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The smallest mote
1676,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of dust that settles on an insect’s wing,"
1677,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It can dissect to atoms ultimate.
1678,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With these, too small for sight, may Fancy deal,"
1679,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And revel in her Lilliputian realm.
1680,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"These atoms forming all, by Boscovitch"
1681,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are proved, in everything, to be alike;"
1682,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And ultimate, since indivisible."
1683,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Each in its place maintained by innate force
1684,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And relatively far from each, as Earth"
1685,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,From Sun.
1686,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Suppose, then, each to be a world,"
1687,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Peopled with busy life, a human flood,"
1688,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As earnest in their little plans as we,"
1689,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As grand in their opinion of themselves!
1690,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Oh! what a depth of contrast for the mind!
1691,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The finest grain of sand, upon the beach,"
1692,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Has in its form a million perfect worlds!
1693,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or take the other scale, suppose the Earth,"
1694,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Our great and glorious Earth, to only form"
1695,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The millionth atom of some grain of sand,"
1696,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That shines unnoticed on an ocean’s shore,"
1697,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whose waves wash o’er our whirling stars and sun
1698,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Too insignificant to feel their surge.
1699,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Another step on either side, and mind,"
1700,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In flesh, shrinks from the giant grasp."
1701,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet noble are its pinions, strong their flight;"
1702,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Thrice, only, do they droop their baffled strength,"
1703,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Before the Future, Infinite, Abstract!"
1704,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The first is locked, the second out of reach,"
1705,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The third a maze that none can penetrate.
1706,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The first, alone to inspiration opes;"
1707,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The second dashed to Earth her boldest wing,"
1708,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Spinoza’s, who essayed the idea God,"
1709,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And grappling bravely with the grand concept,"
1710,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So far above the utmost strength of Man,"
1711,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Placed God’s existence in extent and thought;
1712,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And filled all space with God. The Universe,"
1713,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A bud or bloom of the Eternal Mind,"
1714,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That opens like a flower into this form,"
1715,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And may retract Creation in Itself!
1716,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Alas! that effort so sublime should end
1717,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In mystery and doubt.
1718,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A Universe,"
1719,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"How vast so ever, has its bounds somewhere,"
1720,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But Space possesses none, and God in Space,"
1721,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Would be so far beyond Creation’s speck,"
1722,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He scarce would know it did exist. That part
1723,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of Mind, expressed in matter, would be lost"
1724,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Amid the Infinite domains of thought.
1725,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1726,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet Man in flesh, the casket of the mind,"
1727,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Whose wondrous power I’ve told, is ever chained,"
1728,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A grovelling worm, to Earth, and never leaves"
1729,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The sod where he must lie. No time is his
1730,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But present; not a mem’ry of the past.
1731,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His very food, while in his mouth, alone,"
1732,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Tastes good. He stands a dummy in the world,"
1733,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That only acts when acted on. How great
1734,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The mystery of union ’tween the two!
1735,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A feather touches not the body, but the mind"
1736,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Perceives it; yet the mind may live through scenes
1737,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The body never knew, nor can. Yet not"
1738,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,With vivid life--the sense is lacking there.
1739,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The memory of a banquet may be plain,"
1740,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So that the daintest dish could be described,"
1741,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As well as if the eye and tongue were there;
1742,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The eye and tongue, alone the present know,"
1743,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And find no good in anything that’s past.
1744,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All thought is folly, every path is dark;"
1745,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Truth gleaming fairly in the distant haze,"
1746,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,On near approach becomes the blackest lie.
1747,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man and his soul may go, nor will I fret"
1748,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To learn their mystic bonds. A worm I am,"
1749,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And worm I must remain, till Death shall burst"
1750,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The chrysalis, and free the web-wound wings."
1751,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet, oh! ’twere grand to spurn the clogging Earth"
1752,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And cleave the air towards yonder looming cloud;
1753,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To stand upon its red-bound crest and dare
1754,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The storm-king’s wildest wrath.
1755,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1756,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,My thoughts
1757,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Grew dull, my eyelids slowly closed, the scene"
1758,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Became confused and melted into sleep.
1759,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And far up in the blue, as yet untouched"
1760,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By clouds, I saw a white descending speck."
1761,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Methought ’twas but a feather from the breast
1762,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of some migrating swan, that Earthward fell,"
1763,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And watched to see it caught upon the wind,"
1764,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And sail a tiny kite to fairy land.
1765,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But circling down, the speck became a dove,"
1766,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A heron, then a swan, and larger still,"
1767,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till I could mark a pair of great white wings,"
1768,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Between which hung its wondrous form. Still down
1769,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It swept, till scarce above the trees it stood,"
1770,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Resting on quivering wings, as if it sought"
1771,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A place to ’light. I saw then what it was,"
1772,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A steed of matchless beauty, agile grace,"
1773,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Combined with muscled strength; but ere I drew
1774,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The first long breath, that follows such surprise"
1775,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It gently downward swooped, and at my feet,"
1776,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With dainty hoof, the turf impatient pawed."
1777,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Enrapt, I gazed upon its beauteous form,"
1778,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its sculptured head, and countenance benign,"
1779,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The soft sad eyes, the arrow-pointed ears,"
1780,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The scarlet nostrils opening like two flowers,"
1781,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The sinewed neck, curved like a swimming swan’s,"
1782,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The splendid mane, a cataract of milk,"
1783,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That poured its foaming torrents half to Earth,"
1784,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The tap’ring limbs, tipped with pink-hued hoofs,"
1785,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That touched our soil with a proud disdain;
1786,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The dazzling satin coat, and netting veins,"
1787,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And last the glorious wings, whose feathers lapped"
1788,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Like scales of creamy gold. What seemed a cloth
1789,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of woven snow, with richest silver fringe,"
1790,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Draped with its gorgeous folds the shining flanks.
1791,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1792,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It was perfection’s type, the absolute,"
1793,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Not one defect; the tiniest hair was smooth,"
1794,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The smallest feather’s edge unfrayed. The eyes
1795,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Without the slightest bloodshot fleck, or mote."
1796,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No fault the microscope could have revealed,"
1797,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Though magnifying many million times.
1798,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So great my wonder, that I could not move,"
1799,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But lay entranced, while he stood waiting there;"
1800,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till wearied with my long delay, he raised"
1801,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His wings half-way, and eager trembled them,"
1802,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As bluebirds do when near their mate; a neigh
1803,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of trumpet tone aroused me. Then I sprang
1804,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon his back, and wildly shouted “On!”"
1805,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A spring with gathered feet, a clash of wings,"
1806,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That made me cling in terror, and we swept"
1807,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From Earth into the air. Woods, plains, and streams"
1808,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Flashed by beneath, as, up and on, we charged"
1809,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Straight to the frowning cloud.
1810,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,My very brain
1811,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Reeled with our lightning speed, and dizzy height,"
1812,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And oh! how silent was the air. No sound,"
1813,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Except the steady beat of fanning wings,"
1814,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That hurled us on a rod at every stroke.
1815,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The bellowing winds were loosed and fiercely met
1816,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Our flight. They tossed the broad white mane across
1817,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"My shrinking shoulders, like a scarf of silk;"
1818,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They blew the strong-quilled feathers all awry,"
1819,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And like a banner beat the silvered cloth;
1820,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But swerving not to right or left, we pressed"
1821,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Straight onward to the goal.
1822,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,At last I reined
1823,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"My steed upon the shaggy ridge of clouds,"
1824,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And caracoled along the beetling cliffs,"
1825,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Up to the very summit. Then I paused.
1826,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Behind me lay the world with all its hum
1827,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of life, the distant city’s veil of smoke,"
1828,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The village gleaming white amid the trees;
1829,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The very orchard I had left, now seemed"
1830,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A downy nest of green, and far away"
1831,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I caught the shimmer of the sea, where sails,"
1832,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With glidings, glittered like the snowy gulls."
1833,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Behind all was serene, before me seethed"
1834,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The caldron of the tempest’s wrath.
1835,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Thick clouds,"
1836,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Thrice tenfold blacker than the black outside
1837,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We see, deep in the crackling fire-crypts writhed,"
1838,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And boiling rose and fell. A deafening blast
1839,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Roaring its thunder voice above the scene,"
1840,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As if the fiends of Hell concocted there
1841,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The scalding beverage of the damned.
1842,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,My horse
1843,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Had snuffed the fumes, and rearing on the brink,"
1844,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That fearful brink, an instant pawed the air,"
1845,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And then sprang off. A suffocating plunge,"
1846,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Through heat and blinding smoke, while to his neck"
1847,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Convulsively I clung! Down through the cloud,"
1848,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Until I gasped for breath, and felt my brain"
1849,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Was bursting with the fervid weight.
1850,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He stopped
1851,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Before a large pavilion, round whose walls,"
1852,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As faithful guard, a whirlwind fierce revolved,"
1853,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And at whose folded door, with dazzling blade,"
1854,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The lightning stood a sentinel. My steed
1855,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Was passport, and I passed within, but stopped"
1856,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon the threshold, dumb with awe. The walls"
1857,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Seemed blazing mirrors, whose bright polished sides"
1858,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,“Threw back in flaming lineaments” the form
1859,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of every object there,--a trembling wretch,"
1860,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With pallid countenance, shown ghastly red,"
1861,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon a horse of War’s own direful hue,"
1862,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I saw reflected there. The floor seemed made
1863,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of tesselated froth, whose bubbles burst,"
1864,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With constant hissing, into rainbow sparks;"
1865,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While like the sulph’rous canopy, that drapes,"
1866,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"At evening’s close, a gory battle-field,"
1867,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The roof of crimson vapor drooped and rose,"
1868,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,With every breath and every slightest sound.
1869,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And in the center of the glowing room,"
1870,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon a sapphire throne an Angel sat,"
1871,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Upon whose brow Rebuke and Wisdom met.
1872,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He gazed upon me with such pitying look,"
1873,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And yet withal so stern, that all my pride"
1874,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Was gone, and humble as a conquered child,"
1875,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I ran with trembling haste and near the throne
1876,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Kneeled down.
1877,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“Vain man,” he said, “and hast thou dared"
1878,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To doubt the providence of God; Behold!”
1879,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And, lo! one side of the pavilion rose,"
1880,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And out before me lay Immensity.
1881,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The frothy floor, now crumbling from the edge,"
1882,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Dissolved away close to my very feet,"
1883,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The walls contracted their three sides in one,"
1884,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And I, beside a throne I dared not grasp,"
1885,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Stood on a narrow ledge of fragile foam,"
1886,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That clicked its thousand little globes of air,"
1887,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,With every motion of my feet.
1888,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Far down
1889,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Below, the black abyss of chaos yawned,"
1890,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So vast, I gasped while gazing, and so deep,"
1891,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Sun’s swift arrowy rays flash down for years,"
1892,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And scarcely reach the dark confines, or fade"
1893,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Amid the impenetrable gloom. Methought
1894,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"’Twas Hell’s wide jaws, that opened underneath"
1895,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Universe, to catch as crumbs the worlds"
1896,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Condemned, and shaken from their orbit’s track."
1897,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And long I looked into the vast black throat,"
1898,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To trace the murky glow of hidden fire,"
1899,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or catch the distant roar. But all was still;
1900,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No murmur broke the silence of its gloom,"
1901,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No faintest glimmer told of lurking light,"
1902,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,No smoky volumes curdled in its depths;
1903,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As dark as Egypt’s plague, serenely calm,"
1904,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Defying light, the empty hall of Space,"
1905,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Where twinkled not a star nor blazed a sun.--
1906,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A grand eternal night!
1907,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I shuddering turned,"
1908,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With freezing blood to think of falling there,"
1909,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And stretched a palsied hand to touch the throne.
1910,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Angel’s eye was sterner, as he waved"
1911,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Towards my steed, who seemed of marble carved."
1912,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The wings unfolded, and he leaped in air,"
1913,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Beating from off the ledge the flakes of foam
1914,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That sank, with airy spirals, out of sight."
1915,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,With slanting flight across the gulf he sheared;
1916,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The moveless wings were not extended straight,"
1917,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But stood, at graceful angle, o’er his back,"
1918,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As, swifter than a swooping kite, he flashed"
1919,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Adown the gloom. His flowing mane broad borne
1920,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Out level, like another wing; his feet"
1921,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With slow ellipses moving alternate,"
1922,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As if he trod an unseen path. ’Twas grand
1923,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To see his graceful form, more snowy white"
1924,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Against the black relief, sublimely float"
1925,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Across the dark profound, and down its depths,"
1926,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Pass from my view. As when an Eagle soars
1927,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Beyond our vision in the azure sky,"
1928,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We wonder what he sees, or whither flies,"
1929,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So I stood wondering if he would return,"
1930,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And what his destination down th’ abyss.
1931,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
1932,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Above, around, all was infinitude"
1933,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of light and harmony. The worlds moved on,"
1934,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In mazy multitude, without a jar,"
1935,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Star circling planet, planet sun, and suns"
1936,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In systems, farther yet and farther still,"
1937,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Till multiplying millions mingled formed
1938,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A sheet of milky hue. And far beyond
1939,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The last pale star, appeared a dazzling spot,"
1940,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That flamed with brightness so ineffable
1941,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The eye shrank ’neath its gleam. And from its light,"
1942,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Athwart the endless realms of space, there streamed"
1943,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A radiance that illumed the Universe,"
1944,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And down across the chasm of Chaos flung
1945,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A wavering band of purple and of gold.
1946,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And in that distant spot my ’wildered eyes
1947,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Traced out the figure of a Great White Throne,"
1948,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Round which, in grand and solemn majesty,"
1949,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Slow swept Creation’s boundless macrocosm.--
1950,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I felt too insignificant to pray,"
1951,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But mutely waited for the Angel’s words.
1952,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He spoke not, but the curtains closer drew,"
1953,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And left a narrow opening in front.
1954,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then with a speed the lightning ne’er attained,"
1955,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Our cloud pavilion swiftly whirled through space.
1956,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A seed that would have slain me with its haste,"
1957,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Had not the Angel been so near.
1958,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As on the cars,"
1959,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We dash through towns, and mark the hurrying lights,"
1960,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or shudder at an engine rattling by;
1961,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So through our door, I marked the countless worlds,"
1962,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In clustering systems, chained by gravity,"
1963,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Flash by an endless course. A second’s time
1964,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Sufficed to pass our little group of stars,"
1965,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That waltz about our Sun, as if it lit"
1966,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The very Universe. Then systems came,"
1967,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Round which our system moves, and these"
1968,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Round others, till the series grew so vast"
1969,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I shrank from looking. Great Alcyone,"
1970,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Our telescopic giantess, a babe"
1971,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Amid the monsters of the starry tribe,"
1972,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The last familiar face in Heaven’s throng,"
1973,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Blazed by the door; an instant, out of sight!"
1974,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And after all that we have known or named
1975,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"On Earth were far behind, the millions came"
1976,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In endless multitude; and on we swept,"
1977,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till worlds became a dull monotony,"
1978,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And all the wonders of the Heavens were shown.
1979,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A planet wheels its huge proportions past,"
1980,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its pimpled face with red volcanoes thick,"
1981,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That, with our speed, seem girdling bands of light;"
1982,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A Sun, whose flame would fade our yellow spark,"
1983,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Roars out a moment at our narrow door
1984,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As through its blaze we fly, then dies away,"
1985,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Casting a weird and momentary gleam
1986,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Over the Angel’s unrelenting face;
1987,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A meteor tears its whizzing way along,"
1988,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,All showering off the scintillating sparks
1989,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That mark its trail. Far off, a comet runs"
1990,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its bended course, the mighty fan-like tail"
1991,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Lit with a myriad globes of dancing fire,"
1992,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That seemed like Argus’ eyes on Juno’s bird.
1993,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And on we sped, till one last Sun appeared,"
1994,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A monstrous hemisphere of concave shape,"
1995,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And brilliancy intense; it seemed to stand
1996,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"On great Creation’s bounds, a lense of light."
1997,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Close by its vast red rim we shaved, and passed"
1998,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Beyond, to empty space unoccupied."
1999,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No world, no sun, no object passed the door;"
2000,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The steady blue, tinged with a brightening gold,"
2001,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Alone was seen. Still on and on we flew,"
2002,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Until a score of ages seemed elapsed,"
2003,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And I had near forgotten Earth and home.
2004,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2005,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And yet the air grew brighter, till I feared"
2006,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That we approached a sun, so infinite"
2007,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In light, that I should sink in dazzled death."
2008,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2009,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We came to rest, the curtains fell away,"
2010,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And lo! I stood within the light of Heaven.
2011,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And oh! its glorious light! No angry red,"
2012,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Nor blinding white, nor sickly yellow glare,"
2013,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But one vast golden flood, sublime, serene,"
2014,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No object near, on which it could reflect,"
2015,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It formed the very atmosphere itself,"
2016,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"An air in which the soul could bathe and breathe,"
2017,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And ever live without its fleshly food.
2018,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2019,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No object near, for on the farthest bounds"
2020,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of space immense as mortal can conceive,"
2021,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Creation hung, a group of clustering motes,"
2022,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Where only suns were seen as tiny specks,"
2023,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And Earth and smaller stars were out of sight.
2024,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No object near, for farther than the motes,"
2025,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The walls of Heaven, in glorious grandeur loomed,"
2026,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet near as flesh and blood could bear.
2027,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,How grand!
2028,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,From infinite to infinite extent
2029,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The glittering battlements were spread, the height"
2030,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Above conception, built of purest gold,"
2031,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet gold transparent, for I could discern"
2032,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Though indistinctly, domes and spires beyond,"
2033,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And all the wondrous workmanship divine,"
2034,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That blazed with jewels, flashing varied hues"
2035,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In perfect union; and bright happy fields,"
2036,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That bloomed with flowers immortal, in whose midst"
2037,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The crystal river ran. And through the scenes
2038,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Thronged million forms, that each sought happiness,"
2039,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From million varied, purified desires."
2040,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Each face serenely bright as Evening’s star,"
2041,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And some I thought I knew, were dear to me;"
2042,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But as I gazed, they ever disappeared."
2043,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2044,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Along the walls, twelve gates of pearl were seen,"
2045,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So great their breadth, and high their jewelled arch,"
2046,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That Earth could almost trundle in untouched,"
2047,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And in each arch was fixed a giant bell
2048,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of silver, with a golden tongue that hung,"
2049,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A pendant sun. So wide the silver lips,"
2050,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That Chimularee plucked up by the roots,"
2051,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And as a clapper swung within its circ,"
2052,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Would tinkle, like a pebble, noiselessly"
2053,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Against the rigid side. And as the saved
2054,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Were brought in teeming host, by Angel bands,"
2055,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Before the gates, the bells began their swing;"
2056,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And to and fro the ponderous tongue was hurled,"
2057,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till through the portals marched the shouting throng,"
2058,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And then it fell against the bounding side.
2059,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And loud and long their booming thunder
2060,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Rends the golden air asunder,"
2061,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While the ransomed, passing under,"
2062,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Fall in praise beneath the bells,"
2063,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whose mighty throbbing welcome tells;
2064,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And the Angels hush their harps in wonder--
2065,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Bells of Heaven, glory booming bells!"
2066,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2067,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Gentler now, the silver’s shiver"
2068,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Purls the rippling waves that quiver
2069,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Through the ether’s tide forever,"
2070,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Mellow as they left the bells,"
2071,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whose softening vibrate welcome tells;
2072,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And the quavers play adown the river--
2073,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Bells of Heaven, softly sobbing bells!"
2074,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2075,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then the dreamy cadence dying,"
2076,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Sings as soft as zephyrs sighing;
2077,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Faintest echoes cease replying
2078,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To the murmur of the bells,"
2079,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Whose stilling tremor welcome tells,"
2080,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Faintly as the snow-flakes falling, lying--"
2081,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Bells of Heaven, dreamy murmuring bells!"
2082,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2083,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And in and out those Gates of Pearl, there streamed"
2084,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A ceaseless throng of Angels, errand bound."
2085,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From one came forth a band of choristers,"
2086,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With shining harps, and sweeping out through space,"
2087,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Their long white lines bent gracefully, they sang."
2088,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Although so far away, that purest air"
2089,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Brought every note exquisite to my ear.
2090,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"’Twas richly worth life’s toil, to catch one bar"
2091,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of Heavenly melody. Oh! I would give
2092,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"My pitiful existence, once again"
2093,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To hear the strains that floated to me then,"
2094,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So full, so deep, so ravishingly sweet;"
2095,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Now gentle as a mother’s lullaby,"
2096,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They almost died away, then louder rose,"
2097,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And rolled their volumes through the boundless realms,"
2098,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That trembled with the diapason grand;
2099,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Until eternal echoes caught the strain,"
2100,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And glory in the highest swelled sublime.
2101,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2102,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Entranced, I lay with ’wildered half-closed eyes,"
2103,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till from another gate, another host"
2104,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Marched forth, the armies of the living God."
2105,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Beneath their thunder-tread all Heaven shook,"
2106,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And at their head the tall Archangel strode.
2107,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,How grandly terrible his mien! His face
2108,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Lit with a soul that only kneels to Three;
2109,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The lofty brows drawn slightly to a frown
2110,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The eyes that beam with vast intelligence,"
2111,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The depths of distance piercing with their glance;
2112,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The chiselled lips, compressed with stern resolve,"
2113,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet marked with lines and curves of tender love,"
2114,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That ever with a sigh Wrath’s vial broke
2115,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon the doomed. His splendid form so tall,"
2116,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That as he paused a moment in the gate
2117,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,His dazzling crest just grazed the silver bell.
2118,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He wore no arms nor armor, save a sword"
2119,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Without a sheath, that blazed as broad and bright"
2120,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As sunset bars that shear the zenith’s blue--
2121,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A sword, that falling flatly on the host"
2122,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of Xerxes, would have crushed them as we crush"
2123,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A swarm of ants. An edge-stroke on the Earth
2124,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Would gash the rocky shell to caverned fire.
2125,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Unfolding wings would shake a continent,"
2126,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He floated down the depths. Behind him came
2127,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A million foll’wers, counterparts in all,"
2128,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Save presence of command.
2129,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I wondered not
2130,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That one should breathe upon the Syrian might,"
2131,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And still the sleeping hearts, four thousand score."
2132,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2133,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And from Creation’s little corner came
2134,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Guardian Angels, bearing in their arms"
2135,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Their charges during life. As laden bees,"
2136,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,They flew to Heaven’s hive; and some passed by
2137,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,So closely I their burdens could discern;
2138,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And though they came from far-off, unseen Earth,"
2139,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The stiffened forms were borne all tenderly.
2140,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some bore the dimpled babe, with soft-closed eyes,"
2141,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As if upon its mother’s breast; its hands,"
2142,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Unhardened yet by toil of life, its face"
2143,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Unfurrowed yet by care’s sharp plough; and some
2144,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The age-bent form, with ghostly silvered hair,"
2145,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And features gaunt in death, that would have seemed"
2146,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A hideous sight, in any light but Heaven’s;"
2147,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some bore the rich, who made of Mammon friends,"
2148,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who wore the purple with a stainless soul;
2149,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some bore the poor, who mastered poverty,"
2150,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And broke the ashen crust beneath God’s smile;
2151,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Their work-worn hands now folded peacefully,"
2152,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And passing towards the harp, the weary feet,"
2153,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So often blistered in life’s bitter dust,"
2154,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To tread with kings the golden streets of Heaven;
2155,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And some the maiden form bore lovingly,"
2156,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So fair, they seemed twin sisters."
2157,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And I saw,"
2158,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That, passing through the amber air, they caught"
2159,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its glowing dust upon them, and were changed,"
2160,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The livid to the radiant. Then as they
2161,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Approached the City, all the walls were thronged,"
2162,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And all the harps were throbbing to be swept.
2163,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And mid the throng there moved a dazzling Form,"
2164,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The jewels of whose crown were shaped like thorns.
2165,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He stood to welcome, and the gates unclosed,"
2166,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And passing through them, all the death sealed eyes"
2167,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Were opened, and they lived!"
2168,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And then I knew
2169,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"What happiness could mean. To leave the Earth,"
2170,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,With all its torturing pains and ills of flesh;
2171,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The lingering, long disease, the wasted frame,"
2172,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And, e’en in health, the constant dread of death,"
2173,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That like the sword of Damocles impends,"
2174,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And none may tell its fall.
2175,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And worse than flesh,"
2176,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The tortures of the mind in fetters bound;
2177,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its chafings at its puling impotence,"
2178,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its longing after things beyond its reach,"
2179,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its craving after knowledge never given,"
2180,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its constant discontent with present time,"
2181,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its looking towards a future, that but breaks"
2182,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To light alone in distance, never near;"
2183,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its maddening retrospect o’er wasted life,"
2184,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And loss of golden opportunities;
2185,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its consciousness of merit none admit,"
2186,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Its sense of gross injustice from the world;
2187,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The forced reflections on the sway of self,"
2188,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And consequent contempt for all mankind,"
2189,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or shameful servitude to their regard;
2190,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The poisoned thorns, that skirt the “Narrow Way”;"
2191,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The sneering laugh, the tongue of calumny,"
2192,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The envious spites and hates ’tween man and man,"
2193,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The doubts that swarm with thought about our soul,"
2194,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That whispers all our labor here is vain,"
2195,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That death is but extinction, Heaven a myth!"
2196,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2197,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To leave all these, and find a perfect life,"
2198,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To know that Heaven is sure eternally,"
2199,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That sickness ne’er again will waste our frame,"
2200,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That death shall never come again. The mind
2201,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In perfect peace and happiness; the hidden
2202,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Spread out before its ken; a sweet content
2203,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Pervading every thought, because “just now”"
2204,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yields happiness as great as future years;
2205,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because Life’s highest end is now attained.
2206,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The consciousness of merit, with reward"
2207,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Surpassing far all we deserved. A Home
2208,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of perfect peace, no envious spite or hate"
2209,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Within its sacred walls, but all pure love"
2210,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Towards our fellows, gratitude to God,"
2211,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A gratitude that all Eternal life
2212,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Will not suffice to prove. ’Twere joy enough
2213,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To lie before the Throne, and ever cry"
2214,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Our thanks for mercy so supreme! And oh!
2215,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The vast tranquillity of those who feel
2216,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That life on Earth is ended, Heaven gained!"
2217,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Angel marked my gaze of rapt delight,"
2218,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And said, “Wouldst thou go nearer?” Swift as light"
2219,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We moved towards the City. On the steps,"
2220,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In dreamy ecstasy, I lay, afraid to move,"
2221,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Lest all the panorama should dissolve.
2222,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I cared not that I was unfit to go,"
2223,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I cared not that I must return to Earth;
2224,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I felt one moment in the Golden walls
2225,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Was worth a dungeon’s chains “threescore and ten.”
2226,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The glory of its music, and its light,"
2227,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Grew too intense, and sense forsook my brain."
2228,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2229,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Again my eyes unclosed, and ’mid the stars,"
2230,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Familiar faces of the telescope,"
2231,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"We sped, while on the last confines of space,"
2232,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The City lay with golden halo girt.
2233,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The systems passed, we neared old homelike Earth;"
2234,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And far enough to take a hemisphere
2235,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"At single glance, we paused. The little globe"
2236,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Was puffing on, like Kepler’s idea-beast,"
2237,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With breath like tides, and echo sounds of life;"
2238,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Thus trundling on its journey round the sun
2239,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,While o’er its back swarmed men the parasites.
2240,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As rustic lad, who visits some great town,"
2241,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Returns ashamed of humble country home,"
2242,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,So I now blushed to own the world I’d thought
2243,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Was once so great.
2244,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Angel pointed down,"
2245,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And said, “Behold the vast domains of Earth!"
2246,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Behold the wondrous works of man, that calls"
2247,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Himself the measure of the Universe!
2248,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Those gleaming threads are rivers, and the pools"
2249,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,His boundless oceans. Those slow-gliding dots
2250,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The gallant ships, in which he braves the storms"
2251,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The largest white one, see, is laboring now"
2252,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Beneath a cloud, your hand from here might span;"
2253,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"What tiny tossings, like a jasmine’s bloom"
2254,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That drifts along the ripples of a brook!
2255,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Now on the wave, now ’neath it, now ’tis gone;"
2256,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The pool hath gulfed it like a flake of snow.
2257,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"See, there are railroad lines, what works of art!"
2258,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Thou canst not see the blackened threadlike tracks,"
2259,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But thou mayst see the thundering train, that creeps"
2260,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Across the landscape like a score of ants
2261,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Well laden, tandem, crawl across the floor."
2262,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,’Twill take a day to reach yon smoky patch
2263,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of pebbles! ’Tis a great metropolis!
2264,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Where Man is proud in power and lasting strength;
2265,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Where Art hath budded into perfect bloom,"
2266,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Where towering domes defy the touch of Time,"
2267,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And rock-ribbed structures reck not of his scythe
2268,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"On every side, proclaimed Creation’s lord,"
2269,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Poor flattered Man the title proudly takes--
2270,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"One little gap of Earth, and not a spire"
2271,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Would lift its gilded vane; the very dust
2272,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Would never rise above the chasm’s mouth.
2273,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And mark yon crowd outside the city’s bounds,"
2274,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,They hail Man’s triumph over Nature’s laws;
2275,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He conquers gravity, and dares to fly!"
2276,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The speck-like globe slow rises in the air,"
2277,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While all the throng below shout, “God-like Man!”"
2278,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,How pitiful! The flag-decked car but drags
2279,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its way, a finger’s breadth above their heads,"
2280,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And falls, a few leagues off, into the sea;"
2281,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When ships must rescue Man, the king of air!"
2282,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“He soon will touch the stars,” enthusiasts cry;"
2283,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His highest flights ne’er reach the mountain-top,"
2284,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That lifts its mole-hill head above the plain.
2285,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2286,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,What different views above and underneath!
2287,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From one, the silken pear cleaves through the cloud,"
2288,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And floats, beyond your vision, in the blue,"
2289,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And franchised Man no longer wears Earth’s chain;
2290,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The other sees him drifting o’er the ground,"
2291,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Beneath the level of the hills around,"
2292,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The captive still of watchful gravity.
2293,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2294,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon yon strip of land, two insect swarms"
2295,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are drawn up, front to front, in serried lines;"
2296,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"These are the armies, ’neath whose trampling tread"
2297,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The very Earth doth tremble, now they join"
2298,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In dreadful conflict. From the battling ranks
2299,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Leap tiny bits of flame, and puffs of smoke,"
2300,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Where thundering cannon belch their carnage forth;
2301,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The heated missile cleaves its sparkling way,"
2302,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The screaming shell its smoke-traced curve; the sword
2303,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Gleams redly with the varnish of its blood,"
2304,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The bayonets like ripples on a lake.
2305,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"How palsied every arm, how still each heart!"
2306,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,If one discharge of Heaven’s artillery roared
2307,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Above their heads--not that faint mutter thou
2308,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Perchance hast heard from some electric cloud,"
2309,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But when a meteor curves immensity,"
2310,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And bursts in glittering fragments that would dash
2311,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Thy world an atom from their path. But God
2312,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Hath thrown the blanket of His atmosphere
2313,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Around the Earth, and shield, it from the jar"
2314,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of pealing salvos, that reverberate"
2315,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Through Heaven’s illimitable dome.
2316,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet thou,"
2317,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The meanest of thy race of worms, hast dared"
2318,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To question God’s designs. Know then that He
2319,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Ordains that all, His glory shall work out."
2320,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The coral architect beneath the wave
2321,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Doth magnify Him, as the burning sun"
2322,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That lights a thousand worlds. His power directs
2323,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The mechanism of a Universe,"
2324,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Whose vastness thou hast been allowed to see,"
2325,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And yet the mottled sparrow in the hedge
2326,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Falls not without His notice. Magnitude
2327,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is not the seal of power, though man thinks so;"
2328,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The least brown feather of the sparrow’s wing,"
2329,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In adaptation to its end displays
2330,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"God’s wisdom, as the ocean. Harmony"
2331,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is Heaven’s watchword, key to all designs."
2332,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A tendency towards perfection’s end
2333,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Pervades Creation; to this perfect end,"
2334,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The polity Divine is leading Earth.
2335,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Endowed with reason, Man, perforce, is free;"
2336,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And God, forseeing how he’ll freely act,"
2337,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Adjusts all circumstance accordingly.
2338,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The order of this sequence, Man doth learn"
2339,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In part; adapts himself to these fixed laws;
2340,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And thus is formed a general harmony.
2341,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Although the individual may oppose,"
2342,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His forseen freedom, acting in a net"
2343,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of circumstance, secures the wished-for end."
2344,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The bloodiest wars are sources of great good,"
2345,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Invasive floods rouse national energies,"
2346,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or, mingling, form a greater people still;"
2347,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Hume’s skepticism foils its own design,"
2348,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And rouses lusty champions of the Truth,"
2349,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who build its walls far stronger than before.
2350,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Poor sordid Man! like all your gold-slave race,"
2351,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You deem wealth happiness. Hence, all your doubts"
2352,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,About God’s providence are based on gold.
2353,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The wicked have it, and the righteous not."
2354,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"What you assert is oftenest reversed,"
2355,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And in a census of the world, you’d find"
2356,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The good, in every land, the wealthiest."
2357,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But Earth is not the bar where Man is judged;
2358,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But only where free-will and circumstance
2359,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,May join in general progress. Gold is good!
2360,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then good depends on use of circumstance,"
2361,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And not on moral merit. Well ’tis so!
2362,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For were the righteous only blessed, all men"
2363,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Would righteousness pursue, from sordid aims,--"
2364,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The most devout, who love their money best;"
2365,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And thus good actions’ essence would be lost,"
2366,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That they be done for good, within itself,"
2367,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And not for benefit to be conferred.
2368,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2369,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Then for your doubts about the righteous poor;
2370,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A certain law is fixed for general good,--"
2371,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Some actions yield a gain and some a loss.
2372,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A wicked man may use the first, and gain,"
2373,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A righteous man may use the last, and lose;"
2374,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The wicked does not gain by wickedness,"
2375,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But by compliance with this natural law.
2376,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The righteous, still as righteous, might have gained"
2377,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By different course of conduct, had he known;"
2378,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But his condition now, can but be changed"
2379,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By special miracle; but miracles,"
2380,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In favor of the righteous, would destroy"
2381,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,All strife for good as good.
2382,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Their compensation in another world;
2383,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The poor may find
2384,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And even here, in consciousness of right,"
2385,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In surety of Heav’n, and peace of mind."
2386,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And in the case you’ve stated, like all those"
2387,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who talk as you have done, you overdraw,"
2388,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And color more with Fancy than with Truth.
2389,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You’ll find no widow, perfect in her trust,"
2390,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As you’ve described, who is so destitute."
2391,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Go search the lanes and alleys; where you find
2392,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The greatest squalor, there is greatest crime;"
2393,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For poverty is oftenest but a name
2394,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For reckless vice, and vile depravity."
2395,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Your case is but exception to the rule,"
2396,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And not the rule, of Providence. To give"
2397,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The righteous, only, wealth and worldly store"
2398,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Would take away Man’s freedom, and all good."
2399,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2400,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But I will answer in your folly’s mode.
2401,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The justice, then, of Nature’s laws you doubt,"
2402,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Forgetting they are fixed for general good,"
2403,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And not for individual. These laws,"
2404,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In their effects, you praise as very good;"
2405,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet, in their causes, call the most unjust."
2406,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The fertile fields, with grain for man’s support,"
2407,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are nourished by a miasmatic air,"
2408,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That, sickening but a few, feeds all the world."
2409,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While, were the air all pure, a few were well,"
2410,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And millions starving. In the tropics, too,"
2411,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The scenes you deprecate, themselves but cause"
2412,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The very beauties you admire. Unjust,"
2413,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,You would enjoy effects without a cause.
2414,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The goods of Nature often take their rise
2415,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From what to man proves evil. For the goods,"
2416,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He makes his mind to meet the evils; then
2417,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Can he complain, or think it hard to bear?"
2418,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But Nature’s dealings towards Man are just.
2419,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He knows that he is free, and Nature not;"
2420,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If he opposes Nature’s laws and falls,"
2421,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is Nature to be blamed? The widow’s cot
2422,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is frail; the laws of general good require
2423,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A storm; it comes, and shattered falls the cot."
2424,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Should God have saved it by a miracle,"
2425,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then all His people could demand the same,"
2426,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And Earth would soon become the bar of God,"
2427,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"God may exert a special providence,"
2428,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But Man may not detect it, as the rule"
2429,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Invariable of life, and still be free;"
2430,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For he were thus compelled to seek the good.
2431,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then Nature, over Man, holds not a tyranny,"
2432,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But keeps the perfect pandect of her laws,"
2433,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And Man is free to obey them, or oppose."
2434,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2435,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Like shallow-thoughted reasoners of Earth,"
2436,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You make assertions without slightest proof,"
2437,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or faintest shade of truth. Your thesis, this:"
2438,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"God marks with disapproval all the good,"
2439,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And blesses all the evil with His smile.
2440,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Entirely false in every case! The good
2441,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are ever happiest, in peace of mind,"
2442,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In ease of conscience, and the hope of Heaven."
2443,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The wicked may be even rich, but wealth"
2444,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And happiness are far from synonyms.
2445,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is happiness the child of circumstance,"
2446,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or is it not the offspring of the mind?
2447,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And if the mind be tranquil and serene,"
2448,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Does happiness not follow everywhere?
2449,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The cause of doubt in you, and many more,"
2450,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is that the thousands who profess the good,"
2451,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are ever mourning their unhappy lot,"
2452,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And sighing o’er the gloomy, narrow way;"
2453,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The tribulation of the promise read,"
2454,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Without its good cheer context. These are they
2455,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who stamp with misery’s blackest seal, a life"
2456,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of righteousness. By these you cannot judge,"
2457,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For they are not what they profess, and would"
2458,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Be miserable in Heaven, unless changed."
2459,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But take the truly good, one who’s content"
2460,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To take whate’er befalls, submissively;"
2461,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who feels assured that all works for the best;
2462,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Take him, in all conditions, rich or poor,"
2463,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In sickness or in health, in pain or ease;"
2464,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Compare your happy wicked, with his gold,"
2465,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,’Twill not require a moment to decide
2466,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Which one is happier!
2467,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Again, you ask"
2468,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Why Man was not created happy, and kept so?"
2469,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,His very freedom and intelligence
2470,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Prevents a forcèd happiness. The ends
2471,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of all Creation would be marred, and Man"
2472,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Lose personality. A happiness
2473,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Made universal, asks morality"
2474,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That’s universally compelled; and lost
2475,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is all the scheme of virtue and reward.
2476,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man, forced to action would degenerate"
2477,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Into a listless, lifeless thing; the world"
2478,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Lose all its fine machinery of thought
2479,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Combined with action. Beautiful variety
2480,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Could not exist, dull sameness would be life."
2481,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But Man is placed, with free intelligence,"
2482,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Amid surroundings from which he may cull
2483,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A happiness intense, whate’er their nature be."
2484,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If bright, the consciousness they are deserved;"
2485,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If gloomy, sweet reflections that they drape"
2486,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A future all the brighter for their gloom.
2487,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2488,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But Man, within himself, your puzzle proves;"
2489,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And not to you alone, for Angel wings"
2490,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Have hovered o’er your globe, and Angel minds"
2491,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Peered curiously into his soul, to learn"
2492,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its mysteries, in vain. The Mind Supreme"
2493,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That formed the soul, alone can understand"
2494,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Its wondrous depths. ’Tis not surprising then
2495,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That Man has tried in vain to know himself.
2496,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His mind, compared with his body, seems so great,"
2497,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He deems its power unlimited. He finds
2498,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It weak, before the barriers of thought,"
2499,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That gird it, mountain high, on every side."
2500,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,No path can he pursue that’s infinite.
2501,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And few exist, that do not thither lead."
2502,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Hence all the vagaries that have obtained
2503,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Among your race. The doubt of everything,"
2504,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is only too far tracing of a thought
2505,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Into absurdity intense. If you
2506,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Deem all the world effect upon yourself,"
2507,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A principle of fairness would demand
2508,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That you accord the right to other men.
2509,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The question then arises, who is he"
2510,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That really does exist, and all the rest"
2511,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,His ideas? Sure your neighbor has the right
2512,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To claim the honor, just as well as you!"
2513,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Hume’s foolish thought, extended to its length,"
2514,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Will answer not a single end of life,"
2515,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And terminates in nonsense none believe.
2516,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2517,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The conflict of the mental powers defeats
2518,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Your inquiries. You cannot reconcile
2519,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The unruled circumstance, with Man’s free-will"
2520,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You deem the motive free, and Man its slave;"
2521,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As if the motive, unintelligent,"
2522,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Could have a freedom, or a slavery!"
2523,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You make the motive to exist within the mind,"
2524,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When it, perforce, must be without. You get"
2525,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The unruled motive from the circumstance,"
2526,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When this itself must act upon the mind,"
2527,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And if _free_ motives rise within the mind,"
2528,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They are a _part_, and therefore _mind_ is free."
2529,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And what you deemed a motive to the mind,"
2530,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Was mental action, and its modes of thought."
2531,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The motive is confined to circumstance,"
2532,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And mind the circumstance can oft control,"
2533,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And even when it cannot, acts at will."
2534,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2535,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The mind may to a kingdom be compared,"
2536,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Where Reason occupies the throne. Beneath
2537,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its scepter bow, in perfect vassalage,"
2538,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The faculties, desires, and appetites."
2539,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"These then are acted on by motive powers,"
2540,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And straight report the action to their king,"
2541,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who does impartially decide for each.
2542,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The unruled motive is without the mind,"
2543,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And forms no part of it, although the parts,"
2544,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Receiving motive action, so are called."
2545,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Thus when you hunger, the desire of food,"
2546,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Confined to mind, is not a motive power;"
2547,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But urged by motive bodily demand,"
2548,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It tells the need to Reason, who decides."
2549,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Thus when you pare your peach, the tempting fruit"
2550,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And fleshly need, move on the appetite,"
2551,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who begs the Reason for consent to eat;
2552,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Your friend’s opinion of your self-control,"
2553,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is motive to Desire of esteem,"
2554,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who begs the Reason to refuse consent.
2555,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Reason, then, like righteous judge, decrees"
2556,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In favor of that one, more strongly shown;"
2557,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And feels a perfect freedom in its choice.
2558,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2559,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"’Tis most unfair to wait the action’s end,"
2560,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then cry, the mind was forced to choose this act;"
2561,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But choice is Reason’s free decree. Sometimes
2562,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Reason errs, and evil then ensues;"
2563,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But Reason, now more conscious that ’tis free,"
2564,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Regrets it had not acted otherwise.
2565,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By knowing what your reason deems the best,"
2566,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You judge how other men will act. You learn,"
2567,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By intercourse, what they permit to change"
2568,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Reason’s sentence. So, while with a friend,"
2569,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You show your wealth, because you know he’s free,"
2570,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And can, and will, resist impulse to crime."
2571,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Were he not free, you’d dare not go alone"
2572,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With him, for, any moment, might arise"
2573,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A motive irresistible, and he"
2574,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Would kill and rob, because that motive’s slave."
2575,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Were he not free, you were no more secure,"
2576,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In pleasant parlance, than on desert isle."
2577,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2578,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The laws are made for man, alone, as free."
2579,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For, otherwise, the motives they present"
2580,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Were blind attempts so coincide with Fate.
2581,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They would complete the gross absurdity,"
2582,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of Man collective governing himself,"
2583,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And therefore free, while individuals"
2584,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Are helpless slaves of motives they but aid
2585,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To furnish.
2586,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Fate, as held in fullest form,"
2587,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yourself has proved the theory of fools;
2588,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For were it true, a blind passivity"
2589,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Were Man’s perfection on the Earth. Compare
2590,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The two; Free-will as held, whate’er their faith,"
2591,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By every one, in daily practices;"
2592,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A world of harmony, for very wars"
2593,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yield good; a mechanism complicate,"
2594,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That even Angels, wondering at, admire;"
2595,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A world, whose wondrous progress is maintained"
2596,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,By practical belief in liberty.
2597,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And on the other hand, behold a world"
2598,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of universal inactivity!
2599,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Its millions starving for delinquent Fate;--
2600,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I doubt your faith would last till dinner-time,"
2601,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A morning’s lapse would change a hungry globe
2602,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To firm belief in free-will work for food.
2603,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2604,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With many, God’s foreknowledge binds free-will;"
2605,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He knows the future, how each man will act,"
2606,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And man can never change from what God knows.
2607,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They reason thus, that prescience is decree,"
2608,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And what God knows will happen, must take place."
2609,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That God may know the future of _free_-will
2610,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I prove by this. Suppose two worlds alike,"
2611,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And governed by two Gods. Each one can see,"
2612,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And foresee all transpires in both the worlds,"
2613,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet each o’er th’ other’s world exerts no power.
2614,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A man in one does wrong; the other God
2615,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"May have foreseen the action for an age,"
2616,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet had not slightest power to cause or stop.
2617,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Does his foreknowledge qualify the act?
2618,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If thus you can suppose, why not believe,"
2619,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,When errors flow from opposite belief?
2620,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"God in the future stands, and waits for man,"
2621,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who works the present, only gift of Time."
2622,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,There is no future save in God’s own mind.
2623,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Man’s future means continued present time;
2624,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"God’s future is but present time to Him,"
2625,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In which He lives, not will live when it comes."
2626,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man’s acts He sees as done, not to be done."
2627,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And God compels not more than Man does Man,"
2628,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who sees his fellow’s deeds, not causes them."
2629,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Man only knows Man’s present acts; but God
2630,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The future sees, as present to His mind."
2631,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2632,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To end with perfect proof, you know you’re free."
2633,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"This all the world attests, and each believes."
2634,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"How subtle soe’er may his reasoning be,"
2635,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He contradicts it throughout all his life;
2636,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And all his plans, and all the right and wrong"
2637,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of self and friends he bases on free-will.
2638,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If disbelief no inconvenience prove,"
2639,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Few men believe what is not understood;
2640,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And yet the most familiar things of life
2641,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Are far beyond their comprehensions’ power.
2642,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who understands the turning of the food
2643,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To sinew, muscle, blood, and bone? yet who"
2644,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Will starve because he knows not how ’tis done?
2645,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who understands the mystery of birth,"
2646,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And when and where the soul originates?
2647,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And yet a million mothers bend, to-day,"
2648,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"O’er tender babes, and know that they exist;"
2649,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A billion people know they once were born.
2650,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who understands the mystery of death,"
2651,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And how the soul is severed from its clay?
2652,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet who has not wept o’er departed ones,"
2653,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Received the dying clasp, the dying look,"
2654,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And known, full well, Death’s bitter, bitter truth?"
2655,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"None comprehends the movement of a limb,"
2656,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet many boast the powers of their’s might.
2657,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then why doubt freedom of the will, when life,"
2658,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In every phase, but proves its certain truth?"
2659,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The edifice of shallow theorists
2660,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Before the sweeping blade of practice falls.
2661,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2662,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Your dive into the heart yields folly’s fruit;
2663,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The selfish theory, carried to its end,"
2664,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Makes wrong of right, and overturns the world."
2665,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And strong it is in seeming; for the self,"
2666,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In human conduct, plays important part."
2667,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But ’tis not action’s only source, nor dims"
2668,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The quality of every action’s worth.
2669,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"’Tis true that Man exists in self alone,"
2670,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And in himself feels pain or pleasure. True,"
2671,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"An instinct teaches to avoid the one,"
2672,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And seek the other; true, that every act,"
2673,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"How small soe’er, gives pleasure or gives pain."
2674,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet thousand deeds are done without regard
2675,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To one or other, or effect on Self."
2676,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Howe’er an action may affect the Self,"
2677,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If he that acts has not a thought of it,"
2678,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The action is not selfish. You appeal
2679,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To Man, and so will I appeal to you."
2680,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You find a helpless brute, with broken limb,"
2681,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon the roadside, moaning out its pain."
2682,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Now, though to aid will surely pleasure give,"
2683,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And to neglect will cause remorseful pain,"
2684,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is there a single thought of this, when you,"
2685,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With kindest hand, bind up the swollen bruise,"
2686,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And hold the grateful water to its mouth?
2687,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is not each thought to ease the sufferer’s pain?
2688,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is not the Self first found, when on your way"
2689,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You go, with lighter heart, for kindness done?"
2690,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And while you think with pleasure on the deed,"
2691,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Would you not feel despised in your own eyes,"
2692,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,If consciousness revealed ’twas done for Self?
2693,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But should you say that Self was thus concealed,"
2694,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And still evoked the deed, the argument"
2695,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The same; if Self was out of thought, the deed"
2696,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Had other source.
2697,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In all, you thus mistake"
2698,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The deed’s effect, unthought of, for its source."
2699,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"God, in His wisdom, hath affixed to good"
2700,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Performed, a pleasure, and to evil, pain."
2701,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But selfish actions are not good, you’ve said,"
2702,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And therefore cannot slightest pleasure yield.
2703,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Here, then, your system contradicts itself;"
2704,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All actions emanate from love of Self,"
2705,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To find the highest pleasure for that Self;
2706,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And yet the pleasure’s lost by very search;
2707,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"What good soe’er apparently is sought,"
2708,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The consciousness of selfish aims destroys.
2709,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And here is wisdom manifest. When Self
2710,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Would seek the good, for pleasure to the Self,"
2711,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The pleasure is not found; but when it seeks
2712,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The good alone, true pleasure is conferred."
2713,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I mean the Self of soul, not Self of flesh;"
2714,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For pleasure to the sense, to be attained"
2715,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is sought; these two are mingled intricate
2716,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"(And hard to separate), in thousand ways."
2717,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But when Man’s higher Self would seek its good,"
2718,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It must forget the Self. In every case
2719,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You instanced, Self of soul must be unthought,"
2720,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For pleasure will not come at call of Self.
2721,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Your gambler none will doubt has selfish ends;
2722,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Not so the preacher, for his pleasure sought,"
2723,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Would ne’er be found; it must be out of thought.
2724,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His burning eloquence, his pastoral care,"
2725,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Can not proceed from any love of Self,"
2726,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For Self would suffer, when it knew their source;"
2727,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But as he acts from love of good as good,"
2728,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The Self is happy. When he ascertains
2729,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That some have died in sin through his neglect,"
2730,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Self is grieved, not that it was uncared,"
2731,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For care of Self would not allay the pain,"
2732,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But that a duty had not been performed;
2733,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That good had been neglected, as a good."
2734,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The gambler’s object may be highest good
2735,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For Self, according to his estimate;"
2736,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The preacher seeks a good, but not for Self;"
2737,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When Self appears, the good to evil turns."
2738,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Nor is the mystic selfish in his cave,"
2739,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Save that he buries talents in himself,"
2740,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That might avail for good to other men;
2741,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But all his mind is bent on pleasing God,"
2742,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,His only thought of Self is for its pain;
2743,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And this he deems acceptable to Heaven.
2744,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You can not judge by your analysis,"
2745,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But by what passes in the actor’s mind.
2746,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"One surely then could not be selfish termed,"
2747,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Who only lived to mortify the Self,"
2748,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Howe’er mistaken may his conduct be.
2749,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Nor is the man, who gives his wealth away,"
2750,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If from right principles he gives. ’Tis true,"
2751,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He finds a pleasure in the deed when done,"
2752,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But if to gain that pleasure he has given,"
2753,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It turns to gall and wormwood in his grasp.
2754,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If two men matches light, and know full well,"
2755,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If one is dropped, a house will be consumed,"
2756,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He is the most guilty that allows its fall.
2757,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The miser, then, who knows he does a wrong,"
2758,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is by that knowledge rendered criminal.
2759,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,“The quality of actions must be judged”
2760,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"From their intents, that often differ wide;"
2761,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The man who shoots his friend by accident
2762,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Has no intent, and therefore does no wrong;"
2763,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But he who murders does a score of wrongs,--"
2764,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A score of basest motives prompt the deed,"
2765,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,All centred in the Self. The Christian’s work
2766,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Must, from its very nature, have no Self,"
2767,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or it becomes unchristian. Man can judge,"
2768,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Not from effect, but motives ascertained"
2769,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By inference, and experience. The law"
2770,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is formed hereon, and modified by years."
2771,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Time teaches men that punishment will stop,"
2772,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And only punishment, the spread of crime."
2773,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Instinct and Nature’s order teaches you
2774,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That pain must follow wrong. A man commits
2775,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A crime; if left unpunished, he repeats;"
2776,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And others, seeing his security,"
2777,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Will do as he has done. So all mankind
2778,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Would hasten on to lawlessness and ruin.
2779,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But law, for real wrong inflicts a wrong,"
2780,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Which would be just did it no farther go;
2781,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But it is proved expedient, inasmuch"
2782,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As it prevents continued crime. Then death
2783,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By law can not be murder termed, since good"
2784,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In aim and end, without malicious thought."
2785,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Thus good to many flows from wrong to one
2786,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,(If that may wrong be termed that takes the rights
2787,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By conduct forfeited), who should receive,"
2788,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Though none reaped benefit. For many’s good,"
2789,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The law is made, yet never does a wrong"
2790,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To individuals, unless deserved."
2791,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2792,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Throughout your reas’ning, like all Earthly minds,"
2793,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When dataless, essaying hidden truths,"
2794,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You wander blindly in conjecture’s field,"
2795,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And if you find the truth, it is a chance."
2796,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You fain would raise a stone of skepticism,"
2797,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,By granting souls immortal unto beasts;
2798,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You prove your pointer must possess a soul,"
2799,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And by your argument, the trees have souls;"
2800,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For when an oak has fallen, every twig"
2801,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"May still be there, and something, life, be gone."
2802,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A chair, a table, anything you see,"
2803,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Possesses something, not of any parts,"
2804,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But that to which the parts are said, belong,"
2805,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then, one by one, take all the parts away,"
2806,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The something called the table must exist,"
2807,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For ’twas not in a part, nor is removed."
2808,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2809,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The mind of beasts exists but through their flesh,"
2810,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And is developed subject to its laws,"
2811,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And flesh is the condition of their life.
2812,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When flesh dissolves, the mind disintegrates,"
2813,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And ceases to exist. Man feels within,"
2814,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The consciousness of soul, that would survive"
2815,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Though flesh were torn to shreds upon the wheel.
2816,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The parts of soul that live alone through flesh,"
2817,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Must perish with it in the hour of death.
2818,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2819,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But having postulated Self, as source"
2820,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of human conduct, you compel the acts"
2821,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To fit your theory. You change effect
2822,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For cause. Where’er a moral pleasure’s found,"
2823,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,You judge that for its gain the deed was done;
2824,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As if the pleasure could be gained by search!
2825,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That Self does enter largely into inner life
2826,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is very plain, for everything affects,"
2827,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In some way, Self; but does the mind regard"
2828,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Effect, or is its object something else?"
2829,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The appetites, affections, and desires,"
2830,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You make of selfish origin, yet know"
2831,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That is not selfish, which alone affects;"
2832,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But acting with a reference to effect.
2833,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The appetites are instincts; as you breathe,"
2834,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You hunger, thirst, in helplessness. Not Self,"
2835,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But food or drink, the object of your thought."
2836,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And even while the taste is in your mouth,"
2837,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The mind dwells on the taste, not on the Self."
2838,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Desires are partly selfish in their mode;
2839,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Desire of knowledge, seeking honor’s meed,"
2840,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is selfish; led by curiosity,"
2841,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,’Tis not more selfish than an appetite.
2842,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Desire of power, esteem, and wide-spread fame,"
2843,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is selfish, when the thought of their effect"
2844,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,On Self shapes out the conduct; when desired
2845,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For their own sake, unselfish."
2846,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,On the list
2847,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Affections terminate, you falsely rail"
2848,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The mother, and the lover; both sincere,"
2849,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And both without a thought of selfish aim.
2850,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"’Tis no reproach to say the mother’s love,"
2851,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In fervid instinct, and development,"
2852,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is like the cow’s, that God in wisdom gives."
2853,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,No love so pure as that which moves the cow
2854,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To hover round her young, to bear the blows"
2855,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Impatient hunger deals the udder drained,"
2856,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To smooth with loving tongue the tender coat,"
2857,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or meet the playful forehead with her own;
2858,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With threatening horn, to guard approach of harm;"
2859,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And watch, with ceaseless care, the charge in sleep."
2860,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Her careful love continues, till the calf"
2861,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Has grown beyond her need, and ceases then."
2862,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A mother loves because it is her child:
2863,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,This is the surest reason you could give.
2864,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Th’ affection is spontaneous in her breast,"
2865,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But fed and strengthened by his life, if good."
2866,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The opposites to love you named, affect"
2867,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Her love, by not an injury done to Self,"
2868,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But by their evil, which her soul abhors."
2869,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Her son’s antagonism’s not to her,"
2870,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But to the good she loves. Her heart withdraws
2871,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Its twining tendrils from unworthiness.
2872,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As usual, you select supposed effects,"
2873,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And then assume their causes. Could you see
2874,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The mother’s heart, you’d find the loss of love"
2875,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Caused not by wrong to her, but wrong abstract"
2876,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Developed in the concrete deeds of crime.
2877,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Her love is governed by a moral sense,"
2878,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or idea of the good; the people’s thought
2879,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,About herself comes in as after-part.
2880,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Bad treatment to herself, although it pain,"
2881,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Deals not a fatal blow to love, except"
2882,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As showing lack of principle in him.
2883,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And so your lover is not hurt in Self,"
2884,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But moral sense. The loved one’s perfidy,"
2885,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And not her ridicule, beheads your love;"
2886,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Her stunning words were playful pleasantry,"
2887,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Did they not show the baseness of the heart.
2888,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Indeed, to turn your reasoning on yourself,"
2889,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Her manner even towards you has not changed,"
2890,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And were you present, she would still seem yours;"
2891,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Her eaves-dropped words do not affect the Self,"
2892,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Save as they show her falsity of heart.
2893,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And tossing on your pillow, through the night,"
2894,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The crushing thought of wrecked integrity
2895,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Gives deeper pain than all her ridicule.
2896,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And Self, though pained at thought of being duped,"
2897,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Enjoys relief in thought of its escape.
2898,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To show that Love is built on higher grounds
2899,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Than paltry good for Self; that it must have,"
2900,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As corner-stone, a percept of the good,"
2901,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Existing in the object loved, suppose"
2902,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You’re on the topmost height of wildest love,"
2903,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Your arm around her, and your lingering kiss"
2904,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Upon her lips; and Self is king of love.
2905,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"She, nestling on your shoulder, finds ’tis wrong,"
2906,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That love, however true, may grow too warm;"
2907,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That every kiss, however pure, abstracts"
2908,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some little part from maiden modesty,"
2909,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And steals a pebble from her honor’s wall
2910,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And rising with the firm resolve, says, “Cease,"
2911,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Unwind your arm, restrain your fervid lips;"
2912,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It may be wrong, and right is surely safe!”"
2913,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Now though the Self is bitterly denied,"
2914,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The rapturous clasp and tender kiss forbid,"
2915,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is not your love increased a thousand-fold?
2916,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Do not you feel intensely gratified
2917,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,At this assurance of her moral worth?
2918,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And would you, for the world, breath aught to cause"
2919,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Her pain, or least regret for her resolve?"
2920,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"How firm your trust, how sweet your confidence!"
2921,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You know ’twas not capricious prudery,"
2922,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For your caresses had been oft received;
2923,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Nor was it sly hypocrisy to win
2924,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Your heart, for that was long since hers. No thought,"
2925,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But spotless purity, inspired the act;"
2926,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And you are happy, though the Self’s denied."
2927,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2928,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The little things of life, that men account"
2929,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Without a moral value, may be done"
2930,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With reference to Self; but oftenest,"
2931,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The mind regards the act, not its effect"
2932,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon the Self. The code of Etiquette,"
2933,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The small amenities of social life,"
2934,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The converse, and the articles of dress,"
2935,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"May all belong to Self; but moral acts,"
2936,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Those known as right or wrong, have higher source"
2937,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Than Self in any mode.
2938,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Within Man’s breast
2939,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"There’s something, apprehending good and bad,"
2940,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Called conscience, or the moral sense; it views,"
2941,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Impartially, each act of his, decides"
2942,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Its quality by rule of right and wrong;
2943,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,All trust its judgments most implicitly.--
2944,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The good is found, yields greatest happiness;"
2945,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet seek it for the sake of happiness,"
2946,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And good is evil, with its misery!"
2947,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The good must be pursued, because a good,"
2948,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The evil shunned, because an evil. Thus,"
2949,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The moral sense discerns these qualities
2950,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In others, and directs our love."
2951,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A blow
2952,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The deadliest to our love, would be a blow"
2953,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Aimed at the principle of good. A love,"
2954,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Existing through the injuries done to Self,"
2955,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"May meet the public’s praise, and feel its own;"
2956,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But love would merit self-contempt, that loved"
2957,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whate’er opposed the good. The son may treat
2958,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The mother with unkindness, yet her love"
2959,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Be undiminished; if he lie, or steal,"
2960,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Her love is less; she cannot love his deed,"
2961,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And cannot love the heart from which they flow
2962,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So with the youth who gives his chair to Age,"
2963,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He does not so resent that Self’s denied
2964,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its meed of thanks, as that ingratitude"
2965,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Should thus be manifest, in little things."
2966,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A comrade, served the same, would anger cause."
2967,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2968,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But him who would give up the highest Self,"
2969,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The soul, for others’ good, you deem a fool;"
2970,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And ask why sacrifice ne’er claimed a soul?
2971,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because the soul cannot be sacrificed;
2972,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,No harm to that can others benefit.
2973,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But if it could, how truly grand the man"
2974,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who’d take eternal woe for fellow-men!
2975,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But God, who makes the soul the care of life,"
2976,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Makes every soul stand for itself alone,"
2977,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And in His wisdom hath ordained this law:
2978,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The greater good man gets for his own soul,"
2979,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The greater good on others’ he confers,"
2980,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While evil to himself, an evil gives."
2981,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
2982,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then comes the question of this abstract good,"
2983,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,That moral sense declares the end of life.
2984,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,What is its nature? whence does it arise?
2985,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And whence does man derive the half-formed thought?
2986,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You have compared the systems that define,"
2987,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Each in its way, the hidden theory."
2988,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"None satisfy, though each some element"
2989,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Sets forth in clear distinctness. Take them all,"
2990,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Select the true of each, as Cousin does,"
2991,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And will eclecticism satisfy?
2992,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And does the soul not cry for something more?
2993,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For something that it feels ’twill never reach,"
2994,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The good, as known to minds unclogged with flesh?"
2995,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man takes the dim outlines of abstract thought,"
2996,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And seeking to evolve their perfect form,"
2997,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The very outlines grow more indistinct;
2998,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As gazing at a star will make it fade.
2999,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man’s only forms of good are blent with flesh,"
3000,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And when he seeks to take the flesh away,"
3001,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And leave the abstract, he is thus confused,"
3002,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As if he should withdraw the wick and oil,"
3003,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And seek to find the flame still in the lamp.
3004,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
3005,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To learn the source of ideas of the Good,"
3006,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Trace Man collective, to his babyhood;"
3007,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For ’mid the prejudice of full-grown thought,"
3008,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The truth would be effectually concealed.
3009,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Through every people scattered o’er the globe,"
3010,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,There does prevail some idea of a God;
3011,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Though rude and barbarous this idea be,"
3012,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It still, in some form, does exist. The good,"
3013,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With all, bears reference to this thought;"
3014,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And what this Deity approves is good,"
3015,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And what He disapproves is bad. Men learn
3016,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"What He approves, and what He disapproves,"
3017,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"By revelation, inference, and instinct."
3018,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"God’s sanction then is origin of Good,"
3019,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Though afterwards men learn the sweet effects,"
3020,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And practise it for its own sake; and call
3021,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Their little effort, grandest abstract truth."
3022,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Developing in intellectual strength,"
3023,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They plaster up this good in various forms,"
3024,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Until, refined beyond all subtilty,"
3025,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It seems to them a self-existent good.
3026,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
3027,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The good is then a certain quality,"
3028,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In actions, or existence, that assures"
3029,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Divine approval. This vast idea, God,"
3030,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Creation sows in every human heart;
3031,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All Nature’s grand designs demand a God,"
3032,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A God intelligent. The same instinct
3033,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That tells His being, teaches what He loves;"
3034,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And what He loves with every people’s good.
3035,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But different nations entertain ideas
3036,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Diverse in reference to a Deity,"
3037,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And different notions of what pleases Him.
3038,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,One deems the care of God’s child-gift her good;
3039,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Another tears the heart-strings from her babe,"
3040,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And feeds, for good, the sacred crocodile."
3041,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
3042,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The good lies in the thought of pleasing God:
3043,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The consciousness that God is pleased with us,"
3044,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A pleasure yields, and good might there be sought"
3045,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For pleasure’s sake, and prove a selfish aim;"
3046,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But moral selfishness a pain imparts,"
3047,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And good, for pleasure sought, defeats the search."
3048,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
3049,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The good is sought, because it pleases God,"
3050,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Not with the doer, but with what is done."
3051,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Good has its origin in th’ idea God,"
3052,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And what He loves; but to continue good
3053,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It must retain approval in the act,"
3054,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And not transfer it to the agent’s self.
3055,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The consciousness that God approves a deed,"
3056,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Makes Man approve, and thus his mind is brought"
3057,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,In correlation with the Mind Divine.
3058,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The man who does an alms, if done to gain"
3059,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"God’s favor for himself, feels selfish pain;"
3060,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But if because the act, not he, will please,"
3061,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He finds the pleasure. Man, as time rolls on,"
3062,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Finds general laws that please or displease God,"
3063,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And ranging, under these, subordinates"
3064,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Amenable to them and not to God,"
3065,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The moral quality of lesser deeds
3066,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He reckons by these laws, nor does ascend"
3067,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To God, that gives their moral quality."
3068,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Jouffroy, in Order, placed the Abstract Good,"
3069,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And paused a step below the real truth,"
3070,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The idea God, whence Order emanates."
3071,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
3072,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Thus Man, progressing, good withdraws from God"
3073,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And seems an independent entity,"
3074,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And man denominates it, Abstract Good."
3075,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,He can attain the Abstract but in part;
3076,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When mind is freed from flesh, he may attain"
3077,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To its full grandeur. Here, at most, he grasps"
3078,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A faint outline, and fits it on concrete."
3079,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"No concept occupies one act of mind,"
3080,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But opening the lettered label, he"
3081,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"May count the attributes, and by an act"
3082,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Complex, of memory and cognition, gain"
3083,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some idea of his Abstract. Thus of “Man,”"
3084,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"One act can only cognize M-A-N,"
3085,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But opening, he finds the attributes,"
3086,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As “mammal,” “biped,” “vertebrate.” This act"
3087,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Is complex, and he cannot unitize,"
3088,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Save by the bundle of a word. You’ve said
3089,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"It answers all the purposes of life,"
3090,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Then why seek more? lest speculation vain
3091,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Point out dim realms, where Man can never tread,"
3092,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"These baffling thoughts are given, as peacocks’ feet,"
3093,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To Man’s fond pride. The simplest avenue
3094,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of thought, pursued, will reach absurdity,"
3095,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To comprehension finite.
3096,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Even the truth
3097,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of numbers you presume to doubt. Two balls,"
3098,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You claim, can ne’er be two unless alike."
3099,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You mingle quantity and number, foolishly,"
3100,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As if a ball the size of Earth, and one,"
3101,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A tiny mustard-seed, would not be two!"
3102,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"You deem all Mathematics wide at fault,"
3103,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because Man’s powers to illustrate are weak.
3104,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Earth has oft seen a pure right angle drawn,"
3105,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Because Man’s sight could not detect a flaw;
3106,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And if to his discernment perfect made,"
3107,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He must admit its perfect form. If life,"
3108,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In every intricate demand, finds truth,"
3109,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Why seek to overturn by sophistry?
3110,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,You see and know Achilles far beyond
3111,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The tortoise, yet the super-wise must prove"
3112,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That he can never pass the creeping thing,"
3113,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Although his speed a hundred times as swift!
3114,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When Man commences, he may find a doubt"
3115,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In everything; his life, his neighbor’s life,"
3116,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The outside world, may all be but a myth;"
3117,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then let him so believe, but let him act"
3118,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Consistently; but does the skeptic so?
3119,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He crams all Nature in his little mind,"
3120,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet how he cringes to her slightest law!
3121,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He flees the rain, and wards the cold, or fears"
3122,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The lightning’s glittering blow. He doubts his frame
3123,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Can work by mechanism so absurd,"
3124,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Yet will not for a day refrain from food!
3125,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
3126,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When Man compares his body and his mind,"
3127,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And tries the power of each, he magnifies"
3128,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The mind to Deity, and yet how small"
3129,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Compared with what it has to learn! The more
3130,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man knows, the more he finds he does not know;"
3131,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And as a traveller toiling up the hill,"
3132,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Each upward step reveals a wider view
3133,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Of fields of thought sublime he dares not hope
3134,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To ever reach in life; and wearily he sits
3135,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Him down upon the mountain-side, so far"
3136,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Beneath its untrod top, and recklessly"
3137,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Doubts everything, because beyond his grasp."
3138,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
3139,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All skeptic reasoning ends, as did your own,"
3140,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,No fruit but blind bewilderment of thought!
3141,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And none but fools will e’er believe sincere
3142,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The faith that doubts alone by theory,"
3143,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And yet approves by practice. Such is yours;
3144,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The stern necessities of life demand
3145,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A practical belief, and such is given;"
3146,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And still, forsooth, because your narrow mind"
3147,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Cannot contain the Truth in perfect form,"
3148,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,You dare deny it does exist. But few
3149,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of skeptic minds are let to live on Earth,"
3150,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And even these made instruments of good,"
3151,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In calling forth defenders of the Truth,"
3152,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Who add their strength to its Eternal Walls.
3153,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Then here behold God’s wisdom manifest!
3154,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Amid the care of countless greater orbs,"
3155,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He watches Earth, and knows its smallest thing."
3156,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While Man, as individual, is free,"
3157,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Collective Man is being surely led
3158,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Towards an end, but when it will be reached,"
3159,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,God knows alone. Then Man will be removed
3160,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Into a higher or a lower sphere,"
3161,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,As he has worthy proved. With Man ’twill be
3162,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,A great event; his awful Judgment-day!
3163,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"When from those far-off realms, the Son shall come"
3164,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With Angel retinue, and through the worlds,"
3165,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Shall lead their solemn flight, to where we stand;"
3166,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And as the trump shall peal its clarion tones,"
3167,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And beat away Earth’s gauze of atmosphere,"
3168,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The millions living, and the billions dead,"
3169,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Will leave the sod, and “caught up in the air,”"
3170,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Shall stand before the Throne, to hear their doom."
3171,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then, faces pale with fear, and trembling limbs,"
3172,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Will be on every side, as on the air"
3173,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They rest, with nothing solid ’neath their feet;"
3174,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And see dismantled Earth burst into flames,"
3175,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And reel along its track, a globe of fire,"
3176,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The volumed smoke, a dusky envelope;"
3177,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Its revolutions wrapping pliant flames,"
3178,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In scarlet girdles, round its bulging waist,"
3179,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And hurling streams of centrifugal sparks,"
3180,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In broad red tangents, from the burning orb."
3181,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon the conflagration Man will gaze,"
3182,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With shuddering horror; ’tis his only home,"
3183,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The scene of all his fame, the source of wealth,"
3184,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For which he toiled so wearily. All gone!
3185,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He would not touch a mountain of pure gold,"
3186,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For ’twould be useless now! Poor, pauper Man,"
3187,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Without his money, chiefest aim of life,"
3188,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Stands homeless ’mid a Universe, to learn"
3189,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"If God will be his Father, or his Foe!"
3190,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And from the blackness underneath, the swarms"
3191,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of Evil ones are thronged, their hideous forms"
3192,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Half shown in lurid light, as here and there"
3193,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They flit, like sharks, expectant of their prey."
3194,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then comes the closing scene. The sentence passed,"
3195,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The righteous breaking forth to joyous praise,"
3196,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Shall thread Creation’s wondrous maze of life,"
3197,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And with their Leader, sweep towards yon Heaven;"
3198,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While down the black abyss, with cries of woe"
3199,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That make the darkness tremble, the condemned"
3200,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Are dragged, into its gloom,--and all is o’er--"
3201,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Earth’s ashes float in scattered clouds through space--
3202,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To Man the grandest era of all Time,"
3203,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To God, completion of Salvation’s scheme!"
3204,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
3205,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But Man deems Judgment too far off for thought,"
3206,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Nor will prepare for such a distant fate;
3207,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet there is something, far more sure than aught"
3208,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Uncertain life can offer; its decision, too,"
3209,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Is just as final as the Judgment doom;
3210,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And still ’tis oftenest farthest from the thought.
3211,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"’Tis Death, the welcome or unwelcome guest"
3212,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of every man, and yet how few prepare"
3213,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,For its approach! They give all else a care;
3214,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Wealth, honor, fame, get all their time,"
3215,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While certain Death’s forgotten, till disease"
3216,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Gives warning; then with hasty penitence,"
3217,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The knees are worn, the heart’s thick rubbish cleared;"
3218,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But oft too late; the heart will not be cleared,"
3219,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The stubborn knees will not consent to bend,"
3220,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The house is set in order, while the guest,"
3221,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"In sable robes, stands at the throbbing door."
3222,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
3223,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And now to close thy lesson, look through this!"
3224,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"He gave to me a strangely fashioned glass,"
3225,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Through which, when I had looked to Earth, I saw"
3226,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A long black wall, that towered immensely high,"
3227,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So none might see beyond. Before its length,"
3228,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Mankind were ranged, all weaving busily;"
3229,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The young and old, the maiden and the man;"
3230,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The infant hands unconscious plied the thread,"
3231,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The aged with a feeble, listless move."
3232,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They wove the warp of Life, and drew its thread"
3233,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,From o’er the wall; none knew how far its end
3234,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Was off, nor when ’twould reach the busy hand,"
3235,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Nor did they care, in aught by action shown,"
3236,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But bending o’er their work, without a glance"
3237,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Towards the thread, that still so smoothly ran,"
3238,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"They threw the shuttle back and forth again,"
3239,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till suddenly the ravelled end appeared,"
3240,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Fell from the wall, and to the shuttle crept;"
3241,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And then the weaver laid his work aside,"
3242,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With folded hands, was wrapped within his warp,"
3243,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To wait the Master’s sentence on his task.
3244,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I saw the thread, in passing through their hands,"
3245,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Received the various colors, from their touch,"
3246,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And tinged the different patterns that they wove.
3247,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And oh! how different in design! Some wove
3248,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A spotless fabric, whose pure simple plan"
3249,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Was always ready for the ending thread;
3250,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Come when it would, no part was incomplete;"
3251,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But what was done, could bear th’ Inspector’s eye."
3252,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And others wove a dark and dingy rag,"
3253,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"That bore no pattern, save its filthiness;"
3254,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Fit garment for the fool who weaves for flames!
3255,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some wove the great red woof of war,"
3256,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With clashing swords, and crossing bayonets,"
3257,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With ghastly bones, and famished widows’ homes,"
3258,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With all the grim machinery of Death,"
3259,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To gain a paltry crown, or curule chair;"
3260,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Perchance, before the crown or chair is reached,"
3261,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The thread gives out, the work is incomplete,"
3262,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And in the gory cloak his hands have wrought,"
3263,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With all its stains unwashed, the hero sleeps."
3264,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Some shuttles shape the gilded temple, Fame,"
3265,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And count on thread to weave its topmost dome;
3266,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But ere the lowest pinnacle is touched,"
3267,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,The brittle filament is snapped. Some weave
3268,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The bema, with its loud applause; and some"
3269,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The gaudy chaplet of the bacchanal,"
3270,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And others sweated bays of honest toil.
3271,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,But all the fabrics bear the yellow stain
3272,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of gold, o’er which the sinner and the saint"
3273,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Unseemly strive, and he seems happiest"
3274,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whose work is yellowest.
3275,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Along the wall,"
3276,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"“A fountain filled with blood,” plays constantly,"
3277,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Where man may cleanse the fabric as he weaves;
3278,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Yet few avail themselves; the waters flow,"
3279,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"While Man works on, without regard to stains,"
3280,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Till thread worn thin arouses him to fear,"
3281,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Or breaks before the damning dyes are cleansed.
3282,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,
3283,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And down the line I ran my anxious eyes,"
3284,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"To find a weaver I might recognize,"
3285,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And saw, at last, a form by mirrors known."
3286,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Oh! ’twas a shameful texture that I wove,"
3287,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So dark its hue, so little saving white,"
3288,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Such seldom bathing in the fountain stream,"
3289,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I could not look, but bowed my blushing face,"
3290,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And like the publican of old, cried out,"
3291,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,“Be merciful to me a sinner!”
3292,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,“Rise!”
3293,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The Angel said, “And worship God alone,"
3294,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Return to Earth, enjoy an humble faith,"
3295,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Whose simple trust shall make thee happier
3296,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Than all the grandeur of philosophy.
3297,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Should doubts arise, remember, God’s designs"
3298,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Above a finite comprehension stand,"
3299,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And finite doubts, about the Infinite,"
3300,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Assume absurdity’s intensest form.
3301,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man, from the stand-point of the Present, looks,"
3302,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And disappointed, bitterly complains"
3303,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of what would move his deepest gratitude,"
3304,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Could he the issue of the morrow know.
3305,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"God sees the future, and in kindness deals"
3306,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To every man his complement of good.
3307,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Remember then the weakness of thy mind,"
3308,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Nor doubt because thou canst not understand.
3309,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To gather scattered jewels thou must kneel;
3310,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"So on thy knees seek truth, and thou shalt find;"
3311,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The nearer Earth thy face, the nearer Heaven"
3312,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Thy heart. And now farewell!”
3313,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,I sprang to clasp
3314,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"His hand in gratitude, but with a wave"
3315,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Of parting benediction, he was gone!"
3316,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Then in an instant, like an aerolite,"
3317,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"With naught to bear me up, I fell to Earth,"
3318,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Swifter and swifter, with increasing speed!"
3319,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Now bursting through a sunlit bank of cloud,"
3320,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And clutching, vainly, at the yielding mist,"
3321,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Or through a cradling storm, with thunder charged,"
3322,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Down through the open air, whose parted breath"
3323,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Hissed death into my ears, while all below"
3324,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Seemed rushing up to meet and mangle me.
3325,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"I shrieked aloud, “Oh save me!”--"
3326,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And awoke.
3327,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The day was o’er, and night had drawn her shades;"
3328,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The twinkling eyes of Heaven shone through the leaves,"
3329,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And lit the tiny rain-globes on the grass;
3330,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"The cloud had passed, and on th’ horizon’s verge,"
3331,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"A monster firefly, with shimmering flash,"
3332,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,It slowly crawled behind the curve of death.
3333,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And evening’s silence deeper seemed than noon’s,"
3334,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"For not a sound disturbed the hush of night,"
3335,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Save katydids, with quavering monotones,"
3336,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,Returning contradictions from the trees.
3337,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"All drenched and chilled, with trembling limbs I rose,"
3338,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,And homeward bent my steps; and pondering
3339,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Upon my dream, this moral from it drew:"
3340,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"Man cannot judge the Eternal Mind by his,"
3341,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"But must accept the mysteries of Life,"
3342,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"As purposes Divine, with perfect ends."
3343,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,"And in our darkest clouds, God’s Angels stand,"
3344,THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD,To work Man’s present and eternal good.

3585,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"And he seemed much perplexed as to what he must do,"
3586,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"For his dark brows would knit, and he’d stamp on the ground,"
3587,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,And flap his great wings till floating around

3589,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,At last with an air
3590,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Of resolve he threw himself back in his chair,"
3591,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Lit a brimstone cigar, and touched a small bell."
3592,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"An imp appeared, bowed, and on his face fell."

3597,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"“Well, Cloven-foot, I had most certainly thought"
3598,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"When from Africa’s wilds that baboon you brought,"
3599,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,He’d prove such a guard for the great Sulphur Lake
3600,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,The wretches would ne’er cease before him to quake.

3605,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"As ’tis possible, and above all things to choose"
3606,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,An object whose countenance never will lose
3607,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Its hideous novelty.” The imp bowed and withdrew,"
3608,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,And swiftly to earth on his errand he flew;
3609,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"But in vain did he search where the gorillas roam,"
3610,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Or the jungles of Bengal, the fierce tiger’s home."
3611,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,In vain throughout Europe he searched every place;
3612,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,Nowhere could he find the requisite face.
3613,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Frustrated and weary, with deep despair frantic,"
3614,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,He was skimming the waves of the tossing Atlantic.
3615,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"A few pinion strokes, and he stood on the shore"
3616,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Of the New World, and through it began to explore."
3617,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"But all was in vain, till he chanced to alight"
3618,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"In a sweet little village, one smiling morn bright."
3619,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Disguising himself, he attended the church,"
3620,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Not hoping to find the object of search,"
3621,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,But just for the fun.
3622,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,As he stood with the throng
3623,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"That were watching the College girls marching along,"
3624,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,He caught a slight glimpse of Miss “Tater’s” sweet face;
3625,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"He sprang to her side, clasped her in embrace,"
3626,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"And as he plunged downward he said to himself,"
3627,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,“Here’s one will compete with the African elf.”
3628,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"He soon furled his wing on the Plutonian shore,"
3629,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,And to his dark ruler his fair burden bore.
3630,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,As the Valentine sender came into sight
3631,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,The Devil himself started back with affright.
3632,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"“Whew! whew!” whistled he, “she’ll do, I declare!"
3633,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Go bring the baboon, and let them compare.”"
3634,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"The imp disappeared, then returned with the ape,"
3635,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,A creature most frightful in feature and shape.
3636,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"His head was oblong and perfectly bald,"
3637,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,Running back from his eyes--no forehead at all;
3638,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"His eyeballs were white, their sockets deep red;"
3639,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"His long, glistening teeth strung with human-flesh shred,"
3640,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,The gore of his victims from his fingers’ ends flowed;
3641,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"And round his lank limbs candescent chains glowed,"
3642,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,In front of Miss “Taters” this creature was led;
3643,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"He gave a look, yelled, and fainted stone dead."
3644,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"“By my tongs,” quoth the Devil, “she’s rather too hard"
3645,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,For the old fellow; she’ll make a capital guard.
3646,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,Take her down to the fire.” The imp led the way
3647,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"And far down they went from the clear light of day,"
3648,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Down, down, till the air was all smoky and red,"
3649,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,Till the tumult of hell seemed bursting her head;
3650,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Down, down, till the piteous wails and the moans"
3651,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,Of the tortured but echoed the jeers and the groans
3652,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Of the fiends. Down, down, till they came to the lake"
3653,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"That scorches and scalds, but never will slake"
3654,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,The thirst of its victims. Far out on its breast
3655,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,It would heave them anon on the red foaming crest
3656,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Of a billow, then plunge them far deeper beneath"
3657,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Its boiling bosom, in torture to seethe."
3658,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Along the hot shore the poor creatures would crawl,"
3659,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,To pant and to rest from their terrible thrall.
3660,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"From their bodies all smoking the lava would stream,"
3661,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"While the shriveled flesh peeled from each quiv’ring limb,"
3662,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"And their heart-piercing shrieks rose higher and higher,"
3663,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,As the tongue of each wave licked them back in the fire.
3664,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,But as soon as Miss “Taters” had come where they were
3665,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"Every noise was hushed, not a sound could you hear."
3666,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"’Twas a wonder indeed, and the wonder increased,"
3667,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,When the billows of crimson their torture surge ceased.
3668,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"When the imp had examined more closely, he found"
3669,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"The victims had fainted, the fire gone down."
3670,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"He hurried her back to his master and said,"
3671,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"“The fires are out, and the wretches are dead.”"
3672,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,"“What, the fires extinguished! those fires of old!"
3673,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,Take her back! I begin e’en myself to feel cold!
3674,THE GUARD OF THE SULPHUR LAKE,She’ll ruin us all with her terrible face;

4124,OUT IN THE RAIN,"Up in its painted cage, the little bird,"
4125,OUT IN THE RAIN,"His yellow head beneath his soft, warm wing,"
4126,OUT IN THE RAIN,"Is hiding. Oh! my God, out in the storm"
4127,OUT IN THE RAIN,_Our little yellow head_ is beaten by the rain.
4128,OUT IN THE RAIN,So lonely looks that precious little face
4129,OUT IN THE RAIN,"Up at the cold, dark coffin’s lid above,"
4130,OUT IN THE RAIN,In the bleak graveyard’s solitude!
4131,OUT IN THE RAIN,"Oh! Ethel darling, do you feel afraid?"
4132,OUT IN THE RAIN,Or is Christ with you in your little grave?
4133,OUT IN THE RAIN,When last we gazed upon those lovely eyes
4134,OUT IN THE RAIN,"They looked so tranquil, in their last repose,"
4135,OUT IN THE RAIN,We knew that Christ’s own tender hand had sealed
4136,OUT IN THE RAIN,Their lids with His eternal peace.
4137,OUT IN THE RAIN,"Oh! darling, are you happy up in heaven?"
4138,OUT IN THE RAIN,And do the angels part that golden hair
4139,OUT IN THE RAIN,"As tenderly as we? O Saviour dear,"
4140,OUT IN THE RAIN,Thou knowest childhood’s tenderness. Amid
4141,OUT IN THE RAIN,"The care of countless worlds, sometimes descend"
4142,OUT IN THE RAIN,"From thine almighty throne of power, and find"
4143,OUT IN THE RAIN,"That little yellow head, and lay it on thy breast,"
4144,OUT IN THE RAIN,And smooth her brow with thine own pierced hand;
4145,OUT IN THE RAIN,She’ll kiss the wound and try to make it well.
4146,OUT IN THE RAIN,And tell her how we love her memory here;
4147,OUT IN THE RAIN,"And let her sometimes see us, that she may"
4148,OUT IN THE RAIN,"Remember us. O Jesus, we can trust"
4149,OUT IN THE RAIN,Her to thy care; and when we lay us down
4150,OUT IN THE RAIN,"To rest, beside that lonely, little grave,"
4151,OUT IN THE RAIN,Oh! let her meet us with her harp.
4152,OUT IN THE RAIN,God help us both to make that meeting sure!

4168,THE LILY AND THE DEW-DROP,"Falls on the raptured sense so dreamily,"
4169,THE LILY AND THE DEW-DROP,The soul swoons in the tearful clasp of memory.
4170,THE LILY AND THE DEW-DROP,
4171,THE LILY AND THE DEW-DROP,So when an old man hears a harvest song
4172,THE LILY AND THE DEW-DROP,"He used to sing, or smells the new-mown hay,"
4173,THE LILY AND THE DEW-DROP,A host of saddened recollections throng
4174,THE LILY AND THE DEW-DROP,"The dusty chambers of his heart, and play"
4175,THE LILY AND THE DEW-DROP,Upon the cobwebs there a soft Æolian lay.

4190,WRITTEN AFTER HAVING A HEMORRHAGE FROM THE LUNGS,Life bloomed for me as if my path thro’ Eden

4192,WRITTEN AFTER HAVING A HEMORRHAGE FROM THE LUNGS,In many ways my efforts. No dark strife

4201,WRITTEN AFTER HAVING A HEMORRHAGE FROM THE LUNGS,"That I had Genius to encharm the world,"
4202,WRITTEN AFTER HAVING A HEMORRHAGE FROM THE LUNGS,And I looked forward to the loud applause
4203,WRITTEN AFTER HAVING A HEMORRHAGE FROM THE LUNGS,Of nations as a simple thing of time.
4204,WRITTEN AFTER HAVING A HEMORRHAGE FROM THE LUNGS,Of death I thought but as a fright for those
4205,WRITTEN AFTER HAVING A HEMORRHAGE FROM THE LUNGS,Who have no destiny but dying. Mine

4235,WRITTEN AFTER HAVING A HEMORRHAGE FROM THE LUNGS,"The cloud, unfolding snowy depths, disclosed"
4236,WRITTEN AFTER HAVING A HEMORRHAGE FROM THE LUNGS,"The glories of that “House not made with hands,”"
4237,WRITTEN AFTER HAVING A HEMORRHAGE FROM THE LUNGS,"And bending from it, so full of tenderness,"
