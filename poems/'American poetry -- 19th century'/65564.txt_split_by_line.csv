52,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:
53,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,
54,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"No word, no act, no consecrated gift of mine, how great or slight"
55,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"soever it may be, can ever repay the beneficence and love of you to"
56,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,whom I owe life and whatever of prosperity has been granted me.
57,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,
58,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,As my eyes glance in retrospect along the fading perspective of years
59,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"and lose themselves in the dim days of the cradle, and thence to the"
60,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,present look forwards to the distant peaks of hope that rise above
61,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"unknown mists and shadows and horizons, I hear the counseling words"
62,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"of a father, and feel the ever-present touch of a mother’s hand, as"
63,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,both guide me with love into the dim unknown of life. Though I pass
64,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"onwards with a father’s “God-speed,” and a mother’s lingering embrace"
65,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"and loving kiss, and leave you both fondly looking after me, still your"
66,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,presence in my memory is ever a guiding reality that even now directs
67,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,this good right hand of mine to inscribe these dedicatory words of
68,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,filial affection.
69,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,
70,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,If in the days agone I ever seemed unheeding of that counsel of
71,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"a father, and unmindful of that dearest love of a cherished and"
72,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"cherishing mother, I can but say that both that counsel and that love"
73,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,reach through those moulding and shaping years of my life and take hold
74,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,on my heart with a firmness and a gentleness that nothing else of all
75,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,the years can boast.
76,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,
77,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"It is but right and just, therefore, that in these your later days"
78,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,I should likewise be your guide and your stay in so far as my hand
79,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,may let;--that I should reach out my strong young arm and steady the
80,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,tottering years that throng around you.
81,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,
82,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"Withal, if I can afford you even one slight pleasure, it is my heart’s"
83,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"desire so to do. It is, therefore, with somewhat more than filial love"
84,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"that I dedicate this little volume to you, my Father and my Mother,"
85,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"both together my counselor and guide, still mercifully spared to your"
86,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,"children; and in doing so, I can but express the hope that your years"
87,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,may yet be many and happy; that the iris struck by a New Sun from the
88,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,crystals of the whitened and whitening wintry years may be as full of
89,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,beauty and joy as were the early spring blossoms of love and hope that
90,MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:,you pressed to your bosoms in youth.

98,BY THE WAY.,BY THE WAY.
99,BY THE WAY.,
100,BY THE WAY.,
101,BY THE WAY.,As the presentation of these collected verses in their present printed
102,BY THE WAY.,form has been induced largely by the request of many of my former
103,BY THE WAY.,"college students and by the importunities of my most intimate friends,"
104,BY THE WAY.,and as this volume has consequently been prepared chiefly for their
105,BY THE WAY.,"pleasure, it is hoped that those into whose hands the book may fall"
106,BY THE WAY.,are already so well acquainted with the author that the selections
107,BY THE WAY.,themselves need no formal introduction to make them agreeable company
108,BY THE WAY.,and engaging companions.
109,BY THE WAY.,
110,BY THE WAY.,"In justice, I should here say that this collection contains only a"
111,BY THE WAY.,"few out of the vast number of good, bad, and indifferent pieces of"
112,BY THE WAY.,"verse that I have been making at odd hours of a busy life, ever since"
113,BY THE WAY.,"my boyhood, for my own pastime, pleasure, and literary and linguistic"
114,BY THE WAY.,"improvement, with no thought nor distant dream of ever permitting them"
115,BY THE WAY.,thus to invade the domains of the sovereign public.
116,BY THE WAY.,
117,BY THE WAY.,That the little book that thus modestly goes forth will attain either
118,BY THE WAY.,"a large circulation or great popularity I neither expect, nor attempt"
119,BY THE WAY.,to bring about; but that men and women with hearts that love and souls
120,BY THE WAY.,that look above may find much quiet pleasure and satisfaction in the
121,BY THE WAY.,following pages I do sincerely hope.
122,BY THE WAY.,
123,BY THE WAY.,It is neither my desire nor befitting to my work to lay claim to
124,BY THE WAY.,any degree of excellence in the verses herein presented. Quite to
125,BY THE WAY.,"the contrary, I see and regret many defects which I can now neither"
126,BY THE WAY.,"remove nor repair. But, however defective they may be in form or in"
127,BY THE WAY.,"spirit, I have ever thought that little else than the interpretation"
128,BY THE WAY.,"of the relations of the human soul to life, here and hereafter, and"
129,BY THE WAY.,"the presentation of the good, the beautiful, and the true of the human"
130,BY THE WAY.,heart is worthy of serious effort.
131,BY THE WAY.,
132,BY THE WAY.,"As a consequence, most of these pieces are dual in meaning--one, in"
133,BY THE WAY.,"plain view, the reality; the other, less distinct, the finer ideality,"
134,BY THE WAY.,"the reflection, or mirrored image of the first."
135,BY THE WAY.,
136,BY THE WAY.,"It is this second, this finer and often, at first, obscure meaning"
137,BY THE WAY.,"that, in my judgment, is the essential--the preserving salt--of any"
138,BY THE WAY.,"poem. Certainly if not this meaning but the apparent one, the one on"
139,BY THE WAY.,"the surface, is the basis of judgment on these poems, they will fall"
140,BY THE WAY.,far below the estimate accorded that poetry which is deemed worthy of
141,BY THE WAY.,existence.
142,BY THE WAY.,
143,BY THE WAY.,I wish here to return my thanks for the hearty reception accorded the
144,BY THE WAY.,"few selections of the prospectus, and to express the hope that the"
145,BY THE WAY.,completed volume will equal whatever expectations the recipients of the
146,BY THE WAY.,prospectus may have.
147,BY THE WAY.,
148,BY THE WAY.,"Also, I cannot pass without noting the fact that a large share of the"
149,BY THE WAY.,first edition of this volume was engaged nearly six months before it
150,BY THE WAY.,"went to press, even before I had determined what productions I should"
151,BY THE WAY.,"use, and that, too, upon the mere announcement that the publication was"
152,BY THE WAY.,contemplated for the present summer.
153,BY THE WAY.,
154,BY THE WAY.,"I wish, therefore, thus publicly to thank those who have given this"
155,BY THE WAY.,substantial earnest of their appreciation.
156,BY THE WAY.,
157,BY THE WAY.,"Any opinion or criticism, favorable or unfavorable, or any suggestion"
158,BY THE WAY.,"or correction on thought, arrangement, typography, or other point, that"
159,BY THE WAY.,"the reader may see fit to express, is not only invited and encouraged,"
160,BY THE WAY.,but will be most gratefully received and carefully considered.
161,BY THE WAY.,
162,BY THE WAY.,"One word more. If a selection will not bear a second reading, or a"
163,BY THE WAY.,"third, a fourth, or a fiftieth reading; if it does not grow better and"
164,BY THE WAY.,"better at each reading; if it does not lift the soul to a higher plane,"
165,BY THE WAY.,"a nobler aim, a purer life, and a grander view; if at each successive"
166,BY THE WAY.,"reading something does not come out of it and enter the heart, and"
167,BY THE WAY.,"then pass back into the poem again, and thus again and again, each"
168,BY THE WAY.,"beautifying and ennobling the other, like a sunset halo among the"
169,BY THE WAY.,"clouds and the liquid, translucent image thereof in the mirroring lake,"
170,BY THE WAY.,"then it is no true poem, and should be cast aside."
171,BY THE WAY.,
172,BY THE WAY.,The only proof of the excellence of a poem is that it makes the heart
173,BY THE WAY.,"larger and the soul nobler for having read it, and that at each"
174,BY THE WAY.,successive reading both the poem and the reader grow better and better.
175,BY THE WAY.,
176,BY THE WAY.,"Believing, as I do, that poetry is nothing less than the interpretation"
177,BY THE WAY.,of the Divine in the human heart (whether in the mood of tears or of
178,BY THE WAY.,"laughter), I can but hope, in entrusting these “children of the brain”"
179,BY THE WAY.,"to the care of others, that in the heart of each little waif some good"
180,BY THE WAY.,"may be found, some song may be heard, some beauty be revealed, some"
181,BY THE WAY.,experience be verified.

1241,I.,"But flung his arms far up the black’ning height,"
1242,I.,From the quiver of the planets joyously
1243,I.,"Drew forth his arrows, star-tipped, feathery,"

1245,I.,With ten thousand starry-spangled blades of fire.
1246,I.,"Night, wounded by the arrows of the Sun,"

1273,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"On submitting this poem to critics, I find that various ideas are"
1274,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"gleaned. Some take it as a literal description of night and day, or"
1275,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,light and darkness! Others think that it celebrates the victory of
1276,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"truth over error, right over wrong, virtue over vice, or possibly the"
1277,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"triumph of learning over ignorance, or civilization over barbarism."
1278,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"This is not so surprising; for I confess it does, indeed, admit"
1279,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"various interpretations. Some say that in its obscurity, though in"
1280,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"nothing else, it somewhat resembles the work of some great poet."
1281,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,The only consolation that I can squeeze out of all these various
1282,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,opinions is that obscurity and occultness synchronously attend upon
1283,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,and are concomitant with both iconographic delineations and symbolical
1284,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"phraseology. ’Tis _said_ ’tis so,--and so ’tis sad!"

1286,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"“Sing a song o’ six-pence, pocket full of rye, four and twenty"
1287,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"black-birds baked in a pie,” etc., is comparatively meaningless, tho’"
1288,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"pleasing, unless we know what is symbolized. The “pie” is the _day_,"
1289,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,the “four and twenty black-birds” are the twenty-four _hours_ of the
1290,SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.,"_day_, etc., etc. The symbols thus completed give a new beauty to that"

1332,II.,
1333,II.,This may aid somewhat. Too close an interpretation cannot be permitted
1334,II.,in any poem: ’twould make some of the most exquisite poetic thought of
1335,II.,literature ridiculous and nonsensical. The true poetic nature never
1336,II.,needs more in the interpretation of any poem than the title and the
1337,II.,naked poem itself to _suggest_ thoughts and images infinitely more
1338,II.,beautiful than explanation can possibly make them.

1746,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"As the sun arose, and ere, e’en years ere it showed its lower disk,"
1747,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,the family increased most startingly. The whole of their known world
1748,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,was peopled. They developed the resources of their vast little land.
1749,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,They cultivated the soil. They delved in the mines for gold. They
1750,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,carried on commerce with their widely scattered selves. They built
1751,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"homes and cities. Their cities were magnificent, their houses built of"

1757,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"they were a happy, though barbarous people."
1758,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,
1759,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,The sun arose. Men of the present generation had already grown
1760,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"gray-headed, while myriads of their posterity were just starting on"

1771,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,
1772,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,The sun was mid-forenoon. The Family of the Ephemera had grown old
1773,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,and wise. They pointed with vaunting pride to their intelligence and
1774,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"prosperity, to their grand achievements reaching down the long,"
1775,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,fretted colonnades of history and vanishing in the dim perspective of
1776,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"tradition’s mystery. They looked upon all around, beneath, and above"
1777,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"them, and rejoiced that all was for them. Their wise philosophers"
1778,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"pointed to the sun and said, “All for us!” They told and taught how"
1779,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,that great sun had always remained in its present place; for even in
1780,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,the memory of the oldest inhabitants no one had ever known the sun to
1781,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"be in other place than now. Nay, even history knew it not. They said,"
1782,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"however, that there was a tradition, but not authenticated by history"
1783,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"nor by later scientific investigation, that the sun long, long æons ago"
1784,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,had occupied a position nearer the horizon. They showed how and why
1785,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"all things were made for them; how the great toad-stool, towering an"
1786,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"immeasurable distance above them, had been placed on earth for them,"
1787,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"and them alone, and philosophized how it was impossible for another"
1788,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,to exist in the universe. They rejoiced that their little world was
1789,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"created, and endowed with all its richest blessings, for none other"
1790,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"than them. They were a happy people, and prosperous. Their want of"
1791,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,wisdom made them more happy and more prosperous.
1792,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,
1793,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,Centuries came and went. The sun stood in the zenith. So stood the
1794,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,race of Ephemera. Wiser philosophers than those of the mid-forenoon
1795,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"of their existence still pointed toward the great red sun, and said,"
1796,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,“It was always _there_; it was made for _us_!” Crowns crumbled. New
1797,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"nations arose as from chaos, flourished, and died. Others took their"
1798,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,places. Schools had always been tolerated. They were now fostered. They
1799,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,pointed their telescopes toward the mighty fret-work of the toad-stool
1800,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"above them, and computed the number of huge radial beams that supported"
1801,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,its broad outer rim. The students of the universities and colleges
1802,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,delved deep into the lore of their ancestral nations. They studied
1803,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,history; they read their poets; they reasoned and computed with their
1804,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,mathematicians; they looked down into the earth and up into the heavens
1805,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"with their philosophers, and, withdrawing to their own narrow cells,"
1806,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"they said, “All for us, all for us!”"
1807,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,
1808,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"The sun passed the zenith, declining to the west. The race declined!"
1809,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"Still, philosophers said, pointing to the sun, “’Twas alway thus; ’twas"
1810,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,made for us!”
1811,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,
1812,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"They said Time was for them, and them alone. They could not conceive"
1813,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"another similar or a different people. With prophecy, they looked into"
1814,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"the future. They claimed that, also: for a hope and a faith, placed"
1815,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"in their hearts at their creation, had grown and strengthened, that"
1816,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"they should all meet again in another world, a brighter and a better"
1817,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"world, all for them, all for them. The gods, with whom they peopled all"
1818,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"things, watched over and guarded them, and them alone."
1819,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,
1820,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,The sun sank low. The lower limb touched the horizon. With the going
1821,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"down of the sun, the race decayed in its old age. As the last ray of"
1822,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"sun passed over the land of the Ephemera, only two of this strange"
1823,FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.,"Family, wandering hand in hand, old and lone, turned their eyes to the"

2349,BORROWING BRAINS.,And left me as sound and as solid as new!

2996,THROUGH REVERENT EYES.,I fear I do not love; I hold

3098,WHAT IS POETRY?,"words, the poet is both born and made. _Poeta nascitur non fit_--the"
3099,WHAT IS POETRY?,"poet is born, not made--is true in this sense and in no other; for"
3100,WHAT IS POETRY?,"the feelings, the gifts of the poet, are the gifts of every human"
3101,WHAT IS POETRY?,"soul in greater or less degree. Else the proverb is not true, and we"
3102,WHAT IS POETRY?,"must say, _Poeta nascitur et fit_; which would, no doubt, be equally"
3103,WHAT IS POETRY?,"misunderstood. But _Poeta nascitur non fit_ is true; and if, instead of"
3104,WHAT IS POETRY?,"being translated literally, it is rendered in an explanatory way, it"
3105,WHAT IS POETRY?,means simply:--“The poet possesses the same faculties that others do;
3106,WHAT IS POETRY?,but the poetic faculty in him at birth is more highly developed than
3107,WHAT IS POETRY?,"it is in others, and is consequently susceptible of a higher degree of"
3108,WHAT IS POETRY?,cultivation. If the poetic faculty is naturally slight or insignificant
3109,WHAT IS POETRY?,"at birth, no amount of cultivating and polishing can create, or make,"
3110,WHAT IS POETRY?,"a poet of its possessor.” This is the ancient meaning, and the only"
3111,WHAT IS POETRY?,"sensible meaning, the meaning accepted by all who understand the"
3112,WHAT IS POETRY?,subject.
3113,WHAT IS POETRY?,
3114,WHAT IS POETRY?,To see it from a different angle. The true poet has both genius
3115,WHAT IS POETRY?,"and talent--or rather, genius has the poet and compels the poet to"
3116,WHAT IS POETRY?,have talent. Genius is the divine gift; talent is the cultivation.
3117,WHAT IS POETRY?,"Genius--poetic genius--, the highest harmonious union of the feelings,"
3118,WHAT IS POETRY?,"is the part of the poet that is born; talent, the ability to reveal"
3119,WHAT IS POETRY?,"that genius, is the part that is cultivated, or made. Genius is power;"
3120,WHAT IS POETRY?,talent is skill. The man of poetic genius cannot help writing; the man
3121,WHAT IS POETRY?,"of poetic talent can help it, but won’t. That’s the main difference."
3122,WHAT IS POETRY?,
3123,WHAT IS POETRY?,"If you can’t help writing, nine chances out of nine you are a poet,"
3124,WHAT IS POETRY?,and are unconscious of your great power from the simple fact that it
3125,WHAT IS POETRY?,"is natural to you. If you can help writing, don’t write; for you are"
3126,WHAT IS POETRY?,"evidently no poet, though you may have talent, and may believe (very"
3127,WHAT IS POETRY?,likely will) from the unnaturalness of it that you are great.
3128,WHAT IS POETRY?,
3129,WHAT IS POETRY?,The genius which forces the poet to write is the same genius that is
3130,WHAT IS POETRY?,ever reaching out of the poem and beckoning us upwards. Thus much for
3131,WHAT IS POETRY?,the present as to what constitutes the poet.
3132,WHAT IS POETRY?,
3133,WHAT IS POETRY?,Now as to poetry. Though we cannot hope to arrive at the seat of its
3134,WHAT IS POETRY?,mysterious fountain of inspiration and bind its hidden springs of
3135,WHAT IS POETRY?,"immortality, we shall nevertheless, in earnest search, by upward,"
3136,WHAT IS POETRY?,"honest, toilsome flight, at least behold the beauty-embodying mountain"
3137,WHAT IS POETRY?,"heights whence its rivers of eternal glory flow, and whither the soul"
3138,WHAT IS POETRY?,must ever soar to drink of its purest living waters;--waters that
3139,WHAT IS POETRY?,"purify mortality and reflect Divinity, and make the soul bathed in"
3140,WHAT IS POETRY?,"them and drunken of them better know its own vastness, grandeur, and"
3141,WHAT IS POETRY?,divinity.
3142,WHAT IS POETRY?,
3143,WHAT IS POETRY?,Until the soul by this upward flight shall have beheld itself thus
3144,WHAT IS POETRY?,"divinely reflected in the immortal streams of poetry, it can never feel"
3145,WHAT IS POETRY?,"and know its own vastness, its infinitude. Likewise, until it shall"
3146,WHAT IS POETRY?,"have bathed in and drunk of these mighty purifying waters of goodness,"
3147,WHAT IS POETRY?,"truth, and beauty, the soul can never know the divinity and immortality"
3148,WHAT IS POETRY?,"of poetry. Thus, if the soul know not the one, it cannot know the"
3149,WHAT IS POETRY?,other; the two knowledges are reciprocal.
3150,WHAT IS POETRY?,
3151,WHAT IS POETRY?,It may be said æsthetically and as nearly scientifically as it can well
3152,WHAT IS POETRY?,"be said, that poetry is naturally rhythmical and metrical imaginative"
3153,WHAT IS POETRY?,language interpreting the Divine in the human heart. This defines at
3154,WHAT IS POETRY?,"once, as nearly as can well be defined in a single sentence, the Form"
3155,WHAT IS POETRY?,"(or mechanism), the Spirit, and the Mission of poetry."
3156,WHAT IS POETRY?,
3157,WHAT IS POETRY?,"Form we can define and anatomize, just as we can define and anatomize"
3158,WHAT IS POETRY?,"the human body. The spirit of poetry we cannot define and anatomize,"
3159,WHAT IS POETRY?,just as we cannot define and anatomize the human soul. Form alone
3160,WHAT IS POETRY?,"cannot constitute a poem, just as body alone cannot constitute a man."
3161,WHAT IS POETRY?,Spirit alone may constitute poetry (in the abstract) though not a
3162,WHAT IS POETRY?,"concrete poem, just as the soul alone may constitute life though not a"
3163,WHAT IS POETRY?,living man. Just as both body and soul are necessary to constitute a
3164,WHAT IS POETRY?,"man, so also both form and spirit are necessary to constitute any of"
3165,WHAT IS POETRY?,"his visible art-creations, as a poem."
3166,WHAT IS POETRY?,
3167,WHAT IS POETRY?,
3168,FORM.,FORM.
3169,FORM.,
3170,FORM.,The requisites of form are rhythm and metre. The accidents of form are
3171,FORM.,"rhyme (consonance), assonance, stanza, alliteration, onomatopœia, etc.,"
3172,FORM.,etc.
3173,FORM.,
3174,FORM.,"Rhythm has to do with the kind of feet in a line, while metre has to do"
3175,FORM.,with the number of feet in a line. Rhythm corresponds with the regular
3176,FORM.,"rise and fall of the waves of the sea, each wave-length being counted"
3177,FORM.,"a poetic foot. Metre corresponds with the swell of the sea, composed"
3178,FORM.,"of several successive waves. Thus metre is, after all, a kind of"
3179,FORM.,"rhythm,--the larger ebb and flow of rhythm."
3180,FORM.,
3181,FORM.,"The accidents of form, such as rhyme, stanza, alliteration, etc.,"
3182,FORM.,"we find worthily and advantageously used in much true poetry,"
3183,FORM.,as well as worthlessly used in the tawdry puppet-shows of mere
3184,FORM.,"mechanicians;--those persons who, having nothing to say, yet attempting"
3185,FORM.,"to say something, mistake rhyme for sense, a tickling jingle for"
3186,FORM.,"meaning, their desire to create for the creative power. They do not"
3187,FORM.,"rightly read nor well heed the trite epigrammatic precept, “When you"
3188,FORM.,"have nothing to say, say it.”"
3189,FORM.,
3190,FORM.,"But these accidents of form, I say, are sometimes material aids to the"
3191,FORM.,"thought; indeed, always are when used not for their own sakes but for"
3192,FORM.,"the meaning’s sake. Notwithstanding this fact, many of our greatest"
3193,FORM.,"poems, such as Paradise Lost and others on the epic order, as well as"
3194,FORM.,"many not epic, lack these accidents either wholly or in part."
3195,FORM.,
3196,FORM.,"On the other hand, rhythm and metre are found in all poetic forms, and"
3197,FORM.,are the only two elements of the form of poetry that are thus found.
3198,FORM.,"Hence, rhythm and metre are not only essentials but they are the only"
3199,FORM.,"essentials of form, and constitute the complete body in which the"
3200,FORM.,"spirit of poetry naturally and inevitably clothes itself. They are,"
3201,FORM.,"therefore, just as necessary to poetry in its concrete or visible forms"
3202,FORM.,as the spirit is.
3203,FORM.,
3204,FORM.,"But since rhythm and metre are thus essential to a poem, it is the"
3205,FORM.,common custom to call anything poetry that has this external appearance
3206,FORM.,of the poetic.
3207,FORM.,
3208,FORM.,This is a misapplication of terms. There is so much trash masquerading
3209,FORM.,in the poetic garb that this misapplication inevitably throws ridicule
3210,FORM.,upon true poetry.
3211,FORM.,
3212,FORM.,"Rhythm, when carried to excess and when used not for the meaning’s"
3213,FORM.,"sake, the feeling’s sake, but for the rhythm’s sake alone, becomes"
3214,FORM.,simply jingle; quite invariably a rhyming jingle at that.
3215,FORM.,
3216,FORM.,"Metre, in company with rhythm and rhyme, is often diverted from its"
3217,FORM.,true purpose and used solely to jiggle some fact or some epigram into
3218,FORM.,"the memory, as illustrated by “Thirty days,” etc., and by all other"
3219,FORM.,"didactic metrical arrangements, as mentioned farther on."
3220,FORM.,
3221,FORM.,But rhymes and jingles and metrical arrangements are not poetry. They
3222,FORM.,"are simply members of the form, the dancing legs and arms of the"
3223,FORM.,"body, sometimes possessed of life with an indwelling guiding spirit,"
3224,FORM.,and sometimes whittled out of wood and set in motion by an inspiring
3225,FORM.,"string. These senseless puppets, or jumping-jacks, sometimes, indeed"
3226,FORM.,"often, tickle the mob by their lively antics; but the great final"
3227,FORM.,judgment of humanity relegates them to the rubbish-heap and forgets
3228,FORM.,their ephemeral and unlovely existence.
3229,FORM.,
3230,FORM.,"It is, I say, a misnomer to dignify such by the name of poetry. The"
3231,FORM.,"proper name is verse. Whatever is rhythmical and metrical, whether it"
3232,FORM.,"has any of the accidents of form or not, is verse. Hence, all poetry is"
3233,FORM.,"verse, but not all verse is poetry. Indeed, not one ten-thousandth part"
3234,FORM.,"of verse is poetry; for the requisite of verse is simply form,--the"
3235,FORM.,body into which the spirit must enter ere it becomes poetry. To
3236,FORM.,"illustrate,--"
3237,FORM.,
3238,FORM.,"“Thirty days hath September,"
3239,FORM.,"April, June, and November,” etc.,"
3240,FORM.,
3241,FORM.,has the form of poetry without the slightest touch of the poetic
3242,FORM.,"spirit; thus constituting verse, simple and pure. It requires no"
3243,FORM.,"penetration to perceive that it is not poetry, though I doubt not that"
3244,FORM.,nine hundred ninety-nine out of every thousand have called that stanza
3245,FORM.,in the usual loose way “a verse of poetry.”
3246,FORM.,
3247,FORM.,"But it is not only not poetry, but it is also not a verse, though it is"
3248,FORM.,"_verse_; for a verse is but one line of the poetic form, while _verse_"
3249,FORM.,is the form itself. It is not poetry because it has merely form without
3250,FORM.,spirit. As well call the dead body a man (which indeed we sometimes do
3251,FORM.,in the same loose way) as call such by the name of poetry.
3252,FORM.,
3253,FORM.,"But the body of a man without the soul is a dead man; that is, not a"
3254,FORM.,"man at all. So also the body of one of his visible art-creations, as of"
3255,FORM.,"poetry, without the spirit, is dead art, a dead poem;--no poem at all."
3256,FORM.,
3257,FORM.,"Is it not so? Only look at our thousands of dailies, weeklies,"
3258,FORM.,"monthlies, quarterlies, and whatnotlies, where millions of these"
3259,FORM.,"poetry-bodies lie buried, smelling too much of mortality; then turn to"
3260,FORM.,"the time-glorified tomes of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Burns, Milton, Homer,"
3261,FORM.,"Virgil, and their eternal co-endurers for a breath of heaven. Let this"
3262,FORM.,be the final answer.
3263,FORM.,
3264,FORM.,"Rhythm, it may be said (taking it beyond the realms of concrete"
3265,FORM.,"poetry), is the music of Nature. It is Nature’s natural expression, if"
3266,FORM.,"I may so speak. All her motions are rhythmical, have ripples and waves;"
3267,FORM.,even at rest her forms lie in the rhythmic order.
3268,FORM.,
3269,FORM.,"Wherever billows beat the crags, or ripples kiss the sands; wherever"
3270,FORM.,"winds go soughing through the pines, or zephyrs toss a curl; wherever"
3271,FORM.,"snows may drive to drifts, or wheat-fields billow green and gold;"
3272,FORM.,"wherever drifting clouds, or dreaming skies, or bordering trees are"
3273,FORM.,"hung dependent on the smooth lake’s waters; wherever birds may sing,"
3274,FORM.,"or flowers bloom, or rivers run; wherever thunders wake, or hills and"
3275,FORM.,"valleys sleep;--there is rhythm, there is music, there is Nature’s"
3276,FORM.,perfect harmony.
3277,FORM.,
3278,FORM.,"Nor is it different in man, Nature’s crown triumphant. In throes of"
3279,FORM.,pain or woe’s distress; in joys that iris happy tears; in sorrow’s
3280,FORM.,mournful cadences; in laughter’s lilting melody; in peace and
3281,FORM.,"bounteous plenty, or in war and woeful famine; in love or hate, or"
3282,FORM.,"life or death;--through all of man’s existence, there again is rhythm,"
3283,FORM.,"Passion’s only melody, the music of the soul."
3284,FORM.,
3285,FORM.,"True, in the calms of life, although ’tis there, we little feel this"
3286,FORM.,"rhythm,--this adjusting process by which man inevitably seeks to put"
3287,FORM.,the heart in tune while here for higher harmonies hereafter. But when
3288,FORM.,"the soul’s deep feeling is aroused, then listen to its rhythmic ebb and"
3289,FORM.,"flow like gently wimpling waters or like the surging beat, beat, beat"
3290,FORM.,upon the sands.
3291,FORM.,
3292,FORM.,Hear the lonesome cadences of sorrow crying up to heaven; listen to
3293,FORM.,the joyousness that tinkles through the melody of laughter; hark the
3294,FORM.,"sharp, quick, fierce beat in the surge of righteous anger; hear the"
3295,FORM.,"tender, mellow music from the soothing lips of Love,--divine, immortal"
3296,FORM.,Love--and dream of other worlds and better things as you listen thus
3297,FORM.,transported.
3298,FORM.,
3299,FORM.,"When these passions of the soul would express themselves in words,"
3300,FORM.,"the words, too, fashioned by the spirit that enters them, must"
3301,FORM.,"inevitably move in rhythm, and, in the greater wave-lengths, fit"
3302,FORM.,"themselves to metre. This feeling, or passion, that enters rhythmic"
3303,FORM.,words--that unswervingly seeks rhythm as the only form in which it
3304,FORM.,can express itself--is the spirit of poetry. Thus it is that poetry
3305,FORM.,comes about; thus it is that poetry is spontaneous and not the result
3306,FORM.,of long meditation; thus it is that poetry is the natural outlet of
3307,FORM.,highly-wrought or great feeling.

3311,SPIRIT.,
3312,SPIRIT.,"As in man, so in all art of man, the soul within fashions the body"
3313,SPIRIT.,without. True beauty is soul-beauty; that beauty that is in the heart
3314,SPIRIT.,"and is felt by the heart, without which there can be no physical beauty."
3315,SPIRIT.,
3316,SPIRIT.,"Whatever in the world is beautiful, is beautiful just in proportion"
3317,SPIRIT.,"to the beauty of the soul that sees it. Thus if we would find beauty,"
3318,SPIRIT.,we must first have it. The white-flecked blue of the skies of June;
3319,SPIRIT.,the wren or peewee pouring fourth its perfume-drunken melodies from
3320,SPIRIT.,among the apple-blossoms; the stretch of plain or towering height
3321,SPIRIT.,"of mountain; the scenes of hill or valley, wood or meadow, lake or"
3322,SPIRIT.,river; the Apollo Belvedere; the great Transfiguration; Paradise
3323,SPIRIT.,Lost;--nature’s various forms and reproductions--have no beauty to
3324,SPIRIT.,"the heart whose cavities are empty. But to the full soul, the soul of"
3325,SPIRIT.,"beauty, they are perpetual springs of life, where Divinity is ever"
3326,SPIRIT.,"mirrored forth; for the soul gives what it gets, and gets what it"
3327,SPIRIT.,"gives, and the getting is proportioned to the giving. Give, and we get;"
3328,SPIRIT.,"keep, and we lose."
3329,SPIRIT.,
3330,SPIRIT.,"But what is it in an Apollo, a Transfiguration, a Paradise Lost that"
3331,SPIRIT.,feeds this soul-hunger; that possesses this beauty?--The marble of the
3332,SPIRIT.,"Apollo? Hard by lies the rough, unchiseled Parian marble; but it has"
3333,SPIRIT.,no beauty.--The painted canvas of the Transfiguration? Sitting before
3334,SPIRIT.,"it, there are yearly hundreds of canvases and brushes and paints and"
3335,SPIRIT.,"paintings; but they lack the beauty.--The words, the rhythm, the metre,"
3336,SPIRIT.,"the music of Paradise Lost? Millions of productions, from musty tomes"
3337,SPIRIT.,in the British Museum to the upper left-hand corner of the “patent
3338,SPIRIT.,"inside” of a newspaper, have all these; but no beauty."
3339,SPIRIT.,
3340,SPIRIT.,What then? That same indefinable something which in man we call
3341,SPIRIT.,"the soul, and in art, the spirit; that which the admiring soul"
3342,SPIRIT.,instinctively feels and recognizes.
3343,SPIRIT.,
3344,SPIRIT.,"Had the sculptor never touched his chisel to the marble, nor the"
3345,SPIRIT.,"painter his brush to the canvas, nor the poet his pen to the paper,"
3346,SPIRIT.,"that same spirit, yet not bodied, would have existed within his own"
3347,SPIRIT.,"soul, but never would have been beheld by others. To be seen by other"
3348,SPIRIT.,"eyes, it must needs take on a visible body, a concrete form, in which"
3349,SPIRIT.,it shall dwell.
3350,SPIRIT.,
3351,SPIRIT.,"Thus all forms of Nature and all forms of Art, whatsoever, are the"
3352,SPIRIT.,mere bodying expressions of the spirit that inhabits them. Form is
3353,SPIRIT.,"necessary, but only as a medium through which the spirit may reveal"
3354,SPIRIT.,itself visibly.
3355,SPIRIT.,
3356,SPIRIT.,"The intuitive and unconscious recognition of this principle, that the"
3357,SPIRIT.,"soul within fashions the body it inhabits,--the grandest principle of"
3358,SPIRIT.,"all God’s great laws, the foundation of them all, illimitable as the"
3359,SPIRIT.,immortal Giver--is the door-way through which he who thus recognizes
3360,SPIRIT.,must inevitably enter Nature and Art to enjoy the full communion of the
3361,SPIRIT.,"soul within, and to interpret the beauties of that soul’s divinity to"
3362,SPIRIT.,us.
3363,SPIRIT.,
3364,SPIRIT.,"He who thus enters is possessed of genius. In other words, he has a"
3365,SPIRIT.,"great soul and lives close to Nature’s heart. We of lesser genius,"
3366,SPIRIT.,or of less loving souls (for a great soul is one that loves greatly)
3367,SPIRIT.,commune with the indwelling spirit less freely. If we approach Nature
3368,SPIRIT.,or Art consciously and try to unlock some side-door by the key of the
3369,SPIRIT.,"intellect, we shall probably find only cast-off garments; nay, many of"
3370,SPIRIT.,us may find that the door will not open and we must content ourselves
3371,SPIRIT.,"with a peep through the key-hole. Indeed, do not the multitude behold"
3372,SPIRIT.,"the elegant structures of Nature and Art wonderingly for but a moment,"
3373,SPIRIT.,"without even so much as attempting the key-hole, and then plod on,"
3374,SPIRIT.,unconscious that there is an indwelling soul that has thus fashioned
3375,SPIRIT.,its earthly home?
3376,SPIRIT.,
3377,SPIRIT.,This same great foundation-principle of Nature is likewise the
3378,SPIRIT.,"fundamental law of poetry and of all other art. For art, at best, is"
3379,SPIRIT.,nature wrought by man. What else can it be? It is fashioned by simply
3380,SPIRIT.,"a lesser Divinity, the soul of man, consequently less perfectly, and"
3381,SPIRIT.,"follows the same law. Or better yet, art is nature wrought through the"
3382,SPIRIT.,instrumentality of man by the great Divinity that works in him. Art
3383,SPIRIT.,is simply a name used to designate a specific manifestation or kind
3384,SPIRIT.,"of nature;--that kind that comes through man, and has, not life, but"
3385,SPIRIT.,"spirit; not life, but the picture, the show, the mirrored image of"
3386,SPIRIT.,"life: a sort of record of the soul, and a lamp for its future guidance."
3387,SPIRIT.,
3388,SPIRIT.,"He who, by means of rhythmic words inspirited, can paint this picture,"
3389,SPIRIT.,"represent this show, mirror this image of life, historicize this"
3390,SPIRIT.,"record of the soul, light this lamp and hold it above the heads of the"
3391,SPIRIT.,"trampling ages for the guidance of humanity, is the great poet."
3392,SPIRIT.,
3393,SPIRIT.,Just in proportion to the greatness of such a soul will be the spirit
3394,SPIRIT.,that imbues his creations. It cannot create a new form unless it first
3395,SPIRIT.,implants some germ from its own spiritual self. Not only must there
3396,SPIRIT.,"be the spirit as the prime essential of poetry, the soul within that"
3397,SPIRIT.,"fashions the rhythmical and metrical form it inhabits, but that spirit"
3398,SPIRIT.,must partake of that divinity that is in every human heart;--that
3399,SPIRIT.,"divine flower, deep-rooted in the soil of God, sometimes blossoming to"
3400,SPIRIT.,"an angel-image, sometimes painting the glories of heaven on its petals,"
3401,SPIRIT.,sometimes breathing its deepest-drawn perfumes up from its muse-beloved
3402,SPIRIT.,blooms to the throne above.
3403,SPIRIT.,
3404,SPIRIT.,"Would the soul create a statue, it must see “an angel in that marble”"
3405,SPIRIT.,"ere it give the angel form; would it paint a picture, it must behold"
3406,SPIRIT.,within itself the transfiguration ere it live transfigured on the
3407,SPIRIT.,"canvas; would it write a poem, it must be a paradise of eternal love"
3408,SPIRIT.,and beauty ere it breathe immortal glory into words.
3409,SPIRIT.,
3410,SPIRIT.,"It is this soul within that comes out of the maker of the statue,"
3411,SPIRIT.,"the maker of the picture, the maker of the melody, the maker of the"
3412,SPIRIT.,"poem, and enters his creations, that distinguishes true art from mere"
3413,SPIRIT.,mechanism of art.
3414,SPIRIT.,
3415,SPIRIT.,"It is this same soul within that renders the artist, not a chiseler of"
3416,SPIRIT.,"stone, a painter of canvas, a placer of notes, a rhymer of words, but a"
3417,SPIRIT.,"maker, a creator, in his own lesser realm of nature."
3418,SPIRIT.,
3419,SPIRIT.,"It is this same intangible soul, just within yet just beyond the touch"
3420,SPIRIT.,of our finger-tips as we reach out farther and farther into the dim
3421,SPIRIT.,"unknown, this same indefinable spirit of beauty, shining through the"
3422,SPIRIT.,"form that it inhabits, permeating it inscrutably, that somehow passes"
3423,SPIRIT.,"out of the poem into the heart of the admirer, then slips out of his"
3424,SPIRIT.,"heart into the poem again, and so on and on, again and again, ever"
3425,SPIRIT.,lifting the admiring soul as the poem itself is lifted higher still and
3426,SPIRIT.,ever higher.

3450,MISSION.,
3451,MISSION.,"In order to do this, we must naturally refer to the human mind, since"
3452,MISSION.,thence poetry is brought forth and there it is perceived.
3453,MISSION.,
3454,MISSION.,"There are three great divisions of the mind; namely, Intellect,"
3455,MISSION.,"Sensibilities, or Feelings, and Will."
3456,MISSION.,
3457,MISSION.,The intellect is that power of the mind by which we think and know. The
3458,MISSION.,"sensibilities, or feelings, constitute that power of the mind by which"
3459,MISSION.,we feel. The will is that power of the mind by which we resolve to do
3460,MISSION.,or not to do. These explanations are sufficient for our present purpose.
3461,MISSION.,
3462,MISSION.,"Therefore, whatever furnishes food for the intellect, the knowing-power"
3463,MISSION.,"of the mind, must be of the nature of knowledge, didactic. Whatever"
3464,MISSION.,ministers to the feelings must waken emotion. Whatever gives action to
3465,MISSION.,the will must rouse resolution.
3466,MISSION.,
3467,MISSION.,All literature is for the mind. But since there are three departments
3468,MISSION.,"of the mind, and since literature is produced by and for the mind,"
3469,MISSION.,there must naturally be three divisions of literature that each
3470,MISSION.,"mental power may receive sustenance. That is, there should be that"
3471,MISSION.,literature for the intellect in which knowledge predominates. For
3472,MISSION.,"the sensibilities, there should be that literature in which feeling,"
3473,MISSION.,"emotion, is the primary and essential element. For the will, there"
3474,MISSION.,should be that literature that has for its chief end the rousing of
3475,MISSION.,resolution.
3476,MISSION.,
3477,MISSION.,"On examination of the literary products of the world, we find that"
3478,MISSION.,"this philosophy is sustained. For the intellect, we have treatises (as"
3479,MISSION.,"on the sciences, mathematics, etc.), histories, biographies, novels,"
3480,MISSION.,"romances, essays, etc., etc. The primary object of these is to furnish"
3481,MISSION.,knowledge; to satisfy the intellect. They are in the highest sense
3482,MISSION.,"didactic, although, of course, just as the literature for each faculty"
3483,MISSION.,"does, they incidentally furnish some food for the other powers."
3484,MISSION.,
3485,MISSION.,This intellective literature is the kind that is most largely
3486,MISSION.,"cultivated at the present. In fact, it is cultivated almost to the"
3487,MISSION.,exclusion of the other two.
3488,MISSION.,
3489,MISSION.,"For the will, we have sermons, lectures, orations, speeches, addresses,"
3490,MISSION.,"harangues, etc.; a class of literature that is small when compared with"
3491,MISSION.,the preceding. These two departments of the mind monopolize the whole
3492,MISSION.,domain of prose.
3493,MISSION.,
3494,MISSION.,"That other department of literature, in which feeling is the dominating"
3495,MISSION.,"and pervading principle, must, by its very nature, act upon that same"
3496,MISSION.,"power of the mind that produced it; namely, the sensibilities."
3497,MISSION.,
3498,MISSION.,"Poetry is the literature of feeling, and consequently finds its"
3499,MISSION.,"province here. It is the mission of poetry, therefore, as suggested"
3500,MISSION.,"by the latter part of the definition, to minister to the feelings, to"
3501,MISSION.,interpret the Divine in the human heart. It is this that all writers on
3502,MISSION.,the subject and that all poets mean when they say it is the mission of
3503,MISSION.,poetry to give pleasure.
3504,MISSION.,
3505,MISSION.,But what shall be the limit of that word “pleasure”? Herein lies the
3506,MISSION.,"chief cause of great differences of opinion, especially with those who"
3507,MISSION.,"hold that there is such a thing as didactic poetry. Or rather, what"
3508,MISSION.,is the true meaning of “pleasure” as thus used? The very essence of
3509,MISSION.,"pleasure, as opposed to pain, is that it gratify some emotion and set"
3510,MISSION.,it at perfect rest.
3511,MISSION.,
3512,MISSION.,What emotions when gratified are at perfect rest? The answer at once
3513,MISSION.,"forces itself upon us, only the better emotions. That poetry does"
3514,MISSION.,"minister to and satisfy the higher and nobler feelings, and that what"
3515,MISSION.,"does not do this is not poetry, even the meanest heart that it touches"
3516,MISSION.,fully knows.
3517,MISSION.,
3518,MISSION.,"The attempted gratification of hate, or of any desire whatsoever to"
3519,MISSION.,"give pain to any one, as illustrated in Pope’s _Dunciad_, Dryden’s"
3520,MISSION.,"_Absalom and Achitophel_, Butler’s _Hudibras_, Byron’s _English Bards"
3521,MISSION.,"and Scotch Reviewers_, and all such, never sets the mind of the writer"
3522,MISSION.,"at rest, nor gives enjoyment to the reader. Indeed, who now ever reads"
3523,MISSION.,"these, the world’s greatest illustrations of witty bitterness and"
3524,MISSION.,"venom, couched in verse and unjustifiably designated as poetry?"
3525,MISSION.,
3526,MISSION.,"These are accounted “great works.” But who, let me ask, ever reads any"
3527,MISSION.,"of these “great works,” or ever heard of them, except in some text on"
3528,MISSION.,"Literature? Or, having read them, who loves them, or their authors for"
3529,MISSION.,"having written them? None. No, not one."
3530,MISSION.,
3531,MISSION.,"On the other hand, who has not read some of the noblest works of"
3532,MISSION.,"Shakespeare, Burns, Milton, Tennyson, Longfellow, Bryant, Lowell,"
3533,MISSION.,"Whittier, Holmes? And who does not feel nobler for having read, and who"
3534,MISSION.,does not hold these authors shrined in his heart of hearts for having
3535,MISSION.,written? Is not this proof enough that it is the mission of poetry to
3536,MISSION.,minister only to the higher emotions?
3537,MISSION.,
3538,MISSION.,"After all, hate is merely the negative of love; simply the absence of"
3539,MISSION.,"the better emotion, a void, an ache, a pain. All attempts to gratify"
3540,MISSION.,it only make it stronger--or rather drive the better emotion farther
3541,MISSION.,"away--as illustrated by the cases of Pope, Dryden, Byron, and their"
3542,MISSION.,fellows in revenge and bitterness wherever we find them. No one ever
3543,MISSION.,"felt better or nobler or happier for gratifying a hate, for doing"
3544,MISSION.,"a bad deed, or for giving pain to a fellow-mortal’s feelings. The"
3545,MISSION.,"ever-accusing conscience, if he but listen, will never permit him to"
3546,MISSION.,say in his heart that such gratification has given him pleasure.
3547,MISSION.,
3548,MISSION.,"If, then, it is the mission of poetry to give pleasure, no matter"
3549,MISSION.,whether its interpretation of the Divine in the human heart be by tears
3550,MISSION.,"or by laughter, its ministration necessarily must be to the immortal"
3551,MISSION.,part of man.
3552,MISSION.,
3553,MISSION.,"In the light of all this, therefore, without further argument, it is"
3554,MISSION.,"clear and conclusive that all verse that is sarcastic, satiric, etc.,"
3555,MISSION.,"such as that of Swift, Butler, Pope, Gay, Prior, and their hosts, is"
3556,MISSION.,not poetry.
3557,MISSION.,
3558,MISSION.,But what of the didactic? Whatever has the primary object of teaching
3559,MISSION.,"delivers its treasures to the keeping of the intellect. If, therefore,"
3560,MISSION.,"verse aims primarily to teach, but ministers to the sensibilities only"
3561,MISSION.,"incidentally, it is not true poetry. Poetry does not teach nor preach"
3562,MISSION.,nor argue nor discuss. Those are the provinces of prose. Poems and
3563,MISSION.,"roses must not teach; they must bloom. Their breath delights us, their"
3564,MISSION.,"suggestions, their reflections of a Divinity that is above them, lifts"
3565,MISSION.,"us--God knows why! The cry of pain, the romping laugh of children at"
3566,MISSION.,"play, the pathos of death, the touch of the hand or the lips of the"
3567,MISSION.,one we love needs no argument to fill the heart with uncontrollable
3568,MISSION.,"emotion. These are the sweetest of the poet’s themes, and he has but"
3569,MISSION.,to reveal them without argument as they are experienced in the heart.
3570,MISSION.,Argument kills them. Just in proportion to the didactic character of
3571,MISSION.,"verse the path of poetry is departed from, and the realm of prose"
3572,MISSION.,invaded. You cannot find a solitary purely didactic piece of verse the
3573,MISSION.,meaning of which could not be better expressed in prose. Not so with
3574,MISSION.,true poetry. That cannot be expressed in any other way.
3575,MISSION.,
3576,MISSION.,The most illustrious types of the didactic are to be found in the
3577,MISSION.,"“Artificial School,” at the head of which stands Pope. When we cut out"
3578,MISSION.,"the satiric and the sarcastic and all ill-feeling verse, as we see we"
3579,MISSION.,"must, and then the didactic, as we are forced by reason and logic to"
3580,MISSION.,"do, how much real poetry do we have left in this “School” so well named"
3581,MISSION.,"“Artificial”? How much is there left that makes the heart feel larger,"
3582,MISSION.,"nobler, better, and gives it new fountains of life? Only a rare gem"
3583,MISSION.,now and then in the form of a single felicitous line or happily wedded
3584,MISSION.,"couplet. Then, when we cut this same kind of verse out of the whole"
3585,MISSION.,"literature of the world, and also that other kind, already spoken of at"
3586,MISSION.,"length, in which there is merely spiritless poetic form as its chief"
3587,MISSION.,"element, how much real poetry and how many real poets does the world"
3588,MISSION.,"possess? Comparatively, only a few poets, the world’s great, and a few"
3589,MISSION.,of their works--those that have already stood the test of time and that
3590,MISSION.,"still stand the only true test of good literature, that it inspires the"
3591,MISSION.,heart with noble feelings and lofty purposes--can be placed in the list.
3592,MISSION.,
3593,MISSION.,But enough on the kinds of verse.
3594,MISSION.,
3595,MISSION.,Another question concerning pleasure arising from poetry presents
3596,MISSION.,itself. “Violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph
3597,MISSION.,"die.” The poetic, by its very nature, is violent. Consequently, the"
3598,MISSION.,mind cannot long imbibe its intoxicating draughts. A little at a
3599,MISSION.,time is exhilarating and invigorating; but an over-dose deadens the
3600,MISSION.,"sensibilities, and often creates a serious dislike for the poetic and a"
3601,MISSION.,consequent unconscious restlessness of longing for the satisfaction of
3602,MISSION.,the higher emotions that prose can never furnish.
3603,MISSION.,
3604,MISSION.,"The mind cannot long endure extreme exertion, just as the body cannot."
3605,MISSION.,"Poetry requires extreme exertion of the sensibilities, consequently"
3606,MISSION.,its duration should be short that its full delight and pleasure may be
3607,MISSION.,"enjoyed. Since this is so, every poem, by the very nature of the mind,"
3608,MISSION.,must be brief. Who would live in a conservatory of roses where their
3609,MISSION.,"sweet scent, most delightful at first breath, soon becomes sickening?"
3610,MISSION.,Or who would hold even one of those odorous blooms to the nose for
3611,MISSION.,"long? Who, on the other hand, does not delight in an occasional sip of"
3612,MISSION.,the scent of a bursting rose-bud? And who does not find new delight at
3613,MISSION.,"each successive draught, and regret that the petals that breathe this"
3614,MISSION.,"odor for us, alas! must fade and fall?"
3615,MISSION.,
3616,MISSION.,"I believe most profoundly with Poe that, from the standpoint of the"
3617,MISSION.,"mind that produces and the mind that perceives and enjoys it, there is"
3618,MISSION.,"no such thing as a long poem. I shall go farther, and say, not only"
3619,MISSION.,"that a poem must be short, but that it must be lyrical. This gets us"
3620,MISSION.,back to nature. Historically the first literature of every nation is
3621,MISSION.,"poetry, and that poetry is invariably lyrical; indeed, even inevitably"
3622,MISSION.,"so. In every nation, we find it is many centuries before these lyrics"
3623,MISSION.,of the nation are gathered up and finally strung on the thread of
3624,MISSION.,"narrative, thus making the Epic. From the lyric, all imaginable forms"
3625,MISSION.,have been brought forth by ingenious poets of later day. The bard
3626,MISSION.,"of simple days lived, not close to nature’s intellect, but close to"
3627,MISSION.,"nature’s heart. Burns was the best poet of modern days, because he did"
3628,MISSION.,"the same; consequently, he is always lyrical when he is natural."
3629,MISSION.,
3630,MISSION.,"Shall we then say that the Æneid, the Odyssey, the Iliad, the"
3631,MISSION.,"Canterbury Tales, the Faery Queen, or Paradise Lost is each one poem?"
3632,MISSION.,"Viewed as I have just remarked, and that (in its relation to the mind)"
3633,MISSION.,"is the only true way to view a poem, none of these is a single poem."
3634,MISSION.,Each is made up of a number of poems--gems strung on the thread of a
3635,MISSION.,common subject;--roses in a common conservatory.
3636,MISSION.,
3637,MISSION.,"Indeed, the whole of Homer is simply a collection of a great number"
3638,MISSION.,"of short poems--lyrics, indeed, they were--sung by many authors for"
3639,MISSION.,"centuries, and finally gathered up and pieced together to form books"
3640,MISSION.,"and volumes. Each one of the Canterbury Tales contains many poems,"
3641,MISSION.,strung together to form one necklace of jewels.
3642,MISSION.,
3643,MISSION.,I ask any one to sit down and read any of these great and wonderful
3644,MISSION.,"works continuously one day, as he might prose, and comprehend what he"
3645,MISSION.,is reading. Not even one book of Paradise Lost can be _read_ (in the
3646,MISSION.,true sense of that word) at a single sitting. There are too many poems
3647,MISSION.,"in it, and the consequent demands upon the mind are too great for that."
3648,MISSION.,Possibly this very fact had somewhat to do with calling forth the
3649,MISSION.,"unjust remark from Waller concerning that great epic, “If its length be"
3650,MISSION.,not considered as a merit it hath no other.”
3651,MISSION.,
3652,MISSION.,"Since a poem must be brief, naturally, and for the same cause, it"
3653,MISSION.,"should be read judiciously and at intervals, if it is to be appreciated"
3654,MISSION.,"and enjoyed, just as the rose must be smelled only occasionally. We"
3655,MISSION.,cannot read poetry as we can prose; it won’t let us. By their very
3656,MISSION.,natures they demand a different manner of reading. One can read prose
3657,MISSION.,"continuously, hour after hour, without seriously wearying the mind,"
3658,MISSION.,"for the simple reason that, in prose, thought is not condensed, but"
3659,MISSION.,"is spread through a long series of sentences. Moreover, the thought"
3660,MISSION.,"is not, as a rule, simply suggested, but is fully expressed, leaving"
3661,MISSION.,"the mind in a comparative state of passive receptivity, with but"
3662,MISSION.,little active labor to perform in order to comprehend the meaning.
3663,MISSION.,"On the other hand, poetry always expresses thought in condensed form"
3664,MISSION.,"and suggests many fold more than it expresses. Consequently, a single"
3665,MISSION.,stanza or even a single line may sometimes require as much attention
3666,MISSION.,"for the full comprehension of its meaning and suggestion, as a whole"
3667,MISSION.,page of ordinary prose.
3668,MISSION.,
3669,MISSION.,"We must plant the poem in the heart and give it time to grow, as we"
3670,MISSION.,"plant the flower-seeds in the soil. Finally, as the growing flower"
3671,MISSION.,"bursts into bloom, so must the poem blossom from the heart into its"
3672,MISSION.,full perfection and beauty.
3673,MISSION.,
3674,MISSION.,"Fully to appreciate that flower’s beauty, it must not be dissected and"
3675,MISSION.,analyzed by glass and scalpel. Did Burns go botanizing the daisy? Need
3676,MISSION.,we then go botanizing these flowers and blossoms of the soul of man? He
3677,MISSION.,"who does it tries to force the intellect to do what the emotive nature,"
3678,MISSION.,"the beauty-loving part of man, alone can do. There is an intellectual"
3679,MISSION.,delight in botanizing and in picking to pieces and analyzing the
3680,MISSION.,"gathered specimens, but it is not that sweet, soul-inspiring pleasure"
3681,MISSION.,born of the love of the beautiful that the heart alone can feel. He who
3682,MISSION.,botanizes the beautiful can never know in his head the supreme pleasure
3683,MISSION.,that he who loves the simple daisy too well to turn it under the sod
3684,MISSION.,feels in his heart.
3685,MISSION.,
3686,MISSION.,Poetry is indeed immortal and divine. It is the breath of heaven in
3687,MISSION.,"the nostrils of man, the divinity of the human soul, the heart in full"
3688,MISSION.,"flower and bloom. To an honest, earnest, sincere soul, it is the wonder"
3689,MISSION.,"of the age, as it has ever been the wonder of all ages, that “men"
3690,MISSION.,"endowed with highest gifts, the vision and the faculty divine,” being"
3691,MISSION.,"divinely appointed as poet-priest of the Almighty, should pander to the"
3692,MISSION.,prurient taste of a so-called practical public;--that they should sell
3693,MISSION.,the divinity within them for a strip of royal purple; for a salve to an
3694,MISSION.,itching palm;--that they should barter immortality for a glitter-jingle.
3695,MISSION.,
3696,MISSION.,But how shall this consummate artist not fall into the corruptions
3697,MISSION.,"that beset him and his art divine? Here are the driveling jinglers,"
3698,MISSION.,"verse-makers, poetasters all about him, with their rattling,"
3699,MISSION.,"rollicking, banging tin-panery, loudly applauded by a rough-and-ready"
3700,MISSION.,"guffawing public; a “practical” public that loudly clamors for _sense_,"
3701,MISSION.,"_fact_,--and then drops another penny into the chapeaux of these"
3702,MISSION.,venders of cheap jewelry for more of their applauded cheap sentiment
3703,MISSION.,"and glittering platitudes, and jingling chains and necklaces, and"
3704,MISSION.,"rings, and things, whose brightness wears off in their mental pockets"
3705,MISSION.,before the wife or sweetheart is gladdened by a glimpse of its
3706,MISSION.,“practical” glitter!
3707,MISSION.,
3708,MISSION.,"The great, true poet, he who alone is interpreter of the immortal in"
3709,MISSION.,"the mortal, the invisible in the visible by means of words, never asks"
3710,MISSION.,"how to avoid these corruptions. He does it. He despises, hates, abhors"
3711,MISSION.,"them. He does it, too, by obeying that Divinity within him. Obedient"
3712,MISSION.,"to that call, he walks majestically through this motley crowd;--aye,"
3713,MISSION.,"through this sometimes maudlin, jeering crowd that throw stones at him"
3714,MISSION.,and mentally would crucify him!--and sets some stream of Beauty and
3715,MISSION.,"Glory flowing through the hearts of men, forever to wash away these"
3716,MISSION.,"corruptions and stagnations of the human soul. Aye, truly! he asks not"
3717,MISSION.,"how, but teaches us how. Was it not so with those old Divine Writers,"
3718,MISSION.,"our highest type of poets, whose inspirations make the one Immortal"
3719,MISSION.,Book? So shall it ever be. ’Tis the Divine Law.
3720,MISSION.,
3721,MISSION.,"Such a poet, interpreting nature and mirroring Divinity, and thus"
3722,MISSION.,"idealizing life that the seeing, aspiring soul may attain nearer its"
3723,MISSION.,"illimitable possibilities, we call an original poet, a genius. He is"
3724,MISSION.,"never a “popular” poet, as that term is used, but he is quite generally"
3725,MISSION.,unpopular. Popular in the sense of time-enduring he is by that same
3726,MISSION.,Divine Law that brings him into existence. His soul will inevitably
3727,MISSION.,have some greatness in common with other great souls. These will rescue
3728,MISSION.,"him and commend him to an increasing posterity; and so on and on,"
3729,MISSION.,"touching more and more souls, and thus seeming to grow ever better and"
3730,MISSION.,"better, though in reality he remains ever unchanged, while the souls he"
3731,MISSION.,"touches are the ones that ever strive to his greater height, and draw"
3732,MISSION.,up numbers with them.
3733,MISSION.,
3734,MISSION.,"Thus does he whom an unappreciating, small-souled mob would have"
3735,MISSION.,"crucified, become immortal through the reciprocal divinity that is"
3736,MISSION.,"in himself and in the heart of humanity. Thus does, thus must, this"
3737,MISSION.,poet-genius create--call into activity--the taste that must make him
3738,MISSION.,"time-enduring. This is the penalty of genius and greatness--to suffer,"
3739,MISSION.,and then triumphantly to endure forever in the hearts of men. Who would
3740,MISSION.,"he were not a genius? Who would he were? In proof of all this, witness"
3741,MISSION.,"Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, not to speak of all the greatest Great."
3742,MISSION.,
3743,MISSION.,"I love that unswerving poetic genius who, in the face of taunts and"
3744,MISSION.,"revilings and sneers, still is obedient to that sublime divinity within"
3745,MISSION.,"him; who, conscious of his own soul’s illimitable vastness, must"
3746,MISSION.,"inevitably write for that soul’s satisfaction, and thus write, not for"
3747,MISSION.,"the present generation, but for posterity; and who, when he “wraps"
3748,MISSION.,"the drapery of his couch about him,” having obeyed the divine voice"
3749,MISSION.,"within him even to his latest breath, finally triumphs over all sneers"
3750,MISSION.,"and taunts and jeers, triumphs even over death, and, though dead,"
3751,MISSION.,triumphantly lives in immortal words that still speak to us more and
3752,MISSION.,more divinely through the trumpet-soul of the more and more divine ages.
3753,MISSION.,
3754,MISSION.,"Such a poet, I say, must create the taste that will make him"
3755,MISSION.,"time-enduring. In other words, this true poet, this genius (else he"
3756,MISSION.,"were no genius at all), must see some relation of soul to soul not"
3757,MISSION.,"ordinarily seen, and never at all seen in exactly the same way, and"
3758,MISSION.,so express that relation in words that humanity can but recognize it
3759,MISSION.,"from the very fact of its commonness, its universality. Such a poet"
3760,MISSION.,"never follows public opinion, in the narrow sense of the opinion of a"
3761,MISSION.,transitory present; but through great trials and suffering and much
3762,MISSION.,"enduring generally, he leads it, or creates it rather, and develops it"
3763,MISSION.,"into that broader, truer public opinion,--humanity’s opinion; the only"
3764,MISSION.,"opinion, I should say, that is equal to that of a great soul."
3765,MISSION.,
3766,MISSION.,"The great never follow, but ever lead. They never pander to a perverted"
3767,MISSION.,"public taste, but follow their own convictions; and thus following the"
3768,MISSION.,"guiding power within them, they lead others in the same path. Thus"
3769,MISSION.,"drawn onwards and upwards by that link which binds man unto God, and"
3770,MISSION.,"thus leading humanity aright, they instinctively obey the teachings of"
3771,MISSION.,"Him, the Master, who “came not to be ministered unto, but to minister”;"
3772,MISSION.,for they follow in His footsteps by upward leading and by thus greatly
3773,MISSION.,and divinely serving mankind.
3774,MISSION.,
3775,MISSION.,"In a general way, I may say of poets that there are two classes:--the"
3776,MISSION.,"introspective, or those whose souls, ever standing in the presence of"
3777,MISSION.,"the Divinity within them, hear the calls of other souls and the mighty"
3778,MISSION.,"voice of God; and hearing, obey;--the extrospective, or those whose"
3779,MISSION.,"souls, not less divine, but less conscious, perhaps, of that Divinity,"
3780,MISSION.,"unconsciously perceive the manifold relations in external nature, and"
3781,MISSION.,through the universal spirit of nature none the less distinctly hear
3782,MISSION.,that same Almighty Voice. We shall hardly find a poet in whom one
3783,MISSION.,of these characteristics exists to the exclusion of the other; but
3784,MISSION.,we shall find that in many cases one characteristic or the other is
3785,MISSION.,"dominant. For example, Browning is one of our best representatives"
3786,MISSION.,"of the introspective, and Wordsworth of the extrospective; while"
3787,MISSION.,Shakespeare is the highest type of the perfect union of the two. Both
3788,MISSION.,"classes obey the same voice, and though ministering through different"
3789,MISSION.,"sources, have the same mission to perform, the uplifting and purifying"
3790,MISSION.,of the human soul.
3791,MISSION.,
3792,MISSION.,"Indeed, whatever does not have this mission is not true poetry. It is"
3793,MISSION.,often said that that literature is best which has stood the test of
3794,MISSION.,"time. Not so, if by that is meant simply that the literature shall"
3795,MISSION.,have lived long; for both good and bad live. The true test is that it
3796,MISSION.,"betters man’s estate, and ennobles his heart. If a poem inspires the"
3797,MISSION.,"heart with nobler feelings and greater love, then it is a good poem."
3798,MISSION.,"This is the crucial, the only true test."
3799,MISSION.,
3800,MISSION.,There is no act of the human mind that is not controlled by the
3801,MISSION.,"feelings. When this is comprehended and when, at the same time, it"
3802,MISSION.,"is perceived to what an extent poetry ministers to the feelings, the"
3803,MISSION.,utility of poetry will be better appreciated. Poetry thus ministering
3804,MISSION.,"to the controlling forces of life, is a guide and corrective of life;"
3805,MISSION.,a guide in that it is “a representation of life” (as Alfred Austin has
3806,MISSION.,"it), the experiences of the hearts of men; a corrective in that it is"
3807,MISSION.,"“a criticism of life” (as Matthew Arnold says), an idealization that,"
3808,MISSION.,"by uplifting, corrects the heart that else would droop. Austin thinks"
3809,MISSION.,his idea opposes Arnold’s. It does not. Each simply looks at one side;
3810,MISSION.,each takes a different angle. Both are correct so far as they go. For
3811,MISSION.,"poetry is the heart’s history. It is also the ever present attempt, in"
3812,MISSION.,"the light of that guiding lamp, to the making of a better history."
3813,MISSION.,
3814,MISSION.,"This, indeed, makes it philosophy. For what else does philosophy do?"
3815,MISSION.,The poet is ever a philosopher. Is not poetry philosophy teaching by
3816,MISSION.,"experience? It does not teach by precept, it is not didactic; that"
3817,MISSION.,is the province of prose; but it mirrors the human heart and reveals
3818,MISSION.,its experiences. Nine hundred ninety-nine people shape their lives
3819,MISSION.,by experience where one shapes his by rule and thumb. One rose of
3820,MISSION.,experience with its warning thorns has more of humanity and guidance
3821,MISSION.,in it than all the tangle-woods of teaching. The hand must follow the
3822,MISSION.,heart. If the heart be right the hand can never go wrong.
3823,MISSION.,
3824,MISSION.,He who would be an immortal poet must have a great and sympathizing
3825,MISSION.,"heart; a heart that laughs and weeps, and most of all, a heart that"
3826,MISSION.,"loves. Were I asked the one essential of the poet, that essential"
3827,MISSION.,"which includes all minor requisites, I should answer, Love. “A Poet"
3828,MISSION.,"without Love,” says Carlyle, “were a physical and a metaphysical"
3829,MISSION.,impossibility.” It is the dominating element of all great poets. What
3830,MISSION.,"poet is greater, or what one has loved more deeply than Burns?"
3831,MISSION.,
3832,MISSION.,Love often reveals itself in sorrow and in humor. Though the poet need
3833,MISSION.,"not be a humorist, must not be at all times, as the term is used, it"
3834,MISSION.,is nevertheless essential that he have a lively appreciation of the
3835,MISSION.,"ludicrous, lest he fall into grave errors of thought and expression."
3836,MISSION.,But the humor must not be the all-pervading element of his poetry; it
3837,MISSION.,"should be simply a check, a guide, or sometimes a spur. A keen sense"
3838,MISSION.,of humor should be to him the lash that whips thought out of its
3839,MISSION.,"self-constituted morbid glooms, in which it appears ridiculous, into"
3840,MISSION.,a lively harmony with things as they really are to the hearts of men.
3841,MISSION.,"It were, indeed, a nice question to determine how far the grave or"
3842,MISSION.,the humorous should enter poetic composition to the exclusion of the
3843,MISSION.,other. Certainly the most felicitous poetry is not all rain nor all
3844,MISSION.,"shine, but the iris of Ulloa struck out of the depths of tears by the"
3845,MISSION.,"happy, hopeful shine of laughter."
3846,MISSION.,
3847,MISSION.,"But if the poet laugh, he must also love; for he laughs because he"
3848,MISSION.,loves. This is the divine law. The man who hates never laughs; he may
3849,MISSION.,"mock. Well may we ponder that. Indeed, tears and laughter, sometimes"
3850,MISSION.,"blended, are but forms of love. If laughter is music, certainly love,"
3851,MISSION.,"that divine gift in the human heart, love of the good, the beautiful,"
3852,MISSION.,"and the true, love of home, of country, of mankind, of God, or of"
3853,MISSION.,"a beautiful image of God, the one who is the heart’s ideal, divine"
3854,MISSION.,"immortal love, is perfect harmony. If the poet’s theme is of the good,"
3855,MISSION.,"the beautiful, and the true, so must his love be. If these dwell not in"
3856,MISSION.,"his heart, he shall search the world and the ages through and not find"
3857,MISSION.,"them; and if love dwell not there with them, his themes shall never"
3858,MISSION.,touch our hearts.
3859,MISSION.,
3860,MISSION.,"But the poet, to be appreciated, is not the only one that must possess"
3861,MISSION.,these qualities. It is the beauty and the love in the soul of him who
3862,MISSION.,"is touched by the statue, the painting, the melody, the poem, that"
3863,MISSION.,makes it beautiful to him. It is thus that we help the poet make the
3864,MISSION.,poem. Love makes poets of us all.
3865,MISSION.,
3866,MISSION.,"With our hearts thus tuned to the touch of the Maker’s hand, we may"
3867,MISSION.,often hold sweet communion with our poet-friends whose love still
3868,MISSION.,reaches out to us through the mists of ages and beckons us to the
3869,MISSION.,"Valhalla of the happy. We may stand alone in the stern, inquisitorial"
3870,MISSION.,"presence of self under the eye of Almighty God, and think thoughts our"
3871,MISSION.,tongues can never tell.

3879,MISSION.,
3880,MISSION.,"“... the morn, in russet mantle clad,"
3881,MISSION.,Walks o’er the dew of yond high eastern hill”;
3882,MISSION.,
3883,MISSION.,and then with them both we may pass down the slope to the sea-shore
3884,MISSION.,"where we clasp hands with Laureate Tennyson and, as we listen to the"
3885,MISSION.,"_break, break, break_ upon the sands, say in our hearts with him,"
3886,MISSION.,
3887,MISSION.,“And I would that my tongue could utter
3888,MISSION.,The thoughts that arise in me.”
3889,MISSION.,
3890,MISSION.,With Milton we may plunge to the lowest depths and rise to the greatest

3893,MISSION.,"the battling brave below,"
3894,MISSION.,
3895,MISSION.,"“If the world be worth thy winning,"
3896,MISSION.,"Think, oh think it worth enjoying”;"

3903,MISSION.,"With Whittier, longing to do and doing the greatest good of which we"

3914,MISSION.,"In our sadder moods we may, with Cowper, look across the dark,"

3917,MISSION.,"flowers and garland them in love; and, whether in field or shop or"
3918,MISSION.,"kirk, learn somewhat"
3919,MISSION.,

5732,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5733,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I am not superstitious, not in the least. But that certain things which"
5734,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,we cannot explain by any natural method may happen in the lives of us
5735,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"all, there is no longer a shadow of a doubt in my own mind."
5736,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5737,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I had gone to bed as usual and had been sleeping soundly one night,"
5738,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,with only the faint glimmer of a sweet vision now and then flitting
5739,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"through my mind, when suddenly I was startled from my sleep into a"
5740,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"lively consciousness of a strange presence, and weird, mournful sounds,"
5741,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"as of a dirge, in my room. Moreover, there was a peculiar sensation in"
5742,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"my head, a sensation that I have never before or since felt, a kind of"
5743,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"pain, yet not a pain; for in some indefinable way it was mysteriously"
5744,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"mingled with a peculiar, almost transporting rapture that seemed to"
5745,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"permeate my whole being. Indeed, the pain, starting immediately between"
5746,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"my brows and running back to my crown, seemed born of this pleasurable"
5747,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"sensation, which had no local residence but was in every nerve and"
5748,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"fibre, both together producing that indescribable exhilarating feeling"
5749,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"that I imagine the truly happy in the next world possess. But, you say,"
5750,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"surely the angels have no pain. I hope not; but this I have learned,"
5751,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,that every pleasure of earth has its pain. And as I cannot say that
5752,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"this sensation was altogether that of a mortal, I cannot say from"
5753,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,experience that there is a pleasure without a pain.
5754,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5755,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"For a moment after awaking, I could not tell where I was or what was"
5756,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"going on. But my senses being quickly roused to their fullest keenness,"
5757,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I soon saw I was in my own room. But the matter of the presence and
5758,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,the weird sound was not so easily solved.
5759,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5760,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I lay quietly for a time, trying to persuade myself that I had been"
5761,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,dreaming and that my waking fancy was merely the hallucination of the
5762,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,dream that had not yet passed away. Have you never done the like?
5763,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"However, I soon realized that the presence and the sound, whoever or"
5764,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"whatever they were, were not mere fancy. Still I tried to shake off the"
5765,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"feeling that some one had entered my room; for, as is my custom, I had"
5766,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"securely barred the front door, also my bed-room door, before retiring."
5767,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Besides, no one could possibly have climbed in at my windows of the"
5768,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,second story without my knowing it; for when I am so nervous as I was
5769,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"this night, the slightest sound will waken me. I turned over and looked"
5770,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"out of the window. The moon was still shining, and the trees swayed"
5771,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,with a soft murmur in answer to the light breeze that wantoned among
5772,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"the virgin May leaves just lately from the bud. There were the houses,"
5773,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"the barns, the road, everything, in fact, just as it really was, and I"
5774,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,knew I could not possibly be asleep.
5775,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5776,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Still, that consciousness of a presence in my room, stronger and"
5777,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"stronger grown until it had reached conviction, I could not rid myself"
5778,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,of; nor could I shut my ears to the mournful sounds that came from
5779,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"somewhere--everywhere, it seemed."
5780,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5781,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Suddenly--most wonderful to tell!--I saw the very faintest streak of
5782,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,light creep up the farther wall of my room.
5783,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5784,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"All that I have related did not, perhaps, occupy more than a full"
5785,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"minute, though I must confess it seemed much longer."
5786,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5787,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"The thread of light, different from all lights I have ever before seen,"
5788,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"moved toward the ceiling rapidly, and held me in breathless attention."
5789,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,What could it be!--A ray of the moon through a slit in the curtain that
5790,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,was gently moved by the breeze blowing through the window? Wait! It
5791,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,reached the ceiling. Then with such a delicate light that it was almost
5792,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"imperceptible, it crept along the ceiling diagonally toward me. When it"
5793,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"got immediately above my head, it stopped. What in the world could it"
5794,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,be!
5795,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5796,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I lay almost breathless, wondering. Wouldn’t you, my friend, if you"
5797,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,should see such a thing in your room? You may not know what you would
5798,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"do in such case. Possibly you say you would investigate at once. So,"
5799,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"too, had I said many a time,--I would investigate whatever was strange,"
5800,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"doubtful, or inexplicable. But if your hands would not move, if your"
5801,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"feet lay motionless, and if your whole being were thrilled with a"
5802,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"thralling rapture and pain all at once, you would probably do just as I"
5803,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"did,--lie there fascinated."
5804,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5805,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Suddenly, like a flash, something struck me on the forehead, and"
5806,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"instantly I sat bolt upright in bed. As I rose, whatever it was"
5807,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"that struck me bounded off on the bed, then down on the floor, that"
5808,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"mysterious filmy thread of light following it, and at the same time"
5809,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,clinging to my forehead. I put my hand up to brush it away. But when
5810,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I touched it (if I really did touch it, which I doubt, for my hand"
5811,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"seemed suddenly arrested), my whole body trembled as if shaken by some"
5812,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"supernatural power. It was something more than a light,--it was a film,"
5813,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"a thread; and at my touch upon it, that sensation of mingled pain and"
5814,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,rapture was almost beyond my power to survive. I let my hand drop
5815,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"from it, and unable to resist doing what I did, I rose from my bed and"
5816,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,started to follow up that thread of light and film; for somehow it
5817,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"seemed attached to my brain, and I involuntarily obeyed the will of"
5818,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,whoever or whatever it was that controlled it. Though fully conscious
5819,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"of all I was doing, I could not resist. Great beads of sweat stood on"
5820,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"my body, caused partly, I suppose, by extreme nervous excitement and"
5821,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,partly by this influence upon me.
5822,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5823,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I would have hastened from the room, screamed for help, or cried"
5824,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,“murder!” but it was impossible. Even the rapidity of my steps was
5825,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"under control, and I marched slowly, deliberately, and solemnly, as to"
5826,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,martial music of the dead.
5827,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5828,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I passed from my sleeping-room to my study, obedient to the slightest"
5829,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,inclination of the supernatural power that controlled the thread by
5830,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,which I was led.
5831,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5832,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"When I reached my study-chair at my desk, I obediently sat down. Then"
5833,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,for the first time I beheld the object that was exerting this power
5834,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,over me. I have seen many an object before and since very similar to
5835,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"it, but never at any time another just like it."
5836,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5837,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"As I sat in my chair, my eyes riveted on the thread of light, suddenly"
5838,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,that object appeared at the other end of the thread on a pile of
5839,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"blank writing paper that lay on my desk, and eyed me intently. I was"
5840,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"horrified, and if possible, less capable of resisting than before. What"
5841,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I beheld, and what was exerting this supernatural influence over me was"
5842,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"nothing more nor less than a horrible, ugly spider!--a supernatural"
5843,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"spider, most certainly; different, I tell you, from any I have ever"
5844,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,before or since seen.
5845,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5846,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"As I sat watching the spider, it began moving up and down, back and"
5847,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"forth, and round and round on the paper in the most irregular motions"
5848,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"imaginable. Being rather large and clumsy-looking, his movements, so"
5849,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"very irregular though really not ungraceful, made the spider at first"
5850,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,look awkward.
5851,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5852,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Wonder upon wonder! As the spider began moving, another one, somewhat"
5853,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"smaller than the first, and more dimly seen, with even a finer thread"
5854,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"of light (attached, too, to the first spider’s thread), made its"
5855,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,appearance on another pile of paper. Could it be that a whole army of
5856,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"spiders had convened to work my destruction, and that these two were"
5857,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"only the picket-guards? Yet it did seem that this one was not present,"
5858,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"but only the vision of a spider, existing somewhere in reality, but"
5859,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"present only to my mind. This, too, I am persuaded to believe, was"
5860,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"really the case. But the other one, the larger one, I swear was there"
5861,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,moving on my paper; and I still have the paper in my possession as
5862,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"proof. As this one began to move, the visionary one also began to move;"
5863,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"as if each, unconscious of the acts of the other, was nevertheless"
5864,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"controlled by the action of the other, and the influence upon each"
5865,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"other was mutual. As they both moved, I noticed they left their"
5866,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"shining, filmy thread upon the paper. But I was so intent upon every"
5867,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"motion that I paid no attention to the web left behind, until each"
5868,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"spider, having almost reached the right-hand side of the paper, cut his"
5869,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"thread, went to the left, and began again to go through similar motions."
5870,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5871,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"What could be the meaning of this mystic spider-dance? Such, indeed,"
5872,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,it now seemed to be; for my first impression of irregularity and
5873,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"clumsiness had now worn away, and their motions now seemed to be in"
5874,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"perfect unison, and measured with the grace and harmony of rhythm. The"
5875,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,room was but dimly lighted by the rays of moon that slipped in under
5876,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"the curtains, yet I could see the spiders and their work plainly. I"
5877,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"glanced at the glowing web the first spider had left, and--wonderful to"
5878,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"relate!--as true as the sun shines above us, there at the top of the"
5879,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"page in writing that, had it been in ink, I would have sworn was my"
5880,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"own, the glowing web had been woven in and out so as to read, _Happy"
5881,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Days of Yore!_
5882,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5883,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Could it be possible?--was I not dreaming? I looked and read and read
5884,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"and looked again and again. But there it was, plain as day, in a style"
5885,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"of writing, too, I say, that I would have sworn was my own had it been"
5886,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,in ink instead of woven in a glowing web. But why those words? Could
5887,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"there be something in my life, past or present, that those words were"
5888,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"to taunt me about? My whole life’s history trailed before my eyes, a"
5889,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"galaxy of pleasant memories. No, nothing there that these words could"
5890,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,make regretful. Could it then portend something of a dark future? God
5891,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,alone knows!
5892,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5893,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Thus meditating, my eye caught the less distinct glow of the web of the"
5894,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"other spider. Heavens! what next! There, as distinct as if written by"
5895,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"the hand of my old chum, were the words, _Memories of the Past_. Here"
5896,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,was a mystery growing deeper and deeper each moment. I would willingly
5897,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"have taken my oath, and will to this day, that the handwriting was that"
5898,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,of my boyhood chum and present dear old friend.
5899,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5900,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"_Happy Days of Yore_,--_Memories of the Past_. How was I to solve"
5901,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,the mystery of the weaving of these words and fathom their intended
5902,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,meaning? Both suggested to my mind a similar train of thought. But why
5903,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,this mysterious writing?
5904,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5905,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"As I sat thus meditating, I again became conscious of that weird"
5906,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"sound of which I have previously spoken, but which (my mind being so"
5907,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,preoccupied with what was before it) I had not again noticed until I
5908,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,fell into this meditation.
5909,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5910,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"It sounded like the sweet, sad blending of mournful voices singing,"
5911,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"or chanting, rather, to the deep tones of a distant organ. I recalled"
5912,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"myself and looked at the large spider, when I discovered that--mystery"
5913,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,of mysteries!--the echo-like organ voice and solemn chanting music
5914,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"came from the spider alone as he moved across the paper, weaving his"
5915,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"golden web into rhythmic words! There, as the music went on, I read in"
5916,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,illuminated characters of the weaving spider’s web.--
5917,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5918,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Oh those happy days of yore
5919,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Will come back to me no more!
5920,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Ah no more, no more for aye!--"
5921,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"They have fled with time away,"
5922,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And my heart is sad and lone
5923,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"As I dream forevermore,"
5924,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"With a heaving sigh and groan,"
5925,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Of those happy days of yore.
5926,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5927,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Most wonderful!--wonderful not in the words so much, for they were"
5928,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"simple, plain, and as they moved to the music, graceful withal, seeming"
5929,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,to be words that might come from a sincere and true but untutored
5930,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"poetic heart; wonderful, therefore, rather, that they should be woven"
5931,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"by a spider, and that, too, with a web of light."
5932,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5933,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"As in eager wonder I leaned my ear closer, the vision of the second"
5934,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"and more delicate spider, likewise weaving, passed before my eyes, and"
5935,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I caught the distant strains of a deeper, sadder, sweeter melody, with"
5936,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"these words woven in the finer, more delicate thread of light.--"
5937,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5938,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Oh how sweet those days of boyhood,"
5939,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Oh how dear those happy hours
5940,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,When I rambled through the forests
5941,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,’Mong the birds and trees and flowers!
5942,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Life lay smiling all before me,"
5943,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"No regrets, no cares behind;"
5944,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"All the earth seemed bright with beauty,"
5945,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Life was freedom unconfined.
5946,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I rejoiced whene’er the sunlight
5947,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Scattered wide its golden beams,"
5948,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Thinking not that I should ever
5949,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Miss its light or prize its gleams.
5950,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5951,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Still more wonderful and remarkable than anything before was the
5952,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,similarity of music as well as of thought: more wonderful and more
5953,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,remarkable because neither spider seemed conscious of the other’s
5954,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"action or presence. Indeed, as I have already said, only one"
5955,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"really was present; the other existing in another place, and only"
5956,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"_psychologically_ present to me. This latter fact, shown in all that"
5957,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"follows, I tell you, is the most remarkable psychological problem I"
5958,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,have ever met--except one!--nor have I ever yet found sage or savant
5959,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"able to solve it. Many have tried it, wondered at it more and more as"
5960,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"they got more and more into its depths and subtle intricacies, and"
5961,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"finally in their weakness have given it up. Herbert Spencer, McCosh,"
5962,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,and other lesser philosophers cannot satisfy themselves upon it.
5963,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5964,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"My interest was now, if possible, even greater than before. Again I"
5965,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,turned my attention to the present spider as in melody it wove.--
5966,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5967,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Oh those days of sweetest thought!
5968,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Oh those days with rapture fraught!
5969,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Had I known when but a child
5970,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"What great blessings round me smiled,"
5971,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"With a wild, exulting leap"
5972,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I’d have struck on wisdom’s door;
5973,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Piled up knowledge heap on heap
5974,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those happy days of yore.
5975,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5976,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Both were weaving rapidly, as if their very lives were an ephemeral"
5977,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"inspiration, and they were thus weaving it away in illuminated letters,"
5978,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"that at least that inspiration might live, though the very weaving"
5979,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"should cost both their lives. So I hastened again to look, and to"
5980,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,listen to the other richer and deeper melody.--
5981,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5982,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Ah, those days are gone forever;"
5983,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Time has wafted them away;
5984,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Happiness now seems a phantom
5985,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Of a joyous yesterday.
5986,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"If I could but live them over,"
5987,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"All those careless, happy hours,"
5988,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Start again in life’s fair morning
5989,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"O’er life’s path of thorns and flowers,"
5990,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Not a moment would be wasted
5991,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Chasing bubbles in the air--
5992,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I would seek the pearls of knowledge,"
5993,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And the gems of wisdom wear.
5994,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
5995,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Could it be that those two spiders were endowed with human faculties,"
5996,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"and that those faculties were now working in unison, inspired by the"
5997,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"same thought, the same feeling? I had little time to meditate this, for"
5998,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,both wrote (I can’t help saying they _wrote_) as rapidly as slow music
5999,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"goes, or about as rapidly as I am writing this; and the first spider"
6000,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,had already begun the third stanza.--
6001,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6002,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Could I live again those days
6003,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,That I spent in idle plays
6004,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"And could know of learning’s worth,"
6005,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I’d not waste my time in mirth;--
6006,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I would climb the hill of fame
6007,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And on wisdom’s wings would soar
6008,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Till I caught the beacon flame
6009,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those happy days of yore.
6010,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6011,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I then involuntarily turned to the other; but finding that it had
6012,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"completed a page, as indeed both had done, I removed the finished sheet"
6013,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,of the visible one and at the same instant and by the same act removed
6014,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,that of the psychologically visible one; though how this latter was
6015,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,accomplished even psychologists are at their wits’ end to explain. Even
6016,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,to the close I continued thus to remove the finished sheets as soon as
6017,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,they were completed. And now from the second I heard.--
6018,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6019,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Had I known of wisdom’s power
6020,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"In those days with pleasure fraught,"
6021,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,From the mines of truth and beauty
6022,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Golden trophies I’d have brought.
6023,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,All the lore of bygone ages
6024,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,From my books I would have learned;
6025,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,O’er the bards I would have pondered
6026,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Tho’ my lamp till morning burned;
6027,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,All the broad empire of Nature
6028,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,With its wealth of laws divine
6029,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Should have shown to me the beauty
6030,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Of Omnipotent design.
6031,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6032,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"While I listened to this, the first spider, apparently conscious of"
6033,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"my abstraction, had waited; but on again bending my eyes in that"
6034,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"direction, again the sad melody floated upwards and away to the"
6035,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,heart-felt words.--
6036,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6037,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Oh, my heart grows weak and faint,"
6038,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And it sighs in sad complaint
6039,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,As it dreams its dreams of woe
6040,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Of the silent long ago.
6041,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"And a pain is at my heart,"
6042,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Not alone for wisdom’s lore,"
6043,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,For ’twas pierced by sorrow’s dart
6044,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those happy days of yore.
6045,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6046,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,What strange tale could this be I was listening to? I turned to the
6047,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"second weaver of words to mournful melody, and caught the same spirit"
6048,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,in these similar words.--
6049,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6050,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I’d have read that revelation
6051,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Traced by our Creator’s hand
6052,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Over all our glorious planet,"
6053,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In the sky and sea and land.
6054,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,High and bright the lamp of knowledge
6055,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Shone for all who’d seek its light;
6056,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Ah, how oft I scorned to seek it"
6057,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In the glare of pleasures bright!
6058,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Oft upon the dreary mountain
6059,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Have my weary footsteps strayed:--
6060,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,But ’tis not for wisdom only
6061,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,That my vain regrets are made.
6062,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6063,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,So! what a train of unutterable sadness the last words of each called
6064,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"up, suggesting some strange sorrow that must force itself into"
6065,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"expression of sorrowing strains of music, tuned to even sadder words."
6066,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Ah yes! to the first, listen!--"
6067,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6068,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,_She_ was like a radiant rose
6069,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,That with sweetness overflows.
6070,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Her bright eyes were darkest blue
6071,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And her hair a golden hue.
6072,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"She was lovely as the day,"
6073,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And within her breast she bore
6074,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Heart as light and bright and gay
6075,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,As those happy days of yore.
6076,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6077,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Breathlessly I turned to the cadence of the other.--
6078,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6079,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"In those days of idle dreaming,"
6080,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Ere life’s toils I’d entered in,"
6081,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Fancy framed for me an image
6082,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Of the one I’d woo and win.
6083,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,It was in an idle romance
6084,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,My ideal played a part;
6085,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"But that image, framed in fancy,"
6086,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Soon was graven on my heart,"
6087,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"And I said, “That maiden only"
6088,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Of my ideal’s charms complete
6089,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Shall have power to lead me captive
6090,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And to bring me to her feet.”
6091,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6092,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Ah, ’tis the old, old story that ever sings itself in the human heart,"
6093,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,the story of love. But can it be these spiders are human that they
6094,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,should thus weave their gold-enlighted words to silver chords of
6095,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,harmony?
6096,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6097,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Once more!--To the first rhythmic weaver, a pleasing recollection.--"
6098,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6099,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"We were playmates, she and I,"
6100,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In that happy time gone by:
6101,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Oft we’d walk the meadows over
6102,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Hunting for the four-leaved clover
6103,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,As we’d seen the lovers do;
6104,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,We the woods would oft explore
6105,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Where the fragrant flowers grew
6106,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those happy days of yore.
6107,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6108,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"And then to the second, the same image, lifting upward and away, above"
6109,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"the clover-blooms and forest-flowers of sweet memory, comes like the"
6110,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,peace of a benediction; and the words weave to quicker though to still
6111,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,sad notes.--
6112,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6113,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Time passed on and boyish fancies
6114,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Were by youth’s bright hopes replaced;
6115,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Gay companions were around me,--"
6116,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Every pleasure we embraced.
6117,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"And among those friends and schoolmates,"
6118,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,There was one surpassing fair:
6119,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Light her heart and light her footstep,"
6120,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Blue her eyes and gold her hair.
6121,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Then her pure and gentle spirit
6122,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Shone abroad like smiles from heaven.--
6123,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Ah, such divine gifts of beauty"
6124,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Seldom are to mortals given.
6125,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6126,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"The first one had now finished two pages; the second, three. How"
6127,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,much more they would weave I neither knew nor thought. I was too
6128,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,much fascinated by the weirdness and reality of it all to think of
6129,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,anything but the two stories that were being thus wonderfully--thus
6130,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,psychologically though not supernaturally--revealed to me in beauty by
6131,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"ugly spiders that wrought together; each, I knew, unconscious of the"
6132,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"other. This fact of each being unconscious of the words, thoughts, and"
6133,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"music of the other, and the fact that the web of one was woven into"
6134,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"characters to represent my handwriting, while that of the other was the"
6135,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"illuminated work of my old chum, gave the two songs an interest that no"
6136,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"one else can even approach. No, not even if the same situation should"
6137,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"present itself to him, and the spiders should be actually before him,"
6138,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"as their work, robbed of all these fascinating features, now is."
6139,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6140,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Both now wove more and more rapidly, and it was only when the first"
6141,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,had woven the following whole page of manuscript that I turned to the
6142,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,other.--
6143,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6144,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Oft when twilight slowly crept
6145,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Over hill and vale that slept,"
6146,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,We would wander side by side
6147,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In the golden eventide
6148,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,By the school-house on the hill
6149,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Where so oft we’d been before,"
6150,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Or beside the water-mill
6151,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those happy days of yore.
6152,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6153,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Oh those days,--sweet, happy days!"
6154,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Ever round my mind there plays
6155,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Fitful Fancy’s dear delight,"
6156,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Bringing back the time so bright
6157,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,When we wandered hand in hand
6158,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"To the little country store,"
6159,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And the mystic future planned
6160,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those happy days of yore.
6161,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6162,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,New years came as old ones went;
6163,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Childhood’s years at last were spent;
6164,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,We from friends to lovers grew
6165,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And nor pain nor sorrow knew.
6166,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Oh how fondly did I dream
6167,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Folding close my fond Lenore
6168,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,As we sailed adown life’s stream
6169,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those happy days of yore!
6170,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6171,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Here the sad-voiced dreamer paused a moment, then glided to the"
6172,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"top of the page and waited for me to remove the leaf, while I read"
6173,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,and half aloud chanted from the illuminated page of the other this
6174,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,master-melody:--
6175,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6176,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"When she came, ’twas like the sunbeam"
6177,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Shedding gladness o’er the lea;
6178,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"When she’d gone, ’twas like the ceasing"
6179,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Of enchanting melody.
6180,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Oft when daily tasks were over,"
6181,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,She and I together strolled
6182,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,From the hamlet to the seaside
6183,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Where the restless billows rolled.
6184,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Hours and hours we’d wander, gathering"
6185,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Treasures from the shifting sand
6186,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,As each ebbing tide receding
6187,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Left its wonders on the strand.
6188,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6189,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Long we’d watch the stately vessels
6190,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Riding proudly o’er the foam,"
6191,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Some for distant countries steering,"
6192,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Some returning--bound for home.
6193,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Then we’d seek the peaceful harbor
6194,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Where our little sail-boat lay,"
6195,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And while skimming o’er the waters
6196,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Laugh and sing the hours away.
6197,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Then at twilight, when all nature"
6198,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Save the sea was hushed and still,"
6199,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,We would turn our footsteps homeward
6200,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,To the hamlet on the hill.
6201,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6202,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"So pleasing was this recollection that I could not yet turn away, but"
6203,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"listened rather than read, as the musician continued on the next page;"
6204,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"for he had finished this, and the harmony continued unbroken."
6205,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6206,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And that image framed in boyhood
6207,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Of the one I’d woo and win,"
6208,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Ah, my ideal!--I had found her"
6209,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In my darling Evylyn.
6210,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"But the dim, uncertain future!--"
6211,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Oh that we could raise the veil
6212,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And by gazing down the valley
6213,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Know what fortune would prevail;
6214,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Whether joy or blinding sorrow,"
6215,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Gladness or unending woe,"
6216,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Should forever be our portion
6217,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,While we linger here below.
6218,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6219,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Two short summers I had known her,"
6220,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Years that seemed like one bright day;
6221,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"But at last the spell was broken,"
6222,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And my gladness fled away:
6223,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Duty called me from that hamlet
6224,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Where youth’s happy days were spent
6225,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Out into the great, free, wide world,"
6226,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And with brightest hopes I went.
6227,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Ah, that parting by the seaside"
6228,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,One bright evening in the spring
6229,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,By the dear old friendly ocean--
6230,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,There I gave the engagement ring.
6231,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6232,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Just here a sharp pain in my right forefinger interrupted the music,"
6233,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,and reminded me that I had not removed the completed page of the first
6234,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"harmony-breathing minstrel. I immediately did so, and at once the"
6235,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,billows of subdued music swept through the room to the perfect time of
6236,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,the weaver’s words in portentous minstrelsy.--
6237,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6238,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"In the bright and merry spring,"
6239,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Then I gave the engagement ring;
6240,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And in sweet and holy bliss
6241,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Sealed our vow with Love’s own kiss.
6242,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Heart and hope and thought were one
6243,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,As we walked as heretofore
6244,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Where the brooklet used to run
6245,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those happy days of yore.
6246,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6247,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,But the future none can tell
6248,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"And, or weal or woe, ’tis well;"
6249,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"For, if it were otherwise,"
6250,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,When the mystic veil should rise
6251,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"And reveal what is to come,"
6252,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Happiness would be no more;--
6253,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Hearts would call to hearts but dumb
6254,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those happy days of yore.
6255,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6256,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Could we gaze on life’s emprise,"
6257,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Frozen tears would dim our eyes;
6258,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Rippling laughs on lips would freeze
6259,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,As the future’s death-cold breeze
6260,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Chilled the life of loving hearts;
6261,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Happy days would come no more,"
6262,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And we’d sigh with fitful starts
6263,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,For those happy days of yore.
6264,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6265,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Here I noticed the striking difference (the only difference throughout
6266,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"the two poems) between the wishes of the two, both passionately and"
6267,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"beautifully put, and paused a moment to grasp the full meaning. But"
6268,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"only a moment, for I was too interested in this enchanting symphony"
6269,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,to wait longer. Already the poet in spider’s form that was the more
6270,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"delicate, beautiful, and pathetic was continuing.--"
6271,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6272,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In a distant western city
6273,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Far away from that loved spot,"
6274,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I began the strife in earnest,"
6275,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Not complaining of my lot;
6276,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,For in two years from our parting
6277,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I’d return and claim my own.
6278,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"So I worked and dreamed and waited,"
6279,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Cheered by that one thought alone.
6280,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Fortune smiled on my endeavors,"
6281,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And each week a message brought
6282,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,From that one beside the seashore
6283,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Who was ever in my thought.
6284,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6285,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"But at last the darkness gathered,--"
6286,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Clouds as dark as Ethiop’s land.
6287,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,One dark day there came a letter
6288,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Written by a stranger’s hand.
6289,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Evylyn, it said, was drooping,"
6290,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Drooping, fading very fast;"
6291,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Though she would admit no danger,"
6292,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Her short life would soon be past.
6293,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Many months, the message stated,"
6294,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,She had faded day by day;
6295,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Yet to me each cherished letter
6296,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Had been cheerful, bright, and gay."
6297,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6298,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I found myself so in sympathy with the two spiders--or poets and
6299,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"musicians, rather, in spider form--that I pitied them deeply,"
6300,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,and--shall I say?--loved them. The first melodist continued more
6301,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"mournfully, and to slower, sad, and muffled music.--"
6302,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6303,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,All the spring and summer long
6304,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Did I list the seraph-song.
6305,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,But when autumn came around
6306,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"With a sighing, mournful sound,"
6307,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,My sweet blossom faded fast;
6308,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"And my radiant, fond Lenore"
6309,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Yielded to the chilling blast
6310,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those autumn days of yore!
6311,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6312,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,As the flowers fade and die
6313,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"’Neath the cold and cloudless sky,"
6314,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,So my Darling drooped and died!
6315,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And my dear intended bride
6316,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,With a long and last farewell
6317,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Crossed the silent waters o’er
6318,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,While we tolled her funeral knell
6319,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those parting days of yore!
6320,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6321,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In the deepest dearth of night
6322,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"When the starry dome was bright,"
6323,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Came the angels round her bed;
6324,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And they numbered with the dead
6325,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"My angelic, radiant Love"
6326,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Whom the seraphs named Lenore,"
6327,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Wafting here away above,--"
6328,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Saddest, saddest days of yore!"
6329,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6330,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I am not a man who easily gives way to feeling; but the plaintiveness
6331,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,of the music and the mournfulness of the simple words made me forget
6332,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"the mysterious bard that was weaving this tale of pathos, and I bowed"
6333,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"my head in sorrow, with my heart full of pity and love for both the"
6334,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"afflicted and the noble-hearted sweet departed. As I did so, the"
6335,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"threnodic notes, as if dying away in the echoing distance of the blue"
6336,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"dome above, thus came from the heart of the other minne-singer.--"
6337,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6338,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,With an aching heart I started
6339,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"For her home beside the sea,"
6340,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Once again to see my Darling
6341,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Ere Death snatched his prize from me.
6342,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,But a cruel fate hung o’er me;
6343,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Ere I reached that eastern home,"
6344,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Her angelic soul was wafted
6345,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Far beyond the starlit dome.
6346,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Through the distant shining portals,"
6347,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Breathing of eternal love,"
6348,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Passed my Evylyn, my treasure,"
6349,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,To the brighter world above.
6350,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6351,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Surely, surely, I thought, these breathers of harmony cannot be ugly"
6352,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,spiders. They are too human--or shall I say too divine?--for that. I
6353,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"had been so absorbed in the two songs that, strange perhaps to say,"
6354,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"though I think not, I had scarcely noticed the spiders themselves nor"
6355,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,their illuminated web-woven words. I felt now that the songs were
6356,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"nearly ended; and through tear-dimmed eyes, I looked once more at the"
6357,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"page on my desk. How strangely brighter the light seemed to be, yet so"
6358,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,softer!
6359,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6360,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Could it be possible! Wasn’t this, after all, some dream?--I dashed the"
6361,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"tears from my eyes with my left hand.--No, I was wide awake. No doubt"
6362,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"about that. There, too, that light from the words was even brighter"
6363,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,than when it was seen through my tears.
6364,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6365,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Surely, surely, these were not spiders; but spirits, rather, in this"
6366,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"disguise. As this thought flew through my brain, I removed the fifth"
6367,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"finished page of manuscript, when lo! I almost screamed for mercy that"
6368,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,no more revelations be made to me. For the spider glided to the top of
6369,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"the new page, and as he did so, I saw and marveled how much smaller"
6370,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"he had grown, as if he had spun his whole body away in his glowing"
6371,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"web. But still stranger transformation: All about him, like a spirit"
6372,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"embodying the body, was a dim halo of light, such as a star often forms"
6373,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"of the mists, that doubtless had been forming from the first although"
6374,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I had not noticed it, having been too absorbed in the songs themselves."
6375,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6376,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"As I looked steadily, transfixed by this new revelation, I saw that"
6377,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"haloing light, as true as I live, shape itself in a half human form;"
6378,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,and like a light-enhaloed star moving across the scroll of the Almighty
6379,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"in spheric music set to angel words, this transformed being of light"
6380,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,trembled across the page before me and trailed these gold-enlighted
6381,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,words through the solemn rhythm of the olden melody.--
6382,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6383,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"By the babbling little brook,"
6384,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"In a quiet, shaded nook,"
6385,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Sleeps my loved and lost one now.
6386,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Over pallid lip and brow
6387,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Grow the scented flowers wild
6388,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Bright as when I wandered o’er
6389,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,This same spot when but a child
6390,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In those happy days of yore.
6391,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6392,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Many years have come and gone
6393,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Since that face I’ve looked upon;
6394,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Many weary paths I’ve trod
6395,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Since we laid her ’neath the sod.
6396,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Still I wander, sad and lone;"
6397,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Still my heart is grieved and sore,"
6398,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,For she sleeps beneath the stone
6399,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Since those happy days of yore.
6400,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6401,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Thoughts of the dead always affect me beyond expression. The thought
6402,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"of the death of this darling girl, glorious in her own true heart, I"
6403,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"can but feel, and glorified even more by the unfailing constancy and"
6404,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"eternal love of him who, grown old and gray, still keeps her ever in"
6405,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"his heart, so affected me that my own heart seemed almost broken."
6406,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I could endure no more, and turned away. But as I did so,--O sweet"
6407,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,angels of mercy! was there no escape?--there the other heaven-gifted
6408,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"musician, spirit-embodied, halo-enshrouded like the first, met my eyes,"
6409,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"and I was forced against my will to listen to the most plaintive, most"
6410,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,pathetic melody that had yet grieved my heart.--
6411,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6412,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"In a grave down by the seashore,"
6413,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,She was laid by loving hands
6414,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Where old ocean sings a requiem
6415,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Evermore upon the sands.
6416,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,There the summer tide is flowing
6417,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"As I stand upon the shore,"
6418,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And it calls up sacred mem’ries
6419,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Of the happy times of yore.
6420,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Fragments of a wreck are drifting
6421,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,On the surface of a wave--
6422,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Emblem of my hopes and prospects,"
6423,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Wrecked, and lying in her grave."
6424,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6425,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Many weary years have vanished,"
6426,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Years of wand’ring, sad and lone,"
6427,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Since that pure angelic spirit
6428,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Joined the seraphs round the throne.
6429,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"O’er her grave beside the ocean,"
6430,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Lovingly the stars still shine,"
6431,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,While the tide’s wild song of gladness
6432,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Seems to bear her voice divine.
6433,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Oft in dreams I see my lost one,"
6434,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Hear her voice as soft and low
6435,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,As a strain of far-off music;--
6436,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,But the dawn brings back my woe.
6437,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6438,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Bowed with unutterable grief,--grief that was so severe that it choked"
6439,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"back every tear into my heart,--I buried my head in my arms to shut"
6440,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"out both sight and sound, and wept as tearless grief alone can weep."
6441,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"The angel-images of the two that had gone Home, forever to await"
6442,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"the happier marriage in eternal union there, I saw looking down"
6443,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"compassionately, while the two mourners left behind were constantly"
6444,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,reaching upwards toward those loved ones beyond their ken in the dim
6445,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"unknown, and sometimes almost touching the finger-tips of the hands"
6446,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"unseen! Yes; and the music! I heard it over, and over, and over again,"
6447,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"sometimes near, sometimes far, always sweet and tremulous, sometimes"
6448,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"sounding in my ear, sometimes dying away and echoing back from the"
6449,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,dome of that Home above.
6450,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6451,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"When again my fevered eyes looked upon the page, I wondered if it could"
6452,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,be that these embodiments of both verse and music could be changing
6453,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"so rapidly, or if the change had been going on constantly without my"
6454,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,notice. Both transformed--I know not now what to call them--had now
6455,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,become so small that I could scarcely distinguish their bodies through
6456,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,the spirit-like halo. And that halo every moment grew more and more
6457,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"human--no, not human; but, though an embodying spirit, it grew more and"
6458,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,more like a disembodied human soul. Less and less visible became the
6459,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"body of each, more and more like a human soul became the halo of each"
6460,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,as the first wove itself away into the final web.--
6461,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6462,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Oh, my heart is sad and lone"
6463,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And it sighs with heaving groan
6464,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,As it dreams its dreams of woe
6465,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Of the silent long ago.
6466,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,But I’ve reached the river’s brink;
6467,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Soon I’ll dip the golden oar,"
6468,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,And beneath the waves will sink
6469,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,All those happy days of yore.
6470,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6471,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Soon I’ll greet my bright Lenore
6472,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Where we’ll meet to part no more;
6473,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Soon I’ll reach the golden sands
6474,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Where I’ll clasp her angel hands;
6475,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Soon I’ll kiss her seraph brow
6476,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"On that bright angelic shore,"
6477,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Where I’ll dream no more, as now,"
6478,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Of those happy days of yore.
6479,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6480,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"The two spirits, thus transforming, were passing away, slipping,"
6481,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"slipping away from me back into the mysteriousness whence they came, I"
6482,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"felt, as both moved across the page to dirge-like yet a kind of happy"
6483,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,and hope-inspiring music. The music of each was so blended with that of
6484,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,the other that I could scarcely distinguish the words of the two as the
6485,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,second soul-dreamer mused through the melody.--
6486,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6487,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Lost! ah lost!--But not forever:
6488,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I have reached the golden strand;
6489,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Soon beyond the crystal ocean
6490,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,We will wander hand in hand;
6491,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Soon across the deep, dark waters"
6492,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I will go to claim my own
6493,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"From among the shining angels,"
6494,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Where she waits for me alone.
6495,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,We will part no more forever
6496,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Underneath that heavenly dome;
6497,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Love and joy shall reign together
6498,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,In that bright eternal home.
6499,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6500,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"But look--look!--there, there just before you. See! see it struggling"
6501,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"to rise away. Oh, what wonderful transformation can this be!"
6502,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6503,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"As both neared the close, their bodies grew imperceptible, the"
6504,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"web-woven words more and more brightly illuminated, and the haloing"
6505,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"spirit larger, and larger, more and more distinct, yet more and more"
6506,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"attenuated, until--no, no! it--but yes! I must believe it, must believe"
6507,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,my eyes!--each took on the form of an angel! As the last word of each
6508,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"was woven, simultaneously, and as the low, faint, plaintive echoes of"
6509,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,the music went trembling through the blue distance that still trembles
6510,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"in unison with the hearts of millions, the two _meistersingers_,"
6511,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"perfect in angel form with a rarer beauty than I ever saw before, the"
6512,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"rarest beauty I ever expect to see, shone radiantly in the night for a"
6513,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"moment, like a glory struck out of darkness by a beam from heaven, and"
6514,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,vanished like that glory passing out of darkness into heaven again.
6515,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"With my eyes following these disembodied embodiments of Beauty, and my"
6516,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"palms out-reaching toward them, thus I sat until, when their passing"
6517,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,glory at the same time closed the portals through which they vanished
6518,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"and gave the keys to memory, my nerves relaxed, the intense mingled"
6519,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"pain and rapture, which had never ceased, seemed to snap my very"
6520,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"heart-chords, and consciousness slid like lead into the lethean flow of"
6521,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,the river of oblivion.
6522,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6523,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"How long I sat there, drowned in unrefreshing forgetfulness allied"
6524,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"to sleep, I have no recollection, and no possible means of knowing."
6525,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"When again I opened my eyes, the morning was far spent. There was a"
6526,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"dull pain in my head, but the circumstances I have just related were"
6527,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,all so vivid that the whole scene instantly flashed across my mind. I
6528,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,thought surely it must be a dream. Could it be? I was sitting in my
6529,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,night-dress. I got up from my chair and went to my bed-room. There was
6530,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"my bed, just as I had left it when I rose to follow the strange spirit"
6531,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,that controlled me. I went to the wall where I had seen the spider.
6532,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"True enough, there was the thread, but no longer illuminated, just"
6533,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,where I had seen it. I put my hand to my forehead as one often does in
6534,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"wondering. When I removed it, there, clinging to my forefinger, was"
6535,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"the web that had clung to my forehead. No, I had not been asleep and"
6536,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,dreamed all this; that was plain enough. I returned to my chair. There
6537,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"on my desk, as I involuntarily glanced at the well-remembered spot, I"
6538,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,saw a still more remarkable confirmation of my having been awake; for
6539,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"there lay the whole poem that I had seen woven by the first spirit, as"
6540,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,perfect in every way as if it had been written by human hand. But the
6541,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"characters were no longer illuminated. They had burnt into the paper,"
6542,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"and were as black as my own ink. They were all made out, too, in my"
6543,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"own style of handwriting, though I declare and affirm to all the world"
6544,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,that never before this occurrence had I written one line of poetry.
6545,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,Perhaps it would have been better for me and for you if I had stopped
6546,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,with this--palmed it off as my own on account of the similarity of
6547,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,handwriting; and if I had never trifled with the tricks of the muses
6548,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,thereafter.
6549,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6550,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I looked on my desk for the other poem, but alas! it could not be"
6551,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"found; for, as I have said before, it was only _psychologically_"
6552,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"present to me, while it was _really_ present to some one else. In a"
6553,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,few days I had the most remarkable confirmation of this--even more
6554,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,remarkable than what I have related in the preceding.
6555,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6556,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,By the very next mail (I was teaching in the country and got my mail
6557,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"but once a week, on Saturday) I received a letter from my old chum,"
6558,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"dated May 8, 1885. As I opened it, behold! that identical poem that I"
6559,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,had in my mind seen wrought by the second spirit of beauty fell on my
6560,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"table. In a letter of sixteen quarto pages, he told one substantially"
6561,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,the same experience of himself with two spirit-singers--one of them
6562,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"present, the other psychologically present, each unconscious of the"
6563,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"other, yet each influencing the other in some indefinable way--as I"
6564,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,have here related.
6565,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6566,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"In speaking of the vanishing of the two spirit-forms, he wrote:--"
6567,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6568,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,“I firmly believe those two spirits were none other than the
6569,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,angel-forms of the two maidens the poems celebrate; that they have
6570,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,woven their spirits of beauty into these two embodiments of verse that
6571,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"we mortals may be the better for it; and that, when they vanished, they"
6572,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"entered these two poems, where they still abide.”"
6573,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6574,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"Strange, but this is the same thought that I had had, and still do"
6575,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"have. I most sincerely believe it is the only correct conclusion,"
6576,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"though I cannot solve the mysteries that are connected with it. Indeed,"
6577,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,it would be sacrilege to attempt it.
6578,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6579,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I still have these original manuscripts that were thus mysteriously
6580,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,wrought. They are lying here on the desk before me as I write; and as
6581,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I glance across this page at them, the whole scene of that memorable"
6582,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"night, more vivid, far, far more vivid than my pen has delineated it"
6583,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"for you, comes flashing across my brain. In this quick, bright light"
6584,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"of memory, reason marshals the long line of causes that produced this"
6585,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,psychological phenomenon; I follow the approaching lines with my
6586,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"mind’s eye, until I am lost in the dim distance of their vanishing"
6587,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"perspective, then return, follow again, only to lose myself in the same"
6588,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"unfathomable mystery, and so again and again. Though I know some of"
6589,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"the causes that produced it, I cannot reach the hidden ones. I could"
6590,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,almost fancy still that I had dreamed all this did not these original
6591,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,manuscripts before me constantly remind me of the reality of what I
6592,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,have here set down. They are free for the inspection of all who wish
6593,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,to verify the facts I have related.
6594,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6595,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I challenge the world to produce two such similar poems, good, bad, or"
6596,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"indifferent, written under such remarkable circumstances."
6597,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6598,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"The events I have here recorded are the events of my boyhood, or early"
6599,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"manhood, rather, faithfully told. I have long hesitated to publish them"
6600,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,for fear that there might be a few in these days of fiction who would
6601,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,doubt their reality. But what makes them a hundredfold more wonderful
6602,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,to me is the truth of all their seemingly impossible facts.
6603,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6604,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"My friend, you think this a strange, strange story, I know. Indeed,"
6605,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"I think so too; far more strange to me than to you, for I have felt"
6606,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,the truth of it and you have only read it. As true as these two poems
6607,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"exist, the circumstances under which they were written are far, far"
6608,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"more strange to me than I can possibly make the story; far, far more"
6609,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"strange to me than the weirdest, most wonderful story pen can write."
6610,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,
6611,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,I have therefore published this account of an incident of my life
6612,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,that it may please some with the strange facts that they will take
6613,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,for mere fancy; that it may waken some to the knowledge that in our
6614,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"most rational moments we are by no means independent, our minds are"
6615,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"by no means our own, but are influenced by circumstances, by the"
6616,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"psychological action of the minds of our most intimate friends, and"
6617,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,by the spiritual power within us and at the same time above us; that
6618,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,it may teach others that out of the most despised creatures of God’s
6619,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,"making and care, the Soul of Beauty may come and wed itself to Use by"
6620,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,weaving its life into an angel-image of Love that shall dwell in the
6621,A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.,human heart forever.
