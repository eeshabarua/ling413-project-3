114,INTRODUCTION.,
115,INTRODUCTION.,Pike County Ballads and other poems in this volume by Colonel John Hay
116,INTRODUCTION.,represent in the best manner the spirit of our strong and independent
117,INTRODUCTION.,sister-land across the Atlantic.  Pike County Ballads do full justice to
118,INTRODUCTION.,"the raw material in the United States, and show a loyal temper in the"
119,INTRODUCTION.,rough.  The other pieces show how the love of freedom speaks through
120,INTRODUCTION.,"finer spirits of the land, and, dealing with realities, can turn a life"
121,INTRODUCTION.,of action into music.
122,INTRODUCTION.,
123,INTRODUCTION.,Colonel Hay has lived always in vigorous relation with the full life of
124,INTRODUCTION.,the people whose best mind his poems represent.  He is descended from a
125,INTRODUCTION.,"Scottish soldier, a John Hay, who, at the beginning of the last century,"
126,INTRODUCTION.,"left his country to take service under the Elector-Palatine, and whose"
127,INTRODUCTION.,son went afterwards with his family to settle among the Kentucky
128,INTRODUCTION.,"pioneers.  Dr. Charles Hay was the father of John Hay the poet, who was"
129,INTRODUCTION.,"born on the 8th of October 1838, in the heart of the United States, at"
130,INTRODUCTION.,Salem in Indiana.   When twenty years old he graduated at the
131,INTRODUCTION.,"neighbouring Brown University, where his fellow-students valued his skill"
132,INTRODUCTION.,"as a writer.   Then he studied for the Bar, and he was called to the Bar"
133,INTRODUCTION.,"three years later, at Springfield, Illinois."
134,INTRODUCTION.,
135,INTRODUCTION.,"At Springfield, Abraham Lincoln practised as a barrister.  Shrewd,"
136,INTRODUCTION.,"lively, earnest, honest, he grudged help to a rogue.  In a criminal case,"
137,INTRODUCTION.,"when evidence threw unexpected light upon a client's character, Abraham"
138,INTRODUCTION.,"Lincoln said suddenly to his junior, ""Swett, the man is guilty; you"
139,INTRODUCTION.,"defend him, I can't.""  In another case, when a piece of rascality in his"
140,INTRODUCTION.,"client came out, Abraham Lincoln left his junior in possession of the"
141,INTRODUCTION.,"case and went to his hotel.  To the judge, who sent for him, he replied"
142,INTRODUCTION.,"that he had found his hands were very dirty, and had gone away to get"
143,INTRODUCTION.,them clean.  Almost immediately after John Hay's call to the Bar at
144,INTRODUCTION.,"Springfield he was chosen by Abraham Lincoln, newly made President, to go"
145,INTRODUCTION.,"with him to Washington.  At Washington, Hay acted as Assistant-Secretary,"
146,INTRODUCTION.,"and was also, in the Civil War, aide-de-camp to President Lincoln."
147,INTRODUCTION.,Throughout that momentous struggle he was actively employed on the side
148,INTRODUCTION.,of the North at the headquarters and on the field of battle.  He served
149,INTRODUCTION.,"for a time under Generals Hunter and Gillmore, became a Colonel in the"
150,INTRODUCTION.,"army of the North, and served also as Assistant Adjutant-General.  John"
151,INTRODUCTION.,Hay had in that struggle three brothers and two brothers-in-law serving
152,INTRODUCTION.,also in the field.
153,INTRODUCTION.,
154,INTRODUCTION.,"In 1890 there was published, in ten volumes, at New York, by the New York"
155,INTRODUCTION.,"Century Company, ""Abraham Lincoln, a History:  by John G. Nicolay and"
156,INTRODUCTION.,"John Hay.""  This was, with fresh material inserted, a collection of"
157,INTRODUCTION.,chapters that had been published in The Century Magazine from November
158,INTRODUCTION.,"1886 to the beginning of 1890.  The friends, who worked equally together"
159,INTRODUCTION.,"upon this large record, said, ""We knew Mr. Lincoln intimately before his"
160,INTRODUCTION.,election to the Presidency.  We came from Illinois to Washington with
161,INTRODUCTION.,"him, and remained at his side and in his service--separately or"
162,INTRODUCTION.,"together--until the day of his death."""
163,INTRODUCTION.,
164,INTRODUCTION.,"Abroad, as at home, Colonel Hay has been active in the service of his"
165,INTRODUCTION.,"country.  In 1865 he went to Paris as Secretary of Legation, and after"
166,INTRODUCTION.,remaining two years in that office he went as Charge-d'Affaires for the
167,INTRODUCTION.,"United States to Vienna.  After a year at Vienna, Colonel Hay went to"
168,INTRODUCTION.,Madrid as Secretary of Legation under General Daniel Sickles.  In 1870 he
169,INTRODUCTION.,"returned to the United States, and was for the next five years an"
170,INTRODUCTION.,"editorial writer for the New York Tribune.  During seven months, when"
171,INTRODUCTION.,"Whitelaw Reid was in Europe, Colonel Hay was editor in chief."
172,INTRODUCTION.,
173,INTRODUCTION.,"It was for The Tribune that Hay wrote ""The Pike County Ballads,"" which"
174,INTRODUCTION.,"were first reprinted separately in 1871, and are placed first in the"
175,INTRODUCTION.,"collection of his poems.  In the same year he published his ""Castilian"
176,INTRODUCTION.,"Days,"" inspired by residence in Spain."
177,INTRODUCTION.,
178,INTRODUCTION.,"In 1876 Colonel Hay removed from New York to Cleveland, Ohio.  He then"
179,INTRODUCTION.,"ceased to take part in the editing of The Tribune, but continued friendly"
180,INTRODUCTION.,service as a writer.  From 1879 to 1881 Colonel Hay served under
181,INTRODUCTION.,President Hayes as Assistant-Secretary of State in the Government of the
182,INTRODUCTION.,United States.  In 1881 he was President of the International Sanitary
183,INTRODUCTION.,"Congress at Washington.  Since that time he has been active, with John G."
184,INTRODUCTION.,"Nicolay, in the preparation and production of the full Memoir of Abraham"
185,INTRODUCTION.,"Lincoln, now completed, that will take high rank among the records of a"
186,INTRODUCTION.,"war which, in its issues, touched the future of the world, perhaps, more"
187,INTRODUCTION.,"nearly than any war since Waterloo, not even excepting the great struggle"
188,INTRODUCTION.,which ended at Sedan.
