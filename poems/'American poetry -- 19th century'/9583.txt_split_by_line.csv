218,KENOZA LAKE.,
219,KENOZA LAKE.,"This beautiful lake in East Haverhill was the ""Great Pond"" the"
220,KENOZA LAKE.,writer's boyhood. In 1859 a movement was made for improving its

507,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"The good round about us we need not refuse,"

536,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
537,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Three shades at this moment seem walking her strand,"

547,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,But the golden sands run out: occasions like these
548,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Glide swift into shadow, like sails on the seas"

551,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
552,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,"Forgive me, dear friends, if my vagrant thoughts seem"

555,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,The sunshine and rain of our brief April day.
556,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
557,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,There are moments in life when the lip and the eye
558,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,Try the question of whether to smile or to cry;

576,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,
577,THE QUAKER ALUMNI.,In and out let the young life as steadily flow
