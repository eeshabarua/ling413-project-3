58,INSCRIBED,"To the Elect of Love,--or side-by-side"
59,INSCRIBED,"In raptest ecstasy, or sundered wide"

66,INSCRIBED,"So were I but a minstrel, deft"
67,INSCRIBED,"At weaving, with the trembling strings"
68,INSCRIBED,"Of my glad harp, the warp and weft"
69,INSCRIBED,"Of rondels such as rapture sings,--"
70,INSCRIBED,"I'd loop my lyre across my breast,"
71,INSCRIBED,Nor stay me till my knee found rest
72,INSCRIBED,In midnight banks of bud and flower
73,INSCRIBED,Beneath my lady's lattice-bower.

75,INSCRIBED,"And there, drenched with the teary dews,"
76,INSCRIBED,I'd woo her with such wondrous art
77,INSCRIBED,As well might stanch the songs that ooze
78,INSCRIBED,Out of the mockbird's breaking heart;
79,INSCRIBED,"So light, so tender, and so sweet"
80,INSCRIBED,"Should be the words I would repeat,"
81,INSCRIBED,"Her casement, on my gradual sight,"
82,INSCRIBED,Would blossom as a lily might.

358,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
359,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
360,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"As one who cons at evening o'er an album all alone,"
361,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known,"
362,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"So I turn the leaves of fancy till, in shadowy design,"
363,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine.
364,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
365,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,[Illustration: (AND I LIGHT MY PIPE IN SILENCE)]
366,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
367,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise,"
368,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"As I turn it low to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes,"
369,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And light my pipe in silence, save a sigh that seems to yoke"
370,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke.
371,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
372,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,'Tis a fragrant retrospection--for the loving thoughts that start
373,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Into being are like perfume from the blossom of the heart;
374,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine--
375,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,When my truant fancy wanders with that old sweetheart of mine.
376,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
377,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Though I hear, beneath my study, like a fluttering of wings,"
378,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"The voices of my children, and the mother as she sings,"
379,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me any theme
380,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,When Care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dream.
381,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
382,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"In fact, to speak in earnest, I believe it adds a charm"
383,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm--
384,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,For I find an extra flavor in Memory's mellow wine
385,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine.

390,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
391,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"A face of lily-beauty, with a form of airy grace,"
392,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Floats out of my tobacco as the genii from the vase;
393,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes
394,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies.
395,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
396,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,I can see the pink sunbonnet and the little checkered dress
397,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,She wore when first I kissed her and she answered the caress
398,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"With the written declaration that, ""as surely as the vine"
399,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Grew round the stump,"" she loved me--that old sweetheart of mine."
400,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
401,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,[Illustration: (WHEN FIRST I KISSED HER)]
402,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
403,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand,"
404,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,As we used to talk together of the future we had planned--
405,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"When I should be a poet, and with nothing else to do"
406,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,But write the tender verses that she set the music to:
407,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
408,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,When we should live together in a cozy little cot
409,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Hid in a nest of roses, with a fairy garden-spot,"
410,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Where the vines were ever fruited, and the weather ever fine,"
411,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine:
412,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
413,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,[Illustration]
414,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
415,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"When I should be her lover forever and a day,"
416,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray;
417,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And we should be so happy that when either's lips were dumb
418,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,They would not smile in Heaven till the other's kiss had come.
419,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
420,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,*       *       *       *       *
421,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
422,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"But, ah! my dream is broken by a step upon the stair,"
423,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And the door is softly opened, and--my wife is standing there;"
424,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Yet with eagerness and rapture all my visions I resign
425,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,To greet the living presence of that old sweetheart of mine.

510,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
511,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
512,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,How tired I am! I sink down all alone
513,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Here by the wayside of the Present. Lo,"
514,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Even as a child I hide my face and moan--
515,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,A little girl that may no farther go;
516,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,The path above me only seems to grow
517,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"More rugged, climbing still, and ever briered"
518,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,With keener thorns of pain than these below;
519,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And O the bleeding feet that falter so
520,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And are so very tired!
521,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
522,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Why, I have journeyed from the far-off Lands"
523,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Of Babyhood--where baby-lilies blew
524,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Their trumpets in mine ears, and filled my hands"
525,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"With treasures of perfume and honey-dew,"
526,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And where the orchard shadows ever drew
527,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Their cool arms round me when my cheeks were fired
528,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"With too much joy, and lulled mine eyelids to,"
529,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And only let the starshine trickle through
530,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"In sprays, when I was tired!"
531,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
532,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Yet I remember, when the butterfly"
533,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Went flickering about me like a flame
534,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"That quenched itself in roses suddenly,"
535,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"How oft I wished that _I_ might blaze the same,"
536,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And in some rose-wreath nestle with my name,"
537,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,While all the world looked on it and admired.--
538,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Poor moth!--Along my wavering flight toward fame
539,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"The winds drive backward, and my wings are lame"
540,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And broken, bruised and tired!"
541,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
542,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I hardly know the path from those old times;
543,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I know at first it was a smoother one
544,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Than this that hurries past me now, and climbs"
545,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"So high, its far cliffs even hide the sun"
546,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And shroud in gloom my journey scarce begun.
547,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I could not do quite all the world required--
548,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"I could not do quite all I should have done,"
549,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And in my eagerness I have outrun
550,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,My strength--and I am tired....
551,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
552,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Just tired! But when of old I had the stay
553,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Of mother-hands, O very sweet indeed"
554,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,It was to dream that all the weary way
555,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I should but follow where I now must lead--
556,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"For long ago they left me in my need,"
557,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And, groping on alone, I tripped and mired"
558,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Among rank grasses where the serpents breed
559,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,In knotted coils about the feet of speed.--
560,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,There first it was I tired.
561,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
562,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And yet I staggered on, and bore my load"
563,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Right gallantly: The sun, in summer-time,"
564,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,In lazy belts came slipping down the road
565,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"To woo me on, with many a glimmering rhyme"
566,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Rained from the golden rim of some fair clime,"
567,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"That, hovering beyond the clouds, inspired"
568,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,My failing heart with fancies so sublime
569,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"I half forgot my path of dust and grime,"
570,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Though I was growing tired.
571,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
572,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And there were many voices cheering me:
573,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I listened to sweet praises where the wind
574,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Went laughing o'er my shoulders gleefully
575,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And scattering my love-songs far behind;--
576,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Until, at last, I thought the world so kind--"
577,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,So rich in all my yearning soul desired--
578,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"So generous--so loyally inclined,"
579,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I grew to love and trust it.... I was blind--
580,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Yea, blind as I was tired!"
581,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
582,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And yet one hand held me in creature-touch:
583,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And O, how fair it was, how true and strong,"
584,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"How it did hold my heart up like a crutch,"
585,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Till, in my dreams, I joyed to walk along"
586,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"The toilsome way, contented with a song--"
587,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"'Twas all of earthly things I had acquired,"
588,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And 'twas enough, I feigned, or right or wrong,"
589,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Since, binding me to man--a mortal thong--"
590,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"It stayed me, growing tired...."
591,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
592,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Yea, I had e'en resigned me to the strait"
593,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Of earthly rulership--had bowed my head
594,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Acceptant of the master-mind--the great
595,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"One lover--lord of all,--the perfected"
596,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Kiss-comrade of my soul;--had stammering said
597,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,My prayers to him;--all--all that he desired
598,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,I rendered sacredly as we were wed.--
599,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Nay--nay!--'twas but a myth I worshippéd.--
600,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And--God of love!--how tired!
601,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
602,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,[Illustration: (AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO)]
603,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
604,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"For, O my friends, to lose the latest grasp--"
605,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,To feel the last hope slipping from its hold--
606,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,To feel the one fond hand within your clasp
607,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Fall slack, and loosen with a touch so cold"
608,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Its pressure may not warm you as of old
609,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Before the light of love had thus expired--
610,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"To know your tears are worthless, though they rolled"
611,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Their torrents out in molten drops of gold.--
612,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,God's pity! I am tired!
613,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,
614,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And I must rest.--Yet do not say ""She _died_,"""
615,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"In speaking of me, sleeping here alone."
616,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"I kiss the grassy grave I sink beside,"
617,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,And close mine eyes in slumber all mine own:
618,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Hereafter I shall neither sob nor moan
619,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"Nor murmur one complaint;--all I desired,"
620,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,"And failed in life to find, will now be known--"
621,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,So let me dream. Good night! And on the stone
622,AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO,Say simply: She was tired.

731,I,"O sweet, sweet face above me, turn again"
732,I,"And leave me! I had cried, but that an ache"
733,I,Within my throat so gripped it I could make
734,I,"No sound but a thick sobbing. Cowering so,"
735,I,I felt her light hand laid
736,I,Upon my hair--a touch that ne'er before
737,I,"Had tamed me thus, all soothed and unafraid--"
738,I,It seemed the touch the children used to know
739,I,"When Christ was here, so dear it was--so dear,--"
740,I,At once I loved her as the leaves love dew
741,I,In midmost summer when the days are new.
742,I,"Barely an hour I knew her, yet a curl"
743,I,Of silken sunshine did she clip for me
744,I,"Out of the bright May-morning of her hair,"
745,I,"And bound and gave it to me laughingly,"
746,I,"And caught my hands and called me ""_Little girl_,"""
747,I,"Tiptoeing, as she spoke, to kiss me there!"
748,I,And I stood dazed and dumb for very stress
749,I,Of my great happiness.
750,I,"She plucked me by the gown, nor saw how mean"
751,I,The raiment--drew me with her everywhere:
752,I,Smothered her face in tufts of grasses green:
753,I,Put up her dainty hands and peeped between
754,I,Her fingers at the blossoms--crooned and talked
755,I,"To them in strange, glad whispers, as we walked,--"
756,I,"Said _this_ one was her angel mother--_this_,"
757,I,"Her baby-sister--come back, for a kiss,"
758,I,"Clean from the Good-World!--smiled and kissed them, then"
759,I,Closed her soft eyes and kissed them o'er again.
760,I,"And so did she beguile me--so we played,--"
761,I,"She was the dazzling Shine--I, the dark Shade--"
762,I,"And we did mingle like to these, and thus,"
763,I,"Together, made"
764,I,"The perfect summer, pure and glorious."
765,I,"So blent we, till a harsh voice broke upon"
766,I,"Our happiness.--She, startled as a fawn,"
767,I,"Cried, ""Oh, 'tis Father!""--all the blossoms gone"
768,I,From out her cheeks as those from out her grasp.--
769,I,Harsher the voice came:--She could only gasp
770,I,"Affrightedly, ""Good-bye!--good-bye! good-bye!"""
771,I,"And lo, I stood alone, with that harsh cry"
772,I,Ringing a new and unknown sense of shame
773,I,"Through soul and frame,"
774,I,"And, with wet eyes, repeating o'er and o'er,--"
775,I,"""He called her in from me and shut the door!"""

777,I,
778,II,II
779,II,
780,II,He called her in from me and shut the door!
781,II,And I went wandering alone again--
782,II,"So lonely--O so very lonely then,"
783,II,"I thought no little sallow star, alone"
784,II,"In all a world of twilight, e'er had known"
785,II,Such utter loneliness. But that I wore
786,II,Above my heart that gleaming tress of hair
787,II,"To lighten up the night of my despair,"
788,II,I think I might have groped into my grave
789,II,Nor cared to wave
790,II,The ferns above it with a breath of prayer.
791,II,"And how I hungered for the sweet, sweet face"
792,II,That bent above me in my hiding-place
793,II,That day amid the grasses there beside
794,II,"Her pleasant home!--""Her _pleasant_ home!"" I sighed,"
795,II,Remembering;--then shut my teeth and feigned
796,II,"The harsh voice calling _me_,--then clinched my nails"
797,II,"So deeply in my palms, the sharp wounds pained,"
798,II,"And tossed my face toward heaven, as one who pales"
799,II,"In splendid martyrdom, with soul serene,"
800,II,As near to God as high the guillotine.
801,II,And I had _envied_ her? Not that--O no!
802,II,But I had longed for some sweet haven so!--
803,II,Wherein the tempest-beaten heart might ride
804,II,"Sometimes at peaceful anchor, and abide"
805,II,"Where those that loved me touched me with their hands,"
806,II,"And looked upon me with glad eyes, and slipped"
807,II,"Smooth fingers o'er my brow, and lulled the strands"
808,II,"Of my wild tresses, as they backward tipped"
809,II,My yearning face and kissed it satisfied.
810,II,"Then bitterly I murmured as before,--"
811,II,"""He called her in from me and shut the door!"""

819,III,"I held myself from her, the greater fain"
820,III,Was I to look upon her face again;--
821,III,At last--at last--half conscious where my feet
822,III,"Were faring, I stood waist-deep in the sweet"
823,III,Green grasses there where she
824,III,First came to me.--
825,III,"The very blossoms she had plucked that day,"
826,III,"And, at her father's voice, had cast away,"
827,III,"Around me lay,"
828,III,Still bright and blooming in these eyes of mine;
829,III,"And as I gathered each one eagerly,"
830,III,I pressed it to my lips and drank the wine
831,III,Her kisses left there for the honey-bee.
832,III,"Then, after I had laid them with the tress"

834,III,[Illustration: (WHEN SHE FIRST CAME TO ME)]
835,III,
836,III,"Of her bright hair with lingering tenderness,"
837,III,"I, turning, crept on to the hedge that bound"

839,III,Was never sign of her!--The windows all
840,III,Were blinded; and I heard no rippling fall

842,III,"But clutching to the tangled grasses, caught"
843,III,A sound as though a strong man bowed his head
844,III,And sobbed alone--unloved--uncomforted!--
845,III,And then straightway before
846,III,"My tearless eyes, all vividly, was wrought"
847,III,A vision that is with me evermore:--
848,III,"A little girl that lies asleep, nor hears"
849,III,Nor heeds not any voice nor fall of tears.--

1206,THE LOST PATH,"Laughed lightly as they loitered down the lane,"

1216,THE LOST PATH,"Stared wistfully, and from their mellow bells"

1342,HOW IT HAPPENED,Would have the child so riconciled and happy-like 'at we
1343,HOW IT HAPPENED,Felt lonesomer 'n ever when she'd put her bonnet on
1344,HOW IT HAPPENED,And say she'd railly haf to be a-gittin' back to John!
1345,HOW IT HAPPENED,
1346,HOW IT HAPPENED,"I got to thinkin' of her, as I say,--and more and more"
1347,HOW IT HAPPENED,"I'd think of her dependence, and the burdens 'at she bore,--"
1348,HOW IT HAPPENED,"Her parents both a-bein' dead, and all her sisters gone"
1349,HOW IT HAPPENED,"And married off, and her a-livin' there alone with John--"

2246,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,

2249,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"Fer they all died little babies; and 'twas one o' Mother's ways,"

2274,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,I was ridin' home with Mary at the closin' o' the day--
2275,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"A-chawin' straws and thinkin', in a lover's lazy way!"
2276,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2277,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,And Mary's cheeks was burnin' like the sunset down the lane:

2286,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2287,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"But it's jest as true as preachin'!--fer that was _a sister's_ kiss,"

2306,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"And I tried to raise and meet her, but I couldn't, with a vague"

2311,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"And wonder what was left _me_ worth livin' fer below,"

2313,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2314,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,And my thoughts was as rebellious as the folks was good and kind

2318,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2319,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,And done a thousand little ac's o' kindness and respect--
2320,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,And me a-wishin' all the time that I could break his neck!
2321,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,My relief was like a mourner's when the funeral is done
2322,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,When they moved to Illinois in the Fall o' Forty-one.
2323,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2324,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,Then I went to work in airnest--I had nothin' much in view
2325,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"But to drown'd out rickollections--and it kep' me busy, too!"
2326,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"But I slowly thrived and prospered, tel Mother used to say"

2328,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2329,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"Then I'd think how little _money_ was, compared to happiness--"
2330,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,And who'd be left to use it when I died I couldn't guess!
2331,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"But I've still kep' speculatin' and a-gainin' year by year,"
2332,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"Tel I'm pay-in' half the taxes in the county, mighty near!"

2338,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2339,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"And then it closed by sayin' that I'd ""better come and see.""--"
2340,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"I'd never been West, anyhow--a most too wild fer _me_"
2341,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,I'd allus had a notion; but a lawyer here in town
2342,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,Said I'd find myself mistakened when I come to look around.
2343,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2344,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"So I bids good-bye to Mother, and I jumps aboard the train,"
2345,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,A-thinkin' what I'd bring her when I come back home again--
2346,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"And ef she'd had an idy what the present was to be,"

2355,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,The lawyer who was wantin' to swap the piece o' land--
2356,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,We started fer the country; and I ast the history
2357,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"Of the farm--its former owner--and so-forth, etcetery!"
2358,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2359,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"And--well--it was inte_rest_in'--I su-prised him, I suppose,"
2360,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,By the loud and frequent manner in which I blowed my nose!--
2361,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"But his su-prise was greater, and it made him wonder more,"
2362,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,When I kissed and hugged the widder when she met us at the door!--

2368,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,
2369,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"I _bought_ that farm, and _deeded_ it, afore I left the town,"
2370,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"With ""title clear to mansions in the skies,"" to Mary Brown!"
2371,FARMER WHIPPLE--BACHELOR,"And fu'thermore, I took her and _the childern_--fer, you see,"

2386,THE ROSE,THE ROSE
2387,THE ROSE,
2388,THE ROSE,
2389,THE ROSE,It tossed its head at the wooing breeze;
2390,THE ROSE,"And the sun, like a bashful swain,"
2391,THE ROSE,Beamed on it through the waving trees
2392,THE ROSE,"With a passion all in vain,--"
2393,THE ROSE,"For my rose laughed in a crimson glee,"
2394,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
2395,THE ROSE,
2396,THE ROSE,The honey-bee came there to sing
2397,THE ROSE,"His love through the languid hours,"
2398,THE ROSE,"And vaunt of his hives, as a proud old king"
2399,THE ROSE,Might boast of his palace-towers:
2400,THE ROSE,"But my rose bowed in a mockery,"
2401,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
2402,THE ROSE,
2403,THE ROSE,"The humming-bird, like a courtier gay,"
2404,THE ROSE,"Dipped down with a dalliant song,"
2405,THE ROSE,And twanged his wings through the roundelay
2406,THE ROSE,Of love the whole day long:
2407,THE ROSE,Yet my rose turned from his minstrelsy
2408,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
2409,THE ROSE,
2410,THE ROSE,The firefly came in the twilight dim
2411,THE ROSE,"My red, red rose to woo--"
2412,THE ROSE,Till quenched was the flame of love in him
2413,THE ROSE,"And the light of his lantern too,"
2414,THE ROSE,As my rose wept with dewdrops three
2415,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
2416,THE ROSE,
2417,THE ROSE,And I said: I will cull my own sweet rose--
2418,THE ROSE,Some day I will claim as mine
2419,THE ROSE,The priceless worth of the flower that knows
2420,THE ROSE,"No change, but a bloom divine--"
2421,THE ROSE,The bloom of a fadeless constancy
2422,THE ROSE,That hides in the leaves in wait for me!
2423,THE ROSE,
2424,THE ROSE,"But time passed by in a strange disguise,"
2425,THE ROSE,"And I marked it not, but lay"
2426,THE ROSE,"In a lazy dream, with drowsy eyes,"
2427,THE ROSE,"Till the summer slipped away,"
2428,THE ROSE,And a chill wind sang in a minor key:
2429,THE ROSE,"""Where is the rose that waits for thee?"""
2430,THE ROSE,
2431,THE ROSE,*       *       *       *       *
2432,THE ROSE,
2433,THE ROSE,"I dream to-day, o'er a purple stain"
2434,THE ROSE,"Of bloom on a withered stalk,"
2435,THE ROSE,Pelted down by the autumn rain
2436,THE ROSE,"In the dust of the garden-walk,"
2437,THE ROSE,That an Angel-rose in the world to be
2438,THE ROSE,Will hide in the leaves in wait for me.
2439,THE ROSE,
2440,THE ROSE,

2446,I,I
2447,I,
2448,I,Has she forgotten? On this very May
2449,I,"We were to meet here, with the birds and bees,"
2450,I,"As on that Sabbath, underneath the trees"
2451,I,"We strayed among the tombs, and stripped away"
2452,I,"The vines from these old granites, cold and gray--"
2453,I,And yet indeed not grim enough were they
2454,I,"To stay our kisses, smiles and ecstasies,"
2455,I,Or closer voice-lost vows and rhapsodies.
2456,I,Has she forgotten--that the May has won
2457,I,Its promise?--that the bird-songs from the tree
2458,I,Are sprayed above the grasses as the sun
2459,I,Might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly?
2460,I,Has she forgotten life--love--everyone--
2461,I,Has she forgotten me--forgotten me?

2465,II,

2467,II,"My lips and whisper to her. Does she hear,"
2468,II,"And yet hold silence, though I call her dear,"
2469,II,"Just as of old, save for the tearfulness"
2470,II,
2471,II,"Of the clenched eyes, and the soul's vast distress?"
2472,II,Has she forgotten thus the old caress
2473,II,That made our breath a quickened atmosphere
2474,II,That failed nigh unto swooning with the sheer
2475,II,Delight? Mine arms clutch now this earthen heap
2476,II,Sodden with tears that flow on ceaselessly
2477,II,"As autumn rains the long, long, long nights weep"
2478,II,"In memory of days that used to be,--"
2479,II,"Has she forgotten these? And in her sleep,"
2480,II,Has she forgotten me--forgotten me?

2483,III,III
2484,III,
2485,III,"To-night, against my pillow, with shut eyes,"
2486,III,I mean to weld our faces--through the dense
2487,III,Incalculable darkness make pretense
2488,III,That she has risen from her reveries
2489,III,To mate her dreams with mine in marriages
2490,III,"Of mellow palms, smooth faces, and tense ease"
2491,III,"Of every longing nerve of indolence,--"
2492,III,"Lift from the grave her quiet lips, and stun"
2493,III,My senses with her kisses--drawl the glee
2494,III,"Of her glad mouth, full blithe and tenderly,"
2495,III,"Across mine own, forgetful if is done"
2496,III,"The old love's awful dawn-time when said we,"
2497,III,"""To-day is ours!""... Ah, Heaven! can it be"
2498,III,She has forgotten me--forgotten me!

2540,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,
2541,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Wilful we are in our infirmity
2542,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Of childish questioning and discontent.
2543,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Whate'er befalls us is divinely meant--
2544,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Thou Truth the clearer for thy mystery!
2545,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Make us to meet what is or is to be
2546,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"With fervid welcome, knowing it is sent"
2547,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"To serve us in some way full excellent,"
2548,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Though we discern it all belatedly.

2551,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"Is in the lover's hand,--then on the breast"
2552,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"Of her he loves,--and there dies.--And who knows"
2553,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Which fate of all a rose may undergo
2554,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"Is fairest, dearest, sweetest, loveliest?"
2555,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,
2556,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"Nay, we are children: we will not mature."
2557,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,A blessed gift must seem a theft; and tears
2558,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Must storm our eyes when but a joy appears
2559,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,In drear disguise of sorrow; and how poor
2560,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"We seem when we are richest,--most secure"
2561,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Against all poverty the lifelong years
2562,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,We yet must waste in childish doubts and fears
2563,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"That, in despite of reason, still endure!"
2564,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Alas! the sermon of the rose we will
2565,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Not wisely ponder; nor the sobs of grief
2566,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Lulled into sighs of rapture; nor the cry
2567,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Of fierce defiance that again is still.
2568,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"Be patient--patient with our frail belief,"
2569,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,And stay it yet a little ere we die.
2570,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,
2571,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"O opulent life of ours, though dispossessed"

2574,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"Moaned over sleepless nights, kissed and caressed"
2575,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Through drip and blur of tears the tenderest.

2580,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,How sweet the sunlight on the garden wall
2581,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,Across the roses--and how sweetly flows
2582,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,The limpid yodel of the brook again!
2583,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,"And yet--and yet how sweeter after all,"
2584,THE SERMON OF THE ROSE,The smouldering sweetness of a dead red rose!
