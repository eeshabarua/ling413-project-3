46,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET
47,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Once more, O Mountains of the North, unveil"
48,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Your brows, and lay your cloudy mantles by"
49,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"And once more, ere the eyes that seek ye fail,"
50,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,Uplift against the blue walls of the sky
51,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Your mighty shapes, and let the sunshine weave"
52,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Its golden net-work in your belting woods,"
53,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Smile down in rainbows from your falling floods,"
54,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,And on your kingly brows at morn and eve
55,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,Set crowns of fire! So shall my soul receive
56,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Haply the secret of your calm and strength,"
57,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,Your unforgotten beauty interfuse
58,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"My common life, your glorious shapes and hues"
59,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"And sun-dropped splendors at my bidding come,"
60,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Loom vast through dreams, and stretch in billowy length"
61,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,From the sea-level of my lowland home!
62,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,
63,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,They rise before me! Last night's thunder-gust
64,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,Roared not in vain: for where its lightnings thrust
65,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Their tongues of fire, the great peaks seem so near,"
66,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Burned clean of mist, so starkly bold and clear,"
67,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"I almost pause the wind in the pines to hear,"
68,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"The loose rock's fall, the steps of browsing deer."
69,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,The clouds that shattered on yon slide-worn walls
70,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,And splintered on the rocks their spears of rain
71,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Have set in play a thousand waterfalls,"
72,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,Making the dusk and silence of the woods
73,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Glad with the laughter of the chasing floods,"
74,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"And luminous with blown spray and silver gleams,"
75,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"While, in the vales below, the dry-lipped streams"
76,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,Sing to the freshened meadow-lands again.
77,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"So, let me hope, the battle-storm that beats"
78,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,The land with hail and fire may pass away
79,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"With its spent thunders at the break of day,"
80,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"Like last night's clouds, and leave, as it retreats,"
81,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,"A greener earth and fairer sky behind,"
82,I. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET,Blown crystal-clear by Freedom's Northern wind!

84,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.
85,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"I would I were a painter, for the sake"
86,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Of a sweet picture, and of her who led,"
87,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"A fitting guide, with reverential tread,"
88,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,Into that mountain mystery. First a lake
89,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,Tinted with sunset; next the wavy lines
90,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Of far receding hills; and yet more far,"
91,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,Monadnock lifting from his night of pines
92,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,His rosy forehead to the evening star.
93,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Beside us, purple-zoned, Wachuset laid"
94,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"His head against the West, whose warm light made"
95,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"His aureole; and o'er him, sharp and clear,"
96,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Like a shaft of lightning in mid-launching stayed,"
97,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"A single level cloud-line, shone upon"
98,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"By the fierce glances of the sunken sun,"
99,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,Menaced the darkness with its golden spear!
100,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,
101,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,So twilight deepened round us. Still and black
102,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,The great woods climbed the mountain at our back;
103,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"And on their skirts, where yet the lingering day"
104,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"On the shorn greenness of the clearing lay,"
105,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,The brown old farm-house like a bird's-nest hung.
106,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,With home-life sounds the desert air was stirred
107,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"The bleat of sheep along the hill we heard,"
108,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"The bucket plashing in the cool, sweet well,"
109,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,The pasture-bars that clattered as they fell;
110,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Dogs barked, fowls fluttered, cattle lowed; the gate"
111,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,Of the barn-yard creaked beneath the merry weight
112,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Of sun-brown children, listening, while they swung,"
113,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,The welcome sound of supper-call to hear;
114,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"And down the shadowy lane, in tinklings clear,"
115,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,The pastoral curfew of the cow-bell rung.
116,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Thus soothed and pleased, our backward path we took,"
117,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Praising the farmer's home. He only spake,"
118,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Looking into the sunset o'er the lake,"
119,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,Like one to whom the far-off is most near:
120,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"""Yes, most folks think it has a pleasant look;"
121,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"I love it for my good old mother's sake,"
122,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Who lived and died here in the peace of God!"""
123,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"The lesson of his words we pondered o'er,"
124,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,As silently we turned the eastern flank
125,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Of the mountain, where its shadow deepest sank,"
126,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,Doubling the night along our rugged road:
127,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"We felt that man was more than his abode,--"
128,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,The inward life than Nature's raiment more;
129,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"And the warm sky, the sundown-tinted hill,"
130,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"The forest and the lake, seemed dwarfed and dim"
131,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Before the saintly soul, whose human will"
132,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,"Meekly in the Eternal footsteps trod,"
133,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,Making her homely toil and household ways
134,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,An earthly echo of the song of praise
135,II. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.,Swelling from angel lips and harps of seraphim.

140,THE VANISHERS.,THE VANISHERS.
141,THE VANISHERS.,
142,THE VANISHERS.,Sweetest of all childlike dreams
143,THE VANISHERS.,In the simple Indian lore
144,THE VANISHERS.,Still to me the legend seems
145,THE VANISHERS.,Of the shapes who flit before.
146,THE VANISHERS.,
147,THE VANISHERS.,"Flitting, passing, seen and gone,"
148,THE VANISHERS.,"Never reached nor found at rest,"
149,THE VANISHERS.,"Baffling search, but beckoning on"
150,THE VANISHERS.,To the Sunset of the Blest.
151,THE VANISHERS.,
152,THE VANISHERS.,"From the clefts of mountain rocks,"
153,THE VANISHERS.,"Through the dark of lowland firs,"
154,THE VANISHERS.,Flash the eyes and flow the locks
155,THE VANISHERS.,Of the mystic Vanishers!
156,THE VANISHERS.,
157,THE VANISHERS.,"And the fisher in his skiff,"
158,THE VANISHERS.,"And the hunter on the moss,"
159,THE VANISHERS.,"Hear their call from cape and cliff,"
160,THE VANISHERS.,See their hands the birch-leaves toss.
161,THE VANISHERS.,
162,THE VANISHERS.,"Wistful, longing, through the green"
163,THE VANISHERS.,"Twilight of the clustered pines,"
164,THE VANISHERS.,In their faces rarely seen
165,THE VANISHERS.,Beauty more than mortal shines.
166,THE VANISHERS.,
167,THE VANISHERS.,Fringed with gold their mantles flow
168,THE VANISHERS.,On the slopes of westering knolls;
169,THE VANISHERS.,In the wind they whisper low
170,THE VANISHERS.,Of the Sunset Land of Souls.
171,THE VANISHERS.,
172,THE VANISHERS.,"Doubt who may, O friend of mine!"
173,THE VANISHERS.,Thou and I have seen them too;
174,THE VANISHERS.,On before with beck and sign
175,THE VANISHERS.,"Still they glide, and we pursue."
176,THE VANISHERS.,
177,THE VANISHERS.,More than clouds of purple trail
178,THE VANISHERS.,In the gold of setting day;
179,THE VANISHERS.,More than gleams of wing or sail
180,THE VANISHERS.,Beckon from the sea-mist gray.
181,THE VANISHERS.,
182,THE VANISHERS.,"Glimpses of immortal youth,"
183,THE VANISHERS.,"Gleams and glories seen and flown,"
184,THE VANISHERS.,"Far-heard voices sweet with truth,"
185,THE VANISHERS.,Airs from viewless Eden blown;
186,THE VANISHERS.,
187,THE VANISHERS.,"Beauty that eludes our grasp,"
188,THE VANISHERS.,"Sweetness that transcends our taste,"
189,THE VANISHERS.,"Loving hands we may not clasp,"
190,THE VANISHERS.,Shining feet that mock our haste;
191,THE VANISHERS.,
192,THE VANISHERS.,"Gentle eyes we closed below,"
193,THE VANISHERS.,"Tender voices heard once more,"
194,THE VANISHERS.,"Smile and call us, as they go"
195,THE VANISHERS.,"On and onward, still before."
196,THE VANISHERS.,
197,THE VANISHERS.,"Guided thus, O friend of mine"
198,THE VANISHERS.,"Let us walk our little way,"
199,THE VANISHERS.,Knowing by each beckoning sign
200,THE VANISHERS.,That we are not quite astray.
201,THE VANISHERS.,
202,THE VANISHERS.,"Chase we still, with baffled feet,"
203,THE VANISHERS.,"Smiling eye and waving hand,"
204,THE VANISHERS.,"Sought and seeker soon shall meet,"
205,THE VANISHERS.,"Lost and found, in Sunset Land"
206,THE VANISHERS.,1864.

208,THE VANISHERS.,
209,THE VANISHERS.,
210,THE PAGEANT.,THE PAGEANT.
211,THE PAGEANT.,
212,THE PAGEANT.,"A sound as if from bells of silver,"
213,THE PAGEANT.,"Or elfin cymbals smitten clear,"
214,THE PAGEANT.,Through the frost-pictured panes I hear.
215,THE PAGEANT.,
216,THE PAGEANT.,"A brightness which outshines the morning,"
217,THE PAGEANT.,"A splendor brooking no delay,"
218,THE PAGEANT.,Beckons and tempts my feet away.
219,THE PAGEANT.,
220,THE PAGEANT.,I leave the trodden village highway
221,THE PAGEANT.,For virgin snow-paths glimmering through
222,THE PAGEANT.,A jewelled elm-tree avenue;
223,THE PAGEANT.,
224,THE PAGEANT.,"Where, keen against the walls of sapphire,"
225,THE PAGEANT.,"The gleaming tree-bolls, ice-embossed,"
226,THE PAGEANT.,Hold up their chandeliers of frost.
227,THE PAGEANT.,
228,THE PAGEANT.,"I tread in Orient halls enchanted,"
229,THE PAGEANT.,I dream the Saga's dream of caves
230,THE PAGEANT.,Gem-lit beneath the North Sea waves!
231,THE PAGEANT.,
232,THE PAGEANT.,"I walk the land of Eldorado,"
233,THE PAGEANT.,"I touch its mimic garden bowers,"
234,THE PAGEANT.,Its silver leaves and diamond flowers!
235,THE PAGEANT.,
236,THE PAGEANT.,The flora of the mystic mine-world
237,THE PAGEANT.,Around me lifts on crystal stems
238,THE PAGEANT.,The petals of its clustered gems!
239,THE PAGEANT.,
240,THE PAGEANT.,What miracle of weird transforming
241,THE PAGEANT.,"In this wild work of frost and light,"
242,THE PAGEANT.,This glimpse of glory infinite!
243,THE PAGEANT.,
244,THE PAGEANT.,This foregleam of the Holy City
245,THE PAGEANT.,"Like that to him of Patmos given,"
246,THE PAGEANT.,The white bride coming down from heaven!
247,THE PAGEANT.,
248,THE PAGEANT.,"How flash the ranked and mail-clad alders,"
249,THE PAGEANT.,Through what sharp-glancing spears of reeds
250,THE PAGEANT.,The brook its muffled water leads!
251,THE PAGEANT.,
252,THE PAGEANT.,"Yon maple, like the bush of Horeb,"
253,THE PAGEANT.,"Burns unconsumed: a white, cold fire"
254,THE PAGEANT.,Rays out from every grassy spire.
255,THE PAGEANT.,
256,THE PAGEANT.,"Each slender rush and spike of mullein,"
257,THE PAGEANT.,"Low laurel shrub and drooping fern,"
258,THE PAGEANT.,"Transfigured, blaze where'er I turn."
259,THE PAGEANT.,
260,THE PAGEANT.,How yonder Ethiopian hemlock
261,THE PAGEANT.,Crowned with his glistening circlet stands!
262,THE PAGEANT.,What jewels light his swarthy hands!
263,THE PAGEANT.,
264,THE PAGEANT.,"Here, where the forest opens southward,"
265,THE PAGEANT.,"Between its hospitable pines,"
266,THE PAGEANT.,"As through a door, the warm sun shines."
267,THE PAGEANT.,
268,THE PAGEANT.,"The jewels loosen on the branches,"
269,THE PAGEANT.,"And lightly, as the soft winds blow,"
270,THE PAGEANT.,"Fall, tinkling, on the ice below."
271,THE PAGEANT.,
272,THE PAGEANT.,And through the clashing of their cymbals
273,THE PAGEANT.,I hear the old familiar fall
274,THE PAGEANT.,"Of water down the rocky wall,"
275,THE PAGEANT.,
276,THE PAGEANT.,"Where, from its wintry prison breaking,"
277,THE PAGEANT.,"In dark and silence hidden long,"
278,THE PAGEANT.,The brook repeats its summer song.
279,THE PAGEANT.,
280,THE PAGEANT.,"One instant flashing in the sunshine,"
281,THE PAGEANT.,"Keen as a sabre from its sheath,"
282,THE PAGEANT.,Then lost again the ice beneath.
283,THE PAGEANT.,
284,THE PAGEANT.,"I hear the rabbit lightly leaping,"
285,THE PAGEANT.,"The foolish screaming of the jay,"
286,THE PAGEANT.,The chopper's axe-stroke far away;
287,THE PAGEANT.,
288,THE PAGEANT.,"The clamor of some neighboring barn-yard,"
289,THE PAGEANT.,"The lazy cock's belated crow,"
290,THE PAGEANT.,Or cattle-tramp in crispy snow.
291,THE PAGEANT.,
292,THE PAGEANT.,"And, as in some enchanted forest"
293,THE PAGEANT.,"The lost knight hears his comrades sing,"
294,THE PAGEANT.,"And, near at hand, their bridles ring,--"
295,THE PAGEANT.,
296,THE PAGEANT.,"So welcome I these sounds and voices,"
297,THE PAGEANT.,"These airs from far-off summer blown,"
298,THE PAGEANT.,This life that leaves me not alone.
299,THE PAGEANT.,
300,THE PAGEANT.,For the white glory overawes me;
301,THE PAGEANT.,The crystal terror of the seer
302,THE PAGEANT.,Of Chebar's vision blinds me here.
303,THE PAGEANT.,
304,THE PAGEANT.,"Rebuke me not, O sapphire heaven!"
305,THE PAGEANT.,"Thou stainless earth, lay not on me,"
306,THE PAGEANT.,"Thy keen reproach of purity,"
307,THE PAGEANT.,
308,THE PAGEANT.,"If, in this August presence-chamber,"
309,THE PAGEANT.,I sigh for summer's leaf-green gloom
310,THE PAGEANT.,And warm airs thick with odorous bloom!
311,THE PAGEANT.,
312,THE PAGEANT.,"Let the strange frost-work sink and crumble,"
313,THE PAGEANT.,"And let the loosened tree-boughs swing,"
314,THE PAGEANT.,Till all their bells of silver ring.
315,THE PAGEANT.,
316,THE PAGEANT.,"Shine warmly down, thou sun of noontime,"
317,THE PAGEANT.,"On this chill pageant, melt and move"
318,THE PAGEANT.,The winter's frozen heart with love.
319,THE PAGEANT.,
320,THE PAGEANT.,"And, soft and low, thou wind south-blowing,"
321,THE PAGEANT.,Breathe through a veil of tenderest haze
322,THE PAGEANT.,Thy prophecy of summer days.
323,THE PAGEANT.,
324,THE PAGEANT.,"Come with thy green relief of promise,"
325,THE PAGEANT.,"And to this dead, cold splendor bring"
326,THE PAGEANT.,The living jewels of the spring!
327,THE PAGEANT.,1869.

331,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.
332,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,
333,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"The time of gifts has come again,"
334,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"And, on my northern window-pane,"
335,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"Outlined against the day's brief light,"
336,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,A Christmas token hangs in sight.
337,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,
338,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"The wayside travellers, as they pass,"
339,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,Mark the gray disk of clouded glass;
340,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"And the dull blankness seems, perchance,"
341,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,Folly to their wise ignorance.
342,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,
343,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,They cannot from their outlook see
344,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,The perfect grace it hath for me;
345,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"For there the flower, whose fringes through"
346,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"The frosty breath of autumn blew,"
347,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,Turns from without its face of bloom
348,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"To the warm tropic of my room,"
349,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,As fair as when beside its brook
350,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,The hue of bending skies it took.
351,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,
352,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"So from the trodden ways of earth,"
353,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"Seem some sweet souls who veil their worth,"
354,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,And offer to the careless glance
355,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,The clouding gray of circumstance.
356,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"They blossom best where hearth-fires burn,"
357,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,To loving eyes alone they turn
358,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"The flowers of inward grace, that hide"
359,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,Their beauty from the world outside.
360,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,
361,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"But deeper meanings come to me,"
362,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"My half-immortal flower, from thee!"
363,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"Man judges from a partial view,"
364,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,None ever yet his brother knew;
365,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,The Eternal Eye that sees the whole
366,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"May better read the darkened soul,"
367,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,"And find, to outward sense denied,"
368,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,The flower upon its inmost side
369,THE PRESSED GENTIAN.,1872.

373,A MYSTERY.,A MYSTERY.
374,A MYSTERY.,
375,A MYSTERY.,The river hemmed with leaning trees
376,A MYSTERY.,Wound through its meadows green;
377,A MYSTERY.,"A low, blue line of mountains showed"
378,A MYSTERY.,The open pines between.
379,A MYSTERY.,
380,A MYSTERY.,"One sharp, tall peak above them all"
381,A MYSTERY.,Clear into sunlight sprang
382,A MYSTERY.,"I saw the river of my dreams,"
383,A MYSTERY.,The mountains that I sang!
384,A MYSTERY.,
385,A MYSTERY.,"No clue of memory led me on,"
386,A MYSTERY.,But well the ways I knew;
387,A MYSTERY.,A feeling of familiar things
388,A MYSTERY.,With every footstep grew.
389,A MYSTERY.,
390,A MYSTERY.,Not otherwise above its crag
391,A MYSTERY.,Could lean the blasted pine;
392,A MYSTERY.,Not otherwise the maple hold
393,A MYSTERY.,Aloft its red ensign.
394,A MYSTERY.,
395,A MYSTERY.,So up the long and shorn foot-hills
396,A MYSTERY.,The mountain road should creep;
397,A MYSTERY.,"So, green and low, the meadow fold"
398,A MYSTERY.,Its red-haired kine asleep.
399,A MYSTERY.,
400,A MYSTERY.,The river wound as it should wind;
401,A MYSTERY.,Their place the mountains took;
402,A MYSTERY.,The white torn fringes of their clouds
403,A MYSTERY.,Wore no unwonted look.
404,A MYSTERY.,
405,A MYSTERY.,Yet ne'er before that river's rim
406,A MYSTERY.,"Was pressed by feet of mine,"
407,A MYSTERY.,Never before mine eyes had crossed
408,A MYSTERY.,That broken mountain line.
409,A MYSTERY.,
410,A MYSTERY.,"A presence, strange at once and known,"
411,A MYSTERY.,Walked with me as my guide;
412,A MYSTERY.,The skirts of some forgotten life
413,A MYSTERY.,Trailed noiseless at my side.
414,A MYSTERY.,
415,A MYSTERY.,Was it a dim-remembered dream?
416,A MYSTERY.,Or glimpse through ions old?
417,A MYSTERY.,The secret which the mountains kept
418,A MYSTERY.,The river never told.
419,A MYSTERY.,
420,A MYSTERY.,But from the vision ere it passed
421,A MYSTERY.,"A tender hope I drew,"
422,A MYSTERY.,"And, pleasant as a dawn of spring,"
423,A MYSTERY.,"The thought within me grew,"
424,A MYSTERY.,
425,A MYSTERY.,"That love would temper every change,"
426,A MYSTERY.,"And soften all surprise,"
427,A MYSTERY.,"And, misty with the dreams of earth,"
428,A MYSTERY.,The hills of Heaven arise.

435,A SEA DREAM.,"We saw the slow tides go and come,"
436,A SEA DREAM.,"The curving surf-lines lightly drawn,"
437,A SEA DREAM.,The gray rocks touched with tender bloom
438,A SEA DREAM.,Beneath the fresh-blown rose of dawn.
439,A SEA DREAM.,
440,A SEA DREAM.,We saw in richer sunsets lost
441,A SEA DREAM.,The sombre pomp of showery noons;
442,A SEA DREAM.,And signalled spectral sails that crossed
443,A SEA DREAM.,"The weird, low light of rising moons."
444,A SEA DREAM.,
445,A SEA DREAM.,On stormy eves from cliff and head
446,A SEA DREAM.,We saw the white spray tossed and spurned;
447,A SEA DREAM.,"While over all, in gold and red,"
448,A SEA DREAM.,Its face of fire the lighthouse turned.
449,A SEA DREAM.,
450,A SEA DREAM.,"The rail-car brought its daily crowds,"
451,A SEA DREAM.,"Half curious, half indifferent,"
452,A SEA DREAM.,"Like passing sails or floating clouds,"
453,A SEA DREAM.,We saw them as they came and went.
454,A SEA DREAM.,
455,A SEA DREAM.,"But, one calm morning, as we lay"
456,A SEA DREAM.,And watched the mirage-lifted wall
457,A SEA DREAM.,"Of coast, across the dreamy bay,"
458,A SEA DREAM.,"And heard afar the curlew call,"
459,A SEA DREAM.,
460,A SEA DREAM.,"And nearer voices, wild or tame,"
461,A SEA DREAM.,"Of airy flock and childish throng,"
462,A SEA DREAM.,Up from the water's edge there came
463,A SEA DREAM.,Faint snatches of familiar song.
464,A SEA DREAM.,
465,A SEA DREAM.,Careless we heard the singer's choice
466,A SEA DREAM.,Of old and common airs; at last
467,A SEA DREAM.,The tender pathos of his voice
468,A SEA DREAM.,In one low chanson held us fast.
469,A SEA DREAM.,
470,A SEA DREAM.,"A song that mingled joy and pain,"
471,A SEA DREAM.,And memories old and sadly sweet;
472,A SEA DREAM.,"While, timing to its minor strain,"
473,A SEA DREAM.,The waves in lapsing cadence beat.
474,A SEA DREAM.,
475,A SEA DREAM.,.     .     .     .     .
476,A SEA DREAM.,
477,A SEA DREAM.,The waves are glad in breeze and sun;
478,A SEA DREAM.,The rocks are fringed with foam;
479,A SEA DREAM.,"I walk once more a haunted shore,"
480,A SEA DREAM.,"A stranger, yet at home,"
481,A SEA DREAM.,A land of dreams I roam.
482,A SEA DREAM.,
483,A SEA DREAM.,"Is this the wind, the soft sea wind"
484,A SEA DREAM.,That stirred thy locks of brown?
485,A SEA DREAM.,Are these the rocks whose mosses knew
486,A SEA DREAM.,"The trail of thy light gown,"
487,A SEA DREAM.,Where boy and girl sat down?
488,A SEA DREAM.,
489,A SEA DREAM.,"I see the gray fort's broken wall,"
490,A SEA DREAM.,The boats that rock below;
491,A SEA DREAM.,"And, out at sea, the passing sails"
492,A SEA DREAM.,We saw so long ago
493,A SEA DREAM.,Rose-red in morning's glow.
494,A SEA DREAM.,
495,A SEA DREAM.,The freshness of the early time
496,A SEA DREAM.,On every breeze is blown;
497,A SEA DREAM.,"As glad the sea, as blue the sky,--"
498,A SEA DREAM.,The change is ours alone;
499,A SEA DREAM.,The saddest is my own.
500,A SEA DREAM.,
501,A SEA DREAM.,"A stranger now, a world-worn man,"
502,A SEA DREAM.,Is he who bears my name;
503,A SEA DREAM.,"But thou, methinks, whose mortal life"
504,A SEA DREAM.,"Immortal youth became,"
505,A SEA DREAM.,Art evermore the same.
506,A SEA DREAM.,
507,A SEA DREAM.,"Thou art not here, thou art not there,"
508,A SEA DREAM.,Thy place I cannot see;
509,A SEA DREAM.,I only know that where thou art
510,A SEA DREAM.,"The blessed angels be,"
511,A SEA DREAM.,And heaven is glad for thee.
512,A SEA DREAM.,
513,A SEA DREAM.,Forgive me if the evil years
514,A SEA DREAM.,Have left on me their sign;
515,A SEA DREAM.,"Wash out, O soul so beautiful,"
516,A SEA DREAM.,The many stains of mine
517,A SEA DREAM.,In tears of love divine!
518,A SEA DREAM.,
519,A SEA DREAM.,"I could not look on thee and live,"
520,A SEA DREAM.,If thou wert by my side;
521,A SEA DREAM.,"The vision of a shining one,"
522,A SEA DREAM.,"The white and heavenly bride,"
523,A SEA DREAM.,Is well to me denied.
524,A SEA DREAM.,
525,A SEA DREAM.,But turn to me thy dear girl-face
526,A SEA DREAM.,"Without the angel's crown,"
527,A SEA DREAM.,"The wedded roses of thy lips,"
528,A SEA DREAM.,Thy loose hair rippling down
529,A SEA DREAM.,In waves of golden brown.
530,A SEA DREAM.,
531,A SEA DREAM.,"Look forth once more through space and time,"
532,A SEA DREAM.,And let thy sweet shade fall
533,A SEA DREAM.,In tenderest grace of soul and form
534,A SEA DREAM.,"On memory's frescoed wall,"
535,A SEA DREAM.,"A shadow, and yet all!"
536,A SEA DREAM.,
537,A SEA DREAM.,"Draw near, more near, forever dear!"
538,A SEA DREAM.,"Where'er I rest or roam,"
539,A SEA DREAM.,"Or in the city's crowded streets,"
540,A SEA DREAM.,"Or by the blown sea foam,"
541,A SEA DREAM.,The thought of thee is home!
542,A SEA DREAM.,
543,A SEA DREAM.,.     .     .    .    .
544,A SEA DREAM.,
545,A SEA DREAM.,At breakfast hour the singer read
546,A SEA DREAM.,"The city news, with comment wise,"
547,A SEA DREAM.,Like one who felt the pulse of trade
548,A SEA DREAM.,Beneath his finger fall and rise.
549,A SEA DREAM.,
550,A SEA DREAM.,"His look, his air, his curt speech, told"
551,A SEA DREAM.,"The man of action, not of books,"
552,A SEA DREAM.,To whom the corners made in gold
553,A SEA DREAM.,And stocks were more than seaside nooks.
554,A SEA DREAM.,
555,A SEA DREAM.,Of life beneath the life confessed
556,A SEA DREAM.,His song had hinted unawares;
557,A SEA DREAM.,"Of flowers in traffic's ledgers pressed,"
558,A SEA DREAM.,Of human hearts in bulls and bears.
559,A SEA DREAM.,
560,A SEA DREAM.,But eyes in vain were turned to watch
561,A SEA DREAM.,That face so hard and shrewd and strong;
562,A SEA DREAM.,And ears in vain grew sharp to catch
563,A SEA DREAM.,The meaning of that morning song.
564,A SEA DREAM.,
565,A SEA DREAM.,In vain some sweet-voiced querist sought
566,A SEA DREAM.,"To sound him, leaving as she came;"
567,A SEA DREAM.,Her baited album only caught
568,A SEA DREAM.,"A common, unromantic name."
569,A SEA DREAM.,
570,A SEA DREAM.,"No word betrayed the mystery fine,"
571,A SEA DREAM.,That trembled on the singer's tongue;
572,A SEA DREAM.,"He came and went, and left no sign"
573,A SEA DREAM.,Behind him save the song he sung.

1251,THE WOOD GIANT,"Beyond, in misty distance dim,"
1252,THE WOOD GIANT,The rugged Northern Highlands.
1253,THE WOOD GIANT,
1254,THE WOOD GIANT,Dark Titan on his Sunset Hill
1255,THE WOOD GIANT,Of time and change defiant
1256,THE WOOD GIANT,"How dwarfed the common woodland seemed,"
1257,THE WOOD GIANT,Before the old-time giant!
1258,THE WOOD GIANT,
1259,THE WOOD GIANT,"What marvel that, in simpler days"
1260,THE WOOD GIANT,"Of the world's early childhood,"
1261,THE WOOD GIANT,"Men crowned with garlands, gifts, and praise"
1262,THE WOOD GIANT,Such monarchs of the wild-wood?
1263,THE WOOD GIANT,
1264,THE WOOD GIANT,That Tyrian maids with flower and song
1265,THE WOOD GIANT,"Danced through the hill grove's spaces,"
1266,THE WOOD GIANT,And hoary-bearded Druids found
1267,THE WOOD GIANT,In woods their holy places?
1268,THE WOOD GIANT,
1269,THE WOOD GIANT,With somewhat of that Pagan awe
1270,THE WOOD GIANT,"With Christian reverence blending,"
1271,THE WOOD GIANT,We saw our pine-tree's mighty arms
1272,THE WOOD GIANT,Above our heads extending.
1273,THE WOOD GIANT,
1274,THE WOOD GIANT,"We heard his needles' mystic rune,"
1275,THE WOOD GIANT,"Now rising, and now dying,"
1276,THE WOOD GIANT,As erst Dodona's priestess heard
1277,THE WOOD GIANT,The oak leaves prophesying.
1278,THE WOOD GIANT,
1279,THE WOOD GIANT,Was it the half-unconscious moan
1280,THE WOOD GIANT,"Of one apart and mateless,"
1281,THE WOOD GIANT,"The weariness of unshared power,"
1282,THE WOOD GIANT,The loneliness of greatness?
1283,THE WOOD GIANT,
1284,THE WOOD GIANT,"O dawns and sunsets, lend to him"
1285,THE WOOD GIANT,Your beauty and your wonder!
1286,THE WOOD GIANT,"Blithe sparrow, sing thy summer song"
1287,THE WOOD GIANT,His solemn shadow under!
1288,THE WOOD GIANT,
1289,THE WOOD GIANT,"Play lightly on his slender keys,"
1290,THE WOOD GIANT,"O wind of summer, waking"
1291,THE WOOD GIANT,For hills like these the sound of seas
1292,THE WOOD GIANT,"On far-off beaches breaking,"
1293,THE WOOD GIANT,
1294,THE WOOD GIANT,And let the eagle and the crow
1295,THE WOOD GIANT,"Find shelter in his branches,"
1296,THE WOOD GIANT,When winds shake down his winter snow
1297,THE WOOD GIANT,In silver avalanches.
1298,THE WOOD GIANT,
1299,THE WOOD GIANT,"The brave are braver for their cheer,"
1300,THE WOOD GIANT,"The strongest need assurance,"
1301,THE WOOD GIANT,The sigh of longing makes not less
1302,THE WOOD GIANT,The lesson of endurance.

1308,A DAY.,"Talk not of sad November, when a day"
1309,A DAY.,"Of warm, glad sunshine fills the sky of noon,"
1310,A DAY.,"And a wind, borrowed from some morn of June,"
1311,A DAY.,Stirs the brown grasses and the leafless spray.
1312,A DAY.,
1313,A DAY.,On the unfrosted pool the pillared pines
1314,A DAY.,"Lay their long shafts of shadow: the small rill,"
1315,A DAY.,"Singing a pleasant song of summer still,"
1316,A DAY.,"A line of silver, down the hill-slope shines."
1317,A DAY.,
1318,A DAY.,"Hushed the bird-voices and the hum of bees,"
1319,A DAY.,In the thin grass the crickets pipe no more;
1320,A DAY.,"But still the squirrel hoards his winter store,"
1321,A DAY.,And drops his nut-shells from the shag-bark trees.
1322,A DAY.,
1323,A DAY.,Softly the dark green hemlocks whisper: high
1324,A DAY.,"Above, the spires of yellowing larches show,"
1325,A DAY.,Where the woodpecker and home-loving crow
1326,A DAY.,And jay and nut-hatch winter's threat defy.
1327,A DAY.,
1328,A DAY.,"O gracious beauty, ever new and old!"
1329,A DAY.,"O sights and sounds of nature, doubly dear"
1330,A DAY.,When the low sunshine warns the closing year
1331,A DAY.,Of snow-blown fields and waves of Arctic cold!
1332,A DAY.,
1333,A DAY.,Close to my heart I fold each lovely thing
1334,A DAY.,"The sweet day yields; and, not disconsolate,"
1335,A DAY.,With the calm patience of the woods I wait
1336,A DAY.,For leaf and blossom when God gives us Spring!
