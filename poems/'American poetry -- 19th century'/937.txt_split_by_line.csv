17,,"In preparing this electronic text of Father Ryan's poems,"
18,,I was struck by the biased nature of the memoir included.
19,,"While I will not gainsay anyone's right to their beliefs,"
20,,I believe it is clearly evident from the poems themselves
21,,"that Father Ryan believed strongly in the Southern Cause,"
22,,"and I do not believe his reaction was entirely emotional,"
23,,as seems to be implied.  The Memoir also makes mention of
24,,"Father Ryan's poem ""Reunited"", as evidence of his support"
25,,"for the reunification of the States.  To be fair to Ryan,"
26,,I would note that such stanzas as
27,,
28,,"""The Northern heart and the Southern heart"
29,,May beat in peace again;
30,,
31,,"""But still till time's last day,"
32,,"Whatever lips may plight,"
33,,"The blue is blue, but the gray is gray,"
34,,"Wrong never accords with Right."""
35,,
36,,"in `Sentinel Songs', are much more common in his poems."
37,,
38,,"I believe it important to notice this, as it demonstrates"
39,,"that while Ryan loved Peace, he never forsook the Cause."
40,,
41,,"Regarding his possible dates of birth, I can do no better"
42,,"than the Memoir included, but I can at least match places"
43,,"with dates, to wit:  Hagerstown, Md., on 5 February 1838;"
44,,"or Norfolk, Virginia, sometime in 1838 or 15 August 1839."
45,,"His full name was Abram Joseph Ryan, and he was the son"
46,,of Matthew and Mary (Coughlin) Ryan.  He was ordained in 1856
47,,"and he taught at Niagara, N.Y. and Cape Girardeau, Missouri,"
48,,before he became a chaplain in the Confederate Army in 1862.
49,,"He edited several publications, including the ""Pacificator"","
50,,"the Catholic weekly ""The Star"" (New Orleans),"
51,,"and ""The Banner of the South"" in Augusta, Georgia."
52,,"He was the pastor of St. Mary's Church in Mobile, Alabama"
53,,from 1870 to 1883.  He died at a Franciscan Monastery
54,,"at Louisville, Kentucky, on 22 April 1886.  He is buried in Mobile."
55,,
56,,"His most famous poem is ""The Conquered Banner"","
57,,which had its measure inspired by a Gregorian hymn.

125,AUTHOR,"These verses (which some friends call by the higher title of Poems,"
126,AUTHOR,to which appellation the author objects) were written at random --
127,AUTHOR,"off and on, here, there, anywhere -- just when the mood came,"
128,AUTHOR,"with little of study and less of art, and always in a hurry."
129,AUTHOR,
130,AUTHOR,"Hence they are incomplete in finish, as the author is;"

132,AUTHOR,that lead up to the Altar and its Mysteries than of the steeps
133,AUTHOR,that lead up to Parnassus and the Home of the Muses.
134,AUTHOR,"And souls were always more to him than songs.  But still,"
135,AUTHOR,somehow -- and he could not tell why -- he sometimes tried to sing.
136,AUTHOR,Here are his simple songs.  He never dreamed of taking even lowest place
137,AUTHOR,"in the rank of authors.  But friends persisted; and, finally,"
138,AUTHOR,"a young lawyer friend, who has entire charge of his business in the book,"
139,AUTHOR,forced him to front the world and its critics.  There are verses
140,AUTHOR,"connected with the war published in this volume, not for harm-sake,"
141,AUTHOR,"nor for hate-sake, but simply because the author wrote them."
142,AUTHOR,"He could write again in the same tone and key, under the same circumstances."

300,C.S.A.,
301,C.S.A.,
302,C.S.A.,
303,C.S.A.,It is regretted that the materials at hand at this writing
304,C.S.A.,are not sufficient to warrant as extended a notice as the publishers
305,C.S.A.,"of the present enlarged volume of Father Ryan's poems would wish,"
306,C.S.A.,and as the many friends and admirers of the dead priest and poet desire.
307,C.S.A.,So distinguished a character and so brilliant a man
308,C.S.A.,"cannot be passed over lightly, or dealt with sparingly,"
309,C.S.A.,if the demand of his friends and the public generally would be satisfied
310,C.S.A.,even in a moderate degree; for Father Ryan's fame is the inheritance
311,C.S.A.,"of a great and enlightened nation, and his writings have passed into history"
312,C.S.A.,to emblazon its pages and enrich the literature of the present
313,C.S.A.,"and succeeding ages, since it is confidently believed that,"
314,C.S.A.,"with the lapse of time, his fame and his merits will grow brighter"
315,C.S.A.,"and more enduring.  With this appreciation of his merits,"
316,C.S.A.,"and a realizing sense of what is due to his memory,"
317,C.S.A.,and with an equal consciousness of his own want of ability
318,C.S.A.,"to do justice to the subject, the writer bespeaks the indulgent criticism"
319,C.S.A.,of those who may read the following remarks -- admittedly far short
320,C.S.A.,of what are due to the illustrious dead.
321,C.S.A.,
322,C.S.A.,The exact date and place of Father Ryan's birth are not yet
323,C.S.A.,"definitely settled.  Some assert that he was born at Norfolk, Va.;"
324,C.S.A.,"others claim Hagerstown, Md., as the place of his birth;"
325,C.S.A.,"whilst there is some ground to believe that in Limerick, Ireland,"
326,C.S.A.,he first saw the light.  The same uncertainty exists as to time.
327,C.S.A.,"Some claim to know that he was born in 1834, whilst others fix"
328,C.S.A.,"with equal certainty, the year 1836 as the time.  In the midst of these"
329,C.S.A.,"conflicting statements, the writer prefers to leave the questions at issue"
330,C.S.A.,"for future determination, when it is hoped that final and conclusive proof"
331,C.S.A.,will be obtained to place them outside the realms of dispute.
332,C.S.A.,"Meanwhile, he will present what may be regarded as of primary importance"
333,C.S.A.,"in forming a correct estimate of the character of the deceased,"
334,C.S.A.,"and the value of his life-work, which, after all, are the chief ends"
335,C.S.A.,sought to be accomplished.
336,C.S.A.,
337,C.S.A.,"From the most reliable information that can be obtained,"
338,C.S.A.,it is learned that Father Ryan went to St. Louis with his parents
339,C.S.A.,when a lad of some seven or eight years.  There he received his early training
340,C.S.A.,under the Brothers of the Christian Schools.  Even at that early date
341,C.S.A.,young Ryan showed signs of mental activity which gave promise
342,C.S.A.,of one day producing substantial and lasting results.
343,C.S.A.,"He evinced rare aptitude for knowledge, and made rapid progress"
344,C.S.A.,in its attainment.  His thoughtful mien and modest look soon won for him
345,C.S.A.,the respect and friendship of his teachers and the esteem and affection
346,C.S.A.,of his companions.  It was noticed that he had an instinctive reverence
347,C.S.A.,"for sacred things and places, and a rich and ardent nature which bespoke"
348,C.S.A.,deep spirituality.  Discerning eyes soon recognized in the mild youth
349,C.S.A.,"the germs of a future vocation to the priesthood.  It was, therefore,"
350,C.S.A.,prudently resolved to throw around him every possible safeguard
351,C.S.A.,in order to protect and cherish so rare and precious a gift.
352,C.S.A.,"The youth himself corresponded to this design, and bent all his energies"
353,C.S.A.,towards acquiring the necessary education to fit him
354,C.S.A.,for entering upon the still higher and more extended studies required
355,C.S.A.,for the exalted vocation to which he aspired.  In due time he had made
356,C.S.A.,"the necessary preparatory studies, and was deemed fitted to enter"
357,C.S.A.,"the ecclesiastical seminary at Niagara, N.Y., whither he went,"
358,C.S.A.,"having bid an affectionate farewell to his relatives and numerous friends,"
359,C.S.A.,"who fervently invoked heaven's blessing upon the pious youth who, they hoped,"
360,C.S.A.,"would return one day to their midst to offer up the ""Clean Oblation"""
361,C.S.A.,"which is offered up ""from the rising of the sun until the going down thereof."""
362,C.S.A.,
363,C.S.A.,The heart of the youth as he started for his future home was all aglow
364,C.S.A.,with the fervor that animated him in the pursuit of his high and holy purpose.
365,C.S.A.,"He entered the seminary, leaving no regrets or attachments behind him."
366,C.S.A.,One thing only did he appear to regret -- separation from home
367,C.S.A.,and the loved ones to whom he had bid so affectionate an adieu.
368,C.S.A.,Home and parents are ever dear to the pure of heart; for around them cluster
369,C.S.A.,memories too precious and associations too endearing for utterance.
370,C.S.A.,"Father -- mother -- home, ""trinity of joys"", whose completion and perfection"
371,C.S.A.,are to be found only in the Trinity in Heaven -- these must ever remain
372,C.S.A.,bright recollections in the lives of all who cherish ennobling sentiments
373,C.S.A.,which do reverence to God and honor to humanity.  But if such be
374,C.S.A.,"the effect of these sentiments upon the hearts of men in general,"
375,C.S.A.,"they have a still deeper and more tender effect upon those who,"
376,C.S.A.,"in response to the call of the Master, ""Follow thou Me,"""
377,C.S.A.,"have abandoned all things for His sweet sake, that they may find"
378,C.S.A.,"a home hereafter in heaven, after having spent themselves"
379,C.S.A.,in dispensing His riches and benefits to men.
380,C.S.A.,
381,C.S.A.,"Like nearly all great men, Father Ryan owed much to"
382,C.S.A.,the early training and example of his truly Christian mother.
383,C.S.A.,Hence the deep affection he ever manifested towards her.
384,C.S.A.,"After the lapse of long years, we find his heart still fresh and loving,"
385,C.S.A.,pouring out upon the grave of his mother all the wealth of his rich mind
386,C.S.A.,and the affection of his chaste heart.  He tells us that
387,C.S.A.,he had placed his poems upon her grave as a garland of affection.
388,C.S.A.,Oh! what a beautiful offering on the part of a gifted son to a devoted mother!
389,C.S.A.,Nature's richest and best gifts consecrated to nature's purest
390,C.S.A.,and holiest sentiments!  May we not suppose that the endearing affection
391,C.S.A.,which he cherished for his mother was the source of the inspiration
392,C.S.A.,"which drew forth the ""splendid brightness of his songs""?"
393,C.S.A.,"This filial reverence and tender affection, could nothing more"
394,C.S.A.,"be said in his favor, would speak volumes in his praise."
395,C.S.A.,"But how much more can be said, and said truly, were there pen and lips"
396,C.S.A.,eloquent enough to proclaim his praises!  Mine are unworthy of the task;
397,C.S.A.,"yet mine be the duty of recalling some, at least, of the virtues and qualities"
398,C.S.A.,"that marked him during life; for virtues and estimable qualities he had,"
399,C.S.A.,"and they were many and conspicuous.  Heaven doth know,"
400,C.S.A.,"earth doth witness, angels have recorded, that he is worthy of praise."
401,C.S.A.,"Therefore, in no cold and measured terms shall the writer speak"
402,C.S.A.,"of the dear and venerated dead, Abram J. Ryan, priest and poet --"
403,C.S.A.,"once magic name, still revered and possessed of talismanic power."
404,C.S.A.,"If we cannot crown thee, O child of genius, with a wreath of justice,"
405,C.S.A.,"let us, at least, endeavor to crown thee with a garland of love,"
406,C.S.A.,composed of thy own glorious deeds and achievements.
407,C.S.A.,
408,C.S.A.,Having passed through the usual course of studies in an ecclesiastical
409,C.S.A.,"seminary with distinction, Father Ryan was duly ordained priest,"
410,C.S.A.,and soon afterwards entered upon the active duties of missionary life.
411,C.S.A.,"But little was heard of him until the breaking out of the late civil war,"
412,C.S.A.,"when he entered the Confederate army as a chaplain,"
413,C.S.A.,and served in that capacity up to the close of the civil war.
414,C.S.A.,"He was then stationed at Nashville, afterwards at Clarksville, Tenn.,"
415,C.S.A.,"and still later at Augusta, Ga., where he founded the ~Banner of the South~,"
416,C.S.A.,"which exercised great influence over the people of that section,"
417,C.S.A.,"and continued about five years, when Father Ryan was obliged"
418,C.S.A.,"to suspend its publication.  He then removed to Mobile, Ala.,"
419,C.S.A.,"where he was appointed pastor of St. Mary's Church in 1870,"
420,C.S.A.,"and continued in that position until 1883, when he obtained leave of absence"
421,C.S.A.,from Bishop Quinlan to make an extended lecture tour of the country to further
422,C.S.A.,a praiseworthy and charitable undertaking of great interest to the South.
423,C.S.A.,"Bishop Quinlan having died soon afterwards, Father Ryan's leave was extended"
424,C.S.A.,"by his successor, Bishop Manucy.  It was whilst engaged in this mission"
425,C.S.A.,that Father Ryan received his death summons.
426,C.S.A.,
427,C.S.A.,"During all these changes and journeyings, the busy brain of Father Ryan"
428,C.S.A.,"was incessantly employed, expending itself in composing"
429,C.S.A.,those immortal poems which have won their way to all hearts
430,C.S.A.,and elicited widespread and unmeasured praise from critics
431,C.S.A.,"of the highest repute.  Like all true poets, Father Ryan touched"
432,C.S.A.,"the tenderest chords of the human heart, and made them respond"
433,C.S.A.,to his own lofty feelings and sublime inspirations.
434,C.S.A.,
435,C.S.A.,Of his priestly character but little need be said.  His superiors
436,C.S.A.,and those whom he served know best how well and faithfully
437,C.S.A.,he discharged the sometimes severe and always onerous and responsible duties
438,C.S.A.,of his sacred calling.  The merit of his life-work is now
439,C.S.A.,"the measure of his reward.  As he had in view only God's honor and glory,"
440,C.S.A.,"and the good of his fellow-men, and directed his labors"
441,C.S.A.,"and employed his talents to promote these ends, may we not hope"
442,C.S.A.,"that a merciful Judge has given him a recompense in excess of his deserts,"
443,C.S.A.,"since, in the bountifulness of His liberality, He is wont to bestow a reward"
444,C.S.A.,exceeding our merits?
445,C.S.A.,
446,C.S.A.,But it is not claimed that Father Ryan was without fault.
447,C.S.A.,"This would be attributing to him angelic nature or equivalent perfection,"
448,C.S.A.,"against which, were he living, he would be the first to protest."
449,C.S.A.,"He needs no such fulsome or exaggerated praise.  He was a man,"
450,C.S.A.,"though not cast in the common mould, and as such let us view him."
451,C.S.A.,"Doubtless he had his faults, and perhaps not a few;"
452,C.S.A.,"for ""the best of men are only the least sinful.""  But as far as is known,"
453,C.S.A.,he had no serious defects or blemishes that would mar the beauty
454,C.S.A.,or disturb the harmonious grandeur of his character in its entirety.
455,C.S.A.,"Had his heart been cold and selfish, or his thoughts defiled"
456,C.S.A.,"with the sordid cares of earth, he never could have sung so sweetly"
457,C.S.A.,or soared so sublimely into those serene and heavenly regions
458,C.S.A.,whither his chaste fancy led him.  He delighted to roam
459,C.S.A.,"in those far-off regions beyond the skies, whose spheres are ruled"
460,C.S.A.,and whose realms are governed by those mysterious laws
461,C.S.A.,"which have their fountain source in God, and whose operations"
462,C.S.A.,are controlled by the exercise of His infinite power and love.
463,C.S.A.,"His defects, then, did not seriously impair the integrity of his virtues,"
464,C.S.A.,which were many and solid.  Chief amongst his virtues may be named
465,C.S.A.,"his zeal for the honor and glory of God, and devotion to the Mother of God --"
466,C.S.A.,the latter the necessary outgrowth of the former.  The deep and earnest piety
467,C.S.A.,"of Father Ryan towards his ""Queen and Patroness"", as he loved to call her,"
468,C.S.A.,"bespeaks much in his praise; for, like all truly great men"
469,C.S.A.,"of the Catholic Church, he saw that it was not only eminently proper,"
470,C.S.A.,"but also a sublime act of Christian duty, to pay filial reverence and honor"
471,C.S.A.,to the Mother of God.  Hence Father Ryan crowned Mary with many gems
472,C.S.A.,"of rare beauty.  Amongst them may be named his beautiful poem ""Last of May"","
473,C.S.A.,"dedicated to the Children of Mary, of the Cathedral of Mobile, Ala."
474,C.S.A.,Few Catholics will read these lines without experiencing feelings
475,C.S.A.,of deep and tender devotion towards their Queen and Mother.
476,C.S.A.,
477,C.S.A.,"Father Ryan's was an open, manly character, in which there was"
478,C.S.A.,no dissimulation.  His generous nature and warm heart were ever moved
479,C.S.A.,"by kind impulses and influenced by charitable feelings,"
480,C.S.A.,as became his priestly calling.  We may readily believe him when he tells us
481,C.S.A.,that he never wrote a line for hate's sake.  He shrank instinctively
482,C.S.A.,from all that was mean and sordid.  Generosity was a marked trait
483,C.S.A.,"of his character, an ennobling principle of his nature,"
484,C.S.A.,"the motive power of his actions, and the mainspring of his life."
485,C.S.A.,"Friendship was likewise congenial to his taste, if not a necessity"
486,C.S.A.,of his nature; and with him it meant more than a name.
487,C.S.A.,It was a sacred union formed between kindred spirits --
488,C.S.A.,a chain of affection whose binding link was fidelity.
489,C.S.A.,"Never was he false to its claims, nor known to have violated its obligations."
490,C.S.A.,Hence he was highly esteemed during life by numerous persons
491,C.S.A.,of all classes and denominations; for his sympathies
492,C.S.A.,"were as broad as humanity, and as far-reaching as its wants and its miseries."
493,C.S.A.,"Yet he was a man of deep conviction and a strict adherent to principle,"
494,C.S.A.,or what he conceived to be principle; for we find him long after the war
495,C.S.A.,"still clinging to its memories, and slow to accept its results,"
496,C.S.A.,which he believed were fraught with disaster to the people of his section.
497,C.S.A.,"A Southerner of the most pronounced kind, he was unwilling"
498,C.S.A.,to make any concession to his victorious opponents of the North
499,C.S.A.,"which could be withheld from them.  Perhaps, upon reflection,"
500,C.S.A.,it may not appear wholly strange or inexplicable that he should have so acted.
501,C.S.A.,"There was, at least, some foundation for his fears with regard to"
502,C.S.A.,"the ill fate of those of his section.  Though peace had been proclaimed,"
503,C.S.A.,the rainbow of hope did not encircle the heavens or cast its peaceful shadow
504,C.S.A.,"over the South.  Dark clouds loomed up over that fair and sunny land,"
505,C.S.A.,portentous of evil; for they were surcharged with the lightning of passion.
506,C.S.A.,The chariot wheel of the conqueror had laid waste and desolate the land.
507,C.S.A.,No one knew precisely what would follow; for passion's dark spirit
508,C.S.A.,was abroad and ruling in high places.  To make matters worse
509,C.S.A.,"and intensify the sufferings of the people still more, they were debarred"
510,C.S.A.,from participating in the political affairs of their own States.
511,C.S.A.,"Non-residents, and aliens in sympathy and common interest,"
512,C.S.A.,"were appointed to rule over them, if not to oppress them."
513,C.S.A.,Is it to be wondered at if some refused to bow and kiss the hands
514,C.S.A.,that were uplifted against them?  Among such was Father Ryan.
515,C.S.A.,All honor to the man and those who stood by him!  Instead of attempting
516,C.S.A.,"to cast obloquy upon their memory, we should do them honor"
517,C.S.A.,for having maintained in its integrity the dignity of the manhood
518,C.S.A.,"with which heaven had blessed them, when earth had deprived them"
519,C.S.A.,of all else that was dear and sacred to brave and honorable men!
520,C.S.A.,But how differently Father Ryan acted when the oppressed people of the South
521,C.S.A.,"were restored to their rights, and when the great heart of the North"
522,C.S.A.,went out in sympathy towards them in their dire affliction
523,C.S.A.,"during the awful visitation of the yellow fever, when death reaped"
524,C.S.A.,"a rich harvest in Memphis and elsewhere, and a sorrow-stricken land"
525,C.S.A.,"was once more buried in ruin and desolation!  It was then, indeed,"
526,C.S.A.,that Father Ryan and all good men beheld the grand spectacle
527,C.S.A.,of the whole North coming to the rescue of the afflicted South
528,C.S.A.,with intense and sublime admiration.  He then saw for certain
529,C.S.A.,the rainbow of peace span the heavens; and though his section
530,C.S.A.,"was wailing under the hand of affliction, he yet took down his harp,"
531,C.S.A.,"which for years had hung on the weeping willows of his much-loved South,"
532,C.S.A.,"and, with renewed vigor and strength of heart, again touched its chords"
533,C.S.A.,"and drew forth in rich tones and glorious melodies his grand poem, ""Reunited""."
534,C.S.A.,"Then it was that the star of peace shone out in the heavens,"
535,C.S.A.,"resplendent with the brightness and purity of love,"
536,C.S.A.,and dispelled the dark and foul spirit of hate which had poisoned the air
537,C.S.A.,"and polluted the soil of free Columbia.  Then, too,"
538,C.S.A.,the angel of affliction and the angel of charity joined hands together
539,C.S.A.,and pronounced the benediction over a restored Union and a reunited people.
540,C.S.A.,
541,C.S.A.,"Before proceeding to speak of Father Ryan's poems, a few observations"
542,C.S.A.,upon poets and poetry in general may not be deemed inappropriate.
543,C.S.A.,"To speak of poets and their merits is by no means an easy matter,"
544,C.S.A.,even where one is in every respect fitted to pronounce critical judgment.
545,C.S.A.,It requires rare qualifications for such a task; a wide range of information;
546,C.S.A.,extensive knowledge of the various authors; a keen sense of justice;
547,C.S.A.,"a fine sense of appreciation of the merits and demerits of each,"
548,C.S.A.,and a rare power of discrimination.  These are qualifications seldom combined
549,C.S.A.,in a single person.  Hence so few competent critics are to be found.
550,C.S.A.,The writer does not claim to possess all or any one of these powers
551,C.S.A.,in as eminent degree as would fit him for the work of passing
552,C.S.A.,judicious criticism upon the various authors and their works --
553,C.S.A.,"or, indeed, any single one of them.  What he will venture to say, therefore,"
554,C.S.A.,is by way of preface to the remarks which he is called upon to offer
555,C.S.A.,upon the merits of the particular poet whose productions
556,C.S.A.,he is specially called upon to consider.
557,C.S.A.,
558,C.S.A.,"Of poets it may be said, that they are not like other men,"
559,C.S.A.,though invested with similar qualities and characteristics.
560,C.S.A.,They differ in this:  That they are not cold and calculating in their speech;
561,C.S.A.,they do not analyze and weigh their words with the same precision;
562,C.S.A.,nor are they always master of their feelings.  Possessed of
563,C.S.A.,"the subtle power of genius, which no mortal can describe,"
564,C.S.A.,"though all may experience its potent influence, they cannot be confined"
565,C.S.A.,"within the narrow limits assigned to others less gifted,"
566,C.S.A.,nor subjected to fixed methods or unvarying processes of mental action.
567,C.S.A.,"No; poets must roam in broader fields, amidst brighter prospects"
568,C.S.A.,"and more elevated surroundings.  They must be left to themselves,"
569,C.S.A.,"to go where they choose, and evolve their thoughts according to"
570,C.S.A.,their own ways and fancies; for ways and fancies they have
571,C.S.A.,which are peculiar to themselves and must be indulged.  Genius is ever wont
572,C.S.A.,"to be odd, in the sense that it does not and cannot be made to move"
573,C.S.A.,"in common ruts and channels.  This is especially true of poetic genius,"
574,C.S.A.,whose life may be said to depend upon the purity of its inspirations
575,C.S.A.,and the breadth and character of its surroundings.
576,C.S.A.,
577,C.S.A.,"Much has been said, and deservedly, in favor of the great poets of antiquity."
578,C.S.A.,Unmeasured praise has been bestowed upon the epic grandeur of Homer
579,C.S.A.,and the classical purity of Virgil.  They have ever been considered
580,C.S.A.,as foremost amongst the best models of poetic excellence.
581,C.S.A.,"Yet there was wanting to them the true sources of poetic inspiration,"
582,C.S.A.,whence flow the loftiest conceptions and sublimest emanations of genius.
583,C.S.A.,"Homer never rose above the summit of Olympus, nor Virgil above the level of"
584,C.S.A.,pagan subjects and surroundings.  Therefore they cannot be properly regarded
585,C.S.A.,"as the highest and best models, certainly not the safest for Christians,"
586,C.S.A.,who can feast their eyes and fill their minds and hearts with more
587,C.S.A.,"perfect models and more sublime subjects.  The sight of Sinai, where Jehovah,"
588,C.S.A.,"the God of Israel, is veiled in the awful splendor of His Majesty,"
589,C.S.A.,whilst his voice is heard in the loud war and fierce thunderings
590,C.S.A.,"amongst the clouds, as the lightnings crown its summit,"
591,C.S.A.,"is far more grand and imposing, more sublime and inspiring,"
592,C.S.A.,"than are those subjects presented to us by pagan authors,"
593,C.S.A.,however refined and elegant may be the language employed
594,C.S.A.,"to convey their thoughts and depict their scenes.  Wherefore,"
595,C.S.A.,the Biblical narratives furnish the highest and best models
596,C.S.A.,"and the richest sources of poetic inspiration; and ""all great poets"
597,C.S.A.,have had recourse to those ever-living fountains to learn the secret
598,C.S.A.,"of elevating our hearts, ennobling our affections, and finding subjects"
599,C.S.A.,"worthy of their genius."""
600,C.S.A.,
601,C.S.A.,The writer would not care to assert that Father Ryan's poems possess
602,C.S.A.,"the majestic grandeur and elaborate finish of the great masters,"
603,C.S.A.,"whose productions have withstood the severe criticism of ages,"
604,C.S.A.,and still stand as the highest models of poetic excellence.
605,C.S.A.,"His style is not that of Milton, who soared aloft into the eternal mansions"
606,C.S.A.,"and opened their portals to our astonished and admiring gaze,"
607,C.S.A.,"picturing to us ""God in His first frown and man in his first prevarication."""
608,C.S.A.,"Nor is it that of Shakespeare, whose deep and subtle mind"
609,C.S.A.,"fathomed ""the dark abysses of the human heart,"" and laid bare and naked"
610,C.S.A.,"the varied doings of mankind!  Nor is it, least of all,"
611,C.S.A.,"that of Dante, who, with even greater boldness than Milton,"
612,C.S.A.,"plunged into the impenetrable depths of the infernal regions,"
613,C.S.A.,whose appalling misery and never-ending woe he has described
614,C.S.A.,in words of fearful and awe-inspiring grandeur.  Neither is his style
615,C.S.A.,"like unto that of any one of the several leading American poets,"
616,C.S.A.,"so far as their works are known to the writer, though some have said"
617,C.S.A.,that his style resembles that of the highly gifted and lamented Poe.
618,C.S.A.,
619,C.S.A.,The writer will not undertake to say what place Father Ryan
620,C.S.A.,"will occupy in the Temple of Fame, though he believes that"
621,C.S.A.,an enlightened public sentiment would accord to him a high position.
622,C.S.A.,The chief merits of his poems would seem to be the simple sublimity
623,C.S.A.,of his verses; the rare and chaste beauty of his conceptions;
624,C.S.A.,"the richness and grandeur of his thoughts, and their easy, natural flow;"
625,C.S.A.,the refined elegance and captivating force of the terms he employs
626,C.S.A.,as the medium through which he communicates those thoughts
627,C.S.A.,and the weird fancy which throws around them charms peculiarly their own.
628,C.S.A.,"These, and perhaps other merits, will win for their author enduring fame."
629,C.S.A.,
630,C.S.A.,For the future of Father Ryan's poems we need have no fears.
631,C.S.A.,"They will pass down through the ages bearing the stamp of genius,"
632,C.S.A.,"impressed with the majesty of truth, replete with the power"
633,C.S.A.,and grandeur of love; these are the purest sources of poetic inspiration;
634,C.S.A.,"for both are attributes of the Divinity.  Strip poetry of these,"
635,C.S.A.,and nothing remains but its mutilated relics and soulless body;
636,C.S.A.,it becomes robbed of its highest glory and its most enduring qualities.
637,C.S.A.,
638,C.S.A.,"Though the South may claim Father Ryan as her son of genius,"
639,C.S.A.,whose heart beat in sympathy with her hopes and her aspirations
640,C.S.A.,"and of whose productions she may well feel proud, yet no section owns him,"
641,C.S.A.,"since he belongs to our common country, and in a certain sense to mankind,"
642,C.S.A.,for the fame of genius is not controlled by sections
643,C.S.A.,or circumscribed within limits; it extends beyond the confines of earth --
644,C.S.A.,"yea, unto eternity itself!  It is proper to regard him in this light"
645,C.S.A.,"as the heritage of the nation, for in the nation's keeping"
646,C.S.A.,his fame will be secure and appropriately perpetuated.
647,C.S.A.,"All sections will unite in doing honor to his memory,"
648,C.S.A.,"which is associated with grand intellectual triumphs,"
649,C.S.A.,won by the union of the highest gifts of the Creator --
650,C.S.A.,the union of religion and poetic genius; the former the source and inspiration
651,C.S.A.,of the latter.
652,C.S.A.,
653,C.S.A.,"Father Ryan also wrote several works of prose, chief amongst which"
654,C.S.A.,"is that entitled, ""A Crown for Our Queen"".  Like his poem, ""Last of May"","
655,C.S.A.,"this book was intended as a loving tribute to Mary, the Mother of God,"
656,C.S.A.,whom he wished to honor as the highest type and grandest embodiment
657,C.S.A.,of womanhood.  If Father Ryan failed to make this work worthy
658,C.S.A.,of the exalted subject -- an opinion by no means expressed --
659,C.S.A.,it was not from any lack of good-will and earnest purpose on his part.
660,C.S.A.,With him tender affection for the Queen of Heaven was a pure
661,C.S.A.,"and holy sentiment, a sublime, and ennobling act of piety."
662,C.S.A.,He saw in her lofty and immaculate beauty the true ideal of woman;
663,C.S.A.,and this explains the deep reverence and delicate sentiment
664,C.S.A.,of respect and sympathy which he exhibited towards all women.
665,C.S.A.,"Poetical sentiment and religious feeling he thus happily blended,"
666,C.S.A.,"as they should ever be, directing and influencing man's action"
667,C.S.A.,in his relations and intercourse with woman.
668,C.S.A.,
669,C.S.A.,"Three essentially poetical sentiments exist in man,"
670,C.S.A.,"says a distinguished writer:  The love of God, the love of woman,"
671,C.S.A.,"and the love of country -- the religious, the human,"
672,C.S.A.,"and the political sentiment.  For this reason, continues the same writer,"
673,C.S.A.,"wherever the knowledge of God is darkened, wherever the face of woman"
674,C.S.A.,"is veiled, wherever the people are captive or enslaved, there poetry"
675,C.S.A.,"is like a flame which, for want of fuel, exhausts itself and dies out."
676,C.S.A.,"On the contrary, wherever God reigns upon His throne"
677,C.S.A.,"in all the majesty of His glory, wherever woman rules"
678,C.S.A.,"by the irresistible power of her enchantments, wherever the people are free,"
679,C.S.A.,"there poetry has modest roses for the woman, glorious palms for the people,"
680,C.S.A.,and splendid wings with which to mount up to the loftiest regions of heaven.
681,C.S.A.,
682,C.S.A.,"Father Ryan also won distinction as an orator, a lecturer, and an essayist,"
683,C.S.A.,having contributed to several of the leading journals and magazines
684,C.S.A.,of the country.  His oratory was not of the cold and unimpassioned kind
685,C.S.A.,which falls upon the ears but fails to make an impression on the heart.
686,C.S.A.,He did not lose sight of the fact that the chief end and aim of oratory
687,C.S.A.,"is to arouse men to a sense of duty, deter them from the commission of evil,"
688,C.S.A.,"and inspire them with high and holy purposes and noble, generous resolves,"
689,C.S.A.,"the accomplishment of which demands that the living, breathing spirit or soul"
690,C.S.A.,should be infused into the words.  Though the unction of divine charity
691,C.S.A.,"can alone give efficacy to man's words, yet man must not appear to be devoid"
692,C.S.A.,of those qualities and attributes which contribute towards making
693,C.S.A.,a lasting impression upon the minds and hearts of those
694,C.S.A.,whose interests are presumed to be dear to him.  This was the spirit
695,C.S.A.,"that animated Father Ryan, and all his efforts were directed towards"
696,C.S.A.,the accomplishment of the objects stated.  It is not claimed that
697,C.S.A.,"all his discourses were up to the highest standard of literary excellence,"
698,C.S.A.,or above the test of exact criticism.  Some of his efforts
699,C.S.A.,"did not bear evidence of deep thought or careful and exhaustive preparation,"
700,C.S.A.,but all exhibited warmth of soul and earnestness of purpose.
701,C.S.A.,"It may be well to remark in connection with this, that Father Ryan's health"
702,C.S.A.,for many years was such that it would not permit of his engaging
703,C.S.A.,in laborious mental work.  And yet he labored much and spoke often;
704,C.S.A.,for his zeal and mental activity were greatly in excess of his strength.
705,C.S.A.,"Had his physical powers corresponded to his rare mental endowments,"
706,C.S.A.,the value of his productions -- great as it now is --
707,C.S.A.,would have been enhanced.  The marvel is that he was able to sustain
708,C.S.A.,those powers of mind which marked him up to the time of his death.
709,C.S.A.,
710,C.S.A.,"Though he had been ailing for years, as has been stated,"
711,C.S.A.,yet his wonderful energy of mind made it appear to many that there was
712,C.S.A.,"no immediate danger of his life.  When the end came it was a surprise to all,"
713,C.S.A.,even himself.  To him let us hope that it was not unprovided for.
714,C.S.A.,We have the gratifying assurance that it was not so; for we are told
715,C.S.A.,"that he had retired into a Franciscan monastery in Louisville, Ky.,"
716,C.S.A.,"to make a retreat, intending, at its close, to finish a ""Life of Christ"","
717,C.S.A.,"on which he was engaged, or purposed to undertake.  Little did he think,"
718,C.S.A.,"apparently at least, that the Angel of Death pursued him"
719,C.S.A.,and would soon deliver the final message to him.  He did not fear the end.
720,C.S.A.,Why should he?  Death has no terrors for the truly Christian soul.
721,C.S.A.,"It is not the end, but the beginning of life; not the destroyer,"
722,C.S.A.,but the restorer of our rights -- that which puts us in possession
723,C.S.A.,of our eternal home in heaven.  Therefore he was not gloomy nor despondent
724,C.S.A.,at the sight of the grave.  He saw beyond it the glorious sunshine
725,C.S.A.,of God's presence and the cheering prospect of his love.
726,C.S.A.,"The final moment at last came and found him prepared.  On the 23d of April,"
727,C.S.A.,"1886, the soul of Abram J. Ryan, priest and poet, beloved of all who knew him,"
728,C.S.A.,"passed quietly away, let us hope, from earth to heaven, there to sing"
729,C.S.A.,"the glorious songs whose melodies are attuned to the harps of angels,"
730,C.S.A.,and whose mysterious harmonies ravish with delight the pure souls of the just.
731,C.S.A.,"As the setting sun on a calm eve sinks beneath the horizon,"
732,C.S.A.,"gilding the heavens with its mild yet gorgeous splendor,"
733,C.S.A.,"so did the grand soul of Father Ryan pass into eternity,"
734,C.S.A.,leaving behind the bright light of his genius and virtues --
735,C.S.A.,"the one to illumine the firmament of literature, and the other to serve"
736,C.S.A.,as a shining example to men.
737,C.S.A.,
738,C.S.A.,"Here the writer would end this imperfect tribute to a truly great character,"
739,C.S.A.,did he not wish to remind the reader that he must not regard it
740,C.S.A.,"as an entire portrait of the illustrious dead, though he has tried"
741,C.S.A.,"to present him clothed with some, at least, of the attributes and qualities"
742,C.S.A.,"which marked him during life.  The failure, if such it be,"
743,C.S.A.,must be ascribed to his own want of skill and ability
744,C.S.A.,rather than to any lack of merit in the subject.  If he has not invested him
745,C.S.A.,"with the panoply of his greatness, he has endeavored to strew some flowers"
746,C.S.A.,"over his grave; and these are love's purest and best offering,"
747,C.S.A.,"which, were he living, would be most acceptable to the heart of the poet;"
748,C.S.A.,for love it was that inspired its tenderest promptings and holiest feelings
749,C.S.A.,and consecrated them to its ennobling influence.
750,C.S.A.,
751,C.S.A.,"Another thought, and the writer will bring his remarks to a close."
752,C.S.A.,"This thought will be borrowed from the dead priest's poem, ""Reunited"","
753,C.S.A.,to suggest a sentiment in response to his prayer for a union of all sections
754,C.S.A.,-- a sentiment which cannot fail to meet a ready and generous acceptance
755,C.S.A.,on the part of all true lovers of liberty.  The thought is embodied
756,C.S.A.,"in the following words, which take the form of an appeal:"
757,C.S.A.,
758,C.S.A.,Let all hearts join in the wish that the valor displayed

760,C.S.A.,may henceforth unite all sections of our common country more closely
761,C.S.A.,"in the bonds of fraternal affection, and cement more firmly"
762,C.S.A.,"the foundations of our political superstructure, now so vast and imposing,"
763,C.S.A.,"thus serving as a guaranty for the stability, permanence,"
764,C.S.A.,and enduring greatness of the Republic!  Thus will we respond
765,C.S.A.,"to the prayer of the dead priest, whose poem, the ""Lost Cause"","
766,C.S.A.,"and song of ""The Conquered Banner"", will mingle harmoniously"
767,C.S.A.,"with the soft, earnest words and sweet, placid tones"
768,C.S.A.,"of his peaceful ""Reunited"".  So the songs of the dead poet"
769,C.S.A.,will be music to the living until time shall be no more!

791,C.S.A.,And I hear not the fall of a footstep
792,C.S.A.,"Around me, save God's and my own;"
793,C.S.A.,And the hush of my heart is as holy
794,C.S.A.,As hovers where angels have flown!
795,C.S.A.,
796,C.S.A.,Long ago was I weary of voices
797,C.S.A.,Whose music my heart could not win;
798,C.S.A.,Long ago was I weary of noises
799,C.S.A.,That fretted my soul with their din;

801,C.S.A.,Where I met but the human -- and sin.
802,C.S.A.,
803,C.S.A.,I walked in the world with the worldly;
804,C.S.A.,I craved what the world never gave;
805,C.S.A.,"And I said:  ""In the world each Ideal,"
806,C.S.A.,"That shines like a star on life's wave,"
807,C.S.A.,"Is wrecked on the shores of the Real,"
808,C.S.A.,"And sleeps like a dream in a grave."""
809,C.S.A.,
810,C.S.A.,"And still did I pine for the Perfect,"
811,C.S.A.,And still found the False with the True;
812,C.S.A.,"I sought 'mid the Human for Heaven,"
813,C.S.A.,But caught a mere glimpse of its Blue:
814,C.S.A.,And I wept when the clouds of the Mortal
815,C.S.A.,Veiled even that glimpse from my view.
816,C.S.A.,
817,C.S.A.,"And I toiled on, heart-tired, of the Human,"
818,C.S.A.,"And I moaned 'mid the mazes of men,"

820,C.S.A.,And I heard a voice call me.  Since then
821,C.S.A.,I walk down the Valley of Silence
822,C.S.A.,That lies far beyond mortal ken.
823,C.S.A.,
824,C.S.A.,Do you ask what I found in the Valley?
825,C.S.A.,'Tis my Trysting Place with the Divine.
826,C.S.A.,"And I fell at the feet of the Holy,"
827,C.S.A.,"And above me a voice said:  ""Be mine."""
828,C.S.A.,And there arose from the depths of my spirit
829,C.S.A.,"An echo -- ""My heart shall be Thine."""
830,C.S.A.,
831,C.S.A.,Do you ask how I live in the Valley?
832,C.S.A.,I weep -- and I dream -- and I pray.
833,C.S.A.,But my tears are as sweet as the dewdrops
834,C.S.A.,That fall on the roses in May;
835,C.S.A.,"And my prayer, like a perfume from censers,"
836,C.S.A.,Ascendeth to God night and day.
837,C.S.A.,
838,C.S.A.,In the hush of the Valley of Silence
839,C.S.A.,I dream all the songs that I sing;
840,C.S.A.,"And the music floats down the dim Valley,"
841,C.S.A.,"Till each finds a word for a wing,"
842,C.S.A.,"That to hearts, like the Dove of the Deluge,"
843,C.S.A.,A message of Peace they may bring.
844,C.S.A.,
845,C.S.A.,But far on the deep there are billows
846,C.S.A.,That never shall break on the beach;
847,C.S.A.,And I have heard songs in the Silence
848,C.S.A.,That never shall float into speech;
849,C.S.A.,And I have had dreams in the Valley
850,C.S.A.,Too lofty for language to reach.
851,C.S.A.,
852,C.S.A.,And I have seen Thoughts in the Valley --
853,C.S.A.,"Ah! me, how my spirit was stirred!"
854,C.S.A.,"And they wear holy veils on their faces,"
855,C.S.A.,Their footsteps can scarcely be heard;
856,C.S.A.,"They pass through the Valley like virgins,"
857,C.S.A.,Too pure for the touch of a word!
858,C.S.A.,
859,C.S.A.,"Do you ask me the place of the Valley,"
860,C.S.A.,Ye hearts that are harrowed by Care?
861,C.S.A.,"It lieth afar between mountains,"
862,C.S.A.,And God and His angels are there:

1159,C.S.A.,'Twas more than half an age; 'tis ever thus.
1160,C.S.A.,"Words came at last,"
1161,C.S.A.,Fluttering and fast
1162,C.S.A.,As shadows veiling sunsets in the souls
1163,C.S.A.,Of each of us.
1164,C.S.A.,
1165,C.S.A.,The noiseless night
1166,C.S.A.,Sped flitting like a ghost where waves of blue
1167,C.S.A.,"Lost all their light,"
1168,C.S.A.,As lips once bright
1169,C.S.A.,"Whence smiles have fled; we or the wavelets sighed,"
1170,C.S.A.,And -- we were two.
1171,C.S.A.,
1172,C.S.A.,The day had gone:
1173,C.S.A.,"And on the dim, high altar of the dark,"
1174,C.S.A.,"Stars, one by one,"
1175,C.S.A.,"Far, faintly shone;"
1176,C.S.A.,"The moonlight trembled, like a mother's smile,"
1177,C.S.A.,Upon our bark.
1178,C.S.A.,
1179,C.S.A.,We softly spoke:
1180,C.S.A.,"The waves seemed listening on the lonely sea,"
1181,C.S.A.,The winds awoke;
1182,C.S.A.,Our whispers broke
1183,C.S.A.,"The spell of silence; and two eyes unclosed,"
1184,C.S.A.,And -- we were three.
1185,C.S.A.,
1186,C.S.A.,"""The breeze blows fair,"""
1187,C.S.A.,"He said; ""the waking waves set towards the shore."""
1188,C.S.A.,The long brown hair
1189,C.S.A.,"Of the other there,"
1190,C.S.A.,Who slumbered near the mast with dreamy face
1191,C.S.A.,Stirred -- we were four.
1192,C.S.A.,
1193,C.S.A.,"That starry night,"
1194,C.S.A.,"A mile or so of shadows from the shore,"
1195,C.S.A.,Two faces bright
1196,C.S.A.,With laughter light
1197,C.S.A.,Shone on two souls like stars that shine on shrines;
1198,C.S.A.,And -- we were four.
1199,C.S.A.,
1200,C.S.A.,Over the reach
1201,C.S.A.,Of dazzling waves our boat like wild bird flew;
1202,C.S.A.,"We reached the beach,"
1203,C.S.A.,"Nor song, nor speech"
1204,C.S.A.,Shall ever tell our sacramental thought
1205,C.S.A.,When -- we were two.
1206,C.S.A.,
1207,C.S.A.,
1208,C.S.A.,
1209,C.S.A.,
1210,C.S.A.,"Nocturne [""I sit to-night by the firelight,""]"
1211,C.S.A.,
1212,C.S.A.,
1213,C.S.A.,
1214,C.S.A.,"I sit to-night by the firelight,"
1215,C.S.A.,"And I look at the glowing flame,"
1216,C.S.A.,And I see in the bright red flashes
1217,C.S.A.,"A Heart, a Face, and a Name."
1218,C.S.A.,
1219,C.S.A.,How often have I seen pictures
1220,C.S.A.,"Framed in the firelight's blaze,"
1221,C.S.A.,"Of hearts, of names, and of faces,"
1222,C.S.A.,And scenes of remembered days!
1223,C.S.A.,
1224,C.S.A.,How often have I found poems
1225,C.S.A.,"In the crimson of the coals,"
1226,C.S.A.,And the swaying flames of the firelight
1227,C.S.A.,Unrolled such golden scrolls.
1228,C.S.A.,
1229,C.S.A.,"And my eyes, they were proud to read them,"
1230,C.S.A.,"In letters of living flame,"
1231,C.S.A.,"But to-night, in the fire, I see only"
1232,C.S.A.,"One Heart, one Face, and one Name."
1233,C.S.A.,
1234,C.S.A.,But where are the olden pictures?
1235,C.S.A.,And where are the olden dreams?
1236,C.S.A.,Has a change come over my vision?
1237,C.S.A.,Or over the fire's bright gleams?
1238,C.S.A.,
1239,C.S.A.,"Not over my vision, surely;"
1240,C.S.A.,"My eyes -- they are still the same,"
1241,C.S.A.,That used to find in the firelight
1242,C.S.A.,So many a face and name.
1243,C.S.A.,
1244,C.S.A.,"Not over the firelight, either,"
1245,C.S.A.,No change in the coals or blaze
1246,C.S.A.,"That flicker and flash, as ruddy"
1247,C.S.A.,To-night as in other days.
1248,C.S.A.,
1249,C.S.A.,But there must be a change -- I feel it.
1250,C.S.A.,To-night not an old picture came;
1251,C.S.A.,The fire's bright flames only painted
1252,C.S.A.,"One Heart, one Face, and one Name."
1253,C.S.A.,
1254,C.S.A.,Three pictures?  No! only one picture;
1255,C.S.A.,"The Face belongs to the Name,"
1256,C.S.A.,And the Name names the Heart that is throbbing
1257,C.S.A.,Just back of the beautiful flame.
1258,C.S.A.,
1259,C.S.A.,"Who said it, I wonder:  ""All faces"
1260,C.S.A.,Must fade in the light of but one;
1261,C.S.A.,"The soul, like the earth, may have many"
1262,C.S.A.,"Horizons, but only one sun?"""
1263,C.S.A.,
1264,C.S.A.,Who dreamt it?  Did I?  If I dreamt it
1265,C.S.A.,'Tis true -- every name passes by
1266,C.S.A.,Save one; the sun wears many cloudlets
1267,C.S.A.,"Of gold, but has only one sky."
1268,C.S.A.,
1269,C.S.A.,"And out of the flames have they faded,"
1270,C.S.A.,The hearts and the faces of yore?
1271,C.S.A.,Have they sunk 'neath the gray of the ashes
1272,C.S.A.,To rise to my vision no more?
1273,C.S.A.,
1274,C.S.A.,"Yes, surely, or else I would see them"
1275,C.S.A.,"To-night, just as bright as of old,"
1276,C.S.A.,"In the white of the coal's silver flashes,"
1277,C.S.A.,In the red of the restless flames' gold.
1278,C.S.A.,
1279,C.S.A.,Do you say I am fickle and faithless?
1280,C.S.A.,Else why are the old pictures gone?
1281,C.S.A.,And why should the visions of many
1282,C.S.A.,Melt into the vision of one?
1283,C.S.A.,
1284,C.S.A.,"Nay! list to the voice of the Heavens,"
1285,C.S.A.,"""One Eternal alone reigns above."""
1286,C.S.A.,"Is it true? and all else are but idols,"
1287,C.S.A.,So the heart can have only one love?
1288,C.S.A.,
1289,C.S.A.,"Only one, all the rest are but idols,"
1290,C.S.A.,"That fall from their shrines soon or late,"
1291,C.S.A.,"When the Love that is Lord of the temple,"
1292,C.S.A.,Comes with sceptre and crown to the gate.
1293,C.S.A.,
1294,C.S.A.,"To be faithless oft means to be faithful,"
1295,C.S.A.,To be false often means to be true;
1296,C.S.A.,The vale that loves clouds that are golden
1297,C.S.A.,Forgets them for skies that are blue.
1298,C.S.A.,
1299,C.S.A.,To forget often means to remember
1300,C.S.A.,What we had forgotten too long;
1301,C.S.A.,"The fragrance is not the bright flower,"
1302,C.S.A.,The echo is not the sweet song.
1303,C.S.A.,
1304,C.S.A.,"Am I dreaming?  No, there is the firelight,"
1305,C.S.A.,"Gaze I ever so long, all the same"
1306,C.S.A.,I only can see in its glowing
1307,C.S.A.,"A Heart, a Face, and a Name."
1308,C.S.A.,
1309,C.S.A.,"Farewell! all ye hearts, names, and faces!"
1310,C.S.A.,"Only ashes now under the blaze,"
1311,C.S.A.,"Ye never again will smile on me,"
1312,C.S.A.,For I'm touching the end of my days.
1313,C.S.A.,
1314,C.S.A.,And the beautiful fading firelight
1315,C.S.A.,"Paints, now, with a pencil of flame,"
1316,C.S.A.,Three pictures -- yet only one picture --
1317,C.S.A.,"A Heart, a Face, and a Name."
1318,C.S.A.,
1319,C.S.A.,
1320,C.S.A.,
1321,C.S.A.,
1322,C.S.A.,The Old Year and the New
1323,C.S.A.,
1324,C.S.A.,
1325,C.S.A.,
1326,C.S.A.,"How swift they go,"
1327,C.S.A.,"Life's many years,"
1328,C.S.A.,With their winds of woe
1329,C.S.A.,"And their storms of tears,"
1330,C.S.A.,And their darkest of nights whose shadowy slopes
1331,C.S.A.,"Are lit with the flashes of starriest hopes,"
1332,C.S.A.,And their sunshiny days in whose calm heavens loom
1333,C.S.A.,The clouds of the tempest -- the shadows of the gloom!
1334,C.S.A.,
1335,C.S.A.,And ah! we pray
1336,C.S.A.,"With a grief so drear,"
1337,C.S.A.,That the years may stay
1338,C.S.A.,When their graves are near;
1339,C.S.A.,"Tho' the brows of To-morrows be radiant and bright,"
1340,C.S.A.,"With love and with beauty, with life and with light,"
1341,C.S.A.,"The dead hearts of Yesterdays, cold on the bier,"
1342,C.S.A.,"To the hearts that survive them, are evermore dear."
1343,C.S.A.,
1344,C.S.A.,For the hearts so true
1345,C.S.A.,To each Old Year cleaves;
1346,C.S.A.,Tho' the hand of the New
1347,C.S.A.,Flowery garlands weaves.
1348,C.S.A.,"But the flowers of the future, tho' fragrant and fair,"
1349,C.S.A.,With the past's withered leaflets may never compare;
1350,C.S.A.,For dear is each dead leaf -- and dearer each thorn --
1351,C.S.A.,In the wreaths which the brows of our past years have worn.
1352,C.S.A.,
1353,C.S.A.,Yea! men will cling
1354,C.S.A.,"With a love to the last,"
1355,C.S.A.,And wildly fling
1356,C.S.A.,Their arms round their past!
1357,C.S.A.,As the vine that clings to the oak that falls;
1358,C.S.A.,As the ivy twines round the crumbled walls;
1359,C.S.A.,For the dust of the past some hearts higher prize
1360,C.S.A.,Than the stars that flash out from the future's bright skies.
1361,C.S.A.,
1362,C.S.A.,And why not so?
1363,C.S.A.,"The old, Old Years,"
1364,C.S.A.,They knew and they know
1365,C.S.A.,All our hopes and fears;
1366,C.S.A.,"We walked by their side, and we told them each grief,"
1367,C.S.A.,And they kissed off our tears while they whispered relief;
1368,C.S.A.,And the stories of hearts that may not be revealed
1369,C.S.A.,In the hearts of the dead years are buried and sealed.
1370,C.S.A.,
1371,C.S.A.,Let the New Year sing
1372,C.S.A.,At the Old Year's grave:
1373,C.S.A.,Will the New Year bring
1374,C.S.A.,What the Old Year gave?
1375,C.S.A.,"Ah! the Stranger-Year trips over the snows,"
1376,C.S.A.,And his brow is wreathed with many a rose:
1377,C.S.A.,But how many thorns do the roses conceal
1378,C.S.A.,"Which the roses, when withered, shall so soon reveal?"
1379,C.S.A.,
1380,C.S.A.,Let the New Year smile
1381,C.S.A.,When the Old Year dies;
1382,C.S.A.,In how short a while
1383,C.S.A.,Shall the smiles be sighs?
1384,C.S.A.,"Yea! Stranger-Year, thou hast many a charm,"
1385,C.S.A.,"And thy face is fair and thy greeting warm,"
1386,C.S.A.,"But, dearer than thou -- in his shroud of snows --"
1387,C.S.A.,Is the furrowed face of the Year that goes.
1388,C.S.A.,
1389,C.S.A.,"Yea! bright New Year,"
1390,C.S.A.,"O'er all the earth,"
1391,C.S.A.,"With song and cheer,"
1392,C.S.A.,They will hail thy birth;
1393,C.S.A.,"They will trust thy words in a single hour,"
1394,C.S.A.,"They will love thy face, they will laud thy power;"
1395,C.S.A.,"For the ~New~ has charms which the ~Old~ has not,"
1396,C.S.A.,And the Stranger's face makes the Friend's forgot.
1397,C.S.A.,

1405,C.S.A.,Unroll Erin's flag! fling its folds to the breeze!
1406,C.S.A.,"Let it float o'er the land, let it flash o'er the seas!"
1407,C.S.A.,"Lift it out of the dust -- let it wave as of yore,"
1408,C.S.A.,When its chiefs with their clans stood around it and swore
1409,C.S.A.,"That never! no, never! while God gave them life,"
1410,C.S.A.,"And they had an arm and a sword for the strife,"
1411,C.S.A.,"That never! no, never! that banner should yield"
1412,C.S.A.,As long as the heart of a Celt was its shield:
1413,C.S.A.,While the hand of a Celt had a weapon to wield
1414,C.S.A.,And his last drop of blood was unshed on the field.
1415,C.S.A.,
1416,C.S.A.,Lift it up! wave it high! 'tis as bright as of old!
1417,C.S.A.,"Not a stain on its green, not a blot on its gold,"
1418,C.S.A.,Tho' the woes and the wrongs of three hundred long years
1419,C.S.A.,Have drenched Erin's sunburst with blood and with tears!
1420,C.S.A.,"Though the clouds of oppression enshroud it in gloom,"
1421,C.S.A.,And around it the thunders of Tyranny boom.
1422,C.S.A.,"Look aloft! look aloft! lo! the clouds drifting by,"
1423,C.S.A.,"There's a gleam through the gloom, there's a light in the sky,"
1424,C.S.A.,"'Tis the sunburst resplendent -- far, flashing on high!"
1425,C.S.A.,"Erin's dark night is waning, her day-dawn is nigh!"
1426,C.S.A.,
1427,C.S.A.,Lift it up! lift it up! the old Banner of Green!
1428,C.S.A.,The blood of its sons has but brightened its sheen;
1429,C.S.A.,"What though the tyrant has trampled it down,"
1430,C.S.A.,Are its folds not emblazoned with deeds of renown?
1431,C.S.A.,"What though for ages it droops in the dust,"
1432,C.S.A.,"Shall it droop thus forever?  No, no!  God is just!"
1433,C.S.A.,"Take it up! take it up! from the tyrant's foul tread,"
1434,C.S.A.,"Let him tear the Green Flag -- we will snatch its last shred,"
1435,C.S.A.,"And beneath it we'll bleed as our forefathers bled,"
1436,C.S.A.,"And we'll vow by the dust in the graves of our dead,"
1437,C.S.A.,"And we'll swear by the blood which the Briton has shed,"
1438,C.S.A.,"And we'll vow by the wrecks which through Erin he spread,"
1439,C.S.A.,"And we'll swear by the thousands who, famished, unfed,"
1440,C.S.A.,"Died down in the ditches, wild-howling for bread;"
1441,C.S.A.,"And we'll vow by our heroes, whose spirits have fled,"
1442,C.S.A.,"And we'll swear by the bones in each coffinless bed,"
1443,C.S.A.,That we'll battle the Briton through danger and dread;
1444,C.S.A.,"That we'll cling to the cause which we glory to wed,"
1445,C.S.A.,'Til the gleam of our steel and the shock of our lead
1446,C.S.A.,Shall prove to our foe that we meant what we said --
1447,C.S.A.,"That we'll lift up the green, and we'll tear down the red!"
1448,C.S.A.,
1449,C.S.A.,"Lift up the Green Flag! oh! it wants to go home,"
1450,C.S.A.,"Full long has its lot been to wander and roam,"
1451,C.S.A.,"It has followed the fate of its sons o'er the world,"
1452,C.S.A.,"But its folds, like their hopes, are not faded nor furled;"
1453,C.S.A.,"Like a weary-winged bird, to the East and the West,"
1454,C.S.A.,"It has flitted and fled -- but it never shall rest,"
1455,C.S.A.,"'Til, pluming its pinions, it sweeps o'er the main,"
1456,C.S.A.,"And speeds to the shores of its old home again,"
1457,C.S.A.,Where its fetterless folds o'er each mountain and plain
1458,C.S.A.,Shall wave with a glory that never shall wane.
1459,C.S.A.,
1460,C.S.A.,Take it up! take it up! bear it back from afar!
1461,C.S.A.,That banner must blaze 'mid the lightnings of war;
1462,C.S.A.,"Lay your hands on its folds, lift your gaze to the sky,"
1463,C.S.A.,"And swear that you'll bear it triumphant or die,"
1464,C.S.A.,And shout to the clans scattered far o'er the earth
1465,C.S.A.,To join in the march to the land of their birth;
1466,C.S.A.,"And wherever the Exiles, 'neath heaven's broad dome,"
1467,C.S.A.,"Have been fated to suffer, to sorrow and roam,"

1539,C.S.A.,A smile flitted over the baby's face:
1540,C.S.A.,Or was it the gleam of its angel's wing
1541,C.S.A.,"Just passing then, and leaving a trace"
1542,C.S.A.,Of its presence as it soared to sing?
1543,C.S.A.,A hymn when words and waters win
1544,C.S.A.,To grace and life a child of sin.
1545,C.S.A.,
1546,C.S.A.,"Not an outward sign or token,"
1547,C.S.A.,That a child was saved from woe;
1548,C.S.A.,"But the bonds of sin were broken,"
1549,C.S.A.,"And the babe laughed, sweet and low."
1550,C.S.A.,
1551,C.S.A.,"A cloud rose up to the mother's eyes,"
1552,C.S.A.,And out of the cloud grief's rain fell fast;
1553,C.S.A.,"Came the baby's smiles, and the mother's sighs,"
1554,C.S.A.,"Out of the future, or the past?"
1555,C.S.A.,"Ah! gleam and gloom must ever meet,"
1556,C.S.A.,And gall must mingle with the sweet.
1557,C.S.A.,
1558,C.S.A.,"Yea, upon the baby's laughter"
1559,C.S.A.,Trickled tears:  'tis ever so --
1560,C.S.A.,Mothers dread the dark hereafter;
1561,C.S.A.,But the babe laughed sweet and low.
1562,C.S.A.,
1563,C.S.A.,And the years like waves broke on the shore
1564,C.S.A.,"Of the mother's heart, and her baby's life;"
1565,C.S.A.,But her lone heart drifted away before
1566,C.S.A.,Her little boy knew an hour of strife;
1567,C.S.A.,"Drifted away on a Summer's eve,"
1568,C.S.A.,Ere the orphaned child knew how to grieve
1569,C.S.A.,
1570,C.S.A.,Her humble grave was gently made
1571,C.S.A.,Where roses bloomed in Summer's glow;
1572,C.S.A.,"The wild birds sang where her heart was laid,"
1573,C.S.A.,And her boy laughed sweet and low.
1574,C.S.A.,
1575,C.S.A.,"He drifted away from his mother's grave,"
1576,C.S.A.,"Like a fragile flower on a great stream's tide,"
1577,C.S.A.,"Till he heard the moan of the mighty wave,"
1578,C.S.A.,That welcomed the stream to the ocean wide.
1579,C.S.A.,"Out from the shore and over the deep,"
1580,C.S.A.,He sailed away and learned to weep.
1581,C.S.A.,
1582,C.S.A.,"Furrowed grew the face once fair,"
1583,C.S.A.,Under storms of human woe;
1584,C.S.A.,"Silvered grew the dark brown hair,"
1585,C.S.A.,And he wailed so sad and low.
1586,C.S.A.,
1587,C.S.A.,"The years swept on as erst they swept,"
1588,C.S.A.,"Bright wavelets once, dark billows now;"
1589,C.S.A.,"Wherever he sailed he ever wept,"
1590,C.S.A.,A cloud hung over the darkened brow --
1591,C.S.A.,"Over the deep and into the dark,"
1592,C.S.A.,But no one knew where sank his bark.
1593,C.S.A.,
1594,C.S.A.,"Wild roses watched his mother's tomb,"
1595,C.S.A.,"The world still laughed, 'tis ever so --"
1596,C.S.A.,"God only knows the baby's doom,"
1597,C.S.A.,That laughed so sweet and low.
1598,C.S.A.,
1599,C.S.A.,
1600,C.S.A.,
1601,C.S.A.,
1602,C.S.A.,A Laugh -- and A Moan

1605,C.S.A.,
1606,C.S.A.,The brook that down the valley
1607,C.S.A.,"So musically drips,"
1608,C.S.A.,Flowed never half so brightly
1609,C.S.A.,As the light laugh from her lips.
1610,C.S.A.,
1611,C.S.A.,"Her face was like the lily,"
1612,C.S.A.,"Her heart was like the rose,"
1613,C.S.A.,Her eyes were like a heaven
1614,C.S.A.,Where the sunlight always glows.
1615,C.S.A.,
1616,C.S.A.,She trod the earth so lightly
1617,C.S.A.,Her feet touched not a thorn;
1618,C.S.A.,Her words wore all the brightness
1619,C.S.A.,Of a young life's happy morn.
1620,C.S.A.,
1621,C.S.A.,Along her laughter rippled
1622,C.S.A.,The melody of joy;
1623,C.S.A.,"She drank from every chalice,"
1624,C.S.A.,And tasted no alloy.
1625,C.S.A.,
1626,C.S.A.,"Her life was all a laughter,"
1627,C.S.A.,"Her days were all a smile,"
1628,C.S.A.,"Her heart was pure and happy,"
1629,C.S.A.,She knew not gloom nor guile.
1630,C.S.A.,
1631,C.S.A.,She rested on the bosom
1632,C.S.A.,"Of her mother, like a flower"
1633,C.S.A.,That blooms far in a valley
1634,C.S.A.,Where no storm-clouds ever lower.
1635,C.S.A.,
1636,C.S.A.,"And -- ""Merry, merry, merry!"""
1637,C.S.A.,"Rang the bells of every hour,"
1638,C.S.A.,"And -- ""Happy, happy, happy!"""
1639,C.S.A.,In her valley laughed the flower.
1640,C.S.A.,
1641,C.S.A.,"There was not a sign of shadow,"
1642,C.S.A.,"There was not a tear nor thorn,"
1643,C.S.A.,And the sweet voice of her laughter
1644,C.S.A.,Filled with melody the morn.
1645,C.S.A.,
1646,C.S.A.,*    *    *    *    *
1647,C.S.A.,
1648,C.S.A.,"Years passed -- 'twas long, long after,"
1649,C.S.A.,And I saw a face at prayer;
1650,C.S.A.,"There was not a sign of laughter,"
1651,C.S.A.,There was every sign of care.
1652,C.S.A.,
1653,C.S.A.,For the sunshine all had faded
1654,C.S.A.,"From the valley and the flower,"
1655,C.S.A.,And the once fair face was shaded
1656,C.S.A.,In life's lonely evening hour.
1657,C.S.A.,
1658,C.S.A.,And the lips that smiled with laughter
1659,C.S.A.,"In the valley of the morn,"
1660,C.S.A.,In the valley of the evening
1661,C.S.A.,They were pale and sorrow-worn.
1662,C.S.A.,
1663,C.S.A.,"And I read the old, old lesson"
1664,C.S.A.,"In her face and in her tears,"
1665,C.S.A.,While she sighed amid the shadows
1666,C.S.A.,Of the sunset of her years.
1667,C.S.A.,
1668,C.S.A.,All the rippling streams of laughter
1669,C.S.A.,"From our hearts and lips that flow,"
1670,C.S.A.,"Shall be frozen, cold years after,"
1671,C.S.A.,Into icicles of woe.

1682,C.S.A.,"Brave as the bravest he marched away,"
1683,C.S.A.,(Hot tears on the cheeks of his mother lay)
1684,C.S.A.,Triumphant waved our flag one day --
1685,C.S.A.,He fell in the front before it.
1686,C.S.A.,
1687,C.S.A.,"Firm as the firmest, where duty led,"
1688,C.S.A.,He hurried without a falter;
1689,C.S.A.,"Bold as the boldest he fought and bled,"
1690,C.S.A.,And the day was won -- but the field was red --
1691,C.S.A.,And the blood of his fresh young heart was shed
1692,C.S.A.,On his country's hallowed altar.
1693,C.S.A.,
1694,C.S.A.,On the trampled breast of the battle plain
1695,C.S.A.,"Where the foremost ranks had wrestled,"
1696,C.S.A.,"On his pale, pure face not a mark of pain,"
1697,C.S.A.,(His mother dreams they will meet again)
1698,C.S.A.,"The fairest form amid all the slain,"
1699,C.S.A.,Like a child asleep he nestled.
1700,C.S.A.,
1701,C.S.A.,In the solemn shades of the wood that swept
1702,C.S.A.,"The field where his comrades found him,"
1703,C.S.A.,They buried him there -- and the big tears crept
1704,C.S.A.,Into strong men's eyes that had seldom wept.
1705,C.S.A.,"(His mother -- God pity her -- smiled and slept,"
1706,C.S.A.,Dreaming her arms were around him.)
1707,C.S.A.,
1708,C.S.A.,"A grave in the woods with the grass o'ergrown,"
1709,C.S.A.,A grave in the heart of his mother --
1710,C.S.A.,His clay in the one lies lifeless and lone;
1711,C.S.A.,"There is not a name, there is not a stone,"
1712,C.S.A.,And only the voice of the winds maketh moan
1713,C.S.A.,O'er the grave where never a flower is strewn
1714,C.S.A.,But -- his memory lives in the other.

1726,C.S.A.,Not a light shone down on the lone ship's path;
1727,C.S.A.,The clouds hung low:

1731,C.S.A.,Lost!  Lost!  Lost!
1732,C.S.A.,The cry floated over the waves --

1734,C.S.A.,It smote on the dark and it rended the clouds;
1735,C.S.A.,The billows below them were weaving white shrouds
1736,C.S.A.,"Out of the foam of the surge,"

1754,C.S.A.,"And the waves and the winds of the storm were hushed,"
1755,C.S.A.,And the sky with the gleams of the stars was flushed.
1756,C.S.A.,Saved!  Saved!  Saved!
1757,C.S.A.,And a calm and a joyous cry

1777,C.S.A.,
1778,C.S.A.,The waving rose with every breath
1779,C.S.A.,Scents carelessly the summer air;
1780,C.S.A.,The wounded rose bleeds forth in death

1940,C.S.A.,And grassy fringe of greenest hue
1941,C.S.A.,Hung round its borders everywhere.
1942,C.S.A.,
1943,C.S.A.,"And where the stream, in wayward whirls,"
1944,C.S.A.,"Went winding in and winding out,"
1945,C.S.A.,"Lay shells, that wore the look of pearls"
1946,C.S.A.,"Without their pride, all strewn about."
1947,C.S.A.,
1948,C.S.A.,"And here and there along the strand,"
1949,C.S.A.,"Where some ambitious wave had strayed,"
1950,C.S.A.,Rose little monuments of sand
1951,C.S.A.,As frail as those by mortals made.
1952,C.S.A.,
1953,C.S.A.,And many a flower was blooming there
1954,C.S.A.,"In beauty, yet without a name,"
1955,C.S.A.,Like humble hearts that often bear
1956,C.S.A.,"The gifts, but not the palm of fame."
1957,C.S.A.,
1958,C.S.A.,The rainbow's tints could never vie
1959,C.S.A.,With all the colors that they wore;
1960,C.S.A.,While bluer than the bluest sky
1961,C.S.A.,The stream flowed on 'tween shore and shore.
1962,C.S.A.,
1963,C.S.A.,"And on the height, and down the side"
1964,C.S.A.,"Of either hill that hid the place,"
1965,C.S.A.,Rose elms in all the stately pride
1966,C.S.A.,Of youthful strength and ancient race.
1967,C.S.A.,
1968,C.S.A.,While here and there the trees between --
1969,C.S.A.,"Bearing the scars of battle-shocks,"
1970,C.S.A.,And frowning wrathful -- might be seen
1971,C.S.A.,The moss-veiled faces of the rocks.
1972,C.S.A.,
1973,C.S.A.,"And round the rocks crept flowered vines,"
1974,C.S.A.,And clomb the trees that towered high --
1975,C.S.A.,The type of a lofty thought that twines
1976,C.S.A.,Around a truth -- to touch the sky.
1977,C.S.A.,
1978,C.S.A.,"And to that vale, from first of May"
1979,C.S.A.,"Until the last of August went,"
1980,C.S.A.,"Beauty, the exile, came each day"
1981,C.S.A.,"In all her charms, to cast her tent."
1982,C.S.A.,
1983,C.S.A.,"'Twas there, one long-gone August day,"
1984,C.S.A.,I wandered down the valley fair:
1985,C.S.A.,The spell has never passed away
1986,C.S.A.,That fell upon my spirit there.
1987,C.S.A.,
1988,C.S.A.,The summer sunset glorified
1989,C.S.A.,"The clouded face of dying day,"
1990,C.S.A.,Which flung a smile upon the tide
1991,C.S.A.,"And lilies, ere he passed away."
1992,C.S.A.,
1993,C.S.A.,And o'er the valley's grassy slopes
1994,C.S.A.,"There fell an evanescent sheen,"
1995,C.S.A.,"That flashed and faded, like the hopes"
1996,C.S.A.,That haunt us of what might have been.
1997,C.S.A.,
1998,C.S.A.,And rock and tree flung back the light
1999,C.S.A.,"Of all the sunset's golden gems,"
2000,C.S.A.,As if it were beneath their right
2001,C.S.A.,To wear such borrowed diadems.
2002,C.S.A.,
2003,C.S.A.,Low in the west gleam after gleam
2004,C.S.A.,"Glowed faint and fainter, till the last"
2005,C.S.A.,"Made the dying day a living dream,"
2006,C.S.A.,To last as long as life shall last.
2007,C.S.A.,
2008,C.S.A.,And in the arches of the trees
2009,C.S.A.,The wild birds slept with folded wing;
2010,C.S.A.,And e'en the lips of the summer breeze
2011,C.S.A.,"That sang all day, had ceased to sing."
2012,C.S.A.,
2013,C.S.A.,"And all was silent, save the rill"
2014,C.S.A.,"That rippled round the lilies' feet,"
2015,C.S.A.,"And sang, while stillness grew more still"
2016,C.S.A.,To listen to the murmur sweet.
2017,C.S.A.,
2018,C.S.A.,And now and then it surely seemed
2019,C.S.A.,"The little stream was laughing low,"
2020,C.S.A.,As if its sleepy wavelets dreamed
2021,C.S.A.,Such dreams as only children know.
2022,C.S.A.,
2023,C.S.A.,So still that not the faintest breath
2024,C.S.A.,Did stir the shadows in the air;
2025,C.S.A.,"It would have seemed the home of Death,"
2026,C.S.A.,Had I not felt Life sleeping there.
2027,C.S.A.,
2028,C.S.A.,"And slow and soft, and soft and slow,"
2029,C.S.A.,From darkling earth and darkened sky
2030,C.S.A.,"Wide wings of gloom waved to and fro,"
2031,C.S.A.,And spectral shadows flitted by.
2032,C.S.A.,
2033,C.S.A.,"And then, methought, upon the sward"
2034,C.S.A.,I saw -- or was it starlight's ray?
2035,C.S.A.,Or angels come to watch and guard
2036,C.S.A.,The valley till the dawn of day?
2037,C.S.A.,
2038,C.S.A.,Is every lower life the ward
2039,C.S.A.,Of spirits more divinely wrought?
2040,C.S.A.,"'Tis sweet to believe 'tis God's, and hard"
2041,C.S.A.,To think 'tis but a poet's thought.
2042,C.S.A.,
2043,C.S.A.,"But God's or poet's thought, I ween,"
2044,C.S.A.,My senses did not fail me when
2045,C.S.A.,I saw veiled angels watch that scene
2046,C.S.A.,"And guard its sleep, as they guard men."
2047,C.S.A.,
2048,C.S.A.,"Sweet sang the stream as on it pressed,"
2049,C.S.A.,As sorrow sings a heart to sleep;
2050,C.S.A.,"As a mother sings one child to rest,"
2051,C.S.A.,And for the dead one still will weep.
2052,C.S.A.,
2053,C.S.A.,"I walked adown the singing stream,"
2054,C.S.A.,The lilies slept on either side;
2055,C.S.A.,My heart -- it could not help but dream
2056,C.S.A.,"At eve, and after eventide."
2057,C.S.A.,
2058,C.S.A.,Ah! dreams of such a lofty reach
2059,C.S.A.,"With more than earthly fancies fraught,"
2060,C.S.A.,That not the strongest wings of speech
2061,C.S.A.,Could ever touch their lowest thought.
2062,C.S.A.,
2063,C.S.A.,"Dreams of the Bright, the Fair, the Far --"
2064,C.S.A.,Heart-fancies flashing Heaven's hue --
2065,C.S.A.,"That swept around, as sweeps a star"
2066,C.S.A.,The boundless orbit of the True.
2067,C.S.A.,
2068,C.S.A.,"Yea! dreams all free from earthly taint,"
2069,C.S.A.,"Where human passion played no part,"
2070,C.S.A.,"As pure as thoughts that thrill a saint,"
2071,C.S.A.,Or hunt an archangelic heart.
2072,C.S.A.,
2073,C.S.A.,"Ah! dreams that did not rise from sense,"
2074,C.S.A.,"And rose too high to stoop to it,"
2075,C.S.A.,And framed aloft like frankincense
2076,C.S.A.,In censers round the infinite.
2077,C.S.A.,
2078,C.S.A.,Yea! dreams that vied with angels' flight!
2079,C.S.A.,"And, soaring, bore my heart away"
2080,C.S.A.,"Beyond the far star-bounds of night,"
2081,C.S.A.,Unto the everlasting day.
2082,C.S.A.,
2083,C.S.A.,How long I strolled beside the stream
2084,C.S.A.,"I do not know, nor may I say;"
2085,C.S.A.,But when the poet ceased to dream
2086,C.S.A.,The priest went on his knees to pray.
2087,C.S.A.,
2088,C.S.A.,I felt as sure a seraph feels
2089,C.S.A.,When in some golden hour of grace
2090,C.S.A.,"God smiles, and suddenly reveals"
2091,C.S.A.,"A new, strange glory in His face."
2092,C.S.A.,
2093,C.S.A.,Ah! starlit valley!  Lilies white!
2094,C.S.A.,The poet dreamed -- ye slumbered deep!
2095,C.S.A.,But when the priest knelt down that night
2096,C.S.A.,"And prayed, why woke ye from your sleep?"
2097,C.S.A.,
2098,C.S.A.,*    *    *    *    *
2099,C.S.A.,
2100,C.S.A.,"The stream sang down the valley fair,"
2101,C.S.A.,"I saw the wakened lilies nod,"
2102,C.S.A.,"I knew they heard me whisper there,"
2103,C.S.A.,"""How beautiful art Thou, my God!"""
2104,C.S.A.,
2105,C.S.A.,
2106,C.S.A.,
2107,C.S.A.,
2108,C.S.A.,At Last
2109,C.S.A.,
2110,C.S.A.,
2111,C.S.A.,
2112,C.S.A.,"Into a temple vast and dim,"
2113,C.S.A.,"Solemn and vast and dim,"
2114,C.S.A.,Just when the last sweet Vesper Hymn
2115,C.S.A.,"Was floating far away,"
2116,C.S.A.,With eyes that tabernacled tears --
2117,C.S.A.,Her heart the home of tears --
2118,C.S.A.,"And cheeks wan with the woes of years,"
2119,C.S.A.,A woman went one day.
2120,C.S.A.,
2121,C.S.A.,"And, one by one, adown the aisles,"
2122,C.S.A.,"Adown the long, lone aisles,"
2123,C.S.A.,Their faces bright with holy smiles
2124,C.S.A.,"That follow after prayer,"
2125,C.S.A.,"The worshipers in silence passed,"
2126,C.S.A.,In silence slowly passed away;
2127,C.S.A.,The woman knelt until the last
2128,C.S.A.,Had left her lonely there.
2129,C.S.A.,
2130,C.S.A.,"A holy hush came o'er the place,"
2131,C.S.A.,"O'er the holy place,"
2132,C.S.A.,"The shadows kissed her woe-worn face,"
2133,C.S.A.,Her forehead touched the floor;
2134,C.S.A.,The wreck that drifted thro' the years --
2135,C.S.A.,Sin-driven thro' the years --
2136,C.S.A.,"Was floating o'er the tide of tears,"
2137,C.S.A.,To Mercy's golden shore.
2138,C.S.A.,
2139,C.S.A.,"Her lips were sealed, they could not pray,"
2140,C.S.A.,"They sighed, but could not pray,"
2141,C.S.A.,All words of prayer had died away
2142,C.S.A.,From them long years ago;
2143,C.S.A.,But ah! from out her eyes there rose --
2144,C.S.A.,Sad from her eyes there rose --
2145,C.S.A.,"The prayer of tears, which swiftest goes"
2146,C.S.A.,To Heaven -- winged with woe.
2147,C.S.A.,
2148,C.S.A.,"With weary tears, her weary eyes,"
2149,C.S.A.,"Her joyless, weary eyes,"
2150,C.S.A.,Wailed forth a rosary; and her sighs
2151,C.S.A.,And sobs strung all the beads;
2152,C.S.A.,The while before her spirit's gaze --
2153,C.S.A.,Her contrite spirit's gaze --
2154,C.S.A.,"Moved all the mysteries of her days,"
2155,C.S.A.,And histories of her deeds.
2156,C.S.A.,
2157,C.S.A.,"Still as a shadow, while she wept,"
2158,C.S.A.,"So desolately wept,"
2159,C.S.A.,"Up thro' the long, lone aisle she crept"
2160,C.S.A.,Unto an altar fair;
2161,C.S.A.,"""Mother!"" -- her pale lips said no more --"
2162,C.S.A.,Could say no more --
2163,C.S.A.,"The wreck, at last, reached Mercy's shore,"
2164,C.S.A.,For Mary's shrine was there.
2165,C.S.A.,
2166,C.S.A.,
2167,C.S.A.,
2168,C.S.A.,
2169,C.S.A.,A Land without Ruins
2170,C.S.A.,
2171,C.S.A.,"""A land without ruins is a land without memories --"
2172,C.S.A.,a land without memories is a land without history.
2173,C.S.A.,A land that wears a laurel crown may be fair to see;
2174,C.S.A.,"but twine a few sad cypress leaves around the brow of any land,"
2175,C.S.A.,"and be that land barren, beautiless and bleak, it becomes lovely"
2176,C.S.A.,"in its consecrated coronet of sorrow, and it wins the sympathy of the heart"
2177,C.S.A.,and of history.  Crowns of roses fade -- crowns of thorns endure.
2178,C.S.A.,Calvaries and crucifixions take deepest hold of humanity --
2179,C.S.A.,the triumphs of might are transient -- they pass and are forgotten --
2180,C.S.A.,"the sufferings of right are graven deepest on the chronicle of nations."""
2181,C.S.A.,
2182,C.S.A.,
2183,C.S.A.,
2184,C.S.A.,"Yes give me the land where the ruins are spread,"
2185,C.S.A.,And the living tread light on the hearts of the dead;
2186,C.S.A.,"Yes, give me a land that is blest by the dust,"
2187,C.S.A.,And bright with the deeds of the down-trodden just.
2188,C.S.A.,"Yes, give me the land where the battle's red blast"
2189,C.S.A.,Has flashed to the future the fame of the past;
2190,C.S.A.,"Yes, give me the land that hath legends and lays"
2191,C.S.A.,That tell of the memories of long vanished days;
2192,C.S.A.,"Yes, give me a land that hath story and song!"
2193,C.S.A.,Enshrine the strife of the right with the wrong!
2194,C.S.A.,"Yes, give me a land with a grave in each spot,"
2195,C.S.A.,And names in the graves that shall not be forgot;
2196,C.S.A.,"Yes, give me the land of the wreck and the tomb;"
2197,C.S.A.,There is grandeur in graves -- there is glory in gloom;
2198,C.S.A.,"For out of the gloom future brightness is born,"
2199,C.S.A.,As after the night comes the sunrise of morn;
2200,C.S.A.,And the graves of the dead with the grass overgrown
2201,C.S.A.,"May yet form the footstool of liberty's throne,"
2202,C.S.A.,And each single wreck in the war path of might
2203,C.S.A.,Shall yet be a rock in the temple of right.
2204,C.S.A.,
2205,C.S.A.,
2206,C.S.A.,
2207,C.S.A.,
2208,C.S.A.,Memories
2209,C.S.A.,
2210,C.S.A.,
2211,C.S.A.,
2212,C.S.A.,"They come, as the breeze comes over the foam,"
2213,C.S.A.,Waking the waves that are sinking to sleep --
2214,C.S.A.,"The fairest of memories from far-away home,"
2215,C.S.A.,The dim dreams of faces beyond the dark deep.
2216,C.S.A.,
2217,C.S.A.,"They come as the stars come out in the sky,"
2218,C.S.A.,"That shimmer wherever the shadows may sweep,"
2219,C.S.A.,And their steps are as soft as the sound of a sigh
2220,C.S.A.,And I welcome them all while I wearily weep.
2221,C.S.A.,
2222,C.S.A.,They come as a song comes out of the past
2223,C.S.A.,"A loved mother murmured in days that are dead,"
2224,C.S.A.,"Whose tones spirit-thrilling live on to the last,"
2225,C.S.A.,When the gloom of the heart wraps its gray o'er the head.
2226,C.S.A.,
2227,C.S.A.,"They come like the ghosts from the grass shrouded graves,"
2228,C.S.A.,And they follow our footsteps on life's winding way;
2229,C.S.A.,And they murmur around us as murmur the waves
2230,C.S.A.,That sigh on the shore at the dying of day.
2231,C.S.A.,
2232,C.S.A.,"They come, sad as tears to the eyes that are bright;"
2233,C.S.A.,"They come, sweet as smiles to the lips that are pale;"
2234,C.S.A.,"They come, dim as dreams in the depths of the night;"
2235,C.S.A.,"They come, fair as flowers to the summerless vale."
2236,C.S.A.,
2237,C.S.A.,"There is not a heart that is not haunted so,"
2238,C.S.A.,"Though far we may stray from the scenes of the past,"
2239,C.S.A.,"Its memories will follow wherever we go,"
2240,C.S.A.,And the days that were first sway the days that are last.
2241,C.S.A.,
2242,C.S.A.,
2243,C.S.A.,
2244,C.S.A.,
2245,C.S.A.,The Prayer of the South
2246,C.S.A.,
2247,C.S.A.,
2248,C.S.A.,
2249,C.S.A.,My brow is bent beneath a heavy rod!
2250,C.S.A.,My face is wan and white with many woes!
2251,C.S.A.,"But I will lift my poor chained hands to God,"
2252,C.S.A.,"And for my children pray, and for my foes."
2253,C.S.A.,Beside the graves where thousands lowly lie
2254,C.S.A.,"I kneel, and weeping for each slaughtered son,"
2255,C.S.A.,"I turn my gaze to my own sunny sky,"
2256,C.S.A.,"And pray, O Father, let Thy will be done!"
2257,C.S.A.,
2258,C.S.A.,"My heart is filled with anguish, deep and vast!"
2259,C.S.A.,My hopes are buried with my children's dust!
2260,C.S.A.,"My joys have fled, my tears are flowing fast!"
2261,C.S.A.,"In whom, save Thee, our Father, shall I trust?"
2262,C.S.A.,"Ah! I forgot Thee, Father, long and oft,"
2263,C.S.A.,"When I was happy, rich, and proud, and free;"
2264,C.S.A.,"But conquered now, and crushed, I look aloft,"
2265,C.S.A.,"And sorrow leads me, Father, back to Thee."
2266,C.S.A.,
2267,C.S.A.,Amid the wrecks that mark the foeman's path
2268,C.S.A.,"I kneel, and wailing o'er my glories gone,"
2269,C.S.A.,"I still each thought of hate, each throb of wrath,"
2270,C.S.A.,"And whisper, Father, let Thy will be done!"
2271,C.S.A.,"Pity me, Father of the desolate!"
2272,C.S.A.,Alas! my burdens are so hard to bear;
2273,C.S.A.,"Look down in mercy on my wretched fate,"
2274,C.S.A.,"And keep me, guard me, with Thy loving care."
2275,C.S.A.,
2276,C.S.A.,"Pity me, Father, for His holy sake,"
2277,C.S.A.,"Whose broken heart bled at the feet of grief,"
2278,C.S.A.,"That hearts of earth, whenever they shall break,"
2279,C.S.A.,Might go to His and find a sure relief.
2280,C.S.A.,"Ah, me, how dark!  Is this a brief eclipse?"
2281,C.S.A.,Or is it night with no to-morrow's sun?
2282,C.S.A.,"O Father! Father! with my pale, sad lips,"
2283,C.S.A.,"And sadder heart, I pray Thy will be done."
2284,C.S.A.,
2285,C.S.A.,"My homes are joyless, and a million mourn"
2286,C.S.A.,Where many met in joys forever flown;
2287,C.S.A.,"Whose hearts were light, are burdened now and torn,"
2288,C.S.A.,"Where many smiled, but one is left to moan."
2289,C.S.A.,"And ah! the widow's wails, the orphan's cries,"
2290,C.S.A.,Are morning hymn and vesper chant to me;
2291,C.S.A.,And groans of men and sounds of women's sighs
2292,C.S.A.,"Commingle, Father, with my prayer to Thee."
2293,C.S.A.,
2294,C.S.A.,Beneath my feet ten thousand children dead --
2295,C.S.A.,Oh! how I loved each known and nameless one!
2296,C.S.A.,Above their dust I bow my crownless head
2297,C.S.A.,"And murmur:  Father, still Thy will be done."
2298,C.S.A.,"Ah! Father, Thou didst deck my own loved land"
2299,C.S.A.,"With all bright charms, and beautiful and fair;"
2300,C.S.A.,"But foeman came, and with a ruthless hand,"
2301,C.S.A.,"Spread ruin, wreck, and desolation there."
2302,C.S.A.,
2303,C.S.A.,"Girdled with gloom, of all my brightness shorn,"
2304,C.S.A.,"And garmented with grief, I kiss Thy rod,"
2305,C.S.A.,"And turn my face, with tears all wet and worn,"
2306,C.S.A.,To catch one smile of pity from my God.
2307,C.S.A.,"Around me blight, where all before was bloom,"
2308,C.S.A.,"And so much lost, alas! and nothing won"
2309,C.S.A.,Save this -- that I can lean on wreck and tomb
2310,C.S.A.,"And weep, and weeping, pray Thy will be done."
2311,C.S.A.,
2312,C.S.A.,"And oh! 'tis hard to say, but said, 'tis sweet;"
2313,C.S.A.,"The words are bitter, but they hold a balm --"
2314,C.S.A.,"A balm that heals the wounds of my defeat,"
2315,C.S.A.,And lulls my sorrow into holy calm.
2316,C.S.A.,"It is the prayer of prayers, and how it brings,"

3107,S. M. A.,I Often Wonder Why 'Tis So
3108,S. M. A.,
3109,S. M. A.,
3110,S. M. A.,
3111,S. M. A.,"Some find work where some find rest,"
3112,S. M. A.,And so the weary world goes on:
3113,S. M. A.,I sometimes wonder which is best;
3114,S. M. A.,The answer comes when life is gone.
3115,S. M. A.,
3116,S. M. A.,"Some eyes sleep when some eyes wake,"
3117,S. M. A.,And so the dreary night-hours go;
3118,S. M. A.,Some hearts beat where some hearts break;
3119,S. M. A.,I often wonder why 'tis so.
3120,S. M. A.,
3121,S. M. A.,"Some wills faint where some wills fight,"
3122,S. M. A.,"Some love the tent, and some the field;"
3123,S. M. A.,I often wonder who are right --
3124,S. M. A.,"The ones who strive, or those who yield?"
3125,S. M. A.,
3126,S. M. A.,Some hands fold where other hands
3127,S. M. A.,Are lifted bravely in the strife;
3128,S. M. A.,And so thro' ages and thro' lands
3129,S. M. A.,Move on the two extremes of life.
3130,S. M. A.,
3131,S. M. A.,"Some feet halt where some feet tread,"
3132,S. M. A.,"In tireless march, a thorny way;"
3133,S. M. A.,Some struggle on where some have fled;

3135,S. M. A.,
3136,S. M. A.,"Some swords rust where others clash,"
3137,S. M. A.,Some fall back where some move on;
3138,S. M. A.,Some flags furl where others flash
3139,S. M. A.,Until the battle has been won.
3140,S. M. A.,
3141,S. M. A.,Some sleep on while others keep
3142,S. M. A.,The vigils of the true and brave:
3143,S. M. A.,They will not rest till roses creep
3144,S. M. A.,Around their name above a grave.

3179,S. M. A.,Thee to me and me to thee.
3180,S. M. A.,
3181,S. M. A.,For I make my heart the home
3182,S. M. A.,Of all hearts in grief that come
3183,S. M. A.,Seeking refuge and a rest.
3184,S. M. A.,"Do not fear me, for you know,"
3185,S. M. A.,"Be your footsteps e'er so low,"
3186,S. M. A.,"I know yours, of all, the best."
3187,S. M. A.,
3188,S. M. A.,Once you came; and you brought sin;
3189,S. M. A.,Did not my hand lead you in --
3190,S. M. A.,"Into God's heart, thro' my own?"
3191,S. M. A.,Did not my voice speak a word
3192,S. M. A.,"You, for years, had never heard --"
3193,S. M. A.,Mystic word in Mercy's tone?
3194,S. M. A.,
3195,S. M. A.,"And a grace fell on your brow,"
3196,S. M. A.,"And I heard your murmured vow,"
3197,S. M. A.,"When I whispered:  ""Go in peace."""
3198,S. M. A.,"""Go in peace, and sin no more,"""
3199,S. M. A.,"Did you not touch Mercy's shore,"

3209,S. M. A.,Yes! I bless you -- near or far --
3210,S. M. A.,"And my blessing, like a star,"
3211,S. M. A.,Shall shine on you everywhere;

3222,S. M. A.,
3223,S. M. A.,Between two pillared clouds of gold
3224,S. M. A.,The beautiful gates of evening swung --
3225,S. M. A.,And far and wide from flashing fold
3226,S. M. A.,"The half-furled banners of light, that hung"
3227,S. M. A.,O'er green of wood and gray of wold
3228,S. M. A.,"And over the blue where the river rolled,"
3229,S. M. A.,The fading gleams of their glory flung.
3230,S. M. A.,
3231,S. M. A.,The sky wore not a frown all day
3232,S. M. A.,To mar the smile of the morning tide;
3233,S. M. A.,The soft-voiced winds sang joyous lay --
3234,S. M. A.,You never would think they had ever sighed;
3235,S. M. A.,The stream went on its sunlit way
3236,S. M. A.,In ripples of laughter; happy they
3237,S. M. A.,As the hearts that met at Riverside.
3238,S. M. A.,
3239,S. M. A.,No cloudlet in the sky serene!
3240,S. M. A.,Not a silver speck in the golden hue!
3241,S. M. A.,"But where the woods waved low and green,"
3242,S. M. A.,"And seldom would let the sunlight through,"
3243,S. M. A.,"Sweet shadows fell, and in their screen,"
3244,S. M. A.,"The faces of children might be seen,"
3245,S. M. A.,And the flash of ribbons of blue.
3246,S. M. A.,
3247,S. M. A.,"It was a children's simple feast,"
3248,S. M. A.,Yet many were there whose faces told
3249,S. M. A.,How far they are from childhood's East
3250,S. M. A.,Who have reached the evening of the old!
3251,S. M. A.,And father -- mother -- sister -- priest --
3252,S. M. A.,They seemed all day like the very least
3253,S. M. A.,Of the little children of the fold.
3254,S. M. A.,
3255,S. M. A.,"The old forgot they were not young,"
3256,S. M. A.,"The young forgot they would e'er be old,"

3258,S. M. A.,"Where'er their footsteps stayed or strolled,"
3259,S. M. A.,"Came wittiest word from tireless tongue,"
3260,S. M. A.,And the merriest peals of laughter rung
3261,S. M. A.,Where the woods drooped low and the river rolled.
3262,S. M. A.,
3263,S. M. A.,"No cloud upon the faces there,"
3264,S. M. A.,Not a sorrow came from its hiding place

3266,S. M. A.,"On the fair, sweet brows in that fairest place"
3267,S. M. A.,"For in the sky and in the air,"

3270,S. M. A.,
3271,S. M. A.,"The day was long, but ah! too brief!"
3272,S. M. A.,Swift to the West bright-winged she fled;
3273,S. M. A.,Too soon on ev'ry look and leaf
3274,S. M. A.,The last rays flushed which her plumage shed
3275,S. M. A.,From an evening cloud -- was it a sign of grief?
3276,S. M. A.,And the bright day passed -- is there much relief
3277,S. M. A.,That its dream dies not when its gleam is dead?
3278,S. M. A.,
3279,S. M. A.,"Great sky, thou art a prophet still!"

3291,S. M. A.,"The selfsame woods will wave as green,"
3292,S. M. A.,"And Riverside, thy skies serene"

3294,S. M. A.,Yet though thy shadows may weave a screen
3295,S. M. A.,"Where the children's faces may be seen,"

3442,S. M. A.,
3443,S. M. A.,"And his pulse faint, fainter beating"
3444,S. M. A.,Told his hours were few and fleeting;
3445,S. M. A.,"And his brow grew white and whiter,"
3446,S. M. A.,While his eyes grew strangely brighter;
3447,S. M. A.,"There he lay -- like infant dreaming,"
3448,S. M. A.,"With his sword beside him gleaming,"
3449,S. M. A.,"For the hand in life that grasped it,"
3450,S. M. A.,True in death still fondly clasped it;
3451,S. M. A.,There his comrades found him lying
3452,S. M. A.,"'Mid the heaps of dead and dying,"
3453,S. M. A.,And the sternest bent down weeping
3454,S. M. A.,O'er the lonely sleeper sleeping:
3455,S. M. A.,"'Twas the midnight; stars shone round him,"
3456,S. M. A.,And they told us how they found him
3457,S. M. A.,Where the bravest love to fall.
3458,S. M. A.,
3459,S. M. A.,"Where the woods, like banners bending,"
3460,S. M. A.,"Drooped in starlight and in gloom,"
3461,S. M. A.,"There, when that sad night was ending,"
3462,S. M. A.,"And the faint, far dawn was blending"

3464,S. M. A.,"There they mute and mournful bore him,"
3465,S. M. A.,"With the stars and shadows o'er him,"

3484,S. M. A.,"I bowed in awe, and I listened --"

3491,S. M. A.,"A word that is whispered in heaven,"

4286,S. M. A.,Its bard has not come yet.
4287,S. M. A.,His sun through one of to-morrow's gates
4288,S. M. A.,"Shall shine, but never set."
4289,S. M. A.,
4290,S. M. A.,But when he comes he'll sweep
4291,S. M. A.,"A harp with tears all stringed,"
4292,S. M. A.,And the very notes he strikes will weep
4293,S. M. A.,As they come from his hand woe-winged.
4294,S. M. A.,
4295,S. M. A.,"Ah! grand shall be his strain,"
4296,S. M. A.,"And his songs shall fill all climes,"
4297,S. M. A.,And the rebels shall rise and march again
4298,S. M. A.,Down the lines of his glorious rhymes.
4299,S. M. A.,
4300,S. M. A.,And through his verse shall gleam
4301,S. M. A.,"The swords that flashed in vain,"
4302,S. M. A.,And the men who wore the gray shall seem
4303,S. M. A.,To be marshaling again.
4304,S. M. A.,
4305,S. M. A.,But hush! between his words
4306,S. M. A.,"Peer faces sad and pale,"
4307,S. M. A.,And you hear the sound of broken chords
4308,S. M. A.,Beat through the poet's wail.
4309,S. M. A.,
4310,S. M. A.,Through his verse the orphans cry --
4311,S. M. A.,The terrible undertone --
4312,S. M. A.,"And the father's curse and the mother's sigh,"
4313,S. M. A.,And the desolate young wife's moan.

4315,S. M. A.,*    *    *    *    *
4316,S. M. A.,
4317,S. M. A.,But harps are in every land
4318,S. M. A.,"That await a voice that sings,"
4319,S. M. A.,And a master-hand -- but the humblest hand
4320,S. M. A.,May gently touch its strings.
4321,S. M. A.,
4322,S. M. A.,I sing with a voice too low
4323,S. M. A.,"To be heard beyond to-day,"
4324,S. M. A.,"In minor keys of my people's woe,"
4325,S. M. A.,But my songs pass away.
4326,S. M. A.,
4327,S. M. A.,To-morrow hears them not --
4328,S. M. A.,To-morrow belongs to Fame --
4329,S. M. A.,"My songs, like the birds', will be forgot,"
4330,S. M. A.,And forgotten shall be my name.
4331,S. M. A.,
4332,S. M. A.,And yet who knows?  Betimes
4333,S. M. A.,"The grandest songs depart,"
4334,S. M. A.,"While the gentle, humble, and low-toned rhymes"
4335,S. M. A.,Will echo from heart to heart.
4336,S. M. A.,
4337,S. M. A.,"But, oh! if in song or speech,"
4338,S. M. A.,"In major or minor key,"
4339,S. M. A.,"My voice could over the ages reach,"
4340,S. M. A.,I would whisper the name of Lee.
4341,S. M. A.,
4342,S. M. A.,In the night of our defeat
4343,S. M. A.,"Star after star had gone,"
4344,S. M. A.,But the way was bright to our soldiers' feet
4345,S. M. A.,Where the star of Lee led on.
4346,S. M. A.,
4347,S. M. A.,"But sudden there came a cloud,"
4348,S. M. A.,Out rung a nation's knell;
4349,S. M. A.,"Our cause was wrapped in its winding shroud,"
4350,S. M. A.,All fell when the great Lee fell.
4351,S. M. A.,
4352,S. M. A.,"From his men, with scarce a word,"
4353,S. M. A.,Silence when great hearts part!
4354,S. M. A.,But we know he sheathed his stainless sword
4355,S. M. A.,In the wound of a broken heart.
4356,S. M. A.,
4357,S. M. A.,He fled from Fame; but Fame
4358,S. M. A.,"Sought him in his retreat,"
4359,S. M. A.,Demanding for the world one name
4360,S. M. A.,Made deathless by defeat.
4361,S. M. A.,
4362,S. M. A.,"Nay, Fame! success is best!"
4363,S. M. A.,All lost! and nothing won:
4364,S. M. A.,"North, keep the clouds that flush the West,"
4365,S. M. A.,We have the sinking sun.
4366,S. M. A.,
4367,S. M. A.,All lost! but by the graves
4368,S. M. A.,"Where martyred heroes rest,"
4369,S. M. A.,He wins the most who honor saves --
4370,S. M. A.,Success is not the test.
4371,S. M. A.,
4372,S. M. A.,All lost! a nation weeps;
4373,S. M. A.,"By all the tears that fall,"
4374,S. M. A.,"He loses naught who conscience keeps,"
4375,S. M. A.,Lee's honor saves us all.
4376,S. M. A.,
4377,S. M. A.,All lost! but e'en defeat
4378,S. M. A.,"Hath triumphs of her own,"
4379,S. M. A.,Wrong's paean hath no note so sweet
4380,S. M. A.,As trampled Right's proud moan.
4381,S. M. A.,
4382,S. M. A.,"The world shall yet decide,"
4383,S. M. A.,"In truth's clear, far-off light,"
4384,S. M. A.,"That the soldiers who wore the gray, and died"
4385,S. M. A.,"With Lee, were in the right."
4386,S. M. A.,
4387,S. M. A.,"And men, by time made wise,"
4388,S. M. A.,Shall in the future see
4389,S. M. A.,"No name hath risen, or ever shall rise,"
4390,S. M. A.,Like the name of Robert Lee.
4391,S. M. A.,
4392,S. M. A.,"Ah, me! my words are weak,"
4393,S. M. A.,This task surpasses me;
4394,S. M. A.,"Dead soldiers! rise from your graves and speak,"
4395,S. M. A.,And tell how you loved Lee.
4396,S. M. A.,
4397,S. M. A.,"The banner you bore is furled,"
4398,S. M. A.,"And the gray is faded, too!"
4399,S. M. A.,But in all the colors that deck the world
4400,S. M. A.,Your gray blends not with blue.
4401,S. M. A.,
4402,S. M. A.,"The colors are far apart,"
4403,S. M. A.,Graves sever them in twain;
4404,S. M. A.,The Northern heart and the Southern heart
4405,S. M. A.,May beat in peace again;
4406,S. M. A.,
4407,S. M. A.,"But still till time's last day,"
4408,S. M. A.,"Whatever lips may plight,"
4409,S. M. A.,"The blue is blue, but the gray is gray,"

4417,S. M. A.,Go! with your bright emblazoned scroll
4418,S. M. A.,"And tell the years to be,"
4419,S. M. A.,The first of names that flash your roll
4420,S. M. A.,Is ours -- great Robert Lee.
4421,S. M. A.,
4422,S. M. A.,Lee wore the gray! since then
4423,S. M. A.,'Tis Right's and Honor's hue!
4424,S. M. A.,"He honored it, that man of men,"
4425,S. M. A.,And wrapped it round the true.
4426,S. M. A.,
4427,S. M. A.,Dead! but his spirit breathes!
4428,S. M. A.,Dead! but his heart is ours!
4429,S. M. A.,Dead! but his sunny and sad land wreathes
4430,S. M. A.,His crown with tears for flowers.
4431,S. M. A.,
4432,S. M. A.,A statue for his tomb!
4433,S. M. A.,Mould it of marble white!
4434,S. M. A.,"For Wrong, a spectre of death and doom;"
4435,S. M. A.,An angel of hope for Right.
4436,S. M. A.,
4437,S. M. A.,But Lee has a thousand graves
4438,S. M. A.,"In a thousand hearts, I ween;"
4439,S. M. A.,And teardrops fall from our eyes in waves
4440,S. M. A.,That will keep his memory green.
4441,S. M. A.,

4455,S. M. A.,
4456,S. M. A.,A Mystery
4457,S. M. A.,
4458,S. M. A.,His face was sad; some shadow must have hung
4459,S. M. A.,"Above his soul; its folds, now falling dark,"
4460,S. M. A.,"Now almost bright; but dark or not so dark,"
4461,S. M. A.,"Like cloud upon a mount, 'twas always there --"
4462,S. M. A.,A shadow; and his face was always sad.
4463,S. M. A.,
4464,S. M. A.,His eyes were changeful; for the gloom of gray
4465,S. M. A.,"Within them met and blended with the blue,"
4466,S. M. A.,And when they gazed they seemed almost to dream
4467,S. M. A.,"They looked beyond you into far-away,"
4468,S. M. A.,And often drooped; his face was always sad.
4469,S. M. A.,
4470,S. M. A.,"His eyes were deep; I often saw them dim,"
4471,S. M. A.,As if the edges of a cloud of tears
4472,S. M. A.,"Had gathered there, and only left a mist"
4473,S. M. A.,That made them moist and kept them ever moist.
4474,S. M. A.,He never wept; his face was always sad.
4475,S. M. A.,
4476,S. M. A.,"I mean, not many saw him ever weep,"
4477,S. M. A.,"And yet he seemed as one who often wept,"
4478,S. M. A.,"Or always, tears that were too proud to flow"
4479,S. M. A.,"In outer streams, but shrunk within and froze --"
4480,S. M. A.,Froze down into himself; his face was sad.
4481,S. M. A.,
4482,S. M. A.,"And yet sometimes he smiled -- a sudden smile,"
4483,S. M. A.,"As if some far-gone joy came back again,"
4484,S. M. A.,"Surprised his heart, and flashed across his face"
4485,S. M. A.,"A moment like a light through rifts in clouds,"
4486,S. M. A.,Which falls upon an unforgotten grave;
4487,S. M. A.,He rarely laughed; his face was ever sad.
4488,S. M. A.,
4489,S. M. A.,"And when he spoke his words were sad as wails,"
4490,S. M. A.,"And strange as stories of an unknown land,"
4491,S. M. A.,And full of meanings as the sea of moans.
4492,S. M. A.,At times he was so still that silence seemed
4493,S. M. A.,To sentinel his lips; and not a word
4494,S. M. A.,Would leave his heart; his face was strangely sad.
4495,S. M. A.,
4496,S. M. A.,But then at times his speech flowed like a stream --
4497,S. M. A.,A deep and dreamy stream through lonely dells
4498,S. M. A.,"Of lofty mountain-thoughts, and o'er its waves"
4499,S. M. A.,Hung mysteries of gloom; and in its flow
4500,S. M. A.,"It rippled on lone shores fair-fringed with flowers,"
4501,S. M. A.,And deepened as it flowed; his face was sad.
4502,S. M. A.,
4503,S. M. A.,He had his moods of silence and of speech.
4504,S. M. A.,"I asked him once the reason, and he said:"
4505,S. M. A.,"""When I speak much, my words are only words,"
4506,S. M. A.,"When I speak least, my words are more than words,"
4507,S. M. A.,"When I speak not, I then reveal myself!"""
4508,S. M. A.,It was his way of saying things -- he spoke
4509,S. M. A.,In quaintest riddles; and his face was sad.
4510,S. M. A.,
4511,S. M. A.,"And, when he wished, he wove around his words"
4512,S. M. A.,A nameless spell that marvelously thrilled
4513,S. M. A.,The dullest ear.  'Twas strange that he so cold
4514,S. M. A.,Could warm the coldest heart; that he so hard
4515,S. M. A.,Could soften hardest soul; that he so still
4516,S. M. A.,Could rouse the stillest mind:  his face was sad.
4517,S. M. A.,
4518,S. M. A.,He spoke of death as if it were a toy
4519,S. M. A.,For thought to play with; and of life he spoke
4520,S. M. A.,As of a toy not worth the play of thought;
4521,S. M. A.,And of this world he spoke as captives speak
4522,S. M. A.,Of prisons where they pine; he spoke of men
4523,S. M. A.,As one who found pure gold in each of them.
4524,S. M. A.,He spoke of women just as if he dreamed
4525,S. M. A.,About his mother; and he spoke of God
4526,S. M. A.,As if he walked with Him and knew His heart --
4527,S. M. A.,"But he was weary, and his face was sad."
4528,S. M. A.,
4529,S. M. A.,"He had a weary way in all he did,"
4530,S. M. A.,"As if he dragged a chain, or bore a cross;"
4531,S. M. A.,And yet the weary went to him for rest.
4532,S. M. A.,"His heart seemed scarce to know an earthly joy,"
4533,S. M. A.,And yet the joyless were rejoiced by him.
4534,S. M. A.,He seemed to have two selves -- his outer self
4535,S. M. A.,"Was free to any passer-by, and kind to all,"
4536,S. M. A.,And gentle as a child's; that outer self
4537,S. M. A.,"Kept open all its gates, that who so wished"
4538,S. M. A.,Might enter them and find therein a place;
4539,S. M. A.,And many entered; but his face was sad.
4540,S. M. A.,
4541,S. M. A.,"The inner self he guarded from approach,"
4542,S. M. A.,He kept it sealed and sacred as a shrine;
4543,S. M. A.,He guarded it with silence and reserve;
4544,S. M. A.,"Its gates were locked and watched, and none might pass"
4545,S. M. A.,Beyond the portals; and his face was sad.
4546,S. M. A.,But whoso entered there -- and few were they --
4547,S. M. A.,"So very few -- so very, very few,"
4548,S. M. A.,"They never did forget; they said:  ""How strange!"""
4549,S. M. A.,"They murmured still:  ""How strange! how strangely strange!"""
4550,S. M. A.,"They went their ways, but wore a lifted look,"
4551,S. M. A.,"And higher meanings came to common words,"
4552,S. M. A.,And lowly thoughts took on the grandest tones;
4553,S. M. A.,"And, near or far, they never did forget"
4554,S. M. A.,"The ""Shadow and the Shrine""; his face was sad."
4555,S. M. A.,
4556,S. M. A.,He was not young nor old -- yet he was both;
4557,S. M. A.,"Nor both by turns, but always both at once;"
4558,S. M. A.,"For youth and age commingled in his ways,"
4559,S. M. A.,"His words, his feelings, and his thoughts and acts."
4560,S. M. A.,"At times the ""old man"" tottered in his thoughts,"
4561,S. M. A.,The child played thro' his words; his face was sad.
4562,S. M. A.,
4563,S. M. A.,I one day asked his age; he smiled and said:
4564,S. M. A.,"""The rose that sleeps upon yon valley's breast,"
4565,S. M. A.,"Just born to-day, is not as young as I;"
4566,S. M. A.,The moss-robed oak of twice a thousand storms --
4567,S. M. A.,An acorn cradled ages long ago --
4568,S. M. A.,"Is old, in sooth, but not as old as I."""
4569,S. M. A.,"It was his way -- he always answered thus,"
4570,S. M. A.,But when he did his face was very sad.

4671,S. M. A.,"Passed slowly from him, and his look, so mild,"
4672,S. M. A.,Grew marble cold; a pallor as of death
4673,S. M. A.,"Whitened his lips, and clouds rose to his eyes,"
4674,S. M. A.,"Dry, rainless clouds, where lightnings seemed to sleep."
4675,S. M. A.,"His words, as tender as a rose's smile,"
4676,S. M. A.,"Slow-hardened into thorns, but seemed to sting"
4677,S. M. A.,"Himself the most; his brow, at such times, bent"
4678,S. M. A.,"Most lowly down, and wore such look of pain"
4679,S. M. A.,As though it bore an unseen crown of thorns.
4680,S. M. A.,Who knows? perhaps it did!
4681,S. M. A.,
4682,S. M. A.,But he would pass
4683,S. M. A.,"His hand upon his brow, or touch his eyes,"
4684,S. M. A.,"And then the olden gentleness, like light"
4685,S. M. A.,"Which seems transfigured by the touch of dark,"
4686,S. M. A.,"Would tremble on his face, and he would look"
4687,S. M. A.,"More gentle then than ever, and his tone"
4688,S. M. A.,"Would sweeten, like the winds when storms have passed."
4689,S. M. A.,
4690,S. M. A.,"I saw him, one day, thus most deeply moved"
4691,S. M. A.,And darkened; ah! his face was like a tomb
4692,S. M. A.,"That hid the dust of dead and buried smiles,"
4693,S. M. A.,"But, suddenly, his face flashed like a throne,"
4694,S. M. A.,"And all the smiles arose as from the dead,"
4695,S. M. A.,And wore the glory of an Easter morn;
4696,S. M. A.,And passed beneath the sceptre of a hope
4697,S. M. A.,"Which came from some far region of his heart,"
4698,S. M. A.,"Came up into his eyes, and reigned a queen."
4699,S. M. A.,I marveled much; he answered to my look
4700,S. M. A.,"With all his own, and wafted me these words:"
4701,S. M. A.,
4702,S. M. A.,"""There are transitions in the lives of all."
4703,S. M. A.,There are transcendent moments when we stand
4704,S. M. A.,"In Thabor's glory with the chosen three,"
4705,S. M. A.,And weak with very strength of human love
4706,S. M. A.,We fain would build our tabernacles there;
4707,S. M. A.,"And, Peter-like, for very human joy"
4708,S. M. A.,We cry aloud:  `'Tis good that we are here;'
4709,S. M. A.,"Swift are these moments, like the smile of God,"
4710,S. M. A.,Which glorifies a shadow and is gone.
4711,S. M. A.,
4712,S. M. A.,"""And then we stand upon another mount --"
4713,S. M. A.,"Dark, rugged Calvary; and God keeps us there"
4714,S. M. A.,"For awful hours, to make us there His own"
4715,S. M. A.,In Crucifixion's tortures; 'tis His way.
4716,S. M. A.,We wish to cling to Thabor; He says:  `No.'
4717,S. M. A.,And what He says is best because most true.
4718,S. M. A.,We fain would fly from Calvary; He says:  `No.'
4719,S. M. A.,And it is true because it is the best.
4720,S. M. A.,"And yet, my friend, these two mounts are the same."
4721,S. M. A.,
4722,S. M. A.,"""They lie apart, distinct and separate,"
4723,S. M. A.,And yet -- strange mystery! -- they are the same.
4724,S. M. A.,"For Calvary is a Thabor in the dark,"
4725,S. M. A.,And Thabor is a Calvary in the light.
4726,S. M. A.,It is the mystery of Holy Christ!
4727,S. M. A.,It is the mystery of you and me!
4728,S. M. A.,"Earth's shadows move, as moves far-heaven's sun,"
4729,S. M. A.,"And, like the shadows of a dial, we"
4730,S. M. A.,"Tell, darkly, in the vale the very hours"
4731,S. M. A.,The sun tells brightly in the sinless skies.
4732,S. M. A.,"Dost understand?""  I did not understand --"
4733,S. M. A.,Or only half; his face was very sad.
4734,S. M. A.,"""Dost thou not understand me?  Then your life"
4735,S. M. A.,Is shallow as a brook that brawls along
4736,S. M. A.,Between two narrow shores; you never wept --
4737,S. M. A.,You never wore great clouds upon your brow
4738,S. M. A.,As mountains wear them; and you never wore
4739,S. M. A.,"Strange glories in your eyes, as sunset skies"
4740,S. M. A.,Oft wear them; and your lips -- they never sighed
4741,S. M. A.,Grand sighs which bear the weight of all the soul;
4742,S. M. A.,You never reached your arms a-broad -- a-high --
4743,S. M. A.,"To grasp far-worlds, or to enclasp the sky."
4744,S. M. A.,"Life, only life, can understand a life;"
4745,S. M. A.,"Depth, only depth, can understand the deep."
4746,S. M. A.,The dewdrop glist'ning on the lily's face
4747,S. M. A.,"Can never learn the story of the sea."""

4751,S. M. A.,One day we strolled together to the sea.
4752,S. M. A.,"Gray evening and the night had almost met,"
4753,S. M. A.,"We walked between them, silent, to the shore."
4754,S. M. A.,The feet of weird faced waves ran up the beach
4755,S. M. A.,"Like children in mad play, then back again"
4756,S. M. A.,As if the spirit of the land pursued;
4757,S. M. A.,Then up again -- and farther -- and they flung
4758,S. M. A.,"White, foamy arms around each other's neck;"
4759,S. M. A.,"Then back again with sudden rush and shout,"
4760,S. M. A.,"As if the sea, their mother, called them home;"
4761,S. M. A.,"Then leaned upon her breast, as if so tired,"
4762,S. M. A.,But swiftly tore themselves away and rushed
4763,S. M. A.,"Away, and farther up the beach, and fell"
4764,S. M. A.,For utter weariness; and loudly sobbed
4765,S. M. A.,For strength to rise and flow back to the deep.
4766,S. M. A.,"But all in vain, for other waves swept on"
4767,S. M. A.,"And trampled them; the sea cried out in grief,"
4768,S. M. A.,The gray beach laughed and clasped them to the sands.
4769,S. M. A.,It was the flood-tide and the even-tide --
4770,S. M. A.,Between the evening and the night we walked --
4771,S. M. A.,"We walked between the billows and the beach,"
4772,S. M. A.,"We walked between the future and the past,"
4773,S. M. A.,Down to the sea we twain had strolled -- to part.
4774,S. M. A.,
4775,S. M. A.,"The shore was low, with just the faintest rise"
4776,S. M. A.,"Of many-colored sands and shreds of shells,"
4777,S. M. A.,Until about a stone's far throw they met
4778,S. M. A.,"A fringe of faded grass, with here and there"
4779,S. M. A.,A pale-green shrub; and farther into land --
4780,S. M. A.,Another stone's throw farther -- there were trees --
4781,S. M. A.,"Tall, dark, wild trees, with intertwining arms,"
4782,S. M. A.,"Each almost touching each, as if they feared"
4783,S. M. A.,To stand alone and look upon the sea.
4784,S. M. A.,The night was in the trees -- the evening on the shore.
4785,S. M. A.,We walked between the evening and the night --
4786,S. M. A.,Between the trees and tide we silent strolled.
4787,S. M. A.,There lies between man's silence and his speech
4788,S. M. A.,"A shadowy valley, where thro' those who pass"
4789,S. M. A.,"Are never silent, tho' they may not speak;"
4790,S. M. A.,And yet they more than breathe.  It is the vale
4791,S. M. A.,"Of wordless sighs, half uttered and half-heard."
4792,S. M. A.,It is the vale of the unutterable.
4793,S. M. A.,"We walked between our silence and our speech,"
4794,S. M. A.,"And sighed between the sunset and the stars,"
4795,S. M. A.,One hour beside the sea.
4796,S. M. A.,
4797,S. M. A.,There was a cloud
4798,S. M. A.,"Far o'er the reach of waters, hanging low"
4799,S. M. A.,"'Tween sea and sky -- the banner of the storm,"
4800,S. M. A.,"Its edges faintly bright, as if the rays"
4801,S. M. A.,That fled far down the West had rested there
4802,S. M. A.,"And slumbered, and had left a dream of light."
4803,S. M. A.,"Its inner folds were dark -- its central, more."
4804,S. M. A.,"It did not flutter; there it hung, as calm"
4805,S. M. A.,As banner in a temple o'er a shrine.
4806,S. M. A.,"Its shadow only fell upon the sea,"
4807,S. M. A.,Above the shore the heavens bended blue.
4808,S. M. A.,"We walked between the cloudless and the cloud,"
4809,S. M. A.,"That hour, beside the sea."
4810,S. M. A.,
4811,S. M. A.,"But, quick as thought,"
4812,S. M. A.,"There gleamed a sword of wild, terrific light --"
4813,S. M. A.,"Its hilt in heaven, its point hissed in the sea,"
4814,S. M. A.,Its scabbard in the darkness -- and it tore
4815,S. M. A.,"The bannered cloud into a thousand shreds,"
4816,S. M. A.,"Then quivered far away, and bent and broke"
4817,S. M. A.,In flashing fragments;
4818,S. M. A.,
4819,S. M. A.,And there came a peal
4820,S. M. A.,"That shook the mighty sea from shore to shore,"
4821,S. M. A.,But did not stir a sand-grain on the beach;
4822,S. M. A.,"Then silence fell, and where the low cloud hung"
4823,S. M. A.,Clouds darker gathered -- and they proudly waved
4824,S. M. A.,Like flags before a battle.
4825,S. M. A.,
4826,S. M. A.,We twain walked --
4827,S. M. A.,"We walked between the lightning's parted gleams,"
4828,S. M. A.,"We walked between the thunders of the skies,"
4829,S. M. A.,"We walked between the wavings of the clouds,"
4830,S. M. A.,"We walked between the tremblings of the sea,"
4831,S. M. A.,We walked between the stillnesses and roars
4832,S. M. A.,Of frightened billows; and we walked between
4833,S. M. A.,The coming tempest and the dying calm --
4834,S. M. A.,Between the tranquil and the terrible --
4835,S. M. A.,That hour beside the sea.
4836,S. M. A.,
4837,S. M. A.,There was a rock
4838,S. M. A.,Far up the winding beach that jutted in
4839,S. M. A.,"The sea, and broke the heart of every wave"
4840,S. M. A.,That struck its breast; not steep enough nor high
4841,S. M. A.,"To be a cliff, nor yet sufficient rough"
4842,S. M. A.,"To be a crag; a simple, low, lone rock;"
4843,S. M. A.,Yet not so low as that its brow was laved
4844,S. M. A.,"By highest tide, yet not sufficient high"
4845,S. M. A.,To rise beyond the reach of silver spray
4846,S. M. A.,That rained up from the waves -- their tears that fell
4847,S. M. A.,"Upon its face, when they died at its feet."
4848,S. M. A.,"Around its sides damp seaweed hung in long,"
4849,S. M. A.,"Sad tresses, dripping down into the sea."
4850,S. M. A.,"A tuft or two of grass did green the rock,"
4851,S. M. A.,A patch or so of moss; the rest was bare.
4852,S. M. A.,
4853,S. M. A.,Adown the shore we walked 'tween eve and night;
4854,S. M. A.,But when we reached the rock the eve and night
4855,S. M. A.,Had met; light died; we sat down in the dark
4856,S. M. A.,Upon the rock.
4857,S. M. A.,
4858,S. M. A.,Meantime a thousand clouds
4859,S. M. A.,Careered and clashed in air -- a thousand waves
4860,S. M. A.,Whirled wildly on in wrath -- a thousand winds
4861,S. M. A.,"Howled hoarsely on the main, and down the skies"
4862,S. M. A.,"Into the hollow seas the fierce rain rushed,"
4863,S. M. A.,As if its ev'ry drop were hot with wrath;
4864,S. M. A.,"And, like a thousand serpents intercoiled,"
4865,S. M. A.,"The lightnings glared and hissed, and hissed and glared,"
4866,S. M. A.,And all the horror shrank in horror back
4867,S. M. A.,Before the maddest peals that ever leaped
4868,S. M. A.,Out from the thunder's throat.
4869,S. M. A.,
4870,S. M. A.,Within the dark
4871,S. M. A.,"We silent sat.  No rain fell on the rock,"
4872,S. M. A.,"Nor in on land, nor shore; only on sea"
4873,S. M. A.,The upper and the lower waters met
4874,S. M. A.,"In wild delirium, like a thousand hearts"
4875,S. M. A.,"Far parted -- parted long -- which meet to break,"
4876,S. M. A.,Which rush into each other's arms and break
4877,S. M. A.,In terror and in tempests wild of tears.
4878,S. M. A.,No rain fell on the rock; but flakes of foam
4879,S. M. A.,"Swept cold against our faces, where we sat"
4880,S. M. A.,"Between the hush and howling of the winds,"
4881,S. M. A.,"Between the swells and sinking of the waves,"
4882,S. M. A.,"Between the stormy sea and stilly shore,"
4883,S. M. A.,"Between the rushings of the maddened rains,"
4884,S. M. A.,Between the dark beneath and dark above.
4885,S. M. A.,
4886,S. M. A.,We sat within the dread heart of the night:
4887,S. M. A.,"One, pale with terror; one, as calm and still"
4888,S. M. A.,"And stern and moveless as the lone, low rock."

4897,S. M. A.,
4898,S. M. A.,
4899,S. M. A.,Winter on the mountains
4900,S. M. A.,"Summer on the shore,"
4901,S. M. A.,"The robes of sun-gleams woven,"
4902,S. M. A.,The lake's blue wavelets wore.
4903,S. M. A.,
4904,S. M. A.,"Cold, white, against the heavens,"
4905,S. M. A.,"Flashed winter's crown of snow,"
4906,S. M. A.,And the blossoms of the spring-tide
4907,S. M. A.,Waved brightly far below.
4908,S. M. A.,
4909,S. M. A.,"The mountain's head was dreary,"
4910,S. M. A.,"The cold and cloud were there,"
4911,S. M. A.,But the mountain's feet were sandaled
4912,S. M. A.,With flowers of beauty rare.
4913,S. M. A.,
4914,S. M. A.,And winding thro' the mountains
4915,S. M. A.,"The lake's calm wavelets rolled,"
4916,S. M. A.,And a cloudless sun was gilding
4917,S. M. A.,Their ripples with its gold.
4918,S. M. A.,
4919,S. M. A.,Adown the lake we glided
4920,S. M. A.,Thro' all the sunlit day;
4921,S. M. A.,"The cold snows gleamed above us,"
4922,S. M. A.,But fair flowers fringed our way
4923,S. M. A.,
4924,S. M. A.,"The snows crept down the mountain,"
4925,S. M. A.,"The flowers crept up the slope,"
4926,S. M. A.,"Till they seemed to meet and mingle,"
4927,S. M. A.,Like human fear and hope.
4928,S. M. A.,
4929,S. M. A.,"But the same rich, golden sunlight"
4930,S. M. A.,"Fell on the flowers and snow,"
4931,S. M. A.,Like the smile of God that flashes
4932,S. M. A.,On hearts in joy or woe.
4933,S. M. A.,
4934,S. M. A.,And on the lake's low margin
4935,S. M. A.,"The trees wore stoles of green,"
4936,S. M. A.,"While here and there, amid them,"
4937,S. M. A.,A convent cross was seen.
4938,S. M. A.,
4939,S. M. A.,"Anon a ruined castle,"
4940,S. M. A.,"Moss-mantled, loomed in view,"
4941,S. M. A.,And cast its solemn shadow
4942,S. M. A.,Across the water's blue.
4943,S. M. A.,
4944,S. M. A.,"And chapel, cot, and villa,"
4945,S. M. A.,"Met here and there our gaze,"
4946,S. M. A.,And many a crumbling tower
4947,S. M. A.,That told of other days.
4948,S. M. A.,
4949,S. M. A.,And scattered o'er the waters
4950,S. M. A.,"The fishing boats lay still,"
4951,S. M. A.,And sound of song so softly
4952,S. M. A.,Came echoed from the hill.
4953,S. M. A.,
4954,S. M. A.,At times the mountain's shadow
4955,S. M. A.,"Fell dark across the scene,"
4956,S. M. A.,And veiled with veil of purple
4957,S. M. A.,The wavelets' silver sheen.
4958,S. M. A.,
4959,S. M. A.,But for a moment only
4960,S. M. A.,"The lake would wind, and lo!"

4962,S. M. A.,Of the sunlight's brightest glow.
4963,S. M. A.,
4964,S. M. A.,At times there fell a silence
4965,S. M. A.,"Unbroken by a tone,"

4968,S. M. A.,
4969,S. M. A.,Through strange and lonely places
4970,S. M. A.,We glided thus for hours;
4971,S. M. A.,We saw no other faces
4972,S. M. A.,But the faces of the flowers.
4973,S. M. A.,
4974,S. M. A.,The shores were sad and lonely
4975,S. M. A.,"As hearts without a love,"
4976,S. M. A.,While darker and more dreary
4977,S. M. A.,The mountains rose above.
4978,S. M. A.,
4979,S. M. A.,But sudden round a headland
4980,S. M. A.,"The lake would sweep again,"
4981,S. M. A.,And voices from a village
4982,S. M. A.,Would meet us with their strain.
4983,S. M. A.,
4984,S. M. A.,"Thus all the day we glided,"
4985,S. M. A.,Until the Vesper bell
4986,S. M. A.,"Gave to the day, at sunset,"
4987,S. M. A.,Its sweet and soft farewell.
4988,S. M. A.,
4989,S. M. A.,Then back again we glided
4990,S. M. A.,"Upon our homeward way,"
4991,S. M. A.,When twilight wrapped the waters
4992,S. M. A.,And the mountains with its gray.
4993,S. M. A.,
4994,S. M. A.,"But brief the reign of twilight,"
4995,S. M. A.,The night came quickly on;
4996,S. M. A.,"The dark brow o'er the mountains,"
4997,S. M. A.,"Star-wreathed, brightly shone."
4998,S. M. A.,
4999,S. M. A.,And down thro' all the shadows
5000,S. M. A.,"The star-gleams softly crept,"
5001,S. M. A.,"And kissed, with lips all shining,"
5002,S. M. A.,The wavelets ere they slept.
5003,S. M. A.,
5004,S. M. A.,"The lake lay in a slumber,"
5005,S. M. A.,"The shadows for its screen,"
5006,S. M. A.,While silence waved her sceptre
5007,S. M. A.,Above the sleeping scene.
5008,S. M. A.,
5009,S. M. A.,The spirit of the darkness
5010,S. M. A.,"Moved, ghost-like, everywhere;"
5011,S. M. A.,"Wherever starlight glimmered,"
5012,S. M. A.,"Its shadow, sure, fell there."
5013,S. M. A.,
5014,S. M. A.,"The lone place grew more lonely,"
5015,S. M. A.,And all along our way
5016,S. M. A.,The mysteries of the night-time
5017,S. M. A.,Held undisputed sway.
5018,S. M. A.,
5019,S. M. A.,Thro' silence and thro' darkness
5020,S. M. A.,We glided down the tide
5021,S. M. A.,That wound around the mountains
5022,S. M. A.,That rose on either side.
5023,S. M. A.,
5024,S. M. A.,No eyes would close in slumber
5025,S. M. A.,Within our little bark;
5026,S. M. A.,What charmed us so in daylight
5027,S. M. A.,So awed us in the dark.
5028,S. M. A.,
5029,S. M. A.,"Upon the deck we lingered,"
5030,S. M. A.,A whisper scarce was heard;
5031,S. M. A.,"When hearts are stirred profoundest,"
5032,S. M. A.,Lips are without a word.
5033,S. M. A.,
5034,S. M. A.,"""Let's say the Chaplet,"" softly"
5035,S. M. A.,A voice beside me spake.
5036,S. M. A.,"""Christ walked once in the darkness"
5037,S. M. A.,"Across an Eastern lake,"
5038,S. M. A.,
5039,S. M. A.,"""And to-night we know the secret"
5040,S. M. A.,That will charm Him to our side:

5042,S. M. A.,"He will meet us on the tide."""
5043,S. M. A.,
5044,S. M. A.,"So we said the beads together,"
5045,S. M. A.,Up and down the little bark;

5458,S. M. A.,"God so gently draweth nigh,"
5459,S. M. A.,And the brightest blessings brings.
5460,S. M. A.,
5461,S. M. A.,"List! e'en now a wild bird sings,"
5462,S. M. A.,And the roses seem to hear
5463,S. M. A.,"Every note that thrills my ear,"
5464,S. M. A.,"Rising to the heavens clear,"
5465,S. M. A.,And my soul soars on its wings
5466,S. M. A.,
5467,S. M. A.,Up into the silent skies
5468,S. M. A.,"Where the sunbeams veil the star,"
5469,S. M. A.,"Up -- beyond the clouds afar,"
5470,S. M. A.,"Where no discords ever mar,"
5471,S. M. A.,Where rests peace that never dies.
5472,S. M. A.,
5473,S. M. A.,"So I live within the calm,"
5474,S. M. A.,And the birds and roses know
5475,S. M. A.,That the days that come and go

5489,S. M. A.,"From breaking hearts, thro' pallid lips"
5490,S. M. A.,O my God! woe are we!
5491,S. M. A.,Trembleth the mourner's song;
5492,S. M. A.,"A blight is falling on the fair,"
5493,S. M. A.,"And hope is dying in despair,"
5494,S. M. A.,And terror walketh everywhere.

5496,S. M. A.,All the hours are full of tears --
5497,S. M. A.,O my God! woe are we!
5498,S. M. A.,Grief keeps watch in brightest eyes --

5505,S. M. A.,
5506,S. M. A.,Ah! the terrible farewells!
5507,S. M. A.,Woe are they! woe are they!
5508,S. M. A.,"When last words sink into moans,"

5517,S. M. A.,O my God! woe are we!
5518,S. M. A.,Cowereth every human life.
5519,S. M. A.,Wild the wailing; to and fro!
5520,S. M. A.,Woe are all! woe are we!
5521,S. M. A.,Death is victor in the strife:
5522,S. M. A.,In the hut and in the hall
5523,S. M. A.,He is writing on the wall
5524,S. M. A.,Dooms for many -- fears for all.

5531,S. M. A.,Victims strew the spectre's path;
5532,S. M. A.,Shy-eyed children softly creep
5533,S. M. A.,Where their mothers wail and weep --
5534,S. M. A.,In the grave their fathers sleep.
5535,S. M. A.,
5536,S. M. A.,"Mothers waft their prayers on high,"
5537,S. M. A.,O my God! woe are we!
5538,S. M. A.,With their dead child on their breast.
5539,S. M. A.,And the altars ask the sky --
5540,S. M. A.,O my Christ! woe are we!

5542,S. M. A.,"Spare thy people! mercy! spare!"""
5543,S. M. A.,Answer will not come to prayer --
5544,S. M. A.,Horror moveth everywhere.
5545,S. M. A.,
5546,S. M. A.,And the temples miss the priest --
5547,S. M. A.,O my God! woe are we!

5549,S. M. A.,Husband at your bridal feast --
5550,S. M. A.,Woe are you! woe are you!

5554,S. M. A.,All the strength of love is vain.
5555,S. M. A.,
5556,S. M. A.,Weep? but tears are weak as foam --
5557,S. M. A.,Woe are ye! woe are we!
5558,S. M. A.,They but break upon the shore
5559,S. M. A.,Winding between here and home --
5560,S. M. A.,Woe are ye! woe are we!
5561,S. M. A.,Wailing never! nevermore!
5562,S. M. A.,"Ah! the dead! they are so lone,"
5563,S. M. A.,"Just a grave, and just a stone,"
5564,S. M. A.,And the memory of a moan.
5565,S. M. A.,
5566,S. M. A.,"Pray! yes, pray! for God is sweet --"
5567,S. M. A.,O my God! woe are we!
5568,S. M. A.,Tears will trickle into prayers
5569,S. M. A.,When we kneel down at His feet --
5570,S. M. A.,Woe are we! woe are we!
5571,S. M. A.,With our crosses and our cares.

5645,S. M. A.,Round its staff 'tis drooping dreary;
5646,S. M. A.,"Furl it, fold it, it is best;"
5647,S. M. A.,"For there's not a man to wave it,"
5648,S. M. A.,"And there's not a sword to save it,"
5649,S. M. A.,And there's not one left to lave it
5650,S. M. A.,In the blood which heroes gave it;
5651,S. M. A.,And its foes now scorn and brave it;
5652,S. M. A.,"Furl it, hide it -- let it rest!"

5654,S. M. A.,Take that Banner down! 'tis tattered;

5656,S. M. A.,And the valiant hosts are scattered
5657,S. M. A.,Over whom it floated high.
5658,S. M. A.,Oh! 'tis hard for us to fold it;
5659,S. M. A.,Hard to think there's none to hold it;
5660,S. M. A.,Hard that those who once unrolled it
5661,S. M. A.,Now must furl it with a sigh.
5662,S. M. A.,
5663,S. M. A.,Furl that Banner! furl it sadly!
5664,S. M. A.,"Once ten thousands hailed it gladly,"
5665,S. M. A.,"And ten thousands wildly, madly,"

5668,S. M. A.,"Hearts like theirs entwined dissever,"

5672,S. M. A.,"Furl it! for the hands that grasped it,"
5673,S. M. A.,"And the hearts that fondly clasped it,"
5674,S. M. A.,Cold and dead are lying low;
5675,S. M. A.,And that Banner -- it is trailing!
5676,S. M. A.,While around it sounds the wailing
5677,S. M. A.,Of its people in their woe.
5678,S. M. A.,
5679,S. M. A.,"For, though conquered, they adore it!"
5680,S. M. A.,"Love the cold, dead hands that bore it!"

5686,S. M. A.,"Furl that Banner!  True, 'tis gory,"
5687,S. M. A.,"Yet 'tis wreathed around with glory,"
5688,S. M. A.,"And 'twill live in song and story,"
5689,S. M. A.,Though its folds are in the dust:
5690,S. M. A.,"For its fame on brightest pages,"
5691,S. M. A.,"Penned by poets and by sages,"
5692,S. M. A.,Shall go sounding down the ages --
5693,S. M. A.,Furl its folds though now we must.
5694,S. M. A.,
5695,S. M. A.,"Furl that Banner, softly, slowly!"
5696,S. M. A.,Treat it gently -- it is holy --
5697,S. M. A.,For it droops above the dead.
5698,S. M. A.,"Touch it not -- unfold it never,"
5699,S. M. A.,"Let it droop there, furled forever,"

5709,S. M. A.,They ask me to sing them a Christmas song
5710,S. M. A.,That with musical mirth shall ring;
5711,S. M. A.,How know I that the world's great throng
5712,S. M. A.,Will care for the words I sing?
5713,S. M. A.,
5714,S. M. A.,"Let the young and the gay chant the Christmas lay,"
5715,S. M. A.,Their voices and hearts are glad;
5716,S. M. A.,"But I -- I am old, and my locks are gray,"
5717,S. M. A.,And they tell me my voice is sad.
5718,S. M. A.,
5719,S. M. A.,"Ah! once I could sing, when my heart beat warm"
5720,S. M. A.,"With hopes, bright as life's first spring;"
5721,S. M. A.,"But the spring hath fled, and the golden charm"
5722,S. M. A.,Hath gone from the songs I sing.
5723,S. M. A.,
5724,S. M. A.,I have lost the spell that my verse could weave
5725,S. M. A.,"O'er the souls of the old and young,"
5726,S. M. A.,And never again -- how it makes me grieve --
5727,S. M. A.,Shall I sing as once I sung.
5728,S. M. A.,
5729,S. M. A.,"Why ask a song? ah! perchance you believe,"
5730,S. M. A.,"Since my days are so nearly past,"
5731,S. M. A.,That the song you'll hear on this Christmas eve
5732,S. M. A.,Is the old man's best and last.
5733,S. M. A.,
5734,S. M. A.,Do you want the jingle of rhythm and rhyme?
5735,S. M. A.,Art's sweet but meaningless notes?
5736,S. M. A.,"Or the music of thought, that, like the chime"
5737,S. M. A.,"Of a grand cathedral, floats"
5738,S. M. A.,
5739,S. M. A.,"Out of each word, and along each line,"
5740,S. M. A.,"Into the spirit's ear,"
5741,S. M. A.,Lifting it up and making it pine
5742,S. M. A.,For a something far from here;
5743,S. M. A.,
5744,S. M. A.,Bearing the wings of the soul aloft
5745,S. M. A.,From earth and its shadows dim;
5746,S. M. A.,Soothing the breast with a sound as soft
5747,S. M. A.,"As a dream, or a seraph's hymn;"
5748,S. M. A.,
5749,S. M. A.,Evoking the solemnest hopes and fears
5750,S. M. A.,From our being's higher part;
5751,S. M. A.,Dimming the eyes with radiant tears
5752,S. M. A.,That flow from a spell bound heart?
5753,S. M. A.,
5754,S. M. A.,"Do they want a song that is only a song,"
5755,S. M. A.,With no mystical meanings rife?
5756,S. M. A.,Or a music that solemnly moves along --
5757,S. M. A.,The undertone of a life!
5758,S. M. A.,
5759,S. M. A.,"Well, then, I'll sing, though I know no art,"
5760,S. M. A.,Nor the poet's rhymes nor rules --
5761,S. M. A.,A melody moves through my aged heart
5762,S. M. A.,Not learned from the books or schools:
5763,S. M. A.,
5764,S. M. A.,A music I learned in the days long gone --
5765,S. M. A.,I cannot tell where or how --
5766,S. M. A.,"But no matter where, it still sounds on"
5767,S. M. A.,Back of this wrinkled brow.
5768,S. M. A.,
5769,S. M. A.,"And down in my heart I hear it still,"
5770,S. M. A.,Like the echoes of far-off bells;
5771,S. M. A.,Like the dreamy sound of a summer rill
5772,S. M. A.,Flowing through fairy dells.
5773,S. M. A.,
5774,S. M. A.,"But what shall I sing for the world's gay throng,"
5775,S. M. A.,And what the words of the old man's song?
5776,S. M. A.,
5777,S. M. A.,"The world they tell me, is so giddy grown"
5778,S. M. A.,That thought is rare;
5779,S. M. A.,And thoughtless minds and shallow hearts alone
5780,S. M. A.,Hold empire there;
5781,S. M. A.,
5782,S. M. A.,"That fools have prestige, place and power and fame;"
5783,S. M. A.,Can it be true
5784,S. M. A.,"That wisdom is a scorn, a hissing shame,"
5785,S. M. A.,And wise are few?
5786,S. M. A.,
5787,S. M. A.,"They tell me, too, that all is venal, vain,"
5788,S. M. A.,With high and low;
5789,S. M. A.,That truth and honor are the slaves of gain;
5790,S. M. A.,Can it be so?
5791,S. M. A.,
5792,S. M. A.,That lofty principle hath long been dead
5793,S. M. A.,And in a shroud;
5794,S. M. A.,"That virtue walks ashamed, with downcast head,"
5795,S. M. A.,Amid the crowd.
5796,S. M. A.,
5797,S. M. A.,"They tell me, too, that few they are who own"
5798,S. M. A.,God's law and love;
5799,S. M. A.,"That thousands, living for this earth alone,"
5800,S. M. A.,Look not above;
5801,S. M. A.,
5802,S. M. A.,"That daily, hourly, from the bad to worse,"
5803,S. M. A.,"Men tread the path,"
5804,S. M. A.,"Blaspheming God, and careless of the curse"
5805,S. M. A.,Of his dead wrath.
5806,S. M. A.,
5807,S. M. A.,"And must I sing for slaves of sordid gain,"
5808,S. M. A.,Or to the few
5809,S. M. A.,Shall I not dedicate this Christmas strain
5810,S. M. A.,Who still are true?
5811,S. M. A.,
5812,S. M. A.,No; not for the false shall I strike the strings
5813,S. M. A.,Of the lyre that was mute so long;
5814,S. M. A.,"If I sing at all, the gray bard sings"
5815,S. M. A.,For the few and the true his song.
5816,S. M. A.,
5817,S. M. A.,And ah! there is many a changeful mood
5818,S. M. A.,That over my spirit steals;
5819,S. M. A.,"Beneath their spell, and in verses rude,"
5820,S. M. A.,Whatever he dreams or feels.
5821,S. M. A.,
5822,S. M. A.,Whatever the fancies this Christmas eve
5823,S. M. A.,"Are haunting the lonely man,"
5824,S. M. A.,"Whether they gladden, or whether they grieve,"
5825,S. M. A.,He'll sing them as best he can.
5826,S. M. A.,
5827,S. M. A.,Though some of the strings of his lyre are broke
5828,S. M. A.,"This holiest night of the year,"
5829,S. M. A.,Who knows how its melody may wake
5830,S. M. A.,A Christmas smile or a tear?
5831,S. M. A.,
5832,S. M. A.,"So on with the mystic song,"
5833,S. M. A.,With its meaning manifold --
5834,S. M. A.,"Two tones in every word,"
5835,S. M. A.,Two thoughts in every tone;
5836,S. M. A.,In the measured words that move along
5837,S. M. A.,"One meaning shall be heard,"
5838,S. M. A.,One thought to all be told;
5839,S. M. A.,"But under it all, to be alone --"
5840,S. M. A.,"And under it all, to all unknown --"
5841,S. M. A.,"As safe as under a coffin-lid,"
5842,S. M. A.,Deep meanings shall be hid.
5843,S. M. A.,Find them out who can!
5844,S. M. A.,The thoughts concealed and unrevealed

5851,S. M. A.,Watching the fire-flame fill the gloom
5852,S. M. A.,With many a picture bright.
5853,S. M. A.,Ah! how the fire can paint!
5854,S. M. A.,"Its magic skill, how strange!"
5855,S. M. A.,How every spark
5856,S. M. A.,On the canvas dark
5857,S. M. A.,Draws figures and forms so quaint!
5858,S. M. A.,And how the pictures change!
5859,S. M. A.,One moment how they smile!
5860,S. M. A.,"And in less than a little while,"
5861,S. M. A.,"In the twinkling of an eye,"
5862,S. M. A.,"Like the gleam of a summer sky,"
5863,S. M. A.,The beaming smiles all die.
5864,S. M. A.,
5865,S. M. A.,From gay to grave -- from grave to gay --
5866,S. M. A.,The faces change in the shadows gray;
5867,S. M. A.,"And just as I wonder who they are,"
5868,S. M. A.,"Over them all,"
5869,S. M. A.,"Like a funeral pall,"
5870,S. M. A.,"The folds of the shadows droop and fall,"
5871,S. M. A.,"And the charm is gone,"
5872,S. M. A.,And every one
5873,S. M. A.,Of the pictures fade away.
5874,S. M. A.,
5875,S. M. A.,Ah! the fire within my grate
5876,S. M. A.,"Hath more than Raphael's power,"
5877,S. M. A.,Is more than Raphael's peer;
5878,S. M. A.,It paints for me in a little hour
5879,S. M. A.,More than he in a year;
5880,S. M. A.,And the pictures hanging 'round me here
5881,S. M. A.,This holy Christmas eve
5882,S. M. A.,No artist's pencil could create --
5883,S. M. A.,No painter's art conceive;
5884,S. M. A.,
5885,S. M. A.,"Ah! those cheerful faces,"
5886,S. M. A.,Wearing youthful graces!
5887,S. M. A.,I gaze on them until I seem
5888,S. M. A.,Half awake and half in dream.
5889,S. M. A.,"There are brows without a mark,"
5890,S. M. A.,Features bright without a shade;
5891,S. M. A.,There are eyes without a tear;
5892,S. M. A.,There are lips unused to sigh.
5893,S. M. A.,Ah! never mind -- you soon shall die!
5894,S. M. A.,"All those faces soon shall fade,"
5895,S. M. A.,Fade into the dreary dark
5896,S. M. A.,Like their pictures hanging here.
5897,S. M. A.,"-- Lo! those tearful faces,"
5898,S. M. A.,Bearing age's traces!
5899,S. M. A.,
5900,S. M. A.,"I gaze on them, and they on me,"
5901,S. M. A.,Until I feel a sorrow steal
5902,S. M. A.,Through my heart so drearily;
5903,S. M. A.,There are faces furrowed deep;
5904,S. M. A.,There are eyes that used to weep;
5905,S. M. A.,There are brows beneath a cloud;
5906,S. M. A.,There are hearts that want to sleep;
5907,S. M. A.,Never mind! the shadows creep
5908,S. M. A.,"From the death-land; and a shroud,"
5909,S. M. A.,"Tenderly as mother's arm,"
5910,S. M. A.,"Soon shall shield the old from harm,"
5911,S. M. A.,Soon shall wrap its robe of rest
5912,S. M. A.,Round each sorrow-haunted breast
5913,S. M. A.,"Ah! that face of mother's,"
5914,S. M. A.,"Sister's, too, and brother's --"
5915,S. M. A.,"And so many others,"
5916,S. M. A.,Dear is every name --
5917,S. M. A.,"And Ethel!  Thou art there,"
5918,S. M. A.,"With thy child-face sweet and fair,"
5919,S. M. A.,And thy heart so bright
5920,S. M. A.,In its shroud so white;
5921,S. M. A.,Just as I saw you last
5922,S. M. A.,"In the golden, happy past;"
5923,S. M. A.,And you seem to wear
5924,S. M. A.,Upon your hair --
5925,S. M. A.,"Your waving, golden hair --"
5926,S. M. A.,The smile of the setting sun.
5927,S. M. A.,"Ah! me, how years will run!"
5928,S. M. A.,But all the years cannot efface
5929,S. M. A.,"Your purest name, your sweetest grace,"
5930,S. M. A.,From the heart that still is true
5931,S. M. A.,Of all the world to you;
5932,S. M. A.,"The other faces shine,"
5933,S. M. A.,But none so fair as thine;
5934,S. M. A.,"And wherever they are to-night, I know"
5935,S. M. A.,They look the very same
5936,S. M. A.,As in their pictures hanging here
5937,S. M. A.,"This night, to memory dear,"
5938,S. M. A.,"And painted by the flames,"
5939,S. M. A.,"With tombstones in the background,"
5940,S. M. A.,And shadows for their frames.
5941,S. M. A.,
5942,S. M. A.,"And thus with my pictures only,"
5943,S. M. A.,"And the fancies they unweave,"
5944,S. M. A.,"Alone, and yet not lonely,"
5945,S. M. A.,I keep my Christmas eve.
5946,S. M. A.,I'm sitting alone in my pictured room --
5947,S. M. A.,"But, no! they have vanished all --"
5948,S. M. A.,"I'm watching the fire-glow fade into gloom,"
5949,S. M. A.,I'm watching the ashes fall.
5950,S. M. A.,And far away back of the cheerful blaze
5951,S. M. A.,The beautiful visions of by-gone days
5952,S. M. A.,Are rising before my raptured gaze.
5953,S. M. A.,"Ah! Christmas fire, so bright and warm,"
5954,S. M. A.,Hast thou a wizard's magic charm
5955,S. M. A.,To bring those far-off scenes so near
5956,S. M. A.,And make my past days meet me here?
5957,S. M. A.,
5958,S. M. A.,Tell me -- tell me -- how is it?
5959,S. M. A.,"The past is past, and here I sit,"
5960,S. M. A.,"And there, lo! there before me rise,"
5961,S. M. A.,"Beyond yon glowing flame,"
5962,S. M. A.,"The summer suns of childhood's skies,"
5963,S. M. A.,Yes -- yes -- the very same!
5964,S. M. A.,"I saw them rise long, long ago;"
5965,S. M. A.,I played beneath their golden glow;
5966,S. M. A.,"And I remember yet,"
5967,S. M. A.,I often cried with strange regret
5968,S. M. A.,When in the west I saw them set
5969,S. M. A.,And there they are again;
5970,S. M. A.,"The suns, the skies, the very days"
5971,S. M. A.,"Of childhood, just beyond that blaze!"
5972,S. M. A.,"But, ah! such visions almost craze"
5973,S. M. A.,The old man's puzzled brain!
5974,S. M. A.,I thought the past was past!
5975,S. M. A.,"But, no! it cannot be;"
5976,S. M. A.,'Tis here to-night with me!
5977,S. M. A.,
5978,S. M. A.,"How is it, then? the past of men"
5979,S. M. A.,Is part of one eternity --
5980,S. M. A.,"The days of yore we so deplore,"
5981,S. M. A.,"They are not dead -- they are not fled,"
5982,S. M. A.,They live and live for evermore.
5983,S. M. A.,And thus my past comes back to me
5984,S. M. A.,With all its visions fair.
5985,S. M. A.,
5986,S. M. A.,"O past! could I go back to thee,"
5987,S. M. A.,And live forever there!
5988,S. M. A.,"But, no! there's frost upon my hair;"
5989,S. M. A.,My feet have trod a path of care;
5990,S. M. A.,And worn and wearied here I sit
5991,S. M. A.,I am too tired to go to it.
5992,S. M. A.,
5993,S. M. A.,"And thus with visions only,"
5994,S. M. A.,"And the fancies they unweave,"
5995,S. M. A.,"Alone, and yet not lonely,"
5996,S. M. A.,I keep my Christmas eve.
5997,S. M. A.,
5998,S. M. A.,I am sitting alone in my fire-lit room;
5999,S. M. A.,"But, no! the fire is dying,"
6000,S. M. A.,"And the weary-voiced winds, in the outer gloom,"
6001,S. M. A.,"Are sad, and I hear them sighing."
6002,S. M. A.,The wind hath a voice to pine --
6003,S. M. A.,"Plaintive, and pensive and low;"
6004,S. M. A.,Hath it a heart like mine or thine?
6005,S. M. A.,Knoweth it weal or woe?
6006,S. M. A.,"How it wails in a ghost-like strain,"
6007,S. M. A.,Just against that window pane!
6008,S. M. A.,"As if it were tired of its long, cold flight,"
6009,S. M. A.,And wanted to rest with me to-night.
6010,S. M. A.,"Cease! night-winds, cease!"
6011,S. M. A.,Why should you be sad?
6012,S. M. A.,"This is a night of joy and peace,"
6013,S. M. A.,And heaven and earth are glad!
6014,S. M. A.,But still the wind's voice grieves!
6015,S. M. A.,"Perchance o'er the fallen leaves,"
6016,S. M. A.,"Which, in their summer bloom,"
6017,S. M. A.,"Danced to the music of bird and breeze,"
6018,S. M. A.,"But, torn from the arms of their parent trees,"
6019,S. M. A.,Lie now in their wintry tomb --
6020,S. M. A.,Mute types of man's own doom.
6021,S. M. A.,
6022,S. M. A.,"And thus with the night winds only,"
6023,S. M. A.,"And the fancies they unweave,"
6024,S. M. A.,"Alone, and yet not lonely,"
6025,S. M. A.,I keep my Christmas eve.
6026,S. M. A.,
6027,S. M. A.,How long have I been dreaming here?
6028,S. M. A.,Or have I dreamed at all?
6029,S. M. A.,My fire is dead -- my pictures fled --
6030,S. M. A.,There's nothing left but shadows drear --
6031,S. M. A.,Shadows on the wall:
6032,S. M. A.,
6033,S. M. A.,"Shifting, flitting,"
6034,S. M. A.,Round me sitting
6035,S. M. A.,In my old arm chair --
6036,S. M. A.,"Rising, sinking"
6037,S. M. A.,"Round me, thinking,"
6038,S. M. A.,"Till, in the maze of many a dream,"
6039,S. M. A.,I'm not myself; and I almost seem
6040,S. M. A.,Like one of the shadows there.
6041,S. M. A.,"Well, let the shadows stay!"
6042,S. M. A.,I wonder who are they?
6043,S. M. A.,I cannot say; but I almost believe
6044,S. M. A.,"They know to-night is Christmas eve,"
6045,S. M. A.,And to-morrow Christmas day.
6046,S. M. A.,
6047,S. M. A.,Ah! there's nothing like a Christmas eve
6048,S. M. A.,"To change life's bitter gall to sweet,"
6049,S. M. A.,And change the sweet to gall again;
6050,S. M. A.,To take the thorns from out our feet --
6051,S. M. A.,"The thorns and all their dreary pain,"
6052,S. M. A.,Only to put them back again.
6053,S. M. A.,
6054,S. M. A.,To take old stings from out our heart --
6055,S. M. A.,Old stings that made them bleed and smart --
6056,S. M. A.,"Only to sharpen them the more,"
6057,S. M. A.,And press them back to the heart's own core.
6058,S. M. A.,
6059,S. M. A.,Ah! no eve is like the Christmas eve!
6060,S. M. A.,"Fears and hopes, and hopes and fears,"
6061,S. M. A.,"Tears and smiles, and smiles and tears,"
6062,S. M. A.,"Cheers and sighs, and sighs and cheers,"
6063,S. M. A.,"Sweet and bitter, bitter, sweet,"
6064,S. M. A.,"Bright and dark, and dark and bright."
6065,S. M. A.,"All these mingle, all these meet,"
6066,S. M. A.,In this great and solemn night.
6067,S. M. A.,
6068,S. M. A.,Ah! there's nothing like a Christmas eve
6069,S. M. A.,"To melt, with kindly glowing heat,"
6070,S. M. A.,"From off our souls the snow and sleet,"
6071,S. M. A.,"The dreary drift of wintry years,"
6072,S. M. A.,"Only to make the cold winds blow,"
6073,S. M. A.,Only to make a colder snow;
6074,S. M. A.,"And make it drift, and drift, and drift,"
6075,S. M. A.,"In flakes so icy-cold and swift,"
6076,S. M. A.,Until the heart that lies below
6077,S. M. A.,Is cold and colder than the snow.
6078,S. M. A.,
6079,S. M. A.,"And thus with the shadows only,"
6080,S. M. A.,"And the dreamings they unweave,"
6081,S. M. A.,"Alone, and yet not lonely,"
6082,S. M. A.,I keep my Christmas eve.
6083,S. M. A.,
6084,S. M. A.,'Tis passing fast!
6085,S. M. A.,"My fireless, lampless room"
6086,S. M. A.,Is a mass of moveless gloom;
6087,S. M. A.,"And without -- a darkness vast,"
6088,S. M. A.,Solemn -- starless -- still!
6089,S. M. A.,Heaven and earth doth fill.
6090,S. M. A.,
6091,S. M. A.,"But list! there soundeth a bell,"
6092,S. M. A.,"With a mystical ding, dong, dell!"
6093,S. M. A.,"Is it, say, is it a funeral knell?"
6094,S. M. A.,"Solemn and slow,"
6095,S. M. A.,Now loud -- now low;
6096,S. M. A.,Pealing the notes of human woe
6097,S. M. A.,Over the graves lying under the snow!
6098,S. M. A.,"Ah! that pitiless ding, dong, dell!"
6099,S. M. A.,"Trembling along the gale,"
6100,S. M. A.,Under the stars and over the snow.
6101,S. M. A.,Why is it? whence is it sounding so?
6102,S. M. A.,Is it a toll of a burial bell?
6103,S. M. A.,
6104,S. M. A.,Or is it a spirit's wail?
6105,S. M. A.,"Solemnly, mournfully,"
6106,S. M. A.,Sad -- and how lornfully!
6107,S. M. A.,"Ding, dong, dell!"
6108,S. M. A.,Whence is it? who can tell?
6109,S. M. A.,"And the marvelous notes they sink and swell,"
6110,S. M. A.,"Sadder, and sadder, and sadder still!"
6111,S. M. A.,How the sounds tremble! how they thrill!
6112,S. M. A.,Every tone
6113,S. M. A.,So like a moan;
6114,S. M. A.,As if the strange bell's stranger clang
6115,S. M. A.,Throbbed with a terrible human pang.
6116,S. M. A.,
6117,S. M. A.,"Ding, dong, dell!"
6118,S. M. A.,"Dismally, drearily,"
6119,S. M. A.,Ever so wearily.
6120,S. M. A.,Far off and faint as a requiem plaint
6121,S. M. A.,Floats the deep-toned voice of the mystic bell
6122,S. M. A.,"Piercingly -- thrillingly,"
6123,S. M. A.,"Icily -- chillingly,"
6124,S. M. A.,"Near -- and more near,"
6125,S. M. A.,"Drearer -- and more drear,"
6126,S. M. A.,"Soundeth the wild, weird, ding, dong, dell!"
6127,S. M. A.,
6128,S. M. A.,"Now sinking lower,"
6129,S. M. A.,It tolleth slower!
6130,S. M. A.,"I list, and I hear its sound no more."
6131,S. M. A.,"And now, methinks, I know that bell,"
6132,S. M. A.,Know it well -- know its knell --
6133,S. M. A.,For I often heard it sound before.
6134,S. M. A.,
6135,S. M. A.,It is a bell -- yet not a bell
6136,S. M. A.,Whose sound may reach the ear!
6137,S. M. A.,It tolls a knell -- yet not a knell
6138,S. M. A.,Which earthly sense may hear.
6139,S. M. A.,In every soul a bell of dole
6140,S. M. A.,Hangs ready to be tolled;
6141,S. M. A.,And from that bell a funeral knell
6142,S. M. A.,Is often outward rolled;
6143,S. M. A.,And memory is the sexton gray
6144,S. M. A.,Who tolls the dreary knell;
6145,S. M. A.,And nights like this he loves to sway
6146,S. M. A.,And swing his mystic bell.
6147,S. M. A.,"'Twas that I heard and nothing more,"
6148,S. M. A.,This lonely Christmas eve;
6149,S. M. A.,"Then, for the dead I'll meet no more,"
6150,S. M. A.,At Christmas let me grieve.
6151,S. M. A.,
6152,S. M. A.,"Night, be a priest! put your star-stole on"
6153,S. M. A.,And murmur a holy prayer
6154,S. M. A.,"Over each grave, and for every one"
6155,S. M. A.,Lying down lifeless there!
6156,S. M. A.,
6157,S. M. A.,"And over the dead stands the high priest, Night,"
6158,S. M. A.,Robed in his shadowy stole;
6159,S. M. A.,"And beside him I kneel as his acolyte,"
6160,S. M. A.,To respond to his prayer of dole.
6161,S. M. A.,
6162,S. M. A.,And list! he begins
6163,S. M. A.,"That psalm for sins,"
6164,S. M. A.,The first of the mournful seven;
6165,S. M. A.,Plaintive and soft
6166,S. M. A.,"It rises aloft,"
6167,S. M. A.,Begging the mercy of Heaven
6168,S. M. A.,"To pity and forgive,"
6169,S. M. A.,"For the sake of those who live,"
6170,S. M. A.,The dead who have died unshriven.
6171,S. M. A.,Miserere! Miserere!
6172,S. M. A.,Still your heart and hush your breath!
6173,S. M. A.,The voices of despair and death
6174,S. M. A.,Are shuddering through the psalm!
6175,S. M. A.,Miserere! Miserere!
6176,S. M. A.,Lift your hearts! the terror dies!
6177,S. M. A.,Up in yonder sinless skies
6178,S. M. A.,The psalms sound sweet and calm!
6179,S. M. A.,Miserere! Miserere!
6180,S. M. A.,"Very low, in tender tones,"
6181,S. M. A.,"The music pleads, the music moans,"
6182,S. M. A.,"""I forgive and have forgiven,"
6183,S. M. A.,"The dead whose hearts were shriven."""
6184,S. M. A.,De profundis! De profundis!
6185,S. M. A.,Psalm of the dead and disconsolate!
6186,S. M. A.,"Thou hast sounded through a thousand years,"
6187,S. M. A.,And pealed above ten thousand biers;
6188,S. M. A.,"And still, sad psalm, you mourn the fate"
6189,S. M. A.,"Of sinners and of just,"
6190,S. M. A.,"When their souls are going up to God,"
6191,S. M. A.,Their bodies down to dust.
6192,S. M. A.,Dread hymn! you wring the saddest tears
6193,S. M. A.,"From mortal eyes that fall,"
6194,S. M. A.,And your notes evoke the darkest fears
6195,S. M. A.,That human hearts appall!
6196,S. M. A.,"You sound o'er the good, you sound o'er the bad,"
6197,S. M. A.,"And ever your music is sad, so sad,"
6198,S. M. A.,"We seem to hear murmured in every tone,"
6199,S. M. A.,For the saintly a blessing; for sinners a curse.
6200,S. M. A.,"Psalm, sad psalm! you must pray and grieve"
6201,S. M. A.,Over our dead on this Christmas eve.
6202,S. M. A.,De profundis! De profundis!
6203,S. M. A.,"And the night chants the psalm o'er the mortal clay,"
6204,S. M. A.,"And the spirits immortal from far away,"
6205,S. M. A.,To the music of hope sing this sweet-toned lay.
6206,S. M. A.,
6207,S. M. A.,"You think of the dead on Christmas eve,"
6208,S. M. A.,"Wherever the dead are sleeping,"
6209,S. M. A.,And we from a land where we may not grieve
6210,S. M. A.,Look tenderly down on your weeping.
6211,S. M. A.,"You think us far, we are very near,"
6212,S. M. A.,"From you and the earth, though parted;"
6213,S. M. A.,We sing to-night to console and cheer
6214,S. M. A.,The hearts of the broken-hearted.
6215,S. M. A.,The earth watches over the lifeless clay
6216,S. M. A.,"Of each of its countless sleepers,"
6217,S. M. A.,And the sleepless spirits that passed away
6218,S. M. A.,Watch over all earth's weepers.
6219,S. M. A.,"We shall meet again in a brighter land,"
6220,S. M. A.,Where farewell is never spoken;
6221,S. M. A.,"We shall clasp each other in hand,"
6222,S. M. A.,And the clasp shall not be broken;
6223,S. M. A.,"We shall meet again, in a bright, calm clime,"
6224,S. M. A.,"Where we'll never know a sadness,"
6225,S. M. A.,"And our lives shall be filled, like a Christmas chime,"
6226,S. M. A.,With rapture and with gladness.
6227,S. M. A.,"The snows shall pass from our graves away,"
6228,S. M. A.,"And you from the earth, remember;"
6229,S. M. A.,"And the flowers of a bright, eternal May,"
6230,S. M. A.,Shall follow earth's December.
6231,S. M. A.,When you think of us think not of the tomb
6232,S. M. A.,Where you laid us down in sorrow;
6233,S. M. A.,"But look aloft, and beyond earth's gloom,"
6234,S. M. A.,And wait for the great to-morrow.
6235,S. M. A.,"And the pontiff, Night, with his star-stole on,"
6236,S. M. A.,Whispereth soft and low:
6237,S. M. A.,Requiescat! Requiescat!
6238,S. M. A.,

6665,S. M. A.,And rays rush o'er their rhymes
6666,S. M. A.,"From suns of ""days to be""."
6667,S. M. A.,
6668,S. M. A.,"They see To-morrow's heart,"
6669,S. M. A.,"They read To-morrow's face,"
6670,S. M. A.,They grasp -- is it by art --
6671,S. M. A.,The far To-morrow's trace?
6672,S. M. A.,
6673,S. M. A.,"They see what is unseen,"
6674,S. M. A.,"And hear what is unheard,"
6675,S. M. A.,And To-morrow's shade or sheen
6676,S. M. A.,Rests on the poet's word.
6677,S. M. A.,
6678,S. M. A.,As seers see a star
6679,S. M. A.,"Beyond the brow of night,"
6680,S. M. A.,So poets scan the far
6681,S. M. A.,Prophetic when they write.
6682,S. M. A.,
6683,S. M. A.,"They read a human face,"
6684,S. M. A.,"As readers read their page,"
6685,S. M. A.,The while their thought will trace
6686,S. M. A.,A life from youth to age.
6687,S. M. A.,
6688,S. M. A.,"They have a mournful gift,"
6689,S. M. A.,Their verses oft are tears;
6690,S. M. A.,And sleepless eyes they lift
6691,S. M. A.,To look adown the years.
6692,S. M. A.,
6693,S. M. A.,To-morrows are to-days!
6694,S. M. A.,Is it not more than art?
6695,S. M. A.,When all life's winding ways
6696,S. M. A.,Meet in the poet's heart?
6697,S. M. A.,
6698,S. M. A.,"The present meets the past,"
6699,S. M. A.,"The future, too, is there;"
6700,S. M. A.,The first enclasps the last
6701,S. M. A.,And never folds fore'er.
6702,S. M. A.,
6703,S. M. A.,It is not all a dream;
6704,S. M. A.,A poet's thought is truth;
6705,S. M. A.,The things that are -- and seem
6706,S. M. A.,From age far back to youth --
6707,S. M. A.,
6708,S. M. A.,"He holds the tangled threads,"
6709,S. M. A.,His hands unravel them;
6710,S. M. A.,He knows the hearts and heads
6711,S. M. A.,"For thorns, or diadem."
6712,S. M. A.,
6713,S. M. A.,"Ask him, and he will see"
6714,S. M. A.,What your To-morrows are;
6715,S. M. A.,"He'll sing ""What is to be"""
6716,S. M. A.,Beneath each sun and star.
6717,S. M. A.,
6718,S. M. A.,To-morrows!  Dread unknown!
6719,S. M. A.,What fates may they not bring?
6720,S. M. A.,What is the chord? the tone?
6721,S. M. A.,The key in which they sing?
6722,S. M. A.,
6723,S. M. A.,"I see a thousand throngs,"
6724,S. M. A.,To-morrows for them wait;
6725,S. M. A.,I hear a thousand songs
6726,S. M. A.,Intoning each one's fate.
6727,S. M. A.,
6728,S. M. A.,And yours?  What will it be?
6729,S. M. A.,"Hush! song, and let me pray!"
6730,S. M. A.,God sees it all -- I see
6731,S. M. A.,"A long, lone, winding way;"
6732,S. M. A.,
6733,S. M. A.,And more! no matter what!
6734,S. M. A.,Crosses and crowns you wear:
6735,S. M. A.,"My song may be forgot,"

6744,S. M. A.,
6745,S. M. A.,"What has been will be,"
6746,S. M. A.,'Tis the under law of life;
6747,S. M. A.,"'Tis the song of sky and sea,"
6748,S. M. A.,To the key of calm and strife.
6749,S. M. A.,
6750,S. M. A.,"For guard we as we may,"
6751,S. M. A.,"What is to be will be,"
6752,S. M. A.,The dark must fold each day --
6753,S. M. A.,The shore must gird each sea.
6754,S. M. A.,
6755,S. M. A.,All things are ruled by law;
6756,S. M. A.,'Tis only in man's will
6757,S. M. A.,You meet a feeble flaw;

6759,S. M. A.,
6760,S. M. A.,"The web and woof of life,"
6761,S. M. A.,"With hands that have no hearts,"
6762,S. M. A.,"Thro' calmness and thro' strife,"
6763,S. M. A.,Despite all human arts.
6764,S. M. A.,
6765,S. M. A.,"For fate is master here,"
6766,S. M. A.,He laughs at human wiles;
6767,S. M. A.,"He sceptres every tear,"
6768,S. M. A.,And fetters any smiles.
6769,S. M. A.,
6770,S. M. A.,"What is to be will be,"
6771,S. M. A.,We cannot help ourselves;
6772,S. M. A.,The waves ask not the sea
6773,S. M. A.,Where lies the shore that shelves.
6774,S. M. A.,
6775,S. M. A.,"The law is coldest steel,"
6776,S. M. A.,"We live beneath its sway,"
6777,S. M. A.,"It cares not what we feel,"
6778,S. M. A.,And so pass night and day.
6779,S. M. A.,
6780,S. M. A.,And sometimes we may think
6781,S. M. A.,This cannot -- will not -- be:
6782,S. M. A.,"Some waves must rise -- some sink,"
6783,S. M. A.,Out on the midnight sea.
6784,S. M. A.,
6785,S. M. A.,And we are weak as waves
6786,S. M. A.,That sink upon the shore;
6787,S. M. A.,We go down into graves --
6788,S. M. A.,Fate chants the nevermore;
6789,S. M. A.,
6790,S. M. A.,Cometh a voice!  Kneel down!
6791,S. M. A.,'Tis God's -- there is no fate --
6792,S. M. A.,"He giveth the Cross and Crown,"
6793,S. M. A.,He opens the jeweled gate.
6794,S. M. A.,
6795,S. M. A.,He watcheth with such eyes

7491,S. M. A.,"No one knows,"
7492,S. M. A.,"When your holy songs are heard,"
7493,S. M. A.,What repose
7494,S. M. A.,
7495,S. M. A.,Fills my life and soothes my heart;
7496,S. M. A.,But I fear
7497,S. M. A.,"The day -- thy songs, if we must part,"
7498,S. M. A.,I'll never hear.
7499,S. M. A.,
7500,S. M. A.,"But ""Singing-Bird!"" ah! ""Singing-Bird!"""
7501,S. M. A.,"Should this e'er be,"

7514,S. M. A.,As from a temple tower
7515,S. M. A.,There often falls a chime
7516,S. M. A.,"From blessed bells, that seems"
7517,S. M. A.,To fold in Heaven's dreams
7518,S. M. A.,Our spirits round a shrine;

7521,S. M. A.,Sometimes -- who knoweth why?
7522,S. M. A.,One minute holds a power
7523,S. M. A.,"That shadows every hour,"
7524,S. M. A.,Dialed in life's sky.
7525,S. M. A.,A cloud that is a speck
7526,S. M. A.,When seen from far away
7527,S. M. A.,"May be a storm, and wreck"
7528,S. M. A.,The joys of every day.
7529,S. M. A.,
7530,S. M. A.,"Sometimes -- it seems not much,"
7531,S. M. A.,'Tis scarcely felt at all --
7532,S. M. A.,Grace gives a gentle touch
7533,S. M. A.,"To hearts for once and all,"
7534,S. M. A.,Which in the spirit's strife
7535,S. M. A.,May all unnoticed be.
7536,S. M. A.,And yet it rules a life;

7539,S. M. A.,"Sometimes one little word,"
7540,S. M. A.,"Whispered sweet and fleet,"
7541,S. M. A.,"That scarcely can be heard,"
7542,S. M. A.,Our ears will sudden meet.
7543,S. M. A.,And all life's hours along
7544,S. M. A.,"That whisper may vibrate,"
7545,S. M. A.,"And, like a wizard's song,"
7546,S. M. A.,Decide our ev'ry fate.
7547,S. M. A.,
7548,S. M. A.,"Sometimes a sudden look,"
7549,S. M. A.,"That falleth from some face,"
7550,S. M. A.,Will steal into each nook
7551,S. M. A.,"Of life, and leave its trace;"
7552,S. M. A.,"To haunt us to the last,"
7553,S. M. A.,And sway our ev'ry will

7558,S. M. A.,Sometimes one minute folds
7559,S. M. A.,"The hearts of all the years,"
7560,S. M. A.,Just like the heart that holds
7561,S. M. A.,The Infinite in tears;
7562,S. M. A.,There be such thing as this --
7563,S. M. A.,"Who knoweth why, or how?"

7583,M * * *,
7584,M * * *,You must not weep; I believe I'd hear your tears
7585,M * * *,Tho' sleeping in a tomb:
7586,M * * *,"My rest would not be rest, if in your years"

7588,M * * *,
7589,M * * *,"For -- from the first -- your soul was dear to mine,"

7591,M * * *,"Until my soul, in every prayer, would twine"
7592,M * * *,Thy name -- my child! thy name.

7594,M * * *,"You came to me in girlhood pure and fair,"
7595,M * * *,And in your soul -- and face --
7596,M * * *,I saw a likeness to another there
7597,M * * *,In every trace and grace.
7598,M * * *,
7599,M * * *,You came to me in girlhood -- and you brought
7600,M * * *,An image back to me;
7601,M * * *,No matter what -- or whose -- I often sought
7602,M * * *,Another's soul in thee.
7603,M * * *,
7604,M * * *,"Didst ever mark how, sometimes, I became --"
7605,M * * *,Gentle though I be --
7606,M * * *,"Gentler than ever when I called thy name,"
7607,M * * *,Gentlest to thee?
7608,M * * *,
7609,M * * *,You came to me in girlhood; as your guide
7610,M * * *,I watched your spirit's ways;
7611,M * * *,"We walked God's holy valleys side by side,"
7612,M * * *,And so went on the days.
7613,M * * *,
7614,M * * *,And so went on the years -- 'tis five and more;
7615,M * * *,Your soul is fairer now;
7616,M * * *,A light as of a sunset on a shore
7617,M * * *,Is falling on my brow --
7618,M * * *,
7619,M * * *,"Is falling, soon to fade; when I am dead"
7620,M * * *,"Think this, my child, of me:"
7621,M * * *,I never said -- I never could have said --
7622,M * * *,Ungentle words to thee.
7623,M * * *,
7624,M * * *,"I treated you as I would treat a flower,"
7625,M * * *,I watched you with such care;
7626,M * * *,And from my lips God heard in many an hour
7627,M * * *,Your name in many a prayer.
7628,M * * *,
7629,M * * *,"I watched the flower's growth; so fair it grew,"
7630,M * * *,On not a leaf a stain;
7631,M * * *,Your soul to purest thoughts so sweetly true;
7632,M * * *,I did not watch in vain.
7633,M * * *,
7634,M * * *,I guide you still -- in my steps you tread still;
7635,M * * *,Towards God these ways are set;
7636,M * * *,'Twill soon be over:  child! when I am dead

7638,M * * *,
7639,M * * *,"'Tis better far that I should go before,"
7640,M * * *,And you awhile should stay;
7641,M * * *,But I will wait upon the golden shore
7642,M * * *,To meet my child some day.
7643,M * * *,
7644,M * * *,"When I am dead; in some lone after time,"

7647,M * * *,"""He holds a crown for me."""
7648,M * * *,
7649,M * * *,I guide you here -- I go before you there;
7650,M * * *,But here or there -- I know --
7651,M * * *,"Whether the roses, or the thorny crown you wear"
7652,M * * *,"I'll watch where'er you go,"
7653,M * * *,
7654,M * * *,And wait until you come; when I am dead
7655,M * * *,"Think, sometimes, child, of this:"
7656,M * * *,"You must not weep -- follow where I led,"
7657,M * * *,I wait for you in bliss.

7663,M * * *,
7664,M * * *,
7665,M * * *,
7666,M * * *,Deep in the dark I hear the feet of God:
7667,M * * *,He walks the world; He puts His holy hand
7668,M * * *,On every sleeper -- only puts His hand --
7669,M * * *,Within it benedictions for each one --
7670,M * * *,Then passes on; but ah! whene'er He meets
7671,M * * *,"A watcher waiting for Him, He is glad."
7672,M * * *,"(Does God, like man, feel lonely in the dark?)"
7673,M * * *,He rests His hand upon the watcher's brow --
7674,M * * *,"But more than that, He leaves His very breath"
7675,M * * *,"Upon the watcher's soul; and more than this,"
7676,M * * *,He stays for holy hours where watchers pray;
7677,M * * *,"And more than that, He ofttimes lifts the veils"
7678,M * * *,That hide the visions of the world unseen.
7679,M * * *,The brightest sanctities of highest souls
7680,M * * *,Have blossomed into beauty in the dark.
7681,M * * *,How extremes meet! the very darkest crimes
7682,M * * *,That blight the souls of men are strangely born
7683,M * * *,Beneath the shadows of the holy night.
7684,M * * *,
7685,M * * *,Deep in the dark I hear his holy feet --
7686,M * * *,Around Him rustle archangelic wings;
7687,M * * *,He lingers by the temple where His Christ
7688,M * * *,Is watching in His Eucharistic sleep;
7689,M * * *,"And where poor hearts in sorrow cannot rest,"
7690,M * * *,He lingers there to soothe their weariness.
7691,M * * *,"Where mothers weep above the dying child,"
7692,M * * *,"He stays to bless the mother's bitter tears,"
7693,M * * *,"And consecrates the cradle of her child,"
7694,M * * *,Which is to her her spirit's awful cross.
7695,M * * *,He shudders past the haunts of sin -- yet leaves
7696,M * * *,E'er there a mercy for the wayward hearts.
7697,M * * *,"Still as a shadow through the night He moves,"
7698,M * * *,"With hands all full of blessings, and with heart"
7699,M * * *,"All full of everlasting love; ah, me!"
7700,M * * *,How God does love this poor and sinful world!
7701,M * * *,
7702,M * * *,"The stars behold Him as He passes on,"
7703,M * * *,And arch His path of mercy with their rays;
7704,M * * *,"The stars are grateful -- He gave them their light,"
7705,M * * *,And now they give Him back the light He gave.
7706,M * * *,The shadows tremble in adoring awe;
7707,M * * *,"They feel His presence, and they know His face."
7708,M * * *,"The shadows, too, are grateful -- could they pray,"
7709,M * * *,How they would flower all His way with prayers!
7710,M * * *,The sleeping trees wake up from all their dreams --
7711,M * * *,"Were their leaves lips, ah, me! how they would sing"
7712,M * * *,"A grand Magnificat, as His Mary sang."
7713,M * * *,The lowly grasses and the fair-faced flowers
7714,M * * *,"Watch their Creator as He passes on,"
7715,M * * *,"And mourn they have no hearts to love their God,"
7716,M * * *,And sigh they have no souls to be beloved.
7717,M * * *,Man -- only man -- the image of his God --
7718,M * * *,Lets God pass by when He walks forth at night.

7724,M * * *,
7725,M * * *,
7726,M * * *,
7727,M * * *,Poets are strange -- not always understood
7728,M * * *,"By many is their gift,"
7729,M * * *,Which is for evil or for mighty good --
7730,M * * *,To lower or to lift.
7731,M * * *,
7732,M * * *,Upon their spirits there hath come a breath;
7733,M * * *,Who reads their verse
7734,M * * *,"Will rise to higher life, or taste of death"
7735,M * * *,In blessing or in curse.
7736,M * * *,
7737,M * * *,"The Poet is great Nature's own high priest,"
7738,M * * *,Ordained from very birth
7739,M * * *,To keep for hearts an everlasting feast --
7740,M * * *,To bless or curse the earth.
7741,M * * *,
7742,M * * *,They cannot help but sing; they know not why
7743,M * * *,"Their thoughts rush into song,"
7744,M * * *,"And float above the world, beneath the sky,"
7745,M * * *,For right or for the wrong.
7746,M * * *,
7747,M * * *,"They are like angels -- but some angels fell,"
7748,M * * *,While some did keep their place;
7749,M * * *,"Their poems are the gates of heav'n or hell,"
7750,M * * *,And God's or Satan's face
7751,M * * *,
7752,M * * *,"Looks thro' their ev'ry word into your face,"
7753,M * * *,"In blessing or in blight,"
7754,M * * *,And leaves upon your soul a grace or trace
7755,M * * *,Of sunlight or of night.
7756,M * * *,
7757,M * * *,"They move along life's uttermost extremes,"
7758,M * * *,Unlike all other men;
7759,M * * *,"And in their spirit's depths sleep strangest dreams,"
7760,M * * *,Like shadows in a glen.
7761,M * * *,
7762,M * * *,They all are dreamers; in the day and night
7763,M * * *,Ever across their souls
7764,M * * *,The wondrous mystery of the dark or bright
7765,M * * *,In mystic rhythm rolls.
7766,M * * *,
7767,M * * *,They live within themselves -- they may not tell
7768,M * * *,What lieth deepest there;
7769,M * * *,"Within their breast a heaven or a hell,"
7770,M * * *,Joy or tormenting care.
7771,M * * *,
7772,M * * *,"They are the loneliest men that walk men's ways,"
7773,M * * *,No matter what they seem;
7774,M * * *,The stars and sunlight of their nights and days
7775,M * * *,Move over them in dream.
7776,M * * *,
7777,M * * *,They breathe it forth -- their very spirit's breath --
7778,M * * *,To bless the world or blight;
7779,M * * *,To bring to men a higher life or death;
7780,M * * *,To give them light or night.
7781,M * * *,
7782,M * * *,"The words of some command the world's acclaim,"
7783,M * * *,"And never pass away,"
7784,M * * *,"While others' words receive no palm from fame,"
7785,M * * *,And live but for a day.
7786,M * * *,
7787,M * * *,"But, live or die, their words leave their impress"
7788,M * * *,"Fore'er or for an hour,"
7789,M * * *,And mark men's souls -- some more and some the less --
7790,M * * *,With good's or evil's power.

7795,M * * *,A Legend
7796,M * * *,
7797,M * * *,
7798,M * * *,
7799,M * * *,"He walked alone beside the lonely sea,"
7800,M * * *,"The slanting sunbeams fell upon his face,"
7801,M * * *,His shadow fluttered on the pure white sands
7802,M * * *,Like the weary wing of a soundless prayer.
7803,M * * *,"And He was, oh! so beautiful and fair!"
7804,M * * *,"Brown sandals on His feet -- His face downcast,"
7805,M * * *,As if He loved the earth more than the heav'ns.
7806,M * * *,His face looked like His Mother's -- only hers
7807,M * * *,Had not those strange serenities and stirs
7808,M * * *,That paled or flushed His olive cheeks and brow.
7809,M * * *,He wore the seamless robe His Mother made --
7810,M * * *,"And as He gathered it about His breast,"
7811,M * * *,The wavelets heard a sweet and gentle voice
7812,M * * *,"Murmur, ""Oh! My Mother"" -- the white sands felt"
7813,M * * *,The touch of tender tears He wept the while.
7814,M * * *,He walked beside the sea; He took His sandals off
7815,M * * *,To bathe His weary feet in the pure cool wave --
7816,M * * *,For He had walked across the desert sands
7817,M * * *,All day long -- and as He bathed His feet
7818,M * * *,"He murmured to Himself, ""Three years! three years!"
7819,M * * *,"And then, poor feet, the cruel nails will come"
7820,M * * *,"And make you bleed; but, ah! that blood shall lave"
7821,M * * *,"All weary feet on all their thorny ways."""
7822,M * * *,"""Three years! three years!"" He murmured still again,"
7823,M * * *,"""Ah! would it were to-morrow, but a will --"
7824,M * * *,"My Father's will -- biddeth Me bide that time."""
7825,M * * *,A little fisher-boy came up the shore
7826,M * * *,"And saw Him -- and, nor bold, nor shy,"
7827,M * * *,"Approached, but when he saw the weary face,"
7828,M * * *,"Said mournfully to Him:  ""You look a-tired."""
7829,M * * *,He placed His hand upon the boy's brown brow
7830,M * * *,Caressingly and blessingly -- and said:
7831,M * * *,"""I am so tired to wait.""  The boy spake not."
7832,M * * *,"Sudden, a sea-bird, driven by a storm"
7833,M * * *,"That had been sweeping on the farther shore,"
7834,M * * *,"Came fluttering towards Him, and, panting, fell"
7835,M * * *,At His feet and died; and then the boy said:
7836,M * * *,"""Poor little bird,"" in such a piteous tone;"
7837,M * * *,"He took the bird and laid it in His hand,"
7838,M * * *,And breathed on it -- when to his amaze
7839,M * * *,The little fisher-boy beheld the bird
7840,M * * *,Flutter a moment and then fly aloft --
7841,M * * *,Its little life returned; and then he gazed
7842,M * * *,With look intensest on the wondrous face
7843,M * * *,(Ah! it was beautiful and fair) -- and said:
7844,M * * *,"""Thou art so sweet I wish Thou wert my God."""
7845,M * * *,He leaned down towards the boy and softly said:
7846,M * * *,"""I am thy Christ.""  The day they followed Him,"
7847,M * * *,"With cross upon His shoulders, to His death,"
7848,M * * *,Within the shadow of a shelt'ring rock
7849,M * * *,"That little boy knelt down, and there adored,"
7850,M * * *,"While others cursed, the thorn-crowned Crucified."

7868,M * * *,
7869,M * * *,"We never know each other here,"
7870,M * * *,No soul can here another see --

8299,C.S.A.,"Oh! 'twas sweet, while wreathes of incense"
8300,C.S.A.,"Curled, and countless tapers glowed."
8301,C.S.A.,
8302,C.S.A.,Oh! 'twas grand! that hymn of glory
8303,C.S.A.,Earthly sounds cannot compare;
8304,C.S.A.,"Oh! 'twas grand! it breath'd of heaven,"
8305,C.S.A.,As the angels sung it there.
8306,C.S.A.,"Ravished by the strains ecstatic,"
8307,C.S.A.,"Raptured by the vision grand,"
8308,C.S.A.,"Gazed the pilgrim on the altar,"
8309,C.S.A.,Gazed upon the angel band.
8310,C.S.A.,
8311,C.S.A.,All was hushed! the floating echoes
8312,C.S.A.,Of the hymn had died away;
8313,C.S.A.,"Vanished were the clouds of incense,"
8314,C.S.A.,And the censers ceased to sway.
8315,C.S.A.,"Lo! their wings are gently waving,"
8316,C.S.A.,"And the angels softly rise,"
8317,C.S.A.,"Bending towards the tabernacle,"
8318,C.S.A.,Worship beaming from their eyes.
8319,C.S.A.,
8320,C.S.A.,"One last, lowly genuflection!"
8321,C.S.A.,From their brows love burning shone --
8322,C.S.A.,"Ah! they're going, they've departed,"
8323,C.S.A.,"All but one, the brightest one."
8324,C.S.A.,"""Why remains he?"" thought the pilgrim,"
8325,C.S.A.,Ah! he rises beauteously --
8326,C.S.A.,"""Listen!"" and the angel murmured"
8327,C.S.A.,"Sweetly:  ""Pilgrim, hail to thee!"""
8328,C.S.A.,
8329,C.S.A.,"""Come unto the golden altar,"
8330,C.S.A.,I'm an angel -- banish fear --
8331,C.S.A.,"Come, unite in adoration"
8332,C.S.A.,"With me, for our God is here."
8333,C.S.A.,"Come thy Jesus here reposes,"
8334,C.S.A.,Come! He'll bless thy mortal sight --
8335,C.S.A.,Come! adore the Infant Saviour
8336,C.S.A.,"With me -- for 'tis Christmas night."""
8337,C.S.A.,
8338,C.S.A.,"Now approached the pilgrim, trembling,"
8339,C.S.A.,"Now beside the angel bent,"
8340,C.S.A.,"And the deepest, blissful gladness,"
8341,C.S.A.,With his fervent worship blent.
8342,C.S.A.,"""Pilgrim,"" said the spirit, softly,"
8343,C.S.A.,"""Thou hast seen bright angels here,"
8344,C.S.A.,"And hast heard our sacred anthems,"
8345,C.S.A.,"Filled with rapture, filled with fear."
8346,C.S.A.,
8347,C.S.A.,"""We are twelve -- 'twas we who chanted"
8348,C.S.A.,"First the Saviour's lowly birth,"
8349,C.S.A.,We who brought the joyful tidings
8350,C.S.A.,"Of His coming, to the earth;"
8351,C.S.A.,"We who sung unto the shepherds,"
8352,C.S.A.,"Watching on the mountain height,"
8353,C.S.A.,That the Word was made Incarnate
8354,C.S.A.,For them on that blessed night.
8355,C.S.A.,
8356,C.S.A.,"""And since then we love to linger"
8357,C.S.A.,On that festal night on earth;
8358,C.S.A.,And we leave our thrones of glory
8359,C.S.A.,Here to keep the Saviour's birth.
8360,C.S.A.,Happy mortals! happy mortals!
8361,C.S.A.,To-night the angels would be men;
8362,C.S.A.,"And they leave their thrones in heaven,"
8363,C.S.A.,"For the Crib of Bethlehem."""
8364,C.S.A.,
8365,C.S.A.,And the angel led the pilgrim
8366,C.S.A.,To the tabernacle door;
8367,C.S.A.,"Lo! an Infant there was sleeping,"
8368,C.S.A.,"And the angel said:  ""Adore!"
8369,C.S.A.,"He is sleeping, yet he watches,"
8370,C.S.A.,See that beam of love divine;
8371,C.S.A.,Pilgrim! pay your worship holy
8372,C.S.A.,"To your Infant God and mine."""
8373,C.S.A.,
8374,C.S.A.,"And the spirit slowly, slowly,"
8375,C.S.A.,"Closed the tabernacle door,"
8376,C.S.A.,"While the pilgrim lowly, lowly,"
8377,C.S.A.,Bent in rapture to adore.
8378,C.S.A.,"""Pilgrim,"" spoke the angel sweetly,"
8379,C.S.A.,"""I must bid thee my adieu;"
8380,C.S.A.,"Love! oh! love the Infant Jesus! --"""
8381,C.S.A.,And he vanished from his view.
8382,C.S.A.,
8383,C.S.A.,*    *    *    *    *
8384,C.S.A.,
8385,C.S.A.,All was silent -- silent -- silent --
8386,C.S.A.,Faded was the vision bright --
8387,C.S.A.,But the pilgrim long remembered
8388,C.S.A.,In his heart that Christmas night.
8389,C.S.A.,
8390,C.S.A.,
8391,C.S.A.,
8392,C.S.A.,
8393,C.S.A.,"A Reverie [""Those hearts of ours -- how strange! how strange!""]"
8394,C.S.A.,
8395,C.S.A.,
8396,C.S.A.,
8397,C.S.A.,Those hearts of ours -- how strange! how strange!
8398,C.S.A.,How they yearn to ramble and love to range
8399,C.S.A.,"Down through the vales of the years long gone,"
8400,C.S.A.,Up through the future that fast rolls on.
8401,C.S.A.,
8402,C.S.A.,To-days are dull -- so they wend their ways
8403,C.S.A.,Back to their beautiful yesterdays;
8404,C.S.A.,The present is blank -- so they wing their flight
8405,C.S.A.,To future to-morrows where all seems bright.
8406,C.S.A.,
8407,C.S.A.,"Build them a bright and beautiful home,"
8408,C.S.A.,They'll soon grow weary and want to roam;
8409,C.S.A.,"Find them a spot without sorrow or pain,"
8410,C.S.A.,"They may stay a day, but they're off again."
8411,C.S.A.,
8412,C.S.A.,Those hearts of ours -- how wild! how wild!
8413,C.S.A.,They're as hard to tame as an Indian child;
8414,C.S.A.,"They're as restless as waves on the sounding sea,"
8415,C.S.A.,Like the breeze and the bird are they fickle and free.
8416,C.S.A.,
8417,C.S.A.,Those hearts of ours -- how lone! how lone!
8418,C.S.A.,"Ever, forever, they mourn and moan;"
8419,C.S.A.,"Let them revel in joy, let them riot in cheer;"
8420,C.S.A.,"The revelry o'er, they're all the more drear."
8421,C.S.A.,
8422,C.S.A.,Those hearts of ours -- how warm! how warm!
8423,C.S.A.,"Like the sun's bright rays, like the Summer's charm;"
8424,C.S.A.,How they beam and burn! how they gleam and glow
8425,C.S.A.,Their flash and flame hide but ashes below.
8426,C.S.A.,
8427,C.S.A.,Those hearts of ours -- how cold! how cold!
8428,C.S.A.,Like December's snow on the waste or wold;
8429,C.S.A.,"And though our Decembers melt soon into May,"
8430,C.S.A.,Hearts know Decembers that pass not away.
8431,C.S.A.,
8432,C.S.A.,Those hearts of ours -- how deep! how deep!
8433,C.S.A.,"You may sound the sea where the corals sleep,"
8434,C.S.A.,Where never a billow hath rumbled or rolled --
8435,C.S.A.,Depths still the deeper our hearts hide and hold.
8436,C.S.A.,
8437,C.S.A.,Where the wild storm's tramp hath ne'er been known
8438,C.S.A.,The wrecks of the sea lie low and lone;
8439,C.S.A.,"Thus the heart's surface may sparkle and glow,"
8440,C.S.A.,There are wrecks far down -- there are graves below.
8441,C.S.A.,
8442,C.S.A.,"Those hearts of ours -- but, after all,"
8443,C.S.A.,"How shallow and narrow, how tiny and small;"
8444,C.S.A.,"Like scantiest streamlet or Summer's least rill,"
8445,C.S.A.,They're as easy to empty -- as easy to fill.
8446,C.S.A.,
8447,C.S.A.,One hour of storm and how the streams pour!
8448,C.S.A.,One hour of sun and the streams are no more;
8449,C.S.A.,One little grief -- how the tears gush and glide!
8450,C.S.A.,"One smile -- flow they ever so fast, they are dried."
8451,C.S.A.,
8452,C.S.A.,Those hearts of ours -- how wise! how wise!
8453,C.S.A.,They can lift their thoughts till they touch the skies;
8454,C.S.A.,"They can sink their shafts, like a miner bold,"
8455,C.S.A.,Where wisdom's mines hide their pearls and gold.
8456,C.S.A.,
8457,C.S.A.,"Aloft they soar with undazzled gaze,"
8458,C.S.A.,Where the halls of the Day-King burn and blaze;
8459,C.S.A.,"Or they fly with a wing that will never fail,"
8460,C.S.A.,O'er the sky's dark sea where the star-ships sail.
8461,C.S.A.,
8462,C.S.A.,Those hearts of ours -- what fools! what fools!
8463,C.S.A.,"How they laugh at wisdom, her cant and rules!"
8464,C.S.A.,"How they waste their powers, and, when wasted, grieve"
8465,C.S.A.,"For what they have squandered, but cannot retrieve."
8466,C.S.A.,
8467,C.S.A.,Those hearts of ours -- how strong! how strong!
8468,C.S.A.,"Let a thousand sorrows around them throng,"
8469,C.S.A.,"They can bear them all, and a thousand more,"
8470,C.S.A.,And they're stronger then than they were before.
8471,C.S.A.,
8472,C.S.A.,Those hearts of ours -- how weak! how weak!
8473,C.S.A.,"But a single word of unkindness speak,"
8474,C.S.A.,"Like a poisoned shaft, like a viper's fang,"
8475,C.S.A.,That one slight word leaves a life-long pang.
8476,C.S.A.,
8477,C.S.A.,"Those hearts of ours -- but I've said enough,"
8478,C.S.A.,As I find that my rhyme grows rude and rough;
8479,C.S.A.,"I'll rest me now, but I'll come again"
8480,C.S.A.,"Some other day, to resume my strain."
8481,C.S.A.,
8482,C.S.A.,
8483,C.S.A.,
8484,C.S.A.,
8485,C.S.A.,---- Their Story Runneth Thus
8486,C.S.A.,
8487,C.S.A.,
8488,C.S.A.,
8489,C.S.A.,"Two little children played among the flowers,"
8490,C.S.A.,"Their mothers were of kin, tho' far apart;"
8491,C.S.A.,The children's ages were the very same
8492,C.S.A.,"E'en to an hour -- and Ethel was her name,"
8493,C.S.A.,"A fair, sweet girl, with great, brown, wond'ring eyes"
8494,C.S.A.,That seemed to listen just as if they held
8495,C.S.A.,The gift of hearing with the power of sight.
8496,C.S.A.,"Six summers slept upon her low white brow,"
8497,C.S.A.,And dreamed amid the roses of her cheeks.
8498,C.S.A.,Her voice was sweetly low; and when she spoke
8499,C.S.A.,Her words were music; and her laughter rang
8500,C.S.A.,"So like an altar-bell that, had you heard"
8501,C.S.A.,"Its silvery sound a-ringing, you would think"
8502,C.S.A.,Of kneeling down and worshiping the pure.
8503,C.S.A.,
8504,C.S.A.,They played among the roses -- it was May --
8505,C.S.A.,"And ""hide and seek"", and ""seek and hide"", all eve"
8506,C.S.A.,They played together till the sun went down.
8507,C.S.A.,Earth held no happier hearts than theirs that day:
8508,C.S.A.,And tired at last she plucked a crimson rose
8509,C.S.A.,"And gave to him, her playmate, cousin-kin;"
8510,C.S.A.,And he went thro' the garden till he found
8511,C.S.A.,"The whitest rose of all the roses there,"
8512,C.S.A.,"And placed it in her long, brown, waving hair."
8513,C.S.A.,"""I give you red -- and you -- you give me white:"
8514,C.S.A.,"What is the meaning?"" said she, while a smile,"
8515,C.S.A.,"As radiant as the light of angels' wings,"
8516,C.S.A.,Swept bright across her face; the while her eyes
8517,C.S.A.,Seemed infinite purities half asleep
8518,C.S.A.,In sweetest pearls; and he did make reply:
8519,C.S.A.,"""Sweet Ethel! white dies first; you know, the snow,"
8520,C.S.A.,(And it is not as white as thy pure face)
8521,C.S.A.,Melts soon away; but roses red as mine
8522,C.S.A.,"Will bloom when all the snow hath passed away."""
8523,C.S.A.,
8524,C.S.A.,"She sighed a little sigh, then laughed again,"
8525,C.S.A.,And hand in hand they walked the winding ways
8526,C.S.A.,Of that fair garden till they reached her home.
8527,C.S.A.,A good-bye and a kiss -- and he was gone.
8528,C.S.A.,
8529,C.S.A.,"She leaned her head upon her mother's breast,"
8530,C.S.A.,"And ere she fell asleep she, sighing, called:"
8531,C.S.A.,"""Does white die first? my mother! and does red"
8532,C.S.A.,"Live longer?""  And her mother wondered much"
8533,C.S.A.,At such strange speech.  She fell asleep
8534,C.S.A.,With murmurs on her lips of red and white.
8535,C.S.A.,
8536,C.S.A.,Those children loved as only children can --
8537,C.S.A.,With nothing in their love save their whole selves.
8538,C.S.A.,When in their cradles they had been betroth'd;
8539,C.S.A.,They knew it in a manner vague and dim --
8540,C.S.A.,Unconscious yet of what betrothal meant.
8541,C.S.A.,
8542,C.S.A.,The boy -- she called him Merlin -- a love name --
8543,C.S.A.,"(And he -- he called her always Ullainee,"
8544,C.S.A.,No matter why); the boy was full of moods.
8545,C.S.A.,Upon his soul and face the dark and bright
8546,C.S.A.,Were strangely intermingled.  Hours would pass
8547,C.S.A.,"Rippling with his bright prattle; and then, hours"
8548,C.S.A.,"Would come and go, and never hear a word"
8549,C.S.A.,"Fall from his lips, and never see a smile"
8550,C.S.A.,Upon his face.  He was so like a cloud
8551,C.S.A.,"With ever-changeful hues, as she was like"
8552,C.S.A.,A golden sunbeam shining on its face.
8553,C.S.A.,
8554,C.S.A.,*    *    *    *    *
8555,C.S.A.,
8556,C.S.A.,Ten years passed on.  They parted and they met
8557,C.S.A.,Not often in each year; yet as they grew
8558,C.S.A.,"In years, a consciousness unto them came"
8559,C.S.A.,Of human love.
8560,C.S.A.,But it was sweet and pure.
8561,C.S.A.,"There was no passion in it.  Reverence,"
8562,C.S.A.,"Like Guardian-Angel, watched o'er Innocence."
8563,C.S.A.,
8564,C.S.A.,One night in mid of May their faces met
8565,C.S.A.,As pure as all the stars that gazed on them.
8566,C.S.A.,They met to part from themselves and the world;
8567,C.S.A.,Their hearts just touched to separate and bleed;
8568,C.S.A.,"Their eyes were linked in look, while saddest tears"
8569,C.S.A.,"Fell down, like rain, upon the cheeks of each:"
8570,C.S.A.,They were to meet no more.
8571,C.S.A.,Their hands were clasped
8572,C.S.A.,To tear the clasp in twain; and all the stars
8573,C.S.A.,"Looked proudly down on them, while shadows knelt,"
8574,C.S.A.,"Or seemed to kneel, around them with the awe"
8575,C.S.A.,Evoked from any heart by sacrifice.
8576,C.S.A.,And in the heart of that last parting hour
8577,C.S.A.,Eternity was beating.  And he said:
8578,C.S.A.,"""We part to go to Calvary and to God --"
8579,C.S.A.,This is our garden of Gethsemane;
8580,C.S.A.,And here we bow our heads and breathe His prayer
8581,C.S.A.,"Whose heart was bleeding, while the angels heard:"
8582,C.S.A.,"Not my will, Father! but Thine own be done."""
8583,C.S.A.,Raptures meet agonies in such heart-hours;
8584,C.S.A.,"Gladness doth often fling her bright, warm arms"
8585,C.S.A.,"Around the cold, white neck of grief -- and thus"
8586,C.S.A.,The while they parted -- sorrow swept their hearts
8587,C.S.A.,"Like a great, dark stormy sea -- but sudden"
8588,C.S.A.,"A joy, like sunshine -- did it come from God? --"
8589,C.S.A.,
8590,C.S.A.,Flung over every wave that swept o'er them
8591,C.S.A.,A more than golden glory.
8592,C.S.A.,Merlin said:
8593,C.S.A.,"""Our loves must soar aloft to spheres divine;"
8594,C.S.A.,"The human satisfies nor you nor me,"
8595,C.S.A.,(No human love shall ever satisfy --
8596,C.S.A.,Or ever did -- the hearts that lean on it);
8597,C.S.A.,"You sigh for something higher as do I,"
8598,C.S.A.,"So let our spirits be espoused in God,"
8599,C.S.A.,And let our wedlock be as soul to soul;
8600,C.S.A.,"And prayer shall be the golden marriage ring,"
8601,C.S.A.,"And God will bless us both."""
8602,C.S.A.,She sweetly said:
8603,C.S.A.,"""Your words are echoes of my own soul's thoughts;"
8604,C.S.A.,Let God's own heart be our own holy home
8605,C.S.A.,And let us live as only angels live;
8606,C.S.A.,And let us love as our own angels love.
8607,C.S.A.,'Tis hard to part -- but it is better so --
8608,C.S.A.,"God's will is ours, and -- Merlin! let us go."""
8609,C.S.A.,
8610,C.S.A.,And then she sobbed as if her heart would break --
8611,C.S.A.,"Perhaps it did; an awful minute passed,"
8612,C.S.A.,Long as an age and briefer than a flash
8613,C.S.A.,Of lightning in the skies.  No word was said --
8614,C.S.A.,Only a look which never was forgot.
8615,C.S.A.,Between them fell the shadows of the night.
8616,C.S.A.,"Their faces went away into the dark,"
8617,C.S.A.,And never met again; and yet their souls
8618,C.S.A.,Were twined together in the heart of Christ.
8619,C.S.A.,
8620,C.S.A.,And Ethel went from earthland long ago;
8621,C.S.A.,But Merlin stays still hanging on his cross.
8622,C.S.A.,"He would not move a nail that nails him there,"
8623,C.S.A.,He would not pluck a thorn that crowns him there.
8624,C.S.A.,He hung himself upon the blessed cross
8625,C.S.A.,With Ethel; she has gone to wear the crown
8626,C.S.A.,That wreathes the brows of virgins who have kept
8627,C.S.A.,Their bodies with their souls from earthly taint.
8628,C.S.A.,
8629,C.S.A.,"And years and years, and weary years, passed on"
8630,C.S.A.,"Into the past.  One Autumn afternoon,"
8631,C.S.A.,"When flowers were in their agony of death,"
8632,C.S.A.,"And winds sang ""De Profundis"" over them,"
8633,C.S.A.,"And skies were sad with shadows, he did walk"
8634,C.S.A.,"Where, in a resting place as calm as sweet,"
8635,C.S.A.,The dead were lying down; the Autumn sun
8636,C.S.A.,Was half way down the west; the hour was three --
8637,C.S.A.,"The holiest hour of all the twenty-four,"
8638,C.S.A.,"For Jesus leaned His head on it, and died."
8639,C.S.A.,He walked alone amid the virgin's graves
8640,C.S.A.,"Where virgins slept; a convent stood near by,"
8641,C.S.A.,And from the solitary cells of nuns
8642,C.S.A.,Unto the cells of death the way was short.
8643,C.S.A.,"Low, simple stones and white watched o'er each grave,"
8644,C.S.A.,"While in the hollows 'tween them sweet flowers grew,"
8645,C.S.A.,Entwining grave and grave.  He read the names
8646,C.S.A.,"Engraven on the stones, and ""Rest in peace"""
8647,C.S.A.,"Was written 'neath them all, and o'er each name"
8648,C.S.A.,A cross was graven on the lowly stone.
8649,C.S.A.,"He passed each grave with reverential awe,"
8650,C.S.A.,"As if he passed an altar, where the Host"
8651,C.S.A.,Had left a memory of its sacrifice.
8652,C.S.A.,And o'er the buried virgins' virgin dust
8653,C.S.A.,He walked as prayerfully as tho' he trod
8654,C.S.A.,The holy floor of fair Loretta's shrine.
8655,C.S.A.,"He passed from grave to grave, and read the names"
8656,C.S.A.,Of those whose own pure lips had changed the names
8657,C.S.A.,By which this world had known them into names
8658,C.S.A.,Of sacrifice known only to their God;
8659,C.S.A.,Veiling their faces they had veiled their names;
8660,C.S.A.,"The very ones who played with them as girls,"
8661,C.S.A.,"Had they passed there, would know no more than he"
8662,C.S.A.,Or any stranger where their playmates slept;
8663,C.S.A.,"And then he wondered all about their lives, their hearts,"
8664,C.S.A.,"Their thoughts, their feelings, and their dreams,"
8665,C.S.A.,"Their joys and sorrows, and their smiles and tears."
8666,C.S.A.,He wondered at the stories that were hid
8667,C.S.A.,Forever down within those simple graves.
8668,C.S.A.,In a lone corner of that resting-place
8669,C.S.A.,Uprose a low white slab that marked a grave
8670,C.S.A.,"Apart from all the others; long, sad grass"
8671,C.S.A.,"Drooped o'er the little mound, and mantled it"
8672,C.S.A.,With veil of purest green; around the slab
8673,C.S.A.,The whitest of white roses 'twined their arms --
8674,C.S.A.,Roses cold as the snows and pure as songs
8675,C.S.A.,Of angels -- and the pale leaflets and thorns
8676,C.S.A.,Hid e'en the very name of her who slept
8677,C.S.A.,"Beneath.  He walked on to the grave, but when"
8678,C.S.A.,He reached its side a spell fell on his heart
8679,C.S.A.,So suddenly -- he knew not why -- and tears
8680,C.S.A.,Went up into his eyes and trickled down
8681,C.S.A.,Upon the grass; he was so strangely moved
8682,C.S.A.,As if he met a long-gone face he loved.
8683,C.S.A.,I believe he prayed.  He lifted then the leaves
8684,C.S.A.,"That hid the name; but as he did, the thorns"
8685,C.S.A.,"Did pierce his hand, and lo! amazed, he read"
8686,C.S.A.,"The very word -- the very, very name"
8687,C.S.A.,He gave the girl in golden days before --

8735,"""ULLAINEE"".",He went into a wide and humble room --

8999,"""ULLAINEE"",","""She paused -- a few stray tears had dropped upon"
9000,"""ULLAINEE"",",Her closing words and softened them to sighs.
9001,"""ULLAINEE"",","I listened, inward moved, but outward calm and cold"

9005,"""ULLAINEE"",","It is a heart affair, and in such things"
9006,"""ULLAINEE"",","There's little logic, and there's less of sense."
9007,"""ULLAINEE"",","You brought your heart, dear child, but left your head"

9015,"""ULLAINEE"",","Dost thou do well, Sister, to wound it more?"
9016,"""ULLAINEE"",","If merely warmth of feelings urged me here,"
9017,"""ULLAINEE"",",Dost thou do well to chill them into ice?

9029,"""ULLAINEE"",",And then she sobbed outright

9033,"""ULLAINEE"",","If thou art called of God, thou yet shalt come"
9034,"""ULLAINEE"",",And find e'en here a home.  But God is slow

9087,"""ULLAINEE"",",She seemed to have rapt moments -- then she grew
9088,"""ULLAINEE"",","Absent-minded, and would come and ask me"
9089,"""ULLAINEE"",",To walk alone and say her Rosary
9090,"""ULLAINEE"",",Beneath the trees.  She had a voice divine;
9091,"""ULLAINEE"",","And when she sang for us, in truth it seemed"

9093,"""ULLAINEE"",","The dower of her mind as of her heart,"
9094,"""ULLAINEE"",","Was of the richest, and she mastered art"

9096,"""ULLAINEE"",",Moved ceaselessly amid the beautiful.
9097,"""ULLAINEE"",",There is a picture hanging in our choir

9109,"""ULLAINEE"",",
9110,"""ULLAINEE"",","""In every May for two whole days she kept"

9129,"""ULLAINEE"",","The angel's cell would lightly tread, and breathe"
9130,"""ULLAINEE"",",A prayer that death might pass the angel by
9131,"""ULLAINEE"",","And let her longer stay, for she lay ill --"

9133,"""ULLAINEE"",",Ah! many were the orisons that rose

9138,"""ULLAINEE"",","Perhaps too much we loved her, and perhaps"
9139,"""ULLAINEE"",",Our love was far too human.  Slow and slow
9140,"""ULLAINEE"",",She faded like a flower.  And slow and slow
9141,"""ULLAINEE"",",Her pale cheeks whitened more.  And slow and slow
9142,"""ULLAINEE"",","Her large, brown, wondering eyes sank deep and dim."
9143,"""ULLAINEE"",",Hope died on all our faces; but on her's
9144,"""ULLAINEE"",","Another and a different hope did shine,"
9145,"""ULLAINEE"",",And from her wasted lips sweet prayers arose
9146,"""ULLAINEE"",",That made her watchers weep.  Fast came the end.
9147,"""ULLAINEE"",",Never such silence o'er the cloister hung --
9148,"""ULLAINEE"",","We walked more softly, and, whene'er we spoke,"
9149,"""ULLAINEE"",","Our voices fell to whispers, lest a sound"
9150,"""ULLAINEE"",",Might jar upon her ear.  The sisters watched
9151,"""ULLAINEE"",",In turns beside her couch; to each she gave
9152,"""ULLAINEE"",","A gentle word, a smile, a thankful look."
9153,"""ULLAINEE"",",At times her mind did wander; no wild words
9154,"""ULLAINEE"",",Escaped her lips -- she seemed to float away
9155,"""ULLAINEE"",","To far-gone days, and live again in scenes"
9156,"""ULLAINEE"",",Whose hours were bright and happy.  In her sleep
9157,"""ULLAINEE"",","She ofttimes spoke low, gentle, holy words"
9158,"""ULLAINEE"",",About her mother; and sometimes she sang
9159,"""ULLAINEE"",",The fragments of sweet olden songs -- and when
9160,"""ULLAINEE"",","She woke again, she timidly would ask"
9161,"""ULLAINEE"",","If she had spoken in her sleep, and what"

9163,"""ULLAINEE"",",That sleep might open there some long-closed gate
9164,"""ULLAINEE"",","She would keep locked.  And softly as a cloud,"

9166,"""ULLAINEE"",","Floats from the heart of land out o'er the sea,"
9167,"""ULLAINEE"",","So her sweet life was passing.  One bright eve,"
9168,"""ULLAINEE"",","The fourteenth day of August, when the sun"

9170,"""ULLAINEE"",","Around him on descending day's bright throne,"
9171,"""ULLAINEE"",",She sent for me and bade me come in haste.
9172,"""ULLAINEE"",",I went into her cell.  There was a light
9173,"""ULLAINEE"",","Upon her face, unearthly; and it shone"
9174,"""ULLAINEE"",",Like gleam of star upon a dying rose.
9175,"""ULLAINEE"",","I sat beside her couch, and took her hand"
9176,"""ULLAINEE"",","In mine -- a fair, frail hand that scarcely seem'd"
9177,"""ULLAINEE"",","Of flesh -- so wasted, white and wan it was."
9178,"""ULLAINEE"",","Her great, brown, wond'ring eyes had sunk away"
9179,"""ULLAINEE"",",Deep in their sockets -- and their light shone dim
9180,"""ULLAINEE"",",As tapers dying on an altar.  Soft
9181,"""ULLAINEE"",","As a dream of beauty on me fell low,"
9182,"""ULLAINEE"",",Last words.
9183,"""ULLAINEE"",","`Mother, the tide is ebbing fast;"

9187,"""ULLAINEE"",","One favor more, which thou wilt not refuse."
9188,"""ULLAINEE"",","Thou wert a mother to the orphan girl,"
9189,"""ULLAINEE"",","Thou gav'st her heart a home, her love a vase,"
9190,"""ULLAINEE"",","Her weariness a rest, her sacrifice a shrine --"
9191,"""ULLAINEE"",","And thou didst love me, Mother, as she loved"

9196,"""ULLAINEE"",","I'm going from this heaven into that,"

9198,"""ULLAINEE"",",It was the sunset of Our Lady's feast.
9199,"""ULLAINEE"",",My soul passed upwards thro' the golden clouds
9200,"""ULLAINEE"",",To sing the second Vespers of the day

9216,"""ULLAINEE"",","""Ullainee!"" (she spelt the letters out),"
9217,"""ULLAINEE"",",Nor ask me why -- tho' if thou wilt I'll tell;
