172,A LAMENT,
173,A LAMENT,"""The parted spirit,"
174,A LAMENT,Knoweth it not our sorrow? Answereth not
175,A LAMENT,"Its blessing to our tears?"""
176,A LAMENT,
177,A LAMENT,"The circle is broken, one seat is forsaken,"
178,A LAMENT,One bud from the tree of our friendship is shaken;
179,A LAMENT,One heart from among us no longer shall thrill
180,A LAMENT,"With joy in our gladness, or grief in our ill."
181,A LAMENT,
182,A LAMENT,Weep! lonely and lowly are slumbering now
183,A LAMENT,"The light of her glances, the pride of her brow;"
184,A LAMENT,Weep! sadly and long shall we listen in vain
185,A LAMENT,To hear the soft tones of her welcome again.
186,A LAMENT,
187,A LAMENT,Give our tears to the dead! For humanity's claim
188,A LAMENT,From its silence and darkness is ever the same;
189,A LAMENT,The hope of that world whose existence is bliss
190,A LAMENT,May not stifle the tears of the mourners of this.
191,A LAMENT,
192,A LAMENT,"For, oh! if one glance the freed spirit can throw"
193,A LAMENT,"On the scene of its troubled probation below,"
194,A LAMENT,"Than the pride of the marble, the pomp of the dead,"
195,A LAMENT,To that glance will be dearer the tears which we shed.
196,A LAMENT,
197,A LAMENT,"Oh, who can forget the mild light of her smile,"
198,A LAMENT,"Over lips moved with music and feeling the while,"
199,A LAMENT,"The eye's deep enchantment, dark, dream-like, and clear,"
200,A LAMENT,"In the glow of its gladness, the shade of its tear."
201,A LAMENT,
202,A LAMENT,"And the charm of her features, while over the whole"
203,A LAMENT,Played the hues of the heart and the sunshine of soul;
204,A LAMENT,"And the tones of her voice, like the music which seems"
205,A LAMENT,Murmured low in our ears by the Angel of dreams!
206,A LAMENT,
207,A LAMENT,But holier and dearer our memories hold
208,A LAMENT,"Those treasures of feeling, more precious than gold,"
209,A LAMENT,The love and the kindness and pity which gave
210,A LAMENT,"Fresh flowers for the bridal, green wreaths for the grave!"
211,A LAMENT,
212,A LAMENT,"The heart ever open to Charity's claim,"
213,A LAMENT,"Unmoved from its purpose by censure and blame,"
214,A LAMENT,While vainly alike on her eye and her ear
215,A LAMENT,"Fell the scorn of the heartless, the jesting and jeer."
216,A LAMENT,
217,A LAMENT,How true to our hearts was that beautiful sleeper
218,A LAMENT,"With smiles for the joyful, with tears for the weeper,"
219,A LAMENT,"Yet, evermore prompt, whether mournful or gay,"
220,A LAMENT,With warnings in love to the passing astray.
221,A LAMENT,
222,A LAMENT,"For, though spotless herself, she could sorrow for them"
223,A LAMENT,Who sullied with evil the spirit's pure gem;
224,A LAMENT,"And a sigh or a tear could the erring reprove,"
225,A LAMENT,And the sting of reproof was still tempered by love.
226,A LAMENT,
227,A LAMENT,"As a cloud of the sunset, slow melting in heaven,"
228,A LAMENT,"As a star that is lost when the daylight is given,"
229,A LAMENT,"As a glad dream of slumber, which wakens in bliss,"
230,A LAMENT,She hath passed to the world of the holy from this.

1259,TO RONGE.,This was written after reading the powerful and manly protest of
1260,TO RONGE.,"Johannes Ronge against the ""pious fraud"" of the Bishop of Treves."
1261,TO RONGE.,The bold movement of the young Catholic priest of Prussian Silesia
1262,TO RONGE.,seemed to me full of promise to the cause of political as well as
1263,TO RONGE.,religious liberty in Europe. That it failed was due partly to the
1264,TO RONGE.,"faults of the reformer, but mainly to the disagreement of the"
1265,TO RONGE.,"Liberals of Germany upon a matter of dogma, which prevented them"
1266,TO RONGE.,from unity of action. Rouge was born in Silesia in 1813 and died in
1267,TO RONGE.,"October, 1887. His autobiography was translated into English and"

1309,CHANNING.,"his philanthropic labors and liberal political opinions, I visited"
1310,CHANNING.,him in his summer residence in Rhode Island. In recalling the
1311,CHANNING.,"impressions of that visit, it can scarcely be necessary to say,"
1312,CHANNING.,that I have no reference to the peculiar religious opinions of a
1313,CHANNING.,"man whose life, beautifully and truly manifested above the"
1314,CHANNING.,"atmosphere of sect, is now the world's common legacy."
1315,CHANNING.,
1316,CHANNING.,"Not vainly did old poets tell,"
1317,CHANNING.,Nor vainly did old genius paint
1318,CHANNING.,"God's great and crowning miracle,"

1320,CHANNING.,
1321,CHANNING.,For even in a faithless day

1323,CHANNING.,"And feel, while with them on the way,"
1324,CHANNING.,Our hearts within us burn.
1325,CHANNING.,
1326,CHANNING.,And thus the common tongue and pen
1327,CHANNING.,"Which, world-wide, echo Channing's fame,"
1328,CHANNING.,"As one of Heaven's anointed men,"
1329,CHANNING.,Have sanctified his name.

1345,CHANNING.,
1346,CHANNING.,"With us was one, who, calm and true,"
1347,CHANNING.,"Life's highest purpose understood,"

1350,CHANNING.,
1351,CHANNING.,"Unlearned, unknown to lettered fame,"

1356,CHANNING.,"Unknown to power or place, yet where"

1360,CHANNING.,

1369,CHANNING.,The sorrow of the soul.
1370,CHANNING.,
1371,CHANNING.,But when the generous Briton told

1385,CHANNING.,
1386,CHANNING.,"No bars of sect or clime were felt,"
1387,CHANNING.,"The Babel strife of tongues had ceased,"
1388,CHANNING.,And at one common altar knelt
1389,CHANNING.,The Quaker and the priest.
1390,CHANNING.,
1391,CHANNING.,"And not in vain: with strength renewed,"
1392,CHANNING.,"And zeal refreshed, and hope less dim,"
1393,CHANNING.,"For that brief meeting, each pursued"
1394,CHANNING.,The path allotted him.
1395,CHANNING.,
1396,CHANNING.,How echoes yet each Western hill
1397,CHANNING.,And vale with Channing's dying word!
1398,CHANNING.,How are the hearts of freemen still
1399,CHANNING.,By that great warning stirred.
1400,CHANNING.,
1401,CHANNING.,"The stranger treads his native soil,"
1402,CHANNING.,"And pleads, with zeal unfelt before,"

1405,CHANNING.,
1406,CHANNING.,"Before him time-wrought barriers fall,"
1407,CHANNING.,"Old fears subside, old hatreds melt,"
1408,CHANNING.,"And, stretching o'er the sea's blue wall,"

1410,CHANNING.,
1411,CHANNING.,"The yeoman on the Scottish lines,"
1412,CHANNING.,"The Sheffield grinder, worn and grim,"
1413,CHANNING.,"The delver in the Cornwall mines,"

1420,CHANNING.,
1421,CHANNING.,And thus the influence of that hour
1422,CHANNING.,Of converse on Rhode Island's strand

1425,CHANNING.,

1969,ICHABOD,This poem was the outcome of the surprise and grief and forecast of
1970,ICHABOD,evil consequences which I felt on reading the seventh of March
1971,ICHABOD,"speech of Daniel Webster in support of the ""compromise,"" and the"
1972,ICHABOD,Fugitive Slave Law. No partisan or personal enmity dictated it. On
1973,ICHABOD,the contrary my admiration of the splendid personality and
1974,ICHABOD,intellectual power of the great Senator was never stronger than
1975,ICHABOD,"when I laid down his speech, and, in one of the saddest moments of"
1976,ICHABOD,"my life, penned my protest. I saw, as I wrote, with painful"
1977,ICHABOD,"clearness its sure results,--the Slave Power arrogant and defiant,"
1978,ICHABOD,strengthened and encouraged to carry out its scheme for the
1979,ICHABOD,"extension of its baleful system, or the dissolution of the Union,"
1980,ICHABOD,"the guaranties of personal liberty in the free States broken down,"
1981,ICHABOD,and the whole country made the hunting-ground of slave-catchers. In
1982,ICHABOD,"the horror of such a vision, so soon fearfully fulfilled, if one"
1983,ICHABOD,"spoke at all, he could only speak in tones of stern and sorrowful"
1984,ICHABOD,"rebuke. But death softens all resentments, and the consciousness of"
1985,ICHABOD,a common inheritance of frailty and weakness modifies the severity
1986,ICHABOD,"of judgment. Years after, in _The Lost Occasion_ I gave utterance"
1987,ICHABOD,to an almost universal regret that the great statesman did not live
1988,ICHABOD,"to see the flag which he loved trampled under the feet of Slavery,"
1989,ICHABOD,"and, in view of this desecration, make his last days glorious in"
1990,ICHABOD,"defence of ""Liberty and Union, one and inseparable."""
1991,ICHABOD,
1992,ICHABOD,So fallen! so lost! the light withdrawn
1993,ICHABOD,Which once he wore!
1994,ICHABOD,The glory from his gray hairs gone
1995,ICHABOD,Forevermore!
1996,ICHABOD,
1997,ICHABOD,"Revile him not, the Tempter hath"
1998,ICHABOD,A snare for all;
1999,ICHABOD,"And pitying tears, not scorn and wrath,"
2000,ICHABOD,Befit his fall!
2001,ICHABOD,
2002,ICHABOD,"Oh, dumb be passion's stormy rage,"
2003,ICHABOD,When he who might
2004,ICHABOD,"Have lighted up and led his age,"
2005,ICHABOD,Falls back in night.
2006,ICHABOD,
2007,ICHABOD,"Scorn! would the angels laugh, to mark"
2008,ICHABOD,"A bright soul driven,"

2010,ICHABOD,From hope and heaven!
2011,ICHABOD,

2015,ICHABOD,Dishonored brow.
2016,ICHABOD,
2017,ICHABOD,"But let its humbled sons, instead,"
2018,ICHABOD,"From sea to lake,"
2019,ICHABOD,"A long lament, as for the dead,"
2020,ICHABOD,In sadness make.
2021,ICHABOD,
2022,ICHABOD,"Of all we loved and honored, naught"
2023,ICHABOD,Save power remains;
2024,ICHABOD,"A fallen angel's pride of thought,"
2025,ICHABOD,Still strong in chains.
2026,ICHABOD,
2027,ICHABOD,All else is gone; from those great eyes
2028,ICHABOD,The soul has fled
2029,ICHABOD,"When faith is lost, when honor dies,"
