189,A LAY MADE ABOUT THE YEAR OF THE CITY CCCLX.,"last of the early kings of Rome, was driven out of the city, partly"
190,A LAY MADE ABOUT THE YEAR OF THE CITY CCCLX.,"on account of his own tyranny, and partly because of the misdeeds of"
191,A LAY MADE ABOUT THE YEAR OF THE CITY CCCLX.,his son Sextus Tarquin.  The immediate cause of the expulsion of the

197,A LAY MADE ABOUT THE YEAR OF THE CITY CCCLX.,marched upon Rome.  It was then that the incident recorded in the

199,A LAY MADE ABOUT THE YEAR OF THE CITY CCCLX.,"defence of the bridge by Horatius, Lars Porsena laid siege to the"
200,A LAY MADE ABOUT THE YEAR OF THE CITY CCCLX.,"city and at last reduced it to submission.  He did not, however,"

442,XX,"The Consul fixed his eye,"
443,XX,And saw the swarthy storm of dust              160
444,XX,Rise fast along the sky.
445,XX,
446,XX,
447,XXI,XXI
448,XXI,
449,XXI,And nearer fast and nearer
450,XXI,Doth the red whirlwind come;
451,XXI,"And louder still and still more loud,"
452,XXI,"From underneath that rolling cloud,            165"
453,XXI,"Is heard the trumpet's war-note proud,"
454,XXI,"The trampling, and the hum."
455,XXI,And plainly and more plainly
456,XXI,"Now through the gloom appears,"
457,XXI,"Far to left and far to right,                  170"
458,XXI,"In broken gleams of dark-blue light,"
459,XXI,"The long array of helmets bright,"

465,XXII,"And plainly, and more plainly"
466,XXII,"Above that glimmering line,                  175"
467,XXII,Now might ye see the banners
468,XXII,Of twelve fair cities[32] shine;
469,XXII,But the banner of proud Clusium
470,XXII,"Was highest of them all,"
471,XXII,"The terror of the Umbrian,[33]                 180"
472,XXII,The terror of the Gaul.[34]
473,XXII,

480,XXIII,Each warlike Lucumo.[36]                     185
481,XXIII,There Cilnius of Arretium
482,XXIII,On his fleet roan[37] was seen;
483,XXIII,"And Astur of the fourfold shield,[38]"
484,XXIII,Girt with the brand none else may wield;
485,XXIII,"Tolumnius with the belt of gold,               190"

495,XXIV,Sat in his ivory car.
496,XXIV,"By the right wheel rode Mamilius,"
497,XXIV,Prince of the Latian name;
498,XXIV,"And by the left false Sextus,"

504,XXV,But when the face of Sextus
505,XXV,"Was seen among the foes,"
506,XXV,A yell that rent the firmament
507,XXV,From all the town arose.
508,XXV,On the house-tops was no woman                 205
509,XXV,"But spat towards him and hissed,"
510,XXV,"No child but screamed out curses,"
511,XXV,And shook its little fist.
512,XXV,
513,XXV,
514,XXVI,XXVI
515,XXVI,
516,XXVI,"But the Consul's brow was sad,"
517,XXVI,And the Consul's speech was low.             210
518,XXVI,"And darkly looked he at the wall,"
519,XXVI,And darkly at the foe.
520,XXVI,"""Their van will be upon us"

565,XXX,A Ramnian[41] proud was he:
566,XXX,"""Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,"
567,XXX,"And keep the bridge with thee."""

578,XXXI,And straight against that great array
579,XXXI,Forth went the dauntless Three.
580,XXXI,For Romans in Rome's quarrel
581,XXXI,"Spared neither land nor gold,"
582,XXXI,"Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life,           255"

584,XXXI,
585,XXXI,
586,XXXII,XXXII
587,XXXII,
588,XXXII,Then none was for a party;

590,XXXII,Then the great man helped the poor.
591,XXXII,"And the poor man loved the great,            260"
592,XXXII,"Then lands were fairly portioned,"
593,XXXII,Then spoils were fairly sold:[43]

596,XXXII,
597,XXXII,
598,XXXIII,XXXIII
599,XXXIII,
600,XXXIII,Now Roman is to Roman                          265

602,XXXIII,"And the Tribunes[44] beard[45] the high,"
603,XXXIII,And the Fathers grind the low.
604,XXXIII,"As we wax hot in faction,"
605,XXXIII,In battle we wax cold:                       270

612,XXXIV,Now while the Three were tightening
613,XXXIV,"Their harness[46] on their backs,"
614,XXXIV,The Consul was the foremost man                275
615,XXXIV,To take in hand an axe:
616,XXXIV,And Fathers mixed with Commons
617,XXXIV,"Seized hatchet, bar, and crow,"

629,XXXV,Four hundred trumpets sounded
630,XXXV,"A peal of warlike glee,"

642,XXXVI,From all the vanguard rose;                  295
643,XXXVI,And forth three chiefs came spurring
644,XXXVI,Before that deep array;
645,XXXVI,"To earth they sprang, their swords they drew,"
646,XXXVI,"And lifted high their shields, and flew"
647,XXXVI,To win the narrow way;                         300

660,XXXVII,The fortress of Nequinum[49] lowers
661,XXXVII,O'er the pale waves of Nar.                  310
662,XXXVII,
663,XXXVII,
664,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
665,XXXVIII,
666,XXXVIII,Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus
667,XXXVIII,Into the stream beneath:

670,XXXVIII,At Picus brave Horatius                        315
671,XXXVIII,Darted one fiery thrust;
672,XXXVIII,And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms
673,XXXVIII,Clashed in the bloody dust.
674,XXXVIII,
675,XXXVIII,
676,XXXIX,XXXIX
677,XXXIX,
678,XXXIX,Then Ocnus of Palerii[50]
679,XXXIX,Rushed on the Roman Three;                   320
680,XXXIX,"And Lausulus of Urgo,[51]"
681,XXXIX,The rover of the sea;[52]
682,XXXIX,"And Aruns of Volsinium,"

685,XXXIX,Amidst the reeds of Cosa's[53] fen
686,XXXIX,"And wasted fields, and slaughtered men,"

689,XXXIX,
690,XL,XL
691,XL,
692,XL,Herminius smote down Aruns:

694,XL,Right to the heart of Lausulus
695,XL,Horatius sent a blow.
696,XL,"""Lie there,"" he cried, ""fell pirate!"

706,XLI,
707,XLI,But now no sound of laughter                   340
708,XLI,Was heard among the foes.
709,XLI,A wild and wrathful clamor
710,XLI,From all the vanguard rose.
711,XLI,Six spears' lengths from the entrance
712,XLI,"Halted that deep array,                      345"
713,XLI,And for a space no man came forth
714,XLI,To win the narrow way.

716,XLI,
717,XLII,XLII
718,XLII,
719,XLII,But hark! the cry is Astur:
720,XLII,And lo! the ranks divide;
721,XLII,And the great Lord of Luna
722,XLII,Comes with his stately stride.               350
723,XLII,Upon his ample shoulders
724,XLII,"Clangs loud the fourfold shield,"
725,XLII,And in his hand he shakes the brand
726,XLII,Which none but he can wield.                 355
727,XLII,
728,XLII,
729,XLIII,XLIII
730,XLIII,
731,XLIII,He smiled on those bold Romans
732,XLIII,A smile serene and high;
733,XLIII,"He eyed the flinching Tuscans,"
734,XLIII,And scorn was in his eye.
735,XLIII,"Quoth he, ""The she-wolf's litter[57]           360"

743,XLIV,"Then, whirling up his broadsword"
744,XLIV,"With both hands to the height,               365"
745,XLIV,"He rushed against Horatius,"
746,XLIV,And smote with all his might.
747,XLIV,"With shield and blade Horatius,"
748,XLIV,Right deftly turned the blow.
749,XLIV,"The blow, though turned, came yet too nigh:    370"
750,XLIV,"It missed his helm, but gashed his thigh:"
751,XLIV,The Tuscans raised a joyful cry
752,XLIV,To see the red blood flow.

754,XLIV,
755,XLV,XLV
756,XLV,
757,XLV,"He reeled, and on Herminius"
758,XLV,He leaned one breathing-space;               375
759,XLV,"Then, like a wild-cat mad with wounds,"
760,XLV,Sprang right at Astur's face.
761,XLV,"Through teeth, and skull, and helmet"
762,XLV,So fierce a thrust he sped
763,XLV,The good sword stood a hand-breadth out        380
764,XLV,Behind the Tuscan's head.
765,XLV,
766,XLV,
767,XLVI,XLVI
768,XLVI,
769,XLVI,And the great Lord of Luna
770,XLVI,"Fell at that deadly stroke,"

773,XLVI,Far o'er the crashing forest
774,XLVI,The giant arms lie spread;
775,XLVI,"And the pale augurs, muttering low,"
776,XLVI,Gaze on the blasted head.

781,XLVII,On Astur's throat Horatius                     390
782,XLVII,Right firmly pressed his heel;
783,XLVII,"And thrice and four times tugged amain,"
784,XLVII,Ere be wrenched out the steel.

796,XLVI,Along that glittering van.
797,XLVI,"There lacked not men of prowess,"

2072,IX,"On the third morn thereafter,"

2080,IX,Hard by the Lake Regillus                              145

2161,XII,With restless pace and haggard face
2162,XII,To his last field he came.
2163,XII,Men said he saw strange visions

2165,XII,And that strange sounds were in his ears               215

2167,XII,"A woman[34] fair and stately,"
2168,XII,"But pale as are the dead,"

2189,XIII,"And Ferentinum of the rock,                            235"
2190,XIII,And Gabii of the pool.
2191,XIII,There rode the Volscian succours:
2192,XIII,"There, in a dark stern ring,"
2193,XIII,"The Roman exiles gathered close,"
2194,XIII,Around the ancient king.                             240
2195,XIII,"Though white as Mount Soracte,[36]"
2196,XIII,"When winter nights are long,"
2197,XIII,"His beard flowed down o'er mail and belt,"
2198,XIII,His heart and hand were strong:

2200,XIII,"Still flashed forth quenchless rage,"
2201,XIII,"And, if the lance shook in his gripe,"
2202,XIII,'Twas more with hate than age.
2203,XIII,Close at his side was Titus

2243,XV,Plated with steel and gold.

2245,XV,From the Digentian rock[40]
2246,XV,On a choice lamb that bounds alone
2247,XV,"Before Bandusia's[41] flock,                         280"

2252,XV,In his right hand the broadsword                       285
2253,XV,"That kept the bridge so well,"
2254,XV,And on his helm the crown[43] he won
2255,XV,When proud Fidenae fell.
2256,XV,Woe to the maid whose lover
2257,XV,Shall cross his path to-day!                         290
2258,XV,"False Sextus saw, and trembled,"
2259,XV,"And turned, and fled away."
2260,XV,"As turns, as flies, the woodman"
2261,XV,"In the Calabrian[44] brake,"
2262,XV,When through the reeds gleams the round eye            295
2263,XV,Of that fell speckled snake;
2264,XV,"So turned, so fled, false Sextus,"
2265,XV,"And hid him in the rear,"
2266,XV,"Behind the dark Lavinian ranks,"
2267,XV,Bristling with crest and spear.                      300

2270,XVI,XVI
2271,XVI,

2273,XVI,"The Master of the Knights,"
2274,XVI,Gave Tubero of Norba
2275,XVI,To feed the Porcian kites.
2276,XVI,Next under those red horse-hoofs                       305
2277,XVI,Flaccus of Setia lay;
2278,XVI,Better had he been pruning
2279,XVI,Among his elms[45] that day.
2280,XVI,"Mamilius saw the slaughter,"
2281,XVI,"And tossed his golden crest,                         310"
2282,XVI,And towards the Master of the Knights
2283,XVI,Through the thick battle pressed.
2284,XVI,Aebutias smote Mamilius
2285,XVI,"So fiercely, on the shield"
2286,XVI,That the great lord of Tusculum                        315
2287,XVI,Well nigh rolled on the field.
2288,XVI,"Mamilius smote Aebutius,"
2289,XVI,"With a good aim and true,"
2290,XVI,"Just where the neck and shoulder join,"
2291,XVI,And pierced him through and through;                 320
2292,XVI,And brave Aebutius Elva
2293,XVI,Fell swooning to the ground:
2294,XVI,But a thick wall of bucklers
2295,XVI,Encompassed him around.
2296,XVI,His clients[46] from the battle                        325
2297,XVI,"Bare him some little space,"
2298,XVI,"And filled a helm from the dark lake,"
2299,XVI,And bathed his brow and face;
2300,XVI,And when at last he opened
2301,XVI,"His swimming eyes to light,                          330"
2302,XVI,"Men say, the earliest word he spake"

2312,XVII,
2313,XVII,But meanwhile in the centre
2314,XVII,Great deeds of arms were wrought;
2315,XVII,There Aulus the Dictator                               335
2316,XVII,And there Valerius fought.
2317,XVII,Aulus with his good broadsword
2318,XVII,A bloody passage cleared
2319,XVII,"To where, amidst the thickest foes,"
2320,XVII,He saw the long white beard.                         340
2321,XVII,Flat lighted that good broadsword
2322,XVII,Upon proud Tarquin's head.
2323,XVII,He dropped the lance: he dropped the reins:
2324,XVII,He fell as fall the dead.
2325,XVII,"Down Aulus springs to slay him,                        345"
2326,XVII,With eyes like coals of fire;
2327,XVII,"But faster Titus[47] hath sprung down,"
2328,XVII,And hath bestrode his sire.
2329,XVII,"Latian captains, Roman knights,"
2330,XVII,"Fast down to earth they spring,                      350"
2331,XVII,And hand to hand they fight on foot
2332,XVII,Around the ancient king.
2333,XVII,First Titus gave tall Caeso
2334,XVII,A death wound in the face;
2335,XVII,Tall Caeso was the bravest man                         355
2336,XVII,Of the brave Fabian[48] race:
2337,XVII,"Aulus slew Rex of Gabii,"
2338,XVII,The priest of Juno's shrine:
2339,XVII,"Valerius smote down Julius,"
2340,XVII,Of Rome's great Julian line;[49]                     360
2341,XVII,"Julius, who left his mansion"
2342,XVII,"High on the Velian hill,[50]"
2343,XVII,And through all turns of weal and woe
2344,XVII,Followed proud Tarquin still.
2345,XVII,Now right across proud Tarquin                         365
2346,XVII,A corpse was Julius laid;
2347,XVII,"And Titus groaned with rage and grief,"
2348,XVII,And at Valerius made.
2349,XVII,"Valerius struck at Titus,"
2350,XVII,And lopped off half his crest;                       370
2351,XVII,But Titus stabbed Valerius
2352,XVII,A span deep in the breast.
2353,XVII,"Like a mast snapped by the tempest,"
2354,XVII,Valerius reeled and fell.
2355,XVII,Ah! woe is me for the good house                       375
2356,XVII,That loves the people well!
2357,XVII,Then shouted loud the Latines;
2358,XVII,And with one rush they bore
2359,XVII,The struggling Romans backward
2360,XVII,Three lances' length and more:                       380
2361,XVII,"And up they took proud Tarquin,"
2362,XVII,"And laid him on a shield,"
2363,XVII,"And four strong yeoman bare him,"
2364,XVII,Still senseless from the field.
2365,XVII,
2366,XVII,
2367,XVIII,XVIII
2368,XVIII,
2369,XVIII,But fiercer grew the fighting                          385
2370,XVIII,Around Valerius dead;
2371,XVIII,"For Titus dragged him by the foot,"
2372,XVIII,And Aulus by the head.
2373,XVIII,"""On, Latines, on!"" quoth Titus,"
2374,XVIII,"""See how the rebels fly!""                            390"
2375,XVIII,"""Romans, stand firm!"" quoth Aulus,"
2376,XVIII,"""And win this fight or die!"
2377,XVIII,They must not give Valerius
2378,XVIII,To raven and to kite;
2379,XVIII,"For aye Valerius loathed the wrong,                    395"
2380,XVIII,And aye upheld the right:
2381,XVIII,And for your wives and babies
2382,XVIII,In the front rank he fell.
2383,XVIII,Now play the men for the good house
2384,XVIII,"That loves the people well!""                         400"
2385,XVIII,
2386,XVIII,
2387,XIX,XIX
2388,XIX,
2389,XIX,Then tenfold round the body
2390,XIX,"The roar of battle rose,"
2391,XIX,"Like the roar of a burning forest,"
2392,XIX,"""When a strong north wind blows."
2393,XIX,"Now backward, and now forward,                         405"
2394,XIX,"Rocked furiously the fray,"
2395,XIX,"Till none could see Valerius,"
2396,XIX,And none wist where he lay.
2397,XIX,For shivered arms and ensigns

3866,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Be not however in haste; I can wait, I shall not be impatient!"""
3867,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Straightway Alden replied, as he folded the last of his letters,"
3868,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Pushing his papers aside, and giving respectful attention:"
3869,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"""Speak: for whenever you speak, I am always ready to listen.         130"
3870,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Always ready to hear whatever pertains to Miles Standish."""
3871,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Thereupon answered the Captain, embarrassed, and culling his phrases;"
3872,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"""'T is not good for a man to be alone, say the Scriptures.[20]"
3873,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"This I have said before, and again and again I repeat it;"
3874,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Every hour in the day, I think it, and feel it, and say it.          135"
3875,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Since Rose Standish died, my life has been weary and dreary,"
3876,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Sick at heart have I been, beyond the healing of friendship."
3877,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,Oft in my lonely hours have I thought of the maiden Priscilla.
3878,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,She is alone in the world; her father and mother and brother
3879,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Died in the winter together; I saw her going and coming,             140"
3880,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Now to the grave of the dead, and now to the bed of the dying."
3881,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Patient, courageous, and strong, and said to myself, that if ever"
3882,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"There were angels on earth, as there are angels in heaven,"
3883,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Two have I seen and known, and the angel whose name is Priscilla"
3884,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,Holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned.       145
3885,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Long have I cherished the thought, but never have dared to reveal it,"
3886,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Being a coward in this, though valiant enough for the most part."
3887,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Go to the damsel Priscilla, the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,"
3888,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Say that a blunt old Captain, a man not of words but of actions,"
3889,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Offers his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier.      150"
3890,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Not in these words, you know, but this in short is my meaning;"
3891,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"I am a maker of war, and not a maker of phrases,"
3892,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"You, who are bred as a scholar, can say it in elegant language,"
3893,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers,"
3894,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden.""        155"
3895,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,
3896,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"""When he had spoken, John Alden, the fair-haired, taciturn stripling,"
3897,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"All aghast at his words, surprised, embarrassed, bewildered,"
3898,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Trying to mask his dismay by treating the subject with lightness,"
3899,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Trying to smile, and yet feeling his heart stand still in his bosom."
3900,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,
3901,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,Just as a timepiece stops in a house that is stricken by lightning.  160
3902,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Thus made answer and spake, or rather stammered than answered:"
3903,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"""Such a message as that, I am sure I should mangle and mar it;"
3904,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"If you would have it well done,--I am only repeating your maxim,--"
3905,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"You must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!"""
3906,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,But with the air of a man whom nothing can turn from his purpose     165
3907,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Gravely shaking his head, made answer the Captain of Plymouth:"
3908,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"""Truly the maxim is good, and I do not mean to gainsay it;"
3909,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"But we must use it discreetly, and not waste powder for nothing."
3910,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Now, as I said before, I was never a maker of phrases."
3911,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"I can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender,      170"
3912,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"But march up to a woman with such a proposal, I dare not."
3913,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"I'm not afraid of bullets, nor shot from the mouth of a cannon,"
3914,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"But of a thundering 'No!' point-blank from the mouth of a woman,"
3915,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"That I confess I'm afraid of, nor am I ashamed to confess it!"
3916,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"So you must grant my request, for you are an elegant scholar,        175"
3917,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Having the graces of speech, and skill in the turning of phrases,"""
3918,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Taking the hand of his friend; who still was reluctant and doubtful,"
3919,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Holding it long in his own, and pressing it kindly, he added:"
3920,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"""Though I have spoken thus lightly, yet deep is the feeling"
3921,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,that prompts me;
3922,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Surely you cannot refuse what I ask in the name of our friendship!""  180"
3923,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Then made answer John Alden:  ""The name of friendship is sacred;"
3924,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"What you demand in that name, I have not the power to deny you!"""
3925,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"So the strong will prevailed, subduing and moulding the gentler,"
3926,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.,"Friendship prevailed over love, and Alden went on his errand."

3932,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.
3933,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,
3934,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"So the strong will prevailed, and Alden went on his errand,          185"
3935,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Out of the street of the village, and into the paths of the forest,"
3936,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Into the tranquil woods, where bluebirds and robins were building"
3937,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Towns in the populous trees, with hanging gardens of verdure,"
3938,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Peaceful, aerial cities of joy and affection, and freedom!"
3939,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"All around him was calm, but within him commotion and conflict,      190"
3940,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Love contending with friendship, and self with each generous impulse."
3941,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"To and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing,"
3942,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"As in a foundering ship, with every roll of the vessel,"
3943,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Washes the bitter sea, the merciless surge of the ocean!"
3944,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"""Must I relinquish it all,"" he cried with a wild lamentation,--      195"
3945,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"""Must I relinquish it all, the joy, the hope, the illusion?[21]"
3946,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Was it for this I have loved, and waited, and worshipped in silence!"
3947,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Was it for this I have followed the flying feet and the shadow
3948,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Over the wintry sea, to the desolate shores of New England?"
3949,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Truly the heart is deceitful, and out of its depths of corruption    200"
3950,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Rise, like an exhalation, the misty phantoms of passion;"
3951,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Angels of light they seem, but are only delusions of Satan."
3952,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"All is clear to me now; I feel it, I see it distinctly!"
3953,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"This is the hand of the Lord; it is laid upon me in anger,"
3954,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"For I have followed too much the heart's desires and devices,        205"
3955,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Worshipping Astaroth blindly, and impious idols of Baal.[22]"
3956,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"This is the cross I must bear; the sin and the swift retribution."""
3957,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,
3958,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went, on his errand;"
3959,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Crossing the brook at the ford, where it brawled over pebble"
3960,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"and shallow,"
3961,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Gathering still, as he went, the Mayflowers[23] blooming"
3962,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"around him,                                                      210"
3963,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Fragrant, filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness,"
3964,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Children lost in the woods, and covered with leaves in their slumber."
3965,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"""Puritan flowers,"" he said, ""and the type of Puritan maidens,"
3966,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Modest and simple and sweet, the very type of Priscilla!"
3967,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"So I will take them to her; to Priscilla the Mayflower of Plymouth,  215"
3968,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Modest and simple and sweet, as a parting gift will I take them;"
3969,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Breathing their silent farewells, as they fade and wither and perish,"
3970,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Soon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver."""
3971,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;
3972,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Came to an open space, and saw the disk of the ocean,                220"
3973,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Sailless, sombre and cold with the comfortless breath of the east-wind;"
3974,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Saw the new-built house, and people at work in a meadow;"
3975,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Heard, as he drew near the door, the musical voice of Priscilla"
3976,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Singing the hundredth Psalm, the grand old Puritan anthem,"
3977,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Music that Luther sang to the sacred words of the Psalmist,          225"
3978,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Full of the breath of the Lord, consoling and comforting many."
3979,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Then, as he opened the door, he beheld the form of the maiden,"
3980,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Seated beside her wheel, and the carded wool like a snow-drift"
3981,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Piled at her knee, her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle,"
3982,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,While with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel
3983,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,in its motion.                                                   230
3984,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Open wide on her lap lay the well-worn psalm-book of Ainsworth,[34]"
3985,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Printed in Amsterdam, the words and the music together,"
3986,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Rough-hewn, angular notes, like stones in the wall of a churchyard,"
3987,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses.
3988,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Such was the book from whose pages she sang the old Puritan anthem,  235"
3989,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"She, the Puritan girl, in the solitude of the forest,"
3990,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Making the humble house and the modest apparel of homespun
3991,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Beautiful with her beauty, and rich with the wealth of her being!"
3992,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Over him rushed, like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless,"
3993,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Thoughts of what might have been, and the weight and woe"
3994,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,of his errand;                                                   240
3995,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"All the dreams that had faded, and all the hopes that had vanished,"
3996,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"All his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion,"
3997,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Haunted by vain regrets, and pallid, sorrowful faces."
3998,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Still he said to himself, and almost fiercely he said it,"
3999,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"""Let not him that putteth his hand to the plough look backwards;[35] 245"
4000,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Though the ploughshare cut through the flowers of life to
4001,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"its fountains,"
4002,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Though it pass o'er the graves of the dead and the hearths
4003,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"of the living,"
4004,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"It is the will of the Lord, and his mercy endureth forever!"""
4005,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,
4006,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,So he entered the house; and the hum of the wheel and the singing
4007,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Suddenly ceased; for Priscilla, aroused by his step"
4008,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"on the threshold,                                                250"
4009,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Rose as he entered and gave him her hand, in signal of welcome,"
4010,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Saying, ""I knew it was you, when I heard your step in the passage;"
4011,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"For I was thinking of you, as I sat there singing and spinning."""
4012,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Awkward and dumb with delight, that a thought of him had been mingled"
4013,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Thus in the sacred psalm, that came from the heart of the maiden,    255"
4014,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Silent before her he stood, and gave her the flowers for an answer,"
4015,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Finding no words for his thought.  He remembered that day
4016,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"in the winter,"
4017,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"After the first great snow, when he broke a path from the village,"
4018,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,
4019,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered
4020,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"the doorway,"
4021,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house,"
4022,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,and Priscilla                                                    260
4023,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Laughed at his snowy locks, and gave him a seat by the fireside,"
4024,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snow-storm.
4025,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Had he but spoken then! perhaps not in vain had he spoken;
4026,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Now it was all too late; the golden moment had vanished!
4027,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"So he stood there abashed, and gave her the flowers for an answer.   265"
4028,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,
4029,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Then they sat down and talked of the birds and the beautiful
4030,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Spring-time;
4031,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Talked of their friends at home, and the Mayflower that sailed"
4032,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,on the morrow.
4033,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"""I have been thinking all day,"" said gently the Puritan maiden,"
4034,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"""Dreaming all night, and thinking all day, of the hedge-rows"
4035,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"of England,--"
4036,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"They are in blossom now, and the country is all like a garden;       270"
4037,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Thinking of lanes and fields, and the song of the lark and the linnet,"
4038,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Seeing the village street, and familiar faces of neighbors"
4039,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Going about as of old, and stopping to gossip together,"
4040,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"And, at the end of the street, the village church, with the ivy"
4041,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Climbing the old gray tower, and the quiet graves in the churchyard. 275"
4042,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Kind are the people I live with, and dear to me my religion;"
4043,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Still my heart is so sad, that I wish myself back in Old England."
4044,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"You will say it is wrong, but I cannot help it: I almost"
4045,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Wish myself back in Old England, I feel so lonely and wretched."""
4046,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,
4047,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Thereupon answered the youth: ""Indeed I do not condemn you;          280"
4048,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Stouter hearts than a woman's have quailed in this terrible winter.
4049,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Yours is tender and trusting, and needs a stronger to lean on;"
4050,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"So I have come to you now, with an offer and proffer of marriage"
4051,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Made by a good man and true, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth!"""
4052,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,
4053,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Thus he delivered his message, the dexterous writer of letters,--    285"
4054,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Did not embellish the theme, nor array it in beautiful phrases,"
4055,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"But came straight to the point, and blurted it out like a school-boy;"
4056,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Even the Captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly.
4057,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Mute with amazement and sorrow, Priscilla the Puritan maiden"
4058,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Looked into Alden's face, her eyes dilated with wonder,              290"
4059,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Feeling his words like a blow, that stunned her and rendered"
4060,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,her speechless;
4061,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Till at length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence:"
4062,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"""If the great Captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me,"
4063,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Why does he not come himself, and take the trouble to woo me?"
4064,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"If I am not worth the wooing, I surely am not worth the winning!""    295"
4065,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Then John Alden began explaining and smoothing the matter,"
4066,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Making it worse as he went, by saying the Captain was busy,--"
4067,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Had no time for such things;--such things! the words grated harshly
4068,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Fell on the ear of Priscilla; and swift as a flash she made answer:
4069,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"""Has he no time for such things, as you call it, before he"
4070,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"is married,                                                      300"
4071,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Would he be likely to find it, or make it, after the wedding?"
4072,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"That is the way with you men; you don't understand us, you cannot."
4073,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"When you have made up your minds, after thinking of this one"
4074,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"and that one,"
4075,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Choosing, selecting, rejecting, comparing one with another,"
4076,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Then you make known your desire, with abrupt and sudden avowal,      305"
4077,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"And are offended and hurt, and indignant, perhaps, that a woman"
4078,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Does not respond at once to a love that she never suspected,"
4079,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Does not attain at a bound the height to which you have been climbing.
4080,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"This is not right nor just, for surely a woman's affection"
4081,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Is not a thing to be asked for, and had for only the asking.         310"
4082,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"When one is truly in love, one not only says it, but shows it"
4083,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Had he but waited awhile, had he only showed that he loved me,"
4084,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Even this Captain of yours--who knows?--at last might have won me,"
4085,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Old and rough as he is, but now it never can happen."""
4086,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,
4087,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Still John Alden went on, unheeding the words of Priscilla,          315"
4088,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Urging the suit of his friend, explaining, persuading, expanding;"
4089,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Spoke of his courage and skill, and of all his battles in Flanders,"
4090,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"How with the people of God he had chosen to suffer affliction,"
4091,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"How, in return for his zeal, they had made him Captain of Plymouth;"
4092,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"He was a gentleman born, could trace his pedigree plainly            320"
4093,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Back to Hugh Standish of Duxbury Hall, in Lancashire, England,"
4094,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Who was the son of Ralph; and the grandson of Thurston de Standish;
4095,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Heir unto vast estates, of which he was basely defrauded,"
4096,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Still bore the family arms, and had for his crest a cock argent"
4097,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Combed and wattled gules,[26] and all the rest of the blazon.        325"
4098,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"He was a man of honor, of noble and generous nature;"
4099,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Though he was rough, he was kindly; she knew how during the winter"
4100,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"He had attended the sick, with a hand as gentle as woman's;"
4101,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Somewhat hasty and hot, he could not deny it, and headstrong,"
4102,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Stern as a soldier might be, but hearty, and placable always,        330"
4103,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Not to be laughed at and scorned, because he was little of stature;"
4104,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"For he was great of heart, magnanimous, courtly, courageous;"
4105,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Any woman in Plymouth, nay, any woman in England,"
4106,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,Might be happy and proud to be called the wife of Miles Standish!
4107,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,
4108,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"But as he warmed and glowed, in his simple and eloquent language,    335"
4109,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Quite forgetful of self, and full of the praise of his rival,"
4110,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Archly the maiden smiled, and, with eyes overrunning with laughter,"
4111,THE LOVER'S ERRAND.,"Said, in a tremulous voice, ""Why don't you speak for yourself, John?"""

4132,JOHN ALDEN.,"of sea-grass,                                                    350"
4133,JOHN ALDEN.,"Blowing o'er rocky wastes, and the grottos and gardens of ocean!"
4134,JOHN ALDEN.,"Lay thy cold, moist hand on my burning forehead, and wrap me"
4135,JOHN ALDEN.,"Close in thy garments of mist, to allay the fever within me!"""
4136,JOHN ALDEN.,
4137,JOHN ALDEN.,"Like an awakened conscience, the sea was moaning and tossing,"
4138,JOHN ALDEN.,"Beating remorseful and loud the mutable sands of the sea-shore,      355"
4139,JOHN ALDEN.,Fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending;
4140,JOHN ALDEN.,"Love triumphant and crowned, and friendship wounded and bleeding,"
4141,JOHN ALDEN.,"Passionate cries of desire, and importunate pleadings of duty!"
4142,JOHN ALDEN.,"""Is it my fault,"" he said, ""that the maiden has chosen between us?"
4143,JOHN ALDEN.,"Is it my fault that he failed,--my fault that I am the victor?       360"
4144,JOHN ALDEN.,"Then within him there thundered a voice, like the voice of the Prophet:"
4145,JOHN ALDEN.,"""It hath displeased the Lord!""--and he thought of David's"
4146,JOHN ALDEN.,"transgression,[29]"
4147,JOHN ALDEN.,"Bathsheba's beautiful face, and his friend in the front of the battle!"
4148,JOHN ALDEN.,"Shame and confusion of guilt, and abasement and self-condemnation,"
4149,JOHN ALDEN.,Overwhelmed him at once; and he cried in the deepest contrition:     365
4150,JOHN ALDEN.,"""It hath displeased the Lord!  It is the temptation of Satan!"""
4151,JOHN ALDEN.,
4152,JOHN ALDEN.,"Then, uplifting his head, he looked at the sea, and beheld there"
4153,JOHN ALDEN.,"Dimly the shadowy form of the Mayflower riding at anchor,"
4154,JOHN ALDEN.,"Rocked on the rising tide, and ready to sail on the morrow;"
4155,JOHN ALDEN.,"Heard the voices of men through the mist, the rattle of cordage      370"
4156,JOHN ALDEN.,"Thrown on the deck, the shouts of the mate, and the sailors'"
4157,JOHN ALDEN.,"""Ay, ay, Sir!"""
4158,JOHN ALDEN.,"Clear and distinct, but not loud, in the dripping air of the twilight."
4159,JOHN ALDEN.,"Still for a moment he stood, and listened, and stared at the vessel,"
4160,JOHN ALDEN.,"Then went hurriedly on, as one who, seeing a phantom,"
4161,JOHN ALDEN.,"Stops, then quickens his pace, and follows the beckoning, shadow.    375"
4162,JOHN ALDEN.,"""Yes, it is plain, to me now,"" he murmured; ""the hand of the Lord is"
4163,JOHN ALDEN.,"Leading me out of the land of darkness, the bondage of error,"
4164,JOHN ALDEN.,"Through the sea, that shall lift the walls of its waters around me,"
4165,JOHN ALDEN.,"Hiding me, cutting me off, from the cruel thoughts that pursue me."
4166,JOHN ALDEN.,"Back will I go o'er the ocean, this dreary land will abandon,        380"
4167,JOHN ALDEN.,"Her whom I may not love, and him whom my heart has offended."
4168,JOHN ALDEN.,"Better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in England,"
4169,JOHN ALDEN.,"Close by my mother's side, and among the dust of my kindred;"
4170,JOHN ALDEN.,"Better be dead and forgotten, than living in shame and dishonor!"
4171,JOHN ALDEN.,"Sacred and safe and unseen, in the dark of the narrow chamber        385"
4172,JOHN ALDEN.,"With me my secret shall lie, like a buried jewel that glimmers"
4173,JOHN ALDEN.,"Bright on the hand that is dust, in the chambers of silence"
4174,JOHN ALDEN.,"and darkness,--"
4175,JOHN ALDEN.,"Yes, as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter!"""
4176,JOHN ALDEN.,
4177,JOHN ALDEN.,"Thus as he spake, he turned, in the strength of his strong resolution,"
4178,JOHN ALDEN.,"Leaving behind him the shore, and hurried along in the twilight,     390"
4179,JOHN ALDEN.,"Through the congenial gloom of the forest silent and sombre,"
4180,JOHN ALDEN.,"Till he beheld the lights in the seven houses of Plymouth,"
4181,JOHN ALDEN.,Shining like seven stars in the dusk and mist of the evening.
4182,JOHN ALDEN.,"Soon he entered his door, and found the redoubtable Captain"
4183,JOHN ALDEN.,"Sitting alone, and absorbed in the martial pages of Caesar,          395"
4184,JOHN ALDEN.,Fighting some great campaign in Hainault or Brabant or Flanders.[30]
4185,JOHN ALDEN.,"""Long have you been on your errand,"" he said with a cheery demeanor,"
4186,JOHN ALDEN.,"Even as one who is waiting an answer, and fears not the issue."
4187,JOHN ALDEN.,"""Not far off is the house, although the woods are between us;"
4188,JOHN ALDEN.,"But you have lingered so long, that while you were going"
4189,JOHN ALDEN.,and coming                                                           400
4190,JOHN ALDEN.,I have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city.
4191,JOHN ALDEN.,"Come, sit down, and in order relate to me all that has happened."""
4192,JOHN ALDEN.,
4193,JOHN ALDEN.,"Then John Alden spake, and related the wondrous adventure"
4194,JOHN ALDEN.,"From beginning to end, minutely, just as it happened;"
4195,JOHN ALDEN.,"How he had seen Priscilla, and how he had sped in his courtship,     405"
4196,JOHN ALDEN.,"Only smoothing a little, and softening down her refusal."
4197,JOHN ALDEN.,"But when he came at length to the words Priscilla had spoken,"
4198,JOHN ALDEN.,"Words so tender and cruel, ""Why don't you speak for yourself, John?"""
4199,JOHN ALDEN.,"Up leaped the Captain of Plymouth, and stamped on the floor,"
4200,JOHN ALDEN.,till his armor
4201,JOHN ALDEN.,"Clanged on the wall, where it hung, with a sound of sinister omen.   410"
4202,JOHN ALDEN.,"All his pent-up wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion,"
4203,JOHN ALDEN.,"E'en as a hand-grenade,[31] that scatters destruction around it."
4204,JOHN ALDEN.,"Wildly he shouted, and loud: ""John Alden! you have betrayed me!"
4205,JOHN ALDEN.,"Me, Miles Standish, your friend! have supplanted, defrauded,"
4206,JOHN ALDEN.,betrayed me!
4207,JOHN ALDEN.,One of my ancestors ran his sword through the heart of
4208,JOHN ALDEN.,Wat Tyler;[32]                                                   415
4209,JOHN ALDEN.,Who shall prevent me from running my own through the heart
4210,JOHN ALDEN.,of a traitor?
4211,JOHN ALDEN.,"Yours is the greater treason, for yours is a treason to friendship!"
4212,JOHN ALDEN.,"You, who lived under my roof, whom I cherished and loved as a brother;"
4213,JOHN ALDEN.,"You, who have fed at my board, and drunk at my cup, to whose keeping"
4214,JOHN ALDEN.,"I have intrusted my honor, my thoughts the most sacred"
4215,JOHN ALDEN.,"and secret,--                                                    420"
4216,JOHN ALDEN.,"You, too, Brutus! ah, woe to the name of friendship hereafter!"
4217,JOHN ALDEN.,"Brutus was Caesar's friend, and you were mine, but hence-forward"
4218,JOHN ALDEN.,"Let there be nothing between us save war, and implacable hatred!"""
4219,JOHN ALDEN.,
4220,JOHN ALDEN.,"So spake the Captain of Plymouth, and strode about in the chamber,"
4221,JOHN ALDEN.,"Chafing and choking with rage, like cords were the veins"
4222,JOHN ALDEN.,on his temples.                                                  425
4223,JOHN ALDEN.,"But in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway,"
4224,JOHN ALDEN.,"Bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance,"
4225,JOHN ALDEN.,Rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of Indians!
4226,JOHN ALDEN.,"Straightway the Captain paused, and, without further question"
4227,JOHN ALDEN.,"or parley,"
4228,JOHN ALDEN.,"Took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron,  430"
4229,JOHN ALDEN.,"Buckled the belt round his waist, and, frowning fiercely, departed."
4230,JOHN ALDEN.,Alden was left alone.  He heard the clank of the scabbard
4231,JOHN ALDEN.,"Growing fainter and fainter, and dying away in the distance."
4232,JOHN ALDEN.,"Then he arose from his seat, and looked forth into the darkness,"
4233,JOHN ALDEN.,"Felt the cool air blow on his cheek, that was hot with the insult,   435"
4234,JOHN ALDEN.,"Lifted his eyes to the heavens, and, folding his hands as in childhood,"
4235,JOHN ALDEN.,Prayed in the silence of night to the Father who seeth in secret.
4236,JOHN ALDEN.,"Meanwhile the choleric Captain strode wrathful away to the council,"
4237,JOHN ALDEN.,"Found it already assembled, impatiently waiting his coming;"
4238,JOHN ALDEN.,"Men in the middle of life, austere and grave in deportment,          440"
4239,JOHN ALDEN.,"Only one of them old, the hill that was nearest to heaven,"
4240,JOHN ALDEN.,"Covered with snow, but erect, the excellent Elder of Plymouth.[33]"
4241,JOHN ALDEN.,"God had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planning,"
4242,JOHN ALDEN.,"Then had sifted the wheat, as the living seed of a nation;"
4243,JOHN ALDEN.,"So say the chronicles' old, and such is the faith of the people!     445"
4244,JOHN ALDEN.,"Near them was standing an Indian, in attitude stern and defiant,"
4245,JOHN ALDEN.,"Naked down to the waist, and grim and ferocious in aspect;"
4246,JOHN ALDEN.,"While on the table before them was lying unopened a Bible,"
4247,JOHN ALDEN.,"Ponderous, bound in leather, brass-studded, printed in Holland,"
4248,JOHN ALDEN.,"And beside it outstretched the skin of a rattlesnake glittered,      450"
4249,JOHN ALDEN.,"Filled, like a quiver, with arrows: a signal and challenge of warfare,"
4250,JOHN ALDEN.,"Brought by the Indian, and speaking with arrowy tongues of defiance."
4251,JOHN ALDEN.,"This Miles Standish beheld, as he entered, and heard them debating"
4252,JOHN ALDEN.,"What were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace,"
4253,JOHN ALDEN.,"Talking of tins and of that, contriving, suggesting, objecting;      455"
4254,JOHN ALDEN.,"One voice only for peace, and that the voice of the Elder,"
4255,JOHN ALDEN.,"Judging it wise and well that some at least were converted,"
4256,JOHN ALDEN.,"Rather than any were slain, for this was but Christian behavior!"
4257,JOHN ALDEN.,"Then out spake Miles Standish, the stalwart Captain of Plymouth,"
4258,JOHN ALDEN.,"Muttering deep in his throat, for his voice was husky with anger,    460"
4259,JOHN ALDEN.,"""What! do you mean to make war with milk and the water of roses?"
4260,JOHN ALDEN.,Is it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted
4261,JOHN ALDEN.,"There on the roof of the church, or is it to shoot red devils?"
4262,JOHN ALDEN.,Truly the only tongue that is understood by a savage
4263,JOHN ALDEN.,Must be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of
4264,JOHN ALDEN.,"the cannon!""                                                     465"
4265,JOHN ALDEN.,"Thereupon answered and said the excellent Elder of Plymouth,"
4266,JOHN ALDEN.,Somewhat amazed and alarmed at this irreverent language:
4267,JOHN ALDEN.,"""Not so thought Saint Paul, nor yet the other Apostles;"
4268,JOHN ALDEN.,Not from the cannon's mouth were the tongues of fire they
4269,JOHN ALDEN.,"spake with!""[34]"
4270,JOHN ALDEN.,"But unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the Captain,                   470"
4271,JOHN ALDEN.,"Who had advanced to the table, and thus continued discoursing:"
4272,JOHN ALDEN.,"""Leave this matter to me, for to me by right it pertaineth."
4273,JOHN ALDEN.,"War is a terrible trade; but in the cause that is righteous,"
4274,JOHN ALDEN.,"Sweet is the smell of powder, and thus I answer the challenge!"""
4275,JOHN ALDEN.,
4276,JOHN ALDEN.,"Then from the rattlesnake's skin, with a sudden, contemptuous"
4277,JOHN ALDEN.,"gesture,                                                         475"
4278,JOHN ALDEN.,"Jerking the Indian arrows, he filled it with powder and bullets"
4279,JOHN ALDEN.,"Full to the very jaws, and handed it back to the savage,"
4280,JOHN ALDEN.,"Saying, in thundering tones; ""Here, take it! this is your answer!"""
4281,JOHN ALDEN.,"Silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage,"
4282,JOHN ALDEN.,"Bearing the serpent's skin, and seeming himself like a serpent,      480"
4283,JOHN ALDEN.,Winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest.

4290,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,
4291,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Just in the gray of the dawn, as the mists uprose from the meadows,"
4292,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,There was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of Plymouth;
4293,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Clanging and clicking of arms, and the order imperative, ""Forward!"""
4294,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Given in tone suppressed, a tramp of feet, and then silence.         485"
4295,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Figures ten, in the mist, marched slowly out of the village."
4296,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Standish the stalwart it was, with eight of his valorous army,"
4297,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Led by their Indian guide, by Hobomok, friend of the white men,"
4298,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,Northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage.
4299,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Giants they seemed in the mist, or the mighty men of King David;     490"
4300,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Giants in heart they were, who believed in God and the Bible,--"
4301,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Ay, who believed in the smiting of Midianites and Philistines,"
4302,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,Over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning;
4303,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Under them loud on the sands, the serried billows, advancing,"
4304,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Fired along the line, and in regular order retreated.                495"
4305,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,
4306,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Many a mile had they marched, when at length the village of Plymouth"
4307,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Woke from its sleep, and arose, intent on its manifold labors."
4308,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,Sweet was the air and soft; and slowly the smoke from the chimneys
4309,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Rose over roofs of thatch, and pointed steadily eastward;"
4310,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Men came forth from the doors, and paused and talked of the weather, 500"
4311,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Said that the wind had changed, and was blowing fair for the Mayflower;"
4312,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Talked of their Captain's departure, and all the dangers that menaced,"
4313,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"He being gone, the town, and what should be done in his absence."
4314,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Merrily sang the birds, and the tender voices of women"
4315,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,Consecrated with hymns the common cares of the household.            505
4316,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Out of the sea rose the sun, and the billows rejoiced at his coming;"
4317,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Beautiful were his feet on the purple tops of the mountains,"
4318,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Beautiful on the sails of the Mayflower riding at anchor,"
4319,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,Battered and blackened and worn by all the storms of the winter.
4320,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Loosely against her masts was hanging and flapping her canvas,       510"
4321,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Rent by so many gales, and patched by the hands of the sailors."
4322,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Suddenly from her side, as the sun rose over the ocean,"
4323,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Darted a puff of smoke, and floated seaward; anon rang"
4324,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Loud over field and forest the cannon's roar, and the echoes"
4325,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Heard and repeated the sound, the signal-gun of departure!           515"
4326,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,Ah! but with louder echoes replied the hearts of the people!
4327,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Meekly, in voices subdued, the chapter was read from the Bible,"
4328,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Meekly the prayer was begun, but ended in fervent entreaty!"
4329,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Then from their houses in haste came forth the Pilgrims of Plymouth,"
4330,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Men and women and children, all hurrying down to the seashore,       520"
4331,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Eager, with tearful eyes, to say farewell to the Mayflower,"
4332,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Homeward bound o'er the sea, and leaving them here in the"

4334,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,
4335,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Foremost among them was Alden.  All night he had lain without slumber,"
4336,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,Turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever.
4337,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"He had beheld Miles Standish, who came back late from the council,   535"
4338,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Stalking into the room, and heard him mutter and murmur,"
4339,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Sometimes it seemed a prayer, and sometimes it sounded like swearing."
4340,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Once he had come to the bed, and stood there a moment in silence;"
4341,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Then he had turned away, and said: ""I will not awake him;"
4342,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Let him sleep on, it is best; for what is the use of more talking!""  530"
4343,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Then he extinguished the light, and threw himself down on his pallet,"
4344,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Dressed as he was, and ready to start at the break of the morning,--"
4345,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,Covered himself with the cloak he had worn in his campaigns
4346,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"in Flanders,--"
4347,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Slept as a soldier sleeps in his bivouac, ready for action."
4348,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,But with the dawn he arose; in the twilight Alden beheld him         535
4349,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Put on his corselet of steel, and all the rest of his armor,"
4350,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Buckle about his waist his trusty blade of Damascus,"
4351,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Take from the corner his musket, and so stride out of the chamber."
4352,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Often the heart of the youth had burned and yearned to embrace him,"
4353,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Often his lips had essayed to speak, imploring for pardon;           540"
4354,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,All the old friendship came back with its tender and grateful emotions;
4355,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"But his pride overmastered the nobler nature within him,--"
4356,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Pride, and the sense of his wrong, and the burning fire of the insult."
4357,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"So he beheld his friend departing in anger, but spake not,"
4358,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Saw him go forth to danger, perhaps to death, and he spake not!      545"
4359,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Then he arose from his bed, and heard what the people were saying,"
4360,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Joined in the talk at the door, with Stephen and Richard and"
4361,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Gilbert,[35]"
4362,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Joined in the morning prayer, and in the reading of Scripture,"
4363,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"And, with the others, in haste went hurrying down to the sea-shore,"
4364,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Down to the Plymouth Rock, that had been to their feet as"
4365,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,a doorstep                                                       550
4366,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Into a world unknown,--the corner-stone of a nation!"
4367,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,
4368,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"There with his boat was the Master, already a little impatient"
4369,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Lest he should lose the tide, or the wind might shift to the eastward,"
4370,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Square-built, hearty, and strong, with an odor of ocean about him,"
4371,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Speaking with this one and that, and cramming letters and parcels    555"
4372,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Into his pockets capacious, and messages mingled together"
4373,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Into his narrow brain, till at last he was wholly bewildered."
4374,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Nearer the boat stood Alden, with one foot placed on the gunwale,[36]"
4375,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"One still firm on the rock, and talking at times with the sailors,"
4376,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Seated erect on the thwarts,[37] all ready and eager for starting,   560"
4377,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"He too was eager to go, and thus put an end to his anguish,"
4378,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Thinking to fly from despair, that swifter than keel is or canvas,"
4379,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,Thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him.
4380,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"But as he gazed on the crowd, he beheld the form of Priscilla"
4381,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Standing dejected among them, unconscious of all that was passing.   565"
4382,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Fixed were her eyes upon his, as if she divined his intention,"
4383,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Fixed with a look so sad, so reproachful, imploring, and patient,"
4384,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"That with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose,"
4385,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"As from the verge of a crag, where one step more is destruction."
4386,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Strange is the heart of man, with its quick, mysterious instincts!   570"
4387,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Strange is the life of man, and fatal or fated are moments,"
4388,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Whereupon turn, as on hinges, the gates of the wall adamantine[38]"
4389,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"""Here I remain!"" he exclaimed, as he looked at the heavens above him,"
4390,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Thanking the Lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the madness,"
4391,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Wherein, blind and lost, to death he was staggering headlong.        575"
4392,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"""Yonder snow-white cloud, that floats in the ether above me,"
4393,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Seems like a hand that is pointing, and beckoning over the ocean."
4394,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"There is another hand, that is not so spectral and ghost-like,"
4395,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Holding me, drawing me back, and clasping mine for protection."
4396,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Float, O hand of cloud, and vanish away in the ether!                580"
4397,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Roll thyself up like a fist, to threaten, and daunt me; I heed not"

4406,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,
4407,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Meanwhile the Master alert, but with dignified air and important,"
4408,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Scanning with watchful eye the tide and the wind and the weather,    590"
4409,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Walked about on the sands, and the people crowded around him"

4411,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Then, taking each by the hand, as if he were grasping a tiller,"

4421,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Heaving the windlass round, and hoisting the ponderous anchor."
4422,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Then the yards[39] were braced, and all sails set to the west-wind,"
4423,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Blowing steady and strong, and the Mayflower sailed from the harbor,"

4430,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Long in silence they watched, the receding sail of the vessel,"
4431,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Much endeared to them all, as something living and human;            610"

4433,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Baring his hoary head, the excellent Elder of Plymouth."
4434,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Said, ""Let us pray!"" and they prayed, and thanked the Lord and"

4436,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock, and above them"

4445,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Watching them from the hill; but while they spake with each other,"
4446,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"Pointing with outstretched hands, and saying, ""Look!"" he had vanished."
4447,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"So they returned to their homes; but Alden lingered a little,"

4459,PRISCILLA.,"Thus for a while he stood, and mused by the shore of the ocean,"
4460,PRISCILLA.,"Thinking of many things, and most of all of Priscilla;"
4461,PRISCILLA.,"And as if thought had the power to draw to itself, like the loadstone,"
4462,PRISCILLA.,"Whatsoever it touches, by subtile laws of its nature,                630"
4463,PRISCILLA.,"Lo! as he turned to depart, Priscilla was standing beside him."
4464,PRISCILLA.,
4465,PRISCILLA.,"""Are you so much offended, you will not speak to me?"" said she."

4467,PRISCILLA.,"Warmly the cause of another, my heart, impulsive and wayward,"
4468,PRISCILLA.,"Pleaded your own, and spake out, forgetful perhaps of decorum?       635"
4469,PRISCILLA.,"Certainly you can forgive me for speaking so frankly, for saying"
4470,PRISCILLA.,"What I ought not to have said, yet now I can never unsay it;"
4471,PRISCILLA.,"For there are moments in life, when the heart is so full of emotion,"

4474,PRISCILLA.,"Spilt on the ground like water, can never be gathered together."
4475,PRISCILLA.,"Yesterday I was shocked, when I heard you speak of Miles Standish,"
4476,PRISCILLA.,"Praising his virtues, transforming his very defects into virtues,"
4477,PRISCILLA.,"Praising his courage and strength, and even his fighting in Flanders,"
4478,PRISCILLA.,"As if by fighting alone you could win the heart of a woman,          645"
4479,PRISCILLA.,"Quite overlooking yourself and the rest, in exalting your hero."

4481,PRISCILLA.,"You will forgive me, I hope, for the sake of the friendship between us,"
4482,PRISCILLA.,"Which is too true and too sacred to be so easily broken!"""
4483,PRISCILLA.,"Thereupon answered John Alden, the scholar, the friend"

4485,PRISCILLA.,"""I was not angry with you, with myself alone I was angry,"
4486,PRISCILLA.,"Seeing how badly I managed the matter I had in my keeping."""
4487,PRISCILLA.,"""No!"" interrupted the maiden, with answer prompt, and decisive;"
4488,PRISCILLA.,"""No; you were angry with me, for speaking so frankly and freely."
4489,PRISCILLA.,"I was wrong, I acknowledge; for it is the fate of a woman            655"

4491,PRISCILLA.,Till some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence.
4492,PRISCILLA.,Hence is the inner life of so many suffering women
4493,PRISCILLA.,"Sunless and silent and deep, like subterranean rivers"

4496,PRISCILLA.,"Chafing their channels of stone, with endless and profitless murmurs."""
4497,PRISCILLA.,"Thereupon answered John Alden, the young man, the lover of women:"
4498,PRISCILLA.,"""Heaven forbid it, Priscilla; and truly they seem to me always"
4499,PRISCILLA.,"More like the beautiful rivers that watered the garden of Eden,[43]"
4500,PRISCILLA.,"More like the river Euphrates, through deserts of Havilah flowing,   665"
4501,PRISCILLA.,"Filling the land with delight, and memories sweet of the garden!"""
4502,PRISCILLA.,"""Ah, by these words, I can see,"" again interrupted the maiden,"
4503,PRISCILLA.,"""How very little you prize me, or care for what I am saying."
4504,PRISCILLA.,"When from the depths of my heart, in pain and with secret misgiving,"
4505,PRISCILLA.,"Frankly I speak to you, asking for sympathy only and kindness,       670"
4506,PRISCILLA.,"Straightway you take up my words, that are plain and direct"
4507,PRISCILLA.,"and in earnest,"
4508,PRISCILLA.,"Turn them away from their meaning, and answer with flattering phrases."
4509,PRISCILLA.,"This is not right, is not just, is not true to the best that is in you;"
4510,PRISCILLA.,"For I know and esteem you, and feel that your nature is noble,"
4511,PRISCILLA.,"Lifting mine up to a higher, a more ethereal level.                  675"
4512,PRISCILLA.,"Therefore I value your friendship, and feel it perhaps the more keenly"
4513,PRISCILLA.,"If you say aught that implies I am only as one among many,"
4514,PRISCILLA.,If you make use of those common and complimentary phrases
4515,PRISCILLA.,"Most men think so fine, in dealing and speaking with women,"
4516,PRISCILLA.,"But which women reject as insipid, if not as insulting.""             680"
4517,PRISCILLA.,
4518,PRISCILLA.,"Mute and amazed was Alden; and listened and looked at Priscilla,"
4519,PRISCILLA.,"Thinking he never had seen her more fair, more divine in her beauty."
4520,PRISCILLA.,"He who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the cause of another,"
4521,PRISCILLA.,"Stood there embarrassed and silent, and seeking in vain for an answer."
4522,PRISCILLA.,
4523,PRISCILLA.,"So the maiden went on, and little divined or imagined                685"
4524,PRISCILLA.,"What was at work in his heart, that made him so awkward and speechless."
4525,PRISCILLA.,"""Let us, then, be what we are, and speak what we think, and"
4526,PRISCILLA.,in all things
4527,PRISCILLA.,"Keep ourselves loyal to truth, and the sacred professions"
4528,PRISCILLA.,of friendship.
4529,PRISCILLA.,"It is no secret I tell you, nor am I ashamed to declare it:"
4530,PRISCILLA.,"I have liked to be with you, to see you, to speak with you always.   690"
4531,PRISCILLA.,"So I was hurt at your words, and a little affronted to hear you"
4532,PRISCILLA.,"Urge me to marry your friend, though he were the Captain"
4533,PRISCILLA.,Miles Standish.
4534,PRISCILLA.,For I must tell you the truth: much more to me is our friendship
4535,PRISCILLA.,"Than all the love he could give, were he twice the hero you think him."""
4536,PRISCILLA.,"Then she extended her hand, and Alden, who eagerly grasped it,       695"
4537,PRISCILLA.,"Felt all the wounds in his heart, that were aching and bleeding"
4538,PRISCILLA.,"so sorely,"
4539,PRISCILLA.,"Healed by the touch of that hand, and he said, with a voice"
4540,PRISCILLA.,full of feeling:
4541,PRISCILLA.,"""Yes, we must ever be friends; and of all who offer you friendship"
4542,PRISCILLA.,"Let me be ever the first, the truest, the nearest and dearest!"""
4543,PRISCILLA.,
4544,PRISCILLA.,Casting a farewell look at the glimmering sail of the Mayflower      700
4545,PRISCILLA.,"Distant, but still in sight, and sinking below the horizon,"
4546,PRISCILLA.,"Homeward together they walked, with a strange, indefinite feeling,"
4547,PRISCILLA.,That all the rest had departed and left them alone in the desert.
4548,PRISCILLA.,"But, as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile"
4549,PRISCILLA.,"of the sunshine,"
4550,PRISCILLA.,"Lighter grew their hearts, and Priscilla said very archly:           705"
4551,PRISCILLA.,"""Now that our terrible Captain has gone in pursuit of the Indians,"
4552,PRISCILLA.,"Where he is happier far than he would be commanding a household,"
4553,PRISCILLA.,"You may speak boldly, and tell me of all that happened between you,"
4554,PRISCILLA.,"When you returned last night, and said how ungrateful you found me."""
4555,PRISCILLA.,"Thereupon answered John Alden, and told her the whole"
4556,PRISCILLA.,"of the story,--                                                  710"
4557,PRISCILLA.,"Told her his own despair, and the direful wrath of Miles Standish."
4558,PRISCILLA.,"Whereat the maiden smiled, and said between laughing and earnest,"
4559,PRISCILLA.,"""He is a little chimney, and heated hot in a moment!"""
4560,PRISCILLA.,"But as he gently rebuked her, and told her how he had suffered,--"
4561,PRISCILLA.,"How he had even determined to sail that day in the Mayflower,        715"
4562,PRISCILLA.,"And had remained for her sake, on hearing the dangers"
4563,PRISCILLA.,"that threatened,--"
4564,PRISCILLA.,"All her manner was changed, and she said with a faltering accent,"
4565,PRISCILLA.,"""Truly I thank you for this: how good you have been to me always!"""
4566,PRISCILLA.,
4567,PRISCILLA.,"Thus, as a pilgrim devout, who toward Jerusalem journeys,"
4568,PRISCILLA.,"Taking three steps in advance, and one reluctantly backward,         730"
4569,PRISCILLA.,"Urged by importunate zeal, and withheld by pangs of contrition;"
4570,PRISCILLA.,"Slowly but steadily onward, receding yet ever advancing,"

4912,THE WEDDING-DAY.,"Brought out his snow-white bull, obeying the hand of its master.     995"
4913,THE WEDDING-DAY.,"Led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils,"

4915,THE WEDDING-DAY.,"She should not walk, he said, through the dust and heat of the noonday;"
4916,THE WEDDING-DAY.,"Nay, she should ride like a queen, not plod along like a peasant."
4917,THE WEDDING-DAY.,"Somewhat alarmed at first, but reassured by the others,             1000"

4932,THE WEDDING-DAY.,the fir-tree.
4933,THE WEDDING-DAY.,Wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of Eshcol.[59]
4934,THE WEDDING-DAY.,"Like a picture it seemed of the primitive, pastoral ages,"

5168,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"The chief hero of the Shahnamah is Rustum, the Hercules of Persian"
5169,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"mythology.  Rustum was the son of Zal, a renowned Persian warrior."
5170,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"When a mere child, he performed many wonderful deeds requiring great"
5171,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"strength and valor.  He became the champion of his people, restored"
5172,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"the Persian king to his throne, and defeated Afrasiab, the great"
5173,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Turanian, or Tartar, leader, who had invaded Persia.  During a"
5174,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"hunting expedition in Turan, his renowned horse Ruksh was stolen from"
5175,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"him, and in order to recover it, he was forced to call on the King of"
5176,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Samangam, a neighbouring city.  The king welcomed him, and gave him"
5177,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"his daughter Tahminah, in marriage.  Before the birth of his child,"
5178,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"however, Rustum was called back to Persia, but he left with Tahminah"
5179,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"a charm, or amulet, by which he might be able to recognize his"
5180,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"offspring.  When Sohrab, the son, was born, the mother, fearing that"
5181,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Rustum would return and take him away from her to bring him up as a
5182,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"soldier, sent word that a daughter had been born to him.  Rustum,"
5183,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"accordingly, did not return to Samangam, but remained in ignorance of"
5184,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Sohrab.  In the meantime, as Sohrab grew, up he became a great"
5185,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"warrior, and having learned that the renowned Rustum was his father,"
5186,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"he longed to meet him, that he might fight for him and help to make"
5187,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"him king.  At length the opportunity came.  The army of Afrasiab,"
5188,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"under the command of Peran-Wisa, invaded Persia once more, and Sohrab"
5189,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"accompanied the host.  The Persians prepared to meet the invaders,"
5190,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"and the two armies met at the river Oxus, which formed the boundary"
5191,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,between the two kingdoms. It is at this point that the story of

5199,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And the first grey of morning fill'd the east,"
5200,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And the fog rose out of the Oxus[1] stream.
5201,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,But all the Tartar[2] camp along the stream
5202,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Was hush'd, and still the men were plunged in sleep:"
5203,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Sohrab alone, he slept not: all night long                     5"
5204,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"He had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed;"

5206,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,"

5226,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Of rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms."
5227,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step"

5423,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay,"
5424,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Just pitch'd: the high pavilion in the midst                 190
5425,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Was Rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around."
5426,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And Gudurz enter'd Rustum's tent, and found"
5427,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Rustum: his morning meal was done, but still"

5431,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Listless, and held a falcon on his wrist,"
5432,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And play'd with it; but Gudurz came and stood
5433,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Before him; and he look'd, and saw him stand,"

5495,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,But who for men of nought would do great deeds?
5496,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Come, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame."
5497,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But I will fight unknown, and in plain arms;[24]"

5550,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Bristling, and in the midst, the open sand.                  295"
5551,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And Rustum came upon the sand, and cast"
5552,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His eyes towards the Tartar tents, and saw"
5553,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Sohrab come forth, and ey'd him as he came."
5554,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5555,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"As some rich woman, on a winter's morn,"
5556,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge             300
5557,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Who with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire--
5558,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"At cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn,"
5559,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,When the frost flowers the whiten'd window panes--
5560,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts"
5561,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum ey'd                   305
5562,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"The unknown adventurous youth, who from afar"
5563,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Came seeking Rustum, and defying forth"
5564,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,All the most valiant chiefs: long he perus'd[29]
5565,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His spirited air, and wonder'd who he was."
5566,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"For very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd;                   310"
5567,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,"
5568,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Which in a queen's secluded garden throws
5569,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,"
5570,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"By midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound--"
5571,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"So slender Sohrab seem'd, so softly rear'd.                  315"
5572,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And a deep pity enter'd Rustum's soul
5573,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"As he beheld him coming; and he stood,"
5574,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:--"
5575,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5576,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft,"
5577,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold.               320"
5578,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Heaven's air is better than the cold dead grave.
5579,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Behold me; I am vast, and clad in iron,"
5580,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And tried;[30] and I have stood on many a field
5581,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe:"
5582,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Never was that field lost, or that foe sav'd.                325"
5583,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?"
5584,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Be govern'd:[31] quit the Tartar host, and come"
5585,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"To Iran, and be as my son to me,"
5586,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And fight beneath my banner till I die.
5587,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"There are no youths in Iran brave as thou.""                  330"
5588,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5589,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5590,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"[_Sohrab has vague suspicions it is his father.  Rustum, in"

5592,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5593,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5594,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"So he spake, mildly: Sohrab heard his voice,"
5595,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,The mighty voice of Rustum; and he saw
5596,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His giant figure planted on the sand,"
5597,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Sole, like some single tower, which a chief"
5598,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Has builded on the waste in former years                     335
5599,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Against the robbers; and he saw that head,"
5600,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Streak'd with its first grey hairs: hope fill'd his soul;
5601,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And he ran forwards and embrac'd his knees,"
5602,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And clasp'd his hand within his own and said:--
5603,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5604,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Oh, by thy father's head! by thine own soul!                340"
5605,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Art thou not Rustum?  Speak! art thou not he!"""
5606,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5607,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But Rustum ey'd askance the kneeling youth,"
5608,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And turn'd away, and spoke to his own soul:--"
5609,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5610,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean,"
5611,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys.                345"
5612,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"For if I now confess this thing he asks,"
5613,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And hide it not, but say--_Rustum is here_--"
5614,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,"
5615,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But he will find some pretext not to fight,"
5616,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts.             350"
5617,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"A belt or sword perhaps, and go his way."
5618,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And on a feast day, in Afrasiab's hall,"
5619,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"In Samarcand, he will arise and cry--"
5620,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"'I challeng'd once, when the two armies camp'd"

5622,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,To cope with me in single fight; but they
5623,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Shrank; only Rustum dar'd: then he and I
5624,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Chang'd gifts,[32] and went on equal terms away.'"
5625,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud."
5626,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Then were the chiefs of Iran sham'd through me.""             360"
5627,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5628,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:--"
5629,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus"
5630,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Of Rustum?  I am here, whom thou hast call'd"
5631,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield."
5632,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Is it with Rustum only thou would'st fight?                  365
5633,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Rash boy, men look on Rustum's face and flee."
5634,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"For well I know, that did great Rustum stand"
5635,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Before thy face this day, and were reveal'd,"
5636,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,There would be then no talk of fighting more.
5637,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But being what I am, I tell thee this;                       370"
5638,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Do thou record it in thine inmost soul,"
5639,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt, and yield;"
5640,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds"
5641,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Bleach them, or Oxus with his summer floods,"
5642,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Oxus in summer wash them all away.""                          375"
5643,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"He spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his feet:--"
5644,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Art thou so fierce?  Thou wilt not fright me so."
5645,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"I am no girl, to be made pale by words."
5646,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand"
5647,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Here on this field, there were no fighting then,             380"
5648,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But Rustum is far hence, and we stand here."
5649,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Begin: thou art more vast, more dread than I,"
5650,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And thou art prov'd, I know, and I am young,--"
5651,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But yet success sways with the breath of heaven,[33]"
5652,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure              385
5653,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know."
5654,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"For we are all, like swimmers in the sea,"
5655,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Pois'd on the top of a huge wave of Fate,"
5656,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall.
5657,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And whether it will heave us up to land,                     390"
5658,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Or whether it will roll us out to sea,"
5659,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Back out to sea, to the deep waves of death,"
5660,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"We know not, and no search will make us know:"
5661,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Only the event will teach us in its hour."""

5667,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5668,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"He spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd                395"

5670,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,As on some partridge in the corn a hawk
5671,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,That long has tower'd in the airy clouds
5672,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Drops like a plummet;[34] Sohrab saw it come,"
5673,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And sprang aside, quick as a flash: the spear                400"
5674,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Hiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand,"
5675,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Which it sent flying wide: then Sohrab threw
5676,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"In turn, and full struck Rustum's shield: sharp rang,"
5677,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"The iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear."
5678,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And Rustum seiz'd his club, which none but he                405"
5679,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Could wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge,"
5680,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Still rough; like those which men in treeless plains
5681,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,"
5682,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Hyphasis or Hydaspes,[35] when, high up"

5687,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside
5688,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came               415"
5689,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Thundering to earth and leapt from Rustum's hand.
5690,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And Rustum follow'd his own blow and fell
5691,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"To his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand:"
5692,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And now might Sohrab have unsheath'd his sword,"
5693,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And pierc'd the mighty Rustum while he lay                   420
5694,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Dizzy, and on his knees, and chok'd with sand:"
5695,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But he look'd on, and smil'd, nor bar'd his sword,"
5696,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:--"

5701,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul."
5702,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Thou say'st thou art not Rustum: be it so.

5706,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And heard their hollow roar of dying men;

5760,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And you would say that sun and stars took part

5762,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Grew suddenly in heaven, and dark'd the sun"
5763,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose                    480
5764,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,"
5765,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair.
5766,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"In gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone;"
5767,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,For both the on-looking hosts on either hand
5768,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,               485"
5769,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.
5770,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes"
5771,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield
5772,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Which Sohrab held stiff out: the steel-spik'd spear
5773,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Rent the tough plates, but failed to reach the skin,         490"
5774,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And Rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan.
5775,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,"
5776,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest
5777,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"He shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,"
5778,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Never till now defil'd, sunk to the dust;                    495"
5779,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And Rustum bow'd his bead; but then the gloom
5780,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Grew blacker: thunder rumbled in the air,"
5781,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,"
5782,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Who stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry:"
5783,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"No horse's cry was that, most like the roar                  500"
5784,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Of some pain'd desert lion, who all day"

5789,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on,"
5790,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And struck again; and again Rustum bow'd
5791,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,"
5792,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,"
5793,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And in his hand the hilt remain'd alone.                     510

5797,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And shrank amaz'd: back he recoil'd one step,"
5798,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form;           515
5799,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd
5800,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His covering shield, and the spear pierc'd his side."
5801,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"He reel'd, and staggering back, sunk to the ground."
5802,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And then the gloom dispers'd, and the wind fell,"
5803,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all               520"

5813,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill                 525"
5814,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,"
5815,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent.
5816,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Or else that the great Rustum would come down
5817,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move"
5818,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His heart to take a gift, and let thee go.                   530"
5819,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And then that all the Tartar host would praise
5820,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,"
5821,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,To glad thy father in his weak old age.
5822,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Fool! thou art slain, and by an unknown man!"
5823,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Dearer to the red jackals shall thou be,                     535"
5824,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Than to thy friends, and to thy father old."""
5825,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5826,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And with a fearless mien Sohrab replied:--
5827,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain."
5828,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!"
5829,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"No!  Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.                 540"
5830,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"For were I match'd with ten such men as thou,"
5831,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And I were he who till to-day I was,"
5832,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"They should be lying here, I standing there."
5833,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,But that beloved name unnerv'd my arm--
5834,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"That name, and something, I confess, in thee,                545"
5835,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield"
5836,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Fall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe.
5837,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate."
5838,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear!"
5839,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!                     550
5840,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"My father, whom I seek through all the world,"
5841,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!"""
5842,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5843,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,As when some hunter in the spring hath found
5844,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,"
5845,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Upon the craggy isle of a hill lake,                         555"
5846,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And pierc'd her with an arrow as she rose,"
5847,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And follow'd her to find her where she fell
5848,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Far off;--anon her mate comes winging back
5849,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"From hunting, and a great way off descries"
5850,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His huddling young left sole; at that, he checks             560"
5851,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps"
5852,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Circles above his eyry, with loud screams"
5853,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she
5854,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,"
5855,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"In some far stony gorge out of his ken,                      565"
5856,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,A heap of fluttering feathers: never more
5857,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Shall the lake glass her, flying over it;"
5858,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Never the black and dripping precipices
5859,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Echo her stormy scream as she sails by:--
5860,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,            570"
5861,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood"
5862,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Over his dying son, and knew him not."
5863,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5864,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5865,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"[_Rustum anxiously says he never had a son, but only a daughter_.]"
5866,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5867,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5868,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But with a cold, incredulous voice, he said:--"
5869,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""What prate is this of fathers and revenge?"
5870,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"The mighty Rustum never had a son.""                          575"
5871,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5872,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:--"
5873,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I."
5874,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Surely the news will one day reach his ear,"
5875,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,"
5876,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;              580"
5877,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap"
5878,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee."
5879,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!"
5880,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"What will that grief, what will that vengeance be!"
5881,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Oh, could I live, till I that grief had seen!                585"
5882,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Yet him I pity not so much, but her,"
5883,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells"
5884,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"With that old king, her father, who grows grey"
5885,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"With age, and rules over the valiant Koords.[39]"
5886,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Her most I pity, who no more will see                        590"
5887,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,"
5888,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"With spoils and honour, when the war is done."
5889,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But a dark rumour will be bruited up,[40]"
5890,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;"
5891,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And then will that defenceless woman learn                   595
5892,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,"
5893,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But that in battle with a nameless foe,"
5894,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"By the far distant Oxus, he is slain."""
5895,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5896,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5897,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,[_The truth breaks in upon Rustum.  Again he charges Sohrab with a
5898,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,false tale_.]
5899,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5900,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5901,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"He spoke; and as he ceas'd he wept aloud,"
5902,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Thinking of her he left, and his own death.                  600"
5903,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"He spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plung'd in thought."
5904,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Nor did he yet believe it was his son
5905,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Who spoke, although he call'd back names he knew"
5906,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"For he had had sure tidings that the babe,"
5907,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Which was in Ader-baijan born to him,                        605"
5908,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Had been a puny girl, no boy at all:"
5909,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"So that sad mother sent him word, for fear"
5910,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Rustum should take the boy, to train in arms;"
5911,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And so he deem'd that either Sohrab took,"
5912,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"By a false boast, the style[41] of Rustum's son;             610"
5913,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame."
5914,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"So deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plung'd in thought;"
5915,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide"
5916,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Of the bright rocking ocean sets to shore
5917,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,At the full moon: tears gathered in his eyes;                615
5918,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"For he remembered his own early youth,"
5919,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,"
5920,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,The shepherd from his mountain lodge descries
5921,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"A far bright city, smitten by the sun,"
5922,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Through many rolling clouds;--so Rustum saw                  620
5923,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;"
5924,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And that old king, her father, who lov'd well"
5925,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child"
5926,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,"
5927,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"They three, in that long-distant summer-time--               625"
5928,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt"
5929,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And hound, and morn on those delightful hills"
5930,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"In Ader-baijan.  And he saw that youth,"
5931,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Of age and looks to be his own dear son,"
5932,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand,                       630"
5933,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Like some rich hyacinth, which by the scythe"
5934,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,"
5935,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,"
5936,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,"
5937,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"On the mown, dying grass;--so Sohrab lay,                    635"
5938,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Lovely in death, upon the common sand."
5939,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And Rustum gaz'd on him with grief, and said:--"
5940,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5941,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son"
5942,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have lov'd!"
5943,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men                    640"
5944,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Have told thee false;--thou art not Rustum's son.
5945,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,For Rustum had no son: one child he had--
5946,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,But one--a girl; who with her mother now
5947,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us--"
5948,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.""               645"
5949,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5950,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,But Sohrab answer'd him in wrath; for now
5951,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"The anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce,"
5952,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And he desired to draw forth the steel,"
5953,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And let the blood flow free, and so to die,"
5954,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,But first he would convince his stubborn foe--               650
5955,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:--"
5956,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5957,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5958,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"[_Sohrab discloses the mark by which he was to be known.  ""O boy--thy"

5960,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5961,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5962,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?"
5963,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Truth sits upon the lips of dying men,"
5964,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And Falsehood, while I liv'd, was far from mine."
5965,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"I tell thee, prick'd upon this arm I bear                    655"
5966,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,"
5967,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"That she might prick it on the babe she bore."""
5968,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5969,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,He spoke: and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks;
5970,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand,"
5971,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Against his breast, his heavy mailed hand,                   660"
5972,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,That the hard iron corslet clank'd aloud;
5973,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And to his heart he press'd the other hand,"
5974,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And in a hollow voice he spake, and said:--"
5975,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5976,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie."
5977,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"If thou shew this, then art thou Rustum's son.""              665"
5978,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
5979,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loos'd"
5980,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His belt, and near the shoulder bar'd his arm,"
5981,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And shew'd a sign in faint vermilion points
5982,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Prick'd: as a cunning workman, in Pekin,"
5983,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,             670"
5984,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"An emperor's gift--at early morn he paints,"
5985,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp"
5986,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands:--
5987,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,So delicately prick'd the sign appear'd[42]
5988,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"On Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal.                  675"
5989,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"It was that griffin, which of old rear'd Zal,[43]"
5990,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Rustum's great father, whom they left to die,"
5991,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"A helpless babe, among the mountain rocks."
5992,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Him that kind creature found, and rear'd and lov'd--"
5993,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.                   680
5994,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And Sohrab bar'd that figure on his arm,"
5995,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes,"
5996,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And then he touch'd it with his hand and said:--
5997,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""How say'st thou?  Is that sign the proper sign"
5998,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Of Rustum's son, or of some other man's?""                    685"
5999,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"He spoke: but Rustum gaz'd, and gaz'd, and stood"
6000,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Speechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry--
6001,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,_O boy--thy father_!--and his voice chok'd there.
6002,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes,"
6003,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And his head swam, and he sunk down to earth.                690"
6004,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast"
6005,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips,"
6006,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And with fond faltering fingers strok'd his cheeks,"
6007,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Trying to call him back to life: and life
6008,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Came back to Rustum, and he op'd his eyes,                   695"
6009,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And they stood wide with horror; and he seiz'd
6010,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"In both his hands the dust which lay around,"
6011,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,"
6012,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms:"
6013,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,            700"
6014,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And his sobs chok'd him; and he clutch'd his sword,"
6015,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"To draw it, and for ever let life out."
6016,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,"
6017,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And with a soothing voice he spoke, and said:--"
6018,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
6019,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
6020,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"[_Father and son embrace.  ""Would that the Oxus were flowing over"

6024,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Father, forbear: for I but meet to-day                      705"
6025,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,The doom that at my birth was written down
6026,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"In Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand."
6027,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,"
6028,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,"
6029,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,I know it: but fate trod those promptings down               710
6030,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Under its iron heel; fate, fate engag'd"
6031,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"The strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear."
6032,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,But let us speak no more of this: I find
6033,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,My father; let me feel that I have found.
6034,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take                   715"
6035,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,"

6037,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Quick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life,"
6038,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And swift; for like the lightning to this field
6039,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"I came, and like the wind I go away--                        720"
6040,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind,"
6041,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But it was writ in Heaven that this should be."""
6042,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
6043,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,So said he: and his voice releas'd the heart
6044,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Of Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast"
6045,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,               725"
6046,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And kiss'd him.  And awe fell on both the hosts
6047,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse,"
6048,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"With his head bowing to the ground, and mane"
6049,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe"
6050,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,First to the one then to the other mov'd                     730
6051,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"His head, as if enquiring what their grief"
6052,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,"
6053,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"The big warm tears roll'd down, and cak'd the sand."
6054,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:--"
6055,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
6056,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet            735"
6057,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Should then have rotted on thy nimble joints,"
6058,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"When first they bore thy master to this field."""
6059,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,
6060,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,But Sohrab look'd upon the horse and said:--
6061,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"""Is this then Ruksh?  How often, in past days,"
6062,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed!                 740"
6063,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"My terrible father's terrible horse; and said,"
6064,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"That I should one day find thy lord and thee,"
6065,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane."
6066,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;"
6067,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"For thou hast gone where I shall never go,                   745"
6068,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And snuff'd the breezes of my father's home.
6069,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,"
6070,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"And seen the river of Helmund,[44] and the lake"
6071,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself
6072,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Has often strok'd thy neck, and given thee food,             750"
6073,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Corn in a golden platter soak'd with wine,"
6074,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,And said--'O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!'--but I
6075,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Have never known my grandsire's furrow'd face,"
6076,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM.,"Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,"
