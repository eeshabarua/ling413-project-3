70,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,_A little bit of a woman came
71,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,Athwart my path one day;
72,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,So tiny was she that she seemed to be
73,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"A pixy strayed from the misty sea,"
74,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,Or a wandering greenwood fay._
75,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,
76,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"_""Oho, you little elf!"" I cried,"
77,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"""And what are you doing here?"
78,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,So tiny as you will never do
79,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,For the brutal rush and hullaballoo
80,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"Of this practical world, I fear.""_"
81,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,
82,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"_""Voice have I, good sir,"" said she.--"
83,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"""'Tis soft as an Angel's sigh,"
84,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,But to fancy a word of yours were heard
85,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"In all the din of this world's absurd!"""
86,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"Smiling, I made reply._"
87,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,
88,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"_""Hands have I, good sir"" she quoth.--"
89,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"""Marry, and that have you!"
90,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,But amid the strife and the tumult rife
91,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"In all the struggle and battle for life,"
92,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"What can those wee hands do?""_"
93,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,
94,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"_""Eyes have I, good sir,"" she said.--"
95,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"""Sooth, you have,"" quoth I,"

97,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"And they betimes shall dim with woe,"
98,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"As the hard, hard years go by!""_"
99,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,
100,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,_That little bit of a woman cast
101,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"Her two eyes full on me,"

105,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,
106,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,_That little bit of a woman's hands
107,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,Reached up into my breast
108,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"And rent apart my scoffing heart,--"
109,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,And they buffet it still with such sweet art
110,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,As cannot be expressed._
111,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,
112,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,_That little bit of a woman's voice
113,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,Hath grown most wondrous dear;
114,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,Above the blare of all elsewhere
115,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,(An inspiration that mocks at care)
116,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,It riseth full and clear._
117,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,
118,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,"_Dear one, I bless the subtle power"
119,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,That makes me wholly thine;
120,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,And I'm proud to say that I bless the day
121,BY JULIA SUTHERLAND FIELD.,When a little woman wrought her way

294,FATHER'S WAY.,
295,FATHER'S WAY.,"MY father was no pessimist; he loved the things of earth,--"
296,FATHER'S WAY.,"Its cheerfulness and sunshine, its music and its mirth."
297,FATHER'S WAY.,"He never sighed or moped around whenever things went wrong,--"
298,FATHER'S WAY.,I warrant me he'd mocked at fate with some defiant song;
299,FATHER'S WAY.,"But, being he warn't much on tune, when times looked sort o' blue,"
300,FATHER'S WAY.,"He'd whistle softly to himself this only tune he knew,--"
301,FATHER'S WAY.,
302,FATHER'S WAY.,[Illustration: Music]
303,FATHER'S WAY.,
304,FATHER'S WAY.,"Now mother, when she heard that tune which father whistled so,"
305,FATHER'S WAY.,"Would say, ""There's something wrong to-day with Ephraim, I know;"
306,FATHER'S WAY.,He never tries to make believe he's happy that 'ere way
307,FATHER'S WAY.,"But that I'm certain as can be there's somethin' wrong to pay."""
308,FATHER'S WAY.,"And so betimes, quite natural-like, to us observant youth"
309,FATHER'S WAY.,"There seemed suggestion in that tune of deep, pathetic truth."
310,FATHER'S WAY.,
311,FATHER'S WAY.,"When Brother William joined the war, a lot of us went down"
312,FATHER'S WAY.,To see the gallant soldier boys right gayly out of town.
313,FATHER'S WAY.,"A-comin' home, poor mother cried as if her heart would break,"
314,FATHER'S WAY.,"And all us children, too,--for _hers_, and _not_ for _William's_ sake!"
315,FATHER'S WAY.,"But father, trudgin' on ahead, his hands behind him so,"
316,FATHER'S WAY.,"Kept whistlin' to himself, so sort of solemn-like and low."
317,FATHER'S WAY.,
318,FATHER'S WAY.,"And when my oldest sister, Sue, was married and went West,"
319,FATHER'S WAY.,Seemed like it took the tuck right out of mother and the rest.
320,FATHER'S WAY.,"She was the sunlight in our home,--why, father used to say"
321,FATHER'S WAY.,It wouldn't seem like home at all if Sue should go away;
322,FATHER'S WAY.,"But when she went, a-leavin' us all sorrer and all tears,"
323,FATHER'S WAY.,Poor father whistled lonesome-like--and went to feed the steers.
324,FATHER'S WAY.,
325,FATHER'S WAY.,"When crops were bad, and other ills befell our homely lot,"
326,FATHER'S WAY.,He'd set of nights and try to act as if he minded not;
327,FATHER'S WAY.,"And when came death and bore away the one he worshipped so,"
328,FATHER'S WAY.,How vainly did his lips belie the heart benumbed with woe!
329,FATHER'S WAY.,"You see the telltale whistle told a mood he'd not admit,--"
330,FATHER'S WAY.,He'd always stopped his whistlin' when he thought we noticed it.
331,FATHER'S WAY.,
332,FATHER'S WAY.,"I'd like to see that stooping form and hoary head again,--"
333,FATHER'S WAY.,"To see the honest, hearty smile that cheered his fellow-men."
334,FATHER'S WAY.,"Oh, could I kiss the kindly lips that spake no creature wrong,"
335,FATHER'S WAY.,And share the rapture of the heart that overflowed with song!
336,FATHER'S WAY.,"Oh, could I hear the little tune he whistled long ago,"
337,FATHER'S WAY.,When he did battle with the griefs he would not have _us_ know!

732,DEAR OLD LONDON.,
733,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"WHEN I was broke in London in the fall of '89,"
734,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"I chanced to spy in Oxford Street this tantalizing sign,--"
735,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"""A Splendid Horace cheap for Cash!"" Of course I had to look"
736,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"Upon the vaunted bargain, and it was a noble book!"
737,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"A finer one I've never seen, nor can I hope to see,--"
738,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"The first edition, richly bound, and clean as clean can be;"
739,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"And, just to think, for three-pounds-ten I might have had that Pine,"
740,DEAR OLD LONDON.,When I was broke in London in the fall of '89!
741,DEAR OLD LONDON.,
742,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"Down at Noseda's, in the Strand, I found, one fateful day,"
743,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"A portrait that I pined for as only maniac may,--"
744,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"A print of Madame Vestris (she flourished years ago,"
745,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"Was Bartolozzi's daughter and a thoroughbred, you know)."
746,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"A clean and handsome print it was, and cheap at thirty bob,--"
747,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"That's what I told the salesman, as I choked a rising sob;"
748,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"But I hung around Noseda's as it were a holy shrine,"
749,DEAR OLD LONDON.,When I was broke in London in the fall of '89.
750,DEAR OLD LONDON.,
751,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"At Davey's, in Great Russell Street, were autographs galore,"
752,DEAR OLD LONDON.,And Mr. Davey used to let me con that precious store.
753,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"Sometimes I read what warriors wrote, sometimes a king's command,"
754,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"But oftener still a poet's verse, writ in a meagre hand."
755,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"Lamb, Byron, Addison, and Burns, Pope, Johnson, Swift, and Scott,--"
756,DEAR OLD LONDON.,It needed but a paltry sum to comprehend the lot;
757,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"Yet, though Friend Davey marked 'em down, what could I but decline?"
758,DEAR OLD LONDON.,For I was broke in London in the fall of '89.
759,DEAR OLD LONDON.,
760,DEAR OLD LONDON.,Of antique swords and spears I saw a vast and dazzling heap
761,DEAR OLD LONDON.,That Curio Fenton offered me at prices passing cheap;
762,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"And, oh, the quaint old bureaus, and the warming-pans of brass,"
763,DEAR OLD LONDON.,And the lovely hideous freaks I found in pewter and in glass!
764,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"And, oh, the sideboards, candlesticks, the cracked old china plates,"
765,DEAR OLD LONDON.,The clocks and spoons from Amsterdam that antedate all dates!
766,DEAR OLD LONDON.,Of such superb monstrosities I found an endless mine
767,DEAR OLD LONDON.,When I was broke in London in the fall of '89.
768,DEAR OLD LONDON.,
769,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"O ye that hanker after boons that others idle by,--"
770,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"The battered things that please the soul, though they may vex the"
771,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"eye,--"
772,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"The silver plate and crockery all sanctified with grime,"
773,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"The oaken stuff that has defied the tooth of envious Time,"
774,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"The musty tomes, the speckled prints, the mildewed bills of play,"
775,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"And other costly relics of malodorous decay,--"
776,DEAR OLD LONDON.,Ye only can appreciate what agony was mine
777,DEAR OLD LONDON.,When I was broke in London in the fall of '89.
778,DEAR OLD LONDON.,
779,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"When, in the course of natural things, I go to my reward,"
780,DEAR OLD LONDON.,Let no imposing epitaph my martyrdoms record;
781,DEAR OLD LONDON.,"Neither in Hebrew, Latin, Greek, nor any classic tongue,"
782,DEAR OLD LONDON.,Let my ten thousand triumphs over human griefs be sung;
783,DEAR OLD LONDON.,But in plain Anglo-Saxon--that he may know who seeks
784,DEAR OLD LONDON.,What agonizing pangs I've had while on the hunt for freaks--
785,DEAR OLD LONDON.,Let there be writ upon the slab that marks my grave this line:

2271,CARLSBAD.,"To corpulency you were prone, dyspepsia bothered me,--"
2272,CARLSBAD.,You tipped the beam at twenty stone and I at ten stone three!
2273,CARLSBAD.,"The cure, they told us, works both ways: it makes the fat man lean;"
2274,CARLSBAD.,"The thin man, after many days, achieves a portly mien;"
2275,CARLSBAD.,"And though it's true you still are fat, while I am like a crow,--"
2276,CARLSBAD.,"All skin and feathers,--what of that? The cure takes time, you know."
2277,CARLSBAD.,
2278,CARLSBAD.,"The Carlsbad scenery is sublime,--that's what the guide-books say;"
2279,CARLSBAD.,"We did not think so at that time, nor think _I_ so to-day!"
2280,CARLSBAD.,"The bluffs that squeeze the panting town permit no pleasing views,"

2286,CARLSBAD.,
2287,CARLSBAD.,"We never scaled the mountain-side, for walking was my bane,"
2288,CARLSBAD.,And you were much too big to ride the mules that there obtain;
2289,CARLSBAD.,"And so we loitered in the shade with Israel out in force,"
2290,CARLSBAD.,Or through the Pupp'sche allee strayed and heard the band discourse.
2291,CARLSBAD.,"Sometimes it pleased us to recline upon the Tepl's brink,"

2294,CARLSBAD.,When you were weighing twenty stone and I but ten stone three!
2295,CARLSBAD.,
2296,CARLSBAD.,"And oh! those awful things to eat! No pudding, cake, or pie,"

2309,CARLSBAD.,"To flounder in those rains of June that flood that Austrian vale,"
2310,CARLSBAD.,To quaff that tepid Kaiserbrunn and starve on victuals stale!
2311,CARLSBAD.,"And often, leagues and leagues away from where we suffered then,"
2312,CARLSBAD.,With envious yearnings I survey what cannot be again!
2313,CARLSBAD.,

2317,CARLSBAD.,To feel the pressure of your hand and hear your voice once more;
2318,CARLSBAD.,"And, better yet, my heart is warm with thoughts of you and yours,"

2556,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,"I'll say without reserve,"
2557,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,"There is no torment like to thee,"

2559,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,
2560,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,"This subtle, envious nerve appears"
2561,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,"To be a patient foe,--"
2562,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,It waited nearly forty years
2563,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,Its chance to lay me low;
2564,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,"Then, like some blithering blast of hell,"
2565,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,"It struck this guileless bard,"
2566,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,And in that evil hour I fell
2567,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,Prodigious far and hard.
2568,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,Alas! what things I dearly love--
2569,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,"Pies, puddings, and preserves--"
2570,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,Are sure to rouse the vengeance of
2571,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,All pneumogastric nerves!
2572,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,
2573,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,Oh that I could remodel man!
2574,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,I'd end these cruel pains
2575,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,By hitting on a different plan
2576,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,From that which now obtains.
2577,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,"The stomach, greatly amplified,"
2578,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,Anon should occupy

2580,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,Where heart and lungs now lie.
2581,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,"But, first of all, I should depose"
2582,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,That diabolic curve
2583,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,"And author of my thousand woes,"
2584,THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.,The pneumogastric nerve!

2589,TEENY-WEENY.,TEENY-WEENY.
2590,TEENY-WEENY.,
2591,TEENY-WEENY.,
2592,TEENY-WEENY.,"EVERY evening, after tea,"
2593,TEENY-WEENY.,"Teeny-Weeny comes to me,"
2594,TEENY-WEENY.,"And, astride my willing knee,"
2595,TEENY-WEENY.,Plies his lash and rides away;
2596,TEENY-WEENY.,"Though that palfrey, all too spare,"
2597,TEENY-WEENY.,"Finds his burden hard to bear,"
2598,TEENY-WEENY.,"Teeny-Weeny doesn't care,--"
2599,TEENY-WEENY.,"He commands, and I obey!"
2600,TEENY-WEENY.,
2601,TEENY-WEENY.,"First it's trot; and gallop then,--"
2602,TEENY-WEENY.,Now it's back to trot again;
2603,TEENY-WEENY.,Teeny-Weeny likes it when
2604,TEENY-WEENY.,He is riding fierce and fast!
2605,TEENY-WEENY.,Then his dark eyes brighter grow
2606,TEENY-WEENY.,"And his cheeks are all aglow,--"
2607,TEENY-WEENY.,"""More!"" he cries, and never ""Whoa!"""
2608,TEENY-WEENY.,Till the horse breaks down at last!
2609,TEENY-WEENY.,
2610,TEENY-WEENY.,"Oh, the strange and lovely sights"
2611,TEENY-WEENY.,"Teeny-Weeny sees of nights,"
2612,TEENY-WEENY.,As he makes those famous flights
2613,TEENY-WEENY.,On that wondrous horse of his!
2614,TEENY-WEENY.,"Oftentimes, before he knows,"
2615,TEENY-WEENY.,"Wearylike his eyelids close,"
2616,TEENY-WEENY.,"And, still smiling, off he goes"
2617,TEENY-WEENY.,Where the land of By-low is.
2618,TEENY-WEENY.,
2619,TEENY-WEENY.,There he sees the folk of fay
2620,TEENY-WEENY.,"Hard at ring-a-rosie play,"
2621,TEENY-WEENY.,"And he hears those fairies say,"
2622,TEENY-WEENY.,"""Come, let's chase him to and fro!"""
2623,TEENY-WEENY.,"But, with a defiant shout,"
2624,TEENY-WEENY.,"Teeny puts that host to rout,--"
2625,TEENY-WEENY.,"Of this tale I make no doubt,--"
2626,TEENY-WEENY.,Every night he tells it so!
2627,TEENY-WEENY.,
2628,TEENY-WEENY.,So I feel a tender pride
2629,TEENY-WEENY.,In my boy who dares to ride
2630,TEENY-WEENY.,(That fierce horse of his astride)
2631,TEENY-WEENY.,Off into those misty lands;
2632,TEENY-WEENY.,"And as on my breast he lies,"
2633,TEENY-WEENY.,"Dreaming in that wondrous wise,"
2634,TEENY-WEENY.,"I caress his folded eyes,--"
2635,TEENY-WEENY.,Pat his little dimpled hands.
2636,TEENY-WEENY.,
2637,TEENY-WEENY.,"On a time he went away,"
2638,TEENY-WEENY.,"Just a little while to stay,"
2639,TEENY-WEENY.,And I'm not ashamed to say
2640,TEENY-WEENY.,I was very lonely then;
2641,TEENY-WEENY.,"Life without him was so sad,"
2642,TEENY-WEENY.,You can fancy I was glad
2643,TEENY-WEENY.,And made merry when I had
2644,TEENY-WEENY.,Teeny-Weeny back again!
2645,TEENY-WEENY.,
2646,TEENY-WEENY.,"So of evenings, after tea,"
2647,TEENY-WEENY.,When he toddles up to me
2648,TEENY-WEENY.,"And goes tugging at my knee,"
2649,TEENY-WEENY.,You should hear his palfrey neigh!
2650,TEENY-WEENY.,"You should see him prance and shy,"
2651,TEENY-WEENY.,"When, with an exulting cry,"
2652,TEENY-WEENY.,"Teeny-Weeny, vaulting high,"
2653,TEENY-WEENY.,Plies his lash and rides away!

2659,TELKA.,
2660,TELKA.,
2661,TELKA.,THROUGH those golden summer days
2662,TELKA.,Our twin flocks were wont to graze
2663,TELKA.,"On the hillside, which the sun"
2664,TELKA.,"Rested lovingly upon,--"
2665,TELKA.,Telka's flock and mine; and we
2666,TELKA.,"Sung our songs in rapturous glee,"
2667,TELKA.,Idling in the pleasant shade
2668,TELKA.,"Which the solemn Yew-tree made,"
2669,TELKA.,"While the Brook anear us played,"
2670,TELKA.,"And a white Rose, ghost-like, grew"
2671,TELKA.,In the shadow of the Yew.
2672,TELKA.,
2673,TELKA.,Telka loved me passing well;
2674,TELKA.,How I loved her none can tell!
2675,TELKA.,"How I love her none may know,--"
2676,TELKA.,Oh that man love woman so!
2677,TELKA.,"When she was not at my side,"
2678,TELKA.,"Loud my heart in anguish cried,"
2679,TELKA.,"And my lips, till she replied."
2680,TELKA.,"Yet they think to silence me,--"
2681,TELKA.,As if love could silenced be!
2682,TELKA.,"Fool were I, and fools were they!"
2683,TELKA.,"Still I wend my lonely way,"
2684,TELKA.,"""Telka,"" evermore I cry;"
2685,TELKA.,"Answer me the woods and sky,"
2686,TELKA.,And the weary years go by.
2687,TELKA.,
2688,TELKA.,"Telka, she was passing fair;"
2689,TELKA.,And the glory of her hair
2690,TELKA.,Was such glory as the sun
2691,TELKA.,With his blessing casts upon
2692,TELKA.,"Yonder lonely mountain height,"
2693,TELKA.,Lifting up to bid good-night
2694,TELKA.,"To her sovereign in the west,"
2695,TELKA.,"Sinking wearily to rest,"
2696,TELKA.,Drowsing in that golden sea
2697,TELKA.,Where the realms of Dreamland be.
2698,TELKA.,
2699,TELKA.,"So our love to fulness grew,"
2700,TELKA.,Whilst beneath the solemn Yew
2701,TELKA.,"Ghost-like paled the Rose of white,"
2702,TELKA.,As it were some fancied sight
2703,TELKA.,Blanched it with a dread affright.
2704,TELKA.,
2705,TELKA.,"Telka, she was passing fair;"
2706,TELKA.,And our peace was perfect there
2707,TELKA.,"Till, enchanted by her smile,"
2708,TELKA.,"Lurked the South Wind there awhile,"
2709,TELKA.,Underneath that hillside tree
2710,TELKA.,"Where with singing idled we,"
2711,TELKA.,And I heard the South Wind say
2712,TELKA.,Flattering words to her that day
2713,TELKA.,Of a city far away.
2714,TELKA.,But the Yew-tree crouched as though
2715,TELKA.,It were like to whisper No
2716,TELKA.,To the words the South Wind said
2717,TELKA.,As he smoothed my Telka's head.
2718,TELKA.,"And the Brook, all pleading, cried"
2719,TELKA.,To the dear one at my side:
2720,TELKA.,"""Linger always where I am;"
2721,TELKA.,"Stray not thence, O cosset lamb!"
2722,TELKA.,Wander not where shadows deep
2723,TELKA.,"On the treacherous quicksands sleep,"
2724,TELKA.,And the haunted waters leap;
2725,TELKA.,Be thou ware the waves that flow
2726,TELKA.,"Toward the prison pool below,"
2727,TELKA.,"Where, beguiled from yonder sky,"
2728,TELKA.,"Captive moonbeams shivering lie,"
2729,TELKA.,"And at dawn of morrow die."""
2730,TELKA.,"So the Brook to Telka cried,"
2731,TELKA.,But my Telka naught replied;
2732,TELKA.,"And, as in a strange affright,"
2733,TELKA.,Paled the Rose a ghostlier white.
2734,TELKA.,
2735,TELKA.,"When anon the North Wind came,--"
2736,TELKA.,"Rudely blustering Telka's name,"
2737,TELKA.,And he kissed the leaves that grew
2738,TELKA.,"Round about the trembling Yew,--"
2739,TELKA.,"Kissed and romped till, blushing red,"
2740,TELKA.,"All one day in terror fled,"
2741,TELKA.,And the white Rose hung her head;
2742,TELKA.,"Coming to our trysting spot,"
2743,TELKA.,Long I called; she answered not.
2744,TELKA.,"""Telka!"" pleadingly I cried"
2745,TELKA.,Up and down the mountain-side
2746,TELKA.,Where we twain were wont to bide.
2747,TELKA.,
2748,TELKA.,There were those who thought that I
2749,TELKA.,"Could be silenced with a lie,"
2750,TELKA.,And they told me Telka's name
2751,TELKA.,Should be spoken now with shame:
2752,TELKA.,"""She is lost to us and thee,""--"
2753,TELKA.,That is what they said to me.
2754,TELKA.,
2755,TELKA.,"""Is my Telka lost?"" quoth I."
2756,TELKA.,"""On this hilltop shall I cry,"
2757,TELKA.,So that she may hear and then
2758,TELKA.,Find her way to me again.
2759,TELKA.,The South Wind spoke a lie that day;
2760,TELKA.,"All deceived, she lost her way"
2761,TELKA.,Yonder where the shadows sleep
2762,TELKA.,'Mongst the haunted waves that leap
2763,TELKA.,"Over treacherous quicksands deep,"
2764,TELKA.,And where captive moonbeams lie
2765,TELKA.,Doomed at morrow's dawn to die
2766,TELKA.,"She is lost, and that is all;"
2767,TELKA.,"I will search for her, and call."""
2768,TELKA.,
2769,TELKA.,"Summer comes and winter goes,"
2770,TELKA.,Buds the Yew and blooms the Rose;
2771,TELKA.,"All the others are anear,--"
2772,TELKA.,Only Telka is not here!
2773,TELKA.,Gone the peace and love I knew
2774,TELKA.,Sometime 'neath the hillside Yew;
2775,TELKA.,"And the Rose, that mocks me so,"
2776,TELKA.,I had crushed it long ago
2777,TELKA.,"But that Telka loved it then,"
2778,TELKA.,And shall soothe its terror when
2779,TELKA.,She comes back to me again.
2780,TELKA.,"Call I, seek I everywhere"
2781,TELKA.,"For my Telka, passing fair."
2782,TELKA.,"It is, oh, so many a year"
2783,TELKA.,"I have called! She does not hear,"
2784,TELKA.,Yet nor feared nor worn am I;
2785,TELKA.,For I know that if I cry
2786,TELKA.,She shall sometime hear my call.
2787,TELKA.,"She is lost, and that is all,--"
2788,TELKA.,She is lost in some far spot;
2789,TELKA.,"I have searched, and found it not."
2790,TELKA.,"Could she hear me calling, then"
2791,TELKA.,Would she come to me again;
2792,TELKA.,"For she loved me passing well,--"
2793,TELKA.,How I love her none can tell!
2794,TELKA.,That is why these years I've cried
2795,TELKA.,"""Telka!"" on this mountain-side."
2796,TELKA.,"""Telka!"" still I, pleading, cry;"
2797,TELKA.,"Answer me the woods and sky,"
2798,TELKA.,And the lonely years go by.
2799,TELKA.,
2800,TELKA.,On an evening dark and chill
2801,TELKA.,"Came a shadow up the hill,--"
2802,TELKA.,"Came a spectre, grim and white"
2803,TELKA.,"As a ghost that walks the night,"
2804,TELKA.,"Grim and bowed, and with the cry"
2805,TELKA.,"Of a wretch about to die,--"
2806,TELKA.,Came and fell and cried to me:
2807,TELKA.,"""It is Telka come!"" said she."
2808,TELKA.,So she fell and so she cried
2809,TELKA.,On that lonely mountain-side
2810,TELKA.,Where was Telka wont to bide.
2811,TELKA.,
2812,TELKA.,"""Who hath bribed those lips to lie?"
2813,TELKA.,"Telka's face was fair,"" quoth I;"
2814,TELKA.,"""Thine is furrowed with despair."
2815,TELKA.,There is winter in thy hair;
2816,TELKA.,But upon her beauteous head
2817,TELKA.,"Was there summer glory shed,--"
2818,TELKA.,"Such a glory as the sun,"
2819,TELKA.,"When his daily course is run,"
2820,TELKA.,Smiles upon this mountain height
2821,TELKA.,As he kisses it good-night.
2822,TELKA.,"There was music in her tone,"
2823,TELKA.,Misery in thy voice alone.
2824,TELKA.,They have bid thee lie to me.
2825,TELKA.,Let me pass! Thou art not she!
2826,TELKA.,Let my sorrow sacred be
2827,TELKA.,"Underneath this trysting tree!"""
2828,TELKA.,
2829,TELKA.,"So in wrath I went my way,"
2830,TELKA.,"And they came another day,--"
2831,TELKA.,"Came another day, and said:"
2832,TELKA.,"""Hush thy cry, for she is dead,"
2833,TELKA.,Yonder on the mountain-side
2834,TELKA.,"She is buried where she died,"
2835,TELKA.,"Where you twain were wont to bide,"
2836,TELKA.,Where she came and fell and cried
2837,TELKA.,Pardon that thy wrath denied;
2838,TELKA.,And above her bosom grows
2839,TELKA.,As in mockery the Rose:
2840,TELKA.,"It was white; but now 'tis red,"
2841,TELKA.,And in shame it bows its head
2842,TELKA.,"Over sinful Telka dead."""
2843,TELKA.,
2844,TELKA.,"So they thought to silence me,--"
2845,TELKA.,As if love could silenced be!
2846,TELKA.,"Fool were I, and fools were they!"
2847,TELKA.,"Scornfully I went my way,"
2848,TELKA.,And upon the mountain-side
2849,TELKA.,"""Telka!"" evermore I cried."
2850,TELKA.,"""Telka!"" evermore I cry;"
2851,TELKA.,Answer me the woods and sky:
2852,TELKA.,So the lonely years go by.
2853,TELKA.,
2854,TELKA.,"She is lost, and that is all;"
2855,TELKA.,"Sometime she shall hear my call,"
2856,TELKA.,"Hear my pleading call, and then"
2857,TELKA.,Find her way to me again.

3675,THE ONION TART.,Each has his favorite tart;
3676,THE ONION TART.,But those which most delight the rest
3677,THE ONION TART.,Methinks should suit me not:
3678,THE ONION TART.,"The onion tart doth please me best,--"
3679,THE ONION TART.,"Ach, Gott! mein lieber Gott!"
3680,THE ONION TART.,
3681,THE ONION TART.,Where but in Deutschland can be found
3682,THE ONION TART.,This boon of which I sing?
3683,THE ONION TART.,Who but a Teuton could compound
3684,THE ONION TART.,This _sui generis_ thing?
3685,THE ONION TART.,None with the German frau can vie
3686,THE ONION TART.,"In arts cuisine, I wot,"
3687,THE ONION TART.,"Whose _summum bonum_ breeds the sigh,"

3689,THE ONION TART.,
3690,THE ONION TART.,"You slice the fruit upon the dough,"
3691,THE ONION TART.,"And season to the taste,"
3692,THE ONION TART.,Then in an oven (not too slow)
3693,THE ONION TART.,The viand should be placed;
3694,THE ONION TART.,"And when 'tis done, upon a plate"
3695,THE ONION TART.,You serve it piping hot.
3696,THE ONION TART.,"Your nostrils and your eyes dilate,--"
3697,THE ONION TART.,"Ach, Gott! mein lieber Gott!"

3699,THE ONION TART.,It sweeps upon the sight and smell

3753,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"The Teuton belle, the ma'moiselle,--all give me keen delight;"
3754,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"And yet I'll say, go where I may, I never yet have seen"
3755,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,A dress that's quite as grand a sight as was that bombazine.
3756,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,
3757,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"Now, you must know 'twas years ago this quaint but noble gown"
3758,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"Flashed in one day, the usual way, upon our solemn town."
3759,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"'Twas Fisk who sold for sordid gold that gravely scrumptious thing,--"
3760,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"Jim Fisk, the man who drove a span that would have joyed a king,--"
3761,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"And grandma's eye fell with a sigh upon that sombre sheen,"

3763,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,
3764,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"Though ten years old, I never told the neighbors of the gown;"
3765,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"For grandma said, ""This secret, Ned, must not be breathed in town."""
3766,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,The sitting-room for days of gloom was in a dreadful mess
3767,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"When that quaint dame, Miss Kelsey, came to make the wondrous dress:"
3768,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"To fit and baste and stitch a waist, with whale-bones in between,"
3769,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"Is precious slow, as all folks know who've made a bombazine."
3770,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,
3771,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,With fortitude dear grandma stood the trial to the end
3772,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,(The nerve we find in womankind I cannot comprehend!);
3773,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"And when 'twas done resolved that none should guess at the surprise,"
3774,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"Within the press she hid that dress, secure from prying eyes;"
3775,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"For grandma knew a thing or two,--by which remark I mean"
3776,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,That Sundays were the days for her to wear that bombazine.
3777,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,
3778,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"I need not state she got there late; and, sailing up the aisle"
3779,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"With regal grace, on grandma's face reposed a conscious smile."
3780,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"It fitted so, above, below, and hung so well all round,"

3782,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"How proud I was of her, because she looked so like a queen!"
3783,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"And that was why, perhaps, that I admired the bombazine."
3784,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,
3785,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"But there _were_ those, as you'd suppose, who scorned that perfect"
3786,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,gown;

3788,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"The Widow White spat out her spite in one: ""It doesn't fit!"""

3793,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"But grandma knew, and I did, too, that gown was wondrous fine,--"
3794,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,The envious sneers and jaundiced jeers were a conclusive sign.
3795,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"Why, grandpa said it went ahead of all the girls in town,"
3796,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"And, saying this, he snatched a kiss that like to burst that gown;"
3797,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"But, blushing red, my grandma said, ""Oh, isn't grandpa mean!"""
3798,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,Yet evermore my grandma wore _his_ favorite bombazine.
3799,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,
3800,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"And when she died that sombre pride passed down to heedless heirs,--"
3801,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"Alas, the day 't was hung away beneath the kitchen stairs!"
3802,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"Thence in due time, with dust and grime, came foes on foot and wing,"
3803,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,And made their nests and sped their guests in that once beauteous
3804,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,thing.
3805,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"'Tis so, forsooth! Time's envious tooth corrodes each human scene;"
3806,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"And so, at last, to ruin passed my grandma's bombazine."
3807,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,
3808,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"Yet to this day, I'm proud to say, it plays a grateful part,--"
3809,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,The thoughts it brings are of such things as touch and warm my heart.
3810,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"This gown, my dear, you show me here I'll own is passing fair,"
3811,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,Though I'll confess it's no such dress as grandma used to wear.
3812,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,"Yet wear it, _do_; perchance when you and I are off the scene,"
3813,GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.,Our boy shall sing _this_ comely thing as _I_ the bombazine.

3829,RARE ROAST BEEF.,
3830,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"And even when the body's in the very prime of health,"

3838,RARE ROAST BEEF.,
3839,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"Some like the sirloin, but I think the porterhouse is best,--"
3840,RARE ROAST BEEF.,'Tis juicier and tenderer and meatier than the rest;

3842,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"Into the sizzling dripping-pan a cupful, and no more;"
3843,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"The oven being hot, the roast will cook in half an hour;"
3844,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"Then to the juices in the pan you add a little flour,"
3845,RARE ROAST BEEF.,And so you get a gravy that is called the cap sheaf
3846,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"Of that glorious _summum bonum_, rare roast beef."
3847,RARE ROAST BEEF.,
3848,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"Served on a platter that is hot, and carved with thin, keen knife,"
3849,RARE ROAST BEEF.,How does this savory viand enhance the worth of life!
3850,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"Give me no thin and shadowy slice, but a thick and steaming slab,--"
3851,RARE ROAST BEEF.,Who would not choose a generous hunk to a bloodless little dab?
3852,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"Upon a nice hot plate how does the juicy morceau steam,"
3853,RARE ROAST BEEF.,A symphony in scarlet or a red incarnate dream!
3854,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"Take from me eyes and ears and all, O Time, thou ruthless thief!"
3855,RARE ROAST BEEF.,Except these teeth wherewith to deal with rare roast beef.
3856,RARE ROAST BEEF.,
3857,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"Most every kind and rôle of modern victuals have I tried,"
3858,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"Including roasted, fricasseed, broiled, toasted, stewed, and fried,"
3859,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"Your canvasbacks and papa-bottes and muttonchops subese,"
3860,RARE ROAST BEEF.,Your patties _à la_ Turkey and your doughnuts _à la_ grease;
3861,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"I've whirled away dyspeptic hours with crabs in marble halls,"
3862,RARE ROAST BEEF.,And in the lowly cottage I've experienced codfish balls;
3863,RARE ROAST BEEF.,But I've never found a viand that could so allay all grief
3864,RARE ROAST BEEF.,And soothe the cockles of the heart as rare roast beef.
3865,RARE ROAST BEEF.,
3866,RARE ROAST BEEF.,"I honor that sagacious king who, in a grateful mood,"
3867,RARE ROAST BEEF.,Knighted the savory loin that on the royal table stood;

3981,OUR WHIPPINGS.,"Egad! and were we so disposed, I'll venture we could show"

3983,OUR WHIPPINGS.,"What wallopings I mean I think I need not specify,--"
3984,OUR WHIPPINGS.,"Mother's whippings didn't hurt; but father's,--oh, my!"
3985,OUR WHIPPINGS.,
3986,OUR WHIPPINGS.,"The way that we played hookey those many years ago,"

3997,OUR WHIPPINGS.,"How mother used to wonder why our clothes were full of sand,--"
3998,OUR WHIPPINGS.,"But father, having been a boy, appeared to understand;"
3999,OUR WHIPPINGS.,"And after tea he'd beckon us to join him in the shed,"

4002,OUR WHIPPINGS.,The proposition that our father's lickings always hurt!
4003,OUR WHIPPINGS.,
4004,OUR WHIPPINGS.,For mother was by nature so forgiving and so mild
4005,OUR WHIPPINGS.,That she inclined to spare the rod although she spoiled the child;
4006,OUR WHIPPINGS.,"And when at last in self-defence she had to whip us, she"
