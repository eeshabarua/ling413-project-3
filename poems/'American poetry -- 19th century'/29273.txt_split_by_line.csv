921,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"not know how to doctor hens, they doctor them wrong, it hurts them, and"
922,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,it is dreadful cruel to let them die. It is as distressing to dumb
923,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"creatures to undergo sickness, and death, as it is for human, and as"
924,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"distressing to be crueled, and as distressing to suffer. God requires"
925,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"human to take good care of dumb creatures, and be kind to them, or not"
926,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"keep any. Now do understand, and I will tell you exact."
927,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,
928,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"STOPPAGE IN STOMACH.--If a hen has stoppage in her stomach, her corn"
929,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"stops in her crop, hard and swell large, and she sick, first work with"
930,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"your fingers carefully, get it soft, then take a small teaspoon and"
931,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"measure it full of epsom salts, and dissolve it in water, and give it to"
932,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"her with a teaspoon; you must keep to work with your fingers often, to"
933,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"keep it from hardening again, and the next day, if her breath smells"
934,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"bad, there is a rottenness in her stomach, then give her most as much of"
935,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,epsom salts again. Put a little flour porridge in her mouth with a
936,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"teaspoon, three times a day, and a little soaked cracker, soaked in"
937,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"water; put a little in her mouth if she can swallow it, in five days she"
938,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,eat with the hens and be well. This is the way I cure them. Folks bring
939,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"hens to me in this disease, to the point of death, been sick a long"
940,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"time, I cure them in five days; they must not have any milk in this"
941,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"disease, it will kill them, do as I tell you and you can cure them. Once"
942,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,in a great while one of my hens have stoppage in their stomach; I cure
943,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"them with only my fingers, because I take her as soon as the corn stops."
944,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"Milk does not agree with hens in sickness nor health, it keeps up in"
945,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"their stomach, and they vomit it up. I think strange it does not agree"
946,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"with hens, because milk is so good for human. You must not give your"
947,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"hens any castor oil, nor rhubarb, in not any disease whatever; it is"
948,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"poison for them, my reason tells me so, and I hear of folks killing"
949,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"their hens by giving them such stuff. My hens all keep healthy, because"
950,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"I keep them clean, and keep victuals and clean water standing by them,"
951,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"and take good care of them. I can cure a good many diseases for hens,"
952,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,but I cannot cure every disease. Every once in a while a sick hen is
953,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"brought to me, to the point of death, been sick a great while, most"
954,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"dead, some ail one disease, some ail a number of diseases; I receive"
955,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"them into my care, I doctor them, and take care of them, I raise them up"
956,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"to health, I am unable to do anything, but I must take pity."
957,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,
958,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"FROTH IN THROAT.--If a hen has froth in her throat and crop, measure a"
959,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"small teaspoonful of epsom salts, dissolve it, put in a little black"
960,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"pepper, and give it to her with a teaspoon, it will cure this disease;"
961,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"but if she make a screaming noise with it, and distressed with it, then"
962,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"a sore growing in her, then no cure."
963,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,
964,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"GAPES.--If a hen or chicken gapes a great deal, and sick, and complains"

966,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,pill in her mouth and make her swallow it till she takes down enough;
967,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,the black pepper kills the worms. I cure them so.

969,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"BAG STONE.--This is a seldom case, I have known this case once in a"
970,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"while. If a hen has a bag of stones grow in her, hang down under her,"
971,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"you must give her the best of good cake to eat, the stones will consume"
972,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"in a few weeks, then she will eat corn and oats with the hens, and lay"
973,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,you eggs; but if you do not give her the best of cake she will certainly
974,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"die, she cannot eat anything else then, in this disease, but best of"
975,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,cake. I cured them so.
976,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,
977,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"SKIN IN HEN.--If a hen goes on her nest, and try to lay an egg, and"
978,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"cannot, and there most all day, then a skin of an egg is in her, she"
979,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,will certainly die if the skin of egg is not took out of her; some one
980,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"has a small finger, and common sense, take the skin of egg out of her,"
981,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,then she is all right. I cure them so.

983,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"BONES.--If a hen is wounded in her hips, or any of her bones, bathe"
984,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"freely with McQuesten's Extractor a number of times every day, put on a"
985,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"good deal, till she gets well; I have cured a number of hens with this"
986,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"Extractor, they could not stand nor walk, their bones was so spraint,"
987,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"and so wrenched, &c. If their bones stiff too, then put on Dr. Job"
988,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"Sweet's Sprain Liniment, if any sore, then put on castile soap. I cure"

991,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"WILD.--I bought a young hen last year, she was dreadful wild, and when"

993,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"still, and eat out of my hand, she remains gentle ever since, and a good"

996,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"GREEN.--If a hen has bright green come from her, look same as bright"

998,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"in it, and Jamaica ginger, a number of times a day, till it cures this"

1005,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"down on the ground, only one yard off my feet, and some of them half a"
1006,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,yard off my feet. I give them oats and dough to eat; they eat it. Will

1008,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,
1009,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"DIARRHOEA.---If a hen has diarrhoea, and pain with it, you must be as"
1010,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"careful about what she eats, as her medicines; she must not have not any"
1011,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"corn, and not any corn meal dough, not till she is well. Give her a"

1013,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"medicine, Jamaica ginger, put in warm rice water, and grate in good deal"

1017,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"LICE.--Human, some of them, have lice on their hens, it is cruel, the"
1018,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"reason is, the hen-house above the ground, and keep dirty, that breeds"
1019,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"lice on hens, and breeds diseases too; have a cellar for your hens, and"
1020,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"take up the dressing every morning, be no lice, lice will not breed in a"

1027,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,
1028,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"COWS.--Meal is good for cows, but it will not do for her to have it dry,"
1029,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"it gets in her nose and lungs, and hurt her, wet it; the best way is to"
1030,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"scald it, and cool it, does more good. Cracked corn is better; boil it,"
1031,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"put on cover, it steams it soft very soon, one quart makes two and a"
1032,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"half. Cows must not have dusty hay, it hurts their lungs, &c. Cows ought"

1034,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,
1035,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"WARPED NECK.--If a hen has warped neck, rub on castor oil, faithful, a"

1060,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,looking down upon such folks; He will cast them off to everlasting
1061,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"punishment. Human must do God's commandments in deeds, words and"

1063,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,with hunger nor cold; cruelty not in any way; must not affrighten them;
1064,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,doctor them when they have diseases. Be good and kind to them. Think how
1065,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,good God is. Act up to His will in all your ways and all your thoughts
1066,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"too. You must keep your hens from suffering with cold, and give them"
1067,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"enough to eat, and keep them clean, and not affrighten them, &c., &c.,"
1068,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,or they cannot lay you eggs. If your hens or chickens have their crops
1069,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"swelled soft, and a fever, give them a portion of Epsom salts, with a"
1070,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"little black pepper in it, and give them as much warm water as they can"
1071,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"drink; in their sickness take good care of them, they get well. If they"
1072,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"have stoppage in their stomach, their crop swelled hard, take your"
1073,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"fingers and jam carefully till their crop is soft, then give them a"
1074,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"portion of Epsom salts. I have cured them with only my fingers, they get"
1075,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"well. If they have itching feet and scurfy, if mutton tallow will not"
1076,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"cure it, then put their feet in a thing of warm water and wash them"
1077,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"every morning till they get well. When they shed their feathers, their"
1078,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"stomach is weak then, they must have soft victuals then, hard corn will"
1079,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"distress their stomach then. If hen's body comes out, put it back in her"
1080,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"and see to her, she be well by the next day. If it comes more than half"
1081,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"way out, it can be put back if any one has common sense. If a string of"
1082,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"hen's insides comes out, with a egg fast to it, break the egg, and take"
1083,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"it off from her insides and put her insides back in her and see to her,"
1084,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,she be well by the next day. If hen's legs chilled with cold for want of
1085,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"sun, and they cannot walk, take them by the fire and rub their legs and"
1086,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"feet, faithful, half a day, then rub on black pepper mixed with warm"
1087,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"water, they get well. If a hen is starved she must not have hard corn at"
1088,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"first, give her flour bread soaked soft in milk, till she is able to eat"
1089,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"corn. Hens must not go in snow, it hurts them. They must not have fat"
1090,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"meat. They must not be crowded, their room must be large enough. Their"
1091,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"roosts must not be too high, for them to fly down on hard floor, it"
1092,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,hurts their feet and hips. I know it. Hens want sun in winter and shade
1093,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"in summer. If hens' feet crack, bleed, and sore places, melt mutton"
1094,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"tallow and white sugar together, rub it on faithful, they get well. If"
1095,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"they bleed great deal, put on warm alum water first, they get well. If"
1096,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"hens' feet swell, put on sweet apple balsam every day, they get well. If"
1097,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"hens' head turns over, give her Epsom salts and black pepper, she get"
1098,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"over it for a while. If hens have diarrhoea, give them boiled rice,"
1099,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"black pepper, nutmeg, mixed, they get well if you take good care of"
1100,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"them. Hens must not have fish, it physics them. Hens must not have"
1101,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,anything relaxing. If hens have rattling in their throat give them Epsom
1102,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"salts and black pepper, they get well. If hen has her head quiver, and"
1103,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"stagger, give her Epsom salts, and keep her quiet, and her food soak"
1104,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"cracker in milk, she get well. If hens taken lame in the afternoon"
1105,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"without being hurt, rub on mutton tallow and black pepper, they get"
1106,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"well. If hen's bones spraint or bruised, bathe freely with Mequesten's"
1107,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"Extracter, take good care of her, she get well in time, must have little"
1108,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"time for it. This medicine will cure burns, scalds, on human, no doubt"
1109,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"on hens too. It will cure sores, put it on when they first begin to"
1110,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"come. If anything ails hens' eyes, rain-water is good, new milk put on,"
1111,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"mutton tallow put around her eyes, salve made of rose water and cream,"
1112,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"put around her eyes. Hens must not be confined in wind, it hurts them,"
1113,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,they cannot lay you eggs. God placed us in this world to be kind to dumb
1114,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"creatures, or not keep any, and kind to human too. Consider what a"
1115,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"wickedness it is to go contrary from it. I keep cow and hens, I do my"
1116,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"duty for them. If hens have watery stomachs give them black pepper, put"
1117,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"it in their dough, if they are able to eat it, if not able, then mix the"
1118,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"pepper with water, and give it to her with a teaspoon, be careful and"
1119,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"not have it too strong, to take her breath. If hens have pip, give them"
1120,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"the same medicine, it will cure pip and watery stomach. Help them in"
1121,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"season. If hen has swelled throat, put on sweet oil and black pepper,"
1122,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"she get well. You must not give your hens salt, it will kill them. You"
1123,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"must not give them rye, it will hurt them. If hen lays soft shell eggs,"
1124,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"let her set two or three weeks, she lay hard shell eggs again. You must"
1125,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,take good care of your poor hens or they cannot lay you eggs. Hens must
1126,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"be kept clean and must not have any bad smell with them, it will poison"
1127,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"them. You must not give them cayenne pepper, it will poison them, it"
1128,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"drives a redness into their heads, then they fail till they die. Black"
1129,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,pepper is good for them when they need it. Hens must have clean victuals
1130,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,and clean water to drink. Take the chill off the water in winter. Keep
1131,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"good yellow southern corn standing by them, they take a little when they"
1132,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"want it, it does them more good, and it takes less to keep them. Give"
1133,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"them boiled oats, it is good for them to lay eggs. I give my hens boiled"
1134,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"oats all the time, and corn standing by them. I give them some other"
1135,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"victuals too, sometimes, and sometimes I give them some boiled potatoes."
1136,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,I mash it with cream for them. My hens lay me more eggs than anybody's
1137,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"hens anywhere, by what I hear. Good flour bread is splendid to make them"
1138,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"lay eggs, but I am not able to cook it for them. The bread must not be"
1139,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"sour. Keep fine clam shells by them, and gravel sand. They must be kept"
1140,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"warm in winter and cool in summer. They must have clean, warm cellar"
1141,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"room, you will have double the eggs. Take up the dressing every morning"
1142,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"certain, and oftener, if they stay down there days. When cold, keep them"
1143,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"in the cellar, when the weather is suitable, let them out days. If cold"
1144,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"morning, keep them in till the sun gets up warm. Be clever to them. They"
1145,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,must not be affrighted. They can never get over it. I hear what folks do
1146,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"all my days, and their poor hens cannot lay much and they die off. It is"
1147,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,wicked for folks to be so cruel.
1148,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,
1149,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"Be good and kind to all that breathes,"
1150,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"Act up our good Saviour's laws,"

1153,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,
1154,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"My hens are all in better order since I had a cellar for them, than they"
1155,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"were before, and lay me double the eggs. Hens must not suffer with the"
1156,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"cold, nor no other sufferings, you cannot have eggs. Raise your chickens"
1157,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"on good flour bread, it will make them healthy, grow fast and smart;"
1158,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,they must be fed often; I do not think meal is very good for hens or
1159,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,chickens; meal is splendid for cows. If you are forced to give your hens
1160,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"or chickens meal, you must sift it fine and scald it and cool it. I used"
1161,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"to raise my chickens on flour middlings dough, it is splendid for them."
1162,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,Flour bread is better. I do not set any hens now. You must not let young
1163,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"chickens go in cold nor wet ground, nor rain, &c., &c. You must boil"
1164,HENS--THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.,"some corn in winter, and give it to your hens warm, besides other"
