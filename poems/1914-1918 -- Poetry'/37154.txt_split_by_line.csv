191,THE KAISER'S FAVORITE POEMS,The color of his fancy
192,THE KAISER'S FAVORITE POEMS,And the prompter of his deeds:

301,IN THE TRENCHES,And filled the hours with gloom;
302,IN THE TRENCHES,The fateful music smote the sky
303,IN THE TRENCHES,In tremulous bars of doom;
304,IN THE TRENCHES,But as the evening stars came forth

306,IN THE TRENCHES,There rose from hearts of patriot love
307,IN THE TRENCHES,A tender song of life.
308,IN THE TRENCHES,
309,IN THE TRENCHES,A song of home and fireside
310,IN THE TRENCHES,"Swelled on the evening air,"
311,IN THE TRENCHES,"And men forgot their battle line,"
312,IN THE TRENCHES,Its carnage and dark care;

315,IN THE TRENCHES,As high above the tide of war
316,IN THE TRENCHES,It swept and pulsed along.
317,IN THE TRENCHES,
318,IN THE TRENCHES,That night while sleeping where the stars
