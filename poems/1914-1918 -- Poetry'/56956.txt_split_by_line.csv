60,PREFACE,PREFACE
61,PREFACE,
62,PREFACE,
63,PREFACE,"On a fateful day in 1914, without a warning flash or tremor, there fell"
64,PREFACE,upon the world such a blast of war as human reason could not have
65,PREFACE,"foreglimpsed, nor Apocalyptic vision raised, to appall the souls of men."
66,PREFACE,Twenty-seven nations took the shock and were rocked to their
67,PREFACE,foundations. Eleven were caught and knotted in the maddest agony of
68,PREFACE,conflict that ever was known. Through four years the winds of
69,PREFACE,"destruction swirled and roared around the monstrous welter, before the"
70,PREFACE,evil forces failed and their exhaustion brought a breathing space such
71,PREFACE,as lies at the heart of a typhoon. Around the widening edges of that
72,PREFACE,"space they still muttered for a while in gusts of blood and fire, slowly"
73,PREFACE,"receding, slowly dying. But the great storm is gone; the long night that"
74,PREFACE,seemed the night of doom is over.
75,PREFACE,
76,PREFACE,"Its epic has not been written. The time is too near us, the motive too"
77,PREFACE,"deep, the theme too vast. But out of the dark came many voices, voices"
78,PREFACE,"of lamentation, of home and love and hope and heroism and loftiest"
79,PREFACE,"ideality, of romance, of strange comedy. These had their inspiration"
80,PREFACE,"from a gigantic spectacle of elemental passions in cross-play, from the"
81,PREFACE,"thoughts and emotions not of a single people, but of all that were"
82,PREFACE,fighting for the life and light of civilization. Poets great and poets
83,PREFACE,"minor followed the war or fought in it, and expressed its spirit with a"
84,PREFACE,"personal, passionate fidelity impossible to historians."
85,PREFACE,
86,PREFACE,It would not be well were all these voices lost. Many are worth fixation
87,PREFACE,"where they may be heard again at will, and that is the reason for and"
88,PREFACE,purpose of this book. The finest and truest of them are given here.
89,PREFACE,
90,PREFACE,"In making selection, availability for recitation has been considered."
91,PREFACE,There is no better way to stir the mind or fix the memory than by spoken
92,PREFACE,"words of beauty in rhythmic cadence, especially in schools. It is hoped"
93,PREFACE,they will be effective in such uses.
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,Readers will find in the captain notes many helpful sidelights upon
96,PREFACE,topics and personalities. These will commend themselves for their own
97,PREFACE,sake.

643,IN THE SPECTATOR,Never a house and never a hedge
644,IN THE SPECTATOR,"In No Man’s Land from edge to edge,"

658,IN THE SPECTATOR,
659,IN THE SPECTATOR,But No Man’s Land is a goblin sight
660,IN THE SPECTATOR,When patrols crawl over at dead o’ night;
661,IN THE SPECTATOR,"Boche or British, Belgian or French,"
662,IN THE SPECTATOR,You dice with death when you cross the trench.
663,IN THE SPECTATOR,"When the “rapid,” like fire-flies in the dark,"
664,IN THE SPECTATOR,"Flits down the parapet spark by spark,"
665,IN THE SPECTATOR,And you drop for cover to keep your head

668,IN THE SPECTATOR,The man who ranges in No Man’s Land

672,IN THE SPECTATOR,And the bursting bomb or the bayonet-snatch
673,IN THE SPECTATOR,May answer the click of your safety-catch.

745,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,
746,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,
747,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,I have a conversation book; I brought it out from home.
748,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,It tells you the French for knife and fork and likewise brush and comb;
749,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"It learns you how to ask the time, the names of all the stars,"
750,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,And how to order oysters and how to buy cigars.
751,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,
752,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"But there ain’t no stores to buy in; there ain’t no big hotels,"
753,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,When you spend your time in dugouts doing a wholesale trade in shells;
754,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"It’s nice to know the proper talk for theatres and such,"
755,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"But when it comes to talking, why, it doesn’t help you much."
756,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,There’s all them friendly kind o’ things you’d naturally say
757,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,When you meet a feller casual like and pass the time o’ day.
758,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,Them little things that breaks the ice and kind of clears the air.
759,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"But when you use your French book, why, them things isn’t there."
760,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,
761,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,I met a chap the other day a-rootin’ in a trench.
762,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"He didn’t know a word of ours, nor me a word of French;"
763,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"And how we ever managed, well, I cannot understand,"
764,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,But I never used my French book though I had it in my hand.
765,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,I winked at him to start with; he grinned from ear to ear;
766,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"An’ he says, “Bong jour, Sammy,” an’ I says “Souvenir”;"
767,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"He took my only cigarette, I took his thin cigar,"
768,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"Which set the ball a-rollin’, and so--well, there you are!"
769,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"I showed him next my wife and kids; he up and showed me his,"
770,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,Them funny little French kids with hair all in a frizz;
771,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"“Annette,” he says, “Louise,” he says, and his tears begin to fall;"
772,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"We was comrades when we parted, though we’d hardly spoke at all."
773,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,
774,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"He’d have kissed me if I’d let him. We had never met before,"
775,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"And I’ve never seen the beggar since, for that’s the way of war;"
776,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,"And though we scarcely spoke a word, I wonder just the same"
777,IN THE SAN FRANCISCO ARGONAUT,If he’ll ever see them kids of his--I never asked his name.

1060,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),and New Zealand. These indomitables came half way round the globe
1061,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),"at Britain’s first call. Their first appearance was in Egypt, where"
1062,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),they drove the German-led Turks back into the desert and saved the
1063,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),Suez canal. They were and are officially designated the “Australian

1066,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),made by running together the first letters of their official title.
1067,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),Australia’s own name for her soldier is Bill-Jim. “The Graves of

1078,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),"None tends them. Flowers will come again in spring,"

1098,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),And we will mourn them proudly as of right--

1108,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),"This be their epitaph. “Traveler, south or west,"
1109,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),"Go, say at home we heard the trumpet call,"
1110,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),And answered. Now beside the sea we rest.
1111,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),Our end was happy if our country thrives:
1112,L. L. (A. N. Z. A. C.),Much was demanded. Lo! our store was small--

1148,EDGAR A. GUEST,"On through fields that death was sweeping with a murderous fire,"
1149,EDGAR A. GUEST,they went
1150,EDGAR A. GUEST,Till the Teuton line was vanquished and the German strength was spent.
1151,EDGAR A. GUEST,
1152,EDGAR A. GUEST,Ebbed and flowed the tides of battle as they’ve seldom done before;

1155,EDGAR A. GUEST,The living line of courage kept the faith and moved ahead.

1300,IN PUNCH,"It was the high midsummer, and the sun was shining strong,"
1301,IN PUNCH,"And the lane was rather flinty, and the lane was rather long,"
1302,IN PUNCH,When--up and down the gentle hills beside the stripling Test--
1303,IN PUNCH,I chanced to come to Bullington and stayed a while to rest.
1304,IN PUNCH,
1305,IN PUNCH,"It was drowned in peace and quiet, as the river reeds are drowned"
1306,IN PUNCH,"In the water clear as crystal, flowing by with scarce a sound,"
1307,IN PUNCH,"And the air was like a posy with the sweet haymaking smells,"

1309,IN PUNCH,
1310,IN PUNCH,"Far away as some strange planet seemed the old world’s dust and din,"
1311,IN PUNCH,And the trout in sun-warmed shallows hardly seemed to stir a fin;
1312,IN PUNCH,And there’s never a clock to tell you how the hurrying world goes on
1313,IN PUNCH,In the little ivied steeple down in drowsy Bullington.
1314,IN PUNCH,
1315,IN PUNCH,"Small and sleepy, there it nestled, seeming far from hastening Time,"
1316,IN PUNCH,As a teeny-tiny village in some quaint old nursery rhyme;
1317,IN PUNCH,And a teeny-tiny river by a teeny-tiny weir
1318,IN PUNCH,Sang a teeny-tiny ditty that I stayed a while to hear.
1319,IN PUNCH,
1320,IN PUNCH,"“Oh, the stream runs to the river, and the river to the sea,"
1321,IN PUNCH,But the reedy banks of Bullington are good enough for me;
1322,IN PUNCH,"Oh, the lane runs to the highway, and the highway o’er the down,"
1323,IN PUNCH,But it’s better here in Bullington than there in London town.”
1324,IN PUNCH,
1325,IN PUNCH,"Then high above an aeroplane in humming flight went by,"
1326,IN PUNCH,"With the droning of its engines filling all the cloudless sky,"
1327,IN PUNCH,And like the booming of a knell across that perfect day
1328,IN PUNCH,There came the gun’s dull thunder from the ranges far away.
1329,IN PUNCH,
1330,IN PUNCH,"And while I lay and listened, oh, the river’s sleepy tune"
1331,IN PUNCH,"Seemed to change its rippling music, like the cuckoo’s stave in June;"
1332,IN PUNCH,"And the cannon’s distant thunder, and the engines’ warlike drone"
1333,IN PUNCH,Seemed to mingle with its burthen in a solemn undertone.
1334,IN PUNCH,
1335,IN PUNCH,"“Oh, the stream runs to the river, and the river to the sea,"
1336,IN PUNCH,"And there’s war on land and water, and there’s work for you and me!"
1337,IN PUNCH,And on many a field of glory there are gallant lives laid down
1338,IN PUNCH,As well for tiny Bullington as mighty London town!”
1339,IN PUNCH,
1340,IN PUNCH,"So I roused me from my daydream, for I knew the song spoke true"
1341,IN PUNCH,That it isn’t time for dreaming while there’s duty still to do;
1342,IN PUNCH,"And I turned into the highway where it meets the flinty lane,"
1343,IN PUNCH,And the world of wars and sorrows was about me once again.

1446,BERTON BRALEY,“Shavetail” is a name applied by enlisted men in the regular army
1447,BERTON BRALEY,to lieutenants fresh from West Point.
1448,BERTON BRALEY,
1449,BERTON BRALEY,
1450,BERTON BRALEY,"Twenty years of the army, of drawing a sergeant’s pay"
1451,BERTON BRALEY,"And helping the West Point shavetails, fresh from the training school,"
1452,BERTON BRALEY,To handle a bunch of soldiers and drill ’em the proper way
1453,BERTON BRALEY,(Which isn’t always exactly according to book and rule).
1454,BERTON BRALEY,"I’ve seen ’em rise to Captains and Majors and Colonels, too,"
1455,BERTON BRALEY,"And me still only a sergeant, the same as I used to be,"
1456,BERTON BRALEY,"And I knew that some of them didn’t know as much as a sergeant knew,"
1457,BERTON BRALEY,But I stuck to my daily duty--there wasn’t a growl from me.
1458,BERTON BRALEY,
1459,BERTON BRALEY,"Twenty years of the army,"
1460,BERTON BRALEY,"Serving in peace and war,"
1461,BERTON BRALEY,"Standing the drill of the army mill,"
1462,BERTON BRALEY,For that’s what they paid me for.
1463,BERTON BRALEY,
1464,BERTON BRALEY,"Twenty years with the army, which wasn’t so much for size,"
1465,BERTON BRALEY,But man for man I’d back it to lick any troops on earth.
1466,BERTON BRALEY,"’Twas a proud little classy army, as good as the flag it flies,"
1467,BERTON BRALEY,And it takes an old top sergeant to know what the flag is worth.
1468,BERTON BRALEY,"Then--a shot at Sarejevo, and hell burst over there"
1469,BERTON BRALEY,"And the kaiser dragged us in it, and the bill for the draft was passed"
1470,BERTON BRALEY,"And--they handed me my commission, and some shoulder straps to wear,"
1471,BERTON BRALEY,And the crazy dream of my rooky days had changed to a fact at last.
1472,BERTON BRALEY,
1473,BERTON BRALEY,"Twenty years with the army,"
1474,BERTON BRALEY,And it’s great to know they call
1475,BERTON BRALEY,On the guys like me for what will be
1476,BERTON BRALEY,The mightiest job of all.
1477,BERTON BRALEY,
1478,BERTON BRALEY,"Twenty years of the army, of doing what shavetails bid,"
1479,BERTON BRALEY,"And I know I haven’t the polish that fellows like that will show,"
1480,BERTON BRALEY,"And I hold a high opinion of the brains of a West Point kid,"
1481,BERTON BRALEY,But I think I can make him hustle when it comes to the work I know.
1482,BERTON BRALEY,"But who cares where we come from, Plattsburg, ranks, or the Guard,"
1483,BERTON BRALEY,"This isn’t a pink tea-party, but a War to be fought and won;"
1484,BERTON BRALEY,"There’s a serious job before us, a job that is huge and hard,"
1485,BERTON BRALEY,And the social register don’t count until we’ve got it done!
1486,BERTON BRALEY,
1487,BERTON BRALEY,"Twenty years in the army,"
1488,BERTON BRALEY,And now I’ve got my chance.
1489,BERTON BRALEY,"Have I earned my straps? Well, you watch the chaps"

2111,IN THE SPECTATOR,"We had forgotten You, or very nearly--"
2112,IN THE SPECTATOR,You did not seem to touch us very nearly--
2113,IN THE SPECTATOR,Of course we thought about You now and then;
2114,IN THE SPECTATOR,Especially in any time of trouble--
2115,IN THE SPECTATOR,We knew that You were good in time of trouble--
2116,IN THE SPECTATOR,But we are very ordinary men.
2117,IN THE SPECTATOR,
2118,IN THE SPECTATOR,And there were always other things to think of--
2119,IN THE SPECTATOR,There’s lots of things a man has got to think of--
2120,IN THE SPECTATOR,"His work, his home, his pleasure, and his wife;"
2121,IN THE SPECTATOR,And so we only thought of You on Sunday--
2122,IN THE SPECTATOR,"Sometimes, perhaps, not even on a Sunday--"
2123,IN THE SPECTATOR,Because there’s always lots to fill one’s life.
2124,IN THE SPECTATOR,
2125,IN THE SPECTATOR,"And, all the while, in the street or lane or byway--"
2126,IN THE SPECTATOR,"In country lane, in city street, or byway--"
2127,IN THE SPECTATOR,"You walked among us, and we did not see."
2128,IN THE SPECTATOR,Your feet were bleeding as You walked our pavements--
2129,IN THE SPECTATOR,How _did_ we miss Your Footprints on our pavements?--
2130,IN THE SPECTATOR,Can there be other folk as blind as we?
2131,IN THE SPECTATOR,
2132,IN THE SPECTATOR,_Now_ we remember; over here in Flanders--
2133,IN THE SPECTATOR,(It isn’t strange to think of You in Flanders)--
2134,IN THE SPECTATOR,This hideous warfare seems to make things clear.
2135,IN THE SPECTATOR,We never thought about You much in England--
2136,IN THE SPECTATOR,But now that we are far away from England--
2137,IN THE SPECTATOR,"We have no doubts, we know that You are here."
2138,IN THE SPECTATOR,
2139,IN THE SPECTATOR,You helped us pass the jest along the trenches--
2140,IN THE SPECTATOR,"Where, in cold blood, we waited in the trenches--"
2141,IN THE SPECTATOR,You touched its ribaldry and made it fine.
2142,IN THE SPECTATOR,You stood beside us in our pain and weakness--
2143,IN THE SPECTATOR,We’re glad to think You understand our weakness--
2144,IN THE SPECTATOR,Somehow it seems to help us not to whine.
2145,IN THE SPECTATOR,
2146,IN THE SPECTATOR,We think about You kneeling in the Garden--
2147,IN THE SPECTATOR,Ah! God! the agony of that dread Garden--
2148,IN THE SPECTATOR,We know You prayed for us upon the Cross.
2149,IN THE SPECTATOR,If anything could make us glad to bear it--
2150,IN THE SPECTATOR,’Twould be the knowledge that You willed to bear it--
2151,IN THE SPECTATOR,Pain--death--the uttermost of human loss.
2152,IN THE SPECTATOR,
2153,IN THE SPECTATOR,Though we forgot You--You will not forget us--
2154,IN THE SPECTATOR,We feel so sure that You will not forget us--
2155,IN THE SPECTATOR,But stay with us until this dream is past.
2156,IN THE SPECTATOR,"And so we ask for courage, strength, and pardon--"
2157,IN THE SPECTATOR,"Especially, I think, we ask for pardon--"
2158,IN THE SPECTATOR,And that You’ll stand beside us to the last.

2213,EDGAR A. GUEST,We were up to our dead line an’ fighting alone;
2214,EDGAR A. GUEST,"Some plan had miscarried, I guess,"

2221,EDGAR A. GUEST,The few of us left had to stick.
2222,EDGAR A. GUEST,You haven’t much chance to get central an’ talk
2223,EDGAR A. GUEST,On the ’phone to the music of guns;
2224,EDGAR A. GUEST,Gettin’ word to the chief is a matter right then

2238,EDGAR A. GUEST,An’ for us to hang onto the ditch that we held;
2239,EDGAR A. GUEST,The reserves would relieve us at night.
2240,EDGAR A. GUEST,Then we stuck to our trench an’ we stuck to our guns;
2241,EDGAR A. GUEST,You know how you’ll fight when you know

2346,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,He wasn’t much to look at--
2347,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,"In fact, was rather rough;"
2348,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,He served his time as rookie--
2349,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,"At drilling in the sun,"
2350,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,And cleared a lot of timber
2351,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,And polished up his gun.
2352,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,
2353,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,Mike Dillon was a private
2354,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,With all the word entails;
2355,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,He cussed and chewed tobacco
2356,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,And overlooked his nails.
2357,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,You never saw Mike Dillon
2358,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,At dances ultra nice;
2359,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,"In fact, inspection found him"
2360,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,Enjoying body lice.
2361,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,
2362,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,If Mike had married money
2363,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,"Or had a little drag,"
2364,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,He might have got a brevet
2365,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,And missed a little “fag”;
2366,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,But as a social figure
2367,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,He simply wasn’t there--
2368,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,So Mike continued drilling
2369,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,And knifing up his fare.
2370,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,
2371,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,In course of time they shipped ’em
2372,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,And shipped ’em over where
2373,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,A man like Mike can sidestep
2374,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,"The frigid social stare,"
2375,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,And do the job of soldier
2376,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,"Without the fancy frills,"
2377,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,And keep a steady footing
2378,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,In the pace that really kills.
2379,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,
2380,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,Now Mike did nothing special;
2381,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,He only did his best:
2382,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,He stuck and “went on over”--
2383,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,And got it in the chest;
2384,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,He played it fair and squarely
2385,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,"Without a social air,"
2386,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,And Mike is now in heaven
2387,LIEUT. JOHN PIERRE ROCHE,And at least a corporal there!

3166,OF THE VIGILANTES,Were hidden thereabout. Fifty yards on
3167,OF THE VIGILANTES,"We ran into an ambush. Well, of course"

3181,OF THE VIGILANTES,The eyelids of my soul and I must bear
3182,OF THE VIGILANTES,The perfect understanding of the dead.
3183,OF THE VIGILANTES,"Now that I know myself as I am known,"

3336,TO MY SON,Flash blue your eyes! Hold high your proud young head!

3340,TO MY SON,I would not it were otherwise. And yet
3341,TO MY SON,"’Tis hard to speed your marching forth, my son!"
3342,TO MY SON,’Tis doubly hard to live without regret

3345,TO MY SON,But would the chance were mine with you to stand

3408,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,He didn’t mean that it should go
3409,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,Beyond a hundred miles or so;
3410,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,"He wanted something made for show,"

3414,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,"Or not enough to guard the stormy green,"

3416,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,“I’ll take your six-feet-over-all

3420,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,“A cruising-fighter? Never!” (The experts chorused that.)
3421,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,“She’ll sink before she’s half-way out to France”;
3422,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,"But Sam cut out her bathtubs white,"
3423,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,He painted her a perfect fright
3424,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,And loaded her with dynamite;
3425,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,Says he: “I’ll take a chance.”
3426,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,
3427,REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN,"“Good-night!” said Wall of Wall St.; the experts said it, too;"

3560,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,I was an exile from my own country and wandered over the breast of the
3561,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,world seeking another country.
3562,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3563,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,And I came into a land where there was only a long spring and a long
3564,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"autumn, where they did not know the deadly heats of our summers or the"
3565,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,mortal colds of our mountains. Among the vines and sunny fields I saw
3566,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"the people of this land at work, ever young of soul, smiling, loving,"
3567,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,and kindly.
3568,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3569,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"I asked, “What is the name of this happy place?”"
3570,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3571,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"And the answer was, “France the voluptuous.”"
3572,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3573,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"I came to towns of splendid monuments, of harmonious buildings, of proud"
3574,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"triumphal arches of the past, and above always I saw the spires of great"
3575,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"cathedrals stretching toward the sky, as if to seize upon the feet of"
3576,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,God.
3577,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3578,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"I asked, “What is the name of this marvelous land?”"
3579,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3580,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"And the answer was, “France the glorious.”"
3581,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3582,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"I advanced again, when I was struck by the red color of a large"
3583,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,river.... It was a river of warm blood that rolled down from afar in
3584,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,thick and heavy waves. I advanced again. Before me dark clouds of smoke
3585,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,hid the endless sky above huge fields of warriors in battle; when these
3586,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"died smiling at death others took their places, singing."
3587,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3588,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"I asked, “What is the name of this chivalrous land?”"
3589,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3590,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"And the answer was, “France the courageous.”"
3591,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3592,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"At last I came to an immense city, of which I saw neither the beginning"
3593,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"nor the end, a city full of sumptuous palaces, of parks, and fountains."
3594,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"The sun glistened on the marble of the streets and kissed the serene,"
3595,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,resigned faces of women clothed in black. The chimes of churches filled
3596,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"the air with solemn sounds, and words, until then unknown to me, “Te"
3597,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"Deum,” came from the throats of thousands of thousands."
3598,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3599,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"With respect I asked, “What is the name of this land that mourns?”"
3600,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,
3601,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,"And the answer was, “France the victorious.”"
3602,IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,

3640,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,The traditional friendship between the United States and France was
3641,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,recemented under the fire of German guns. In France they celebrated
3642,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"our Fourth of July; in this country, we celebrated the Fourteenth"
3643,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"of July, the anniversary of the fall of the Bastile. Yank and Poilu"
3644,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"are brothers in war, don’t mind the languages. The inextinguishable"
3645,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"humor of France never showed more quaintly than in that word,"
3646,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"“Poilu.” It means “unshaven.” More freely, “a man who needs a"
3647,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,shave.” A whimsical comment upon the French soldier’s way of
3648,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,letting his beard grow while he is in the field. Those boys were
3649,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,like the English and our own. They smiled at misery. They were good

4527,EDGAR A. GUEST,Waited each spring t’ tell him all
4528,EDGAR A. GUEST,They’d done and seen since ’way last fall.
4529,EDGAR A. GUEST,He was the first to greet ’em here
4530,EDGAR A. GUEST,"An’ hoppin’ there from limb t’ limb,"

4532,EDGAR A. GUEST,An’ now I wonder what they’ll say
4533,EDGAR A. GUEST,When they are told he’s marched away.
4534,EDGAR A. GUEST,

4623,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”
4624,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,
4625,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,
4626,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,British soldiers in France have developed a terminology that is plain to
4627,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,"them, but confusing to civilians. They speak of “Blighty,” for example,"
4628,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,and of “Gone West.” These two terms express hopes--Blighty meaning home;
4629,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,"in common acceptance, home for rest and recuperation. “Gone West” means"
4630,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,"gone from the east with its conflict to the refuge of death, where peace"
4631,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,waits in the glory of sunset.
4632,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,
4633,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,“Blighty” is of Hindu origin. British officers in South Africa who had
4634,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,"served in India used the word, which is an Anglicized form of the Indian"
4635,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,"word “vilayti,” meaning European. Englishmen being about the only"
4636,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,"Europeans the natives knew, its application narrowed down to England"
4637,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,only; and the army fell into a way of using it as a synonym of home.
4638,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,"When the troops from India came into action early in the war, their"
4639,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,"wounded were sent to the nearest English great hospital, at Brighton,"
4640,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,just across the channel. The consonance of Brighton and vilayti or
4641,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,Blighty was so close that these men used their own word as a matter of
4642,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,"course, and in this way it floated into general use."
4643,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,
4644,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,It has acquired a new sense of late. Casualties intermediate to those
4645,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,"too severe for removal and those that can be treated in field hospitals,"
4646,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,"are sent to England--to Blighty--and are themselves called Blighty,"
4647,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,meaning wounds that get a man home. Lieut. Siegfried Sassoon has woven
4648,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,the idea into a plaintively whimsical bit of verse which he calls
4649,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,
4650,“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”,

4656,BLIGHTY,He woke: the clank and racket of the train
4657,BLIGHTY,"Kept time with angry throbbings in his brain,"
4658,BLIGHTY,At last he lifted his bewildered eyes
4659,BLIGHTY,"And blinked, and rolled them sidelong; hills and skies."
4660,BLIGHTY,"Heavily wooded, hot with August haze,"
4661,BLIGHTY,"And, slipping backward, golden for his gaze,"
4662,BLIGHTY,Acres of harvest.
4663,BLIGHTY,
4664,BLIGHTY,Feebly now he drags
4665,BLIGHTY,Exhausted ego back from glooms and quags
4666,BLIGHTY,"And blasting tumult, terror, hurtling glare,"
4667,BLIGHTY,"To calm and brightness, havens of sweet air."
4668,BLIGHTY,
4669,BLIGHTY,"He sighed, confused; then drew a cautious breath;"
4670,BLIGHTY,This level journeying was no ride through death.
4671,BLIGHTY,"“If I were dead,” he mused, “there’d be no thinking--"
4672,BLIGHTY,"Only some plunging underworld of sinking,"
4673,BLIGHTY,"And hueless, shifting welter where I’d drown.”"
4674,BLIGHTY,Then he remembered that his name was Brown.
4675,BLIGHTY,
4676,BLIGHTY,"But was he back in Blighty? Slow he turned,"
4677,BLIGHTY,Till in his heart thanksgiving leaped and burned.
4678,BLIGHTY,"There shone the blue serene, the prosperous land,"
4679,BLIGHTY,"Trees, cows and hedges; skipping these he scanned,"
4680,BLIGHTY,"Large, friendly names that change not with the year,"
4681,BLIGHTY,"Lung Tonic, Mustard, Liver Pills and Beer."
4682,BLIGHTY,
4683,BLIGHTY,"Hugh Pendexter, in Adventure Magazine, says “going west,” as used by the"
4684,BLIGHTY,"men overseas to mean death, is of peculiarly American origin. The Karok"
4685,BLIGHTY,Indians of California believed the spirit of the good Karok went to the
4686,BLIGHTY,“happy western land.” The Cherokee myths picture the west as the “ghost
4687,BLIGHTY,"country,” the twilight land where go the dead. The Shawnee tell of the"
4688,BLIGHTY,boy who “traveled west” to find his sister in the spirit land. The
4689,BLIGHTY,"Chippewa believes the spirit “followed a wide, beaten path toward the"
4690,BLIGHTY,west.” The spirit world of the Fox Indians is at the setting of the
4691,BLIGHTY,"sun. And so on, in the theology of many Indian nations we find the West"
4692,BLIGHTY,as the storied abode of the great majority--who have passed over.

4919,KNITTING SOCKS,"Click, click! how the needles go"
4920,KNITTING SOCKS,"Through the busy fingers, to and fro--"
4921,KNITTING SOCKS,"With no bright colors of berlin wool,"
4922,KNITTING SOCKS,Delicate hands today are full:
4923,KNITTING SOCKS,"Only a yarn of deep, dull blue,"
4924,KNITTING SOCKS,Socks for the feet of the brave and true.
4925,KNITTING SOCKS,"Yet click, click, how the needles go,"
4926,KNITTING SOCKS,’Tis a power within that nerves them so.
4927,KNITTING SOCKS,"In the sunny hours of the bright spring day,"
4928,KNITTING SOCKS,And still in the night time far away.
4929,KNITTING SOCKS,"Maiden, mother, grandame sit"
4930,KNITTING SOCKS,Earnest and thoughtful while they knit.
4931,KNITTING SOCKS,"Many the silent prayers they pray,"
4932,KNITTING SOCKS,Many the tear drops brushed away.
4933,KNITTING SOCKS,"While busy on the needles go,"
4934,KNITTING SOCKS,"Widen and narrow, heel and toe."
4935,KNITTING SOCKS,The grandame thinks with a thrill of pride
4936,KNITTING SOCKS,How her mother knit and spun beside
4937,KNITTING SOCKS,For that patriot band in olden days
4938,KNITTING SOCKS,Who died the Stars and Stripes to raise--
4939,KNITTING SOCKS,Now she in turn knits for the brave
4940,KNITTING SOCKS,Who’d die that glorious flag to save.
4941,KNITTING SOCKS,"She is glad, she says, “the boys” have gone,"
4942,KNITTING SOCKS,’Tis just as their grandfathers would have done.
4943,KNITTING SOCKS,"But she heaves a sigh and the tears will start,"
4944,KNITTING SOCKS,For “the boys” were the pride of grandame’s heart.
4945,KNITTING SOCKS,"The mother’s look is calm and high,"
4946,KNITTING SOCKS,God only hears her soul’s deep cry--
4947,KNITTING SOCKS,"In Freedom’s name, at Freedom’s call,"
4948,KNITTING SOCKS,She gave her sons--in them her all.
4949,KNITTING SOCKS,"The maiden’s cheek wears a paler shade,"
4950,KNITTING SOCKS,But the light in her eyes is undismayed.
4951,KNITTING SOCKS,"Faith and hope give strength to her sight,"
4952,KNITTING SOCKS,She sees a red dawn after the night.
4953,KNITTING SOCKS,"Oh, soldiers brave, will it brighten the day,"
4954,KNITTING SOCKS,"And shorten the march on the weary way,"
4955,KNITTING SOCKS,To know that at home the loving and true
4956,KNITTING SOCKS,Are knitting and hoping and praying for you?
4957,KNITTING SOCKS,"Soft are the voices when speaking your name,"
4958,KNITTING SOCKS,Proud are their glories when hearing your fame.
4959,KNITTING SOCKS,And the gladdest hour in their lives will be
4960,KNITTING SOCKS,When they greet you after the victory.

5364,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,
5365,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,
5366,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,I enlisted in the infantry last summer;
5367,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,I was greeted at the training camp with joy;
5368,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"I had hardly gotten settled, when a sergeant"
5369,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,Told me I was now the Company’s errand boy.
5370,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"Now, I knew I’d have to start in at the bottom,"
5371,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,And acquire my army training bit by bit;
5372,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"But to be assigned to duties quite so humble,"
5373,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"Was humiliating, surely you’ll admit."
5374,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,
5375,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,My first errand was a trip to Field Headquarters.
5376,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,It was raining and the mud was deep and thick.
5377,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"I was ordered to seek out the Major General,"
5378,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,And procure a requisition for a brick.
5379,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"’Twas explained to me, before I left my Company,"
5380,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"That our Captain suffered much with chilly feet,"
5381,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"And that bricks, when rightly heated, would correct this."
5382,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"What that Major General said, I’ll not repeat."
5383,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,
5384,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"To our surly Regimental Quartermaster,"
5385,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"I was sent to get the Company’s Sunday hats,"
5386,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"And my Sergeant said, “to save myself some walking,”"
5387,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,I could “also get the First Lieutenant’s spats”;
5388,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,When I told that sour Quartermaster’s seageant
5389,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"What it was I’d like to have for Company A,"
5390,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"Gosh, he “bawled me out,” said “Your ears should be longer,"
5391,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,And your rations should be changed from beans to hay.”
5392,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,
5393,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,For a thousand feet of skirmish line I hunted
5394,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"For a half a day, before I saw the joke;"
5395,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"Next they sent me for a left-hand canvas stretcher,"
5396,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"To repair the Mess-hall windows, which were broke."
5397,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"As the Company Street was slightly rough and bumpy,"
5398,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,They dispatched me for a double-jointed plow;
5399,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"And one breakfast-time they sent me to the Colonel,"
5400,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"With a pail, to milk the Regimental cow."
5401,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,
5402,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"Then one day the Sergeant said, “You’ve been promoted."
5403,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"You’re now morning call-boy for the Regiment,"
5404,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"And each morning, bright and early, you will sprinkle"
5405,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"Drops of water on each face, in every tent.”"
5406,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"In the morning I began my sprinkling duties,"
5407,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"And had sprinkled in about one dozen tents,"
5408,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"When a bunch of fellows rushed me to the hydrant,"
5409,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,Where they “soused” me good; since then I’ve had some sense.
5410,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,
5411,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"As I look back at the time I “ran the paddles,”"
5412,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,After having set me down in water wet;
5413,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"Rushing down between two rows of husky messmates,"
5414,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"With my arms above my head, I feel it yet."
5415,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"Now, I’ve graduated from the rookie section,"
5416,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"And the “awkward squad” will miss me in its ranks,"
5417,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"And I’m happy, for a bunch of bloomin’ rookies"
5418,WILLIAM L. COLESTOCK,"Have arrived. To those that sent them, Many Thanks."

5434,IN ADVENTURE MAGAZINE,No chance to even argue that I’d like to bet my hat

5550,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"Could feel within his soul upleap and soar, the sacred flame;"
5551,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"Could stand upright, and scorn and smite, as only heroes may:"
5552,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"Oh, harken! Let me try to tell the tale of Jean Desprez."
5553,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5554,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"With fire and sword the Teuton horde was ravaging the land,"
5555,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"And there was darkness and despair, grim death on every hand;"

5557,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"The wolves of war ran evil-fanged, and little did they miss."
5558,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"And on they came with fear and flame, to burn and loot and slay,"

5560,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5561,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"“Rout out of the village, one and all!” the Uhlan Captain said."

5564,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"For by this sacred German slain, ten of these dogs shall pay.”"
5565,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5566,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"They drove the cowering peasants forth, women and babes and men,"
5567,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"And from the last, with many a jeer, the Captain chose the ten;"
5568,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"Ten simple peasants, bowed with toil; they stood, they knew not why"
5569,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"Against the grey wall of the church, hearing their children cry;"
5570,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"Hearing their wives and mothers wail, with faces dazed they stood."
5571,ROBERT W. SERVICE,A moment only.... _Ready! Fire!_ They weltered in their blood.
5572,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5573,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"But there was one who gazed unseen, who heard the frenzied cries,"
5574,ROBERT W. SERVICE,Who saw these men in sabots fall before their children’s eyes;
5575,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"A Zouave wounded in a ditch, and knowing death was nigh,"
5576,ROBERT W. SERVICE,He laughed with joy: “Ah! here is where I settle ere I die.”
5577,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"He clutched his rifle once again, and long he aimed and well...."
5578,ROBERT W. SERVICE,A shot! Beside his victims ten the Uhlan Captain fell.
5579,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5580,ROBERT W. SERVICE,They dragged the wounded Zouave out; their rage was like a flame.
5581,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"With bayonets they pinned him down, until their Major came."
5582,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"A blond, full-blooded man he was, and arrogant of eye."
5583,ROBERT W. SERVICE,He stared to see with shattered skull his favorite Captain lie.
5584,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"“Nay, do not finish him so quick, this foreign swine,” he cried;"
5585,ROBERT W. SERVICE,“Go nail him to the big church door: he shall be crucified.”
5586,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5587,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"With bayonets through hands and feet they nailed the Zouave there,"
5588,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"And there was anguish in his eyes, and horror in his stare;"
5589,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"“Water! A single drop!” he moaned; but how they jeered at him,"
5590,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"And mocked him with an empty cup, and saw his sight grow dim;"
5591,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"And as in agony of death with blood his lips were wet,"
5592,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"The Prussian Major gaily laughed, and lit a cigarette."
5593,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5594,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"But ’mid the white-faced villagers who cowered in horror by,"
5595,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"Was one who saw the woeful sight, who heard the woeful cry:"
5596,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"“Water! One little drop, I beg! For love of Christ who died....”"
5597,ROBERT W. SERVICE,It was the little Jean Desprez who turned and stole aside;
5598,ROBERT W. SERVICE,It was the little barefoot boy who came with cup abrim
5599,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"And walked up to the dying man, and gave the drink to him."
5600,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5601,ROBERT W. SERVICE,A roar of rage! They seize the boy; they tear him fast away.
5602,ROBERT W. SERVICE,The Prussian Major swings around; no longer is he gay.
5603,ROBERT W. SERVICE,His teeth are wolfishly agleam; his face all dark with spite:
5604,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"“Go, shoot the brat,” he snarls, “that dare defy our Prussian might."
5605,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"Yet stay! I have another thought. I’ll kindly be, and spare."
5606,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"Quick! give the lad a rifle charged, and set him squarely there,"
5607,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"And bid him shoot, and shoot to kill. Haste! Make him understand"
5608,ROBERT W. SERVICE,The dying dog he fain would save shall perish by his hand.
5609,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"And all his kindred they shall see, and all shall curse his name,"
5610,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"Who bought his life at such a cost, the price of death and shame.”"
5611,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5612,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"They brought the boy, wild-eyed with fear; they made him understand;"
5613,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"They stood him by the dying man, a rifle in his hand."
5614,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"“Make haste!” said they; “the time is short, and you must kill or die.”"
5615,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"The Major puffed his cigarette, amusement in his eye."
5616,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"And then the dying Zouave heard, and raised his weary head:"
5617,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"“Shoot, son, ’twill be the best for both; shoot swift and"
5618,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"straight,” he said."
5619,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"“Fire first and last, and do not flinch; for lost to hope am I;"
5620,ROBERT W. SERVICE,And I will murmur: Vive la France! and bless you ere I die.”
5621,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5622,ROBERT W. SERVICE,Half-blind with blows the boy stood there; he seemed to swoon and sway;
5623,ROBERT W. SERVICE,Then in that moment woke the soul of little Jean Desprez.
5624,ROBERT W. SERVICE,He saw the woods go sheening down; the larks were singing clear;
5625,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"And oh! the scents and sounds of spring, how sweet they were! how dear!"
5626,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"He felt the scent of new-mown hay, a soft breeze fanned his brow;"
5627,ROBERT W. SERVICE,O God! the paths of peace and toil! How precious were they now!
5628,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5629,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"The summer days and summer ways, how bright with hope and bliss!"
5630,ROBERT W. SERVICE,The autumn such a dream of gold; and all must end in this:
5631,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"This shining rifle in his hand, that shambles all around;"
5632,ROBERT W. SERVICE,The Zouave there with dying glare; the blood upon the ground;
5633,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"The brutal faces round him ringed, the evil eyes aflame;"
5634,ROBERT W. SERVICE,That Prussian bully standing by as if he watched a game.
5635,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"“Make haste and shoot,” the Major sneered; a minute more I give;"
5636,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"A minute more to kill your friend, if you yourself would live.”"
5637,ROBERT W. SERVICE,
5638,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"They only saw a barefoot boy, with blanched and twitching face;"
5639,ROBERT W. SERVICE,They did not see within his eyes the glory of his race;
5640,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"The glory of a million men who for fair France have died,"
5641,ROBERT W. SERVICE,The splendor of self-sacrifice that will not be denied.
5642,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"Yet he was but a peasant lad, and oh! but life was sweet."
5643,ROBERT W. SERVICE,"“Your minute’s nearly gone, my lad,” he heard a voice repeat."
5644,ROBERT W. SERVICE,“Shoot! Shoot!” the dying Zouave moaned; “Shoot! Shoot!” the
5645,ROBERT W. SERVICE,soldier said.
5646,ROBERT W. SERVICE,Then Jean Desprez reached out and shot ... _the Prussian Major dead_!

6445,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,
6446,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,
6447,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,There used to be a boy next door
6448,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,Whom I often have longed to throttle;
6449,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,I’ve wished a thousand times and more
6450,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,That he had died while “on the bottle”!
6451,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,Oft in the past it has been hard
6452,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"For me to check my inclination,"
6453,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"When he had cluttered up our yard,"
6454,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,To hand him heavy castigation.
6455,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,
6456,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,With freckles on his tilted nose
6457,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"And ears that far in space protruded,"
6458,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"He was not one, as heaven knows,"
6459,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,To whom I in my prayers alluded.
6460,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,Derisively he showed his tongue
6461,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"And scorned the warnings which I gave him,"
6462,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,But now I list myself among
6463,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,The ones who pray the Lord to save him.
6464,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,
6465,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,How vividly I can recall
6466,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"Him at the window, making faces;"
6467,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,I used to think that in him all
6468,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,The impish traits had lurking places.
6469,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"He stole the green fruit from my trees,"
6470,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,Not caring how it might affect him;
6471,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"Today he’s fighting overseas,"
6472,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,And may the God of hosts protect him!
6473,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,
6474,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"From childhood into youth he passed,"
6475,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,And then my little garden flourished;
6476,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,And still his friendship was not classed
6477,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,Among the treasures which I nourished.
6478,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"He tortured first a slide trombone,"
6479,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,And next he tried a squeaky fiddle;
6480,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,His voice took on a raucous tone
6481,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,That used to rasp me down the middle.
6482,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,
6483,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,How soldierly our lad appeared
6484,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,When with his comrades he departed!
6485,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"I wonder if he knew I cheered,"
6486,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,Or guessed that I was heavy-hearted.
6487,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,If I have damned him heretofore
6488,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,I now retract each foul aspersion;
6489,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,"God bless the boy who lived next door,"
6490,IN THE SATURDAY EVENING POST,And used to be my pet aversion!

7389,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,Black with the blackness of hell and despair
7390,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,Village and village and village lay there;
7391,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,Never a candle and never a lamp--
7392,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,Four hundred miles of the enemies’ camp.
7393,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,
7394,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,"Trains of munitions that creak with their loads,"
7395,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,"Supplies, horses, soldiers engulfed by the roads;"

7397,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,Through the shell-shattered houses the marching of men.
7398,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,
7399,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,Black with the blackness of wounds and of death
7400,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,The villages huddled there holding their breath;
7401,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,Black--till there rang this new order to “Cease”--
7402,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,“It is over!--all over!--the war!--_there is peace!_
7403,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,

7407,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,But turn it to day--and let there be light.
7408,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,
7409,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,"The sorrow unburied, destruction--how much!"
7410,IN THE RED CROSS MAGAZINE,Four hundred long miles for the taper to touch!

7456,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,On where they made the great mistake
7457,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,And nearly lost the day.
7458,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,
7459,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"They fight it o’er from A to Z,"

7503,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"Out in that vague, vast “somewhere” of The Line"
7504,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"They killed Old Jim, a proven friend of mine."
7505,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"Killed him at night, while he was on patrol;"
7506,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,All the company found was just a hole
7507,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,A damned boche shell had dug out where he’d gone.
7508,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,The outfit passed the place just after dawn
7509,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,And saw some bodies; but they couldn’t tell
7510,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,Which one was which. They all were smashed to hell!
7511,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"They put Jim on the list, “Reported Dead”;"
7512,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"“Missing in Action,” the home papers said."
7513,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,
7514,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,I wasn’t in The Line when Jim went out.
7515,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,A piece of shrapnel had hit me a clout
7516,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,Which kept me pretty quiet for a while--
7517,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,Gray days when it was mighty hard to smile.
7518,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,And when I learned Old Jim had topped the ridge
7519,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,I fell to thinking what a privilege
7520,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,It was to know him. Jim was just the kind
7521,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,That stops to pet a dog or help the blind.
7522,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"The sort you turn to when things don’t go right,"
7523,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,And then forget when all the world is bright.
7524,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,Jim had a kindly eye that seemed to see
7525,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,The best in men. What could he see in me?
7526,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,I never knew; but Jim was always glad
7527,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,To give me half of everything he had.
7528,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"That’s why, you see, it cut me mighty deep"
7529,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,To know Old Jim was Out There--in a heap.
7530,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,
7531,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,I’ve said Old Jim was not identified.
7532,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,All the outfit ever knew was--he died!
7533,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,And though there is no way to prove it’s so
7534,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,This Unknown Soldier is Old Jim. I know!
7535,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"The Congress Medal and the D. S. C.,"
7536,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,Have been given this Lost Identity;
7537,IN THE STARS AND STRIPES,"And knowing that they both were earned by him,"

7557,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,
7558,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,The gripping clay once more gives way before the Mighty Mother
7559,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,Who waits with everlasting arms to guard her sleeping sons.
7560,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,And lonely mates in silent fields call out to one another
7561,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"The story of an empty grave, where each has lost a brother,"

7563,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,
7564,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,Gently the east wind brought him home to meet the south wind sighing.
7565,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,Softly the north wind breathes his name that none of us may know.
7566,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"For only those who fell with him, out in the darkness lying,"
7567,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"Can tell his company or rank, and they are unreplying,"
7568,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,As each dreams on through summer dawns or mantling snow.
7569,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,
7570,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,Nameless--and yet how gallantly he faced the roaring thunder
7571,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,Where names were less than star-dust as the crashing steel swept by
7572,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"To take its endless toll of those the night squad spaded under,"
7573,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"Clod upon clod, beneath the sod that time alone may sunder,"

7576,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"He’ll miss, perhaps, the poppy blooms that sway above the clover,"

7579,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"Where out the friendly lanes of home, a gay and careless rover,"
7580,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"His wild, free spirit seeks the hills and haunts the singing streams."
7581,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,
7582,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"No more he moves by Meuse or Aisne, some shell-swept river wading,"
7583,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,No marching orders call him from his rough-hewn granite grave.
7584,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"And when at dusk we hear far off the eerie drum-taps fading,"
7585,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"What hallowed spot holds more than this, with spectral lines parading"
7586,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"Blood of our blood, dust of our dust, “the ashes of our brave”?"
7587,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,
7588,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"There will be tears from watching eyes, where rain and mist are blended,"
7589,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,There will be heartache in the lines where gold-starred mothers wait.
7590,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"But where the great shells fall no more, what vision is more splendid"
7591,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,"Than peace along the once-scarred fields, the last red battle ended,"
7592,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,Peace that he helped to bring again above the twilight gate?
7593,IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,

8077,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,
8078,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,“Come--let’s pretend!” has been the slogan of all childhood. A few gay
8079,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,feathers have transformed an everyday lad into a savage warrior; a
8080,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,sweeping train has given a simple gingham frock the dignity of a court
8081,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,robe; the power of make-believe has changed a bare attic into a gloomy
8082,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,forest or perhaps into a royal palace. These six plays will appeal to
8083,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,"the imagination, to the fun-loving nature and to the best ideals of all"
8084,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,children.
