42,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
43,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"Mr. Adolf Reiss, merchant, sits alone on a gloomy December afternoon."
44,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,He gazes into the fire with jaundiced eyes reflecting on his grievance
45,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,against Life. The room is furnished expensively but arranged without
46,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"taste, and it completely lacks home atmosphere. Mr. Reiss's room is,"
47,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"like himself, uncomfortable. The walls are covered with pictures, but"
48,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,their effect is unpleasing; perhaps this is because they were bought
49,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"by him as reputed bargains, sometimes at forced sales of bankrupt"
50,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,acquaintances Making and thinking about money has not left Mr. Reiss
51,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"time to consider comfort, but for Art, in the form of pictures and"
52,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"other saleable commodities, he has a certain respect. Such things if"
53,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,bought judiciously have been known to increase in value in the most
54,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"extraordinary manner, and as this generally happens long after their"
55,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"creators are dead, he leaves living artists severely alone. The essence"
56,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,of successful speculation is to limit your liability.
57,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
58,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"Mr. Reiss is a short, stoutish, ungainly man past seventy, and he suffers"
59,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,from chronic indigestion. He is one of those people of whom it is
60,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,difficult to believe that they ever were young.
61,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
62,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,But it is not on account of these disadvantages that Mr. Reiss considers
63,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,himself ill treated by Fate. It is because since the War he regards
64,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"himself as a ruined man. Half his fortune remains; but Mr. Reiss, though"
65,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"he hates the rich, despises the merely well-off. Of a man whose income"
66,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"would generally be considered wealth he says, ""Bah! He hasn't a penny."""
67,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"Below this level every one is ""a pauper""; now he rather envies such"
68,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"pitiable people because ""they've got nothing to lose."" His philosophy"
69,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"of life is simple to grasp, and he can never understand why so many"
70,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"people refuse to accept it. If they did, he thinks that the world would"
71,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,not be such an unpleasant place to live in. Life in his opinion is
72,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,simply a fight for money. All the trouble in the world is caused by
73,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"the want of it, all the happiness man requires can be purchased with"
74,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"it. Those who think the contrary are fools, and if they go to the length"
75,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"of professing indifference to money they are ""humbugs."""
76,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
77,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Humbug"" and ""Bunkum"" are favourite words of his. He generally dismisses"
78,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,remarks and stops discussion by the use of either or both. His solitary
79,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"term of praise is the word ""respectable"" and he uses it sparingly,"
80,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,being as far as he can conscientiously go in approval of any one; he
81,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,thus eulogizes those who live within their means and have never been
82,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"known to be hard up. People who are hard up are ""wasters."" No one has"
83,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"any business to be hard up; ""respectable"" men live on what they've"
84,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,got. If any one were to ask him how people are to live within their
85,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"means when they've not got any, he would reply with the word ""bunkum"""
86,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,and clinch the argument with a grunt. It will be understood that
87,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,conversation with Mr. Adolf Reiss is not easy.
88,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
89,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,*       *       *       *       *
90,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
91,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,A knock on the door. Mr. Reiss's servant announces some one and
92,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,withdraws.
93,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
94,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"Intuitively Mr. Reiss, who is rather deaf, and has not caught the name,"
95,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,grasps the paper and hides behind it. From long experience he has
96,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,discovered the utility of the newspaper as a sort of parapet
97,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,behind which he can better await attack.
98,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
99,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"A slight figure in khaki advances into the room, observes the newspaper"
100,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,above the legs and smiles slightly.
101,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
102,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Hello, uncle!"" It's a fresh young voice."
103,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
104,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"Mr. Reiss grunts, slowly lowers the paper and gazes at the youth over"
105,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,his eyeglasses.
106,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
107,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Oh, it's you. When did you come up?"""
108,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
109,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Just arrived, uncle. We're ordered out. I thought I'd look you up"
110,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"at once as there are one or two things--"""
111,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
112,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Eh--what?"""
113,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
114,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,Among Mr. Reiss's characteristics is a disconcerting habit of making
115,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,people repeat their remarks. This is deliberate and its purpose
116,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,twofold--to gain time and to embarrass the person addressed.
117,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
118,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,The young fellow sits down rather uncomfortably and begins again--
119,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
120,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""We're ordered out, you know--"""
121,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
122,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""No, I didn't know. How could I? You never write--"""
123,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
124,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,Mr. Reiss consolidates his defence with the pretence of a grievance.
125,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
126,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""I didn't know myself until yesterday. They don't give one much time,"
127,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"you know."""
128,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
129,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""They--who?"""
130,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
131,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""The War Office people. You see, our first battalion has had a lot"
132,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,of casualties and three of us subs are being taken from the third.
133,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,We've got to join the day after to-morrow. Bit of a rush. And I've
134,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"got things to get. I'm afraid I must ask you to give me a leg up, uncle."
135,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"I'm a bit short--"""
136,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
137,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Short? Why, you've got an ample allowance besides your pay and the"
138,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"Government pays for your outfit at an extravagant rate."" Mr. Reiss"
139,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,never ceases denouncing the extravagance of the Government. He now
140,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"adjusts his glasses and glowers at the youngster, who fidgets under"
141,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"the scrutiny. ""Yes, I know. I--"" he stammers."
142,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
143,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Well--well?"""
144,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
145,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""The fact is--when Staples, our captain, went back--he--I--"""
146,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
147,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"A grunt. Then, ""Eh--what?"""
148,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
149,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""He was engaged, you know."""
150,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
151,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Well--well?"" irritably."
152,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
153,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""I can't explain, uncle, if you don't give me a chance."""
154,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
155,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,Another grunt.
156,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
157,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Jimmie--I mean Staples--wanted to give his girl a ring before he went"
158,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"back. He hadn't enough money--so I lent him fifty pounds."""
159,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
160,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"Mr. Reiss drops his glasses, gets up from his chair, and stands before"
161,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"the fire, facing his nephew."
162,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
163,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""So you lent him fifty pounds, did you? A third of your annual allowance."
164,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,You had no business to--and if Captain Whatever's-his-name were a
165,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"respectable man, he would have saved the money to pay for the ring."
166,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"Instead of that _I_ have to pay for it."""
167,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
168,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Oh no, uncle."""
169,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
170,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""How d'you mean--'no, uncle'? Aren't you asking me for money? It's"
171,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,always the same story with the lot of you. You like to be generous
172,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,at other people's expense. I've told you I'm a ruined man. The fortune
173,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,which was the result of my hard work all my life has disappeared. I'm
174,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,a poor man. I spend nothing on myself. I've given up my car. I've put
175,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,down everything. I'm trying to dispose of my pictures and to sell the
176,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,lease of this place. You don't seem to understand what this infernal
177,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,war means to people like myself. _You_ don't have to pay for it.
178,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,Do you realize that one-third of my entire income goes for income
179,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"tax? I've paid your bills over and over again, but I can't do it any"
180,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"more. For this once I'll--"" The boy holds up his hand."
181,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
182,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Look here, uncle. I'd better tell you at once. I shall need another"
183,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"fifty to make me square. But I'll pay you back--on my honour--"""
184,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
185,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""Bah! Your honour! Pay me back. I know what that means. So it's a hundred"
186,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,pounds you want. Very well. You shall have your hundred pounds. But
187,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,I solemnly warn you that it's the last penny I intend to pay for your
188,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"extravagance. As for that waster of a Captain What's-his--"""
189,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
190,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"The boy flushes to the roots of his light, wavy hair."
191,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
192,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""I say, uncle. He's not a waster. He's the finest fellow in the regiment."
193,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,I can't allow you--Look here--never mind the money. The jeweller knows
194,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"it's all right. I'd rather--"""
195,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
196,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,He stops. The words won't come. He gazes at his uncle helplessly. Mr.
197,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,Reiss goes slowly to the writing-table and sits down. Taking a blank
198,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"cheque from a pocket-book he always carries, he fills it in and passes"
199,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,it to the boy without speaking.
200,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
201,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"""I don't like taking it, uncle. I don't, really--"""
202,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
203,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"Mr. Reiss half turns round. He still says nothing, he does not even"
204,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"grunt. He knows that there are times when silence is golden. Moreover,"
205,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,he knows that money talks.
206,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
207,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"A few minutes later Mr. Adolf Reiss is again sitting alone, gazing"
208,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,into the fire. And he has another grievance against Life.
209,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
210,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,*       *       *       *       *
211,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
212,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,The philosophy of Mr. Reiss is a natural result of his early environment.
213,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"In Magdeburg, where he was born and brought up, education in business"
214,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,principles is combined with the theory of family duty. Whether this
215,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"theory takes the place of affection or not, its application in the"
216,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"case of Mr. Reiss resulted in his migration at an early age to England,"
217,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"where he soon found a market for his German industry, his German"
218,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"thriftiness, and his German astuteness. He established a business and"
219,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,took out naturalization papers. Until the War came Mr. Reiss was growing
220,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,richer and richer. His talent for saving kept pace with his gift for
221,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,making.
222,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
223,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"He spent evening after evening, when he came home from the"
224,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"City, thinking out different ways of tying up his fortune on Percy,"
225,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,so that it could remain intact as long as possible. Some of his schemes
226,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"for insuring the safety of his capital, for the resettlement of the"
227,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"greater part of the income by trustees--for combining, in fact, a maximum"
228,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,of growing power for the fortune with a minimum of enjoyment for the
229,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,heir--were really marvels of ingenuity.
230,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
231,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,But since the War his thoughts have taken a different turn. Half his
232,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,fortune has gone. He is too old now to catch up again. It's all over
233,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"with money-making. The most he can hope for is to keep ""the little"
234,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"that is left."" If only Percy had been older and had a son, he could"
235,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,settle the money upon his great-nephew. Then there would have been
236,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,time for the money to accumulate again.
237,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
238,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,And now he's gone to the Front. He might be killed. It doesn't bear
239,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,thinking about. He has toiled all his life. Surely after _all_
240,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,his self-sacrifice and self-denial he is not to be robbed of the one
241,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"satisfaction he asks for, to know that the beggarly remains of his"
242,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,wealth shall be safe after his own death.
243,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
244,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,Every day he scans the papers anxiously. His one preoccupation is the
245,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,daily casualty list.
246,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
247,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,*       *       *       *       *
248,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
249,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,"Spring is at hand, and though there is chill in the air Mr. Reiss is"
250,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,economical and sits before an empty grate. Self-mortification always
251,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,seems to him to be evidence of moral superiority and to confirm his
252,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,right to special grievances. He is reading a letter over again received
253,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,that morning from Percy. It bears the stamp of the Base Censor and
254,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,is some days old.
255,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
256,I. MR. REISS'S FINAL GRIEVANCE,
257,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,","DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,"
258,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",
259,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,","You remember my friend Jimmy Staples--the one I told you about, who"
260,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,","was engaged and I lent that money to? Well, he's been killed, or rather"
261,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",he has just died of wounds. He has done splendidly. Our Brigadier had
262,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",sent in his name for a V.C. I'll tell you all about it when I see you.
263,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",But what I wanted to say is that it's all right about the money. I've
264,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,","got lots in the bank now, and in another couple of months I shall be"
265,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",able to pay you back. One can't spend anything much out here. I'm quite
266,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,","fit, but I'm rather in the blues about Jimmy. Mother will give you"
267,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",all my news.
268,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",
269,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",Your affectionate Nephew.
270,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",
271,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,","P.S.--By the way, I gave your name as nearest relative in case of"
272,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,","accidents, to save mother."
273,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",
274,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",
275,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",Mr. Reiss has a curious and unaccustomed feeling of flatness as he
276,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",re-reads the letter. Somehow or other he does not want Percy to pay
277,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",him back that fifty pounds. He thinks he'll write and tell him so at
278,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",once.
279,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",
280,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",He sits down at the writing-table--the same one at which he had
281,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",written the cheque the last time he saw Percy. The scene comes back
282,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",to him with a strange vividness as he dips his pen in the ink. He
283,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",hesitates a moment before beginning the letter. Was there anything he
284,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",could say that would please Percy? He has a curious and at the same time
285,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",a strong desire to do something now--at once. He has never felt like this
286,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",before. Supposing he were to--A knock on the door. His servant brings in a
287,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",telegram. Why do Mr. Reiss's fingers tremble so? Why does Mr. Reiss begin
288,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",cleaning his glasses before he opens the envelope?
289,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",
290,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",He holds the pink paper under the lamp.
291,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",
292,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",
293,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",Deeply regret to inform you....
294,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",
295,"DEAR UNCLE ADOLF,",

304,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Sir Matthew Bale, baronet and Member of Parliament, appears to be,"
305,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"at first sight, a distinguished person. When you know him better, you"
306,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"ask yourself what misled you, and you reconsider his personality. Careful"
307,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"scrutiny reveals that he is a skilful imitation. On the other hand,"
308,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"he is not just a façade, for there is will behind the mask. His imitation"
309,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"is, in fact, the result of an endeavour to be, not merely to appear,"
310,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"distinguished, and he fails because, while the manner is there, the"
311,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,moral qualities which should support it are not. Though he does not
312,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"know it, this failure to realize his own ideal of himself is the fly"
313,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"in the amber. Sir Matthew was an ambitious man, and believed that all"
314,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"that was necessary in order to ""arrive"" was to will it sufficiently."
315,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Up to a point his career supports his theory, but not altogether; for"
316,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"while, considering where he began, he has climbed to a considerable"
317,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"height, Sir Matthew is very far from satisfied with his position."
318,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
319,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Sir Matthew is wily, but he is not able, and he is exceedingly ignorant;"
320,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,this ignorance even extends to matters in which he is directly and
321,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,personally interested. In most men this defect would have proved an
322,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"insuperable obstacle to success, but it has not been so with Sir Matthew"
323,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"because he is aware of his own shortcomings, and when he can't do a"
324,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,thing himself he is exceedingly good at getting some one to do it for
325,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,him.
326,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
327,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Nobody knows anything about his origin, but he began to make his"
328,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"living at an early age, and while still in the twenties he was doing"
329,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,well as a bookmaker.
330,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
331,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,Reggy Dumbarton owed him a good deal more money than he could ever
332,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"have paid, so, on reflection, Bale turned his back on bookmaking and"
333,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"started finance with large plate-glass windows in Threadneedle Street,"
334,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,and Lord Reginald Dumbarton as junior (very junior) partner.
335,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
336,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,The Dumbarton connection made the new office a rendezvous for young
337,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,bloods whose profession in life it is to induce their friends to
338,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,cultivate a taste for speculative investment. The growth of the business
339,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,demanding a wider financial knowledge than Bale's bookmaking experience
340,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"could supply, his discriminating eye discovered a promising additional"
341,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"partner in the person of Maurice Blum, who had survived two startling"
342,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"bankruptcies and an action against him for fraud. Bale, Dumbarton,"
343,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,and Blum now did so thriving a business that Bale started an elegantly
344,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"appointed flat in Mayfair, drove a phaeton and pair (it was before"
345,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"the days of motors), and was much about town with gentlemen of family"
346,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,to whom his partnership with Dumbarton afforded a useful and easy
347,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,introduction. An indication that at this time he was among the minor
348,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,celebrities may be found in the fact that a flattering caricature of
349,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,him appeared in _Vanity Fair_.
350,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
351,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"When his engagement was announced to Dumbarton's cousin, Lady Ermyntrude"
352,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Stanley-Dalrymple, elder daughter of Lord Belfast, a social personage"
353,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"and a power in the inner councils of the Conservative Party, it was"
354,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,suggested that there might be some connection between this rather
355,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,unexpected event and Lord Belfast's heavy losses on the Stock Exchange
356,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,and subsequent directorships and holdings of shares in his future
357,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,son-in-law's companies. Whether this supposition was well founded or
358,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"not, it can be said with certainty that Bale had secured at one stroke"
359,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"a footing in society and in politics, for shortly after his marriage"
360,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,to Lady Ermyntrude his father-in-law found him a safe seat in Parliament.
361,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
362,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Meanwhile Mr. Maurice Blum, who in the absence of his chief partner"
363,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"had been looking after himself as well as the business, presented an"
364,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"ultimatum. If Mr. Bale wanted to be a politician, Blum had no objection,"
365,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"but that meant, at all events at first, spending money instead of making"
366,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"it, and under the circumstances the terms of the partnership must be"
367,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,modified.
368,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
369,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,This was the nastiest blow Bale had yet received. He had regarded Blum
370,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"as his creature, and his resentment at what he considered his partner's"
371,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,treachery was deep. But his prudence and astuteness did not fail him;
372,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"he knew Blum's value, and he was aware that even if he were himself"
373,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"able to spare the time from his political activities, his knowledge"
374,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,was not sufficient to enable him to manage the growing business of
375,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,the firm.
376,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
377,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,In Bale's view wealth is a necessary accompaniment of
378,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"distinction. He longed to be aristocratically indifferent to money,"
379,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"and it humiliated him that not only was he not rich, but that to keep"
380,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,up the style of living his position demanded involved no inconsiderable
381,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"strain. And, as a matter of fact, his financial position was precarious"
382,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,and depended entirely upon the fluctuating and speculative income he
383,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"derived from the business of Blum & Co. Obviously, therefore, Mr. Maurice"
384,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,Blum was not a person with whom Bale could afford to quarrel. Wherefore
385,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,he mastered his resentment and accepted the change of the name of the
386,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"firm to Blum & Co., and the incidental reduction of his income that"
387,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,change implied with a smile on his face in spite of the bitterness
388,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,in his heart.
389,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
390,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"To a man less adroit than he, the change in the partnership"
391,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"might well have constituted a serious check in his upward career, but"
392,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,once more Bale's native resourcefulness asserted itself. This crisis
393,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,in his private affairs took place when the country was torn by
394,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,dissensions over Tariff Reform. He had early learnt to fish in troubled
395,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"waters, and the political upheaval gave him his opportunity; he promptly"
396,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"crossed the floor of the House and obtained, without paying for it, a"

401,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,Sir Matthew Bale is tall and slender; his head is well placed on his
402,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"shoulders, he has clear-cut features, a firm mouth with excellent teeth,"
403,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"and is clean-shaven. Although he is over fifty, he has plenty of hair,"
404,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"originally sandy, but now tinged with grey, which he parts at the side"
405,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,and brushes straight back from the forehead. He dresses with a certain
406,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"quiet elegance, and he has a way of drawing down his cuffs as he talks"
407,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"to you, and of placing the tips of his fingers together so that you"
408,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"notice his nicely kept nails. He speaks in a low tone, which he only"
409,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"raises when he forgets himself, and relies for emphasis on little"
410,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"restrained gestures adopted by him, together with other tricks of speech"
411,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"and manner, from his wife's male relations. In this he is unconscious"
412,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"of imitation, for he is by nature adaptable and his desire to be"
413,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,identified with the aristocracy is instinctive.
414,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
415,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"He has now associated himself with the extreme Radical and Labour wing,"
416,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,where it flatters his vanity to think he is regarded as an elegant
417,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"exotic. A constant saying of his is ""Keep your eye on labour,"" but,"
418,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"though they don't say so, the Labour Members keep their eye on him"
419,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,and regard his advances with distrust.

421,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"He has been active on departmental committees, and has on occasion"
422,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,served as chairman. It did not need a long experience to teach him
423,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,that whatever the ostensible object of these convenient arrangements
424,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"may be, their usual purpose is to throw dust in the eyes of the public,"
425,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"to burke discussion, and to save the face of embarrassed ministers."

603,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,Presently Klein was installed and Tarleton soon found him a most
604,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,assiduous and useful assistant. Without the loss of a moment he got into
605,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,touch with various chiefs of subsidiary departments and obtained
606,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"stenographers and typewriters, clerks and porters. Urged by Sir Matthew,"
607,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,he harried the Office of Works till they provided ample accommodation in
608,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,a fine building in a central position; from H.M. Stationery Office he
609,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"promptly ordered all sorts of indispensable supplies, and within an"
610,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,incredibly short time Sir Matthew found himself installed in sumptuous
611,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,offices with a fine committee-room and everything in as perfect order as
612,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,even he could desire. Tarleton was compelled to admit that Klein had
613,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,proved to be an acquisition.
614,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
615,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"""What did I tell you?"" cried Sir Matthew triumphantly. ""Trust me to find"
616,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"the right man, Mr. Tarleton, trust me. I always believe in demanding the"
617,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"impossible and I generally get it. If you're modest, you get left."""
618,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
619,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Tarleton could vouch for the truth of this observation, and he disliked"
620,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,the chairman more than ever.
621,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
622,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,In due course the committee held its first sitting. On Sir Matthew's
623,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"right sat Lord Milford, a wealthy peer of independent political opinions"
624,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"and great obtuseness, by whose social prestige Sir Matthew was greatly"
625,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"impressed; on his left Mr. Doubleday, the leader of the Labour Party"
626,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"in the House of Commons. Ranged on either side, according to their"
627,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"importance, sat the various other members of the committee."
628,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
629,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Sir Matthew's opening address, written for him by Tarleton, met with an"
630,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Excellent reception, and the proceedings developed smoothly."

634,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"As the weeks passed the work of the committee increased, especially that"
635,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,part of it which fell to the staff. Tarleton was worked off his legs. In
636,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,committee Sir Matthew was indisputably an adroit chairman. He knew how to
637,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"assert himself on occasion and play off the members against each other,"
638,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,and he showed the dexterity of a conjurer in manipulating evidence. But
639,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"outside the committee-room, entirely absorbed by the decorative side"
640,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"of his position, he talked and talked from morning till evening. Beyond"
641,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"receiving important persons, he did nothing. He was as incapable of"
642,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"composing a letter as of making a speech, and Tarleton had to write"
643,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,both for him. He would arrive in the morning when Tarleton was trying to
644,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,get on with urgent correspondence or to frame questions to be asked of
645,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"witnesses, and so take up his unfortunate secretary's time that it was"
646,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,almost impossible for him to get his work finished for the next meeting.
647,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"He made the most exacting demands upon his overworked staff, showing as"
648,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,little consideration for them as he did grasp of the mass of detail they
649,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"had to get through between committee meetings. Indeed, had it not been"
650,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"for the industrious energy of Klein, who had relieved him of practically"
651,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"all the routine work, ordinary correspondence and office supervision,"
652,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,Tarleton had to admit to himself that it would have been beyond his power
653,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,to carry on.
654,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
655,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"As the proceedings of the committee advanced, Sir Matthew's opinion of"
656,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"his own importance increased, and Tarleton's dislike of him grew into"
657,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"hatred. Gentle, unassuming, and sensitive, he had never so far"
658,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"encountered an individual like Sir Matthew Bale, who outraged all"
659,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,his finer feelings and susceptibilities a dozen times a day. And the
660,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,secretary swore between his teeth that if he ever got the chance of
661,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"tripping him up, once the committee was done with, he would take good"
662,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,care not to miss it.
663,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
664,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Klein, on the other hand, grew in Tarleton's esteem, and he felt he had"
665,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"done him an injustice, for which he was determined to atone if occasion"
666,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,offered.
667,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
668,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,The industry of the Alsatian was equalled by his perspicacity; he soon
669,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,fathomed the intentions of the chairman and understood that the chief
670,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,purpose of the committee was the exact opposite of that which its flowing
671,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,terms of reference were intended to convey.
672,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
673,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"In a small room, as far as possible removed from the one in which the"
674,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"committee had their meetings, Klein sat like a mole delving into"
675,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,documents and preparing the interim report for which the Government had
676,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"been pressed in Parliament. Here, when the day was over and Sir Matthew"
677,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"had at last taken his departure, Tarleton would join him. It frequently"
678,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,happened that they did not finish their labours until nearly midnight.
679,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"On such occasions Tarleton would go to his club to dine, whilst Klein"
680,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"would make his way to some neighbouring restaurant, but after a time the"
681,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"two men seemed to draw nearer to each other, until one day Tarleton"
682,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,suggested that Klein should dine with him. Over a cigar in the club
683,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"smoking-room, the secretary for the first time expressed himself freely"
684,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,to his colleague.
685,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
686,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"""I feel I ought to tell you, Klein, that at first I was foolish enough to"
687,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"feel a little--"""

691,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
692,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"""I know exactly what you mean, Tarleton, and I do not in the least blame"
693,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,you. You are probably not aware that many of us Alsatians have German

695,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,have for hating the Germans more than any Englishman can possibly hate

697,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
698,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,Klein's eyes flashed under their drooping lids. Tarleton warmed to him
699,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,and began to talk about the committee and especially about the chairman.
700,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
701,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"""This has been a tremendous eye-opener to me, Klein,"" he said. ""I must"
702,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"tell you that, in my innocence, I never imagined that the proceedings of"
703,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,a committee could be conducted in such a fashion. I must confess I do not
704,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"understand the object of it."""
705,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,

710,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"""What do you mean, Klein?"""
711,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
712,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"""It is quite simple. There are things which the Government does not"
713,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"desire to be known, and that is why they selected a man like Bale for"

717,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"""But we aren't,"" remarked Tarleton, ""and I think it's--something ought to"

778,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,a full attendance had been specially requested by the chairman. A

780,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Members who had desired to hear certain evidence, but the witness had"
781,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,suddenly left the country. The Labour Members had withdrawn to discuss

783,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,had been aroused. On a motion by the chairman the meeting had been
784,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,adjourned for four days.
785,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
786,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,All Sir Matthew's resourcefulness had been needed to avert for the time
787,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,further discussion. Before the next meeting he and the minister involved
788,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,would get together and discover a means of putting inconvenient
789,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,questioners off the scent.
790,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
791,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,The committee took their seats. The chairman now spoke in his smoothest
792,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"tone, his manner was genial and urbane. He smiled towards Mr. Small, the"
793,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"recalcitrant committee-man, as he glanced at the notes under his hand"
794,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,prepared by Tarleton.

807,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
808,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,To Sir Matthew's surprise no dissentient voice was raised. The resolution

825,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
826,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,Sir Matthew gasped and turned deadly pale. For an instant he felt as
827,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"though he would collapse, then, summoning all his will, he fought back"
828,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,the emotion which was almost choking him. By a supreme effort he
829,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,partially regained his self-possession and managed to assume an ordinary
830,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,expression. With one rapid and comprehensive glance he took in the faces
831,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"of Lord Milford and the committee, and with an immense relief told"
832,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,himself that they were one and all ignorant of what the proposal
833,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,signified to him.
834,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
835,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,Where had Milford obtained his information? How much did he know? While
836,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,these thoughts flashed through his brain the soft voice lisped on--

838,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"""Certain evidence has reached me which points to Mr. Blum's having"

844,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"necessitates inquiry."""
845,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
846,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,Lord Milford sat down. His expression was solemn; it was evident that he
847,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,was rather pleased at finding himself for once in the unusual position of
848,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,having something to say and saying it. There was a buzz of whispered
849,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"conversation round the table, then a sudden hush--the chairman was"
850,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,addressing the meeting.
851,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
852,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,For a moment Sir Matthew paused. Once more his eyes took in the room.
853,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"Where was the enemy? Just behind him, in his usual place, sat Tarleton at"
854,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,his table covered with papers. The secretary's face was white and drawn;
855,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,he was twisting his small moustache nervously; his eyes were fixed on the
856,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,chairman with a half-frightened expression.
857,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,
858,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,Once more Sir Matthew's eyes scanned the faces. Where was the enemy? And
859,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"now, at the opposite end of the table, he noticed, for the first time, a"
860,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,figure almost concealed behind the stout form of Mr. Small. It was Klein.
861,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"The two men's eyes met. It was only for a fraction of a moment, but it"
862,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,was long enough. In the concentrated gaze of the Alsatian there was
863,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"neither hatred nor vindictiveness, but only determination. The two"
864,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"wills were in conflict, and this time Sir Matthew knew he had met his"
865,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,master. In that instant he made up his mind.

867,II. IN THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE NATION,"""Gentlemen""--his voice was calm, his bearing unruffled; the old habit was"

894,III. WAR WORK,"Mrs. Dobson, though short and portly, carries her fifty-five years with"
895,III. WAR WORK,"buoyancy. She is a good-natured woman, with purple cheeks, a wide mouth,"
896,III. WAR WORK,and a small nose; one connects something indefinable in her appearance
897,III. WAR WORK,"with church on Sundays, so that one learns without surprise that she"
898,III. WAR WORK,"is a strict Anglican. She lives in the neighbourhood of Cadogan Square,"
899,III. WAR WORK,"and has five daughters, of whom two are married, to a well-known surgeon"
900,III. WAR WORK,"and a minor canon respectively. The beauty of the family is Joan, who"
901,III. WAR WORK,plays the piano and is considered intellectual and artistic. She spent a
902,III. WAR WORK,"year at the Conservatoire in Brussels, and often uses French words in"
903,III. WAR WORK,"conversation. Effie, the youngest, is an adept at games, and rather"
904,III. WAR WORK,alarms her mother by her habit of using slang expressions and the
905,III. WAR WORK,shortness of her skirts.
906,III. WAR WORK,
907,III. WAR WORK,"Soon after the beginning of the War, Lady Whigham having discontinued her"
908,III. WAR WORK,"days at home, Mrs. Dobson gave up hers, and as the other ladies in her"
909,III. WAR WORK,"circle followed suit, her chief occupation was gone."
910,III. WAR WORK,
911,III. WAR WORK,"Of course, like her friend Lady Whigham, she joined several committees,"
912,III. WAR WORK,but she was rather disappointed to find the meetings less sociable than
913,III. WAR WORK,"she expected. What Mrs. Dobson likes is a friendly, chat over a cup of"
914,III. WAR WORK,"tea; when you sit formally round a green table, you never seem to get to"
915,III. WAR WORK,know any one properly.
916,III. WAR WORK,
917,III. WAR WORK,"""It's so much nicer,"" she said to Maud, the eldest unmarried daughter, a"
918,III. WAR WORK,"bouncing young woman of generous proportions, ""to have something at your"

922,III. WAR WORK,
923,III. WAR WORK,"Mrs. Dobson always speaks of Maud as ""such a sensible girl""; spiteful"

926,III. WAR WORK,
927,III. WAR WORK,"Maud meditated deeply. ""Everybody seems to have thought of everything,"
928,III. WAR WORK,"mamma, that's the worst of it. You see, Mrs. Newt has that drawing class"
929,III. WAR WORK,for orphan boys; then there's Mrs. Badger's fund for giving musical

932,III. WAR WORK,
933,III. WAR WORK,"""That's just it. We ought to be doing something useful of that kind. It's"

942,III. WAR WORK,
943,III. WAR WORK,"Before any conclusion was reached tea was brought, and just then Joan"

946,III. WAR WORK,
947,III. WAR WORK,"""Who do you think I met at the concert, mamma?"""
948,III. WAR WORK,
949,III. WAR WORK,"Joan was evidently excited. She spoke almost breathlessly, and went on"
950,III. WAR WORK,without waiting for a reply.

957,III. WAR WORK,
958,III. WAR WORK,"""What else did he tell you?"""
959,III. WAR WORK,
960,III. WAR WORK,"""He hardly said anything. In fact, he didn't tell me even that. Mr. Mayo,"

963,III. WAR WORK,
964,III. WAR WORK,"""Perhaps it's a mistake, anyhow,"" suggested Maud."
965,III. WAR WORK,
966,III. WAR WORK,"""No, it isn't. I stopped to find out--about the next concert, I mean--and"
967,III. WAR WORK,"Mr. Mayo told me he had greatly distinguished himself, and I'm not a bit"
968,III. WAR WORK,"surprised either."" And Joan looked at her mother and her sister with an"
969,III. WAR WORK,"air of saying, ""What did I tell you?"""
970,III. WAR WORK,
971,III. WAR WORK,"""Well, he's sure to come and see us and tell us all about it,"" Mrs."
972,III. WAR WORK,Dobson remarked complacently.
973,III. WAR WORK,
974,III. WAR WORK,"""I'm not so sure of that!"" Joan spoke sharply."
975,III. WAR WORK,
976,III. WAR WORK,"""Nonsense, dear! he'll be only too pleased to, especially if we ask"
977,III. WAR WORK,"him--and now it's war-time I think we might. Bygones are bygones."""
978,III. WAR WORK,
979,III. WAR WORK,Joan sighed deeply. It was evident she meant her mother to notice it.
980,III. WAR WORK,
981,III. WAR WORK,"""Surely you've got over that little affair? You didn't seem to mind at"
982,III. WAR WORK,"the time. Did you now, dear?"""
983,III. WAR WORK,
984,III. WAR WORK,"""What could I do with you all against me?"" Joan's face wore an expression"
985,III. WAR WORK,of aggrieved reminiscence.
986,III. WAR WORK,
987,III. WAR WORK,"""We thought it for your good, Joan. He was only a music-teacher and had"
988,III. WAR WORK,"no means at all."""
989,III. WAR WORK,
990,III. WAR WORK,"""He was getting on splendidly, though. You forget that he had been"
991,III. WAR WORK,appointed conductor of a big orchestra to tour the provinces--when the
992,III. WAR WORK,"War came."""
993,III. WAR WORK,
994,III. WAR WORK,"""Yes, but the War put a complete end to that and to all his prospects. A"
995,III. WAR WORK,"nice time you'd have had to wait,"" said Maud."
996,III. WAR WORK,
997,III. WAR WORK,"""It's over now, so what's the good of talking about it? I daresay he's"
998,III. WAR WORK,"forgotten all about me long ago."" Joan sighed again and helped herself to"
999,III. WAR WORK,tea.
1000,III. WAR WORK,
1001,III. WAR WORK,Half an hour later Clara Whigham called up Joan on the telephone. The
1002,III. WAR WORK,"family was accustomed to these conversations, which were sometimes of"
1003,III. WAR WORK,long duration. The two girls were intimate. It was through Clara that
1004,III. WAR WORK,Joan had taken piano lessons at the Royal School of Music from Jack
1005,III. WAR WORK,Leclerc.
1006,III. WAR WORK,
1007,III. WAR WORK,When Joan left the room Mrs. Dobson turned to her elder daughter.
1008,III. WAR WORK,
1009,III. WAR WORK,"""Now, Maud, you're such a sensible girl--what do you think about this"
1010,III. WAR WORK,"young man turning up? He's sure to be after Joan again, don't you think?"""
1011,III. WAR WORK,
1012,III. WAR WORK,"Maud considered the question with her usual conscientious earnestness,"
1013,III. WAR WORK,while her mother sat anxiously watching her.
1014,III. WAR WORK,
1015,III. WAR WORK,"""Well, now,"" she said at length, ""supposing he does?"""
1016,III. WAR WORK,
1017,III. WAR WORK,"""What do you mean, Maud? I don't understand."""
1018,III. WAR WORK,
1019,III. WAR WORK,"""Well, I mean that the War has changed everything. Look at Dora Newt. She"
1020,III. WAR WORK,Wouldn't accept that young Mr. Firning because he was only a clerk in the
1021,III. WAR WORK,"bank. Now she's engaged to him, all because he's in the Army. Why, you"
1022,III. WAR WORK,"know, mamma, Clara told you herself the other day she meant to have a War"
1023,III. WAR WORK,"wedding."""
1024,III. WAR WORK,
1025,III. WAR WORK,"""I must say I was shocked that so well brought up a girl should talk so"
1026,III. WAR WORK,"lightly about marrying."""
1027,III. WAR WORK,
1028,III. WAR WORK,"""I know, mamma, but everybody's the same now; the War makes all the"

1030,III. WAR WORK,"captain and--"""
1031,III. WAR WORK,
1032,III. WAR WORK,"""I think perhaps you are right, Maud. The War does make such a"
1033,III. WAR WORK,"difference, doesn't it? I really think I shall encourage"
1034,III. WAR WORK,"it now that he has made a position for himself."" Mrs. Dobson was"
1035,III. WAR WORK,interrupted by the return of Joan with another piece of news.
1036,III. WAR WORK,
1037,III. WAR WORK,"""Oh, mamma,"" she said, more breathlessly than ever, ""Lady Whigham's going"
1038,III. WAR WORK,"to give a concert for poor artists, and she wants us to give one, too!"
1039,III. WAR WORK,"Isn't it a heavenly idea?"""
1040,III. WAR WORK,
1041,III. WAR WORK,"Though Mrs. Dobson knew nothing about art, and supposed that the only"
1042,III. WAR WORK,reason why people ever were artists was because they were too poor to be
1043,III. WAR WORK,"anything else, she heartily agreed to the suggestion, coming as it did"
1044,III. WAR WORK,"through Lady Whigham, and being so exactly the form of charity that she"
1045,III. WAR WORK,approved.

1075,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1076,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"It was attended by many ladies, of whom one was a dowager countess, but"

1081,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,Joan did not enjoy the concert as much as the others. She said the

1087,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,The 28th was fixed for the concert at Mrs. Dobson's. Joan would have
1088,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"liked to write to Jack Leclerc and ask him to recommend the artists, but"
1089,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"she wasn't sure how he would take it, and besides, she did not know his"

1092,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1093,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,As Lady Whigham had specially asked Mrs. Dobson to engage performers she

1104,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1105,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"There were five ""artists."" Three young men opened the performance with a"
1106,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"trio for piano, violin, and 'cello. The ladies who had had tea knitted"
1107,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,and conversed. When the performance was over they went into raptures
1108,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,about it. A middle-aged and melancholy-looking man with a beard followed.
1109,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"He was the feature of the occasion, having been strongly recommended by"
1110,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"Lady Whigham as a ""finished and accomplished vocalist."" He sang a series"
1111,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,of very modern French songs.
1112,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1113,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"""It sounds to me as if something was wrong,"" commented Mrs. Dobson to"
1114,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"Maud, who replied--"

1116,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"""Sh! mamma, they're not supposed to have any tune."""
1117,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1118,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"Lady Whigham in the front seat was applauding vigorously, so every one"
1119,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"else, especially Mrs. Dobson, did the same, with the result that the"
1120,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"accomplished vocalist sang them all over again, making exactly the same"
1121,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,faces.
1122,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1123,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,After that an old lady in a yellow wig livened things up with a rendering
1124,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"of Tosti's ""Good-bye"" in a cracked contralto. While the audience was"
1125,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"applauding, Joan noticed that Jack Leclerc got up. He was making his way"
1126,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"gently to the door, evidently anxious to escape observation. Her heart"
1127,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"was in her mouth, but she sat on stonily, determined that he should not"
1128,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,know she had seen him.
1129,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1130,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,At the door he encountered Mrs. Dobson.
1131,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1132,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"""So sorry, I must run, Mrs. Dobson,"" he said, holding out his hand."

1135,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"Joan will be so disappointed not to see you."""
1136,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1137,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"""Oh, thank you. The fact is--"" Leclerc stopped, looking a little"
1138,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,embarrassed. But Mrs. Dobson did not notice this and ran on--
1139,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1140,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"""And what did you think of the concert, Mr.--er--Captain Leclerc?"""
1141,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1142,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,The musician's professional conscience forbade a complimentary reply.
1143,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,
1144,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"""It was very bad,"" he said, ""except the old Frenchman. That woman had no"
1145,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"business to sing in public, and as for those youths who call themselves"
1146,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"artists--why aren't they in the trenches?"" And hastily touching Mrs."
1147,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,"Dobson's hand, he slipped away: the expression in her rubicund face was"

1155,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,with Lady Whigham was what Mrs. Dobson most enjoyed the whole afternoon.
1156,CONSTANCE WHIGHAM.,Meanwhile Clara drew Joan aside.

1215,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,other finished his tea and lay back in his chair.
1216,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1217,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Not at all, not at all, Stephen. A friend of mine, Mrs. Stillwell, wants"

1222,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1223,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""She is an old friend of mine, Mrs. Stillwell. I was best man to Tom when"

1225,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1226,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"Ringsmith glanced towards Peter; he said nothing, and there was a"
1227,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,moment's silence before the latter continued--
1228,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1229,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Tom didn't leave anything except the property, which goes to the boy;"
1230,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,he's at the Front. There are the two girls to provide for. I advised her
1231,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"to sell the pictures long ago, but she couldn't bear to part with them."
1232,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"Now, with new taxation and so on, she feels she must. It's a bad time for"
1233,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"selling, isn't it, Stephen?"""
1234,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1235,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""The worst."""

1237,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""What do you advise?"""
1238,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1239,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""I never advise; people must make up their minds for themselves."" Then,"
1240,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"as though it were an after-thought: ""What sort of pictures are they?"""
1241,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1242,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""There are a Corot, a Mauve, and a Daubigny, I believe. The Corot is said"
1243,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"to be a particularly good one."""
1244,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1245,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Um--what does she want for them?"""
1246,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1247,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""I don't think poor Mary has any idea about the price; she asked me, but"
1248,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"there's one thing I won't do, and that's to be mixed up in an art deal--"""
1249,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1250,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,Ringsmith's eyes flashed; he flicked the ash off his cigar angrily.
1251,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1252,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Mixed up--art deal! Then why the devil do you come to me?"""
1253,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1254,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,Peter Knott smiled at him benignly.
1255,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1256,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Oh! Because you and I are old friends, Stephen. I'm sure you'll treat"
1257,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"her better than any one else."""
1258,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1259,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,Ringsmith moved uneasily.
1260,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1261,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Why don't you tell her to go to some one else first? I like people to"
1262,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"fix their price before they come to me, then I can take it or leave it."
1263,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"They've got such fantastic ideas about the value of things."""
1264,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1265,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Oh, very well, if you prefer. I thought you'd be pleased I came to you,"
1266,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"but of course--"""
1267,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1268,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"Peter made a slight waving motion with his hand, dismissing the subject,"
1269,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,and began talking of other things.
1270,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1271,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"A quarter of an hour later he rose to go. He said good-bye, and was just"
1272,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,leaving the room when Ringsmith called him back.
1273,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,

1279,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1280,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,Peter Knott took a half-sheet of paper from his pocket and handed it to
1281,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,Ringsmith without comment. Ringsmith glanced at it and threw it on the
1282,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,table.
1283,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1284,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""All right,"" he said, ""leave it to me; I'll see what can be done, but"
1285,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"these aren't times to buy, you know."""
1286,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1287,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""So you said,"" Peter replied, and went gently out of the room."
1288,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1289,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,The next morning Ringsmith was early at his office. After looking over
1290,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,his letters he sent for MacTavish. The shrewd Scotsman was said to be the
1291,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"cleverest picture-buyer in the country. He came in, a tall, thin man,"
1292,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"clean-shaven, with wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. Ringsmith"
1293,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,doesn't stand on terms of ceremony with his employees: he comes to the
1294,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,point at once.
1295,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1296,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""D'you remember that Corot we sold to Peter Whelan of Philadelphia? When"
1297,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"was it--two or three years ago?"""
1298,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1299,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Certainly I do, Mr. Ringsmith."""
1300,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1301,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Can you say off-hand what we made on that deal?"""
1302,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1303,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""No,"" replied MacTavish cautiously, ""but I do remember what we gave for"
1304,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"it, and what we sold it for. There were a lot of expenses on that deal."""
1305,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,There was a cunning look in MacTavish's eyes as he added the last words.
1306,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1307,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Um, yes--what were the figures?"""
1308,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1309,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""We gave £4,000, but it included those ormulu vases which Joyce sold for"
1310,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"us at Christie's. You remember we were wrong about those, and it took"
1311,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"some of the gilt off."""
1312,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1313,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,Ringsmith's heavy eyebrows met in a scowl.
1314,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1315,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Well?"" he said irritably."
1316,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1317,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Whelan gave £7,500. He's a hard nut, you know."""
1318,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1319,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""That'll do now, MacTavish. I want you to go and call at this place, have"

1324,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,Mr. MacTavish lost no time in calling at Mrs. Stillwell's house. She was
1325,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"out, but had left a note for the gentleman from Mr. Ringsmith's, asking"
1326,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"him to look at the pictures, and expressing her regret that she could not"
1327,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"show them to him herself. She was quite unable, she said, to decide upon"
1328,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"a price, which she left entirely to Mr. Ringsmith."

1332,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,A few days later Mrs. Stillwell was writing to her boy at the Front when
1333,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"Mr. MacTavish was announced. She is a slight, refined, gentle-looking"
1334,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"little lady, and rose from her chair with some embarrassment. She had"
1335,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"never had anything to do with gentlemen like Mr. MacTavish before, and"
1336,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,hardly knew whether she ought to shake hands with him or not; but she did
1337,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,so with a gracious and slightly deprecating air. She felt she was under
1338,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"an obligation to him for giving him so much trouble, and she disliked"
1339,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,very much being compelled to talk to him about selling her pictures.
1340,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1341,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Won't you have a cup of tea, Mr. MacTavish?"" she asked, not knowing"
1342,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,exactly what to say.
1343,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1344,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"The tall Scotsman declined politely, and came straight to business."
1345,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1346,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""I've talked the matter over with Mr. Ringsmith, Mrs. Stillwell, and if"
1347,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"you're agreeable I am prepared to buy the three pictures for the firm."""

1349,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,Mrs. Stillwell half-rose from her chair.
1350,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1351,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Oh, thank you very much, thank you very much!"" she said hastily."
1352,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1353,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Purely a matter of business, madam. You may not be aware that in these"
1354,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"times buying pictures is a somewhat dangerous operation."""

1356,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Oh, indeed! I didn't know."""
1357,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1358,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"Mrs. Stillwell blanched at the word ""dangerous."""

1363,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""No, I suppose not, Mr. MacTavish."""
1364,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1365,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""You are still unable to fix a price, Mrs. Stillwell?"""
1366,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1367,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""I really--I--no, I don't think so. I have no idea what the value of the"

1375,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Mr. Ringsmith has decided to give you what I think may be considered in"

1379,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Oh, I'm sure that's very kind indeed of Mr. Ringsmith."" Mrs. Stillwell"
1380,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,was quite astonished; she had not expected nearly so much.
1381,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1382,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"MacTavish lost no time; he handed her a cheque, and in a few moments"
1383,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,took his departure.
1384,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1385,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"Some weeks passed. Ringsmith again occupied the deep leather chair, and"
1386,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,Peter Knott was announced.
1387,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1388,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Good afternoon, Stephen; thought I'd look in for a moment. No, thanks."""
1389,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,This in answer to Ringsmith's offer of tea.
1390,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1391,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Mrs. Stillwell told me about the deal, Stephen."""

1394,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1395,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,Peter Knott didn't answer the question.
1396,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1397,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""By the way,"" he remarked softly, ""her boy's just come back. Got shot"
1398,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,through one of his lungs. Extraordinary thing--miracle almost. He's made
1399,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"a marvellous recovery, thanks entirely to a motor ambulance being handy."
1400,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"They got him to the base hospital, and now he's almost convalescent."
1401,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"Aren't you glad you subscribed, Stephen?"""
1402,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1403,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Of course I'm glad. I don't give money unless I want to."""
1404,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1405,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""You are very good about it, Stephen--very. I was wondering"
1406,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"whether""--Peter Knott looked up at Ringsmith--""you'd feel like giving me"
1407,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,another little cheque. You know these ambulances break down dreadfully
1408,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"fast. Fresh ones are always wanted, and with the new campaign--"""
1409,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1410,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Really, Peter, you try me pretty high. It's give, give, give. You seem"
1411,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"to think that I've got a bottomless pocket."""
1412,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1413,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Not exactly bottomless, Stephen."""
1414,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1415,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""But I say you do. I can't go on like this. Every day there's some new"
1416,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"demand. Look at this."" He took a type-written letter from the table and"
1417,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,handed it to his friend. Peter Knott stuck his eyeglass into his eye and
1418,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,slowly read the letter.
1419,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1420,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""I say, Stephen, this must be the wrong letter. It's from those"
1421,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"wheelworks of yours, telling you they've got so many orders they can't"

1424,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1425,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Well, damn it! doesn't that mean more money, and the Government takes"
1426,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,pretty nearly all the profit. You seem to forget that money's wanted in
1427,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,business. I shall have to shut up shop if this goes on. D'you think
1428,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"giving employment to hundreds of workmen isn't worth something, too? I'm"
1429,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"thinking very seriously of closing Crossways Hall altogether; in fact, I"
1430,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"should, only that it would cost me almost as much as keeping it open."
1431,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,There's no man in the country who has done more in the public interest
1432,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"than I have, but there's a limit to everything."""
1433,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1434,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"Ringsmith scowled at Peter, who made no attempt at replying."
1435,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1436,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""By the way, Ringsmith, did you know Whelan is over here? I met him quite"
1437,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,by chance yesterday. Seems he's come over on a large Government contract
1438,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,for shells. He asked after you. Told me about a Corot you sold him some
1439,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"years ago. He seemed to think he'd paid a big price."""
1440,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1441,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Well, he didn't."" The tone of Ringsmith's reply was irritable. Peter"
1442,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,Knott stopped putting on his gloves and looked at Ringsmith inquiringly.
1443,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,
1444,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,"""Not a big price? He told me £7,500."""
1445,IV. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS,

1485,"V. ""BOBBY""","When War came, Julian Froelich, known to his friends as ""Bobby,"" found"
1486,"V. ""BOBBY""",himself in a situation which in his wildest dreams he had never
1487,"V. ""BOBBY""","contemplated. This is not surprising, considering that his mental"
1488,"V. ""BOBBY""",activities had been exclusively limited to procuring himself what he
1489,"V. ""BOBBY""","called ""a good time."" In that brief phrase could be summed up Bobby's"
1490,"V. ""BOBBY""","entire philosophy, and when he suddenly had to face a state of things"
1491,"V. ""BOBBY""",which from one moment to another swept away the groundwork upon which his
1492,"V. ""BOBBY""","life reposed, it is no wonder that he felt himself ""knocked out."" With"
1493,"V. ""BOBBY""",incredible velocity his friends were caught up and whirled in every
1494,"V. ""BOBBY""",direction like cockle-shells in a hurricane. Their haunts knew them no
1495,"V. ""BOBBY""","more, and before he could realize his personal concern with catastrophic"
1496,"V. ""BOBBY""",events Bobby became a disconsolate wanderer in search of the flotsam and
1497,"V. ""BOBBY""",jetsam which were all that remained of his demolished world.
1498,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1499,"V. ""BOBBY""","For a time Bobby was unnerved. At first singly, then by twos, by threes,"
1500,"V. ""BOBBY""","by dozens, those with whom his life had been spent--frequenters of the"
1501,"V. ""BOBBY""","restaurant, the racecourse, the tavern, and the theatre--followed one"
1502,"V. ""BOBBY""",another in a headlong race to the unknown. His brain reeled under
1503,"V. ""BOBBY""",successive shocks. He was awestruck by the appalling suddenness of death
1504,"V. ""BOBBY""","and destruction. Daring no inquiry, avoiding those whose faces he dreaded"
1505,"V. ""BOBBY""","to read, he forsook his former luxurious resorts and almost slunk into"

1508,"V. ""BOBBY""",Bobby will not easily forget those first few weeks of the War.

1511,"V. ""BOBBY""","influence by which he was surrounded, he tried to take his little part in"

1513,"V. ""BOBBY""",of age it is no easy task for any man to put the past behind him and
1514,"V. ""BOBBY""",begin afresh; for Bobby to have done so would have needed a strength of
1515,"V. ""BOBBY""",will and character which he never at any time in his life possessed. He
1516,"V. ""BOBBY""","did succeed in getting various jobs, but one after another he threw them"
1517,"V. ""BOBBY""",up. In each case he found a suitable excuse for himself and an
1518,"V. ""BOBBY""",explanation for his friends; there was always some insuperable reason why
1519,"V. ""BOBBY""","he was ""obliged to chuck it,"" and he finally resigned himself to a form"

1522,"V. ""BOBBY""","In the early months of the War, before restrictions were placed upon"

1525,"V. ""BOBBY""","by the War, the old habit was too strong to resist; the journey itself"

1550,"V. ""BOBBY""","their wives, sisters, and other female attachments. Some of these Bobby"
1551,"V. ""BOBBY""","knew, others he met, and not a few of them were well enough pleased to"
1552,"V. ""BOBBY""","accept his society, if only to profit by his ciceronage as evening"
1553,"V. ""BOBBY""",advanced. But on this occasion Bobby had no eyes for chance encounters.
1554,"V. ""BOBBY""","His time was fully occupied, and he had come to the conclusion that his"
1555,"V. ""BOBBY""",new acquaintance was the most tempting and fascinating creature Fate
1556,"V. ""BOBBY""","had ever cast across his path. He had, in fact, constituted himself her"
1557,"V. ""BOBBY""",permanent escort.
1558,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1559,"V. ""BOBBY""",Her chief occupation seemed to consist in visiting people who lived in
1560,"V. ""BOBBY""","various parts of Paris, where Bobby invariably accompanied her in the car"
1561,"V. ""BOBBY""","he had engaged chiefly for her benefit, and he observed that she had a"
1562,"V. ""BOBBY""",considerable acquaintance among people whom she came across at the hotel
1563,"V. ""BOBBY""",or in the various restaurants and theatres they frequented. But she
1564,"V. ""BOBBY""","never seemed to do more than bow to them, and though it was evident that"
1565,"V. ""BOBBY""","her appearance aroused flattering notice, she discouraged attentions and"
1566,"V. ""BOBBY""","was smilingly evasive when approached. Nevertheless, she was full of"
1567,"V. ""BOBBY""",engagements. One day she would have an appointment at eleven in the
1568,"V. ""BOBBY""","morning near the Arc de Triomphe, in the afternoon in the Boulevard"
1569,"V. ""BOBBY""",Malesherbes; the next day it would be near the Odéon in the morning and
1570,"V. ""BOBBY""",at a turning out of the Place Pigalle in the afternoon. On such occasions
1571,"V. ""BOBBY""",she would sweetly ask him to drop her at a certain place and to fetch her
1572,"V. ""BOBBY""",at a certain time; then she would disappear and Bobby would be left to
1573,"V. ""BOBBY""",spend the interval kicking his heels.
1574,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1575,"V. ""BOBBY""",She dressed modestly in a taste that was quiet and restrained. Without
1576,"V. ""BOBBY""","being beautiful, her features were clear-cut, almost strong, and there"
1577,"V. ""BOBBY""",was a radiancy about her smile and a gaiety in her brown eyes that Bobby
1578,"V. ""BOBBY""",found perfectly entrancing. She was no longer quite young; she might have
1579,"V. ""BOBBY""","been thirty; indeed, her hair, which was dark brown, was ever so slightly"
1580,"V. ""BOBBY""","touched with silver, but this seemed to add to her attractiveness, which"
1581,"V. ""BOBBY""",resided perhaps more in her complete naturalness than in any other
1582,"V. ""BOBBY""","quality. Bobby noticed that, unlike nearly all the women he knew, she"
1583,"V. ""BOBBY""","used no colour on her lips, and only lightly dusted her face with powder,"
1584,"V. ""BOBBY""",but her cheeks seemed always to have a bloom upon them as on grapes from
1585,"V. ""BOBBY""",a hothouse.
1586,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1587,"V. ""BOBBY""","He found her a most delightful companion, always ready to talk about the"
1588,"V. ""BOBBY""","things that interested him most and to go anywhere he liked, provided"
1589,"V. ""BOBBY""",that it did not clash with any of her private engagements.
1590,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1591,"V. ""BOBBY""",But never in his experience had Bobby been so puzzled. He simply could
1592,"V. ""BOBBY""","not make out who or what she really was. This mystery, if anything,"
1593,"V. ""BOBBY""","deepened her attraction for him. Her name was Madame de Corantin, and in"
1594,"V. ""BOBBY""","answer to his inquiry she told him her Christian name was Francine, but"
1595,"V. ""BOBBY""",he had not so far dared to call her by it. She had an extraordinary
1596,"V. ""BOBBY""",power of quietly checking any attempt on his part to make tender
1597,"V. ""BOBBY""","advances. He could not himself have explained how it was done, but she"
1598,"V. ""BOBBY""",contrived to make him feel that any suggestion of familiarity would put
1599,"V. ""BOBBY""","an end to their intercourse, and for nothing in the world would he have"
1600,"V. ""BOBBY""","risked it. Indeed, in his loose-endedness, he looked upon the whole"
1601,"V. ""BOBBY""",adventure as a special dispensation of Providence in his favour. Madame
1602,"V. ""BOBBY""",de Corantin was to him like a beacon to a lonely wayfarer who has lost
1603,"V. ""BOBBY""","his way in the night. To act as her escort and protector was, quite apart"
1604,"V. ""BOBBY""","from the deeper feeling she inspired, a new object in life for him."
1605,"V. ""BOBBY""",Ever since their first meeting his depression had left him; his existence
1606,"V. ""BOBBY""",had once more regained its savour.
1607,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1608,"V. ""BOBBY""","She had frequently asked him to post letters for her, and sometimes to"
1609,"V. ""BOBBY""","call at the hotel for them; her correspondence seemed to be large, and"
1610,"V. ""BOBBY""","the envelopes bore the stamps of various countries, chiefly Russia. She"
1611,"V. ""BOBBY""","spoke English and French equally well, with a slight foreign accent,"
1612,"V. ""BOBBY""","which she explained by saying that she was Russian by birth, but had"
1613,"V. ""BOBBY""","married a French diplomatist, who died in Brazil; she said, too, that she"
1614,"V. ""BOBBY""","had travelled a great deal, and had spent much of her time in South"
1615,"V. ""BOBBY""","America, where she had been in the habit of speaking Spanish. Perhaps,"
1616,"V. ""BOBBY""","had Bobby's companion been less attractive, he might have been more"
1617,"V. ""BOBBY""","interested in these matters, but he was absorbed by her personality and"
1618,"V. ""BOBBY""",troubled little about anything else.
1619,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1620,"V. ""BOBBY""","Ever bright, vivacious, and in good spirits, she awakened Bobby to a new"
1621,"V. ""BOBBY""",interest in life. The philosophy with which she regarded tumultuous
1622,"V. ""BOBBY""","events, the easy cynicism with which she dismissed a discussion which"
1623,"V. ""BOBBY""","bordered upon the serious, seemed to deprive him of any means of"
1624,"V. ""BOBBY""",enlightening himself as to her real sympathies.
1625,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1626,"V. ""BOBBY""",Several times he had suggested that some friend should join them at
1627,"V. ""BOBBY""","dinner or at the theatre, but she opposed it with a velvety firmness. ""We"
1628,"V. ""BOBBY""","are so well like this,"" she would say. ""Why should we spoil it?"" And"
1629,"V. ""BOBBY""",Bobby was delighted beyond measure.
1630,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1631,"V. ""BOBBY""",The days passed. Bobby's original intention had been to remain in Paris
1632,"V. ""BOBBY""","only a week, but he was fully determined to stop on as long as Madame de"
1633,"V. ""BOBBY""",Corantin accepted his companionship. If he stayed there until the end of
1634,"V. ""BOBBY""","the War, he did not care, provided he could be with her."
1635,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1636,"V. ""BOBBY""","About this time Bobby, waiting one evening in the hall of the hotel for"
1637,"V. ""BOBBY""","Madame de Corantin to come down to dinner, observed a familiar figure in"
1638,"V. ""BOBBY""","Staff uniform. It was Alistair Ramsey. They exchanged salutations, but"
1639,"V. ""BOBBY""","Ramsey's manner was marked by a hauteur which even Bobby, good-natured as"
1640,"V. ""BOBBY""","he was, could not fail to notice. At that moment Madame de Corantin"
1641,"V. ""BOBBY""","stepped out of the lift, and with a ""See you later,"" to which the"
1642,"V. ""BOBBY""","other responded by a curt nod, Bobby went to meet her. As she greeted him"
1643,"V. ""BOBBY""","she stood still an instant, apparently looking at some one behind him,"
1644,"V. ""BOBBY""",and Bobby turned sharply to follow her eyes. They were fixed on Alistair
1645,"V. ""BOBBY""","Ramsey, who was staring back at her with a look of astonishment."
1646,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1647,"V. ""BOBBY""","The restaurant was fuller than usual, but their table was always"
1648,"V. ""BOBBY""","reserved, and Bobby (who prides himself on his taste in such matters)"
1649,"V. ""BOBBY""",looked forward to the little compliment he regularly received for
1650,"V. ""BOBBY""",the appropriateness of his menu. But on this occasion Madame de Corantin
1651,"V. ""BOBBY""",seemed to be oblivious of menu and of Bobby alike. She sat apparently
1652,"V. ""BOBBY""","lost in thought, and, eating mechanically what was placed before her,"
1653,"V. ""BOBBY""","replied with monosyllables to Bobby's attempts at conversation. Then,"
1654,"V. ""BOBBY""","of a sudden, her face cleared like the sky on an April day."
1655,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1656,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Pardon me, my friend, I fear I have been very ill-mannered. I have"
1657,"V. ""BOBBY""","received an annoying letter, and was thinking about it."""
1658,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1659,"V. ""BOBBY""","Bobby was full of concern. ""Is there anything I can do?"" he asked."
1660,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1661,"V. ""BOBBY""","She looked at him with a half-smile. ""Who knows? Perhaps!"""
1662,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1663,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Do tell me. You know I long to be of use to you, and there is so little"
1664,"V. ""BOBBY""","that I can do."""
1665,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1666,"V. ""BOBBY""","""But who could do more? No lonely woman could ask for a more devoted"
1667,"V. ""BOBBY""","cavalier."" Her appreciative glance was nectar to Bobby. So susceptible"
1668,"V. ""BOBBY""","was he to the expression of her eyes, he would have been powerless to"
1669,"V. ""BOBBY""",resist anything they asked of him. But he had never been put to the test;
1670,"V. ""BOBBY""","on the contrary, she had accepted with demur even the comparatively"
1671,"V. ""BOBBY""",trifling services he had been able to render her. She was most
1672,"V. ""BOBBY""","punctilious in regard to any expense to which he was put, and insisted,"
1673,"V. ""BOBBY""","to his discomfiture, on paying her share of everything. At first they had"
1674,"V. ""BOBBY""","little quarrels about it, but Bobby had been compelled to give way to her"
1675,"V. ""BOBBY""",firm but gracious insistence.
1676,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1677,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Tell me, my friend""--her eyes played full upon him as she spoke--""who"
1678,"V. ""BOBBY""","was that gentleman you were talking to just before dinner?"""
1679,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1680,"V. ""BOBBY""",For a moment Bobby hesitated. If there were one man in all his
1681,"V. ""BOBBY""",acquaintance whom he would have preferred that Madame de Corantin should
1682,"V. ""BOBBY""","not know, it was Alistair Ramsey. Bobby had known him for a good many"
1683,"V. ""BOBBY""",years. The acquaintance dated back to a period when Ramsey was a
1684,"V. ""BOBBY""",comparatively young man of fashionable manner and appearance on
1685,"V. ""BOBBY""",half-commission with a firm of stockbrokers. Even then he aspired to
1686,"V. ""BOBBY""","smart society, but this social recognition involved an expenditure"
1687,"V. ""BOBBY""",considerably beyond his earning capacity. In those days Bobby had
1688,"V. ""BOBBY""",been of no small use to him. Many were the dinners to which Ramsey had
1689,"V. ""BOBBY""","done the inviting, he the paying, and if that gentleman of fashion was"
1690,"V. ""BOBBY""","not above accepting the lavish attentions of the man about town, whom he"
1691,"V. ""BOBBY""","regarded as quite outside his own world, still less was he averse to the"
1692,"V. ""BOBBY""","loans forthcoming at moments of embarrassment, accompanied by a thinly"
1693,"V. ""BOBBY""",veiled hint from Bobby that they were repayable only when circumstances
1694,"V. ""BOBBY""",permitted.
1695,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1696,"V. ""BOBBY""","Bobby was not calculating, but without any deep reflection on the subject"
1697,"V. ""BOBBY""","he knew that Ramsey was ""on the make,"" and it was not unreasonable to"
1698,"V. ""BOBBY""",expect him to have at least a kindly feeling for an old friend when he
1699,"V. ""BOBBY""","""arrived."" In this, however, he was disappointed. Though with the rise in"
1700,"V. ""BOBBY""","his fortunes Ramsey's vanity extinguished his sense of obligation, his"
1701,"V. ""BOBBY""",pride was not equal to paying his debts. Bobby may or may not have
1702,"V. ""BOBBY""",realized that his former friend's gratitude was of the same quality as
1703,"V. ""BOBBY""","his honour, but in any case he showed no resentment. He was sufficiently"
1704,"V. ""BOBBY""","accustomed to the ways of the successful to take them as they were, and"
1705,"V. ""BOBBY""","to pass over those characteristics to which, after all, they partly owe"
1706,"V. ""BOBBY""","their success. Indeed, had it been a question of introducing any one but"
1707,"V. ""BOBBY""","Madame de Corantin to Ramsey, he would have ignored the latter's"
1708,"V. ""BOBBY""",insolence and ingratitude alike and conformed to his habitual rôle as
1709,"V. ""BOBBY""",purveyor of amusement to all and sundry. For Bobby's dignity was not
1710,"V. ""BOBBY""","great, and the secret of the kind of popularity he enjoyed was in no"
1711,"V. ""BOBBY""",small measure attributable to his own lack of self-respect. But for the
1712,"V. ""BOBBY""",first time in his life Bobby's pride now asserted itself. At last he was
1713,"V. ""BOBBY""","being ""tried too high."""
1714,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1715,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Excuse me, madame, if before answering you I ask you why you are"
1716,"V. ""BOBBY""","interested?"""
1717,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1718,"V. ""BOBBY""","Madame de Corantin considered an instant. ""I shall tell you, my friend,"
1719,"V. ""BOBBY""","but not now."" She glanced round her significantly as she spoke. ""The"
1720,"V. ""BOBBY""","little story is rather private, and I should not care to be overheard."
1721,"V. ""BOBBY""","You understand?"""
1722,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1723,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Oh, please don't--please,"" he stammered, feeling he had been indiscreet,"
1724,"V. ""BOBBY""","but flattered all the same by the promise of her confidence. ""His name is"
1725,"V. ""BOBBY""","Alistair Ramsey. I have known him a long time."""
1726,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1727,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Is he an intimate friend of yours, monsieur?"""
1728,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1729,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Well, no, I can't say intimate, but I used to know him very well."""

1731,"V. ""BOBBY""","""What is his position in London?"""
1732,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1733,"V. ""BOBBY""","Bobby thought a moment. ""Do you mean his position now during the War or"

1735,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1736,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Both."""
1737,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1738,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Well, shortly before the War he had been made a partner in an important"
1739,"V. ""BOBBY""","firm in the Stock Exchange. He is supposed to come of a good family, and"
1740,"V. ""BOBBY""",he went about a great deal. One of those sort of men ladies like--asked
1741,"V. ""BOBBY""","out a lot, that sort of thing--good-looking, too, don't you think?"""
1742,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1743,"V. ""BOBBY""",The question was inspired by jealousy. The more Bobby thought about
1744,"V. ""BOBBY""",Ramsey the less he liked the prospect of introducing him to Madame de

1746,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1747,"V. ""BOBBY""","""I quite believe he is considered so,"" she replied evasively. ""But you"
1748,"V. ""BOBBY""","were saying--"""
1749,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1750,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Well, it's generally believed, I dare say it isn't true, that he was"
1751,"V. ""BOBBY""",made a member of that firm through being--ahem--a great friend of the

1753,"V. ""BOBBY""","you know, but as you asked me--"""
1754,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1755,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Oh please go on,"" Madame de Corantin said, holding her chin with both"
1756,"V. ""BOBBY""",hands and leaning her elbows on the table. Her eyes were looking closely
1757,"V. ""BOBBY""","into Bobby's, and he moved uneasily under their sustained gaze."
1758,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1759,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Just after the War began--Oh, I forgot to mention something: he is a"

1762,"V. ""BOBBY""","talks about Alistair Ramsey one can't help it. Through Mrs. Lockyard, he"
1763,"V. ""BOBBY""","got introduced to Sir Archibald Fellowes. It wasn't very difficult, you"

1782,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Well, you see, Ramsey and Léonie were more or less _collés_, and"

1801,"V. ""BOBBY""","Their table faced the entrance, and Madame de Corantin's seat enabled her"

1805,"V. ""BOBBY""",astonishment Bobby had noticed before had given place to one of mingled
1806,"V. ""BOBBY""","surprise and curiosity. He had exchanged his uniform for evening dress,"
1807,"V. ""BOBBY""","and wore a flower in his buttonhole. A waiter went towards him, and he"

1867,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Well, just as you arrived then, so some one else arrived once long ago,"

1873,"V. ""BOBBY""","""I was glad of protection going to America. It is not pleasant for a"
1874,"V. ""BOBBY""",woman to have to travel alone. I daresay some people would have
1875,"V. ""BOBBY""",misunderstood the position. My companion on that voyage was well known.
1876,"V. ""BOBBY""",He was a Prince of a distinguished German family. He was nothing to me. I

1878,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1879,"V. ""BOBBY""","The suggestion in her last remark was not very flattering to Bobby, but"
1880,"V. ""BOBBY""",he was too much interested to notice it.

1882,"V. ""BOBBY""","""On that same ship was travelling your friend, Mr. Ramsey. He knew the"

1887,"V. ""BOBBY""",to bitterness as he was capable of expressing.
1888,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1889,"V. ""BOBBY""","""He used to come up and speak to the Prince when we were reclining on our"
1890,"V. ""BOBBY""","deck chairs, but my companion did not encourage him. I think, Bobby, he"
1891,"V. ""BOBBY""","was like you--a little jealous. Anyhow, towards the end of the voyage I"
1892,"V. ""BOBBY""",received a note. It was handed to me by a stewardess. It was from Mr.
1893,"V. ""BOBBY""","Ramsey, and I handed it to the Prince. I do not exactly know what"
1894,"V. ""BOBBY""","happened, for I did not see Mr. Ramsey again, but from what the Prince"
1895,"V. ""BOBBY""","told me, he must have said something very disagreeable to Mr. Ramsey."

1897,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1898,"V. ""BOBBY""","She had hardly said the words when there was a knock on the door, and"
1899,"V. ""BOBBY""","Alistair Ramsey entered the room and stood before her, bowing. With a few"
1900,"V. ""BOBBY""","easy words the new-comer settled himself in a chair, and at the"
1901,"V. ""BOBBY""",invitation of Madame de Corantin lit a cigarette. Nothing in his attitude
1902,"V. ""BOBBY""","or in hers suggested that they had ever seen each other before, still"
1903,"V. ""BOBBY""",less that an embarrassing episode figured in the background of their
1904,"V. ""BOBBY""",earlier acquaintance.
1905,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1906,"V. ""BOBBY""","Madame de Corantin led the conversation by a few casual remarks, which"
1907,"V. ""BOBBY""","were immediately taken up by Ramsey, and in a few minutes they were"
1908,"V. ""BOBBY""","talking together as people do who, though they have not met before, have"
1909,"V. ""BOBBY""",known of each other for years. Ramsey brought in the names of common
1910,"V. ""BOBBY""","acquaintances, of places they both knew, with an easy assumption of"
1911,"V. ""BOBBY""",mutual understanding that what he had to say about them would interest
1912,"V. ""BOBBY""",her.
1913,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1914,"V. ""BOBBY""",As a rule his attitude in the presence of ladies was that of a man
1915,"V. ""BOBBY""",accustomed to the recognition of his ascendency.
1916,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1917,"V. ""BOBBY""",Perhaps this was one of the reasons of the quite peculiar hostility with
1918,"V. ""BOBBY""","which most men regarded him, but with Madame de Corantin his manner was"
1919,"V. ""BOBBY""","deferential, and it was clear that he was doing everything in his power"
1920,"V. ""BOBBY""",to ingratiate himself.
1921,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1922,"V. ""BOBBY""","Bobby took little part in the conversation, and Ramsey's demeanour"
1923,"V. ""BOBBY""",towards him was not such as to encourage him to do so. Ramsey had the
1924,"V. ""BOBBY""","assurance which comes from social success, and he took no trouble to"
1925,"V. ""BOBBY""","conceal the indifference, if not contempt, with which he regarded the"
1926,"V. ""BOBBY""",other man. His manner was alternately insolent and condescending; he kept
1927,"V. ""BOBBY""","his eyes fixed upon Madame de Corantin, ignoring Bobby's presence"
1928,"V. ""BOBBY""",completely.
1929,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1930,"V. ""BOBBY""","Glib of speech, Ramsey had a certain gift of humour, which displayed"
1931,"V. ""BOBBY""",itself in flippant witticisms generally at the expense of others. He
1932,"V. ""BOBBY""","undoubtedly possessed the art of provoking laughter, but there was always"
1933,"V. ""BOBBY""",malice behind his frivolity. In appearance he was elegant without being
1934,"V. ""BOBBY""","engaging, and one felt the spitefulness of the dark eyes beneath the"
1935,"V. ""BOBBY""","abundant hair, and the hardness of his mouth showed itself even when he"
1936,"V. ""BOBBY""",laughed. An onlooker could not have failed to contrast Madame de
1937,"V. ""BOBBY""","Corantin's two visitors, and an Englishman certainly would have done so"
1938,"V. ""BOBBY""",to the disadvantage of Ramsey.
1939,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1940,"V. ""BOBBY""","In spite of his German name Bobby was typically English in appearance,"
1941,"V. ""BOBBY""",and no one would have supposed that of the two he was the more
1942,"V. ""BOBBY""",cosmopolitan. As he sat now listening to the conversation his
1943,"V. ""BOBBY""",good-natured face wore an expression of perplexity and discomfort. Bobby
1944,"V. ""BOBBY""","was suffering the pangs of jealousy, and at every fresh sally of the"
1945,"V. ""BOBBY""",other he was watching Madame de Corantin's face to see its effect. No
1946,"V. ""BOBBY""","wonder, he thought, that Ramsey had few friends, and yet he could not"
1947,"V. ""BOBBY""",help envying the caustic readiness of his tongue and the skill with
1948,"V. ""BOBBY""",which he had so quickly turned the situation to his advantage.
1949,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1950,"V. ""BOBBY""","For an hour they talked until, in some subtle and indefinable manner,"
1951,"V. ""BOBBY""",Bobby felt that Madame de Corantin desired to be left alone. He had
1952,"V. ""BOBBY""",frequently had this experience with her; she seemed to be able to
1953,"V. ""BOBBY""","indicate a desire without expressing it, and he rose now from his seat"
1954,"V. ""BOBBY""","and wished her good-night. Ramsey did not move, and Bobby's heart sank"
1955,"V. ""BOBBY""","within him at the prospect of leaving his rival in possession, but, as he"
1956,"V. ""BOBBY""","took Madame de Corantin's hand, she held it an instant in hers, turning"
1957,"V. ""BOBBY""",at the same time towards Ramsey.
1958,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1959,"V. ""BOBBY""","""I am so sorry,"" she said to him, ""that our agreeable little party must"

1961,"V. ""BOBBY""","forward to seeing you both to-morrow."""
1962,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1963,"V. ""BOBBY""","Bobby was elated as he went out of the room, closely followed by Ramsey;"
1964,"V. ""BOBBY""","indeed, reaction prompted geniality."
1965,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1966,"V. ""BOBBY""","""I think I'll go round to Maxim's for an hour; it's quite early. Will you"
1967,"V. ""BOBBY""","join me? There are sure to be people you know there."""
1968,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1969,"V. ""BOBBY""",They were standing in the hall of the hotel.
1970,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1971,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Thanks, it's very good of you, but I too have letters to write,"" Ramsey"
1972,"V. ""BOBBY""","replied, and turning coldly on his heel he left Bobby to go out alone."
1973,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1974,"V. ""BOBBY""","Bobby strolled down the Place de la Concorde, but before he reached"
1975,"V. ""BOBBY""",Maxim's his heart misgave him; he was reviewing the events of the evening
1976,"V. ""BOBBY""","and, though he could not justify it, his mind was full of suspicion. It"
1977,"V. ""BOBBY""",was queer her wanting to see Ramsey again after the way he had behaved.
1978,"V. ""BOBBY""",What could have been her object? Was he really so irresistible? She had
1979,"V. ""BOBBY""","certainly shown quite plainly that she wanted to see him, and yet she had"
1980,"V. ""BOBBY""",shown equally plainly that she didn't want him to remain with her alone.
1981,"V. ""BOBBY""","He wondered how long Ramsey would be staying in Paris, and what effect"
1982,"V. ""BOBBY""",his presence would have on his intercourse with Madame de Corantin. Would
1983,"V. ""BOBBY""",he be able to see as much of her or would she drop him in favour of
1984,"V. ""BOBBY""","Ramsey. The thought tortured him, but it wormed its way more and more"
1985,"V. ""BOBBY""",into his brain. Bobby had very little confidence in his powers of
1986,"V. ""BOBBY""",pleasing; it was a common experience of his to be thrown over in favour
1987,"V. ""BOBBY""",of men much less attractive to women than Ramsey. It was true that
1988,"V. ""BOBBY""","hitherto he had not much cared, and when he had been given the ""go-by"" he"
1989,"V. ""BOBBY""","had always reflected that there were as good fish in the sea, and so on;"
1990,"V. ""BOBBY""",but that wasn't the case now.
1991,"V. ""BOBBY""",
1992,"V. ""BOBBY""","Thinking deeply, he had reached the entrance of Maxim's without knowing"
1993,"V. ""BOBBY""","it, but looking in, he turned away in disgust; he had no desire to face"
1994,"V. ""BOBBY""","the crowd inside, he wanted to think things over. He walked on up the"
1995,"V. ""BOBBY""","Boulevard de la Madeleine, and with every step his jealousy increased."
1996,"V. ""BOBBY""",The suspicion rankled; he felt certain that Ramsey would somehow or other
1997,"V. ""BOBBY""","manage to see her again before he could--why, he might even contrive to"
1998,"V. ""BOBBY""",do so that very evening. He knew that Ramsey would dare anything where
1999,"V. ""BOBBY""","women were concerned. Very likely while he was walking up the Boulevard,"
2000,"V. ""BOBBY""",Ramsey was sitting in her room.
2001,"V. ""BOBBY""",
2002,"V. ""BOBBY""","Finally, he could bear it no longer. Turning, he walked swiftly back to"
2003,"V. ""BOBBY""","the hotel; it was a little past eleven, too early to go to bed, too late"
2004,"V. ""BOBBY""",in a darkened and subdued Paris to do anything else. He wondered where
2005,"V. ""BOBBY""","Ramsey was, and, going to the porter, asked him casually if he had seen"
2006,"V. ""BOBBY""",him.
2007,"V. ""BOBBY""",
2008,"V. ""BOBBY""","No, he had not seen Monsieur Ramsey since he had gone upstairs half an"
2009,"V. ""BOBBY""",hour ago; he supposed he had gone to bed.
2010,"V. ""BOBBY""",
2011,"V. ""BOBBY""",Had Ramsey gone to bed? The more Bobby turned it over in his mind the
2012,"V. ""BOBBY""","stronger his suspicions grew, and then came a moment of desperation--he"
2013,"V. ""BOBBY""","must know, he could not bear the suspense. His own room was two floors"
2014,"V. ""BOBBY""",above that on which was Madame de Corantin's apartment. Declining the
2015,"V. ""BOBBY""","lift, he walked slowly upstairs, and as though he were doing so by"
2016,"V. ""BOBBY""","mistake, directed his steps softly past the door of her salon. No one was"
2017,"V. ""BOBBY""","in the corridor, and noiselessly he approached the door. Was that a man's"
2018,"V. ""BOBBY""","voice? Yes, there was not a doubt of it. He listened again, he looked up"
2019,"V. ""BOBBY""","and down the passage, no one was in sight. He placed his head close to"
2020,"V. ""BOBBY""",the woodwork of the door; with a sense of ignominy he realized that if
2021,"V. ""BOBBY""",there had been a keyhole he would have placed his ear to that--anything
2022,"V. ""BOBBY""","to know--anything. Yes, he recognized Ramsey's voice distinctly; he was"
2023,"V. ""BOBBY""",there. On tiptoe he retraced his steps. Arrived at the entrance hall he
2024,"V. ""BOBBY""","flung himself into a chair, a prey to utter wretchedness."

2028,"V. ""BOBBY""",Somehow the night passed.
2029,"V. ""BOBBY""",
2030,"V. ""BOBBY""","Towards morning, perhaps at six or seven, he fell into a heavy sleep,"
2031,"V. ""BOBBY""","completely worn out by his mental sufferings. He awoke late, and,"
2032,"V. ""BOBBY""","glancing at his watch, saw to his horror that it was already eleven"
2033,"V. ""BOBBY""",o'clock. Cursing himself as he realized that this was the hour at which
2034,"V. ""BOBBY""","Madame de Corantin generally went out, he rang the bell. How he longed"
2035,"V. ""BOBBY""","for his trusted valet, enlisted two months back. Now he had only a hotel"
2036,"V. ""BOBBY""",servant to send on messages. When the man arrived he dispatched him
2037,"V. ""BOBBY""",instantly to find out whether Madame de Corantin had sent him any
2038,"V. ""BOBBY""","message, and began to dress hurriedly. The servant did not return, and in"
2039,"V. ""BOBBY""",his impatience Bobby cursed him and rang again. Another servant appeared
2040,"V. ""BOBBY""",and was hurried off on the same errand. In this way twenty minutes
2041,"V. ""BOBBY""",passed; Bobby was dressed and flew downstairs. Unable to disguise his
2042,"V. ""BOBBY""","anxiety, he asked the porter if he had seen Madame de Corantin."
2043,"V. ""BOBBY""",
2044,"V. ""BOBBY""","""Madame de Corantin left an hour ago, Monsieur."""

2075,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2076,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,She gave no address.
2077,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2078,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Bobby read the letter again and again; he could hardly believe his eyes.
2079,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,The worst thing that could possibly happen had befallen him. Where could
2080,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"she have gone, and why couldn't she tell him, and oh, how could he have"
2081,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,been such a fool as to have gone on sleeping like a stupid log at the
2082,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,moment that she was going away? He would never be able to forgive himself
2083,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,for that. Was there any connection between her departure and her meeting
2084,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"with Alistair Ramsey? Bobby tried to concentrate his mind on the problem,"
2085,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,but it baffled him.
2086,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2087,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Completely bewildered, he cross-questioned the hall porter, but he could"
2088,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,add nothing to what he had already said. Madame de Corantin had gone and
2089,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"she had left no address and he had not the slightest idea where, nor did"
2090,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"he know to what station she had gone. A car had come for her, apparently"
2091,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"a private one, she had not ordered it at the hotel. What trains were"
2092,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"there leaving? Oh, there were numbers; there was one to Rouen and Havre"
2093,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"and also to Dieppe about that time, to Bordeaux and San Sebastian, to all"
2094,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,kinds of places. Bobby realized the utter hopelessness of attempting to
2095,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,trace her. Wretchedly the hours passed; in the middle of the afternoon he
2096,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,decided that whatever happened he would not stay another night in Paris.
2097,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"The thought of it sickened him. Paris, the hotel, and everything else had"
2098,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"become hateful. No, he would spend that night at Dieppe, and go to London"
2099,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"the next day, that was all he could think of."
2100,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2101,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Back in London, Bobby's condition of misery, so far from improving,"
2102,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"became worse. His life, aimless enough ever since the War, seemed now"
2103,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,more aimless than ever. Every man he knew had something to do; he alone
2104,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,was objectless and workless. More profoundly than ever he realized all
2105,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,that Madame de Corantin had meant to him. Her disappearance had made his
2106,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"life a blank. Had there been some glimmer of hope, however slight, of"
2107,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"penetrating the mystery, had there been the faintest clue to her present"
2108,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"whereabouts, he would have thrown himself heart and soul into the"
2109,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"endeavour to trace her, but he had absolutely nothing to go upon."
2110,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2111,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Weary and desolate, he haunted restaurants and hotels, in the vague"
2112,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"hope that chance might some day yield him a glimpse of her, as a gambler"
2113,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,clings to a faint prospect of redeeming his fortunes through some
2114,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,wonderful and unexpected revulsion of luck. But the days passed without
2115,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"the slightest encouragement, and his misery turned almost to despair."
2116,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2117,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"At last, at his wits' end to know what to do with himself, he besought"
2118,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,a boon companion of his night life to come to his rescue. To this one war
2119,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,had brought opportunity. His name was Bertram Trent. He had lived all
2120,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"sorts of lives, had been married and divorced, and had made his"
2121,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"appearance more than once in the Bankruptcy Court, but he had knocked"
2122,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,about the world and seen service.
2123,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2124,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Offering himself at the beginning of the War, he had taken part in the"
2125,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Great Retreat and had been wounded. On his recovery he had been given the
2126,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"command of a battalion, and at Bobby's earnest entreaty he promised him a"
2127,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"commission, provided he could get it confirmed at the War Office. This"
2128,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"saved Bobby. He lost no time in putting in his application, and, awaiting"
2129,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"the Gazette, he occupied himself in ordering his kit  and in getting"
2130,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,himself into some sort of physical condition to undertake duties for
2131,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,which his previous life had ill-prepared him. Though considerably past
2132,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"the age for military service, he had not contemplated the possibility of"
2133,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,being refused a commission.
2134,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2135,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Dropping in one day at the Carlton for lunch, he met Harold Clancey, who,"
2136,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"to his surprise, was wearing the Staff cap. Clancey told him that he had"
2137,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"been working for some time at the War Office, and had been given the rank"
2138,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,of captain.
2139,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2140,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Let's have lunch together,"" suggested Bobby."
2141,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2142,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Bobby had met Clancey at all sorts of places, but they had never been on"
2143,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"intimate terms; in fact, the two men had little more than a nodding"
2144,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"acquaintance. Bobby had run into him the last time at Homburg, and"
2145,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Clancey had given him to understand that he had some sort of vague
2146,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,diplomatic appointment. He had drifted across Bobby's life afterwards in
2147,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"a shadowy way, seeming to have nothing special to do, but to know a great"
2148,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,many people and to take life as a sort of a joke. He talked lightly and
2149,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"cynically about serious things, and used foreign expressions with great"
2150,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,ease and fluency. It was characteristic of him that since the War he made
2151,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"frequent use of German idioms, and when conversation turned upon passing"
2152,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"events he professed a complete contempt for English ideas, habits, and"
2153,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"methods, and a great admiration for those of the Germans."
2154,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2155,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""What's your job at the War Office?"" asked Bobby."
2156,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2157,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""As I really don't know myself it is rather difficult to explain it to"
2158,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"you,"" answered the other, ""but it seems chiefly to consist in sitting"
2159,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"tight and preventing other people from annexing it."""
2160,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2161,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I'm up for a commission,"" remarked Bobby. ""Can you do anything to help"
2162,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"me about it?"""
2163,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2164,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Dear me, what a silly thing to do! What regiment?"""
2165,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2166,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Bobby explained.
2167,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2168,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I shall be charmed to do what I can,"" replied Clancey, ""but as they"
2169,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"simply loathe me at Headquarters I don't think it will do you much good."""
2170,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2171,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"They fell to discussing other things. Bobby, obsessed by his recent"
2172,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"experiences, could not resist telling his companion something about them."
2173,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,But he did not mention Ramsey. The implied admission that he had been cut
2174,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,out was too humiliating. Clancey's interest was evidently aroused. He
2175,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,wanted to hear all about Madame de Corantin.
2176,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2177,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""She seems to have fascinated you,"" he remarked."
2178,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2179,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""She'd fascinate anybody."""
2180,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2181,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""And you really don't know what has become of her? How extraordinary!"""
2182,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2183,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Isn't it?"""
2184,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2185,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""You mean to say you cannot trace her in any way?"""
2186,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2187,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I have no more idea than the man in the moon where she is."""
2188,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2189,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Clancey reflected.
2190,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2191,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Did you say she was French?"" he asked."
2192,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2193,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Her husband was; she herself is Russian."""
2194,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2195,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Clancey looked at him.
2196,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2197,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Oh, Russian, is she? Corantin, Corantin. Let me see. I seem to remember"
2198,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"the name somehow."""
2199,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2200,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""No, do you?"" Bobby's voice betrayed his interest."
2201,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2202,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I must think about it,"" said Clancey. He pulled out his watch. ""I think"
2203,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"it is time I got back to the War Office. I'll see about the commission,"
2204,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Froelich, and let you know."""
2205,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2206,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""This is where I live,"" said Bobby, handing him a card. ""Do look me up. I"
2207,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"do want that commission, and as quickly as possible."""
2208,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2209,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"They went out of the restaurant and separated in the street, Bobby taking"
2210,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,his way towards his rooms in Down Street. He was wondering whether
2211,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"perhaps luck had come his way, and whether Clancey would reveal to him"
2212,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"some means of finding Madame de Corantin. If he did, damn the commission!"
2213,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2214,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"That evening, as on all others, Bobby was bored to death; the habits of"
2215,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,twenty years were not to be thrown off in a day. It was impossible for
2216,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"him to go to bed before the small hours, and not knowing how else to kill"
2217,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,time he dropped in at the Savoy restaurant. It was late when he got
2218,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"there, and he strolled through the foyer, stopping at various tables to"
2219,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"talk to acquaintances. He had no intention of taking supper, but just"
2220,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,wanted to see who was there.
2221,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2222,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Of a sudden, for no reason that he could possibly have explained, an"
2223,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,impulse made him walk into the restaurant. In that instant he felt
2224,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"positively, he could have sworn that Madame de Corantin was there. His"
2225,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,heart beat so that he thought it must be heard as he made his way to the
2226,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"entrance, and immediately, with a strange sort of intuition, his eyes"
2227,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,found her.
2228,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2229,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"There she was, at the table on the right. He could see her through the"
2230,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"glass screen, and Ramsey was with her. He stood still a moment, devouring"
2231,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"her with his eyes, and then she looked up and recognized him. Was she"
2232,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,really beckoning to him? The reaction was so great that he dared not
2233,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"believe the evidence of his senses. No, there was no doubt; she was"
2234,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,actually beckoning. As he walked towards the table he felt as though his
2235,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,legs would give way under him; and now he was by her; he held her hand.
2236,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2237,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Ah, Bobby, my friend, I am so pleased to see you."""
2238,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2239,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"The familiar voice, the familiar glance! It was all too good to be true."
2240,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,He was blind to the presence of Ramsey. He was alone with her; Ramsey did
2241,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"not exist; the restaurant did not exist. The hum of voices, the clatter"
2242,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"of plates, the movements of the waiters, were distant sounds: all he knew"
2243,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,was that he was standing there by her.
2244,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2245,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Sit down, Bobby."""
2246,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2247,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Mechanically he seated himself, and gradually some of his equanimity"
2248,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"returned. He could speak, but he said nothing of what he felt."
2249,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Instinctively he knew that it was wiser to make no reference to anything
2250,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,that had passed.
2251,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2252,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Ramsey's face was set and cold, but all his capacity for insolent"
2253,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,indifference did not enable him to conceal his annoyance. His eyes
2254,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,flashed with anger.
2255,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2256,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I think we ought to be going; it is getting rather late. We don't want"
2257,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"to be swept out with the dust, do we?"" He addressed Madame de Corantin."
2258,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2259,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Oh, I am in no hurry, Mr. Ramsey,"" she replied. ""It gives me great"
2260,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,pleasure to see Mr. Froelich again. I was obliged to leave Paris so
2261,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"suddenly, and never had an opportunity of showing him how much I"
2262,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"appreciated his kindness to me."""
2263,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2264,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Ramsey said nothing, but he glared at Bobby vindictively."
2265,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2266,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Presently Madame de Corantin rose, but as she left the room she made a"
2267,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"point of keeping Bobby beside her, and in her inimitable way she asked"
2268,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Ramsey to fetch her cloak. For a moment Bobby had the exquisite joy of
2269,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,being alone with her.
2270,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2271,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Only tell me one thing,"" he almost gasped. ""Tell me that I may see you,"
2272,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"and when."""
2273,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2274,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"She thought a moment. ""Not tomorrow, I fear. I should like to so much,"
2275,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,but I have not a moment. Come the next day to lunch. I am staying at
2276,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Claridge's."""
2277,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2278,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Ramsey appeared with the cloak, and she was gone."
2279,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2280,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,What the next hours meant to Bobby can be imagined. They were passing
2281,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"somehow. The night, the morning, the afternoon wore away. He bought some"
2282,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"magnificent roses and returned to his flat to dress, determined that he"
2283,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"would take them himself to Claridge's, hoping that by some chance he"
2284,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,might catch a glimpse of her.
2285,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2286,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"He was just starting out when, to his surprise, Clancey was announced."
2287,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2288,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""There is something I wanted to tell you, Froelich."""
2289,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2290,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Bobby waited impatiently.
2291,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2292,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""That lady you were talking about, Madame de Corantin. I think I remember"
2293,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"something."""
2294,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2295,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Bobby was nervously anxious to get away. What Clancey had to tell him
2296,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,mattered little now.
2297,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2298,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Oh, thanks very much, Clancey. The fact is, I've seen her."""
2299,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2300,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Clancey's nonchalant manner changed instantaneously.
2301,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2302,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Really!"" he exclaimed."
2303,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2304,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""At the Savoy last night. She is here in London. She is staying at"
2305,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Claridge's. In fact, to tell you the truth, I am taking these flowers"
2306,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,there now. I am to lunch with her to-morrow. It has been a great surprise.
2307,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"I never dreamt of such a thing,"" Bobby stammered on excitedly."
2308,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2309,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Clancey became calm again.
2310,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2311,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Oh, that's most interesting,"" he said. ""You will lunch with her"
2312,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"to-morrow! I say, Froelich, you might introduce me. I could turn up after"
2313,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"lunch, you know."""
2314,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2315,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Bobby's face got serious.
2316,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2317,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Well, I tell you, Clancey, old chap, as a rule I am quite ready to"
2318,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"introduce my friends to any lady I know, but in this particular case it"
2319,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"is not quite the same. You see, the fact is--the last time I introduced a"
2320,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"friend of mine the result was--well, it was not exactly what I bargained"
2321,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"for."""
2322,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2323,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""What do you mean?"" asked Clancey."
2324,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2325,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""What I mean is that I introduced Alistair Ramsey to her in Paris, with"
2326,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"the result that I have never seen her since until yesterday."""
2327,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2328,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Clancey did not immediately reply, but a curious expression overspread"
2329,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"his face. ""Alistair Ramsey,"" he murmured, and then again, ""Alistair"
2330,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Ramsey, dear me!"""
2331,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2332,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Bobby looked at him wonderingly. Clancey laughed lightly.
2333,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2334,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""That reminds me,"" he said. ""I inquired about your commission at the War"
2335,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Office. You know, I suppose, that Alistair Ramsey is private secretary to"
2336,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Sir Archibald Fellowes. Old Fellowes decides upon all commissions,"
2337,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"and your charming friend, Mr. Ramsey, informed him you were not a fit"
2338,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"person to wear his Majesty's uniform."""
2339,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2340,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Bobby stared.
2341,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2342,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""The dirty dog!"" he exclaimed. ""Well, I'm damned! That at the last, after"
2343,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"everything!"""
2344,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2345,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Yes, just that,"" remarked Clancey. ""So you introduced him to Madame de"
2346,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Corantin?"""
2347,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2348,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Not because I wanted to,"" replied Bobby."
2349,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2350,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""And she has been with him ever since?"""
2351,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2352,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Oh, I don't know that."""
2353,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2354,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""But she was with him last night at the Savoy?"""
2355,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2356,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Yes. Damn him! I must be off now. Clancey, really, I'm awfully obliged"
2357,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"to you."""
2358,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2359,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Well, may I come to Claridge's tomorrow? I promise I won't cut you"
2360,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,out--I only want to make her acquaintance. She must be such a charming
2361,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"woman."""
2362,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2363,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""All right. Look in after lunch,"" Bobby answered, and, seizing the huge"
2364,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"parcel which contained his flowers, he led the way out of the room and"
2365,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,thence out of the flat to the cab which was waiting for him.
2366,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2367,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Had Bobby looked out of the window of that cab he would have been
2368,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,surprised. Clancey was running down the street towards Piccadilly as fast
2369,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,as his legs could carry him.
2370,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2371,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,*       *       *       *       *
2372,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2373,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Another shock was in store for poor Bobby. Jumping out of his taxi, he"
2374,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"presented himself to the hall-porter, armed with his huge paper parcel"
2375,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,from the florist.
2376,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2377,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""For Madame de Corantin,"" he said."
2378,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2379,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,The porter looked at him; he knew him well and accepted the offering
2380,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,hesitatingly.
2381,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2382,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""For Madame de Corantin, you said, sir?"""
2383,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2384,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Yes,"" said Bobby."
2385,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2386,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Madame de Corantin left early this afternoon, Mr. Froelich."""
2387,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2388,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,For a moment Bobby was speechless.
2389,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2390,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Left?"" he gasped. ""Are you sure?"""
2391,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2392,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I'm perfectly certain, sir."""
2393,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2394,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""But surely she is coming back again, isn't she? Why, I'm lunching with"
2395,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"her to-morrow."""
2396,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2397,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,The porter looked at him in surprise.
2398,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2399,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Take a seat for a moment, sir, and I'll go and inquire, though to the"
2400,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"best of my belief she took all her luggage with her."""
2401,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2402,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,In a moment the man came back.
2403,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2404,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Yes, sir, she and her maid and all her luggage left about two o'clock."
2405,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"There were two cars; one was brought by a gentleman."""
2406,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2407,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Bobby pulled himself together.
2408,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2409,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Ah! Mr. Alistair Ramsey, I suppose?"" He tried to put indifference into"
2410,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,his voice.
2411,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2412,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Yes, sir, I think it was Mr. Alistair Ramsey."""
2413,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2414,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Bobby walked out of the hotel. ""Oh, damn him, damn him, damn him!"" he"
2415,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,muttered as he threw himself into a cab.
2416,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2417,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Go to Down Street."""
2418,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2419,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Arrived at his rooms, Bobby cast his poor flowers into a corner, and,"
2420,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"flinging himself on to a sofa, buried his face in his hands. What was the"
2421,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"meaning of it, and how could she be so cruel as to play the same trick on"
2422,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,him again? What was the object of telling him to come and see her? It
2423,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,would have been by far kinder to ignore him when she saw him at the
2424,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Savoy. And yet even now Bobby was not resentful. He was bewildered,"
2425,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,but far more was he humiliated at the thought of Ramsey's triumph. There
2426,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,must surely be some explanation. She had greeted him so kindly; she had
2427,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,shown such evident pleasure at seeing him again. Why should she have
2428,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"acted that part? There was no object in it. Something must have happened,"
2429,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,something quite outside the range of ordinary events. As he had done a
2430,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"hundred times, Bobby returned on the past and tried to piece together"
2431,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,consecutively all the incidents since his first meeting with Madame de
2432,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Corantin. Gradually an impression formed itself in his mind that what at
2433,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,first had seemed an attractive mystery was something deeper than he had
2434,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,imagined. Gradually there spread over him a vague sensation of
2435,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"discomfort, of apprehension even. Still, when he thought about her it"
2436,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,seemed impossible to connect anything sinister with a personality so
2437,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"charming, with a disposition so amiable. No, it was beyond him; it"
2438,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,was useless his attempting to puzzle out the problem. Only time could
2439,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"explain it. As they had met at the Savoy, so sooner or later they would"
2440,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,meet again. He knew it was useless to try and forget her; that was
2441,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"impossible, but, in the meantime, what?"
2442,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2443,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Suddenly his reflections were interrupted. Some one was ringing the bell
2444,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,at the entrance. Bobby went to the door. Two men were standing
2445,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,outside--strangers to him.
2446,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2447,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Are you Mr. Froelich?"" one of them asked."
2448,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2449,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Yes,"" answered Bobby. ""Why? What do you want?"""
2450,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2451,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I should like to speak to you a moment."""
2452,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2453,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""What about?"" Bobby eyed them suspiciously."
2454,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2455,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I am from Scotland Yard, Mr. Froelich. We'd better go inside to talk."""
2456,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2457,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Bobby, quite bewildered, led them into his sitting-room, and shut the"
2458,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,door.
2459,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2460,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""My name is Inspector Groombridge,"" said the spokesman of the two. ""I"
2461,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"have been instructed to place you under arrest."""
2462,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2463,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Me! Under arrest? What on earth have I done? There must be some"
2464,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"mistake."""
2465,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2466,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Bobby was horrified.
2467,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2468,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Those are my instructions, Mr. Froelich, and I am afraid I must ask you"
2469,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"to come with me. My colleague, Sub-inspector Dane, is to remain here in"
2470,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"possession, and I am afraid I must ask you to hand him your keys."""
2471,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2472,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""My keys?"" Bobby felt in his pockets. ""What sort of keys do you mean?"" He"
2473,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,pulled a gold chain out of his pocket to which were attached his latchkey
2474,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"and a few others. He held them in his hand, and ticked them off one by"
2475,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"one mechanically. ""This is the key of the cupboard where I keep my cigars"
2476,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,and liqueurs; this is the key of my dispatch-box. I don't think I've got
2477,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"anything else locked up."""
2478,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2479,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Have you no safe, no desk or other receptacle where you keep your"
2480,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"papers, Mr. Froelich--documents of any kind?"""
2481,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2482,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Papers--documents?"" ejaculated Bobby. ""No, I haven't got any documents"
2483,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"or papers. What do you mean?"""
2484,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2485,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Well, I'm afraid it will be the duty of Sub-inspector Dane to search"
2486,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"your apartment, Mr. Froelich, and I want to save you from having anything"
2487,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"broken open if it can be avoided."""
2488,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2489,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""There is nothing to break open. I don't lock anything up except cigars"
2490,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"and things of that kind, and as to my dispatch-box, there's not much"
2491,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,there either. I hardly know what there is--I haven't looked inside it for
2492,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"ever so long. There may be a few private letters."""
2493,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2494,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""What sort of letters?"" asked the inspector."
2495,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2496,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,To Bobby this sounded menacing.
2497,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2498,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Oh, I don't know; perhaps there may be one or two--well, what shall I"
2499,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"call them?--love letters, I suppose. Anyhow, here are the keys."" He"
2500,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,handed them over to the other man as he spoke.
2501,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2502,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Call a cab."" The inspector spoke to his subordinate."
2503,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2504,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I say,"" asked Bobby apprehensively, ""am I going to be locked up?"""
2505,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2506,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,The inspector hesitated slightly. Bobby's innocence seemed to strike him.
2507,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,He was not the sort of person he was used to arresting.
2508,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2509,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I am afraid it's more than likely, Mr. Froelich."""
2510,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2511,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Can't I change my clothes?"" queried Bobby. ""You see, I've got on evening"
2512,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"dress, and I suppose I shan't have a chance of getting out of it."""
2513,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2514,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,The inspector reflected a moment.
2515,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2516,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Oh yes, Mr. Froelich. I don't see why you should not change, but I'm"
2517,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"afraid I must ask you to let me accompany you."""
2518,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2519,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Well, I'm--D'you think I'm going to try and escape?"""
2520,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2521,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Oh, I don't say that, Mr. Froelich, but sometimes things happen on these"
2522,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"occasions, and it's my duty to be on the safe side. I'm sorry to"
2523,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"inconvenience you."""
2524,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2525,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Come on in, then."" Bobby led the way into his dressing-room, and in a"
2526,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,few minutes he was rolling off with his strange companion to some
2527,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,destination unknown.
2528,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2529,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,After the most uncomfortable night Bobby had ever spent in his life he
2530,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,was escorted next morning by Sub-inspector Dane to Scotland Yard. He was
2531,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"ushered into a waiting-room, and there he sat with the inspector, waiting"
2532,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,until he should be summoned before the Assistant Commissioner. Had he
2533,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"been able to see what was going on in the adjoining room, he would have"
2534,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,been exceedingly surprised.
2535,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2536,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"The Assistant Commissioner, one of those public servants whose quiet,"
2537,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"unobtrusive manner covers a strong character and a great efficiency, was"
2538,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,sitting at his table talking to Harold Clancey. They were in earnest
2539,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,consultation.
2540,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2541,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Then I understand, Captain Clancey,"" said the Assistant Commissioner,"
2542,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""that this lady has got clear off?"""
2543,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2544,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Clancey smiled serenely.
2545,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2546,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Oh, rather! Address: Hôtel des Indes, The Hague--quite a comfortable"
2547,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"place and quite an important German espionage centre."""
2548,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2549,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I gather that our man was too late."""
2550,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2551,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""By some hours, I should say,"" Clancey replied. ""You see, we only got the"
2552,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,report in from France quite late. I sent your man to watch her while I
2553,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"went to see Froelich. I was sure he was all right, but I wanted to"
2554,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,satisfy myself. By the time I reached our place I found the chief in the
2555,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"deuce of a stew. Your man had got back, and reported that she'd gone."
2556,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"They'd kicked up the devil's delight at Headquarters, and the chief was"
2557,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"out for blood. He was determined to arrest somebody, and I suggested"
2558,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Ramsey, but he got purple in the face and told me he'd instructed your"
2559,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"people to bag Froelich. I thought this quite idiotic, but it relieved"
2560,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"the chief's feelings, and it was too late to do anything sensible. We"
2561,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"knew the ship she took; of course, she was much too clever to sail under"
2562,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"the English flag. Naturally we wirelessed, but they won't dare touch her."
2563,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"After that last row it's hands off these Dutchmen."""
2564,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2565,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""And the view of your department, Captain Clancey, is that it's useless"
2566,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"for us to detain Mr. Froelich?"""
2567,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2568,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Absolutely useless. I can swear to it. As I told you, I don't know him"
2569,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"well, but I know all about him, and I am satisfied of his complete"
2570,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"innocence, and that he is entirely unaware of Madame de Corantin's"
2571,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"objects and activities."""
2572,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2573,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Then what do you propose that we should do, Captain Clancey?"""
2574,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2575,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I propose nothing at all, Mr. Crane."""
2576,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2577,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""What, after her getting those passports?"""
2578,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2579,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Clancey twisted his moustache.
2580,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2581,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""That's a matter which concerns spheres altogether over my head, Mr."
2582,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Crane."""
2583,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2584,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""But Mr. Ramsey says that it's entirely owing to Mr. Froelich's"
2585,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"introduction that he provided the lady with passports, that he'd known"
2586,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"her through him, and having been a friend of Mr. Froelich for many years,"
2587,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,he had implicitly trusted him. He was here only a few minutes before you
2588,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"came, and he told me that there was no doubt at all but that he had been"
2589,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,the victim of a conspiracy between Froelich and this Madame de Corantin.
2590,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"He admitted that he ought to have been on his guard, considering that Mr."
2591,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Froelich's name was German, and of course it was natural that he would"
2592,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"have German sympathies."""
2593,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2594,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Um! And what do you think, Mr. Crane?"""
2595,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2596,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,The Assistant Commissioner was silent for a moment.
2597,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2598,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""You see, I don't know Mr. Froelich,"" he said."
2599,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2600,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""But you do know Mr. Ramsey,"" replied Clancey."
2601,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2602,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""Not well."""
2603,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2604,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""What about his chief? You know him well enough. Why not ask him?"""
2605,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2606,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,The Assistant Commissioner's answer was to throw a note across the table
2607,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,to his questioner. It ran as follows--

2623,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2624,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,Clancey whistled.
2625,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2626,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"""That looks rather awkward for Master Alistair."""
2627,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2628,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,There was a knock on the door. It was Inspector Groombridge.
2629,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2630,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"""Excuse me, sir, my man has just brought this. It was delivered by a"
2631,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,stranger to the hall-porter of the building where Mr. Froelich occupies a
2632,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"flat."" He handed a letter to the Assistant Commissioner, who read it"
2633,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"slowly and without comment passed it to Clancey. Clancey, read it"
2634,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"through, smiled, and passed it back."
2635,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2636,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"""I think that settles it,"" he remarked, ""and with your kind permission I"
2637,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"will now depart."""
2638,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2639,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"Nodding farewell to the Assistant Commissioner, Clancey withdrew by the"
2640,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,private exit opposite to the one which led into the room where Bobby was
2641,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,miserably awaiting his fate.
2642,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2643,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"""Show Mr. Froelich in, Inspector Groombridge, and, by the way, I hope you"
2644,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"have treated him with courtesy."""
2645,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2646,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,The inspector cleared his throat.
2647,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2648,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"""Oh, I think so, sir. Of course, it's rather difficult in these cases to"
2649,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"make a gentleman comfortable, but I gave him a shake-down in my own"
2650,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,private room for the night and sent a man for his toilet things and so on
2651,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"in the morning."""
2652,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2653,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"""Very well, Inspector; show him in at once."""
2654,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2655,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,Bobby came into the room; his expression was more bewildered than
2656,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"apprehensive. The Assistant Commissioner held out his hand, which Bobby"
2657,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,took with a look of surprise.
2658,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2659,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"""Do sit down, Mr. Froelich. I am so sorry to have troubled you. You will,"
2660,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"I am sure, understand that in times like these one has to be very"
2661,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"careful, and your acquaintance with Madame de Corantin--"""
2662,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2663,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"""Madame de Corantin!"" Bobby, exclaimed. ""What in the world--"""
2664,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2665,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"""One moment, Mr. Froelich. I'll try and explain it to you. Madame de"
2666,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,Corantin is known to us. She is a very clever emissary of the German
2667,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"Government, and she has succeeded in baffling us entirely up till now"
2668,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,because by a chain of coincidences there has been no one who could
2669,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,identify her on the various occasions that she has been in England.
2670,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"Thanks to her influential connections, she has succeeded in obtaining"
2671,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"information of considerable value, and has also been enabled to elude"
2672,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,both the French authorities and ourselves. We have reason to believe that
2673,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,she has secured travelling facilities and passports through her relations
2674,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"with high Government officials, both French and English, whom she knew"
2675,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"before the War. You will understand, therefore, that your acquaintance"
2676,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,with her was at first sight a suspicious circumstance. I am glad to be
2677,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"able to tell you, however, that on inquiry we find that you are entirely"
2678,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"innocent of any complicity with her plans, and this result of our"
2679,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,investigations is confirmed by a letter which she apparently addressed
2680,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"to you."""
2681,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2682,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,Bobby's face had been growing longer and longer as the Assistant
2683,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,Commissioner proceeded. When Mr. Crane mentioned the letter Bobby could
2684,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,not restrain an exclamation.
2685,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2686,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"""A letter?"" he asked excitedly. ""What letter?"""
2687,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2688,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,"""This,"" said the Assistant Commissioner, handing him the note that"
2689,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,Clancey and he had previously seen.
2690,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2691,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,Bobby took it eagerly and read--
2692,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2693,ARCHIBALD FELLOWES.,
2694,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--","DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--"
2695,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",
2696,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",Once more I fear I am causing you unhappiness. I cannot explain
2697,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--","everything, but I can at least tell you this. When I prevailed upon you"
2698,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--","to introduce Mr. Ramsey to me, so much against your will, I had an"
2699,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",object. This object was very far from being a desire for Mr. Ramsey's
2700,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--","acquaintance as you supposed, for I am still, and always shall be,"
2701,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--","devoted to that former friend of whom I told you. His name, I may now"
2702,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--","tell you, is Prince von Waldheim und Schlangenfurst. When I came to"
2703,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--","London I had hoped to have remained long enough to see you again, but I"
2704,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",had no alternative but to go at a moment's notice. To have remained would
2705,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",have been dangerous.
2706,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",
2707,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",This letter will be delivered to you by a person whom I can trust. By the
2708,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",time you get it I shall be in Holland.
2709,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",
2710,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--","Some day when peace is restored I hope we may meet, and it will give me"
2711,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--","great pleasure to see you and introduce you to Prince von Waldheim, who"
2712,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",esteems loyalty as I do.
2713,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",
2714,"DEAR BOBBY, MY FRIEND,--",As to Mr. Ramsey I do not know which I despise most--his vanity or his

2724,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2725,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2726,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,As Bobby finished the letter he looked up and met the eyes of the
2727,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,Assistant Commissioner who rose from his chair.
2728,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2729,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"""I need not detain you, Mr. Froelich; it only remains for me to apologize"
2730,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,for any trouble I may have given you. I must ask you to be kind enough to
2731,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"lend me this letter, which, however, I shall send on to you in a few"
2732,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"days."""
2733,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,
2734,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"Bobby returned to his flat, relieved but chastened. It was not long"
2735,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,before he received the commission he coveted. The same Gazette contained
2736,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,two announcements: one that a commission as lieutenant had been granted
2737,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,"to Mr. J. Froelich, the other that his Majesty had no further use for the"
2738,FRANCINE DE CORANTIN.,services of Mr. Alistair Ramsey.

2743,VI. A WAR VICTIM,VI. A WAR VICTIM
2744,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2745,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"Gilbert Baxendale is at fifty what people call ""a nice-looking man."" He"
2746,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"hardly seems any older than he did ten years ago, except that he is"
2747,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"rather stouter below the belt, and that when he takes off his hat one"
2748,VI. A WAR VICTIM,notices that he is getting a little bald. His skin is pink and
2749,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"unwrinkled, and his hair and moustache are so light that one does not"
2750,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"notice whether they are turning grey or not, and he looks as spruce as"
2751,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"ever. Baxendale always has been particular about his appearance, and"
2752,VI. A WAR VICTIM,he is never so pleased as when you ask him the name of his tailor. But
2753,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"his reply in that case is deprecating, implying that he doesn't think"
2754,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"very much of him, do you? which is intended to draw further reassurance"
2755,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"and compliment. On the other hand, if, inspired by the lustre of their"
2756,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"beautiful polish, you should inquire where he gets his boots, his"
2757,VI. A WAR VICTIM,expression changes. Although boots are about as near a hobby as he has
2758,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"ever got, he is distressed about the shape of his feet, and says that his"
2759,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"corns give him a lot of trouble. But he likes to talk about boots, and a"
2760,VI. A WAR VICTIM,recurring subject of conversation with him is the difficulty of finding a
2761,VI. A WAR VICTIM,man who really understands doing them properly. He knows a great deal
2762,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"about blacking and brushes, and is no mean authority on the art of boning"
2763,VI. A WAR VICTIM,or polishing or varnishing refractory footgear of all kinds. To look at
2764,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"him one would think Baxendale has never had a day's illness in his life,"
2765,VI. A WAR VICTIM,but as a matter of fact he has never been well since any one can
2766,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"remember. He has always suffered from what one may call ailments, and"
2767,VI. A WAR VICTIM,when one saw him at the club or in Bond Street he would tell you he was
2768,VI. A WAR VICTIM,not quite the thing--he was run down or had lumbago or a bit of a chill
2769,VI. A WAR VICTIM,on the liver.
2770,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2771,VI. A WAR VICTIM,Baxendale is very particular about cooking. He used to complain a good
2772,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"deal about the food at the club, but after his marriage he said it had"
2773,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"improved, which no one could understand, as the kitchen staff has not"
2774,VI. A WAR VICTIM,been changed for twenty years. Freddy Catchpole said that once when he
2775,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"dined with them Mrs. Baxendale asked him about the club cook, because"
2776,VI. A WAR VICTIM,Gilbert was very dissatisfied with theirs. Servants worried Baxendale
2777,VI. A WAR VICTIM,a great deal after he got married. He said they almost made him long for
2778,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"his bachelor days, when he did not know what domestic cares were."
2779,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2780,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"The Baxendales live in one of those new, well-built houses in the"
2781,VI. A WAR VICTIM,neighbourhood of Grosvenor Square. It was some time before Baxendale
2782,VI. A WAR VICTIM,could make up his mind to buy the lease of it. For a year or two he tried
2783,VI. A WAR VICTIM,taking furnished houses alternately in the country and in town. Being a
2784,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"cautious man, he wanted to give both a good trial, but his wife finally"
2785,VI. A WAR VICTIM,made up his mind for him. She took no end of trouble in decorating and
2786,VI. A WAR VICTIM,furnishing their house in some antique style. At first Baxendale seemed
2787,VI. A WAR VICTIM,to be pleased. Every now and then he told men at the club how clever she
2788,VI. A WAR VICTIM,was at picking up bargains; but after a time he got gloomy when one asked
2789,VI. A WAR VICTIM,how the house was getting on. He said he had met a man who had made a
2790,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"collection of antiques, and when he wanted to sell them he found they"
2791,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"were all shams, and it nearly ruined him."
2792,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2793,VI. A WAR VICTIM,After it was all finished the Baxendales gave a house-warming party.
2794,VI. A WAR VICTIM,Peter Knott said afterwards that Baxendale took him aside and confided to
2795,VI. A WAR VICTIM,him that he wasn't at all pleased with the house. It faced west instead
2796,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"of south, and the drawing-room was so large one could never buy enough"
2797,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"furniture to put in it, whereas his smoking-room was a rotten little hole"
2798,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"you couldn't swing a cat in. Besides, it really was a mistake living in"
2799,VI. A WAR VICTIM,town; the country was much better for the health and less expensive on
2800,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"the whole, even if you had shooting and entertained a good deal. He had"
2801,VI. A WAR VICTIM,a great mind to sell the lease if he could get a good offer. Then he
2802,VI. A WAR VICTIM,would have a flat just to run up to when he wanted to stay in town for a
2803,VI. A WAR VICTIM,week at a time and do the theatres.
2804,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2805,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"The Baxendales have no children, and apparently no nephews, nieces, nor"
2806,VI. A WAR VICTIM,other youthful belongings in whom they take any special interest. One day
2807,VI. A WAR VICTIM,Peter Knott met Baxendale playing golf with a young man whom he
2808,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"introduced to him as his nephew, Dick Barnard, but the youth did not"
2809,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"reappear on any other occasion, and Peter remembers that Baxendale told"
2810,VI. A WAR VICTIM,him in confidence that the boy put on side and was cheeky.
2811,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2812,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"Baxendale always tells things in confidence to people, and occasionally"
2813,VI. A WAR VICTIM,they happen to meet and compare notes; in this way they sometimes get to
2814,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"know what Baxendale thinks about them, and this does not add to his"
2815,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"popularity. Baxendale retired from business after his marriage, and"
2816,VI. A WAR VICTIM,invested his capital as remuneratively as security permitted. He came to
2817,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"the conclusion that as his wife's income, added to his own, provided all"
2818,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"the money they needed, there was no object in boring himself by going to"
2819,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"the City. After he gave up business, every week when in town Baxendale"
2820,VI. A WAR VICTIM,had certain obligations which filled up his time agreeably for him. For
2821,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"instance, he looked over the share list every morning to see that his and"
2822,VI. A WAR VICTIM,Mrs. Baxendale's investments were all right. He liked a pleasant object
2823,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"for a walk, so at least once a week he made a point of fetching his"
2824,VI. A WAR VICTIM,passbook from the bank. One day Freddy Catchpole met him just as he was
2825,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"coming out, and he said he was awfully upset about his quarter's balance,"
2826,VI. A WAR VICTIM,which had never been so low before. Freddy told him he had never had a
2827,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"balance at the end of a quarter in his life, and Baxendale replied that,"
2828,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"at all events, that saved him anxiety about investing it."
2829,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2830,VI. A WAR VICTIM,There used to be lots of other ways in which Baxendale passed his time.
2831,VI. A WAR VICTIM,There was always something or other to order at his tailor's or his
2832,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"shirtmaker's. He was never extravagant in these matters, but when he"
2833,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"decided to get something he took time and trouble over it, and would go"
2834,VI. A WAR VICTIM,several times to try things on. He used to say that in this way he got
2835,VI. A WAR VICTIM,quite a lot of exercise. On Saturdays and Sundays he and his wife
2836,VI. A WAR VICTIM,sometimes motored down to play golf at one or the other of their clubs.
2837,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"Baxendale said since his marriage he was off his game, and it was really"
2838,VI. A WAR VICTIM,no fun playing with a woman. Mrs. Baxendale asked Peter Knott's advice
2839,VI. A WAR VICTIM,about it. She said it was such a pity Gilbert lost his temper and never
2840,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"would finish the round when she was one up, as the exercise really was"
2841,VI. A WAR VICTIM,good for him. During the racing season Baxendale generally managed to
2842,VI. A WAR VICTIM,avoid golf and go down to Sandown or Kempton or Gatwick instead; he said
2843,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"he got just as much air and exercise there, and there was always a chance"
2844,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"of paying your expenses. Sometimes he succeeded, as he was very careful;"
2845,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"but whenever he failed he would say he'd chuck it up altogether, the game"
2846,VI. A WAR VICTIM,wasn't worth the candle.
2847,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2848,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"In the winter Baxendale used at one time to take a shoot near London, but"
2849,VI. A WAR VICTIM,he gave it up because he got bored with looking after it and arranging
2850,VI. A WAR VICTIM,parties. He said he was sick of being sponged on by men who never asked
2851,VI. A WAR VICTIM,him back.
2852,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2853,VI. A WAR VICTIM,He complained a good deal about the snobbishness of people generally.
2854,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"Somebody was always cutting or ignoring him, and then ""look at the sort"
2855,VI. A WAR VICTIM,of men that one meets nowadays; fellows whose fathers keep shops and
2856,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"haven't an 'h' in their alphabets."" He couldn't understand how people"
2857,VI. A WAR VICTIM,could stand the cads that went about; yet you could go into the Ritz
2858,VI. A WAR VICTIM,or the Carlton and see the Countess of Daventry and Lady FitzStuart
2859,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"lunching and dining with ""bounders like that fellow Clutterbuck."""
2860,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2861,VI. A WAR VICTIM,After his marriage Baxendale became absorbed more and more by his wife's
2862,VI. A WAR VICTIM,family. He seemed to be impressed especially by old Sir Robert and Jack
2863,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"Barnard, his wife's uncle and brother. Whatever Jack did interested"
2864,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"Baxendale, and whatever he said Baxendale repeated in confidence to most"
2865,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"of his acquaintances. Of course Jack is a romancer, but Baxendale never"
2866,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"knows whether to believe him or not, and Jack, being aware of this,"
2867,VI. A WAR VICTIM,concocts imposing fairy tales for Baxendale's benefit. Sir Robert is
2868,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"supposed to be very rich, and the amount of his fortune and what he is"
2869,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"going to do with it are matters of deep concern to Baxendale, who made a"
2870,VI. A WAR VICTIM,habit of calling on him daily and constantly inviting him to dinner. He
2871,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"told Peter Knott he was sorry for the old man being so lonely, and that"
2872,VI. A WAR VICTIM,his wife was his favourite niece and much attached to him; but Jack
2873,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"declared that his uncle was horribly mean, and only tolerated Baxendale"
2874,VI. A WAR VICTIM,because he could get dinner at his house for nothing.
2875,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2876,VI. A WAR VICTIM,At the beginning of the War Baxendale began complaining about his nerves.
2877,VI. A WAR VICTIM,Somehow he didn't enjoy his food and couldn't get a proper night's sleep.
2878,VI. A WAR VICTIM,He'd tried Benger's Food last thing at night and Quaker Oats for
2879,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"breakfast, but nothing seemed to do him any good."
2880,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2881,VI. A WAR VICTIM,The curious part of Baxendale's illness was that he continued to look
2882,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"perfectly well, but he seemed to get offended if people said so; what"
2883,VI. A WAR VICTIM,really touched him was pity. There's a man at the club called Funkelstein
2884,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"whom everybody supposed was a German, but now he says he's Dutch. Just"
2885,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"after the War broke out, Baxendale told every one confidentially he was a"
2886,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"spy, but, to our surprise, they suddenly became quite friendly. It seemed"
2887,VI. A WAR VICTIM,that Funkelstein also suffered from nerves. Baxendale said he was most
2888,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"sympathetic to him personally, and alluded to him as ""poor Funkelstein."""
2889,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"As time went on Baxendale's nerves grew worse, and it was thought he must"
2890,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"have been badly hit financially by the War, till Peter Knott told us that"
2891,VI. A WAR VICTIM,he had invested most of his wife's and his own money in shipping
2892,VI. A WAR VICTIM,companies and coal-mine debentures which had done nothing but rise ever
2893,VI. A WAR VICTIM,since the War began. On the strength of this satisfactory information
2894,VI. A WAR VICTIM,Baxendale was occasionally approached for subscriptions; but his response
2895,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"was generally evasive, or the amount offered so minute that he felt"
2896,VI. A WAR VICTIM,compelled to explain it by expressing his apprehensions about new
2897,VI. A WAR VICTIM,taxation and the insane extravagance of the Government.
2898,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2899,VI. A WAR VICTIM,After a time Baxendale told us he could hardly bear to open a paper; he
2900,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"never knew what he might read next, and he felt he could not stand any"
2901,VI. A WAR VICTIM,more shocks. That made us suppose he had a brother or some near relative
2902,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"at the Front, and for some days we were rather apologetic in our attitude"
2903,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"towards him, as, what with the War and our own anxieties, we had shown"
2904,VI. A WAR VICTIM,some indifference to Baxendale's nerves.
2905,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2906,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"But one day Jack Barnard turned up as a major in khaki, and said"
2907,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"something so rude to his brother-in-law, who was sitting in the corner"
2908,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"with Funkelstein, that the latter turned pale and left the room"
2909,VI. A WAR VICTIM,hurriedly. It appeared afterwards that Jack had got his back up against
2910,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"""that blighter Gilbert"" because he hadn't done a thing for Dick, who had"
2911,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"been at Sandhurst, and was now with his regiment in France. ""It wasn't as"
2912,VI. A WAR VICTIM,though the selfish swine had kids of his own or some one else's whom he
2913,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"cared about. Not a soul. Sickening, I call it. He didn't even say"
2914,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"good-bye to him or ask after him."""
2915,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2916,VI. A WAR VICTIM,*       *       *       *       *
2917,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2918,VI. A WAR VICTIM,Later on Baxendale developed a habit of questioning every one as to what
2919,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"they were doing. On one occasion he asked Postlethwaite, who runs a"
2920,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"convalescent home at Margate, if there was anything he could do down"
2921,VI. A WAR VICTIM,there. Postlethwaite suggested that he might drive wounded soldiers down
2922,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"to Margate in his car if he liked. Baxendale said he'd think it over, but"
2923,VI. A WAR VICTIM,when Postlethwaite had gone he asked Peter Knott in confidence if he
2924,VI. A WAR VICTIM,didn't think it was taking advantage of people to mess up their cars like
2925,VI. A WAR VICTIM,that.
2926,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2927,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"Another time he tackled old Colonel Bridge, who had been up all night"
2928,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"doing special constable duty, and was not in the sweetest of tempers."
2929,VI. A WAR VICTIM,When Baxendale asked him what he was doing he told him he'd better come
2930,VI. A WAR VICTIM,round to the police-station at three the next morning and see for
2931,VI. A WAR VICTIM,himself.
2932,VI. A WAR VICTIM,
2933,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"Baxendale has not turned up at the club since, and we were all hoping he"
2934,VI. A WAR VICTIM,had found suitable employment. This happens to nearly every one sooner or
2935,VI. A WAR VICTIM,later except to us seniors. But it had not happened to Baxendale; for
2936,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"Freddy Catchpole, who has managed to get a job at the War Office, dined"
2937,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"one evening with Mrs. Baxendale, and she told him poor Gilbert had got so"
2938,VI. A WAR VICTIM,bad with his nerves that he had to go to a nursing-home in the country to
2939,VI. A WAR VICTIM,"take a cure. And there, for all I know, he will stay till the War is"
2940,VI. A WAR VICTIM,over.

2946,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
2947,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,David Saunderson lived on the top floor of one of the few lofty buildings
2948,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"in Chelsea, and as his years increased, the ascent of the five flights of"
2949,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"stairs became a serious matter. His heart was none too sound, and the"
2950,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,three minutes he once needed to reach his attic from the ground floor had
2951,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,already become five when the War began.
2952,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
2953,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,With the first shock of battles the emaciated remains of his bedridden
2954,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,brother were borne down the steep stairs and out of the little flat he
2955,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,had not left for the last five years of his life.
2956,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
2957,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,The two had lived together since Philip had returned from India as a man
2958,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"of fifty, with the reasonable hope of enjoying his pensioned retirement."
2959,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"Philip had spent his energy freely in the Indian Civil Service, and the"
2960,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"two middle-aged brothers, either too poor to marry, too shy, or both,"
2961,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,determined to combine resources with companionship and keep house
2962,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,together.
2963,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
2964,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,For a time they sailed contentedly downstream. Philip's public spirit and
2965,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"industrious habits would not permit of what he called ""a life of indolent"
2966,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"ease."" He rose early and put in a good eight hours' day at various unpaid"
2967,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"labours. He became churchwarden of the parish, joined the vestry, and was"
2968,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,a much valued unit of that obscure element in the population which does a
2969,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,great part of the public work for which individuals of a less modest type
2970,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,get the recognition.
2971,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
2972,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,David earned his living as a journalist and literary hack. He had never
2973,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"done or been anything else in his life, although to his small circle he"
2974,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"loved, in a guileless way, to convey the impression that his youthful"
2975,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,performances had been of no little brilliance.
2976,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
2977,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,He would mention the names of the celebrated editors by whom he had been
2978,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"employed as literary or dramatic critic, and was never tired of"
2979,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,eulogizing these and other lettered heroes for whom he had slaved in the
2980,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,distant past. He insisted on the appreciation that these forgotten lions
2981,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"had shown of his work; but, however that might be, its manifestation had"
2982,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"certainly never been translated into terms of cash, for within no one's"
2983,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,memory had David's pecuniary resources been other than exiguous.
2984,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
2985,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"He was a great lover of the Arts, but his tastes were catholic and he"
2986,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,worshipped at many shrines. He had no great patience with those who
2987,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"admire the modern to the exclusion of the old, or whose allegiance to one"
2988,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,school precludes acceptance of another. He held his arms wide open and
2989,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,embraced Art in all its manifestations.
2990,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
2991,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,He was a great hero-worshipper; there was no sort of achievement he did
2992,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"not admire, but he had his special favourites; generally these were"
2993,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,successful playwrights or novelists whose work he revised for publication
2994,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"at a minimum rate and whose additional recognition, in the form of a back"
2995,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"seat for a first night or a signed presentation copy, produced in him a"
2996,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,quite inordinate gratitude.
2997,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
2998,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,David Saunderson was the embodiment of ponderousness; he spoke as slowly
2999,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,as he moved his cumbersome limbs. So gradual were his mental processes
3000,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"that his friends forbore to ask him questions, knowing that they would"
3001,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,not have time to wait for his replies. For these reasons the agile in
3002,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"body and mind avoided encounters with him, but if he chanced to meet them"
3003,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,where there was no escape they would evade him by cunning or invent
3004,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,transparent excuses which only one so artless as he would have believed.
3005,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3006,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,Now and then he paid visits to old friends who were sometimes caught
3007,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"unawares. Then he would settle his huge bulk in an arm-chair, and his"
3008,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"head, bald except for a fringe of grey hair about the ears, seemed to"
3009,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"sink into his chest, upon which the bearded chin reposed as though the"
3010,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,whole affair were too heavy to support. At such times he gave one the
3011,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,impression of a massive fixture which could be about as easily moved as a
3012,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"grand piano, and his hosts would resign themselves to their fate."
3013,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3014,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"If any one had the temerity to provoke him to discussion, he would wait"
3015,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"patiently for an opening, and once he secured it, would maintain his"
3016,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"opinion steadily, the even, dispassionate voice slowly wearing down all"
3017,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,opposition.
3018,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3019,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,He was not without humour and a certain shrewdness in judging men and
3020,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"things, and would smile tolerantly when views were advanced with which he"
3021,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"disagreed. It was not difficult to make merry at his expense, for he"
3022,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"suspected no one, and only those who spoke ill of their neighbours"
3023,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,disturbed his equanimity. Towards cynics his attitude was compassionate.
3024,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3025,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,Directly war broke out David enrolled himself in the special volunteer
3026,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,corps of artists raised by an eminent Academician. He took his duties
3027,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"very seriously, and was at great pains to master the intricacies of"
3028,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"squad-drill. He never admitted that some of the exercises, especially the"
3029,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,one that consists in lying on the ground face downwards and raising
3030,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"yourself several times in succession by your arms, were trying to a man"
3031,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"of his weight and proportions, but about the time he was beginning to"
3032,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,pride himself on his military proficiency Philip's death occurred. He
3033,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,said little about it and quietly occupied himself with the funeral and
3034,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"with settling his dead brother's small affairs, but the battalion were"
3035,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,little surprised when shortly afterwards his resignation followed on
3036,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,medical grounds.
3037,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3038,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"The Saundersons were connected with a family of some distinction, the"
3039,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"head of which, knowing that Philip's pension died with him and that"
3040,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"David's earnings were smaller than ever since the War, would gladly have"
3041,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,offered him some pecuniary assistance. But David's pride equalled his
3042,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"modesty, and Peter Knott had to be charged with the mission of"
3043,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,approaching him.
3044,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3045,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,One afternoon Peter found David in his attic going through his dead
3046,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,brother's papers and smoking a pipe. Peter knew his man too well to
3047,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,attempt direct interrogation. He felt his way by inquiries as to the
3048,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"general situation of Art, and David was soon enlarging on the merits"
3049,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,of sundry unknown but gifted painters and craftsmen whose work he hoped
3050,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,Peter might bring to the notice of his wealthy friends.
3051,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3052,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"""The poor fellows are starving, Knott,"" he said in his leisurely way as"
3053,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,he raised himself painfully from his chair and walked heavily to a corner
3054,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,where lay a portfolio.
3055,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3056,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,Every piece of furniture in the small sitting-room was littered with a
3057,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,heterogeneous collection of manuscripts and books; the latter were piled
3058,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,up everywhere. David slowly removed some from a table and laid the folio
3059,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,upon it.
3060,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3061,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"""Now, here's--a charming--etching."" He had a way of saying a word or two"
3062,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"and then pausing as though to take breath, which demanded great patience"
3063,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,of a listener.
3064,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3065,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"Peter stood by him and examined it, David meanwhile puffing at his pipe."
3066,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3067,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"""The man--who did that--is one of our best line engravers--his name is"
3068,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"Macmanus--he's dreadfully hard up--look at this."""
3069,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3070,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,He held another before his visitor.
3071,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3072,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"""That's by Plimsoll--a silver point--isn't it a beautiful thing?"""
3073,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3074,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"""Delightful,"" replied Peter."
3075,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3076,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"""Well, do you know--Knott--that--"" David's pipe had gone out. He moved"
3077,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"slowly towards his chair and began looking for the matches. ""Do you know,"
3078,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"Plimsoll is one of the most gifted""--he was holding a match to his pipe"
3079,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"as he spoke--""gifted young artists in the country--and two days"
3080,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"ago--he--was literally hungry--"" David took his pipe from his mouth and"
3081,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,looked at Peter to see the effect of his words.
3082,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3083,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"""It's very sad, very""--Peter Knott's tone was sympathetic--""but after"
3084,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"all, they're young; they could enlist, couldn't they?"""
3085,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3086,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,David sat down in his chair and pulled at his pipe reflectively before
3087,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,answering.
3088,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3089,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"""They're--neither of them--strong, Knott. They'd--be laid up in a week."""
3090,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3091,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"""Um--hard luck that,"" Peter Knott agreed. ""But what's to be done?"
3092,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"Everybody's in the same boat. The writers now, I wager they're just as"
3093,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"badly hit, aren't they?"""
3094,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3095,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"""That depends--"" David paused, and Peter gave him time to finish his"
3096,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"sentence. ""The occasional--er--contributors--are having a bad time--but"
3097,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,the regular journalists--the people on the staffs--are all right--of

3099,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"letter from him somewhere--Wyatt's his name--now, he's--"" David's huge"
3100,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,body began to rise again gradually. Peter Knott stopped him.
3101,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,
3102,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"""By the way,"" he remarked briskly, ""I saw your friend Seaford yesterday."""

3201,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,In due course Peter Knott reported the result of his visit to Sir Herbert
3202,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"Saunderson. The latter, a kindly man with an income barely enough for the"
3203,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,"responsibilities a large family entailed on him, took counsel with his"
3204,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,old friend as to what could be done next. There was reason for believing
3205,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,that David's stolid silence regarding his own concerns concealed a
3206,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,general impecuniousness quite as pronounced as that of the artist friends
3207,VII. DULCE ET DECORUM,whose cause he pleaded.
