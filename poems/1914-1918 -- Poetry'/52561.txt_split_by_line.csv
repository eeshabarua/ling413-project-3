37,CONSECRATION,_Children we deemed you all the days

39,CONSECRATION,We vexed you with our care:
40,CONSECRATION,
41,CONSECRATION,"But in a Universe ablaze,"
42,CONSECRATION,
43,CONSECRATION,What was your childish share?
44,CONSECRATION,
45,CONSECRATION,"To rush upon the flames of Hell,"
46,CONSECRATION,
47,CONSECRATION,To quench them with your blood!
48,CONSECRATION,
49,CONSECRATION,To be of England's flower that fell
50,CONSECRATION,
51,CONSECRATION,Ere yet it brake the bud!

75,LORD'S LEAVE,
76,LORD'S LEAVE,(1915)
77,LORD'S LEAVE,
78,LORD'S LEAVE,
79,LORD'S LEAVE,No Lord's this year: no silken lawn on which
80,LORD'S LEAVE,
81,LORD'S LEAVE,A dignified and dainty throng meanders.
82,LORD'S LEAVE,
83,LORD'S LEAVE,The Schools take guard upon a fierier pitch
84,LORD'S LEAVE,
85,LORD'S LEAVE,Somewhere in Flanders.
86,LORD'S LEAVE,
87,LORD'S LEAVE,
88,LORD'S LEAVE,
89,LORD'S LEAVE,Bigger the cricket here; yet some who tried
90,LORD'S LEAVE,
91,LORD'S LEAVE,In vain to earn a Colour while at Eton
92,LORD'S LEAVE,
93,LORD'S LEAVE,Have found a place upon an England side
94,LORD'S LEAVE,
95,LORD'S LEAVE,That can't be beaten!
96,LORD'S LEAVE,
97,LORD'S LEAVE,
98,LORD'S LEAVE,
99,LORD'S LEAVE,A demon bowler's bowling with his head--
100,LORD'S LEAVE,
101,LORD'S LEAVE,His heart's as black as skins in Carolina!
102,LORD'S LEAVE,
103,LORD'S LEAVE,"Either he breaks, or shoots almost as dead"
104,LORD'S LEAVE,
105,LORD'S LEAVE,As Anne Regina;
106,LORD'S LEAVE,
107,LORD'S LEAVE,
108,LORD'S LEAVE,
109,LORD'S LEAVE,"While the deep-field-gun, trained upon your"
110,LORD'S LEAVE,
111,LORD'S LEAVE,"stumps,"
112,LORD'S LEAVE,
113,LORD'S LEAVE,From concrete grand-stand far beyond the
114,LORD'S LEAVE,
115,LORD'S LEAVE,"bound'ry,"
116,LORD'S LEAVE,
117,LORD'S LEAVE,Lifts up his ugly mouth and fairly pumps
118,LORD'S LEAVE,
119,LORD'S LEAVE,Shells from Krupp's foundry.
120,LORD'S LEAVE,
121,LORD'S LEAVE,
122,LORD'S LEAVE,
123,LORD'S LEAVE,But like the time the game is out of joint--
124,LORD'S LEAVE,
125,LORD'S LEAVE,"No screen, and too much mud for cricket"
126,LORD'S LEAVE,
127,LORD'S LEAVE,lover;
128,LORD'S LEAVE,
129,LORD'S LEAVE,"Both legs go slip, and there's sufficient point"
130,LORD'S LEAVE,
131,LORD'S LEAVE,In extra cover!
132,LORD'S LEAVE,
133,LORD'S LEAVE,
134,LORD'S LEAVE,
135,LORD'S LEAVE,Cricket? 'Tis Sanscrit to the super-Hun--
136,LORD'S LEAVE,
137,LORD'S LEAVE,"Cheap cross between Caligula and Cassius,"
138,LORD'S LEAVE,
139,LORD'S LEAVE,"To whom speech, prayer, and warfare are all"
140,LORD'S LEAVE,
141,LORD'S LEAVE,one--
142,LORD'S LEAVE,
143,LORD'S LEAVE,Equally gaseous!
144,LORD'S LEAVE,
145,LORD'S LEAVE,
146,LORD'S LEAVE,
147,LORD'S LEAVE,Playing a game's beyond him and his hordes;
148,LORD'S LEAVE,
149,LORD'S LEAVE,Theirs but to play the snake or wolf or
150,LORD'S LEAVE,
151,LORD'S LEAVE,vulture:
152,LORD'S LEAVE,
153,LORD'S LEAVE,Better one sporting lesson learnt at Lord's
154,LORD'S LEAVE,
155,LORD'S LEAVE,Than all their Kultur....
156,LORD'S LEAVE,
157,LORD'S LEAVE,
158,LORD'S LEAVE,
159,LORD'S LEAVE,Sinks a torpedoed Phoebus from our sight;
160,LORD'S LEAVE,
161,LORD'S LEAVE,Over the field of play see darkness stealing;
162,LORD'S LEAVE,
163,LORD'S LEAVE,"Only in this one game, against the light"
164,LORD'S LEAVE,
165,LORD'S LEAVE,There's no appealing.
166,LORD'S LEAVE,
167,LORD'S LEAVE,
168,LORD'S LEAVE,
169,LORD'S LEAVE,Now for their flares... and now at last the
170,LORD'S LEAVE,
171,LORD'S LEAVE,stars...
172,LORD'S LEAVE,
173,LORD'S LEAVE,"Only the stars now, in their heavenly million,"
174,LORD'S LEAVE,
175,LORD'S LEAVE,Glisten and blink for pity on our scars
176,LORD'S LEAVE,
177,LORD'S LEAVE,From the Pavilion.
178,LORD'S LEAVE,
