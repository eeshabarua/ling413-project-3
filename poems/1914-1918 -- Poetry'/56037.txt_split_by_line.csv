483,JACK,Are flooding through my skin.
484,JACK,My body drinks them in.
485,JACK,Like rich red veils they cling
486,JACK,About my prostrate head.
487,JACK,"I swoon into a bed,"
488,JACK,The heavy smells of Spring.

564,SKYLARK AND DAWN,(To Maurice Samuel)
565,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
566,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Stretched and silent they lie to the furious gold of the dawn,"
567,SKYLARK AND DAWN,And the earth like a leper's face is pitted and scarred.
568,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Firm in the grip of the wire relentless and hard,"
569,SKYLARK AND DAWN,They lie with their dead young faces pallid and drawn.
570,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
571,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Somewhere stupidly, thickly, a big gun booms!"
572,SKYLARK AND DAWN,A rifle cracks like the spit of a snake in the trees!
573,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"And ever the great sun rises, rolling the glooms"
574,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Of the sulphurous night to the fields and the cliffs and the seas.
575,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
576,SKYLARK AND DAWN,The groan of a dying man crawls out from his teeth!
577,SKYLARK AND DAWN,He groans no more: his lips become leaden and cold!
578,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"And ever the sun flashes forth like a sword from its sheath,"
579,SKYLARK AND DAWN,And dazzles the dawn with terrors of scarlet and gold.
580,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
581,SKYLARK AND DAWN,The guns snarl out like a dog reluctant and grim.
582,SKYLARK AND DAWN,The triggers of rifles loosen in blue numb hands.
583,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Faintly the wings of a silence frightened and dim
584,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Hover down closer over the blasted lands.
585,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
586,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Gods of the great wars,"
587,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Gods that stand
588,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Somewhere afar off,"
589,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Cruel and grand,"
590,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Silence, Silence,"
591,SKYLARK AND DAWN,In No Man's Land!
592,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
593,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Gods of the great wars,"
594,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Cruel and high,"
595,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Listen afar off!
596,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Grant us to die
597,SKYLARK AND DAWN,With the song of Silence
598,SKYLARK AND DAWN,In the morning sky!
599,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
600,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Gods of the great wars,"
601,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Gas-wave and gun,"
602,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Are ye not happy
603,SKYLARK AND DAWN,With the red work done?
604,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Drown ye the planets,"
605,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Shatter the sun!
606,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
607,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Not a twitching of bloodless lip or of glazing eye!
608,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"For the Silence is deeper than Noon and older than Time,"
609,SKYLARK AND DAWN,The Silence inert and intense of the far first sky
610,SKYLARK AND DAWN,When never a wind breathed over the primal slime.
611,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
612,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"The Sun is stayed in his march, and even Death"
613,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"With the flush of triumph mantling his cheeks of gloom,"
614,SKYLARK AND DAWN,He too stands still for an instant and holds his breath.
615,SKYLARK AND DAWN,A million of years passes by in a moment of doom.
616,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
617,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Suddenly!
618,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Terrible!  Wild!
619,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"A skylark shatters the spell,"
620,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"With a music more fiery than hell,"
621,SKYLARK AND DAWN,More frail than the laugh of a child!
622,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
623,SKYLARK AND DAWN,His little brown wings soar high to assault the sun.
624,SKYLARK AND DAWN,His little round throat sends a challenge audacious and far
625,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"To the pale-faced legions of Silence that waver and run,"
626,SKYLARK AND DAWN,To the uprisen dawn and every invisible star.
627,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
628,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Ah God! the song cuts deeper than tempered steel!
629,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"The eyes overflow with the surge of a salt harsh tear,"
630,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Again to listen to Music, again to feel"
631,SKYLARK AND DAWN,The uttermost glory of living when Death is so near!
632,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
633,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Scream of a shell! ...
634,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Dull dead thud in a trench,"
635,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Curses and flame and stench! ...
636,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
637,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Instantly all the white dawn,"
638,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Fragrant and frail and cool,"
639,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Breaks like a vase in the hands of a fool.
640,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"For the thick sick lips of Death have spoken,"
641,SKYLARK AND DAWN,The fine gold chain of the bird-song is broken.
642,SKYLARK AND DAWN,The lank dank hand of Death has withdrawn
643,SKYLARK AND DAWN,The curtain of bird-song and magic dawn
644,SKYLARK AND DAWN,From the sullen red windows of Hell.
645,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
646,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Rattle of rifle and shriek of gun,"
647,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Gas-cloud sickly and heavy and dun,"
648,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Death has taken his armies in hand,"
649,SKYLARK AND DAWN,And the bodies lie countless in No Man's Land.
650,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
651,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Out of the shock of the storm
652,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Where the foul winds meet and cry,"
653,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Something drops down at my feet,"
654,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"A little brown body and sweet,"
655,SKYLARK AND DAWN,A little dead body and warm.
656,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
657,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"The tiny dead throat shall sing no more,"
658,SKYLARK AND DAWN,Nor the quick eyes flash nor the swift wings soar;
659,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"But the shells shall hurtle, the grim guns roar,"
660,SKYLARK AND DAWN,O skylark out of the sky!
661,SKYLARK AND DAWN,
662,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"My singing is ended, the pall descended on land and sea."
663,SKYLARK AND DAWN,I sang my song to the tune of my own heart-beat
664,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"Between the sound of the wars, and there sang with me"
665,SKYLARK AND DAWN,"My little brother the skylark, dead at my feet."

714,JACK OF APRIL,Never a moment knew he pause.
715,JACK OF APRIL,Jack went swinging to the ships
716,JACK OF APRIL,"With a laughter on his lips,"
717,JACK OF APRIL,Jack went singing to the wars.
718,JACK OF APRIL,Jack among the boys and men
719,JACK OF APRIL,Went to France in April when
720,JACK OF APRIL,"Flowers and boys laughed all the day,"

723,JACK OF APRIL,"Even though the time was Spring,"

729,JACK OF APRIL,
730,JACK OF APRIL,"And he shuddered for a moment,"
731,JACK OF APRIL,"Blood and flame convulsed the day,"
732,JACK OF APRIL,"And he crumpled on the way,"
733,JACK OF APRIL,"And the scarlet tide went sweeping,"
734,JACK OF APRIL,"Heaping, heaping"
735,JACK OF APRIL,"Clay upon his trodden clay,"
736,JACK OF APRIL,"April, Spring!"
737,JACK OF APRIL,April!--can you wonder then
738,JACK OF APRIL,"That my bitten lips have said,"
739,JACK OF APRIL,"""Curst be men,"
740,JACK OF APRIL,"Now that Jack in lyric April,"
741,JACK OF APRIL,Jack is dead.

942,THE ADVENT OF MARS,
943,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Then suddenly ...
944,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"A thunder was heard like the cracking of suns,"
945,THE ADVENT OF MARS,A blackness blacker than blood there came
946,THE ADVENT OF MARS,To choke the world with a fume and a flame.
947,THE ADVENT OF MARS,A palsy fell on the guns.
948,THE ADVENT OF MARS,A numbness froze the hands
949,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Of the gunners in all the lands.
950,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Half-way over the parapet
951,THE ADVENT OF MARS,The limbs of the climbing infantry set
952,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Like limbs of basalt-stone.
953,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"The bayonets fell from the fingers numb,"
954,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"The throats of the officers dried dead-dumb,"
955,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"For the Terror had come, the Terror had come,"
956,THE ADVENT OF MARS,The Terror out of the stark Unknown!
957,THE ADVENT OF MARS,The Shadow was fallen upon the wars
958,THE ADVENT OF MARS,That had raged three centuries long
959,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"To shatter the Lie and Wrong,"
960,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"From the ice-fanged polar jaws,"
961,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"With never a lull nor pause,"
962,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"And over the Temperate Zone,"
963,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"With never a moment's rest,"
964,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"And over the Burning Line,"
965,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"With never a halting sign,"
966,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"And over the East and West,"
967,THE ADVENT OF MARS,And down to the ultimate mouth
968,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Of the white Antarctic South.
969,THE ADVENT OF MARS,From the torpid Esquimo-man
970,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Who slew his Esquimo-mate
971,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"And poured his fat in a plate,"
972,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"And lit up a wick therein,"
973,THE ADVENT OF MARS,And studied the secret plan
974,THE ADVENT OF MARS,For the poisonous new harpoon.
975,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Wherewith he was going to win
976,THE ADVENT OF MARS,The Esquimo-battle soon.
977,THE ADVENT OF MARS,From the Esquimo-man to the sinister black
978,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"Cannibal-boy in his skeleton-shack,"
979,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Whose ardent patriot labours
980,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"Were extracting the eyes of his foes,"
981,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"The bones of their fingers and toes,"
982,THE ADVENT OF MARS,To teach them never to violate
983,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"The inter-cannibal laws of State,"

1020,THE ADVENT OF MARS,In the pitch of your scorn
1021,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"Defiled the morn,"
1022,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Bitten deep death in the mould and the corn.
1023,THE ADVENT OF MARS,You have eaten the wings
1024,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Of the lily-like frail

1026,THE ADVENT OF MARS,You have festered the springs
1027,THE ADVENT OF MARS,With the corpses ye slew
1028,THE ADVENT OF MARS,And given your children to drink of the brew.
1029,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"Never a grace not violated,"
1030,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Left God never a roof nor wall;

1032,THE ADVENT OF MARS,Never a devil ye did not call.
1033,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"And a Word came forth from the Sun to Mars,"
1034,THE ADVENT OF MARS,'Gird ye now for the final wars!
1035,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"For over the planet of Earth,"
1036,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"Wooden and waste and wide,"
1037,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"Great red wounds in his side,"
1038,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"A shadow, a bloodless dearth"

1040,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"Throwing the ghost of a Cross on the skies,"

1042,THE ADVENT OF MARS,We have come with a gladness terrible to behold.

1047,THE ADVENT OF MARS,"Our weapons shall be flame and the blades be keen,"

2606,I DREAM'D I DIED,I DREAM'D I DIED
2607,I DREAM'D I DIED,
2608,I DREAM'D I DIED,I dream'd I died.
2609,I DREAM'D I DIED,The green of Spring was not yet manifest
2610,I DREAM'D I DIED,Upon the cold hillside.
2611,I DREAM'D I DIED,"They bore me slowly to my place of rest,"
2612,I DREAM'D I DIED,And let me bide.
2613,I DREAM'D I DIED,"Far from the pale I lay of space and light,"
2614,I DREAM'D I DIED,Of dusk and dawn.
2615,I DREAM'D I DIED,I knew the sharp stars of the winter night
2616,I DREAM'D I DIED,Were far withdrawn.
2617,I DREAM'D I DIED,"Silent I lay upon my bed,"
2618,I DREAM'D I DIED,In sooth at rest.
2619,I DREAM'D I DIED,"The earth pressed heavily on my head,"
2620,I DREAM'D I DIED,My lean hands cross'd my breast.
2621,I DREAM'D I DIED,I saw not through my eyes.
2622,I DREAM'D I DIED,"When I had faded from the room of sighs,"
2623,I DREAM'D I DIED,"Someone had sealed them down with clay,"
2624,I DREAM'D I DIED,"Had whispered, ""He hath seen the whole"
2625,I DREAM'D I DIED,"Of summer earth and starlit skies,"
2626,I DREAM'D I DIED,Or yellow hills of tumbled hay
2627,I DREAM'D I DIED,That he shall see.
2628,I DREAM'D I DIED,Here till the time of Judgment let him be.
2629,I DREAM'D I DIED,"God soothe his soul."""
2630,I DREAM'D I DIED,
2631,I DREAM'D I DIED,Under the moon
2632,I DREAM'D I DIED,I lay remote from the dear nightingale.
2633,I DREAM'D I DIED,"Late and soon,"
2634,I DREAM'D I DIED,Faintly I heard the wan wind drone and wail.
2635,I DREAM'D I DIED,"I dream'd,"
2636,I DREAM'D I DIED,Thro' many years it seemed:
2637,I DREAM'D I DIED,Until I wearied me of dreaming
2638,I DREAM'D I DIED,"And closed the windows of my soul,"
2639,I DREAM'D I DIED,Where no sun streaming
2640,I DREAM'D I DIED,Show'd how God's far far days did westward roll.
2641,I DREAM'D I DIED,"All blind, blind,"
2642,I DREAM'D I DIED,"A sea of sleep did drown me unconfin'd,"
2643,I DREAM'D I DIED,"Wide and deep,"
2644,I DREAM'D I DIED,"A sea of utter sleep,"
2645,I DREAM'D I DIED,Its levels no time stirred by any wind.
2646,I DREAM'D I DIED,"And so I slept,"
2647,I DREAM'D I DIED,My hands across my breast.
2648,I DREAM'D I DIED,My clamped spirit kept
2649,I DREAM'D I DIED,A total rest.

2652,I DREAM'D I DIED,
2653,I DREAM'D I DIED,"Earth of the Earth I slumber'd long,"
2654,I DREAM'D I DIED,"I slumber'd in the untrod glooms,"
2655,I DREAM'D I DIED,And then Dawn came.
2656,I DREAM'D I DIED,"I felt the world was glad with song,"
2657,I DREAM'D I DIED,I felt the hillsides were a flame
2658,I DREAM'D I DIED,Of king-cup blooms.
2659,I DREAM'D I DIED,"And when Dawn came,"
2660,I DREAM'D I DIED,Three times I knocked upon the door
2661,I DREAM'D I DIED,"Which was my seal, my world and sky,"
2662,I DREAM'D I DIED,Three times with might.
2663,I DREAM'D I DIED,"There came a burst of sound and light,"
2664,I DREAM'D I DIED,"A knowledge broad and deep and high,"
2665,I DREAM'D I DIED,The long breath of a sloping moor.
2666,I DREAM'D I DIED,"I looked into the daylight wide,"
2667,I DREAM'D I DIED,"A bird sang thro' the singing blue,"
2668,I DREAM'D I DIED,"And then, O heart, and then I knew"
2669,I DREAM'D I DIED,I _dream'd_ I died.

2786,AT LAST WAR ENDS,And still the War went on: till only ten
2787,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"Were left to win the War; they fought; and then,"
2788,AT LAST WAR ENDS,Then there were no more men.
2789,AT LAST WAR ENDS,
2790,AT LAST WAR ENDS,There was a gloom of apprehension lest
2791,AT LAST WAR ENDS,For lack of flesh the first and last and best
2792,AT LAST WAR ENDS,Of wars might be suppressed.
2793,AT LAST WAR ENDS,
2794,AT LAST WAR ENDS,But Mars was far too sage to be surprised.
2795,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"Now that the race of men were quite demised,"
2796,AT LAST WAR ENDS,The women mobilized.
2797,AT LAST WAR ENDS,
2798,AT LAST WAR ENDS,So now for gassier gas and flamier flame!
2799,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"Compared with what the present War became,"
2800,AT LAST WAR ENDS,The old War was a game.
2801,AT LAST WAR ENDS,
2802,AT LAST WAR ENDS,The old had fifty years in which to thrive;
2803,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"When this had lasted only twenty-five,"
2804,AT LAST WAR ENDS,Two dames remained alive.
2805,AT LAST WAR ENDS,
2806,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"With flammen-werfer strictly up-to-date,"
2807,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"They stalked each other, singing Hymns of Hate:"
2808,AT LAST WAR ENDS,--But one was just too late!
2809,AT LAST WAR ENDS,
2810,AT LAST WAR ENDS,The Victress trying vainly to decide
2811,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"For whom her late opponent had just died,"
2812,AT LAST WAR ENDS,Committed suicide.
2813,AT LAST WAR ENDS,
2814,AT LAST WAR ENDS,So now the world consisted but of trees
2815,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"And dogs and beetles livid with disease,"
2816,AT LAST WAR ENDS,And babies blue with fleas.
2817,AT LAST WAR ENDS,
2818,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"Trees, dogs, and beetles perished from the day."
2819,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"Like flies brought crawling earthwards by a spray,"
2820,AT LAST WAR ENDS,The babies dropped away.
2821,AT LAST WAR ENDS,
2822,AT LAST WAR ENDS,Now truly War seemed ended.  Mars was pained
2823,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"Beyond expression till he ascertained,"
2824,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"Two babes, thank God! remained."
2825,AT LAST WAR ENDS,
2826,AT LAST WAR ENDS,He fired them with the fury of all wars.
2827,AT LAST WAR ENDS,A bloody hunger stung their toothless jaws.
2828,AT LAST WAR ENDS,"They squealed--""The Cause!  The Cause!"""
