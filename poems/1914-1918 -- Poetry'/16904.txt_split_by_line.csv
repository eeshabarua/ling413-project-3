20,,The paper famine leaving me no option
21,,"but to print on peculiar paper, not wholly"
22,,prohibitive or to defer the publication of my
23,,"verses for an unknown period, the natural"
24,,"longing of a parent to parade his ""well be-"

26,,"bizarre from a craftman's point of view,"
27,,I plead the unusual times and extraordinary
28,,conditions. Of these times and conditions.

36,AUSTRALIA.,
37,AUSTRALIA.,"AUSTRALIA, my native land,"
38,AUSTRALIA.,A stirring whisper in your ear--
39,AUSTRALIA.,'Tis time for you to understand
40,AUSTRALIA.,"Your rating now is A1, dear."
41,AUSTRALIA.,You've done some rousing things of late.
42,AUSTRALIA.,That lift you from the simple state
43,AUSTRALIA.,In which you chose to vegetate.
44,AUSTRALIA.,
45,AUSTRALIA.,"The persons so superior,"
46,AUSTRALIA.,"Whose patronage no more endures,"
47,AUSTRALIA.,Now have to fire a salvo for
48,AUSTRALIA.,The glory that is fairly yours.
49,AUSTRALIA.,"At length you need no sort of crutch,"
50,AUSTRALIA.,"You stand alone, you're voted ""much""--"
51,AUSTRALIA.,Get busy  and behave as such.
52,AUSTRALIA.,
53,AUSTRALIA.,"No man from Oskosh, or from Hull,"
54,AUSTRALIA.,Or any other chosen place
55,AUSTRALIA.,"Can rise with a distended skull,"
56,AUSTRALIA.,And cast aspersions in your face.
57,AUSTRALIA.,You're given all the world to know
58,AUSTRALIA.,"Your proper standing as a foe,"
59,AUSTRALIA.,"And hats are off, and rightly so."
60,AUSTRALIA.,
61,AUSTRALIA.,"You furnished heroes for the fray,"
62,AUSTRALIA.,Your sterling merit's widely blown
63,AUSTRALIA.,"To all men's satisfaction say,"
64,AUSTRALIA.,Now have you proved it to your own?
65,AUSTRALIA.,Now have you strength to stand and shine
66,AUSTRALIA.,"In your own light and say, ""Divine"
67,AUSTRALIA.,"The thing is that I do. It's mine!"""
68,AUSTRALIA.,
69,AUSTRALIA.,The cannon's stroke throws customs down
70,AUSTRALIA.,"The black and bottomless abyss,"
71,AUSTRALIA.,And quaking are the gilded crown
72,AUSTRALIA.,And palsied feet of prejudice.
73,AUSTRALIA.,"The guns have killed, but it is true"
74,AUSTRALIA.,They bring to life things good and new.
75,AUSTRALIA.,God grant they have awakened you!
76,AUSTRALIA.,
77,AUSTRALIA.,My ears are greedy for the toast
78,AUSTRALIA.,"Of confidence before our guest,"
79,AUSTRALIA.,"The loyal song, the manly boast"
80,AUSTRALIA.,Your splendid faith to manifest.
81,AUSTRALIA.,In works of art and livelihood
82,AUSTRALIA.,"Shirk not the creed, ""What's ours is good,"""
83,AUSTRALIA.,Dread not to have it understood.
84,AUSTRALIA.,
85,AUSTRALIA.,"Australia, lift your royal brow,"
86,AUSTRALIA.,"And have the courage of our pride,"
87,AUSTRALIA.,"Audacity becomes you now,"
88,AUSTRALIA.,"Be splendidly self-satisfied,"
89,AUSTRALIA.,No land from lowliness and dearth
90,AUSTRALIA.,Has won to eminence on earth
91,AUSTRALIA.,That was not conscious of its worth.

138,BILLY KHAKI,
139,BILLY KHAKI,MARCHING somewhat out of order
140,BILLY KHAKI,"when the band is cock-a-hoop,"
141,BILLY KHAKI,There's a lilting kind of magic in the swagger
142,BILLY KHAKI,"of the troop,"
143,BILLY KHAKI,Swinging all aboard the steamer with her
144,BILLY KHAKI,nose toward the sea.
145,BILLY KHAKI,"What is calling, Billy Khaki, that you're foot-"
146,BILLY KHAKI,ing it so free?
147,BILLY KHAKI,
148,BILLY KHAKI,"Though his lines are none too level,"
149,BILLY KHAKI,And he lacks a bit of style.
150,BILLY KHAKI,And he's swanking like the devil
151,BILLY KHAKI,"Where the women wave and smile,"
152,BILLY KHAKI,He will answer with a rifle
153,BILLY KHAKI,"Trim and true from stock to bore,"
154,BILLY KHAKI,Where the comrades crouch and stifle
155,BILLY KHAKI,In the reeking pit of war.
156,BILLY KHAKI,
157,BILLY KHAKI,"What is calling, Billy Khaki? There is"
158,BILLY KHAKI,"thunder down the sky,"
159,BILLY KHAKI,And the merry magpie bugle splits the morn-
160,BILLY KHAKI,"ing with its cry,"
161,BILLY KHAKI,While your feet are beating rhythms up the
162,BILLY KHAKI,"dusty hills and down,"
163,BILLY KHAKI,And the drums are all a-talking in the hollow
164,BILLY KHAKI,of the town.
165,BILLY KHAKI,
166,BILLY KHAKI,"Billy Khaki, is't the splendor of the song the"
167,BILLY KHAKI,"kiddies sing,"
168,BILLY KHAKI,Or the whipping of the flags aloft that sets
169,BILLY KHAKI,your heart a-swing?
170,BILLY KHAKI,Is't the cheering like a paean of the toss-
171,BILLY KHAKI,"ing, teeming crowds,"
172,BILLY KHAKI,Or the boom of distant cannon flatly bumping
173,BILLY KHAKI,on the clouds ?
174,BILLY KHAKI,
175,BILLY KHAKI,"What's calling, calling, Billy? 'Tis the rattle"
176,BILLY KHAKI,far away
177,BILLY KHAKI,Of the cavalry at gallop and artillery in play;
178,BILLY KHAKI,"'Tis the great gun's fierce concussion, and the"
179,BILLY KHAKI,smell of seven hells
180,BILLY KHAKI,When the long ranks go to pieces in the
181,BILLY KHAKI,sneezing of the shells.
182,BILLY KHAKI,
183,BILLY KHAKI,"But your eyes are laughing, Billy, and a"
184,BILLY KHAKI,"ribald song you sing,"
185,BILLY KHAKI,While the old men sit and tell us war it is a
186,BILLY KHAKI,"ghastly thing,"
187,BILLY KHAKI,When the swift machines are busy and the
188,BILLY KHAKI,"grim, squat fortress nocks"
189,BILLY KHAKI,At your bolts as vain as eggs of gulls that spatter on the rocks.
190,BILLY KHAKI,
191,BILLY KHAKI,When the horses sweep upon you to complete
192,BILLY KHAKI,"a sudden rout,"
193,BILLY KHAKI,Or in fire and smoke and fury some brave
194,BILLY KHAKI,"regiment goes out,"
195,BILLY KHAKI,"War is cruel, Bill, and ugly. But full well"
196,BILLY KHAKI,"you know the rest,"
197,BILLY KHAKI,"Yet your heart is for the battle, and your face"
198,BILLY KHAKI,is to the west.
199,BILLY KHAKI,
200,BILLY KHAKI,"For if war is beastly, Billy, you can picture"
201,BILLY KHAKI,something worse--
202,BILLY KHAKI,"There's the wrecking of an empire, and its"
203,BILLY KHAKI,broken people's curse;
204,BILLY KHAKI,"There are nations reft of freedom, and of hope"
205,BILLY KHAKI,"and kindly mirth,"
206,BILLY KHAKI,And the shadow of an evil black upon the
207,BILLY KHAKI,bitter earth.
208,BILLY KHAKI,
209,BILLY KHAKI,"So we know what's calling, Billy. 'Tis the"
210,BILLY KHAKI,"spirit of our race,"
211,BILLY KHAKI,"And its stir is in your pulses, and its light is"
212,BILLY KHAKI,on your face
213,BILLY KHAKI,As you march with clipping boot-heels
214,BILLY KHAKI,"through the piping, howling town"
215,BILLY KHAKI,"To uphold the land we live in, and to pull a"
216,BILLY KHAKI,tyrant down.
217,BILLY KHAKI,
218,BILLY KHAKI,"Thou his lines are none too level,"
219,BILLY KHAKI,"And he's not a whale for style,"
220,BILLY KHAKI,And he's swanking like the devil
221,BILLY KHAKI,When the women wave and smile
222,BILLY KHAKI,"He will answer with a rifle,"
223,BILLY KHAKI,"Trim and true from stuck to bore,"
224,BILLY KHAKI,When the comrades sit and stifle
225,BILLY KHAKI,In the smoking pit of war.

232,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,The world's heart throb at my workshop door.
233,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"The sun was keen, and the day was still;"
234,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"The township drowsed in, a haze of heat."
235,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"A stir far off on the sleepy hill,"
236,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"The measured beat of their buoyant feet,"
237,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,And the lilt and thrum
238,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"Of a little drum,"
239,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"The song they sang in a cadence low,"
240,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,The piping note of a piccolo.
241,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,
242,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"The township woke, and the doors flew wide;"
243,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,The women trotted their boys beside.
244,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,Across the bridge on a single heel
245,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"The soldiers came in a golden glow,"
246,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"With throb of song and the chink of steel,"
247,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,The gallant crow of the piccolo.
248,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"Good and brown they were,"
249,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,And their arms swung bare.
250,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,Their fine young faces revived in me
251,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,A boyhood's vision of chivalry.
252,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,
253,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"The lean, hard regiment tramping down,"
254,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"Bushies, miners and boys from town."
255,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,From 'mid the watchers the road along
256,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,One fell in line with the khaki men.
257,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"He took the stride, and he caught their song,"
258,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"And Steve went then, and Meneer, and Ben,"
259,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"Long Dave McCree,"
260,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"And the Weavers three,"
261,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"All whisked away by the ""Come! Come! Come!"""
262,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,The lusty surge of the vaunting drum.
263,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,
264,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,I swore a prayer for each soldier lad.
265,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,He was the son that might have had;
266,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"The tall, bold boy who was never mine,"
267,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"All brave with dust that the eyes laughed through,"
268,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"His shoulders square, and his chin in line,"
269,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,Was marching too with the gallant few.
270,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,Passed the muffled beat
271,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"Of their swanking feet,"
272,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"The swell of drum, the exulting crow,"
273,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,The wild-bird note of the piccolo.
274,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,
275,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,They dipped away in the listless trees;
276,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,A mother wept on her beaded knees
277,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,For sons gone out to the long war's end;
278,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,But more than mother or man wept I
279,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,Who had no son in the world to send.
280,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"The hour lagged by, and drifting high"
281,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,Came the fitful hum
282,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"Of the little drum,"
283,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"And faint, but still with an ardent flow,"
284,AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH,"The pibroch, call of the piccolo."
