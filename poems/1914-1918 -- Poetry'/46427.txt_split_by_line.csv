186,PAGE,The selections contained in this book make up a sequence which records
187,PAGE,"the history of the Great War from the stirring days of August, 1914, to"
188,PAGE,"the opening of the Peace Conference in January, 1919. These selections"
189,PAGE,"of verse and prose are arranged, not necessarily in chronological"
190,PAGE,"order, but still with a view to indicate approximately the historic"
191,PAGE,succession of great events and the varying moods of those authors and
192,PAGE,speakers who have been the voices of the allied nations during the
193,PAGE,fifty-two months of warfare.
194,PAGE,
195,PAGE,"Although this anthology has been prepared for the use of schools, the"
196,PAGE,plan of selection and arrangement has made it impracticable to grade
197,PAGE,the poems and extracts to suit the capacities of pupils of different
198,PAGE,ages. The judgment of the teacher must determine what is suitable for
199,PAGE,one grade and what for another. Many of the poems and some of the prose
200,PAGE,extracts will be found too difficult for young pupils.
201,PAGE,
202,PAGE,Due acknowledgments have been made throughout the book to the authors
203,PAGE,and publishers who have generously made it possible to bring together
204,PAGE,so valuable a collection of the literature of the War. The meed
205,PAGE,of gratitude due to all the writers represented here can never be
206,PAGE,"adequately paid. Special mention is made of Nizamat Jung, Native"
207,PAGE,"Judge of the High Court of Hyderabad, who has given expression to the"
208,PAGE,"wonderful loyalty of the races of teeming India, which have poured out"
209,PAGE,treasure and blood without stint in defence of their Emperor-King.
210,PAGE,
211,PAGE,_A sufficient number of copies of this book should be kept in all
212,PAGE,school libraries; and it is suggested that the poems and prose extracts
213,PAGE,"should be used in the reading classes, as often as is expedient,"
214,PAGE,instead of the authorized Readers._

219,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
220,INTRODUCTION,
221,INTRODUCTION,
222,INTRODUCTION,The boys and girls of this generation have had the opportunity and
223,INTRODUCTION,responsibility of living through great times. In days to come they
224,INTRODUCTION,"will look back with a feeling akin to awe on the hours when, in Sir"
225,INTRODUCTION,"Owen Seaman's words, they ""saw the Powers of Darkness put to flight"""
226,INTRODUCTION,"and ""saw the morning break."" The future of our country will be"
227,INTRODUCTION,determined by the youth of to-day. Problems of the greatest complexity
228,INTRODUCTION,"and perplexity await solution, and can be solved only by honesty,"
229,INTRODUCTION,"intelligence, sympathy, breadth of outlook, sacrificial service, and"
230,INTRODUCTION,the fear of God. The teachers and pupils now in our schools are in the
231,INTRODUCTION,"midst of a great crisis, and will need greatness of soul that they may"
232,INTRODUCTION,rightly face it. That they will respond nobly to the challenge of the
233,INTRODUCTION,"age, I have not the shadow of a doubt."
234,INTRODUCTION,
235,INTRODUCTION,Never was there a more timely occasion for the teaching of an ardent
236,INTRODUCTION,and enlightened patriotism. Those who understand the issues at stake in
237,INTRODUCTION,"the Great War, the genius of the world-wide British Commonwealth, the"
238,INTRODUCTION,"national consciousness of our own fair Canada, the lessons taught us by"
239,INTRODUCTION,"the mighty struggle, will be well-instructed citizens of this Dominion,"
240,INTRODUCTION,"equipped by knowledge and by spirit to serve their country, their"
241,INTRODUCTION,"Empire, and the world."
242,INTRODUCTION,
243,INTRODUCTION,The selections of Verse and Prose in this book set forth the varying
244,INTRODUCTION,"and successive phases of the War, and seek to remind, to inform, and to"
245,INTRODUCTION,inspire. The teachers will use them as vehicles of moral and patriotic
246,INTRODUCTION,instruction. The pupils will keep them forever in their hearts and
247,INTRODUCTION,minds. Surely if we wish to introduce any good element into the life of
248,INTRODUCTION,"a nation, it can best be introduced through its schools and colleges."
249,INTRODUCTION,
250,INTRODUCTION,It is well to recall the issues that have been decided; for in no
251,INTRODUCTION,struggle have greater hung in the balance. The crime perpetrated
252,INTRODUCTION,"against the Belgians, aggravated by its accompanying treachery and"
253,INTRODUCTION,"brutality and immediately followed by unparalleled sanguinary atrocity,"
254,INTRODUCTION,revealed as by a lurid flash the nature and the greatness of the menace
255,INTRODUCTION,"to which Christian civilization was exposed. Prussian militarism, in"
256,INTRODUCTION,"this belated, almost incredible but all too terrible, outbreak of"
257,INTRODUCTION,"Pagan barbarism, threatened to overthrow all the best elements in"
258,INTRODUCTION,international life.
259,INTRODUCTION,
260,INTRODUCTION,"(1) The very idea of a Commonwealth of Europe, the growing sense of"
261,INTRODUCTION,"solidarity, the recognition of general interests, the existence of"
262,INTRODUCTION,international institutions such as the Hague Tribunal--were seen to be
263,INTRODUCTION,"doomed, if Germany should come forth a victor."

280,INTRODUCTION,"(5) Democracy, with all it implies of self-government, freedom from"

284,INTRODUCTION,
285,INTRODUCTION,"(6) The future development of all the Free States of the world, the"
286,INTRODUCTION,"Entente Powers and the neutrals, was threatened by the German blow"
287,INTRODUCTION,"for world-power. The very existence of the British Empire as a free,"
288,INTRODUCTION,"prosperous, and progressive commonwealth, was imperilled. The freedom"
289,INTRODUCTION,of our own Dominion was assailed.
290,INTRODUCTION,
291,INTRODUCTION,"(7) Behind all political and material interests, profound moral issues"
292,INTRODUCTION,"were at stake. The struggle was against the ""armed doctrine,""--that"
293,INTRODUCTION,"diabolical perversion of all sound political thinking,--that the"
294,INTRODUCTION,"essence of the State is might, that the State is above all moral"
295,INTRODUCTION,"restraints, that war is its normal and noblest activity, and that war"
296,INTRODUCTION,may be waged with pitiless ferocity and scientific frightfulness.
297,INTRODUCTION,
298,INTRODUCTION,"All the forces that opposed freedom, self-government, and progress"
299,INTRODUCTION,gathered around the despotisms of Central Europe. In 1914 they made
300,INTRODUCTION,their bid for world dominion. Never before had so much been at stake;
301,INTRODUCTION,"perhaps never again will such issues be put to the test. Thank God, the"
302,INTRODUCTION,judgment has been given; the righteous government of the world has been
303,INTRODUCTION,vindicated; Right has triumphed over Might.
304,INTRODUCTION,
305,INTRODUCTION,Gradually the real nature of the struggle was recognized by the free
306,INTRODUCTION,peoples of the world. Their sons felt they were summoned to a new
307,INTRODUCTION,"crusade. They went forth as champions of democracy against autocracy,"
308,INTRODUCTION,"of freedom against tyranny, of mercy against ruthlessness, of justice"
309,INTRODUCTION,"against iniquity, of decency against shamefulness, of good faith"
310,INTRODUCTION,"against perfidy, of Right against Might, of peace against war, of"
311,INTRODUCTION,humane and Christian civilization against savage and pagan barbarism.
312,INTRODUCTION,All the world was presently forced to give a moral and political
313,INTRODUCTION,judgment on the issues.
314,INTRODUCTION,
315,INTRODUCTION,"Our own glorious British Empire, with its traditions of justice,"
316,INTRODUCTION,"honour, and liberty, soon became the soul and centre of the Allied"
317,INTRODUCTION,"resistance. By her Fleet, by her Armies, by her aircraft, by her"
318,INTRODUCTION,"financing, by her supplies, by her indomitable spirit--she endured"
319,INTRODUCTION,and smote the foe. We pay grateful tribute to the achievements of all
320,INTRODUCTION,our Allies in the common cause; but we do not forget Britain's mighty
321,INTRODUCTION,burden.
322,INTRODUCTION,
323,INTRODUCTION,"Among the British Armies, no troops have won higher distinction than"
324,INTRODUCTION,"the Canadian Corps, under their great leader, Sir Arthur Currie. They"
325,INTRODUCTION,were ranked among the most formidable fighting units on the Western
326,INTRODUCTION,"Front, and as an offensive spear-head of shock troops they were"
327,INTRODUCTION,unsurpassed. They fought in almost every critical engagement of the
328,INTRODUCTION,"War. They ""saved the day"" at the second Battle of Ypres, in face of the"
329,INTRODUCTION,hideous emission of poison gas; they fought in the long-drawn agony of
330,INTRODUCTION,"the Somme; they won Vimy Ridge, Hill 70, and Passchendaele in 1917;"
331,INTRODUCTION,"they were in the thickest of the battle in the last ""hundred days"", as"
332,INTRODUCTION,"they fought triumphantly at Amiens, Arras, Cambrai, Valenciennes, and"
333,INTRODUCTION,"Mons. The last blow struck before the Armistice was signed, was struck"
334,INTRODUCTION,"by the Canadians, who entered Mons early on the morning of the eleventh"
335,INTRODUCTION,of November. The course of the war for the British Armies on the
336,INTRODUCTION,"Western Front was _from Mons_, where the ""Old Contemptibles"" were flung"
337,INTRODUCTION,"into the furnace of the fight in August, 1914, _to Mons_, won by our"
338,INTRODUCTION,"men from overseas in November, 1918. It was ""a long, long way"", a way"
339,INTRODUCTION,"stained by blood and sweat, but at last the grim journey ended. Canada"
340,INTRODUCTION,has made a worthy contribution to world-freedom and world-brotherhood.
341,INTRODUCTION,
342,INTRODUCTION,"Canada is dearer to us than ever, because it has been purchased anew"
343,INTRODUCTION,at a great cost of precious blood. Those who have fallen are worthy of
344,INTRODUCTION,"everlasting remembrance. They will be commemorated by public monuments,"
345,INTRODUCTION,"by tablets of bronze, or brass or marble in public buildings, by"
346,INTRODUCTION,"""storied windows richly dight"". They deserve this. But, before God,"
347,INTRODUCTION,they deserve at our hands a better monument--even the monument of
348,INTRODUCTION,"a purer, nobler Canada, more intelligent, more united, more sober,"
349,INTRODUCTION,"more kindly, more God-fearing. Dying for Canada, they have recreated"
350,INTRODUCTION,Canada. Let us be worthy of those whose deaths have kept us free.
351,INTRODUCTION,
352,INTRODUCTION,"Through the experiences of these recent years, we have learned the"
353,INTRODUCTION,possibilities of heroism latent in every man. We need not hesitate to
354,INTRODUCTION,make high demands on our citizens for worthy ends. We have regained
355,INTRODUCTION,"a right sense of the relative value of things, and we know that the"
356,INTRODUCTION,"first things are those which are ideal, spiritual, eternal. We know"
357,INTRODUCTION,that persons are of infinitely more value than things; that the
358,INTRODUCTION,development and enrichment of personality mark the only true advance
359,INTRODUCTION,in civilization; and that the basis of national progress is the
360,INTRODUCTION,"health, efficiency, and spiritual well-being of the people. We have"
361,INTRODUCTION,realized the power of organized effort. We shall not forget the bonds
362,INTRODUCTION,of sympathy which common sorrows have created. We have gained a wider
363,INTRODUCTION,outlook on the world and a truer conception of the meaning of Empire.
364,INTRODUCTION,We understand more clearly the national problems that lie before us
365,INTRODUCTION,in this new era. A better Canada will not come of itself. It must be
366,INTRODUCTION,"planned for and striven for. But it will come, if there is kindled in"
367,INTRODUCTION,the souls of our citizens the same flame of sacrifice and service which
368,INTRODUCTION,burned so brightly in the hearts of Canada's citizen-soldiers of the
369,INTRODUCTION,Great War.

442,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,
443,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,You are ordered abroad as a soldier of the King to help our French
444,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,comrades against the invasion of a common enemy. You have to perform a
445,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,"task which will need your courage, your energy, your patience. Remember"
446,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,that the honour of the British Army depends on your individual conduct.
447,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,
448,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,"It will be your duty, not only to set an example of discipline and"
449,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,"perfect steadiness under fire, but also to maintain the most friendly"
450,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,relations with those whom you are helping in this struggle. The
451,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,"operations in which you are engaged will, for the most part, take"
452,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,"place in a friendly country, and you can do your own country no better"

455,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,
456,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,"Be invariably courteous, considerate, and kind. Never do anything"

458,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,disgraceful act. You are sure to meet with a welcome and to be trusted;
459,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,your conduct must justify that welcome and that trust.
460,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,
461,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,Your duty cannot be done unless your health is sound. So keep
462,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,constantly on your guard against any excesses. In this new experience
463,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,you may find temptations both in wine and women. You must entirely
464,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,"resist both temptations, and, while treating all women with perfect"
465,LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH SOLDIER,"courtesy, you should avoid any intimacy."

531,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,
532,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,
533,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"My Lords, as this is the first time I have had the honour of addressing"
534,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"your Lordships, I must ask for the indulgence of the House. In the"
535,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"first place, I desire to make a personal statement. Noble Lords on both"
536,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,sides of the House doubtless know that while associating myself in the
537,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,fullest degree for the prosecution of the war with my colleagues in
538,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"His Majesty's Government, my position on this bench does not in any"
539,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"way imply that I belong to any political party, for, as a soldier, I"
540,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,have no politics. Another point is that my occupation of the post of
541,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,Secretary of State for War is a temporary one. The terms of my service
542,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,are the same as those under which some of the finest portions of
543,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"our manhood, now so willingly stepping forward to join the colours,"
544,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"are engaging--that is to say, for the war, or, if it lasts longer"
545,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"than three years, then for three years. It has been asked why this"
546,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,latter limit has been fixed. It is because that should this disastrous
547,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,war be prolonged--and no one can foretell with any certainty its
548,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,duration--then after three years' war there will be others fresh and
549,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,fully prepared to take our places and see this matter through.
550,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,
551,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,The very serious conflict in which we are now engaged on the Continent
552,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,has been none of our seeking. It will undoubtedly strain the resources
553,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,of our Empire and entail considerable sacrifices on our people. These
554,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,will be willingly borne for our honour and for the preservation of
555,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,our position in the world; and they will be shared by our Dominions
556,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"beyond the seas, now sending contingents and assistance of every kind"
557,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"to help the Mother Country in this struggle. If I am unable, owing to"
558,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,military considerations for the best interests of the Allied Armies in
559,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"the field, to speak with much detail on the present situation of our"
560,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"Army on the Continent, I am sure your Lordships will pardon me for the"
561,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,necessary restraint which is imposed upon me.
562,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,
563,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,The Expeditionary Force has taken the field on the French North-West
564,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"frontier, and advanced to the neighbourhood of Mons in Belgium."
565,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,Our troops have already been for thirty-six hours in contact with
566,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,a superior force of German invaders. During that time they have
567,STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER,"maintained the traditions of British soldiers, and have behaved with"

745,A CALL TO ARMS,
746,A CALL TO ARMS,
747,A CALL TO ARMS,The issue has passed out of the domain of argument into another field.
748,A CALL TO ARMS,"But let me ask you, and through you the world outside, what would"
749,A CALL TO ARMS,"have been our condition to-day, if through timidity, or through a"
750,A CALL TO ARMS,"perverted calculation of self-interest, or through a paralysis of the"
751,A CALL TO ARMS,"sense of honour and duty, we had been base enough to be false to our"
752,A CALL TO ARMS,word and faithless to our friends? Our eyes would have been turned
753,A CALL TO ARMS,"at this moment, with those of the whole civilized world, to Belgium,"
754,A CALL TO ARMS,a small State which has lived for more than seventy years under a
755,A CALL TO ARMS,"several and collective guarantee to which we, in common with Prussia"
756,A CALL TO ARMS,"and Austria, were parties. We should have seen, at the instance and"
757,A CALL TO ARMS,"by the action of two of those guaranteeing Powers, her neutrality"
758,A CALL TO ARMS,"violated, her independence strangled, her territory made use of as"
759,A CALL TO ARMS,affording the easiest and most convenient road to a war of unprovoked
760,A CALL TO ARMS,"aggression against France. We, the British people, should at this"
761,A CALL TO ARMS,"moment be standing by, with folded arms and with such countenance as"
762,A CALL TO ARMS,"we could command, while this small and unprotected State, in defence"
763,A CALL TO ARMS,"of her vital liberties, made a heroic stand against overweening and"
764,A CALL TO ARMS,overwhelming force. We should have been admiring as detached spectators
765,A CALL TO ARMS,"the siege of Liège, the steady and manful resistance of a small"
766,A CALL TO ARMS,"army, the occupation of Brussels with all its splendid traditions"
767,A CALL TO ARMS,"and memories, the gradual forcing back of the patriotic defenders"
768,A CALL TO ARMS,"of their fatherland to the ramparts of Antwerp, countless outrages"
769,A CALL TO ARMS,"suffered by them, buccaneering levies exacted from the unoffending"
770,A CALL TO ARMS,"civil population, and, finally, the greatest crime committed against"
771,A CALL TO ARMS,"civilization and culture since the Thirty Years' War, the sack of"
772,A CALL TO ARMS,"Louvain, with its buildings, its pictures, its unique library,"
773,A CALL TO ARMS,"its unrivalled associations, a shameless holocaust of irreparable"
774,A CALL TO ARMS,"treasures, lit up by blind barbarian vengeance. What account could we,"
775,A CALL TO ARMS,"the Government and the people of this country, have been able to render"
776,A CALL TO ARMS,"to the tribunal of our national conscience and sense of honour, if, in"
777,A CALL TO ARMS,"defiance of our plighted and solemn obligations, we had endured, and"
778,A CALL TO ARMS,"had not done our best to prevent, yes, to avenge, these intolerable"
779,A CALL TO ARMS,"wrongs? For my part, I say that sooner than be a silent witness, which"
780,A CALL TO ARMS,"means in effect a willing accomplice, to this tragic triumph of force"
781,A CALL TO ARMS,"over law, and of brutality over freedom, I would see this country of"
782,A CALL TO ARMS,ours blotted out of the pages of history.

786,A CALL TO ARMS,"Is there any one in this hall, or in this United Kingdom, or in the"
787,A CALL TO ARMS,"vast Empire of which we here stand in the capital and centre, who"
788,A CALL TO ARMS,"blames us or repents our decision? If not, as I believe there is not,"
789,A CALL TO ARMS,"we must steel ourselves to the task, and, in the spirit which animated"
790,A CALL TO ARMS,"our forefathers in their struggle against the dominion of Napoleon, we"
791,A CALL TO ARMS,"must, and we shall, persevere to the end."
792,A CALL TO ARMS,
793,A CALL TO ARMS,"It would be a criminal mistake to underestimate either the magnitude,"
794,A CALL TO ARMS,"the fighting quality, or the staying power of the forces which are"
795,A CALL TO ARMS,arrayed against us; but it would be equally foolish and equally
796,A CALL TO ARMS,indefensible to belittle our own resources whether for resistance or
797,A CALL TO ARMS,for attack. Belgium has shown us by memorable and glorious example what
798,A CALL TO ARMS,can be done by a relatively small State when its citizens are animated
799,A CALL TO ARMS,and fired by the spirit of patriotism.

817,A CALL TO ARMS,rivalry. Two divisions of our magnificent Indian Army are already on
818,A CALL TO ARMS,their way. We welcome with appreciation and affection their proffered
819,A CALL TO ARMS,"aid, and, in an Empire which knows no distinction of race or class,"
820,A CALL TO ARMS,"where all alike, as subjects of the King-Emperor, are joint and equal"
821,A CALL TO ARMS,"custodians of our common interest and fortunes, we here hail with"
822,A CALL TO ARMS,profound and heartfelt gratitude their association side by side and
823,A CALL TO ARMS,"shoulder to shoulder with our home and Dominion troops, under the flag"
824,A CALL TO ARMS,which is a symbol to all of a unity that the world in arms cannot

831,A CALL TO ARMS,"United Empire, in a cause worthy of the highest traditions of our race."
832,A CALL TO ARMS,Let us keep in mind the patient and indomitable seamen who never relax
833,A CALL TO ARMS,"for a moment, night or day, their stern vigil on the lonely sea. Let"
834,A CALL TO ARMS,"us keep in mind our gallant troops, who to-day, after a fortnight's"

1915,CHRIST IN FLANDERS,You touched its ribaldry and made it fine.
1916,CHRIST IN FLANDERS,You stood beside us in our pain and weakness--
1917,CHRIST IN FLANDERS,We're glad to think You understand our weakness--
1918,CHRIST IN FLANDERS,Somehow it seems to help us not to whine.

3141,VERDUN,"me those who have come back from battle, those who will be fighting"
3142,VERDUN,"to-morrow, and those who, with you, General, are sentries on these"
3143,VERDUN,impregnable walls. The name of Verdun alone will be enough to rouse
3144,VERDUN,imperishable memories throughout the centuries to come. There is not
3145,VERDUN,one of the great feats of arms which make the history of France which
3146,VERDUN,better shows the high qualities of the Army and the people of France;
3147,VERDUN,"and that bravery and devotion to country, to which the world has ever"
3148,VERDUN,"paid homage, have been strengthened by a sang-froid and tenacity which"
3149,VERDUN,yield nothing to British phlegm.
3150,VERDUN,
3151,VERDUN,The memory of the victorious resistance of Verdun will be immortal
3152,VERDUN,"because Verdun saved not only France, but the whole of the great cause"
3153,VERDUN,which is common to ourselves and humanity. The evil-working force
3154,VERDUN,of the enemy has broken itself against the heights around this old
3155,VERDUN,citadel as an angry sea breaks upon a granite rock. These heights have
3156,VERDUN,conquered the storm which threatened the world.
3157,VERDUN,
3158,VERDUN,"I am deeply moved when I tread this sacred soil, and I do not speak for"
3159,VERDUN,"myself alone. I bring you a tribute of the admiration of my country, of"
3160,VERDUN,the great Empire which I represent here. They bow with me before your
3161,VERDUN,"sacrifice and before your glory. Once again, for the defence of the"
3162,VERDUN,"great causes with which its very future is bound up, mankind turns to"
3163,VERDUN,"France. ""À la France! Aux hommes tombés sous Verdun!"""

4105,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,wise men keep watch on it and make allowances for it. There are some
4106,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,who are more concerned about ending the war than about winning it; and
4107,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"plans which lead to victory, if they prolong the conflict, have their"
4108,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"disapproval, and the people who are responsible for such plans have"
4109,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,their condemnation. Let us keep our eye steadily on the winning of the
4110,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"war. May I say let us keep both eyes? Some have a cast in their eye,"
4111,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"and while one eye is fixed truly on victory, the other is wandering"
4112,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,around to other issues or staring stonily at some pet or partisan
4113,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,project of their own. Beware of becoming cross-eyed! Keep both eyes on
4114,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,victory. Look neither to the right nor to the left. That is the way
4115,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,we shall win. If any one promotes national distrust or disunion at
4116,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"this hour, he is helping the enemy and hurting his native land. And it"
4117,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,makes no difference whether he is for or against the war. As a matter
4118,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"of fact, the hurt is deeper if he is for the war, because whatever the"
4119,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"pure pacifist says is discounted, and, as far as the war is concerned,"
4120,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,discredited.
4121,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,
4122,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"Let there be one thought in every head. If you sow distrust,"
4123,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"discontent, disunion in the nation we shall reap defeat. If, on the"
4124,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"other hand, we sow the seeds of patience, confidence, and unity, we"
4125,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,shall garner in victory and its fruits. The last ridges of a climb
4126,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"are always the most trying to the nerves and to the heart, but the"
4127,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,real test of great endurance and courage is the last few hundreds or
4128,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,scores of feet in a climb upwards. The climber who turns back when
4129,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"he is almost there never becomes a great mountaineer, and the nation"
4130,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,that turns back and falters before it reaches its purpose never
4131,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"becomes a great people. You have all had experience in climbing,"
4132,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,no doubt--perhaps in Wales. Any mountaineer can start; any sort of
4133,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,mountaineer can go part of the way; and very often the poorer the
4134,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"mountaineer, the greater is his ardour when he does start; but fatigue"
4135,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,"and danger wear out all but the stoutest hearts, and even the most"
4136,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,stout-hearted sometimes fail when they come to the last slippery
4137,EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,precipice. But if they do turn back and afterwards look up and see how

4332,THE LIVING LINE,
4333,THE LIVING LINE,The greatest fight that ever yet
4334,THE LIVING LINE,Brought all the world to dearth;
4335,THE LIVING LINE,A fight of two great nations set
4336,THE LIVING LINE,To battle for the earth.
4337,THE LIVING LINE,
4338,THE LIVING LINE,And one was there with blood aflame
4339,THE LIVING LINE,To make the earth his tool;

4580,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",
4581,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","The situation is a serious one, and it is better for all peoples to"
4582,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",know the fact. Germany has struck four mighty blows with success on
4583,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","each occasion, and it is just a question of how many of these blows"
4584,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","we can stand. Personally, I think that the factor that can be turned"
4585,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","in our favour is this: If we stop and fight the Boche, we will kill"
4586,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","a sufficient number to make him silly, while America develops enough"
4587,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",strength to turn the man power in our favour. The British soldier
4588,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","realizes that he is a better man than the Boche, and he believes that"
4589,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",the German army can be beaten. Our men do not regard the Boche as a
4590,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","superman; and, remembering the crimes they have committed, we shall"
4591,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",never take such delight in killing them as when we next meet them.
4592,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","Germany is simply a mad dog that must be killed, a cancerous growth"
4593,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",that must be removed.
4594,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",
4595,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","I suppose that I am the proudest man in the British Isles to-night,"
4596,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",but I am not the happiest. I am the proudest man because I command the
4597,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",finest fighting force in all the Allied armies. An officer of Canadian
4598,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","birth, who has spent the whole of his military career with the British"
4599,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","Army, and married an English wife, told me the other day that he was"
4600,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","proud to be a Canadian, for everywhere he went men spoke of the deeds"
4601,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",of the Canadian Army Corps. When the women with their children and the
4602,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",old men were fleeing before enemy forces on the Western Front on a not
4603,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","very distant occasion, and learned that the troops meeting them were"
4604,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","Canadians, they turned round and went back home. On another occasion,"
4605,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","when visiting a British Headquarters, I saw a Brigadier sitting by"
4606,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","the roadside, tired, and dirty, and wan. He called out, ""Who's that"
4607,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","coming along?"" When the reply was, ""General Currie"", he said, ""Are the"
4608,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","Canadians coming down here?"" Told that they were, he threw his hat in"
4609,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","the air and declared, ""Then we are all right now""."
4610,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",
4611,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","When we came to England first, we were not regarded as the finest"
4612,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",fighting soldiers. We had many things said about us unjustly; and
4613,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",suggestions were put about that it was improbable we should ever become
4614,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","good soldiers. Everywhere to-day, at General Headquarters and all other"
4615,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","places, it is recognized that Canadian soldiers are fit to take their"
4616,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","place beside the veteran soldiers of the British Army, with whom we are"
4617,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",proud to serve.
4618,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",
4619,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",I know that it has been said that Canadians and other Overseas troops
4620,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",are placed in the hottest parts of the war area. The greatest fighting
4621,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","of the war has been this year, and we have not taken any particular"
4622,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",part in it. The Boche has not attacked the Canadian Front. He knows
4623,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",that he has never yet met the troops from Canada without suffering
4624,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",severely. The turn of the Canadian Corps must come. The temper of the
4625,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",Canadian soldier is that there is no position he is asked to take that
4626,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",he will not take; and I know that the Boche will not take any part of
4627,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","our line, except over the dead bodies of your Canadian fellow-citizens."
4628,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",That is why I am not the happiest man in the British Isles to-night.
4629,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",The Canadian Corps is going to die. It is simply a question of who can
4630,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",stand killing the longer.
4631,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",
4632,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",I have never seen the Corps in finer fighting fettle than it is to-day.
4633,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",The Canadians are now more efficient than ever; and we could not be in
4634,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",that position unless we were backed up by General Sir Richard Turner
4635,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",and his staff in England. There is a feeling of co-operation now that
4636,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",never existed before; and the better the liaison we have between
4637,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","France, England, and Canada, the better it is for the fighting forces."
4638,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",
4639,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918","And so we stand in a great cause, on the eve of great events. We have"
4640,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",to preserve the British Empire. It would be a terrible calamity if
4641,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",anything should happen that would make the peoples of the British
4642,"AUGUST OFFENSIVE, 1918",Empire hesitate at such a juncture. The British Empire must be saved.

4898,ON THE NAVY,"alike, full recognition of these facts. We are also entitled to"
4899,ON THE NAVY,"point out that this naval strength that we require, and which we"
4900,ON THE NAVY,"are determined to preserve, has never been used in modern history in"
4901,ON THE NAVY,"a selfish and aggressive manner, and that it has, on four separate"
4902,ON THE NAVY,"occasions, in four separate centuries--against Philip the Second of"
4903,ON THE NAVY,"Spain, Louis the Fourteenth, Napoleon, and the Kaiser--successfully"
4904,ON THE NAVY,"defended civilization from military tyranny, and particularly,"
4905,ON THE NAVY,preserved the independence of the Low Countries.
4906,ON THE NAVY,
4907,ON THE NAVY,"In this greatest of all wars, the British Navy shielded mighty America"
4908,ON THE NAVY,"from all menace of serious danger; and, when she resolved to act,"
4909,ON THE NAVY,it was the British Navy that transported and escorted the greater
4910,ON THE NAVY,proportion of her armies to the rescue and deliverance of France.
4911,ON THE NAVY,
4912,ON THE NAVY,Our record in a hundred years of unquestioned naval sway since
4913,ON THE NAVY,"Trafalgar, proves the sobriety of our policy and the righteousness"
4914,ON THE NAVY,of our intentions. Almost the only ports in the world open freely to
4915,ON THE NAVY,the commerce of all nations were those of our Island. Its possessions
4916,ON THE NAVY,and our coaling-stations were used freely and fully by ships of all
4917,ON THE NAVY,nations. We suppressed the slave trade. We put down piracy. We put it
4918,ON THE NAVY,"down again the other day. Even our coastwise traffic, so jealously"
4919,ON THE NAVY,"guarded by every Power in the world, was thrown open to all comers on"
4920,ON THE NAVY,"even terms, by that ancient people in whose keeping the world has been"
4921,ON THE NAVY,wisely ready to intrust the freedom of the seas.
4922,ON THE NAVY,
4923,ON THE NAVY,.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
4924,ON THE NAVY,
4925,ON THE NAVY,We are sincere advocates of a league of nations. Every influence
4926,ON THE NAVY,Britain can bring to bear will be used to make such a league a
4927,ON THE NAVY,powerful reality. This fine conception of President Wilson has been
4928,ON THE NAVY,warmly welcomed by British democracies all over the world. We shall
4929,ON THE NAVY,"strive faithfully and loyally to carry it into being, and keep it in"
4930,ON THE NAVY,active benefit and existence. But we must state quite frankly that a
4931,ON THE NAVY,league of nations cannot be for us a substitute for the British Navy in
4932,ON THE NAVY,any period that we can foresee.

4973,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"In proposing the health of President Poincaré, the King said:"
4974,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,
4975,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,It is difficult for me adequately to express the great pleasure that I
4976,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"feel in being your guest here to-night in this fair city of Paris, and"
4977,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,in the midst of the great nation with which during past years I and my
4978,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"people have mingled our sorrows and our joys, and are now triumphantly"
4979,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,crowned by overwhelming victory over the common enemy.
4980,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,
4981,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,We can all remember the repeated and desperate efforts made by the
4982,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"German armies to reach and capture this great capital; but, thanks to"
4983,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,the bravery of the splendid French Army and the loyal co-operation

4985,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"skilful direction and the strategy of the distinguished Marshal Foch,"
4986,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,the troops of the invader have been hurled across the frontier and
4987,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,compelled to sue for peace.
4988,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,
4989,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"Mr. President, I congratulate you and the noble French nation upon"
4990,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"the great victory that has been achieved, in which my generals and"
4991,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,armies are proud to have taken part. In the life and death conflict in
4992,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,which our nations have been together engaged for civilization and for
4993,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"right against the methods of barbarism and the forces of destruction,"
4994,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,the French and British peoples have learned in unity of purpose to

5000,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,
5001,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"Lastly, let me add one word of sympathy for those heroic Frenchmen and"
5002,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,French women who have suffered at the hands of the invader such as few
5003,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"have suffered, except in Belgium. And let us not forget the immortal"
5004,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"dead, whose names will ever be enshrined in one of the most glorious"
5005,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,pages of the history of the world.
5006,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,
5007,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,My soldiers have fought during all these years of relentless war side
5008,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"by side with the soldiers of France, whose valiant deeds have added"
5009,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,fresh lustre to their immortal traditions. The sailors of our two
5010,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,"navies have, together, kept these as in a comradeship and mutual trust"
5011,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,which the length of the war itself has only served more and more to
5012,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,foster and strengthen.
5013,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,
5014,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,With all my heart I thank you for your friendly feelings and the
5015,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,terms in which you have proposed my health. Accept also my cordial
5016,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,thanks for your generous hospitality and for the opportunity which you
5017,KING GEORGE IN PARIS,have afforded me in these ever memorable days of victory to pay my

5252,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,is the fact that none of the peoples of whom you are the delegates
5253,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,has had any part in the injustice. Humanity can place confidence in
5254,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,you because you are not among those who have outraged the rights of
5255,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,humanity.
5256,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,
5257,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,There is no need for further information or for special inquiries into
5258,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"the origin of the drama which has just shaken the world. The truth,"
5259,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"bathed in blood, has already escaped from the Imperial archives. The"
5260,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,premeditated character of the trap is to-day clearly proved.
5261,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,
5262,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"In the hope of conquering, first, the hegemony of Europe, and next, the"
5263,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"mastery of the world, the Central Empires, bound together by a secret"
5264,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"plot, found the most abominable of pretexts for trying to crush Serbia"
5265,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,and force their way to the East. At the same time they disowned the
5266,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,most solemn undertakings in order to crush Belgium and force their way
5267,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,into the heart of France.
5268,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,
5269,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,These are the two unforgettable outrages which opened the way to
5270,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"aggression. The combined efforts of Great Britain, France, and Russia"
5271,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,were exerted against that man-made arrogance.
5272,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,
5273,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"Your nations entered the war successively, but came one and all to the"
5274,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"help of threatened right. Like Germany, Great Britain had guaranteed"
5275,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,the independence of Belgium. Germany sought to crush Belgium. Great
5276,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,Britain and France both swore to save her. Thus from the very beginning
5277,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,of hostilities there came into conflict the two ideas which for fifty
5278,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,months were to struggle for the domination of the world--the idea of
5279,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"sovereign force, which accepts neither control nor check, and the idea"
5280,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"of justice, which depends on the sword only to prevent or repress the"
5281,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,abuse of strength.
5282,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,
5283,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"Faithfully supported by her dominions and colonies, Great Britain"
5284,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,decided that she could not remain aloof from a struggle in which the
5285,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"fate of every country was involved. She has made, and her dominions and"
5286,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"colonies have made with her, prodigious efforts to prevent the war from"
5287,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,ending in a triumph for the spirit of conquest and destruction of right.

5293,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,judgment passed at the bar of history by the lofty conscience of a free
5294,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,"people, and their chief magistrate, on the enormous responsibilities"
5295,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,incurred in the frightful conduct which was lacerating humanity. It
5296,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,was not only to protect themselves from the audacious aims of German
5297,PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE,megalomania that the United States equipped fleets and created immense
