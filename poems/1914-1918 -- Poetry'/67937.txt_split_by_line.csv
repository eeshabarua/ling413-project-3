64,INTRODUCTION,
65,INTRODUCTION,THE SONG OF TIADATHA first made its appearance in the columns of _The
66,INTRODUCTION,"Orient Weekly_, and by the time two or three instalments had appeared"
67,INTRODUCTION,requests came from every quarter asking that the fascinating story of
68,INTRODUCTION,"“Tired Arthur” should be completed as soon as possible, and issued in"
69,INTRODUCTION,book form for the further delight of its many admirers. This was easier
70,INTRODUCTION,asked for than complied with. All sorts of urgent messages were sent
71,INTRODUCTION,"to the Author, insisting on the fame that was awaiting him, but he was"
72,INTRODUCTION,"extremely busy with his military duties up on the Doiran Front, and"
73,INTRODUCTION,in the intervals of raiding the Bulgars his serio-comic muse did not
74,INTRODUCTION,flourish too easily.
75,INTRODUCTION,
76,INTRODUCTION,"But bit by bit the pleasing fabric of THE SONG OF TIADATHA was built up,"
77,INTRODUCTION,and we are happy to be able to present it at last in complete form. THE
78,INTRODUCTION,SONG OF TIADATHA is unique in war literature. It tells a story which
79,INTRODUCTION,"is common to very many members of the Salonica Army, and tells it in"
80,INTRODUCTION,"a fashion which is a most happy blend of descriptive realism, humour"
81,INTRODUCTION,"and sentiment. Longfellow’s metre has often been copied before, but I"
82,INTRODUCTION,think never so well as this and certainly never with such happy results.
83,INTRODUCTION,"Floating as gently along as Hiawatha in his canoe, we follow Tiadatha’s"
84,INTRODUCTION,adventures from the day when he ceases to be a “nut” in St. James’s
85,INTRODUCTION,"Street, joins up, and goes to France; we come with him to Macedonia,"
86,INTRODUCTION,and accompany him as he does the hectic round of Salonica’s dubious
87,INTRODUCTION,amusements; watch him building his dug-out up on the Doiran Front; share
88,INTRODUCTION,his feverish activities during the nightmare experience of the Great
89,INTRODUCTION,"Fire; attack the frowning Bulgar mountains in his company; and finally,"
90,INTRODUCTION,"with much good work well done, go back to England with him on leave—and"
91,INTRODUCTION,look enviously on as he takes to his arms again his green-eyed Phyllis.
92,INTRODUCTION,
93,INTRODUCTION,There is something in THE SONG OF TIADATHA that all of us have
94,INTRODUCTION,experienced. That is one reason why it appeals so strongly to the B.S.F.
95,INTRODUCTION,But another reason is that THE SONG OF TIADATHA is something absolutely
96,INTRODUCTION,our own. Nobody can appreciate it to the full who has not belonged to the
97,INTRODUCTION,great family of the B.S.F. And as you men of that Army have had trials
98,INTRODUCTION,"which have been peculiarly your own, so it is right that you should have"
99,INTRODUCTION,a pleasure in which nobody outside the family can fully participate.

109,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,"As Mr. H. C. Owen (the Editor of the _Balkan News_) says above, THE"
110,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,SONG OF TIADATHA tells a story which is common to very many members of
111,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,the Salonica Army; he says further that “nobody can appreciate it to
112,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,the full who has not belonged to the great family of the B.S.F.” But we
113,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,venture to think that it is a story which cannot properly be regarded
114,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,as of local significance and interest merely. It typifies experiences
115,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,"which innumerable soldiers must, in their various ways, have undergone"
116,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,throughout the various theatres of the war. Thus THE SONG OF TIADATHA may
117,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,"be regarded in a sense as a little epic of the Great War, and, though it"
118,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,"may find special appreciation among the great family of the B.S.F., its"
119,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,qualities are such that it may be expected to find appreciation among the
120,PUBLISHERS’ NOTE TO THE FIRST BRITISH EDITION,"great family of readers generally, soldiers and civilians alike."

184,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"I should answer, I should tell you,"
185,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"He was what we call a filbert,"
186,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Youth of two and twenty summers.
187,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,You could see him any morning
188,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"In July of 1914,"
189,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Strolling slowly down St. James’s
190,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,From his comfy flat in Duke Street.
191,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Little recked he of in those days,"
192,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Save of socks and ties and hair-wash,"
193,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Girls and motor-cars and suppers;
194,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Little suppers at the Carlton,"
195,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Little teas at Rumpelmeyer’s,"
196,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Little week-ends down at Skindle’s;
197,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Troc and Cri and Murray’s knew him,"
198,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"And the Piccadilly grill-room,"
199,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,And he used to dance at Ciro’s
200,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,With the fairies from the chorus.
201,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,There were many Tired Arthurs
202,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,In July of 1914.
203,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,
204,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Then came war, and Tiadatha"
205,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Read his papers every morning,"
206,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Read the posters on the hoardings,"
207,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Read “Your King and Country want you.”
208,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"“I must go,” said Tiadatha,"
209,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Toying with his devilled kidneys,"
210,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,“Do my bit and join the Army.”
211,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"So he hunted up a great-aunt,"
212,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Who knew someone in the Service,"
213,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Found himself in time gazetted
214,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,To a temporary commission
215,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,In the 14th Royal Dudshires.
216,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,
217,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Straightway Tiadatha hied him
218,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"To the shop of Bope and Pradley,"
219,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Having seen their thrilling adverts.
220,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,In the Tube and in the _Tatler_.
221,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Pradley sold him all he needed,"
222,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Bope a lot of things he didn’t,"
223,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Pressed upon him socks and puttees,"
224,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Haversacks and water-bottles.
225,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Made him tunics for the winter,"
226,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Made him tunics for the summer,"
227,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,And some very baggy breeches.
228,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"There he chose his cap of khaki,"
229,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Very light and very floppy
230,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"(Rather like a tam-o’-shanter),"
231,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"And a supple chestnut Sam Browne,"
232,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Quite a pleasant thing in Sam Brownes,"
233,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Rather new but very supple.
234,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,
235,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Many pounds spent Tiadatha
236,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"On valises, baths and camp beds,"
237,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Spent on wash-hand stands and kit bags.
238,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Macs and British warms and great-coats,"
239,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,And a gent’s complete revolver.
240,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Then he went to Piccadilly,"
241,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Mr. Wing, of Piccadilly,"
242,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Where he ordered ties and shirtings,"
243,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Cream and coffee ties and shirtings,"
244,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Ordered socks and underclothing,"
245,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Putting down the lot to Father.
246,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Compass, torch and boots and glasses"
247,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,All of these sought Tiadatha;
248,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,All day boys with loads were streaming
249,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"To and from the flat in Duke Street,"
250,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Like a chain of ants hard at it
251,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Storing rations for the winter.
252,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,
253,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"“One thing more,” cried Tiadatha,"
254,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,“One thing more ere I am perfect.
255,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,I must have a sword to carry
256,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,In a jolly leather scabbard.”
257,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"So he called the son of Wilkin,"
258,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Wilkin’s son who dwelt in Pall Mall,"
259,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Bade him make a sword and scabbard.
260,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,And the mighty son of Wilkin
261,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Made a sword for Tiadatha,"
262,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"From the truest steel he made it,"
263,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Slim and slender as a maiden,"
264,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Sharper than a safety razor,"
265,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Sighed a little as he made it,"
266,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Knowing well that Tiadatha
267,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Probably would never use it.
268,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,
269,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Then at last my Tiadatha
270,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Sallied forth to join the Dudshires,"
271,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Dressed in khaki, quite a soldier,"
272,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Floppy cap and baggy breeches,"
273,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Round his waist the supple Sam Browne,"
274,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"At his side the sword and scabbard,"
275,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Took salutes from private soldiers
276,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,And saluted Sergeant-Majors
277,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"(Who were very much embarrassed),"
278,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,And reported at Headquarters
279,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Of the 14th Royal Dudshires.
280,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Shady waters of a river,"
281,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Feels when by some turn of fortune
282,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,He gets plopped into a cistern
283,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"At a comic dime museum,"
284,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Finds himself among strange fishes,"
285,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Finds his happy freedom vanished,"
286,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Even so felt Tiadatha
287,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,On the day he joined the Dudshires.
288,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"But he pulled himself together,"
289,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Found the Adjutant, saluted,"
290,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,"Saying briefly, “Please I’ve come, sir.”"
291,THE JOINING OF TIADATHA,Such was Tiadatha’s joining.

332,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"“Mine’s the only way it’s done, sir,"
333,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Mine’s the way the Colonel wants it.”
334,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"“Narrow minds,” cried Tiadatha,"
335,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"“Hidebound hearts,” he cried in dudgeon,"
336,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"“Mine’s as good a way as his is,"
337,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Mine is better than the Colonel’s.
338,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"I shall tell him so to-morrow,"
339,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Tell him on parade to-morrow.”
340,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,
341,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"On the morrow came the Colonel,"
342,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Came the Colonel of the Dudshires,"
343,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Stern and terrible in aspect,"
344,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,With his usual morning liver;
345,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Ran his eye along the front rank,"
346,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Ran his eye along the rear rank,"
347,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Till he came to Tiadatha.
348,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"“There’s an officer,” he shouted,"
349,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Bellowed forth in voice of thunder,"
350,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,“Holding up his blasted rifle
351,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Like a something something pitchfork.”
352,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,After which poor Tiadatha
353,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Thought perhaps he wouldn’t mention
354,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Forming fours and simpler methods.
355,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,
356,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Had you asked my Tiadatha
357,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"If he loved those days of training,"
358,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Loved the sloping arms by numbers,"
359,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Loved the musketry and marching,"
360,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"And the press-ups and the shouting,"
361,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,He would just have smiled and told you
362,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"That, until he joined the Army,"
363,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,He had not the least conception
364,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Life could be so damned unpleasant.
365,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"But it made him much less nut-like,"
366,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Made him straighter-backed and broader,"
367,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Clear of eye, with muscles on him"
368,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Like a strong man in a circus.
369,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,
370,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,And in time he formed new friendships
371,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,With his brothers in the Dudshires.
372,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"They were drawn from many countries,"
373,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Many places and professions,"
374,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"From the public schools of England,"
375,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"From Ceylon and from Rhodesia,"
376,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Canada, the Coast and China;"
377,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Actors, business men and lawyers,"
378,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,And a planter from Malacca
379,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,With a mighty thirst for whisky.
380,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,As a village shop in Dudshire
381,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Has its wonderful collection,"
382,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Miscellaneous assortment
383,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Of all things that you could think of,"
384,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,And a lot of things you couldn’t—
385,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Oranges and postal orders,"
386,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Bullseyes, buckets, belts and bacon,"
387,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Shoes and soap and writing-paper—
388,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Even such a strange collection
389,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Tiadatha found his brothers
390,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,In the 14th Royal Dudshires.
391,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Yet they fitted in their places
392,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Like the pieces of a puzzle,"
393,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Pieces of a jig-saw puzzle,"
394,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"And they talked on common topics,"
395,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Motor-bikes and leave and press-ups.
396,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,So among them Tiadatha
397,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Lived and laughed and learnt and grumbled,"
398,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Shared their tents and huts and billets,"
399,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Shared the mud and snow and sunshine,"
400,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Shared the long route marches with them,"
401,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,And at night foregathered with them
402,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Over port and whisky sodas.
403,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,
404,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Came a day when Tiadatha
405,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Handed in at last his rifle,"
406,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"And as a Platoon Commander,"
407,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Found out what commanders feel like
408,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,(Sort of super-idiot feeling)
409,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"When they shout “Right Turn” for “Left Turn,”"
410,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,When they loudly bawl out “Eyes Left”
411,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,For a General on their right hand.
412,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Daily too upon parade he
413,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Looked at his platoon’s cap badges,"
414,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Saw its every button polished,"
415,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Learnt that private soldiers’ hair grows
416,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Fast as cress upon a blanket.
417,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Many hours he spent in drilling,"
418,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"Spent in Foot and Kit inspections,"
419,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Spent in strenuous Brigade Days
420,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,"On the windy downs of Dudshire,"
421,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Finding (as he’d long suspected)
422,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,That a subaltern’s existence
423,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Isn’t quite all beer and skittles.
424,THE TRAINING OF TIADATHA,Such was Tiadatha’s training.

431,TIADATHA’S WOOING,TIADATHA’S WOOING
432,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
433,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
434,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"During all the months of training,"
435,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Months of waiting down in Dudshire,"
436,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Often sighed my Tiadatha
437,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"For his haunts about St. James’s,"
438,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Missed his little flat in Duke Street,"
439,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Missed his morning devilled kidneys.
440,TIADATHA’S WOOING,But at times he snatched a week-end
441,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"From the joys of bombs and bayonets,"
442,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Put his name down in the leave book
443,TIADATHA’S WOOING,And went crashing up to London.
444,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
445,TIADATHA’S WOOING,In the East they tell a legend
446,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Of the crocodiles that dwell there,"
447,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Basking in the tropic sunshine
448,TIADATHA’S WOOING,On the mudflats of the rivers.
449,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Every night (so natives tell you)
450,TIADATHA’S WOOING,All the crocodiles will vanish
451,TIADATHA’S WOOING,To the palace of their rajah
452,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Underneath the winding rivers;
453,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"There each crocodile his skin doffs,"
454,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Hangs it in the palace courtyard
455,TIADATHA’S WOOING,And becomes a human being.
456,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
457,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Even so my Tiadatha
458,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Doffed his tunic for those week-ends,"
459,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Hung his soldier’s mental skin up,"
460,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Put off thoughts of bomb and bayonet,"
461,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Turning to the haunts that knew him
462,TIADATHA’S WOOING,In July of 1914.
463,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
464,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Thus fared he through months of waiting
465,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Till at last there came the tidings:
466,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"“We go out to France in three weeks,"
467,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Final leave begins on Friday.”
468,TIADATHA’S WOOING,So it chanced that Tiadatha
469,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Spent his final leave in London,"
470,TIADATHA’S WOOING,And one night looked in at Murray’s
471,TIADATHA’S WOOING,With a brother from the Dudshires.
472,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"“I have got to meet my sister,”"
473,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Said his brother from the Dudshires,"
474,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"“Meet my little sister Phyllis,"
475,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Come and dance a fox-trot with her.”
476,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
477,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Rather bored felt Tiadatha,"
478,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Thinking how he’d asked to supper
479,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Cloe Goldilocks of Daly’s,"
480,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Bored until he saw this Phyllis,"
481,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Heard his friend say, “Here’s my sister;"
482,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Phyllis, this is Tiadatha.”"
483,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
484,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Fair was she and slim and slender,"
485,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Like an April day her eyes were,"
486,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Green and grey as days in April.
487,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"And her mouth curved like a rose leaf,"
488,TIADATHA’S WOOING,And her smile was like the sunshine
489,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Playing on the Thames at Chelsea
490,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Early on a summer morning.
491,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Slim and slender as his sword was.
492,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
493,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Tiadatha looked and wondered,"
494,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Found her different from the others,"
495,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Asked her if she’d dance the next one,"
496,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Vowed he’d dodge the gilt-haired Cloe;
497,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Then the band struck up a rag-time,"
498,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Noisy, thrilling, banging rag-time,"
499,TIADATHA’S WOOING,And he steered her through the mazes
500,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Of that crowded floor at Murray’s.
501,TIADATHA’S WOOING,In and out among the couples
502,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Tightly in his arms he bore her
503,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"(Very careful not to bump her),"
504,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Dipping, whirling, swinging, swaying,"
505,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"To the rhythm of the music,"
506,TIADATHA’S WOOING,To that syncopated music
507,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Of the darkie band at Murray’s.
508,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
509,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Then they supped and danced a fox-trot,"
510,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Careless, fascinating fox-trot,"
511,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Danced a waltz, another rag-time;"
512,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Till the darkie band departed,"
513,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Till the waiters all grew restive
514,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Phyllis danced with Tiadatha.
515,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Brother Bill had hied him homewards
516,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Rather peevish, very sleepy,"
517,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Saying “See her home to Sloane Street,”"
518,TIADATHA’S WOOING,To the joy of Tiadatha.
519,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
520,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"So he put her in a taxi,"
521,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Saying to the driver gently,"
522,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"“No, old top, not straight to Sloane Street,”"
523,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Hopped in too and looked at Phyllis,"
524,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Found his heart was working faster
525,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Than a Lewis gun in action.
526,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
527,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Very lovely was the morning
528,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"As they drove down Piccadilly,"
529,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Pink and grey like parrots’ feathers;
530,TIADATHA’S WOOING,And the watered streets were gleaming
531,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Still and silent in the sunlight,"
532,TIADATHA’S WOOING,None abroad and nothing stirring
533,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Save a sparrow in the Green Park,"
534,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Save a reveller returning;
535,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Save a loaded wagon bearing
536,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Brussels sprouts to Covent Garden.
537,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
538,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"“Phyllis, dear,” said Tiadatha,"
539,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"“No one ever danced like you do,"
540,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"No one ever smiled like you do,"
541,TIADATHA’S WOOING,No one ever made my heart beat
542,TIADATHA’S WOOING,In the way that you have made it.
543,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Fate is cruel to let me find you
544,TIADATHA’S WOOING,On this last of final leave days.”
545,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
546,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Phyllis sighed and whispered softly,"
547,TIADATHA’S WOOING,“Better to have found each other
548,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Even for a little hour.
549,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"All the same, I hate you going;"
550,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"I shall miss you, Tiadatha.”"
551,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
552,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"“Some day I will come back, Phyllis,"
553,TIADATHA’S WOOING,We will dance again together.
554,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Will you be my partner always,"
555,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Will you wait, my lovely Phyllis?”"
556,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Not a word she answered, only"
557,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Moved her hand in his a little,"
558,TIADATHA’S WOOING,And straightway my Tiadatha
559,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Took her in his arms and kissed her.
560,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
561,TIADATHA’S WOOING,*       *       *       *       *
562,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
563,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"“’Ere we are, sir,” said the driver."
564,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"“Bin ’ere this last twenty minutes,”"
565,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Growled the driver of the taxi,"
566,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Rather anxious for his breakfast.
567,TIADATHA’S WOOING,So they parted; Tiadatha
568,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Watched the front door close behind her,"
569,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Gave the driver half-a-sovereign,"
570,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Strolled back slowly to St. James!
571,TIADATHA’S WOOING,
572,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Thus was Tiadatha’s wooing,"
573,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Thus he parted from his Phyllis.
574,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"You will say ’twas not idyllic,"
575,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Wooing in a London taxi,"
576,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Parting on a London pavement.
577,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Yet romance is where your heart is
578,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Idylls what you like to make them.
579,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Anyone can be romantic
580,TIADATHA’S WOOING,In a punt beneath the willows;
581,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Anyone can be romantic
582,TIADATHA’S WOOING,In a woodland dell at sunset.
583,TIADATHA’S WOOING,But if punt and dell are absent
584,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"And you want to tell your Phyllis,"
585,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Want to tell her how you love her,"
586,TIADATHA’S WOOING,"Be a man like Tiadatha,"
587,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Take her in your arms and tell her
588,TIADATHA’S WOOING,Even in a London taxi.
589,TIADATHA’S WOOING,

597,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,
598,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"On a day in late September,"
599,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"In September 1915,"
600,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Marched the 14th Royal Dudshires
601,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"For the last time past their General,"
602,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Ere they sailed to fight the Germans.
603,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,After which my Tiadatha
604,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Sorted out the things he needed,"
605,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"All the things he thought he needed,"
606,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"For a life on active service,"
607,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Active service in the trenches.
608,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,
609,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"“Thirty-five pounds, Tiadatha,”"
610,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Said his Company Commander,"
611,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Sitting on a mighty bundle,"
612,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"“Not another ounce, remember.”"
613,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"“Thirty-five pounds,” said the T.O."
614,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"“Not another ounce, remember,"
615,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Or I put the whole darned lot off.”
616,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"All day long he heard their warnings,"
617,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"In his dreams he heard their warnings,"
618,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"“Thirty-five pounds, Tiadatha.”"
619,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,
620,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Ruefully he left behind him
621,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Presents from his fond relations—
622,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Cooking stoves and writing cases,"
623,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Body shields and balaclavas,"
624,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Medicine chests and many mittens,"
625,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Also twenty-seven mufflers
626,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Knitted by some loving cousins,"
627,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,And a vast supply of Horlick’s.
628,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,
629,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Even then it looked too bulky,"
630,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"That valise of Tiadatha’s,"
631,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Very big and fat and bulging,"
632,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Though he’d only crammed inside it
633,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Just the barest necessaries
634,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,For a life on active service—
635,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"And a pair of silk pyjamas,"
636,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Just one pair of pink pyjamas,"
637,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Souvenirs of Piccadilly.
638,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,
639,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Then he helped his batman raise it,"
640,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Watched his batman stagger with it
641,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,To the laden limbered wagon.
642,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"“Much too heavy,” said the T.O."
643,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Pointing an accusing finger.
644,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,“Did I not say thirty-five pounds?
645,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,This is over sixty-seven.”
646,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,
647,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,So they took it round the corner
648,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"(Tiadatha and his batman),"
649,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,And with superhuman efforts
650,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Tightened up the straps a little,"
651,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Hoisted it upon the limber
652,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,When the T.O. wasn’t looking.
653,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,
654,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,On the next day Tiadatha
655,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Got his gent.’s complete equipment,"
656,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Messed about with straps and buckles,"
657,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Set upon it his revolver,"
658,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Ammunition-pouch and compass,"
659,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Stuffed the pack to overflowing,"
660,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"With some little things he couldn’t,"
661,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Really couldn’t leave behind him.
662,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Not a man in all the Dudshires
663,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Had a pack like Tiadatha’s;
664,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,When he put it on he tottered
665,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,As a very strong man totters
666,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Carrying a grand piano,"
667,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,As a railway porter totters
668,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Humping trunks of Yankee travellers.
669,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"“This is War,” said Tiadatha,"
670,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,As he went on the parade ground
671,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,For his final march in England.
672,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,
673,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Very cheerful were the Dudshires
674,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"As they swung along the high road,"
675,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Marching to the railway station,"
676,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Off to do a job for England,"
677,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Singing all the songs of those days,"
678,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Playing “Keep the Home Fires Burning”
679,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,On their fourpenny mouth-organs.
680,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,And the simple folk of Dudshire
681,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Turned out in their scores to see them,"
682,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Smiling through their tears they watched them.
683,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Standing in the cottage doorways,"
684,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Waving from the cottage windows.
685,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,As he sang each soldier wondered
686,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"How long it would be, before he"
687,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Saw again those smiling faces,"
688,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Little knowing how he’d miss them,"
689,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Sigh for all those smiling faces,"
690,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"For the sunny downs of Dudshire,"
691,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"For the mellow ale of Dudshire,"
692,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,In the days that were to follow.
693,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Then they reached the railway station,"
694,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Journeyed down by train to Folkestone,"
695,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,And embarked upon their transport
696,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,For the land of war and trenches.
697,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,
698,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Should you ask me of their sailing,"
699,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Ask me if the bands were playing,"
700,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Buglers blowing, bagpipes wailing,"
701,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Sirens tooting, people cheering,"
702,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,If the Quay were thronged with watchers
703,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Waving to their sons and husbands,"
704,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Blowing kisses to their sweethearts,"
705,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,And the soldiers on the troopship
706,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Lining all along the taffrail,"
707,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Singing loudly “Rule Britannia”
708,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"(You have very likely heard it,"
709,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"_The Departure of the Troopship_,"
710,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"On some gramophone or other),"
711,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,I should make reply and tell you.
712,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"There was not a band or bugle,"
713,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Not a single watcher waving,"
714,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Not a single soldier singing
715,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,On the night that Tiadatha
716,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Sailed for France upon a troopship.
717,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Silently they left the station,"
718,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Silently embarked at midnight,"
719,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"No one talking, no one smoking,"
720,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Not a sound except the tramping
721,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Of the men along the gangway,"
722,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"And the gurgling water-bottles,"
723,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,And the rattle of equipment.
724,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,
725,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Like a shadow lay the transport,"
726,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Like a ghost she cast her moorings,"
727,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,And with her destroyer escort
728,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Steamed away into the darkness.
729,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,
730,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"“Better thus,” mused Tiadatha,"
731,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,As he watched the inky outline
732,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Of the cliffs of England fading,"
733,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Thinking of his green-eyed Phyllis,"
734,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Thinking hard of Piccadilly,"
735,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Thinking of his loves and longings
736,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Set within the four-mile radius.
737,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"“Better thus,” thought Tiadatha,"
738,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Went below and had a whisky
739,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"With his Company Commander,"
740,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,"Made a pillow of his life-belt,"
741,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Fell into a troubled slumber
742,TIADATHA’S DEPARTURE,Till the shores of France were sighted.

750,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
751,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
752,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Tiadatha had a notion,"
753,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,All the Dudshires had a notion
754,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,That in France they’d drop for ever
755,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Musketry and long route marches,"
756,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Drop the sloping arms by numbers,"
757,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Drop the everlasting press-ups,"
758,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,As a steamer drops her pilot
759,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,When she reaches open waters.
760,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Yet the Dudshires’ recollection
761,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Of those days in France is mainly
762,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"One big blur of mingled P.T.,"
763,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Arm drill, long straight roads and marches."
764,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
765,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Many miles my Tiadatha
766,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Tramped along those endless highways.
767,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Endless as a winter’s evening,"
768,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Straighter than the wife of Cæsar,"
769,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Fringed with trees all apple-laden,"
770,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Apple-laden till the Dudshires
771,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Had a short fall-out beneath them.
772,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
773,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Many villages they came to,"
774,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Villages as like as marbles,"
775,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"With a little church, a duck pond,"
776,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"And a local pub, which furnished"
777,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Nothing in the world but _vin rouge_
778,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"(“Two _vins_, please, Miss,” called the Dudshires),"
779,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Beer as thin as tissue paper,"
780,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,And (sometimes) a drop of cognac:
781,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,There were bars in which the soldiers
782,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Slept on straw and ate and grumbled,"
783,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Shaved and smoked and wrote their letters—
784,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Tiadatha censored hundreds.
785,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,There were cottages that straggled
786,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,(Like some weary soldiers marching)
787,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Down a very muddy main street;
788,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"In those cottages dwelt old men,"
789,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Women, children and some cripples,"
790,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"But no men with able bodies,"
791,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Not a slacker, not a shirker."
792,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
793,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Here it was that Tiadatha
794,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Slept upon the chilly stone floor,"
795,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Or (if fate were feeling kinder)
796,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"On a mighty feather mattress,"
797,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Ate his dinner in the kitchen,"
798,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Drinking down great draughts of cider,"
799,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Talking in his very vile French
800,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"To Madame, his kindly hostess,"
801,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Wrinkled as a russet apple.
802,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"By the fire he wrote his letters,"
803,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Wrote and told his green-eyed Phyllis
804,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"How he missed her every minute,"
805,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Thanked her for the cake she’d sent him,"
806,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Hinted that he’d like another.
807,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
808,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Little dreamed my Tiadatha
809,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"How he’d miss the cottage kitchen,"
810,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Miss the long French loaves and butter,"
811,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"And his kindly wrinkled hostess,"
812,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,In the days that were to follow.
813,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
814,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"After several weeks of wandering,"
815,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"From one village to another,"
816,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"From one billet to another,"
817,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Came a sojourn in the trenches
818,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Just to see what trenches feel like.
819,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
820,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,On the day that Tiadatha
821,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Sallied forth into the trenches,"
822,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Wondrously was he accoutred.
823,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,On his head a cap with ear-flaps
824,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"(Very like a third-rate footpad’s),"
825,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"On his feet a pair of waders,"
826,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Reaching upwards to his tummy.
827,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Many bags of tricks he carried,"
828,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Compass, map case and revolver,"
829,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Respirator, two trench daggers,"
830,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"And his pack was great with torches,"
831,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Tommy’s cookers, iron rations,"
832,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"And a box of ear defenders,"
833,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Present from his Aunt Matilda.
834,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
835,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"As they saw him in the distance,"
836,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Bearing down upon their billets,"
837,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"His platoon turned out in wonder,"
838,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Watched the apparition coming,"
839,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Speculated who it might be,"
840,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Freely making bets about it,"
841,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Till they found it was none other
842,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Than their own platoon commander.
843,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
844,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Then he trudged off to the trenches,"
845,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Followed many muddy C.T.s,"
846,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Till at last he reached a dug-out,"
847,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,And “reported for instruction”
848,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,To the hero who commanded
849,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,That small sector of the trenches.
850,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,This stout hero and his fellows
851,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Made my Tiadatha welcome,"
852,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Straightway plying him with whisky,"
853,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Saying, “Won’t you take your kit off?"
854,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,All you’ll need up here’s a Sam Browne.”
855,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
856,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Then his host expounded to him
857,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Many mysteries of warfare,"
858,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"And the routine of the trenches,"
859,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,All the habits of the Boche cove.
860,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"All the Boche’s beastly habits,"
861,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"When he crumped, and when he didn’t,"
862,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,How you got retaliation;
863,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Spoke of Véry lights and whizzbangs,"
864,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Lewis guns and working parties,"
865,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Of his leave, due Friday fortnight,"
866,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Of the foibles of his Colonel,"
867,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Of the rats that he had captured
868,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,With some cheese upon a bayonet.
869,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
870,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Then they took him round their trenches,"
871,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Round their muddy maze of trenches,"
872,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Rather like an aggravated
873,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Rabbit warren with the roof off,"
874,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Worse to find one’s way about in
875,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Than the dark and windy subways
876,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Of the Piccadilly tube are.
877,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
878,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,In the day and night that followed
879,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Many things learnt Tiadatha
880,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Of the subtleties of trench-craft.
881,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Learnt of crumps and duds and shrapnel,"
882,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"And enjoyed himself immensely,"
883,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Little knowing how he’d loathe crumps
884,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,When he got to know them better.
885,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
886,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,There are very many trials
887,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,That a soldier can get used to:
888,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Senior officers and bully,"
889,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Dug-outs, mules and ration biscuits,"
890,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Even standing-to in trenches
891,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,At some God-forsaken hour
892,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"On a cold and rainy morning,"
893,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,But a crump is one of those things
894,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"That you never quite get used to,"
895,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"And the longer that you know them,"
896,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Usually the less you like them.
897,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Crumps are like the gilt-haired fairies
898,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,(Very swift and rather thrilling)
899,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Tiadatha played about with
900,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,In the days he was a filbert—
901,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Quite amusing when you meet them
902,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"Once or twice or even three times,"
903,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Who become a little trying
904,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,When they all turn up to supper
905,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Regularly every evening.
906,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,
907,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,But in those days Tiadatha
908,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Didn’t mind the crumps a little.
909,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Laughed to hear them rustling over
910,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"All the time that he was shaving,"
911,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,Laughed to see a couple bursting
912,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,"In a traverse near his dug-out,"
913,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,As he laughed at Cloe’s sallies
914,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,On the day when first he met her
915,TIADATHA IN FRANCE,In her dressing-room at Daly’s.

923,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,
924,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,
925,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,As the Dudshires were preparing
926,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"For a winter in the trenches,"
927,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Just as they were getting settled
928,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"In their sector of the trenches,"
929,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Came an order for their moving
930,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,To an unknown destination—
931,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Sudden as a German flare-light
932,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"To a midnight working party,"
933,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Unexpected as a kidney
934,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,To a quartermaster-sergeant.
935,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,There were many speculations
936,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"As to what was going to happen,"
937,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Many arguments about it,"
938,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Many wagers laid about it,"
939,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Many strange unholy rumours.
940,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,
941,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,In the mighty British Army
942,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Rumour is the only issue
943,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,That arrives at units larger
944,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Than it leaves the Base Supply Park.
945,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Up it comes without an indent
946,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"(Possibly in lieu of lime-juice),"
947,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Heaven only knows its maker;
948,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Like a toy balloon it swells up,"
949,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Gently growing big and bigger;
950,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,At the Dump the Mr. Knowalls
951,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Have a blow to make it fatter,"
952,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Pass it on to Transport drivers,"
953,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Who in their turn puff their hardest,"
954,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Make it change its shape a little,"
955,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Hand it over with the rations.
956,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Then the minions of the Q.M.
957,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Do their little bit to help it,"
958,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,After which the Sergeant-Major
959,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Takes a lusty breath to fix it,"
960,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Sends it up into the trenches
961,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,As a full-blown Army rumour.
962,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,
963,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Fast and thick as flying fishes
964,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Rise and dive in the Pacific,"
965,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Rumours came and went in those days.
966,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Sending off the whole battalion
967,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"On a mission to the Aztecs,"
968,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"As town guard of Buenos Ayres,"
969,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Or to fight beside the Russians,"
970,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Or to sail for Salonica.
971,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"And the last seemed most fantastic,"
972,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Tiadatha laughed the loudest,"
973,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Laying 9 to 2 against it.
974,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,
975,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"After several days of waiting,"
976,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Being issued out with goatskins,"
977,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Issued out with leather jerkins
978,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"(Fuel to the rumour-mongers),"
979,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Came a very trying night march
980,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,To a dreary railway station.
981,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,
982,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,As they neared the railway station
983,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Rose before my Tiadatha
984,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Visions of a Pullman carriage,"
985,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Or at least a third-class smoker,"
986,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"And he called to mind the adage,"
987,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"“Third-class riding’s always better,"
988,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Better far than first-class walking.”
989,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Bitterly the Dudshires grumbled,"
990,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,When they found their third-class riding
991,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Was to be in old horse-boxes,"
992,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Squashed like figs and not so comfy:
993,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Thirty-nine at first were crammed in,"
994,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Then another and another,"
995,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Then a pile of army blankets,"
996,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Then their overcoats in bundles.
997,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,
998,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Tiadatha and his brothers
999,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Found themselves another horse-box,"
1000,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Got a little straw and spread it,"
1001,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Wrapped themselves up in their great-coats,"
1002,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Fell asleep with straw for mattress,"
1003,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Someone else’s boots for pillow.
1004,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,
1005,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Tiadatha often shuddered
1006,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Thinking of the days that followed,"
1007,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Of the days and nights that followed,"
1008,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,As that God-forsaken troop train
1009,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Rocked upon its journey southward.
1010,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,All his life will he remember
1011,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Turning out for tea at midnight
1012,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"In some dimly-lighted station,"
1013,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Shaving in acute discomfort,"
1014,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Washing when he got a chance to,"
1015,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Hotting up his ration bacon
1016,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"On a wobbly Tommy’s cooker,"
1017,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Passing by the weary hours
1018,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Playing little games of vingty,"
1019,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Losing one by one his chattels
1020,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"In the straw about the horse-box,"
1021,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"In the straw that buried all things,"
1022,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,In the straw that clung to all things.
1023,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,
1024,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"At Marseilles at last they halted,"
1025,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"And straightway my Tiadatha,"
1026,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Having stretched his legs a little,"
1027,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Found himself and all the Dudshires
1028,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Packed aboard a British cruiser;
1029,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Not a chance to see the beauties
1030,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Of that very ancient seaport,"
1031,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Not a chance to stop to dinner,"
1032,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Not a chance to try his hand at
1033,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Crime-committing after dinner.
1034,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,
1035,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Soon, however, Tiadatha"
1036,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Loathed the very thought of dinner
1037,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"At Marseilles or in the Ward Room,"
1038,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,As that cruiser started rolling
1039,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Through the heaving Gulf of Lyons.
1040,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"But there followed days of sunshine,"
1041,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Sea and sky as blue as Reckitt’s,"
1042,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"When he wished he’d joined the Navy,"
1043,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Wished he’d gone and been a sailor,"
1044,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,When his only care was wondering
1045,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,If he’d have another sherry.
1046,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"What a periscope would look like,"
1047,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Where on earth he’d left his life-belt,"
1048,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Wondering still where they were bound for,"
1049,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Egypt, Serbia, or Mespot:"
1050,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Till at last all bets were settled,"
1051,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"All the speculations answered,"
1052,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,As one day my Tiadatha
1053,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Came on deck and saw before him
1054,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,"Salonica, white and lovely,"
1055,TIADATHA’S JOURNEY,Gleaming in the morning sunlight.

1065,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,On the day the Royal Dudshires
1066,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Set their foot in Salonica,"
1067,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Nobody seemed pleased to see them,"
1068,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,No one worried much about them.
1069,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"M.L.O.s were apathetic,"
1070,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Not a bit enthusiastic,"
1071,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Like a hostess at a party
1072,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,When an uninvited guest comes.
1073,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,And the folk of Salonica
1074,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Did not come to bid them welcome,"
1075,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Did not hang out flags of welcome,"
1076,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Did not cry, “’Tis well, O brothers,"
1077,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,That ye come so far to see us.”
1078,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,(After all there was no reason
1079,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Why on earth they should have done so.)
1080,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,But they stood and watched the Dudshires
1081,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Marching through their ancient city,"
1082,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Slipping on their cobbled roadway,"
1083,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Giving “Eyes Left” to a Greek guard;
1084,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Stood and watched them from their doorways,"
1085,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Watched them through their grimy windows,"
1086,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Not a bit enthusiastic.
1087,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,
1088,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Many sights saw Tiadatha
1089,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"As he marched through Salonica,"
1090,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Cretan gendarmes with their long boots
1091,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"And their breakfasts in their breeches,"
1092,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,In their great black baggy breeches;
1093,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Turkish ladies clad in trousers;
1094,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Tattered hamals bending double
1095,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,With a load of fifty oil tins;
1096,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Many little limping donkeys,"
1097,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Little overladen donkeys,"
1098,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,As they crossed the Rue Egnatia
1099,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,(Where St. Paul in bygone ages
1100,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Used to do his bit of shopping).
1101,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Tiadatha thought of Kipling,"
1102,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Wondered if he’d ever been there,"
1103,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Thought “At least in Rue Egnatia
1104,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,East and West are met together.”
1105,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"There were trams and Turkish beggars,"
1106,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Mosques and minarets and churches,"
1107,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Turkish baths and dirty cafés,"
1108,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Picture palaces and kan-kans;
1109,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Daimler cars and Leyland lorries
1110,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Barging into buffalo wagons,"
1111,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,French and English private soldiers
1112,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Jostling seedy Eastern brigands.
1113,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,
1114,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,On a hill near Lembet Village
1115,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Came to rest the Royal Dudshires,"
1116,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"And their tents sprang up like toadstools,"
1117,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"All the camp was fixed by tea-time,"
1118,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,All were settled down by tea-time.
1119,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,
1120,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"There was nothing on that hillside,"
1121,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Not a tree or habitation,"
1122,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Save a little shanty standing
1123,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Like a palm tree in a desert—
1124,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,The Canteen of Back (Orosdi).
1125,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,There it was that Tiadatha
1126,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Tasted Greek beer for the first time,"
1127,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Made a frugal meal of walnuts,"
1128,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Figs and Turk’s delight and éclairs,"
1129,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Paid and found that he was living
1130,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Miles and miles beyond his income;
1131,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Found his little lunch had cost him
1132,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,More than if he’d been to Prince’s.
1133,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,
1134,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Rumour in these days was busy.
1135,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"They were going up to Serbia,"
1136,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,They were going off to Egypt;
1137,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Twenty thousand Greeks were ready
1138,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"(Rumour said) to down upon them,"
1139,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Scupper them within their flea-bags
1140,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"(Or, more pleasantly, intern them)."
1141,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Many hours spent Tiadatha
1142,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Wondering what was going to happen.
1143,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,
1144,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"All that happened was a blizzard,"
1145,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Not a private soldier blizzard
1146,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"With some Christmas cardy snowflakes,"
1147,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"But a perfect Balkan teaser,"
1148,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Sergeant-Major of a blizzard,"
1149,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Made of supersleet and hailstones,"
1150,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Every bitter wind of heaven
1151,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Massed together for the business.
1152,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,
1153,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,As a shade is to a candle
1154,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,So is Uncle Time to trouble:
1155,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Looking back we mostly find things
1156,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Not so bad as once we thought them.
1157,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Fifty Uncle Times, however,"
1158,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Could not shade for all who met it
1159,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Memories of that Balkan blizzard.
1160,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,
1161,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,And the wretched Tiadatha
1162,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Groaned to find his bucket frozen,"
1163,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Boots and even tooth-brush frozen,"
1164,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Regularly every morning;
1165,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Vainly tried to keep his feet warm,"
1166,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Crouching o’er a little oil-stove,"
1167,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Colder than New Zealand mutton,"
1168,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Colder than an ice-cream soda.
1169,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"And at intervals he murmured,"
1170,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,“How I hate this beastly country.”
1171,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"And the sergeants and the corporals,"
1172,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"And the luckless private soldiers,"
1173,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Murmured as the wind came sweeping,"
1174,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,“How I hate this blinkin’ country.”
1175,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Little then dreamed Tiadatha
1176,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Of the times those words would tremble
1177,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,On the lips of countless soldiers
1178,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"In the Salonica Army,"
1179,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Both in winter and in summer:
1180,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,“How I hate this blinkin’ country.”
1181,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,
1182,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"When the blizzard passed, the Dudshires"
1183,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Settled down to work in earnest:
1184,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,All day long obliging people
1185,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Found them jobs to keep them going.
1186,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Guards, fatigues and working parties,"
1187,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Roads to make and hills to dig on.
1188,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,All the livelong day the Dudshires
1189,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Spent in digging up the Balkans,"
1190,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Toiling at redoubts and trenches,"
1191,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Dug-outs, Lewis gun emplacements,"
1192,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Finding when the things were finished
1193,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Someone thought that they’d be better
1194,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Ten yards higher up the hillside,"
1195,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Ten yards lower down the hillside.
1196,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,
1197,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Then came strenuous Brigade Days,"
1198,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Ruining expensive breeches,"
1199,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Creepy-crawling over crest lines,"
1200,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Picketing some height or other,"
1201,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Getting lost at four pip emma,"
1202,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Fed-up, far from home, and hungry."
1203,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,
1204,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"So the weeks and months sped onward,"
1205,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Samey as suburban houses,"
1206,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Uneventful as a dud is,"
1207,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,"Till the winter turned to spring-time,"
1208,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Till the spring-time scattered flowers
1209,TIADATHA AT SALONICA,Like confetti on the hillsides.

1222,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Sidney Street and Champs-Elysée,"
1223,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"And the Appian Way and Wall Street,"
1224,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,But the Lembet Road will ever
1225,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Take a place in fame beside them,"
1226,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,While a single British soldier
1227,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Lives to tell of Salonica.
1228,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Mud and slush and bumps in winter,"
1229,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Bumps and dust and flies in summer.
1230,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Still, it’s filled out since we found it,"
1231,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Since we got to work upon it,"
1232,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,As a skinny baby fills out
1233,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,After being fed on Benger’s.
1234,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,
1235,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,There it was that Tiadatha
1236,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Learnt the gentle art of wangling
1237,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Lifts in cars and motor lorries
1238,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Down to Piccadilly Circus,"
1239,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,In the days before the Bulgar
1240,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Strolled into the Struma Valley.
1241,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,
1242,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"He would spend the morning shopping,"
1243,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Buying sundry brands of whisky
1244,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,(Mostly made by local effort)
1245,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,At the most prodigious prices;
1246,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,In his hob-nailed boots he slithered
1247,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Up and down Rue Venizelos,"
1248,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Buying mullet by the oke,"
1249,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Buying tangerines and chestnuts.
1250,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Shopkeepers would see him coming,"
1251,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Cry with glee, “Here’s Tiadatha,"
1252,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Plenty money, Tiadatha.”"
1253,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,
1254,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,After lunch at the Olympus
1255,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"(Prices higher than the mountain),"
1256,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Off he sped to Baths of Botton,"
1257,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Tasted once again the pleasures
1258,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Of a bath you can lie down in.
1259,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Though the soap was green and hardy,"
1260,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Though the towels weren’t all they might be,"
1261,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Even though the place was dirty,"
1262,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,It was better than a bucket.
1263,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Good and hot he made the water,"
1264,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Lay and splashed for half-an-hour,"
1265,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Whistling snatches of a rag-time.
1266,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,
1267,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Then of course he tea’d at Floca’s
1268,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Cosmopolitan as Shepheard’s,"
1269,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Ever full to overflowing.
1270,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,In those days there came to Floca’s
1271,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Officers of many armies,"
1272,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Officers of many navies,"
1273,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Mufti-wallahs of all nations.

1280,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Admirals, snotties and Commanders,"
1281,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Colonels, Generals and Captains,"
1282,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,And a few bold bad Lieutenants
1283,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Poodle-faking with some sisters.
1284,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Here they met and fed together,"
1285,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Drank their mastic, tea or absinthe,"
1286,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Talked their own peculiar language,"
1287,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Twenty tongues and yet one language:
1288,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"When they wanted their _addition_,"
1289,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Wanted their perspiring waiter,"
1290,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"They just clapped their hands together,"
1291,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Loudly clapped their hands together,"
1292,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Two or three or even four times.
1293,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"And in good time came the waiter,"
1294,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Dodging round the crowded tables,"
1295,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,As a cycling newsboy dodges
1296,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"In and out of London traffic,"
1297,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Added tip into the total,"
1298,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Just for fear they should forget it.
1299,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,
1300,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"After tea a bit more shopping,"
1301,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,And perhaps a Picture Palace
1302,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,(Fifteen suicides and murders
1303,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,In the space of half-an-hour).
1304,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Then he dined at Bastasini’s,"
1305,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Dined at the expensive Roma,"
1306,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,With his very best pal Percy;
1307,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Drank some pretty nasty bubbly,"
1308,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Sat and watched the other diners
1309,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Wrestling with their macaroni,"
1310,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Watched a livery Greek major
1311,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,(More and more and more impatient
1312,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,For the omelette he had ordered)
1313,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Break a plate upon the table,"
1314,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Dash one on the floor in pieces,"
1315,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Then another and another,"
1316,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Till the room was in an uproar,"
1317,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Till he’d got the whole staff round him.
1318,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"“Stout old heart,” cheered Tiadatha,"
1319,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"“Go it, Steve,” cheered Tiadatha,"
1320,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,“That’s the only way to do it
1321,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,If you’re really in a hurry.”
1322,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,
1323,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,After dinner off they sallied
1324,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,To the Odéon or Tour Blanche
1325,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"(Where you never paid but pushed past),"
1326,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Crowded in the nearest stage-box,"
1327,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Or if it was locked climbed over.
1328,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,
1329,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Had you asked my Tiadatha
1330,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"If the show was very thrilling,"
1331,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,If the lovely ladies sang him
1332,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Haunting songs of joy and sadness,"
1333,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,He’d have told you in a minute
1334,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,That he hadn’t time to notice.
1335,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,He was always much too busy
1336,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Shouting “Un, deux, trois” with Frenchmen,"
1337,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Drinking lager beer with Serbians,"
1338,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Swapping caps with ice-cream merchants,"

1342,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,With a boxful of the Navy;
1343,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Much too busy ragging Bertha,"
1344,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Andrée, Denisette or Dolly,"
1345,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Much too busy dodging Zizi,"
1346,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,When she clamoured “Champagne cider.”
1347,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"And when A.P.M.s came prowling,"
1348,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,He would disappear sedately
1349,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"With a beer mug in one pocket,"
1350,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"And a tin tray in the other,"
1351,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Finish up a noisy evening
1352,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"With a game of “Ring-a-roses,”"
1353,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Then jolt campwards in a gharry
1354,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,To valise and well-earned slumber.

1361,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Taught him by his lady mother,"
1362,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Do not fear one day to find him
1363,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Clapping hands at Rumpelmeyer’s
1364,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"For another chocolate éclair,"
1365,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Breaking plates and things at Prince’s
1366,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"When his lunch is long in coming,"
1367,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Looting beer mugs at the Palace
1368,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Or lassoing the conductor—
1369,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"He must do as Salonique does,"
1370,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,For there’s nothing else to do there.
1371,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,
1372,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Some there are find Salonica
1373,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Dirty, dull and evil-smelling."
1374,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Bored to tears, they sometimes ask you"
1375,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,What on earth there is to do there.
1376,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,But I make reply and tell them
1377,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Salonica’s what you make it.
1378,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,London can be just as boring
1379,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"As a dug-out in the trenches,"
1380,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Or a dug-out in the trenches
1381,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Can be merrier than Murray’s—
1382,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"If you’ve got the right coves in it,"
1383,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,"Got a little drop of whisky,"
1384,A DAY IN SALONIQUE,Other climes and other morals:

1427,UP THE LINE,"That would send them to the trenches,"
1428,UP THE LINE,"Take them from their desert island,"
1429,UP THE LINE,From their daily round of digging.
1430,UP THE LINE,"And at times there came a rumour,"
1431,UP THE LINE,Like a speck on the horizon.
1432,UP THE LINE,"Eagerly the Dudshires hailed it,"
1433,UP THE LINE,"Thought that it was going to save them,"
1434,UP THE LINE,But it always came to nothing.
1435,UP THE LINE,
1436,UP THE LINE,"So they sweltered through the summer,"
1437,UP THE LINE,"Through the arid Balkan summer,"
1438,UP THE LINE,"And the sun beat down upon them,"
1439,UP THE LINE,Hot as towels a Yankee barber
1440,UP THE LINE,Claps upon you when he’s shaved you.
1441,UP THE LINE,"They would rise at godless hours,"
1442,UP THE LINE,"Working in the dawn and evening,"
1443,UP THE LINE,And throughout the blazing daytime
1444,UP THE LINE,Lie inside their scorching bivvies
1445,UP THE LINE,On a barren Balkan hillside
1446,UP THE LINE,(Innocent of shade or cover
1447,UP THE LINE,"As a very bald man’s head is),"
1448,UP THE LINE,"Lie and curse the tepid water,"
1449,UP THE LINE,"Curse the flies and the mosquitoes,"
1450,UP THE LINE,"Till at last there came the order,"
1451,UP THE LINE,Secret order for their moving
1452,UP THE LINE,"To the front line and the trenches,"
1453,UP THE LINE,And in under twenty minutes
1454,UP THE LINE,Every soldier knew about it.
1455,UP THE LINE,
1456,UP THE LINE,"All was bustle and excitement,"
1457,UP THE LINE,"Packing up and getting ready,"
1458,UP THE LINE,And the T.O. and the Q.M.
1459,UP THE LINE,"Swore their lives were not worth living,"
1460,UP THE LINE,Swore they’d need at least another
1461,UP THE LINE,Fifty mules to move the regiment.
1462,UP THE LINE,And straightway my Tiadatha
1463,UP THE LINE,"Went and got his kit together,"
1464,UP THE LINE,"Did his utmost to reduce it,"
1465,UP THE LINE,"Threw away a pair of bedsocks,"
1466,UP THE LINE,"And a tie his aunt had sent him,"
1467,UP THE LINE,"Sighed to leave his bed behind him,"
1468,UP THE LINE,"Wrought by Private Woggs, his batman,"
1469,UP THE LINE,"Wrought from bits of ration boxes,"
1470,UP THE LINE,And a scrap of wire netting.
1471,UP THE LINE,
1472,UP THE LINE,"Then at last one summer evening,"
1473,UP THE LINE,"In July of 1916,"
1474,UP THE LINE,Tiadatha and the Dudshires
1475,UP THE LINE,"Started on their journey northward,"
1476,UP THE LINE,On their journey to the trenches;
1477,UP THE LINE,"Every night at dusk they started,"
1478,UP THE LINE,Marched with full packs through the darkness
1479,UP THE LINE,"(No one talking, no one smoking),"
1480,UP THE LINE,"Plodded onward through the darkness,"
1481,UP THE LINE,"And, perhaps at two ac emma,"
1482,UP THE LINE,"Reached a barren piece of waste land,"
1483,UP THE LINE,"Found their mules and fetched their blankets,"
1484,UP THE LINE,"Dossed down with the stars for ceiling,"
1485,UP THE LINE,Snatched a little sleep till daylight.
1486,UP THE LINE,"All the day they lay and simmered,"
1487,UP THE LINE,"Stuck a blanket up for shelter,"
1488,UP THE LINE,Spent the sultry morning thinking
1489,UP THE LINE,Of the things they would have given
1490,UP THE LINE,"For a long sweet draught of cold beer,"
1491,UP THE LINE,"Bass or Worthington or Allsopp,"
1492,UP THE LINE,In a long cool lager beer mug.
1493,UP THE LINE,"Sighed, and drank some tepid water,"
1494,UP THE LINE,"Ate some squishy-squashy bully,"
1495,UP THE LINE,Moist and warm and very nasty.
1496,UP THE LINE,
1497,UP THE LINE,For five nights and days the Dudshires
1498,UP THE LINE,"Fared upon their journey northward,"
1499,UP THE LINE,On the sixth they reached the front line
1500,UP THE LINE,"And relieved a French battalion,"
1501,UP THE LINE,"In a pelting, pouring rainstorm."
1502,UP THE LINE,
1503,UP THE LINE,As the guide led Tiadatha
1504,UP THE LINE,"On towards his destination,"
1505,UP THE LINE,To the section of the front line
1506,UP THE LINE,"He was ordered to take over,"
1507,UP THE LINE,Soon he found that all was different
1508,UP THE LINE,From the warfare he had known
1509,UP THE LINE,In the line near Bray and Albert.
1510,UP THE LINE,"He had pictured deep-dug trenches,"
1511,UP THE LINE,He had pictured winding C.T.s
1512,UP THE LINE,"Saps and mines and concrete dug-outs,"
1513,UP THE LINE,"Belts of wire as broad as rivers,"
1514,UP THE LINE,Bulgar posts within a bomb’s throw.
1515,UP THE LINE,But he found instead of trenches
1516,UP THE LINE,"Little scratchings on the hill-tops,"
1517,UP THE LINE,"Outposts scattered on the hill-tops,"
1518,UP THE LINE,"Reached by little winding pathways,"
1519,UP THE LINE,"Strands of wire forlornly dangling,"
1520,UP THE LINE,"Limp and spiritless and sketchy,"
1521,UP THE LINE,"As a stricken banjo’s strings are,"
1522,UP THE LINE,And instead of concrete dug-outs
1523,UP THE LINE,Leaky shelters made of oak-leaves
1524,UP THE LINE,Perched behind the barren hill-tops.
1525,UP THE LINE,
1526,UP THE LINE,There it was that Tiadatha
1527,UP THE LINE,"Found at length a French lieutenant,"
1528,UP THE LINE,"Picked up scraps of information,"
1529,UP THE LINE,"Talking in his very vile French,"
1530,UP THE LINE,"Learnt the methods of patrolling,"
1531,UP THE LINE,"Learnt the habits of the Bulgar,"
1532,UP THE LINE,"Learnt that he was three miles distant,"
1533,UP THE LINE,"Learnt of 535 his stronghold,"
1534,UP THE LINE,Crawling with O. Pips and field-guns.
1535,UP THE LINE,"Then they left the dim-lit _abri_,"
1536,UP THE LINE,"Staggered out into the darkness,"
1537,UP THE LINE,"Through the pelting, pouring rainstorm,"
1538,UP THE LINE,"Silently relieved the sentries,"
1539,UP THE LINE,"Posted all the Dudshire sentries,"
1540,UP THE LINE,"Whispered to them what their job was,"
1541,UP THE LINE,"What the number of their group was,"
1542,UP THE LINE,Where the groups on right and left were.
1543,UP THE LINE,Then the gallant French lieutenant
1544,UP THE LINE,"Gathered all his men together,"
1545,UP THE LINE,Left his little bits of trenches
1546,UP THE LINE,To the rain and Tiadatha.

1556,CARRYING ON,CARRYING ON
1557,CARRYING ON,
1558,CARRYING ON,
1559,CARRYING ON,There are very many lessons
1560,CARRYING ON,"Taught you by the British Army,"
1561,CARRYING ON,And when you have boiled the lot down
1562,CARRYING ON,Only two things really matter.
1563,CARRYING ON,"When you’ve learnt them you’re a soldier,"
1564,CARRYING ON,Till you have you’re still a duffer;
1565,CARRYING ON,"First to know your left from right hand,"
1566,CARRYING ON,Next to find your way in darkness—
1567,CARRYING ON,Both are passing hard to master.
1568,CARRYING ON,After nearly two years’ training
1569,CARRYING ON,Tiadatha could be trusted
1570,CARRYING ON,Not to go and bawl out “Eyes Right”
1571,CARRYING ON,"To a guard upon his left hand,"
1572,CARRYING ON,But to find his way in darkness
1573,CARRYING ON,Was a very different pigeon.
1574,CARRYING ON,
1575,CARRYING ON,If you lose your way in London
1576,CARRYING ON,"You can always ask a policeman,"
1577,CARRYING ON,"You can always hail a taxi,"
1578,CARRYING ON,But there were no taxis plying
1579,CARRYING ON,"From Baraka to Sidemli,"
1580,CARRYING ON,No policeman’s measured footfall
1581,CARRYING ON,’Twixt Les Batignolles and Clichy.
1582,CARRYING ON,Round about these pleasant places
1583,CARRYING ON,"Nightly Tiadatha staggered,"
1584,CARRYING ON,"Visiting his lonely outposts,"
1585,CARRYING ON,"Taking out a digging party,"
1586,CARRYING ON,Leading out patrols to Dautli.
1587,CARRYING ON,"Up and down the hills he stumbled,"
1588,CARRYING ON,"Crossing little winding _dere_,"
1589,CARRYING ON,"Falling into rocky gullies,"
1590,CARRYING ON,"Falling into blackberry bushes,"
1591,CARRYING ON,"Into unexpected shell holes,"
1592,CARRYING ON,Took wrong turnings in the darkness
1593,CARRYING ON,"(Hardly ever took the right one),"
1594,CARRYING ON,Lost his bearings far more often
1595,CARRYING ON,Than a woman loses hankies.
1596,CARRYING ON,"On patrol the Pitons knew him,"
1597,CARRYING ON,"Bekerli and Green Hill knew him,"
1598,CARRYING ON,And the minaret that rises
1599,CARRYING ON,From the ruins of Sidemli;
1600,CARRYING ON,Marching homewards in the daylight
1601,CARRYING ON,"Often he would stop to rest there,"
1602,CARRYING ON,Stop to gather fruit for dinner
1603,CARRYING ON,From the plum trees in the village;
1604,CARRYING ON,And one day he drove some Bulgars
1605,CARRYING ON,"From a little unnamed _piton_,"
1606,CARRYING ON,"Drove them off in wild confusion,"
1607,CARRYING ON,"Brought their rifles back in triumph,"
1608,CARRYING ON,"Brought a cap and water-bottle,"
1609,CARRYING ON,Brought some cheese they’d left behind them.
1610,CARRYING ON,"And the General named the _piton_,"
1611,CARRYING ON,"Called it after Tiadatha,"
1612,CARRYING ON,Called it Tiadatha’s Piton.
1613,CARRYING ON,
1614,CARRYING ON,Then one night the Royal Dudshires
1615,CARRYING ON,"Moved a little farther forward,"
1616,CARRYING ON,Pinched some hills and sat upon them;
1617,CARRYING ON,"Hurriedly they dug them trenches,"
1618,CARRYING ON,Put up rolls of concertina;
1619,CARRYING ON,And one afternoon in August
1620,CARRYING ON,(In the midst of crumps and shrapnel)
1621,CARRYING ON,Put to flight three thousand Bulgars
1622,CARRYING ON,Who had sallied forth to meet them.
1623,CARRYING ON,
1624,CARRYING ON,Several weeks my Tiadatha
1625,CARRYING ON,"Lived on sundry little hill-tops,"
1626,CARRYING ON,"Changing over every fortnight,"
1627,CARRYING ON,"Sleeping in a sketchy bivvy,"
1628,CARRYING ON,Sleeping with his boots and clothes on.
1629,CARRYING ON,"Just as he was getting settled,"
1630,CARRYING ON,"Had his trenches nearly finished,"
1631,CARRYING ON,"Promptly the battalion shifted,"
1632,CARRYING ON,"Marched for one night to the eastward,"
1633,CARRYING ON,"Then passed by the boundary pillar,"
1634,CARRYING ON,Passed the Serbian boundary pillar
1635,CARRYING ON,"On the road that leads to Doiran,"
1636,CARRYING ON,"Once again relieved their Allies,"
1637,CARRYING ON,"In the line that looked o’er Doiran,"
1638,CARRYING ON,In the line where Grand Couronné
1639,CARRYING ON,Frowned upon their every movement
1640,CARRYING ON,As the mighty 535 did:
1641,CARRYING ON,Loomed above them like the Great Wheel
1642,CARRYING ON,At the Earl’s Court Exhibition.
1643,CARRYING ON,
1644,CARRYING ON,There my tireless Tiadatha
1645,CARRYING ON,"Came one dark October evening,"
1646,CARRYING ON,"Found a certain Captain Siomme,"
1647,CARRYING ON,"Sitting in a dim-lit dug-out,"
1648,CARRYING ON,Pledged with him eternal friendship
1649,CARRYING ON,In a loving-cup of _vin rouge_.
1650,CARRYING ON,"Then said gallant Captain Siomme,"
1651,CARRYING ON,"“I will show you all the trenches,"
1652,CARRYING ON,"All the wire beyond the trenches,"
1653,CARRYING ON,"Show you where it wants repairing,"
1654,CARRYING ON,Show you also where the gaps are.”
1655,CARRYING ON,"Silently they crept towards it,"
1656,CARRYING ON,Siomme and my Tiadatha:
1657,CARRYING ON,"“_Silence!_” said the gallant Siomme,"
1658,CARRYING ON,"Lifting up a warning finger,"
1659,CARRYING ON,"Pursing up his lips in warning,"
1660,CARRYING ON,"“_Sérieux, fort sérieux_, sir,"
1661,CARRYING ON,"_Silence, silence_, Tiadatha”—"
1662,CARRYING ON,Didn’t see the barbed wire coming
1663,CARRYING ON,"Didn’t see it in the darkness,"
1664,CARRYING ON,"Into his own wire went crashing,"
1665,CARRYING ON,"Dragging Tiadatha with him,"
1666,CARRYING ON,And straightway forgot his warnings.
1667,CARRYING ON,"Terrible the oaths he uttered,"
1668,CARRYING ON,"Cursing loudly in the French tongue,"
1669,CARRYING ON,"Crept out of the jangling barbed wire,"
1670,CARRYING ON,Extricated Tiadatha.
1671,CARRYING ON,"Thereupon a Bulgar sentry,"
1672,CARRYING ON,"Wakened from his pleasant slumbers,"
1673,CARRYING ON,"Feeling rather bored about it,"
1674,CARRYING ON,"Heaved a bomb at Captain Siomme,"
1675,CARRYING ON,"Heaved a bomb at Tiadatha,"
1676,CARRYING ON,"As a householder in London,"
1677,CARRYING ON,Wakened from his pleasant slumber
1678,CARRYING ON,"By a tomcat on the house tiles,"
1679,CARRYING ON,"Opens wide his bedroom window,"
1680,CARRYING ON,Heaves a boot jack at the noises.
1681,CARRYING ON,Then a zealous Dudshire sentry
1682,CARRYING ON,"Swiftly flung a bomb in answer,"
1683,CARRYING ON,"Followed it with five rounds rapid,"
1684,CARRYING ON,Thinking that there was a war on.
1685,CARRYING ON,"Then the Bulgars sent a light up,"
1686,CARRYING ON,"And another and another,"
1687,CARRYING ON,Made the darkness light as Bond Street
1688,CARRYING ON,On an afternoon in winter.
1689,CARRYING ON,Siomme and my Tiadatha
1690,CARRYING ON,"Lay and grovelled on their tummies,"
1691,CARRYING ON,Still as any startled tortoise.
1692,CARRYING ON,After that the German gunners
1693,CARRYING ON,"Put a dozen salvoes over,"
1694,CARRYING ON,"And the English field-guns opened,"
1695,CARRYING ON,Feeling sure there was a war on.
1696,CARRYING ON,Bits of bombs and crumps and shrapnel
1697,CARRYING ON,"Made the autumn evening hideous,"
1698,CARRYING ON,"Groups stood to, machine-guns rattled,"
1699,CARRYING ON,"All the telephones got busy,"
1700,CARRYING ON,And supports turned out in dudgeon.
1701,CARRYING ON,
1702,CARRYING ON,As a prairie fire is started
1703,CARRYING ON,"By a match or cigarette end,"
1704,CARRYING ON,So a mighty strafe was started
1705,CARRYING ON,All because the gallant Siomme
1706,CARRYING ON,Fell into his own defences.
1707,CARRYING ON,
1708,CARRYING ON,"Swiftly as it came, it faded,"
1709,CARRYING ON,"And the night regained its stillness,"
1710,CARRYING ON,"Gunners settled down to slumber,"
1711,CARRYING ON,"Sentries settled down to watching,"
1712,CARRYING ON,"Telephones at last subsided,"
1713,CARRYING ON,And fed-up supports departed
1714,CARRYING ON,To their dug-outs in the trenches.
1715,CARRYING ON,
1716,CARRYING ON,Siomme and my Tiadatha
1717,CARRYING ON,Found their way back in the darkness
1718,CARRYING ON,"To the Company Headquarters,"
1719,CARRYING ON,Pledged once more eternal friendship
1720,CARRYING ON,"In another mug of _vin rouge_,"
1721,CARRYING ON,"Afterwards in one of whisky,"
1722,CARRYING ON,Then wired in “relief completed.”
1723,CARRYING ON,After which the gallant Captain
1724,CARRYING ON,And his officers and privates
1725,CARRYING ON,Straggled off into the darkness
1726,CARRYING ON,To wherever they were going.

1744,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Strung like jade in the Pacific,"

1762,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Lovely when you first behold it,"
1763,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,It becomes a trifle boring

1765,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Every morning as the dawn breaks,"

1772,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Through the livelong Serbian winter,"

1778,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,All those winter months the Dudshires
1779,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Picked and dug the Serbian hillside.
1780,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Left their mark on Macedonia
1781,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Like a tripper on a tree trunk,"
1782,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Slaved their souls out making trenches,"
1783,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Slaved their souls out making dug-outs,"
1784,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,That they might be somewhat safer
1785,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"From the beastly little pipsqueaks,"
1786,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"From the most unpleasant whizzbangs,"
1787,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"From the great big five-point-niners,"

1789,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,
1790,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Then one day quoth Tiadatha,"
1791,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"“I am sick of leafy bowers,"
1792,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,I am sick of bivvy shelters;
1793,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"They are too darned cold for one thing,"
1794,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Much too narrow for another.
1795,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"I will also make a dug-out,"
1796,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Make myself a home to live in,"
1797,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Furnish it unto my liking,"
1798,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Coax perhaps a little comfort
1799,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Even out of Macedonia.”
1800,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,
1801,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"So he called for Woggs, his batman,"
1802,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Bade him fetch a pick and shovel,"
1803,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Doffed his tunic, tie and collar,"
1804,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Set to work with Woggs in earnest.
1805,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"All day long they picked and shovelled,"
1806,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Pausing only when a crump came,"
1807,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Pausing only for a pipsqueak,"
1808,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Till poor Tiadatha’s back ached,"
1809,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Till his hands were badly blistered,"
1810,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,And he wearied of the labour.
1811,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Called in four stout private soldiers,"
1812,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Set them too upon the digging,"
1813,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Helped to fill and tie the sandbags,"
1814,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Helped to get them in position,"
1815,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Leaving spaces for a window
1816,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,And a little narrow doorway.
1817,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,
1818,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Then he called again his batman,"
1819,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Called for Woggs the faithful batman,"
1820,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Whispered certain secret orders,"
1821,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"And, upon the morning after,"
1822,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Found himself the proud possessor
1823,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Of a dozen sheets of iron,"
1824,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Sheets of corrugated iron,"
1825,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,And some bits of brand-new timber.
1826,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Little recked my Tiadatha
1827,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,That a certain R.E. Captain
1828,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Even then was musing darkly
1829,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,As to where the stuff had got to.
1830,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,
1831,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,So they roofed the little dug-out
1832,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"With the scraps of purloined timber,"
1833,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"With the bits of stolen iron,"
1834,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Then they piled the roof with sandbags,"
1835,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Fondly hoping it would keep out
1836,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Anyhow a dud or pipsqueak.
1837,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,
1838,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Then the tireless Woggs got busy,"
1839,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Hung the walls with bits of sacking,"
1840,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Made a chair and made a table
1841,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"And some shelves from ration boxes,"
1842,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Even made a little washstand,"
1843,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"With an old tin hat for basin,"
1844,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"And a rather dicky bedstead,"
1845,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,From a few odd wiring pickets
1846,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,And a roll of rabbit netting
1847,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,(Borrowed from the Sergeant-Major
1848,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"When that worthy wasn’t looking),"
1849,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Filled an old tin mug with flowers,"
1850,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Decked the walls with dreadful pictures
1851,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,From _La Vie_ and from _The Tatler_.
1852,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,
1853,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"“One thing more,” cried Tiadatha,"
1854,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,“One thing even now is lacking.
1855,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"What about a little fireplace,"
1856,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"What about it, O my batman?”"
1857,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Not a word spoke Woggs the batman,"
1858,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Save to murmur, “Very good, sir,”"
1859,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Went and pinched an empty oil drum,"
1860,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Spent the afternoon in hammering;
1861,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Hammered till he woke the Colonel,"
1862,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Hammered till he woke the Major.
1863,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Moved away a little farther,"
1864,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Till he’d got his job of work done,"
1865,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Then he fixed it in the dug-out,"
1866,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"With some puddled mud he fixed it,"
1867,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Got a piece of tin for chimney,"
1868,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Dug some vine roots up for firewood,"
1869,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Eked them out with bits of charcoal
1870,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Wangled from Headquarters’ cookhouse.
1871,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,
1872,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"And that night my Tiadatha,"
1873,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Wet and weary from the trenches,"
1874,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Found a cheery wood fire blazing,"
1875,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Found a most uncommon fug up.
1876,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"“It is well,” said Tiadatha,"
1877,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"“It is well, my soldier servant,"
1878,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Well and truly have you served me.
1879,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Take this tin of Craven Mixture,"
1880,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Take this tin of Royal Beauties,"
1881,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Take this tin of Cadbury’s chocolate.
1882,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Also there is my rum ration,"
1883,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"You are very welcome to it,"
1884,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"And I’ll see the Sergeant-Major,"
1885,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Get you off parade to-morrow.”
1886,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,
1887,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Then he drew his crazy chair up,"
1888,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Lit his pipe and stretched his legs out,"
1889,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Heaved a sigh of great contentment,"
1890,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Gazed into the flames in silence,"
1891,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Dreaming of his green-eyed Phyllis,"
1892,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"And of Murray’s where he met her,"
1893,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Dreaming of his loved St. James’s,"
1894,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,So forgot the war a little.
1895,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,
1896,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Tiadatha’d learnt the lesson
1897,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Which is learnt by every traveller,"
1898,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,That wherever you may wander
1899,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,You should never be uncomfy
1900,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Any longer than you’ve got to,"
1901,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Never play the Spartan hero
1902,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,When there isn’t any need to.
1903,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"If you set your mind upon it,"
1904,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,You can always coax some comfort
1905,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,"Out of life and barren hillsides,"
1906,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,Coax it as you’d coax a fiver
1907,TIADATHA’S DUG-OUT,From a very mean old uncle.

1918,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
1919,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
1920,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Many stunts did Tiadatha
1921,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,In the line in front of Doiran.
1922,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,He would often go patrolling
1923,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Right up to the Bulgar trenches;
1924,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Sometimes he would bring a board back
1925,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,With a Bulgar notice on it
1926,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Asking him and all the Dudshires
1927,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,To surrender and be matey.
1928,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Down the steep Patte d’Oie he stumbled,"
1929,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Up and down the winding Jumeaux,"
1930,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Drawing bombs from Bulgar sentries,"
1931,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Drawing everlasting star-shells;
1932,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"He would take a Lewis gun out,"
1933,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Strafe a post or working party,"
1934,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Raid a trench of Johnny Bulgar’s,"
1935,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Blow up several concrete dug-outs,"
1936,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Bring some prisoners home to breakfast.
1937,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Every day the German gunners
1938,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Shelled his line with crumps and shrapnel,"
1939,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,And for months the Royal Dudshires
1940,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Never moved behind their field-guns.
1941,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
1942,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Winter passed with mud and blizzards,"
1943,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Spring-time brought the sun and flowers,"
1944,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Also rumours of advancing,"
1945,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Rumours of attacks in earnest.
1946,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Tiadatha heard the story
1947,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"From his batman, who had got it"
1948,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Off the driver of a lorry,"
1949,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Who had gleaned it from a waiter
1950,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,In a Salonica café.
1951,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
1952,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"There were mighty preparations,"
1953,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Practising attacks and what not;
1954,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Guns sprang up in every corner,"
1955,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Sprang up in the night like mushrooms.
1956,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Dumps like lucky dips were dotted
1957,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"In most unexpected places,"
1958,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Carefully covered with tarpaulins,"
1959,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Camouflaged with leaves and branches;
1960,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Airmen all day long were busy
1961,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Taking photographs of trenches,"
1962,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"And the Staff wrote reams of orders,"
1963,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Reams and reams and reams of orders,"
1964,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,And some more when those were finished.
1965,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
1966,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,On the days before the battle
1967,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"All the British guns were firing,"
1968,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Cutting wire and pounding trenches
1969,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,And O.P.s and gun emplacements;
1970,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Earth and stones went splashing skywards,"
1971,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Just as water in a river
1972,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Splashes when you throw a rock in.
1973,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
1974,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Four days long the guns had thundered,"
1975,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,When one starlit April evening
1976,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Came the Dudshires’ mighty battle.
1977,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Not a man in all the Dudshires,"
1978,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"None who lived to see the daylight,"
1979,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Ever could forget that evening,"
1980,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Least of all my Tiadatha.
1981,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
1982,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Very clear it was and starlight,"
1983,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,And a nightingale was singing
1984,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Somewhere in among the bushes;
1985,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Many of the soldiers heard it
1986,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"In the little lulls of firing,"
1987,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Heard its silver notes go throbbing
1988,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Out into the April evening.
1989,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
1990,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Watch on wrist stood Tiadatha,"
1991,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Gazing anxious at the minutes
1992,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,As the starting time came nearer.
1993,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"He was clad in Tommy’s tunic,"
1994,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Tommy’s breeches and equipment,"
1995,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"In his hands he bore a rifle,"
1996,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,On his head a shrapnel helmet.
1997,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Then at last he gave the signal,"
1998,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,And his men filed out behind him.
1999,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Through the gaps they wound like serpents,"
2000,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Into No Man’s Land they sallied,"
2001,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Through the din of bursting shrapnel,"
2002,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Through the bursting high explosives.
2003,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Down the steep Patte d’Oie he led them,"
2004,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Down that steep and rocky gully,"
2005,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Rocky as a Cornish headland,"
2006,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Steeper than a traveller’s story:
2007,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,There the dread trench mortar barrage
2008,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Swept upon them like a hailstorm,"
2009,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Storm with stones as big as footballs,"
2010,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Stones alive with death and torture.
2011,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Through that blinding storm he led them,"
2012,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Up the farther side he led them—
2013,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,All that were not killed or wounded.
2014,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,There upon the flashing hillside
2015,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Tiadatha crouched and waited,"
2016,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Waited for the Zero hour,"
2017,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"When the barrage would be lengthened,"
2018,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Lifted from the front line trenches.
2019,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
2020,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"As the moment came he leapt up,"
2021,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Gave a shout to all the Dudshires,"
2022,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"And the Dudshires rose and followed,"
2023,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Charged beside my Tiadatha—
2024,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,All who were not killed or wounded.
2025,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Through the broken wire they scrambled,"
2026,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Some men cursing, some men shouting,"
2027,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Some men muttering little prayers,"
2028,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Some in grim and deadly silence.
2029,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
2030,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"They were met by bombs and bullets,"
2031,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Heard the Bulgars in their trenches,"
2032,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Heard them crying: “Come on, Johnny,"
2033,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Come on, come on, English Johnny.”"
2034,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,And three times the Royal Dudshires
2035,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Swept upon the Bulgar trenches,"
2036,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Every time the line was thinner,"
2037,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Every time its heart was steadfast.
2038,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"And the third time Tiadatha,"
2039,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"With a little band behind him,"
2040,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Leapt into the battered trenches,"
2041,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Got to work with bomb and bayonet,"
2042,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,In his heart the lust of battle;
2043,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Then felt something hit his shoulder,"
2044,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Felt his shoulder wet and burning,"
2045,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Found he’d stopped a shrapnel bullet,"
2046,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Set his teeth and staggered onwards,"
2047,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Led his party round a traverse,"
2048,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Bombed a dug-out full of Bulgars,"
2049,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Bombed until his bombs were finished,"
2050,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Carried on with German stink-bombs
2051,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,That the Bulgar’d left behind him.
2052,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
2053,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,On and on the little party
2054,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Pushed along the Bulgar trenches,"
2055,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Till there came a deadly sickness
2056,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Stealing over Tiadatha,"
2057,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"And he knew his strength was failing,"
2058,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Knew that he could get no farther,"
2059,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"So he shouted to his corporal,"
2060,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,“Take them on and do your damnedest.”
2061,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Flopped down in the trench and fainted.
2062,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
2063,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Then came Woggs, the soldier servant,"
2064,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Trusty Woggs, the ever-ready,"
2065,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"And produced a flask of brandy,"
2066,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Poured it down my Tiadatha.
2067,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"“Curse you, Woggs,” said Tiadatha,"
2068,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,“Go on with your section leader.
2069,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Every man of you’ll be wanted,"
2070,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"I’ll crawl back and get my wound dressed,"
2071,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Then I’ll come again and find you.”
2072,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,
2073,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Painfully and very slowly,"
2074,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Somehow Tiadatha stumbled
2075,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Back towards the dressing station,"
2076,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Back through crumps and bursting shrapnel,"
2077,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Met two crawling wounded privates,"
2078,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"And they helped and helped each other,"
2079,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Till at last my Tiadatha
2080,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Found himself upon a stretcher
2081,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,In the crowded dressing station.
2082,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"There they tended him and dressed him,"
2083,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"’Midst the groaning of the wounded,"
2084,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"’Midst the raving of the battle,"
2085,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"And the padre, bending over,"
2086,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Murmured, “Well done, Tiadatha,"
2087,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Anything that I can get you?”
2088,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"And my Tiadatha answered,"
2089,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Smiling through his pain he answered,"
2090,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"“All I want’s some beer, old Padre,"
2091,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Just one bottle very quickly.”
2092,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,

2095,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Had you been there when the dawn broke,"
2096,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Had you looked from out the trenches,"
2097,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"You’d have seen that Serbian hillside,"
2098,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Seen the aftermath of battle.
2099,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Seen the scattered picks and shovels,"
2100,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Seen the scraps of stray equipment.
2101,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Here and there a lonely rifle,"
2102,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Or a Lewis gun all twisted.
2103,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Seen the little heaps of khaki
2104,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Lying huddled on the hillside,"
2105,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Huddled by the Bulgar trenches
2106,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Very still and very silent,"
2107,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Nothing stirring, nothing moving,"
2108,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Save a very gallant doctor
2109,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,And his band of stretcher bearers
2110,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Working fearless in the open,"
2111,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"Giving water to the dying,"
2112,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Bringing in those broken soldiers.
2113,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"You’d have seen the sunlight streaming,"
2114,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,And perhaps you would have wondered
2115,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"How the sun could still be shining,"
2116,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,"How the birds could still be singing,"
2117,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,While so many British soldiers
2118,TIADATHA’S BATTLE,Lay so still upon the hillside.

2133,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Started on his journey Baseward,"

2136,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Fared upon a swaying _dhuli_
2137,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,In an ambulance that shook him
2138,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"As you shake a medicine bottle,"
2139,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Seemed to shake his very soul out.
2140,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Rocking like a tiny dinghy
2141,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,When a choppy sea is running.
2142,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"One night in the Clearing Station,"
2143,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Then by train to Salonica;

2145,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"In F.A. or Clearing Station,"

2148,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"“Unit, age and length of service?”"
2149,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"“Rank and Christian name?” and what not,"

2161,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,“Age of all your aunts and uncles?”

2163,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"To my fevered Tiadatha,"
2164,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Till he dropped to sleep and left them,"
2165,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Those tormentors and their questions,"
2166,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Left them as a railway carriage,"
2167,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Gliding gently from the station,"
2168,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Leaves the crowd upon the platform.
2169,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,
2170,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"But at last the journey ended,"
2171,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Tiadatha came to anchor
2172,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"In a bed with snowy pillows,"
2173,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Bed with snowy sheets and pillows
2174,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Cool and sweet as flowing water,"
2175,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Soothing as a summer’s evening,"
2176,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Comforting as cherry brandy
2177,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,On a chilly winter morning.
2178,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"He was tended by a sister,"
2179,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Soft of voice and very gentle,"
2180,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"And she seemed to Tiadatha,"
2181,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"After all those months of warfare,"
2182,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Like a little glimpse of England,"
2183,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Made him think of English roses,"
2184,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,English lanes and English gardens;
2185,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"And he looked at her and loved her,"
2186,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Wondered vaguely what her name was,"
2187,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"If she ever lost her temper,"
2188,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"How she kept her hands so lovely,"
2189,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,How on earth she put her cap on.
2190,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,
2191,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Soon there came a solemn conclave
2192,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Round the bed of Tiadatha,"
2193,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Which discussed if it should send him
2194,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,To the X-Rays or the Theatre
2195,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,(Ghastly irony “the Theatre”).
2196,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Starved him for a day and sent him
2197,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,To the operating table.
2198,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,There the luckless Tiadatha
2199,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Felt the world go slipping from him
2200,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Used the most appalling language,"
2201,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Knew no more till all was over,"
2202,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Came to, feeling sick and sorry,"
2203,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Found himself a mass of bandage,"
2204,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Found himself a lump of aching,"
2205,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,And beheld the shrapnel bullet
2206,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,He had stopped that April evening.
2207,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Back they took him to his pillows,"
2208,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"And his gentle, soft-voiced sister"
2209,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Laid her cool hand on his forehead,"
2210,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,And a peace came stealing o’er him
2211,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,As a mist steals o’er the mountains.
2212,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,
2213,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Very soon my Tiadatha
2214,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Got to know the faces near him,"
2215,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Got to know his brother patients;
2216,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,They exchanged some lurid details
2217,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Of their wounds and operations,"
2218,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Finding that a touch of shrapnel
2219,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Always makes the whole world kindred.
2220,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"And he soon got fit to grumble,"
2221,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Grouse and grumble at his diet,"
2222,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Groused that it was mostly liquid,"
2223,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Yet without a drop of whisky;
2224,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,As an exile in the tropics
2225,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Pines to smell an English primrose,"
2226,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,So poor thirsty Tiadatha
2227,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Pined to smell a Scotch-and-Soda.
2228,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,
2229,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Gradually came convalescence,"
2230,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Days made up of little trials,"
2231,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Days made up of little pleasures,"
2232,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Days of unaccustomed idling,"
2233,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Pleasant days of doing nothing;
2234,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Every morning after breakfast
2235,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"He would lie back on his pillows,"
2236,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Read his _Balkan News_ in comfort,"
2237,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Spend his day in eating, sleeping,"
2238,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Killing flies and reading novels,"
2239,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Writing to his green-eyed Phyllis,"
2240,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Taking very nasty medicine,"
2241,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Listening to another’s snoring;
2242,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,And sometimes a Dudshire brother
2243,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Came and saw him for a minute,"
2244,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Brought some scandal from the trenches,"
2245,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Did my Tiadatha’s heart good.
2246,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,
2247,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Then at last there came a morning
2248,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"When his smiling sister told him,"
2249,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"“Yes, you _may_ get up this morning,"
2250,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Walk about a bit this morning.”
2251,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"In his good time, Tiadatha"
2252,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Washed and shaved and got some clothes on,"
2253,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Tried to walk about a little,"
2254,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Felt as though the bones were missing
2255,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"From his knees and from his ankles,"
2256,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Tottered as a baby totters
2257,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Staggering from chair to table,"
2258,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Called his sympathetic sister,"
2259,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Found her arm was very helpful.
2260,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,
2261,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Slowly like a tide his strength came,"
2262,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Like a rising tide his strength came,"
2263,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Like a rising wind his spirits.
2264,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"And he sat out in the sunshine,"
2265,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Pottered round the wards and compounds
2266,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Chatting to a wounded Tommy,"
2267,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Chatting to a Dudshire brother,"
2268,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Wrote more letters, read more novels,"
2269,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Played the gramophone for ages,"
2270,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Played a game of bridge and poker,"
2271,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Went for picnics with his sister,"
2272,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Sometimes by the sandy seashore,"
2273,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Sometimes on a shady hillside,"
2274,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Recking little of the matron.
2275,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,
2276,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Then one afternoon the General
2277,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Came into the ward to see him,"
2278,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Pinned a ribbon on his tunic,"
2279,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Pinned the M.C. ribbon on him,"
2280,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Saying, “Well done, Tiadatha,"
2281,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,May you have long life to wear it!”
2282,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Whereupon my Tiadatha
2283,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Very nearly asked the General
2284,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"What on earth he’d done to get it,"
2285,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Done to earn that precious ribbon,"
2286,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Having hazy recollections
2287,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Of that most unpleasant evening.
2288,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"But was very bucked about it,"
2289,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Sent a cable to his mother,"
2290,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Sent one to his green-eyed Phyllis,"
2291,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Held a little celebration
2292,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"At the French Club on the quiet,"
2293,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Did himself so very proudly
2294,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,That his temperature went soaring
2295,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,In the morning like a skylark.
2296,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,
2297,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,*       *       *       *       *
2298,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,
2299,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Hospital, like work and whisky,"
2300,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Is a taste to be acquired,"
2301,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"But it soon becomes a habit,"
2302,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Very soon becomes a habit.
2303,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,That was why my Tiadatha
2304,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Felt so very loth to leave it,"
2305,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Loth to leave his bed and pillows,"
2306,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Loth to leave those kindly people,"
2307,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Cheery V.A.D.s and sisters,"
2308,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Who had fed and dressed and nursed him
2309,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Just as if he’d been a baby;
2310,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"And his heart was very heavy,"
2311,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Fuller than a well-filled wine-glass,"
2312,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"As he thought of those brave people,"
2313,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Brave as any soldier hero,"
2314,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Working through the Balkan summer,"
2315,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Working through the Balkan winter,"
2316,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Working harder far than he did,"
2317,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,All for him and such as he was.
2318,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,But at last the time of parting
2319,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Came, relentless as to-morrow,"
2320,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,And a sad-faced Tiadatha
2321,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,Set off on a bumpy journey
2322,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"To the wooded slopes of Hortiach,"
2323,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"Said good-bye to those good comrades,"
2324,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,"To those V.A.D.s and sisters,"
2325,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,To those little scraps of England.
2326,TIADATHA IN HOSPITAL,

2331,CHAPTER XIV,
2332,THE FIRE,THE FIRE
2333,THE FIRE,
2334,THE FIRE,
2335,THE FIRE,For a while my Tiadatha
2336,THE FIRE,"Rested on the slopes of Hortiach,"
2337,THE FIRE,Rested till he’d got his strength back.
2338,THE FIRE,"Then at Summer Hill he sojourned,"
2339,THE FIRE,Barren camp where no one lingers
2340,THE FIRE,Any longer than he’s got to;
2341,THE FIRE,Thence he went by easy stages
2342,THE FIRE,Back to join the Royal Dudshires.
2343,THE FIRE,"Found them up at Karasouli,"
2344,THE FIRE,Found so many faces missing
2345,THE FIRE,"That at first his heart was lonely,"
2346,THE FIRE,"But a few were still remaining,"
2347,THE FIRE,"Still a few familiar faces,"
2348,THE FIRE,"And they made him very welcome,"
2349,THE FIRE,With them Woggs his soldier servant.
2350,THE FIRE,"But although he made new comrades,"
2351,THE FIRE,"Carried on without the old ones,"
2352,THE FIRE,"Yet his heart was often lonely,"
2353,THE FIRE,Lonely for those missing faces.
2354,THE FIRE,
2355,THE FIRE,"Thus they met another summer,"
2356,THE FIRE,"Sweltered through another summer,"
2357,THE FIRE,Changing over every fortnight
2358,THE FIRE,With a neighbouring battalion.
2359,THE FIRE,"Smol and Macukovo saw them,"
2360,THE FIRE,"Waggon Hill and Green Hill saw them,"
2361,THE FIRE,"Dache, “P.N.,” and Kalinova,"
2362,THE FIRE,"And the muddy Vardar River,"
2363,THE FIRE,And they did a so-called rest cure
2364,THE FIRE,On the side of shadeless Kirec.
2365,THE FIRE,
2366,THE FIRE,Then one day in blazing August
2367,THE FIRE,"Tiadatha pinched a week-end,"
2368,THE FIRE,"Touched his Colonel for a week-end,"
2369,THE FIRE,"“Just to do a bit of shopping,”"
2370,THE FIRE,And buzzed down to Salonica
2371,THE FIRE,"With his very best pal, Percy,"
2372,THE FIRE,"Put up at the Hotel Splendide,"
2373,THE FIRE,"Taking Woggs, the soldier servant."
2374,THE FIRE,
2375,THE FIRE,"After tea at Uncle Floca’s,"
2376,THE FIRE,"After tea they did some shopping,"
2377,THE FIRE,"Bought some Mess stores from Coppola’s,"
2378,THE FIRE,Bought some braces from Orosdi’s
2379,THE FIRE,"(Selfridge’s of Salonica),"
2380,THE FIRE,Took some watches for repairing
2381,THE FIRE,"As requested by their sergeants,"
2382,THE FIRE,"Had a shampoo and a haircut,"
2383,THE FIRE,"Had their usual bath at Botton’s,"
2384,THE FIRE,Sauntered back towards the Splendide
2385,THE FIRE,For their evening gin and vermouth.
2386,THE FIRE,
2387,THE FIRE,"They were met by Woggs the batman,"
2388,THE FIRE,"Trusty Woggs the ever-ready,"
2389,THE FIRE,In a state of huge excitement:
2390,THE FIRE,"“Please, sir, half the town’s ablaze, sir;"
2391,THE FIRE,"Started in the Turkish Quarter,"
2392,THE FIRE,May be here at any moment.”
2393,THE FIRE,
2394,THE FIRE,"“Oh, indeed,” said Tiadatha,"
2395,THE FIRE,"Thinking very little of it,"
2396,THE FIRE,"“Come as usual in the morning,”"
2397,THE FIRE,Went with Percy to the French Club
2398,THE FIRE,Bent upon a pleasant evening.
2399,THE FIRE,
2400,THE FIRE,"All things can be won by waiting,"
2401,THE FIRE,"All things can be won by pushing,"
2402,THE FIRE,"Even dinner at the French Club,"
2403,THE FIRE,Where our very generous Allies
2404,THE FIRE,Let us come and eat their rations.
2405,THE FIRE,"There they had a special dinner,"
2406,THE FIRE,"Percy and my Tiadatha,"
2407,THE FIRE,"Cooked as only Frenchmen can cook,"
2408,THE FIRE,"With some passable Veuve Clicquot,"
2409,THE FIRE,"Drier than Macaulay’s Essays,"
2410,THE FIRE,"Cheering as a nigger rag-time,"
2411,THE FIRE,"Followed by some fine old brandy,"
2412,THE FIRE,"All produced by smiling Camille,"
2413,THE FIRE,"Now a _poilu_, late of Prince’s."
2414,THE FIRE,
2415,THE FIRE,Then they wandered to the Tour Blanche
2416,THE FIRE,"For the usual evening revel,"
2417,THE FIRE,"Feeling very bright and merry,"
2418,THE FIRE,Found the doors were barred against them.
2419,THE FIRE,Wandered on a little farther
2420,THE FIRE,"To the Leicester Lounge and Gaiety,"
2421,THE FIRE,"Found the doors were barred against them,"
2422,THE FIRE,Found them housing homeless women
2423,THE FIRE,With their baggage and their babies.
2424,THE FIRE,"“Woggs was right,” said Tiadatha,"
2425,THE FIRE,“True enough the town is blazing;
2426,THE FIRE,This is going to be ‘some’ evening.”
2427,THE FIRE,
2428,THE FIRE,"All the sky was glowing crimson,"
2429,THE FIRE,"Clouds of smoke were welling upwards,"
2430,THE FIRE,And the sparks like golden raindrops
2431,THE FIRE,Poured upon those wooden houses
2432,THE FIRE,Packed like herrings in a barrel;
2433,THE FIRE,"And a mighty wind was blowing,"
2434,THE FIRE,Sweeping from the hills to seaward.
2435,THE FIRE,Percy and my Tiadatha
2436,THE FIRE,"Dashed along the Rue Egnatia,"
2437,THE FIRE,Saw the fire was driving down it
2438,THE FIRE,As a bore drives down a river;
2439,THE FIRE,"Ruthless as an angry bison,"
2440,THE FIRE,"Hungry as a famished tiger,"
2441,THE FIRE,"Eating up the wooden houses,"
2442,THE FIRE,Eating up the shops and cafés.
2443,THE FIRE,"Falling beams and crashing shutters,"
2444,THE FIRE,"All were gone in half a minute,"
2445,THE FIRE,Swallowed by that whirling furnace.
2446,THE FIRE,Soon it burnt the Provost Marshal
2447,THE FIRE,"Out of his expensive office,"
2448,THE FIRE,"Soon it reached the Rue Venizelos,"
2449,THE FIRE,Where a fitful fire-engine
2450,THE FIRE,(All that Salonica boasted)
2451,THE FIRE,"Played upon the flames in trickles,"
2452,THE FIRE,Did about as much to quench them
2453,THE FIRE,As a mug of tepid water
2454,THE FIRE,Does to quench the thirst of soldiers
2455,THE FIRE,In a boiling Balkan summer.
2456,THE FIRE,"“Going some,” said Tiadatha,"
2457,THE FIRE,"“Better hop back to the Splendide,"
2458,THE FIRE,Heaven and earth aren’t going to stop it.”
2459,THE FIRE,
2460,THE FIRE,"So they raced back to the Splendide,"
2461,THE FIRE,Found that Woggs had packed their kits up
2462,THE FIRE,"Ready for a hasty exit,"
2463,THE FIRE,"For already flames were lapping,"
2464,THE FIRE,"Like the waves, against the Splendide."
2465,THE FIRE,All along the Odos Nike
2466,THE FIRE,"Clouds of smoke came welling faster,"
2467,THE FIRE,"Thicker than a fog in London,"
2468,THE FIRE,"And a million sparks were whirling,"
2469,THE FIRE,And the flames were sweeping nearer.
2470,THE FIRE,"Coughing, choking, nearly blinded,"
2471,THE FIRE,"Tiadatha, Woggs and Percy"
2472,THE FIRE,"Stumbled through the smoky blackness,"
2473,THE FIRE,"Tripping over bits of wreckage,"
2474,THE FIRE,"Fought their way along the sea front,"
2475,THE FIRE,While the sparks came showering on them
2476,THE FIRE,"Like confetti at a wedding,"
2477,THE FIRE,And they got the wind up badly—
2478,THE FIRE,Worse than on that April evening
2479,THE FIRE,When they went for Johnny Bulgar—
2480,THE FIRE,"Passed the old White Tower panting,"
2481,THE FIRE,Reached the French Club Courtyard breathless.
2482,THE FIRE,
2483,THE FIRE,In the Courtyard of the French Club
2484,THE FIRE,"On its side an urn reposes,"
2485,THE FIRE,"Old and huge and most capacious,"
2486,THE FIRE,Dug up by our gallant Allies
2487,THE FIRE,"From the heart of Macedonia,"
2488,THE FIRE,And it seemed to Tiadatha
2489,THE FIRE,"Just the haven that they wanted,"
2490,THE FIRE,"So he bade Woggs dump their kits in,"
2491,THE FIRE,"Bade him scramble in and guard them,"
2492,THE FIRE,Then went back to do the hero
2493,THE FIRE,With a very breathless Percy.
2494,THE FIRE,
2495,THE FIRE,"All the streets were wild confusion,"
2496,THE FIRE,"Refugees were streaming Eastward,"
2497,THE FIRE,"Pouring Eastward in their thousands,"
2498,THE FIRE,"Some with loaded carts and donkeys,"
2499,THE FIRE,Some with gharries piled to heaven.
2500,THE FIRE,"Old men bleating, children screaming,"
2501,THE FIRE,"Broken-hearted women sobbing,"
2502,THE FIRE,Wailing for their homes and treasures.
2503,THE FIRE,All the streets were blocked and littered
2504,THE FIRE,"With all kinds of goods and chattels,"
2505,THE FIRE,"Feather mattresses and tables,"
2506,THE FIRE,"Chairs and clocks and iron bedsteads,"
2507,THE FIRE,"Looking glasses, jugs and bundles,"
2508,THE FIRE,"Pillows, pots and pans and pictures."
2509,THE FIRE,
2510,THE FIRE,Percy and my Tiadatha
2511,THE FIRE,"Took their stand at a street corner,"
2512,THE FIRE,"Started running things in earnest,"
2513,THE FIRE,"Cleared the houses of the people,"
2514,THE FIRE,"Helped them get what things they could out,"
2515,THE FIRE,Made them leave the things they couldn’t.
2516,THE FIRE,"Chased and biffed the wandering looters,"
2517,THE FIRE,"Kept the crowd back and the road clear,"
2518,THE FIRE,Got the women and the children
2519,THE FIRE,"On the waiting motor lorries,"
2520,THE FIRE,Packed them off to refugee camps;
2521,THE FIRE,And their hardest job of all was
2522,THE FIRE,Parting one old Turkish lady
2523,THE FIRE,From the frowsty feather mattress
2524,THE FIRE,That they couldn’t load up with her
2525,THE FIRE,On the overflowing lorry.
2526,THE FIRE,When the fire had reached their corner
2527,THE FIRE,"They would move on to the next one,"
2528,THE FIRE,Like a pair of organ grinders
2529,THE FIRE,"Made to move on by a footman,"
2530,THE FIRE,"Giving ground, but giving slowly,"
2531,THE FIRE,Fighting out a rearguard action.
2532,THE FIRE,And at every other corner
2533,THE FIRE,Of the doomed and burning city
2534,THE FIRE,"Slaved the likes of Tiadatha,"
2535,THE FIRE,"Officers and private soldiers,"
2536,THE FIRE,Fighting fire instead of Bulgars.
2537,THE FIRE,"Many parts they played that evening,"
2538,THE FIRE,"Fireman, policeman, knight and coolie,"
2539,THE FIRE,"Till their eyes were red and burning,"
2540,THE FIRE,"Choc-a-bloc with grit and cinders,"
2541,THE FIRE,"Till their clothes were scorched and blackened,"
2542,THE FIRE,Till their heads and feet and backs ached.
2543,THE FIRE,And that night my Tiadatha
2544,THE FIRE,Saw some sights not good to look on.
2545,THE FIRE,"Many thousand hearts were broken,"
2546,THE FIRE,Many thousand people homeless.
2547,THE FIRE,
2548,THE FIRE,"As the night wore on a damsel,"
2549,THE FIRE,"Tearful and quite unattractive,"
2550,THE FIRE,"Came beseeching Tiadatha,"
2551,THE FIRE,"Begged and prayed him come and help her,"
2552,THE FIRE,Help her save some cherished treasures.
2553,THE FIRE,Up some burning stairs she led them
2554,THE FIRE,"(Having roped in Percy also),"
2555,THE FIRE,"Pointed to a clock and mirror,"
2556,THE FIRE,Hideous both and very heavy.
2557,THE FIRE,Quick as lightning Tiadatha
2558,THE FIRE,Pounced upon the gilt-framed mirror
2559,THE FIRE,"(Since it looked a little lighter),"
2560,THE FIRE,Left the massive clock for Percy;
2561,THE FIRE,"Down the stairs they crashed together,"
2562,THE FIRE,In their arms these precious treasures
2563,THE FIRE,Of this unattractive damsel.
2564,THE FIRE,"Out into the street they lugged them,"
2565,THE FIRE,"Put them down upon the pavement,"
2566,THE FIRE,But she begged and prayed them follow
2567,THE FIRE,Whither she had left her mother
2568,THE FIRE,And the rest of her belongings.
2569,THE FIRE,"So they left their job and followed,"
2570,THE FIRE,"Followed like Quixotic idiots,"
2571,THE FIRE,"Staggered with the clock and mirror,"
2572,THE FIRE,Which became extremely heavy;
2573,THE FIRE,"Through the burning streets they tottered,"
2574,THE FIRE,"Past the weeping homeless outcasts,"
2575,THE FIRE,With the things upon their shoulders;
2576,THE FIRE,"Humped them till their backs were breaking,"
2577,THE FIRE,Till at last their souls revolted.
2578,THE FIRE,"“Finish, Mademoiselle,” said Percy,"
2579,THE FIRE,"Firm, though quite polite about it,"
2580,THE FIRE,"“Not another yard,” said Percy,"
2581,THE FIRE,"“Not a step,” said Tiadatha."
2582,THE FIRE,"“_Pas loin d’ici_,” sobbed the maiden,"
2583,THE FIRE,"Wept the unattractive damsel,"
2584,THE FIRE,"“Only just a little farther,"
2585,THE FIRE,Just a very little farther.”
2586,THE FIRE,On they went like two knight-errants
2587,THE FIRE,"Out to serve their lovely lady,"
2588,THE FIRE,Till they reached the bit of garden
2589,THE FIRE,That surrounds the old White Tower.
2590,THE FIRE,"There they found the maiden’s mother,"
2591,THE FIRE,"Found her doddering old father,"
2592,THE FIRE,"Felt most awfully sorry for them,"
2593,THE FIRE,Sorry they could do so little;
2594,THE FIRE,"Sheepishly received their blessing,"
2595,THE FIRE,"Dumped the clock and dumped the mirror,"
2596,THE FIRE,Feeling very much like Sinbad
2597,THE FIRE,When at last he’d dumped the old man
2598,THE FIRE,Who had ridden on his shoulders.
2599,THE FIRE,"“Nearly five,” said Tiadatha,"
2600,THE FIRE,“And the dawn will soon be breaking.
2601,THE FIRE,"Percy, I am sick and weary,"
2602,THE FIRE,"And my eyes are full of cinders,"
2603,THE FIRE,And my tongue as dry as Aden—
2604,THE FIRE,"What about a rest, old sportsman?”"
2605,THE FIRE,As he spoke he cast about him
2606,THE FIRE,"For a haven, for a refuge,"
2607,THE FIRE,"Spied a T.B. in the harbour,"
2608,THE FIRE,Hailed the captain through the darkness.
2609,THE FIRE,"Came the answer through the darkness,"
2610,THE FIRE,"“Come aboard and have some whisky,"
2611,THE FIRE,"Come aboard, I’ll send a boat off.”"
2612,THE FIRE,
2613,THE FIRE,Percy and my Tiadatha
2614,THE FIRE,"Soon were settled in the T.B.,"
2615,THE FIRE,"Drank the Captain’s old Scotch whisky,"
2616,THE FIRE,"Munched his sandwiches and biscuits,"
2617,THE FIRE,"Murmured as they drank together,"
2618,THE FIRE,"“When in trouble, try the Navy,"
2619,THE FIRE,"Bless their souls, the British Navy!”"
2620,THE FIRE,"Then they watched the fire raging,"
2621,THE FIRE,"Watched it burning from the harbour,"
2622,THE FIRE,Tossing like a fiery ocean;
2623,THE FIRE,Watched the shops and cafés blazing
2624,THE FIRE,"All along the stricken sea-front,"
2625,THE FIRE,Watched a flame that leapt to Heaven
2626,THE FIRE,"Writhing like a dancing Dervish,"
2627,THE FIRE,Watched a minaret uprising
2628,THE FIRE,"White against the molten background,"
2629,THE FIRE,And bethought them of the watches
2630,THE FIRE,"They had taken for repairing,"
2631,THE FIRE,Made some rueful calculations
2632,THE FIRE,Of the cost of seven new ones.
2633,THE FIRE,
2634,THE FIRE,"As the dawn came, Tiadatha,"
2635,THE FIRE,Cheered to see the M.T. engine
2636,THE FIRE,"Save the English Quay from ruin,"
2637,THE FIRE,Gazed on ravaged Salonica
2638,THE FIRE,"With its blackened, gutted buildings,"
2639,THE FIRE,"Thought of cheery times he’d spent there,"
2640,THE FIRE,"Thought of many noisy evenings,"
2641,THE FIRE,"Murmured “No more teas at Floca’s,"
2642,THE FIRE,"No more shopping at Orosdi’s,"
2643,THE FIRE,"No more dinners at the Splendide,"
2644,THE FIRE,No more revels at the Odéon.”
2645,THE FIRE,"Murmured “Poor old Salonica,"
2646,THE FIRE,"Dear old dirty Salonica,"
2647,THE FIRE,"Salonica, finish Johnny.”"

2654,SNEVCE WAY,SNEVCE WAY
2655,SNEVCE WAY,
2656,SNEVCE WAY,
2657,SNEVCE WAY,Some days after Salonica
2658,SNEVCE WAY,"Had been burnt and devastated,"
2659,SNEVCE WAY,Tiadatha and the Dudshires
2660,SNEVCE WAY,"Trekked across the hills to Snevce,"
2661,SNEVCE WAY,To the Doya Tepe sector.
2662,SNEVCE WAY,Settled in Popovo village
2663,SNEVCE WAY,"In the ruins of Surlovo,"
2664,SNEVCE WAY,Giving thanks to the Italians
2665,SNEVCE WAY,"For the huts they’d left behind them,"
2666,SNEVCE WAY,"Huts with well-planked walls and ceilings,"
2667,SNEVCE WAY,"Roofed with red tiles from the village,"
2668,SNEVCE WAY,"Fitted out with chairs and tables,"
2669,SNEVCE WAY,Beds and doors and real glass windows.
2670,SNEVCE WAY,"Very restful, very soothing,"
2671,SNEVCE WAY,After the eternal sandbags
2672,SNEVCE WAY,And the corrugated iron
2673,SNEVCE WAY,Of the dug-outs they’d been used to—
2674,SNEVCE WAY,Just like moving to the Carlton
2675,SNEVCE WAY,Out of rather third-rate lodgings.
2676,SNEVCE WAY,
2677,SNEVCE WAY,"Very soon my Tiadatha,"
2678,SNEVCE WAY,"Now become a swanking captain,"
2679,SNEVCE WAY,Found the Doya Tepe sector
2680,SNEVCE WAY,Was indeed the silver lining
2681,SNEVCE WAY,"To the cloud of Macedonia,"
2682,SNEVCE WAY,"And one clear September morning,"
2683,SNEVCE WAY,"On a hill above Popovo,"
2684,SNEVCE WAY,"High above Popovo village,"
2685,SNEVCE WAY,"Gazed upon the scene before him,"
2686,SNEVCE WAY,Thought it very good to look on.
2687,SNEVCE WAY,
2688,SNEVCE WAY,"Down below along the foothills,"
2689,SNEVCE WAY,"Ran the line of Dudshire trenches,"
2690,SNEVCE WAY,"And the wire wound like a ribbon,"
2691,SNEVCE WAY,"Like a long brown crinkled ribbon,"
2692,SNEVCE WAY,"Up and down the wooded hillsides,"
2693,SNEVCE WAY,Up and down the wooded gullies.
2694,SNEVCE WAY,There was blue smoke curling upwards
2695,SNEVCE WAY,"From a company headquarters,"
2696,SNEVCE WAY,And he saw some soldiers bathing
2697,SNEVCE WAY,In a pool beside the village—
2698,SNEVCE WAY,"From below the voices reached him,"
2699,SNEVCE WAY,Clear as bells their voices reached him
2700,SNEVCE WAY,In the honey-coloured sunshine.
2701,SNEVCE WAY,"And beyond the line of trenches,"
2702,SNEVCE WAY,Just beyond the wooded foothills
2703,SNEVCE WAY,"Lay the smiling open valley,"
2704,SNEVCE WAY,"Varied as a landscape target,"
2705,SNEVCE WAY,"Threaded by the Hodza Suju,"
2706,SNEVCE WAY,"By the sandy Hodza river,"
2707,SNEVCE WAY,"Bright as mackerel in the sunshine,"
2708,SNEVCE WAY,Brighter than a string of opals;
2709,SNEVCE WAY,"White against the emerald background,"
2710,SNEVCE WAY,Ruined villages were dotted
2711,SNEVCE WAY,With their vineyards and their orchards:
2712,SNEVCE WAY,"Brest and Nikolic and Palmis,"
2713,SNEVCE WAY,Bulamac and Akindzali.
2714,SNEVCE WAY,There were woods and shady copses
2715,SNEVCE WAY,"And a line of tidy poplars,"
2716,SNEVCE WAY,"Here a mill with tangled creepers,"
2717,SNEVCE WAY,"There a disused Turkish fountain,"
2718,SNEVCE WAY,"And the long straight line of railway,"
2719,SNEVCE WAY,"With a few old trucks upon it,"
2720,SNEVCE WAY,Where in happier days the trains ran
2721,SNEVCE WAY,"Up and down the Struma valley,"
2722,SNEVCE WAY,To and from Constantinople.
2723,SNEVCE WAY,
2724,SNEVCE WAY,And five miles across the valley
2725,SNEVCE WAY,"Rose the Belashitza Mountains,"
2726,SNEVCE WAY,"Rose the Beles grim and lofty,"
2727,SNEVCE WAY,Mighty boundary of Bulgaria.
2728,SNEVCE WAY,And below along the foothills
2729,SNEVCE WAY,"Ran the trenches of the Bulgar,"
2730,SNEVCE WAY,While a little to the westward
2731,SNEVCE WAY,"Lay the great round Lake of Doiran,"
2732,SNEVCE WAY,Gleaming like a polished mirror.
2733,SNEVCE WAY,
2734,SNEVCE WAY,"It was very fair to look on,"
2735,SNEVCE WAY,"Fair to gaze on from a distance,"
2736,SNEVCE WAY,Yet it struck a note of sadness
2737,SNEVCE WAY,In the heart of Tiadatha.
2738,SNEVCE WAY,Not a head of sheep or cattle
2739,SNEVCE WAY,"In that green and pleasant valley,"
2740,SNEVCE WAY,"Not a single vineyard tended,"
2741,SNEVCE WAY,"Not a single orchard tended,"
2742,SNEVCE WAY,Not a sign of habitation
2743,SNEVCE WAY,"In a single battered village,"
2744,SNEVCE WAY,Save sometimes the smoke uprising
2745,SNEVCE WAY,From the cookhouse of an outpost.
2746,SNEVCE WAY,"Yet the scene was fair to look on,"
2747,SNEVCE WAY,"Very like a landscape target,"
2748,SNEVCE WAY,And the Generals when they saw it
2749,SNEVCE WAY,Crowed with joy and beamed with pleasure—
2750,SNEVCE WAY,"“What a place for open warfare,"
2751,SNEVCE WAY,"What a place for raids!” they chirruped,"
2752,SNEVCE WAY,Safely perched upon the hill-tops.
2753,SNEVCE WAY,
2754,SNEVCE WAY,"Tiadatha sat and pondered,"
2755,SNEVCE WAY,"Pondered long upon the hillside,"
2756,SNEVCE WAY,Heaved a sigh of satisfaction
2757,SNEVCE WAY,When he thought that he was sitting
2758,SNEVCE WAY,"Well in view of all the Bulgars,"
2759,SNEVCE WAY,Knowing that they could not reach him
2760,SNEVCE WAY,With their field-guns on the Beles.
2761,SNEVCE WAY,
2762,SNEVCE WAY,As for fourteen months the Dudshires
2763,SNEVCE WAY,Hadn’t moved behind their field-guns
2764,SNEVCE WAY,"Save for concentrated training,"
2765,SNEVCE WAY,"They were charmed with Doya Tepe,"
2766,SNEVCE WAY,Found it like the open country
2767,SNEVCE WAY,After being in a tunnel.
2768,SNEVCE WAY,"Quite a pleasant spot for warfare,"
2769,SNEVCE WAY,"Really rather like the Picnic,"
2770,SNEVCE WAY,"Like the Salonica Picnic,"
2771,SNEVCE WAY,They had read of in the papers.
2772,SNEVCE WAY,
2773,SNEVCE WAY,"Still they had their job of watching,"
2774,SNEVCE WAY,"Watching for a raiding party,"
2775,SNEVCE WAY,"Guarding all their miles of frontage,"
2776,SNEVCE WAY,Every night on sentry duty
2777,SNEVCE WAY,"Or patrolling in the valley,"
2778,SNEVCE WAY,"Digging trenches in the daytime,"
2779,SNEVCE WAY,Or fatigues and wiring parties.
2780,SNEVCE WAY,But the crumps were far less frequent
2781,SNEVCE WAY,"And the gunners far less busy,"
2782,SNEVCE WAY,And it really was a blessing
2783,SNEVCE WAY,"To walk upright in the open,"
2784,SNEVCE WAY,"Caring not for pipsqueak merchants,"
2785,SNEVCE WAY,Caring not for hidden snipers.
2786,SNEVCE WAY,
2787,SNEVCE WAY,Sometimes Captain Tiadatha
2788,SNEVCE WAY,"Rode along his front line trenches,"
2789,SNEVCE WAY,Spent a useful morning shooting
2790,SNEVCE WAY,"Half a mile beyond the trenches,"
2791,SNEVCE WAY,Brought down several brace of partridge
2792,SNEVCE WAY,And a hare or two for dinner.
2793,SNEVCE WAY,Soon too he became acquainted
2794,SNEVCE WAY,With the small hotel at Snevce
2795,SNEVCE WAY,"(Foremost pub in Macedonia),"
2796,SNEVCE WAY,Where the food was quite delightful
2797,SNEVCE WAY,And the liquor even better;
2798,SNEVCE WAY,Where he spent some pleasant evenings
2799,SNEVCE WAY,"Very cheery, noisy evenings,"
2800,SNEVCE WAY,With a band of rowdy cronies
2801,SNEVCE WAY,From his own and other units.
2802,SNEVCE WAY,Soon he found his way to Kukus
2803,SNEVCE WAY,(Having made some generous allies
2804,SNEVCE WAY,"Who owned kite balloons and tenders),"
2805,SNEVCE WAY,"To that quaint and dirty village,"
2806,SNEVCE WAY,"Rising phœnix-like from ruins,"
2807,SNEVCE WAY,"Learnt the Greek for eggs was _avga_,"
2808,SNEVCE WAY,Haggled with the Kukus robbers
2809,SNEVCE WAY,"For a melon or a cabbage,"
2810,SNEVCE WAY,"Or an oke of tomatoes,"
2811,SNEVCE WAY,Bought some mats or bits of copper.
2812,SNEVCE WAY,"Watched the local comitadji,"
2813,SNEVCE WAY,"With their lady wives and daughters,"
2814,SNEVCE WAY,"In the glory of their war-paint,"
2815,SNEVCE WAY,"In their native Balkan costume,"
2816,SNEVCE WAY,"All the colours of the rainbow,"
2817,SNEVCE WAY,"Riding in upon their donkeys,"
2818,SNEVCE WAY,"On their clumsy bullock wagons,"
2819,SNEVCE WAY,Bringing in their goods to market.
2820,SNEVCE WAY,
2821,SNEVCE WAY,"Thus the summer slipped to autumn,"
2822,SNEVCE WAY,"Thus the autumn turned to winter,"
2823,SNEVCE WAY,And the winter found the Dudshires
2824,SNEVCE WAY,Still in Doya Tepe sector.
2825,SNEVCE WAY,"And their days rolled on as usual,"
2826,SNEVCE WAY,"Varied by a free excursion,"
2827,SNEVCE WAY,"By a morning raiding party,"
2828,SNEVCE WAY,To “maintain offensive spirit.”
2829,SNEVCE WAY,"And they got up sports and concerts,"
2830,SNEVCE WAY,Keeping for the most part cheerful;
2831,SNEVCE WAY,"Yet for all their songs and laughter,"
2832,SNEVCE WAY,"In each heart there lay a shadow,"
2833,SNEVCE WAY,"And in mess and hut and cookhouse,"
2834,SNEVCE WAY,"In the transport lines and trenches,"
2835,SNEVCE WAY,Talk turned ever on one topic—
2836,SNEVCE WAY,"When they’d get their leave to Blighty,"
2837,SNEVCE WAY,How they’d spend it when they got it.
2838,SNEVCE WAY,"And they passed the weary weeks by,"
2839,SNEVCE WAY,"Officers and private soldiers,"
2840,SNEVCE WAY,"Sighing for the leave they wanted,"
2841,SNEVCE WAY,"Leave that was so long in coming,"
2842,SNEVCE WAY,Sighing that it came no nearer.
2843,SNEVCE WAY,"Day and night they talked about it,"
2844,SNEVCE WAY,"Had one theme of conversation,"
2845,SNEVCE WAY,And that solitary topic
2846,SNEVCE WAY,"Ran through all their conversation,"
2847,SNEVCE WAY,"Like a pattern through a fabric,"
2848,SNEVCE WAY,A _leit motif_ through an opera—
2849,SNEVCE WAY,"When they’d get their leave to Blighty,"
2850,SNEVCE WAY,How they’d spend their leave to Blighty.

2861,A STUNT AT DAWN,
2862,A STUNT AT DAWN,
2863,A STUNT AT DAWN,In the month of bleak November
2864,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Said the Colonel of the Dudshires,"
2865,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Heart athirst for blood and battle,"
2866,A STUNT AT DAWN,"“We must have another outing,"
2867,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Do another stunt one morning,"
2868,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Raid that wood across the valley,"
2869,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Twist the Bulgars’ tails a little,"
2870,A STUNT AT DAWN,Bring some prisoners back to breakfast.”
2871,A STUNT AT DAWN,
2872,A STUNT AT DAWN,Picture then my Tiadatha
2873,A STUNT AT DAWN,Sitting in his draughty dug-out
2874,A STUNT AT DAWN,"At one-thirty in the morning,"
2875,A STUNT AT DAWN,Gulping tea and crunching bacon
2876,A STUNT AT DAWN,In an effort at a breakfast;
2877,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Picture him in Tommy’s tunic,"
2878,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Very oldest boots and breeches,"
2879,A STUNT AT DAWN,Girt with rifle and equipment
2880,A STUNT AT DAWN,Kindly lent him for the occasion
2881,A STUNT AT DAWN,"By his Quartermaster-Sergeant,"
2882,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Feeling rather apprehensive,"
2883,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Feeling very far from happy,"
2884,A STUNT AT DAWN,As he’d often felt on Sports days
2885,A STUNT AT DAWN,Ere he’d started for the hurdles.
2886,A STUNT AT DAWN,
2887,A STUNT AT DAWN,"To the fountain in the village,"
2888,A STUNT AT DAWN,"In the little ruined village,"
2889,A STUNT AT DAWN,Came the Dudshire raiding party
2890,A STUNT AT DAWN,And assembled in the starlight.
2891,A STUNT AT DAWN,Through the wire they wound in silence
2892,A STUNT AT DAWN,Like a mighty caterpillar
2893,A STUNT AT DAWN,(Silent save for Tiadatha
2894,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Strafing someone else for talking),"
2895,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Bayonets gleaming in the starlight,"
2896,A STUNT AT DAWN,Water-bottles gurgling softly
2897,A STUNT AT DAWN,"As they clumped along the pathway,"
2898,A STUNT AT DAWN,Clumped along towards Hodza River;
2899,A STUNT AT DAWN,At the ford they crossed the river
2900,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Splashing like a hippo bathing,"
2901,A STUNT AT DAWN,Gasping as it reached their tummies;
2902,A STUNT AT DAWN,"But it did not damp their ardour,"
2903,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Damped their feet but not their ardour,"
2904,A STUNT AT DAWN,And they staggered on in silence
2905,A STUNT AT DAWN,Now well into Bulgar country.
2906,A STUNT AT DAWN,
2907,A STUNT AT DAWN,As they skirted round an outpost
2908,A STUNT AT DAWN,Tiadatha’s heart grew fearful
2909,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Of inevitable star-shells,"
2910,A STUNT AT DAWN,Véry lights that seemed as certain
2911,A STUNT AT DAWN,As a howl is from a baby
2912,A STUNT AT DAWN,When he wakes up in the night-time:
2913,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Felt his heart go pitter-patter,"
2914,A STUNT AT DAWN,Knowing well how all depended
2915,A STUNT AT DAWN,On their getting past unnoticed;
2916,A STUNT AT DAWN,"But because a gale was blowing,"
2917,A STUNT AT DAWN,Or because the group was dreaming
2918,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Of its fairies in Sofia,"
2919,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Not a sound came from the outpost,"
2920,A STUNT AT DAWN,Not a rifle shot nor star-shell
2921,A STUNT AT DAWN,While the vanguard of the Dudshires
2922,A STUNT AT DAWN,Led the party through the darkness
2923,A STUNT AT DAWN,As a tug escorts a liner.
2924,A STUNT AT DAWN,
2925,A STUNT AT DAWN,Drawing near their dim objective
2926,A STUNT AT DAWN,"In the greyness of the morning,"
2927,A STUNT AT DAWN,"They deployed and at the signal,"
2928,A STUNT AT DAWN,"At the order of their Colonel,"
2929,A STUNT AT DAWN,Charged upon the Bulgar stronghold
2930,A STUNT AT DAWN,As the pearly dawn was breaking.
2931,A STUNT AT DAWN,
2932,A STUNT AT DAWN,"’Twould have made your heart beat faster,"
2933,A STUNT AT DAWN,"’Twould have set your blood a-tingle,"
2934,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Had you seen the Royal Dudshires,"
2935,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Seen that line of gallant Dudshires,"
2936,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Shake itself and charge like soldiers,"
2937,A STUNT AT DAWN,Go bald-headed for the Bulgars.
2938,A STUNT AT DAWN,Had you heard the Dudshires yelling
2939,A STUNT AT DAWN,Loud as rooters at a ball game
2940,A STUNT AT DAWN,"When they charged across the open,"
2941,A STUNT AT DAWN,"In their hearts that funny feeling,"
2942,A STUNT AT DAWN,Only brought about by three things—
2943,A STUNT AT DAWN,Love or rum or lust of battle.
2944,A STUNT AT DAWN,
2945,A STUNT AT DAWN,And by this time Johnny Bulgar
2946,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Was awake and taking notice,"
2947,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Sitting up and taking notice,"
2948,A STUNT AT DAWN,Potting at the charging Dudshires
2949,A STUNT AT DAWN,As they came across the open.
2950,A STUNT AT DAWN,"From behind the trees they potted,"
2951,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Potted from behind the bushes,"
2952,A STUNT AT DAWN,Made the puddles look like fountains
2953,A STUNT AT DAWN,In the greyness of the morning.
2954,A STUNT AT DAWN,"But the Dudshires, nothing daunted,"
2955,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Kept their line and never wavered,"
2956,A STUNT AT DAWN,At their head my Tiadatha.
2957,A STUNT AT DAWN,Closer still they came and closer
2958,A STUNT AT DAWN,Till the Bulgars saw their bayonets
2959,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Gleaming silver in the morning,"
2960,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Found that they could wait no longer,"
2961,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Through the wood they turned and legged it,"
2962,A STUNT AT DAWN,On their heels the panting Dudshires
2963,A STUNT AT DAWN,Led by breathless Tiadatha.
2964,A STUNT AT DAWN,
2965,A STUNT AT DAWN,You’d have cheered your very soul out
2966,A STUNT AT DAWN,Had you spotted Tiadatha
2967,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Rounding up a band of prisoners,"
2968,A STUNT AT DAWN,Setting off with Woggs his batman
2969,A STUNT AT DAWN,On a separate expedition
2970,A STUNT AT DAWN,After one more pet of Ferdie’s
2971,A STUNT AT DAWN,Who was hurriedly departing.
2972,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Hard and fast he chased that Bulgar,"
2973,A STUNT AT DAWN,Vainly loosing off his rifle
2974,A STUNT AT DAWN,"(Finding that it wasn’t loaded),"
2975,A STUNT AT DAWN,Vainly trying to remember
2976,A STUNT AT DAWN,What “Surrender” was in Bulgar.
2977,A STUNT AT DAWN,Wind was weak though spirit willing
2978,A STUNT AT DAWN,"And he never caught his quarry,"
2979,A STUNT AT DAWN,"For in spite of his equipment,"
2980,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Fancy boots and overcoating,"
2981,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Johnny legged it like a good ’un,"
2982,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Faster than a fighting woodcock,"
2983,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Swifter than a homing pigeon,"
2984,A STUNT AT DAWN,Leaving Woggs and Tiadatha
2985,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Cursing loudly in the distance,"
2986,A STUNT AT DAWN,With the slender consolation
2987,A STUNT AT DAWN,That they’d bagged a Bulgar rifle
2988,A STUNT AT DAWN,As memento of the picnic.
2989,A STUNT AT DAWN,
2990,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Thus they got their job of work done,"
2991,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Cleared the wood of Johnny Bulgar,"
2992,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Picked up all he’d left behind him,"
2993,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Even to his bits of breakfast,"
2994,A STUNT AT DAWN,And beheld with satisfaction
2995,A STUNT AT DAWN,(Crumps were getting rather busy)
2996,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Three red lights go soaring upwards,"
2997,A STUNT AT DAWN,Signal for them all to hop it.
2998,A STUNT AT DAWN,
2999,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Then without unseemly hurry,"
3000,A STUNT AT DAWN,Turkish cigarette in one hand
3001,A STUNT AT DAWN,"And a biscuit in the other,"
3002,A STUNT AT DAWN,Having passed his irksome rifle
3003,A STUNT AT DAWN,"On to Woggs the ever-suffering,"
3004,A STUNT AT DAWN,Tiadatha led his party
3005,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Back across the open country,"
3006,A STUNT AT DAWN,Led them back across the river
3007,A STUNT AT DAWN,While the zealous German gunners
3008,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Sprinkled all the plain with shrapnel,"
3009,A STUNT AT DAWN,Heaved a pious thanks to get them
3010,A STUNT AT DAWN,Back into the lines of safety.
3011,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Back in safety with their tails up,"
3012,A STUNT AT DAWN,Spent a pleasant twenty minutes
3013,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Watching prisoner birds arriving,"
3014,A STUNT AT DAWN,Dribbling back in pairs and bunches.
3015,A STUNT AT DAWN,"One especially he noticed,"
3016,A STUNT AT DAWN,Tunic destitute of buttons
3017,A STUNT AT DAWN,As a ration joint of suet
3018,A STUNT AT DAWN,"(Gone as souvenirs to Dudshire),"
3019,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Who yet clutched a set of buttons,"
3020,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Set of universal buttons,"
3021,A STUNT AT DAWN,Given to him as exchanges
3022,A STUNT AT DAWN,By his cheerful Dudshire captors.
3023,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Pockets bulging fat with Woodbines,"
3024,A STUNT AT DAWN,Woodbines that in Balkan trenches
3025,A STUNT AT DAWN,Are as scarce as lumps of sugar
3026,A STUNT AT DAWN,"On an English breakfast table,"
3027,A STUNT AT DAWN,Proof of Tommy’s pleasant manners
3028,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Towards the cove he’d tried to scupper,"
3029,A STUNT AT DAWN,Done his very best to scupper
3030,A STUNT AT DAWN,Early that November morning.
3031,A STUNT AT DAWN,
3032,A STUNT AT DAWN,Then my gleeful Tiadatha
3033,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Bade Woggs go and fetch his Kodak,"
3034,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Photographed the Bulgar prisoner,"
3035,A STUNT AT DAWN,Took him with the Sergeant-Major
3036,A STUNT AT DAWN,"And without the Sergeant-Major,"
3037,A STUNT AT DAWN,Cheered him up and pinched his cap badge
3038,A STUNT AT DAWN,"As a souvenir for Phyllis,"
3039,A STUNT AT DAWN,Gave him half a tin of bully.
3040,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Then he made a second breakfast,"
3041,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Made a mighty second breakfast,"
3042,A STUNT AT DAWN,Strolled into his little dug-out
3043,A STUNT AT DAWN,That he almost said good-bye to
3044,A STUNT AT DAWN,"When he left it in the morning,"
3045,A STUNT AT DAWN,"Bathed and got the grime of war off,"
3046,A STUNT AT DAWN,Laid him down and slept till evening
3047,A STUNT AT DAWN,As befitted a world’s worker.

3058,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3059,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3060,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"On a certain winter’s morning,"
3061,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Early on in 1918,"
3062,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Tiadatha had the tidings
3063,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Sudden as a tropic sunrise,"
3064,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Unbelievable as winning
3065,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Something in a comic raffle,"
3066,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,That he’d got his leave to England;
3067,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And although the snow was falling
3068,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"On that Balkan winter’s morning,"
3069,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"All the world seemed full of sunshine,"
3070,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"All the world seemed bright and golden,"
3071,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And he felt as effervescing
3072,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"As a fizzing glass of bubbly,"
3073,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Felt as though a lovely fairy,"
3074,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Ever cold and stony-hearted,"
3075,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Finally had come and kissed him.
3076,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3077,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,So my joyous Tiadatha
3078,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Made some frenzied preparations,"
3079,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Got some odds and ends together,"
3080,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Said good-bye to everybody,"
3081,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Said good-bye to Woggs his batman,"
3082,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Trusty Woggs the ever-ready,"
3083,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Wishing he was coming also,"
3084,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Wishing everyone was coming.
3085,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Started on that blessed journey,"
3086,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"On that wonderful adventure,"
3087,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"“To proceed on leave to England,”"
3088,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And one grey and misty morning
3089,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Steamed away from Salonica
3090,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,From Constantinople station
3091,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,With some other lucky blighters.
3092,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3093,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And it didn’t seem to matter
3094,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"That the carriage floor was filthy,"
3095,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"That the seats were void of cushions,"
3096,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,That the window glass was broken.
3097,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,It was quite enough to know that
3098,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"They were leaving Salonica,"
3099,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Quaint old dirty Salonica,"
3100,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And the mud of Macedonia
3101,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"And the everlasting hillsides,"
3102,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,After what seemed countless ages—
3103,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Quite enough for Tiadatha
3104,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"To see Salonica fading,"
3105,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Growing fainter in the distance.
3106,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3107,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"All day long the leave train jolted,"
3108,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"All night long it rocked and jolted,"
3109,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Crawling on through Greece to Bralo,"
3110,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Halting only at Larissa.
3111,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"And the R.T.O., Larissa,"
3112,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Very kind and very courteous,"
3113,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Welcomed Tiadatha’s party,"
3114,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Took them over to his billet,"
3115,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Gave them steaming tea at midnight,"
3116,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Like the whitest brand of white man.
3117,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Then at seven in the morning
3118,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"They detrained at Bralo station,"
3119,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Bleary-eyed, unshaved and grimy."
3120,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Went by lorry to the Rest Camp,"
3121,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Bathed and shaved and had some breakfast,"
3122,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Felt just like a piece of silver
3123,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,When it’s made to shine with Goddard’s
3124,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,After being badly tarnished.
3125,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3126,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"On they went from Bralo Rest Camp,"
3127,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,On they went by motor lorry
3128,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Up the road across the mountains,"
3129,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Up the road that twirled and twisted
3130,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Like a pirouetting dancer.
3131,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"As they reached the mountain summit,"
3132,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Started downwards to Itea,"
3133,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Very lovely was the picture
3134,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Spread before my Tiadatha.
3135,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Rugged hills and deep-cleft valleys,"
3136,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Here and there a golden village,"
3137,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Far below, the olive gardens,"
3138,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"And beyond them, blue as turquoise,"
3139,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Lay the sunny Gulf of Corinth.
3140,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And all Tiadatha’s comrades
3141,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Murmured “Oh, by Jove, how lovely!”"
3142,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"“Take it all,” said Tiadatha,"
3143,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,“Take it all and more beside it.
3144,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"I would give you every mountain,"
3145,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Every olive grove and village,"
3146,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"And the whole damn Gulf of Corinth,"
3147,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"For a glimpse of England’s coastline,"
3148,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,For a glimpse of Piccadilly.”
3149,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3150,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Soon they reached Itea village,"
3151,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Put up at the local Rest Camp,"
3152,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,At the ever-present Rest Camp.
3153,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Spent three warm and sunny days there,"
3154,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And my happy Tiadatha
3155,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Quickly found a kindred spirit,"
3156,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Found a red tabbed gunner captain,"
3157,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Wandered with him round the village
3158,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"That lay sleepy in the sunlight,"
3159,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Yet awake to pouch the drachmae
3160,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Of the passing British soldier.
3161,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"And they rowed out to an island,"
3162,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Lay and watched the sea for ages
3163,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Underneath a cloudless heaven,"
3164,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"With a pleasant sense of freedom,"
3165,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Sense of having slipped the handcuffs
3166,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Of the army for a little.
3167,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Did a bit of tripperising,"
3168,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Went to see the sights of Delphi,"
3169,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Delphi in its ancient splendour,"
3170,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"In the ruins of its splendour,"
3171,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Standing high upon the hillside,"
3172,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Looking on the Gulf of Corinth.
3173,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Wandered round and saw the Oracle,"
3174,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Wandered round and saw the Stadium,"
3175,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Where of old the Greeks ran races;
3176,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Toed the mark and ran a hundred,"
3177,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"To the wonder of some Frenchmen,"
3178,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Who were also tripperising.
3179,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3180,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Then one afternoon the leave boat
3181,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Steamed into the tiny harbour,"
3182,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And at dawn the morning after
3183,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Bore rejoicing Tiadatha
3184,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And his party off to Taranto.
3185,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Every time the steamer’s screw turned,"
3186,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Every single knot she covered,"
3187,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Tiadatha felt his heart thrill,"
3188,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Felt his England drawing nearer,"
3189,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Felt St. James’s drawing nearer,"
3190,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And the things he loved so well there.
3191,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And they dodged the lurking U-boats
3192,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"That were hanging round like footpads,"
3193,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Came to anchor at Taranto,"
3194,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"In Taranto’s crowded harbour,"
3195,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Where the seaplanes skim like seagulls
3196,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,O’er the surface of the water.
3197,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Disembarked and found the Rest Camp,"
3198,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Yet another Army Rest Camp,"
3199,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Sumptuous to Tiadatha
3200,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"After those of Macedonia,"
3201,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Which had usually consisted
3202,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Of a dozen flapping bell tents,"
3203,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Pitched upon a windy hillside.
3204,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3205,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"And they found Taranto crowded,"
3206,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Crawling with expensive Generals
3207,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Waiting for their turn with others.
3208,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Vanished were their hopes of Rapide,"
3209,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Hopes of going on by Rapide,"
3210,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Seeing Rome and seeing Paris.
3211,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"“Never mind,” said Tiadatha,"
3212,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"To the red-tabbed gunner captain,"
3213,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"“Every day we hang about here,"
3214,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Every day the journey’s lengthened,"
3215,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Means a day of warfare over,"
3216,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Means the end a little nearer.”
3217,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"So they sojourned at the Rest Camp,"
3218,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Loafed about and wrote some letters,"
3219,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Patronised the bar when open,"
3220,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Quaffing Bass again with gusto,"
3221,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And at six o’clock one evening
3222,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Started on the daily troop train,"
3223,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Started on their journey Northwards.
3224,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3225,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Very wisely Tiadatha
3226,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,And his friend the gunner captain
3227,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Went and bagged a carriage early,"
3228,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Went and bagged a first-class carriage
3229,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,That had still some cushions in it
3230,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"And some glass left in the windows,"
3231,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Chalked up “Captain Tiadatha
3232,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"And three officers” upon it,"
3233,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Got two merchants who were going
3234,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"One night only on the journey,"
3235,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,After which they shared the carriage
3236,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Tiadatha and the gunner.
3237,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3238,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Early every day they halted,"
3239,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Washed in buckets by the trainside,"
3240,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Shaved and strolled about a little,"
3241,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Sometimes snatched a hurried breakfast
3242,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,At the buffet of a station.
3243,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Spent the long, long days in reading,"
3244,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Pulling mutual friends to pieces,"
3245,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Talking over raids and battles,"
3246,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Talking over all their leave plans,"
3247,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Ate their very sketchy luncheons,"
3248,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Ate their very uncouth dinners,"
3249,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Cleaned their plates with bits of paper,"
3250,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Cleaned their knives and forks with paper,"
3251,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Living in acute discomfort,"
3252,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Pigging as they’d seldom pigged it,"
3253,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Turning out sometimes at Rest Camps
3254,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Just to stretch their legs a little,"
3255,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Have a bath and get some dinner.
3256,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Every night they got a fug up,"
3257,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Got a most uncommon fug up,"
3258,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Boarded up the broken windows,"
3259,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Lighted quite a dozen candles.
3260,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"All along the rack they stuck them,"
3261,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Stuck them on the greasy arm-rests,"
3262,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Got the carriage warm and cosy,"
3263,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Then unrolled their fat valises,"
3264,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Slept beneath a pile of blankets
3265,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Soundly as a pair of kittens.
3266,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Thus nine days and nights they travelled,"
3267,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"All through Italy they travelled,"
3268,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Found at Havre their troopship waiting,"
3269,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Sailed at dusk upon the troopship,"
3270,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Sailed all night without adventure.
3271,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,
3272,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,As the dawn broke Tiadatha
3273,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Saw the coast of England rising
3274,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Through the misty winter’s morning,"
3275,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Felt his heart go beating wildly
3276,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"As when lover meets his mistress,"
3277,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Longed to kiss his lovely England,"
3278,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Take her in his arms and kiss her,"
3279,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,As a son might kiss his mother.
3280,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,"Got ashore and humped his kit off,"
3281,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Then went streaking up to London
3282,LEAVE TO ENGLAND,Making for his loved St. James’s.

3304,HOME AT LAST,Thus it greeted Tiadatha
3305,HOME AT LAST,"Very much the same as ever,"
3306,HOME AT LAST,"Though he found a dearth of porters,"
3307,HOME AT LAST,"Found it hard to get a porter,"
3308,HOME AT LAST,Harder still to get a taxi.
3309,HOME AT LAST,
3310,HOME AT LAST,"Who can tell of that first journey,"
3311,HOME AT LAST,"That first taxi drive in London,"
3312,HOME AT LAST,"Of the exile from the trenches,"
3313,HOME AT LAST,Of the wanderer returning—
3314,HOME AT LAST,Almost every street and building
3315,HOME AT LAST,Bringing back a recollection
3316,HOME AT LAST,Like a long-forgotten perfume?
3317,HOME AT LAST,
3318,HOME AT LAST,As a soldier to the canteen
3319,HOME AT LAST,"After his parade is over,"
3320,HOME AT LAST,Even so sped Tiadatha
3321,HOME AT LAST,Straightway to his club in Pall Mall.
3322,HOME AT LAST,"And the porter in the hallway,"
3323,HOME AT LAST,"White and very old retainer,"
3324,HOME AT LAST,"Imperturbable as marble,"
3325,HOME AT LAST,"Changeless as a ration biscuit,"
3326,HOME AT LAST,Gave his usual morning greeting
3327,HOME AT LAST,Just as if it were but two days
3328,HOME AT LAST,"Since he’d seen my Tiadatha,"
3329,HOME AT LAST,Not two weary years and over.
3330,HOME AT LAST,And it seemed to Tiadatha
3331,HOME AT LAST,That somehow the porter’s greeting
3332,HOME AT LAST,"Bridged those weary years of exile,"
3333,HOME AT LAST,"Helped him pick the threads of life up,"
3334,HOME AT LAST,Feel he’d been away but two days
3335,HOME AT LAST,Not two weary years and over.
3336,HOME AT LAST,
3337,HOME AT LAST,"After lunch he doffed his khaki,"
3338,HOME AT LAST,"Dived into a suit of mufti,"
3339,HOME AT LAST,Felt his leave had really started
3340,HOME AT LAST,"As he sauntered to St. James’s,"
3341,HOME AT LAST,Bound for Jermyn Street and Hammam’s.
3342,HOME AT LAST,"Had a Turkish bath at Hammam’s,"
3343,HOME AT LAST,"Came out feeling clean and happy,"
3344,HOME AT LAST,Spotless as a British cruiser
3345,HOME AT LAST,"On a sunny Sunday morning,"
3346,HOME AT LAST,Fresh as any London pavement
3347,HOME AT LAST,"After summer rains have washed it,"
3348,HOME AT LAST,Hair well brushed and very sleeky.
3349,HOME AT LAST,"Hat at just the proper angle,"
3350,HOME AT LAST,"Suit of grey and gloves of buckskin,"
3351,HOME AT LAST,"Socks as soothing as a moonbeam,"
3352,HOME AT LAST,And a tie of Dudshire colours.
3353,HOME AT LAST,
3354,HOME AT LAST,And the sights and smells of London
3355,HOME AT LAST,"All seemed good to Tiadatha,"
3356,HOME AT LAST,"Every shop he saw allured him,"
3357,HOME AT LAST,Every face he passed was lovely.
3358,HOME AT LAST,So he wandered for a little
3359,HOME AT LAST,"And inhaled his well-loved London,"
3360,HOME AT LAST,Let it steal upon his senses
3361,HOME AT LAST,As a Chinaman with hashish.
3362,HOME AT LAST,"“Life again” thought Tiadatha,"
3363,HOME AT LAST,"Rumpelmeyer’s instead of Floca’s,"
3364,HOME AT LAST,"Hammam’s baths instead of Botton’s,"
3365,HOME AT LAST,And the Club instead of Rest Camps.
3366,HOME AT LAST,"For three little weeks I’ve got them,"
3367,HOME AT LAST,Swapped the Skating Rink for Murray’s
3368,HOME AT LAST,Swapped the Tour Blanche for the Empire.
3369,HOME AT LAST,"Swapped the Luxe Hotel for Carlton,"
3370,HOME AT LAST,And the shops of Rue Egnatia
3371,HOME AT LAST,"For the Burlington and Bond Street,"
3372,HOME AT LAST,And old Salonica’s cobbles
3373,HOME AT LAST,For the pavement of St. James’s.
3374,HOME AT LAST,
3375,HOME AT LAST,Then he hied him to his tailor
3376,HOME AT LAST,"(Who was very pleased to see him),"
3377,HOME AT LAST,Tried on slacks and tried on tunics
3378,HOME AT LAST,"And a pair of wondrous breeches,"
3379,HOME AT LAST,And a pleasant suit of mufti
3380,HOME AT LAST,That were ready waiting for him.
3381,HOME AT LAST,"Then to Mr. Wing he hastened,"
3382,HOME AT LAST,Mr. Wing of Piccadilly
3383,HOME AT LAST,"(Who was just as pleased to see him),"
3384,HOME AT LAST,"Rioted in ties and hankies,"
3385,HOME AT LAST,"Shirts and gloves and silk pyjamas,"
3386,HOME AT LAST,"Socks of many shades and colours,"
3387,HOME AT LAST,"Put the whole lot down to Father,"
3388,HOME AT LAST,Recking little of the future.
3389,HOME AT LAST,
3390,HOME AT LAST,"After that he hailed a taxi,"
3391,HOME AT LAST,Bade the driver make for Sloane Street
3392,HOME AT LAST,And the home of green-eyed Phyllis;
3393,HOME AT LAST,Found his heart was beating faster
3394,HOME AT LAST,Than a Lewis gun in action
3395,HOME AT LAST,As he knocked upon the front door.
3396,HOME AT LAST,
3397,HOME AT LAST,"She was still the same as ever,"
3398,HOME AT LAST,"Tiadatha’s green-eyed Phyllis,"
3399,HOME AT LAST,"Still as sweet and slim and slender,"
3400,HOME AT LAST,Slim and slender as his sword was.
3401,HOME AT LAST,"And her eyes were still like April,"
3402,HOME AT LAST,"Green and grey as days in April,"
3403,HOME AT LAST,"And her mouth still curved like roses,"
3404,HOME AT LAST,And her smile was still like sunshine
3405,HOME AT LAST,Playing on the Thames at Chelsea
3406,HOME AT LAST,Early on a summer morning.
3407,HOME AT LAST,"Still the same yet somehow different,"
3408,HOME AT LAST,"Somehow deeper, somehow truer,"
3409,HOME AT LAST,"Tested by those years of waiting,"
3410,HOME AT LAST,"By those two long years of waiting,"
3411,HOME AT LAST,"Less of girl and more of woman,"
3412,HOME AT LAST,And her eyes were very tender
3413,HOME AT LAST,As she kissed my Tiadatha.
3414,HOME AT LAST,
3415,HOME AT LAST,"And that night they dined at Prince’s,"
3416,HOME AT LAST,Tiadatha very happy
3417,HOME AT LAST,Sitting at his wonted table
3418,HOME AT LAST,"In black tie and dinner jacket,"
3419,HOME AT LAST,Gleaming shirt and glossy collar;
3420,HOME AT LAST,"Phyllis radiant, very lovely,"
3421,HOME AT LAST,"In a frock of grey and silver,"
3422,HOME AT LAST,"Soft and clinging as a shadow,"
3423,HOME AT LAST,"Pearly as the mists of morning,"
3424,HOME AT LAST,Touched with violet like a sunrise
3425,HOME AT LAST,(Who am I to tell you of it?)
3426,HOME AT LAST,With some tiny silver tassels
3427,HOME AT LAST,Hanging down like shafts of moonlight.
3428,HOME AT LAST,"And her eyes like stars were shining,"
3429,HOME AT LAST,"Like stars on a frosty evening,"
3430,HOME AT LAST,As she talked to Tiadatha.
3431,HOME AT LAST,
3432,HOME AT LAST,And the glinting dinner table
3433,HOME AT LAST,"And the shaded lights and music,"
3434,HOME AT LAST,And the buzz of conversation
3435,HOME AT LAST,Of the gay and laughing people
3436,HOME AT LAST,Were like wine to Tiadatha.
3437,HOME AT LAST,And he raised his glass of bubbly
3438,HOME AT LAST,Looking towards his green-eyed Phyllis.
3439,HOME AT LAST,"“Here’s a toast,” quoth Tiadatha,"
3440,HOME AT LAST,“Here’s to the two things I love most—
3441,HOME AT LAST,"London Town in peace and war time,"
3442,HOME AT LAST,Coupled with the name of Phyllis.
3443,HOME AT LAST,"This is better than the Splendide,"
3444,HOME AT LAST,"This is better than the French Club,"
3445,HOME AT LAST,Better than a farewell dinner
3446,HOME AT LAST,"In a dug-out in the trenches,"
3447,HOME AT LAST,"London Town in peace and war time,"
3448,HOME AT LAST,Nothing in the world to touch you—
3449,HOME AT LAST,"Damn the air-raids, damn the coupons,"
3450,HOME AT LAST,Damn the lack of meat and sugar.
3451,HOME AT LAST,"Two long years I’ve waited for you,"
3452,HOME AT LAST,"After two long years I’ve got you,"
3453,HOME AT LAST,London and my green-eyed Phyllis.”
3454,HOME AT LAST,
3455,HOME AT LAST,So they lingered over dinner
3456,HOME AT LAST,As a lover reads a letter
3457,HOME AT LAST,Lest the end should come too quickly.
3458,HOME AT LAST,"Then he bore her to the Gaiety,"
3459,HOME AT LAST,And the joyous Tiadatha
3460,HOME AT LAST,"In his comfy green stall nestling,"
3461,HOME AT LAST,Hooted with infectious laughter
3462,HOME AT LAST,"Like a schoolboy at a panto,"
3463,HOME AT LAST,Clapped the songs and jokes and dances
3464,HOME AT LAST,As he’d never done in peace time.
3465,HOME AT LAST,"Happy still when it was over,"
3466,HOME AT LAST,Thinking of the dance and Murray’s—
3467,HOME AT LAST,"Sped there in a wangled taxi,"
3468,HOME AT LAST,All too soon fetched up at Murray’s.
3469,HOME AT LAST,"Murray’s just the same as ever,"
3470,HOME AT LAST,"Murray’s with the same old fug up,"
3471,HOME AT LAST,"Like an aggravated hothouse,"
3472,HOME AT LAST,Just the same appalling prices
3473,HOME AT LAST,For a jug of Murray’s Mixture.
3474,HOME AT LAST,Many well-remembered faces
3475,HOME AT LAST,Round the little close-packed tables
3476,HOME AT LAST,With their many-coloured night-lights.
3477,HOME AT LAST,"Same old floor that gleamed like honey,"
3478,HOME AT LAST,Same old priceless band of niggers
3479,HOME AT LAST,"Playing rag-time, playing fox-trots"
3480,HOME AT LAST,As no other band could play them.
3481,HOME AT LAST,
3482,HOME AT LAST,"And they danced and danced together,"
3483,HOME AT LAST,"Phyllis and my Tiadatha,"
3484,HOME AT LAST,As upon that summer evening
3485,HOME AT LAST,When at first they met each other—
3486,HOME AT LAST,"Till the nigger band departed,"
3487,HOME AT LAST,"Till the waiters all grew restive,"
3488,HOME AT LAST,Phyllis danced with Tiadatha.
3489,HOME AT LAST,
3490,HOME AT LAST,Happy days are short as kisses
3491,HOME AT LAST,"Snatched when someone else is coming,"
3492,HOME AT LAST,Happy days end always quickly
3493,HOME AT LAST,But in war time even quicker
3494,HOME AT LAST,Than they used to do in peace time.
3495,HOME AT LAST,Bitterly my Tiadatha
3496,HOME AT LAST,Cursed the fate that sent him homewards
3497,HOME AT LAST,"Ere the pearly dawn was breaking,"
3498,HOME AT LAST,Ere the workmen’s trains were running.
3499,HOME AT LAST,"But he knew Fate is remorseless,"
3500,HOME AT LAST,Knew that Dora is remorseless
3501,HOME AT LAST,As the chucker out at Murray’s.
3502,HOME AT LAST,"So by dint of shoving, pushing,"
3503,HOME AT LAST,"Begging, bribing and cajoling,"
3504,HOME AT LAST,"He induced a taxi-driver,"
3505,HOME AT LAST,"Most elusive, very lordly,"
3506,HOME AT LAST,To unbend enough to take them
3507,HOME AT LAST,(At a price) as far as Sloane Street.
3508,HOME AT LAST,
3509,HOME AT LAST,"In that hard-won London taxi,"
3510,HOME AT LAST,Speeding down dim Piccadilly
3511,HOME AT LAST,On its way to darkened Sloane Street
3512,HOME AT LAST,I will leave my Tiadatha
3513,HOME AT LAST,On his first sweet night in England—
3514,HOME AT LAST,"Leave him feeling very happy,"
3515,HOME AT LAST,"Drugged with a divine contentment,"
3516,HOME AT LAST,Feeling life was paying interest
3517,HOME AT LAST,On the days he had invested
3518,HOME AT LAST,In those dreary Balkan trenches.
3519,HOME AT LAST,Leave him with the things he’d ached for
3520,HOME AT LAST,"In those two long years of exile,"
3521,HOME AT LAST,Leave him to his well-loved London
3522,HOME AT LAST,And the arms of green-eyed Phyllis.
3523,HOME AT LAST,
3524,HOME AT LAST,*       *       *       *       *
3525,HOME AT LAST,
3526,HOME AT LAST,"Should you question, should you ask me"
3527,HOME AT LAST,What became of Tiadatha;
3528,HOME AT LAST,"Ask me if he married Phyllis,"
3529,HOME AT LAST,"If he found another fairy,"
3530,HOME AT LAST,"Found one even more alluring,"
3531,HOME AT LAST,Eyes of brown or blue or violet;
3532,HOME AT LAST,If he sailed for Salonica
3533,HOME AT LAST,Still an unrepentant bachelor;
3534,HOME AT LAST,Should you ask me of his doings
3535,HOME AT LAST,"After those three weeks were ended,"
3536,HOME AT LAST,One mad rush and wild excitement;
3537,HOME AT LAST,If he got a cushy staff job
3538,HOME AT LAST,"With a lot of tabs about it,"
3539,HOME AT LAST,Or if he became a major
3540,HOME AT LAST,"Or the Colonel of the Dudshires,"
3541,HOME AT LAST,I should make reply and answer—
3542,HOME AT LAST,“Who am I that I should tell you?
3543,HOME AT LAST,I have brought my Tiadatha
3544,HOME AT LAST,Back again to where he started
3545,HOME AT LAST,(Just as if he had been travelling
3546,HOME AT LAST,"On a kind of Inner Circle),"
3547,HOME AT LAST,"Safe and sound and still light-hearted,"
3548,HOME AT LAST,Still the same yet somehow different.
3549,HOME AT LAST,You remember how I found him
3550,HOME AT LAST,In July of 1914
3551,HOME AT LAST,Toying with his devilled kidneys
3552,HOME AT LAST,At his little flat in Duke Street;
3553,HOME AT LAST,"Very tired and very nut-like,"
3554,HOME AT LAST,What we used to call a “filbert.”
3555,HOME AT LAST,"I have told you of his training,"
3556,HOME AT LAST,"I have told you of his troubles,"
3557,HOME AT LAST,"Of his trials and his travels,"
3558,HOME AT LAST,Of some happenings that befell him.
3559,HOME AT LAST,I have tried to picture to you
3560,HOME AT LAST,How he lived and laughed and battled
3561,HOME AT LAST,"Out in France and Salonica,"
3562,HOME AT LAST,How he changed from nut to soldier
3563,HOME AT LAST,As a sword is tried and tempered
3564,HOME AT LAST,"When it passes through the furnace,"
3565,HOME AT LAST,How he learnt (with many like him)
3566,HOME AT LAST,"Something of the things that matter,"
3567,HOME AT LAST,Life and Death and high endeavour.
3568,HOME AT LAST,How he learnt (with many like him)
3569,HOME AT LAST,That you cannot love your country
3570,HOME AT LAST,Till you’ve left it far behind you
3571,HOME AT LAST,(Just as no one loved his sugar
3572,HOME AT LAST,Till the beastly stuff was rationed);
3573,HOME AT LAST,"That you cannot know its pleasures,"
3574,HOME AT LAST,"Cannot love its charms and comforts,"
3575,HOME AT LAST,Till you’ve sampled several others.
3576,HOME AT LAST,
3577,HOME AT LAST,"“In this war the Hun has brought us,"
3578,HOME AT LAST,"Some have learnt to make returns out,"
3579,HOME AT LAST,Some have learnt to write out orders.
3580,HOME AT LAST,"Some have learnt the way to kill Huns,"
3581,HOME AT LAST,"Some to lead the men that kill them,"
3582,HOME AT LAST,"Some have learnt to cope with bully,"
3583,HOME AT LAST,"Learnt to shave with army razors,"
3584,HOME AT LAST,"Learnt to make the best of blizzards,"
3585,HOME AT LAST,"Mud and slush and blazing sunshine,"
3586,HOME AT LAST,Learnt to coax a little comfort
3587,HOME AT LAST,"Out of bivvies, barns and dug-outs,"
3588,HOME AT LAST,Learnt of things they never dreamed of
3589,HOME AT LAST,In July of 1914.
3590,HOME AT LAST,
3591,HOME AT LAST,"“And they all have learnt this lesson,"
3592,HOME AT LAST,"Learnt as well this common lesson,"
3593,HOME AT LAST,Learnt to hold a little dearer
3594,HOME AT LAST,All the things they took for granted
3595,HOME AT LAST,In July of 1914—
3596,HOME AT LAST,"Whether it be Scottish Highlands,"
3597,HOME AT LAST,"Hills of Wales or banks of Ireland,"
3598,HOME AT LAST,"Or the swelling downs of Dudshire,"
3599,HOME AT LAST,Or the pavement of St. James’s—
3600,HOME AT LAST,Even so my Tiadatha.
3601,HOME AT LAST,
3602,HOME AT LAST,“So I leave him and salute him
3603,HOME AT LAST,"Back in his beloved London,"
3604,HOME AT LAST,Knowing that the war has one thing
3605,HOME AT LAST,(If no others) to its credit—
3606,HOME AT LAST,"It has made a nut a soldier,"
3607,HOME AT LAST,"Made a silk purse from a sow’s ear,"
3608,HOME AT LAST,Made a man of Tiadatha
3609,HOME AT LAST,And made men of hundreds like him.
3610,HOME AT LAST,
3611,HOME AT LAST,“And the world has cause to thank us
3612,HOME AT LAST,"For that band of so-called filberts,"
3613,HOME AT LAST,"For those products of St. James’s,"
3614,HOME AT LAST,"Light of heart and much enduring,"
3615,HOME AT LAST,"Straight and debonair and dauntless,"
3616,HOME AT LAST,"Grousing at their small discomforts,"
3617,HOME AT LAST,Smiling in the face of danger.
3618,HOME AT LAST,"Who have faced their great adventure,"
3619,HOME AT LAST,"Crossed through No Man’s Land to meet it,"
3620,HOME AT LAST,Lightly as they’d cross St. James’s.
3621,HOME AT LAST,"Eyes and heart still full of laughter,"
3622,HOME AT LAST,"Till the world had cause to wonder,"
3623,HOME AT LAST,Till the world had cause to thank us
3624,HOME AT LAST,For the likes of Tiadatha.”
