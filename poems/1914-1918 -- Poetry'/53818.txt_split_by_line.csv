241,FALLEN,"The years shall dim his face, our fleeting sight"
242,FALLEN,Shall see his splendid image fade away
243,FALLEN,Beyond the knowledge of our drifting thought
244,FALLEN,"Which moves in circles to the source again,"
245,FALLEN,Beyond dark seas with shivering stars inwrought
246,FALLEN,Beyond war-burdened men in stricken pain.
247,FALLEN,
248,FALLEN,I searched in rage and passionate despair
249,FALLEN,"Down winding paths of thought, and comradeless"
250,FALLEN,In the full surge and tumult where he died

263,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,Night held me as I crawled and scrambled near
264,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"The Turkish lines. Above, the mocking stars"
265,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"Silvered the curving parapet, and clear"
266,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,Cloud-latticed beams o’erflecked the land with bars
267,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"I, crouching, lay between"
268,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"Tense-listening armies peering through the night,"
269,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,Twin giants bound by tentacles unseen.
270,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,Here in dim-shadowed light
271,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"I saw him, as a sudden movement turned"
272,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"His eyes towards me, glowing eyes that burned"
273,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,A moment ere his snuffling muzzle found
274,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,My trail; and then as serpents mesmerise
275,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"He chained me with those unrelenting eyes,"
276,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"That muscle-sliding rhythm, knit and bound"
277,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"In spare-limbed symmetry, those perfect jaws"
278,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,And soft-approaching pitter-patter paws.
279,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,Nearer and nearer like a wolf he crept--
280,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,That moment had my swift revolver leapt--
281,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"But terror seized me, terror born of shame"
282,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,Brought flooding revelation. For he came
283,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"As one who offers comradeship deserved,"
284,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,"An open ally of the human race,"
285,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,And sniffing at my prostrate form unnerved
286,THE TURKISH TRENCH DOG,He licked my face!

292,THE SENTINEL,
293,THE SENTINEL,_An Episode at the Evacuation of Gallipoli._
294,THE SENTINEL,
295,THE SENTINEL,
296,THE SENTINEL,He stood enveloped in the darkening mist
297,THE SENTINEL,High on the cape that proudly kept her tryst
298,THE SENTINEL,Above the narrow portal. All the day
299,THE SENTINEL,White shell-flung water-spouts had scattered spray
300,THE SENTINEL,"Round Helles, warden of the Eastern seas;"
301,THE SENTINEL,And still the boom of Asian batteries
302,THE SENTINEL,Rumbled around the cape. The sentinel
303,THE SENTINEL,Spied from his high cliff-towered citadel
304,THE SENTINEL,The leaping flash of guns; but ere the roar
305,THE SENTINEL,"Sprang from its den on the dim Asian shore,"
306,THE SENTINEL,"He blew a trumpet. Then, like burrowing moles,"
307,THE SENTINEL,"Dim forms below dashed headlong to their holes,"
308,THE SENTINEL,"The while that hurtling iron crossed the sea,"
309,THE SENTINEL,And fifteen seconds seemed eternity.
310,THE SENTINEL,Below we lay
311,THE SENTINEL,Crushed in a lighter; and the towering spray
312,THE SENTINEL,That lately blurred the clear star-laden sea
313,THE SENTINEL,Subsided in the vast tranquillity.
314,THE SENTINEL,"Now, chafing like taut-muscled charioteers"
315,THE SENTINEL,"With every sense on tiptoe, we strained ears"
316,THE SENTINEL,"For whispers, or the catch of indrawn breath."
317,THE SENTINEL,Still not the word to cut adrift the rope
318,THE SENTINEL,That moored us to a wharf of floating piers:
319,THE SENTINEL,And thus alternately in fear and hope
320,THE SENTINEL,Swung the grim pendulum of life and death.
321,THE SENTINEL,
322,THE SENTINEL,Then suddenly the sound
323,THE SENTINEL,Of that loud warning rang the cape around.
324,THE SENTINEL,"We knew a gun had flashed, we knew the roar"
325,THE SENTINEL,That instant rumbled from the Asian shore;
326,THE SENTINEL,And we lie fettered to a raft!... The shell
327,THE SENTINEL,"Climbs its high trajectory ... Well,"
328,THE SENTINEL,What of it? Fifteen seconds less or more
329,THE SENTINEL,One--two--three--four--five--six--seven
330,THE SENTINEL,"(Steady, man,"
331,THE SENTINEL,It’s only Asiatic Ann) ...
332,THE SENTINEL,How slow the moments trickle--eight--nine--ten
333,THE SENTINEL,"(They’re wonderful, these men)."
334,THE SENTINEL,Am I a coward? I can count no more;
335,THE SENTINEL,"Hold Thou my hands, O God."
336,THE SENTINEL,
337,THE SENTINEL,"The sea, upheaved in anger, rocked and swirled;"
338,THE SENTINEL,Niagara seemed pelting from the stars
339,THE SENTINEL,In tumult that epitomised a world
340,THE SENTINEL,Roused by the battling impotence of wars.
341,THE SENTINEL,"We heard a whispered order to escape,"
342,THE SENTINEL,"And casting loose, incredulously free,"
343,THE SENTINEL,"Unscathed, exulting in the amber light"
344,THE SENTINEL,We left behind the immemorial cape.
345,THE SENTINEL,
346,THE SENTINEL,But still above the indomitable sea
347,THE SENTINEL,From his high cliff a sentry watched the night
348,THE SENTINEL,
349,THE SENTINEL,

353,MUDROS AFTER THE EVACUATION,
354,MUDROS AFTER THE EVACUATION,
355,MUDROS AFTER THE EVACUATION,I laughed to see the gulls that dipped to cling
356,MUDROS AFTER THE EVACUATION,"To the torn edge of surf and blowing spray,"
357,MUDROS AFTER THE EVACUATION,"Where some gaunt battleship, a rolling king,"
358,MUDROS AFTER THE EVACUATION,Still dreams of phantom battles in the bay.
359,MUDROS AFTER THE EVACUATION,"I saw a cloud, a full-blown cotton flower"

401,MISSING,Irresolute. Yet I again could be
402,MISSING,"Mistress of life, Queen of my destiny,"
403,MISSING,If I but knew--But now Remembrance plays
404,MISSING,My being back through spring and summer days
405,MISSING,We passed together; and I see him still
406,MISSING,Swinging to meet me down the tardy hill.
407,MISSING,That day the birds were new-inspired; a breeze
408,MISSING,"Bestirred, as it in wonderment, the trees;"
409,MISSING,"The very clouds paused in their breathless race,"
410,MISSING,And shadows played upon his open face;
411,MISSING,And I remember how his laughing eyes
412,MISSING,Shone deep as pools in sea-blue ecstasies.
413,MISSING,The meadow grasses rustled in the heat;
414,MISSING,I even heard the silence of his feet
415,MISSING,Down the slow hill--And now the dawning birth
416,MISSING,Of beauty woke my senses to the earth
417,MISSING,Unveiled in radiance. The sweeping skies--
418,MISSING,Unseen unless reflected in his eyes--
419,MISSING,Marshalled cloud companies with new delight;
420,MISSING,Just for us two the spangled dome of night
421,MISSING,Swung out the journeying moon.
422,MISSING,But still I hold
423,MISSING,Burnt in my memory in beaten gold
424,MISSING,Days when the Spring stirred in each waking bush
425,MISSING,"A blue-flecked jay or tawny-feathered thrush,"
426,MISSING,"And drowsy Winter, startled unawares"
427,MISSING,"By arc-winged partridges or listening hares,"
428,MISSING,Fled guiltily. We heard the magpies call--
429,MISSING,Those dominoes at Nature’s carnival--
430,MISSING,"And once a kingfisher, a lovely gleam"
431,MISSING,"Snatched from a rainbow, darted to a stream."
432,MISSING,The snowdrops bowed their heads for us to see
433,MISSING,Shy peeping buds of hooded chastity;
434,MISSING,And stalwart cowslips raised sun-glinted eyes
435,MISSING,To those who stooped to pluck their sanctities.
436,MISSING,Grass-nestled crocuses that scorn the wind
437,MISSING,Speared upward proudly and besought mankind
438,MISSING,"To step with care. Near by, we searched a glade"
439,MISSING,"Where violets brood in sweetness, half afraid"
440,MISSING,"To wake their petals. On we roamed, and soon"
441,MISSING,The flower that shares her secret with the moon
442,MISSING,"In pale gold fellowship peeped out, among"
443,MISSING,A host of truculent daffodils that flung
444,MISSING,Their trumpets down the wind.
445,MISSING,Each breathless day
446,MISSING,"Broke to fulfil its promise, till the May"
447,MISSING,Had fledged her clustered blooms and swung her pride
448,MISSING,In bowing sweetness to the country side.
449,MISSING,Beauty was born again. But now the sound
450,MISSING,"Of heavy Autumn patters to the ground,"
451,MISSING,And loud discordant booms of thunder roll
452,MISSING,Where that enchanted owner of my soul
453,MISSING,"Lies dead, or dying, or is living still:"
454,MISSING,At last the fibres of my struggling will
455,MISSING,"Falter exhausted, and my cowering brain"
456,MISSING,Cries out in anguish like a child in pain.
457,MISSING,
458,MISSING,"If he is dead, then I abide to prove"
459,MISSING,That brief fulfilment may be perfect love.
460,MISSING,How should I grieve? His life inspired in me
461,MISSING,"A joy that shall outlive eternity,"
462,MISSING,"Wrought out, complete, unsnared by time and age"
463,MISSING,My jewelled past my priceless heritage.
464,MISSING,Shall misery usurp my realm of years
465,MISSING,"And leave me drowning in self-pitying tears,"
466,MISSING,A derelict in my own whirlpool swirled--
467,MISSING,Me--whom Love crowned an empress of the world?
468,MISSING,But sometimes ’ere the light
469,MISSING,"Glimmers dawn-pearled to splash the feet of night,"
470,MISSING,"Ere red, sun-gilded riot floods the sky,"
471,MISSING,"A whisper, swelling to a ringing cry,"
472,MISSING,Tells me he’s living still. No lash could sting
473,MISSING,Like this persistent voice re-echoing
474,MISSING,That mocks me as I stumble to my feet.
475,MISSING,"O, shall I find him wandering in the street?"
476,MISSING,But every beckoning corner drags me past
477,MISSING,"Strangers, new faces, each one like the last"
478,MISSING,"Dull, cold, inscrutable. At times I caught"
479,MISSING,The look--the walk--the gesture that I sought;
480,MISSING,And once with throbbing veins I found those eyes
481,MISSING,"That shone like pools in sea-blue ecstasies,"
482,MISSING,But looked beyond me--cold expressionless
483,MISSING,"In vacant wonder at my helplessness,"
484,MISSING,"Then, haunted by that stare,"
485,MISSING,"Beaten, I knew the bedrock of despair."
486,MISSING,"O, Thou who poised the world, are all my tears"
487,MISSING,"Too light, too pitiful to reach Thine ears?"
488,MISSING,"Locksmith of happiness, aloof, apart,"
489,MISSING,Am I too impotent to touch Thine heart?
490,MISSING,Tell me he’s dead or dying; say he stands
491,MISSING,"Seeking for guidance the warm touch of hands,"
492,MISSING,"Doomed in an instant to eternal night,"
493,MISSING,With only mind and memory for sight--
494,MISSING,For I could cheer him.
495,MISSING,"But Lord quench this drought,"
496,MISSING,"The unfathomable immensity of doubt,"
497,MISSING,"Tell me he’s maimed or crippled, torn or blind,"
498,MISSING,Staring through eyes that show his wandering mind--
499,MISSING,"Tell me he’s rotting in a place abhorred,--"
500,MISSING,"Not this, not this, O Lord!"

543,I,"The wind, which heralded the blackening night,"
544,I,Swirled in grey mists the sulphur-laden smoke.
545,I,"From sleep, in sparkling instancy of light,"
546,I,Crouched batteries like grumbling tigers woke
547,I,And stretched their iron symmetry; they hurled
548,I,Skyward with roar and boom each pregnant shell
549,I,Rumbling on tracks unseen. Such tyrants reign
550,I,"The sullen masters of a mangled world,"
551,I,"Grim-mothered in a womb of furnaced hell,"
552,I,"Wrought, forged, and hammered for the work of pain."
553,I,
554,I,"For six long days the common slayers played,"
555,I,"Till, fitfully, there boomed a heavier king,"
556,I,"Who, couched in leaves and branches deftly laid,"
557,I,"And hid in dappled colour of the spring,"
558,I,"Vaunted tornadoes. Far from that covered lair,"
559,I,Like hidden snares the sinuous trenches lay
560,I,Mid fields where nodding poppies show their pride.
561,I,"The tall star-pointed streamers leap and flare,"
562,I,And turn the night’s immensity to day;

567,II,
568,II,The moment comes when thrice-embittered fire
569,II,Proclaims the prelude to the great attack.
570,II,"In ruined heaps, torn saps and tangled wire"
571,II,And battered parapets loom gaunt and black:
572,II,"The flashes fade, the steady rattle dies,"
573,II,"A breathless hush brings forth a troubled day,"
574,II,"And men of sinew, knit to charge and stand,"
575,II,Rise up. But he of words and blinded eyes
576,II,"Applauds the puppets of his ghastly play,"
577,II,With easy rhetoric and ready hand.
578,II,
579,II,"Unlike those men who waited for the word,"
580,II,Clean soldiers from a country of the sea;
581,II,These were no thong-lashed band or goaded herd
582,II,Tricked by the easy speech of tyranny.
583,II,"All the long week they fought encircling Fate,"
584,II,While chaos clutched the throat and shuddered past
585,II,"As phantoms haunt a child, and softly creep"
586,II,"Round cots, so Death stood sentry at the Gate"
587,II,"And beckoned waiting terror, till at last"
588,II,He vanished at the hurrying touch of sleep.
589,II,
590,II,The beauty of the Earth seemed doubly sweet
591,II,With the stored sacraments the Summer yields--
592,II,"Grass-sunken kine, and softly-hissing wheat,"
593,II,"Blue-misted flax, and drowsy poppy fields."
594,II,But with the vanished day Remembrance came
595,II,"Vivid with dreams, and sweet with magic song,"
596,II,Soft haunting echoes of a distant sea
597,II,As from another world. A belt of flame
598,II,"Held the swift past, and made each moment long"
599,II,With the tense horror of mortality.
600,II,
601,II,That easy lordling of the Universe
602,II,"Who plotted days that stain the path of time,"
603,II,"For him was happy memory a curse,"
604,II,And Man a scapegoat for a royal crime.
605,II,In lagging moments dearly sacrificed
606,II,Men sweated blood before eternity:
607,II,"In cheerful agony, with jest and mirth,"
608,II,They shared the bitter solitude of Christ
609,II,"In a new Garden of Gethsemane,"
610,II,Gethsemane walled in by crested earth.
611,II,
612,II,"They won the greater battle, when each soul"
613,II,Lay naked to the needless wreck of Mars;
614,II,"Yet, splendid in perfection, faced the goal"
615,II,Beyond the sweeping army of the stars.
616,II,Necessity foretold that they must die
617,II,"Mangled and helpless, crippled, maimed and blind,"
618,II,And cursed with all the sacrilege of war--
619,II,"To force a nation to retract a lie,"
620,II,"To prove the unchartered honour of Mankind,"
621,II,To show how strong the silent passions are.

628,III,In steady waves the infantry surge near;
629,III,"The fire, a sweeping curtain, lifts again."
630,III,"A battle-plane with humming engines swerves,"
631,III,"Gleams like a whirring dragon-fly, and dips,"
632,III,Plunging cloud-shadowed in a breathless fall
633,III,To climb undaunted in far-reaching curves.
634,III,"And, swaying in the clouds like anchored ships,"
635,III,Swing grim balloons with eyes that fathom all.
636,III,
637,III,But as the broad-winged battle-planes outsoared
638,III,"The shell-rocked skies, blue fields of cotton flowers,"
639,III,"When bombs like bolts of thunder leapt and roared,"
640,III,"And mighty moments faded into hours,"
641,III,The curtain fire redoubled yet again:
642,III,The grey defence reversed their swift defeat
643,III,"And rallied strongly; whilst the attacking waves,"
644,III,"Snared in a trench and severed from the main,"
645,III,Were driven fighting in a forced retreat
646,III,Across the land that gaped with shell-turned graves.

651,IV,The troubled day sped on in weariness
652,IV,Till Night drugged Carnage in a drunken swoon.
653,IV,"Jet-black, with spangling stars athwart her dress"
654,IV,"And pale in the shafted amber of the moon,"
655,IV,She moved triumphant as a young-eyed queen
656,IV,In silent dignity: her shadowed face
657,IV,"Scarce veiled by gossamer clouds, that scurrying ran"
658,IV,Breathless in speed the high star-lanes between.
659,IV,"She passed unheeding ’neath the dome of space,"
660,IV,And scorned the petty tragedy of Man.
661,IV,
662,IV,"And one looked upward, and in wonder saw"
663,IV,The vast star-soldiered army of the sky.
664,IV,"Unheard, the needless blasphemy of War"
665,IV,Shrank at that primal splendour sweeping by.
666,IV,The moon’s gold-shadowed craters bathed the ground--
667,IV,"(Pale queen, she hunted in her pathless rise"
668,IV,Lithe blackened raiders that bomb-laden creep)
669,IV,"But now the earth-walled comfort wrapped him round,"
670,IV,And soon in lulled forgetfulness he lies
671,IV,Where soldiers clasping arms like children sleep.
672,IV,
673,IV,Sleep held him as a mother holds her child:
674,IV,"Sleep the soft calm that levels hopes and fears,"
675,IV,"Now stilled his brain and scarfed his eyelids wild,"
676,IV,"And sped the transient misery of tears,"
677,IV,Until the dawn’s sure prophets cleft the night
678,IV,"With opal shafts, and streamers tinged with flame,"
679,IV,Swift merging riot of the turbaned East.
680,IV,Through rustling gesture loomed the advancing light;
681,IV,"Through fitful eddying winds, grey vanguards came"
682,IV,Rising in billowy mountains silver-fleeced.
683,IV,
684,IV,"And with the dawn came action, and again"
685,IV,The spiteful interplay of static war:
686,IV,"Dogged, with grim persistence Blood and Pain"
687,IV,Rose venomous to greet the Morning Star.
688,IV,But others watched that lonely sentinel
689,IV,Chase fleeting fellow-stars before the day;
690,IV,Fresh men heard tides of thunder ebb and flow.
691,IV,"--Stumbling in sleep, scarce heeding shot or shell,"
692,IV,The men who fought at Gommecourt filed away:
693,IV,The poppies nodded as they passed below.
694,IV,
695,IV,"They left the barren wilderness behind,"
696,IV,"And Gommecourt gnarled and dauntless, till they came"
697,IV,"To fields where trees unshattered took the wind,"
698,IV,Which tossed the crimson poppy heads to flame.
699,IV,But one stood musing at a waking thought
700,IV,That spurred his blood and dimmed his searching eyes--
701,IV,The primal thought that stirs the seed to birth.
702,IV,Here where the battling nations clashed and fought
703,IV,The common grass still breathed of Paradise
704,IV,And Love with silent lips was Lord of Earth.

824,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,
825,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,For now the magic carnivals begin
826,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,"The lilac broods in honeyed secrecy,"
827,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,And dappled lawns are changed: a Harlequin
828,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,Has brushed the tangled carpet silently.
829,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,We know how white narcissus fills the lake
830,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,With dancing shadows; how in open blue
831,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,"A chestnut builds her clustered pyramids,"
832,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,And down below anemones awake;
833,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,Long-hushed the violets open wide their lids
834,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,And all the dreamed-of fantasy comes true.
835,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,
836,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,Glad tidings thrill the re-awakened earth
837,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,By daffodils and blue-bells heralded;
838,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,Spring with her van imperial comes forth
839,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,To herald Summer proudly canopied
840,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,Beneath the bowing leaves. Persistent Spring
841,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,Bestirs the seed enshrined in Winter’s store;
842,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,And even round the parapet a breath
843,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,Of far-flung prophecy is clamouring:
844,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,“Behold new life within the tomb of death
845,SPRING IN THE TRENCHES,“Importunate and vivid as before.”

850,ON THE ROAD,ON THE ROAD
851,ON THE ROAD,
852,ON THE ROAD,
853,ON THE ROAD,"We halted, with the urgent Spring behind"
854,ON THE ROAD,"Our straining teams, where all the land was black,"
855,ON THE ROAD,"And huddled woods lay beaten, starkly blind:"
856,ON THE ROAD,Their mangled branches loomed athwart the track
857,ON THE ROAD,"Grotesque and terrible. Yet near the way,"
858,ON THE ROAD,"A river, scatheless as the open sea,"
859,ON THE ROAD,Flowed like a breathing hope that cannot die
860,ON THE ROAD,"In desolation. Now, at setting day,"
861,ON THE ROAD,"Moored water lilies, pale as argent sky,"
862,ON THE ROAD,Cling to the twilight fading silently.
863,ON THE ROAD,
864,ON THE ROAD,"Such is the tale of memory, ere night"
865,ON THE ROAD,"Had deepened, and our weary convoy slept"
866,ON THE ROAD,Beside the way. Slow-rising points of light
867,ON THE ROAD,Twinkled amid the spangled netting swept
868,ON THE ROAD,Across the ebon desert; and a gleam
869,ON THE ROAD,Pierced the cloud-woven pillows of the moon.
870,ON THE ROAD,Now slumber freed me from the iron cage
871,ON THE ROAD,"That bound the snarling war; and, in a dream,"
872,ON THE ROAD,The panorama of a dawning age
873,ON THE ROAD,"Unrolled, a world slow-waking from a swoon."
874,ON THE ROAD,
875,ON THE ROAD,Before my gaze a teeming city loomed
876,ON THE ROAD,Gay with the bustling clamour of the street--
877,ON THE ROAD,The very town an easy word had doomed
878,ON THE ROAD,And cast in ashes at the trampling feet
879,ON THE ROAD,"Of mortal gods. Street, corner, square and place,"
880,ON THE ROAD,Seemed woken from a long and squalid trance--
881,ON THE ROAD,I saw a nation growing like a flower;
882,ON THE ROAD,A nation true and loyal to a race
883,ON THE ROAD,That forged an army of clean-soldiered power
884,ON THE ROAD,Wrought by the common chivalry of France.
885,ON THE ROAD,
886,ON THE ROAD,"Here was no arrogance of martial pride,"
887,ON THE ROAD,"The fireside boast that sows the fatal seed,"
888,ON THE ROAD,For happiness had come from those who died
889,ON THE ROAD,Stark of delusion and the deadly creed
890,ON THE ROAD,Of false romance. I saw a world reborn--
891,ON THE ROAD,The very battlefield was robed again
892,ON THE ROAD,"In lines of chequered land, and bordered round"
893,ON THE ROAD,With stretching roads and rills. The poppied corn
894,ON THE ROAD,"Held rubies set in gold, and far beyond"
895,ON THE ROAD,Lay a surf-ravelled sea and swarded plain.
896,ON THE ROAD,
897,ON THE ROAD,"I marvelled, till oblivion shadowed all,"
898,ON THE ROAD,Blurred in the dawning light of every day.
899,ON THE ROAD,"It was so true, I scarcely heard the call"
900,ON THE ROAD,To feed and water and to move away.
901,ON THE ROAD,"We stretched our limbs, and packed each heavy load;"
902,ON THE ROAD,"Moved on, and left the weary night behind,"
903,ON THE ROAD,Through torn and withered trees that stared aghast;
904,ON THE ROAD,"Yet, through the veil that shrouded all the road"
905,ON THE ROAD,"I saw new radiance in the land we passed,"
906,ON THE ROAD,And heard a sudden murmur in the wind.

980,THE SOMME,In murdered Picardy.
981,THE SOMME,
982,THE SOMME,My eddies bear the clinging scent of lime
983,THE SOMME,To sweeten clouds of plume-tossed meadowsweet;
984,THE SOMME,My meadow grasses nestle with the thyme
985,THE SOMME,And flowering rushes tower in the heat.
986,THE SOMME,Low-brushing swifts and swallows splashed with white
987,THE SOMME,O’er flash my laden mirrors slow and deep
988,THE SOMME,That bear swift-merging canopies of sleep.
989,THE SOMME,Until the growing light
990,THE SOMME,"Has chased marauding owls, and butterflies,"
991,THE SOMME,"Born of blue-woven skies,"

993,THE SOMME,But who are these? The powdered butterfly
994,THE SOMME,Outshines that air leviathan that swings
995,THE SOMME,"In rigid curves adown the barren sky,"
996,THE SOMME,With cloudy satellites about her wings.
997,THE SOMME,And I have seen
998,THE SOMME,Dark horsemen ride with spears of tapered steel;
999,THE SOMME,And bellowing guns beneath the far balloons.
1000,THE SOMME,And once a ponderous slug bedecked in green
1001,THE SOMME,"Crept, in the waning moon’s"
1002,THE SOMME,"Still-darkening gloom, and at her giant heel"
1003,THE SOMME,"White-gleaming, ran a train of hooded cars...."
1004,THE SOMME,

1006,THE SOMME,Amid the snarling impotence of wars.
1007,THE SOMME,"Turn where you will. Look, there a signboard shows"
1008,THE SOMME,The lair of guns; already round the sign
1009,THE SOMME,White trumpeting convolvuli entwine
1010,THE SOMME,"Their clinging arms, across the placard blows"
1011,THE SOMME,A quiet-breathing rose.
1012,THE SOMME,And still my lily-breasted waters shine
1013,THE SOMME,And loud my chanting grows:
1014,THE SOMME,
1015,THE SOMME,From peace through war my waters flow

1291,THE SHADOW,
1292,THE SHADOW,I stood one night where rivers pause to meet
1293,THE SHADOW,And mingle in the traffic-rumbling sea:
1294,THE SHADOW,"The surge and clamour of a London street,"
1295,THE SHADOW,"In tides alternate, rolled, impassively."
1296,THE SHADOW,Before my feet
1297,THE SHADOW,"Ran shouting boys, and through the pallid glare"
1298,THE SHADOW,Loomed gaunt leviathans that swayed and roared
1299,THE SHADOW,"Past glittering shops, and stations which outpoured"
1300,THE SHADOW,Load after weary load; and everywhere
1301,THE SHADOW,"Strange sounds, a snatch of laughter, shout or word,"
1302,THE SHADOW,Sleek-coated motor-cars that softly purred
1303,THE SHADOW,Round corners sounding with the rustling beat
1304,THE SHADOW,Of hurried swarms of feet.
1305,THE SHADOW,"And yet I seemed alone, and dumb-amazed"
1306,THE SHADOW,"Before a towering building, wherein blazed"
1307,THE SHADOW,"One staring patch of light, one amber square"
1308,THE SHADOW,That shone enshrouded by the dome of night
1309,THE SHADOW,High in the naked air. And still I gazed
1310,THE SHADOW,Until a shadow passed across the blind:
1311,THE SHADOW,A shadow-woman pacing time away
1312,THE SHADOW,"Beside a bed, wherein a poet lay"
1313,THE SHADOW,"Dying, dying. One whose mind"
1314,THE SHADOW,(A womb of beauty whereof love was lord)
1315,THE SHADOW,Had fashioned symphonies of thought and word
1316,THE SHADOW,Impassionately sweet. And suddenly
1317,THE SHADOW,She paused--I saw the shadow of her hand
1318,THE SHADOW,Stretch out and shudder back. I saw her stand
1319,THE SHADOW,All sorrow-bound in graven dignity.
1320,THE SHADOW,"She bowed her head, her shoulders taut with pain,"
1321,THE SHADOW,Her figure burdened with the weight of tears.
1322,THE SHADOW,Then all grew dark. And in my waking ears
1323,THE SHADOW,The traffic surged again.

1334,EVERYCHILD,"Alive with humming-birds and bees,"
1335,EVERYCHILD,Where shiny seals and porpoises
1336,EVERYCHILD,Snort in the rolling blue.

1339,EVERYCHILD,"We shear the arctic foam,"

1341,EVERYCHILD,"Roar loudly through the dancing night,"
1342,EVERYCHILD,And drive the killer-whales to flight--
1343,EVERYCHILD,Upon the floor at home.
1344,EVERYCHILD,
1345,EVERYCHILD,O hear the chant of Eastern song
1346,EVERYCHILD,"Beneath Arabian stars,"
1347,EVERYCHILD,Where camels slowly stalk along
1348,EVERYCHILD,"And gleaming Arabs, tall and strong,"
1349,EVERYCHILD,Buy gold and merchandise among
1350,EVERYCHILD,The riot of bazaars!
1351,EVERYCHILD,
1352,EVERYCHILD,The glow-worms crawl excitedly
1353,EVERYCHILD,And trim their lamps o’ night;
1354,EVERYCHILD,"For often, ere the moon is high,"
1355,EVERYCHILD,Bat-harnessed walnut-shells flit by
1356,EVERYCHILD,To bear them to the waiting sky
1357,EVERYCHILD,And set the stars alight.
1358,EVERYCHILD,
1359,EVERYCHILD,The nodding poplars understand
1360,EVERYCHILD,And birds and beasts and flowers:
1361,EVERYCHILD,And we shall wander hand in hand
1362,EVERYCHILD,With better things than Peter Panned--
1363,EVERYCHILD,O what is footlight fairyland
1364,EVERYCHILD,Beside this world of ours?
1365,EVERYCHILD,
1366,EVERYCHILD,What matter if the clouds are grey
1367,EVERYCHILD,"Or winter-keen and wild,"
1368,EVERYCHILD,When you and I have found a way
1369,EVERYCHILD,To turn November into May;
1370,EVERYCHILD,For Everyjoy is Everyday
1371,EVERYCHILD,And Everyman a child.

1415,I,How rhythm halts and rhyme rings falsely true.
1416,I,"Yet courage, your disciple, bids me show"
1417,I,That speech may offer sacrifice to you.
1418,I,Vain boast! For if success in splendour came
1419,I,"Poised faultlessly in lines of perfect stress,"
1420,I,I must fall short of it in very shame
1421,I,Unworthy of my sonnet’s worthiness.
1422,I,
1423,I,"But should I fail, and feel the words I sought"
1424,I,"Elusive, or bedecked with frail disguise"
1425,I,"Of tattered sentiment, that risk I dare"
1426,I,"Not hazard in the winding maze of thought,"

1434,II,"And worldly whisper, who so poor as they?"
1435,II,For everywhere alike the common way
1436,II,Has now become an earthly paradise.
1437,II,And where you walk the very pavement cries
1438,II,"Of blue-bells, April-chimed, and fawns at play;"
1439,II,And London seems a sylvan holiday
1440,II,Of flower-hunting bees and butterflies.
1441,II,
1442,II,"So let me fail, for where I could succeed"
1443,II,"How mean the quest, a climber gazing down"
1444,II,From the low vantage of some petty hill.
1445,II,But chance success would be the gambler’s thrill

1456,III,"For joy is mine, and mine the teeming years"
1457,III,Unfettered in a world impassionate;
1458,III,Not mine a sorrowed Calvary of tears
1459,III,Where love was vassal to the lords of hate.

1474,IV,And aped the clownish mummers of the street;
1475,IV,"Till suddenly the world grew strangely sweet,"
1476,IV,"All eager at a touch, and thrilling-keen;"
1477,IV,With half-forgotten hands I strove unseen
1478,IV,To mould a little planet at your feet.

1494,V,If I had seen beyond the looming years
1495,V,"Your shadow, grief had haunted me in vain,"
1496,V,For what are cataracts of human tears
1497,V,Beside the boundless laughter of the main?
1498,V,

1500,V,"Wakes clamorous with dawning life conceived,"
1501,V,So has the magic universe revealed

1513,VI,"So, did you learn the droning lore of bees"
1514,VI,From some be-medalled soldier? Did you meet

1516,VI,"Or bishops, babbling of the opal seas?"
1517,VI,
1518,VI,"O poor deceiver, conscript joys belong"

1520,VI,"Bear fruit to-day, and blossom like the flowers"

1532,VII,"O happiness, to know joy’s secret mine,"
1533,VII,"To hold adoring ministers in fee,"
1534,VII,Narcissus-like to bless the Serpentine
1535,VII,And with the stars outdance Terpsichore.
1536,VII,
1537,VII,"For once a poet sang of happiness,"
1538,VII,"But now, like running flame, glad voices say--"
1539,VII,“Joy is the sheer antithesis of wrong.”

1550,VIII,Forget the sacrament and go away?
1551,VIII,"Shall I adore, like sorrowed men to-day,"
1552,VIII,The child who gurgled in first ecstasies
1553,VIII,At oxen (Mary said) that mooed surprise
1554,VIII,And snuffed with wondering muzzles in the hay?
1555,VIII,
1556,VIII,O leave the past--the living world is mine
1557,VIII,"Warm, passionate, and breathing. Even so"
1558,VIII,Shall Life in after years make Earth divine

1682,MAY-JUNE,"And purple lilac, trembles overhead;"
1683,MAY-JUNE,And bees a-drone in field and flower bed
1684,MAY-JUNE,Make clamorous the trade of teeming hours.
1685,MAY-JUNE,
1686,MAY-JUNE,"Now the sweet-pea, all honey-laden, shows"
1687,MAY-JUNE,"Full-swollen sails, her mooring ropes of green"
1688,MAY-JUNE,Encircle twigs. And soon the primrose queen
1689,MAY-JUNE,Lights her pale lamps of Evening ’mid the glows
1690,MAY-JUNE,"Of brazen flower-suns, that burn between"
1691,MAY-JUNE,The yawning honeysuckle and the rose.
1692,MAY-JUNE,

1696,THE STROLLING SINGER,THE STROLLING SINGER
1697,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1698,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1699,THE STROLLING SINGER,Sun-bathed in Summer peace the village lay
1700,THE STROLLING SINGER,That afternoon. Along the happy street
1701,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Milk-fragrant kine, and wagons high with hay"
1702,THE STROLLING SINGER,Came lumbering. The fields were loud with bees
1703,THE STROLLING SINGER,And drowsy with the wind-stirred meadowsweet.
1704,THE STROLLING SINGER,From bowing trees
1705,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Fell chatter, and above the garden wall"
1706,THE STROLLING SINGER,Wide sunflowers beamed at spearing hollyhocks
1707,THE STROLLING SINGER,"That dared the wind, and scorned the clustered stocks,"
1708,THE STROLLING SINGER,And bore their laddered blooms high over all.
1709,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1710,THE STROLLING SINGER,Here amid Summer murmur and delight
1711,THE STROLLING SINGER,The strolling singer came. The people heard
1712,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Stray snatches of a song--a laugh--a word,"
1713,THE STROLLING SINGER,And gossiping in groups of two or three
1714,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Stood all amazed. For no one came in sight,"
1715,THE STROLLING SINGER,Only the wind was laden drowsily
1716,THE STROLLING SINGER,With mellow sounds that slowly growing strong
1717,THE STROLLING SINGER,At last became a song:--
1718,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1719,THE STROLLING SINGER,"“Bend down, the marsh and meadow holds"
1720,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Pale yellow pimpernels,"
1721,THE STROLLING SINGER,"And sun-begotten marigolds,"
1722,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Thyme, orchis, asphodels,"
1723,THE STROLLING SINGER,"And borage born of ocean blue,"
1724,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Plumed armoured thistles, fever-few,"
1725,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Sea-campion globed, and clinging dew"
1726,THE STROLLING SINGER,In giant flower-bells.
1727,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1728,THE STROLLING SINGER,"“Bend down--an ebon beetle prowls,"
1729,THE STROLLING SINGER,And there a swinging bee
1730,THE STROLLING SINGER,Drinks honey from the laden cowls
1731,THE STROLLING SINGER,That clothe the foxglove tree.
1732,THE STROLLING SINGER,And giant peacock butterflies
1733,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Light meadowsweet with sudden eyes,"
1734,THE STROLLING SINGER,And through the tangled grasses rise
1735,THE STROLLING SINGER,Lucerne and timothy.”
1736,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1737,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Louder and louder grew the voice, until"
1738,THE STROLLING SINGER,"A figure specked the heaven-touching hill,"
1739,THE STROLLING SINGER,"And nearer, nearer, still ..."
1740,THE STROLLING SINGER,The villagers in mingled fear and awe
1741,THE STROLLING SINGER,Stood round on tiptoe waiting. Soon they saw
1742,THE STROLLING SINGER,A little sylvan man with beckoning eyes
1743,THE STROLLING SINGER,And limbs of lithe expression. Woven flowers
1744,THE STROLLING SINGER,"And grasses, splashed with rainbow-tinted showers,"
1745,THE STROLLING SINGER,"And jewelled with alluring butterflies,"
1746,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Enwrapped him. Russet face, clear-featured, gay"
1747,THE STROLLING SINGER,"As pebble-rumpled streams, and tousled hair"
1748,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Sun-dyed and naked. His limbs were bronzed and bare,"
1749,THE STROLLING SINGER,"And sprang, it seemed, from the wild interplay"
1750,THE STROLLING SINGER,Of flower-woven garb. Around his waist
1751,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Twined traveller’s-joy and honeysuckle, sweet"
1752,THE STROLLING SINGER,"And freshly dewed, and on his lissom feet"
1753,THE STROLLING SINGER,Were pointed shoes of silver beech rush-laced.
1754,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1755,THE STROLLING SINGER,"The village gazed in silence, till a child"
1756,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Began:--“Who are you, funny man?"
1757,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Your face seems to be telling truth, your eyes"
1758,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Are just the colour of blue butterflies,"
1759,THE STROLLING SINGER,O tell us who you are?”
1760,THE STROLLING SINGER,"The stranger smiled,"
1761,THE STROLLING SINGER,"And turned his face that bore the wistful, far,"
1762,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Strange wonder-look of one whose dreams come true,"
1763,THE STROLLING SINGER,Who delves in darkened quarries of his brain
1764,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Unhoped-for gold, and changes old to new"
1765,THE STROLLING SINGER,As Spring rejuvenates the earth again.
1766,THE STROLLING SINGER,Of one who plays Narcissus in Life’s pool
1767,THE STROLLING SINGER,And sees an image strangely beautiful ...
1768,THE STROLLING SINGER,Then suddenly they heard him cry:--
1769,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1770,THE STROLLING SINGER,"“Come buy,"
1771,THE STROLLING SINGER,I own the laughing earth.
1772,THE STROLLING SINGER,And all my chanted words are deeds;
1773,THE STROLLING SINGER,"I follow where my fancy leads,"
1774,THE STROLLING SINGER,And sell my songs for mirth.
1775,THE STROLLING SINGER,What will you buy?
1776,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1777,THE STROLLING SINGER,"“Speak hurriedly, and choose your song,"
1778,THE STROLLING SINGER,"The poplar’s shadow creeps along,"
1779,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Search hurriedly the Earth and Sky,"
1780,THE STROLLING SINGER,What will you buy?”
1781,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1782,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Meanwhile a crowd had gathered, in a ring;"
1783,THE STROLLING SINGER,"The butcher, grocer, postman, parson, clerk,"
1784,THE STROLLING SINGER,"And all the village, open-mouthed and stark,"
1785,THE STROLLING SINGER,Stood mutely marvelling;
1786,THE STROLLING SINGER,And children clamoured round him with large eyes
1787,THE STROLLING SINGER,"And pelted him for songs, like countless hail,"
1788,THE STROLLING SINGER,"With pleadings, shouts and cries:--"
1789,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1790,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Sing us a song of Paradise,"
1791,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Of railway engines, fawns,"
1792,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Of stolen queens in guarded towers,"
1793,THE STROLLING SINGER,Of sprites and leprechauns”--
1794,THE STROLLING SINGER,O HUSH! All were dumb--
1795,THE STROLLING SINGER,"“Boy in blue smock, sucking your thumb,"
1796,THE STROLLING SINGER,"With hair like a tangled chrysanthemum,"
1797,THE STROLLING SINGER,"What would you like me to sing, Ocean-eyed?”"
1798,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1799,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Loud the boy’s answer rang,"
1800,THE STROLLING SINGER,“_I_ want a song of flowers!”
1801,THE STROLLING SINGER,And this is the song he sang:
1802,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1803,THE STROLLING SINGER,"“Sisters of mercy are Cyclamen,"
1804,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Snowdrops and Arums too,"
1805,THE STROLLING SINGER,"But Primulus, Violets, Stocks, Mignonette,"
1806,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Crocus aflame, and the Never Forget,"
1807,THE STROLLING SINGER,Are chaster than chastity too.
1808,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Now sulphur Laburnum and Lilac, adieu,"
1809,THE STROLLING SINGER,Good-bye April children to you!
1810,THE STROLLING SINGER,For who
1811,THE STROLLING SINGER,Will climb up the flowers of my Hollyhock towers
1812,THE STROLLING SINGER,With butterfly steeple-jacks blue?
1813,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1814,THE STROLLING SINGER,"But, climber, beware!"
1815,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Of Love-in-a-mist in a tangle of hair,"
1816,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Of thistly Teazles, and winged Sweet-Peas"
1817,THE STROLLING SINGER,"With tentacle tendrils that strangle with ease,"
1818,THE STROLLING SINGER,Of butterfly Orchis a-clamour for bees.
1819,THE STROLLING SINGER,"For Dragon may Snap you, and Sundew may trap you,"
1820,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Before you have started, before you have parted"
1821,THE STROLLING SINGER,The grass at the foot of my Hollyhock trees.
1822,THE STROLLING SINGER,But think of the view
1823,THE STROLLING SINGER,Of the whole garden side!
1824,THE STROLLING SINGER,"We’ll charter a dragon-fly homeward, and ride"
1825,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Down to our Rosemary, Marjoram, Rue,"
1826,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Lavender, London Pride.”"
1827,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1828,THE STROLLING SINGER,"All watched him, held, bewitched, and with him clung"
1829,THE STROLLING SINGER,"To the green tops of slowly swaying towers,"
1830,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Where bees had scattered pollen-dust, that hung"
1831,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Above the teeming nectaries of flowers,"
1832,THE STROLLING SINGER,And all again were young.
1833,THE STROLLING SINGER,But now the poplars cast their phantom bars
1834,THE STROLLING SINGER,"In latticed shadows; now a scarf unfurled,"
1835,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Like parrot-tulip petals hued and torn,"
1836,THE STROLLING SINGER,Across the West was flung.
1837,THE STROLLING SINGER,"And now, before the twilight bares the stars,"
1838,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Ere jewelled night is born,"
1839,THE STROLLING SINGER,All silently the Singer left the world.
1840,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Beyond the hill he passed,"
1841,THE STROLLING SINGER,But singing all the while; first loud and strong.
1842,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Then fainter, till at last"
1843,THE STROLLING SINGER,Came only jumbled echoes of a song:--
1844,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1845,THE STROLLING SINGER,“Bend down--the marsh and meadow holds
1846,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Pale yellow Pimpernels,"
1847,THE STROLLING SINGER,And sun-begotten Marigolds
1848,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Thyme, Orchis, Asphodels” ..."
1849,THE STROLLING SINGER,(Fainter and fainter it grew
1850,THE STROLLING SINGER,Gentle as ebbing tide)
1851,THE STROLLING SINGER,“Butterfly steeple-jacks blue” ...
1852,THE STROLLING SINGER,(Fainter it grew
1853,THE STROLLING SINGER,And died)
1854,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Echoing “Rosemary, Marjoram, Rue,"
1855,THE STROLLING SINGER,"Lavender, London Pride”"
1856,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1857,THE STROLLING SINGER,
1858,THE STROLLING SINGER,

1865,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,"Grow, grow in peace. Around, the pangs of war"

1874,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,"Stir, little hand"
1875,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,Unrealized--I count the dragging hours
1876,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,And yearn to see it clutch at yonder flowers;
1877,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,To see thy lucent feet and dimpled frame
1878,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,"And gaze at heav’n-snatched eyes and know thy name,"
1879,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,But stay awhile.
1880,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,For thou art best alone away from Man:
1881,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,"Wait longer, tears unshed and lurking smile"
1882,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,Of joy enshrined where every joy began.
1883,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,Time hurries as the moments thump along
1884,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,"(Hark, little ears, my heart is beating strong)"
1885,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,"Life is aglow, alive, a perfect song."
1886,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,"Around the land is ugly, but apart"
1887,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,"I fashion thee in thought. Now hush, for sleep"
1888,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,"Is here. Close, eyes unopened, voice unheard,"
1889,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,Be still. Grow on in beauty till day creep ...
1890,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,Hark to my whispered word--
1891,THE FRENCH MOTHER TO HER UNBORN CHILD,"Beat quietly, hid heart."
