43,_TO D. V. B._,"They watch us leaving harbour for the greatest game of all,"
44,_TO D. V. B._,And wonder if we're coming back across the greedy sea;
45,_TO D. V. B._,They never know the fighting thrill or high adventure's call--
46,_TO D. V. B._,I rather think the women folk are better men than we.
47,_TO D. V. B._,"But I suspect they say of us as out to sea we go,"
48,_TO D. V. B._,In all our panoply of pride from Orkney to the Nore:
49,_TO D. V. B._,"""It keeps them quiet, we suppose--they like the work, we know--"
50,_TO D. V. B._,"And soon perhaps they'll tire and play some safer game than War."""
