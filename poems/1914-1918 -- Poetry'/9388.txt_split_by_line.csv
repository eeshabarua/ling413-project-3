97,THE RED FLOWER,
98,THE RED FLOWER,"In the pleasant time of Pentecost,"
99,THE RED FLOWER,"By the little river Kyll,"
100,THE RED FLOWER,I followed the angler's winding path
101,THE RED FLOWER,Or waded the stream at will.
102,THE RED FLOWER,And the friendly fertile German land
103,THE RED FLOWER,Lay round me green and still.
104,THE RED FLOWER,
105,THE RED FLOWER,But all day long on the eastern bank
106,THE RED FLOWER,"Of the river cool and clear,"
107,THE RED FLOWER,Where the curving track of the double rails
108,THE RED FLOWER,"Was hardly seen though near,"
109,THE RED FLOWER,The endless trains of German troops
110,THE RED FLOWER,Went rolling down to Trier.
111,THE RED FLOWER,
112,THE RED FLOWER,They packed the windows with bullet heads
113,THE RED FLOWER,And caps of hodden gray;
114,THE RED FLOWER,They laughed and sang and shouted loud
115,THE RED FLOWER,When the trains were brought to a stay;
116,THE RED FLOWER,They waved their hands and sang again
117,THE RED FLOWER,As they went on their iron way.
118,THE RED FLOWER,
119,THE RED FLOWER,"No shadow fell on the smiling land,"
120,THE RED FLOWER,No cloud arose in the sky;
121,THE RED FLOWER,I could hear the river's quiet tune
122,THE RED FLOWER,When the trains had rattled by;
123,THE RED FLOWER,But my heart sank low with a heavy sense
124,THE RED FLOWER,"Of trouble,--I knew not why."
125,THE RED FLOWER,
126,THE RED FLOWER,Then came I into a certain field
127,THE RED FLOWER,Where the devil's paint-brush spread
128,THE RED FLOWER,'Mid the gray and green of the rolling hills
129,THE RED FLOWER,"A flaring splotch of red,"
130,THE RED FLOWER,"An evil omen, a bloody sign,"
131,THE RED FLOWER,And a token of many dead.
132,THE RED FLOWER,
133,THE RED FLOWER,I saw in a vision the field-gray horde
134,THE RED FLOWER,"Break forth at the devil's hour,"
135,THE RED FLOWER,And trample the earth into crimson mud
136,THE RED FLOWER,"In the rage of the Will to Power,--"
137,THE RED FLOWER,"All this I dreamed in the valley of Kyll,"
138,THE RED FLOWER,At the sign of the blood-red flower.

148,A SCRAP OF PAPER,

751,THE PROUD LADY,
752,THE PROUD LADY,But the grains of corn went drifting down
753,THE PROUD LADY,"Like devil-scattered seed,"

761,THE PROUD LADY,
762,THE PROUD LADY,"Then Stävoren town saw evil years,"
763,THE PROUD LADY,No ships could out or in.
764,THE PROUD LADY,"The boats lay rolling at the piers,"
765,THE PROUD LADY,And the mouldy grain in the bin.
766,THE PROUD LADY,
767,THE PROUD LADY,"The grass-grown streets were all forlorn,"
768,THE PROUD LADY,"The town in ruin stood,"
769,THE PROUD LADY,"The lady's velvet gown was torn,"
770,THE PROUD LADY,Her rings were sold for food.
771,THE PROUD LADY,
772,THE PROUD LADY,"Her father had perished long ago,"
