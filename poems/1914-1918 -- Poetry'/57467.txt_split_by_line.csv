156,PICCADILLY,"Thus carolled FRED LOCKER, just sixty years back,"
157,PICCADILLY,"In a year (’57) when the outlook was black,"
158,PICCADILLY,And even to-day the war-weariest Willie
159,PICCADILLY,Recovers his spirits in dear Piccadilly.
160,PICCADILLY,
161,PICCADILLY,"We haven’t the belles with their Gainsborough hats,"
162,PICCADILLY,"Or the Regency bucks with their wondrous cravats,"
163,PICCADILLY,But now that the weather no longer is chilly
164,PICCADILLY,There’s much to enchant us in New Piccadilly.
165,PICCADILLY,
166,PICCADILLY,"As I sit in my club and partake of my “ration,”"
167,PICCADILLY,No longer I’m vexed by the follies of fashion;
168,PICCADILLY,The dandified Johnnies so precious and silly—
169,PICCADILLY,You seek them in vain in the New Piccadilly.
170,PICCADILLY,
171,PICCADILLY,"The men are alert and upstanding and fit,"
172,PICCADILLY,They’ve most of them done or they’re doing their bit;
173,PICCADILLY,With the eye of a hawk and the stride of a gillie
174,PICCADILLY,They add a new lustre to Old Piccadilly.
175,PICCADILLY,
176,PICCADILLY,And the crippled but gay-hearted heroes in blue
177,PICCADILLY,"Are a far finer product than wicked “old Q,”"
178,PICCADILLY,Who ought to have lived in a prison on skilly
179,PICCADILLY,Instead of a palace in mid Piccadilly.
180,PICCADILLY,
181,PICCADILLY,"The women are splendid, so quiet and strong,"
182,PICCADILLY,As with resolute purpose they hurry along—
183,PICCADILLY,"Excepting the flappers, who chatter as shrilly"
184,PICCADILLY,As parrots let loose to distract Piccadilly.
185,PICCADILLY,
186,PICCADILLY,Thus I muse as I watch with a reverent eye
187,PICCADILLY,"The New Generation sweep steadily by,"
188,PICCADILLY,And judge him an ass or a born Silly Billy
189,PICCADILLY,Who’d barter the New for the Old Piccadilly.

196,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,(_After reading “Irish Memories.”_)
197,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,
198,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,
199,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Two Irish cousins greet us here
200,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"From BUSHE “the silver-tongued” descended,"
201,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Whose lives for close on thirty year
202,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Were indistinguishably blended;
203,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"Scorning the rule that holds for cooks,"
204,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"They pooled their brains and joined their forces,"
205,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,And wrote a dozen gorgeous books
206,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"On men and women, hounds and horses."
207,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,
208,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,They superseded _Handley Cross_;
209,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,They glorified the “hunting fever”;
210,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"They purged their pages of the dross,"
211,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"While bettering the fun, of LEVER;"
212,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,With many a priceless turn of phrase
213,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"They stirred us to Homeric laughter,"
214,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,When painting Ireland in the days
215,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Before Sinn Fein bewitched and “strafed” her.
216,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,
217,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,With them we watched good _Major Yeates_
218,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"Contending with litigious peasants,"
219,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"With “hidden hands” within his gates,"
220,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,With claims for foxes and for pheasants;
221,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,We saw _Leigh Kelway_ drop his chin—
222,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,That precious English super-tripper—
223,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,In shocked amazement drinking in
224,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,The lurid narrative of _Slipper_.
225,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,
226,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"_Philippa’s_ piercing peacock squeals,"
227,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Uttered in moments of expansion;
228,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,The grime and splendour of the meals
229,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Of _Mrs. Knox_ and of her mansion;
230,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"The secrets of horse-coping lore,"
231,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,The loves of _Sally_ and of _Flurry_—
232,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,All these delights and hundreds more
233,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Are not forgotten in a hurry.
234,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,
235,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Yet the same genial pens that freight
236,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Our memories with joyous magic
237,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Gave us the tale of _Francie’s_ fate—
238,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"So vulgar, lovable and tragic;"
239,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Just to the land that gave them birth
240,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"They showed her smiling, sad and sullen,"
241,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,And turning from the paths of mirth
242,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Probed the dark soul of _Charlotte Mullen_.
243,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,
244,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"Alas! the tie, so close, so dear,"
245,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Two years ago death rent asunder;
246,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Hushed is the voice so gay and clear
247,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Which moved us once to joy and wonder;
248,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"Yet, though they chronicle a loss"
249,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"Whose pang no lapse of time assuages,"
250,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,The spirit of brave “MARTIN ROSS”
251,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Shines like a star throughout these pages.
252,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,
253,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Here in her letters may one trace
254,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"The generous scorn, the gentle pity,"
255,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"The easy unaffected grace,"
256,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,The wisdom that was always witty;
257,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"Here, mirrored in a sister soul,"
258,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,"One sees the comrade, strong yet tender,"
259,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Who marched unfaltering to her goal
260,TO “MARTIN ROSS”,Through sacrifice and self-surrender.

285,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,Of one whom we elders adored—

287,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,Of ARTEMUS WARD.
288,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,
289,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,"With you, O enchanting Canadian,"
290,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,We laughed till you gave us a stitch
291,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,In our sides at the wondrous Arcadian
292,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,Exploits of the indolent rich;
293,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,"We loved your satirical sniping,"
294,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,"And followed, far over “the pond,”"
295,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,The lure of your whimsical piping
296,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,Behind the Beyond.

298,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,In place of the squalor that stretches
299,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,"Unchanged o’er the realist’s page,"
300,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,The sunshine that glows in your Sketches
301,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,Is potent our griefs to assuage;
302,TO STEPHEN LEACOCK,"And when, on your mettlesome charger,"

332,TO “BARTIMEUS”,
333,TO “BARTIMEUS”,Although the movements of the sea
334,TO “BARTIMEUS”,Have always been a grief to me
335,TO “BARTIMEUS”,And still at times disastrously
336,TO “BARTIMEUS”,"Affect my _corpus vile_,"
337,TO “BARTIMEUS”,Sailors of high and low degree
338,TO “BARTIMEUS”,I long have honoured highly.
339,TO “BARTIMEUS”,

343,TO “BARTIMEUS”,To guard and shield and free us;

373,TO “BARTIMEUS”,That’s mean or low or squalid.
374,TO “BARTIMEUS”,
375,TO “BARTIMEUS”,And then you write of wondrous things
376,TO “BARTIMEUS”,That pluck our hearts’ most secret strings—

378,TO “BARTIMEUS”,On scenes of stern endeavour;

380,TO “BARTIMEUS”,Or chills the heart for ever.

382,TO “BARTIMEUS”,"So when young writers, void of ruth,"

641,THE HOUSE-MASTER,For he was brusque in various ways
642,THE HOUSE-MASTER,"That jarred upon the modern mother,"
643,THE HOUSE-MASTER,And scouted as a silly craze
644,THE HOUSE-MASTER,The theory of the “elder brother.”
645,THE HOUSE-MASTER,
646,THE HOUSE-MASTER,Renowned at Cambridge as an oar
647,THE HOUSE-MASTER,"And quite distinguished as a wrangler,"

677,THE HOUSE-MASTER,"So when pneumonia, doubly dread,"
678,THE HOUSE-MASTER,"Of breath had nearly quite bereft me,"
679,THE HOUSE-MASTER,He watched three nights beside my bed
680,THE HOUSE-MASTER,Until the burning fever left me.
681,THE HOUSE-MASTER,

688,THE HOUSE-MASTER,Saw the true spirit of the race

690,THE HOUSE-MASTER,
691,THE HOUSE-MASTER,The War’s deep waters o’er him rolled

695,THE HOUSE-MASTER,And yet he never heaved a sigh

779,CONSTABLE JINKS,
780,CONSTABLE JINKS,Fame sealed his renown with a definite stamp
781,CONSTABLE JINKS,When two German waiters escaped from a camp.

785,CONSTABLE JINKS,When a derelict porpoise was cast on the shore
786,CONSTABLE JINKS,Our village policeman was much to the fore;

790,CONSTABLE JINKS,When a small boy was flying his kite on the links
791,CONSTABLE JINKS,"It was promptly impounded by Constable Jinks,"

795,CONSTABLE JINKS,It is sometimes alleged that great valour he showed
796,CONSTABLE JINKS,When he chased a mad cow for three miles on the road;

805,CONSTABLE JINKS,His _obiter dicta_ on life and the law
806,CONSTABLE JINKS,Set our ribald young folk in a frequent guffaw;

808,CONSTABLE JINKS,In so splendid a product of beer and of beef.
809,CONSTABLE JINKS,
810,CONSTABLE JINKS,"He’s the strongest and solidest man in the place,"
811,CONSTABLE JINKS,Nothing—short of mad cattle—can quicken his pace;
812,CONSTABLE JINKS,"His moustache would do credit to any dragoon,"
813,CONSTABLE JINKS,And his voice is as deep as a double bassoon.
814,CONSTABLE JINKS,
815,CONSTABLE JINKS,"His complexion is perfect, his uniform neat,"
816,CONSTABLE JINKS,He rivets all eyes as he stalks down the street;
817,CONSTABLE JINKS,And I doubt if his critics will ever complain
818,CONSTABLE JINKS,Of his being a little deficient in brain.
819,CONSTABLE JINKS,
820,CONSTABLE JINKS,For he’s more than a man; he’s a part of the map;
821,CONSTABLE JINKS,His going would cause a deplorable gap;

823,CONSTABLE JINKS,As it would from the loss of the old parish pump.

1215,THE FLAPPER,She’s an orgiastic nuisance who in fact _enjoys_ the War.
1216,THE FLAPPER,
1217,THE FLAPPER,It’s a strenuous indictment of our petticoated youth
1218,THE FLAPPER,And contains a large substratum of unpalatable truth;
1219,THE FLAPPER,"Our women have been splendid, but the Sun himself has specks,"
1220,THE FLAPPER,And the flapper can’t be reckoned as a credit to her sex.
1221,THE FLAPPER,
1222,THE FLAPPER,"Still it needs to be remembered, to extenuate her crimes,"
1223,THE FLAPPER,That these flappers have not always had the very best of times;
1224,THE FLAPPER,"And the life that now she’s leading, with no Mentors to restrain,"

1227,THE FLAPPER,"Then again we only see her when she’s out for play or meals,"
1228,THE FLAPPER,"And distresses the fastidious by her gestures and her squeals,"

1230,THE FLAPPER,"And if she wastes her wages, well, she wastes what is her own."
1231,THE FLAPPER,
1232,THE FLAPPER,"Still to say that she’s heroic, as some scribes of late have said,"

1713,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,
1714,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"Now, as most of the food that we eat"
1715,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"Is wanted for keeping us warm,"
1716,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,The requisite quota of heat

1718,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"And the ratio of surface to weight,"
1719,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"As anyone readily twigs,"
1720,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,Is the root of the point in debate
1721,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,As sagely expounded by SPRIGGS.
1722,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,
1723,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,Hence the more we resemble a sphere
1724,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"Less heat on the surface is lost,"
1725,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"And the needful supply, it is clear,"
1726,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,Is maintained at less lavish a cost;

1731,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,
1732,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"Next, the harder it freezes or snows"
1733,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"The greater the value of fat,"

1736,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"(Conversely, in Midsummer days,"

1746,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,Everlastingly puffing at “cigs”
1747,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"Can live pretty nearly on air,"
1748,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,So I gather at least from my SPRIGGS.
1749,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,
1750,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,Why children need plentiful food
1751,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,He nextly proceeds to relate:
1752,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,Their capacity’s larger than you’d
1753,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,Be disposed to infer from their weight;
1754,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"They’re growing in bulk and in height,"
1755,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"They’re normally active as grigs,"
1756,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,And exercise breeds appetite—
1757,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,This stanza is absolute SPRIGGS.
1758,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,
1759,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"Last of all, with an eloquent plea"
1760,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,For porridge at breakfast in place
1761,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"Of the loaf, and for oatcake at tea"
1762,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,A similar gap to efface;
1763,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"For potatoless dinners—with rice,"
1764,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"For puddings of maize and of figs,"
1765,A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING,"Which are filling, nutritious and nice—"

1783,A QUEUE SONG,
1784,A QUEUE SONG,Carnivorous folk might ask for more
1785,A QUEUE SONG,"Than _Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_,"
