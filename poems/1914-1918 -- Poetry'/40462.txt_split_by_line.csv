60,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,It Was the Road to Jericho
61,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
62,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
63,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"It was the road to Jericho,"
64,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,And brave indeed the man
65,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Who went alone and waited not
66,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,To join the caravan.
67,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
68,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,For robber hoards swooped down the cliffs
69,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"Like eagles on their prey,"
70,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"And mercy was not known to them,"
71,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Theirs but to kill and slay.

75,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
76,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Along the road to Jericho
77,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"A man went riding by,"
78,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"He heard a groan of mortal pain,"
79,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,He heard a piercing cry.
80,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
81,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,[Illustration]
82,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
83,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
84,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"He got him down from off his beast,"
85,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"He found the one who bled,"
86,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,The thieves had bruised and beaten him
87,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,And left him well nigh dead.
88,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
89,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"(The Levite and the priest had passed,"
90,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,The calls to them were vain).
91,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,He bound his wounds. With oil and wine
92,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,He eased the grevious pain.
93,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
94,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Then to the inn he carried him
95,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"And paid the keeper's price,"
96,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"As one who does a deed for love,"
97,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Nor counts it sacrifice.
98,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
99,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"Lo, as he passed upon his way,"
100,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,His robe it showed a stain--
101,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"Two red marks on his white sleeve, where"
102,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,The bleeding head had lain.
103,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
104,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"One, made in pity when he stooped"
105,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"To lift the wounded up,"
106,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"The other, when in love he bent"
107,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,To offer him the cup.
108,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
109,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,[Illustration]
110,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
111,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"Two red, red lines which made a cross,"
112,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,And marked him as the man
113,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"Whose name is, till the end of time"
114,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"""The good Samaritan."""

121,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,[Illustration]
122,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
123,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"The World pressed toward its Jericho,"
124,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,The goal of its desire--
125,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"Its marts, its pleasures and its shrines"
126,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Its dreams of great empire.
127,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
128,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,A hoard of gold it bore along
129,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,To barter and to buy.
130,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"But on the road, by thieves beset,"
131,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"It, too, was left to die."
132,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
133,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,The Son of God came down that way
134,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"To succour and to save,"
135,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"To bind its wounds, to heal its sin"
136,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,To lift it from the grave.
137,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
138,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"Lo! He too, went upon His way"
139,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,When He had paid the price.
140,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Marked by the red red lines that make
141,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,The Cross of Sacrifice.
142,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
143,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,[Illustration]
144,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
145,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Where all the woe of all the world
146,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Upon His heart had lain
147,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,And all the sin of earth pressed sore
148,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,There gleamed that double stain.
149,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
150,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,And now we cannot name His name
151,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"Who is the Lord of Heaven,"
152,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Without a thought of that symbol
153,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,By love and pity given.
154,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
155,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Now onward to our Jericho
156,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,We press with bated breath.
157,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"For evil grows the way, and dark."
158,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,On every hand stalks death.

163,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Part III
164,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
165,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,[Illustration]
166,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
167,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,The robber hoards that strip and slay
168,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"Take more than gold, forsooth,"
169,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,They kill our holiest of Hopes--
170,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,They take all Love--all Youth!
171,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
172,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,They smite the mother and the maid--
173,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"The babe that cries unfed,"
174,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"And little children, sore afraid"
175,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Sob in the night for bread.
176,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
177,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,[Illustration]
178,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
179,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"Oh, who shall staunch such world-wide woe--"
180,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Such universe of pain?
181,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,And who has oil and wine enough?
182,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,And must they cry in vain?
183,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
184,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,[Illustration]
185,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
186,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Nay! On the road to Jericho
187,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"There be a million now,"
188,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,"Who bear Christ's pity in their hearts,"
189,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,His sign upon their brow.
190,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
191,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,And millions more shall follow them
192,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,To bind and to restore.
193,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Till all the highway is made safe
194,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,And war shall be no more.
195,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,
196,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,Now God give grace to all who hear
197,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,And may His love suffice
198,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,To blaze upon each heart each day
199,BRITTON PUBLISHING COMPANY,The Cross of Sacrifice.
