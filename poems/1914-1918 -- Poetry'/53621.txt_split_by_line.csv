47,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","DUNSANY CASTLE,"
48,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
49,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","_June,_ 1914."
50,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
51,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","If one who looked from a tower for a new star, watching for years the"
52,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","same part of the sky, suddenly saw it (quite by chance while thinking"
53,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","of other things), and knew it for the star for which he had hoped, how"
54,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",many millions of men would never care?
55,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
56,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","And the star might blaze over deserts and forests and seas, cheering"
57,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","lost wanderers in desolate lands, or guiding dangerous quests; millions"
58,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",would never know it. And a poet is no more than a star. If one has
59,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","arisen where I have so long looked for one, amongst the Irish peasants,"
60,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",it can be little more than a secret that I shall share with those who
61,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",read this book because they care for poetry.
62,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
63,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",I have looked for a poet amongst the Irish peasants because it seemed
64,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",to me that almost only amongst them there was in daily use a diction
65,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","worthy of poetry, as well a an imagination capable of dealing with the"
66,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",great and simple things that are a poet's wares. Their thoughts are in
67,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","the spring-time, and all their metaphors fresh: in London no one makes"
68,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","metaphors any more, but daily speech is strewn thickly with dead ones"
69,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",that their users should write upon paper and give to their gardeners to
70,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",burn.
71,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
72,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","In this same London, two years ago, where I was wasting June, I"
73,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",received a letter one day from Mr. Ledwidge and a very old copy-book.
74,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",The letter asked whether there was any good in the verses that filled
75,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","the copy-book, the produce apparently of four or five years. It began"
76,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","with a play in verse that no manager would dream of, there were"
77,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","mistakes in grammar, in spelling of course, and worse--there were such"
78,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","phrases as ""'thwart the rolling foam,"" ""waiting for my true love on"
79,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","the lea,"" etc., which are vulgarly considered to be the appurtenances"
80,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",of poetry; but out of these and many similar errors there arose
81,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","continually, like a mountain sheer out of marshes, that easy fluency of"
82,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",shapely lines which is now so noticeable in all that he writes; that
83,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",and sudden glimpses of the fields that he seems at times to bring so
84,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","near to one that one exclaims, ""Why, that is how Meath looks,"" or ""It"
85,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","is just like that along the Boyne in April,"" quite taken by surprise by"
86,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","familiar things: for none of us knows, till the poets point them out,"
87,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",how many beautiful things are close about us.
88,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
89,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","Of pure poetry there are two kinds, that which mirrors the beauty of"
90,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","the world in which our bodies are, and that which builds the more"
91,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","mysterious kingdoms where geography ends and fairyland begins, with"
92,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","gods and heroes at war, and the sirens singing still, and Alph going"
93,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",down to the darkness from Xanadu. Mr. Ledwidge gives us the first
94,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","kind. When they have read through the profounder poets, and seen the"
95,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","problem plays, and studied all the perplexities that puzzle man in the"
96,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","cities, the small circle of readers that I predict for him will turn to"
97,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","Ledwidge as to a mirror reflecting beautiful fields, as to a very still"
98,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",lake rather on a very cloudless evening.
99,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
100,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",There is scarcely a smile of Spring or a sigh of Autumn that is not
101,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","reflected here, scarcely a phase of the large benedictions of Summer;"
102,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","even of Winter he gives us clear glimpses sometimes, albeit mournfully,"
103,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",remembering Spring.
104,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
105,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","""In the red west the twisted moon is low,"
106,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","And on the bubbles there are half-lit stars,"
107,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",Music and twilight: and the deep blue flow
108,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",Of water: and the watching fire of Mars.
109,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",The deep fish slipping through the moonlit bars
110,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","Make death a thing of sweet dreams,--"""
111,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
112,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",What a Summer's evening is here.
113,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
114,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",And this is a Summer's night in a much longer poem that I have not
115,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","included in this selection, a summer's night seen by two lovers:"
116,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
117,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","""The large moon rose up queenly as a flower"
118,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","Charmed by some Indian pipes. A hare went by,"
119,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","A snipe above them circled in the sky."""
120,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
121,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","And elsewhere he writes, giving us the mood and picture of Autumn in a"
122,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",single line:
123,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
124,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","""And somewhere all the wandering birds have flown."""
125,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
126,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","With such simple scenes as this the book is full, giving nothing at all"
127,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","to those that look for a ""message,"" but bringing a feeling of quiet"
128,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","from gleaming Irish evenings, a book to read between the Strand and"
129,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",Piccadilly Circus amidst the thunder and hootings.
130,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
131,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",To every poet is given the revelation of some living thing so intimate
132,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","that he speaks, when he speaks of it, as an ambassador speaking for his"
133,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","sovereign; with Homer it was the heroes, with Ledwidge it is the small"
134,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","birds that sing, but in particular especially the blackbird, whose"
135,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",cause he champions against all other birds almost with a vehemence
136,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","such as that with which men discuss whether Mr. ----, M. P., or his"
137,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",friend the Right Honourable ---- is really the greater ruffian. This
138,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",is how he speaks of the blackbird in one of his earliest poems; he was
139,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","sixteen when he wrote it, in a grocer's shop in Dublin, dreaming of"
140,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","Slane, where he was born; and his dreams turned out to be too strong"
141,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","for the grocery business, for he walked home one night, a distance of"
142,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",thirty miles:
143,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
144,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","""Above me smokes the little town"
145,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",With its whitewashed walls and roofs of brown
146,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",And its octagon spire toned smoothly down
147,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",As the holy minds within.
148,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","And wondrous, impudently sweet,"
149,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","Half of him passion, half conceit,"
150,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","The blackbird calls adown the street,"
151,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","Like the piper of Hamelin."""
152,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
153,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","Let us not call him the Burns of Ireland, you who may like this book,"
154,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","nor even the Irish John Clare, though he is more like him, for poets"
155,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",are all incomparable (it is only the versifiers that resemble the great
156,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","ones), but let us know him by his own individual song: he is the poet"
157,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",of the blackbird.
158,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",
159,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",I hope that not too many will be attracted to this book on account
160,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","of the author being a peasant, lest he come to be praised by the"
161,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","how-interesting! school; for know that neither in any class, nor in any"
162,"DUNSANY CASTLE,","country, nor in any age, shall you predict the footfall of Pegasus, who"
163,"DUNSANY CASTLE,",touches the earth where he pleaseth and is bridled by whom he will.

199,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
200,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","_September,_ 1916."
201,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
202,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",In this selection that Corporal Ledwidge has asked me to make from his
203,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","poems I have included ""A Dream of Artemis,"" though it was incomplete"
204,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",and has been hurriedly finished Were it not included on that account
205,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",many lines of extraordinary beauty would remain unseen. He asked me if
206,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","I did not think that it ended too abruptly, but so many pleasant things"
207,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","ended abruptly in the summer of 1914, when this poem was being written,"
208,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","that the blame for that may rest on a meaner, though more, exalted,"
209,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",head than that of the poet.
210,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
211,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","In this poem, as in the other one that has a classical theme, ""The"
212,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Departure of Proserpine,"" those who remember their classics may find"
213,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","faults, but I read the ""Dream of Artemis"" merely as an expression of"
214,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","things that the poet has seen and dreamed in Meath, including a most"
215,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","beautiful description of a fox-hunt in the north of the county, in"
216,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","which he has probably taken part on foot; and in ""The Departure of"
217,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Proserpine,"" whether conscious or not, a crystallization in verse of"
218,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",an autumnal mood induced by falling leaves and exile and the possible
219,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",nearness of death.
220,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
221,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",The second poem in the book was written about a little boy who used
222,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",to drive cows for some farmer past the poet's door very early every
223,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","morning, whistling as he went, and who died just before the war. I"
224,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",think that its beautiful and spontaneous simplicity would cost some of
225,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",our writers gallons of midnight oil.
226,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
227,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Of the next, ""To a Distant One,"" who will not hope that when ""Fame and"
228,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","other little things are won"" its clear and confident prophecy will be"
229,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",happily fulfilled?
230,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
231,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Quite perfect, if my judgment is of any value, is the little poem on"
232,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","page 175, ""In the Mediterranean--Going to the War."""
233,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
234,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Another beautiful thing is ""Homecoming"" on page 192."
235,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
236,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","""The sheep are coming home in Greece,"
237,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Hark the bells on every hill,"
238,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Flock by flock and fleece by fleece."""
239,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
240,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","One feels that the Greeks are of some use, after all, to have"
241,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",inspired--with the help of their sheep--so lovely a poem.
242,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
243,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","""The Shadow People"" on page 205 seems to me another perfect poem."
244,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Written in Serbia and Egypt, it shows the poet still looking"
245,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","steadfastly at those fields, though so far distant then, of which he"
246,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",was surely born to be the singer. And this devotion to the fields of
247,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Meath that, in nearly all his songs, from such far places brings his"
248,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","spirit home, like the instinct that has been given to the swallows,"
249,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",seems to be the key-note of the book. For this reason I have named it
250,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","_Songs of Peace,_ in spite of the circumstances under which they were"
251,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",written.
252,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
253,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","There follow poems at which some may wonder: ""To Thomas McDonagh,"" ""The"
254,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Blackbirds,"" ""The Wedding Morning""; but rather than attribute curious"
255,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",sympathies to this brave young Irish soldier I would ask his readers to
256,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",consider the irresistible attraction that a lost cause has for almost
257,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",any Irish-man.
258,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",
259,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Once the swallow instinct appears again--in the poem called ""The"
260,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","Lure""--and a longing for the South, and again in the poem called"
261,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","""Song"": and then the Irish fields content him again, and we find him"
262,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,",on the last page but one in the book making a poem for a little place
263,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","called Faughan, because he finds that its hills and woods and streams"
264,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","are unsung. Surely for this if there be, as many believed, gods lesser"
265,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","than Those whose business is with destiny, thunder and war, small gods"
266,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","that haunt the groves, seen only at times by few, and then indistinctly"
267,"EBRINGTON BARRACKS,","at evening, surely from gratitude they will give him peace."

279,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","_October 9th,_ 1917."
280,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",
281,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",Writing amidst rather too much noise and squalor to do justice at all
282,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","to the delicate rustic muse of Francis Ledwidge, I do not like to delay"
283,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","his book any longer, nor to fail in a promise long ago made to him to"
284,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",write this introduction. He has gone down in that vast maelstrom into
285,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",which poets do well to adventure and from which their country might
286,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","perhaps be wise to withhold them, but that is our Country's affair. He"
287,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","has left behind him verses of great beauty, simple rural lyrics that"
288,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",may be something of an anodyne for this stricken age. If ever an age
289,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",needed beautiful little songs our age needs them; and I know few songs
290,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","more peaceful and happy, or better suited to soothe the scars on the"
291,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","mind of those who have looked on certain places, of which the prophecy"
292,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",in the gospels seems no more than an ominous hint when it speaks of the
293,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",abomination of desolation.
294,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",
295,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","He told me once that it was on one particular occasion, when walking"
296,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","at evening through the village of Slane in summer, that he heard a"
297,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","blackbird sing. The notes, he said, were very beautiful, and it is"
298,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",this blackbird that he tells of in three wonderful lines in his early
299,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","poem called ""Behind the Closed Eye,"" and it is this song perhaps more"
300,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",than anything else that has been the inspiration of his brief life.
301,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","Dynasties shook and the earth shook; and the war, not yet described by"
302,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","any man, revelled and wallowed in destruction around him; and Francis"
303,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,","Ledwidge stayed true to his inspiration, as his homeward songs will"
304,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",show.
305,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",
306,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",I had hoped he would have seen the fame he has well deserved; but it is
307,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",hard for a poet to live to see fame even in times of peace. In these
308,"THE HINDENBERG LINE,",days it is harder than ever.

484,TO MY BEST FRIEND,That stirs the poppy on the sun-burned ledge
485,TO MY BEST FRIEND,"And like a swan dies singing, without pain."
486,TO MY BEST FRIEND,The golden bees go buzzing down to stain
487,TO MY BEST FRIEND,"The lilies' frills, and the blue harebell rings,"

611,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,Within the oak a throb of pigeon wings
612,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,"Fell silent, and grey twilight hushed the fold,"
613,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,And spiders' hammocks swung on half-oped things
614,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,That shook like foreigners upon our cold.
615,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,A gipsy lit a fire and made a sound
616,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,"Of moving tins, and from an oblong moon"
617,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,The river seemed to gush across the ground
618,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,To the cracked metre of a marching tune.
619,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,
620,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,And then three syllables of melody
621,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,"Dropped from a blackbird's flute, and died apart"

623,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,Yet sweeter music never touched a heart
624,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,"Neath the blue domes of London. Flute and reed,"
625,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,Suggesting feelings of the solitude
626,A TWILIGHT IN MIDDLE MARCH,"When will was all the Delphi I would heed,"

717,A RAINY DAY IN APRIL,"To deck the pathway that his feet must tread,"
718,A RAINY DAY IN APRIL,"To fringe the 'broidery of the roses' bed,"

1244,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,Save where the wall was broken and long waves
1245,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,"Of yellow grass flowed outward like a weir,"
1246,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,As if the dead were striving for more room
1247,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,And their old places in the scheme of things;
1248,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,For sometimes the thought comes that the brown tomb
1249,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,"Is not the end of all our labourings,"
1250,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,"But we are born once more of wind and rain,"
1251,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,"To sow the world with harvest young and strong,"
1252,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,"That men may live by men 'til the stars wane,"
1253,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,And still sweet music fill the blackbird's song.
1254,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,
1255,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,But O for truths about the soul denied.
1256,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,"Shall I meet Keats in some wild isle of balm,"
1257,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,Dreaming beside a tarn where green and wide
1258,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,Boughs of sweet cinnamon protect the calm
1259,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,Of the dark water? And together walk
1260,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,Thro' hills with dimples full of water where
1261,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,"White angels rest, and all the dead years talk"
1262,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,About the changes of the earth? Despair
1263,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,Sometimes takes hold of me but yet I hope
1264,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,To hope the old hope in the better times
1265,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,When I am free to cast aside the rope
1266,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,That binds me to all sadness 'till my rhymes
1267,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,"Cry like lost birds. But O, if I should die"
1268,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,"Ere this millennium, and my hands be crossed"
1269,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,"Under the flowers I loved, the passers-by"
1270,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,Shall scowl at me as one whose soul is lost.
1271,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,
1272,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,But a soft peace came to me when the West
1273,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,Shut its red door and a thin streak of moon
1274,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,Was twisted on the twilight's dusky breast.
1275,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,It wrapped me up as sometimes a sweet tune
1276,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,"Heard for the first time wraps the scenes around,"
1277,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,That we may have their memories when some hand
1278,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,Strikes it in other times and hopes unbound
1279,THE VISITATION OF PEACE,Rising see clear the everlasting land.

1285,BEFORE THE TEARS,
1286,BEFORE THE TEARS,
1287,BEFORE THE TEARS,You looked as sad as an eclipséd moon
1288,BEFORE THE TEARS,"Above the sheaves of harvest, and there lay"
1289,BEFORE THE TEARS,"A light lisp on your tongue, and very soon"
1290,BEFORE THE TEARS,The petals of your deep blush fell away;
1291,BEFORE THE TEARS,White smiles that come with an uneasy grace
1292,BEFORE THE TEARS,"From inner sorrow crossed your forehead fair,"
1293,BEFORE THE TEARS,When the wind passing took your scattered hair
1294,BEFORE THE TEARS,And flung it like a brown shower in my face.
1295,BEFORE THE TEARS,
1296,BEFORE THE TEARS,Tear-fringéd winds that fill the heart's low sighs
1297,BEFORE THE TEARS,"And never break upon the bosom's pain,"
1298,BEFORE THE TEARS,But blow unto the windows of the eyes
1299,BEFORE THE TEARS,"Their misty promises of silver rain,"
1300,BEFORE THE TEARS,Around your loud heart ever rose and fell.
1301,BEFORE THE TEARS,I thought 'twere better that the tears should come
1302,BEFORE THE TEARS,"And strike your every feeling wholly numb,"
1303,BEFORE THE TEARS,So thrust my hand in yours and shook fare-well.

1314,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,"Shook his lean bones, and every coloured tree"

1316,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,Of nests among the branches one old crow
1317,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,With gaps upon his wings flew far away.
1318,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,"And, thinking of the golden summer glow,"
1319,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,I heard a blackbird whistle half his lay
1320,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,Among the spinning leaves that slanted down.
1321,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,
1322,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,And I who am a thought of God's now long
1323,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,"Forgotten in His Mind, and desolate"

1325,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,"Singing upon the wind the anvil song,"
1326,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,Sang of the Spring when first He dreamt of me
1327,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,In that old town all hills and signs that creak:--
1328,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,And He remembered me as something far
1329,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,"In old imaginations, something weak"
1330,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,"With distance, like a little sparking star"
1331,GOD'S REMEMBRANCE,Drowned in the lavender of evening sea.

1340,AN OLD PAIN,What old and wandering dream forgotten long
1341,AN OLD PAIN,"Hobbles back to my mind? With faces two,"
1342,AN OLD PAIN,"Like Janus of old Rome, I look about,"
1343,AN OLD PAIN,And yet discover not what ancient wrong
1344,AN OLD PAIN,Lies unrequited still. No speck of doubt
1345,AN OLD PAIN,Upon to-morrow's promise. Yet a pain
1346,AN OLD PAIN,"Of some dumb thing is on me, and I feel"
1347,AN OLD PAIN,"How men go mad, how faculties do reel"
1348,AN OLD PAIN,When these old querns turn round within the brain.

1350,AN OLD PAIN,"'Tis something to have known one day of joy,"
1351,AN OLD PAIN,"Now to remember when the heart is low,"

1354,AN OLD PAIN,"By'n by the purple cups that overflow,"
1355,AN OLD PAIN,And fill the shattered heart's urn to the brink.
1356,AN OLD PAIN,But some are dead who laughed! Some scattered are
1357,AN OLD PAIN,Around the sultry breadth of foreign zones.
1358,AN OLD PAIN,"You, with the warm clay wrapt about your bones,"
1359,AN OLD PAIN,Are nearer to me than the live afar.
1360,AN OLD PAIN,
1361,AN OLD PAIN,"My heart has grown as dry as an old crust,"
1362,AN OLD PAIN,"Deep in book lumber and moth-eaten wood,"

1364,AN OLD PAIN,"So long forgot the thing that made youth dear,"
1365,AN OLD PAIN,"Two blue love lamps, a heart exceeding good,"
1366,AN OLD PAIN,"And how, when first I heard that voice ring clear"
1367,AN OLD PAIN,"Among the sering hedges of the plain,"
1368,AN OLD PAIN,"I knew not which from which beyond the corn,"
1369,AN OLD PAIN,"The laughter by the callow twisted thorn,"

1371,AN OLD PAIN,
1372,AN OLD PAIN,"I hold the mind is the imprisoned soul,"
1373,AN OLD PAIN,And all our aspirations are its own
1374,AN OLD PAIN,"Struggles and strivings for a golden goal,"
1375,AN OLD PAIN,That wear us out like snow men at the thaw.
1376,AN OLD PAIN,And we shall make our Heaven where we have sown
1377,AN OLD PAIN,Our purple longings. Oh! can the loved dead draw
1378,AN OLD PAIN,"Anear us when we moan, or watching wait"
1379,AN OLD PAIN,"Our coming in the woods where first we met,"
1380,AN OLD PAIN,"The dead leaves falling on their wild hair wet,"
1381,AN OLD PAIN,Their hands upon the fastenings of the gate?
1382,AN OLD PAIN,
1383,AN OLD PAIN,"This is the old, old pain come home once more,"
1384,AN OLD PAIN,Bent down with answers wild and very lame
1385,AN OLD PAIN,For all my delving in old dog-eared lore
1386,AN OLD PAIN,That drove the Sages mad. And boots the world
1387,AN OLD PAIN,"Aught for their wisdom? I have asked them, tame,"
1388,AN OLD PAIN,And watched the Earth by its own self be hurled
1389,AN OLD PAIN,"Atom by atom into nothingness,"
1390,AN OLD PAIN,"Loll out of the deep canyons, drops of fixe,"
1391,AN OLD PAIN,"And kindle on the hills its funeral pyre,"
1392,AN OLD PAIN,And all we learn but shows we know the less.

2065,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,
2066,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,
2067,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,There was soft beauty on the linnet's tongue
2068,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,To see the rainbow's coloured bands arch wide.
2069,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,The thunder darted his red fangs among
2070,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"South mountains, but the East was like a bride"
2071,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Drest for the altar at her mother's door
2072,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Weeping between two loves. The fields were pied
2073,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"With May's munificence of flowers, that wore"
2074,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"The fashion of the days when Eve was young,"
2075,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"God's kirtles, ere the first sweet summer died."
2076,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,The blackbird in a thorn of waving white
2077,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Sang bouquets of small tunes that bid me turn
2078,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,From twilight wanderings thro' some old delight
2079,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,I heard in my far memory making mourn.
2080,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Such music fills me with a joy half pain,"
2081,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,And beats a track across my life I spurn
2082,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"In sober moments. Ah, this wandering brain"
2083,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Could play its hurdy-gurdy all the night
2084,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,To vagrant joys of days beyond the bourn.
2085,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,
2086,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,I heard the river warble sweetly nigh
2087,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"To meet the warm salt tide below the weir,"
2088,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"And saw a coloured line of cows pass by,--"
2089,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"And then a voice said quickly, ""Iris here!"""
2090,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"""What message now hath Hera?"" then I woke,"
2091,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"An exile in Arcadia, and a spear"
2092,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Flashed by me, and ten nymphs fleet-footed broke"
2093,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Out of the coppice with a silver cry,"
2094,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Into the bow of lights to disappear.
2095,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,
2096,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,For one blue minute then there was no sound
2097,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Save water-noise, slow round a rushy bend,"
2098,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"And bird-delight, and ripples on the ground"
2099,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Of windy flowers that swelling would ascend
2100,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,The coloured hill and break all beautiful
2101,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"And, falling backwards, to the woods would send"
2102,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,The full tide of their love. What soft moons pull
2103,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Their moving fragrance? did I ask, and found"
2104,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Sad Io in far Egypt met a friend.--
2105,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"It was my body thought so, far away"
2106,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"In the grey future, not the wild bird tied"
2107,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,That is the wandering soul. Behind the day
2108,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"We may behold thee, soft one, hunted wide"
2109,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,By the loud gadfly; but the truant soul
2110,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Knows thee before thou lay by night's dark side,"
2111,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Wed to the dimness; long before its dole
2112,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Was meted it, to be thus pound in clay--"
2113,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,That daubs its whiteness and offends its pride.
2114,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,
2115,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"There were loud questions in the rainbow's end,"
2116,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"And hurried answers, and a sound of spears."
2117,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,And through the yellow blaze I saw one bend
2118,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Down on a trembling white knee, and her tears"
2119,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Fell down in globes of light, and her small mouth"
2120,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Was filled up with a name unspoken. Years
2121,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Of waiting love, and all their long, long drought"
2122,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Of kisses parched her lips, and did she spend"
2123,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Her eyes blue candles searching thro' her fears.
2124,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"""She hath loved Ganymede, the stolen boy."""
2125,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Said one, and then another, ""Let us sing"
2126,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,To Zeus that he may give her living joy
2127,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"Above Olympus, where the cool hill-spring"
2128,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Of Lethe bubbles up to bathe the heart
2129,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Sorrow's lean fingers bruised. There eagles wing
2130,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"To eyries in the stars, and when they part"
2131,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,Their broad dark wings a wind is born to buoy
2132,A DREAM OF ARTEMIS,"The bee home heavy in the far evening."""

2140,HYMN TO ZEUS,"The rainbow showers on hill and lawn,"

2146,HYMN TO ZEUS,Upon the river's liquid words.
2147,HYMN TO ZEUS,Reach out a golden beam of thine
2148,HYMN TO ZEUS,And touch her pain. Your finger-tips
2149,HYMN TO ZEUS,Do make the violets' blue eclipse
2150,HYMN TO ZEUS,Like milk upon a daisy shine.
2151,HYMN TO ZEUS,
2152,HYMN TO ZEUS,"God, who lights the little stars,"
2153,HYMN TO ZEUS,And over night the white dew spills.
2154,HYMN TO ZEUS,Whose hand doth move the season's cars

2165,HYMN TO ZEUS,"The rainbow's lights were shut, and all the maids"

2168,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Me to the fingers. Lo, I upward swing!"""
2169,HYMN TO ZEUS,And round her fell a mantle of blue light.
2170,HYMN TO ZEUS,"""Watch for me on the forehead of evening."""
2171,HYMN TO ZEUS,And lifting beautiful went out of sight.
2172,HYMN TO ZEUS,"And all the flowers flowed backward from the glades,"
2173,HYMN TO ZEUS,An ebb of colours redolent of Spring.
2174,HYMN TO ZEUS,
2175,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Beauty and Love are sisters of the heart,"
2176,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Love has no voice, and Beauty whispered song."
2177,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Now in my own, drawn silently apart"
2178,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Love looked, and Beauty sang. I felt a strong"
2179,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Pulse on my wrist, a feeling like a pain"
2180,HYMN TO ZEUS,"In my quick heart, for Love with gazes long"
2181,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Was worshipping at Artemis, now lain"
2182,HYMN TO ZEUS,Among the heaving flowers ... I longed to dart
2183,HYMN TO ZEUS,"And fold her to my breast, nor saw the wrong."
2184,HYMN TO ZEUS,"She lay there, a tall beauty by her spear,"
2185,HYMN TO ZEUS,Her kirtle falling to her soft round knee.
2186,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Her hair was like the day when evening's near,"
2187,HYMN TO ZEUS,And her moist mouth might tempt the golden bee.
2188,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Smile's creases ran from dimples pink and deep,"
2189,HYMN TO ZEUS,And when she raised her arms I loved to see
2190,HYMN TO ZEUS,The white mounds of her muscles. Gentle sleep
2191,HYMN TO ZEUS,Threatened her far blue looks. The noisy weir
2192,HYMN TO ZEUS,Fell into a low murmuring lullaby.
2193,HYMN TO ZEUS,And then the flowers came back behind the heel
2194,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Of hunted Io: she, poor maid, had fear"
2195,HYMN TO ZEUS,Wide in her eyes looking half back to steal
2196,HYMN TO ZEUS,A glimpse of the loud gadfly fiercely near.
2197,HYMN TO ZEUS,"In her right hand she held Planting light,"
2198,HYMN TO ZEUS,And in her left her train. Artemis here
2199,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Raised herself on her palms, and took a white"
2200,HYMN TO ZEUS,Horn from her side and blew a silver peal
2201,HYMN TO ZEUS,Til three hounds from the coppice did appear.
2202,HYMN TO ZEUS,
2203,HYMN TO ZEUS,"The white nine left the spaces of flowers, and now"
2204,HYMN TO ZEUS,Went calling thro' the wood the hunter's call.
2205,HYMN TO ZEUS,Young echoes sleeping in the hollow bough
2206,HYMN TO ZEUS,Took up the shouts and handed them to all
2207,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Their sisters of the crags, 'til all the day"
2208,HYMN TO ZEUS,Was filled with voices loud and musical.
2209,HYMN TO ZEUS,I followed them across a tangled way
2210,HYMN TO ZEUS,'Til the red deer broke out and took the brow
2211,HYMN TO ZEUS,Of a wide hill in bounces like a ball.
2212,HYMN TO ZEUS,Beside swift Artemis I joined the chase;
2213,HYMN TO ZEUS,We roused up kine and scattered fleecy flocks;
2214,HYMN TO ZEUS,Crossed at a mill a swift and bubbly race;
2215,HYMN TO ZEUS,Scaled in a wood of pine the knotty rocks;
2216,HYMN TO ZEUS,Past a grey vision of a valley town;
2217,HYMN TO ZEUS,Past swains at labour in their coloured frocks;
2218,HYMN TO ZEUS,Once saw a boar upon a windy down;
2219,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Once heard a cradle in a lonely place,"
2220,HYMN TO ZEUS,And saw the red flash of a frightened fox.
2221,HYMN TO ZEUS,
2222,HYMN TO ZEUS,We passed a garden where three maids in blue
2223,HYMN TO ZEUS,Were talking of a queen a long time dead.
2224,HYMN TO ZEUS,We caught a green glimpse of the sea: then thro'
2225,HYMN TO ZEUS,A town all hills; now round a wood we sped
2226,HYMN TO ZEUS,And killed our quarry in his native lair.
2227,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Then Artemis spun round to me and said,"
2228,HYMN TO ZEUS,"""Whence come you?"" and I took her long damp hair"
2229,HYMN TO ZEUS,"And made a ball of it, and said, ""Where you"
2230,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Are midnight's dreams of love."" She dropped her head,"
2231,HYMN TO ZEUS,"No word she spoke, but, panting in her side,"
2232,HYMN TO ZEUS,"I heard her heart. The trees were all at peace,"
2233,HYMN TO ZEUS,And lifting slowly on the grey evetide
2234,HYMN TO ZEUS,A large and lovely star. Then to release
2235,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Her hair, my hand dropped to her girded waist"
2236,HYMN TO ZEUS,"And lay there shyly. ""O my love, the lease"
2237,HYMN TO ZEUS,Of your existence is for ever: taste
2238,HYMN TO ZEUS,"No less with me the love of earth,"" I cried."
2239,HYMN TO ZEUS,"""Though for so short a while on lands and seas"
2240,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Our mortal hearts know beauty, and overblow,"
2241,HYMN TO ZEUS,"And we are dust upon some passing wind,"
2242,HYMN TO ZEUS,Dust and a memory. But for you the snow
2243,HYMN TO ZEUS,That so long cloaks the mountains to the knees
2244,HYMN TO ZEUS,Is no more than a morning. It doth go
2245,HYMN TO ZEUS,"And summer comes, and leaf upon the trees:"
2246,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Still you are fair and young, and nothing find"
2247,HYMN TO ZEUS,In all man's story that seems long ago.
2248,HYMN TO ZEUS,"I have not loved on Earth the strife for gold,"
2249,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Nor the great name that makes immortal man,"
2250,HYMN TO ZEUS,But all that struggle upward to behold
2251,HYMN TO ZEUS,"What still is left of Beauty undisgraced,"
2252,HYMN TO ZEUS,The snowdrop at the heel of winter cold
2253,HYMN TO ZEUS,"And shivering, and the wayward cuckoo chased"
2254,HYMN TO ZEUS,"By lingering March, and, in the thunder's van"
2255,HYMN TO ZEUS,"The poor lambs merry on the meagre wold,"
2256,HYMN TO ZEUS,"By-ways and cast-off things that lie therein,"
2257,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Old boots that trod the highways of the world,"
2258,HYMN TO ZEUS,"The schoolboy's broken hoop, the battered bin"
2259,HYMN TO ZEUS,"That heard the ragman's story, blackened places"
2260,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Where gipsies camped and circuses made din,"
2261,HYMN TO ZEUS,Fast water and the melancholy traces
2262,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Of sea tides, and poor people madly whirled"
2263,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Up, down, and through the black retreats of sin."
2264,HYMN TO ZEUS,"These things a god might love, and stooping bless"
2265,HYMN TO ZEUS,With benedictions of eternal song.--
2266,HYMN TO ZEUS,But I have not loved Artemis the less
2267,HYMN TO ZEUS,"For loving these, but deem it noble love"
2268,HYMN TO ZEUS,To sing of live or dead things in distress
2269,HYMN TO ZEUS,And wake memorial memories above.
2270,HYMN TO ZEUS,
2271,HYMN TO ZEUS,Such is the soul that comes to plead with you
2272,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Oh, Artemis, to tend you in your needs."
2273,HYMN TO ZEUS,At mornings I will bring you bells of dew
2274,HYMN TO ZEUS,"From honey places, and wild fish from, streams"
2275,HYMN TO ZEUS,Flowing in secret places. I will brew
2276,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Sweet wine of alder for your evening dreams,"
2277,HYMN TO ZEUS,And pipe you music in the dusky reeds
2278,HYMN TO ZEUS,When the four distances give up their blue.
2279,HYMN TO ZEUS,
2280,HYMN TO ZEUS,And when the white procession of the stars
2281,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Crosses the night, and on their tattered wings,"
2282,HYMN TO ZEUS,"Above the forest, cry the loud night-jars,"
2283,HYMN TO ZEUS,"We'll hunt the stag upon the mountain-side,"
2284,HYMN TO ZEUS,Slipping like light between the shadow bars
2285,HYMN TO ZEUS,'Til burst of dawn makes every distance wide.

2852,AN OLD DESIRE,"And all the night a sweet-voiced one,"

3729,THE DEAD KINGS,"At Rosnaree, where I was dreaming."
3730,THE DEAD KINGS,"A few stars glimmered through the morn,"
3731,THE DEAD KINGS,And down the thorn the dews were streaming.
3732,THE DEAD KINGS,
3733,THE DEAD KINGS,And every dead king had a story
3734,THE DEAD KINGS,"Of ancient glory, sweetly told."
3735,THE DEAD KINGS,"It was too early for the lark,"
3736,THE DEAD KINGS,But the starry dark had tints of gold.
3737,THE DEAD KINGS,
3738,THE DEAD KINGS,I listened to the sorrows three
3739,THE DEAD KINGS,Of that Eirë passed into song.
3740,THE DEAD KINGS,"A cock crowed near a hazel croft,"
3741,THE DEAD KINGS,And up aloft dim larks winged strong.
3742,THE DEAD KINGS,
3743,THE DEAD KINGS,"And I, too, told the kings a story"
3744,THE DEAD KINGS,"Of later glory, her fourth sorrow:"
3745,THE DEAD KINGS,There was a sound like moving shields
3746,THE DEAD KINGS,In high green fields and the lowland furrow.
3747,THE DEAD KINGS,
3748,THE DEAD KINGS,"And one said: ""We who yet are kings"
3749,THE DEAD KINGS,"Have heard these things lamenting inly."""
3750,THE DEAD KINGS,Sweet music flowed from many a bill
3751,THE DEAD KINGS,And on the hill the morn stood queenly.
3752,THE DEAD KINGS,
3753,THE DEAD KINGS,"And one said: ""Over is the singing,"
3754,THE DEAD KINGS,"And bell bough ringing, whence we come;"
3755,THE DEAD KINGS,"With heavy hearts we'll tread the shadows,"
3756,THE DEAD KINGS,"In honey meadows birds are dumb."""
3757,THE DEAD KINGS,
3758,THE DEAD KINGS,"And one said: ""Since the poets perished"
3759,THE DEAD KINGS,"And all they cherished in the way,"
3760,THE DEAD KINGS,"Their thoughts unsung, like petal showers"
3761,THE DEAD KINGS,"Inflame the hours of blue and gray."""
3762,THE DEAD KINGS,
3763,THE DEAD KINGS,"And one said: ""A loud tramp of men"
3764,THE DEAD KINGS,"We'll hear again at Rosnaree."""
3765,THE DEAD KINGS,A bomb burst near me where I lay.

4177,THE LANAWN SHEE,"The wine shall spill, and vacant places"
4178,THE LANAWN SHEE,Be given over to the new
4179,THE LANAWN SHEE,As love untrue keeps changing faces.
4180,THE LANAWN SHEE,
4181,THE LANAWN SHEE,"""And I must wander with my song"
4182,THE LANAWN SHEE,"Far from the young till Love returning,"
4183,THE LANAWN SHEE,Brings me the beautiful reward
4184,THE LANAWN SHEE,"Of some heart stirred by my long yearning."")"
4185,THE LANAWN SHEE,
4186,THE LANAWN SHEE,"Friend, have you heard a bird lament"
4187,THE LANAWN SHEE,When sleet is sent for April weather?
4188,THE LANAWN SHEE,"As beautiful she told her grief,"
4189,THE LANAWN SHEE,As down through leaf and flower I led her.
4190,THE LANAWN SHEE,
4191,THE LANAWN SHEE,"And friend, could I remain unstirred"
4192,THE LANAWN SHEE,Without a word for such a sorrow?
4193,THE LANAWN SHEE,"Say, can the lark forget the cloud"
4194,THE LANAWN SHEE,When poppies shroud the seeded furrow?
4195,THE LANAWN SHEE,
4196,THE LANAWN SHEE,Like a poor widow whose late grief
4197,THE LANAWN SHEE,"Seeks for relief in lonely byeways,"
4198,THE LANAWN SHEE,"The moon, companionless and dim,"
4199,THE LANAWN SHEE,Took her dull rim through starless highways.
4200,THE LANAWN SHEE,
4201,THE LANAWN SHEE,I was too weak with dreams to feel
4202,THE LANAWN SHEE,"Enchantment steal with guilt upon me,"
4203,THE LANAWN SHEE,"She slipped, a flower upon the wind,"
4204,THE LANAWN SHEE,And laughed to find how she had won me.
4205,THE LANAWN SHEE,
4206,THE LANAWN SHEE,"From hill to hill, from land to land,"
4207,THE LANAWN SHEE,"Her lovely hand is beckoning for me,"
4208,THE LANAWN SHEE,"I follow on through dangerous zones,"
4209,THE LANAWN SHEE,Cross dead men's bones and oceans stormy.
4210,THE LANAWN SHEE,
4211,THE LANAWN SHEE,Some day I know she'll wait at last
4212,THE LANAWN SHEE,"And lock me fast in white embraces,"
4213,THE LANAWN SHEE,And down mysterious ways of love
4214,THE LANAWN SHEE,We two shall move to fairy places.
