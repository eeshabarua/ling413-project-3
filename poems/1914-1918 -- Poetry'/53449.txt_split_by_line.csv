37,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,How Rifleman Brown Came to Valhalla
38,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,
39,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,By GILBERT FRANKAU
40,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,
41,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,
42,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"To the lower Hall of Valhalla, to the heroes of no renown,"
43,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"Relieved from his spell at the listening-post, came Rifleman Joseph Brown."
44,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"With never a rent in his khaki, nor smear of blood on his face,"
45,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,He flung his pack from his shoulders and made for an empty place.
46,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,The Killer-men of Valhalla looked up from the banquet board
47,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"At the unfouled breech of his rifle, at the unfleshed point of his sword,"
48,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"And the unsung dead of the trenches, the kings who have never a crown,"
49,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,Demanded his pass to Valhalla from Rifleman Joseph Brown.
50,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"“_Who comes, unhit, to the party?_” A one-legged Corporal spoke,"
51,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,And the gashed heads nodded approval through the rings of the Endless
52,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,Smoke.
53,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,“_Who comes for the beer and the Woodbines of the never-closed Canteen_
54,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,_With the barrack shine on his bayonet and a full-charged magazine?_”
55,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"Then Rifleman Brown looked round him at the nameless men of The Line,"
56,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"At the wounds of the shell and the bullet, at the burns of the bomb"
57,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,and the mine;
58,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"At the khaki, virgin of medals but crimson-clotted of blood;"
59,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,At the ankle-boots and the puttees caked stiff with the Flanders mud;
60,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"At the myriad short Lee-Enfields that crowded the rifle rack,"
61,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,Each with its blade to the sword-boss brown and its muzzle powder-black.
62,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"And Rifleman Brown said never a word, but he felt in the soul of his soul"
63,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,His right to the beer of the lower Hall though he came to drink of
64,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,it whole;
65,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"His right to the fags of the free Canteen, to a seat at the banquet board,"
66,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,Though he came to the men who had killed their man with an unfleshed point
67,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,to his sword.
68,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"“_Who speaks for the stranger riflemen, O boys of the free Canteen?_"
69,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,_Who passes the chap with the unmaimed limbs and the kit that is far
70,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,too clean?_”
71,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"The gashed heads eyed him above their beers, the gashed lips sucked at"
72,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,their smoke;
73,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"There were three at the board of his own platoon, but not a man of"
74,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,them spoke.
75,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"His mouth was mad for the tankard froth and the biting whiff of a fag,"
76,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,But he knew that he might not speak for himself to the dead men who do not
77,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,brag.
78,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"A gun butt crashed on the portals, a man came staggering in;"
79,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,His head was cleft with a great red wound from the temple bone to
80,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"the chin,"
81,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,His blade was dyed to the bayonet boss with the clots that were scarcely
82,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"dry,"
83,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"And he cried to the men who had killed their man, “Who passes the"
84,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,rifleman? I!
85,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"By the four I slew and the shell I stopped, if my feet be not too late,"
86,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,I speak the word for Rifleman Brown that a chap may speak for his
87,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,mate!”
88,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"The dead of lower Valhalla, the heroes of dumb renown,"
89,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,They pricked up their ears to a tale of the earth as they set their
90,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,tankards down.
91,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"“We were both on sentry this morning, when the General happened along."
92,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"He asked us our job in a gas attack. Joe told him, ‘Beat on the gong.’"
93,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,‘What else?’
94,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"‘Nothing else, sir,’ Joe answered."
95,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"‘Good God, man,’ our General said,"
96,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,‘By the time you’d beaten that bloodstained gong the chances are you’d be
97,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,dead.
98,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"You’d put on your gas helmet, blast you, and you’d damn well"
99,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,put it on _first_!’
100,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"And Joe stood dumb to attention, and wondered why he’d been cursed.”"
101,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"The gashed heads turned to the Rifleman, and now it seemed that they knew"
102,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,Why the face that had never a smear of blood was stained to the
103,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,jawbones blue.
104,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,“It was black to-night in the trenches.” The scarred heads craned
105,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"to the voice,"
106,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,As the man with the blood-red bayonet spoke up for the mate of his choice.
107,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"“You know what it’s like in the listening-post, with the very candles"
108,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"aflare,"
109,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"Their bullets smacking the sandbags, our Vickers combing your hair;"
110,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"How your ears and your eyes get jumpy, till each known tuft that you scan"
111,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,Moves and crawls in the shadows till you’d almost swear it was man.
112,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,You know how you peer and snuff at the night when the Northeast gas winds
113,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,blow.”
114,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"“_By the One who made us and maimed us_,” quoth lower Valhalla,"
115,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,“_we know!_”
116,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"“He was forty yards from the Bosches when, sudden as Hell, there came"
117,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"The crash of a dozen machine guns, the orange spurts of their flame,"
118,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,And Joe stood up in the whistling spray to try and fathom their game.
119,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"Sudden their guns cease firing, sudden his nostrils sniff"
120,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"The sickening reek of the rotten pears, the death that kills with a whiff."
121,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"Sniffs, and spots what their game is, and bangs on his cartridge case,"
122,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,With the gas cloud’s teeth in his windpipe and the gas cloud’s
123,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,claws on his face.
124,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,We heard his gong in our dugout--he only whacked on it twice--
125,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,We whipped our gas bags over our heads and tucked them down in a trice.
126,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,For the gas would have got us as sure as God if he’d taken the
127,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,Staff’s advice!”
128,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,His head was cleft with a great red wound from the chin to the
129,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"temple bone,"
130,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"But his voice was as clear as a sounding gong, “I’ll be damned"
131,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"if I’ll drink alone,"
132,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"Not even in lower Valhalla! Is he free of the free Canteen,"
133,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,My mate who comes with the unfleshed point and the full-charged magazine?”
134,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"The gashed heads rose at the Rifleman o’er the rings of the Endless Smoke,"
135,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"And loud as the roar of a thousand guns Valhalla’s answer broke,"
136,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,And loud as the crash of a thousand shells their tankards clashed
137,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,on the board:
138,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"“_He is free of the mess of the Killer-men, your mate of the"
139,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"unfleshed sword,_"
140,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"_For we know the worth of the thing he did, as we know the speed"
141,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,of the death_
142,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,_Which catches its man by the back of the throat and gives him
143,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,water for breath;_
144,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"_As we know how the hand at the helmet cloth may tarry seconds too long,_"
145,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,_When the very life of the front-line trench is staked on the
146,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,beat of a gong._
147,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"_By the four you slew, by the case he smote, by the red gas cloud and the"
148,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"green,_"
149,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,_We pass your mate for the Endless Smoke and the beer of the
150,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,free Canteen._”
151,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"In the lower hall of Valhalla, with the heroes of no renown,"
152,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"With our nameless dead of the Marne and the Aisne, of Mons and"
153,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"of Wipers town,"
154,FEDERAL PRINTING COMPANY,"With the men who killed ere they died for us, sits Rifleman Joseph Brown."
