125,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Men of the Twenty-first,"
126,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Up by the Chalk Pit Wood,"
127,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Weak from our wounds and our thirst,"
128,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,Wanting our sleep and our food
129,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,After a day and a night.
130,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,God! shall I ever forget?
131,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Beaten and broke in the fight,"
132,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"But sticking it, sticking it yet,"
133,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Trying to hold the line,"
134,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,Fainting and spent and done;
135,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Always the thud and the whine,"
136,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,Always the yell of the Hun.
137,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Northumberland, Lancaster, York,"
138,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Durham and Somerset,"
139,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Fighting alone, worn to the bone,"

141,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,
142,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Never a message of hope,"
143,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Never a word of cheer,"
144,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Fronting Hill 70's shell-swept slope,"
145,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"With the dull, dead plain in our rear;"
146,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Always the shriek of the shell,"
147,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Always the roar of the burst,"
148,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Always the tortures of Hell,"
149,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,As waiting and wincing we cursed
150,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Our luck, the guns, and the Boche."
151,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"When our Corporal shouted ""Stand to!"""
152,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"And I hear some one cry, ""Clear the front for the Guards!""--"
153,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,And the Guards came through.
154,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,
155,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Our throats they were parched and hot,"
156,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"But, Lord! if you'd heard the cheer,"
157,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Irish, Welsh and Scot,"
158,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,Coldstream and Grenadier--
159,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Two Brigades, if you please,"
160,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,Dressing as straight as a hem.
161,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"We, we were down on our knees,"
162,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Praying for us and for them,"
163,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Praying with tear-wet cheek,"
164,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,Praying with outstretched hand.
165,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Lord! I could speak for a week,"
166,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,But how could you understand?
167,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,How could your cheeks be wet?
168,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,Such feelin's don't come to you;
169,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,But how can me or my mates forget
170,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,How the Guards came through?
171,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,
172,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"""Five yards left extend!"""
173,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"It passed from rank to rank,"
174,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"And line after line, with never a bend,"
175,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,And a touch of the London swank.
176,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"A trifle of swank and dash,"
177,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Cool as a home parade,"
178,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Twinkle, glitter and flash,"
179,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Flinching never a shade,"
180,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"With the shrapnel right in their face,"
181,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Doing their Hyde Park stunt,"
182,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Swinging along at an easy pace,"
183,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"Arms at the trail, eyes front."
184,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,Man! it was great to see!
185,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,Man! it was great to do!
186,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"It's a cot, and a hospital ward for me,"
187,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,"But I'll tell them in Blighty wherever I be,"

196,VICTRIX,How was it then with England?
197,VICTRIX,"Her faith was true to her plighted word,"
198,VICTRIX,"Her strong hand closed on her blunted sword,"
199,VICTRIX,"Her heart rose high to the foeman's hate,"
200,VICTRIX,She walked with God on the hills of Fate--
201,VICTRIX,And all was well with England.
202,VICTRIX,
203,VICTRIX,How was it then with England?
204,VICTRIX,"Her soul was wrung with loss and pain,"
205,VICTRIX,"Her face was grey with her heart's-blood drain,"
206,VICTRIX,"But her falcon eyes were hard and bright,"
207,VICTRIX,Austere and cold as an ice-cave's light--
208,VICTRIX,And all was well with England.
209,VICTRIX,
210,VICTRIX,How was it then with England?
211,VICTRIX,"Little she said to foe or friend,"
212,VICTRIX,"True, heart true, to the uttermost end,"
213,VICTRIX,"Her passion cry was the scathe she wrought,"
214,VICTRIX,In flame and steel she voiced her thought--
215,VICTRIX,And all was well with England.
216,VICTRIX,
217,VICTRIX,How was it then with England?
218,VICTRIX,"With drooping sword and bended head,"
219,VICTRIX,"She turned apart and mourned her dead,"
220,VICTRIX,"Sad sky above, sad earth beneath,"
221,VICTRIX,She walked with God in the Vale of Death--
222,VICTRIX,"Ah, woe the day for England!"
223,VICTRIX,
224,VICTRIX,How is it now with England?
225,VICTRIX,She sees upon her mist-girt path
226,VICTRIX,Dim drifting shapes of fear and wrath.
227,VICTRIX,Hold high the heart! Bend low the knee!
228,VICTRIX,"She has been guided, and will be--"
229,VICTRIX,And all is well with England.

236,THOSE OTHERS,
237,THOSE OTHERS,Where are those others?--the men who stood
238,THOSE OTHERS,"In the first wild spate of the German flood,"
239,THOSE OTHERS,And paid full price with their heart's best blood
240,THOSE OTHERS,For the saving of you and me:
241,THOSE OTHERS,"French's Contemptibles, haggard and lean,"
242,THOSE OTHERS,"Allenby's lads of the cavalry screen,"
243,THOSE OTHERS,"Gunners who fell in Battery L,"
244,THOSE OTHERS,And Guardsmen of Landrecies?
245,THOSE OTHERS,
246,THOSE OTHERS,"Where are those others who fought and fell,"
247,THOSE OTHERS,"Outmanned, outgunned and scant of shell,"
248,THOSE OTHERS,"On the deadly curve of the Ypres hell,"
249,THOSE OTHERS,Barring the coast to the last?
250,THOSE OTHERS,"Where are our laddies who died out there,"
251,THOSE OTHERS,"From Poelcapelle to Festubert,"
252,THOSE OTHERS,When the days grew short and the poplars bare
253,THOSE OTHERS,In the cold November blast?
254,THOSE OTHERS,
255,THOSE OTHERS,"For us their toil and for us their pain,"
256,THOSE OTHERS,"The sordid ditch in the sodden plain,"
257,THOSE OTHERS,"The Flemish fog and the driving rain,"
258,THOSE OTHERS,The cold that cramped and froze;
259,THOSE OTHERS,"The weary night, the chill bleak day,"
260,THOSE OTHERS,"When earth was dark and sky was grey,"
261,THOSE OTHERS,And the ragged weeds in the dripping clay
262,THOSE OTHERS,Were all God's world to those.
263,THOSE OTHERS,
264,THOSE OTHERS,"Where are those others in this glad time,"
265,THOSE OTHERS,"When the standards wave and the joy-bells chime,"
266,THOSE OTHERS,And London stands with outstretched hands
267,THOSE OTHERS,Waving her children in?
268,THOSE OTHERS,Athwart our joy still comes the thought
269,THOSE OTHERS,"Of the dear dead boys, whose lives have bought"
270,THOSE OTHERS,All that sweet victory has brought
271,THOSE OTHERS,To us who lived to win.
272,THOSE OTHERS,
273,THOSE OTHERS,"To each his dreams, and mine to me,"
274,THOSE OTHERS,But as the shadows fall I see
275,THOSE OTHERS,That ever-glorious company--
276,THOSE OTHERS,The men who bide out there.
277,THOSE OTHERS,"Rifleman, Highlander, Fusilier,"
278,THOSE OTHERS,"Airman and Sapper and Grenadier,"
279,THOSE OTHERS,"With flaunting banner and wave and cheer,"
280,THOSE OTHERS,They flow through the darkening air.
281,THOSE OTHERS,
282,THOSE OTHERS,"And yours are there, and so are mine,"
283,THOSE OTHERS,"Rank upon rank and line on line,"
284,THOSE OTHERS,"With smiling lips and eyes that shine,"
285,THOSE OTHERS,And bearing proud and high.
286,THOSE OTHERS,"Past they go with their measured tread,"
287,THOSE OTHERS,"These are the victors, these--the dead!"
288,THOSE OTHERS,"Ah, sink the knee and bare the head"
289,THOSE OTHERS,As the hallowed host goes by!

331,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,
332,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,
333,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,Light green of grass and richer green of bush
334,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,Slope upwards to the darkest green of fir.
335,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,How still! How deathly still! And yet the hush
336,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"Shivers and trembles with some subtle stir,"
337,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"Some far-off throbbing like a muffled drum,"
338,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"Beaten in broken rhythm oversea,"
339,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,To play the last funereal march of some
340,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,Who die to-day that Europe may be free.
341,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,
342,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"The deep-blue heaven, curving from the green,"
343,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,Spans with its shimmering arch the flowery zone;
344,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"In all God's earth there is no gentler scene,"
345,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,And yet I hear that awesome monotone.
346,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"Above the circling midge's piping shrill,"
347,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"And the long droning of the questing bee,"
348,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"Above all sultry summer sounds, it still"
349,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,Mutters its ceaseless menaces to me.
350,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,
351,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"And as I listen, all the garden fair"
352,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"Darkens to plains of misery and death,"
353,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"And, looking past the roses, I see there"
354,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,Those sordid furrows with the rising breath
355,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,Of all things foul and black. My heart is hot
356,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"Within me as I view it, and I cry,"
357,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"""Better the misery of these men's lot"
358,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"Than all the peace that comes to such as I!"""
359,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,
360,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,And strange that in the pauses of the sound
361,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"I hear the children's laughter as they roam,"
362,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"And then their mother calls, and all around"
363,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,Rise up the gentle murmurs of a home.
364,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"But still I gaze afar, and at the sight"
365,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"My whole soul softens to its heart-felt prayer,"
366,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"""Spirit of Justice, Thou for whom they fight,"
367,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"Ah, turn in mercy to our lads out there!"
368,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,
369,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"""The froward peoples have deserved Thy wrath,"
370,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"And on them is the Judgment as of old,"
371,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,But if they wandered from the hallowed path
372,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,Yet is their retribution manifold.
373,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"Behold all Europe writhing on the rack,"
374,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,The sins of fathers grinding down the sons!
375,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,"How long, O Lord?"" He sends no answer back,"
376,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,But still I hear the mutter of the guns.

404,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",You held council at your quarters when the budding Alexanders
405,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",And the Pickel-haubed Cæsars gave their reasons.
406,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",Was there one amongst that bristle-headed circle of commanders
407,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",Ever ventured the opinion that a little town of Flanders
408,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",Would hold you pounded here through all the seasons?
409,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
410,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","You all clasped hands upon it. You would break the British line,"
411,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","You would smash a road to westward with your host,"
412,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",The howitzers should thunder and the Uhlan lances shine
413,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Till Calais heard the blaring of the distant ""Wacht am Rhein,"""
414,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",As you topped the grassy uplands of the coast.
415,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Said the Graf von Feuer-Essen, ""It's a fact beyond discussion,"
416,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",That man to man we can outfight the foe.
417,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","There is valour in the French, there is patience in the Russian,"
418,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","But blend all war-like virtues and you get the lordly Prussian,"""
419,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","And the bristle-headed murmured, ""_Das ist so._"""
420,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
421,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","""And the British,"" cried another, ""they are mercenary cattle,"
422,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Without one noble impulse of the soul,"
423,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Degenerate and drunken; if the dollars chink and rattle,"
424,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","'Tis the only sort of music that will call them to the battle."""
425,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","And all the bristle-headed cried, ""_Ja wohl!_"""
426,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","And so next day your battle rolled across the Menin Plain,"
427,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",Where Capper's men stood lonely to your wrath.
428,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","You broke him, and you broke him, but you broke him all in vain,"
429,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","For he and his contemptibles kept closing up again,"
430,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",And the khaki bar was still across your path.
431,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
432,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","And on the day when Gheluvelt lay smoking in the sun,"
433,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","When Von Deimling stormed so hotly in the van,"
434,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","You smiled as Haig reeled backwards and you thought him on the run,"
435,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","But, alas for dreams that vanish, for before the day was done"
436,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","It was you, my Lord of Würtemberg, that ran."
437,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
438,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","A dreary day was that--but another came, more dreary,"
439,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","When the Guard from Arras led your fierce attacks,"
440,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Spruce and splendid in the morning were the Potsdam Grenadiere,"
441,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","But not so spruce that evening when they staggered spent and weary,"
442,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",With those cursed British storming at their backs.
443,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
444,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","You knew--your spies had told you--that the ranks were scant and thin,"
445,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","That the guns were short of shell and very few,"
446,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","By all Bernhardi's maxims you were surely bound to win,"
447,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","There's the open town before you. Haste, my Lord, and enter in,"
448,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",Or the War-Lord may have telegrams for you.
449,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Then came the rainy winter, when the price was ever dearer,"
450,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Every time you neared the prize of which you dreamed,"
451,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Each day the Belfry faced you but you never brought it nearer,"
452,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",Each night you saw it clearly but you never saw it clearer.
453,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Ah, what a weary time it must have seemed!"
454,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
455,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","At last there came the Easter when you loosed the coward gases,"
456,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",Surely you have got the rascals now!
457,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",You could see them spent and choking as you watched them thro' your
458,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","glasses,"
459,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Yes, they choke, but never waver, and again the moment passes"
460,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",Without one leaf of laurel for your brow.
461,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
462,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Then at Hooge you had them helpless, for their guns were one to ten,"
463,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","And you blasted trench and traverse at your will,"
464,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","You had them dead and buried, but they still sprang up again."
465,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","""_Donnerwetter!_"" cried your Lordship, ""_Donnerwetter!_"" cried your men,"
466,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",For their very ghosts were guarding Ypres still.
467,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
468,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Active, Guards, Reserve--men of every corps and name"
469,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","That the bugles of the War-Lord muster in,"
470,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Each in turn you tried them, but the story was the same;"
471,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Play it how you would, my Lord, you never won the game,"
472,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","No, never in a twelvemonth did you win."
473,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
474,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","A year, my Lord of Würtemberg--a year, or nearly so,"
475,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",Since first you faced the British _vis-à-vis_!
476,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Your learned Commandanten are the men who ought to know,"
477,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","But to ordinary mortals it would seem a trifle slow,"
478,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",If you really mean to travel to the sea.
479,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
480,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","If you cannot _straf_ the British, since they _strafen_ you so well,"
481,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","You can safely smash the town that lies so near,"
482,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","So it's down with arch and buttress, down with belfry and with bell,"
483,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",And it's _hoch_ the seven-seven that can drop the petrol shell
484,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",On the shrines that pious hands have loved to rear!
485,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
486,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","Fair Ypres was a relic of the soul of other days,"
487,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","A poet's dream, a wanderer's delight,"
488,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",We will keep it as a symbol of your brute Teutonic ways
489,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",That millions yet unborn may come and curse you as they gaze
490,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",At this token of your impotence and spite.
491,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",
492,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","For shame, my Lord of Würtemberg! Across the Flemish Fen"
493,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",See where the little army calls you.
494,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","It's just the old familiar line of fifty thousand men,"
495,"SEPTEMBER, 1915","They've beat you once or twice, my Lord, but venture it again,"

628,SEPTEMBER 1918,"A coon-song gently strikes the ear,"
629,SEPTEMBER 1918,A flapper giggles in the shade.
630,SEPTEMBER 1918,There where the in-turned lantern gleams
631,SEPTEMBER 1918,It shines on khaki and on brass;
632,SEPTEMBER 1918,Across its yellow slanting beams
633,SEPTEMBER 1918,The arm-locked lovers slowly pass.
634,SEPTEMBER 1918,
635,SEPTEMBER 1918,Out in the darkness one far light
636,SEPTEMBER 1918,"Throbs like a pulse, and fades away--"
637,SEPTEMBER 1918,"Some signal on the guarded Wight,"
638,SEPTEMBER 1918,From Helen's Point to Bembridge Bay.

788,SEPTEMBER 1918,Now McFarlane never utters
789,SEPTEMBER 1918,"Any talk of bills or bullion,"
790,SEPTEMBER 1918,But continually mutters
791,SEPTEMBER 1918,Texts from Cyril or Tertullian.
792,SEPTEMBER 1918,
793,SEPTEMBER 1918,"As to Ainslie, he's not caring"
794,SEPTEMBER 1918,"How the new-cut collar lies,"
795,SEPTEMBER 1918,And has been detected wearing
796,SEPTEMBER 1918,Dinner-jackets with white ties.
797,SEPTEMBER 1918,
798,SEPTEMBER 1918,"Waters, who had never thought"
799,SEPTEMBER 1918,"In his life of others' needs,"
800,SEPTEMBER 1918,Has most generously bought
801,SEPTEMBER 1918,A nursing-home for invalids.
802,SEPTEMBER 1918,
803,SEPTEMBER 1918,"And the lady--ah, the lady!"
804,SEPTEMBER 1918,"She has turned from paths of sin,"
805,SEPTEMBER 1918,And her husband's face so shady
806,SEPTEMBER 1918,Now is brightened by a grin.
807,SEPTEMBER 1918,
808,SEPTEMBER 1918,So misfortunes of to-day
809,SEPTEMBER 1918,"Are the blessings of to-morrow,"
810,SEPTEMBER 1918,And the wisest cannot say
811,SEPTEMBER 1918,What is joy and what is sorrow.
812,SEPTEMBER 1918,
813,SEPTEMBER 1918,If your soul is arable
814,SEPTEMBER 1918,"You can start this seed within it,"

823,THE BIGOT,
824,THE BIGOT,The foolish Roman fondly thought
825,THE BIGOT,"That gods must be the same to all,"
826,THE BIGOT,Each alien idol might be brought
827,THE BIGOT,Within their broad Pantheon Hall.
828,THE BIGOT,The vision of a jealous Jove
829,THE BIGOT,Was far above their feeble ken;
830,THE BIGOT,"They had no Lord who gave them love,"
831,THE BIGOT,But scowled upon all other men.
832,THE BIGOT,
833,THE BIGOT,"But in our dispensation bright,"
834,THE BIGOT,What noble progress have we made!
835,THE BIGOT,"We know that we are in the light,"
836,THE BIGOT,And outer races in the shade.
837,THE BIGOT,Our kindly creed ensures us this--
838,THE BIGOT,That Turk and infidel and Jew
839,THE BIGOT,Are safely banished from the bliss
840,THE BIGOT,That's guaranteed to me and you.
841,THE BIGOT,
842,THE BIGOT,The Roman mother understood
843,THE BIGOT,"That, if the babe upon her breast"
844,THE BIGOT,"Untimely died, the gods were good,"
845,THE BIGOT,And the child's welfare manifest.
846,THE BIGOT,With tender guides the soul would go
847,THE BIGOT,"And there, in some Elysian bower,"
848,THE BIGOT,The tiny bud plucked here below
849,THE BIGOT,Would ripen to the perfect flower.
850,THE BIGOT,
851,THE BIGOT,Poor simpleton! Our faith makes plain
852,THE BIGOT,"That, if no blest baptismal word"
853,THE BIGOT,"Has cleared the babe, it bears the stain"
854,THE BIGOT,Which faithless Adam had incurred.
855,THE BIGOT,How philosophical an aim!
856,THE BIGOT,How wise and well-conceived a plan
857,THE BIGOT,Which holds the new-born babe to blame
858,THE BIGOT,For all the sins of early man!
859,THE BIGOT,
860,THE BIGOT,"Nay, speak not of its tender grace,"
861,THE BIGOT,But hearken to our dogma wise:
862,THE BIGOT,"Guilt lies behind that dimpled face,"
863,THE BIGOT,And sin looks out from gentle eyes.
864,THE BIGOT,"Quick, quick, the water and the bowl!"
865,THE BIGOT,Quick with the words that lift the load!
866,THE BIGOT,"Oh, hasten, ere that tiny soul"
867,THE BIGOT,Shall pay the debt old Adam owed!
868,THE BIGOT,
869,THE BIGOT,The Roman thought the souls that erred
870,THE BIGOT,"Would linger in some nether gloom,"
871,THE BIGOT,"But somewhere, sometime, would be spared"
872,THE BIGOT,To find some peace beyond the tomb.
873,THE BIGOT,"In those dark halls, enshadowed, vast,"
874,THE BIGOT,"They flitted ever, sad and thin,"
875,THE BIGOT,Mourning the unforgotten past
876,THE BIGOT,Until they shed the taint of sin.
877,THE BIGOT,
878,THE BIGOT,And Pluto brooded over all
879,THE BIGOT,"Within that land of night and fear,"
880,THE BIGOT,"Enthroned in some dark Judgment Hall,"
881,THE BIGOT,"A god himself, reserved, austere."
882,THE BIGOT,How thin and colourless and tame!
883,THE BIGOT,"Compare our nobler scheme with it,"
884,THE BIGOT,"The howling souls, the leaping flame,"
885,THE BIGOT,And all the tortures of the pit!
886,THE BIGOT,
887,THE BIGOT,Foolish half-hearted Roman hell!
888,THE BIGOT,To us is left the higher thought
889,THE BIGOT,Of that eternal torture cell
890,THE BIGOT,Whereto the sinner shall be brought.
891,THE BIGOT,Out with the thought that God could share
892,THE BIGOT,"Our weak relenting pity sense,"
893,THE BIGOT,Or ever condescend to spare
894,THE BIGOT,The wretch who gave Him just offence!
895,THE BIGOT,
896,THE BIGOT,'Tis just ten thousand years ago
897,THE BIGOT,"Since the vile sinner left his clay,"
898,THE BIGOT,"And yet no pity can he know,"
899,THE BIGOT,For as he lies in hell to-day
900,THE BIGOT,So when ten thousand years have run
901,THE BIGOT,Still shall he lie in endless night.
902,THE BIGOT,O God of Love! O Holy One!
903,THE BIGOT,Have we not read Thy ways aright?
904,THE BIGOT,
905,THE BIGOT,"The godly man in heaven shall dwell,"
906,THE BIGOT,"And live in joy before the throne,"
907,THE BIGOT,Though somewhere down in nether hell
908,THE BIGOT,His wife or children writhe and groan.
909,THE BIGOT,From his bright Empyrean height
910,THE BIGOT,He sees the reek from that abyss--
911,THE BIGOT,What Pagan ever dreamed a sight
912,THE BIGOT,So holy and sublime as this!
913,THE BIGOT,
914,THE BIGOT,Poor foolish folk! Had they begun
915,THE BIGOT,"To weigh the myths that they professed,"
916,THE BIGOT,One hour of reason and each one
917,THE BIGOT,Would surely stand a fraud confessed.
918,THE BIGOT,Pretending to believe each deed
919,THE BIGOT,"Of Theseus or of Hercules,"
920,THE BIGOT,"With fairy tales of Ganymede,"
921,THE BIGOT,And gods of rocks and gods of trees!
922,THE BIGOT,
923,THE BIGOT,"No, no, had they our purer light"
924,THE BIGOT,They would have learned some saner tale
925,THE BIGOT,"Of Balaam's ass, or Samson's might,"
926,THE BIGOT,"Or prophet Jonah and his whale,"
927,THE BIGOT,"Of talking serpents and their ways,"
928,THE BIGOT,"Through which our foolish parents strayed,"
929,THE BIGOT,And how there passed three nights and days
930,THE BIGOT,Before the sun or moon was made!

934,THE BIGOT,"O Bigotry, you crowning sin!"
935,THE BIGOT,All evil that a man can do
936,THE BIGOT,"Has earthly bounds, nor can begin"
937,THE BIGOT,To match the mischief done by you--
938,THE BIGOT,"You, who would force the source of love"
939,THE BIGOT,"To play your small sectarian part,"
940,THE BIGOT,And mould the mercy from above
941,THE BIGOT,To fit your own contracted heart.

950,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,"When it shoots the last dark cañon to the Plains of Far-away,"
951,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,"But while its stream is running through the years that are to be,"
952,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,The mighty voice of Canada will ever call to me.

963,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,"I have crossed the Inland Ocean, lying golden in the sun,"
964,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,But the last and best and sweetest is the ride by hill and dale
965,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,With the packer and the packhorse on the Athabasca Trail.
966,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,
967,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,I'll dream again of fields of grain that stretch from sky to sky
968,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,"And the little prairie hamlets where the cars go roaring by,"
969,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,"Wooden hamlets as I saw them--noble cities still to be,"
970,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,To girdle stately Canada with gems from sea to sea.
971,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,"Mother of a mighty manhood, land of glamour and of hope,"
972,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,"From the eastward sea-swept islands to the sunny western slope,"
973,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,"Ever more my heart is with you, ever more till life shall fail"
974,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,I'll be out with pack and packer on the Athabasca Trail.
