39,PREFACE,"This book stands dedicated to one only of my friends, but there are many"
40,PREFACE,"others to whom I would willingly dedicate singly and in state, if that"
41,PREFACE,did not mean the writing of forty books of verse and dedications--a
42,PREFACE,terrible thing for all concerned.
43,PREFACE,
44,PREFACE,"So that, under the single name and sign of homage and affection, I would"
45,PREFACE,desire such readers as come to me to add also:
46,PREFACE,
47,PREFACE,To my father and mother; F. W. Harvey (also a Gloucestershire lad); Miss
48,PREFACE,"Marion Scott, whose criticism has been so useful, and she so kind, in"
49,PREFACE,spite of my continued refusal to alter a word of anything; the Vicar of
50,PREFACE,Twigworth; Herbert Howells (and this is not the last time you will hear
51,PREFACE,"of him); Mr. Hilaire Belloc, whose “Path to Rome” has been my trench"
52,PREFACE,"companion, with “The Spirit of Man”; Mr. Wilfred Gibson, author of"
53,PREFACE,"“Friends,” a great little book; many others also, including Shakespeare"
54,PREFACE,"and Bach, both friends of mine; and, last but not least, my comrades of"
55,PREFACE,"two platoons of the-/-[A] Gloucesters, who so often have wondered"
56,PREFACE,"whether I were crazy or not. Let them draw their own conclusions now,"
57,PREFACE,for the writing of this book it was that so distracted me.... This is a
58,PREFACE,"long list, and even now does not include old Mrs. Poyner, who was so"
59,PREFACE,"jolly and long-suffering, nor my boat _Dorothy_, now idle in the mud;"
60,PREFACE,though a poet sang of her full of glory at Framilode.
61,PREFACE,
62,PREFACE,[A] The publication of Battalion Nos. being strictly forbidden by
63,PREFACE,"the Military Authorities, we have to leave the identification of the"
64,PREFACE,"platoons referred to by Mr. Gurney to those whom it concerns.--S. & J.,"

66,LTD.,
67,LTD.,"Even as I write the list becomes fuller, farther extended, yet a soldier"
68,LTD.,"must face pain, and so it remains shorter by far than might be."
69,LTD.,
70,LTD.,"I fear that those who buy the book (or even borrow), to get information"
71,LTD.,about the Gloucesters will be disappointed. Most of the book is
72,LTD.,"concerned with a person named Myself, and the rest with my county,"
73,LTD.,"Gloucester, that whether I die or live stays always with me--being in"
74,LTD.,"itself so beautiful, so full of memories; whose people are so good to be"
75,LTD.,"friends with, so easy-going and so frank."
76,LTD.,
77,LTD.,Some of the afore-mentioned people I have never had good fortune enough
78,LTD.,"to meet in the flesh, but that was not my fault. I hope they will"
79,LTD.,"forgive my using their names without permission. Ah, would they only"
80,LTD.,"retaliate in kind! That is, however, not likely, as I never was famous,"
81,LTD.,and a Common Private makes but little show.
82,LTD.,
83,LTD.,"All these verses were written in France, and in sound of the guns, save"
84,LTD.,only two or three earlier pieces. This should be reason enough to excuse
85,LTD.,"any roughness in the technique. If more reason is required, people of"
86,LTD.,"home, and most of all, people of Gloucester, may well be indulgent to"
87,LTD.,"one who thought of them so often, and whose images of beauty in the mind"
88,LTD.,"were always of Gloucester, county of Cotswold and Severn, and a plain"
89,LTD.,"rich, blossomy, and sweet of airs--as the wise Romans knew, who made"
90,LTD.,"their homes in exile by the brown river, watching the further bank for"
91,LTD.,signs of war.
