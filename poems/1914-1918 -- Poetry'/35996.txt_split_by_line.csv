137,CLOUDS                     39,"Sometimes I fly at dawn above the sea,"
138,CLOUDS                     39,"Where, underneath, the restless waters flow--"
139,CLOUDS                     39,"Silver, and cold, and slow."
140,CLOUDS                     39,"Dim in the East there burns a new-born sun,"
141,CLOUDS                     39,"Whose rosy gleams along the ripples run,"
142,CLOUDS                     39,"Save where the mist droops low,"
143,CLOUDS                     39,Hiding the level loneliness from me.
144,CLOUDS                     39,
145,CLOUDS                     39,And now appears beneath the milk-white haze

147,CLOUDS                     39,"In clustered company,"
148,CLOUDS                     39,"And seem as they are yet fast bound by sleep,"
149,CLOUDS                     39,"Although the day has long begun to peep,"
150,CLOUDS                     39,"With red-inflam√®d eye,"
151,CLOUDS                     39,"Along the still, deserted ocean ways."
152,CLOUDS                     39,
153,CLOUDS                     39,"The fresh, cold wind of dawn blows on my face"
154,CLOUDS                     39,"As in the sun's raw heart I swiftly fly,"
155,CLOUDS                     39,And watch the seas glide by.
156,CLOUDS                     39,"Scarce human seem I, moving through the skies,"
157,CLOUDS                     39,And far removed from warlike enterprise--
158,CLOUDS                     39,Like some great gull on high
159,CLOUDS                     39,Whose white and gleaming wings beat on through space.
160,CLOUDS                     39,
161,CLOUDS                     39,"Then do I feel with God quite, quite alone,"
162,CLOUDS                     39,"High in the virgin morn, so white and still,"
163,CLOUDS                     39,And free from human ill:
164,CLOUDS                     39,My prayers transcend my feeble earth-bound plaints--
165,CLOUDS                     39,As though I sang among the happy Saints
166,CLOUDS                     39,With many a holy thrill--
167,CLOUDS                     39,As though the glowing sun were God's bright Throne.
168,CLOUDS                     39,
169,CLOUDS                     39,My flight is done. I cross the line of foam
170,CLOUDS                     39,"That breaks around a town of grey and red,"
171,CLOUDS                     39,Whose streets and squares lie dead
172,CLOUDS                     39,Beneath the silent dawn--then am I proud
173,CLOUDS                     39,That England's peace to guard I am allowed;--
174,CLOUDS                     39,"Then bow my humble head,"
175,CLOUDS                     39,In thanks to Him Who brings me safely home.

185,CLOUDS                     39,When heavy on my tired mind
186,CLOUDS                     39,"The world, and worldly things, do weigh,"
187,CLOUDS                     39,"And some sweet solace I would find,"
188,CLOUDS                     39,"Into the sky I love to stray,"
189,CLOUDS                     39,"And, all alone, to wander round"
190,CLOUDS                     39,In lone seclusion from the ground.
191,CLOUDS                     39,
192,CLOUDS                     39,Ah! Then what solitude is mine--
193,CLOUDS                     39,From grovelling mankind aloof!
194,CLOUDS                     39,Their road is but a thin-drawn line:
195,CLOUDS                     39,Their busy house a scarce-seen roof.
196,CLOUDS                     39,That little stain of red and brown
197,CLOUDS                     39,They boast about!--It is their town!
198,CLOUDS                     39,
199,CLOUDS                     39,How small their petty quarrels seem!
200,CLOUDS                     39,"Poor, crawling multitudes below;"
201,CLOUDS                     39,"Which, like the ants, in feverish stream"
202,CLOUDS                     39,From place to place move to and fro!
203,CLOUDS                     39,"Like ants they work: like ants they fight,"
204,CLOUDS                     39,Assuming blindly they are right.
205,CLOUDS                     39,
206,CLOUDS                     39,"Soon their existence I forget,"
207,CLOUDS                     39,In joy that on these flashing wings
208,CLOUDS                     39,I cleave the skies--O! let them fret--
209,CLOUDS                     39,Now know I why the skylark sings
210,CLOUDS                     39,Untrammelled in the boundless air--
211,CLOUDS                     39,For mine it is his bliss to share!
212,CLOUDS                     39,
213,CLOUDS                     39,"Now do I mount a billowy cloud,"

215,CLOUDS                     39,And with a seagull's skill endowed
216,CLOUDS                     39,"Circle, and wheel, and drop at will--"
217,CLOUDS                     39,"Above the villages asleep,"
218,CLOUDS                     39,"Above the valleys, shadowed deep,"
219,CLOUDS                     39,
220,CLOUDS                     39,Above the water-meadows green
221,CLOUDS                     39,"Whose streams, which intermingled flow,"
222,CLOUDS                     39,Like silver lattice-work are seen
223,CLOUDS                     39,A-gleam upon the plain below--
224,CLOUDS                     39,"Above the woods, whose naked trees"
225,CLOUDS                     39,Move new-born buds upon the breeze.
226,CLOUDS                     39,
227,CLOUDS                     39,And far away above the haze
228,CLOUDS                     39,"I see white mountain-summits rise,"
229,CLOUDS                     39,Whose snow with sunlight is ablaze
230,CLOUDS                     39,And shines against the distant skies.
231,CLOUDS                     39,Such thoughts those towering ranges bring
232,CLOUDS                     39,That I float on a-wondering!
233,CLOUDS                     39,
234,CLOUDS                     39,So do I love to travel on
235,CLOUDS                     39,"Through lonely skies, myself alone;"
236,CLOUDS                     39,For then the feverish fret is gone
237,CLOUDS                     39,Which on this earth I oft have known.
238,CLOUDS                     39,Kind is the God who lets me fly
239,CLOUDS                     39,In sweet seclusion through the sky!

251,CLOUDS                     39,In generous flood ...
252,CLOUDS                     39,This sun-drowsed day for me is darkest night.
253,CLOUDS                     39,"O! wreck of splintered wood and twisted wire,"
254,CLOUDS                     39,"What blind, unmeasured hatred you inspire"
255,CLOUDS                     39,Because yours was the power that life to end ...
256,CLOUDS                     39,"Of him, who was my friend!"
257,CLOUDS                     39,
258,CLOUDS                     39,"This morn we lay upon the grass,"
259,CLOUDS                     39,And watched the languid hours pass;
260,CLOUDS                     39,"A lark, deep in the sky's blue sea,"
261,CLOUDS                     39,Sang ecstasies to him and me.
262,CLOUDS                     39,
263,CLOUDS                     39,"And with the daisies did he play,"
264,CLOUDS                     39,"As on the waving grass we lay,"
265,CLOUDS                     39,And made a little daisy chain
266,CLOUDS                     39,To bring his childhood back again.
267,CLOUDS                     39,
268,CLOUDS                     39,And while he watched the clouds above
269,CLOUDS                     39,He drifted into thoughts of love.
270,CLOUDS                     39,"He said, ""I know why skylarks sing--"
271,CLOUDS                     39,"Because they love, and it is Spring."
272,CLOUDS                     39,
273,CLOUDS                     39,"And if I had a voice as they,"
274,CLOUDS                     39,"So would I sing this golden May,"
275,CLOUDS                     39,"Because I love, and loved am I,"
276,CLOUDS                     39,"And when I wander through the sky,"
277,CLOUDS                     39,
278,CLOUDS                     39,"I wish I had a skylark's voice,"
279,CLOUDS                     39,And with such singing could rejoice.
280,CLOUDS                     39,"Oh, happy, happy, are these days!"
281,CLOUDS                     39,"My heart is full of deep-felt praise,"
282,CLOUDS                     39,
283,CLOUDS                     39,And thanks to God who brings this bliss!
284,CLOUDS                     39,Oh! what a happiness is this--
285,CLOUDS                     39,To lie upon the grass and know
286,CLOUDS                     39,In two short days that I shall go
287,CLOUDS                     39,
288,CLOUDS                     39,"And see my Love's fair face again,"
289,CLOUDS                     39,"And wander in some flowery lane,"
290,CLOUDS                     39,"Forgetting all the world around,"
291,CLOUDS                     39,And only knowing I have found
292,CLOUDS                     39,
293,CLOUDS                     39,"A Spring enchantment, which is mine"
294,CLOUDS                     39,"Through God's sweet sympathy divine, ..."
295,CLOUDS                     39,"May these two days now swiftly pass!"""
296,CLOUDS                     39,He laughed upon the sunlit grass.
297,CLOUDS                     39,
298,CLOUDS                     39,"The days have passed, but passed, alas! how slow!"
299,CLOUDS                     39,See down the road a sad procession go!
300,CLOUDS                     39,Oh! hear the wailing music moan!
301,CLOUDS                     39,Why? Why such grief am I to know?
302,CLOUDS                     39,Dear God! I wish I were alone.
303,CLOUDS                     39,For by the grave a girl with streaming eyes
304,CLOUDS                     39,Doth make mine dim.
305,CLOUDS                     39,"While high among the sunny springtime skies,"
306,CLOUDS                     39,The larks still hymn.
307,CLOUDS                     39,
308,CLOUDS                     39,"_France, 1917._"
309,CLOUDS                     39,

311,CLOUDS                     39,
312,CLOUDS                     39,
313,CLOUDS                     39,_The Night Raid_
314,CLOUDS                     39,
315,CLOUDS                     39,
316,CLOUDS                     39,"Around me broods the dim, mysterious Night,"
317,CLOUDS                     39,Star-lit and still.
318,CLOUDS                     39,"No whisper comes across the Plain,"
319,CLOUDS                     39,"Asleep beneath the breezes light,"
320,CLOUDS                     39,Which scarcely stir the growing grain.
321,CLOUDS                     39,Slow chimes the quiet midnight hour
322,CLOUDS                     39,"In some unseen and distant tower,"
323,CLOUDS                     39,"While round me broods the vague, mysterious Night,"
324,CLOUDS                     39,"Star-lit, and cool, and still."
325,CLOUDS                     39,
326,CLOUDS                     39,And I must desecrate this silent time
327,CLOUDS                     39,Of drowsy dreams!
328,CLOUDS                     39,"On mighty wings towards the sky,"
329,CLOUDS                     39,"Towards the stars, I have to climb"
330,CLOUDS                     39,"And o'er the sleeping country fly,"
331,CLOUDS                     39,And such far-echoing clamour make
332,CLOUDS                     39,That all the villages must wake.
333,CLOUDS                     39,So must I desecrate this quiet time
334,CLOUDS                     39,Of soft and drowsy dreams!
335,CLOUDS                     39,
336,CLOUDS                     39,The hour comes ... soon must I say farewell
337,CLOUDS                     39,To this fair earth.
338,CLOUDS                     39,Then to my little room I go
339,CLOUDS                     39,Where I perhaps no more shall dwell.
340,CLOUDS                     39,Shall I return?--The Gods but know.
341,CLOUDS                     39,Perchance again I shall not sleep
342,CLOUDS                     39,On that white bed in silence deep.
343,CLOUDS                     39,For soon the hour comes to say farewell
344,CLOUDS                     39,"To this fair, friendly earth."
345,CLOUDS                     39,
346,CLOUDS                     39,"I stand there long, before into the gloom"
347,CLOUDS                     39,I take my way.
348,CLOUDS                     39,There are the pictures of my friends
349,CLOUDS                     39,And all the treasures of my room
350,CLOUDS                     39,On which my lamp soft radiance sends.
351,CLOUDS                     39,And long with lingering gaze I look
352,CLOUDS                     39,Upon each much belov√®d book.
353,CLOUDS                     39,"I stand, and dream--before into the gloom"
354,CLOUDS                     39,I sadly take my way.
355,CLOUDS                     39,
356,CLOUDS                     39,And now I gain the field whence I must part
357,CLOUDS                     39,Upon my quest.
358,CLOUDS                     39,My Pegasus of wood and steel
359,CLOUDS                     39,Is ready straining at the start.
360,CLOUDS                     39,The governor is at the wheel--
361,CLOUDS                     39,"And, with an ever-growing roar,"
362,CLOUDS                     39,Across the hidden fields we soar.
363,CLOUDS                     39,"So, with one envious look from Earth I part"
364,CLOUDS                     39,Upon my midnight quest.
365,CLOUDS                     39,
366,CLOUDS                     39,Beneath me lies the sleeping countryside
367,CLOUDS                     39,"Hazy and dim,"
368,CLOUDS                     39,"And here and there a little gleam,"
369,CLOUDS                     39,"Like stars upon the heavens wide,"
370,CLOUDS                     39,Speaks of some wretch who cannot dream--
371,CLOUDS                     39,But on his bed all night must toss
372,CLOUDS                     39,"And hear me as I pass across,"
373,CLOUDS                     39,"In droning flight above the countryside,"
374,CLOUDS                     39,"Hazy, and huge, and dim."
375,CLOUDS                     39,
376,CLOUDS                     39,And in the great blue night I ever rise
377,CLOUDS                     39,"Towards the stars,"
378,CLOUDS                     39,As to the hostile lands I sail
379,CLOUDS                     39,High in the dark and cloudless skies
380,CLOUDS                     39,Whose gloom our gloomy wings doth veil.
381,CLOUDS                     39,"Beneath, a scarce-seen ribbon shows"
382,CLOUDS                     39,"Where through the woods a river flows,"
383,CLOUDS                     39,As in the shadowy night I ever rise
384,CLOUDS                     39,Towards the scattered stars.
385,CLOUDS                     39,
386,CLOUDS                     39,Now high above War's frontiers do I sit--
387,CLOUDS                     39,Above the lines.
388,CLOUDS                     39,"Great lights, like flowers, rise and fall:"
389,CLOUDS                     39,On either side red flashes spit
390,CLOUDS                     39,Hot death at those poor souls which crawl
391,CLOUDS                     39,"On secret errands. O, how grim"
392,CLOUDS                     39,Must be that midnight slaughter dim!
393,CLOUDS                     39,And happy am I that so high I sit
394,CLOUDS                     39,Above those cruel lines!
395,CLOUDS                     39,
396,CLOUDS                     39,Each man beneath me now detests my race
397,CLOUDS                     39,With iron hate.
398,CLOUDS                     39,Each tiny light I see must shine
399,CLOUDS                     39,"Upon some grim, unfriendly face,"
400,CLOUDS                     39,"Who curses England's name and mine,"
401,CLOUDS                     39,And would be glad if both were gone--
402,CLOUDS                     39,"But steadily must I fly on,"
403,CLOUDS                     39,Though every soul beneath me loathes my race
404,CLOUDS                     39,"With stern, unceasing hate."
405,CLOUDS                     39,
406,CLOUDS                     39,I see a far-flung City all ablaze
407,CLOUDS                     39,With jewelled lamps:
408,CLOUDS                     39,"I trace its quays, its roads, its squares,"
409,CLOUDS                     39,"And all its intermingled ways,"
410,CLOUDS                     39,"And, as I wonder how it dares"
411,CLOUDS                     39,"To flaunt itself,--the City dies,"
412,CLOUDS                     39,"And in an utter darkness lies,"
413,CLOUDS                     39,For I have terrified that town ablaze
414,CLOUDS                     39,"With twinkling, jewelled lamps."
415,CLOUDS                     39,
416,CLOUDS                     39,"But, see!--the furnace with its ruddy breath"
417,CLOUDS                     39,Which I must wreck!
418,CLOUDS                     39,The searchlights sweep across the sky--
419,CLOUDS                     39,Long-fingered ministers of Death--
420,CLOUDS                     39,"I look deep in their cold blue eye,"
421,CLOUDS                     39,Incessant shells with blinding light
422,CLOUDS                     39,"Show every wire, clear and white!"
423,CLOUDS                     39,There is the furnace with its ruddy breath
424,CLOUDS                     39,Which I must wreck;--
425,CLOUDS                     39,
426,CLOUDS                     39,It lies beneath--my time has come at last
427,CLOUDS                     39,To do my work!
428,CLOUDS                     39,I wait--O! will you never stop
429,CLOUDS                     39,"Your fearful shells, that burst so fast?--"
430,CLOUDS                     39,And then--I hear destruction drop
431,CLOUDS                     39,Behind my back as I release
432,CLOUDS                     39,Such fearful death with such great ease.
433,CLOUDS                     39,"Burst on, you shells! My time has come at last"
434,CLOUDS                     39,To do my deadly work.
435,CLOUDS                     39,
436,CLOUDS                     39,"Then do I turn, and hurry swiftly back"
437,CLOUDS                     39,Towards my home.
438,CLOUDS                     39,I gladly leave that place behind!
439,CLOUDS                     39,No more I hear the shrapnel's crack--
440,CLOUDS                     39,No more my eyes the searchlights blind.
441,CLOUDS                     39,I cross the lines with lightening breast
442,CLOUDS                     39,And sail into the friendly West.
443,CLOUDS                     39,How glad am I to hurry swiftly back
444,CLOUDS                     39,Towards my peaceful home!
445,CLOUDS                     39,
446,CLOUDS                     39,I reach the field--and then I softly land.
447,CLOUDS                     39,My work is o'er!
448,CLOUDS                     39,"I leave my hot and panting steed,"
449,CLOUDS                     39,"And clasp a comrade's outstretched hand,"
450,CLOUDS                     39,And with him to my bedroom speed.
451,CLOUDS                     39,"Then, over steaming beakers set,"
452,CLOUDS                     39,The night's fierce menace soon forget.
453,CLOUDS                     39,How great a welcome waits me when I land--

497,"FRANCE, 1917.",
498,"FRANCE, 1917.",The day is cold; the wind is strong;
499,"FRANCE, 1917.","And through the sky great cloud-banks throng,"
500,"FRANCE, 1917.",While swathes of snow lie on the ground
501,"FRANCE, 1917.","O'er which I walk without a sound,"
502,"FRANCE, 1917.",But I have vowed to fly to-day
503,"FRANCE, 1917.","Though winds are fierce, and clouds are grey."
504,"FRANCE, 1917.",My aeroplane is on the field;
505,"FRANCE, 1917.","So I must fly--my fate is sealed,"
506,"FRANCE, 1917.",And no excuses can I make;
507,"FRANCE, 1917.",Within its back my place I take.
508,"FRANCE, 1917.",I strap myself inside the seat
509,"FRANCE, 1917.","And press the rudder with my feet,"
510,"FRANCE, 1917.",And hold the wheel with nervous grip
511,"FRANCE, 1917.",And gaze around my little ship--
512,"FRANCE, 1917.",For on its wire-rigging taut
513,"FRANCE, 1917.",Depends my life--which will be short
514,"FRANCE, 1917.",If it should fail me in the air;
515,"FRANCE, 1917.","Swift then my fall, and short my prayer,"
516,"FRANCE, 1917.",And these my wings would be my pyre--
517,"FRANCE, 1917.",So well I scrutinise each wire!
518,"FRANCE, 1917.",Then out across the field I go
519,"FRANCE, 1917.","In shaking progress,--noisy--slow;"
520,"FRANCE, 1917.","And turn, until the wind I face,"
521,"FRANCE, 1917.",Then do I look around a space;
522,"FRANCE, 1917.",For fear to-day is at my heart
523,"FRANCE, 1917.",And nervously I fear to start.
524,"FRANCE, 1917.",The field is clear--the skies are bare--
525,"FRANCE, 1917.",Mine is the freedom of the air!
526,"FRANCE, 1917.","And yet I sit and hesitate,"
527,"FRANCE, 1917.",Although each moment that I wait
528,"FRANCE, 1917.",Brings to my soul a greater fear.
529,"FRANCE, 1917.",To me the grass seems very dear--
530,"FRANCE, 1917.",Dear seems the hut where dreams have crept
531,"FRANCE, 1917.",To me each midnight as I slept--
532,"FRANCE, 1917.","Dear seems the river, by whose brink"
533,"FRANCE, 1917.",I oft have watched brown pebbles sink
534,"FRANCE, 1917.","Deep in the crumbling bridge's shade,"
535,"FRANCE, 1917.",Where in the evening I have strayed!
536,"FRANCE, 1917.",My restless hands hold fast the wheel;
537,"FRANCE, 1917.",Once more the wing-controls I feel.
538,"FRANCE, 1917.","I move the rudder with my feet,"
539,"FRANCE, 1917.",And settle firmly in the seat.
540,"FRANCE, 1917.","I start, and o'er the snowy grass"
541,"FRANCE, 1917.",In ever quicker progress pass:
542,"FRANCE, 1917.","On either side the ground streaks by,"
543,"FRANCE, 1917.",And soon above the grass I fly.
544,"FRANCE, 1917.",I feel the air beneath the wings;
545,"FRANCE, 1917.",At first a greater ease it brings--
546,"FRANCE, 1917.","But soon the stormy strife begins,"
547,"FRANCE, 1917.","And if I lose, 'tis Death who wins."
548,"FRANCE, 1917.","The winds a thousand devils hold,"
549,"FRANCE, 1917.","Who grasp my wings with fingers bold,"
550,"FRANCE, 1917.",And keep me ceaselessly a-rock--
551,"FRANCE, 1917.",I seem to hear those devils mock
552,"FRANCE, 1917.",As I am thrown from side to side
553,"FRANCE, 1917.","In unseen eddies, terrified--"
554,"FRANCE, 1917.","As suddenly I start to drop,"
555,"FRANCE, 1917.","And when my plunging fall I stop,"
556,"FRANCE, 1917.",Up am I swiftly thrown once more!
557,"FRANCE, 1917.","Like no great eagle do I soar,"
558,"FRANCE, 1917.",But like a sparrow tempest-tost
559,"FRANCE, 1917.",I struggle on! My faith is lost:
560,"FRANCE, 1917.","My former confidence is dead,"
561,"FRANCE, 1917.",And whispering fear has come instead.
562,"FRANCE, 1917.",Death ever dogs me close behind--
563,"FRANCE, 1917.",My frightened soul no peace can find.
564,"FRANCE, 1917.","I feel a torture in each nerve,"
565,"FRANCE, 1917.",As to the right or left I swerve.
566,"FRANCE, 1917.",And now Imagination brings
567,"FRANCE, 1917.","Its evil thoughts--I watch the wings,"
568,"FRANCE, 1917.",And wonder if those wings will break--
569,"FRANCE, 1917.",The tight-stretched wires seem to shake.
570,"FRANCE, 1917.","I see the ghastly, headlong rush,"
571,"FRANCE, 1917.",And picture how the fall would crush
572,"FRANCE, 1917.",My helpless body on the ground.
573,"FRANCE, 1917.","With haggard eyes I turn around,"
574,"FRANCE, 1917.","And contemplate the rocking tail,--"
575,"FRANCE, 1917.",My drawn and sweating cheeks are pale.
576,"FRANCE, 1917.",Fear's clammy hands clutch at my heart!
577,"FRANCE, 1917.","I try, with unavailing art,"
578,"FRANCE, 1917.",To summon thoughts of peaceful hours
579,"FRANCE, 1917.",Spent in some sunny field of flowers
580,"FRANCE, 1917.",When my half-opened eyes would look
581,"FRANCE, 1917.","On some old dream-inspiring book,"
582,"FRANCE, 1917.","And not on this accurs√®d wheel,"
583,"FRANCE, 1917.",And on this box of wood and steel
584,"FRANCE, 1917.","In which at pitch-and-toss with Death,"
585,"FRANCE, 1917.","I play, and wonder if each breath"
586,"FRANCE, 1917.","I tensely draw, will be my last."
587,"FRANCE, 1917.",The happy thoughts are swiftly past--
588,"FRANCE, 1917.",My frightened brain forbids them stay.
589,"FRANCE, 1917.","Dear London seems so far away,"
590,"FRANCE, 1917.",And far away my well-loved friends!
591,"FRANCE, 1917.",Each second my existence ends
592,"FRANCE, 1917.","In my disordered mind, whose pace"
593,"FRANCE, 1917.","I cannot check--its cog-wheels race,"
594,"FRANCE, 1917.","Like some ungoverned, whirring clock,"
595,"FRANCE, 1917.","When, frenziedly, it runs amok."
596,"FRANCE, 1917.",I have resolved that I will climb
597,"FRANCE, 1917.",A certain height--how slow seems time
598,"FRANCE, 1917.",As on its sluggish pivot creeps
599,"FRANCE, 1917.","The laggard finger-point, which keeps"
600,"FRANCE, 1917.","The truthful record. O, how slow"
601,"FRANCE, 1917.",Towards the clouds I seem to go!
602,"FRANCE, 1917.",And then ambition gains its mark at last!
603,"FRANCE, 1917.",The little finger o'er the point has passed!
604,"FRANCE, 1917.",I can descend again. With conscience clear
605,"FRANCE, 1917.",And end this battle with persistent fear!
606,"FRANCE, 1917.",The engine's clamour dies--there is no sound
607,"FRANCE, 1917.",Save whistling wires--as towards the ground
608,"FRANCE, 1917.",I gently float. My agony is gone.
609,"FRANCE, 1917.",What peace is mine as I go gliding on!
610,"FRANCE, 1917.",Calm after storm--contentment after pain--

615,"FRANCE, 1917.","Near is the ground, and with the ground comes rest."
616,"FRANCE, 1917.","Above the trees I glide--above the grass,"
617,"FRANCE, 1917.",Above the snow-besprinkled earth I pass.
618,"FRANCE, 1917.","I touch the ground, run swift along, and stop--"
619,"FRANCE, 1917.",Above the wheel my tired shoulders drop.
620,"FRANCE, 1917.","I leave my seat, and slowly move away ..."
621,"FRANCE, 1917.","Cold is the wind: the clouds are grey,"
622,"FRANCE, 1917.","I only wish my room to gain,"
623,"FRANCE, 1917.","And in some book forget my pain,"
