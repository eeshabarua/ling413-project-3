81,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
82,INTRODUCTION,
83,INTRODUCTION,Sassoon the Man
84,INTRODUCTION,
85,INTRODUCTION,"In appearance he is tall, big-boned, loosely built. He"
86,INTRODUCTION,"is clean-shaven, pale or with a flush; has a heavy jaw,"
87,INTRODUCTION,wide mouth with the upper lip slightly protruding and
88,INTRODUCTION,the curve of it very pronounced like that of a shrivelled
89,INTRODUCTION,leaf (as I have noticed is common in many poets).
90,INTRODUCTION,"His nose is aquiline, the nostrils being wide and heavily"
91,INTRODUCTION,"arched. This characteristic and the fullness, depth and"
92,INTRODUCTION,heat of his dark eyes give him the air of a sullen
93,INTRODUCTION,"falcon. He speaks slowly, enunciating the words as if"
94,INTRODUCTION,"they pained him, in a voice that has something of the"
95,INTRODUCTION,troubled thickness apparent in the voices of those who
96,INTRODUCTION,"emerge from a deep grief. As he speaks, his large"
97,INTRODUCTION,"hands, roughened by trench toil and by riding, wander"
98,INTRODUCTION,aimlessly until some emotion grips him when the
99,INTRODUCTION,knuckles harden and he clutches at his knees or at the
100,INTRODUCTION,edge of the table. And all the while he will be breathing
101,INTRODUCTION,hard like a man who has swum a distance. When
102,INTRODUCTION,he reads his poems he chants and one would think
103,INTRODUCTION,"that he communed with himself save that, at the"
104,INTRODUCTION,"pauses, he shoots a powerful glance at the listener."
105,INTRODUCTION,Between the poems he is still but moves his lips...
106,INTRODUCTION,"He likes best to speak of hunting (he will shout of it!),"
107,INTRODUCTION,of open air mornings when the gorse alone flames
108,INTRODUCTION,"brighter than the sky, of country quiet, of his mother,"
109,INTRODUCTION,
110,INTRODUCTION,[Footnote: His father was a well-to-do country gentleman of
111,INTRODUCTION,"Anglo-Jewish stock, his mother an English woman, a Miss"
112,INTRODUCTION,"Thornycroft, sister of the sculptor of that name.]"
113,INTRODUCTION,
114,INTRODUCTION,"of poetry--usually Shelley, Masefield and Thomas"
115,INTRODUCTION,"Hardy--and last and chiefly--but always with a rapid,"
116,INTRODUCTION,tumbling enunciation and a much-irked desperate air
117,INTRODUCTION,filled with pain--of soldiers. For the incubus of war
118,INTRODUCTION,is on him so that his days are shot with anguish and
119,INTRODUCTION,his nights with horror.
120,INTRODUCTION,
121,INTRODUCTION,He is twenty-eight years old; was educated at
122,INTRODUCTION,"Marlborough and Christchurch, Oxford; was a master of"
123,INTRODUCTION,fox-hounds and is a captain in the Royal Welsh
124,INTRODUCTION,Fusiliers. Thrice he has fought in France and once in
125,INTRODUCTION,Palestine. Behind his name are set the letters M.C.
126,INTRODUCTION,since he has won the Military Cross for an act of
127,INTRODUCTION,valour which went near to securing him a higher
128,INTRODUCTION,honour.
129,INTRODUCTION,
130,INTRODUCTION,Sassoon the Poet
131,INTRODUCTION,
132,INTRODUCTION,The poetry of Siegfried Sassoon divides itself into
133,INTRODUCTION,two rough classes--the idyllic and the satiric. War
134,INTRODUCTION,has defiled one to produce the other. At heart
135,INTRODUCTION,Siegfried Sassoon is an idealist.
136,INTRODUCTION,
137,INTRODUCTION,Before the war he had hardly published a line. He
138,INTRODUCTION,"spent his summers in the company of books, at the"
139,INTRODUCTION,"piano, on expeditions, and in playing tennis. During"
140,INTRODUCTION,winter he hunted. Hunting was a greater passion with
141,INTRODUCTION,him than poetry. Much of his poetry celebrated the
142,INTRODUCTION,loveliness of the field as seen by the huntsman in the
143,INTRODUCTION,early morning light. But few probably guessed that
144,INTRODUCTION,the youth known to excel in field sports excelled also
145,INTRODUCTION,"in poetry. For, in its way, this early poetry does excel."
146,INTRODUCTION,It was characteristic of him that nearly every little
147,INTRODUCTION,book he then wrote was privately printed. Poetry was
148,INTRODUCTION,for him just something for private and particular
149,INTRODUCTION,enjoyment--like a ride alone before breakfast.  Among
150,INTRODUCTION,these privately printed books are Twelve Sonnets
151,INTRODUCTION,"(1911), Melodies, An Ode for Music, Hyacinth"
152,INTRODUCTION,(all 1912). The names are significant. He was occupied
153,INTRODUCTION,with natural beauty and with music.  In 1913 he
154,INTRODUCTION,publishes in a limited and obscure edition Apollo in
155,INTRODUCTION,"Doelyrium, wherein it seems that he is beginning to"
156,INTRODUCTION,find a certain want of body and basis in his poems
157,INTRODUCTION,made of beautiful words about beautiful objects.
158,INTRODUCTION,"Later in the same year, with Masefield's Everlasting"
159,INTRODUCTION,"Mercy (1911), Widow in the Bye Sheet (1912) and"
160,INTRODUCTION,"Daffodil Fields (1913) before him, he starts to write a"
161,INTRODUCTION,parody of these uncouth intrusions of the sorrows of
162,INTRODUCTION,obscure persons into his paradise but half way through
163,INTRODUCTION,the poem adopts the Masefield manner in earnest
164,INTRODUCTION,
165,INTRODUCTION,[Footnote: I had this from his own mouth.]
166,INTRODUCTION,
167,INTRODUCTION,and finishes by unsuccessfully endeavouring to rival his
168,INTRODUCTION,master. In 1914 the War breaks out. Home on leave
169,INTRODUCTION,"in 1915 he privately prints Discoveries, a little book"
170,INTRODUCTION,which contains some of the loveliest of his 'paradise'
171,INTRODUCTION,poems. In 1916 the change has come. He can hardly
172,INTRODUCTION,believe it himself. 'Morning Glory' (privately printed)
173,INTRODUCTION,includes four war poems. He has not definitely
174,INTRODUCTION,turned to his later style but he hovers on the brink.
175,INTRODUCTION,The war is beginning to pain him. The poems 'To
176,INTRODUCTION,Victory' and 'The Dragon and the Undying' show him
177,INTRODUCTION,turning toward his paradise to see if its beauty can save
178,INTRODUCTION,him ... The year 1917 witnesses the publication of
179,INTRODUCTION,The Old Huntsman.
180,INTRODUCTION,
181,INTRODUCTION,"[Footnote: 'The Old Huntsman,' Dutton & Co., 1918.]"
182,INTRODUCTION,
183,INTRODUCTION,This book secured instantaneous success.
184,INTRODUCTION,"Siegfried Sassoon, on its publication,"
185,INTRODUCTION,became one of the leading young poets of England.
186,INTRODUCTION,The book begins with the long monologue of a retired
187,INTRODUCTION,"huntsman, a piece of remarkable characterisation."
188,INTRODUCTION,It continues with all the best of the 'paradise'
189,INTRODUCTION,"poems, including the loveliest in 'Discoveries' and"
190,INTRODUCTION,'Morning Glory.' There are also the 'bridge' poems
191,INTRODUCTION,between his old manner and his new such as the 'To
192,INTRODUCTION,Victory' mentioned above. But interspersed among
193,INTRODUCTION,the paradise poems are the first poems in his final war
194,INTRODUCTION,style. He tells the story of the change in a characteristic
195,INTRODUCTION,"manner--Conscripts (page 51, 'The Old Huntsman')."
196,INTRODUCTION,"For like nearly every one of the young English poets,"
197,INTRODUCTION,"he is to some extent a humourist. His humour is not,"
198,INTRODUCTION,"however, even through 'The Old Huntsman' all"
199,INTRODUCTION,of such a wise and gentle tenor. He breaks out into
200,INTRODUCTION,"lively bitterness in such poems as 'They,'"
201,INTRODUCTION,'The Tombstone Maker' and 'Blighters.'

212,CONSCRIPTS,"They gasped and sweated, marching up and down."
213,CONSCRIPTS,I drilled them till they cursed my raucous shout.
214,CONSCRIPTS,Love chucked his lute away and dropped his crown.
215,CONSCRIPTS,Rhyme got sore heels and wanted to fall out.
216,CONSCRIPTS,"""Left, right! Press on your butts!"" They looked at me"
217,CONSCRIPTS,Reproachful; how I longed to set them free!
218,CONSCRIPTS,
219,CONSCRIPTS,"I gave them lectures on Defence, Attack;"
220,CONSCRIPTS,"They fidgeted and shuffled, yawned and sighed,"
221,CONSCRIPTS,"And boggled at my questions. Joy was slack,"
222,CONSCRIPTS,"And Wisdom gnawed his fingers, gloomy-eyed."
223,CONSCRIPTS,Young Fancy--how I loved him all the while--

228,CONSCRIPTS,"Rapture and pale Enchantment and Romance,"
229,CONSCRIPTS,"And many a sickly, slender lord who'd filled"
230,CONSCRIPTS,My soul long since with litanies of sin.
231,CONSCRIPTS,"Went home, because they couldn't stand the din."
232,CONSCRIPTS,
233,CONSCRIPTS,"But the kind, common ones that I despised,"
234,CONSCRIPTS,"(Hardly a man of them I'd count as friend),"
235,CONSCRIPTS,What stubborn-hearted virtues they disguised!
236,CONSCRIPTS,"They stood and played the hero to the end,"
237,CONSCRIPTS,"Won gold and silver medals bright with bars,"
238,CONSCRIPTS,And marched resplendent home with crowns and stars.
239,CONSCRIPTS,
240,CONSCRIPTS,This book (in consequence almost wholly of these
241,CONSCRIPTS,bitter poems) enjoyed a remarkable success with the
242,CONSCRIPTS,soldiers fighting in France. One met it everywhere.
243,CONSCRIPTS,"""Hello, you know Siegfried Sassoon then, do you?"
244,CONSCRIPTS,"Well, tell him from me that the more he lays it on thick"
245,CONSCRIPTS,to those who don't realize the war the better. That's
246,CONSCRIPTS,the stuff we want. We're fed up with the old men's
247,CONSCRIPTS,"death-or-glory stunt."" In 1918 appeared 'Countermans'"
248,CONSCRIPTS,Attack': here there is hardly a trace of the 'paradise'
249,CONSCRIPTS,feeling. You can't even think of paradise when you're
250,CONSCRIPTS,in hell. For Sassoon was now well along the way of
251,CONSCRIPTS,thorns. How many lives had he not seen spilled apparently
252,CONSCRIPTS,to no purpose? Did not the fact of war arch
253,CONSCRIPTS,"him in like a dirty blood-red sky? He breaks out,"
254,CONSCRIPTS,"almost like a mad man, into imprecations, into"
255,CONSCRIPTS,"vehement tirades, into sarcasms, ironies, the hellish"
256,CONSCRIPTS,laughters that arise from a heart that is not broken
257,CONSCRIPTS,once for all but that is newly broken every day while
258,CONSCRIPTS,the Monster that devours the lives of the young
259,CONSCRIPTS,"continues its ravages. Take, for instance, the magnificent"
260,CONSCRIPTS,"'To Any Dead Officer', written just before America"
261,CONSCRIPTS,entered the war. Many reading this poem would think
262,CONSCRIPTS,Great Britain was going to cease fighting. But nothing
263,CONSCRIPTS,of the sort. One must always remember that bitter
264,CONSCRIPTS,as these imprecations are against those who mismanaged
265,CONSCRIPTS,"certain episodes in the war, the ultimate foe"
266,CONSCRIPTS,is not they but the German Junkers who planned this
267,CONSCRIPTS,"war for forty years, who have given the lovely earth"
268,CONSCRIPTS,over to hideous defilement and the youths of all nations
269,CONSCRIPTS,to carnage...
270,CONSCRIPTS,
271,CONSCRIPTS,Sometimes in this book Sassoon fails to express himself
272,CONSCRIPTS,"properly. This fact is, I think, a tribute to his"
273,CONSCRIPTS,sincerity. For his earlier work very clearly displays
274,CONSCRIPTS,his technical proficiency. But here what can he do?
275,CONSCRIPTS,Indignation chokes and strangles him. He claws often
276,CONSCRIPTS,"enough at unsatisfactory words, dislocates his"
277,CONSCRIPTS,"sentences, tumbles out his images as if he would pulp the"
278,CONSCRIPTS,makers of war beneath them. Very rarely does he
279,CONSCRIPTS,attain to the poignant simplicity of 'The Hawthorn
280,CONSCRIPTS,Tree' or the detached irony of 'Does it Matter?'
281,CONSCRIPTS,
282,CONSCRIPTS,Can he then see nothing else in war? I remember
283,CONSCRIPTS,him once turning to me and saying suddenly apropos
284,CONSCRIPTS,of certain exalté poems in my 'Ardours and
285,CONSCRIPTS,"Endurances': 'Yes, I see all that and I agree with"
286,CONSCRIPTS,"you, Robert. War has made me. I think I am a man now"
287,CONSCRIPTS,as well as a poet. You have said the things well
288,CONSCRIPTS,enough. Now let us nevermore say another word of
289,CONSCRIPTS,whatever little may be good in war for the individual
290,CONSCRIPTS,who has a heart to be steeled.'
291,CONSCRIPTS,
292,CONSCRIPTS,"I remember I nodded, for further acquaintance with"
293,CONSCRIPTS,war inclines me to his opinion.
294,CONSCRIPTS,
295,CONSCRIPTS,"'Let no one ever,' he continued, 'from henceforth"
296,CONSCRIPTS,say a word in any way countenancing war. It is dangerous
297,CONSCRIPTS,even to speak of how here and there the individual
298,CONSCRIPTS,may gain some hardship of soul by it. For war
299,CONSCRIPTS,is hell and those who institute it are criminals. Were
300,CONSCRIPTS,"there anything to say for it, it should not be said for"
301,CONSCRIPTS,its spiritual disasters far outweigh any of its advantages.'
302,CONSCRIPTS,
303,CONSCRIPTS,For myself this is the truth. War doesn't ennoble:
304,CONSCRIPTS,it degrades. The words of Barbusse placed at the beginning
305,CONSCRIPTS,of this book should be engraved over the doors
306,CONSCRIPTS,of every war office of every State in the world.
307,CONSCRIPTS,
308,CONSCRIPTS,While war is a possibility man is little better than
309,CONSCRIPTS,a savage and civilisation the mere moments of rest
310,CONSCRIPTS,between a succession of nightmares. It is to help to
311,CONSCRIPTS,end this horror that Siegfried Sassoon and the many
312,CONSCRIPTS,others who feel like him have continued to fight as
313,CONSCRIPTS,after the publication of this book he fought in Palestine
314,CONSCRIPTS,and in France.
315,CONSCRIPTS,
316,CONSCRIPTS,You civilized persons who read this book not only as
317,CONSCRIPTS,a poet but as a soldier I beg of you not to turn from it.
318,CONSCRIPTS,Read it again and again till its words become part of
319,CONSCRIPTS,your consciousness. It was written by a man for mankind's
320,CONSCRIPTS,"sake, that 'that which is humane' might no more be an"
321,CONSCRIPTS,"empty phrase, that the words of Blake might blossom"
322,CONSCRIPTS,to a new meaning--
323,CONSCRIPTS,
324,CONSCRIPTS,"Thou art a man, God is no more,"
325,CONSCRIPTS,Thine own humanity learn to adore.

380,COUNTER-ATTACK,And clink of shovels deepening the shallow trench.
381,COUNTER-ATTACK,The place was rotten with dead; green clumsy legs
382,COUNTER-ATTACK,"High-booted, sprawled and grovelled along the saps;"
383,COUNTER-ATTACK,"And trunks, face downward, in the sucking mud,"
384,COUNTER-ATTACK,Wallowed like trodden sand-bags loosely filled;

393,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Traversing, sure as fate, and never a dud."
394,COUNTER-ATTACK,Mute in the clamour of shells he watched them burst
395,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Spouting dark earth and wire with gusts from hell,"

406,COUNTER-ATTACK,And stumbling figures looming out in front.
407,COUNTER-ATTACK,"""O Christ, they're coming at us!"" Bullets spat,"
408,COUNTER-ATTACK,And he remembered his rifle ... rapid fire ...
409,COUNTER-ATTACK,
410,COUNTER-ATTACK,And started blazing wildly ... then a bang
411,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Crumpled and spun him sideways, knocked him out"
412,COUNTER-ATTACK,To grunt and wriggle: none heeded him; he choked
413,COUNTER-ATTACK,"And fought the flapping veils of smothering gloom,"
414,COUNTER-ATTACK,Lost in a blurred confusion of yells and groans ...
415,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Down, and down, and down, he sank and drowned,"

876,TRENCH DUTY,Of flickering horror in the sectors where
877,TRENCH DUTY,"We raid the Boche; men waiting, stiff and chilled,"
878,TRENCH DUTY,Or crawling on their bellies through the wire.
879,TRENCH DUTY,"""What? Stretcher-bearers wanted? Some one killed?"""
880,TRENCH DUTY,Five minutes ago I heard a sniper fire:

890,BREAK OF DAY,
891,BREAK OF DAY,There seemed a smell of autumn in the air
892,BREAK OF DAY,At the bleak end of night; he shivered there
893,BREAK OF DAY,"In a dank, musty dug-out where he lay,"
894,BREAK OF DAY,"Legs wrapped in sand-bags,--lumps of chalk and clay"
895,BREAK OF DAY,"Spattering his face. Dry-mouthed, he thought, ""To-day"
896,BREAK OF DAY,"We start the damned attack; and, Lord knows why,"
897,BREAK OF DAY,Zero's at nine; how bloody if I'm done in
898,BREAK OF DAY,"Under the freedom of that morning sky!"""
899,BREAK OF DAY,"And then he coughed and dozed, cursing the din."
900,BREAK OF DAY,
901,BREAK OF DAY,Was it the ghost of autumn in that smell
902,BREAK OF DAY,"Of underground, or God's blank heart grown kind,"
903,BREAK OF DAY,That sent a happy dream to him in hell?--
904,BREAK OF DAY,"Where men are crushed like clods, and crawl to find"
905,BREAK OF DAY,Some crater for their wretchedness; who lie
906,BREAK OF DAY,"In outcast immolation, doomed to die"
907,BREAK OF DAY,"Far from clean things or any hope of cheer,"
908,BREAK OF DAY,"Cowed anger in their eyes, till darkness brims"
909,BREAK OF DAY,"And roars into their heads, and they can hear"
910,BREAK OF DAY,"Old childish talk, and tags of foolish hymns."
911,BREAK OF DAY,
912,BREAK OF DAY,He sniffs the chilly air; (his dreaming starts).
913,BREAK OF DAY,He's riding in a dusty Sussex lane
914,BREAK OF DAY,In quiet September; slowly night departs;
915,BREAK OF DAY,"And he's a living soul, absolved from pain."
916,BREAK OF DAY,Beyond the brambled fences where he goes
917,BREAK OF DAY,"Are glimmering fields with harvest piled in sheaves,"
918,BREAK OF DAY,And tree-tops dark against the stars grown pale;
919,BREAK OF DAY,"Then, clear and shrill, a distant farm-cock crows;"
920,BREAK OF DAY,And there's a wall of mist along the vale
921,BREAK OF DAY,Where willows shake their watery-sounding leaves.
922,BREAK OF DAY,"He gazes on it all, and scarce believes"
923,BREAK OF DAY,That earth is telling its old peaceful tale;
924,BREAK OF DAY,He thanks the blessed world that he was born ...
925,BREAK OF DAY,"Then, far away, a lonely note of the horn."
926,BREAK OF DAY,
927,BREAK OF DAY,"They're drawing the Big Wood! Unlatch the gate,"
928,BREAK OF DAY,And set Golumpus going on the grass:
929,BREAK OF DAY,_He_ knows the corner where it's best to wait
930,BREAK OF DAY,And hear the crashing woodland chorus pass;
931,BREAK OF DAY,The corner where old foxes make their track
932,BREAK OF DAY,To the Long Spinney; that's the place to be.
933,BREAK OF DAY,"The bracken shakes below an ivied tree,"
934,BREAK OF DAY,"And then a cub looks out; and ""Tally-o-back!"""
935,BREAK OF DAY,"He bawls, and swings his thong with volleying crack,--"
936,BREAK OF DAY,"All the clean thrill of autumn in his blood,"
937,BREAK OF DAY,And hunting surging through him like a flood
938,BREAK OF DAY,In joyous welcome from the untroubled past;
939,BREAK OF DAY,"While the war drifts away, forgotten at last."
940,BREAK OF DAY,
941,BREAK OF DAY,"Now a red, sleepy sun above the rim"
942,BREAK OF DAY,"Of twilight stares along the quiet weald,"
943,BREAK OF DAY,"And the kind, simple country shines revealed"
944,BREAK OF DAY,"In solitudes of peace, no longer dim."
945,BREAK OF DAY,"The old horse lifts his face and thanks the light,"
946,BREAK OF DAY,Then stretches down his head to crop the green.
947,BREAK OF DAY,All things that he has loved are in his sight;
948,BREAK OF DAY,The places where his happiness has been
949,BREAK OF DAY,"Are in his eyes, his heart, and they are good."

1286,I,The substance of my dreams took fire.
1287,I,"You built cathedrals in my heart,"
1288,I,And lit my pinnacled desire.
1289,I,You were the ardour and the bright
1290,I,Procession of my thoughts toward prayer.
1291,I,"You were the wrath of storm, the light"
1292,I,On distant citadels aflare.
1293,I,
1294,II,II
1295,II,
1296,II,"Great names, I cannot find you now"
1297,II,In these loud years of youth that strives
1298,II,Through doom toward peace: upon my brow
1299,II,I wear a wreath of banished lives.
1300,II,You have no part with lads who fought
1301,II,And laughed and suffered at my side.
1302,II,Your fugues and symphonies have brought
1303,II,No memory of my friends who died.
1304,II,
1305,III,III
1306,III,
1307,III,"For when my brain is on their track,"
1308,III,In slangy speech I call them back.
1309,III,With fox-trot tunes their ghosts I charm.
1310,III,"_""Another little drink won't do us any harm."""
1311,III,I think of rag-time; a bit of rag-time;
1312,III,And see their faces crowding round
1313,III,To the sound of the syncopated beat.
1314,III,"They've got such jolly things to tell,"
1315,III,Home from hell with a Blighty wound so neat..._
1316,III,*       *       *       *       *
1317,III,And so the song breaks off; and I'm alone.
1318,III,They're dead... For God's sake stop that gramophone.

1327,I,I
1328,I,
1329,I,"Moonlight and dew-drenched blossom, and the scent"
1330,I,Of summer gardens; these can bring you all
1331,I,Those dreams that in the starlit silence fall:
1332,I,Sweet songs are full of odours.
1333,I,While I went
1334,I,"Last night in drizzling dusk along a lane,"
1335,I,I passed a squalid farm; from byre and midden
1336,I,Came the rank smell that brought me once again
1337,I,A dream of war that in the past was hidden.
1338,I,
1339,II,II
1340,II,
1341,II,Up a disconsolate straggling village street
1342,II,I saw the tired troops trudge: I heard their feet.
1343,II,The cheery Q.M.S. was there to meet
1344,II,And guide our Company in ...
1345,II,I watched them stumble
1346,II,"Into some crazy hovel, too beat to grumble;"
1347,II,"Saw them file inward, slipping from their backs"
1348,II,"Rifles, equipment, packs."
1349,II,"On filthy straw they sit in the gloom, each face"
1350,II,"Bowed to patched, sodden boots they must unlace,"
1351,II,While the wind chills their sweat through chinks and cracks.
1352,II,
1353,III,III
1354,III,
1355,III,I'm looking at their blistered feet; young Jones
1356,III,"Stares up at me, mud-splashed and white and jaded;"
1357,III,Out of his eyes the morning light has faded.
1358,III,Old soldiers with three winters in their bones
1359,III,"Puff their damp Woodbines, whistle, stretch their toes:"
1360,III,"_They_ can still grin at me, for each of 'em knows"
1361,III,That I'm as tired as they are ...
1362,III,Can they guess
1363,III,The secret burden that is always mine?--
1364,III,Pride in their courage; pity for their distress;
1365,III,And burning bitterness
1366,III,That I must take them to the accursèd Line.
1367,III,
1368,IV,IV
1369,IV,
1370,IV,"I cannot hear their voices, but I see"
1371,IV,"Dim candles in the barn: they gulp their tea,"
1372,IV,And soon they'll sleep like logs. Ten miles away
1373,IV,The battle winks and thuds in blundering strife.
1374,IV,"And I must lead them nearer, day by day,"
1375,IV,To the foul beast of war that bludgeons life.
