59,PREFACE,"I have divided this book into three distinct parts. Part I, Trench"
60,PREFACE,"Ballads, consists of forty American soldier poems of America's"
61,PREFACE,"participation in the World War, 1917-19, based entirely on actual facts"
62,PREFACE,"and incidents, and almost exclusively on my own personal experiences and"
63,PREFACE,"observations, when a private in Company G, 16th Infantry, First"
64,PREFACE,"Division, of the American Expeditionary Forces in France. Part II,"
65,PREFACE,"Pre-war Poems, consists of three sets of verses written just before the"
66,PREFACE,"active entry of America in the war, and appertaining to, but not an"
67,PREFACE,"integral part of, it, and therefore grouped separately. Part III, Other"
68,PREFACE,"Poems, contains those of a general and non-military character."
69,PREFACE,
70,PREFACE,"It is highly desirable the ""Notes"" at the end of this volume should be"
71,PREFACE,"consulted, and that it be realized that with few exceptions, all these"
72,PREFACE,"Trench Ballads were written in France, many scribbled on odd pieces of"
73,PREFACE,"paper or on old envelopes in the trenches themselves, and consequently,"
74,PREFACE,"when present locality is intimated, it is always France, that is to say,"
75,PREFACE,from the standpoint that I am speaking in and from the seat of
76,PREFACE,"operations. For example, when I use the term ""over here,"" it really"
77,PREFACE,"means what the people at home in America would call ""over there."""
78,PREFACE,"Hyperbole or little characteristic anecdotes that really never occurred,"
79,PREFACE,"except in the brain of an author, I have absolutely shunned, and have"
80,PREFACE,"endeavored to adhere strictly to ""the truth, the whole truth and nothing"
81,PREFACE,"but the truth,"" and to set forth the vicissitudes; the dangers, joys and"
82,PREFACE,"tribulations of the army man, and especially the man in the ranks, and"
83,PREFACE,"more especially the man in the ranks of the Infantry, as these latter"
84,PREFACE,formed the actual front-line or combat troops that bore the brunt in
85,PREFACE,this greatest of all wars.
86,PREFACE,
87,PREFACE,"Absolute continuity or sequence would seem superfluous, but it will be"
88,PREFACE,"observed that I have endeavored to maintain it to a certain extent,"
89,PREFACE,"i.e., by gradually leading from a number of military verses, without any"
90,PREFACE,"strict inter-relation, to the day of being wounded, then on to several"
91,PREFACE,"poems concerning the military hospital, and finally bringing the Trench"
92,PREFACE,Ballads to a close with those having to do with the returning home of
93,PREFACE,the soldier.
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,"My previous book, ""Army Ballads and Other Verses,"" is the result of my"
96,PREFACE,"experiences when serving as a private in Companies ""L"" and ""G,"" 23rd"
97,PREFACE,"Infantry and Troop ""I,"" 5th Cavalry (Regulars), during the Philippine"
98,PREFACE,"Insurrection of 1899-1902, and if ""Army Ballads and Other Verses"" is"
99,PREFACE,"taken in conjunction with this volume, it is my hope together they may"
100,PREFACE,prove a fairly comprehensive anthology of the American soldier of recent
101,PREFACE,times.

1415,II,
1416,II,"Because, upon an inky night,"
1417,II,"When mist hung o'er the nation,"
1418,II,The captain took a picked patrol
1419,II,To gather information.
1420,II,
1421,II,"And as they crept on hands and knees,"
1422,II,"In Land No Man may own,"

1436,II,"And he? He running true to form,"

1456,II,Just what the purport of his last

1515,INTERRUPTED CHOW.,I'll now narrate to you.

1517,INTERRUPTED CHOW.,'Twas midnight--hush! the plot grows thick--

1519,INTERRUPTED CHOW.,'Twas midnight--and the slum-cart came
1520,INTERRUPTED CHOW.,Upon its round of death.

1522,INTERRUPTED CHOW.,(It isn't really that the slum

1547,INTERRUPTED CHOW.,"More calm, beneficent and mild--"

1562,INTERRUPTED CHOW.,"Earth, rocks and stars commingling"

1566,INTERRUPTED CHOW.,
1567,INTERRUPTED CHOW.,And when I found that I was there--
1568,INTERRUPTED CHOW.,"Both arms, both legs, and head,"

3045,A. E. F.,using the most punctilious care to enunciate each and every one of
3046,A. E. F.,the four syllables. Whether this is due to the word being foreign to
3047,A. E. F.,"many of them, or whether it is due to their all-saving subtle sense"
3048,A. E. F.,"of American humor, so that it seems rather delicious to call the"
3049,A. E. F.,"little French ladies by so long and ponderous a title, I really do"
3050,A. E. F.,"not know, but I strongly suspect that it is the latter."

3052,A. E. F.,The First Division
3053,A. E. F.,"Caesar had his Tenth Legion, Napoleon had his Old Guard, and the"
3054,A. E. F.,American Army during the World War had its First Division. It might
3055,A. E. F.,therefore not seem entirely malapropos to quote the words of the
3056,A. E. F.,"great French general Mangin, who was the corps commander of the"
3057,A. E. F.,"First Division of the American Army, the famous First Moroccans of"
3058,A. E. F.,"the French Army and the Second Division of the American Army, at the"
3059,A. E. F.,"Second Battle of the Marne, that began on July 18th, 1918, and was"
3060,A. E. F.,the turning point of the whole war. In this great door movement the
3061,A. E. F.,First Division was given practically the post of honor at the
3062,A. E. F.,"_hinge_ itself, i.e., directly at Soissons, only one division, the"
3063,A. E. F.,"153rd French Infantry Division, being on the inside of the First"
3064,A. E. F.,"Division, and as it was in this engagement that a gentleman of"
3065,A. E. F.,"Teutonic origin, operating a machine-gun from our extreme left"
3066,A. E. F.,"flank, and apparently very much irritated about something, put a"
3067,A. E. F.,"bullet in my side and out my back, it is only natural that the"
3068,A. E. F.,"message of Gen. Mangin was of interest to me, and saved, and here"

3076,A. E. F.,"With the French. Army in France, Aug. 7.--General Mangin, who was in"
3077,A. E. F.,direct command of the Allied forces in the drive against the German
3078,A. E. F.,"right flank south of Soissons, has issued the following order of the"
3079,A. E. F.,day thanking the American troops for their brilliant participation
3080,A. E. F.,in the battle which caused the German retreat between the Marne and
3081,A. E. F.,the Aisne:
3082,A. E. F.,
3083,A. E. F.,"""Officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the Third"
3084,A. E. F.,American Army Corps:
3085,A. E. F.,
3086,A. E. F.,"""Shoulder to shoulder with your French comrades, you threw"
3087,A. E. F.,yourselves into the counter-offensive begun on July 18th. You ran to
3088,A. E. F.,it like going to a feast. Your magnificent dash upset and surprised
3089,A. E. F.,the enemy and your indomitable tenacity stopped counter-attacks by
3090,A. E. F.,his fresh divisions. You have shown yourselves to be worthy sons of
3091,A. E. F.,your great country and have gained the admiration of your brothers
3092,A. E. F.,in arms.
3093,A. E. F.,
3094,A. E. F.,"""Ninety-one cannon, 7,200 prisoners, immense booty and ten"
3095,A. E. F.,kilometers (six and a quarter miles) of reconquered territory are
3096,A. E. F.,"your share of the trophies of this victory. Besides this, you have"
3097,A. E. F.,acquired a feeling of your superiority over the barbarian enemy
3098,A. E. F.,against whom the children of liberty are fighting. To attack him is
3099,A. E. F.,to vanquish him.
3100,A. E. F.,
3101,A. E. F.,"""American comrades, I am grateful to you for the blood you"
3102,A. E. F.,generously spilled on the soil of my country. I am proud of having
3103,A. E. F.,"commanded you during such splendid days, and to have fought with you"
3104,A. E. F.,"for the deliverance of the world."""

3107,A. E. F.,"in giving a tabulated form of the record of the various divisions,"
3108,A. E. F.,"and their insignia, which was worn on the shoulder of the left"
3109,A. E. F.,"sleeve, said the following of the First Division:--"
3110,A. E. F.,
3111,A. E. F.,"Division Insignia: Crimson figure ""1"" on khaki background, chosen"
3112,A. E. F.,"because the numeral ""1"" represents the number of the division and"
3113,A. E. F.,"many of its subsidiary organizations. Also, as proudly claimed,"
3114,A. E. F.,"because it was the ""First Division in France; first in sector; first"
3115,A. E. F.,to fire a shot at the Germans; first to attack; first to conduct a
3116,A. E. F.,raid; first to be raided; first to capture prisoners; first to
3117,A. E. F.,inflict casualties; first to suffer casualties; first to be cited
3118,A. E. F.,"singly in General Orders; first in the number of Division, Corps and"
3119,A. E. F.,Army Commanders and General Staff Officers produced from its
3120,A. E. F.,"personnel."""
3121,A. E. F.,
3122,A. E. F.,"To this might have been added that the First Division, which was a"
3123,A. E. F.,"Regular Army division, and originally comprised about twenty or"
3124,A. E. F.,"thirty per cent ""old soldiers,"" and the rest of us ""war volunteers,"""
3125,A. E. F.,"but proud of being ""Regulars,"" the First Division, which consisted"
3126,A. E. F.,"of the 16th, 18th, 26th and 28th Infantry Regiments, the 5th, 6th"
3127,A. E. F.,"and 7th Field Artillery Regiments, the 1st Engineer Regiment, and a"
3128,A. E. F.,"complement of Cavalry, etc., was the division that General Pershing,"
3129,A. E. F.,"the commander-in-chief, picked out to fill the most vital positions"
3130,A. E. F.,"on important occasions, as, for example, when, from the whole army,"
3131,A. E. F.,he chose the First Division to go into the front line just west of
3132,A. E. F.,"Montdidier, at the Battle of Picardy, to help hold the very apex of"
3133,A. E. F.,the huge German bulge that had swept southwestward from St. Quentin
3134,A. E. F.,"to Montdidier, in the great series of Hun drives which started on"
3135,A. E. F.,"March 21st. 1918. Again, it was the First Division that Pershing"
3136,A. E. F.,placed at Soissons at virtually the hinge of the great door movement
3137,A. E. F.,"in the turning point of the whole war, the Second Battle of the"
3138,A. E. F.,"Marne, as heretofore described; and it was the First Division to"
3139,A. E. F.,which Pershing again gave the post of honor when the St. Mihiel
3140,A. E. F.,"salient was closed, as it was this Division that was placed on the"
3141,A. E. F.,"inside position of the great southern jaw, just east of Xivray and"
3142,A. E. F.,dangerous Mont Sec.
3143,A. E. F.,
3144,A. E. F.,"Casualties and kilometers make very interesting reading, but when a"
3145,A. E. F.,Commander-in-chief consistently and persistently picks out one
3146,A. E. F.,"certain division for the most difficult and all-important positions,"
3147,A. E. F.,there is not much room for argumentation.
3148,A. E. F.,
3149,A. E. F.,"Mr. Page, in his article in _The World's Work_, for May. 1919. in"
3150,A. E. F.,"describing the Second Battle of the Marne, tells how the First"
3151,A. E. F.,Division went over the top with the 153rd French Infantry Division
3152,A. E. F.,"on its left, and the famous First Moroccan Division and the Second"
3153,A. E. F.,"Division of the American Army on its right, and how, in this"
3154,A. E. F.,"gruelling engagement, the First Division outlasted both the Second"
3155,A. E. F.,"Division and the First Moroccans, and really also the 153rd French"
3156,A. E. F.,"Division on its left, as this latter was obliged to get"
3157,A. E. F.,"reinforcements, Mr. Page recapitulating the situation with the"
3158,A. E. F.,following paragraph:--
3159,A. E. F.,
3160,A. E. F.,"""When the division (the First Division) finally came out of the line"
3161,A. E. F.,"it had lost more than 7,200 men, mostly in the infantry. The full"
3162,A. E. F.,complement of infantry in a division is 12.000. Five days' constant
3163,A. E. F.,and successful attack after a long march: an advance of more than
3164,A. E. F.,six and a quarter miles (ten kilometers); losses of at least 50 per
3165,A. E. F.,"cent, of the infantry engaged: keeping pace with the famous Moroccan"
3166,A. E. F.,Division and staving longer in the fight--all this had demonstrated
3167,A. E. F.,"that the 1st Division could stand in any company."" In mentioning"
3168,A. E. F.,these facts there is no desire on my part to pretend that this
3169,A. E. F.,"outfit single-handed won the war, because, if I said that, I would"
3170,A. E. F.,be talking sheer nonsense. The consensus of opinion both at home and
3171,A. E. F.,"abroad, seems to be that the whole American Army lived entirely up"
3172,A. E. F.,"to expectations, so that any man who was in a combat division, has"
3173,A. E. F.,"good reason to feel proud of his own division, irrespective of what"
3174,A. E. F.,one that may have been. With this little word of explanation I feel
3175,A. E. F.,at liberty to quote the following which appeared in the Paris

3190,A. E. F.,"within five years, a division such as they had found the First"
3191,A. E. F.,"Division to be. The German, when taken, had seen four years of"
3192,A. E. F.,severe fighting. This is what he had to say yesterday:--
3193,A. E. F.,
3194,A. E. F.,"""I received orders to hold the ground at all costs. The American"
3195,A. E. F.,barrage advanced toward my position and the work of your artillery
3196,A. E. F.,was marvelous. The barrage was so dense that it was impossible for
3197,A. E. F.,us to move out of our dugouts.
3198,A. E. F.,
3199,A. E. F.,"""Following the barrage closely were the troops of the First"
3200,A. E. F.,Division. I saw them forge ahead and knew that all was lost. All
3201,A. E. F.,"night I remained in my dugout, hoping vainly that something would"
3202,A. E. F.,happen that would permit me to rejoin my army. This morning your
3203,A. E. F.,"troops found me and here I am, after four years of fighting, a"
3204,A. E. F.,prisoner.
3205,A. E. F.,
3206,A. E. F.,"""Yesterday, I knew that the First Division was opposite us, and I"
3207,A. E. F.,knew we would have to put up the hardest fight of the war. The First
3208,A. E. F.,Division is wonderful and the German army knows it.
3209,A. E. F.,
3210,A. E. F.,"""We did not believe that within five years the Americans could"
3211,A. E. F.,develop a division such as this First Division. The work of its
3212,A. E. F.,"infantry and artillery is worthy of the best armies of the world."""

3218,A. E. F.,cuff standing for a wound. One wound chevron meant a wound or wounds
3219,A. E. F.,"severe enough to take a man back to the hospital, irrespective of"
3220,A. E. F.,whether he had one or a dozen bullets or pieces of shell in him on

3238,A. E. F.,"and the bread or hardtack, up to the men in the first and second"

3277,A. E. F.,
3278,A. E. F.,While realizing that my personal affairs are of no possible interest to
3279,A. E. F.,"the reader, it would seem, however, almost obligatory for me to do"
3280,A. E. F.,"myself justice, and explain that I was quite willing to shoulder"
3281,A. E. F.,"responsibility, which this poem might make it appear I was not. Hence"
3282,A. E. F.,the following little anecdote:--During a rest period back from the
3283,A. E. F.,"trenches, which was the only occasion when you had time to bother your"
3284,A. E. F.,"head about smaller things, several men had applied for officers'"
3285,A. E. F.,"commissions, so I got some civilian letters of recommendation, and put"
3286,A. E. F.,in an application to be permitted to go up for examination for a
3287,A. E. F.,"commission. This application was forwarded ""approved"" by my company"
3288,A. E. F.,"commander, together with personal recommendations from my three previous"
3289,A. E. F.,"company commanders. As this officer is the one who sees you daily, his"
3290,A. E. F.,"recommendation is, from a military standpoint, of more value than that"
3291,A. E. F.,of a major-general. But in spite of my application being forwarded with
3292,A. E. F.,the approval of all four of the company commanders that I had had up to
3293,A. E. F.,"that time, it was disapproved higher up by someone who very seldom could"
3294,A. E. F.,ever have even seen me. But having had no thought or intention of
3295,A. E. F.,"getting a commission, when I entered the Army, and having crossed over"
3296,A. E. F.,"to Europe as a civilian, at my own expense, in August, 1917, to enlist"
3297,A. E. F.,"in the American Army in France, which I did on September 1st, 1917, in"
3298,A. E. F.,"Paris, so as to absolutely insure getting into the trenches, and as at"
3299,A. E. F.,"the time of my application I had already accomplished my purpose, it may"
3300,A. E. F.,readily be discerned that the return of my application did not perturb
3301,A. E. F.,"the habitual equanimity of my soul, nor cause me to lose any of my"
3302,A. E. F.,natural sleep or youthful charm.

3307,A. E. F.,"While very often some junior, or even senior, officer would fall"
3308,A. E. F.,"under this category, and even worse, the majority of them really"
3309,A. E. F.,tried to give their men a square deal. If an officer were a
3310,A. E. F.,"rough-neck, snob, or as the men in the ranks would usually express"
3311,A. E. F.,"it, a ribbon-counter clerk, it was only quite natural that he would"
3312,A. E. F.,take cowardly advantage of his shoulder straps to make it as
3313,A. E. F.,"miserable as possible for the men under him, but if an officer were"
3314,A. E. F.,"a gentleman in civilian life, the man in the ranks was sure to be"
3315,A. E. F.,"handled as a man and treated fairly, so long as he did his military"
3316,A. E. F.,"duty and conducted himself as a soldier. Of this latter type, I can"
3317,A. E. F.,"look back with pleasure on all my company commanders, remembering"
