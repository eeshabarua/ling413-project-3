132,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,
133,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"Dim, gradual thinning of the shapeless gloom"
134,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,Shudders to drizzling daybreak that reveals
135,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,Disconsolate men who stamp their sodden boots
136,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"And turn dulled, sunken faces to the sky"
137,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"Haggard and hopeless. They, who have beaten down"
138,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"The stale despair of night, must now renew"
139,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"Their desolation in the truce of dawn,"
140,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,Murdering the livid hours that grope for peace.
141,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,
142,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"Yet these, who cling to life with stubborn hands,"
143,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,Can grin through storms of death and find a gap
144,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"In the clawed, cruel tangles of his defence."
145,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"They march from safety, and the bird-sung joy"
146,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"Of grass-green thickets, to the land where all"
147,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"Is ruin, and nothing blossoms but the sky"
148,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,That hastens over them where they endure
149,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"Sad, smoking, flat horizons, reeking woods,"
150,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,And foundered trench-lines volleying doom for doom.
151,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,
152,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"O my brave brown companions, when your souls"
153,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"Flock silently away, and the eyeless dead"
154,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"Shame the wild beast of battle on the ridge,"
155,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,Death will stand grieving in that field of war
156,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,Since your unvanquished hardihood is spent.
157,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,And through some mooned Valhalla there will pass
158,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,"Battalions and battalions, scarred from hell;"
159,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,The unreturning army that was youth;
160,PRELUDE: THE TROOPS,The legions who have suffered and are dust.

167,DREAMERS,
168,DREAMERS,"Soldiers are citizens of death's gray land,"
169,DREAMERS,Drawing no dividend from time's to-morrows;
170,DREAMERS,"In the great hour of destiny they stand,"
171,DREAMERS,"Each with his feuds, and jealousies, and sorrows."
172,DREAMERS,Soldiers are sworn to action; they must win
173,DREAMERS,"Some flaming, fatal climax with their lives."
174,DREAMERS,Soldiers are dreamers; when the guns begin
175,DREAMERS,"They think of firelit homes, clean beds, and wives."
176,DREAMERS,
177,DREAMERS,"I see them in foul dug-outs, gnawed by rats,"
178,DREAMERS,"And in the ruined trenches, lashed with rain,"
179,DREAMERS,"Dreaming of things they did with balls and bats,"
180,DREAMERS,And mocked by hopeless longing to regain
181,DREAMERS,"Bank-holidays, and picture shows, and spats,"
182,DREAMERS,And going to the office in the train.

188,THE REDEEMER,
189,THE REDEEMER,
190,THE REDEEMER,Darkness: the rain sluiced down; the mire was deep;
191,THE REDEEMER,"It was past twelve on a mid-winter night,"
192,THE REDEEMER,When peaceful folk in beds lay snug asleep:
193,THE REDEEMER,"There, with much work to do before the light,"
194,THE REDEEMER,We lugged our clay-sucked boots as best we might
195,THE REDEEMER,"Along the trench; sometimes a bullet sang,"
196,THE REDEEMER,And droning shells burst with a hollow bang;
197,THE REDEEMER,"We were soaked, chilled and wretched, every one."
198,THE REDEEMER,Darkness: the distant wink of a huge gun.
199,THE REDEEMER,
200,THE REDEEMER,"I turned in the black ditch, loathing the storm;"
201,THE REDEEMER,"A rocket fizzed and burned with blanching flare,"
202,THE REDEEMER,And lit the face of what had been a form
203,THE REDEEMER,Floundering in mirk. He stood before me there;
204,THE REDEEMER,"I say that he was Christ; stiff in the glare,"
205,THE REDEEMER,"And leaning forward from his burdening task,"
206,THE REDEEMER,Both arms supporting it; his eyes on mine
207,THE REDEEMER,Stared from the woeful head that seemed a mask
208,THE REDEEMER,Of mortal pain in Hell's unholy shine.
209,THE REDEEMER,
210,THE REDEEMER,"No thorny crown, only a woollen cap"
211,THE REDEEMER,"He wore--an English soldier, white and strong,"
212,THE REDEEMER,"Who loved his time like any simple chap,"
213,THE REDEEMER,Good days of work and sport and homely song;
214,THE REDEEMER,"Now he has learned that nights are very long,"
215,THE REDEEMER,And dawn a watching of the windowed sky.
216,THE REDEEMER,"But to the end, unjudging, he'll endure"
217,THE REDEEMER,"Horror ancf pain, not uncontent to die"
218,THE REDEEMER,That Lancaster on Lune may stand secure.
219,THE REDEEMER,
220,THE REDEEMER,"He faced me, reeling in his weariness,"
221,THE REDEEMER,"Shouldering his load of planks, so hard to bear."
222,THE REDEEMER,"I say that he was Christ, who wrought to bless"
223,THE REDEEMER,"All groping things with freedom bright as air,"
224,THE REDEEMER,And with His mercy washed and made them fair.
225,THE REDEEMER,"Then the flame sank, and all grew black as pitch,"
226,THE REDEEMER,While we began to struggle along the ditch;
227,THE REDEEMER,"And some one flung his burden in the muck,"
228,THE REDEEMER,"Mumbling: ""O Christ Almighty, now I'm stuck!"""

234,TRENCH DUTY,
235,TRENCH DUTY,"Shaken from sleep, and numbed and scarce awake,"
236,TRENCH DUTY,"Out in the trench with three hours' watch to take,"
237,TRENCH DUTY,I blunder through the splashing mirk; and then
238,TRENCH DUTY,Hear the gruff muttering voices of the men
239,TRENCH DUTY,Crouching in cabins candle-chinked with light.
240,TRENCH DUTY,Hark! There's the big bombardment on our right
241,TRENCH DUTY,Rumbling and bumping; and the dark's a glare
242,TRENCH DUTY,Of flickering horror in the sectors where
243,TRENCH DUTY,"We raid the Boche; men waiting, stiff and chilled,"
244,TRENCH DUTY,Or crawling on their bellies through the wire.
245,TRENCH DUTY,"""What? Stretcher-bearers wanted? Some one killed?"""
246,TRENCH DUTY,Five minutes ago I heard a sniper fire:
247,TRENCH DUTY,Why did he do it?... Starlight overhead--
248,TRENCH DUTY,Blank stars. I'm wide-awake; and some chap's dead.

257,WIRERS,"And yawning sentries mumble, ""Wirers going out."""
258,WIRERS,"Unravelling; twisting; hammering stakes with muffled thud,"
259,WIRERS,They toil with stealthy haste and anger in their blood.
260,WIRERS,
261,WIRERS,"The Boche sends up a flare. Black forms stand rigid there,"
262,WIRERS,"Stock-still like posts; then darkness, and the clumsy ghosts"
263,WIRERS,"Stride hither and thither, whispering, tripped by clutching snare"
264,WIRERS,Of snags and tangles.
265,WIRERS,Ghastly dawn with vaporous coasts
266,WIRERS,"Gleams desolate along the sky, night's misery ended."
267,WIRERS,
268,WIRERS,"Young Hughes was badly hit; I heard him carried away,"
269,WIRERS,Moaning at every lurch; no doubt he'll die to-day.
270,WIRERS,But _we_ can say the front-line wire's been safely mended.

275,BREAK OF DAY,BREAK OF DAY
276,BREAK OF DAY,
277,BREAK OF DAY,
278,BREAK OF DAY,There seemed a smell of autumn in the air
279,BREAK OF DAY,At the bleak end of night; he shivered there
280,BREAK OF DAY,"In a dank, musty dug-out where he lay,"
281,BREAK OF DAY,"Legs wrapped in sand-bags,--lumps of chalk and clay"
282,BREAK OF DAY,"Spattering his face. Dry-mouthed, he thought, ""To-day"
283,BREAK OF DAY,"We start the damned attack; and, Lord knows why,"
284,BREAK OF DAY,Zero's at nine; how bloody if I'm done in
285,BREAK OF DAY,"Under the freedom of that morning sky!"""
286,BREAK OF DAY,"And then he coughed and dozed, cursing the din."
287,BREAK OF DAY,
288,BREAK OF DAY,Was it the ghost of autumn in that smell
289,BREAK OF DAY,"Of underground, or God's blank heart grown kind,"
290,BREAK OF DAY,That sent a happy dream to him in hell?--
291,BREAK OF DAY,"Where men are crushed like clods, and crawl to find"
292,BREAK OF DAY,Some crater for their wretchedness; who lie
293,BREAK OF DAY,"In outcast immolation, doomed to die"
294,BREAK OF DAY,"Far from clean things or any hope of cheer,"
295,BREAK OF DAY,"Cowed anger in their eyes, till darkness brims"
296,BREAK OF DAY,"And roars into their heads, and they can hear"
297,BREAK OF DAY,"Old childish talk, and tags of foolish hymns."
298,BREAK OF DAY,
299,BREAK OF DAY,He sniffs the chilly air; (his dreaming starts).
300,BREAK OF DAY,He's riding in a dusty Sussex lane
301,BREAK OF DAY,In quiet September; slowly night departs;
302,BREAK OF DAY,"And he's a living soul, absolved from pain."
303,BREAK OF DAY,Beyond the brambled fences where he goes
304,BREAK OF DAY,"Are glimmering fields with harvest piled in sheaves,"
305,BREAK OF DAY,And tree-tops dark against the stars grown pale;
306,BREAK OF DAY,"Then, clear and shrill, a distant farm-cock crows;"
307,BREAK OF DAY,And there's a wall of mist along the vale
308,BREAK OF DAY,Where willows shake their watery-sounding leaves.
309,BREAK OF DAY,"He gazes on it all, and scarce believes"
310,BREAK OF DAY,That earth is telling its old peaceful tale;
311,BREAK OF DAY,He thanks the blessed world that he was born ...
312,BREAK OF DAY,"Then, far away, a lonely note of the horn."
313,BREAK OF DAY,
314,BREAK OF DAY,"They're drawing the Big Wood! Unlatch the gate,"
315,BREAK OF DAY,And set Golumpus going on the grass:
316,BREAK OF DAY,_He_ knows the corner where it's best to wait
317,BREAK OF DAY,And hear the crashing woodland chorus pass;
318,BREAK OF DAY,The corner where old foxes make their track
319,BREAK OF DAY,To the Long Spinney; that's the place to be.
320,BREAK OF DAY,"The bracken shakes below an ivied tree,"
321,BREAK OF DAY,"And then a cub looks out; and ""Tally-o-back!"""
322,BREAK OF DAY,"He bawls, and swings his thong with volleying crack,--"
323,BREAK OF DAY,"All the clean thrill of autumn in his blood,"
324,BREAK OF DAY,And hunting surging through him like a flood
325,BREAK OF DAY,In joyous welcome from the untroubled past;
326,BREAK OF DAY,"While the war drifts away, forgotten at last."
327,BREAK OF DAY,
328,BREAK OF DAY,"Now a red, sleepy sun above the rim"
329,BREAK OF DAY,"Of twilight stares along the quiet weald,"
330,BREAK OF DAY,"And the kind, simple country shines revealed"
331,BREAK OF DAY,"In solitudes of peace, no longer dim."
332,BREAK OF DAY,"The old horse lifts his face and thanks the light,"
333,BREAK OF DAY,Then stretches down his head to crop the green.
334,BREAK OF DAY,All things that he has loved are in his sight;
335,BREAK OF DAY,The places where his happiness has been
336,BREAK OF DAY,"Are in his eyes, his heart, and they are good."

345,A WORKING PARTY,
346,A WORKING PARTY,"Three hours ago he blundered up the trench,"
347,A WORKING PARTY,"Sliding and poising, groping with his boots;"
348,A WORKING PARTY,Sometimes he tripped and lurched against the walls
349,A WORKING PARTY,With hands that pawed the sodden bags of chalk.
350,A WORKING PARTY,He couldn't see the man who walked in front;
351,A WORKING PARTY,Only he heard the drum and rattle of feet
352,A WORKING PARTY,"Stepping along the trench-boards,--often splashing"
353,A WORKING PARTY,Wretchedly where the sludge was ankle-deep.
354,A WORKING PARTY,
355,A WORKING PARTY,"Voices would grunt, ""Keep to your right,--make way!"""
356,A WORKING PARTY,When squeezing past the men from the front-line:
357,A WORKING PARTY,"White faces peered, puffing a point of red;"
358,A WORKING PARTY,Candles and braziers glinted through the chinks
359,A WORKING PARTY,And curtain-flaps of dug-outs; then the gloom
360,A WORKING PARTY,Swallowed his sense of sight; he stooped and swore
361,A WORKING PARTY,Because a sagging wire had caught his neck.
362,A WORKING PARTY,A flare went up; the shining whiteness spread
363,A WORKING PARTY,"And flickered upward, showing nimble rats,"
364,A WORKING PARTY,"And mounds of glimmering sand-bags, bleached with rain;"
365,A WORKING PARTY,"Then the slow, silver moment died in dark."
366,A WORKING PARTY,
367,A WORKING PARTY,The wind came posting by with chilly gusts
368,A WORKING PARTY,"And buffeting at corners, piping thin"
369,A WORKING PARTY,And dreary through the crannies; rifle-shots
370,A WORKING PARTY,"Would split and crack and sing along the night,"
371,A WORKING PARTY,And shells came calmly through the drizzling air
372,A WORKING PARTY,To burst with hollow bang below the hill.
373,A WORKING PARTY,
374,A WORKING PARTY,Three hours ago he stumbled up the trench;
375,A WORKING PARTY,Now he will never walk that road again:
376,A WORKING PARTY,"He must be carried back, a jolting lump"
377,A WORKING PARTY,Beyond all need of tenderness and care;
378,A WORKING PARTY,A nine-stone corpse with nothing more to do.
379,A WORKING PARTY,
380,A WORKING PARTY,
381,A WORKING PARTY,He was a young man with a meagre wife
382,A WORKING PARTY,And two pale children in a Midland town;
383,A WORKING PARTY,He showed the photograph to all his mates;
384,A WORKING PARTY,And they considered him a decent chap
385,A WORKING PARTY,"Who did his work and hadn't much to say,"
386,A WORKING PARTY,And always laughed at other people's jokes
387,A WORKING PARTY,Because he hadn't any of his own.
388,A WORKING PARTY,
389,A WORKING PARTY,"That night, when he was busy at his job"
390,A WORKING PARTY,"Of piling bags along the parapet,"
391,A WORKING PARTY,"He thought how slow time went, stamping his feet,"
392,A WORKING PARTY,"And blowing on his fingers, pinched with cold."
393,A WORKING PARTY,
394,A WORKING PARTY,"He thought of getting back by half-past twelve,"
395,A WORKING PARTY,"And tot of rum to send him warm to sleep,"
396,A WORKING PARTY,In draughty dug-out frowsty with the fumes
397,A WORKING PARTY,"Of coke, and full of snoring, weary men."
398,A WORKING PARTY,
399,A WORKING PARTY,"He pushed another bag along the top,"
400,A WORKING PARTY,Craning his body outward; then a flare
401,A WORKING PARTY,Gave one white glimpse of No Man's Land and wire;
402,A WORKING PARTY,And as he dropped his head the instant split
403,A WORKING PARTY,"His startled life with lead, and all went out."

414,STAND-TO: GOOD FRIDAY MORNING,"""Stand-to!"" Somebody grunted and swore."
415,STAND-TO: GOOD FRIDAY MORNING,Dawn was misty; the skies were still;

431,IN THE PINK,"So Davies wrote: ""This leaves me in the pink."""
432,IN THE PINK,"Then scrawled his name: ""Your loving sweetheart, Willie."""
433,IN THE PINK,With crosses for a hug. He'd had a drink
434,IN THE PINK,"Of rum and tea; and, though the barn was chilly,"
435,IN THE PINK,For once his blood ran warm; he had pay to spend.

438,IN THE PINK,He couldn't sleep that night. Stiff in the dark
439,IN THE PINK,"He groaned and thought of Sundays at the farm,"
440,IN THE PINK,When he'd go out as cheerful as a lark
441,IN THE PINK,In his best suit to wander arm-in-arm
442,IN THE PINK,"With brown-eyed Gwen, and whisper in her ear"
443,IN THE PINK,"The simple, silly things she liked to hear."

446,IN THE PINK,"Up to the trenches, and my boots are rotten."
447,IN THE PINK,"Five miles of stodgy clay and freezing sludge,"
448,IN THE PINK,And everything but wretchedness forgotten.

1700,II,"Shifting dreams in mazy light,"
1701,II,Somewhere then I'll see your face
1702,II,Turning back to bid me follow
1703,II,"Where I wag my arms and hollo,"
1704,II,Over hedges hasting after
1705,II,"Crooked smile and baffling laughter,"
1706,II,"Running tireless, floating, leaping,"
1707,II,"Down your web-hung woods and valleys,"
1708,II,"Garden glooms and hornbeam alleys,"
1709,II,"Where the glowworm stars are peeping,"
1710,II,"Till I find you, quiet as stone"
1711,II,"On a hill-top all alone,"

1718,III,You and I have walked together
1719,III,In the starving winter weather.
1720,III,We've been glad because we knew
1721,III,Time's too short and friends are few.
1722,III,We've been sad because we missed
1723,III,One whose yellow head was kissed
1724,III,"By the gods, who thought about him"
1725,III,Till they couldn't do without him.
1726,III,Now he's here again; I've seen
1727,III,"Soldier David dressed in green,"
1728,III,Standing in a wood that swings
1729,III,To the madrigal he sings.
1730,III,"He's come back, all mirth and glory,"
1731,III,Like the prince in a fairy story.
1732,III,Winter called him far away;
1733,III,Blossoms bring him home with May.

1739,IV,That you found him decked in blue
1740,IV,Striding up through morning-land
1741,IV,With a cloud on either hand.
1742,IV,"Out in Wales, you'll say, he marches"
1743,IV,Arm-in-arm with oaks and larches;
1744,IV,"Hides all night in hilly nooks,"
1745,IV,Laughs at dawn in tumbling brooks.
1746,IV,"Yet, it's certain, here he teaches"
1747,IV,Outpost-schemes to groups of beeches.
1748,IV,"And I'm sure, as here I stand,"
1749,IV,"That he shines through every land,"
1750,IV,That he sings in every place

1822,THE DEATH-BED,He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped
1823,THE DEATH-BED,"Round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls;"
1824,THE DEATH-BED,"Aqueous like floating rays of amber light,"
1825,THE DEATH-BED,"Soaring and quivering in the wings of sleep,--"
1826,THE DEATH-BED,Silence and safety; and his mortal shore
1827,THE DEATH-BED,"Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death."
1828,THE DEATH-BED,
1829,THE DEATH-BED,Some one was holding water to his mouth.
1830,THE DEATH-BED,"He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped"
1831,THE DEATH-BED,Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot
1832,THE DEATH-BED,The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.
1833,THE DEATH-BED,"Water--calm, sliding green above the weir;"
1834,THE DEATH-BED,"Water--a sky-lit alley for his boat,"
1835,THE DEATH-BED,"Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers"
1836,THE DEATH-BED,"And shaken hues of summer: drifting down,"
1837,THE DEATH-BED,"He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept."
1838,THE DEATH-BED,
1839,THE DEATH-BED,"Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,"
1840,THE DEATH-BED,Blowing the curtain to a glimmering curve.
1841,THE DEATH-BED,Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars
1842,THE DEATH-BED,Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;
1843,THE DEATH-BED,"Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,"
1844,THE DEATH-BED,Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.
1845,THE DEATH-BED,
1846,THE DEATH-BED,Rain; he could hear it rustling through the dark;
1847,THE DEATH-BED,Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;
1848,THE DEATH-BED,Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers
1849,THE DEATH-BED,That soak the woods; not the harsh rain that sweeps
1850,THE DEATH-BED,"Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace"

1857,THE DEATH-BED,His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.
1858,THE DEATH-BED,But some one was beside him; soon he lay
1859,THE DEATH-BED,Shuddering because that evil thing had passed.
1860,THE DEATH-BED,"And Death, who'd stepped toward him, paused and stared."

1866,THE DEATH-BED,When cruel old campaigners win safe through?
1867,THE DEATH-BED,
1868,THE DEATH-BED,"But Death replied: ""I choose him."" So he went,"
1869,THE DEATH-BED,And there was silence in the summer night;
