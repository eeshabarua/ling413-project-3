21,BY THE SAME AUTHOR,“The secret of Mr. Harvey’s power is that he says what other English
22,BY THE SAME AUTHOR,lads in Flanders want to say and cannot.... This modest little
23,BY THE SAME AUTHOR,"volume has real charm, and not a little depth of thought and beauty."
24,BY THE SAME AUTHOR,It contains far more real poetry than many a volume ten times its
25,BY THE SAME AUTHOR,length.”--Bishop Frodsham in _The Saturday Review_.

27,BY THE SAME AUTHOR,“A poet of power and a subtle distinction.... This little collection

201,INTRODUCTION,
202,INTRODUCTION,“Good wine needs no bush.” Those who know and love “A Gloucestershire
203,INTRODUCTION,Lad” would resent any lengthy attempt to praise the quality of
204,INTRODUCTION,Lieutenant Harvey’s verses. Some of the poems from a German prison
205,INTRODUCTION,camp may reach a far higher standard of lyric excellence than any in
206,INTRODUCTION,the earlier volume. The two ballades on war and “The Bugler” grip one
207,INTRODUCTION,by the throat. But all the verses have a sweetness and beauty entirely
208,INTRODUCTION,their own.
209,INTRODUCTION,
210,INTRODUCTION,The poems are all short--too short. Lieutenant Harvey sings like the
211,INTRODUCTION,wild birds of his own dear Gloucestershire because he cannot help doing
212,INTRODUCTION,so. He stops short--as they do--and like them begins again. What can
213,INTRODUCTION,"we do but take what he gives us, wondering that he can write so well,"
214,INTRODUCTION,mewed as he is in a cage--and such a cage! An agony of inarticulate
215,INTRODUCTION,longing shrills in a feathered cageling’s song: the man simply and
216,INTRODUCTION,"unaffectedly lays bare his heart, his love, his faith, his hope, his"
217,INTRODUCTION,"sense of loneliness, of ineffectiveness, of baffled purposes and"
218,INTRODUCTION,incompleted manhood.

222,INTRODUCTION,"makes some hopeless and weak, others bitter and savage, according to"
223,INTRODUCTION,their natures. Beneath all the music of this man’s words there is an
224,INTRODUCTION,"undertone of fierce anger that sweeps him away at times, but is this"
225,INTRODUCTION,"not characteristic of many other young Englishmen who laugh so well,"
226,INTRODUCTION,and “woo bright danger for a thrilling kiss”? His memories sweep along
227,INTRODUCTION,"the great gamut of his own tremendous experiences, and yet they never"
228,INTRODUCTION,lose the melodies of home. Perhaps because of the objects of his
229,INTRODUCTION,"heart’s desire he is so kindly withal, so modest, so humorous, and, to"
230,INTRODUCTION,"use his own words of another, “so worldly foolish, so divinely wise.”"
231,INTRODUCTION,Herein is the fascination of these verses.
232,INTRODUCTION,
233,INTRODUCTION,The manuscript was sent on by the prison authorities of Crefeld without
234,INTRODUCTION,any obliteration or excision. This must be counted unto them for
235,INTRODUCTION,literary righteousness. Yet it would be difficult to imagine what the
236,INTRODUCTION,most stony-hearted German censor could resent in any one of Lieutenant
237,INTRODUCTION,"Harvey’s poems, unless it might be a deep love for England and an"
238,INTRODUCTION,overwhelming desire to be with his love again.
239,INTRODUCTION,
240,INTRODUCTION,"Many unfortunates who have had dear ones imprisoned at Gütersloh, where"
241,INTRODUCTION,"most of these poems were written, and at other centres, are looking"
242,INTRODUCTION,forward eagerly to the publication of this little book. If they expect
243,INTRODUCTION,"to read descriptions of the life of the camp, or reflections upon the"
244,INTRODUCTION,"conduct of German gaolers, they will be disappointed. The circumstances"
245,INTRODUCTION,of the case have made such revelations impossible. If they had been
246,INTRODUCTION,"possible, it is still doubtful if they would have been made here. But"
247,INTRODUCTION,it will be strange if such readers do not find better things than they
248,INTRODUCTION,"expected. Transpose any other county of this land for Gloucestershire,"
249,INTRODUCTION,"or any other home for the tree-encircled house at Minsterworth,"
250,INTRODUCTION,then they will learn what the best of England’s captive sons are
251,INTRODUCTION,"thinking, and so take heart of grace from the true love-songs of a"
252,INTRODUCTION,"Gloucestershire soldier, written first and foremost for his mother."

1461,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,"Like some great owl it hoots, and then it flies"
1462,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,"Past, and is swallowed up in dusk. And, singing,"
1463,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,A country girl with basket homeward wends
1464,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,--Sweet as the dusty roses that are clinging
1465,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,Around the cottage where her journey ends.
1466,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,
1467,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,"Night deepens, and the stars with strengthening rays"
1468,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,Thicken and go upon their lovely ways.
1469,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,Where are the voices that have vexed us so?
1470,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,"Dear God, how quiet has Thy day become!"
1471,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,"The clamorous tongues of Earth are smitten dumb,"
1472,ON OVER BRIDGE AT EVENING,Awed with the beauty that Thy work doth show.

1481,PASSION,In holy ecstasy
1482,PASSION,"’Midst whir of angel-wings,"

1490,PASSION,That live indeed:
1491,PASSION,"Joyance of sword or pen,"
1492,PASSION,"High thought or deed,"
1493,PASSION,Are in such primal fashion
1494,PASSION,Contrived and wrought.

1508,A COMMON PETITION,This only grant to me:
1509,A COMMON PETITION,

1511,A COMMON PETITION,Of Life--be man alive:
1512,A COMMON PETITION,Yet through no body’s blunder
1513,A COMMON PETITION,To drag the bright soul under
1514,A COMMON PETITION,--Drowned where it needs must dive.

1528,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,Unutterable weariness
1529,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,Of blood and brain--
1530,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,Intolerable dreariness
1531,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,Of days God gave me.
1532,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,And I bethought
1533,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,"The first fresh flood of youth that rose to leave me,"
1534,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,And how in those brave days--
1535,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,Virgin of lust and spot--
1536,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,I had forgot
1537,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,To render any praise.
1538,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,"Then, as I thus looked upward through the net"

1541,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,The flowers to birth!)
1542,AN ADVENTURE WITH GOD,Smiled down and did restore

1549,THE STRANGER,
1550,THE STRANGER,
1551,THE STRANGER,It happened in a blood-red hell ringed round with golden weather;
1552,THE STRANGER,"Walking in khaki through a trench he came,"
1553,THE STRANGER,"When life was death, and wounded men and great shells screamed"
1554,THE STRANGER,together:
1555,THE STRANGER,I did not know his name.
1556,THE STRANGER,"But so white-faced and wan, we talked a little while together"
1557,THE STRANGER,"Amongst dead men, and timbers black with flame."
1558,THE STRANGER,
1559,THE STRANGER,"“What would you do with life again,” asks he, “if one could give it?”"
1560,THE STRANGER,"“No use to talk when life is done,” I say."
1561,THE STRANGER,"“But, by the living God, if He should grant me life I’d live it"
1562,THE STRANGER,"Kinder to man, truer to God each day.”"
1563,THE STRANGER,
1564,THE STRANGER,"Flame and the noise of doom devoured the words, and for a while"
1565,THE STRANGER,"Senseless I lay.... Then,"
1566,THE STRANGER,"Oh, then as in a dream I saw the stranger with a smile"
1567,THE STRANGER,Moving towards me over the dead men.
1568,THE STRANGER,
1569,THE STRANGER,"Red, red were his hands and feet and a great hole in his side,"
1570,THE STRANGER,Yet glory seemed to blaze about his head;
1571,THE STRANGER,"“Kinder to man, truer to God,” he whispered, and then died;"
1572,THE STRANGER,"Falling down, arms outspread."
1573,THE STRANGER,"Ere darkness fell upon me with the faintness and the pain,"
1574,THE STRANGER,I saw a mangled body lying prone
1575,THE STRANGER,Upon the earth beside me. But what I can’t explain
1576,THE STRANGER,Is--_The stretcher-bearers found me quite alone_.
1577,THE STRANGER,
1578,THE STRANGER,"But, howsoe’er it happened, it matters not at last,"
1579,THE STRANGER,Since God’s dear Son came down to earth and died
1580,THE STRANGER,"In bloodshed, and the darkness of clouds that groaned aghast;"
1581,THE STRANGER,With pierced hands and a great wound in His side.
1582,THE STRANGER,
1583,THE STRANGER,It is not in my heart to hate the pleasant sins I leave.
1584,THE STRANGER,Earth’s passion flames within me fierce and strong.
1585,THE STRANGER,But this is like a shadow ever rising up to thieve
1586,THE STRANGER,"Sin’s pleasures, and the lure of every pattern lust can weave,"
1587,THE STRANGER,And charm of all things that can do Him wrong.

1596,THE BUGLER,"Then, having firmly shut"
1597,THE BUGLER,"Life like a precious metal in his fist,"
1598,THE BUGLER,"Withdrew, His labour done. Thus did begin"
1599,THE BUGLER,Our various divinity and sin.
1600,THE BUGLER,"For some to ploughshares did the metal twist,"
1601,THE BUGLER,And others--dreaming empires--straightway cut
1602,THE BUGLER,Crowns for their aching foreheads. Others beat
1603,THE BUGLER,Long nails and heavy hammers for the feet
1604,THE BUGLER,Of their forgotten Lord. (Who dare to boast
1605,THE BUGLER,That he is guiltless?) Others coined it: most
1606,THE BUGLER,"Did with it--simply nothing. (Here, again,"
1607,THE BUGLER,Who cries his innocence?) Yet doth remain
1608,THE BUGLER,"Metal unmarred, to each man more or less,"
1609,THE BUGLER,Whereof to fashion perfect loveliness.
1610,THE BUGLER,
1611,THE BUGLER,"For me, I do but bear within my hand"
1612,THE BUGLER,"(For sake of Him our Lord, now long forsaken)"
1613,THE BUGLER,A simple bugle such as may awaken
1614,THE BUGLER,With one high morning note a drowsing man:
1615,THE BUGLER,That wheresoe’er within my motherland
1616,THE BUGLER,"The sound may come, ’twill echo far and wide"
1617,THE BUGLER,"Like pipes of battle calling up a clan,"
1618,THE BUGLER,Trumpeting men through beauty to God’s side.
