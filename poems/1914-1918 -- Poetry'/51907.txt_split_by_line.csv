67,FOREWORD,
68,FOREWORD,
69,FOREWORD,"THESE poems, by a writer for whom I have literary hopes, belong very"
70,FOREWORD,clearly to that new and vigorous type of poetry which has sprung from
71,FOREWORD,the stress of the last few years and has its root in things done and
72,FOREWORD,suffered rather than in things merely imagined.
73,FOREWORD,
74,FOREWORD,Until lately our very belief in the saying that the poet is born and not
75,FOREWORD,made proved that we had completely accepted poetry as coming only from
76,FOREWORD,"within, spun, as it were, out of our inner consciousness, and either"
77,FOREWORD,"quite unhelped, or else only partially helped, by active experiences"
78,FOREWORD,"from without. We have always understood, of course, that such an"
79,FOREWORD,"experience as, for instance, the sudden flashing upon us of a magnetic"
80,FOREWORD,face as a stranger passes in the street might set aglow a train of
81,FOREWORD,"thought that would quicken and melt into feeling, and the feeling would,"
82,FOREWORD,"in turn, need--and find--expression in poetry."
83,FOREWORD,
84,FOREWORD,So far as this we have admitted that outward occurrences in the course
85,FOREWORD,of our quickly flying days can become a source of poetical inspiration.
86,FOREWORD,"But, in spite of the pointing finger of Kipling, most of us clung"
87,FOREWORD,desperately to the verse that had its sole origin in imaginative emotion
88,FOREWORD,until the blaze of war in the world illumined our souls and showed all
89,FOREWORD,of us that out of our simplest practical work can be struck sparks of
90,FOREWORD,real and great and rare divine fire.
91,FOREWORD,
92,FOREWORD,All the poems in this little book are the outcome of things very deeply
93,FOREWORD,felt. It is very difficult for me to write of them because where there
94,FOREWORD,"is pain uttered in them, it has almost always been my pain as well as"
95,FOREWORD,the author’s. One or two of the sonnets condense the expression of
96,FOREWORD,"losses that have meant a life’s upheaval. One or two, again, are"
97,FOREWORD,practically a concrete record of simple human things observed and
98,FOREWORD,suffered and of duty strenuously done. Here there is no leisured
99,FOREWORD,"dreaming, but sheer experience, solid and stored up, like the honey that"
100,FOREWORD,a bee’s labour has stored.
101,FOREWORD,
102,FOREWORD,"But this practical quality, while it has so much that makes it rich and"
103,FOREWORD,"valuable, has also the one conspicuous disadvantage that the work is"
104,FOREWORD,often done under conditions of strain and turmoil that tell against
105,FOREWORD,perfection of method. Some of these _Verses of a V.A.D._ were written in
106,FOREWORD,almost breathless intervals of severe and devoted duty. The poem
107,FOREWORD,entitled “The German Ward” is especially an example of this. In such
108,FOREWORD,"circumstances, it is difficult to achieve any literary ornamentation and"
109,FOREWORD,least of all that particular kind of simpleness which is the highest
110,FOREWORD,"form of finished art. In the case of several of the poems, both these"
111,FOREWORD,"qualities have been achieved; yet, because of the difficulties, I make"
112,FOREWORD,an appeal for considerateness and tender sympathy in judging these first
113,FOREWORD,shy flowers of the heart and mind of a young girl who has worked
114,FOREWORD,unceasingly and self-forgettingly for the good of others since the days
115,FOREWORD,"of stress began, and who in her personal destiny has suffered as, I"
116,FOREWORD,"hope, very few have suffered."

397,MAY MORNING,(_Note._--At Oxford on May 1st a Latin hymn is sung at sunrise by the
398,MAY MORNING,Magdalen choristers from the top of the tower.)
399,MAY MORNING,
400,MAY MORNING,
401,MAY MORNING,"THE rising sun shone warmly on the tower,"
402,MAY MORNING,Into the clear pure Heaven the hymn aspired
403,MAY MORNING,Piercingly sweet. This was the morning hour
404,MAY MORNING,"When life awoke with Spring’s creative power,"
405,MAY MORNING,And the old City’s grey to gold was fired.
406,MAY MORNING,
407,MAY MORNING,Silently reverent stood the noisy throng;
408,MAY MORNING,Under the bridge the boats in long array
409,MAY MORNING,Lay motionless. The choristers’ far song
410,MAY MORNING,Faded upon the breeze in echoes long.
411,MAY MORNING,Swiftly I left the bridge and rode away.
412,MAY MORNING,
413,MAY MORNING,"Straight to a little wood’s green heart I sped,"
414,MAY MORNING,"Where cowslips grew, beneath whose gold withdrawn"
415,MAY MORNING,The fragrant earth peeped warm and richly red;
416,MAY MORNING,"All trace of Winter’s chilling touch had fled,"
417,MAY MORNING,And song-birds ushered in the year’s bright morn.
418,MAY MORNING,
419,MAY MORNING,"I had met Love not many days before,"
420,MAY MORNING,And as in blissful mood I listening lay
421,MAY MORNING,None ever had of joy so full a store.
422,MAY MORNING,"I thought that Spring must last for evermore,"
423,MAY MORNING,"For I was young and loved, and it was May."

427,MAY MORNING,"Now it is May again, and sweetly clear"
428,MAY MORNING,Perhaps once more aspires the Latin hymn
429,MAY MORNING,"From Magdalen tower, but not for me to hear."
430,MAY MORNING,"I toil far distant, for a darker year"
431,MAY MORNING,Shadows the century with menace grim.
432,MAY MORNING,
433,MAY MORNING,"I walk in ways where pain and sorrow dwell,"
434,MAY MORNING,"And ruin such as only War can bring,"
435,MAY MORNING,"Where each lives through his individual hell,"
436,MAY MORNING,"Fraught with remembered horror none can tell,"
437,MAY MORNING,And no more is there glory in the Spring.
438,MAY MORNING,
439,MAY MORNING,"And I am worn with tears, for he I loved"
440,MAY MORNING,Lies cold beneath the stricken sod of France;
441,MAY MORNING,"Hope has forsaken me, by Death removed,"
442,MAY MORNING,And Love that seemed so strong and gay has proved
443,MAY MORNING,"A poor crushed thing, the toy of cruel Chance."
444,MAY MORNING,
445,MAY MORNING,"Often I wonder, as I grieve in vain,"
446,MAY MORNING,"If when the long, long future years creep slow,"
447,MAY MORNING,"And War and tears alike have ceased to reign,"
448,MAY MORNING,"I ever shall recapture, once again,"
449,MAY MORNING,"The mood of that May morning, long ago."
