74,FOREWORD,
75,FOREWORD,For those who were chiefly in my heart when these verses came to me
76,FOREWORD,"from time to time--our men and boys at the Front, and those they leave"
77,FOREWORD,behind them in grievous sorrow and anxiety at home--my little message
78,FOREWORD,"is that, so far as they are concerned--""ALL'S WELL!"""
79,FOREWORD,
80,FOREWORD,"Those who have so nobly responded to the Call, and those who, with"
81,FOREWORD,"quiet faces and breaking hearts, have so bravely bidden them ""God"
82,FOREWORD,"speed!""--with these, All is truly Well, for they are equally giving"
83,FOREWORD,"their best to what, in this case, we most of us devoutly believe to be"
84,FOREWORD,the service of God and humanity.
85,FOREWORD,
86,FOREWORD,"War is red horror.  But, better war than the utter crushing-out of"
87,FOREWORD,liberty and civilisation under the heel of Prussian or _any other_
88,FOREWORD,militarism.
89,FOREWORD,
90,FOREWORD,"Germany has avowedly outmarched Christianity and left it in the rear,"
91,FOREWORD,"along with its outclassed guns and higher ideals of, say, 1870, its"
92,FOREWORD,"honour, its humanity, and all the other lumber, useless to an"
93,FOREWORD,absolutely materialistic people whose only object is to win the world
94,FOREWORD,even at the price of its soul.
95,FOREWORD,
96,FOREWORD,"The world is witnessing with abhorrence the results, and, we may surely"
97,FOREWORD,"hope, learning therefrom The Final Lesson for its own future guidance."
98,FOREWORD,
99,FOREWORD,"The war-cloud still hangs over us--as I write, but, grim as it is,"
100,FOREWORD,there are not lacking gleams of its silver linings.  If war brings out
101,FOREWORD,the very worst in human nature it offers opportunity also for the
102,FOREWORD,"display of the very best.  And, thank God, proofs of this are not"
103,FOREWORD,"wanting among us, and it is better to let one's thought range the light"
104,FOREWORD,rather than the darkness.
105,FOREWORD,
106,FOREWORD,What the future holds for us no man may safely say.  Mighty changes
107,FOREWORD,without a doubt.  May they all be for the better!  But if that is to be
108,FOREWORD,"it must be the work of every one amongst us.  In this, as in everything"
109,FOREWORD,"else, each one of us helps or hinders, makes or mars."
110,FOREWORD,
111,FOREWORD,"If, in some of these verses, I have endeavoured to strike a note of"
112,FOREWORD,"warning, it is because the times, and the times that are coming, call"
113,FOREWORD,for it.  May it be heeded!
114,FOREWORD,
115,FOREWORD,That the end of the present world-strife must and will mark also the
116,FOREWORD,end of the most monstrous tyranny and the most hideous conception of
117,FOREWORD,"""Kultur"" the world has ever seen, no man for one moment doubts."
118,FOREWORD,
119,FOREWORD,But that is not an end but a beginning.  Unless on the ashes of the
120,FOREWORD,"past we build to nobler purpose, all our gallant dead will have been"
121,FOREWORD,"thrown away, all this gigantic effort, with all its inevitable horror"
122,FOREWORD,"and loss, will have been in vain."
123,FOREWORD,
124,FOREWORD,"It rests with each one among us to say that that shall not be,--that"
125,FOREWORD,"the future shall repair the past,--that out of this holocaust of death"
126,FOREWORD,shall come new life.
127,FOREWORD,
128,FOREWORD,"It behoves every one of us, each in his and her own sphere, and each in"
129,FOREWORD,"his and her own way, to strive with heart and soul for that mighty end."

412,THE CROSS STILL STANDS!,"()""In the evening I went for a walk to a village lately shelled by"
413,THE CROSS STILL STANDS!,German heavy guns.  Their effect was awful--ghastly.  It was impossible
414,THE CROSS STILL STANDS!,to imagine the amount of damage done until one really saw it.  The
415,THE CROSS STILL STANDS!,church was terrible too.  The spire was sticking upside down in the
416,THE CROSS STILL STANDS!,ground a short distance from the door.  The church itself was a mass of
417,THE CROSS STILL STANDS!,debris.  Scarcely anything was left unhit.  In the churchyard again the
418,THE CROSS STILL STANDS!,destruction was terrific--tombstones thrown all over the place.  But
419,THE CROSS STILL STANDS!,the most noticeable thing of all was that the three Crucifixes--one
420,THE CROSS STILL STANDS!,inside and two outside--were untouched!  How they can have avoided the
421,THE CROSS STILL STANDS!,shelling is quite beyond me.  It was a wonderful sight though an awful

2486,(AN ALLEGORY),
2487,(AN ALLEGORY),"One day, as I travelled the highway alone,"
2488,(AN ALLEGORY),"I heard, on in front, a most dolorous groan;"
2489,(AN ALLEGORY),"And there, round the corner, a weary old ass"
2490,(AN ALLEGORY),Was nuzzling the hedge for a mouthful of grass.
2491,(AN ALLEGORY),The load that he carried was piled up so high
2492,(AN ALLEGORY),That it blocked half the road and threatened the sky.
2493,(AN ALLEGORY),"Indeed, of himself I could see but a scrap,"
2494,(AN ALLEGORY),And expected each minute to see that go snap;
2495,(AN ALLEGORY),"For beneath all his load I could see but his legs,"
2496,(AN ALLEGORY),And they were as thin as the thinnest clothes-pegs.
2497,(AN ALLEGORY),
2498,(AN ALLEGORY),"I said, ""O most gentle and innocent beast,"
2499,(AN ALLEGORY),"Say,--why is your burden so greatly increased?"
2500,(AN ALLEGORY),"Who loads you like this, beyond reason and right?"
2501,(AN ALLEGORY),"Is it done for a purpose, or just out of spite?"
2502,(AN ALLEGORY),"Is it all your own treasures you have in your pack,"
2503,(AN ALLEGORY),That crumples your backbone and makes your ribs crack?
2504,(AN ALLEGORY),"It is really too much for an old ass's back."""
2505,(AN ALLEGORY),
2506,(AN ALLEGORY),"""Treasures!""--he groaned, through a lump of chewed grass,"
2507,(AN ALLEGORY),"""_Are_ they treasures?  I don't know.  I'm only the ass"
2508,(AN ALLEGORY),That carries whatever they all like to pack
2509,(AN ALLEGORY),"On my load, without thought of my ribs or my back."
2510,(AN ALLEGORY),"I know there are heaps of things there that I hate,"
2511,(AN ALLEGORY),"But it's always been so.  I guess it's my fate."""
2512,(AN ALLEGORY),"And he flicked his long ears, and switched his thin tail,"
2513,(AN ALLEGORY),And rasped his rough neck with a hinder-foot nail.
2514,(AN ALLEGORY),
2515,(AN ALLEGORY),"""There are fighting-men somewhere up there, and some fools,"
2516,(AN ALLEGORY),And talking-men--heaps--who have quitted their stools
2517,(AN ALLEGORY),"To manage the state and direct its affairs,"
2518,(AN ALLEGORY),"And see, I suppose, that we all get our shares,--"
2519,(AN ALLEGORY),"And ladies and lords, and their offspring and heirs,"
2520,(AN ALLEGORY),"And their flunkeys and toadies, and merchants and wares.--"
2521,(AN ALLEGORY),"And parsons and lawyers,--O heaps,--in that box,"
2522,(AN ALLEGORY),"And big folk and small folk, and all kinds of crocks."
2523,(AN ALLEGORY),
2524,(AN ALLEGORY),"""_That mighty big bale_?--Poison, that,--for the people;"
2525,(AN ALLEGORY),Whatever else lacks they must still have their tipple.
2526,(AN ALLEGORY),"That's The Trade, don't you know, that no one can shackle,--"
2527,(AN ALLEGORY),"'Vested Int'rests,' they call it, and that kind of cackle."
2528,(AN ALLEGORY),"Why the Bishops themselves dare not tackle the tipple,"
2529,(AN ALLEGORY),"For it props up the church and at times builds a steeple."""
2530,(AN ALLEGORY),
2531,(AN ALLEGORY),"(A strangely ingenuous old ass, you perceive,"
2532,(AN ALLEGORY),Whom any shrewd rascal could easily deceive.)
2533,(AN ALLEGORY),
2534,(AN ALLEGORY),"""_That other big bale_?--What I said,--fighting things,--"
2535,(AN ALLEGORY),"Ammunition and guns and these new things with wings,"
2536,(AN ALLEGORY),"O yes, they bulk big, but we need them,--for why?--"
2537,(AN ALLEGORY),"If we hadn't as much as the others have--why,"
2538,(AN ALLEGORY),They say we might just as well lie down and die.
2539,(AN ALLEGORY),
2540,(AN ALLEGORY),"""_Yon big bale on top_?--Ah!  that is a big weight."
2541,(AN ALLEGORY),And that's just the one of the lot I most hate.
2542,(AN ALLEGORY),"That's Capital, that is,--and landlords and such;"
2543,(AN ALLEGORY),And there seems to me sometimes a bit over-much
2544,(AN ALLEGORY),"In that bale.  But there,--I'm perhaps wrong again,"
2545,(AN ALLEGORY),Such matters are outside an old ass's ken.
2546,(AN ALLEGORY),
2547,(AN ALLEGORY),"""_My fodder_?  Oh well, you see,--no room for that."
2548,(AN ALLEGORY),"I pick as I go, and no chance to get fat."
2549,(AN ALLEGORY),"That poison bulks large,--and the landlords, you see;--"
2550,(AN ALLEGORY),And that Capital's heavy as heavy can be.
2551,(AN ALLEGORY),"Some one's bound to go short, and of course that one's ME."""
2552,(AN ALLEGORY),
2553,(AN ALLEGORY),"He kicked up one heel with a snort of disgust,"
2554,(AN ALLEGORY),"And--sudden as though by a giant hand thrust,"
2555,(AN ALLEGORY),"The top-heavy pack on his lean back revolved,"
2556,(AN ALLEGORY),"Came crashing to earth, and in fragments dissolved."
2557,(AN ALLEGORY),
2558,(AN ALLEGORY),"Much surprised,--the old ass, thus set free from his load,"
2559,(AN ALLEGORY),"Picked out a soft spot in the nice dusty road,"
2560,(AN ALLEGORY),"And laid him down on it and rolled in high glee,"
2561,(AN ALLEGORY),"And, as he kicked this way and that, said to me,--"
2562,(AN ALLEGORY),
2563,(AN ALLEGORY),"""Say, Man, I have never enjoyed such a roll"
2564,(AN ALLEGORY),"Since the day I was born, a silly young foal."
2565,(AN ALLEGORY),"Seems to me, if I'd had half the sense of an ass,"
2566,(AN ALLEGORY),I'd have long since got rid of that troublesome mass.
2567,(AN ALLEGORY),"But now that it's down, why--down it shall stop."
2568,(AN ALLEGORY),"All my life's been down under, but now I'm on top."""
2569,(AN ALLEGORY),
2570,(AN ALLEGORY),"Then he came right-side up, pranced about on his load,"
2571,(AN ALLEGORY),And kicked it to pieces all over the road.
2572,(AN ALLEGORY),
2573,(AN ALLEGORY),"And what all this means, I really can't say."
2574,(AN ALLEGORY),"It may not mean much.  But--again,--why, it may."
