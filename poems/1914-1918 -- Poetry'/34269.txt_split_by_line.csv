700,A CONFERENCE,
701,A CONFERENCE,
702,A CONFERENCE,"I was sleeping in the barracks,"
703,A CONFERENCE,A week or so ago.
704,A CONFERENCE,And in the midst of pleasant dreams
705,A CONFERENCE,I heard the whistle blow.
706,A CONFERENCE,
707,A CONFERENCE,"Lord, how I hate those whistles!"
708,A CONFERENCE,"Well, it was time to ""rouse,"""
709,A CONFERENCE,So we marched down 'mongst the thistles
710,A CONFERENCE,Beside the old ice house.
711,A CONFERENCE,
712,A CONFERENCE,"I looked around in misery,"
713,A CONFERENCE,"At last I took a seat,"
714,A CONFERENCE,With nothing to lean up against
715,A CONFERENCE,And no place for my feet.
716,A CONFERENCE,
717,A CONFERENCE,As I sat there in the drizzle
718,A CONFERENCE,"Of a good old Plattsburg rain,"
719,A CONFERENCE,I wondered if I'd fizzle
720,A CONFERENCE,The lesson once again.
721,A CONFERENCE,
722,A CONFERENCE,"The captain, who, like Nero"
723,A CONFERENCE,"Observing Rome in flames,"
724,A CONFERENCE,Was seated on a packing-box
725,A CONFERENCE,Perusing all the names.
726,A CONFERENCE,
727,A CONFERENCE,"""Mr. Whitney, won't you tell us"
728,A CONFERENCE,Of patrols both front and rear?
729,A CONFERENCE,"Speak up, Mr. Whitney,"
730,A CONFERENCE,"So the men in back can hear."""
731,A CONFERENCE,
732,A CONFERENCE,"""And please now, Mr. Warnock,"
733,A CONFERENCE,Just tell us if you will
734,A CONFERENCE,What you'd do with this problem
735,A CONFERENCE,"If you were Sergeant Hill?"""
736,A CONFERENCE,
737,A CONFERENCE,"""No! I'll ask you if I want you;"
738,A CONFERENCE,Never mind the hands.
739,A CONFERENCE,"Warnock, _you_ are Sergeant Hill,"
740,A CONFERENCE,"Just call out your commands."""
741,A CONFERENCE,
742,A CONFERENCE,"""Whitney! Warnock! Gee, what luck!"""
743,A CONFERENCE,I chortled in my glee.
744,A CONFERENCE,"My name is Brown, t'was very plain"
745,A CONFERENCE,He'd never get to me.
746,A CONFERENCE,
747,A CONFERENCE,So I listened to the questions
748,A CONFERENCE,"And the answers one by one,"
749,A CONFERENCE,And wondered if that 3rd degree
750,A CONFERENCE,Was ever to be done.
751,A CONFERENCE,
752,A CONFERENCE,"I thought of cups with handles on,"
753,A CONFERENCE,Of napkins and clean hands;
754,A CONFERENCE,I thought of all the pretty girls
755,A CONFERENCE,That live in _Christian_ lands.
756,A CONFERENCE,
757,A CONFERENCE,"I thought of cakes, and pies, and things,"
758,A CONFERENCE,"I thought of home in pain,"
759,A CONFERENCE,And wondered if I'd ever sleep
760,A CONFERENCE,Till 9 o'clock again.
761,A CONFERENCE,
762,A CONFERENCE,I wished I had some lager beer
763,A CONFERENCE,Or a nice silver fizz;
764,A CONFERENCE,"When, ""Mr. Brown, you tell us"
765,A CONFERENCE,"What a special order is."""
766,A CONFERENCE,
767,A CONFERENCE,"I rose, saluted, brushed my pants"
768,A CONFERENCE,Then mutely gazed around.
769,A CONFERENCE,I stood transfixed; the Captain said
770,A CONFERENCE,"""_Sit down, Mr. Brown!_"""

788,SUNDAY IN BARRACKS,What becomes of them on Sunday?
789,SUNDAY IN BARRACKS,Dinners ... the beauty of women ...
790,SUNDAY IN BARRACKS,Pretty talk.
791,SUNDAY IN BARRACKS,"Camaraderie beside the lake ... fellow for fellow,"

793,SUNDAY IN BARRACKS,My little silences slide along the floor ...
794,SUNDAY IN BARRACKS,Clamber up my bunk
795,SUNDAY IN BARRACKS,To grin at me in my loneliness.
796,SUNDAY IN BARRACKS,Then I think of the millions
797,SUNDAY IN BARRACKS,"Who have none for whom to be lonely,"
798,SUNDAY IN BARRACKS,"French, English, German, Russ...."
799,SUNDAY IN BARRACKS,What does it matter the language?

814,I,
815,I,Since we came to Plattsburg Training Camp
816,I,"Upon the 12th of May,"
817,I,A lot of clever candidates
818,I,Have fallen by the way;
819,I,But the strangest fall among them all
820,I,Was Montmorency Gray.
821,I,
822,I,
823,II,II
824,II,
825,II,"Monty was a clever lad,"
826,II,As bright as bright could be;
827,II,He came up days ahead of time--
828,II,Ahead of you and me--
829,II,And got in strong right from the start.
830,II,O a clever lad was he!
831,II,
832,II,
833,III,III
834,III,
835,III,For Monty was an Officer
836,III,Of Uncle Sam's Reserve;
837,III,His uniform was spic and span
838,III,In every line and curve;
839,III,"And what he lacked in other things,"
840,III,He made up for in nerve.
841,III,
842,III,
843,IV,IV
844,IV,
845,IV,He learned the I.D.R. by heart
846,IV,Before the 1st of June;
847,IV,"He used to study late at night,"
848,IV,And in the morning soon;
849,IV,No wonder that the Captain let him
850,IV,Lead the 1st Platoon.
851,IV,
852,IV,
853,V,V
854,V,
855,V,He asked the cutest questions
856,V,In the study hall at night;
857,V,He knew the difference between
858,V,A Cut and Fill at sight.
859,V,"And when it said: ""What do you do?"""
860,V,He always did just right.
861,V,
862,V,
863,VI,VI
864,VI,
865,VI,He memorized the map from
866,VI,Chestnut Hill to Steven's Run;
867,VI,"He didn't have to draw a scale,"
868,VI,As we have always done;
869,VI,He _knew_ that you could see Five-Six--
870,VI,Ty-Six from Six-O-One.
871,VI,
872,VI,
873,VII,VII
874,VII,
875,VII,And then this tragic episode
876,VII,Of which I write occurred.
877,VII,It happened sometime in the night
878,VII,Of June the 23rd
879,VII,"That Montmorency stole away,"
880,VII,And left no sign or word.
881,VII,
882,VII,
883,VIII,VIII
884,VIII,
885,VIII,We found at dawn that he had gone
886,VIII,And left us in the lurch.
887,VIII,The Colonel sent detachments out
888,VIII,For miles around to search;
889,VIII,"A strong patrol to every knoll,"
890,VIII,"To every house, and church."
891,VIII,
892,VIII,
893,IX,IX
894,IX,
895,IX,They found no trace in any place;
896,IX,It caused a lot of talk;
897,IX,They wired down to every town
898,IX,From Plattsburg to New York.
899,IX,As it was plain he took no train
900,IX,He must have had to walk.

903,X,X
904,X,
905,X,'Twas well into the Fall before

915,XI,"He said his name was Topper,"
916,XI,"And he lived in Table Rock,"

918,XI,Gave the Old Man quite a shock;
919,XI,They were closeted together
920,XI,Until after ten o'clock.
921,XI,
922,XI,
923,XII,XII
924,XII,
925,XII,From Gettysburg to Plattsburg
926,XII,Mr. Topper came to say

928,XII,"Down near his home one day,"
929,XII,"Who, judging from his clothing, must"
930,XII,"Have walked a long, long way."
931,XII,
932,XII,
933,XIII,XIII
934,XIII,
935,XIII,He told the sad and tragic tale

938,XIII,"With a load of corn to grind,"
939,XIII,"The young man wandering on a hill,"

943,XIV,XIV
944,XIV,
945,XIV,"He took him to his farmhouse, where"
946,XIV,For seven weeks he lay
947,XIV,And talked and muttered to himself
948,XIV,In a most peculiar way.
949,XIV,He gave his name before he died
950,XIV,As Montmorency Gray.

952,XIV,
953,XV,XV
954,XV,
955,XV,"He seemed more sick than lunatic,"

959,XV,"He only cried, until he died:"

1206,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,
1207,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,When first I landed in this camp
1208,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,I used to write most every day
1209,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,"To all my friends I left behind,"
1210,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,And ask them what they had to say
1211,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,"About the old town and the girls,"
1212,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,Or what they thought about the war;
1213,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,And in return the daily mail
1214,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,It brought me letters by the score.
1215,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,
1216,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,But now my friends write me and ask
1217,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,"What keeps me from replying,"
1218,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,"And when I answer, ""It's the work,"""
1219,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,"Why, they just think I'm lying."
1220,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,So now the letters I receive
1221,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,Are few and very far between;
1222,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,They're mostly from my family
1223,HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,And never any from a queen.
