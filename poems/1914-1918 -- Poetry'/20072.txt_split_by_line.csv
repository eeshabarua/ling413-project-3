123,WITH THE COLORS,
124,THE COLORS,THE COLORS
125,THE COLORS,
126,THE COLORS,It isn't just colors and bunting--
127,THE COLORS,The red and the blue and the white.
128,THE COLORS,"It's something heaps better and finer,--"
129,THE COLORS,It's the _soul_ of my country _in sight!_
130,THE COLORS,
131,THE COLORS,"There's a lot of ceremony 'bout the Flag,"
132,THE COLORS,Though many half-baked patriots believe
133,THE COLORS,Salutin' it and hangin' it correct
134,THE COLORS,"""Is only loyalty upon the sleeve."""
135,THE COLORS,"But we who work beneath the Flag to-day,"
136,THE COLORS,"Who'll honor it--and die for it, perhaps--"
137,THE COLORS,"Get a slightly different view of the old red, white and blue"
138,THE COLORS,Than is visioned by th' criticisin' chaps.
139,THE COLORS,
140,THE COLORS,"It isn't just for decoratin' things,"
141,THE COLORS,"It isn't just an emblem, clean and bright,"
142,THE COLORS,"No matter what its ""hoist"" or what its ""fly,"""
143,THE COLORS,To us it means our country--wrong or right!
144,THE COLORS,The sobby stuff that some good people spout
145,THE COLORS,"Won't help a man to understand this view,"
146,THE COLORS,"But: Wherever that Flag goes, the man who follows, _knows_"
147,THE COLORS,"That a better, cleaner citizen _goes too!_"
148,THE COLORS,
149,THE COLORS,"It's not just a banner to look at,--"
150,THE COLORS,For which we're expected to fight;
151,THE COLORS,It's something that represents _freedom;_
152,THE COLORS,It's the _soul_ of my country--in sight!
153,THE COLORS,
154,THE COLORS,
155,LOYALTY,LOYALTY
156,LOYALTY,
157,LOYALTY,This is no time to quibble or to fool;
158,LOYALTY,"To argue over who was wrong, who right;"
159,LOYALTY,To measure fealty with a worn foot-rule;
160,LOYALTY,"To ask: ""Shall we keep still or shall we fight?"""
161,LOYALTY,The Clock of Fate has struck; the hour is here;
162,LOYALTY,War is upon us now--not far away;
163,LOYALTY,"One question only rises, clarion clear:"
164,LOYALTY,"""How may I serve my country, day by day?"""
165,LOYALTY,
166,LOYALTY,Not all of us may join the khakied throng
167,LOYALTY,Of those who answer and go forth to stem
168,LOYALTY,The tide of war. But we can all be strong
169,LOYALTY,And steady in our loyalty to them!
170,LOYALTY,"Not with unfettered thought, or tongue let loose"
171,LOYALTY,In bitterness and hate--a childish game!
172,LOYALTY,"But with a faith, untroubled by abuse,"
173,LOYALTY,That honors those who put the rest to shame!
174,LOYALTY,
175,LOYALTY,There is no middle ground on which to stand;
176,LOYALTY,We've done with useless pro-and-con debates;
177,LOYALTY,"The one-time friend, so welcome in this land,"
178,LOYALTY,Has turned upon us at our very gates.
179,LOYALTY,"There is no way, with honor, to stand back--"
180,LOYALTY,Real patriotism isn't cool--then hot;
181,LOYALTY,You cannot trim the flag to fit your lack;
182,LOYALTY,You are American--or else you're not!
183,LOYALTY,
184,LOYALTY,
185,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD
186,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,
187,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"You pull a lot of funny stuff about us, when there's peace,"
188,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"The jokes you spring are sometimes rough, and make a guy see red;"
189,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"But when there's trouble in the air you ""vaudevillians"" cease,"
190,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"And them that laughed the loudest laugh, salute the flag instead!"
191,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,
192,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"Oh, it's kid the boys along"
193,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,When there's nothing going wrong;
194,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"But when your country's facin' war,"
195,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,You sing a different song!
196,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,
197,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,The khaki that they doll us in ain't seen war service--no!
198,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,The most of it has been worn thin a-loafin' 'round the mess;
199,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"Folks think it's great to josh us when things are goin' slow,"
200,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"But when the country's all het up--we ain't so worse, I guess!"
201,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,
202,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"Then it's, ""Look! The Guard is here;"
203,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"Fine set of men, muh dear.""..."
204,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,(We'd like it better if you spread
205,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,Your jollies through th' year!)
206,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,
207,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,We're only folks--th' reg'lar kind--that answered to th' call;
208,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,We may be dumb and also blind--but still we'll see it through!
209,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,Just wearin' khaki doesn't change our insides--not a'tall!
210,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,We're human (Does that seem so strange?) waitin' to fight--for you!
211,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,
212,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,We mayn't be worth a cuss
213,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"In this ugly foreign muss,"
214,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,"But when the nation needs some help,"
215,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,Why--pass the job to us!
216,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,
217,THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD,
218,THE ALIEN,THE ALIEN
219,THE ALIEN,
220,THE ALIEN,"(Of course, this didn't happen,"
221,THE ALIEN,But if it had--
222,THE ALIEN,Would you have been shocked?)
223,THE ALIEN,
224,THE ALIEN,"She was a pretty little thing,"
225,THE ALIEN,"Round-headed, bronze-haired and trim"
226,THE ALIEN,As a yacht.
227,THE ALIEN,"And when she married a handsome, polished Prussian"
228,THE ALIEN,(Before the war was ours)
229,THE ALIEN,Her friends all said
230,THE ALIEN,She'd made no mistake.
231,THE ALIEN,"He had much money, and he wasn't arrogant--"
232,THE ALIEN,To her.
233,THE ALIEN,Their baby came--
234,THE ALIEN,"Big and blue-eyed,"
235,THE ALIEN,"Solemn and serious,"
236,THE ALIEN,With his father's arrogance in the small.
237,THE ALIEN,She knew how wonderful a child he was
238,THE ALIEN,And said so.
239,THE ALIEN,"The husband knew it, too--"
240,THE ALIEN,"Because the child looked like him,"
241,THE ALIEN,And they were happy
242,THE ALIEN,"Until the Nation roused itself,"
243,THE ALIEN,Stretched and yawned
244,THE ALIEN,And got into the hellish game of kill.
245,THE ALIEN,"Then the man,"
246,THE ALIEN,"Who had been almost human,"
247,THE ALIEN,"Dropped his mask,"
248,THE ALIEN,And uncovered his ragged soul.
249,THE ALIEN,
250,THE ALIEN,Having no sense of right or wrong--
251,THE ALIEN,No spiritual standards for measurements;
252,THE ALIEN,Feeding upon that same egotism
253,THE ALIEN,That swept his country
254,THE ALIEN,Into the depths of hate--
255,THE ALIEN,He sneered and laughed
256,THE ALIEN,At her pale patriotism
257,THE ALIEN,And the country that inspired it.
258,THE ALIEN,"There was no open break between them,"
259,THE ALIEN,For a child's small hands
260,THE ALIEN,Clung to both and kept them close.
261,THE ALIEN,Shutting her eyes to all else
262,THE ALIEN,"Save that she was his wife,"
263,THE ALIEN,She played her part well.
264,THE ALIEN,"His work--his bluff at work, instead--"
265,THE ALIEN,Was something big and important
266,THE ALIEN,(Always he looked the importance)
267,THE ALIEN,That had to do with ships--
268,THE ALIEN,Ships that idled at their docks to-day
269,THE ALIEN,Because they were interned.
270,THE ALIEN,And there was always money--
271,THE ALIEN,"More money than she had ever known,--"
272,THE ALIEN,Which he lavished--on himself
273,THE ALIEN,And his desires.
274,THE ALIEN,
275,THE ALIEN,"Not that he gave her nothing,"
276,THE ALIEN,For he did....
277,THE ALIEN,"They lived in a big hotel,"
278,THE ALIEN,And the child had everything it should have
279,THE ALIEN,And much it should not.
280,THE ALIEN,"She, too, was cared for well,"
281,THE ALIEN,After his wants were satisfied.
282,THE ALIEN,
283,THE ALIEN,Then--
284,THE ALIEN,The silent blow fell.
285,THE ALIEN,"Secret service men called upon him,"
286,THE ALIEN,And next day he was taken away
287,THE ALIEN,To a detention camp
288,THE ALIEN,For alien enemies.
289,THE ALIEN,Interned like the anchor-chafing ships
290,THE ALIEN,That once had flown his flag!
291,THE ALIEN,"The woman, up in arms, dinned at officials"
292,THE ALIEN,Until (so easy-going and so slow to learn)
293,THE ALIEN,They told her what he had done.
294,THE ALIEN,"That night she stared long at their child, asleep,"
295,THE ALIEN,"And at its father's picture,"
296,THE ALIEN,On her dresser....
297,THE ALIEN,Did the wife-courage that transcends
298,THE ALIEN,All other kinds of bravery
299,THE ALIEN,"Keep her awake for hours,"
300,THE ALIEN,"Planning, scheming, thinking?"
301,THE ALIEN,
302,THE ALIEN,*       *       *       *       *
303,THE ALIEN,
304,THE ALIEN,A week later she and the child--
305,THE ALIEN,"A blue-eyed, self-assertive mite--"
306,THE ALIEN,"Were at the camp,"
307,THE ALIEN,She carrying it (the nurse was left behind)
308,THE ALIEN,And the passports that allowed her to see him
309,THE ALIEN,"One hour, with a guard five yards away."
310,THE ALIEN,"Some of his polite impudence was gone,"
311,THE ALIEN,Yet he threw back his head and shoulders
312,THE ALIEN,And shrugged as his wife and boy came in.
313,THE ALIEN,"""Always late,"" said he, after a perfunctory kiss,"
314,THE ALIEN,"""You--and your country!"""
315,THE ALIEN,"She stared long at him, holding the child close,"
316,THE ALIEN,"Her own round, bronze head bowed."
317,THE ALIEN,
318,THE ALIEN,"Then, with a swift glance at the guard"
319,THE ALIEN,Thoughtfully chewing a straw and looking
320,THE ALIEN,"At the city of shacks,"
321,THE ALIEN,She spoke.
322,THE ALIEN,"""Did you know, Karl,"" she whispered,"
323,THE ALIEN,"""That my brother was on that transport--"
324,THE ALIEN,My only brother--a soldier--my only blood?
325,THE ALIEN,"If it had gone down--that transport--been sunk--"""
326,THE ALIEN,"""Well?"" said he. That was all."
327,THE ALIEN,"""My brother--my only--Karl!"""
328,THE ALIEN,"""Well?"" said he again. ""What of it?"""
329,THE ALIEN,"Then--her little head lifted, her eyes gone mad--"
330,THE ALIEN,"""This!"" she said. ""Rather than give"
331,THE ALIEN,Life to another human scorpion like you--
332,THE ALIEN,Man in form only!--Lower than the floor of hell itself;
333,THE ALIEN,Rather than have my blood mingle with
334,THE ALIEN,"The foul poison that is yours,"
335,THE ALIEN,To make a child of ours--
336,THE ALIEN,This: I give him back to you--
337,THE ALIEN,"And recall my love--all of my love!"""
338,THE ALIEN,"Again he shrugged his shoulders,"
339,THE ALIEN,"Yawned--and saw, too late."
340,THE ALIEN,
341,THE ALIEN,Swift as the eagle that drives a lamb to death
342,THE ALIEN,"She whipped a hat-pin from her dainty hat,"
343,THE ALIEN,Drove it with steady aim
344,THE ALIEN,Into the baby's heart
345,THE ALIEN,And handed back to the gulping man
346,THE ALIEN,All that was left of what had once meant joy--
347,THE ALIEN,A dead baby with red bubbles on its lips!
348,THE ALIEN,
349,THE ALIEN,
350,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,THE 'SKEETER FLEET
351,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,
352,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,Mighty little doin'--yet a lot to do--
353,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,"While the navy's standin' guard, we are lookin' out;"
354,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,"Patrol boats in shoals, good old craft and new"
355,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,Hustle here and skitter there--what's it all about?
356,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,
357,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,Speed boats and slow boats
358,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,"Loaf around or run,"
359,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,But ev'ry unit of this fleet
360,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,Mounts a wicked gun!
361,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,
362,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,"Pleasure craft a-plenty, all dolled up in gray"
363,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,"Grim and ugly war-paint dress, we're a gloomy lot,"
364,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,"Slidin' in and out, never in the way."
365,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,"Gosh! It's wearin' on the nerves, waitin' round--for what?"
366,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,
367,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,"Some boats are bum boats,"
368,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,Layin' for the Hun--
369,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,But ev'ry boat that flies our Flag
370,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,Mounts a wicked gun!
371,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,
372,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,Stickin' for the Big Show! Will it ever start?
373,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,"When it does, Good night, Irene! We won't make a squeak."
374,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,"""Boy Scouts of the Sea,"" watch us do our part"
375,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,If a raider or a sub. gives us just a peek!
376,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,
377,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,Tin boats and wood boats--
378,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,Ev'ry single one
379,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,Longs to get in action with
380,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,Its wicked little gun!
381,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,
382,THE 'SKEETER FLEET,
383,LITTLE MOTHER,LITTLE MOTHER
384,LITTLE MOTHER,
385,LITTLE MOTHER,"_Little mother, little mother, with the shadows in your eyes"
386,LITTLE MOTHER,"And the icy hand of Fear about your heart,"
387,LITTLE MOTHER,You cannot help your boy prepare to make his sacrifice
388,LITTLE MOTHER,"Unless you make yours bravely, at the start!_"
389,LITTLE MOTHER,
390,LITTLE MOTHER,"He is training, as a million others train;"
391,LITTLE MOTHER,He is giving what the others give--their best;
392,LITTLE MOTHER,"Make him feel your faith in him, though your troubled eyes grow dim;"

793,THE FIRST FLEET,BRIGGS OF BASE No. 8
794,THE FIRST FLEET,
795,THE FIRST FLEET,It may be that you know him. A slim and likely kid;
796,THE FIRST FLEET,"Red-headed, tall, and soft of speech and glance."
797,THE FIRST FLEET,"He never took a prize at school (his talents always hid),"
798,THE FIRST FLEET,And yet he's got a medal from the Government of France!
799,THE FIRST FLEET,
800,THE FIRST FLEET,He didn't kill a lot of men;
801,THE FIRST FLEET,He never injured one;
802,THE FIRST FLEET,He didn't hold a trench alone;
803,THE FIRST FLEET,He never manned a gun;
804,THE FIRST FLEET,He drove an ambulance--that's all;
805,THE FIRST FLEET,But those above him knew
806,THE FIRST FLEET,He'd take it into hell and back
807,THE FIRST FLEET,If he was ordered to!
808,THE FIRST FLEET,
809,THE FIRST FLEET,That night (he'd been right on the job
810,THE FIRST FLEET,For twenty hours or more)
811,THE FIRST FLEET,They telephoned again for him--
812,THE FIRST FLEET,And as he cranked--he swore.
813,THE FIRST FLEET,"Half dead for sleep, he drove too far,"
814,THE FIRST FLEET,"Straight into No Man's Land,"
815,THE FIRST FLEET,And there he gathered up four men
816,THE FIRST FLEET,Who didn't understand
817,THE FIRST FLEET,Or care what happened.... Then a chap
818,THE FIRST FLEET,Sagging with gobs of mud
819,THE FIRST FLEET,He shoved into his throbbing car
820,THE FIRST FLEET,That smelled of drugs and blood.
821,THE FIRST FLEET,
822,THE FIRST FLEET,"The other roared, but Briggs, sleep-deaf,"
823,THE FIRST FLEET,Stared at the moon on high--
824,THE FIRST FLEET,'Twas like some spent star-shell glued on
825,THE FIRST FLEET,"A blue-black, tired sky--"
826,THE FIRST FLEET,And didn't try to hear or think;
827,THE FIRST FLEET,He only tried to keep
828,THE FIRST FLEET,His car from sliding off the road--
829,THE FIRST FLEET,And not to fall asleep.
830,THE FIRST FLEET,The ambulance went skidding back
831,THE FIRST FLEET,"(His chains had lost themselves),"
832,THE FIRST FLEET,While now and then a growl came from
833,THE FIRST FLEET,Its stretcher-ladened shelves.
834,THE FIRST FLEET,"Briggs never stopped, but when the groans"
835,THE FIRST FLEET,Were punctured with a curse
836,THE FIRST FLEET,"He told the weary moon, ""At least"
837,THE FIRST FLEET,"This flivver is no hearse!"""
838,THE FIRST FLEET,And slowly yawned again.... At last
839,THE FIRST FLEET,"They rounded Trouble Bend,"
840,THE FIRST FLEET,Base Eight before them--and that ride
841,THE FIRST FLEET,Was at a welcome end....
842,THE FIRST FLEET,The blood-stained orderlies came out
843,THE FIRST FLEET,"To take the wounded in,"
844,THE FIRST FLEET,Opened the doors to lift the wrecks....
845,THE FIRST FLEET,Before they could begin
846,THE FIRST FLEET,"There tumbled out the mud-caked man,"
847,THE FIRST FLEET,Whose mouth was shot away;
848,THE FIRST FLEET,A man who stared like some wild beast
849,THE FIRST FLEET,Finally brought to bay;
850,THE FIRST FLEET,"For Briggs, Base Eight, American,"
851,THE FIRST FLEET,Had brought (beside his four)
852,THE FIRST FLEET,"A German officer, half drunk"
853,THE FIRST FLEET,For need of rest! who swore
854,THE FIRST FLEET,"And cried, and then sank back again"
855,THE FIRST FLEET,And fell asleep.... That's why
856,THE FIRST FLEET,They've decorated little Briggs--
857,THE FIRST FLEET,"Red-headed, tall, and shy!"
858,THE FIRST FLEET,
859,THE FIRST FLEET,"""I didn't do a thing,"" he growls;"
860,THE FIRST FLEET,"""'Twas just a fool mistake,"
861,THE FIRST FLEET,"And he'd have captured me, of course,"
862,THE FIRST FLEET,If _he_ had been awake.
863,THE FIRST FLEET,He tried to talk (his battered mouth
864,THE FIRST FLEET,Was just a shredded scar);
865,THE FIRST FLEET,"But we were wasting time, and so"
866,THE FIRST FLEET,I pushed him in the car
867,THE FIRST FLEET,"And came on back.... Now, what is there"
868,THE FIRST FLEET,About that sort of stuff
869,THE FIRST FLEET,To make a fuss for? I am not
870,THE FIRST FLEET,"A hero.... I'm a bluff!"""
871,THE FIRST FLEET,"The surgeon smiles.... ""If he can make"
872,THE FIRST FLEET,A capture in the night
873,THE FIRST FLEET,"When doing Red Cross work, what would"
874,THE FIRST FLEET,"He do if he should _fight_?"""
875,THE FIRST FLEET,"He asks, and looks a long way off"
876,THE FIRST FLEET,To where the pounding guns
877,THE FIRST FLEET,Are making other harmless wrecks
878,THE FIRST FLEET,Of one-time hellish Huns.
879,THE FIRST FLEET,
880,THE FIRST FLEET,"I wonder if you know him? A slim and quiet kid,"
881,THE FIRST FLEET,"Red-headed, tall, and soft of speech and glance;"
882,THE FIRST FLEET,He doesn't like to have you talk about the thing he did--
883,THE FIRST FLEET,And yet he's got a medal from the Government of France.

887,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,
888,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,"At home, he drove a taxi,"
889,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,A job he'd now disdain;
890,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,He's learning (on a queer machine)
891,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,To drive an aeroplane.
892,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,It doesn't fly--it glumps along
893,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,"And bumps him, ev'ry chance;"
894,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,"His tumbling, rumbling ""Penguin"""
895,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,Out there--Somewhere in France.
896,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,
897,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,"It isn't fun to drive it,"
898,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,But he's not out for fun;
899,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,He's going to learn to drop good bombs
900,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,Upon the no-good Hun!
901,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,"And so, until he graduates,"
902,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,He makes his Penguin prance--
903,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,"His bumping, jumping Penguin"
904,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,Out there--Somewhere in France.
905,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,
906,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,"As soon as he's a pilot,"
907,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,(And earned his Golden Wings)
908,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,"He'll take the air on high, you bet"
909,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,And do some bully things!
910,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,The Prussians will be sorry
911,THE PENGUIN DRIVER,He ever learned to dance
