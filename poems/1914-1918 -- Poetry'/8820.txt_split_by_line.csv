701,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
702,INTRODUCTION,
703,INTRODUCTION,
704,INTRODUCTION,"Because man is both militant and pacific, he has expressed in"
705,INTRODUCTION,"literature, as indeed in the other forms of art, his pacific and"
706,INTRODUCTION,"militant moods. Nor are these moods, of necessity, incompatible. War may"
707,INTRODUCTION,"become the price of peace, and peace may so decay as inevitably to bring"
708,INTRODUCTION,"about war. Of the dully unresponsive pacificist and the jingo patriot,"
709,INTRODUCTION,"quick to anger, the latter no doubt is the more dangerous to the cause"
710,INTRODUCTION,"of true freedom, yet both are ""undesirable citizens."" He who believes"
711,INTRODUCTION,"that peace is illusory and spurious, unless it be based upon justice and"
712,INTRODUCTION,"liberty, will be proud to battle, if battle he must, for the sake of"
713,INTRODUCTION,those foundations.
714,INTRODUCTION,
715,INTRODUCTION,"For the most part, the poetry of war, undertaken in this spirit, has"
716,INTRODUCTION,"touched and exalted such special qualities as patriotism, courage, self-"
717,INTRODUCTION,"sacrifice, enterprise, and endurance. Where it has tended to glorify war"
718,INTRODUCTION,"in itself, it is chiefly because war has released those qualities, so to"
719,INTRODUCTION,"speak, in stirring and spectacular ways; and where it has chosen to"
720,INTRODUCTION,"round upon war and to upbraid it, it is because war has slain ardent and"
721,INTRODUCTION,lovable youths and has brought misery and despair to women and old
722,INTRODUCTION,people. But the war poet has left the mere arguments to others. For
723,INTRODUCTION,"himself, he has seen and felt. Envisaging war from various angles, now"
724,INTRODUCTION,"romantically, now realistically, now as the celebrating chronicler, now"
725,INTRODUCTION,"as the contemplative interpreter, but always in a spirit of catholic"
726,INTRODUCTION,"curiosity, he has sung, the fall of Troy, the Roman adventures, the"
727,INTRODUCTION,"mediaeval battles and crusades, the fields of Agincourt and Waterloo,"
728,INTRODUCTION,"and the more modern revolutions. Since Homer, he has spoken with martial"
729,INTRODUCTION,"eloquence through, the voices of Drayton, Spenser, Marlowe, Webster,"
730,INTRODUCTION,"Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, Scott, Burns, Campbell, Tennyson, Browning,"
731,INTRODUCTION,"the New England group, and Walt Whitman,--to mention only a few of the"
732,INTRODUCTION,"British and American names,--and he speaks sincerely and powerfully"
733,INTRODUCTION,"to-day in the writings of Kipling. Hardy, Masefield, Binyon, Newbolt,"
734,INTRODUCTION,"Watson, Rupert Brooke, and the two young soldiers--the one English, the"
735,INTRODUCTION,other American--who have lately lost their lives while on active
736,INTRODUCTION,"service: Captain Charles Hamilton Sorley, who was killed at Hulluch,"
737,INTRODUCTION,"October 18, 1915; and Alan Seeger, who fell, mortally wounded, during"
738,INTRODUCTION,"the charge on Belloy-en-Santerre, July 4, 1916."
739,INTRODUCTION,
740,INTRODUCTION,"There can be little doubt that these several minds and spirits, stirred"
741,INTRODUCTION,"by the passion and energy of war, and reacting sensitively both to its"
742,INTRODUCTION,"cruelties and to its pities, have experienced the kinship of quickened"
743,INTRODUCTION,insight and finer unselfishness in the face of wide-ranging death. They
744,INTRODUCTION,"have silently compared, perhaps, the normal materialistic conventions in"
745,INTRODUCTION,"business, politics, education, and religion, with the relief from those"
746,INTRODUCTION,conventions that nearly all soldiers and many civilians experience in
747,INTRODUCTION,"time of war; for although war has its too gross and ugly side, it has"
748,INTRODUCTION,not dared to learn that inflexibility of custom and conduct that deadens
749,INTRODUCTION,the spirit into a tame submission. This strange rebound and exaltation
750,INTRODUCTION,would seem to be due less to the physical realities of war--which must
751,INTRODUCTION,in many ways cramp and constrain the individual--than to the relative
752,INTRODUCTION,"spiritual freedom engendered by the needs of war, if they are to be"
753,INTRODUCTION,successfully met. The man of war has an altogether unusual opportunity
754,INTRODUCTION,"to realize himself, to cleanse and heal himself through the mastering of"
755,INTRODUCTION,his physical fears; through the facing of his moral doubts; through the
756,INTRODUCTION,"reëxamination of whatever thoughts he may have possessed, theretofore,"
757,INTRODUCTION,about life and death and the universe; and through the quietly unselfish
758,INTRODUCTION,devotion he owes to the welfare of his fellows and to the cause of his
759,INTRODUCTION,native land.
760,INTRODUCTION,
761,INTRODUCTION,"Into the stuff of his thought and utterance, whether he be on active"
762,INTRODUCTION,"service or not, the poet-interpreter of war weaves these intentions, and"
763,INTRODUCTION,"coöperates with his fellows in building up a little higher and better,"
764,INTRODUCTION,"from time to time, that edifice of truth for whose completion can be"
765,INTRODUCTION,"spared no human experience, no human hope."
766,INTRODUCTION,
767,INTRODUCTION,"As already suggested, English and American literatures have both"
768,INTRODUCTION,"received genuine accessions, even thus early, arising out of the present"
769,INTRODUCTION,"great conflict, and we may be sure that other equally notable"
770,INTRODUCTION,contributions will be made. The present Anthology contains a number of
771,INTRODUCTION,representative poems produced by English-speaking men and women. The
772,INTRODUCTION,"editorial policy has been humanly hospitable, rather than academically"
773,INTRODUCTION,"critical, especially in the case of some of the verses written by"
774,INTRODUCTION,"soldiers at the Front, which, however slight in certain instances their"
775,INTRODUCTION,"technical merit may be, are yet psychologically interesting as sincere"
776,INTRODUCTION,"transcripts of personal experience, and will, it is thought, for that"
777,INTRODUCTION,"very reason, peculiarly attract and interest the reader. It goes without"
778,INTRODUCTION,saying that there are several poems in this group which conspicuously
779,INTRODUCTION,"succeed also as works of art. For the rest, the attempt has been made,"
780,INTRODUCTION,"within such limitations as have been experienced, to present pretty"
781,INTRODUCTION,freely the best of what has been found available in contemporary British
782,INTRODUCTION,"and American war verse. It must speak for itself, and the reader will"
783,INTRODUCTION,find that in not a few instances it does so with sensitive sympathy and
784,INTRODUCTION,"with living power; sometimes, too, with that quietly intimate"
785,INTRODUCTION,"companionableness which we find in Gray's _Elegy_, and which John"
786,INTRODUCTION,"Masefield, while lecturing in America in 1916, so often indicated as a"
787,INTRODUCTION,prime quality in English poetry. But if this quality appears in Chaucer
788,INTRODUCTION,"and the pre-Romantics and Wordsworth, it appears also in Longfellow and"
789,INTRODUCTION,"Lowell, in Emerson and Lanier, and in William Vaughn Moody; for American"
790,INTRODUCTION,"poetry is, after all, as English poetry,--""with a difference,""--sprung"
791,INTRODUCTION,"from the same sources, and coursing along similar channels."
792,INTRODUCTION,
793,INTRODUCTION,The new fellowship of the two great Anglo-Saxon nations which a book of
794,INTRODUCTION,"this character may, to a degree, illustrate, is filled with such high"
795,INTRODUCTION,"promise for both of them, and for all civilization, that it is perhaps"
796,INTRODUCTION,"hardly too much to say, with Ambassador Walter H. Page, in his address"
797,INTRODUCTION,"at the Pilgrims' Dinner in London, April 12, 1917: ""We shall get out of"
798,INTRODUCTION,"this association an indissoluble companionship, and we shall henceforth"
799,INTRODUCTION,have indissoluble mutual duties for mankind. I doubt if there could be
800,INTRODUCTION,another international event comparable in large value and in long
801,INTRODUCTION,"consequences to this closer association."" Mr. Balfour struck the same"
802,INTRODUCTION,"note when, during his mission to the United States, he expressed himself"
803,INTRODUCTION,"in these words: ""That this great people should throw themselves whole-"
804,INTRODUCTION,"heartedly into this mighty struggle, prepared for all efforts and"
805,INTRODUCTION,sacrifices that may be required to win success for this most righteous
806,INTRODUCTION,"cause, is an event at once so happy and so momentous that only the"
807,INTRODUCTION,"historian of the future will be able, as I believe, to measure its true"
808,INTRODUCTION,"proportions."""
809,INTRODUCTION,
810,INTRODUCTION,The words of these eminent men ratify in the field of international
811,INTRODUCTION,"politics the hopeful anticipation which Tennyson expressed in his poem,"
812,INTRODUCTION,"_Hands all Round_, as it appeared in the London _Examiner_, February 7,"
813,INTRODUCTION,1852:--
814,INTRODUCTION,
815,INTRODUCTION,"""Gigantic daughter of the West,"

820,INTRODUCTION,Permit not thou the tyrant powers

822,INTRODUCTION,But let thy broadsides roar with ours.
823,INTRODUCTION,Hands all round!

826,INTRODUCTION,"And the great name of England, round and round."

842,INTRODUCTION,seek to interpret to Britons and Americans their deepening friendship.

1755,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,Which to all islands and all continents
1756,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"Says life is neither comfort, wealth, nor fame,"

1766,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,Of cannon stand in trenches where the dead
1767,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,Clog the ensanguined ice. But life to these
1768,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"Prophetic and enraptured souls is vision,"
1769,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"And the keen ecstasy of fated strife,"
1770,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"And divination of the loss as gain,"
1771,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,And reading mysteries with brightened eyes
1772,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,In fiery shock and dazzling pain before
1773,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"The orient splendour of the face of Death,"
1774,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,As a great light beside a shadowy sea;
1775,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"And in a high will's strenuous exercise,"
1776,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,Where the warmed spirit finds its fullest strength
1777,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"And is no more afraid, and in the stroke"

1779,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,And shifting meaning of man's spiritual worth
1780,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,And mystical significance in time

1792,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"Whereof you drink, who drain and toss the cup"
1793,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,Empty and ringing by the finished feast;
1794,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,Or have it shaken from your hand by sight
1795,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,Of God against the olive woods.
1796,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,
1797,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,As Joan of Arc amid the apple trees
1798,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"With sacred joy first heard the voices, then"
1799,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,Obeying plunged at Orleans in a field
1800,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"Of spears and lived her dream and died in fire,"
1801,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"Thou, France, hast heard the voices and hast lived"
1802,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"The dream and known the meaning of the dream,"
1803,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,And read its riddle: how the soul of man
1804,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,May to one greatest purpose make itself
1805,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"A lens of clearness, how it loves the cup"
1806,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"Of deepest truth, and how its bitterest gall"
1807,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,Turns sweet to soul's surrender.
1808,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,
1809,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,And you say:
1810,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"Take days for repetition, stretch your hands"
1811,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,For mocked renewal of familiar things:
1812,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"The beaten path, the chair beside the window,"
1813,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"The crowded street, the task, the accustomed sleep,"
1814,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"And waking to the task, or many springs"
1815,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"Of lifted cloud, blue water, flowering fields--"
1816,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,"The prison-house grows close no less, the feast"
1817,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,A place of memory sick for senses dulled
1818,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,Down to the dusty end where pitiful Time
1819,O GLORIOUS FRANCE,Grown weary cries Enough!

2427,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"This is the ballad of Langemarck,"
2428,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,A story of glory and might;
2429,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Of the vast Hun horde, and Canada's part"
2430,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,In the great grim fight.
2431,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2432,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"It was April fair on the Flanders Fields,"
2433,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,But the dreadest April then
2434,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"That ever the years, in their fateful flight,"
2435,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Had brought to this world of men.
2436,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2437,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"North and east, a monster wall,"
2438,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"The mighty Hun ranks lay,"
2439,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"With fort on fort, and iron-ringed trench,"
2440,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Menacing, grim and gray."
2441,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2442,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"And south and west, like a serpent of fire,"
2443,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Serried the British lines,"
2444,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"And in between, the dying and dead,"
2445,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"And the stench of blood, and the trampled mud,"
2446,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"On the fair, sweet Belgian vines."
2447,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2448,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"And far to the eastward, harnessed and taut,"
2449,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Like a scimitar, shining and keen,"
2450,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Gleaming out of that ominous gloom,"
2451,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Old France's hosts were seen.
2452,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2453,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"When out of the grim Hun lines one night,"
2454,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,There rolled a sinister smoke;--
2455,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"A strange, weird cloud, like a pale, green shroud,"
2456,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,And death lurked in its cloak.
2457,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2458,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,On a fiend-like wind it curled along
2459,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Over the brave French ranks,"
2460,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Like a monster tree its vapours spread,"
2461,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"In hideous, burning banks"
2462,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Of poisonous fumes that scorched the night
2463,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,With their sulphurous demon danks.
2464,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2465,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"And men went mad with horror, and fled"
2466,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"From that terrible, strangling death,"
2467,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,That seemed to sear both body and soul
2468,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"With its baleful, flaming breath."
2469,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2470,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Till even the little dark men of the south,"
2471,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Who feared neither God nor man,"
2472,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Those fierce, wild fighters of Afric's steppes,"
2473,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Broke their battalions and ran:--
2474,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2475,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Ran as they never had run before,"
2476,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Gasping, and fainting for breath;"
2477,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,For they knew 't was no human foe that slew;
2478,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,And that hideous smoke meant death.
2479,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2480,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Then red in the reek of that evil cloud,"
2481,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,The Hun swept over the plain;
2482,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"And the murderer's dirk did its monster work,"
2483,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,'Mid the scythe-like shrapnel rain;
2484,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2485,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Till it seemed that at last the brute Hun hordes
2486,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Had broken that wall of steel;
2487,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"And that soon, through this breach in the freeman's dyke,"
2488,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,His trampling hosts would wheel;--
2489,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2490,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"And sweep to the south in ravaging might,"
2491,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,And Europe's peoples again
2492,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Be trodden under the tyrant's heel,"
2493,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Like herds, in the Prussian pen."
2494,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2495,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"But in that line on the British right,"
2496,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"There massed a corps amain,"
2497,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Of men who hailed from a far west land
2498,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Of mountain and forest and plain;
2499,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2500,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Men new to war and its dreadest deeds,"
2501,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,But noble and staunch and true;
2502,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Men of the open, East and West,"
2503,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Brew of old Britain's brew.
2504,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2505,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"These were the men out there that night,"
2506,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,When Hell loomed close ahead;
2507,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Who saw that pitiful, hideous rout,"
2508,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,And breathed those gases dread;
2509,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,While some went under and some went mad;
2510,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,But never a man there fled.
2511,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2512,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"For the word was ""Canada,"" theirs to fight,"
2513,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,And keep on fighting still;--
2514,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Britain said, fight, and fight they would,"
2515,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Though the Devil himself in sulphurous mood
2516,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Came over that hideous hill.
2517,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2518,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Yea, stubborn, they stood, that hero band,"
2519,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Where no soul hoped to live;
2520,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"For five, 'gainst eighty thousand men,"
2521,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Were hopeless odds to give.
2522,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2523,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Yea, fought they on! 'T was Friday eve,"
2524,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,When that demon gas drove down;
2525,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,'T was Saturday eve that saw them still
2526,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Grimly holding their own;
2527,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2528,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Sunday, Monday, saw them yet,"
2529,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"A steadily lessening band,"
2530,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"With ""no surrender"" in their hearts,"
2531,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"But the dream of a far-off land,"
2532,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2533,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Where mother and sister and love would weep
2534,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,For the hushed heart lying still;--
2535,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"But never a thought but to do their part,"
2536,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,And work the Empire's will.
2537,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2538,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Ringed round, hemmed in, and back to back,"
2539,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"They fought there under the dark,"
2540,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"And won for Empire, God and Right,"
2541,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"At grim, red Langemarck."
2542,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2543,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Wonderful battles have shaken this world,"
2544,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Since the Dawn-God overthrew Dis;
2545,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Wonderful struggles of right against wrong,"
2546,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Sung in the rhymes of the world's great song,"
2547,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,But never a greater than this.
2548,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,
2549,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"Bannockburn, Inkerman, Balaclava,"
2550,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,Marathon's godlike stand;
2551,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,"But never a more heroic deed,"

2553,LANGEMARCK AT YPRES,In any war-man's land.

2639,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,And their pennants at their knee.
2640,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"They went up to their desire,"
2641,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"To the City of the Bridges,"
2642,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,With their naked brands outdrawn

2644,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"In a swelling surf of fire,"

2646,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,Till they crumpled up and died
2647,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"Like a sudden wasted tide,"
2648,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,And the thunder in their faces beat them down and flung them wide!
2649,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,
2650,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"They had paid a thousand men,"
2651,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"Yet they formed and came again,"
2652,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"For they heard the silver bugles sounding challenge to their pride,"

2654,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"For the glory of a dream,"
2655,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"And they stormed up to the cannon's mouth and withered there, and"
2656,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,died....
2657,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,The daylight lay in ashes
2658,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"On the blackened western hill,"
2659,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,And the dead were calm and still;
2660,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,But the Night was torn with gashes--
2661,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,Sudden ragged crimson gashes--
2662,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"And the siege-guns snarled and roared,"
2663,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"With their flames thrust like a sword,"
2664,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,And the tranquil moon came riding on the heaven's silver ford.
2665,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,
2666,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"What a fearful world was there,"
2667,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,Tangled in the cold moon's hair!
2668,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"Man and beast lay hurt and screaming,"
2669,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,(Men must die when Kings are dreaming!)--
2670,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,While within the harried town
2671,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,Mothers dragged their children down
2672,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"As the awful rain came screaming,"
2673,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,For the glory of a Crown!
2674,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,
2675,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,So the Morning flung her cloak
2676,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,Through the hanging pall of smoke--
2677,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"Trimmed with red, it was, and dripping with a deep and angry stain!"
2678,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,And the Day came walking then
2679,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"Through a lane of murdered men,"
2680,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,And her light fell down before her like a Cross upon the plain!
2681,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,But the forts still crowned the height
2682,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,With a bitter iron crown!
2683,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"They had lived to flame and fight,"
2684,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,They had lived to keep the Town!
2685,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,And they poured their havoc down
2686,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,All that day ... and all that night....
2687,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"While four times their number came,"
2688,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,Pawns that played a bloody game!--
2689,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"With a silver trumpeting,"
2690,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"For the glory of the King,"
2691,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,To the barriers of the thunder and the fury of the flame!
2692,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,
2693,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"So they stormed the iron Hill,"
2694,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"O'er the sleepers lying still,"
2695,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"And their trumpets sang them forward through the dull succeeding dawns,"
2696,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"But the thunder flung them wide,"
2697,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"And they crumpled up and died,--"
2698,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,They had waged the war of monarchs--and they died the death of pawns.
2699,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,
2700,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,But the forts still stood.... Their breath
2701,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"Swept the foeman like a blade,"
2702,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,Though ten thousand men were paid
2703,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"To the hungry purse of Death,"
2704,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"Though the field was wet with blood,"
2705,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,"Still the bold defences stood,"
2706,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,Stood!
2707,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,
2708,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,And the King came out with his bodyguard at the day's departing gleam--
2709,THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,And the moon rode up behind the smoke and showed the King his dream.

3331,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3332,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Now slowly sinks the day-long labouring Sun
3333,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Behind the tranquil trees and old church-tower;
3334,THE DEATH OF PEACE,And we who watch him know our day is done;
3335,THE DEATH OF PEACE,For us too comes the evening--and the hour.
3336,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3337,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"The sunbeams slanting through those ancient trees,"
3338,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"The sunlit lichens burning on the byre,"
3339,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"The lark descending, and the homing bees,"
3340,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Proclaim the sweet relief all things desire.
3341,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3342,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Golden the river brims beneath the west,"
3343,THE DEATH OF PEACE,And holy peace to all the world is given;
3344,THE DEATH OF PEACE,The songless stockdove preens her ruddied breast;
3345,THE DEATH OF PEACE,The blue smoke windeth like a prayer to heaven.

3350,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Thy fields are spun with gossameres of gold,"
3351,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"And golden garners gather thy increase,"
3352,THE DEATH OF PEACE,And plenty crowns thy loveliness untold.
3353,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3354,THE DEATH OF PEACE,By sunlight or by starlight ever thou
3355,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Art excellent in beauty manifold;
3356,THE DEATH OF PEACE,The still star victory ever gems thy brow;
3357,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Age cannot age thee, ages make thee old."
3358,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3359,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Thy beauty brightens with the evening sun
3360,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Across the long-lit meads and distant spire:
3361,THE DEATH OF PEACE,So sleep thou well--like his thy labour done;
3362,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Rest in thy glory as he rests in fire.

3369,THE DEATH OF PEACE,The burden of the beauty that must end.
3370,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3371,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"And from the fading sunset comes a cry,"
3372,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"And in the twilight voices wailing past,"
3373,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Like wild-swans calling, ""When we rest we die,"
3374,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"And woe to them that linger and are last"";"
3375,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3376,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"And as the Sun sinks, sudden in heav'n new born"
3377,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"There shines an armed Angel like a Star,"

3386,THE DEATH OF PEACE,And turn together folded for the night;
3387,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3388,THE DEATH OF PEACE,The garden urns are black against the eve;
3389,THE DEATH OF PEACE,The white moth flitters through the fragrant glooms;
3390,THE DEATH OF PEACE,How beautiful the heav'ns!--But yet we grieve
3391,THE DEATH OF PEACE,And wander restless from the lighted rooms.
3392,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3393,THE DEATH OF PEACE,For through the world to-night a murmur thrills
3394,THE DEATH OF PEACE,As at some new-born prodigy of time--
3395,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Peace dies like twilight bleeding on the hills,"
3396,THE DEATH OF PEACE,And Darkness creeps to hide the hateful crime.
3397,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3398,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3399,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Art thou no more, O Maiden Heaven-born"
3400,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"O Peace, bright Angel of the windless morn?"
3401,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Who comest down to bless our furrow'd fields,"
3402,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Or stand like Beauty smiling 'mid the corn:
3403,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3404,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Mistress of mirth and ease and summer dreams,"
3405,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Who lingerest among the woods and streams
3406,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"To help us heap the harvest 'neath the moon,"
3407,THE DEATH OF PEACE,And homeward laughing lead the lumb'ring teams:
3408,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3409,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Who teachest to our children thy wise lore;
3410,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Who keepest full the goodman's golden store;
3411,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Who crownest Life with plenty, Death with flow'rs;"
3412,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Peace, Queen of Kindness--but of earth, no more."

3416,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Not thine but ours the fault, thy care was vain;"
3417,THE DEATH OF PEACE,For this that we have done be ours the pain;
3418,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Thou gayest much, as He who gave us all,"
3419,THE DEATH OF PEACE,And as we slew Him for it thou art slain.
3420,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3421,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Heav'n left to men the moulding of their fate:
3422,THE DEATH OF PEACE,To live as wolves or pile the pillar'd State--
3423,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Like boars and bears to grunt and growl in mire,"
3424,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Or dwell aloft, effulgent gods, elate."
3425,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3426,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Thou liftedst us: we slew and with thee fell--
3427,THE DEATH OF PEACE,From golden thrones of wisdom weeping fell.
3428,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Fate rends the chaplets from our feeble brows;
3429,THE DEATH OF PEACE,The spires of Heaven fade in fogs of hell.

3433,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"She faints, she falls; her dying eyes are dim;"
3434,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Her fingers play with those bright buds she bore
3435,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"To please us, but that she can bring no more;"
3436,THE DEATH OF PEACE,And dying yet she smiles--as Christ on him
3437,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Who slew Him slain. Her eyes so beauteous
3438,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Are lit with tears shed--not for herself but us.
3439,THE DEATH OF PEACE,
3440,THE DEATH OF PEACE,The gentle Beings of the hearth and home;
3441,THE DEATH OF PEACE,The lovely Dryads of her aisled woods;
3442,THE DEATH OF PEACE,The Angels that do dwell in solitudes
3443,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Where she dwelleth; and joyous Spirits that roam
3444,THE DEATH OF PEACE,To bless her bleating flocks and fruitful lands;
3445,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Are gather'd there to weep, and kiss her dying hands."

3448,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"And we have staunched the damned wound and deep,"
3449,THE DEATH OF PEACE,The cavern-carven wound. She doth but sleep
3450,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"And will awake. Bring wine, and new-wound wreaths"
3451,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"Wherewith to crown awaking her dear head,"
3452,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"And make her Queen again.""--But no, for Peace was dead."

3457,THE DEATH OF PEACE,With lavish tongues; and Trolls; and treacherous Things
3458,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Like loose-lipp'd Councillors and cruel Kings
3459,THE DEATH OF PEACE,Who sharpen lies and daggers subterrene:
3460,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"And flashed their evil eyes and weeping cried,"
3461,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"""We ruled the world for Peace. By her own hand she died."""

3466,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"And poison'd it with bane of lies and drew,"
3467,THE DEATH OF PEACE,And stabb'd--O God! the Cruel Cripple slew;
3468,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"And cowards fled or lent him trembling aid,"
3469,THE DEATH OF PEACE,She fell and died--in all the tale of time
3470,THE DEATH OF PEACE,"The direst deed e'er done, the most accursed crime."

3623,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,[Concerning the experiences of a journey on foot through the night of
3624,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"August 4, 1914 (the night after the formal declaration of war between"
3625,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"England and Germany), from a town near Amiens, in France, to Dieppe,"
3626,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,a distance of somewhat more than forty miles.]
3627,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,
3628,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Before I knew, the Dawn was on the road,"
3629,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Close at my side, so silently he came"
3630,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Nor gave a sign of salutation, save"
3631,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,To touch with light my sleeve and make the way
3632,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Appear as if a shining countenance
3633,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Had looked on it. Strange was this radiant Youth,"
3634,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"As I, to these fair, fertile parts of France,"
3635,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Where Caesar with his legions once had passed,"
3636,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,And where the Kaiser's Uhlans yet would pass
3637,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Or e'er another moon should cope with clouds
3638,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,For mastery of these same fields.--To-night
3639,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,(And but a month has gone since I walked there)
3640,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Well might the Kaiser write, as Caesar wrote,"
3641,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"In his new Commentaries on a Gallic war,"
3642,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"""_Fortissimi Belgae_.""--A moon ago!"
3643,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Who would have then divined that dead would lie
3644,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Like swaths of grain beneath the harvest moon
3645,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Upon these lands the ancient Belgae held,"
3646,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,From Normandy beyond renowned Liège!--
3647,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,
3648,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,But it was out of that dread August night
3649,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"From which all Europe woke to war, that we,"
3650,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"This beautiful Dawn-Youth, and I, had come,"
3651,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,He from afar. Beyond grim Petrograd
3652,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"He'd waked the moujik from his peaceful dreams,"
3653,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Bid the muezzin call to morning prayer
3654,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Where minarets rise o'er the Golden Horn,"
3655,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,And driven shadows from the Prussian march
3656,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,To lie beneath the lindens of the _stadt_.
3657,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Softly he'd stirred the bells to ring at Rheims,"
3658,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"He'd knocked at high Montmartre, hardly asleep;"
3659,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Heard the sweet carillon of doomed Louvain,"
3660,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Boylike, had tarried for a moment's play"
3661,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Amid the traceries of Amiens,"
3662,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"And then was hast'ning on the road to Dieppe,"
3663,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,When he o'ertook me drowsy from the hours
3664,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Through which I'd walked, with no companions else"
3665,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Than ghostly kilometer posts that stood
3666,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,As sentinels' of space along the way.--
3667,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Often, in doubt, I'd paused to question one,"
3668,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"With nervous hands, as they who read Moon-type;"
3669,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,And more than once I'd caught a moment's sleep
3670,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Beside the highway, in the dripping grass,"
3671,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"While one of these white sentinels stood guard,"
3672,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Knowing me for a friend, who loves the road,"
3673,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"And best of all by night, when wheels do sleep"
3674,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,And stars alone do walk abroad.--But once
3675,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Three watchful shadows, deeper than the dark,"
3676,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Laid hands on me and searched me for the marks
3677,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Of traitor or of spy, only to find"
3678,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Over my heart the badge of loyalty.--
3679,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,With wish for _bon voyage_ they gave me o'er
3680,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,To the white guards who led me on again.
3681,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,
3682,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Thus Dawn o'ertook me and with magic speech
3683,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Made me forget the night as we strode on.
3684,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Where'er he looked a miracle was wrought:
3685,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,A tree grew from the darkness at a glance;
3686,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,A hut was thatched; a new chateau was reared
3687,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Of stone, as weathered as the church at Caen;"
3688,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Gray blooms were coloured suddenly in red;
3689,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,A flag was flung across the eastern sky.--
3690,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Nearer at hand, he made me then aware"
3691,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Of peasant women bending in the fields,"
3692,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Cradling and gleaning by the first scant light,"
3693,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Their sons and husbands somewhere o'er the edge
3694,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Of these green-golden fields which they had sowed,"
3695,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"But will not reap,--out somewhere on the march,"
3696,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,God but knows where and if they come again.
3697,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,One fallow field he pointed out to me
3698,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Where but the day before a peasant ploughed,"
3699,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Dreaming of next year's fruit, and there his plough"
3700,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Stood now mid-field, his horses commandeered,"
3701,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,A monstrous sable crow perched on the beam.
3702,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,
3703,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Before I knew, the Dawn was on the road,"
3704,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Far from my side, so silently he went,"
3705,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Catching his golden helmet as he ran,"
3706,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"And hast'ning on along the dun straight way,"
3707,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Where old men's sabots now began to clack
3708,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"And withered women, knitting, led their cows,"
3709,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"On, on to call the men of Kitchener"
3710,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Down to their coasts,--I shouting after him:"
3711,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"""O Dawn, would you had let the world sleep on"
3712,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Till all its armament were turned to rust,"
3713,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Nor waked it to this day of hideous hate,"
3714,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Of man's red murder and of woman's woe!"""
3715,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,
3716,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Famished and lame, I came at last to Dieppe,"
3717,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"But Dawn had made his way across the sea,"
3718,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"And, as I climbed with heavy feet the cliff,"
3719,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Was even then upon the sky-built towers
3720,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Of that great capital where nations all,"
3721,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,"Teuton, Italian, Gallic, English, Slav,"
3722,THE ROAD TO DIEPPE,Forget long hates in one consummate faith.

4037,I,"I did not know until a woman told me,"
4038,I,Sobbing over the muslin she sold me.
4039,I,Then I went out and walked to the square
4040,I,And saw a few dazed people standing there.
4041,I,
4042,I,"And then the drums beat, the drums beat!"
4043,I,O then the drums beat!
4044,I,"And hurrying, stumbling through the street"

4046,I,O I have heard the drums beat
4047,I,For war!
4048,I,"I have heard the townsfolk come,"
4049,I,I have heard the roll and thunder of the nearest drum

4058,I,"And then the drum beat,"
4059,I,"The fatal drum, beat,"
4060,I,And the drummer marched through the street

4062,I,And the drummer above took up the beat
4063,I,And sent it onward where
4064,I,"Huddled, we stood and heard the drums roll,"
4065,I,And then a bell began to toll.

4094,II,The younger women do not weep. They dream and stare.

4107,II,
4108,II,"Except for something, something in the air,"
4109,II,Except for the weeping of the wild old women of Finistère.
4110,II,How long will the others dream and stare?

4465,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,"Ah, then you must guess how my fingers are itching to talk to a pen;"
4466,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,"For I was at Soissons, and saw it, the death of the twelve Englishmen."
4467,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,
4468,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,"My leg, _malheureusement_, I left it behind on the banks of the Aisne."
4469,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,Regret? I would pay with the other to witness their valor again.
4470,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,"A trifle, indeed, I assure you, to give for the honor to tell"

4472,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,
4473,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,Let me draw you a plan of the battle. Here we French and your Engineers
4474,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,stood;
4475,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,Over there a detachment of German sharpshooters lay hid in a wood.
4476,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,A _mitrailleuse_ battery planted on top of this well-chosen ridge
4477,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,Held the road for the Prussians and covered the direct approach to the
4478,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,bridge.
4479,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,
4480,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,It was madness to dare the dense murder that spewed from those ghastly
4481,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,machines.
4482,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,(Only those who have danced to its music can know what the
4483,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,_mitrailleuse_ means.)
4484,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,But the bridge on the Aisne was a menace; our safety demanded its fall:
4485,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,"""Engineers,--volunteers!"" In a body, the Royals stood out at the call."
4486,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,
4487,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,Death at best was the fate of that mission--to their glory not one was
4488,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,dismayed.
4489,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,A party was chosen--and seven survived till the powder was laid.
4490,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,And _they_ died with their fuses unlighted. Another detachment! Again
4491,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,A sortie is made--all too vainly. The bridge still commanded the Aisne.
4492,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,
4493,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,We were fighting two foes--Time and Prussia--the moments were worth more
4494,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,than troops.
4495,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,We _must_ blow up the bridge. A lone soldier darts out from the Royals
4496,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,and swoops
4497,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,For the fuse! Fate seems with us. We cheer him; he answers--our hopes
4498,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,are reborn!
4499,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,A ball rips his visor--his khaki shows red where another has torn.
4500,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,
4501,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,Will he live--will he last--will he make it? _Hélas!_ And so near to the

4506,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,"Yes, he _does_! See, the match flares! A rifle rings out from the wood"

4512,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,"eighth, and ninth fail!"
4513,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,A tenth! _Sacré nom!_ But these English are soldiers--they know how to

4517,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,
4518,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,Ten we count--ten who ventured unquailing--ten there were--and ten are
4519,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,no more!
4520,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,Yet another salutes and superbly essays where the ten failed before.
4521,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,"God of Battles, look down and protect him! Lord, his heart is as Thine--"

4528,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,"And I thought of my beautiful Paris, and gave a last look at the land,"
4529,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,"At France, my _belle France_, in her glory of blue sky and green field"
4530,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,and wood.
4531,THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS,"Death with honor, but never surrender. And to die with such men--it was"

5158,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,And yet beside one stricken house there is a glimpse of grass--
5159,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,Look for it when you pass.
5160,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,
5161,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,Beyond the church whose pitted spire
5162,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,Seems balanced on a strand

5182,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,At length we rose up from this ease
5183,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,"Of tranquil happy mind,"

5185,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,Some new pleasaunce to find;
5186,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,"And there some yellow daffodils, and jasmine hanging high,"
5187,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,Did rest the tired eye.

5189,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,The fairest and most fragrant
5190,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,Of the many sweets we found
5191,HOME THOUGHTS FROM LAVENTIE,Was a little bush of Daphne flower

6372,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,
6373,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,
6374,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,Courage came to you with your boyhood's grace
6375,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,Of ardent life and limb.
6376,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"Each day new dangers steeled you to the test,"
6377,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"To ride, to climb, to swim."
6378,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,Your hot blood taught you carelessness of death
6379,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,With every breath.
6380,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,
6381,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,So when you went to play another game
6382,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,You could not but be brave:
6383,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"An Empire's team, a rougher football field,"
6384,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,The end--perhaps your grave.
6385,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,What matter? On the winning of a goal
6386,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,You staked your soul.
6387,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,
6388,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"Yes, you wore courage as you wore your youth"
6389,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,With carelessness and joy.
6390,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,But in what Spartan school of discipline
6391,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"Did you get patience, boy?"
6392,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,How did you learn to bear this long-drawn pain
6393,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,And not complain?
6394,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,
6395,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"Restless with throbbing hopes, with thwarted aims,"
6396,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"Impulsive as a colt,"
6397,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,How do you lie here month by weary month
6398,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"Helpless, and not revolt?"
6399,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,What joy can these monotonous days afford
6400,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,Here in a ward?
6401,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,
6402,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"Yet you are merry as the birds in spring,"
6403,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"Or feign the gaiety,"
6404,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,Lest those who dress and tend your wound each day
6405,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,Should guess the agony.
6406,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,Lest they should suffer--this the only fear
6407,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,You let draw near.
6408,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,
6409,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,Greybeard philosophy has sought in books
6410,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"And argument this truth,"
6411,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"That man is greater than his pain, but you"
6412,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,Have learnt it in your youth.
6413,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,You know the wisdom taught by Calvary
6414,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,At twenty-three.
6415,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,
6416,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"Death would have found you brave, but braver still"

6420,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"You bear your knowledge lightly, graduate"
6421,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,Of unkind Fate.
6422,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,
6423,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"Careless philosopher, the first to laugh,"
6424,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,The latest to complain.
6425,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,"Unmindful that you teach, you taught me this"
6426,TO A SOLDIER IN HOSPITAL,In your long fight with pain:

6437,BETWEEN THE LINES,
6438,BETWEEN THE LINES,"When consciousness came back, he found he lay"
6439,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Between the opposing fires, but could not tell"
6440,BETWEEN THE LINES,On which hand were his friends; and either way
6441,BETWEEN THE LINES,For him to turn was chancy--bullet and shell
6442,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Whistling and shrieking over him, as the glare"
6443,BETWEEN THE LINES,Of searchlights scoured the darkness to blind day.
6444,BETWEEN THE LINES,"He scrambled to his hands and knees ascare,"
6445,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Dragging his wounded foot through puddled clay,"
6446,BETWEEN THE LINES,And tumbled in a hole a shell had scooped
6447,BETWEEN THE LINES,At random in a turnip-field between
6448,BETWEEN THE LINES,The unseen trenches where the foes lay cooped
6449,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Through that unending-battle of unseen,"
6450,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Dead-locked, league-stretching armies; and quite spent"
6451,BETWEEN THE LINES,"He rolled upon his back within the pit,"
6452,BETWEEN THE LINES,"And lay secure, thinking of all it meant--"
6453,BETWEEN THE LINES,"His lying in that little hole, sore hit,"
6454,BETWEEN THE LINES,"But living, while across the starry sky"
6455,BETWEEN THE LINES,Shrapnel and shell went screeching overhead--
6456,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Of all it meant that he, Tom Dodd, should lie"
6457,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Among the Belgian turnips, while his bed...."
6458,BETWEEN THE LINES,"If it were he, indeed, who'd climbed each night,"
6459,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Fagged with the day's work, up the narrow stair,"
6460,BETWEEN THE LINES,"And slipt his clothes off in the candle-light,"
6461,BETWEEN THE LINES,Too tired to fold them neatly in a chair
6462,BETWEEN THE LINES,The way his mother'd taught him--too dog-tired
6463,BETWEEN THE LINES,"After the long day's serving in the shop,"
6464,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Inquiring what each customer required,"
6465,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Politely talking weather, fit to drop...."
6466,BETWEEN THE LINES,
6467,BETWEEN THE LINES,"And now for fourteen days and nights, at least,"
6468,BETWEEN THE LINES,"He hadn't had his clothes off, and had lain"
6469,BETWEEN THE LINES,"In muddy trenches, napping like a beast"
6470,BETWEEN THE LINES,"With one eye open, under sun and rain"
6471,BETWEEN THE LINES,And that unceasing hell-fire....
6472,BETWEEN THE LINES,It was strange
6473,BETWEEN THE LINES,How things turned out--the chances! You'd just got
6474,BETWEEN THE LINES,"To take your luck in life, you couldn't change"
6475,BETWEEN THE LINES,Your luck.
6476,BETWEEN THE LINES,And so here he was lying shot
6477,BETWEEN THE LINES,Who just six months ago had thought to spend
6478,BETWEEN THE LINES,"His days behind a counter. Still, perhaps...."
6479,BETWEEN THE LINES,"And now, God only knew how he would end!"
6480,BETWEEN THE LINES,
6481,BETWEEN THE LINES,He'd like to know how many of the chaps
6482,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Had won back to the trench alive, when he"
6483,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Had fallen wounded and been left for dead,"
6484,BETWEEN THE LINES,If any!...
6485,BETWEEN THE LINES,"This was different, certainly,"
6486,BETWEEN THE LINES,From selling knots of tape and reels of thread
6487,BETWEEN THE LINES,And knots of tape and reels of thread and knots
6488,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Of tape and reels of thread and knots of tape,"
6489,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Day in, day out, and answering ""Have you got""'s"
6490,BETWEEN THE LINES,"And ""Do you keep""'s till there seemed no escape"
6491,BETWEEN THE LINES,"From everlasting serving in a shop,"
6492,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Inquiring what each customer required,"
6493,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Politely talking weather, fit to drop,"
6494,BETWEEN THE LINES,"With swollen ankles, tired...."
6495,BETWEEN THE LINES,But he was tired
6496,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Now. Every bone was aching, and had ached"
6497,BETWEEN THE LINES,For fourteen days and nights in that wet trench--
6498,BETWEEN THE LINES,Just duller when he slept than when he waked--
6499,BETWEEN THE LINES,Crouching for shelter from the steady drench
6500,BETWEEN THE LINES,Of shell and shrapnel....
6501,BETWEEN THE LINES,"That old trench, it seemed"
6502,BETWEEN THE LINES,Almost like home to him. He'd slept and fed
6503,BETWEEN THE LINES,"And sung and smoked in it, while shrapnel screamed"
6504,BETWEEN THE LINES,And shells went whining harmless overhead--
6505,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Harmless, at least, as far as he...."
6506,BETWEEN THE LINES,But Dick--
6507,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Dick hadn't found them harmless yesterday,"
6508,BETWEEN THE LINES,"At breakfast, when he'd said he couldn't stick"
6509,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Eating dry bread, and crawled out the back way,"
6510,BETWEEN THE LINES,And brought them butter in a lordly dish--
6511,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Butter enough for all, and held it high,"
6512,BETWEEN THE LINES,Yellow and fresh and clean as you would wish--
6513,BETWEEN THE LINES,When plump upon the plate from out the sky
6514,BETWEEN THE LINES,"A shell fell bursting.... Where the butter went,"
6515,BETWEEN THE LINES,God only knew!...
6516,BETWEEN THE LINES,And Dick.... He dared not think
6517,BETWEEN THE LINES,Of what had come to Dick.... or what it meant--
6518,BETWEEN THE LINES,The shrieking and the whistling and the stink
6519,BETWEEN THE LINES,He'd lived in fourteen days and nights. 'T was luck
6520,BETWEEN THE LINES,That he still lived.... And queer how little then
6521,BETWEEN THE LINES,He seemed to care that Dick.... perhaps 't was pluck
6522,BETWEEN THE LINES,That hardened him--a man among the men--
6523,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Perhaps.... Yet, only think things out a bit,"
6524,BETWEEN THE LINES,"And he was rabbit-livered, blue with funk!"
6525,BETWEEN THE LINES,And he'd liked Dick ... and yet when Dick was hit
6526,BETWEEN THE LINES,He hadn't turned a hair. The meanest skunk
6527,BETWEEN THE LINES,He should have thought would feel it when his mate
6528,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Was blown to smithereens--Dick, proud as punch,"
6529,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Grinning like sin, and holding up the plate--"
6530,BETWEEN THE LINES,"But he had gone on munching his dry hunch,"
6531,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Unwinking, till he swallowed the last crumb."
6532,BETWEEN THE LINES,Perhaps 't was just because he dared not let
6533,BETWEEN THE LINES,"His mind run upon Dick, who'd been his chum."
6534,BETWEEN THE LINES,"He dared not now, though he could not forget."
6535,BETWEEN THE LINES,
6536,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Dick took his luck. And, life or death, 't was luck"
6537,BETWEEN THE LINES,From first to last; and you'd just got to trust
6538,BETWEEN THE LINES,Your luck and grin. It wasn't so much pluck
6539,BETWEEN THE LINES,"As knowing that you'd got to, when needs must,"
6540,BETWEEN THE LINES,And better to die grinning....
6541,BETWEEN THE LINES,Quiet now
6542,BETWEEN THE LINES,Had fallen on the night. On either hand
6543,BETWEEN THE LINES,The guns were quiet. Cool upon his brow
6544,BETWEEN THE LINES,"The quiet darkness brooded, as he scanned"
6545,BETWEEN THE LINES,The starry sky. He'd never seen before
6546,BETWEEN THE LINES,"So many stars. Although, of course, he'd known"
6547,BETWEEN THE LINES,"That there were stars, somehow before the war"
6548,BETWEEN THE LINES,"He'd never realised them--so thick-sown,"
6549,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Millions and millions. Serving in the shop,"
6550,BETWEEN THE LINES,Stars didn't count for much; and then at nights
6551,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Strolling the pavements, dull and fit to drop,"
6552,BETWEEN THE LINES,You didn't see much but the city lights.
6553,BETWEEN THE LINES,He'd never in his life seen so much sky
6554,BETWEEN THE LINES,As he'd seen this last fortnight. It was queer
6555,BETWEEN THE LINES,The things war taught you. He'd a mind to try
6556,BETWEEN THE LINES,To count the stars--they shone so bright and clear.
6557,BETWEEN THE LINES,
6558,BETWEEN THE LINES,"One, two, three, four.... Ah, God, but he was tired...."
6559,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Five, six, seven, eight...."
6560,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Yes, it was number eight."
6561,BETWEEN THE LINES,And what was the next thing that she required?
6562,BETWEEN THE LINES,"(Too bad of customers to come so late,"
6563,BETWEEN THE LINES,At closing time!) Again within the shop
6564,BETWEEN THE LINES,"He handled knots of tape and reels of thread,"
6565,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Politely talking weather, fit to drop...."
6566,BETWEEN THE LINES,
6567,BETWEEN THE LINES,When once again the whole sky overhead
6568,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Flared blind with searchlights, and the shriek of shell"
6569,BETWEEN THE LINES,And scream of shrapnel roused him. Drowsily
6570,BETWEEN THE LINES,"He stared about him, wondering. Then he fell"
6571,BETWEEN THE LINES,Into deep dreamless slumber.
6572,BETWEEN THE LINES,
6573,BETWEEN THE LINES,*       *       *       *       *
6574,BETWEEN THE LINES,
6575,BETWEEN THE LINES,He could see
6576,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Two dark eyes peeping at him, ere he knew"
6577,BETWEEN THE LINES,"He was awake, and it again was day--"
6578,BETWEEN THE LINES,"An August morning, burning to clear blue."
6579,BETWEEN THE LINES,The frightened rabbit scuttled....
6580,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Far away,"
6581,BETWEEN THE LINES,"A sound of firing.... Up there, in the sky"
6582,BETWEEN THE LINES,Big dragon-flies hung hovering.... Snowballs burst
6583,BETWEEN THE LINES,About them.... Flies and snowballs. With a cry
6584,BETWEEN THE LINES,He crouched to watch the airmen pass--the first
6585,BETWEEN THE LINES,"That he'd seen under fire. Lord, that was pluck--"
6586,BETWEEN THE LINES,Shells bursting all about them--and what nerve!
6587,BETWEEN THE LINES,"They took their chance, and trusted to their luck."
6588,BETWEEN THE LINES,"At such a dizzy height to dip and swerve,"
6589,BETWEEN THE LINES,Dodging the shell-fire....
6590,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Hell! but one was hit,"
6591,BETWEEN THE LINES,"And tumbling like a pigeon, plump...."
6592,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Thank Heaven,"
6593,BETWEEN THE LINES,"It righted, and then turned; and after it"
6594,BETWEEN THE LINES,"The whole flock followed safe--four, five, six, seven,"
6595,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Yes, they were all there safe. He hoped they'd win"
6596,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Back to their lines in safety. They deserved,"
6597,BETWEEN THE LINES,Even if they were Germans.... 'T was no sin
6598,BETWEEN THE LINES,To wish them luck. Think how that beggar swerved
6599,BETWEEN THE LINES,Just in the nick of time!
6600,BETWEEN THE LINES,"He, too, must try"
6601,BETWEEN THE LINES,"To win back to the lines, though, likely as not,"
6602,BETWEEN THE LINES,He'd take the wrong turn: but he couldn't lie
6603,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Forever in that hungry hole and rot,"
6604,BETWEEN THE LINES,"He'd got to take his luck, to take his chance"
6605,BETWEEN THE LINES,Of being sniped by foes or friends. He'd be
6606,BETWEEN THE LINES,With any luck in Germany or France
6607,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Or Kingdom-come, next morning...."
6608,BETWEEN THE LINES,Drearily
6609,BETWEEN THE LINES,"The blazing day burnt over him, shot and shell"
6610,BETWEEN THE LINES,Whistling and whining ceaselessly. But light
6611,BETWEEN THE LINES,"Faded at last, and as the darkness fell"
6612,BETWEEN THE LINES,"He rose, and crawled away into the night."

6631,THE WHITE COMRADE,"As we ebbed with the battle-tide,"
6632,THE WHITE COMRADE,Fingers of red-hot steel
6633,THE WHITE COMRADE,Suddenly closed on my side.
6634,THE WHITE COMRADE,"I fell, and began to pray."
6635,THE WHITE COMRADE,I crawled on my hands and lay
6636,THE WHITE COMRADE,Where a shallow crater yawned wide;
6637,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Then,--I swooned...."
6638,THE WHITE COMRADE,
6639,THE WHITE COMRADE,"When I woke, it was yet day."
6640,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Fierce was the pain of my wound,"
6641,THE WHITE COMRADE,"But I saw it was death to stir,"
6642,THE WHITE COMRADE,For fifty paces away
6643,THE WHITE COMRADE,Their trenches were.
6644,THE WHITE COMRADE,In torture I prayed for the dark
6645,THE WHITE COMRADE,And the stealthy step of my friend
6646,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Who, staunch to the very end,"
6647,THE WHITE COMRADE,Would creep to the danger zone
6648,THE WHITE COMRADE,And offer his life as a mark
6649,THE WHITE COMRADE,To save my own.
6650,THE WHITE COMRADE,
6651,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Night fell. I heard his tread,"
6652,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Not stealthy, but firm and serene,"
6653,THE WHITE COMRADE,As if my comrade's head
6654,THE WHITE COMRADE,Were lifted far from that scene
6655,THE WHITE COMRADE,Of passion and pain and dread;
6656,THE WHITE COMRADE,As if my comrade's heart
6657,THE WHITE COMRADE,In carnage took no part;
6658,THE WHITE COMRADE,As if my comrade's feet
6659,THE WHITE COMRADE,Were set on some radiant street
6660,THE WHITE COMRADE,Such as no darkness might haunt;
6661,THE WHITE COMRADE,"As if my comrade's eyes,"
6662,THE WHITE COMRADE,"No deluge of flame could surprise,"
6663,THE WHITE COMRADE,"No death and destruction daunt,"
6664,THE WHITE COMRADE,"No red-beaked bird dismay,"
6665,THE WHITE COMRADE,Nor sight of decay.
6666,THE WHITE COMRADE,
6667,THE WHITE COMRADE,Then in the bursting shells' dim light
6668,THE WHITE COMRADE,I saw he was clad in white.
6669,THE WHITE COMRADE,For a moment I thought that I saw the smock
6670,THE WHITE COMRADE,Of a shepherd in search of his flock.
6671,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Alert were the enemy, too,"
6672,THE WHITE COMRADE,And their bullets flew
6673,THE WHITE COMRADE,Straight at a mark no bullet could fail;
6674,THE WHITE COMRADE,For the seeker was tall and his robe was bright;
6675,THE WHITE COMRADE,But he did not flee nor quail.
6676,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Instead, with unhurrying stride"
6677,THE WHITE COMRADE,"He came,"
6678,THE WHITE COMRADE,"And gathering my tall frame,"
6679,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Like a child, in his arms...."
6680,THE WHITE COMRADE,
6681,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Again I swooned,"
6682,THE WHITE COMRADE,And awoke
6683,THE WHITE COMRADE,From a blissful dream
6684,THE WHITE COMRADE,In a cave by a stream.
6685,THE WHITE COMRADE,My silent comrade had bound my side.
6686,THE WHITE COMRADE,"No pain now was mine, but a wish that I spoke,--"
6687,THE WHITE COMRADE,A mastering wish to serve this man
6688,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Who had ventured through hell my doom to revoke,"
6689,THE WHITE COMRADE,As only the truest of comrades can.
6690,THE WHITE COMRADE,"I begged him to tell me how best I might aid him,"
6691,THE WHITE COMRADE,And urgently prayed him
6692,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Never to leave me, whatever betide;"
6693,THE WHITE COMRADE,When I saw he was hurt--
6694,THE WHITE COMRADE,Shot through the hands that were clasped in prayer!
6695,THE WHITE COMRADE,"Then, as the dark drops gathered there"
6696,THE WHITE COMRADE,"And fell in the dirt,"
6697,THE WHITE COMRADE,The wounds of my friend
6698,THE WHITE COMRADE,Seemed to me such as no man might bear.
6699,THE WHITE COMRADE,Those bullet-holes in the patient hands
6700,THE WHITE COMRADE,Seemed to transcend
6701,THE WHITE COMRADE,All horrors that ever these war-drenched lands
6702,THE WHITE COMRADE,Had known or would know till the mad world's end.
6703,THE WHITE COMRADE,Then suddenly I was aware
6704,THE WHITE COMRADE,"That his feet had been wounded, too;"
6705,THE WHITE COMRADE,"And, dimming the white of his side,"
6706,THE WHITE COMRADE,A dull stain grew.
6707,THE WHITE COMRADE,"""You are hurt, White Comrade!"" I cried."
6708,THE WHITE COMRADE,His words I already foreknew:
6709,THE WHITE COMRADE,"""These are old wounds,"" said he,"
6710,THE WHITE COMRADE,"""But of late they have troubled me."""

6738,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"I'm gay! You bet I _am_ gay,"
6739,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,But I wasn't a while ago.
6740,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"If you'd seen me even to-day,"
6741,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"The darnedest picture of woe,"
6742,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"With this Caliban mug of mine,"
6743,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"So ravaged and raw and red,"
6744,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Turned to the wall--in fine
6745,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Wishing that I was dead....
6746,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"What has happened since then,"
6747,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Since I lay with my face to the wall,"
6748,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,The most despairing of men!
6749,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Listen! I'll tell you all.
6750,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,
6751,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"That _poilu_ across the way,"
6752,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"With the shrapnel wound on his head,"
6753,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Has a sister: she came to-day
6754,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,To sit awhile by his bed.
6755,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,All morning I heard him fret:
6756,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"""Oh, when will she come, Fleurette?"""
6757,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,
6758,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Then sudden, a joyous cry;"
6759,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,The tripping of little feet;
6760,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"The softest, tenderest sigh;"
6761,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,A voice so fresh and sweet;
6762,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Clear as a silver bell,"
6763,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Fresh as the morning dews:
6764,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"""_C'est toi, c'est toi, Marcel!"
6765,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Mon frère, comme je suis heureuse!_"""
6766,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,
6767,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,So over the blanket's rim
6768,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"I raised my terrible face,"
6769,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,And I saw--how I envied him!
6770,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,A girl of such delicate grace;
6771,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Sixteen, all laughter and love;"
6772,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"As gay as a linnet, and yet"
6773,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,As tenderly sweet as a dove;
6774,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Half woman, half child--Fleurette."
6775,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,
6776,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Then I turned to the wall again.
6777,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"(I was awfully blue, you see,)"
6778,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,And I thought with a bitter pain:
6779,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"""Such visions are not for me."""
6780,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"So there like a log I lay,"
6781,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"All hidden, I thought, from view,"
6782,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,When sudden I heard her say:
6783,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"""Ah! Who is that _malheureux_?"""
6784,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Then briefly I heard him tell
6785,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,(However he came to know)
6786,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,How I'd smothered a bomb that fell
6787,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Into the trench, and so"
6788,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"None of my men were hit,"
6789,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Though it busted me up a bit.
6790,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,
6791,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Well, I didn't quiver an eye,"
6792,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,And he chattered and there she sat;
6793,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,And I fancied I heard her sigh--
6794,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,But I wouldn't just swear to that.
6795,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"And maybe she wasn't so bright,"
6796,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Though she talked in a merry strain,"
6797,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"And I closed my eyes ever so tight,"
6798,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Yet I saw her ever so plain:
6799,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Her dear little tilted nose,"
6800,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Her delicate, dimpled chin,"
6801,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Her mouth like a budding rose,"
6802,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,And the glistening pearls within;
6803,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Her eyes like the violet:
6804,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Such a rare little queen--Fleurette.
6805,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,
6806,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"And at last when she rose to go,"
6807,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"The light was a little dim,"
6808,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"And I ventured to peep, and so"
6809,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"I saw her, graceful and slim,"
6810,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"And she kissed him and kissed him, and oh"
6811,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,How I envied and envied him!
6812,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,
6813,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,So when she was gone I said
6814,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,In rather a dreary voice
6815,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,To him of the opposite bed:
6816,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"""Ah, friend, how you must rejoice!"
6817,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"But me, I'm a thing of dread."
6818,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"For me nevermore the bliss,"
6819,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"The thrill of a woman's kiss."""
6820,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,
6821,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Then I stopped, for lo! she was there,"
6822,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,And a great light shone in her eyes.
6823,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"And me! I could only stare,"
6824,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"I was taken so by surprise,"
6825,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,When gently she bent her head:
6826,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"""_May I kiss you, sergeant?_"" she said."
6827,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,
6828,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Then she kissed my burning lips,"
6829,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"With her mouth like a scented flower,"
6830,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"And I thrilled to the finger-tips,"
6831,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,And I hadn't even the power
6832,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"To say: ""God bless you, dear!"""
6833,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,And I felt such a precious tear
6834,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Pall on my withered cheek,"
6835,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,And darn it! I couldn't speak.
6836,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,
6837,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"And so she went sadly away,"
6838,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,And I know that my eyes were wet.
6839,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Ah, not to my dying day"
6840,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"Will I forget, forget!"
6841,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,Can you wonder now I am gay?
6842,THE WOUNDED CANADIAN SPEAKS:,"God bless her, that little Fleurette!"
