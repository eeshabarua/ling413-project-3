152,INDEX,
153,INDEX,Over Here
154,INDEX,
155,INDEX,
156,INDEX,"Pledged to the bravest and the best,"
157,INDEX,"We stand, who cannot share the fray,"
158,INDEX,Staunch for the danger and the test.
159,INDEX,For them at night we kneel and pray.
160,INDEX,"Be with them, Lord, who serve the truth,"
161,INDEX,And make us worthy of our youth!
162,INDEX,
163,INDEX,Here mother-love and father-love
164,INDEX,Unite in love of country now;
165,INDEX,"Here to the flag that flies above,"
166,INDEX,Our heads we reverently bow;
167,INDEX,"Here as one people, night and day,"
168,INDEX,For victory we work and pray.
169,INDEX,
170,INDEX,"Nor race nor creed shall difference make,"
171,INDEX,Nor bigot mar the zealot's plan;
172,INDEX,"We give our all for Freedom's sake,"
173,INDEX,"Each man a king, each king a man."
174,INDEX,"Make us the equal, Lord, we pray"
175,INDEX,Of them who die for truth to-day!
176,INDEX,
177,INDEX,"Let us as gladly give our best,"
178,INDEX,Let us as bravely pay the price
179,INDEX,"As they, who in the bitter test"
180,INDEX,Meet the supremest sacrifice.
181,INDEX,"Oh, God! Wherever we are led,"
182,INDEX,Let us be worthy of our dead!
183,INDEX,
184,INDEX,"Let us not compromise the truth,"
185,INDEX,Let us not cringe so much in fear
186,INDEX,That foes may whisper to our youth
187,INDEX,That we have failed in courage here.
188,INDEX,"Lord, strengthen us, that they may know"
189,INDEX,Our spirits follow where they go!
190,INDEX,
191,INDEX,
192,INDEX,
193,INDEX,Why We Fight
194,INDEX,
195,INDEX,
196,INDEX,This is the thing we fight:
197,INDEX,A cry of terror in the night;
198,INDEX,A ship on work of mercy bent--
199,INDEX,A carrier of the sick and maimed--
200,INDEX,"Beneath the cruel waters sent,"
201,INDEX,"And those that did it, unashamed."
202,INDEX,
203,INDEX,A woman who had tried to fill
204,INDEX,A mother's place; had nursed the ill
205,INDEX,And soothed the troubled brows of pain
206,INDEX,"And earned the dying's grateful prayers,"
207,INDEX,Before a wall by soldiers slain!
208,INDEX,And such a poor pretext was theirs!
209,INDEX,
210,INDEX,Old women pierced by bayonets grim
211,INDEX,"And babies slaughtered for a whim,"
212,INDEX,"Cathedrals made the sport of shells,"
213,INDEX,"No mercy, even for a child,"
214,INDEX,As though the imps of all the hells
215,INDEX,Were crazed with drink and running wild.
216,INDEX,
217,INDEX,All this we fight--that some day when
218,INDEX,"Good sense shall come again to men,"
219,INDEX,Our children's children may not read
220,INDEX,This age's history thus defamed
221,INDEX,And find we served a selfish creed
222,INDEX,And ever be of us ashamed!
223,INDEX,
224,INDEX,
225,INDEX,
226,INDEX,America
227,INDEX,
228,INDEX,
229,INDEX,God has been good to men. He gave
230,INDEX,"His Only Son their souls to save,"
231,INDEX,"And then he made a second gift,"
232,INDEX,Which from their dreary lives should lift
233,INDEX,The tyrant's yoke and set them free
234,INDEX,From all who'd throttle liberty.
235,INDEX,He gave America to men--
236,INDEX,"Fashioned this land we love, and then"
237,INDEX,Deep in her forests sowed the seed
238,INDEX,Which was to serve man's earthly need.
239,INDEX,
240,INDEX,When wisps of smoke first upwards curled
241,INDEX,"From pilgrim fires, upon the world"
242,INDEX,"Unnoticed and unseen, began"
243,INDEX,God's second work of grace for man.
244,INDEX,"Here where the savage roamed and fought,"
245,INDEX,God sowed the seed of nobler thought;
246,INDEX,"Here to the land we love to claim,"
247,INDEX,The pioneers of freedom came;
248,INDEX,Here has been cradled all that's best
249,INDEX,In every human mind and breast.
250,INDEX,
251,INDEX,For full four hundred years and more
252,INDEX,Our land has stretched her welcoming shore
253,INDEX,To weary feet from soils afar;
254,INDEX,Soul-shackled serfs of king and czar
255,INDEX,Have journeyed here and toiled and sung
256,INDEX,"And talked of freedom to their young,"
257,INDEX,And God above has smiled to see
258,INDEX,"This precious work of liberty,"
259,INDEX,And watched this second gift He gave
260,INDEX,The dreary lives of men to save.
261,INDEX,
262,INDEX,"And now, when liberty's at bay,"
263,INDEX,"And blood-stained tyrants force the fray,"
264,INDEX,"Worn warriors, battling for the right,"
265,INDEX,"Crushed by oppression's cruel might,"
266,INDEX,Hear in the dark through which they grope
267,INDEX,America's glad cry of hope:
268,INDEX,Man's liberty is not to die!
269,INDEX,America is standing by!
270,INDEX,World-wide shall human lives be free:
271,INDEX,America has crossed the sea!
272,INDEX,
273,INDEX,America! the land we love!
274,INDEX,"God's second gift from Heaven above,"
275,INDEX,"Builded and fashioned out of truth,"
276,INDEX,Sinewed by Him with splendid youth
277,INDEX,For that glad day when shall be furled
278,INDEX,All tyrant flags throughout the world.
279,INDEX,For this our banner holds the sky:
280,INDEX,That liberty shall never die.
281,INDEX,"For this, America began:"
282,INDEX,To make a brotherhood of man.
283,INDEX,
284,INDEX,
285,INDEX,
286,INDEX,The Time for Deeds
287,INDEX,
288,INDEX,
289,INDEX,"We have boasted our courage in moments of ease,"
290,INDEX,Our star-spangled banner we've flung on the breeze;
291,INDEX,"We have taught men to cheer for its beauty and worth,"
292,INDEX,And have called it the flag of the bravest on earth
293,INDEX,"Now the dark days are here, we must stand to the test."
294,INDEX,"Oh, God! let us prove we are true to our best!"
295,INDEX,
296,INDEX,"We have drunk to our flag, and we've talked of the right,"
297,INDEX,We have challenged oppression to show us its might;
298,INDEX,We have strutted for years through the world as a race
299,INDEX,"That for God and for country, earth's tyrants would face;"
300,INDEX,"Now the gage is flung down, hate is loosed in the world."
301,INDEX,"Oh, God! shall our flag in dishonor be furled?"
302,INDEX,
303,INDEX,"We have said we are brave; we have preached of the truth,"
304,INDEX,We have walked in conceit of the strength of our youth;
305,INDEX,"We have mocked at the ramparts and guns of the foe,"
306,INDEX,As though we believed we could laugh them all low.
307,INDEX,Now oppression has struck! We are challenged to fight!
308,INDEX,"Oh, God! let us prove we can stand for the right!"
309,INDEX,
310,INDEX,"If in honor and glory our flag is to wave,"
311,INDEX,If we are to keep this--the land of the brave;
312,INDEX,"If more than fine words are to fashion our creeds,"
313,INDEX,Now must our hands and our hearts turn to deeds.
314,INDEX,We are challenged by tyrants our strength to reveal!
315,INDEX,"Oh, God! let us prove that our courage is real!"
316,INDEX,
317,INDEX,
318,INDEX,
319,INDEX,Everywhere in America
320,INDEX,
321,INDEX,
322,INDEX,"Not somewhere in America, but everywhere to-day,"
323,INDEX,"Where snow-crowned mountains hold their heads,"
324,INDEX,"the vales where children play,"
325,INDEX,"Beside the bench and whirring lathe, on every"
326,INDEX,lake and stream
327,INDEX,"And in the depths of earth below, men share a"
328,INDEX,common dream--
329,INDEX,The dream our brave forefathers had of freedom
330,INDEX,"and of right,"
331,INDEX,"And once again in honor's cause, they rally and"
332,INDEX,unite.
333,INDEX,
334,INDEX,Not somewhere in America is love of country
335,INDEX,"found,"
336,INDEX,But east and west and north and south once
337,INDEX,"more the bugles sound,"
338,INDEX,"And once again, as one, men stand to break"
339,INDEX,"their brother's chains,"
340,INDEX,"And make the world a better place, where only"
341,INDEX,justice reigns.
342,INDEX,"The patriotism that is here, is echoed over there,"
343,INDEX,The hero at a certain post is on guard everywhere.
344,INDEX,O'er humble home and mansion rich the starry
345,INDEX,"banner flies,"
346,INDEX,And far and near throughout the land the men
347,INDEX,of valor rise.
348,INDEX,
349,INDEX,The flag that flutters o'er your home is fluttering
350,INDEX,far away
351,INDEX,O'er homes that you have never seen. The same
352,INDEX,impulses sway
353,INDEX,"The souls of men in distant states. The red, the"
354,INDEX,white and blue
355,INDEX,"Means to one hundred million strong, just what"
356,INDEX,it means to you.
357,INDEX,The self-same courage resolute you feel and
358,INDEX,understand
359,INDEX,Is throbbing in the breasts of men throughout
360,INDEX,this mighty land.
361,INDEX,"Not somewhere in America, but everywhere to-day,"
362,INDEX,For justice and for liberty all free men work
363,INDEX,and pray.
364,INDEX,
365,INDEX,
366,INDEX,
367,INDEX,The Things That Make a Soldier Great
368,INDEX,
369,INDEX,
370,INDEX,"The things that make a soldier great and send him out to die,"
371,INDEX,"To face the flaming cannon's mouth, nor ever question why,"
372,INDEX,"Are lilacs by a little porch, the row of tulips red,"
373,INDEX,"The peonies and pansies, too, the old petunia bed,"
374,INDEX,"The grass plot where his children play, the roses on the wall:"
375,INDEX,'Tis these that make a soldier great. He's fighting for them all.
376,INDEX,
377,INDEX,'Tis not the pomp and pride of kings that make a soldier brave;
378,INDEX,'Tis not allegiance to the flag that over him may wave;
379,INDEX,For soldiers never fight so well on land or on the foam
380,INDEX,As when behind the cause they see the little place called home.
381,INDEX,Endanger but that humble street whereon his children run--
382,INDEX,You make a soldier of the man who never bore a gun.
383,INDEX,
384,INDEX,What is it through the battle smoke the valiant soldier sees?
385,INDEX,"The little garden far away, the budding apple trees,"
386,INDEX,"The little patch of ground back there, the children at their play,"
387,INDEX,Perhaps a tiny mound behind the simple church of gray.
388,INDEX,The golden thread of courage isn't linked to castle dome
389,INDEX,"But to the spot, where'er it be--the humble spot called home."
390,INDEX,
391,INDEX,"And now the lilacs bud again and all is lovely there,"
392,INDEX,And homesick soldiers far away know spring is in the air;
393,INDEX,"The tulips come to bloom again, the grass once more is green,"
394,INDEX,And every man can see the spot where all his joys have been.
395,INDEX,"He sees his children smile at him, he hears the bugle call,"
396,INDEX,And only death can stop him now--he's fighting for them all.
397,INDEX,
398,INDEX,
399,INDEX,
400,INDEX,The Flag
401,INDEX,
402,INDEX,
403,INDEX,We never knew how much the Flag
404,INDEX,"Could mean, until he went away,"
405,INDEX,"We used to boast of it and brag,"
406,INDEX,As something of a by-gone day;
407,INDEX,But now the Flag can start our tears
408,INDEX,"In moments of our greatest joy,"
409,INDEX,Old Glory in the sky appears
410,INDEX,The symbol of our little boy.
411,INDEX,
412,INDEX,We knew that sometimes people wept
413,INDEX,"To see the Flag go waving by,"
414,INDEX,But never guessed the griefs they kept--
415,INDEX,We never understood just why.
416,INDEX,"But now our eyes grow quickly dim,"
417,INDEX,Our voices choke with sobs to-day;
418,INDEX,"The Flag is telling us of him,"
419,INDEX,Our little boy who's gone away.
420,INDEX,
421,INDEX,We never knew the Flag could be
422,INDEX,"So much a part of human life,"
423,INDEX,We thought it beautiful to see
424,INDEX,Before these bitter days of strife;
425,INDEX,"But now more beautiful it gleams,"
426,INDEX,And deeper in our hearts it dwells;
427,INDEX,"It is the emblem of our dreams,"
428,INDEX,For of our little boy it tells.
429,INDEX,
430,INDEX,
431,INDEX,
432,INDEX,A Battle Prayer
433,INDEX,
434,INDEX,
435,INDEX,"God of battles, be with us now:"
436,INDEX,"Guard our sons from the lead of shame,"
437,INDEX,"Watch our sons when the cannons flame,"
438,INDEX,Let them not to a tyrant bow.
439,INDEX,
440,INDEX,"God of battles, to Thee we pray:"
441,INDEX,Be with each loyal son who fights
442,INDEX,"In the cause of justice and human rights,"
443,INDEX,Grant him strength and lead the way.
444,INDEX,
445,INDEX,"God of battles, our youth we give"
446,INDEX,"To the battle line on a foreign soil,"
447,INDEX,To conquer hatred and lust and spoil;
448,INDEX,Grant that they and their cause shall live.
449,INDEX,
450,INDEX,
451,INDEX,
452,INDEX,Good Luck
453,INDEX,
454,INDEX,
455,INDEX,"Good luck! That's all I'm saying, as you sail across the sea;"
456,INDEX,"The best o' luck, in the parting, is the prayer you get from me."
457,INDEX,"May you never meet a danger that you won't come safely through,"
458,INDEX,May you never meet a German that can get the best of you;
459,INDEX,"Oh! A thousand things may happen when a fellow's at the front,"
460,INDEX,"A thousand different mishaps, but here's hoping that they won't."
461,INDEX,
462,INDEX,"Good luck! That's all I'm saying, as you turn away to go,"
463,INDEX,"Good luck and plenty of it, may it be your lot to know;"
464,INDEX,"May you never meet rough weather, but remember if you do"
465,INDEX,That the folks at home are wishing that you'll all come safely through.
466,INDEX,Oh! A thousand things may happen when a fellow bears the brunt
467,INDEX,"Of His Country's fight for glory, but I'm praying that they won't."
468,INDEX,
469,INDEX,Good luck! That's all I'm saying as you're falling into line;
470,INDEX,May the splendor of your service bring you everything that's fine;
471,INDEX,"May the fates deal kindly with you, may you never know distress,"
472,INDEX,And may every task you tackle end triumphant with success.
473,INDEX,Oh! A thousand things may happen that with joy your life will fill;
474,INDEX,"You may not get all the gladness, but I'm hoping that you will."
475,INDEX,
476,INDEX,
477,INDEX,
478,INDEX,"A Prayer, 1918"
479,INDEX,
480,INDEX,
481,INDEX,"Oh, make us worthy,"
482,INDEX,"God, we pray,"
483,INDEX,To do thy service
484,INDEX,Here to-day;
485,INDEX,Endow us with
486,INDEX,The strength we need
487,INDEX,For every
488,INDEX,Sacrificial deed!
489,INDEX,
490,INDEX,
491,INDEX,
492,INDEX,The Change
493,INDEX,
494,INDEX,
495,INDEX,"'Twas hard to think that he must go,"
496,INDEX,"We knew that we should miss him so,"
497,INDEX,We thought that he must always stay
498,INDEX,"Beside us, laughing, day by day;"
499,INDEX,That he must never know the care
500,INDEX,And hurt and grief of life out there.
501,INDEX,"Then came the call for youth, and he"
502,INDEX,"Talked with his mother and with me,"
503,INDEX,And suddenly we learned the boy
504,INDEX,Was hungering to know the joy
505,INDEX,"Of doing something real with life,"
506,INDEX,And that he craved the test of strife.
507,INDEX,
508,INDEX,And so we steeled ourselves to dread;
509,INDEX,To see at night his empty bed;
510,INDEX,To feel the silence and the gloom
511,INDEX,"That hovers o'er his vacant room,"
512,INDEX,"And though we wept the day he went,"
513,INDEX,"And many a lonely hour we've spent,"
514,INDEX,"We've come to think as he, somehow,"
515,INDEX,And we are more contented now;
516,INDEX,We're proud that we can stand and say
517,INDEX,We have a boy who's gone away.
518,INDEX,And we are glad to know that he
519,INDEX,Is serving where he ought to be.
520,INDEX,
521,INDEX,"It's queer, the change that time has brought:"
522,INDEX,We're different now in speech and thought;
523,INDEX,"His letters home mean joy to us,"
524,INDEX,His difficulties we discuss.
525,INDEX,"When word of his promotion came,"
526,INDEX,"His mother, with her eyes aflame"
527,INDEX,"With happiness and pride, rushed out"
528,INDEX,To tell the neighbors round about.
529,INDEX,Her boy! Her boy is doing well!
530,INDEX,What greater news can mothers tell?
531,INDEX,I think that pity now we show
532,INDEX,For those who have no boys to go.
533,INDEX,
534,INDEX,
535,INDEX,
536,INDEX,Mothers and Wives
537,INDEX,
538,INDEX,
539,INDEX,"Mothers and wives, 'tis the call to arms"

541,INDEX,We stand on the brink of war's alarms
542,INDEX,And your men may lie on a blood-stained
543,INDEX,ground.
544,INDEX,"The drums may play and the flags may fly,"
545,INDEX,"And our boys may don the brown and blue,"
546,INDEX,And the call that summons brave men to die
547,INDEX,"Is the call for glorious women, too."
548,INDEX,
549,INDEX,"Mothers and wives, if the summons comes,"
550,INDEX,"You, as ever since war has been,"
551,INDEX,Must hear with courage the rolling drums
552,INDEX,And dry your tears when the flags are seen.
553,INDEX,For never has hero fought and died
554,INDEX,"Who has braver been than the mother, who"
555,INDEX,"Buckled his saber at his side,"
556,INDEX,And sent him forward to dare and do.
557,INDEX,
558,INDEX,"Mothers and wives, should the call ring out,"
559,INDEX,It is you must answer your country's cry;
560,INDEX,You must furnish brave hearts and stout
561,INDEX,For the firing line where the heroes die.
562,INDEX,And never a corpse on the field of strife
563,INDEX,Should be honored more in his country's sight
564,INDEX,Than the noble mother or noble wife
565,INDEX,Who sent him forth in the cause of right.
566,INDEX,
567,INDEX,"Mothers and wives, 'tis the call for men"
568,INDEX,To give their strength and to give their lives;
569,INDEX,"But well we know, such a summons then"
570,INDEX,"Is the call for mothers and loyal wives,"
571,INDEX,"For you must give us the strength we need,"
572,INDEX,"You must give us the boys in blue,"

585,INDEX,"No longer selfish ways we tread,"
586,INDEX,The greater task lies just ahead.
587,INDEX,
588,INDEX,These are the days when petty things
589,INDEX,By all men must be thrust aside;

599,INDEX,
600,INDEX,"His name was Kelly Ingram; he was Alabama's son,"
601,INDEX,"And he whistled ""Yankee Doodle,"" as he stood beside his gun;"
602,INDEX,"There was laughter in his make-up, there was manhood in his face,"
603,INDEX,And he knew the best traditions and the courage of his race;
604,INDEX,Now there's not a heart among us but should swell with loyal pride
605,INDEX,When he thinks of Kelly Ingram and the splendid way he died.
606,INDEX,
607,INDEX,"On the swift Destroyer Cassin he was merely gunner's mate,"
608,INDEX,"But up there to-day, I fancy, he is standing with the great."
609,INDEX,On that grim day last October his position on the craft
610,INDEX,Was that portion of the vessel which the sailors christen aft;
611,INDEX,There were deep sea bombs beside him to be dropped upon the Hun
612,INDEX,Who makes women folks his victims and then gloats o'er what he's done.
613,INDEX,
614,INDEX,"From the lookout came a warning; came the cry all sailors fear,"
615,INDEX,"A torpedo was approaching, and the vessel's doom was near;"
616,INDEX,"Ingram saw the streak of danger, but he saw a little more,"
617,INDEX,A greater menace faced them than that missile had in store;
618,INDEX,"If those deep sea bombs beside him were not thrown beneath the wave,"
619,INDEX,Every man aboard the Cassin soon would find a watery grave.
620,INDEX,
621,INDEX,"It was death for him to linger, but he figured if he ran"
622,INDEX,"And quit his post of duty, 'twould be death for every man;"
623,INDEX,"So he stood at his position, threw those depth bombs overboard,"
624,INDEX,"And when that torpedo struck them, he went forth to meet his Lord."
625,INDEX,"Oh, I don't know how to say it, but these whole United States"
626,INDEX,Should remember Kelly Ingram--he who died to save his mates.

637,INDEX,Beyond the dim and distant line the days of

645,INDEX,were happier for it;
646,INDEX,"And now you suffer once again, and bear your"
647,INDEX,weight of sorrow;

650,INDEX,
651,INDEX,"Oh, mother, when the cannons roar and all the"
652,INDEX,"brave are fighting,"
653,INDEX,Remember that the son you bore the wrongs
654,INDEX,of earth is righting;
655,INDEX,Remember through the hours of pain that he

667,INDEX,No extra touch of grief or care
668,INDEX,He'll add unto her heavy load.
669,INDEX,But he will kindly take her arm
670,INDEX,And tender as her son will be;
671,INDEX,He'll lead her from the path of harm
672,INDEX,Because of me.
673,INDEX,
674,INDEX,"Be she the mother of his foe,"
675,INDEX,He will not speak to her in hate;
676,INDEX,My boy will never stoop so low
677,INDEX,As motherhood to desecrate.
678,INDEX,But she shall know what once I knew--
679,INDEX,"Eyes that are glorious to see,"
680,INDEX,The light of manhood shining through--
681,INDEX,Because of me.
682,INDEX,
683,INDEX,"He will salute her as they meet,"

686,INDEX,His last remaining bit of bread.
687,INDEX,She'll find those splendid arms and strong
688,INDEX,"Quick to assist her, tenderly,"

690,INDEX,Because of me.
691,INDEX,
692,INDEX,"I miss his thoughtful, loving care;"

694,INDEX,"But should he meet a mother there,"
695,INDEX,"Helpless and lost in war's grim maze,"
696,INDEX,"She need not fear to take his arm,"
697,INDEX,As though she'd reared him at her knee;

735,INDEX,Along the pathway of his youth to molder in

752,INDEX,"""But I've been through the thick of the thing"
753,INDEX,"and I know when a battle's begun,"
754,INDEX,It isn't the phone you depend on for help. It's
755,INDEX,the legs of a boy who can run.
756,INDEX,
757,INDEX,"""It isn't because of the phone that I'm here."
758,INDEX,To-day you are talking to me
759,INDEX,Because of the grit and the pluck of a boy. His
760,INDEX,title was Runner McGee.
761,INDEX,We were up to our dead line an' fighting alone;
762,INDEX,"some plan had miscarried, I guess,"
763,INDEX,And the help we were promised had failed to

766,INDEX,
767,INDEX,"""Our curtain of fire was ahead of us still, an'"
768,INDEX,"theirs was behind us an' thick,"

770,INDEX,few of us left had to stick.
771,INDEX,You haven't much chance to get central an' talk
772,INDEX,on the phone to the music of guns;
773,INDEX,Gettin' word to the chief is a matter right then
774,INDEX,that is up to the fellow who runs.
775,INDEX,
776,INDEX,"""I'd sent four of 'em back with the R. I. P."
777,INDEX,"sign, which means to return if you can,"
778,INDEX,But none of 'em got through the curtain of fire;
779,INDEX,my hurry call died with the man.
780,INDEX,Then Runner McGee said he'd try to get through.
781,INDEX,I hated to order the kid
782,INDEX,On his mission of death; thought he'd never get
783,INDEX,"by, but somehow or other he did."
784,INDEX,
785,INDEX,"""Yes, he's dead. Died an hour after bringing"

789,INDEX,the reserves would relieve us at night.

794,INDEX,There's heart in the force of your blow.
795,INDEX,
796,INDEX,"""It wasn't till later I got all the facts. They"

799,INDEX,once an' was foolish to try it again.
800,INDEX,"'R. I. P. are my orders,' he answered them all,"

808,INDEX,
809,INDEX,
810,INDEX,We used to think her frivolous--you know how
811,INDEX,"parents are,"
812,INDEX,A little quick to see the faults and petty flaws
813,INDEX,that mar
814,INDEX,The girl their son is fond of and may choose
815,INDEX,"to make his wife,"
816,INDEX,A little overjealous of the one who'd share his
817,INDEX,life;
818,INDEX,But the girl he left behind him when he bravely
819,INDEX,marched away
820,INDEX,Has blossomed into beauty that we see and need
821,INDEX,to-day.
822,INDEX,
823,INDEX,"She was with us at the depot, and we turned our"
824,INDEX,"backs a-while,"
825,INDEX,"And her eyes were sad and misty, though she"

827,INDEX,"Then she put her arm round mother, and it"
828,INDEX,seemed to me as though
829,INDEX,"They just grew to love each other, for they"
830,INDEX,shared a common woe.
831,INDEX,"Now she often comes to see us, and it seems"

839,INDEX,"And I like to have her near us, for she understands"
840,INDEX,my sighs
841,INDEX,And I see my brave boy smiling when I look into
842,INDEX,"her eyes."""
843,INDEX,Now the presence of his sweetheart seems to fill

864,INDEX,"My country, prosperous and free,"
865,INDEX,And passed this heritage to me.
866,INDEX,
867,INDEX,I must always in trouble's hour
868,INDEX,Be guided by the men in power;
869,INDEX,"For God and country I must live,"
870,INDEX,My best for God and country give;
871,INDEX,No act of mine that men may scan
872,INDEX,Must shame the name American.
873,INDEX,
874,INDEX,"To do my best and play my part,"
875,INDEX,American in mind and heart;
876,INDEX,To serve the flag and bravely stand

886,INDEX,His room is as it used to be
887,INDEX,"Before he went away,"
888,INDEX,The walls still keep the pennants he
889,INDEX,Brought home but yesterday.
890,INDEX,The picture of his baseball team
891,INDEX,"Still holds its favored spot,"
892,INDEX,"And oh, it seems a dreadful dream"
893,INDEX,This age of shell and shot!
894,INDEX,
895,INDEX,His golf clubs in the corner stand;
896,INDEX,"His tennis racket, too,"
897,INDEX,That once the pressure of his hand
898,INDEX,In times of laughter knew
899,INDEX,Is in the place it long has kept
900,INDEX,For us to look upon.
901,INDEX,"The room is as it was, except"

903,INDEX,
904,INDEX,"The pictures of his girls are here,"
905,INDEX,"Still smiling as of yore,"

908,INDEX,Into his room his mother goes
909,INDEX,"As usual, day by day,"
910,INDEX,"And cares for it, although she knows"

912,INDEX,
913,INDEX,"We keep it as he left it, when"
914,INDEX,"He bade us all good-bye,"
915,INDEX,"Though I confess that, now and then,"

927,INDEX,It's a bigger thing you're doing than the most of us have done;
928,INDEX,"We have lived the days of pleasure; now the gray days have begun,"
929,INDEX,And upon your manly shoulders fall the burdens of the strife;
930,INDEX,Yours must be the sacrifices of the trial time of life.
931,INDEX,"Oh, I don't know how to say it, but I'll never think of you"
932,INDEX,Without wishing I were sharing in the work you have to do.
933,INDEX,
934,INDEX,"I have never known a moment that was fraught with real care,"
935,INDEX,Save the hurts and griefs of sorrow that all mortals have to bear;
936,INDEX,"With the gay and smiling marchers I have tramped on pleasant ways,"
937,INDEX,And have paid with feeble service for the gladness of my days.
938,INDEX,"But to you has come a summons, yours are days of sacrifice,"
939,INDEX,And for all life has of sweetness you must pay a bitter price.
940,INDEX,
941,INDEX,"Men have fought and died before me, men must fight and die to-day,"
942,INDEX,I have merely taken pleasures for which others had to pay;
943,INDEX,"I have been a man of laughter, there's no path my feet have made,"
944,INDEX,I have merely been a marcher in life's gaudy dress parade.
945,INDEX,"But you wear the garb of service, you have splendid deeds to do,"
946,INDEX,"You shall sound the depths of manhood, and my boy, I envy you."
947,INDEX,
948,INDEX,
949,INDEX,
950,INDEX,For Your Boy and Mine
951,INDEX,
952,INDEX,
953,INDEX,"Your dream and my dream is not that we shall rest,"
954,INDEX,But that our children after us shall know life at its best;
955,INDEX,"For all we care about ourselves--a crust of bread or two,"
956,INDEX,A place to sleep and clothes to wear is all that we'd pursue.
957,INDEX,"We'd tramp the world on sunny days, both light of heart and mind,"
958,INDEX,And give no thought to days to come or days we leave behind.
959,INDEX,
960,INDEX,"Your dream and my dream is not that we shall play,"
961,INDEX,But that our children after us shall tread a merry way.
962,INDEX,"We brave the toil of life for them, for them we clamber high,"
963,INDEX,"And if 'twould spare them hurt and pain, for them we'd gladly die."
964,INDEX,"If we had but ourselves to serve, we'd quit the ways of pride"
965,INDEX,And with the simplest joys of earth we'd all be satisfied.
966,INDEX,
967,INDEX,The best for them is what we dream. Our little girls and boys
968,INDEX,Must know the finest life can give of comforts and of joys.
969,INDEX,"They must be shielded well from woe and kept secure from care,"
970,INDEX,"And if we could, upon our backs, their burdens we would bear."
971,INDEX,And so once more we rise to-day to face the battle zone
972,INDEX,That those who follow us may know the Flag that we have known.
973,INDEX,
974,INDEX,Your dream and my dream is not that we shall live;
975,INDEX,The greatest joys we hope to claim are those that we shall give.
976,INDEX,"We face the heat and strife of life, its battle and its toil"
977,INDEX,That those who follow us may know the best of freedom's soil.
978,INDEX,"And if we knew that by our death we'd keep that flag on high,"

984,INDEX,

986,INDEX,The glory of a soldier--and a soldier's not a saint--
987,INDEX,Is the way he does his duty without grumbling or complaint;
988,INDEX,"His work's not always pleasant, but he does it rain or shine,"
989,INDEX,And he grabs a bit of glory when he's fighting in the line;
990,INDEX,But the lesson that he teaches every day to me an' you
991,INDEX,Is the way to do a duty that we do not like to do.
992,INDEX,
993,INDEX,Any sort o' chap can whistle when his work is mostly fun;
994,INDEX,A hundred want the pleasant jobs to every sturdy one
995,INDEX,"That'll grab the dreary duty an' the mean an' lowly task,"
996,INDEX,Or the drab an' cheerless service that life often has to ask;
997,INDEX,"But somebody has to do it, an' the test of me an' you"
998,INDEX,Is the way we face the labor that we do not like to do.
999,INDEX,
1000,INDEX,"Now, it isn't very pleasant standin' guard out in the rain"
1001,INDEX,"But it's in the line o' duty, an' no soldier will complain,"
1002,INDEX,An' there isn't any soldier but what sometimes hates his work
1003,INDEX,"When the dress parade is over, an' perhaps he'd like to shirk,"
1004,INDEX,"But he's there to follow orders, not to pick an' choose his post,"
1005,INDEX,An' he sometimes shines the finest at the job he hates the most.
1006,INDEX,
1007,INDEX,"Let's be soldiers in the struggle, let's be loyal through and through;"
1008,INDEX,Life is going to give us duties that perhaps we'll hate to do.
1009,INDEX,"There'll be little sacrifices that we will not like to make,"
1010,INDEX,There'll be many tasks unpleasant that will fall to us to take.
1011,INDEX,"An' although we all would rather do the work that brings applause,"

1032,INDEX,For over us that storm shall break
1033,INDEX,"Ere many weeks have fled,"
1034,INDEX,And we shall pay for our mistake
1035,INDEX,In fields of mangled dead.
1036,INDEX,
1037,INDEX,"Be ready when the foe shall near,"

1041,INDEX,To-morrow's victories won't be won

1050,INDEX,
1051,INDEX,"His mother's eyes are saddened, and her cheeks"
1052,INDEX,"are stained with tears,"
1053,INDEX,And I'm facing now the struggle that I've
1054,INDEX,dreaded through the years;
1055,INDEX,For the boy that was our baby has been changed
1056,INDEX,into a man.
1057,INDEX,He's enlisted in the army as a true American.
1058,INDEX,
1059,INDEX,He held her for a moment in his arms before
1060,INDEX,"he spoke,"
1061,INDEX,"And I watched him as he kissed her, and it"
1062,INDEX,"seemed to me I'd choke,"
1063,INDEX,"For I knew just what was coming, and I knew"
1064,INDEX,just what he'd done!
1065,INDEX,'Another little mother had a soldier for a son.
1066,INDEX,
1067,INDEX,"When we'd pulled ourselves together, and the"
1068,INDEX,"first quick tears had dried,"
1069,INDEX,We could see his eyes were blazing with the fire
1070,INDEX,of manly pride;
1071,INDEX,We could see his head was higher than it ever
1072,INDEX,"was before,"
1073,INDEX,"For we had a man to cherish, and our baby was"

1075,INDEX,
1076,INDEX,"Oh, I don't know how to say it! With the sorrow"
1077,INDEX,comes the joy
1078,INDEX,That there isn't any coward in the make-up of
1079,INDEX,our boy.
1080,INDEX,"And with pride our hearts are swelling, though"

1094,INDEX,
1095,INDEX,"Little mother, heed them not--they who preach despair--"

1118,INDEX,A fine accounting let me give.
1119,INDEX,Perhaps to-morrow I shall stand

1122,INDEX,"Oh, God, then bravely let me die!"
1123,INDEX,
1124,INDEX,"If after I shall fall, shall rise"
1125,INDEX,"A fairer land than I have known,"
1126,INDEX,"I shall not grudge my sacrifice,"
1127,INDEX,Although I pay the price alone.
1128,INDEX,If still more beautiful to see
1129,INDEX,The Stars and Stripes o'er men shall wave
1130,INDEX,"And finer shall my country be,"
1131,INDEX,To-morrow let me find my grave.
1132,INDEX,
1133,INDEX,"To-night life seems so fair and sweet,"

1135,INDEX,And hate and lust and foul deceit
1136,INDEX,Hang heavy on the atmosphere.
1137,INDEX,"Injustice seeks to throttle right,"
1138,INDEX,And laughter's stifled to a sigh.
1139,INDEX,If death can take so great a blight
1140,INDEX,"From human lives, then let me die."
1141,INDEX,
1142,INDEX,"If death must be the cost of life,"
1143,INDEX,"And freedom's terms are human souls,"
1144,INDEX,Into the thickest of the strife

1146,INDEX,"I would enrich my native land,"
1147,INDEX,"New splendor to her flag I'd give,"

1154,INDEX,With courage meet the sacrifice.
1155,INDEX,If happiness for ages long

1164,INDEX,
1165,INDEX,We've raised a flagpole on the farm

1168,INDEX,"That seems to cheer the passer-by,"
1169,INDEX,"But more than that, no matter where"
1170,INDEX,"We're laboring in wood and field,"
1171,INDEX,"We turn and see it in the air,"
1172,INDEX,Our promise of a greater yield.
1173,INDEX,It whispers to us all day long
1174,INDEX,"From dawn to dusk: ""Be true, be strong;"
1175,INDEX,Who falters now with plough or hoe
1176,INDEX,"Gives comfort to his country's foe."""
1177,INDEX,
1178,INDEX,It seems to me I've never tried
1179,INDEX,"To do so much about the place,"
1180,INDEX,"Nor been so slow to come inside,"
1181,INDEX,"But since I've got the Flag to face,"
1182,INDEX,Each night when I come home to rest
1183,INDEX,I feel that I must look up there
1184,INDEX,"And say: ""Old Flag, I've done my best,"
1185,INDEX,"To-day I've tried to do my share."""
1186,INDEX,"And sometimes, just to catch the breeze,"
1187,INDEX,"I stop my work, and o'er the trees"
1188,INDEX,Old Glory fairly shouts my way:
1189,INDEX,"""You're shirking far too much to-day!"""
1190,INDEX,
1191,INDEX,"The help have caught the spirit, too;"
1192,INDEX,The hired man takes off his cap

1199,INDEX,"She smiles to hear his gallant brag,"
1200,INDEX,"Then drops a curtsey to the Flag,"

1202,INDEX,A patriotism that is fine.

1224,INDEX,"Men have fought to keep it splendid, men have died to keep it bright,"

1226,INDEX,"'Tis her sacrifice has made it, and once more we ought to pray"
1227,INDEX,For the brave and loyal mother of the boy that goes away.
1228,INDEX,
1229,INDEX,"There are days of grief before her, there are hours that she will weep,"
1230,INDEX,There are nights of anxious waiting when her fear will banish sleep;
1231,INDEX,"She has heard her country calling and has risen to the test,"
1232,INDEX,"And has placed upon the altar of the nation's need, her best."
1233,INDEX,And no man shall ever surfer in the turmoil of the fray
1234,INDEX,The anguish of the mother of the boy who goes away.
1235,INDEX,
1236,INDEX,"You may boast men's deeds of glory, you may tell their courage great,"
1237,INDEX,"But to die is easier service than alone to sit and wait,"
1238,INDEX,"And I hail the little mother, with the tear-stained face and grave"
1239,INDEX,Who has given the Flag a soldier--she's the bravest of the brave.

1283,INDEX,
1284,INDEX,"He is marching with a rifle, he is digging in a trench,"
1285,INDEX,He is swapping English phrases with a poilu for his French;
1286,INDEX,"You will find him in the navy doing anything he  can,"

1363,INDEX,I'd say a dozen times or more.
1364,INDEX,We laughed until the teardrops fell
1365,INDEX,At all the fun he had to tell.
1366,INDEX,"He's in the navy, wearing blue,"
1367,INDEX,And everything is all so new
1368,INDEX,That he can see in youthful style
1369,INDEX,The funny things to make us smile.
1370,INDEX,
1371,INDEX,He's working hard! Between the lines
1372,INDEX,We gather that. The brass he shines
1373,INDEX,"Without complaining, and the food"
1374,INDEX,He gets to eat is very crude.
1375,INDEX,And yet he laughs at all his chores.
1376,INDEX,He says the maid who scrubs our floors
1377,INDEX,Will have to quit when he returns
1378,INDEX,Unless a better way she learns.
1379,INDEX,"""I've got it on the fairer sex,"""
1380,INDEX,"Says he, ""since I am swabbing decks."""
1381,INDEX,
1382,INDEX,"""A sailor's life, dear Mom,"" writes he,"
1383,INDEX,"""Is not the life you picked for me."
1384,INDEX,And yet I'm getting fat and strong
1385,INDEX,And learning as I go along
1386,INDEX,That any life a man can find
1387,INDEX,Is apt to grow to be a grind
1388,INDEX,Unless a fellow has the wit
1389,INDEX,To see the brighter side of it.
1390,INDEX,Don't worry for your sailor son;
1391,INDEX,"He sleeps well when his work is done."""
1392,INDEX,
1393,INDEX,"We've had a letter from the boy,"
1394,INDEX,"And oh, the gladness and the joy"
1395,INDEX,It brought to us! 'Twas good to know
1396,INDEX,That he is facing duty so.
1397,INDEX,Between the lines that he had penned
1398,INDEX,"His mother's bitter fears to end,"
1399,INDEX,"I saw his manhood glowing bright,"
1400,INDEX,And now I know his heart is right.
1401,INDEX,Behind the laughter I could see

1430,INDEX,As a citizen and soldier--an example of the best.
1431,INDEX,"You've a harder task before you than the boys who're fighting for you,"

1490,INDEX,God help us to be true
1491,INDEX,Until that glorious morning when
1492,INDEX,The world shall smile anew.
1493,INDEX,"We shall be tested sore and tried,"
1494,INDEX,"And flayed by many fears,"
1495,INDEX,"Yet let us in this faith abide,"
1496,INDEX,That right shall rule the years.

1500,INDEX,Sympathy
1501,INDEX,
1502,INDEX,
1503,INDEX,One came to the house with a pretty speech:
1504,INDEX,"""It's all for the best,"" said he,"
1505,INDEX,"And I know that he sought my heart to reach,"
1506,INDEX,And I know that he grieved with me.
1507,INDEX,
1508,INDEX,But I was too full of my sorrow then
1509,INDEX,To list to his words or care;
1510,INDEX,Though I've tried I cannot recall again
1511,INDEX,The comfort he gave me there.
1512,INDEX,
1513,INDEX,"But another came, and his lips were dumb"
1514,INDEX,"As he grasped me by the hand,"
1515,INDEX,"And he stammered: ""Old man, I had to come,"
1516,INDEX,"Oh, I hope you'll understand."""
1517,INDEX,
1518,INDEX,And ever since then I have felt his hand
1519,INDEX,"Clasped tightly in my own,"
1520,INDEX,And to-day his silence I understand--
1521,INDEX,My sorrowing he had known.

1525,INDEX,Hate
1526,INDEX,
1527,INDEX,
1528,INDEX,"They say we must not hate, nor fight in hate."
1529,INDEX,"I've thought it over many a solemn hour,"
1530,INDEX,And cannot mildly view the man or state
1531,INDEX,"That has no thought, save only to be great;"
1532,INDEX,I cannot love the creature drunk with power.
1533,INDEX,"I hate the hand that slaughters babes at sea,"
1534,INDEX,I hate that will that orders wives to die.
1535,INDEX,And there is something rises up in me
1536,INDEX,When brutes run wild in crime and lechery
1537,INDEX,That soft adjustments will not satisfy.
1538,INDEX,
1539,INDEX,Men seldom fight the things they do not hate;
1540,INDEX,A vice grows strong on mildly tempered scorn;
1541,INDEX,Rank thrives the weed the gardeners tolerate;
1542,INDEX,"You cannot stroke the snake that lies in wait,"
1543,INDEX,And change his nature with to-morrow's morn.
1544,INDEX,"If roses are to bloom, the weeds must go;"
1545,INDEX,Vice be dethroned if virtue is to reign;
1546,INDEX,"Honor and shame together cannot grow,"
1547,INDEX,"Sin either conquers or we lay it low,"
1548,INDEX,Wrong must be hated if the truth remain.
1549,INDEX,
1550,INDEX,I hold that we must fight this war in hate--
1551,INDEX,In bitter hate of blood in fury spilled;
1552,INDEX,"Of children, bending over book and slate,"
1553,INDEX,Slaughtered to make a Prussian despot great;
1554,INDEX,In hate of mothers pitilessly killed.
1555,INDEX,In hate of liars plotting wars for gain;
1556,INDEX,In hate of crimes too black for printed page;
1557,INDEX,In hate of wrongs that mark the tyrant's reign--
1558,INDEX,And crush forever all within his train.
1559,INDEX,Such hate shall be the glory of our age.

1564,INDEX,
1565,INDEX,
1566,INDEX,"He isn't long on speeches. At the banquet table, he"
1567,INDEX,Could name a dozen places where he would much rather be.
1568,INDEX,"He's not one for fuss and feathers or for marching in review,"
1569,INDEX,But he's busy every minute when he's got a job to do.
1570,INDEX,"And you'll find him in the open, fighting hard and fighting square"
1571,INDEX,For the glory of his country when his boys get over there.
1572,INDEX,
1573,INDEX,"He has listened to the cheering of the splendid folks of France,"
1574,INDEX,"And he knows that he's the leader of America's advance,"
1575,INDEX,"And he knows his task is mighty and that words will not avail,"
1576,INDEX,"So he's standing to his duty, for he isn't there to fail."
1577,INDEX,"And you'll find him cool and steady when the guns begin to flare,"
1578,INDEX,And he'll talk in deeds of glory when his boys get over there.
1579,INDEX,
1580,INDEX,He has gone to face the fury of the Prussian hordes that sweep
1581,INDEX,"O'er the fertile fields of Freedom, where the forms of heroes sleep,"
1582,INDEX,"And it seems no time for talking or for laughter or for cheers,"
1583,INDEX,With the wounded all about him and their moaning in his ears.
1584,INDEX,"He is waiting for to-morrow, waiting there to do his share,"
1585,INDEX,And he'll strike a blow for freedom when his boys get over there.

1589,INDEX,The Better Thing
1590,INDEX,
1591,INDEX,
1592,INDEX,"It is better to die for the flag,"
1593,INDEX,"For its red and its white and its blue,"
1594,INDEX,Than to hang back and shirk and to lag
1595,INDEX,And let the flag sink out of view.
1596,INDEX,It is better to give up this life
1597,INDEX,In the heat and the thick of the strife
1598,INDEX,"Than to live out your days 'neath a sky,"
1599,INDEX,Where Old Glory shall never more fly.
1600,INDEX,
1601,INDEX,The peace that we long for will be
1602,INDEX,Far worse than the war that we dread
1603,INDEX,If never again we're to see
1604,INDEX,"The blue, and the white and the red"
1605,INDEX,Wind-tossed and sun-kissed in the skies.
1606,INDEX,If ever the Stars and Stripes dies
1607,INDEX,"Or loses its lustre and pride,"
1608,INDEX,We shall wish in our souls we had died.
1609,INDEX,
1610,INDEX,It is better by far that we die
1611,INDEX,Than that flag shall pass out of the world;
1612,INDEX,"If ever it ceases to fly,"
1613,INDEX,"If ever it's hauled down and furled,"
1614,INDEX,Dishonor shall stamp us with shame
1615,INDEX,"And freedom be naught but a name,"
1616,INDEX,And the few years of dearly-bought breath
1617,INDEX,Will be filled with worse horrors than death.

1622,INDEX,
1623,INDEX,
1624,INDEX,"Little woman, hourly sitting,"
1625,INDEX,"Something for a soldier knitting,"
1626,INDEX,What in fancy can you see?
1627,INDEX,Many pictures come to me
1628,INDEX,Through the stitch that now you're making:
1629,INDEX,I behold a bullet breaking;
1630,INDEX,I can see some soldier lying
1631,INDEX,"In that garment slowly dying,"
1632,INDEX,And that very bit of thread
1633,INDEX,"In your fingers, turns to red."
1634,INDEX,Gray to-day; perhaps to-morrow
1635,INDEX,Crimsoned by the blood of sorrow.
1636,INDEX,
1637,INDEX,It may be some hero daring
1638,INDEX,Shall that very thing be wearing
1639,INDEX,When he ventures forth to give
1640,INDEX,Life that other men may live.
1641,INDEX,He may braver wield the saber
1642,INDEX,"As a tribute to your labor,"
1643,INDEX,"And for that, which you have knitted,"
1644,INDEX,Better for his task be fitted.
1645,INDEX,"When the thread has left your finger,"
1646,INDEX,"Something of yourself may linger,"
1647,INDEX,Something of your lovely beauty
1648,INDEX,May sustain him in his duty.
1649,INDEX,
1650,INDEX,Some one's boy that was a baby
1651,INDEX,"Soon shall wear it, and it may be"
1652,INDEX,He will write and tell his mother
1653,INDEX,"Of the kindness of another,"
1654,INDEX,"And her spirit shall caress you,"
1655,INDEX,And her prayers at night shall bless you.
1656,INDEX,"You may never know its story,"
1657,INDEX,Cannot know the grief or glory
1658,INDEX,That are destined now and hover
1659,INDEX,"Over him your wool shall cover,"
1660,INDEX,Nor what spirit shall invade it
1661,INDEX,Once your gentle hands have made it.
1662,INDEX,
1663,INDEX,"Little woman, hourly sitting,"
1664,INDEX,"Something for a soldier knitting,"
1665,INDEX,"'Tis no common garb you're making,"
1666,INDEX,"These, no common pains you're taking."
1667,INDEX,"Something lovely, holy, lingers"
1668,INDEX,O'er the needles in your fingers
1669,INDEX,And with every stitch you're weaving
1670,INDEX,Something of yourself you're leaving.
1671,INDEX,From your gentle hands and tender
1672,INDEX,"There may come a nation's splendor,"
1673,INDEX,"And from this, your simple duty,"
1674,INDEX,Life may win a fairer beauty.

1679,INDEX,
1680,INDEX,
1681,INDEX,"He writes to us most every day, and how his letters thrill us!"
1682,INDEX,I can't describe the joys with which his quaint expressions fill us.
1683,INDEX,"He says the military life is not of his selection,"
1684,INDEX,He's only soldiering to-day to give the Flag protection.
1685,INDEX,"But since he's in the army now and doing duties humble,"
1686,INDEX,"He'll do what all good soldiers must, and he will never grumble."
1687,INDEX,
1688,INDEX,"He's not so keen for standing guard, a lonely vigil keeping,"
1689,INDEX,"""But when I must,"" he writes to us, ""they'll never find me sleeping!"
1690,INDEX,I hear a lot of boys complain about the tasks they set us
1691,INDEX,"And there's no doubt that mother's meals can beat the ones they get us,"
1692,INDEX,"But since I'm here to do my bit, close to the job I'm sticking;"
1693,INDEX,I'll take whatever comes my way and waste no word in kicking.
1694,INDEX,
1695,INDEX,"""I'd like to be a captain, dad, a major or a colonel,"
1696,INDEX,I'd like to get my picture in some illustrated journal;
1697,INDEX,"I don't exactly fancy jobs that now and then come my way,"
1698,INDEX,Like picking bits of rubbish up that desecrate the highway.
1699,INDEX,"But still I'll do those menial tasks as cheerfully as could one,"
1700,INDEX,For while I am a private here I'm going to be a good one.
1701,INDEX,
1702,INDEX,"""A soldier's life is not the way I'd choose to make my living,"
1703,INDEX,"But now I'm in the ranks to serve, my best to it I'm giving."
1704,INDEX,"Oh, I could name a dozen jobs that I'd consider finer,"
1705,INDEX,But since I've got this one to do I'll never be a whiner.
1706,INDEX,"I'm just a private in the ranks, but take it from my letter,"
1707,INDEX,"They'll never fire your son for one who'll do his duty better."""

1712,INDEX,
1713,INDEX,
1714,INDEX,"He will not come to him this year with all his old-time joy,"
1715,INDEX,An imitation Santa Claus must serve his little boy;
1716,INDEX,"Last year he heard the reindeers paw the roof above his head,"
1717,INDEX,"And as he dreamed the kindly saint tip-toed about his bed,"
1718,INDEX,But Christmas Eve he will not come by any happy chance;
1719,INDEX,This year his kindly Santa Claus must guard a trench in France.
1720,INDEX,
1721,INDEX,His mother bravely tries to smile; last Christmas Eve was gay;
1722,INDEX,Last Christmas morn his daddy rose at dawn with him to play;
1723,INDEX,"This year he'll hang his stocking by the chimney, but the hands"
1724,INDEX,That filled it with the joys he craved now serve in foreign lands.
1725,INDEX,"He is too young to understand his mother's troubled glance,"
1726,INDEX,But he that was his Santa Claus is in a trench in France.
1727,INDEX,
1728,INDEX,"Somewhere in France this Christmas Eve a soldier brave will be,"
1729,INDEX,And all that night in fancy he will trim a Christmas tree;
1730,INDEX,And all that night he'll live again the joys that once he had
1731,INDEX,When he was good St. Nicholas unto a certain lad.
1732,INDEX,"And he will wonder if his boy, by any sad mischance,"
1733,INDEX,Will find his stocking empty just because he serves in France.

1740,INDEX,Show the flag and let it wave
1741,INDEX,As a symbol of the brave;
1742,INDEX,Let it float upon the breeze
1743,INDEX,As a sign for each who sees
1744,INDEX,"That beneath it, where it rides,"
1745,INDEX,Loyalty to-day abides.
1746,INDEX,
1747,INDEX,Show the flag and signify
1748,INDEX,That it wasn't born to die;
1749,INDEX,Let its colors speak for you
1750,INDEX,"That you still are standing true,"
1751,INDEX,True in sight of God and man
1752,INDEX,To the work that flag began.
1753,INDEX,
1754,INDEX,Show the flag that all may see
1755,INDEX,That you serve humanity.
1756,INDEX,Let it whisper to the breeze
1757,INDEX,That comes singing through the trees
1758,INDEX,That whatever storms descend
1759,INDEX,You'll be faithful to the end.
1760,INDEX,
1761,INDEX,"Show the flag and let it fly,"
1762,INDEX,Cheering every passer-by--Men
1763,INDEX,"that may have stepped aside,"
1764,INDEX,"May have lost their old-time pride,"
1765,INDEX,"May behold it there, and then"
1766,INDEX,Consecrate themselves again.
1767,INDEX,
1768,INDEX,Show the flag! The day is gone
1769,INDEX,When men blindly hurry on
1770,INDEX,Serving only gods of gold;
1771,INDEX,Now the spirit that was cold
1772,INDEX,Warms again to courage fine.

1781,INDEX,"God watch them when they sleep at night, and guard them through the day."
1782,INDEX,"We've stamped their names upon our walls, the list in glory grows,"
1783,INDEX,Our brave boys and our splendid boys who stand to meet our foes.
1784,INDEX,
1785,INDEX,"Oh, here are sons of mothers fair and fathers fine and true,"
1786,INDEX,"The little ones of yesterday, the children that we knew;"
1787,INDEX,"We thought of them as youngsters gay, still laughing at their games,"
1788,INDEX,And then we found the honor roll emblazoned with their names.
1789,INDEX,
1790,INDEX,We missed their laughter and their cheer; it seems but yesterday
1791,INDEX,"We had them here to walk with us, and now they've marched away."
1792,INDEX,And here where once their smiles were seen we keep a printed scroll;
1793,INDEX,The absent boy we long to see is on the honor roll.
1794,INDEX,
1795,INDEX,"So quickly did the summons come we scarcely marked the change,"
1796,INDEX,"One day life marched its normal pace, the next all things seemed strange,"
1797,INDEX,"And when we questioned where they were, the sturdiest of us all,"
1798,INDEX,We saw the silent honor roll on each familiar wall.
1799,INDEX,
1800,INDEX,The laughter that we knew has gone; the merry voice of youth
1801,INDEX,"No longer rings where graybeards sit, discussing sombre truth."
1802,INDEX,"No longer jests are flung about to rouse our weary souls,"
1803,INDEX,For they who meant so much to us are on our honor rolls.

1813,INDEX,A blend of the old and the new;
1814,INDEX,A bit of the pioneer splendor
1815,INDEX,"That opened the wilderness' flats,"
1816,INDEX,"A touch of the home-lover, tender,"
1817,INDEX,You'll find in the boys they call Pats.
1818,INDEX,
1819,INDEX,"The glory and grace of the maple,"
1820,INDEX,"The strength that is born of the wheat,"
1821,INDEX,"The pride of a stock that is staple,"
1822,INDEX,The bronze of a midsummer heat;
1823,INDEX,"A blending of wisdom and daring,"
1824,INDEX,"The best of a new land, and that's"
1825,INDEX,The regiment gallantly bearing
1826,INDEX,The neat little title of Pats.
1827,INDEX,
1828,INDEX,A bit of the man who has neighbored
1829,INDEX,"With mountains and forests and streams,"
1830,INDEX,A touch of the man who has labored
1831,INDEX,To model and fashion his dreams;
1832,INDEX,"The strength of an age of clean living,"
1833,INDEX,"Of right-minded fatherly chats,"
1834,INDEX,The best that a land could be giving
1835,INDEX,Is there in the breasts of the Pats.

1841,INDEX,
1842,INDEX,Time was the cry went round the world:
1843,INDEX,"America for freedom speaks,"
1844,INDEX,"A new flag is to-day unfurled,"
1845,INDEX,"An eagle on the mountain shrieks,"
1846,INDEX,"A king is failing on his throne,"
1847,INDEX,A race of men defies his power!
1848,INDEX,And no one could have guessed or known
1849,INDEX,The burden of that splendid hour.
1850,INDEX,
1851,INDEX,A bell rang out that summer day
1852,INDEX,And men and women stood and heard;
1853,INDEX,That tongue of brass had more to say
1854,INDEX,Than could be spoken by a word.
1855,INDEX,"It spoke the thoughts of honest men,"
1856,INDEX,It whispered Destiny's intents
1857,INDEX,And rang a warning loudly then
1858,INDEX,To Kings of all the continents.
1859,INDEX,
1860,INDEX,The old bell in its holy loft
1861,INDEX,"Where pigeons nest, has ceased to swing"
1862,INDEX,And yet through many a day and oft
1863,INDEX,A weary people hear it sing.
1864,INDEX,"That hour long years ago, when first"
1865,INDEX,"America for freedom fought,"
1866,INDEX,The bonds of slavery were burst:
1867,INDEX,That hour began the reign of thought.
1868,INDEX,
1869,INDEX,Here comes another summer day:
1870,INDEX,"America is on the sea,"
1871,INDEX,America has dared to say
1872,INDEX,That other people shall be free.
1873,INDEX,"No selfish stain her banner mars,"
1874,INDEX,"Her flag, for truth and right, unfurled,"
1875,INDEX,With every stripe and all its stars
1876,INDEX,Still speaks its message to the world
1877,INDEX,
1878,INDEX,"Out where the soldiers fight for men,"
1879,INDEX,"Out where, for others, heroes die,"
1880,INDEX,"Out where they storm the Tyrant's den,"
1881,INDEX,The Starry Banner lights the sky.
1882,INDEX,And once again the cry goes out
1883,INDEX,That brings the flush of hope to cheeks
1884,INDEX,Grown pale by bitter war and doubt:

1896,INDEX,
1897,INDEX,"But it's tramp, tramp, tramp,"

1899,INDEX,"And when you see a stranger's kids,"
1900,INDEX,Pretend that you are blind.
1901,INDEX,
1902,INDEX,"The spring is coming back again, the birds begin to mate;"

1905,INDEX,With laughing eyes and little hands about to bless the toil.
1906,INDEX,
1907,INDEX,"But it's fight, fight, fight,"

1909,INDEX,A soldier thinking thoughts of home
1910,INDEX,Is one more soldier sick.
1911,INDEX,
1912,INDEX,Last year I brought the bulbs to bloom and saw the roses bud;

1921,INDEX,
1922,INDEX,"Oh, who will tend the roses now and who will sow the seeds?"
1923,INDEX,And who will do the heavy work the little garden needs?
1924,INDEX,"And who will tell the lad of mine the things he wants to know,"
1925,INDEX,And take his hand and lead him round the paths we used to go?
1926,INDEX,
1927,INDEX,"For it's charge, charge, charge,"
1928,INDEX,And it's face the foe once more;
1929,INDEX,Forget the things you love the most
1930,INDEX,And keep your mind on war.

1941,INDEX,
1942,INDEX,"His speech is soft and vibrant with the messages of truth,"
1943,INDEX,And he says some things of duty that I cannot understand;
1944,INDEX,"It may be that I'm selfish, but this ending of his youth"
1945,INDEX,Is not the dream I cherished and it's not the thing I planned.
1946,INDEX,
1947,INDEX,I only know he's bigger in his uniform to-day
1948,INDEX,"Than I, who stand and watch him as he drills, have ever been;"

1952,INDEX,"I wish I felt as he does, wish I had his sense of right;"
1953,INDEX,With the vision he possesses I should be supremely glad;

1965,INDEX,Save the fact that I'm here and am happy and well.
1966,INDEX,The French people cheered as we marched from our ship
1967,INDEX,At the close of a really remarkable trip;
1968,INDEX,"They danced and they screamed and they shouted and ran,"
1969,INDEX,And I blush as I write. I was kissed by a man!
1970,INDEX,
1971,INDEX,"""I've seen a great deal since I bade you good-bye,"
1972,INDEX,I have witnessed a battle far up in the sky;
1973,INDEX,"I have heard the dull roar of a long line of guns,"
1974,INDEX,And seen the destruction that's worked by the Huns;
1975,INDEX,"Some scenes I'll remember, and some I'll forget,"
1976,INDEX,But the welcome he gave me! I'm feeling it yet.
1977,INDEX,"Oh, try to imagine your boy if you can,"

1980,INDEX,"""'Ah, Meestaire!' he cried in a voice that was shrill,"

1983,INDEX,"Just what he was up to, about me he threw"
1984,INDEX,"His arms, and he hugged me, and then with a squeak,"
1985,INDEX,He planted a chaste little kiss on each cheek.
1986,INDEX,He was stocky and strong and his whiskers were tan.

1998,INDEX,

2028,INDEX,
2029,INDEX,"His mother's tenderness is there, his father's kindly way,"
2030,INDEX,And all that went last year to make his merry Christmas Day;

2041,INDEX,A Plea
2042,INDEX,
2043,INDEX,
2044,INDEX,God grant me these: the strength to do
2045,INDEX,Some needed service here;
2046,INDEX,The wisdom to be brave and true;
2047,INDEX,"The gift of vision clear,"
2048,INDEX,That in each task that comes to me
2049,INDEX,Some purpose I may plainly see.
2050,INDEX,
2051,INDEX,God teach me to believe that I
2052,INDEX,"Am stationed at a post,"
2053,INDEX,"Although the humblest 'neath the sky,"
2054,INDEX,"Where I am needed most,"
2055,INDEX,"And that, at last, if I do well,"
2056,INDEX,My humble services will tell.
2057,INDEX,
2058,INDEX,"God grant me faith to stand on guard,"
2059,INDEX,"Uncheered, unspoke, alone,"
2060,INDEX,And see behind such duty hard
2061,INDEX,My service to the throne.
2062,INDEX,"Whate'er my task, be this my creed:"

2073,INDEX,Somewhere for you it has a place.
2074,INDEX,Not all the slackers dodge the work
2075,INDEX,"Of service where the cannon lurk,"
2076,INDEX,Not all the slackers on life's stage
2077,INDEX,Are boys of military age.
2078,INDEX,"The old, the youthful and unfit"
2079,INDEX,Must also do their little bit.
2080,INDEX,
2081,INDEX,"The country needs a man like you,"
2082,INDEX,'Twill suffer if you prove untrue.
2083,INDEX,What though you cannot bear a gun?
2084,INDEX,That isn't all that's to be done.
2085,INDEX,There are a thousand other ways
2086,INDEX,To serve your country through the days
2087,INDEX,Of trial and the nights of storm.
2088,INDEX,You need not wear a uniform
2089,INDEX,Or with the men in council sit
2090,INDEX,To serve the Flag and do your bit.
2091,INDEX,
2092,INDEX,"Somewhere for you there is a place,"
2093,INDEX,Somewhere you have a task to face.
2094,INDEX,There's none so helpless or so frail
2095,INDEX,"That cannot, when our foes assail,"
2096,INDEX,In some way help our common cause
2097,INDEX,And be deserving of applause.

2100,INDEX,"That in so far as he has striven,"
2101,INDEX,His best was to his country given.
2102,INDEX,
2103,INDEX,"You can be patient, brave and strong,"
2104,INDEX,And not complain when plans go wrong;
2105,INDEX,"You can be cheerful at your toil,"
2106,INDEX,"Or till, perhaps, some patch of soil;"
2107,INDEX,You can encourage others who
2108,INDEX,"Have heavier, greater tasks to do;"
2109,INDEX,"You can be loyal, not in creed"

2116,INDEX,A Creed
2117,INDEX,
2118,INDEX,
2119,INDEX,To keep in mind from day to day
2120,INDEX,That I'm a soldier in the fray;

2122,INDEX,As well as he who bears a gun
2123,INDEX,"The flag that flies above us all,"
2124,INDEX,And answer well my Country's call.
2125,INDEX,
2126,INDEX,I must not for one hour forget
2127,INDEX,Unto the Stars and Stripes my debt.
2128,INDEX,"'Twas spotless on' my day of birth,"
2129,INDEX,And when at last I quit this earth
2130,INDEX,Old Glory still must spotless be
2131,INDEX,For all who follow after me.
2132,INDEX,
2133,INDEX,At some post where my work will fit
2134,INDEX,I must with courage do my bit;
2135,INDEX,Some portion of myself I'd give
2136,INDEX,That freedom and the Flag may live.
2137,INDEX,And in some way I want to feel
2138,INDEX,That I am doing service real.
2139,INDEX,
2140,INDEX,I must in all I say and do
2141,INDEX,"Respect the red, the white and blue',"
2142,INDEX,Nor dim with petty deeds of shame
2143,INDEX,The splendor of Old Glory's fame;
2144,INDEX,"I must not let my standards drag,"
2145,INDEX,For my disgrace would stain the Flag.

2149,INDEX,The Struggle
2150,INDEX,
2151,INDEX,
2152,INDEX,"Life is a struggle for peace,"
2153,INDEX,"A longing for rest,"
2154,INDEX,"A hope for the battles to cease,"
2155,INDEX,A dream for the best;
2156,INDEX,And he is not living who stays
2157,INDEX,"Contented with things,"
2158,INDEX,Unconcerned with the work of the days
2159,INDEX,And all that it brings.
2160,INDEX,
2161,INDEX,"He is dead who sees nothing to change,"
2162,INDEX,No wrong to make right;
2163,INDEX,Who travels no new way or strange
2164,INDEX,In search of the light;
2165,INDEX,Who never sets out for a goal
2166,INDEX,That he sees from afar
2167,INDEX,But contents his indifferent soul
2168,INDEX,With things as they are.
2169,INDEX,
2170,INDEX,Life isn't rest--it is toil;
2171,INDEX,It is building a dream;
2172,INDEX,It is tilling a parcel of soil
2173,INDEX,Or bridging a stream;
2174,INDEX,It's pursuing the light of a star
2175,INDEX,"That but dimly we see,"
2176,INDEX,And in wresting from things as they are
2177,INDEX,The joy that should be.
2178,INDEX,

2183,INDEX,
2184,INDEX,"His comrades have enlisted, but his mother bids him stay,"
2185,INDEX,"His soul is sick with coward shame, his head hangs low to-day,"
2186,INDEX,"His eyes no longer sparkle, and his breast is void of pride"
2187,INDEX,And I think that she has lost him though she's kept him at her side.
2188,INDEX,"Oh, I'm sorry for the mother, but I'm sorrier for the lad"
2189,INDEX,Who must look on life forever as a hopeless dream and sad.
2190,INDEX,
2191,INDEX,"He must fancy men are sneering as they see him walk the street,"
2192,INDEX,He will feel his cheeks turn crimson as his eyes another's meet;
2193,INDEX,"And the boys and girls that knew him as he was but yesterday,"
2194,INDEX,"Will not seem to smile upon him, in the old familiar way."
2195,INDEX,"He will never blame his mother, but when he's alone at night,"
2196,INDEX,His thoughts will flock to tell him that he isn't doing right.
2197,INDEX,
2198,INDEX,"Oh, I'm sorry for the mother from whose side a boy must go,"
2199,INDEX,"And the strong desire to keep him that she feels, I think I know,"
2200,INDEX,"But the boy that she's so fond of has a life to live on earth,"
2201,INDEX,And he hungers to be busy with the work that is of worth.
2202,INDEX,"He will sicken and grow timid, he'll be flesh without a heart"
2203,INDEX,"Until death at last shall claim him, if he doesn't do his part."
2204,INDEX,
2205,INDEX,"Have you kept him, gentle mother? Has he lost his old-time cheer?"
2206,INDEX,"Is he silent, sad and sullen? Are his eyes no longer clear?"
2207,INDEX,Is he growing weak and flabby who but yesterday was strong?
2208,INDEX,Then a secret grief he's nursing and I'll tell you what is wrong.
2209,INDEX,"All his comrades have departed on their country's noblest work,"
2210,INDEX,And he hungers to be with them--it is not his wish to shirk.
2211,INDEX,
2212,INDEX,
2213,INDEX,
2214,INDEX,Fly a Clean Flag
2215,INDEX,
2216,INDEX,
2217,INDEX,This I heard the Old Flag say
2218,INDEX,As I passed it yesterday:
2219,INDEX,"""Months ago your friendly hands"
2220,INDEX,Fastened me on slender strands
2221,INDEX,And with patriotic love
2222,INDEX,Placed me here to wave above
2223,INDEX,You and yours. I heard you say
2224,INDEX,On that long departed day:
2225,INDEX,"'Flag of all that's true and fine,"
2226,INDEX,Wave above this house of mine;
2227,INDEX,Be the first at break of day
2228,INDEX,And the last at night to say
2229,INDEX,To the world this word of cheer:
2230,INDEX,Loyalty abideth here.'
2231,INDEX,
2232,INDEX,"""Here on every wind that's blown,"
2233,INDEX,"O'er your"" portal I have flown;"
2234,INDEX,"Rain and snow have battered me,"
2235,INDEX,Storms at night have tattered me;
2236,INDEX,Dust of street and chimney stack
2237,INDEX,"Day by day have stained me black,"
2238,INDEX,"And I've watched you passing there,"
2239,INDEX,Wondering how much you care.
2240,INDEX,"Have you noticed that your flag,"
2241,INDEX,Is to-day a wind-blown rag?
2242,INDEX,Has your love so careless grown
2243,INDEX,By the long neglect you've shown
2244,INDEX,That you never raise your eye
2245,INDEX,"To the symbol that you fly?"""
2246,INDEX,
2247,INDEX,"""Flag, on which no stain has been,"
2248,INDEX,"'Tis my sin that you're unclean,"""
2249,INDEX,Then I answered in my shame.
2250,INDEX,"""On my head must lie the blame."
2251,INDEX,Now with patriotic hands
2252,INDEX,"I release you from your strands,"
2253,INDEX,And a spotless flag shall fly
2254,INDEX,Here to greet each passer-by.
2255,INDEX,Nevermore shall Flag of mine
2256,INDEX,Be a sad and sorry sign
2257,INDEX,Telling all who look above
2258,INDEX,I neglect the thing I love.
2259,INDEX,But my Flag of faith shall be
2260,INDEX,"Fit for every eye to see."""

2265,INDEX,
2266,INDEX,
2267,INDEX,If it's wrong to believe in the land that we love

2269,INDEX,If it's wrong to believe that Our Country is best;
2270,INDEX,"That honor's her standard, and truth is her crest;"
2271,INDEX,If placing her first in our prayers and our song
2272,INDEX,"Is false to true reason, we're glad to be wrong."
2273,INDEX,
2274,INDEX,If it's wrong to wish victory day after day
2275,INDEX,For the troops of Our Country now marching away;
2276,INDEX,If it's wrong to believe they are moved by the right
2277,INDEX,And not by the love and the lure of the fight;
2278,INDEX,If to cheer them to battle and bid them be strong
2279,INDEX,"Is false to right thinking, then let us be wrong."
2280,INDEX,
2281,INDEX,If it's wrong to believe in America's dreams
2282,INDEX,Of a freedom on earth that's as real as it seems;
2283,INDEX,"If it's error to cherish the hope, through and through,"
2284,INDEX,That the Stars in Old Glory's immaculate blue
2285,INDEX,"Shall shine through the ages, true beacons to men,"

2295,INDEX,"The war was, O, so distant then, the grief so far away,"
2296,INDEX,"We couldn't see the weeping eyes, nor hear the women pray."
2297,INDEX,"We couldn't sense the weight of woe that rested on that land,"
2298,INDEX,"But now our boy is called to go--to-day, we understand."
2299,INDEX,
2300,INDEX,"There, some have heard the blackest news that o'er the wires has sped,"
2301,INDEX,And some are living day by day beneath the clouds of dread;
2302,INDEX,"Some fear the worst; some know the worst, but every heart is chilled,"
2303,INDEX,And every soul is sorrow touched and laughter there is stilled.
2304,INDEX,"There, old folks sit alone and grieve and pray for peace to come,"
2305,INDEX,And now our little boy has heard the summons of the drum.
2306,INDEX,
2307,INDEX,"Their grief was such a distant thing, we made it fruit for speech."
2308,INDEX,We never thought in days of old such pain our hearts would reach.

2361,INDEX,There are many to shout for the right;
2362,INDEX,There are many to rail at the world and its sins

2374,INDEX,"And the glorious goal is in view,"
2375,INDEX,"But the many, too often, when dangers appear,"
2376,INDEX,Aren't willing to see the fight through.
2377,INDEX,
2378,INDEX,"They weaken in spirit when trials grow great,"
2379,INDEX,They flinch at the clashing of steel;
2380,INDEX,They talk of the strength of the foe at the gate
2381,INDEX,And whine at the hurts that they feel.
2382,INDEX,"They begin to regret having ventured for right,"
2383,INDEX,"They sigh that they dared to be true,"

2876,INDEX,Stand an' see the beauties of the blue that's in the sky--
2877,INDEX,Then ask of God why mortals haven't any better sense
2878,INDEX,Than to quarrel an' to battle
2879,INDEX,Where the guns an' cannon rattle
2880,INDEX,An' to slaughter one another an' to fill the world with hate.
2881,INDEX,God brings the buds to blossom
2882,INDEX,Where the gentle breezes toss 'em
2883,INDEX,An' the soul is blind to beauty that takes anger for its mate.
2884,INDEX,
2885,INDEX,Listen to the singin' of the robins in the trees!
2886,INDEX,See the sunbeams flashin' where they're mirrored by the stream!
2887,INDEX,"Hear the drowsy buzzin' of the honey-seekin' bees,"
2888,INDEX,Then draw a little closer to your God the while you dream.
2889,INDEX,When the world is dressed to cheer you
2890,INDEX,Don't you feel Him standin' near you?
2891,INDEX,"When your soul drinks in the beauty of the wonders in His plan,"
2892,INDEX,"An' you've put away your passions,"
2893,INDEX,Don't you think the works He fashions
2894,INDEX,In their beauty an' their bigness mock the littleness of man?
2895,INDEX,
2896,INDEX,"Oh, I never walk an orchard nor a field with daisies strewn,"
2897,INDEX,An' I never stand bare-headed gazin' everywhere about
2898,INDEX,"At the living joys around me, be it morning, night or noon,"
2899,INDEX,But I ask God to forgive me that I ever held a doubt.
2900,INDEX,"Surely men must walk in blindness,"
2901,INDEX,"With the whole world tuned to kindness,"
2902,INDEX,An' all dumb an' feathered creatures fairly bubblin' o'er with glee
2903,INDEX,To devote themselves to madness
2904,INDEX,That can only end in sadness
2905,INDEX,An' to think that they are being what God put them here to be.

2909,INDEX,The Chaplain
2910,INDEX,
2911,INDEX,
2912,INDEX,"He was just a small church parson when the war broke out, and he"
2913,INDEX,Looked and dressed and acted like all parsons that we see.
2914,INDEX,"He wore the cleric's broadcloth and he hooked his vest behind,"
2915,INDEX,"But he had a man's religion and he had a strong man's mind,"
2916,INDEX,"And he heard the call to duty, and he quit his church and went,"
2917,INDEX,And he bravely tramped right with 'em everywhere the boys were sent.
2918,INDEX,
2919,INDEX,He put aside his broadcloth and he put the khaki on;
2920,INDEX,Said he'd come to be a soldier and was going to live like one.
2921,INDEX,"Then he refereed the prize fights that the boys pulled off at night,"
2922,INDEX,And if no one else was handy he'd put on the gloves and fight.
2923,INDEX,"He wasn't there a fortnight ere he saw the soldiers' needs,"
2924,INDEX,"And he said: ""I'm done with preaching; this is now the time for deeds."""
2925,INDEX,
2926,INDEX,"He learned the sound of shrapnel, he could tell the size of shell"
2927,INDEX,"From the shriek it make above him, and he knew just where it fell."
2928,INDEX,"In the front line trench he labored, and he knew the feel of mud,"
2929,INDEX,And he didn't run from danger and he wasn't scared of blood.
2930,INDEX,"He wrote letters for the wounded, and he cheered them with his jokes,"
2931,INDEX,And he never made a visit without passing round the smokes.
2932,INDEX,
2933,INDEX,"Then one day a bullet got him, as he knelt beside a lad"
2934,INDEX,"Who was ""going west"" right speedy, and they both seemed mighty glad,"
2935,INDEX,"'Cause he held the boy's hand tighter, and he smiled and whispered low,"
2936,INDEX,"""Now you needn't fear the journey; over there with you I'll go."""
2937,INDEX,"And they both passed out together, arm in arm I think they went."
2938,INDEX,He had kept his vow to follow everywhere the boys were sent.
2939,INDEX,
2940,INDEX,
2941,INDEX,
2942,INDEX,My Part
2943,INDEX,
2944,INDEX,
2945,INDEX,"I may never be a hero, I am past the limit now,"
2946,INDEX,There are pencil marks of silver Time has left upon my brow;
2947,INDEX,"I shall win no service medals, I shall hear no cannons' roar,"
2948,INDEX,"I shall never fight a battle higher up than eagles soar,"
2949,INDEX,But I hope my children's children may recall my name with pride
2950,INDEX,As a man who never whimpered when his soul was being tried.
2951,INDEX,
2952,INDEX,For the fighting and the dying for the everlasting truth
2953,INDEX,"Are the labors designated for the strongest of our youth,"
2954,INDEX,"And the man that's nearing forty isn't asked to march away,"
2955,INDEX,For there is no place in battle for the head that's turning gray.
2956,INDEX,"His test is one of patience till the bitter work is done,"
2957,INDEX,He must back his country's leaders till the victory is won.
2958,INDEX,
2959,INDEX,When this bitter time is ended I don't want to have it said
2960,INDEX,"That I faltered in my courage and I never looked ahead,"
2961,INDEX,"I don't want it told I added to the burdens and the woe,"
2962,INDEX,By preaching dismal doctrines that were cheering to the foe;
2963,INDEX,I want my children's children to respect me and to find
2964,INDEX,"That my soul was out there fighting, though my body stayed behind."
2965,INDEX,
2966,INDEX,When this cruel test is over and the boys come back from France
2967,INDEX,I'd not have them say I hindered for a moment their advance;
2968,INDEX,That they found their duty harder than 'twas needful it should be
2969,INDEX,Because of the complaining of a lot of men like me.
2970,INDEX,"Though I'll win no hero's medals and deserve no wild applause,"
2971,INDEX,"I want to be of service, not a hindrance to the cause."
2972,INDEX,
2973,INDEX,
2974,INDEX,
2975,INDEX,The Call
2976,INDEX,
2977,INDEX,
2978,INDEX,"Some will heed the call to arms,"
2979,INDEX,But all must heed the call to grit;
2980,INDEX,The dreamers on the distant farms
2981,INDEX,Must rally now to do their bit.
2982,INDEX,The whirring lathes in factories great
2983,INDEX,Will sing the martial songs of strife;
2984,INDEX,Upon the emery wheel of fate
2985,INDEX,We're grinding now the nation's life.
2986,INDEX,
2987,INDEX,"The call is not alone to guns,"
2988,INDEX,This is not but a battle test;
2989,INDEX,The world has summoned free men's sons
2990,INDEX,In every field to do their best.
2991,INDEX,The call has come to every man
2992,INDEX,To reach the summit of his powers;
2993,INDEX,To stand to service where he can;
2994,INDEX,A mighty duty now is ours.
2995,INDEX,
2996,INDEX,We must be stalwarts in the field
2997,INDEX,"Where peace has always kept her throne,"
2998,INDEX,"No door against the need is sealed,"
2999,INDEX,No man to-day can live alone.
3000,INDEX,"The young apprentice at the bench,"
3001,INDEX,"The wise inventor, old and gray,"
3002,INDEX,"Serve with the soldier in the trench,"
3003,INDEX,All warriors for the better day.
3004,INDEX,
3005,INDEX,"Oh, man of science, unto you"
3006,INDEX,The call for service now has come!
3007,INDEX,"Mechanic, banker, lawyer, too,"
3008,INDEX,Have you not heard the stirring drum?
3009,INDEX,"Oh, humble digger in the ditch,"
3010,INDEX,"Bend to your spade and do your best,"
3011,INDEX,And prove America is rich
3012,INDEX,In manhood fine for every test.
3013,INDEX,
3014,INDEX,Each man beneath the starry flag
3015,INDEX,Must live his noblest through the strife
3016,INDEX,If tyranny is not to drag
3017,INDEX,Into the mire the best of life.
3018,INDEX,"Though some will wear our uniform,"
3019,INDEX,We face to-day a common fate
3020,INDEX,And all must bravely breast the storm
3021,INDEX,And heed the call for courage great.
3022,INDEX,
3023,INDEX,
3024,INDEX,
3025,INDEX,Thanksgiving
3026,INDEX,
3027,INDEX,
3028,INDEX,"For strength to face the battle's might,"
3029,INDEX,"For men that dare to die for right,"
3030,INDEX,For hearts above the lure of gold
3031,INDEX,"And fortune's soft and pleasant way,"
3032,INDEX,"For courage of our days of old,"
3033,INDEX,"Great God of All, we kneel and pray."
3034,INDEX,
3035,INDEX,We thank Thee for our splendid youth.
3036,INDEX,"Who fight for liberty and truth,"
3037,INDEX,Within whose breasts there glows anew
3038,INDEX,The glory of the altar fires
3039,INDEX,Which our heroic fathers knew--
3040,INDEX,God make them worthy of their sires!
3041,INDEX,
3042,INDEX,We thank Thee for our mothers fair
3043,INDEX,Who through the sorrows they must bear
3044,INDEX,"Still smile, and give their hearts to woe,"
3045,INDEX,Yet bravely heed the day's command--
3046,INDEX,"That mothers, yet to be, may know"
3047,INDEX,A free and glorious motherland.
3048,INDEX,
3049,INDEX,"Oh, God, we thank Thee for the skies"
3050,INDEX,Where our flag now in glory flies!
3051,INDEX,We thank Thee that no love of gain
3052,INDEX,"Is leading us, but that we fight"
3053,INDEX,To keep our banner free from stain
3054,INDEX,And that we die for what is right.
3055,INDEX,
3056,INDEX,"Oh, God, we thank Thee that we may"
3057,INDEX,Lift up our eyes to Thee to-day;
3058,INDEX,We thank Thee we can face this test
3059,INDEX,"With honor and a spotless name,"
3060,INDEX,And that we serve a world distressed
3061,INDEX,Unselfishly and free from shame.
3062,INDEX,
3063,INDEX,
3064,INDEX,
3065,INDEX,A Patriotic Wish
3066,INDEX,
3067,INDEX,
3068,INDEX,I'd like to be the sort of man the flag could boast about;
3069,INDEX,I'd like to be the sort of man it cannot live without;
3070,INDEX,I'd like to be the type of man
3071,INDEX,That really is American:
3072,INDEX,"The head-erect and shoulders-square,"
3073,INDEX,"Clean-minded fellow, just and fair,"
3074,INDEX,That all men picture when they see
3075,INDEX,The glorious banner of the free.
3076,INDEX,
3077,INDEX,"I'd like to be the sort of man the flag now typifies,"
3078,INDEX,The kind of man we really want the flag to symbolize;
3079,INDEX,"The loyal brother to a trust,"
3080,INDEX,"The big, unselfish soul and just,"
3081,INDEX,"The friend of every man oppressed,"
3082,INDEX,The strong support of all that's best--
3083,INDEX,"The sturdy chap the banner's meant,"
3084,INDEX,"Where'er it flies, to represent."
3085,INDEX,
3086,INDEX,"I'd like to be the sort of man the flag's supposed to mean,"
3087,INDEX,"The man that all in fancy see, wherever it is seen;"
3088,INDEX,The chap that's ready for a fight
3089,INDEX,"Whenever there's a wrong to right,"
3090,INDEX,"The friend in every time of need,"
3091,INDEX,"The doer of the daring deed,"
3092,INDEX,The clean and generous handed man
3093,INDEX,That is a real American.
3094,INDEX,
3095,INDEX,
3096,INDEX,
3097,INDEX,A Patriot
3098,INDEX,
3099,INDEX,
3100,INDEX,"It's funny when a feller wants to do his little bit,"
3101,INDEX,"And wants to wear a uniform and lug a soldier's kit,"
3102,INDEX,"And ain't afraid of submarines nor mines that fill the sea,"
3103,INDEX,They will not let him go along to fight for liberty
3104,INDEX,"They make him stay at home and be his mother's darling pet,"
3105,INDEX,But you can bet there'll come a time when they will want me yet.
3106,INDEX,
3107,INDEX,"I want to serve the Stars and Stripes, I want to go and fight,"
3108,INDEX,"I want to lick the Kaiser good, and do the job up right."
3109,INDEX,I know the way to use _a_ gun and I can dig a trench
3110,INDEX,And I would like to go and help the English and the French.
3111,INDEX,"But no, they say, you cannot march away to stirring drums;"
3112,INDEX,Be mother's angel boy at home; stay there and twirl your thumbs.
3113,INDEX,
3114,INDEX,I've read about the daring boys that fight up in the sky;
3115,INDEX,It seems to me that that must be a splendid way to die.
3116,INDEX,I'd like to drive an aeroplane and prove my courage grim
3117,INDEX,"And get above a German there and drop a bomb on him,"
3118,INDEX,But they won't let me go along to help the latest drive;
3119,INDEX,They say my mother needs me here because I'm only five.
3120,INDEX,

3122,INDEX,
3123,INDEX,Memorial Day
3124,INDEX,
3125,INDEX,
3126,INDEX,The finest tribute we can pay
3127,INDEX,"Unto our hero dead to-day,"
3128,INDEX,"Is not a rose wreath, white and red,"
3129,INDEX,In memory of the blood they shed;
3130,INDEX,"It is to stand beside each mound,"
3131,INDEX,"Each couch of consecrated ground,"
3132,INDEX,And pledge ourselves as warriors true
3133,INDEX,Unto the work they died to do.
3134,INDEX,
3135,INDEX,Into God's valleys where they lie
3136,INDEX,"At rest, beneath the open sky,"
3137,INDEX,"Triumphant now, o'er every foe,"
3138,INDEX,As living tributes let us go.
3139,INDEX,No wreath of rose or immortelles
3140,INDEX,Or spoken word or tolling bells
3141,INDEX,"Will do to-day, unless we give"
3142,INDEX,Our pledge that liberty shall live.
3143,INDEX,
3144,INDEX,Our hearts must be the roses red
3145,INDEX,We place above our hero dead;
3146,INDEX,To-day beside their graves we must
3147,INDEX,Renew allegiance to their trust;
3148,INDEX,Must bare our heads and humbly say
3149,INDEX,"We hold the Flag as dear as they,"
3150,INDEX,"And stand, as once they stood, to die"
3151,INDEX,To keep the Stars and Stripes on high.
3152,INDEX,
3153,INDEX,The finest tribute we can pay
3154,INDEX,Unto our hero dead to-day
3155,INDEX,"Is not of speech or roses red,"
3156,INDEX,"But living, throbbing hearts instead"
3157,INDEX,That shall renew the pledge they sealed
3158,INDEX,With death upon the battlefield:
3159,INDEX,That freedom's flag shall bear no stain
3160,INDEX,And free men wear no tyrant's chain.
3161,INDEX,
3162,INDEX,
3163,INDEX,
3164,INDEX,The Soldier on Crutches
3165,INDEX,
3166,INDEX,
3167,INDEX,He came down the stairs on the laughter-filled grill
3168,INDEX,"Where patriots were eating and drinking their fill,"
3169,INDEX,The tap of his crutch on the marble of white
3170,INDEX,Caught my ear as I sat all alone there that night.
3171,INDEX,"I turned--and a soldier my eyes fell upon,"
3172,INDEX,"He had fought for his country, and one leg was gone!"
3173,INDEX,
3174,INDEX,As he entered a silence fell over the place;
3175,INDEX,Every eye in the room was turned up to his face.
3176,INDEX,His head was up high and his eyes seemed aflame
3177,INDEX,"With a wonderful light, and he laughed as he came."
3178,INDEX,He was young--not yet thirty--yet never he made
3179,INDEX,One sign of regret for the price he had paid.
3180,INDEX,
3181,INDEX,One moment before this young soldier came in
3182,INDEX,I had caught bits of speech in the clatter and din
3183,INDEX,From the fine men about me in life's dress parade
3184,INDEX,Who were boasting the cash sacrifices they'd made;
3185,INDEX,"And I'd thought of my own paltry service with pride,"
3186,INDEX,When I turned and that hero of battle I spied.
3187,INDEX,
3188,INDEX,I shall never forget the hot flushes of shame
3189,INDEX,That rushed to my cheeks as that young fellow came.
3190,INDEX,He was cheerful and smiling and clear-eyed and fine
3191,INDEX,And out of his face golden light seemed to shine.
3192,INDEX,And I thought as he passed me on crutches:
3193,INDEX,"""How small"
3194,INDEX,"Are the gifts that I make if I don't give my all."""
3195,INDEX,
3196,INDEX,Some day in the future in many a place
3197,INDEX,More soldiers just like him we'll all have to face.
3198,INDEX,"We must sit with them, talk with them, laugh with them, too,"
3199,INDEX,With the signs of their service forever in view
3200,INDEX,And this was my thought as I looked at him then
3201,INDEX,"--Oh, God! make me worthy to stand with such men."
3202,INDEX,
3203,INDEX,
3204,INDEX,
3205,INDEX,The Friendly Greeting
3206,INDEX,
3207,INDEX,
3208,INDEX,"Oh, we have friends in England, and we have friends in France,"
3209,INDEX,"And should we have to travel there through some strange circumstance,"
3210,INDEX,"Undaunted we should sail away, and gladly should we go,"
3211,INDEX,Because awaiting us would be somebody that we know.
3212,INDEX,
3213,INDEX,"Full many a journey here we make where countless strangers roam,"
3214,INDEX,Yet everywhere our faces turn we find a friend from home.
3215,INDEX,"Oh, we have friends in distant towns, and friends 'neath foreign skies,"
3216,INDEX,And yet we think of him as lost whene'er a loved one dies.
3217,INDEX,
3218,INDEX,"Yet he has merely traveled on, as many a friend must do;"
3219,INDEX,"Within a distant city fair he waits for me and you,"
3220,INDEX,"And when shall come our time to make that journey through the gloam,"
3221,INDEX,"To welcome us he will be there, the smiling friend from home."
3222,INDEX,
3223,INDEX,
3224,INDEX,
3225,INDEX,We Need a Few More Optimists
3226,INDEX,
3227,INDEX,
3228,INDEX,"We need a few more optimists,"
3229,INDEX,The kind that double up their fists
3230,INDEX,"And set their jaws, determined-like,"
3231,INDEX,A blow at infamy to strike.
3232,INDEX,"Not smiling men, who drift along"
3233,INDEX,And compromise with every wrong;
3234,INDEX,Not grinning optimists who cry
3235,INDEX,"That right was never born to die,"
3236,INDEX,But optimists who'll fight to give
3237,INDEX,The truth an honest chance to live.
3238,INDEX,
3239,INDEX,We need a few more optimists
3240,INDEX,"For places in our fighting lists,"
3241,INDEX,The kind of hopeful men who make
3242,INDEX,Real sacrifice for freedom's sake;
3243,INDEX,"The optimist, with purpose strong,"
3244,INDEX,"Who stands to battle every wrong,"
3245,INDEX,"Takes off his coat, and buckles in"
3246,INDEX,The better joys of earth to win!
3247,INDEX,The optimist who worries lest
3248,INDEX,The vile should overthrow the best.
3249,INDEX,
3250,INDEX,"We need a few more optimists,"
3251,INDEX,The brave of heart that long resists
3252,INDEX,The force of Hate and Greed and lust
3253,INDEX,"And keeps in God and man his trust,"
3254,INDEX,"Believing, as he makes his fight"
3255,INDEX,That everything will end all right--
3256,INDEX,Yet through the dreary days and nights
3257,INDEX,"Unfalteringly serves and fights,"
3258,INDEX,And helps to gain the joys which he
3259,INDEX,Believes are some day sure to be.
3260,INDEX,
3261,INDEX,We need a few more optimists
3262,INDEX,Of iron hearts and sturdy wrists;
3263,INDEX,Not optimists who smugly smile
3264,INDEX,And preach that in a little while
3265,INDEX,"The clouds will fade before the sun,"
3266,INDEX,"But cheerful men who'll bear a gun,"
3267,INDEX,"And hopeful men, of courage stout,"
3268,INDEX,Who'll see disaster round about
3269,INDEX,"And yet will keep their faith, and fight,"
3270,INDEX,And gain the victory for right.
3271,INDEX,
3272,INDEX,
3273,INDEX,
3274,INDEX,Taking His Place
3275,INDEX,
3276,INDEX,
3277,INDEX,He's doing double duty now;
3278,INDEX,"Time's silver gleams upon his brow,"
3279,INDEX,And there are lines upon his face
3280,INDEX,Which only passing years can trace.
3281,INDEX,And yet he's turned back many a page
3282,INDEX,"Long written in the book of age,"
3283,INDEX,"For since their boy has marched away,"
3284,INDEX,"This kindly father, growing gray,"
3285,INDEX,Is doing for the mother true
3286,INDEX,The many things the boy would do.
3287,INDEX,
3288,INDEX,Just as the son came home each night
3289,INDEX,"With youthful step and eyes alight,"
3290,INDEX,"So he returns, and with a shout"
3291,INDEX,Of greeting puts her grief to rout.
3292,INDEX,He says that she shall never miss
3293,INDEX,"The pleasure of that evening kiss,"
3294,INDEX,And with strong arms and manner brave
3295,INDEX,"He simulates the hug _he_ gave,"
3296,INDEX,"And loves her, when the day is done,"
3297,INDEX,Both as a husband and a son.
3298,INDEX,
3299,INDEX,His laugh has caught a clearer ring;
3300,INDEX,"His step has claimed the old-time swing,"
3301,INDEX,"And though _his_ absence hurts him, too,"
3302,INDEX,The bravest thing that he can do
3303,INDEX,Is just to try to take _his_ place
3304,INDEX,And keep the smiles on mother's face.
3305,INDEX,"So, merrily he jests at night--"
3306,INDEX,Tells her with all a boy's delight
3307,INDEX,"Of what has happened in the town,"
3308,INDEX,And thus keeps melancholy down.
3309,INDEX,
3310,INDEX,Her letters breathe of hope and cheer;
3311,INDEX,"No note of gloom she sends from here,"
3312,INDEX,And as her husband reads at night
3313,INDEX,"The many messages she writes,"
3314,INDEX,He chuckles o'er the closing line.
3315,INDEX,She's failed his secret to divine--
3316,INDEX,"""When you get home,"" she tells the lad,"
3317,INDEX,"""You'll scarcely know your doting dad;"
3318,INDEX,"Although his hair is turning gray,"
3319,INDEX,"He seems more like a boy each day."""
3320,INDEX,
3321,INDEX,
3322,INDEX,
3323,INDEX,"Christmas, 1918"
3324,INDEX,
3325,INDEX,
3326,INDEX,"They give their all, this Christmastide, that peace on earth shall reign;"
3327,INDEX,"Upon the snows of Flanders now, brave blood has left its stain;"
3328,INDEX,With ribbons red we deck our gifts; theirs bear the red of pain.

3536,INDEX,Then I see a troop in the faded blue

3581,INDEX,
3582,INDEX,They little know the dreams I had

3636,INDEX,"Then a bright-eyed young fellow came in with the meat,"
3637,INDEX,And straightway the troop of us started to eat.
3638,INDEX,
3639,INDEX,I silently noticed that young fellow wait
3640,INDEX,At each officer's side 'til he'd filled up his plate;
3641,INDEX,I was startled a bit at the very first look
3642,INDEX,"By the size of the helping each officer took,"
3643,INDEX,And I thought as I sat there among them that night
3644,INDEX,Of the army's effect on a man's appetite.
3645,INDEX,
3646,INDEX,The waiter at last brought the platter to me
3647,INDEX,And modestly proper I started to be.
3648,INDEX,A small piece of meat then I gracefully took;
3649,INDEX,The young fellow stood there and gave me a look.
3650,INDEX,"""Better get all you want,"" he remarked to me then,"
3651,INDEX,"""I pass this way once, but I don't come again."""
3652,INDEX,
3653,INDEX,I turned in amazement. He nodded his head
3654,INDEX,In a way that convinced me he meant what he said.
3655,INDEX,I knew from his manner and smile on his lip
3656,INDEX,"That the rule in the army is ""no second trip."""

3673,INDEX,
3674,INDEX,"One time we played a baseball game,"
3675,INDEX,"And when a chance for stealing came,"
3676,INDEX,"On second base he stood,"
3677,INDEX,"And when we asked him why, he said:"
3678,INDEX,"""What was the use, they're far ahead,"
3679,INDEX,One run would do no good.
3680,INDEX,"The game is almost over now,"
3681,INDEX,"We couldn't win it anyhow."""

3687,INDEX,"""I'd like to help, but what's the use,"
3688,INDEX,The Allied troops will win it.
3689,INDEX,"There's nothing now to make us fret, there,"
3690,INDEX,"They'll have it won before we get there."""
3691,INDEX,
3692,INDEX,The worst of slackers is the man
3693,INDEX,"Who will not help whene'er he can,"
3694,INDEX,"But plays the idle rover,"
3695,INDEX,And tells to all beset with doubt
3696,INDEX,"There's naught to be alarmed about,"

3709,INDEX,All your grief this Christmas day;
3710,INDEX,May the magic of his splendor
3711,INDEX,Thrill your spirit through and through
3712,INDEX,And may all that's fine and tender
3713,INDEX,Make a smiling day for you.
3714,INDEX,
3715,INDEX,May you never know the sadness
3716,INDEX,That from day to day you dread;
3717,INDEX,May you never find but gladness
3718,INDEX,In the Flag that's overhead;
3719,INDEX,May the good God watch above him
3720,INDEX,"As he stands to duty stern,"
3721,INDEX,And at last to all who love him
3722,INDEX,May he have a safe return.
3723,INDEX,
3724,INDEX,"Little mother, take the blessing"
3725,INDEX,Of a grateful nation's heart;
3726,INDEX,May the news that is distressing
3727,INDEX,Never cause your tears to start;
3728,INDEX,"May there be no fears to haunt you,"
3729,INDEX,And no lonely hours and sad;
3730,INDEX,"May your trials never daunt you,"
3731,INDEX,But may every day be glad.
3732,INDEX,
3733,INDEX,"Little Mother, could I do it,"
3734,INDEX,This my Christmas gift would be:
3735,INDEX,"That he'd safely battle through it,"
3736,INDEX,This to you I'd guarantee.
3737,INDEX,And I'd pledge to you this morning
3738,INDEX,"Joys to banish all your cares,"

3751,INDEX,For Rome grew rich and she turned to song
3752,INDEX,"And danced to music and drank her wine,"
3753,INDEX,But she sapped the strength of her fibres strong
3754,INDEX,And a gilded shroud was her splendor fine.
3755,INDEX,
3756,INDEX,The Rome of old with its wealth and wine
3757,INDEX,Was the handiwork of a sturdy race;
3758,INDEX,They builded well and they made it fine
3759,INDEX,And they dreamed of it as their children's place.
3760,INDEX,"They thought the joys they had won to give,"
3761,INDEX,"And which seemed so certain and fixed and sure,"
3762,INDEX,To the end of time in the world would live
3763,INDEX,And the Rome they'd fashioned would long endure.
3764,INDEX,
3765,INDEX,"They passed to their children the hoarded gold,"
3766,INDEX,Their marble halls and their fertile fields!
3767,INDEX,"But not the spirit of Rome of old,"
3768,INDEX,Nor the Roman courage that never yields.
3769,INDEX,"They left them the wealth that their hands had won,"
3770,INDEX,But they failed to leave them a purpose true.
3771,INDEX,"They left them thinking life's work all done,"
3772,INDEX,And Rome went down and was lost to view.
3773,INDEX,
3774,INDEX,We must guard ourselves lest we follow Rome.
3775,INDEX,We must leave our children the finer things.
3776,INDEX,We must teach them love of the spot called home
3777,INDEX,And the lasting joy that a purpose brings.
3778,INDEX,"For vain are our Flag and our battles won,"
3779,INDEX,"And vain are our lands and our stores of gold,"
3780,INDEX,If our children feel that life's work is done.
3781,INDEX,We must give them a high ideal to hold.

3794,INDEX,Now the heart of me's torn with the grief I

3805,INDEX,"Then the Kaiser flattered and spoke him well,"

3834,INDEX,"We can recount his daily deeds, and backwards we can look,"
3835,INDEX,And proudly live again the time when first a step he took.
3836,INDEX,
3837,INDEX,"I see him trudging off to school, his mother at his side,"
3838,INDEX,And when she left him there alone she hurried home and cried.
3839,INDEX,"And then the sturdy chap of eight that was, I proudly see,"
3840,INDEX,Who packed a little grip and took a fishing trip with me.
3841,INDEX,
3842,INDEX,Among the lists of boys to go his name has now appeared;
3843,INDEX,To us has come the sacrifice that mothers all have feared;
3844,INDEX,"And though we dread the parting hour when he shall march away,"

3857,INDEX,"You have given me riches and ease,"
3858,INDEX,"You have given me joys through the years,"
3859,INDEX,"I have sat in the shade of your trees,"
3860,INDEX,With the song of your birds in my ears.
3861,INDEX,I have drunk of your bountiful wine
3862,INDEX,"And done as I've chosen to do,"
3863,INDEX,"But, oh wonderful country of mine,"
3864,INDEX,'How little have I done for you!
3865,INDEX,
3866,INDEX,"You have given me safe harbor from harm,"
3867,INDEX,Untroubled I've slept through the nights
3868,INDEX,And have waked to the new morning's charm
3869,INDEX,And claimed as my own its delights.
3870,INDEX,I have taken the finest of fine
3871,INDEX,"From your orchards and fields where it grew,"
3872,INDEX,"But, oh wonderful country of mine,"
3873,INDEX,How little I've given to you!
3874,INDEX,
3875,INDEX,You have given me a home and a place
3876,INDEX,Where in safety my babies may play;
3877,INDEX,Health blooms on each bright dimpled face
3878,INDEX,And laughter is theirs every day.
3879,INDEX,You have guarded from danger the shrine

3881,INDEX,"But, oh wonderful country of mine,"
3882,INDEX,How little have I done for you!
3883,INDEX,
3884,INDEX,"I have taken your gifts without thought,"
3885,INDEX,"I have reveled in joys that you gave,"
3886,INDEX,"That I see now with blood had been bought,"

3902,INDEX,"When I no more shall be,"
3903,INDEX,"If of me they would brag,"
3904,INDEX,I'd have them speak of me
3905,INDEX,As one who loved the Flag.

3907,INDEX,God grant my children may
3908,INDEX,Not speak of me as one
3909,INDEX,"Who trod a selfish way,"
3910,INDEX,When I am dead and gone.
3911,INDEX,When they recall my name
3912,INDEX,I'd have them tell that I
3913,INDEX,Held dear my Country's fame
3914,INDEX,And kept her standards high.
3915,INDEX,
3916,INDEX,Not for the things I gave
3917,INDEX,Would I be counted kind;
3918,INDEX,"When I am in my grave,"
3919,INDEX,"If they my worth would find,"
3920,INDEX,I'd have them read it there
3921,INDEX,In red and white and blue

3932,INDEX,If we must merely wander through
3933,INDEX,"Time's garden, idling in the sun;"
3934,INDEX,"If there is nothing big ahead,"
3935,INDEX,Why do we fear to join the dead?
3936,INDEX,
3937,INDEX,Unless to-morrow means that we
3938,INDEX,Shall do some needed service here;
3939,INDEX,That tasks are waiting you and me
3940,INDEX,"That will be lost, save we appear;"
3941,INDEX,Then why this dreadful thought of sorrow
3942,INDEX,That we may never see to-morrow?

3949,INDEX,Though nothing back to life we give?
3950,INDEX,
3951,INDEX,Not to have lived through seventy years
3952,INDEX,Is greatness. Fitter to be sung
3953,INDEX,In poet's praises and in cheers
3954,INDEX,"Is he who dies in action, young;"
3955,INDEX,Who ventures all for one great deed

3963,INDEX,The saddest sort of death to die
3964,INDEX,Would be to quit the game called life
3965,INDEX,"And know, beneath the gentle sky,"
3966,INDEX,You'd lived a slacker in the strife.
3967,INDEX,That nothing men on earth would find
3968,INDEX,To mark the spot that you had filled;
3969,INDEX,That you must go and leave behind
3970,INDEX,No patch of soil your hands had tilled.
3971,INDEX,
3972,INDEX,I know no greater shame than this:
3973,INDEX,To feel that yours were empty years;
3974,INDEX,That after death no man would miss
3975,INDEX,Your presence in this vale of tears;
3976,INDEX,That you had breathed the fragrant air
3977,INDEX,"And sat by kindly fires that burn,"
3978,INDEX,And in earth's riches had a share
3979,INDEX,But gave no labor in return.
3980,INDEX,
3981,INDEX,"Yet some men die this way, nor care:"
3982,INDEX,They enter and they leave life's door
3983,INDEX,"And at the end, their record's bare--"

3985,INDEX,"A few false tears are shed, and then,"
3986,INDEX,"In busy service, they're forgot."
3987,INDEX,We have no time to mourn for men
3988,INDEX,Who lived on earth but served it not.
3989,INDEX,
3990,INDEX,A man in perfect peace to die
3991,INDEX,"Must leave some mark of toil behind,"
3992,INDEX,"Some building towering to the sky,"
3993,INDEX,"Some symbol that his heart was kind,"
3994,INDEX,Some roadway where strange feet may tread
3995,INDEX,That out of gratitude he made;

3997,INDEX,Unless his debt to life is paid.

4005,INDEX,Defeat is the proof of your grit;
4006,INDEX,"A weakling can smile in his days of success,"
4007,INDEX,But at trouble's first sign he will quit.
4008,INDEX,So the test of the heart and the test of your pluck
4009,INDEX,"Isn't skies that are sunny and fair,"
4010,INDEX,But how do you stand to the blow that is struck
4011,INDEX,And how do you battle despair?
4012,INDEX,
4013,INDEX,A fool can seem wise when the pathway is clear
4014,INDEX,"And it's easy to see the way out,"
4015,INDEX,"But the test of man's judgment is something to fear,"
4016,INDEX,And what does he do when in doubt?
4017,INDEX,And the proof of his faith is the courage he shows
4018,INDEX,When sorrows lie deep in his breast;
4019,INDEX,It's the way that he suffers the griefs that he knows
4020,INDEX,That brings out his worst or his best.
4021,INDEX,
4022,INDEX,The test of a man is how much he will bear
4023,INDEX,"For a cause which he knows to be right,"
4024,INDEX,"How long will he stand in the depths of despair,"
4025,INDEX,How much will he suffer and fight?
4026,INDEX,There are many to serve when the victory's near
4027,INDEX,"And few are the hurts to be borne,"
4028,INDEX,But it calls for a leader of courage to cheer
4029,INDEX,The men in a battle forlorn.
4030,INDEX,
4031,INDEX,It's the way you hold out against odds that are great
4032,INDEX,"That proves what your courage is worth,"
4033,INDEX,It's the way that you stand to the bruises of fate
4034,INDEX,That shows up your stature and girth.
4035,INDEX,"And victory's nothing but proof of your skill,"
4036,INDEX,"Veneered with a glory that's thin,"
4037,INDEX,"Unless it is proof of unfaltering will,"
4038,INDEX,And unless you have suffered to win.

4047,INDEX,"He gave me a name that was free from shame,"
4048,INDEX,A name he was proud to bear.
4049,INDEX,"He lived in the morning sunlight,"
4050,INDEX,And marched in the ranks of right.
4051,INDEX,He was always true to the best he knew
4052,INDEX,And the shield that he wore was bright.
4053,INDEX,
4054,INDEX,"I follow a famous father,"
4055,INDEX,And never a day goes by
4056,INDEX,But I feel that he looks down to me
4057,INDEX,To carry his standard high.
4058,INDEX,He stood to the sternest trials
4059,INDEX,As only a brave man can;
4060,INDEX,"Though the way be long, I must never wrong"
4061,INDEX,The name of so good a man.
4062,INDEX,
4063,INDEX,"I follow a famous father,"
4064,INDEX,"Not known to the printed page,"
4065,INDEX,Nor written down in the world's renown
4066,INDEX,As a prince of his little age.
4067,INDEX,But never a stain attached to him
4068,INDEX,And never he stooped to shame;
4069,INDEX,He was bold and brave and to me he gave
4070,INDEX,The pride of an honest name.
4071,INDEX,
4072,INDEX,"I follow a famous father,"
4073,INDEX,And him I must keep in mind;
4074,INDEX,"Though his form is gone, I must carry on"
4075,INDEX,The name that he left behind.
4076,INDEX,"It was mine on the day he gave it,"
4077,INDEX,"It shone as a monarch's crown,"
4078,INDEX,And as fair to see as it came to me
4079,INDEX,It must be when I pass it down.

4089,INDEX,"When he heard his mother calling, he had made her no reply."
4090,INDEX,"""I am playing war,"" he told me, ""and I'm up against defeat,"
4091,INDEX,"And until I stop the Germans I can't take the time to eat."""
4092,INDEX,
4093,INDEX,"""Isn't supper so important that you'll quit your round of play?"
4094,INDEX,"Don't you want to eat the shortcake mother made for you to-day?"""
4095,INDEX,"Then I asked him, but he answered as he shook his little head:"
4096,INDEX,"""I don't dare to stop for shortcake, if I do they'll kill me dead!"
4097,INDEX,"When I drive them from their trenches, then to supper I'll come in,"
4098,INDEX,"But I mustn't stop a minute, 'cause this war I've got to win."""
4099,INDEX,
4100,INDEX,"I left him in his battle, left him there to end his play,"
4101,INDEX,For he'd taught to me a lesson that is needed much to-day;
4102,INDEX,Not the lure of cake could turn him from the work he had to do;
4103,INDEX,There was nothing so important as to see his struggle through.
4104,INDEX,"And I wondered all that evening, as he slumbered in his bed"
4105,INDEX,If we'd risen to the meaning of the work that lies ahead?
4106,INDEX,
4107,INDEX,Are we roused to the importance of the danger in our way?
4108,INDEX,Are we thinking still of pleasures as we thought but yesterday?
4109,INDEX,Are our comforts and our riches in our minds still uppermost?
4110,INDEX,"Must we wait, to see our danger, till the foe is on our coast?"
4111,INDEX,"Oh, there's nothing so important, nothing now that's worth a pin"

4128,INDEX,Through all life's story you will find
4129,INDEX,The miser--with his hoarded gold--

4131,INDEX,An outcast from the human fold.
4132,INDEX,"Men hold him up to view with scorn,"
4133,INDEX,"A creature by his wealth enslaved,"

4141,INDEX,No man was ever truly glad
4142,INDEX,"Who risked his joy on hoarded pelf,"
4143,INDEX,And gave of nothing that he had
4144,INDEX,Through fear of needing it himself.
4145,INDEX,
4146,INDEX,"For selfishness is wintry cold,"
4147,INDEX,"And bitter are its joys at last,"
4148,INDEX,"The very charms it tries to hold,"
4149,INDEX,With woes are quickly overcast.
4150,INDEX,"And only he shall gladly live,"

4164,INDEX,
4165,INDEX,"The roses haven't changed a bit, nor have the peonies stranged a bit,"
4166,INDEX,They bud and bloom the way they did before the war began.
4167,INDEX,"The world is upside down to-day, there's much to make us frown to-day"
4168,INDEX,And gloom and sadness everywhere beset the path of man.
4169,INDEX,
4170,INDEX,But now the lilacs bloom again and give us their perfume again
4171,INDEX,And now the roses smile at us and nod along the way;
4172,INDEX,And it is good to see again the blossoms on each tree again
4173,INDEX,And feel that nature hasn't changed the way we have to-day.
4174,INDEX,
4175,INDEX,"Oh, we have changed from what we were, we're not the carefree lot we were,"
4176,INDEX,"Our hearts are filled with sorrow now and grave concern and pain,"

4195,INDEX,

4201,INDEX,
4202,INDEX,"We shall laugh once more as we used to do, and dance in the old-time way,"
4203,INDEX,For this is the pledge they have made to us who serve in the war to-day;

4205,INDEX,"defend,"
4206,INDEX,And they shall give us our Christmas time as soon as the war shall end.

4218,INDEX,"From the battle's grief and grime,"
4219,INDEX,And shall win our soul's salvation
4220,INDEX,In this bitter trial time.
4221,INDEX,And the old Flag waving o'er us
4222,INDEX,In the dancing morning sun
4223,INDEX,Will be daily singing for us
4224,INDEX,Of a splendor new begun.
4225,INDEX,
