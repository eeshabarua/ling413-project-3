75,PREFACE,
76,PREFACE,These Sketches were made during a year's service as a camion driver with
77,PREFACE,the French amry in the Chemin-des-Dames sector and a year's service with
78,PREFACE,"the A.E.F. as an infantry private on special duty with ""The Stars and"
79,PREFACE,"Stripes,"" the official A.E.F. newspaper. Most of them were drawn at odd"
80,PREFACE,"minutes during the French push of 1917 near Fort Malmaison, at loading"
81,PREFACE,"parks and along the roadside while on truck convoy, and while on special"
82,PREFACE,permission to draw and paint with the French army given me by the Grand
83,PREFACE,Quartier Gènèral during the time I was stationed at Soissons. The rest
84,PREFACE,were drawn on American fronts from the Argonne to Belgium as my duties
85,PREFACE,took me from one offensive to another.
86,PREFACE,
87,PREFACE,It has been a keen regret to me that my artistic skill has been so
88,PREFACE,unequal to these opportunites.  The sketches do not sufficiently show
89,PREFACE,war for the stupid horror I know it to be.
90,PREFACE,
91,PREFACE,"I hope, however, they may serve as a record of doughboy types, of the"
92,PREFACE,"people he lived with in France, with whom he suffered and by whose side"
93,PREFACE,he fought.
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,"Many appeared first in ""The Stars and Stripes,"" ""Leslie's Weekly"", and"
96,PREFACE,"""Scribner's Magazine"", through the courtesy of whose editors I am now"
97,PREFACE,enabled to reprint them.

150,THE LINE,"I have soaked and slid and slipped,"
151,THE LINE,"While my tacky slicker dripped,"
152,THE LINE,And I wondered what they'd hand me out to eat.
153,THE LINE,
154,THE LINE,Get in line!
155,THE LINE,"For supplies and for inspections,"
156,THE LINE,"With the dust in four directions,"

158,THE LINE,"In the winter with my shirt off,"

164,THE LINE,While the sun burned off my map
165,THE LINE,And I waited for some gold-fish (and a cramp!).
166,THE LINE,
167,THE LINE,Get in line!
168,THE LINE,"For rice, pay-day, pills, and ration,"
169,THE LINE,"For corned-willy, army fashion,"

173,THE LINE,
174,THE LINE,"I've been standing, freezing, sweating,"
175,THE LINE,"Pushing, shoving, wheezing, fretting,"
176,THE LINE,And I won't be soon forgetting
