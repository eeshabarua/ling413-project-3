1576,(TO MY CITY),"Hung like a blight on town and tower and tree,"
1577,(TO MY CITY),Hardly was Beauty anywhere to see
1578,(TO MY CITY),Save--how fine rain (together
1579,(TO MY CITY),With spare last leaves of creepers once showed wet
1580,(TO MY CITY),"As it were, with blood of some high-making passion,)"
1581,(TO MY CITY),Drifted slow and slow....
1582,(TO MY CITY),But steadily aglow
1583,(TO MY CITY),"The City was, beneath its grey, and set"
1584,(TO MY CITY),Strong-mooded above the day’s inclemency.
1585,(TO MY CITY),
1586,(TO MY CITY),"Flaunting from houses, over the rejoicing crowd,"
1587,(TO MY CITY),Flags waved; that told how nation against nation
1588,(TO MY CITY),"Should war no more, their wounds tending awhile:--"
1589,(TO MY CITY),The sullen vanquished; Victors with heads bowed.

1591,(TO MY CITY),"The whole time cried Victory, Victory flew"
1592,(TO MY CITY),Banners invisible argent; Music intangible
1593,(TO MY CITY),A glory of spirit wandered the wide air through.
1594,(TO MY CITY),"All knew it, nothing mean of fire or common"
1595,(TO MY CITY),Ran in men’s minds; none so poor but knew
1596,(TO MY CITY),"Some touch of sacred wonder, noble wonder,--"
1597,(TO MY CITY),Thought’s surface moving under;
1598,(TO MY CITY),Life’s texture coarse transfiguring through and through.

1607,(TO MY CITY),Yet one discerned
1608,(TO MY CITY),"A new spirit learnt of pain, some great"
1609,(TO MY CITY),Acceptance out of hard endurance learned
1610,(TO MY CITY),And truly; wrested bare of hand from Fate.
1611,(TO MY CITY),"The soldier from his body slips the pack,"
1612,(TO MY CITY),"Staggers, relaxes, crouches, then lies back,"
1613,(TO MY CITY),Glad for the end of torment. Here was more.

1617,(TO MY CITY),"Humbly accepted,--a proud and grateful nation"
1618,(TO MY CITY),"Took the reward of purpose had not swerved,"
1619,(TO MY CITY),But steadily before
1620,(TO MY CITY),"Saw out, with equal mind, through alternation"
1621,(TO MY CITY),Of hope and doubt--a four-year purge of fire
1622,(TO MY CITY),Changing with sore
1623,(TO MY CITY),"Travail the flawed spirit, cleansing desire."
1624,(TO MY CITY),
1625,(TO MY CITY),And glad was I:
1626,(TO MY CITY),Glad--who had seen
1627,(TO MY CITY),By Somme and Ancre too many comrades lie.
1628,(TO MY CITY),It was as if the Woman’s spirit moved
1629,(TO MY CITY),"That multitude, never of Man that pays"
1630,(TO MY CITY),So lightly for the treasure of his days--
1631,(TO MY CITY),Of some woman that too greatly had beloved
1632,(TO MY CITY),"Yet, willing, half her care of life foregone;"

1640,(TO MY CITY),Forlorn colours showed; rags glory-bare.

1646,(TO MY CITY),Of those who gave their frames of flesh to cover
1647,(TO MY CITY),"From spoil their land and folk, desperately fashioned"
1648,(TO MY CITY),Fate stubborn to their will.

1650,(TO MY CITY),"Rain fell, miserably, miserably, and still"
