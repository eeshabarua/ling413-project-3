607,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"When Peace regains her throne and reigns, and silent are the guns,"
608,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,I'll think with pride of those who died and say They were my Sons.
609,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,
610,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"I sent them from their peaceful tasks, those strong young sons of mine;"
611,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"I saw them swinging down the street, I saw them stand in line."
612,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"My unbronzed of the counting-house, my sun-tanned from the farms,"
613,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"I sent them forth, sons of the North, my gallant men-at-arms."
614,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,
615,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"With summer's fading rose they went, I well recall the day;"
616,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"The gold was on the maple leaf, the birds were on the spray,"

618,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,For word to tell me how they served their country and their King.
619,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,
620,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,And then I heard the tolling bells and saw the flags half-mast.
621,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"Why should I weep in springtime with the long, white winter past?"
622,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,And why are all the people stirred and what is it they say?

639,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,
640,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,They watched the fume-filled cloud-bank rise and spread its

642,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,They saw the Belgian veterans and gallant French fall back;
643,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"They heard them cry, they saw them fly as men by fiends pursued;"

649,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"Surprised, amazed, a moment dazed, in that tremendous hour,"
650,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,Like living rocks they met the shocks of mad Germanic power.
651,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,
652,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"They saw the wide breach wider grow, when men in terror fled;"
653,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,They saw the eager foe leap on o'er the dying and the dead;
654,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,And by that foe and through that gap they saw an Empire fall;
655,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"Then, in the breach, to front the foe, they threw their living wall."
656,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,
657,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"They threw their living breasts between to stem the German tide,"
658,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,My volunteers of Canada--they fought as vet'rans tried.
659,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"They fought the boast of Wilhelm's host; they met them hand to hand,"
660,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"My young men of the counting-house, my ploughboys from the land."
661,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,
662,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"They came from ranches of the West, where plain and mountain call,"
663,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"From down east way, by Fundy's Bay, from Don and Montreal;"
664,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"Their feet had known the sea-walled street, where ocean"
665,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"mists hang gray,"
666,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"And one to four, though stricken sore, they kept the foe at bay."
667,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,
668,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"The air rained death by bomb and dart, the earth belched death below"
669,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,By shining blade and hand grenade and death by poison slow.
670,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"Three days of hell, with shot and shell, they fought"
671,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,'neath moon and sun;
672,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,"The Belgian plain was strewn with slain, Canadian and Hun."
673,THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK,

966,GRIT AND TORY,I'll tell for you the story.
967,GRIT AND TORY,

969,GRIT AND TORY,"Before the Call of Duty came and took us o'er the sea,"

992,GRIT AND TORY,"Went o'er the ocean wide and blue,"
993,GRIT AND TORY,Convoyed by fighting cruisers;
994,GRIT AND TORY,And as we sailed for sunny France
995,GRIT AND TORY,I wondered which would get his chance
996,GRIT AND TORY,And which would be the loser.

998,GRIT AND TORY,"When whole battalions march away and enter in the fray,"

1006,GRIT AND TORY,Among the wounded lying.
1007,GRIT AND TORY,
1008,GRIT AND TORY,"Strange tricks that jade of fortune plays upon the field of strife,"
1009,GRIT AND TORY,And so it came in war's great game I owed to Bill my life.
1010,GRIT AND TORY,We didn't meet till on the Somme--
1011,GRIT AND TORY,"In No-Man's Land I lay most gone,"
1012,GRIT AND TORY,"While over head the bright sun shone,"
1013,GRIT AND TORY,And shrapnel shells were flying.
1014,GRIT AND TORY,Then suddenly I felt a thrill.
1015,GRIT AND TORY,I heard the voice of fighting Bill
1016,GRIT AND TORY,For his old foeman calling.
1017,GRIT AND TORY,
1018,GRIT AND TORY,I did my best to cry hello; it was too great a strain;
1019,GRIT AND TORY,But in a haze I saw his face and heard him call again.
1020,GRIT AND TORY,I knew him by the broken nose
1021,GRIT AND TORY,I gave him once when we'd had blows
1022,GRIT AND TORY,"At one of our big country shows,"
1023,GRIT AND TORY,"When I gave him a mauling,"
1024,GRIT AND TORY,And then he spied me and cried--Joe!
1025,GRIT AND TORY,"I raised to greet him kind of slow,"
1026,GRIT AND TORY,And then he caught me falling.
1027,GRIT AND TORY,
1028,GRIT AND TORY,"Such things as this don't happen much, but they do happen though,"
1029,GRIT AND TORY,And he's a different Bill to-day and I'm a different Joe.
1030,GRIT AND TORY,We're back again in that same town.
1031,GRIT AND TORY,"He up the street where I live down,"
