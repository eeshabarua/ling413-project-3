115,MY BUNKIE,
116,MY BUNKIE,"He's mostly gnarls and freckles and tan,"
117,MY BUNKIE,"He'd surely come under society's ban,"
118,MY BUNKIE,"He's a swearin', fightin' cavalryman,"
119,MY BUNKIE,But--he's my bunkie.
120,MY BUNKIE,
121,MY BUNKIE,He's weathered the winds of the Western waste.
122,MY BUNKIE,"(You, gentle Christian, would call him debased)"
123,MY BUNKIE,"And he's loved at his ease and married in haste,"
124,MY BUNKIE,Has my bunkie.
125,MY BUNKIE,
126,MY BUNKIE,"In a Philippine paddy he's slept in the rain,"
127,MY BUNKIE,"When he's drunk rotten booze that drives you insane,"
128,MY BUNKIE,"And he's often court-martialed--yes, over again,"
129,MY BUNKIE,Is my bunkie.
130,MY BUNKIE,
131,MY BUNKIE,"He's been on the booze the whole blooming night,"
132,MY BUNKIE,"To mount guard next morning most awfully tight,"
133,MY BUNKIE,"Though he's ""dressed"" like a soldier when given ""Guide Right,"""
134,MY BUNKIE,He's my bunkie.
135,MY BUNKIE,
136,MY BUNKIE,"He doesn't know Browning or Ibsen or Keats,"
137,MY BUNKIE,But he knows mighty well when the other man cheats
138,MY BUNKIE,"And he licks him and makes him the laugh of the streets,"
139,MY BUNKIE,Does my bunkie.
140,MY BUNKIE,
141,MY BUNKIE,"He stands by and cheers when I'm having fun,"
142,MY BUNKIE,"And when it is over says, ""Pretty well done,"""
143,MY BUNKIE,"But he takes a large hand if they rush two to one,"
144,MY BUNKIE,For--he's my bunkie.
145,MY BUNKIE,
146,MY BUNKIE,"When Taps has blown and all the troop is asleep,"
147,MY BUNKIE,"We nudge each other and gingerly creep,"
148,MY BUNKIE,"To where the shadows hang heavy and deep,"
149,MY BUNKIE,I and my bunkie.
150,MY BUNKIE,
151,MY BUNKIE,"And then when the fire-flies flittering roam,"
152,MY BUNKIE,"We sit close together out there in the gloam,"
153,MY BUNKIE,"And talk about things appertaining to home,"
154,MY BUNKIE,I and my bunkie.
155,MY BUNKIE,
156,MY BUNKIE,"If the slow tropic fever is a-shaking my spine,"
157,MY BUNKIE,"And they blow ""boots and saddles"" to chase the brown swine,"
158,MY BUNKIE,"He'll give me a leg-up and ride me in line,"
159,MY BUNKIE,Will my bunkie.
160,MY BUNKIE,
161,MY BUNKIE,"And if I get hit--his arm goes around,"
162,MY BUNKIE,"And raises me tenderly off of the ground,"
163,MY BUNKIE,"And the words on his lips are a comforting sound,"
164,MY BUNKIE,The words of my bunkie.

179,OUR OFFICERS,"I've seen them, sir, in battle"
180,OUR OFFICERS,"With the bullets flyin' round,"
181,OUR OFFICERS,I've seen them lying wounded
182,OUR OFFICERS,With the blood-stains on the ground.
183,OUR OFFICERS,I've watched them when the fever
184,OUR OFFICERS,"Was a-ragin' in the camp,"
185,OUR OFFICERS,I've seen them nurse the cholera--
186,OUR OFFICERS,A-wrestling with the cramp.
187,OUR OFFICERS,
188,OUR OFFICERS,I've seen them pin to that ol' flag
189,OUR OFFICERS,"Another glory more,"
190,OUR OFFICERS,That made the stripes look brighter
191,OUR OFFICERS,Than they ever did before.
192,OUR OFFICERS,"They weren't winning V.C.'s, either,"
193,OUR OFFICERS,But because the country said
194,OUR OFFICERS,"For them to go, they went."
195,OUR OFFICERS,They done it or they're dead.

202,OUR OFFICERS,"You can't go too fast an' far,"
203,OUR OFFICERS,You're officers and gentlemen
204,OUR OFFICERS,Like Congress says you are.
205,OUR OFFICERS,
206,OUR OFFICERS,"I wish I could re-up, sir,"
207,OUR OFFICERS,"Till you get your silver stars,"
208,OUR OFFICERS,"I'm sure you'll do them credit, sir,"
209,OUR OFFICERS,As you have done the bars.
210,OUR OFFICERS,"I know I shouldn't talk so much,"
211,OUR OFFICERS,"But somehow I'm inclined,"
212,OUR OFFICERS,On leavin' the old outfit
213,OUR OFFICERS,Just to speak the company's mind.

240,PAY DAY,And all begin to cheer.
241,PAY DAY,The games will soon be goin'
242,PAY DAY,Snap your fingers at the dice;

244,PAY DAY,'Til the Barkeep's out of ice.
245,PAY DAY,
246,PAY DAY,"For it's pay-day, pay-day, pay-day;"

271,THE ARMY GROUCH,"And tho' he's slept ten hours or more,"
272,THE ARMY GROUCH,"His back is weak, his feet are sore,"
273,THE ARMY GROUCH,And he can hardly stand.

281,THE ARMY GROUCH,They organized this bloomin' war;
282,THE ARMY GROUCH,"These flapjacks taste like wood."""
283,THE ARMY GROUCH,"And so he growls through all the day,"
284,THE ARMY GROUCH,And fills his comrades with dismay;
285,THE ARMY GROUCH,They'd kill him if they could.
286,THE ARMY GROUCH,"When ""First Call"" wakes up Billy Lott,"
287,THE ARMY GROUCH,"He sits upon his Army cot,"
288,THE ARMY GROUCH,"And whistles ""Casey Jones,"""
289,THE ARMY GROUCH,"And as he jumps into his shoes,"
290,THE ARMY GROUCH,"He says, ""By Jinks I've had a snooze"
291,THE ARMY GROUCH,"That's good for skin and bones."""
292,THE ARMY GROUCH,And Billy always has a smile
293,THE ARMY GROUCH,"That you can see for half a mile,"
294,THE ARMY GROUCH,"And when he stops to say, 'How Do!'"
295,THE ARMY GROUCH,He chases dimples to your cheeks

634,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),(A ONE-DAY HIKE)
635,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
636,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Rise and Shine, the bugle's calling!"
637,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Spring up lively from your beds!
638,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Into line we'll soon be falling--
639,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Shake a leg, you sleepy heads!"
640,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
641,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Better make a hasty toilet,"
642,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Like the other fellows do,"
643,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"For I'll guarantee you'll spoil it,"
644,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Long before the day is thru!
645,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
646,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Better see the shoes you're wearing
647,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Have a heavy pair of soles;
648,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Or you'll do some awful swearing
649,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),When the rocks come thru the holes!
650,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
651,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Have your canteen filled and ready
652,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Haversack swung on your belt,"
653,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Where it will swing good and steady
654,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),And its weight is scarcely felt!
655,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
656,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),At your breakfast don't you hurry--
657,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Eat another dish of beans;
658,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),For you'll need it--don't you worry--
659,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Hiking in the Philippines!
660,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
661,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Up the dusty road we've started--
662,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Rout Step--walking at our ease;
663,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Soon the even lines are parted--
664,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),All are walking as they please.
665,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
666,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Long before the sun has ambled
667,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"O'er the green hills on our right,"
668,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Far along the road we've rambled
669,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),In the early morning light.
670,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
671,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Thru the narrow trail we're walking,"
672,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Sticking to the narrow path.
673,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Just behind us some are talking,"
674,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),'Way ahead we hear a laugh.
675,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
676,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Now a slender bridge we're crossing,"
677,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Over to a ""goo-goo"" farm--"
678,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Where a Carabao is tossing
679,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Up his head, in great alarm."
680,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
681,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Here we stop to rest a trifle--
682,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Sip a drop from our canteens.
683,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Gee! It's tough to ""pack"" a rifle--"
684,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Hiking in the Philippines.
685,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
686,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),'Round the narrow path we're turning;
687,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Tho it's early morning, yet."
688,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Down the sun is fiercely burning--
689,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Bringing out the drops of sweat!
690,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
691,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Where the tropic trees are shading
692,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Out the sunlight overhead
693,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Leggings, shoes and all, we're wading"
694,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Thru a shallow river-bed.
695,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
696,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),You can hear the bamboo cracking
697,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Underneath our heavy tread,"
698,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),While the forest trails we're tackling--
699,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Following, where we are lead."
700,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
701,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),You have got to be a Hiker
702,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"To keep up with these Marines,"
703,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Not a big four-flush or piker--
704,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Hiking in the Philippines!
705,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
706,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Where the big mangoes are growing,"
707,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"We have halted--Stacking Arms,"
708,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Far away, a rooster's crowing"
709,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),On one of the native farms.
710,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
711,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Under branches of big palm trees,"
712,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),We are resting easy now--
713,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Welcoming the cooling sea breeze
714,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),While we're waiting for our Chow.
715,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
716,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Plainest fare is a fiesta
717,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),When you've Hiked for half a day;
718,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),And a little noon siesta
719,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Helps to pass the time away!
720,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),
721,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Like a ribbon all unraveled
722,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),"Starts the line at half past two,"
723,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),There are new trails to be traveled
724,(A ONE-DAY HIKE),Back to old Olongapo!
