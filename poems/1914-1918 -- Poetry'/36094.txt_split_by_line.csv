93,"ALAN L. STRANG,",

97,"ALAN L. STRANG,",For us to do or die.
98,"ALAN L. STRANG,","Our country needed fighting men,"
99,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Her liberty to save;
100,"ALAN L. STRANG,","These boys responded to the call,"
101,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And all they had they gave.
102,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
103,"ALAN L. STRANG,","All loyal hearts are beating fast,"

105,"ALAN L. STRANG,",For liberty shall reign supreme
106,"ALAN L. STRANG,","O'er ocean, dale and hill."
107,"ALAN L. STRANG,",With no regrets for parted hopes

121,"ALAN L. STRANG,","He said, ""I'm Daddy's soldier boy,"""
122,"ALAN L. STRANG,",When he was five years old;
123,"ALAN L. STRANG,","And then went out and built snow forts,"
124,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Although the day was cold.
125,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
126,"ALAN L. STRANG,","The snowballs were his hand grenades,"
127,"ALAN L. STRANG,",A stick his bayonette;
128,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And with a home-made wooden gun
129,"ALAN L. STRANG,",The foe he bravely met.
130,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
131,"ALAN L. STRANG,","In five more years he joined the ""scouts"""
132,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And hiked across the hills;
133,"ALAN L. STRANG,","He learned to wear a khaki suit,"
134,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And do military drills.
135,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
136,"ALAN L. STRANG,","And so the years passed swiftly on,"
137,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And now he is a man;
138,"ALAN L. STRANG,","He's in the trenches over there,"
139,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Fighting for Uncle Sam.

141,"ALAN L. STRANG,",I know he'll make the Huns regret

152,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
153,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
154,"ALAN L. STRANG,",I want to be a soldier
155,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And march away to France;
156,"ALAN L. STRANG,","I want to find a wicked ""Hun,"""
157,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And shoot him in the pants.
158,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
159,"ALAN L. STRANG,","I want to be a soldier,"

178,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
179,"ALAN L. STRANG,",But now the only way for me

187,"ALAN L. STRANG,",The Storm
188,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
189,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
190,"ALAN L. STRANG,",The rough old Mr. Storm
191,"ALAN L. STRANG,","Is whirling, swirling past"
192,"ALAN L. STRANG,",He makes the treetops bow their heads
193,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And trembles at his blast.
194,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
195,"ALAN L. STRANG,",He never stops to think
196,"ALAN L. STRANG,","Of the damage he may do,"
197,"ALAN L. STRANG,",He's always rushing in and out
198,"ALAN L. STRANG,","And hitting, batting you."
199,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
200,"ALAN L. STRANG,","He pushes big, black clouds"
201,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Against the mountain tops;
202,"ALAN L. STRANG,",The rain and hail comes rushing down
203,"ALAN L. STRANG,","In large, round crystal drops."
204,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
205,"ALAN L. STRANG,",The storm will soon be over;
206,"ALAN L. STRANG,",See the rainbow in the sky.
207,"ALAN L. STRANG,","The birds will sing on airy wing,"

215,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
216,"ALAN L. STRANG,","Do not worry over trifles, though"
217,"ALAN L. STRANG,","to you they may seem great,"
218,"ALAN L. STRANG,","All your fretting will not help you,"
219,"ALAN L. STRANG,",or your troubles dissipate.
220,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
221,"ALAN L. STRANG,","If your sky is dark and gloomy,"
222,"ALAN L. STRANG,","and the sun is hid from view,"
223,"ALAN L. STRANG,","Bravely smile and keep on smiling,"
224,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And your friends will smile with you.
225,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
226,"ALAN L. STRANG,","Happiness is so contagious, and a"
227,"ALAN L. STRANG,",smile is never lost;
228,"ALAN L. STRANG,","Then why worry over trifles, tho"
229,"ALAN L. STRANG,",your heart seems tempest tossed.
230,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
231,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Therefore go on life's journey

239,"ALAN L. STRANG,",How can we Fool the Rooster?
240,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
241,"ALAN L. STRANG,","Written when the clock was set ahead one hour on April 1, 1918."
242,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
243,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
244,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Our Rooster wakes at half-past five
245,"ALAN L. STRANG,","And crows with all his might,"
246,"ALAN L. STRANG,",He tries to wake the people up
247,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Before the day is light.
248,"ALAN L. STRANG,",When Daddy hears the rooster crow
249,"ALAN L. STRANG,",He knows he should awake
250,"ALAN L. STRANG,","And light the kitchen fire, so Ma"
251,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Can cook the Johnny cake.
252,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
253,"ALAN L. STRANG,","Now, maybe we can fool my Dad"
254,"ALAN L. STRANG,","That it's half-past five when it's half-past four,"
255,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And maybe the system's the best we have had
256,"ALAN L. STRANG,",To fool some thousands of people or more;
257,"ALAN L. STRANG,","But, how can we fool that rooster?"
258,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
259,"ALAN L. STRANG,",I have always thought our rooster had
260,"ALAN L. STRANG,","A clock inside of his head,"
261,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And I don't know how we can fix it so
262,"ALAN L. STRANG,",We can set the clock ahead.
263,"ALAN L. STRANG,","I asked my Dad, and he said to me,"
264,"ALAN L. STRANG,","""Why, son, you surely know"
265,"ALAN L. STRANG,",A rooster's instinct wakens him
266,"ALAN L. STRANG,","And tells him when to crow."""
267,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
268,"ALAN L. STRANG,","Now the hands of the clock we can turn ahead,"
269,"ALAN L. STRANG,",We can fool the people and feel content;
270,"ALAN L. STRANG,","But the thing that worries me night and day,"
271,"ALAN L. STRANG,",And on which my entire thought is bent
272,"ALAN L. STRANG,","Is, how can we fool that rooster?"

280,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
281,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
282,"ALAN L. STRANG,",I wove me a wreath of flowers
283,"ALAN L. STRANG,","To place in memories hall,"
284,"ALAN L. STRANG,",In honor of the brave and fearless men
285,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Who had answered our country's call.
286,"ALAN L. STRANG,","The men who had answered, and fought, and died"
287,"ALAN L. STRANG,","For the cause of freedom, our country's pride!"
288,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
289,"ALAN L. STRANG,",I wove me a wreath of flowers
290,"ALAN L. STRANG,","With many a sigh and tear,"
291,"ALAN L. STRANG,",As a tribute to all the good and true
292,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Who were given few honors here.
293,"ALAN L. STRANG,",The man of humble piety
294,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Who lived and died in obscurity.
295,"ALAN L. STRANG,",
296,"ALAN L. STRANG,","A wreath of flowers, a little thing"
297,"ALAN L. STRANG,",For flowers wither and fade;
298,"ALAN L. STRANG,",But the fragrance they shed is not soon forgot
299,"ALAN L. STRANG,","By me, who the wreath has made."
300,"ALAN L. STRANG,","So the virtues of those who have gone before,"
301,"ALAN L. STRANG,",Will always be treasured in memory's store.

488,A NEW YEAR WISH,The days soon became filled with interesting things for Masata. One day
489,A NEW YEAR WISH,"when he was roaming through the wilds, he heard a wild buffalo"
490,A NEW YEAR WISH,"approaching. He seemed almost helpless, as he had nothing but a small"
491,A NEW YEAR WISH,"bow and a few arrows, and the buffalo was only a short distance from"
492,A NEW YEAR WISH,"him. He began to run in what he thought was the direction of his home,"
493,A NEW YEAR WISH,but instead he was going in the opposite way. In a few minutes he saw
494,A NEW YEAR WISH,the smoke of a camp fire and ran toward it. By this time the beast was
495,A NEW YEAR WISH,"very close to him and he was almost in despair, when the buffalo lurched"
496,A NEW YEAR WISH,"forward, then rolled over dead. Three Indians hunting near by had hit"
497,A NEW YEAR WISH,him in a vital spot with an arrow.
498,A NEW YEAR WISH,
499,A NEW YEAR WISH,The Indians belonged to a tribe which was his father's most bitter
500,A NEW YEAR WISH,"enemy, and they took him before their chief. The chief ordered that he"
501,A NEW YEAR WISH,"be let live for two moons, and he was given a bed of dry twigs to sleep"
502,A NEW YEAR WISH,on as the night was drawing near.
503,A NEW YEAR WISH,
504,A NEW YEAR WISH,Time passed quietly for Masata until the approach of the morning of the
505,A NEW YEAR WISH,second moon. He had been planning how he would escape from his father's
506,A NEW YEAR WISH,enemies. Finally one morning he slipped into a bear skin and hopped
507,A NEW YEAR WISH,"bravely off toward the woods. The Indians thinking he was a bear, shot"
508,A NEW YEAR WISH,"arrows at him and wounded him in the right arm, but Masata kept"
509,A NEW YEAR WISH,bravely on and was soon out of range of the arrows. Then he bandaged his
510,A NEW YEAR WISH,wounded arm the best he could and set out for his father's wigwam.
511,A NEW YEAR WISH,
512,A NEW YEAR WISH,"He arrived safely the same evening, and his parents were overjoyed to"
513,A NEW YEAR WISH,"see him and know he was safe once more, and the tribe made a great"
514,A NEW YEAR WISH,"feast, or as they call it, Pow Wow, as a welcome to his home coming."
515,A NEW YEAR WISH,
516,A NEW YEAR WISH,"While Masata was still a young ""brave"" their chief died and after a"
517,A NEW YEAR WISH,"great ceremony, Masata was made Chief of the tribes, and was known as"
518,A NEW YEAR WISH,great and good ruler.
