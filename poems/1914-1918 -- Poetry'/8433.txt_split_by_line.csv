85,THE VAGABOND,
86,THE VAGABOND,It was deadly cold in Danbury town
87,THE VAGABOND,"One terrible night in mid November,"
88,THE VAGABOND,A night that the Danbury folk remember
89,THE VAGABOND,"For the sleety wind that hammered them down,"
90,THE VAGABOND,"That chilled their faces and chapped their skin,"
91,THE VAGABOND,"And froze their fingers and bit their feet,"
92,THE VAGABOND,"And made them ice to the heart within,"
93,THE VAGABOND,And spattered and scattered
94,THE VAGABOND,And shattered and battered
95,THE VAGABOND,Their shivering bodies about the street;
96,THE VAGABOND,And the fact is most of them didn't roam
97,THE VAGABOND,"In the face of the storm, but stayed at home;"
98,THE VAGABOND,"While here and there a policeman, stamping"
99,THE VAGABOND,To keep himself warm or sedately tramping
100,THE VAGABOND,"Hither and thither, paced his beat;"
101,THE VAGABOND,Or peered where out of the blizzard's welter
102,THE VAGABOND,"Some wretched being had crept to shelter,"
103,THE VAGABOND,"And now, drenched through by the sleet, a muddled"
104,THE VAGABOND,"Blur of a man and his rags, lay huddled."
105,THE VAGABOND,
106,THE VAGABOND,"But one there was who didn't care,"
107,THE VAGABOND,"Whatever the furious storm might dare,"
108,THE VAGABOND,"A wonderful, hook-nosed bright-eyed fellow"
109,THE VAGABOND,In a thin brown cape and a cap of yellow
110,THE VAGABOND,That perched on his dripping coal-black hair.
111,THE VAGABOND,"A red scarf set off his throat and bound him,"
112,THE VAGABOND,"Crossing his breast, and, winding round him,"
113,THE VAGABOND,Flapped at his flank
114,THE VAGABOND,In a red streak dank;
115,THE VAGABOND,"And his hose were red, with a purple sheen"
116,THE VAGABOND,"From his tunic's blue, and his shoes were green."
117,THE VAGABOND,He was most outlandishly patched together
118,THE VAGABOND,"With ribbons of silk and tags of leather,"
119,THE VAGABOND,"And chains of silver and buttons of stone,"
120,THE VAGABOND,"And knobs of amber and polished bone,"
121,THE VAGABOND,"And a turquoise brooch and a collar of jade,"
122,THE VAGABOND,"And a belt and a pouch of rich brocade,"
123,THE VAGABOND,And a gleaming dagger with inlaid blade
124,THE VAGABOND,And jewelled handle of burnished gold
125,THE VAGABOND,Rakishly stuck in the red scarf's fold--
126,THE VAGABOND,"A dress, in short, that might suit a wizard"
127,THE VAGABOND,On a calm warm day
128,THE VAGABOND,"In the month of May,"
129,THE VAGABOND,But was hardly fit for an autumn blizzard.
130,THE VAGABOND,
131,THE VAGABOND,"Whence had he come there? Who could say,"
132,THE VAGABOND,"As he swung through Danbury town that day,"
133,THE VAGABOND,"With a friendly light in his deep-set eyes,"
134,THE VAGABOND,"And his free wild gait and his upright bearing,"
135,THE VAGABOND,"And his air that nothing could well surprise,"
136,THE VAGABOND,So bright it was and so bold and daring?
137,THE VAGABOND,He might have troubled the slothful ease
138,THE VAGABOND,Of the Great Mogul in a warlike fever;
139,THE VAGABOND,"He might have bled for the Maccabees,"
140,THE VAGABOND,"Or risen, spurred"
141,THE VAGABOND,"By the Prophet's word,"
142,THE VAGABOND,And swooped on the hosts of the unbeliever.
143,THE VAGABOND,
144,THE VAGABOND,"Whatever his birth and his nomenclature,"
145,THE VAGABOND,"Something he seemed to have, some knowledge"
146,THE VAGABOND,"That never was taught at school or college,"
147,THE VAGABOND,But was part of his very being's nature:
148,THE VAGABOND,Some ingrained lore that wanderers show
149,THE VAGABOND,"As over the earth they come and go,"
150,THE VAGABOND,Though they hardly know what it is they know.
151,THE VAGABOND,
152,THE VAGABOND,"And so with his head upheld he walked,"
153,THE VAGABOND,And ever the rain drove down;
154,THE VAGABOND,And now and again to himself he talked
155,THE VAGABOND,In the streets of Danbury town.
156,THE VAGABOND,And now and again he'd stop and troll
157,THE VAGABOND,A stave of music that seemed to roll
158,THE VAGABOND,From the inmost depths of his ardent soul;
159,THE VAGABOND,But the wind took hold of the notes and tossed them
160,THE VAGABOND,And the few who chanced to be near him lost them.
161,THE VAGABOND,
162,THE VAGABOND,"So, moving on where his fancy listed,"
163,THE VAGABOND,He came to a street that turned and twisted;
164,THE VAGABOND,And there by a shop-front dimly lighted
165,THE VAGABOND,"He suddenly stopped as though affrighted,"
166,THE VAGABOND,Stopped and stared with his deep gaze centred
167,THE VAGABOND,"On something seen, like a dream's illusion,"
168,THE VAGABOND,"Through the streaming glass, mid the queer confusion"
169,THE VAGABOND,"Of objects littered on shelf and floor,"
170,THE VAGABOND,And about the counter and by the door--
171,THE VAGABOND,And then with his lips set tight he entered.
172,THE VAGABOND,
173,THE VAGABOND,"There were rusty daggers and battered breastplates,"
174,THE VAGABOND,"And jugs of pewter and carved oak cases,"
175,THE VAGABOND,"And china monsters with hideous faces,"
176,THE VAGABOND,And cracked old plates that had once been best plates;
177,THE VAGABOND,And needle-covers and such old-wivery;
178,THE VAGABOND,Wonderful chess-men made from ivory;
179,THE VAGABOND,"Cut-glass bottles for wines and brandies,"
180,THE VAGABOND,Sticks once flourished by bucks and dandies;
181,THE VAGABOND,"Deep old glasses they drank enough in,"
182,THE VAGABOND,And golden boxes they took their snuff in;
183,THE VAGABOND,"Rings that flashed on a gallant's knuckles,"
184,THE VAGABOND,Seals and lockets and shining buckles;
185,THE VAGABOND,"Watches sadly in need of menders,"
186,THE VAGABOND,Blackened firedogs and dinted fenders;
187,THE VAGABOND,"Prints and pictures and quaint knick-knackery,"
188,THE VAGABOND,Rare old silver and mere gimcrackery--
189,THE VAGABOND,"Such was the shop, and in its middle"
190,THE VAGABOND,Stood an old man holding a dusty fiddle.
191,THE VAGABOND,
192,THE VAGABOND,"The Vagabond bowed and the old man bowed,"
193,THE VAGABOND,And then the Vagabond spoke aloud.
194,THE VAGABOND,"""Sir,"" he said, ""we are two of a trade,"
195,THE VAGABOND,"Each for the other planned and made,"
196,THE VAGABOND,"And so we shall come to a fair agreement,"
197,THE VAGABOND,Since I am for you and you're for me meant.
198,THE VAGABOND,"And I, having travelled hither from far, gain"
199,THE VAGABOND,You yourself as my life's best bargain.
200,THE VAGABOND,But I am one
201,THE VAGABOND,"Who chaffers for fun,"
202,THE VAGABOND,Who when he perceives such stores of beauty
203,THE VAGABOND,Outspread conceives it to be his duty
204,THE VAGABOND,To buy of his visit a slight memento:
205,THE VAGABOND,"Some curious gem of the quattrocento,"
206,THE VAGABOND,"Or something equally rare and priceless,"
207,THE VAGABOND,Though its outward fashions perhaps entice less:
208,THE VAGABOND,"A Sultan's slipper, a Bishop's mitre,"
209,THE VAGABOND,"Or the helmet owned by a Roundhead fighter,"
210,THE VAGABOND,"Or an old buff coat by the years worn thin,"
211,THE VAGABOND,Or--what do you say to the violin?
212,THE VAGABOND,"I'll wager you've many, so you can't miss one,"
213,THE VAGABOND,"And I--well, I have a mind for this one,"
214,THE VAGABOND,"This which was made, as you must know,"
215,THE VAGABOND,Three hundred years and a year ago
216,THE VAGABOND,By one who dwelt in Cremona city
217,THE VAGABOND,"For me--but I lost it, more's the pity,"
218,THE VAGABOND,Sixty years back in a wild disorder
219,THE VAGABOND,That flamed to a fight on the Afghan border;
220,THE VAGABOND,"And, whatever it costs, I am bound to win it,"
221,THE VAGABOND,"For I left the half of my full soul in it."""
222,THE VAGABOND,
223,THE VAGABOND,And now as he spoke his eyes began
224,THE VAGABOND,To shiver the heart of the grey old man;
225,THE VAGABOND,"And the old man stuttered,"
226,THE VAGABOND,"And ""Sir,"" he muttered,"
227,THE VAGABOND,"""The words you speak are the merest riddle,"
228,THE VAGABOND,"But-five pounds down, and you own the fiddle!"
229,THE VAGABOND,"And I'll choose for your hand, while the pounds you dole out,"
230,THE VAGABOND,"A bow with which you may pick that soul out."""
231,THE VAGABOND,
232,THE VAGABOND,"So said so done, and our friend again"
233,THE VAGABOND,Was out in the raging wind and rain.
234,THE VAGABOND,Swift through the twisting street he passed
235,THE VAGABOND,"And came to the Market Square at last,"
236,THE VAGABOND,And climbed and stood
237,THE VAGABOND,On a block of wood
238,THE VAGABOND,"Where a pent-house, leant to a wall, gave shelter"
239,THE VAGABOND,"From the brunt of the blizzard's helter-skelter,"
240,THE VAGABOND,"And, waving his bow, he cried, ""Ahoy!"
241,THE VAGABOND,"Now steady your hearts for an hour of joy!"""
242,THE VAGABOND,And so to his cheek and jutting chin
243,THE VAGABOND,"Straight he fitted the violin,"
244,THE VAGABOND,"And, rounding his arm in a movement gay,"
245,THE VAGABOND,Touched the strings and began to play.
246,THE VAGABOND,
247,THE VAGABOND,There hasn't been heard since the world spun round
248,THE VAGABOND,Such a marvellous blend of thrilling sound.
249,THE VAGABOND,"It streamed, it flamed, it rippled and blazed,"
250,THE VAGABOND,"And now it reproached and now it praised,"
251,THE VAGABOND,And the liquid notes of it wove a scheme
252,THE VAGABOND,That was one-half life and one-half a dream.
253,THE VAGABOND,And again it scaled in a rush of fire
254,THE VAGABOND,The glittering peaks of high desire;
255,THE VAGABOND,"Now, foiled and shattered, it rose again"
256,THE VAGABOND,And plucked at the souls and hearts of men;
257,THE VAGABOND,And still as it rose the sleet came down
258,THE VAGABOND,In the Market Square of Danbury town.
259,THE VAGABOND,
260,THE VAGABOND,"And now from hundreds of opened doors,"
261,THE VAGABOND,With quiet paces
262,THE VAGABOND,"And happy faces,"
263,THE VAGABOND,"In ones and twos and threes and fours,"
264,THE VAGABOND,A crowd pressed out to the Market Square
265,THE VAGABOND,And stood in the storm and listened there.
266,THE VAGABOND,
267,THE VAGABOND,"And, oh, with what a solemn tender strain"
268,THE VAGABOND,The long-drawn music eased their hearts of pain;
269,THE VAGABOND,And gave them visions of divine content;
270,THE VAGABOND,"Green fields and happy valleys far away,"
271,THE VAGABOND,And rippling streams and sunshine and the scent
272,THE VAGABOND,Of bursting buds and flowers that come in May.
273,THE VAGABOND,"And one spoke in a rapt and gentle voice,"
274,THE VAGABOND,"And bade his friends rejoice,"
275,THE VAGABOND,"""For now,"" he said, ""I see, I see once more"
276,THE VAGABOND,My little lass upon a pleasant shore
277,THE VAGABOND,"Standing, as long ago she used to stand,"
278,THE VAGABOND,And beckoning to me with her dimpled hand.
279,THE VAGABOND,"As in the vanished years,"
280,THE VAGABOND,"So I behold her and forget my tears."""
281,THE VAGABOND,"And each one had his private joy, his own,"
282,THE VAGABOND,"All the old happy things he once had known,"
283,THE VAGABOND,"Renewed and from the prisoning past set free,"
284,THE VAGABOND,And mixed with hope and happy things to be.
285,THE VAGABOND,
286,THE VAGABOND,"So for a magic hour the music gushed,"
287,THE VAGABOND,"Then faded to a close, and all was hushed,"
288,THE VAGABOND,"And the tranced people woke and looked about,"
289,THE VAGABOND,And fell to wondering what had brought them out
290,THE VAGABOND,"On such a night of wind and piercing sleet,"
291,THE VAGABOND,Exposed with hatless heads and thin-shod feet.
292,THE VAGABOND,"Something, they knew, had chased their heavy sadness;"
293,THE VAGABOND,"And for the years to come they still may keep,"
294,THE VAGABOND,"As from a morning sleep,"
295,THE VAGABOND,Some broken gleam of half-remembered gladness.
296,THE VAGABOND,But the wild fiddler on his feet of flame
297,THE VAGABOND,Vanished and went the secret way he came.

303,SINGING WATER,
304,SINGING WATER,"I heard--'twas on a morning, but when it was and where,"
305,SINGING WATER,"Except that well I heard it, I neither know nor care--"
306,SINGING WATER,"I heard, and, oh, the sunlight was shining in the blue,"
307,SINGING WATER,A little water singing as little waters do.
308,SINGING WATER,
309,SINGING WATER,"At Lechlade and at Buscot, where Summer days are long,"
310,SINGING WATER,The tiny rills and ripples they tremble into song;
311,SINGING WATER,"And where the silver Windrush brings down her liquid gems,"
312,SINGING WATER,There's music in the wavelets she tosses to the Thames.
313,SINGING WATER,
314,SINGING WATER,"The eddies have an air too, and brave it is and blithe;"
315,SINGING WATER,I think I may have heard it that day at Bablockhythe;
316,SINGING WATER,And where the Eynsham weir-fall breaks out in rainbow spray
317,SINGING WATER,The Evenlode comes singing to join the pretty play.
318,SINGING WATER,
319,SINGING WATER,But where I heard that music I cannot rightly tell;
320,SINGING WATER,"I only know I heard it, and that I know full well:"
321,SINGING WATER,"I heard a little water, and, oh, the sky was blue,"
322,SINGING WATER,A little water singing as little waters do.

328,(AGED FIVE YEARS),(AGED FIVE YEARS)
329,(AGED FIVE YEARS),
330,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Like winds that with the setting of the sun
331,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Draw to a quiet murmuring and cease,"
332,(AGED FIVE YEARS),So is her little struggle fought and done;
333,(AGED FIVE YEARS),And the brief fever and the pain
334,(AGED FIVE YEARS),In a last sigh fade out and so release
335,(AGED FIVE YEARS),The lately-breathing dust they may not hurt again.
336,(AGED FIVE YEARS),
337,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Now all that Wilma was is made as naught:
338,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Stilled is the laughter that was erst our pleasure;
339,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"The pretty air, the childish grace untaught,"
340,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"The innocent wiles,"
341,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"And all the sunny smiles,"
342,(AGED FIVE YEARS),The cheek that flushed to greet some tiny treasure;
343,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"The mouth demure, the tilted chin held high,"
344,(AGED FIVE YEARS),The gleeful flashes of her glancing eye;
345,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Her shy bold look of wildness unconfined,"
346,(AGED FIVE YEARS),And the gay impulse of her baby mind
347,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"That none could tame,"
348,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"That sent her spinning round,"
349,(AGED FIVE YEARS),A spirit of living flame
350,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Dancing in airy rapture o'er the ground--
351,(AGED FIVE YEARS),All these with that faint sigh are made to be
352,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Man's breath upon a glass, a mortal memory."
353,(AGED FIVE YEARS),
354,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Then from the silent room where late she played,"
355,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Setting a steady course toward the light,"
356,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Swifter than thistledown the little shade,"
357,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Reft from the nooks that she had made her own
358,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"And from the love that sheltered, fared alone"
359,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Forth through the gloomy spaces of the night,"
360,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Until at last she lit before the gate
361,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Where all the suppliant shades must stand and wait.
362,(AGED FIVE YEARS),
363,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Grim Cerberus, the foiler of the dead,"
364,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Keeping his everlasting vigil there
365,(AGED FIVE YEARS),In deep-mouthed wrath
366,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Athwart the rocky path,"
367,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Did at her coming raise his triple head
368,(AGED FIVE YEARS),And lift his bristling hair;
369,(AGED FIVE YEARS),But when he saw our tender little maid
370,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Forlorn, but unafraid,"
371,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"He blinked his flaming eyes and ceased to frown,"
372,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"And, fawning on her, smoothed his shaggy crest,"
373,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Composed his savage limbs and settled down
374,(AGED FIVE YEARS),With ears laid back and all his care at rest;
375,(AGED FIVE YEARS),And so with kindly aspect beckoned in
376,(AGED FIVE YEARS),The little playmate of his earthly kin.
377,(AGED FIVE YEARS),
378,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"For often she had tugged old Rollo's mane,"
379,(AGED FIVE YEARS),And often Lufra felt the loving check
380,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Of childish arms about her glossy neck--
381,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Lufra and Rollo, who with anxious faces"
382,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Now cast about the haunts and hiding-places
383,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"To find their friend, but ever cast in vain."
384,(AGED FIVE YEARS),
385,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"So now, set free from all that can oppress,"
386,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"And in her own white innocence arrayed,"
387,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Made one for ever with all happiness,"
388,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Alert she wanders through the starry glade;
389,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Or, where the blissful Shades intone their praise,"
390,(AGED FIVE YEARS),She from the lily-covered bowers
391,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Heaping her arms with flowers
392,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Soars and is borne along
393,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"The amaranthine the delightful ways,"
394,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Gushes the pretty notes and careless trills
395,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Of her unstudied song,"
396,(AGED FIVE YEARS),And with her music all the joyous valley fills.
397,(AGED FIVE YEARS),
398,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Yet, oh ye Powers whose rule is set above"
399,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"These fair abodes that ring the firmament,"
400,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Spirits of Peace and Happiness and Love,"
401,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"And thou, too, mild-eyed Spirit of Content,"
402,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Ye will not chide if sometimes in her play
403,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"The child should start and droop her shining head,"
404,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Turning in meek surmise
405,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Her wistful eyes
406,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Back tow'rd the dimness of our mortal day
407,(AGED FIVE YEARS),And the loved home from which her soul was sped.
408,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Soon shall our little Wilma learn to be
409,(AGED FIVE YEARS),Amid the immortal blest
410,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"An unrepining guest,"
411,(AGED FIVE YEARS),"Who now, dear heart, is young for your eternity."

420,I,There's nothing I know of to make you spend
421,I,A day of your life at Cragwell End.
422,I,"It's a village quiet and grey and old,"
423,I,A little village tucked into a fold
424,I,"(A sort of valley, not over wide)"
425,I,Of the hills that flank it on either side.
426,I,"There's a large grey church with a square stone tower,"
427,I,And a clock to mark you the passing hour
428,I,In a chime that shivers the village calm
429,I,With a few odd bits of the 100th psalm.
430,I,"A red-brick Vicarage stands thereby,"
431,I,"Breathing comfort and lapped in ease,"
432,I,"With a row of elms thick-trunked and high,"
433,I,And a bevy of rooks to caw in these.
434,I,
435,I,'Tis there that the Revd. Salvyn Bent
436,I,(No tie could be neater or whiter than _his_ tie)
437,I,"Maintains the struggle against dissent,"
438,I,An Oxford scholar _ex Aede Christi_;
439,I,And there in his twenty-minute sermons
440,I,"He makes mince-meat of the modern Germans,"
441,I,Defying their _apparatus criticus_
442,I,"Like a brave old Vicar,"
443,I,A famous sticker
444,I,"To Genesis, Exodus and Leviticus."
445,I,He enjoys himself like a hearty boy
446,I,Who finds his life for his needs the aptest;
447,I,But the poisoned drop in his cup of joy
448,I,"Is the Revd. Joshua Fall, the Baptist,"
449,I,An earnest man with a tongue that stings--
450,I,The Vicar calls him a child of schism--
451,I,Who has dared to utter some dreadful things
452,I,"On the vices of sacerdotalism,"
453,I,And the ruination
454,I,Of education
455,I,By the Church of England Catechism.
456,I,
457,I,"Set in a circle of oak and beech,"
458,I,North of the village lies Cragwell Hall;
459,I,"And stretching far as the eye can reach,"
460,I,Over the slopes and beyond the fall
461,I,Of the hills so keeping their guard about it
462,I,"That the north wind never may chill or flout it,"
463,I,"Through forests as dense as that of Arden,"
464,I,"With orchard and park and trim-kept garden,"
465,I,"And farms for pasture and farms for tillage,"
466,I,The Hall maintains its rule of the village.
467,I,And in the Hall
468,I,"Lived the lord of all,"
469,I,Girt round with all that our hearts desire
470,I,"Of leisure and wealth, the ancient Squire."
471,I,He was the purplest-faced old man
472,I,"Since ever the Darville race began,"
473,I,Pompous and purple-faced and proud;
474,I,With a portly girth and a voice so loud
475,I,You might have heard it a mile away
476,I,When he cheered the hounds on a hunting day.
477,I,"He was hard on dissenters and such encroachers,"
478,I,He was hard on sinners and hard on poachers;
479,I,He talked of his rights as one who knew
480,I,That the pick of the earth to him was due:
481,I,"The right to this and the right to that,"
482,I,To the humble look and the lifted hat;
483,I,"The right to scold or evict a peasant,"
484,I,The right to partridge and hare and pheasant;
485,I,The right to encourage discontent
486,I,By raising a hard-worked farmer's rent;
487,I,The manifest right to ride to hounds
488,I,Through his own or anyone else's grounds;
489,I,The right to eat of the best by day
490,I,And to snore the whole of the night away;
491,I,"For his motto, as often he explained,"
492,I,"Was ""A Darville holds what a Darville gained."""
493,I,"He tried to be just, but that may be"
494,I,Small merit in one who has most things free;
495,I,"And his neighbours averred,"
496,I,"When they heard the word,"
497,I,"""Old Darville's a just man, is he? Bust his"
498,I,"Gills, we could do without his justice!"""
499,I,

501,II,
502,II,"The village itself runs, more or less,"
503,II,"On the sinuous line of a letter S,"
504,II,Twining its little houses through
505,II,"The twists of the street, as our hamlets do,"
506,II,"For no good reason, so far as I know,"
507,II,Save that chance has arranged it so.
508,II,"It's a quaint old ramshackle moss-grown place,"
509,II,Keeping its staid accustomed pace;
510,II,"Not moved at all by the rush and flurry,"
511,II,The mad tempestuous windy hurry
512,II,"Of the big world tossing in rage and riot,"
513,II,While the village holds to its old-world quiet.
514,II,
515,II,"There's a family grocer, a family baker,"
516,II,A family butcher and sausage-maker--
517,II,"A butcher, proud of his craft and willing"
518,II,"To admit that his business in life is killing,"
519,II,Who parades a heart as soft as his meat's tough--
520,II,There's a little shop for the sale of sweet stuff;
521,II,There's a maker and mender of boots and shoes
522,II,"Of the sort that the country people use,"
523,II,"Studded with iron and clamped with steel,"
524,II,"And stout as a ship from toe to heel,"
525,II,Who announces himself above his entry
526,II,"As ""patronised by the leading gentry."""
527,II,"There's an inn, ""The George"";"
528,II,"There's a blacksmith's forge,"
529,II,And in the neat little inn's trim garden
530,II,"The old men, each with his own churchwarden,"
531,II,"Bent and grey, but gossipy fellows,"
532,II,"Sip their innocent pints of beer,"
533,II,While the anvil-notes ring high and clear
534,II,To the rushing bass of the mighty bellows.
535,II,And thence they look on a cheerful scene
536,II,"As the little ones play on the Village Green,"
537,II,Skipping about
538,II,With laugh and shout
539,II,"As if no Darville could ever squire them,"
540,II,And nothing on earth could tame or tire them.
541,II,
542,II,On the central point of the pleasant Green
543,II,The famous stone-walled well is seen
544,II,Which has never stinted its ice-cold waters
545,II,To generations of Cragwell's daughters.
546,II,No matter how long the rain might fail
547,II,There was always enough for can and pail--
548,II,Enough for them and enough to lend
549,II,To the dried-out rivals of Cragwell End.
550,II,An army might have been sent to raise
551,II,Enough for a thousand washing days
552,II,"Crowded and crammed together in one day,"
553,II,"One vast soap-sudded and wash-tubbed Monday,"
554,II,"And, however fast they might wind the winch,"
555,II,The water wouldn't have sunk an inch.
556,II,"For the legend runs that Crag the Saint,"
557,II,"At the high noon-tide of a summer's day,"
558,II,"Thirsty, spent with his toil and faint,"
559,II,"To the site of the well once made his way,"
560,II,And there he saw a delightful rill
561,II,"And sat beside it and drank his fill,"
562,II,"Drank of the rill and found it good,"
563,II,"Sitting at ease on a block of wood,"
564,II,"And blessed the place, and thenceforth never"
565,II,The waters have ceased but they run for ever.
566,II,"They burnt St. Crag, so the stories say,"
567,II,"And his ashes cast on the winds away,"
568,II,"But the well survives, and the block of wood"
569,II,"Stands--nay, stood where it always stood,"
570,II,And still was the village's pride and glory
571,II,On the day of which I shall tell my story.
572,II,"Gnarled and knotty and weather-stained,"
573,II,"Battered and cracked, it still remained;"
574,II,"And thither came,"
575,II,"Footsore and lame,"
576,II,On an autumn evening a year ago
577,II,"The wandering pedlar, Gipsy Joe."
578,II,Beside the block he stood and set
579,II,His table out on the well-stones wet.
580,II,"""Who'll buy? Who'll buy?"" was the call he cried"
581,II,As the folk came flocking from every side;
582,II,"For they knew their Gipsy Joe of old,"
583,II,His free wild words and his laughter bold:
584,II,So high and low all gathered together
585,II,"By the village well in the autumn weather,"
586,II,Lured by the gipsy's bargain-chatter
587,II,And the reckless lilt of his hare-brained patter.
588,II,"And there the Revd. Salvyn Bent,"
589,II,"The parish church's ornament,"
590,II,"Stood, as it chanced, in discontent,"
591,II,And eyed with a look that was almost sinister
592,II,"The Revd. Joshua Fall, the minister."
593,II,"And the Squire, it happened, was riding by,"
594,II,"With an angry look in his bloodshot eye,"
595,II,"Growling, as was his wont, and grunting"
596,II,At the wasted toil of a bad day's hunting;
597,II,And he stopped his horse on its homeward way
598,II,To hear what the gipsy had to say.
599,II,
600,III,III
601,III,
602,III,"Then the pedlar called to the crowd to hear,"
603,III,And his voice rang loud and his voice rang clear;
604,III,And he lifted his head and began to troll
605,III,The whimsical words of his rigmarole:--
606,III,
607,III,"""_Since last I talked to you here I've hurled"
608,III,"My lone way over the wide, wide world."
609,III,South and North and West and East
610,III,I've fought with man and I've fought with beast_;
611,III,_And I've opened the gates and cleared the bar
612,III,That blocks the road to the morning star!_
613,III,
614,III,"""_I've seen King Pharaoh sitting down"
615,III,"On his golden throne in his jewelled crown,"
616,III,With wizards fanning like anything
617,III,To cool the face of the mighty King:
618,III,"But the King said, 'Wizards are off,' said he;"
619,III,'Let Joseph the gipsy talk to me.'_
620,III,
621,III,"""_So I sat by the King and began to spout"
622,III,As the day drew in and the sun went out;
623,III,And I sat by the King and spun my tale
624,III,Till the light returned and the night grew pale;
625,III,And none of the Wizards blinked or stirred
626,III,While the King sat drinking it word by word._
627,III,
628,III,"""_Then he gave me rubies and diamonds old;"
629,III,He gave me masses of minted gold.
630,III,He gave me all that a King can give:
631,III,The right to live and to cease to live
632,III,"Whenever--and that'll be soon, I know--"
633,III,The days are numbered of Gipsy Joe._
634,III,
635,III,"""_Then I went and I wandered on and on"
636,III,Till I came to the kingdom of Prester John;
637,III,And there I stood on a crystal stool
638,III,And sang the song of 'The First Wise Fool':
639,III,"Oh, I sang it low and I sang it high"
640,III,Till John he whimpered and piped his eye._
641,III,
642,III,"""_Then I drew a tooth from the lively jaw"
643,III,Of the Prester's ebony Aunt-in-law;
644,III,"And he bubbled and laughed so long, d'you see,"
645,III,That his wife looked glum and I had to flee.
646,III,"So I fled to the place where the Rajahs grow,"
647,III,A place where they wanted Gipsy Joe._
648,III,
649,III,"""_The Rajahs summoned the turbaned hordes"
650,III,And gave me sheaves of their inlaid swords;
651,III,"And the Shah of Persia next I saw,"
652,III,Who's brother and friend to the Big Bashaw;
653,III,And he sent me a rope of turquoise stones
654,III,The size of a giant's knuckle-bones._
655,III,
656,III,"""_But a little brown Pygmie took my hand"
657,III,"And rattled me fast to a silver strand,"
658,III,Where the little brown Pygmie boys and girls
659,III,Are cradled and rocked to sleep in pearls._
660,III,"_And the Pygmies flattered me soft and low,"
661,III,"'You are tall; be King of us, Gipsy Joe.'_"
662,III,
663,III,"""_I governed them well for half-a-year,"
664,III,"But it came to an end, and now I'm here."
665,III,"Oh, I've opened the gates and cleared the bar,"
666,III,"And I've come, I've come to my friends from far."
667,III,"I'm old and broken, I'm lame and tired,"
668,III,But I've come to the friends my soul desired._
669,III,
670,III,"""_So it's watches and lockets, and who will buy?"
671,III,"It's ribbon and lace, and they're not priced high."
672,III,If you're out for a ring or a golden chain
673,III,You can't look over my tray in vain:
674,III,And here is a balsam made of drops
675,III,From a tree that's grown by the AEthiops!_
676,III,
677,III,"""_I've a chip of the tooth of a mastodont"
678,III,That's sure to give you the girl you want.
679,III,I've a packet of spells to make men sigh
680,III,For the lustrous glance of your liquid eye--
681,III,"But it's much too dark for such wondrous wares,"
682,III,"So back, stand back, while I light my flares!_"""
683,III,
684,III,"Then he lit a match, but his fingers fumbled,"
685,III,"And, striking his foot on a stone, he stumbled;"
686,III,"And the match, released by the sudden shock,"
687,III,"Fell in flame on the old wood-block,"
688,III,And burnt there very quietly--
689,III,"But before you could have counted three,"
690,III,"Hardly giving you time to shout,"
691,III,"A red-blue column of fire shot out,"
692,III,"Up and up and ever higher,"
693,III,"A marvellous burst of raging fire,"
694,III,"Lighting the crowd that shrank from its flashes,"
695,III,"And so decreasing,"
696,III,And suddenly ceasing
697,III,As the seat of St. Crag was burnt to ashes!
698,III,
699,III,But in the smoke that drifted on the Green
700,III,Queer freaks of vision weirdly wrought were seen:
701,III,For on that shifting background each one saw
702,III,His own reflection and recoiled in awe;
703,III,"Saw himself there, a bright light shining through him,"
704,III,"Not as he thought himself, but as men knew him."
705,III,Before this sudden and revealing sense
706,III,"Each rag of sham, each tatter of pretence"
707,III,"Withered and vanished, as dissolved in air,"
708,III,And left the shuddering human creature bare.
709,III,But when they turned and looked upon a friend
710,III,They saw a sight that all but made amend:
711,III,For they beheld him as a radiant spirit
712,III,"Indued with virtue and surpassing merit,"
713,III,"Not vain or dull or mean or keen for pelf,"
714,III,But splendid--as he mostly saw himself.
715,III,"Darville and Fall were drawn to one another,"
716,III,And both to Bent as to their heart's own brother;
717,III,"And a strange feeling grew in every breast,"
718,III,A self-defeating altruistic zest
719,III,"Which from that moment's flash composed their strife,"
720,III,Informed their nature and controlled their life.
721,III,"But when they sought the Gipsy, him they found,"
722,III,"His dark eyes staring, dead upon the ground."

732,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"And, most, to melancholy."
733,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"He cocked his head, he made no sound,"
734,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"But gave me stare for stare back,"
735,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"When, having fluttered round and round,"
736,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,He perched upon a chair-back.
737,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,
738,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"I rose; ah, then, it seemed, he knew"
739,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,Too late his reckless error:
740,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"Away in eager haste he flew,"
741,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,And at his tail flew terror.
742,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"Now here, now there, from wall to floor,"
743,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"For mere escape appealing,"
744,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,He fled and struck against the door
745,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,Or bumped about the ceiling.
746,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,
747,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"I went and flung each window wide,"
748,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,I drew each half-raised blind up;
749,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,To coax him out in vain I tried;
750,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,He could not make his mind up.
751,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"He flew, he fell, he took a rest,"
752,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,And off again he scuffled
753,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,With parted beak and panting breast
754,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,And every feather ruffled.
755,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,
756,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"At length I lured him to the sill,"
757,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,All dazed and undivining;
758,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"Beyond was peace o'er vale and hill,"
759,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,And all the air was shining.
760,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,I stretched my hand and touched him; then
761,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"He made no more resistance,"
762,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,But left the cramped abode of men
763,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,And flew into the distance.
764,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,
765,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,*       *       *      *       *
766,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,
767,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,Is life like that? We make it so;
768,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"We leave the sunny spaces,"
769,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"And beat about, or high or low,"
770,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,In dark and narrow places;
771,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"Till, worn with failure, vexed with doubt,"
772,THE BIRD IN THE ROOM,"Our strength at last we rally,"

791,KILLED IN ACTION,But always baulked of meeting them at last.
792,KILLED IN ACTION,He could not brook--and always so declared--
793,KILLED IN ACTION,"The weak pomposities of little men,"
794,KILLED IN ACTION,"Scorned all the tin-gods of our petty world,"

803,KILLED IN ACTION,
804,KILLED IN ACTION,"When the great summons came he rushed to arms,"

934,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",And a burst of rollicking high-pitched laughter
935,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",The stealthy trickling waves that lap you
936,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",And the crested breakers that tumble after

954,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",With dancing mischief in his eye.
955,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","His body gleams against the light,"
956,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",A clear-cut shape of dazzling white
957,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Set off and topped by golden hair
958,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",That streams and tosses in the air.
959,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","A moment poised, he dares the leap"
960,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",And cuts the wind and cleaves the deep.
961,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Down through the emerald vaults self-hurled

963,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Another moment sees him rise

969,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Still up he soars and high and high
970,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",A speck of light that dots the sky.
971,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Then watch him as he slowly droops
972,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Where the great sea-birds wheel their troops.
973,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","Three broad-winged gulls, himself their lord,"
974,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","He hitches to a silken cord,"
975,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Bits them and bridles them with skill
976,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",And bids them draw him where he will.
977,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Above the tumult of the shores
978,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","He floats, he stoops, he darts, he soars;"
979,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",From near and far he calls the rest
980,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",And waves them forward for a quest;
981,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","Then straight, without a check, he speeds"
982,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Across the azure tracts and leads
983,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",With apt reproof and cheering words
984,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",As on a chase his cry of birds.

986,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",And when he has finished his airy fun

990,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",He will cover with flints its frowning face
991,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","To keep the tide in its proper place,"
992,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",And the waves shall employ their utmost damp art
993,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",In vain to abolish your moated rampart.
994,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","And nobody's nurse shall make a fuss,"
995,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",As is far too often the case with us;
996,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Instead of the usual how-de-do
997,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",She will give us praise when we get wet through;
998,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",In fact she will smile and think it better
999,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",When we get as wet as we like and wetter.
1000,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","As for eating too much, you can safely risk it"
1001,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","With chocolate, lollipop, cake, and biscuit,"
1002,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",And your mother will revel with high delight
1003,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",In the state of her own one's appetite.
1004,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Great shells there shall be of a rainbow hue
1005,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",To be found and gathered by me and you;
1006,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",Wonderful nets for the joy of making 'em.
1007,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",And scores of shrimps for the trouble of taking 'em;
1008,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",In fact it isn't half bad--now is it?--
1009,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",When Robin the Sea-boy pays his visit.
1010,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",And perhaps he will tire of his shape and habit
1011,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","And change and turn to a frisky rabbit,"
1012,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",A plump young gadabout cheerful fellow
1013,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","With a twitching nose and a coat of yellow,"
1014,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",And never the smallest trace of fear
1015,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",From his flashing scut to his flattened ear.
1016,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",
1017,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","But, lo, there's a hint of coming rain,"
1018,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY","So, presto, Robin is back again."
1019,"ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY",He lifts his head and he cocks his eye

1105,THE DANCE,With a pointing of toes and a lifting of wrists
1106,THE DANCE,They are off through the whirls and the twirls and the twists;
1107,THE DANCE,"Thread the mazes of marvellous figures, and chime"
1108,THE DANCE,"With a bow to a curtsey, and always keep time:"
1109,THE DANCE,All the gallant and girls
1110,THE DANCE,"In their diamonds and pearls,"
1111,THE DANCE,"And their gauze and their sparkles, designed for a dance"
1112,THE DANCE,By the leaders of fairy-land fashion in France.

1114,THE DANCE,"But the old lady fairies sit out by the trees,"
1115,THE DANCE,And the old beaux attend them as pert as you please.

1123,THE DANCE,"But at last, though the music goes gallantly on,"
1124,THE DANCE,"And the dancers are none of them weary or gone,"
1125,THE DANCE,"When the gauze is in rags and the hair is awry,"
1126,THE DANCE,Comes a light in the East and a sudden cock-cry.
1127,THE DANCE,With a scurry of fear
1128,THE DANCE,"Then they all disappear,"

1178,I,
1179,I,"This is the tale the old men tell, the tale that was told to me,"
1180,I,"Of the blue-green dragon,"
1181,I,"The dreadful dragon,"
1182,I,"The dragon who flew so free,"
1183,I,The last of his horrible scaly race
1184,I,Who settled and made his nesting place
1185,I,Some hundreds of thousands of years ago.
1186,I,"One day, as the light was falling low"
1187,I,"And the turbulent wind was still,"
1188,I,"In a stony hollow,"
1189,I,"Where none dared follow,"
1190,I,"Beyond the ridge on the gorse-clad summit, the summit of Winter Hill!"
1191,I,
1192,I,The news went round in the camp that night;
1193,I,it was Dickon who brought it first
1194,I,"How the wonderful dragon,"
1195,I,"The fiery dragon,"
1196,I,On his terrified eyes had burst.
1197,I,
1198,I,"""I was out,"" he said, ""for a fat young buck,"
1199,I,But never a touch I had of luck;
1200,I,And still I wandered and wandered on
1201,I,Till all the best of the day was gone;
1202,I,"When, suddenly, lo, in a flash of flame"
1203,I,"Full over the ridge a green head came,"
1204,I,"A green head flapped with a snarling lip,"
1205,I,And a long tongue set with an arrow's tip.
1206,I,"I own I didn't stand long at bay,"
1207,I,"But I cast my arrows and bow away,"
1208,I,"And I cast my coat, and I changed my plan,"
1209,I,"And forgot the buck, and away I ran--"
1210,I,"And, oh, but my heart was chill:"
1211,I,For still as I ran I heard the bellow
1212,I,Of the terrible slaughtering fierce-eyed fellow
1213,I,"Who has made his lair on the gorse-clad summit,"
1214,I,"the summit of Winter Hill."""
1215,I,
1216,I,"Then the women talked, as the women will, and the men-folk they talked too"
1217,I,"Of the raging dragon,"
1218,I,"The hungry dragon,"
1219,I,The dragon of green and blue.
1220,I,"And the Bards with their long beards flowing down,"
1221,I,They sat apart and were seen to frown.
1222,I,
1223,I,"But at last the Chief Bard up and spoke,"
1224,I,"""Now I swear by beech and I swear by oak,"
1225,I,"By the grass and the streams I swear,"" said he,"
1226,I,"""This dragon of Dickon's puzzles me."
1227,I,"For the record stands, as well ye know,"
1228,I,How a hundred years and a year ago
1229,I,We dealt the dragons a smashing blow
1230,I,By issuing from our magic tree
1231,I,"A carefully-framed complete decree,"
1232,I,Which ordered dragons to cease to be.
1233,I,"Still, since our Dickon is passing sure"
1234,I,That he saw a regular Simon pure.
1235,I,"Some dragon's egg, as it seems, contrived"
1236,I,"To elude our curses, and so survived"
1237,I,"On an inaccessible rocky shelf,"
1238,I,Where at last it managed to hatch itself.
1239,I,"Whatever the cause, the result is plain:"
1240,I,We're in for a dragon-fuss again.
1241,I,"We haven't the time, and, what is worse,"
1242,I,We haven't the means to frame a curse.
1243,I,So what is there left for us to say
1244,I,"Save this, that our men at break of day"
1245,I,Must gather and go to kill
1246,I,The monstrous savage

1248,I,"The flocks and herds on the gorse-clad summit,"
1249,I,"the summit of Winter Hill?"""
1250,I,
1251,II,II
1252,II,
1253,II,"So the men, when they heard the Chief Bard utter the order that bade them"
1254,II,try
1255,II,"For the awful dragon,"
1256,II,"The dauntless dragon,"
1257,II,"They all of them shouted ""Aye!"""
1258,II,"For everyone felt assured that he,"
1259,II,"Whatever the fate of the rest might be,"
1260,II,"However few of them might survive,"
1261,II,"Was certainly safe to stay alive,"
1262,II,And was probably bound to deal the blow
1263,II,"That would shatter the beast and lay him low,"
1264,II,And end the days of their dragon-foe.
1265,II,And all the women-folk egged them on:
1266,II,"It was ""Up with your heart, and at him, John!"""
1267,II,"Or ""Gurth, you'll bring me his ugly head,"""
1268,II,"Or ""Lance, my man, when you've struck him dead,"
1269,II,"When he hasn't a wag in his fearful tail,"
1270,II,"Carve off and bring me a blue-green scale."""
1271,II,
1272,II,Then they set to work at their swords and spears--
1273,II,Such a polishing hadn't been seen for years.
1274,II,"They made the tips of their arrows sharp,"
1275,II,"Re-strung and burnished the Chief Bard's harp,"
1276,II,"Dragged out the traditional dragon-bag,"
1277,II,Sewed up the rents in the tribal flag;
1278,II,And all in the midst of the talk and racket
1279,II,Each wife was making her man a packet--
1280,II,A hunch of bread and a wedge of cheese
1281,II,"And a nubble of beef, and, to moisten these,"
1282,II,"A flask of her home-brewed, not too thin,"
1283,II,As a driving force for his javelin
1284,II,When the moment arrived to spill
1285,II,The blood of the terror
1286,II,Hatched out in error
1287,II,"Who had perched his length on the gorse-clad summit,"
1288,II,the summit of Winter Hill.
1289,II,
1290,II,"The night had taken her feast of stars, and the sun shot up in flame,"
1291,II,"When ""Now for the dragon!"
1292,II,"Who hunts the dragon?"""
1293,II,The call from the watchers came;
1294,II,"And, shaking the mists of sleep away,"
1295,II,"The men stepped into the light of day,"
1296,II,Twice two hundred in loose array;
1297,II,With a good round dozen of bards to lead them
1298,II,"And their wives all waving their hands to speed them,"
1299,II,"While the Chief Bard, fixed in his chair of state,"
1300,II,With his harp and his wreath looked most sedate.
1301,II,It wasn't his place to fight or tramp;
1302,II,When the warriors went he stayed in camp;
1303,II,But still from his chair he harped them on
1304,II,"Till the very last of the host had gone,"
1305,II,Then he yawned and solemnly shook his head
1306,II,"And, leaving his seat, returned to bed,"
1307,II,"To sleep, as a good man will"
1308,II,"Who, braving malice and tittle-tattle,"
1309,II,"Has checked his natural lust for battle,"
1310,II,"And sent the rest to the gorse-clad summit,"
1311,II,the summit of Winter Hill.
1312,II,
1313,III,III
1314,III,
1315,III,"Marching at ease in the cheerful air, on duty and daring bent,"
1316,III,"In quest of the dragon,"
1317,III,"The fateful dragon,"
1318,III,The fierce four hundred went:
1319,III,"Over the hills and through the plain,"
1320,III,And up the slopes of the hills again.
1321,III,"The sleek rooks, washed in the morning's dew,"
1322,III,Rose at their coming and flapped and flew
1323,III,In a black procession athwart the blue;
1324,III,And the plovers circled about on high
1325,III,With many a querulous piping cry.
1326,III,And the cropping ewes and the old bell-wether
1327,III,Looked up in terror and pushed together;
1328,III,And still with a grim unbroken pace
1329,III,The men moved on to their battle-place.
1330,III,"Softly, silently, all tip-toeing,"
1331,III,"With their lips drawn tight and their eyes all glowing,"
1332,III,With gleaming teeth and straining ears
1333,III,"And the sunshine laughing on swords and spears,"
1334,III,"Softly, silently on they go"
1335,III,To the hidden lair of the fearful foe.
1336,III,"They have neared the stream, they have crossed the bridge,"
1337,III,"And they stop in sight of the rugged ridge,"
1338,III,"And it's ""Flankers back!"" and ""Skirmishers in!"""
1339,III,And the summit is theirs to lose or win--
1340,III,To win with honour or lose with shame;
1341,III,"And so to the place itself they came,"
1342,III,And gazed with an awful thrill
1343,III,"At the ridge of omen,"
1344,III,"Beset by foemen,"
1345,III,"At the arduous summit, the gorse-clad summit,"
1346,III,the summit of Winter Hill.
1347,III,
1348,III,"But where was the dragon, the scale-clad dragon,"
1349,III,"the dragon that Dickon saw,"
1350,III,"The genuine dragon,"
1351,III,"The pitiless dragon,"
1352,III,The dragon that knew no law?
1353,III,"Lo, just as the word to charge rang out,"
1354,III,"And before they could give their battle shout,"
1355,III,On a stony ledge
1356,III,"Of the ridge's edge,"
1357,III,"With its lips curled back and its teeth laid bare,"
1358,III,"And a hiss that ripped the morning air,"
1359,III,With its backbone arched
1360,III,"And its tail well starched,"
1361,III,"With bristling hair and flattened ears,"
1362,III,What shape of courage and wrath appears?
1363,III,"A cat, a tortoiseshell mother-cat!"
1364,III,And a very diminutive cat at that!
1365,III,"And below her, nesting upon the ground,"
1366,III,A litter of tiny kits they found:
1367,III,"Tortoiseshell kittens, one, two, three,"
1368,III,Lying as snug as snug could be.
1369,III,And they took the kittens with shouts of laughter
1370,III,"And turned for home, and the cat came after."
1371,III,"And when in the camp they told their tale,"
1372,III,The women--but stop! I draw a veil.
1373,III,The cat had tent-life forced upon her
1374,III,And was kept in comfort and fed with honour;
1375,III,But Dickon has heard his fill
1376,III,Of the furious dragon
1377,III,They tried to bag on
1378,III,"The dragonless summit, the gorse-clad summit,"
1379,III,the summit of Winter Hill!

1646,JOHN,His two short legs having failed to score
1647,JOHN,In a sudden match against Lufra's four.
1648,JOHN,
1649,JOHN,But we picked him up
1650,JOHN,"And we brushed him down,"
1651,JOHN,And he rated the pup
1652,JOHN,With a dreadful frown;
1653,JOHN,"And then he laughed and he went and hugged her,"
1654,JOHN,"Seized her tail in his fist and tugged her,"
1655,JOHN,"And so, with a sister's hand to guide him,"
1656,JOHN,Continued his march with the dog beside him.
1657,JOHN,
1658,JOHN,And soon he waggles his way upstairs--
1659,JOHN,"He does it alone, though he finds it steep."
1660,JOHN,"He is stripped and gowned, and he says his prayers,"
1661,JOHN,And he condescends
1662,JOHN,To admit his friends
1663,JOHN,To a levée before he goes to sleep.
1664,JOHN,He thrones it there
1665,JOHN,With a battered bear
1666,JOHN,"And a tattered monkey to form his Court,"
1667,JOHN,"And, having come to the end of day,"
1668,JOHN,Conceives that this is the time for play
1669,JOHN,And every possible kind of sport.
1670,JOHN,
1671,JOHN,"But at last, tucked in for the hundredth time,"
1672,JOHN,"He babbles a bit of nursery rhyme,"
1673,JOHN,And on the bed
1674,JOHN,"Droops his curly round head,"
1675,JOHN,Gives one long sigh of unalloyed content
1676,JOHN,"Over a day so well, so proudly spent,"
1677,JOHN,"Resigned at last to listen and obey,"

2041,THE DOGS' WELCOME,"And John, who is plump, got an awful bump,"
2042,THE DOGS' WELCOME,"and Helen, who's tall and thin,"
2043,THE DOGS' WELCOME,Was shot through a shrub and gained in bruise
2044,THE DOGS' WELCOME,as much as she lost in skin;
2045,THE DOGS' WELCOME,"And Rosamond's frock was rent in rags, and tattered in strips was Peg's,"
2046,THE DOGS' WELCOME,And both of them suffered the ninepin fate to the ruin of arms and legs;

2368,THE OLD GREY MARE,There's a line of rails on an upland green
2369,THE OLD GREY MARE,"With a good take-off and a landing sound,"
2370,THE OLD GREY MARE,"Six fences grim as were ever seen,"
2371,THE OLD GREY MARE,And it's there I would be with fox and hound.
2372,THE OLD GREY MARE,"Oh, that was a country free and fair"

2379,THE OLD GREY MARE,"It was ""Up to it, lass,"" and before I knew"
2380,THE OLD GREY MARE,"We were up and over, and on we flew."
2381,THE OLD GREY MARE,
2382,THE OLD GREY MARE,"The rooks from the grass got up, and so,"
2383,THE OLD GREY MARE,"With a caw and flap, away they went;"
2384,THE OLD GREY MARE,When the grey mare made up her mind to go
2385,THE OLD GREY MARE,"At the tail of the bounds on a breast-high scent,"
2386,THE OLD GREY MARE,The best of the startled rooks might fail
2387,THE OLD GREY MARE,To match her flight over post and rail.
2388,THE OLD GREY MARE,
2389,THE OLD GREY MARE,"While some of the thrusters grew unnerved,"
2390,THE OLD GREY MARE,"And looked and longed for an open gate,"
2391,THE OLD GREY MARE,"And one crashed down and another swerved,"
2392,THE OLD GREY MARE,She went for it always true and straight:
2393,THE OLD GREY MARE,"She pounded the lot, for she made it good"
2394,THE OLD GREY MARE,With never a touch of splintered wood.
2395,THE OLD GREY MARE,
2396,THE OLD GREY MARE,Full many a year has come and gone
2397,THE OLD GREY MARE,"Since last she gathered her spring for me,"
2398,THE OLD GREY MARE,"And lifted me up, and so flew on"
2399,THE OLD GREY MARE,Unchecked in a country fair and free.
2400,THE OLD GREY MARE,"I've ridden a score since then, but ne'er"
2401,THE OLD GREY MARE,Crossed one that could live with the old grey mare.
