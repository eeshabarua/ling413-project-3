47,_THE DESERTER_,_THE DESERTER_
48,_THE DESERTER_,
49,_THE DESERTER_,
50,_THE DESERTER_,"“I’m sorry I done it, Major.”"
51,_THE DESERTER_,We bandaged the livid face;
52,_THE DESERTER_,"And led him out, ere the wan sun rose,"
53,_THE DESERTER_,To die his death of disgrace.
54,_THE DESERTER_,
55,_THE DESERTER_,The bolt-heads locked to the cartridge;
56,_THE DESERTER_,"The rifles steadied to rest,"
57,_THE DESERTER_,As cold stock nestled at colder cheek
58,_THE DESERTER_,And foresight lined on the breast.
59,_THE DESERTER_,
60,_THE DESERTER_,“_Fire!_” called the Sergeant-Major.
61,_THE DESERTER_,The muzzles flamed as he spoke:
62,_THE DESERTER_,And the shameless soul of a nameless man
63,_THE DESERTER_,Went up in the cordite-smoke.
64,_THE DESERTER_,
65,_THE DESERTER_,
66,_THE DESERTER_,
67,_THE DESERTER_,
68,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_
69,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,
70,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,
71,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"Up from the fret of the earth-world, through the Seven Circles of"
72,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"Flame,"
73,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"With the seven holes in Its tunic for sign of the death-in-shame,"
74,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,To the little gate of Valhalla the coward-spirit came.
75,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,
76,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"Cold, It crouched in the man-strong wind that sweeps Valhalla’s"
77,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,floor;
78,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"Weak, It pawed and scratched on the wood; and howled, like a dog,"
79,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,at the Door
80,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"Which is shut to the souls who are sped in shame, for ever and"
81,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,evermore:
82,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,
83,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,For It snuffed the Meat of the Banquet-boards where the Threefold
84,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"Killers sit,"
85,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"Where the Free Beer foams to the tankard-rim, and the Endless Smokes"
86,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,are lit....
87,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,And It saw the Nakéd Eye come out above the lintel-slit.
88,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,
89,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,And now It quailed at Nakéd Eye which judges the naked dead;
90,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,And now It snarled at Nakéd Truth that broodeth overhead;
91,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,And now It looked to the earth below where the gun-flames flickered
92,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,red.
93,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,
94,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"It muttered words It had learned on earth, the words of a black-coat"
95,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,priest
96,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,Who had bade It pray to a pulpit god--but ever Eye’s Wrath
97,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,increased;
98,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"And It knew that Its words were empty words, and It whined like a"
99,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,homeless beast:
100,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,
101,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"Till, black above the lintel-slit, the Nakéd Eye went out;"
102,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"Till, loud across the Killer-Feasts, It heard the Killer-Shout--"
103,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,"The three-fold song of them that slew, and died ... and had no"
104,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,doubt.
105,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,
106,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,
107,_THE EYE AND THE TRUTH_,

109,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_
110,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
111,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
112,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"_Below your black priest’s heaven,"
113,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Above his tinselled hell,"
114,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Beyond the Circles Seven,"
115,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,The Red-Steel Killers dwell--
116,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"The men who drave, to blade-ring home, behind the marching shell._"
117,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
118,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"We knew not good nor evil,"
119,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Save only right of blade;
120,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Yet neither god nor devil
121,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Could hold us from our trade,"
122,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"When once we watched the barrage lift, and splendidly afraid"
123,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
124,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Came scrambling out of cover,"
125,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,And staggered up the hill....
126,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,The bullets whistled over;
127,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Our sudden dead lay still;
128,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,And the mad machine-gun chatter drove us fighting-wild to kill.
129,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
130,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Then the death-light lit our faces,"
131,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,And the death-mist floated red
132,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,O’er the crimson cratered places
133,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Where his outposts crouched in dread....
134,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,And we stabbed or clubbed them as they crouched; and shot them as
135,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,they fled;
136,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
137,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"And floundered, torn and bleeding,"
138,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Over trenches, through the wire,"
139,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,With the shrapnel-barrage leading
140,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,To the prey of our desire--
141,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,To the men who rose to meet us from the blood-soaked battle-mire;
142,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
143,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Met them; gave and asked no quarter;
144,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"But, where we saw the Gray,"
145,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Plunged the edged steel of slaughter,"
146,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Stabbed home, and wrenched away...."
147,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Till red wrists tired of killing-work, and none were left to slay."
148,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
149,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Now--while his fresh battalions
150,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Moved up to the attack--
151,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Screaming like angry stallions,"
152,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"His shells came charging back,"
153,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,And stamped the ground with thunder-hooves and pawed it
154,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,spouting-black
155,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
156,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,And breathed down poison-stenches
157,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Upon us, leaping past...."
158,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Panting, we turned his trenches;"
159,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,And heard--each time we cast
160,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,From parapet to parados--the scything bullet-blast.
161,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
162,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Till the whistle told his coming;
163,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Till we flung away the pick,"
164,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Heard our Lewis guns’ crazed drumming,"
165,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Grabbed our rifles, sighted quick,"
166,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Fired ... and watched his wounded writhing back from where his dead
167,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,lay thick.
168,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
169,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,So we laboured--while we lasted:
170,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Soaked in rain or parched in sun;
171,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Bullet-riddled; fire-blasted;
172,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Poisoned: fodder for the gun:
173,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"So we perished, and our bodies rotted in the ground they won."
174,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
175,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"It heard the song of the First of the Dead, as It couched by the"
176,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,lintel-post;
177,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,And the coward-soul would have given Its soul to be back with the
178,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,Red-Steel host....
179,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,But Eye peered down; and It quailed at the Eye; and Nakéd Truth
180,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,said: “Lost.”
181,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
182,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"And Eye went out. But It might not move; for, droned in the dark, It"
183,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,heard
184,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,The Second Song of the Killer-men--word upon awful word
185,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,"Cleaving the void with a shrill, keen sound like the wings of a"
186,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,pouncing bird.
187,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
188,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
189,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
190,_THE SONG OF THE RED-EDGED STEEL_,
191,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_
192,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
193,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
194,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"_Higher than tinselled heaven,"
195,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Lower than angels dare,"
196,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Loop to the fray, swoop on their prey,"
197,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The Killers of the Air._
198,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
199,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"We scorned the Galilean,"
200,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,We mocked at Kingdom-Come:
201,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The old gods knew our pæan--
202,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,Our dawn-loud engine-hum:
203,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
204,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"The old red gods of slaughter,"
205,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The gods before the Jew!
206,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"We heard their cruel laughter,"
207,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Shrill round us, as we flew:"
208,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
209,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"When, deaf to earth and pity,"
210,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Blind to the guns beneath,"
211,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,We loosed upon the city
212,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,Our downward-plunging death.
213,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
214,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The Sun-God watched our flighting;
215,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,No Christian priest could tame
216,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,Our deathly stuttered fighting:--
217,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"The whirled drum, spitting flame;"
218,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
219,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"The roar, of blades behind her;"
220,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The banking plane up-tossed;
221,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The swerve that sought to blind her;
222,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Masked faces, glimpsed and lost;"
223,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
224,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The joy-stick wrenched to guide her;
225,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"The swift and saving zoom,"
226,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,What time the shape beside her
227,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,Went spinning to its doom.
228,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
229,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,No angel-wings might follow
230,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Where, poised behind the fray,"
231,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,We spied our Lord Apollo
232,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,Stoop down to mark his prey--
233,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
234,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The hidden counter-forces;
235,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The guns upon the road;
236,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"The tethered transport-horses,"
237,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Stampeding, as we showed--"
238,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
239,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Dun hawks of death, loud-roaring--"
240,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,A moment to their eyes:
241,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,And slew; and passed far-soaring;
242,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,And dwindled up the skies.
243,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
244,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,But e’en Apollo’s pinions
245,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Had faltered where we ran,"
246,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Low through his veiled dominions,"
247,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,To lead the charging van!
248,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
249,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The tree-tops slathered under;
250,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"The Red-Steel Killers knew,"
251,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Hard overhead, the thunder"
252,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,And backwash of her screw;
253,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
254,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The blurred clouds raced above her;
255,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"The blurred fields streaked below,"
256,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Where waited, crouched to cover,"
257,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,The foremost of our foe;
258,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
259,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Banking, we saw his furrows"
260,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"Leap at us, open wide:"
261,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,Hell-raked the man-packed burrows;
262,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"And crashed--and crashing, died."
263,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
264,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"It heard the song of the Dead in Air, as It huddled against the"
265,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,gate;
266,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,And once again the Eye peered down--red-rimmed with scorn and hate
267,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,For the shameless soul of the nameless one who had neither foe nor
268,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,mate.
269,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
270,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,And Eye was shut. But Nakéd Truth bent down to mock the Thing:--
271,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"“Thou hast heard the Song of the Red-edged Steel, and the Song of"
272,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,the Crashing Wing:
273,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,Shall the word of a black-coat priest avail at Valhalla’s
274,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,harvesting?
275,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
276,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,Shalt _thou_ pass free to the Seven Halls--whose life in shame was
277,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,sped?”
278,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,"And Truth was dumb. But the brooding word still echoed overhead,"
279,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,As roaring down the void outburst the last loud song of the dead.
280,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
281,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
282,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
283,_THE SONG OF THE CRASHING WING_,
284,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_
285,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
286,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
287,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"_In Thor’s own red Valhalla,"
288,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Which priest may not unbar;
289,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"But only Nakéd Truth and Eye,"
290,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Last arbiters of War;
291,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Feast, by stark right of courage,"
292,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,The Killers from Afar._
293,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
294,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"We put no trust in heaven,"
295,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,We had no fear of hell;
296,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"But lined, and ranged, and timed to clock,"
297,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Our barrage-curtains fell,"
298,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,When guns gave tongue and breech-blocks swung
299,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,And palms rammed home the shell.
300,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
301,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"The Red-Steel ranks edged forward,"
302,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,And vanished in our smoke;
303,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Back from his churning craters,"
304,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,The Gray Man reeled and broke;
305,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"While, fast as sweat could lay and set,"
306,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Our rocking muzzles spoke.
307,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
308,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,We blew him from the village;
309,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,We chased him through the wood:
310,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Till, tiny on the crest-line"
311,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Where once his trenches stood,"
312,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,We watched the wag of sending flag
313,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,That told our work was good:
314,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
315,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Till, red behind the branches,"
316,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,The death-sun sank to blood;
317,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,And the Red-Steel Killers rested....
318,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"But we, by swamp and flood,"
319,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Through mirk and night--his shells for light--
320,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Blaspheming, choked with mud,"
321,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
322,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Roped to the tilting axles,"
323,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Man-handled up the crest;
324,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,And wrenched our plunging gun-teams
325,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Foam-flecked from jowl to breast,"
326,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Downwards, and on, where trench-lights shone--"
327,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"For _we_, we might not rest!"
328,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
329,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Shell-deafened; soaked and sleepless;
330,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Short-handed; under fire;
331,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Days upon nights unending,"
332,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"We wrought, and dared not tire--"
333,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"With whip and bit from dump to pit,"
334,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,From pit to trench with wire.
335,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
336,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"The Killers in the Open,"
337,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"The Killers down the Wind,"
338,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,They saw the Gray Man eye to eye--
339,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"But _we_, we fought him blind,"
340,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Nor knew whence came the screaming flame
341,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"That killed us, miles behind."
342,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
343,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Yet, when the triple rockets"
344,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Flew skyward, blazed and paled,"
345,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,For sign the lines were broken;
346,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,When the Red Steel naught availed;
347,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"When, through the smoke, on shield and spoke"
348,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,His rifle bullets hailed;
349,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
350,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"When we waited, dazed and hopeless,"
351,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Till the layer’s eye could trace
352,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Helmets, bobbing just above us"
353,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Like mad jockeys in a race....
354,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,"Then--loaded, laid, and unafraid,"
355,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,We met him face to face;
356,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
357,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Jerked the trigger; felt the trunnions
358,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Rock and quiver; saw the flail
359,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Of our zero-fuses blast him;
360,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Saw his gapping ranks turn tail;
361,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,Heard the charging-cheer behind us ...
362,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,And dropped dead across the trail.
363,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
364,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
365,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
366,_THE SONG OF THE GUNNER-DEAD_,
367,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_
368,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,
369,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,
370,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,It heard the Song of the Gunner-Dead die out to a sullen roar:
371,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,But Nakéd Truth said never a word; and Eye peered down no more.
372,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,For Eye had seen; and Truth had judged ... and It might not pass
373,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,the Door!
374,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,
375,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,"And now, like a dog in the dark, It shrank from the voice of a man"
376,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,It knew:--
377,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,"“There are empty seats at the Banquet-board, but there’s never a"
378,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,seat for you;
379,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,"For they will not drink with a coward soul, the stark red men who"
380,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,slew.
381,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,
382,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,"There’s meat and to spare, at the Killer-Feasts where Thor’s swung"
383,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,hammer twirls;
384,_VALHALLA’S VERDICT_,"There’s beer and enough, in the Free Canteen where the Endless Smoke"

811,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Their five-nines pounding bits to dustier bits--
812,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Behind, a cratered slope, with batteries"
813,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Crashing and flashing, violet in the dusk,"
814,_THE OTHER SIDE_,And prematuring every now and then--
815,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"In front, the ragged Bois de Bernafay,"
816,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Bosche whizz-bangs bursting white among its trees.
817,_THE OTHER SIDE_,
818,_THE OTHER SIDE_,You had been doing F.O.O. that day;
819,_THE OTHER SIDE_,(The Staff knows why we had an F.O.O.:
820,_THE OTHER SIDE_,One couldn’t flag-wag through Trônes Wood; the wires
821,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Went down as fast as one could put them up;
822,_THE OTHER SIDE_,And messages by runner took three hours.)
823,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"I got the wind up rather: you were late,"
824,_THE OTHER SIDE_,And they’d been shelling like the very deuce.
825,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"However, back you came. I see you now,"
826,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Staggering into “mess”--a broken trench,"
827,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Two chalk-walls roofed with corrugated iron,"
828,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"And, round the traverse, Driver Noakes’s stove"
829,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Stinking and smoking while we ate our grub.
830,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Your face was blue-white, streaked with dirt; your eyes"
831,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Had shrunk into your head, as though afraid"
832,_THE OTHER SIDE_,To watch more horrors; you were sodden-wet
833,_THE OTHER SIDE_,With greasy coal-black mud--and other things.
834,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Sweating and shivering, speechless, there you stood."
835,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"I gave you whisky, made you talk. You said:"
836,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"“Major, another signaller’s been killed.”"
837,_THE OTHER SIDE_,“Who?”
838,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"“Gunner Andrews, blast them. O my Christ!"
839,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"His head--split open--when his brains oozed out,"
840,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"They looked like bloody sweetbreads, in the muck.”"
841,_THE OTHER SIDE_,
842,_THE OTHER SIDE_,And you’re the chap who writes this claptrap verse!
843,_THE OTHER SIDE_,
844,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Lord, if I’d half _your_ brains, I’d write a book:"
845,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"None of your sentimental platitudes,"
846,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"But something real, vital; that should strip"
847,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"The glamour from this outrage we call war,"
848,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Shewing it naked, hideous, stupid, vile--"
849,_THE OTHER SIDE_,One vast abomination. So that they
850,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Who, coming after, till the ransomed fields"
851,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Where our lean corpses rotted in the ooze,"
852,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Reading my written words, should understand"
853,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"This stark stupendous horror, visualize"
854,_THE OTHER SIDE_,The unutterable foulness of it all....
855,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"I’d shew them, not your glamourous “glorious game,”"
856,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Which men play “jesting” “for their honour’s sake”--
857,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"(A kind of Military Tournament,"
858,_THE OTHER SIDE_,With just a hint of danger--bound in cloth!)--
859,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"But War,--as war is now, and always was:"
860,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"A dirty, loathsome, servile murder-job:--"
861,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Men, lousy, sleepless, ulcerous, afraid,"
862,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Toiling their hearts out in the pulling slime
863,_THE OTHER SIDE_,That wrenches gum-boot down from bleeding heel
864,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"And cakes in itching arm-pits, navel, ears:"
865,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Men stunned to brainlessness, and gibbering:"
866,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Men driving men to death and worse than death:
867,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Men maimed and blinded: men against machines--
868,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Flesh versus iron, concrete, flame and wire:"
869,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Men choking out their souls in poison-gas:
870,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Men squelched into the slime by trampling feet:
871,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Men, disembowelled by guns five miles away,"
872,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Cursing, with their last breath, the living God"
873,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Because he made them, in His image, men...."
874,_THE OTHER SIDE_,So--were your talent mine--I’d write of war
875,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"For those who, coming after, know it not."
876,_THE OTHER SIDE_,
877,_THE OTHER SIDE_,And if posterity should ask of me
878,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"What high, what base emotions keyed weak flesh"
879,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"To face such torments, I would answer: “_You!_"
880,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Not for themselves, O daughters, grandsons, sons,"
881,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Your tortured forebears wrought this miracle;
882,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"Not for themselves, _accomplished utterly_"
883,_THE OTHER SIDE_,This loathliest task of murderous servitude;
884,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"But just because they realized that thus,"
885,_THE OTHER SIDE_,"_And only thus_, by sacrifice, might they"
886,_THE OTHER SIDE_,Secure a world worth living in--_for you_.” ...

900,I.,_Wherein the bard--released from War’s confusions--
901,I.,Preludes with egotistical allusions._
902,I.,
903,I.,Six years ago--or is it six-and-twenty?
904,I.,(How vast the gulf from those ecstatic days!)--
905,I.,When the whole earth snored on in slothful plenty
906,I.,(Tho’ poets cashed small pittance for their lays);
907,I.,"When war appeared less real than G. A. Henty,"
908,I.,And Oxo’s snaky signs were yet ablaze;
909,I.,"When all seemed peaceful as the press of Cadbury,"
910,I.,"And no one dreamed of bombs, or bet a Bradbury;"
911,I.,
912,I.,"Or e’er stern Mars had roped us in his tether,"
913,I.,Ere British guns had thundered at Le Câteau:
914,I.,We fitted out--my Muse and I together--
915,I.,And launched adown the galley-slips of Chatto
916,I.,"A barque of verse, full-rigged for halcyon weather,"
917,I.,Which many a critic judged to take the _gâteau_:
918,I.,"(Though some there were, high pundits of disparity,"
919,I.,Who wept at our unscholarly vulgarity).
920,I.,
921,I.,We have sailed far since then; crossed our horizon;
922,I.,Published our loves and travels in a novel
923,I.,"(A tale, men say, that Peckham’s flapper cries on,"
924,I.,So that both Boots and Smith’s before us grovel);
925,I.,And eaten ration bully-beef--with flies on;
926,I.,"And sheltered gratefully in many a hovel,"
927,I.,What time we sang of guns and gore and trenches--
928,I.,"Instead of oysters, tango-teas and wenches."
929,I.,
930,I.,For times have changed since we wrote “One of Us”:
931,I.,_Et nos mutamus_--more or less--_in illis_.
932,I.,Muse finds herself _in urbe_ somewhat _rus_;
933,I.,And I--if I disport with Amaryllis--
934,I.,"Where once my motor flashed, prefer a ’bus;"
935,I.,And shuddering note how vast the supper-bill is;
936,I.,"And signing, sigh in secret for the calm,"
937,I.,"Chaste, cheap seclusion of my Chiltern farm."
938,I.,
939,I.,"Yes, Muse and I are tired, and super-serious:"
940,I.,"Her damask cheek is lined a bit, and wrinkled."
941,I.,"We are grown old, and London’s late nights weary us:"
942,I.,"While the gold wine that erst in ice-pail tinkled,"
943,I.,Her doctor finds extremely deleterious;
944,I.,"And mine forbids me red lips, passion-crinkled:"
945,I.,So now we cultivate domestic habits
946,I.,"Amongst our pigs, our poultry, and our rabbits."
947,I.,
948,I.,"Yet sometimes, as we trench our stubborn soil,"
949,I.,"Or feed our sows, or strow the peat-moss litter,"
950,I.,"Or set the morrow’s chicken-mash to boil,"
951,I.,"Or wander out where our young turkeys twitter,"
952,I.,Or read by mellow candle-light--since oil
953,I.,Is dear and scarce; or talk--a little bitter
954,I.,Because we find that Food Control Committees
955,I.,Are all composed of men brought up in cities;
956,I.,
957,I.,"Sometimes, in this five-acre paradise"
958,I.,Whither my nerve-racked spirit fled the battle
959,I.,Deferring to sound Harley Street advice--
960,I.,"A silver badge its only martial chattel,"
961,I.,"I hear a voice, loud as the market price"
962,I.,"That butchers bid for Rhondda’s missing cattle,"
963,I.,"Voice of my Muse, still vibrant with old passion,"
964,I.,Telling how poetry is now the fashion.
965,I.,
966,I.,"“Look you,” she cries, “the Wheels are turning, turning."
967,I.,"Though Pegasus long since wore out his pinions,"
968,I.,Somehow his shod hooves keep the bread-mills churning.
969,I.,"Shrill, night and day, sing Marsh Georgian minions:"
970,I.,"Each sinking sun sets some new Noyes a-burning,"
971,I.,Each rising moon reveals fresh hordes of Binyons;
972,I.,"Who batten fat on unsuspecting editors,"
973,I.,And--unlike you--contrive to pay their creditors.
974,I.,
975,I.,"“Poet, forsooth! You agricultural brute!"
976,I.,Have you no soul above the weight of porkers?
977,I.,"Was it for this I hearkened to your suit,"
978,I.,"Gave you my metres and my rhymes--some, corkers?"
979,I.,"Up, Gilbert! rummage out your rusty lute:"
980,I.,Polish it blacker than your black Minorcas:
981,I.,"And let its notes once more, in refluent stanzas,"
982,I.,Dower the Income-tax with glad Bonanzas.”
983,I.,
984,I.,So she; and--since I loathe to disappoint
985,I.,The least illusion of the equal sex--
986,I.,"Let Byron’s oil once more these locks anoint,"
987,I.,Once more let honour meet these Cox-drawn cheques ...
988,I.,"Though well I know that times are spare of joint,"
989,I.,And satire’s song less like to please than vex;
990,I.,"Now small beer, Smallwood, raids and strikes and rations,"
991,I.,Have near eclipsed the gaiety of nations:
992,I.,
993,I.,"Still, let me sing. Yet not as once I sung:"
994,I.,"Love, fear, and death have chastened, sobered, saddened,"
995,I.,One who knew life’s full burden-time too young;
996,I.,"Whom never youth’s unhampered freedom gladdened,"
997,I.,"But only envy and ambition stung,"
998,I.,And fickle passions--in love’s semblance maddened;
999,I.,"So that he needs must tumble now, poor clown,"
1000,I.,On this Pindaric stage for half-a-crown:
1001,I.,
1002,I.,"Yet one who, ’spite a past that shocked St. Tony"
1003,I.,"And paid recording angels overtime,"
1004,I.,Still holds his own at sonnet or _canzone_.
1005,I.,"As some shall know who follow this, my rhyme--"
1006,I.,"Some few: for gladly would I lay a pony,"
1007,I.,"Or larger sum, against a ten-cent dime,"
1008,I.,That most of those who read this metred tract’ll

1051,II.,Will find his Empire dividends signed “Henson”?
1052,II.,
1053,II.,Not I: not all the better men who fought

1070,II.,
1071,II.,"Which is, perchance, the reason why my mind"
1072,II.,"Turns oft to those dear days, now dead as mutton;"
1073,II.,When Haldane’s soul with Bethmann-Hollweg dined;

1076,II.,"Or dashed off shorthand _billets-doux_ in Dutton,"
1077,II.,Or changed a blear-eyed pauper to a swell man

1222,IV.,"Which runs: “In art, forbear to pick and choose. All"
1223,IV.,"That happens, happens. Wherefore, up and pen it!"
1224,IV.,Let the scribe’s tale be casual and cursory;
1225,IV.,End where you like--but start us in the nursery.”
1226,IV.,
1227,IV.,"And so I fain had traced, through many a canto,"
1228,IV.,My heroine; all dimples in her cot;
1229,IV.,Bored with her lessons; laughing at the panto.;
1230,IV.,Immersed in “Fauntleroy” or Walter Scott:
1231,IV.,"But, since green herbs from memory’s _campo santo_"
1232,IV.,"Provide no flavouring for satire’s pot,"
1233,IV.,"For seething, bubbling cauldron such as this is,"
1234,IV.,I’ll skip the skipping-rope and jump to kisses.

1237,IV.,
1238,IV.,’Tis such a night as only London knew
1239,IV.,In the full seasons of our heart’s content--
1240,IV.,"When, like some fairy pageant in review,"
1241,IV.,"Love, Pleasure, Luxury together blent,"
1242,IV.,Made life not all too boring for the Few;
1243,IV.,"And Unemployment, fix’t at ten per cent.,"
1244,IV.,Furnished--by all means of charity bazaars--
1245,IV.,Right many a dame with perquisites and “pars.”
1246,IV.,
1247,IV.,"London, in London’s June! Above, the starshine:"
1248,IV.,"Below, against the rails of Berkeley Square,"
1249,IV.,"The patient lights of brougham, or rarer car, shine--"
1250,IV.,Waiting stiff-shirted squires and ladies fair:
1251,IV.,"Music, from high French windows that afar shine,"
1252,IV.,"Thrills, till a dancer well might curse and swear,"
1253,IV.,And call himself a “dashed unlucky fella”
1254,IV.,To miss the Lewis-Seymour’s Cinderella.
1255,IV.,
1256,IV.,"Within those halls, where plush-breeched flunkeys stand,"
1257,IV.,"What sounds, what scents, what visions of delight!"
1258,IV.,How--to the bluest Blue Hungarian band--
1259,IV.,Youth whirls away the unreturning night!
1260,IV.,How--perfumed as the blooms of Samarcand--
1261,IV.,"The dying flow’rets whisper, “Carlton White!”"
1262,IV.,"But, oh! to weary war-time ration-hunters,"
1263,IV.,"How like a dream, this stand-up supper--Gunter’s!"
1264,IV.,
1265,IV.,"For here, in reach of every slender hand which is"
1266,IV.,"Scarce languidly outstretched to porcelain plate,"
1267,IV.,"Are dainties drawn from each vale, stream, or strand which is"
1268,IV.,Most famed for fruit or fish or fowl or cate:
1269,IV.,"Creamed strawberries; thin, lavish-buttered sandwiches"
1270,IV.,"Of livered geese (that now squawk Hymns of Hate),"
1271,IV.,Of priceless hams and tongues and caviar; ices;
1272,IV.,And sugared sweets in myriad strange devices....
1273,IV.,
1274,IV.,"Yet sweeter far than all these sweet things, Jill is:"
1275,IV.,Queen of my verse and this “Young People’s Dance”:
1276,IV.,Fairer than fairest of Mayfairy fillies!
1277,IV.,"Sweet, is the smile that lights a countenance"
1278,IV.,"Bright as moon-dappled, pink-tipped lotus-lilies;"
1279,IV.,"Sweet, are her jade-green eyes that gleam and glance--"
1280,IV.,And give no hint of yester-tea-time’s flare-up
1281,IV.,When stern mamma forbade her bind her hair up.
1282,IV.,
1283,IV.,Jill’s hair! How beautiful it is; the tresses
1284,IV.,"Warm-golden, soft as cygnet’s earliest downing."
1285,IV.,Jill’s foot! How slim the arch the flounce caresses.
1286,IV.,Jill’s brow! How pure; how yet uncreased in frowning.
1287,IV.,(My Muse! How easily the jade impresses
1288,IV.,On this base coin a stamp of pseudo-Browning.)
1289,IV.,Jill’s youth! Jill’s dreams! These luxuries that lap her!...
1290,IV.,Don’t they present a most alluring flapper?
1291,IV.,
1292,IV.,"So thinks, at least, this lad in evening raiment--"
1293,IV.,"Shoes, shirt-front, collar, waistcoat-buttons, glowing;"
1294,IV.,This sub. of other days--when soldier’s payment
1295,IV.,"Scarcely sufficed each monthly mess-bill’s owing,"
1296,IV.,And triple stars full fifteen years delay meant;
1297,IV.,"He, who presents the goblet, over-flowing"
1298,IV.,"With icy rubies to its crinkled brim,"
1299,IV.,And asks if Jill won’t “sit this out” with him....
1300,IV.,
1301,IV.,"And there it hangs, word-carven, my last image."
1302,IV.,"(Browning again! now Keats!) O hapless pair,"
1303,IV.,Loth lover and bold maiden of a dim age--
1304,IV.,"Lost to us now, and dead, but still most fair."
1305,IV.,"O Attic shapes! Arcadian girlhood’s slim age,"
1306,IV.,And silken youth with brilliantined hair!
1307,IV.,"What climaxes must I not sacrifice,"
1308,IV.,Who write this epic at a weekly price?
1309,IV.,
1310,IV.,"For--as long melodies are sweet, but sweeter"
1311,IV.,"Poems in short instalments, such as mine--"
1312,IV.,"Seven full days, teased puppet of this metre,"
1313,IV.,Must thy parched tongue await that roseate wine;
1314,IV.,"Seven full nights, fond boy, must thou entreat her;"
1315,IV.,"Whilst mantle to her cheeks, incarnadine,"
1316,IV.,"Youth’s beauty, beauty’s youth--and readers vex’t"
1317,IV.,"Know, need know, nothing more till Tuesday next."
1318,IV.,

1320,V.,V.
1321,V.,
1322,V.,_Brings life to week-old statues; makes them prance
1323,V.,To love’s light tune--and ends the Seymours’ dance._
1324,V.,
1325,V.,"Pale shapes I locked in memory’s studio,"
1326,V.,Your draperies stir. From vein to marble vein
1327,V.,"The life-blood leaps. Eyes gleam, and pulses glow."
1328,V.,Once more my octaves rap their old refrain
1329,V.,To re-create the weekly puppet-show.
1330,V.,"Fond boy, to work! My Jill’s herself again,"
1331,V.,And answers your entreaty--sideways glancing--
1332,V.,“Perhaps I will. It’s jolly hot for dancing.”
1333,V.,
1334,V.,So they twain pass--smart sub. and flapper stately--
1335,V.,From the high halls of Gunter’s prank’t refection.
1336,V.,"And out across the waxèd boards, where lately"
1337,V.,Twirled the swift waltz to _La Poupée’s_ “Selection.”
1338,V.,"And on, past couples gossiping sedately;"
1339,V.,"And on, past couples screened against detection;"
1340,V.,"To a dim-shaded, fairy-lighted alcove,"
1341,V.,Fit haunt for single maid and single tall cove:--
1342,V.,
1343,V.,"Such as--in land of Taj Mahal and mugger,"
1344,V.,Where girls book weeks ahead their supper dances--
1345,V.,"Screens some pale flirt, some lad who yearns to hug her,"
1346,V.,From the brown _khitmatghar’s_ averted glances.
1347,V.,"(Who knows thy secrets, darkling _Kala-juggah_--"
1348,V.,"The orbs downcast, the fingers’ coy advances,"
1349,V.,The swiftly stifled sob that hooks the stripling--
1350,V.,"Save I, Victoria Cross, and Rudyard Kipling!)"
1351,V.,
1352,V.,"And there, beneath the new-sponged potted palm-tree,"
1353,V.,That mid-day brought and morning shall remove--
1354,V.,"Mayfair’s own wind-unruffled, ever-calm tree,"
1355,V.,Whose drooping branches shield Mayfairies’ love--
1356,V.,"She lisps of Waller parts, and thy dead charm, Tree"
1357,V.,(Twin stars now shining in the “flies” above!);
1358,V.,While he admits he has or hasn’t seen them ...
1359,V.,"Till a shy sudden silence falls between them,"
1360,V.,A cloud across the sun of lightling banter.
1361,V.,
1362,V.,"O Jill, my gold-spoon cake-and-Moët miss!"
1363,V.,"Hast thou not dreamed, since thy first tam-o’-shanter,"
1364,V.,"Of soldier boy, of dance-night such as this?"
1365,V.,"Faintly they catch the polka’s throb, the canter"
1366,V.,Of homing hansom-cab where lovers kiss:
1367,V.,"And “Oh,” thinks he, “what eyes, what lips, what hair, too!”"
1368,V.,"And “Oh,” thinks she “the ninny doesn’t dare to.”"
1369,V.,
1370,V.,"Voiceless, they sit: but now her eyes, upturning,"
1371,V.,"Seek his: and now, beneath the lashes’ veil,"
1372,V.,Leaps a quick flame to set youth’s pulses burning;
1373,V.,And now she feels her resolution fail:
1374,V.,And now gains strength anew the curious yearning
1375,V.,"For love’s adventure: now, her fingers frail"
1376,V.,Tighten about the kerchief’s lacy tissue:
1377,V.,"And now, at last, he says, “Jill, I _must_ kiss you.”"
1378,V.,
1379,V.,"“Bobbie, you mustn’t.” “Jill--just one.” Her shoulder"
1380,V.,Stiffens; resists the half-encircling arm.
1381,V.,Hands fend away the hand that seeks to hold her.
1382,V.,Lips murmur. Lashes flutter in alarm.
1383,V.,"“No, Bobbie. No.” My foolish boy, be bolder;"
1384,V.,The moment’s fear is half the moment’s charm....
1385,V.,Alas! His missed and amateurish peck
1386,V.,Grazes the ear-lobe; lands upon the neck.
1387,V.,
1388,V.,"Readers, both kissed and kissless, chide not; pity"
1389,V.,These withered fruits from Jill’s dead seas of dreaming.
1390,V.,"Think--or in France, or in this barraged city,"
1391,V.,"How many a dear one owes his brass hat’s gleaming,"
1392,V.,"How many a husband thanks his safe Committee,"
1393,V.,To some fond woman’s sound strategic scheming!
1394,V.,"Ponder--can crafts which men from want to plenty ship,"
1395,V.,Be steered without an arduous apprenticeship?
1396,V.,
1397,V.,Ponder! Nor blame my Jill if she disguises
1398,V.,Love’s disappointment in disapprobation.
1399,V.,"If, Artemis in judgment now, she rises--"
1400,V.,"The outraged goddess, armed for flagellation--"
1401,V.,"And, with a voice whose every note comprises"
1402,V.,"Disgust, revolt, pain, virtue, indignation,"
1403,V.,"Drives from her father’s chaste, offended portals"
1404,V.,The meekest of apologising mortals.
1405,V.,
1406,V.,"And blame not me, her bard--whose verses weave her"
1407,V.,"This coronal of memory’s budding-hours,"
1408,V.,"Who loved her long ago, yet now must leave her"
1409,V.,"Lorn ’mid the dance’s _débris_, and the flowers"
1410,V.,Which fade as day-dreams of that first deceiver--
1411,V.,"Because, while War yet ravens and devours,"
1412,V.,"While still the blind guns thunder out in Flanders,"
1413,V.,I sing the type which cozens and philanders.
1414,V.,
1415,V.,"For, young as Spring and old as Cleopatra,"
1416,V.,"Certain as Nature’s self, this type endureth:"
1417,V.,"On Skindles’ lawn, in jungles of Sumatra,"
1418,V.,She blooms--a wax-white weed that no rake cureth:
1419,V.,"From Westminster to _wats_ of Pura Chatra,"
1420,V.,"Her false lips smile, her gladsome optic lureth:"
1421,V.,"WAAC’s may be WREN’s; wars, peace; to-day’s full Colonel,"
1422,V.,To-morrow’s clerk ... but Jill is sempiternal.

1432,VI.,"In London’s lanes, by Devon Budleigh’s farling,"
1433,VI.,"At Berkeley’s, Kettner’s, Ritz’s, Carlton’s board;"
1434,VI.,Jill whose white hands ne’er knew roughhouse-work’s gnarling;
1435,VI.,Whose clothes not twenty Coxes could afford!
1436,VI.,How shall man sing the seasoned cee-sprung carriage
1437,VI.,In which you rolled from that first kiss to marriage?
1438,VI.,
1439,VI.,What days they were! What noon-times and what twilights!
1440,VI.,The whole wide earth seemed fashioned for your pleasure;
1441,VI.,"Its very heavens, gold-and-crystal skylights"
1442,VI.,Whereunder you picked orchid blooms at leisure.
1443,VI.,"For others, shadowed gloom; for you, the high lights--"
1444,VI.,"The pomp, the pride, the dance’s twanging measure ..."
1445,VI.,"And if one begged: “Take coin,” you’d say, “and toss it her."

1448,VI.,"Dear, _rotten_ days! And yet, a Jack grows wistful"
1449,VI.,"At thoughts of all the Jills whom he remembers,"

1451,VI.,And fires of youth--where now are only embers.
1452,VI.,
1453,VI.,"Jack’s Jills! Why, Muse possesses quite a list full,"
1454,VI.,"May’s Jill, and June’s Jill, August’s, and September’s ..."

1456,VI.,Which followed on flirtationship’s indenture.
1457,VI.,
1458,VI.,"For there’s a tide in the affairs of flappers,"
1459,VI.,"Of those, at least, that West End mothers breed--"

1465,VI.,"To put it mildly, does the very deuce for ’em."
1466,VI.,
1467,VI.,"And shall my sweetest Muse, than whom none chaster"

1469,VI.,"Of any neurasthenic poetaster,"
1470,VI.,Ope her full throat to sing Jill’s ’prentice rage-time?--
1471,VI.,"The unnerving doubts, the certainties which braced her,"
1472,VI.,"The follied moments and the ensuing sage time,"
1473,VI.,"The major and the minor bards who sung to her,"

1476,VI.,"The last strange morning-dreams, the tea-tray’s rattle,"
1477,VI.,"The letters--opened, skimmed, and tossed aside;"
1478,VI.,"The leisured getting-up, the breakfast-prattle,"
1479,VI.,The summoning ’phone-bell and the mid-day ride;
1480,VI.,The lunch; the afternoons of tittle-tattle--
1481,VI.,"Town’s latest scandal, dance, divorce or bride;"
1482,VI.,"The “dear boys,” climbers, _partis_, portion-stalkers;"
1483,VI.,The furtive teas at Charbonnel and Walker’s;
1484,VI.,
1485,VI.,The Morny-scented bath before the dinner;
1486,VI.,The deft maid’s fingers in the unruly hair;
1487,VI.,"The _risqué_ talk of some sweet social sinner,"
1488,VI.,Half-heard across the table’s candle-glare;
1489,VI.,"The Bridge, so much too high for a beginner;"
1490,VI.,The Ball; the moment’s whisper on the stair:
