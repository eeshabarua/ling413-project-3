1694,CLORINDA,
1695,CLORINDA,A floor-walker whose faultlessness
1696,CLORINDA,And condescending air proclaimed
1697,CLORINDA,"One of the _table d’haute noblesse_,"
1698,CLORINDA,"Approached Clorinda and exclaimed,"
1699,CLORINDA,With graceful undulating palm:
1700,CLORINDA,"“Something in husbands? _Oui, Madame._”"
1701,CLORINDA,
1702,CLORINDA,“We have the latest thing of all
1703,CLORINDA,In husbands; kindly step this way.
1704,CLORINDA,"We’re using them on hats this fall,"
1705,CLORINDA,"In place of plume or floral spray,"

1708,CLORINDA,
1709,CLORINDA,"He leads the way, all wreathed in smiles,"
1710,CLORINDA,And wonderful in spotless spats
1711,CLORINDA,That flitter like twin butterflies
1712,CLORINDA,"Along an avenue of hats,"
1713,CLORINDA,Each one displaying on its brim
1714,CLORINDA,A husband--fashion’s latest whim.
1715,CLORINDA,
1716,CLORINDA,Clorinda tries them each in turn
1717,CLORINDA,"Before the glass; some are too small,"
1718,CLORINDA,"And some too cold, and some too stern,"
1719,CLORINDA,"And some are slightly soiled, and all,"
1720,CLORINDA,"When punctured by the hat-pin’s steel,"

1722,CLORINDA,
1723,CLORINDA,At last Clorinda came to one
1724,CLORINDA,"Marked “_Dibbs_,” that scarce seemed worth her while;"
1725,CLORINDA,"But when she tried it on for fun,"
1726,CLORINDA,"It met the hat-pin with a smile,"
1727,CLORINDA,"As if to say, “Oh, beauteous miss,"
1728,CLORINDA,Even a stab from you is bliss!”
1729,CLORINDA,
1730,CLORINDA,“The very thing! but thrown away
1731,CLORINDA,Upon a _hat_!” Clorinda cried.

1751,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"He exchanged for Marrons Glacés,"
1752,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Canvasback and Quail.
1753,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Flat the feast and dull the dinner
1754,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Lacking that accomplished Spinner
1755,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Of Postprandial Tale.
1756,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1757,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Every mail brought invitations:
1758,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Teas and luncheons and collations,"
1759,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Dinners without end.
1760,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,No one to a Formal Function
1761,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Such impressiveness, such unction,"
1762,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Such éclat could lend.
1763,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1764,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,At that gruesomest of gruesome
1765,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Rites, The Banquet tendered to some"
1766,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Literary Light,"
1767,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"None could say with such conviction,"
1768,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,“We have Snooks of _Snappy Fiction_
1769,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,In our midst To-night.”
1770,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1771,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,How he said it made no matter;
1772,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Shaft of Wit or Broadway Patter
1773,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Meets with like acclaim.
1774,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Latest Mot or Jest Historic,"
1775,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,To the dinner guest plethoric
1776,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,It is all the same.
1777,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1778,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"When he said, “This moment finds me"
1779,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Unprepared,” or, “That reminds me,”"
1780,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,There would be a hum
1781,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Of expectance, or a rippling"
1782,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,As though Daniel (or Kipling)
1783,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Had to Judgment come.
1784,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1785,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Alas for Fame! As A. J. Skinner
1786,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Put it at the Author’s Dinner,"
1787,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,“Fame’s a fickle Jade!”
1788,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Had he then an intimation
1789,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,That his own wide reputation
1790,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Was ere long to fade?
1791,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1792,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,From that day his after-dinner
1793,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Stories thinner grew and thinner.
1794,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Sorry was his case.
1795,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Rare the dinner invitation,"
1796,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Rarer still the lunch--Starvation
1797,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Stared him in the face.
1798,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1799,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,One day as his eye was wandering
1800,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"O’er a map, he fell to pondering:"
1801,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"“If I cross the Main,"
1802,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Somewhere ’twixt the Poles and Tropics
1803,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,I may find some brand new Topics
1804,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,For my food campaign!”
1805,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1806,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,So one Friday A. J. Skinner
1807,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Bought a passage and an “Inner”
1808,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,On a sailing ship;
1809,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Not for sport or relaxation,"
1810,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Not for rest or recreation--
1811,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,’Twas a business trip.
1812,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1813,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Fatal trip, had he but known it!"
1814,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Or a Fortune Teller shown it
1815,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Written on his palm!--
1816,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"How one morning bright and sunny,"
1817,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"With a breeze as soft as honey,"
1818,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,And a sea as calm--
1819,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1820,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Somewhere in the South Pacific
1821,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,There would spring up a terrific
1822,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Tropical typhoon--
1823,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Smite their helpless ship and bear it
1824,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,On a mountain wave and tear it
1825,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Like a Toy Balloon.
1826,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1827,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Luckily for Mr. Skinner,"
1828,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,When she sank he was not in her.
1829,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Clinging to a Spar,"
1830,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Being, too, an expert swimmer,"
1831,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Soon he saw the breakers’ glimmer
1832,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,On a sandy bar.
1833,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1834,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Lucky, did I say? Appalling"
1835,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Choice of words! Would you when crawling
1836,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Up a Sandbank gritty,"
1837,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"On firm land a foothold winning,"
1838,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Call it luck to meet a grinning
1839,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Cannibal Committee?
1840,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,
1841,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Well, to make a long narration"
1842,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,"Shorter (by abbreviation),"
1843,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Soon as he was sighted
1844,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Alcibiades J. Skinner
1845,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,To a most select Shore Dinner
1846,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Was at once invited.

1848,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Never had the South Pacific
1849,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Witnessed such a beatific

1851,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,Never was such mirth unbounded
1852,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,As when that far beach resounded
1853,ALCIBIADES J. SKINNER,With unwonted cheer.

1899,SIR IPPYKIN,Grim Giant Graft sate in his cavern dim;
1900,SIR IPPYKIN,A king’s reward was offered for him dead.
1901,SIR IPPYKIN,"He scowled to think it could not come to him,"
1902,SIR IPPYKIN,That price upon his head.
1903,SIR IPPYKIN,
1904,SIR IPPYKIN,"Of all his foes he dreaded only one,"
1905,SIR IPPYKIN,"A knight of stalwart heart and spotless fame,"
1906,SIR IPPYKIN,Who feared no creature underneath the sun--
1907,SIR IPPYKIN,Sir Ippykin his name.
1908,SIR IPPYKIN,
1909,SIR IPPYKIN,One night to Ippykin there came a thought--
1910,SIR IPPYKIN,"A mocking thought, that whispered in his ear:"
1911,SIR IPPYKIN,"“Ah, ha, Sir Knight! men say thou fearest naught;"
1912,SIR IPPYKIN,They lie--thou fearest Fear!
1913,SIR IPPYKIN,
1914,SIR IPPYKIN,“Fear smites you when you read the king’s decree
1915,SIR IPPYKIN,That whatsoever knight shall rid the land
1916,SIR IPPYKIN,"Of Giant Graft will gain a golden fee,"
1917,SIR IPPYKIN,Likewise his daughter’s hand.
1918,SIR IPPYKIN,
1919,SIR IPPYKIN,"“You fear to win, for fear that you must wed"
1920,SIR IPPYKIN,The princess--for you love another maid;
1921,SIR IPPYKIN,You dare not lose the fight because you dread
1922,SIR IPPYKIN,Lest men call you afraid.”
1923,SIR IPPYKIN,
1924,SIR IPPYKIN,"Cried Ippykin, “Lord, how shall I cut through"
1925,SIR IPPYKIN,This tangled coil?” Then of a sudden laughed
1926,SIR IPPYKIN,"A gleeful laugh, and rose and hied him to"
1927,SIR IPPYKIN,The cave of Giant Graft.
1928,SIR IPPYKIN,
1929,SIR IPPYKIN,No chronicler was present to reveal
1930,SIR IPPYKIN,What passed between the knight and Giant Graft;
1931,SIR IPPYKIN,Or what the bargain was the which to seal
1932,SIR IPPYKIN,So many horns they quaffed.
1933,SIR IPPYKIN,
1934,SIR IPPYKIN,But this is sure--thereafter from the lands
1935,SIR IPPYKIN,Of Ippykin once every week would stray
1936,SIR IPPYKIN,Certain fat sheep into the Giant’s hands
1937,SIR IPPYKIN,In some mysterious way;
1938,SIR IPPYKIN,
1939,SIR IPPYKIN,And once a week the giant and the knight
1940,SIR IPPYKIN,"Would chase each other round in seeming strife,"
1941,SIR IPPYKIN,"Until the king grew weary of the sight,"
1942,SIR IPPYKIN,And pensioned both for life.
1943,SIR IPPYKIN,
1944,SIR IPPYKIN,Then Ippykin and his true love were wed
1945,SIR IPPYKIN,And both lived happy till they passed away;
1946,SIR IPPYKIN,"But Giant Graft, fat, flagrant, and well fed,"
1947,SIR IPPYKIN,Is living to this day.

2525,THE SERIAL,I come from heaven knows where--or when.
2526,THE SERIAL,My pedigree is shady.
2527,THE SERIAL,My father was a Fountain Pen;
2528,THE SERIAL,"My mother, a Typelady,"
2529,THE SERIAL,
2530,THE SERIAL,Who smote the keys from morn till night
2531,THE SERIAL,"With fingers swift and taper,"
2532,THE SERIAL,"Till I appeared, all clean and bright,"
2533,THE SERIAL,On reams of foolscap paper.
2534,THE SERIAL,
2535,THE SERIAL,"And now in serial form I flow,"
2536,THE SERIAL,"And flout at style and diction,"
2537,THE SERIAL,As like a babbling brook I go
2538,THE SERIAL,To join the Sea of Fiction.
2539,THE SERIAL,
2540,THE SERIAL,"Some streams, I know, more deeply flow,"
2541,THE SERIAL,And some for speed endeavor.
2542,THE SERIAL,"Short stories come, short stories go,"
2543,THE SERIAL,But I’ll go on forever.
2544,THE SERIAL,
2545,THE SERIAL,I glitter like a foolish string
2546,THE SERIAL,"Of pearls, with polish painful,"
2547,THE SERIAL,With epigrams of doubtful ring
2548,THE SERIAL,And platitudes Hall-Caineful.
2549,THE SERIAL,
2550,THE SERIAL,"And many a mood and tense amiss,"
2551,THE SERIAL,"And metaphor amuddle,"
2552,THE SERIAL,"And here and there a clinging kiss,"
2553,THE SERIAL,And here and there a cuddle--
2554,THE SERIAL,
2555,THE SERIAL,"And here and there a phrase in French,"
2556,THE SERIAL,To give a touch linguisty;
2557,THE SERIAL,"And here and there a Fisher wench,"
2558,THE SERIAL,And here and there a Christy.
2559,THE SERIAL,
2560,THE SERIAL,And here and there and everywhere
2561,THE SERIAL,My thin stream slowly trickles
2562,THE SERIAL,’Twixt _Bunk’s Elixir for the Hair_
2563,THE SERIAL,And _Black and Croswell’s Pickles_.
2564,THE SERIAL,
2565,THE SERIAL,"And here a temperamental scene,"
2566,THE SERIAL,"Fervid, intense, Byronic--"
2567,THE SERIAL,Tosses tempestuous between
2568,THE SERIAL,_Ayre’s Soap and Tinkham’s Tonic_.
2569,THE SERIAL,
2570,THE SERIAL,A sprightly conversation’s flow
2571,THE SERIAL,Is checked by _Soak and Stingham’s
2572,THE SERIAL,"Pink Pills_, to reappear below"
2573,THE SERIAL,An ad for ladies’ thingums.
2574,THE SERIAL,
2575,THE SERIAL,The well-known slip ’twixt cup and lip
2576,THE SERIAL,"Here, too, finds confirmation--"
2577,THE SERIAL,“He raised his glass”--_Thy Anti-Grip!
2578,THE SERIAL,Beware of Imitations!_
2579,THE SERIAL,
2580,THE SERIAL,--“Up to his lips; when on his wrist
2581,THE SERIAL,"He felt a grip, steel-sinewed;"
2582,THE SERIAL,"The glass fell, and a hoarse voice hissed"
2583,THE SERIAL,The words”--_To be Continued_.

2597,THE CLOUD,
2598,THE CLOUD,_An Idyll of the Western Front_
2599,THE CLOUD,
2600,THE CLOUD,
2601,THE CLOUD,SCENE: _A wayside shrine in France_.
2602,THE CLOUD,
2603,THE CLOUD,"PERSONS: Celeste, Pierre, a Cloud."
2604,THE CLOUD,
2605,THE CLOUD,
2606,THE CLOUD,CELESTE (_gazing at the solitary white Cloud_):
2607,THE CLOUD,"I wonder what your thoughts are, little Cloud,"
2608,THE CLOUD,"Up in the sky, so lonely and so proud!"
2609,THE CLOUD,
2610,THE CLOUD,"CLOUD: Not proud, dear maiden; lonely, if you will."
2611,THE CLOUD,"Long have I watched you, sitting there so still"
2612,THE CLOUD,"Before that little shrine beside the way,"
2613,THE CLOUD,And wondered where your thoughts might be astray;
2614,THE CLOUD,"Your knitting lying idle on your knees,"
2615,THE CLOUD,"And worse than idle--like Penelope’s,"
2616,THE CLOUD,Working its own undoing!
2617,THE CLOUD,
2618,THE CLOUD,CELESTE (_picks up her knitting_): Who was she?
2619,THE CLOUD,Saints! What a knot!--Who was Penelope?
2620,THE CLOUD,"What happened to _her_ knitting? Tell me, Cloud!"
2621,THE CLOUD,
2622,THE CLOUD,CLOUD: She was a Queen; she wove her husband’s shroud.
2623,THE CLOUD,
2624,THE CLOUD,CELESTE (_drops the knitting_):
2625,THE CLOUD,His shroud!
2626,THE CLOUD,
2627,THE CLOUD,"CLOUD:     There, there! ’Twas only an excuse"
2628,THE CLOUD,"To put her lovers off, a wifely ruse,"
2629,THE CLOUD,"Bidding them bide till it was finished, she"
2630,THE CLOUD,Each night the web unravelled secretly.
2631,THE CLOUD,
2632,THE CLOUD,CELESTE: He came home safe?
2633,THE CLOUD,
2634,THE CLOUD,"CLOUD:                If I remember right,"
2635,THE CLOUD,It was the lovers needed shrouds that night!
2636,THE CLOUD,"It is an old, old tale. I heard it through"
2637,THE CLOUD,A Wind whose ancestor it was that blew
2638,THE CLOUD,Ulysses’ ship across the purple sea
2639,THE CLOUD,Back to his people and Penelope.
2640,THE CLOUD,"We Clouds pick up strange tales, as far and wide"
2641,THE CLOUD,"And to and fro above the world we ride,"
2642,THE CLOUD,"Across uncharted seas, upon the swell"
2643,THE CLOUD,"Of viewless waves and tides invisible,"
2644,THE CLOUD,"Freighted with friendly flood or forkèd flame,"
2645,THE CLOUD,Knowing not whither bound nor whence we came;
2646,THE CLOUD,"Now drifting lonely, now a company"
2647,THE CLOUD,Of pond’rous galleons--
2648,THE CLOUD,
2649,THE CLOUD,CELESTE:                Oft-times I see
2650,THE CLOUD,"A Cloud, as by some playful fancy stirred,"
2651,THE CLOUD,Take likeness of a monstrous beast or bird
2652,THE CLOUD,"Or some fantastic fish, as though ’twere clay"
2653,THE CLOUD,Moulded by unseen hands.
2654,THE CLOUD,
2655,THE CLOUD,"CLOUD:                   Then tell me, pray,"
2656,THE CLOUD,What I resemble now!
2657,THE CLOUD,
2658,THE CLOUD,CELESTE:             I scarcely know.
2659,THE CLOUD,"But had you asked a little while ago,"
2660,THE CLOUD,I should have said a camel; then your hump
2661,THE CLOUD,"Dissolved, and you became a gosling plump,"
2662,THE CLOUD,Downy and white and warm--
2663,THE CLOUD,
2664,THE CLOUD,"CLOUD:           What! _Warm_, up here?"
2665,THE CLOUD,Ten thousand feet above the earth!
2666,THE CLOUD,
2667,THE CLOUD,CELESTE:                           Oh dear!
2668,THE CLOUD,What am I thinking of! Of course I know
2669,THE CLOUD,How cold it is. Pierre has told me so
2670,THE CLOUD,A thousand times.
2671,THE CLOUD,
2672,THE CLOUD,CLOUD:            And who is this Pierre
2673,THE CLOUD,That tells you all the secrets of the air?
2674,THE CLOUD,How came he to such frigid heights to soar?
2675,THE CLOUD,
2676,THE CLOUD,CELESTE: Pierre’s my--He is in the Flying Corps.
2677,THE CLOUD,
2678,THE CLOUD,"CLOUD: Ah, now I understand! And he’s away?"
2679,THE CLOUD,
2680,THE CLOUD,"CELESTE: He left at dawn, where for he would not say,"
2681,THE CLOUD,Telling me only ’twas a bombing raid
2682,THE CLOUD,Somewhere--My God! What’s that?
2683,THE CLOUD,
2684,THE CLOUD,"CLOUD:                  What, little maid?"
2685,THE CLOUD,
2686,THE CLOUD,CELESTE (_pointing_): That--over there--beyond the
2687,THE CLOUD,wooded crest!
2688,THE CLOUD,
2689,THE CLOUD,CLOUD: Only a skylark dropping to her nest;
2690,THE CLOUD,Her mate is hov’ring somewhere near. I heard
2691,THE CLOUD,His tremulous song of love--
2692,THE CLOUD,
2693,THE CLOUD,CELESTE:                     That was no bird!
2694,THE CLOUD,(_Drops upon her knees._)
2695,THE CLOUD,O Mary! Blessed Mother! Hear my prayer!
2696,THE CLOUD,That one that fell--grant it was not Pierre!
2697,THE CLOUD,Here is the cross my mother gave me--I
2698,THE CLOUD,Will burn the longest candle it will buy!
2699,THE CLOUD,
2700,THE CLOUD,"CLOUD: Courage, my child! Your prayer will not be vain!"
2701,THE CLOUD,"Who guards the lark, will guide your lover’s plane."
2702,THE CLOUD,The West Wind’s calling. I must go!--Hark! There
2703,THE CLOUD,"He sings again! _Le bon Dieu garde, ma chère!_"

2707,II,
2708,II,PIERRE: I made a perfect landing over there
2709,II,Behind the church--
2710,II,
2711,II,CELESTE:            The Virgin heard my prayer!
2712,II,Now I must burn the candle that I vowed--
2713,II,
2714,II,PIERRE: Then ’twas our Blessed Lady sent that Cloud
2715,II,That saved me when the Boche came up behind.
2716,II,"I made a lightning turn, only to find"
2717,II,The Boche on top of me. It seemed a kind
2718,II,Of miracle to see that Cloud--I swear
2719,II,A moment past the sky was everywhere
2720,II,As clear as clear; there was no Cloud in sight.
2721,II,"It looked to me, floating there calm and white."
2722,II,"Like a great mother hen, and I a chick."
2723,II,"She seemed to call me, and I scurried quick"
2724,II,"Behind her wing. That spoiled the Boche’s game,"
2725,II,And gave me time to turn and take good aim.
2726,II,"I emptied my last drum, and saw him drop"
2727,II,Ten thousand feet in flames--
2728,II,
2729,II,"CELESTE (_shuddering_):       Stop! Pierre, stop!"
2730,II,Maybe a girl is waiting for him too--
2731,II,
2732,II,PIERRE: ’Twas either him or me--
2733,II,
2734,II,"CELESTE:                         Thank God, not you!"
2735,II,
2736,II,"PIERRE (_pointing to the church_): Come, let us burn"
2737,II,the candle that you vowed.
2738,II,
2739,II,CELESTE: Two candles!
2740,II,
2741,II,PIERRE:               Who’s the other for?
2742,II,
2743,II,CELESTE:                                   The Cloud!
