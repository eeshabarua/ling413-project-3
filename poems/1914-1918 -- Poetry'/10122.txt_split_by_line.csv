1626,IN THE WILDERNESS,Soft words of grace He spoke
1627,IN THE WILDERNESS,Unto lost desert-folk
1628,IN THE WILDERNESS,That listened wondering.
1629,IN THE WILDERNESS,He heard the bitterns call
1630,IN THE WILDERNESS,"From ruined palace-wall,"
1631,IN THE WILDERNESS,Answered them brotherly.
1632,IN THE WILDERNESS,He held communion
1633,IN THE WILDERNESS,With the she-pelican
1634,IN THE WILDERNESS,Of lonely piety.
1635,IN THE WILDERNESS,"Basilisk, cockatrice,"
1636,IN THE WILDERNESS,"Flocked to his homilies,"
1637,IN THE WILDERNESS,"With mail of dread device,"
1638,IN THE WILDERNESS,"With monstrous barbéd slings,"
1639,IN THE WILDERNESS,With eager dragon-eyes;
1640,IN THE WILDERNESS,Great rats on leather wings
1641,IN THE WILDERNESS,"And poor blind broken things,"
1642,IN THE WILDERNESS,Foul in their miseries.
1643,IN THE WILDERNESS,"And ever with Him went,"
1644,IN THE WILDERNESS,Of all His wanderings
1645,IN THE WILDERNESS,"Comrade, with ragged coat,"
1646,IN THE WILDERNESS,Gaunt ribs--poor innocent--
1647,IN THE WILDERNESS,"Bleeding foot, burning throat,"
1648,IN THE WILDERNESS,The guileless old scapegoat;
1649,IN THE WILDERNESS,For forty nights and days
1650,IN THE WILDERNESS,"Followed in Jesus' ways,"
1651,IN THE WILDERNESS,"Sure guard behind Him kept,"
1652,IN THE WILDERNESS,Tears like a lover wept.
