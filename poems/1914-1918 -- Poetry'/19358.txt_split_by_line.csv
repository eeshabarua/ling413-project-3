30,FOREWORD,"They have been printed as written, however, and, if they serve no other"
31,FOREWORD,"purpose, may at least help us to recall some things that too soon have"
32,FOREWORD,nearly passed out of our minds.

35,FOREWORD,"it and the rush of the British born to enlist, the early indifference of"

37,FOREWORD,"of 1914-15, the heartlessness of Germany, Canada stirred by the valor of"
38,FOREWORD,"her first battalions, recruiting general throughout the country, the"
39,FOREWORD,"slackness of the United States, financial and political profiteering in"
40,FOREWORD,"all countries, smaller European nations playing for position, Italy"
41,FOREWORD,"joining the Allies, the debacle of Russia, the awful casualty lists, the"
42,FOREWORD,"return of disabled soldiers, the ceaseless war work of our women, the"
43,FOREWORD,"United States at last declaring war on Germany, the final line up and"
44,FOREWORD,"defeat of the Hun, and the horror and apparent uselessness of it all;"
45,FOREWORD,some reflection of all these may be found by the reader in these simple
46,FOREWORD,rhymes.
