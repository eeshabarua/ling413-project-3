41,NOTE,_A Song of the Guns_ was written under what are probably the most
42,NOTE,remarkable conditions in which a poem has ever been composed.  The
43,NOTE,"author, who is now serving in Flanders, was present at the battle of"
44,NOTE,"Loos, and during a lull in the fighting--when the gunners, who had been"
45,NOTE,"sleepless for five nights, were resting like tired dogs under their"
46,NOTE,guns--he jotted down the main theme of the poem.  After the battle the
47,NOTE,"artillery brigade to which he was attached was ordered to Ypres, and it"
48,NOTE,"was during the long trench warfare in this district, within sight of the"
49,NOTE,"ruined tower of Ypres Cathedral, that the poem was finally completed."
50,NOTE,The last three stanzas were written at midnight in Brigade Headquarters
51,NOTE,with the German shells screaming over into the ruined town.

74,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"These are our masters, the slim"
75,A SONG OF THE GUNS,Grim muzzles that irk in the pit;
76,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"That chafe for the rushing of wheels,"
77,A SONG OF THE GUNS,For the teams plunging madly to bit
78,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"As the gunners wing down to unkey,"
79,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"For the trails sweeping half-circle-right,"
80,A SONG OF THE GUNS,For the six breech-blocks clashing as one
81,A SONG OF THE GUNS,To a target viewed clear on the sight--
82,A SONG OF THE GUNS,Gray masses the shells search and tear
83,A SONG OF THE GUNS,Into fragments that bunch as they run--
84,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"For the hour of the red battle-harvest,"
85,A SONG OF THE GUNS,The dream of the slaves of the gun!
86,A SONG OF THE GUNS,
87,A SONG OF THE GUNS,We have bartered our souls to the guns;
88,A SONG OF THE GUNS,Every fibre of body and brain
89,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"Have we trained to them, chained to them.  Serfs?"
90,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"Aye! but proud of the weight of our chain,"
91,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"Of our backs that are bowed to their workings,"
92,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"To hide them and guard and disguise,"
93,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"Of our ears that are deafened with service,"
94,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"Of hands that are scarred, and of eyes"
95,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"Grown hawklike with marking their prey,"
96,A SONG OF THE GUNS,Of wings that are slashed as with swords
97,A SONG OF THE GUNS,"When we hover, the turn of a blade"
98,A SONG OF THE GUNS,From the death that is sweet to our lords.

115,HEADQUARTERS,
116,HEADQUARTERS,
117,HEADQUARTERS,"A league and a league from the trenches,"
118,HEADQUARTERS,"from the traversed maze of the lines,--"
119,HEADQUARTERS,Where daylong the sniper watches and daylong the
120,HEADQUARTERS,"bullet whines,"
121,HEADQUARTERS,And the cratered earth is in travail with mines and
122,HEADQUARTERS,"with countermines,--"
123,HEADQUARTERS,
124,HEADQUARTERS,"Here, where haply some woman dreamed, (are"
125,HEADQUARTERS,those her roses that bloom
126,HEADQUARTERS,In the garden beyond the windows of my littered
127,HEADQUARTERS,working-room?)
128,HEADQUARTERS,We have decked the map for our masters as a bride
129,HEADQUARTERS,is decked for the groom.
130,HEADQUARTERS,
131,HEADQUARTERS,"Here, on each numbered lettered square,--cross-road"
132,HEADQUARTERS,"and mound and wire,"
133,HEADQUARTERS,"Loophole, redoubt, and emplacement, are the targets"
134,HEADQUARTERS,"their mouths desire,--"
135,HEADQUARTERS,"Gay with purples and browns and blues, have we"
136,HEADQUARTERS,traced them their arcs of fire.
137,HEADQUARTERS,
138,HEADQUARTERS,And ever the type-keys clatter; and ever our keen
139,HEADQUARTERS,wires bring
140,HEADQUARTERS,"Word from the watchers a-crouch below, word"
141,HEADQUARTERS,from the watchers a-wing;
142,HEADQUARTERS,And ever we hear the distant growl of our hid guns
143,HEADQUARTERS,thundering;
144,HEADQUARTERS,
145,HEADQUARTERS,"Hear it hardly, and turn again to our maps, where"
146,HEADQUARTERS,"the trench-lines crawl,"
147,HEADQUARTERS,Red on the gray and each with a sign for the
148,HEADQUARTERS,ranging shrapnel’s fall--
149,HEADQUARTERS,"Snakes that our masters shall scotch at dawn, as is"
150,HEADQUARTERS,written here on the wall.
151,HEADQUARTERS,
152,HEADQUARTERS,For the weeks of our waiting draw to a close....
153,HEADQUARTERS,There is scarcely a leaf astir
154,HEADQUARTERS,In the garden beyond my windows where the
155,HEADQUARTERS,twilight shadows blur
156,HEADQUARTERS,The blaze of some woman’s roses....

165,GUN-TEAMS,"Their rugs are sodden, their heads are down, their"
166,GUN-TEAMS,tails are turned to the storm.
167,GUN-TEAMS,"(Would you know them, you that groomed them"
168,GUN-TEAMS,"in the sleek fat days of peace,--"
169,GUN-TEAMS,When the tiles rang to their pawings in the lighted
170,GUN-TEAMS,"stalls and warm,--"
171,GUN-TEAMS,Now the foul clay cakes on breeching-strap and
172,GUN-TEAMS,clogs the quick-release?)
173,GUN-TEAMS,
174,GUN-TEAMS,"The blown rain stings, there is never a star, the"
175,GUN-TEAMS,tracks are rivers of slime.
176,GUN-TEAMS,(You must harness up by guesswork with a
177,GUN-TEAMS,"failing torch for light,"
178,GUN-TEAMS,"Instep-deep in unmade standings, for it’s active-service time,"
179,GUN-TEAMS,"And our resting weeks are over, and we move"
180,GUN-TEAMS,the guns to-night.)
181,GUN-TEAMS,
182,GUN-TEAMS,"The iron tires slither, the traces sag; their blind"
183,GUN-TEAMS,hooves stumble and slide;
184,GUN-TEAMS,"They are war-worn, they are weary, soaked with"
185,GUN-TEAMS,sweat and sopped with rain.
186,GUN-TEAMS,"(You must hold them, you must help them, swing"
187,GUN-TEAMS,your lead and centre wide
188,GUN-TEAMS,Where the greasy granite pave peters out to
189,GUN-TEAMS,squelching drain.)
190,GUN-TEAMS,
191,GUN-TEAMS,There is shrapnel bursting a mile in front on the
192,GUN-TEAMS,road that the guns must take:
193,GUN-TEAMS,"(You are nervous, you are thoughtful, you are"
194,GUN-TEAMS,"shifting in your seat,"
195,GUN-TEAMS,As you watch the ragged feathers flicker orange
196,GUN-TEAMS,flame and break)--
197,GUN-TEAMS,But the teams are pulling steady down the
198,GUN-TEAMS,battered village street.
199,GUN-TEAMS,
200,GUN-TEAMS,"You have shod them cold, and their coats are long,"
201,GUN-TEAMS,and their bellies gray with the mud;
202,GUN-TEAMS,"They have done with gloss and polish, but the"
203,GUN-TEAMS,fighting heart’s unbroke.
204,GUN-TEAMS,"We, who saw them hobbling after us down white"
205,GUN-TEAMS,"roads flecked with blood,"
206,GUN-TEAMS,"Patient, wondering why we left them, till we"
207,GUN-TEAMS,lost them in the smoke;
208,GUN-TEAMS,
209,GUN-TEAMS,"Who have felt them shiver between our knees,"
210,GUN-TEAMS,"when the shells rain black from the skies,"
211,GUN-TEAMS,When the bursting terrors find us and the lines
212,GUN-TEAMS,stampede as one;
213,GUN-TEAMS,Who have watched the pierced limbs quiver and
214,GUN-TEAMS,"the pain in stricken eyes,"
215,GUN-TEAMS,"Know the worth of humble servants, foolish-faithful"
216,GUN-TEAMS,to their gun!

225,EYES IN THE AIR,And there’s never a cloud to blind us from the haunts of
226,EYES IN THE AIR,our lurking foe--
227,EYES IN THE AIR,"Sunk pit whence his shrapnel tore us, support-trench"
228,EYES IN THE AIR,"crest-concealed,"
229,EYES IN THE AIR,"As clear as the charts before us, his ramparts lie revealed."
230,EYES IN THE AIR,"His panicked watchers spy us, a droning threat in the void;"
231,EYES IN THE AIR,"Their whistling shells outfly us--puff upon puff, deployed"
232,EYES IN THE AIR,"Across the green beneath us, across the flanking grey,"
233,EYES IN THE AIR,In fume and fire to sheathe us and balk us of our prey.
234,EYES IN THE AIR,

240,EYES IN THE AIR,The hawks that guide the gun!
241,EYES IN THE AIR,
242,EYES IN THE AIR,"No word from earth may reach us save, white against the ground,"
243,EYES IN THE AIR,The strips outspread to teach us whose ears are deaf to sound:
244,EYES IN THE AIR,"But down the winds that sear us, athwart our engine’s shriek,"
245,EYES IN THE AIR,"We send--and know they hear us, the ranging guns we speak."
246,EYES IN THE AIR,"Our visored eyeballs show us their answering pennant, broke"
247,EYES IN THE AIR,"Eight thousand feet below us, a whirl of flame-stabbed smoke--"
248,EYES IN THE AIR,"The burst that hangs to guide us, while numbed gloved fingers"
249,EYES IN THE AIR,tap
250,EYES IN THE AIR,From wireless key beside us the circles of the map.
251,EYES IN THE AIR,
252,EYES IN THE AIR,Line--target--short or over--
253,EYES IN THE AIR,"Comes, plain as clock-hands run,"
254,EYES IN THE AIR,"Word from the birds that hover,"
255,EYES IN THE AIR,"Unblinded, tail to sun--"
256,EYES IN THE AIR,"Word out of air to range them fair,"
257,EYES IN THE AIR,From hawks that guide the gun!
258,EYES IN THE AIR,
259,EYES IN THE AIR,"Your flying shells have failed you, your landward guns are dumb:"
260,EYES IN THE AIR,"Since earth hath naught availed you, these skies be open!  Come,"
261,EYES IN THE AIR,"Where, wild to meet and mate you, flame in their beaks for"
262,EYES IN THE AIR,"breath,"
263,EYES IN THE AIR,Black doves! the white hawks wait you on the wind-tossed
264,EYES IN THE AIR,boughs of death.
265,EYES IN THE AIR,"These boughs be cold without you, our hearts are hot for this,"
266,EYES IN THE AIR,"Our wings shall beat about you, our scorching breath shall kiss:"
267,EYES IN THE AIR,"Till, fraught with that we gave you, fulfilled of our desire,"
268,EYES IN THE AIR,"You bank,--too late to save you from biting beaks of fire,--"
269,EYES IN THE AIR,
270,EYES IN THE AIR,"Turn sideways from your lover,"
271,EYES IN THE AIR,"Shudder and swerve and run,"
272,EYES IN THE AIR,Tilt; stagger; and plunge over
273,EYES IN THE AIR,"Ablaze against the sun,--"
274,EYES IN THE AIR,"Doves dead in air, who clomb to dare"
275,EYES IN THE AIR,The hawks that guide the gun!

292,SIGNALS,"On his ear that listens, listens;"

296,SIGNALS,
297,SIGNALS,"Wires from the earth, from the air;"
298,SIGNALS,Wires that whisper and chatter

301,SIGNALS,"Wires that are never at rest,--"
302,SIGNALS,"For the linesmen tap them and test,"
303,SIGNALS,And ever they tremble with tone:--
304,SIGNALS,"And he knows from a hundred signals the buzzing call of his own,"
305,SIGNALS,"The breaks and the vibrant stresses,--"
306,SIGNALS,The Z and the G and the S’s
307,SIGNALS,That call his hand to the answering key and his mouth to the

309,SIGNALS,
310,SIGNALS,For always the laid guns fret
311,SIGNALS,"On the words that his mouth shall utter,"
312,SIGNALS,When rifle and Maxim stutter
313,SIGNALS,And the rockets volley to starward from the spurting parapet;
314,SIGNALS,And always his ear must hark
315,SIGNALS,"To the voices out of the dark,--"
316,SIGNALS,"For the whisper over the wire,"
317,SIGNALS,From the bombed and the battered trenches where the wounded moan
318,SIGNALS,"in the mire,--"
319,SIGNALS,For a sign to waken the thunder
320,SIGNALS,Which shatters the night in sunder
321,SIGNALS,With the flash of the leaping muzzles and the beat of
322,SIGNALS,battery-fire.

411,AMMUNITION COLUMN,There’s a lone mule braying against the line where

413,AMMUNITION COLUMN,There’s a lone soul humming a hint of a song in
