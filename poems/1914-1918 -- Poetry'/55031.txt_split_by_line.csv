104,PREFACE,
105,PREFACE,This miscellaneous volume is composed of three sections. The first
106,PREFACE,"twelve poems were written in 1913, and printed privately by Mr. Hornby"
107,PREFACE,in 1914.
108,PREFACE,
109,PREFACE,"The last of these poems proved to be a “war poem,” and on that follow"
110,PREFACE,"eighteen pieces which were called forth on occasion during the War, the"
111,PREFACE,last being a broadsheet on the surrender of the German ships. All of
112,PREFACE,these verses appeared in some journal or serial. There were a few
113,PREFACE,"others, but they are not included in this collection, either because"
114,PREFACE,"they are lost, or because they show decidedly inferior claims to"
115,PREFACE,salvage.
116,PREFACE,
117,PREFACE,The last six poems or sonnets are of various dates.

1689,NOTES,POEM 3.--As the metre or scansion of this poem was publicly discussed
1690,NOTES,"and wrongly analysed by some who admired its effects, it may be well to"
1691,NOTES,"explain that it and the three other poems in similar measure, “Flowering"
1692,NOTES,"Tree,” “In der Fremde,” “The West Front,” are strictly syllabic verse on"
1693,NOTES,"the model left by Milton in “Samson Agonistes”; except that his system,"
1694,NOTES,"which depended on exclusion of extra-metrical syllables (that is,"
1695,NOTES,syllables which did not admit of resolution by “elision” into a
1696,NOTES,"disyllabic scheme) from all places but the last, still admitted them in"
1697,NOTES,"that place, thereby forbidding inversion of the last foot. It is natural"
1698,NOTES,"to conclude that, had he pursued his inventions, his next step would"
1699,NOTES,"have been to get rid of this anomaly; and if that is done, the result is"
1700,NOTES,the new rhythms that these poems exhibit. In this sort of prosody rhyme
1701,NOTES,"is admitted, like alliteration, as an ornament at will; it is not"
1702,NOTES,needed. My four experiments are confined to the twelve-syllable verse.
1703,NOTES,It is probably agreed that there are possibilities in that long six-foot
1704,NOTES,line which English poetry has not fully explored.
1705,NOTES,
1706,NOTES,"POEM 12, “Hell and Hate.""--This poem was written December 16, 1913. It"
1707,NOTES,is the description of a little picture hanging in my bedroom; it had
1708,NOTES,"been painted for me as a New Year’s gift more than thirty years before,"
1709,NOTES,and I described it partly because I never exactly knew what it meant.
1710,NOTES,"When the war broke out I remembered my poem and sent it to _The Times_,"
1711,NOTES,"where it appeared in the Literary Supplement September 24, 1914."

1713,NOTES,"POEM 13, “Wake up, England!""--This motto is the King’s well-known call"
1714,NOTES,to the country in 1901 at the Guildhall.
1715,NOTES,
1716,NOTES,"The verses appeared in _The Times_ on August 8, 1914. There were three"
1717,NOTES,"other stanzas, which are better omitted; and the last two lines, which"
1718,NOTES,"were printed in capitals and ran thus,"
1719,NOTES,
1720,NOTES,"England stands for honour,"
1721,NOTES,"May God defend the right,"
1722,NOTES,
1723,NOTES,were purposely set out of metre. In the second stanza the words “The
1724,NOTES,"fiend” are what I originally wrote, and I think that the friends who"
1725,NOTES,persuaded me to substitute “Thy foe” will no longer wish to protest.
