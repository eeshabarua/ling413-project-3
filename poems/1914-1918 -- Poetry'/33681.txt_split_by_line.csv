526,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Venus, that brushes with her shining lips"
527,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,(Surely!) the wakeful edge of the world and mocks

529,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Or the large moon (pricked by the spars of ships
530,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Creeping and creeping in their restlessness),"
531,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The moon pouring strange light on things more strange,"
532,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Looks she unheedfully on seas and lands
533,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Trembling with change and fear of counterchange?
534,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
535,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"O, not earth trembles, but the stars, the stars!"
536,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The sky is shaken and the cool air is quivering.
537,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,I cannot look up to the crowded height
538,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"And see the fair stars trembling in their light,"
539,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,For thinking of the starlike spirits of men
540,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Crowding the earth and with great passion quivering:--
541,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Stars quenched in anger and hate, stars sick with pity."
542,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,I cannot look up to the naked skies
543,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Because a sorrow on dark midnight lies,"
544,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Death, on the living world of sense;"
545,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Because on my own land a shadow lies

548,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Streams of uncomprehending sadness pour,"
549,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Thwarting the eager spirit's pure intelligence....
550,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,How look (I muse) those cold and solitary stars
551,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"On these magnificent, cruel wars?"
552,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
553,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Stars trembled in broad heaven, faint with pity."
554,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,An hour to dawn I looked. Beside the trees
555,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Wet mist shaped other trees that branching rose,"
556,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Covering the woods and putting out the stars.
557,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"There was no murmur on the seas,"
558,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,No wind blew--only the wandering air that grows
559,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"With dawn, then murmurs, sighs,"
560,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And dies.
561,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The mist climbed slowly, putting out the stars,"
562,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And the earth trembled when the stars were gone;
563,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And moving strangely everywhere upon
564,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The trembling earth, thickened the watery mist."
565,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
566,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And for a time the holy things are veiled.
567,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,England's wise thoughts are swords; her quiet hours
568,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Are trodden underfoot like wayside flowers,"
569,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And every English heart is England's wholly.
570,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,In starless night
571,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,A serious passion streams the heaven with light.
572,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,A common beating is in the air--
573,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The heart of England throbbing everywhere.
574,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"And all her roads are nerves of noble thought,"
575,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And all her people's brain is but her brain;
576,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And all her history (less her shame)
577,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Is part of her requickened consciousness.
578,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Her courage rises clean again;
579,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Her children's inspiration is her name, her name!"
580,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
581,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Even in victory there hides defeat;
582,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The spirit's murdered though the body survives,"
583,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Except the cause for which a people strives
584,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Burn with no covetous, foul heat;"
585,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Fights she against herself who infamously draws
586,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The sword against man's secret spiritual laws.
587,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"But thou, England, because a bitter heel"
588,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Hath sought to bruise the brain, the sensitive will,"
589,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The conscience of the world,"
590,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"For this, England, art risen, and shalt fight"
591,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Purely through long profoundest night,"
592,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Making their quarrel thine who are grieved like thee;
593,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And (if to thee the stars yield victory)
594,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Tempering their hate of the great foe, that hurled"
595,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Vainly her strength against the conscience of the world,"
596,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Though all their dead be countless as the stars,"
597,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And all the living bitter as the sea.
598,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
599,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"I looked again, or dreamed I looked, and saw"
600,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The stars again and all their peace again.
601,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The moving mist had gone, and shining still"
602,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The moon went high and pale above the hill.
603,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Not now those lights were trembling in the vast
604,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Ways of the nervy heaven, nor trembled earth:"
605,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Profound and calm they gazed as the soft-shod hours passed.
606,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"And with less fear (not with less awe,"
607,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Remembering, England, all the blood and pain),"
608,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"How look, I cried, ye stern and solitary stars"
609,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,On these disastrous wars!
