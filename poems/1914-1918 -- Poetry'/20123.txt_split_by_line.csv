84,NOTE,The only reason for printing this little book is that many people have
85,NOTE,"expressed a desire to have the memorial poem, ""Golden Stars,"" in a"
86,NOTE,permanent form.
87,NOTE,
88,NOTE,The other verses are included simply because they are a wayside record
89,NOTE,of some of the varied feelings of an old lover of peace who was willing

475,AMERICA'S WELCOME HOME,And many a valiant lad was proud to seal it with his life.
476,AMERICA'S WELCOME HOME,
477,AMERICA'S WELCOME HOME,"Oh, welcome home in Heaven's peace, dear spirits of the dead!"
478,AMERICA'S WELCOME HOME,And welcome home ye living sons America hath bred!

542,I,"Through all America's domain,"
543,I,"A willing, grey-haired servitor"
544,I,Bearing the Fiery Cross of righteous war.
545,I,"And everywhere, on mountain, vale and plain,"
546,I,"In crowded street and lonely cottage door,"
547,I,I saw the symbol of the bright blue star.
548,I,"Millions of stars! Rejoice, dear land, rejoice"

558,II,"High-hearted, keen, with laughter and with song,"
559,II,"Fearless of lurking danger on the sea,"
560,II,Eager to fight in Flanders or in France
561,II,"Against the monstrous German wrong,"
562,II,And sure of victory!
563,II,Brothers in soul with British and with French
564,II,They held their ground in many a bloody trench;
565,II,And when the swift word came--
566,II,_Advance!_
567,II,"Over the top they went through waves of flame,--"
568,II,"Confident, reckless, irresistible,"
569,II,"Real Americans,--"
570,II,Their rush was never stayed
