51,PREFACE,
52,PREFACE,"Most of these poems were written at the Front, and appeared in the"
53,PREFACE,_Fifth Gloucester Gazette_--the first paper ever published from the
54,PREFACE,trenches.
55,PREFACE,
56,PREFACE,The author was then a Lance-Corporal in the 5th Battalion of the
57,PREFACE,"Gloucestershire Regiment, and as such gained the Distinguished Conduct"
58,PREFACE,"Medal in August, 1915."
59,PREFACE,
60,PREFACE,The award appears as follows in the _London Gazette_--
61,PREFACE,
62,PREFACE,F. W. HARVEY.--“For conspicuous gallantry on the night of the 3rd-4th
63,PREFACE,"August, 1915, near Hebuterne, when, with a patrol, he and another"
64,PREFACE,Non-Commissioned Officer went out to reconnoitre in the direction
65,PREFACE,of a suspected listening post. In advancing they encountered the
66,PREFACE,hostile post evidently covering a working party in the rear. Corporal
67,PREFACE,"Knight at once shot one of the enemy, and, with Lance-Corporal"
68,PREFACE,"Harvey, rushed the post, shooting two others, and assistance arriving"
69,PREFACE,"the enemy fled. Lance-Corporal Harvey pursued, felling one of the"
70,PREFACE,"retreating Germans with a bludgeon. He seized him, but finding his"
71,PREFACE,"revolver empty and the enemy having opened fire, he was called back"
72,PREFACE,"by Corporal Knight, and the prisoner escaped. Three Germans were"
73,PREFACE,killed and their rifles and a Mauser pistol were brought in. The
74,PREFACE,patrol had no loss.”
75,PREFACE,
76,PREFACE,The poems are written by a soldier and reflect a soldier’s outlook.
77,PREFACE,"Mud, blood and khaki are rather conspicuously absent. They are, in"
78,PREFACE,"fact, the last things a soldier wishes to think or talk about."
79,PREFACE,
80,PREFACE,What he does think of is his home.
81,PREFACE,
82,PREFACE,"Bishop Frodsham, preaching in Gloucester Cathedral, after visiting"
83,PREFACE,"the Troops in France, quoted the following poem in a passage which"
84,PREFACE,admirably expresses the feelings of most of our fighting men.
85,PREFACE,
86,PREFACE,“To suppose that these men enjoy the fighting would be sheer nonsense.
87,PREFACE,The soldier does not want to go on killing and maiming Germans or
88,PREFACE,"Turks. He wants to get the dreadful war finished, so that he can get"
89,PREFACE,back to England again. But he wants the matter fought to a finish
90,PREFACE,because he has seen in the villages and towns of France what German
91,PREFACE,"domination means. It has made him think furiously, as the French say."
92,PREFACE,Many regiments and ships’ companies while away the impracticable hours
93,PREFACE,by publishing little newspapers.
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,“The _Fifth Gloucester Gazette_ is one of these journals. We are proud
96,PREFACE,of the courage and the gaiety these little papers show. We laugh at
97,PREFACE,their quips and jokes: then suddenly we find that the corners of our
98,PREFACE,mouths are quivering and the tears are gathering in our eyes. We see
99,PREFACE,that the boys are thinking about England below their gaiety. One young
100,PREFACE,poet lifts the veil in this exquisite little rondeau--
101,PREFACE,
102,PREFACE,"“‘If we return, will England be"
103,PREFACE,Just England still to you and me--
104,PREFACE,The place where we must earn our bread?
105,PREFACE,"We who have walked among the dead,"
106,PREFACE,"And watched the smile of agony,"
107,PREFACE,"And seen the price of liberty,"
108,PREFACE,Which we have taken carelessly
109,PREFACE,"From other hands. Nay, we shall dread:"
110,PREFACE,"If we return,"
111,PREFACE,Dread lest we hold blood-guiltily
112,PREFACE,The thing that men have died to free.
113,PREFACE,Our English fields shall blossom red
114,PREFACE,"In all the blood that has been shed,"
115,PREFACE,"By men whose guardians are we,"
116,PREFACE,If we return.’”
117,PREFACE,
118,PREFACE,That is perhaps the keynote of a book which the author has dedicated to
119,PREFACE,all dead and living comrades who have loved England.

1219,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1220,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,(_To A. E. S._)
1221,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1222,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1223,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,We laid you fast in frozen clay
1224,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,When Winter had enchained the land.
1225,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"(Lad, was it but three weeks to-day?)"
1226,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,And now comes Springtime’s messenger with golden tidings in his hand.
1227,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1228,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"A mist blows off the thawing earth,"
1229,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"And drips from every budding tree,"
1230,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"The springs are loosed, and mad with mirth"
1231,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"Run lisping in the fallen leaves, or laughing in the sunlight free."
1232,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1233,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"Oh you who loved the song so well,"
1234,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,Do you not hear the throstle’s note?
1235,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,Nor heed the lovesome light that fell
1236,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"As warm five thousand years ago, when Solomon, the wise king, wrote?"
1237,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1238,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"“Sweet,” wrote he. Yes, the light is sweet!"
1239,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,And maddening sweet to walk in Spring:
1240,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,Yet is the pleasure incomplete--
1241,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,How should the living understand the melodies that dead throats sing?
1242,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1243,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,Thinker and poet clutch in vain
1244,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"The secret of a laughing rill,"
1245,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,And Shakespeare’s self could never gain
1246,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,The message blown so mockingly by trumpet of a daffodil.
1247,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1248,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"Dear lad, for you I will not call,"
1249,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,Nor let a foolish dread be born.
1250,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,A thousand years is still too small
1251,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"To learn the secrets you must learn, ere you arise on Doomsday morn."
1252,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1253,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,For you have set your ear to earth
1254,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,To list the growing of the flowers:
1255,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,And catch the strains of Death and Birth:
1256,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,And take the honey that is stored by all the flitting bee-like hours.
1257,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1258,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,And you must put to memory
1259,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,The silver music of the stars
1260,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"That raineth down so silently,"
1261,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,And all the mighty harmony scrolled on the sky in glittering bars.
1262,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1263,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"The music that no man can make,"
1264,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"The colours that he cannot see,"
1265,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,These out of darkness you shall take
1266,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,And nourish up your growing soul with manna of their mystery.
1267,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
1268,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,And then when you awake again
1269,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"(And I have slept a little too),"
1270,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,How we shall rise to pace anew
1271,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"An earth--where every dream is true, and nothing is unknown but pain."
