107,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","IN MEMORIAM, A.H."
108,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
109,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","(_Auberon Herbert, Captain Lord Lucas, R.F.C.; killed November 3,"
110,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",1916._)
111,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
112,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Νωμᾶται δ’έν ἀτρυγέτῳ χάει
113,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
114,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
115,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",The wind had blown away the rain
116,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",That all day long had soaked the level plain.
117,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Against the horizon’s fiery wrack,"
118,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",The sheds loomed black.
119,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And higher, in their tumultuous concourse met,"
120,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","The streaming clouds, shot-riddled banners, wet"
121,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","With the flickering storm,"
122,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Drifted and smouldered, warm"
123,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",With flashes sent
124,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",From the lower firmament.
125,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And they concealed--
126,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",They only here and there through rifts revealed
127,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","A hidden sanctuary of fire and light,"
128,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",A city of chrysolite.
129,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
130,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","We looked and laughed and wondered, and I said:"
131,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","That orange sea, those oriflammes outspread"
132,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Were like the fanciful imaginings
133,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",That the young painter flings
134,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Upon the canvas bold,"
135,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Such as the sage and the old
136,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Make mock at, saying it could never be"
137,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And you assented also, laughingly."
138,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","I wondered what they meant,"
139,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","That flaming firmament,"
140,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Those clouds so grey so gold, so wet so warm,"
141,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","So much of glory and so much of storm,"
142,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","The end of the world, or the end"
143,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Of the war--remoter still to me and you, my friend."
144,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
145,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Alas! it meant not this, it meant not that:"
146,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",It meant that now the last time you and I
147,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Should look at the golden sky,"
148,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And the dark fields large and flat,"
149,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And smell the evening weather,"
150,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And laugh and talk and wonder both together.
151,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
152,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","The last, last time. We nevermore should meet"
153,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","In France or London street,"
154,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Or fields of home. The desolated space
155,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Of life shall nevermore
156,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Be what it was before.
157,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",No one shall take your place.
158,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",No other face
159,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Can fill that empty frame.
160,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",There is no answer when we call your name.
161,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",We cannot hear your step upon the stair.
162,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",We turn to speak and find a vacant chair.
163,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Something is broken which we cannot mend.
164,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",God has done more than take away a friend
165,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",In taking you; for all that we have left
166,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Is bruised and irremediably bereft.
167,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",There is none like you. Yet not that alone
168,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Do we bemoan;
169,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","But this; that you were greater than the rest,"
170,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And better than the best.
171,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
172,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","O liberal heart fast-rooted to the soil,"
173,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","O lover of ancient freedom and proud toil,"
174,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Friend of the gipsies and all wandering song,"
175,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",The forest’s nursling and the favoured child
176,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Of woodlands wild--
177,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","O brother to the birds and all things free,"
178,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Captain of liberty!
179,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Deep in your heart the restless seed was sown;
180,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",The vagrant spirit fretted in your feet;
181,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","We wondered could you tarry long,"
182,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And brook for long the cramping street,"
183,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Or would you one day sail for shores unknown,"
184,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And shake from you the dust of towns, and spurn"
185,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",The crowded market-place--and not return?
186,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",You found a sterner guide;
187,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","You heard the guns. Then, to their distant fire,"
188,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Your dreams were laid aside;
189,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And on that day, you cast your heart’s desire"
190,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Upon a burning pyre;
191,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","You gave your service to the exalted need,"
192,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Until at last from bondage freed,"
193,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","At liberty to serve as you loved best,"
194,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",You chose the noblest way. God did the rest.
195,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
196,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","So when the spring of the world shall shrive our stain,"
197,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","After the winter of war,"
198,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","When the poor world awakes to peace once more,"
199,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","After such night of ravage and of rain,"
200,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",You shall not come again.
201,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","You shall not come to taste the old Spring weather,"
202,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","To gallop through the soft untrampled heather,"
203,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",To bathe and bake your body on the grass.
204,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","We shall be there, alas!"
205,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","But not with you. When Spring shall wake the earth,"
206,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And quicken the scarred fields to the new birth,"
207,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Our grief shall grow. For what can Spring renew
208,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",More fiercely for us than the need of you?
209,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
210,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",That night I dreamt they sent for me and said
211,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","That you were missing, “missing, missing--dead”:"
212,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","I cried when in the morning I awoke,"
213,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And all the world seemed shrouded in a cloak;
214,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","But when I saw the sun,"
215,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And knew another day had just begun,"
216,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","I brushed the dream away, and quite forgot"
217,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",The nightmare’s ugly blot.
218,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",So was the dream forgot. The dream came true.
219,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Before the night I knew
220,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",That you had flown away into the air
221,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Forever. Then I cheated my despair.
222,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",I said
223,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",That you were safe--or wounded--but not dead.
224,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Alas! I knew
225,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Which was the false and true.
226,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
227,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And after days of watching, days of lead,"
228,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",There came the certain news that you were dead
229,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","You had died fighting, fighting against odds,"
230,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Such as in war the gods
231,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Æthereal dared when all the world was young;
232,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Such fighting as blind Homer never sung,"
233,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Nor Hector nor Achilles never knew;
234,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",High in the empty blue.
235,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
236,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","High, high, above the clouds, against the setting sun,"
237,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","The fight was fought, and your great task was done."
238,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
239,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Of all your brave adventures this the last
240,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",The bravest was and best;
241,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Meet ending to a long embattled past,"
242,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","This swift, triumphant, fatal quest,"
243,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Crowned with the wreath that never perisheth,"
244,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And diadem of honourable death;
245,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Swift Death aflame with offering supreme
246,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And mighty sacrifice,"
247,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",More than all mortal dream;
248,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","A soaring death, and near to Heaven’s gate;"
249,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Beneath the very walls of Paradise.
250,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Surely with soul elate,"
251,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","You heard the destined bullet as you flew,"
252,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And surely your prophetic spirit knew
253,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",That you had well deserved that shining fate.
254,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
255,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Here is no waste,"
256,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","No burning Might-have-been,"
257,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","No bitter after-taste,"
258,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","None to censure, none to screen,"
259,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Nothing awry, nor anything misspent;"
260,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Only content, content beyond content,"
261,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Which hath not any room for betterment.
262,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
263,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","God, Who had made you valiant, strong and swift,"
264,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And maimed you with a bullet long ago,"
265,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And cleft your riotous ardour with a rift,"
266,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And checked your youth’s tumultuous overflow,"
267,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Gave back your youth to you,"
268,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And packed in moments rare and few
269,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Achievements manifold
270,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And happiness untold,"
271,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And bade you spring to Death as to a bride,"
272,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","In manhood’s ripeness, power and pride,"
273,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And on your sandals the strong wings of youth.
274,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",He let you leave a name
275,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","To shine on the entablatures of truth,"
276,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Forever:
277,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",To sound forever in answering halls of fame.
278,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
279,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",For you soared onwards to that world which rags
280,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Of clouds, like tattered flags,"
281,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Concealed; you reached the walls of chrysolite,"
282,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",The mansions white;
283,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And losing all, you gained the civic crown"
284,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Of that eternal town,"
285,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Wherein you passed a rightful citizen
286,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Of the bright commonwealth ablaze beyond our ken.
287,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
288,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Surely you found companions meet for you
289,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",In that high place;
290,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",You met there face to face
291,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Those you had never known, but whom you knew;"
292,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Knights of the Table Round,"
293,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And all the very brave, the very true,"
294,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",With chivalry crowned;
295,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","The captains rare,"
296,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Courteous and brave beyond our human air;
297,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Those who had loved and suffered overmuch,"
298,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Now free from the world’s touch.
299,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And with them were the friends of yesterday,"
300,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Who went before and pointed you the way;
301,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And in that place of freshness, light and rest,"
302,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
303,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Where Lancelot and Tristram vigil keep
304,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Over their King’s long sleep,"
305,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Surely they made a place for you,"
306,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Their long-expected guest,"
307,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Among the chosen few,"
308,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And welcomed you, their brother and their friend,"
309,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",To that companionship which hath no end.
310,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",
311,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And in the portals of the sacred hall
312,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","You hear the trumpet’s call,"
313,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","At dawn upon the silvery battlement,"
314,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Re-echo through the deep
315,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And bid the sons of God to rise from sleep,"
316,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And with a shout to hail
317,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",The sunrise on the city of the Grail:
318,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",The music that proud Lucifer in Hell
319,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",Missed more than all the joys that he forwent.
320,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",You hear the solemn bell
321,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","At vespers, when the oriflammes are furled;"
322,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","And then you know that somewhere in the world,"
323,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","That shines far-off beneath you like a gem,"
324,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","They think of you, and when you think of them"
325,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","You know that they will wipe away their tears,"
326,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And cast aside their fears;
327,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","That they will have it so,"
328,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",And in no otherwise;
329,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","That it is well with them because they know,"
330,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","With faithful eyes,"
331,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Fixed forward and turned upwards to the skies,"
332,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","That it is well with you,"
333,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Among the chosen few,"
334,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.","Among the very brave, the very true."
335,"IN MEMORIAM, A.H.",

340,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",
341,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",_To J. C. S._
342,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",
343,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",
344,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","The snows have fled, the hail, the lashing rain,"
345,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Before the Spring.
346,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","The grass is starred with buttercups again,"
347,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",The blackbirds sing.
348,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",
349,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Now spreads the month that feast of lovely things
350,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",We loved of old.
351,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Once more the swallow glides with darkling wings
352,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Against the gold.
353,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",
354,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Now the brown bees about the peach trees boom
355,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Upon the walls;
356,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",And far away beyond the orchard’s bloom
357,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",The cuckoo calls.
358,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",
359,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","The season holds a festival of light,"
360,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","For you, for me,"
361,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","The shadows are abroad, there falls a blight"
362,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",On each green tree.
363,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",
364,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","And every leaf unfolding, every flower"
365,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Brings bitter meed;
366,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Beauty of the morning and the evening hour
367,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Quickens our need.
368,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",
369,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","All is reborn, but never any Spring"
370,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Can bring back this;
371,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Nor any fullness of midsummer bring
372,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",The voice we miss.
373,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",
374,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",The smiling eyes shall smile on us no more;
375,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","The laughter clear,"
376,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","Too far away on the forbidden shore,"
377,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",We shall not hear.
378,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",
379,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","Bereft of these until the day we die,"
380,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",We both must dwell;
381,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","Alone, alone, and haunted by the cry:"
382,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",“Hail and farewell!”
383,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",
384,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Yet when the scythe of Death shall near us hiss
385,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917","Through the cold air,"
386,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",Then on the shuddering marge of the abyss
387,"DIFFUGERE NIVES, 1917",They will be there.

850,THE WOUNDED,And very soon he shall not thirst again.
851,THE WOUNDED,All white and gold the Chief with a troop of horse
852,THE WOUNDED,Trots by. The soldier opens smiling eyes;
853,THE WOUNDED,And at the latest gasp of life he cries:

900,II,"Building sweet music high above my head,"
901,II,And prayers and poems all in praise of you;
902,II,"And, happy in my fading dream, I say:"
903,II,“There will be something ready with the day

905,II,
906,II,"But when the morning comes, the nimble words"

922,III,To soar above the world with silver wings;
923,III,To hear the music of celestial strings;
924,III,To keep the flame within you always true
925,III,Unto your own high pole; and pure as dew
926,III,The fountain that within you sometimes sings.
927,III,
928,III,I think you are an exile in the noise
929,III,Of busy markets; alien to the toys
930,III,"That dazzle others, firing them with greed;"

945,IV,The heavy clouds have lifted and rolled by;

948,IV,And tender as a rose-leaf is the sky.

952,IV,I wonder if the hot and heavy hours
