57,_TO E. A. P._,
58,_TO E. A. P._,
59,_TO E. A. P._,_Beyond all boundaries and pales
60,_TO E. A. P._,You led me hillward. With the clouds
61,_TO E. A. P._,We two were driven and the gales
62,_TO E. A. P._,That filled your soul's delightful sails
63,_TO E. A. P._,Shook my faint spirit's shrouds.
64,_TO E. A. P._,
65,_TO E. A. P._,There where the aeons still emboss
66,_TO E. A. P._,Cromlech and cairn and tufa crown
67,_TO E. A. P._,With lichen cold and stag-horn moss
68,_TO E. A. P._,"And callous suns cross and recross,"
69,_TO E. A. P._,"You paused, and I looked down"
70,_TO E. A. P._,
71,_TO E. A. P._,"And saw the straight strait Roman road,"
72,_TO E. A. P._,"The entangling lanes, our wayward track"
73,_TO E. A. P._,And vestiges of all who strode
74,_TO E. A. P._,On the old quest with the old load
75,_TO E. A. P._,Beckoned me back and back.
76,_TO E. A. P._,
77,_TO E. A. P._,Sweet wood-smoke climbing up the fell
78,_TO E. A. P._,"Met me half-way as down I won,"
79,_TO E. A. P._,And met me too the climbing bell
80,_TO E. A. P._,"That bids the world kneel to a knell,"
81,_TO E. A. P._,A knell ascending to the sun.
82,_TO E. A. P._,
83,_TO E. A. P._,"The holy bell shall tune my note,"
84,_TO E. A. P._,"The stars shall touch my thatch at night,"
85,_TO E. A. P._,Within my spirit's dark stream shall float
86,_TO E. A. P._,"A planet, meek as a child's boat,"
87,_TO E. A. P._,That mocked your utmost height.
88,_TO E. A. P._,
89,_TO E. A. P._,Yet I am yours--your pace is stamped
90,_TO E. A. P._,"On mine, o'er mine your spirit broods--"
91,_TO E. A. P._,Who tread the sanctuary hushed and lamped
92,_TO E. A. P._,With strides that took the heath and tramped
93,_TO E. A. P._,Your hopeless altitudes._

182,THE DISTRACTION,When death shall wreak my life's economy--
183,THE DISTRACTION,Repaid with pains for contemplating thee
184,THE DISTRACTION,
185,THE DISTRACTION,Unwisely out of season. With the rest
186,THE DISTRACTION,"We knelt at Mass, not yet disperst and blest,"

191,THE DISTRACTION,"My child knelt undistracted and demure,"

193,THE DISTRACTION,Did fall into that sin. And ere the close
194,THE DISTRACTION,"Of the grave Canon's ""_Benedicat vos ..._"""
195,THE DISTRACTION,"Had scanned her hair and said, ""How thick it grows"
196,THE DISTRACTION,
197,THE DISTRACTION,"Over the little golden neck of her!"""

210,SIR BAT-EARS,
211,SIR BAT-EARS,Sir Bat-ears was a dog of birth
212,SIR BAT-EARS,"And bred in Aberdeen,"
213,SIR BAT-EARS,But he favoured not his noble kin
214,SIR BAT-EARS,"And so his lot is mean,"
215,SIR BAT-EARS,And Sir Bat-ears sits by the alms-houses
216,SIR BAT-EARS,On the stones with grass between.
217,SIR BAT-EARS,
218,SIR BAT-EARS,Under the ancient archway
219,SIR BAT-EARS,His pleasure is to wait
220,SIR BAT-EARS,Between the two stone pine-apples
221,SIR BAT-EARS,That flank the weathered gate;
222,SIR BAT-EARS,
223,SIR BAT-EARS,"And old, old alms-persons go by,"
224,SIR BAT-EARS,"All rusty, bent and black"
225,SIR BAT-EARS,"""Good day, good day, Sir Bat-ears!"""
226,SIR BAT-EARS,They say and stroke his back.
227,SIR BAT-EARS,
228,SIR BAT-EARS,"And old, old alms-persons go by,"
229,SIR BAT-EARS,"Shaking and wellnigh dead,"
230,SIR BAT-EARS,"""Good night, good night, Sir Bat-ears!"""
231,SIR BAT-EARS,They say and pat his head.
232,SIR BAT-EARS,
233,SIR BAT-EARS,So courted and considered
234,SIR BAT-EARS,"He sits out hour by hour,"
235,SIR BAT-EARS,Benignant in the sunshine
236,SIR BAT-EARS,And prudent in the shower.
237,SIR BAT-EARS,
238,SIR BAT-EARS,"(Nay, stoutly can he stand a storm"
239,SIR BAT-EARS,"And stiffly breast the rain,"
240,SIR BAT-EARS,That rising when the cloud is gone
241,SIR BAT-EARS,He leaves a circle of dry stone
242,SIR BAT-EARS,Whereon to sit again.)
243,SIR BAT-EARS,
244,SIR BAT-EARS,A dozen little door-steps
245,SIR BAT-EARS,"Under the arch are seen,"
246,SIR BAT-EARS,A dozen agèd alms-persons
247,SIR BAT-EARS,To keep them bright and clean;
248,SIR BAT-EARS,
249,SIR BAT-EARS,Two wrinkled hands to scour each step
250,SIR BAT-EARS,With a square of yellow stone--
251,SIR BAT-EARS,But print-marks of Sir Bat-ears' paws
252,SIR BAT-EARS,Bespeckle every one.
253,SIR BAT-EARS,
254,SIR BAT-EARS,"And little eats an alms-person,"
255,SIR BAT-EARS,"But, though his board be bare,"
256,SIR BAT-EARS,There never lacks a bone of the best
257,SIR BAT-EARS,To be Sir Bats-ears' share.
258,SIR BAT-EARS,
259,SIR BAT-EARS,"Mendicant muzzle and shrewd nose,"
260,SIR BAT-EARS,He quests from door to door;
261,SIR BAT-EARS,"Their grace they say, his shadow grey"
262,SIR BAT-EARS,Is instant on the floor--
263,SIR BAT-EARS,"Humblest of all the dogs there be,"
264,SIR BAT-EARS,A pensioner of the poor.

289,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,"Who, newly slumbering on my lap,"
290,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,Stirs in resentful quietude.
291,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,Her little shawl-swathed fists enfold
292,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,One cherished forefinger of mine;
293,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,Her callow hair with Tuscan gold
294,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,Is pencilled in the candle-shine;
295,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,"Her cheeks' sweet heraldry, exprest"
296,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,"Each evening since her happy birth,"
297,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,Is argent to her mother's breast
298,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,And gules to the emblazoning hearth;
299,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,Only the lashes of her eyes
300,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,"Some ancient discontent impairs,"
301,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,"Which, for their abdicated skies,"
302,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,Are pointed with forgotten tears.
303,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,"And so, as simple as a bird,"
304,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,She nestles--there is no child else
305,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,To rouse her with a reckless word

310,COAL AND CANDLELIGHT,To question the allure of sleep.

740,THE ASCENT,These heights of stony solitude were won.
741,THE ASCENT,
742,THE ASCENT,Here on the crack'd white clods I stand elated
743,THE ASCENT,Whose iron verge scarce crumbles at my heels
744,THE ASCENT,So hath the effulgent ether indurated
745,THE ASCENT,The slot of horse-hoofs and the track of wheels;
746,THE ASCENT,
747,THE ASCENT,"And now, and now, the spirit no longer spent"
748,THE ASCENT,"In ease that overtops itself, takes grace,"
749,THE ASCENT,"Cleansed by the sweat of that divine ascent,"
750,THE ASCENT,Exulting in the harsh unshaded place.
751,THE ASCENT,
752,THE ASCENT,For here where God hath been so hard to shackle
753,THE ASCENT,"The martyred earth He hath His first acclaim,"
754,THE ASCENT,"Still the parched flowers burn round His tabernacle,"
