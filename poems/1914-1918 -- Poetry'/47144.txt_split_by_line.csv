47,FOREWORD TO NEW EDITION,"When these poems, written between the ages of fourteen and twenty,"
48,FOREWORD TO NEW EDITION,"first appeared, I was serving in France and had no leisure for getting"
49,FOREWORD TO NEW EDITION,"the final proofs altogether as I wanted them. The same year, but too"
50,FOREWORD TO NEW EDITION,"late, I decided on several alterations in the text, including the"
51,FOREWORD TO NEW EDITION,suppression of two small poems inexcusable even as early work. These
52,FOREWORD TO NEW EDITION,"amendations appear in this new edition, but I have left the bulk of the"
53,FOREWORD TO NEW EDITION,book as it stood.

63,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,THE POET IN THE NURSERY
64,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,
65,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,
66,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,The youngest poet down the shelves was fumbling
67,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"In a dim library, just behind the chair"
68,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,From which the ancient poet was mum-mumbling
69,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"A song about some Lovers at a Fair,"
70,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,Pulling his long white beard and gently grumbling
71,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,That rhymes were beastly things and never there.
72,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,
73,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"And as I groped, the whole time I was thinking"
74,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,About the tragic poem I'd been writing--
75,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"An old man's life of beer and whisky drinking,"
76,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,His years of kidnapping and wicked fighting;
77,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"And how at last, into a fever sinking,"
78,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"Remorsefully he died, his bedclothes biting."
79,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,
80,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,But suddenly I saw the bright green cover
81,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,Of a thin pretty book right down below;
82,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"I snatched it up and turned the pages over,"
83,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"To find it full of poetry, and so"
84,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,Put it down my neck with quick hands like a lover
85,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,And turned to watch if the old man saw it go.
86,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,
87,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,The book was full of funny muddling mazes
88,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"Each rounded off into a lovely song,"
89,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,And most extraordinary and monstrous phrases
90,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"Knotted with rhymes like a slave-driver's thong,"
91,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,And metre twisting like a chain of daisies
92,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,With great big splendid words a sentence long.
93,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,
94,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"I took the book to bed with me and gloated,"
95,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"Learning the lines that seemed to sound most grand,"
96,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,So soon the pretty emerald green was coated
97,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,"With jam and greasy marks from my hot hand,"
98,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,While round the nursery for long months there floated
99,THE POET IN THE NURSERY,Wonderful words no one could understand.

163,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,Through the dreams of yesternight
164,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,My blood brother great in fight
165,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,"I saw lying, slowly dying"
166,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,Where the weary woods were sighing
167,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,"With the rustle of the birches,"
168,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,With the quiver of the larches....
169,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,Woodland fauns with hairy haunches
170,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,Grin in wonder through the branches
171,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,Woodland fauns that know no fear.
172,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,"Wondering, they wander near"
173,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,"Munching mushrooms red as coral,"
174,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,"Bunches, too, of rue and sorrel;"
175,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,"Wonder at his radiant fairness,"
176,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,"At his dinted, shattered harness,"
177,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,"With uncouth and bestial sounds,"
178,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,Knowing nought of war or wounds:
179,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,But the crimson life-blood oozes
180,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,"And make roses of the daisies,"
181,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,Persian carpets of the mosses--
182,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,Softly now his spirit passes
183,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,"As the bee forsakes the lily,"
184,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,As the berry leaves the holly;
185,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,"But the fauns still think him living,"
186,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,And with bay leaves they are weaving
187,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,Crowns to deck him. Well they may!
188,THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS,He was worthy of the Bay.

201,WILLAREE,"The fleecy cloudlets are not his,"

205,WILLAREE,
206,WILLAREE,His home is on the mountain-top
207,WILLAREE,"Where I love to be,"

282,YOUTH AND FOLLY,--_A Charterhouse Sermon_)
283,YOUTH AND FOLLY,
284,YOUTH AND FOLLY,In Chapel often when I bawl
285,YOUTH AND FOLLY,"The hymns, to show I'm musical,"
286,YOUTH AND FOLLY,With bright eye and cheery voice
287,YOUTH AND FOLLY,"Bidding Christian folk rejoice,"
288,YOUTH AND FOLLY,"Shame be it said, I've not a thought"
289,YOUTH AND FOLLY,Of the One Being whom I ought
290,YOUTH AND FOLLY,To worship: with unwitting roar
291,YOUTH AND FOLLY,Other godheads I adore.
292,YOUTH AND FOLLY,I celebrate the Gods of Mirth

545,THE MORNING BEFORE THE BATTLE,Down a deserted garden full of flowers.
546,THE MORNING BEFORE THE BATTLE,"... Carelessly sang, pinned roses on my breast,"
547,THE MORNING BEFORE THE BATTLE,"Reached for a cherry-bunch--and then, then, Death"
548,THE MORNING BEFORE THE BATTLE,Blew through the garden from the North and East
549,THE MORNING BEFORE THE BATTLE,And blighted every beauty with chill breath.
550,THE MORNING BEFORE THE BATTLE,
551,THE MORNING BEFORE THE BATTLE,"I looked, and ah, my wraith before me stood,"
552,THE MORNING BEFORE THE BATTLE,His head all battered in by violent blows:
553,THE MORNING BEFORE THE BATTLE,The fruit between my lips to clotted blood
554,THE MORNING BEFORE THE BATTLE,"Was transubstantiate, and the pale rose"
555,THE MORNING BEFORE THE BATTLE,"Smelt sickly, till it seemed through a swift tear-flood"

660,II.--THE ADVENTURE,I crept up close and slung a pointed stone
661,II.--THE ADVENTURE,"With all my might: I must have hit his head,"

664,II.--THE ADVENTURE,
665,II.--THE ADVENTURE,I expect that he'd escaped from a Wild Beast Show
666,II.--THE ADVENTURE,By pulling down his cage with an angry tear;

670,II.--THE ADVENTURE,I brought my brother up as quick's I could
671,II.--THE ADVENTURE,But there was nothing left when he did come:
