42,FORWARD,THE greater part of these verses dealing with the war were written in
43,FORWARD,"France during my recent seven months’ sojourn there, and for the purpose"
44,FORWARD,of using in entertainments given in camps and hospitals to thousands of
45,FORWARD,American soldiers.
46,FORWARD,
47,FORWARD,They were the result of coming into close contact with the soldiers’ mind
48,FORWARD,"and heart, and were intentionally expressed in the simplest manner,"
49,FORWARD,without any consideration of methods approved by modern critics.  The
50,FORWARD,fact that I have been asked to autograph scores of copies of many of
51,FORWARD,these verses (and one of them to the extent of 350 copies) is more
52,FORWARD,gratifying to me than would be the highest encomiums of the purely
53,FORWARD,literary critic.

160,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,
161,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,
162,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"I had seen our splendid soldiers in their khaki uniforms,"
163,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,And their leaders with a Sam Brown belt;
164,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"I had seen the fighting Britons and Colonials in swarms,"
165,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"I had seen the blue-clad Frenchmen, and I felt"
166,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,That the mighty martial show
167,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"Had no new sight to bestow,"
168,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"Till I walked on Piccadilly, and my word!"
169,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,By the bonnie Highland laddies
170,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"In their kilts and their plaidies,"
171,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,To a wholly new sensation I was stirred.
172,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,
173,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"They were like some old-time picture, or a scene from out a play,"
174,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"They were stalwart, they were young, and debonnair;"
175,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"Their jaunty little caps they wore in such a fetching way,"
176,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"And they showed their handsome legs, and didn’t care—"
177,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,And they seemed to own the town
178,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,As they strode on up and down—
179,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"Oh, they surely were a sight for tired eyes!"
180,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"Those braw, bonnie laddies"
181,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"In their kilts and their plaidies,"
182,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,And I stared at them with pleasure and surprise.
183,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,
184,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,I had read about the valour of old Scotland’s warrior sons—
185,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"How they fought to a finish, or else fell;"
186,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"I had heard the name bestowed on them by agitated Huns,"
187,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,Who called these skirted soldiers ‘Dames of Hell’;
188,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,And I gave them right of way
189,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"On their London holiday,"
190,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"As I met them swinging down the street and Strand,"
191,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"Those bonnie, bonnie laddies"
192,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"In their kilts and their plaidies,"
193,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,And I breathed a blessing on them and their land
194,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,
195,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,Now the world is all rejoicing that the end of war has come—
196,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"And no heart is any gladder than my own,"
197,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"That the brutal, blatant voices of the guns at last are dumb,"
198,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,And the Dove of Peace from out her cage has flown.
199,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"Yet, when men no more march by,"
200,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"Making pictures for the eye,"
201,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"There’s a vital dash of colour earth will lack,"
202,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,When the brave Highland laddies
203,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,"Drop their kilts and their plaidies,"
204,THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES,And return to common clothes of grey or black!

229,MEN OF THE SEA,I sing of the valour that ploughed a path
230,MEN OF THE SEA,"Straight through the snares of a crafty foe,"
231,MEN OF THE SEA,"Through billows raging with wintry wrath,"
232,MEN OF THE SEA,And over the dens of the devils below.
233,MEN OF THE SEA,
234,MEN OF THE SEA,To the splendid heroes of Jutland Bank
235,MEN OF THE SEA,And the Royal Navy I give their due;
236,MEN OF THE SEA,"And cheek by jowl with them all, I rank"

695,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","_Yea_, _give us your lives in truth_,"
696,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",_Give us your sweetness and grace_

698,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","_Of the flower of manhood and youth_,"
699,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",_Gone into the dust of the tomb_.
700,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",
701,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","This is the vast stupendous hour of Time,"
702,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","When nothing counts but sacrifice and faith,"
703,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",Service and self-forgetfulness.  Sublime
704,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",And awful are these moments charged with death
705,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",And red with slaughter.  Yet God’s purpose thrives
706,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",In all this holocaust of human lives.
707,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",
708,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",I say God’s purpose thrives.  Just in the measure
709,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","That men have flung away their lust for gain,"
710,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","Stopped in their mad pursuit of worldly pleasure,"
711,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",And boldly faced unprecedented pain
712,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","And dangers, without thinking of the cost,"
713,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",So thrives God’s purpose in the holocaust.
714,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",
715,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",Death is a little thing: all men must die;
716,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","But when ideals die, God grieves in Heaven."
717,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",Therefore I think it was the reason why
718,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",This Armageddon to the world was given.
719,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","The Soul of man, forgetful of its birth,"
720,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",Was losing sight of everything but earth.
721,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",
722,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","Up from these many million graves shall spring,"
723,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",A shining harvest for the coming race.
724,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",An Army of Invisibles shall bring
725,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",A glorified lost faith back to its place.
726,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",And men shall know there is a higher goal
727,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",Than earthly triumphs for the human soul.
728,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",
729,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","They are not dead—they are not dead, I say,"
730,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",These men whose mortal forms are in the sod.
731,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","A grand Advance-Guard marching on its way,"
732,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",Their Souls move upwards to salute their God!
733,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",While to their comrades who are in the strife
734,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","They cry, ‘Fight on!  Death is the dawn of life.’"
735,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",
736,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",We had forgotten all the depth and beauty
737,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",And lofty purport of that old true word
738,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",Deplaced by pleasure—that old good word _duty_.
739,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",Now by its meaning is the whole world stirred.
740,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","These men died for it; for it, now, we give,"
741,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","And sacrifice, and serve, and toil, and live."
742,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",From out our hearts had gone a high devotion
743,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",For anything.  It took a mighty wrath—
744,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","Against great evil to wake strong emotion,"
745,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",And put us back upon the righteous path.
746,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",It took a mingled stream of tears and blood
747,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",To cut the channel through to Brotherhood.
748,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",
749,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",That word meant nothing on our lips in peace:
750,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",We had despoiled it by our castes and classes.
751,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",But when this savage carnage finds surcease
752,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",A new ideal will unite the masses.
753,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",And there shall be True Brotherhood with men—
754,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",The Christly Spirit stirring earth again.
755,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",
756,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","For this our men have suffered, fought, and died."
757,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",And we who can but dimly see the end
758,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","Are guarded by their spirits glorified,"
759,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","Who help us on our way, while they ascend."
760,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","They are not dead—they are not dead, I say,"
761,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",These men whose graves we decorate to-day.
762,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",
763,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",America and France walk hand in hand;
764,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","As one, their hearts beat through the coming years:"
765,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","One is the aim and purpose of each land,"
766,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",Baptized with holy water of their tears.
767,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","To-day they worship with one faith, and know"
768,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",Grief’s first Communion in God’s House of Woe.

770,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","Great Liberty, the Goddess at our gates,"

772,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",A host of Angels on that soul awaits
773,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",To lead it up to triumph at the goal.
774,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918","Along the path of Victory they tread,"
775,"FRANCE, MAY 30, 1918",Moves the majestic cortège of our dead.

1834,CONVERSATION,We were a baker’s dozen in the house—six women and six men
1835,CONVERSATION,Besides myself; and all of us had known
1836,CONVERSATION,Those benefits supposed to come from school and church and brush and
1837,CONVERSATION,"pen,"
1838,CONVERSATION,And opportunities of being thrown
1839,CONVERSATION,In contact with the cultured and the gifted people of the day.
1840,CONVERSATION,Being the thirteenth one among six pairs
1841,CONVERSATION,I deemed it wise to keep apart and let the others have their say:
1842,CONVERSATION,"And from my vantage-place upon the stairs,"
1843,CONVERSATION,"Or in a corner, where I seemed to read, I listened for some word"
1844,CONVERSATION,"That would make life seem sweeter, or cast light"
1845,CONVERSATION,Upon the goal toward which all footsteps wend: and this was what I
1846,CONVERSATION,heard
1847,CONVERSATION,Throughout each day and half of every night.
1848,CONVERSATION,"The men talked business, politics, and trade;"
1849,CONVERSATION,"They told of safe investments, and great chances"
1850,CONVERSATION,For speculation.  (One man who had made
1851,CONVERSATION,"Pleasure his art, described the newest dances"
1852,CONVERSATION,"And dwelt upon each chassé, glide, and whirl"
1853,CONVERSATION,As lovers dwell upon the charms of some fair girl.)
1854,CONVERSATION,
1855,CONVERSATION,"They talked of war, and tried to find its cause,"
1856,CONVERSATION,And quite deplored the fact that wars must come.
1857,CONVERSATION,"But since this desperate condition was,"
1858,CONVERSATION,They carefully computed what the sum
1859,CONVERSATION,"Of profit might be to a land of peace,"
1860,CONVERSATION,And wondered if times would be harder should war cease.
1861,CONVERSATION,
1862,CONVERSATION,They spoke of games and sports; told many a story
1863,CONVERSATION,That made the listeners laugh; then back from these
1864,CONVERSATION,"Always they harked to money, or the gory"
1865,CONVERSATION,And savage drama playing overseas.
1866,CONVERSATION,Then there were tales from club and smoking-room—
1867,CONVERSATION,"The submarines of gossip, bringing some name doom."
1868,CONVERSATION,
1869,CONVERSATION,"The women talked of fashions and of plays,"
1870,CONVERSATION,But more of players and their private lives;
1871,CONVERSATION,"Related tittle-tattle of their words and ways,"
1872,CONVERSATION,Their lightning change of husbands and of wives.
1873,CONVERSATION,"And there was chat of garments and their price,"
1874,CONVERSATION,Of operas and balls and all that gives life spice.
1875,CONVERSATION,
1876,CONVERSATION,"Some talk there was of music, pictures, books,"
1877,CONVERSATION,"But of musicians, painters, authors, more."
1878,CONVERSATION,The way they lived—their methods and their looks—
1879,CONVERSATION,The colour of their eyes—the clothes they wore;
1880,CONVERSATION,"And whether it was true, as had been stated,"
1881,CONVERSATION,That gifted people were quite sure to be mis-mated.
1882,CONVERSATION,
1883,CONVERSATION,"They talked of servants, menus, and disease,"
1884,CONVERSATION,And operations.  Each one came in line
1885,CONVERSATION,"With some astounding tale to tell of these,"
1886,CONVERSATION,"And of her surgeon’s skill, which seemed divine."
1887,CONVERSATION,_But of that vast Domain where live our dead_
1888,CONVERSATION,"_And where we all are hurrying_, _no word was said_."
1889,CONVERSATION,
1890,CONVERSATION,"_When we know that goal awaits each one of us a little farther on_,"
1891,CONVERSATION,_When we know how an ever-increasing company of friends is gathered

1893,CONVERSATION,_Why do we not speak of it in our daily conversation_?
1894,CONVERSATION,_Why do we not familiarise our minds with thoughts of worlds unseen_?
1895,CONVERSATION,_There are many beautiful things to be learned of that country_.
1896,CONVERSATION,"_There are sacred books of great travellers_, _whose souls have"

1898,CONVERSATION,
1899,CONVERSATION,_There are truths which have been learned in visions and by

1902,CONVERSATION,_All the wise men of the world did not die two thousand years ago_!
1903,CONVERSATION,"_Why do we not talk of these eternal truths_,"
1904,CONVERSATION,"_Instead of wasting all our words on the evanesent_, _the"
1905,CONVERSATION,"ever-changing_, _the trivial_, _and the unimportant_?"

2233,ONE BY ONE,Is where we enter to gain new force
2234,ONE BY ONE,Before we are sent on another course.
2235,ONE BY ONE,
2236,ONE BY ONE,"And one by one, as He calls us back,"

2253,PRAYER,In paths of thought as yet untrod;
2254,PRAYER,The mind that can conceive
2255,PRAYER,Large visions of a wider way

2272,PRAYER,Let us not shame Thee with a creed

2295,BE NOT DISMAYED,"Must suffer anguish, when that last drawn breath"
2296,BE NOT DISMAYED,Leaves such long silence; but let not thy faith
2297,BE NOT DISMAYED,Fail for a moment in God’s boundless grace.

2326,ASCENSION,
2327,ASCENSION,I have been down in the darkest water—
2328,ASCENSION,"Deep, deep down where no light could pierce;"
2329,ASCENSION,"Alone with the things that are bent on slaughter,"
2330,ASCENSION,The mindless things that are cruel and fierce.
2331,ASCENSION,"I have fought with fear in my wave-walled prison,"
2332,ASCENSION,And begged for the beautiful boon of death;
2333,ASCENSION,But out of the billows my soul has risen
2334,ASCENSION,To glorify God with my latest breath.
2335,ASCENSION,
2336,ASCENSION,There is no potion I have not tasted
2337,ASCENSION,Of all the bitters in life’s large store;
2338,ASCENSION,And never a drop of the gall was wasted
2339,ASCENSION,"That the lords of Karma saw fit to pour,"
2340,ASCENSION,"Though I cried as my Elder Brother before me,"
2341,ASCENSION,"‘Father in heaven, let pass this cup!’"
2342,ASCENSION,And the only response from the still skies o’er me
2343,ASCENSION,Was the brew held close for my lips to sup.
2344,ASCENSION,
2345,ASCENSION,"Yet I have grown strong on the gall Elysian,"
2346,ASCENSION,And a courage has come that all things dares;
2347,ASCENSION,And I have been given an inner vision
2348,ASCENSION,Of the wonderful world where my dear one fares;
2349,ASCENSION,And I have had word from the great Hereafter—
2350,ASCENSION,"A marvellous message that throbs with truth,"
2351,ASCENSION,"And mournful weeping has changed to laughter,"
2352,ASCENSION,And grief has changed into the joy of youth.
2353,ASCENSION,
2354,ASCENSION,"Oh! there was a time when I supped sweet potions,"
2355,ASCENSION,"And lightly uttered profound belief,"
2356,ASCENSION,Before I went down in the swirling oceans
2357,ASCENSION,And fought with madness and doubt and grief.
2358,ASCENSION,"Now I am climbing the Hills of Knowledge,"
2359,ASCENSION,"And I speak unfearing, and say ‘I know,’"
2360,ASCENSION,"Though it be not to church, or to book, or college,"
2361,ASCENSION,But to God Himself that my debt I owe.
2362,ASCENSION,
2363,ASCENSION,"For the ceaseless prayer of a soul is heeded,"
2364,ASCENSION,When the prayer asks only for light and faith;
2365,ASCENSION,And the faith and the light and the knowledge needed
2366,ASCENSION,Shall gild with glory the path to death.
2367,ASCENSION,"Oh! heart of the world by sorrow shaken,"
2368,ASCENSION,Hear ye the message I have to give:
2369,ASCENSION,"The seal from the lips of the dead is taken,"
2370,ASCENSION,"And they can say to you, ‘Lo! we live.’"

2376,THE DEADLIEST SIN,
2377,THE DEADLIEST SIN,
2378,THE DEADLIEST SIN,There are not many sins when once we sift them.
2379,THE DEADLIEST SIN,In actions of evolving human souls
2380,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Striving to reach high goals
2381,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"And falling backward into dust and mire,"
2382,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Some element we find that seems to lift them
2383,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Above our condemnation—even higher
2384,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Into the realm of pity and compassion.
2385,THE DEADLIEST SIN,So beauteous a thing as love itself can fashion
2386,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"A chain of sins; descending to desire,"
2387,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"It wanders into dangerous paths, and leads"
2388,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"To most unholy deeds,"
2389,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"And light-struck, walks in madness toward the night."
2390,THE DEADLIEST SIN,
2391,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"Wrong oft-times is an over-ripened right,"
2392,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"A rank weed grown from some neglected flower,"
2393,THE DEADLIEST SIN,The lightning uncontrolled: flames meant for joy
2394,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"And beauty, used to ravage and destroy."
2395,THE DEADLIEST SIN,For sins like these repentance can atone.
2396,THE DEADLIEST SIN,There is one sin alone
2397,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"Which seems all unforgivable, because"
2398,THE DEADLIEST SIN,It springs from no temptation and no need
2399,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"And no desire, save to make sweet faith bleed,"
2400,THE DEADLIEST SIN,And to defame God’s laws.
2401,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Oh! viler than the murderer or the thief
2402,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"Who slays the body and who robs the purse,"
2403,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Is he who strives to kill the mind’s belief
2404,THE DEADLIEST SIN,And rob it of its hope
2405,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Of life beyond this little pain-filled span.
2406,THE DEADLIEST SIN,God has no curse
2407,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"Quite dark enough to punish such a man,"
2408,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"Who, seeing how souls grope"
2409,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"And suffer in this world of mighty losses,"
2410,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"And how hearts stagger on beneath life’s crosses,"
2411,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Yet strives to rob them of their staff of faith
2412,THE DEADLIEST SIN,And make them think dark death
2413,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Ends all existence; think the worshipped child
2414,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Cold in its mother’s arms is but a clod
2415,THE DEADLIEST SIN,And has not gone to God;
2416,THE DEADLIEST SIN,That souls united by love undefiled
2417,THE DEADLIEST SIN,And holy can by death be torn asunder
2418,THE DEADLIEST SIN,To meet no more.
2419,THE DEADLIEST SIN,It must be true that under
2420,THE DEADLIEST SIN,This earth of ours there lies a Purgatory
2421,THE DEADLIEST SIN,For those who seek to rob grief of the glory
2422,THE DEADLIEST SIN,That shines through hope of life immortal.  In
2423,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Sin’s lexicon this is the vilest sin—
2424,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"Needless and cruel, ugly, gaunt and mean,"
2425,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"Without one poor excuse on which to lean,"
2426,THE DEADLIEST SIN,"A vandal sin, that with no hope of gain"
2427,THE DEADLIEST SIN,Finds pleasure only in another’s pain.
2428,THE DEADLIEST SIN,
