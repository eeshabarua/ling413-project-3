139,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE
140,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
141,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
142,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"When Voltaire sat down to write a book on Epic Poetry, he dedicated his"
143,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"first chapter to ""Differences of Taste in Nations."" A critic of to-day"
144,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"might well find it necessary, on the threshold of a general inquiry, to"
145,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"expatiate on ""Differences of Taste in Generations."" Changes of standard"
146,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"in the arts are always taking place, but it is only with advancing"
147,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"years, perhaps, that we begin to be embarrassed by the recurrence of"
148,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"them. In early youth we fight for the new forms of art, for the new"
149,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"æsthetic shibboleths, and in that happy ardour of battle we have no time"
150,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,or inclination to regret the demigods whom we dispossess. But the years
151,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"glide on, and, behold! one morning, we wake up to find our own"
152,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"predilections treated with contempt, and the objects of our own idolatry"
153,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"consigned to the waste-paper basket. Then the matter becomes serious,"
154,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"and we must either go on struggling for a cause inevitably lost, or we"
155,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"must give up the whole matter in indifference. This week I read, over"
156,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,the signature of a very clever and very popular literary character of
157,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"our day, the remark that Wordsworth's was ""a genteel mind of the third"
158,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"rank."" I put down the newspaper in which this airy dictum was printed,"
159,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"and, for the first time, I was glad that poor Mr. Matthew Arnold was no"
160,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"longer with us. But, of course, the evolutions of taste must go on,"
161,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"whether they hurt the living and the dead, or no."
162,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
163,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Is there, then, no such thing as a permanent element of poetic beauty?"
164,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,The curious fact is that leading critics in each successive generation
165,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"are united in believing that there is, and that the reigning favourite"
166,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"conforms to it. The life of a reputation is like the life of a plant,"
167,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"and seems, in these days, to be like the life of an annual. We watch the"
168,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"seed, admiration for Wordsworth, planted about 1795, shoot obscurely"
169,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"from the ground, and gradually clothe itself with leaves till about"
170,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"1840; then it bursts into blossom of rapturous praise, and about 1870 is"
171,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"hung with clusters of the fruit of ""permanent"" appreciation. In 1919,"
172,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"little more than a century from its first evolution in obscurity, it"
173,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"recedes again in the raggedness of obloquy, and cumbers the earth, as"
174,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"dim old ""genteel"" Wordsworth, whom we are assured that nobody reads. But"
175,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"why were ""the best judges"" scornful in 1800 and again in 1919 of what"
176,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"gave the noblest and the most inspiriting pleasure to ""the best judges"""
177,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"in 1870? The execution of the verse has not altered, the conditions of"
178,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"imagination seem the same, why then is the estimate always changing? Is"
179,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"every form of poetic taste, is all trained enjoyment of poetry, merely a"
180,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,graduated illusion which goes up and down like a wave of the sea and
181,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"carries ""the best judges"" with it? If not, who is right, and who is"
182,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"wrong, and what is the use of dogmatising? Let us unite to quit all vain"
183,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"ambition, and prefer the jangle of the music-halls, with its direct"
184,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"""æsthetic thrill."""
185,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
186,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"So far as I know, the only philosopher who has dared to face this"
187,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"problem is Mr. Balfour, in the brilliant second chapter of his"
188,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"""Foundations of Belief."" He has there asked, ""Is there any fixed and"
189,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"permanent element in beauty?"" The result of his inquiry is"
190,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,disconcerting; after much discussion he decides that there is not. Mr.
191,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Balfour deals, in particular, with only two forms of art, Music and"
192,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Dress, but he tacitly includes the others with them. It is certain that"
193,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,the result of his investigations is the singularly stultifying one that
194,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"we are not permitted to expect ""permanent relations"" in or behind the"
195,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"feeling of poetic beauty, which may be indifferently awakened by Blake"
196,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,to-day and by Hayley to-morrow. If the critic says that the verse of
197,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Blake is beautiful and that of Hayley is not, he merely ""expounds"
198,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"case-made law."" The result seems to be that no canons of taste exist;"
199,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"that what are called ""laws"" of style are enacted only for those who make"
200,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"them, and for those whom the makers can bully into accepting their"
201,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"legislation, a new generation of lawbreakers being perfectly free to"
202,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,repeal the code. Southey yesterday and Keats to-day; why not Southey
203,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"again to-morrow, or perhaps Tupper? Such is the cynical _cul-de-sac_"
204,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,into which the logic of a philosopher drives us.
205,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
206,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,We have had in France an example of _volte-face_ in taste which I
207,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,confess has left me gasping. I imagine that if Mr. Balfour was able to
208,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"spare a moment from the consideration of fiscal reform, he must have"
209,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,spent it in triumphing over the fate of M. Sully-Prudhomme. In the month
210,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"of September 1906 this poet closed, after a protracted agony, ""that long"
211,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"disease, his life."" He had compelled respect by his courage in the face"
212,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"of hopeless pain, and, one might suppose, some gratitude by the"
213,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"abundance of his benefactions. His career was more than blameless, it"
214,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"was singularly exemplary. Half-blind, half-paralysed, for a long time"
215,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"very poor, pious without fanaticism, patient, laborious, devoted to his"
216,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"friends, he seems to have been one of those extraordinary beings whose"
217,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,fortitude in the face of affliction knows no abatement. It would be
218,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,ridiculous to quote any of these virtues as a reason for admiring the
219,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,poetry of Sully-Prudhomme. I mention them merely to show that there was
220,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,nothing in his personal temperament to arouse hatred or in his personal
221,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"conditions to excuse envy. Nothing to account for the, doubtless,"
222,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,entirely sincere detestation which his poetry seemed to awaken in all
223,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"""the best minds"" directly he was dead."
224,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
225,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"As every one knows, from about 1870 to 1890, Sully-Prudhomme was,"
226,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"without a rival, the favourite living poet of the French. Victor Hugo"
227,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"was there, of course, until 1885--and posthumously until much later--but"
228,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"he was a god, and the object of idolatry. All who loved human poetry,"
229,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"the poetry of sweetness and light, took Sully-Prudhomme to their heart"
230,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,of hearts. The _Stances et Poèmes_ of 1865 had perhaps the warmest
231,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,welcome that ever the work of a new poet had in France. Théophile
232,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,Gautier instantly pounced upon _Le Vase Brisé_ (since too-famous) and
233,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"introduced it to a thousand school-girls. Sainte-Beuve, though grown old"
234,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"and languid, waked up to celebrate the psychology and the music of this"
235,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"new poetry, so delicate, fresh and transparent. An unknown beauty of"
236,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"extreme refinement seemed to have been created in it, a beauty made up"
237,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"of lucidity, pathos and sobriety. Readers who are now approaching"
238,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"seventy will not forget with what emotion they listened, for instance,"
239,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"to that dialogue between the long-dead father and the newly-buried son,"
240,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,which closes:--
241,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
242,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"""J' ai laissé ma soeur et ma mère"
243,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,Et les beaux livres que j' ai lus;
244,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Vous n'avez pas de bru, mon père,"
245,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"On m'a blesse, je n'aime plus."""
246,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
247,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"""De tes aïeux compte le nombre,"
248,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Va baiser leurs fronts inconnus,"
249,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,Et viens faire ton lit dans l'ombre
250,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,A côté des derniers venus.
251,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
252,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"""Ne pleure pas, dors dans l'argile"
253,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"En espérant le grand reveit."""
254,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"""O père, qu'il est difficile"
255,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"De ne plus penser au soleil!"""
256,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
257,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"This body of verse, to which was presently added fresh collections--_Les"
258,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Epreuves_ (1886), _Les Vaines Tendresses_ (1875), _Le Prisme_"
259,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"(1886),--was welcomed by the elder Sanhedrim, and still more"
260,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,vociferously and unanimously by the younger priesthood of criticism. It
261,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"pleased the superfine amateurs of poetry, it was accepted with"
262,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,enthusiasm by the thousands who enjoy without analysing their enjoyment.
263,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"In 1880, to have questioned that Sully-Prudhomme was a very noble poet"
264,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"would have been like challenging Tennyson in 1870, or Cowley in 1660."
265,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,Jules Lemaître claimed that he was the greatest artist in symbols that
266,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"France had ever produced. Brunetière, so seldom moved by modern"
267,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"literature, celebrated with ardour the author of _Les Vaines Tendresses_"
268,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,as having succeeded better than any other writer who had ever lived in
269,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,translating into perfect language the dawn and the twilight of emotion.
270,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,That Gaston Paris and M. Anatole France competed in lofty praise of the
271,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"lyrics of Sully-Prudhomme, is perhaps less remarkable than that Paul"
272,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Verlaine, whom all the younger schools still look upon as their apostle"
273,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"and guide, declared, in reviewing _Les Ecuries d'Augias_, that the force"
274,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,of style of Sully-Prudhomme was excelled only by the beauty of his
275,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,detail. It is needless to multiply examples of the unanimous praise
276,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,given by the divers schools of criticism to Sully-Prudhomme up to about
277,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"1890. His was, perhaps, the least contested literary glory of France."
278,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
279,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,His death startlingly reminded us that this state of things had to be
280,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,entirely reversed. It is true that the peculiar talent of
281,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Sully-Prudhomme, being almost exclusively lyrical, scarcely survived his"
282,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"youth, and that he cumbered his moon of sands with two huge and clumsy"
283,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"wrecks, _La Justice_ (1878) and _Le Bonheur_ (1898), round which the"
284,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,feet of the fairies could hardly be expected to trip. One must be an
285,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,academician and hopelessly famous before one dares to inflict two
286,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"elephantine didactic epics on one's admirers. Unfortunately, too, the"
287,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,poet undertook to teach the art of verse in his _Réflexions_ (1892) and
288,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"his _Testament Poétique_ (1901), brochures which greatly irritated the"
289,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"young. It is probably wise for academicians, whether poets or the"
290,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"reverse, to sit beside their nectar, and not to hurl bolts down into the"
291,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"valley. But, behind these errors of judgment, there they remain--those"
292,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"early volumes, which seemed to us all so full of exquisite little"
293,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"masterpieces. Why is it that nobody, except a few elderly persons, any"
294,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,longer delights in them? The notices which Sully-Prudhomme's death
295,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,awakened in the Paris Press were either stamped with the mark of old
296,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"contemporary affection, or else, when they were not abusive, were as"
297,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"frigid as the tomb itself. ""Ses tendresses sucrées, sirupeuses, sont"
298,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"vaines en effet,"" said a critic of importance! Indeed, it would appear"
299,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,so; and where are the laurels of yester-year?
300,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
301,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,To those who were young when Sully-Prudhomme entered into his
302,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,immortality it seems impossible to realise that the glory has already
303,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"departed. Gaston Paris celebrated ""the penetrating sincerity and the"
304,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"exquisite expression of feeling"" which distinguished Sully-Prudhomme"
305,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"above all other poets. He was the bard of the inner life, sincere and"
306,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"dignified, full of melancholy reverie. A great critic compared _La Vote"
307,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,Lactic_ and _Les Stalactites_ with the far-off sound of bells heard down
308,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,some lovely valley in a golden afternoon. Yet the images and the
309,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"language were precise; Sully-Prudhomme was a mathematician, and if he"
310,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"was reproached with anything like a fault, it was that his style was"
311,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,slightly geometrical. It would be otiose to collect any more tributes to
312,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"his genius, as it appeared to all Frenchmen, cultivated or"
313,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"semi-cultivated, about the year 1880. With an analysis of"
314,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Sully-Prudhomme's poetry I am not here concerned, but with the question"
315,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"of why it is that such an authority as Rémy de Gourmont could, in 1907,"
316,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,without awakening any protest among persons under fifty say that it was
317,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"a ""sort of social crime"" to impose such balderdash as the verse of"
318,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,Sully-Prudhomme on the public.
319,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
320,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"It is not needful to quote other living critics, who may think such"
321,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,prolongation of their severities ungraceful. But a single contrast will
322,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"suffice. When, in 1881, Sully-Prudhomme was elected to the French"
323,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Academy, expert opinion throughout the Press was unanimous in admitting"
324,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,that this was an honour deservedly given to the best lyric poet of the
325,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"age. In 1906, when a literary journal sent out this question, ""Who is"
326,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"the poet you love best?"" and was answered by more than two hundred"
327,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"writers of verse, the diversity of opinion was indeed excessive; such"
328,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"poets as Sainte-Beuve, as Brizeux, as Rodenbach, received votes, all the"
329,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"great masters received many. But Sully-Prudhomme, alone, received not"
330,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"one vote. A new generation had arisen, and one of its leaders, with"
331,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"cruel wit, transferred to the reputation of the author his own most"
332,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"famous line:--""N'y touchez pas, il est brisé."""
333,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
334,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,It is necessary to recollect that we are not dealing with the phenomenon
335,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,of the inability of very astute literary people to recognise at once a
336,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,startling new sort of beauty. When Robert Browning lent the best poems
337,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"of Keats to Mrs. Carlyle, she read them and returned them with the"
338,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"remark that ""almost any young gentleman with a sweet tooth might be"
339,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"expected to write such things."" Mrs. Carlyle was a very clever woman,"
340,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"but she was not quite ""educated up to"" Keats. The history of letters is"
341,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"full of these grotesque limitations of taste, in the presence of great"
342,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"art which has not yet been ""classed."" But we are here considering the"
343,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,much stranger and indeed extremely disconcerting case of a product which
344,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"has been accepted, with acclamation, by the judges of one generation,"
345,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"and is contemptuously hooted out of court by the next. It is not, on"
346,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"this occasion, Sully-Prudhomme whom we are considering, but his critics."
347,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"If Théophile Gautier was right in 1867, Rémy de Gourmont must have been"
348,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,wrong in 1907; yet they both were honourable men in the world of
349,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"criticism. Nor is it merely the dictum of a single man, which, however"
350,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"ingenious, may be paradoxical. It is worse than that; it is the fact"
351,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"that one whole generation seems to have agreed with Gautier, and that"
352,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,another whole generation is of the same mind as Rémy de Gourmont.
353,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
354,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Then it is that Mr. Balfour, like Galuppi with his ""cold music,"" comes"
355,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,in and tells us that this is precisely what we have to expect. All
356,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"beauty consists in the possession of certain relations, which being"
357,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"withdrawn, beauty disappears from the object that seemed to possess it."
358,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,There is no permanent element in poetic excellence. We are not to demand
359,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"any settled opinion about poetry. So Mr. Balfour seems to creak it, and"
360,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,we want the heart to scold. But is it quite so certain that there is no
361,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,fixed norm of beauty imaginable? Is it the fact that poetic pleasure
362,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"cannot ""be supposed to last any longer than the transient reaction"
363,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"between it"" and the temporary prejudice of our senses? If this be true,"
364,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,then are critics of all men most miserable.
365,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
366,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Yet, deeply dejected as it leaves me to know that very clever people"
367,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"despise the ""genteel third-rate mind"" of Wordsworth, I am not quite"
368,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,certain that I yield to Mr. Balfour's brilliant and paralysing logic.
369,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"That eminent philosopher seems to say ""you find the poets, whom you"
370,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"revered in your youth, treated with contempt in your old age. Well! It"
371,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"is very sad, and perhaps it would annoy me too, if I were not a"
372,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"philosopher. But it only shows how right I was to tell, you not to"
373,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"expect permanent relations behind the feeling of beauty, since all is"
374,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"illusion, and there is no such thing as a principle of taste, but only"
375,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"a variation of fashion."""
376,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
377,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Is it, however, quite so certain, after all, that there is no standard?"
378,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"It must be admitted that there seems to be no fixed rule of taste, not"
379,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,even a uniformity of practice or general tendency to agreement in
380,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,particular cases. But the whole study of the fine arts would lead to
381,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,despair if we allowed ourselves to accept this admission as implying
382,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,that no conceivable principle of taste exists. We may not be able to
383,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"produce it, like a yard-measure, and submit works of imagination to it,"
384,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"once and for all, in the eyes of a consternated public. But when we"
385,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"observe, as we must allow, that art is no better at one age than at"
386,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"another, but only different; that it is subject to modification, but"
387,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,certainly not to development; may we not safely accept this stationary
388,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"quality as a proof that there does exist, out of sight, unattained and"
389,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"unattainable, a positive norm of poetic beauty? We cannot define it, but"
390,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,in each generation all excellence must be the result of a relation to
391,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"it. It is the moon, heavily wrapt up in clouds, and impossible exactly"
392,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"to locate, yet revealed by the light it throws on distant portions of"
393,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"the sky. At all events, it appears to me that this is the only theory by"
394,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,which we can justify a continued interest in literature when it is
395,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"attacked, now on one side, now on another, by the vicissitudes of"
396,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,fashion.
397,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,
398,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"The essays which are here collected deal, for the most part, with"
399,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,figures in the history of English literature which have suffered from
400,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"the changes of fortune and the instability of taste. In every case,"
401,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,there has been something which is calculated to attract the sympathy and
402,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"interest of one who, like myself, has been closely concerned with two"
403,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"distinct but not unrelated branches of his subject, the literary"
404,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,character and the literary craft. More than fifty years have
405,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"passed--like a cloud, like a dream!--since I first saw my name printed"
406,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"below a passage of critical opinion. How many reputations, within that"
407,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"half-century, have not been exalted, how many have not been depressed!"
408,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,We have seen Tennyson advanced beyond Virgil and Victor Hugo beyond
409,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,Homer. We have seen the latest freak of futurism preferred to _The Lotus
410,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"Eaters_, and the first _Légende des Siècles_ rejected as unreadable. In"
411,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,face of this whirlwind of doctrine the public ceases to know whether it
412,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,"is on its head or its feet--""its trembling tent all topsy-turvy wheels,"""
413,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,as an Elizabethan has it. To me it seems that security can only be found
414,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,in an incessant exploration of the by-ways of literary history and
415,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,analysis of the vagaries of literary character. To pursue this analysis
416,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,and this exploration without bewilderment and without prejudice is to
417,ON FLUCTUATIONS OF TASTE,sum up the pleasures of a life devoted to books.

425,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
426,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
427,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Three hundred years have gone by to-day since Sir Walter Raleigh was
428,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"beheaded, in presence of a vast throng of spectators, on the scaffold of"
429,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Old Palace Yard in Westminster. General Gordon said that England is what
430,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"her adventurers have made her, and there is not in all English history a"
431,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],more shining and violent specimen of the adventurous type than Raleigh.
432,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"I am desired to deliver a brief panegyric on this celebrated freebooter,"
433,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"and I go behind the modern definition of the word ""panegyric"" (as a"
434,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"pompous and ornamented piece of rhetoric) to its original significance,"
435,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"which was, as I take it, the reminder, to a great assembly of persons,"
436,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],of the reason why they have been brought together in the name of a man
437,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"long dead. Therefore I shall endeavour, in the short space of time"
438,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"allotted to me, not so much to eulogise as to explain and to define what"
439,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Sir Walter Raleigh was and represents.
440,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
441,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"I suggest, therefore, before we touch upon any of the details of his"
442,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"career and character, that the central feature of Raleigh, as he appears"
443,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"to us after three hundred years, is his unflinching determination to see"
444,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],the name of England written across the forehead of the world. Others
445,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"before him had been patriots of the purest order, but Raleigh was the"
446,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"first man who laid it down, as a formula, that ""England shall by the"
447,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"favour of God resist, repel and confound all whatsoever attempts"
448,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"against her sacred kingdom."" He had no political sense nor skill in"
449,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"statecraft. For that we go to the Burghleys or the Cecils, crafty men of"
450,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],experience and judgment. But he understood that England had enemies and
451,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],that those enemies must be humbled and confounded. He understood that
452,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"the road of England's greatness, which was more to him than all other"
453,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"good things, lay across the sea. The time was ripe for the assertion of"
454,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"English liberty, of English ascendancy, too; and the opportunity of the"
455,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"moment lay in ""those happy hands which the Holy Ghost hath guided,"" the"
456,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],fortunate adventurers. Of these Raleigh was the most eminent as he was
457,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"also, in a sense, the most unfortunate."
458,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
459,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"A heavy shadow lay all over the Western world, the shadow of a fierce"
460,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],bird of prey hovering over its victim. Ever since Ferdinand expelled the
461,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Moors out of Granada, Spain had been nursing insensate dreams of"
462,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],universal empire. She was endeavouring to destroy the infant system of
463,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],European civilisation by every means of brutality and intrigue which the
464,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"activity of her arrogance could devise. The Kings of Spain, in their"
465,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"ruthless ambition, encouraged their people in a dream of Spanish"
466,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"world-dominion. Their bulletins had long ""filled the earth with their"
467,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"vainglorious vaunts, making great appearance of victories""; they had"
468,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"spread their propaganda ""in sundry languages in print,"" distributing"
469,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"braggart pamphlets in which they boasted, for the benefit of neutrals,"
470,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"of their successes against England, France, and Italy. They had ""abused"
471,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"and tormented"" the wretched inhabitants of the Low Countries, and they"
472,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],held that the force of arms which they brandished would weigh against
473,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"justice, humanity, and freedom in the servitude which they meant to"
474,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],inflict upon Europe. It was to be _Spanien über alles_.
475,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
476,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],But there was one particular nation against which the malignity of the
477,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],great enemy blazed most fiercely. The King of Spain blasphemously
478,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"regarded himself as the instrument of God, and there was one country"
479,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"which more than the rest frustrated his pious designs. This was England,"
480,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],and for that reason England was more bitterly hated than any other
481,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"enemy. The Spaniards did ""more greedily thirst after English blood than"
482,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"after the lives of any other people of Europe."" The avowed purpose of"
483,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Castile was to destroy that maritime supremacy of England on which the
484,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],very existence of the English State depends. The significance of Sir
485,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Walter Raleigh consists in the clairvoyance with which he perceived and
486,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],the energy with which he combated this monstrous assumption. Other noble
487,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Englishmen of his time, and before his time, had been clear-sighted and"
488,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"had struck hard against the evil tyranny of Spanish dynastic militarism,"
489,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],but no other man before or since was so luminously identified with
490,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],resistance. He struts upon the stage of battle with the limelight full
491,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],upon him. The classic writing of the crisis is contained in the _Last
492,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Fight of the Revenge at Sea_ of 1591, where the splendid defiance and"
493,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],warning of the Preface are like trumpets blown to the four quarters of
494,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"the globe. Raleigh stands out as the man who above all others laboured,"
495,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"as he said, ""against the ambitious and bloody pretences of the"
496,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Spaniards, who, seeking to devour all nations, shall be themselves"
497,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"devoured."""
498,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
499,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"There is a blessing upon the meek of the earth, but I do not present"
500,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Raleigh to you as a humble-minded man. In that wonderful Elizabethan age
501,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"there were blossoming, side by side, the meekness of Hooker, the"
502,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"subtlety of Bacon, the platonic dream of Spenser, the imperturbable"
503,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"wisdom of Shakespeare. Raleigh had no part in any of these, and to"
504,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],complain of that would be to grumble because a hollyhock is neither a
505,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],violet nor a rose. He had his enemies during his life and his detractors
506,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"ever since, and we may go so far as to admit that he deserves them. He"
507,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"was a typical man of that heroic age in that he possessed, even to"
508,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"excess, all its tropic irregularity of ethics. He lived in a perpetual"
509,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],alternation of thunderstorm and blazing sunshine. He admitted himself
510,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"that his ""reason,"" by which he meant his judgment, ""was exceeding weak,"""
511,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],and his tactlessness constantly precluded a due appreciation of his
512,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],courage and nobility. For long years his violent and haughty temper made
513,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"him the most unpopular man in England, except in Devonshire, where"
514,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"everybody doted on him. He was ""a man of desperate fortunes,"" and he did"
515,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"not shrink from violent methods. In studying his life we are amused, we"
516,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"are almost scandalised, at his snake-like quality. He moves with"
517,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"serpentine undulations, and the beautiful hard head is lifted from"
518,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],ambush to strike the unsuspecting enemy at sight. With his
519,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"protestations, his volubility, his torrent of excuses, his evasive"
520,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"pertinacity, Sir Walter Raleigh is the very opposite of the ""strong"
521,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"silent"" type of soldier which the nineteenth century invented for"
522,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],exclusive British consumption.
523,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
524,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],In judging his character we must take into consideration not only the
525,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"times in which he lived, but the leaders of English policy with whom he"
526,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"came into collision. He was not thirty years of age, and still at the"
527,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"height of his vivacity, when he was taken into the close favour of Queen"
528,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Elizabeth. There can be no question that he found in the temper of the
529,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],monarch something to which his own nature intimately responded. The
530,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Queen was an adventurer at heart, as he was, and she was an Englishman"
531,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],of Englishmen. We are accustomed to laugh at the extravagance of the
532,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"homage which Raleigh paid to a woman old enough to be his mother, at the"
533,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],bravado which made him fling his new plush cloak across a puddle for the
534,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Queen to tread over gently, as Fuller tells us, ""rewarding him"
535,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],afterwards with many suits for his so free and seasonable tender of so
536,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"fair a footcloth,"" or at the story of the rhymes the couple cut on the"
537,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"glass with their diamond rings. In all this, no doubt, there was the"
538,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"fashion of the time, and on Raleigh's part there was ambition and the"
539,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"desire to push his fortunes without scruple. But there was, you may be"
540,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"sure, more than that; there was the instinctive sympathy between the two"
541,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],who hated with the most unflagging and the most burning hate the wicked
542,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],aggression of Spain. We may be sure that Elizabeth never for a day
543,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],forgot that Pope Alexander VI. had generously bestowed the Western world
544,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],on the Crown of Spain. Raleigh spoke a language which might be
545,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"extravagant and which might be exasperating, which might, in fact, lead"
546,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"to outrageous quarrels between his Cynthia and himself, but which, at"
547,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"least, that Cynthia understood."
548,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
549,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"But in 1602, when Raleigh was fifty years of age and had his splendours"
550,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"behind him, there came another Pharaoh who knew not Joseph. James I. was"
551,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"the type of the cautious man who only looks to the present, who hopes by"
552,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"staving off a crisis till Tuesday that something fresh will ""turn up"" by"
553,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Wednesday. He was disposed, from the very first, to distrust and to"
554,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"waylay the plans of Raleigh. We are told, and can well believe it, that"
555,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"he was ""diffident"" of Sir Walter's designs. He was uncomfortable in the"
556,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"presence of that breezy ""man of desperate fortunes."" A very excellent"
557,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],example of the opposition of the two types is offered by the discussion
558,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"about the golden city of Manoa. Raleigh believed, and after all"
559,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"disappointments continued to be sure, that in the heart of the swamps of"
560,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"the Orinoco there existed a citadel of magnificent wealth, an emporium"
561,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"of diamonds and gold, from which Spain was secretly drawing the riches"
562,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],with which she proposed to overwhelm civilisation. He struggled for
563,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],nearly a quarter of a century to win this marvellous city for England.
564,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"James I. chopped in with his cold logic, and declined to believe that"
565,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"any golden mine existed in Guiana ""anywhere in nature,"" as he craftily"
566,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],said. When Raleigh returned after his last miserable failure in May
567,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"1617, the monarch spared no sneer and no reproof to the pirate of the"
568,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"seas. Of course, the King was right; there was no mine of diamonds, no"
569,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],golden city. But the immense treasures that haunted Raleigh's dreams
570,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],were more real than reality; they existed in the future; he looked far
571,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"ahead, and our sympathies to-day, and our gratitude also, are all for"
572,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],the noble and valorous knight who sailed out into the West searching for
573,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],an unknown El Dorado.
574,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
575,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"It is not so easy to defend the character of our hero against those who,"
576,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"like Hume, have objected to his methods in the prosecution of his"
577,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"designs. To Hume, as to many others before and since, Raleigh seemed"
578,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"""extremely defective either in solid understanding, or morals, or both."""
579,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],The excellent historians of the eighteenth century could not make up
580,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],their minds whether he was a hero or an impostor. Did he believe in the
581,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Guiana mine, or was he, through all those strenuous years, hoodwinking"
582,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"the world? Had he any purpose, save to plunder the Spaniard? Perhaps his"
583,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"own family doubted his sanity, for his son Walter, when he charged the"
584,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Spanish settlement at San Thomé, pointed to the house of the little"
585,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"colony and shouted to his men: ""Come on, this is the true mine, and none"
586,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"but fools would look for any other!"" Accusations of bad faith, of"
587,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"factious behaviour, of disloyal intrigue, were brought up against Sir"
588,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Walter over and over again during the ""day of his tempestuous life,"
589,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"drawn on into an evening"" of ignominy and blood. These charges were the"
590,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"""inmost and soul-piercing wounds"" of which he spoke, still ""aching,"""
591,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"still ""uncured."""
592,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
593,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"There is no need to recount to you the incidents of his life, but I may"
594,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],remind you that after the failure of the latest expedition to South
595,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"America the Privy Council, under pressure from the Spanish Ambassador,"
596,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],gave orders to Sir Lewis Stukeley to bring the body of Sir Walter
597,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Raleigh speedily to London. This was the culmination of his fall, since,"
598,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"three days after Raleigh landed at Plymouth, the King had assured Spain"
599,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"that ""not all those who have given security for Raleigh can save him"
600,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"from the gallows."" His examination followed, and the publication of the"
601,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"_Apology for the Voyage to Guiana_. The trial dragged on, while James"
602,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"I., in a manner almost inconceivable, allowed himself to be hurried and"
603,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],bullied by the insolent tyrant Philip II. If the English King did not
604,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],make haste to execute Raleigh the Spaniards would fetch him away and
605,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"hang him in Madrid. In these conditions, and clutching at life as a man"
606,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"clutches at roots and branches when he is sliding down a precipice, the"
607,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],conduct of Raleigh has given cause to his critics to blaspheme. He
608,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"wriggled like an eel, he pretended to be sick, he pretended to be mad,"
609,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"in order to protract his examination. He prevaricated about his mine,"
610,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"about the French alliance, about the Spanish treaties, about his stores"
611,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"and instruments. Did he believe, or did he not believe, in the Empire of"
612,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"the Inca, in the Amazons or Republic of Women, in the gold lying hidden"
613,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"in the hard white spar of El Dorado? We do not know, and his own latest"
614,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],efforts at explanation only cloud our counsel. He was perhaps really a
615,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"little mad at last, his feverish brain half-crazed by the movement on"
616,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],land and sea of the triumphant wealth of Spain.
617,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
618,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Let us never overlook that the master-passion of his whole career was
619,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],hatred of this tyrannous prosperity of England's most formidable rival.
620,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"He acted impulsively, and even unjustly; there was much in his methods"
621,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"that a cool judgment must condemn; but he was fighting, with his back to"
622,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"the wall, in order that the British race should not be crowded out of"
623,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"existence by ""the proud Iberian."" He saw that if Spain were permitted to"
624,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"extend her military and commercial supremacy unchecked, there would be"
625,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"an end to civilisation. Democracy was a thing as yet undeveloped, but"
626,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"the seeds of it were lying in the warm soil of English liberty, and"
627,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Raleigh perceived, more vehemently than any other living man, that the"
628,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],complete victory of Spain would involve the shipwreck of England's hopes
629,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"of future prosperity. Nor was he exclusively interested in England,"
630,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],though all his best hopes were ours. When he had been a lad at Oxford he
631,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],had broken away from his studies in 1569 to help the Protestant princes
632,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"as a gentleman volunteer in France, and he took part in the famous"
633,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],battle of Jarnac. He is supposed to have fought in France for six years.
634,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"From early youth his mind was ""bent on military glory,"" and always in"
635,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],opposition to Spain. His escape from the bloody Vespers of Saint
636,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Bartholomew had given him a deep distrust of the policy of Rome. The
637,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Spaniard had ""abused and tormented"" the wretched inhabitants of"
638,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Flanders. Sir Walter Raleigh dreamed that by the combination in arms of
639,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"England, France, and the Low Countries, the Spaniards ""might not only be"
640,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"persuaded to live in peace, but all their swelling and overflowing"
641,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],streams might be brought back into their natural channels and old
642,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"banks."""
643,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
644,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Raleigh stood out, as he put it himself, against ""the continuance of"
645,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"this boundless ambition in mortal men."" The rulers in Madrid,"
646,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"transported by their own arrogance, had determined to impose their"
647,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"religion, their culture, their form of government, on the world. It was"
648,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],a question whether the vastly superior moral and intellectual energy of
649,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],England and France would not be crushed beneath the heel of Spain.
650,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Raleigh was ready to sacrifice everything, to imperil his own soul, to"
651,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"prevent that. He says you might as well ""root out the Christian religion"
652,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"altogether"" as join ""the rest of all Europe to Spain."" In his zeal to"
653,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"prevent ""the continuance of this boundless ambition in mortal men,"" he"
654,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],lent himself to acts which we must not attempt to condone. There is no
655,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],use in trying to explain away the facts of his cruel and even savage
656,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],fanaticism in Ireland when he was governor of Munster. He was always apt
657,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],to be abruptly brutal to a man who crossed his path. But even his Irish
658,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],career offers aspects on which we may dwell with pure pleasure. Nothing
659,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"could be more romantic than those adventures, like the feats of a"
660,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"paladin of the Faerie Queen, which he encountered in the great wood of"
661,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Lismore; while the story of how he carried off Lord and Lady Roche from
662,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"their breakfast-table in their own castle of Ballyinharsh, and how he"
663,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],rode with them up ravines and round precipices in that mad flight from
664,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"their retainers, is as rousing as any scene ever imagined by Dumas"
665,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],_père_.
666,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
667,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Raleigh called himself the Shepherd of the Ocean, and the name fits him"
668,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"well, even though his flock were less like sheep than like a leash of"
669,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],hunting leopards. His theory was that with a pack of small and active
670,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],pinnaces he could successfully hunt the lumbering Spanish galleons
671,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"without their being able to hit back. He was, in contradistinction to"
672,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"many preceding English admirals, a cautious fighter at sea, and he says,"
673,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"in a striking passage of the _History of the World_, written towards the"
674,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"end of his career, ""to clap ships together without any consideration"
675,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"belongs rather to a madman than to a man of war."" He must have taken the"
676,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],keenest interest in the gigantic failure of the Felicissima Armada in
677,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"1588, but, tantalisingly enough, we have no record of his part in it. On"
678,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"the other hand, the two finest of his prose pamphlets, the _Relation of"
679,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],the Action in Cadiz Harbour_ and the incomparable _Report on the Fight
680,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"in the Revenge_, supply us with ample materials for forming an idea of"
681,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"his value as a naval strategist. Raleigh's earliest biographer, Oldys"
682,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"the antiquary, speaks of him as ""raising a grove of laurels out of the"
683,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"sea,"" and it is certainly upon that element that he reaches his highest"
684,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],effect of prominence. It was at sea that he could give fullest scope to
685,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],his hatred of the tyrannous prosperity of Spain. He had to be at once a
686,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],gamekeeper and a poacher; he had to protect the legitimate interests of
687,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"English shipping against privateers and pirates, while he was persuaded"
688,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"to be, or felt himself called upon to become, no little of a pirate"
689,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"himself. He was a passionate advocate of the freedom of the seas, and"
690,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],those who look upon Raleigh as a mere hot-brained enthusiast should read
691,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"his little book called _Observations on Trade and Commerce_, written in"
692,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"the Tower, and see what sensible views he had about the causes of the"
693,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"depression of trade. These sage opinions did not check him, or his"
694,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"fleets of hunting-pinnaces, from lying in wait for the heavy wallowing"
695,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"plate-ships, laden with Indian carpets and rubies and sandalwood and"
696,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"ebony, which came swinging up to the equator from Ceylon or Malabar. The"
697,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"""freedom of the seas"" was for Raleigh's ship, the _Roebuck_; it was by"
698,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],no means for the _Madre de Dios_. We find these moral inconsistencies in
699,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],the mind of the best of adventurers.
700,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
701,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],A sketch of Raleigh's character would be imperfect indeed if it
702,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],contained no word concerning his genius as a coloniser. One of his main
703,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"determinations, early in life, was ""to discover and conquer unknown"
704,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"lands, and take possession of them in the Queen's name."" We celebrate in"
705,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Sir Walter Raleigh one of the most intelligent and imaginative of the
706,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],founders of our colonial empire. The English merchantmen before his time
707,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],had been satisfied with the determination to grasp the wealth of the New
708,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],World as it came home to Spain; it had not occurred to them to compete
709,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],with the great rival at the fountain-head of riches. Even men like Drake
710,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"and Frobisher had been content with a policy of forbidding Spain, as the"
711,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"poet Wither said, ""to check our ships from sailing where they please."""
712,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"South America was already mainly in Spanish hands, but North America was"
713,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"still open to invasion. It was Raleigh's half-brother, Sir Humphrey"
714,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Gilbert, who first thought of planting an English settlement in what is"
715,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"now the United States, in 1578. But Gilbert had ""no luck at sea,"" as"
716,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Queen Elizabeth observed, and it was Raleigh who, in 1584, took up the"
717,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"scheme of colonisation. He did not drop it until the death of Elizabeth,"
718,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"when, under the east wind of the new _régime_, the blossom of his"
719,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],colonial enterprises flagged.
720,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
721,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],The motion for the ceremony of to-day originated with the authorities of
722,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"an important American city, which proudly bears the name of our"
723,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],adventurer. The earliest settlement in what are now the United States
724,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"was made at Roanoke, in Virginia, on a day which must always be"
725,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"prominent in the annals of civilisation, August 17th, 1585. But this"
726,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"colony lasted only ten months, and it was not until nearly two years"
727,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],later that the fourth expedition which Raleigh sent out succeeded in
728,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],maintaining a perilous foothold in the new country. This was the little
729,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"trembling taper to which his own name was given, the twinkling spark"
730,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],which is now the flourishing city of Raleigh in North Carolina. We may
731,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"well marvel at the pertinacity with which Sir Walter persisted, in the"
732,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"face of innumerable difficulties, in sending out one colonising fleet"
733,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"after another, although, contrary to common legend, he himself never set"
734,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],foot in North America. It was fortunate that at this period of his
735,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"career he was wealthy, for the attempts to plant settlements in the vast"
736,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"region which he named Virginia cost him more than £40,000. We note at"
737,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"all turns of his fortune his extraordinary tenacity of purpose, which he"
738,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"illustrated, as though by a motto, in the verses he addressed to a"
739,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],comrade towards the end of his imprisonment in the Tower:--
740,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
741,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"""Change not! to change thy fortune 'tis too late;"
742,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],Who with a manly faith resolves to die
743,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"May promise to himself a lasting State,"
744,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Though not so great, yet free from infamy."""
745,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
746,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"So we may think of him in his prime, as he stood on the Hoe of Plymouth"
747,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"twenty years before, a gallant figure of a man, bedizened with precious"
748,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"stones, velvets, and embroidered damasks, shouting his commands to his"
749,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],captains in a strong Devonshire accent. We think of him resolutely
750,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"gazing westward always, with the light of the sea in his eyes."
751,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
752,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],We come to the final scene which we are here to-day to commemorate.
753,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Little honour to the rulers of England in 1618 redounds from it, and yet"
754,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],we may feel that it completed and even redeemed from decay the character
755,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"of Raleigh. This tragedy, which was almost a murder, was needed to round"
756,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],off the accomplishment of so strange and frantic a career of romantic
757,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"violence, and to stamp it with meaning. If Raleigh had been thrown from"
758,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"his horse or had died of the ague in his bed, we should have been"
759,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"depressed by the squalid circumstances, we should have been less"
760,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],conscious than we are now of his unbroken magnanimity. His failures and
761,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"his excesses had made him unpopular throughout England, and he was both"
762,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],proud and peevish in his recognition of the fact. He declared that he
763,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"was ""nothing indebted"" to the world, and again that, ""the common people"
764,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"are evil judges of honest things."" But the thirteen years of his"
765,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],imprisonment caused a reaction. People forgot how troublesome he had
766,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],been and only recollected his magnificence. They remembered nothing but
767,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],that he had spent his whole energy and fortune in resisting the
768,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],brutality and avarice of the Spaniard.
769,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],
770,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Then came the disgraceful scene of his cross-examination at Westminster,"
771,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],and the condemnation by his venal judges at the order of a paltry king.
772,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"It became known, or shrewdly guessed, that Spain had sent to James I. a"
773,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],hectoring alternative that Raleigh must be executed in London or sent
774,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],alive for a like purpose to Madrid. The trial was a cowardly and
775,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],ignominious submission of the English Government to the insolence of
776,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],England's hereditary enemy. Raleigh seemed for the moment to have failed
777,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"completely, yet it was really like the act of Samson, who slew more men"
778,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"at his death than in all his life. Samuel Pepys, who had some fine"
779,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"intuitions at a time when the national _moral_ was very low, spoke of"
780,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"Raleigh as being ""given over, as a sacrifice,"" to our enemies. This has"
781,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],"been, in truth, the secret of his unfailing romantic popularity, and it"
782,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],is the reason of the emotion which has called us together here three
783,THE SHEPHERD OF THE OCEAN[1],hundred years after his death upon the scaffold.

794,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Among the ""co-supremes and stars of love"" which form the constellated"
795,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,glory of our greatest poet there is one small splendour which we are apt
796,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"to overlook in our general survey. But, if we isolate it from other"
797,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"considerations, it is surely no small thing that Shakespeare created and"
798,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,introduced into our literature the Dramatic Song. If with statistical
799,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"finger we turn the pages of all his plays, we shall discover, not"
800,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"perhaps without surprise, that these contain not fewer than fifty"
801,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"strains of lyrical measure. Some of the fifty, to be sure, are mere"
802,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"star-dust, but others include some of the very jewels of our tongue."
803,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,They range in form from the sophisticated quatorzains of _The Two
804,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Gentlemen of Verona_ (where, however, comes ""Who is Silvia?"") to the"
805,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,reckless snatches of melody in _Hamlet_. But all have a character which
806,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"is Shakespearean, and this regardless of the question so often raised,"
807,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"and so incapable of reply, as to whether some of the wilder ones are"
808,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,Shakespeare's composition or no. Whoever originally may have written
809,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"such scraps as ""They bore him bare-faced on the bier"" and ""Come o'er the"
810,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"bourne, Bessy, to me,"" the spirit of Shakespeare now pervades and"
811,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,possesses them.
812,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,
813,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,Our poet was a prodigious innovator in this as in so many other matters.
814,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Of course, the idea and practice of musical interludes in plays was not"
815,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,quite novel. In Shakespeare's early youth that remarkable artist in
816,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"language, John Lyly, had presented songs in several of his plays, and"
817,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"these were notable for what his contemporary, Henry Upchear, called"
818,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"""their labouring beauty."" We may notice that Lyly's songs were not"
819,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"printed till long after Shakespeare's death, but doubtless he had"
820,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"listened to them. Peele and Greene had brilliant lyrical gifts, but they"
821,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"did not exercise them in their dramas, nor did Lodge, whose novel of"
822,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,Rosalynde (1590) contains the only two precedent songs which we could
823,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,willingly add to Shakespeare's juvenile repertory. But while I think it
824,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,would be rash to deny that the lyrics of Lodge and Lyly had their direct
825,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"influence on the style of Shakespeare, neither of those admirable"
826,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,precursors conceived the possibility of making the Song an integral part
827,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"of the development of the drama. This was Shakespeare's invention, and"
828,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,he applied it with a technical adroitness which had never been dreamed
829,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,of before and was never rivalled after.
830,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,
831,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"This was not apprehended by the early critics of our divine poet, and"
832,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"has never yet, perhaps, received all the attention it deserves. We may"
833,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,find ourselves bewildered if we glance at what the eighteenth-century
834,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"commentators said, for instance, about the songs in _Twelfth Night_."
835,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"They called the adorable rhapsodies of the Clown ""absurd"" and"
836,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"""unintelligible""; ""O Mistress mine"" was in their ears ""meaningless"";"
837,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"""When that I was"" appeared to them ""degraded buffoonery."" They did not"
838,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,perceive the close and indispensable connection between the Clown's song
839,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"and the action of the piece, although the poet had been careful to point"
840,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"out that it was a moral song ""dulcet in contagion,"" and too good, except"
841,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"for sarcasm, to be wasted on Sir Andrew and Sir Toby. The critics"
842,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"neglected to note what the Duke says about ""Come away, come away,"
843,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Death,"" and they prattled in their blindness as to whether this must not"
844,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"really have been sung by Viola, all the while insensible to the poignant"
845,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,dramatic value of it as warbled by the ironic Clown in the presence of
846,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,the blinded pair. But indeed the whole of _Twelfth Night_ is burdened

852,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Rather different, and perhaps still more subtle, is the case of _A"
853,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Winter's Tale_, where the musical obsession is less prominent, and where"
854,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,the songs are all delivered from the fantastic lips of Autolycus. Here
855,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"again the old critics were very wonderful. Dr. Burney puts ""When"
856,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"daffodils begin to peer"" and ""Lawn as white as driven snow"" into one"
857,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"bag, and flings it upon the dust-heap, as ""two nonsensical songs"" sung"
858,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"by ""a pickpocket."" Dr. Warburton blushed to think that such ""nonsense"""
859,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,could be foisted on Shakespeare's text. Strange that those learned men
860,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"were unable to see, not merely that the rogue-songs are intensely human"
861,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"and pointedly Shakespearean, but that they are an integral part of the"
862,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,drama. They complete the revelation of the complex temperament of
863,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Autolycus, with his passion for flowers and millinery, his hysterical"
864,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"balancing between laughter and tears, his impish mendacity, his sudden"
865,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"sentimentality, like the Clown's"

870,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,It is in these subtle lyrical amalgams of humour and tenderness that the
871,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,firm hand of the creator of character reveals itself.
872,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,
873,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,But it is in _The Tempest_ that Shakespeare's supremacy as a writer of
874,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"songs is most brilliantly developed. Here are seven or eight lyrics, and"
875,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,among them are some of the loveliest things that any man has written.
876,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"What was ever composed more liquid, more elastic, more delicately"
877,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,fairy-like than Ariel's First Song?
878,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,
879,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"""Come unto these yellow sands,"
880,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,And then take hands:
881,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Curtsied when you have, and kiss'd,--"
882,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"The wild waves whist."""
883,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,
884,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"That is, not ""kissed the wild waves,"" as ingenious punctuators pretend,"

886,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"the while."" Even fairies do not kiss waves, than which no embrace could"
887,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,be conceived less rewarding. Has any one remarked the echo of Marlowe
888,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"here, from _Hero and Leander_,"
889,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,
890,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"""when all is whist and still,"
891,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,Save that the sea playing on yellow sand
892,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Sends forth a rattling murmur to the land!"""
893,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,
894,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"But Marlowe, with all his gifts, could never have written the lyrical"
895,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,parts of _The Tempest_. This song is in emotional sympathy with
896,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Ferdinand, and in the truest sense dramatic, not a piece of pretty verse"
897,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,foisted in to add to the entertainment.
898,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,
899,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Ariel's Second Song has been compared with Webster's ""Call for the robin"
900,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"redbreast"" in _The White Devil_, but solemn as Webster's dirge is, it"
901,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"tolls, it docs not sing to us. Shakespeare's ""ditty,"" as Ferdinand calls"
902,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"it, is like a breath of the west wind over an æolian harp. Where, in any"
903,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"language, has ease of metre triumphed more adorably than in Ariel's"
904,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Fourth Song,--""Where the bee sucks""? Dowden saw in Ariel the imaginative"
905,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"genius of English poetry, recently delivered from Sycorax. If we glance"
906,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,at Dry den's recension of _The Tempest_ we may be inclined to think that
907,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"the ""wicked dam"" soon won back her mastery. With all respect to Dryden,"
908,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,what are we to think of his discretion in eking out Shakespeare's
909,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,insufficiencies with such staves as this:--
910,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,
911,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"""Upon the floods we'll sing and play"
912,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,And celebrate a halcyon day;
913,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Great Nephew Aeolus make no noise,"
914,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Muzzle your roaring boys."""
915,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,
916,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,and so forth? What had happened to the ear of England in seventy years?
917,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,
918,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,As a matter of fact the perfection of dramatic song scarcely survived
919,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Shakespeare himself. The early Jacobeans, Heywood, Ford, and Dekker in"
920,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"particular, broke out occasionally in delicate ditties. But most"
921,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"playwrights, like Massinger, were persistently pedestrian. The only man"
922,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"who came at all close to Shakespeare as a lyrist was John Fletcher,"
923,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"whose ""Lay a garland on my hearse"" nobody could challenge if it were"
924,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,found printed first in a Shakespeare quarto. The three great songs in
925,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"""Valentinian"" have almost more splendour than any of Shakespeare's,"
926,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"though never quite the intimate beauty, the singing spontaneity of"
927,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"""Under the greenwood tree"" or ""Hark, hark, the lark."" It has grown to be"
928,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"the habit of anthologists to assert Shakespeare's right to ""Roses, their"
929,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"sharp spikes being gone."" The mere fact of its loveliness and perfection"
930,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,gives them no authority to do so; and to my ear the rather stately
931,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,procession of syllables is reminiscent of Fletcher. We shall never be
932,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"certain; and who would not swear that ""Hear, ye ladies that are coy"" was"
933,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"by the same hand that wrote ""Sigh no more, ladies,"" if we were not sure"
934,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"of the contrary? But the most effective test, even in the case of"
935,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Fletcher, is to see whether the trill of song is, or is not, an inherent"
936,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,portion of the dramatic structure of the play. This is the hall-mark of
937,THE SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE,"Shakespeare, and perhaps of him alone."

948,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,tropical and profuse literature of the early and middle seventeenth
949,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,century has often been observed with wonder. While France had her
950,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Madeleine de Scudéry and her Mlle. de Gournay and her Mère Angelique
951,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Arnauld, Englishwomen of the Stuart age ventured upon no incursions into"
952,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"philosophy, fiction, or theology. More and more eagerly, however, they"
953,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"read books; and as a consequence of reading, they began at last to"
954,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"write. The precious Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle, hob-a-nobbed with"
955,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,every Muse in her amazing divagations. But the earliest professional
956,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"woman of letters was Aphra Behn, the novelist and playwright, to whose"
957,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,genius justice has only quite lately been done by Mr. Montague Summers.
958,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Mrs. Behn died in 1689, and it seemed at first that she had left no"
959,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,heritage to her sex. But there presently appeared a set of female
960,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"writers, who enlivened the last years of the century, but who were soon"
961,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"eclipsed by the wits of the age of Anne, and who have been entirely"
962,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"forgotten. It is to the most interesting of these ""transient phantoms"""
963,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,that I wish to draw attention.
964,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
965,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,The extreme precocity of Catharine Trotter makes her seem to belong to
966,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"the age of Dryden, but she was in reality younger than Addison and most"
967,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of the other contemporaries of Pope. She was born on August 16th, 1679,"
968,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"the younger daughter of a naval officer, Captain David Trotter, R.N.;"
969,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"her mother's maiden name had been Sarah Ballenden, probably of the"
970,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"well-known Catholic family of that ilk. She ""had the honour of being"
971,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"nearly related to the illustrious families of Maitland, Duke of"
972,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Lauderdale and Drummond, Earl of Perth."" The Jacobite fourth Earl of"
973,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Perth seems to have been the patron of Captain Trotter, of whom he wrote"
974,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"in 1684 that he was ""an ornament to his country."" Apparently the gallant"
975,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"captain was attached to Trinity House, where his probity and integrity"
976,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"earned him the epithet of ""honest David,"" and where he attracted the"
977,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"notice of George, first Lord Dartmouth, when that rising statesman was"
978,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"appointed Master. Captain Trotter had served the Crown from his youth,"
979,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""with great gallantry and fidelity, both by land and sea,"" and had been"
980,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,very successful in the Dutch wars. He had a brother who was a commander
981,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"in the Navy. We get an impression of high respectability in the outer,"
982,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"but not outermost, circles of influential Scottish society. Doubtless"
983,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,the infancy of Catharine was spent in conditions of dependent
984,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,prosperity. These conditions were not to last. When she was four years
985,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"old Lord Dartmouth started on the famous expedition to demolish Tangier,"
986,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"and he took Captain Trotter with him as his commodore. In this affair,"
987,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"as before, the captain distinguished himself by his ability, and instead"
988,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,of returning to London after Tangier he was recommended to King Charles
989,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,II. as the proper person to convoy the fleet of the Turkey Company to
990,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,its destination. Apparently it was understood that this would be the
991,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"final reward of his services and that he was to ""make his fortune"" out"
992,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of the Turks. Unhappily, after convoying his charge safely to"
993,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Scanderoon, he fell sick of the plague that was raging there, and died,"
994,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"in the course of January 1684, in company with all the other officers of"
995,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"his ship. Every misfortune now ensued; the purser, who was thus left to"
996,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"his own devices, helped himself to the money destined for the expenses"
997,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of the voyage, while, to crown all, the London goldsmith in whose hands"
998,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,the captain had left his private fortune took this occasion to go
999,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"bankrupt. The King, in these melancholy circumstances, granted an"
1000,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Admiralty pension to the widow, but when he died early in the following"
1001,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"year this was no longer paid, and the unfortunate ladies of the Trotter"
1002,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,family might well murmur:--
1003,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1004,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""One mischief brings another on his neck,"
1005,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"As mighty billows tumble in the seas."""
1006,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1007,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"From the beginning of her fifth year, then, Catharine experienced the"
1008,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,precarious lot of those who depend for a livelihood on the charity of
1009,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,more or less distant relatives. We dimly see a presentable mother
1010,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,piteously gathering up such crumbs as fell from the tables of the
1011,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,illustrious families with whom she was remotely connected. But the Duke
1012,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of Lauderdale himself was now dead, and the Earl of Perth had passed the"
1013,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,zenith of his power. No doubt in the seventeenth century the protection
1014,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of poor relations was carried on more systematically than it is to-day,"
1015,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,and certainly Mrs. Trotter contrived to live and to bring up her two
1016,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,daughters genteelly. The first years were the worst; the accession of
1017,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"William III. brought back to England and to favour Gilbert Burnet, who"
1018,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"became Bishop of Salisbury in 1688, when Catharine was nine years old."
1019,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Mrs. Trotter found a patron and perhaps an employer in the Bishop, and"
1020,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,when Queen Anne came to the throne her little pension was renewed.
1021,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1022,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"There is frequent reference to money in Catharine Trotter's writings,"
1023,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,and the lack of it was the rock upon which her gifts were finally
1024,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,wrecked. With a competency she might have achieved a much more prominent
1025,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,place in English literature than she could ever afford to reach. She
1026,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"offers a curious instance of the depressing effect of poverty, and we"
1027,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"get the impression that she was never, during her long and virtuous"
1028,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"career, lifted above the carking anxiety which deadens the imagination."
1029,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"As a child, however, she seems to have awakened hopes of a high order."
1030,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"She was a prodigy, and while little more than an infant she displayed an"
1031,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"illumination in literature which was looked upon, in that age of female"
1032,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"darkness, as quite a portent. She taught herself French, ""by her own"
1033,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"application without any instructor,"" but was obliged to accept some"
1034,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,assistance in acquiring Latin and logic. The last-mentioned subject
1035,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"became her particular delight, and at a very tender age she drew up ""an"
1036,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"abstract"" of that science ""for her own use."" Thus she prepared for her"
1037,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"future communion with Locke and with Leibnitz. When she was very small,"
1038,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,in spite of frequent conferences with learned members of the Church of
1039,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"England, she became persuaded of the truth of Catholicism and joined the"
1040,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Roman communion. We may conjecture that this coincided with the
1041,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"conversion of her kinsman, Lord Chancellor Perth, but as events turned"
1042,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"out it cannot but have added to the sorrows of that much-tried woman,"
1043,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,her mother. (It should be stated that Catharine resumed the Anglican
1044,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,faith when she was twenty-eight years of age.)
1045,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1046,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,She was in her tenth year when the unhappy reign of James II. came to a
1047,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,close. Mrs. Trotter's connections were now in a poor plight. The new
1048,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Earl of Lauderdale was in great distress for money; Lord Dartmouth,"
1049,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"abandoned by the King in his flight, was thrown into the Tower, where he"
1050,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"died on October 25th, 1691, in which year the estates of the Earl of"
1051,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Perth were sequestered and he himself hunted out of the country. Ruin
1052,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"simultaneously fell on all the fine friends of our infant prodigy, and"
1053,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,we can but guess how it affected her. Yet there were plenty of other
1054,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Jacobites left in London, and Catharine's first public appearance shows"
1055,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,that she cultivated their friendship. She published in 1693 a copy of
1056,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,verses addressed to Mr. Bevil Higgons on the occasion of his recovery
1057,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,from the smallpox; she was then fourteen years of age. Higgons was a
1058,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"young man of twenty-three, who had lately returned from the exiled court"
1059,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"in France, where he had distinguished himself by his agreeable manners,"
1060,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,and who had just made a name for himself by poems addressed to Dryden
1061,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,and by a prologue to Congreve's _Old Batchelor_. He was afterwards to
1062,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,become famous for a little while as a political historian. Catharine
1063,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Trotter's verses are bad, but she addresses Higgons as ""lovely youth,"""
1064,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,and claims his gratitude for her tribute in terms which are almost
1065,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"boisterous. This poem was not only her introduction to the public, but,"
1066,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"through Bevil Higgons, was probably the channel of her acquaintance with"
1067,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Congreve and Dryden.
1068,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1069,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Throughout her life she was fond of writing letters to celebrated
1070,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,people; she now certainly wrote to Congreve and doubtless to Dryden. A
1071,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,freedom in correspondence ran in the family. Her poor mother is revealed
1072,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"to us as always ""renewing her application"" to somebody or other. We next"
1073,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"find the youthful poet in relation with the Earl of Dorset, from whom"
1074,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,she must have concealed her Jacobite propensities. Dorset was the great
1075,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"public patron of poetry under William III., and Catharine Trotter, aged"
1076,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"sixteen, having composed a tragedy, appealed to him for support. It was"
1077,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"very graciously granted, and _Agnes de Castro_, in five acts and in"
1078,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"blank verse, ""written by a young lady,"" was produced at the Theatre"
1079,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Royal in 1695, under the ""protection"" of Charles Earl of Dorset and"
1080,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Middlesex, Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's Household. The event caused"
1081,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,a considerable commotion. No woman had written for the English stage
1082,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"since the death of Mrs. Behn, and curiosity was much excited. Mrs."
1083,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Verbruggen, that enchanting actress, but in male attire, recited a"
1084,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"clever, ranting epilogue at the close of the performance, in which she"
1085,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,said:--
1086,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1087,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""'tis whispered here"
1088,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Our Poetess is virtuous, young and fair,"""
1089,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1090,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"but the secret was an open one. Wycherley, who contributed verses, knew"
1091,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"all about it, and so did Mrs. Manley, while Powell and Colley Cibber"
1092,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,were among the actors. We may be sure that little Mistress Trotter's
1093,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,surprising talents were the subjects of much discussion at Will's Coffee
1094,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"House, and that the question of securing her for the rival theatre was"
1095,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,anxiously debated at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Her success in Agnes de
1096,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Castro was the principal asset which Drury Lane had to set that season
1097,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,against Congreve's splendid adventure with Love for Love.
1098,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1099,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Agnes de Castro is an immature production, and shows a juvenile"
1100,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"insensibility to plagiarism, since the subject and treatment are"
1101,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"borrowed implicitly from a French novel by Mlle. de Brillac, published"
1102,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,in Paris and London a few years before.[2] The conception of court life
1103,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"at Coimbra in the fourteenth century is that of this French lady, and is"
1104,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"innocent of Portuguese local colour. But, as the dramatic work of a girl"
1105,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of sixteen, the play is rather extraordinary for nimble movement and"
1106,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,adroit theatrical arrangements. It is evident that Catharine Trotter was
1107,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"well versed in the stage traditions of her own day, and we may wonder"
1108,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,how a highly respectable girl of sixteen found her opportunity. The
1109,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"English playhouse under William III. was no place for a very young lady,"
1110,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,even if she wore a mask. There is a good deal of meritorious
1111,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,character-drawing in Agnes de Castro. The conception of a benevolent and
1112,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,tenderly forgiving Princess is well contrasted with the fierce purity of
1113,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Agnes and the infatuation of the Prince. Towards the close of the first
1114,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,act there is a capital scene of exquisite confusion between this
1115,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"generous and distracted trio. The opening of the third act, between"
1116,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Elvira and her brother Alvaro, is not at all young-ladyish, and has some"
1117,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"strong turns of feeling. The end of the play, with the stabbing of the"
1118,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Princess and the accusation of Agnes by Elvira, is puerile, but was"
1119,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"doubtless welcome to a sentimental audience. It is a bad play, but not"
1120,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,at all an unpromising one.
1121,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1122,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Early in 1696 _Agnes de Castro_, still anonymous, was published as a"
1123,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"book, and for the next five or six years we find Catharine Trotter"
1124,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,habitually occupied in writing for the stage. Without question she did
1125,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"so professionally, though in what way dramatists at the close of the"
1126,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,seventeenth century lived by their pens is difficult to conjecture. A
1127,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"very rare play, _The Female Wits; or, the Triumvirate of Poets_, the"
1128,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"authorship of which has hitherto defied conjecture, was acted at Drury"
1129,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Lane after Catharine Trotter had been tempted across to Lincoln's Inn
1130,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Fields, and is evidently inspired by the intense jealousy which"
1131,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,smouldered between the two great houses. The success of Miss Trotter
1132,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,incited two older ladies to compete with her; these were Mrs.
1133,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Delariviere Manley, who was a discarded favourite of Barbara Villiers,"
1134,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"and fat Mrs. Mary Pix, the stage-struck consort of a tailor. These"
1135,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"rather ridiculous women professed themselves followers of Catharine, and"
1136,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,they produced plays of their own not without some success. With her they
1137,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"formed the trio of Female Wits who were mocked in the lively but, on the"
1138,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"whole, rather disappointing play I have just mentioned, in the course of"
1139,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,which it is spitefully remarked of Calista--who is Miss Trotter--that
1140,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"she has ""made no small struggle in the world to get into print,"" and is"
1141,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""now in such a state of wedlock to pen and ink that it will be very"
1142,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"difficult"" for her ""to get out of it."""
1143,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1144,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"In acting _The Female Wits_ Mrs. Temple, who had played the Princess in"
1145,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"_Agnes de Castro_, took the part of Calista, and doubtless, in the"
1146,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"coarse fashion of those days, made up exactly like poor Catharine"
1147,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Trotter, who was described as ""a Lady who pretends to the learned"
1148,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Languages, and assumes to herself the name of a Critic."" This was a"
1149,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"character, however, which she would not have protested against with much"
1150,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"vigour, for she had now quite definitely taken up the position of a"
1151,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,reformer and a pioneer. She posed as the champion of women's
1152,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"intellectual rights, and she was accepted as representing in active"
1153,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,literary work the movement which Mary Astell had recently foreshadowed
1154,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,in her remarkable _Serious Proposal to Ladies_ of 1694. We turn again to
1155,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"_The Female Wits_, and we find Marsilia (Mrs. Manley) describing Calista"
1156,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"to Mrs. Wellfed (Mrs. Fix) as ""the vainest, proudest, senseless Thing!"
1157,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,She pretends to grammar! writes in mood and figure! does everything
1158,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"methodically!"" Yet when Calista appears on the stage, Mrs. Manley rushes"
1159,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"across to fling her arms around her and to murmur: ""O charmingest Nymph"
1160,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of all Apollo's Train, let me embrace thee!"" Later on Calista says to"
1161,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Mrs. Pix, the fat tailoress, ""I cannot but remind you, Madam ... I read"
1162,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Aristotle in his own language""; and of a certain tirade in a play of Ben"
1163,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Jonson she insists: ""I know it so well, as to have turn'd it into"
1164,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Latin."" Mrs. Pix admits her own ignorance of all these things; she ""can"
1165,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"go no further than the eight parts of speech."" This brings down upon her"
1166,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"an icy reproof from Calista: ""Then I cannot but take the Freedom to say"
1167,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"... you impose upon the Town."" We get the impression of a preciseness of"
1168,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,manner and purpose which must have given Catharine a certain air of
1169,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"priggishness, not entirely unbecoming, perhaps, but very strange in that"
1170,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,loose theatre of William III.
1171,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1172,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Accordingly, in her next appearance, we find her complaining to the"
1173,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Princess (afterwards Queen Anne) that she has become ""the mark of ill"
1174,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Nature"" through recommending herself ""by what the other Sex think their"
1175,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"peculiar Prerogative""--that is, intellectual distinction. Catharine"
1176,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Trotter was still only nineteen years of age when she produced her
1177,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"tragedy of _Fatal Friendship_, the published copy of which (1698) is all"
1178,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,begarlanded with evidences of her high moral purpose in the shape of a
1179,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"succession of ""applausive copies"" of verses. In these we are told that"
1180,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"she had ""checked the rage of reigning vice that had debauched the"
1181,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"stage."" This was an allusion to the great controversy then just raised"
1182,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,by Jeremy Collier in his famous _Short View of the Immorality and
1183,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Profaneness of the Stage_, in which all the dramatists of the day were"
1184,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,violently attacked for their indecency. Catharine Trotter has the
1185,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"courage to side with Collier, and the tact to do so without quarrelling"
1186,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,with her male colleagues. She takes the side of the decent women.
1187,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1188,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""You as your Sex's champion art come forth"

1197,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1198,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,This was the most brilliant moment in the public career of our
1199,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,bluestocking. _Fatal Friendship_ enjoyed a success which Catharine
1200,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Trotter was not to taste again, and of all her plays it is the only one"
1201,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,which has ever been reprinted. It is very long and extremely
1202,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"sentimental, and written in rather prosy blank verse. Contemporaries"
1203,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"said that it placed Miss Trotter in the forefront of British drama, in"
1204,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"company with Congreve and Granville ""the polite,"" who had written a"
1205,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"_She-Gallants_, which was everything that Miss Trotter did not wish her"
1206,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"plays to be. _Fatal Friendship_ has an ingenious plot, in which the"
1207,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,question of money takes a prominence very unusual in tragedy. Almost
1208,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"every character in the piece is in reduced circumstances. Felicia,"
1209,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"sister to Belgard (who is too poor to maintain her), is wooed by the"
1210,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"wealthy Roquelaure, although she is secretly married to Gramont, who is"
1211,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"also too poor to support a wife. Belgard, afraid that Gramont will make"
1212,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"love to Felicia (that is, to his own secret wife), persuades him--in"
1213,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"order that his best friend, Castalio, may be released from a debtor's"
1214,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"prison--bigamously to many Lamira, a wealthy widow. But Castalio is in"
1215,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"love with Lamira, and is driven to frenzy by Gramont's illegal marriage."
1216,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,It all depends upon income in a manner comically untragical. The quarrel
1217,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,between the friends in the fifth act is an effective piece of
1218,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"stage-craft, but the action is spoiled by a ridiculous general butchery"
1219,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"at the close of all. However, the audience was charmed, and even ""the"
1220,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"stubbornest could scarce deny their Tears."""
1221,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1222,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"_Fatal Friendship_ was played at the Lincoln's Inn Theatre, and no doubt"
1223,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,it was Congreve who brought Miss Trotter over from Drury Lane. His warm
1224,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,friendship for her had unquestionably a great deal to do with her
1225,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,success and with the jealousy of her rivals. A letter exists in which
1226,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"the great dramatist acknowledges, in 1697, the congratulations of his"
1227,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"young admirer, and it breathes an eager cordiality. Congreve requested"
1228,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Betterton to present him to Catharine Trotter, and his partiality for"
1229,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,her company is mentioned by several writers. The spiteful author of _The
1230,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Female Wits_ insinuates that Congreve made the looking-over of
1231,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Catharine's scenes ""his pretence for daily visits."" Another satirist, in"
1232,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"1698, describes Congreve sitting very gravely with his hat over his"
1233,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"eyes, ""together with the two she-things called Poetesses which write for"
1234,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"his house,"" half-hidden from the public in a little side-box. Farquhar,"
1235,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"too, seeing the celebrated writer of _Fatal Friendship_ in the theatre"
1236,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"on the third night of the performance of his _Love and a Bottle_, had"
1237,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""his passions wrought so high"" by a sight of the beautiful author that"
1238,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"he wrote her a letter in which he called her ""one of the fairest of the"
1239,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"sex, and the best judge."" If Catharine Trotter, as the cynosure of"
1240,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"delicacy, at the age of nineteen, sat through _Love and a Bottle_"
1241,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"without a blush, even _her_ standard of decency was not very exacting."
1242,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"But in all this rough, coarse world of wit her reputation never suffered"
1243,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,a rebuff.
1244,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1245,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Encouraged by so much public and private attention, our young dramatist"
1246,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,continued to work with energy and conscientiousness. But her efforts
1247,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"were forestalled by an event, or rather a condition of the national"
1248,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"temper, of which too little notice has been taken by literary"
1249,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,historians. The attacks on the stage for its indecency and blasphemy had
1250,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"been flippantly met by the theatrical agents, but they had sunk deeply"
1251,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,into the conscience of the people. There followed with alarming
1252,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"abruptness a general public repulsion against the playhouses, and to"
1253,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"this, early in 1699, a roughly worded Royal Proclamation gave voice."
1254,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"During the whole of that year the stage was almost in abeyance, and even"
1255,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Congreve, with _The Way of the World_, was unable to woo his audience"
1256,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,back to Lincoln's Inn. During this time of depression Catharine Trotter
1257,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"composed at least two tragedies, which she was unable to get performed,"
1258,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,while the retirement of Congreve in a paroxysm of annoyance must have
1259,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,been a very serious disadvantage to her.
1260,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1261,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"On May 1st, 1700, Dryden died, and with him a dramatic age passed away."
1262,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,What Miss Trotter's exact relations with the great poet had been is
1263,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"uncertain; she not only celebrated his death in a long elegy, in which"
1264,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"she speaks on behalf of the Muses, but wrote another and more important"
1265,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"poem, in which she gives very sound advice to the poetical beginner, who"
1266,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"is to take Dryden as a model, and to be particularly careful to disdain"
1267,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Settle, Durfey, and Blackmore, typical poetasters of the period. She"
1268,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,recommends social satire to the playwright:--

1287,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1288,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,In this dead period of the stage Catharine Trotter found a warm friend
1289,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"and doubtless an efficient patron in a Lady Piers, of whom we should be"
1290,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"glad to know more. Sir George Piers, the husband of this lady, was an"
1291,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"officer of rank under the Duke of Marlborough, later to become useful to"
1292,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Catharine Trotter. Meanwhile the latter returned to the Theatre Royal in
1293,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Drury Lane, where, in 1701, under the patronage of Lord Halifax--Pope's"
1294,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""Bufo""--she produced her third tragedy, _The Unhappy Penitent_. The"
1295,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,dedication of this play to Halifax is a long and interesting essay on
1296,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"the poetry of the age. The author passes Dryden, Otway, Congreve, and"
1297,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Lee under examination, and finds technical blemishes in them all:--"

1302,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"present to him, studied her thoroughly, and boldly copied all her"
1303,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"various features, for though he has chiefly exerted himself on the"
1304,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"more masculine passions, 'tis as the choice of his judgment, not"
1305,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"the restraint of his genius, and he has given us as a proof he"
1306,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"could be every way equally admirable."""
1307,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1308,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Lady Piers wrote the prologue to _The Unhappy Penitent_ in verses better
1309,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,turned than might have been expected. She did not stint praise to her
1310,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"young friend, whom she compares to the rising sun:--"
1311,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1312,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""Like him, bright Maid, Thy great perfections shine"
1313,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"As awful, as resplendent, as divine!..."
1314,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Minerva and Diana guard your soul!"""
1315,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1316,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,_The Unhappy Penitent_ is not a pleasing performance: it is amorous and
1317,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"violent, but yet dull. Catharine's theory was better than her practice."
1318,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Nevertheless, it seems to have been successful, for the author some time"
1319,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"afterwards, speaking of the town's former discouragement of her dramas,"
1320,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"remarks that ""the taste is mended."" Later in 1701 she brought out at"
1321,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Drury Lane her only comedy, _Love at a Loss_, dedicated in most"
1322,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"enthusiastic terms to Lady Piers, to whom ""I owe the greatest Blessing"
1323,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of my Fate,"" the privilege of a share in her friendship. _Love at a"
1324,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Loss_ was made up of the comic scenes introduced into an old tragedy
1325,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,which the author had failed to get acted. This is not a fortunate method
1326,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of construction, and the town showed no favour to Love at a Loss. The"
1327,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,first and only public section of Catharine Trotter's career was now
1328,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"over, and she withdrew, a wayworn veteran at the age of twenty-two, to"
1329,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,more elevated studies.
1330,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1331,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"When _Love at a Loss_ was published the author had already left town,"
1332,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"and after a visit to Lady Piers in Kent she now settled at Salisbury, at"
1333,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"the house of a physician, Dr. Inglis, who had married her only sister."
1334,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Her growing intimacy with the family of Bishop Burnet may have had
1335,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,something to do with her determination to make this city her home. She
1336,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"formed a very enthusiastic friendship with the Bishop's second lady, who"
1337,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,was an active theologian and a very intelligent woman. Our poetess was
1338,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"fascinated by Mrs. Burnet. ""I have not met,"" she writes in 1701, ""such"
1339,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"perfection in any of our sex."" She now visited in the best Wiltshire"
1340,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"society. When the famous singer, John Abell, was in Salisbury, he gave a"
1341,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"concert at the palace, and Catharine Trotter was so enchanted that she"
1342,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,rode out after him six miles to Tisbury to hear him sing again at Lord
1343,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Arundell of Wardour's house. She had a great appreciation of the
1344,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Bishop's ""volatile activity."" It is now that the name of Locke first"
1345,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"occurs in her correspondence, and we gather that she came into some"
1346,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,personal contact with him through a member of the Bishop's
1347,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"family--George Burnet of Kemney, in Aberdeenshire--probably a cousin,"
1348,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,with whom she now cultivated an ardent intellectual friendship. He left
1349,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,England on a mission which occupied him from the middle of 1701 until
1350,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"1708, and this absence, as we may suspect, alone prevented their"
1351,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,acquaintance from ripening into a warmer feeling. The romance and
1352,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"tragedy of Catharine Trotter's life gather, it is plain, around this"
1353,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"George Burnet, who was a man of brilliant accomplishments and"
1354,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"interested, like herself, in philosophical studies."
1355,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1356,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"These, it would appear, Catharine Trotter had never abandoned, but she"
1357,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"applied herself to them closely at Salisbury, where she made some"
1358,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"superior acquaintances. One of these was John Norris of Bemerton, whose"
1359,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,_Theory of an Ideal and Intelligible World_ had just made some
1360,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,sensation. By the intermediary of George Burnet she came in touch with
1361,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"some of the leading French writers of the moment, such as Malebranche"
1362,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"and Madame Dacier. There is a French poet, unnamed, who understands"
1363,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"English, but he is gone to Rome before he can be made to read _The Fatal"
1364,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Friendship_. Meanwhile, Catharine Trotter's obsession with the ideas of"
1365,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Locke was giving some anxiety to her friends. That philosopher had
1366,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"published his famous _Essay on the Human Understanding_ in 1690, and it"
1367,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"had taken several years for the opposition to his views, and in"
1368,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"particular to his theological toleration, to take effect. But in 1697"
1369,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,there were made a number of almost simultaneous attacks on Locke's
1370,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"position. The circle at Salisbury was involved in them, for one of these"
1371,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"was written by Norris of Bemerton, and another is attributed to a member"
1372,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of the Burnet family. Catharine Trotter, who had studied Locke's later"
1373,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"works with enthusiastic approval, was scandalised by the attacks, and"
1374,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,sat down to refute them. This must have been in 1701.
1375,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1376,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Although the intellectual society of Salisbury was prominent in taking
1377,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"the conservative view of Locke, our bluestocking could not refrain from"
1378,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"telling Mrs. Burnet what she had done, nor from showing her treatise to"
1379,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"that friend under vows of confidence. But Mrs. Burnet, who was impulsive"
1380,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"and generous, could not keep the secret; she spoke about it to the"
1381,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Bishop, and then to Norris of Bemerton, and finally (in June 1702) to"
1382,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Locke himself. Locke was at Oates, confined by his asthma; he was old"
1383,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"and suffering, but still full of benevolence and curiosity, and he was"
1384,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,graciously interested in his remarkable defender at Salisbury. As he
1385,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"could not himself travel, he sent his adopted son to call on Catharine"
1386,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Trotter, with a present of books; this was Peter King, still a young"
1387,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"man, but already M.P. for Beer Alston, and later to become Lord"
1388,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Chancellor and the first Lord King of Ockham. George Burnet, writing"
1389,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"from Paris, had been very insistent that Catharine should not publish"
1390,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"her treatise, but she overruled his objections, and her _Defence of Mr."
1391,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Locke's Essay on the Human Understanding_ appeared anonymously in May
1392,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"1702. People were wonderfully polite in those days, and Locke himself"
1393,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"wrote to his ""protectress"" a charming letter in which he told her that"
1394,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"her ""_Defence_ was the greatest honour my Essay could have procured me."""
1395,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1396,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"She sent her _Defence_ to Leibnitz, who criticised it at considerable"
1397,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,length:--[3]
1398,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1399,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""J'ai lu livre de Mlle. Trotter. Dans la dedicace elle exhorte M."
1400,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Locke à donner des démonstrations de morale. Je crois qu'il aurait
1401,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,eu de la peine à y reussir. L'art de démontrer n'est pas son fait.
1402,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Je tiens que nous nous appercevons sans raisonnement de ce qui est
1403,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"juste et injuste, comme nous nous appercevons sans raison de"
1404,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,quelques theoremes de Geometrie; mais il est tousjours bon de venir
1405,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,à la démonstration. Justice et injustice ne dependent seulement de
1406,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"la nature humaine, mais de la nature de la substance intelligente"
1407,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,en général; et Mlle. Trotter remarque fort bien qu'elle vient de la
1408,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,nature de Dieu et n'est point arbitraire. La nature de Dieu est
1409,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"tousjours fondée en raison."""
1410,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1411,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Notwithstanding all this, the commentators of Locke appear, without"
1412,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"exception, to ignore the _Defence_, and it was probably never much read"
1413,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,outside the cultivated Salisbury circle.
1414,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1415,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"In this year, 1702, the health of Catharine Trotter began to give her"
1416,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"uneasiness, and it was for this reason that she left Salisbury for a"
1417,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"while. She was once more living in that city, however, from May 1703 to"
1418,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"March 1704, making a special study of geography. ""My strength,"" she"
1419,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"writes to George Burnet, ""is very much impaired, and God knows whether I"
1420,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"shall ever retrieve it."" Her thoughts turned again to the stage, and in"
1421,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"the early months of 1703 she composed her fifth and last play, the"
1422,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"tragedy of _The Revolution in Sweden_; ""but it will not be ready for"
1423,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"the stage,"" she says, ""till next winter."" Her interest in philosophy"
1424,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"did not flag. She was gratified by some communications, through Burnet,"
1425,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"with Leibnitz, and she would have liked to be the intermediary between"
1426,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Locke and some philosophical ""gentlemen"" on the Continent, probably"
1427,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Malebranche and Leibnitz, in a controversy. But this was hopeless, and"
1428,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"she writes (March 16th, 1704):--"
1429,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1430,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""Mr. Locke is unwilling to engage in controversy with the gentlemen"
1431,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"you mention; for, I am informed, his infirmities have obliged him,"
1432,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"for some time past, to desist from his serious studies, and only"
1433,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"employ himself in lighter things, which serve to amuse and unbend"
1434,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"the mind."""
1435,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1436,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Locke, indeed, had but six months more to live, and though he retained"
1437,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,his charming serenity of spirit he was well aware that the end
1438,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"approached. Never contentious or desirous of making a sensation, he was"
1439,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"least of all, in his present precarious state, likely to enter into"
1440,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,discussion with foreign philosophers. It does not appear that Catharine
1441,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Trotter ever enjoyed the felicity of seeing in the flesh the greatest
1442,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,object of her homage; but he occupied most of her thoughts. She was
1443,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,rendered highly indignant by the efforts made by the reactionaries at
1444,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Oxford and elsewhere to discourage the writings of Locke and to throw
1445,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,suspicion on their influence. She read over and over again his
1446,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"philosophical, educational, and religious treatises, and ever found them"
1447,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,more completely to her taste. If she had enjoyed the power to do so she
1448,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,would have proclaimed the wisdom and majesty of Locke from every
1449,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"housetop, and she envied Lady Masham her free and constant intercourse"
1450,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"with so beautiful a mind. Catharine Trotter watched, but from a"
1451,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"distance, the extinction of a life thus honoured, which came to a"
1452,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"peaceful end at Oates on October 28th, 1704. The following passage does"
1453,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,not appear--or I am much mistaken--to have attracted the attention of
1454,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Locke's biographers:--
1455,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1456,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""I was very sensibly touched with the news of Mr. Locke's death."
1457,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,All the particulars I hear of it are that he retained his perfect
1458,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"senses to the last, and spoke with the same composedness and"
1459,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,indifference on affairs as usual. His discourse was much on the
1460,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,different views a dying man has of worldly things; and that nothing
1461,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"gives him any satisfaction, but the reflection of what good he has"
1462,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,done in his life. Lady Masham went to his chamber to speak to him
1463,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"on some, business; when he had answered in the same manner he was"
1464,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"accustomed to speak, he desired her to leave the room, and,"
1465,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"immediately after she was gone, turned about and died."""
1466,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1467,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"She records that, after the death of Locke, Lady Masham communicated"
1468,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"with Leibnitz, and Catharine is very indignant because a doubt had been"
1469,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,suggested as to whether the writer's thoughts and expressions were her
1470,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"own. This was calculated to infuriate Catharine Trotter, who outpours in"
1471,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,forcible terms her just indignation:--
1472,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1473,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""Women are as capable of penetrating into the grounds of things,"
1474,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"and reasoning justly, as men are, who certainly have no advantage"
1475,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of us, but in their opportunities of knowledge. As Lady Masham is"
1476,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"allowed by everybody to have great natural endowments, she has"
1477,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,taken pains to improve them; and no doubt profited much by a long
1478,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,intimate society with so extraordinary a man as Mr. Locke. So that
1479,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,I see no reason to suspect a woman of her character would pretend
1480,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"to write anything that was not entirely her own. I pray, be more"
1481,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"equitable to her sex than the generality of your's are, who, when"
1482,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,anything is written by a woman that they cannot deny their
1483,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"approbation to, are sure to rob us of the glory of it by"
1484,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"concluding 'tis not her own."""
1485,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1486,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"This is the real voice of Catharine Trotter, raised to defend her sex,"
1487,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,and conscious of the many intellectual indignities and disabilities
1488,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,which they suffered.
1489,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1490,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"The first draft of _The Revolution in Sweden_ being now completed, she"
1491,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"sent it to Congreve, who was living very quietly in lodgings in Arundell"
1492,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Street. He allowed some time to go by before, on November 2nd, 1703, he"
1493,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"acknowledged it. His criticism, which is extremely kind, is also"
1494,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"penetrating and full. ""I think the design in general,"" he says, ""very"
1495,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"great and noble; the conduct of it very artful, if not too full of"
1496,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"business which may run into length and obscurity."" He warns her against"
1497,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"having too much noise of fighting on the stage in her second act, and"
1498,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"against offending probability in the third. The fourth act is confused,"
1499,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,and in the fifth there are too many harangues. Catharine Trotter has
1500,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"asked him to be frank, and so he is, but his criticism is practical and"
1501,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,encouraging. This excellent letter deserves to be better known.
1502,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1503,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"To continue the history of Miss Trotter's fifth and last play, _The"
1504,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Revolution in Sweden_ was at length brought out at the Queen's Theatre
1505,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"in the Haymarket, towards the close of 1704. It had every advantage"
1506,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"which popular acting could give it, since the part of the hero, Count"
1507,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Arwide, was played by Betterton; that of Constantia, the heroine, by"
1508,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Mrs. Barry; Gustavus by Booth; and Christina by Mrs. Harcourt. In spite
1509,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"of this galaxy of talent, the reception of the play was unfavourable."
1510,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"The Duchess of Marlborough ""and all her beauteous family"" graced the"
1511,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"theatre on the first night, but the public was cold and inattentive."
1512,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Some passages of a particularly lofty moral tone provoked laughter. _The
1513,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Revolution in Sweden_, in fact, was shown to suffer from the"
1514,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,ineradicable faults which Congreve had gently but justly suggested. It
1515,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"was very long, and very dull, and very wordy, and we could scarcely find"
1516,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,a more deadly specimen of virtuous and didactic tragedy. Catharine was
1517,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"dreadfully disappointed, nor was she completely consoled by being"
1518,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"styled--by no less a person than Sophia Charlotte, Queen of"
1519,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Prussia--""The Sappho of Scotland."" She determined, however, to appeal to"
1520,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"readers against auditors, and when, two years later, after still further"
1521,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"revision, she published _The Revolution in Sweden_, she dedicated it in"
1522,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"most grateful terms to the Duke of Marlborough's eldest daughter,"
1523,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Henrietta Godolphin.
1524,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1525,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,How Miss Trotter came to be favoured by the Churchills appears from
1526,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"various sources to be this. Her brother-in-law, Dr. Inglis, was now"
1527,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"physician-general in the army, and was in personal relations with the"
1528,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"General. When the victory at Blenheim (August 1704) was announced,"
1529,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Catharine Trotter wrote a poem of welcome back to England. It is to be
1530,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"supposed that a manuscript copy of it was shown by Inglis to the Duke,"
1531,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,with whose permission it was published about a month later. The poem
1532,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"enjoyed a tremendous success, for the Duke and Duchess and Lord"
1533,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Treasurer Godolphin ""and several others"" all liked the verses and said"
1534,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,they were better than any other which had been written on the subject.
1535,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"George Burnet, who saw the Duke in Germany, reported him highly pleased"
1536,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"with her--""the wisest virgin I ever knew,"" he writes. She now hoped,"
1537,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"with the Duke's protection, to recover her father's fortune and be no"
1538,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,longer a burden to her brother-in-law. A pension of £20 from Queen Anne
1539,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"gave her mother now a shadow of independence, but Catharine herself was"
1540,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"wholly disappointed at that ""settlement for my life"" which she was"
1541,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"ardently hoping for. I think that, if she had secured it, George Burnet"
1542,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,would have come back from Germany to marry her. Instead of that he sent
1543,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"her learned messages from Bayle and from Leibnitz, who calls her ""une"
1544,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Demoiselle fort spirituelle."""
1545,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1546,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Catharine Trotter now left London and Salisbury, and took up her abode"
1547,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"at Ockham Mills, close to Ripley, in Surrey, as companion to an invalid,"
1548,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Mrs. De Vere. She probably chose this place on account of the Locke
1549,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"connection and the friendship of Peter King, since there is now much in"
1550,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"her correspondence about Damaris, Lady Masham, and others in that circle"
1551,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,in which George Burnet himself was intimate. But great changes were
1552,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,imminent. Although her correspondence at this time is copious it is not
1553,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"always very intelligible, and it is very carelessly edited. Her constant"
1554,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,interchange of letters with George Burnet leaves the real position
1555,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"between them on many points obscure. In 1704, when he thought that he"
1556,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"was dying in Berlin, he wrote to Catharine Trotter that he had left her"
1557,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"£100 in his will, and added: ""Pray God I might live to give you much"
1558,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"more myself."" He regrets that he had so easily ""pulled himself from her"
1559,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"company,"" and suggests that if she had not left London to settle in"
1560,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,Salisbury he would have stayed in England. Years after they had parted
1561,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"we find him begging her to continue writing to him ""at least once a"
1562,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"week."" She, on her part, tells him that he well knows that there is but"
1563,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,one person she could ever think of marrying. He seems to have made her
1564,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"want of vivid religious conviction the excuse for not proposing to her,"
1565,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,but it is not easy to put aside the conviction that it was her want of a
1566,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"fortune which actuated him most strongly. Finally, he tries to pique her"
1567,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"by telling her that he ""knows of parties"" in the city of Hanover ""who"
1568,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"might bring him much honour and comfort"" were he ""not afraid of losing"
1569,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"(Catharine Trotter's) friendship."" They write to one another with"
1570,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"extreme formality, but that proves nothing. A young woman, passionately"
1571,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"in love with a man whom she had just accepted as her future husband,"
1572,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"was expected, in 1705, to close her letter by describing herself as"
1573,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""Sir, your very humble servant."""
1574,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1575,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"If George Burnet hinted of ""parties"" in Hanover, Catharine Trotter on"
1576,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"her side could boast of Mr. Fenn, ""a young clergyman of excellent"
1577,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"character,"" who now laid an ardent siege to her heart. Embarrassed by"
1578,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"these attentions, she took the bold step of placing the matter before"
1579,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Mr. Cockburn, a still younger clergyman, of even more excellent"
1580,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,character. The letter in which she makes this ingenuous declaration as
1581,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,to a father confessor is one of the tenderest examples extant of the
1582,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"""Why don't you speak for yourself, John?"" form of correspondence. Mr."
1583,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Cockburn, one of the minor clergy of the Salisbury set, did speak for"
1584,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"himself, and George Burnet having at length announced his own projected"
1585,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"marriage with a lady of old acquaintance, Catharine Trotter hesitated no"
1586,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,longer but accepted the hand of Mr. Cockburn. They were married early in
1587,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,1708. Thackeray could have created an amusing romance out of the
1588,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"relations of these four people to one another, and in particular it"
1589,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,would have been very interesting to see what he would have made of the
1590,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,character of George Burnet.
1591,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,
1592,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"Catharine Cockburn was now, after so eventful a life of emotional and"
1593,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"intellectual experience, still a young woman, not far past her"
1594,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,twenty-eighth birthday. She was to survive for more than forty-three
1595,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"years, during which time she was to correspond much, to write"
1596,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"persistently, and to publish whenever opportunity offered. But I do not"
1597,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,propose to accompany her much further on her blameless career. All
1598,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"through her married life, which was spent at various places far from"
1599,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"London, she existed almost like a plant in a Leyden jar. Constant"
1600,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"genteel poverty, making it difficult for her to buy books and impossible"
1601,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"to travel was supported by her with dignity and patience, but it dwarfed"
1602,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"her powers. Her later writings, on philosophy, on morality, on the"
1603,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"principles of the Christian religion, are so dull that merely to think"
1604,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,of them brings tears into one's eyes. She who had sparkled as a girl
1605,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,with Congreve and exchanged polite amenities with Locke lived on to see
1606,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,modern criticism begin with Samuel Johnson and the modern novel start
1607,THE PRECURSOR OF THE BLUESTOCKINGS,"with Samuel Richardson, but without observing that any change had come"

1658,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1659,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1660,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],The origins of the Romantic Movement in literature have been examined so
1661,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],closely and so often that it might be supposed that the subject must be
1662,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],by this time exhausted. But no subject of any importance in literature
1663,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"is ever exhausted, because the products of literature grow or decay,"
1664,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"burgeon or wither, as the generations of men apply their ever-varying"
1665,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"organs of perception to them. I intend, with your permission, to present"
1666,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],to you a familiar phase of the literary life of the eighteenth century
1667,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"from a fresh point of view, and in relation to two men whose surname"
1668,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],warrants a peculiar emphasis of respect in the mouth of a Warton
1669,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Lecturer. It is well, perhaps, to indicate exactly what it is which a"
1670,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],lecturer proposes to himself to achieve during the brief hour in which
1671,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],you indulge him with your attention; it certainly makes his task the
1672,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"easier if he does so. I propose, therefore, to endeavour to divine for"
1673,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"you, by scanty signs and indications, what it was in poetry, as it"
1674,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"existed up to the period of their childhood, which was stimulating to"
1675,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the Wartons, and what they disapproved of in the verse which was"
1676,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],fashionable and popular among the best readers in their day.
1677,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1678,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"There is an advantage, which I think that our critics are apt to"
1679,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"neglect, in analysing the character and causes of poetic pleasure"
1680,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"experienced by any sincere and enthusiastic reader, at any epoch of"
1681,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],history. We are far too much in the habit of supposing that what
1682,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],we--that is the most instructed and sensitive of us--admire now must
1683,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],always have been admired by people of a like condition. This has been
1684,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"one of the fallacies of Romantic criticism, and has led people as"
1685,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],illustrious as Keats into blaming the taste of foregoing generations as
1686,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"if it were not only heretical, but despicable as well. Young men to-day"
1687,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],speak of those who fifty years ago expatiated in admiration of Tennyson
1688,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"as though they were not merely stupid, but vulgar and almost wicked,"
1689,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],neglectful of the fact that it was by persons exactly analogous to
1690,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],themselves that those portions of Tennyson were adored which the young
1691,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],repudiate to-day. Not to expand too largely this question of the
1692,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"oscillation of taste--which, however, demands more careful examination"
1693,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],than it has hitherto received--it is always important to discover what
1694,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],was honestly admired at a given date by the most enthusiastic and
1695,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"intelligent, in other words by the most poetic, students of poetry. But"
1696,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],to do this we must cultivate a little of that catholicity of heart which
1697,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],perceives technical merit wherever it has been recognised at an earlier
1698,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"date, and not merely where the current generation finds it."
1699,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1700,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Joseph and Thomas Warton were the sons of an Oxford professor of poetry,"
1701,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],an old Jacobite of no observable merit beyond that of surrounding his
1702,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],family with an atmosphere of the study of verse. The elder brother was
1703,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"born in 1722, the younger in 1728. I must be forgiven if I dwell a"
1704,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"little tediously on dates, for our inquiry depends upon the use of them."
1705,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Without dates the whole point of that precedency of the Wartons, which I"
1706,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"desire to bring out, is lost. The brothers began very early to devote"
1707,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"themselves to the study of poetry, and in spite of the six years which"
1708,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"divided them, they appear to have meditated in unison. Their writings"
1709,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"bear a close resemblance to one another, and their merits and their"
1710,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],failures are alike identical. We have to form what broken impression we
1711,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],can of their early habits. Joseph is presented to us as wandering in the
1712,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"woodlands, lost in a melancholy fit, or waking out of it to note with"
1713,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"ecstasy all the effects of light and colour around him, the flight of"
1714,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"birds, the flutter of foliage, the panorama of cloudland. He and Thomas"
1715,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"were alike in their ""extreme thirst after ancient things."" They avoided,"
1716,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"with a certain disdain, the affectation of vague and conventional"
1717,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],reference to definite objects.
1718,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1719,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Above all they read the poets who were out of fashion, and no doubt the"
1720,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"library of their father, the Professor of Poetry, was at their disposal"
1721,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],from a very early hour. The result of their studies was a remarkable
1722,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"one, and the discovery was unquestionably first made by Joseph. He was,"
1723,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"so far as we can gather, the earliest person in the modern world of"
1724,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Europe to observe what vain sacrifices had been made by the classicists,"
1725,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"and in particular by the English classicists, and as he walked"
1726,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],enthusiastically in the forest he formed a determination to reconquer
1727,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],the realm of lost beauty. The moment that this instinct became a
1728,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"purpose, we may say that the great Romantic Movement, such as it has"
1729,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"enlarged and dwindled down to our own day, took its start. The Wartons"
1730,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"were not men of creative genius, and their works, whether in prose or"
1731,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"verse, have not taken hold of the national memory. But the advance of a"
1732,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],great army is not announced by a charge of field-marshals. In the
1733,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"present war, the advance of the enemy upon open cities has generally"
1734,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"been announced by two or three patrols on bicycles, who are the heralds"
1735,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],of the body. Joseph and Thomas Warton were the bicyclist-scouts who
1736,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],prophesied of an advance which was nearly fifty years delayed.
1737,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1738,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],The general history of English literature in the eighteenth century
1739,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],offers us little opportunity for realising what the environment could be
1740,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"of two such lads as the Wartons, with their enthusiasm, their"
1741,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"independence, and their revolutionary instinct. But I will take the year"
1742,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"1750, which is the year of Rousseau's first _Discours_ and therefore the"
1743,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],definite starting-point of European Romanticism. You will perhaps find
1744,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],it convenient to compare the situation of the Wartons with what is the
1745,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],situation to-day of some very modern or revolutionary young poet. In
1746,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"1750, then, Joseph was twenty-eight years of age and Thomas twenty-two."
1747,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Pope had died six years before, and this was equivalent to the death of"
1748,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Swinburne in the experience of our young man of to-day. Addison's death
1749,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"was as distant as is from us that of Matthew Arnold; and Thomson, who"
1750,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"had been dead two years, had left The _Castle of Indolence_ as an"
1751,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],equivalent to Mr. Hardy's _Dynasts_. All the leading writers of the age
1752,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"of Anne--except Young, who hardly belonged to it--were dead, but the"
1753,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Wartons were divided from them only as we are from those of the age of
1754,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Victoria. I have said that Pope was not more distant from them than
1755,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Swinburne is from us, but really a more just parallel is with Tennyson."
1756,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"The Wartons, wandering in their woodlands, were confronted with a"
1757,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"problem such as would be involved, to a couple of youths to-day, in"
1758,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],considering the reputation of Tennyson and Browning.
1759,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1760,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"There remains no doubt in my mind, after a close examination of such"
1761,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"documents as remain to us, that Joseph Warton, whose attitude has"
1762,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"hitherto been strangely neglected, was in fact the active force in this"
1763,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],remarkable revolt against existing conventions in the world of
1764,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],imaginative art. His six years of priority would naturally give him an
1765,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],advantage over his now better-known and more celebrated brother.
1766,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Moreover, we have positive evidence of the firmness of his opinions at a"
1767,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],time when his brother Thomas was still a child. The preface to Joseph's
1768,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"_Odes_ of 1746 remains as a dated document, a manifesto, which admits of"
1769,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"no question. But the most remarkable of his poems, ""The Enthusiast,"" was"
1770,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"stated to have been written in 1740, when he was eighteen and his"
1771,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"brother only twelve years of age. It is, of course, possible that these"
1772,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"verses, which bear no sign of juvenile mentality, were touched up at a"
1773,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"later date. But this could only be a matter of diction, of revision, and"
1774,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"we are bound to accept the definite and repeated statement of Joseph,"
1775,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],that they were essentially composed in 1740. If we accept this as a
1776,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"fact, ""The Enthusiast"" is seen to be a document of extraordinary"
1777,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"importance. I do not speak of the positive merit of the poem, which it"
1778,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"would be easy to exaggerate. Gray, in a phrase which has been much"
1779,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"discussed, dismissed the poetry of Joseph Warton by saying that he had"
1780,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""no choice at all."" It is evident to me that Gray meant by this to"
1781,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"stigmatise the diction of Joseph Warton, which is jejune, verbose, and"
1782,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],poor. He had little magic in writing; he fails to express himself with
1783,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"creative charm. But this is not what constitutes his interest for us,"
1784,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],which is moreover obscured by the tameness of his Miltonic-Thomsonian
1785,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"versification. What should arrest our attention is the fact that here,"
1786,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"for the first time, we find unwaveringly emphasised and repeated what"
1787,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"was entirely new in literature, the essence of romantic hysteria. ""The"
1788,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Enthusiast"" is the earliest expression of full revolt against the"
1789,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],classical attitude which had been sovereign in all European literature
1790,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],for nearly a century. So completely is this expressed by Joseph Warton
1791,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],that it is extremely difficult to realise that he could not have come
1792,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"under the fascination of Rousseau, whose apprenticeship to love and"
1793,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"idleness was now drawing to a close at Les Charmettes, and who was not"
1794,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],to write anything characteristic until ten years later.
1795,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1796,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],But these sentiments were in the air. Some of them had vaguely occurred
1797,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"to Young, to Dyer, and to Shenstone, all of whom received from Joseph"
1798,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Warton the ardent sympathy which a young man renders to his immediate
1799,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],contemporaries. The Scotch resumption of ballad-poetry held the same
1800,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],relation to the Wartons as the so-called Celtic Revival would to a young
1801,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"poet to-day; the _Tea-Table Miscellany_ dates from 1724, and Allan"
1802,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Ramsay was to the author of ""The Enthusiast"" what Mr. Yeats is to us."
1803,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"But all these were glimmerings or flashes; they followed no system, they"
1804,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],were accompanied by no principles of selection or rejection. These we
1805,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],find for the first time in Joseph Warton. He not merely repudiates the
1806,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"old formulas and aspirations, but he defines new ones. What is very"
1807,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],interesting to observe in his attitude to the accepted laws of poetical
1808,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],practice is his solicitude for the sensations of the individual. These
1809,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],had been reduced to silence by the neo-classic school in its
1810,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],determination to insist on broad Palladian effects of light and line.
1811,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],The didactic and moral aim of the poets had broken the springs of
1812,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"lyrical expression, and had replaced those bursts of enthusiasm, those"
1813,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"indiscretions, those rudenesses which are characteristic of a romantic"
1814,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"spirit in literature, by eloquence, by caution, by reticence and"
1815,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],vagueness.
1816,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1817,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],It is not necessary to indicate more than very briefly what the
1818,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],principles of the classic poetry had been. The time had passed when
1819,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],readers and writers in England gave much attention to the sources of the
1820,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"popular poetry of their day. Malherbe had never been known here, and the"
1821,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"vigorous _Art poétique_ of Boileau, which had been eagerly studied at"
1822,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the close of the seventeenth century, was forgotten. Even the Prefaces"
1823,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"of Dryden had ceased to be read, and the sources of authority were now"
1824,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],the prose of Addison and the verse of Pope. To very young readers these
1825,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],stood in the same relation as the writings of the post-Tennysonian
1826,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"critics stand now. To reject them, to question their authority, was"
1827,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],like eschewing the essays of Matthew Arnold and Walter Pater. In
1828,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"particular, the _Essay on Criticism_ was still immensely admired and"
1829,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],read; it had crystallised around cultivated opinion very much as the
1830,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],_Studies in the Renaissance_ did from 1875 onwards. It was the last
1831,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"brilliant word on the aims and experiences of poetical art, and how"
1832,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],brilliant it was can be judged by the pleasure with which we read it
1833,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"to-day, in spite of our total repudiation of every æsthetic dogma which"
1834,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"it conveys. It is immortal, like every supreme literary expression, and"
1835,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],it stands before us in the history of poetry as an enduring landmark.
1836,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],This was the apparently impregnable fortress which the Wartons had the
1837,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],temerity to bombard.
1838,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1839,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Pope had said that Nature was the best guide to judgment, but what did"
1840,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"he mean by nature? He had meant the ""rules,"" which he declared were"
1841,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""Nature methodis'd"" or, as we should say, systematised. The ""rules"" were"
1842,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the maxims, rather than laws, expressed by Aristotle in a famous"
1843,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"treatise. The poet was to follow the Stagirite, ""led""--as Pope says in"
1844,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"one of those rare lines in which he catches, in spite of himself, the"
1845,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Romantic accent--""led by the light of the Mæonian Star."" Aristotle"
1846,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],illustrated by Homer--that was to be the standard of all poetic
1847,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"expression. But literature had wandered far from Homer, and we have to"
1848,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],think of what rules the _Essay on Criticism_ laid down. The poet was to
1849,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"be cautious, ""to avoid extremes"": he must be conventional, never"
1850,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""singular""; there was constant reference to ""Wit,"" ""Nature,"" and ""The"
1851,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Muse,"" and these were convertible terms. A single instance is luminous."
1852,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],We have the positive authority of Warburton for saying that Pope
1853,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],regarded as the finest effort of his skill and art as a poet the
1854,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],insertion of the machinery of the Sylphs into the revised edition of
1855,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"_The Rape of the Lock_ (1714). Now this insertion was ingenious,"
1856,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"brilliant, and in strict accordance with the practice of Vida and of"
1857,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Boileau, both of whom it excelled. But the whole conception of it was as"
1858,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],unlike that of Romanticism as possible.
1859,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1860,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"In particular, the tendency of the classic school, in its later"
1861,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"development, had been towards the exclusion of all but didactic and"
1862,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],ethical considerations from treatment in verse. Pope had given great and
1863,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"ever-increasing emphasis to the importance of making ""morals"" prominent"
1864,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"in poetry. All that he wrote after he retired to Twickenham, still a"
1865,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"young man, in 1718, was essentially an attempt to gather together ""moral"
1866,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"wisdom"" clothed in consummate language. He inculcated a moderation of"
1867,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"feeling, a broad and general study of mankind, an acceptance of the"
1868,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"benefits of civilisation, and a suppression of individuality. Even in so"
1869,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],violent and so personal a work as the _Dunciad_ he expends all the
1870,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],resources of his genius to make his anger seem moral and his indignation
1871,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],a public duty. This conception of the ethical responsibility of verse
1872,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"was universal, and even so late as 1745, long after the composition of"
1873,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Warton's ""Enthusiast,"" we find Blacklock declaring, with general"
1874,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"acceptance, that ""poetical genius depends entirely on the quickness of"
1875,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"moral feeling,"" and that not to ""feel poetry"" was the result of having"
1876,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""the affections and internal senses depraved by vice."""
1877,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1878,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],The most important innovation suggested by Joseph Warton was an
1879,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],outspoken assertion that this was by no means the object or the proper
1880,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"theme of poetry. His verses and those of his brother, the _Essay on"
1881,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Pope_ of the elder, the critical and historical writings of the younger,"
1882,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],may be searched in vain for the slightest evidence of moral or didactic
1883,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],sentiment. The instructive and ethical mannerisms of the later
1884,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"classicists had produced some beautiful and more accomplished verse,"
1885,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"especially of a descriptive order, but its very essence had excluded"
1886,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"self-revelation. Dennis, at whom Pope taught the world to laugh, but"
1887,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],who was in several respects a better critic than either Addison or
1888,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"himself, had come close to the truth sometimes, but was for ever edged"
1889,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],away from it by the intrusion of the moral consideration. Dennis feels
1890,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"things æsthetically, but he blunders into ethical definition. The result"
1891,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],was that the range of poetry was narrowed to the sphere of didactic
1892,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"reflection, a blunt description of scenery or objects being the only"
1893,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"relief, since"
1894,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1895,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""who could take offence"
1896,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"While pure description held the place of sense?"""
1897,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1898,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],To have perceived the bankruptcy of the didactic poem is Joseph Warton's
1899,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"most remarkable innovation. The lawlessness of the Romantic Movement, or"
1900,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"rather its instinct for insisting that genius is a law unto itself, is"
1901,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"first foreshadowed in ""The Enthusiast,"" and when the history of the"
1902,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],school comes to be written there will be a piquancy in tracing an
1903,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"antinomianism down from the blameless Wartons to the hedonist essays of,"
1904,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Oscar Wilde and the frenzied anarchism of the Futurists. Not less
1905,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"remarkable, or less characteristic, was the revolt against the quietism"
1906,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"of the classical school. ""Avoid extremes,"" Pope had said, and"
1907,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"moderation, calmness, discretion, absence of excitement had been laid"
1908,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"down as capital injunctions. Joseph Warton's very title, ""The"
1909,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Enthusiast,"" was a challenge, for ""enthusiasm"" was a term of reproach."
1910,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"He was himself a scandal to classical reserve. Mant, in the course of"
1911,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"some excellent lines addressed to Joseph Warton, remarks"
1912,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1913,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""Thou didst seek"
1914,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Ecstatic vision by the haunted stream
1915,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Or grove of fairy: then thy nightly ear,"
1916,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"As from the wild notes of some airy harp,"
1917,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Thrilled with strange music."""
1918,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1919,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],The same excess of sensibility is still more clearly divulged in
1920,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Joseph's own earliest verses:--
1921,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1922,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""All beauteous Nature! by thy boundless charms"
1923,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Oppress'd, O where shall I begin thy praise,"
1924,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Where turn the ecstatic eye, _how ease my breast"
1925,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"That pants with wild astonishment and love_?"""
1926,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1927,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"The Nature here addressed is a very different thing from the ""Nature"
1928,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"methodis'd"" of the _Essay on Criticism_. It is not to be distinguished"
1929,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],from the object of pantheistic worship long afterwards to be celebrated
1930,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"in widely differing language, but with identical devotion, by Wordsworth"
1931,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"and Senancour, by Chateaubriand and Shelley."
1932,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1933,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Closely connected with this attitude towards physical nature is the
1934,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"determination to deepen the human interest in poetry, to concentrate"
1935,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],individuality in passion. At the moment when the Wartons put forth their
1936,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"ideas, a change was taking place in English poetry, but not in the"
1937,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],direction of earnest emotion. The instrument of verse had reached an
1938,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"extraordinary smoothness, and no instance of its capability could be"
1939,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"more interesting than the poetry of Shenstone, with his perfect"
1940,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],utterance of things essentially not worth saying. In the most important
1941,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"writers of that very exhausted moment, technical skill seems the only"
1942,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"quality calling for remark, and when we have said all that sympathy can"
1943,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"say for Whitehead and Akenside, the truth remains that the one is vapid,"
1944,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],the other empty. The Wartons saw that more liberty of imagination was
1945,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"wanted, and that the Muse was not born to skim the meadows, in short low"
1946,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"flights, like a wagtail. They used expressions which reveal their"
1947,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"ambition. The poet was to be ""bold, without confine,"" and ""imagination's"
1948,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"chartered libertine""; like a sort of Alastor, he was"
1949,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1950,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""in venturous bark to ride"
1951,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Down turbulent Delight's tempestuous tide."""
1952,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1953,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"These are aspirations somewhat absurdly expressed, but the aim of them"
1954,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],is undeniable and noteworthy.
1955,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1956,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"A passion for solitude always precedes the romantic obsession, and in"
1957,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"examining the claim of the Wartons to be pioneers, we naturally look for"
1958,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],this element. We find it abundantly in their early verses. When Thomas
1959,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],was only seventeen--the precocity of the brothers was remarkable--he
1960,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"wrote a ""Pleasures of Melancholy,"" in which he expresses his wish to"
1961,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"retire to ""solemn glooms, congenial to the soul."" In the early odes of"
1962,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],his brother Joseph we find still more clearly indicated the intention to
1963,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"withdraw from the world, in order to indulge the susceptibilities of the"
1964,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],spirit in solitary reflection. A curious air of foreshadowing the
1965,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"theories of Rousseau, to which I have already referred, produces an"
1966,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"effect which is faintly indicated, but in its phantom way unique in"
1967,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"English literature up to that date, 1740. There had been a tendency to"
1968,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the sepulchral in the work of several writers, in particular in the"
1969,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"powerful and preposterous religious verse of Isaac Watts, but nothing"
1970,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],had been suggested in the pure Romantic style.
1971,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1972,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"In Joseph Warton, first, we meet with the individualist attitude to"
1973,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],nature; a slightly hysterical exaggeration of feeling which was to be
1974,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],characteristic of romance; an intention of escaping from the vanity of
1975,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],mankind by an adventure into the wilds; a purpose of recovering
1976,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],primitive manners by withdrawing into primitive conditions; a passion
1977,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],for what we now consider the drawing-master's theory of the
1978,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"picturesque--the thatched cottage, the ruined castle with the moon"
1979,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"behind it, the unfettered rivulet, the wilderness of"
1980,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1981,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""the pine-topped precipice"
1982,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Abrupt and shaggy."""
1983,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1984,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"There was already the fallacy, to become so irresistibly attractive to"
1985,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the next generation, that man in a state of civilisation was in a"
1986,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"decayed and fallen condition, and that to achieve happiness he must"
1987,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"wander back into a Golden Age. Pope, in verses which had profoundly"
1988,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"impressed two generations, had taken the opposite view, and had proved"
1989,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],to the satisfaction of theologian and free-thinker alike that
1990,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1991,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""God and Nature link'd the general frame,"
1992,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"And bade Self-love and Social be the same."""
1993,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1994,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Joseph Warton would have nothing to say to Social Love. He designed, or"
1995,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"pretended to design, to emigrate to the backwoods of America, to live"
1996,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
1997,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""With simple Indian swains, that I may hunt"
1998,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"The boar and tiger through savannahs wild,"
1999,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Through fragrant deserts and through citron groves,"""
2000,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2001,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"indulging, without the slightest admixture of any active moral principle"
2002,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"in social life, all the ecstasies, all the ravishing emotions, of an"
2003,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"abandonment to excessive sensibility. The soul was to be, no longer the"
2004,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""little bark attendant"" that ""pursues the triumph and partakes the gale"""
2005,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"in Pope's complacent _Fourth Epistle_, but an æolian harp hung in some"
2006,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],cave of a primeval forest for the winds to rave across in solitude.
2007,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2008,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""Happy the first of men, ere yet confin'd"
2009,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"To smoky cities."""
2010,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2011,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Already the voice is that of Obermann, of René, of Byron."
2012,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2013,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Another point in which the recommendations of the Wartons far outran the
2014,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],mediocrity of their execution was their theory of description. To
2015,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],comprehend the state of mind in which such pieces of stately verse as
2016,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Parnell's _Hermit_ or Addison's _Campaign_ could be regarded as
2017,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],satisfactory in the setting of their descriptive ornament we must
2018,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],realise the aim which those poets put before them. Nothing was to be
2019,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],mentioned by its technical--or even by its exact name; no clear picture
2020,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],was to be raised before the inner eye; nothing was to be left definite
2021,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],or vivid. We shall make a very great mistake if we suppose this
2022,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"conventional vagueness to have been accidental, and a still greater if"
2023,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],we attribute it to a lack of cleverness. When Pope referred to the
2024,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],sudden advent of a heavy shower at a funeral in these terms--
2025,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2026,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""'Tis done, and nature's various charms decay;"
2027,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],See gloomy clouds obscure the cheerful day!
2028,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Now hung with pearls the dropping trees appear,"
2029,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Their faded honours scatter'd on her bier,"""
2030,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2031,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],it was not because he had not the skill to come into closer touch with
2032,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"reality, but that he did not wish to do so. It had been plainly laid"
2033,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],down by Malherbe and confirmed by Boileau that objects should be named
2034,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"in general, not in precise terms. We are really, in studying the"
2035,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"descriptive parts of the Classicist poets, very close to the theories of"
2036,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Mallarmé and the Symbolists which occupied us twenty years ago. The
2037,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"object of the poet was not to present a vivid picture to the reader, but"
2038,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],to start in him a state of mind.
2039,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2040,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"We must recollect, in considering what may seem to us the sterility and"
2041,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"stiffness of the English poets from 1660 to 1740, that they were"
2042,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"addressing a public which, after the irregular violence and anarchical"
2043,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"fancy of the middle of the seventeenth century, had begun to yearn for"
2044,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"regularity, common sense, and a moderation in relative variety. The"
2045,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"simplest ideas should be chosen, and should depend for their poetical"
2046,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"effect, not upon a redundant and gorgeous ornament, but solely upon"
2047,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"elegance of language. There were certain references, certain channels of"
2048,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"imagery, which were purely symbolical, and these could be defended only"
2049,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"on the understanding that they produced on the mind of the reader,"
2050,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"instantly and without effort, the illustrative effect required. For"
2051,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"instance, with all these neo-classicists, the mythological allusions,"
2052,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"which seem vapid and ridiculous to us, were simplified metaphor and a"
2053,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"question of style. In short, it rested the jaded imagination of Europe,"
2054,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"after Gongora and Marini, Donne and D'Aubigné, to sink back on a poetry"
2055,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"which had taken a vow to remain scrupulous, elegant, and selected."
2056,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2057,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],But the imagination of England was now beginning to be impatient of
2058,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],these bonds. It was getting tired of a rest-cure so prolonged. It asked
2059,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"for more colour, more exuberance, more precise reproduction of visual"
2060,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],impressions. Thomson had summed up and had carried to greater lengths
2061,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the instinct for scenery which had never entirely died out in England,"
2062,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],except for a few years after the Restoration. It was left to Joseph
2063,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Warton, however, to rebel against the whole mode in which the cabbage of"
2064,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],landscape was shredded into the classical _pot-au-feu_. He proposes
2065,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"that, in place of the mention of ""Idalia's groves,"" when Windsor Forest"
2066,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"is intended, and of milk-white bulls sacrificed to Phoebus at"
2067,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Twickenham, the poets should boldly mention in their verses English"
2068,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""places remarkably romantic, the supposed habitation of druids, bards,"
2069,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"and wizards,"" and he vigorously recommends Theocritus as a model far"
2070,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],superior to Pope because of the greater exactitude of his references to
2071,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"objects, and because of his more realistic appeal to the imagination."
2072,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Description, Warton says, should be uncommon, exact, not symbolic and"
2073,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"allusive, but referring to objects clearly, by their real names. He very"
2074,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"pertinently points out that Pope, in a set piece of extraordinary"
2075,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"cleverness--which was to be read, more than half a century later, even"
2076,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"by Wordsworth, with pleasure--confines himself to rural beauty in"
2077,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"general, and declines to call up before us the peculiar beauties which"
2078,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],characterise the Forest of Windsor.
2079,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2080,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"A specimen of Joseph Warton's descriptive poetry may here be given, not"
2081,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"for its great inherent excellence, but because it shows his resistance"
2082,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],to the obstinate classic mannerism:--
2083,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2084,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""Tell me the path, sweet wanderer, tell,"
2085,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"To thy unknown sequestered cell,"
2086,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Where woodbines cluster round the door,"
2087,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Where shells and moss o'erlay the floor,"
2088,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"And on whose top an hawthorn blows,"
2089,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Amid whose thickly-woven boughs
2090,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Some nightingale still builds her nest,"
2091,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Each evening warbling thee to rest;

2093,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Rapt in some wild poetic dream,"
2094,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],In converse while methinks I rove

2096,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2097,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],To show how identical were the methods of the two brothers we may
2098,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"compare the foregoing lines with the following from Thomas Warton's ""Ode"
2099,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"on the Approach of Summer"" (published when he was twenty-five, and"
2100,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],possibly written much earlier):--
2101,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2102,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""His wattled cotes the shepherd plaits;"
2103,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Beneath her elm the milkmaid chats;
2104,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"The woodman, speeding home, awhile"
2105,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Rests him at a shady stile;
2106,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Nor wants there fragrance to dispense
2107,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Refreshment o'er my soothèd sense;
2108,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Nor tangled woodbine's balmy bloom,"
2109,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Nor grass besprent to breathe perfume,"
2110,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Nor lurking wild-thyme's spicy sweet
2111,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],To bathe in dew my roving feet;
2112,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Nor wants there note of Philomel,"
2113,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Nor sound of distant-tinkling bell,"
2114,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Nor lowings faint of herds remote,"
2115,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Nor mastiff's bark from bosom'd cot;

2119,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Full loud the chafer-swarms rejoice."""
2120,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2121,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],The youthful poet is in full revolt against the law which forbade his
2122,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"elders to mention objects by their plain names. Here we notice at once,"
2123,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"as we do in similar early effusions of both the Wartons, the direct"
2124,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],influence of Milton's lyrics. To examine the effect of the rediscovery
2125,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],of Milton upon the poets of the middle of the eighteenth century would
2126,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],lead us too far from the special subject of our inquiry to-day. But it
2127,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],must be pointed out that _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_ had been
2128,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"entirely neglected, and practically unknown, until a date long after the"
2129,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],rehabilitation of _Paradise Lost_. The date at which Handel set them to
2130,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"music, 1740, is that of the revived or discovered popularity of these"
2131,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"two odes, which then began to be fashionable, at all events among the"
2132,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"younger poets. They formed a bridge, which linked the new writers with"
2133,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the early seventeenth century across the Augustan Age, and their"
2134,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],versification as well as their method of description were as much
2135,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"resisted by the traditional Classicists as they were attractive, and"
2136,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"directly preferred above those of Pope, by the innovators. Joseph"
2137,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Warton, who attributed many of the faults of modern lyrical writing to"
2138,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the example of Petrarch, sets Milton vehemently over against him, and"
2139,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"entreats the poets ""to accustom themselves to contemplate fully every"
2140,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"object before they attempt to describe it."" They were above all to avoid"
2141,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"nauseous repetition of commonplaces, and what Warton excellently calls"
2142,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""hereditary images."""
2143,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2144,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"We must not, however, confine ourselves to a consideration of ""The"
2145,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Enthusiast"" of 1740 and the preface to the _Odes_ of 1746. Certain of"
2146,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the expressions, indeed, already quoted, are taken from the two very"
2147,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],important critical works which the brothers published while they were
2148,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],still quite young. We must now turn particularly to Joseph Warton's
2149,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"_Essay on the Genius of Pope_ of 1756, and to Thomas Warton's"
2150,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],_Observations on the Faerie Queene_ of 1754. Of these the former is the
2151,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],more important and the more readable. Joseph's _Essay on Pope_ is an
2152,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],extraordinary production for the time at which it was produced. Let me
2153,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],suggest that we make a great mistake in treating the works of old
2154,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],writers as if they had been always written by old men. I am trying to
2155,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"present the Wartons to you as I see them, and that is as enthusiastic"
2156,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"youths, flushed with a kind of intellectual felicity, and dreaming how"
2157,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"poetry shall be produced as musicians make airs, by inspiration, not by"
2158,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],rote. Remember that when they took their walks in the forest at
2159,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Hackwood, the whole world of culture held that true genius had expired"
2160,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"with Pope, and this view was oracularly supported by Warburton and"
2161,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],such-like pundits. I have already pointed out to you that Pope was
2162,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],divided from them not more than Swinburne is divided from us. Conceive
2163,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],two very young men to-day putting their heads together to devise a
2164,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"scheme of poetry which should entirely supersede that, not of Swinburne"
2165,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"only, but of Tennyson and Browning also, and you have the original"
2166,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],attitude of the Wartons.
2167,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2168,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],It is difficult for us to realise what was the nature of the spell which
2169,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Pope threw over the literary conscience of the eighteenth century. Forty
2170,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"years after the revolt of the Wartons, Pope was still looked upon by the"
2171,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"average critic as ""the most distinguished and the most interesting Poet"
2172,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"of the nation."" Joseph Warton was styled ""the Winton Pedant"" for"
2173,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"suggesting that Pope paid too dearly for his lucidity and lightness, and"
2174,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],for desiring to break up with odes and sonnets the oratorical mould
2175,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],which gave a monotony of form to early eighteenth-century verse. His
2176,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"_Essay on Pope_, though written with such studied moderation that we"
2177,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"may, in a hasty reading, regard it almost as a eulogy, was so shocking"
2178,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],to the prejudices of the hour that it was received with universal
2179,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"disfavour, and twenty-six years passed before the author had the moral"
2180,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"courage to pursue it to a conclusion. He dedicated it to Young, who,"
2181,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"alone of the Augustans, had admitted that charm in a melancholy"
2182,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"solitude, that beauty of funereal and mysterious effects, which was to"
2183,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"be one of the leading characteristics of the Romantic School, and who"
2184,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"dimly perceived the sublime and the pathetic to be ""the two chief nerves"
2185,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"of all genuine poetry."""
2186,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2187,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Warton's _Essay on the Genius of Pope_ is not well arranged, and, in"
2188,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"spite of eloquent passages, as literature it does not offer much"
2189,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],attraction to the reader of the present day. But its thesis is one which
2190,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"is very interesting to us, and was of startling novelty when it was"
2191,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"advanced. In the author's own words it was to prove that ""a clear head"
2192,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"and acute understanding are not sufficient, alone, to make a poet."" The"
2193,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"custom of critics had been to say that, when supported by a profound"
2194,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"moral sense, they were sufficient, and Pope was pointed to as the"
2195,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],overwhelming exemplar of the truth of this statement. Pope had taken
2196,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"this position himself and, as life advanced, the well of pure poetry in"
2197,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"him had dried up more and more completely, until it had turned into a"
2198,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"sort of fountain of bright, dry sand, of which the _Epilogue to the"
2199,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Satires_, written in 1738, when Joseph Warton was sixteen years of age,"
2200,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],may be taken as the extreme instance. The young author of the _Essay_
2201,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],made the earliest attempt which any one made to put Pope in his right
2202,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"place, that is to say, not to deny him genius or to deprecate the"
2203,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"extreme pleasure readers found in his writings, but to insist that, by"
2204,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the very nature of his gifts, his was genius of a lower rank than that"
2205,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"of the supreme poets, with whom he was commonly paralleled when he was"
2206,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],not preferred to them all.
2207,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2208,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Warton admitted but three supreme English poets--Spenser, Shakespeare,"
2209,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Milton--and he vehemently insisted that moral, didactic and panegyrical"
2210,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],poetry could never rise above the second class in importance. To assert
2211,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"this was not merely to offend against the undoubted supremacy of Pope,"
2212,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],but it was to flout the claims of all those others to whom the age gave
2213,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"allegiance. Joseph Warton does not shrink from doing this, and he gives"
2214,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"reason for abating the claims of all the classic favourites--Cowley,"
2215,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Waller, Dryden, Addison. When it was advanced against him that he showed"
2216,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],arrogance in placing his opinion against that of a multitude of highly
2217,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"trained judges, he replied that a real ""relish and enjoyment of poetry"""
2218,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"is a rare quality, and ""a creative and glowing imagination"" possessed by"
2219,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"few. When the _dicta_ of Boileau were quoted against him, he repudiated"
2220,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],their authority with scarcely less vivacity than Keats was to display
2221,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],half a century later.
2222,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2223,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Joseph Warton's _Essay_ wanders about, and we may acknowledge ourselves"
2224,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],more interested in the mental attitude which it displays than in the
2225,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"detail of its criticism. The author insists, with much force, on the"
2226,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],value of a grandiose melancholy and a romantic horror in creating a
2227,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"poetical impression, and he allows himself to deplore that Pope was so"
2228,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"ready to forget that ""wit and satire are transitory and perishable, but"
2229,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"nature and passion are eternal."" We need not then be surprised when"
2230,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Joseph Warton boldly protests that no other part of the writings of Pope
2231,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"approaches _Eloisa to Abelard_ in the quality of being ""truly poetical."""
2232,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],He was perhaps led to some indulgence by the fact that this is the one
2233,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"composition in which Pope appears to be indebted to Milton's lyrics, but"
2234,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"there was much more than that. So far as I am aware, _Eloisa to Abelard_"
2235,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"had never taken a high place with Pope's extreme admirers, doubtless"
2236,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],because of its obsession with horror and passion. But when we read how
2237,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2238,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves,"
2239,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Long-sounding aisles, and intermingled graves,"
2240,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Black melancholy sits, and round her throws"
2241,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"A death-like silence and a dead repose,"""
2242,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2243,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],and still more when we reflect on the perpetual and powerful appeals
2244,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"which the poem makes to emotion unbridled by moral scruple, we have no"
2245,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],difficulty in perceiving why _Eloisa to Abelard_ exercised so powerful
2246,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"an attraction on Joseph Warton. The absence of ethical reservation, the"
2247,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"licence, in short, was highly attractive to him, and he rejoiced in"
2248,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"finding Pope, even so slightly, even so briefly, faithless to his"
2249,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],formula. It is worth while to note that Joseph Warton's sympathy with
2250,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],the sentimental malady of the soul which lies at the core of Romanticism
2251,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"permitted him to be, perhaps, the first man since the Renaissance who"
2252,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],recognised with pleasure the tumult of the _Atys_ of Catullus and the
2253,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],febrile sensibility of Sappho.
2254,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2255,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Both brothers urged that more liberty of imagination was what English
2256,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],poetry needed; that the lark had been shut up long enough in a gilded
2257,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],cage. We have a glimpse of Thomas Warton introducing the study of the
2258,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"great Italian classics into Oxford at a very early age, and we see him"
2259,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],crowned with laurel in the common-room of Trinity College at the age of
2260,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],nineteen. This was in the year before the death of Thomson. No doubt he
2261,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"was already preparing his _Observations on the Faerie Queene_, which"
2262,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],came out a little later. He was Professor of Poetry at Oxford before he
2263,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],was thirty. Both the brothers took great pleasure in the study of
2264,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Spenser, and they both desired that the supernatural ""machinery"" of"
2265,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Ariosto, in common with the romance of _The Faerie Queene_, should be"
2266,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],combined with a description of nature as untrimmed and unshackled as
2267,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"possible. Thomas Warton, in his remarkable Oxford poem, ""The Painted"
2268,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Window,"" describes himself as"
2269,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2270,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""A faithless truant to the classic page,"
2271,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],Long have I loved to catch the simple chime
2272,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Of minstrel-harps, and spell the fabling rhyme,"""
2273,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2274,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],and again he says:--
2275,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2276,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""I soothed my sorrows with the dulcet lore"
2277,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Which Fancy fabled in her elfin age,"""
2278,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2279,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"that is to say when Spenser was writing ""upon Mulla's shore."""
2280,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2281,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"After all this, the Observations on the Faerie Queene of 1754 is rather"
2282,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],disappointing. Thomas was probably much more learned as a historian of
2283,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"literature than Joseph, but he is not so interesting a critic. Still, he"
2284,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"followed exactly the same lines, with the addition of a wider knowledge."
2285,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"His reading is seen to be already immense, but he is tempted to make too"
2286,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"tiresome a display of it. Nevertheless, he is as thorough as his brother"
2287,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],in his insistence upon qualities which we have now learned to call
2288,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Romantic, and he praises all sorts of old books which no one then spoke"
2289,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"of with respect. He warmly recommends the _Morte d'Arthur_, which had"
2290,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],probably not found a single admirer since 1634. When he mentions Ben
2291,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Jonson, it is characteristic that it is to quote the line about ""the"
2292,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"charmed boats and the enchanted wharves,"" which sounds like a foretaste"
2293,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"of Keats's ""magic casements opening on the foam of perilous seas."" The"
2294,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"public of Warton's day had relegated all tales about knights, dragons,"
2295,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"and enchanters to the nursery, and Thomas Warton shows courage in"
2296,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],insisting that they are excellent subjects for serious and adult
2297,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],literature. He certainly would have thoroughly enjoyed the romances of
2298,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Mrs. Radcliffe, whom a later generation was to welcome as ""the mighty"
2299,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],magician bred and nourished by the Muses in their sacred solitary
2300,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"caverns, amid the paler shrines of Gothic superstition,"" and he despised"
2301,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the neo-classic make-believe of grottoes. He says, with firmness, that"
2302,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"epic poetry--and he is thinking of Ariosto, Tasso, and Spenser--would"
2303,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],never have been written if the critical judgments current in 1754 had
2304,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],been in vogue.
2305,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2306,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Thomas Warton closely studied the influence of Ariosto on Spenser, and"
2307,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],no other part of the _Observations_ is so valuable as the pages in which
2308,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],those two poets are contrasted. He remarked the polish of the former
2309,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"poet with approval, and he did not shrink from what is violently"
2310,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"fantastic in the plot of the _Orlando Furioso_. On that point he says,"
2311,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""The present age is too fond of manner'd poetry to relish fiction and"
2312,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"fable,"" but perhaps he did not observe that although there is no"
2313,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"chivalry in _The Schoolmistress_, that accomplished piece was the"
2314,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],indirect outcome of the Italian mock-heroic epics. The Classicists had
2315,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"fought for lucidity and common sense, whereas to be tenebrous and vague"
2316,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"was a merit with the precursors of Romanticism, or at least, without"
2317,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"unfairness, we may say that they asserted the power of imagination to"
2318,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"make what was mysterious, and even fabulous, true to the fancy. This"
2319,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"tendency, which we first perceive in the Wartons, rapidly developed, and"
2320,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],it led to the blind enthusiasm with which the vapourings of Macpherson
2321,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],were presently received. The earliest specimens of _Ossian_ were
2322,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"revealed to a too-credulous public in 1760, but I find no evidence of"
2323,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],any welcome which they received from either Joseph or Thomas. The
2324,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"brothers personally preferred a livelier and more dramatic presentation,"
2325,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"and when Dr. Johnson laughed at Collins because ""he loved fairies,"
2326,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"genii, giants, and monsters,"" the laugh was really at the expense of his"
2327,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"school-fellow Joseph Warton, to whom Collins seems to have owed his"
2328,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"boyish inspiration, although he was by a few months the senior."
2329,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2330,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Johnson was a resolute opponent of the principles of the Wartons, though"
2331,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"he held Thomas, at least, in great personal regard. He objected to the"
2332,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"brothers that they ""affected the obsolete when it was not worthy of"
2333,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"revival,"" and his boutade about their own poetry is well known:--"
2334,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2335,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""Phrase that time hath flung away,"
2336,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Uncouth words in disarray,"
2337,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Trick'd in antique ruff and bonnet,"
2338,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Ode and elegy and sonnet."""
2339,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2340,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],This conservatism was not peculiar to Johnson; there was a general
2341,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],tendency to resist the reintroduction into language and literature of
2342,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"words and forms which had been allowed to disappear. A generation later,"
2343,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],a careful and thoughtful grammarian like Gilpin was in danger of being
2344,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"dismissed as ""a cockscomb"" because he tried to enlarge our national"
2345,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],vocabulary. The Wartons were accused of searching old libraries for
2346,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],glossaries of disused terms in order to display them in their own
2347,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],writings. This was not quite an idle charge; it is to be noted as one of
2348,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],the symptoms of active Romanticism that it is always dissatisfied with
2349,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the diction commonly in use, and desires to dazzle and mystify by"
2350,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"embroidering its texture with archaic and far-fetched words. Chatterton,"
2351,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"who was not yet born when the Wartons formed and expressed their ideas,"
2352,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],was to carry this instinct to a preposterous extreme in his Rowley
2353,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"forgeries, where he tries to obtain a mediæval colouring by transferring"
2354,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"words out of an imperfect Anglo-Saxon lexicon, often without discerning"
2355,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],the actual meaning of those words.
2356,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2357,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Both the Wartons continued, in successive disquisitions, to repeat their"
2358,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"definition of poetry, but it cannot be said that either of them"
2359,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"advanced. So far as Joseph is concerned, he seems early to have"
2360,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],succumbed to the pressure of the age and of his surroundings. In 1766 he
2361,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"became head master of Winchester, and settled down after curious"
2362,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],escapades which had nothing poetical about them. In the head master of a
2363,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"great public school, reiterated murmurs against bondage to the Classical"
2364,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Greeks and Romans would have been unbecoming, and Joseph Warton was a"
2365,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"man of the world. Perhaps in the solitude of his study he murmured, as"
2366,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"disenchanted enthusiasts often murmur, ""Say, are the days of blest"
2367,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"delusion fled?"" Yet traces of the old fire were occasionally manifest;"
2368,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],still each brother woke up at intervals to censure the criticism of
2369,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"those who did not see that imagination must be paramount in poetry, and"
2370,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"who made the mistake of putting ""discernment"" in the place of"
2371,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""enthusiasm."" I hardly know why it gives me great pleasure to learn that"
2372,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"""the manner in which the Rev. Mr. Joseph Warton read the Communion"
2373,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Service was remarkably awful,"" but it must be as an evidence that he"
2374,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"carried a ""Gothick"" manner into daily life."
2375,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2376,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"The spirit of pedantry, so amicably mocked by the Wartons, took its"
2377,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"revenge upon Thomas in the form of a barren demon named Joseph Ritson,"
2378,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],who addressed to him in 1782 what he aptly called _A Familiar Letter_.
2379,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],There is hardly a more ferocious pamphlet in the whole history of
2380,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"literature. Ritson, who had the virulence of a hornet and the same"
2381,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"insect's inability to produce honey of his own, was considered by the"
2382,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"reactionaries to have ""punched Tom Warton's historick body full of"
2383,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"deadly holes."" But his strictures were not really important. In"
2384,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"marshalling some thousands of facts, Warton had made perhaps a couple of"
2385,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"dozen mistakes, and Ritson advances these with a reiteration and a"
2386,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"violence worthy of a maniac. Moreover, and this is the fate of angry"
2387,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"pedants, he himself is often found to be as dustily incorrect as Warton"
2388,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"when examined by modern lights. Ritson, who accuses Warton of ""never"
2389,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"having consulted or even seen"" the books he quotes from, and of"
2390,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"intentionally swindling the public, was in private life a vegetarian who"
2391,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],is said to have turned his orphan nephew on to the streets because he
2392,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"caught him eating a mutton-chop. Ritson flung his arrows far and wide,"
2393,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"for he called Dr. Samuel Johnson himself ""that great luminary, or rather"
2394,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"dark lantern of literature."""
2395,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2396,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"If we turn over Ritson's distasteful pages, it is only to obtain from"
2397,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],them further proof of the perception of Warton's Romanticism by an
2398,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],adversary whom hatred made perspicacious. Ritson abuses the _History of
2399,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"English Poetry_ for presuming to have ""rescued from oblivion irregular"
2400,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"beauties"" of which no one desired to be reminded. He charges Warton with"
2401,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"recommending the poetry of ""our Pagan fathers"" because it is untouched"
2402,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"by Christianity, and of saying that ""religion and poetry are"
2403,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"incompatible."" He accuses him of ""constantly busying himself with"
2404,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"passages which he does not understand, because they appeal to his ear"
2405,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"or his fancy."" ""Old poetry,"" Ritson says to Warton, ""is the same thing"
2406,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"to you, sense or nonsense."" He dwells on Warton's marked attraction to"
2407,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],whatever is prodigious and impossible. The manner in which these
2408,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],accusations are made is insolent and detestable; but Ritson had
2409,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"penetration, and without knowing what he reached, in some of these"
2410,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],diatribes he pierced to the heart of the Romanticist fallacy.
2411,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2412,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],It is needful that I should bring these observations to a close. I hope
2413,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],I have made good my claim that it was the Wartons who introduced into
2414,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],the discussion of English poetry the principle of Romanticism. To use a
2415,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"metaphor of which both of them would have approved, that principle was"
2416,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"to them like the mystical bowl of ichor, the _ampolla_, which Astolpho"
2417,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],was expected to bring down from heaven in the _Orlando Furioso_. If I
2418,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],have given you an exaggerated idea of the extent to which they foresaw
2419,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the momentous change in English literature, I am to blame. No doubt by"
2420,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"extracting a great number of slight and minute remarks, and by putting"
2421,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"them together, the critic may produce an effect which is too emphatic."
2422,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],But you will be on your guard against such misdirection. It is enough
2423,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"for me if you will admit the priority of the intuition of the brothers,"
2424,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],and I do not think that it can be contested.
2425,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2426,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"Thomas Warton said, ""I have rejected the ideas of men who are the most"
2427,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"distinguished ornaments"" of the history of English poetry, and he"
2428,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"appealed against a ""mechanical"" attitude towards the art of poetry. The"
2429,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],brothers did more in rebelling against the Classic formulas than in
2430,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"starting new poetic methods. There was an absence in them of ""the pomps"
2431,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"and prodigality"" of genius of which Gray spoke in a noble stanza. They"
2432,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"began with enthusiasm, but they had no native richness of expression, no"
2433,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"store of energy. It needed a nature as unfettered as Blake's, as wide"
2434,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"as Wordsworth's, as opulent as Keats's, to push the Romantic attack on"
2435,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"to victory. The instinct for ecstasy, ravishment, the caprices and"
2436,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"vagaries of emotion, was there; there was present in both brothers,"
2437,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"while they were still young, an extreme sensibility. The instinct was"
2438,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"present in them, but the sacred fire died out in the vacuum of their"
2439,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"social experience, and neither Warton had the energy to build up a style"
2440,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"in prose or verse. They struggled for a little while, and then they"
2441,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"succumbed to the worn verbiage of their age, from which it is sometimes"
2442,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],no light task to disengage their thought. In their later days they made
2443,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"some sad defections, and I can never forgive Thomas Warton for arriving"
2444,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],at Marlowe's _Hero and Leander_ and failing to observe its beauties. We
2445,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"are told that as Camden Professor he ""suffered the rostrum to grow"
2446,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"cold,"" and he was an ineffective poet laureate. His brother Joseph felt"
2447,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"the necessity or the craving for lyrical expression, without attaining"
2448,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],more than a muffled and a second-rate effect.
2449,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],
2450,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],All this has to be sadly admitted. But the fact remains that between
2451,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"1740 and 1750, while even the voice of Rousseau had not begun to make"
2452,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"itself heard in Europe, the Wartons had discovered the fallacy of the"
2453,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"poetic theories admitted in their day, and had formed some faint"
2454,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],conception of a mode of escape from them. The Abbé Du Bos had laid down
2455,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],in his celebrated _Réflexions_ (1719) that the poet's art consists of
2456,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"making a general moral representation of incidents and scenes, and"
2457,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],embellishing it with elegant images. This had been accepted and acted
2458,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],upon by Pope and by all his followers. To have been the first to
2459,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],perceive the inadequacy and the falsity of a law which excluded all
2460,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"imagination, all enthusiasm, and all mystery, is to demand respectful"
2461,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],"attention from the historian of Romanticism, and this attention is due"
2462,JOSEPH AND THOMAS WARTON[4],to Joseph and Thomas Warton.

2473,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"It is exactly two hundred years to-night since there was born, at"
2474,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Clonmel, in Ireland, a son to a subaltern in an English regiment just"
2475,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"home from the Low Countries. ""My birthday,"" Laurence Sterne tells us,"
2476,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"""was ominous to my poor father, who was, the day after our arrival, with"
2477,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"many other brave officers, broke and sent adrift into the wide world"
2478,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"with a wife and two children."" The life of the new baby was one of"
2479,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"perpetual hurry and scurry; his mother, who had been an old campaigner,"
2480,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"daughter of what her son calls ""a noted suttler"" called Nuttle, had been"
2481,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],the widow of a soldier before she married Roger Sterne. In the
2482,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"extraordinary fashion of the army of those days, the regiment was"
2483,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],hurried from place to place--as was that of the father of the infant
2484,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Borrow a century later--and with it hastened the unhappy Mrs. Sterne,"
2485,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"for ever bearing and for ever losing children, ""most rueful journeys,"""
2486,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"marked by a long succession of little tombstones left behind. Finally,"
2487,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"at Gibraltar, the weary father, pugnacious to the last, picked a quarrel"
2488,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"about a goose and was pinked through the body, surviving in a thoroughly"
2489,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"damaged condition, to die, poor exhausted pilgrim of Bellona, in"
2490,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],barracks in Jamaica.
2491,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2492,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],It would be difficult to imagine a childhood better calculated than this
2493,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],to encourage pathos in a humorist and fun in a sentimentalist. His
2494,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"account, in his brief autobiography, of the appearance and"
2495,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],disappearance of his hapless brothers and sisters is a proof of how
2496,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],early life appealed to Laurence Sterne in the dappled colours of an
2497,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"April day. We read there of how at Wicklow ""we lost poor Joram, a pretty"
2498,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"boy""; how ""Anne, that pretty blossom, fell in the barracks of Dublin"";"
2499,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"how little Devijehar was ""left behind"" in Carrickfergus. We know not"
2500,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"whether to sob or to giggle, so tragic is the rapid catalogue of dying"
2501,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"babies, so ridiculous are their names and fates. Here, then, I think, we"
2502,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"have revealed to us the prime characteristic of Sterne, from which all"
2503,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"his other characteristics branch away, for evil or for good. As no other"
2504,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"writer since Shakespeare, and in a different and perhaps more intimate"
2505,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"way than even Shakespeare, he possessed the key of those tears that"
2506,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"succeed the hysteria of laughter, and of that laughter which succeeds"
2507,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"the passion of tears. From early childhood, and all through youth and"
2508,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"manhood, he had been collecting observations upon human nature in these"
2509,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],rapidly alternating moods.
2510,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2511,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"He observed it in its frailty, but being exquisitely frail himself, he"
2512,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],was no satirist. A breath of real satire would blow down the whole
2513,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],delicate fabric of _Tristram Shandy_ and the _Sentimental Journey_.
2514,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],Sterne pokes fun at people and things; he banters the extravagance of
2515,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],private humour; but it is always with a consciousness that he is himself
2516,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],more extravagant than any one. If we compare him for a moment with
2517,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Richardson, who buttonholes the reader in a sermon; or with Smollett,"
2518,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],who snarls and bites like an angry beast; we feel at once that Sterne
2519,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],could not breathe in the stuffiness of the one or in the tempest of the
2520,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"other. Sympathy is the breath of his nostrils, and he cannot exist"
2521,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"except in a tender, merry relation with his readers. His own ideal,"
2522,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"surely, is that which he attributed to the fantastic and gentle Yorick,"
2523,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"who never could enter a village, but he caught the attention of old and"
2524,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"young. ""Labour stood still as he passed; the bucket hung suspended in"
2525,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"the middle of the well; the spinning-wheel forgot its round, even"
2526,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],chuck-farthing and shuffle-cap themselves stood gaping till he had got
2527,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"out of sight."" Like Yorick, Sterne loved a jest in his heart."
2528,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2529,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"There are, it seems to me, two distinct strains in the intellectual"
2530,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"development of Sterne, and I should like to dwell upon them for a"
2531,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"moment, because I think a lack of recognition of them has been apt to"
2532,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],darken critical counsel in the consideration of his writings. You will
2533,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],remember that he was forty-six years of age before he took up the
2534,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],business of literature seriously. Until that time he had been a country
2535,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"parson in Yorkshire, carrying his body, that ""cadaverous bale of goods,"""
2536,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"from Sutton to Stillington, and from Stillington to Skelton. He had"
2537,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"spent his life in riding, shooting, preaching, joking, and philandering"
2538,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"in company, and after a fashion, most truly reprehensible from a"
2539,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"clerical point of view, yet admirably fitted to prepare such an artist"
2540,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],for his destined labours as a painter of the oddities of average
2541,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],Englishmen. But by the side of this indolent search after the enjoyment
2542,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"of the hour, Sterne cultivated a formidable species of literature in"
2543,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"which he had so few competitors that, in after years, his indolence"
2544,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"prompted him to plagiarise freely from sources which, surely, no human"
2545,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],being would discover. He steeped himself in the cumbrous learning of
2546,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],those writers of the Renaissance in whom congested Latin is found
2547,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],tottering into colloquial French. He studied Rabelais perhaps more
2548,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"deeply than any other Englishman of his time, and certainly Beroalde de"
2549,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Verville, Bruscambille, and other absurdities of the sixteenth century"
2550,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],were familiar to him and to him alone in England.
2551,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2552,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Hence, when Sterne began to write, there were two streams flowing in his"
2553,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"brain, and these were, like everything else about him, inconsistent with"
2554,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],one another. The faithful tender colour of modern life competed with
2555,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],the preposterous oddity of burlesque erudition. When he started the
2556,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"annals of Tristram Shandy, the Rabelais vein was in the ascendant, and"
2557,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],there is plenty of evidence that it vastly dazzled and entertained
2558,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"readers of that day. But it no longer entertains us very much, and it is"
2559,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],the source of considerable injustice done by modern criticism to the
2560,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],real merits of Sterne. When so acute a writer as Bagehot condemns much
2561,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"of _Tristram Shandy_ as ""a sort of antediluvian fun, in which uncouth"
2562,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"saurian jokes play idly in an unintelligible world,"" he hits the nail on"
2563,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],the head of why so many readers nowadays turn with impatience from that
2564,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"work. But they should persevere, for Sterne himself saw his error, and"
2565,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"gradually dropped the ""uncouth saurian jokes"" which he had filched out"
2566,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"of Burton and Beroalde, relying more and more exclusively on his own"
2567,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],rich store of observations taken directly from human nature. In the
2568,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"adorable seventh volume of _Tristram_, and in _The Sentimental Journey_,"
2569,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],there is nothing left of Rabelais except a certain rambling artifice of
2570,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],style.
2571,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2572,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"The death of Sterne, at the age of fifty-four, is one of those events"
2573,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"which must be continually regretted, because to the very end of his life"
2574,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"he was growing in ease and ripeness, was discovering more perfect modes"
2575,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"of self-expression, and was purging himself of his compromising"
2576,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],intellectual frailties. It is true that from the very first his
2577,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"excellences were patent. The portrait of my Uncle Toby, which Hazlitt"
2578,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"truly said is ""one of the finest compliments ever paid to human nature,"""
2579,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"occurs, or rather begins, in the second volume of _Tristram Shandy_. But"
2580,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],the marvellous portraits which the early sections of that work contain
2581,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"are to some extent obscured, or diluted, by the author's determination"
2582,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"to gain piquancy by applying old methods to new subjects. Frankly, much"
2583,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"as I love Sterne, I find Kunastrockius and Lithopaedus a bore. I suspect"
2584,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],they have driven more than one modern reader away from the enjoyment of
2585,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],_Tristram Shandy_.
2586,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2587,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Towards the end of the eighteenth century a leading Dissenting minister,"
2588,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"the Rev. Joseph Fawcett, said in answer to a question: ""Do I _like_"
2589,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Sterne? Yes, to be sure I should deserve to be hanged if I didn't!"" That"
2590,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],was the attitude of thoughtful and scrupulous people of cultivation more
2591,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],than one hundred years ago. But it was their attitude only on some
2592,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"occasions. There is no record of the fact, but I am ready to believe"
2593,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"that Mr. Fawcett may, with equal sincerity, have said that Sterne was a"
2594,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],godless wretch. We know that Bishop Warburton presented him with a purse
2595,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"of gold, in rapturous appreciation of his talents, and then in a"
2596,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"different mood described him as ""an irrevocable scoundrel."" No one else"
2597,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],has ever flourished in literature who has combined such alternating
2598,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],powers of attraction and repulsion. We like Sterne extremely at one
2599,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"moment, and we dislike him no less violently at another. He is attar of"
2600,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"roses to-day and asafoetida to-morrow, and it is not by any means easy"
2601,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],to define the elements which draw us towards him and away from him. Like
2602,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Yorick, he had ""a wild way of talking,"" and he wrote impetuously and"
2603,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"impudently ""in the naked temper which a merry heart discovered."" As he"
2604,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"""seldom shunned occasions of saying what came uppermost, and without"
2605,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"much ceremony, he had but too many temptations in life of scattering his"
2606,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"wit and his humour, his gibes and his jests, about him."""
2607,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2608,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"So that even if he had been merely Yorick, Sterne would have had"
2609,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],manifold opportunities of giving offence and causing scandal. But lie
2610,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"was not only a humorist with ""a thousand little sceptical notions to"
2611,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"defend,"" but he was a sentimentalist as well. Those two characteristics"
2612,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"he was constantly mingling, or trying to mingle, since sentimentality"
2613,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],and humour are in reality like oil and wine. He would exasperate his
2614,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],readers by throwing his wig in their faces at the moment when they were
2615,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"weeping, or put them out of countenance by ending a farcical story on a"
2616,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],melancholy note. A great majority of Englishmen like to be quite sure of
2617,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],the tone of what they read; they wish an author to be straightforward;
2618,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],they dread irony and they loathe impishness. Now Sterne is the most
2619,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"impish of all imaginative writers. He is what our grandmothers, in"
2620,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"describing the vagaries of the nursery, used to call ""a limb of Satan."""
2621,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Tristram Shandy, in his light-hearted way, declared that ""there's not so"
2622,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"much difference between good and evil as the world is apt to imagine."""
2623,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"No doubt that is so, but the world does not like its preachers to play"
2624,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],fast and loose with moral definitions.
2625,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2626,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"The famous sensibility of Sterne was a reaction against the seriousness,"
2627,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"the ponderosity, of previous prose literature in England. We talk of the"
2628,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"heaviness of the eighteenth century, but the periods of even such"
2629,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],masters of solid rhetoric as Johnson and Gibbon are light as thistledown
2630,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],in comparison with the academic prose of the seventeenth century. Before
2631,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"the eighteenth century is called lumbering, let us set a page of Hume"
2632,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"against a page of Hobbes, or a passage out of Berkeley by a passage out"
2633,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],of Selden. Common justice is seldom done to the steady clarification of
2634,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"English prose between 1660 and 1750, but it was kept within formal lines"
2635,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"until the sensitive recklessness of Sterne broke up the mould, and gave"
2636,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],it the flying forms of a cloud or a wave. He owed this beautiful
2637,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"inspiration to what Nietzsche calls his ""squirrel-soul,"" which leaped"
2638,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"from bough to bough, and responded without a trace of conventional"
2639,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],restraint to every gust of emotion. Well might Goethe be inspired to
2640,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],declare that Sterne was the most emancipated spirit of his century.
2641,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2642,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],His very emancipation gives us the reason why Sterne's admirers nowadays
2643,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],are often divided in their allegiance to him. A frequent part of his
2644,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],humour deals very flippantly with subjects that are what we have been
2645,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],taught to consider indelicate or objectionable. It is worse than useless
2646,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"to try to explain this foible of his away, because he was aware of it"
2647,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"and did it on purpose. He said that ""nothing but the more gross and"
2648,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"carnal parts of a composition will go down."" His indecency was objected"
2649,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"to in his own age, but not with any excluding severity. And I would like"
2650,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],to call your attention to the curious conventionality of our views on
2651,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"this subject. Human nature does not change, but it changes its modes of"
2652,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"expression. In the eighteenth century very grave people, even bishops,"
2653,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"allowed themselves, in their relaxed moments, great licence in jesting."
2654,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],Yet they would have been scandalised by the tragic treatment of sex by
2655,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],our more audacious novelists of to-day. We are still interested in these
2656,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"matters, but we have agreed not to joke about them. I read the other day"
2657,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],a dictum of one of those young gentlemen who act as our moral policemen:
2658,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"he prophesied that a jest on a sexual subject would, in twenty years, be"
2659,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"not merely reprehensible, as it is now, but unintelligible. Very proper,"
2660,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"no doubt, only do not let us call this morality, it is only a change of"
2661,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],habits.
2662,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2663,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],Sterne is not suited to readers who are disheartened at irrelevancy. It
2664,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"is part of his charm, and it is at the same time his most whimsical"
2665,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"habit, never to proceed with his story when you expect him to do so, and"
2666,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],to be reminded by his own divagations of delightful side-issues which
2667,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"lead you, entranced, whither you had no intention of going. He did not"
2668,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"merely not shun occasions of being irrelevant, but he sought them out"
2669,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],and eagerly cultivated them. Remember that a whole chapter of _Tristram_
2670,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],is devoted to the _attitude_ of Corporal Trim as he prepared himself to
2671,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"read the Sermon. Sterne kept a stable of prancing, plump little"
2672,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"hobby-horses, and he trotted them out upon every occasion. But this is"
2673,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],what makes his books the best conversational writing in the English
2674,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],language. He writes for all the world exactly as though he were talking
2675,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"at his ease, and we listen enchanted to the careless, frolicking, idle,"
2676,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"penetrating speaker who builds up for us so nonchalantly, with"
2677,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"persistent but unobtrusive touch upon touch, the immortal figures of Mr."
2678,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Shandy, my Uncle Toby, Trim, Yorick, the Widow Wadman, and so many more."
2679,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2680,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"This, I am inclined to think, in drawing this brief sketch to an end, is"
2681,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],Sterne's main interest for ourselves. He broke up the rhetorical manner
2682,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"of composition, or, rather, he produced an alternative manner which was"
2683,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],gradually accepted and is in partial favour still. I would ask you to
2684,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],read for yourselves the scene of the ass who blocked the way for
2685,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Tristram at Lyons, and to consider how completely new that method of"
2686,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"describing, of facing a literary problem, was in 1765. I speak here to"
2687,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"an audience of experts, to a company of authors who are accustomed to a"
2688,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],close consideration of the workmanship of their _métier_. I ask them
2689,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"where, at all events in English, anything like that scene had been found"
2690,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],before the days of Sterne. Since those days we have never been without
2691,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],it.
2692,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],
2693,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],To trace the Shandean influence down English literature for the last
2694,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],century and a half would take me much too long for your patience. In
2695,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"Dickens, in Carlyle, even in Ruskin, the Shandean element is often"
2696,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],present and not rarely predominant. None of those great men would have
2697,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],expressed himself exactly as he does but for Laurence Sterne. And coming
2698,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"down to our own time, I see the influence of Sterne everywhere. The"
2699,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],pathos of Sir James Barrie is intimately related to that of the creator
2700,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],"of Uncle Toby and Maria of Moulines, while I am not sure that of all the"
2701,THE CHARM OF STERNE[5],books which Stevenson read it was not the _Sentimental Journey_ which

2712,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2713,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,In the announcements of the approaching celebration of the centenary of
2714,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Poe in this country, the fact of his having been a poet was concealed."
2715,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Perhaps his admirers hoped that it might be overlooked, as without"
2716,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"importance, or condoned as the result of bad habits. At all events, the"
2717,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,statement that the revels on that occasion would be conducted by Sir
2718,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Arthur Conan Doyle was quite enough to prove that it was the prose
2719,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"writer of ""The Black Cat"" and ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue,"" and not"
2720,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"the verso writer of ""Ulalume"" and ""Annabel Lee"" who would be the centre"
2721,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"of attention. On that side of Poe's genius, therefore, although it is"
2722,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"illustrated by such masterpieces of sullen beauty as ""The Fall of the"
2723,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"House of Usher"" and such triumphs of fantastic ingenuity as ""The Gold"
2724,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Bug,"" I feel it needless to dwell here, the more as I think the"
2725,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,importance of these tales very slight by the side of that of the best
2726,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"poems. Edgar Poe was, in my opinion, one of the most significant poetic"
2727,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"artists of a century rich in poetic artists, and I hold it to be for"
2728,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"this reason, and not because he wrote thrilling ""detective"" stories,"
2729,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,that he deserves persistent commemoration.
2730,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2731,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,The dominance of Poe as an important poetic factor of the nineteenth
2732,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"century has not been easily or universally admitted, and it is only"
2733,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,natural to examine both the phenomena and the causes of the objections
2734,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"so persistently brought against it. In the first instance, if the fame"
2735,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"of Browning and Tennyson advanced slowly, it advanced firmly, and it"
2736,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"was encouraged from the beginning by the experts, by the cultivated"
2737,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"minority. Poe, on the other hand, was challenged, and his credentials"
2738,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"were grudgingly inspected, by those who represented the finest culture"
2739,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"of his own country, and the carpings of New England criticism are not"
2740,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"quite silent yet. When he died, in 1849, the tribunal of American"
2741,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"letters sat at Cambridge, in the neighbourhood of Boston, and it was"
2742,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,ill-prepared to believe that anything poetical could deserve salvation
2743,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"if it proceeded from a place outside the magic circle. Edgar Poe, the"
2744,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"son of Irish strolling players, called ""The Virginia Comedians,"" settled"
2745,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"in the South and was educated in England. By an odd coincidence, it now"
2746,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"appears that he actually was a native, as it were by accident, of Boston"
2747,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"itself. In the words of the Psalmist, ""Lo! there was he born!"" This"
2748,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Gentile poet, such was the then state of American literature, could not"
2749,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,arrive on earth elsewhere than in the Jerusalem of Massachusetts. But
2750,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"that concession was not known to the high priests, the Lowells, the"
2751,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Holmeses, the Nortons, to whom Poe seemed a piratical intruder from"
2752,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Javan or Gadire.
2753,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2754,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Nothing is so discouraging to a young poet of originality as to find
2755,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,himself isolated. Everything new is regarded with suspicion and dislike
2756,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"by the general world of readers, and usually by the leaders of criticism"
2757,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,as well. Yet the daring prophet feels supported if he has but his Aaron
2758,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"and his Hur. In the generation that immediately preceded Poe, Wordsworth"
2759,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"and Coleridge had been derided, but they had enjoyed the emphatic"
2760,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,approbation of one another and of Southey. Shelley had been a pariah of
2761,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"letters, yet he was cordially believed in by Byron and by Peacock. Even"
2762,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Keats could shrink from the mud-storms of the Scotch reviewers behind
2763,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,the confident zeal of Leigh Hunt and Reynolds. At a still later moment
2764,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Rossetti and Morris would shelter themselves securely, and even"
2765,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"serenely, from the obloquy of criticism, within a slender peel-tower of"
2766,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,the praise of friends. In all these cases there could be set against the
2767,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,stupidity of the world at large the comfortable cleverness of a few
2768,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"strong persons of taste, founded, as all good taste must be, upon"
2769,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"principles. The poet could pride himself on his eclecticism, on his"
2770,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"recognition within, as Keats said, ""a little clan."" But Poe's misfortune"
2771,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"was to have no clan of his own, and to be rejected by precisely those"
2772,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"persons who represented, and on the whole justly represented, good taste"
2773,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,in America.
2774,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2775,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,His behaviour in this predicament was what might have been expected from
2776,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,a man whose genius was more considerable than his judgment or his
2777,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"manners. He tried, at first, to conciliate the New England authorities,"
2778,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,and he flattered not merely the greater planets but some of the very
2779,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"little stars. He danced, a plaintive Salome, before Christopher P."
2780,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Cranch and Nathaniel P. Willis. When he found that his blandishments
2781,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"were of no avail, he turned savage, and tried to prove that he did not"
2782,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"care, by being rude to Bryant and Longfellow. He called the whole solemn"
2783,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Sanhedrim a college of Frog-pondian professors. Thus, of course, he"
2784,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"closed upon himself the doors of mercy, since the central aim and object"
2785,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,of the excellent men who at that time ruled American literature was to
2786,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"prove that, in what this impertinent young man from Virginia called the"
2787,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Frog Pond, the United States possessed its Athens and its Weimar, its"
2788,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"home of impeccable distinction. Indeed, but for the recognition of"
2789,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Europe, which began to flow in richly just as Poe ceased to be able to"
2790,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"enjoy it, the prestige of this remarkable poet might have been"
2791,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,successfully annihilated.
2792,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2793,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Nor was it only the synod of Boston wits who issued the edict that he
2794,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"should be ignored, but in England also many good judges of literature,"
2795,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,especially those who belonged to the intellectual rather than the
2796,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"artistic class, could not away with him. I recollect hearing Leslie"
2797,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Stephen say, now nearly thirty years ago, that to employ strong terms of"
2798,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"praise for Poe was ""simply preposterous."" And one whom I admire so"
2799,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,implicitly that I will not mention his name in a context which is not
2800,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"favourable to his judgment, wrote (in his haste) of Poe's ""singularly"
2801,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"valueless verses."""
2802,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2803,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"This opposition, modified, it is true, by the very different attitude"
2804,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"adopted by Tennyson and most subsequent English poets, as well as by"
2805,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Baudelaire, Mallarmé and the whole younger school in France, was"
2806,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"obstinately preserved, and has not wholly subsided. It would be a"
2807,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,tactical mistake for those who wish to insist on Poe's supremacy in his
2808,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,own line to ignore the serious resistance which has been made to it. In
2809,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"the canonisation-trial of this whimsical saint, the Devil's advocates,"
2810,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"it may be confessed, are many, and their objections are imposing. It is"
2811,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,possible that local pique and a horror of certain crude surroundings may
2812,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,have had something to do with the original want of recognition in New
2813,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"England, but such sources of prejudice would be ephemeral. There"
2814,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"remained, and has continued to remain, in the very essence of Poe's"
2815,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"poetry, something which a great many sincere and penetrating lovers of"
2816,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,verse cannot endure to admit as a dominant characteristic of the art.
2817,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2818,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,To recognise the nature of this quality is to take the first step
2819,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,towards discovering the actual essence of Poe's genius. His detractors
2820,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"have said that his verses are ""singularly valueless."" It is therefore"
2821,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"necessary to define what it is they mean by ""value."" If they mean an"
2822,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"inculcation, in beautiful forms, of moral truth; if they mean a"
2823,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"succession of ideas, clothed in exalted and yet definite language; if"
2824,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,they are thinking of what stirs the heart in reading parts of _Hamlet_
2825,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"and _Comus_, of what keeps the pulse vibrating after the ""Ode to Duty"""
2826,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,has been recited; then the verses of Poe are indeed without value. A
2827,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"poet less gnomic than Poe, one from whom less, as they say in the"
2828,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"suburbs, ""can be learned,"" is scarcely to be found in the whole range of"
2829,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,literature. His lack of curiosity about moral ideas is so complete that
2830,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,evil moves him no more than good. There have been writers of eccentric
2831,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,or perverse morality who have been so much irritated by the preaching of
2832,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,virtue that they have lent their genius to the recommendation of vice.
2833,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,This inversion of moral fervour is perhaps the source of most that is
2834,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"vaguely called ""immoral"" in imaginative literature. But Edgar Poe is as"
2835,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,innocent of immorality as he is of morality. No more innocuous flowers
2836,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,than his are grown through the length and breadth of Parnassus. There is
2837,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,hardly a phrase in his collected writings which has a bearing upon any
2838,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"ethical question, and those who look for what Wordsworth called ""chains"
2839,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"of valuable thoughts"" must go elsewhere."
2840,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2841,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"In 1840 they might, in New England, go to Bryant, to Emerson, to"
2842,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Hawthorne; and it is more than excusable that those who were
2843,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,endeavouring to refine the very crude community in the midst of which
2844,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"they were anxiously holding up the agate lamp of Psyche, should see"
2845,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,nothing to applaud in the vague and shadowy rhapsodies then being issued
2846,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,by a dissipated hack in Philadelphia. What the New England critics
2847,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"wanted, patriotically as well as personally, was as little like"
2848,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"""Ulalume"" as can possibly be conceived. They defined what poetry should"
2849,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,be--there was about that time a mania for defining poetry--and what
2850,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,their definition was may be seen no less plainly in the American _Fable
2851,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,for Critics_ than in the preface to the English _Philip van Artevelde_.
2852,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"It was to be picturesque, intellectual, pleasing; it was to deal, above"
2853,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"all, with moral ""truths""; it was to avoid vagueness and to give no"
2854,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"uncertain sound; it was to regard ""passion"" with alarm, as the siren"
2855,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,which was bound sooner or later to fling a bard upon the rocks. It is
2856,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"not necessary to treat this conception of poetry with scorn, nor to"
2857,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"reject principles of precise thought and clear, sober language, which"
2858,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,had been illustrated by Wordsworth in the present and by Gray in the
2859,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"past. The ardent young critics of our own age, having thrown off all"
2860,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"respect for the traditions of literature, speak and write as if to them,"
2861,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"and them alone, had been divinely revealed the secrets of taste. They do"
2862,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,not give themselves time to realise that in Apollo's house there are
2863,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,many mansions.
2864,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2865,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,It is sufficient for us to note here that the discomfort of Poe's
2866,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,position resided in the fact that he was not admitted into so much as
2867,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,the forecourt of the particular mansion inhabited by Bryant and Lowell.
2868,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"There is a phrase in one of his own rather vague and ""valueless"" essays"
2869,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"(for Poe was a poor critic) which, as it were accidentally, describes"
2870,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"his ideal in poetry, although it is not his own verse of which he is"
2871,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"speaking. He described--in 1845, when his ripe genius had just brought"
2872,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"forth ""The Raven""--the poetic faculty as producing ""a sense of dreamy,"
2873,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight."" This"
2874,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,shadowy but absorbing and mastering pleasure impregnated his own best
2875,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,writings to such a degree that it gives us the measure of his unlikeness
2876,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"to his contemporaries, and states the claim of his individuality."
2877,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Without precisely knowing it or perceiving his revolution, in an age of"
2878,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"intelligent, tame, lucid and cautiously-defined poetry, Edgar Poe"
2879,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"expressed the emotions which surged within him in numbers that were,"
2880,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"even to excess, ""dreamy, wild, indefinite and indefinable."""
2881,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2882,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,His early verses are remarkably exempt from the influences which we
2883,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"might expect to find impressed on them. He imitated, as every man of"
2884,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"genuine originality imitates while he learns his trade, but his models"
2885,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"were not, as might have been anticipated, Coleridge and Shelley; they"
2886,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"were Byron and Scott. In the poetry of Byron and Scott, Poe found"
2887,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"nothing to transfer to his own nature, and the early imitations,"
2888,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"therefore, left no trace on him. Brief as is the volume of his poems,"
2889,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,half of it might be discarded without much regret. Scattered among his
2890,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Byron and Scott imitations, however, we find a few pieces which reveal"
2891,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"to us that, while he was still almost a child, the true direction of his"
2892,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"genius was occasionally revealed to him. The lyric ""To Helen,"" which is"
2893,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"said to have been composed in his fourteenth year, is steeped in the"
2894,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"peculiar purity, richness and vagueness which were to characterise his"
2895,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,mature poems:--
2896,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2897,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"""On desperate seas long wont to roam,"
2898,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,"
2899,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
2900,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"To the glory that was Greece,"
2901,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"And the grandeur that was Rome."""
2902,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2903,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"This was not published, however, until the author was two-and-twenty,"
2904,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,and it may have been touched up. Here is a fragment of a suppressed
2905,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"poem, ""Visit of the Dead,"" which Poe certainly printed in his eighteenth"
2906,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,year:--
2907,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2908,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"""The breeze, the breath of God, is still,"
2909,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"And the mist upon the hill,"
2910,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Shadowy, shadowy, yet unbroken,"
2911,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Is a symbol and a token;
2912,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"How it hangs upon the trees,"
2913,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"A mystery of mysteries!"""
2914,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2915,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"This is not so perfect, but it is even more than ""To Helen"" symptomatic"
2916,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,of Poe's peculiar relation to the poetic faculty as fostering a state of
2917,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,indefinite and indeed indefinable delight. And from these faint
2918,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,breathings how direct is the advance to such incomparable specimens of
2919,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"symbolic fancy as ""The City in the Sea,"" ""The Sleeper,"" and finally"
2920,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"""Ulalume""!"
2921,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2922,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"The determination to celebrate, in a minor key, indefinite and"
2923,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"melancholy symbols of fancy, is a snare than which none more dangerous"
2924,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"can be placed in the path of a feeble foot. But Poe was not feeble, and"
2925,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"he was protected, and permanent value was secured for his poetry, by the"
2926,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,possession of one or two signal gifts to which attention must now be
2927,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"paid. He cultivated the indefinite, but, happily for us, in language so"
2928,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"definite and pure that when he succeeds it is with a cool fulness, an"
2929,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"absence of all fretting and hissing sound, such as can rarely be"
2930,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,paralleled in English literature. The finest things in Milton's 1645
2931,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"volume, Wordsworth at his very best, Tennyson occasionally, Collins in"
2932,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"some of his shorter odes, have reached that perfection of syllabic"
2933,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"sweetness, that clear sound of a wave breaking on the twilight sands,"
2934,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"which Poe contrives to render, without an effort, again and again:--"
2935,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2936,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"""By a route obscure and lonely,"
2937,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Haunted by ill angels only,"

2939,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"On a black throne reigns upright,"
2940,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,I have reached these lands but newly
2941,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"From an ultimate dim Thule,"
2942,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"From a wild weird clime, that lieth, sublime."
2943,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Out of space, out of time."""
2944,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2945,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,The present moment is one in which the reaction against plastic beauty
2946,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,in poetry has reached such a height that it is almost vain to appeal
2947,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,against it. There is scarcely a single English poet of consequence in
2948,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,the younger school who does not treat the strings of his lyre as though
2949,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,he were preluding with a slate-pencil upon a slate. That this is done
2950,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"purposely, and in accordance with mysterious harmonic laws entirely"
2951,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"beyond the comprehension of ordinary ears, makes the matter worse. There"
2952,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,is no heresiarch so dangerous as the priest of holy and self-abnegating
2953,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"life, and it is to a poet no less learned than Mr. Robert Bridges, that"
2954,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,the twentieth century seems to owe the existing rage for cacophony. He
2955,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"holds something of the same place in relation to Swinburne and Poe, that"
2956,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Donne did to Spenser three hundred years ago. In this condition of
2957,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,things it may seem useless to found any claim for Poe on the ground of
2958,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"the exquisite mellifluousness of his versification. We may hope,"
2959,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"however, some day to regain the use of our ears, and to discover once"
2960,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,more that music and metre are utterly distinct arts. When that
2961,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"re-discovery has been made, Poe will resume his position as one of the"
2962,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,most uniformly melodious of all those who have used the English
2963,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,language.
2964,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2965,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Critics who have admitted the extraordinary perfection of his prosody
2966,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"have occasionally objected that in the most popular examples of it, ""The"
2967,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Raven"" and ""The Bells,"" he obtains his effect by a trick. It might be"
2968,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"objected, with equal force, that Victor Hugo in ""Les Djinns"" and even"
2969,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Tennyson in ""The Lotus Eaters"" made use of ""tricks."" On the other hand,"
2970,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"if the charge be deserved, it seems odd that in the course of nearly"
2971,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,seventy years no other juggler or conjurer has contrived to repeat the
2972,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,wonderful experiment. In each poem there are what must be judged
2973,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,definite errors against taste in detail--Poe's taste was never very
2974,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"sure--but the skill of the long voluptuous lamentation, broken at equal"
2975,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"intervals by the croak of the raven, and that of the verbal translation,"
2976,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"as if into four tones or languages, of the tintinabulation of the bells,"
2977,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"is so extraordinary, so original, and so closely in keeping with the"
2978,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"personal genius of the writer, that it is surely affectation to deny its"
2979,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,value.
2980,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
2981,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"It is not, however, in ""The Bells"" or in ""The Raven,"" marvellous as are"
2982,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"these _tours de force_, that we see the essential greatness of Poe"
2983,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,revealed. The best of his poems are those in which he deals less
2984,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,boisterously with the sentiment of mystery. During the latest months of
2985,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"his unhappy life, he composed three lyrics which, from a technical"
2986,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"point of view, must be regarded not only as the most interesting, which"
2987,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"he wrote, but as those which have had the most permanent effect upon"
2988,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"subsequent literature, not in England merely, but in France. These are"
2989,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"""Ulalume,"" ""Annabel Lee,"" ""For Annie."" One of Poe's greatest inventions"
2990,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"was the liquidation of stanzaic form, by which he was able to mould it"
2991,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,to the movements of emotion without losing its essential structure. Many
2992,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,poets had done this with the line; it was left for Poe to do it with the
2993,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,stanza. In the three latest lyrics this stanzaic legerdemain is
2994,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"practised with an enchanting lightness, an ecstasy of sinuous and"
2995,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"elastic grace. Perhaps, had it been subjected to the poet's latest"
2996,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"revision, ""For Annie"" would have been the most wonderful of all in the"
2997,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,sensitive response of its metre to the delicate fluctuations of
2998,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,sentiment.
2999,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
3000,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"We may, then, briefly summarise that Poe's first claim to commemoration"
3001,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,is that he was the pioneer in restoring to the art of poetry a faculty
3002,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,which it had almost lost in its attempt to compete with science and
3003,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,philosophy. It had become the aim of the poets to state facts; it was
3004,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,given to Poe to perceive that no less splendid a future lay before those
3005,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,who only hinted feelings. He was the earliest modern poet who
3006,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,substituted the symbol for the exact description of an object or an
3007,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"event. That ""expression directe,"" about which the French have been"
3008,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"debating for the last quarter of a century, and over which M. Adolphe"
3009,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,Retté and M. Albert Mockel periodically dispute like Fathers of the
3010,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Church, was perceived and was deliberately repudiated by Poe eighty"
3011,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,years ago. He was deeply impregnated with the sense that the harmony of
3012,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"imagination is not destroyed, but developed, by drawing over a subject"
3013,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,veil after veil of suggestion. His native temperament aided him in his
3014,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"research after the symbol. He was naturally a cultivator of terror, one"
3015,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,who loved to people the world with strange and indefinable powers. His
3016,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"dreams were innocent and agitating, occupied with supernatural terrors,"
3017,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,weighed upon by the imminence of shadowy presentments. He trembled at he
3018,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,knew not what; in this he was related to the earliest poets of the
3019,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"world, and in his perpetual recurrence to symbol he recalls the action"
3020,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,of their alarms.
3021,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,
3022,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"The cardinal importance, then, of Poe as a poet is that he restored to"
3023,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,poetry a primitive faculty of which civilisation seemed successfully to
3024,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,have deprived her. He rejected the doctrinal expression of positive
3025,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"things, and he insisted upon mystery and symbol. He endeavoured to"
3026,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,clothe unfathomable thoughts and shadowy images in melody that was like
3027,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"the wind wandering over the strings of an æolian harp. In other words,"
3028,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,he was the pioneer of a school which has spread its influence to the
3029,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,"confines of the civilised world, and is now revolutionising literature."
3030,THE CENTENARY OF EDGAR ALLAN POE,He was the discoverer and the founder of Symbolism.

3043,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",One hundred and twenty years have nearly passed since the birth of
3044,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Bulwer-Lytton, and he continues to be suspended in a dim and ambiguous"
3045,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",position in the history of our literature. He combined extraordinary
3046,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","qualities with fatal defects. He aimed at the highest eminence, and"
3047,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","failed to reach it, but he was like an explorer, who is diverted from"
3048,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","the main ascent of a mountain, and yet annexes an important table-land"
3049,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",elsewhere. Bulwer-Lytton never secured the ungrudging praise of the best
3050,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","judges, but he attained great popularity, and has even now not wholly"
3051,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","lost it. He is never quoted as one of our great writers, and yet he"
3052,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",holds a place of his own from which it is improbable that he will ever
3053,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","be dislodged. Although he stood out prominently among his fellows, and"
3054,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","although his career was tinged with scandal and even with romance, very"
3055,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",little has been known about him. Curiosity has been foiled by the
3056,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",discretion of one party and the malignity of another. The public has not
3057,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","been in a position to know the truth, nor to possess the real portrait"
3058,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",of a politician and a man of letters who has been presented as an angel
3059,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","and as a gargoyle, but never as a human being. Forty years after his"
3060,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",death the candour and the skill of his grandson reveal him to us at last
3061,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",in a memoir of unusual excellence.
3062,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3063,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","In no case would Lord Lytton's task have been an easy one, but it must"
3064,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",have been made peculiarly difficult by the work of those who had
3065,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","preceded him. Of these, the only one who deserves serious attention is"
3066,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Robert Lytton, who published certain fragments in 1883. That the son"
3067,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",wished to support the memory of his father is unquestionable. But it is
3068,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",difficult to believe that he intended his contribution to be more than
3069,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",an aid to some future biographer's labour. He scattered his material
3070,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","about him in rough heaps. Apart from the ""Literary Remains,"" which"
3071,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","destroyed the continuity of even such brief biography as he gave, Robert"
3072,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Lytton introduced a number of chapters which are more or less of the
3073,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","nature of essays, and are often quite foreign to his theme. Moreover, he"
3074,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",dedicated several chapters to literary criticism of his father's works.
3075,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","It is, in fact, obvious to any one who examines the two volumes of 1883"
3076,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","which Robert Lytton contrived to fill, that he was careful to contribute"
3077,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",as little as he possibly could to the story which he had started out to
3078,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",relate. Although there is much that is interesting in the memoirs of
3079,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","1883, the reader is continually losing the thread of the narrative. The"
3080,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","reason is, no doubt, that Robert Lytton stood too close to his parents,"
3081,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","had seen too much of their disputes, was too much torn by the agonies of"
3082,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","his own stormy youth, and was too sensitively conscious of the scandal,"
3083,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","to tell the story at all. We have the impression that, in order to"
3084,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","forestall any other biography, he pretended himself to write a book"
3085,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",which he was subtle enough to make unintelligible.
3086,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3087,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","This baffling discretion, this feverish race from hiding-place to"
3088,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","hiding-place, has not only not been repeated by Lord Lytton in the new"
3089,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","_Life_, but the example of his father seems to have positively"
3090,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",emphasised his own determination to be straightforward and lucid. I know
3091,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",no modern biography in which the writer has kept more rigidly to the
3092,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","business of his narrative, or has less successfully been decoyed aside"
3093,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",by the sirens of family vanity. It must have been a great difficulty to
3094,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","the biographer to find his pathway cumbered by the volumes of 1883, set"
3095,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",by his father as a plausible man-trap for future intruders. Lord
3096,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Lytton, however, is the one person who is not an intruder, and he was"
3097,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",the only possessor of the key which his father had so diplomatically
3098,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","hidden. His task, however, was further complicated by the circumstance"
3099,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","that Bulwer-Lytton himself left in MS. an autobiography, dealing very"
3100,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",fully with his own career and character up to the age of twenty-two. The
3101,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",redundancy of all the Lyttons is amazing. Bulwer-Lytton would not have
3102,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",been himself if he had not overflowed into reflections which swelled his
3103,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",valuable account of his childhood into monstrous proportions. Lord
3104,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Lytton, who has a pretty humour, tells an anecdote which will be read"
3105,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",with pleasure:--
3106,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3107,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","""An old woman, who had once been one of Bulwer-Lytton's trusted"
3108,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","domestic servants, is still living in a cottage at Knebworth. One"
3109,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","day she was talking to me about my grandfather, and inadvertently"
3110,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",used an expression which summed him up more perfectly than any
3111,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",elaborate description could have done. She was describing his house
3112,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","at Copped Hall, where she had been employed as caretaker, and"
3113,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","added: 'In one of his attacks of _fluency_, I nursed him there for"
3114,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","many weeks.' 'Pleurisy,' I believe, was what she meant."""
3115,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3116,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","The bacillus of ""_fluency_"" interpenetrates the Autobiography, the"
3117,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","letters, the documents of every kind, and at any moment this disease"
3118,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",will darken Bulwer-Lytton's brightest hours. But curtailed by his
3119,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","grandson, and with its floral and heraldic ornaments well pared away,"
3120,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",the Autobiography is a document of considerable value. It is written
3121,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","with deliberate candour, and recalls the manner of Cobbett, a writer"
3122,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",with whom we should not expect to find Bulwer-Lytton in sympathy. It is
3123,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",probable that the author of it never saw himself nor those who
3124,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",surrounded him in precisely their true relation. There was something
3125,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","radically twisted in his image of life, which always seems to have"
3126,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",passed through a refracting surface on its way to his vision. No doubt
3127,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",this is more or less true of all experience; no power has given us the
3128,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","gift ""to see ourselves as others see us."" But in the case of"
3129,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Bulwer-Lytton this refractive habit of his imagination produced a
3130,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",greater swerving aside from positive truth than is usual. The result is
3131,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","that an air of the fabulous, of the incredible, is given to his"
3132,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","narratives, and often most unfairly."
3133,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3134,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","A close examination, in fact, of the Autobiography results in confirming"
3135,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","the historic truth of it. What is surprising is not, when we come to"
3136,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","consider them, the incidents themselves, but Bulwer-Lytton's odd way of"
3137,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","narrating them. Lord Lytton, without any comment, provides us with"
3138,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",curious material for the verification of his grandfather's narrative. He
3139,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","prints, here and there, letters from entirely prosaic persons which"
3140,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","tally, often to a surprising degree, with the extravagant statements of"
3141,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Bulwer-Lytton. To quote a single instance, of a very remarkable"
3142,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","character, Bulwer-Lytton describes the effect his scholarship produced,"
3143,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","at the age of seventeen, upon sober, elderly people, who were dazzled"
3144,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",with his accomplishments and regarded him as a youthful prodigy. It is
3145,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","the sort of confession, rather full-blooded and lyrical, which we might"
3146,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",easily set down to that phenomenon of refraction. But Lord Lytton prints
3147,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","a letter from Dr. Samuel Parr (whom, by the way, he calls ""a man of"
3148,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","sixty-four,"" but Parr, born in 1747, was seventy-four in 1821), which"
3149,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",confirms the autobiographer's account in every particular. The aged Whig
3150,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","churchman, who boasted a wider knowledge of Greek literature than any"
3151,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","other scholar of his day, and whose peremptory temper was matter of"
3152,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","legend, could write to this Tory boy a long letter of enthusiastic"
3153,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","criticism, and while assuring Bulwer-Lytton that he kept ""all the"
3154,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","letters with which you have honoured me,"" could add: ""I am proud of"
3155,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","such a correspondent; and, if we lived nearer to each other, I should"
3156,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","expect to be very happy indeed in such a friend."" Letters of this kind,"
3157,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","judiciously printed by Lord Lytton in his notes, serve to call us back"
3158,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",from the nebulous witchcraft in which Bulwer-Lytton was so fond of
3159,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","wrapping up the truth, and to remind us that, in spite of the"
3160,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","necromancer, the truth is there."
3161,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3162,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","From the point where the fragment of autobiography closes, although for"
3163,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",some time much the same material is used and some of the same letters
3164,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","are quoted, as were quoted and used by Robert Lytton, the presentation"
3165,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",of these is so different that the whole effect is practically one of
3166,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","novelty. But with the year 1826, when Edward Bulwer-Lytton, at the age"
3167,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","of three-and-twenty, became engaged to Rosina Doyle Wheeler, all is"
3168,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","positively new. The story of the marriage, separation, and subsequent"
3169,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",relations has never before been presented to the world with any approach
3170,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",to accuracy or fulness. No biographical notices of Bulwer-Lytton even
3171,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","touch on this subject, which has been hitherto abandoned to the gossip"
3172,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",of irresponsible contemporaries. It is true that a Miss Devey composed a
3173,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","""Life of Rosina, Lady Lytton,"" in which the tale was told. This work was"
3174,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","immediately suppressed, and is inaccessible to the public; but the only"
3175,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",person who is known to be familiar with its contents reports that it
3176,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","""contains fragments of the narrative, obviously biassed, wholly"
3177,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","inaccurate, and evidently misleading."" So far as the general public is"
3178,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","concerned, Lord Lytton's impartial history of the relations between his"
3179,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",grandfather and his grandmother is doubtless that portion of his book
3180,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","which will be regarded as the most important. I may, therefore, dwell"
3181,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",briefly upon his treatment of it.
3182,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3183,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","The biographer, in dealing with a subject of this incalculable"
3184,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","difficulty, could but lay himself open to the censure of those who"
3185,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",dislike the revelation of the truth on any disagreeable subject. This
3186,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","lion, however, stood in the middle of his path, and he had either to"
3187,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",wrestle with it or to turn back. Lord Lytton says in his preface that it
3188,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",was necessary to tell all or nothing of the matrimonial adventures of
3189,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","his grandparents, but, in reality, this was not quite the alternative,"
3190,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",which was to tell the truth or to withdraw from the task of writing a
3191,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Life of Bulwer-Lytton. The marriage and its results were so predominant
3192,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","in the career of the man, and poisoned it so deeply to the latest hour"
3193,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","of his consciousness, that to attempt a biography of him without clear"
3194,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",reference to them would have been like telling the story of Nessus the
3195,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Centaur without mentioning the poisoned arrow of Heracles. But Lord
3196,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Lytton shall give his own apology:--
3197,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3198,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","""As it was impossible to give a true picture of my grandfather"
3199,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","without referring to events which overshadowed his whole life, and"
3200,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","which were already partially known to the public, I decided to tell"
3201,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","the whole story as fully and as accurately as possible, in the firm"
3202,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",belief that the truth can damage neither the dead nor the living.
3203,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",The steps which led to the final separation between my
3204,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","grandparents, and the forces which brought about so disastrous a"
3205,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","conclusion of a marriage of love, apart from their biographical"
3206,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","interest, afford a study of human nature of the utmost value; and"
3207,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","so great are the moral lessons which this story contains, that I"
3208,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",venture to hope that the public may find in much that is tragic and
3209,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","pitiful much also that is redeeming, and that the ultimate verdict"
3210,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",of posterity may be that these two unfortunate people did not
3211,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","suffer entirely in vain."""
3212,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3213,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","His story, therefore, is not written with any partiality, and it seems"
3214,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",to be as full and as truthful as the ample materials at the author's
3215,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",disposal permitted. The reader will conjecture that Lord Lytton could
3216,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","have given many more details, but apart from the fact that they would"
3217,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","often have been wholly unfit for publication, it is difficult to see"
3218,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","that they would in any degree have altered the balance of the story, or"
3219,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","modified our judgment, which is quite sufficiently enlightened by the"

3223,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","forte, parce qu'elle attaque, à la fois, la tête, le coeur, le corps."""
3224,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",It is a commonplace to say that Edward Bulwer's whole career might have
3225,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","been altered if he had never met Rosina Wheeler, because this is true in"
3226,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",measure of every strong juvenile attachment: but it is rarely indeed so
3227,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",copiously or so fatally true as it was in his case. His existence was
3228,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","overwhelmed by this event; it was turned topsy-turvey, and it never"
3229,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",regained its equilibrium. In this adventure all was exaggerated; there
3230,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","was excess of desire, excess of gratification, an intense weariness, a"
3231,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",consuming hatred.

3233,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","On the first evening when the lovers met, in April 1826, an observer,"
3234,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","watching them as they talked, reflected that Bulwer's ""bearing had that"
3235,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","aristocratic something bordering on _hauteur_"" which reminded the"
3236,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","onlooker ""of the passage, 'Stand back; I am holier than thou!'"" The same"
3237,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","observer, dazzled, like the rest of the world, by the loveliness of Miss"

3239,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",beautiful caged wild creature of the woods--at a safe and secure
3240,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","distance."" It would have preserved a chance of happiness for"
3241,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Bulwer-Lytton to possess something of this stranger's clairvoyance. It
3242,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","was not strange perhaps, but unfortunate, that he did not notice--or"
3243,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","rather that he was not repelled by, for he did notice--the absence of"
3244,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","moral delicacy in the beautiful creature, the radiant and seductive"
3245,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Lamia, who responded so instantly to his emotion. He, the most"
3246,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","fastidious of men, was not offended by the vivacity of a young lady who"
3247,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",called attention to the vulgarity of her father's worsted stockings and
3248,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","had none but words of abuse for her mother. These things, indeed,"
3249,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","disconcerted the young aristocrat, but he put them down to a lack of"
3250,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",training; he persuaded himself that these were superficial blemishes and
3251,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",could be remedied; and he resigned his senses to the intoxication of
3252,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Rosina's beauty.
3253,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3254,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",At first--and indeed to the last--she stimulated his energy and his
3255,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",intellect. His love and his hatred alike spurred him to action. In
3256,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","August 1826, in spite of the violent opposition of his mother, he and"
3257,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Rosina were betrothed. By October Mrs. Bulwer had so far prevailed that
3258,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","the engagement was broken off, and Edward tossed in a whirlpool of"
3259,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","anger, love, and despair. It took the form of such an attack of"
3260,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","""fluency"" as was never seen before or after. Up to that time he had been"
3261,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",an elegant although feverish idler. Now he plunged into a strenuous life
3262,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",of public and private engagements. He prepared to enter the House of
3263,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Commons; he finished _Falkland_, his first novel; he started the"
3264,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","composition of _Pelham_ and of another ""light prose work,"" which may"
3265,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","have disappeared; he achieved a long narrative in verse, _O'Neill, or"
3266,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",the Rebel_; and he involved himself in literary projects without bound
3267,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",and without end. The aim of all this energy was money. It is true that
3268,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",he had broken off his betrothal; but it was at first only a pretence at
3269,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","estrangement, to hoodwink his mother. He was convinced that he could not"
3270,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","live without possessing Rosina, and as his mother held the strings of"
3271,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","the common purse, he would earn his own income and support a wife."
3272,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3273,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Mrs. Bulwer-Lytton, who had a Roman firmness, was absolutely determined"
3274,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","that her son should not marry ""a penniless girl whose education had been"
3275,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","so flagrantly neglected, who was vain and flighty, with a mocking humour"
3276,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","and a conspicuous lack of principle."" At this point the story becomes"
3277,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",exceedingly interesting. A Balzac would strip it of its romantic
3278,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","trappings, and would penetrate into its physiology. Out of Rosina's"
3279,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","sight, and diverted by the excess of his literary labours, Edward's"
3280,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","infatuation began to decline. His mother, whose power of character would"
3281,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",have been really formidable if it had been enforced by sympathy or even
3282,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","by tact, relaxed her opposition; and instantly her son, himself, no"
3283,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","longer attacked, became calmer and more clear-sighted. Rosina's faults"
3284,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",were patent to his memory; the magic of her beauty less invincible.
3285,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Within a month all was changed again. Rosina fretted herself into what
3286,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",she contrived to have reported to Bulwer-Lytton as an illness. She
3287,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","begged for an interview, and he went with reluctance to bid her farewell"
3288,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",for ever. It was Bulwer-Lytton's habit to take with him a masterpiece of
3289,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",literature upon every journey. It seems unfortunate that on this
3290,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","occasion _The Tempest_ was not his companion, for it might have warned"
3291,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","him, as Prospero warned Ferdinand, against the fever in the blood:--"

3296,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","The union of your bed, with weeds so loathly"
3297,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","That you shall hate it, both."""
3298,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3299,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","When his short interview, which was to have been a final one, was over,"
3300,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","that had happened which made a speedy marriage necessary, whatever the"

3302,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3303,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","The new conditions were clearly stated to old Mrs. Bulwer-Lytton, but"
3304,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","that formidable lady belonged to an earlier generation, and saw no"
3305,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",reason for Quixotic behaviour. Her conscience had been trained in the
3306,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","eighteenth century, and all her blame was for Rosina Wheeler. Torn"
3307,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","between his duty and his filial affection, Bulwer-Lytton now passed"
3308,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","through a period of moral agony. He wrote to his mother: ""I am far too"

3312,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Wheeler, not unnaturally stung to anger, used disrespectful expressions"
3313,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","regarding Mrs. Bulwer-Lytton, and these bickerings filled the lover and"
3314,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","son with indignation. His life, between these ladies, grew to be hardly"
3315,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","worth living, and in the midst of one such crisis this brilliant young"
3316,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","dandy of four-and-twenty wrote:--""I feel more broken-hearted,"
3317,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","despondent, and sated than any old valetudinarian who has seen all his"
3318,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","old hopes and friends drop off one by one, and finds himself left for"
3319,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","the rest of his existence to the solitary possession of gloom and gout."""
3320,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Mrs. Bulwer-Lytton fought fiercely to the last, and Edward determined to"
3321,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","close the matter; on August 29th, 1827, he married Rosina."
3322,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3323,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","At first, in spite of, and even because of, the wild hostility of his"
3324,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","mother, the marriage seemed successful. The rage of the mother drove the"
3325,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",husband to the wife. Lord Lytton has noted that in later years all that
3326,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",his grandfather and his grandmother said about one another was
3327,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",unconsciously biassed by their memory of later complications. Neither
3328,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Bulwer-Lytton nor Rosina could give an accurate history of their
3329,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","relations at the beginning, because the mind of each was prejudiced by"
3330,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",their knowledge of the end. Each sought to justify the hatred which both
3331,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","had lived to feel, by representing the other as hateful from the first."
3332,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","But the letters survive, and the recollections of friends, to prove that"
3333,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",this was entirely untrue. It must be admitted that their union was never
3334,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","based upon esteem, but wholly upon passion, and that from the first they"
3335,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","lacked that coherency of relation, in moral respects, which was needed"
3336,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",to fix their affections. But those who have dimly heard how bitterly
3337,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",these two unfortunate people hated one another in later life will be
3338,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",astonished to learn that they spent the two first years together like
3339,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",infatuated turtle-doves.
3340,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3341,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Their existence was romantic and absurd. Cut off from all support by the
3342,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","implacable anger of old Mrs. Bulwer-Lytton, they depended on a combined"
3343,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",income of £380 a year and whatever the husband could make to increase
3344,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","it. Accordingly they took a huge country house, Woodcot in Oxon, and"
3345,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",lived at the rate of several thousands a year. There they basked in an
3346,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",affluent splendour of bad taste which reminds us of nothing in the world
3347,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",so much as of those portions of _The Lady Flabella_ which Mrs.
3348,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Wititterly was presently to find so soft and so voluptuous. The
3349,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",following extract from one of Rosina's lively letters-and she was a very
3350,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","sprightly correspondent--gives an example of her style, of her husband's"
3351,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Pelhamish extravagance, and of the gaudy recklessness of their manner of"
3352,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",life. They had now been married nearly two years:--

3357,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",containing only eight Gros de Naples dresses of different colours

3380,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","to a jeweller here to have it weighed, and it weighed a pound all"

3389,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3390,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",It would be expected that all this crazy display would lead the young
3391,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",couple rapidly and deeply into debt. That it did not do so is the most
3392,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","curious phase of the story. Bulwer-Lytton immediately, and apparently"
3393,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","without the slightest difficulty, developed a literary industry the"
3394,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",sober record of which approaches the fabulous. Walter Scott alone may be
3395,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","held to have equalled it. The giants of popular fiction did, indeed,"
3396,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","enjoy larger single successes than Bulwer-Lytton did, but none of them,"
3397,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","not Dickens himself, was so uniformly successful. Everything he wrote"
3398,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",sold as though it were bread displayed to a hungry crowd. Even his
3399,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","poetry, so laboriously and lifelessly second-hand, always sold. He did"
3400,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",not know what failure was; he made money by _Devereux_; even _The New
3401,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Timon_ went into many editions. To earn what was required, however--and"
3402,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",in these early years he seems to have made £3000 his minimum of needful
3403,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","return--to live in the insane style which his wife and he demanded, an"
3404,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",enormous nervous strain was required. Edward Bulwer-Lytton's temper had
3405,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",always been warm and eager; it now grew irritable to the highest degree.
3406,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",His mother continued to exasperate him; his wife suddenly failed to
3407,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",please him; his health waned; and he became the most miserable of men;
3408,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",yet without ceasing for a moment to be the most indefatigable of
3409,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","authors. The reader will follow the evolution of the tragedy, which is"
3410,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","of poignant interest, in Lord Lytton's pages. The whole story is one of"
3411,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",the most extraordinary in the history of literature.
3412,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3413,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",It has been a feature of Bulwer-Lytton's curious posthumous fortune that
3414,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",he has seemed solitary in his intellectual if not in his political and
3415,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",social action. We think of him as one of those morose and lonely bees
3416,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","that are too busy gathering pollen to join the senate of the hive, and"
3417,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","are dwellers in the holes of the rocks. It is quite true that, with a"
3418,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","painful craving for affection, he had not the genius of friendship. The"
3419,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","general impression given by his biography is one of isolation; in ""the"

3422,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",temperament from those who surround it closely and to whom it stretches
3423,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",out its arms in vain. But a careful reading of these interesting volumes
3424,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","leaves us in no doubt of the cause of this loneliness. Bulwer-Lytton,"
3425,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","with all his ardour and his generosity, was devoid of the gift of"
3426,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",sympathy. In characters of a simpler mould a natural kindliness may take
3427,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",the place of comprehension. But Bulwer-Lytton had a lively and protean
3428,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",fancy which perpetually deceived him. In human relations he was always
3429,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","moving, but always on the wrong track."
3430,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3431,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","The letters to his mother, to his wife, to his son, exemplify this"
3432,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","unfortunate tendency. They are eloquent, they are even too eloquent, for"
3433,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Bulwer-Lytton intoxicated himself with his own verbosity; they are meant
3434,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","to be kind, they are meant to be just, they are meant to be wise and"
3435,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","dignified and tender; but we see, in Lord Lytton's impartial narrative,"
3436,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",that they scarcely ever failed to exasperate the receiver. His dealings
3437,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","with his son, of whom he was exquisitely proud and sensitively fond, are"
3438,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","of the saddest character, because of the father's want of comprehension,"
3439,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","haste of speech and intolerance of temper. The very fact that a son, a"
3440,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","wife, or a mother could with impunity be addressed in terms of"
3441,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","exaggerated sensibility, because there could be no appeal, was a snare"
3442,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","to the too-ready pen of Bulwer-Lytton, which, poured out its oceans of"
3443,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",ink without reflection and without apprehension. If violent offence were
3444,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","given, the post went out again later in the day, and equally violent"
3445,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",self-humiliation would restore the emotional balance. But what could not
3446,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",be restored was the sense of confidence and domestic security.
3447,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3448,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",In his contact with other literary men of his own age more restraint was
3449,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","necessary, and we learn from Lord Lytton's pages of valuable and"
3450,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",prolonged acquaintanceships which were sometimes almost friendships. His
3451,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","company was much sought after, and occasionally by very odd persons."
3452,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Lord Lytton prints a series of most diverting letters from the notorious
3453,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Harriette Wilson, who, in spite of the terror into which her ""Memoirs"""
3454,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","had thrown society, desired to add the author of _Pelham_ to the aviary"
3455,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",of her conquests. But the snare was set in vain before the eyes of so
3456,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","shrewd a bird as Bulwer-Lytton; he declined to see the lady, but he kept"
3457,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","her amazing letters. This was in 1829, when the novelist seems to have"
3458,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","had no literary or political associates. But by 1831, we find him"
3459,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","editing the _New Monthly Magazine_, and attaching himself to Lord"
3460,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Melbourne and Lord Durham on the one hand and to Disraeli and Dickens on
3461,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",the other. When to these we have added Lady Blessington and Letitia
3462,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Landon, we have mentioned all those public persons with whom"
3463,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Bulwer-Lytton seems to have been on terms of intimacy during his early
3464,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",manhood. All through these years he was an incessant diner-out and
3465,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","party-goer, and the object of marvellous adulation, but he passed"
3466,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",through all this social parade as though it had been a necessary portion
3467,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",of the exterior etiquette of life. Why he fatigued himself by these
3468,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","formal exercises, in which he seems to have found no pleasure, it is"
3469,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","impossible to conceive, but a sense of the necessity of parade was"
3470,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",strangely native to him.
3471,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3472,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","He had, however, one close and constant friend. John Forster was by far"
3473,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",the most intimate of all his associates throughout his career.
3474,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Bulwer-Lytton seems to have met him first about 1834, when he was"
3475,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",twenty-eight and Forster only twenty-two. In spite of this disparity in
3476,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","age, the younger man almost at once took a tone of authority such as the"
3477,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",elder seldom permitted in an acquaintance. Forster had all the gifts
3478,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","which make a friend valuable. He was rich in sympathy and resource, his"
3479,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","temper was reasonable, he comprehended a situation, he knew how to hold"
3480,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",his own in argument and yet yield with grace. Lord Lytton prints a very
3481,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","interesting character-sketch of Forster, which he has found among his"
3482,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",grandfather's MSS. It is a tribute which does equal credit to him who
3483,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",makes it and to him of whom it is made:--
3484,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3485,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","""John Forster.... A most sterling man, with an intellect at once"
3486,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","massive and delicate. Few, indeed, have his strong practical sense"
3487,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",and sound judgment; fewer still unite with such qualities his
3488,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","exquisite appreciation of latent beauties in literary art. Hence,"
3489,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","in ordinary life, there is no safer adviser about literary work,"
3490,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",especially poetry; no more refined critic. A large heart naturally
3491,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",accompanies so masculine an understanding. He has the rare capacity
3492,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",for affection which embraces many friendships without loss of depth
3493,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",or warmth in one. Most of my literary contemporaries are his
3494,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","intimate companions, and their jealousies of each other do not"
3495,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","diminish their trust in him. More than any living critic, he has"
3496,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",served to establish reputations. Tennyson and Browning owed him
3497,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","much in their literary career. Me, I think, he served in that way"
3498,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","less than any of his other friends. But, indeed, I know of no"
3499,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",critic to whom I have been much indebted for any position I hold in
3500,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",literature. In more private matters I am greatly indebted to his
3501,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",counsels. His reading is extensive. What faults he has lie on the
3502,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",surface. He is sometimes bluff to rudeness. But all such faults of
3503,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",manner (and they are his only ones) are but trifling inequalities
3504,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","in a nature solid and valuable as a block of gold."""
3505,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3506,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","This was written with full experience, as the names of Tennyson and"
3507,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Browning will remind us, for Bulwer-Lytton was slow to admit the value"
3508,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",of these younger talents. His relations with Tennyson have always been
3509,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",known to be unfortunate; as they are revealed in Lord Lytton's biography
3510,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",they approach the incredible. He met Browning at Covent Garden Theatre
3511,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","during the Macready ""revival"" of the poetic stage, but it was not until"
3512,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",after the publication of _Men and Women_ that he became conscious of
3513,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Browning's claim, which he then very grudgingly admitted. He was"
3514,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","grateful to Browning for his kindness to Robert Lytton in Italy, but he"
3515,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",never understood his genius or his character.
3516,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3517,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","What, however, we read with no less pleasure than surprise are the"
3518,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",evidences of Bulwer-Lytton's interest in certain authors of a later
3519,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","generation, of whom the general public has never suspected him to have"
3520,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",been aware. Something almost like friendship sprang up as lately as 1867
3521,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","between him and a man whom nobody would suppose him to admire, Matthew"
3522,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Arnold. It sometimes happens that a sensitive and petulant artist finds
3523,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",it more easy to acknowledge the merits of his successors than to endure
3524,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",those of his immediate contemporaries. The _Essays in Criticism_ and
3525,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",_The Study of Celtic Literature_ called forth from the author of _My
3526,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Novel_ and _The Caxtons_ such eulogy as had never been spared for the
3527,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",writings of Thackeray or Carlyle. Matthew Arnold appeared to
3528,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Bulwer-Lytton to have ""brought together all that is most modern in"
3529,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","sentiment, with all that is most scholastic in thought and language."""
3530,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Arnold was a guest at Knebworth, and brought the Duke of Genoa with him."
3531,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","He liked Bulwer-Lytton, and their relations became very cordial and"
3532,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","lasted for some years; Arnold has given an amusing, but very"
3533,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","sympathetic, account of the dignified hospitalities of Knebworth."
3534,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3535,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","No revelation in Lord Lytton's volumes is, however, more pleasing or"
3536,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",more unexpected than his grandfather's correspondence with Swinburne. It
3537,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","is thought that he heard of him through Monckton Milnes; at all events,"
3538,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","he was an early reader of _Atalanta in Calydon_. When, in 1866, all the"
3539,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","furies of the Press fell shrieking on _Poems and Ballads_, Bulwer-Lytton"
3540,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","took a very generous step. He wrote to Swinburne, expressing his"
3541,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",sympathy and begging him to be calm. The young poet was extremely
3542,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","touched, and took occasion to beg the elder writer for his advice, the"
3543,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","publisher having, without consulting him, withdrawn his volume from"
3544,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",sale. Bulwer-Lytton's reply was a most cordial invitation to stay with
3545,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",him at Knebworth and talk the matter over. Swinburne gratefully
3546,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","accepted, and John Forster was asked to meet him. It was Bulwer-Lytton,"
3547,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","it appears, who found another publisher for the outraged volume, and"
3548,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",helped Swinburne out of the scrape. He was always kindness itself if an
3549,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","appeal was made to his protection, and to his sense of justice. However,"
3550,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","pleasant as the visit to Knebworth was, there is no evidence that it was"
3551,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","repeated. Bulwer-Lytton considered Swinburne's opinions preposterous,"
3552,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","and indeed if he told Swinburne, as in 1869 he told his son Robert, that"
3553,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Victor Hugo was ""but an epileptic dwarf in a state of galvanism,"" there"
3554,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",must have been wigs on the green at Knebworth.
3555,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3556,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","The student of the biography, if he is already familiar with the more"
3557,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","characteristic works of Bulwer-Lytton, will find himself for the first"
3558,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",time provided with a key to much that has puzzled him in the nature of
3559,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","that author. The story itself, apart from the tragic matrimonial trouble"
3560,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","which runs through it like a blood-red cord, is of unusual interest. It"
3561,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","is a story of strife, without repose, without enjoyment, but with a good"
3562,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",deal of splendour and satisfaction. Almost to the end Bulwer-Lytton was
3563,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",engaged in struggle. As an ambitious social being he was fighting the
3564,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",world; as an author he was battling with his critics; as a statesman he
3565,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",was always in the wild storm of party politics. As a private individual
3566,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",he was all the time keeping his head up against the tide of social
3567,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","scandal which attacked him when he least expected it, and often"
3568,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",threatened to drown him altogether. This turmoil contrasts with the calm
3569,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","of the evening years, after the peerage had been won, the ambition"
3570,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","satisfied, the literary reputation secured."
3571,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3572,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Few writers have encountered, in their own time and after their death,"
3573,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","so much adverse criticism, and yet have partly survived it. It is hardly"
3574,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","realised, even perhaps by Lord Lytton, how unwilling the reviewers were"
3575,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","to give credit to his grandfather. He never found favour in their eyes,"
3576,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","and it was a matter of constant resentment with him that they did him,"
3577,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","as he thought, injustice. The evidence of his wounded feelings is"
3578,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",constant in his letters. The Quarterly Review never mentioned him
3579,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","without contempt until 1865, when the publication of his works, in"
3580,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","forty-three volumes, forced it to consider this indefatigable and"
3581,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","popular writer with a measure of respect. Sir Walter Scott, with his"
3582,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","universal geniality, read _Pelham_ in 1828 and ""found it very"
3583,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","interesting: the light is easy and gentlemanlike, the dark very grand"
3584,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","and sombrous."" He asked who was the author, and he tried to interest his"
3585,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","son-in-law in the novel. But Lockhart was implacable: ""_Pelham_,"" he"
3586,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","replied, ""is writ by a Mr. Bulwer, a Norfolk squire, and horrid puppy. I"
3587,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","have not read the book, from disliking the author."" Lockhart, however,"
3588,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","did read _Devereux_, and three years afterwards, when reviewing some"
3589,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","other novel, he said of the historical characters in that romance: ""It"
3590,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",seems hard to disquiet so many bright spirits for the sole purpose of
3591,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","showing that they _could_ be dull."" That was the attitude of the higher"
3592,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","criticism to Bulwer-Lytton from, let us say, 1830 to 1860; he was ""a"
3593,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","horrid puppy"" and he was also ""dull."""
3594,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3595,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",But this was far from being the opinion of the reading public. We have
3596,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","seen that he never failed, and sometimes he soared into the very"
3597,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","empyrean of popularity. In 1834, when he published _The Last Days of"
3598,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Pompeii_, again in 1837 when he published _Ernest Maltravers_, the"
3599,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",ecstasy of his adorers discovered their favourite in a moment under the
3600,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",mask of anonymity which he chose to assume. This was just before the
3601,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",outburst of the great school of Victorian novelists; Bulwer had as yet
3602,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","practically no one but Disraeli to compete with. These two, the author"
3603,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","of _Pelham_ and the author of _Vivian Grey_, raced neck and neck at the"
3604,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","head of the vast horde of ""fashionable"" novel-writers; now all but them"
3605,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",forgotten. In Bulwer-Lytton's romances the reader moved among exalted
3606,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","personages, alternately flippant and sinister; a ""mournful enthusiasm"""
3607,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",was claimed for the writer by the readers of his day. It was the latest
3608,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",and most powerful development of that Byronic spirit which had been so
3609,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","shortlived in verse, but which was to survive in prose until"
3610,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",Bulwer-Lytton adopted his _Caxtons_ manner in the middle of the century.
3611,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","As always in Byronic periods, the portrait of the author himself was"
3612,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",searched for among his most fatal conceptions. To the young library
3613,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","subscriber the stoical, solitary figure of Mordaunt, in _The Disowned_,"
3614,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",was exactly what was wanted as a representation of the mysterious
3615,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","novelist himself. Pelham was the apotheosis of the man of fashion, and"
3616,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","it is amusing to read how, when the Bulwer-Lyttons travelled, they were"
3617,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",gazed at in reverence as the Pelham and the Pelhamess.
3618,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3619,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",It would be difficult to improve upon the language used so early as 1832
3620,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",by one of the very few critics who attempted to do justice to
3621,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Bulwer-Lytton's merits. The _Edinburgh Review_ found in him ""a style"
3622,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","vigorous and pliable, sometimes strangely incorrect, but often rising"
3623,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","into a touching eloquence."" Ten years later such was the private opinion"
3624,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","of D.G. Rossetti, who was ""inspired by reading _Rienzi_ and _Ernest"
3625,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Maltravers_, which is indeed a splendid work."" Now that we look back at"
3626,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Bulwer-Lytton's prodigious compositions, we are able to perceive more"
3627,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",justly than did the critics of his own day what his merits were. For one
3628,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","thing, he was extraordinarily versatile. If we examine his books, we"
3629,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",must be astonished at their variety. He painted the social life of his
3630,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","own day, he dived into spectral romance, he revived the beautiful"
3631,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","ceremonies of antiquity, he evoked the great shades of English and of"
3632,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Continental history, he made realistic and humorous studies of"
3633,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","middle-class life, he engaged in vehement controversy on topics of the"
3634,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","hour, he prophesied of the order of the future, he wrote comedies and"
3635,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","tragedies, epics and epistles, satires and lyrics. His canvasses were"
3636,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",myriad and he crowded every one of them with figures. At his most
3637,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","Byronic moment he flung his dark cloak aside, and danced in motley"
3638,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","through _Paul Clifford_, with its outrageous caricature of George IV."
3639,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",and his Ministers as a gang of Hounslow highwaymen. Perhaps his best
3640,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","claim to regard is the insatiability of his human curiosity, evinced in"
3641,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",the almost infinite variety of his compositions.
3642,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",
3643,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",The singular being who wrote so large a library of works and whose
3644,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","actual features have so carefully been concealed from the public, will"
3645,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""",be known at last. The piety of his grandson has presented him to us with
3646,"THE AUTHOR OF ""PELHAM""","no reservations and no false lights. Here he stands, this half-fabulous"

3666,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],invocation of the genius of the place. We meet at Dewsbury because the

3668,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],imperative that for whatever picture of them I may endeavour to present

3670,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Unfortunately, however, although in the hands of a skilful painter the"
3671,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"figures of the ladies may glow forth, I fear that in the matter of"
3672,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],taking Dewsbury as the background some vagueness and some darkness are
3673,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],inevitable. In the biographies of Mrs. Gaskell and of Mr. Clement
3674,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Shorter, as well as in the proceedings of your society, I have searched"
3675,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],for evidences of the place Dewsbury took in the lives of the Brontës.
3676,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],What I find--I expect you to tell me that it is not exhaustive--is this.
3677,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Their father, the Rev. Patrick Brontë, was curate here from 1809 to"
3678,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"1811. In 1836, when Charlotte was twenty, Miss Wooler transferred her"
3679,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],school from Roe Head to Heald's House at the top of Dewsbury Moor. In
3680,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"this school, where Charlotte had been a pupil since 1831, she was now a"
3681,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"governess, and a governess she remained until early in 1838. In April of"
3682,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],that year Miss Wooler was taken ill and Charlotte was for a little while
3683,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"in charge. Then there was an explosion of temper, of some kind, and"
3684,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],Charlotte went back to Haworth.
3685,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],
3686,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"That, then, in the main, is the limit of what the scrupulous Muse of"
3687,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],history vouchsafes to tell us about Charlotte Brontë's relation to
3688,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],Dewsbury. But it also supplies us with one or two phrases which I cannot
3689,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"bring myself to spare you. In January 1838, Charlotte reviews her"
3690,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"experience at Dewsbury Moor; ""I feel,"" she says, ""in nothing better,"
3691,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"nothing humbler nor purer."" Again, in 1841, after there had passed time"
3692,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"enough to mellow her exacerbations, she continues to express herself"
3693,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],with vigour. Miss Wooler is making overtures to Charlotte and Emily to
3694,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],take over the school at Heald's House; perhaps a place might be found
3695,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"for Anne as well. Miss Wooler, one of the kindest of women, is most"
3696,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"thoughtful, most conciliatory. Charlotte will have none of the idea; she"
3697,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],puts it roughly from her. Of Dewsbury she has nothing to say but that
3698,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"""it is a poisoned place for me."" This is all we know of Charlotte's"
3699,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"relation to Dewsbury, yet nothing, you will tell me, in Froude's phrase,"
3700,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"to what the angels know. Well, I must be frank with you and say that I"
3701,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],am afraid the angels have been inclined to record exceedingly little of
3702,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],Charlotte Brontë's residence in your inoffensive neighbourhood. I have
3703,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"to paint a background to my picture, and I find none but the gloomiest"
3704,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],colours. They have to be what the art-critics of the eighteenth century
3705,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"called ""sub-fusc."" But it is not the fault of Dewsbury, it is the fault,"
3706,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"or the misfortune, of our remarkable little genius. She was here, in"
3707,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"this wholesome and hospitable vicinity, for several months, during which"
3708,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"time ""she felt in nothing better, neither humbler nor purer,"" and"
3709,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"looking back upon it, she had to admit that it was ""a poisoned place"""
3710,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],to her.
3711,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],
3712,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"I cannot help fancying that you will agree with me, that on such an"
3713,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"occasion as the present, and especially when dealing with a group of"
3714,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"writers about whom so much as has been said as about the Brontës, it is"
3715,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"wise not to cover too wide a ground, but to take, and keep to, one"
3716,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],aspect of the subject. Our little excursion into the history seems to
3717,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"have given us, under the heading ""Dewsbury,"" a rather grim text, from"
3718,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"which, nevertheless, we may perhaps extract some final consolation. Let"
3719,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"me say at the outset that for the grimness, for the harshness, Dewsbury"
3720,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"is not at all to blame. I fancy that if, in the years from 1836 to 1838,"
3721,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"the Brontë girls had been visitors to Kubla Khan, and had been fed on"
3722,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"honey by his myrmidons at Xanadu, that pleasure-dome would yet have been"
3723,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"""poisoned"" to them. It was not poverty, and cold, and the disagreeable"
3724,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"position of a governess, it was not the rough landscape of your moors,"
3725,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],nor its lack of southern amenity which made Charlotte wretched here. It
3726,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"was not in good Miss Wooler, nor in the pupils, nor in the visitors at"
3727,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Heald's House that the mischief lay, it was in the closed and patient"
3728,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"crater of Charlotte's own bosom. And I am almost persuaded that, if you"
3729,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"had lived in Dewsbury sixty-five years ago, you would have heard on very"
3730,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],quiet days a faint subterranean sound which you would never have been
3731,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"able to guess was really the passion, furiously panting, shut up in the"

3735,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"I do not see how it could be otherwise, and do scarcely wish that it"
3736,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],could have been. Let us not be too sentimental in this matter. Figures
3737,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],in literature are notable and valuable to us for what they give us. The
3738,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"more personal and intense and definite that is, the greater the gift,"

3741,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],give; what that was we shall presently try to note. But whatever we find
3742,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"it to be, we start with allowing that it was extremely and boldly"
3743,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],original. It was not to be mastered by lying upon padded sofas and

3746,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],they designed to wring from nature and from life were not likely to be
3747,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],revealed to the self-indulgent and the dilettante. The sisters had a
3748,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],message from the sphere of indignation and revolt. In order that they
3749,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"should learn it as well as teach it, it was necessary that they should"
3750,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],arrive on the scene at an evil hour for their own happiness. _Jane Eyre_
3751,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"and _Shirley_ and _Villette_ could not have been written unless, for"
3752,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"long years, the world had been ""a poisoned place"" for Charlotte Brontë."
3753,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],
3754,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"It has been excellently said by Mrs. Humphry Ward that in many respects,"
3755,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"and to the very last, the Brontës challenge no less than they attract"
3756,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"us. This is an aspect which, in the midst of rapturous modern"
3757,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"heroine-worship, we are apt to forget. Thackeray, who respected the"
3758,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"genius of the family, and was immensely kind to the author of _Jane"
3759,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Eyre_, never really felt comfortable in her company. We know how he"
3760,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"stole out of his own front-door, and slipped away into the night to"
3761,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"escape her. ""A very austere little person,"" he called her, and we may"
3762,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],put what emphasis on the austerity we will. I feel sure that any
3763,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"maladroit ""white-washing of Charlotte"" will tend, sooner or later,"
3764,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"good-natured though it may be, in a failure to comprehend what she"
3765,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"really was, in what her merit consisted, what the element in her was"
3766,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"that, for instance, calls us here together nearly half a century after"
3767,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],she completed her work and passed away. Young persons of genius very
3768,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"commonly write depressing books; since, the more vivid an unripe"
3769,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"creature's impression of life is, the more acute is its distress. It is"
3770,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"only extremely stupid Sunday-school children who shout in chorus, ""We"
3771,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"are so happy, happy, happy!"" Genius thrown naked, with exposed nerves,"
3772,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"on a hard indifferent world, is never ""happy"" at first. Earth is a"

3774,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],and discovered its food.
3775,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],
3776,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"But in the case of Charlotte Brontë, unhappiness was more than juvenile"
3777,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"fretfulness. All her career was a revolt against conventionality,"
3778,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"against isolation, against irresistible natural forces, such as climate"
3779,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],and ill-health and physical insignificance. Would this insubmissive
3780,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"spirit have passed out of her writings, as it passed, for instance, out"
3781,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"of those of George Sand? I am not sure, for we see it as strongly,"
3782,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"though more gracefully and skilfully expressed, in _Villette_ as in the"
3783,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],early letters which her biographers have printed. Her hatred of what was
3784,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],commonplace and narrow and obvious flung her against a wall of
3785,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"prejudice, which she could not break down. She could only point to it by"
3786,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],her exhausting efforts; she could only invite the generation which
3787,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"succeeded her to bring their pickaxes to bear upon it. Hence, to the"
3788,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"very last, she seems, more than any other figure in our literature, to"
3789,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"be forever ruffled in temper, for ever angry and wounded and indignant,"
3790,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"rejecting consolation, crouched like a sick animal in the cavern of her"
3791,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"own quenchless pride. This is not an amiable attitude, nor is it"
3792,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],historically true that this was Charlotte Brontë's constant aspect. But
3793,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"I will venture to say that her amiabilities, her yielding moods, are"
3794,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"really the unessential parts of her disposition, and that a certain"
3795,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],admirable ferocity is the notable feature of her intellectual character.
3796,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],
3797,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Her great heart was always bleeding. Here at Dewsbury, in the years we"
3798,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"are contemplating, the hemorrhage was of the most doleful kind, for it"
3799,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"was concealed, suppressed, it was an inward flow. When once she became"
3800,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"an author the pain of her soul was relieved. She said, in 1850, looking"
3801,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"back on the publication of the hapless first volume of poems, ""The mere"
3802,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"effort to succeed gave a wonderful zest to existence."" Then, a little"
3803,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"later, when no one had paid the slightest attention to the slender trio"
3804,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"of maiden voices, ""Something like the chill of despair began to invade"
3805,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"their hearts."" With a less powerful inspiration, they must have ceased"
3806,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],to make the effort; they must have succumbed in a melancholy oblivion.
3807,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],But they were saved by the instinct of a mission. It was not their
3808,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],private grief which primarily stirred them. What urged them on was the
3809,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],dim consciousness that they gave voice to a dumb sense of the suffering
3810,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],of all the world. They had to go on working; they had to pursue their
3811,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"course, though it might seem sinister or fatal; their business was to"
3812,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"move mankind, not to indulge or please it. They ""must be honest; they"
3813,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"must not varnish, soften, or conceal."""
3814,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],
3815,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"What Charlotte Brontë was learning to do in her grim and, let us admit"
3816,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"it, her unlovely probation on Dewsbury Moor, was to introduce a fresh"
3817,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],aspect of the relations of literature to life. Every great writer has a
3818,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],new note; hers was--defiance. All the aspects in which life presented
3819,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"itself to her were distressing, not so much in themselves as in herself."
3820,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"She rebelled against the outrages of poverty, and she drank to its dregs"
3821,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"the cup of straitened circumstances. She was proud, as proud as Lucifer,"
3822,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],and she was forced into positions which suppleness and cheerfulness
3823,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"might have made tolerable, if not agreeable. She wrung from these"
3824,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],positions their last drop of bitterness. A very remarkable instance of
3825,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"this may be found in her relation to the Sidgwick family, who, by"
3826,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"universal report, were generous, genial, and unassuming. To Charlotte"
3827,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Brontë these kindly, if somewhat commonplace folk, grew to seem what a"
3828,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],Turkish pasha seems to the inhabitants of a Macedonian village. It was
3829,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"not merely the surroundings of her life--it was life itself, in its"
3830,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"general mundane arrangements, which was intolerable to her. She fretted"
3831,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"in it, she beat her wings against its bars, and she would have done the"
3832,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"same if those bars had been of gold, and if the fruits of paradise had"
3833,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"been pushed to her between them. This, I think, is why the expression of"
3834,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"her anger seems too often disproportionate, and why her irony is so apt"
3835,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],to be preposterous. She was born to resist being caged in any form. Her
3836,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"defiance was universal, and often it was almost indiscriminate."
3837,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],
3838,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],Do not let us presume to blame this insubmission. Still less let us
3839,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],commit the folly of minimising it. A good cheerful little Charlotte
3840,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Brontë, who thought the best of everybody, who gaily took her place"
3841,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"without a grudging sigh, whose first aim was to make those about her"
3842,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"happy and to minister to their illusions, would have been a much more"
3843,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],welcome inmate of Miss Wooler's household than the cantankerous
3844,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"governess whom nobody could please, whose susceptibilities were always"
3845,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"on edge, whose lonely arrogance made her feared by all but one or two"
3846,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],who timidly persisted in loving her. But such a paragon of the obvious
3847,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],virtues would have passed as the birds pass and as the flowers. She
3848,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],would have left no mark behind. She would never have enriched the
3849,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],literature of England by one of its master-evidences of the force of
3850,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],human will. She would never have stirred hundreds of thousands of
3851,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],consciences to a wholesome questioning of fate and their own souls.
3852,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],
3853,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],Let us endeavour to pursue the inquiry a few steps further. It is
3854,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],impossible to separate the ethical conditions of an author's mind from
3855,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],the work that he produces. The flower requires the soil; it betrays in
3856,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],its colour and its perfume the environment of its root. The moral
3857,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],constitution of the writer is reflected in the influence of the written
3858,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],page. This is the incessant contention; on one hand the independence of
3859,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"art asserts itself; on the other, it is impossible to escape from the"
3860,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],implicit influence of conduct upon art. There have been few writers of
3861,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],any age in whom this battle raged more fiercely than it did in Charlotte
3862,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Brontë. Her books, and those of her sisters, seem anodyne enough to-day;"
3863,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"to readers of a sensitive species they seemed, when they were published,"
3864,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"as dangerous as _Werther_ had been, as seductive as the _Nouvelle"
3865,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Heloïse_. The reason of this was, in the main, the spirit of revolt"
3866,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],which inspired them. There was something harsh and glaring in their
3867,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],landscape; there was that touch of Salvator Rosa which one of their
3868,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],earliest critics observed in them. But more essential was the
3869,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"stubbornness, the unflinching determination to revise all accepted"
3870,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"formulas of conduct, to do this or that, not because it was usual to do"
3871,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"it, but because it was rational, and in harmony with human nature."
3872,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],
3873,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Into an age which had become almost exclusively utilitarian, and in"
3874,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"which the exercise of the imagination, in its real forms, was sedulously"
3875,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"discountenanced, Charlotte Brontë introduced passion in the sphere of"
3876,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"prose fiction, as Byron had introduced it in the sphere of verse thirty"
3877,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"years earlier. It was an inestimable gift; it had to come to us, from"
3878,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Charlotte Brontë or another, to save our literature from a decline into"
3879,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"triviality and pretension. But she suffered, as Byron had suffered, in"
3880,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],the direct ratio of her originality. If a writer employs passion in an
3881,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],age which has ceased to recognise it as one of the necessities of
3882,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],literary vitality he is safe to be accused of perverting his readers.
3883,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"Balzac says, ""When nothing else can be charged against an author, the"
3884,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"reproach of immorality is thrown at his head."" When we study the record"
3885,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"of the grim life of the sisters at Haworth, like that of three young"
3886,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],soldiers round a camp-fire with the unseen enemy prowling in the
3887,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"darkness just out of their sight--when we think of the strenuous vigil,"
3888,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"the intractable and indomitable persistence, the splendour of the"
3889,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],artistic result--we may console ourselves in our anger at the insults
3890,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"they endured, by reflecting how little they cared. And their noble"
3891,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],indifference to opinion further endears them to us. We may repeat of
3892,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"them all what Charlotte in a letter once said of Emily, ""A certain"
3893,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],harshness in her powerful and peculiar character only makes me cling to
3894,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"her more."""
3895,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],
3896,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"This insubmissiveness, which was the unconscious armour given to protect"
3897,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"her against the inevitable attacks of fortune, while, on the other hand,"
3898,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"it was the very sign-manual of Charlotte's genius, was, on the other, a"
3899,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],drawback from which she did not live long enough to emancipate her
3900,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],nature. It is responsible for her lack of interest in what is delicate
3901,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],and complex; it excused to herself a narrowness of vision which we are
3902,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],sometimes tempted to find quite distressing. It is probably the cause of
3903,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"a fault that never quits her for long, a tendency to make her characters"
3904,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],express themselves with a lyrical extravagance which sometimes comes
3905,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],close to the confines of rodomontade. Charlotte Brontë never arrives at
3906,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],that mastery of her material which permits the writer to stand apart
3907,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"from his work, and sway the reader with successive tides of emotion"
3908,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],while remaining perfectly calm himself. Nor is she one of those whose
3909,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"visible emotion is nevertheless fugitive, like an odour, and evaporates,"
3910,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],leaving behind it works of art which betray no personal agitation. On
3911,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"the contrary, her revolt, her passion, all the violence of her"
3912,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"sensibility, are present on her written page, and we cannot read it with"
3913,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"serenity or with a merely captious curiosity, because her own eager"
3914,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"spirit, immortal in its active force, seems to throb beside it."
3915,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],
3916,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],The aspect of Charlotte Brontë which I have tried to indicate to you
3917,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"to-day, and which I have sketched thus hastily and slightly against the"
3918,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"background of her almost voiceless residence in Dewsbury, is far from"
3919,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],being a complete or unique one. I offer it to you only as a single facet
3920,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"of her wonderful temperament, of the rich spectacle of her talent. I"
3921,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"have ventured to propose it, because, in the multiplication of honours"
3922,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"and attentions, the tendency to deify the human, to remove those"
3923,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"phenomena of irregularity which are the evidence of mortal strength,"
3924,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"grows irresistible, and we find ourselves, unconsciously, substituting a"
3925,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"waxen bust, with azure eyes and golden hair, for the homely features"
3926,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],which (if we could but admit it) so infinitely better match the honest
3927,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],stories. Let us not busy ourselves to make excuse for our austere little
3928,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"genius of the moors. Let us be content to take her exactly as she was,"
3929,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"with her rebellion and her narrowness, her angers and her urgencies,"
3930,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],perceiving that she had to be this sorrowful offspring of a poisoned
3931,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],"world in order to clear the wells of feeling for others, and to win from"
3932,THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRONTËS[7],emancipated generations of free souls the gratitude which is due to a

3945,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,him with great success in a particular direction to obtain due credit
3946,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,for what he accomplishes with less manifest success in another. There is
3947,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"no doubt that Disraeli as an author has, at all events until very"
3948,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"lately, suffered from the splendour of his fame as a politician. But he"

3953,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"bought, and produced a wide sensation, but they were barely accepted as"
3954,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,contributions to literature. If we look back to the current criticism of
3955,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"those times, we find such a book as _Dacre_, a romance by the Countess"
3956,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"of Morley, which is now absolutely forgotten, treated with a dignity and"
3957,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,a consideration never accorded to _The Young Duke_ or to _Henrietta
3958,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"Temple_. Even Disraeli's satiric squibs, in the manner of Lucian and"
3959,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"Swift, which seem to us among the most durable ornaments of light"
3960,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"literature in the days of William IV., were read and were laughed at,"
3961,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,but were not critically appraised.
3962,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,
3963,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"So, too, at the middle period of Disraeli's literary life, such books as"
3964,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,_Coningsby_ and _Tancred_ were looked upon as amusing commentaries on
3965,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"the progress of a strenuous politician, not by any means, or by any"
3966,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"responsible person, as possible minor classics of our language. And at"
3967,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"his third period, the ruling criticism of the hour was aghast at faults"
3968,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"which now entertain us, and was blind to sterling merits which we are"
3969,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"now ready to acknowledge. Shortly after his death, perhaps his most"
3970,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,brilliant apologist was fain to admit that if Disraeli had been
3971,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"undistinguished as a speaker, his novels would have been ""as the flowers"
3972,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"of the field, charming for the day which was passing over them, and then"
3973,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"forgotten."" It is only since the beginning of the present century that a"
3974,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,conviction has been gaining ground that some of these books were in
3975,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"themselves durable, not because they were the work of a man who became"
3976,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"Prime Minister of England and made his sovereign Empress of India, but"
3977,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,as much or as little as if they had been composed by a recluse in a
3978,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,hermitage. This impression has now become so general with enlightened
3979,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,critics that the danger seems to be that we should underrate certain
3980,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,excesses of rhetoric and the Corinthian mode the errors of which used to
3981,THE NOVELS OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI,"be over-emphasised, but should not, in a comparative survey of Victorian"

3999,I,"with _Coningsby_ (1844) and ending with _Tancred_ (1847), during which"
4000,I,time he was working out his political destiny; and we have the novels
4001,I,which he wrote after he had won the highest distinction in the State.
4002,I,"Certain general characteristics are met with in all these three classes,"
4003,I,but they have also differences which require to be noted and accounted
4004,I,"for. It will, therefore, be convenient to treat them successively."
4005,I,
4006,I,As oblivion scatters its poppy over the prose fiction of the reigns of
4007,I,"George IV. and William IV., it becomes in creasingly dangerous that"
4008,I,"criticism should take the early ""fashionable"" novels of Disraeli as"
4009,I,solitary representations of literary satire or observation. It is true
4010,I,that to readers of to-day this class of romance is exclusively
4011,I,"suggestive of _Vivian Grey_ and its fellows, with perhaps the _Pelham_"
4012,I,of Bulwer. But this was not the impression of the original readers of
4013,I,"these novels, who were amused by them, but found nothing revolutionary"
4014,I,"in their treatment of society. In the course of _The Young Duke_,"
4015,I,"written in 1829, Disraeli suggests an amiable rivalry with the romances"
4016,I,"""written by my friends Mr. Ward and Mr. Bulwer."" The latter name had"
4017,I,"only just risen above the horizon, but that of Plumer Ward, forgotten as"
4018,I,"it now is, was one to conjure by. Ward was the author of _Tremaine_"
4019,I,"(1825) and _De Vere_ (1827), two novels of the life of a modern English"
4020,I,"gentleman, which seems to a reader to-day to be insipid and dull enough."
4021,I,"But they contained ""portraits"" of public persons, they undertook to hold"
4022,I,"the mirror up to the political and fashionable world of London, and they"
4023,I,lashed that fastidiousness which was considered to be the foible of the
4024,I,age.
4025,I,
4026,I,"The books of Plumer Ward, who was an accomplished personage in advancing"
4027,I,"years, were treated with marked distinction in the press, and were"
4028,I,welcomed by critics who deigned to take little notice of even such books
4029,I,as _Granby_ and _Dacre_. But the stories of the youthful Disraeli
4030,I,belonged to a class held in still less esteem than those just mentioned.
4031,I,They had to hold their own as best they might in rivalry with a huge
4032,I,"flight of novels of fashionable life, all of them curiously similar in"
4033,I,general treatment. Above these the romances of Plumer Ward rose in a
4034,I,"sort of recognised dignity, as two peaks around which were crowded"
4035,I,"innumerable hillocks. It is necessary to recall readers of to-day, who"
4036,I,"think of _Vivian Grey_ as a work of amazing novelty, to the fact that"
4037,I,the _genre_ it represents to us was one which had been lifted into high
4038,I,"credit the year before by the consecrated success of _Tremaine_, and was"
4039,I,at that moment cultivated by a multitude of minor novelists.
4040,I,
4041,I,"There was, however, a distinction, and it lay in the greater fund of"
4042,I,animal spirits which Disraeli brought to his business. _Vivian Grey_ was
4043,I,"absurd, but it was fresh and popular, and it pleased at once. As the"
4044,I,"opening work of a literary career, it promised well; the impertinent"
4045,I,young gentleman dashed off to Parnassus at a gallop. It was a bold bid
4046,I,"for personal distinction, which the author easily perceived already to"
4047,I,"be ""the only passport to the society of the great in England."" _Vivian"
4048,I,Grey_ is little more than a spirited and daring boy's book; Disraeli
4049,I,"himself called it ""a hot and hurried sketch."" It was a sketch of what he"
4050,I,"had never seen, yet of what he had begun to foresee with amazing"
4051,I,"lucidity. It is a sort of social fairy-tale, where every one has"
4052,I,"exquisite beauty, limitless wealth, and exalted rank, where the"
4053,I,impossible and the hyperbolic are the only homely virtues. There has
4054,I,always been a tendency to exalt _Vivian Grey_ at the expense of _The
4055,I,"Young Duke_ (1831), Disraeli's next leading permanence; and, indeed, the"
4056,I,former has had its admirers who have preferred it to all the others in
4057,I,"this period. The difference is, however, not so marked as might be"
4058,I,"supposed. In _The Young Duke_ the manner is not so burlesque, but there"
4059,I,"is the same roughness of execution, combined with the same rush and"
4060,I,"fire. In either book, what we feel to-day to be the great objection to"
4061,I,our enjoyment is the lack of verisimilitude. Who can believe in the
4062,I,existence of persons whose titles are the Earl of Fitz-Pompey and Baron
4063,I,"Deprivyseal, or whose names are Lady Aphrodite and Sir Carte Blanche?"
4064,I,"The descriptions are ""high-falutin"" beyond all endurance, and there is"
4065,I,"particularly noticeable a kind of stylistic foppery, which is always"
4066,I,hovering between sublimity and a giggle.
4067,I,
4068,I,"But here is an example, from _Vivian Grey_, of Disraeli's earliest"
4069,I,manner:--
4070,I,
4071,I,"""After a moment had passed, he was pouring forth in a rapid voice,"
4072,I,"and incoherent manner, such words as men speak only once. He spoke"
4073,I,"of his early follies, his misfortunes, his misery; of his matured"
4074,I,"views, his settled principles, his plans, his prospects, his hopes,"
4075,I,"his happiness, his bliss; and when he had ceased, he listened, in"
4076,I,"his turn, to some small still words, which made him the happiest of"
4077,I,"human beings. He bent down, he kissed the soft silken cheek which"
4078,I,now he could call his own. Her hand was in his; her head sank upon
4079,I,his breast. Suddenly she clung to him with a strong clasp. 'Violet!
4080,I,"my own, my dearest; you are overcome. I have been rash, I have been"
4081,I,"imprudent. Speak, speak, my beloved! say, you are not ill!'"
4082,I,
4083,I,"""She spoke not, but clung to him with a fearful strength, her head"
4084,I,"still upon his breast, her full eyes closed. Alarmed, he raised her"
4085,I,"off the ground, and bore her to the river-side. Water might revive"
4086,I,"her. But when he tried to lay her a moment on the bank, she clung"
4087,I,"to him gasping, as a sinking person clings to a stout swimmer. He"
4088,I,"leant over her; he did not attempt to disengage her arms; and, by"
4089,I,"degrees, by very slow degrees, her grasp loosened. At last her arms"
4090,I,"gave way and fell by her side, and her eyes partly opened."
4091,I,
4092,I,"""'Thank God! Violet, my own, my beloved, say you are better!'"
4093,I,
4094,I,"""She answered not, evidently she did not know him, evidently she"
4095,I,"did not see him. A film was on her sight, and her eye was glassy."
4096,I,"He rushed to the water-side, and in a moment he had sprinkled her"
4097,I,"temples, now covered with a cold dew. Her pulse beat not, her"
4098,I,"circulation seemed suspended. He rubbed the palms of her hands, he"
4099,I,"covered her delicate feet with his coat, and then rushing up the"
4100,I,"bank into the road, he shouted with frantic cries on all sides. No"
4101,I,"one came, no one was near. Again, with a cry of fearful anguish, he"
4102,I,shouted as if an hyena were feeding on his vitals. No sound; no
4103,I,answer. The nearest cottage was above a mile off. He dared not
4104,I,leave her. Again he rushed down to the water-side. Her eyes were
4105,I,"still open, still fixed. Her mouth also was no longer closed. Her"
4106,I,"hand was stiff, her heart had ceased to beat. He tried with the"
4107,I,"warmth of his own body to revive her. He shouted, he wept, he"
4108,I,"prayed. All, all in vain. Again he was in the road, again shouting"
4109,I,like an insane being. There was a sound. Hark! It was but the
4110,I,screech of an owl!
4111,I,
4112,I,"""Once more at the river-side, once more bending over her with"
4113,I,"starting eyes, once more the attentive ear listening for the"
4114,I,soundless breath. No sound! not even a sigh! Oh! what would he have
4115,I,given for her shriek of anguish! No change had occurred in her
4116,I,"position, but the lower part of her face had fallen; and there was"
4117,I,a general appearance which struck him with awe. Her body was quite
4118,I,"cold, her limbs stiffened. He gazed, and gazed, and gazed. He bent"
4119,I,over her with stupor rather than grief stamped on his features. It
4120,I,"was very slowly that the dark thought came over his mind, very"
4121,I,slowly that the horrible truth seized upon his soul. He gave a loud
4122,I,"shriek, and fell on the lifeless body of VIOLET FANE!"""
4123,I,
4124,I,A line in Disraeli's unfortunate tragedy of _Alarcos_ pathetically
4125,I,"admits: ""Ay! ever pert is youth that baffles age!"" The youth of Disraeli"
4126,I,"was ""pert"" beyond all record, and those who cannot endure to be teased"
4127,I,"should not turn to his early romances, or, indeed, to any of his"
4128,I,writings. _Henrietta Temple_ is the boldest attempt he ever made to tell
4129,I,"a great consecutive story of passion, and no doubt there have been those"
4130,I,who have palpitated over the love-at-first-sight of Ferdinand Armine and
4131,I,Henrietta Temple. But Disraeli's serious vein is here over-luscious; the
4132,I,love-passages are too emphatic and too sweet. An early critic spoke of
4133,I,this _dulcia vitia_ of style which we meet with even in _Contarini
4134,I,Fleming_ as the sin by which the young author was most easily beset. His
4135,I,attempts at serious sentiment and pompous reflection are too often
4136,I,"deplorable, because inanimate and stilted. When he warns a heroine"
4137,I,"against an error of judgment by shouting, ""'Tis the madness of the fawn"
4138,I,"who gazes with adoration on the lurid glare of the anaconda's eye,"" or"
4139,I,"murmurs, ""Farewell, my lovely bird; I'll soon return to pillow in thy"
4140,I,"nest,"" we need all the stimulus of his irony and his velocity to carry"
4141,I,us over such marshlands of cold style.
4142,I,
4143,I,"Of these imperfections, fewer are to be found in _Venetia_ and fewest in"
4144,I,_Contarini Fleming_. This beautiful romance is by far the best of
4145,I,"Disraeli's early books, and that in which his methods at this period can"
4146,I,be most favourably studied. A curious shadow of Disraeli himself is
4147,I,thrown over it all; it cannot be styled in any direct sense an
4148,I,"autobiography, and yet the mental and moral experiences of the author"
4149,I,animate every chapter of it. This novel is written with far more ease
4150,I,"and grace than any previous book of the author's, and Contarini gives a"
4151,I,reason which explains the improvement in his creator's manner when he
4152,I,"remarks: ""I wrote with greater facility than before, because my"
4153,I,experience of life was so much increased that I had no difficulty in
4154,I,"making my characters think and act."" _Contarini Fleming_ belongs to"
4155,I,"1831, when its writer, at the comparatively ripe age of twenty-seven,"
4156,I,had already seen a vast deal of man and of the world of Europe.
4157,I,
4158,I,We are not to believe the preposterous account that Contarini-Disraeli
4159,I,gives of his methods of composition:--
4160,I,
4161,I,"""My thoughts, my passion, the rush of my invention, were too quick"
4162,I,for my pen. Page followed page; as a sheet was finished I threw it
4163,I,"on the floor; I was amazed at the rapid and prolific production,"
4164,I,yet I could not stop to wonder. In half a dozen hours I sank back
4165,I,"exhausted, with an aching frame. I rang the bell, ordered some"
4166,I,"refreshment, and walked about the room. The wine invigorated me and"
4167,I,"warmed up my sinking fancy, which, however, required little fuel. I"
4168,I,"set to it again, and it was midnight before I retired to bed."""
4169,I,
4170,I,At this rate we may easily compute that the longest of his novels would
4171,I,be finished in a week. _Contarini Fleming_ seems to have occupied him
4172,I,"the greater part of a year. He liked the public to think of him,"
4173,I,"exquisitely habited, his long essenced hair falling about his eyes,"
4174,I,flinging forth a torrent of musky and mellifluous improvisation; as a
4175,I,"matter of fact he was a very hard worker, laborious in the arts of"
4176,I,composition.
4177,I,
4178,I,It is to be noted that the whole tone of _Contarini Fleming_ is
4179,I,"intensely literary. The appeal to the intellectual, to the fastidious"
4180,I,"reader is incessant. This is an attitude always rare in English fiction,"
4181,I,"but at that epoch almost unknown, and its presence in the writings of"
4182,I,"Disraeli gives them a cachet. Under all the preposterous conversation,"
4183,I,"all the unruly turmoil of description, there runs a strong thread of"
4184,I,"entirely sober, political, and philosophical ambition. Disraeli striving"
4185,I,"with all his might to be a great poet, of the class of Byron and Goethe,"
4186,I,a poet who is also a great mover and master of men--this is what is
4187,I,manifest to us throughout _Contarini Fleming_. It is almost pathetically
4188,I,"manifest, because Disraeli--whatever else he grew to be--never became a"
4189,I,"poet. And here, too, his wonderful clairvoyance, and his command over"
4190,I,"the vagaries of his own imagination, come into play, for he never"
4191,I,"persuades himself, with all his dithyrambics, that Contarini is quite a"
4192,I,poet.
4193,I,
4194,I,"A new influence is felt upon his style, and it is a highly beneficial"
4195,I,"one. Up to this date, Disraeli had kept Byron before him, and in his"
4196,I,serious moments he had endeavoured to accomplish in prose what the
4197,I,mysterious and melancholy poet of the preceding generation had done in
4198,I,"verse. The general effect of this Byronism, in spite of a certain"
4199,I,"buoyancy which carried the reader onwards, had been apt to be wearisome,"
4200,I,in consequence of the monotony of effort. The fancy of the author had
4201,I,"been too uniformly grandiose, and in the attempt to brighten it up he"
4202,I,had sometimes passed over into positive failure. The most unyielding
4203,I,admirers of his early novels can hardly contradict a reader who
4204,I,complains that he finds the adventures of the bandits at Jonstorna
4205,I,insupportable and the _naïveté_ of Christiana mawkish. There are pages
4206,I,"in _Alroy_ that read as if they were written for a wager, to see how"
4207,I,much balderdash the public will endure. Disraeli seems to have been
4208,I,"conscious of this weakness, and he tried to relieve the pompous gravity"
4209,I,of his passionate scenes by episodes of irony and satire. From his
4210,I,"earliest days these were apt to be very happy; they were inspired,"
4211,I,"especially in the squibs, by Lucian and Swift."
4212,I,
4213,I,"But in _Contarini Fleming_ we detect a new flavour, and it is a very"
4214,I,fortunate one. The bitterness of Swift was never quite in harmony with
4215,I,"the genius of Disraeli, but the irony of Voltaire was. The effect of"
4216,I,reading _Zadig_ and _Candide_ was the completion of the style of
4217,I,"Disraeli; that ""strange mixture of brilliant fantasy and poignant truth"""
4218,I,which he rightly perceived to be the essence of the philosophic _contes_
4219,I,"of Voltaire, finished his own intellectual education. Henceforth he does"
4220,I,not allow his seriousness to overweigh his liveliness; if he detects a
4221,I,"tendency to bombast, he relieves it with a brilliant jest. Count de"
4222,I,"Moltke and the lampoons offer us a case to our hand; ""he was just the"
4223,I,"old fool who would make a cream cheese,"" says Contarini, and the"
4224,I,startled laugh which greets him is exactly of the same order as those
4225,I,which were wont to reward the statesman's amazing utterances in
4226,I,Parliament.
4227,I,
4228,I,"In spite of a certain undeniable insipidity, the volumes of _Contarini"
4229,I,Fleming_ cannot but be read with pleasure. The mixture of Byron and
4230,I,"Voltaire is surprising, but it produces some agreeable effects. There is"
4231,I,"a dash of Shelley in it, too, for the life on the isle of Paradise with"
4232,I,Alcesté Contarini is plainly borrowed from _Epiphsychidion_. Disraeli
4233,I,"does not even disdain a touch of ""Monk"" Lewis without his"
4234,I,"voluptuousness, and of Mrs. Radcliffe without her horrors, for he is"
4235,I,bent on serving up an olio entirely in the taste of the day. But through
4236,I,"it all he is conspicuously himself, and the dedication to beauty and the"
4237,I,extraordinary intellectual exultation of such a book as _Contarini
4238,I,Fleming_ are borrowed from no exotic source.
4239,I,
4240,I,It is impossible to overlook the fascination which Venice exercises
4241,I,over Disraeli in these early novels. Contarini's great ambition was to
4242,I,"indite ""a tale which should embrace Venice and Greece."" Byron's _Life"
4243,I,and Letters_ and the completion of Rogers' _Italy_ with Turner's
4244,I,paradisaical designs had recently awakened to its full the romantic
4245,I,"interest which long had been gathering around ""the sun-girt city."""
4246,I,"Whenever Disraeli reaches Venice his style improves, and if he mourns"
4247,I,"over her decay, his spirits rise when he has to describe her"
4248,I,enchantments by moonlight. He reserves his most delicate effects for
4249,I,Greece and Venice:--
4250,I,
4251,I,"""A Grecian sunset! The sky is like the neck of a dove! the rocks"
4252,I,and waters are bathed with a violet light. Each moment it changes;
4253,I,each moment it shifts into more graceful and more gleaming shadows.
4254,I,"And the thin white moon is above all; the thin white moon, followed"
4255,I,"by a single star, like a lady by a page."""
4256,I,
4257,I,"There are many passages as sumptuous as this in _Venetia_, the romance"
4258,I,"about Byron and Shelley, which Disraeli was thought indiscreet in"
4259,I,publishing so soon after Byron's death. In the story the heroine Venetia
4260,I,is the daughter of Shelley (Marmion Herbert) and the bride of Byron
4261,I,"(Lord Cadurcis). Marmion is a most melodramatic figure, but the"
4262,I,"indiscretions are not noticeable nowadays, while the courage with which"
4263,I,the reviled and hated Shelley is described in the preface to Lord
4264,I,"Lyndhurst as one of ""the most renowned and refined spirits that have"
4265,I,"adorned these our latter days"" is highly characteristic of Disraeli. The"
4266,I,reception of Lord Cadurcis in the House of Peers and the subsequent riot
4267,I,"in Palace Yard mark, perhaps, the highest point in direct narrative"
4268,I,"power which the novelist had yet reached; but _Venetia_ was not liked,"
4269,I,and Disraeli withdrew from literature into public life.
4270,I,
4271,I,
4272,II,II
4273,II,
4274,II,"When Disraeli resumed the art of the novelist, he was no longer talking"
4275,II,of what lay outside his experience when he touched on politics. In 1837
4276,II,"he had entered the House at last, as Member for Maidstone, and although"
4277,II,his enemies roared him down on the first occasion of his rising to
4278,II,"speak, he soon learned how to impose his voice on Parliament. In 1839"
4279,II,"his declaration that ""the rights of labour are as sacred as the rights"
4280,II,"of property"" made him famous, and in 1841 he was one of Sir Robert"
4281,II,Peel's Conservative army in the House. Then followed the formation of
4282,II,"the Young England Party, with Disraeli as one of its leaders; these men"
4283,II,"broke away from Peel, and held that the Tory Party required stringent"
4284,II,"reform from within. It was in 1843 that Henry Thomas Hope, of Deepdene,"
4285,II,"urged, at a meeting of the Young Englanders, the expediency of"
4286,II,"Disraeli's ""treating in a literary form those views and subjects which"
4287,II,"were the matter of their frequent conversations."" Disraeli instantly"
4288,II,"returned to literary composition, and produced in quick succession the"
4289,II,four books which form the second section of his work as an author; these
4290,II,"are _Coningsby_, _Sybil_, _Tancred_, and the _Life of Lord George"
4291,II,Bentinck_.
4292,II,
4293,II,"In this group of books we observe, in the first place, a great advance"
4294,II,in vitality and credibility over the novels of the earlier period.
4295,II,"Disraeli is now describing what he knows, no longer what he hopes in"
4296,II,"process of time to know. He writes from within, no longer from without"
4297,II,the world of political action. These three novels and a biography are
4298,II,"curiously like one another in form, and all equally make a claim to be"
4299,II,"considered not mere works of entertainment, but serious contributions to"
4300,II,political philosophy. The assumption is borne out by the character of
4301,II,"the books, each of which had a definite aim and purpose. _Coningsby_"
4302,II,was designed to make room for new talent in the Tory Party by an
4303,II,"unflinching attack on the ""mediocrities."" In _Sybil_ the heartless abuse"
4304,II,of capital and the vices of class distinction are exposed. _Tancred_ is
4305,II,a vision of better things to follow upon the reforms already indicated.
4306,II,"In _Lord George Bentinck_, under the guise of a record of the struggle"
4307,II,"between Protection and Free Trade, we have a manual of personal conduct"
4308,II,as applied to practical politics.
4309,II,
4310,II,In all these works narrative pure and simple inclines to take a
4311,II,"secondary place. It does so least in _Coningsby_ which, as a story, is"
4312,II,"the most attractive book of Disraeli's middle period, and one of the"
4313,II,most brilliant studies of political character ever published. The tale
4314,II,"is interspersed with historical essays, which impede its progress but"
4315,II,"add to its weight and value. Where, however, the author throws himself"
4316,II,"into his narrative, the advance he has made in power, and particularly"
4317,II,"in truth of presentment, is very remarkable. In the early group of his"
4318,II,novels he had felt a great difficulty in transcribing conversations so
4319,II,"as to produce a natural and easy effect. He no longer, in _Coningsby_,"
4320,II,is confronted by this artificiality. His dialogues are now generally
4321,II,remarkable for their ease and nature. The speeches of Rigby (who
4322,II,"represents John Wilson Croker), of Lord Monmouth (who stands for Lord"
4323,II,"Hertford), of the Young Englanders themselves, of the laughable chorus"
4324,II,"of Taper and Tadpole, who never ""despaired of the Commonwealth,"" are"
4325,II,often extremely amusing. In _Coningsby_ we have risen out of the
4326,II,rose-coloured mist of unreality which hung over books like _The Young
4327,II,Duke_ and _Henrietta Temple_. The agitated gentleman whose peerage hangs
4328,II,"in the balance, and who on hearing that the Duke of Wellington is with"
4329,II,"the King breathes out in a sigh of relief ""Then there _is_ a"
4330,II,"Providence,"" is a type of the subsidiary figure which Disraeli had now"
4331,II,learned to introduce with infinite lightness of irony.
4332,II,
4333,II,"Disraeli had a passion for early youth, and in almost all his books he"
4334,II,dwells lovingly upon its characteristics. It is particularly in
4335,II,"_Contarini Fleming_ and in _Coningsby_--that is to say, in the best"
4336,II,novels of his first and of his second period--that he lingers over the
4337,II,picture of schoolboy life with tenderness and sympathy. We have only to
4338,II,"compare them, however, to see how great an advance he had made in ten"
4339,II,years in his power of depicting such scenes. The childish dreams of
4340,II,"Contarini are unchecked romance, and though the friendship with Musæus"
4341,II,"is drawn with delicacy and insight, and though that is an extremely"
4342,II,"pretty scene where Christiana soothes the pride of Contarini, yet a"
4343,II,manliness and a reality are missing which we find in the wonderful Eton
4344,II,scenes of _Coningsby_.
4345,II,
4346,II,Disraeli's comprehension of the feelings of half-grown ambitious boys of
4347,II,"good family was extraordinary, and when we consider that he had never"
4348,II,"been to a public school, his picture of the life and conversation at"
4349,II,Eton is remarkable for its fidelity to nature. The relation of the elder
4350,II,schoolboys to one another--a theme to which he was fond of recurring--is
4351,II,"treated in a very adroit and natural spirit, not without a certain"
4352,II,Dorian beauty. This preoccupation with the sentiments and passions of
4353,II,schoolboys was rather crudely found fault with at the time. We need have
4354,II,no difficulty in comprehending the pleasure he felt in watching the
4355,II,expansion of those youthful minds from whom he hoped for all that was to
4356,II,make England wise and free. The account of Coningsby's last night at
4357,II,"Eton is one of the most deeply felt pages which Disraeli ever composed,"
4358,II,and here it may be said that the careful avoidance of all humour--an act
4359,II,of self-denial which a smaller writer would not have been capable of--is
4360,II,justified by the dignified success of a very dangerous experiment.
4361,II,
4362,II,The portraiture of living people is performed with the greatest
4363,II,good-nature. It is difficult to believe that the most sensitive and the
4364,II,"most satirised could really be infuriated, so kindly and genial is the"
4365,II,caricaturing. We are far here from Swift's bludgeon and from Voltaire's
4366,II,"poisoned needle. The regeneration of the social order in England, as"
4367,II,"Disraeli dreamed it, involved the removal of some mediocrities, but he"
4368,II,"was neither angry nor impatient. The ""brilliant personages who had just"
4369,II,"scampered up from Melton, thinking it probable that Sir Robert might"
4370,II,"want some moral Lords of the Bedchamber,"" and the Duke, who ""might have"
4371,II,"acquired considerable information, if he had not in his youth made so"
4372,II,"many Latin verses,"" were true to their principles, and would scarcely"
4373,II,have done more than blush faintly when he poked his fun at them. Of all
4374,II,"the portraits none is more interesting than that of the dark, pale"
4375,II,"stranger, Sidonia, as he revealed himself to Coningsby at the inn in the"
4376,II,"forest, over the celebrated dish of ""still-hissing bacon and eggs that"
4377,II,"looked like tufts of primroses."" This was a figure which was to recur,"
4378,II,and to become in the public mind almost coincident with that of Disraeli
4379,II,himself.
4380,II,
4381,II,When we pass from _Coningsby_ to _Sybil_ we find the purely narrative
4382,II,interest considerably reduced in the pursuit of a scheme of political
4383,II,philosophy. This is of all Disraeli's novels the one which most
4384,II,resembles a pamphlet on a serious topic. For this reason it has never
4385,II,"been a favourite among his works, and his lighter readers have passed it"
4386,II,"over with a glance. _Sybil_, however, is best not read at all if it is"
4387,II,"not carefully studied. In the course of _Coningsby_, that young hero had"
4388,II,"found his way to Manchester, and had discovered in it a new world,"
4389,II,"""poignant with new ideas, and suggestive of new trains of thought and"
4390,II,"feeling."" His superficial observation had revealed many incongruities in"
4391,II,"our methods of manipulating wealth, and Disraeli had sketched the"
4392,II,portrait of Mr. Jawster Sharp with a superfluity of sarcastic wit. But
4393,II,it was not until somewhat later that the condition of the
4394,II,working-classes in our northern manufacturing districts began to attract
4395,II,"his most serious attention. The late Duke of Rutland, that illustrious"
4396,II,and venerable friend who alone survived in the twentieth century to bear
4397,II,"witness to the sentiments of Young England, told me that he accompanied"
4398,II,"Disraeli on the journey which led to the composition of Sybil, and that"
4399,II,"he never, in long years of intimacy, saw him so profoundly moved as he"
4400,II,was at the aspect of the miserable dwellings of the hand-loom workers.
4401,II,
4402,II,"All this is reflected on the surface of _Sybil_, and, notwithstanding"
4403,II,"curious faults in execution, the book bears the impress of a deep and"
4404,II,"true emotion. Oddly enough, the style of Disraeli is never more stilted"
4405,II,"than it is in the conversations of the poor in this story. When Gerard,"
4406,II,"the weaver, wishes to prevent the police-inspector from arresting his"
4407,II,"daughter, he remarks: ""Advance and touch this maiden, and I will fell"
4408,II,"you and your minions like oxen at their pasture."" Well may the serjeant"
4409,II,"answer, ""You _are_ a queer chap."" Criticism goes further and says, ""You"
4410,II,"are a chap who never walked in wynd or factory of a Yorkshire town."""
4411,II,"This want of nature, which did not extend to Disraeli's conversations"
4412,II,"among well-to-do folks, was a real misfortune, and gave _Sybil_ no"
4413,II,chance of holding its own in rivalry with such realistic studies of the
4414,II,depression of trade in Manchester as Mrs. Gaskell was presently to
4415,II,"produce, nor with the ease of dialogue in Dickens' Christmas Stories,"
4416,II,which were just now (in 1845) running their popular course. A happier
4417,II,"simplicity of style, founded on a closer familiarity, would have given"
4418,II,"fresh force to his burning indignation, and have helped the cause of"
4419,II,Devils-dust and Dandy Mick. But the accident of stilted speech must not
4420,II,blind us to the sincere and glowing emotion that inspired the pictures
4421,II,of human suffering in _Sybil_.
4422,II,
4423,II,"Then followed _Tancred_, which, as it has always been reported,"
4424,II,continued to the last to be the author's favourite among his literary
4425,II,offspring. Disraeli had little sympathy with either of the great parties
4426,II,"which in that day governed English political life. As time went on, he"
4427,II,"became surer than ever of the degeneracy of modern society, and he began"
4428,II,to despair of discovering any cure for it. In _Tancred_ he laid aside in
4429,II,great measure his mood of satirical extravagance. The whole of this book
4430,II,"is steeped in the colours of poetry--of poetry, that is to say, as the"
4431,II,florid mind of Disraeli conceived it. It opens--as all his books love to
4432,II,open--with the chronicle of an ardent and innocent boy's career. This is
4433,II,"commonplace, but when Tancred, who is mainly the author's customary type"
4434,II,"of young Englishman born in the purple, arrives in the Holy Land, a"
4435,II,flush of pure romance passes over the whole texture of the narrative.
4436,II,"Real life is forgotten, and we move in a fabulous, but intensely"
4437,II,"picturesque, world of ecstasy and dream."
4438,II,
4439,II,"The Prerogation of Judaism, as it had been laid down by Sidonia in"
4440,II,"_Coningsby_, is emphasised and developed, and is indeed made the central"
4441,II,theme of the story in _Tancred_. This novel is inspired by an outspoken
4442,II,and enthusiastic respect for the Hebrew race and a perfect belief in its
4443,II,"future. In the presence of the mighty monuments of Jerusalem, Disraeli"
4444,II,forgets that he is a Christian and an ambitious member of the English
4445,II,"Parliament. His only solicitude is to recover his privileges as a Jew,"
4446,II,and to recollect that he stands in the majestic cradle of his race. He
4447,II,becomes interpenetrated with solemn mysticism; a wind of faith blows in
4448,II,"his hair. He cries, ""God never spoke except to an Arab,"" and we are"
4449,II,therefore not surprised to find an actual Divine message presently
4450,II,pronounced in Tancred's ears as he stands on the summit of Mount Sinai.
4451,II,"This is, perhaps, the boldest flight of imagination which occurs in the"
4452,II,writings of Disraeli. Tancred endeavours to counteract the purely
4453,II,Hebraic influences of Palestine by making a journey of homage to
4454,II,"Astarte, a mysterious and beautiful Pagan queen--an ""Aryan,"" as he loves"
4455,II,to put it--who reigns in the mountains of Syria. But even she does not
4456,II,encourage him to put his trust in the progress of Western Europe.
4457,II,
4458,II,"_Tancred_ is written in Disraeli's best middle style, full, sonorous,"
4459,II,"daring, and rarely swelling into bombast. It would even be too uniformly"
4460,II,grave if the fantastic character of Facredeen did not relieve the
4461,II,solemnity of the discourse with his amusing tirades. Like that of all
4462,II,"Disraeli's novels, the close of this one is dim and unsatisfactory. If"
4463,II,there is anything that the patient reader wants to know it is how the
4464,II,Duke and Duchess of Bellemont behaved to the Lady of Bethany when they
4465,II,arrived at Jerusalem and found their son in the kiosk under her
4466,II,palm-tree. But this is curiosity of a class which Disraeli is not
4467,II,"unwilling to awaken, but which he never cares to satisfy. He places the"
4468,II,"problems in a heap before us, and he leaves us to untie the knots. It is"
4469,II,a highly characteristic trait of his mind as a writer that he is for
4470,II,"ever preoccupied with the beginnings of things, and as little as"
4471,II,possible with their endings.
4472,II,
4473,II,"It is not, however, from _Tancred_ but from _Coningsby_, that we take"
4474,II,our example of Disraeli's second manner:--
4475,II,
4476,II,"""Even to catch Lord Monmouth's glance was not an easy affair; he"
4477,II,"was much occupied on one side by the great lady, on the other were"
4478,II,several gentlemen who occasionally joined in the conversation. But
4479,II,something must be done.
4480,II,
4481,II,"""There ran through Coningsby's character, as we have before"
4482,II,"mentioned, a vein of simplicity which was not its least charm. It"
4483,II,"resulted, no doubt, in a great degree from the earnestness of his"
4484,II,"nature. There never was a boy so totally devoid of affectation,"
4485,II,"which was remarkable, for he had a brilliant imagination, a quality"
4486,II,"that, from its fantasies, and the vague and indefinite desires it"
4487,II,"engenders, generally makes those whose characters are not formed,"
4488,II,"affected. The Duchess, who was a fine judge of character, and who"
4489,II,"greatly regarded Coningsby, often mentioned this trait as one"
4490,II,"which, combined with his great abilities and acquirements so"
4491,II,"unusual at his age, rendered him very interesting. In the present"
4492,II,"instance it happened that, while Coningsby was watching his"
4493,II,"grandfather, he observed a gentleman advance, make his bow, say and"
4494,II,"receive a few words and retire. This little incident, however, made"
4495,II,"a momentary diversion in the immediate circle of Lord Monmouth, and"
4496,II,before they could all resume their former talk and fall into their
4497,II,"previous positions, an impulse sent forth Coningsby, who walked up"
4498,II,"to Lord Monmouth, and standing before him, said,"
4499,II,
4500,II,"""'How do you do, grandpapa?'"
4501,II,
4502,II,"""Lord Monmouth beheld his grandson. His comprehensive and"
4503,II,penetrating glance took in every point with a flash. There stood
4504,II,"before him one of the handsomest youths he had ever seen, with a"
4505,II,mien as graceful as his countenance was captivating; and his whole
4506,II,air breathing that freshness and ingenuousness which none so much
4507,II,appreciates as the used man of the world. And this was his child;
4508,II,the only one of his blood to whom he had been kind. It would be an
4509,II,exaggeration to say that Lord Monmouth's heart was touched; but his
4510,II,"good-nature effervesced, and his fine taste was deeply gratified."
4511,II,He perceived in an instant such a relation might be a valuable
4512,II,adherent; an irresistible candidate for future elections: a
4513,II,brilliant tool to work out the Dukedom. All these impressions and
4514,II,"ideas, and many more, passed through the quick brain of Lord"
4515,II,"Monmouth ere the sound of Coningsby's words had seemed to cease,"
4516,II,and long before the surrounding guests had recovered from the
4517,II,"surprise which they had occasioned them, and which did not"
4518,II,"diminish, when Lord Monmouth, advancing, placed his arms round"
4519,II,Coningsby with a dignity of affection that would have become Louis
4520,II,"XIV., and then, in the high manner of the old Court, kissed him on"
4521,II,each cheek.
4522,II,
4523,II,"""'Welcome to your home,' said Lord Monmouth. 'You have grown a"
4524,II,great deal.'
4525,II,
4526,II,"""Then Lord Monmouth led the agitated Coningsby to the great lady,"
4527,II,"who was a Princess and an Ambassadress, and then, placing his arm"
4528,II,"gracefully in that of his grandson, he led him across the room, and"
4529,II,"presented him in due form to some royal blood that was his guest,"
4530,II,in the shape of a Russian Grand Duke. His Imperial Highness
4531,II,received our hero as graciously as the grandson of Lord Monmouth
4532,II,might expect; but no greeting can be imagined warmer than the one
4533,II,he received from the lady with whom the Grand Duke was conversing.
4534,II,"She was a dame whose beauty was mature, but still radiant. Her"
4535,II,figure was superb; her dark hair crowned with a tiara of curious
4536,II,"workmanship. Her rounded arm was covered with costly bracelets, but"
4537,II,"not a jewel on her finely-formed bust, and the least possible rouge"
4538,II,"on her still oval cheek. Madame Colonna retained her charms."""
4539,II,
4540,II,
4541,III,III
4542,III,
4543,III,"Nearly a quarter of a century passed, during which Disraeli slowly rose"
4544,III,"to the highest honours in the State. Lord Derby died, and the novelist,"
4545,III,"already Leader of the House of Commons, found himself called to be Prime"
4546,III,"Minister of England. His first administration, however, was brief, and"
4547,III,in the last days of 1868 he resigned in favour of Mr. Gladstone. The
4548,III,"Liberals were in for five years, and Disraeli, in opposition, found a"
4549,III,sort of tableland stretch in front of him after so much arduous
4550,III,"climbing. It was at this moment, shortly after the resignation of the"
4551,III,"Tory Minister, that the publisher of a magazine approached him with the"
4552,III,request that he would write a novel to appear in its pages. He was
4553,III,"offered, it is said, a sum of money far in excess of what any one, at"
4554,III,"that time, had ever received for ""serial rights."" Disraeli refused the"
4555,III,"offer, but it may have drawn his thoughts back to literature, and in the"
4556,III,"course of 1869, after the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland was"
4557,III,"completed, he found time to write what is unquestionably the greatest of"
4558,III,his literary works--the superb ironic romance of _Lothair_.
4559,III,
4560,III,"Eminent as he was and eminently successful, Disraeli was far, in 1870,"
4561,III,from having conquered public opinion in England. The reception of his
4562,III,"new novel was noisy, and enjoyed to the full the clamours of"
4563,III,"advertisement, but it was not favourable. The critics laughed it to"
4564,III,"scorn, and called it a farce and a failure. The _Quarterly Review_, in"
4565,III,"the course of a savage diatribe, declared that it was ""as dull as"
4566,III,"ditch-water and as flat as a flounder,"" and in a graver mood reproved it"
4567,III,"as a mere ""bid for the bigoted voices of Exeter Hall."" Some of the"
4568,III,"criticisms were not wanting in acumen. It was perceived at once that, as"
4569,III,"Theodora Campion is the heroine of the book, it was an error in art to"
4570,III,"kill her off in the middle of it. Moreover, it is only fair to admit"
4571,III,that if the stormy Parliamentarian life Disraeli had led so long had
4572,III,"given him immense personal advantages, it had also developed some"
4573,III,"defects. It had taught him boundless independence and courage, it had"
4574,III,"given him a rare experience of men and manners, and it had lifted his"
4575,III,satire far above petty or narrow personal considerations. But it had
4576,III,"encouraged a looseness of utterance, a mixture of the colloquial and the"
4577,III,"bombastic, which was unfortunate. In the best parts of _Coningsby_ and"
4578,III,of _Tancred_ he had shown himself a very careless writer of English. But
4579,III,"_Lothair_, even in its corrected form--and the first edition is a"
4580,III,miracle of laxity--is curiously incorrect. It reads as though it were
4581,III,"taken down from the flowing speech of a fine orator, not as though it"
4582,III,"were painfully composed in a study; it contains surprising ellipses,"
4583,III,"strange freaks of grammar. There was all this, and more, to encourage"
4584,III,"the critics, whom Disraeli had gone out of his way to affront in a"
4585,III,"violent epigram, to attack _Lothair_ with contempt and resentment."
4586,III,
4587,III,The critics took irony for timidity; they thought that the sardonic
4588,III,novelist was the dupe of the splendours which he invented and gloated
4589,III,over. But if one thing is more evident than another to-day it is that
4590,III,"this gorgeous story of a noble boy, whose guardians, a Presbyterian earl"
4591,III,"and a Roman cardinal, quarrelled for his soul and for his acres, is an"
4592,III,"immense satire from first to last. In Disraeli's own words, used in"
4593,III,"another sense, the keynote of _Lothair_ is ""mockery blended with Ionian"
4594,III,"splendour."" Never had he mocked so dauntlessly, never had his fancy been"
4595,III,"more exuberant, and those who criticise the magnificence must realise"
4596,III,"that it was intentional. It was thus that Disraeli loved to see life,"
4597,III,"and, most of all, the life he laughed at. He had always been gorgeous,"
4598,III,but he let himself go in _Lothair_; all is like the dream of a Lorenzo
4599,III,dei Medicis or an Aurungzebe. Nothing is done by halves. Muriel Towers
4600,III,"was set on ""the largest natural lake that inland England boasts""--some"
4601,III,lake far larger than Windermere and entirely unsuspected by geographers.
4602,III,"This piece of water is studded with ""green islands,"" which is natural."
4603,III,But the author cannot stay his hand: this largest of the English lakes
4604,III,"is also alive with ""golden gondolas,"" which are rarer objects. In one of"
4605,III,the odd little flashes of self-criticism which illuminate the book
4606,III,"Lothair says of a certain northern garden, with its fanes and its"
4607,III,"fountains, its glittering statues and its Babylonian terraces, that"
4608,III,"there are ""perhaps too many temples."""
4609,III,
4610,III,"There are perhaps too many temples in the landscape of _Lothair_, but"
4611,III,they were put in on purpose. The splendour is part of the satire. When
4612,III,"the hero has ordered an architect to make some plans for a building, the"
4613,III,"door opens and servants enter bearing ""a large and magnificent portfolio"
4614,III,"of morocco, made of prelatial purple with broad bands of gold and"
4615,III,"alternate ornaments of a cross and a coronet."" It is the sort of"
4616,III,"portfolio that Belshazzar might have used, but no English master-builder"
4617,III,since time began ever launched forth into such splendour. This is
4618,III,characteristic of Disraeli and of his book; it pleased him to wrap all
4619,III,his fancies in jewelled cloth of gold. He chose that the world should
4620,III,"consist of nothing but Tudor palaces in colossal parks, and that time"
4621,III,should be no other than a perpetual Holy Week of golden ceremonial. He
4622,III,"knew his public, and that it adored these follies. He spoke to them in"
4623,III,"the language that they loved, but in a tone of the most seraphical"
4624,III,disdain and irony.
4625,III,
4626,III,What marks the whole of Disraeli's writings more than any other quality
4627,III,is the buoyant and radiant temperament of their author. In _Lothair_ he
4628,III,"is like an inspired and enfranchised boy, set free from all the trammels"
4629,III,"of reality, and yet bringing to the service of his theme the results of"
4630,III,"an extraordinary inherited experience. If the picture is not real, we"
4631,III,"may take courage to say that it is far better than reality--more rich,"
4632,III,"more entertaining, more intoxicating. We have said that it is carelessly"
4633,III,"written, but that is part of the author's superb self-confidence, and"
4634,III,"when he is fortunately inspired, he obtains here an ease of style, a"
4635,III,mastery which he had never found before. The sureness of his touch is
4636,III,"seen in the epigrams which strew the pages of _Lothair_, and have become"
4637,III,"part of our habitual speech--the phrase about eating ""a little fruit on"
4638,III,"a green bank with music""; that which describes the hansom cab, ""'Tis the"
4639,III,"gondola of London."" This may lead us on to the consideration that"
4640,III,Disraeli is one of those who have felt most vividly and expressed most
4641,III,gaily the peculiar physical beauty of London. He saw the Park as the
4642,III,"true Londoner sees it--when ""the chestnuts are in silver bloom, and the"
4643,III,"pink may has flushed the thorns, and banks of sloping turf are radiant"
4644,III,"with plots of gorgeous flowers; when the water glitters in the sun, and"
4645,III,the air is fragrant with that spell which only can be found in
4646,III,"metropolitan mignonette."" He describes as no one else has ever done with"
4647,III,equal mastery a stately and successful house-party in a great country
4648,III,"mansion. He had developed, when he composed _Lothair_, a fuller sense of"
4649,III,"beauty than he had ever possessed before, but it revelled in forms that"
4650,III,were partly artificial and partly fabulous. An example of these forms
4651,III,may now be welcome:--
4652,III,
4653,III,"""Mr. Giles took an early easy opportunity of apprising Lady"
4654,III,"Farringford that she had nearly met Cardinal Grandison at dinner,"
4655,III,and that his Eminence would certainly pay his respects to Mrs.
4656,III,Putney Giles in the evening. As Lady Farringford was at present a
4657,III,"high ritualist, and had even been talked of as 'going to Rome,'"
4658,III,"this intelligence was stunning, and it was observed that her"
4659,III,Ladyship was unusually subdued during the whole of the second
4660,III,course.
4661,III,
4662,III,"""On the right of Lothair sate the wife of a Vice-Chancellor, a"
4663,III,"quiet and pleasing lady, to whom Lothair, with natural good"
4664,III,"breeding, paid snatches of happy attention, when he could for a"
4665,III,moment with propriety withdraw himself from the blaze of
4666,III,Apollonia's coruscating conversation. Then there was a rather
4667,III,"fierce-looking Red Ribbon, medalled as well as be-starred, and the"
4668,III,"Red Ribbon's wife, with a blushing daughter, in spite of her"
4669,III,parentage not yet accustomed to stand fire. A partner and his
4670,III,unusually numerous family had the pleasure also of seeing Lothair
4671,III,"for the first time, and there were no less than four M.P.'s, one of"
4672,III,whom was even in office.
4673,III,
4674,III,"""Apollonia was stating to Lothair, with brilliant perspicuity, the"
4675,III,reasons which quite induced her to believe that the Gulf Stream had

4677,III,might accrue.

4679,III,"""'The religious sentiment of the Southern races must be wonderfully"
4680,III,"affected by a more rigorous climate,' said Apollonia. 'I cannot"
4681,III,"doubt,' she continued, 'that a series of severe winters at Rome"
4682,III,might put an end to Romanism.
4683,III,
4684,III,"""'But is there any fear that a reciprocal influence might be"
4685,III,exercised on the Northern nations?' inquired Lothair. 'Would there
4686,III,be any apprehension of our Protestantism becoming proportionately
4687,III,relaxed?'
4688,III,
4689,III,"""'Of course not,' said Apollonia. 'Truth cannot be affected by"
4690,III,climate. Truth is truth alike in Palestine and Scandinavia.'
4691,III,
4692,III,"""'I wonder what the Cardinal would think of this,' said Lothair,"
4693,III,"'who, you tell me, is coming to you this evening.'"
4694,III,
4695,III,"""'Yes, I am most interested to see him, though he is the most"
4696,III,puissant of our foes. Of course he would take refuge in sophistry;
4697,III,"and science, you know, they deny.'"

4699,III,"""'Cardinal Grandison is giving some lectures on science,' said the"
4700,III,"Vice-Chancellor's lady, quietly."
4701,III,
4702,III,"""'It is remorse,' said Apollonia. 'Their clever men can never"
4703,III,"forget that unfortunate affair of Galileo, and think they can"
4704,III,divert the indignation of the nineteenth century by mock zeal about
4705,III,red sandstone or the origin of species.'
4706,III,
4707,III,"""'And are you afraid of the Gulf Stream?' inquired Lothair of his"
4708,III,calmer neighbour.
4709,III,
4710,III,"""'I think we want more evidence of a change. The Vice-Chancellor"
4711,III,"and I went down to a place we have near town on Saturday, where"
4712,III,"there is a very nice piece of water; indeed, some people call it a"
4713,III,"lake; it was quite frozen, and my boys wanted to skate, but that I"
4714,III,would not permit.'
4715,III,
4716,III,"""'You believe in the Gulf Stream to that extent,' said Lothair; 'no"
4717,III,skating.'
4718,III,
4719,III,"""The Cardinal came early; the ladies had not long left the"
4720,III,dining-room. They were agitated when his name was announced; even
4721,III,Apollonia's heart beat; but then that might be accounted for by the
4722,III,inopportune recollection of an occasional correspondence with
4723,III,Caprera.
4724,III,
4725,III,"""Nothing could exceed the simple suavity with which the Cardinal"
4726,III,"appeared, approached, and greeted them. He thanked Apollonia for"
4727,III,"her permission to pay his respects to her, which he had long"
4728,III,"wished to do; and then they were all presented, and he said exactly"
4729,III,"the right thing to every one."""
4730,III,
4731,III,"Disraeli began his career, as I have pointed out in the earlier part of"
4732,III,"this essay, as a purveyor of entertainment to the public in a popular"
4733,III,and not very dignified kind. He contended with the crowd of fashionable
4734,III,novelists whose books consoled the leisure of Mrs. Wititterly as she
4735,III,reclined on the drawing-room sofa. He found rivals in Bulwer and Mrs.
4736,III,"Gore, and a master in Plumer Ward. His brilliant stories sold, but at"
4737,III,"first they won him little advantage. Slowly, by dint of his inherent"
4738,III,"force of genius, his books have not merely survived their innumerable"
4739,III,"fellows, but they have come to represent to us the form and character of"
4740,III,"a whole school; nay, more, they have come to take the place in our"
4741,III,"memories of a school which, but for them, would have utterly passed away"
4742,III,"and been forgotten. Disraeli, accordingly, is unique, not merely because"
4743,III,his are the only fashionable novels of the pre-Victorian era which any
4744,III,"one ever reads nowadays, but because in his person that ineffable manner"
4745,III,"of the ""thirties"" reaches an isolated sublimity and finds a permanent"
4746,III,place in literature. But if we take a still wider view of the literary
4747,III,"career of Disraeli, we are bound to perceive that the real source of the"
4748,III,interest which his brilliant books continue to possess is the evidence
4749,III,their pages reveal of the astonishing personal genius of the man. Do
4750,III,"what we will, we find ourselves looking beyond Contarini Fleming and"
4751,III,"Sidonia and Vivian Grey to the adventurous Jew who, by dint of infinite"
4752,III,"resolution and an energy which never slept, conquered all the prejudices"
4753,III,"of convention, and trod English society beneath his foot in the"
4754,III,triumphant irony of success. It is the living Disraeli who is always
4755,III,more salient than the most fascinating of his printed pages.

4767,AN OPEN LETTER,AN OPEN LETTER
4768,AN OPEN LETTER,
4769,AN OPEN LETTER,"Dear Lady Burghclere,"
4770,AN OPEN LETTER,
4771,AN OPEN LETTER,"When we met for the first time after the death of our friend, you"
4772,AN OPEN LETTER,"desired me to produce what you were kind enough to call ""one of my"
4773,AN OPEN LETTER,"portraits."" But the art of the portrait-writer is capricious, and"
4774,AN OPEN LETTER,at that time I felt wholly disinclined for the adventure. I excused
4775,AN OPEN LETTER,myself on the ground that the three thick volumes of her
4776,AN OPEN LETTER,"reminiscences made a further portrait needless, and I reflected,"
4777,AN OPEN LETTER,"though I did not say, that the difficulties of presenting the"
4778,AN OPEN LETTER,evanescent charm and petulant wit of Lady Dorothy were insuperable.
4779,AN OPEN LETTER,"I partly think so still, but your command has lingered in my memory"
4780,AN OPEN LETTER,"all these months, and I have determined to attempt to obey you,"
4781,AN OPEN LETTER,"although what I send you can be no ""portrait,"" but a few leaves"
4782,AN OPEN LETTER,torn out of a painter-writer's sketch-book.
4783,AN OPEN LETTER,
4784,AN OPEN LETTER,"The existence of the three published volumes does, after all, not"
4785,AN OPEN LETTER,"preclude a more intimate study, because they are confessedly"
4786,AN OPEN LETTER,"exterior. They represent what she saw and heard, not what others"
4787,AN OPEN LETTER,"perceived in her. In the first place, they are very much better"
4788,AN OPEN LETTER,written than she would have written them herself. I must dwell
4789,AN OPEN LETTER,"presently on the curious fact that, with all her wit, she"
4790,AN OPEN LETTER,possessed no power of sustained literary expression. Her Memoirs
4791,AN OPEN LETTER,"were composed, as you know, by Mr. Ralph Nevill, who is a practised"
4792,AN OPEN LETTER,writer and not otherwise could they have been given to the public.
4793,AN OPEN LETTER,"On this point her own evidence is explicit. She wrote to me, in all"
4794,AN OPEN LETTER,"the excitement of the success of the volume of 1906: ""The Press has"
4795,AN OPEN LETTER,"been wonderfully good to my little efforts, but to Ralph the better"
4796,AN OPEN LETTER,"part is due, as, out of the tangled remnants of my brain, he"
4797,AN OPEN LETTER,"extracted these old anecdotes of my early years."" This is as"
4798,AN OPEN LETTER,"bravely characteristic of her modesty as it is of her candour, but"
4799,AN OPEN LETTER,I think it shows that there is still room for some record of the
4800,AN OPEN LETTER,more intimate features of her charming and elusive character. I
4801,AN OPEN LETTER,"take up my pencil, but with little hope of success, since no more"
4802,AN OPEN LETTER,"formidable task could be set me. I will at least try to be, as she"
4803,AN OPEN LETTER,"would have scorned me for not being, sincere."
4804,AN OPEN LETTER,
4805,AN OPEN LETTER,My friendship with Lady Dorothy Nevill occupied more than a quarter
4806,AN OPEN LETTER,of a century. I met her first in the house of Sir Redvers and Lady
4807,AN OPEN LETTER,"Audrey Buller in the winter of 1887, soon after their return from"
4808,AN OPEN LETTER,Ireland. She had done me the great honour of desiring that I should
4809,AN OPEN LETTER,"be invited to meet her. She had known my venerable relative, the"
4810,AN OPEN LETTER,"zoologist, Thomas Bell of Selborne, and she had corresponded in"
4811,AN OPEN LETTER,"years long past, about entomology, with my father. We talked"
4812,AN OPEN LETTER,"together on that first occasion for hours, and it seems to me that"
4813,AN OPEN LETTER,"I was lifted, without preliminaries, into her intimacy. From that"
4814,AN OPEN LETTER,"afternoon, until I drank tea with her for the last time, ten days"
4815,AN OPEN LETTER,"before her death, the precious link was never loosened."
4816,AN OPEN LETTER,
4817,AN OPEN LETTER,"In 1887, her great social popularity had not begun. She was, I now"
4818,AN OPEN LETTER,"know, already near sixty, but it never occurred to me to consider"
4819,AN OPEN LETTER,"her age. She possessed a curious static quality, a perennial"
4820,AN OPEN LETTER,youthfulness. Every one must have observed how like Watts' picture
4821,AN OPEN LETTER,of her at twenty she still was at eighty-six. This was not
4822,AN OPEN LETTER,"preserved by any arts or fictile graces. She rather affected,"
4823,AN OPEN LETTER,"prematurely, the dress and appearance of an elderly woman. I"
4824,AN OPEN LETTER,"remember her as always the same, very small and neat, very pretty"
4825,AN OPEN LETTER,"with her chiselled nose, the fair oval of her features, the"
4826,AN OPEN LETTER,"slightly ironic, slightly meditative smile, the fascinating colour"
4827,AN OPEN LETTER,"of the steady eyes, beautifully set in the head, with the eyebrows"
4828,AN OPEN LETTER,"rather lifted as in a perpetual amusement of curiosity. Her head,"
4829,AN OPEN LETTER,"slightly sunken into the shoulders, was often poised a little"
4830,AN OPEN LETTER,"sideways, like a bird's that contemplates a hemp-seed. She had no"
4831,AN OPEN LETTER,"quick movements, no gestures; she held herself very still. It"
4832,AN OPEN LETTER,"always appeared to me that, in face of her indomitable energy and"
4833,AN OPEN LETTER,"love of observation, this was an unconscious economy of force. It"
4834,AN OPEN LETTER,gave her a very peculiar aspect; I remember once frivolously saying
4835,AN OPEN LETTER,"to her that she looked as though she were going to ""pounce"" at me;"
4836,AN OPEN LETTER,"but she never pounced. When she had to move, she rose energetically"
4837,AN OPEN LETTER,"and moved with determination, but she never wasted a movement. Her"
4838,AN OPEN LETTER,physical strength--and she such a tiny creature--seemed to be
4839,AN OPEN LETTER,"wonderful. She was seldom unwell, although, like most very healthy"
4840,AN OPEN LETTER,"people, she bewailed herself with exaggerated lamentations whenever"
4841,AN OPEN LETTER,anything was the matter with her. But even on these occasions she
4842,AN OPEN LETTER,"defied what she called ""coddling."" Once I found her suffering from"
4843,AN OPEN LETTER,"a cold, on a very chilly day, without a fire, and I expostulated."
4844,AN OPEN LETTER,"She replied, with a sort of incongruity very characteristic of her,"
4845,AN OPEN LETTER,"""Oh! none of your hot bottles for me!"" In her last hours of"
4846,AN OPEN LETTER,consciousness she battled with the doctor's insistence that she
4847,AN OPEN LETTER,"must have a fire in her bedroom, and her children had to conceal"
4848,AN OPEN LETTER,the flame behind screens because she threatened to get out of bed
4849,AN OPEN LETTER,and put it out. Her marvellous physical force has to be insisted
4850,AN OPEN LETTER,"on, for it was the very basis of her character."
4851,AN OPEN LETTER,
4852,AN OPEN LETTER,"Her humorous petulance, her little sharp changes of voice, the"
4853,AN OPEN LETTER,"malice of her downcast eyes, the calmness of her demure and easy"
4854,AN OPEN LETTER,smile--how is any impression to be given of things so fugitive?
4855,AN OPEN LETTER,"Her life, which had not been without its troubles and anxieties,"
4856,AN OPEN LETTER,became one of prolonged and intense enjoyment. I think that this
4857,AN OPEN LETTER,was the main reason of the delight which her company gave to almost
4858,AN OPEN LETTER,"every one. She was like a household blaze upon a rainy day, one"
4859,AN OPEN LETTER,stretched out one's hands to be warmed. She guarded herself against
4860,AN OPEN LETTER,"the charge of being amiable. ""It would be horrid to be amiable,"""
4861,AN OPEN LETTER,"she used to say, and, indeed, there was always a touch of sharpness"
4862,AN OPEN LETTER,about her. She was amused once because I told her she was like an
4863,AN OPEN LETTER,"acidulated drop, half sweet and half sour. ""Oh! any stupid woman"
4864,AN OPEN LETTER,"can be sweet,"" she said, ""it's often another name for imbecile."""
4865,AN OPEN LETTER,
4866,AN OPEN LETTER,She had curious little prejudices and antipathies. I never fathomed
4867,AN OPEN LETTER,"the reason of her fantastic horror of the feasts of the Church,"
4868,AN OPEN LETTER,particularly of Christmas. She always became curiously agitated as
4869,AN OPEN LETTER,"the month of December waned. In her notes she inveighed, in quaint"
4870,AN OPEN LETTER,"alarm, against the impending ""Christmas pains and penalties."" I"
4871,AN OPEN LETTER,think she disliked the disturbance of social arrangements which
4872,AN OPEN LETTER,these festivals entailed. But there was more than that. She was
4873,AN OPEN LETTER,"certainly a little superstitious, in a mocking, eighteenth-century"
4874,AN OPEN LETTER,"sort of way, as Madame du Deffand might have been. She constantly"
4875,AN OPEN LETTER,"said, and still more frequently wrote, ""D.V."" after any project,"
4876,AN OPEN LETTER,even of the most frivolous kind. The idea was that one should be
4877,AN OPEN LETTER,"polite all round, in case of any contingency. When she was in the"
4878,AN OPEN LETTER,"Riviera, she was much interested to hear that the Prince of Monaco"
4879,AN OPEN LETTER,"had built and endowed a handsome church at Monte Carlo. ""Very"
4880,AN OPEN LETTER,"clever of him,"" she said, ""for you never can tell."""
4881,AN OPEN LETTER,
4882,AN OPEN LETTER,Lady Dorothy's entire absence of affectation was eminently
4883,AN OPEN LETTER,"attractive. She would be mistress of herself, though China fell."
4884,AN OPEN LETTER,"Her strange little activities, her needlework, her paperwork, her"
4885,AN OPEN LETTER,"collections, were the wonder of everybody, but she did not require"
4886,AN OPEN LETTER,"approval; she adopted them, in the light of day, for her own"
4887,AN OPEN LETTER,amusement. She never pushed her peculiarities on the notice of
4888,AN OPEN LETTER,"visitors, but, at the same time, if discovered in the act of some"
4889,AN OPEN LETTER,"incredible industry, she went on with it calmly. When she was in"
4890,AN OPEN LETTER,"Heidelberg in 1892 and successive years, what interested her was"
4891,AN OPEN LETTER,the oddity of the students' life; she expatiated to me on their
4892,AN OPEN LETTER,"beer and their sabre-cuts. Whenever I went abroad of late years, I"
4893,AN OPEN LETTER,was exhorted to send her picture post-cards from out-of-the-way
4894,AN OPEN LETTER,"places, and ""Remember that I like vulgar ones best,"" she added"
4895,AN OPEN LETTER,"imperturbably. The story is perhaps known to you of how, in a"
4896,AN OPEN LETTER,"circle of superfine ladies, the conversation turned to food, and"
4897,AN OPEN LETTER,the company outdid one another in protestations of delicacy. This
4898,AN OPEN LETTER,"one could only touch a little fruit, and that one was practically"
4899,AN OPEN LETTER,"confined to a cup of tea. Lady Dorothy, who had remained silent and"
4900,AN OPEN LETTER,"detached, was appealed to as to her opinion. In a sort of loud"
4901,AN OPEN LETTER,"cackling--a voice she sometimes surprisingly adopted--she replied,"
4902,AN OPEN LETTER,"""Oh, give me a blow-out of tripe and onions!"" to the confusion of"
4903,AN OPEN LETTER,"the _précieuses_. She had a wholesome respect for food, quite"
4904,AN OPEN LETTER,"orthodox and old-fashioned, although I think she ate rather"
4905,AN OPEN LETTER,markedly little. But she liked that little good. She wrote to me
4906,AN OPEN LETTER,"once from Cannes, ""This is not an intellectual place, but then the"
4907,AN OPEN LETTER,"body rejoices in the cooking, and thanks God for that."" She liked"
4908,AN OPEN LETTER,"to experiment in foods, and her guests sometimes underwent strange"
4909,AN OPEN LETTER,"surprises. One day she persuaded old Lord Wharncliffe, who was a"
4910,AN OPEN LETTER,"great friend of hers, to send her a basket of guinea-pig, and she"
4911,AN OPEN LETTER,entertained a very distinguished company on a fricassee of this
4912,AN OPEN LETTER,unusual game. She refused to say what the dish was until every one
4913,AN OPEN LETTER,"had heartily partaken, and then Mr. George Russell turned suddenly"
4914,AN OPEN LETTER,"pale and fled from the room. ""Nothing but fancy,"" remarked the"
4915,AN OPEN LETTER,"hostess, composedly. When several years ago there was a proposal"
4916,AN OPEN LETTER,"that we should feed upon horse-flesh, and a purveyor of that dainty"
4917,AN OPEN LETTER,"opened a shop in Mayfair, Lady Dorothy was one of the first of his"
4918,AN OPEN LETTER,"customers. She sallied forth in person, followed by a footman with"
4919,AN OPEN LETTER,"a basket, and bought a joint in the presence of a jeering populace."
4920,AN OPEN LETTER,
4921,AN OPEN LETTER,She had complete courage and absolute tolerance. Sometimes she
4922,AN OPEN LETTER,"pretended to be timid or fanatical, but that was only her fun. Her"
4923,AN OPEN LETTER,toleration and courage would have given her a foremost place among
4924,AN OPEN LETTER,"philanthropists or social reformers, if her tendencies had been"
4925,AN OPEN LETTER,"humanitarian. She might have been another Elizabeth Fry, another"
4926,AN OPEN LETTER,Florence Nightingale. But she had no impulse whatever towards
4927,AN OPEN LETTER,"active benevolence, nor any interest in masses of men and women."
4928,AN OPEN LETTER,"And, above all, she was not an actor, but a spectator in life, and"
4929,AN OPEN LETTER,"she evaded, often with droll agility, all the efforts which people"
4930,AN OPEN LETTER,made to drag her into propagandas of various kinds. She listened to
4931,AN OPEN LETTER,"what they had to say, and she begged for the particulars of"
4932,AN OPEN LETTER,specially awful examples of the abuses they set out to remedy. She
4933,AN OPEN LETTER,"was all sympathy and interest, and the propagandist started with"
4934,AN OPEN LETTER,"this glittering ally in tow; but he turned, and where was she? She"
4935,AN OPEN LETTER,"had slipped off, and was in contemplation of some other scheme of"
4936,AN OPEN LETTER,experience.
4937,AN OPEN LETTER,
4938,AN OPEN LETTER,"She described her life to me, in 1901, as a ""treadmill of"
4939,AN OPEN LETTER,"friendship, perpetually on the go""; and later she wrote: ""I am"
4940,AN OPEN LETTER,"hampered by perpetual outbursts of hospitality in every shape."""
4941,AN OPEN LETTER,"Life was a spectacle to her, and society a congeries of little"
4942,AN OPEN LETTER,"_guignols_, at all of which she would fain be seated, in a front"
4943,AN OPEN LETTER,"stall. If she complained that hospitality ""hampered"" her, it was"
4944,AN OPEN LETTER,"not that it interfered with any occupation or duty, but simply that"
4945,AN OPEN LETTER,she could not eat luncheon at three different houses at once. I
4946,AN OPEN LETTER,remember being greatly amused when I congratulated her on having
4947,AN OPEN LETTER,"enjoyed some eminent public funeral, by her replying, grudgingly:"
4948,AN OPEN LETTER,"""Yes--but I lost another most interesting ceremony through its"
4949,AN OPEN LETTER,"being at the same hour."" She grumbled: ""People are tugging me to"
4950,AN OPEN LETTER,"go and see things,"" not from any shyness of the hermit or"
4951,AN OPEN LETTER,"reluctance to leave her home, but simply because she would gladly"
4952,AN OPEN LETTER,"have yielded to them all. ""Such a nuisance one can't be in two"
4953,AN OPEN LETTER,"places at once, like a bird!"" she remarked to me."
4954,AN OPEN LETTER,
4955,AN OPEN LETTER,"In this relation, her attitude to country life was droll. After"
4956,AN OPEN LETTER,"long indulgence in her amazing social energy in London, she would"
4957,AN OPEN LETTER,suddenly become tired. The phenomenon never ceased to surprise her;
4958,AN OPEN LETTER,"she could not recollect that she had been tired before, and this"
4959,AN OPEN LETTER,must be the end of all things. She would fly to the country; to
4960,AN OPEN LETTER,"Dorsetshire, to Norfolk, to Haslemere, to what she called ""the"
4961,AN OPEN LETTER,"soberness of Ascot."" Then would come letters describing the bliss"
4962,AN OPEN LETTER,"of rural calm. ""Here I am! Just in time to save my life. For the"
4963,AN OPEN LETTER,"future, no clothes and early hours."" That lasted a very short"
4964,AN OPEN LETTER,"while. Then a letter signed ""Your recluse, D.N.,"" would show the"
4965,AN OPEN LETTER,dawn of a return to nature. Then _boutades_ of increasing vehemence
4966,AN OPEN LETTER,"would mark the rising impatience. Sept 12: ""How dreadful it is that"
4967,AN OPEN LETTER,"the country is so full of ladies."" Sept. 15: ""I am surrounded by"
4968,AN OPEN LETTER,"tall women and short women, all very tiresome."" Sept. 20: ""So dull"
4969,AN OPEN LETTER,"here, except for one pleasant episode of a drunken housemaid."""
4970,AN OPEN LETTER,"Sept. 23: ""Oh! I am so longing for the flesh-pots of dear dirty old"
4971,AN OPEN LETTER,"London""; and then one knew that her return to Charles Street would"
4972,AN OPEN LETTER,"not be long delayed. She was very fond indeed of country life, for"
4973,AN OPEN LETTER,"a short time, and she was interested in gardens, but she really"
4974,AN OPEN LETTER,"preferred streets. ""Eridge is such a paradise--especially the"
4975,AN OPEN LETTER,"quadrupeds,"" she once wrote to me from a house in which she found"
4976,AN OPEN LETTER,peculiar happiness. But she liked bipeds best.
4977,AN OPEN LETTER,
4978,AN OPEN LETTER,"However one may postpone the question, sooner or later it is"
4979,AN OPEN LETTER,"necessary to consider the quality of Lady Dorothy Nevill's wit,"
4980,AN OPEN LETTER,since all things converge in her to that. But her wit is so
4981,AN OPEN LETTER,"difficult to define that it is not surprising that one avoids, as"
4982,AN OPEN LETTER,"long as possible, coming actually to grips with it. We may lay the"
4983,AN OPEN LETTER,"foundation of a formula, perhaps, by saying that it was a compound"
4984,AN OPEN LETTER,of solid good sense and an almost reckless whimsicality of speech.
4985,AN OPEN LETTER,The curious thing about it was that it was not markedly
4986,AN OPEN LETTER,"intellectual, and still less literary. It had not the finish of"
4987,AN OPEN LETTER,such wit as is preserved in anthologies of humour. Every one who
4988,AN OPEN LETTER,enjoyed the conversation of Lady Dorothy must have perceived with
4989,AN OPEN LETTER,annoyance how little he could take away with him. Her phrases did
4990,AN OPEN LETTER,"not often recur to please that inward ear, ""which is the bliss of"
4991,AN OPEN LETTER,"solitude."" What she said seemed at the time to be eminently right"
4992,AN OPEN LETTER,and sane; it was exhilarating to a high degree; it was lighted up
4993,AN OPEN LETTER,"by merriment, and piquancy, and salt; but it was the result of a"
4994,AN OPEN LETTER,kind of magic which needed the wand of the magician; it could not
4995,AN OPEN LETTER,"be reproduced by an imitator. It is very unfortunate, but the fact"
4996,AN OPEN LETTER,has to be faced. When we tell our grandchildren that Lady Dorothy
4997,AN OPEN LETTER,"Nevill was the finest female wit of her age, they will ask us for"
4998,AN OPEN LETTER,"examples of her talent, and we shall have very few to give."
4999,AN OPEN LETTER,
5000,AN OPEN LETTER,She liked to discuss people better than books or politics or
5001,AN OPEN LETTER,"principles, although she never shrank from these. But it was what"
5002,AN OPEN LETTER,she said about human beings that kept her interlocutors hanging on
5003,AN OPEN LETTER,"her lips. She made extraordinarily searching strictures on persons,"
5004,AN OPEN LETTER,"without malice, but without nonsense of any kind. Her own"
5005,AN OPEN LETTER,favourites were treated with reserve in this respect: it was as
5006,AN OPEN LETTER,"though they were put in a pen by themselves, not to be criticised"
5007,AN OPEN LETTER,"so long as they remained in favour; and she was not capricious,"
5008,AN OPEN LETTER,"was, on the contrary, conspicuously loyal. But they always had the"
5009,AN OPEN LETTER,impression that it was only by special licence that they escaped
5010,AN OPEN LETTER,the criticism that every one else was subjected to. Lady Dorothy
5011,AN OPEN LETTER,"Nevill was a stringent observer, and no respecter of persons. She"
5012,AN OPEN LETTER,"carried a bow, and shot at folly as it flew. But I particularly"
5013,AN OPEN LETTER,"wish to insist on the fact that her arrows, though they were"
5014,AN OPEN LETTER,"feathered, were not poisoned."
5015,AN OPEN LETTER,
5016,AN OPEN LETTER,Light was thrown on the nature of Lady Dorothy's wit by her
5017,AN OPEN LETTER,correspondence. She could in no accepted sense be called a good
5018,AN OPEN LETTER,"letter-writer, although every now and then brilliantly amusing"
5019,AN OPEN LETTER,phrases occurred in her letters. I doubt whether she ever wrote one
5020,AN OPEN LETTER,"complete epistle; her correspondence consisted of tumultuous,"
5021,AN OPEN LETTER,"reckless, sometimes extremely confused and incorrect notes, which,"
5022,AN OPEN LETTER,"however, repeated--for those who knew how to interpret her"
5023,AN OPEN LETTER,language--the characteristics of her talk. She took no pains with
5024,AN OPEN LETTER,"her letters, and was under no illusion about their epistolary"
5025,AN OPEN LETTER,"value. In fact, she was far too conscious of their lack of form,"
5026,AN OPEN LETTER,"and would sign them, ""Your incompetent old friend""; there was"
5027,AN OPEN LETTER,"generally some apology for ""this ill-written nonsense,"" or ""what"
5028,AN OPEN LETTER,"stuff this is, not worth your reading!"" She once wrote to me: ""I"
5029,AN OPEN LETTER,"should like to tell you all about it, but alas! old Horace"
5030,AN OPEN LETTER,"Walpole's talent has not descended on me."" Unfortunately, that was"
5031,AN OPEN LETTER,true; so far as literary expression and the construction of
5032,AN OPEN LETTER,"sentences went, it had not. Her correspondence could never be given"
5033,AN OPEN LETTER,"to the world, because it would need to be so much revised and"
5034,AN OPEN LETTER,expanded and smoothed out that it would no longer be hers at all.
5035,AN OPEN LETTER,
5036,AN OPEN LETTER,"Nevertheless, her reckless notes were always delightful to receive,"
5037,AN OPEN LETTER,because they gave the person to whom they were addressed a
5038,AN OPEN LETTER,reflection of the writer's mood at the moment. They were ardent and
5039,AN OPEN LETTER,"personal, in their torrent of broken sentences, initials, mis-spelt"
5040,AN OPEN LETTER,names and nouns that had dropped their verbs. They were not so good
5041,AN OPEN LETTER,"as her talk, but they were like enough to it to be highly"
5042,AN OPEN LETTER,stimulating and entertaining; and in the course of them phrases
5043,AN OPEN LETTER,"would be struck out, like sparks from flint, which were nearly as"
5044,AN OPEN LETTER,"good, and of the very same quality, as the things she used to say."
5045,AN OPEN LETTER,She wrote her letters on a fantastic variety of strangely coloured
5046,AN OPEN LETTER,"paper, pink and blue and snuff-brown, violet and green and grey,"
5047,AN OPEN LETTER,"paper that was stamped with patterns like a napkin, or frilled like"
5048,AN OPEN LETTER,"a lace handkerchief, or embossed with forget-me-nots like a child's"
5049,AN OPEN LETTER,"valentine. She had tricks of time-saving; always put ""I"" for ""one,"""
5050,AN OPEN LETTER,"and ""x"" for ""cross,"" a word which she, who was never cross, loved"
5051,AN OPEN LETTER,"to use. ""I did not care for any of the guests; we seemed to live in"
5052,AN OPEN LETTER,"a storm of x questions and crooked answers,"" she would write, or ""I"
5053,AN OPEN LETTER,"am afraid my last letter was rather x."""
5054,AN OPEN LETTER,
5055,AN OPEN LETTER,"Lady Dorothy, as a letter-writer, had no superstitious reverence"
5056,AN OPEN LETTER,"for the parts of speech. Like M. Bergeret, she ""se moquait de"
5057,AN OPEN LETTER,"l'orthographie comme une chose méprisable."" The spelling in her"
5058,AN OPEN LETTER,tumultuous notes threw a light upon that of very fine ladies in the
5059,AN OPEN LETTER,"seventeenth century. She made no effort to be exact, and much of"
5060,AN OPEN LETTER,"her correspondence was made obscure by initials, which she expected"
5061,AN OPEN LETTER,her friends to interpret by divination. From a withering
5062,AN OPEN LETTER,denunciation of the Government she expressly excepts Mr. John Burns
5063,AN OPEN LETTER,"and ""that much-abused Mr. Birhell, whom I like."" From about 1899 to"
5064,AN OPEN LETTER,"1903, I think that Lord Wolseley was the friend who occupied most"
5065,AN OPEN LETTER,of her thoughts. In her letters of those years the references to
5066,AN OPEN LETTER,"him are incessant, but when he is not ""the F.M."" and ""our C.C.,"""
5067,AN OPEN LETTER,"she rings the changes on all possible forms of his name, from"
5068,AN OPEN LETTER,"""Wollesley"" to ""Walsey."" When she wrote to me of the pleasure she"
5069,AN OPEN LETTER,"had had in meeting ""the Abbot Guaschet,"" it took me a moment to"
5070,AN OPEN LETTER,recognise the author of _English Monastic Life_. She would laugh
5071,AN OPEN LETTER,"herself at her spelling, and would rebut any one who teased her"
5072,AN OPEN LETTER,"about it by saying, ""Oh! What does it matter? I don't pretend to be"
5073,AN OPEN LETTER,"a bright specimen--like you!"" When she made arrangements to come to"
5074,AN OPEN LETTER,"see me at the House of Lords, which she frequently did, she always"
5075,AN OPEN LETTER,"wrote it ""the Lord's House,"" as though it were a conventicle."
5076,AN OPEN LETTER,
5077,AN OPEN LETTER,One curious observation which the recipient of hundreds of her
5078,AN OPEN LETTER,"notes is bound to make, is the remarkable contrast between the"
5079,AN OPEN LETTER,general tone of them and the real disposition of their writer. Lady
5080,AN OPEN LETTER,"Dorothy Nevill in person was placid, indulgent, and calm; she never"
5081,AN OPEN LETTER,"raised her voice, or challenged an opinion, or asserted her"
5082,AN OPEN LETTER,"individuality. She played, very consistently, her part of the"
5083,AN OPEN LETTER,amused and attentive spectator in the theatre of life. But in her
5084,AN OPEN LETTER,"letters she pretended to be, or supposed herself called upon to"
5085,AN OPEN LETTER,"seem, passionate and distracted. They are all twinkling with"
5086,AN OPEN LETTER,humorous or petulant exaggeration. She happens to forget an
5087,AN OPEN LETTER,"engagement, which was of no sort of importance, and this is how she"
5088,AN OPEN LETTER,apologises:--
5089,AN OPEN LETTER,
5090,AN OPEN LETTER,"""To think that every hour since you said you would come I have"
5091,AN OPEN LETTER,"repeated to myself--Gosse at 5, Gosse at 5, and then after all to"
5092,AN OPEN LETTER,go meandering off and leaving you to cuss and swear on the
5093,AN OPEN LETTER,"doorstep, and you will never come again now, really. No punishment"
5094,AN OPEN LETTER,here or hereafter will be too much for me. Lead me to the Red Hill
5095,AN OPEN LETTER,"Asylum, and leave me there."""
5096,AN OPEN LETTER,
5097,AN OPEN LETTER,"This was written nearly twenty years ago, and she was not less"
5098,AN OPEN LETTER,vivacious until the end. Lord Lansdowne tells me of an anonymous
5099,AN OPEN LETTER,"letter which he once received, to which she afterwards pleaded"
5100,AN OPEN LETTER,"guilty. A cow used to be kept at the back of Lansdowne House, and"
5101,AN OPEN LETTER,"the animal, no doubt feeling lonely, was in the habit of lowing at"
5102,AN OPEN LETTER,"all sorts of hours. The letter, which was supposed to voice the"
5103,AN OPEN LETTER,"complaint of the neighbours in Charles Street, was couched in the"
5104,AN OPEN LETTER,"broadest Wiltshire dialect, and ended with the postscript: ""Dang"
5105,AN OPEN LETTER,"'un, there 'ee goes again!"" As a matter of fact, her letters, about"
5106,AN OPEN LETTER,"which she had no species of vanity or self-consciousness, were to"
5107,AN OPEN LETTER,her merely instruments of friendship. There was an odd mingling of
5108,AN OPEN LETTER,affection and stiffness in them. She marshalled her acquaintances
5109,AN OPEN LETTER,"with them, and almost invariably they were concerned with"
5110,AN OPEN LETTER,arrangements for meeting or explanations of absence. In my own
5111,AN OPEN LETTER,"experience, I must add that she made an exception when her friends"
5112,AN OPEN LETTER,"were abroad, when she took considerable pains to tell them the"
5113,AN OPEN LETTER,"gossip, often in surprising terms. I was once regaled with her"
5114,AN OPEN LETTER,"experiences as the neighbour of a famous African magnate, and with"
5115,AN OPEN LETTER,"the remark, ""Mrs. ----,"" a London fine lady of repute, ""has been"
5116,AN OPEN LETTER,"here, and has scraped the whole inside out of Mr. ----, and gone"
5117,AN OPEN LETTER,"her way rejoicing."" Nor did she spare the correspondent himself:--"
5118,AN OPEN LETTER,
5119,AN OPEN LETTER,"""Old Dr. ---- has been here, and tells me he admires you very much;"
5120,AN OPEN LETTER,"but I believe he has lost his memory, and he never had good taste"
5121,AN OPEN LETTER,"at any time."""
5122,AN OPEN LETTER,
5123,AN OPEN LETTER,This was not a tribute which self-esteem could hug to its bosom. Of
5124,AN OPEN LETTER,a very notorious individual she wrote to me:--
5125,AN OPEN LETTER,
5126,AN OPEN LETTER,"""I thought I should never be introduced to him, and I had to wait"
5127,AN OPEN LETTER,"100 years, but everything is possible in the best of worlds, and he"
5128,AN OPEN LETTER,"was very satisfactory at last."" Satisfactory! No word could be more"
5129,AN OPEN LETTER,"characteristic on the pen of Lady Dorothy. To be ""satisfactory,"""
5130,AN OPEN LETTER,whether you were the President of the French Republic or Lord
5131,AN OPEN LETTER,Wolseley or the Human Elephant (a pathetic freak in whom she took a
5132,AN OPEN LETTER,"great interest), was to perform on the stage of life, in her"
5133,AN OPEN LETTER,"unruffled presence, the part which you had been called upon by"
5134,AN OPEN LETTER,"Providence to fill. Even a criminal might be ""satisfactory"" if he"
5135,AN OPEN LETTER,did his job thoroughly. The only entirely unsatisfactory people
5136,AN OPEN LETTER,"were those who were insipid, conventional, and empty. ""The first"
5137,AN OPEN LETTER,"principle of society should be to extinguish the bores,"" she once"
5138,AN OPEN LETTER,"said. I remember going with her to the Zoo in 1898, and being"
5139,AN OPEN LETTER,"struck with a remark which she made, not because it was important,"
5140,AN OPEN LETTER,but because it was characteristic. We were looking at the wolves
5141,AN OPEN LETTER,"which she liked; and then, close by, she noticed some kind of"
5142,AN OPEN LETTER,"Indian cow. ""What a bore for the wolves to have to live opposite a"
5143,AN OPEN LETTER,"cow!"" and then, as if talking to herself, ""I do hate a ruminant!"""
5144,AN OPEN LETTER,
5145,AN OPEN LETTER,"Her relations to literature, art, and science were spectacular"
5146,AN OPEN LETTER,"also. She was a sympathetic and friendly onlooker, always on the"
5147,AN OPEN LETTER,"side of those things against the Philistines, but not affecting"
5148,AN OPEN LETTER,special knowledge herself. She was something of a virtuoso. She
5149,AN OPEN LETTER,"once said, ""I have a passion for reading, but on subjects which"
5150,AN OPEN LETTER,"nobody else will touch,"" and this indicated the independence of her"
5151,AN OPEN LETTER,"mind. She read to please herself, and to satisfy her thirst for"
5152,AN OPEN LETTER,"experience. When our friendship began, Zola was in the act of"
5153,AN OPEN LETTER,producing the tremendous series of his Rougon-Macquart novels. It
5154,AN OPEN LETTER,was one of our early themes of conversation. Zola was then an
5155,AN OPEN LETTER,object of shuddering horror to the ordinary English reader. Lady
5156,AN OPEN LETTER,"Dorothy had already read _L'Assommoir_, and had not shrunk from it;"
5157,AN OPEN LETTER,"so I ventured to tell her of _La Terre_, which was just appearing."
5158,AN OPEN LETTER,"She wrote to me about it: ""I have been reading Zola. He takes the"
5159,AN OPEN LETTER,"varnish off rural life, I must say. Oh! these horrid demons of"
5160,AN OPEN LETTER,Frenchmen know how to write. Even the most disgusting things they
5161,AN OPEN LETTER,know how to describe poetically. I wish Zola could describe
5162,AN OPEN LETTER,"Haslemere with all the shops shut, rain falling, and most of the"
5163,AN OPEN LETTER,"inhabitants in their cups."" She told me later--for we followed our"
5164,AN OPEN LETTER,Zola to _Lourdes_ and _Paris_--that some young Oxford prig saw _La
5165,AN OPEN LETTER,"Bête Humaine_ lying on the table at Charles Street, and remarked"
5166,AN OPEN LETTER,"that Lady Dorothy could surely not be aware that that was ""no book"
5167,AN OPEN LETTER,"for a lady."" She said, ""I told him it was just the book for me!"""
5168,AN OPEN LETTER,
5169,AN OPEN LETTER,"She read Disraeli's novels over again, from time to time, with a"
5170,AN OPEN LETTER,"renewal of sentiment. ""I am dedicating my leisure hours to"
5171,AN OPEN LETTER,_Endymion_. What a charm after the beef and mutton of ordinary
5172,AN OPEN LETTER,"novels!"" She gradually developed a cult for Swinburne, whom she had"
5173,AN OPEN LETTER,"once scorned; in her repentance after his death, she wrote: ""I"
5174,AN OPEN LETTER,never hear enough about that genius Swinburne! My heart warms when
5175,AN OPEN LETTER,"I think of him and read his poems."" I think she was very much"
5176,AN OPEN LETTER,annoyed that he had never been a visitor at Charles Street. When
5177,AN OPEN LETTER,"Verlaine was in England, to deliver a lecture, in 1894, Lady"
5178,AN OPEN LETTER,"Dorothy was insistent that, as I was seeing him frequently, I"
5179,AN OPEN LETTER,should bring the author of _Parallelement_ to visit her. She
5180,AN OPEN LETTER,"said--I think under some illusion--""Verlaine is one of my pet"
5181,AN OPEN LETTER,"poets, though,"" she added, ""not of this world."" I was obliged to"
5182,AN OPEN LETTER,"tell her that neither Verlaine's clothes, nor his person, nor his"
5183,AN OPEN LETTER,"habits, admitted of his being presented in Mayfair, and that,"
5184,AN OPEN LETTER,"indeed, it was difficult to find a little French eating-house in"
5185,AN OPEN LETTER,"Soho where he could be at home. She then said: ""Why can't you take"
5186,AN OPEN LETTER,"me to see him in this eating-house?"" I had to explain that of the"
5187,AN OPEN LETTER,alternatives that was really the least possible. She was not
5188,AN OPEN LETTER,pleased.
5189,AN OPEN LETTER,
5190,AN OPEN LETTER,Nor am I pleased with this attempt of mine to draw the features of
5191,AN OPEN LETTER,"our wonderful fairy friend. However I may sharpen the pencil, the"
5192,AN OPEN LETTER,line it makes is still too heavy. I feel that these anecdotes seem
5193,AN OPEN LETTER,"to belie her exquisite refinement, the rapidity and delicacy of her"
5194,AN OPEN LETTER,mental movement. To tell them is like stroking the wings of a moth.
5195,AN OPEN LETTER,"Above all, it is a matter of despair to attempt to define her"
5196,AN OPEN LETTER,emotional nature. Lady Dorothy Nevill was possessed neither of
5197,AN OPEN LETTER,gravity nor of pathos; she was totally devoid of sentimentality.
5198,AN OPEN LETTER,This made it easy for a superficial observer to refuse to believe
5199,AN OPEN LETTER,that the author of so many pungent observations and such apparently
5200,AN OPEN LETTER,volatile cynicism had a heart. When this was once questioned in
5201,AN OPEN LETTER,"company, one who knew her well replied: ""Ah! yes, she has a heart,"
5202,AN OPEN LETTER,"and it is like a grain of mustard-seed!"" But her kindliness was"
5203,AN OPEN LETTER,"shown, with great fidelity, to those whom she really honoured with"
5204,AN OPEN LETTER,her favour. I do not know whether it would be strictly correct to
5205,AN OPEN LETTER,"say that she had the genius of friendship, because that supposes a"
5206,AN OPEN LETTER,certain initiative and action which were foreign to Lady Dorothy's
5207,AN OPEN LETTER,"habits. But she possessed, to a high degree, the genius of"
5208,AN OPEN LETTER,"comradeship. She held the reins very tightly, and she let no one"
5209,AN OPEN LETTER,escape whom she wished to retain. She took immense pains to
5210,AN OPEN LETTER,"preserve her friendships, and indeed became, dear creature, a"
5211,AN OPEN LETTER,little bit tyrannical at last. Her notes grew to be excessively
5212,AN OPEN LETTER,"emphatic. She would begin a letter quite cheerfully with ""Oh, you"
5213,AN OPEN LETTER,"demon!"" or complain of ""total and terrible neglect of an old"
5214,AN OPEN LETTER,friend; I could fill this sheet of paper with an account of your
5215,AN OPEN LETTER,"misdeeds!"" She was ingenious in reproach: ""I cannot afford to waste"
5216,AN OPEN LETTER,"penny after penny, and no assets forthcoming,"" or ""I have only two"
5217,AN OPEN LETTER,"correspondents, and one of them is a traitor; I therefore cease to"
5218,AN OPEN LETTER,"write to you for ever!"" This might sound formidable, but it was"
5219,AN OPEN LETTER,"only one of the constant surprises of her humour, and would be"
5220,AN OPEN LETTER,followed next day by the most placable of notelets.
5221,AN OPEN LETTER,
5222,AN OPEN LETTER,"Her curiosity with regard to life spread to her benevolences, which"
5223,AN OPEN LETTER,often took somewhat the form of voyages of discovery. Among these
5224,AN OPEN LETTER,"her weekly excursion to the London Hospital, in all weathers and in"
5225,AN OPEN LETTER,"every kind of cheap conveyance, was prominent. I have to confess"
5226,AN OPEN LETTER,that I preferred that a visit to her should not be immediately
5227,AN OPEN LETTER,"prefaced by one of these adventures among the ""pore dear things"" at"
5228,AN OPEN LETTER,"the hospital, because that was sure to mean the recital of some"
5229,AN OPEN LETTER,"gruesome operation she had heard of, or the details of some almost"
5230,AN OPEN LETTER,equally gruesome cure. She enjoyed the whole experience in a way
5231,AN OPEN LETTER,"which is blank to the professional humanitarian, but I suspect the"
5232,AN OPEN LETTER,"""pore dear things"" appreciated her listening smile and sympathetic"
5233,AN OPEN LETTER,worldliness much more than they would have done the admonitions of
5234,AN OPEN LETTER,a more conscious philanthropist.
5235,AN OPEN LETTER,
5236,AN OPEN LETTER,"And, indeed, in retrospect, it is her kindliness that shines forth."
5237,AN OPEN LETTER,"She followed all that her friends did, everything that happened to"
5238,AN OPEN LETTER,those who were close to them. She liked always to receive the
5239,AN OPEN LETTER,"tribute of what she called my ""literary efforts,"" and was"
5240,AN OPEN LETTER,"ruthlessly sharp in observing announcements of them: ""Publishing"
5241,AN OPEN LETTER,"again, and of course no copy for poor old me,"" when not a volume"
5242,AN OPEN LETTER,had yet left the binders. She took up absurd little phrases with
5243,AN OPEN LETTER,delightful _camaraderie_; I have forgotten why at one time she
5244,AN OPEN LETTER,"took to signing herself ""Your Koh-i-Noor,"" and wrote: ""If I can"
5245,AN OPEN LETTER,"hope to be the Koh-i-Noor of Mrs. Gosse's party, I shall be sure to"
5246,AN OPEN LETTER,"come on Monday."" One might go on indefinitely reviving these"
5247,AN OPEN LETTER,memories of her random humour and kindly whimsicality. But I close
5248,AN OPEN LETTER,"on a word of tenderer gravity, which I am sure will affect you. She"
5249,AN OPEN LETTER,"had been a little tyrannical, as usual, and perhaps thought the"
5250,AN OPEN LETTER,tone of her persiflage rather excessive; a few hours later came a
5251,AN OPEN LETTER,"second note, which began: ""You have made my life happier for me"
5252,AN OPEN LETTER,"these last years--you, and Lady Airlie, and dearest Winifred."" From"
5253,AN OPEN LETTER,"her who never gave way to sentimentality in any form, and who"
5254,AN OPEN LETTER,"prided herself on being as rigid as a nut-cracker, this was worth"
5255,AN OPEN LETTER,"all the protestations of some more ebullient being. And there, dear"
5256,AN OPEN LETTER,"Lady Burghclere, I must leave this poor sketch for such approval as"
5257,AN OPEN LETTER,you can bring yourself to give it.
5258,AN OPEN LETTER,
5259,AN OPEN LETTER,"Very faithfully yours,"

5266,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS
5267,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5268,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"In the obituary notices which attended the death of Lord Cromer, it was"
5269,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,necessary and proper that almost the whole space at the command of the
5270,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,writers should be taken up by a sketch of his magnificent work as an
5271,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"administrator, or, as the cant phrase goes, ""an empire-builder."" For"
5272,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"thirty years, during which time he advanced to be one of the most"
5273,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"powerful and efficient of proconsuls, he held a place in the political"
5274,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"world which arrested the popular imagination, and must continue to"
5275,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,outweigh all other aspects of his character. Of this side of Lord
5276,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Cromer's splendid career I am not competent to say a word. But there
5277,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"was another facet of it, one more private and individual, which became"
5278,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"prominent after his retirement, I mean his intellectual and literary"
5279,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"activity, which I had the privilege of observing. It would be a pity,"
5280,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"perhaps, to let this be wholly submerged, and I propose to give, from my"
5281,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"own recollection, some features of it. Lord Cromer was the author of six"
5282,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"or seven published volumes, but these are before the public, and it is"
5283,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,needless to speak much about them. What may be found more interesting
5284,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,are a few impressions of his attitude towards books and towards ideas.
5285,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5286,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"On the first occasion on which I met him, he was characteristic. It was"
5287,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"some fifteen years ago, at the time when the brilliant young politicians"
5288,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,who called themselves (or were rather ineptly called) the Hooligans had
5289,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,the graceful habit of asking some of their elders to dine with them in a
5290,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,private room of the House of Commons. At one of these little dinners the
5291,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"only guests were Lord Cromer and myself. I had never seen him before,"
5292,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and I regarded him with some awe and apprehension, but no words had"
5293,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"passed between us, when the division-bell rang, and our youthful hosts"
5294,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,darted from the room.
5295,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5296,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"The moment we were left alone, Lord Cromer looked across the deserted"
5297,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"tablecloth and said quietly, as though he were asking me to pass the"
5298,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"salt, ""Where is Bipontium?"" I was driven by sheer fright into an"
5299,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"exercise of intelligence, and answered at once, ""I should think it must"
5300,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"be the Latin for Zweibrücken. Why?"" ""Oh! I saw this afternoon that my"
5301,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,edition of Diodorus Siculus was printed _ex typographia societatis
5302,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Bipontinæ_, and I couldn't imagine for the life of me what 'Bipontium'"
5303,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"was. No doubt you're quite right."" Nothing could be more characteristic"
5304,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,of Lord Cromer's habit of mind than this sudden revulsion of ideas. His
5305,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"active brain needed no preparation to turn from subject to subject, but"
5306,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"seemed to be always ready, at a moment's notice, to take up a fresh"
5307,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,line of thought with ardour. What it could not endure was to be left
5308,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"stranded with no theme on which to expatiate. In succeeding years, when"
5309,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,it was often my daily enjoyment to listen to Lord Cromer's desultory
5310,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"conversation, as it leaped from subject to subject, I often thought of"
5311,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the alarming way in which ""Bipontium"" had pounced upon me at the"
5312,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,dinner-table in the House of Commons.
5313,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5314,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Some years passed before I had the privilege of renewing my experience
5315,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,of that evening. It was not until after his retirement from Egypt in the
5316,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"autumn of 1907 that I saw him again, and not then for some months. He"
5317,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"returned, it will be remembered, in broken health. He used to say that"
5318,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"when King Edward VII. wrote out to Cairo, strongly pressing him to stay,"
5319,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"he had replied, in the words of Herodotus, ""I am too old, oh King, and"
5320,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,too inactive; so bid thou one of the younger men here to do these
5321,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"things."" He very soon, however, recovered elasticity of mind and body"
5322,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"when the load of office was removed from his shoulders, and ""inactive"""
5323,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,was the last epithet which could ever be applied to Lord Cromer. He
5324,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"began to attend the House of Lords, but, like a wise man, he was in no"
5325,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,hurry to speak there till he had grown accustomed to the tone of the
5326,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"place. His earliest utterance (I may note the date, February 6th, 1908)"
5327,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,we listened to with equal respect and curiosity; this was a new element
5328,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,from which much enjoyment might be expected.
5329,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5330,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"This maiden speech was not long, but it produced a very happy"
5331,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"impression. The subject was the Anglo-Russian Convention, of which the"
5332,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"orator cordially approved, and I recall that a certain sensation was"
5333,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,caused by Lord Cromer's dwelling on the dangers of the Pan-Islamite
5334,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,intrigues in Egypt. This is the sort of thing that the House of Lords
5335,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"enjoys--a man of special knowledge speaking, almost confidentially, of"
5336,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,matters within his professional competency. During that year and the
5337,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,next Lord Cromer spoke with increasing frequency. There were great
5338,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,differences of opinion with regard to his efficiency in Parliament. I
5339,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,may acknowledge that I was not an unmeasured admirer of his oratory.
5340,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"When he rose from his seat on the Cross-bench, and advanced towards the"
5341,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"table, with a fine gesture of his leonine head, sympathy was always"
5342,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"mingled with respect. His independence and his honesty were patent, and"
5343,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,his slight air of authority satisfactory. His public voice was not
5344,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"unpleasing, but when he was tired it became a little veiled, and he had"
5345,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,the sad trick of dropping it at the end of his sentences. I confess that
5346,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"I sometimes found it difficult to follow what he was saying, and I do"
5347,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,not think that he understood how to fill a large space with his voice.
5348,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,He spoke as a man accustomed to wind up the debates of a council sitting
5349,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"round a table, rather than as a senator addressing the benches of"
5350,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Parliament.
5351,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5352,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"He was interested in the art of eloquence, and fond of criticising in"
5353,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,private the methods of other speakers. He had a poor opinion of much
5354,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"studied oratory, and used to declare that no one had ever convinced him"
5355,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,by merely felicitous diction. Perhaps he did not sufficiently realise
5356,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,that his own strength of purpose offered rather a granitic surface to
5357,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"persuasion. But no doubt he was right in saying that, coming as he did"
5358,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"from the florid East, he found English eloquence more plain and"
5359,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,businesslike than he left it. He used to declare that he never spoke
5360,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"impromptu if he could possibly help doing so, and he made great fun of"
5361,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the statesmen who say, ""Little did I think when I came down to this"
5362,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"House to-day that I should be called upon to speak,"" and then pour out"
5363,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,by heart a Corinthian discourse. Lord Cromer always openly and frankly
5364,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"prepared his speeches, and I have seen him entranced in the process. As"
5365,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"he always had a classical reference for everything he did, he was in the"
5366,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"habit of mentioning that Demosthenes also was unwilling to ""put his"
5367,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"faculty at the mercy of Fortune."""
5368,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5369,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"He became an habitual attendant at the House of Lords, and, while it was"
5370,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"sitting, he usually appeared in the Library about an hour before the"
5371,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"House met. He took a very lively interest in what was going on,"
5372,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"examining new books, and making a thousand suggestions. If the Lords'"
5373,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Library contains to-day one of the most complete collections of Latin
5374,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and Greek literature in the country, this is largely due to the zeal of"
5375,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Lord Cromer, who was always egging me on to the purchase of fresh"
5376,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"rarities. He was indefatigable in kindness, sending me booksellers'"
5377,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"catalogues in which curious texts were recorded, and scouring even Paris"
5378,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,and Leipzig in our behalf. When I entered into this sport so heartily as
5379,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"to provide the Greek and Latin Fathers also for their Lordships, Lord"
5380,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Cromer became unsympathetic. He had no interest whatever in Origen or
5381,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Tertullian, and I think it rather annoyed him to recall that several of"
5382,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,these oracles of the early Church had written in Greek. Nothing in
5383,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,history or philosophy or poetry which the ancient world had handed down
5384,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"to us came amiss to Lord Cromer, but I think he considered it rather"
5385,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,impertinent of the Fathers to have presumed to use the language of
5386,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Attica. He had not an ecclesiastical mind.
5387,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5388,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Lord Cromer's familiar preoccupation with the classics was a point in
5389,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,his mental habits which deserves particular attention. I have always
5390,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"supposed that he inherited it from his mother, the Hon. Mrs. Baring, who"
5391,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,was a Windham. She was a woman of learning; and she is said to have
5392,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,discomfited Sir William Harcourt at a dinner-table by quoting Lucan in
5393,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,direct disproof of a statement about the Druids which he had been rash
5394,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,enough to advance. She sang the odes of Anacreon to her son in his
5395,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"infancy, and we may conjecture that she sowed in his bosom the seeds of"
5396,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,his love of antiquity. Lord Cromer made no pretension to be what is
5397,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"called an ""exact"" scholar, but I think it is a mistake to say, as has"
5398,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"been alleged, that he did not take up the study of Latin and Greek until"
5399,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,middle life. It is true that he enjoyed no species of university
5400,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"training, but passed from Woolwich straight into the diplomatic service."
5401,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"In 1861, at the age of twenty, he was appointed A.D.C. to Sir Henry"
5402,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Storks in the Ionian Islands, and I believe that one of the first things"
5403,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,he did was to look about for an instructor in ancient Greek. He found
5404,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"one in a certain Levantine in Corfu, whose name was Romano, and their"
5405,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,studies opened with the odes of Anacreon. Whether this was a
5406,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"coincidence, or a compliment to Mrs. Baring, I do not know. This is a"
5407,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,rather different account from what Lord Cromer gave in the preface to
5408,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"his _Paraphrases_, but I report it on his own later authority."
5409,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5410,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"If his scholarship was not professorial, it was at least founded upon a"
5411,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,genuine and enduring love of the ancient world. I suppose that for fifty
5412,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"years, after the episode in Corfu, however busy he was, however immersed"
5413,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"in Imperial policy, he rarely spent a day without some communing with"
5414,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"antiquity. He read Latin, and still more Greek, not in the spirit of a"
5415,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"pedant or a pedagogue, but genuinely for pleasure and refreshment. He"
5416,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"had no vanity about it, and if he had any doubt as to the meaning of a"
5417,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"passage he would ""consult the crib,"" as he used to say. We may"
5418,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,conjecture further that he did not allow his curiosity to be balked by
5419,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the barrier of a hopelessly obscure passage, but leaped over it, and"
5420,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"went on. He always came back to Homer, whom he loved more than any other"
5421,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"writer of the world, and particularly to the _Iliad_, which I think he"
5422,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"knew nearly by heart. But he did not, as some pundits consider dignified"
5423,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and necessary, confine himself to the reading of the principal classics"
5424,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"in order to preserve a pure taste. On the contrary, Lord Cromer,"
5425,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"especially towards the close of his life, pushed up into all the byways"
5426,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,of the Silver Age. As he invariably talked about the books he happened
5427,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"to be reading, it was easy to trace his footsteps. Eight or nine years"
5428,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"ago he had a sudden passion for Empedocles, whose fragments he had found"
5429,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"collected and translated by Mr. Leonard, an American. Lord Cromer used"
5430,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"to march into the Library, and greet me by calling out, ""Do you know?"
5431,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Empedocles says"" something or other, probably some parallelism with a"
5432,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"modern phrase, the detection of which always particularly amused Lord"
5433,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Cromer.
5434,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5435,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"In 1908 he took a fancy to Theognis, whose works I procured for him at"
5436,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the House of Lords, since he happened not to possess that writer at 36"
5437,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Wimpole Street. He would settle himself in an armchair in the
5438,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"smoking-room, his eyes close to the book, and plunge into those dark"
5439,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,waters of the gnomic elegist. He loved maxims and the expression of
5440,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"principles, and above all, as I have said, the discovery of identities"
5441,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,of thought between the modern and the ancient world. He was delighted
5442,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,when he found in Theognis the proverb about having an ox on the tongue.
5443,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"I suppose this was quite well known to the learned, but the charm of the"
5444,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,matter for Lord Cromer was that he was not deterred by any fear of
5445,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"academic criticism, and found out these things for himself. He read"
5446,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Theognis as other people read Rudyard Kipling, for stimulus and"
5447,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"pleasure. He swept merely ""scholarly"" questions aside. He read his"
5448,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"_Iliad_ like a love-letter, but he was bored to death by discussions"
5449,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,about the authorship of the Homeric epics.
5450,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5451,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"In one matter, the serene good sense which was so prominently"
5452,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,characteristic of Lord Cromer tinged his attitude towards the classics.
5453,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"He was not at all like Thomas Love Peacock, who entreated his friends to"
5454,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,desist from mentioning anything that had happened in the world for the
5455,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"last 2,000 years. On the contrary, Lord Cromer was always bent on"
5456,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,binding the old and the new together. It was very noticeable in his
5457,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,conversation that he was fond of setting classic instances side by side
5458,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"with modern ones. If books dealt with this parallelism, they exercised a"
5459,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,charm over Lord Cramer's imagination which may sometimes have led him a
5460,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,little astray about their positive value. I recall a moment when he was
5461,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,completely under the sway of M. Ferrero's _Greatness and Decline of
5462,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Rome_, largely because of the pertinacity with which the Italian"
5463,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,historian compares Roman institutions with modern social arrangements.
5464,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,It was interesting to the great retired proconsul to discover that
5465,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Augustus ""considered that in the majority of cases subject peoples had"
5466,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"to be governed through their own national institutions."" It is scarcely"
5467,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"necessary to point out that these analogies form the basis of what is,"
5468,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"perhaps, Lord Cromer's most important late essay, his _Ancient and"
5469,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Modern Imperialism_.
5470,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5471,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"In a practical administration of India and Egypt, those oceans of"
5472,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"unplumbed antiquity, the ordinary British official has neither time nor"
5473,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,taste to do more than skim the surface of momentary experience. But Lord
5474,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Cromer had always been acutely aware of the mystery of the East, and"
5475,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,always looked back into the past with deep curiosity. Sometimes the
5476,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"modern life in Egypt, exciting as it was, almost seemed to him a"
5477,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,phantasmagoria dancing across the real world of Rameses. This tendency
5478,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,of thought coloured one branch of his reading; he could not bear to miss
5479,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,a book which threw any light on the social and political manners of
5480,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,antiquity. Works like Fowler's _Social Life at Rome_ or Marquardt's _Le
5481,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Culte chez les Romains_ thrilled him with excitement and animated his
5482,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"conversation for days. He wanted, above all things, to realise how the"
5483,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"ancients lived and what, feelings actuated their behaviour. On one"
5484,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"occasion, in a fit of gaiety, I ventured to tell him that he reminded me"
5485,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"of Mrs. Blimber (in _Dombey and Son_), who could have died contented had"
5486,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"she visited Cicero in his retirement at beautiful Tusculum. ""Well!"""
5487,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"replied Lord Cromer, laughing, ""and a very delightful visit that would"
5488,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"be."""
5489,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5490,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"In the admirable appreciation contributed to the _Times_ by ""C."" (our"
5491,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"other proconsular ""C.""!) it was remarked that the ""quality of mental"
5492,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"balance is visible in all that Lord Cromer wrote, whether, in his"
5493,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"official despatches, his published books, or his private"
5494,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"correspondence."" It was audible, too, in his delightful conversation,"
5495,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"which was vivid, active, and yet never oppressive. He spoke with the"
5496,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"firm accent of one accustomed to govern, but never dictatorially. His"
5497,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"voice was a very agreeable one, supple and various in its tones, neither"
5498,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,loud nor low. Although he had formed the life-long habit of expressing
5499,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"his opinions with directness, he never imposed them unfairly, or took"
5500,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"advantage of his authority. On the contrary, there was something"
5501,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,extremely winning in his eagerness to hear the reply of his
5502,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"interlocutor. ""Well, there's a great deal in that,"" he would graciously"
5503,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and cordially say, and proceed to give the opposing statement what"
5504,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"benefit he thought it deserved. He could be very trenchant, but I do not"
5505,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,think that any one whom he had advanced to the privilege of his
5506,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,confidence can remember that he was so to a friend.
5507,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5508,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"The attitude of Lord Cromer to life and letters--I speak, of course,"
5509,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,only of what I saw in the years of his retirement from office--was not
5510,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,exactly representative of our own or even of the last century. He would
5511,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"have been at home in the fourth quarter of the eighteenth century,"
5512,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,before the French Revolution. I judge him to have been born with an
5513,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"inflexible and commanding character, which in the person of many men"
5514,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,exposed to such dangerous successes as he enjoyed might have degenerated
5515,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"into tyranny. On Lord Cromer, on the other hand, time produced a"
5516,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,humanising and mellowing effect. It may very well prove that he has
5517,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"stamped his mark on the East of the twentieth century, as Turgot did his"
5518,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,on the West of the nineteenth century; but without straying into the
5519,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,perilous fields of prophecy we are safe in recording the impression that
5520,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Lord Cromer was not altogether a man of to-day; he looked forward and he
5521,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,looked backward. Probably the nearest counterpart to his manner of mind
5522,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,and conversation may be found in the circle of whom we read in the
5523,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,_Diary_ of Fanny Burney. We can conceive Lord Cromer leaning against the
5524,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Committee Box in earnest conversation with Mr. Windham and Mr. Burke at
5525,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Warren Hastings' trial. We can restore the half-disdainful gesture with
5526,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"which he would drop an epigram (""from the Greek"") into the Bath Easton"
5527,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Vase. His politeness and precision, his classical quotations, his"
5528,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"humour, his predilections in literature and art, were those of the inner"
5529,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"circle of Whigs nearly a century and a half ago, and I imagine that"
5530,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,their talk was very much like his.
5531,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5532,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"He was fond of repeating Bagehot's description of the Whigs, and it"
5533,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,seems to me to apply so exactly to himself that I will quote part of
5534,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,it:--
5535,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5536,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"""Perhaps as long as there has been a political history in this"
5537,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"country there have been certain men of a cool, moderate, resolute"
5538,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"firmness, not gifted with high imagination, little prone to"
5539,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"enthusiastic sentiment, heedless of large theories and"
5540,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"speculations, careless of dreamy scepticism, with a clear view of"
5541,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the next step, and a wise intention to take it; a strong conviction"
5542,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"that the elements of knowledge are true, and a steady belief that"
5543,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the present would, can, and should be quietly improved."""
5544,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5545,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"In a full analysis of Lord Cromer's character, I think that every clause"
5546,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,of this description might be expanded with illustrations. In the
5547,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"intellectual domain, Bagehot's words, ""little prone to enthusiastic"
5548,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"sentiment,"" seem made to fit Lord Cromer's detachment from all the"
5549,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,tendencies of romanticism. His literary tastes were highly developed
5550,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and eagerly indulged, but they were all in their essence"
5551,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"pre-Revolutionary. Those who are familiar with a book once famous, the"
5552,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"_Diary of a Lover of Literature_ of Thomas Green, written down to the"
5553,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"very end of the eighteenth century, have in their hands a volume in"
5554,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,which the very accents of Lord Cromer may seem to be heard. Isaac
5555,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,d'Israeli said that Green had humbled all modern authors in the dust;
5556,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Lord Cromer had a short way with many of the writers most fashionable at
5557,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,this moment. When he was most occupied with the resuscitations of
5558,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"ancient manners, of which I have already spoken, I found to my surprise"
5559,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"that he had never read _Marius the Epicurean_. I recommended it to him,"
5560,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and with his usual instant response to suggestion, he got it at once and"
5561,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"began reading it. But I could not persuade him to share my enthusiasm,"
5562,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and, what was not like him, he did not read _Marius_ to the end. The"
5563,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,richness and complication of Pater's style annoyed him. He liked prose
5564,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"to be clear and stately; he liked it, in English, to be Addisonian. Even"
5565,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Gibbon-though he read _The Decline and Fall_ over again, very carefully,"
5566,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,so late as 1913--was not entirely to his taste. He enjoyed the limpidity
5567,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and the irony, but the sustained roll of Gibbon's antitheses vexed him a"
5568,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,little. He liked prose to be quite simple.
5569,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5570,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"In many ways, Lord Cromer, during those long and desultory conversations"
5571,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"about literature which will be so perennial a delight to look back upon,"
5572,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,betrayed his constitutional detestation of the Romantic attitude. He
5573,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"believed himself to be perfectly catholic in his tastes, and resented"
5574,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the charge of prejudice. But he was, in fact, irritated by the excesses"
5575,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,and obscurities of much that is fashionable to-day in the world of
5576,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"letters, and he refused his tribute of incense to several popular idols."
5577,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"He thought that, during the course of the nineteenth century, German"
5578,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,influences had seriously perturbed the balance of taste in Europe. I do
5579,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"not know that Lord Cromer had pursued these impressions very far, or"
5580,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,that he had formed any conscious theory with regard to them. But he was
5581,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"very ""eighteenth century"" in his suspicion of enthusiasm, and I always"
5582,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,found him amusingly impervious to ideas of a visionary or mystical
5583,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,order. It was impossible that so intelligent and omnivorous a reader as
5584,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"he should not be drawn to the pathetic figure of Pascal, but he was"
5585,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"puzzled by him. He described him as ""manifestly a man full of contrasts,"
5586,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"difficult to understand, and as many-sided as Odysseus."" On another"
5587,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"occasion, losing patience with Pascal, he called him ""a half-lunatic man"
5588,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"of genius."" Fénélon annoyed him still more; the spiritual experiences of"
5589,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the Archbishop of Cambrai he found ""almost incomprehensible."" His"
5590,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"surprising, but after all perfectly consistent, comment on both Fénélon"
5591,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and Pascal was, ""How much more easy Buffon is to understand!"""
5592,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5593,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,He recommended all young men who intend to take a part in politics
5594,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"carefully to study pre-Revolutionary history, and one of his objections"
5595,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,to the romantic literature of Rousseau downwards was that it did not
5596,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"help such study. It was too individualistic in its direction. It tended,"
5597,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"moreover, Lord Cromer thought, to disturb the balance of judgment, that"
5598,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"""level-headedness"" which he valued so highly, and had exercised with"
5599,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,such magnificent authority. He disliked the idea that genius involved a
5600,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"lack of sanity, or, in other words, of self-command. He regretted that"
5601,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Dryden had given general currency to this idea by his famous lines in
5602,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,_Absalom and Achitophel_:--
5603,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5604,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"""Great wits are sure to madness near allied,"
5605,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"And thin partitions do their bounds divide;"""
5606,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5607,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"but Lord Cromer was himself, perhaps, too ready to account by insanity"
5608,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,for every odd or confused expression in literature. He had nothing to
5609,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"say about Mazzini, whom he swept aside impatiently, except that he ""was"
5610,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"a semi-lunatic,"" and I have heard him declare of Chatterton and"
5611,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Verlaine--a strange couple--that they were a pair of madmen. He objected
5612,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"violently to Baudelaire, but I think he knew very little about that"
5613,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,poet's works.
5614,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5615,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"If I mention these things, it is because they seem to be necessary to"
5616,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,give human character to any sketch of the mind of Lord Cromer. He
5617,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"himself hated mere eulogy, which he said had ruined most of the"
5618,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,biographies of the world. The official lives of Disraeli and Gladstone
5619,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"did not escape a measure of his blame in this respect, and it will be"
5620,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,recalled that resentment against what he thought a shadowless portrait
5621,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"led to his own very vivacious paper on Disraeli, which he afterwards"
5622,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"issued as a pamphlet. He was an avid reader of memoirs, and of political"
5623,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"memoirs in particular, but he almost always passed upon them the same"
5624,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"criticism--that they were too _public_. ""I don't want Mr. ----,"" he"
5625,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"would say, ""to tell me what I can learn for myself by turning up the"
5626,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,file of the _Morning Post_. I want him to tell me what I can't find out
5627,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,elsewhere. And he need not be so very much afraid of hinting that his
5628,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"hero had faults, for if he had not had defects we should never have"
5629,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"heard of his qualities. We are none of us perfect, and we don't want a"
5630,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"priggish biographer to pretend that we are."" He was speaking here mainly"
5631,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,of political matters; but Lord Cromer's training and experience had a
5632,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,strong bearing on his literary tastes. With him politics reacted on
5633,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"literature, although he liked to fancy that he kept them wholly apart."
5634,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5635,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,No doubt a selection from his correspondence will one day be given to
5636,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the world, for he was a vivid, copious, and daring letter-writer. I"
5637,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,suppose that he wrote to each of his friends mainly on the subject which
5638,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"absorbed that friend most, and as his own range of sympathies and"
5639,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"interests was very wide, it is probable that his letters will prove"
5640,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,excellent general reading. As in so many other of the departments of
5641,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"life, Lord Cromer did not think letter-writing a matter to be lightly"
5642,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,regarded or approached without responsibility. He said:--
5643,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5644,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"""There are two habits which I have contracted, and which I have"
5645,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"endeavoured to pass on to my children, as I have found them useful."
5646,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"One is to shut the door after me when I leave the room, and the"
5647,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,other is always to affix the day of the month and the year to every
5648,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"document, however unimportant, that I sign. I have received numbers"
5649,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"of letters, not only from women, one of whose numerous privileges"
5650,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"it is to be vague, but also from men in high official positions,"
5651,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,dated with the day of the week only. When the document is
5652,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"important, such a proceeding is a fraud on posterity."""
5653,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5654,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"He often, both in conversation and in letters, took up one of his"
5655,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"favourite classic tags, and wove a shrewd modern reflection round it."
5656,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"For instance, a couple of years before the war, a phrase of Aristotle"
5657,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"recommending a ruthless egotism in the conduct of war, led him to say:--"
5658,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5659,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"""I think that at times almost every modern nation has acted on this"
5660,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"principle, though they gloss it over with fine words. Its principal"

5662,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5663,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"And, in connection with the axiom of Thucydides that war educates"
5664,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"through violence, he wrote, about the same time:--"

5666,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"""The Germans, who, in spite of their culture, preserve a strain of"
5667,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"barbarism in their characters, are the modern representatives of"
5668,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,this view. There is just this amount of truth in it--that at the
5669,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"cost of undue and appalling sacrifices, war brings out certain"
5670,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"fine qualities in individuals, and sometimes in nations."""
5671,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5672,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"This may, surely, be taken as a direct prophecy of the magnificent"
5673,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"effort of France. Lord Cromer's reflections, thrown off in the warmth of"
5674,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"personal contact, often had a pregnant directness. For instance, how"
5675,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,good this is:--
5676,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5677,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"""The prejudice against the Boeotians was probably in a large"
5678,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"measure due to the fact that, as the late Lord Salisbury might have"
5679,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"said, they 'put their money on the wrong horse' during the Persian"
5680,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"war. So also, it may be observed, did the oracle at Delphi."""
5681,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5682,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Lord Cromer's public speeches and published writings scarcely give a
5683,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"hint of his humour, which was lambent and sometimes almost boyish. He"
5684,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"loved to be amused, and he repaid his entertainer by being amusing. I"
5685,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,suppose that after his return from Cairo he allowed this feature of his
5686,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,character a much freer run. The legend used to be that he was looked
5687,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"upon in Egypt as rather grim, and by no means to be trifled with. He was"
5688,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"not the man, we may be sure, to be funny with a Young Turk, or to crack"
5689,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"needless jokes with a recalcitrant Khedive. But retirement softened him,"
5690,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and the real nature of Lord Cromer, with its elements of geniality and"
5691,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"sportiveness, came into full play."

5693,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Eight years ago, I regret to admit, Mr. Lloyd George was not the"

5695,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Cromer was one of those who were not entirely reconciled to the
5696,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,financial projects of the new Chancellor of the Exchequer. He compared

5705,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,The strained relations between Mr. Lloyd George and the House of Lords
5706,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,inspired Lord Cromer with a really delightful parallel from Dryden's
5707,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"_Absalom and Achitophel_ (which, by the way, was one of his favourite"

5719,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,and then it was most painful to an orator to make a literary reference
5720,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"which was not taken up. Once at Sheffield, when he was urging the"
5721,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"necessity of a strong Navy upon a large public meeting, he quoted"
5722,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Swinburne's splendid lines:--

5728,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"illiterate audience, and I recollect that on one occasion, when Lord"
5729,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Cromer himself was speaking on preferential treatment for the Colonies,"
5730,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,and quoted Prior:--
5731,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,

5737,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"He was very entertaining about the oddities of his life in the East, and"

5747,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,We have been told that he who blows through bronze may breathe through
5748,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,silver. The severe preoccupations of Lord Cromer's public life did not
5749,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"prevent him from sedulously cultivating the art of verse. In 1903,"
5750,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"before his retirement from Egypt, he published a volume of _Paraphrases"
5751,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and Translations from the Greek_, in the preparation or selection of"
5752,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,which I believe that he enjoyed the advice of Mr. Mackail. It was rather
5753,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"unlucky that, with a view to propitiate the angry critics, Lord Cromer"
5754,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,prefixed to this little book a preface needlessly modest. He had no
5755,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,cause to apologise so deeply for exercises which were both elegant and
5756,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"learned. It is a curious fact that, in this collection of paraphrases,"
5757,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,the translator did not touch the Attic authors whom he knew so well--he
5758,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,used to copy out pages of Æschylus and Sophocles in his loose Greek
5759,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"script, with notes of his own--but dealt entirely with lyric and"
5760,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,epigrammatic poets of the Alexandrian age. Perhaps it seemed to him less
5761,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,daring to touch them than to affront Æschylus. He was not quite sure
5762,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"about these verses of his; he liked them, and then he was afraid that"
5763,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"they were unworthy of the original. Out in Cairo it was so difficult, he"

5787,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"After his settlement in London, Mr. T.E. Page sent him a book, called"
5788,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"_Between Whiles_, of English verse translated into Latin and Greek. Lord"
5789,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Cromer was delighted with this, and the desire to write in metre"
5790,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"returned to him. He used to send his friends, in letters, little"
5791,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"triolets and epigrams, generally in English, but sometimes in Greek. But"
5792,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"he was more ambitious than this. So lately as February 1911, during the"
5793,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"course of one of our long conversations upon literature, he asked me to"
5794,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,suggest a task of translation on which he could engage. It was just the
5795,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,moment when he was particularly busy with Constitutional Free Trade and
5796,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"Woman Suffrage and other public topics, but that made no difference. It"
5797,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,had always seemed to me that he had been most happy in his versions of
5798,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the Bucolic poets, and so I urged him to continue his translations by"
5799,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"attempting the _Europa_ of Moschus. He looked at it, and pronounced it"
5800,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,unattractive. I was therefore not a little surprised to receive a

5824,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5825,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Lord Cromer was fond of saying that he considered the main beauty of
5826,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Greek poetry to reside in its simplicity. In all his verses he aimed at
5827,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,limpidity and ease. He praised the Greek poets for not rhapsodising
5828,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"about the beauties of nature, and this was very characteristic of his"
5829,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"own eighteenth-century habit of mind. His general attitude to poetry,"
5830,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"which he read incessantly and in four languages, was a little difficult"
5831,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"to define. He was ready to give lists of his life-long prime favourites,"
5832,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"and, as was very natural, these differed from time to time. But one list"
5833,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"of the books he had ""read more frequently than any other"" consisted of"
5834,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the _Iliad_, the Book of Job, _Tristram Shandy_, and _Pickwick_, to"
5835,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,which he added _Lycidas_ and the Tenth Satire of Juvenal. It would
5836,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,require a good deal of ingenuity to bring these six masterpieces into
5837,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,line. He was consistent in declaring that the 28th chapter of Job was
5838,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"""the finest bit of poetry ever written."""
5839,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5840,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,He was violently carried away in 1912 by reading Mr. Livingstone's book
5841,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,on _The Greek Genius_. It made him a little regret the pains he had
5842,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"expended on the Hymns of Callimachus and the Bucolics of Theocritus,"
5843,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,and he thought that perhaps he ought to have confined himself to the
5844,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"severer and earlier classics. But surely he had followed his instinct,"
5845,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,and it would have been a pity if he had narrowed his range. It was the
5846,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"modernness of the Alexandrian authors, and perhaps their Egyptian"
5847,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"flavour, which had justly attracted him. He did not care very much for"
5848,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,an antiquity which he could not revivify for his own vision. I urged him
5849,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"to read a book which had fascinated me, _The Religion of Numa_, by a"
5850,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"learned American, the late Mr. Jesse Carter. Lord Cromer read it with"
5851,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"respect, but he admitted that those earliest Roman ages were too remote"
5852,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,and cold for him.
5853,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,
5854,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,Lord Cromer was very much annoyed with Napoleon for having laid it down
5855,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"that _après soixante ans, un homme ne vaut rien_. The rash dictum had"
5856,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"certainly no application to himself. It is true that, under the strain"
5857,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"of the long tropical years, his bodily health declined as he approached"
5858,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"the age of sixty. But his mental activity, his marvellous receptivity,"
5859,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"were not merely maintained, but seemed steadily to advance. He continued"
5860,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"to be consumed by that lust for knowledge, _libido sciendi_, which he"
5861,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"admired in the ancient Greeks. When the physicians forbade him, four"
5862,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"years ago, to expend his failing strength any longer on political and"
5863,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"social propaganda, instead of retiring, as most men of his age would"
5864,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"have done, to dream in the recesses of his library, he plunged with"
5865,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,renewed ardour into the one occupation still permitted to him:
5866,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,literature. The accident of his publishing a criticism which excited
5867,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"wide popular attention led to his becoming, when past his seventieth"
5868,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"birthday, a ""regular reviewer"" for the _Spectator_, where the very"
5869,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"frequent papers signed ""C."" became a prominent feature. Those articles"
5870,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"were, perhaps, most remarkable for the light they threw on the writer's"
5871,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"own temperament, on his insatiable desire for knowledge. Lord Cromer's"
5872,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"curiosity in all intellectual directions was, to the last, like that of"
5873,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,a young man beginning his mental career; and when he adopted the
5874,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"position, so uncommon in a man of his experience and authority, of a"
5875,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,"reviewer of current books, it was because he wished to share with others"
5876,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,the excitement he himself enjoyed in the tapping of fresh sources of
5877,LORD CROMER AS A MAN OF LETTERS,information.

5883,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
5884,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,The publication of Lord Redesdale's _Memories_--which was one of the
5885,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,most successful autobiographies of recent times--familiarised thousands
5886,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"of readers with the principal adventures of a very remarkable man, but,"
5887,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"when all was said and done, left an incomplete impression of his taste"
5888,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,and occupations on the minds of those who were not familiar with his
5889,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,earlier writings. His literary career had been a very irregular one. He
5890,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"took up literature rather late, and produced a book that has become a"
5891,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,classic--_Tales of Old Japan_. He did not immediately pursue this
5892,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"success, but became involved in public activities of many kinds, which"
5893,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,distracted his attention. In his sixtieth year he brought out _The
5894,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Bamboo Garden_, and from that time--until, in his eightieth year, he"
5895,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,died in full intellectual energy--he constantly devoted himself to the
5896,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"art of writing. His zeal, his ambition, were wonderful; but it was"
5897,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,impossible to overlook the disadvantage from which that ambition and
5898,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,that zeal suffered in the fact that for the first sixty years of his
5899,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,life the writer had cultivated the art but casually and sporadically. He
5900,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"retained, in spite of all the labour which he expended, a certain"
5901,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"stiffness, an air of the amateur, of which he himself was always acutely"
5902,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,conscious.
5903,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
5904,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,This did not interfere with the direct and sincere appeal made to
5905,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"general attention by the 1915 _Memories_, a book so full of geniality"
5906,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"and variety, so independent in its judgments and so winning in its"
5907,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"ingenuousness, that its wider popularity could be the object of no"
5908,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"surprise. But, to those who knew Lord Redesdale intimately, it must"
5909,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,always appear that his autobiography fails to explain him from what we
5910,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,may call the subjective point of view. It tells us of his adventures and
5911,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"his friendships, of the strange lands he visited and of the unexpected"
5912,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"confidences he received, but it does not reveal very distinctly the"
5913,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,character of the writer. There is far more of his intellectual
5914,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"constitution, of his personal tastes and mental habits, in the volume of"
5915,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"essays of 1912, called _A Tragedy in Stone_, but even here much is left"
5916,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,unsaid and even unsuggested.
5917,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
5918,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,Perhaps the most remarkable fact about Lord Redesdale was the redundant
5919,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"vitality of his character. His nature swarmed with life, like a drop of"
5920,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,pond-water under a microscope. There cannot be found room in any one
5921,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"nature for all the qualities, and what he lacked in some degree was"
5922,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,concentration. But very few men who have lived in our complicated age
5923,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"have done well in so many directions as he, or, aiming widely, have"
5924,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,failed in so few. He shrank from no labour and hesitated before no
5925,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"difficulty, but pushed on with an extraordinary energy along many"
5926,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,various lines of activity. But the two lines in which he most desired
5927,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"and most determined to excel, gardening and authorship, are scarcely to"
5928,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"be discerned, except below the surface, in his _Memories_. Next to his"
5929,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"books, what he regarded with most satisfaction was his wonderful garden"
5930,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"at Batsford, and of this there is scarcely a word of record in the"
5931,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"autobiography. He had always intended to celebrate this garden, and when"
5932,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,he was preparing to return to Batsford in 1915 he wrote to me that he
5933,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"was going to write an _Apologia pro Horto meo_, as long before he had"
5934,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,composed one _pro Banibusis meis_. A book which should combine with the
5935,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,freest fancies of his intellect a picture of the exotic groves of
5936,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,Batsford was what was required to round off Lord Redesdale's literary
5937,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,adventures. It will be seen that he very nearly succeeded in thus
5938,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,setting the top-stone on his literary edifice.
5939,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
5940,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"One reason, perhaps, why Batsford, which was ever present to his"
5941,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"thoughts, is so very slightly and vaguely mentioned in Lord Redesdale's"
5942,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"_Memories_, may be the fact that from 1910 onwards he was not living in"
5943,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"it himself, and that it was irksome to him to magnify in print"
5944,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,horticultural beauties which were for the time being in the possession
5945,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"of others. The outbreak of the war, in which all his five sons were"
5946,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"instantly engaged, was the earliest of a series of changes which"
5947,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,completely altered the surface of Lord Redesdale's life. Batsford came
5948,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"once more into his personal occupation, and at the same time it became"
5949,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,convenient to give up his London house in Kensington Court. Many things
5950,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,combined to transform his life in the early summer of 1915. His eldest
5951,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"son, Major the Hon. Clement Mitford, after brilliantly distinguishing"
5952,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"himself in battle, was received by the King and decorated, to the"
5953,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,rapturous exultation of his father. Major Mitford returned to the French
5954,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"front, only to fall on May 13th, 1915."
5955,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
5956,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"At this time I was seeing Lord Redesdale very frequently, and I could"
5957,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,not but be struck by the effect of this blow upon his temperament. After
5958,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"the first shock of sorrow, I observed in him the determination not to"
5959,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,allow himself to be crushed. His dominant vitality asserted itself
5960,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"almost with violence, and he seemed to clench his tooth in defiance of"
5961,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,the assault on his individuality. It required on the part of so old a
5962,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"man no little fortitude, for it is easier to bear a great and heroic"
5963,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,bereavement than to resist the wearing vexation of seeing one's system
5964,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,of daily occupation crumbling away. Lord Redesdale was pleased to be
5965,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"going again to Batsford, which had supplied him in years past with so"
5966,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"much sumptuous and varied entertainment, but it was a matter of alarm"
5967,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"with him to give up all, or almost all, the various ties with London"
5968,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,which had meant so much to his vividly social nature.
5969,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
5970,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Meanwhile, during the early months of 1915 in London, he had plenty of"
5971,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"employment in finishing and revising his _Memories_, which it had taken"
5972,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,him two years to write. This was an occupation which bridged over the
5973,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"horrid chasm between his old active life in London, with its thousand"
5974,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"interests, and the uncertain and partly dreaded prospect of exile in the"
5975,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"bamboo-gardens of a remote corner of Gloucestershire, where he foresaw"
5976,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,that deafness must needs exclude him from the old activities of local
5977,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,life.
5978,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
5979,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"He finished revising the manuscript of his _Memories_ in July, and then"
5980,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"went down, while the actual transference of his home was taking place,"
5981,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"to the Royal Yacht Squadron Castle, Cowes, where he had been accustomed"
5982,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"to spend some of the most enjoyable hours of his life. But this scene,"
5983,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"habitually thronged with people, and palpitating with gaiety, in the"
5984,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"midst of which Lord Redesdale found himself so singularly at home, was"
5985,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"now, more than perhaps any other haunt of the English sportsman, in"
5986,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"complete eclipse. The weather was lovely, but there were no yachts, no"
5987,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"old chums, no charming ladies. ""It is very dull,"" he wrote; ""the sole"
5988,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"inhabitant of the Club besides myself was Lord Falkland, and now he is"
5989,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"gone."" In these conditions Lord Redesdale became suddenly conscious that"
5990,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"the activity of the last two or three years was over, that the aspect of"
5991,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"his world had changed, and that he was in danger of losing that hold"
5992,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,upon life to which he so resolutely clung. In conditions of this kind he
5993,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"always turned to seek for something mentally ""craggy,"" as Byron said,"
5994,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,and at Cowes he wonderfully found the writings of Nietzsche. The result
5995,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"is described in a remarkable letter to myself (July 28th, 1915), which"
5996,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,I quote because it marks the earliest stage in the composition of his
5997,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,last unfinished book:--
5998,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
5999,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"""I have been trying to occupy myself with Nietzsche, on the theory"
6000,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,that there must be something great about a man who exercised the
6001,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,immense influence that he did. But I confess I am no convert to any
6002,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"of his various moods. Here and there I find gems of thought, but"
6003,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,one has to wade through a morass of blue mud to get at them. Here
6004,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,is a capital saying of his which may be new to you--in a letter to
6005,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,his friend Rohde he writes: 'Eternally we need midwives in order to
6006,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"be delivered of our thoughts,' We cannot work in solitude. 'Woe to"
6007,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,us who lack the sunlight of a friend's presence.'
6008,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6009,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"""How true that is! When I come down here, I think that with so much"
6010,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,time on my hands I shall be able to get through a pile of work. Not
6011,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,a bit of it! I find it difficult even to write a note. To me it is
6012,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,an imperative necessity to have the sympathetic counsel of a
6013,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"friend."""
6014,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6015,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,The letter continued with an impassioned appeal to his correspondent to
6016,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"find some definite intellectual work for him to undertake. ""You make me"
6017,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"dare, and that is much towards winning a game. You must sharpen my wits,"
6018,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"which are blunt enough just now."" In short, it was a cry from the island"
6019,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,of boredom to come over the water and administer first-aid.
6020,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6021,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Accordingly, I started for Cowes, and was welcomed at the pier with all"
6022,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,my host's habitual and vivacious hospitality. Scarcely were we seated in
6023,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"our wicker-chairs in face of the Solent, not twinkling as usual with"
6024,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"pleasure-sails, but sinister with strange instruments of warfare, than"
6025,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"he began the attack. ""What am I to do with myself?"" was the instant"
6026,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"question; ""what means can I find of occupying this dreadful void of"
6027,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"leisure?"" To which the obvious reply was: ""First of all, you must"
6028,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"exhibit to me the famous attractions of Cowes!"" ""There are none,"" he"
6029,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"replied in comic despair, but we presently invented some, and my visit,"
6030,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"which extended over several radiant days of a perfect August, was"
6031,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"diversified with walks and excursions by land and water, in which my"
6032,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,companion was as active and as ardent as though he had been nineteen
6033,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"instead of seventy-nine. In a suit picturesquely marine, with his"
6034,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"beautiful silver hair escaping from a jaunty yachting cap, he was the"
6035,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,last expression of vivacity and gaiety.
6036,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6037,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"The question of his intellectual occupation in the future came, however,"
6038,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,incessantly to the front; and our long talks in the strange and uncanny
6039,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,solitude of the Royal Yacht Squadron Castle always came to this: What
6040,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,task was he to take up next? His large autobiography was now coming back
6041,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"to him from the printers in packets of proof, with which he was closeted"
6042,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,night and morning; and I suggested that while this was going on there
6043,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,was no need for him to think about future enterprises. To tell the
6044,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"truth, I had regarded the _Memories_ as likely to be the final labour of"
6045,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,Lord Redesdale's busy life. It seemed to me that at his advanced age he
6046,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,might now well withdraw into dignified repose. I even hinted so much in
6047,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"terms as delicate as I could make them, but the suggestion was not well"
6048,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,received. I became conscious that there was nothing he was so little
6049,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"prepared to welcome as ""repose""; that, in fact, the terror which"
6050,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,possessed him was precisely the dread of having to withdraw from the
6051,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"stage of life. His deafness, which now began to be excessive, closed to"
6052,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"his eager spirit so many of the avenues of experience, that he was more"
6053,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"than ever anxious to keep clear those that remained to him, and of"
6054,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"these, literary expression came to be almost the only one left. In the"
6055,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,absence of a definite task his path in this direction led through
6056,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,darkness.
6057,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6058,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,But it was not until after several suggestions and many conversations
6059,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,that light was found. The friend so pressingly appealed to returned to
6060,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"London, where he was stern in rejecting several projects, hotly flung at"
6061,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,his head and then coldly abandoned. A study of the Empress Maria
6062,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Theresa, suggested by a feverish perusal of Pechler, was the latest and"
6063,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,least attractive of these. Lord Redesdale then frankly demanded that a
6064,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"subject should be found for him. ""You have brought this upon yourself,"""
6065,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"he said, ""by encouraging me to write."" What might prove the scheme of a"
6066,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"very pleasant book then occurred to me, and I suggested to the fiery and"
6067,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"impatient author, who had by this time retired for good to Batsford,"
6068,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,that he should compose a volume of essays dealing with things in
6069,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"general, but bound together by a constantly repeated reference to his"
6070,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,wild garden of bamboos and the Buddha in his secret grove. The author
6071,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,was to suppose himself seated with a friend on the terrace at the top of
6072,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"the garden, and to let the idea of the bamboo run through the whole"
6073,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,tissue of reflections and reminiscences like an emerald thread. Lord
6074,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Redesdale was enchanted, and the idea took fire at once. He replied:--"
6075,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6076,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"""You are Orpheus, with his lute moving the rocks and stones! I"
6077,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"shall work all my conceits into your plan, and am now proceeding to"
6078,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,my garden shrine to meditate on it. I will try to make a picture of
6079,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"the VELUVANA, the bamboo-garden which was the first Vikara or"
6080,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"monastery of Buddha and his disciples. There I will sit, and,"
6081,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"looking on the great statue of Buddha in meditation, I shall begin"
6082,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,to arrange all sorts of wild imaginings which may come into my
6083,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"crazy brain."""
6084,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6085,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"In this way was started the book, of which, alas! only such fragments"
6086,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,were composed as form the earlier part of the volume published after his
6087,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"death. It is, however, right to point out that for the too-brief"
6088,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,remainder of his life Lord Redesdale was eagerly set on the scheme of
6089,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,which a hint has just been given. The _Veluvana_ was to be the crowning
6090,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"production of his literary life, and it was to sum up the wisdom of the"
6091,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"East and the gaiety of the West. He spoke of it incessantly, in letters"
6092,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"and conversation. ""That will do to go into _Veluvana_,"" was his cry when"
6093,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"he met with anything rare or strange. For instance, on September 15th,"
6094,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"1915, he wrote to me:--"
6095,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6096,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"""To-day, all of a sudden I was struck by the idea that plants,"
6097,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"having many human qualities, may also in some degree have human"
6098,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,motives--that they are not altogether mere automata--and as I

6103,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"some of which seem never to have been noticed at all, or certainly"

6108,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"The monasteries of twelfth-century Japanese Buddhism, which he had"
6109,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"visited long before in the neighbourhood of Kioto, now recurred to his"
6110,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"memory, and he proposed to describe in what a monk of Hiyeisan differed"
6111,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,from an Indian Buddhist monk. This was a theme of extraordinary
6112,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"interest, and wholly germane to his purpose. It drove him back to his"
6113,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Japanese books, and to his friend Sir Ernest Satow's famous dictionary."

6122,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,These reveries were strictly in accordance with the spirit of
6123,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"_Veluvana_, but unfortunately what Lord Redesdale wrote in this"
6124,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,direction proved to be too slight for publication. He met with some
6125,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"expressions of extremely modern Japanese opinion which annoyed him, and"
6126,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,to which he was tempted to give more attention than they deserve. It
6127,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,began to be obvious that the enterprise was one for which great
6128,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"concentration of effort, and a certain serenity of purpose which was not"
6129,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"to be secured at will, were imperatively needed. In leaving London, he"
6130,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"was not content, and no one could have wished him to be willing, to"
6131,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,break abruptly all the cords of his past life. He was still a Trustee of
6132,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"the National Gallery, still chairman of the Marlborough Club, still"
6133,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"occupied with the administration of the Wallace Collection, and he did"
6134,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,not abate his interest in these directions. They made it necessary that
6135,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,he should come up to town every other week. This made up in some measure
6136,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,for the inevitable disappointment of finding that in Gloucestershire his
6137,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,deafness now completely cut him off from all the neighbourly duties
6138,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,which had in earlier years diversified and entertained his country life.
6139,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,He had been a great figure among the squires and farmers of the
6140,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Cotswolds, but all this was now at an end, paralysed by the hopeless"
6141,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"decay of his hearing. It grieved him, too, that he was unable to do any"
6142,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"useful war-work in the county, and he was forced to depend upon his pen"
6143,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,and his flying visits to London for refreshment. He was a remarkably
6144,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"good letter-writer, and he now demanded almost pathetically to be fed"
6145,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"with the apples of correspondence. He wrote (November 26th, 1915):--"
6146,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,

6159,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"longer hear into small dark pools full of many-coloured water-lilies,"
6160,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"his activity was like that of a boy. He had the appearance, the tastes,"
6161,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,the instincts of vigorous manhood prolonged far beyond the usual limit
6162,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"of such gifts, and yet all were marred and rendered bankrupt for him by"
6163,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"the one intolerable defect, the deafness which had by this time become"
6164,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,almost impenetrable to sound.
6165,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6166,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,Yet it seemed as though this disability actually quickened his mental
6167,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"force. With the arrival of his eightieth year, his activity and"
6168,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,curiosity of intellect were certainly rather increased than abated. He
6169,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"wrote to me from Batsford (December 28th, 1915):--"

6171,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"""I have been busy for the last two months making a close study of"

6175,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"two has appeared Hoare's Italian Dictionary, published by the"
6176,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Cambridge University Press. A much-needed book, for the previous"

6183,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,There is invention enough in Dante without all their embroidery.
6184,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,But this grubbing and grouting seems to be infectious among Dante

6186,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6187,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,He flung himself into these Italian studies with all his accustomed
6188,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"ardour. He corresponded with the eminent veteran of Dante scholarship,"
6189,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"the Honourable W.W. Vernon, whom he mentions in the passage just quoted,"
6190,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,and Mr. Vernon's letters gave him great delight. He wrote to me again:--
6191,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6192,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"""This new object in life gives me huge pleasure. Of course, I knew"
6193,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"the catch quotations in Dante, but I never before attempted to read"

6195,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6196,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Now, on the contrary, the difficulty was an attraction. He worked away"
6197,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"for hours at a time, braving the monotonies of the _Purgatorio_ without"
6198,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"flagging, but he broke down early in the _Paradiso_. He had no sympathy"
6199,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"whatever with what is mystic and spiritual, and he was extremely bored"
6200,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,by the Beatific Vision and the Rose of the Empyrean. I confess I took
6201,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"advantage of this to recall his attention to _Veluvana_, for which it"
6202,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,was no longer possible to hope that the author would collect any
6203,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,material out of Dante.
6204,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6205,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,An invitation from Cambridge to lecture there on Russian history during
6206,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,the Long Vacation of 1916 was a compliment to the value of the Russian
6207,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"chapters of his _Memories_, but it was another distraction. It took his"
6208,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"thoughts away from _Veluvana_, although he protested to me that he"
6209,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"could prepare his Cambridge address, and yet continue to marshal his"
6210,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"fancies for the book. Perhaps I doubted it, and dared to disapprove, for"
6211,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"he wrote (March 17th, 1916):--"

6213,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"""You scold me for writing too much. That is the least of my"

6220,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6221,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,He was really composing more actively than he himself realised. About
6222,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,this time he wrote:--

6224,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"""Just now I am busy trying to whitewash Lord Hertford--not the"
6225,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Marquess of Steyne, that would be impossible--but the unhappy"

6228,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Paris--all his faults exaggerated, none of his good qualities even"
6229,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,hinted at. The good British public has so long been used to look
6230,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,upon him as a minotaur that it will perhaps startle and amuse it to
6231,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"be told that he had many admirable points."""
6232,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6233,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,At the beginning of last year the aspect of Lord Redesdale was very
6234,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"remarkable. He had settled down into his life at Batsford, diversified"
6235,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,by the frequent dashes to London. His years seemed to sit upon him more
6236,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"lightly than ever. His azure eyes, his curled white head thrown back,"
6237,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"the almost jaunty carriage of his well-kept figure, were the external"
6238,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"symbols of an inner man perpetually fresh, ready for adventure and"
6239,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,delighted with the pageant of existence. He found no fault at all with
6240,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"life, save that it must leave him, and he had squared his shoulders not"
6241,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,to give way to weakness. Perhaps the only sign of weakness was just that
6242,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,visible determination to be strong. But the features of his character
6243,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"had none of those mental wrinkles, those ""rides de l'esprit,"" which"
6244,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,Montaigne describes as proper to old age. Lord Redesdale was guiltless
6245,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,of the old man's self-absorption or exclusive interest in the past. His
6246,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"curiosity and sympathy were vividly exhibited to his friends, and so, in"
6247,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"spite of his amusing violence in denouncing his own forgetfulness, was"
6248,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,his memory of passing events. In the petulance of his optimism he was
6249,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,like a lad.
6250,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6251,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"There was no change in the early part of last year, although it was"
6252,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,manifest that the incessant journeying between Batsford and London
6253,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"exhausted him. The garden occupied him more and more, and he was"
6254,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"distracted by the great storm of the end of March, which blew down and"
6255,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"destroyed at the head of the bridge the wonderful group of cypresses,"
6256,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"which he called ""the pride of my old age."" But, after a gesture of"
6257,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"despair, he set himself energetically to repair the damage. He was in"
6258,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,his usual buoyant health when the very hot spell in May tempted him out
6259,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"on May 18th, with his agent, Mr. Kennedy, to fish at Swinbrook, a"
6260,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"beautiful village on his Oxfordshire property, of which he was"
6261,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"particularly fond. He was not successful, and in a splenetic mood he"
6262,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,flung himself at full length upon a bank of wet grass. He was not
6263,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"allowed to remain there long, but the mischief was done, and in a few"
6264,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"hours he was suffering from a bad cold. Even now, the result might not"
6265,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,have been serious had it not been that in a few days' time he was due to
6266,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,fulfil certain engagements in town. Nothing vexed Lord Redesdale more
6267,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,than not to keep a pledge. In all such matters he prided himself on
6268,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"being punctual and trustworthy, and he refused to change his plans by"
6269,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,staying at home.
6270,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,
6271,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Accordingly, on May 23rd he came to London to transact some business,"
6272,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,and to take the chair next day at a meeting of the Royal Society of
6273,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Literature, of which he was a vice-president. This meeting took place in"
6274,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"the afternoon, and he addressed a crowded assembly, which greeted him"
6275,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"with great warmth. Those who were present, and saw his bright eyes and"
6276,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"heard his ringing voice, could have no suspicion that they would see him"
6277,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,again no more. His intimate friends alone perceived that he was making a
6278,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"superlative effort. There followed a very bad night, and he went down to"
6279,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"Batsford next day, going straight to his bed, from which he never rose"
6280,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"again. His condition, at first, gave rise to little alarm. The disease,"
6281,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"which proved to be catarrhal jaundice, took its course; but for a long"
6282,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,time his spirit and his unconsciousness of danger sustained him and
6283,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,filled those around him with hope. There was no disturbance of mind to
6284,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"the very last. In a shaky hand, with his stylograph, he continued to"
6285,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"correspond with certain friends, about politics, and books, and even"
6286,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,about Veluvana. In the beginning of August there seemed to be symptoms
6287,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"of improvement, but these were soon followed by a sudden and final"
6288,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"relapse. Even after this, Lord Redesdale's interest and curiosity were"
6289,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"sustained. In his very last letter to myself, painfully scrawled only"
6290,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"one week before his death, he wrote:--"

6297,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"illuminating. Of course there are exaggerations, but he is always"
6298,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"well _documenté_, and there is much in his work that is new. I"
6299,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,don't admire his style. The abuse of the historic present is bad
6300,THE LAST DAYS OF LORD REDESDALE,"enough, but what can be said in favour of the historic future with"

6313,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"When, about Christmas time in 1898, Mr. Hardy's admirers, who were"
6314,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"expecting from him a new novel, received instead a thick volume of"
6315,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"verse, there was mingled with their sympathy and respect a little"
6316,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,disappointment and a great failure in apprehension. Those who were not
6317,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"rude enough to suggest that a cobbler should stick to his last, reminded"
6318,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,one another that many novelists had sought relaxation by trifling with
6319,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the Muses. Thackeray had published _Ballads_, and George Eliot had"
6320,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,expatiated in a _Legend of Jubal_. No one thought the worse of
6321,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,_Coningsby_ because its author had produced a _Revolutionary Epic_. It
6322,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,took some time for even intelligent criticism to see that the new
6323,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"_Wessex Poems_ did not fall into this accidental category, and still,"
6324,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"after twenty years, there survives a tendency to take the verse of Mr."
6325,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Hardy, abundant and solid as it has become, as a mere subsidiary and"
6326,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,ornamental appendage to his novels. It is still necessary to insist on
6327,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the complete independence of his career as a poet, and to point out that"
6328,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,if he had never published a page of prose he would deserve to rank high
6329,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,among the writers of his country on the score of the eight volumes of
6330,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"his verse. It is as a lyrical poet, and solely as a lyrical poet, that I"
6331,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,propose to speak of him to-day.
6332,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6333,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,It has been thought extraordinary that Cowper was over fifty when he
6334,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"published his first secular verses, but Mr. Hardy was approaching his"
6335,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,sixtieth year when he sent _Wessex Poems_ to the press. Such
6336,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"self-restraint--""none hath by more studious ways endeavoured, and with"
6337,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"more unwearied spirit none shall""--has always fascinated the genuine"
6338,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"artist, but few have practised it with so much tenacity. When the work"
6339,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"of Mr. Hardy is completed, nothing, it is probable, will more strike"
6340,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"posterity than its unity, its consistency. He has given proof, as scarce"
6341,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"any other modern writer has done, of tireless constancy of resolve. His"
6342,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,novels formed an unbroken series from the _Desperate Remedies_ of 1871
6343,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"to _The Well-Beloved_ of 1897. In the fulness of his success, and"
6344,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"unseduced by all temptation, he closed that chapter of his career, and"
6345,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"has kept it closed. Since 1898 he has been, persistently and"
6346,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"periodically, a poet and nothing else. That he determined, for reasons"
6347,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"best left to his own judgment, to defer the exhibition of his verse"
6348,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"until he had completed his work in prose, ought not to prejudice"
6349,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,criticism in its analysis of the lyrics and the colossal dramatic
6350,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"panorama. Mr. Hardy, exclusively as a poet, demands our undivided"
6351,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,attention.
6352,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6353,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,It is legitimate to speculate on other probable causes of Mr. Hardy's
6354,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"delay. From such information as lies scattered before us, we gather that"
6355,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,it was from 1865 to 1867 that he originally took poetry to be his
6356,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,vocation. The dated pieces in the volume of 1898 help us to form an idea
6357,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,of the original character of his utterance. On the whole it was very
6358,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,much what it remains in the pieces composed after a lapse of half a
6359,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"century. Already, as a very young man, Mr. Hardy possessed his"
6360,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"extraordinary insight into the movements of human character, and his"
6361,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,eloquence in translating what he had observed of the tragedy and pain of
6362,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"rustic lives. No one, for sixty years, had taken so closely to heart the"
6363,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,admonitions of Wordsworth in his famous Preface to the 1800 edition of
6364,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"_Lyrical Ballads_ to seek for inspiration in that condition where ""the"
6365,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful forms of nature."""
6366,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,But it may well be doubted whether Mr. Hardy's poems would have been
6367,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"received in the mid-Victorian age with favour, or even have been"
6368,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"comprehended. Fifty years ahead of his time, he was asking in 1866 for"
6369,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"novelty of ideas, and he must have been conscious that his questioning"
6370,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"would seem inopportune. He needed a different atmosphere, and he left"
6371,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the task of revolt to another, and, at first sight, a very unrelated"
6372,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"force, that of the _Poems and Ballads_ of the same year. But Swinburne"
6373,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"succeeded in his revolution, and although he approached the art from an"
6374,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"opposite direction, he prepared the way for an ultimate appreciation of"
6375,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Mr. Hardy.
6376,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6377,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"We should therefore regard the latter, in spite of his silence of forty"
6378,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"years, as a poet who laboured, like Swinburne, at a revolution against"
6379,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the optimism and superficial sweetness of his age. Swinburne, it is"
6380,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"true, tended to accentuate the poetic side of poetry, while Mr. Hardy"
6381,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"drew verse, in some verbal respects, nearer to prose. This does not"
6382,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"affect their common attitude, and the sympathy of these great artists"
6383,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"for one another's work has already been revealed, and will be still more"
6384,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"clearly exposed. But they were unknown to each other in 1866, when to"
6385,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"both of them the cheap philosophy of the moment, the glittering"
6386,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"femininity of the ""jewelled line,"" the intense respect for Mrs. Grundy"
6387,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"in her Sunday satin, appeared trumpery, hateful, and to be trampled"
6388,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,upon. We find in Mr. Hardy's earliest verse no echo of the passionate
6389,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,belief in personal immortality which was professed by Ruskin and
6390,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Browning. He opposed the Victorian theory of human ""progress""; the"
6391,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Tennysonian beatific Vision seemed to him ridiculous. He rejected the
6392,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"idea of the sympathy and goodness of Nature, and was in revolt against"
6393,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,the self-centredness of the Romantics. We may conjecture that he
6394,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,combined a great reverence for _The Book of Job_ with a considerable
6395,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,contempt for _In Memoriam_.
6396,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6397,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,This was not a mere rebellious fancy which passed off; it was something
6398,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"inherent that remained, and gives to-day their peculiar character to Mr."
6399,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Hardy's latest lyrics. But before we examine the features of this
6400,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"personal mode of interpreting poetry to the world, we may collect what"
6401,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,little light we can on the historic development of it. In the pieces
6402,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,dated between 1865 and 1867 we find the germ of almost everything which
6403,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"has since characterised the poet. In ""Amabel"" the ruinous passage of"
6404,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"years, which has continued to be an obsession with Mr. Hardy, is already"
6405,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,crudely dealt with. The habit of taking poetical negatives of small
6406,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"scenes--""your face, and the God-curst sun, and a tree, and a pond edged"
6407,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"with grayish leaves"" (""Neutral Times"")--which had not existed in English"
6408,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"verse since the days of Crabbe, reappears. There is marked already a"
6409,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,sense of terror and resentment against the blind motions of chance--In
6410,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""Hap"" the author would positively welcome a certainty of divine hatred"
6411,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"as a relief from the strain of depending upon ""crass casualty."" Here and"
6412,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,there in these earliest pieces an extreme difficulty of utterance is
6413,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,remarkable in the face of the ease which the poet attained afterwards in
6414,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,the expression of his most strange images and fantastic revelations. We
6415,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"read in ""At a Bridal"":--"
6416,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,

6420,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"As had fired ours could ever have mingled we!"""
6421,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6422,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"This, although perfectly reducible, takes time to think out, and at a"
6423,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,hasty glance seems muffled up in obscurity beyond the darkness of Donne;
6424,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"moreover, it is scarcely worthy in form of the virtuoso which Mr. Hardy"
6425,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,was presently to become. Perhaps of the poems certainly attributable to
6426,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"this earliest period, the little cycle of sonnets called ""She to Him"""
6427,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,gives clearest promise of what was coming. The sentiment is that of
6428,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Ronsard's famous ""Quand vous serez bien vieille, au soir, à la"
6429,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"chandelle,"" but turned round, as Mr. Hardy loves to do, from the man to"
6430,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the woman, and embroidered with ingenuities, such as where the latter"
6431,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"says that as her temperament dies down the habit of loving will remain,"
6432,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,and she be

6436,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6437,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,which attest a complexity of mind that Ronsard's society knew nothing
6438,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,of.
6439,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6440,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"On the whole, we may perhaps be safe in conjecturing that whatever the"
6441,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"cause, the definite dedication to verse was now postponed. Meanwhile,"
6442,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the writing of novels had become the business of Mr. Hardy's life, and"
6443,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,ten years go by before we trace a poet in that life again. But it is
6444,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,interesting to find that when the great success of _Far from the Madding
6445,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Crowd_ had introduced him to a circle of the best readers, there"
6446,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,followed an effect which again disturbed his ambition for the moment.
6447,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Mr. Hardy was once more tempted to change the form of his work. He
6448,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"wished ""to get back to verse,"" but was dissuaded by Leslie Stephen, who"
6449,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,induced him to start writing _The Return of the Native_ instead. On
6450,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"March 29th, 1875, Coventry Patmore, then a complete stranger, wrote to"
6451,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"express his regret that ""such almost unequalled beauty and power as"
6452,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,appeared in the novels should not have assured themselves the
6453,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,immortality which would have been conferred upon them by the form of
6454,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"verse."" This was just at the moment when we find Mr. Hardy's"
6455,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"conversations with ""long Leslie Stephen in the velveteen coat"""
6456,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"obstinately turning upon ""theologies decayed and defunct, the origin of"
6457,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"things, the constitution of matter, and the unreality of time."" To this"
6458,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"period belongs also the earliest conception of _The Dynasts_, an old"
6459,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"note-book containing, under the date June 20th, 1875, the suggestion"
6460,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"that the author should attempt ""An Iliad of Europe from 1789 to 1815."""
6461,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6462,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,To this time also seems to belong the execution of what has proved the
6463,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"most attractive section of Mr. Hardy's poetry, the narratives, or short"
6464,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Wessex ballads. The method in which these came into the world is very
6465,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,curious. Many of these stories were jotted down to the extent of a
6466,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,stanza or two when the subject first occurred to the author. For
6467,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"instance, ""The Fire at Tranter Sweatley's,"" first published by Lionel"
6468,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Johnson in 1894, had been begun as early as 1867, and was finished ten"
6469,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"years later. The long ballad of ""Leipzig"" and the savage ""San"
6470,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Sebastian,"" both highly characteristic, were also conceived and a few"
6471,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"lines of each noted down long before their completion. ""Valenciennes,"""
6472,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"however, belongs to 1878, and the ""Dance at the Phoenix,"" of which the"
6473,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"stanza beginning ""'Twas Christmas"" alone had been written years before,"
6474,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,seems to have been finished about the same time. What evidence is before
6475,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,us goes to prove that in the 'seventies Mr. Hardy became a complete
6476,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"master of the art of verse, and that his poetic style was by this time"
6477,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"fixed. He still kept poetry out of public sight, but he wrote during the"
6478,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"next twenty years, as though in a backwater off the stream of his"
6479,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"novels, the poems which form the greater part of the volume of 1898. If"
6480,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"no other collection of his lyrical verse existed, we should miss a"
6481,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"multitude of fine things, but our general conception of his genius would"
6482,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,be little modified.
6483,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6484,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"We should judge carelessly, however, if we treated the subsequent"
6485,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,volumes as mere repetitions of the original _Wessex Poems_. They present
6486,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"interesting differences, which I may rapidly note before I touch on the"
6487,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,features which characterise the whole body of Mr. Hardy's verse. _Poems
6488,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"of the Past and Present_, which came out in the first days of 1902,"
6489,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"could not but be in a certain measure disappointing, in so far as it"
6490,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,paralleled its three years' product with that of the thirty years of
6491,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"_Wessex Poems_. Old pieces were published in it, and it was obvious that"
6492,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,in 1898 Mr. Hardy might be expected to have chosen from what used to be
6493,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"called his ""portfolio"" those specimens which he thought to be most"
6494,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,attractive. But on further inspection this did not prove to be quite the
6495,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"case. After pondering for twelve years on the era of Napoleon, his"
6496,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,preoccupation began in 1887 to drive him into song:--
6497,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6498,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""Must I pipe a palinody,"
6499,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Or be silent thereupon?"""
6500,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6501,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,He decides that silence has become impossible:--
6502,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6503,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""Nay; I'll sing 'The Bridge of Lodi'--"
6504,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"That long-loved, romantic thing,"
6505,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Though none show by smile or nod, he"
6506,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Guesses why and what I sing!"""
6507,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6508,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Here is the germ of _The Dynasts_. But in the meantime the crisis of the
6509,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Boer War had cut across the poet's dream of Europe a hundred years ago,"
6510,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,and a group of records of the Dorsetshire elements of the British army
6511,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,at the close of 1899 showed in Mr. Hardy's poetry what had not been
6512,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,suspected there--a military talent of a most remarkable kind. Another
6513,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,set of pieces composed in Rome were not so interesting; Mr. Hardy always
6514,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,seems a little languid when he leaves the confines of his native Wessex.
6515,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Another section of _Poems of the Past and Present_ is severely, almost"
6516,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"didactically, metaphysical, and expands in varied language the daring"
6517,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"thought, so constantly present in Mr. Hardy's reverie, that God Himself"
6518,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"has forgotten the existence of earth, this ""tiny sphere,"" this ""tainted"
6519,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"ball,"" ""so poor a thing,"" and has left all human life to be the"
6520,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"plaything of blind chance. This sad conviction is hardly ruffled by ""The"
6521,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Darkling Thrush,"" which goes as far towards optimism as Mr. Hardy can"
6522,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"let himself be drawn, or by such reflections as those in ""On a Fine"

6536,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"high promise of _Wessex Poems_. The author, in one of his modest"
6537,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"prefaces, where he seems to whisper while we bend forward in our anxiety"

6539,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Laughingstocks_ will, as a whole, take the ""reader forward, even if not"
6540,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"far, rather than backward."""
6541,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6542,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"The book, indeed, does not take us ""far"" forward, simply because the"
6543,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"writer's style and scope were definitely exposed to us already, and yet"
6544,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"it does take us ""forward,"" because the hand of the master is"
6545,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,conspicuously firmer and his touch more daring. The _Laughingstocks_
6546,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"themselves are fifteen in number, tragical stories of division and"
6547,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"isolation, of failures in passion, of the treason of physical decay. No"
6548,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,landscape of Mr. Hardy's had been more vivid than the night-pictures in
6549,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""The Revisitation,"" where the old soldier in barracks creeps out on to"
6550,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the gaunt down, and meets (by one of Mr. Hardy's coincidences) his"
6551,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"ancient mistress, and no picture more terrible than the revelation of"
6552,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,each to the other in a blaze of sunrise. What a document for the future

6556,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"all Mr. Hardy's lyrical poems--and in the horror of ""A Sunday Morning's"
6557,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Tragedy."""
6558,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6559,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"It is noticeable that _Time's Laughingstocks_ is, in some respects, a"
6560,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,more daring collection than its predecessors. We find the poet here
6561,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"entirely emancipated from convention, and guided both in religion and"
6562,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,morals exclusively by the inner light of his reflection. His energy now
6563,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,interacts on his clairvoyance with a completeness which he had never
6564,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"quite displayed before, and it is here that we find Mr. Hardy's"
6565,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,utterance peculiarly a quintessence of himself. Especially in the
6566,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,narrative pieces--which are often Wessex novels distilled into a
6567,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"wine-glass, such as ""Rose-Ann,"" and ""The Vampirine Fair""--he allows no"
6568,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"considerations of what the reader may think ""nice"" or ""pleasant"" to"
6569,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,shackle his sincerity or his determination; and it is therefore to
6570,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,_Time's Laughingstocks_ that the reader who wishes to become intimately
6571,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,acquainted with Mr. Hardy as a moralist most frequently recurs. We
6572,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,notice here more than elsewhere in his poems Mr. Hardy's sympathy with
6573,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the local music of Wessex, and especially with its expression by the"
6574,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"village choir, which he uses as a spiritual symbol. Quite a large"
6575,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,section of _Time's Laughingstocks_ takes us to the old-fashioned gallery
6576,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"of some church, where the minstrels are bowing ""New Sabbath"" or ""Mount"
6577,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Ephraim,"" or to a later scene where the ghosts, in whose melancholy"
6578,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"apparition Mr. Hardy takes such pleasure, chant their goblin melodies"
6579,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"and strum ""the viols of the dead"" in the moonlit churchyard. The very"
6580,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,essence of Mr. Hardy's reverie at this moment of his career is to be
6581,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"found, for instance, in ""The Dead Quire,"" where the ancient"
6582,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,phantom-minstrels revenge themselves on their gross grandsons outside
6583,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,the alehouse.
6584,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6585,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Almost immediately after the outbreak of the present war Mr. Hardy
6586,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,presented to a somewhat distraught and inattentive public another
6587,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,collection of his poems. It cannot be said that _Satires of
6588,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Circumstance_ is the most satisfactory of those volumes; it is, perhaps,"
6589,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,that which we could with the least discomposure persuade ourselves to
6590,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,overlook. Such a statement refers more to the high quality of other
6591,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,pages than to any positive decay of power or finish here. There is no
6592,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,less adroitness of touch and penetration of view in this book than
6593,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"elsewhere, and the poet awakens once more our admiration by his skill in"
6594,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,giving poetic value to minute conditions of life which have escaped less
6595,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,careful observers. But in _Satires of Circumstance_ the ugliness of
6596,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"experience is more accentuated than it is elsewhere, and is flung in our"
6597,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,face with less compunction. The pieces which give name to the volume are
6598,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"only fifteen in number, but the spirit which inspires them is very"
6599,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,frequently repeated in other parts of the collection. That spirit is one
6600,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"of mocking sarcasm, and it acts in every case by presenting a"
6601,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"beautifully draped figure of illusion, from which the poet, like a"
6602,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"sardonic showman, twitches away the robe that he may display a skeleton"
6603,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"beneath it. We can with little danger assume, as we read the _Satires of"
6604,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Circumstance_, hard and cruel shafts of searchlight as they seem, that"
6605,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Mr. Hardy was passing through a mental crisis when he wrote them. This
6606,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"seems to be the _Troilus and Cressida_ of his life's work, the book in"
6607,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,which he is revealed most distracted by conjecture and most overwhelmed
6608,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,by the miscarriage of everything. The wells of human hope have been
6609,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"poisoned for him by some condition of which we know nothing, and even"
6610,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the picturesque features of Dorsetshire landscape, that have always"
6611,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"before dispersed his melancholy, fail to win his attention:--"

6622,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,stanza. It is not for criticism to find fault with the theme of a work
6623,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"of art, but only to comment upon its execution. Of the merit of these"
6624,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,monotonously sinister _Satires of Circumstance_ there can be no
6625,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,question; whether the poet's indulgence in the mood which gave birth to
6626,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,them does not tend to lower our moral temperature and to lessen the
6627,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"rebound of our energy, is another matter. At all events, every one must"
6628,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,welcome a postscript in which a blast on the bugle of war seemed to have
6629,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,wakened the poet from his dark brooding to the sense of a new chapter in
6630,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,history.

6634,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"never before excelled. With the passage of years Mr. Hardy, observing"
6635,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"everything in the little world of Wessex, and forgetting nothing, has"
6636,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"become almost preternaturally wise, and, if it may be said so,"
6637,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""knowing,"" with a sort of magic, like that of a wizard. He has learned"
6638,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,to track the windings of the human heart with the familiarity of a

6640,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"he finds, be it stoat or squirrel, to the barn-door of his poetry. But"
6641,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,there is also in these last-fruits of Mr. Hardy's mossed tree much that
6642,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"is wholly detached from the bitterness of satire, much that simply"
6643,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"records, with an infinite delicacy of pathos, little incidents of the"

6645,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,fugitive fancies in the spirit of the Japanese sculptor when he chisels
6646,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,the melting of a cloud or the flight of an insect on his sword hilt:--
6647,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6648,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""I idly cut a parsley stalk"
6649,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,And blew therein towards the moon;

6662,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6663,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,We have now in brief historic survey marshalled before us the various
6664,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,volumes in which Mr. Hardy's lyrical poetry was originally collected.
6665,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Before we examine its general character more closely, it may be well to"
6666,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"call attention to its technical quality, which was singularly"
6667,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"misunderstood at first, and which has never, we believe, been boldly"
6668,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"faced. In 1898, and later, when a melodious _falsetto_ was much in"
6669,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"fashion amongst us, the reviewers found great fault with Mr. Hardy's"
6670,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,prosody; they judged him as a versifier to be rude and incorrect. As
6671,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"regards the single line, it may be confessed that Mr. Hardy, in his"
6672,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"anxiety to present his thought in an undiluted form, is not infrequently"
6673,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,clogged and hard. Such a line as
6674,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6675,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""Fused from its separateness by ecstasy"""
6676,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6677,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"hisses at us like a snake, and crawls like a wounded one. Mr. Hardy is"
6678,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"apt to clog his lines with consonants, and he seems indifferent to the"
6679,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,stiffness which is the consequence of this neglect. Ben Jonson said that
6680,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""Donne, for not keeping of accent, deserved hanging""; perhaps we may go"
6681,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"so far as to say that Mr. Hardy, for his indifference to a mellifluous"
6682,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,run lays himself open to a mild rebuke. He is negligent of that eternal
6683,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"ornament of English verse, audible intricacy, probably because of"
6684,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Swinburne's abuse of it. But most of what is called his harshness should
6685,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"rather be called bareness, and is the result of a revolt, conscious or"
6686,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"unconscious, against Keats' prescription of ""loading the rifts with"
6687,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"ore."""
6688,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6689,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"In saying this, all has been said that an enemy could in justice say in"
6690,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,blame of his metrical peculiarities. Unquestionably he does
6691,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"occasionally, like Robert Browning, err in the direction of cacophony."
6692,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"But when we turn to the broader part of prosody, we must perceive that"
6693,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Mr. Hardy is not only a very ingenious, but a very correct and admirable"
6694,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"metricist. His stanzaic invention is abundant; no other Victorian poet,"
6695,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"not even Swinburne, has employed so many forms, mostly of his own"
6696,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"invention, and employed them so appropriately, that is to say, in so"
6697,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,close harmony with the subject or story enshrined in them. To take an

6724,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"It is, however, in the narrative pieces, the little _Wessex Tales_,"
6725,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,that Mr. Hardy's metrical imagination is most triumphant. No two of
6726,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"these are identical in form, and for each he selects, or more often"
6727,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"invents, a wholly appropriate stanza. He makes many experiments, one of"
6728,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,the strangest being the introduction of rhymeless lines at regular
6729,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"intervals. Of this, ""Cicely"" is an example which repays attention:--"

6751,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Confession,"" a ballad-measure which contemporaries such as Southey or"
6752,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Campbell might have used is artfully chosen. In striking contrast we
6753,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"have the elaborate verse-form of ""The Souls of the Slain,"" in which the"
6754,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,throbbing stanza seems to dilate and withdraw like the very cloud of
6755,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,moth-like phantoms which it describes. It is difficult to follow out
6756,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"this theme without more frequent quotation than I have space, for here,"
6757,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,but the reader who pursues it carefully will not repeat the rumour that
6758,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Mr. Hardy is a careless or ""incorrect"" metricist. He is, on the"
6759,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"contrary, a metrical artist of great accomplishment."
6760,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6761,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,The conception of life revealed in his verses by this careful artist is
6762,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,one which displays very exactly the bent of his temperament. During the
6763,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,whole of his long career Mr. Hardy has not budged an inch from his
6764,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"original line of direction. He holds that, abandoned by God, treated"
6765,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"with scorn by Nature, man lies helpless at the mercy of ""those purblind"
6766,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Doomsters,"" accident, chance, and time, from whom he has had to endure"
6767,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,injury and insult from the cradle to the grave. This is stating the
6768,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Hardy doctrine in its extreme form, but it is not stating it too"
6769,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"strongly. This has been called his ""pessimism,"" a phrase to which some"
6770,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"admirers, unwilling to give things their true name, have objected. But,"
6771,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"of course, Mr. Hardy is a pessimist, just as Browning is an optimist,"
6772,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"just as white is not black, and day is not night. Our juggling with"
6773,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,words in paradox is too often apt to disguise a want of decision in
6774,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,thought. Let us admit that Mr. Hardy's conception of the fatal forces
6775,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"which beleaguer human life is a ""pessimistic"" one, or else words have no"
6776,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,meaning.
6777,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6778,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Yet it is needful to define in what this pessimism consists. It is not
6779,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,the egotism of Byron or the morbid melancholy of Chateaubriand. It is
6780,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"directed towards an observation of others, not towards an analysis of"
6781,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"self, and this gives it more philosophical importance, because although"
6782,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"romantic peevishness is very common among modern poets, and although"
6783,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"ennui inspires a multitude of sonnets, a deliberate and imaginative"
6784,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,study of useless suffering in the world around us is rare indeed among
6785,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the poets. It is particularly to be noted that Mr. Hardy, although one"
6786,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"of the most profoundly tragic of all modern writers, is neither"
6787,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,effeminate nor sickly. His melancholy could never have dictated the
6788,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"third stanza of Shelley's ""Lines written in Dejection in the Bay of"
6789,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Naples."" His pessimism is involuntary, forced from him by his experience"
6790,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"and his constitution, and no analysis could give a better definition of"
6791,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,what divides him from the petulant despair of a poet like Leopardi than
6792,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the lines ""To Life"":--"
6793,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6794,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""O life, with the sad scared face,"
6795,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"I weary of seeing thee,"
6796,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"And thy draggled cloak, and thy hobbling pace,"
6797,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,And thy too-forced pleasantry!

6813,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6814,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,But the mumming goes no deeper than it does in the exquisite poem of
6815,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""The Darkling Thrush,"" where the carolings of an aged bird, on a frosty"
6816,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"evening, are so ecstatic that they waken a vague hope in the listener's"
6817,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"mind that the thrush may possibly know of ""some blessed hope"" of which"
6818,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the poet is ""unaware."" This is as far as Mr. Hardy ever gets on the"
6819,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,blest Victorian pathway of satisfaction.
6820,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6821,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,There are certain aspects in which it is not unnatural to see a parallel
6822,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,between Mr. Hardy and George Crabbe. Each is the spokesman of a
6823,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"district, each has a passion for the study of mankind, each has gained"
6824,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,by long years of observation a profound knowledge of local human
6825,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"character, and each has plucked on the open moor, and wears in his coat,"
6826,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,the hueless flower of disillusion. But there is a great distinction in
6827,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the aim of the two poets. Crabbe, as he describes himself in _The Parish"
6828,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Register_, was ""the true physician"" who ""walks the foulest ward."" He was"
6829,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,utilitarian in his morality; he exposed the pathos of tragedy by
6830,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"dwelling on the faults which led to it, forgetful of the fatality which"
6831,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,in more consistent moments he acknowledged. Crabbe was realistic with a
6832,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"moral design, even in the _Tales of the Hall_, where he made a gallant"
6833,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,effort at last to arrive at a detachment of spirit. No such effort is
6834,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"needed by Mr. Hardy, who has none of the instinct of a preacher, and who"
6835,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"considers moral improvement outside his responsibility. He admits, with"
6836,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"his great French contemporary, that"
6837,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6838,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""Tout désir est menteur, toute joie éphémère,"
6839,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Toute liqueur au fond de la coupe est amère,"""
6840,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6841,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"but he is bent on discovering the cause of this devastation, and not"
6842,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,disposed to waste time over its consequences. At the end he produces a
6843,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,panacea which neither Crabbe nor Byron dreamed of--resignation.
6844,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6845,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,But the poet has not reached the end of his disillusion. He thinks to
6846,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"secure repose on the breast of Nature, the _alma mater_, to whom Goethe"
6847,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"and Wordsworth and Browning each in his own way turned, and were"
6848,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,rewarded by consolation and refreshment. We should be prepared to find
6849,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Mr. Hardy, with his remarkable aptitude for the perception of natural"
6850,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"forms, easily consoled by the influences of landscape and the inanimate"
6851,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,world. His range of vision is wide and extremely exact; he has the gift
6852,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,of reproducing before us scenes of various character with a vividness
6853,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"which is sometimes startling. But Mr. Hardy's disdain of sentimentality,"
6854,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"and his vigorous analysis of the facts of life, render him insensible"
6855,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"not indeed to the mystery nor to the beauty, but to the imagined"
6856,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"sympathy, of Nature. He has no more confidence in the visible earth than"
6857,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"in the invisible heavens, and neither here nor there is he able to"
6858,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,persuade himself to discover a counsellor or a friend. In this
6859,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"connection, we do well to follow the poet's train of thought in the"
6860,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"lyric called ""In a Wood,"" where he enters a copse dreaming that, in that"
6861,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"realm of ""sylvan peace,"" Nature would offer ""a soft release from man's"
6862,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"unrest."" He immediately observes that the pine and the beech are"
6863,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"struggling for existence, and trying to blight each other with dripping"
6864,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"poison. He sees the ivy eager to strangle the elm, and the hawthorns"
6865,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,choking the hollies. Even the poplars sulk and turn black under the
6866,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"shadow of a rival. In the end, filled with horror at all these crimes of"
6867,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Nature, the poet flees from the copse as from an accursed place, and he"
6868,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,determines that life offers him no consolation except the company of
6869,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,those human beings who are as beleaguered as himself:--
6870,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6871,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""Since, then, no grace I find"
6872,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Taught me of trees,"

6879,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6880,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"It is absurd, he decides, to love Nature, which has either no response"
6881,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"to give, or answers in irony. Let us even avoid, as much as we can, deep"
6882,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"concentration of thought upon the mysteries of Nature, lest we become"
6883,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"demoralised by contemplating her negligence, her blindness, her"
6884,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,implacability. We find here a violent reaction against the poetry of
6885,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,egotistic optimism which had ruled the romantic school in England for
6886,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"more than a hundred years, and we recognise a branch of Mr. Hardy's"
6887,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"originality. He has lifted the veil of Isis, and he finds beneath it,"
6888,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"not a benevolent mother of men, but the tomb of an illusion. One short"
6889,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"lyric, ""Yell'ham-Wood's Story,"" puts this, again with a sylvan setting,"
6890,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,in its unflinching crudity:--
6891,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6892,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""Coomb-Firtrees say that Life is a moan,"
6893,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,And Clyffe-hill Clump says 'Yea!'

6895,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"It's not, 'Gray, gray,"
6896,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Is Life alway!'
6897,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"That Yell'ham says,"
6898,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Nor that Life is for ends unknown.
6899,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,

6904,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"In fall, in spring,"
6905,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,That Yell'ham says:--

6907,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6908,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,It is therefore almost exclusively to the obscure history of those who
6909,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"suffer and stumble around him, victims of the universal disillusion, men"
6910,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"and women ""come to live but called to die,"" that Mr. Hardy dedicates his"
6911,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"poetic function. ""Lizbie Browne"" appeals to us as a typical instance of"
6912,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"his rustic pathos, his direct and poignant tenderness, and if we compare"
6913,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"it with such poems of Wordsworth's as ""Lucy Gray"" or ""Alice Fell"" we see"
6914,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,that he starts by standing much closer to the level of the subject than
6915,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,his great predecessor does. Wordsworth is the benevolent philosopher

6919,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Sometimes, as in the remarkable colloquy called ""The Ruined Maid,"" his"
6920,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,sympathy is so close as to offer an absolute flout in the face to the

6922,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"sentimental morals, but with the primitive instincts of the soul,"
6923,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"applauding them, or at least recording them with complacency, even when"
6924,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"they outrage ethical tradition, as they do in the lyric narrative called"
6925,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""A Wife and Another."" The stanzas ""To an Unborn Pauper Child"" sum up"

6929,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,His temperature is not always so low as it is in the class of poems to
6930,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"which we have just referred, but his ultimate view is never more"

6932,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"surveying the hot-blooded couples, and urging them on by the lilt of"
6933,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"his instrument, but he is always perfectly aware that they will have ""to"

6935,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"more remarkable than the poem called ""Julie-Jane,"" a perfect example of"
6936,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Mr. Hardy's metrical ingenuity and skill, which begins thus:--"
6937,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6938,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""Sing; how 'a would sing!"
6939,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,How 'a would raise the tune

6952,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6953,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,and which then turns to the most plaintive and the most irreparable
6954,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"tragedy, woven, as a black design on to a background of gold, upon this"
6955,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,basis of temperamental joyousness.
6956,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6957,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Alphonse Daudet once said that the great gift of Edmond de Goncourt was
6958,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"to, ""_rendre l'irrendable_."" This is much more true of Mr. Hardy than it"
6959,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"was of Goncourt, and more true than it is of any other English poet"
6960,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"except Donne. There is absolutely no observation too minute, no flutter"
6961,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"of reminiscence too faint, for Mr. Hardy to adopt as the subject of a"
6962,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"metaphysical lyric, and his skill in this direction has grown upon him;"
6963,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"it is nowhere so remarkable as in his latest volume, aptly termed"
6964,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,_Moments of Vision_. Everything in village life is grist to his mill; he
6965,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"seems to make no selection, and his field is modest to humility and yet"
6966,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,practically boundless. We have a poem on the attitude of two people with
6967,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"nothing to do and no book to read, waiting in the parlour of an hotel"
6968,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"for the rain to stop, a recollection after more than forty years. That"
6969,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,the poet once dropped a pencil into the cranny of an old church where he
6970,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,was sketching inspires an elaborate lyric. The disappearance of a rotted
6971,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"summer-house, the look of a row of silver drops of fog condensed on the"
6972,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"bar of a gate, the effect of candlelight years and years ago on a"
6973,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"woman's neck and hair, the vision of a giant at a fair, led by a dwarf"
6974,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,with a red string--such are amongst the subjects which awaken in Mr.
6975,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Hardy thoughts which do often lie too deep for tears, and call for"
6976,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"interpretation in verse. The skeleton of a lady's sunshade, picked up on"
6977,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Swanage Cliffs, the pages of a fly-blown Testament lying in a railway"
6978,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"waiting-room, a journeying boy in a third-class carriage, with his"
6979,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,ticket stuck in the band of his hat--such are among the themes which
6980,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,awake in Mr. Hardy's imagination reveries which are always wholly
6981,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,serious and usually deeply tragic.
6982,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
6983,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Mr. Hardy's notation of human touches hitherto excluded from the realm
6984,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,of poetry is one of the most notable features of his originality. It
6985,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"marked his work from the beginning, as in the early ballad of ""The"
6986,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Widow,"" where the sudden damping of the wooer's amatory ardour in"
6987,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,consequence of his jealousy of the child is rendered with extraordinary
6988,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,refinement. The difficulty of course is to know when to stop. There is
6989,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"always a danger that a poet, in his search after the infinitely"
6990,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"ingenious, may lapse into _amphigory_, into sheer absurdity and"
6991,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"triviality, which Cowper, in spite of his elegant lightness, does not"
6992,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"always escape. Wordsworth, more serious in his intent, fell headlong in"
6993,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"parts of _Peter Bell_, and in such ballads as ""Betty Foy."" Mr. Hardy,"
6994,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"whatever the poverty of his incident, commonly redeems it by the oddity"
6995,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"of his observation; as in ""The Pedigree"":--"

7006,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
7007,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Mr. Hardy's love of strange experiences, and of adventures founded on a"
7008,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"balance of conscience and instinct, is constantly exemplified in those"
7009,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,ballads and verse-anecdotes which form the section of his poetry most
7010,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"appreciated by the general public. Among these, extraordinarily"
7011,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"representative of the poet's habit of mind, is ""My Cicely,"" a tale of"
7012,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the eighteenth century, where a man impetuously rides from London"
7013,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,through Wessex to be present at the funeral of the wrong woman; as he
7014,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"returns, by a coincidence, he meets the right woman, whom he used to"
7015,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"love, and is horrified at ""her liquor-fired face, her thick accents."" He"
7016,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,determines that by an effort of will the dead woman (whom he never saw)
7017,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"shall remain, what she seemed during his wild ride, ""_my_ Cicely,"" and"
7018,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,the living woman be expunged from memory. A similar deliberate electing
7019,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"that the dream shall hold the place of the fact is the motive of ""The"
7020,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Well-Beloved."" The ghastly humour of ""The Curate's Kindness"" is a sort"
7021,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,of reverse action of the same mental subtlety. Misunderstanding takes a
7022,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"very prominent place in Mr. Hardy's irony of circumstance; as, almost"
7023,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"too painfully, in ""The Rash Bride,"" a hideous tale of suicide following"
7024,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,on the duplicity of a tender and innocent widow.
7025,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
7026,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"The grandmother of Mr. Hardy was born in 1772, and survived until 1857."
7027,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,From her lips he heard many an obscure old legend of the life of Wessex
7028,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,in the eighteenth century. Was it she who told him the terrible Exmoor
7029,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"story of ""The Sacrilege;"" the early tale of ""The Two Men,"" which might"
7030,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,be the skeleton-scenario for a whole elaborate novel; or that
7031,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"incomparable comedy in verse, ""The Fire at Tranter Sweatley's,"" with its"
7032,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,splendid human touch at the very end? We suspect that it was; and
7033,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,perhaps at the same source he acquired his dangerous insight into the
7034,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"female heart, whether exquisitely feeble as in ""The Home-coming"" with"
7035,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"its delicate and ironic surprise, or treacherous, as in the desolating"
7036,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"ballad of ""Rose-Ann."" No one, in prose or verse, has expatiated more"
7037,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"poignantly than Mr. Hardy on what our forefathers used to call ""cases of"
7038,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"conscience."" He seems to have shared the experiences of souls to whom"
7039,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"life was ""a wood before your doors, and a labyrinth within the wood, and"
7040,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"locks and bars to every door within that labyrinth,"" as Jeremy Taylor"
7041,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,describes that of the anxious penitents who came to him to confession.
7042,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"The probably very early story of ""The Casterbridge Captains"" is a"
7043,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"delicate study in compunction, and a still more important example is"
7044,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""The Alarm,"" where the balance of conscience and instinct gives to what"
7045,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,in coarser hands might seem the most trivial of actions a momentous
7046,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,character of tragedy.

7048,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"This is one of Mr. Hardy's studies in military history, where he is"
7049,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,almost always singularly happy. His portraits of the non-commissioned
7050,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,officer of the old service are as excellent in verse as they are in the
7051,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,prose of _The Trumpet-Major_ or _The Melancholy Hussar_. The reader of
7052,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the novels will not have to be reminded that ""Valenciennes"" and the"
7053,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,other ballads have their prose-parallel in Simon Burden's reminiscences
7054,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"of Minden. Mr. Hardy, with a great curiosity about the science of war"
7055,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"and a close acquaintance with the mind of the common soldier, has"
7056,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"pondered on the philosophy of fighting. ""The Man he Killed,"" written in"
7057,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"1902, expresses the wonder of the rifleman who is called upon to shoot"

7068,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
7069,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,A poet so profoundly absorbed in the study of life could not fail to
7070,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,speculate on the probabilities of immortality. Here Mr. Hardy presents
7071,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,to us his habitual serenity in negation. He sees the beautiful human
7072,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"body ""lined by tool of time,"" and he asks what becomes of it when its"
7073,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,dissolution is complete. He sees no evidence of a conscious state after
7074,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"death, of what would have to be, in the case of aged or exhausted"
7075,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"persons, a revival of spiritual force, and on the whole he is"
7076,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,disinclined to cling to the faith in a future life. He holds that the
7077,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"immortality of a dead man resides in the memory of the living, his"
7078,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"""finer part shining within ever-faithful hearts of those bereft."" He"
7079,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,pursues this theme in a large number of his most serious and affecting
7080,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"lyrics, most gravely perhaps in ""The To-be-Forgotten"" and in ""The"
7081,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Superseded."" This sense of the forlorn condition of the dead, surviving"
7082,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"only in the dwindling memory of the living, inspires what has some"
7083,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"claims to be considered the loveliest of all Mr. Hardy's poems, ""Friends"
7084,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"Beyond,"" which in its tenderness, its humour, and its pathos contains in"
7085,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,a few pages every characteristic of his genius.
7086,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
7087,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,His speculation perceives the dead as a crowd of slowly vanishing
7088,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"phantoms, clustering in their ineffectual longing round the footsteps of"
7089,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,those through whom alone they continue to exist. This conception has
7090,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"inspired Mr. Hardy with several wonderful visions, among which the"
7091,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"spectacle of ""The Souls of the Slain"" in the Boer War, alighting, like"
7092,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"vast flights of moths, over Portland Bill at night, is the most"
7093,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,remarkable. It has the sublimity and much of the character of some
7094,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,apocalyptic design by Blake. The volume of 1902 contains a whole group
7095,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"of phantasmal pieces of this kind, where there is frequent mention of"
7096,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"spectres, who address the poet in the accents of nature, as in the"
7097,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"unrhymed ode called ""The Mother Mourns."" The obsession of old age, with"
7098,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"its physical decay (""I look into my glass""), the inevitable division"
7099,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,which leads to that isolation which the poet regards as the greatest of
7100,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"adversities (""The Impercipient""), the tragedies of moral indecision, the"
7101,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"contrast between the tangible earth and the bodyless ghosts, and endless"
7102,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"repetition of the cry, ""Why find we us here?"" and of the question ""Has"
7103,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"some Vast Imbecility framed us in jest, and left us now to"
7104,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"hazardry?""--all start from the overwhelming love of physical life and"
7105,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"acquaintance with its possibilities, which Mr. Hardy possesses to an"
7106,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,inordinate degree.
7107,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
7108,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,It would be ridiculous at the close of an essay to attempt any
7109,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,discussion of the huge dramatic panorama which many believe to be Mr.
7110,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,Hardy's most weighty contribution to English literature. The spacious
7111,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,theatre of _The Dynasts_ with its comprehensive and yet concise
7112,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"realisations of vast passages of human history, is a work which calls"
7113,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"for a commentary as lengthy as itself, and yet needs no commentary at"
7114,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,all. No work of the imagination is more its own interpreter than this
7115,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"sublime historic peep-show, this rolling vision of the Napoleonic"
7116,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"chronicle drawn on the broadest lines, and yet in detail made up of"
7117,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,intensely concentrated and vivid glimpses of reality. But the subject of
7118,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"my present study, the lyrical poetry of Mr. Hardy, is not largely"
7119,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"illustrated in _The Dynasts_, except by the choral interludes of the"
7120,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"phantom intelligences, which have great lyrical value, and by three or"
7121,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,four admirable songs.
7122,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
7123,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,When we resume the effect which the poetry of Mr. Hardy makes upon the
7124,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"careful reader, we note, as I have indicated already, a sense of unity"
7125,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,of direction throughout. Mr. Hardy has expressed himself in a thousand
7126,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"ways, but has never altered his vision. From 1867 to 1917, through half"
7127,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"a century of imaginative creation, he has not modified the large"
7128,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,outlines of his art in the smallest degree. To early readers of his
7129,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"poems, before the full meaning of them became evident, his voice sounded"
7130,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"inharmonious, because it did not fit in with the exquisite melodies of"
7131,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"the later Victorian age. But Mr. Hardy, with characteristic pertinacity,"
7132,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"did not attempt to alter his utterance in the least, and now we can all"
7133,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"perceive, if we take the trouble to do so, that what seemed harsh in his"
7134,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,poetry was his peculiar and personal mode of interpreting his thoughts
7135,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,to the world.
7136,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,
7137,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"As in his novels so in his poems, Mr. Hardy has chosen to remain local,"
7138,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,to be the interpreter for present and future times of one rich and
7139,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,neglected province of the British realm. From his standpoint there he
7140,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"contemplates the wide aspect of life, but it seems huge and misty to"
7141,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"him, and he broods over the tiny incidents of Wessex idiosyncracy. His"
7142,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,"irony is audacious and even sardonic, and few poets have been less"
7143,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,solicitous to please their weaker brethren. But no poet of modern times
7144,THE LYRICAL POETRY OF THOMAS HARDY,has been more careful to avoid the abstract and to touch upon the real.

7152,SOME SOLDIER POETS,The two years which preceded the outbreak of the war were marked in this
7153,SOME SOLDIER POETS,country by a revival of public interest in the art of poetry. To this
7154,SOME SOLDIER POETS,movement coherence was given and organisation introduced by Mr. Edward
7155,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Marsh's now-famous volume entitled _Georgian Poetry_. The effect of this
7156,SOME SOLDIER POETS,collection--for it is hardly correct to call it an anthology--of the
7157,SOME SOLDIER POETS,best poems written by the youngest poets since 1911 was two-fold; it
7158,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"acquainted readers with work few had ""the leisure or the zeal to"
7159,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"investigate,"" and it brought the writers themselves together in a"
7160,SOME SOLDIER POETS,corporate and selected relation. I do not recollect that this had been
7161,SOME SOLDIER POETS,done--except prematurely and partially by _The Germ_ of 1850--since the
7162,SOME SOLDIER POETS,_England's Parnassus_ and _England's Helicon_ of 1600. In point of fact
7163,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the only real precursor of Mr. Marsh's venture in our whole literature
7164,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"is the _Songs and Sonnettes_ of 1557, commonly known as _Tottel's"
7165,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Miscellany_. Tottel brought together, for the first time, the lyrics of"
7166,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Wyatt, Surrey, Churchyard, Vaux, and Bryan, exactly as Mr. Marsh called"
7167,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"public attention to Rupert Brooke, James Elroy Flecker and the rest of"
7168,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the Georgians, and he thereby fixed the names of those poets, as Mr."
7169,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Marsh has fixed those of our youngest fledglings, on the roll of English"
7170,SOME SOLDIER POETS,literature.
7171,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7172,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"The general tone of the latest poetry, up to the moment of the outbreak"
7173,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"of hostilities, was pensive, instinct with natural piety, given somewhat"
7174,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"in excess to description of landscape, tender in feeling, essentially"
7175,SOME SOLDIER POETS,unaggressive except towards the clergy and towards other versifiers of
7176,SOME SOLDIER POETS,an earlier generation. There was absolutely not a trace in any one of
7177,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the young poets of that arrogance and vociferous defiance which marked
7178,SOME SOLDIER POETS,German verse during the same years. These English shepherds might hit at
7179,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"their elders with their staves, but they had turned their swords into"
7180,SOME SOLDIER POETS,pruning-hooks and had no scabbards to rattle. This is a point which
7181,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"might have attracted notice, if we had not all been too drowsy in the"
7182,SOME SOLDIER POETS,lap of our imperial prosperity to observe the signs of the times in
7183,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Berlin. Why did no one call our attention to the beating of the big drum
7184,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"which was going on so briskly on the Teutonic Parnassus? At all events,"
7185,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"there was no echo of such a noise in the ""chambers of imagery"" which"

7193,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7194,SOME SOLDIER POETS,The youngest poets were more completely taken by surprise in August 1914
7195,SOME SOLDIER POETS,than their elders. The earliest expressions of lyric military feeling
7196,SOME SOLDIER POETS,came from veteran voices. It was only proper that the earliest of all
7197,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"should be the Poet Laureate's address to England, ending with the"
7198,SOME SOLDIER POETS,prophecy:--
7199,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7200,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""Much suffering shall cleanse thee!"
7201,SOME SOLDIER POETS,But thou through the flood
7202,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Shalt win to Salvation,"
7203,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"To Beauty through blood."""
7204,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7205,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"As sensation, however, followed sensation in those first terrific and"
7206,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"bewildering weeks, much was happening that called forth with the utmost"
7207,SOME SOLDIER POETS,exuberance the primal emotions of mankind; there was full occasion for
7208,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7209,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""exultations, agonies,"
7210,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And love, and man's unconquerable mind."""
7211,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7212,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"By September a full chorus was vocal, led by our national veteran, Mr."
7213,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Thomas Hardy, with his _Song of the Soldiers_:--"
7214,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7215,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""What of the faith and fire within us,"
7216,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Men who march away
7217,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Ere the barn-cocks say
7218,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Night is growing gray,"
7219,SOME SOLDIER POETS,To hazards whence no tears can win us;
7220,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"What of the faith and fire within us,"
7221,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Men who march away?"""
7222,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7223,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Already, before the close of the autumn of 1914, four or five"
7224,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"anthologies of war-poems were in the press, and the desire of the"
7225,SOME SOLDIER POETS,general public to be fed with patriotic and emotional verse was
7226,SOME SOLDIER POETS,manifested in unmistakable ways. We had been accustomed for some time
7227,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"past to the issue of a multitude of little pamphlets of verse, often"
7228,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"very carefully written, and these the critics had treated with an"
7229,SOME SOLDIER POETS,indulgence which would have whitened the hair of the stern reviewers of
7230,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"forty years ago. The youthful poets, almost a trade-union in themselves,"
7231,SOME SOLDIER POETS,protected one another by their sedulous generosity. It was very unusual
7232,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"to see anything criticised, much less ""slated""; the balms of praise were"
7233,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"poured over every rising head, and immortalities were predicted by the"
7234,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"dozen. Yet, as a rule, the sale of these little poetic pamphlets had"
7235,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"been small, and they had been read only by those who had a definite"
7236,SOME SOLDIER POETS,object in doing so.
7237,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7238,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"The immediate success of the anthologies, however, proved that the war"
7239,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"had aroused in a new public an ear for contemporary verse, an attention"
7240,SOME SOLDIER POETS,anxious to be stirred or soothed by the assiduous company of poets who
7241,SOME SOLDIER POETS,had been ripening their talents in a little clan. These had now an
7242,SOME SOLDIER POETS,eager world ready to listen to them. The result was surprising; we may
7243,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"even, without exaggeration, call it unparalleled. There had never"
7244,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"before, in the world's history, been an epoch which had tolerated and"
7245,SOME SOLDIER POETS,even welcomed such a flood of verse as was poured forth over Great
7246,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Britain during the first three years of the war. Those years saw the
7247,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"publication, as I am credibly informed, of more than five hundred"
7248,SOME SOLDIER POETS,volumes of new and original poetry. It would be the silliest
7249,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"complaisance to pretend that all of this, or much of it, or any but a"
7250,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"very little of it, has been of permanent value. Much of it was windy and"
7251,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"superficial, striving in wild vague terms to express great agitations"
7252,SOME SOLDIER POETS,which were obscurely felt by the poet. There was too much of the bathos
7253,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"of rhetoric, especially at first; too much addressing the German as"
7254,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""thou fell, bloody brute,"" and the like, which broke no bones and took"
7255,SOME SOLDIER POETS,no trenches.
7256,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7257,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"When once it was understood that, as a cancelled line in Tennyson's"
7258,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"_Maud_ has it,"
7259,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7260,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""The long, long canker of peace was over and done,"""
7261,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7262,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the sentiments of indignation and horror made themselves felt with
7263,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"considerable vivacity. In this direction, however, none of the youngest"
7264,SOME SOLDIER POETS,poets approached Sir Owen Seaman in the vigour of their invective. Most
7265,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"of them seemed to be overpowered by the political situation, and few"
7266,SOME SOLDIER POETS,could free themselves from their inured pacific habit of speech. Even
7267,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"when they wrote of Belgium, the Muse seemed rather to weep than to"
7268,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"curse. Looking back to the winter of 1914, it is almost pathetic to"
7269,SOME SOLDIER POETS,observe how difficult it was for our easy-going British bards to hate
7270,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the Germans. There was a good deal of ineffective violence, and"
7271,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"considerable misuse of technical terms, caused, in many cases, by a too"
7272,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"hasty reference to newspaper reports of gallantry under danger, in the"
7273,SOME SOLDIER POETS,course of which the more or less obscure verbiage of military science
7274,SOME SOLDIER POETS,was picturesquely and inaccurately employed. As the slightly censorious
7275,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"reader looks back upon these poems of the beginning of the War, he"
7276,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"cannot resist a certain impatience. In the first place, there is a"
7277,SOME SOLDIER POETS,family likeness which makes it impossible to distinguish one writer from
7278,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"another, and there is a tendency to a smug approval of British"
7279,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"prejudice, and to a horrible confidence in England's power of ""muddling"
7280,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"through,"" which look rather ghastly in the light of subsequent"
7281,SOME SOLDIER POETS,struggles.
7282,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7283,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"There was, however, a new spirit presently apparent, and a much"
7284,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"healthier one. The bards became soldiers, and in crossing over to France"
7285,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"and Flanders, each had packed his flute in his kit. They began to send"
7286,SOME SOLDIER POETS,home verses in which they translated into music their actual experiences
7287,SOME SOLDIER POETS,and their authentic emotions. We found ourselves listening to young men
7288,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"who had something new, and what was better, something noble to say to"
7289,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"us, and we returned to the national spirit which inspired the Chansons"
7290,SOME SOLDIER POETS,de Geste in the eleventh century. To the spirit--but not in the least to
7291,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the form, since it is curious that the war-poetry of 1914-17 was, even"
7292,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"in the most skilful hands, poetry on a small scale. The two greatest of"
7293,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the primal species of verse, the Epic and the Ode, were entirely"
7294,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"neglected, except, as will later be observed, in one notable instance by"
7295,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Major Maurice Baring. As a rule, the poets constrained themselves to"
7296,SOME SOLDIER POETS,observe the discipline of a rather confined lyrical analysis in forms of
7297,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the simplest character. Although particular examples showed a rare
7298,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"felicity of touch, and although the sincerity of the reflection in many"
7299,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"cases hit upon very happy forms of expression, it is impossible to"
7300,SOME SOLDIER POETS,overlook the general monotony. There used to be a story that the
7301,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Japanese Government sent a committee of its best art-critics to study
7302,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the relative merits of the modern European painters, and that they"
7303,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"returned with the bewildered statement that they could make no report,"
7304,SOME SOLDIER POETS,because all European pictures were exactly alike. A student from
7305,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Patagonia might conceivably argue that he could discover no difference
7306,SOME SOLDIER POETS,whatever between our various poets of the war.
7307,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7308,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"This would be unjust, but it is perhaps not unfair to suggest that the"
7309,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"determined resistance to all restraint, which has marked the latest"
7310,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"school, is not really favourable to individuality. There has been a very"
7311,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"general, almost a universal tendency to throw off the shackles of poetic"
7312,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"form. It has been supposed that by abandoning the normal restraints, or"
7313,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"artificialities, of metre and rhyme, a greater directness and fidelity"
7314,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"would be secured. Of course, if an intensified journalistic impression"
7315,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"is all that is desired, ""prose cut up into lengths"" is the readiest"
7316,SOME SOLDIER POETS,by-way to effect. But if the poets desire--and they all do desire--to
7317,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"speak to ages yet unborn, they should not forget that all the experience"
7318,SOME SOLDIER POETS,of history goes to prove discipline not unfavourable to poetic
7319,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"sincerity, while, on the other hand, the absence of all restraint is"
7320,SOME SOLDIER POETS,fatal to it. Inspiration does not willingly attend upon flagging metre
7321,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"and discordant rhyme, and never in the whole choral progress from Pindar"
7322,SOME SOLDIER POETS,down to Swinburne has a great master been found who did not exult in the
7323,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"stubbornness of ""dancing words and speaking strings,"" or who did not"
7324,SOME SOLDIER POETS,find his joy in reducing them to harmony. The artist who avoids all
7325,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"difficulties may be pleased with the rapidity of his effect, but he will"
7326,SOME SOLDIER POETS,have the vexation of finding his success an ephemeral one. The old
7327,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"advice to the poet, in preparing the rich chariot of the Muse, still"
7328,SOME SOLDIER POETS,holds good:--
7329,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7330,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""Let the postillion, Nature, mount, but let"
7331,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"The coachman, Art, be set."""
7332,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7333,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Too many of our recent rebellious bards fancy that the coach will drive
7334,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"itself, if only the post-boy sticks his heels hard into Pegasus."
7335,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7336,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"It is not, however, the object of this essay to review all the poetry"
7337,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"which was written about the war, nor even that part of it which owed its"
7338,SOME SOLDIER POETS,existence to the strong feeling of non-combatants at home. I propose to
7339,SOME SOLDIER POETS,fix our attention on what was written by the young soldiers themselves
7340,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"in their beautiful gallantry, verse which comes to us hallowed by the"
7341,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"glorious effort of battle, and in too many poignant cases by the"
7342,SOME SOLDIER POETS,ultimate sacrifice of life itself. The poet achieves his highest meed of
7343,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"contemporary glory, if"
7344,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7345,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""some brave young man's untimely fate"
7346,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"In words worth, dying for he celebrate,"""
7347,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7348,SOME SOLDIER POETS,and when he is himself a young man striving for the same deathless
7349,SOME SOLDIER POETS,honour on the same field of blood it is difficult to conceive of
7350,SOME SOLDIER POETS,circumstances more poignant than those which surround his effort. On
7351,SOME SOLDIER POETS,many of these poets a death of the highest nobility set the seal of
7352,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"eternal life. They were simple and passionate, radiant and calm, they"
7353,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"fought for their country, and they have entered into glory. This alone"
7354,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"might be enough to say in their praise, but star differeth from star in"
7355,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"brightness, and from the constellation I propose to select half a dozen"
7356,SOME SOLDIER POETS,of the clearest luminaries. What is said in honest praise of these may
7357,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"be said, with due modification, of many others who miss merely the"
7358,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"polish of their accomplishment. It is perhaps worth noticing, in"
7359,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"passing, that most of the poets are men of university training, and that"
7360,SOME SOLDIER POETS,certain literary strains are common to the rank and file of them. The
7361,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"influence of Tennyson, Browning, Swinburne, and Rossetti is almost"
7362,SOME SOLDIER POETS,entirely absent. The only one of the great Victorians whom they seem to
7363,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"have read is Matthew Arnold, but it is impossible to help observing that"
7364,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the _Shropshire Lad_ of Mr. A.E. Housman was in the tunic-pocket of
7365,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"every one of them. Among the English poets of the past, it is mainly the"
7366,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"so-called ""metaphysical"" writers in the seventeenth century whom they"
7367,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"studied; Donne seems to have been a favourite with them all, and Vaughan"
7368,SOME SOLDIER POETS,and Treherne were not far behind.
7369,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7370,SOME SOLDIER POETS,The spontaneous instinct of readers has taken the name of Rupert Brooke
7371,SOME SOLDIER POETS,to illustrate the poetic spirit of the great war in a superlative
7372,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"degree. His posthumous volume, brought out in May 1915, a few weeks"
7373,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"after his death, has enjoyed a success which is greater, perhaps, than"
7374,SOME SOLDIER POETS,that of all the other poems of the war put together. He has become a
7375,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"sort of symbol, even a sort of fetish, and he is to English sentiment"
7376,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"what Charles Péguy is to France, an oriflamme of the chivalry of his"
7377,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"country. It is curious, in this connection, that neither Péguy nor"
7378,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Brooke had the opportunity of fighting much in the cause; they fell, as"
7379,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"it seemed for the moment, obscurely. Rupert Brooke was a pawn in the"
7380,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"dark and dolorous flight from Antwerp. He died in the Ægean, between"
7381,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Egypt and Gallipoli, having never seen a Turkish enemy. So Péguy faded"
7382,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"out of sight on the very opening day of the battle of the Marne, yet"
7383,SOME SOLDIER POETS,each of these young men was immediately perceived to have embodied the
7384,SOME SOLDIER POETS,gallantry of his country. The extraordinary popularity of Rupert Brooke
7385,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"is due to the excellence of his verse, to the tact with which it was"
7386,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"presented to the public, but also to a vague perception of his"
7387,SOME SOLDIER POETS,representative nature. He was the finest specimen of a certain type
7388,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"produced at the universities, and then sacrificed to our national"
7389,SOME SOLDIER POETS,necessity.
7390,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7391,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"It is needless to describe the verses of Rupert Brooke, which have"
7392,SOME SOLDIER POETS,attained a circulation which any poet might envy. They are comprised in
7393,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"two slender volumes, that above mentioned, and one of 1911, published"
7394,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"while he was still at Cambridge. He was born in 1887, and when he died"
7395,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"off Skyros, in circumstances of the most romantic pathos, he had not"
7396,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"completed his twenty-eighth year. He was, unlike the majority of his"
7397,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"contemporaries, a meticulous and reserved writer, little inclined to be"
7398,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"pleased with his work, and cautious to avoid the snare of improvisation."
7399,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Hence, though he lived to be older than did Keats or Fergusson, he left"
7400,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"a very slender garland of verse behind him, in which there is scarcely a"
7401,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"petal which is not of some permanent value. For instance, in the volume"
7402,SOME SOLDIER POETS,of 1911 we found not a few pieces which then seemed crude in taste and
7403,SOME SOLDIER POETS,petulant in temper; but even these now illustrate a most interesting
7404,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"character of which time has rounded the angles, and we would not have"
7405,SOME SOLDIER POETS,otherwise what illustrates so luminously--and so divertingly--that
7406,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"precious object, the mind of Rupert Brooke."
7407,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7408,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Yet there is a danger that this mind and character may be
7409,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"misinterpreted, even by those who contemplate the poet's memory with"
7410,SOME SOLDIER POETS,idolatry. There is some evidence of a Rupert Brooke legend in the
7411,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"process of formation, which deserves to be guarded against not less"
7412,SOME SOLDIER POETS,jealously than the R.L. Stevenson legend of a few years ago. We know
7413,SOME SOLDIER POETS,that for some people gold and lilies are not properly honoured until
7414,SOME SOLDIER POETS,they are gilded and painted. Rupert Brooke was far from being either a
7415,SOME SOLDIER POETS,plaster saint or a vivid public witness. He was neither a trumpet nor a
7416,SOME SOLDIER POETS,torch. He lives in the memory of those who knew him as a smiling and
7417,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"attentive spectator, eager to watch every flourish of the pageantry of"
7418,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"life. Existence was a wonderful harmony to Rupert Brooke, who was"
7419,SOME SOLDIER POETS,determined to lose no tone of it by making too much noise himself. In
7420,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"company he was not a great talker, but loved to listen, with sparkling"
7421,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"deference, to people less gifted than himself if only they had"
7422,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"experience to impart. He lived in a fascinated state, bewitched with"
7423,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"wonder and appreciation. His very fine appearance, which seemed to glow"
7424,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"with dormant vitality, his beautiful manners, the quickness of his"
7425,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"intelligence, his humour, were combined under the spell of a curious"
7426,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"magnetism, difficult to analyse. When he entered a room, he seemed to"
7427,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"bring sunshine with him, although he was usually rather silent, and"
7428,SOME SOLDIER POETS,pointedly immobile. I do not think it would be easy to recollect any
7429,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"utterance of his which was very remarkable, but all he said and did"
7430,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"added to the harmonious, ardent, and simple effect."
7431,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7432,SOME SOLDIER POETS,There is very little of the poetry of Rupert Brooke which can be
7433,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"definitely identified with the war. The last six months of his life,"
7434,SOME SOLDIER POETS,spent in conditions for which nothing in his previous existence in
7435,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Cambridge or Berlin, in Grantchester or Tahiti, had in the least"
7436,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"prepared him, were devoted--for we must not say wasted--to breaking up"
7437,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the _cliché_ of civilised habits. But of this harassed time there remain
7438,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"to us the five immortal Sonnets, which form the crown of Rupert Brooke's"
7439,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"verse, and his principal legacy to English literature. Our record would"
7440,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"be imperfect without the citation of one, perhaps the least hackneyed of"
7441,SOME SOLDIER POETS,these:--
7442,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7443,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!"
7444,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,"
7445,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold."
7446,SOME SOLDIER POETS,These laid the world away; poured out the red
7447,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be
7448,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,"
7449,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"That men call age; and those who would have been,"
7450,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Their sons, they gave, their immortality."
7451,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7452,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth,"
7453,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Holiness, lacked so long, and Love and Pain."
7454,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,"
7455,SOME SOLDIER POETS,And paid his subjects with a royal wage;
7456,SOME SOLDIER POETS,And Nobleness walks in our ways again;
7457,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And we have come into our heritage."""
7458,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7459,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"If the fortune of his country had not disturbed his plans, it is more"
7460,SOME SOLDIER POETS,than probable that Rupert Brooke would have become an enlightened and
7461,SOME SOLDIER POETS,enthusiastic professor. Of the poet who detains us next it may be said
7462,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"that there was hardly any walk of life, except precisely this, which he"
7463,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"could not have adorned. Julian Grenfell, who was a poet almost by"
7464,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"accident, resembled the most enlightened of the young Italian noblemen"
7465,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"of the Renaissance, who gave themselves with violence to a surfeit of"
7466,SOME SOLDIER POETS,knowledge and a riot of action. He was a humanist of the type of the
7467,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"fifteenth century, soldier, scholar, and man of pleasure, such as we"
7468,SOME SOLDIER POETS,read of in Vespasiano's famous book. Everything he did was done in the
7469,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"service of St. Epicurus, it was done to _darsi buon tempo_, as the"
7470,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Tuscans used to say. But this was only the superficial direction taken
7471,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"by his energy; if he was imperious in his pleasures, he was earnest in"
7472,SOME SOLDIER POETS,his pursuit of learning; there was a singular harmony in the exercise of
7473,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the physical, intellectual, and emotional faculties at his disposal."
7474,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Julian Grenfell was a master of the body and of the mind, an unrivalled"
7475,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"boxer, a pertinacious hunter, skilled in swimming and polo, a splendid"
7476,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"shot, a swift runner, and an unwearying student. That an athlete so"
7477,SOME SOLDIER POETS,accomplished should have had time left for intellectual endowments is
7478,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"amazing, but his natural pugnacity led him to fight lexicons as he"
7479,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"fought the wild boar, and with as complete success."
7480,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7481,SOME SOLDIER POETS,The record of the brief and shining life of Julian Grenfell has been
7482,SOME SOLDIER POETS,told in an anonymous record of family life which is destined to
7483,SOME SOLDIER POETS,reverberate far beyond the discreet circle of friends to which it is
7484,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"provisionally addressed. It is a document of extraordinary candour,"
7485,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"tact, and fidelity, and it is difficult to say whether humour or courage"
7486,SOME SOLDIER POETS,is the quality which illuminates it most. It will be referred to by
7487,SOME SOLDIER POETS,future historians of our race as the most vivid record which has been
7488,SOME SOLDIER POETS,preserved of the red-blooded activity of a spirited patrician family at
7489,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the opening of the twentieth century. It is partly through his place at
7490,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the centre of this record that, as one of the most gifted of his elder"
7491,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"friends has said, the name of Julian Grenfell will be linked ""with all"
7492,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"that is swift and chivalrous, lovely and courageous,"" but it is also"
7493,SOME SOLDIER POETS,through his rare and careless verses.
7494,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7495,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Julian Grenfell, who was born to excel with an enviable ease, was not a"
7496,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"poet by determination. In a family where everything has been preserved,"
7497,SOME SOLDIER POETS,no verses of his that are not the merest boyish exercises are known to
7498,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"exist previous to the war. He was born in 1888, and he became a"
7499,SOME SOLDIER POETS,professional soldier in India in 1911. He was on his way home from South
7500,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Africa when hostilities broke out, and he was already fighting in"
7501,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Flanders in October 1914. After a very brilliant campaign, in the course"
7502,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"of which he won the D.S.O. and was twice mentioned in despatches, he was"
7503,SOME SOLDIER POETS,shot in the head near Ypres and died of his wounds at Boulogne on May
7504,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"26th, 1915. During these months in France, by the testimony of all who"
7505,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"saw him and of all to whom he wrote, his character received its final"
7506,SOME SOLDIER POETS,touch of ripeness. Among his other attainments he abruptly discovered
7507,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the gift of noble gnomic verse. On receiving news of the death of Rupert
7508,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Brooke, and a month before his own death, Julian Grenfell wrote the"
7509,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"verses called ""Into Battle,"" which contain the unforgettable stanzas:--"
7510,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7511,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""The fighting man shall from the sun"
7512,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Take warmth, and life from the glowing earth;"
7513,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Speed with the light-foot winds to run,"
7514,SOME SOLDIER POETS,And with the trees to newer birth....
7515,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7516,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""The woodland trees that stand together,"
7517,SOME SOLDIER POETS,They stand to him each one a friend;
7518,SOME SOLDIER POETS,They gently speak in the windy weather;
7519,SOME SOLDIER POETS,They guide to valley and ridge's end.
7520,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7521,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""The kestrel hovering by day,"
7522,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And the little owls that call by night,"
7523,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Bid him be swift and keen as they,"
7524,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"As keen of ear, as swift of sight."
7525,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7526,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""The blackbird sings to him 'Brother, brother,"
7527,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"If this be the last song you shall sing,"
7528,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Sing well, for you may not sing another,"
7529,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Brother, sing.'"""
7530,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7531,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"The whole of this poem is memorable, down to its final prophetic"
7532,SOME SOLDIER POETS,quatrain:--
7533,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7534,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""The thundering line of battle stands,"
7535,SOME SOLDIER POETS,And in the air Death moans and sings;
7536,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"But Day shall clasp him with strong hands,"
7537,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And Night shall fold him in soft wings."""
7538,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7539,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""Could any other man in the British Army have knocked out a heavy-weight"
7540,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"champion one week and written that poem the next?"" a brother officer"
7541,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"asked. ""Into Battle"" remains, and will probably continue to remain, the"
7542,SOME SOLDIER POETS,clearest lyrical expression of the fighting spirit of England in which
7543,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the war has found words. It is a poem for soldiers, and it gives noble"
7544,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"form to their most splendid aspirations. Julian Grenfell wrote, as he"
7545,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"boxed and rode, as he fought in the mud of Flanders, as the ideal"
7546,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"sporting Englishman of our old, heroic type."
7547,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7548,SOME SOLDIER POETS,The ancient mystery of verse is so deeply based on tradition that it is
7549,SOME SOLDIER POETS,not surprising that all the strange contrivances of twentieth-century
7550,SOME SOLDIER POETS,warfare have been found too crabbed for our poets to use. When great
7551,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Marlborough, as Addison puts it, ""examin'd all the dreadful scenes of"
7552,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"war"" at Blenheim, he was really in closer touch with Marathon than with"
7553,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the tanks and gas of Ypres. But there is one military implement so
7554,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"beautiful in itself, and so magical in the nature of its service, that"
7555,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"it is bound to conquer a place in poetry. The air-machine, to quote _The"
7556,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Campaign_ once more, ""rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm."" But"
7557,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the poets are still shy of it. In French it has, as yet, inspired but"
7558,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"one good poem, the ""Plus haut toujours!"" of Jean Allard-Méeus, a hymn of"
7559,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"real aerial majesty. In English Major Maurice Baring's ode ""In Memoriam:"
7560,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"A.H."" is equally unique, and, in its complete diversity from"
7561,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Allard-Méeus' rhapsody, suggests that the aeroplane has a wide field"
7562,SOME SOLDIER POETS,before it in the realms of imaginative writing. Major Baring's subject
7563,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"is the death of Auberon Herbert, Lord Lucas, who was killed on November"
7564,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"3rd, 1916. This distinguished young statesman and soldier had just been"
7565,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"promoted, after a career of prolonged gallantry in the air, and would"
7566,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"have flown no more, if he had returned in safety to our front on that"
7567,SOME SOLDIER POETS,fatal day.
7568,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7569,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Major Baring has long been known as an excellent composer of sonnets and
7570,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"other short pieces. But ""In Memoriam: A.H."" lifts him to a position"
7571,SOME SOLDIER POETS,among our living poets to which he had hardly a pretension. In a long
7572,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"irregular threnody or funeral ode, the great technical difficulty is to"
7573,SOME SOLDIER POETS,support lyrical emotion throughout. No form of verse is more liable to
7574,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"lapses of dignity, to dull and flagging passages. Even Dryden in _Anne"
7575,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Killigrew_, even Coleridge in the _Departing Year_, have not been able"
7576,SOME SOLDIER POETS,to avoid those languors. Many poets attempt to escape them by a use of
7577,SOME SOLDIER POETS,swollen and pompous language. I will not say that Major Baring has been
7578,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"universally successful, where the success of the great masters is only"
7579,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"relative, but he has produced a poem of great beauty and originality,"
7580,SOME SOLDIER POETS,which interprets an emotion and illustrates an incident the poignancy of
7581,SOME SOLDIER POETS,which could scarcely be exaggerated. I have no hesitation in asserting
7582,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"that ""A.H."" is one of the few durable contributions to the literature of"
7583,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the present war.
7584,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7585,SOME SOLDIER POETS,It is difficult to quote effectively from a poem which is constructed
7586,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"with great care on a complicated plan, but a fragment of Major Baring's"
7587,SOME SOLDIER POETS,elegy may lead readers to the original:--
7588,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7589,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""God, Who had made you valiant, strong and swift"
7590,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And maimed you with a bullet long ago,"
7591,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And cleft your riotous ardour with a rift,"
7592,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And checked your youth's tumultuous overflow,"
7593,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Gave back your youth to you,"
7594,SOME SOLDIER POETS,And packed in moments rare and few
7595,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Achievements manifold
7596,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And happiness untold,"
7597,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And bade you spring to Death as to a bride,"
7598,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"In manhood's ripeness, power and pride,"
7599,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And on your sandals the strong wings of youth."""
7600,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7601,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"There is no rhetoric here, no empty piling up of fine words; it is a"
7602,SOME SOLDIER POETS,closely followed study in poetical biography.
7603,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7604,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"The water has its marvels like the air, but they also have hardly yet"
7605,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"secured the attention of the poets. In _A Naval Motley_, by Lieut."
7606,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"N.M.F. Corbett, published in June 1916, we encounter the submarine:--"
7607,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7608,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""Not yours to know delight"
7609,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"In the keen hard-fought fight,"
7610,SOME SOLDIER POETS,The shock of battle and the battle's thunder;
7611,SOME SOLDIER POETS,But suddenly to feel
7612,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Deep, deep beneath the keel"
7613,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"The vital blow that rives the ship asunder!"""
7614,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7615,SOME SOLDIER POETS,A section of the new war-poetry which is particularly pathetic is that
7616,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"which is inspired by the nostalgia of home, by the longing in the midst"
7617,SOME SOLDIER POETS,of the guns and the dust and the lice for the silent woodlands and cool
7618,SOME SOLDIER POETS,waters of England. When this is combined with the sense of extreme
7619,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"youth, and of a certain brave and beautiful innocence, the poignancy of"
7620,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"it is almost more than can be borne. The judgment is hampered, and one"
7621,SOME SOLDIER POETS,doubts whether one's critical feeling can be trusted. This particular
7622,SOME SOLDIER POETS,species of emotion is awakened by no volume more than by the slender
7623,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"_Worple Flit_ of E. Wyndham Tennant, who died on the Somme in September"
7624,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"1916. He was only nineteen when he fell, at an age when, on the one"
7625,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"hand, more precocious verse than his has been written, and when yet, on"
7626,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the other, some of the greatest poets had not achieved a mastery of"
7627,SOME SOLDIER POETS,words equal to that already possessed by this young Wykehamist. The
7628,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"voice is faltering, and there is a want of sureness in the touch; the"
7629,SOME SOLDIER POETS,metrical hammer does not always tap the centre of the nail's head. But
7630,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"what pathos in the sentiment, what tenderness in the devotion to beauty!"
7631,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Tennant had, we may suppose, read Flecker before he wrote ""How shall I"
7632,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"tell you of the roads that stretch away?""; or was it merely the family"
7633,SOME SOLDIER POETS,likeness in the generation? But I know not what but his own genius can
7634,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"have inspired the ""Home Thoughts in Laventie,"" a poem about a little"
7635,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"garden left unravished among the rubble of the wrecked village, a poem"
7636,SOME SOLDIER POETS,which ends thus:--
7637,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7638,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""I saw green banks of daffodil,"
7639,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Slim poplars in the breeze,"
7640,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Great tan-brown hares in gusty March
7641,SOME SOLDIER POETS,A-courting on the leas.
7642,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And meadows, with their glittering streams--and silver-scurrying dace--"
7643,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Home, what a perfect place."""
7644,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7645,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Among these boy-poets, so cruelly and prematurely snatched from the"
7646,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"paternal earth, Tennant suggests to us the possibility that a talent of"
7647,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"very high order was quenched by death, because in few of them do we find"
7648,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"so much evidence of that ""perception and awe of Beauty"" which Plotinus"
7649,SOME SOLDIER POETS,held to be the upward path to God.
7650,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7651,SOME SOLDIER POETS,In June 1917 there was published a slender volume which is in several
7652,SOME SOLDIER POETS,ways the most puzzling and the most interesting of all that lie upon my
7653,SOME SOLDIER POETS,table to-day. This is the _Ardours and Endurances_ of Lieut. Robert
7654,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Nichols. I knew nothing of the author save what I learned from his
7655,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"writings, that he is very young, that he went out from Oxford early in"
7656,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the war, that he was fighting in Flanders before the end of 1914, that"
7657,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"he was wounded, perhaps at Loos, in 1915, and that he was long in"
7658,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"hospital. I felt the hope, which later information has confirmed, that"
7659,SOME SOLDIER POETS,he was still alive and on the road to recovery. Before _Ardours and
7660,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Endurances_ reached me, I had met with _Invocation_, a smaller volume"
7661,SOME SOLDIER POETS,published by Lieut. Nichols in December 1915. There has rarely been a
7662,SOME SOLDIER POETS,more radical change in the character of an artist than is displayed by a
7663,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"comparison of these two collections. _Invocation_, in which the war"
7664,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"takes a small and unconvincing place, is creditable, though rather"
7665,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"uncertain, in workmanship, and displays a tendency towards experiment in"
7666,SOME SOLDIER POETS,rich fancy and vague ornament. In _Ardours and Endurances_ the same
7667,SOME SOLDIER POETS,accents are scarcely to be detected; the pleasant boy has grown into a
7668,SOME SOLDIER POETS,warworn man; while the mastery over the material of poetic art has
7669,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"become so remarkable as to make the epithet ""promising"" otiose. There is"
7670,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"no ""promise"" here; there is high performance."
7671,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7672,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Alone among the poets before me, Lieut. Nichols has set down a reasoned"
7673,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"sequence of war impressions. The opening Third of his book, and by far"
7674,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"its most interesting section, consists of a cycle of pieces in which the"
7675,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"personal experience of fighting is minutely reported, stage by stage. We"
7676,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"have ""The Summons,"" the reluctant but unhesitating answer to the call in"
7677,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"England, the break-up of plans; then the farewell to home, ""the place of"
7678,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"comfort."" ""The Approach,"" in three successive lyrics, describes the"
7679,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"arrival at the Front. ""Battle,"" in eleven sections, reproduces the"
7680,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"mental and physical phenomena of the attack. ""The Dead,"" in four"
7681,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"instalments, tells the tale of grief. ""The Aftermath,"" with"
7682,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"extraordinary skill, records in eight stages the gradual recovery of"
7683,SOME SOLDIER POETS,nerve-power after the shattering emotions of the right. The first
7684,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"section of ""Battle,"" as being shorter than the rest, may be quoted in"
7685,SOME SOLDIER POETS,full as an example of Lieut. Nichols's method:--
7686,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7687,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""It is mid-day: the deep trench glares--"
7688,SOME SOLDIER POETS,A buzz and blaze of flies--
7689,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"The hot wind puffs the giddy airs,"
7690,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"The great sun rakes the skies,"
7691,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7692,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""No sound in all the stagnant trench"
7693,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Where forty standing men
7694,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Endure the sweat and grit and stench,"
7695,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Like cattle in a pen.
7696,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7697,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""Sometimes a sniper's bullet whirs"
7698,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Or twangs the whining wire;
7699,SOME SOLDIER POETS,Sometimes a soldier sighs and stirs
7700,SOME SOLDIER POETS,As in hell's forging fire.
7701,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7702,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""From out a high cool cloud descends"
7703,SOME SOLDIER POETS,An aeroplane's far moan;
7704,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"The sun strikes down, the thin cloud rends,"
7705,SOME SOLDIER POETS,The black speck travels on.
7706,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7707,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""And sweating, dizzied, isolate"
7708,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"In the hot trench beneath,"
7709,SOME SOLDIER POETS,We bide the next shrewd move of fate
7710,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Be it of life or death."""
7711,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7712,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"This is painfully vivid, but it is far exceeded in poignancy by what"
7713,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"follows. Indeed it would be difficult to find in all literature, from"
7714,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the wail of David over Jonathan downward, such an expression of the"
7715,SOME SOLDIER POETS,hopeless longing for an irrecoverable presence as informs the broken
7716,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"melodies, the stanzas which are like sobs, of the fifth section of"
7717,SOME SOLDIER POETS,_Ardours and Endurances_:--
7718,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7719,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""In a far field, away from England, lies"
7720,SOME SOLDIER POETS,A Boy I friended with a care like love;
7721,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"All day the wide earth aches, the cold wind cries,"
7722,SOME SOLDIER POETS,The melancholy clouds drive on above.
7723,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7724,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""There, separate from him by a little span,"
7725,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Two eagle cousins, generous, reckless, free,"
7726,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Two Grenfells, lie, and my Boy is made man,"
7727,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"One with these elder knights of chivalry."""
7728,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7729,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"It is difficult to qualify, it seems almost indelicate to intrude upon,"
7730,SOME SOLDIER POETS,such passionate grief. These poems form a revelation of the agony of a
7731,SOME SOLDIER POETS,spirit of superabundant refinement and native sensuousness suddenly
7732,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"stunned, and as it were momentarily petrified, by horrible spiritual"
7733,SOME SOLDIER POETS,anguish. If the strain were not relieved by the final numbers of
7734,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""Aftermath,"" where the pain of the soul is abated, and where the poet,"
7735,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"scarred and shattered, but ""free at last,"" snaps the chain of despair,"
7736,SOME SOLDIER POETS,these poems would be positively intolerable.
7737,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7738,SOME SOLDIER POETS,In the closeness of his analysis and in the accurate heaping up of exact
7739,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"and pregnant observations, Lieut. Nichols comes closer than any other of"
7740,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"these English poets to the best of the French paladins, of whom I wrote"
7741,SOME SOLDIER POETS,in _Three French Moralists_. One peculiarity which he shares with them
7742,SOME SOLDIER POETS,is his seriousness: there is no trace in him of the English cheerfulness
7743,SOME SOLDIER POETS,and levity. Most of our war-writers are incorrigible Mark Tapleys. But
7744,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Lieut. Nichols, even when he uses colloquial phrases--and he introduces"
7745,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"them with great effect--never smiles. He is most unlike the French, on"
7746,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"the other hand, in his general attitude towards the war. He has no"
7747,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"military enthusiasm, no aspiration after _gloire_. Indeed, the most"
7748,SOME SOLDIER POETS,curious feature of his poetry is that its range is concentrated on the
7749,SOME SOLDIER POETS,few yards about the trench in which he stands. He seems to have no
7750,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"national view of the purpose of the war, no enthusiasm for the cause, no"
7751,SOME SOLDIER POETS,anger against the enemy. There is but a single mention of the Germans
7752,SOME SOLDIER POETS,from beginning to end; the poet does not seem to know of their
7753,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"existence. His experiences, his agonies, his despair, are what a purely"
7754,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"natural phenomenon, such as the eruption of a volcano or the chaos of an"
7755,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"earthquake, might cause. We might read his poems over and over again"
7756,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"without forming the slightest idea of what all the distress was about,"
7757,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"or who was guilty, or what was being defended. This is a mark of great"
7758,SOME SOLDIER POETS,artistic sincerity; but it also points to a certain moral narrowness.
7759,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Lieut. Robert Nichols' ""endurances"" are magnificently described, but we"
7760,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"are left in the dark regarding his ""ardours."" We are sure of one thing,"
7761,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"however, that none of us may guess what such a talent, in one still so"
7762,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"young, may have in store for us; and we may hope for broader views"
7763,SOME SOLDIER POETS,expressed in no less burning accents.
7764,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7765,SOME SOLDIER POETS,There could hardly be a more vivid contrast than exists between the
7766,SOME SOLDIER POETS,melancholy passion of Lieut. Nichols and the fantastic high spirits of
7767,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Captain Robert Graves. He again is evidently a very young man, who was"
7768,SOME SOLDIER POETS,but yester-year a jolly boy at the Charterhouse. He has always meant to
7769,SOME SOLDIER POETS,be a poet; he is not one of those who have been driven into verse by the
7770,SOME SOLDIER POETS,strenuous emotion of the war. In some diverting prefatory lines to _Over
7771,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the Brazier_ he gives us a picture of the nursery-scene when a bright
7772,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"green-covered book bewitched him by its ""metre twisting like a chain of"
7773,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"daisies, with great big splendid words."" He has still a wholesome hunger"
7774,SOME SOLDIER POETS,for splendid words; he has kept more deliberately than most of his
7775,SOME SOLDIER POETS,compeers a poetical vocation steadily before him. He has his moments of
7776,SOME SOLDIER POETS,dejection when the first battle faces him:--
7777,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7778,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""Here's an end to my art!"
7779,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"I must die and I know it,"
7780,SOME SOLDIER POETS,With battle-murder at my heart--
7781,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"Sad death, for a poet!"
7782,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7783,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"""Oh, my songs never sung,"
7784,SOME SOLDIER POETS,And my plays to darkness blown!
7785,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"I am still so young, so young,"
7786,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"And life was my own."""
7787,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7788,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"But this mood soon passes, and is merged in the humoristic and fantastic"
7789,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"elation characteristic of this buoyant writer, whose whim it is to meet"
7790,SOME SOLDIER POETS,the tragedy not mournfully but boisterously. Where by most of the
7791,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"soldier-bards the subjective manner is a little over-done, it is"
7792,SOME SOLDIER POETS,"impossible not to welcome so objective a writer as Captain Graves, from"
7793,SOME SOLDIER POETS,whose observations of the battle of La Bassée I quote an episode:--
7794,SOME SOLDIER POETS,
7795,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER
7796,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7797,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"""We found the little captain at the head;"
7798,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,His men lay well aligned.
7799,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"We touched his hand, stone-cold, and he was dead,"
7800,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"And they, all dead behind,"
7801,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Had never reached their goal, but they died well;"
7802,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"They charged in line, and in the same line fell."
7803,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7804,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"""The well-known rosy colours of his face"
7805,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,Were almost lost in grey.
7806,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"We saw that, dying and in hopeless case,"
7807,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,For others' sake that day
7808,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,He'd smothered all rebellious groans: in death
7809,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,His fingers were tight clenched between his teeth.
7810,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7811,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"""For those who live uprightly and die true"
7812,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Heaven has no bars or locks,"
7813,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,And serves all taste.... Or what's for him to do
7814,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Up there, but hunt the fox?"
7815,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Angelic choirs? No, Justice must provide"
7816,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,For one who rode straight and at hunting died.
7817,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7818,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"""So if Heaven had no Hunt before he came,"
7819,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Why, it must find one now:"
7820,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"If any shirk and doubt they know the game,"
7821,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,There's one to teach them how:
7822,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,And the whole host of Seraphim complete
7823,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Must jog in scarlet to his opening Meet."""
7824,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7825,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,I have a notion that this is a gallant poem which Englishmen will not
7826,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,allow to be forgotten. The great quality of Captain Graves' verse at
7827,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"present is its elated vivacity, which neither fire, nor pain, nor grief"
7828,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"can long subdue. Acutely sensitive to all these depressing elements, his"
7829,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"animal spirits lift him like an aeroplane, and he is above us in a"
7830,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"moment, soaring through clouds of nonsense under a sky of unruffled"
7831,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"gaiety. In our old literature, of which he is plainly a student, he has"
7832,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"found a neglected author who is wholly to his taste. This is Skelton,"
7833,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Henry VIII's Rabelaisian laureate. Captain Graves imitates, with a great"
7834,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"deal of bravado, those breathless absurdities, _The Tunning of Elinore"
7835,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Rummyng_ and _Colin Clout_. He likes rough metre, bad rhymes and squalid"
7836,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,images: we suspect him of an inclination to be rude to his immediate
7837,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"predecessors. But his extreme modernness--""Life is a cliché--I would"
7838,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"find a gesture of my own""--is, in the case of so lively a songster, an"
7839,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"evidence of vitality. He promises a new volume, to be called _Fairies"
7840,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"and Fusiliers_, and it will be looked forward to with anticipation."
7841,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7842,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,All these poets seem to be drawn into relation to one another. Robert
7843,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Graves and Siegfried Sassoon are both Fusiliers, and they publish a"
7844,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"[Greek: stichomythia] ""on Nonsense,"" just as Cowley and Crashaw did ""on"
7845,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Hope"" two centuries and a half ago. Lieut. Sassoon's own volume is later"
7846,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"than those which we have hitherto examined, and bears a somewhat"
7847,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,different character. The gallantry of 1915 and the optimism of 1916 have
7848,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"passed away, and in Lieut. Sassoon's poems their place is taken by a"
7849,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"sense of intolerable weariness and impatience: ""How long, O Lord, how"
7850,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"long?"" The name-piece of the volume, and perhaps its first in execution,"
7851,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"is a monologue by an ignorant and shrewd old huntsman, who looks back"
7852,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"over his life with philosophy and regret. Like Captain Graves, he is"
7853,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,haunted with the idea that there must be fox-hounds in Heaven. All
7854,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,Lieut. Sassoon's poems about horses and hunting and country life
7855,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,generally betray his tastes and habits. This particular poem hardly
7856,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"touches on the war, but those which follow are absorbed by the ugliness,"
7857,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"lassitude, and horror of fighting. Lieut. Sassoon's verse has not yet"
7858,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,secured the quality of perfection; he is not sufficiently alive to the
7859,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,importance of always hitting upon the best and only word. He is
7860,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"essentially a satirist, and sometimes a very bold one, as in ""The Hero,"""
7861,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"where the death of a soldier is announced home in ""gallant lies,"" so"
7862,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,that his mother brags to her neighbours of the courage of her dead son.
7863,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"At the close of all this pious make-believe, the Colonel"
7864,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7865,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"""thought how 'Jack,' cold-footed, useless swine,"
7866,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,Had panicked down the trench that night the mine
7867,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,Went up at Wicked Corner; how he'd tried
7868,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"To get sent home; and how, at last, he died,"
7869,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Blown to small bits"";"
7870,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7871,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"or, again, as in ""Blighters,"" where the sentimentality of London is"
7872,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,contrasted with the reality in Flanders:
7873,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7874,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"""The House is crammed: tier beyond tier they grin"
7875,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"And cackle at the Show, while prancing ranks"
7876,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Of harlots shrill the chorus, drunk with din,"
7877,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,'We're sure the Kaiser loves the dear old Tanks!
7878,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7879,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"""I'd like to see a Tank come down the stalls,"
7880,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Lurching to rag-time tunes, or 'Home, sweet Home!'--"
7881,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,And there'd be no more jokes in Music-halls
7882,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"To mock the riddled corpses round Bapaume."""
7883,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7884,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"It is this note of bitter anger, miles away from the serenity of Rupert"
7885,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Brooke, the lion-heart of Julian Grenfell, the mournful passion of"
7886,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Robert Nichols, which differentiates Lieut. Sassoon from his fellows."
7887,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"They accept the war, with gallantry or with resignation; he detests it"
7888,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"with wrathful impatience. He has much to learn as an artist, for his"
7889,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"diction is often hard, and he does not always remember that Horace,"
7890,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"""when he writ on vulgar subjects, yet writ not vulgarly."" But he has"
7891,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"force, sincerity, and a line of his own in thought and fancy. A"
7892,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,considerable section of his poetry is occupied with studies of men he
7893,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"has observed at the Front, a subaltern, a private of the Lancashires,"
7894,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"conscripts, the dross of a battle-field, the one-legged man (""Thank God,"
7895,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"they had to amputate!""), the sniper who goes crazy--savage,"
7896,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,disconcerting silhouettes drawn roughly against a lurid background.
7897,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7898,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"The bitterness of Lieut. Sassoon is not cynical, it is the rage of"
7899,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"disenchantment, the violence of a young man eager to pursue other aims,"
7900,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"who, finding the age out of joint, resents being called upon to help to"
7901,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"mend it. His temper is not altogether to be applauded, for such"
7902,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"sentiments must tend to relax the effort of the struggle, yet they can"
7903,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,hardly be reproved when conducted with so much honesty and courage.
7904,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Lieut. Sassoon, who, as we learn, has twice been severely wounded and"
7905,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"has been in the very furnace of the fighting, has reflected, more"
7906,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"perhaps than his fellow-singers, about the causes and conditions of the"
7907,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"war. He may not always have thought correctly, nor have recorded his"
7908,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"impressions with proper circumspection, but his honesty must be"
7909,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,respectfully acknowledged.
7910,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7911,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"I have now called attention to those soldier-writers of verse who, in my"
7912,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"judgment, expressed themselves with most originality during the war."
7913,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"There is a temptation to continue the inquiry, and to expatiate on"
7914,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,others of only less merit and promise. Much could be said of Charles
7915,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Hamilton Sorley, who gave evidence of precocious literary talent, though"
7916,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"less, I think, in verse, since the unmistakable singing faculty is"
7917,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"absent in _Marlborough_ (Cambridge University Press, 1916), than in"
7918,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"prose, a form in which he already excelled. Sorley must have shown"
7919,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"military gifts as well as a fine courage, for when he was killed in"
7920,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"action in October 1915, although he was but twenty years of age, he had"
7921,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"been promoted captain. In the universal sorrow, few figures awaken more"
7922,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"regret, than his. Something, too, had I space, should be said about the"
7923,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,minstrels who have been less concerned with the delicacies of
7924,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,workmanship than with stirring the pulses of their auditors. In this
7925,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"kind of lyric ""A Leaping Wind from England"" will long keep fresh the"
7926,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"name of W.N. Hodgson, who was killed in the battle of the Somme. His"
7927,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,verses were collected in November 1916. The strange rough drum-taps of
7928,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Mr. Henry Lawson, published in Sydney at the close of 1915, and those of"
7929,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"Mr. Lawrence Rentoul, testify to Australian enthusiasm. Most of the"
7930,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"soldier-poets were quite youthful; an exception was R.E. Vernède, whose"
7931,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"_War Poems_ (W. Heinemann, 1917) show the vigour of moral experience. He"
7932,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"was killed in the attack on Harrincourt, in April 1917, having nearly"
7933,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,closed his forty-second year. To pursue the list would only be to make
7934,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,my omissions more invidious.
7935,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,
7936,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,There can be no healthy criticism where the principle of selection is
7937,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"neglected, and I regret that patriotism or indulgence has tempted so"
7938,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,many of those who have spoken of the war-poets of the day to plaster
7939,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"them with indiscriminate praise. I have here mentioned a few, in whose"
7940,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,honour even a little excess of laudation may not be out of place. But
7941,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"these are the exceptions, in a mass of standardised poetry made to"
7942,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"pattern, loosely versified, respectable in sentiment, uniformly"
7943,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"meditative, and entirely without individual character. The reviewers who"
7944,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"applaud all these ephemeral efforts with a like acclaim, and who say"
7945,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,that there are hundreds of poets now writing who equal if they do not
7946,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"excel the great masters of the past, talk nonsense; they talk nonsense,"
7947,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,and they know it. They lavish their flatteries in order to widen the
7948,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"circle of their audience. They are like the prophets of Samaria, who"
7949,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,declared good unto the King of Israel with one mouth; and we need a
7950,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,Micaiah to clear the scene of all such flatulent Zedekiahs. It is not
7951,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,true that the poets of the youngest generation are a myriad Shelleys and
7952,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,Burnses and Bérangers rolled into one. But it is true that they carry on
7953,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,"the great tradition of poetry with enthusiasm, and a few of them with"
7954,THE DEAD FOX HUNTER,high accomplishment.

7969,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
7970,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
7971,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,In venturing this afternoon to address an audience accustomed to listen
7972,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"to those whose positive authority is universally recognised, and in"
7973,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"taking for my theme a subject not, like theirs, distinct in its"
7974,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"definitions or consecrated by tradition and history, I am aware that I"
7975,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"perform what you may, if you choose, call an act of blameworthy"
7976,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"audacity. My subject is chimerical, vague, and founded on conjectures"
7977,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,which you may well believe yourselves at least as well fitted as I am to
7978,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"propound. Nevertheless, and in no rash or paradoxical spirit, I invite"
7979,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,you to join with me in some reflections on what is the probable course
7980,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of English poetry during, let us say, the next hundred years. If I"
7981,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"happen to be right, I hope some of the youngest persons present will"
7982,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"say, when I am long turned to dust, what an illuminating prophet I was."
7983,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"If I happen to be wrong, why, no one will remember anything at all about"
7984,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the matter. In any case we may possibly be rewarded this afternoon by
7985,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,some agreeable hopes and by the contemplation of some pleasant
7986,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,analogies.
7987,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
7988,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Our title takes for granted that English poetry will continue, with"
7989,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"whatever fluctuations, to be a living and abiding thing. This I must"
7990,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"suppose that you all accede to, and that you do not look upon poetry as"
7991,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"an art which is finished, or the harvest of classic verse as one which"
7992,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,is fully reaped and garnered. That has been believed at one time and
7993,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"another, in various parts of the globe. I will mention one instance in"
7994,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the history of our own time: a quarter of a century ago, the practice of"
7995,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,writing verse was deliberately abandoned in the literatures of the three
7996,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Scandinavian countries, but particularly in that of Norway, where no"
7997,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"poetry, in our sense, was written from about 1873 to 1885. It almost"
7998,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,died out here in England in the middle of the fifteenth century; it ran
7999,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,very low in France at the end of the Middle Ages. But all these
8000,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"instances, whether ancient or modern, of the attempt to prove prose a"
8001,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,sufficing medium for all expression of human thought have hitherto
8002,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"failed, and it is now almost certain that they will more and more"
8003,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"languidly be revived, and with less and less conviction."
8004,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8005,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,It was at one of the deadliest moments in the life of the art in England
8006,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"that George Gascoigne remarked, in his _Epistle to the Reverend Divine_"
8007,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"(1574) that ""It seemeth unto me that in all ages Poetry hath been not"
8008,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"only permitted, but also it hath been thought a right good thing."""
8009,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Poetry has occupied the purest and the fieriest minds in all ages, and"
8010,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"you will remember that Plato, who excluded the poets from his"
8011,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"philosophical Utopia, was nevertheless an exquisite writer of lyrical"
8012,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"verse himself. So, to come down to our own day, Ibsen, who drove poetry"
8013,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"out of the living language of his country, had been one of the most"
8014,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,skilful of prosodical proficients. Such instances may allay our alarm.
8015,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,There cannot be any lasting force in arguments which remind us of the
8016,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,pious confessions of a redeemed burglar. It needs more than the zeal of
8017,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,a turncoat to drive Apollo out of Parnassus.
8018,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8019,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"There will, therefore, we may be sure, continue to be English poetry"
8020,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,written and printed. Can we form any idea of the probable character of
8021,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"it? There exists, in private hands, a picture by that ingenious"
8022,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"water-colour painter of the late eighteenth century, William Gilpin. It"
8023,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"is very fantastic, and means what you like, but it represents Pegasus,"
8024,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the horse of the Muses, careering in air on the vast white arc of his"
8025,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"wings, against a sky so dark that it must symbolise the obscure"
8026,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,discourse of those who write in prose. You are left quite doubtful
8027,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,whether he will strike the rocky terrace in the foreground with his
8028,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"slender, silver hooves, or will swoop down into the valley below, or"
8029,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,will soar to heaven and out of sight. You are left by the painter in a
8030,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"pleasant uncertainty, but Hippocrene may break out anywhere, and of the"
8031,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,vivacious courser himself all that we can be sure of is that we are
8032,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,certain to see him alighting before us when we least expect him.
8033,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8034,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,We may put our trust in the persistence of Pegasus through his
8035,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"apparently aimless gyrations, and in the elasticity of the poetical"
8036,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"spirit, and yet acknowledge that there are difficulties in the way of"
8037,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,believing that verse will continue to be written in the English language
8038,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,for a quite indefinite period. Perhaps we may as well face one or two of
8039,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"these difficulties at once. The principal danger, then, to the future of"
8040,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,poetry seems to me to rest in the necessity of freshness of expression.
8041,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Every school of verse is a rising and a breaking wave. It rises, because"
8042,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,its leaders have become capable of new forms of attractive expression;
8043,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"its crest is some writer, or several writers, of genius, who combine"
8044,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,skill and fire and luck at a moment of extreme opportuneness; and then
8045,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the wave breaks, because later writers cannot support the ecstasy, and"
8046,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,merely repeat formulas which have lost their attractiveness. Shirley
8047,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"would have been a portent, if he had flourished in 1595 and had written"
8048,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,then as he did in 1645. Erasmus Darwin would be one of the miracles of
8049,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,prosody if _The Loves of the Plants_ could be dated 1689 instead of
8050,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"1789. There must always be this fluctuation, this rise and fall in"
8051,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"value, and what starts each new wave mounting out of the trough of the"
8052,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,last is the instinctive demand for freshness of expression. _Cantate
8053,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Domino_ is the cry of youth, sing a _new_ song unto the Lord."
8054,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8055,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"But with the superabundant circulation of language year after year, week"
8056,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"after week, by a myriad careful scribes, the possibilities of freshness"
8057,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"grow rarer and rarer. The obvious, simple, poignant things seem to have"
8058,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"all been said. It is not merely that the actual poems, like Gray's"
8059,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"_Elegy_, and much of _Hamlet_, and some of Burns's songs, have been"
8060,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"manipulated so often, and put to such pedestrian uses, that they are"
8061,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"like rubbed coins, and begin to lose the very features of Apollo and the"
8062,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"script of the Muses, but that the road seems closed to future bards who"
8063,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,wish to speak with simplicity of similar straightforward things. In
8064,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"several of the literatures of modern Europe--those which began late, or"
8065,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,struggled long against great disadvantages--it is still possible to
8066,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,produce pleasure by poems which describe primitive emotions in perfectly
8067,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"limpid language. But with us in England, I confess that it seems to me"
8068,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"certain that whatever we retain, we can never any more have patience to"
8069,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,listen to a new shepherd piping under the hawthorn-tree. Each generation
8070,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,is likely to be more acutely preoccupied than the last with the desire
8071,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"for novelty of expression. Accordingly, the sense of originality, which"
8072,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"is so fervently demanded from every new school of writers, will force"
8073,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the poets of the future to sweep away all recognised impressions. The
8074,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"consequence must be, I think--I confess so far as language is concerned"
8075,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,that I see no escape from this--that the natural uses of English and the
8076,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"obvious forms of our speech will be driven from our national poetry, as"
8077,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,they are even now so generally being driven.
8078,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8079,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"No doubt, in this condition, the originality of those who do contrive to"
8080,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,write strongly and clearly will be more vigorously evident than ever.
8081,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,The poets will have to gird up their loins and take their sword in their
8082,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"hands. That wise man of the eighteenth century, to whom we never apply"
8083,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"without some illuminating response, recommends that ""Qui saura penser de"
8084,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"lui-même et former de nobles idées, qu'il prenne, s'il pent, la manière"
8085,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"et le tour élevé des maîtres."" These are words which should inspire"
8086,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"every new aspirant to the laurel. ""S'il peut""; you see that Vauvenargues"
8087,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"puts it so, because he does not wish that we should think that such"
8088,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"victories as these are easy, or that any one else can help us to produce"
8089,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"them. They are not easy, and they will be made more and more hard by the"
8090,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"rubbed-out, conventionalised coinage of our language."
8091,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8092,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,In this matter I think it probable that the little peoples and the
8093,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"provinces which cultivate a national speech, will long find a great"
8094,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,facility in expressing themselves in verse. I observe that it has
8095,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"recently been stated that Wales, which has always teemed with vernacular"
8096,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"poets, has never possessed so many as she does at this time. I am"
8097,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"debarred by what Keats called ""giant ignorance"" from expressing an"
8098,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"opinion on the subject, but I presume that in Welsh the resources of"
8099,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,language are far from being so seriously exhausted as we have seen that
8100,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"they are in our own complicated sphere, where the cultivation of all the"
8101,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,higher forms of poetic diction through five centuries has made simple
8102,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,expression extremely difficult. I am therefore ready to believe that in
8103,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Welsh, as in Gaelic and in Erse, the poets have still wide fields of"
8104,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"lyric, epic, and dramatic art untilled. We have seen, in the latter half"
8105,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of the nineteenth century, Provençal poets capable of producing simple"
8106,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,and thrilling numbers which are out of the reach of their sophisticated
8107,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,brethren who employ the worn locutions of the French language.
8108,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8109,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"In new generations there is likely, we may be sure, to occur less"
8110,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"description of plain material objects, because the aspect of these has"
8111,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,already received every obvious tribute. So also there can hardly fail to
8112,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"be less precise enumeration of the primitive natural emotions, because"
8113,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"this also has been done already, and repeated to satiety. It will not"
8114,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,any longer satisfy to write
8115,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8116,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"""The rose is red, the violet blue,"
8117,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"And both are sweet, and so are you."""
8118,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8119,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Reflections of this order were once felt to be exquisite, and they were"
8120,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,so still as lately as when Blake and Wordsworth were young. But it is
8121,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,quite impossible that we should ever go back to them. Future poets will
8122,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"seek to analyse the redness of the rose, and will scout, as a fallacious"
8123,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"observation, the statement that the violet is blue. All schemes of art"
8124,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"become mechanical and insipid, and even their _naïvetés_ lose their"
8125,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"savour. Verse of excellent quality, in this primitive manner, can now be"
8126,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,written to order by any smart little boy in a Grammar-school.
8127,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8128,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"We have agreed, however, to believe that poetry, as an art, in one shape"
8129,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"or another, will escape from the bankruptcy of language, and that"
8130,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Pegasus, with whatever strange and unexpected gambollings, will continue"
8131,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"to accompany us. But of one thing we may be quite sure, that it will"
8132,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,only be at the cost of much that we at present admire and enjoy that the
8133,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,continuity of the art of verse will be preserved. If I could suddenly
8134,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,present to you some characteristic passages of the best English poetry
8135,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of 1963, I doubt extremely whether I should be able to persuade you of"
8136,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,their merit. I am not sure that you would understand what the poet
8137,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"intended to convey, any more than the Earl of Surrey would have"
8138,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"understood the satires of Donne, or Coleridge have enjoyed the odes of"
8139,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,George Meredith. Young minds invariably display their vitality by
8140,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"attacking the accepted forms of expression, and then they look about"
8141,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"for novelties, which they cultivate with what seems to their elders to"
8142,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"be extravagance. Before we attempt to form an idea, however shadowy, of"
8143,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"what poetry will be in the future, we must disabuse ourselves of the"
8144,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,delusion that it will be a repetition of what is now produced and
8145,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,accepted. Nor can we hope by any exercise of philosophy to do away with
8146,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the embarrassing and painful, but after all perhaps healthful antagonism"
8147,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,between those who look forward and those who live in the past. The
8148,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,earnestness expended on new work will always render young men incapable
8149,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,of doing justice to what is a very little older than themselves; and the
8150,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,piety with which the elderly regard what gave them full satisfaction in
8151,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,their days of emotional freshness will always make it difficult for them
8152,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,to be just to what seems built on the ruins of what they loved.
8153,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8154,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,If there is any feature which we can scarcely be wrong in detecting in
8155,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,our vision of the poetry of the future it is an elaboration which must
8156,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,follow on the need for novelty of which I have spoken. I expect to find
8157,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the modern poet accepting more or less consciously an ever-increasing
8158,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"symbolic subtlety of expression. If we could read his verses, which are"
8159,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"still unwritten, I feel sure that we should consider them obscure. That"
8160,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"is to say, we should find that in his anxiety not to repeat what had"
8161,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"been said before him, and in his horror of the trite and the"
8162,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"superficial, he will achieve effect and attach interest _obscuris vera"
8163,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"involvens_--wrapping the truth in darkness. The ""darkness"" will be"
8164,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"relative, as his own contemporaries, being more instructed and"
8165,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"sophisticated than we are, will find those things transparent, or at"
8166,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"least translucent, which remain opaque enough to us. And, of course, as"
8167,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,epithets and adjectives that seem fresh to us will smell of the inkhorn
8168,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"to him, he will have to exert his ingenuity to find parallel"
8169,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,expressions which would startle us by their oddity if we met with them
8170,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,now.
8171,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8172,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"A danger, therefore, which the poets of the future will need all their"
8173,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"ingenuity to avoid, will be the cultivation of a patent artificiality, a"
8174,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,forcing of the note until it ceases to rouse an echo in the human heart.
8175,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,There will be a determination to sweep away all previously recognised
8176,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"impressions. Affectation, that is to say the obtaining of an effect by"
8177,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"illegitimate means, is an offence against the Muses which they never"
8178,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,fail to avenge by oblivion or by a curtailed and impeded circulation. We
8179,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,may instructively examine the history of literature with special
8180,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"attention to this fault, and we find it in all cases to have been fatal."
8181,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"It was fatal to the poetry of Alexandria, which closed, as you know, in"
8182,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,an obscurity to which the title of Lycophrontic darkness has been given
8183,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,from the name of its most extravagant exponent. It was fatal to several
8184,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"highly-gifted writers of the close of the Elizabethan period, who"
8185,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,endeavoured to give freshness to an outworn scheme of poetic ornament; I
8186,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"need only remind you of the impenetrable cloud or fog, by Cyril"
8187,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Tourneur, called _The Transform'd Metamorphosis_, and of the cryptic"
8188,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"rhymed dramas of Lord Brooke. It has not been fatal, I hope, but I think"
8189,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"desperately perilous to a beautiful talent of our own age, the amiable"
8190,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Stéphane Mallarmé. Nothing, I feel, is more dangerous to the health of"
8191,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,poetry than the praise given by a group of irresponsible disciples to
8192,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"verse which transfers commonplace thought to an exaggerated, violent,"
8193,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"and involved scheme of diction, and I confess that I should regard the"
8194,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"future of poetry in this country with much more apprehension than I do,"
8195,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"if I believed that the purely learned poet, the prosodical pedant, was"
8196,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"destined to become paramount amongst us. That would, indeed, threaten"
8197,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the permanence of the art; and it is for this reason that I look with a
8198,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,certain measure of alarm on the excess of verbiage about versification
8199,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,which attends not merely criticism--for that matters little--but the
8200,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"actual production and creation. I am confident, however, that the common"
8201,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,sense of readers will always bring about a reaction in favour of sanity
8202,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,and lucidity.
8203,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8204,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,One great objection to the introduction of a tortured and affected style
8205,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,into verse-writing is the sacrifice which has to be made of that dignity
8206,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"and sweetness, that suave elevation, which marks all successful"
8207,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,masterpieces. Perhaps as difficult a quality to attain as any which the
8208,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"poetry of the future will be called upon to study is stateliness, what"
8209,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the French call ""la vraie hauteur."" This elevation of style, this"
8210,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"dignity, is foreign to democracies, and it is hard to sustain it in the"
8211,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"rude air of modern life. It easily degenerates, as Europe saw it"
8212,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"degenerate for a century and a half, into pomposity relieved by"
8213,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"flatness. It is apt to become a mere sonorous rhetoric, a cultivation of"
8214,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,empty fine phrases. If we examine the serious poetry of the end of the
8215,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,seventeenth and the greater part of the eighteenth century--especially
8216,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"in the other countries of Europe, for England was never without some dew"
8217,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"on the threshing-floor--if we examine it in France, for instance,"
8218,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"between Racine and André Chenier, we are obliged to recognise that it"
8219,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"was very rarely both genuine and appropriate. The Romantic Revival,"
8220,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"which we are beginning ungratefully to decry, did at least restore to"
8221,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"poetry the sense of a genuine stateliness of expression, which once more"
8222,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"gave it the requisite dignity, and made it a vehicle for the vital and"
8223,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the noble sentiments of humanity.
8224,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8225,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Let us now turn, in our conjectural survey, from the form to the"
8226,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,subjects with which the poetry of the future is likely to be engaged.
8227,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Here we are confronted with the fact that, if we examine the whole of"
8228,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"history, we see that the domain of verse has been persistently narrowed"
8229,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,by the incursions of a more and more powerful and wide embracing prose.
8230,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,At the dawn of civilisation poetry had it all its own way. If
8231,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"instruction was desired upon any sphere of human knowledge or energy,"
8232,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the bard produced it in a prosodical shape, combining with the dignity"
8233,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,of form the aid which the memory borrowed from a pattern or a song. Thus
8234,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"you conceive of a Hesiod before you think of a Homer, and the earliest"
8235,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"poetry was probably of a purely didactic kind. As time went on, prose,"
8236,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"with its exact pedestrian method, took over more and more completely the"
8237,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"whole province of information, but it was not until the nineteenth"
8238,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,century that the last strongholds of the poetry of instruction were
8239,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"stormed. I will, if you please, bring this home to you by an example"
8240,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,which may surprise you.
8241,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8242,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,The subject which I have taken the liberty of discussing with you this
8243,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,afternoon has not often occupied the serious attention of critics. But
8244,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"it was attempted, by no less a person than Wordsworth, more than a"
8245,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,hundred years ago. I make no excuse for repeating to you the remarkable
8246,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,passage in which he expressed his convictions in the famous Preface of
8247,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,1800:--
8248,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8249,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"""If the labours of men of science,--Wordsworth said,--should ever"
8250,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"create any material revolution, direct or indirect, in our"
8251,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"condition, and in the impressions which we habitually receive, the"
8252,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,Poet will sleep then no more than at present; he will be ready to
8253,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"follow the steps of the Man of Science, not only in those general"
8254,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"indirect effects, but he will be at his side, carrying sensation"
8255,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,into the midst of the objects of the science itself. The remotest
8256,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"discoveries of the Chemist, the Botanist, or Mineralogist, will be"
8257,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,as proper objects of the Poet's art as any upon which it can be
8258,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"employed, if the time should ever come when these things shall be"
8259,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"familiar to us, and the relations under which they are contemplated"
8260,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"by the followers of these respective sciences, thus familiarised"
8261,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"to men, shall be ready to put on, as it were, a form of flesh and"
8262,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"blood, the Poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the"
8263,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"transfiguration, and will welcome the Being thus produced, as a"
8264,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"dear and genuine inmate of the household of man."""
8265,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8266,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"It is plain, then, that, writing in the year 1800, Wordsworth believed"
8267,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,that a kind of modified and sublimated didactic poetry would come into
8268,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,vogue in the course of the nineteenth century. He stood on the threshold
8269,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of a new age, and he cast his vatic gaze across it much in the same"
8270,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,spirit as we are trying to do to-day. But if any warning were needed to
8271,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"assure us of the vanity of prophesying, it would surely be the error of"
8272,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,one so sublimely gifted and so enriched with the spoils of meditation.
8273,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"The belief of Wordsworth was that the poetry of the future would deal,"
8274,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"in some vaguely inspired fashion, with the discoveries of science. But"
8275,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"when we look back over the field of 113 years, how much do we find our"
8276,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,national poetry enriched with ore from the mines of mineralogy or botany
8277,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,or chemistry? It is difficult to see that there has been so much as an
8278,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,effort made to develop poetry in this or in any similar direction.
8279,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,Perhaps the nearest approach to what Wordsworth conceived as probable
8280,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"was attempted by Tennyson, particularly in those parts of _In Memoriam_"
8281,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,where he dragged in analogies to geological discoveries and the
8282,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"biological theories of his time. Well, these are just those parts of"
8283,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,Tennyson which are now most universally repudiated as lifeless and
8284,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,jejune.
8285,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8286,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,Wordsworth did not confine himself to predicting a revival of didactic
8287,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"poetry, the poetry of information, such as, in a very crude form, had"
8288,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"prevailed all over Europe in his own childhood, but he conceived a wide"
8289,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,social activity for writers of verse. He foresaw that the Poet would
8290,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"""bind together by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human"
8291,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"society, as it is spread over the whole earth, and over all time."" I"
8292,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"suppose that in composing those huge works, so full of scattered"
8293,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"beauties, but in their entirety so dry and solid, _The Excursion_ and"
8294,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"_The Prelude_, he was consciously attempting to inaugurate this scheme"
8295,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,of a wide and all-embracing social poetry. Nor do I suppose that efforts
8296,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,of this kind will ever cease to be made. We have seen a gifted writer in
8297,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,whom the memory is perhaps even more surprisingly developed than the
8298,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"imagination, employ the stores of his experience to enrich a social"
8299,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"poetry the elements of which, prima facie, should be deeply attractive"
8300,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,to us all. But I do not know that the experiments of Mr. Rudyard
8301,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Kipling, brilliant as they are, are calculated to encourage the poets of"
8302,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the future to pursue their lyric celebration of machinery and sociology
8303,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,and the mysteries of natural religion. Already is it not that portion of
8304,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"his work which we approach with most languor, in spite of its"
8305,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"originality and its outlook upon ""the vast empire of human society""? And"
8306,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,lesser poets than he who seek for popularity by such violent means are
8307,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"not, I think, rewarded by the distinguished loyalty of the best readers."
8308,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"We are startled by their novelty, and we admire them for the moment; but"
8309,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"when, a few years later, we return to them, we are apt to observe with"
8310,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,distress how
8311,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8312,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"""their lean and flashy songs"
8313,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw."""
8314,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8315,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"If, therefore, I venture upon a prophecy, where all the greater"
8316,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"prophets, my predecessors, have failed, it is to suggest that the energy"
8317,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,of future poets will not be largely exercised on themes of this intrepid
8318,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"social character, but that as civilisation more and more tightly lays"
8319,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"hold upon literature, and excludes the purest form of it from one"
8320,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"province after another, poetry will, in its own defence, cultivate more"
8321,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"and more what Hazlitt calls ""a mere effusion of natural sensibility."""
8322,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Hazlitt used the phrase in derision, but we may accept it seriously, and"
8323,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,not shrink from adopting it. In most public remarks about current and
8324,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"coming literature in the abstract, I marvel at the confidence with which"
8325,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,it is taken for granted that the sphere of interest occupied by writers
8326,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,of the imagination is sure to grow wider and wider. It is expected to
8327,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"embrace the world, to take part in a universal scheme of pacification,"
8328,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"to immortalise imperial events, to be as public as possible. But surely"
8329,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,it is more and more clearly proved that prose is the suitable medium for
8330,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,such grandiose themes as these. Within the last year our minds have been
8331,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,galvanised into collective sympathy by two great sensations of
8332,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"catastrophe, each case wearing the most thrilling form that tragedy can"
8333,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,take in the revolt of nature against the feverish advances of mankind. I
8334,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,suppose we may consider the destruction of the Titanic and the loss of
8335,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,Captain Scott's expedition as two absolutely typical examples of what is
8336,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,thought by journalists to be fitting material for poetry. Yet by common
8337,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"consent, these tragic occurrences did not awaken our numerous poets to"
8338,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"any really remarkable effort, lyrical or elegiac. No ode or threnody"
8339,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,could equal in vibrating passion Captain Scott's last testament. These
8340,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,are matters in which the fullness of a wholly sincere statement in prose
8341,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"does not require, does not even admit, the introduction of the symbol."
8342,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,The impact of the sentiments of horror and pity is too sudden and
8343,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,forcible.
8344,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8345,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"My own view is that, whether to its advantage or not, the poetry of the"
8346,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"future is likely to be very much occupied with subjects, and with those"
8347,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"alone, which cannot be expressed in the prose of the best-edited"
8348,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"newspaper. In fact, if I were to say what it is which I think coming"
8349,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"poets will have more and more to be on their guard against, I should"
8350,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,define it as a too rigid determination never to examine subjects which
8351,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,are of collective interest to the race at large. I dread lest the
8352,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"intense cultivation of the Ego, in minutest analysis and microscopical"
8353,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"observation of one's self, should become the sole preoccupation of the"
8354,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,future poet. I will not tell you that I dread lest this should be one of
8355,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"his principal preoccupations, for that would be to give way to a cheery"
8356,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,piece of mid-Victorian hypocrisy which would be unworthy of you and of
8357,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,me alike. The time is past when intelligent persons ought to warn
8358,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"writers of the imagination not to cultivate self-analysis, since it is"
8359,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the only safeguard against the follies of an unbridled romanticism. But
8360,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"although the ivory tower offers a most valuable retreat, and although"
8361,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the poets may be strongly recommended to prolong their _villeggiatura_
8362,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"there, it should not be the year-long habitation of any healthy"
8363,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,intelligence.
8364,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8365,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"I do not question that the closing up of the poetic field, the depending"
8366,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"more and more completely for artistic effect upon an ""effusion of"
8367,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"natural sensibility,"" will isolate the poet from his fellows. He will be"
8368,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"tempted, in the pursuit of the symbol which illustrates his emotion, to"
8369,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,draw farther and farther away from contact with the world. He will wrap
8370,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"his singing-robes not over his limbs only, but over his face, and treat"
8371,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"his readers with exemplary disdain. We must be prepared, or our"
8372,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"successors must, to find frequently revealed the kind of poet who not"
8373,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"merely sees nothing superior to himself, but nothing except himself. I"
8374,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,am not concerned to say that this will be unfortunate or blameworthy;
8375,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the moralist of the future must attend to that. But I can believe that
8376,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,this unyielding and inscrutable attitude may produce some fine artistic
8377,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,effects. I can believe that both intensity and dignity may be gained by
8378,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"this sacrifice of the plainer human responsibilities, although I am not"
8379,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,prepared to say at what loss of other qualities. It is clear that such a
8380,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,writer will not allow the public to dictate to him the nature or form of
8381,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"his lyric message, and he will have to depend for success entirely on"
8382,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the positive value of his verse.
8383,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8384,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,The isolation of the poets of the future is likely to lead them to band
8385,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,themselves more closely together for mutual protection against the
8386,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,reasonable world. The mystery of verse is like other abstruse and
8387,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,recondite mysteries--it strikes the ordinary fleshly man as absurd. The
8388,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"claim of the poet on human sympathy, if we regard it merely from the"
8389,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"world's standpoint, is gratuitous, vague, and silly. In an entirely"
8390,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"sensible and well-conducted social system, what place will there be for"
8391,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the sorrows of Tasso and Byron, for the rage of Dante, for the"
8392,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"misanthropy of Alfred de Vigny, for the perversity of Verlaine, for the"
8393,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"rowdiness of Marlowe?--the higher the note of the lyre, the more"
8394,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"ridiculous is the attitude of the lyrist, and the coarse public applauds"
8395,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the violence of Diogenes when he tramples on the pride of the poets with
8396,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,a greater pride than theirs. I cannot help thinking that this attitude
8397,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of the sacred bard, maundering from the summit of his ivory tower, and"
8398,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"hollowed out and made haggard by a kind of sublime moral neuralgia, will"
8399,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,have to be abandoned as a relic of the dead romantic past. So far as it
8400,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,is preserved by the poets of the future it will be peculiar to those
8401,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"monasteries of song, those ""little clans,"" of which I am now about to"
8402,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,speak as likely more and more to prevail.
8403,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8404,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"In France, where the interest in poetry has, during the last generation,"
8405,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"been far more keen and more abundant than anywhere else in the world, we"
8406,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,already see a tendency to the formation of such experimental houses of
8407,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,song. There has been hitherto no great success attending any one of
8408,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"these bodies, which soon break up, but the effort to form them is"
8409,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,perhaps instructive. I took considerable interest in the Abbaye de
8410,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Creteil, which was a collectivist experiment of this kind. It was"
8411,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"founded in October 1906, and it was dissolved in consequence of internal"
8412,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"dissensions in January 1908. It was an attempt to create, in defiance"
8413,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of the public, in contemptuous disregard of established ""literary"
8414,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"opinion,"" a sort of prosodical chapel or school of poetry. It was to be"
8415,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the active centre of energy for a new generation, and there were five"
8416,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"founders, each of whom was highly ambitious to distinguish himself in"
8417,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"verse. At Creteil there was a printing-press in a great park, so that"
8418,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,the members should be altogether independent of the outside world. The
8419,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,poets were to cultivate the garden and keep house with the sale of the
8420,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"produce. When not at work, there were recitations, discussions,"
8421,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"exhibitions of sketches, for they were mixed up with the latest vagaries"
8422,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,of the Cubists and Post-impressionists.
8423,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8424,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"This particular experiment lasted only fifteen months, and I cannot"
8425,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,conscientiously say that I think it was in any way a success. No one
8426,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"among the abbatical founders of Creteil had, to be quite frank, any"
8427,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,measure of talent in proportion to his daring. They were involved in
8428,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"vague and nebulous ideas, mixed up with what I am afraid I must call"
8429,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"charlatans, the refuse and the wreckage of other arts. Yet I consider"
8430,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,that it is interesting to note that the lay monks of Creteil were in a
8431,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"sense correct when they announced that they were performing ""a heroic"
8432,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"act,"" an act symbolical of the way in which poetry would in the future"
8433,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"disdainfully protect itself against the invasion of common sense, the"
8434,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"dreadful impact of the sensual world. I think you will do well, if you"
8435,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"wish to pursue the subject of our conjectural discourse, to keep your"
8436,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,eye on this tendency to a poetical collectivism. We have not noticed
8437,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"much evidence of it yet in England, but it is beginning to stir a good"
8438,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"deal in France and Italy. After all, the highest poetry is a mysterious"
8439,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"thing, like the practices of the Society of Rosicrucians, of whom it was"
8440,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"said, ""Our House of the Holy Ghost, though a hundred thousand men should"
8441,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"have looked upon it, is yet doomed to remain untouched, imperturbable,"
8442,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"out of sight, and unrevealed to the whole godless world for ever."" If I"
8443,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"am sure of anything, it is that the Poets of the Future will look upon"
8444,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"massive schemes of universal technical education, and such democratic"
8445,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,reforms as those which are now occupying the enthusiasm and energy of
8446,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Lord Haldane, as peculiarly hateful expositions of the godlessness of a"
8447,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,godless world.
8448,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8449,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"To turn to another branch of our subject, it appears to me possible that"
8450,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,sexual love may cease to be the predominant theme in the lyrical poetry
8451,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,of the future. Erotic sentiment has perhaps unduly occupied the
8452,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"imaginative art of the past. In particular, the poets of the late"
8453,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,nineteenth century were interested to excess in love. There was a sort
8454,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of obsession of sex among them, as though life presented no other"
8455,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"phenomenon worthy of the attention of the artist. All over Europe, with"
8456,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the various tincture of differing national habit and custom, this was"
8457,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the mark of the sophistication of the poets, sometimes delicately and"
8458,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"craftily exhibited, but often, as in foreign examples which will easily"
8459,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"occur to your memory, rankly, as with the tiresome persistence of a"
8460,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"slightly stale perfume, an irritating odour of last night's opopanax or"
8461,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"vervain. And this is the one point, almost I think the only point, in"
8462,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,which the rather absurd and certainly very noisy and hoydenish
8463,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"manifestoes of the so-called Futurists, led by M. Marinetti and his crew"
8464,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of iconoclasts, are worthy of our serious attention. It is a plank in"
8465,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"their platform to banish eroticism, of the good kind and of the bad,"
8466,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"from the poetic practice of the future. I do not, to say the truth, find"
8467,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"much help for the inquiry we have taken up to-day, in the manifestoes of"
8468,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"these raucous young gentlemen, who, when they have succeeded in flinging"
8469,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the ruins of the architecture of Venice into its small stinking canals,"
8470,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,will find themselves hard put to it to build anything beautiful in the
8471,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"place of them. But in their reaction against ""the eternal feminine,"""
8472,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"they may, I think, very possibly be followed by the serious poets of the"
8473,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,future.
8474,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8475,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,Those who have watched rather closely the recent developments of poetry
8476,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,in England have been struck with the fact that it tends more and more in
8477,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the direction of the dramatic, not necessarily in the form of what is"
8478,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"known as pure drama, particularly adapted for representation to"
8479,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"listening audiences behind the footlights, but in the increased study of"
8480,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,life in its exhibitions of energy. This may seem to be inconsistent with
8481,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the tendency, of which I spoke just now, to withdraw from the world"
8482,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"itself, either into an egotistical isolation or into some cloistered"
8483,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,association of more or less independent figures united only in a
8484,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,rebellious and contemptuous disdain of public opinion. But the
8485,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,inconsistency may very well be one solely in appearance. It may well
8486,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,happen that the avoidance of all companionship with the stereotyped
8487,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"social surfaces of life, the ignorance--really, the happy and hieratic"
8488,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"ignorance--of what ""people"" in the fussy sense, are supposed to be"
8489,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"saying and doing, may actually help the poet to come more fruitfully and"
8490,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"penetratingly to what lies under the surface, to what is essential and"
8491,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"permanent and notable in the solid earth of human character. Hence, I"
8492,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,think it not improbable that the poetry of the future may become more
8493,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"and more dramatic, although perhaps by a series of acts of definite"
8494,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"creation, rather than as the result of observation, which will be left"
8495,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,to the ever-increasing adroitness of the brilliant masters of our prose.
8496,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8497,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"As a result of this obsession in creative drama, I suppose that we may"
8498,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,expect to find in the poetry of the future a more steady hope for
8499,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,mankind than has up to the present time been exhibited. The result of an
8500,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"excessive observation of the startling facts of life, a work appropriate"
8501,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"to the violent energy of realistic prose, has been a general"
8502,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"exaggeration of the darker tints, an insistence on that prominence of"
8503,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"what was called the ""sub-fusc"" colours which art-critics of a century"
8504,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"ago judged essential to sublimity in all art. In Continental literature,"
8505,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"and particularly in the very latest Russian drama, this determination to"
8506,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"see blackness and blackness only, to depict the ordinary scene of"
8507,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"existence as a Valley of the Shadow of Despair, has been painfully"
8508,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"frequent. In England we had a poet of considerable power, whose tragic"
8509,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"figure crossed me in my youth, in whose work there is not a single gleam"
8510,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of hope or dignity for man;--I mean the unfortunate James Thomson,"
8511,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,author of _The City of Dreadful Night_. I cannot but believe that the
8512,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"poetry of the future, being more deeply instructed, will insist less"
8513,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,emphatically upon human failure and less savagely upon the revolt of
8514,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"man. I anticipate in the general tone of it an earnestness, a fullness"
8515,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of tribute to the noble passion of life, an utterance simple and direct."
8516,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,I believe that it will take as its theme the magnificence of the
8517,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"spectacle of Man's successful fight with Nature, not the grotesque and"
8518,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,squalid picturesqueness of his occasional defeat.
8519,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8520,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"It has been admirably said, in a charming essay, that ""History may be"
8521,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"abstract, science may be frankly inhuman, even art may be purely formal;"
8522,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"but poetry must be full of human life."" This consideration, I think, may"
8523,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,make us feel perfectly secure as to the ultimate maintenance of poetic
8524,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"expression. For humanity will always be with us, whatever changes may be"
8525,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"introduced into our social system, whatever revolutions may occur in"
8526,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"religion, in legality, in public order, or in the stratification of"
8527,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,composite life. I confess the only atmosphere in which it is impossible
8528,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,for me to conceive of poetry as able to breathe would be one of complete
8529,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"and humdrum uniformity of existence, such as was dreamed of at one time,"
8530,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"but I think is no longer so rigidly insisted on, by extreme socialistic"
8531,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,reformers. As long as there is such variety of individual action
8532,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"possible as will give free scope to the energies and passions, the"
8533,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"hopes and fears, of mankind, so long I think the element of plastic"
8534,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,imagination will be found to insist on expression in the mode of formal
8535,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"art. It is quite possible that, as a result of extended knowledge and of"
8536,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the democratic instinct, a certain precipitant hardness of design, such"
8537,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,as was presented in the nineteenth century by Tennyson in the blank
8538,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"verse lyrics in _The Princess_, by Browning in the more brilliant parts"
8539,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of _One Word More_, by Swinburne in his fulminating _Sapphics_, may be"
8540,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,as little repeated as the analogous hardness of Dryden in _MacFlecknoe_
8541,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"or the lapidary splendour of Gray in his _Odes_. I should rather look,"
8542,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"at least in the immediate future, for a revival of the liquid ease of"
8543,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,Chaucer or the soft redundancies of _The Faerie Queene_. The remarkable
8544,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"experiments of the Symbolists of twenty years ago, and their effect upon"
8545,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the whole body of French verse, leads me to expect a continuous movement"
8546,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,in that direction.
8547,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8548,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,It is difficult indeed to speak of the probable future of poetry without
8549,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"introducing the word Symbolism, over which there has raged so much windy"
8550,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,warfare in the immediate past. I cannot help believing that the immense
8551,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,importance of this idea is one of the principal--perhaps the greatest
8552,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,discovery with regard to poetry which was made in the last generation.
8553,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Symbols, among the ancient Greeks, were, if I mistake not, the signs by"
8554,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,which the initiated worshippers of Ceres or Cybele recognised their
8555,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"mysterious unison of heart. A symbol is an indication of an object, in"
8556,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,opposition to a direct description of the same; it arouses the idea of
8557,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"it in the awakened soul; rings a bell, for we may almost put it so,"
8558,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,which at once rouses the spirit and reminds it of some special event or
8559,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,imminent service. The importance of making this the foremost feature of
8560,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"poetry is not new, although it may be said that we have only lately, and"
8561,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"only partially, become aware of its value. But, really, if you will"
8562,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"consider it, all that the Symbolists have been saying is involved in"
8563,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Bacon's phrase that ""poetry conforms the shows of things to the desires"
8564,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"of the soul, instead of subjecting the soul to external things."" There"
8565,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,could never be presented a subject less calculated to be wound up with a
8566,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,rhetorical flourish or to close in pompous affirmation than that which I
8567,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,have so temerariously brought before you this afternoon. I hope that you
8568,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"will not think that your time has been wasted while we have touched,"
8569,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"lightly and erratically, like birds on boughs, upon some of the probable"
8570,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"or possible features of the poetry of the future. Whatever you, or I, or"
8571,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"the wisest of professors, may predict on this theme of the unborn poets,"
8572,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,we may be certain that there will
8573,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,
8574,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"""hover in their restless heads"
8575,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"One thought, one grace, one wonder, at the least,"
8576,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"Which into words no virtue"""

8579,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"in the air, flashing and curvetting, petulantly refusing to alight on"
8580,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"any expected spot. Let me return to it in closing, that I may suggest"
8581,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,our only sage attitude to be one of always watching for his inevitable
8582,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,"arrival, ready to put grateful lips to the waters of Hippocrene as soon"
8583,HENRI DE RÉGNIER.,as ever they bubble from the blow of his hoof.

8601,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,willing to distinguish what was good from what was bad in the time of
8602,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,their grandmothers. With increasing audacity they repudiate the
8603,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Victorian Age as a _sæclum insipiens et infacetum_, and we meet"
8604,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"everywhere with the exact opposite of Montaigne's ""Je les approuve tous"

8607,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,they are told it is Victorian.
8608,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8609,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,This may almost be described as an intellectual and moral revolution.
8610,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Every such revolution means some liberation of the intellect from
8611,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"bondage, and shows itself first of all in a temper of irreverence; the"
8612,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,formulas of the old faith are no longer treated with respect and
8613,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,presently they are even ridiculed. It is useless to close our eyes to
8614,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the fact that a spirit of this kind is at work amongst us, undermining"
8615,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the dignity and authority of objects and opinions and men that seemed
8616,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,half a century ago to be more perennial than bronze. Successive orators
8617,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"and writers have put the public in possession of arguments, and"
8618,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"especially have sparkled in pleasantries, which have sapped the very"
8619,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"foundations of the faith of 1850. The infection has attacked us all, and"
8620,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"there is probably no one who is not surprised, if he seriously reflects,"
8621,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,to realise that he once implicitly took his ideas of art from Ruskin and
8622,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,of philosophy from Herbert Spencer. These great men are no longer
8623,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,regarded by anybody with the old credulity; their theories and their
8624,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"dogmas are mined, as were those of the early eighteenth century in"
8625,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"France by the Encyclopædists, by a select class of destructive critics,"
8626,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,in whose wake the whole public irregularly follows. The ordinary
8627,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"unthinking man accepts the change with exhilaration, since in this"
8628,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,country the majority have always enjoyed seeing noses knocked off
8629,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,statues. But if we are to rejoice in liberation from the bondage of the
8630,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Victorian Age we ought to know what those bonds were.
8631,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8632,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,The phenomena of the decadence of an age are never similar to those of
8633,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,its rise. This is a fact which is commonly overlooked by the opponents
8634,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,of a particular section of social and intellectual history. In the
8635,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"initial stages of a ""period"" we look for audacity, fire, freshness,"
8636,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,passion. We look for men of strong character who will hew a channel
8637,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,along which the torrent of new ideals and subversive sentiments can
8638,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"rush. But this violence cannot be expected to last, and it would lead to"
8639,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"anarchy if it did. Slowly the impetus of the stream diminishes, the"
8640,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"river widens, and its waters reach a point where there seems to be no"
8641,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,further movement in their expanse. No age contains in itself the
8642,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"elements of endless progress; it starts in fury, and little by little"
8643,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the force of it declines. Its decline is patent--but not until long
8644,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"afterwards--in a deadening of effort, in a hardening of style. Dryden"
8645,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"leads on to Pope, Pope points down to Erasmus Darwin, after whom the"
8646,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,world can but reject the whole classical system. The hungry sheep of a
8647,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"new generation look up and are not fed, and this is the vision which"
8648,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,seems to face us in the last adventures of the schools of yesterday.
8649,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8650,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"But what is, or was, the Victorian Age? The world speaks glibly of it as"
8651,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,though it were a province of history no less exactly defined than the
8652,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,career of a human being from birth to death; but in practice no one
8653,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"seems in a hurry to mark out its frontiers. Indeed, to do so is an"
8654,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"intrepid act. If the attempt is to be made at all, then 1840, the year"
8655,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"of Queen Victoria's marriage with Prince Albert, may be suggested as the"
8656,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"starting-point, and 1890 (between the death-dates of Browning, Newman,"
8657,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,and Tennyson) as the year in which the Victorian Age is seen sinking
8658,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"into the sands. Nothing could be vaguer, or more open to contention in"
8659,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"detail, than this delineation, but at all events it gives our"
8660,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"deliberations a frame. It excludes _Pickwick_, which is the typical"
8661,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"picture of English life under William IV., and _Sartor Resartus_, which"
8662,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,was the tossing of the bound giant in his sleep; but it includes the
8663,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"two-volume Tennyson, ""chiefly lyrical,"" the stir of the Corn Law"
8664,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"agitation, the Tractarian Crisis of 1841, and the _History of the French"
8665,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Revolution and Past and Present_, when the giant opened his eyes and"
8666,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,fought with his chains. Darwin was slowly putting together the notes he
8667,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"had made on the Beagle, and Hugh Miller was disturbing convention by his"
8668,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"explorations of the Old Red Sandstone. Most of all, the discussion of"
8669,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,permanent and transient elements in Christianity was taking a foremost
8670,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"place in all strata of society, not merely in the form of the contest"
8671,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"around _Tract 90_, but in the divergent directions of Colenso, the"
8672,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Simeon Evangelicals, and Maurice."
8673,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8674,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,The Victorian Age began in rancour and turmoil. This is an element which
8675,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"we must not overlook, although it was in a measure superficial. A series"
8676,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"of storms, rattling and recurrent tempests of thunder and lightning,"
8677,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"swept over public opinion, which had been so calm under George IV. and"
8678,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,so dull under William IV. Nothing could exceed the discord of
8679,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"vituperation, the Hebraism of Carlyle denouncing the Vaticanism of"
8680,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Wiseman, ""Free Kirk and other rubbish"" pitted against ""Comtism,"
8681,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"ghastliest of algebraic spectralities."" This theological tension marks"
8682,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the first twenty years and then slowly dies down, after the passion"
8683,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,expended over _Essays and Reviews_. It was in 1840 that we find
8684,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Macaulay, anxious to start a scheme of Whig reform and to cut a"
8685,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"respectable figure as Secretary of State for War, unable to get to"
8686,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,business because of the stumbling-block of religious controversy.
8687,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Everything in heaven and earth was turned into ""a theological treatise,"""
8688,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"and all that people cared about was ""the nature of the sacraments, the"

8690,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"regeneration."" The sitting member goes down to Edinburgh to talk to his"

8695,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8696,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"If the Victorian Age opened in a tempest of theology, it was only"
8697,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,natural that it should cultivate a withering disdain for those who had
8698,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,attempted to reform society on a non-theological basis. In sharp
8699,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,contradistinction to the indulgence of the Georgian period for
8700,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"philosophic speculation, England's interest in which not even her long"
8701,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"continental wars had been able to quench, we find with the accession of"
8702,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Victoria the credit of the French thinkers almost abruptly falling.
8703,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Voltaire, never very popular in England, becomes ""as mischievous a"
8704,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"monkey as any of them""; the enthusiasm for Rousseau, which had reached"
8705,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"extravagant proportions, completely disappears, and he is merely the"
8706,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"slanderous sceptic, who, after soaking other people's waistcoats with"
8707,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"his tears, sent his own babies to the Foundling Hospital. The influence"
8708,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,of the French eighteenth-century literature on the mind of England was
8709,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,first combated and then baldly denied. The premier journalist of the age
8710,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"declared, with the satisfaction of a turkey-cock strutting round his"
8711,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"yard, that no trace of the lowest level of what could be called"
8712,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"popularity remained in England to the writers of France, and he felt"
8713,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"himself ""entitled to treat as an imbecile conceit the pretence"" that a"
8714,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,French school of thought survived in Great Britain. Such was the
8715,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Podsnappery of the hour in its vigilance against moral and religious
8716,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,taint.
8717,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8718,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Notwithstanding, or perhaps we ought to say inevitably conducted by"
8719,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"these elements of passion and disdain, the infant Victorian Age passed"
8720,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"rapidly into the great political whirlpool of 1846, with its violent"
8721,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,concentration of enthusiasm on the social questions which affected the
8722,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"welfare of the masses, with, in short, its tremendous upheaval of a"
8723,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,practical radicalism. From that time forth its development baffles
8724,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"analysis. Whatever its present enemies may allege to its discredit, they"
8725,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,cannot pretend that it was languid or monotonous. No Age hitherto lived
8726,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,out upon the world's surface has been so multiform or so busy; none
8727,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,defies the art of the historian to such a bewildering degree. Its latest
8728,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,critic does not exaggerate when he says that our fathers and our
8729,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,grandfathers have poured forth and accumulated so vast a quantity of
8730,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"information concerning it ""that the industry of a Ranke would be"
8731,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"submerged by it and the perspicacity of a Gibbon would quail before it."""
8732,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"This is manifestly true, and it is evident that an encyclopædia would be"
8733,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,required to discuss all the divisions of so tremendous a subject. If we
8734,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,look over too wide a horizon we lose our bearings altogether. We get a
8735,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,hopelessly confused notion of the course of progress; we see
8736,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"experiments, criticisms, failures, but who is to assure us what was the"
8737,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,tendency of evolution?
8738,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8739,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Mr. Lytton Strachey's ""Eminent Victorians"" has arrived at the very"
8740,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"moment when all readers are prepared to discuss the age he deals with,"
8741,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,and when public opinion is aware of the impatience which has been
8742,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"""rising in the bosom of a man like smoke"" under the pressure of the"
8743,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,insistent praise of famous men. The book has attracted a very remarkable
8744,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,degree of notice; it has been talked about wherever people have met
8745,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,together; and has received the compliment of being seriously displayed
8746,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,before the University of Oxford by one of the most eminent of the
8747,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Victorian statesmen whom Oxford has produced. If we look into the causes
8748,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"of this success, enjoyed by the earliest extended book of a writer"
8749,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"almost unknown, a book, too, which pretends to no novelty of matter or"
8750,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"mystery of investigation, we find them partly in the preparedness of the"
8751,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"public mind for something in the way of this exposure, but partly also"
8752,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,in the skill of the writer. Whatever else may be said of Mr. Lytton
8753,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Strachey, no one can deny that he is very adroit, or that he possesses"
8754,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the art of arresting attention.
8755,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8756,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"It is part of this adroitness that he contrives to modify, and for a"
8757,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,long time even to conceal the fact that his purpose is to damage and
8758,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"discredit the Victorian Age. He is so ceremonious in his approach, so"
8759,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"careful to avoid all brusqueness and coarseness, that his real aim may"
8760,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"be for awhile unobserved. He even professes to speak ""dispassionately,"
8761,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"impartially, and without ulterior intentions."" We may admit the want of"
8762,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"passion and perhaps the want of partiality, but we cannot avoid seeing"
8763,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the ulterior intention, which is to undermine and belittle the"
8764,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,reputation of the great figures of the Victorian Age. When the
8765,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"prodigious Signor Marinetti proposes to hurl the ""leprous palaces"" of"
8766,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"his native city into her ""fetid canals,"" and to build in their place"
8767,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"warehouses and railway stations, he does not differ in essential"
8768,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"attitude from Mr. Lytton Strachey, delicately ""laying bare the facts of"
8769,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"some cases."" The only real difference consists in the finer tact, the"
8770,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"greater knowledge of history--in short, the superior equipment of the"
8771,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,English iconoclast. Each of them--and all the troop of opponents who
8772,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,grumble and mutter between their extremes--each of them is roused by an
8773,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"intense desire to throw off the shackles of a dying age, in which they"
8774,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"have taught themselves chiefly to see affectation, pomposity, a"
8775,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"virtuosity more technical than emotional, and an exasperating monotony"
8776,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,of effect.
8777,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8778,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Mr. Strachey has conducted his attack from the point of view of
8779,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,biography. He realises the hopelessness of writing a history of the
8780,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Victorian Age; it can only be dealt with in detail; it must be nibbled
8781,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,into here and there; discredited piecemeal; subjected to the ravages of
8782,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the white ant. He has seen that the lives of the great Victorians lend
8783,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"themselves to this insidious kind of examination, because what was worst"
8784,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,in the pretentiousness of their age is to be found enshrined in the
8785,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Standard Biographies (in two volumes, post octavo) under which most of"
8786,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,them are buried. Mr. Strachey has some criticism of these monsters which
8787,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,could hardly be bettered:
8788,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8789,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"""Those two fat volumes, with which it is our custom to commemorate"
8790,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the dead--who does not know them, with their ill-digested masses of"
8791,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"material, their slipshod style, their tone of tedious panegyric,"
8792,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"their lamentable lack of selection, of detachment, of design? They"
8793,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"are as familiar as the cortège of the undertaker, and bear the same"
8794,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"air of slow, funereal barbarism."""
8795,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8796,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,It is impossible not to agree with this pungent criticism. Every candid
8797,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,reader could point to a dozen Victorian biographies which deserve Mr.
8798,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Strachey's condemnation. For instance, instead of taking up any of the"
8799,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"specimens which he has chosen for illustration, we need only refer the"
8800,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"reader's memory to the appendix of ""Impressions,"" by a series of elderly"
8801,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"friends, which closes the official _Life of Tennyson_, published in"
8802,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,1897. He will find there an expression of the purest Victorian optimism.
8803,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,The great object being to foist on the public a false and superhuman
8804,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"picture of the deceased, a set of illustrious contemporaries--who"
8805,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"themselves expected to be, when they died, transfigured in like"
8806,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,manner--form a bodyguard around the corpse of the poet and emit their
8807,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"""tedious panegyric."" In this case, more even than in any of the"
8808,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"instances which Mr. Strachey has taken, the contrast between the real"
8809,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,man and the funereal image is positively grotesque.
8810,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8811,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Without question this contrast is not a little responsible for the
8812,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,discredit into which the name of Tennyson has fallen. Lord Selborne
8813,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"found nothing in Tennyson ""inconsistent with the finest courtesy and the"
8814,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"gentlest heart."" Dr. Jowett had preserved through forty years ""an"
8815,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"ever-increasing wonder at the depth of his thought,"" and emphatically"
8816,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"stated that he ""was above such feelings as a desire of praise, or fear"
8817,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"of blame."" (Tennyson, who was thirsty for ceaseless laudation, and to"
8818,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,whom a hint of censure was like the bite of a mosquito!) Frederick Myers
8819,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"ejaculated, ""How august, how limitless a thing was Tennyson's own"
8820,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"spirit's upward flight!"" The Duke of Argyll, again, during the space of"
8821,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"forty years, had found him ""always reverent, hating all levity or"
8822,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"flippancy,"" and was struck by his possessing ""the noblest humility I"
8823,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"have ever known."" Lord Macaulay, who ""had stood absolutely aloof,"" once"
8824,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"having been permitted to glance at the proof-sheets of _Guenevere_, was"
8825,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"""absolutely subdued"" to ""unfeigned and reverent admiration."" The duke"
8826,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"was the glad emissary who was ""the medium of introduction,"" and he"
8827,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"recognised in Macaulay's subjugation ""a premonition"" of Tennyson's"
8828,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"complete ""conquest over the living world and over the generations that"
8829,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"are to come."""
8830,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8831,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Thus the priesthood circled round their idol, waving their censers and"
8832,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"shouting their hymns of praise, while their ample draperies effectively"
8833,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,hid from the public eye the object which was really in the centre of
8834,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"their throng, namely, a gaunt, black, touzled man, rough in speech,"
8835,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"brooding like an old gipsy over his inch of clay pipe stuffed with shag,"
8836,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"and sucking in port wine with gusto--""so long as it is black and sweet"
8837,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"and strong, I care not!"" Their fault lay, not in their praise, which was"
8838,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"much of it deserved, but in their deliberate attempt in the interests of"
8839,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,what was Nice and Proper--gods of the Victorian Age--to conceal what any
8840,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,conventional person might think not quite becoming. There were to be no
8841,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"shadows in the picture, no stains or rugosities on the smooth bust of"
8842,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,rosy wax.
8843,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8844,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"On the pretext, therefore, of supplying a brief and above all a"
8845,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"complimentary set of portraits, Mr. Strachey takes the biography of an"
8846,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"ecclesiastic, an educational authority, a woman of action, and a man of"
8847,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"adventure, and tells them over again in his own way. The four figures he"
8848,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"chooses are all contemporary, and yet, so implacably does time hurry us"
8849,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"along, all would be very old if they still survived. Three of them could"
8850,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"hardly survive, for Cardinal Manning and Dr. Arnold would be far over a"
8851,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"hundred, and Florence Nightingale in her ninety-ninth year; the fourth,"
8852,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"General Gordon, would be eighty-five. The motto of Mr. Strachey is ""Put"
8853,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"not your trust in the intellectual princes of the Victorian Age,"" or, at"
8854,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"least, in what their biographers have reported of them; they were not"
8855,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"demi-gods in any sense, but eccentric and forceful figures working dimly"
8856,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"towards aims which they only understood in measure, and which very"
8857,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,often were not worth the energy which they expended on them. This
8858,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,attitude alone would be enough to distinguish Mr. Strachey from the
8859,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"purveyors of indiscriminate praise, and in adopting it he emphasises his"
8860,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,deliberate break with the age of which they were the envy and the
8861,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"ornament. Given his 1918 frame of mind, no blame can attach to him for"
8862,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,adopting this gesture. At moments when the tradition of a people has
8863,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,been violently challenged there have always ensued these abrupt acts of
8864,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,what to the old school seems injustice. If Mr. Lytton Strachey is
8865,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"reproached with lack of respect, he might reply: In the midst of a"
8866,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"revolution, who is called on to be respectful to the fallen monarch?"
8867,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Extreme admiration for this or that particular leader, the principle of"
8868,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Victorian hero-worship, is the very heresy, he might say, which I have"
8869,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,set out to refute.
8870,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8871,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,When St. John the Divine addressed his Apocalypse to the Angels of the
8872,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Seven Churches, he invented a system of criticism which is worthy of all"
8873,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,acceptation. He dwelt first upon the merits of each individual church;
8874,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,not till he had exhausted them did he present the reverse of the coin.
8875,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"In the same spirit, critics who, in the apostle's phrase, have"
8876,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"""something against"" Mr. Lytton Strachey, will do well to begin by"
8877,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"acknowledging what is in his favour. In the first place, he writes"
8878,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"sensibly, rapidly, and lucidly--without false ornament of any kind. Some"
8879,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"of his pages might, with advantage, be pinned up opposite the"
8880,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,writing-tables of our current authors of detestable pseudo-Meredithian
8881,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,and decayed Paterese. His narrative style is concise and brisk. His book
8882,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,may undoubtedly best be compared among English classics with _Whiggism
8883,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"in its Relations to Literature_, although it is less discursive and does"
8884,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,not possess the personal element of that vivacious piece of polemic. In
8885,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,this recurrence of Mr. Strachey to a pellucid stream of prose we see an
8886,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"argument against his own theory of revolt. The procedure of the arts,"
8887,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the mechanical tricks of the trade, do they really improve or decline"
8888,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"from age to age? Are they not, in fact, much more the result of"
8889,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,individual taste than of fashion? There seems to be no radical change in
8890,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the methods of style. The extravagant romanticism of rebellion against
8891,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the leaders of the Victorian Age finds at length an exponent, and behold"
8892,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"he writes as soberly as Lord Morley, or as Newman himself!"
8893,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8894,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"The longest of these biographies is that of Cardinal Manning, and it is"
8895,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the one with which Mr. Lytton Strachey has taken most pains. Briefer
8896,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"than the briefest of the _English Men of Letters_ series of biographies,"
8897,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"it is yet conducted with so artful an economy as to give the impression,"
8898,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"to an uninstructed reader, that nothing essential about the career of"
8899,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Manning has been omitted. To produce this impression gifts of a very
8900,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"unusual order were required, since the writer, pressed on all sides by a"
8901,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"plethora of information, instead of being incommoded by it, had to seem"
8902,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"to be moving smoothly in an atmosphere of his own choosing, and to be"
8903,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,completely unembarrassed by his material. He must have the air of
8904,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"saying, in Froude's famous impertinence, ""This is all we know, and more"
8905,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"than all, yet nothing to what the angels know."" In the face of a whole"
8906,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"literature of controversy and correspondence, after a storm of Purcell"
8907,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"and Hutton, Ward and Mozley and Liddon tearing at one another's throats,"
8908,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Mr. Lytton Strachey steps delicately on to the stage and says, in a low"
8909,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"voice, ""Come here and I will tell you all about a funny ecclesiastic who"
8910,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"had a Hat, and whose name was Henry Edward Manning. It will not take us"
8911,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"long, and ever afterwards, if you hear that name mentioned, you will"
8912,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"know everything about him which you need to remember."" It is audacious,"
8913,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"and to many people will seem shocking, but it is very cleverly done."
8914,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8915,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,The study of Florence Nightingale is an even better example of Mr.
8916,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Strachey's method, since she is the one of his four subjects for whom he"
8917,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"betrays some partiality. ""The Miss Nightingale of fact was not as facile"
8918,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"fancy painted her,"" and it has greatly entertained Mr. Strachey to chip"
8919,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the Victorian varnish off and reveal the iron will beneath. His first
8920,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,chapter puts it in one of his effective endings:--
8921,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8922,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"""Her mother was still not quite resigned; surely Florence might at"
8923,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"least spend the summer in the country. At this, indeed, among her"
8924,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"intimates, Mrs. Nightingale almost wept. 'We are ducks,' she said"
8925,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"with tears in her eyes, 'who have hatched a wild swan.' But the"
8926,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"poor lady was wrong; it was not a swan that they had hatched, it"
8927,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"was an eagle."""
8928,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8929,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"It is therefore as an eagle, black, rapacious, with hooked bill and"
8930,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"crooked talons, that he paints Miss Nightingale; and the Swan of"
8931,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Scutari, the delicate Lady with the Lamp, fades into a fable. Mr."
8932,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Strachey glorifies the demon that possessed this pitiless, rushing"
8933,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,spirit of philanthropy. He gloats over its ravages; its irresistible
8934,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,violence of purpose. It is an evident pleasure to him to be able to
8935,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"detach so wild a figure from the tameness of the circumambient scene,"
8936,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"and all his enmity to the period comes out in the closing pages, in"
8937,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,which he describes how the fierce philanthropist lived so long that the
8938,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Victorian Age had its revenge upon her, and reduced her, a smiling, fat"
8939,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"old woman, to ""compliance and complacency."" It is a picture which will"
8940,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"give much offence, but it is certainly extremely striking, and Mr."
8941,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Strachey can hardly be accused of having done more than deepen the
8942,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,shadows which previous biographers had almost entirely omitted.
8943,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8944,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"In this study, if the author is unusually indulgent to his subject, he"
8945,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,is relatively severer than usual to the surrounding figures. To some of
8946,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"them, notably to Arthur Hugh Clough, he seems to be intolerably unjust."
8947,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"On the other hand, to most of those public men who resisted the work of"
8948,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Florence Nightingale it is difficult to show mercy. Mr. Strachey is so
8949,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"contemptuous, almost so vindictive, in his attitude to Lord Panmure,"
8950,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,that the reader is tempted to take up the cudgels in defence of an
8951,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"official so rudely flouted. But, on reflection, what is there that can"
8952,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,be said in palliation of Lord Panmure? He was the son of a man of whom
8953,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"his own biographer has admitted that ""he preserved late into the"
8954,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,[nineteenth] century the habits and passions--scandalous and
8955,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"unconcealed--which had, except in his case, passed away. He was devoted"
8956,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"to his friends so long as they remained complaisant, and violent and"
8957,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,implacable to all who thwarted him.--His uncontrollable temper alienated
8958,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,him from nearly all his family in his latter years. In private life he
8959,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"was an immovable despot."""
8960,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8961,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"This was the father of Fox Maule, second Baron Panmure, of whom Mr."
8962,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Strachey has so much to say. Evidently he was a Regency type, as the son"
8963,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"was a Victorian. Determined not to resemble his father, Fox Maule early"
8964,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"became a settled and industrious M.P., and in 1846 Lord John Russell"
8965,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,made him Secretary of War. He held the same post under Lord Palmerston
8966,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,from 1855 to 1858. Nothing could dislodge him from office; not even the
8967,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"famous despatch ""Take care of Dawb"" could stir him. In 1860 he became"
8968,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"eleventh Earl of Dalhousie. He died two years later, having enjoyed"
8969,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"every distinction, even that of President of the Royal Military Asylum."
8970,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"He was ""unco guid,"" as pious as his father had been profane, but he had"
8971,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,no social or political or intellectual merit of any kind which can at
8972,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,this distance of time be discerned. Florence Nightingale called him the
8973,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Bison, and his life's energy seems to have been expended in trying,"
8974,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"often with success, to frustrate every single practical reform which"
8975,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,she suggested. To the objection that Mr. Strachey has depicted the
8976,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"heroine as ""an ill-tempered, importunate spinster, who drove a statesman"
8977,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"to his death,"" he might conceivably reply that if history, grown calm"
8978,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"with the passage of years, does so reveal her, it is rather absurd to go"
8979,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,on idealising her. Why not study the real Eagle in place of the fabulous
8980,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Swan? It is difficult to condemn Mr. Strachey along this line of
8981,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,argument.
8982,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
8983,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,The early Victorians liked what was definable and tangible; they were
8984,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"""ponderous mechanists of style."" Even in their suggestions of change"
8985,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"they preserved an impenetrable decorum of demeanour, a studied progress,"
8986,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,a deep consciousness of the guiding restraint of tradition upon
8987,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,character. Their preoccupation with moral ideas tinged the whole of
8988,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"their surroundings, their literature, their art, their outlook upon"
8989,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"life. That the works of Mr. Charles Dickens, so excruciatingly funny,"
8990,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,should have been produced and appreciated in the midst of this intense
8991,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"epoch of exhortation seems a paradox, till we recollect how careful"
8992,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Dickens is, when his laughter is loudest, never to tamper with ""the deep"
8993,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"sense of moral evil."" This apprehension of the rising immorality of the"
8994,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"world, against which the only rampart was the education of ""a thorough"
8995,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"English gentleman, Christian, manly and enlightened"" was dominant in no"
8996,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"spirit more than in that of Mr. Thomas Arnold, of whom Mr. Strachey"
8997,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"gives a somewhat deterrent portrait. It is deterrent, because we have"
8998,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"passed, in three-quarters of a century, completely out of the atmosphere"
8999,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,in which Dr. Arnold moved and breathed. We are not sure that Mr.
9000,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Strachey acted very wisely in selecting Dr. Arnold for one of his four
9001,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"subjects, since the great schoolmaster was hardly a Victorian at all."
9002,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,When he entered the Church George III. was on the throne; his
9003,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,accomplishment at Rugby was started under George IV.; he died when the
9004,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Victorian Age was just beginning. He was a forerunner, but hardly a"
9005,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,contemporary.
9006,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9007,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Although in his attitude to the great Rugby schoolmaster Mr. Strachey
9008,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"shows more approbation than usual, this portrait has not given universal"
9009,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,satisfaction. It has rather surprisingly called forth an indignant
9010,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,protest from Dr. Arnold's granddaughter. Yet such is the perversity of
9011,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the human mind that the mode in which Mrs. Humphry Ward ""perstringes"""
9012,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the biographer brings us round to that biographer's side. For Mrs. Ward
9013,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"has positively the indiscretion, astounding in a writer of her learning"
9014,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"and experience, to demand the exclusion of irony from the legitimate"
9015,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,weapons of the literary combatant. This is to stoop to sharing one of
9016,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the meanest prejudices of the English commonplace mind, which has always"
9017,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"resented the use of that delicate and pointed weapon. Moreover, Mrs."
9018,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Ward does not merely adopt the plebeian attitude, but she delivers"
9019,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,herself bound hand and foot to the enemy by declaring the use of irony
9020,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"to be ""unintelligent."" In support of this amazing statement she quotes"
9021,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,some wandering phrase of Sainte-Beuve. By the light of recent
9022,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"revelations, whether Sainte-Beuve was ironical or not, he was certainly"
9023,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"perfidious. But, to waive that matter, does Mrs. Humphry Ward consider"
9024,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"that Swift and Lucian and Machiavelli were, as she puts it, ""doomed to"
9025,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"failure"" because they used irony as a weapon? Was Heine and is Anatole"
9026,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"France conspicuous for want of intelligence? And, after all, ought not"
9027,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Mrs. Ward to remember that if she had a very serious grandfather, she"
9028,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"had a still more celebrated uncle, who wrote _Friendship's Garland_?"
9029,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9030,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,While no one else will seriously blame Mr. Strachey for employing irony
9031,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"in his investigation of character, the subject leads on to what may be"
9032,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,regarded as a definite fault in his method. A biographer should be
9033,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"sympathetic; not blind, not indulgent, but _sympathetic_. He should be"
9034,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"able to enter into the feelings of his subjects, and be anxious to do"
9035,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"so. It is in sympathy, in imaginative insight, that Mr. Strachey fails."
9036,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,His personages are like puppets observed from a great height by an
9037,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,amiable but entirely superior intelligence. The peculiar aim of Mr.
9038,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Strachey, his desire to lower our general conception of the Victorian"
9039,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Age, tempts him to exaggerate this tendency, and he succumbs to the"
9040,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"temptation. His description of Lord Acton at Rome in 1870--""he despised"
9041,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Lord Acton almost as much as he disliked him""--is not ironic, it is"
9042,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,contemptuous. Arthur Hugh Clough presents no aspect to Mr. Strachey but
9043,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,that of a timid and blundering packer-up of parcels; one might conceive
9044,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,that the biographer had never contemplated the poet in any other
9045,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"capacity than, with sealing-wax in his hand and string between his lips,"
9046,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,shuddering under the eye of Miss Nightingale. The occasional references
9047,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"to Lord Wolseley suggest an unaccountable hurrying figure of pygmy size,"
9048,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,which Mr. Strachey can only just discern. This attitude of hovering
9049,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,superiority is annoying.
9050,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9051,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,But it reaches a more dangerous importance when it affects spiritual
9052,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"matters. The author interests himself, from his great height, in the"
9053,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"movements of his Victorian dwarfs, and notices that they are"
9054,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"particularly active, and prone to unusual oddity of movement, when they"
9055,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,are inspired by religious and moral passion. Their motions attract his
9056,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"attention, and he describes them with gusto and often with wit. His"
9057,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,sketch of Rome before the Oecumenical Council is an admirably studied
9058,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,page. Miss Nightingale's ferocity when the War Office phalanx closed its
9059,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,ranks is depicted in the highest of spirits; it is impossible not to be
9060,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,riveted by the scene round Cardinal Manning's death-bed; but what did
9061,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,those manifestations mean? To Mr. Strachey it is evident that the fun of
9062,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the whole thing is that they meant nothing at all; they were only part
9063,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"of the Victorian absurdity. It is obvious that religious enthusiasm, as"
9064,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"a personal matter, means nothing to him. He investigates the feelings"
9065,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,of Newman or Keble as a naturalist might the contortions of an insect.
9066,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,The ceremonies and rites of the Church are objects of subdued hilarity
9067,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"to him, and in their presence, if he suppresses his laughter, it is"
9068,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,solely to prevent his missing any detail precious to his curiosity. When
9069,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the subject of Baptismal Regeneration agitates the whole pious world of
9070,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"England Mr. Strachey seems to say, looking down with exhilaration on the"
9071,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"anthill beneath him, ""The questions at issue are being taken very"
9072,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"seriously by a large number of persons. How Early Victorian of them!"""
9073,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Mr. Strachey has yet to learn that questions of this kind are ""taken"
9074,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"seriously"" by serious people, and that their emotion is both genuine and"
9075,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,deep. He sees nothing but alcoholic eccentricity in the mysticism of
9076,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Gordon. His cynicism sometimes carries him beyond the confines of good
9077,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"taste, as in the passage where he refers to the large and dirty ears of"
9078,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the Roman cardinals. Still worse is the query as to what became of the
9079,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,soul of Pope Pius IX. after his death.
9080,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9081,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,These are errors in discretion. A fault in art is the want of care which
9082,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the author takes in delineating his minor or subordinate figures. He
9083,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"gives remarkable pains, for example, to his study of General Gordon, but"
9084,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,he is indifferent to accuracy in his sketches of the persons who came
9085,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"into contact, and often into collision, with Gordon. In this he"
9086,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"resembles those French painters, such as Bastien Lepage, who focus their"
9087,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"eye on one portion of their canvas, and work that up to a high"
9088,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"perfection, while leaving the rest of the picture misty and vague. Even"
9089,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"in that case the subordinate figures, if subdued in fogginess, should"
9090,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"not be falsely drawn, but Mr. Strachey, intent upon the violent portrait"
9091,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"of Gordon, is willing to leave his Baring and Hartington and Wolseley"
9092,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"inexact as well as shadowy. The essay on General Gordon, indeed, is the"
9093,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"least successful of the four monographs. Dexterous as he is, Mr."
9094,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Strachey has not had the material to work upon which now exists to
9095,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,elucidate his other and earlier subjects. But it is difficult to account
9096,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,for his apparently not having read Mr. Bernard Holland's life of the
9097,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Duke of Devonshire, which throws much light, evidently unknown to Mr."
9098,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Strachey, on the Gordon relief expedition. He ought to know that Sir"
9099,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Evelyn Baring urged the expedition, while Chamberlain was one of its"
9100,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,opponents. Mr. Strachey does not seem to have noticed how much the issue
9101,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,was confused by conflicting opinions as to whether the route to be taken
9102,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,should be by Suakin or up the Nile.
9103,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9104,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,No part of his book is more vigorous or picturesque than the chapter
9105,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,dealing with the proclamation of Papal Infallibility. But here again one
9106,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,is annoyed by the glibness with which Mr. Strachey smoothly asserts what
9107,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,are only his conjectures.
9108,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9109,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,In his account of Manning's reception in Rome--and this is of central
9110,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,importance in his picture of Manning's whole career--he exaggerates the
9111,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"personal policy of Pio Nono, whom he represents as more independent of"
9112,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the staff of the Curia than was possible. Rome has never acknowledged
9113,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the right of the individual, even though that individual be the Pope, to"
9114,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,an independent authority. Mr. Odo Russell was resident secretary in Rome
9115,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"from 1858 to 1870, and his period of office was drawing to a close when"
9116,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Manning arrived; he was shortly afterwards removed to become Assistant
9117,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Under Secretary of State at our Foreign Office. The author of _Eminent
9118,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Victorians_ is pleased to describe ""poor Mr. Russell"" as little better"
9119,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"than a fly buzzing in Manning's ""spider's web of delicate and clinging"
9120,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"diplomacy."" It is not in the memory of those who were behind the scenes"
9121,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"that Odo Russell was such a cipher. Though suave in address, he was by"
9122,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"no means deficient in decision or force of character, as was evidenced"
9123,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"when, some months later, he explained to Mr. Gladstone his reasons for"
9124,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"stating to Bismarck, without instructions from the government, that the"
9125,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Black Sea question was one on which Great Britain might be compelled to
9126,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,go to war with or without allies. Lord Morley's _Life of Gladstone_
9127,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"(vol. ii., p. 354) is explicit on this interesting point. The"
9128,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"information which, by special permission of the Pope, Cardinal Manning"
9129,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"was able to give to him on all that was going on in the Council was, of"
9130,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"course, of great value to Odo Russell, but his views on other aspects of"
9131,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the question were derived from quite different sources.
9132,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9133,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"In this respect he had the advantage of the Cardinal, both on account of"
9134,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,his diplomatic position and of his long and intimate knowledge both of
9135,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Vatican policy and of the forces which the Curia has at its command. On
9136,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the strength of those forces, and on the small amount of effective"
9137,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,support which British opposition to the Decree of Infallibility was
9138,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"likely to receive from the Catholic Powers, he no doubt held strong"
9139,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,opinions. Some years later he did not conceal his conviction that Prince
9140,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Bismarck would be worsted in his conflict with Rome on the Education
9141,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Laws, and the event proved his forecast to be perfectly correct. This is"
9142,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,an example of the dangers which beset a too glib and superficial
9143,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"treatment of political events which were conducted in secret, and with"
9144,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,every circumstance of mystery.
9145,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9146,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Several of the characteristics which diversify Mr. Strachey's remarkable
9147,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,volume are exemplified in the following quotation. It deals with the
9148,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,funeral of Cardinal Manning:--
9149,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9150,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"""The route of the procession was lined by vast crowds of working"
9151,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"people, whose imaginations, in some instinctive manner, had been"
9152,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,touched. Many who had hardly seen him declared that in Cardinal
9153,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Manning they had lost their best friend. Was it the magnetic vigour
9154,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,of the dead man's spirit that moved them? Or was it his valiant
9155,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,disregard of common custom and those conventional reserves and
9156,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"poor punctilios, which are wont to hem about the great? Or was it"
9157,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"something untameable in his glances and in his gestures? Or was it,"
9158,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"perhaps, the mysterious glamour lingering about him of the antique"
9159,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"organisation of Rome? For whatever cause, the mind of the people"
9160,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"had been impressed; and yet, after all, the impression was more"
9161,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,acute than lasting. The Cardinal's memory is a dim thing to-day.
9162,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,And he who descends into the crypt of that Cathedral which Manning
9163,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"never lived to see, will observe, in the quiet niche with the"
9164,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"sepulchral monument, that the dust lies thick on the strange, the"
9165,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"incongruous, the almost impossible object which, with its"
9166,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"elaborations of dependent tassels, hangs down from the dim vault"
9167,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"like some forlorn and forgotten trophy, the Hat."""
9168,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9169,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Longinus tells us that ""a just judgment of style is the final fruit of"
9170,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"long experience."" In the measured utterances of Mr. Asquith we recognise"
9171,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the speech of a man to whom all that is old and good is familiar, and in"
9172,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,whom the art of finished expression has become a habit. No more
9173,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"elegantly balanced, no more delicately perceptive mind than his has"
9174,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"appeared of recent times in our midst, and there is something in the"
9175,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,equipoise of his own genius which points Mr. Asquith out as a judge
9176,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,peculiarly well fitted to sit in judgment upon rival ages. In his
9177,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Romanes lecture there was but one thing to be regretted: the restricted
9178,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,space which it offered for the full expansion of the theme. Mr. Asquith
9179,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"excels in swift and rapid flights, but even for him the Victorian Age is"
9180,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,too broad a province to be explored within one hour. He endeavoured to
9181,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"lighten his task by excluding theology and politics, and indeed but for"
9182,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,such self-denial he could scarcely have moved at all in so dense an air.
9183,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"He was able, however, having thrown out so much formidable ballast, to"
9184,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"rise above his subject, and gazing at the Victorian Age, as it recedes,"
9185,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,he declared it to have been very good. The young men who despise and
9186,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,attack that Age receive no support in any particular from Mr. Asquith.
9187,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9188,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,He dwells on the fecundity of the literature of the Victorian Age in its
9189,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"middle period, and especially on the publications which adorned the"
9190,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"decade from 1850 to 1859. He calls those years, very justly, ""marvellous"
9191,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"and almost unexampled"" in their rich profusion. I may suggest that the"
9192,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"only rival to them in our history is the period from 1590 to 1600, which"
9193,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"saw the early plays of Shakespeare, the _Faerie Queene_, the _Arcadia_,"
9194,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the _Ecclesiastical Polity_, _Tamburlaine_, _The Discovery of Guiana_,"
9195,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,and Bacon's _Essays_. If the works catalogued by Mr. Asquith do not
9196,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"equal these in intensity, they excel them by the breadth of the ground"
9197,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"they cover, extending from Browning to Darwin and from Thackeray to"
9198,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Ruskin. Moreover, the Oxford list might have included _Lavengro_ and"
9199,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Newman's _Lectures_, and Herbert Spencer's _Social Statics_. The only"
9200,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,third decade worthy to be named with those of 1590 and 1850 is that
9201,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"which opens in 1705, and is illuminated by the names of Pope,"
9202,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Shaftesbury, Swift, Arbuthnot, Defoe, Steele, Addison, and Berkeley. It"
9203,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"is pleasant to compare these three magnificently flowering epochs, but"
9204,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,not profitable if we attempt to weigh one against the other. They are
9205,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,comparable only in the splendour of their accomplishment.
9206,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9207,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,It is more difficult to fit science into our scheme of the Victorian Age
9208,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,than to find places there for Art and Literature. Perhaps the reason of
9209,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"this is that the latter were national in their character, whereas"
9210,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"scientific inquiry, throughout the nineteenth century, was carried on"
9211,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"upon international lines, or, at least, in a spirit unprecedentedly"
9212,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"non-provincial. The vast achievements of science, practical and"
9213,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"theoretical, were produced for the world, not for a race. Mr. Asquith"
9214,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,speaks with justice and eloquence of the appearance of Darwin's _Origin
9215,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"of Species_ which he distinguishes as being ""if not actually the most"
9216,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"important, certainly the most interesting event of the Age,"" and his"
9217,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,remarks on the fortune of that book are excellent. No one can
9218,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,over-estimate the value of what we owe to Darwin. But perhaps a
9219,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Frenchman might speak in almost the same terms of Claude Bernard, whose"
9220,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,life and work ran parallel with Darwin's. If the _Origin of Species_
9221,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"made an epoch in 1859, the _Introduction à la médicine expérimental_"
9222,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"made another in 1865. Both these books, as channels by which the"
9223,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,experimental labours of each investigator reached the prepared and
9224,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"instructed public, exercised at once, and have continued ever since to"
9225,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"exercise, an enormous effect on thought as well as on knowledge. They"
9226,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,transformed the methods by which man approaches scientific
9227,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"investigation, and while they instructed they stimulated a new ardour"
9228,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,for instruction. In each case the value of the discovery lay in the
9229,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"value of the idea which led to the discovery, and, as some one has said"
9230,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"in the case of Claude Bernard, they combined for the first time the"
9231,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,operations of science and philosophy. The parallel between these two
9232,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"contemporaries extends, in a measure, to their disciples and successors,"
9233,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,and seems to suggest that Mr. Asquith in his generous and difficult
9234,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,estimate may have exaggerated the purely Victorian element in the
9235,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"science of the age of Darwin. This only accentuates the difficulty, and"
9236,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,he may perhaps retort that there is an extreme danger in suggesting what
9237,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,does and what does not form a part of so huge a system.
9238,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9239,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Justifiably Mr. Asquith takes it for granted that the performance of the
9240,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,central years of the Victorian Age was splendid. With those who deny
9241,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,merit to the writers and artists of the last half century it is
9242,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,difficult to reach a common ground for argument. What is to be the
9243,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,criterion of taste if all the multiform exhibitions of it which passed
9244,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,muster from 1840 to 1890 are now to be swept away with contumely?
9245,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Perhaps indeed it is only among those extravagant romanticists who are
9246,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"trying to raise entirely new ideals, unrelated to any existing forms of"
9247,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"art and literature, that we find a denial of all merit to the Victorian"
9248,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"masters. Against this caricature of criticism, this Bolshevism, it would"
9249,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,be hopeless to contend. But there is a large and growing class of more
9250,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"moderate thinkers who hold, in the first place, that the merit of the"
9251,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"leading Victorian writers has been persistently over-estimated, and that"
9252,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"since its culmination the Victorian spirit has not ceased to decay,"
9253,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,arriving at length at the state of timidity and repetition which
9254,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"encourages what is ugly, narrow, and vulgar, and demands nothing better"
9255,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,than a swift dismissal to the dust-bin.
9256,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9257,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Every stratum of society, particularly if it is at all sophisticated,"
9258,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,contains a body of barbarians who are usually silent from lack of
9259,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"occasion to express themselves, but who are always ready to seize an"
9260,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,opportunity to suppress a movement of idealism. We accustom ourselves to
9261,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,the idea that certain broad principles of taste are universally
9262,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"accepted, and our respectable newspapers foster this benevolent delusion"
9263,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"by talking habitually ""over the heads,"" as we say, of the majority of"
9264,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"their readers. They make ""great music for a little clan,"" and nothing"
9265,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"can be more praiseworthy than their effort, but, as a matter of fact,"
9266,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"with or without the aid of the newspapers, the people who really care"
9267,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"for literature or art, or for strenuous mental exercise of any kind, are"
9268,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,relatively few. If we could procure a completely confidential statement
9269,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,of the number of persons to whom the names of Charles Lamb and
9270,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"Gainsborough have a distinct meaning, and still more of those who can"
9271,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,summon up an impression of the essays of the one and of the pictures of
9272,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"the other, we should in all probability be painfully startled. Yet since"
9273,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"these names enjoy what we call a universal celebrity, what must be the"
9274,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,popular relation to figures much less prominent?
9275,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9276,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"The result of this tyranny of fame, for so it must appear to all those"
9277,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"who are inconvenienced by the expression of it, is to rouse a sullen"
9278,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,tendency to attack the figures of art and literature whenever there
9279,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,arrives a chance of doing that successfully. Popular audiences can
9280,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"always be depended upon to cheer the statement of ""a plain man"" that he"
9281,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"is not ""clever"" enough to understand Browning or Meredith. An assurance"
9282,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,that life is too short to be troubled with Henry James wakes the lower
9283,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,middle class to ecstasy. An opportunity for such protests is provided by
9284,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"our English lack of critical tradition, by our accepted habit of saying,"
9285,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"""I do hate"" or ""I must say I rather like"" this or that without reference"
9286,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,to any species of authority. This seems to have grown with dangerous
9287,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"rapidity of late years. It was not tolerated among the Victorians, who"
9288,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"carried admiration to the highest pitch. They marshalled it, they"
9289,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"defined it, they turned it from a virtue into a religion, and called it"
9290,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Hero Worship. Even their abuse was a kind of admiration turned inside
9291,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"out, as in Swinburne's diatribes against Carlyle, who himself fought"
9292,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"against the theory of Darwin, not philosophically, but as though it were"
9293,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,a personal insult to himself. Such violence of taste is now gone out of
9294,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,fashion; every scribbler and dauber likes to believe himself on a level
9295,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"with the best, and the positive criterion of value which sincere"
9296,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,admiration gave is lost to us. Hence the success of Mr. Lytton Strachey.
9297,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,
9298,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"But the decline of ardour does not explain the whole position, which we"
9299,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"have to face with firmness. Epochs come to an end, and before they have"
9300,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,their place finally awarded to them in history they are bound to endure
9301,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,much vicissitude of fortune. No amount of sarcasm or of indignant
9302,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,protest will avail to conceal the fact that we stand to-day at the
9303,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"porch, that much more probably we have already penetrated far into the"
9304,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"vestibule, of a new age. What its character will be, or what its"
9305,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"principal products, it is absolutely impossible for us as yet to"
9306,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"conjecture. Meanwhile the Victorian Age recedes, and it loses size and"
9307,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,lustre as we get further and further away from it. When what was called
9308,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"""Symbolism"" began to act in urgent and direct reaction to the aims of"
9309,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"those still in authority, the old order received its notice to quit, but"
9310,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"that was at least five and twenty years ago, and the change is not"
9311,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,complete. Ages so multiform and redundant and full of blood as the
9312,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,Victorian take a long time to die; they have their surprising recoveries
9313,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,and their uncovenanted convalescences. But even they give up the ghost
9314,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,"at length, and are buried hastily with scant reverence. The time has"
9315,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,doubtless come when aged mourners must prepare themselves to attend the
9316,THE AGONY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE,obsequies of the Victorian Age with as much decency as they can muster.
