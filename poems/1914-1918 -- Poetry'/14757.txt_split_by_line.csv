337,BREAK OF DAY,"Of underground, or God's blank heart grown kind,"
338,BREAK OF DAY,That sent a happy dream to him in hell?--
339,BREAK OF DAY,"Where men are crushed like clods, and crawl to find"

1623,III,To the madrigal he sings.

1790,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,Adventurous lads will sigh and cast
1791,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,Proud looks upon the plundered past.
1792,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,"On summer morn or winter's night,"
1793,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,"Their hearts will kindle for the fight,"
1794,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,"Reading a snatch of soldier-song,"
1795,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,"Savage and jaunty, fierce and strong;"
1796,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,And through the angry marching rhymes
1797,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,"Of blind regret and haggard mirth,"

1803,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,"""War was a fiend who stopped our clocks"
1804,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,"Although we met him grim and gay."""
1805,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,"And then he'll speak of Haig's last drive,"
1806,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,Marvelling that any came alive
1807,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,Out of the shambles that men built
1808,SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR,"And smashed, to cleanse the world of guilt."

1815,EVERYONE SANG,EVERYONE SANG
1816,EVERYONE SANG,
1817,EVERYONE SANG,Everyone suddenly burst out singing;
1818,EVERYONE SANG,And I was filled with such delight
1819,EVERYONE SANG,As prisoned birds must find in freedom
1820,EVERYONE SANG,Winging wildly across the white
1821,EVERYONE SANG,Orchards and dark green fields; on; on; and out of sight.
1822,EVERYONE SANG,
1823,EVERYONE SANG,"Everyone's voice was suddenly lifted,"
1824,EVERYONE SANG,And beauty came like the setting sun.
1825,EVERYONE SANG,My heart was shaken with tears and horror
1826,EVERYONE SANG,Drifted away ... O but every one
1827,EVERYONE SANG,Was a bird; and the song was wordless; the singing will never be done.
1828,EVERYONE SANG,
