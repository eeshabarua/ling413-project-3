101,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Foreword
102,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
103,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
104,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
105,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,I've tinkered at my bits of rhymes
106,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"In weary, woeful, waiting times;"
107,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"In doleful hours of battle-din,"
108,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Ere yet they brought the wounded in;
109,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Through vigils of the fateful night,"
110,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,In lousy barns by candle-light;
111,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"In dug-outs, sagging and aflood,"
112,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,On stretchers stiff and bleared with blood;
113,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"By ragged grove, by ruined road,"
114,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,By hearths accurst where Love abode;
115,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"By broken altars, blackened shrines"
116,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,I've tinkered at my bits of rhymes.
117,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
118,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,I've solaced me with scraps of song
119,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The desolated ways along:
120,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Through sickly fields all shrapnel-sown,"
121,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And meadows reaped by death alone;
122,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"By blazing cross and splintered spire,"
123,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,By headless Virgin in the mire;
124,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"By gardens gashed amid their bloom,"
125,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"By gutted grave, by shattered tomb;"
126,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Beside the dying and the dead,"
127,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Where rocket green and rocket red,"
128,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"In trembling pools of poising light,"
129,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,With flowers of flame festoon the night.
130,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Ah me! by what dark ways of wrong
131,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,I've cheered my heart with scraps of song.
132,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
133,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"So here's my sheaf of war-won verse,"
134,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And some is bad, and some is worse."
135,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And if at times I curse a bit,"
136,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,You needn't read that part of it;
137,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,For through it all like horror runs
138,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The red resentment of the guns.
139,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And you yourself would mutter when
140,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"You took the things that once were men,"
141,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And sped them through that zone of hate
142,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,To where the dripping surgeons wait;
143,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And wonder too if in God's sight
144,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"War ever, ever can be right."
145,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
146,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Yet may it not be, crime and war"
147,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,But effort misdirected are?
148,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And if there's good in war and crime,"
149,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"There may be in my bits of rhyme,"
150,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,My songs from out the slaughter mill:
151,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,So take or leave them as you will.
152,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
153,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
154,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
155,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
156,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The Call
157,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
158,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"(France, August first, 1914)"
159,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
160,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
161,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
162,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Far and near, high and clear,"
163,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Hark to the call of War!
164,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Over the gorse and the golden dells,"
165,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Ringing and swinging of clamorous bells,"
166,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Praying and saying of wild farewells:
167,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,War!  War!  War!
168,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
169,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"High and low, all must go:"
170,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Hark to the shout of War!
171,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Leave to the women the harvest yield;
172,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Gird ye, men, for the sinister field;"
173,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,A sabre instead of a scythe to wield:
174,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,War!  Red War!
175,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
176,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Rich and poor, lord and boor,"
177,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Hark to the blast of War!
178,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Tinker and tailor and millionaire,"
179,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Actor in triumph and priest in prayer,"
180,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Comrades now in the hell out there,"
181,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Sweep to the fire of War!
182,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
183,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Prince and page, sot and sage,"
184,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Hark to the roar of War!
185,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Poet, professor and circus clown,"
186,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Chimney-sweeper and fop o' the town,"
187,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Into the pot and be melted down:
188,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Into the pot of War!
189,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
190,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Women all, hear the call,"
191,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The pitiless call of War!
192,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Look your last on your dearest ones,"
193,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Brothers and husbands, fathers, sons:"
194,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Swift they go to the ravenous guns,"
195,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The gluttonous guns of War.
196,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
197,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Everywhere thrill the air
198,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The maniac bells of War.
199,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,There will be little of sleeping to-night;
200,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,There will be wailing and weeping to-night;
201,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Death's red sickle is reaping to-night:
202,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,War!  War!  War!
203,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
204,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
205,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
206,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
207,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The Fool
208,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
209,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
210,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
211,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""But it isn't playing the game,"" he said,"
212,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And he slammed his books away;
213,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""The Latin and Greek I've got in my head"
214,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Will do for a duller day."""
215,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""Rubbish!"" I cried; ""The bugle's call"
216,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Isn't for lads from school."""
217,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"D'ye think he'd listen?  Oh, not at all:"
218,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"So I called him a fool, a fool."
219,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
220,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Now there's his dog by his empty bed,"
221,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And the flute he used to play,"
222,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And his favourite bat . . . but Dick he's dead,"
223,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Somewhere in France, they say:"
224,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Dick with his rapture of song and sun,"
225,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Dick of the yellow hair,"
226,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Dicky whose life had but begun,"
227,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Carrion-cold out there.
228,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
229,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Look at his prizes all in a row:
230,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Surely a hint of fame.
231,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Now he's finished with,--nothing to show:"
232,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Doesn't it seem a shame?
233,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Look from the window!  All you see
234,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Was to be his one day:
235,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Forest and furrow, lawn and lea,"
236,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And he goes and chucks it away.
237,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
238,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Chucks it away to die in the dark:
239,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Somebody saw him fall,"
240,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Part of him mud, part of him blood,"
241,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The rest of him--not at all.
242,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And yet I'll bet he was never afraid,"
243,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And he went as the best of 'em go,"
244,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"For his hand was clenched on his broken blade,"
245,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And his face was turned to the foe.
246,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
247,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And I called him a fool . . . oh how blind was I!
248,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And the cup of my grief's abrim.
249,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Will Glory o' England ever die
250,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,So long as we've lads like him?
251,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"So long as we've fond and fearless fools,"
252,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Who, spurning fortune and fame,"
253,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Turn out with the rallying cry of their schools,"
254,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Just bent on playing the game.
255,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
256,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,A fool!  Ah no!  He was more than wise.
257,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,His was the proudest part.
258,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"He died with the glory of faith in his eyes,"
259,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And the glory of love in his heart.
260,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And though there's never a grave to tell,"
261,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Nor a cross to mark his fall,"
262,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Thank God! we know that he ""batted well"""
263,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,In the last great Game of all.
264,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
265,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
266,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
267,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
268,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The Volunteer
269,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
270,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
271,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
272,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Sez I:  My Country calls?  Well, let it call."
273,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,I grins perlitely and declines wiv thanks.
274,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Go, let 'em plaster every blighted wall,"
275,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,'Ere's _ONE_ they don't stampede into the ranks.
276,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Them politicians with their greasy ways;
277,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Them empire-grabbers--fight for 'em?  No fear!
278,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,I've seen this mess a-comin' from the days
279,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Of Algyserious and Aggydear:
280,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"I've felt me passion rise and swell,"
281,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"But . . . wot the 'ell, Bill?  Wot the 'ell?"
282,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
283,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Sez I:  My Country?  Mine?  I likes their cheek.
284,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Me mud-bespattered by the cars they drive,"
285,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Wot makes my measly thirty bob a week,"
286,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And sweats red blood to keep meself alive!
287,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Fight for the right to slave that they may spend,"
288,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Them in their mansions, me 'ere in my slum?"
289,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"No, let 'em fight wot's something to defend:"
290,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"But me, I've nothin'--let the Kaiser come."
291,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And so I cusses 'ard and well,"
292,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"But . . . wot the 'ell, Bill?  Wot the 'ell?"
293,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
294,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Sez I:  If they would do the decent thing,"
295,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And shield the missis and the little 'uns,"
296,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Why, even _I_ might shout ""God save the King"","
297,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And face the chances of them 'ungry guns.
298,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"But we've got three, another on the way;"
299,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,It's that wot makes me snarl and set me jor:
300,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"The wife and nippers, wot of 'em, I say,"
301,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,If I gets knocked out in this blasted war?
302,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Gets proper busted by a shell,"
303,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"But . . . wot the 'ell, Bill?  Wot the 'ell?"
304,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
305,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Ay, wot the 'ell's the use of all this talk?"
306,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"To-day some boys in blue was passin' me,"
307,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And some of 'em they 'ad no legs to walk,"
308,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And some of 'em they 'ad no eyes to see.
309,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And--well, I couldn't look 'em in the face,"
310,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And so I'm goin', goin' to declare"
311,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,I'm under forty-one and take me place
312,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,To face the music with the bunch out there.
313,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"A fool, you say!  Maybe you're right."
314,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,I'll 'ave no peace unless I fight.
315,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,I've ceased to think; I only know
316,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"I've gotta go, Bill, gotta go."
317,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
318,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
319,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
320,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
321,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The Convalescent
322,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
323,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
324,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
325,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,. . . So I walked among the willows very quietly all night;
326,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"There was no moon at all, at all; no timid star alight;"
327,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"There was no light at all, at all; I wint from tree to tree,"
328,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And I called him as his mother called, but he nivver answered me."
329,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
330,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Oh I called him all the night-time, as I walked the wood alone;"
331,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And I listened and I listened, but I nivver heard a moan;"
332,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Then I found him at the dawnin', when the sorry sky was red:"
333,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"I was lookin' for the livin', but I only found the dead."
334,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
335,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Sure I know that it was Shamus by the silver cross he wore;
336,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"But the bugles they were callin', and I heard the cannon roar."
337,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Oh I had no time to tarry, so I said a little prayer,"
338,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And I clasped his hands together, and I left him lyin' there."
339,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
340,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Now the birds are singin', singin', and I'm home in Donegal,"
341,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And it's Springtime, and I'm thinkin' that I only dreamed it all;"
342,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"I dreamed about that evil wood, all crowded with its dead,"
343,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Where I knelt beside me brother when the battle-dawn was red.
344,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
345,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Where I prayed beside me brother ere I wint to fight anew:
346,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Such dreams as these are evil dreams; I can't believe it's true.
347,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Where all is love and laughter, sure it's hard to think of loss . . ."
348,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"But mother's sayin' nothin', and she clasps--_A SILVER CROSS_."
349,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
350,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
351,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
352,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
353,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The Man from Athabaska
354,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
355,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
356,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
357,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Oh the wife she tried to tell me that 'twas nothing but the thrumming
358,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Of a wood-pecker a-rapping on the hollow of a tree;
359,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And she thought that I was fooling when I said it was the drumming
360,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Of the mustering of legions, and 'twas calling unto me;"
361,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,'Twas calling me to pull my freight and hop across the sea.
362,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
363,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And a-mending of my fish-nets sure I started up in wonder,"
364,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,For I heard a savage roaring and 'twas coming from afar;
365,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Oh the wife she tried to tell me that 'twas only summer thunder,"
366,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And she laughed a bit sarcastic when I told her it was War;
367,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,'Twas the chariots of battle where the mighty armies are.
368,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
369,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Then down the lake came Half-breed Tom with russet sail a-flying,"
370,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And the word he said was ""War"" again, so what was I to do?"
371,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Oh the dogs they took to howling, and the missis took to crying,"
372,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,As I flung my silver foxes in the little birch canoe:
373,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Yes, the old girl stood a-blubbing till an island hid the view."
374,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
375,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Says the factor:  ""Mike, you're crazy!  They have soldier men a-plenty."
376,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"You're as grizzled as a badger, and you're sixty year or so."""
377,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""But I haven't missed a scrap,"" says I, ""since I was one and twenty."
378,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And shall I miss the biggest?  You can bet your whiskers--no!"""
379,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,So I sold my furs and started . . . and that's eighteen months ago.
380,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
381,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"For I joined the Foreign Legion, and they put me for a starter"
382,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,In the trenches of the Argonne with the Boche a step away;
383,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And the partner on my right hand was an 'apache' from Montmartre;
384,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"On my left there was a millionaire from Pittsburg, U. S. A."
385,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,(Poor fellow!  They collected him in bits the other day.)
386,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
387,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"But I'm sprier than a chipmunk, save a touch of the lumbago,"
388,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And they calls me Old Methoosalah, and 'blagues' me all the day."
389,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"I'm their exhibition sniper, and they work me like a Dago,"
390,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And laugh to see me plug a Boche a half a mile away.
391,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Oh I hold the highest record in the regiment, they say."
392,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
393,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And at night they gather round me, and I tell them of my roaming"
394,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"In the Country of the Crepuscule beside the Frozen Sea,"
395,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Where the musk-ox runs unchallenged, and the cariboo goes homing;"
396,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And they sit like little children, just as quiet as can be:"
397,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Men of every crime and colour, how they harken unto me!"
398,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
399,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And I tell them of the Furland, of the tumpline and the paddle,"
400,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Of secret rivers loitering, that no one will explore;"
401,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And I tell them of the ranges, of the pack-strap and the saddle,"
402,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And they fill their pipes in silence, and their eyes beseech for more;"
403,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,While above the star-shells fizzle and the high explosives roar.
404,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
405,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And I tell of lakes fish-haunted, where the big bull moose are calling,"
406,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And forests still as sepulchres with never trail or track;
407,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And valleys packed with purple gloom, and mountain peaks appalling,"
408,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And I tell them of my cabin on the shore at Fond du Lac;
409,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And I find myself a-thinking:  Sure I wish that I was back.
410,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
411,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"So I brag of bear and beaver while the batteries are roaring,"
412,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And the fellows on the firing steps are blazing at the foe;
413,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And I yarn of fur and feather when the 'marmites' are a-soaring,"
414,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And they listen to my stories, seven 'poilus' in a row,"
415,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Seven lean and lousy 'poilus' with their cigarettes aglow.
416,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
417,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And I tell them when it's over how I'll hike for Athabaska;
418,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And those seven greasy 'poilus' they are crazy to go too.
419,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And I'll give the wife the ""pickle-tub"" I promised, and I'll ask her"
420,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"The price of mink and marten, and the run of cariboo,"
421,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And I'll get my traps in order, and I'll start to work anew."
422,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
423,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"For I've had my fill of fighting, and I've seen a nation scattered,"
424,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And an army swung to slaughter, and a river red with gore,"
425,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And a city all a-smoulder, and . . . as if it really mattered,"
426,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"For the lake is yonder dreaming, and my cabin's on the shore;"
427,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And the dogs are leaping madly, and the wife is singing gladly,"
428,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And I'll rest in Athabaska, and I'll leave it nevermore."

436,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"_Tramp, tramp, the grim road, the road from Mons to Wipers"
437,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,(I've 'ammered out this ditty with me bruised and bleedin' feet);
438,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Tramp, tramp, the dim road--we didn't 'ave no pipers,"
439,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And bellies that was 'oller was the drums we 'ad to beat.
440,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Tramp, tramp, the bad road, the bits o' kiddies cryin' there,"
441,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"The fell birds a-flyin' there, the 'ouses all aflame;"
442,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Tramp, tramp, the sad road, the pals I left a-lyin' there,"
443,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Red there, and dead there. . . .  Oh blimy, it's a shame!_"
444,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
445,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"A-singin' ""'Oo's Yer Lady Friend?"" we started out from 'Arver,"
446,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,A-singin' till our froats was dry--we didn't care a 'ang;
447,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"The Frenchies 'ow they lined the way, and slung us their palaver,"
448,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And all we knowed to arnser was the one word ""vang"";"
449,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"They gave us booze and caporal, and cheered for us like crazy,"
450,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And all the pretty gels was out to kiss us as we passed;
451,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And 'ow they all went dotty when we 'owled the Marcelaisey!
452,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Oh, Gawd!  Them was the 'appy days, the days too good to last."
453,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
454,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"We started out for God Knows Where, we started out a-roarin';"
455,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"We 'ollered:  ""'Ere We Are Again"", and 'struth! but we was dry."
456,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"The dust was gummin' up our ears, and 'ow the sweat was pourin';"
457,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"The road was long, the sun was like a brazier in the sky."
458,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"We wondered where the 'Uns was--we wasn't long a-wonderin',"
459,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,For down a scruff of 'ill-side they rushes like a flood;
460,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Then oh! 'twas music 'eavenly, our batteries a-thunderin',"
461,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And arms and legs went soarin' in the fountain of their blood.
462,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
463,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"For on they came like bee-swarms, a-hochin' and a-singin';"
464,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"We pumped the bullets into 'em, we couldn't miss a shot."
465,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"But though we mowed 'em down like grass, like grass was they a-springin',"
466,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And all our 'ands was blistered, for our rifles was so 'ot."
467,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"We roared with battle-fury, and we lammed the stuffin' out of 'em,"
468,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And then we fixed our bay'nets and we spitted 'em like meat.
469,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,You should 'ave 'eard the beggars squeal;
470,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"you should 'ave seen the rout of 'em,"
471,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And 'ow we cussed and wondered when the word came:  Retreat!
472,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
473,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Retreat!  That was the 'ell of it.  It fair upset our 'abits,"
474,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,A-runnin' from them blighters over 'alf the roads of France;
475,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"A-scurryin' before 'em like a lot of blurry rabbits,"
476,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And knowin' we could smash 'em if we just 'ad 'alf a chance.
477,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Retreat!  That was the bitter bit, a-limpin' and a-blunderin';"
478,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,All day and night a-hoofin' it and sleepin' on our feet;
479,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"A-fightin' rear guard actions for a bit o' rest, and wonderin'"
480,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,If sugar beets or mangels was the 'olesomest to eat.
481,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
482,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Ho yus, there isn't many left that started out so cheerily;"
483,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,There was no bands a-playin' and we 'ad no autmobeels.
484,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Our tummies they was 'oller, and our 'eads was 'angin' wearily,"
485,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And if we stopped to light a fag the 'Uns was on our 'eels.
486,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"That rotten road!  I can't forget the kids and mothers flyin' there,"
487,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The bits of barns a-blazin' and the 'orrid sights I sor;
488,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"The stiffs that lined the wayside, me own pals a-lyin' there,"
489,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Their faces covered over wiv a little 'eap of stror.
490,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
491,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"_Tramp, tramp, the red road, the wicked bullets 'ummin'"
492,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,(I've panted out this ditty with me 'ot 'ard breath.)
493,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Tramp, tramp, the dread road, the Boches all a-comin',"
494,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The lootin' and the shootin' and the shrieks o' death.
495,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Tramp, tramp, the fell road, the mad 'orde pursuin' there,"
496,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And 'ow we 'urled it back again, them grim, grey waves;"
497,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Tramp, tramp, the 'ell road, the 'orror and the ruin there,"

508,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"It fair maks me hamesick,"" says Private McPhee."
509,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""And whit did she send ye?"" says Private McPhun,"
510,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,As he cockit his rifle and bleezed at a Hun.
511,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""A haggis!  A _HAGGIS!_"" says Private McPhee;"
512,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""The brawest big haggis I ever did see."
513,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And think! it's the morn when fond memory turns
514,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Tae haggis and whuskey--the Birthday o' Burns.
515,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,We maun find a dram; then we'll ca' in the rest
516,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"O' the lads, and we'll hae a Burns' Nicht wi' the best."""
517,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
518,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""Be ready at sundoon,"" snapped Sergeant McCole;"
519,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""I want you two men for the List'nin' Patrol."""
520,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Then Private McPhee looked at Private McPhun:
521,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""I'm thinkin', ma lad, we're confoundedly done."""
522,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Then Private McPhun looked at Private McPhee:
523,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""I'm thinkin' auld chap, it's a' aff wi' oor spree."""
524,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"But up spoke their crony, wee Wullie McNair:"

528,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Sae rin, lads, and think, though the nicht it be black,"
529,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"O' the haggis that's waitin' ye when ye get back."""
530,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
531,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"My! but it wis waesome on Naebuddy's Land,"
532,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And the deid they were rottin' on every hand.
533,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And the rockets like corpse candles hauntit the sky,"
534,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And the winds o' destruction went shudderin' by.
535,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"There wis skelpin' o' bullets and skirlin' o' shells,"
536,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And breengin' o' bombs and a thoosand death-knells;
537,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,But cooryin' doon in a Jack Johnson hole
538,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Little fashed the twa men o' the List'nin' Patrol.
539,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,For sweeter than honey and bricht as a gem
540,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Wis the thocht o' the haggis that waitit for them.
541,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
542,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Yet alas! in oor moments o' sunniest cheer
543,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Calamity's aften maist cruelly near.
544,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And while the twa talked o' their puddin' divine
545,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The Boches below them were howkin' a mine.
546,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And while the twa cracked o' the feast they would hae,"
547,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The fuse it wis burnin' and burnin' away.
548,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Then sudden a roar like the thunner o' doom,"
549,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,A hell-leap o' flame . . . then the wheesht o' the tomb.
550,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
551,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""Haw, Jock!  Are ye hurtit?"" says Private McPhun."
552,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""Ay, Geordie, they've got me; I'm fearin' I'm done."
553,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,It's ma leg; I'm jist thinkin' it's aff at the knee;

558,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"I'm blindit, and that's whit's the maitter wi' me."""
559,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Then Private McPhee sadly shakit his heid:
560,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""If we bide here for lang, we'll be bidin' for deid."
561,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And yet, Geordie lad, I could gang weel content"

566,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"It's missin' that braw muckle haggis ye've got."""
567,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,For a while they were silent; then up once again

581,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"A staur-shell!  For Godsake!  Doun, lad, on yer daup."
582,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Bear aff tae yer richt. . . .  Aw yer jist daein' fine:
583,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Before the nicht's feenished on haggis we'll dine."""
584,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
585,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,There wis death and destruction on every hand;
586,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,There wis havoc and horror on Naebuddy's Land.
587,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And the shells bickered doun wi' a crump and a glare,"
588,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And the hameless wee bullets were dingin' the air.
589,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Yet on they went staggerin', cooryin' doun"
590,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,When the stutter and cluck o' a Maxim crept roun'.
591,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And the legs o' McPhun they were sturdy and stoot,"
592,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And McPhee on his back kept a bonnie look-oot.
593,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""On, on, ma brave lad!  We're no faur frae the goal;"

596,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"But strength has its leemit, and Private McPhun,"
597,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Wi' a sab and a curse fell his length on the grun'.
598,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Then Private McPhee shoutit doon in his ear:
599,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""Jist think o' the haggis!  I smell it from here."
600,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"It's gushin' wi' juice, it's embaumin' the air;"
601,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"It's steamin' for us, and we're--jist--aboot--there."""
602,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Then Private McPhun answers:  ""Dommit, auld chap!"
603,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"For the sake o' that haggis I'll gang till I drap."""
604,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And he gets on his feet wi' a heave and a strain,"
605,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And onward he staggers in passion and pain.
606,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And the flare and the glare and the fury increase,"
607,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,Till you'd think they'd jist taken a' hell on a lease.
608,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And on they go reelin' in peetifu' plight,"
609,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And someone is shoutin' away on their right;
610,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And someone is runnin', and noo they can hear"
611,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,A sound like a prayer and a sound like a cheer;
612,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And swift through the crash and the flash and the din,"
613,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,The lads o' the Hielands are bringin' them in.
614,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
615,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"""They're baith sairly woundit, but is it no droll"
616,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Hoo they rave aboot haggis?"" says Sergeant McCole."
617,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"When hirplin alang comes wee Wullie McNair,"
618,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And they a' wonnert why he wis greetin' sae sair.
619,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And he says:  ""I'd jist liftit it oot o' the pot,"
620,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And there it lay steamin' and savoury hot,"
621,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"When sudden I dooked at the fleech o' a shell,"
622,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And it--_DRAPPED ON THE HAGGIS AND DINGED IT TAE HELL._"""
623,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,
624,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And oh but the lads were fair taken aback;
625,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"Then sudden the order wis passed tae attack,"
626,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And up from the trenches like lions they leapt,"
627,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And on through the nicht like a torrent they swept.
628,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"On, on, wi' their bayonets thirstin' before!"
629,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"On, on tae the foe wi' a rush and a roar!"
630,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,"And wild to the welkin their battle-cry rang,"
631,| LIEUTENANT ALBERT SERVICE |,And doon on the Boches like tigers they sprang:

1027,COLD.,But I wouldn't just swear to that.
1028,COLD.,"And maybe she wasn't so bright,"
1029,COLD.,"Though she talked in a merry strain,"
1030,COLD.,"And I closed my eyes ever so tight,"
1031,COLD.,Yet I saw her ever so plain:
1032,COLD.,"Her dear little tilted nose,"
1033,COLD.,"Her delicate, dimpled chin,"
1034,COLD.,"Her mouth like a budding rose,"
1035,COLD.,And the glistening pearls within;
1036,COLD.,Her eyes like the violet:
1037,COLD.,Such a rare little queen--Fleurette.
1038,COLD.,
1039,COLD.,"And at last when she rose to go,"
1040,COLD.,"The light was a little dim,"
1041,COLD.,"And I ventured to peep, and so"
1042,COLD.,"I saw her, graceful and slim,"
1043,COLD.,"And she kissed him and kissed him, and oh"
1044,COLD.,How I envied and envied him!
1045,COLD.,
1046,COLD.,So when she was gone I said
1047,COLD.,In rather a dreary voice
1048,COLD.,To him of the opposite bed:
1049,COLD.,"""Ah, friend, how you must rejoice!"
1050,COLD.,"But me, I'm a thing of dread."
1051,COLD.,"For me nevermore the bliss,"
1052,COLD.,"The thrill of a woman's kiss."""
1053,COLD.,
1054,COLD.,"Then I stopped, for lo! she was there,"
1055,COLD.,And a great light shone in her eyes.
1056,COLD.,"And me!  I could only stare,"
1057,COLD.,"I was taken so by surprise,"
1058,COLD.,When gently she bent her head:
1059,COLD.,"""May I kiss you, Sergeant?"" she said."
1060,COLD.,
1061,COLD.,Then she kissed my burning lips
1062,COLD.,"With her mouth like a scented flower,"
1063,COLD.,"And I thrilled to the finger-tips,"
1064,COLD.,And I hadn't even the power
1065,COLD.,"To say:  ""God bless you, dear!"""
1066,COLD.,And I felt such a precious tear
1067,COLD.,"Fall on my withered cheek,"
1068,COLD.,And darn it!  I couldn't speak.
1069,COLD.,
1070,COLD.,"And so she went sadly away,"
1071,COLD.,And I knew that my eyes were wet.
1072,COLD.,"Ah, not to my dying day"
1073,COLD.,"Will I forget, forget!"
1074,COLD.,Can you wonder now I am gay?
1075,COLD.,"God bless her, that little Fleurette!"

1087,COLD.,"When your skin creeps like a pullet's,"

1110,COLD.,"So stand up, son; look gritty,"

1113,COLD.,"Just 'old yer rifle steady,"
1114,COLD.,"And 'ave yer bay'nit ready,"
1115,COLD.,For that's the way good soldier-men is made.
1116,COLD.,"And if you 'as to die,"
1117,COLD.,"As it sometimes 'appens, why,"
1118,COLD.,Far better die a 'ero than a skunk;
1119,COLD.,"A-doin' of yer bit,"

1138,COLD.,
1139,COLD.,"""I would have you raise me; I can see the West then:"
1140,COLD.,"I would see the sun set once before I go."""
1141,COLD.,"So he lay a-gazing, seemed to be at rest then,"

1143,COLD.,"So he lay a-watching rosy castles crumbling,"
1144,COLD.,"Moats of blinding amber, bastions of flame,"
1145,COLD.,"Rugged rifts of opal, crimson turrets tumbling;"

1148,COLD.,"""Open wide the window; there's a lark a-singing;"

1151,COLD.,Oh it's good to hear that when one has to die.
1152,COLD.,I am horror-haunted from the hell they found me;

1159,COLD.,"So we brought our dearest, Doris all-enchanting;"

2146,"_CARRY ON, MY SOUL!  CARRY ON!_","For his going opens a tragic door that gives on a world of pain,"

2148,"_CARRY ON, MY SOUL!  CARRY ON!_",

2430,_MON DIEU!  QUELLE VACHE DE GUERRE._,
2431,_MON DIEU!  QUELLE VACHE DE GUERRE._,"So I lifted my arm, the right,"

2445,_MON DIEU!  QUELLE VACHE DE GUERRE._,

2582,_I'D CLEAN FORGOTTEN ME OLD CLAY PIPE._,"I run bang into a German chap,"

3472,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","As I was saying, our Colonel leaped up like a youngster of ten:"
3473,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","""Come on, lads!"" he shouts, ""and we'll show 'em."""
3474,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",And he sprang to the head of the men.
3475,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Then some bally thing seemed to trip him,"
3476,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",and he fell on his face with a slam. . . .
3477,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Oh, he died like a true British soldier,"

3480,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",And I cared no more for the bullets than I would for a shower of rain.
3481,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","'Twas an awf'ly funny sensation (I say, this is jolly nice tea);"
3482,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",I felt as if something had broken; by gad! I was suddenly free.
3483,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Free for a glorified moment, beyond regulations and laws,"
3484,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Free just to wallow in slaughter, as the chap of the Stone Age was."
3485,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","So on I went joyously nursing a Berserker rage of my own,"
3486,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And though all my chaps were behind me, feeling most frightf'ly alone;"
3487,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","With the bullets and shells ding-donging,"
3488,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","and the ""krock"" and the swish of the shrap;"
3489,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And I found myself humming ""Ben Bolt"" . . ."
3490,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","(Will you pass me the sugar, old chap?"
3491,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Two lumps, please). . . .  What was I saying?  Oh yes, the jolly old dash;"
3492,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","We simply ripped through the barrage, and on with a roar and a crash."
3493,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","My fellows--Old Nick couldn't stop 'em.  On, on they went with a yell,"
3494,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Till they tripped on the Boches' sand-bags,--nothing much left to tell:"
3495,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",A trench so tattered and battered that even a rat couldn't live;
3496,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Some corpses tangled and mangled, wire you could pass through a sieve."
3497,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","The jolly old guns had bilked us, cheated us out of our show,"
3498,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",And my fellows were simply yearning for a red mix-up with the foe.
3499,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","So I shouted to them to follow, and on we went roaring again,"
3500,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Battle-tuned and exultant, on in the leaden rain."
3501,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Then all at once a machine gun barks from a bit of a bank,"
3502,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And our Major roars in a fury:  ""We've got to take it on flank."""
3503,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","He was running like fire to lead us, when down like a stone he comes,"
3504,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","As full of ""typewriter"" bullets as a pudding is full of plums."
3505,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",So I took his job and we got 'em. . . .  By gad! we got 'em like rats;
3506,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",Down in a deep shell-crater we fought like Kilkenny cats.
3507,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","'Twas pleasant just for a moment to be sheltered and out of range,"
3508,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",With someone you _SAW_ to go for--it made an agreeable change.
3509,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And the Boches that missed my bullets, my chaps gave a bayonet jolt,"
3510,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And all the time, I remember, I whistled and hummed ""Ben Bolt""."
3511,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",
3512,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Well, that little job was over, so hell for leather we ran,"
3513,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","On to the second line trenches,--that's where the fun began."
3514,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","For though we had strafed 'em like fury, there still were some Boches about,"
3515,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And my fellows, teeth set and eyes glaring, like terriers routed 'em out."
3516,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Then I stumbled on one of their dug-outs, and I shouted:  ""Is anyone there?"""
3517,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And a voice, ""Yes, one; but I'm wounded,"" came faint up the narrow stair;"
3518,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And my man was descending before me, when sudden a cry! a shot!"
3519,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","(I say, this cake is delicious.  You make it yourself, do you not?)"
3520,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","My man?  Oh, they killed the poor devil; for if there was one there was ten;"
3521,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","So after I'd bombed 'em sufficient I went down at the head of my men,"
3522,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And four tried to sneak from a bunk-hole,"
3523,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",but we cornered the rotters all right;
3524,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","I'd rather not go into details, 'twas messy that bit of the fight."
3525,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",But all of it's beastly messy; let's talk of pleasanter things:
3526,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","The skirts that the girls are wearing, ridiculous fluffy things,"
3527,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","So short that they show. . . .  Oh, hang it!  Well, if I must, I must."
3528,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","We cleaned out the second trench line, bomb and bayonet thrust;"
3529,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And on we went to the third one, quite calloused to crumping by now;"
3530,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",And some of our fellows who'd passed us were making a deuce of a row;
3531,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And my chaps--well, I just couldn't hold 'em;"
3532,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",(It's strange how it is with gore;
3533,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",In some ways it's just like whiskey:  if you taste it you must have more.)
3534,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Their eyes were like beacons of battle; by gad, sir! they _COULDN'T_ be calmed,"
3535,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","So I headed 'em bang for the bomb-belt, racing like billy-be-damned."
3536,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Oh, it didn't take long to arrive there, those who arrived at all;"
3537,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","The machine guns were certainly chronic, the shindy enough to appal."
3538,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Oh yes, I omitted to tell you, I'd wounds on the chest and the head,"
3539,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And my shirt was torn to a gun-rag, and my face blood-gummy and red."
3540,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","I'm thinking I looked like a madman; I fancy I felt one too,"
3541,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","Half naked and swinging a rifle. . . .  God! what a glorious ""do""."
3542,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","As I sit here in old Piccadilly, sipping my afternoon tea,"
3543,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","I see a blind, bullet-chipped devil, and it's hard to believe that it's me;"
3544,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","I see a wild, war-damaged demon, smashing out left and right,"
3545,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And humming ""Ben Bolt"" rather loudly, and hugely enjoying the fight."
3546,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And as for my men, may God bless 'em!  I've loved 'em ever since then:"
3547,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","They fought like the shining angels; they're the pick o' the land, my men."
3548,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And the trench was a reeking shambles, not a Boche to be seen alive--"
3549,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",So I thought; but on rounding a traverse I came on a covey of five;
3550,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And four of 'em threw up their flippers,"
3551,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","but the fifth chap, a sergeant, was game,"
3552,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",And though I'd a bomb and revolver he came at me just the same.
3553,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","A sporty thing that, I tell you; I just couldn't blow him to hell,"
3554,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","So I swung to the point of his jaw-bone, and down like a ninepin he fell."
3555,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And then when I'd brought him to reason, he wasn't half bad, that Hun;"
3556,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_",He bandaged my head and my short-rib as well as the Doc could have done.
3557,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","So back I went with my Boches, as gay as a two-year-old colt,"
3558,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And it suddenly struck me as rummy, I still was a-humming ""Ben Bolt""."
3559,"_O PRINCE OF PEACE!  'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?_","And now, by Jove! how I've bored you.  You've just let me babble away;"
