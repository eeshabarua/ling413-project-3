40,,IS is the story of
41,,
42,,````Ensign Joy
43,,
44,,````And the obsolete
45,,
46,,`````rank withal
47,,
48,,````That I love for each gentle English
49,,
50,,`````boy
51,,
52,,````Who jumped to his country's
53,,
54,,`````call.
55,,
56,,"````By their fire and fun, and the"
57,,
58,,"`````deeds they've done,"
59,,
60,,````I would gazette them Second to
61,,
62,,`````none
63,,
64,,````Who faces a gun in Gaul!)
65,,
66,,
67,,
68,,|IT is also the story of Ermyntrude
69,,
70,,````A less appropriate name
71,,
72,,````For the dearest prig and the
73,,
74,,`````prettiest prude!
75,,
76,,"````But under it, all the same,"
77,,
78,,````The usual consanguineous squad
79,,
80,,````Had made her an honest child
81,,
82,,`````of God--
83,,
84,,````And left her to play the game.
85,,
86,,
87,,
88,,|IT was just when the grind of
89,,
90,,"`````the Special Reserves,"
91,,
92,,"````Employed upon Coast Defence,"
93,,
94,,````Was getting on every Ensign's
95,,
96,,`````nerves--
97,,
98,,````Sick-keen to be drafted
99,,
100,,`````hence--
101,,
102,,````That they met and played tennis
103,,
104,,"`````and danced and sang,"
105,,
106,,````The lad with the laugh and the
107,,
108,,"`````schoolboy slang,"
109,,
110,,````The girl with the eyes intense.
111,,
112,,
113,,
114,,|YET it wasn't for him that she
115,,
116,,"`````languished and sighed,"
117,,
118,,````But for all of our dear deemed
119,,
120,,`````youth;
121,,
122,,"````And it wasn't for her, but her"
123,,
124,,"`````sex, that he cried,"
125,,
126,,````If he could but have probed
127,,
128,,`````the truth !
129,,
130,,````Did she? She would none of his
131,,
132,,`````hot young heart;
133,,
134,,````As khaki escort he's tall and
135,,
136,,"`````smart,"
137,,
138,,````As lover a shade uncouth.
139,,
140,,
141,,
142,,|HE went with his draft. She
143,,
144,,`````returned to her craft.
145,,
146,,````He wrote in his merry vein:
147,,
148,,"````She read him aloud, and the"
149,,
150,,````Studio laughed!
151,,
152,,````Ermyntrude bore the strain.
153,,
154,,````He was full of gay bloodshed and
155,,
156,,````Old Man Fritz:
157,,
158,,````His flippancy sent her friends
159,,
160,,`````into fits.
161,,
162,,````Ermyntrude frowned with
163,,
164,,`````pain.
165,,
166,,
167,,
168,,|HIS tales of the Sergeant who
169,,
170,,`````swore so hard
171,,
172,,````Left Ermyntrude cold and
173,,
174,,`````prim;
175,,
176,,````The tactless truth of the picture
177,,
178,,"`````jarred,"
179,,
180,,````And some of his jokes were
181,,
182,,`````grim.
183,,
184,,"````Yet, let him but skate upon"
185,,
186,,"`````tender ice,"
187,,
188,,````And he had to write to her twice
189,,
190,,`````or thrice
191,,
192,,````Before she would answer him.
193,,
194,,
195,,
196,,|YET once she sent him a
197,,
198,,"`````fairy's box,"
199,,
200,,````And her pocket felt the brunt
201,,
202,,````Of tinned contraptions and
203,,
204,,`````books and socks--
205,,
206,,"````Which he hailed as ""a sporting"
207,,
208,,"`````stunt!"""
209,,
210,,````She slaved at his muffler none
211,,
212,,"`````the less,"
213,,
214,,````And still took pleasure in mur-
215,,
216,,"`````muring, ""Yes!"
217,,
218,,````For a friend of mine at the
219,,
220,,"````Front."")"
221,,
222,,
223,,
224,,|ONE fine morning his name
225,,
226,,`````appears--
227,,
228,,````Looking so pretty in print!
229,,
230,,"````""Wounded!"" she warbles in"
231,,
232,,`````tragedy tears--
233,,
234,,````And pictures the reddening
235,,
236,,"`````lint,"
237,,
238,,````The drawn damp face and the
239,,
240,,`````draggled hair . . .
241,,
242,,````But she found him blooming in
243,,
244,,"````Grosvenor Square,"
245,,
246,,````With a punctured shin in a
247,,
248,,`````splint.
249,,
250,,
251,,
252,,|IT wasn't a haunt of Ermyn-
253,,
254,,"`````trude's,"
255,,
256,,````That grandiose urban pile;
257,,
258,,````Like starlight in arctic altitudes
259,,
260,,````Was the stately Sister's smile.
261,,
262,,````It was just the reverse with
263,,
264,,````Ensign Joy--
265,,
266,,````In his golden greeting no least
267,,
268,,`````alloy--
269,,
270,,````In his shining eyes no guile!
271,,
272,,
273,,
274,,|HE showed her the bullet that
275,,
276,,`````did the trick--
277,,
278,,"````He showed her the trick,"
279,,
280,,`````x-ray'd;
281,,
282,,````He showed her a table timed to
283,,
284,,"`````a tick,"
285,,
286,,````And a map that an airman
287,,
288,,`````made.
289,,
290,,````He spoke of a shell that caused grievous loss--
291,,
292,,````But he never mentioned a certain
293,,
294,,`````cross
295,,
296,,````For his part in the escapade!
297,,
298,,
299,,
300,,|SHE saw it herself in a list next
301,,
302,,"`````day,"
303,,
304,,````And it brought her back to his
305,,
306,,"`````bed,"
307,,
308,,````With a number of beautiful
309,,
310,,"`````things to say,"
311,,
312,,````Which were mostly over his
313,,
314,,`````head.
315,,
316,,````Turned pink as his own pyjamas'
317,,
318,,"`````stripe,"
319,,
320,,````To her mind he ceased to em-
321,,
322,,`````body a type--
323,,
324,,````Sank into her heart instead.
325,,
326,,
327,,
328,,|I WONDER that all of you
329,,
330,,"`````didn't retire!"""
331,,
332,,"````""My blighters were not that"
333,,
334,,"`````kind."""
335,,
336,,"````""But it says _you_ 'advanced un-"
337,,
338,,"`````der murderous fire,"
339,,
340,,````Machine-gun and shell com-
341,,
342,,"`````bined--'"""
343,,
344,,"````""Oh, that's the regular War"
345,,
346,,"````Office wheeze!"""
347,,
348,,"````""'Advanced'--with that leg!--"
349,,
350,,"`````'on his hands and knees'!"""
351,,
352,,"````""I couldn't leave it behind."""
353,,
354,,
355,,
356,,|HE was soon trick-driving an
357,,
358,,"`````invalid chair,"
359,,
360,,`````and dancing about on a crutch;
361,,
362,,````The _haute noblesse_ of Grosvenor
363,,
364,,````Square
365,,
366,,````Felt bound to oblige as such;
367,,
368,,````They sent him for many a motor-
369,,
370,,`````whirl--
371,,
372,,"````With the wistful, willowy wisp of"
373,,
374,,`````a girl
375,,
376,,````Who never again lost touch.
377,,
378,,
379,,
380,,|THEIR people were most of
381,,
382,,`````them dead and gone.
383,,
384,,````They had only themselves to
385,,
386,,````His pay was enough to marry
387,,
388,,"`````upon,"
389,,
390,,````As every Ensign sees.
391,,
392,,````They would muddle along (as
393,,
394,,`````in fact they did)
395,,
396,,````With vast supplies of the _tertium
397,,
398,,`````quid_
399,,
400,,````You bracket with bread-and-
401,,
402,,`````cheese.
403,,
404,,`````please.
405,,
406,,
407,,
408,,|THEY gave him some leave
409,,
410,,`````after Grosvenor Square--
411,,
412,,````And bang went a month on
413,,
414,,`````banns;
415,,
416,,````For Ermyntrude had a natural
417,,
418,,`````_flair_
419,,
420,,````For the least unusual plans.
421,,
422,,````Her heaviest uncle came down
423,,
424,,"`````well,"
425,,
426,,"````And entertained, at a fair hotel,"
427,,
428,,````The dregs of the coupled clans.
429,,
430,,
431,,
432,,|A CERTAIN number of
433,,
434,,`````cheques accrued
435,,
436,,````To keep the wolf from the
437,,
438,,`````door:
439,,
440,,````The economical Ermyntrude
441,,
442,,````Had charge of the dwindling
443,,
444,,"`````store,"
445,,
446,,````When a Board reported her
447,,
448,,`````bridegroom fit
449,,
450,,````As--some expression she didn't
451,,
452,,`````permit . . .
453,,
454,,````And he left for the Front once
455,,
456,,`````more.
457,,
458,,
459,,
460,,|HIS crowd had been climbing
461,,
462,,`````the jaws of hell:
463,,
464,,````He found them in death's dog-
465,,
466,,"`````teeth,"
467,,
468,,````With little to show but a good
469,,
470,,`````deal to tell
471,,
472,,````In their fissure of smoking
473,,
474,,`````heath.
475,,
476,,````There were changes--of course
477,,
478,,`````--but the change in him
479,,
480,,````Was the ribbon that showed on
481,,
482,,`````his tunic trim
483,,
484,,````And the tumult hidden be-
485,,
486,,`````neath!
487,,
488,,
489,,
490,,|FOR all he had suffered and
491,,
492,,`````seen before
493,,
494,,````Seemed nought to a husband's
495,,
496,,`````care;
497,,
498,,````And the Chinese puzzle of mod-
499,,
500,,`````ern war
501,,
502,,````For subtlety couldn't compare
503,,
504,,````With the delicate springs of the
505,,
506,,`````complex life
507,,
508,,````To be led with a highly sensitised
509,,
510,,`````wife
511,,
512,,````In a slightly rarefied air!
513,,
514,,
515,,
516,,|YET it's good to be back with
517,,
518,,`````the old platoon--
519,,
520,,"````""A man in a world of men""!"
521,,
522,,````Each cheery dog is a henchman
523,,
524,,`````boon--
525,,
526,,````Especially Sergeant Wren!
527,,
528,,````Ermyntrude couldn't endure his
529,,
530,,`````name--
531,,
532,,````Considered bad language no lien
533,,
534,,"`````on fame,"
535,,
536,,````Yet it's good to--hear it
537,,
538,,`````again!
539,,
540,,
541,,
542,,|BETTER to feel the Ser-
543,,
544,,"`````geant's grip,"
545,,
546,,````Though your fingers ache to
547,,
548,,`````the bone!
549,,
550,,````Better to take the Sergeant's tip
551,,
552,,````Than to make up your mind
553,,
554,,`````alone.
555,,
556,,"````They can do things together, can"
557,,
558,,````Wren and Joy--
559,,
560,,````The bristly bear and the beard-
561,,
562,,`````less boy--
563,,
564,,````That neither could do on his
565,,
566,,`````own.
567,,
568,,
569,,
570,,|BUT there's never a word
571,,
572,,`````about Old Man Wren
573,,
574,,````In the screeds he scribbles
575,,
576,,`````to-day--
577,,
578,,````Though he praises his N.C.O.'s
579,,
580,,`````and men
581,,
582,,````In rather a pointed way.
583,,
584,,````And he rubs it in (with a knitted
585,,
586,,`````brow)
587,,
588,,````That the war's as good as a pic-
589,,
590,,"`````nic now,"
591,,
592,,````And better than any play!
593,,
594,,
595,,
596,,"|HIS booby-hutch is ""as safe"
597,,
598,,"`````as the Throne,"""
599,,
600,,"````And he fares ""like the C.-in-"

602,,"````Chief,"""
603,,
604,,"````But has purchased ""a top-hole"
605,,
606,,`````gramophone
607,,
608,,"````By way of comic relief."""
609,,
610,,````(And he sighs as he hears the
611,,
612,,"`````men applaud,"
613,,
614,,````While the Woodbine spices are
615,,
616,,`````wafted abroad
617,,
618,,````With the odour of bully-beef.)
619,,
620,,
621,,
622,,|HE may touch on the latest
623,,
624,,"`````type of bomb,"
625,,
626,,````But Ermyntrude needn't
627,,
628,,"`````blench,"
629,,
630,,````For he never says where you hurl
631,,
632,,"`````it from,"
633,,
634,,````And it might be from your
635,,
636,,`````trench.
637,,
638,,````He never might lead a stealthy
639,,
640,,"`````band,"
641,,
642,,````Or toe the horrors of No Man's
643,,
644,,"````Land,"
645,,
646,,````Or swim at the sickly stench. . . .
647,,
648,,
649,,
650,,|HER letters came up by
651,,
652,,`````ration-cart
653,,
654,,````As the men stood-to before
655,,
656,,`````dawn:
657,,
658,,````He followed the chart of her
659,,
660,,`````soaring heart
661,,
662,,````With face transfigured yet
663,,
664,,`````drawn:
665,,
666,,"````It filled him with pride, touched"
667,,
668,,`````with chivalrous shame.
669,,
670,,"````But--it spoilt the war, as a first-"
671,,
672,,"`````class game,"
673,,
674,,````For this particular pawn.
675,,
676,,
677,,
678,,"|THE Sergeant sees it, and"
679,,
680,,`````damns the cause
681,,
682,,````In a truly terrible flow;

686,,"`````a pause,"
687,,
688,,````A junior N. C. O.
