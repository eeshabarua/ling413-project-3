59,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,We are the Dead.  Short days ago

213,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"(These fought their fight in time of bitter fear,"
214,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,And died not knowing how the day had gone.)
215,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
216,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"O flashing muzzles, pause, and let them see"
217,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,The coming dawn that streaks the sky afar;
218,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Then let your mighty chorus witness be
219,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"To them, and Caesar, that we still make war."
220,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
221,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Tell them, O guns, that we have heard their call,"
222,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"That we have sworn, and will not turn aside,"
223,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"That we will onward till we win or fall,"
224,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,That we will keep the faith for which they died.
225,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
226,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Bid them be patient, and some day, anon,"
227,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,They shall feel earth enwrapt in silence deep;
228,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Shall greet, in wonderment, the quiet dawn,"
229,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,And in content may turn them to their sleep.

235,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
236,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
237,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
238,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"He wrought in poverty, the dull grey days,"
239,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,But with the night his little lamp-lit room
240,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Was bright with battle flame, or through a haze"
241,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Of smoke that stung his eyes he heard the boom
242,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Of Bluecher's guns; he shared Almeida's scars,"
243,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"And from the close-packed deck, about to die,"
244,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Looked up and saw the ""Birkenhead""'s tall spars"
245,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Weave wavering lines across the Southern sky:
246,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
247,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Or in the stifling 'tween decks, row on row,"
248,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"At Aboukir, saw how the dead men lay;"
249,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Charged with the fiercest in Busaco's strife,"
250,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Brave dreams are his -- the flick'ring lamp burns low --
251,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Yet couraged for the battles of the day
252,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,He goes to stand full face to face with life.

259,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
260,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
261,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"_Scarlet coats, and crash o' the band,"
262,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"The grey of a pauper's gown,"
263,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"A soldier's grave in Zululand,"
264,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,And a woman in Brecon Town._
265,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
266,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"My little lad for a soldier boy,"
267,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,(Mothers o' Brecon Town!)
268,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,My eyes for tears and his for joy
269,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"When he went from Brecon Town,"
270,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,His for the flags and the gallant sights
271,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"His for the medals and his for the fights,"
272,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"And mine for the dreary, rainy nights"
273,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,At home in Brecon Town.
274,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
275,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"They say he's laid beneath a tree,"
276,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,(Come back to Brecon Town!)
277,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Shouldn't I know? --  I was there to see:
278,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,(It's far to Brecon Town!)
279,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,It's me that keeps it trim and drest
280,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,With a briar there and a rose by his breast --
281,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,The English flowers he likes the best
282,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,That I bring from Brecon Town.
283,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
284,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"And I sit beside him -- him and me,"
285,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,(We're back to Brecon Town.)
286,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,To talk of the things that used to be
287,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,(Grey ghosts of Brecon Town);
288,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"I know the look o' the land and sky,"
289,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"And the bird that builds in the tree near by,"
290,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"And times I hear the jackals cry,"
291,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,And me in Brecon Town.
292,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
293,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,_Golden grey on miles of sand
294,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,The dawn comes creeping down;
295,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,It's day in far off Zululand
296,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,And night in Brecon Town._

301,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,The Unconquered Dead
302,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
303,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,""". . . defeated, with great loss."""
304,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
305,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
306,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Not we the conquered!  Not to us the blame
307,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Of them that flee, of them that basely yield;"
308,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Nor ours the shout of victory, the fame"
309,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Of them that vanquish in a stricken field.
310,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
311,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,That day of battle in the dusty heat
312,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,We lay and heard the bullets swish and sing
313,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Like scythes amid the over-ripened wheat,"
314,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,And we the harvest of their garnering.
315,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
316,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Some yielded, No, not we!  Not we, we swear"
317,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,By these our wounds; this trench upon the hill
318,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Where all the shell-strewn earth is seamed and bare,"
319,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Was ours to keep; and lo! we have it still.
320,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
321,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"We might have yielded, even we, but death"
322,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Came for our helper; like a sudden flood
323,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,The crashing darkness fell; our painful breath
324,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,We drew with gasps amid the choking blood.
325,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
326,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"The roar fell faint and farther off, and soon"
327,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Sank to a foolish humming in our ears,"
328,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Like crickets in the long, hot afternoon"
329,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Among the wheat fields of the olden years.
330,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
331,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Before our eyes a boundless wall of red
332,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Shot through by sudden streaks of jagged pain!
333,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Then a slow-gathering darkness overhead
334,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,And rest came on us like a quiet rain.
335,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
336,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Not we the conquered!  Not to us the shame,"
337,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Who hold our earthen ramparts, nor shall cease"
338,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"To hold them ever; victors we, who came"
339,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,In that fierce moment to our honoured peace.

346,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,1797
347,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
348,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
349,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"_Here all the day she swings from tide to tide,"
350,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Here all night long she tugs a rusted chain,"
351,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"A masterless hulk that was a ship of pride,"
352,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Yet unashamed:  her memories remain._
353,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
354,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"It was Nelson in the 'Captain', Cape St. Vincent far alee,"
355,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,With the 'Vanguard' leading s'uth'ard in the haze --
356,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Little Jervis and the Spaniards and the fight that was to be,"
357,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Twenty-seven Spanish battleships, great bullies of the sea,"
358,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,And the 'Captain' there to find her day of days.
359,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
360,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Right into them the 'Vanguard' leads, but with a sudden tack"
361,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,The Spaniards double swiftly on their trail;
362,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Now Jervis overshoots his mark, like some too eager pack,"
363,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"He will not overtake them, haste he e'er so greatly back,"
364,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,But Nelson and the 'Captain' will not fail.
365,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
366,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Like a tigress on her quarry leaps the 'Captain' from her place,"
367,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,To lie across the fleeing squadron's way:
368,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Heavy odds and heavy onslaught, gun to gun and face to face,"
369,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Win the ship a name of glory, win the men a death of grace,"
370,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,For a little hold the Spanish fleet in play.
371,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
372,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Ended now the ""Captain""'s battle, stricken sore she falls aside"
373,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Holding still her foemen, beaten to the knee:"
374,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"As the 'Vanguard' drifted past her, ""Well done, 'Captain',"" Jervis cried,"
375,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Rang the cheers of men that conquered, ran the blood of men that died,"
376,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,And the ship had won her immortality.
377,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
378,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"_Lo! here her progeny of steel and steam,"
379,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,A funnelled monster at her mooring swings:
380,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Still, in our hearts, we see her pennant stream,"
381,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"And ""Well done, 'Captain',"" like a trumpet rings._"

391,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"(I scorn your beguiling, O sea!)"
392,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Ye fondle me now, but to strike me betimes."
393,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"(A treacherous lover, the sea!)"
394,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Once I saw as I lay, half-awash in the night"
395,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,A hull in the gloom -- a quick hail -- and a light
396,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,And I lurched o'er to leeward and saved her for spite
397,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,From the doom that ye meted to me.
398,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
399,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"I was sister to 'Terrible', seventy-four,"
400,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,(Yo ho! for the swing of the sea!)
401,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,And ye sank her in fathoms a thousand or more
402,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,(Alas! for the might of the sea!)
403,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Ye taunt me and sing me her fate for a sign!
404,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,What harm can ye wreak more on me or on mine?
405,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Ho braggart!  I care not for boasting of thine --
406,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,A fig for the wrath of the sea!
407,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
408,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Some night to the lee of the land I shall steal,"
409,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,(Heigh-ho to be home from the sea!)
410,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"No pilot but Death at the rudderless wheel,"
411,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,(None knoweth the harbor as he!)
412,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,To lie where the slow tide creeps hither and fro
413,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"And the shifting sand laps me around, for I know"
414,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,That my gallant old crew are in Port long ago --
415,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,For ever at peace with the sea!

426,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Like Helen fair, like Helen light of word, --"
427,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"""The spoils unto the conquerors belong."
428,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Who winneth me must win me by the sword."""
429,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,
430,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Grown old, like Helen, once the jealous prize"
431,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"That strong men battled for in savage hate,"
432,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Can she look forth with unregretful eyes,"

442,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Beneath her window in the fragrant night
443,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,I half forget how truant years have flown
444,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Since I looked up to see her chamber-light,"
445,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Or catch, perchance, her slender shadow thrown"
446,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,Upon the casement; but the nodding leaves
447,IN FLANDERS FIELDS,"Sweep lazily across the unlit pane,"

974,JOHN MCCRAE,I. In Flanders Fields
975,JOHN MCCRAE,
976,JOHN MCCRAE,
977,JOHN MCCRAE,"""In Flanders Fields"", the piece of verse from which this little book"
978,JOHN MCCRAE,"takes its title, first appeared in 'Punch' in the issue of December"
979,JOHN MCCRAE,"8th, 1915. At the time I was living in Flanders at a convent in front"
980,JOHN MCCRAE,"of Locre, in shelter of Kemmel Hill, which lies seven miles south"
981,JOHN MCCRAE,"and slightly west of Ypres. The piece bore no signature, but it was"
982,JOHN MCCRAE,unmistakably from the hand of John McCrae.
983,JOHN MCCRAE,
984,JOHN MCCRAE,From this convent of women which was the headquarters of the 6th
985,JOHN MCCRAE,"Canadian Field Ambulance, I wrote to John McCrae, who was then at"
986,JOHN MCCRAE,"Boulogne, accusing him of the authorship, and furnished him with"
987,JOHN MCCRAE,evidence. From memory--since at the front one carries one book only--I
988,JOHN MCCRAE,"quoted to him another piece of his own verse, entitled ""The Night"
989,JOHN MCCRAE,"Cometh"":"
990,JOHN MCCRAE,
991,JOHN MCCRAE,"""Cometh the night.  The wind falls low,"
992,JOHN MCCRAE,The trees swing slowly to and fro;
993,JOHN MCCRAE,Around the church the headstones grey
994,JOHN MCCRAE,"Cluster, like children stray'd away,"
995,JOHN MCCRAE,"But found again, and folded so."""
996,JOHN MCCRAE,
997,JOHN MCCRAE,It will be observed at once by reference to the text that in form the
998,JOHN MCCRAE,two poems are identical. They contain the same number of lines and
999,JOHN MCCRAE,feet as surely as all sonnets do. Each travels upon two rhymes with the
1000,JOHN MCCRAE,members of a broken couplet in widely separated refrain. To the casual
1001,JOHN MCCRAE,"reader this much is obvious, but there are many subtleties in the verse"
1002,JOHN MCCRAE,which made the authorship inevitable. It was a form upon which he had
1003,JOHN MCCRAE,"worked for years, and made his own. When the moment arrived the medium"
1004,JOHN MCCRAE,was ready. No other medium could have so well conveyed the thought.
1005,JOHN MCCRAE,
1006,JOHN MCCRAE,This familiarity with his verse was not a matter of accident. For many
1007,JOHN MCCRAE,"years I was editor of the 'University Magazine', and those who are"
1008,JOHN MCCRAE,curious about such things may discover that one half of the poems
1009,JOHN MCCRAE,contained in this little book were first published upon its pages. This
1010,JOHN MCCRAE,"magazine had its origin in McGill University, Montreal, in the year"
1011,JOHN MCCRAE,"1902. Four years later its borders were enlarged to the wider term,"
1012,JOHN MCCRAE,and it strove to express an educated opinion upon questions immediately
1013,JOHN MCCRAE,"concerning Canada, and to treat freely in a literary way all matters"
1014,JOHN MCCRAE,"which have to do with politics, industry, philosophy, science, and art."
1015,JOHN MCCRAE,
1016,JOHN MCCRAE,To this magazine during those years John McCrae contributed all his
1017,JOHN MCCRAE,"verse. It was therefore not unseemly that I should have written to him,"
1018,JOHN MCCRAE,"when ""In Flanders Fields"" appeared in 'Punch'. Amongst his papers I find"
1019,JOHN MCCRAE,"my poor letter, and many others of which something more might be made if"
1020,JOHN MCCRAE,one were concerned merely with the literary side of his life rather than
1021,JOHN MCCRAE,with his life itself. Two references will be enough. Early in 1905 he
1022,JOHN MCCRAE,"offered ""The Pilgrims"" for publication. I notified him of the place"
1023,JOHN MCCRAE,"assigned to it in the magazine, and added a few words of appreciation,"
1024,JOHN MCCRAE,and after all these years it has come back to me.
1025,JOHN MCCRAE,
1026,JOHN MCCRAE,"The letter is dated February 9th, 1905, and reads: ""I place the poem"
1027,JOHN MCCRAE,next to my own buffoonery. It is the real stuff of poetry. How did you
1028,JOHN MCCRAE,make it? What have you to do with medicine? I was charmed with it:
1029,JOHN MCCRAE,"the thought high, the image perfect, the expression complete; not too"
1030,JOHN MCCRAE,"reticent, not too full. Videntes autem stellam gavisi sunt gaudio magno"
1031,JOHN MCCRAE,"valde. In our own tongue,--'slainte filidh'."" To his mother he wrote,"
1032,JOHN MCCRAE,"""the Latin is translatable as, 'seeing the star they rejoiced with"
1033,JOHN MCCRAE,"exceeding gladness'."" For the benefit of those whose education has"
1034,JOHN MCCRAE,"proceeded no further than the Latin, it may be explained that the two"
1035,JOHN MCCRAE,"last words mean, ""Hail to the poet""."
1036,JOHN MCCRAE,
1037,JOHN MCCRAE,To the inexperienced there is something portentous about an appearance
1038,JOHN MCCRAE,in print and something mysterious about the business of an editor.
1039,JOHN MCCRAE,"A legend has already grown up around the publication of ""In Flanders"
1040,JOHN MCCRAE,"Fields"" in 'Punch'. The truth is, ""that the poem was offered in the"
1041,JOHN MCCRAE,"usual way and accepted; that is all."" The usual way of offering a piece"
1042,JOHN MCCRAE,to an editor is to put it in an envelope with a postage stamp outside to
1043,JOHN MCCRAE,"carry it there, and a stamp inside to carry it back. Nothing else helps."
1044,JOHN MCCRAE,
1045,JOHN MCCRAE,"An editor is merely a man who knows his right hand from his left, good"
1046,JOHN MCCRAE,"from evil, having the honesty of a kitchen cook who will not spoil his"
1047,JOHN MCCRAE,"confection by favour for a friend. Fear of a foe is not a temptation,"
1048,JOHN MCCRAE,since editors are too humble and harmless to have any. There are of
1049,JOHN MCCRAE,"course certain slight offices which an editor can render, especially"
1050,JOHN MCCRAE,"to those whose writings he does not intend to print, but John McCrae"
1051,JOHN MCCRAE,required none of these. His work was finished to the last point. He
1052,JOHN MCCRAE,would bring his piece in his hand and put it on the table. A wise editor
1053,JOHN MCCRAE,knows when to keep his mouth shut; but now I am free to say that he
1054,JOHN MCCRAE,"never understood the nicety of the semi-colon, and his writing was too"
1055,JOHN MCCRAE,heavily stopped.
1056,JOHN MCCRAE,
1057,JOHN MCCRAE,"He was not of those who might say,--take it or leave it; but"
1058,JOHN MCCRAE,"rather,--look how perfect it is; and it was so. Also he was the first"
1059,JOHN MCCRAE,"to recognize that an editor has some rights and prejudices, that certain"
1060,JOHN MCCRAE,words make him sick; that certain other words he reserves for his own
1061,JOHN MCCRAE,"use,--""meticulous"" once a year, ""adscititious"" once in a life time."
1062,JOHN MCCRAE,"This explains why editors write so little. In the end, out of mere good"
1063,JOHN MCCRAE,"nature, or seeing the futility of it all, they contribute their words to"
1064,JOHN MCCRAE,contributors and write no more.
1065,JOHN MCCRAE,
1066,JOHN MCCRAE,The volume of verse as here printed is small. The volume might be
1067,JOHN MCCRAE,enlarged; it would not be improved. To estimate the value and institute
1068,JOHN MCCRAE,a comparison of those herein set forth would be a congenial but useless
1069,JOHN MCCRAE,"task, which may well be left to those whose profession it is to offer"
1070,JOHN MCCRAE,"instruction to the young. To say that ""In Flanders Fields"" is not the"
1071,JOHN MCCRAE,best would involve one in controversy. It did give expression to a mood
1072,JOHN MCCRAE,"which at the time was universal, and will remain as a permanent record"
1073,JOHN MCCRAE,when the mood is passed away.
1074,JOHN MCCRAE,
1075,JOHN MCCRAE,"The poem was first called to my attention by a Sapper officer, then"
1076,JOHN MCCRAE,"Major, now Brigadier. He brought the paper in his hand from his billet"
1077,JOHN MCCRAE,"in Dranoutre. It was printed on page 468, and Mr. 'Punch' will be glad"
1078,JOHN MCCRAE,"to be told that, in his annual index, in the issue of December 29th,"
1079,JOHN MCCRAE,"1915, he has misspelled the author's name, which is perhaps the only"
1080,JOHN MCCRAE,mistake he ever made. This officer could himself weave the sonnet with
1081,JOHN MCCRAE,"deft fingers, and he pointed out many deep things. It is to the sappers"
1082,JOHN MCCRAE,"the army always goes for ""technical material""."
1083,JOHN MCCRAE,
1084,JOHN MCCRAE,"The poem, he explained, consists of thirteen lines in iambic tetrameter"
1085,JOHN MCCRAE,"and two lines of two iambics each; in all, one line more than the"
1086,JOHN MCCRAE,"sonnet's count. There are two rhymes only, since the short lines must"
1087,JOHN MCCRAE,"be considered blank, and are, in fact, identical. But it is a difficult"
1088,JOHN MCCRAE,"mode. It is true, he allowed, that the octet of the sonnet has only two"
1089,JOHN MCCRAE,"rhymes, but these recur only four times, and the liberty of the sestet"
1090,JOHN MCCRAE,"tempers its despotism,--which I thought a pretty phrase. He pointed"
1091,JOHN MCCRAE,"out the dangers inherent in a restricted rhyme, and cited the case of"
1092,JOHN MCCRAE,"Browning, the great rhymster, who was prone to resort to any rhyme, and"
1093,JOHN MCCRAE,"frequently ended in absurdity, finding it easier to make a new verse"
1094,JOHN MCCRAE,than to make an end.
1095,JOHN MCCRAE,
1096,JOHN MCCRAE,"At great length--but the December evenings in Flanders are long, how"
1097,JOHN MCCRAE,"long, O Lord!--this Sapper officer demonstrated the skill with which the"
1098,JOHN MCCRAE,rhymes are chosen. They are vocalized. Consonant endings would spoil the
1099,JOHN MCCRAE,"whole effect. They reiterate O and I, not the O of pain and the Ay"
1100,JOHN MCCRAE,"of assent, but the O of wonder, of hope, of aspiration; and the I of"
1101,JOHN MCCRAE,"personal pride, of jealous immortality, of the Ego against the Universe."
1102,JOHN MCCRAE,"They are, he went on to expound, a recurrence of the ancient question:"
1103,JOHN MCCRAE,"""How are the dead raised, and with what body do they come?"" ""How shall I"
1104,JOHN MCCRAE,"bear my light across?"" and of the defiant cry: ""If Christ be not raised,"
1105,JOHN MCCRAE,"then is our faith vain."""
1106,JOHN MCCRAE,
1107,JOHN MCCRAE,"The theme has three phases: the first a calm, a deadly calm, opening"
1108,JOHN MCCRAE,"statement in five lines; the second in four lines, an explanation,"
1109,JOHN MCCRAE,"a regret, a reiteration of the first; the third, without preliminary"
1110,JOHN MCCRAE,"crescendo, breaking out into passionate adjuration in vivid metaphor, a"
1111,JOHN MCCRAE,poignant appeal which is at once a blessing and a curse. In the closing
1112,JOHN MCCRAE,"line is a satisfying return to the first phase,--and the thing is done."
1113,JOHN MCCRAE,"One is so often reminded of the poverty of men's invention, their"
1114,JOHN MCCRAE,"best being so incomplete, their greatest so trivial, that one welcomes"
1115,JOHN MCCRAE,what--this Sapper officer surmised--may become a new and fixed mode of
1116,JOHN MCCRAE,expression in verse.
1117,JOHN MCCRAE,
1118,JOHN MCCRAE,As to the theme itself--I am using his words: what is his is mine; what
1119,JOHN MCCRAE,"is mine is his--the interest is universal. The dead, still conscious,"
1120,JOHN MCCRAE,"fallen in a noble cause, see their graves overblown in a riot of poppy"
1121,JOHN MCCRAE,bloom. The poppy is the emblem of sleep. The dead desire to sleep
1122,JOHN MCCRAE,"undisturbed, but yet curiously take an interest in passing events. They"
1123,JOHN MCCRAE,regret that they have not been permitted to live out their life to its
1124,JOHN MCCRAE,"normal end. They call on the living to finish their task, else they"
1125,JOHN MCCRAE,"shall not sink into that complete repose which they desire, in spite"
1126,JOHN MCCRAE,of the balm of the poppy. Formalists may protest that the poet is not
1127,JOHN MCCRAE,"sincere, since it is the seed and not the flower that produces sleep."
1128,JOHN MCCRAE,They might as well object that the poet has no right to impersonate the
1129,JOHN MCCRAE,dead. We common folk know better. We know that in personating the dear
1130,JOHN MCCRAE,"dead, and calling in bell-like tones on the inarticulate living, the"
1131,JOHN MCCRAE,"poet shall be enabled to break the lightnings of the Beast, and thereby"
1132,JOHN MCCRAE,"he, being himself, alas! dead, yet speaketh; and shall speak, to ones"
1133,JOHN MCCRAE,and twos and a host. As it is written in resonant bronze: VIVOS . VOCO
1134,JOHN MCCRAE,. MORTUOS . PLANGO . FULGURA . FRANGO: words cast by this officer upon
1135,JOHN MCCRAE,a church bell which still rings in far away Orwell in memory of his
1136,JOHN MCCRAE,father--and of mine.
1137,JOHN MCCRAE,
1138,JOHN MCCRAE,By this time the little room was cold. For some reason the guns had
1139,JOHN MCCRAE,"awakened in the Salient. An Indian trooper who had just come up, and did"
1140,JOHN MCCRAE,"not yet know the orders, blew ""Lights out"",--on a cavalry trumpet."
1141,JOHN MCCRAE,The sappers work by night. The officer turned and went his way to his
1142,JOHN MCCRAE,"accursed trenches, leaving the verse with me."
1143,JOHN MCCRAE,
1144,JOHN MCCRAE,John McCrae witnessed only once the raw earth of Flanders hide its
1145,JOHN MCCRAE,shame in the warm scarlet glory of the poppy. Others have watched this
1146,JOHN MCCRAE,"resurrection of the flowers in four successive seasons, a fresh miracle"
1147,JOHN MCCRAE,every time it occurs. Also they have observed the rows of crosses
1148,JOHN MCCRAE,"lengthen, the torch thrown, caught, and carried to victory. The dead may"
1149,JOHN MCCRAE,sleep. We have not broken faith with them.
1150,JOHN MCCRAE,
1151,JOHN MCCRAE,"It is little wonder then that ""In Flanders Fields"" has become the poem"
1152,JOHN MCCRAE,"of the army. The soldiers have learned it with their hearts, which is"
1153,JOHN MCCRAE,"quite a different thing from committing it to memory. It circulates,"
1154,JOHN MCCRAE,"as a song should circulate, by the living word of mouth, not by printed"
1155,JOHN MCCRAE,"characters. That is the true test of poetry,--its insistence on making"
1156,JOHN MCCRAE,itself learnt by heart. The army has varied the text; but each variation
1157,JOHN MCCRAE,only serves to reveal more clearly the mind of the maker. The army
1158,JOHN MCCRAE,"says, ""AMONG the crosses""; ""felt dawn AND sunset glow""; ""LIVED and were"
1159,JOHN MCCRAE,"loved"". The army may be right: it usually is."
1160,JOHN MCCRAE,
1161,JOHN MCCRAE,Nor has any piece of verse in recent years been more widely known in the
1162,JOHN MCCRAE,civilian world. It was used on every platform from which men were being
1163,JOHN MCCRAE,adjured to adventure their lives or their riches in the great trial
1164,JOHN MCCRAE,"through which the present generation has passed. Many ""replies"" have"
1165,JOHN MCCRAE,been made. The best I have seen was written in the 'New York Evening
1166,JOHN MCCRAE,Post'. None but those who were prepared to die before Vimy Ridge that
1167,JOHN MCCRAE,early April day of 1916 will ever feel fully the great truth of Mr.
1168,JOHN MCCRAE,"Lillard's opening lines, as they speak for all Americans:"
1169,JOHN MCCRAE,
1170,JOHN MCCRAE,"""Rest ye in peace, ye Flanders dead."
1171,JOHN MCCRAE,The fight that ye so bravely led
1172,JOHN MCCRAE,"We've taken up."""
1173,JOHN MCCRAE,
1174,JOHN MCCRAE,"They did--and bravely. They heard the cry--""If ye break faith, we shall"
1175,JOHN MCCRAE,"not sleep."""
1176,JOHN MCCRAE,
1177,JOHN MCCRAE,
1178,JOHN MCCRAE,
1179,JOHN MCCRAE,
1180,JOHN MCCRAE,II. With the Guns
1181,JOHN MCCRAE,
1182,JOHN MCCRAE,
1183,JOHN MCCRAE,"If there was nothing remarkable about the publication of ""In Flanders"
1184,JOHN MCCRAE,"Fields"", there was something momentous in the moment of writing it."
1185,JOHN MCCRAE,And yet it was a sure instinct which prompted the writer to send it to
1186,JOHN MCCRAE,'Punch'. A rational man wishes to know the news of the world in which he
1187,JOHN MCCRAE,"lives; and if he is interested in life, he is eager to know how men feel"
1188,JOHN MCCRAE,and comport themselves amongst the events which are passing. For this
1189,JOHN MCCRAE,"purpose 'Punch' is the great newspaper of the world, and these lines"
1190,JOHN MCCRAE,describe better than any other how men felt in that great moment.
1191,JOHN MCCRAE,
1192,JOHN MCCRAE,"It was in April, 1915. The enemy was in the full cry of victory. All"
1193,JOHN MCCRAE,"that remained for him was to occupy Paris, as once he did before, and"
1194,JOHN MCCRAE,"to seize the Channel ports. Then France, England, and the world were"
1195,JOHN MCCRAE,"doomed. All winter the German had spent in repairing his plans, which"
1196,JOHN MCCRAE,"had gone somewhat awry on the Marne. He had devised his final stroke,"
1197,JOHN MCCRAE,"and it fell upon the Canadians at Ypres. This battle, known as the"
1198,JOHN MCCRAE,"second battle of Ypres, culminated on April 22nd, but it really extended"
1199,JOHN MCCRAE,over the whole month.
1200,JOHN MCCRAE,
1201,JOHN MCCRAE,The inner history of war is written from the recorded impressions of men
1202,JOHN MCCRAE,"who have endured it. John McCrae in a series of letters to his mother,"
1203,JOHN MCCRAE,"cast in the form of a diary, has set down in words the impressions which"
1204,JOHN MCCRAE,this event of the war made upon a peculiarly sensitive mind. The
1205,JOHN MCCRAE,"account is here transcribed without any attempt at ""amplification"", or"
1206,JOHN MCCRAE,"""clarifying"" by notes upon incidents or references to places. These are"
1207,JOHN MCCRAE,only too well known.
1208,JOHN MCCRAE,
1209,JOHN MCCRAE,
1210,JOHN MCCRAE,
1211,JOHN MCCRAE,"Friday, April 23rd, 1915."
1212,JOHN MCCRAE,
1213,JOHN MCCRAE,"As we moved up last evening, there was heavy firing about 4.30 on our"
1214,JOHN MCCRAE,"left, the hour at which the general attack with gas was made when the"
1215,JOHN MCCRAE,"French line broke. We could see the shells bursting over Ypres, and in"
1216,JOHN MCCRAE,"a small village to our left, meeting General----, C.R.A., of one of"
1217,JOHN MCCRAE,"the divisions, he ordered us to halt for orders. We sent forward"
1218,JOHN MCCRAE,"notifications to our Headquarters, and sent out orderlies to get in"
1219,JOHN MCCRAE,touch with the batteries of the farther forward brigades already in
1220,JOHN MCCRAE,action. The story of these guns will be read elsewhere. They had a tough
1221,JOHN MCCRAE,"time, but got away safely, and did wonderful service. One battery fired"
1222,JOHN MCCRAE,"in two opposite directions at once, and both batteries fired at point"
1223,JOHN MCCRAE,"blank, open sights, at Germans in the open. They were at times quite"
1224,JOHN MCCRAE,"without infantry on their front, for their position was behind the"
1225,JOHN MCCRAE,French to the left of the British line.
1226,JOHN MCCRAE,
1227,JOHN MCCRAE,As we sat on the road we began to see the French stragglers--men without
1228,JOHN MCCRAE,"arms, wounded men, teams, wagons, civilians, refugees--some by the"
1229,JOHN MCCRAE,"roads, some across country, all talking, shouting--the very picture of"
1230,JOHN MCCRAE,"debacle. I must say they were the ""tag enders"" of a fighting line rather"
1231,JOHN MCCRAE,"than the line itself. They streamed on, and shouted to us scraps of not"
1232,JOHN MCCRAE,"too inspiriting information while we stood and took our medicine, and"
1233,JOHN MCCRAE,picked out gun positions in the fields in case we had to go in there
1234,JOHN MCCRAE,"and then. The men were splendid; not a word; not a shake, and it was a"
1235,JOHN MCCRAE,"terrific test. Traffic whizzed by--ambulances, transport, ammunition,"
1236,JOHN MCCRAE,"supplies, despatch riders--and the shells thundered into the town, or"
1237,JOHN MCCRAE,"burst high in the air nearer us, and the refugees streamed. Women,"
1238,JOHN MCCRAE,"old men, little children, hopeless, tearful, quiet or excited, tired,"
1239,JOHN MCCRAE,"dodging the traffic,--and the wounded in singles or in groups. Here and"
1240,JOHN MCCRAE,"there I could give a momentary help, and the ambulances picked up as"
1241,JOHN MCCRAE,they could. So the cold moonlight night wore on--no change save that the
1242,JOHN MCCRAE,towers of Ypres showed up against the glare of the city burning; and the
1243,JOHN MCCRAE,shells still sailed in.
1244,JOHN MCCRAE,
1245,JOHN MCCRAE,"At 9.30 our ammunition column (the part that had been ""in"") appeared."
1246,JOHN MCCRAE,"Major---- had waited, like Casabianca, for orders until the Germans were"
1247,JOHN MCCRAE,"500 yards away; then he started, getting safely away save for one wagon"
1248,JOHN MCCRAE,"lost, and some casualties in men and horses. He found our column, and we"
1249,JOHN MCCRAE,prepared to send forward ammunition as soon as we could learn where the
1250,JOHN MCCRAE,"batteries had taken up position in retiring, for retire they had to."
1251,JOHN MCCRAE,"Eleven, twelve, and finally grey day broke, and we still waited. At"
1252,JOHN MCCRAE,3.45 word came to go in and support a French counterattack at 4.30 A.M.
1253,JOHN MCCRAE,Hastily we got the order spread; it was 4 A.M. and three miles to go.
1254,JOHN MCCRAE,
1255,JOHN MCCRAE,Of one's feelings all this night--of the asphyxiated French soldiers--of
1256,JOHN MCCRAE,"the women and children--of the cheery, steady British reinforcements"
1257,JOHN MCCRAE,"that moved up quietly past us, going up, not back--I could write, but"
1258,JOHN MCCRAE,you can imagine.
1259,JOHN MCCRAE,
1260,JOHN MCCRAE,"We took the road at once, and went up at the gallop. The Colonel rode"
1261,JOHN MCCRAE,"ahead to scout a position (we had only four guns, part of the ammunition"
1262,JOHN MCCRAE,"column, and the brigade staff; the 1st and 4th batteries were back in"
1263,JOHN MCCRAE,"reserve at our last billet). Along the roads we went, and made our place"
1264,JOHN MCCRAE,"on time, pulled up for ten minutes just short of the position, where I"
1265,JOHN MCCRAE,"put Bonfire [his horse] with my groom in a farmyard, and went forward on"
1266,JOHN MCCRAE,foot--only a quarter of a mile or so--then we advanced. Bonfire had soon
1267,JOHN MCCRAE,"to move; a shell killed a horse about four yards away from him, and he"
1268,JOHN MCCRAE,wisely took other ground. Meantime we went on into the position we were
1269,JOHN MCCRAE,"to occupy for seventeen days, though we could not guess that. I can"
1270,JOHN MCCRAE,hardly say more than that it was near the Yser Canal.
1271,JOHN MCCRAE,
1272,JOHN MCCRAE,"We got into action at once, under heavy gunfire. We were to the left"
1273,JOHN MCCRAE,"entirely of the British line, and behind French troops, and so we"
1274,JOHN MCCRAE,"remained for eight days. A Colonel of the R.A., known to fame, joined"
1275,JOHN MCCRAE,"us and camped with us; he was our link with the French Headquarters, and"
1276,JOHN MCCRAE,was in local command of the guns in this locality. When he left us eight
1277,JOHN MCCRAE,"days later he said, ""I am glad to get out of this hell-hole."" He was a"
1278,JOHN MCCRAE,"great comfort to us, for he is very capable, and the entire battle was"
1279,JOHN MCCRAE,"largely fought ""on our own"", following the requests of the Infantry on"
1280,JOHN MCCRAE,"our front, and scarcely guided by our own staff at all. We at once set"
1281,JOHN MCCRAE,"out to register our targets, and almost at once had to get into steady"
1282,JOHN MCCRAE,firing on quite a large sector of front. We dug in the guns as quickly
1283,JOHN MCCRAE,"as we could, and took as Headquarters some infantry trenches already"
1284,JOHN MCCRAE,sunk on a ridge near the canal. We were subject from the first to a
1285,JOHN MCCRAE,"steady and accurate shelling, for we were all but in sight, as were the"
1286,JOHN MCCRAE,German trenches about 2000 yards to our front. At times the fire would
1287,JOHN MCCRAE,come in salvos quickly repeated. Bursts of fire would be made for ten
1288,JOHN MCCRAE,"or fifteen minutes at a time. We got all varieties of projectile, from"
1289,JOHN MCCRAE,"3 inch to 8 inch, or perhaps 10 inch; the small ones usually as air"
1290,JOHN MCCRAE,"bursts, the larger percussion and air, and the heaviest percussion only."
1291,JOHN MCCRAE,
1292,JOHN MCCRAE,"My work began almost from the start--steady but never overwhelming,"
1293,JOHN MCCRAE,except perhaps once for a few minutes. A little cottage behind our ridge
1294,JOHN MCCRAE,"served as a cook-house, but was so heavily hit the second day that we"
1295,JOHN MCCRAE,had to be chary of it. During bursts of fire I usually took the back
1296,JOHN MCCRAE,slope of the sharply crested ridge for what shelter it offered. At 3 our
1297,JOHN MCCRAE,"1st and 4th arrived, and went into action at once a few hundred yards in"
1298,JOHN MCCRAE,"our rear. Wires were at once put out, to be cut by shells hundreds and"
1299,JOHN MCCRAE,"hundreds of times, but always repaired by our indefatigable linemen."
1300,JOHN MCCRAE,So the day wore on; in the night the shelling still kept up: three
1301,JOHN MCCRAE,different German attacks were made and repulsed. If we suffered by
1302,JOHN MCCRAE,"being close up, the Germans suffered from us, for already tales of good"
1303,JOHN MCCRAE,"shooting came down to us. I got some sleep despite the constant firing,"
1304,JOHN MCCRAE,for we had none last night.
1305,JOHN MCCRAE,
1306,JOHN MCCRAE,
1307,JOHN MCCRAE,
1308,JOHN MCCRAE,"Saturday, April 24th, 1915."
1309,JOHN MCCRAE,
1310,JOHN MCCRAE,Behold us now anything less than two miles north of Ypres on the west
1311,JOHN MCCRAE,"side of the canal; this runs north, each bank flanked with high elms,"
1312,JOHN MCCRAE,with bare trunks of the familiar Netherlands type. A few yards to the
1313,JOHN MCCRAE,"West a main road runs, likewise bordered; the Censor will allow me to"
1314,JOHN MCCRAE,say that on the high bank between these we had our headquarters; the
1315,JOHN MCCRAE,"ridge is perhaps fifteen to twenty feet high, and slopes forward fifty"
1316,JOHN MCCRAE,"yards to the water, the back is more steep, and slopes quickly to a"
1317,JOHN MCCRAE,"little subsidiary water way, deep but dirty. Where the guns were I shall"
1318,JOHN MCCRAE,"not say; but they were not far, and the German aeroplanes that viewed"
1319,JOHN MCCRAE,us daily with all but impunity knew very well. A road crossed over
1320,JOHN MCCRAE,"the canal, and interrupted the ridge; across the road from us was our"
1321,JOHN MCCRAE,"billet--the place we cooked in, at least, and where we usually took our"
1322,JOHN MCCRAE,"meals. Looking to the south between the trees, we could see the ruins"
1323,JOHN MCCRAE,"of the city: to the front on the sky line, with rolling ground in the"
1324,JOHN MCCRAE,"front, pitted by French trenches, the German lines; to the left front,"
1325,JOHN MCCRAE,"several farms and a windmill, and farther left, again near the canal,"
1326,JOHN MCCRAE,thicker trees and more farms. The farms and windmills were soon burnt.
1327,JOHN MCCRAE,Several farms we used for observing posts were also quickly burnt during
1328,JOHN MCCRAE,the next three or four days. All along behind us at varying distances
1329,JOHN MCCRAE,French and British guns; the flashes at night lit up the sky.
1330,JOHN MCCRAE,
1331,JOHN MCCRAE,These high trees were at once a protection and a danger. Shells that
1332,JOHN MCCRAE,struck them were usually destructive. When we came in the foliage was
1333,JOHN MCCRAE,"still very thin. Along the road, which was constantly shelled ""on spec"""
1334,JOHN MCCRAE,"by the Germans, one saw all the sights of war: wounded men limping"
1335,JOHN MCCRAE,"or carried, ambulances, trains of supply, troops, army mules, and"
1336,JOHN MCCRAE,tragedies. I saw one bicycle orderly: a shell exploded and he seemed
1337,JOHN MCCRAE,to pedal on for eight or ten revolutions and then collapsed in a
1338,JOHN MCCRAE,"heap--dead. Straggling soldiers would be killed or wounded, horses"
1339,JOHN MCCRAE,"also, until it got to be a nightmare. I used to shudder every time I"
1340,JOHN MCCRAE,saw wagons or troops on that road. My dugout looked out on it. I got
1341,JOHN MCCRAE,"a square hole, 8 by 8, dug in the side of the hill (west), roofed over"
1342,JOHN MCCRAE,"with remnants to keep out the rain, and a little sandbag parapet on"
1343,JOHN MCCRAE,"the back to prevent pieces of ""back-kick shells"" from coming in, or"
1344,JOHN MCCRAE,prematures from our own or the French guns for that matter. Some straw
1345,JOHN MCCRAE,on the floor completed it. The ground was treacherous and a slip the
1346,JOHN MCCRAE,first night nearly buried----. So we had to be content with walls
1347,JOHN MCCRAE,"straight up and down, and trust to the height of the bank for safety."
1348,JOHN MCCRAE,"All places along the bank were more or less alike, all squirrel holes."
1349,JOHN MCCRAE,
1350,JOHN MCCRAE,This morning we supported a heavy French attack at 4.30; there had
1351,JOHN MCCRAE,"been three German attacks in the night, and everyone was tired. We"
1352,JOHN MCCRAE,got heavily shelled. In all eight or ten of our trees were cut by
1353,JOHN MCCRAE,"shells--cut right off, the upper part of the tree subsiding heavily and"
1354,JOHN MCCRAE,"straight down, as a usual thing. One would think a piece a foot long"
1355,JOHN MCCRAE,was just instantly cut out; and these trees were about 18 inches in
1356,JOHN MCCRAE,diameter. The gas fumes came very heavily: some blew down from the
1357,JOHN MCCRAE,"infantry trenches, some came from the shells: one's eyes smarted, and"
1358,JOHN MCCRAE,breathing was very laboured. Up to noon to-day we fired 2500 rounds.
1359,JOHN MCCRAE,Last night Col. Morrison and I slept at a French Colonel's headquarters
1360,JOHN MCCRAE,"near by, and in the night our room was filled up with wounded. I woke up"
1361,JOHN MCCRAE,"and shared my bed with a chap with ""a wounded leg and a chill"". Probably"
1362,JOHN MCCRAE,thirty wounded were brought into the one little room.
1363,JOHN MCCRAE,
1364,JOHN MCCRAE,"Col.----, R.A., kept us in communication with the French General in"
1365,JOHN MCCRAE,whose command we were. I bunked down in the trench on the top of the
1366,JOHN MCCRAE,"ridge: the sky was red with the glare of the city still burning, and we"
1367,JOHN MCCRAE,could hear the almost constant procession of large shells sailing over
1368,JOHN MCCRAE,from our left front into the city: the crashes of their explosion shook
1369,JOHN MCCRAE,"the ground where we were. After a terribly hard day, professionally and"
1370,JOHN MCCRAE,"otherwise, I slept well, but it rained and the trench was awfully muddy"
1371,JOHN MCCRAE,and wet.
1372,JOHN MCCRAE,
1373,JOHN MCCRAE,
1374,JOHN MCCRAE,
1375,JOHN MCCRAE,"Sunday, April 25th, 1915."
1376,JOHN MCCRAE,
1377,JOHN MCCRAE,"The weather brightened up, and we got at it again. This day we had"
1378,JOHN MCCRAE,"several heavy attacks, prefaced by heavy artillery fire; these bursts"
1379,JOHN MCCRAE,of fire would result in our getting 100 to 150 rounds right on us or
1380,JOHN MCCRAE,nearby: the heavier our fire (which was on the trenches entirely) the
1381,JOHN MCCRAE,heavier theirs.
1382,JOHN MCCRAE,
1383,JOHN MCCRAE,"Our food supply came up at dusk in wagons, and the water was any we"
1384,JOHN MCCRAE,"could get, but of course treated with chloride of lime. The ammunition"
1385,JOHN MCCRAE,"had to be brought down the roads at the gallop, and the more firing the"
1386,JOHN MCCRAE,"more wagons. The men would quickly carry the rounds to the guns, as"
1387,JOHN MCCRAE,the wagons had to halt behind our hill. The good old horses would swing
1388,JOHN MCCRAE,"around at the gallop, pull up in an instant, and stand puffing and"
1389,JOHN MCCRAE,"blowing, but with their heads up, as if to say, ""Wasn't that well done?"""
1390,JOHN MCCRAE,"It makes you want to kiss their dear old noses, and assure them of a"
1391,JOHN MCCRAE,peaceful pasture once more. To-day we got our dressing station dugout
1392,JOHN MCCRAE,"complete, and slept there at night."
1393,JOHN MCCRAE,
1394,JOHN MCCRAE,Three farms in succession burned on our front--colour in the otherwise
1395,JOHN MCCRAE,dark. The flashes of shells over the front and rear in all directions.
1396,JOHN MCCRAE,The city still burning and the procession still going on. I dressed a
1397,JOHN MCCRAE,number of French wounded; one Turco prayed to Allah and Mohammed all the
1398,JOHN MCCRAE,time I was dressing his wound. On the front field one can see the dead
1399,JOHN MCCRAE,"lying here and there, and in places where an assault has been they lie"
1400,JOHN MCCRAE,very thick on the front slopes of the German trenches. Our telephone
1401,JOHN MCCRAE,wagon team hit by a shell; two horses killed and another wounded. I did
1402,JOHN MCCRAE,"what I could for the wounded one, and he subsequently got well. This"
1403,JOHN MCCRAE,"night, beginning after dark, we got a terrible shelling, which kept up"
1404,JOHN MCCRAE,"till 2 or 3 in the morning. Finally I got to sleep, though it was still"
1405,JOHN MCCRAE,"going on. We must have got a couple of hundred rounds, in single or"
1406,JOHN MCCRAE,"pairs. Every one burst over us, would light up the dugout, and every hit"
1407,JOHN MCCRAE,in front would shake the ground and bring down small bits of earth on
1408,JOHN MCCRAE,"us, or else the earth thrown into the air by the explosion would come"
1409,JOHN MCCRAE,"spattering down on our roof, and into the front of the dugout. Col."
1410,JOHN MCCRAE,"Morrison tried the mess house, but the shelling was too heavy, and he"
1411,JOHN MCCRAE,"and the adjutant joined Cosgrave and me, and we four spent an anxious"
1412,JOHN MCCRAE,"night there in the dark. One officer was on watch ""on the bridge"" (as we"
1413,JOHN MCCRAE,called the trench at the top of the ridge) with the telephones.
1414,JOHN MCCRAE,
1415,JOHN MCCRAE,
1416,JOHN MCCRAE,
1417,JOHN MCCRAE,"Monday, April 26th, 1915."
1418,JOHN MCCRAE,
1419,JOHN MCCRAE,"Another day of heavy actions, but last night much French and British"
1420,JOHN MCCRAE,"artillery has come in, and the place is thick with Germans. There are"
1421,JOHN MCCRAE,many prematures (with so much firing) but the pieces are usually spread
1422,JOHN MCCRAE,"before they get to us. It is disquieting, however, I must say. And all"
1423,JOHN MCCRAE,the time the birds sing in the trees over our heads. Yesterday up to
1424,JOHN MCCRAE,noon we fired 3000 rounds for the twenty-four hours; to-day we have
1425,JOHN MCCRAE,"fired much less, but we have registered fresh fronts, and burned some"
1426,JOHN MCCRAE,"farms behind the German trenches. About six the fire died down, and we"
1427,JOHN MCCRAE,"had a peaceful evening and night, and Cosgrave and I in the dugout made"
1428,JOHN MCCRAE,"good use of it. The Colonel has an individual dugout, and Dodds sleeps"
1429,JOHN MCCRAE,"""topside"" in the trench. To all this, put in a background of anxiety"
1430,JOHN MCCRAE,"lest the line break, for we are just where it broke before."
1431,JOHN MCCRAE,
1432,JOHN MCCRAE,
1433,JOHN MCCRAE,
1434,JOHN MCCRAE,"Tuesday, April 27th, 1915."
1435,JOHN MCCRAE,
1436,JOHN MCCRAE,This morning again registering batteries on new points. At 1.30 a heavy
1437,JOHN MCCRAE,attack was prepared by the French and ourselves. The fire was very heavy
1438,JOHN MCCRAE,for half an hour and the enemy got busy too. I had to cross over to
1439,JOHN MCCRAE,"the batteries during it, an unpleasant journey. More gas attacks in the"
1440,JOHN MCCRAE,"afternoon. The French did not appear to press the attack hard, but in"
1441,JOHN MCCRAE,the light of subsequent events it probably was only a feint. It seems
1442,JOHN MCCRAE,likely that about this time our people began to thin out the artillery
1443,JOHN MCCRAE,again for use elsewhere; but this did not at once become apparent. At
1444,JOHN MCCRAE,"night usually the heavies farther back take up the story, and there is"
1445,JOHN MCCRAE,a duel. The Germans fire on our roads after dark to catch reliefs and
1446,JOHN MCCRAE,transport. I suppose ours do the same.
1447,JOHN MCCRAE,
1448,JOHN MCCRAE,
1449,JOHN MCCRAE,
1450,JOHN MCCRAE,"Wednesday, April 28th, 1915."
1451,JOHN MCCRAE,
1452,JOHN MCCRAE,I have to confess to an excellent sleep last night. At times anxiety
1453,JOHN MCCRAE,"says, ""I don't want a meal,"" but experience says ""you need your food,"""
1454,JOHN MCCRAE,so I attend regularly to that. The billet is not too safe either. Much
1455,JOHN MCCRAE,"German air reconnaissance over us, and heavy firing from both sides"
1456,JOHN MCCRAE,"during the day. At 6.45 we again prepared a heavy artillery attack, but"
1457,JOHN MCCRAE,"the infantry made little attempt to go on. We are perhaps the ""chopping"
1458,JOHN MCCRAE,"block"", and our ""preparations"" may be chiefly designed to prevent"
1459,JOHN MCCRAE,detachments of troops being sent from our front elsewhere.
1460,JOHN MCCRAE,
1461,JOHN MCCRAE,I have said nothing of what goes on on our right and left; but it is
1462,JOHN MCCRAE,equally part and parcel of the whole game; this eight mile front is
1463,JOHN MCCRAE,"constantly heavily engaged. At intervals, too, they bombard Ypres. Our"
1464,JOHN MCCRAE,"back lines, too, have to be constantly shifted on account of shell fire,"
1465,JOHN MCCRAE,and we have desultory but constant losses there. In the evening rifle
1466,JOHN MCCRAE,"fire gets more frequent, and bullets are constantly singing over us."
1467,JOHN MCCRAE,"Some of them are probably ricochets, for we are 1800 yards, or nearly,"
1468,JOHN MCCRAE,from the nearest German trench.
1469,JOHN MCCRAE,
1470,JOHN MCCRAE,
1471,JOHN MCCRAE,
1472,JOHN MCCRAE,"Thursday, April 29th, 1915."
1473,JOHN MCCRAE,
1474,JOHN MCCRAE,"This morning our billet was hit. We fire less these days, but still"
1475,JOHN MCCRAE,"a good deal. There was a heavy French attack on our left. The ""gas"""
1476,JOHN MCCRAE,attacks can be seen from here. The yellow cloud rising up is for us a
1477,JOHN MCCRAE,"signal to open, and we do. The wind is from our side to-day, and a good"
1478,JOHN MCCRAE,"thing it is. Several days ago during the firing a big Oxford-grey dog,"
1479,JOHN MCCRAE,"with beautiful brown eyes, came to us in a panic. He ran to me, and"
1480,JOHN MCCRAE,pressed his head HARD against my leg. So I got him a safe place and he
1481,JOHN MCCRAE,"sticks by us. We call him Fleabag, for he looks like it."
1482,JOHN MCCRAE,
1483,JOHN MCCRAE,This night they shelled us again heavily for some hours--the same
1484,JOHN MCCRAE,"shorts, hits, overs on percussion, and great yellow-green air bursts."
1485,JOHN MCCRAE,One feels awfully irritated by the constant din--a mixture of anger and
1486,JOHN MCCRAE,apprehension.
1487,JOHN MCCRAE,
1488,JOHN MCCRAE,
1489,JOHN MCCRAE,
1490,JOHN MCCRAE,"Friday, April 30th, 1915."
1491,JOHN MCCRAE,
1492,JOHN MCCRAE,"Thick mist this morning, and relative quietness; but before it cleared"
1493,JOHN MCCRAE,"the Germans started again to shell us. At 10 it cleared, and from 10 to"
1494,JOHN MCCRAE,"2 we fired constantly. The French advanced, and took some ground on our"
1495,JOHN MCCRAE,left front and a batch of prisoners. This was at a place we call Twin
1496,JOHN MCCRAE,Farms. Our men looked curiously at the Boches as they were marched
1497,JOHN MCCRAE,through. Some better activity in the afternoon by the Allies'
1498,JOHN MCCRAE,aeroplanes. The German planes have had it too much their way lately.
1499,JOHN MCCRAE,Many of to-day's shells have been very large--10 or 12 inch; a lot of
1500,JOHN MCCRAE,tremendous holes dug in the fields just behind us.
1501,JOHN MCCRAE,
1502,JOHN MCCRAE,
1503,JOHN MCCRAE,
1504,JOHN MCCRAE,"Saturday, May 1st, 1915."
1505,JOHN MCCRAE,
1506,JOHN MCCRAE,May day! Heavy bombardment at intervals through the day. Another
1507,JOHN MCCRAE,"heavy artillery preparation at 3.25, but no French advance. We fail"
1508,JOHN MCCRAE,"to understand why, but orders go. We suffered somewhat during the day."
1509,JOHN MCCRAE,Through the evening and night heavy firing at intervals.
1510,JOHN MCCRAE,
1511,JOHN MCCRAE,
1512,JOHN MCCRAE,
1513,JOHN MCCRAE,"Sunday, May 2nd, 1915."
1514,JOHN MCCRAE,
1515,JOHN MCCRAE,Heavy gunfire again this morning. Lieut. H---- was killed at the guns.
1516,JOHN MCCRAE,"His diary's last words were, ""It has quieted a little and I shall try to"
1517,JOHN MCCRAE,"get a good sleep."" I said the Committal Service over him, as well as"
1518,JOHN MCCRAE,I could from memory. A soldier's death! Batteries again registering
1519,JOHN MCCRAE,"barrages or barriers of fire at set ranges. At 3 the Germans attacked,"
1520,JOHN MCCRAE,"preceded by gas clouds. Fighting went on for an hour and a half, during"
1521,JOHN MCCRAE,which their guns hammered heavily with some loss to us. The French lines
1522,JOHN MCCRAE,"are very uneasy, and we are correspondingly anxious. The infantry fire"
1523,JOHN MCCRAE,"was very heavy, and we fired incessantly, keeping on into the night."
1524,JOHN MCCRAE,"Despite the heavy fire I got asleep at 12, and slept until daylight"
1525,JOHN MCCRAE,which comes at 3.
1526,JOHN MCCRAE,
1527,JOHN MCCRAE,
1528,JOHN MCCRAE,
1529,JOHN MCCRAE,"Monday, May 3rd, 1915."
1530,JOHN MCCRAE,
1531,JOHN MCCRAE,"A clear morning, and the accursed German aeroplanes over our positions"
1532,JOHN MCCRAE,"again. They are usually fired at, but no luck. To-day a shell on our"
1533,JOHN MCCRAE,hill dug out a cannon ball about six inches in diameter--probably of
1534,JOHN MCCRAE,"Napoleon's or earlier times--heavily rusted. A German attack began, but"
1535,JOHN MCCRAE,"half an hour of artillery fire drove it back. Major----, R.A., was up"
1536,JOHN MCCRAE,"forward, and could see the German reserves. Our 4th was turned on: first"
1537,JOHN MCCRAE,"round 100 over; shortened and went into gunfire, and his report was"
1538,JOHN MCCRAE,"that the effect was perfect. The same occurred again in the evening, and"
1539,JOHN MCCRAE,again at midnight. The Germans were reported to be constantly massing
1540,JOHN MCCRAE,"for attack, and we as constantly ""went to them"". The German guns shelled"
1541,JOHN MCCRAE,us as usual at intervals. This must get very tiresome to read; but
1542,JOHN MCCRAE,"through it all, it must be mentioned that the constantly broken"
1543,JOHN MCCRAE,"communications have to be mended, rations and ammunition brought up,"
1544,JOHN MCCRAE,the wounded to be dressed and got away. Our dugouts have the French
1545,JOHN MCCRAE,Engineers and French Infantry next door by turns. They march in and
1546,JOHN MCCRAE,"out. The back of the hill is a network of wires, so that one has to go"
1547,JOHN MCCRAE,carefully.
1548,JOHN MCCRAE,
1549,JOHN MCCRAE,
1550,JOHN MCCRAE,
1551,JOHN MCCRAE,"Tuesday, May 4th, 1915."
1552,JOHN MCCRAE,
1553,JOHN MCCRAE,Despite intermittent shelling and some casualties the quietest day yet;
1554,JOHN MCCRAE,but we live in an uneasy atmosphere as German attacks are constantly
1555,JOHN MCCRAE,"being projected, and our communications are interrupted and scrappy. We"
1556,JOHN MCCRAE,get no news of any sort and have just to sit tight and hold on. Evening
1557,JOHN MCCRAE,closed in rainy and dark. Our dugout is very slenderly provided against
1558,JOHN MCCRAE,"it, and we get pretty wet and very dirty. In the quieter morning hours"
1559,JOHN MCCRAE,we get a chance of a wash and occasionally a shave.
1560,JOHN MCCRAE,
1561,JOHN MCCRAE,
1562,JOHN MCCRAE,
1563,JOHN MCCRAE,"Wednesday, May 5th, 1915."
1564,JOHN MCCRAE,
1565,JOHN MCCRAE,"Heavily hammered in the morning from 7 to 9, but at 9 it let up; the"
1566,JOHN MCCRAE,sun came out and things looked better. Evidently our line has again been
1567,JOHN MCCRAE,thinned of artillery and the requisite minimum to hold is left. There
1568,JOHN MCCRAE,"were German attacks to our right, just out of our area. Later on we and"
1569,JOHN MCCRAE,"they both fired heavily, the first battery getting it especially"
1570,JOHN MCCRAE,"hot. The planes over us again and again, to coach the guns. An attack"
1571,JOHN MCCRAE,"expected at dusk, but it turned only to heavy night shelling, so that"
1572,JOHN MCCRAE,"with our fire, theirs, and the infantry cracking away constantly, we got"
1573,JOHN MCCRAE,sleep in small quantity all night; bullets whizzing over us constantly.
1574,JOHN MCCRAE,"Heavy rain from 5 to 8, and everything wet except the far-in corner of"
1575,JOHN MCCRAE,"the dugout, where we mass our things to keep them as dry as we may."
1576,JOHN MCCRAE,
1577,JOHN MCCRAE,
1578,JOHN MCCRAE,
1579,JOHN MCCRAE,"Thursday, May 6th, 1915."
1580,JOHN MCCRAE,
1581,JOHN MCCRAE,After the rain a bright morning; the leaves and blossoms are coming out.
1582,JOHN MCCRAE,We ascribe our quietude to a welcome flock of allied planes which are
1583,JOHN MCCRAE,"over this morning. The Germans attacked at eleven, and again at six in"
1584,JOHN MCCRAE,"the afternoon, each meaning a waking up of heavy artillery on the whole"
1585,JOHN MCCRAE,"front. In the evening we had a little rain at intervals, but it was"
1586,JOHN MCCRAE,light.
1587,JOHN MCCRAE,
1588,JOHN MCCRAE,
1589,JOHN MCCRAE,
1590,JOHN MCCRAE,"Friday, May 7th, 1915."
1591,JOHN MCCRAE,
1592,JOHN MCCRAE,"A bright morning early, but clouded over later. The Germans gave it to"
1593,JOHN MCCRAE,us very heavily. There was heavy fighting to the south-east of us. Two
1594,JOHN MCCRAE,"attacks or threats, and we went in again."
1595,JOHN MCCRAE,
1596,JOHN MCCRAE,
1597,JOHN MCCRAE,
1598,JOHN MCCRAE,"Saturday, May 8th, 1915."
1599,JOHN MCCRAE,
1600,JOHN MCCRAE,"For the last three days we have been under British divisional control,"
1601,JOHN MCCRAE,"and supporting our own men who have been put farther to the left, till"
1602,JOHN MCCRAE,they are almost in front of us. It is an added comfort. We have four
1603,JOHN MCCRAE,officers out with various infantry regiments for observation and
1604,JOHN MCCRAE,"co-operation; they have to stick it in trenches, as all the houses and"
1605,JOHN MCCRAE,barns are burned. The whole front is constantly ablaze with big gunfire;
1606,JOHN MCCRAE,the racket never ceases. We have now to do most of the work for our
1607,JOHN MCCRAE,"left, as our line appears to be much thinner than it was. A German"
1608,JOHN MCCRAE,"attack followed the shelling at 7; we were fighting hard till 12, and"
1609,JOHN MCCRAE,"less regularly all the afternoon. We suffered much, and at one time were"
1610,JOHN MCCRAE,"down to seven guns. Of these two were smoking at every joint, and the"
1611,JOHN MCCRAE,levers were so hot that the gunners used sacking for their hands. The
1612,JOHN MCCRAE,"pace is now much hotter, and the needs of the infantry for fire more"
1613,JOHN MCCRAE,"insistent. The guns are in bad shape by reason of dirt, injuries, and"
1614,JOHN MCCRAE,"heat. The wind fortunately blows from us, so there is no gas, but the"
1615,JOHN MCCRAE,"attacks are still very heavy. Evening brought a little quiet, but very"
1616,JOHN MCCRAE,disquieting news (which afterwards proved untrue); and we had to face
1617,JOHN MCCRAE,"a possible retirement. You may imagine our state of mind, unable to get"
1618,JOHN MCCRAE,"anything sure in the uncertainty, except that we should stick out as"
1619,JOHN MCCRAE,"long as the guns would fire, and we could fire them. That sort of night"
1620,JOHN MCCRAE,"brings a man down to his ""bare skin"", I promise you. The night was very"
1621,JOHN MCCRAE,"cold, and not a cheerful one."
1622,JOHN MCCRAE,
1623,JOHN MCCRAE,
1624,JOHN MCCRAE,
1625,JOHN MCCRAE,"Sunday, May 9th, 1915."
1626,JOHN MCCRAE,
1627,JOHN MCCRAE,"At 4 we were ordered to get ready to move, and the Adjutant picked out"
1628,JOHN MCCRAE,"new retirement positions; but a little later better news came, and the"
1629,JOHN MCCRAE,daylight and sun revived us a bit. As I sat in my dugout a little white
1630,JOHN MCCRAE,"and black dog with tan spots bolted in over the parapet, during heavy"
1631,JOHN MCCRAE,"firing, and going to the farthest corner began to dig furiously. Having"
1632,JOHN MCCRAE,"scraped out a pathetic little hole two inches deep, she sat down and"
1633,JOHN MCCRAE,"shook, looking most plaintively at me. A few minutes later, her owner"
1634,JOHN MCCRAE,"came along, a French soldier. Bissac was her name, but she would not"
1635,JOHN MCCRAE,"leave me at the time. When I sat down a little later, she stole out and"
1636,JOHN MCCRAE,"shyly crawled in between me and the wall; she stayed by me all day, and"
1637,JOHN MCCRAE,I hope got later on to safe quarters.
1638,JOHN MCCRAE,
1639,JOHN MCCRAE,"Firing kept up all day. In thirty hours we had fired 3600 rounds, and"
1640,JOHN MCCRAE,"at times with seven, eight, or nine guns; our wire cut and repaired"
1641,JOHN MCCRAE,"eighteen times. Orders came to move, and we got ready. At dusk we got"
1642,JOHN MCCRAE,"the guns out by hand, and all batteries assembled at a given spot in"
1643,JOHN MCCRAE,"comparative safety. We were much afraid they would open on us, for at 10"
1644,JOHN MCCRAE,"o'clock they gave us 100 or 150 rounds, hitting the trench parapet again"
1645,JOHN MCCRAE,"and again. However, we were up the road, the last wagon half a mile"
1646,JOHN MCCRAE,"away before they opened. One burst near me, and splattered some pieces"
1647,JOHN MCCRAE,"around, but we got clear, and by 12 were out of the usual fire zone."
1648,JOHN MCCRAE,"Marched all night, tired as could be, but happy to be clear."
1649,JOHN MCCRAE,
1650,JOHN MCCRAE,I was glad to get on dear old Bonfire again. We made about sixteen
1651,JOHN MCCRAE,"miles, and got to our billets at dawn. I had three or four hours'"
1652,JOHN MCCRAE,"sleep, and arose to a peaceful breakfast. We shall go back to the line"
1653,JOHN MCCRAE,"elsewhere very soon, but it is a present relief, and the next place is"
1654,JOHN MCCRAE,"sure to be better, for it cannot be worse. Much of this narrative is"
1655,JOHN MCCRAE,"bald and plain, but it tells our part in a really great battle. I have"
1656,JOHN MCCRAE,only had hasty notes to go by; in conversation there is much one could
1657,JOHN MCCRAE,say that would be of greater interest. Heard of the 'Lusitania' disaster
1658,JOHN MCCRAE,on our road out. A terrible affair!
1659,JOHN MCCRAE,
1660,JOHN MCCRAE,
1661,JOHN MCCRAE,
1662,JOHN MCCRAE,
1663,JOHN MCCRAE,"Here ends the account of his part in this memorable battle,"
1664,JOHN MCCRAE,
1665,JOHN MCCRAE,
1666,JOHN MCCRAE,
1667,JOHN MCCRAE,
1668,JOHN MCCRAE,And here follow some general observations upon the experience:
1669,JOHN MCCRAE,
1670,JOHN MCCRAE,
1671,JOHN MCCRAE,
1672,JOHN MCCRAE,"Northern France, May 10th, 1915."
1673,JOHN MCCRAE,
1674,JOHN MCCRAE,"We got here to refit and rest this morning at 4, having marched last"
1675,JOHN MCCRAE,night at 10. The general impression in my mind is of a nightmare. We
1676,JOHN MCCRAE,have been in the most bitter of fights. For seventeen days and seventeen
1677,JOHN MCCRAE,"nights none of us have had our clothes off, nor our boots even, except"
1678,JOHN MCCRAE,"occasionally. In all that time while I was awake, gunfire and rifle fire"
1679,JOHN MCCRAE,"never ceased for sixty seconds, and it was sticking to our utmost by a"
1680,JOHN MCCRAE,"weak line all but ready to break, knowing nothing of what was going on,"
1681,JOHN MCCRAE,and depressed by reports of anxious infantry. The men and the divisions
1682,JOHN MCCRAE,are worthy of all praise that can be given. It did not end in four days
1683,JOHN MCCRAE,when many of our infantry were taken out. It kept on at fever heat till
1684,JOHN MCCRAE,yesterday.
1685,JOHN MCCRAE,
1686,JOHN MCCRAE,"This, of course, is the second battle of Ypres, or the battle of the"
1687,JOHN MCCRAE,"Yser, I do not know which. At one time we were down to seven guns,"
1688,JOHN MCCRAE,"but those guns were smoking at every joint, the gunners using cloth to"
1689,JOHN MCCRAE,handle the breech levers because of the heat. We had three batteries in
1690,JOHN MCCRAE,action with four guns added from the other units. Our casualties were
1691,JOHN MCCRAE,half the number of men in the firing line. The horse lines and the wagon
1692,JOHN MCCRAE,"lines farther back suffered less, but the Brigade list has gone far"
1693,JOHN MCCRAE,higher than any artillery normal. I know one brigade R.A. that was in
1694,JOHN MCCRAE,the Mons retreat and had about the same. I have done what fell to hand.
1695,JOHN MCCRAE,"My clothes, boots, kit, and dugout at various times were sadly bloody."
1696,JOHN MCCRAE,Two of our batteries are reduced to two officers each. We have had
1697,JOHN MCCRAE,"constant accurate shell-fire, but we have given back no less. And"
1698,JOHN MCCRAE,"behind it all was the constant background of the sights of the dead, the"
1699,JOHN MCCRAE,"wounded, the maimed, and a terrible anxiety lest the line should give"
1700,JOHN MCCRAE,way.
1701,JOHN MCCRAE,
1702,JOHN MCCRAE,"During all this time, we have been behind French troops, and only"
1703,JOHN MCCRAE,helping our own people by oblique fire when necessary. Our horses have
1704,JOHN MCCRAE,suffered heavily too. Bonfire had a light wound from a piece of shell;
1705,JOHN MCCRAE,it is healing and the dear old fellow is very fit. Had my first ride
1706,JOHN MCCRAE,for seventeen days last night. We never saw horses but with the wagons
1707,JOHN MCCRAE,bringing up the ammunition. When fire was hottest they had to come two
1708,JOHN MCCRAE,"miles on a road terribly swept, and they did it magnificently. But how"
1709,JOHN MCCRAE,tired we are! Weary in body and wearier in mind. None of our men went
1710,JOHN MCCRAE,off their heads but men in units nearby did--and no wonder.
1711,JOHN MCCRAE,
1712,JOHN MCCRAE,
1713,JOHN MCCRAE,
1714,JOHN MCCRAE,"France, May 12th, 1915."
1715,JOHN MCCRAE,
1716,JOHN MCCRAE,I am glad you had your mind at rest by the rumour that we were in
1717,JOHN MCCRAE,reserve. What newspaper work! The poor old artillery never gets any
1718,JOHN MCCRAE,"mention, and the whole show is the infantry. It may interest you to"
1719,JOHN MCCRAE,"note on your map a spot on the west bank of the canal, a mile and a half"
1720,JOHN MCCRAE,"north of Ypres, as the scene of our labours. There can be no harm in"
1721,JOHN MCCRAE,"saying so, now that we are out of it. The unit was the most advanced"
1722,JOHN MCCRAE,of all the Allies' guns by a good deal except one French battery which
1723,JOHN MCCRAE,"stayed in a position yet more advanced for two days, and then had to be"
1724,JOHN MCCRAE,taken out. I think it may be said that we saw the show from the soup to
1725,JOHN MCCRAE,the coffee.
1726,JOHN MCCRAE,
1727,JOHN MCCRAE,
1728,JOHN MCCRAE,
1729,JOHN MCCRAE,"France, May 17th, 1915."
1730,JOHN MCCRAE,
1731,JOHN MCCRAE,The farther we get away from Ypres the more we learn of the enormous
1732,JOHN MCCRAE,power the Germans put in to push us over. Lord only knows how many men
1733,JOHN MCCRAE,"they had, and how many they lost. I wish I could embody on paper some of"
1734,JOHN MCCRAE,the varied sensations of that seventeen days. All the gunners down this
1735,JOHN MCCRAE,way passed us all sorts of 'kudos' over it. Our guns--those behind
1736,JOHN MCCRAE,"us, from which we had to dodge occasional prematures--have a peculiar"
1737,JOHN MCCRAE,bang-sound added to the sharp crack of discharge. The French 75 has a
1738,JOHN MCCRAE,"sharp wood-block-chop sound, and the shell goes over with a peculiar"
1739,JOHN MCCRAE,"whine--not unlike a cat, but beginning with n--thus,--n-eouw. The big"
1740,JOHN MCCRAE,"fellows, 3000 yards or more behind, sounded exactly like our own, but"
1741,JOHN MCCRAE,the flash came three or four seconds before the sound. Of the German
1742,JOHN MCCRAE,shells--the field guns come with a great velocity--no warning--just
1743,JOHN MCCRAE,"whizz-bang; white smoke, nearly always air bursts. The next size,"
1744,JOHN MCCRAE,"probably 5 inch howitzers, have a perceptible time of approach, an"
1745,JOHN MCCRAE,"increasing whine, and a great burst on the percussion--dirt in all"
1746,JOHN MCCRAE,"directions. And even if a shell hit on the front of the canal bank, and"
1747,JOHN MCCRAE,"one were on the back of the bank, five, eight, or ten seconds later"
1748,JOHN MCCRAE,"one would hear a belated WHIRR, and curved pieces of shell would"
1749,JOHN MCCRAE,light--probably parabolic curves or boomerangs. These shells have a
1750,JOHN MCCRAE,great back kick; from the field gun shrapnel we got nothing BEHIND the
1751,JOHN MCCRAE,"shell--all the pieces go forward. From the howitzers, the danger is"
1752,JOHN MCCRAE,almost as great behind as in front if they burst on percussion. Then the
1753,JOHN MCCRAE,"large shrapnel--air-burst--have a double explosion, as if a giant shook"
1754,JOHN MCCRAE,a wet sail for two flaps; first a dark green burst of smoke; then
1755,JOHN MCCRAE,"a lighter yellow burst goes out from the centre, forwards. I do not"
1756,JOHN MCCRAE,understand the why of it.
1757,JOHN MCCRAE,
1758,JOHN MCCRAE,Then the 10-inch shells: a deliberate whirring course--a deafening
1759,JOHN MCCRAE,"explosion--black smoke, and earth 70 or 80 feet in the air. These always"
1760,JOHN MCCRAE,burst on percussion. The constant noise of our own guns is really worse
1761,JOHN MCCRAE,"on the nerves than the shell; there is the deafening noise, and the"
1762,JOHN MCCRAE,constant whirr of shells going overhead. The earth shakes with every
1763,JOHN MCCRAE,nearby gun and every close shell. I think I may safely enclose a cross
1764,JOHN MCCRAE,section of our position. The left is the front: a slope down of 20 feet
1765,JOHN MCCRAE,"in 100 yards to the canal, a high row of trees on each bank, then a"
1766,JOHN MCCRAE,"short 40 yards slope up to the summit of the trench, where the brain of"
1767,JOHN MCCRAE,"the outfit was; then a telephone wired slope, and on the sharp slope,"
1768,JOHN MCCRAE,"the dugouts, including my own. The nondescript affair on the low slope"
1769,JOHN MCCRAE,"is the gun position, behind it the men's shelter pits. Behind my dugout"
1770,JOHN MCCRAE,"was a rapid small stream, on its far bank a row of pollard willows, then"
1771,JOHN MCCRAE,"30 yards of field, then a road with two parallel rows of high trees."
1772,JOHN MCCRAE,"Behind this again, several hundred yards of fields to cross before the"
1773,JOHN MCCRAE,main gun positions are reached.
1774,JOHN MCCRAE,
1775,JOHN MCCRAE,"More often fire came from three quarters left, and because our ridge"
1776,JOHN MCCRAE,died away there was a low spot over which they could come pretty
1777,JOHN MCCRAE,dangerously. The road thirty yards behind us was a nightmare to me.
1778,JOHN MCCRAE,"I saw all the tragedies of war enacted there. A wagon, or a bunch of"
1779,JOHN MCCRAE,"horses, or a stray man, or a couple of men, would get there just in time"
1780,JOHN MCCRAE,"for a shell. One would see the absolute knock-out, and the obviously"
1781,JOHN MCCRAE,"lightly wounded crawling off on hands and knees; or worse yet, at night,"
1782,JOHN MCCRAE,"one would hear the tragedy--""that horse scream""--or the man's moan. All"
1783,JOHN MCCRAE,"our own wagons had to come there (one every half hour in smart action),"
1784,JOHN MCCRAE,"be emptied, and the ammunition carried over by hand. Do you wonder that"
1785,JOHN MCCRAE,"the road got on our nerves? On this road, too, was the house where we"
1786,JOHN MCCRAE,"took our meals. It was hit several times, windows all blown in by nearby"
1787,JOHN MCCRAE,"shells, but one end remained for us."
1788,JOHN MCCRAE,
1789,JOHN MCCRAE,Seventeen days of Hades! At the end of the first day if anyone had told
1790,JOHN MCCRAE,"us we had to spend seventeen days there, we would have folded our hands"
1791,JOHN MCCRAE,and said it could not be done. On the fifteenth day we got orders to
1792,JOHN MCCRAE,"go out, but that was countermanded in two hours. To the last we could"
1793,JOHN MCCRAE,scarcely believe we were actually to get out. The real audacity of the
1794,JOHN MCCRAE,position was its safety; the Germans knew to a foot where we were. I
1795,JOHN MCCRAE,"think I told you of some of the ""you must stick it out"" messages we got"
1796,JOHN MCCRAE,"from our [French] General,--they put it up to us. It is a wonder to me"
1797,JOHN MCCRAE,"that we slept when, and how, we did. If we had not slept and eaten as"
1798,JOHN MCCRAE,well as possible we could not have lasted. And while we were doing
1799,JOHN MCCRAE,"this, the London office of a Canadian newspaper cabled home ""Canadian"
1800,JOHN MCCRAE,"Artillery in reserve."" Such is fame!"
1801,JOHN MCCRAE,
1802,JOHN MCCRAE,
1803,JOHN MCCRAE,
1804,JOHN MCCRAE,"Thursday, May 27th, 1915."
1805,JOHN MCCRAE,
1806,JOHN MCCRAE,"Day cloudy and chilly. We wore our greatcoats most of the afternoon,"
1807,JOHN MCCRAE,and looked for bits of sunlight to get warm. About two o'clock the heavy
1808,JOHN MCCRAE,"guns gave us a regular ""black-smithing"". Every time we fired we drew a"
1809,JOHN MCCRAE,"perfect hornet's nest about our heads. While attending to a casualty,"
1810,JOHN MCCRAE,"a shell broke through both sides of the trench, front and back, about"
1811,JOHN MCCRAE,"twelve feet away. The zigzag of the trench was between it and us, and we"
1812,JOHN MCCRAE,"escaped. From my bunk the moon looks down at me, and the wind whistles"
1813,JOHN MCCRAE,along the trench like a corridor. As the trenches run in all directions
1814,JOHN MCCRAE,"they catch the wind however it blows, so one is always sure of a good"
1815,JOHN MCCRAE,"draught. We have not had our clothes off since last Saturday, and there"
1816,JOHN MCCRAE,is no near prospect of getting them off.
1817,JOHN MCCRAE,
1818,JOHN MCCRAE,
1819,JOHN MCCRAE,
1820,JOHN MCCRAE,"Friday, May 28th, 1915."
1821,JOHN MCCRAE,
1822,JOHN MCCRAE,"Warmer this morning and sunny, a quiet morning, as far as we were"
1823,JOHN MCCRAE,"concerned. One battery fired twenty rounds and the rest ""sat tight""."
1824,JOHN MCCRAE,"Newspapers which arrive show that up to May 7th, the Canadian public has"
1825,JOHN MCCRAE,made no guess at the extent of the battle of Ypres. The Canadian
1826,JOHN MCCRAE,papers seem to have lost interest in it after the first four days; this
1827,JOHN MCCRAE,"regardless of the fact that the artillery, numerically a quarter of"
1828,JOHN MCCRAE,"the division, was in all the time. One correspondent writes from the"
1829,JOHN MCCRAE,"Canadian rest camp, and never mentions Ypres. Others say they hear heavy"
1830,JOHN MCCRAE,bombarding which appears to come from Armentieres.
1831,JOHN MCCRAE,
1832,JOHN MCCRAE,
1833,JOHN MCCRAE,
1834,JOHN MCCRAE,
1835,JOHN MCCRAE,A few strokes will complete the picture:
1836,JOHN MCCRAE,
1837,JOHN MCCRAE,
1838,JOHN MCCRAE,
1839,JOHN MCCRAE,"Wednesday, April 29th*, 1915."
1840,JOHN MCCRAE,
1841,JOHN MCCRAE,"This morning is the sixth day of this fight; it has been constant,"
1842,JOHN MCCRAE,except that we got good chance to sleep for the last two nights. Our
1843,JOHN MCCRAE,men have fought beyond praise. Canadian soldiers have set a standard for
1844,JOHN MCCRAE,themselves which will keep posterity busy to surpass. And the War Office
1845,JOHN MCCRAE,published that the 4.1 guns captured were Canadian. They were not: the
1846,JOHN MCCRAE,division has not lost a gun so far by capture. We will make a good job
1847,JOHN MCCRAE,of it--if we can.
1848,JOHN MCCRAE,
1849,JOHN MCCRAE,
1850,JOHN MCCRAE,"* [sic]  This should read April 28th.--A. L., 1995."
1851,JOHN MCCRAE,

1853,JOHN MCCRAE,
1854,JOHN MCCRAE,"May 1st, 1915."
1855,JOHN MCCRAE,
1856,JOHN MCCRAE,"This is the ninth day that we have stuck to the ridge, and the batteries"
1857,JOHN MCCRAE,have fought with a steadiness which is beyond all praise. If I could say
1858,JOHN MCCRAE,"what our casualties in men, guns, and horses were, you would see at a"
1859,JOHN MCCRAE,glance it has been a hot corner; but we have given better than we
1860,JOHN MCCRAE,"got, for the German casualties from this front have been largely from"
1861,JOHN MCCRAE,"artillery, except for the French attack of yesterday and the day before,"
1862,JOHN MCCRAE,"when they advanced appreciably on our left. The front, however, just"
1863,JOHN MCCRAE,"here remains where it was, and the artillery fire is very heavy--I think"
1864,JOHN MCCRAE,"as heavy here as on any part of the line, with the exception of certain"
1865,JOHN MCCRAE,cross-roads which are the particular object of fire. The first four days
1866,JOHN MCCRAE,"the anxiety was wearing, for we did not know at what minute the German"
1867,JOHN MCCRAE,army corps would come for us. We lie out in support of the French troops
1868,JOHN MCCRAE,"entirely, and are working with them. Since that time evidently great"
1869,JOHN MCCRAE,"reinforcements have come in, and now we have a most formidable force of"
1870,JOHN MCCRAE,artillery to turn on them.
1871,JOHN MCCRAE,
1872,JOHN MCCRAE,Fortunately the weather has been good; the days are hot and summer-like.
1873,JOHN MCCRAE,Yesterday in the press of bad smells I got a whiff of a hedgerow in
1874,JOHN MCCRAE,bloom. The birds perch on the trees over our heads and twitter away as
1875,JOHN MCCRAE,if there was nothing to worry about. Bonfire is still well. I do hope he
1876,JOHN MCCRAE,gets through all right.

1880,JOHN MCCRAE,"Flanders, March 30th, 1915."
1881,JOHN MCCRAE,
1882,JOHN MCCRAE,The Brigade is actually in twelve different places. The ammunition
1883,JOHN MCCRAE,"column and the horse and wagon lines are back, and my corporal visits"
1884,JOHN MCCRAE,them every day. I attend the gun lines; any casualty is reported by
1885,JOHN MCCRAE,"telephone, and I go to it. The wounded and sick stay where they are till"
1886,JOHN MCCRAE,"dark, when the field ambulances go over certain grounds and collect. A"
1887,JOHN MCCRAE,"good deal of suffering is entailed by the delay till night, but it"
1888,JOHN MCCRAE,is useless for vehicles to go on the roads within 1500 yards of the
1889,JOHN MCCRAE,trenches. They are willing enough to go. Most of the trench injuries are
1890,JOHN MCCRAE,"of the head, and therefore there is a high proportion of killed in"
1891,JOHN MCCRAE,the daily warfare as opposed to an attack. Our Canadian plots fill up
1892,JOHN MCCRAE,rapidly.
1893,JOHN MCCRAE,
1894,JOHN MCCRAE,
1895,JOHN MCCRAE,
1896,JOHN MCCRAE,
1897,JOHN MCCRAE,And here is one last note to his mother:
1898,JOHN MCCRAE,
1899,JOHN MCCRAE,
1900,JOHN MCCRAE,On the eve of the battle of Ypres I was indebted to you for a letter
1901,JOHN MCCRAE,"which said ""take good care of my son Jack, but I would not have you"
1902,JOHN MCCRAE,"unmindful that, sometimes, when we save we lose."" I have that last happy"
1903,JOHN MCCRAE,phrase to thank. Often when I had to go out over the areas that were
1904,JOHN MCCRAE,"being shelled, it came into my mind. I would shoulder the box, and ""go"
1905,JOHN MCCRAE,"to it""."
1906,JOHN MCCRAE,
1907,JOHN MCCRAE,
1908,JOHN MCCRAE,
1909,JOHN MCCRAE,
1910,JOHN MCCRAE,At this time the Canadian division was moving south to take its share in
1911,JOHN MCCRAE,the events that happened in the La Bassee sector. Here is the record:
1912,JOHN MCCRAE,
1913,JOHN MCCRAE,
1914,JOHN MCCRAE,
1915,JOHN MCCRAE,"Tuesday, June 1st, 1915."
1916,JOHN MCCRAE,
1917,JOHN MCCRAE,"1-1/2 miles northeast of Festubert, near La Bassee."
1918,JOHN MCCRAE,
1919,JOHN MCCRAE,Last night a 15 pr. and a 4-inch howitzer fired at intervals of five
1920,JOHN MCCRAE,minutes from 8 till 4; most of them within 500 or 600 yards--a very
1921,JOHN MCCRAE,tiresome procedure; much of it is on registered roads. In the morning I
1922,JOHN MCCRAE,"walked out to Le Touret to the wagon lines, got Bonfire, and rode to"
1923,JOHN MCCRAE,"the headquarters at Vendin-lez-Bethune, a little village a mile"
1924,JOHN MCCRAE,past Bethune. Left the horse at the lines and walked back again. An
1925,JOHN MCCRAE,unfortunate shell in the 1st killed a sergeant and wounded two men;
1926,JOHN MCCRAE,thanks to the strong emplacements the rest of the crew escaped. In the
1927,JOHN MCCRAE,evening went around the batteries and said good-bye. We stood by while
1928,JOHN MCCRAE,they laid away the sergeant who was killed. Kind hands have made two
1929,JOHN MCCRAE,"pathetic little wreaths of roses; the grave under an apple-tree, and"
1930,JOHN MCCRAE,the moon rising over the horizon; a siege-lamp held for the book. Of
1931,JOHN MCCRAE,"the last 41 days the guns have been in action 33. Captain Lockhart, late"
1932,JOHN MCCRAE,"with Fort Garry Horse, arrived to relieve me. I handed over, came up to"
1933,JOHN MCCRAE,"the horse lines, and slept in a covered wagon in a courtyard. We were"
1934,JOHN MCCRAE,all sorry to part--the four of us have been very intimate and had agreed
1935,JOHN MCCRAE,perfectly--and friendships under these circumstances are apt to be the
1936,JOHN MCCRAE,"real thing. I am sorry to leave them in such a hot corner, but cannot"
1937,JOHN MCCRAE,"choose and must obey orders. It is a great relief from strain, I must"
1938,JOHN MCCRAE,"admit, to be out, but I could wish that they all were."

1940,JOHN MCCRAE,

1942,JOHN MCCRAE,
1943,JOHN MCCRAE,"This phase of the war lasted two months precisely,"
1944,JOHN MCCRAE,
1945,JOHN MCCRAE,and to John McCrae it must have seemed a lifetime since he went into
1946,JOHN MCCRAE,this memorable action. The events preceding the second battle of Ypres
1947,JOHN MCCRAE,"received scant mention in his letters; but one remains, which brings"
1948,JOHN MCCRAE,into relief one of the many moves of that tumultuous time.
1949,JOHN MCCRAE,
1950,JOHN MCCRAE,
1951,JOHN MCCRAE,
1952,JOHN MCCRAE,"April 1st, 1915."
1953,JOHN MCCRAE,
1954,JOHN MCCRAE,"We moved out in the late afternoon, getting on the road a little after"
1955,JOHN MCCRAE,"dark. Such a move is not unattended by danger, for to bring horses and"
1956,JOHN MCCRAE,limbers down the roads in the shell zone in daylight renders them liable
1957,JOHN MCCRAE,"to observation, aerial or otherwise. More than that, the roads are now"
1958,JOHN MCCRAE,"beginning to be dusty, and at all times there is the noise which carries"
1959,JOHN MCCRAE,"far. The roads are nearly all registered in their battery books, so if"
1960,JOHN MCCRAE,"they suspect a move, it is the natural thing to loose off a few rounds."
1961,JOHN MCCRAE,"However, our anxiety was not borne out, and we got out of the danger"
1962,JOHN MCCRAE,"zone by 8.30--a not too long march in the dark, and then for the last"
1963,JOHN MCCRAE,of the march a glorious full moon. The houses everywhere are as dark as
1964,JOHN MCCRAE,"possible, and on the roads noises but no lights. One goes on by the long"
1965,JOHN MCCRAE,"rows of trees that are so numerous in this country, on cobblestones and"
1966,JOHN MCCRAE,"country roads, watching one's horses' ears wagging, and seeing not much"
1967,JOHN MCCRAE,"else. Our maps are well studied before we start, and this time we"
1968,JOHN MCCRAE,are not far out of familiar territory. We got to our new billet about
1969,JOHN MCCRAE,10--quite a good farmhouse; and almost at once one feels the relief of
1970,JOHN MCCRAE,the strain of being in the shell zone. I cannot say I had noticed it
1971,JOHN MCCRAE,when there; but one is distinctly relieved when out of it.
1972,JOHN MCCRAE,
1973,JOHN MCCRAE,
1974,JOHN MCCRAE,
1975,JOHN MCCRAE,"Such, then, was the life in Flanders fields in which the verse was born."
1976,JOHN MCCRAE,This is no mere surmise. There is a letter from Major-General E. W. B.
1977,JOHN MCCRAE,"Morrison, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., who commanded the Brigade at the time,"
1978,JOHN MCCRAE,"which is quite explicit. ""This poem,"" General Morrison writes, ""was"
1979,JOHN MCCRAE,literally born of fire and blood during the hottest phase of the second
1980,JOHN MCCRAE,battle of Ypres. My headquarters were in a trench on the top of the bank
1981,JOHN MCCRAE,"of the Ypres Canal, and John had his dressing station in a hole dug in"
1982,JOHN MCCRAE,the foot of the bank. During periods in the battle men who were shot
1983,JOHN MCCRAE,actually rolled down the bank into his dressing station. Along from us
1984,JOHN MCCRAE,"a few hundred yards was the headquarters of a regiment, and many times"
1985,JOHN MCCRAE,"during the sixteen days of battle, he and I watched them burying their"
1986,JOHN MCCRAE,"dead whenever there was a lull. Thus the crosses, row on row, grew"
1987,JOHN MCCRAE,"into a good-sized cemetery. Just as he describes, we often heard in the"
1988,JOHN MCCRAE,"mornings the larks singing high in the air, between the crash of the"
1989,JOHN MCCRAE,shell and the reports of the guns in the battery just beside us. I have
1990,JOHN MCCRAE,a letter from him in which he mentions having written the poem to pass
1991,JOHN MCCRAE,"away the time between the arrival of batches of wounded, and partly as"
1992,JOHN MCCRAE,an experiment with several varieties of poetic metre. I have a sketch of
1993,JOHN MCCRAE,"the scene, taken at the time, including his dressing station; and during"
1994,JOHN MCCRAE,"our operations at Passchendaele last November, I found time to make a"
1995,JOHN MCCRAE,"sketch of the scene of the crosses, row on row, from which he derived"
1996,JOHN MCCRAE,"his inspiration."""
1997,JOHN MCCRAE,
1998,JOHN MCCRAE,"The last letter from the Front is dated June 1st, 1915. Upon that day he"
1999,JOHN MCCRAE,"was posted to No. 3 General Hospital at Boulogne, and placed in charge"
2000,JOHN MCCRAE,"of medicine with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel as of date 17th April,"
2001,JOHN MCCRAE,"1915. Here he remained until the day of his death on January 28th, 1918."

2006,JOHN MCCRAE,III. The Brand of War
2007,JOHN MCCRAE,
2008,JOHN MCCRAE,
2009,JOHN MCCRAE,There are men who pass through such scenes unmoved. If they have
2010,JOHN MCCRAE,"eyes, they do not see; and ears, they do not hear. But John McCrae was"
2011,JOHN MCCRAE,"profoundly moved, and bore in his body until the end the signs of his"
2012,JOHN MCCRAE,experience. Before taking up his new duties he made a visit to the
2013,JOHN MCCRAE,hospitals in Paris to see if there was any new thing that might be
2014,JOHN MCCRAE,learned. A Nursing Sister in the American Ambulance at Neuilly-sur-Seine
2015,JOHN MCCRAE,met him in the wards. Although she had known him for fifteen years she
2016,JOHN MCCRAE,"did not recognize him,--he appeared to her so old, so worn, his face"
2017,JOHN MCCRAE,"lined and ashen grey in colour, his expression dull, his action slow and"
2018,JOHN MCCRAE,heavy.
2019,JOHN MCCRAE,
2020,JOHN MCCRAE,To those who have never seen John McCrae since he left Canada this
2021,JOHN MCCRAE,"change in his appearance will seem incredible. He was of the Eckfords,"
2022,JOHN MCCRAE,"and the Eckford men were ""bonnie men"", men with rosy cheeks. It was"
2023,JOHN MCCRAE,"a year before I met him again, and he had not yet recovered from the"
2024,JOHN MCCRAE,strain. Although he was upwards of forty years of age when he left
2025,JOHN MCCRAE,Canada he had always retained an appearance of extreme youthfulness. He
2026,JOHN MCCRAE,"frequented the company of men much younger than himself, and their youth"
2027,JOHN MCCRAE,"was imputed to him. His frame was tall and well knit, and he showed"
2028,JOHN MCCRAE,alertness in every move. He would arise from the chair with every muscle
2029,JOHN MCCRAE,"in action, and walk forth as if he were about to dance."
2030,JOHN MCCRAE,
2031,JOHN MCCRAE,The first time I saw him he was doing an autopsy at the Montreal General
2032,JOHN MCCRAE,Hospital upon the body of a child who had died under my care. This must
2033,JOHN MCCRAE,"have been in the year 1900, and the impression of boyishness remained"
2034,JOHN MCCRAE,until I met him in France sixteen years later. His manner of dress
2035,JOHN MCCRAE,did much to produce this illusion. When he was a student in London he
2036,JOHN MCCRAE,employed a tailor in Queen Victoria Street to make his clothes; but with
2037,JOHN MCCRAE,advancing years he neglected to have new measurements taken or to alter
2038,JOHN MCCRAE,the pattern of his cloth. To obtain a new suit was merely to write a
2039,JOHN MCCRAE,"letter, and he was always economical of time. In those days jackets were"
2040,JOHN MCCRAE,"cut short, and he adhered to the fashion with persistent care."
2041,JOHN MCCRAE,
2042,JOHN MCCRAE,This appearance of youth at times caused chagrin to those patients who
2043,JOHN MCCRAE,"had heard of his fame as a physician, and called upon him for the"
2044,JOHN MCCRAE,"first time. In the Royal Victoria Hospital, after he had been appointed"
2045,JOHN MCCRAE,"physician, he entered the wards and asked a nurse to fetch a screen so"
2046,JOHN MCCRAE,that he might examine a patient in privacy.
2047,JOHN MCCRAE,
2048,JOHN MCCRAE,"""Students are not allowed to use screens,"" the young woman warned him"
2049,JOHN MCCRAE,with some asperity in her voice.
2050,JOHN MCCRAE,
2051,JOHN MCCRAE,If I were asked to state briefly the impression which remains with me
2052,JOHN MCCRAE,"most firmly, I should say it was one of continuous laughter. That is not"
2053,JOHN MCCRAE,"true, of course, for in repose his face was heavy, his countenance more"
2054,JOHN MCCRAE,"than ruddy; it was even of a ""choleric"" cast, and at times almost livid,"
2055,JOHN MCCRAE,especially when he was recovering from one of those attacks of asthma
2056,JOHN MCCRAE,"from which he habitually suffered. But his smile was his own, and it was"
2057,JOHN MCCRAE,"ineffable. It filled the eyes, and illumined the face. It was the smile"
2058,JOHN MCCRAE,"of sheer fun, of pure gaiety, of sincere playfulness, innocent of irony;"
2059,JOHN MCCRAE,with a tinge of sarcasm--never. When he allowed himself to speak of
2060,JOHN MCCRAE,"meanness in the profession, of dishonesty in men, of evil in the world,"
2061,JOHN MCCRAE,his face became formidable. The glow of his countenance deepened; his
2062,JOHN MCCRAE,"words were bitter, and the tones harsh. But the indignation would"
2063,JOHN MCCRAE,not last. The smile would come back. The effect was spoiled. Everyone
2064,JOHN MCCRAE,laughed with him.
2065,JOHN MCCRAE,
2066,JOHN MCCRAE,After his experience at the front the old gaiety never returned. There
2067,JOHN MCCRAE,were moments of irascibility and moods of irritation. The desire for
2068,JOHN MCCRAE,"solitude grew upon him, and with Bonfire and Bonneau he would go apart"
2069,JOHN MCCRAE,for long afternoons far afield by the roads and lanes about Boulogne.
2070,JOHN MCCRAE,"The truth is: he felt that he and all had failed, and that the torch"
2071,JOHN MCCRAE,"was thrown from failing hands. We have heard much of the suffering, the"
2072,JOHN MCCRAE,"misery, the cold, the wet, the gloom of those first three winters; but"
2073,JOHN MCCRAE,no tongue has yet uttered the inner misery of heart that was bred of
2074,JOHN MCCRAE,those three years of failure to break the enemy's force.
2075,JOHN MCCRAE,
2076,JOHN MCCRAE,"He was not alone in this shadow of deep darkness. Givenchy, Festubert,"
2077,JOHN MCCRAE,"Neuve-Chapelle, Ypres, Hooge, the Somme--to mention alone the battles in"
2078,JOHN MCCRAE,which up to that time the Canadian Corps had been engaged--all ended in
2079,JOHN MCCRAE,failure; and to a sensitive and foreboding mind there were sounds and
2080,JOHN MCCRAE,signs that it would be given to this generation to hear the pillars and
2081,JOHN MCCRAE,fabric of Empire come crashing into the abysm of chaos. He was not at
2082,JOHN MCCRAE,"the Somme in that October of 1916, but those who returned up north"
2083,JOHN MCCRAE,with the remnants of their division from that place of slaughter will
2084,JOHN MCCRAE,"remember that, having done all men could do, they felt like deserters"
2085,JOHN MCCRAE,because they had not left their poor bodies dead upon the field along
2086,JOHN MCCRAE,"with friends of a lifetime, comrades of a campaign. This is no mere"
2087,JOHN MCCRAE,matter of surmise. The last day I spent with him we talked of those
2088,JOHN MCCRAE,"things in his tent, and I testify that it is true."

2093,JOHN MCCRAE,IV. Going to the Wars
2094,JOHN MCCRAE,
2095,JOHN MCCRAE,
2096,JOHN MCCRAE,"John McCrae went to the war without illusions. At first, like many"
2097,JOHN MCCRAE,"others of his age, he did not ""think of enlisting"", although ""his"
2098,JOHN MCCRAE,"services are at the disposal of the Country if it needs them."""
2099,JOHN MCCRAE,
2100,JOHN MCCRAE,"In July, 1914, he was at work upon the second edition of the 'Text-Book"
2101,JOHN MCCRAE,"of Pathology' by Adami and McCrae, published by Messrs. Lea and Febiger,"
2102,JOHN MCCRAE,and he had gone to Philadelphia to read the proofs. He took them to
2103,JOHN MCCRAE,"Atlantic City where he could ""sit out on the sand, and get sunshine and"
2104,JOHN MCCRAE,"oxygen, and work all at once."""
2105,JOHN MCCRAE,
2106,JOHN MCCRAE,"It was a laborious task, passing eighty to a hundred pages of highly"
2107,JOHN MCCRAE,"technical print each day. Then there was the index, between six and"
2108,JOHN MCCRAE,"seven thousand items. ""I have,"" so he writes, ""to change every item in"
2109,JOHN MCCRAE,"the old index and add others. I have a pile of pages, 826 in all. I"
2110,JOHN MCCRAE,"look at the index, find the old page among the 826, and then change the"
2111,JOHN MCCRAE,"number. This about 7000 times, so you may guess the drudgery."" On July"
2112,JOHN MCCRAE,"15th, the work was finished, registered, and entrusted to the mail with"
2113,JOHN MCCRAE,"a special delivery stamp. The next day he wrote the preface, ""which"
2114,JOHN MCCRAE,"really finished the job."" In very truth his scientific work was done."
2115,JOHN MCCRAE,
2116,JOHN MCCRAE,It was now midsummer. The weather was hot. He returned to Montreal.
2117,JOHN MCCRAE,"Practice was dull. He was considering a voyage to Havre and ""a little"
2118,JOHN MCCRAE,"trip with Dr. Adami"" when he arrived. On July 29th, he left Canada ""for"
2119,JOHN MCCRAE,"better or worse. With the world so disturbed,"" he records, ""I would"
2120,JOHN MCCRAE,"gladly have stayed more in touch with events, but I dare say one is just"
2121,JOHN MCCRAE,"as happy away from the hundred conflicting reports."" The ship was the"
2122,JOHN MCCRAE,"'Scotian' of the Allan Line, and he ""shared a comfortable cabin with a"
2123,JOHN MCCRAE,"professor of Greek,"" who was at the University in his own time."
2124,JOHN MCCRAE,
2125,JOHN MCCRAE,"For one inland born, he had a keen curiosity about ships and the sea."
2126,JOHN MCCRAE,There is a letter written when he was thirteen years of age in which
2127,JOHN MCCRAE,he gives an account of a visit to a naval exhibition in London. He
2128,JOHN MCCRAE,"describes the models which he saw, and gives an elaborate table of"
2129,JOHN MCCRAE,"names, dimensions, and tonnage. He could identify the house flags and"
2130,JOHN MCCRAE,funnels of all the principal liners; he could follow a ship through all
2131,JOHN MCCRAE,her vicissitudes and change of ownership. When he found himself in a
2132,JOHN MCCRAE,seaport town his first business was to visit the water front and take
2133,JOHN MCCRAE,knowledge of the vessels that lay in the stream or by the docks. One
2134,JOHN MCCRAE,voyage he made to England was in a cargo ship. With his passion for
2135,JOHN MCCRAE,"work he took on the duties of surgeon, and amazed the skipper with a"
2136,JOHN MCCRAE,revelation of the new technique in operations which he himself had been
2137,JOHN MCCRAE,accustomed to perform by the light of experience alone.
2138,JOHN MCCRAE,
2139,JOHN MCCRAE,"On the present and more luxurious voyage, he remarks that the decks were"
2140,JOHN MCCRAE,"roomy, the ship seven years old, and capable of fifteen knots an hour,"
2141,JOHN MCCRAE,"the passengers pleasant, and including a large number of French. All now"
2142,JOHN MCCRAE,know only too well the nature of the business which sent those ardent
2143,JOHN MCCRAE,spirits flocking home to their native land.
2144,JOHN MCCRAE,
2145,JOHN MCCRAE,Forty-eight hours were lost in fog. The weather was too thick for making
2146,JOHN MCCRAE,"the Straits, and the 'Scotian' proceeded by Cape Race on her way to"
2147,JOHN MCCRAE,Havre. Under date of August 5-6 the first reference to the war appears:
2148,JOHN MCCRAE,"""All is excitement; the ship runs without lights. Surely the German"
2149,JOHN MCCRAE,"kaiser has his head in the noose at last: it will be a terrible war, and"
2150,JOHN MCCRAE,the finish of one or the other. I am afraid my holiday trip is knocked
2151,JOHN MCCRAE,"galley west; but we shall see."" The voyage continues. A ""hundred miles"
2152,JOHN MCCRAE,"from Moville we turned back, and headed South for Queenstown; thence to"
2153,JOHN MCCRAE,the Channel; put in at Portland; a squadron of battleships; arrived here
2154,JOHN MCCRAE,"this morning."""
2155,JOHN MCCRAE,
2156,JOHN MCCRAE,The problem presented itself to him as to many another. The decision was
2157,JOHN MCCRAE,made. To go back to America was to go back from the war. Here are the
2158,JOHN MCCRAE,"words: ""It seems quite impossible to return, and I do not think I"
2159,JOHN MCCRAE,should try. I would not feel quite comfortable over it. I am cabling to
2160,JOHN MCCRAE,"Morrison at Ottawa, that I am available either as combatant or medical"
2161,JOHN MCCRAE,"if they need me. I do not go to it very light-heartedly, but I think it"
2162,JOHN MCCRAE,"is up to me."""
2163,JOHN MCCRAE,
2164,JOHN MCCRAE,"It was not so easy in those days to get to the war, as he and many"
2165,JOHN MCCRAE,others were soon to discover. There was in Canada at the time a small
2166,JOHN MCCRAE,"permanent force of 3000 men, a military college, a Headquarters staff,"
2167,JOHN MCCRAE,and divisional staff for the various districts into which the country
2168,JOHN MCCRAE,was divided. In addition there was a body of militia with a strength of
2169,JOHN MCCRAE,"about 60,000 officers and other ranks. Annual camps were formed at which"
2170,JOHN MCCRAE,"all arms of the service were represented, and the whole was a very good"
2171,JOHN MCCRAE,imitation of service conditions. Complete plans for mobilization were
2172,JOHN MCCRAE,"in existence, by which a certain quota, according to the establishment"
2173,JOHN MCCRAE,"required, could be detailed from each district. But upon the outbreak"
2174,JOHN MCCRAE,of war the operations were taken in hand by a Minister of Militia who
2175,JOHN MCCRAE,assumed in his own person all those duties usually assigned to the
2176,JOHN MCCRAE,staff. He called to his assistance certain business and political
2177,JOHN MCCRAE,"associates, with the result that volunteers who followed military"
2178,JOHN MCCRAE,methods did not get very far.
2179,JOHN MCCRAE,
2180,JOHN MCCRAE,Accordingly we find it written in John McCrae's diary from London:
2181,JOHN MCCRAE,"""Nothing doing here. I have yet no word from the Department at Ottawa,"
2182,JOHN MCCRAE,but I try to be philosophical until I hear from Morrison. If they want
2183,JOHN MCCRAE,"me for the Canadian forces, I could use my old Sam Browne belt, sword,"
2184,JOHN MCCRAE,and saddle if it is yet extant. At times I wish I could go home with a
2185,JOHN MCCRAE,"clear conscience."""
2186,JOHN MCCRAE,
2187,JOHN MCCRAE,"He sailed for Canada in the 'Calgarian' on August 28th, having received"
2188,JOHN MCCRAE,"a cablegram from Colonel Morrison, that he had been provisionally"
2189,JOHN MCCRAE,appointed surgeon to the 1st Brigade Artillery. The night he arrived in
2190,JOHN MCCRAE,"Montreal I dined with him at the University Club, and he was aglow with"
2191,JOHN MCCRAE,enthusiasm over this new adventure. He remained in Montreal for a few
2192,JOHN MCCRAE,"days, and on September 9th, joined the unit to which he was attached as"
2193,JOHN MCCRAE,medical officer. Before leaving Montreal he wrote to his sister Geills:
2194,JOHN MCCRAE,
2195,JOHN MCCRAE,"""Out on the awful old trail again! And with very mixed feelings, but"
2196,JOHN MCCRAE,some determination. I am off to Val-cartier to-night. I was really
2197,JOHN MCCRAE,"afraid to go home, for I feared it would only be harrowing for Mater,"
2198,JOHN MCCRAE,and I think she agrees. We can hope for happier times. Everyone most
2199,JOHN MCCRAE,kind and helpful: my going does not seem to surprise anyone. I know you
2200,JOHN MCCRAE,"will understand it is hard to go home, and perhaps easier for us all"
2201,JOHN MCCRAE,"that I do not. I am in good hope of coming back soon and safely: that, I"
2202,JOHN MCCRAE,"am glad to say, is in other and better hands than ours."""
2203,JOHN MCCRAE,

2208,JOHN MCCRAE,
2209,JOHN MCCRAE,
2210,JOHN MCCRAE,"In the Autumn of 1914, after John McCrae had gone over-seas, I was in a"
2211,JOHN MCCRAE,"warehouse in Montreal, in which one might find an old piece of mahogany"
2212,JOHN MCCRAE,"wood. His boxes were there in storage, with his name plainly printed"
2213,JOHN MCCRAE,"upon them. The storeman, observing my interest, remarked: ""This Doctor"
2214,JOHN MCCRAE,"McCrae cannot be doing much business; he is always going to the wars."""
2215,JOHN MCCRAE,The remark was profoundly significant of the state of mind upon the
2216,JOHN MCCRAE,subject of war which prevailed at the time in Canada in more intelligent
2217,JOHN MCCRAE,persons. To this storeman war merely meant that the less usefully
2218,JOHN MCCRAE,employed members of the community sent their boxes to him for
2219,JOHN MCCRAE,safe-keeping until their return. War was a great holiday from work; and
2220,JOHN MCCRAE,he had a vague remembrance that some fifteen years before this customer
2221,JOHN MCCRAE,had required of him a similar service when the South African war broke
2222,JOHN MCCRAE,out.
2223,JOHN MCCRAE,
2224,JOHN MCCRAE,"Either 'in esse' or 'in posse' John McCrae had ""always been going to the"
2225,JOHN MCCRAE,"wars."" At fourteen years of age he joined the Guelph Highland Cadets,"
2226,JOHN MCCRAE,and rose to the rank of 1st Lieutenant. As his size and strength
2227,JOHN MCCRAE,increased he reverted to the ranks and transferred to the Artillery. In
2228,JOHN MCCRAE,"due time he rose from gunner to major. The formal date of his ""Gazette"""
2229,JOHN MCCRAE,is 17-3-02 as they write it in the army; but he earned his rank in South
2230,JOHN MCCRAE,Africa.
2231,JOHN MCCRAE,
2232,JOHN MCCRAE,War was the burden of his thought; war and death the theme of his verse.
2233,JOHN MCCRAE,"At the age of thirteen we find him at a gallery in Nottingham, writing"
2234,JOHN MCCRAE,"this note: ""I saw the picture of the artillery going over the trenches"
2235,JOHN MCCRAE,at Tel-el-Kebir. It is a good picture; but there are four teams on the
2236,JOHN MCCRAE,"guns. Perhaps an extra one had to be put on."" If his nomenclature was"
2237,JOHN MCCRAE,"not correct, the observation of the young artillerist was exact. Such"
2238,JOHN MCCRAE,"excesses were not permitted in his father's battery in Guelph, Ontario."
2239,JOHN MCCRAE,"During this same visit his curiosity led him into the House of Lords,"
2240,JOHN MCCRAE,"and the sum of his written observation is, ""When someone is speaking no"
2241,JOHN MCCRAE,"one seems to listen at all."""
2242,JOHN MCCRAE,
2243,JOHN MCCRAE,His mother I never knew. Canada is a large place. With his father I
2244,JOHN MCCRAE,had four hours' talk from seven to eleven one June evening in London
2245,JOHN MCCRAE,in 1917. At the time I was on leave from France to give the Cavendish
2246,JOHN MCCRAE,"Lecture, a task which demanded some thought; and after two years in the"
2247,JOHN MCCRAE,army it was a curious sensation--watching one's mind at work again.
2248,JOHN MCCRAE,The day was Sunday. I had walked down to the river to watch the flowing
2249,JOHN MCCRAE,tide. To one brought up in a country of streams and a moving sea the
2250,JOHN MCCRAE,curse of Flanders is her stagnant waters. It is little wonder the exiles
2251,JOHN MCCRAE,from the Judaean hillsides wept beside the slimy River.
2252,JOHN MCCRAE,
2253,JOHN MCCRAE,"The Thames by evening in June, memories that reached from Tacitus to"
2254,JOHN MCCRAE,"Wordsworth, the embrasure that extends in front of the Egyptian obelisk"
2255,JOHN MCCRAE,"for a standing place, and some children ""swimming a dog"";--that was the"
2256,JOHN MCCRAE,scene and circumstance of my first meeting with his father. A man
2257,JOHN MCCRAE,of middle age was standing by. He wore the flashings of a
2258,JOHN MCCRAE,Lieutenant-Colonel and for badges the Artillery grenades. He seemed
2259,JOHN MCCRAE,"a friendly man; and under the influence of the moment, which he also"
2260,JOHN MCCRAE,"surely felt, I spoke to him."

2269,JOHN MCCRAE,"the sign, and looked at my patches."
2270,JOHN MCCRAE,
2271,JOHN MCCRAE,"""I have a son in France, myself,"" he said. ""His name is McCrae."""
2272,JOHN MCCRAE,
2273,JOHN MCCRAE,"""Not John McCrae?"""
2274,JOHN MCCRAE,
2275,JOHN MCCRAE,"""John McCrae is my son."""
2276,JOHN MCCRAE,
2277,JOHN MCCRAE,"The resemblance was instant, but this was an older man than at first"
2278,JOHN MCCRAE,"sight he seemed to be. I asked him to dinner at Morley's, my place of"
2279,JOHN MCCRAE,resort for a length of time beyond the memory of all but the oldest
2280,JOHN MCCRAE,"servants. He had already dined but he came and sat with me, and told me"
2281,JOHN MCCRAE,marvellous things.
2282,JOHN MCCRAE,
2283,JOHN MCCRAE,"David McCrae had raised, and trained, a field battery in Guelph, and"
2284,JOHN MCCRAE,"brought it overseas. He was at the time upwards of seventy years of age,"
2285,JOHN MCCRAE,"and was considered on account of years alone ""unfit"" to proceed to the"
2286,JOHN MCCRAE,front. For many years he had commanded a field battery in the Canadian
2287,JOHN MCCRAE,"militia, went on manoeuvres with his ""cannons"", and fired round shot."
2288,JOHN MCCRAE,When the time came for using shells he bored the fuse with a gimlet; and
2289,JOHN MCCRAE,"if the gimlet were lost in the grass, the gun was out of action until"
2290,JOHN MCCRAE,"the useful tool could be found. This ""cannon ball"" would travel over the"
2291,JOHN MCCRAE,"country according to the obstacles it encountered and, ""if it struck a"
2292,JOHN MCCRAE,"man, it might break his leg."""
2293,JOHN MCCRAE,
2294,JOHN MCCRAE,"In such a martial atmosphere the boy was brought up, and he was early"
2295,JOHN MCCRAE,nourished with the history of the Highland regiments. Also from his
2296,JOHN MCCRAE,"father he inherited, or had instilled into him, a love of the out of"
2297,JOHN MCCRAE,"doors, a knowledge of trees, and plants, a sympathy with birds and"
2298,JOHN MCCRAE,"beasts, domestic and wild. When the South African war broke out a"
2299,JOHN MCCRAE,"contingent was dispatched from Canada, but it was so small that few of"
2300,JOHN MCCRAE,those desiring to go could find a place. This explains the genesis of
2301,JOHN MCCRAE,the following letter:
2302,JOHN MCCRAE,
2303,JOHN MCCRAE,
2304,JOHN MCCRAE,I see by to-night's bulletin that there is to be no second contingent. I
2305,JOHN MCCRAE,"feel sick with disappointment, and do not believe that I have ever been"
2306,JOHN MCCRAE,"so disappointed in my life, for ever since this business began I am"
2307,JOHN MCCRAE,certain there have not been fifteen minutes of my waking hours that it
2308,JOHN MCCRAE,has not been in my mind. It has to come sooner or later. One campaign
2309,JOHN MCCRAE,"might cure me, but nothing else ever will, unless it should be old age."
2310,JOHN MCCRAE,"I regret bitterly that I did not enlist with the first, for I doubt if"
2311,JOHN MCCRAE,ever another chance will offer like it. This is not said in ignorance of
2312,JOHN MCCRAE,what the hardships would be.
2313,JOHN MCCRAE,
2314,JOHN MCCRAE,I am ashamed to say I am doing my work in a merely mechanical way. If
2315,JOHN MCCRAE,"they are taking surgeons on the other side, I have enough money to get"
2316,JOHN MCCRAE,"myself across. If I knew any one over there who could do anything, I"
2317,JOHN MCCRAE,would certainly set about it. If I can get an appointment in England
2318,JOHN MCCRAE,"by going, I will go. My position here I do not count as an old boot in"
2319,JOHN MCCRAE,comparison.
2320,JOHN MCCRAE,
2321,JOHN MCCRAE,
2322,JOHN MCCRAE,"In the end he accomplished the desire of his heart, and sailed on the"
2323,JOHN MCCRAE,'Laurentian'. Concerning the voyage one transcription will be enough:
2324,JOHN MCCRAE,
2325,JOHN MCCRAE,
2326,JOHN MCCRAE,On orderly duty. I have just been out taking the picket at 11.30 P.M. In
2327,JOHN MCCRAE,"the stables the long row of heads in the half-darkness, the creaking of"
2328,JOHN MCCRAE,"the ship, the shivering of the hull from the vibration of the engines,"
2329,JOHN MCCRAE,the sing of a sentry on the spar deck to some passer-by. Then to the
2330,JOHN MCCRAE,"forward deck: the sky half covered with scudding clouds, the stars"
2331,JOHN MCCRAE,"bright in the intervals, the wind whistling a regular blow that tries"
2332,JOHN MCCRAE,"one's ears, the constant swish as she settles down to a sea; and,"
2333,JOHN MCCRAE,"looking aft, the funnel with a wreath of smoke trailing away off into"
2334,JOHN MCCRAE,the darkness on the starboard quarter; the patch of white on the funnel
2335,JOHN MCCRAE,discernible dimly; the masts drawing maps across the sky as one looks
2336,JOHN MCCRAE,"up; the clank of shovels coming up through the ventilators,--if you have"
2337,JOHN MCCRAE,"ever been there, you know it all."
2338,JOHN MCCRAE,
2339,JOHN MCCRAE,There was a voluntary service at six; two ships' lanterns and the men
2340,JOHN MCCRAE,"all around, the background of sky and sea, and the strains of ""Nearer"
2341,JOHN MCCRAE,"my God to Thee"" rising up in splendid chorus. It was a very effective"
2342,JOHN MCCRAE,"scene, and it occurred to me that THIS was ""the rooibaatjees singing on"
2343,JOHN MCCRAE,"the road,"" as the song says."

2352,JOHN MCCRAE,"Green Point Camp, Capetown,"

2354,JOHN MCCRAE,"February 25th, 1900."
2355,JOHN MCCRAE,
2356,JOHN MCCRAE,You have no idea of the WORK. Section commanders live with their
2357,JOHN MCCRAE,"sections, which is the right way. It makes long hours. I never knew a"
2358,JOHN MCCRAE,softer bed than the ground is these nights. I really enjoy every minute
2359,JOHN MCCRAE,though there is anxiety. We have lost all our spare horses. We have only
2360,JOHN MCCRAE,enough to turn out the battery and no more.
2361,JOHN MCCRAE,
2362,JOHN MCCRAE,
2363,JOHN MCCRAE,"After a description of a number of the regiments camped near by them, he"
2364,JOHN MCCRAE,"speaks of the Indian troops, and then says:"
2365,JOHN MCCRAE,
2366,JOHN MCCRAE,
2367,JOHN MCCRAE,"We met the High Priest of it all, and I had a five minutes' chat with"
2368,JOHN MCCRAE,"him--Kipling I mean. He visited the camp. He looks like his pictures,"
2369,JOHN MCCRAE,and is very affable. He told me I spoke like a Winnipeger. He said we
2370,JOHN MCCRAE,"ought to ""fine the men for drinking unboiled water. Don't give them"
2371,JOHN MCCRAE,"C.B.; it is no good. Fine them, or drive common sense into them. All"
2372,JOHN MCCRAE,"Canadians have common sense."""
2373,JOHN MCCRAE,
2374,JOHN MCCRAE,
2375,JOHN MCCRAE,
2376,JOHN MCCRAE,
2377,JOHN MCCRAE,The next letter is from the Lines of Communication:
2378,JOHN MCCRAE,
2379,JOHN MCCRAE,
2380,JOHN MCCRAE,
2381,JOHN MCCRAE,"Van Wyks Vlei,"
2382,JOHN MCCRAE,
2383,JOHN MCCRAE,"March 22nd, 1900."
2384,JOHN MCCRAE,
2385,JOHN MCCRAE,Here I am with my first command. Each place we strike is a little more
2386,JOHN MCCRAE,"God-forsaken than the last, and this place wins up to date. We marched"
2387,JOHN MCCRAE,"last week from Victoria west to Carnovan, about 80 miles. We stayed"
2388,JOHN MCCRAE,"there over Sunday, and on Monday my section was detached with mounted"
2389,JOHN MCCRAE,"infantry, I being the only artillery officer. We marched 54 miles in"
2390,JOHN MCCRAE,"37 hours with stops; not very fast, but quite satisfactory. My horse is"
2391,JOHN MCCRAE,"doing well, although very thin. Night before last on the road we halted,"
2392,JOHN MCCRAE,and I dismounted for a minute. When we started I pulled on the lines but
2393,JOHN MCCRAE,"no answer. The poor old chap was fast asleep in his tracks, and in about"
2394,JOHN MCCRAE,thirty seconds too.
2395,JOHN MCCRAE,
2396,JOHN MCCRAE,This continuous marching is really hard work. The men at every halt just
2397,JOHN MCCRAE,drop down in the road and sleep until they are kicked up again in ten
2398,JOHN MCCRAE,"minutes. They do it willingly too. I am commanding officer, adjutant,"
2399,JOHN MCCRAE,"officer on duty, and all the rest since we left the main body. Talk"
2400,JOHN MCCRAE,about the Army in Flanders! You should hear this battalion. I always
2401,JOHN MCCRAE,"knew soldiers could swear, but you ought to hear these fellows. I am"
2402,JOHN MCCRAE,told the first contingent has got a name among the regulars.
2403,JOHN MCCRAE,

2407,JOHN MCCRAE,Three weeks later he writes:
2408,JOHN MCCRAE,

2410,JOHN MCCRAE,
2411,JOHN MCCRAE,"April 10th, 1900."
2412,JOHN MCCRAE,
2413,JOHN MCCRAE,"We certainly shall have done a good march when we get to the railroad,"
2414,JOHN MCCRAE,478 miles through a country desolate of forage carrying our own
2415,JOHN MCCRAE,"transport and one-half rations of forage, and frequently the men's"
2416,JOHN MCCRAE,rations. For two days running we had nine hours in the saddle without
2417,JOHN MCCRAE,"food. My throat was sore and swollen for a day or two, and I felt"
2418,JOHN MCCRAE,so sorry for myself at times that I laughed to think how I must have
2419,JOHN MCCRAE,"looked: sitting on a stone, drinking a pan of tea without trimmings,"
2420,JOHN MCCRAE,"that had got cold, and eating a shapeless lump of brown bread; my one"
2421,JOHN MCCRAE,"""hank"" drawn around my neck, serving as hank and bandage alternately. It"
2422,JOHN MCCRAE,is miserable to have to climb up on one's horse with a head like a
2423,JOHN MCCRAE,"buzz saw, the sun very hot, and ""gargle"" in one's water bottle. It is"
2424,JOHN MCCRAE,"surprising how I can go without water if I have to on a short stretch,"
2425,JOHN MCCRAE,"that is, of ten hours in the sun. It is after nightfall that the thirst"
2426,JOHN MCCRAE,really seems to attack one and actually gnaws. One thinks of all the
2427,JOHN MCCRAE,cool drinks and good things one would like to eat. Please understand
2428,JOHN MCCRAE,that this is not for one instant in any spirit of growling.
2429,JOHN MCCRAE,
2430,JOHN MCCRAE,
2431,JOHN MCCRAE,The detail was now established at Victoria Road. Three entries appear*:
2432,JOHN MCCRAE,

2438,JOHN MCCRAE,"April 23rd, 1900."
2439,JOHN MCCRAE,
2440,JOHN MCCRAE,"We are still here in camp hoping for orders to move, but they have not"
2441,JOHN MCCRAE,"yet come. Most of the other troops have gone. A squadron of the M.C.R.,"
2442,JOHN MCCRAE,"my messmates for the past five weeks, have gone and I am left an orphan."
2443,JOHN MCCRAE,"I was very sorry to see them go. They, in the kindness of their hearts,"
2444,JOHN MCCRAE,"say, if I get stranded, they will do the best they can to get a troop"
2445,JOHN MCCRAE,"for me in the squadron or some such employment. Impracticable, but kind."
2446,JOHN MCCRAE,I have no wish to cease to be a gunner.
2447,JOHN MCCRAE,
2448,JOHN MCCRAE,
2449,JOHN MCCRAE,
2450,JOHN MCCRAE,"Victoria Road, May 20th, 1900."
2451,JOHN MCCRAE,
2452,JOHN MCCRAE,"The horses are doing as well as one can expect, for the rations are"
2453,JOHN MCCRAE,insufficient. Our men have been helping to get ready a rest camp near
2454,JOHN MCCRAE,"us, and have been filling mattresses with hay. Every fatigue party comes"
2455,JOHN MCCRAE,"back from the hospital, their jackets bulging with hay for the horses."
2456,JOHN MCCRAE,"Two bales were condemned as too musty to put into the mattresses, and we"
2457,JOHN MCCRAE,were allowed to take them for the horses. They didn't leave a spear of
2458,JOHN MCCRAE,it. Isn't it pitiful? Everything that the heart of man and woman can
2459,JOHN MCCRAE,"devise has been sent out for the ""Tommies"", but no one thinks of the"
2460,JOHN MCCRAE,poor horses. They get the worst of it all the time. Even now we blush to
2461,JOHN MCCRAE,see the handful of hay that each horse gets at a feed.
2462,JOHN MCCRAE,
2463,JOHN MCCRAE,
2464,JOHN MCCRAE,The Boer War is so far off in time and space that a few further detached
2465,JOHN MCCRAE,references must suffice:
2466,JOHN MCCRAE,
2467,JOHN MCCRAE,
2468,JOHN MCCRAE,When riding into Bloemfontein met Lord----'s funeral at the cemetery
2469,JOHN MCCRAE,"gates,--band, firing party, Union Jack, and about three companies. A"
2470,JOHN MCCRAE,"few yards farther on a ""Tommy"" covered only by his blanket, escorted"
2471,JOHN MCCRAE,"by thirteen men all told, the last class distinction that the world can"
2472,JOHN MCCRAE,ever make.
2473,JOHN MCCRAE,
2474,JOHN MCCRAE,
2475,JOHN MCCRAE,We had our baptism of fire yesterday. They opened on us from the left
2476,JOHN MCCRAE,flank. Their first shell was about 150 yards in front--direction good.
2477,JOHN MCCRAE,The next was 100 yards over; and we thought we were bracketed. Some
2478,JOHN MCCRAE,shrapnel burst over us and scattered on all sides. I felt as if a hail
2479,JOHN MCCRAE,"storm was coming down, and wanted to turn my back, but it was over in"
2480,JOHN MCCRAE,an instant. The whistle of a shell is unpleasant. You hear it begin
2481,JOHN MCCRAE,to scream; the scream grows louder and louder; it seems to be coming
2482,JOHN MCCRAE,exactly your way; then you realize that it has gone over. Most of them
2483,JOHN MCCRAE,fell between our guns and wagons. Our position was quite in the open.

2488,JOHN MCCRAE,With Ian Hamilton's column near Balmoral.
2489,JOHN MCCRAE,
2490,JOHN MCCRAE,
2491,JOHN MCCRAE,"The day was cold, much like a December day at home, and by my kit going"
2492,JOHN MCCRAE,astray I had only light clothing. The rain was fearfully chilly. When we
2493,JOHN MCCRAE,"got in about dark we found that the transport could not come up, and it"
2494,JOHN MCCRAE,had all our blankets and coats. I had my cape and a rubber sheet for
2495,JOHN MCCRAE,"the saddle, both soaking wet. Being on duty I held to camp, the others"
2496,JOHN MCCRAE,"making for the house nearby where they got poor quarters. I bunked out,"
2497,JOHN MCCRAE,"supperless like every one else, under an ammunition wagon. It rained"
2498,JOHN MCCRAE,"most of the night and was bitterly cold. I slept at intervals, keeping"
2499,JOHN MCCRAE,"the same position all night, both legs in a puddle and my feet being"
2500,JOHN MCCRAE,rained on: it was a long night from dark at 5.30 to morning. Ten men
2501,JOHN MCCRAE,in the infantry regiment next us died during the night from exposure.
2502,JOHN MCCRAE,"Altogether I never knew such a night, and with decent luck hope never to"
2503,JOHN MCCRAE,see such another.
2504,JOHN MCCRAE,
2505,JOHN MCCRAE,
2506,JOHN MCCRAE,As we passed we saw the Connaughts looking at the graves of their
2507,JOHN MCCRAE,comrades of twenty years ago. The Battery rode at attention and gave
2508,JOHN MCCRAE,"""Eyes right"": the first time for twenty years that the roll of a British"
2509,JOHN MCCRAE,gun has broken in on the silence of those unnamed graves.
2510,JOHN MCCRAE,
2511,JOHN MCCRAE,"We were inspected by Lord Roberts. The battery turned out very smart,"
2512,JOHN MCCRAE,and Lord Roberts complimented the Major on its appearance. He then
2513,JOHN MCCRAE,"inspected, and afterwards asked to have the officers called out. We were"
2514,JOHN MCCRAE,"presented to him in turn; he spoke a few words to each of us, asking"
2515,JOHN MCCRAE,what our corps and service had been. He seemed surprised that we were
2516,JOHN MCCRAE,"all Field Artillery men, but probably the composition of the other"
2517,JOHN MCCRAE,Canadian units had to do with this. He asked a good many questions about
2518,JOHN MCCRAE,"the horses, the men, and particularly about the spirits of the men."
2519,JOHN MCCRAE,Altogether he showed a very kind interest in the battery.
2520,JOHN MCCRAE,
2521,JOHN MCCRAE,
2522,JOHN MCCRAE,"At nine took the Presbyterian parade to the lines, the first"
2523,JOHN MCCRAE,"Presbyterian service since we left Canada. We had the right, the Gordons"
2524,JOHN MCCRAE,"and the Royal Scots next. The music was excellent, led by the brass band"
2525,JOHN MCCRAE,"of the Royal Scots, which played extremely well. All the singing was"
2526,JOHN MCCRAE,"from the psalms and paraphrases: ""Old Hundred"" and ""Duke Street"""
2527,JOHN MCCRAE,among them. It was very pleasant to hear the old reliables once more.
2528,JOHN MCCRAE,"""McCrae's Covenanters"" some of the officers called us; but I should not"
2529,JOHN MCCRAE,like to set our conduct up against the standard of those austere men.
2530,JOHN MCCRAE,
2531,JOHN MCCRAE,
2532,JOHN MCCRAE,
2533,JOHN MCCRAE,
2534,JOHN MCCRAE,At Lyndenburg:
2535,JOHN MCCRAE,
2536,JOHN MCCRAE,
2537,JOHN MCCRAE,"The Boers opened on us at about 10,000 yards, the fire being accurate"
2538,JOHN MCCRAE,"from the first. They shelled us till dark, over three hours. The guns on"
2539,JOHN MCCRAE,"our left fired for a long time on Buller's camp, the ones on our right"
2540,JOHN MCCRAE,on us. We could see the smoke and flash; then there was a soul-consuming
2541,JOHN MCCRAE,"interval of 20 to 30 seconds when we would hear the report, and about"
2542,JOHN MCCRAE,five seconds later the burst. Many in succession burst over and all
2543,JOHN MCCRAE,around us. I picked up pieces which fell within a few feet. It was a
2544,JOHN MCCRAE,"trying afternoon, and we stood around wondering. We moved the horses"
2545,JOHN MCCRAE,"back, and took cover under the wagons. We were thankful when the sun"
2546,JOHN MCCRAE,"went down, especially as for the last hour of daylight they turned all"
2547,JOHN MCCRAE,their guns on us. The casualties were few.
2548,JOHN MCCRAE,
2549,JOHN MCCRAE,The next morning a heavy mist prevented the enemy from firing. The
2550,JOHN MCCRAE,division marched out at 7.30 A.M. The attack was made in three columns:
2551,JOHN MCCRAE,"cavalry brigade on the left; Buller's troops in the centre, Hamilton's"
2552,JOHN MCCRAE,on the right. The Canadian artillery were with Hamilton's division. The
2553,JOHN MCCRAE,approach to the hill was exposed everywhere except where some cover
2554,JOHN MCCRAE,"was afforded by ridges. We marched out as support to the Gordons, the"
2555,JOHN MCCRAE,cavalry and the Royal Horse Artillery going out to our right as a flank
2556,JOHN MCCRAE,guard. While we were waiting three 100-pound shells struck the top of
2557,JOHN MCCRAE,the ridge in succession about 50 to 75 yards in front of the battery
2558,JOHN MCCRAE,line. We began to feel rather shaky.
2559,JOHN MCCRAE,
2560,JOHN MCCRAE,On looking over the field at this time one could not tell that anything
2561,JOHN MCCRAE,was occurring except for the long range guns replying to the fire from
2562,JOHN MCCRAE,the hill. The enemy had opened fire as soon as our advance was pushed
2563,JOHN MCCRAE,out. With a glass one could distinguish the infantry pushing up in
2564,JOHN MCCRAE,"lines, five or six in succession, the men being some yards apart. Then"
2565,JOHN MCCRAE,"came a long pause, broken only by the big guns. At last we got the order"
2566,JOHN MCCRAE,to advance just as the big guns of the enemy stopped their fire. We
2567,JOHN MCCRAE,"advanced about four miles mostly up the slope, which is in all about"
2568,JOHN MCCRAE,"1500 feet high, over a great deal of rough ground and over a number of"
2569,JOHN MCCRAE,spruits. The horses were put to their utmost to draw the guns up the
2570,JOHN MCCRAE,hills. As we advanced we could see artillery crawling in from both
2571,JOHN MCCRAE,"flanks, all converging to the main hill, while far away the infantry and"
2572,JOHN MCCRAE,cavalry were beginning to crown the heights near us. Then the field
2573,JOHN MCCRAE,guns and the pompoms began to play. As the field guns came up to a broad
2574,JOHN MCCRAE,"plateau section after section came into action, and we fired shrapnel"
2575,JOHN MCCRAE,and lyddite on the crests ahead and to the left. Every now and then a
2576,JOHN MCCRAE,rattle of Mausers and Metfords would tell us that the infantry were at
2577,JOHN MCCRAE,"their work, but practically the battle was over. From being an infantry"
2578,JOHN MCCRAE,"attack as expected it was the gunners' day, and the artillery seemed to"
2579,JOHN MCCRAE,do excellent work.
2580,JOHN MCCRAE,
2581,JOHN MCCRAE,"General Buller pushed up the hill as the guns were at work, and"
2582,JOHN MCCRAE,"afterwards General Hamilton; the one as grim as his pictures, the other"
2583,JOHN MCCRAE,looking very happy. The wind blew through us cold like ice as we stood
2584,JOHN MCCRAE,on the hill; as the artillery ceased fire the mist dropped over us
2585,JOHN MCCRAE,chilling us to the bone. We were afraid we should have to spend the
2586,JOHN MCCRAE,"night on the hill, but a welcome order came sending us back to camp, a"
2587,JOHN MCCRAE,"distance of five miles by the roads, as Buller would hold the hill, and"
2588,JOHN MCCRAE,our force must march south. Our front was over eight miles wide and the
2589,JOHN MCCRAE,"objective 1500 feet higher than our camp, and over six miles away. If"
2590,JOHN MCCRAE,"the enemy had had the nerve to stand, the position could scarcely have"
2591,JOHN MCCRAE,been taken; certainly not without the loss of thousands.
2592,JOHN MCCRAE,
2593,JOHN MCCRAE,
2594,JOHN MCCRAE,For this campaign he received the Queen's Medal with three clasps.

2599,JOHN MCCRAE,VI. Children and Animals
2600,JOHN MCCRAE,
2601,JOHN MCCRAE,
2602,JOHN MCCRAE,"Through all his life, and through all his letters, dogs and children"
2603,JOHN MCCRAE,followed him as shadows follow men. To walk in the streets with him was
2604,JOHN MCCRAE,"a slow procession. Every dog and every child one met must be spoken to,"
2605,JOHN MCCRAE,and each made answer. Throughout the later letters the names Bonfire and
2606,JOHN MCCRAE,"Bonneau occur continually. Bonfire was his horse, and Bonneau his dog."
2607,JOHN MCCRAE,
2608,JOHN MCCRAE,"This horse, an Irish hunter, was given to him by John L. Todd. It was"
2609,JOHN MCCRAE,"wounded twice, and now lives in honourable retirement at a secret place"
2610,JOHN MCCRAE,which need not be disclosed to the army authorities. One officer who
2611,JOHN MCCRAE,had visited the hospital writes of seeing him going about the wards with
2612,JOHN MCCRAE,Bonneau and a small French child following after. In memory of his love
2613,JOHN MCCRAE,for animals and children the following extracts will serve:
2614,JOHN MCCRAE,
2615,JOHN MCCRAE,
2616,JOHN MCCRAE,"You ask if the wee fellow has a name--Mike, mostly, as a term of"
2617,JOHN MCCRAE,"affection. He has found a cupboard in one ward in which oakum is stored,"
2618,JOHN MCCRAE,"and he loves to steal in there and ""pick oakum"", amusing himself as long"
2619,JOHN MCCRAE,as is permitted. I hold that this indicates convict ancestry to which
2620,JOHN MCCRAE,Mike makes no defence.
2621,JOHN MCCRAE,
2622,JOHN MCCRAE,
2623,JOHN MCCRAE,"The family is very well, even one-eyed Mike is able to go round the yard"
2624,JOHN MCCRAE,"in his dressing-gown, so to speak. He is a queer pathetic little beast"
2625,JOHN MCCRAE,"and Madame has him ""hospitalized"" on the bottom shelf of the sideboard"
2626,JOHN MCCRAE,"in the living room, whence he comes down (six inches to the floor) to"
2627,JOHN MCCRAE,"greet me, and then gravely hirples back, the hind legs looking very"
2628,JOHN MCCRAE,pathetic as he hops in. But he is full of spirit and is doing very well.
2629,JOHN MCCRAE,
2630,JOHN MCCRAE,
2631,JOHN MCCRAE,"As to the animals--""those poor voiceless creatures,"" say you. I wish you"
2632,JOHN MCCRAE,could hear them. Bonneau and Mike are a perfect Dignity and Impudence;
2633,JOHN MCCRAE,and both vocal to a wonderful degree. Mike's face is exactly like the
2634,JOHN MCCRAE,"terrier in the old picture, and he sits up and gives his paw just like"
2635,JOHN MCCRAE,"Bonneau, and I never saw him have any instruction; and as for voice,"
2636,JOHN MCCRAE,"I wish you could hear Bonfire's ""whicker"" to me in the stable or"
2637,JOHN MCCRAE,elsewhere. It is all but talk. There is one ward door that he tries
2638,JOHN MCCRAE,"whenever we pass. He turns his head around, looks into the door, and"
2639,JOHN MCCRAE,"waits. The Sisters in the ward have changed frequently, but all alike"
2640,JOHN MCCRAE,"""fall for it"", as they say, and produce a biscuit or some such dainty"
2641,JOHN MCCRAE,which Bonfire takes with much gravity and gentleness. Should I chide
2642,JOHN MCCRAE,"him for being too eager and give him my hand saying, ""Gentle now,"" he"
2643,JOHN MCCRAE,"mumbles with his lips, and licks with his tongue like a dog to show how"
2644,JOHN MCCRAE,gentle he can be when he tries. Truly a great boy is that same. On this
2645,JOHN MCCRAE,"subject I am like a doting grandmother, but forgive it."
2646,JOHN MCCRAE,
2647,JOHN MCCRAE,"I have a very deep affection for Bonfire, for we have been through so"
2648,JOHN MCCRAE,"much together, and some of it bad enough. All the hard spots to which"
2649,JOHN MCCRAE,"one's memory turns the old fellow has shared, though he says so little"
2650,JOHN MCCRAE,about it.
2651,JOHN MCCRAE,
2652,JOHN MCCRAE,
2653,JOHN MCCRAE,This love of animals was no vagrant mood. Fifteen years before in South
2654,JOHN MCCRAE,"Africa he wrote in his diary under date of September 11th, 1900:"
2655,JOHN MCCRAE,
2656,JOHN MCCRAE,
2657,JOHN MCCRAE,I wish I could introduce you to the dogs of the force. The genus dog
2658,JOHN MCCRAE,"here is essentially sociable, and it is a great pleasure to have them"
2659,JOHN MCCRAE,about. I think I have a personal acquaintance with them all. There
2660,JOHN MCCRAE,"are our pups--Dolly, whom I always know by her one black and one white"
2661,JOHN MCCRAE,"eyebrow; Grit and Tory, two smaller gentlemen, about the size of a pound"
2662,JOHN MCCRAE,"of butter--and fighters; one small white gentleman who rides on a horse,"
2663,JOHN MCCRAE,"on the blanket; Kitty, the monkey, also rides the off lead of the forge"
2664,JOHN MCCRAE,wagon. There is a black almond-eyed person belonging to the Royal
2665,JOHN MCCRAE,"Scots, who begins to twist as far as I can see her, and comes up in long"
2666,JOHN MCCRAE,"curves, extremely genially. A small shaggy chap who belongs to the Royal"
2667,JOHN MCCRAE,Irish stands upon his hind legs and spars with his front feet--and lots
2668,JOHN MCCRAE,"of others--every one of them ""a soldier and a man"". The Royal Scots have"
2669,JOHN MCCRAE,"a monkey, Jenny, who goes around always trailing a sack in her hand,"
2670,JOHN MCCRAE,into which she creeps if necessary to obtain shelter.
2671,JOHN MCCRAE,
2672,JOHN MCCRAE,"The other day old Jack, my horse, was bitten by his next neighbor; he"
2673,JOHN MCCRAE,"turned SLOWLY, eyed his opponent, shifted his rope so that he had a"
2674,JOHN MCCRAE,"little more room, turned very deliberately, and planted both heels in"
2675,JOHN MCCRAE,the offender's stomach. He will not be run upon.
2676,JOHN MCCRAE,
2677,JOHN MCCRAE,
2678,JOHN MCCRAE,From a time still further back comes a note in a like strain. In 1898 he
2679,JOHN MCCRAE,"was house physician in a children's hospital at Mt. Airy, Maryland, when"
2680,JOHN MCCRAE,he wrote:
2681,JOHN MCCRAE,
2682,JOHN MCCRAE,
2683,JOHN MCCRAE,A kitten has taken up with a poor cripple dying of muscular atrophy who
2684,JOHN MCCRAE,"cannot move. It stays with him all the time, and sleeps most of the"
2685,JOHN MCCRAE,day in his straw hat. To-night I saw the kitten curled up under the
2686,JOHN MCCRAE,bed-clothes. It seems as if it were a gift of Providence that the little
2687,JOHN MCCRAE,creature should attach itself to the child who needs it most.
2688,JOHN MCCRAE,
2689,JOHN MCCRAE,
2690,JOHN MCCRAE,Of another child:
2691,JOHN MCCRAE,
2692,JOHN MCCRAE,
2693,JOHN MCCRAE,"The day she died she called for me all day, deposed the nurse who was"
2694,JOHN MCCRAE,"sitting by her, and asked me to remain with her. She had to be held up"
2695,JOHN MCCRAE,on account of lack of breath; and I had a tiring hour of it before she
2696,JOHN MCCRAE,"died, but it seemed to make her happier and was no great sacrifice. Her"
2697,JOHN MCCRAE,friends arrived twenty minutes too late. It seems hard that Death will
2698,JOHN MCCRAE,"not wait the poor fraction of an hour, but so it is."
2699,JOHN MCCRAE,
2700,JOHN MCCRAE,
2701,JOHN MCCRAE,And here are some letters to his nephews and nieces which reveal his
2702,JOHN MCCRAE,attitude both to children and to animals.
2703,JOHN MCCRAE,

2706,JOHN MCCRAE,From Bonfire to Sergt.-Major Jack Kilgour
2707,JOHN MCCRAE,
2708,JOHN MCCRAE,"August 6th, 1916."
2709,JOHN MCCRAE,
2710,JOHN MCCRAE,"Did you ever have a sore hock? I have one now, and Cruickshank puts"
2711,JOHN MCCRAE,bandages on my leg. He also washed my white socks for me. I am glad you
2712,JOHN MCCRAE,"got my picture. My master is well, and the girls tell me I am looking"
2713,JOHN MCCRAE,"well, too. The ones I like best give me biscuits and sugar, and"
2714,JOHN MCCRAE,sometimes flowers. One of them did not want to give me some mignonette
2715,JOHN MCCRAE,the other day because she said it would make me sick. It did not make me
2716,JOHN MCCRAE,sick. Another one sends me bags of carrots. If you don't know how to eat
2717,JOHN MCCRAE,"carrots, tops and all, you had better learn, but I suppose you are just"
2718,JOHN MCCRAE,"a boy, and do not know how good oats are."

2721,JOHN MCCRAE,

2724,JOHN MCCRAE,

2726,JOHN MCCRAE,
2727,JOHN MCCRAE,From Bonfire to Sergt.-Major Jack Kilgour
2728,JOHN MCCRAE,
2729,JOHN MCCRAE,"October 1st, 1916."
2730,JOHN MCCRAE,
2731,JOHN MCCRAE,"Dear Jack,"
2732,JOHN MCCRAE,
2733,JOHN MCCRAE,Did you ever eat blackberries? My master and I pick them every day on
2734,JOHN MCCRAE,the hedges. I like twenty at a time. My leg is better but I have a lump
2735,JOHN MCCRAE,"on my tummy. I went to see my doctor to-day, and he says it is nothing"
2736,JOHN MCCRAE,"at all. I have another horse staying in my stable now; he is black, and"
2737,JOHN MCCRAE,"about half my size. He does not keep me awake at night. Yours truly,"
2738,JOHN MCCRAE,
2739,JOHN MCCRAE,BONFIRE His * Mark.
2740,JOHN MCCRAE,
2741,JOHN MCCRAE,
2742,JOHN MCCRAE,
2743,JOHN MCCRAE,"From Bonfire to Margaret Kilgour, Civilian"
2744,JOHN MCCRAE,
2745,JOHN MCCRAE,"November 5th, 1916."
2746,JOHN MCCRAE,
2747,JOHN MCCRAE,Dear Margaret:
2748,JOHN MCCRAE,
2749,JOHN MCCRAE,This is Guy Fox Day! I spell it that way because fox-hunting was my
2750,JOHN MCCRAE,occupation a long time ago before the war. How are Sergt.-Major Jack and
2751,JOHN MCCRAE,"Corporal David? Ask Jack if he ever bites through his rope at night, and"
2752,JOHN MCCRAE,"gets into the oat-box. And as for the Corporal, ""I bet you"" I can jump"
2753,JOHN MCCRAE,as far as he can. I hear David has lost his red coat. I still have my
2754,JOHN MCCRAE,"grey one, but it is pretty dirty now, for I have not had a new one for"
2755,JOHN MCCRAE,a long time. I got my hair cut a few weeks ago and am to have new boots
2756,JOHN MCCRAE,"next week. Bonneau and Follette send their love. Yours truly,"
2757,JOHN MCCRAE,
2758,JOHN MCCRAE,BONFIRE His * Mark.
2759,JOHN MCCRAE,
2760,JOHN MCCRAE,
2761,JOHN MCCRAE,
2762,JOHN MCCRAE,"In Flanders, April 3rd, 1915."
2763,JOHN MCCRAE,
2764,JOHN MCCRAE,My dear Margaret:
2765,JOHN MCCRAE,
2766,JOHN MCCRAE,There is a little girl in this house whose name is Clothilde. She is ten
2767,JOHN MCCRAE,"years old, and calls me ""Monsieur le Major"". How would you like it if"
2768,JOHN MCCRAE,twenty or thirty soldiers came along and lived in your house and put
2769,JOHN MCCRAE,their horses in the shed or the stable? There are not many little boys
2770,JOHN MCCRAE,"and girls left in this part of the country, but occasionally one meets"
2771,JOHN MCCRAE,them on the roads with baskets of eggs or loaves of bread. Most of them
2772,JOHN MCCRAE,"have no homes, for their houses have been burnt by the Germans; but they"
2773,JOHN MCCRAE,"do not cry over it. It is dangerous for them, for a shell might hit them"
2774,JOHN MCCRAE,"at any time--and it would not be an eggshell, either."
2775,JOHN MCCRAE,
2776,JOHN MCCRAE,"Bonfire is very well. Mother sent him some packets of sugar, and if ever"
2777,JOHN MCCRAE,"you saw a big horse excited about a little parcel, it was Bonfire. He"
2778,JOHN MCCRAE,"can have only two lumps in any one day, for there is not much of it."
2779,JOHN MCCRAE,Twice he has had gingerbread and he is very fond of that. It is rather
2780,JOHN MCCRAE,"funny for a soldier-horse, is it not? But soldier horses have a pretty"
2781,JOHN MCCRAE,"hard time of it, sometimes, so we do not grudge them a little luxury."
2782,JOHN MCCRAE,"Bonfire's friends are King, and Prince, and Saxonia,--all nice big boys."
2783,JOHN MCCRAE,"If they go away and leave him, he whinnies till he catches sight of"
2784,JOHN MCCRAE,"them again, and then he is quite happy. How is the 15th Street Brigade"
2785,JOHN MCCRAE,getting on? Tell Mother I recommend Jack for promotion to corporal if
2786,JOHN MCCRAE,"he has been good. David will have to be a gunner for awhile yet, for"
2787,JOHN MCCRAE,"everybody cannot be promoted. Give my love to Katharine, and Jack, and"
2788,JOHN MCCRAE,David.
2789,JOHN MCCRAE,
2790,JOHN MCCRAE,Your affectionate uncle Jack.
2791,JOHN MCCRAE,
2792,JOHN MCCRAE,
2793,JOHN MCCRAE,
2794,JOHN MCCRAE,"Bonfire, and Bonneau, and little Mike, are all well. Mike is about four"
2795,JOHN MCCRAE,"months old and has lost an eye and had a leg broken, but he is a very"
2796,JOHN MCCRAE,"good little boy all the same. He is very fond of Bonfire, and Bonneau,"
2797,JOHN MCCRAE,"and me. I go to the stable and whistle, and Bonneau and Mike come"
2798,JOHN MCCRAE,"running out squealing with joy, to go for a little walk with me. When"
2799,JOHN MCCRAE,"Mike comes to steps, he puts his feet on the lowest steps and turns and"
2800,JOHN MCCRAE,looks at me and I lift him up. He is a dear ugly little chap.
2801,JOHN MCCRAE,
2802,JOHN MCCRAE,The dogs are often to be seen sprawled on the floor of my tent. I like
2803,JOHN MCCRAE,to have them there for they are very home-like beasts. They never seem
2804,JOHN MCCRAE,"French to me. Bonneau can ""donner la patte"" in good style nowadays, and"
2805,JOHN MCCRAE,"he sometimes curls up inside the rabbit hutch, and the rabbits seem to"
2806,JOHN MCCRAE,like him.
2807,JOHN MCCRAE,
2808,JOHN MCCRAE,I wish you could see the hundreds of rabbits there are here on the
2809,JOHN MCCRAE,sand-dunes; there are also many larks and jackdaws. (These are different
2810,JOHN MCCRAE,"from your brother Jack, although they have black faces.) There are"
2811,JOHN MCCRAE,"herons, curlews, and even ducks; and the other day I saw four young"
2812,JOHN MCCRAE,"weasels in a heap, jumping over each other from side to side as they"
2813,JOHN MCCRAE,ran.
2814,JOHN MCCRAE,
2815,JOHN MCCRAE,"Sir Bertrand Dawson has a lovely little spaniel, Sue, quite black, who"
2816,JOHN MCCRAE,"goes around with him. I am quite a favourite, and one day Sir Bertrand"
2817,JOHN MCCRAE,"said to me, ""She has brought you a present,"" and here she was waiting"
2818,JOHN MCCRAE,earnestly for me to remove from her mouth a small stone. It is usually a
2819,JOHN MCCRAE,"simple gift, I notice, and does not embarrass by its value."
2820,JOHN MCCRAE,
2821,JOHN MCCRAE,"Bonfire is very sleek and trim, and we journey much. If I sit down in"
2822,JOHN MCCRAE,his reach I wish you could see how deftly he can pick off my cap and
2823,JOHN MCCRAE,swing it high out of my reach. He also carries my crop; his games are
2824,JOHN MCCRAE,"simple, but he does not readily tire of them."
2825,JOHN MCCRAE,
2826,JOHN MCCRAE,I lost poor old Windy. He was the regimental dog of the 1st Batt.
2827,JOHN MCCRAE,"Lincolns, and came to this vale of Avalon to be healed of his second"
2828,JOHN MCCRAE,"wound. He spent a year at Gallipoli and was ""over the top"" twice with"
2829,JOHN MCCRAE,"his battalion. He came to us with his papers like any other patient, and"
2830,JOHN MCCRAE,"did very well for a while, but took suddenly worse. He had all that care"
2831,JOHN MCCRAE,and love could suggest and enough morphine to keep the pain down; but he
2832,JOHN MCCRAE,"was very pathetic, and I had resolved that it would be true friendship"
2833,JOHN MCCRAE,"to help him over when he ""went west"". He is buried in our woods like"
2834,JOHN MCCRAE,"any other good soldier, and yesterday I noticed that some one has laid"
2835,JOHN MCCRAE,"a little wreath of ivy on his grave. He was an old dog evidently, but"
2836,JOHN MCCRAE,we are all sore-hearted at losing him. His kit is kept should his master
2837,JOHN MCCRAE,"return,--only his collar with his honourable marks, for his wardrobe was"
2838,JOHN MCCRAE,of necessity simple. So another sad chapter ends.
2839,JOHN MCCRAE,
2840,JOHN MCCRAE,
2841,JOHN MCCRAE,
2842,JOHN MCCRAE,"September 29th, 1915."
2843,JOHN MCCRAE,
2844,JOHN MCCRAE,"Bonneau gravely accompanies me round the wards and waits for me, sitting"
2845,JOHN MCCRAE,up in a most dignified way. He comes into my tent and sits there very
2846,JOHN MCCRAE,gravely while I dress. Two days ago a Sister brought out some biscuits
2847,JOHN MCCRAE,"for Bonfire, and not understanding the rules of the game, which are bit"
2848,JOHN MCCRAE,"and bit about for Bonfire and Bonneau, gave all to Bonfire, so that"
2849,JOHN MCCRAE,poor Bonneau sat below and caught the crumbs that fell. I can see that
2850,JOHN MCCRAE,Bonfire makes a great hit with the Sisters because he licks their hands
2851,JOHN MCCRAE,"just like a dog, and no crumb is too small to be gone after."
2852,JOHN MCCRAE,
2853,JOHN MCCRAE,
2854,JOHN MCCRAE,
2855,JOHN MCCRAE,"April, 1917."
2856,JOHN MCCRAE,
2857,JOHN MCCRAE,I was glad to get back; Bonfire and Bonneau greeted me very
2858,JOHN MCCRAE,"enthusiastically. I had a long long story from the dog, delivered with"
2859,JOHN MCCRAE,uplifted muzzle. They tell me he sat gravely on the roads a great deal
2860,JOHN MCCRAE,"during my absence, and all his accustomed haunts missed him. He is back"
2861,JOHN MCCRAE,on rounds faithfully.
2862,JOHN MCCRAE,
2863,JOHN MCCRAE,
2864,JOHN MCCRAE,
2865,JOHN MCCRAE,
2866,JOHN MCCRAE,VII. The Old Land and the New
2867,JOHN MCCRAE,
2868,JOHN MCCRAE,
2869,JOHN MCCRAE,If one were engaged upon a formal work of biography rather than a mere
2870,JOHN MCCRAE,"essay in character, it would be just and proper to investigate the"
2871,JOHN MCCRAE,family sources from which the individual member is sprung; but I must
2872,JOHN MCCRAE,"content myself within the bounds which I have set, and leave the larger"
2873,JOHN MCCRAE,task to a more laborious hand. The essence of history lies in the
2874,JOHN MCCRAE,"character of the persons concerned, rather than in the feats which"
2875,JOHN MCCRAE,they performed. A man neither lives to himself nor in himself. He is
2876,JOHN MCCRAE,"indissolubly bound up with his stock, and can only explain himself in"
2877,JOHN MCCRAE,terms common to his family; but in doing so he transcends the limits of
2878,JOHN MCCRAE,"history, and passes into the realms of philosophy and religion."
2879,JOHN MCCRAE,
2880,JOHN MCCRAE,"The life of a Canadian is bound up with the history of his parish, of"
2881,JOHN MCCRAE,"his town, of his province, of his country, and even with the history of"
2882,JOHN MCCRAE,that country in which his family had its birth. The life of John McCrae
2883,JOHN MCCRAE,takes us back to Scotland. In Canada there has been much writing of
2884,JOHN MCCRAE,history of a certain kind. It deals with events rather than with the
2885,JOHN MCCRAE,"subtler matter of people, and has been written mainly for purposes of"
2886,JOHN MCCRAE,"advertising. If the French made a heroic stand against the Iroquois, the"
2887,JOHN MCCRAE,sacred spot is now furnished with an hotel from which a free 'bus runs
2888,JOHN MCCRAE,to a station upon the line of an excellent railway. Maisonneuve fought
2889,JOHN MCCRAE,his great fight upon a place from which a vicious mayor cut the trees
2890,JOHN MCCRAE,"which once sheltered the soldier, to make way for a fountain upon which"
2891,JOHN MCCRAE,"would be raised ""historical"" figures in concrete stone."
2892,JOHN MCCRAE,
2893,JOHN MCCRAE,"The history of Canada is the history of its people, not of its railways,"
2894,JOHN MCCRAE,"hotels, and factories. The material exists in written or printed form in"
2895,JOHN MCCRAE,the little archives of many a family. Such a chronicle is in possession
2896,JOHN MCCRAE,of the Eckford family which now by descent on the female side bears the
2897,JOHN MCCRAE,"honoured names of Gow, and McCrae. John Eckford had two daughters, in"
2898,JOHN MCCRAE,"the words of old Jamie Young, ""the most lovingest girls he ever knew."""
2899,JOHN MCCRAE,"The younger, Janet Simpson, was taken to wife by David McCrae, 21st"
2900,JOHN MCCRAE,"January, 1870, and on November 30th, 1872, became the mother of John. To"
2901,JOHN MCCRAE,"her he wrote all these letters, glowing with filial devotion, which I am"
2902,JOHN MCCRAE,privileged to use so freely.
2903,JOHN MCCRAE,
2904,JOHN MCCRAE,There is in the family a tradition of the single name for the males. It
2905,JOHN MCCRAE,"was therefore proper that the elder born should be called Thomas, more"
2906,JOHN MCCRAE,"learned in medicine, more assiduous in practice, and more weighty in"
2907,JOHN MCCRAE,intellect even than the otherwise more highly gifted John. He too is
2908,JOHN MCCRAE,"professor of medicine, and co-author of a profound work with his master"
2909,JOHN MCCRAE,"and relative by marriage--Sir William Osler. Also, he wore the King's"
2910,JOHN MCCRAE,uniform and served in the present war.
2911,JOHN MCCRAE,
2912,JOHN MCCRAE,"This John Eckford, accompanied by his two daughters, the mother being"
2913,JOHN MCCRAE,"dead, his sister, her husband who bore the name of Chisholm, and their"
2914,JOHN MCCRAE,"numerous children emigrated to Canada, May 28th, 1851, in the ship"
2915,JOHN MCCRAE,"'Clutha' which sailed from the Broomielaw bound for Quebec. The consort,"
2916,JOHN MCCRAE,"'Wolfville', upon which they had originally taken passage, arrived in"
2917,JOHN MCCRAE,"Quebec before them, and lay in the stream, flying the yellow flag of"
2918,JOHN MCCRAE,"quarantine. Cholera had broken out. ""Be still, and see the salvation of"
2919,JOHN MCCRAE,"the Lord,"" were the words of the family morning prayers."
2920,JOHN MCCRAE,
2921,JOHN MCCRAE,In the 'Clutha' also came as passengers James and Mary Gow; their
2922,JOHN MCCRAE,"cousin, one Duncan Monach; Mrs. Hanning, who was a sister of Thomas"
2923,JOHN MCCRAE,Carlyle; and her two daughters. On the voyage they escaped the usual
2924,JOHN MCCRAE,"hardships, and their fare appears to us in these days to have been"
2925,JOHN MCCRAE,"abundant. The weekly ration was three quarts of water, two ounces of"
2926,JOHN MCCRAE,"tea, one half pound of sugar, one half pound molasses, three pounds"
2927,JOHN MCCRAE,"of bread, one pound of flour, two pounds of rice, and five pounds of"
2928,JOHN MCCRAE,oatmeal.
2929,JOHN MCCRAE,
2930,JOHN MCCRAE,The reason for this migration is succinctly stated by the head of the
2931,JOHN MCCRAE,"house. ""I know how hard it was for my mother to start me, and I wanted"
2932,JOHN MCCRAE,"land for my children and a better opportunity for them."" And yet his"
2933,JOHN MCCRAE,"parents in their time appear to have ""started"" him pretty well, although"
2934,JOHN MCCRAE,"his father was obliged to confess, ""I never had more of this world's"
2935,JOHN MCCRAE,"goods than to bring up my family by the labour of my hands honestly,"
2936,JOHN MCCRAE,"but it is more than my Master owned, who had not where to lay His head."""
2937,JOHN MCCRAE,"They allowed him that very best means of education, a calmness of the"
2938,JOHN MCCRAE,"senses, as he herded sheep on the Cheviot Hills. They put him to the"
2939,JOHN MCCRAE,"University in Edinburgh, as a preparation for the ministry, and supplied"
2940,JOHN MCCRAE,"him with ample oatmeal, peasemeal bannocks, and milk. In that great"
2941,JOHN MCCRAE,"school of divinity he learned the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin; he studied"
2942,JOHN MCCRAE,"Italian, and French under Surenne, him of blessed memory even unto this"
2943,JOHN MCCRAE,day.
2944,JOHN MCCRAE,
2945,JOHN MCCRAE,"John Eckford in 1839 married Margaret Christie, and he went far afield"
2946,JOHN MCCRAE,"for a wife, namely from Newbiggin in Forfar, where for fourteen years"
2947,JOHN MCCRAE,"he had his one and only charge, to Strathmiglo in Fife. The marriage was"
2948,JOHN MCCRAE,"fruitful and a happy one, although there is a hint in the record of some"
2949,JOHN MCCRAE,religious difference upon which one would like to dwell if the subject
2950,JOHN MCCRAE,were not too esoteric for this generation. The minister showed a
2951,JOHN MCCRAE,"certain indulgence, and so long as his wife lived he never employed the"
2952,JOHN MCCRAE,paraphrases in the solemn worship of the sanctuary. She was a woman of
2953,JOHN MCCRAE,provident mind. Shortly after they were married he made the discovery
2954,JOHN MCCRAE,that she had prepared the grave clothes for him as well as for herself.
2955,JOHN MCCRAE,"Too soon, after only eight years, it was her fate to be shrouded in"
2956,JOHN MCCRAE,them. After her death--probably because of her death--John Eckford
2957,JOHN MCCRAE,emigrated to Canada.
2958,JOHN MCCRAE,
2959,JOHN MCCRAE,To one who knows the early days in Canada there is nothing new in
2960,JOHN MCCRAE,"the story of this family. They landed in Montreal July 11th, 1851,"
2961,JOHN MCCRAE,"forty-four days out from Glasgow. They proceeded by steamer to Hamilton,"
2962,JOHN MCCRAE,the fare being about a dollar for each passenger. The next stage was
2963,JOHN MCCRAE,"to Guelph; then on to Durham, and finally they came to the end of their"
2964,JOHN MCCRAE,"journeying near Walkerton in Bruce County in the primeval forest, from"
2965,JOHN MCCRAE,which they cut out a home for themselves and for their children.
2966,JOHN MCCRAE,
2967,JOHN MCCRAE,"It was ""the winter of the deep snow"". One transcription from the record"
2968,JOHN MCCRAE,will disclose the scene:
2969,JOHN MCCRAE,
2970,JOHN MCCRAE,
2971,JOHN MCCRAE,At length a grave was dug on a knoll in the bush
2972,JOHN MCCRAE,at the foot of a great maple with a young snow-laden hemlock at the side.
2973,JOHN MCCRAE,The father and the eldest brother carried the box
2974,JOHN MCCRAE,along the shovelled path.  The mother close behind was followed
2975,JOHN MCCRAE,by the two families.  The snow was falling heavily.  At the grave
2976,JOHN MCCRAE,"John Eckford read a psalm, and prayed, ""that they might be enabled"
2977,JOHN MCCRAE,"to believe, the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting"
2978,JOHN MCCRAE,"unto them that fear Him."""
2979,JOHN MCCRAE,
2980,JOHN MCCRAE,
2981,JOHN MCCRAE,John McCrae himself was an indefatigable church-goer. There is a note in
2982,JOHN MCCRAE,"childish characters written from Edinburgh in his thirteenth year, ""On"
2983,JOHN MCCRAE,"Sabbath went to service four times."" There the statement stands in all"
2984,JOHN MCCRAE,its austerity. A letter from a chaplain is extant in which a certain
2985,JOHN MCCRAE,mild wonder is expressed at the regularity in attendance of an officer
2986,JOHN MCCRAE,of field rank. To his sure taste in poetry the hymns were a sore trial.
2987,JOHN MCCRAE,"""Only forty minutes are allowed for the service,"" he said, ""and it is"
2988,JOHN MCCRAE,"sad to see them 'snappit up' by these poor bald four-line things."""
2989,JOHN MCCRAE,
2990,JOHN MCCRAE,"On Easter Sunday, 1915, he wrote: ""We had a church parade this morning,"
2991,JOHN MCCRAE,"the first since we arrived in France. Truly, if the dead rise not, we"
2992,JOHN MCCRAE,"are of all men the most miserable."" On the funeral service of a friend"
2993,JOHN MCCRAE,"he remarks: ""'Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God,'--what a"
2994,JOHN MCCRAE,"summary of the whole thing that is!"" On many occasions he officiated in"
2995,JOHN MCCRAE,the absence of the chaplains who in those days would have as many as
2996,JOHN MCCRAE,six services a day. In civil life in Montreal he went to church in the
2997,JOHN MCCRAE,"evening, and sat under the Reverend James Barclay of St. Pauls, now"
2998,JOHN MCCRAE,designated by some at least as St. Andrews.

3003,JOHN MCCRAE,VIII. The Civil Years
3004,JOHN MCCRAE,
3005,JOHN MCCRAE,
3006,JOHN MCCRAE,It will be observed in this long relation of John McCrae that little
3007,JOHN MCCRAE,mention has yet been made of what after all was his main concern in
3008,JOHN MCCRAE,life. For twenty years he studied and practised medicine. To the end
3009,JOHN MCCRAE,he was an assiduous student and a very profound practitioner. He was
3010,JOHN MCCRAE,"a student, not of medicine alone, but of all subjects ancillary to"
3011,JOHN MCCRAE,"the science, and to the task he came with a mind braced by a sound and"
3012,JOHN MCCRAE,generous education. Any education of real value a man must have received
3013,JOHN MCCRAE,before he has attained to the age of seven years. Indeed he may be left
3014,JOHN MCCRAE,impervious to its influence at seven weeks. John McCrae's education
3015,JOHN MCCRAE,"began well. It began in the time of his two grandfathers at least, was"
3016,JOHN MCCRAE,continued by his father and mother before he came upon this world's
3017,JOHN MCCRAE,"scene, and by them was left deep founded for him to build upon."
3018,JOHN MCCRAE,
3019,JOHN MCCRAE,Noble natures have a repugnance from work. Manual labour is servitude.
3020,JOHN MCCRAE,A day of idleness is a holy day. For those whose means do not permit
3021,JOHN MCCRAE,to live in idleness the school is the only refuge; but they must prove
3022,JOHN MCCRAE,their quality. This is the goal which drives many Scotch boys to the
3023,JOHN MCCRAE,"University, scorning delights and willing to live long, mind-laborious"
3024,JOHN MCCRAE,days.
3025,JOHN MCCRAE,
3026,JOHN MCCRAE,"John McCrae's father felt bound ""to give the boy a chance,"" but the boy"
3027,JOHN MCCRAE,"must pass the test. The test in such cases is the Shorter Catechism,"
3028,JOHN MCCRAE,that compendium of all intellectual argument. How the faithful aspirant
3029,JOHN MCCRAE,for the school acquires this body of written knowledge at a time when
3030,JOHN MCCRAE,he has not yet learned the use of letters is a secret not to be lightly
3031,JOHN MCCRAE,disclosed. It may indeed be that already his education is complete. Upon
3032,JOHN MCCRAE,"the little book is always printed the table of multiples, so that the"
3033,JOHN MCCRAE,"obvious truth which is comprised in the statement, ""two by two makes"
3034,JOHN MCCRAE,"four"", is imputed to the contents which are within the cover. In"
3035,JOHN MCCRAE,"studying the table the catechism is learned surreptitiously, and"
3036,JOHN MCCRAE,therefore without self-consciousness.
3037,JOHN MCCRAE,
3038,JOHN MCCRAE,"So, in this well ordered family with its atmosphere of obedience, we"
3039,JOHN MCCRAE,"may see the boy, like a youthful Socrates going about with a copy of the"
3040,JOHN MCCRAE,"book in his hand, enquiring of those, who could already read, not alone"
3041,JOHN MCCRAE,what were the answers to the questions but the very questions themselves
3042,JOHN MCCRAE,to which an answer was demanded.
3043,JOHN MCCRAE,
3044,JOHN MCCRAE,"This learning, however, was only a minor part of life, since upon a"
3045,JOHN MCCRAE,farm life is very wide and very deep. In due time the school was
3046,JOHN MCCRAE,"accomplished, and there was a master in the school--let his name be"
3047,JOHN MCCRAE,"recorded--William Tytler, who had a feeling for English writing and a"
3048,JOHN MCCRAE,desire to extend that feeling to others.
3049,JOHN MCCRAE,
3050,JOHN MCCRAE,In due time also the question of a University arose. There was a man
3051,JOHN MCCRAE,in Canada named Dawson--Sir William Dawson. I have written of him in
3052,JOHN MCCRAE,another place. He had the idea that a university had something to do
3053,JOHN MCCRAE,"with the formation of character, and that in the formation of character"
3054,JOHN MCCRAE,religion had a part. He was principal of McGill. I am not saying that
3055,JOHN MCCRAE,all boys who entered that University were religious boys when they went
3056,JOHN MCCRAE,"in, or even religious men when they came out; but religious fathers had"
3057,JOHN MCCRAE,a general desire to place their boys under Sir William Dawson's care.
3058,JOHN MCCRAE,
3059,JOHN MCCRAE,"Those were the days of a queer, and now forgotten, controversy over"
3060,JOHN MCCRAE,"what was called ""Science and Religion"". Of that also I have written in"
3061,JOHN MCCRAE,another place. It was left to Sir William Dawson to deliver the last
3062,JOHN MCCRAE,word in defence of a cause that was already lost. His book came under
3063,JOHN MCCRAE,"the eye of David McCrae, as most books of the time did, and he was"
3064,JOHN MCCRAE,troubled in his heart. His boys were at the University of Toronto. It
3065,JOHN MCCRAE,was too late; but he eased his mind by writing a letter. To this letter
3066,JOHN MCCRAE,"John replies under date 20th December, 1890: ""You say that after reading"
3067,JOHN MCCRAE,"Dawson's book you almost regretted that we had not gone to McGill. That,"
3068,JOHN MCCRAE,"I consider, would have been rather a calamity, about as much so as going"
3069,JOHN MCCRAE,"to Queen's."" We are not always wiser than our fathers were, and in the"
3070,JOHN MCCRAE,end he came to McGill after all.
3071,JOHN MCCRAE,
3072,JOHN MCCRAE,"For good or ill, John McCrae entered the University of Toronto in 1888,"
3073,JOHN MCCRAE,"with a scholarship for ""general proficiency"". He joined the Faculty of"
3074,JOHN MCCRAE,"Arts, took the honours course in natural sciences, and graduated from"
3075,JOHN MCCRAE,"the department of biology in 1894, his course having been interrupted"
3076,JOHN MCCRAE,"by two severe illnesses. From natural science, it was an easy step to"
3077,JOHN MCCRAE,"medicine, in which he was encouraged by Ramsay Wright, A. B. Macallum,"
3078,JOHN MCCRAE,"A. McPhedran, and I. H. Cameron. In 1898 he graduated again, with a"
3079,JOHN MCCRAE,"gold medal, and a scholarship in physiology and pathology. The previous"
3080,JOHN MCCRAE,"summer he had spent at the Garrett Children's Hospital in Mt. Airy,"
3081,JOHN MCCRAE,Maryland.
3082,JOHN MCCRAE,
3083,JOHN MCCRAE,Upon graduating he entered the Toronto General Hospital as resident
3084,JOHN MCCRAE,house officer; in 1899 he occupied a similar post at Johns Hopkins. Then
3085,JOHN MCCRAE,he came to McGill University as fellow in pathology and pathologist to
3086,JOHN MCCRAE,the Montreal General Hospital. In time he was appointed physician to the
3087,JOHN MCCRAE,Alexandra Hospital for infectious diseases; later assistant physician to
3088,JOHN MCCRAE,"the Royal Victoria Hospital, and lecturer in medicine in the University."
3089,JOHN MCCRAE,"By examination he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians,"
3090,JOHN MCCRAE,London. In 1914 he was elected a member of the Association of American
3091,JOHN MCCRAE,Physicians. These are distinctions won by few in the profession.
3092,JOHN MCCRAE,
3093,JOHN MCCRAE,"In spite, or rather by reason, of his various attainments John McCrae"
3094,JOHN MCCRAE,"never developed, or degenerated, into the type of the pure scientist."
3095,JOHN MCCRAE,For the laboratory he had neither the mind nor the hands. He never
3096,JOHN MCCRAE,peered at partial truths so closely as to mistake them for the whole
3097,JOHN MCCRAE,"truth; therefore, he was unfitted for that purely scientific career"
3098,JOHN MCCRAE,which was developed to so high a pitch of perfection in that nation
3099,JOHN MCCRAE,"which is now no longer mentioned amongst men. He wrote much, and"
3100,JOHN MCCRAE,"often, upon medical problems. The papers bearing his name amount to"
3101,JOHN MCCRAE,thirty-three items in the catalogues. They testify to his industry
3102,JOHN MCCRAE,"rather than to invention and discovery, but they have made his name"
3103,JOHN MCCRAE,known in every text-book of medicine.
3104,JOHN MCCRAE,
3105,JOHN MCCRAE,"Apart from his verse, and letters, and diaries, and contributions to"
3106,JOHN MCCRAE,"journals and books of medicine, with an occasional address to students"
3107,JOHN MCCRAE,"or to societies, John McCrae left few writings, and in these there is"
3108,JOHN MCCRAE,nothing remarkable by reason of thought or expression. He could not
3109,JOHN MCCRAE,write prose. Fine as was his ear for verse he could not produce that
3110,JOHN MCCRAE,"finer rhythm of prose, which comes from the fall of proper words in"
3111,JOHN MCCRAE,proper sequence. He never learned that if a writer of prose takes care
3112,JOHN MCCRAE,of the sound the sense will take care of itself. He did not scrutinize
3113,JOHN MCCRAE,"words to discover their first and fresh meaning. He wrote in phrases,"
3114,JOHN MCCRAE,"and used words at second-hand as the journalists do. Bullets ""rained"";"
3115,JOHN MCCRAE,"guns ""swept""; shells ""hailed""; events ""transpired"", and yet his"
3116,JOHN MCCRAE,"appreciation of style in others was perfect, and he was an insatiable"
3117,JOHN MCCRAE,reader of the best books. His letters are strewn with names of authors
3118,JOHN MCCRAE,whose worth time has proved. To specify them would merely be to write
3119,JOHN MCCRAE,the catalogue of a good library.
3120,JOHN MCCRAE,
3121,JOHN MCCRAE,The thirteen years with which this century opened were the period in
3122,JOHN MCCRAE,which John McCrae established himself in civil life in Montreal and in
3123,JOHN MCCRAE,the profession of medicine. Of this period he has left a chronicle which
3124,JOHN MCCRAE,is at once too long and too short.
3125,JOHN MCCRAE,
3126,JOHN MCCRAE,All lives are equally interesting if only we are in possession of all
3127,JOHN MCCRAE,the facts. Places like Oxford and Cambridge have been made interesting
3128,JOHN MCCRAE,"because the people who live in them are in the habit of writing, and"
3129,JOHN MCCRAE,always write about each other. Family letters have little interest
3130,JOHN MCCRAE,"even for the family itself, if they consist merely of a recital of the"
3131,JOHN MCCRAE,trivial events of the day. They are prized for the unusual and for the
3132,JOHN MCCRAE,sentiment they contain. Diaries also are dull unless they deal with
3133,JOHN MCCRAE,selected incidents; and selection is the essence of every art. Few
3134,JOHN MCCRAE,"events have any interest in themselves, but any event can be made"
3135,JOHN MCCRAE,interesting by the pictorial or literary art.
3136,JOHN MCCRAE,
3137,JOHN MCCRAE,"When he writes to his mother, that, as he was coming out of the"
3138,JOHN MCCRAE,"college, an Irish setter pressed a cold nose against his hand, that is"
3139,JOHN MCCRAE,interesting because it is unusual. If he tells us that a professor took
3140,JOHN MCCRAE,"him by the arm, there is no interest in that to her or to any one else."
3141,JOHN MCCRAE,For that reason the ample letters and diaries which cover these years
3142,JOHN MCCRAE,"need not detain us long. There is in them little selection, little"
3143,JOHN MCCRAE,art--too much professor and too little dog.
3144,JOHN MCCRAE,
3145,JOHN MCCRAE,"It is, of course, the business of the essayist to select; but in the"
3146,JOHN MCCRAE,present case there is little to choose. He tells of invitations to
3147,JOHN MCCRAE,"dinner, accepted, evaded, or refused; but he does not always tell who"
3148,JOHN MCCRAE,"were there, what he thought of them, or what they had to eat. Dinner"
3149,JOHN MCCRAE,"at the Adami's,--supper at Ruttan's,--a night with Owen,--tea at the"
3150,JOHN MCCRAE,"Reford's,--theatre with the Hickson's,--a reception at the Angus's,--or"
3151,JOHN MCCRAE,"a dance at the Allan's,--these events would all be quite meaningless"
3152,JOHN MCCRAE,"without an exposition of the social life of Montreal, which is too large"
3153,JOHN MCCRAE,"a matter to undertake, alluring as the task would be. Even then, one"
3154,JOHN MCCRAE,would be giving one's own impressions and not his.
3155,JOHN MCCRAE,
3156,JOHN MCCRAE,Wherever he lived he was a social figure. When he sat at table the
3157,JOHN MCCRAE,dinner was never dull. The entertainment he offered was not missed by
3158,JOHN MCCRAE,"the dullest intelligence. His contribution was merely ""stories"", and"
3159,JOHN MCCRAE,these stories in endless succession were told in a spirit of frank fun.
3160,JOHN MCCRAE,"They were not illustrative, admonitory, or hortatory. They were just"
3161,JOHN MCCRAE,"amusing, and always fresh. This gift he acquired from his mother, who"
3162,JOHN MCCRAE,"had that rare charm of mimicry without mockery, and caricature without"
3163,JOHN MCCRAE,malice. In all his own letters there is not an unkind comment or tinge
3164,JOHN MCCRAE,"of ill-nature, although in places, especially in later years, there is"
3165,JOHN MCCRAE,bitter indignation against those Canadian patriots who were patriots
3166,JOHN MCCRAE,merely for their bellies' sake.
3167,JOHN MCCRAE,
3168,JOHN MCCRAE,Taken together his letters and diaries are a revelation of the heroic
3169,JOHN MCCRAE,struggle by which a man gains a footing in a strange place in that most
3170,JOHN MCCRAE,"particular of all professions, a struggle comprehended by those alone"
3171,JOHN MCCRAE,who have made the trial of it. And yet the method is simple. It is all
3172,JOHN MCCRAE,"disclosed in his words, ""I have never refused any work that was given me"
3173,JOHN MCCRAE,"to do."" These records are merely a chronicle of work. Outdoor clinics,"
3174,JOHN MCCRAE,"laboratory tasks, post-mortems, demonstrating, teaching, lecturing,"
3175,JOHN MCCRAE,"attendance upon the sick in wards and homes, meetings, conventions,"
3176,JOHN MCCRAE,"papers, addresses, editing, reviewing,--the very remembrance of such a"
3177,JOHN MCCRAE,career is enough to appall the stoutest heart.
3178,JOHN MCCRAE,
3179,JOHN MCCRAE,"But John McCrae was never appalled. He went about his work gaily, never"
3180,JOHN MCCRAE,"busy, never idle. Each minute was pressed into the service, and every"
3181,JOHN MCCRAE,hour was made to count. In the first eight months of practice he
3182,JOHN MCCRAE,claims to have made ninety dollars. It is many years before we hear him
3183,JOHN MCCRAE,"complain of the drudgery of sending out accounts, and sighing for the"
3184,JOHN MCCRAE,services of a bookkeeper. This is the only complaint that appears in his
3185,JOHN MCCRAE,letters.
3186,JOHN MCCRAE,
3187,JOHN MCCRAE,"There were at the time in Montreal two rival schools, and are yet two"
3188,JOHN MCCRAE,rival hospitals. But John McCrae was of no party. He was the friend of
3189,JOHN MCCRAE,"all men, and the confidant of many. He sought nothing for himself and by"
3190,JOHN MCCRAE,seeking not he found what he most desired. His mind was single and his
3191,JOHN MCCRAE,intention pure; his acts unsullied by selfish thought; his aim was true
3192,JOHN MCCRAE,because it was steady and high. His aid was never sought for any cause
3193,JOHN MCCRAE,"that was unworthy, and those humorous eyes could see through the bones"
3194,JOHN MCCRAE,"to the marrow of a scheme. In spite of his singular innocence, or rather"
3195,JOHN MCCRAE,"by reason of it, he was the last man in the world to be imposed upon."
3196,JOHN MCCRAE,
3197,JOHN MCCRAE,In all this devastating labour he never neglected the assembling of
3198,JOHN MCCRAE,"himself together with those who write and those who paint. Indeed, he"
3199,JOHN MCCRAE,had himself some small skill in line and colour. His hands were the
3200,JOHN MCCRAE,hands of an artist--too fine and small for a body that weighted 180
3201,JOHN MCCRAE,"pounds, and measured more than five feet eleven inches in height. There"
3202,JOHN MCCRAE,"was in Montreal an institution known as ""The Pen and Pencil Club"". No"
3203,JOHN MCCRAE,one now living remembers a time when it did not exist. It was a peculiar
3204,JOHN MCCRAE,club. It contained no member who should not be in it; and no one was
3205,JOHN MCCRAE,left out who should be in. The number was about a dozen. For twenty
3206,JOHN MCCRAE,"years the club met in Dyonnet's studio, and afterwards, as the result"
3207,JOHN MCCRAE,"of some convulsion, in K. R. Macpherson's. A ceremonial supper was eaten"
3208,JOHN MCCRAE,"once a year, at which one dressed the salad, one made the coffee, and"
3209,JOHN MCCRAE,"Harris sang a song. Here all pictures were first shown, and writings"
3210,JOHN MCCRAE,"read--if they were not too long. If they were, there was in an adjoining"
3211,JOHN MCCRAE,"room a tin chest, which in these austere days one remembers with"
3212,JOHN MCCRAE,"refreshment. When John McCrae was offered membership he ""grabbed at"
3213,JOHN MCCRAE,"it"", and the place was a home for the spirit wearied by the week's work."
3214,JOHN MCCRAE,"There Brymner and the other artists would discourse upon writings, and"
3215,JOHN MCCRAE,Burgess and the other writers would discourse upon pictures.
3216,JOHN MCCRAE,
3217,JOHN MCCRAE,"It is only with the greatest of resolution, fortified by lack of time"
3218,JOHN MCCRAE,"and space, that I have kept myself to the main lines of his career, and"
3219,JOHN MCCRAE,"refrained from following him into by-paths and secret, pleasant places;"
3220,JOHN MCCRAE,but I shall not be denied just one indulgence. In the great days when
3221,JOHN MCCRAE,Lord Grey was Governor-General he formed a party to visit Prince Edward
3222,JOHN MCCRAE,Island. The route was a circuitous one. It began at Ottawa; it extended
3223,JOHN MCCRAE,"to Winnipeg, down the Nelson River to York Factory, across Hudson Bay,"
3224,JOHN MCCRAE,"down the Strait, by Belle Isle and Newfoundland, and across the Gulf"
3225,JOHN MCCRAE,of St. Lawrence to a place called Orwell. Lord Grey in the matter of
3226,JOHN MCCRAE,company had the reputation of doing himself well. John McCrae was of the
3227,JOHN MCCRAE,"party. It also included John Macnaughton, L. S. Amery, Lord Percy, Lord"
3228,JOHN MCCRAE,"Lanesborough, and one or two others. The ship had called at North Sydney"
3229,JOHN MCCRAE,where Lady Grey and the Lady Evelyn joined.
3230,JOHN MCCRAE,
3231,JOHN MCCRAE,Through the place in a deep ravine runs an innocent stream which
3232,JOHN MCCRAE,"broadens out into still pools, dark under the alders. There was a rod--a"
3233,JOHN MCCRAE,very beautiful rod in two pieces. It excited his suspicion. It was put
3234,JOHN MCCRAE,"into his hand, the first stranger hand that ever held it; and the first"
3235,JOHN MCCRAE,cast showed that it was a worthy hand. The sea-trout were running that
3236,JOHN MCCRAE,"afternoon. Thirty years before, in that memorable visit to Scotland,"
3237,JOHN MCCRAE,"he had been taken aside by ""an old friend of his grandfather's"". It was"
3238,JOHN MCCRAE,"there he learned ""to love the trooties"". The love and the art never left"
3239,JOHN MCCRAE,him. It was at this same Orwell his brother first heard the world called
3240,JOHN MCCRAE,to arms on that early August morning in 1914.
3241,JOHN MCCRAE,
3242,JOHN MCCRAE,"In those civil years there were, of course, diversions: visits to the"
3243,JOHN MCCRAE,"United States and meetings with notable men--Welch, Futcher, Hurd,"
3244,JOHN MCCRAE,"White, Howard, Barker: voyages to Europe with a detailed itinerary upon"
3245,JOHN MCCRAE,the record; walks and rides upon the mountain; excursion in winter to
3246,JOHN MCCRAE,"the woods, and in summer to the lakes; and one visit to the Packards"
3247,JOHN MCCRAE,"in Maine, with the sea enthusiastically described. Upon those woodland"
3248,JOHN MCCRAE,excursions and upon many other adventures his companion is often
3249,JOHN MCCRAE,"referred to as ""Billy T."", who can be no other than Lieut.-Col. W. G."
3250,JOHN MCCRAE,"Turner, ""M.C."""
3251,JOHN MCCRAE,
3252,JOHN MCCRAE,Much is left out of the diary that we would wish to have recorded.
3253,JOHN MCCRAE,"There is tantalizing mention of ""conversations"" with Shepherd--with"
3254,JOHN MCCRAE,Roddick--with Chipman--with Armstrong--with Gardner--with Martin--with
3255,JOHN MCCRAE,"Moyse. Occasionally there is a note of description: ""James Mavor is a"
3256,JOHN MCCRAE,"kindly genius with much knowledge""; ""Tait McKenzie presided ideally"" at"
3257,JOHN MCCRAE,"a Shakespeare dinner; ""Stephen Leacock does not keep all the good things"
3258,JOHN MCCRAE,"for his publisher."" Those who know the life in Montreal may well for"
3259,JOHN MCCRAE,themselves supply the details.

3264,JOHN MCCRAE,IX. Dead in His Prime
3265,JOHN MCCRAE,
3266,JOHN MCCRAE,
3267,JOHN MCCRAE,"John McCrae left the front after the second battle of Ypres, and never"
3268,JOHN MCCRAE,"returned. On June 1st, 1915, he was posted to No. 3 General Hospital"
3269,JOHN MCCRAE,"at Boulogne, a most efficient unit organized by McGill University and"
3270,JOHN MCCRAE,"commanded by that fine soldier Colonel H. S. Birkett, C.B. He was placed"
3271,JOHN MCCRAE,"in charge of medicine, with the rank of Lieut.-Colonel as from April"
3272,JOHN MCCRAE,"17th, 1915, and there he remained until his death."
3273,JOHN MCCRAE,
3274,JOHN MCCRAE,At first he did not relish the change. His heart was with the guns. He
3275,JOHN MCCRAE,had transferred from the artillery to the medical service as recently
3276,JOHN MCCRAE,"as the previous autumn, and embarked a few days afterwards at Quebec,"
3277,JOHN MCCRAE,"on the 29th of September, arriving at Davenport, October 20th, 1914."
3278,JOHN MCCRAE,Although he was attached as Medical Officer to the 1st Brigade of
3279,JOHN MCCRAE,"Artillery, he could not forget that he was no longer a gunner, and in"
3280,JOHN MCCRAE,those tumultuous days he was often to be found in the observation post
3281,JOHN MCCRAE,rather than in his dressing station. He had inherited something of
3282,JOHN MCCRAE,"the old army superciliousness towards a ""non-combatant"" service, being"
3283,JOHN MCCRAE,unaware that in this war the battle casualties in the medical corps were
3284,JOHN MCCRAE,to be higher than in any other arm of the service. From South Africa he
3285,JOHN MCCRAE,"wrote exactly fifteen years before: ""I am glad that I am not 'a medical'"
3286,JOHN MCCRAE,out here. No 'R.A.M.C.' or any other 'M.C.' for me. There is a big
3287,JOHN MCCRAE,"breach, and the medicals are on the far side of it."" On August 7th,"
3288,JOHN MCCRAE,"1915, he writes from his hospital post, ""I expect to wish often that I"
3289,JOHN MCCRAE,"had stuck by the artillery."" But he had no choice."
3290,JOHN MCCRAE,
3291,JOHN MCCRAE,Of this period of his service there is little written record. He merely
3292,JOHN MCCRAE,"did his work, and did it well, as he always did what his mind found to"
3293,JOHN MCCRAE,do. His health was failing. He suffered from the cold. A year before his
3294,JOHN MCCRAE,"death he writes on January 25th, 1917:"
3295,JOHN MCCRAE,
3296,JOHN MCCRAE,
3297,JOHN MCCRAE,"The cruel cold is still holding. Everyone is suffering, and the men"
3298,JOHN MCCRAE,in the wards in bed cannot keep warm. I know of nothing so absolutely
3299,JOHN MCCRAE,pitiless as weather. Let one wish; let one pray; do what one will; still
3300,JOHN MCCRAE,"the same clear sky and no sign,--you know the cold brand of sunshine."
3301,JOHN MCCRAE,For my own part I do not think I have ever been more uncomfortable.
3302,JOHN MCCRAE,Everything is so cold that it hurts to pick it up. To go to bed is a
3303,JOHN MCCRAE,nightmare and to get up a worse one. I have heard of cold weather in
3304,JOHN MCCRAE,"Europe, and how the poor suffer,--now I know!"
3305,JOHN MCCRAE,
3306,JOHN MCCRAE,
3307,JOHN MCCRAE,All his life he was a victim of asthma. The first definite attack was
3308,JOHN MCCRAE,"in the autumn of 1894, and the following winter it recurred with"
3309,JOHN MCCRAE,persistence. For the next five years his letters abound in references
3310,JOHN MCCRAE,to the malady. After coming to Montreal it subsided; but he always felt
3311,JOHN MCCRAE,that the enemy was around the corner. He had frequent periods in bed;
3312,JOHN MCCRAE,but he enjoyed the relief from work and the occasion they afforded for
3313,JOHN MCCRAE,rest and reading.
3314,JOHN MCCRAE,
3315,JOHN MCCRAE,"In January, 1918, minutes begin to appear upon his official file"
3316,JOHN MCCRAE,"which were of great interest to him, and to us. Colonel Birkett had"
3317,JOHN MCCRAE,relinquished command of the unit to resume his duties as Dean of the
3318,JOHN MCCRAE,Medical Faculty of McGill University. He was succeeded by that veteran
3319,JOHN MCCRAE,"soldier, Colonel J. M. Elder, C.M.G. At the same time the command of No."
3320,JOHN MCCRAE,1 General Hospital fell vacant. Lieut.-Colonel McCrae was required
3321,JOHN MCCRAE,"for that post; but a higher honour was in store, namely the place of"
3322,JOHN MCCRAE,"Consultant to the British Armies in the Field. All these events, and"
3323,JOHN MCCRAE,"the final great event, are best recorded in the austere official"
3324,JOHN MCCRAE,correspondence which I am permitted to extract from the files:

3328,JOHN MCCRAE,"To O.C. No. 3 General Hospital, B.E.F., 13th December, 1917:"
3329,JOHN MCCRAE,There is a probability of the command of No. 1 General Hospital
3330,JOHN MCCRAE,"becoming vacant.  It is requested, please, that you obtain"
3331,JOHN MCCRAE,"from Lieut.-Col. J. McCrae his wishes in the matter.  If he is available,"
3332,JOHN MCCRAE,"and willing to take over this command, it is proposed to offer it to him."

3337,JOHN MCCRAE,while he naturally looks forward to succeeding to the command
3338,JOHN MCCRAE,"of this unit, he is quite willing to comply with your desire,"
3339,JOHN MCCRAE,and will take command of No. 1 General Hospital at any time you may wish.

3353,JOHN MCCRAE,for Lieut.-Colonel McCrae for this duty.  This is a much higher honour
3354,JOHN MCCRAE,"than commanding a General Hospital, and I hope he will take the post,"
3355,JOHN MCCRAE,as this is a position I have long wished should be filled
3356,JOHN MCCRAE,by a C.A.M.C. officer.

3377,JOHN MCCRAE,
3378,JOHN MCCRAE,
3379,JOHN MCCRAE,This was the end. For him the war was finished and all the glory of the
3380,JOHN MCCRAE,world had passed.
3381,JOHN MCCRAE,
3382,JOHN MCCRAE,"Henceforth we are concerned not with the letters he wrote, but with"
3383,JOHN MCCRAE,"the letters which were written about him. They came from all quarters,"
3384,JOHN MCCRAE,"literally in hundreds, all inspired by pure sympathy, but some tinged"
3385,JOHN MCCRAE,with a curiosity which it is hoped this writing will do something to
3386,JOHN MCCRAE,assuage.
3387,JOHN MCCRAE,
3388,JOHN MCCRAE,Let us first confine ourselves to the facts. They are all contained in a
3389,JOHN MCCRAE,letter which Colonel Elder wrote to myself in common with other friends.
3390,JOHN MCCRAE,"On Wednesday, January 23rd, he was as usual in the morning; but in the"
3391,JOHN MCCRAE,afternoon Colonel Elder found him asleep in his chair in the mess room.
3392,JOHN MCCRAE,"""I have a slight headache,"" he said. He went to his quarters. In"
3393,JOHN MCCRAE,"the evening he was worse, but had no increase of temperature, no"
3394,JOHN MCCRAE,acceleration of pulse or respiration. At this moment the order arrived
3395,JOHN MCCRAE,for him to proceed forthwith as Consulting Physician of the First Army.
3396,JOHN MCCRAE,"Colonel Elder writes, ""I read the order to him, and told him I should"
3397,JOHN MCCRAE,announce the contents at mess. He was very much pleased over the
3398,JOHN MCCRAE,"appointment. We discussed the matter at some length, and I took his"
3399,JOHN MCCRAE,"advice upon measures for carrying on the medical work of the unit."""
3400,JOHN MCCRAE,
3401,JOHN MCCRAE,"Next morning he was sleeping soundly, but later on he professed to be"
3402,JOHN MCCRAE,"much better. He had no fever, no cough, no pain. In the afternoon he"
3403,JOHN MCCRAE,"sent for Colonel Elder, and announced that he had pneumonia. There were"
3404,JOHN MCCRAE,no signs in the chest; but the microscope revealed certain organisms
3405,JOHN MCCRAE,which rather confirmed the diagnosis. The temperature was rising. Sir
3406,JOHN MCCRAE,"Bertrand Dawson was sent for. He came by evening from Wimereux, but he"
3407,JOHN MCCRAE,could discover no physical signs. In the night the temperature continued
3408,JOHN MCCRAE,"to rise, and he complained of headache. He was restless until the"
3409,JOHN MCCRAE,"morning, ""when he fell into a calm, untroubled sleep."""
3410,JOHN MCCRAE,
3411,JOHN MCCRAE,"Next morning, being Friday, he was removed by ambulance to No. 14"
3412,JOHN MCCRAE,General Hospital at Wimereux. In the evening news came that he was
3413,JOHN MCCRAE,"better; by the morning the report was good, a lowered temperature and"
3414,JOHN MCCRAE,normal pulse. In the afternoon the condition grew worse; there were
3415,JOHN MCCRAE,"signs of cerebral irritation with a rapid, irregular pulse; his mind was"
3416,JOHN MCCRAE,"quickly clouded. Early on Sunday morning the temperature dropped, and"
3417,JOHN MCCRAE,the heart grew weak; there was an intense sleepiness. During the day the
3418,JOHN MCCRAE,"sleep increased to coma, and all knew the end was near."
3419,JOHN MCCRAE,
3420,JOHN MCCRAE,"His friends had gathered. The choicest of the profession was there, but"
3421,JOHN MCCRAE,"they were helpless. He remained unconscious, and died at half past one"
3422,JOHN MCCRAE,on Monday morning. The cause of death was double pneumonia with massive
3423,JOHN MCCRAE,"cerebral infection. Colonel Elder's letter concludes: ""We packed his"
3424,JOHN MCCRAE,"effects in a large box, everything that we thought should go to his"
3425,JOHN MCCRAE,"people, and Gow took it with him to England to-day."" Walter Gow was his"
3426,JOHN MCCRAE,"cousin, a son of that Gow who sailed with the Eckfords from Glasgow"
3427,JOHN MCCRAE,in the 'Clutha'. At the time he was Deputy Minister in London of the
3428,JOHN MCCRAE,Overseas Military Forces of Canada. He had been sent for but arrived too
3429,JOHN MCCRAE,late;--all was so sudden.
3430,JOHN MCCRAE,
3431,JOHN MCCRAE,"The funeral was held on Tuesday afternoon, January 29th, at the cemetery"
3432,JOHN MCCRAE,in Wimereux. The burial was made with full military pomp. From the
3433,JOHN MCCRAE,"Canadian Corps came Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Currie, the"
3434,JOHN MCCRAE,"General Officer Commanding; Major-General E. W. B. Morrison, and"
3435,JOHN MCCRAE,"Brigadier-General W. O. H. Dodds, of the Artillery. Sir A. T. Sloggett,"
3436,JOHN MCCRAE,"the Director-General of Medical Services, and his Staff were waiting at"
3437,JOHN MCCRAE,"the grave. All Commanding Officers at the Base, and all Deputy Directors"
3438,JOHN MCCRAE,were there. There was also a deputation from the Harvard Unit headed by
3439,JOHN MCCRAE,Harvey Cushing.
3440,JOHN MCCRAE,
3441,JOHN MCCRAE,"Bonfire went first, led by two grooms, and decked in the regulation"
3442,JOHN MCCRAE,"white ribbon, not the least pathetic figure in the sad procession."
3443,JOHN MCCRAE,"A hundred nursing Sisters in caps and veils stood in line, and then"
3444,JOHN MCCRAE,"proceeded in ambulances to the cemetery, where they lined up again."
3445,JOHN MCCRAE,"Seventy-five of the personnel from the Hospital acted as escort, and six"
3446,JOHN MCCRAE,Sergeants bore the coffin from the gates to the grave. The firing party
3447,JOHN MCCRAE,"was in its place. Then followed the chief mourners, Colonel Elder and"
3448,JOHN MCCRAE,"Sir Bertrand Dawson; and in their due order, the rank and file of No."
3449,JOHN MCCRAE,3 with their officers; the rank and file of No. 14 with their officers;
3450,JOHN MCCRAE,"all officers from the Base, with Major-General Wilberforce and the"
3451,JOHN MCCRAE,Deputy Directors to complete.
3452,JOHN MCCRAE,
3453,JOHN MCCRAE,"It was a springtime day, and those who have passed all those winters in"
3454,JOHN MCCRAE,France and in Flanders will know how lovely the springtime may be. So
3455,JOHN MCCRAE,"we may leave him, ""on this sunny slope, facing the sunset and the"
3456,JOHN MCCRAE,"sea."" These are the words used by one of the nurses in a letter to a"
3457,JOHN MCCRAE,"friend,--those women from whom no heart is hid. She also adds: ""The"
3458,JOHN MCCRAE,nurses lamented that he became unconscious so quickly they could not
3459,JOHN MCCRAE,"tell him how much they cared. To the funeral all came as we did, because"
3460,JOHN MCCRAE,"we loved him so."""
3461,JOHN MCCRAE,
3462,JOHN MCCRAE,At first there was the hush of grief and the silence of sudden shock.
3463,JOHN MCCRAE,"Then there was an outbreak of eulogy, of appraisement, and sorrow. No"
3464,JOHN MCCRAE,attempt shall be made to reproduce it here; but one or two voices may
3465,JOHN MCCRAE,be recorded in so far as in disjointed words they speak for all. Stephen
3466,JOHN MCCRAE,"Leacock, for those who write, tells of his high vitality and splendid"
3467,JOHN MCCRAE,vigour--his career of honour and marked distinction--his life filled
3468,JOHN MCCRAE,with honourable endeavour and instinct with the sense of duty--a sane
3469,JOHN MCCRAE,"and equable temperament--whatever he did, filled with sure purpose and"
3470,JOHN MCCRAE,swift conviction.
3471,JOHN MCCRAE,
3472,JOHN MCCRAE,"Dr. A. D. Blackader, acting Dean of the Medical Faculty of McGill"
3473,JOHN MCCRAE,"University, himself speaking from out of the shadow, thus appraises his"
3474,JOHN MCCRAE,"worth: ""As a teacher, trusted and beloved; as a colleague, sincere and"
3475,JOHN MCCRAE,"cordial; as a physician, faithful, cheerful, kind. An unkind word he"
3476,JOHN MCCRAE,"never uttered."" Oskar Klotz, himself a student, testifies that the"
3477,JOHN MCCRAE,relationship was essentially one of master and pupil. From the head of
3478,JOHN MCCRAE,"his first department at McGill, Professor, now Colonel, Adami, comes the"
3479,JOHN MCCRAE,"weighty phrase, that he was sound in diagnosis; as a teacher inspiring;"
3480,JOHN MCCRAE,that few could rise to his high level of service.
3481,JOHN MCCRAE,
3482,JOHN MCCRAE,There is yet a deeper aspect of this character with which we are
3483,JOHN MCCRAE,"concerned; but I shrink from making the exposition, fearing lest with my"
3484,JOHN MCCRAE,heavy literary tread I might destroy more than I should discover. When
3485,JOHN MCCRAE,one stands by the holy place wherein dwells a dead friend's soul--the
3486,JOHN MCCRAE,word would slip out at last--it becomes him to take off the shoes from
3487,JOHN MCCRAE,off his feet. But fortunately the dilemma does not arise. The task
3488,JOHN MCCRAE,has already been performed by one who by God has been endowed with the
3489,JOHN MCCRAE,"religious sense, and by nature enriched with the gift of expression;"
3490,JOHN MCCRAE,one who in his high calling has long been acquainted with the grief
3491,JOHN MCCRAE,"of others, and is now himself a man of sorrow, having seen with"
3492,JOHN MCCRAE,"understanding eyes,"
3493,JOHN MCCRAE,
3494,JOHN MCCRAE,"These great days range like tides,"
3495,JOHN MCCRAE,And leave our dead on every shore.
3496,JOHN MCCRAE,
3497,JOHN MCCRAE,"On February 14th, 1918, a Memorial Service was held in the Royal"
3498,JOHN MCCRAE,Victoria College. Principal Sir William Peterson presided. John
3499,JOHN MCCRAE,"Macnaughton gave the address in his own lovely and inimitable words, to"
3500,JOHN MCCRAE,"commemorate one whom he lamented, ""so young and strong, in the prime of"
3501,JOHN MCCRAE,"life, in the full ripeness of his fine powers, his season of fruit and"
3502,JOHN MCCRAE,flower bearing. He never lost the simple faith of his childhood. He
3503,JOHN MCCRAE,"was so sure about the main things, the vast things, the indispensable"
3504,JOHN MCCRAE,"things, of which all formulated faiths are but a more or less stammering"
3505,JOHN MCCRAE,"expression, that he was content with the rough embodiment in which"
3506,JOHN MCCRAE,his ancestors had laboured to bring those great realities to bear as
3507,JOHN MCCRAE,beneficent and propulsive forces upon their own and their children's
3508,JOHN MCCRAE,"minds and consciences. His instinctive faith sufficed him."""
3509,JOHN MCCRAE,
3510,JOHN MCCRAE,"To his own students John McCrae once quoted the legend from a picture,"
3511,JOHN MCCRAE,"to him ""the most suggestive picture in the world"": What I spent I had:"
3512,JOHN MCCRAE,"what I saved I lost: what I gave I have;--and he added: ""It will be in"
3513,JOHN MCCRAE,your power every day to store up for yourselves treasures that will
3514,JOHN MCCRAE,"come back to you in the consciousness of duty well done, of kind acts"
3515,JOHN MCCRAE,"performed, things that having given away freely you yet possess. It has"
3516,JOHN MCCRAE,often seemed to me that when in the Judgement those surprised faces look
3517,JOHN MCCRAE,"up and say, Lord, when saw we Thee an' hungered and fed Thee; or thirsty"
3518,JOHN MCCRAE,"and gave Thee drink; a stranger, and took Thee in; naked and clothed"
3519,JOHN MCCRAE,"Thee; and there meets them that warrant-royal of all charity, Inasmuch"
3520,JOHN MCCRAE,"as ye did it unto one of the least of these, ye have done it unto Me,"
3521,JOHN MCCRAE,"there will be amongst those awed ones many a practitioner of medicine."""
3522,JOHN MCCRAE,
3523,JOHN MCCRAE,And finally I shall conclude this task to which I have set a worn but
3524,JOHN MCCRAE,"willing hand, by using again the words which once I used before: Beyond"
3525,JOHN MCCRAE,all consideration of his intellectual attainments John McCrae was
3526,JOHN MCCRAE,the well beloved of his friends. He will be missed in his place; and
3527,JOHN MCCRAE,wherever his companions assemble there will be for them a new poignancy
3528,JOHN MCCRAE,"in the Miltonic phrase,"
3529,JOHN MCCRAE,
3530,JOHN MCCRAE,"But O the heavy change, now thou art gone,"
3531,JOHN MCCRAE,"Now thou art gone, and never must return!"
