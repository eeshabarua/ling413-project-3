79,INDIAN SUMMER,
80,INDIAN SUMMER,
81,INDIAN SUMMER,Fair are fleets of white winged prows
82,INDIAN SUMMER,Swiftly sailing o’er the sea;
83,INDIAN SUMMER,"Fair are herds of homing cows,"
84,INDIAN SUMMER,Winding slowly o’er the lea;
85,INDIAN SUMMER,"Fair are orchards, when replete"
86,INDIAN SUMMER,With rich blossoms pink and white;
87,INDIAN SUMMER,Fair are fields of ripening wheat
88,INDIAN SUMMER,Shining in the morning light;
89,INDIAN SUMMER,Fair is any mountain sheet
90,INDIAN SUMMER,Burnishing in colors bright;
91,INDIAN SUMMER,
92,INDIAN SUMMER,Fair are all Acadia’s lands;
93,INDIAN SUMMER,"All its streams and wooded lakes,"
94,INDIAN SUMMER,"Headlands high and pebbly strands,"
95,INDIAN SUMMER,"When the early morning breaks,"
96,INDIAN SUMMER,"Fair its scented flowers and trees,"
97,INDIAN SUMMER,"And its many landlocked bays,"
98,INDIAN SUMMER,Rippling in the summer breeze;
99,INDIAN SUMMER,Themes for minstrel muses’ lays--
100,INDIAN SUMMER,But far fairer than all these
101,INDIAN SUMMER,Are Acadia’s autumn days.
102,INDIAN SUMMER,
103,INDIAN SUMMER,Made from heavenly design
104,INDIAN SUMMER,By some unseen Artisan;
105,INDIAN SUMMER,"Gift of Architect divine,"
106,INDIAN SUMMER,To Acadia’s Weather man.
107,INDIAN SUMMER,"Fairest season of the year,"
108,INDIAN SUMMER,When boon Nature’s at her height
109,INDIAN SUMMER,"Robed in all her beauty sere,"
110,INDIAN SUMMER,And fair Luna sheds her light
111,INDIAN SUMMER,With a more bewitching cheer
112,INDIAN SUMMER,Through the watches of the night.
113,INDIAN SUMMER,
114,INDIAN SUMMER,"And God’s lowly creatures all,"
115,INDIAN SUMMER,"Who the freeman’s burden bore,"
116,INDIAN SUMMER,Having heeded labor’s call
117,INDIAN SUMMER,"Now have plentitude in store,"
118,INDIAN SUMMER,And from every household hearth
119,INDIAN SUMMER,Nightly offered up the “word”.
120,INDIAN SUMMER,As a sacrifice of worth
121,INDIAN SUMMER,To a kind and gracious Lord
122,INDIAN SUMMER,"For the riches of the earth,"
123,INDIAN SUMMER,Filling thus the family board.
124,INDIAN SUMMER,
125,INDIAN SUMMER,And a thrill of peaceful joy
126,INDIAN SUMMER,Permeates the human breast
127,INDIAN SUMMER,And the starry vaulted sky
128,INDIAN SUMMER,"Seemingly is at its best,"
129,INDIAN SUMMER,For old Sol in all his pride
130,INDIAN SUMMER,"Scorpion doth then adorn,"
131,INDIAN SUMMER,Midway in his yearly ride
132,INDIAN SUMMER,’Twixt the Line and Capricorn.
133,INDIAN SUMMER,In this lovely Autumntide
134,INDIAN SUMMER,Was Waegwoltic’s wedding morn.

159,MOTHER LOVE,Blest and wondrous gift divine
160,MOTHER LOVE,Of the master Artisan
161,MOTHER LOVE,In fair Eden’s holy shrine

174,PETOOBOK,"Of Petoobok and of its golden sea,"
175,PETOOBOK,The fairest gem of Nature’s fashioning
176,PETOOBOK,"The beauty spot of beauteous Acadie,"
177,PETOOBOK,Its summer and its winter scenes I sing:
178,PETOOBOK,Here in primeval days great Neptune wise
179,PETOOBOK,"Conspired with Fora, bounteous and free,"
180,PETOOBOK,"To make a masterpiece, a paradise,"
181,PETOOBOK,Where Nymphs and Naiad’s might forever woo;
182,PETOOBOK,And now by night and day it ever lies
183,PETOOBOK,"Reflecting in its waters, deep and blue"
184,PETOOBOK,The heavenly wonders of the vaulted skies.
185,PETOOBOK,
186,PETOOBOK,"In splendour, wild and picturesque and grand,"
187,PETOOBOK,Beneath its sentinel hills like crystal set
188,PETOOBOK,With rarest taste by God and Nature’s hand.
189,PETOOBOK,It mirrors in its depth the silhouette
190,PETOOBOK,"Of mountains, which, like heroes of romance,"
191,PETOOBOK,"Along its lovely shores forever stand,"
192,PETOOBOK,"To guard the waters of its vast expanse,"
193,PETOOBOK,And holds to-day the same bewitching charm
194,PETOOBOK,"Of loveliness divine, you to entrance,"
195,PETOOBOK,"As on the morn the cry of Golden Arm,"
196,PETOOBOK,Burst from the lips of sons of sunny France.
197,PETOOBOK,
198,PETOOBOK,"Lake Petoobok, on summer afternoon"
199,PETOOBOK,"Looks fair and lovely to the mortal gaze,"
200,PETOOBOK,"And lovely too, what time the hunter’s moon"
201,PETOOBOK,"Illuminates it with her bewitching rays,"
202,PETOOBOK,As it lies sleeping ’neath its guardian hills
203,PETOOBOK,"By Flora robed in beauty, rare and boon,"
204,PETOOBOK,With foliage of variegated frills
205,PETOOBOK,On which the dancing beams like fairies glint
206,PETOOBOK,And from Dame Nature’s ample store distils
207,PETOOBOK,Those dyes of one and thousand autumn tints
208,PETOOBOK,Wrought by some magic hand in fairy mills.
209,PETOOBOK,
210,PETOOBOK,But Petoobok is fairest to behold
211,PETOOBOK,"On Autumn morn, when orient Sunlight breaks"
212,PETOOBOK,"In radiant glory on its arm of gold,"
213,PETOOBOK,"And gentle noosuk[A] into the ripples shakes,"
214,PETOOBOK,"The placid surface of its crystal sea,"
215,PETOOBOK,"And to the eye a vista doth unfold,"
216,PETOOBOK,"A wondrous scene of heavenly alchemy,"
217,PETOOBOK,"Like that told us by John in Holy Writ,"
218,PETOOBOK,"Which fills the soul with perfect ecstasy,"
219,PETOOBOK,"And which once seen, though time be preterit"
220,PETOOBOK,In after life in dreams you’ll ever see.

233,LANGEMARC,"In Langemarc’s blood-stained mead,"
234,LANGEMARC,Your glorious act will ever rank
235,LANGEMARC,"A truly golden deed,"
236,LANGEMARC,Sleep on with France and Briton
237,LANGEMARC,"And Belgian, side by side,"

243,LANGEMARC,Your lowly grave with kindly dews
244,LANGEMARC,While weeping willows wave;
245,LANGEMARC,"And kindly zephyrs every day,"
246,LANGEMARC,"And every night will sigh,"
247,LANGEMARC,"A sweet memoriam for aye,"
248,LANGEMARC,Your tomb to sanctify.
249,LANGEMARC,
250,LANGEMARC,"And Belgian maids and matrons, too"
251,LANGEMARC,Will often leave the loom
252,LANGEMARC,"To gather wilding flowers,"
253,LANGEMARC,To beautify your tomb;
254,LANGEMARC,"And peasants when they pass your way,"
255,LANGEMARC,Oft to their sons will say:
256,LANGEMARC,“’Twas here the brave Canadians
257,LANGEMARC,The fierce Huns held at bay.”
258,LANGEMARC,
259,LANGEMARC,"And when the Angel Gabriel,"
260,LANGEMARC,"Shall sound the trumpet blast,"
261,LANGEMARC,Then you shall all awaken
262,LANGEMARC,"From your seeming death at last,"
263,LANGEMARC,"And, standing at attention,"
264,LANGEMARC,"While angel voices sing,"
265,LANGEMARC,"In unison you will salute,"
266,LANGEMARC,The universal King.

278,EDITH CAVELL,Against the Hun who thy death sentence signed;

1027,COURCELLETTE.,"All the hills for miles around,"
1028,COURCELLETTE.,"Through which, like a thread of silver,"

1030,COURCELLETTE.,
1031,COURCELLETTE.,There were Saxons and Bavarians
1032,COURCELLETTE.,"In the Hun’s embattled host,"
1033,COURCELLETTE.,And the fierce and bloody Uhlans

1043,COURCELLETTE.,To make ready for the fray;
1044,COURCELLETTE.,And they sprang up from their trenches
1045,COURCELLETTE.,"Like the wild lynx with a bound,"
1046,COURCELLETTE.,And they rushed without a falter
1047,COURCELLETTE.,Right across the barrage ground;
1048,COURCELLETTE.,
1049,COURCELLETTE.,And they fell upon the Germans
1050,COURCELLETTE.,"Like an avalanche of hail,"
1051,COURCELLETTE.,And the Teutons bent before them
1052,COURCELLETTE.,Like the grain before the gale.
1053,COURCELLETTE.,And with irresisting fury
1054,COURCELLETTE.,"They assailed the faltering Hun,"
1055,COURCELLETTE.,And before the day was over

1062,COURCELLETTE.,"How at Courcellette’s fierce battle,"
1063,COURCELLETTE.,An undying name was made

1077,VIMY RIDGE.,Which told the boys in khaki
1078,VIMY RIDGE.,"Of fighting near at hand,"
1079,VIMY RIDGE.,And eagerly all waited
1080,VIMY RIDGE.,The long wished for command.
1081,VIMY RIDGE.,
1082,VIMY RIDGE.,"Within the first line trenches,"
1083,VIMY RIDGE.,"The highland laddies lay,"

1106,VIMY RIDGE.,"With cannon and with mortar,"
1107,VIMY RIDGE.,On concrete bases laid.
1108,VIMY RIDGE.,
1109,VIMY RIDGE.,"And thousands of machine guns,"

1111,VIMY RIDGE.,"And thousands of their snipers,"
1112,VIMY RIDGE.,With rifle and with brace;
1113,VIMY RIDGE.,And lines of barbed wire fencing
1114,VIMY RIDGE.,"Of every strength and size,"
1115,VIMY RIDGE.,And aught else which their science

1117,VIMY RIDGE.,
1118,VIMY RIDGE.,"Their seeming sense of safety,"
1119,VIMY RIDGE.,"The Teutons did elate,"
1120,VIMY RIDGE.,And all were glibly chanting

1122,VIMY RIDGE.,"When, lo! the pibroch’s skirling"

1125,VIMY RIDGE.,Came on them with a bound.
1126,VIMY RIDGE.,
1127,VIMY RIDGE.,And ere they had recovered
1128,VIMY RIDGE.,From their astonishment
1129,VIMY RIDGE.,The foremost of their gleemen
1130,VIMY RIDGE.,To sing elsewhere were sent;
1131,VIMY RIDGE.,And midst the cry of Kam’rade
1132,VIMY RIDGE.,"In broken English spoke,"
1133,VIMY RIDGE.,Both Prussian and Bavarian
1134,VIMY RIDGE.,Went down from bayonet stroke.
1135,VIMY RIDGE.,
1136,VIMY RIDGE.,"And furious was the struggle,"
1137,VIMY RIDGE.,"’Twixt Highlander and Hun,"
1138,VIMY RIDGE.,For hand to hand the fighting
1139,VIMY RIDGE.,On Vimy Ridge was done.
