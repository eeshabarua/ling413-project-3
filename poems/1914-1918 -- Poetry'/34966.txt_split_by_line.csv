114,THE CHOOSERS,"O ye! Fragile, tremulous"
115,THE CHOOSERS,"Haunters of the deep glades,"
116,THE CHOOSERS,Whose fingers part the leaves
117,THE CHOOSERS,"Of beech and aspen ere ye slip thro',"
118,THE CHOOSERS,Shall I see ye again?
119,THE CHOOSERS,
120,THE CHOOSERS,Men have said unto me:
121,THE CHOOSERS,"These are but flying lights and shadows,"
122,THE CHOOSERS,"Light on the beech-boles, clouds shadowing the corn-fields,"
123,THE CHOOSERS,"The wind in the flame of birches in autumn,"
124,THE CHOOSERS,Wind shadowing the clear pools.
125,THE CHOOSERS,"But ye cried, laughing, down the wind:"
126,THE CHOOSERS,"_Men are but shadows, but a vain breath!_"
127,THE CHOOSERS,
128,THE CHOOSERS,So here cometh unto me
129,THE CHOOSERS,That cry from the rejoicing air:
130,THE CHOOSERS,Men are but shadows! And prone about me
131,THE CHOOSERS,"I see them, hushed and sleeping in the hut,"
132,THE CHOOSERS,"Made solemn and holy by the night,"
133,THE CHOOSERS,In the dead light o' the moon:
134,THE CHOOSERS,"Shadowy, swathed in their blankets,"
135,THE CHOOSERS,"As sleep, in hewn sepulchral caves,"
136,THE CHOOSERS,Egypt's and Asia's kings.
137,THE CHOOSERS,While between them are the footsteps
138,THE CHOOSERS,"Of glittering presences, who say: Lo, one"
139,THE CHOOSERS,To be a sword upon my thigh!
140,THE CHOOSERS,And the sleepers stir restlessly and murmur
141,THE CHOOSERS,As between them pass
142,THE CHOOSERS,The bright-mailed choosers of the dead.
143,THE CHOOSERS,
144,THE CHOOSERS,"Shall I see ye again, O flying feet"
145,THE CHOOSERS,"O' the forest-haunters, while I couch silent,"
146,THE CHOOSERS,"In a wet brake o' blossom,"
147,THE CHOOSERS,Dark ivy wreathing your whiteness;
148,THE CHOOSERS,Ere I am torn from the scabbard:
149,THE CHOOSERS,"(Lo, one"
150,THE CHOOSERS,To be a sword upon my thigh!)
151,THE CHOOSERS,Knowing no longer that earth

168,SACRIFICE,"Burnished breast-plates, scarlet banners and trumpets"
169,SACRIFICE,Sounding exultantly.
170,SACRIFICE,"But the mean things of the earth hast thou chosen,"
171,SACRIFICE,"Decked them with suffering,"
172,SACRIFICE,"Made them beautiful with the passion for rightness,"
173,SACRIFICE,Strong with the pride of love.
174,SACRIFICE,
175,SACRIFICE,"Yea, tho' our praise of thee slayeth us,"
176,SACRIFICE,"Yet love shall exalt us beside thee triumphant,"
177,SACRIFICE,"Dying, that these live:"
178,SACRIFICE,"And the earth again be beautiful with orchards,"
179,SACRIFICE,"Yellow with wheatfields,"
180,SACRIFICE,"And the lips of others praise thee, tho' our lips"
181,SACRIFICE,"Be stopped with earth, and songless."
182,SACRIFICE,
183,SACRIFICE,"But we shall have brought thee their praises,"
184,SACRIFICE,Brought unto thee the perfect prayer:
185,SACRIFICE,"For the lips of no man uttereth love,"
186,SACRIFICE,Suffering even for love's sake.
187,SACRIFICE,
188,SACRIFICE,"O God of sorrows,"

190,SACRIFICE,"Stoop thou unto us,"
191,SACRIFICE,"For we die so thou livest,"
192,SACRIFICE,Our hearts the cups of thy vintage:
193,SACRIFICE,"And the lips of no man uttereth love,"
194,SACRIFICE,Suffering even for love's sake.

1132,THE MOCKING SONG,And my heart hath gathered honey of many dreams.
1133,THE MOCKING SONG,

1150,THE MOCKING SONG,"What have ye, O wise ones? The corn ye reaped ye shall sow,"
1151,THE MOCKING SONG,Ye shall watch for rains and tempests;
1152,THE MOCKING SONG,Only I hearing the hail on the roofs shall be gladdened.
1153,THE MOCKING SONG,
1154,THE MOCKING SONG,"Ye, being mockers, said: What profiteth him his singing?"

1160,THE MOCKING SONG,"Though ye be rich in this wise, yet are ye desolate."
1161,THE MOCKING SONG,
1162,THE MOCKING SONG,"I have gleaned in the hedgerows and wild glades of the forest,"
1163,THE MOCKING SONG,And that sweetness sufficeth to me:
1164,THE MOCKING SONG,For sweet it is to feel the rain upon face and hair.
1165,THE MOCKING SONG,
1166,THE MOCKING SONG,Surely ye have this day: but the wise sweetness in my heart
1167,THE MOCKING SONG,Is the honey of all days which ye have not.
1168,THE MOCKING SONG,"So shall my soul mock you, when dying, lo! ye are empty."
1169,THE MOCKING SONG,
1170,THE MOCKING SONG,"Even so when I hungered ye gave me bread,"
