51,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,
52,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,
53,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"William Marion Reedy,"
54,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,St. Louis Mirror:
55,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,
56,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,I will drop the mask and tell you the secret of my verses. You say they
57,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,impress you as being uneven and unfinished. I heartily agree with you.
58,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"As I have stated in my announcement to the public, a poem of the scope"
59,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"and range of “My Rubaiyat” is never complete. No doubt, it will undergo"
60,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,many changes within the next ten years. I say ten years deliberately.
61,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"You see, I possess the arrogance of conviction. I believe it will"
62,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"survive, simply because it strikes a popular chord, and attempts, no"
63,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"matter how vaguely, to reproduce a broken melody that hums in every"
64,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,mind. Somebody else may venture forth on similar paths and succeed to
65,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,please even the fastidious in rhyme. “My Rubaiyat” may be put on the
66,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"back shelves. Well, we will see. I look at my work with objective eyes."
67,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,It is a mere youngster now. It will grow and nobody will watch its
68,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,growth with keener appreciation than I myself. The number of verses will
69,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"not increase, but I sincerely hope that they will gain in clarity and"
70,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,strength as well as in musical and pictorial wealth of expression.
71,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,
72,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"As for versification, let me make this explanation. I chose the eight"
73,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,syllable stanza on account of its terseness of expression. It is least
74,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"pliable to any rush and swing of rhythm, but most conducive to the"
75,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,conveyance of fragmentary moods and thoughts. The omission of rhyme I
76,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,essayed for no other reason than its technical difficulty. To make
77,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,rhymeless lines read like a poem is the most laborious task a songsmith
78,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,can set himself. It is the vanity of the alien to show his mastery over
79,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,a language that was neither his father’s nor his mother’s tongue. But I
80,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,object to your statement that I disdain rhythm. I have a vague suspicion
81,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,that you really mean meter. My meter is rough and wilful and subject to
82,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"impurities, as for instance counting the last two syllables in words"
83,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"like “happier” and “sunnier” either as one or two, just as my fancy, or"
84,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"rather my appreciation of rhythm, dictates. My rhythm changes constantly"
85,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"but it is palpable, underneath as it were, at all times. I have some"
86,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,experience as a reader (though elocutionists may shrug their shoulders
87,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"at my style of interpretation—let them shrug) and I have, whenever I"
88,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"write, the habit of reading aloud the words as I put them down. Reading"
89,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"means to get a certain sense and swing, color and sound in the words as"
90,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,one utters them. If my verses contain this possibility of aural
91,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,gratification they cannot be utterly devoid of rhythm. No doubt my sense
92,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"of sound alliteration is foreign, unconsciously Oriental. I feel a sound"
93,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"relation, no, even a rhyme suggestion in words like “chance” and"
94,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"“spring,” “herd” and “feet” at the end of succeeding stanzas. The"
95,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,alliteration of Japanese poets is much subtler (due to the peculiarities
96,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"of the language) than the word music of our Laniers and Whitmans,"
97,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,although it is never conducted with the elaborate precision of a Poe or
98,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"Swinburne. It always remains fragmentary, it rarely resembles full"
99,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,orchestration. Also my lines lack the merit of contrapuntal structure.
100,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,Yet they have one quality which is generally overlooked. They possess
101,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,pictorial harmony. My long and persistent association with art makes me
102,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,not only see but think things in pictures. Pictures abound throughout
103,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,“My Rubaiyat” for all who have the mental pictorial vision to see them.
104,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,Lines like “turn phantoms with the colder morn” and “in a hilltown among
105,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,roses” are as concentrated as any image that can be found in a _tanka_
106,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,(i.e. Japanese short poem).
107,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,
108,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"Critics may contend that pictorial suggestion _per se_, as the main"
109,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"characteristic of a poem, does not conform to the accepted forms of"
110,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,poetry. This objection is meaningless to me. Without the spirit of
111,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,innovation there would have been no incentive to write the poem. Like
112,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,the composers of the day I believe in the old ideals but in new methods
113,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,of expression.
114,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,
115,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,My ambition was to write a simple poem which would appeal to all; to
116,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"chambermaids as well as cognoscenti, ordinary business men as well as"
117,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,solitary artistic souls. Who will decide whether I have succeeded or
118,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"failed? Only the public at large. The poem, no doubt, is too didactic"
119,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"for fragile aesthetics who glorify naught but evanescent words, but it"
120,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,is surely no shortcoming to try to express thought. Even exponents of
121,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,the modern schools attempt this—occasionally. The way of expression is a
122,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,different matter. It is open to criticism. But excuses that a critic
123,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"knows nothing about a certain subject, and yet at the same time"
124,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,deliberate pricks at this very thorn in the flesh of his ignorance are
125,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,sad to contemplate. Rhyme is surely out of date. And the supposed lack
126,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,of rhythm is merely imaginary. Would you enjoy Japanese or Chinese
127,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,music? Very likely not and yet they contain as fine a rhythm and as
128,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"musical a quality as any modern composition. Only they are vaguer,"
129,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"subtle, different."
130,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,
131,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,And on this difference hinges all logical and evasive argument. The
132,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"practical philosophy contained in “My Rubaiyat,” of course, can be"
133,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"attacked for being non-moral or non-religious, but the technique of the"
134,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,poem can be discussed only from one viewpoint.
135,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,
136,INSTEAD OF A PREFACE:,"Sincerely yours,"

200,VI.,Was man once happier than now?

390,XXV.,"The circle widens, travels farther,"
391,XXV.,With each emotion keenly felt
392,XXV.,Onward it pushes ’cross the waves

422,XXVIII.,"Imagination, sluggish thing,"
423,XXVIII.,"Will not obey the gayer moods,"
