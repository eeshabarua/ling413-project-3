240,INDEX,_The Passing Throng_
241,INDEX,
242,INDEX,From newsboy to the millionaire
243,INDEX,The passing throng goes by each day;
244,INDEX,"The old man with his weight of care,"
245,INDEX,"The maiden in her colors gay,"
246,INDEX,"The mother with her babe in arms,"
247,INDEX,"The dreamer and the man of might,"
248,INDEX,Grief's cruel scars and laughter's charms
249,INDEX,"Pass by the window, day and night."
250,INDEX,
251,INDEX,Now slowly rides a corpse to find
252,INDEX,"The grave and its unbroken sleep,"
253,INDEX,And in the carriages behind
254,INDEX,A score of sorrowing loved ones weep;
255,INDEX,But scarcely has the hearse passed by
256,INDEX,"Upon its journey to the tomb,"
257,INDEX,"When, wreathed with smiles of love, we spy"
258,INDEX,The faces of a bride and groom.
259,INDEX,
260,INDEX,"We cannot understand it all,"
261,INDEX,We cannot know why this is so;
262,INDEX,"From dawn until night's curtains fall,"
263,INDEX,We see the people come and go.
264,INDEX,"Hope lights the eyes of youth to-day,"
265,INDEX,To-morrow care has left them dim;
266,INDEX,"Once this man proudly walked his way,"
267,INDEX,But now defeat has broken him.
268,INDEX,
269,INDEX,"Could we but watch, as God must do,"
270,INDEX,"We'd see the struggling youth arise,"
271,INDEX,"We'd see him brave his dangers through,"
272,INDEX,And reach his goal and claim the prize.
273,INDEX,And we might judge with gentler sight
274,INDEX,"The broken lives, which come and go,"
275,INDEX,And better choose 'twixt wrong and right--
276,INDEX,If we could know what God must know.
277,INDEX,
278,INDEX,
279,INDEX,
280,INDEX,
281,INDEX,_Wife o' Mine_
282,INDEX,
283,INDEX,"Wife o' Mine, day after day"
284,INDEX,Cheering me along the way;
285,INDEX,"Patient, tender, smiling, true,"
286,INDEX,Always ready to renew
287,INDEX,Faltering courage and to share
288,INDEX,All the day may bring of care;
289,INDEX,Dreaming dreams wherein you see
290,INDEX,Brighter years that are to be;
291,INDEX,Calling paltry pleasures fine--
292,INDEX,"That's you always, Wife o' Mine."
293,INDEX,
294,INDEX,"Wife o' Mine, we've shed some tears"
295,INDEX,"With the passing of the years,"
296,INDEX,Mourned beside our lovely dead;
297,INDEX,But somehow you've always said
298,INDEX,You and I could bear the blow
299,INDEX,Knowing God had willed it so;
300,INDEX,And you've smiled to show to me
301,INDEX,"Just how brave you meant to be,"
302,INDEX,Smiled to keep my faith in line--
303,INDEX,"That's you, always, Wife o' Mine."
304,INDEX,
305,INDEX,"Wife o' Mine, long years ago"
306,INDEX,Once I promised you would know
307,INDEX,"Luxuries and costly things,"
308,INDEX,"Gowns of silk and jeweled rings,"
309,INDEX,And you laughed as though you knew
310,INDEX,Dreams like that could not come true;
311,INDEX,"Now perhaps they never will,"
312,INDEX,"But I see you laughing still,"
313,INDEX,Welcoming me with eyes that shine--
314,INDEX,"That's you always, Wife o' Mine."
315,INDEX,
316,INDEX,
317,INDEX,
318,INDEX,
319,INDEX,_Let's Be Brave_
320,INDEX,
321,INDEX,Let's be brave when the laughter dies
322,INDEX,"And the tears come into our troubled eyes,"
323,INDEX,Let's cling to the faith and the old belief
324,INDEX,"When the skies grow gray with the clouds of grief,"
325,INDEX,Let's bear the sorrow and hurt and pain
326,INDEX,And wait till the laughter comes again.
327,INDEX,
328,INDEX,Let's be brave when the trials come
329,INDEX,"And our hearts are sad and our lips are dumb,"
330,INDEX,Let's strengthen ourselves in the times of test
331,INDEX,By whispering softly that God knows best;
332,INDEX,"Let us still believe, though we cannot know,"
333,INDEX,We shall learn sometime it is better so.
334,INDEX,
335,INDEX,Let's be brave when the joy departs
336,INDEX,"Till peace shall come to our troubled hearts,"
337,INDEX,For the tears must fall and the rain come down
338,INDEX,And each brow be pressed to the thorny crown;
339,INDEX,"Yet after the dark shall the sun arise,"
340,INDEX,So let's be brave when the laughter dies.

345,INDEX,_Boy or Girl?_
346,INDEX,
347,INDEX,"Some folks pray for a boy, and some"
348,INDEX,For a golden-haired little girl to come.
349,INDEX,Some claim to think there is more of joy
350,INDEX,"Wrapped up in the smile of a little boy,"
351,INDEX,While others pretend that the silky curls
352,INDEX,"And plump, pink cheeks of the little girls"
353,INDEX,Bring more of bliss to the old home place
354,INDEX,Than a small boy's queer little freckled face.
355,INDEX,
356,INDEX,"Now which is better, I couldn't say"
357,INDEX,If the Lord should ask me to choose to-day;
358,INDEX,If He should put in a call for me
359,INDEX,"And say: ""Now what shall your order be,"
360,INDEX,A boy or girl?  I have both in store--
361,INDEX,"Which of the two are you waiting for?"""
362,INDEX,I'd say with one of my broadest grins:
363,INDEX,"""Send either one, if it can't be twins."""
364,INDEX,
365,INDEX,"I've heard it said, to some people's shame,"
366,INDEX,"They cried with grief when a small boy came,"
367,INDEX,For they wanted a girl.  And some folks I know
368,INDEX,"Who wanted a boy, just took on so"
369,INDEX,When a girl was sent.  But it seems to me
370,INDEX,That mothers and fathers should happy be
371,INDEX,"To think, when the Stork has come and gone,"
372,INDEX,That the Lord would trust them with either one.
373,INDEX,
374,INDEX,Boy or girl?  There can be no choice;
375,INDEX,There's something lovely in either voice.
376,INDEX,And all that I ask of the Lord to do
377,INDEX,Is to see that the mother comes safely through
378,INDEX,"And guard the baby and have it well,"
379,INDEX,"With a perfect form and a healthy yell,"
380,INDEX,And a pair of eyes and a shock of hair.
381,INDEX,"Then, boy or girl--and its dad won't care."
382,INDEX,
383,INDEX,
384,INDEX,
385,INDEX,
386,INDEX,_They're Waiting Over There_
387,INDEX,
388,INDEX,They're waiting for us over there;
389,INDEX,"The young, the beautiful and fair"
390,INDEX,"Who left us, oh, so long ago,"
391,INDEX,"Lonely and hurt on earth below,"
392,INDEX,"Are waiting bravely, never fear,"
393,INDEX,Until our faces shall appear.
394,INDEX,
395,INDEX,"Then, when our journey here is done,"
396,INDEX,And we set out to follow on
397,INDEX,"Through the great, heavy mantled door"
398,INDEX,"Which leads to rest forevermore,"
399,INDEX,They will be there to laugh away
400,INDEX,The loneliness we feel to-day.
401,INDEX,
402,INDEX,"They'll welcome us with wondrous grace,"
403,INDEX,And show us all about the place;
404,INDEX,They'll take us gently by the hand
405,INDEX,And guide us through that radiant land;
406,INDEX,They'll tell us all they've learned and seen
407,INDEX,Through the long absence that has been.
408,INDEX,
409,INDEX,We'll meet the friends who have been kind
410,INDEX,To them the while we stayed behind--
411,INDEX,"Angels who long have dwelt above,"
412,INDEX,"Who welcomed them with arms of love,"
413,INDEX,"And sheltered them the long years through,"
414,INDEX,Just as we'd prayed for them to do.
415,INDEX,
416,INDEX,"Though now you mourn, who stay behind,"
417,INDEX,"How sad 'twould be to leave, and find"
418,INDEX,Upon that distant other shore
419,INDEX,No loved one who had gone before--
420,INDEX,The gates of Heaven to enter through
421,INDEX,With no one there to welcome you.
422,INDEX,
423,INDEX,"As now, when some long journey ends"
424,INDEX,And we're received by smiling friends
425,INDEX,"Who've watched and waited for our train,"
426,INDEX,So shall they welcome us again;
427,INDEX,"The young, the beautiful and fair"
428,INDEX,Will all be waiting for us there.

433,INDEX,_Visitors_
434,INDEX,
435,INDEX,"We've had a lot of visitors, it seems, for weeks"
436,INDEX,"an' weeks,"
437,INDEX,And Pa is gettin' all run down.  Ma says that
438,INDEX,when he speaks
439,INDEX,He isn't civil any more.  He mopes around the place
440,INDEX,And always seems to wear a look of sadness on
441,INDEX,his face.
442,INDEX,And yesterday he said to Ma when she began to fuss:
443,INDEX,"""I wonder when they're going to quit an' leave the"
444,INDEX,home to us.
445,INDEX,
446,INDEX,"""It's nice to have your people come, but some of"
447,INDEX,them should go;
448,INDEX,Instead of that they're sticking here like bull dogs
449,INDEX,at a show.
450,INDEX,"'The more the merrier,' they shout, as other ones drop in."
451,INDEX,I'm getting so I cannot stand to see your cousins grin
452,INDEX,"And, what is more, I'm getting tired of driving"
453,INDEX,folks about
454,INDEX,And mighty tired of visitors who must be taken out.
455,INDEX,
456,INDEX,"""Night after night when I've come home I've hauled"
457,INDEX,"them near and far,"
458,INDEX,You'd think I was the driver of a town sight-seeing car.
459,INDEX,"I've hauled them up to factories and monuments and parks,"
460,INDEX,Museums and aquariums; I've shown 'em seals and sharks
461,INDEX,And bears and wolves and elephants; and now I want to quit.
462,INDEX,"I know they'd do the same for me, but I am sick of it."
463,INDEX,
464,INDEX,"""I wouldn't say a word at all about your folks, I know"
465,INDEX,"They're just as nice as they can be, but still I wish"
466,INDEX,they'd go.
467,INDEX,"I'm tired of all the buzz and talk, the tales of those"
468,INDEX,who've died;
469,INDEX,"I'm tired of seeing all our chairs forever occupied."""
470,INDEX,"""And I am tired myself,"" said Ma, ""as tired as I can be,"
471,INDEX,"You're only on the job at night, but it's all day"
472,INDEX,"long for me."""
473,INDEX,
474,INDEX,
475,INDEX,
476,INDEX,
477,INDEX,_When Father Broke His Arm_
478,INDEX,
479,INDEX,Pa never gets a story straight.
480,INDEX,"He's always mixed about the date,"
481,INDEX,"Or where it was, or what occurred,"
482,INDEX,Or who related what he heard;
483,INDEX,And every time he starts to tell
484,INDEX,"Some little story he knows well,"
485,INDEX,"Ma says: ""No, Pa, as I recall,"
486,INDEX,"That isn't how it was at all."""
487,INDEX,
488,INDEX,"""Remember when I broke my arm,"""
489,INDEX,"Says Pa, ""when we were on the farm"
490,INDEX,And I went out that slippery morn
491,INDEX,"A few days after Bud was born,"
492,INDEX,"To get some wood""--and Ma says then:"
493,INDEX,"""Oh, Pa, don't tell that tale again!"
494,INDEX,"And anyhow, I know right well"
495,INDEX,"Bud wasn't born the day you fell."""
496,INDEX,
497,INDEX,"""'Twas months before he came,"" says Ma."
498,INDEX,"""'Twas after he was born,"" says Pa;"
499,INDEX,"""I rather think I ought to know"
500,INDEX,"Just when it was I suffered so."""
501,INDEX,"""Maybe you ought,"" says Ma, ""but still,"
502,INDEX,"I saw you tumble down the hill,"
503,INDEX,And it was March with snow drifts high--
504,INDEX,"Bud wasn't born till next July."""
505,INDEX,
506,INDEX,"""I'd walk him round the floor,"" says Pa."
507,INDEX,"""You're all mixed up again,"" says Ma."
508,INDEX,"""We'll ask Aunt Lizzie, she was there,"
509,INDEX,"She'd come to help.""  Says Ma: ""I swear"
510,INDEX,"You're just as crazy as a loon,"
511,INDEX,Aunt Lizzie didn't come till June.
512,INDEX,"To argue on is most absurd,"
513,INDEX,"Bud wasn't born when that occurred."""
514,INDEX,
515,INDEX,I wish I knew just what is what
516,INDEX,"Or whether I was born or not,"
517,INDEX,But I'll just have to sit and wait
518,INDEX,Until Pa gets his story straight;
519,INDEX,And I have never heard at all
520,INDEX,"Just how it was he chanced to fall,"
521,INDEX,For Pa and Ma can't yet agree
522,INDEX,Which one came first--the fall or me.
523,INDEX,
524,INDEX,
525,INDEX,
526,INDEX,
527,INDEX,_The Spirit of the Home_
528,INDEX,
529,INDEX,"Dishes to wash and clothes to mend,"
530,INDEX,"And always another meal to plan,"
531,INDEX,Never the tasks of a mother end
532,INDEX,"And oh, so early her day began!"
533,INDEX,"Floors to sweep and the pies to bake,"
534,INDEX,And chairs to dust and the beds to make.
535,INDEX,
536,INDEX,"Oh, the home is fair when you come at night"
537,INDEX,"And the meal is good and the children gay,"
538,INDEX,And the kettle sings in its glad delight
539,INDEX,And the mother smiles in her gentle way;
540,INDEX,So great her love that you seldom see
541,INDEX,Or catch a hint of the drudgery.
542,INDEX,
543,INDEX,"Home, you say, when the day is done,"
544,INDEX,Home to comfort and peace and rest;
545,INDEX,"Home, where the children romp and run--"
546,INDEX,There is the place that you love the best!
547,INDEX,Yet what would the home be like if you
548,INDEX,Had all of its endless tasks to do?
549,INDEX,
550,INDEX,"Would it be home if she were not there,"
551,INDEX,Brave and gentle and fond and true?
552,INDEX,Could you so fragrant a meal prepare?
553,INDEX,Could you the numberless duties do?
554,INDEX,"What were the home that you love so much,"
555,INDEX,Lacking her presence and gracious touch?
556,INDEX,
557,INDEX,She is the spirit of all that's fair;
558,INDEX,She is the home that you think you build;
559,INDEX,She is the beauty you dream of there;
560,INDEX,She is the laughter with which it's filled--
561,INDEX,"She, with her love and her gentle smile,"
562,INDEX,Is all that maketh the home worth while.
563,INDEX,
564,INDEX,
565,INDEX,
566,INDEX,
567,INDEX,_If I Were Sending My Boy Afar_
568,INDEX,
569,INDEX,If I were sending my boy afar
570,INDEX,"To live and labor where strangers are,"
571,INDEX,"I should hold him close till the time to go,"
572,INDEX,Telling him things which he ought to know;
573,INDEX,"I should whisper counsel and caution wise,"
574,INDEX,"Hinting of dangers which might arise,"
