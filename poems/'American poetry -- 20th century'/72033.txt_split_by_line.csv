372,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,"Once, when we heard the thunder of your wings,"
373,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,We looked upon the world--and Spring was there.
374,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,
375,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,"One time your armies swept across the sky,"
376,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,Your feathered millions in a mighty march
377,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,Filling with life and music all the arch
378,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,Where now a lonely swallow flutters by.
379,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,
380,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,"Where roam ye now, ye nomads of the air?"
381,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,In what far land? What undiscovered place?
382,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,Ye may have found the refuge of the race
383,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,That mortals visit but in dream and prayer.
384,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,
385,THE PASSENGER PIGEONS,"Perhaps in some blest land ye wing your flight,"

397,JUNE,Among the alders by the stream I heard a partridge drumming;
398,JUNE,"I heard a partridge drumming, June, a welcome with his wings,"
399,JUNE,And felt a softness in the air half Summer’s and half Spring’s.
400,JUNE,
401,JUNE,"I knew that you were nearing, June, I knew that you were nearing--"
402,JUNE,I saw it in the bursting buds of roses in the clearing;
403,JUNE,"The roses in the clearing, June, were blushing pink and red,"
404,JUNE,For they had heard upon the hills the echo of your tread.
405,JUNE,
406,JUNE,"I knew that you were coming, June, I knew that you were coming,"
407,JUNE,For ev’ry warbler in the wood a song of joy was humming.

417,THE BIGGER THING,Jest yesterday I watched an ant
418,THE BIGGER THING,A-totin’ in the summer sun;
419,THE BIGGER THING,I saw him puff an’ pull an’ pant
420,THE BIGGER THING,"With little burdens, one by one."
421,THE BIGGER THING,A wisp of straw acrost his way
422,THE BIGGER THING,"Once kept him busy fer an hour,"
423,THE BIGGER THING,An’ ant-miles long he walked that day
424,THE BIGGER THING,To git around a bloomin’ flower.
425,THE BIGGER THING,The sand he carried grain by grain--
426,THE BIGGER THING,Great boulders thet he had to lift--
427,THE BIGGER THING,"An’, with his engineerin’ brain,"
428,THE BIGGER THING,He sunk his shaft an’ run his drift.
429,THE BIGGER THING,"An’ then at night a Bigger Thing,"
430,THE BIGGER THING,"To which the Little Thing must kneel,"
431,THE BIGGER THING,"Creation’s self-appointed king,"
432,THE BIGGER THING,Wiped out the anthill with its heel.
433,THE BIGGER THING,O self-made boss of things thet creep
434,THE BIGGER THING,"An’ walk an’ fly, an’ yet are mute,"
435,THE BIGGER THING,When I consider how you keep
436,THE BIGGER THING,"Your kingdom of the bird an’ brute,"
437,THE BIGGER THING,When I consider how you speak
438,THE BIGGER THING,Your will among the smaller folk
439,THE BIGGER THING,An’ send your message to the weak
440,THE BIGGER THING,"In flyin’ lead an’ flamin’ smoke,"
441,THE BIGGER THING,When I consider how you stalk
442,THE BIGGER THING,The quiet wood with evil breath
443,THE BIGGER THING,"An’ leave behind you, as you walk,"
444,THE BIGGER THING,"A path of pain an’ trail of death,"
445,THE BIGGER THING,"I wonder how ’twould seem to you,"
446,THE BIGGER THING,"The silent people’s lord an’ king,"
447,THE BIGGER THING,"To tremble when you heard it, too--"

460,THE CHICKADEE,Cook scatters in the clearin’.
461,THE CHICKADEE,
462,THE CHICKADEE,It gethers up the crusts an’ crumbs
463,THE CHICKADEE,An’ jest as glad it chatters
464,THE CHICKADEE,As if it fed on biscuit fine
465,THE CHICKADEE,All soaked in milk er dipped in wine
466,THE CHICKADEE,An’ served on silver platters.

584,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,Has a perfectly miser’ble time;
585,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,There always is someone a-pickin’ a bone
586,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,With a king or a monarch sublime.
587,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,Some calculate maybe that bein’ a king
588,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,Is a job that is gen’ally fun--
589,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,"Well, well, it may be,"
590,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,"But the best thing, to me,"
591,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,Is jest settin’ right here in the sun.

593,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,"I reckon the party who sets in the chair,"
594,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,"In the President’s chair, an’ all that,"
595,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,Must tote on his person consider’ble care
596,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,An’ a passel of woe in his hat.

598,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,Or even for office to run--
599,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,"Well, that may be so,"

606,SETTIN’ IN THE SUN,That you’ve done gone an’ set on a bomb.

664,INSPIRATION,"He praised the brassy front of show,"
665,INSPIRATION,"The ruby’s fire and diamond’s glow,"
666,INSPIRATION,Yet none would listen.
667,INSPIRATION,
668,INSPIRATION,He wove him many labored rimes
669,INSPIRATION,"Of ended days and coming times,"
670,INSPIRATION,Of deeds that stirred him;
671,INSPIRATION,"He wrote of pomp and circumstance,"
672,INSPIRATION,"The flap of flag, the light of lance,"
673,INSPIRATION,But no one heard him.
674,INSPIRATION,
675,INSPIRATION,And thus he learned to know the pain
676,INSPIRATION,Of him who sings but sings in vain
677,INSPIRATION,"To ears averted,"
678,INSPIRATION,Like one who wakes his sweetest tone
679,INSPIRATION,To unresponsive walls of stone
680,INSPIRATION,In halls deserted.
681,INSPIRATION,
682,INSPIRATION,When all the merry melodies
683,INSPIRATION,He sang his fellow men to please
684,INSPIRATION,"Brought none to hear him,"
685,INSPIRATION,He turned from splendor and from pelf
686,INSPIRATION,"To sing a measure for himself,"
687,INSPIRATION,A song to cheer him.
688,INSPIRATION,
689,INSPIRATION,He wrote a song of long ago--
690,INSPIRATION,A vale where yellow lilies grow
691,INSPIRATION,"Beside a river,"
692,INSPIRATION,A path that leads the weary feet
693,INSPIRATION,Where meadowland and waters meet
694,INSPIRATION,And rushes quiver.
695,INSPIRATION,
696,INSPIRATION,"He wrote a song of childhood days,"
697,INSPIRATION,Of pleasant shade and wooded ways
698,INSPIRATION,And summer quiet--
699,INSPIRATION,"A bridge that spanned a gushing rill,"
700,INSPIRATION,"A humble cot upon a hill,"
701,INSPIRATION,With roses by it.
702,INSPIRATION,
703,INSPIRATION,"’Twas not the creature of his art,"
704,INSPIRATION,This song upwelling from his heart
705,INSPIRATION,In moments lonely;
706,INSPIRATION,"With memory his eyes grew dim,"
707,INSPIRATION,"For then his own soul sang to him,"
708,INSPIRATION,The poet only.
709,INSPIRATION,
710,INSPIRATION,But other mortals heard his tale
711,INSPIRATION,Of woodland path and verdant vale
712,INSPIRATION,"To heaven winging,"
713,INSPIRATION,And men who scorned his song before
714,INSPIRATION,Sought out the poet’s open door
715,INSPIRATION,To hear him singing.
716,INSPIRATION,
717,INSPIRATION,"Thus came to him his mistress Fame,"
718,INSPIRATION,Clad in her aureole of flame
719,INSPIRATION,And smile supernal;
720,INSPIRATION,"No more a fleeting vision now,"
721,INSPIRATION,She placed upon the singer’s brow
722,INSPIRATION,The kiss eternal.
723,INSPIRATION,
724,INSPIRATION,"And then the poet, fool and sage,"
725,INSPIRATION,"Turned gently from his written page,"
726,INSPIRATION,"While bravos thundered,"
727,INSPIRATION,"And, when he saw the listening throng"
728,INSPIRATION,"Of those who once had spurned his song,"

781,THE CHICKAMAUGA OAK,"The steady clank of steel,"

827,SUMMERTIME,"The leaves upon the alders clapped their hands, their little hands--"
828,SUMMERTIME,An errant breeze had teased them into laughter.
829,SUMMERTIME,"A ray of sun went dancing o’er the lands, the fertile lands,"
830,SUMMERTIME,The perfume of a rose came running after.
831,SUMMERTIME,"The waters of the river caught their smile, their cheery smile,"
832,SUMMERTIME,And rippled joy to ev’ry merry comer.
833,SUMMERTIME,"A robin fluttered softly to the stile, the shady stile,"
834,SUMMERTIME,And raised his head to sing a song of Summer.
835,SUMMERTIME,
836,SUMMERTIME,"A dainty maid came tripping o’er the grass, the springing grass,"
837,SUMMERTIME,The alder touched her gently on the shoulder.
838,SUMMERTIME,"The zephyr kissed the tresses of the lass, the little lass,"
839,SUMMERTIME,The saucy ray of sun was even bolder.
840,SUMMERTIME,"The waters came to meet her, lapped her feet, her tiny feet,"
841,SUMMERTIME,The roses threw their perfume all around her.

882,RAIN,"Rainin’, is it? So it is--"
883,RAIN,An’ I knew it would.
884,RAIN,When a man has rheumatiz
885,RAIN,In this old left stem of his
886,RAIN,He can tell as good
887,RAIN,When it’s go’n’ to leak
888,RAIN,As your fancy weatherman
889,RAIN,"Down here in Chicago can,"
890,RAIN,If he thinks a week.
891,RAIN,An’ I guess it’s jest because
892,RAIN,Rheumatiz an’ Nature’s laws
893,RAIN,Sort of work together--
894,RAIN,"Lots of moisture in the air,"
895,RAIN,"Rheumatiz a-plenty there,"
896,RAIN,Both mean stormy weather.
897,RAIN,
898,RAIN,This left stem of mine can smell
899,RAIN,Water miles away;
900,RAIN,This old stem of mine can tell
901,RAIN,Fifty furlongs from a well
902,RAIN,Where it ought to lay.
903,RAIN,An’ I’ll tell you why:
904,RAIN,"This old stem an’ me has tramped,"
905,RAIN,"Waded, swum an’ drove an’ camped,"
906,RAIN,"Never gittin’ dry,"
907,RAIN,"Forty Winters, forty Springs;"
908,RAIN,Do you wonder thet she sings
909,RAIN,When she smells the water?
910,RAIN,If you fellahs really knew
911,RAIN,All that laig an’ me went through
912,RAIN,Guess you’d think she oughter.
913,RAIN,
914,RAIN,You ain’t never had the luck
915,RAIN,Swampin’ in the snow;
916,RAIN,None of you ain’t never stuck
917,RAIN,To your boot-tops in the muck
918,RAIN,When it’s ten below.
919,RAIN,There ain’t none of you
920,RAIN,Ever drove the Chippeway
921,RAIN,In the early days of May
922,RAIN,"When a norther blew,"
923,RAIN,When the river water froze
924,RAIN,In your boots an’ in your clo’es--
925,RAIN,"Freezin’, thawin’, freezin’."
926,RAIN,If this stem of mine finds out
927,RAIN,"When there’s water ’round about,"
928,RAIN,Surely there’s a reason.
929,RAIN,
930,RAIN,"An’, besides, there’s quite a line"
931,RAIN,Of such signs of rain;
932,RAIN,There is many another sign
933,RAIN,’Ceptin’ this old stem of mine
934,RAIN,Thet is just as plain.
935,RAIN,There is bunions yet--
936,RAIN,Fer a corn er bunion is
937,RAIN,’Most as good as rheumatiz
938,RAIN,Prophesyin’ wet.
939,RAIN,"When you see a cat eat grass,"
940,RAIN,When you see the small-mouth bass
941,RAIN,"Sendin’ up a bubble,"
942,RAIN,When you hear a rain-crow caw--
943,RAIN,It is simply Nature’s law
944,RAIN,Indicatin’ trouble.
945,RAIN,
946,RAIN,"Rainin’, is it? So it seems;"
947,RAIN,It’s a nasty night.
948,RAIN,Yonder how the street lamp gleams!--
949,RAIN,"Like the light you see in dreams,"
950,RAIN,"Soft an’ far an’ white,"
951,RAIN,Like the light you see
952,RAIN,"When you let life’s half-hitch slip,"
953,RAIN,When you kind of lose your grip
954,RAIN,On the things thet be.
955,RAIN,An’ I sometimes think the shore
956,RAIN,Thet we all are headin’ for
957,RAIN,Looks so far an’ ghostly
958,RAIN,’Cause we’re lookin’ (like to-night
959,RAIN,We are lookin’ at the light)
960,RAIN,Through a fog-bank mostly.
961,RAIN,
962,RAIN,How the asphalt pavements shine!--
963,RAIN,Almost lookin’ clean.
964,RAIN,Ev’ry lamp post makes a line
965,RAIN,Like the shadow of a pine
966,RAIN,On a snowy scene.
967,RAIN,In the gutter nigh
968,RAIN,"Little ripples curl an’ comb,"
969,RAIN,"Little dirty rivers foam,"
970,RAIN,In an hour to die.
971,RAIN,"They are like the stream of life,"
972,RAIN,"Full of work an’ play an’ strife,"
973,RAIN,Proud with splash an’ splutter.
974,RAIN,Each believes himself a flood--
975,RAIN,Most of us is only mud
976,RAIN,Runnin’ down a gutter.
977,RAIN,
978,RAIN,"Rainin’? Sure enough it is,"
979,RAIN,But it ain’t the goods;
980,RAIN,Doesn’t git right down to biz
981,RAIN,Like the whirling raindrops whiz
982,RAIN,Up there in the woods.
983,RAIN,"It’s a city shower,"
984,RAIN,Like the other kinds of stuff
985,RAIN,"In the city, mostly bluff,"
986,RAIN,Lastin’ fer an hour.
987,RAIN,"Up there, when it rains, it rains,"
988,RAIN,"Fillin’ rivers, floodin’ plains,"
989,RAIN,Down the mountains washin’.
990,RAIN,"Up there when a rain we git,"
991,RAIN,"When we’re really through with it,"
992,RAIN,Things are jest a-sloshin’.
993,RAIN,
994,RAIN,Fer a rainstorm in the brush
995,RAIN,"Is the wettest thing,"
996,RAIN,Ground beneath you soft as mush
997,RAIN,"An’ around you all a hush,"
998,RAIN,Not a bird to sing--
999,RAIN,Jest the drippin’ slow
1000,RAIN,"Of the raindrops on the leaves,"
1001,RAIN,Spillin’ from a billion eaves
1002,RAIN,On the earth below;
1003,RAIN,"Jest a blanket in the mire,"
1004,RAIN,"Jest a smudgy kind of fire,"
1005,RAIN,Weak an’ slow an’ smoky;
1006,RAIN,Breakfast--pancakes simply lead;
1007,RAIN,Dinner--wet an’ soggy bread;
1008,RAIN,Supper--biscuits soaky.
1009,RAIN,
1010,RAIN,"Rainin’, is it? So it is."
1011,RAIN,Glad I’m high an’ dry.
1012,RAIN,When a man has rheumatiz
1013,RAIN,In this old left stem of his
1014,RAIN,"Keep inside, say I."
1015,RAIN,"Now, this city stuff"
1016,RAIN,"Ain’t like woods rain near as wet,"
1017,RAIN,"Ain’t like woods rain is, an’ yet"
1018,RAIN,It is wet enough.
1019,RAIN,"Course the woods rain is the best,"
1020,RAIN,"It is dampest, healthiest,"
1021,RAIN,Better altogether;
1022,RAIN,But I guess I’ll stay inside
1023,RAIN,Tryin’ to be satisfied
1024,RAIN,With this city weather.

1232,THE MYSTERY,"Heard a rustle in the hush,"
1233,THE MYSTERY,Somethin’ out of sight--
1234,THE MYSTERY,"Jest a footfall on the ground,"
1235,THE MYSTERY,Shakin’ of a tree;
1236,THE MYSTERY,But we argued all around
1237,THE MYSTERY,What the thing could be.
1238,THE MYSTERY,
1239,THE MYSTERY,"Jack, the stable-boy, he said"
1240,THE MYSTERY,Likely ’twas a colt--
1241,THE MYSTERY,"Farmer’s colt thet got its head,"
1242,THE MYSTERY,Broke its halter holt.
1243,THE MYSTERY,"Bill, the cookhouse flunkey, swore"
1244,THE MYSTERY,’Twas a bear er cub

1246,THE MYSTERY,Fer a snack of grub.
1247,THE MYSTERY,
1248,THE MYSTERY,"Pete, who likes to hunt when Fall"
1249,THE MYSTERY,"Comes around each year,"

1254,THE MYSTERY,Said their colt er deer er bear
1255,THE MYSTERY,Simply was a caff.
1256,THE MYSTERY,
1257,THE MYSTERY,So they set an’ argufied
1258,THE MYSTERY,What the thing could be;
1259,THE MYSTERY,"Ev’ry fellah took a side,"
1260,THE MYSTERY,Had a theory.
1261,THE MYSTERY,"Jack he chinned it with the chaps,"
1262,THE MYSTERY,Bill with all the boys;

1264,THE MYSTERY,There wasn’t any noise.
1265,THE MYSTERY,
1266,THE MYSTERY,"What the rustle was about,"
1267,THE MYSTERY,No one ever knew;
1268,THE MYSTERY,But one fact I figgered out
1269,THE MYSTERY,From that gabby crew:
1270,THE MYSTERY,"People look with diff’rent eyes,"
1271,THE MYSTERY,Hear with diff’rent ears;
1272,THE MYSTERY,That what closest to them lies
1273,THE MYSTERY,Ev’rything appears.
1274,THE MYSTERY,
1275,THE MYSTERY,Ev’ry nation is the best

1803,BROTHERS AND SONS,Not a tender thought of a mother’s kiss or a touch of sister’s hand.

1844,THE SNOW IS HERE,The snow is here.
1845,THE SNOW IS HERE,I heard it in the night
1846,THE SNOW IS HERE,Upon the roof in marshaled measure tramp.
1847,THE SNOW IS HERE,The passing year
1848,THE SNOW IS HERE,Has changed the world to white
1849,THE SNOW IS HERE,And set the seal of Winter on the camp.
1850,THE SNOW IS HERE,But yesterday
1851,THE SNOW IS HERE,A footpath down the hill
1852,THE SNOW IS HERE,Touched hands with other roads that led afar;
1853,THE SNOW IS HERE,But now the way
1854,THE SNOW IS HERE,Is hidden ’neath the chill
1855,THE SNOW IS HERE,Of diamonded drifts that glisten like the star.
1856,THE SNOW IS HERE,We are shut in
1857,THE SNOW IS HERE,"From ev’ry distant thing,"
1858,THE SNOW IS HERE,"That other life amid the world of men,"
1859,THE SNOW IS HERE,"From dirt and din,"
1860,THE SNOW IS HERE,Until returning Spring
1861,THE SNOW IS HERE,Shall find the road and waken us again.
1862,THE SNOW IS HERE,
1863,THE SNOW IS HERE,The chore-boy now
1864,THE SNOW IS HERE,His frosted finger blows
1865,THE SNOW IS HERE,And makes his path from islanded door to door;
1866,THE SNOW IS HERE,Like sturdy prow
1867,THE SNOW IS HERE,He parts the billowed snows
1868,THE SNOW IS HERE,And heaps his brands of comfort on the floor.
1869,THE SNOW IS HERE,The fire he plies
1870,THE SNOW IS HERE,With piles of pitchy pine
1871,THE SNOW IS HERE,Until the flames roar upward in a gale;
1872,THE SNOW IS HERE,And we arise
1873,THE SNOW IS HERE,"To breathe the wintry wine,"
1874,THE SNOW IS HERE,To plunge abroad and icy tasks assail.
1875,THE SNOW IS HERE,So breaks the day;
1876,THE SNOW IS HERE,So comes the arctic dawn
1877,THE SNOW IS HERE,In this our little world when snow is here;
1878,THE SNOW IS HERE,And so away
1879,THE SNOW IS HERE,The months shall follow on
1880,THE SNOW IS HERE,Till softer skies shall mark another year.
1881,THE SNOW IS HERE,
1882,THE SNOW IS HERE,The horses stamp
1883,THE SNOW IS HERE,"In clouds of steamy smoke,"
1884,THE SNOW IS HERE,The teamster’s voice of mastery await;
1885,THE SNOW IS HERE,Their bits they champ
1886,THE SNOW IS HERE,And shake their leather yoke--
1887,THE SNOW IS HERE,And life breaks forth where life is isolate.
1888,THE SNOW IS HERE,"Now from the wood,"
1889,THE SNOW IS HERE,"The timber on the hill,"
1890,THE SNOW IS HERE,Comes stroke of ax and sawyer’s steady swing;
1891,THE SNOW IS HERE,The tree that stood
1892,THE SNOW IS HERE,Beside the frozen rill
1893,THE SNOW IS HERE,In powdered snow to earth comes thundering.
1894,THE SNOW IS HERE,Thus passes day
1895,THE SNOW IS HERE,"With shout and merry call,"
1896,THE SNOW IS HERE,"With echoed blow and crosscut’s swishy sweep,"
1897,THE SNOW IS HERE,Until the gray
1898,THE SNOW IS HERE,Of eve envelopes all
1899,THE SNOW IS HERE,And drives us back to shelter and to sleep.
1900,THE SNOW IS HERE,
1901,THE SNOW IS HERE,"Though this our life,"
1902,THE SNOW IS HERE,"A rugged life and plain,"
1903,THE SNOW IS HERE,"Of sudden danger and of slow reward,"
1904,THE SNOW IS HERE,"The wind a knife,"
1905,THE SNOW IS HERE,"A scimitar of pain,"
1906,THE SNOW IS HERE,"With death to fight and frosty stream to ford,"
1907,THE SNOW IS HERE,"Though chill the way,"
1908,THE SNOW IS HERE,"Laborious the toil,"
1909,THE SNOW IS HERE,"Though rough the fare, the habitation rude,"
1910,THE SNOW IS HERE,"Though skies be gray,"
1911,THE SNOW IS HERE,"Though stubborn be the soil,"
1912,THE SNOW IS HERE,And even day a night of solitude--
1913,THE SNOW IS HERE,"We fondly know,"
1914,THE SNOW IS HERE,"We know, in other years"
1915,THE SNOW IS HERE,"When we shall look again on sunny seas,"
1916,THE SNOW IS HERE,This land of snow
1917,THE SNOW IS HERE,Shall rise from out our tears
1918,THE SNOW IS HERE,And dearest seem of all our memories.
