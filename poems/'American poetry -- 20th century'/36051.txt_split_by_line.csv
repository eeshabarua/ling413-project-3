63,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,
64,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,
65,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"It is impossible for me, feeling and watching the eternal tidal currents"
66,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"of liberty and individual life against tyranny and the type, which are"
67,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"clashing and rearing up their highest crimsoned waves at this hour, to"
68,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,publish without some word of deprecation a book of poems so personal for
69,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"the most part, and reflecting my own too easy taste of freedom rather"
70,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,than my share in the world's struggle towards an age and universe of it.
71,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"That struggle has always occupied my thoughts, and often my energies,"
72,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,and yet I have never identified myself with it or found my undivided
73,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,being there. I have found that rather in individual experience and in
74,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,those moments of energetic idleness when the life of universal nature
75,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,seemed to come to its bloom of realization in my consciousness. Life is
76,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,older than liberty. It is greater than revolution. It burns in both
77,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,camps. And life is what I love. And though I love life for all men and
78,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"women, and so inevitably stand in the ranks of revolution against the"
79,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"cruel system of these times, I loved it first for myself. Its"
80,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"essence--the essence of life--is variety and specific depth, and it can"
81,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,not be found in monotonous consecration to a general principle.
82,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"Therefore I have feared and avoided this consecration, which earnest"
83,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"friends for some reason always expect me to exemplify, and my poetry has"
84,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"never entered, even so deeply as it might, into those tempests of social"
85,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,change that are coloring our thoughts today.
86,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,
87,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"Poetry that has life for its subject, and untempered reality, is rather"
88,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,expected to manifest that irregular flow and exuberance of material over
89,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,structure with which Walt Whitman challenged the world. In America at
90,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,least the freedom and poignant candor of strong art is associated with
91,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"the tradition that he founded, and little is granted to that other"
92,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,tradition which finds its original in Edgar Allan Poe. There existed in
93,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"Europe, however, a succession of poets whose eyes turned back in"
94,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"admiration to Poe, and they were the poets of reality and those who"
95,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,touched the mood of social revolt. And for my part I think there is a
96,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"modern validity in the attitudes of both these poets, and a certain"
97,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,adjudication between them which a perfectly impersonal science might
98,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,propose.
99,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,
100,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"Every one who reads this book will be familiar, I suppose, with Walt"
101,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,Whitman's ideal of an American poetry so free and strong and
102,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,untrammelled of ornamentation that it should go out of the books it was
103,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"published in and stand up with the hills and forests on the earth. ""The"
104,ABOUT AMERICAN POETRY,"Poetry of the future,"" he said."

246,A PREFACE,"clashing and rearing up their highest crimsoned waves at this hour, to"
247,A PREFACE,publish without some word of deprecation a book of poems so personal for
248,A PREFACE,"the most part, and reflecting my own too easy taste of freedom rather"
249,A PREFACE,than my sense of the world's struggle towards an age and universe of it.
250,A PREFACE,"That struggle has always occupied my thoughts, and often my energies,"
251,A PREFACE,and yet I have never identified myself with it or found my undivided
252,A PREFACE,"being there. I have found that rather in individual experience, and in"
253,A PREFACE,those moments of energetic idleness when the life of universal nature
254,A PREFACE,seemed to come to its bloom of realization in my consciousness. Life is
255,A PREFACE,older than liberty. It is greater than revolution. It burns in both
256,A PREFACE,camps. And life is what I love. And though I love life for all men and
257,A PREFACE,"women, and so inevitably stand in the ranks of revolution against the"
258,A PREFACE,"cruel system of these times, I love it also for myself. And its"
259,A PREFACE,essence--the essence of life--is variety and specific depth. It can not
260,A PREFACE,be found in monotonous consecration to a general principle. Therefore I
261,A PREFACE,"have feared and avoided this consecration, which earnest friends for"
262,A PREFACE,"some reason always expect me to exemplify, and my poetry has never"
263,A PREFACE,entered even so deeply as it might into those tempests of social change
264,A PREFACE,that are coloring our thoughts today.
265,A PREFACE,
266,A PREFACE,
267,A PREFACE,"Poetry that has life for its subject, and democratic reality, is rather"
268,A PREFACE,expected to manifest that irregular flow and exuberance of material over
269,A PREFACE,structure with which Walt Whitman challenged the world. In America at
270,A PREFACE,least the freedom and poignant candor of strong art is associated with
271,A PREFACE,"the tradition that he founded, and little is granted to that other"
272,A PREFACE,tradition which finds its original in Edgar Allan Poe. There existed in
273,A PREFACE,"Europe, however, a succession of poets whose eyes turned back in"
274,A PREFACE,"admiration to Poe, and they were poets of reality, and those who touched"
275,A PREFACE,the mood of democratic revolt. And for my part I think there is a modern
276,A PREFACE,"validity in the attitudes of both these poets, a certain adjudication"
277,A PREFACE,between them which a perfectly impersonal science might propose; and
278,A PREFACE,that is what I should like to discuss with those who may enter
279,A PREFACE,sympathetically into this little volume.
280,A PREFACE,
281,A PREFACE,"They will all be familiar, I suppose, with Walt Whitman's ideal of an"
282,A PREFACE,"American poetry so free and strong and untrammelled of ornamentation,"
283,A PREFACE,that it should go out of the books it was published in and stand up with
284,A PREFACE,the hills and forests on the earth.

290,A PREFACE,
291,A PREFACE,"""In my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the"
292,A PREFACE,barriers of form between prose and poetry. I say the latter is

310,A PREFACE,"day of such conventional rhyme is ended. In America, at any rate, and as"
311,A PREFACE,"a medium of highest aesthetic practical or spiritual expression, present"
312,A PREFACE,"or future, it palpably fails, and must fail, to serve. The Muse of the"

327,A PREFACE,
328,A PREFACE,
329,A PREFACE,It may surprise some people to see this monumental challenge to the
330,A PREFACE,poets of the future confronted with the pathetic memory of Edgar Allan
331,A PREFACE,"Poe. And yet it is natural to place these two poets in contrast, and the"
332,A PREFACE,weight neither of genius nor of influence is altogether upon one side.
333,A PREFACE,"They are the two American poets of unique distinction, and they are the"
334,A PREFACE,fountains of the two strongest influences in all modern poetry of the
335,A PREFACE,occident. And it is worth observing that if Walt Whitman had written as
336,A PREFACE,"few pages of poetry as Poe did, his name would hardly be remembered,"
337,A PREFACE,whereas Poe would have established a literary tradition if he had
338,A PREFACE,written but five sorrowful lyrics. His individuality was so poignant.
339,A PREFACE,"His art was so exquisite. And not only was his art exquisite, but his"
340,A PREFACE,"philosophy of his art was as unique, assertive, and prodigious in"
341,A PREFACE,"contempt for his predecessors, as that of Walt Whitman. I have never"
342,A PREFACE,"read anything about any art more sheer and startling in its kind, than"
343,A PREFACE,"Poe's essay on ""The Philosophy of Composition""; and nothing more"
344,A PREFACE,energetically opposite to Walt Whitman could possibly be devised. To
345,A PREFACE,"convey the flavor of the contrast, I quote these sentences--inadequate"
346,A PREFACE,for any other purpose--from Poe's essay:
347,A PREFACE,
348,A PREFACE,"""Most writers--poets in especial--prefer having it understood"
349,A PREFACE,that they compose by a species of fine frenzy--an ecstatic
350,A PREFACE,intuition; and would positively shudder at letting the public
351,A PREFACE,take a peep behind the scenes at the elaborate and vacillating
352,A PREFACE,"crudities of thought, at the true purposes seized only at the"
353,A PREFACE,"last moment, at the innumerable glimpses of idea that arrived"
354,A PREFACE,"not at the maturity of full view, at the fully matured fancies"
355,A PREFACE,"discarded in despair as unmanageable, at the cautious"
356,A PREFACE,"selections and rejections, at the painful erasures and"
357,A PREFACE,"interpolations--in a word, at the wheels and pinions, the"
358,A PREFACE,"tackle for scene-shifting, the step-ladders and demon-traps,"
359,A PREFACE,"the cock's feathers, the red paint and the black patches...."
360,A PREFACE,
361,A PREFACE,"""For my own part, I have neither sympathy with the repugnance"
362,A PREFACE,"alluded to, nor at any time the least difficulty in recalling"
363,A PREFACE,"to mind the progressive steps of any of my compositions; and,"
364,A PREFACE,"since the interest of an analysis, or reconstruction, such as I"
365,A PREFACE,"have considered a _desideratum_, is quite independent of any"
366,A PREFACE,"real or fancied interest in the thing analyzed, it will not be"
367,A PREFACE,regarded as a breach of decorum on my part to show the _modus

370,A PREFACE,
371,A PREFACE,"""Let us dismiss, as irrelevant to the poem _per se_, the"
372,A PREFACE,circumstance--or say the necessity--which in the first place
373,A PREFACE,gave rise to the intention of composing _a_ poem that should
374,A PREFACE,suit at once the popular and critical taste.
375,A PREFACE,
376,A PREFACE,"""We commence, then, with this intention."
377,A PREFACE,
378,A PREFACE,"""The initial consideration was that of extent. If any literary"
379,A PREFACE,"work is too long to be read at one sitting, we must be content"
380,A PREFACE,to dispense with the immensely important effect derivable from
381,A PREFACE,"unity of impression; for, if two sittings be required, the"
382,A PREFACE,"affairs of the world interfere, and everything like totality is"
383,A PREFACE,at once destroyed....
384,A PREFACE,
385,A PREFACE,"""My next thought concerned the choice of an impression, or"
386,A PREFACE,"effect, to be conveyed: and here I may as well observe that,"
387,A PREFACE,"throughout the construction, I kept steadily in view the design"
388,A PREFACE,of rendering the work _universally_ appreciable. I should be
389,A PREFACE,carried too far out of my immediate topic were I to
390,A PREFACE,"demonstrate a point upon which I have repeatedly insisted, and"
391,A PREFACE,which with the poetical stands not in the slightest need of
392,A PREFACE,"demonstration--the point, I mean, that Beauty is the sole"
393,A PREFACE,legitimate province of the poem....
394,A PREFACE,
395,A PREFACE,"""But in subjects so handled, however skilfully, or with however"
396,A PREFACE,"vivid an array of incident, there is always a certain hardness"
397,A PREFACE,"or nakedness, which repels the artistical eye. Two things are"
398,A PREFACE,"invariably required: first, some amount of complexity, or more"
399,A PREFACE,"properly, adaptation; and, second, some amount of"
400,A PREFACE,"suggestiveness, some under-current, however indefinite, of"
401,A PREFACE,"meaning. It is this latter, in especial, which imparts to a"
402,A PREFACE,work of art so much of that _richness_ (to borrow from colloquy
403,A PREFACE,a forcible term) which we are too fond of confounding with _the
404,A PREFACE,"ideal_."""
405,A PREFACE,
406,A PREFACE,The opposition of these two characters and attitudes is complete. Upon
407,A PREFACE,"the one side a vast preoccupation with human meaning and morals, with"
408,A PREFACE,"health and the common reality and love and democracy, a grand contempt"
409,A PREFACE,"for beauty, and for the effort to attract or gratify a reader with"
410,A PREFACE,"""verbal melody,"" a contempt for everything that savors of deliberate"
411,A PREFACE,technique in art. Upon the other side also contempt--contempt like a
412,A PREFACE,piece of cold analytical steel for every pretense that the technique of
413,A PREFACE,"art is not deliberate, that poets are not seeking to attract and"
414,A PREFACE,"gratify, that truth or moral or meaning instead of beauty is the portent"
415,A PREFACE,of a poem--a disposition to seek beauty in unique and even unhealthy
416,A PREFACE,"places, a lonely aristocratic heart of pain, and a preoccupation with"
417,A PREFACE,"""verbal melody"" never before or since equalled in poetry. The details of"
418,A PREFACE,"this difference are fascinating, but the generalization of it is what"
419,A PREFACE,will illumine the modern problems about poetry. To Edgar Allan Poe a
420,A PREFACE,"poem was an objective thing, to Walt Whitman poetry was an act of"
421,A PREFACE,subjective expression. Poe would take sounds and melodies of words
422,A PREFACE,"almost actually into his hands, and carve and model them until he had"
423,A PREFACE,"formed a beautiful vessel, and he would take emotions and imaginations"
424,A PREFACE,"out of his heart and weave and inlay them in that vessel, and even the"
425,A PREFACE,"crimson out of his blood, and finally for ""enrichment"" he would seek out"
426,A PREFACE,in his mind the hue of some meaning or moral to pour over it until it
427,A PREFACE,was perfect. And these beautiful vessels he would set forth for view and
428,A PREFACE,"purchase, standing aside from them like a creative trader, proud, but no"
429,A PREFACE,more identified with them than as though he had made them out of the
430,A PREFACE,colors of shells. To Walt Whitman a poem was not a thing. His poetry
431,A PREFACE,"was himself. His meanings, emotions, experiences, love and wonder of"
432,A PREFACE,"life, filled him and he overflowed in language--without ""art,"" without"
433,A PREFACE,purpose but to communicate his being. So he maintained. His poem was
434,A PREFACE,"never an object to him, even after it had flowed full and he sought to"
435,A PREFACE,perfect its contours. His emendations were not often objective
436,A PREFACE,improvements; they were private remodellings to make the language a more
437,A PREFACE,direct and fluent identity with what he considered himself. This was the
438,A PREFACE,task upon which he labored as the poet of democracy and social love.
439,A PREFACE,
440,A PREFACE,"Now, it is not merely an accident, or a reflection upon America or upon"
441,A PREFACE,"human nature, that Walt Whitman, with all his yearnings over the average"
442,A PREFACE,"American and his offering of priesthood and poetry to the people, should"
443,A PREFACE,"remain the poet of a rather esoteric few, whereas Poe--even with the"
444,A PREFACE,handful of poems he wrote--may be said to be acceptable to the
445,A PREFACE,"generality of men. The Raven, or Helen, or Annabelle Lee, or some sad"
446,A PREFACE,"musical echo of the death of beauty, might be found in illuminated"
447,A PREFACE,"covers on the most ""average"" of American parlor tables, but never"
448,A PREFACE,"anything there of Walt Whitman--unless it be ""Captain, My Captain!"" the"
449,A PREFACE,one rather weak metrical poem he deigned to write. And there is
450,A PREFACE,"something deeply and really pathetic in this fact, and something which"
451,A PREFACE,only an adequate science of verse can explain. For the emotions and the
452,A PREFACE,meanings of Walt Whitman's poetry are actually the ones that interest
453,A PREFACE,simple and thoughtful people who have leisure to feel. His realizations
454,A PREFACE,"of life would be acceptable and be honored, as much at least as great"
455,A PREFACE,"art is ever honored, by the ""divine average,"" if they had been conveyed,"
456,A PREFACE,"as Poe's were, in vessels of light, which would make them objective, and"
457,A PREFACE,from which they might brim over with excess of subjective meaning and
458,A PREFACE,emotion.
459,A PREFACE,
460,A PREFACE,"I do not mean to express a wish that Walt Whitman had conveyed them so,"
461,A PREFACE,or the opinion that he could have been a more stupendous poetic and
462,A PREFACE,moral hero of nature by writing otherwise than he did. His propulsive
463,A PREFACE,"determination to put forth in this facile nineteenth century culture,"
464,A PREFACE,sweet with the decay and light with the remnant fineries of feudal
465,A PREFACE,"grandeur, the original, vast, unfinished substance of man, was a"
466,A PREFACE,phenomenon like the rising of a volcanic continent amid ships on the
467,A PREFACE,sea. No word but the words in his book can portray the magnitude of his
468,A PREFACE,achievement; no critic but Envy could judge it except as itself and by
469,A PREFACE,its own standard. But as a prophetic example of the poems of the
470,A PREFACE,"future, and especially the poems of democracy and social love, it"
471,A PREFACE,suffers a weakness--the weakness that Walt Whitman's character suffered.
472,A PREFACE,It is egocentric and a little inconsiderate of the importance of other
473,A PREFACE,people. Walt Whitman composed wonderful passages about universal social
474,A PREFACE,"love, but he could not be the universal poet exactly because he was not"
475,A PREFACE,social enough. He was not humble enough to be social. The rebel egoism
476,A PREFACE,"of democracy was in him the lordly and compelling thing, and though his"
477,A PREFACE,"love for the world was prodigious, it was not the kind of love that"
478,A PREFACE,gives attention instinctively to the egoism of others.
479,A PREFACE,
480,A PREFACE,"There may be no grand passion for the idea, but there is a natural"
481,A PREFACE,"companionship with the fact of ""democracy,"" in Poe's statement that he"
482,A PREFACE,"""kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work universally"
483,A PREFACE,"appreciable,"" and that statement more characteristically distinguishes"
484,A PREFACE,his attitude from Walt Whitman's than the different ways they had of
485,A PREFACE,"talking about beauty. All poets who mould their poems objectively, even"
486,A PREFACE,"though they may conceive themselves to be utterly alone with beauty, are"
487,A PREFACE,really in social communion with humanity. For that is what the word
488,A PREFACE,"_objective_ means. An object, or as we say, a ""thing,"" differs from"
489,A PREFACE,other elements of our experience only in that it can be experienced in
490,A PREFACE,the same form at different times and by different persons. And for an
491,A PREFACE,"object to be beautiful is for it to hold value in itself, so that"
492,A PREFACE,various perceivers may come from all sides and find it there. Therefore
493,A PREFACE,"one who moulds an object towards external perfection, however sad his"
494,A PREFACE,"solitude, enters directly into the ""universal friendship"" toward which"
495,A PREFACE,Walt Whitman directed so much of the longing of his words. One who pours
496,A PREFACE,out phrases direct from his emotion may experience a relief and glory
497,A PREFACE,"that implies listeners, and he may win listeners, but they will each"
498,A PREFACE,"rebuild out of his phrases their own different poem, and they will"
499,A PREFACE,comprise in their number only those endowed with the special power to
500,A PREFACE,build poems out of phrases poured out. And whatever we may wish were
501,A PREFACE,"true of the world, it is not true that the majority are so endowed."
502,A PREFACE,Therefore the poetry that is highly subjective is almost inevitably the
503,A PREFACE,"poetry of a few; and the ""direct expression of emotion"" achieves a less"
504,A PREFACE,clear and general social communion than the embodiment of emotion in an
505,A PREFACE,object of art.
506,A PREFACE,
507,A PREFACE,"It could be established, I believe, with mechanical precision, that the"
508,A PREFACE,rhythmic values most cherished by the social rebels who now write so
509,A PREFACE,"much ""free verse,"" are values practically incommunicable to others, and"
510,A PREFACE,"absolutely incommunicable by the method usually adopted, that of"
511,A PREFACE,printing words on a page. A little of that icy matter-of-fact realism
512,A PREFACE,with which Poe used to scatter the sweet foggy thoughts of the
513,A PREFACE,"literarious, while it might not affect the art of these poets, would"
514,A PREFACE,surely reduce the volume of what they have to say about it. For
515,A PREFACE,"instance, here is the answer of one of them to an assertion that the"
516,A PREFACE,"line division in free-verse is ""arbitrary,"" and that if we copied one of"
517,A PREFACE,"these long poems in solid prose, the poet himself could hardly ever"
518,A PREFACE,divide it again as it was:
519,A PREFACE,
520,A PREFACE,"""Free verse that is free verse is _not_ arbitrary. Much of it is, of"
521,A PREFACE,course--so are many canvases mere splashy imitations of Matisse. But
522,A PREFACE,there is free verse that resolves itself into just those lines--a little
523,A PREFACE,"more subtly than sonnets or triolets--by virtue of pauses, of"
524,A PREFACE,"heart-beats, of the quickness or slowness of your breath, and maybe of"
525,A PREFACE,your pulse itself.... It tries to give the rhythm value of those
526,A PREFACE,"hesitations, those quickenings and slowings of the flow of ideas, the"
527,A PREFACE,"flutterings--it is _closer to the breath_, as modern music and modern"
528,A PREFACE,"dance are, or as primitive music and primitive dance were."""
529,A PREFACE,
530,A PREFACE,"It is impossible not to respond to such assertions, for we know in"
531,A PREFACE,ourselves what these exquisite differential experiences are. Any one who
532,A PREFACE,has ever written love-letters--which are a kind of aboriginal
533,A PREFACE,"free-verse--knows what they are. And yet I believe it is obvious, if not"
534,A PREFACE,"demonstrable, that most of them are too individual to be communicated"
535,A PREFACE,even to a lover. Human nature is too various for it to be true that the
536,A PREFACE,"same hesitations, the same quickenings and slowings of the flow of"
537,A PREFACE,"ideas, flutterings of the breath or pulse, will reproduce themselves in"
538,A PREFACE,another upon the perception of the same visible symbols. And while this
539,A PREFACE,"fact may make the art of composition seem a little monotonous, it is"
540,A PREFACE,better that art should be monotonous than that the world should. And it
541,A PREFACE,would be a monotonous world in which different people were so much
542,A PREFACE,"alike, or we ourselves so much alike at different moments, that these"
543,A PREFACE,minute filigrees of feeling should be altogether durable and capable of
544,A PREFACE,being served round in paper and ink.
545,A PREFACE,
546,A PREFACE,There are values of verbal rhythm in a flow of thought and feeling which
547,A PREFACE,"exist for one individual alone, and for him once only. There are other"
548,A PREFACE,"values less delicate which he can reproduce in himself at will, but can"
549,A PREFACE,not altogether communicate to other minds whose thoughts and feelings
550,A PREFACE,"are too much their own. There are other values, still less delicate,"
551,A PREFACE,"which he might communicate by vocal utterance and rhythmic gesture,"
552,A PREFACE,taking possession as it were of the very pulse and respiration of
553,A PREFACE,others. But poetry which is composed for publication ought to occupy
554,A PREFACE,itself with those rhythmic values which may be communicated to other
555,A PREFACE,rhythmic minds through the printing of words on a page. It ought to do
556,A PREFACE,"this, at least, if it pretends to an attitude that is even in the most"
557,A PREFACE,minute degree social.
558,A PREFACE,
559,A PREFACE,A mature science of rhythm might be imagined to stride into the room
560,A PREFACE,"where these poets are discussing the musical values of their verse,"
561,A PREFACE,"seize two or three of the most ""free"" and subtle among them, lock them"
562,A PREFACE,"into separate sound-proof chambers, and allow them to read one of their"
563,A PREFACE,favorite passages into the ear of an instrument designed to record in
564,A PREFACE,spatial outline the pulsations of vocal accent. It is safe to assert
565,A PREFACE,that there would be less identity in the actual pulsations recorded than
566,A PREFACE,if the same two were reading a passage of highly wrought English
567,A PREFACE,prose.[1] And the reason for this is that free verse imports into
568,A PREFACE,English prose a form of punctuation that is exceedingly gross and yet
569,A PREFACE,absolutely inconsequential. Its line division has neither a metrical
570,A PREFACE,nor a logical significance that exists objectively. It can mean at any
571,A PREFACE,"time anything that is desirable to the whims, or needful to the"
572,A PREFACE,"difficulties, of the reader or the writer. It is a very sign and"
573,A PREFACE,instrument of subjectivity. To incorporate in a passage of printed
574,A PREFACE,"symbols an indeterminate element so marked and so frequent as that, is"
575,A PREFACE,"to say to the reader--""Take the passage and organize it into whatever"
576,A PREFACE,"rhythmical pattern may please yourself."" And that is what the reader of"
577,A PREFACE,"free verse usually does, knowing that if he comes into any great"
578,A PREFACE,"difficulty, he can make a full stop at the end of some line, and shift"
579,A PREFACE,the gears of his rhythm altogether. And since it is possible for one who
580,A PREFACE,is rhythmically gifted to organize _any indeterminate series of
581,A PREFACE,"impressions whatever_ into an acceptable rhythm, he frequently produces"
582,A PREFACE,"a very enjoyable piece of music, which he attributes to the author and,"
583,A PREFACE,"having made it himself, is not unable to admire. Thus a good many poets"
584,A PREFACE,"who could hardly beat a going march on a base drum, are enabled by the"
585,A PREFACE,gullibility and talent of their readers to come forward in this kind of
586,A PREFACE,"writing as musicians of special and elaborate skill. The ""freedom"" that"
587,A PREFACE,it gives them is not a freedom to build rhythms that are impossible in
588,A PREFACE,"prose, but a freedom from the necessity to build actual and continuous"
589,A PREFACE,"rhythms. Free verse avails itself of the rhythmic appearance of poetry,"
590,A PREFACE,"and it avoids the extreme rhythmic difficulties of prose, and so it will"
591,A PREFACE,"certainly live as a supremely convenient way to write, among those not"
592,A PREFACE,too strongly appealed to by the greater convenience of not writing. But
593,A PREFACE,as an object of the effort of ambitious artists I can not believe it
594,A PREFACE,"will widely survive the knowledge that it is merely a convenience, a"
595,A PREFACE,form of mumble and indetermination in their art.
596,A PREFACE,
597,A PREFACE,"Walt Whitman, however he may have been deceived about the social and"
598,A PREFACE,"democratic character of his form, was not deceived, as the modern"
599,A PREFACE,"eulogists of free verse are, about its subtlety. He thought that he had"
600,A PREFACE,"gained in volume and directness of communion, but he knew that he was"
601,A PREFACE,"discarding subtlety, discarding in advance all those beautiful and"
602,A PREFACE,decadent wonders of microscopic and morbid audacity that developed in
603,A PREFACE,"France among the admirers of Poe. The modern disciples of his form,"
604,A PREFACE,"however, are materially of Poe's persuasion, and like to believe that"
605,A PREFACE,they have in free verse an instrument expressly fitted for the
606,A PREFACE,"communication of those wonders, and of the most delicate modulations of"
607,A PREFACE,"that ""verbal melody"" that Whitman scorned. In this, from the true"
608,A PREFACE,"standpoint of criticism, Whitman has a commanding advantage over them,"
609,A PREFACE,and what can be said of free-verse in general can not be said of his
610,A PREFACE,poems. He did achieve the predominant thing that he aimed to achieve--he
611,A PREFACE,made his poetry rough and artless in spite of his fineness and art. He
612,A PREFACE,made it like the universe and like the presence of a man. In that
613,A PREFACE,triumph it will stand. In that character it will mould and influence the
614,A PREFACE,"literature of democracy, because it will mould and influence all"
615,A PREFACE,literature in all lands.
616,A PREFACE,
617,A PREFACE,"""Who touches this book touches a man."""
618,A PREFACE,
619,A PREFACE,"There is, however, another ideal of poetry that Walt Whitman confused"
620,A PREFACE,"with this one, and that he no more exemplified in his form than he"
621,A PREFACE,exemplified democratic and social communion. And this ideal is
622,A PREFACE,predominant too in the minds of his modern followers. It is the ideal of
623,A PREFACE,"being natural, of being primitive, dismissing ""refinements"" and the"
624,A PREFACE,tricks of literary sophistication. He wanted his poetry to sound with
625,A PREFACE,nature and the untutored heart of humanity. It was in the radiance of
626,A PREFACE,"this desire that he spoke of rhythmical prose as a ""vast diviner"
627,A PREFACE,"heaven,"" toward which poetry would move in its future development in"
628,A PREFACE,"America. Prose seemed diviner to him because it seemed more simple, more"
629,A PREFACE,large with candor and directness. But here again a cool and clear
630,A PREFACE,science will show that his nature led him in a contrary direction from
631,A PREFACE,its ideal. The music of prose is only dissimilar to that of poetry in
632,A PREFACE,"its complexity, its subtle and refined _dissimulation_ of the"
633,A PREFACE,"fundamental monotonous meter that exists, either expressed or implied,"
634,A PREFACE,in the heart of all rhythmical experience. Persons who can read the
635,A PREFACE,"rhythm of prose can do so because they have in their own breast, or"
636,A PREFACE,"intellect, a subdued or tacit perpetual standard pulse-beat, around"
637,A PREFACE,which by various instinctive-mathematical tricks of substitution and
638,A PREFACE,syncopation they so arrange the accents of the uttered syllables that
639,A PREFACE,"they fall in with its measure, and become one with it, increasing its"
640,A PREFACE,momentum and its effect of entrancement upon the nerves and body. There
641,A PREFACE,"is no rhythm without this metrical basis, no value in rhythm comparable"
642,A PREFACE,to the trance that its thrilling monotony engenders. Its undulations are
643,A PREFACE,"akin to the intrinsic character of neural motion, and that is why,"
644,A PREFACE,almost as though it were a chemical thing--a stimulant and narcotic--it
645,A PREFACE,takes possession of our state-of-being and controls it.
646,A PREFACE,
647,A PREFACE,Poetry only naïvely acknowledges this ecstatic monotony that lives in
648,A PREFACE,"the heart of all rhythm, brings it out into the light, and there openly"
649,A PREFACE,weaves upon it the patterns of melodic sound. Poetry is thus the more
650,A PREFACE,"natural, and both historically and psychologically, the more primitive"
651,A PREFACE,"of the two arts. It is the more simple. Meter, and even rhyme, which is"
652,A PREFACE,"but a colored, light drum-beat, accentuating the meter, are not"
653,A PREFACE,"""ornaments"" or ""refinements"" of something else which may be called"
654,A PREFACE,"""rhythmical speech."" They are the heart of rhythmical speech expressed"
655,A PREFACE,and exposed with a perfectly childlike and candid grandeur. Prose is the
656,A PREFACE,refinement. Prose is the sophisticated and studio accomplishment--a
657,A PREFACE,thing that vast numbers of people have not the fineness of endowment or
658,A PREFACE,cultivation either to write or read. Prose is a civilized sublimation of
659,A PREFACE,"poetry, in which the original healthy intoxicant note of the tom-tom is"
660,A PREFACE,"so laid over with fine traceries of related sound, that it can no longer"
661,A PREFACE,be identified at all except by the analytical eye of science.
662,A PREFACE,
663,A PREFACE,Walt Whitman was not really playful and childlike enough to go back to
664,A PREFACE,"nature. His poetry was less primitive and savage, than it was superhuman"
665,A PREFACE,and sublime. His emotions were as though they came to him through a
666,A PREFACE,celestial telescope. There is something more properly savage--something
667,A PREFACE,"at least truly barbarous--in a poem like Poe's ""Bells."" And in Poe's"
668,A PREFACE,"insistence upon ""beauty"" as the sole legitimate province of the"
669,A PREFACE,"poem--beauty, which he defines as a special and dispassionate"
670,A PREFACE,"""excitement of the soul""--he is nearer to the mood of the snake dance."
671,A PREFACE,Poetry was to him a deliberate perpetration of ecstasy. And one can see
672,A PREFACE,in reading his verses how he was attuned to sway and quiver to the mere
673,A PREFACE,"syllabic singing of a kettledrum, until his naked visions grew more"
674,A PREFACE,intense and lovely than the passions and real meanings of his life. It
675,A PREFACE,"is actually primitive, as well as childlike, to play with poetry in this"
676,A PREFACE,"intense and yet unsanctimonious way that Poe did, and Baudelaire too,"
677,A PREFACE,and Swinburne. Play is nearer to the heart of nature than aspiration. It
678,A PREFACE,"is healthier perhaps too, and more to the taste of the future, than"
679,A PREFACE,priesthood. I think the essence of what we call classical in an artist's
680,A PREFACE,attitude is his quite frank acknowledgment that--whatever great things
681,A PREFACE,may come of it--he is at play. The art of the Athenians was objective
682,A PREFACE,"and overt about being what it is, because the Athenians were educated,"
683,A PREFACE,"as all free men should be, for play. They were making things, and the"
684,A PREFACE,eagerness of their hearts flowed freely out like a child's through their
685,A PREFACE,"eyes upon the things that they made. That pearl of adult degeneration,"
686,A PREFACE,"the self, was very little cultivated in Athens; the ""artistic"
687,A PREFACE,"temperament"" was unborn; and sin, and the perpetual yearning beyond of"
688,A PREFACE,"Christians, had not been thought of. A little group of isolated and"
689,A PREFACE,exclusive miracles had not reduced all the true and current glories of
690,A PREFACE,"life to a status of ignobility, so that every great thing must contain"
691,A PREFACE,in itself intimations of otherness. The Athenians were radiantly
692,A PREFACE,"willing, without any cosmical preparation or blare of moral resolve, to"
693,A PREFACE,"let the constellations stay where they are. It was their custom to ""loaf"
694,A PREFACE,"and invite their souls,"" to be ""satisfied--see, dance, laugh, sing."""
695,A PREFACE,They were so maturely naïve that they would hardly understand what Walt
696,A PREFACE,"Whitman, with his declarations of animal independence, was trying to"
697,A PREFACE,recover from. And so it is by way of their happy and sun-loved city that
698,A PREFACE,we can most surely go back to nature.
699,A PREFACE,
700,A PREFACE,And when we have arrived at a mood that is really and childly natural--a
701,A PREFACE,"mood that will play, even with aspiration, and will spontaneously make"
702,A PREFACE,"out of interesting materials ""things"" to play with, and when in that"
703,A PREFACE,"mood we give our interest to the materials of reality in our own time,"
704,A PREFACE,then perhaps we shall find that we have arrived also at a poetry that
705,A PREFACE,"belongs to the people. For people are, in the depths of them and on the"
706,A PREFACE,"average as they are born, still natural, still savage. And there is no"
707,A PREFACE,"doubt that nature never fashioned them to work harder, or be more"
708,A PREFACE,"serious, or filled with self-conscious purports, than was necessary. She"
709,A PREFACE,meant them to live and flow out upon the world with the bright colors of
710,A PREFACE,their interest. And it will seem rather a fever in the light of
711,A PREFACE,"universal history, this hot subjective meaningfulness of everything we"
712,A PREFACE,modern occidentals value. The poets and the poet-painters of ancient
713,A PREFACE,China knew that all life and nature was so sacred with the miracle of
714,A PREFACE,being that only the lucid line and color was needed to command an
715,A PREFACE,"immortal reverence. They loved perfection devoutly, as it will rarely be"
716,A PREFACE,"loved, but they too, with their gift of delicate freedom in kinship with"
717,A PREFACE,"nature, were at play. And in Japan even today--surviving from that"
718,A PREFACE,"time--there is a form of poetry that is objective and childlike, a"
719,A PREFACE,"making of toys, or of exquisite metrical gems of imaginative"
720,A PREFACE,"realization, and this is the only poetry in the world that is truly"
721,A PREFACE,"popular, and is loved and cultivated by a whole nation."
722,A PREFACE,
723,A PREFACE,If with this pagan and oriental love for the created thing--the same
724,A PREFACE,love that kept a light in Poe's sombre heart--we enter somewhat
725,A PREFACE,"irreverently into Walt Whitman's volume, seeking our own treasure and"
726,A PREFACE,"not hesitating to remove it from its bed of immortal slag, we do find"
727,A PREFACE,poems in new forms of exquisite and wonderful definition. Sometimes for
728,A PREFACE,"the length of one or two or three lines, and occasionally for a stanza,"
729,A PREFACE,"and once for the whole poem--""When I heard at the close of the"
730,A PREFACE,"day""--Walt Whitman seems to love and achieve the carved concentration of"
731,A PREFACE,"image and emotion, the definite and thrilling chime of syllables along a"
732,A PREFACE,chain that begins and ends and has a native way of uttering itself to
733,A PREFACE,"all minds that are in tune. He seems, without losing that large grace of"
734,A PREFACE,"freedom from the pose and elegance of words in a book, which was his"
735,A PREFACE,"most original gift to the world, to possess himself of the mood that is"
736,A PREFACE,"truly primitive, and social, and intelligible to the hearts of simple"
737,A PREFACE,people--the mood that loves with a curious wonder the poised and perfect
738,A PREFACE,existence of a thing.

1284,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,
1285,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"Although so complex and difficult to construct, the sonnet has always"
1286,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,seemed to me a natural and almost inevitable form. Whether the reason
1287,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"lies in its intrinsic nature, or in the tradition that surrounds it, is"
1288,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"not easy to tell. A sonnet is almost exactly square, and yet it has a"
1289,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,division sufficiently off the centre to make its squareness admirable
1290,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"instead of tiresome; and perhaps this simple trait, together with its"
1291,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"closely woven structure of rhyme, is what gives it the quiet assurance"
1292,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,it has--the tranquil rightness of a thing of nature or natural
1293,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,convenience. I feel towards an excellent sonnet as I imagine an eager
1294,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,horse may feel towards a good measure tightly filled up with golden
1295,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,grain.
1296,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,
1297,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,This feeling is due partly to a kind of honesty of which the squareness
1298,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,of a sonnet is symbolic. It is a form in which poets can express
1299,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,themselves when they are not rhapsodically excited. And very often they
1300,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"are not so excited, and at such times if they write rapid lyrics they"
1301,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,have to whip themselves up with an emotion that they get out of the
1302,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,writing rather than out of the facts. And this makes much lyric poetry
1303,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"seem a little histrionic, whereas in order to create a sonnet at all, a"
1304,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,concentration and sustainment of feeling is required that is inevitably
1305,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,equal to its more temperate pretensions.
1306,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,
1307,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,The quality of being inevitably and honestly square may become a
1308,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"dreadful thing, however. And it makes this form inappropriate for"
1309,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,persons who have not at least a certain degree of lyrical taste. In the
1310,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"hands of such persons a sonnet is not a poem, but an enterprise. They"
1311,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"get inside that square with a whole lot of materials, colors and sounds"
1312,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"and old clothes of ideas, and they push them round, and if they can not"
1313,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"make them fill in properly and come up to the edges, they climb out and"
1314,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"get some more. And the result is so palpably spreadout an object, always"
1315,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"with lumps of imagery here and there, that it can not even be received"
1316,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,in the linear sequence that is natural to the eye and ear.
1317,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,
1318,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,This fault can be avoided by having strongly in mind while composing a
1319,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"sonnet, the virtues not specifically its own--the clarity, the running"
1320,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"and pouring in single stream, that are the qualities of song. And to"
1321,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,these qualities the strict convention of its rhymes and the traditional
1322,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"relation of the sonnet's parts, ought to give way when there is a"
1323,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"conflict between them, for if a poem has not rhapsody, it is the more"
1324,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"important that it should have grace. At least that is my opinion, and I"
1325,A PREFACE ABOUT SONNETS,"offer this preface, in expiatory rather than boastful vein, to those"

1784,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,
1785,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,Most of the friends who read the volume from which these poems are
1786,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"selected, wanted to ask me what I meant by one of the titles, ""The"
1787,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"Thought of Protagoras."" And I meant so much--I meant to convey in that"
1788,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,phrase the hue of the philosophic background upon which the colors of my
1789,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"life are drawn--that since I failed, I venture to enlarge its meaning"
1790,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,here with a word of confession.
1791,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,
1792,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,An attitude that might be called affirmative scepticism is native to my
1793,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"mind, and underlies every impulse that I have to portray the universal"
1794,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,character of life and truth. We seek among all our experiences for some
1795,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"absolute and steadfast value by which, or toward which, we may guide"
1796,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"ourselves, but there is no absolute value except life itself, the having"
1797,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,of experiences. And among all our opinions we seek for an objective and
1798,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"eternal truth, but nothing is eternally true except the variety of"
1799,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"opinions. Intermittently throughout the whole history of western, and I"
1800,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"suppose of eastern thought, this mood has arisen. It was the mood of"
1801,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"Protagoras, and of that Protagorean vein in Plato which is the height of"
1802,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"ancient wisdom. It arose again, after a period of bright-minded"
1803,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"investigation and formulation of ""isms,"" in Sextus Empiricus and the"
1804,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,little group of Alexandrian scientists--the last light to go out in the
1805,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"darkness of the reign of saints and theologies. Again, after those ages"
1806,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"of sombre and oppressive faith under the roof of the cathedral, it"
1807,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,appeared in the great Montaigne. The writings of Montaigne arrive in
1808,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"history with a bold and tranquil flavor of delight in free meditation,"
1809,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,as though the too Sunday-serious world had at last made up its mind to
1810,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,escape from church and go fishing. It is a reverent Sabbath holiday in
1811,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"human thought. Almost immediately, however, the insane passion of belief"
1812,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,recurs. Descartes' attempt at a surgery of doubt is only the pathetic
1813,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,opening of space for new and enormous growths of the old substance.
1814,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"Spinoza follows him, the God-intoxicated man, and Leibnitz and other"
1815,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"monumental believers. And then David Hume quietly prepares, and once"
1816,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"more offers to mankind, in his clear, humble and noble enquiry about"
1817,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"Human Understanding, the sceptic wisdom, the moral equilibrium, that"
1818,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,would save its health and reason. But Kant and Hegel and those
1819,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"mountainous Germans, the giants of soul-vapor, overwhelming again with"
1820,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"their rationalizations of primitive egotism, send all the world to the"
1821,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,mad-house of metaphysical conviction. And from this we are now again
1822,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,issuing awakened--for the fifth time. And today the awakener is no
1823,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,individual. The awakener is science--empirical science turning its brave
1824,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"eyes upon man, its maker, to reveal the origin and destroy the excessive"
1825,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,pretensions of his thoughts. And so once again the sanity of the world
1826,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,has been saved--or so at least it seems to one whose intellectual home
1827,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,is in these ages of sacred doubt.
1828,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,
1829,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"Thoughts that are abstract logically, are, psychologically, concrete"
1830,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,things. General ideas are specific occurrences. They are occurrences in
1831,A PREFACE ABOUT THEIR PHILOSOPHY,"an individual mind, reflecting perhaps a material disturbance in a"
