25,,"Thanks are due to the editors of Ainslie's, The Dial, Pearson's"
26,,"Poetry, Reedy's Mirror, and Vanity Fair, for their kind permission"
27,,to republish various of these poems.
28,,
29,,"This edition of ""A Few Figs from Thistles"" contains several poems"
30,,not included in earlier editions.
31,,
32,,
33,,
34,,First Fig
35,,
36,,My candle burns at both ends;
37,,It will not last the night;
38,,"But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends--"
39,,It gives a lovely light!
40,,
41,,
42,,
43,,Second Fig
44,,
45,,Safe upon the solid rock the ugly houses stand:
46,,Come and see my shining palace built upon the sand!
47,,
48,,
49,,
50,,Recuerdo
51,,
52,,"We were very tired, we were very merry--"
53,,We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.
54,,"It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable--"
55,,"But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,"
56,,We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;
57,,"And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon."
58,,
59,,"We were very tired, we were very merry--"
60,,We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;
61,,"And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,"
62,,From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;
63,,"And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,"
64,,"And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold."
65,,
66,,"We were very tired, we were very merry,"
67,,We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.
68,,"We hailed, ""Good morrow, mother!"" to a shawl-covered head,"
69,,"And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;"
70,,"And she wept, ""God bless you!"" for the apples and pears,"
71,,And we gave her all our money but our subway fares.
72,,
73,,
74,,
75,,Thursday
76,,
77,,"And if I loved you Wednesday,"
78,,"Well, what is that to you?"
79,,I do not love you Thursday--
80,,So much is true.
81,,
82,,And why you come complaining
83,,Is more than I can see.
84,,"I loved you Wednesday,--yes--but what"
85,,Is that to me?
86,,
87,,
88,,
89,,To the Not Impossible Him
90,,
91,,"How shall I know, unless I go"
92,,"To Cairo and Cathay,"
93,,Whether or not this blessed spot
94,,Is blest in every way?
95,,
96,,"Now it may be, the flower for me"
97,,Is this beneath my nose;
98,,"How shall I tell, unless I smell"
99,,The Carthaginian rose?
100,,
101,,The fabric of my faithful love
102,,No power shall dim or ravel
103,,"Whilst I stay here,--but oh, my dear,"
104,,If I should ever travel!
105,,
106,,
107,,
108,,Macdougal Street
109,,
110,,"As I went walking up and down to take the evening air,"
111,,"(Sweet to meet upon the street, why must I be so shy?)"
112,,I saw him lay his hand upon her torn black hair;
113,,"(""Little dirty Latin child, let the lady by!"")"
114,,
115,,"The women squatting on the stoops were slovenly and fat,"
116,,"(Lay me out in organdie, lay me out in lawn!)"
117,,And everywhere I stepped there was a baby or a cat;
118,,"(Lord God in Heaven, will it never be dawn?)"
119,,
120,,"The fruit-carts and clam-carts were ribald as a fair,"
121,,(Pink nets and wet shells trodden under heel)
122,,She had haggled from the fruit-man of his rotting ware;
123,,"(I shall never get to sleep, the way I feel!)"
124,,
125,,"He walked like a king through the filth and the clutter,"
126,,"(Sweet to meet upon the street, why did you glance me by?)"
127,,But he caught the quaint Italian quip she flung him from the gutter;
128,,(What can there be to cry about that I should lie and cry?)
129,,
130,,"He laid his darling hand upon her little black head,"
131,,(I wish I were a ragged child with ear-rings in my ears!)
132,,And he said she was a baggage to have said what she had said;
133,,(Truly I shall be ill unless I stop these tears!)
134,,
135,,
136,,
137,,The Singing-Woman from the Wood's Edge
138,,
139,,"What should I be but a prophet and a liar,"
140,,"Whose mother was a leprechaun, whose father was a friar?"
141,,"Teethed on a crucifix and cradled under water,"
142,,What should I be but the fiend's god-daughter?
143,,
144,,"And who should be my playmates but the adder and the frog,"
145,,That was got beneath a furze-bush and born in a bog?
146,,"And what should be my singing, that was christened at an altar,"
147,,But Aves and Credos and Psalms out of the Psalter?
148,,
149,,"You will see such webs on the wet grass, maybe,"
150,,"As a pixie-mother weaves for her baby,"
151,,You will find such flame at the wave's weedy ebb
152,,"As flashes in the meshes of a mer-mother's web,"
153,,
154,,But there comes to birth no common spawn
155,,"From the love of a priest for a leprechaun,"
156,,And you never have seen and you never will see
157,,Such things as the things that swaddled me!
158,,
159,,"After all's said and after all's done,"
160,,What should I be but a harlot and a nun?
161,,
162,,"In through the bushes, on any foggy day,"
163,,"My Da would come a-swishing of the drops away,"
164,,"With a prayer for my death and a groan for my birth,"
165,,A-mumbling of his beads for all that he was worth.
166,,
167,,"And there'd sit my Ma, with her knees beneath her chin,"
168,,"A-looking in his face and a-drinking of it in,"
169,,And a-marking in the moss some funny little saying
170,,That would mean just the opposite of all that he was praying!
171,,
172,,"He taught me the holy-talk of Vesper and of Matin,"
173,,"He heard me my Greek and he heard me my Latin,"
174,,"He blessed me and crossed me to keep my soul from evil,"
175,,"And we watched him out of sight, and we conjured up the devil!"
176,,
177,,"Oh, the things I haven't seen and the things I haven't known."
178,,"What with hedges and ditches till after I was grown,"
179,,"And yanked both ways by my mother and my father,"
180,,"With a ""Which would you better?"" and a ""Which would you rather?"""
181,,
182,,"With him for a sire and her for a dam,"
183,,What should I be but just what I am?
184,,
185,,
186,,
187,,She Is Overheard Singing
188,,
189,,"Oh, Prue she has a patient man,"
190,,"And Joan a gentle lover,"
191,,"And Agatha's Arth' is a hug-the-hearth,--"
192,,But my true love's a rover!
193,,
194,,"Mig, her man's as good as cheese"
195,,"And honest as a briar,"
196,,"Sue tells her love what he's thinking of,--"
197,,But my dear lad's a liar!
198,,
199,,"Oh, Sue and Prue and Agatha"
200,,Are thick with Mig and Joan!
201,,They bite their threads and shake their heads
202,,And gnaw my name like a bone;
203,,
204,,"And Prue says, ""Mine's a patient man,"
205,,"As never snaps me up,"""
206,,"And Agatha, ""Arth' is a hug-the-hearth,"
207,,"Could live content in a cup;"""
208,,
209,,Sue's man's mind is like good jell--
210,,"All one colour, and clear--"
211,,And Mig's no call to think at all
212,,"What's to come next year,"
213,,
214,,"While Joan makes boast of a gentle lad,"
215,,That's troubled with that and this;--
216,,But they all would give the life they live
217,,For a look from the man I kiss!
218,,
219,,"Cold he slants his eyes about,"
220,,"And few enough's his choice,--"
221,,"Though he'd slip me clean for a nun, or a queen,"
222,,"Or a beggar with knots in her voice,--"
223,,
224,,And Agatha will turn awake
225,,"While her good man sleeps sound,"
226,,And Mig and Sue and Joan and Prue
227,,"Will hear the clock strike round,"
228,,
229,,"For Prue she has a patient man,"
230,,"As asks not when or why,"
231,,And Mig and Sue have naught to do
232,,"But peep who's passing by,"
233,,
234,,Joan is paired with a putterer
235,,"That bastes and tastes and salts,"
236,,"And Agatha's Arth' is a hug-the-hearth,--"
237,,But my true love is false!
238,,
239,,
240,,
241,,The Prisoner
242,,
243,,"All right,"
244,,Go ahead!
245,,What's in a name?
246,,I guess I'll be locked into
247,,As much as I'm locked out of!
248,,
249,,
250,,
251,,The Unexplorer
252,,
253,,There was a road ran past our house
254,,Too lovely to explore.
255,,I asked my mother once--she said
256,,That if you followed where it led
257,,It brought you to the milk-man's door.
258,,(That's why I have not traveled more.)
259,,
260,,
261,,
262,,Grown-up
263,,
264,,"Was it for this I uttered prayers,"
265,,"And sobbed and cursed and kicked the stairs,"
266,,"That now, domestic as a plate,"
267,,I should retire at half-past eight?
268,,
269,,
270,,
271,,The Penitent
272,,
273,,"I had a little Sorrow,"
274,,"Born of a little Sin,"
275,,I found a room all damp with gloom
276,,And shut us all within;
277,,"And, ""Little Sorrow, weep,"" said I,"
278,,"""And, Little Sin, pray God to die,"
279,,And I upon the floor will lie
280,,"And think how bad I've been!"""
281,,
282,,Alas for pious planning--
283,,It mattered not a whit!
284,,"As far as gloom went in that room,"
285,,The lamp might have been lit!
286,,"My little Sorrow would not weep,"
287,,My little Sin would go to sleep--
288,,To save my soul I could not keep
289,,My graceless mind on it!
290,,
291,,"So up I got in anger,"
292,,"And took a book I had,"
293,,And put a ribbon on my hair
294,,"To please a passing lad,"
295,,"And, ""One thing there's no getting by--"
296,,"I've been a wicked girl,"" said I;"
297,,"""But if I can't be sorry, why,"
298,,"I might as well be glad!"""
299,,
300,,
301,,
302,,Daphne
303,,
304,,Why do you follow me?--
305,,Any moment I can be
306,,Nothing but a laurel-tree.
307,,
308,,Any moment of the chase
309,,I can leave you in my place
310,,A pink bough for your embrace.
311,,
312,,Yet if over hill and hollow
313,,"Still it is your will to follow,"
314,,"I am off;--to heel, Apollo!"
315,,
316,,
317,,
318,,Portrait by a Neighbor
319,,
320,,Before she has her floor swept
321,,"Or her dishes done,"
322,,Any day you'll find her
323,,A-sunning in the sun!
324,,
325,,It's long after midnight
326,,"Her key's in the lock,"
327,,And you never see her chimney smoke
328,,Till past ten o'clock!
329,,
330,,She digs in her garden
331,,"With a shovel and a spoon,"
332,,She weeds her lazy lettuce
333,,"By the light of the moon,"
334,,
335,,She walks up the walk
336,,"Like a woman in a dream,"
337,,She forgets she borrowed butter
338,,And pays you back cream!
339,,
340,,"Her lawn looks like a meadow,"
341,,And if she mows the place
342,,She leaves the clover standing
343,,And the Queen Anne's lace!
344,,
345,,
346,,
347,,Midnight Oil
348,,
349,,"Cut if you will, with Sleep's dull knife,"
350,,"Each day to half its length, my friend,--"
351,,"The years that Time takes off _my_ life,"
352,,He'll take from off the other end!
353,,
354,,
355,,
356,,The Merry Maid
357,,
358,,"Oh, I am grown so free from care"
359,,Since my heart broke!
360,,"I set my throat against the air,"
361,,I laugh at simple folk!
362,,
363,,There's little kind and little fair
364,,Is worth its weight in smoke
365,,"To me, that's grown so free from care"
366,,Since my heart broke!
367,,
368,,"Lass, if to sleep you would repair"
369,,"As peaceful as you woke,"
370,,Best not besiege your lover there
371,,For just the words he spoke
372,,"To me, that's grown so free from care"
373,,Since my heart broke!
374,,
375,,
376,,
377,,To Kathleen
378,,
379,,"Still must the poet as of old,"
380,,"In barren attic bleak and cold,"
381,,"Starve, freeze, and fashion verses to"
382,,Such things as flowers and song and you;
383,,
384,,Still as of old his being give
385,,"In Beauty's name, while she may live,"
386,,Beauty that may not die as long
387,,As there are flowers and you and song.
388,,
389,,
390,,
391,,To S. M.
392,,
393,,If he should lie a-dying
394,,
395,,I am not willing you should go
396,,"Into the earth, where Helen went;"
397,,"She is awake by now, I know."
398,,Where Cleopatra's anklets rust
399,,You will not lie with my consent;
400,,And Sappho is a roving dust;
401,,"Cressid could love again; Dido,"
402,,"Rotted in state, is restless still:"
403,,You leave me much against my will.
404,,
405,,
406,,
407,,The Philosopher
408,,
409,,"And what are you that, wanting you"
410,,I should be kept awake
411,,As many nights as there are days
412,,With weeping for your sake?
413,,
414,,"And what are you that, missing you,"
415,,As many days as crawl
416,,I should be listening to the wind
417,,And looking at the wall?
418,,
419,,I know a man that's a braver man
420,,"And twenty men as kind,"
421,,"And what are you, that you should be"
422,,The one man in my mind?
423,,
424,,"Yet women's ways are witless ways,"
425,,"As any sage will tell,--"
426,,"And what am I, that I should love"
427,,So wisely and so well?
428,,
429,,
430,,
431,,Four Sonnets
432,,
433,,
434,I,I
435,I,
436,I,"Love, though for this you riddle me with darts,"
437,I,"And drag me at your chariot till I die,--"
438,I,"Oh, heavy prince! Oh, panderer of hearts!--"
439,I,Yet hear me tell how in their throats they lie
440,I,Who shout you mighty: thick about my hair
441,I,"Day in, day out, your ominous arrows purr"
442,I,"Who still am free, unto no querulous care"
443,I,"A fool, and in no temple worshiper!"
444,I,"I, that have bared me to your quiver's fire,"
445,I,"Lifted my face into its puny rain,"
446,I,Do wreathe you Impotent to Evoke Desire
447,I,As you are Powerless to Elicit Pain!
448,I,"(Now will the god, for blasphemy so brave,"
449,I,"Punish me, surely, with the shaft I crave!)"
450,I,
451,I,
452,II,II
453,II,
454,II,"I think I should have loved you presently,"
455,II,And given in earnest words I flung in jest;
456,II,"And lifted honest eyes for you to see,"
457,II,And caught your hand against my cheek and breast;
458,II,And all my pretty follies flung aside
459,II,"That won you to me, and beneath your gaze,"
460,II,"Naked of reticence and shorn of pride,"
461,II,Spread like a chart my little wicked ways.
462,II,"I, that had been to you, had you remained,"
463,II,"But one more waking from a recurrent dream,"
464,II,"Cherish no less the certain stakes I gained,"
465,II,"And walk your memory's halls, austere, supreme,"
466,II,A ghost in marble of a girl you knew
467,II,Who would have loved you in a day or two.
468,II,
469,II,
470,III,III
471,III,
472,III,"Oh, think not I am faithful to a vow!"
473,III,Faithless am I save to love's self alone.
474,III,Were you not lovely I would leave you now;
475,III,After the feet of beauty fly my own.
476,III,"Were you not still my hunger's rarest food,"
477,III,"And water ever to my wildest thirst,"
478,III,I would desert you--think not but I would!--
479,III,And seek another as I sought you first.
480,III,"But you are mobile as the veering air,"
481,III,"And all your charms more changeful than the tide,"
482,III,Wherefore to be inconstant is no care:
483,III,I have but to continue at your side.
484,III,"So wanton, light and false, my love, are you,"
485,III,I am most faithless when I most am true.
486,III,
487,III,
488,IV,IV
489,IV,
490,IV,"I shall forget you presently, my dear,"
491,IV,"So make the most of this, your little day,"
492,IV,"Your little month, your little half a year,"
493,IV,"Ere I forget, or die, or move away,"
494,IV,And we are done forever; by and by
495,IV,"I shall forget you, as I said, but now,"
496,IV,If you entreat me with your loveliest lie
497,IV,I will protest you with my favorite vow.
498,IV,"I would indeed that love were longer-lived,"
499,IV,"And oaths were not so brittle as they are,"
500,IV,"But so it is, and nature has contrived"
501,IV,"To struggle on without a break thus far,--"
502,IV,Whether or not we find what we are seeking
503,IV,"Is idle, biologically speaking."
