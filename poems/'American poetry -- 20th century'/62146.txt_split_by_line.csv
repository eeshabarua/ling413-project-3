185,FOREWORD,"When I took the two poems from Nathalia’s mother, and promised to read"
186,FOREWORD,"them, I had seen none of the press notices of Miss Crane’s talent."
187,FOREWORD,Being only a quasi-journalist I seldom read the newspapers. I am
188,FOREWORD,"extremely skeptical of infant prodigies, and the poems of Nathalia’s"
189,FOREWORD,that I have since seen most quoted in newspaper articles about her
190,FOREWORD,are just what you would expect. They prove nothing except that she
191,FOREWORD,is a little girl with a lively fancy. Certain poems in this first
192,FOREWORD,"collection, however, seem to me to prove something more."
193,FOREWORD,
194,FOREWORD,Some long time ago in Scotland there was a little girl named Marjorie
195,FOREWORD,"Fleming, and to-day a twelve-year-old, Helen Douglas Adam, the daughter"
196,FOREWORD,"of a Scotch parson and his wife of Dundee, is her successor overseas to"
197,FOREWORD,the juvenile purple. Miss Adam has now been published both in England
198,FOREWORD,and America. Yet the best poems of hers that I have read do not seem to
199,FOREWORD,me to possess such individuality or such maturity of melody and diction
200,FOREWORD,"as Miss Crane’s best poems. Then there is our own Hilda Conkling, whose"
201,FOREWORD,"mother is a distinguished American poet, and who writes in free verse"
202,FOREWORD,and has published several volumes of poems. Hilda is a real poet. But
203,FOREWORD,she has never grappled with and conquered certain problems of poetic
204,FOREWORD,"structure from which Miss Crane, by sheer instinct, seems to have"
205,FOREWORD,wrested occasional victory.
206,FOREWORD,
207,FOREWORD,I took the two poems from Nathalia’s mother; and first I read _The
208,FOREWORD,Blind Girl_. I came upon the two verses:
209,FOREWORD,
210,FOREWORD,"In the darkness who would answer for the color of a rose,"
211,FOREWORD,Or the vestments of the May moth and the pilgrimage it goes.
212,FOREWORD,
213,FOREWORD,*       *       *
214,FOREWORD,
215,FOREWORD,"Oh, night, thy soothing prophecies companion all our ways,"
216,FOREWORD,Until releasing hands let fall the catalogue of days.
217,FOREWORD,
218,FOREWORD,These lines and the meditation from which they spring were the
219,FOREWORD,spontaneous phrasing and the natural meditation of--a child of ten.
220,FOREWORD,"That in itself, I think, is sufficiently remarkable."
221,FOREWORD,
222,FOREWORD,"In the darkness who would cavil at the question of a line,"
223,FOREWORD,Since the darkness holds all loveliness beyond the mere design.
224,FOREWORD,
225,FOREWORD,Strange insight for a comparative infant!
226,FOREWORD,
227,FOREWORD,"In her lighter moments--and, naturally, there are a great"
228,FOREWORD,many--Nathalia’s “heart is all a-flutter like the washing on the line”;
229,FOREWORD,"she “could not stain romance with monetary fee”; and, when she has sat"
230,FOREWORD,"upon a bumble-bee, she knows “the tenseness of humiliating pain.” Many"
231,FOREWORD,a grown humorist might envy the freshness of such amusing phrase.
232,FOREWORD,
233,FOREWORD,There is much laughter and nonsense in this book--that of a rather
234,FOREWORD,romantic little girl with a quick eye and ear and a pert fancy. But
235,FOREWORD,"there is, as I have intimated, more than that."
236,FOREWORD,
237,FOREWORD,Cloud-made mountains towered
238,FOREWORD,Beckoning to me;
239,FOREWORD,Visionary triremes
240,FOREWORD,Talked about the sea.
241,FOREWORD,
242,FOREWORD,There were strings of camels
243,FOREWORD,On the Tunis sands.
244,FOREWORD,There were certain cities
245,FOREWORD,Holding out their hands.
246,FOREWORD,
247,FOREWORD,Here the thing we call poetry asserts itself. The instinct for
248,FOREWORD,remarkable phrase and striking figurative expression is either
249,FOREWORD,inborn or it is not. Facility with rhyme and metre is not nearly so
250,FOREWORD,"remarkable. But when a child can write, as in the poem _My Husbands_,"
251,FOREWORD,
252,FOREWORD,I hear in soft recession
253,FOREWORD,The praise they give to me;
254,FOREWORD,I hear them chant my titles
255,FOREWORD,From all antiquity.
256,FOREWORD,
257,FOREWORD,"it is almost uncanny. Here is, if you like, a somewhat derivative"
258,FOREWORD,"diction, but here also is true poetry by every test."
259,FOREWORD,
260,FOREWORD,He showed me like a master
261,FOREWORD,That one rose makes a gown:
262,FOREWORD,That looking up to Heaven
263,FOREWORD,Is merely looking down.
264,FOREWORD,
265,FOREWORD,"Well, I not only wonder how she has learned simple finality of phrase"
266,FOREWORD,so quickly; I also wonder whether she can possibly realize the
267,FOREWORD,philosophical implications of her best poems.
268,FOREWORD,
269,FOREWORD,"As for imagery, Nathalia’s angels hearing “the hurdy-gurdies in the"
270,FOREWORD,Candle-Maker’s Row” is an example of her fancy that quickens into
271,FOREWORD,imagination. She sees the Oriental bees flying “in golden convoys to
272,FOREWORD,"the mountains of the moon,” she quizzically presents the pathos of _The"
273,FOREWORD,"Dinosaurs’ Eggs_; she has “steered by stars that sorrowed, with the"
274,FOREWORD,moonlight in our wake”; she sees Berkley Common
275,FOREWORD,
276,FOREWORD,"Like a manuscript, all yellow, and with many things deleted,"
277,FOREWORD,"Yet a manuscript completed, with embellishments most rare,"
278,FOREWORD,"Berkley Common lies forgotten, with its fields of everlasting,"
279,FOREWORD,And the sunlight on the windows of the empty houses there.
280,FOREWORD,
281,FOREWORD,"As to exactly what she is trying to say in _The Symbols_, I am in"
282,FOREWORD,"doubt, but it is hard to forget the Talmud stalking like a rabbi in a"
283,FOREWORD,gown.
284,FOREWORD,
285,FOREWORD,"On the one hand, with Nathalia, we have simply a rhyming gift turned"
286,FOREWORD,to amusing descriptions of certain fairly ordinary episodes and
287,FOREWORD,characteristics of life that interest every healthily alert young
288,FOREWORD,"lady. On the other hand, we have the beginnings of a poet with a true"
289,FOREWORD,"ear for rhythm, an eye for the color of words, and a fancy that often"
290,FOREWORD,rises into the realm of imagination. I only hope that the young lady
291,FOREWORD,will continue to enjoy all the ordinary incidents of her existence as
292,FOREWORD,"much as she has heretofore, and to perfect her technique in her spare"
293,FOREWORD,moments. It needs perfecting. It is hardly to be wondered at that her
294,FOREWORD,work is still in the experimental stage. She is not yet “the youngest
295,FOREWORD,"of the seers,” nor yet “released from fetters of ancestral pose,” but"
296,FOREWORD,there is undoubtedly conquest of poetic beauty “waiting down the years”
297,FOREWORD,"for her--“revisions of the ruby and the rose,” as she puts it. Read"
298,FOREWORD,the first two verses of _The Vestal_ and marvel that a young lady of
299,FOREWORD,Nathalia’s age should be able to master without effort such a perfectly
300,FOREWORD,Emily Dickinsonian idiom. This is no copy; it is something that even
301,FOREWORD,Emily Dickinson would not have been at all ashamed to have written. And
302,FOREWORD,that is a good deal to say.
303,FOREWORD,
304,FOREWORD,"Now as to prophecies, who can make them? Frankly, I have not the"
305,FOREWORD,slightest idea how Miss Crane’s gift may develop. I only know that
306,FOREWORD,she has given signs of astonishing precocity as a young poet. Her
307,FOREWORD,parents have wisdom and they will see that she is not spoiled. Her
308,FOREWORD,gifts will simply develop according to her experience of literature
309,FOREWORD,and her experience of life. It is a very ticklish thing to endeavor in
310,FOREWORD,any way to direct so young a gift. It will find by instinct its own
311,FOREWORD,nourishment; that is my belief.
312,FOREWORD,
313,FOREWORD,"Meanwhile, to Nathalia, good luck on the difficult road!"

324,NATHALIA AT TEN,
325,NATHALIA AT TEN,"Nathalia’s day is today. All of Time that is past, from the birth of"
326,NATHALIA AT TEN,"those odd old folk, the troglodytes, about which she has ruminated so"
327,NATHALIA AT TEN,"pleasantly, up to and through the final scene of the latest Broadway"
328,NATHALIA AT TEN,"moving picture is, to her, a harvested crop--important in its way but"
329,NATHALIA AT TEN,"no longer interesting. And as for tomorrow and the next year, they will"
330,NATHALIA AT TEN,have their turn presently. It is today....
331,NATHALIA AT TEN,
332,NATHALIA AT TEN,This extract from Nathalia’s as yet unarticulated philosophy is offered
333,NATHALIA AT TEN,by way of information for those who are instinctively inclined to be
334,NATHALIA AT TEN,"harsh, on general principles, with a talent that springs, a little too"
335,NATHALIA AT TEN,"boldly perhaps, ahead of its years."
336,NATHALIA AT TEN,
337,NATHALIA AT TEN,Nathalia had been writing her verse for several months before Mr.
338,NATHALIA AT TEN,"and Mrs. Crane came across it, writing it without fuss or excitement"
339,NATHALIA AT TEN,"and storing it in a small and private album, content apparently with"
340,NATHALIA AT TEN,the reward of whatever pleasure the rereading of it gave her. If she
341,NATHALIA AT TEN,"had, even secretly, any concern with such a vanity as applause, she"
342,NATHALIA AT TEN,"certainly did not betray it. And when shortly before Christmas of 1922,"
343,NATHALIA AT TEN,the little girl mailed some of her poems to a Brooklyn newspaper and
344,NATHALIA AT TEN,"received immediate acknowledgment from the editor, her parents were as"
345,NATHALIA AT TEN,"much astonished as, later on, was the editor of a newspaper when, after"
346,NATHALIA AT TEN,"having accepted a number of poems signed Nathalia Crane, the author"
347,NATHALIA AT TEN,herself walked into the office and proved to be a mite of a human being.
348,NATHALIA AT TEN,
349,NATHALIA AT TEN,I was one of the file of reporters that trailed into Nathalia’s home
350,NATHALIA AT TEN,"the morning after her first publication, bent less on nourishing and"
351,NATHALIA AT TEN,encouraging a young artist than on getting a human-interest story.
352,NATHALIA AT TEN,"It was a file that eventually included generous, vociferous, and"
353,NATHALIA AT TEN,"indiscriminate eulogists, a file that threatened to demoralize or"
354,NATHALIA AT TEN,spoil whatever young talents Nathalia had.
355,NATHALIA AT TEN,
356,NATHALIA AT TEN,Those kind-hearted newspaper folks showered her with a shocking amount
357,NATHALIA AT TEN,"of almost unqualified praise, some of it accurately placed but most of"
358,NATHALIA AT TEN,it merely blank fire. This would have been very bad for her but for one
359,NATHALIA AT TEN,thing--Nathalia never read any of it.
360,NATHALIA AT TEN,
361,NATHALIA AT TEN,"And so, unaffected, she maintained the same tenor of her young days,"
362,NATHALIA AT TEN,playing with her dolls when she pleased and retiring to her boudoir to
363,NATHALIA AT TEN,"make rhythms when she pleased. She has always written, and still does"
364,NATHALIA AT TEN,"write, only when the fancy prompts her."
365,NATHALIA AT TEN,
366,NATHALIA AT TEN,"What Nathalia has written is the kind of thing that she can write,"
367,NATHALIA AT TEN,whatever its merits or demerits. She has measured it against no other
368,NATHALIA AT TEN,"verse, youthful or adult. The inspiration for most of it comes from"
369,NATHALIA AT TEN,"books she has read, which are mainly romantic in character. As for the"
370,NATHALIA AT TEN,"rest, it happens that she is an extraordinarily articulate little girl,"
371,NATHALIA AT TEN,and if in some cases the conceits and fancies which she crystallizes
372,NATHALIA AT TEN,"are no rarer than those that, in all probability, throng the mysterious"
373,NATHALIA AT TEN,"mind of every imaginative child, the explanation is simply that she"
374,NATHALIA AT TEN,"is able to utter and clarify them, and these other children are, for"
375,NATHALIA AT TEN,"the most part, normally unable to do that. That also they have, in"
376,NATHALIA AT TEN,"Nathalia’s case, taken the form of mature work, as evidenced, in one"
377,NATHALIA AT TEN,"way, by the fact that editors published her contributions for several"
378,NATHALIA AT TEN,months before learning that she was so much below the accepted age
379,NATHALIA AT TEN,"for serious consideration, is, I believe, another mark of her high"
380,NATHALIA AT TEN,singularity.
381,NATHALIA AT TEN,
382,NATHALIA AT TEN,"Others, unfortunately, will be less easily satisfied. A cynicism"
383,NATHALIA AT TEN,concerning the future careers of precocious children is one of the
384,NATHALIA AT TEN,"rigid fundamentals of nearly every mind. It has, no doubt, a valid"
385,NATHALIA AT TEN,"basis. But, for that reason, Nathalia’s future, probably very dark in"
386,NATHALIA AT TEN,"popular prospect, threatens to shade her present. That is why I offered"
387,NATHALIA AT TEN,"at the outset, as a point of information, the comment on Nathalia’s"
388,NATHALIA AT TEN,"general attitude toward life. Nathalia, I am sure, sees no reason why"
389,NATHALIA AT TEN,anybody else should read these poems with an eye any further ahead in
390,NATHALIA AT TEN,"time than this afternoon’s sunset. She is content to leave the verdict,"
391,NATHALIA AT TEN,"so far as posterity is concerned, to her own grandchildren."

424,THE JANITOR’S BOY,"He’ll carry me off, I know that he will,"

874,THE RAG BAG,And the things she threw away.
875,THE RAG BAG,
876,THE RAG BAG,"There were gloves that had no fingers,"
877,THE RAG BAG,And hose of Highland clans;
878,THE RAG BAG,There were petticoats from Paris
879,THE RAG BAG,And Pekin’s painted fans.
880,THE RAG BAG,
881,THE RAG BAG,Our fingers flew at random
882,THE RAG BAG,"Like bees at a flower stall,"

885,THE RAG BAG,
886,THE RAG BAG,"We carried it down from the garret,"

912,THE FIRST SNOW STORM,"And we sat down in the snow, Mama,"

1741,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,Is rather poor as we all know;
1742,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,"Her socks are a most unusual sight,"
1743,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,And her shoes are never quite watertight.
1744,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,
1745,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,She missed her lessons most every day;

1753,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,Gave her a piece to learn to recite.
1754,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,
1755,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,For three whole days we didn’t know
1756,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,The piece she had given to Mistress Snow;
1757,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,But on Monday morning Miss McHugh
1758,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,Said: “Margaret will speak for the 2-A-2.”
1759,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,
1760,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,"Then Mistress Margaret Esther wailed,"

1764,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,
1765,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,She made a most wonderful Grecian bow

1774,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,

1776,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,She gave us the whole of “The Light Brigade.”

1801,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,While the 2-A-2 just swelled with pride;

1803,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,That she didn’t know just the thing to do.
1804,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,
1805,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,"But she kissed our beauty of Soap Suds Row,"

1808,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,She was glad that her bread was bearing fruit.

1813,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,Made genius flourish in public schools.
1814,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,
1815,THE GIRL FROM SOAP SUDS ROW,"But somehow the girls in the 2-A-2,"

2063,AFTERWORD,
2064,AFTERWORD,In a maze of contributions such as the poetry editor of a large
2065,AFTERWORD,metropolitan newspaper printing daily two or three poems receives there
2066,AFTERWORD,came to me unheralded one morning in the mail a little poem which bore
2067,AFTERWORD,the name of an author of whom I had never heard--Nathalia Crane. It
2068,AFTERWORD,"was a whimsical piece of verse such as an editor rarely receives, a"
2069,AFTERWORD,"rhythmical, lilting production that would gladden the heart of any one."
2070,AFTERWORD,It was called _The History of Honey_. Needless to say it was accepted
2071,AFTERWORD,for publication. Subsequently others submitted by Nathalia Crane also
2072,AFTERWORD,found a place in _The Sun_.
2073,AFTERWORD,
2074,AFTERWORD,Then followed some correspondence in regard to various other poems but
2075,AFTERWORD,a call at the office made by the author in answer to a letter about the
2076,AFTERWORD,poem _The Army Laundress_ disclosed to my amazement that the writer was
2077,AFTERWORD,"none other than a little girl--a shy, unassuming youngster who was as"
2078,AFTERWORD,embarrassed during the interview as I was myself. For I must admit I
2079,AFTERWORD,was embarrassed--or rather taken aback.
2080,AFTERWORD,
2081,AFTERWORD,My surprise is excusable. So many times I had received “poems” from
2082,AFTERWORD,youngsters who were careful to give their ages in addition to their
2083,AFTERWORD,names; so often I had received visits from doting parents or relatives
2084,AFTERWORD,requesting publication of verses by their children or sisters or
2085,AFTERWORD,cousins that I had never dreamed any child would ever submit any work
2086,AFTERWORD,from his or her pen without adding the words “Aged -- years.” But
2087,AFTERWORD,little Nathalia was the exception--and there was nothing in her poems
2088,AFTERWORD,that I received to indicate her age.
2089,AFTERWORD,
2090,AFTERWORD,The poems bought were accepted on their merits and on their merits
2091,AFTERWORD,"alone, and many a poet of greater years and of recognized standing"
2092,AFTERWORD,"would not despise being known as the author of _The Reading Boy_, _The"
2093,AFTERWORD,Three Cornered Lot_ and _The Commonplace_.
2094,AFTERWORD,
2095,AFTERWORD,Nathalia Crane is a little girl who plays with dolls and toys and Roger
2096,AFTERWORD,"Jones, whom she has glorified in some of her poems, when she is not"
2097,AFTERWORD,busy at a typewriter giving expression to dreams and visions. She is
2098,AFTERWORD,also an author of delightful verse who obtained wide recognition of her
2099,AFTERWORD,work not because it was written by a child but because it was in itself
2100,AFTERWORD,"worth while reading. For this alone, if for nothing else, she deserves"
2101,AFTERWORD,"all the success that is hers, all the laurels with which her friends"
2102,AFTERWORD,and readers are glad to crown her and none more than the writer of this
2103,AFTERWORD,“Afterword” who came to know Nathalia Crane through her poetry which
2104,AFTERWORD,did not disclose her years.
