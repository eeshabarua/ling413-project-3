198,SECTION ONE,All I could see from where I stood
199,SECTION ONE,Was three long mountains and a wood;
200,SECTION ONE,"I turned and looked another way,"
201,SECTION ONE,And saw three islands in a bay.
202,SECTION ONE,So with my eyes I traced the line
203,SECTION ONE,"Of the horizon, thin and fine,"
204,SECTION ONE,Straight around till I was come
205,SECTION ONE,Back to where I’d started from
206,SECTION ONE,And all I saw from where I stood
207,SECTION ONE,Was three long mountains and a wood.
208,SECTION ONE,Over these things I could not see:
209,SECTION ONE,These were the things that bounded me;
210,SECTION ONE,"And I could touch them with my hand,"
211,SECTION ONE,"Almost, I thought, from where I stand."
212,SECTION ONE,And all at once things seemed so small
213,SECTION ONE,"My breath came short, and scarce at all."
214,SECTION ONE,"But, sure, the sky is big, I said;"
215,SECTION ONE,Miles and miles above my head;
216,SECTION ONE,So here upon my back I’ll lie
217,SECTION ONE,And look my fill into the sky.
218,SECTION ONE,"And so I looked, and, after all,"
219,SECTION ONE,The sky was not so very tall.
220,SECTION ONE,"The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,"
221,SECTION ONE,And--sure enough!--I see the top!
222,SECTION ONE,"The sky, I thought, is not so grand;"
223,SECTION ONE,I ’most could touch it with my hand!
224,SECTION ONE,"And reaching up my hand to try,"
225,SECTION ONE,I screamed to feel it touch the sky.
226,SECTION ONE,
227,SECTION ONE,"I screamed, and--lo!--Infinity"
228,SECTION ONE,Came down and settled over me;
229,SECTION ONE,"Forced back my scream into my chest,"
230,SECTION ONE,"Bent back my arm upon my breast,"
231,SECTION ONE,"And, pressing of the Undefined"
232,SECTION ONE,"The definition on my mind,"
233,SECTION ONE,Held up before my eyes a glass
234,SECTION ONE,Through which my shrinking sight did pass
235,SECTION ONE,Until it seemed I must behold
236,SECTION ONE,Immensity made manifold;
237,SECTION ONE,Whispered to me a word whose sound
238,SECTION ONE,"Deafened the air for worlds around,"
239,SECTION ONE,And brought unmuffled to my ears
240,SECTION ONE,"The gossiping of friendly spheres,"
241,SECTION ONE,"The creaking of the tented sky,"
242,SECTION ONE,The ticking of Eternity.
243,SECTION ONE,I saw and heard and knew at last

246,SECTION ONE,"The Universe, cleft to the core,"
247,SECTION ONE,Lay open to my probing sense
248,SECTION ONE,"That, sick’ning, I would fain pluck thence"
249,SECTION ONE,"But could not,--nay! But needs must suck"
250,SECTION ONE,"At the great wound, and could not pluck"
251,SECTION ONE,My lips away till I had drawn
252,SECTION ONE,"All venom out.--Ah, fearful pawn!"
253,SECTION ONE,For my omniscience paid I toll
254,SECTION ONE,In infinite remorse of soul.
255,SECTION ONE,"All sin was of my sinning, all"
256,SECTION ONE,"Atoning mine, and mine the gall"
257,SECTION ONE,Of all regret. Mine was the weight
258,SECTION ONE,"Of every brooded wrong, the hate"
259,SECTION ONE,"That stood behind each envious thrust,"
260,SECTION ONE,"Mine every greed, mine every lust."
261,SECTION ONE,"And all the while for every grief,"
262,SECTION ONE,"Each suffering, I craved relief"
263,SECTION ONE,"With individual desire,--"
264,SECTION ONE,Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire
265,SECTION ONE,About a thousand people crawl;
266,SECTION ONE,"Perished with each,--then mourned for all!"
267,SECTION ONE,A man was starving in Capri;
268,SECTION ONE,He moved his eyes and looked at me;
269,SECTION ONE,"I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,"
270,SECTION ONE,And knew his hunger as my own.
271,SECTION ONE,I saw at sea a great fog bank
272,SECTION ONE,Between two ships that struck and sank;
273,SECTION ONE,A thousand screams the heavens smote;
274,SECTION ONE,And every scream tore through my throat.
275,SECTION ONE,"No hurt I did not feel, no death"
276,SECTION ONE,That was not mine; mine each last breath
277,SECTION ONE,"That, crying, met an answering cry"
278,SECTION ONE,From the compassion that was I.
279,SECTION ONE,"All suffering mine, and mine its rod;"
280,SECTION ONE,"Mine, pity like the pity of God."
281,SECTION ONE,"Ah, awful weight! Infinity"
282,SECTION ONE,Pressed down upon the finite Me!
283,SECTION ONE,"My anguished spirit, like a bird,"
284,SECTION ONE,Beating against my lips I heard;
285,SECTION ONE,Yet lay the weight so close about
286,SECTION ONE,There was no room for it without.
287,SECTION ONE,And so beneath the weight lay I
288,SECTION ONE,"And suffered death, but could not die."
289,SECTION ONE,
290,SECTION ONE,"Long had I lain thus, craving death,"
291,SECTION ONE,When quietly the earth beneath
292,SECTION ONE,"Gave way, and inch by inch, so great"
293,SECTION ONE,"At last had grown the crushing weight,"
294,SECTION ONE,Into the earth I sank till I
295,SECTION ONE,"Full six feet under ground did lie,"
296,SECTION ONE,"And sank no more,--there is no weight"
297,SECTION ONE,"Can follow here, however great."
298,SECTION ONE,"From off my breast I felt it roll,"
299,SECTION ONE,And as it went my tortured soul
300,SECTION ONE,Burst forth and fled in such a gust
301,SECTION ONE,That all about me swirled the dust.
302,SECTION ONE,Deep in the earth I rested now;
303,SECTION ONE,Cool is its hand upon the brow
304,SECTION ONE,And soft its breast beneath the head
305,SECTION ONE,Of one who is so gladly dead.
306,SECTION ONE,"And all at once, and over all"
307,SECTION ONE,The pitying rain began to fall;
308,SECTION ONE,I lay and heard each pattering hoof
309,SECTION ONE,"Upon my lowly, thatchèd roof,"
310,SECTION ONE,And seemed to love the sound far more
311,SECTION ONE,Than ever I had done before.
312,SECTION ONE,For rain it hath a friendly sound
313,SECTION ONE,To one who’s six feet under ground;
314,SECTION ONE,And scarce the friendly voice or face:
315,SECTION ONE,A grave is such a quiet place.
316,SECTION ONE,
317,SECTION ONE,"The rain, I said, is kind to come"
318,SECTION ONE,And speak to me in my new home.
319,SECTION ONE,I would I were alive again
320,SECTION ONE,"To kiss the fingers of the rain,"
321,SECTION ONE,To drink into my eyes the shine
322,SECTION ONE,"Of every slanting silver line,"
323,SECTION ONE,"To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze"
324,SECTION ONE,From drenched and dripping apple-trees.
325,SECTION ONE,"For soon the shower will be done,"
326,SECTION ONE,And then the broad face of the sun
327,SECTION ONE,Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth
328,SECTION ONE,Until the world with answering mirth
329,SECTION ONE,"Shakes joyously, and each round drop"
330,SECTION ONE,"Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top."
331,SECTION ONE,"How can I bear it, buried here,"
332,SECTION ONE,While overhead the sky grows clear
333,SECTION ONE,And blue again after the storm?
334,SECTION ONE,"O, multi-coloured, multiform,"
335,SECTION ONE,"Beloved beauty over me,"
336,SECTION ONE,"That I shall never, never see"
337,SECTION ONE,"Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold,"
338,SECTION ONE,That I shall never more behold!
339,SECTION ONE,"Sleeping your myriad magics through,"
340,SECTION ONE,Close-sepulchred away from you!
341,SECTION ONE,"O God, I cried, give me new birth,"
342,SECTION ONE,And put me back upon the earth!
343,SECTION ONE,Upset each cloud’s gigantic gourd
344,SECTION ONE,"And let the heavy rain, down-poured"
345,SECTION ONE,"In one big torrent, set me free,"
346,SECTION ONE,Washing my grave away from me!
347,SECTION ONE,
348,SECTION ONE,I ceased; and through the breathless hush
349,SECTION ONE,"That answered me, the far-off rush"
350,SECTION ONE,Of herald wings came whispering
351,SECTION ONE,Like music down the vibrant string
352,SECTION ONE,"Of my ascending prayer, and--crash!"
353,SECTION ONE,Before the wild wind’s whistling lash
354,SECTION ONE,The startled storm-clouds reared on high
355,SECTION ONE,"And plunged in terror down the sky,"
356,SECTION ONE,And the big rain in one black wave
357,SECTION ONE,Fell from the sky and struck my grave.
358,SECTION ONE,I know not how such things can be;
359,SECTION ONE,I only know there came to me
360,SECTION ONE,A fragrance such as never clings
361,SECTION ONE,To aught save happy living things;
362,SECTION ONE,A sound as of some joyous elf
363,SECTION ONE,"Singing sweet songs to please himself,"
364,SECTION ONE,"And, through and over everything,"
365,SECTION ONE,A sense of glad awakening.
366,SECTION ONE,"The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,"
367,SECTION ONE,Whispering to me I could hear;
368,SECTION ONE,I felt the rain’s cool finger-tips
369,SECTION ONE,"Brushed tenderly across my lips,"
370,SECTION ONE,"Laid gently on my sealèd sight,"
371,SECTION ONE,And all at once the heavy night
372,SECTION ONE,"Fell from my eyes and I could see,--"
373,SECTION ONE,"A drenched and dripping apple-tree,"
374,SECTION ONE,"A last long line of silver rain,"
375,SECTION ONE,A sky grown clear and blue again.
376,SECTION ONE,And as I looked a quickening gust
377,SECTION ONE,Of wind blew up to me and thrust
378,SECTION ONE,Into my face a miracle
379,SECTION ONE,"Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,--"
380,SECTION ONE,I know not how such things can be!--
381,SECTION ONE,I breathed my soul back into me.
382,SECTION ONE,
383,SECTION ONE,Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I
384,SECTION ONE,And hailed the earth with such a cry
385,SECTION ONE,As is not heard save from a man
386,SECTION ONE,"Who has been dead, and lives again."
387,SECTION ONE,About the trees my arms I wound;
388,SECTION ONE,Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;
389,SECTION ONE,I raised my quivering arms on high;
390,SECTION ONE,"I laughed and laughed into the sky,"
391,SECTION ONE,Till at my throat a strangling sob
392,SECTION ONE,"Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb"
393,SECTION ONE,Sent instant tears into my eyes;
394,SECTION ONE,"O God, I cried, no dark disguise"
395,SECTION ONE,Can e’er hereafter hide from me
396,SECTION ONE,Thy radiant identity!
397,SECTION ONE,Thou canst not move across the grass
398,SECTION ONE,"But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,"
399,SECTION ONE,"Nor speak, however silently,"
400,SECTION ONE,But my hushed voice will answer Thee.
401,SECTION ONE,I know the path that tells Thy way
402,SECTION ONE,Through the cool eve of every day;
403,SECTION ONE,"God, I can push the grass apart"
404,SECTION ONE,And lay my finger on Thy heart!
405,SECTION ONE,

407,SECTION ONE,No wider than the heart is wide;
408,SECTION ONE,"Above the world is stretched the sky,--"
409,SECTION ONE,No higher than the soul is high.
410,SECTION ONE,The heart can push the sea and land
411,SECTION ONE,Farther away on either hand;
412,SECTION ONE,"The soul can split the sky in two,"
413,SECTION ONE,And let the face of God shine through.
414,SECTION ONE,But East and West will pinch the heart

2568,II,But such a laughter shook the mighty hall
2569,II,No one could hear me say:
2570,II,Had she been seen upon the Hill that day?

2586,II,"Minuter than the ashes of the dead,"
2587,II,"And Psyche’s lamp out of the earth up-thrust,"
2588,II,Dripping itself in marble wax on what was once the bed
2589,II,"Of Love, and his young body asleep, but now is dust instead."
2590,II,
2591,II,"There twists the bitter-sweet, the white wisteria"

2629,II,"Even in my veins that never will be dry,"

2639,II,And witnessed the desire and the despair
2640,II,Of souls that passed reluctantly and sicken for the air;
2641,II,"You, too, have entered Hell,"
2642,II,And issued thence; but thence whereof I speak

2666,II,Out of the urgent heat
