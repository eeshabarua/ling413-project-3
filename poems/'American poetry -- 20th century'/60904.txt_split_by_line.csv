145,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES
146,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
147,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
148,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Toward dusk, in the Summer of the year, a man dressed in a frock coat"
149,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"and top hat, and carrying a cane, crept through the underbrush bordering"
150,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,the corral of the Buckler farm.
151,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
152,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"As he moved, small twigs snapped, fell and were silent. His knees were"
153,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"green from wounded shrubbery and grass, and his outspread hands tore"
154,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"unheeded plants. His wrists hurt him and he rested from time to time,"
155,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"always caring for his hat and knotted yellow cane, blowing through his"
156,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,moustache.
157,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
158,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Dew had been falling, covering the twilight leaves like myriad faces"
159,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"damp with the perspiration of the struggle for existence, and half a"
160,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"mile away, standing out against the darkness of the night, a grove of"
161,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,white birches shimmered like teeth in a skull.
162,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
163,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He heard the creaking of a gate, and the splashing of late rain into the"
164,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,depths of a dark cistern. His heart ached with the nearness of the
165,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"earth, the faint murmur of it moving upon itself, like a sleeper who"
166,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,turns to throw an arm about a beloved.
167,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
168,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"A frog began moaning among the skunk cabbages, and John thrust his hand"
169,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,deep into his bosom.
170,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
171,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Something somnolent seemed to be here, and he wondered. It was like a"
172,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"deep, heavy, yet soft prison where, without sin, one may suffer"
173,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,intolerable punishment.
174,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
175,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Presently he went on, feeling his way. He reached a high plank fence and"
176,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"sensing it with his fingers, he lay down, resting his head against the"
177,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,ground.
178,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
179,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He was tired, he wanted to sleep, but he searched for his hat and cane"
180,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,and straightened out his coat beneath him before he turned his eyes to
181,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,the stars.
182,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
183,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"And now he could not sleep, and wondered why he had thought of it;"
184,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"something quick was moving the earth, it seemed to live, to shake with"
185,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,sudden immensity.
186,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
187,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He heard a dog barking, and the dim light from a farm window kept"
188,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,winking as the trees swung against its square of light. The odor of
189,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"daisies came to him, and the assuring, powerful smell of the stables; he"
190,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,opened his mouth and drew in his moustache.
191,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
192,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,A faint tumult had begun. A tremor ran under the length of his body and
193,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,trembled off into the earth like a shudder of joy—died down and repeated
194,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"itself. And presently he began to tremble, answering, throwing out his"
195,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"hands, curling them up weakly, as if the earth were withholding"
196,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"something precious, necessary."
197,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
198,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"His hat fell off, striking a log with a dull hollow sound, and he"
199,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"pressed his red moustache against the grass, weeping."
200,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
201,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Again he heard it, felt it; a hundred hoofs beat upon the earth and he"
202,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,knew the horses had gone wild in the corral on the other side of the
203,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"fence, for animals greet the Summer, striking the earth, as friends"
204,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"strike the back of friends. He knew, he understood; a hail to Summer, to"
205,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"life, to death."
206,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
207,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He drew himself against the bars, pressing his eyes under them, peering,"
208,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,waiting.
209,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
210,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He heard them coming up across the heavy turf, rounding the curve in the"
211,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,Willow Road. He opened his eyes and closed them again. The soft menacing
212,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"sound deepened, as heat deepens, strikes through the skin into the very"
213,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"flesh. Head on, with long legs rising, falling, rising again, striking"
214,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"the ground insanely, like needles taking terrible, impossible and"
215,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,purposeless stitches.
216,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
217,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He saw their bellies, fawn-coloured, pitching from side to side,"
218,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"flashing by, straining the fence, and he rose up on his feet and"
219,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"silently, swiftly, fled on beside them."
220,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
221,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Something delirious, hysterical, came over him and he fell. Blood"
222,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,trickled into his eyes down from his forehead. It had a fine feeling for
223,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"a moment, like a mane, like that roan mare’s mane that had passed"
224,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,him—red and long and splendid.
225,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
226,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He lifted his hand, and closed his eyes once more, but the soft pounding"
227,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"did not cease, though now, in his sitting position, it only jogged him"
228,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"imperceptibly, as a child on a knee."
229,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
230,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"It seemed to him that he was smothering, and he felt along the side of"
231,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,his face as he had done in youth when they had put a cap on him that was
232,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"too large. Twining green things, moist with earth-blood, crept over his"
233,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"fingers, the hot, impatient leaves pressed in, and the green of the"
234,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,matted grass was deathly thick. He had heard about the freeness of
235,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"nature, thought it was so, and it was not so."
236,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
237,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,A trailing ground pine had torn up small blades in its journey across
238,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"the hill, and a vine, wrist-thick, twisted about a pale oak, hideously,"
239,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"gloriously, killing it, dragging it into dust."
240,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
241,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"A wax Patrick Pipe leaned against his neck, staring with black eyes, and"
242,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"John opened his mouth, running his tongue across his lips, snapping it"
243,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"off, sighing."
244,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
245,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Move as he would, the grass was always under him, and the crackling of"
246,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,last Autumn’s leaves and last Summer’s twigs—minute dead of the infinite
247,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,greatness—troubled him. Something portentous seemed connected with the
248,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"patient noises about him. An acorn dropped, striking a thin fine powder"
249,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"out of a frail oak pod. He took it up, tossing it. He had never liked to"
250,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,see things fall.
251,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
252,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He sat up, with the dim thunder of the horses far off, but quickening"
253,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,his heart.
254,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
255,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He went over the scene he had with Freda Buckler, back there in the"
256,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"house, the long quivering spears of pot-grass standing by the window as"
257,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"she walked up and down, pulling at them, talking to him."
258,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
259,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Small, with cunning fiery eyes and a pink and pointed chin. A daughter"
260,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,of a mother who had known too many admirers in her youth; a woman with
261,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,an ample lap on which she held a Persian kitten or a trifle of fruit.
262,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Bounty, avarice, desire, intelligence—both of them had always what they"
263,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,wanted.
264,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
265,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,He blew down his moustache again thinking of Freda in her floating
266,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"yellow veil that he had called ridiculous. She had not been angry, he"
267,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,was nothing but a stable boy then. It was the way with those small
268,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,intriguing women whose nostrils were made delicate through the pain of
269,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,many generations that they might quiver whenever they caught a whiff of
270,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,the stables.
271,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
272,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“As near as they can get to the earth,” he had said, and was Freda"
273,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"angry? She stroked his arm always softly, looking away, an inner"
274,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,bitterness drawing down her mouth.
275,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
276,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"She said, walking up and down quickly, looking ridiculously small:"
277,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
278,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“I am always gentle, John”—frowning, trailing her veil, thrusting out"
279,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,her chin.
280,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
281,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,He answered: “I liked it better where I was.”
282,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
283,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“Horses,” she said showing sharp teeth, “are nothing for a man with your"
284,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"bile—pot-boy—curry comber, smelling of saddle soap—lovely!” She"
285,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"shrivelled up her nose, touching his arm: “Yes, but better things. I"
286,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"will show you—you shall be a gentleman—fine clothes, you will like them,"
287,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"they feel nice.” And laughing she turned on one high heel, sitting down."
288,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“I like horses, they make people better; you are amusing, intelligent,"
289,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,you will see——”
290,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
291,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“A lackey!” he returned passionately, throwing up his arm. “What is"
292,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"there in this for you, what are you trying to do to me? The"
293,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,family—askance—perhaps—I don’t know.”
294,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
295,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He sat down pondering. He was getting used to it, or thought he was, all"
296,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"but his wordy remonstrances. He knew better when thinking of his horses,"
297,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"realizing that when he should have married this small, unpleasant and"
298,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"clever woman, he would know them no more."
299,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
300,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"It was a game between them, which was the shrewder, which would win out?"
301,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He? A boy of ill breeding, grown from the gutter, fancied by this woman"
302,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"because he had called her ridiculous, or for some other reason that he"
303,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"would never know. This kind of person never tells the truth, and this,"
304,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"more than most things, troubled him. Was he a thing to be played with,"
305,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,debased into something better than he was—than he knew?
306,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
307,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Partly because he was proud of himself in the costume of a groom, partly"
308,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"because he was timid, he desired to get away, to go back to the stables."
309,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He walked up to the mirrors as if about to challenge them, peering in."
310,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He knew he would look absurd, and then knew, with shame, that he looked"
311,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,splendidly better than most of the gentlemen that Freda Buckler knew. He
312,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"hated himself. A man who had grown out of the city’s streets, a fine"
313,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,common thing!
314,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
315,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"She saw him looking into the mirrors, one after the other, and drew her"

317,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"them, taking his arm."
318,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
319,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“You shall enter the army—you shall rise to General, or Lieutenant at"
320,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"least—and there are horses there, and the sound of stirrups—with that"
321,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"physique you will be happy—authority you know,” she said, shaking her"
322,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"chin, smiling."
323,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
324,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“Very well, but a common soldier——”"
325,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
326,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,“As you like—afterward.”
327,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
328,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,“Afterward?”
329,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
330,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“Very well, a common soldier.”"
331,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
332,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He sensed something strange in her voice, a sort of irony, and it took"
333,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,the patience out of him:
334,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
335,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“I have always been common, I could commit crimes, easily, gladly—I’d"
336,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,like to!”
337,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
338,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"She looked away. “That’s natural,” she said faintly; “it’s an instinct"
339,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,all strong men have——”
340,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
341,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"She knew what was troubling him, thwarted instincts, common beautiful"
342,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,instincts that he was being robbed of. He wanted to do something final
343,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"to prove his lower order; caught himself making faces, idiot faces, and"
344,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,she laughed.
345,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
346,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“If only your ears stuck out, chin receded,” she said, “you might look"
347,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"degenerate, common, but as it is——”"
348,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
349,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"And he would creep away in hat, coat and with his cane, to peer at his"
350,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"horses, never daring to go in near them. Sometimes, when he wanted to"
351,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"weep, he would smear one glove with harness grease, but the other one he"
352,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"held behind his back, pretending one was enough to prove his revolt."
353,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
354,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"She would torment him with vases, books, pictures, making a fool of him"
355,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"gently, persistently, making him doubt by cruel means, the means of"
356,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"objects he was not used to, eternally taking him out of his sphere."
357,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
358,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“We have the best collection of miniatures,” she would say with one knee"
359,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"on a low ottoman, bringing them out in her small palm."
360,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
361,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“Here, look.”"
362,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
363,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,He would put his hands behind him.
364,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
365,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,“She was a great woman—Lucrezia Borgia—do you know history——” She put it
366,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"back because he did not answer, letting his mind, a curious one, torment"
367,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,itself.
368,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
369,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“You love things very much, don’t you?” she would question, because she"
370,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,knew that he had a passion for one thing only. She kept placing new
371,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"ladders beneath his feet, only to saw them off at the next rung, making"
372,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"him nothing more than a nervous, irritable experiment. He was uneasy,"
373,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"like one given food to smell and not to taste, and for a while he had"
374,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"not wanted to taste, and then curiosity began, and he wanted to, and he"
375,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"also wanted to escape, and he could do neither."
376,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
377,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Well, after he had married her, what then? Satisfy her whim and where"
378,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"would he be? He would be nothing, neither what he had been nor what"
379,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"other people were. This seemed to him, at times, her wish—a sort of"
380,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"place between lying down and standing up, a cramped position, a slow"
381,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,death. A curious woman.
382,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
383,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,This same evening he had looked at her attentively for the first time.
384,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Her hair was rather pretty, though too mousy, yet just in the nape of"
385,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"the neck, where it met the lawn of the collar it was very attractive."
386,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"She walked well for a little woman, too."
387,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
388,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Sometimes she would pretend to be lively, would run a little, catch"
389,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"herself at it, as if she had not intended to do it, and calm down once"
390,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"more, or creeping up to him, stroking his arm, talking to him, she would"
391,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"walk beside him softly, slowly, that he might not step out, that he"
392,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,would have to crawl across the carpet.
393,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
394,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Once he had thought of trying her with honesty, with the truth of the"
395,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"situation. Perhaps she would give him an honest answer, and he had"
396,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,tried.
397,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
398,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“Now, Miss Freda—just a word—what are you trying to do? What is it you"
399,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,want? What is there in me that can interest you? I want you to tell me—I
400,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"want to know—I have got to ask someone, and I haven’t anyone to ask but"
401,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,you.”
402,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
403,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"And for a moment she almost relented, only to discover that she could"
404,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,not if she had wished. She did not know always what she meant herself.
405,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
406,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“I’ll tell you,” she said, hoping that this, somehow, might lead her"
407,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"into the truth, for herself, if not for him, but it did not, “you are a"
408,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"little nervous, you will get used to it—you will even grow to like it."
409,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,Be patient. You will learn soon enough that there is nothing in the
410,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"world so agreeable as climbing, changing.”"
411,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
412,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“Well,” he said, trying to read her, “and then?”"
413,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
414,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“That’s all, you will regret the stables in the end—that’s all.” Her"
415,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"nostrils quivered. A light came into her eyes, a desire to defy, to be"
416,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,defied.
417,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
418,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Then on this last night he had done something terrible, he had made a"
419,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"blunder. There had been a party. The guests, a lot of them, were mostly"
420,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"drunk, or touched with drink. And he, too, had too much. He remembered"
421,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"having thrown his arms about a tall woman, gowned in black with loose"
422,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"shoulder straps, dragging her through a dance. He had even sung a bit of"
423,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"a song, madly, wildly, horribly. And suddenly he had been brought up"
424,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"sharp by the fact that no one thought his behaviour strange, that no one"
425,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,thought him presumptuous. Freda’s mother had not even moved or dropped
426,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"the kitten from her lap where it sat, its loud resolute purr shaking the"
427,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,satin of her gown.
428,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
429,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"And he felt that Freda had got him where she wanted him, between two"
430,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"rungs. Going directly up to her, he said:"
431,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
432,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“You are ridiculous!” and twirled his moustache, spitting into the"
433,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,garden.
434,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
435,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,And he knew nothing about what happened until he found himself in the
436,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"shrubbery, crawling toward the corral, through the dusk and the dampness"
437,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"of the leaves, carrying his cane, making sure of his hat, looking up at"
438,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,the stars.
439,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
440,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Now he knew why he had come. He was with his horses again. His eyes,"
441,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"pressed against the bars, stared in. The black stallion in the lead had"
442,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"been his special pet, a rough animal, but kindly, knowing. And here they"
443,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"were once more, tearing up the grass, galloping about in the night like"
444,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"a ball-room full of real people, people who wanted to do things, who did"
445,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,what they wanted to do.
446,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
447,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"He began to crawl through the bars, slowly, deftly, and when half way"
448,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"through he paused, thinking."
449,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
450,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Presently he went on again, and drawing himself into the corral, his hat"
451,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"and cane thrown in before him, he lay there mouth to the grass."
452,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
453,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"They were still running, but less madly; one of them had gone up the"
454,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Willow Road leading into a farther pasture, in a flare of dust, through"
455,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,which it looked immense and faint.
456,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
457,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"On the top of the hill three or four of the horses were standing,"
458,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"testing the weather. He would mount one, he would ride away, he would"
459,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"escape. And his horses, the things he knew, would be his escape."
460,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
461,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Bareback, he thought, would be like the days when he had taken what he"
462,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"could from the rush of the streets, joy, exhilaration, life, and he was"
463,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"not afraid. He wanted to stand up, to cry aloud."
464,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
465,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"And he saw ten or twelve of them rounding the curb, and he did stand up."
466,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
467,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"They did not seem to know him, did not seem to know what to make of him,"
468,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,and he stared at them wondering. He did not think of his white shirt
469,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"front, his sudden arising, the darkness, their excitement. Surely they"
470,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"would know, in a moment more."
471,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
472,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"Wheeling, flaring their wet nostrils, throwing up their manes, striking"
473,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"the earth in a quandary, they came on, whinnied faintly, and he knew"
474,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,what it was to be afraid.
475,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
476,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,He had never been afraid and he went down on his knees. With a new
477,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"horror in his heart he damned them. He turned his eyes up, but he could"
478,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"not open them. He thought rapidly, calling on Freda in his heart,"
479,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"speaking tenderly, promising."
480,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
481,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,A flare of heat passed his throat and descended into his bosom.
482,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
483,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"“I want to live. I can do it—damn it—I can do it! I can forge ahead,"
484,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,make my mark.”
485,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
486,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,He forgot where he was for a moment and found new pleasure in this
487,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"spoken admission, this new rebellion. He moved with the faint shaking of"
488,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"the earth, like a child on a woman’s lap."
489,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
490,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"The upraised hoofs of the first horse missed him, but the second did"
491,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,not.
492,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,
493,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"And presently the horses drew apart, nibbling here and there, switching"
494,A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES,"their tails, avoiding a patch of tall grass."

996,THE VALET,
997,THE VALET,"The fields about Louis-Georges’ house grew green in early Spring,"
998,THE VALET,"leaving the surrounding country in melancholy grey, for Louis-Georges"
999,THE VALET,was the only man who sowed his ground to rye.
1000,THE VALET,
1001,THE VALET,"Louis-Georges was of small stature. His face was oblong, too pale. A dry"
1002,THE VALET,mouth lay crookedly beneath a nose ending in a slight bulb. His long
1003,THE VALET,animal-like arms swung half a rhythm ahead of his legs.
1004,THE VALET,
1005,THE VALET,"He prided himself on his farming, though he knew nothing about it. He"
1006,THE VALET,"surveyed the tender coming green with kindly good nature, his acres were"
1007,THE VALET,always a month ahead of his neighbours’.
1008,THE VALET,
1009,THE VALET,"Sometimes standing in the doorway, breathing through the thick hair in"
1010,THE VALET,"his nostrils, stretching his gloves, he would look at the low-lying"
1011,THE VALET,"sheds and the stables and the dull brown patches of ploughed earth, and"
1012,THE VALET,"mutter, “Splendid, splendid!”"
1013,THE VALET,
1014,THE VALET,"Finally he would stroll in among the cattle where, in dizzy circles,"
1015,THE VALET,"large coloured flies swayed, emitting a soft insistent drone, like"
1016,THE VALET,taffeta rubbed against taffeta.
1017,THE VALET,
1018,THE VALET,He liked to think that he knew a great deal about horses. He would look
1019,THE VALET,"solemnly at the trainer and discuss length of neck, thinness and shape"
1020,THE VALET,"of flank by the hour, stroking the hocks of his pet racer. Sometimes he"
1021,THE VALET,would say to Vera Sovna: “There’s more real breeding in the rump of a
1022,THE VALET,mare than in all the crowned heads of England.”
1023,THE VALET,
1024,THE VALET,"Sometimes he and Vera Sovna would play in the hay, and about the grain"
1025,THE VALET,"bins. She in her long flounces, leaping in and out, screaming and"
1026,THE VALET,"laughing, stamping her high heels, setting up a great commotion among"
1027,THE VALET,her ruffles.
1028,THE VALET,
1029,THE VALET,"Once Louis-Georges caught a rat, bare-handed, and with such skill that"
1030,THE VALET,it could not bite. He disguised his pride in showing it to her by
1031,THE VALET,pretending that he had done so to inform her of the rodent menace to
1032,THE VALET,Winter grain.
1033,THE VALET,
1034,THE VALET,Vera Sovna was a tall creature with thin shoulders; she was always
1035,THE VALET,shrugging them as if her shoulder-blades were heavy. She dressed in
1036,THE VALET,black and laughed a good deal in a very high key.
1037,THE VALET,
1038,THE VALET,"She had been a great friend of Louis-Georges’ mother, but since her"
1039,THE VALET,death she had fallen into disrepute. It was hinted that she was
1040,THE VALET,“something” to Louis-Georges; and when the townsfolk and neighbouring
1041,THE VALET,landholders saw her enter the house they would not content themselves
1042,THE VALET,until they saw her leave it.
1043,THE VALET,
1044,THE VALET,"If she came out holding her skirts crookedly above her thin ankles, they"
1045,THE VALET,"would find the roofs of their mouths in sudden disapproval, while if she"
1046,THE VALET,"walked slowly, dragging her dress, they would say: “See what a dust Vera"
1047,THE VALET,Sovna brings up in the driveway; she stamps as if she were a mare.”
1048,THE VALET,
1049,THE VALET,"If she knew anything of this feeling, she never showed it. She would"
1050,THE VALET,drive through the town and turn neither to right nor left until she
1051,THE VALET,"passed the markets with their bright yellow gourds and squashes, their"
1052,THE VALET,"rosy apples and their splendid tomatoes, exhaling an odour of decaying"
1053,THE VALET,"sunlight. On the rare occasions when Louis-Georges accompanied her, she"
1054,THE VALET,"would cross her legs at the knee, leaning forward, pointing a finger at"
1055,THE VALET,"him, shaking her head, laughing."
1056,THE VALET,
1057,THE VALET,Sometimes she would go into the maids’ quarters to play with Leah’s
1058,THE VALET,"child, a little creature with weak legs and neck, who always thrust out"
1059,THE VALET,his stomach for her to pat.
1060,THE VALET,
1061,THE VALET,"The maids, Berthe and Leah, were well-built complacent women with serene"
1062,THE VALET,"blue eyes, quite far apart, and good mouths in which fine teeth grew"
1063,THE VALET,gratefully and upon whom round ample busts flourished like plants. They
1064,THE VALET,went about their work singing or chewing long green salad leaves.
1065,THE VALET,
1066,THE VALET,In her youth Leah had done something for which she prayed at intervals.
1067,THE VALET,Her memory was always taking her hastily away to kneel before the gaudy
1068,THE VALET,wax Christ that hung on a beam in the barn. Resting her head against the
1069,THE VALET,"boards she would lift her work-worn hands, bosom-high, sighing, praying,"
1070,THE VALET,murmuring.
1071,THE VALET,
1072,THE VALET,"Or she would help Berthe with the milking, throwing her thick ankles"
1073,THE VALET,"under the cow’s udders, bringing down a sudden fury of milk, shining and"
1074,THE VALET,"splashing over her big clean knuckles, saying quietly, evenly:"
1075,THE VALET,
1076,THE VALET,“I think we will have rain before dawn.”
1077,THE VALET,
1078,THE VALET,"And her sister would answer: “Yes, before dawn.”"
1079,THE VALET,
1080,THE VALET,"Leah would spend hours in the garden, her little one crawling after her,"
1081,THE VALET,"leaving childish smears on the dusty leaves of the growing corn, digging"
1082,THE VALET,"his hands into the vegetable tops, falling and pretending to have fallen"
1083,THE VALET,on purpose; grinning up at the sun foolishly until his eyes watered.
1084,THE VALET,
1085,THE VALET,"These two women and Louis-Georges’ valet, Vanka, made up the household,"
1086,THE VALET,"saving occasional visits from Louis-Georges’ aunts, Myra and Ella."
1087,THE VALET,
1088,THE VALET,"This man Vanka was a mixture of Russian and Jew. He bit his nails,"
1089,THE VALET,"talked of the revolution, moved clumsily."
1090,THE VALET,
1091,THE VALET,"His clothes fitted him badly, he pomaded his hair, which was reddish"
1092,THE VALET,"yellow, pulled out the short hairs that tormented his throat, and from"
1093,THE VALET,beneath his white brows distributed a kindly intelligent look. The most
1094,THE VALET,"painful thing about him was his attempt to seem alert, his effort to"
1095,THE VALET,keep pace with his master.
1096,THE VALET,
1097,THE VALET,"Louis-Georges would say, “Well now, Vanka, what did they do to you in"
1098,THE VALET,Russia when you were a boy?”
1099,THE VALET,
1100,THE VALET,"“They shot my brother for a red,” Vanka would answer, pulling the hairs."
1101,THE VALET,"“They threw him into prison, and my sister took him his food. One day"
1102,THE VALET,"our father was also arrested, then she took two dinner pails instead of"
1103,THE VALET,"one. Once she heard a noise, it sounded like a shot, and our father"
1104,THE VALET,returned her one of the pails. They say he looked up at her like a man
1105,THE VALET,"who is gazed at over the shoulder.” He had told the tale often, adding:"
1106,THE VALET,"“My sister became almost bald later on, yet she was a handsome woman;"
1107,THE VALET,the students used to come to her chambers to hear her talk.”
1108,THE VALET,
1109,THE VALET,At such times Louis-Georges would excuse himself and shut himself up to
1110,THE VALET,"write, in a large and scrawling hand, letters to his aunts with some of"
1111,THE VALET,Vanka’s phrases in them.
1112,THE VALET,
1113,THE VALET,"Sometimes Vera Sovna would come in to watch him, lifting her ruffles,"
1114,THE VALET,"raising her brows. Too, she would turn and look for a long time at Vanka"
1115,THE VALET,"who returned her look with cold persistence, the way of a man who is"
1116,THE VALET,"afraid, who does not approve, and yet who likes."
1117,THE VALET,
1118,THE VALET,"She would stand with her back to the fireplace, her high heels a little"
1119,THE VALET,"apart, tapping the stretched silk of her skirt, saying:"
1120,THE VALET,
1121,THE VALET,"“You will ruin your eyes,” adding: “Vanka, won’t you stop him?”"
1122,THE VALET,
1123,THE VALET,"She seldom got answers to her remarks. Louis-Georges would continue,"
1124,THE VALET,"grunting at her, to be sure, and smiling, but never lifting his eyes:"
1125,THE VALET,"and as for Vanka he would stand there, catching the sheets of paper as"
1126,THE VALET,they were finished.
1127,THE VALET,
1128,THE VALET,"Finally Louis-Georges would push back his chair, saying: “Come, we will"
1129,THE VALET,have tea.”
1130,THE VALET,
1131,THE VALET,"In the end he fell into a slow illness. It attacked his limbs, he was"
1132,THE VALET,"forced to walk with a cane. He complained of his heart, but he persisted"
1133,THE VALET,"in going out to look at the horses, to the barn to amuse Vera Sovna,"
1134,THE VALET,"swaying a little as he watched the slow-circling flies, sniffing the"
1135,THE VALET,pleasant odours of cow’s milk and dung.
1136,THE VALET,
1137,THE VALET,"He still had plans for the haying season, for his crops, but he gave"
1138,THE VALET,"them over to his farm hands, who, left to themselves, wandered aimlessly"
1139,THE VALET,home at odd hours.
1140,THE VALET,
1141,THE VALET,About six months later he took to his bed.
1142,THE VALET,
1143,THE VALET,"His aunts came, testing with their withered noses the smell of decaying"
1144,THE VALET,"wood and paregoric, whispering that “he never used to get like this.”"
1145,THE VALET,
1146,THE VALET,Raising their ample shoulders to ease the little black velvet straps
1147,THE VALET,"that sunk into their flesh, they sat on either side of his bed."
1148,THE VALET,
1149,THE VALET,They looked at each other in a pitifully surprised way. They had never
1150,THE VALET,"seen illness, and death but once—a suicide, and this they understood:"
1151,THE VALET,"one has impulses, but not maladies."
1152,THE VALET,
1153,THE VALET,They were afraid of meeting Vera Sovna. Their position was a difficult
1154,THE VALET,"one; having been on friendly terms while Louis-Georges’ mother lived,"
1155,THE VALET,they had nevertheless to maintain a certain dignity and reserve when the
1156,THE VALET,very townsfolk had turned against her. Therefore they left her an hour
1157,THE VALET,"in the evening to herself. She would come creeping in, saying:"
1158,THE VALET,
1159,THE VALET,"“Oh, my dear,” telling him long unheard stories about a week she had"
1160,THE VALET,"spent in London. A curious week, full of near adventure, with amusing"
1161,THE VALET,"tales of hotel keepers, nobility. And sometimes leaning close to him,"
1162,THE VALET,"that he might hear, he saw that she was weeping."
1163,THE VALET,
1164,THE VALET,"But in spite of this and of his illness and the new quality in the air,"
1165,THE VALET,Vera Sovna was strangely gay.
1166,THE VALET,
1167,THE VALET,"During this illness the two girls served as nurses, changing the sheets,"
1168,THE VALET,"turning him over, rubbing him with alcohol, bringing him his soup,"
1169,THE VALET,crossing themselves.
1170,THE VALET,
1171,THE VALET,Vanka stood long hours by the bedside coughing. Sometimes he would fall
1172,THE VALET,"off into sleep, at others he would try to talk of the revolution."
1173,THE VALET,
1174,THE VALET,"Vera Sovna had taken to dining in the kitchen, a long bare room that"
1175,THE VALET,pleased her. From the window one could see the orchards and the pump and
1176,THE VALET,the long slope down to the edge of the meadow. And the room was pleasant
1177,THE VALET,"to look upon. The table, like the earth itself, was simple and abundant."
1178,THE VALET,"It might have been a meadow that Leah and Berthe browsed in,"
1179,THE VALET,"red-cheeked, gaining health, strength."
1180,THE VALET,
1181,THE VALET,"Great hams, smoked fowl with oddly taut legs hung from the beams, and"
1182,THE VALET,under these the girls moved as if there were some bond between them.
1183,THE VALET,
1184,THE VALET,"They accepted Vera Sovna’s company cheerfully, uncomplainingly, and when"
1185,THE VALET,"she went away they cleared up her crumbs, thinking and talking of other"
1186,THE VALET,"things, forgetting."
1187,THE VALET,
1188,THE VALET,Nothing suffered on account of his illness. The household matters went
1189,THE VALET,"smoothly, the crops ripened, the haying season passed, and the sod in"
1190,THE VALET,the orchards sounded with the thud of ripe falling fruit. Louis-Georges
1191,THE VALET,"suffered alone, detached, as if he had never been. Even about Vera Sovna"
1192,THE VALET,"there was a strange quiet brilliancy, the brilliancy of one who is about"
1193,THE VALET,"to receive something. She caressed the medicine bottles, tended the"
1194,THE VALET,flowers.
1195,THE VALET,
1196,THE VALET,"Leah and Berthe were unperturbed, except from overwork; the face of"
1197,THE VALET,Vanka alone changed.
1198,THE VALET,
1199,THE VALET,He bore the expression at once of a man in pain and of a man who is
1200,THE VALET,about to come into peace. The flickering light in Louis-Georges’ face
1201,THE VALET,cast its shadow on that of his valet.
1202,THE VALET,
1203,THE VALET,Myra and Ella became gradually excited. They kept brushing imaginary
1204,THE VALET,"specks of dust from their shoulders and bodices, sending each other in"
1205,THE VALET,"to observe him. They comforted themselves looking at him, pretending"
1206,THE VALET,each to the other that he was quite improved. It was not so much that
1207,THE VALET,"they were sorry to have him die, as it was that they were not prepared"
1208,THE VALET,to have him die.
1209,THE VALET,
1210,THE VALET,When the doctor arrived they shifted their burden of worry. They bought
1211,THE VALET,"medicine with great relish, hurriedly. Finally to lessen the torment"
1212,THE VALET,"they closed their eyes as they sat on either side of his bed, picturing"
1213,THE VALET,"him already dead, laid out, hands crossed, that they might gain comfort"
1214,THE VALET,"upon opening them, to find him still alive."
1215,THE VALET,
1216,THE VALET,When they knew that he was really dying they could not keep from
1217,THE VALET,touching him. They tried to cover him up in those parts that exposed too
1218,THE VALET,"plainly his illness: the thin throat, the damp pulsing spot in the neck."
1219,THE VALET,"They fondled his hands, driving doctor and nurse into a passion."
1220,THE VALET,
1221,THE VALET,"At last, in desperation, Myra knelt by his bed, touched his face,"
1222,THE VALET,"stroked his cheeks, trying to break the monotonous calm of approaching"
1223,THE VALET,death.
1224,THE VALET,
1225,THE VALET,Death did not seem to be anywhere in him saving in his face ... it
1226,THE VALET,seemed to Myra that to drive it from his eyes would mean life. It was
1227,THE VALET,"then that she and her sister were locked out, to wander up and down the"
1228,THE VALET,"hall, afraid to speak, afraid to weep, unless by that much they might"
1229,THE VALET,hasten his death.
1230,THE VALET,
1231,THE VALET,"When he finally died, they had the problem of Vera Sovna."
1232,THE VALET,
1233,THE VALET,"But they soon forgot her, trying to follow the orders left by the dead"
1234,THE VALET,man. Louis-Georges had been very careful to see to it that things should
1235,THE VALET,"go on growing; he had given many orders, planned new seasons, talked of"
1236,THE VALET,"“next year,” knowing that he would not be there."
1237,THE VALET,
1238,THE VALET,"The hens cackled with splendid performances, the stables resounded with"
1239,THE VALET,"the good spirits of the horses, the fields were all but shedding their"
1240,THE VALET,"very life on the earth as Vanka moved noiselessly about, folding the"
1241,THE VALET,dead man’s clothes.
1242,THE VALET,
1243,THE VALET,When the undertaker arrived Vanka would not let him touch the body. He
1244,THE VALET,washed and dressed it to suit himself. It was he who laid Louis-Georges
1245,THE VALET,"in the shiny coffin, it was he who arranged the flowers, and he who"
1246,THE VALET,finally left the room on the flat of his whole noisy feet for the first
1247,THE VALET,time in years. He went to his own room overlooking the garden.
1248,THE VALET,
1249,THE VALET,He paced the room. It seemed to him that he had left something undone.
1250,THE VALET,He had loved service and order; he did not know that he also loved
1251,THE VALET,"Louis-Georges, who made service necessary and order desirable."
1252,THE VALET,
1253,THE VALET,"This distressed him, he rubbed his hands, holding them close to his"
1254,THE VALET,"mouth, as if by the sound of one hand passing over the other he might"
1255,THE VALET,learn some secret in the stoppage of sound.
1256,THE VALET,
1257,THE VALET,"Leah had made a scene, he thought of that. A small enough scene,"
1258,THE VALET,"considering. She had brought her baby in, dropping him beside the body,"
1259,THE VALET,giving the flat-voiced: “Now you can play with him a minute.”
1260,THE VALET,
1261,THE VALET,"He had not interfered, the child had been too frightened to disturb the"
1262,THE VALET,"cold excellence of Louis-Georges’ arrangement, and Leah had gone out"
1263,THE VALET,"soon enough in stolid silence. He could hear them descending the steps,"
1264,THE VALET,her heavy slow tread followed by the quick uneven movements of the
1265,THE VALET,child.
1266,THE VALET,
1267,THE VALET,"Vanka could hear the rustling of the trees in the garden, the call of an"
1268,THE VALET,"owl from the barn; one of the mares whinnied and, stamping, fell off"
1269,THE VALET,into silence.
1270,THE VALET,
1271,THE VALET,He opened the window. He thought he caught the sound of feet on the
1272,THE VALET,"pebbles that bordered the hydrangea bushes; a faint perfume, such as the"
1273,THE VALET,"flounces of Vera Sovna exhaled, came to him. Irritated, he turned away,"
1274,THE VALET,when he heard her calling.
1275,THE VALET,
1276,THE VALET,"“Vanka, come, my foot is caught in the vine.”"
1277,THE VALET,
1278,THE VALET,"Her face, with wide hanging lips, came above the sill, and the same"
1279,THE VALET,moment she jumped into the room.
1280,THE VALET,
1281,THE VALET,They stood looking at each other. They had never been alone together
1282,THE VALET,before. He did not know what to do.
1283,THE VALET,
1284,THE VALET,"She was a little dishevelled, twigs from the shrubbery clung to the"
1285,THE VALET,"black flounces of her gown. She raised her thin shoulders once, twice,"
1286,THE VALET,and sighed.
1287,THE VALET,
1288,THE VALET,"She reached out her arm, whispering:"
1289,THE VALET,
1290,THE VALET,“Vanka.”
1291,THE VALET,
1292,THE VALET,"He moved away from her, staring at her."
1293,THE VALET,
1294,THE VALET,"“Vanka,” she repeated, and came close, leaning a little on him."
1295,THE VALET,
1296,THE VALET,"In a voice of command, she said simply, “You must tell me something.”"
1297,THE VALET,
1298,THE VALET,"“I will tell you,” he answered, automatically."
1299,THE VALET,
1300,THE VALET,"“See, look at your hands——” She kissed them suddenly, dropping her wet"
1301,THE VALET,"lips into the middle of the palms, making him start and shiver."
1302,THE VALET,
1303,THE VALET,"“Look at these eyes—ah, fortunate man,” she continued, “most fortunate"
1304,THE VALET,"Vanka; he would let you touch him, close, near the heart, the skin. You"
1305,THE VALET,"could know what he looked like, how he stood, how his ankle went into"
1306,THE VALET,his foot.” He ceased to hear her.
1307,THE VALET,
1308,THE VALET,"“And his shoulders, how they set. You dressed and undressed him, knew"
1309,THE VALET,"him, all of him, for many years—you see, you understand? Tell me, tell"
1310,THE VALET,me what he was like!”
1311,THE VALET,
1312,THE VALET,"He turned to her. “I will tell you,” he said, “if you are still, if you"
1313,THE VALET,"will sit down, if you are quiet.”"
1314,THE VALET,
1315,THE VALET,"She sat down with another sigh, with a touch of her old gaiety; she"
1316,THE VALET,"raised her eyes, watching him."
1317,THE VALET,
1318,THE VALET,"“His arms were too long, you could tell that—but beautiful, and his back"
1319,THE VALET,"was thin, tapering—full of breeding——”"

1347,HUCKSTEPPE    │,_About this room there is perhaps just a little too much of a certain

1430,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"skirts, but she knows how to move her feet without kicking up a dust—a"
1431,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"woman who can do that, drives a man mad.” In town there’s a story that"
1432,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"you come through once every Spring, driving a different man ahead of you"
1433,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"with a riding whip; another has it, that you come in the night——"
1434,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1435,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—In other words, the starved women of the town are beginning to"
1436,HUCKSTEPPE    │,eat.
1437,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1438,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_Pause._] Well [_laughs_] I like you.
1439,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1440,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—I do not enjoy the spectacle of men ascending.
1441,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1442,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—What are you trying to say?
1443,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1444,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—I’m saying it.
1445,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1446,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_After an awkward pause._] Do—you wish me to—go away?
1447,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1448,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—You will go.
1449,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1450,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Why won’t you let me talk to you?
1451,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1452,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Any man may accomplish anything he’s capable of.
1453,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1454,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Do you know how I feel about you?
1455,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1456,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Perfectly.
1457,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1458,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I have heard many things about your—your past—— I believe none of
1459,HUCKSTEPPE    │,them——
1460,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1461,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Quite right, why should you mix trades?"
1462,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1463,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—What do you mean by that?
1464,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1465,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Why confuse incapability with accomplishment——
1466,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1467,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—It’s strange to see a woman like you turning to the merely
1468,HUCKSTEPPE    │,bitter——
1469,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1470,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—I began beyond bitterness.
1471,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1472,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Why do you treat me this way?
1473,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1474,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—How would you have me treat you?
1475,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1476,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—There was one night when you seemed to know, have you forgotten? A"
1477,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"storm was coming up, the clouds were rolling overhead—and you, you"
1478,HUCKSTEPPE    │,yourself started it. You kissed me.
1479,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1480,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—You say it was about to storm?
1481,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1482,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Yes.
1483,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1484,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—It even looked like rain?
1485,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1486,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Yes.
1487,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1488,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—[_Quickly in a different voice._] It was a dark night, and I"
1489,HUCKSTEPPE    │,ended it.
1490,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1491,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—What have I done?
1492,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1493,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—You have neglected to make any beginning in the world—can I help
1494,HUCKSTEPPE    │,that?
1495,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1496,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I offer you a clean heart.
1497,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1498,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Things which have known only one state, do not interest me."
1499,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1500,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Helena!
1501,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1502,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Gheid Storm.
1503,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1504,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—I have a son; I don’t know why I should tell you about him,"
1505,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"perhaps because I want to prove that I have lived, and perhaps not. My"
1506,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"son is a child, I am a man of few years and my son is like what I was at"
1507,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"his age. He is thin, I was thin; he is quiet, I was quiet; he has"
1508,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"delicate flesh, and I had also—well, then his mother died——"
1509,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1510,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—The saddle comes down from the horse.
1511,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1512,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—Well, she died——"
1513,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1514,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—And that’s over.
1515,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1516,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—Well, there it is, I have a son——"
1517,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1518,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—And that’s not over. Do you resent that?
1519,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1520,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—I don’t know, perhaps. Sometimes I say to myself when I’m sitting"
1521,HUCKSTEPPE    │,by the fire alone—“You should have something to think of while sitting
1522,HUCKSTEPPE    │,here——”
1523,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1524,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—In other words, you’re living for the sake of your fire."
1525,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1526,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_To himself._] Some day I shall be glad I knew you.
1527,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1528,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—You go rather fast.
1529,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1530,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—Yes, I shall have you to think of."
1531,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1532,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—When the fire is hot, you’ll be glad to think of me?"
1533,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1534,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—Yes, all of us like to have a few things to tell to our children,"
1535,HUCKSTEPPE    │,and I have always shown all that’s in my heart to my son.
1536,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1537,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—How horrible!
1538,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1539,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_Startled._] Why?
1540,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1541,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Would you show everything that made your heart?
1542,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1543,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I believe in frankness——
1544,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1545,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—[_With something like anger._] Well, some day your son will blow"
1546,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"his head off, to be rid of frankness, before his skin is tough."
1547,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1548,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—You are not making anything easier.
1549,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1550,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—I’ve never been callous enough to make things easier.
1551,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1552,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—You’re a queer woman——
1553,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1554,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Yes, that does describe me."
1555,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1556,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_Taking his leg off the table._] Do you really want to know why I
1557,HUCKSTEPPE    │,came? Because I need you——
1558,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1559,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—I’m not interested in corruption for the many.
1560,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1561,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_Starting as if he had been struck._] By God!
1562,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1563,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Nor in misplaced satisfactions——
1564,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1565,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—By God, what a woman!"
1566,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1567,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Nor do I participate in liberations——
1568,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1569,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_In a low voice._] I could hate you!
1570,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1571,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—I limit no man, feel what you can."
1572,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1573,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—[_Taking a step toward her, the dog lifts its head._] If it were"
1574,HUCKSTEPPE    │,not for those damned dogs of yours—I’d—I’d——
1575,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1576,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Aristocracy of movement never made a dog bite——
1577,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1578,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—That’s a—strange thing to say—just at this moment.
1579,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1580,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Not for me.
1581,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1582,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—[_Sulky._] Well, anyway, a cat may look at a King——"
1583,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1584,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Oh no, a cat may only look at what it sees."
1585,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1586,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Helena Hucksteppe.
1587,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1588,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Yes.
1589,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1590,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I’m—attracted—to you.
1591,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1592,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—A magnet does not attract shavings.
1593,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1594,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_With positive conviction._] I _could_ hate you.
1595,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1596,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—I choose my enemies.
1597,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1598,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—[_Without warning, seizing her._] By God, at least I can kiss you!"
1599,HUCKSTEPPE    │,[_He kisses her full on the mouth—she makes no resistance._]
1600,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1601,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—[_In a calm voice._] And this, I suppose, is what you call the"
1602,HUCKSTEPPE    │,“great moment of human contact.”
1603,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1604,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_Dropping his arms—turning pale._] What are you trying to do to
1605,HUCKSTEPPE    │,me?
1606,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1607,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—I’m doing it.
1608,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1609,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_To himself._] Yet it was you that I wanted——
1610,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1611,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Mongrels may not dig up buried treasure.
1612,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1613,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—[_In a sudden rage._] You can bury your past as deep as you like,"
1614,HUCKSTEPPE    │,but carrion will out!
1615,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1616,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—[_Softly._] And this is love.
1617,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1618,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—[_His head in his arms._] Oh, God, God!"
1619,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1620,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—And you who like the taste of new things, come to me?"
1621,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1622,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_In a lost voice._] Shall I have no joy?
1623,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1624,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Joy? Oh, yes, of a kind."
1625,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1626,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—And you—are angry with me?
1627,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1628,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—In the study of science, is the scientist angry when the fly"
1629,HUCKSTEPPE    │,possesses no amusing phenomena?
1630,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1631,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I wanted—to know—you——
1632,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1633,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—I am conscious of your failure.
1634,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1635,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I wanted something—some sign——
1636,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1637,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Must I, who have spent my whole life in being myself, go out of"
1638,HUCKSTEPPE    │,my way to change some look in you?
1639,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1640,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—That’s why you are so terrible, you have spent all your life on"
1641,HUCKSTEPPE    │,yourself.
1642,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1643,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Yes, men do resent that in women."
1644,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1645,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—Yes, I suppose so. [_Pause._] I should have liked to talk"
1646,HUCKSTEPPE    │,of—myself——
1647,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1648,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—You see I could not listen.
1649,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1650,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—You are—intolerant.
1651,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1652,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—No—occupied——
1653,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1654,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—You are probably—playing a game.
1655,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1656,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—[_With a gracious smile._] You will get some personal good out of
1657,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"it, won’t you?"
1658,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1659,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I’m uncomfortable——
1660,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1661,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Uncomfortable!
1662,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1663,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_Beginning to be really uncomfortable._] Who _are_ you?
1664,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1665,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—I am a woman, Gheid Storm, who is _not_ in need."
1666,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1667,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—You’re horrible!
1668,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1669,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Yes, that too."
1670,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1671,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—But somewhere you’re vulnerable.
1672,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1673,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Perhaps.
1674,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1675,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Only I don’t quite know the spot.
1676,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1677,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Spot?
1678,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1679,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—Something, somewhere, hidden——"
1680,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1681,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Hidden! [_She laughs._] _All_ of me is vulnerable.
1682,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1683,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_Setting his teeth._] You tempt me.
1684,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1685,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—[_Wearily._] It’s not that kind.
1686,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1687,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I’ve lain awake thinking of you—many nights.
1688,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1689,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—That is too bad.
1690,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1691,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—What is too bad?
1692,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1693,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—That you have had—fancies.
1694,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1695,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Why?
1696,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1697,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Theft of much, makes much to return——"
1698,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1699,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—The world allows a man his own thoughts.
1700,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1701,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Oh, no——"
1702,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1703,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—At least my thoughts are my own.
1704,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1705,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Not one, so far."
1706,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1707,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—What does that mean?
1708,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1709,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—You’ll know when you try to think them again.
1710,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1711,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—You mean I’m not making headway—well, you’re right, I’m not——"
1712,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1713,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Now tell me what brought you through the window.
1714,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1715,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—[_Relieved._] I’m glad you ask that, it’s the first human thing"
1716,HUCKSTEPPE    │,that’s happened this afternoon.
1717,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1718,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—You have forgotten our great moment of human contact.
1719,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1720,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_Nervously._] Well——
1721,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1722,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—You were about to tell me what brought you?
1723,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1724,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I don’t know—something no one speaks of—some great ease in your
1725,HUCKSTEPPE    │,back—the look of a great lover——
1726,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1727,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—So—you scented a great lover——
1728,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1729,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I am a man—and I love——
1730,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1731,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—What have you done for love, Gheid Storm?"
1732,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1733,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I’ve—never gone to the dogs——
1734,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1735,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—So?
1736,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1737,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I’ve always respected women.
1738,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1739,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—In other words: taken the coals out of the fire with the
1740,HUCKSTEPPE    │,poker—continue——
1741,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1742,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—That’s all.
1743,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1744,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—And you dared to come to me! [_Her entire manner has changed._]
1745,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1746,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—No matter what you’ve been—done—I love you.
1747,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1748,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Do not come so near. Only those who have helped to make such
1749,HUCKSTEPPE    │,death as mine may go a little way toward the ardours of that decay.
1750,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1751,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—What have I done?
1752,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1753,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—You have dared to bring to a woman, who has known love, the"
1754,HUCKSTEPPE    │,whinny of a pauper.
1755,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1756,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—What am I?
1757,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1758,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—[_Softly, to herself._] How sensitively the handles cling to the"
1759,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"vase, how delicate is the flesh between the fingers."
1760,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1761,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I—I don’t know you.
1762,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1763,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—[_Dropping her hands to her sides._] Come here, Gheid"
1764,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"Storm—[_Gheid approaches slowly, like a sleep walker_]. Put your hand on"

1766,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"then into his face, making it quite plain that he does not even know how"
1767,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"to touch a woman._] Yet you would be my lover, knowing not one touch"
1768,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"that is mine, nor one word that is mine. My house is for men who have"
1769,HUCKSTEPPE    │,done their stumbling.
1770,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1771,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_In an inaudible voice._] I am going now——
1772,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1773,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—I cannot touch new things, nor see beginnings."
1774,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1775,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Helena! Helena!
1776,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1777,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Do not call my name. There are too many names that must be called
1778,HUCKSTEPPE    │,before mine.
1779,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1780,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—Shall I die, and never have known you?"
1781,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1782,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Death, for you, will begin where my cradle started rocking——"
1783,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1784,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Shall I have no love like yours?
1785,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1786,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—When I am an old woman, thinking of other things, you will,"
1787,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"perhaps, be kissing a woman like me——"
1788,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1789,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_Moving blindly toward the door._] Now I am going.
1790,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1791,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—[_In a quiet, level voice._] The fall is almost here."
1792,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1793,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—Yes, it’s almost here."
1794,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1795,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—The leaves on the mountain road are turning yellow.
1796,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1797,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"STORM—Yes, the leaves are turning."
1798,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1799,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—It’s late, your son will be waiting dinner for you."
1800,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1801,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Don’t take everything away.
1802,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1803,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—You will not even recall having seen me.
1804,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1805,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Can memory be taken too?
1806,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1807,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Only that memory that goes past recollection may be kept.
1808,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1809,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—[_At the door._] Good night——
1810,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1811,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—[_Smiling._] There is the window.
1812,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1813,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—I could not lift my legs now.
1814,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1815,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—That’s a memory you may keep.
1816,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1817,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—Good night.
1818,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1819,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Good-bye, Gheid Storm, and as you go down the hill, will you lock"
1820,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"the gate, a dog thief passed in the night, taking my terrier with him."
1821,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1822,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—The one with the brown spots?
1823,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1824,HUCKSTEPPE    │,HELENA—Yes.
1825,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1826,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—That was a fine dog.
1827,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1828,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Yes, she was a fine dog—restless."
1829,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1830,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—They say any dog will follow any man who carries aniseed.
1831,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1832,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Well, soon I return to the city."
1833,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1834,HUCKSTEPPE    │,STORM—You look tired.
1835,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1836,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"HELENA—Yes, I am tired."
1837,HUCKSTEPPE    │,
1838,HUCKSTEPPE    │,"[_Gheid exits. Helena takes her old position, her back almost square to"
1839,HUCKSTEPPE    │,the audience._]

1850,BEYOND THE END,
1851,BEYOND THE END,
1852,BEYOND THE END,"Behind two spanking horses, in the heat of noon, rode Julie Anspacher."
1853,BEYOND THE END,"The air was full of the sound of windlasses and well water, where, from"
1854,BEYOND THE END,"cool abysses, heavy buckets arose; and, too, the air was full of the"
1855,BEYOND THE END,"perfect odour of small flowers. And Julie turned her head, gazing at the"
1856,BEYOND THE END,familiar line of road that ran away into the still more familiar
1857,BEYOND THE END,distance.
1858,BEYOND THE END,
1859,BEYOND THE END,"The driver, a Scandinavian, who remembered one folk-tale involving a"
1860,BEYOND THE END,"partridge and one popular song involving a woman, sat stiffly on his box"
1861,BEYOND THE END,holding the reins gently over the shining and sleek backs of the two
1862,BEYOND THE END,mares.
1863,BEYOND THE END,
1864,BEYOND THE END,"He began to whistle the popular song now, swinging a little on his"
1865,BEYOND THE END,"sturdy base, and drifting back with his tune came the tang of horse"
1866,BEYOND THE END,"skin, wet beneath tight leather."
1867,BEYOND THE END,
1868,BEYOND THE END,"The horses were taking the hill, straining and moving their ears, and"
1869,BEYOND THE END,"reaching the top, bounded forward in a whirl of dust. Still sitting"
1870,BEYOND THE END,"rigid, the driver clucked, snapping his whip, and began talking in a dry"
1871,BEYOND THE END,deep bass.
1872,BEYOND THE END,
1873,BEYOND THE END,"“It’s some time since we have seen you, Mrs. Anspacher.”"
1874,BEYOND THE END,
1875,BEYOND THE END,Julie raised her thin long face from her collar and nodded.
1876,BEYOND THE END,
1877,BEYOND THE END,"“Yes,” she answered in a short voice, and frowned."
1878,BEYOND THE END,
1879,BEYOND THE END,"“Your husband has gathered in the corn already, and the orchards are"
1880,BEYOND THE END,hanging heavy.”
1881,BEYOND THE END,
1882,BEYOND THE END,"“Are they?” she said, and tried to remember how many trees there were of"
1883,BEYOND THE END,apple and of pear.
1884,BEYOND THE END,
1885,BEYOND THE END,"The driver took in another foot of reins, and turning slightly around,"
1886,BEYOND THE END,"so that he could look at her, said:"
1887,BEYOND THE END,
1888,BEYOND THE END,"“It’s good to see you again, Mrs. Anspacher.”"
1889,BEYOND THE END,
1890,BEYOND THE END,"She began to laugh. “Is it?” then with deliberation checked herself, and"
1891,BEYOND THE END,fixed her angry eyes straight ahead of her.
1892,BEYOND THE END,
1893,BEYOND THE END,"The child, loose-limbed with excessive youth, who sat at her side,"
1894,BEYOND THE END,lifted a small sharp face on which an aquiline nose perched with comic
1895,BEYOND THE END,"boldness. She half held, half dropped an old-fashioned ermine muff, the"
1896,BEYOND THE END,tails of which stuck out in all directions. She looked unhappy and
1897,BEYOND THE END,expectant.
1898,BEYOND THE END,
1899,BEYOND THE END,“You remember Mrs. Berling?” he went on. “She is married again.”
1900,BEYOND THE END,
1901,BEYOND THE END,“Is she?”
1902,BEYOND THE END,
1903,BEYOND THE END,"“Yes, ma’am.”"
1904,BEYOND THE END,
1905,BEYOND THE END,"He began to tell her about the local office for outgoing mails, where a"
1906,BEYOND THE END,"nephew of her husband, Paytor, had taken a job."
1907,BEYOND THE END,
1908,BEYOND THE END,The child sat so still that it was painful and Julie Anspacher moved
1909,BEYOND THE END,"away, thinking aloud:"
1910,BEYOND THE END,
1911,BEYOND THE END,“All is corruption.”
1912,BEYOND THE END,
1913,BEYOND THE END,"The child started, and looked quickly away, as children will at"
1914,BEYOND THE END,something that they expect but do not understand. The driver beat the
1915,BEYOND THE END,"horses, until long lines of heavy froth appeared at the edges of the"
1916,BEYOND THE END,harness.
1917,BEYOND THE END,
1918,BEYOND THE END,"“What did you say, ma’am?”"
1919,BEYOND THE END,
1920,BEYOND THE END,“Nothing—I said all is lost from the beginning—if we only saw
1921,BEYOND THE END,it—always.”
1922,BEYOND THE END,
1923,BEYOND THE END,"The child looked at her slowly, puzzled, and looked down."
1924,BEYOND THE END,
1925,BEYOND THE END,"“Ann,” said Julie Anspacher, suddenly lifting the muff over her hands,"
1926,BEYOND THE END,“did you ever see two such big horses before?” The child turned its head
1927,BEYOND THE END,"with brightness, and bending down tried to see between the driver’s"
1928,BEYOND THE END,arms. Then she smiled.
1929,BEYOND THE END,
1930,BEYOND THE END,“Are they yours?” she whispered.
1931,BEYOND THE END,
1932,BEYOND THE END,"Julie Anspacher took in a deep breath, stretching the silk of her waist"
1933,BEYOND THE END,"across her breasts. “No,” she answered, “they are not mine, but we have"
1934,BEYOND THE END,two—bigger—blacker.”
1935,BEYOND THE END,
1936,BEYOND THE END,“Can I see them?”
1937,BEYOND THE END,
1938,BEYOND THE END,"“Oh, yes, you shall see them. Don’t be ridiculous.”"
1939,BEYOND THE END,
1940,BEYOND THE END,"The child shrank back into herself, clutching nervously at her muff."
1941,BEYOND THE END,Julie Anspacher returned to her reflections.
1942,BEYOND THE END,
1943,BEYOND THE END,
1944,BEYOND THE END,It was almost five years since she had been home. Five years before in
1945,BEYOND THE END,just such an Autumn the doctors had given her six months to live. One
1946,BEYOND THE END,"lung gone and the other going. They called it sometimes the White Death,"
1947,BEYOND THE END,"and, sometimes, the love disease. She coughed a little, remembering, and"
1948,BEYOND THE END,"the child at her side coughed too in echo, and the driver, puckering his"
1949,BEYOND THE END,"forehead, reflected that Mrs. Anspacher was not cured."
1950,BEYOND THE END,
1951,BEYOND THE END,She was thirty-nine—she should have died at thirty-four. In those five
1952,BEYOND THE END,"years Paytor had seen her five times, coming in over fourteen hours of"
1953,BEYOND THE END,"the rails at Christmas. He cursed the doctors, called them fools."
1954,BEYOND THE END,
1955,BEYOND THE END,"The house appeared dull white between the locust trees, and the smoke,"
1956,BEYOND THE END,"the same lazy Autumn smoke, rose in a still column straight into the"
1957,BEYOND THE END,obliterating day.
1958,BEYOND THE END,
1959,BEYOND THE END,The driver reined in the horses until their foaming jaws struck against
1960,BEYOND THE END,"their harness, and with a quick bound Julie Anspacher jumped the side of"
1961,BEYOND THE END,"the cart, the short modish tails of her jacket dancing above her hips."
1962,BEYOND THE END,"She turned around and thrusting her black gloved hands under the child,"
1963,BEYOND THE END,lifted her out. A dog barked. She began walking the ascent toward the
1964,BEYOND THE END,house.
1965,BEYOND THE END,
1966,BEYOND THE END,"A maid, in dust cap, put her head out of an upstairs window, clucked,"
1967,BEYOND THE END,"drew it in and slammed the sash, and Paytor, with slow and deliberate"
1968,BEYOND THE END,"steps, moved toward the figure of his wife and the child."
1969,BEYOND THE END,
1970,BEYOND THE END,"He was a man of middle height, with a close-cropped beard that ended in"
1971,BEYOND THE END,"a grey wedge on his chin. He was sturdy, a strong man, almost too"
1972,BEYOND THE END,"pompous, but with kindly blue eyes and a long thin mouth. As he walked"
1973,BEYOND THE END,"he threw his knees out, which gave him a rocking though substantial"
1974,BEYOND THE END,gait. He was slightly surprised and raised the apricot-coloured veil
1975,BEYOND THE END,"that covered the keen newness of her face, and leaning down kissed her"
1976,BEYOND THE END,twice upon both cheeks.
1977,BEYOND THE END,
1978,BEYOND THE END,"“And where does the child come from?” he inquired, touching the little"
1979,BEYOND THE END,girl’s chin.
1980,BEYOND THE END,
1981,BEYOND THE END,"“Come along, don’t be ridiculous!” Julie said impatiently, and swept on"
1982,BEYOND THE END,toward the house.
1983,BEYOND THE END,
1984,BEYOND THE END,"He ran after her. “I’m glad to see you,” he went on, warmly, trying to"
1985,BEYOND THE END,"keep up with her rapid strides, that swung the child half off the"
1986,BEYOND THE END,"ground, stumbling, trotting."
1987,BEYOND THE END,
1988,BEYOND THE END,“Tell me what the doctors said—cured?”
1989,BEYOND THE END,
1990,BEYOND THE END,There was a note of happiness in his voice. “Not that I really give a
1991,BEYOND THE END,"damn what they think, I always told you you would live to a ripe old"
1992,BEYOND THE END,"age, as they say. What did they do to Marie Bashkirtseff? Locked her up"
1993,BEYOND THE END,"in a dark room, shut all the windows—and of course she died—that was"
1994,BEYOND THE END,their method then—and now it’s Koch’s tuberculin—all nonsense.”
1995,BEYOND THE END,
1996,BEYOND THE END,"“It worked well with some people,” she said, going ahead of him into the"
1997,BEYOND THE END,living room. “There was one boy there—well—of that later. Will you have
1998,BEYOND THE END,someone put Ann to bed—the trip was bad for her. See how sleepy the
1999,BEYOND THE END,"child is—run along, Ann,” she added, pushing her slightly but kindly"
2000,BEYOND THE END,"toward the maid. Then when they had disappeared, she stood looking about"
2001,BEYOND THE END,"her, drawing off her gloves."
2002,BEYOND THE END,
2003,BEYOND THE END,“I’m glad you took down the crystals—I always hated them.”—She moved to
2004,BEYOND THE END,the windows.
2005,BEYOND THE END,
2006,BEYOND THE END,"“I didn’t, the roof fell in—just after my last visit in December. You’re"
2007,BEYOND THE END,"looking splendid, Julie.” He coloured. “I’m glad, you know—awfully glad."
2008,BEYOND THE END,"I began to think—well, not that the doctors know anything,” he said,"
2009,BEYOND THE END,"laughing: “but it’s a drop here of about fifteen hundred feet, but your"
2010,BEYOND THE END,heart is good—always was.”
2011,BEYOND THE END,
2012,BEYOND THE END,"“What do you know about my heart, Paytor?” Julie said, angrily. “You"
2013,BEYOND THE END,don’t know what you are talking about at all. The child——”
2014,BEYOND THE END,
2015,BEYOND THE END,"“Well, yes——?”"
2016,BEYOND THE END,
2017,BEYOND THE END,"“Her name is Ann,” she finished sulkily."
2018,BEYOND THE END,
2019,BEYOND THE END,"“It’s a sweet name—it was your mother’s, too. Whose is she?”"
2020,BEYOND THE END,
2021,BEYOND THE END,"“Oh, good heavens!” Julie cried, moving around the room. “Mine, mine,"
2022,BEYOND THE END,"mine, of course, whose would she be if not mine?”"
2023,BEYOND THE END,
2024,BEYOND THE END,"He looked at her. “Yours—why, Julie—how absurd!” Slowly the colour left"
2025,BEYOND THE END,his face.
2026,BEYOND THE END,
2027,BEYOND THE END,"“I know—we have got to talk it over—it’s all got to be arranged, it’s"
2028,BEYOND THE END,"terrible. But she is nice, a bright child, a good child.”"
2029,BEYOND THE END,
2030,BEYOND THE END,"“What in the world is all this about?” he demanded, stopping in front of"
2031,BEYOND THE END,her. “What are you in this mood for—what have I done?”
2032,BEYOND THE END,
2033,BEYOND THE END,“Good heavens! What have you done? What a ridiculous man you are. Why
2034,BEYOND THE END,"nothing, of course, absolutely nothing!” She waved her arm. “That’s not"
2035,BEYOND THE END,"it—why do you bring yourself in? I’m not blaming you, I’m not asking to"
2036,BEYOND THE END,"be forgiven. I’ve been down on my knees, I’ve beaten my head on the"
2037,BEYOND THE END,"ground, abased myself, but,” she said in a terrible voice, “it is not"
2038,BEYOND THE END,"low enough, the ground is not low enough, to bend is not enough; to ask"
2039,BEYOND THE END,"forgiveness is not enough, to receive it is nothing. There isn’t the"
2040,BEYOND THE END,"right kind of misery in the world for me to suffer, nor the right kind"
2041,BEYOND THE END,"of pity for you to feel, there isn’t the right word in the world to heal"
2042,BEYOND THE END,"me up. It’s good to forgive, to be forgiven, but that’s for ordinary"
2043,BEYOND THE END,things. This is beyond that—it’s something you can experience but never
2044,BEYOND THE END,"feel—there are not enough nerves, blood cells, flesh—to feel it. You"
2045,BEYOND THE END,"suffer insufficiently; it’s like drinking insufficiently, sleeping"
2046,BEYOND THE END,insufficiently. I’m not asking anything because there is nothing that I
2047,BEYOND THE END,can receive—how primitive to be able to receive——”
2048,BEYOND THE END,
2049,BEYOND THE END,"“But, Julie——”"
2050,BEYOND THE END,
2051,BEYOND THE END,"“It’s not that,” she said roughly, tears swimming in her eyes. “Of"
2052,BEYOND THE END,"course I love you. But think of it, a danger to everyone excepting those"
2053,BEYOND THE END,"like yourself. Curious, involved in a problem affecting only a small per"
2054,BEYOND THE END,"cent of humanity, sick, frightened, filled with fever and lust"
2055,BEYOND THE END,"perhaps—with nothing, nothing coming after, whatever you do, but"
2056,BEYOND THE END,"death—then you go on—it goes on—then the child—and life probably, for a"
2057,BEYOND THE END,time.”
2058,BEYOND THE END,
2059,BEYOND THE END,“Well——”
2060,BEYOND THE END,
2061,BEYOND THE END,"“I couldn’t tell you. I thought, ‘Well, I’ll die next month,’ and"
2062,BEYOND THE END,"finally I didn’t want to go off—although I did, you know what I mean."
2063,BEYOND THE END,"Then her father died—they say her lungs are weak—death, death"
2064,BEYOND THE END,"perpetuating itself, that’s funny you see—and the doctors——” She swung"
2065,BEYOND THE END,"around: “You’re right—they lied, and I lived through—all the way—all the"
2066,BEYOND THE END,way!”
2067,BEYOND THE END,
2068,BEYOND THE END,He turned his face from her.
2069,BEYOND THE END,
2070,BEYOND THE END,"“The real thing,” she went on in a pained voice, “is to turn our torment"
2071,BEYOND THE END,toward the perfect design. I didn’t want to go beyond you—that was not
2072,BEYOND THE END,my purpose. I thought there was not to be any more me. I wanted to leave
2073,BEYOND THE END,"nothing behind but you, only you. You must believe this or I can’t bear"
2074,BEYOND THE END,"it—and still,” she continued, walking around the room impatiently,"
2075,BEYOND THE END,"“there was a somehow hysterical joy in it too. I thought, if you had"
2076,BEYOND THE END,"real perception, that ‘something’ that we must possess, that must be at"
2077,BEYOND THE END,the bottom of us somewhere—or there wouldn’t be such an almost sensuous
2078,BEYOND THE END,"desire for it, that ‘something’ that, at times, is so near us that it"
2079,BEYOND THE END,"becomes obscene, well, I thought, if Paytor has this—and mind you, I"
2080,BEYOND THE END,knew all the time that you didn’t have it—that you would understand. And
2081,BEYOND THE END,"when you had been gone a long time I said, ‘Paytor understands’—and I"
2082,BEYOND THE END,"would say to myself—‘Now, at this moment—at ten-thirty precisely, if I"
2083,BEYOND THE END,"could be with Paytor he would say “I see,”’ but so soon as I had the"
2084,BEYOND THE END,time table in my hand I knew that there was no such feeling in your
2085,BEYOND THE END,bosom—nothing at all.”
2086,BEYOND THE END,
2087,BEYOND THE END,"“Don’t you feel horror?” he asked in a loud voice, suddenly."
2088,BEYOND THE END,
2089,BEYOND THE END,"“No, I don’t feel horror—horror is conflict—and I have none—I’m alien to"
2090,BEYOND THE END,life.”
2091,BEYOND THE END,
2092,BEYOND THE END,"“Have you a religion, Julie?” he asked, still in the same loud voice, as"
2093,BEYOND THE END,"if he were addressing someone a little raised, yet invisible, as one"
2094,BEYOND THE END,tries to see a choir.
2095,BEYOND THE END,
2096,BEYOND THE END,“I don’t know—I don’t think so. I’ve tried to believe in something
2097,BEYOND THE END,"external, something that might envelop this and carry it beyond—that’s"
2098,BEYOND THE END,"what we demand of our faiths, isn’t it? But I always return to a fixed"
2099,BEYOND THE END,notion that there is something more fitting than a possible release.”
2100,BEYOND THE END,
2101,BEYOND THE END,"He put his hands to his head. “You know,” he said, “I’ve always thought"
2102,BEYOND THE END,"that a woman, because she can have children, ought to know the truth—the"
2103,BEYOND THE END,very fact that she can do something so really preposterous ought to make
2104,BEYOND THE END,her equally capable of the other preposterous thing—well——”
2105,BEYOND THE END,
2106,BEYOND THE END,"She coughed, her handkerchief before her face—she laughed with"
2107,BEYOND THE END,"brightness. “One learns to be careful about death—but never, never"
2108,BEYOND THE END,about——” She didn’t finish but stared before her.
2109,BEYOND THE END,
2110,BEYOND THE END,“Why did you bring the child here—why did you return at all then—after
2111,BEYOND THE END,so long a time—it seems all so mixed up?”
2112,BEYOND THE END,
2113,BEYOND THE END,"“I don’t know—— Perhaps because there is a right and a wrong, and a good"
2114,BEYOND THE END,and an evil. I had to find out—and if there’s such a thing as
2115,BEYOND THE END,everlasting mercy—I want to find out about that also—there’s a flavour
2116,BEYOND THE END,"of unfamiliar intimacy about it all, though, this Christian treatment——”"
2117,BEYOND THE END,"She had a way of lifting up the side of her face, closing her eyes. “I"
2118,BEYOND THE END,thought—Paytor may know.”
2119,BEYOND THE END,
2120,BEYOND THE END,“Know what?”
2121,BEYOND THE END,
2122,BEYOND THE END,"“Will know—well, will be able to divide me against myself—— Personally I"
2123,BEYOND THE END,don’t feel divided—I seem to be a sane and balanced whole—a hopelessly
2124,BEYOND THE END,"mixed, but perfect design. So I said Paytor will be able to see where"
2125,BEYOND THE END,this divides and departs. Though all the time I never for a moment felt
2126,BEYOND THE END,"that there was a system working on a this for that basis, but that there"
2127,BEYOND THE END,was only this _and_ that—in other words—I wanted to be set wrong.... You
2128,BEYOND THE END,understand?”
2129,BEYOND THE END,
2130,BEYOND THE END,"“And you yourself,” he inquired, in the same loud voice, “cannot feel"
2131,BEYOND THE END,"the war? Well, then, what about me?—you must realize what you have"
2132,BEYOND THE END,"done—turned everything upside down—oh, I won’t even say betrayed me—it’s"
2133,BEYOND THE END,"much less than that, what most of us do, we betray circumstances—well, I"
2134,BEYOND THE END,"can’t do anything for you,” he said sharply. “I can’t do anything at"
2135,BEYOND THE END,"all—I’m sorry, I’m very sorry—but there it is”—he began to grimace and"
2136,BEYOND THE END,twitch his shoulders.
2137,BEYOND THE END,
2138,BEYOND THE END,"“The child has it too,” Julie Anspacher said, looking up at him. “I"
2139,BEYOND THE END,"shall die soon.—It’s ridiculous,” she added, with the tears streaming"
2140,BEYOND THE END,"down her face. “You are strong, always were—and so were all your family"
2141,BEYOND THE END,before you—not one of them in their graves under ninety—it’s all
2142,BEYOND THE END,wrong—it’s quite ridiculous.”
2143,BEYOND THE END,
2144,BEYOND THE END,“I don’t know. Perhaps it’s not ridiculous. One must be very careful not
2145,BEYOND THE END,"to come, too hastily, to a conclusion.” He began searching for his pipe."
2146,BEYOND THE END,"“Only you know yourself, Julie, how I torment myself, if it’s a big"
2147,BEYOND THE END,"enough thing, for days, weeks, years; and the reason is, the real reason"
2148,BEYOND THE END,"is, that I come to my conclusions instantly, and then fight to destroy"
2149,BEYOND THE END,them.” He seemed to Julie a little pompous now. “It’s because first I’m
2150,BEYOND THE END,"human, and second, logical. Well, I don’t know—perhaps I’ll be able to"
2151,BEYOND THE END,tell you something later—give you a beginning at least—later——” He
2152,BEYOND THE END,"twitched his shoulders and went out, closing the door after him. She"
2153,BEYOND THE END,"heard him climbing the familiar creaking stairs, the yellow painted"
2154,BEYOND THE END,stairs that led up into the roof—she heard him strike a match—then
2155,BEYOND THE END,silence.
2156,BEYOND THE END,
2157,BEYOND THE END,
2158,BEYOND THE END,"The dark had begun, closing in about bushes and barn, and filling the"
2159,BEYOND THE END,"air with moist joyousness, the joyousness of autumn that trusts itself"
2160,BEYOND THE END,"to the darkness, and Julie leaned on her hand by the shelf and listened."
2161,BEYOND THE END,
2162,BEYOND THE END,"She could hear, far away and faint, the sound of dogs on heavy chains."
2163,BEYOND THE END,"She tried to stop, listening to the outside, but her thoughts rotted"
2164,BEYOND THE END,away like clouds in a wind.
2165,BEYOND THE END,
2166,BEYOND THE END,"The sense of tears came to her, but it was only a sentimental memory of"
2167,BEYOND THE END,"her early childhood, and it brought a smile to her long face. She had"
2168,BEYOND THE END,cried once when they made her kiss a dead priest—“Qui habitare facit
2169,BEYOND THE END,sterilem—matrem filiorum laetantem”—then “Gloria Patri—” and she had
2170,BEYOND THE END,"wept then, or thought she had, because he was not only beyond glory and"
2171,BEYOND THE END,"all mercy, but beyond the dubious comfort of the feeling."
2172,BEYOND THE END,
2173,BEYOND THE END,"She heard Paytor walking above, and the smoke of his pipe crept down"
2174,BEYOND THE END,between loose boards and uneven plaster and laths.
2175,BEYOND THE END,
2176,BEYOND THE END,"She went—quite mechanically—over to a chest in one corner, and opened"
2177,BEYOND THE END,"the lid. A shirt waist, of striped taffeta, one she had worn years"
2178,BEYOND THE END,"before, some old Spanish lace—her mother’s—the child——"
2179,BEYOND THE END,
2180,BEYOND THE END,Paytor did not seem to like the child—“How ridiculous!” she thought.
2181,BEYOND THE END,"“She is good, quiet, gentle—but that’s not enough now.” She removed her"
2182,BEYOND THE END,"hat. Living with Paytor and the child—Paytor so strong,—always was, and"
2183,BEYOND THE END,"so was his family—and she sickly, coughing. Perhaps she had made a"
2184,BEYOND THE END,mistake in coming back. She went toward the steps to tell this to Paytor
2185,BEYOND THE END,but thought better of it. That wasn’t what she wanted to say.
2186,BEYOND THE END,
2187,BEYOND THE END,"The hours drew out and Julie Anspacher, sitting now at the window"
2188,BEYOND THE END,overlooking the garden—nodded without sleep—long dreams—grotesque and
2189,BEYOND THE END,abominable—stupid irrelevances dull and interminable. Somewhere little
2190,BEYOND THE END,"Ann coughed in her sleep. Julie Anspacher coughed also, and in between,"
2191,BEYOND THE END,"the sound of Paytor walking up and down, and the smell of tobacco"
2192,BEYOND THE END,growing stronger.
2193,BEYOND THE END,
2194,BEYOND THE END,"To take her own life, that was right, if only she had not the habit of"
2195,BEYOND THE END,"fighting death—“but death is past knowing, and to know is better than to"
2196,BEYOND THE END,make right——” She shook her head. “That’s another detour on the wrong
2197,BEYOND THE END,"side,” she told herself. “If only I had the power to feel pain as"
2198,BEYOND THE END,"unbearable, a gust of passion, of impatience, and all would be over—but"
2199,BEYOND THE END,"I’ve stood so much so long, there is no too long.” She thought what she"
2200,BEYOND THE END,"would not give for any kind of feeling, anything that was vital and"
2201,BEYOND THE END,sudden and determining. “If Paytor will have patience I will get around
2202,BEYOND THE END,to it.”
2203,BEYOND THE END,
2204,BEYOND THE END,"Then it seemed that something must happen, must inevitably happen."
2205,BEYOND THE END,
2206,BEYOND THE END,"“If I could only think of the right word before it happens,” she said to"
2207,BEYOND THE END,"herself, over and over, and over. “It’s because I’m cold and I can’t"
2208,BEYOND THE END,"think, I’ll think soon——” She would take her jacket off, put on her"
2209,BEYOND THE END,coat——
2210,BEYOND THE END,
2211,BEYOND THE END,"She got up, running her hand along the wall. Or had she left it on the"
2212,BEYOND THE END,"chair? “I can’t think of the word,” she said to keep her mind on"
2213,BEYOND THE END,something.
2214,BEYOND THE END,
2215,BEYOND THE END,"She turned around. All his family—long lives. “And me too, me too,” she"
2216,BEYOND THE END,murmured. She became dizzy. “It is because I must get on my knees—but it
2217,BEYOND THE END,isn’t low enough.” She contradicted herself. “Yet if I put my head
2218,BEYOND THE END,down—way down—down——”
2219,BEYOND THE END,
2220,BEYOND THE END,Then she heard the shot. “He has quick warm blood” went through her
2221,BEYOND THE END,mind—and her blood was cold.
2222,BEYOND THE END,
2223,BEYOND THE END,"Her forehead had not quite touched the boards, now she touched them, but"
2224,BEYOND THE END,"she got up immediately, stumbling over her dress."

2281,OSCAR,
2282,OSCAR,
2283,OSCAR,"Before the house rose two stately pine trees, and all about small firs"
2284,OSCAR,and hemlocks. The garden path struggled up to the porch between wild
2285,OSCAR,"flowers and weeds, and looming against its ancient bulk the shadows of"
2286,OSCAR,out-houses and barns.
2287,OSCAR,
2288,OSCAR,"It stood among the hills, and just below around a curve in the road, lay"
2289,OSCAR,the placid grey reservoir.
2290,OSCAR,
2291,OSCAR,"Sometimes parties would cross the fields, walking slowly toward the"
2292,OSCAR,mountains. And sometimes children could be heard murmuring in the
2293,OSCAR,underbrush of things they scarcely knew.
2294,OSCAR,
2295,OSCAR,"Strange things had happened in this country town. Murder, theft, and"
2296,OSCAR,"little girls found weeping, and silent morose boys scowling along in the"
2297,OSCAR,"ragweed, with half-shut sunburned eyelids."
2298,OSCAR,
2299,OSCAR,"The place was wild, deserted and impossible in Winter. In Summer it was"
2300,OSCAR,over-run with artists and town folk with wives and babies. Every
2301,OSCAR,"Saturday there were fairs on the green, where second-hand articles were"
2302,OSCAR,"sold for a song, and flirting was formidable and passing. There were"
2303,OSCAR,"picnics, mountain climbings, speeches in the townhall, on the mark of"
2304,OSCAR,"the beast, on sin, and democracy, and once in a while a lecture on"
2305,OSCAR,"something that “everyone should know,” attended by mothers, their"
2306,OSCAR,offspring left with servants who knew what everyone shouldn’t.
2307,OSCAR,
2308,OSCAR,"Then there were movies, bare legs, deacons, misses in cascades of curls"
2309,OSCAR,"and on Sunday one could listen to Mr. Widdie, the clergyman, who"
2310,OSCAR,"suffered from consumption, speak on love of one’s neighbour."
2311,OSCAR,
2312,OSCAR,"In this house and in this town had lived, for some fifteen years or so,"
2313,OSCAR,Emma Gonsberg.
2314,OSCAR,
2315,OSCAR,"She was a little creature, lively, smiling, extremely good-natured. She"
2316,OSCAR,"had been married twice, divorced once, and was now a widow still in her"
2317,OSCAR,thirties.
2318,OSCAR,
2319,OSCAR,Of her two husbands she seldom said anything. Once she made the remark:
2320,OSCAR,"“Only fancy, they never did catch on to me at all.”"
2321,OSCAR,
2322,OSCAR,"She tried to be fashionable, did her hair in the Venetian style, wore"
2323,OSCAR,gowns after the manner of Lady de Bath entering her carriage; and tried
2324,OSCAR,to cultivate only those who could tell her “where she stood.”
2325,OSCAR,
2326,OSCAR,Her son Oscar was fourteen or thereabouts. He wore distinctly
2327,OSCAR,"over-decorative English clothes, and remembered two words of some"
2328,OSCAR,"obscure Indian dialect that seemed to mean “fleas,” for whenever he"
2329,OSCAR,flung these words defiantly at visitors they would go off into peals of
2330,OSCAR,"laughter, headed by his mother. At such times he would lower his eyes"
2331,OSCAR,and show a row of too heavy teeth.
2332,OSCAR,
2333,OSCAR,"Emma Gonsberg loved flowers, but could not grow them. She admired cats"
2334,OSCAR,"because there was “nothing servile about them,” but they would not stay"
2335,OSCAR,with her; and though she loved horses and longed to be one of those
2336,OSCAR,daring women who could handle them “without being crushed in the
2337,OSCAR,"stalls,” they nevertheless ignored her with calm indifference. Of her"
2338,OSCAR,"loves, passions and efforts, she had managed to raise a few ill-smelling"
2339,OSCAR,"pheasants, and had to let it go at that."
2340,OSCAR,
2341,OSCAR,In the Winter she led a lonely and discriminating life. In the Summer
2342,OSCAR,"her house filled with mixed characters, as one might say. A hot"
2343,OSCAR,"melancholy Jew, an officer who was always upon the point of depreciating"
2344,OSCAR,"his medals in a conceited voice, and one other who swore inoffensively."
2345,OSCAR,
2346,OSCAR,"Finally she had given this sort of thing up, partly because she had"
2347,OSCAR,"managed, soon after, to get herself entangled with a man called Ulric"
2348,OSCAR,"Straussmann. A tall rough fellow, who said he came from the Tyrol; a"
2349,OSCAR,fellow without sensibilities but with a certain bitter sensuality. A
2350,OSCAR,"good-natured creature as far as he went, with vivid streaks of German"
2351,OSCAR,"lust, which had at once something sentimental and something careless"
2352,OSCAR,"about it; the type who can turn the country, with a single gesture, into"
2353,OSCAR,"a brothel, and makes of children strong enemies. He showed no little"
2354,OSCAR,audacity in putting things into people’s minds that he would not do
2355,OSCAR,himself.
2356,OSCAR,
2357,OSCAR,"He smelled very strongly of horses, and was proud of it. He pretended a"
2358,OSCAR,"fondness for all that goes under hide or hair, but a collie bitch, known"
2359,OSCAR,"for her gentleness, snapped at him and bit him. He invariably carried a"
2360,OSCAR,"leather thong, braided at the base for a handle, and would stand for"
2361,OSCAR,"hours talking, with his legs apart, whirling this contrived whip, and,"
2362,OSCAR,"looking out of the corner of his eyes would pull his moustache, waiting"
2363,OSCAR,to see which of the ladies would draw her feet in.
2364,OSCAR,
2365,OSCAR,"He talked in a rather even, slightly nasal tone, wetting his lips with a"
2366,OSCAR,"long outthrust of tongue, like an animal. His teeth were splendid and"
2367,OSCAR,"his tongue unusually red, and he prided himself on these and on the"
2368,OSCAR,"calves of his legs. They were large, muscular and rather handsome."
2369,OSCAR,
2370,OSCAR,He liked to boast that there was nothing that he could not do and be
2371,OSCAR,"forgiven, because, as he expressed it, “I have always left people"
2372,OSCAR,"satisfied.” If it were hate or if it were love, he seemed to have come"
2373,OSCAR,"off with unusual success. “Most people are puny,” he would add, “while I"
2374,OSCAR,"am large, strong, healthy. Solid flesh through and through,” whereat he"
2375,OSCAR,would pound his chest and smile.
2376,OSCAR,
2377,OSCAR,He was new to the town and sufficiently insolent to attract attention.
2378,OSCAR,"There was also something childishly naïve in him, as there is in all"
2379,OSCAR,"tall and robust men who talk about themselves. This probably saved him,"
2380,OSCAR,"because when he was drinking he often became gross and insulting, but he"
2381,OSCAR,soon put the women of the party in a good humour by giving one of them a
2382,OSCAR,hearty and good-natured slap on the rear that she was not likely to
2383,OSCAR,forget.
2384,OSCAR,
2385,OSCAR,"Besides this man Emma had a few old friends of the less interesting,"
2386,OSCAR,"though better-read, type. Among them, however, was an exception, Oliver"
2387,OSCAR,"Kahn, a married man with several children one heard of and never saw. A"
2388,OSCAR,"strange, quiet man who was always talking. He had splendid eyes and a"
2389,OSCAR,poor mouth—very full lips. In the beginning one surmised that he had
2390,OSCAR,been quite an adventurer. He had an odour about him of the rather recent
2391,OSCAR,cult of the “terribly good.” He seemed to have been unkind to his family
2392,OSCAR,"in some way, and was spending the rest of his life in a passion of"
2393,OSCAR,regret and remorse. He had become one of those guests who are only
2394,OSCAR,"missed when absent. He finally stayed for good, sleeping in an ante-room"
2395,OSCAR,"with his boots on,—his one royal habit."
2396,OSCAR,
2397,OSCAR,In the beginning Emma had liked him tremendously. He was at once gentle
2398,OSCAR,"and furious, but of late, just prior to the Straussmann affair, he had"
2399,OSCAR,"begun to irritate her. She thought to herself, “He is going mad, that’s"
2400,OSCAR,"all.” She was angry at herself for saying “that’s all,” as if she had"
2401,OSCAR,"expected something different, more momentous."
2402,OSCAR,
2403,OSCAR,"He had enormous appetites, he ate like a Porthos and drank like a"
2404,OSCAR,"Pantagruel, and talked hour after hour about the same thing, “Love of"
2405,OSCAR,"one’s neighbour,” and spent his spare time in standing with his hands"
2406,OSCAR,"behind him, in front of the pheasants’ cage. He had been a snipe hunter"
2407,OSCAR,"in his time, and once went on a big game hunt, but now he said he saw"
2408,OSCAR,something more significant here.
2409,OSCAR,
2410,OSCAR,"He had, like all good sportsmen, even shot himself through the hand, but"
2411,OSCAR,of late he pretended that he did not remember what the scar came from.
2412,OSCAR,
2413,OSCAR,He seemed to suffer a good deal. Evil went deep and good went deep and
2414,OSCAR,he suffered the tortures of the damned. He wept and laughed and ate and
2415,OSCAR,"drank and slept, and year by year his eyes grew sweeter, tenderer, and"
2416,OSCAR,"his mouth fuller, more gross."
2417,OSCAR,
2418,OSCAR,"The child Oscar did not like Kahn, yet sometimes he would become"
2419,OSCAR,"extraordinarily excited, talk very fast, almost banteringly, a little"
2420,OSCAR,"malignly, and once when Kahn had taken his hand he drew it away angrily."
2421,OSCAR,"“Don’t,” he said."
2422,OSCAR,
2423,OSCAR,“Why not?”
2424,OSCAR,
2425,OSCAR,"“Because it is dirty,” he retorted maliciously."
2426,OSCAR,
2427,OSCAR,"“As if you really knew of what I was thinking,” Kahn said, and put his"
2428,OSCAR,own hands behind him.
2429,OSCAR,
2430,OSCAR,"Emma liked Kahn, was attached to him. He mentioned her faults without"
2431,OSCAR,"regret or reproval, and this in itself was a divine sort of love."
2432,OSCAR,
2433,OSCAR,He would remark: “We cannot be just because we are bewildered; we ought
2434,OSCAR,"to be proud enough to welcome our enemies as judges, but we hate, and to"
2435,OSCAR,hate is the act of the incurious. I love with an everlasting but a
2436,OSCAR,"changing love, because I know I am the wrong sort of man to be good—and"
2437,OSCAR,because I revere the shadow on the threshold.”
2438,OSCAR,
2439,OSCAR,"“What shadow, Kahn?”"
2440,OSCAR,
2441,OSCAR,"“In one man we called it Christ—it is energy; for most of us it is dead,"
2442,OSCAR,"a phantom. If you have it you _are_ Christ, and if you have only a"
2443,OSCAR,little of it you are but the promise of the Messiah.”
2444,OSCAR,
2445,OSCAR,"These seemed great words, and she looked at him with a little admiring"
2446,OSCAR,smile.
2447,OSCAR,
2448,OSCAR,“You make me uneasy for fear that I have not said ‘I love you with an
2449,OSCAR,"everlasting love,’ often enough to make it an act of fanaticism.”"
2450,OSCAR,
2451,OSCAR,"As for Oscar, he did what he liked, which gave him character, but made"
2452,OSCAR,him difficult to live with.
2453,OSCAR,
2454,OSCAR,"He was not one of those “weedy” youths, long of leg, and stringy like"
2455,OSCAR,"“jerked beef, thank God!” as his mother said to visitors. He was rather"
2456,OSCAR,"too full-grown, thick of calf and hip and rather heavy of feature. His"
2457,OSCAR,hands and feet were not out of proportion as is usually the case with
2458,OSCAR,"children of his age, but they were too old looking."
2459,OSCAR,
2460,OSCAR,He did not smoke surreptitiously. On the contrary he had taken out a
2461,OSCAR,"pipe one day in front of his mother, and filling it, smoked in silence,"
2462,OSCAR,"not even with a frightened air, and for that matter not even with a"
2463,OSCAR,"particularly bold air;—he did it quite simply, as something he had"
2464,OSCAR,"finally decided to do, and Emma Gonsberg had gone off to Kahn with it,"
2465,OSCAR,in a rather helpless manner.
2466,OSCAR,
2467,OSCAR,"Most children swing in circles about a room, clumsily. Oscar on the"
2468,OSCAR,"contrary walked into the four corners placidly and officially, looked at"
2469,OSCAR,"the backs of the books here and a picture there, and even grunted"
2470,OSCAR,approvingly at one or two in quite a mature manner.
2471,OSCAR,
2472,OSCAR,"He had a sweetheart, and about her and his treatment of her there were"
2473,OSCAR,"only a few of the usual signs—he was shy, and passionately immersed in"
2474,OSCAR,"her, there was little of the casual smartness of first calf love about"
2475,OSCAR,"it, though he did in truth wave her off with a grin if he was"
2476,OSCAR,questioned.
2477,OSCAR,
2478,OSCAR,He took himself with seriousness amounting to a lack of humour—and
2479,OSCAR,"though he himself knew that he was a youth, and had the earmarks of"
2480,OSCAR,"adolescence about him—and know it he certainly did—once he said, “Well,"
2481,OSCAR,what of it—is that any reason why I should not be serious about
2482,OSCAR,everything?” This remark had so astonished his mother that she had
2483,OSCAR,immediately sent for Kahn to know if he thought the child was
2484,OSCAR,"precocious—and Kahn had answered, “If he were, I should be better"
2485,OSCAR,pleased.”
2486,OSCAR,
2487,OSCAR,“But what is one to expect?”
2488,OSCAR,
2489,OSCAR,"“Children,” he answered, “are never what they are supposed to be, and"
2490,OSCAR,"they never have been. He may be old for his age, but what child hasn’t"
2491,OSCAR,been?”
2492,OSCAR,
2493,OSCAR,"In the meantime, she tried to bring Straussmann and Kahn together—“My"
2494,OSCAR,"house is all at odds,” she thought, but these two never hit it off."
2495,OSCAR,"Straussmann always appeared dreadfully superficial and cynical, and Kahn"
2496,OSCAR,dull and good about nothing.
2497,OSCAR,
2498,OSCAR,"“They have both got abnormal appetites,” she thought wearily. She"
2499,OSCAR,listened to them trying to talk together of an evening on the piazza
2500,OSCAR,steps. Kahn was saying:
2501,OSCAR,
2502,OSCAR,"“You must, however, warn yourself, in fact I might say arm yourself,"
2503,OSCAR,"against any sensation of pleasure in doing good; this is very difficult,"
2504,OSCAR,"I know, but it can be attained. You can give and forgive and tolerate"
2505,OSCAR,"gently and, as one might say, casually, until it’s a second nature.”"
2506,OSCAR,
2507,OSCAR,"“There you have it, tolerate—who wants tolerance, or a second nature?"
2508,OSCAR,"Well, let us drop it. I feel like a child—it’s difficult not to feel"
2509,OSCAR,like a child.”
2510,OSCAR,
2511,OSCAR,"“Like Oscar—he has transports—even at his age,” Emma added hesitatingly."
2512,OSCAR,“Perhaps that’s not quite as it should be?”
2513,OSCAR,
2514,OSCAR,"“The memory of growing up is worse than the fear of death,” Kahn"
2515,OSCAR,"remarked, and Emma sighed."
2516,OSCAR,
2517,OSCAR,"“I don’t know; the country was made for children, they say—I could tell"
2518,OSCAR,"you a story about that,” Straussmann broke off, whistling to Oscar."
2519,OSCAR,“Shall I tell Oscar about the country—and what it is really like?” he
2520,OSCAR,"asked Emma, turning his head."
2521,OSCAR,
2522,OSCAR,“Let the boy alone.”
2523,OSCAR,
2524,OSCAR,"“Why, over there in that small village,” Straussmann went on, taking"
2525,OSCAR,Oscar by the arm. “It is a pretty tale I could tell you—perhaps I will
2526,OSCAR,when you are older—but don’t let your mother persuade you that the
2527,OSCAR,"country is a nice, healthful, clean place, because, my child, it’s"
2528,OSCAR,corrupt.”
2529,OSCAR,
2530,OSCAR,"“Will you let the boy alone!” Emma cried, turning very red."
2531,OSCAR,
2532,OSCAR,"“Ah, eh—I’ll let him alone right enough—but it won’t make much"
2533,OSCAR,"difference—you’ll see,” he went on. “There is a great deal told to"
2534,OSCAR,"children that they should not hear, I’ll admit, but there wasn’t a thing"
2535,OSCAR,I didn’t know when I was ten. It happened one day in a hotel in
2536,OSCAR,"Southampton—a dark place, gloomy, smelling frightfully of mildew, the"
2537,OSCAR,"walls were damp and stained. A strange place, eh, to learn the delights"
2538,OSCAR,"of love, but then our parents seldom dwell on the delights,—they are too"
2539,OSCAR,"taken up with the sordid details, the mere sordid details. My father had"
2540,OSCAR,"a great beard, and I remember thinking that it would have been better if"
2541,OSCAR,he hadn’t said such things. I wasn’t much good afterwards for five or
2542,OSCAR,"six years, but my sister was different. She enjoyed it immensely and"
2543,OSCAR,"forgot all about it almost immediately, excepting when I reminded her.”"
2544,OSCAR,
2545,OSCAR,"“Go to bed, Oscar,” Emma said abruptly."
2546,OSCAR,
2547,OSCAR,"He went, and on going up the steps he did not let his fingers trail"
2548,OSCAR,"along the spindles of the banisters with his usual “Eeny meeny miny mo,”"
2549,OSCAR,etc.
2550,OSCAR,
2551,OSCAR,"Emma was a little troubled and watched him going up silently, hardly"
2552,OSCAR,moving his arms.
2553,OSCAR,
2554,OSCAR,"“Children should be treated very carefully, they should know as much as"
2555,OSCAR,"possible, but in a less superficial form than they must know later.”"
2556,OSCAR,
2557,OSCAR,"“I think a child is born corrupt and attains to decency,” Straussmann"
2558,OSCAR,said grinning.
2559,OSCAR,
2560,OSCAR,"“If you please,” Emma cried gaily, “we will talk about things we"
2561,OSCAR,understand.”
2562,OSCAR,
2563,OSCAR,"Kahn smiled. “It’s beautiful, really beautiful,” he said, meaning her"
2564,OSCAR,gaiety. He always said complimentary things about her lightness of
2565,OSCAR,"spirit, and always in an angry voice."
2566,OSCAR,
2567,OSCAR,"“Come, come, you are going mad. What’s the good of that?” she said,"
2568,OSCAR,"abruptly, thinking, “He is a man who discovered himself once too often.”"
2569,OSCAR,
2570,OSCAR,"“You are wrong, Emma, I am not worthy of madness.”"
2571,OSCAR,
2572,OSCAR,"“Don’t be on your guard, Kahn,” she retorted."
2573,OSCAR,
2574,OSCAR,"Oscar appeared before her suddenly, barefoot. She stared at him. “What"
2575,OSCAR,is it?” she at last managed to ask in a faint almost suffocated voice.
2576,OSCAR,
2577,OSCAR,"“I want to kiss you,” he whispered."
2578,OSCAR,
2579,OSCAR,"She moved toward him slowly, when, half way, he hurried toward her,"
2580,OSCAR,"seized her hand, kissed it, and went back into the house."
2581,OSCAR,
2582,OSCAR,"“My God,” she cried out. “He is beginning to think for himself,” and ran"
2583,OSCAR,in after him.
2584,OSCAR,
2585,OSCAR,"She remembered how she had talked to him the night before, only the"
2586,OSCAR,"night before. “You must love with an everlasting but a changing love,”"
2587,OSCAR,and he became restless. “With an everlasting but a changing love.”
2588,OSCAR,
2589,OSCAR,"“What do you mean by ‘changing’?” His palms were moist, and his feet"
2590,OSCAR,twitched.
2591,OSCAR,
2592,OSCAR,"“A love that takes in every detail, every element—that can understand"
2593,OSCAR,"without hating, without distinction, I think.”"
2594,OSCAR,
2595,OSCAR,"“Why do you say, ‘I think’?”"
2596,OSCAR,
2597,OSCAR,"“I mean, I know,” she answered, confused."
2598,OSCAR,
2599,OSCAR,"“Get that Kahn out, he’s a rascal,” he said, abruptly, grinning."
2600,OSCAR,
2601,OSCAR,"“What are you saying, Oscar?” she demanded, turning cold. “I’ll never"
2602,OSCAR,"come to your bed again, take your hands and say ‘Our Father.’”"
2603,OSCAR,
2604,OSCAR,"“It will be all right if you send that man packing,” he said, stressing"
2605,OSCAR,the word “packing.”
2606,OSCAR,
2607,OSCAR,"She was very angry, and half started toward the door. Then she turned"
2608,OSCAR,"back. “Why do you say that, Oscar?”"
2609,OSCAR,
2610,OSCAR,"“Because he makes you nervous—well, then—because he crouches”; he saw by"
2611,OSCAR,"his mother’s face that she was annoyed, puzzled, and he turned red to"
2612,OSCAR,"his ears. “I don’t mean that, I mean he isn’t good; he’s just watching"
2613,OSCAR,"for something good to happen, to take place——” His voice trailed off,"
2614,OSCAR,and he raised his eyes solemn and full of tears to her face. She leaned
2615,OSCAR,"down and kissed him, tucking him in like a “little boy.”"
2616,OSCAR,
2617,OSCAR,"“But I’m not a little boy,” he called out to her."
2618,OSCAR,
2619,OSCAR,And tonight she did not come down until she thought Kahn and Straussmann
2620,OSCAR,had gone.
2621,OSCAR,
2622,OSCAR,"Kahn had disappeared, but Straussmann had taken a turn or two about the"
2623,OSCAR,place and was standing in the shadow of the stoop when she came out.
2624,OSCAR,
2625,OSCAR,"“Come,” he said. “What is it that you want?”"
2626,OSCAR,
2627,OSCAR,"“I think it’s religion,” she answered abruptly. “But it’s probably"
2628,OSCAR,love.”
2629,OSCAR,
2630,OSCAR,"“Let us take a walk,” he suggested."
2631,OSCAR,
2632,OSCAR,They turned in toward the shadows of the great still mountains and the
2633,OSCAR,"denser, more arrogant shadows of the out-houses and barns. She looked"
2634,OSCAR,"away into the silence, and the night, and a warm sensation as of"
2635,OSCAR,"pleasure or of something expected but intangible came over her, and she"
2636,OSCAR,"wanted to laugh, to cry, and thinking of it she knew that it was"
2637,OSCAR,neither.
2638,OSCAR,
2639,OSCAR,"She was almost unconscious of him for a little, thinking of her son. She"
2640,OSCAR,raised her long silk skirts about her ankles and tramped off into the
2641,OSCAR,dampness. A whippoorwill was whistling off to the right. It sounded as
2642,OSCAR,"if he were on the fence, and Emma stopped and tried to make it out. She"
2643,OSCAR,"took Ulric’s arm presently, and feeling his muscles swell began to think"
2644,OSCAR,of the Bible. “Those who take by the sword shall die by the sword. And
2645,OSCAR,those who live by the flesh shall die by the flesh.”
2646,OSCAR,
2647,OSCAR,She wished that she had someone she could believe in. She saw a door
2648,OSCAR,"before her mental eye, and herself opening it and saying, “Now tell me"
2649,OSCAR,"this, and what it means,—only today I was thinking ‘those who live by"
2650,OSCAR,the flesh’”—and as suddenly the door was slammed in her face. She
2651,OSCAR,started back.
2652,OSCAR,
2653,OSCAR,"“You are nervous,” he said in a pleased whisper."
2654,OSCAR,
2655,OSCAR,Heavy stagnant shadows sprawled in the path. “So many million leaves and
2656,OSCAR,"twigs to make one dark shadow,” she said, and was sorry because it"
2657,OSCAR,"sounded childishly romantic, quite different from what she had intended,"
2658,OSCAR,what she had meant.
2659,OSCAR,
2660,OSCAR,"They turned the corner of the carriage-house. Something moved, a toad,"
2661,OSCAR,"grey and ugly, bounced across her feet and into the darkness of the"
2662,OSCAR,hedges. Coming to the entrance of the barn they paused. They could
2663,OSCAR,"distinguish sleeping hens, the white films moving on their eyes—and"
2664,OSCAR,"through a window at the back, steam rising from the dung heap."
2665,OSCAR,
2666,OSCAR,"“There don’t seem to be any real farmers left,” she said aloud, thinking"
2667,OSCAR,of some book she had read about the troubles of the peasants and
2668,OSCAR,landholders.
2669,OSCAR,
2670,OSCAR,"“You’re thinking of my country,” he said smiling."
2671,OSCAR,
2672,OSCAR,"“No, I wasn’t,” she said. “I was wondering what it is about the country"
2673,OSCAR,that makes it seem so terrible?”
2674,OSCAR,
2675,OSCAR,“It’s your being a Puritan—a tight-laced delightful little Puritan.”
2676,OSCAR,
2677,OSCAR,"She winced at the words, and decided to remain silent."
2678,OSCAR,
2679,OSCAR,"It was true, Straussmann was in a fever of excitement—he was always this"
2680,OSCAR,"way with women, especially with Emma. He tried to conceal it for the"
2681,OSCAR,"time being, thinking, rightly, that a display of it would not please her"
2682,OSCAR,just at the moment—“but it would be only a matter of minutes when she
2683,OSCAR,"would welcome it,” he promised himself, and waited."
2684,OSCAR,
2685,OSCAR,He reflected that she would laugh at him. “But she would enjoy it just
2686,OSCAR,the same. The way with all women who have had anything to do with more
2687,OSCAR,"than one man and are not yet forty,” he reflected. “They like what they"
2688,OSCAR,"get, but they laugh at you, and know you are lying——”"
2689,OSCAR,
2690,OSCAR,"“Oh, my God!” Emma said suddenly, drawing her arm away and wiping her"
2691,OSCAR,face with her handkerchief.
2692,OSCAR,
2693,OSCAR,“What’s the matter?”
2694,OSCAR,
2695,OSCAR,"“Nothing, it’s the heat.”"
2696,OSCAR,
2697,OSCAR,"“It is warm,” he said dismally."
2698,OSCAR,
2699,OSCAR,"“I despise everything, I really despise everything, but you won’t"
2700,OSCAR,believe—— I mean everything when I say everything—you’ll think I mean
2701,OSCAR,some one thing—won’t you?” she went on hurriedly. She felt that she was
2702,OSCAR,becoming hysterical.
2703,OSCAR,
2704,OSCAR,"“It doesn’t matter,” he rejoined, walking on beside her, his heart"
2705,OSCAR,"beating violently. “Down, you dog,” he said aloud."
2706,OSCAR,
2707,OSCAR,"“What is that?” She raised her eyes and he looked into them, and they"
2708,OSCAR,both smiled.
2709,OSCAR,
2710,OSCAR,“That’s better. I wish I were God.”
2711,OSCAR,
2712,OSCAR,“A desire for a vocation.”
2713,OSCAR,
2714,OSCAR,"“Not true, and horrid, as usual,” she answered, and she was hot and"
2715,OSCAR,angry all at once.
2716,OSCAR,
2717,OSCAR,"He pulled at his moustache and sniffed. “I can smell the hedges—ah, the"
2718,OSCAR,"country is a gay deceiver—it smells pleasant enough, but it’s"
2719,OSCAR,"treacherous. The country, my dear Emma, has done more to corrupt man, to"
2720,OSCAR,"drag him down, to turn him loose upon his lower instincts, than"
2721,OSCAR,"morphine, alcohol and women. That’s why I like it, that’s why it’s the"
2722,OSCAR,"perfect place for women. They are devils and should be driven out, and"
2723,OSCAR,as there’s more room in the country and consequently less likelihood of
2724,OSCAR,"driving them out in too much of a hurry, there is more time for"
2725,OSCAR,amusement.” He watched her out of the corner of his eye as he said these
2726,OSCAR,"things to note if they were ill advised. They seemed to leave her cold,"
2727,OSCAR,but tense.
2728,OSCAR,
2729,OSCAR,A little later they passed the barns again.
2730,OSCAR,
2731,OSCAR,“What was that?” Emma asked suddenly.
2732,OSCAR,
2733,OSCAR,“I heard nothing.”
2734,OSCAR,
2735,OSCAR,"But she had heard something, and her heart beat fearfully. She"
2736,OSCAR,recognized Oscar’s voice. She reached up signing Straussmann to be
2737,OSCAR,quiet. She did not want him to hear; she wished that the ground would
2738,OSCAR,"yawn, would swallow him up."
2739,OSCAR,
2740,OSCAR,"“See that yellow flower down there,” she said, pointing toward the end"
2741,OSCAR,"of the path they had just come. “I want it, I must have it, please.” He"
2742,OSCAR,"did as he was bid, amiably enough."
2743,OSCAR,
2744,OSCAR,She listened—she heard the voice of Oscar’s little sweetheart:
2745,OSCAR,
2746,OSCAR,"“It seems as if we were one already.”... It was high, resolute,"
2747,OSCAR,"unflagging, without emotion, a childish parroting of some novel. Oscar’s"
2748,OSCAR,"voice came back, half smothered:"
2749,OSCAR,
2750,OSCAR,“Do you really care—more than you like Berkeley?”
2751,OSCAR,
2752,OSCAR,"“Yes, I do,” she answered in the same false treble, “lots more.”"
2753,OSCAR,
2754,OSCAR,"“Come here,” he said softly—the hay rustled."
2755,OSCAR,
2756,OSCAR,“I don’t want to—the rye gets into my hair and spoils it.”
2757,OSCAR,
2758,OSCAR,"“Dolly, do you like the country?”"
2759,OSCAR,
2760,OSCAR,"“Yes, I do,”—without conviction."
2761,OSCAR,
2762,OSCAR,"“We will go to the city,” he answered."
2763,OSCAR,
2764,OSCAR,"“Oh, Oscar, you’re so strong,” she giggled, and it sent a cold shudder"
2765,OSCAR,through Emma’s being.
2766,OSCAR,
2767,OSCAR,"Then presently, “What’s the matter, Oscar—why, you’re crying.”"
2768,OSCAR,
2769,OSCAR,"“I’m not—well, then yes, I am—what of it?—you’ll understand, too, some"
2770,OSCAR,day.”
2771,OSCAR,
2772,OSCAR,"She was evidently frightened, because she said in a somewhat loosened"
2773,OSCAR,"key, “No one would ever believe that we were as much in love as we are,"
2774,OSCAR,"would they, Oscar?”"
2775,OSCAR,
2776,OSCAR,"“No, why do you ask that?”"
2777,OSCAR,
2778,OSCAR,"“It’s a great pity,” she said again with the false sound, and sighed."
2779,OSCAR,
2780,OSCAR,“Do you care? Why do you care?”
2781,OSCAR,
2782,OSCAR,Straussmann was coming back with the yellow flower between thumb and
2783,OSCAR,forefinger. Emma ran a little way to meet him.
2784,OSCAR,
2785,OSCAR,"“Come, let us go home the other way.”"
2786,OSCAR,
2787,OSCAR,"“Rather, let us not go home,” he said, boldly, and took her wrist,"
2788,OSCAR,hurting her.
2789,OSCAR,
2790,OSCAR,"“Ah,” she said. “Vous m’avez blessée d’amour”—ironically."
2791,OSCAR,
2792,OSCAR,"“Yes, speak French, it helps women like you at such moments,” he said,"
2793,OSCAR,"brutally, and kissed her."
2794,OSCAR,
2795,OSCAR,"But kissing him back, she thought, “The fool, why does Oscar take her so"
2796,OSCAR,"seriously when they are both children, and she is torturing him.”"
2797,OSCAR,
2798,OSCAR,"“My love, my sweet, my little love,” he was babbling."
2799,OSCAR,
2800,OSCAR,"She tried to quench this, trembling a little. “But tell me, my"
2801,OSCAR,"friend—no, not so hasty—what do you think of immortality?” He had pushed"
2802,OSCAR,"her so far back that there was no regaining her composure. “My God, in"
2803,OSCAR,"other words, what of the will to retribution!”"
2804,OSCAR,
2805,OSCAR,"But she could not go on. “I’ve tried to,” she thought."
2806,OSCAR,
2807,OSCAR,"Later, when the dawn was almost upon them, he said: “How sad to be"
2808,OSCAR,"drunk, only to die. For the end of all man is Fate, in other words, the"
2809,OSCAR,end of all man is vulgar.”
2810,OSCAR,
2811,OSCAR,She felt the need of something that had not been.
2812,OSCAR,
2813,OSCAR,"“I’m not God, you see, after all.”"
2814,OSCAR,
2815,OSCAR,"“So I see, madam,” he said. “But you’re a damned clever little woman.”"
2816,OSCAR,
2817,OSCAR,"When she came in, she found Kahn lying flat on his back, his eyes wide"
2818,OSCAR,open.
2819,OSCAR,
2820,OSCAR,“Couldn’t you sleep?”
2821,OSCAR,
2822,OSCAR,"“No, I could not sleep.”"
2823,OSCAR,
2824,OSCAR,She was angry. “I’m sorry—you suffer.”
2825,OSCAR,
2826,OSCAR,"“Yes, a little.”"
2827,OSCAR,
2828,OSCAR,"“Kahn,” she cried in anguish, flinging herself on her knees beside him."
2829,OSCAR,"“What should I have done, what shall I do?”"
2830,OSCAR,
2831,OSCAR,"He put his hand on her cheek. “My dear, my dear,” he said, and sighed."
2832,OSCAR,“I perhaps was wrong.”
2833,OSCAR,
2834,OSCAR,She listened.
2835,OSCAR,
2836,OSCAR,"“Very wrong, I see it all now; I am an evil man, an old and an evil"
2837,OSCAR,being.”
2838,OSCAR,
2839,OSCAR,"“No, no!”"
2840,OSCAR,
2841,OSCAR,"“Yes, yes,” he said gently, softly, contradicting her. “Yes, evil, and"
2842,OSCAR,"pitiful, and weak”; he seemed to be trying to remember something. “What"
2843,OSCAR,is it that I have overlooked?” He asked the question in such a confused
2844,OSCAR,voice that she was startled.
2845,OSCAR,
2846,OSCAR,“Is it hate?” she asked.
2847,OSCAR,
2848,OSCAR,"“I guess so, yes, I guess that’s it.”"
2849,OSCAR,
2850,OSCAR,"“Kahn, try to think—there must be something else.”"
2851,OSCAR,
2852,OSCAR,“Madness.”
2853,OSCAR,
2854,OSCAR,She began to shiver.
2855,OSCAR,
2856,OSCAR,“Are you cold?”
2857,OSCAR,
2858,OSCAR,"“No, it’s not cold.”"
2859,OSCAR,
2860,OSCAR,"“No, it’s not cold,” he repeated after her. “You are not cold, Emma, you"
2861,OSCAR,are a child.”
2862,OSCAR,
2863,OSCAR,Tears began to roll down her cheeks.
2864,OSCAR,
2865,OSCAR,"“Yes,” he continued sadly. “You too will hear: remorse is the medium"
2866,OSCAR,through which the evil spirit takes possession.”
2867,OSCAR,
2868,OSCAR,And again he cried out in anguish. “But I’m _not_ superficial—I may have
2869,OSCAR,"been wanton, but I’ve not been superficial. I wanted to give up"
2870,OSCAR,"everything, to abandon myself to whatever IT demanded, to do whatever IT"
2871,OSCAR,directed and willed. But the terrible thing is I don’t know what abandon
2872,OSCAR,is. I don’t know when it’s abandon and when it’s just a case of minor
2873,OSCAR,calculation.
2874,OSCAR,
2875,OSCAR,“The real abandon is not to know whether one throws oneself off a cliff
2876,OSCAR,"or not, and not to care. But I can’t do it, because I must know, because"
2877,OSCAR,"I’m afraid if I did cast myself off, I should find that I had thrown"
2878,OSCAR,"myself off the lesser thing after all, and that,” he said in a horrified"
2879,OSCAR,"voice, “I could never outlive, I could never have faith again. And so it"
2880,OSCAR,"is that I shall never know, Emma; only children and the naïve know, and"
2881,OSCAR,I am too sophisticated to accomplish the divine descent.”
2882,OSCAR,
2883,OSCAR,"“But you must tell me,” she said, hurriedly. “What am I to do, what am I"
2884,OSCAR,"to think? My whole future depends on that, on your answer—on knowing"
2885,OSCAR,"whether I do an injustice not to hate, not to strike, not to kill—well,"
2886,OSCAR,you must tell me—I swear it is my life—my entire life.”
2887,OSCAR,
2888,OSCAR,"“Don’t ask me, I can’t know, I can’t tell. I who could not lead one"
2889,OSCAR,"small sheep, what could I do with a soul, and what still more could I do"
2890,OSCAR,"with you? No,” he continued, “I’m so incapable. I am so mystified. Death"
2891,OSCAR,"would be a release, but it wouldn’t settle anything. It never settles"
2892,OSCAR,"anything, it simply wipes the slate, it’s merely a way of putting the"
2893,OSCAR,"sum out of mind, yet I wish I might die. How do I know now but that"
2894,OSCAR,"everything I have thought, and said, and done, has not been false, a"
2895,OSCAR,little abyss from which I shall crawl laughing at the evil of my own
2896,OSCAR,limitation.”
2897,OSCAR,
2898,OSCAR,“But the child—what have I been telling Oscar—to love with an
2899,OSCAR,everlasting love——”
2900,OSCAR,
2901,OSCAR,"“That’s true,” he said."
2902,OSCAR,
2903,OSCAR,"“Kahn, listen. What have I done to him, what have I done to myself?"
2904,OSCAR,What are we all doing here—are we all mad—or are we merely
2905,OSCAR,"excited—overwrought, hysterical? I must know, I must know.” She took"
2906,OSCAR,his hand and he felt her tears upon it.
2907,OSCAR,
2908,OSCAR,"“Kahn, is it an everlasting but a changing love—what kind of love is"
2909,OSCAR,that?”
2910,OSCAR,
2911,OSCAR,"“Perhaps that’s it,” he cried, jumping up, and with a gesture tore his"
2912,OSCAR,"shirt open at the throat. “Look, I want you to see, I run upon the world"
2913,OSCAR,"with a bared breast—but never find the blade—ah, the civility of our own"
2914,OSCAR,"damnation—that’s the horror. A few years ago, surely this could not have"
2915,OSCAR,"happened. Do you know,” he said, turning his eyes all hot and burning"
2916,OSCAR,"upon her, “the most terrible thing in the world is to bare the breast"
2917,OSCAR,and never to feel the blade enter!” He buried his face in his hands.
2918,OSCAR,
2919,OSCAR,"“But, Kahn, you must think, you must give me an answer. All this"
2920,OSCAR,"indecision is all very well for us, for all of us who are too old to"
2921,OSCAR,"change, for all of us who can reach God through some plaything we have"
2922,OSCAR,"used as a symbol, but there’s my son, what is he to think, to feel, he"
2923,OSCAR,"has no jester’s stick to shake, nor stool to stand on. Am I responsible"
2924,OSCAR,"for him? Why,” she cried frantically, “must I be responsible for him? I"
2925,OSCAR,"tell you I won’t be, I can’t. I won’t take it upon myself. But I have, I"
2926,OSCAR,have. Is there something that can make me immune to my own blood? Tell
2927,OSCAR,me—I must wipe the slate—the fingers are driving me mad—can’t he stand
2928,OSCAR,"alone now? Oh, Kahn, Kahn!” she cried, kissing his hands. “See, I kiss"
2929,OSCAR,"your hands, I am doing so much. You must be the prophet—you can’t do"
2930,OSCAR,"less for the sign I give you—I must know, I must receive an answer, I"
2931,OSCAR,_will_ receive it.”
2932,OSCAR,
2933,OSCAR,"He shook her off suddenly, a look of fear came into his eyes."
2934,OSCAR,
2935,OSCAR,"“Are you trying to frighten me?” he whispered. She went into the hall,"
2936,OSCAR,"into the dark, and did not know why, or understand anything. Her mind"
2937,OSCAR,"was on fire, and it was consuming things that were strange and merciful"
2938,OSCAR,and precious.
2939,OSCAR,
2940,OSCAR,Finally she went into her son’s room and stood before his bed. He lay
2941,OSCAR,"with one feverish cheek against a dirty hand, his knees drawn up; his"
2942,OSCAR,mouth had a peculiar look of surprise about it.
2943,OSCAR,
2944,OSCAR,"She bent down, called to him, not knowing what she was doing. “Wrong,"
2945,OSCAR,"wrong,” she whispered, and she shook him by the shoulders. “Listen,"
2946,OSCAR,"Oscar, get up. Listen to me!”"
2947,OSCAR,
2948,OSCAR,"He awoke and cried out as one of her tears, forgotten, cold, struck"
2949,OSCAR,against his cheek. An ague shook his limbs. She brought her face close
2950,OSCAR,to his.
2951,OSCAR,
2952,OSCAR,"“Son, hate too, that is inevitable—irrevocable——”"
2953,OSCAR,
2954,OSCAR,He put out his two hands and pushed them against her breast and in a
2955,OSCAR,"subdued voice said, “Go away, go away,” and he looked as if he were"
2956,OSCAR,"about to cry, but he did not cry."
2957,OSCAR,
2958,OSCAR,She turned and fled into the hall.
2959,OSCAR,
2960,OSCAR,"However, in the morning, at breakfast, there was nothing unusual about"
2961,OSCAR,"her, but a tired softness and yielding of spirit; and at dinner, which"
2962,OSCAR,"was always late, she felt only a weary indifference when she saw"
2963,OSCAR,Straussmann coming up the walk. He had a red and white handkerchief
2964,OSCAR,"about his throat, and she thought, “How comic he looks.”"
2965,OSCAR,
2966,OSCAR,"“Good evening,” he said."
2967,OSCAR,
2968,OSCAR,"“Good evening,” she answered, and a touch of her old gaiety came into"
2969,OSCAR,"her voice. Kahn was already seated, and now she motioned Straussmann to"
2970,OSCAR,follow. She began slicing the cold potted beef and asked them about
2971,OSCAR,"sugar in their tea, adding, “Oscar will be here soon.” To Kahn she"
2972,OSCAR,"showed only a very little trace of coldness, of indecision."
2973,OSCAR,
2974,OSCAR,"“No,” Straussmann said, still standing, legs apart: “If you’ll excuse"
2975,OSCAR,"me, I’d like a word or two with Kahn.” They stepped off the porch"
2976,OSCAR,together.
2977,OSCAR,
2978,OSCAR,"“Kahn,” he said, going directly to the point, “listen,” he took hold of"
2979,OSCAR,"Kahn’s coat by the lapel. “You have known Emma longer than I have,"
2980,OSCAR,you’ve got to break it to her.” He flourished a large key under Kahn’s
2981,OSCAR,"nose, as he spoke."
2982,OSCAR,
2983,OSCAR,"“I’ve got him locked up in the out-house safe enough for the present,"
2984,OSCAR,but we must do something immediately.”
2985,OSCAR,
2986,OSCAR,"“What’s the matter?” A strange, pleasant but cold sweat broke out upon"
2987,OSCAR,Kahn’s forehead.
2988,OSCAR,
2989,OSCAR,"“I found Oscar sitting beside the body of his sweetheart,"
2990,OSCAR,"what’s-her-name; he had cut her throat with a kitchen knife, yes, with a"
2991,OSCAR,"kitchen knife—he seemed calm, but he would say nothing. What shall we"
2992,OSCAR,do?”
2993,OSCAR,
2994,OSCAR,“They’ll say he was a degenerate from the start——”
2995,OSCAR,
2996,OSCAR,“Those who live by the flesh—eh?”
2997,OSCAR,
2998,OSCAR,"“No,” Kahn said, in a confused voice, “that’s not it.”"
2999,OSCAR,
3000,OSCAR,They stood and stared at each other so long that presently Emma grew
3001,OSCAR,nervous and came down the garden path to hear what it was all about.

3032,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“We have eaten a great deal, my friend, against the day of God.”"
3033,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3034,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"She was a fine woman, hard, magnificent, cold, Russian, married to a"
3035,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"Jew, a doctor on the East Side."
3036,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3037,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"You know that kind of woman, pale, large, with a heavy oval face."
3038,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3039,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"A woman of ‘material’—a lasting personality, in other words, a"
3040,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"‘fashionable’ woman, a woman who, had she lived to the age of forty odd,"
3041,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"would have sat for long fine hours by some window, overlooking some"
3042,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"desolate park, thinking of a beautiful but lazy means to an end."
3043,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3044,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"She always wore large and stylish hats, and beneath them her mouth took"
3045,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"on a look of pain at once proud, aristocratic and lonely."
3046,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3047,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,She had studied medicine—but medicine in the interest of animals; she
3048,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,was a good horse doctor—an excellent surgeon on the major injuries to
3049,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,birds and dogs.
3050,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3051,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,In fact she and her husband had met in a medical college in Russia—she
3052,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"had been the only woman in the class, the only one of the lot of them"
3053,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"who smiled in a strange, hurt and sarcastic way when dissecting."
3054,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3055,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"The men treated her like one of them, that is, they had no cringing"
3056,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"mannerliness about their approach, they lost no poise before her, and"
3057,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,tried no tricks as one might say.
3058,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3059,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"The Silverstaffs had come to America, they had settled on the East Side,"
3060,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,among ‘their own people’ as he would say; she never said anything when
3061,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"he talked like this, she sat passive, her hands in her lap, but her"
3062,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"nostrils quivered, and somewhere under the skin of her cheek something"
3063,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,trembled.
3064,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3065,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"Her husband was the typical Jewish intellectual, a man with stiff,"
3066,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"short, greying hair, prominent intelligent and kindly eyes, rather"
3067,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"short, rather round, always smelling of Greek salad and carbolic acid,"
3068,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"and always intensely interested in new medical journals, theories,"
3069,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,discoveries.
3070,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3071,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"He was a little dusty, a little careless, a little timid, but always"
3072,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,gentle.
3073,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3074,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,They had been in America scarcely eight months before the first child
3075,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"was born, a girl, and then following on her heels a boy, and then no"
3076,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,more children.
3077,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3078,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,Katrina Silverstaff stopped having her children as abruptly as she had
3079,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"begun having them; something complicated had entered her mind, and where"
3080,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"there are definite complications of the kind that she suffered, there"
3081,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,are no more children.
3082,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3083,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“We have eaten a great deal, my friend, against the day of God,” she had"
3084,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,said that.
3085,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3086,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"She had said that one night, sitting in the dusk of their office. There"
3087,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,was something inexpressibly funny in their sitting together in this
3088,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"office, with its globe of the world, its lung charts, its weighing"
3089,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"machine, its surgical chair, and its bowl of ineffectual goldfish."
3090,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"Something inexpressibly funny and inexpressibly fecund, a fecundity"
3091,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"suppressed by coldness, and a terrible determination—more terrible in"
3092,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,that her husband Otto felt nothing of it.
3093,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3094,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"He was very fond of her, and had he been a little more sensitive he"
3095,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,would have been very glad to be proud of her. She never became
3096,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"confidential with him, and he never tried to overstep this, partly"
3097,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"because he was unaware of it, and partly because he felt little need of"
3098,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,a closer companionship.
3099,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3100,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"She was a fine woman, he knew that; he never thought to question"
3101,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"anything she did, because it was little, nor what she said, because it"
3102,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,was less; there was an economy about her existence that simply forbade
3103,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"questioning. He felt in some dim way, that to criticize at all would be"
3104,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,to stop everything.
3105,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3106,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,Their life was typical of the East Side doctor’s life. Patients all day
3107,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"for him, and the children for her, with an occasional call from someone"
3108,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,who had a sick bird. In the evening they would sit around a table with
3109,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"just sufficient food, with just sufficient silver and linen, and one"
3110,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,luxury: Katrina’s glass of white wine.
3111,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3112,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"Or sometimes they would go out to dine, to some kosher place, where"
3113,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"everyone was too friendly and too ugly and too warm, and here he would"
3114,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,talk of the day’s diseases while she listened to the music and tried not
3115,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,to hear what her daughter was crying for.
3116,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3117,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"He had always been a ‘liberal,’ from the first turn of the cradle. In"
3118,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"the freedom of the people, in the betterment of conditions, he took the"
3119,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,interest a doctor takes in seeing a wound heal.
3120,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3121,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"As for Katrina Silverstaff, she never said anything about it, he never"
3122,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"knew what she really thought, if she thought at all; it did not seem"
3123,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"necessary for her to do or say anything, she was fine as she was, where"
3124,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,she was. On the other hand it never occurred to him that she would not
3125,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"hear, with calmness at least, his long dissertations on capital."
3126,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3127,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"At the opening of this story, Katrina’s daughter was a little girl of"
3128,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"ten, who was devoted to dancing, and who lay awake at nights worrying"
3129,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"about the shape of her legs, which had already begun to swell with a"
3130,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,dancer’s muscles.
3131,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3132,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"The boy was nine, thin, and wore spectacles."
3133,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3134,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,And of course what happened was quite unaccountable.
3135,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3136,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"A man, calling himself Castillion Rodkin, passed through one Summer,"
3137,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,selling Carlyle’s “French Revolution.” Among the houses where he had
3138,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,left a copy was the house of Otto Silverstaff.
3139,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3140,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"Katrina had opened the door, the maid was down with the measles, and the"
3141,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"doctor was busy with a patient, a Jew much revered for his poetry."
3142,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3143,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"She never bought anything of peddlers, and she seldom said more than"
3144,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“No, thank you.” In this case she neither said “Thank you,” nor closed"
3145,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"the door—instead she held it open, standing a little aside for him to"
3146,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"pass, and, utterly astonished, he did pass, waiting behind her in the"
3147,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,hall for orders.
3148,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3149,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“We will go into the study,” she said, “my husband is busy.”"
3150,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3151,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“I was selling Bibles last year,” he remarked, “but they do not go down"
3152,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,in this section.”
3153,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3154,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“Yes,” she answered, “I see,” and she moved before him into the heavy"
3155,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,damp parlour which was never unshuttered and which was never used. She
3156,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,reached up and turned on one solitary electric light.
3157,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3158,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,Castillion Rodkin might have been of any nationality in the world; this
3159,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"was partly from having travelled in all countries, and also from a fluid"
3160,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"temperament—little was fixed or firm in him, a necessary quality in a"
3161,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,salesman.
3162,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3163,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"Castillion Rodkin was below medium height, thin and bearded with a pale,"
3164,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"almost white growth of hair. He was peculiarly colourless, his eyes were"
3165,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"only a shade darker than his temples, and very restless."
3166,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3167,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"She said simply, “We must talk about religion.”"
3168,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3169,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,And with an awkwardness unusual to him he asked “Why?”
3170,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3171,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“Because,” she said in a strained voice, making a hurt gesture, “it is"
3172,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,so far from me.”
3173,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3174,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"He did not know what to say, of course, and lifting one thin leg in its"
3175,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,white trousers he placed it carefully over the other.
3176,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3177,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"She was sitting opposite him, her head turned a little to one side, not"
3178,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"looking at anything. “You see,” she said presently, “I want religion to"
3179,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,become out of the reach of the few.”
3180,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3181,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“Become’s a queer word,” he said."
3182,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3183,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“It is the only word,” she answered, and there was a slight irritation"
3184,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"in her voice, “because it is so irrevocably for the many.”"
3185,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3186,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“Yes,” he said mechanically, and reached up to his beard, leaving his"
3187,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,hand there under a few strands of hair.
3188,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3189,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“You see,” she went on simply, “I can come to the point. For me,"
3190,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,everything is a lie—I am not telling this to you because I need your
3191,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"help, I shall never need help,” she said, turning her eyes on his,"
3192,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“understand that from the beginning——”
3193,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3194,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“Beginning,” he said in a loud voice suddenly."
3195,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3196,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“From the beginning,” she repeated calmly, “right from the very start,"
3197,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"not help but hindrance, I need enough hindrance, a total obstacle,"
3198,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,otherwise I cannot accomplish it.”
3199,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3200,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“Accomplish what, madame?” he asked and took his hand from under his"
3201,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,beard.
3202,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3203,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“That is my affair, mine alone, that you must not question, it has"
3204,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"nothing to do with you, you are only a means to an end.”"
3205,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3206,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"He said, “What can I do for you?”"
3207,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3208,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"She smiled, a sudden smile, and under her cheek something flickered."
3209,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“You can do nothing,” she said and stood up. “I must always do it"
3210,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"all—yes, I shall be your mistress—wait,” she said raising her hand, and"
3211,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"there was anger and pride in her. “Do not intrude now by word or sign,"
3212,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"but tomorrow you will come to me—that is enough—that is all you can do,”"
3213,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,and in this word “all” he felt a limit on himself that he had never
3214,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"known before, and he was frightened and disquieted and unhappy."
3215,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3216,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"He came the next day, cringing a little, fawning, uneasy, and she would"
3217,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"not see him—she sent word “I do not need you yet,” and he called again"
3218,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"the next day and learned that she was out of town, then one Sunday she"
3219,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,was in to him.
3220,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3221,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"She said quietly to him, as if she were preparing him for a great"
3222,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"disappointment, “I have deliberately, very deliberately, removed remorse"
3223,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"from the forbidden fruit,” and he was abject suddenly and trembling."
3224,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3225,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“There will be no thorns for you,” she went on in a cold abrupt voice."
3226,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“You will miss that, but do not presume to show it in my presence.”"
3227,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3228,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“Also my floor is not the floor on which you may crawl,” she continued,"
3229,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“and I do not permit you to suffer while I am in the room—and,” she"
3230,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"added, unfastening her brooch slowly and precisely, “I dislike all"
3231,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,spiritual odours.”
3232,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3233,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“Are we all strange?” he whispered.
3234,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3235,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“It takes more than will to attain to madness.”
3236,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3237,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“Yes.”
3238,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3239,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"Then she was silent for a while, thinking."
3240,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3241,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“I want to suffer,” he murmured, and trembled again."
3242,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3243,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“We are all gross at times, but this is not your time.”"
3244,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3245,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“I could follow you into the wilderness.”
3246,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3247,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“I would not miss you.”
3248,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3249,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,And it was said in a terrible forbidding voice.
3250,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3251,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“I suffer as a birthright—I want it to be something more my own than
3252,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,that.”
3253,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3254,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“What are you going to do?” he said.
3255,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3256,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“Does one ever destroy oneself who is utterly disinterested?”
3257,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3258,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“I don’t know.”
3259,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3260,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"Presently she said, “I love my husband—I want you to know that, it"
3261,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"doesn’t matter, but I want you to know that, and that I am content with"
3262,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"him, and quite happy——”"
3263,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3264,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“Yes,” Castillion Rodkin answered and began trembling again, holding on"
3265,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,to the sides of the bed.
3266,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3267,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“But there is something in me,” she continued, “that is very mournful"
3268,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,because it is being.”
3269,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3270,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,He could not answer and tears came to his eyes.
3271,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3272,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“There is another thing,” she said with abrupt roughness, “that I must"
3273,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"insist on, that is that you will not insult me by your presence while"
3274,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,you are in this room.”
3275,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3276,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"He tried to stop his weeping now, and his body grew tense, abject."
3277,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3278,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“You see,” she continued, “some people drink poison, some take a knife,"
3279,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,and others drown; I take you.”
3280,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3281,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"In the very early dawn, she sat up with a strange smile. “Will you"
3282,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"smoke?” she said, and lit him a cigarette. Then she withdrew into"
3283,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"herself, sitting on the edge of the mahogany boards, her hands in her"
3284,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,lap.
3285,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3286,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"And there was a little ease, and a little comfort in Castillion Rodkin,"
3287,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"and he turned, drawing up one foot, thrusting his hand beneath his"
3288,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"beard, slowly smoking his cigarette."
3289,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3290,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“Does one regret?” he asked, and the figure of Katrina never moved, nor"
3291,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,did she seem to hear.
3292,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3293,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“You know, you frightened me—last night,” he went on, lying on his back"
3294,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,now and looking at the ceiling. “I almost became something—something.”
3295,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3296,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,There was a long silence.
3297,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3298,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“Shall the beasts of the field and the birds of the air forsake thee?”
3299,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"he said gloomily, then brightly. “Shall any man forsake thee?”"
3300,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3301,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"Katrina Silverstaff remained as she was, but under her cheek something"
3302,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,quivered.
3303,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3304,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,The dawn was very near and the street lamps had gone out; a milk cart
3305,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"rattled across the square, and passed up a side street."
3306,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3307,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“One out of many, or only one?”"
3308,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3309,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"He put his cigarette out, he was beginning to breathe with difficulty,"
3310,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,he was beginning to shiver.
3311,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3312,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“Well——”
3313,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3314,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"He turned over, got up, stood on the floor."
3315,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3316,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“Is there nothing I can say?” he began, and went a little away and put"
3317,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,his things on.
3318,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3319,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“When shall I see you again?”
3320,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3321,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"And now a cold sweat broke out on him, and his chin trembled."
3322,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3323,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,“Tomorrow?”
3324,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3325,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"He tried to come toward her, but he found himself near the door instead."
3326,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3327,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“I’m nothing,” he said, and turned toward her, bent slightly; he wanted"
3328,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,to kiss her feet—but nothing helped him.
3329,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3330,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"“You’ve taken everything now, now I cannot feel, I do not suffer——” He"
3331,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,tried to look at her—and succeeded finally after a long time.
3332,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3333,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,He could see that she did not know he was in the room.
3334,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3335,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"Then something like horror entered him, and with a soft, swift running"
3336,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"gait he reached the door, turned the handle and was gone."
3337,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3338,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"A few days later, at dusk, for his heart was the heart of a dog, he came"
3339,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"into Katrina’s street, and looked at the house."
3340,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3341,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"A single length of crape, bowed, hung at the door."
3342,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3343,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"From that day he began to drink heavily, he got to be quite a nuisance"
3344,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"in the cafés, he seldom had money to pay, he was a fearless beggar,"
3345,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"almost insolent, and once when he saw Otto Silverstaff sitting alone in"
3346,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,"a corner, with his two children, he laughed a loud laugh and burst into"
3347,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,tears.
3348,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3349,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,
3350,KATRINA SILVERSTAFF,

3352,HUSH BEFORE LOVE,HUSH BEFORE LOVE
3353,HUSH BEFORE LOVE,
3354,HUSH BEFORE LOVE,
3355,HUSH BEFORE LOVE,"A voice rose in the darkness saying “Love,”"
3356,HUSH BEFORE LOVE,"And in the stall the scattered mice grew still,"
3357,HUSH BEFORE LOVE,"Where yet the white ox slept, and on the sill"
3358,HUSH BEFORE LOVE,"The crowing cock paused, and the grey house dove"
3359,HUSH BEFORE LOVE,Turned twice about upon the ledge above.

3364,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE
3365,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3366,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3367,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"In a stately decaying mansion, on the lower end of the Avenue, lived a"
3368,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,woman by the name of Nelly Grissard.
3369,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3370,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Two heavy cocks stood on either side of the brownstone steps, looking"
3371,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"out toward the park; and in the back garden a fountain, having poured"
3372,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"out its soul for many a year, still poured, murmuring over the stomachs"
3373,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,of the three cherubim supporting its massive basin.
3374,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3375,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Nelly Grissard was fat and lively to the point of excess. She never let
3376,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,a waxed floor pass under her without proving herself light of foot.
3377,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Every ounce of Nelly Grissard was on the jump. Her fingers tapped, her"
3378,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"feet fluttered, her bosom heaved; her entire diaphragm swelled with"
3379,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"little creakings of whale-bone, lace and taffeta."
3380,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3381,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"She wore feathery things about the throat, had a liking for deep"
3382,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"burgundy silks, and wore six petticoats for the “joy of discovering that"
3383,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,I’m not so fat as they say.” She stained her good square teeth with
3384,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"tobacco, and cut her hair in a bang."
3385,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3386,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Nelly Grissard was fond of saying: “I’m more French than human.” Her
3387,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,late husband had been French; had dragged his nationality about with him
3388,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,with the melancholy of a man who had half dropped his cloak and that
3389,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"cloak his life, and in the end, having wrapped it tightly about him, had"
3390,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,departed as a Frenchman should.
3391,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3392,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"There had been many “periods” in Nelly Grissard’s life, a Russian, a"
3393,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Greek, and those privileged to look through her key-hole said, even a"
3394,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Chinese.
3395,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3396,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"She believed in “intuition,” but it was always first-hand intuition; she"
3397,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,learned geography by a strict system of love affairs—never two men from
3398,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,the same part of the country.
3399,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3400,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,She also liked receiving “spirit messages”—they kept her in touch with
3401,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,international emotion—she kept many irons in the fire and not the least
3402,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,of them was the “spiritual” iron.
3403,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3404,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Then she had what she called a “healing touch”—she could take away
3405,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"headaches, and she could tell by one pass of her hand if the bump on"
3406,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,that particular head was a bump of genius or of avarice—or if (and she
3407,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"used to shudder, closing her eyes and withdrawing her hand with a slow,"
3408,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,poised and expectant manner) it was the bump of the senses.
3409,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3410,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Nelly was, in other words, dangerously careful of her sentimentalism. No"
3411,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,one but a sentimental woman would have called her great roomy mansion
3412,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“The Robin’s House,” no one but a sentimentalist could possibly have"
3413,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"lived through so many days and nights of saying “yes” breathlessly, or"
3414,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,could have risen so often from her bed with such a magnificent and
3415,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,knowing air.
3416,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3417,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,No one looking through the gratings of the basement window would have
3418,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,guessed at the fermenting mind of Nelly Grissard. Here well-starched
3419,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"domestics rustled about, laying cool fingers on cool fowls and frosted"
3420,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"bottles. The cook, it is true, was a little untidy; he would come and"
3421,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"stand in the entry, when Spring was approaching, and look over the head"
3422,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"of Nelly Grissard’s old nurse, who sat in a wheel-chair all day, her"
3423,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,feeble hands crossed over a discarded rug of the favourite burgundy
3424,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"colour, staring away with half-melted eyes into the everlasting"
3425,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"fountain, while below the cook’s steaming face, on a hairy chest, rose"
3426,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,and fell a faded holy amulet.
3427,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3428,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Sometimes the world paused to see Nelly Grissard pounce down the steps,"
3429,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"one after another, and with a final swift and high gesture take her"
3430,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"magnificent legs out for a drive, the coachman cracking his whip, the"
3431,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,braided ribbons dancing at the horses’ ears.
3432,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3433,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"And that was about all—no, if one cared to notice, a man, in the early"
3434,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"forties, who passed every afternoon just at four, swinging a heavy black"
3435,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,cane.
3436,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3437,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"This man was Nicholas Golwein—half Tartar, half Jew."
3438,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3439,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"There was something dark, evil and obscure about Nicholas Golwein, and"
3440,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"something bending, kindly, compassionate. Yet he was a very Jew by"
3441,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"nature. He rode little, danced less, but smoked great self-reassuring"
3442,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"cigars, and could out-ponder the average fidgety American by hours."
3443,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3444,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"He had travelled, he had lived as the “Romans lived,” and had sent many"
3445,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,a hot-eyed girl back across the fields with something to forget or
3446,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"remember, according to her nature."
3447,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3448,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,This man had been Nelly Grissard’s lover at the most depraved period of
3449,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Nelly’s life. At that moment when she was colouring her drinking water
3450,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"green, and living on ox liver and “testina en broda,” Nicholas Golwein"
3451,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"had turned her collar back, and kissed her on that intimate portion of"
3452,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"the throat where it has just left daylight, yet has barely passed into"
3453,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,the shadow of the breast.
3454,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3455,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"To be sure, Nelly Grissard had been depraved at an exceedingly early"
3456,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"age, if depravity is understood to be the ability to enjoy what others"
3457,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"shudder at, and to shudder at what others enjoy."
3458,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3459,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Nelly Grissard dreamed “absolutely honestly”—stress on the
3460,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"absolutely—when it was all the fashion to dream obscurely,—she could"
3461,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,sustain the conversation just long enough not to be annoyingly
3462,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"brilliant, she loved to talk of ancient crimes, drawing her stomach in,"
3463,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"and bending her fingers slightly, just slightly, but also just enough to"
3464,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,make the guests shiver a little and think how she really should have
3465,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,been born in the time of the Cenci. And during the craze for Gauguin she
3466,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,was careful to mention that she had passed over the same South Sea
3467,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"roads, but where Gauguin had walked, she had been carried by two"
3468,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,astonished donkeys.
3469,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3470,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,She had been “kind” to Nicholas Golwein just long enough to make the
3471,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,racial melancholy blossom into a rank tall weed. He loved beautiful
3472,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"things, and she possessed them. He had become used to her, had"
3473,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,“forgiven” her much (for those who had to forgive at all had to forgive
3474,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Nelly in a large way), and the fact that she was too fluid to need one"
3475,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"person’s forgiveness long, drove him into slow bitterness and despair."
3476,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3477,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"The fact that “her days were on her,” and that she did not feel the"
3478,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"usual woman’s fear of age and dissolution, nay, that she even saw new"
3479,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"measures to take, possessing a fertility that can only come of a"
3480,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"decaying mind, drove him almost into insanity."
3481,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3482,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"When the Autumn came, and the leaves were falling from the trees, as"
3483,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,nature grew hot and the last flames of the season licked high among the
3484,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"branches, Nicholas Golwein’s cheeks burned with a dull red, and he"
3485,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,turned his eyes down.
3486,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3487,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Life did not exist for Nicholas Golwein as a matter of day and after
3488,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"day—it was flung at him from time to time as a cloak is flung a flunkey,"
3489,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"and this made him proud, morose, silent."
3490,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3491,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Was it not somehow indecent that, after his forgiveness and"
3492,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"understanding, there should be the understanding and forgiveness of"
3493,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,another?
3494,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3495,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,There was undoubtedly something cruel about Nelly Grissard’s love; she
3496,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"took at random, and Nicholas Golwein had been the most random, perhaps,"
3497,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"of all. The others, before him, had all been of her own class—the first"
3498,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"had even married her, and when she finally drove him to the knife’s"
3499,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"edge, had left her a fair fortune. Nicholas Golwein had always earned"
3500,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"his own living, he was an artist and lived as artists live. Then Nelly"
3501,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"came—and went—and after him she had again taken one of her own kind, a"
3502,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"wealthy Norwegian—Nord, a friend of Nicholas’."
3503,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3504,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Sometimes now Nicholas Golwein would go off into the country, trying to"
3505,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"forget, trying to curb the tastes that Nelly’s love had nourished. He"
3506,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"nosed out small towns, but he always came hurriedly back, smelling of"
3507,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"sassafras, the dull penetrating odour of grass, contact with trees,"
3508,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,half-tamed animals.
3509,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3510,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,The country made him think of Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony—he would
3511,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,start running—running seemed a way to complete all that was sketchy and
3512,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"incomplete about nature, music, love."
3513,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3514,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,“Would I recognize God if I saw him?” The joy of thinking such thoughts
3515,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"was not every man’s, and this cheered him."
3516,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3517,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Sometimes he would go to see Nord; he was not above visiting Nelly’s
3518,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,lover—in fact there was that between them.
3519,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3520,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,He had fancied death lately. There was a tremendously sterile quality
3521,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"about Nicholas Golwein’s fancies; they were the fancies of a race, and"
3522,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,not of a man.
3523,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3524,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,He discussed death with Nord—before the end there is something pleasant
3525,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"in a talk of a means to an end, and Nord had the coldness that makes"
3526,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,death strong.
3527,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3528,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“I can hate,” he would say, watching Nord out of the corner of his eye;"
3529,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“Nelly can’t, she’s too provincial——”"
3530,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3531,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“Yes, there’s truth in that. Nelly’s good to herself—what more is"
3532,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,there?”
3533,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3534,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“There’s understanding.” He meant compassion, and his eyes filled. “Does"
3535,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,she ever speak of me?”
3536,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3537,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,It was beginning to rain. Large drops struck softly against the café
3538,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,window and thinning out ran down upon the sill.
3539,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3540,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“Oh, yes.”"
3541,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3542,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,“And she says?”
3543,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3544,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“Why are you never satisfied with what you have, Nicholas?”"
3545,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3546,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Nicholas Golwein turned red. “One dish of cream and the cat should lick
3547,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"his paws into eternity. I suppose one would learn how she felt, if she"
3548,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"feels at all, if one died.”"
3549,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3550,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“Why, yes, I suppose so.”"
3551,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3552,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"They looked at each other, Nicholas Golwein in a furtive manner, moving"
3553,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"his lips around his cigar—Nord absently, smiling a little. “Yes, that"
3554,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,would amuse her.”
3555,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3556,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,“What?” Nicholas Golwein paused in his smoking and let his hot eyes rest
3557,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,on Nord.
3558,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3559,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“Well, if you can manage it——”"
3560,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3561,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Nicholas Golwein made a gesture, shaking his cuff-links like a"
3562,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"harness—“I can manage it,” he said, wondering what Nord was thinking."
3563,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3564,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“Of course it’s rather disgusting,” Nord said."
3565,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3566,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“I know, I know I should go out like a gentleman, but there’s more in me"
3567,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"than the gentleman, there’s something that understands meanness; a Jew"
3568,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"can only love and be intimate with the thing that’s a little abnormal,"
3569,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"and so I love what’s low and treacherous and cunning, because there’s"
3570,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"nobility and uneasiness in it for me—well,” he flung out his arms—“if"
3571,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"you were to say to Nell, ‘He hung himself in the small hours, with a"
3572,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"sheet’—what then? Everything she had ever said to me, been to me, will"
3573,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,change for her—she won’t be able to read those French journals in the
3574,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"same way, she won’t be able to swallow water as she has always swallowed"
3575,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"it. I know, you’ll say there’s nature and do you know what I’ll answer:"
3576,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,that I have a contempt for animals—just because they do not have to
3577,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"include Nelly Grissard’s whims in their means to a living conduct—well,"
3578,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"listen, I’ve made up my mind to something”—he became calm all of a"
3579,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,sudden and looked Nord directly in the face.
3580,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3581,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,“Well?”
3582,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3583,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“I shall follow you up the stairs, stand behind the door, and you shall"
3584,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"say just these words, ‘Nicholas has hung himself.’”"
3585,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3586,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,“And then what?”
3587,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3588,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“That’s all, that’s quite sufficient—then I shall know everything.”"
3589,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3590,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Nord stood up, letting Nicholas open the café door for him."
3591,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3592,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,“You don’t object?” Nicholas Golwein murmured.
3593,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3594,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Nord laughed a cold, insulting laugh. “It will amuse her——”"
3595,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3596,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Nicholas nodded, “Yes, we’ve held the coarse essentials between our"
3597,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"teeth like good dogs—” he said, trying to be insulting in turn, but it"
3598,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"only sounded pathetic, sentimental."
3599,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3600,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,*       *       *       *       *
3601,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3602,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Without a word passing between them, on the following day, they went up"
3603,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"the stairs of Nelly Grissard’s house, together. The door into the inner"
3604,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"room was ajar, and Nicholas crept in behind this, seating himself on a"
3605,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,little table.
3606,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3607,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"He heard Nord greet Nelly, and Nelly’s voice answering—“Ah, dear”—he"
3608,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"listened no further for a moment, his mind went back, and he seemed to"
3609,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,himself to be peaceful and happy all at once. “A binding up of old
3610,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"sores,” he thought, a oneness with what was good and simple—with"
3611,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,everything that evil had not contorted.
3612,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3613,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“Religion,” he thought to himself, resting his chin on his"
3614,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"hands—thinking what religion had meant to all men at all times, but to"
3615,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,no man in his most need. “Religion is a design for pain—that’s it.” Then
3616,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"he thought, that, like all art, must be fundamentally against God—God"
3617,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"had made his own plans—well, of that later——"
3618,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3619,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Nelly had just said something—there had been a death-like silence, then"
3620,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"her cry, but he had forgotten to listen to what it was that had passed."
3621,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"He changed hands on his cane. “There is someone in heaven,” he found his"
3622,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,mind saying. The rising of this feeling was pleasant—it seemed to come
3623,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,from the very centre of his being. “There’s someone in heaven—who?” he
3624,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"asked himself, “who?” But there was no possible answer that was not"
3625,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,blasphemy.
3626,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3627,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,“Jews do not kill themselves——”
3628,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3629,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Nelly’s voice. He smiled—there was someone in heaven, but no one here."
3630,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“I’m coming,” he murmured to himself—and felt a sensuous giving away in"
3631,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,the promise.
3632,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3633,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,His eyes filled. What was good in death had been used up long ago—now it
3634,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,was only dull repetition—death had gone beyond the need of death.
3635,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3636,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Funnily enough he thought of Nelly as she was that evening when she had
3637,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,something to forgive. He had pulled her toward him by one end of a
3638,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"burgundy ribbon, “Forgive, forgive,” and she had been kind enough not to"
3639,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"raise him, not to kiss him, saying, “I forgive”—she just stood there"
3640,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"showing her tobacco-stained teeth in a strong laugh, “Judas eliminated.”"
3641,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"He put his hand to his mouth, “I have been _There_,” and _There_ seemed"
3642,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"like a place where no one had ever been. How cruel, how monstrous!"
3643,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3644,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Someone was running around the room, heavy, ponderous. “She always"
3645,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"prided herself on her lightness of foot,” and here she was running like"
3646,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"a trapped animal, making little cries, “By the neck!”—strange words,"
3647,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,horrifying—unreal——
3648,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3649,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“To be a little meaner than the others, a little more crafty”—well, he"
3650,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"had accomplished that, too."
3651,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3652,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Someone must be leaning on the couch, it groaned. That took him back to"
3653,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Boulogne; he had loved a girl once in Boulogne, and once in the dark"
3654,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"they had fallen, it was like falling through the sky, through the stars,"
3655,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"finding that the stars were not only one layer thick, but that there"
3656,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"were many layers, millions of layers, a thickness to them, and a"
3657,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"depth—then the floor—that was like a final promise of something sordid,"
3658,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,but lasting—firm.
3659,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3660,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Sounds rose from the streets; automobiles going uptown, horses’ hoofs, a"
3661,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"cycle siren,—that must be a child,—long drawn out, and piercing—yes,"
3662,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,only a child would hold on to a sound like that.
3663,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3664,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“Life is life,” Nelly had just said, firmly, decisively. After all he"
3665,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"had done this well—he had never been able to think of death long, but"
3666,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"now he had thought of it, made it pretty real—he remembered sparrows,"
3667,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"for some unknown reason, and this worried him."
3668,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3669,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“The line of the hips, simply Renoir over again——”"
3670,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3671,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,They were on the familiar subject of art.
3672,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3673,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"The sounds in the room twittered about him like wings in a close garden,"
3674,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"where there is neither night nor day. “There is a power in death, even"
3675,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"the thought of death, that is very terrible and very beautiful——” His"
3676,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"cane slipped, and struck the floor."
3677,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3678,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“What was that?” the voice of Nelly Grissard was high, excited,"
3679,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,startled——
3680,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3681,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,“A joke.”
3682,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3683,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Nicholas Golwein suddenly walked into the room.
3684,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3685,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“A joke,” he said and looked at them both, smiling."
3686,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3687,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Nelly Grissard, who was on her knees, and who was holding Nord’s shoe in"
3688,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"one hand, stared at him. It seemed that she must have been about to kiss"
3689,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,Nord’s foot.
3690,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3691,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Nicholas Golwein bowed, a magnificent bow, and was about to go."
3692,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3693,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” Nelly Grissard cried, angrily,"
3694,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,and got to her feet.
3695,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3696,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,He began to stammer: “I—I am leaving town—I wanted to pay my respects——”
3697,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3698,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"“Well, go along with you——”"
3699,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,
3700,THE ROBIN’S HOUSE,"Nicholas Golwein went out, shutting the door carefully behind him."

3718,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3719,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3720,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Pauvla Agrippa had died that afternoon at three; now she lay with quiet
3721,NO-MAN’S-MARE,hands crossed a little below her fine breast with its transparent skin
3722,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"showing the veins as filmy as old lace, purple veins that were now only"
3723,NO-MAN’S-MARE,a system of charts indicating the pathways where her life once flowed.
3724,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3725,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Her small features were angular with that repose which she had often
3726,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"desired. She had not wanted to live, because she did not mind death."
3727,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"There were no candles about her where she lay, nor any flowers. She had"
3728,NO-MAN’S-MARE,said quite logically to her sisters: “Are there any candles and flowers
3729,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"at a birth?” They saw the point, but regretted the philosophy, for"
3730,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"buying flowers would have connected them with Pauvla Agrippa, in this,"
3731,NO-MAN’S-MARE,her new adventure.
3732,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3733,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Pauvla Agrippa’s hair lay against her cheeks like pats of plated butter;
3734,NO-MAN’S-MARE,the long golden ends tucked in and wound about her head and curved
3735,NO-MAN’S-MARE,behind her neck. Pauvla Agrippa had once been complimented on her fine
3736,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"black eyes and this yellow hair of hers, and she had smiled and been"
3737,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"quite pleased, but had drawn attention to the fact that she had also"
3738,NO-MAN’S-MARE,another quite remarkable set of differences—her small thin arms with
3739,NO-MAN’S-MARE,their tiny hands and her rather long narrow feet.
3740,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3741,NO-MAN’S-MARE,She said that she was built to remain standing; now she could rest.
3742,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3743,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Her sister, Tasha, had been going about all day, praying to different"
3744,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"objects in search of one that would give her comfort, though she was not"
3745,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"so much grieved as she might have been, because Pauvla Agrippa had been"
3746,NO-MAN’S-MARE,so curious about all this.
3747,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3748,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"True, Agrippa’s husband seemed lost, and wandered about like a restless"
3749,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"dog, trying to find a spot that would give him relief as he smoked."
3750,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3751,NO-MAN’S-MARE,One of Pauvla’s brothers was playing on the floor with Pauvla’s baby.
3752,NO-MAN’S-MARE,This baby was small and fat and full of curves. His arms curved above
3753,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"his head, and his legs curved downward, including his picture book and"
3754,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"rattle in their oval. He shouted from time to time at his uncle, biting"
3755,NO-MAN’S-MARE,the buttons on his uncle’s jacket. This baby and this boy had one thing
3756,NO-MAN’S-MARE,in common—a deep curiosity—a sense that somewhere that curiosity would
3757,NO-MAN’S-MARE,be satisfied. They had all accomplished something. Pauvla Agrippa and
3758,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"her husband and her sister and the boy and Pauvla’s baby, but still"
3759,NO-MAN’S-MARE,there was incompleteness about everything.
3760,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3761,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Nothing was ever done; there wasn’t such a thing as rest, that was"
3762,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"certain, for the sister still felt that her prayers were not definite,"
3763,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"the husband knew he would smoke again after lunch, the boy knew he was"
3764,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"only beginning something, as the baby also felt it, and Pauvla Agrippa"
3765,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"herself, the seemingly most complete, had yet to be buried. Her body was"
3766,NO-MAN’S-MARE,confronted with the eternal necessity of change.
3767,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3768,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"It was all very sad and puzzling, and rather nice too. After all, atoms"
3769,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"were the only things that had imperishable existence, and therefore were"
3770,NO-MAN’S-MARE,the omnipotent quality and quantity—God should be recognized as
3771,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"something that was everywhere in millions, irrevocable and"
3772,NO-MAN’S-MARE,ineradicable—one single great thing has always been the prey of the
3773,NO-MAN’S-MARE,million little things. The beasts of the jungle are laid low by the
3774,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"insects. Yes, she agreed that everything was multiple that counted."
3775,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Pauvla was multiple now, and some day they would be also. This was the"
3776,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"reason that she wandered from room to room touching things, vases,"
3777,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"candlesticks, tumblers, knives, forks, the holy pictures and statues and"
3778,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"praying to each of them, praying for a great thing, to many presences."
3779,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3780,NO-MAN’S-MARE,A neighbour from across the way came to see them while Pauvla’s brother
3781,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"was still playing with the baby. This man was a farmer, once upon a"
3782,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"time, and liked to remember it, as city-bred men in the country like to"
3783,NO-MAN’S-MARE,remember New York and its sophistication.
3784,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3785,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"He spent his Summers, however, in the little fishing village where the"
3786,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"sisters, Pauvla and Tasha, had come to know him. He always spoke of"
3787,NO-MAN’S-MARE,“going toward the sea.” He said that there was something more than wild
3788,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"about the ocean; it struck him as being a little unnatural, too."
3789,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3790,NO-MAN’S-MARE,He came in now grumbling and wiping his face with a coarse red
3791,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"handkerchief, remarking on the “catch” and upon the sorrow of the house"
3792,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"of Agrippa, all in the one breath."
3793,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3794,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"“There’s a touch of damp in the air,” he said, sniffing, his nose held"
3795,NO-MAN’S-MARE,back so that his small eyes gleamed directly behind it. “The fish have
3796,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"been bad catching and no-man’s-mare is going up the headlands, her tail"
3797,NO-MAN’S-MARE,stretched straight out.”
3798,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3799,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Tasha came forward with cakes and tea and paused, praying over them"
3800,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"also, still looking for comfort. She was a small woman, with a round,"
3801,NO-MAN’S-MARE,wrinkled forehead and the dark eyes of her sister; today she felt
3802,NO-MAN’S-MARE,inconvenienced because she could not understand her own feelings—once or
3803,NO-MAN’S-MARE,twice she had looked upon the corpse with resentment because it had done
3804,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"something to Pauvla; however, she was glad to see the old man, and she"
3805,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"prayed to him silently also, to see if it would help. Just what she"
3806,NO-MAN’S-MARE,prayed for she could not tell; the words she used were simple: “What is
3807,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"it, what is it?” over and over with her own childhood prayers to end"
3808,NO-MAN’S-MARE,with.
3809,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3810,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"She had a great deal of the quietness of this village about her, the"
3811,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"quietness that is in the roaring of the sea and the wind, and when she"
3812,NO-MAN’S-MARE,sighed it was like the sound made of great waters running back to sea
3813,NO-MAN’S-MARE,between the narrow sides of little stones.
3814,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3815,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"It was here that she, as well as her brothers and sisters, had been"
3816,NO-MAN’S-MARE,born. They fished in the fishing season and sold to the market at
3817,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"one-eighth of the market price, but when the markets went so low that"
3818,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"selling would put the profits down for months, they turned the nets over"
3819,NO-MAN’S-MARE,and sent the fish back to sea.
3820,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3821,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Today Tasha was dressed in her ball-gown; she had been anticipating a
3822,NO-MAN’S-MARE,local gathering that evening and then Pauvla Agrippa got her heart
3823,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"attack and died. This dress was low about the shoulders, with flounces"
3824,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"of taffeta, and the sea-beaten face of Tasha rose out of its stiff"
3825,NO-MAN’S-MARE,elegance like a rock from heavy moss. Now that she had brought the cakes
3826,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"and tea, she sat listening to this neighbour as he spoke French to her"
3827,NO-MAN’S-MARE,younger brother.
3828,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3829,NO-MAN’S-MARE,When they spoke in this strange language she was always surprised to
3830,NO-MAN’S-MARE,note that their voices became unfamiliar to her—she could not have told
3831,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"which was which, or if they were themselves at all. Closing her eyes,"
3832,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"she tried to see if this would make any difference, and it didn’t. Then"
3833,NO-MAN’S-MARE,she slowly raised her small plump hands and pressed them to her
3834,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"ears—this was better, because now she could not tell that it was French"
3835,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"that they were speaking, it was sound only and might have been anything,"
3836,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"and again she sighed, and was glad that they were less strange to her;"
3837,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"she could not bear this strangeness today, and wished they would stop"
3838,NO-MAN’S-MARE,speaking in a foreign tongue.
3839,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3840,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"“What are you saying?” she enquired, taking the teacup in one hand,"
3841,NO-MAN’S-MARE,keeping the other over her ear.
3842,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3843,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"“Talking about the horse,” he said, and went on."
3844,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3845,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Again Tasha became thoughtful. This horse that they were speaking about
3846,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"had been on the sands, it seemed to her, for as long as she could"
3847,NO-MAN’S-MARE,remember. It was a wild thing belonging to nobody. Sometimes in a coming
3848,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"storm, she had seen it standing with its head out toward the waters, its"
3849,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"mane flying in the light air, and its thin sides fluttering with the"
3850,NO-MAN’S-MARE,beating of its heart.
3851,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3852,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"It was old now, with sunken flanks and knuckled legs; it no longer stood"
3853,NO-MAN’S-MARE,straight—and the hair about its nose had begun to turn grey. It never
3854,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"interfered with the beach activities, and on the other hand it never"
3855,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"permitted itself to be touched. Early in her memory of this animal,"
3856,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Tasha had tried to stroke it, but it had started, arched its neck and"
3857,NO-MAN’S-MARE,backed away from her with hurried jumping steps. Many of the ignorant
3858,NO-MAN’S-MARE,fisherfolk had called it the sea horse and also “no-man’s-mare.” They
3859,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"began to fear it, and several of them thought it a bad omen."
3860,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3861,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Tasha knew better—sometimes it would be down upon the pebbly part of the
3862,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"shore, its head laid flat as though it were dead, but no one could"
3863,NO-MAN’S-MARE,approach within fifty feet without its instantly leaping up and standing
3864,NO-MAN’S-MARE,with its neck thrust forward and its brown eyes watching from beneath
3865,NO-MAN’S-MARE,the coarse lashes.
3866,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3867,NO-MAN’S-MARE,In the beginning people had tried to catch it and make it of use.
3868,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Gradually everyone in the village had made the attempt; not one of them
3869,NO-MAN’S-MARE,had ever succeeded.
3870,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3871,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"The large black nostrils were always wet, and they shook as though"
3872,NO-MAN’S-MARE,someone were blowing through them—great nostrils like black flowers.
3873,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3874,NO-MAN’S-MARE,This mare was old now and did not get up so often when approached. Tasha
3875,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"had been as near to it as ten paces, and Pauvla Agrippa had once"
3876,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"approached so near that she could see that its eyes were failing, that a"
3877,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"thin mist lay over its right eyeball, so that it seemed to be flirting"
3878,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"with her, and this made her sad and she hurried away, and she thought,"
3879,NO-MAN’S-MARE,“The horse had its own defence; when it dies it will be so horrifying
3880,NO-MAN’S-MARE,perhaps that not one of us will approach it.” Though many had squabbled
3881,NO-MAN’S-MARE,about which of them should have its long beautiful tail.
3882,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3883,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Pauvla Agrippa’s husband had finished his cigar and came in now, bending"
3884,NO-MAN’S-MARE,his head to get through the low casement. He spoke to the neighbour a
3885,NO-MAN’S-MARE,few moments and then sat down beside his sister-in-law.
3886,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3887,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"He began to tell her that something would have to be done with Pauvla,"
3888,NO-MAN’S-MARE,and added that they would have to manage to get her over to the
3889,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"undertaker’s at the end of the headland, but that they had no means of"
3890,NO-MAN’S-MARE,conveyance. Tasha thought of this horse because she had been thinking
3891,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"about it before he interrupted and she spoke of it timidly, but it was"
3892,NO-MAN’S-MARE,only an excuse to say something.
3893,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3894,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"“You can’t catch it,” he said, shaking his head."
3895,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3896,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Here the neighbour broke in: “It’s easy enough to catch it; this last
3897,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"week three children have stroked it—it’s pretty low, I guess; but I"
3898,NO-MAN’S-MARE,doubt if it would be able to walk that far.”
3899,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3900,NO-MAN’S-MARE,He looked over the rim of the teacup to see how this remark would be
3901,NO-MAN’S-MARE,taken—he felt excited all of a sudden at the thought that something was
3902,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"going to be attempted that had not been attempted in many years, and a"
3903,NO-MAN’S-MARE,feeling of misfortune took hold of him that he had certainly not felt at
3904,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Pauvla Agrippa’s death. Everything about the place, and his life that"
3905,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"had seemed to him quite normal and natural, now seemed strange."
3906,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3907,NO-MAN’S-MARE,The disrupting of one idea—that the horse could not be caught—put him
3908,NO-MAN’S-MARE,into a mood that made all other accustomed things alien.
3909,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3910,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"However, after this it seemed quite natural that they should make the"
3911,NO-MAN’S-MARE,effort and Tasha went into the room where Pauvla Agrippa lay.
3912,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3913,NO-MAN’S-MARE,The boy had fallen asleep in the corner and Pauvla’s baby was crawling
3914,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"over him, making for Pauvla, cooing softly and saying “mamma” with"
3915,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"difficulty, because the little under-lip kept reaching to the upper lip"
3916,NO-MAN’S-MARE,to prevent the saliva from interrupting the call.
3917,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3918,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Tasha put her foot in the baby’s way and stood looking down at Pauvla
3919,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Agrippa, where her small hands lay beneath her fine breast with its"
3920,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"purple veins, and now Tasha did not feel quite the same resentment that"
3921,NO-MAN’S-MARE,she had felt earlier. It is true this body had done something
3922,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"irrevocable to Pauvla Agrippa, but she also realized that she, Tasha,"
3923,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"must now do something to this body; it was the same with everything,"
3924,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"nothing was left as it was, something was always altering something"
3925,NO-MAN’S-MARE,else. Perhaps it was an unrecognized law.
3926,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3927,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Pauvla Agrippa’s husband had gone out to see what could be done with the
3928,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"mare, and now the neighbour came in, saying that it would not come in"
3929,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"over the sand, but that he—the husband—thought that it would walk toward"
3930,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"the headland, as it was wont."
3931,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3932,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"“If you could only carry her out to it,” he said."
3933,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3934,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Tasha called in two of her brothers and woke up the one on the floor.
3935,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"“Everything will be arranged for her comfort,” she said, “when we get"
3936,NO-MAN’S-MARE,her up there.” They lifted Pauvla Agrippa up and her baby began to
3937,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"laugh, asking to be lifted up also, and holding its little hands high"
3938,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"that it might be lifted, but no one was paying any attention to him,"
3939,NO-MAN’S-MARE,because now they were moving his mother.
3940,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3941,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Pauvla Agrippa looked fine as they carried her, only her small hands"
3942,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"parted and deserted the clef where they had lain, dropping down upon the"
3943,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"shoulders of her brothers. Several children stood hand in hand watching,"
3944,NO-MAN’S-MARE,and one or two villagers appeared who had heard from the neighbours what
3945,NO-MAN’S-MARE,was going on.
3946,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3947,NO-MAN’S-MARE,The mare had been induced to stand and someone had slipped a halter over
3948,NO-MAN’S-MARE,its neck for the first time in many years; there was a frightened look
3949,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"in the one eye and the film that covered the other seemed to darken, but"
3950,NO-MAN’S-MARE,it made no objection when they raised Pauvla Agrippa and placed her on
3951,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"its back, tying her on with a fish net."
3952,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3953,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Then someone laughed, and the neighbour slapped his leg saying, “Look"
3954,NO-MAN’S-MARE,what the old horse has come to—caught and burdened at last.” And he
3955,NO-MAN’S-MARE,watched the mare with small cruel eyes.
3956,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3957,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Pauvla Agrippa’s husband took the strap of the halter and began plodding
3958,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"through the sand, the two boys on either side of the horse holding to"
3959,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"all that was left of Pauvla Agrippa. Tasha came behind, her hands"
3960,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"folded, praying now to this horse, still trying to find peace, but she"
3961,NO-MAN’S-MARE,noticed with a little apprehension that the horse’s flanks had begun to
3962,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"quiver, and that this quiver was extending to its ribs and from its ribs"
3963,NO-MAN’S-MARE,to its forelegs.
3964,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3965,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Then she saw it turn a little, lifting its head. She called out to"
3966,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Pauvla Agrippa’s husband who, startled with the movement and the cry,"
3967,NO-MAN’S-MARE,dropped the rope.
3968,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3969,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"The mare had turned toward the sea; for an instant it stood there,"
3970,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"quivering, a great thin, bony thing with crooked legs; its blind eyes"
3971,NO-MAN’S-MARE,half covered with the black coarse lashes. Pauvla Agrippa with her head
3972,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"thrown a bit back rested easily, it seemed, the plaits of her yellow"
3973,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"hair lying about her neck, but away from her face, because she was not"
3974,NO-MAN’S-MARE,supported quite right; still she looked like some strange new sea animal
3975,NO-MAN’S-MARE,beneath the net that held her from falling.
3976,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3977,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"Then without warning, no-man’s-mare jumped forward and plunged neck-deep"
3978,NO-MAN’S-MARE,into the water.
3979,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3980,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"A great wave came up, covered it, receded and it could be seen swimming,"
3981,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"its head out of the water, while Pauvla Agrippa’s loosened yellow hair"
3982,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"floated behind. No one moved. Another wave rose high, descended, and"
3983,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"again the horse was seen swimming with head up, and this time Pauvla"
3984,NO-MAN’S-MARE,Agrippa’s hands were parted and lay along the water as though she were
3985,NO-MAN’S-MARE,swimming.
3986,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3987,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"The most superstitious among them began crossing themselves, and one"
3988,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"woman dropped on her knees, rocking from side to side; and still no one"
3989,NO-MAN’S-MARE,moved.
3990,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3991,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"And this time the wave rose, broke and passed on, leaving the surface"
3992,NO-MAN’S-MARE,smooth.
3993,NO-MAN’S-MARE,
3994,NO-MAN’S-MARE,That night Tasha picked up Pauvla Agrippa’s sleepy boy and standing in
3995,NO-MAN’S-MARE,"the doorway prayed to the sea, and this time she found comfort."

4602,MOTHER,"find themselves in pawn, and she moved among the trays like the"
4603,MOTHER,"guardians of cemetery grounds, who carry about with them some of the"
4604,MOTHER,lugubrious stillness of the earth on which they have been standing.
4605,MOTHER,
4606,MOTHER,"She dealt, in most part, in cameos, garnets, and a great many inlaid"
4607,MOTHER,"bracelets and cuff-links. There were a few watches however, and silver"
4608,MOTHER,"vessels and fishing tackle and faded slippers—and when, at night, she"
4609,MOTHER,"lit the lamp, these and the trays of precious and semi-precious stones,"
4610,MOTHER,"and the little ivory crucifixes, one on either side of the window,"
4611,MOTHER,"seemed to be leading a swift furtive life of their own, conscious of the"
4612,MOTHER,slow pacing woman who was known to the street as Lydia Passova.
4613,MOTHER,
4614,MOTHER,"No one knew her, not even her lover—a little nervous fellow, an"
4615,MOTHER,"Englishman quick in speech with a marked accent, a round-faced youth"
4616,MOTHER,"with a deep soft cleft in his chin, on which grew two separate tufts of"
4617,MOTHER,"yellow hair. His eyes were wide and pale, and his eyeteeth prominent."
4618,MOTHER,
4619,MOTHER,"He dressed in tweeds, walked with the toes in, seemed sorrowful when not"
4620,MOTHER,"talking, laughed a great deal and was nearly always to be found in the"
4621,MOTHER,café about four of an afternoon.
4622,MOTHER,
4623,MOTHER,When he spoke it was quick and jerky. He had spent a great deal of his
4624,MOTHER,"time in Europe, especially the watering places—and had managed to get"
4625,MOTHER,"himself in trouble in St. Moritz, it was said, with a well-connected"
4626,MOTHER,family.
4627,MOTHER,
4628,MOTHER,He liked to seem a little eccentric and managed it simply enough while
4629,MOTHER,"in America. He wore no hat, and liked to be found reading the _London"
4630,MOTHER,"Times_, under a park lamp at three in the morning."
4631,MOTHER,
4632,MOTHER,"Lydia Passova was never seen with him. She seldom left her shop,"
4633,MOTHER,"however, she was always pleased when he wanted to go anywhere: “Go,” she"
4634,MOTHER,"would say, kissing his hand, “and when you are tired come back.”"
4635,MOTHER,
4636,MOTHER,Sometimes she would make him cry. Turning around she would look at him a
4637,MOTHER,"little surprised, with lowered lids, and a light tightening of the"
4638,MOTHER,mouth.
4639,MOTHER,
4640,MOTHER,"“Yes,” he would say, “I know I’m trivial—well then, here I go, I will"
4641,MOTHER,"leave you, not disturb you any longer!” and darting for the door he"
4642,MOTHER,would somehow end by weeping with his head buried in her lap.
4643,MOTHER,
4644,MOTHER,"She would say, “There, there—why are you so nervous?”"
4645,MOTHER,
4646,MOTHER,"And he would laugh again: “My father was a nervous man, and my mother"
4647,MOTHER,"was high-strung, and as for me——” He would not finish."
4648,MOTHER,
4649,MOTHER,"Sometimes he would talk to her for long hours, she seldom answering,"
4650,MOTHER,"occupied with her magnifying glass and her rings, but in the end she was"
4651,MOTHER,"sure to send him out with: “That’s all very true, I have no doubt; now"
4652,MOTHER,"go out by yourself and think it over”—and he would go, with something"
4653,MOTHER,"like relief, embracing her large hips with his small strong arms."
4654,MOTHER,
4655,MOTHER,"They had known each other a very short time, three or four months. He"
4656,MOTHER,"had gone in to pawn his little gold ring, he was always in financial"
4657,MOTHER,"straits, though his mother sent him five pounds a week; and examining"
4658,MOTHER,"the ring, Lydia Passova had been so quiet, inevitable, necessary, that"
4659,MOTHER,"it seemed as if he must have known her forever—“at some time,” as he"
4660,MOTHER,said.
4661,MOTHER,
4662,MOTHER,"Yet they had never grown together. They remained detached, and on her"
4663,MOTHER,"part, quiet, preoccupied."
4664,MOTHER,
4665,MOTHER,He never knew how much she liked him. She never told him; if he asked
4666,MOTHER,"she would look at him in that surprised manner, drawing her mouth"
4667,MOTHER,together.
4668,MOTHER,
4669,MOTHER,"In the beginning he had asked her a great many times, clinging to her,"
4670,MOTHER,"and she moved about arranging her trays with a slight smile, and in the"
4671,MOTHER,end lowered her hand and stroked him gently.
4672,MOTHER,
4673,MOTHER,"He immediately became excited. “Let us dance,” he cried, “I have a great"
4674,MOTHER,capacity for happiness.”
4675,MOTHER,
4676,MOTHER,"“Yes, you are very happy,” she said."
4677,MOTHER,
4678,MOTHER,"“You understand, don’t you?” he asked abruptly."
4679,MOTHER,
4680,MOTHER,“What?”
4681,MOTHER,
4682,MOTHER,"“That my tears are nothing, have no significance, they are just a"
4683,MOTHER,protective fluid—when I see anything happening that is about to affect
4684,MOTHER,"my happiness I cry, that’s all.”"
4685,MOTHER,
4686,MOTHER,"“Yes,” Lydia Passova said, “I understand.” She turned around reaching up"
4687,MOTHER,"to some shelves, and over her shoulder she asked, “Does it hurt?”"
4688,MOTHER,
4689,MOTHER,"“No, it only frightens me. You never cry, do you?”"
4690,MOTHER,
4691,MOTHER,"“No, I never cry.”"
4692,MOTHER,
4693,MOTHER,"That was all. He never knew where she had come from, what her life had"
4694,MOTHER,"been, if she had or had not been married, if she had or had not known"
4695,MOTHER,"lovers; all that she would say was, “Well, you are with me, does that"
4696,MOTHER,"tell you nothing?” and he had to answer, “No, it tells me nothing.”"
4697,MOTHER,
4698,MOTHER,"When he was sitting in the café he often thought to himself, “There’s a"
4699,MOTHER,great woman”—and he was a little puzzled why he thought this because his
4700,MOTHER,need of her was so entirely different from any need he seemed to
4701,MOTHER,remember having possessed before.
4702,MOTHER,
4703,MOTHER,"There was no swagger in him about her, the swagger he had always felt"
4704,MOTHER,for his conquests with women. Yet there was not a trace of shame—he was
4705,MOTHER,"neither proud nor shy about Lydia Passova, he was something entirely"
4706,MOTHER,different. He could not have said himself what his feeling was—but it
4707,MOTHER,was in no way disturbing.
4708,MOTHER,
4709,MOTHER,"People had, it is true, begun to tease him:"
4710,MOTHER,
4711,MOTHER,“You’re a devil with the ladies.”
4712,MOTHER,
4713,MOTHER,"Where this had made him proud, now it made him uneasy."
4714,MOTHER,
4715,MOTHER,"“Now, there’s a certain Lydia Passova for instance, who would ever have"
4716,MOTHER,thought——”
4717,MOTHER,
4718,MOTHER,Furious he would rise.
4719,MOTHER,
4720,MOTHER,"“So, you do feel——”"
4721,MOTHER,
4722,MOTHER,"He would walk away, stumbling a little among the chairs, putting his"
4723,MOTHER,hand on the back of every one on the way to the door.
4724,MOTHER,
4725,MOTHER,"Yet he could see that, in her time, Lydia Passova had been a “perverse”"
4726,MOTHER,"woman—there was, about everything she did, an economy that must once"
4727,MOTHER,"have been a very sensitive and a very sensuous impatience, and because"
4728,MOTHER,of this everyone who saw her felt a personal loss.
4729,MOTHER,
4730,MOTHER,"Sometimes, tormented, he would come running to her, stopping abruptly,"
4731,MOTHER,putting it to her this way:
4732,MOTHER,
4733,MOTHER,“Somebody has said something to me.”
4734,MOTHER,
4735,MOTHER,“When—where?”
4736,MOTHER,
4737,MOTHER,"“Now, in the café.”"
4738,MOTHER,
4739,MOTHER,“What?”
4740,MOTHER,
4741,MOTHER,"“I don’t know, a reproach——”"
4742,MOTHER,
4743,MOTHER,She would say:
4744,MOTHER,
4745,MOTHER,"“We are all, unfortunately, only what we are.”"
4746,MOTHER,
4747,MOTHER,"She had a large and beautiful angora cat, it used to sit in the tray of"
4748,MOTHER,amethysts and opals and stare at her from very bright cold eyes. One day
4749,MOTHER,"it died, and calling her lover to her she said:"
4750,MOTHER,
4751,MOTHER,"“Take her out and bury her.” And when he had buried her he came back,"
4752,MOTHER,his lips twitching.
4753,MOTHER,
4754,MOTHER,“You loved that cat—this will be a great loss.”
4755,MOTHER,
4756,MOTHER,“Have I a memory?” she inquired.
4757,MOTHER,
4758,MOTHER,"“Yes,” he answered."
4759,MOTHER,
4760,MOTHER,"“Well,” she said quietly, fixing her magnifying glass firmly in her eye."
4761,MOTHER,"“We have looked at each other, that is enough.”"
4762,MOTHER,
4763,MOTHER,And then one day she died.
4764,MOTHER,
4765,MOTHER,"The caretaker of the furnace came to him, where he was sipping his"
4766,MOTHER,"liqueur as he talked to his cousin, a pretty little blond girl, who had"
4767,MOTHER,"a boring and comfortably provincial life, and who was beginning to"
4768,MOTHER,chafe.
4769,MOTHER,
4770,MOTHER,"He got up, trembling, pale, and hurried out."
4771,MOTHER,
4772,MOTHER,"The police were there, and said they thought it had been heart failure."
4773,MOTHER,
4774,MOTHER,"She lay on the couch in the inner room. She was fully dressed, even to"
4775,MOTHER,her coral ornaments; her shoes were neatly tied—large bows of a ribbed
4776,MOTHER,silk.
4777,MOTHER,
4778,MOTHER,"He looked down. Her small eyes were slightly open, the left, that had"
4779,MOTHER,"used the magnifying glass, was slightly wider than the other. For a"
4780,MOTHER,minute she seemed quite natural. She had the look of one who is about to
4781,MOTHER,say: “Sit beside me.”
4782,MOTHER,
4783,MOTHER,Then he felt the change. It was in the peculiar heaviness of the
4784,MOTHER,head—sensed through despair and not touch. The high breasts looked very
4785,MOTHER,"still, the hands were half closed, a little helpless, as in life—hands"
4786,MOTHER,that were too proud to “hold.” The drawn-up limb exposed a black
4787,MOTHER,"petticoat and a yellow stocking. It seemed that she had become hard—set,"
4788,MOTHER,"as in a mould—that she rejected everything now, but in rejecting had"
4789,MOTHER,bruised him with a last terrible pressure. He moved and knelt down. He
4790,MOTHER,shivered. He put his closed hands to his eyes. He could not weep.
4791,MOTHER,
4792,MOTHER,"She was an old woman, he could see that. The ceasing of that one thing"
4793,MOTHER,that she could still have for anyone made it simple and direct.
4794,MOTHER,
4795,MOTHER,"Something oppressed him, weighed him down, bent his shoulders, closed"
4796,MOTHER,his throat. He felt as one feels who has become conscious of passion for
4797,MOTHER,"the first time, in the presence of a relative."
4798,MOTHER,
4799,MOTHER,"He flung himself on his face, like a child."
4800,MOTHER,
4801,MOTHER,"That night, however, he wept, lying in bed, his knees drawn up."

4826,THE NIGGER,THE NIGGER
4827,THE NIGGER,
4828,THE NIGGER,
4829,THE NIGGER,"John Hardaway was dying. That wasn’t what he minded. His small,"
4830,THE NIGGER,well-shaped hands twitched at the soft coverlet which rose and fell
4831,THE NIGGER,"slowly with his breathing, and he breathed hard with mouth open, showing"
4832,THE NIGGER,all his teeth.
4833,THE NIGGER,
4834,THE NIGGER,"Rabb, the nigger, crouched in the corner. The air about her was heavy"
4835,THE NIGGER,with her odour. She kept blinking her eyes. She was awed at the presence
4836,THE NIGGER,"of her master, but ashamed too, ashamed that he was dying—ashamed as she"
4837,THE NIGGER,would have been had he been caught at his toilet.
4838,THE NIGGER,
4839,THE NIGGER,"Rabb was a good nigger; she had served John Hardaway’s mother, she had"
4840,THE NIGGER,seen her die—old Mrs. Hardaway fluttered against her lace like a bird
4841,THE NIGGER,caught in deep foliage—Rabb had been able to do something about Mrs.
4842,THE NIGGER,"Hardaway’s death because Mrs. Hardaway had loved her, in her way."
4843,THE NIGGER,
4844,THE NIGGER,"Mrs. Hardaway had died understandably—she had breathed hard too, opening"
4845,THE NIGGER,"her mouth, but it was gentle and eager, like a child at the breast."
4846,THE NIGGER,
4847,THE NIGGER,"Rabb had tried to be near her, had put her hands on her. But the thing"
4848,THE NIGGER,"she was trying to touch lay in some hidden corner of Mrs. Hardaway, as a"
4849,THE NIGGER,"cat hides away under a bed, and Rabb had done nothing after all."
4850,THE NIGGER,
4851,THE NIGGER,But it was different with John Hardaway. She watched life playing
4852,THE NIGGER,coquettishly with him. It played with him as a dog plays with an old
4853,THE NIGGER,coat. It shook him suddenly in great gusts of merriment. It played with
4854,THE NIGGER,"his eyelids; it twisted his mouth, it went in and out of his body, like"
4855,THE NIGGER,"a flame running through a funnel—throwing him utterly aside in the end,"
4856,THE NIGGER,"leaving him cold, lonely, and forbidding."
4857,THE NIGGER,
4858,THE NIGGER,John Hardaway hated negroes with that hate a master calls love. He was a
4859,THE NIGGER,Southerner and never forgot it. Rabb had nursed him when he was an
4860,THE NIGGER,"infant, she had seen him grow up into a big boy, and then she had been"
4861,THE NIGGER,there when he broke his mistress’s back by some flaw in his otherwise
4862,THE NIGGER,flawless passion.
4863,THE NIGGER,
4864,THE NIGGER,From time to time John Hardaway called for water. And when Rabb tried to
4865,THE NIGGER,"lift his head, he cursed her for a ‘black bitch’—but in the end he had"
4866,THE NIGGER,to let her hold it.
4867,THE NIGGER,
4868,THE NIGGER,"John Hardaway was fifty-nine, he had lived well, scornfully, and this"
4869,THE NIGGER,always makes the end easier; he had been a gentleman in the only way a
4870,THE NIGGER,Southerner has of being one—he never forgot that he was a Hardaway——
4871,THE NIGGER,
4872,THE NIGGER,He called out to her now:
4873,THE NIGGER,
4874,THE NIGGER,“When I die—leave the room.”
4875,THE NIGGER,
4876,THE NIGGER,"“Yes, sah,” she whispered sadly."
4877,THE NIGGER,
4878,THE NIGGER,“Bring me the broth.”
4879,THE NIGGER,
4880,THE NIGGER,"She brought it trembling. She was very tired and very hungry, and she"
4881,THE NIGGER,wanted to whistle but she only whispered:
4882,THE NIGGER,
4883,THE NIGGER,“Ain’t there nothing I kin do for you?”
4884,THE NIGGER,
4885,THE NIGGER,“Open the window.”
4886,THE NIGGER,
4887,THE NIGGER,"“It’s night air, sah——”"
4888,THE NIGGER,
4889,THE NIGGER,"“Open it, fool——”"
4890,THE NIGGER,
4891,THE NIGGER,She went to the window and opened it. She was handsome when she reached
4892,THE NIGGER,"up, and her nose was almost as excellent as certain Jewish noses; her"
4893,THE NIGGER,"throat was smooth, and it throbbed."
4894,THE NIGGER,
4895,THE NIGGER,Toward ten o’clock that night John Hardaway began to sing to himself. He
4896,THE NIGGER,"was fond of French, but what he learned in French he sang in English."
4897,THE NIGGER,
4898,THE NIGGER,"“Ah, my little one—I have held you on my knee——"
4899,THE NIGGER,
4900,THE NIGGER,“I have kissed your ears and throat——
4901,THE NIGGER,
4902,THE NIGGER,“Now I set you down——
4903,THE NIGGER,
4904,THE NIGGER,“You may do as you will.”
4905,THE NIGGER,
4906,THE NIGGER,"He tried to turn over—but failed, and so he lay there staring into the"
4907,THE NIGGER,fire.
4908,THE NIGGER,
4909,THE NIGGER,"At this point in the death of John Hardaway, Rabb, the nigger, came out"
4910,THE NIGGER,"of her corner, and ceased trembling. She was hungry and began heating"
4911,THE NIGGER,some soup in a saucepan.
4912,THE NIGGER,
4913,THE NIGGER,“What are you doing?” John Hardaway inquired abruptly.
4914,THE NIGGER,
4915,THE NIGGER,"“I’s hungry, sah.”"
4916,THE NIGGER,
4917,THE NIGGER,“Then get out of here—get into the kitchen.”
4918,THE NIGGER,
4919,THE NIGGER,"“Yes, sah,” but she did not move."
4920,THE NIGGER,
4921,THE NIGGER,"John Hardaway breathed heavily, a mist went over his eyes—presently,"
4922,THE NIGGER,"after interminable years, he lifted his lids. Rabb was now slowly"
4923,THE NIGGER,sipping the steaming soup.
4924,THE NIGGER,
4925,THE NIGGER,“You damned nigger!”
4926,THE NIGGER,
4927,THE NIGGER,"She got up from her haunches hurriedly—placing her hand in front of her,"
4928,THE NIGGER,backing toward the door.
4929,THE NIGGER,
4930,THE NIGGER,"“Little one, I have taken you on my knee——”"
4931,THE NIGGER,
4932,THE NIGGER,Rabb crept back—she came up to the bed.
4933,THE NIGGER,
4934,THE NIGGER,"“Massah, don’t you think——?”"
4935,THE NIGGER,
4936,THE NIGGER,“What?”
4937,THE NIGGER,
4938,THE NIGGER,“A priest—maybe?”
4939,THE NIGGER,
4940,THE NIGGER,“Fool!”
4941,THE NIGGER,
4942,THE NIGGER,"“Yes, sah, I only wanted to make safe.”"
4943,THE NIGGER,
4944,THE NIGGER,He tried to laugh. He pressed his knees together. He had forgotten her.
4945,THE NIGGER,
4946,THE NIGGER,Finally toward dawn he began to wander.
4947,THE NIGGER,
4948,THE NIGGER,Rabb moistened the roll of red flesh inside her lip and set her teeth.
4949,THE NIGGER,"She began to grin at nothing at all, stroking her hips."
4950,THE NIGGER,
4951,THE NIGGER,He called to her.
4952,THE NIGGER,
4953,THE NIGGER,“I want to tell you something.”
4954,THE NIGGER,
4955,THE NIGGER,She came forward—rolling her eyes.
4956,THE NIGGER,
4957,THE NIGGER,“Come closer.”
4958,THE NIGGER,
4959,THE NIGGER,She came.
4960,THE NIGGER,
4961,THE NIGGER,"“Lean down!” She leaned down, but already the saliva began to fill her"
4962,THE NIGGER,mouth.
4963,THE NIGGER,
4964,THE NIGGER,“Are you frightened?”
4965,THE NIGGER,
4966,THE NIGGER,"“No, sah,” she lied."
4967,THE NIGGER,
4968,THE NIGGER,"He raised his hand but it fell back, feebly. “Keep your place,” he"
4969,THE NIGGER,"whispered, and instantly went to sleep."
4970,THE NIGGER,
4971,THE NIGGER,"He began to rattle in his throat, while Rabb crouched in the corner,"
4972,THE NIGGER,holding her breasts in her folded arms and rocking softly on the balls
4973,THE NIGGER,of her feet.
4974,THE NIGGER,
4975,THE NIGGER,The rattling kept on. Rabb began creeping toward him on hands and knees.
4976,THE NIGGER,
4977,THE NIGGER,“Massah!”
4978,THE NIGGER,
4979,THE NIGGER,He did not move.
4980,THE NIGGER,
4981,THE NIGGER,“John!”
4982,THE NIGGER,
4983,THE NIGGER,He felt a strange sensation—he lifted his eyelids with their fringe of
4984,THE NIGGER,white lashes and almost inaudibly said:
4985,THE NIGGER,
4986,THE NIGGER,“Now go!”
4987,THE NIGGER,
4988,THE NIGGER,"He had closed his eyes a long time, when he was troubled with the"
4989,THE NIGGER,thought that someone was trying to get into his body as he left it. He
4990,THE NIGGER,"opened his eyes and there stood Rabb the nigger very close, looking down"
4991,THE NIGGER,at him.
4992,THE NIGGER,
4993,THE NIGGER,A gush of blood sprang from his nose.
4994,THE NIGGER,
4995,THE NIGGER,"“No, sah!”"
4996,THE NIGGER,
4997,THE NIGGER,He began to gasp. Rabb the nigger stood up to her full height and looked
4998,THE NIGGER,"down at him. She began to fan him, quickly. He breathed more hurriedly,"
4999,THE NIGGER,"his chest falling together like a house of cards. He tried to speak, he"
5000,THE NIGGER,could not.
5001,THE NIGGER,
5002,THE NIGGER,"Suddenly Rabb bent down and leaning her mouth to his, breathed into him,"
5003,THE NIGGER,"one great and powerful breath. His chest rose, he opened his eyes, said"
5004,THE NIGGER,“Ah!” and died.
5005,THE NIGGER,
5006,THE NIGGER,"Rabb ran her tongue along her lips, and raising her eyes, stared at a"
5007,THE NIGGER,spot on the wall a little higher than she was wont to. After a while she
5008,THE NIGGER,remembered her unfinished soup.

5017,LULLABY,I lived without trouble and I thought no harm;

5036,INDIAN SUMMER,
5037,INDIAN SUMMER,At the age of fifty-three Madame Boliver was young again. She was
5038,INDIAN SUMMER,suddenly swept away in a mad current of reckless and beautiful youth.
5039,INDIAN SUMMER,What she had done with those years that had counted up into such a
5040,INDIAN SUMMER,"perfect conclusion, she could not tell—it was a strange, vague dream."
5041,INDIAN SUMMER,"She had been plain, almost ugly, shy, an old maid. She was tall and"
5042,INDIAN SUMMER,awkward—she sat down as if she were going to break when she was in those
5043,INDIAN SUMMER,new years that girls call early bloom.
5044,INDIAN SUMMER,
5045,INDIAN SUMMER,When she was thirty she had been frankly and astonishingly Yankee; she
5046,INDIAN SUMMER,"came toward one with an erect and angular stride. She was severe, silent"
5047,INDIAN SUMMER,and curious. It was probably due to this that she was called Madame. She
5048,INDIAN SUMMER,"dressed in black outlined with white collar and cuffs, her hair was"
5049,INDIAN SUMMER,drawn straight back and showed large lobed and pale ears. The tight
5050,INDIAN SUMMER,drawn hair exposed her features to that utter and unlovely nakedness
5051,INDIAN SUMMER,that some clean rooms are exposed to by the catching back of heavy and
5052,INDIAN SUMMER,melancholy curtains—she looked out upon life with that same unaccustomed
5053,INDIAN SUMMER,and expectant expression that best rooms wear when thrown open for the
5054,INDIAN SUMMER,one yearly festivity that proclaims their owners well to do.
5055,INDIAN SUMMER,
5056,INDIAN SUMMER,She had no friends and could not keep acquaintances—her speech was
5057,INDIAN SUMMER,"sharp, quick and truthful. She spoke seldom, but with such fierce"
5058,INDIAN SUMMER,"strictness and accuracy that those who came into contact with her once,"
5059,INDIAN SUMMER,took precautions not to be thus exposed a second time.
5060,INDIAN SUMMER,
5061,INDIAN SUMMER,She grew older steadily and without regret—long before the age of thirty
5062,INDIAN SUMMER,she had given up all expectations of a usual life or any hopes of that
5063,INDIAN SUMMER,"called “unusual”; she walked in a straight path between the two, and she"
5064,INDIAN SUMMER,was content and speculated little upon this thing in her that had made
5065,INDIAN SUMMER,her unloved and unlovely.
5066,INDIAN SUMMER,
5067,INDIAN SUMMER,Her sisters had married and fallen away about her as blossoms are
5068,INDIAN SUMMER,"carried off, leaving the stalk—their children came like bits of pollen"
5069,INDIAN SUMMER,"and she enjoyed them and was mildly happy. Once she, too, had dreamed of"
5070,INDIAN SUMMER,"love, but that was before she had attained to the age of seventeen—by"
5071,INDIAN SUMMER,that time she knew that no one could or would ask for her hand—she was
5072,INDIAN SUMMER,plain and unattractive and she was satisfied.
5073,INDIAN SUMMER,
5074,INDIAN SUMMER,She had become at once the drudge and the adviser—all things were laid
5075,INDIAN SUMMER,upon her both to solve and to produce. She laboured for others easily
5076,INDIAN SUMMER,and willingly and they let her labour.
5077,INDIAN SUMMER,
5078,INDIAN SUMMER,At fifty-three she blazed into a riotous Indian Summer of loveliness.
5079,INDIAN SUMMER,She was tall and magnificent. She carried with her a flavour of some
5080,INDIAN SUMMER,exotic flower; she exhaled something that savoured of those excellences
5081,INDIAN SUMMER,of odour and tone akin to pain and to pleasure; she lent a plastic
5082,INDIAN SUMMER,embodiment to all hitherto unembodied things. She was like some rare
5083,INDIAN SUMMER,"wood, carved into a melting form—she breathed abruptly as one who has"
5084,INDIAN SUMMER,been dead for half a century.
5085,INDIAN SUMMER,
5086,INDIAN SUMMER,"Her face, it is true, was not that plump, downy and senseless"
5087,INDIAN SUMMER,countenance of the early young—it was thin and dark and marked with a
5088,INDIAN SUMMER,few very sensitive wrinkles; about the mouth there were signs of a
5089,INDIAN SUMMER,"humour she had never possessed, of a love she had never known, of a joy"
5090,INDIAN SUMMER,she had never experienced and of a wisdom impossible for her to have
5091,INDIAN SUMMER,"acquired. Her still, curious eyes with their blue-white borders and the"
5092,INDIAN SUMMER,"splendid irises were half veiled by strange dusty lids. The hair, that"
5093,INDIAN SUMMER,"had once been drawn back, was still drawn back, but no appallingly"
5094,INDIAN SUMMER,severe features were laid bare. Instead the hair seemed to confer a
5095,INDIAN SUMMER,"favour on all those who might look upon its restrained luxury, for it"
5096,INDIAN SUMMER,uncovered a face at once valuable and unusual.
5097,INDIAN SUMMER,
5098,INDIAN SUMMER,"Her smile was rich in colour—the scarlet of her gums, the strange"
5099,INDIAN SUMMER,"whiteness of her teeth, the moisture of the sensitive mouth, all seemed"
5100,INDIAN SUMMER,as if Madame Boliver were something dyed through with perfect and rare
5101,INDIAN SUMMER,life.
5102,INDIAN SUMMER,
5103,INDIAN SUMMER,"Now when she entered a room everyone paused, looking up and speaking"
5104,INDIAN SUMMER,together. She was quite conscious of this and it pleased her—not because
5105,INDIAN SUMMER,"she was too unutterably vain, but because it was so new and so"
5106,INDIAN SUMMER,unexpected.
5107,INDIAN SUMMER,
5108,INDIAN SUMMER,For a while her very youth satisfied her—she lived with herself as
5109,INDIAN SUMMER,though she were a second person who had been permitted access to the
5110,INDIAN SUMMER,presence of some lovely and some longed-for dream.
5111,INDIAN SUMMER,
5112,INDIAN SUMMER,She did not know what to do. If she could have found religion newly with
5113,INDIAN SUMMER,her new youth she would have worshipped and have been profoundly glad of
5114,INDIAN SUMMER,"the kneeling down and the rising up attendant with faith, but this was a"
5115,INDIAN SUMMER,part of her old childhood and it did not serve.
5116,INDIAN SUMMER,
5117,INDIAN SUMMER,She had prayed then because she was ugly; she could not pray now because
5118,INDIAN SUMMER,"she was beautiful—she wanted something new to stand before, to speak to."
5119,INDIAN SUMMER,
5120,INDIAN SUMMER,"One by one the old and awkward things went, leaving in their wake"
5121,INDIAN SUMMER,"Venetian glass and bowls of onyx, silks, cushions and perfume. Her books"
5122,INDIAN SUMMER,"became magazines with quaint, unsurpassable and daring illustrations."
5123,INDIAN SUMMER,
5124,INDIAN SUMMER,Presently she had a salon. She was the rage. Gentlemen in political
5125,INDIAN SUMMER,"whiskers, pomaded and curled, left their coats in the embrace of pompous"
5126,INDIAN SUMMER,and refined footmen.
5127,INDIAN SUMMER,
5128,INDIAN SUMMER,Young students with boutonnières and ambitions came; an emissary or two
5129,INDIAN SUMMER,"dropped in, proffered their hearts and departed. Poets and musicians,"
5130,INDIAN SUMMER,"littérateurs and artists experimenting in the modern, grouped themselves"
5131,INDIAN SUMMER,about her mantels like butterflies over bonbons and poured sentiment
5132,INDIAN SUMMER,upon sentiment into her ears.
5133,INDIAN SUMMER,
5134,INDIAN SUMMER,Several gentlemen of leisure and millions courted her furiously with
5135,INDIAN SUMMER,small tears in the corners of their alert eyes. Middle-aged professors
5136,INDIAN SUMMER,and one deacon were among the crowd that filled her handsome apartment
5137,INDIAN SUMMER,on those days when she entertained.
5138,INDIAN SUMMER,
5139,INDIAN SUMMER,There was something about Madame Boliver that could not quite succumb to
5140,INDIAN SUMMER,"herself. She was still afraid; she would start, draw her hand away and"
5141,INDIAN SUMMER,pale abruptly in the middle of some ardent proposal—she would hurry to
5142,INDIAN SUMMER,"the mirror at such times, though she never turned her head to look in."
5143,INDIAN SUMMER,
5144,INDIAN SUMMER,"Was it possible that she was beautiful now? And if so, would it remain?"
5145,INDIAN SUMMER,"And her heart said, “Yes, it will remain,” until at last she believed"
5146,INDIAN SUMMER,it.
5147,INDIAN SUMMER,
5148,INDIAN SUMMER,She put the past behind her and tried to forget it. It hurt her to
5149,INDIAN SUMMER,"remember it, as if it were something that she had done in a moment of"
5150,INDIAN SUMMER,absent-mindedness and of which she had to be ashamed. She remembered it
5151,INDIAN SUMMER,as one remembers some small wrong deed hidden for years. She thought
5152,INDIAN SUMMER,about her past unattractiveness as another would have thought of some
5153,INDIAN SUMMER,cruelty. Her eyes watered when she remembered her way of looking at
5154,INDIAN SUMMER,herself in her twenties. Her mouth trembled when she thought back to its
5155,INDIAN SUMMER,severity and its sharp retorts.
5156,INDIAN SUMMER,
5157,INDIAN SUMMER,Her very body reproached her for all that had been forced upon it in her
5158,INDIAN SUMMER,"other youth, and a strange passion came upon her, turning her memory of"
5159,INDIAN SUMMER,her sisters into something at times like that hatred felt by the
5160,INDIAN SUMMER,oppressed who remember the oppression when it has given way to plenty.
5161,INDIAN SUMMER,
5162,INDIAN SUMMER,"But now she was free. She expanded, she sang, she dreamed for long"
5163,INDIAN SUMMER,"hours, her elbows upon the casement, looking out into the garden. She"
5164,INDIAN SUMMER,"smiled, remembering the old custom of serenading, and wondered when she,"
5165,INDIAN SUMMER,"too, would know it."
5166,INDIAN SUMMER,
5167,INDIAN SUMMER,That she was fifty-three never troubled her. It never even occurred to
5168,INDIAN SUMMER,"her. She had been fifty-three long ago at twenty, and now she was twenty"
5169,INDIAN SUMMER,"at fifty-three, that was all—this was compensation, and if she had been"
5170,INDIAN SUMMER,through her middle age in youth she could go through her youth in middle
5171,INDIAN SUMMER,age.
5172,INDIAN SUMMER,
5173,INDIAN SUMMER,At times she thought how much more beautiful nature is in its
5174,INDIAN SUMMER,treacheries than its remedies.
5175,INDIAN SUMMER,
5176,INDIAN SUMMER,"Those who hovered about her offered, time on time, to marry her, to"
5177,INDIAN SUMMER,"carry her away into Italy or to Spain, to lavish money and devotion on"
5178,INDIAN SUMMER,"her, and in the beginning she had been almost too ready to accept them"
5179,INDIAN SUMMER,"in their assurances, because the very assurances were so new and so"
5180,INDIAN SUMMER,delightful.
5181,INDIAN SUMMER,
5182,INDIAN SUMMER,"But in spite of it she was, somewhere beneath her youth, old enough to"
5183,INDIAN SUMMER,"know that she did not love as she would love, and she waited with a"
5184,INDIAN SUMMER,patience made pleasant by the constant attentions of the multitude.
5185,INDIAN SUMMER,
5186,INDIAN SUMMER,"And then Petkoff, “the Russian,” had come, accompanied by one of the"
5187,INDIAN SUMMER,younger students.
5188,INDIAN SUMMER,
5189,INDIAN SUMMER,A heavy fur cap came down to the borders of his squinting and piercing
5190,INDIAN SUMMER,eyes. He wore a mixture of clothing that proclaimed him at once foreign
5191,INDIAN SUMMER,and poor. His small moustache barely covered sensitive and well shaped
5192,INDIAN SUMMER,"lips, and the little line of hair that reached down on each side of his"
5193,INDIAN SUMMER,"close-set ears gave him an early period expression as if he, too, in"
5194,INDIAN SUMMER,"spite of his few years, might have lived in the time when she was a"
5195,INDIAN SUMMER,girl.
5196,INDIAN SUMMER,
5197,INDIAN SUMMER,"He could not have been much over thirty, perhaps just thirty—he said"
5198,INDIAN SUMMER,little but never took his eyes off the object of his interest.
5199,INDIAN SUMMER,
5200,INDIAN SUMMER,"He spoke well enough, with an occasional lapse into Russian, which was"
5201,INDIAN SUMMER,very piquant. He swept aside all other aspirants with his steady and
5202,INDIAN SUMMER,centred gaze. He ignored the rest of the company so completely as to rob
5203,INDIAN SUMMER,him of rudeness. If one is ignorant of the very presence of his fellow
5204,INDIAN SUMMER,"beings, at most he can only be called “strange.”"
5205,INDIAN SUMMER,
5206,INDIAN SUMMER,Petkoff was both an ambitious and a self-centred man—all his qualities
5207,INDIAN SUMMER,"were decisive and not hesitatingly crooked, providing he needed"
5208,INDIAN SUMMER,crookedness to win his point. He was attractive to Madame Boliver
5209,INDIAN SUMMER,"because he was as strange as she was herself, her youth was foreign, and"
5210,INDIAN SUMMER,so was Petkoff.
5211,INDIAN SUMMER,
5212,INDIAN SUMMER,He had come to this country to start a venture that promised to be
5213,INDIAN SUMMER,"successful; in the meantime, he had to be careful both in person and in"
5214,INDIAN SUMMER,heart.
5215,INDIAN SUMMER,
5216,INDIAN SUMMER,What he felt for Madame Boliver was at first astonishment that such a
5217,INDIAN SUMMER,"woman was still unmarried; he knew nothing of her past, and guessed at"
5218,INDIAN SUMMER,her age much below the real figure. After a while this astonishment gave
5219,INDIAN SUMMER,way to pleasure and then to real and very sincere love.
5220,INDIAN SUMMER,
5221,INDIAN SUMMER,"He began to pay court to her, neglecting his business a little and"
5222,INDIAN SUMMER,"worrying over that end of it, but persisting, nevertheless."
5223,INDIAN SUMMER,
5224,INDIAN SUMMER,"He could see that she, on her side, was becoming deeply attached to him."
5225,INDIAN SUMMER,He would walk about in the park for hours arguing this affair out to
5226,INDIAN SUMMER,himself. Both the shoulds and should nots.
5227,INDIAN SUMMER,
5228,INDIAN SUMMER,It got him nowhere except into a state of impatience. He liked clear-cut
5229,INDIAN SUMMER,"acts and he could not decide to go or stay. As it was, nothing could be"
5230,INDIAN SUMMER,worse for his business than this same feverish indecision. He made up
5231,INDIAN SUMMER,his mind.
5232,INDIAN SUMMER,
5233,INDIAN SUMMER,Madame Boliver was radiantly happy. She began to draw away from a life
5234,INDIAN SUMMER,"of entertainment and, instead, turned most of her energies into the"
5235,INDIAN SUMMER,"adoration of her first real love. She accepted him promptly, and with a"
5236,INDIAN SUMMER,"touch of her old firm and sharp decisiveness, and a hint of her utter"
5237,INDIAN SUMMER,frankness. He told her that she took him as she would have taken a piece
5238,INDIAN SUMMER,"of cake at a tea party, and they both laughed."
5239,INDIAN SUMMER,
5240,INDIAN SUMMER,That was in the Winter. Madame Boliver was fifty-five—he never asked her
5241,INDIAN SUMMER,how old she was and she never thought to tell him. They set the day for
5242,INDIAN SUMMER,their wedding early in the following June.
5243,INDIAN SUMMER,
5244,INDIAN SUMMER,"They were profoundly happy. One by one the younger, more ardent admirers"
5245,INDIAN SUMMER,"fell off, but very slowly; they turned their heads a little as they"
5246,INDIAN SUMMER,"went, being both too vain and too skeptical to believe that this would"
5247,INDIAN SUMMER,last.
5248,INDIAN SUMMER,
5249,INDIAN SUMMER,"She still held receptions and still her rooms were flooded, but when"
5250,INDIAN SUMMER,"Petkoff entered, a little better dressed but still a bit heedless of the"
5251,INDIAN SUMMER,"throng, they hushed their highest hilarities and spoke of the new novels"
5252,INDIAN SUMMER,and the newest trend in art.
5253,INDIAN SUMMER,
5254,INDIAN SUMMER,Petkoff had taken notice of them to that degree necessary to a man who
5255,INDIAN SUMMER,"knows what he has won, and from whom and how many. He looked upon them"
5256,INDIAN SUMMER,"casually, but with a hint of well-being."
5257,INDIAN SUMMER,
5258,INDIAN SUMMER,"Madame Boliver grew more beautiful, more radiant, more easeful. Her"
5259,INDIAN SUMMER,"movements began to resemble flowing water; she was almost too happy, too"
5260,INDIAN SUMMER,"supple, too conscious of her well-being. She became arrogant, but still"
5261,INDIAN SUMMER,"splendid; she became vain, but still gracious; she became accustomed to"
5262,INDIAN SUMMER,"herself, but still reflective. She could be said to have bloomed at too"
5263,INDIAN SUMMER,"auspicious an age; she was old enough to appreciate it, and this is a"
5264,INDIAN SUMMER,very dangerous thing.
5265,INDIAN SUMMER,
5266,INDIAN SUMMER,She spent hours at the hair dresser’s and the dressmaker’s. Her dressing
5267,INDIAN SUMMER,table resembled a battlefield. It supported all the armament for keeping
5268,INDIAN SUMMER,"age at a distance. She rode in the avenue in an open carriage, and"
5269,INDIAN SUMMER,smiled when the society notices mentioned her name and ran her picture.
5270,INDIAN SUMMER,
5271,INDIAN SUMMER,"She finally gave one the impression of being beautiful, but too"
5272,INDIAN SUMMER,"conscious of it; talented, but too vain; easy of carriage, but too"
5273,INDIAN SUMMER,"reliant on it; of being strange and rare and wonderful, but a little too"
5274,INDIAN SUMMER,"strange, a little too rare, a little too wonderful. She became"
5275,INDIAN SUMMER,"magnificently complex to outward appearances, yet in her soul Madame"
5276,INDIAN SUMMER,"Boliver still kept her honesty, her frankness and her simplicity."
5277,INDIAN SUMMER,
5278,INDIAN SUMMER,And then one day Madame Boliver took to her bed. It began with a
5279,INDIAN SUMMER,headache and ended with severe chills. She hoped to get up on the
5280,INDIAN SUMMER,"following day, and she remained there a week; she put her party off,"
5281,INDIAN SUMMER,"expecting to be able to be about, but instead she gave it sitting in a"
5282,INDIAN SUMMER,chair supported by cushions.
5283,INDIAN SUMMER,
5284,INDIAN SUMMER,Petkoff was worried and morose. He had given a good deal of time to
5285,INDIAN SUMMER,"Madame Boliver, and he cared for her in a selfish and all-engrossing"
5286,INDIAN SUMMER,way. When she stood up no longer he broke a Venetian tumbler by throwing
5287,INDIAN SUMMER,it into the fireplace. When she laughed at this he suddenly burst out
5288,INDIAN SUMMER,"into very heavy weeping. She tried to comfort him, but he would not be"
5289,INDIAN SUMMER,"comforted. She promised him that she would walk soon, as a mother"
5290,INDIAN SUMMER,"promises a child some longed-for object. When she said, “I will be well,"
5291,INDIAN SUMMER,"dear, soon; after all I’m a young woman,” he stopped and looked at her"
5292,INDIAN SUMMER,through a film of painful tears.
5293,INDIAN SUMMER,
5294,INDIAN SUMMER,"“But are you?” he said, voicing for the first time his inner fear."
5295,INDIAN SUMMER,
5296,INDIAN SUMMER,And it was then that the horror of the situation dawned upon her. In
5297,INDIAN SUMMER,"youth, when youth comes rightly, there is old age in which to lose it"
5298,INDIAN SUMMER,"complacently, but when it comes in old age there is no time to watch it"
5299,INDIAN SUMMER,go.
5300,INDIAN SUMMER,
5301,INDIAN SUMMER,She sat up and stared at him.
5302,INDIAN SUMMER,
5303,INDIAN SUMMER,"“Why, yes,” she said in a flat and firm voice, “that’s so. I am no"
5304,INDIAN SUMMER,longer of few years.”
5305,INDIAN SUMMER,
5306,INDIAN SUMMER,"She could not say “no longer young,” because she was young."
5307,INDIAN SUMMER,
5308,INDIAN SUMMER,“It will make no difference.”
5309,INDIAN SUMMER,
5310,INDIAN SUMMER,"“Ah,” she said, “it will make no difference to you, but it will make a"
5311,INDIAN SUMMER,difference to us.”
5312,INDIAN SUMMER,
5313,INDIAN SUMMER,"She lay back and sighed, and presently she asked him to leave her a"
5314,INDIAN SUMMER,little while.
5315,INDIAN SUMMER,
5316,INDIAN SUMMER,When he had gone she summoned the doctor.
5317,INDIAN SUMMER,
5318,INDIAN SUMMER,She said: “My friend—am I dying—so soon?”
5319,INDIAN SUMMER,
5320,INDIAN SUMMER,"He shook his head emphatically. “Of course not,” he assured her; “we"
5321,INDIAN SUMMER,will have you up in a week or so.”
5322,INDIAN SUMMER,
5323,INDIAN SUMMER,"“What is it, then, that keeps me here now?”"
5324,INDIAN SUMMER,
5325,INDIAN SUMMER,"“You have tired yourself out, that is all. You see, such extensive"
5326,INDIAN SUMMER,"entertaining, my dear madame, will tax the youngest of us.” He shook his"
5327,INDIAN SUMMER,head at this and twisted his moustache. She sent him away also.
5328,INDIAN SUMMER,
5329,INDIAN SUMMER,The next few days were happy ones. She felt better. She sat up without
5330,INDIAN SUMMER,fatigue. She was joyful in Petkoff’s renewed affections. He had been
5331,INDIAN SUMMER,"frightened, and he lavished more extravagant praise and endearing terms"
5332,INDIAN SUMMER,"on her than ever before. He was like a man who, seeing his fortune go,"
5333,INDIAN SUMMER,found how dear it was to him after all and how necessary when it
5334,INDIAN SUMMER,returned to him. By almost losing her he appreciated what he should have
5335,INDIAN SUMMER,felt if he had lost her indeed.
5336,INDIAN SUMMER,
5337,INDIAN SUMMER,It got to be a joke between them that they had held any fears at all. At
5338,INDIAN SUMMER,the club he beat his friends on the back and cried:
5339,INDIAN SUMMER,
5340,INDIAN SUMMER,"“Gentlemen, a beautiful and young woman.” And they used to beat his"
5341,INDIAN SUMMER,"back, exclaiming: “Lucky, by God!”"
5342,INDIAN SUMMER,
5343,INDIAN SUMMER,"She ordered a large stock of wine and cakes for the wedding party,"
5344,INDIAN SUMMER,bought some new Venetian glasses and indulged in a few rare old carpets
5345,INDIAN SUMMER,"for the floor. She had quite a fancy, too, for a new gown offered at a"
5346,INDIAN SUMMER,"remarkably low sum, but she began to curb herself, for she had been very"
5347,INDIAN SUMMER,extravagant as it was.
5348,INDIAN SUMMER,
5349,INDIAN SUMMER,And then one day she died.
5350,INDIAN SUMMER,
5351,INDIAN SUMMER,"Petkoff came in a wild, strange mood. Four candles were burning at head"
5352,INDIAN SUMMER,"and feet, and Madame Boliver was more lovely than ever. Stamping, so"
5353,INDIAN SUMMER,"that he sent up little spirals of dust from the newly acquired carpet,"
5354,INDIAN SUMMER,Petkoff strode up and down beside the bier. He leaned over and lit a
5355,INDIAN SUMMER,cigarette by one of the flickering flames of the candles. Madame
5356,INDIAN SUMMER,"Boliver’s elderly sister, who was kneeling, coughed and looked"
5357,INDIAN SUMMER,"reproachfully upward at the figure of Petkoff, who had once again"
5358,INDIAN SUMMER,"forgotten everyone and everything. “Damn it!” he said, putting his"
5359,INDIAN SUMMER,fingers into his vest.

5383,THE RABBIT,
5384,THE RABBIT,
5385,THE RABBIT,"The road was covered with red and yellow leaves. Rugo Amietieve, who"
5386,THE RABBIT,"said that he was an Armenian, had wished one of those lingering"
5387,THE RABBIT,good-byes to this rotund and plentiful day that only a man of slow and
5388,THE RABBIT,methodical mind can bring into being. He bid it adieu with more than the
5389,THE RABBIT,"silence and the love of his heart; he had whispered over it, his square"
5390,THE RABBIT,yellow teeth a little apart and touching the moist curve of his
5391,THE RABBIT,under-lip with the small round point of flesh that clung to his upper
5392,THE RABBIT,"like a tear. He said good-bye resolutely and quite peacefully, with the"
5393,THE RABBIT,restraint of a man who knows what’s bad for him and why. Rugo did not
5394,THE RABBIT,"want to leave the country, but he had to. He knew why he did not want"
5395,THE RABBIT,"to, and he knew why he was being forced to—necessity—that was it,"
5396,THE RABBIT,necessity had been hurrying his people about the world from the
5397,THE RABBIT,beginning of time and would hurry them.
5398,THE RABBIT,
5399,THE RABBIT,"Farewell held no piquancy for him, he did not tear out his heart by his"
5400,THE RABBIT,departure; there was nothing in the fact of the sunlight and the blowing
5401,THE RABBIT,and dying leaves that gave him sweet pain and too heavy sorrow; the red
5402,THE RABBIT,of the fallen apples sent no pang into the very midst of his being. On
5403,THE RABBIT,the contrary Rugo Amietieve felt only that sense of loss that a good
5404,THE RABBIT,housewife feels when she is letting a rich quilt out of her fingers. In
5405,THE RABBIT,"the soil, as Rugo had known it, had been life, hard and fragrant. He had"
5406,THE RABBIT,"toiled at the plough grumbling, but sensing, with a slow, precise"
5407,THE RABBIT,"pleasure, that the air was warm and good and healthy. He had tended his"
5408,THE RABBIT,"geese and his cows with the same stolid satisfaction, and he watched"
5409,THE RABBIT,"them moving about, leaning on his two folded and brown hands. The ducks’"
5410,THE RABBIT,"yellow, gaping mouths gave him physical pleasure, he would have liked to"
5411,THE RABBIT,press his hand over them where they were all shining and brittle; it
5412,THE RABBIT,"would have given him as much pleasure as a flower petal—more, because"
5413,THE RABBIT,these living things that cackled and spread their wings and brought
5414,THE RABBIT,"forth young were profitable also—the world lived here and moved, and its"
5415,THE RABBIT,incidental placing of him where he could profit by it was the thing that
5416,THE RABBIT,amazed and satisfied him.
5417,THE RABBIT,
5418,THE RABBIT,"Now it was otherwise. He must go away into the city where, they said,"
5419,THE RABBIT,"nothing was fresh and new and living. His uncle had died, leaving him"
5420,THE RABBIT,his little tailoring establishment on the East Side. There Rugo was
5421,THE RABBIT,"bound, there from this day forward he would sit and sew interminably as"
5422,THE RABBIT,though he were a machine—as though he had suddenly died and had to work.
5423,THE RABBIT,
5424,THE RABBIT,He lifted his straight nose and smelled the September air. Here the
5425,THE RABBIT,"woods dipped over the road, spilling shadows gigantic and restless, with"
5426,THE RABBIT,a speckling of ragged sun patches like flowers. Mosquitoes came up from
5427,THE RABBIT,the swamp as the night descended and sang about Rugo’s ears and set him
5428,THE RABBIT,"swearing. They got into the long, tangled meshes of his beard and clung"
5429,THE RABBIT,"there; they sat in among these thick, ruddy strands and hissed against"
5430,THE RABBIT,the shuddering flesh of his cheeks. He lifted one of his hands and
5431,THE RABBIT,"struck his face on either side, and went on."
5432,THE RABBIT,
5433,THE RABBIT,"The next morning the East Side, in the early Thirties, saw a stranger"
5434,THE RABBIT,sweeping out what had been old Amietieve’s shop. Rugo looked about him
5435,THE RABBIT,with sad eyes. The room was twelve feet by twenty-four and the back part
5436,THE RABBIT,"was curtained off by a hanging of dull green, sprinkled over with pink"
5437,THE RABBIT,roses; a small cot bed was thus hidden from the front of the shop. It
5438,THE RABBIT,"was within these four walls that Rugo must live. He turned around in it,"
5439,THE RABBIT,"sniffing the air with his long nose, laid back again as he had done in"
5440,THE RABBIT,"the last hour in the country. He sneered. “You’re a little fool room,”"
5441,THE RABBIT,"he said, “to be so small.” It was as if he were shaking it, as a child"
5442,THE RABBIT,is shaken and held up to learn by another’s larger and more important
5443,THE RABBIT,example. He held this room up by the scruff of its neck and shook it in
5444,THE RABBIT,"the face of the thirty acres he had known, and he sneered upon it."
5445,THE RABBIT,
5446,THE RABBIT,"He had learned the trade when still a child, when this same uncle had"
5447,THE RABBIT,"been guardian, but his fingers were freedom clumsy and he broke the"
5448,THE RABBIT,needle.
5449,THE RABBIT,
5450,THE RABBIT,"Work came hesitatingly and painfully. Rugo was a slow man, and at this"
5451,THE RABBIT,task he was still more laborious and backward. He toiled far into the
5452,THE RABBIT,"night seated upon his table, his goose between his knees. People walking"
5453,THE RABBIT,by on their way home sometimes peered in over the top of the cardboard
5454,THE RABBIT,"sign specked by the flies and the open fashion book with its strange,"
5455,THE RABBIT,"angular, shiny gentlemen carrying canes and looking over their shoulders"
5456,THE RABBIT,playfully as if they were keeping something very amusing in their minds
5457,THE RABBIT,"to hand out like favours; and such people often said, “That chap will"
5458,THE RABBIT,"die of consumption, you see.”"
5459,THE RABBIT,
5460,THE RABBIT,The butcher’s shop across the way seemed to be vying with the remnants
5461,THE RABBIT,of silks and serge in Rugo’s window. There were rump ends and flanks and
5462,THE RABBIT,"knuckle bones, remnants of some fine animal, all wonderful and red and"
5463,THE RABBIT,"satiny yellow where the layers of fat crept out like frostings, or where"
5464,THE RABBIT,fat spread over kidneys like irregular lace; yet to Rugo they were
5465,THE RABBIT,"somehow painful, they made him think of the cows and the poultry that he"
5466,THE RABBIT,"had so often gazed fondly upon, of the animal life he had grown up"
5467,THE RABBIT,"among, and he turned his head away and went on stitching."
5468,THE RABBIT,
5469,THE RABBIT,"Rugo got his own breakfast, lunch, dinner. Behind the curtain there,"
5470,THE RABBIT,"beside his bed, was a small gas stove. In the Winter the shop was deadly"
5471,THE RABBIT,with heavy air. He could not open the door or he would have flooded the
5472,THE RABBIT,"place in a moment with cold, piercing and cruel, so he sat in the foul"
5473,THE RABBIT,"air of a gas burner, and his eyes grew so dark in the paling face that"
5474,THE RABBIT,the children of the neighbourhood called him “Coal Eye.”
5475,THE RABBIT,
5476,THE RABBIT,"In the Summer business had picked up, though Rugo seldom had any time to"
5477,THE RABBIT,"himself. He worked quicker, but then orders were more plentiful on"
5478,THE RABBIT,"patches, turnings and pressings. He had become attached to a small, ill"
5479,THE RABBIT,and very slender Italian girl who came once with her father’s coat.
5480,THE RABBIT,
5481,THE RABBIT,"Her straight parted dark hair made him think of animals, he thought her"
5482,THE RABBIT,"gentle and Madonna-like, not taking into account a small, cruel and"
5483,THE RABBIT,avaricious mouth. It was very red and he was pleased with it. Almost
5484,THE RABBIT,anything bright pleased him. The very fact that these lips were cruel
5485,THE RABBIT,"pleased him, though he did not know that it was the brightness of"
5486,THE RABBIT,calculation that made them attractive to him.
5487,THE RABBIT,
5488,THE RABBIT,"Rugo was not a good-looking man, but this did not trouble him; he was as"
5489,THE RABBIT,"good-looking as anyone he had ever seen, and therefore he was"
5490,THE RABBIT,"unconscious that for so large a head, his body was rather small."
5491,THE RABBIT,
5492,THE RABBIT,"This girl Addie told him. It hurt him, because he was beginning to like"
5493,THE RABBIT,her. He noticed that when his lip trembled her eyes got very bright.
5494,THE RABBIT,"“Why,” he asked her, puzzled, “do you always look so pretty when you say"
5495,THE RABBIT,things like that?”
5496,THE RABBIT,
5497,THE RABBIT,"This flattered her, but it only made it worse for Rugo. She was indeed a"
5498,THE RABBIT,"very common woman, with a little to make her young and pretty, and she"
5499,THE RABBIT,made the most of it.
5500,THE RABBIT,
5501,THE RABBIT,Finally he spoke to her quietly and slowly about love and marriage. Of
5502,THE RABBIT,"course Addie, in her shrewd mind, had calculated on this; his was a"
5503,THE RABBIT,"business that threatened to prosper, and she was attracted to him,"
5504,THE RABBIT,anyway. She made her plans accordingly; she acted displeased.
5505,THE RABBIT,
5506,THE RABBIT,"“You are a poor, common tradesman,” she said bitterly, as if she were"
5507,THE RABBIT,"something uncommon and therefore beyond him. He felt this, too, and"
5508,THE RABBIT,"instead of discovering her own smallness in the retort, he only got the"
5509,THE RABBIT,point she wanted him to get. He began to think himself below her. He
5510,THE RABBIT,raised his hand:
5511,THE RABBIT,
5512,THE RABBIT,“What do you want that I shall do?”
5513,THE RABBIT,
5514,THE RABBIT,"She shrugged her narrow shoulders and laughed, showing a red tongue that"
5515,THE RABBIT,"seemed to crouch in her mouth in a long, dented line."
5516,THE RABBIT,
5517,THE RABBIT,"“But I must do something, you say I am only——”"
5518,THE RABBIT,
5519,THE RABBIT,“You shall never be anything else.”
5520,THE RABBIT,
5521,THE RABBIT,"“True, but I may be more.”"
5522,THE RABBIT,
5523,THE RABBIT,“Hardly.”
5524,THE RABBIT,
5525,THE RABBIT,“Why do you say ‘hardly’?”
5526,THE RABBIT,
5527,THE RABBIT,"“You are not the sort of person—now, for instance——”"
5528,THE RABBIT,
5529,THE RABBIT,"“Yes?” he questioned slowly, turning around and looking into her face."
5530,THE RABBIT,
5531,THE RABBIT,"“Well, for instance, you are hardly a hero.”"
5532,THE RABBIT,
5533,THE RABBIT,“Are heroes the style?” he asked pitifully. This made her laugh even
5534,THE RABBIT,harder.
5535,THE RABBIT,
5536,THE RABBIT,"“Not in your family, I take it.”"
5537,THE RABBIT,
5538,THE RABBIT,"He nodded. “Yes, that’s true—we were always quiet people. You do not"
5539,THE RABBIT,like quiet people?”
5540,THE RABBIT,
5541,THE RABBIT,"“They are like women,” she answered."
5542,THE RABBIT,
5543,THE RABBIT,He pondered awhile over this. He shook his head; after all he knew
5544,THE RABBIT,better and he was angry because he had been letting Addie lie to him.
5545,THE RABBIT,
5546,THE RABBIT,“That is not true.”
5547,THE RABBIT,
5548,THE RABBIT,She began to scream at him:
5549,THE RABBIT,
5550,THE RABBIT,"“So, that’s the way you begin, calling me a liar, is it?” She put her"
5551,THE RABBIT,hands into her hair on either side and tore at it. This had even more of
5552,THE RABBIT,an effect upon Rugo than she had expected. He beat his hands together.
5553,THE RABBIT,"In spoiling the perfect oval of her head, in ruinously shaking its"
5554,THE RABBIT,"smooth and parted hair, she had hurt him as much as if she had shaken a"
5555,THE RABBIT,holy picture.
5556,THE RABBIT,
5557,THE RABBIT,"“No, no,” he cried. “I will do something, you shall see—it is all"
5558,THE RABBIT,"right—it is all right.” He approached her and, touching her shoulder"
5559,THE RABBIT,"with his hand, he added:"
5560,THE RABBIT,
5561,THE RABBIT,“For you I will do it—I will do it.”
5562,THE RABBIT,
5563,THE RABBIT,"She smiled. “You will do what, Rugo Amietieve?”"
5564,THE RABBIT,
5565,THE RABBIT,"“I shall be less like a woman. You called me like a woman; well, you"
5566,THE RABBIT,shall see.”
5567,THE RABBIT,
5568,THE RABBIT,"She came close to him, her two thin arms pressed close to her side."
5569,THE RABBIT,
5570,THE RABBIT,“You will do something big and grand—Rugo—for me?”
5571,THE RABBIT,
5572,THE RABBIT,"He looked down at her, puzzled and quiet. The cruel mouth was half open,"
5573,THE RABBIT,"showing the shining line of her teeth. He nodded, but this time he moved"
5574,THE RABBIT,away from her and stood staring out into the street.
5575,THE RABBIT,
5576,THE RABBIT,"She came up behind him, caught both of his hands, and, leaning forward,"
5577,THE RABBIT,"kissed him on the back of his neck. He tried to turn, but she held his"
5578,THE RABBIT,two hands a moment longer and then broke out of the shop at a run.
5579,THE RABBIT,
5580,THE RABBIT,"Presently he set to work again, sitting cross-legged on his table."
5581,THE RABBIT,
5582,THE RABBIT,He wondered what he was expected to do. He had often spoken to her of
5583,THE RABBIT,"returning to the country, with a hint in his voice that she would be"
5584,THE RABBIT,"there beside him, too. Now it had come to this."
5585,THE RABBIT,
5586,THE RABBIT,He pondered. A hero—what was a hero—what made the difference between a
5587,THE RABBIT,"hero and himself, anyway? He remembered tales the gypsies had told him"
5588,THE RABBIT,about their greatest men when he had been in the old land of his birth.
5589,THE RABBIT,"They told a story of a lad who fought and fought, and finding himself"
5590,THE RABBIT,"unequal to the task of killing his rival, flung himself off a mountain."
5591,THE RABBIT,
5592,THE RABBIT,"What would be the use of that—he would die, and then he might as well"
5593,THE RABBIT,"not have lived. He thought of all the great people he had read of, or"
5594,THE RABBIT,"had heard of, or had known. There was Jean the blacksmith, who had lost"
5595,THE RABBIT,an eye saving his child from a horse. If he lost an eye Addie would not
5596,THE RABBIT,like him.
5597,THE RABBIT,
5598,THE RABBIT,"Napoleon—there was a well-known man; he had done so many things, it"
5599,THE RABBIT,"seemed, for which people framed him in white enamel and hung him upon"
5600,THE RABBIT,their bedroom walls; but chiefly he had been renowned for his killing.
5601,THE RABBIT,Rugo thought about that awhile and came to the illuminating conclusion
5602,THE RABBIT,that all heroes were men who killed or were killed.
5603,THE RABBIT,
5604,THE RABBIT,"Well, the last was impossible; if he was killed he might just as well"
5605,THE RABBIT,"have starved in the country and not have laid eyes on Addie. Therefore,"
5606,THE RABBIT,he must kill—but what—but whom?
5607,THE RABBIT,
5608,THE RABBIT,"Of course, he might save something or somebody, but they would have to"
5609,THE RABBIT,"be in danger first, and there might not be any danger for days and days,"
5610,THE RABBIT,and he was tired of waiting.
5611,THE RABBIT,
5612,THE RABBIT,"Presently he laid his work aside, lowered the shade, and, lying face"
5613,THE RABBIT,"down on his bed, he tried to think it all out clearly."
5614,THE RABBIT,
5615,THE RABBIT,Presently he got a vivid picture of killing in his mind. He sat up and
5616,THE RABBIT,put his hands two or three times over his face. It was damp. He sat on
5617,THE RABBIT,the edge of the bed and looked at the carpet. His mind wandered. He
5618,THE RABBIT,"thought of the ducks he had longed to stroke, of the gentle, feeding"
5619,THE RABBIT,"cows, of the fresh, clean air—then he thought again of Addie and of what"
5620,THE RABBIT,he must do. He tried to picture himself killing someone. He put his two
5621,THE RABBIT,"hands together and looked at them—there, that was the way. Then he"
5622,THE RABBIT,"smiled. His hands, set as they were, could not have choked anything"
5623,THE RABBIT,"larger than a thrush. He widened them, but he separated them instantly"
5624,THE RABBIT,"and rubbed them down his legs, breathing heavily. What a terrible"
5625,THE RABBIT,business a hero’s was! He thought of the throbbing that must stop
5626,THE RABBIT,"beneath such hands as his. He got up, shaking his shoulders from side to"
5627,THE RABBIT,side as if his back hurt him. He pulled up the shade.
5628,THE RABBIT,
5629,THE RABBIT,The butcher’s windows opposite attracted his attention. Two gas lights
5630,THE RABBIT,were burning there vividly. Rugo could see flanks of beef laid out in
5631,THE RABBIT,"pans, little ruddy pools collecting about them like insertion. Fowl hung"
5632,THE RABBIT,by the necks and several hams lured the passer-by as they swung softly
5633,THE RABBIT,this way and that.
5634,THE RABBIT,
5635,THE RABBIT,He opened his door hesitatingly and shutting it carefully stepped out
5636,THE RABBIT,into the roadway.
5637,THE RABBIT,
5638,THE RABBIT,He crossed over and leaned his head against the glass. He looked in very
5639,THE RABBIT,"close now, and he could see the film that shrouded the dead eyes of the"
5640,THE RABBIT,"fowl and the hares. Slabs of liver laid out in heaps, flanked by cuts of"
5641,THE RABBIT,"tripe, drew his attention."
5642,THE RABBIT,
5643,THE RABBIT,A strange sensation had hold of him in the pit of his stomach. It seemed
5644,THE RABBIT,to him that he was turning pale. He raised his hand to his beard and
5645,THE RABBIT,tugged at it.
5646,THE RABBIT,
5647,THE RABBIT,Two or three red hairs separated and came out. He held them up between
5648,THE RABBIT,him and the light. Then he darted in the back door of the shop.
5649,THE RABBIT,
5650,THE RABBIT,Presently he emerged carrying a box. With the furtive and hurried step
5651,THE RABBIT,of a man who is being observed he crossed the street. He opened the door
5652,THE RABBIT,"of his own little shop and, locking it quickly, he put the box in the"
5653,THE RABBIT,corner and turned down the light.
5654,THE RABBIT,
5655,THE RABBIT,It was very dark and he stumbled. A little reflection came from the meat
5656,THE RABBIT,"shop window and touched the rims of his cardboards, and his pattern book"
5657,THE RABBIT,full of the funny strutting gentlemen. His heart was beating horribly
5658,THE RABBIT,against his side. He began to question himself and stopped. He could
5659,THE RABBIT,never do it unless he made his mind a resolute thing. He clenched his
5660,THE RABBIT,"teeth, blinking his eyes as he did so. He began to shiver."
5661,THE RABBIT,
5662,THE RABBIT,"Presently he threw himself on the ground in the corner near the box, his"
5663,THE RABBIT,"arms over his head, his face flat upon the dust and grime of the boards."
5664,THE RABBIT,He must do it quickly—but he couldn’t do it.
5665,THE RABBIT,
5666,THE RABBIT,"His mind began to wander again. He thought of the road, red and yellow"
5667,THE RABBIT,"with the dying leaves of Autumn, of the great swaying shadows and the"
5668,THE RABBIT,sunlight breaking in between in little jagged spots like flowers. He
5669,THE RABBIT,"remembered the mosquitoes, and he got to his knees and let his hands"
5670,THE RABBIT,hang down at his sides.
5671,THE RABBIT,
5672,THE RABBIT,The Summer had always been so pretty; the rains left the fields so
5673,THE RABBIT,bright and sudden when they came into view over the top of the hill. The
5674,THE RABBIT,"ploughing had been good, he had really enjoyed that after all, only then"
5675,THE RABBIT,he had not known just how much he did enjoy it. What a pity that he had
5676,THE RABBIT,not known what a good thing it all was then.
5677,THE RABBIT,
5678,THE RABBIT,"Something moved beside him, breathing softly. He uttered a sharp cry and"
5679,THE RABBIT,"the same thing moved back, hitting a board, and was again silent."
5680,THE RABBIT,
5681,THE RABBIT,"He bent forward, thrust his two hands out, closed them—tighter, tighter"
5682,THE RABBIT,"and tighter. A faint cry, a little jerking to and fro—that was all."
5683,THE RABBIT,
5684,THE RABBIT,He stood up and turned the light on. He looked at his hands. Then
5685,THE RABBIT,"backing away from the corner, never letting his eyes rest there, he"
5686,THE RABBIT,plunged his hands up to the elbows in a pail of water. He threw a cupful
5687,THE RABBIT,of it inside his shirt at the neck. He opened the door. Addie was there.
5688,THE RABBIT,
5689,THE RABBIT,"She came in softly, gently, insinuatingly. She could see by his face"
5690,THE RABBIT,that something very horrible and necessary had been done. She saw by his
5691,THE RABBIT,"face how it had hurt, by his hands what it must have cost him."
5692,THE RABBIT,
5693,THE RABBIT,"She came close to him. “What have you done, Rugo?” she said."
5694,THE RABBIT,
5695,THE RABBIT,"“I—I have killed,” he said, almost in a whisper."
5696,THE RABBIT,
5697,THE RABBIT,“What—where?” She moved toward the centre of the room and then looked
5698,THE RABBIT,into the corner.
5699,THE RABBIT,
5700,THE RABBIT,“That?” she began to laugh.
5701,THE RABBIT,
5702,THE RABBIT,"“Take it or leave it,” he said suddenly in a loud and penetrating voice."
5703,THE RABBIT,
5704,THE RABBIT,She stooped and lifted it up—a small grey rabbit.
5705,THE RABBIT,
5706,THE RABBIT,She laid it down again. She placed her arm about him.
5707,THE RABBIT,
5708,THE RABBIT,"“Come quickly,” she said. “Comb your hair.”"
5709,THE RABBIT,
5710,THE RABBIT,"She pushed him into the street. She was afraid of him, for there was"
5711,THE RABBIT,something strange and hard in his mouth and he walked putting each foot
5712,THE RABBIT,down very flat and steady.
5713,THE RABBIT,
5714,THE RABBIT,“Where are you going? What are you going to do?” He did not seem to know
5715,THE RABBIT,"that she was there, clinging to him, her arm about his waist. He had"
5716,THE RABBIT,"forgotten her. He looked up into the air, sniffing it and smiling."
5717,THE RABBIT,
5718,THE RABBIT,"“Come,” she said, “we are going to have your boots shined.”"

5741,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5742,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,The days had been very warm and quick. It was Fall now and everything
5743,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"was drawing to a close. It had been a bad, but somehow pleasant, year. A"
5744,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,great number of people had been disillusioned and were not seen hurrying
5745,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"from one place to another, as is customary with those of undisturbed"
5746,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"habit. They went slowly, and it was said that Winter with its snow and"
5747,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,frost would be most welcome.
5748,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5749,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,Carmen la Tosca was in the habit of riding at a swift gallop down the
5750,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,lane and into the copse beyond. She leaned ever so little in her saddle
5751,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,as she went under the boughs. The plume of her hat bent and swung
5752,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,smartly back into place as she rounded the curve.
5753,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5754,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"Her horse was a clear cascade of white. The shining forelock, the soft"
5755,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,descending plane of the frontal bone melted into a taut nostril. And
5756,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"where Carmen la Tosca broke the living line of its back with her own,"
5757,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"the spine flowed beneath her as deftly as water, and quivered into"
5758,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"massive alert haunches, which in turn socketed in velvet, a foaming"
5759,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,length of tail.
5760,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5761,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,Carmen la Tosca rode well. She let more than usual of her pelvis drop
5762,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,into the saddle. Upon the reins she kept gloved hands in a grip that was
5763,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,consciously lacking in direction.
5764,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5765,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,Carmen la Tosca was an actress. She had played in “Fife and Fiddle” and
5766,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“Drums of the King.”
5767,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5768,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,She took parts suggesting a love of danger and intrigue. She was always
5769,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"handsomely gloved and shod, and her dresses were widely copied."
5770,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5771,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"She had been in stock, and in the beginning had sung in opera; she had"
5772,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,been the Queen in “Aïda” and she had played a boy’s part in vaudeville.
5773,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,Now she was resting.
5774,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5775,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,She was not the kind of woman who usually came to this quiet country
5776,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"town, snuggled, as they say, among the foothills. The boy who kept the"
5777,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,general store said she was “stunning.” Little children ran backward
5778,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"ahead of her, crying provokingly, “Red lips, red lips!” But no one"
5779,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,really knew her.
5780,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5781,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,She had appeared in the Spring of the year with a man-servant and a
5782,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,maid. For two days she had been seen at the windows hanging curtains.
5783,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,When they were all hung no one saw her for some time. Then she bought a
5784,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,white horse and rode it. And after that she always rode on the white
5785,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"horse, though she had six or seven others before the Fall came. Usually"
5786,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"she rode alone. Now and again a gentleman, with a birth-mark twisting"
5787,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"his face into an unwilling irony, rode beside her. There was a goat path"
5788,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,in the underbrush and here two boys sometimes came and lay and talked of
5789,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"her and waited for her to pass, riding that smart way on the white mare."
5790,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"These boys were Brandt and Bailey Wilson, a farmer’s sons. Sometimes"
5791,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"couples, going berrying by the mountain road, came near enough to hear"
5792,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,her laughing behind the casement.
5793,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5794,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"Sometimes she walked, descending the hill carefully, avoiding the melon"
5795,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"plants, talking brightly to a young man, but paying little attention to"
5796,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"the effect of her words, not through vanity, but simply through lack of"
5797,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,interest in the effect itself.
5798,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5799,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,There was a great deal of gossip about her of course. She did not court
5800,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"mystery, but it was all about her."
5801,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5802,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"People said that she was not exactly beautiful, neither was she ugly."
5803,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,Her face held the elements of both in perfect control. She was brutally
5804,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,chic.
5805,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5806,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"A lean, tall woman of the village, who had come from London, said Carmen"
5807,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,la Tosca’s back was like the Queen’s. This was probably an exaggeration.
5808,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5809,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,Carmen la Tosca breakfasted in bed and late. She dusted her arms with
5810,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,talc and she languidly settled into a light lace peignoir. She had tea
5811,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"and rolls, and the bed stood between two unvarnished cherry-wood ovals,"
5812,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,in which were imprisoned two engravings of officials of the Tower of
5813,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"London, in its bloodiest hour."
5814,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5815,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,The double windows faced the orchard. She turned her back to the orchard
5816,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"and its falling apples, and read St. Francis, or the morning paper which"
5817,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"was, by the time she received it, a day or two old."
5818,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5819,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,The room was bare and grey and rustic. And in this Carmen la Tosca and
5820,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,her bed made a strange contrast. She liked to think of it unless she had
5821,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,other things on her mind. If the morning was chilly she had a quilted
5822,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"jacket, and if it was raining she had the shades raised that she might"
5823,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,watch the rain falling a long way.
5824,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5825,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"Early in the morning the boy chose it had been raining, but about eleven"
5826,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,it had stopped and the sun was trying to come out. Carmen la Tosca could
5827,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,smell how wet everything was.
5828,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5829,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"The boy was Brandt Wilson, fourteen; he had done rather well at the high"
5830,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,school of the nearest large town. He was short and his head was large
5831,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,and his face already a little prematurely softened by melancholy. He was
5832,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,splashed with mud and his red tie stuck out ridiculously at the top of a
5833,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"vest that was too large for his small, shyly muscular chest."
5834,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5835,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"He stood before her on the rug, his hat in his hand."
5836,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5837,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"Carmen la Tosca, with a single movement, rolled over in bed."
5838,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5839,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“Who are you? Where did you come from?”
5840,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5841,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“I am Brandt Wilson. I came through the window. It was very easy.”
5842,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5843,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“Well,” she said. “What is it?”"
5844,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5845,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"The child hesitated, and with a look of distress, managed to say:"
5846,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5847,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“I have a brother.”
5848,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5849,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"Carmen la Tosca pushed away the paper and regarded him with amusement,"
5850,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,and a little amazement.
5851,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5852,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“He is two years older than I am—and there’s something I don’t
5853,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,understand—and you know everything.”
5854,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5855,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“Who said so?”
5856,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5857,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“The neighbours, my father, my mother, my sister, the schoolmaster, the"
5858,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,postman——”
5859,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5860,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“That will do.”
5861,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5862,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“You are a woman of the world.” The childish sound of his voice became
5863,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,terribly apparent.
5864,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5865,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“My brother is where no one understands—My sister said, ‘I don’t like"
5866,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"Bailey any more, he has lost that cunning little light in his eyes’—and"
5867,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"I said, ‘It’s still there when you give him something he likes, and he"
5868,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"is untying it, with his head bent down——’”"
5869,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5870,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“How do you come to think of all this?”
5871,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5872,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“Once the sun was shining and we had been lying out on the bank with our
5873,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"arms under our heads and then he said—he confessed”—the child faltered,"
5874,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"then looking at her directly and fixedly, said, “Bailey cried when he"
5875,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,knew it was over——”
5876,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5877,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“What was over?”
5878,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5879,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“I asked him, and he answered, ‘I am a man now.’ Shall I cry, too, when"
5880,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,I know that? What is it all about?”
5881,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5882,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,Carmen la Tosca rose on her elbow and looked at him with suffused eyes
5883,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"as if she had been crying, but it was all an illusion."
5884,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5885,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“How many of you are there?”
5886,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5887,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“Three. A married brother.”
5888,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5889,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“And how old is he?”
5890,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5891,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“Twenty-four. He cried once, too, but differently, about his sweetheart."
5892,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"She died, you know, and when they told him he said, crying out, ‘I could"
5893,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"have saved her.’ We asked him how, but he would not tell us, but he told"
5894,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"mother; he said, ‘I would have said I love you.’ Is there such a power?”"
5895,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5896,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"Carmen la Tosca lay on her back, her hands beside her."
5897,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5898,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“That was innocence. We are all waiting for the day when people shall
5899,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"learn of our innocence, all over again,” she said brightly."
5900,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5901,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“And is that suffering?”
5902,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5903,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“Yes, a special kind, for everyone,” she said gravely. “But not a"
5904,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,personal torment. You are not to believe in that. Suffering is all
5905,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"alike, yours, mine, everybody’s. All these distinctions and what people"
5906,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,say about them is nonsense. Suffering is all the same everywhere for
5907,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"everyone.” She suddenly rose up in bed and said, softly, “Now you do not"
5908,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,want to talk to me any more?”
5909,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5910,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,He moved his fingers on the foot-board of the bed.
5911,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5912,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“I’m sorry,” she said hastily, covered with confusion. “It’s my"
5913,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,indolence that does it.”
5914,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5915,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“What?” he asked timidly.
5916,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5917,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“Embarrasses you.”
5918,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5919,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“It’s all right.”
5920,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5921,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“Now see here,” she continued. “Do you ever think of animals?”"
5922,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5923,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“Why?”
5924,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5925,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“Do you?”
5926,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5927,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“I don’t know. I notice them——”
5928,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5929,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“Capital!” she cried, clapping her hands; “that’s what I wanted to know."
5930,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"Well then, what would all this, you and I and your great trouble, mean"
5931,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,to them?”
5932,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5933,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“I don’t know what you mean.”
5934,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5935,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“Your questions, my answers? Nothing.”"
5936,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5937,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"He coloured, and looked down. “What does it mean?” he repeated, and as"
5938,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"he said it he could not remember what he had come for, or what he had"
5939,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"said, and while she was answering he tried desperately to re-establish"
5940,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,himself.
5941,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5942,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"He said, “And you do not know what I must go through before I feel like"
5943,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,Bailey?”
5944,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5945,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“A little evil day by day, that makes everything grow.”"
5946,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5947,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“Yes, that is what I wanted to know,” he said, breathlessly."
5948,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5949,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“Listen then, it’s all that makes the difference between a gentleman and"
5950,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"a fool. Never do evil to good people, they always forgive it, and that"
5951,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,is nasty.”
5952,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5953,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“But what about all these things that people talk of and I do not
5954,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,understand?”
5955,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5956,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“The simple story, simply told by simple people—that in the end is all"
5957,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,you will listen to.”
5958,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5959,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“And I’m not to try to make anything out of all this?”
5960,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5961,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“No,” she said, “nothing at all, leave it alone.”"
5962,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5963,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“And not to try to understand what made him cry?”
5964,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5965,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“Just as it is. The calf is born, she lies in the sun; she waits for the"
5966,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,end. That is dignity.”
5967,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5968,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“But sometimes I’m unhappy.”
5969,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5970,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“In the end you will know you know nothing. That will be the death of
5971,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,you.”
5972,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5973,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"Brandt stood still, though she had taken up her paper."
5974,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5975,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,“Just that?”
5976,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5977,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"“Come here,” she said, and he came, quickly. She put her hand out with a"
5978,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,"gentle laugh and touched him. “There, that’s all.”"
5979,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,
5980,A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY,He went away then.
