573,A REPRISAL,"Sleep, that makes all things whole,"
574,A REPRISAL,Indulged my tortured soul.
575,A REPRISAL,In the jewel-chest of dreams
576,A REPRISAL,"He stirred the elusive gleams,"
577,A REPRISAL,"And found the gift of power,"
578,A REPRISAL,"Round, pure, and perfect power,"
579,A REPRISAL,And laid it in my hand.
580,A REPRISAL,
581,A REPRISAL,I said: “I have command

583,A REPRISAL,His own wings will I wear!
584,A REPRISAL,I will soar as a great hell-kite

605,A REPRISAL,"I cried with a great voice,"
606,A REPRISAL,To mine enemy I cried:
607,A REPRISAL,"“Come forth, come forth, to hear!"
608,A REPRISAL,"Look up, look up, to see!"
609,A REPRISAL,"Lo, what is in my choice!"
610,A REPRISAL,"This deed of black disgrace,"
611,A REPRISAL,This have you done to me;
612,A REPRISAL,This might I do to you;
613,A REPRISAL,"Yet this I would not do,"
614,A REPRISAL,"Yea, this I could not do!"
615,A REPRISAL,Let the knowledge smite your pride
616,A REPRISAL,Like a gauntlet in the face!”

618,A REPRISAL,Mine enemy stood in his gate:
619,A REPRISAL,He was sadder than I had thought.
620,A REPRISAL,"I hated what he had wrought,"
621,A REPRISAL,But him I could not hate.
622,A REPRISAL,His eyes were startled wide.
623,A REPRISAL,What would he have replied?
624,A REPRISAL,"I know not. Ere he spoke,"
625,A REPRISAL,The merciless morning broke.
626,A REPRISAL,Hawkers in sunny streets
627,A REPRISAL,"Shrilled triumphs and defeats,"

1354,THE GRAY VICTORY,Is in her memory? What struggle of sailors
1355,THE GRAY VICTORY,"In wild cold waves, at night?"
1356,THE GRAY VICTORY,
1357,THE GRAY VICTORY,With head thrown back
1358,THE GRAY VICTORY,She looks upon the sea.
1359,THE GRAY VICTORY,In every large curve of her broken body
1360,THE GRAY VICTORY,"Is trust, is triumph."
1361,THE GRAY VICTORY,"Against the sky she rises,"
1362,THE GRAY VICTORY,"The light-filled, pure, ineffable azure sky;"
1363,THE GRAY VICTORY,"Serene, unshaken,"
1364,THE GRAY VICTORY,Rises the Victory.
1365,THE GRAY VICTORY,
1366,THE GRAY VICTORY,
1367,THE GRAY VICTORY,
1368,THE GRAY VICTORY,
1369,FLAGS AND THE SKY,FLAGS AND THE SKY
1370,FLAGS AND THE SKY,
1371,FLAGS AND THE SKY,
1372,FLAGS AND THE SKY,I looked from my window:
1373,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"I heard a whisper without from the rippling poplar,"
1374,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"I heard the wash of the river, its waves are never still;"
1375,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"I looked, and over the water the flag,"
1376,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"Alive as the river, alive as the rippling poplar,"
1377,FLAGS AND THE SKY,Rippled too in the wind.
1378,FLAGS AND THE SKY,The sun was upon it.
1379,FLAGS AND THE SKY,It had the beauty of flowers.
1380,FLAGS AND THE SKY,
1381,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"O flag, though you were not my own, I know I should love you:"
1382,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"I love all flowers, all flags:"
1383,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"Their colors in the wind flowing, in the sun brightening:"
1384,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"Deep blue of the night sky, or the splendor of flame,"
1385,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"Or green of spring, or the daring imperious scarlet,"
1386,FLAGS AND THE SKY,The color of men’s blood:
1387,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"Their curious blazonry I love, heraldic, historic,"
1388,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"Leopard or eagle, stripe or star or raying sun,"
1389,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"Or the Cross of St. George and the Cross of St. Andrew,"
1390,FLAGS AND THE SKY,Or whatsoever sign men have loved and followed.
1391,FLAGS AND THE SKY,
1392,FLAGS AND THE SKY,For surely a flag has a soul.
1393,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"It is a thing sacred as sunrise,"
1394,FLAGS AND THE SKY,It is sacred as the stars.
1395,FLAGS AND THE SKY,The spirit of Man lifts it up into the sky
1396,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"That holds all stars, all flags."
1397,FLAGS AND THE SKY,
1398,FLAGS AND THE SKY,I believe that a flag cannot be dishonored forever
1399,FLAGS AND THE SKY,By any deed of men.
1400,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"Let it but fly awhile, and the wind will winnow it,"
1401,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"And the fierce pure sun will purge it, will wash it clean;"
1402,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"For the souls of races and nations live in the sky,"
1403,FLAGS AND THE SKY,And are forever better than the deeds men do.
1404,FLAGS AND THE SKY,
1405,FLAGS AND THE SKY,There was a man who burned with fire
1406,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"The flag that he loved best,"
1407,FLAGS AND THE SKY,Because he thought that out of its dead ashes
1408,FLAGS AND THE SKY,Might rise the Flag of Man.
1409,FLAGS AND THE SKY,
1410,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"He would have to wait a long time for that rising,"
1411,FLAGS AND THE SKY,He would have to wait forever;
1412,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"For live things do not rise out of ashes,"
1413,FLAGS AND THE SKY,They rise out of live loves.
1414,FLAGS AND THE SKY,
1415,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"That man never knew that his flag had a soul,"
1416,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"He never knew that the world needed the soul in his flag,"
1417,FLAGS AND THE SKY,And the souls in all flags.
1418,FLAGS AND THE SKY,
1419,FLAGS AND THE SKY,The Flag of Man!
1420,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"What should be its colors, in the wind flowing, in the sun"
1421,FLAGS AND THE SKY,brightening?
1422,FLAGS AND THE SKY,And what should be its curious blazonry?
1423,FLAGS AND THE SKY,
1424,FLAGS AND THE SKY,The upper field should be blue as the sky of God:
1425,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"The lower field, should be red as the blood of Man:"
1426,FLAGS AND THE SKY,And there should fly forever beside it--
1427,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"Always beside it, and neither above nor below it--"
1428,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"The one flag that a man is born to,"
1429,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"Born of his mother to love and not to leave,"
1430,FLAGS AND THE SKY,As he loves his mother and will not leave her.
1431,FLAGS AND THE SKY,
1432,FLAGS AND THE SKY,The Flag of Man!
1433,FLAGS AND THE SKY,It is long a-weaving.
1434,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"God speed the weaving, and Man speed the weaving!"
1435,FLAGS AND THE SKY,Let every one of us go on weaving that flag in his heart;
1436,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"Perhaps, when the grass is rippling over the grave of him,"
1437,FLAGS AND THE SKY,"It may ripple in the sky that holds all stars, all flags,"
1438,FLAGS AND THE SKY,The Flag of All Souls.
