479,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Out of the doorway they saw her start,"
480,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"(Pickett’s Virginians were marching through,)"
481,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,The hot little foolish hero-heart
482,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,Armoured with stars and the sacred blue.
483,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,Clutching the folds of red and white
484,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Stood she and bearded those ranks of theirs,"
485,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Shouting shrilly with all her might,"
486,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"“Come and take it, the man that dares!”"
487,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,
488,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,Pickett’s Virginians were passing through;
489,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Supple as steel and brown as leather,"
490,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Rusty and dusty of hat and shoe,"
491,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,Wonted to hunger and war and weather;
492,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Peerless, fearless, an army’s flower!"
493,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Sterner soldiers the world saw never,"
494,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Marching lightly, that summer hour,"
495,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,To death and failure and fame forever.
496,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,
497,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,Rose from the rippling ranks a cheer;
498,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Pickett saluted, with bold eyes beaming,"
499,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Sweeping his cap like a cavalier,"
500,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,With his lion locks in the warm wind streaming.
501,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Fierce little Jenny! her courage fell,"
502,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"As the firm lines flickered with friendly laughter,"
503,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,And Greencastle streets gave back the yell
504,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,That Gettysburg slopes gave back soon after.
505,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,
506,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,So they cheered for the flag they fought

508,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Loving the brave as the brave man ought,"
509,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,And never a finger was raised to fright her:
510,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"So they marched, though they knew it not,"
511,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Through the fresh green June to the shock infernal,"
512,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"To the hell of the shell and the plunging shot,"
513,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,And the charge that has won them a name eternal.
514,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,
515,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"And she felt at last, as she hid her face,"
516,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,There had lain at the root of her childish daring
517,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"A trust in the men of her own brave race,"
518,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,And a secret faith in the foe’s forbearing.
519,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"And she sobbed, till the roll of the rumbling gun"
520,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,And the swinging tramp of the marching men
521,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,"Were a memory only, and day was done,"
522,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,And the stars in the fold of the blue again.
523,A BALLAD OF ’SIXTY-THREE,

551,A BALLAD OF ’NINETY-EIGHT,
552,A BALLAD OF ’NINETY-EIGHT,“You saw me writhe at the side of the trench:

606,THE HOUSE OF HATE,"And the name thereof I set in the stone-work over the gate,"
607,THE HOUSE OF HATE,With a carving of bats and apes; and I called it the House of Hate.
608,THE HOUSE OF HATE,
609,THE HOUSE OF HATE,And the front was alive with masks of malice and of despair;
610,THE HOUSE OF HATE,"Horned demons that leered in stone, and women with serpent hair;"

628,THE HOUSE OF HATE,"And I ordered my board for feast; and I drank, in the topmost seat,"

645,THE HOUSE OF HATE,"And at morn, when the House of Hate was a ruin, despoiled of flame,"

857,THE FIRST GUEST,He has both key and claim.
858,THE FIRST GUEST,

863,THE FIRST GUEST,"Ah, not for ends malign,"
864,THE FIRST GUEST,"Like wild thing crouched in lair,"
865,THE FIRST GUEST,"Or watcher of a snare,"
866,THE FIRST GUEST,But with a friend’s design

870,THE FIRST GUEST,"To welcome any other,"

872,THE FIRST GUEST,But still his hour awaits
873,THE FIRST GUEST,Each several guest to find
874,THE FIRST GUEST,"Alone, yea, quite alone;"
875,THE FIRST GUEST,Pacing with pensive mind
876,THE FIRST GUEST,"The cloister’s echoing stone,"

879,THE FIRST GUEST,"’Tis truth, though we forget,"
880,THE FIRST GUEST,In Life’s House enters none
881,THE FIRST GUEST,"Who shall that seeker shun,"
882,THE FIRST GUEST,Who shall not so be met.
883,THE FIRST GUEST,“Is this mine hour?” each saith.
884,THE FIRST GUEST,"“So be it, gentle Death!”"
885,THE FIRST GUEST,"Each has his way to end,"
886,THE FIRST GUEST,Encountering this friend.
887,THE FIRST GUEST,Griefs die to memories mild;
888,THE FIRST GUEST,Hope turns a weanèd child;
889,THE FIRST GUEST,"Love shines a spirit white,"
890,THE FIRST GUEST,With eyes of deepened light.
891,THE FIRST GUEST,"When many a guest has passed,"
892,THE FIRST GUEST,Some day ’tis Life’s at last
893,THE FIRST GUEST,To front the face of Death.
894,THE FIRST GUEST,"Then, casements closed, men say:"
895,THE FIRST GUEST,“Lord Life is gone away;
896,THE FIRST GUEST,"He went, we trust and pray,"
897,THE FIRST GUEST,"To God, who gave him breath.”"
898,THE FIRST GUEST,"Beginning, End, He is:"
899,THE FIRST GUEST,Are not these sons both His?
900,THE FIRST GUEST,"Lo, these with Him are one!"

1217,VII,
1218,VII,"Yet kneeled the youth bewildered, for the stroke"

1238,VIII,And forth he fared along the broad bright way;
1239,VIII,"And mild was the young sun, and wild the breeze,"
1240,VIII,That seemed to blow to lands no eye had seen;
1241,VIII,And Pentecost had kindled all the trees
1242,VIII,"To tremulous thin whispering flames of green,"
1243,VIII,And given to each a sacred word to say;

1256,VIII,"Till, last, the fluctuant wood the flash did whelm,"

1296,THE ENCOUNTER,"There’s a wood-way winding high,"
1297,THE ENCOUNTER,"Roofed far up with light-green flicker,"
1298,THE ENCOUNTER,Save one midmost star of sky.
1299,THE ENCOUNTER,Underfoot ’tis all pale brown
1300,THE ENCOUNTER,With the dead leaves matted down
1301,THE ENCOUNTER,"One on other, thick and thicker;"
1302,THE ENCOUNTER,"Soft, but springing to the tread."
1303,THE ENCOUNTER,There a youth late met a maid
1304,THE ENCOUNTER,"Running lightly,--oh, so fleetly!"
1305,THE ENCOUNTER,“Whence art thou?” the herd-boy said.
1306,THE ENCOUNTER,"Either side her long hair swayed,"
1307,THE ENCOUNTER,"Half a tress and half a braid,"
1308,THE ENCOUNTER,Coloured like the soft dead leaf.
1309,THE ENCOUNTER,"As she answered, laughing sweetly,"
1310,THE ENCOUNTER,"On she ran, as flies the swallow;"
1311,THE ENCOUNTER,He could not choose but follow
1312,THE ENCOUNTER,Though it had been to his grief.
1313,THE ENCOUNTER,
1314,THE ENCOUNTER,"“I have come up from the valley,--"
1315,THE ENCOUNTER,"From the valley!” Once he caught her,"
1316,THE ENCOUNTER,"Swerving down a sidelong alley,"
1317,THE ENCOUNTER,"For a moment, by the hand."
1318,THE ENCOUNTER,"“Tell me, tell me,” he besought her,"
1319,THE ENCOUNTER,"“Sweetest, I would understand"
1320,THE ENCOUNTER,"Why so cold thy palm, that slips"
1321,THE ENCOUNTER,From me like the shy cold minnow?
1322,THE ENCOUNTER,"The wood is warm, and smells of fern,"
1323,THE ENCOUNTER,And below the meadows burn.
1324,THE ENCOUNTER,"Hard to catch and hard to win, oh!"
1325,THE ENCOUNTER,Why are those brown finger tips
1326,THE ENCOUNTER,Crinkled as with lines of water?”
1327,THE ENCOUNTER,
1328,THE ENCOUNTER,"Laughing while she featly footed,"
1329,THE ENCOUNTER,"With the herd-boy hasting after,"
1330,THE ENCOUNTER,"Sprang she on a trunk uprooted,"
1331,THE ENCOUNTER,Clung she by a roping vine;
1332,THE ENCOUNTER,"Leaped behind a birch, and told,"
1333,THE ENCOUNTER,"Still eluding, through its fine,"
1334,THE ENCOUNTER,"Mocking, slender, leafy laughter,"
1335,THE ENCOUNTER,Why her finger tips were cold:
1336,THE ENCOUNTER,
1337,THE ENCOUNTER,"“I went down to tease the brook,"
1338,THE ENCOUNTER,"With her fishes, there below;"
1339,THE ENCOUNTER,"She comes dancing, thou must know,"
1340,THE ENCOUNTER,And the bushes arch above her;
1341,THE ENCOUNTER,"But the seeking sunbeams look,"
1342,THE ENCOUNTER,"Dodging, through the wind-blown cover,"
1343,THE ENCOUNTER,Find and kiss her into stars.
1344,THE ENCOUNTER,Silvery veins entwine and crook
1345,THE ENCOUNTER,Where a stone her tripping bars;
1346,THE ENCOUNTER,"There be smooth, clear sweeps, and swirls"
1347,THE ENCOUNTER,Bubbling up crisp drops like pearls.
1348,THE ENCOUNTER,"There I lie, along the rocks"
1349,THE ENCOUNTER,"Thick with greenest slippery moss,"
1350,THE ENCOUNTER,And I have in hand a strip
1351,THE ENCOUNTER,"Of gray, pliant, dappled bark;"
1352,THE ENCOUNTER,And I comb her liquid locks
1353,THE ENCOUNTER,Till her tangling currents cross;
1354,THE ENCOUNTER,And I have delight to hark
1355,THE ENCOUNTER,"To the chiding of her lip,"
1356,THE ENCOUNTER,Taking on the talking stone
1357,THE ENCOUNTER,With each turn another tone.
1358,THE ENCOUNTER,"Oh, to set her wavelets bickering!"
1359,THE ENCOUNTER,"Oh, to hear her laughter simple,"
1360,THE ENCOUNTER,See her fret and flash and dimple!
1361,THE ENCOUNTER,"Ha, ha, ha!” The woodland rang"
1362,THE ENCOUNTER,With the rippling through the flickering.
1363,THE ENCOUNTER,At the birch the herd-boy sprang.
1364,THE ENCOUNTER,
1365,THE ENCOUNTER,On a sudden something wound
1366,THE ENCOUNTER,Vine-like round his throbbing throat;
1367,THE ENCOUNTER,On a sudden something smote
1368,THE ENCOUNTER,"Sharply on his longing lips,"
1369,THE ENCOUNTER,Stung him as the birch bough whips:
1370,THE ENCOUNTER,Was it kiss or was it blow?
1371,THE ENCOUNTER,Never after could he know;
1372,THE ENCOUNTER,She was gone without a sound.
1373,THE ENCOUNTER,
1374,THE ENCOUNTER,Never after could he see
1375,THE ENCOUNTER,"In the wood or in the mead,"
1376,THE ENCOUNTER,Or in any company
1377,THE ENCOUNTER,"Of the rustic mortal maids,"
1378,THE ENCOUNTER,Her with acorn-coloured braids;
1379,THE ENCOUNTER,Never came she to his need.
1380,THE ENCOUNTER,"Never more the lad was merry,"
1381,THE ENCOUNTER,"Strayed apart, and learned to dream,"
1382,THE ENCOUNTER,Feeding on the tart wild berry;
1383,THE ENCOUNTER,"Murmuring words none understood,--"

1385,THE ENCOUNTER,And with music of the stream.

1918,FIAMMETTA,"“Declare, ye circled shades, your home on earth!"

1934,FIAMMETTA,Then did appear
1935,FIAMMETTA,"Her set smile’s irony, and I discerned"
1936,FIAMMETTA,"Through those her long dark languid eyes, right clear"
1937,FIAMMETTA,How far below her soul forever burned.
1938,FIAMMETTA,Her sleeves of scarlet hung in many a shred;
1939,FIAMMETTA,"Her silver chains were all to tarnish turned,"
1940,FIAMMETTA,And crisped were the laurels on her head.
1941,FIAMMETTA,"“Alas! why camest thou to this place of pain,--"

1958,FIAMMETTA,To our own dear delights we turned away;
1959,FIAMMETTA,"Forgot the city full of tears, forgot"

1969,FIAMMETTA,"For aye! Yet not so far, I deem, this den"
1970,FIAMMETTA,From sound of suffering as our fields of flowers.”
1971,FIAMMETTA,"With that weird smile, she turned as if to go."
1972,FIAMMETTA,"Loud groaned the lurid City, the sullen fen"
1973,FIAMMETTA,"Of Styx, and all that grief that lies below."
1974,FIAMMETTA,"“Farewell,” I sighed, “Fiammetta!” But she, “Not so!"

2158,THE KING’S DIAMOND,"Ah, what if Heaven no end will grant,"
2159,THE KING’S DIAMOND,"Resolved in any heats of wrath,"
2160,THE KING’S DIAMOND,To that which for its symbol hath
2161,THE KING’S DIAMOND,The unsubduable adamant?
2162,THE KING’S DIAMOND,"Ah, what if like a falling jewel"
2163,THE KING’S DIAMOND,"The soul whose light was mocking-cruel,"

2496,TRIUMPH,"In the blown wood, whence breaks the wild white stream"
2497,TRIUMPH,"Rushing and flashing, glorying in its gain;"
2498,TRIUMPH,"Nor swerves nor parts, but with a swift disdain"
2499,TRIUMPH,"O’erleaps the boulders lying in long dream,"
2500,TRIUMPH,Lapped in cold moss; and in its joy doth seem
2501,TRIUMPH,A wood-born creature bursting from a chain.
2502,TRIUMPH,
2503,TRIUMPH,"And “Triumph, triumph, triumph!” is its hoarse"
2504,TRIUMPH,"Fierce-whispered word. O fond, and dost not know"
2505,TRIUMPH,"Thy triumph on another wise must be,--"
2506,TRIUMPH,"To render all the tribute of thy force,"
2507,TRIUMPH,And lose thy little being in the flow
2508,TRIUMPH,Of the unvaunting river toward the sea!
2509,TRIUMPH,
2510,TRIUMPH,
2511,A MYSTERY,A MYSTERY
2512,A MYSTERY,
2513,A MYSTERY,That sunless day no living shadow swept
2514,A MYSTERY,"Across the hills, fleet shadow chasing light,"
2515,A MYSTERY,"Twin of the sailing cloud: but mists wool-white,"
2516,A MYSTERY,"Slow-stealing mists, on those heaved shoulders crept,"
2517,A MYSTERY,And wrought about the strong hills while they slept
2518,A MYSTERY,"In witches’ wise, and rapt their forms from sight."
2519,A MYSTERY,"Dreams were they; less than dream, the noblest height"
2520,A MYSTERY,And farthest; and the chilly woodland wept.
2521,A MYSTERY,
2522,A MYSTERY,A sunless day and sad: yet all the while
2523,A MYSTERY,"Within the grave green twilight of the wood,"
2524,A MYSTERY,"Inscrutable, immutable, apart,"
2525,A MYSTERY,"Hearkening the brook, whose song she understood,"
2526,A MYSTERY,"The secret birch-tree kept her silver smile,"
2527,A MYSTERY,Strange as the peace that gleams at sorrow’s heart.
2528,A MYSTERY,
2529,A MYSTERY,
2530,THE COMMON STREET,THE COMMON STREET
2531,THE COMMON STREET,
2532,THE COMMON STREET,"The common street climbed up against the sky,"
2533,THE COMMON STREET,Gray meeting gray; and wearily to and fro
2534,THE COMMON STREET,"I saw the patient, common people go,"
2535,THE COMMON STREET,Each with his sordid burden trudging by.
2536,THE COMMON STREET,And the rain dropped; there was not any sigh
2537,THE COMMON STREET,"Or stir of a live wind; dull, dull and slow"
2538,THE COMMON STREET,All motion; as a tale told long ago
2539,THE COMMON STREET,The faded world; and creeping night drew nigh.
2540,THE COMMON STREET,
2541,THE COMMON STREET,"Then burst the sunset, flooding far and fleet,"
2542,THE COMMON STREET,Leavening the whole of life with magic leaven.
2543,THE COMMON STREET,Suddenly down the long wet glistening hill
2544,THE COMMON STREET,"Pure splendour poured--and lo! the common street,"
2545,THE COMMON STREET,"A golden highway into golden heaven,"
2546,THE COMMON STREET,With the dark shapes of men ascending still.

2553,ABRAHAM LINCOLN,"_February 12, 1909_"
2554,ABRAHAM LINCOLN,
2555,ABRAHAM LINCOLN,
2556,I,I
2557,I,
2558,I,"The centuries pass, yea as a dream they pass."
2559,I,"Nations and races, with all that they have sown,"
2560,I,"Sink as the prairie-grass,"
2561,I,By the invisible scythe silently mown.
2562,I,"The wind breathes over them, and the place thereof"
2563,I,Knows them no more.
2564,I,"But the unsounded sky still broods above,"
2565,I,"Blue ocean without shore,"
2566,I,Eternal in its breadth and depth and fire of love.
2567,I,"So the o’erbrooding Soul, purely ablaze,"
2568,I,"Full-flooded with the light of God,"
2569,I,"Outlasts Man’s body and all his works and ways,"
2570,I,Outlasts this little earth whereon he trod.
2571,I,
2572,I,
2573,II,II
2574,II,
2575,II,"We come not, then, to praise"
2576,II,"That which transcends our praises, but to crave"
2577,II,"The light of one great soul, kind as the sky,"
2578,II,"Upon these later days,--"
2579,II,"Not like the simpler time gone by,"
2580,II,"But set with snares of sense and ease,"
2581,II,And crowded with poor phantom flatteries
2582,II,"That serve us, and enslave."
2583,II,"We come, forgetting for a while"
2584,II,"Our million-peopled cities, pile on pile"
2585,II,Upsoaring starry-windowed in the night
2586,II,To perilous Babel-height;
2587,II,"We come, forgetting all our new-found powers,"
2588,II,"The magic of the mastery that is ours,"
2589,II,"The shoes of swiftness we may lightly wear,"
2590,II,"And that fresh-captived Ariel of the air,"
2591,II,"All, all that makes Man’s face to shine"
2592,II,"With pride of conquest, flushing him as wine,--"
2593,II,"We come, forgetting all, a little while"
2594,II,"To look in Lincoln’s eyes,"
2595,II,"So loving-sad, so kindly-wise;"
2596,II,"To stand, as judged, before his patient smile;"
2597,II,"Until his large mould shames us, and we know"
2598,II,"We are as children, yet have hope to grow,"
2599,II,Since this may be the stature of a man.
2600,II,
2601,II,
2602,III,III
2603,III,
2604,III,"Strangely his life began,"
2605,III,Rough-cradled in the savage wood.
2606,III,Haply our foolish softness grieves
2607,III,"O’er much that he found good,"
2608,III,"The hut of logs, the bed of leaves."
2609,III,"By the faint candle, or the winter’s fire,"
2610,III,"He groped to his desire,"
2611,III,"The long, lean, sallow, knowledge-hungry lad,"
2612,III,Deerskin or homespun clad.
2613,III,"Slow-stumbling upward, in good time he grew"
2614,III,"To that just man his little city knew,"
2615,III,"His plain, persuasive speech"
2616,III,"Shaped by an instinct none could ever teach,"
2617,III,"Savouring of honest earth, and sharp with wilding jest."
2618,III,Then came his country’s call.
2619,III,"Humble and hesitant, in doubt and dread,"
2620,III,And stooping that tall head
2621,III,"Black-ruffled like the eagle’s crest,"
2622,III,He passed up to the highest place of all.
2623,III,
2624,III,
2625,IV,IV
2626,IV,
2627,IV,"Ah, who shall tell the tale of those wild years,"
2628,IV,"Of pride and grief, of blood and tears?"
2629,IV,"The horror and the splendour and the sorrow,"
2630,IV,"The marching-songs of midnight, the sick fears"
2631,IV,Of every fateful morrow?
2632,IV,"Sometimes a waft of song, a random strain,"
2633,IV,Suddenly lifts a curtain in the brain:
2634,IV,"Some sweet old homesick soldier-ballad, one"
2635,IV,Beloved of many a sunburnt longing son
2636,IV,"Of Michigan or Maine,"
2637,IV,Or that light laughing tune wherewith the South
2638,IV,"Fifed her boy-soldiers blithe to the cannon’s mouth,--"
2639,IV,"Suddenly all is real once more,"
2640,IV,"The hoping, the despairing,"
2641,IV,"The pity and the passion and the daring,"
2642,IV,And all the agony of the Brother-War!
2643,IV,
2644,IV,
2645,V,V
2646,V,
2647,V,"Each bore his burden: but he all burdens bore,"
2648,V,Whose sad heart folded all the sufferers in;
2649,V,"While with a master’s steady hand he played,"
2650,V,"Mournful but undismayed,"
2651,V,That giant game where it was pain to win.
2652,V,"Ah, pain to win, but double death to lose!"
2653,V,"He saw the end, he knew the thing at stake"
2654,V,Was Manhood’s captain-jewel: he could not choose
2655,V,"But play the grim game out, though that great heart should break."
2656,V,"He smiled, as he had need"
2657,V,To keep him sane:
2658,V,Sad Lincoln laughed! on mountain-side or plain
2659,V,Not any soldier did a braver deed.
2660,V,
2661,V,
2662,VI,VI
2663,VI,
2664,VI,"Last, all his duty done,--"
2665,VI,"All the dark bondmen freed,"
2666,VI,"The long-sought leader found, the piteous victory won,--"
2667,VI,Arrived for him one hour of April sun
2668,VI,"Wherein he breathed free as the forest again,"
2669,VI,In glad goodwill to men
2670,VI,Nursing some vast forgiveness in his mind.
2671,VI,Then--all turned blank and blind.
2672,VI,Dare we remember the tragic lilac-time
2673,VI,Crimsoned with that mad crime?
2674,VI,"Nay, hush! Ye have heard how sacrifice must close"
2675,VI,The supreme service; ’tis the way God chose.
2676,VI,
2677,VI,
2678,VII,VII
2679,VII,
2680,VII,"Ah, haply we, the native-born,"
2681,VII,"And sprung of grandsires native too,"
2682,VII,Proud of soul this stately morn
2683,VII,"Would with his fame one race, one land indue;"
2684,VII,"Would claim him ours, and ours alone,"
2685,VII,"Flesh of our flesh, bone of our bone,"
2686,VII,Inseparably our own!
2687,VII,"Ours by the English name,"
2688,VII,"And that old England whence his forebears came,"
2689,VII,And that dear English of his tongue and pen;
2690,VII,Mightier successor of our most mighty men;
2691,VII,"Ours, by his birth beneath our western sky,"
2692,VII,"Ours, by the flag he died to save,"
2693,VII,"Ours, by the home-fields of his labour, and by"
2694,VII,The home-earth of his grave!
2695,VII,
2696,VII,
2697,VIII,VIII
2698,VIII,
2699,VIII,But hark! as if some league-long barrier broke
2700,VIII,"To let wide waters in tumultuously,"
2701,VIII,I hear the voices of the outland folk
2702,VIII,"From sea to sea--yea, rolling over-sea:"
2703,VIII,"“You shall not limit his large glory thus,"
2704,VIII,You shall not mete his greatness with a span!
2705,VIII,"This man belongs to us,"
2706,VIII,"Gentile and Jew, Teuton and Celt and Russ"
2707,VIII,And whatso else we be!
2708,VIII,This man belongs to Man!
2709,VIII,"And never, till a flood of love efface"
2710,VIII,"The hard distrusts that sever race from race,"
2711,VIII,Comes his true jubilee!
2712,VIII,"Never, till all the wars,"
2713,VIII,"Yea, even the noble wars that strive to peace,"
2714,VIII,"With all the thunder of all the drums shall cease,"
2715,VIII,And all the booming guns on all the brother-shores;
2716,VIII,"Never, till that worst strife of every day,"
2717,VIII,"More bitter-sordid than the clash of steel,"
2718,VIII,"By some new solving word our lips may learn to say,"
2719,VIII,"Be wholly done away,"
2720,VIII,"Deep-drowned in brotherhood, quenched in the common weal,"
2721,VIII,"Ah, never, till every spirit shall stand up free,"
2722,VIII,Comes the great Liberator’s jubilee!”
