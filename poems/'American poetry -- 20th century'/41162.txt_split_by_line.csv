99,PERSONAE,SCENE: _The Ash Wood of Malvern._
100,PERSONAE,
101,PERSONAE,
102,PERSONAE,"For I was a gaunt, grave councillor"
103,PERSONAE,"Being in all things wise, and very old,"
104,PERSONAE,But I have put aside this folly and the cold
105,PERSONAE,That old age weareth for a cloak.
106,PERSONAE,
107,PERSONAE,I was quite strong--at least they said so--
108,PERSONAE,The young men at the sword-play;
109,PERSONAE,"But I have put aside this folly, being gay"
110,PERSONAE,In another fashion that more suiteth me.
111,PERSONAE,
112,PERSONAE,"I have curled mid the boles of the ash wood,"
113,PERSONAE,I have hidden my face where the oak
114,PERSONAE,"Spread his leaves over me, and the yoke"
115,PERSONAE,Of the old ways of men have I cast aside.
116,PERSONAE,
117,PERSONAE,By the still pool of Mar-nan-otha
118,PERSONAE,Have I found me a bride
119,PERSONAE,That was a dog-wood tree some syne.
120,PERSONAE,She hath called me from mine old ways
121,PERSONAE,"She hath hushed my rancour of council,"
122,PERSONAE,Bidding me praise
123,PERSONAE,
124,PERSONAE,Naught but the wind that flutters in the leaves.
125,PERSONAE,
126,PERSONAE,"She hath drawn me from mine old ways,"
127,PERSONAE,Till men say that I am mad;
128,PERSONAE,"But I have seen the sorrow of men, and am glad,"
129,PERSONAE,For I know that the wailing and bitterness are a folly.
130,PERSONAE,And I? I have put aside all folly and all grief.
131,PERSONAE,I wrapped my tears in an ellum leaf
132,PERSONAE,And left them under a stone
133,PERSONAE,And now men call me mad because I have thrown
134,PERSONAE,"All folly from me, putting it aside"
135,PERSONAE,"To leave the old barren ways of men,"
136,PERSONAE,Because my bride
137,PERSONAE,"Is a pool of the wood, and"
138,PERSONAE,Though all men say that I am mad
139,PERSONAE,"It is only that I am glad,"
140,PERSONAE,"Very glad, for my bride hath toward me a great love"
141,PERSONAE,That is sweeter than the love of women
142,PERSONAE,That plague and burn and drive one away.
143,PERSONAE,
144,PERSONAE,Aie-e! 'Tis true that I am gay
145,PERSONAE,"Quite gay, for I have her alone here"
146,PERSONAE,And no man troubleth us.
147,PERSONAE,
148,PERSONAE,Once when I was among the young men....
149,PERSONAE,"And they said I was quite strong, among the young men."
150,PERSONAE,Once there was a woman....
151,PERSONAE,.... but I forget.... she was....
152,PERSONAE,.... I hope she will not come again.
153,PERSONAE,
154,PERSONAE,.... I do not remember....
155,PERSONAE,"I think she hurt me once, but...."
156,PERSONAE,That was very long ago.
157,PERSONAE,
158,PERSONAE,I do not like to remember things any more.
159,PERSONAE,
160,PERSONAE,I like one little band of winds that blow
161,PERSONAE,In the ash trees here:
162,PERSONAE,For we are quite alone
163,PERSONAE,Here mid the ash trees.

187,PERSONAE,"Eyes, dreams, lips, and the night goes."
188,PERSONAE,"Being upon the road once more,"
189,PERSONAE,They are not.
190,PERSONAE,Forgetful in their towers of our tuneing
191,PERSONAE,Once for Wind-runeing

211,PERSONAE,"But _you_, My Lord, how with your city?"

1074,I,"And he may sink unto strange depths, he tells me of,"
1075,I,That have no light as we it deem.
1076,I,E'en now he speaks strange words. I did not know
1077,I,One half the substance of his speech with me.
1078,I,And then when I saw naught he sudden leaped
1079,I,"And shot, a gleam of silver, down, away."
1080,I,And I have spent three days upon this rock
1081,I,And yet he comes no more.

1097,II,"Oimè, Oimè. I think each time they come"
1098,II,Up from the sea heart to the realm of air
1099,II,They are more far-removed from the shore.
1100,II,"When first I found him here, he slept"
1101,II,E'en as he might after a long night's taking on the deep.
1102,II,And when he woke some whit the old kind smile
1103,II,Dwelt round his lips and held him near to me.
1104,II,But then strange gleams shot through the grey-deep eyes
1105,II,As though he saw beyond and saw not me.
1106,II,And when he moved to speak it troubled him.
1107,II,And then he plucked at grass and bade me eat.
1108,II,And then forgot me for the sea its charm

1297,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,I did perceive that she enthroned two things:

1299,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"And dulled some while from dream, and then become"
1300,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"That lower thing, deductive intellect, I saw"

1302,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"And each of many, do we know"
1303,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,But the equation governing.
1304,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,And in my rapture at this vision's scope
1305,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"I saw no end or bourn to what things mean,"
1306,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,So praised Pythagoras and once more raised
1307,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"By this said rapture to the house of Dream,"

1312,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"And hailed her: ""Princess of the Opiates,"""
1313,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,And guessed her evil and her good thereby.

1315,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"And then a maid of nine ""Pavia"" hight,"
1316,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"Passed with a laugh that was all mystery,"
1317,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,And when I turned to her
1318,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"She reached me one clear chalice of white wine,"
1319,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,Pressed from the recent grapes that yet were hung
1320,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"Adown her shoulders, and were bound"
1321,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,Right cunningly about her elfish brows;
1322,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"So hale a draught, the life of every grape"
1323,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,Lurked without ferment in the amber cloud.
1324,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"And memory, this wine was, of all good."
1325,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,
1326,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"And more I might have seen: Firenza, Goito,"

1328,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"Cornelia of Colombo of far sight,"
1329,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"That, man and seer in one, had well been twain,"
1330,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,And each a glory to his hills and sea;
1331,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,And past her a great band
1332,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"Bright garlanded or rich with purple skeins,"
1333,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,And crimson mantles and queynt fineries
1334,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,That tarnished held but so the more
1335,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,Of dim allurement in their half-shown folds:
1336,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"So swept my vision o'er their filmy ranks,"
1337,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"Then rose some opaque cloud,"
1338,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"Whose name I have not yet discerned,"
1339,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,And music as I heard it one clear night
1340,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"Within our earthly night's own mirroring,"
1341,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"_Cioè_,--San Pietro by Adige,[11]"
1342,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"Where altar candles blazed out as dim stars,"
1343,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"And all the gloom was soft, and shadowy forms"
1344,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"Made and sang God, within the far-off choir."

1347,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,Two tapers shew the master of the keys
1348,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,As some white power pouring forth itself.
1349,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,
1350,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,And all the church rang low and murmured
1351,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,Thus in my dream of forms the music swayed.
1352,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,And I was lost in it and only woke
1353,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"When something like a mass bell rang, and then"
1354,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"That white-foot wind, pale Dawn's annunciatrice."
1355,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,"Me bore to earth again, but some strange peace"
1356,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,I had not known so well before this swevyn
1357,ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS,Clung round my head and made me hate earth less.
