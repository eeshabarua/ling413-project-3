112,MY FATHER,That has not known the power and pain
113,MY FATHER,
114,MY FATHER,Of life poured out like driven rain?

813,THE BEGGAR,
814,THE BEGGAR,"Once more Ben Ali was brought low, to see"
815,THE BEGGAR,
816,THE BEGGAR,"The king's clenched hand, fixed look, and rigid frown,"

818,THE BEGGAR,"Thrust from the palace gate to wander down,"
819,THE BEGGAR,

821,THE BEGGAR,
822,THE BEGGAR,Into the market where the traders came

824,THE BEGGAR,"With files of sag-necked camels o'er the sands,"
825,THE BEGGAR,
826,THE BEGGAR,Bringing the corded wares of hidden lands.
827,THE BEGGAR,
828,THE BEGGAR,"And walking there with eyes now wet and dim,"
829,THE BEGGAR,
830,THE BEGGAR,"He sought the beggar, found, and said to him:"

840,THE BEGGAR,
841,THE BEGGAR,"Answered the beggar. ""For I understood"
842,THE BEGGAR,
843,THE BEGGAR,To pay the evil back and keep the good
844,THE BEGGAR,
845,THE BEGGAR,Is increase of the good in merchandise;

851,THE BEGGAR,
852,THE BEGGAR,"Summoned the two to stand before his knee,"
853,THE BEGGAR,
854,THE BEGGAR,"And took the dinar from the beggar's hand,"
855,THE BEGGAR,
856,THE BEGGAR,"And giving to Ben Ali, gave command"
857,THE BEGGAR,
858,THE BEGGAR,"To those who waited for his word: ""Bring stones"

860,THE BEGGAR,"That he may beat with them this beggar's bones,"

863,THE BEGGAR,
864,THE BEGGAR,"And boasting wisdom, fouls her in the dust."""
865,THE BEGGAR,
866,THE BEGGAR,
867,THE BEGGAR,Ben Ali through his meditation heard
868,THE BEGGAR,
869,THE BEGGAR,"The counsellors approving the king's word,"
870,THE BEGGAR,
871,THE BEGGAR,And spoke above their even murmuring:

873,THE BEGGAR,"""Let justice be with God and with the king,"
874,THE BEGGAR,
875,THE BEGGAR,"Who are not subject to a moment's chance,"

886,THE BEGGAR,
887,THE BEGGAR,"His little corner of the noonday shade,"
888,THE BEGGAR,
889,THE BEGGAR,His wrongs forgotten as his debts unpaid.
890,THE BEGGAR,
891,THE BEGGAR,Let not the evil and the good we do
892,THE BEGGAR,
893,THE BEGGAR,"Be ghosts to haunt us, phantoms to pursue."
894,THE BEGGAR,
895,THE BEGGAR,I have the dinar and would fain be clear
896,THE BEGGAR,
897,THE BEGGAR,Of further trading with this beggar here;
898,THE BEGGAR,
899,THE BEGGAR,"For he nor I have caused the world to be,"
900,THE BEGGAR,
901,THE BEGGAR,"Nor govern kingdoms with our equity."""

905,THE BEGGAR,
906,THE BEGGAR,"God's justice hidden, and the king's astray?"""
907,THE BEGGAR,
908,THE BEGGAR,"Answered the king, slow-voiced, with brooding eyes."
909,THE BEGGAR,
910,THE BEGGAR,"""Art thou so weak, and strong to drive away"
911,THE BEGGAR,
912,THE BEGGAR,Far from to-day the ghost of yesterday?
913,THE BEGGAR,
914,THE BEGGAR,"Free is thy lifted head, while on mine own"
915,THE BEGGAR,
916,THE BEGGAR,The gathered past lies heavier than the crown?

924,THE BEGGAR,
925,THE BEGGAR,Were swift and silken on the palace floor.
926,THE BEGGAR,
927,THE BEGGAR,"The beggar went with grim, unchanging face"

1099,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1100,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Yet to these quiet pools,"

1102,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Calm with a thousand silent morns and eves,"

1119,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1120,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Hoping, some leafy hour, to feel,"

1123,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1124,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,A secret from the brown earth steal
1125,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1126,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Into my spirit, and reveal"
1127,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1128,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Some wisdom of a larger worth,"

1135,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1136,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Of melancholy night or shimmering dawn,"
1137,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1138,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Surely befits we wanderers wild
1139,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1140,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,To her confederate breast be reconciled;
1141,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1142,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Out of her primal sleep we came,"
1143,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1144,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,And she still dreams; of us that hold

1146,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Such strenuous course and venture bold,"
1147,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1148,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Whom such unknown ambition stirs,"

1153,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1154,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1155,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,How came he once to these green isles
1156,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1157,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"And channels winding miles and miles,"
1158,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1159,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Cross clasped in hand and pale face set,"

1164,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1165,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Of dead leaves in the blood,"
1166,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1167,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,The eager priest into their solitude
1168,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1169,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,And melancholy mood
1170,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1171,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Flashed like a lamp at night
1172,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1173,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,In sluggish sleepers' eyes;
1174,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1175,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Out of the east where mornings rise
1176,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1177,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Came like the morning into ashen skies
1178,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1179,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"With the east's subtle fire and surprise,"
1180,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1181,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,And stern beyond his knowledge brought
1182,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1183,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,A message other than he thought:
1184,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1185,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"""Lo! an edict here from the throne of fate,"
1186,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1187,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Whose banners are lifted and armies wait;
1188,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1189,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"The fight moves on at the front, it says,"
1190,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1191,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,And the word hath come after many days:
1192,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1193,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Ye shall walk no more in your ancient ways."""
1194,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1195,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1196,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Father, the word has come and gone,"
1197,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1198,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,The torpid races
1199,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1200,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Slumbered, and vanished from their places;"
1201,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1202,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,And in our ears intoning ring
1203,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1204,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,The words of that most weary king
1205,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1206,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"In Israel, King Solomon."
1207,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1208,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Over the earth's untroubled face
1209,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1210,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"The restless generations pace,"
1211,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1212,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Finding their graves regretfully;
1213,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1214,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Is there no crown, nor any worth,"
1215,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1216,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,For men who build upon the earth
1217,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1218,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,What time treads down forgetfully?
1219,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1220,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Unchanged the graven statute lies,"
1221,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1222,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,The code star-lettered in the skies.
1223,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1224,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"It is written there, it is written here;"
1225,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1226,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,The law that knows not far or near
1227,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1228,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1229,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Is sacrifice;
1230,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1231,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"And bird and flower, and beast and tree,"
1232,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1233,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Kingdom and planet wheeling free
1234,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1235,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Are sacrificed incessantly.
1236,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1237,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"From dark, through dusk, toward light, we tread"
1238,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1239,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,On the thorn-crowned foreheads of the dead.
1240,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1241,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,The law says not there is nothing lost;
1242,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1243,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,It only says that the end is gain;
1244,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1245,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,The gain may be at the helpless cost
1246,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1247,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Of hands that give in vain;
1248,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1249,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"And in this world, where many give,"
1250,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1251,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,None gives the widow's mite save he
1252,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1253,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"That, having but one life to live,"
1254,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1255,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Gives that one life so utterly.
1256,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1257,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Thou that unknowing didst obey,"
1258,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1259,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"With straitened thought and clouded eye,"
1260,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1261,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"The law, we learn at this late day,"
1262,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1263,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"O Père Marquette, whose war is done,"
1264,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1265,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Ours is the charge to bear it on,"
1266,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1267,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,To hold the veering banner high
1268,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1269,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1270,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Until we die,"
1271,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,

1273,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1274,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Our kindred earth we stand above,"
1275,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1276,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"If knowing sacrifice is law,"
1277,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1278,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,We sacrifice ourselves for love.
1279,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1280,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1281,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Or are we then such stuff as fills a dream?
1282,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1283,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Some wide-browed spirit dreams us, where he stands"
1284,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1285,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Watching the long twilight's stream
1286,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1287,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Below his solemn hands,"
1288,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1289,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Whose reverie and shaping thought began
1290,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,

1292,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1293,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Fluid we are, our days flow on,"
1294,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1295,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"And round them flow the rivers of the sun,"
1296,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1297,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,As long ago in places where
1298,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1299,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,The Halicarnassian wandered with his curious eyes
1300,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1301,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"On Egypt's mysteries,"
1302,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1303,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,And Babylonian gardens of the air
1304,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1305,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Hung green above the city wall.

1307,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"If this were all, if this were all--"
1308,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1309,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,If it were all of life to give
1310,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1311,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Our hearts to God and slip away,"
1312,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1313,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,And if the end for which we live
1314,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1315,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Were simple as the close of day,"
1316,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1317,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,"Were simple as the fathers say,"
1318,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1319,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Were simple as their peace was deep
1320,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1321,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,Who in the old faith fell asleep!
1322,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1323,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1324,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,No night bird now makes murmur; in the trees
1325,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1326,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,No drowsy chuckle of dark-nested ease.
1327,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1328,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,The campfire's last grey embers fall.
1329,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
1330,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,With dipping prow and shallop sides
1331,THE CHENEAUX ISLANDS,
