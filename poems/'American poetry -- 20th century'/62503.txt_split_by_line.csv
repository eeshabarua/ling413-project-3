1640,THE DEAD LOVER,May enter in.

1648,THE DEAD LOVER,Where lies my body underneath the sod.
1649,THE DEAD LOVER,Then night and day
1650,THE DEAD LOVER,I shall be where my dear false love may pass;
1651,THE DEAD LOVER,It will be sweet

1722,THE OTHER LOVER,
1723,THE OTHER LOVER,Here is a string of milky pearls
1724,THE OTHER LOVER,"For her to wear,"

1727,THE OTHER LOVER,"O neighbors, do not crowd me so!"
1728,THE OTHER LOVER,Stand by! stand by! for I must go

1731,THE OTHER LOVER,
1732,THE OTHER LOVER,"Good dame, why do you block the way"
1733,THE OTHER LOVER,And shake your head?
1734,THE OTHER LOVER,Must all the things you have to say
1735,THE OTHER LOVER,Just now be said?
1736,THE OTHER LOVER,"O neighbors, let me pass--but why--"
1737,THE OTHER LOVER,"My God, what makes you women cry?"
1738,THE OTHER LOVER,Come tell me that I too may die!
1739,THE OTHER LOVER,Is my love dead?

1741,THE OTHER LOVER,"“Nay, Marjorie’s a living thing,"

1783,AGE COMES A-WOOING,"Spoils maids and flowers of their grace,"
1784,AGE COMES A-WOOING,And every woman’s fate is cast
1785,AGE COMES A-WOOING,To be his paramour at last.
1786,AGE COMES A-WOOING,And so all lovely things are made
1787,AGE COMES A-WOOING,"Shameful, and in the ashes laid,"

1806,AGE COMES A-WOOING,Love saw my whitened hair and laughed
1807,AGE COMES A-WOOING,And bid me drain my bitter draught.
1808,AGE COMES A-WOOING,While in my lover’s startled eyes

1923,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1924,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1925,THE WAY OF LOVE,When darkness hovers over earth
1926,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And day gives place to night,"
1927,THE WAY OF LOVE,Then lovers see the Milky Way
1928,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Gleam mystically bright,"
1929,THE WAY OF LOVE,And calling it the Way of Love
1930,THE WAY OF LOVE,They hail it with delight.
1931,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1932,THE WAY OF LOVE,She was a lady wondrous fair
1933,THE WAY OF LOVE,"A right brave lover he,"
1934,THE WAY OF LOVE,And sooth they suffered grievous pain
1935,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And sorrowed mightily,"
1936,THE WAY OF LOVE,For they were parted during life
1937,THE WAY OF LOVE,By leagues of land and sea.
1938,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1939,THE WAY OF LOVE,She died. Then Death came to the man.
1940,THE WAY OF LOVE,"He met him joyfully,"
1941,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And said, “Thou Angel Death, well met!"
1942,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Quick, do thy will with me,"
1943,THE WAY OF LOVE,That I may haste to greet my love
1944,THE WAY OF LOVE,In Heaven’s company.”
1945,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1946,THE WAY OF LOVE,Now on one side of Heaven he dwelt
1947,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And on the other, she."
1948,THE WAY OF LOVE,And broad between them stretched sheer space
1949,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Whereon no way might be,"
1950,THE WAY OF LOVE,"The empty, yawning, awful depth,"
1951,THE WAY OF LOVE,Unplumbed infinity.
1952,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1953,THE WAY OF LOVE,The deathless spheric melody
1954,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Came gently to his ear,"
1955,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And dulcet notes, the harmonies"
1956,THE WAY OF LOVE,Of Seraphs chanting near.
1957,THE WAY OF LOVE,He heeded not for listening
1958,THE WAY OF LOVE,His lady’s voice to hear.
1959,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1960,THE WAY OF LOVE,The Saints and Martyrs round him ranged
1961,THE WAY OF LOVE,"A goodly company,"
1962,THE WAY OF LOVE,"The Virgin, robed in radiance,"
1963,THE WAY OF LOVE,The Holy Trinity.
1964,THE WAY OF LOVE,"He heeded not, but strained his eyes"
1965,THE WAY OF LOVE,His lady’s face to see.
1966,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1967,THE WAY OF LOVE,At last from far across the void
1968,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Her voice came, faint and sweet."
1969,THE WAY OF LOVE,The bright-hued walls of Paradise
1970,THE WAY OF LOVE,Did the glad sound repeat;
1971,THE WAY OF LOVE,The distant stars on which she stood
1972,THE WAY OF LOVE,Shone bright beneath her feet.
1973,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1974,THE WAY OF LOVE,"“Dear Love,” she said, “Oh, come to me!"
1975,THE WAY OF LOVE,I cannot see your face.
1976,THE WAY OF LOVE,O will not Lord Christ grant to us
1977,THE WAY OF LOVE,To cross this sea of space?”
1978,THE WAY OF LOVE,Then thrilled his heart with Love’s own might.
1979,THE WAY OF LOVE,"He answered, by Love’s grace."
1980,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1981,THE WAY OF LOVE,"“The world is wide, and Heaven is wide,"
1982,THE WAY OF LOVE,"From me to thee is far,"
1983,THE WAY OF LOVE,Alas! across Infinity
1984,THE WAY OF LOVE,No passageways there are.
1985,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Sweetheart, I’ll make my way to thee,"
1986,THE WAY OF LOVE,"I’ll build it, star by star!”"
1987,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1988,THE WAY OF LOVE,Through all the curving vault of sky
1989,THE WAY OF LOVE,His lusty blows rang out.
1990,THE WAY OF LOVE,He smote the jewel-studded walls
1991,THE WAY OF LOVE,And with a mighty shout
1992,THE WAY OF LOVE,He tore the gleaming masonry
1993,THE WAY OF LOVE,And posts that stood about.
1994,THE WAY OF LOVE,
1995,THE WAY OF LOVE,He strove to build a massive bridge
1996,THE WAY OF LOVE,That should the chasm span.
1997,THE WAY OF LOVE,With heart upheld by hope and love
1998,THE WAY OF LOVE,"His great task he began,"
1999,THE WAY OF LOVE,And toiled and labored doughtily
2000,THE WAY OF LOVE,To work his God-like plan.
2001,THE WAY OF LOVE,
2002,THE WAY OF LOVE,He took the heavy beams of gold
2003,THE WAY OF LOVE,That round him he did see;
2004,THE WAY OF LOVE,"The beryl, jacinth, sardius,"
2005,THE WAY OF LOVE,"That shone so brilliantly,"
2006,THE WAY OF LOVE,And no fair jewel would he spare
2007,THE WAY OF LOVE,So zealously worked he.
2008,THE WAY OF LOVE,
2009,THE WAY OF LOVE,He stole the gorgeous tinted stuffs
2010,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Whereof are sunsets made,"
2011,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And his rude, grasping, eager hands"
2012,THE WAY OF LOVE,On little stars he laid;
2013,THE WAY OF LOVE,To rob God’s sacred treasure-house
2014,THE WAY OF LOVE,He was no whit afraid.
2015,THE WAY OF LOVE,
2016,THE WAY OF LOVE,And so for centuries he worked.
2017,THE WAY OF LOVE,Across the void at last
2018,THE WAY OF LOVE,A bridge of precious mold did stand
2019,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Completed, strong and fast."
2020,THE WAY OF LOVE,So now the faithful lovers met
2021,THE WAY OF LOVE,And all their woe was past.
2022,THE WAY OF LOVE,
2023,THE WAY OF LOVE,But soon a shining angel guard
2024,THE WAY OF LOVE,Sped to the throne of gold
2025,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And said, “Lord, see yon new-made bridge,"
2026,THE WAY OF LOVE,"A mortal, overbold,"
2027,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Has built it, scorning thy desire!”"
2028,THE WAY OF LOVE,Straightway the tale he told.
2029,THE WAY OF LOVE,
2030,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Then said: “Now, Master, Thou mayst see"
2031,THE WAY OF LOVE,The thing that has been wrought.
2032,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Speak, then, the word, stretch forth Thine hand"
2033,THE WAY OF LOVE,That with the speed of thought
2034,THE WAY OF LOVE,This poor presumptuous work may fall
2035,THE WAY OF LOVE,And crumble into naught.”
2036,THE WAY OF LOVE,
2037,THE WAY OF LOVE,God looked upon the angel then
2038,THE WAY OF LOVE,And on the bridge below.
2039,THE WAY OF LOVE,Then with His smile of majesty
2040,THE WAY OF LOVE,"He said: “Let all things know,"
2041,THE WAY OF LOVE,"This bridge, which has by Love been built,"
2042,THE WAY OF LOVE,I will not overthrow.”
2043,THE WAY OF LOVE,
2044,THE WAY OF LOVE,When darkness hovers over earth
2045,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And day gives place to night,"
2046,THE WAY OF LOVE,Then lovers see the Milky Way
2047,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Gleam mystically bright,"
2048,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And calling it the Way of Love,"
2049,THE WAY OF LOVE,They hail it with delight.
2050,THE WAY OF LOVE,
2051,THE WAY OF LOVE,
