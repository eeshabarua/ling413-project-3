1335,(NEBRASKA),Hungry for distances;--her heart exulting
1336,(NEBRASKA),That God had made so many seas and countries
1337,(NEBRASKA),To break upon the eye and sweep behind her.
1338,(NEBRASKA),"From one whose love was tempered by discretion,"
1339,(NEBRASKA),From all the net of caution and convenience
1340,(NEBRASKA),"She snatched her high heart for the great adventure,"
1341,(NEBRASKA),"Broke her bright bubble under far horizons,--"
1342,(NEBRASKA),"Among the skirmishers that teased the future,"

1359,(NEBRASKA),"Over the red grass prairies, shaggy-coated,"
1360,(NEBRASKA),Without a goal the caravan proceeded;
1361,(NEBRASKA),"Across the tablelands and rugged ridges,"
1362,(NEBRASKA),"Through the coarse grasses which the oxen breasted,"
1363,(NEBRASKA),"Blue-stem and bunch-grass, red as sea-marsh samphire."

1365,(NEBRASKA),"Of the free-breathing earth in golden sunshine,"

1376,(NEBRASKA),
1377,(NEBRASKA),"A wagon-top, rocking in seas of grasses,"
1378,(NEBRASKA),"A camp-fire on a prairie chartless, trackless,"

1384,(NEBRASKA),"When cold, bright stars the sunburnt days succeeded,"
1385,(NEBRASKA),"She took me in her bed to sleep beside her,--"
1386,(NEBRASKA),"A sturdy bunch of life, born on the ocean."
1387,(NEBRASKA),Always she had the wagon cover lifted
1388,(NEBRASKA),Before her face. The sleepless hours till daybreak
1389,(NEBRASKA),She read the stars.
1390,(NEBRASKA),
1391,(NEBRASKA),"“Plenty of time for sleep,” she said, “hereafter.”"
1392,(NEBRASKA),
1393,(NEBRASKA),"She pointed out the spot on Macon prairie,"

1395,(NEBRASKA),"“And plant, one day, an apple orchard round me,"

1398,(NEBRASKA),"That night, within her bosom,"
1399,(NEBRASKA),I slept.
1400,(NEBRASKA),Before the morning
1401,(NEBRASKA),I cried because the breast was cold behind me.
1402,(NEBRASKA),
1403,(NEBRASKA),"Now, when the sky blazes like blue enamel,"
1404,(NEBRASKA),"Brilliant and hard over the blond cornfields,"
1405,(NEBRASKA),And through the autumn days our wind is blowing
1406,(NEBRASKA),Like the creative breath of God Almighty--
1407,(NEBRASKA),Then I rejoice that offended love demanded
1408,(NEBRASKA),"Such wide retreat, and such self-restitution;"
1409,(NEBRASKA),"Forged an explorer’s will in a frail woman,"
1410,(NEBRASKA),"Asked of her perfect faith and renunciation,"
1411,(NEBRASKA),"Hardships and perils, prophecy and vision,"
1412,(NEBRASKA),"The leadership of kin, and happy ending"
