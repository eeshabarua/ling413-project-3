46,PREFACE,
47,PREFACE,"In March, 1914, a volume appeared entitled ""Des Imagistes."" It was a"
48,PREFACE,"collection of the work of various young poets, presented together as a"
49,PREFACE,school. This school has been widely discussed by those interested in new
50,PREFACE,"movements in the arts, and has already become a household word."
51,PREFACE,"Differences of taste and judgment, however, have arisen among the"
52,PREFACE,contributors to that book; growing tendencies are forcing them along
53,PREFACE,different paths. Those of us whose work appears in this volume have
54,PREFACE,"therefore decided to publish our collection under a new title, and we have"
55,PREFACE,been joined by two or three poets who did not contribute to the first
56,PREFACE,"volume, our wider scope making this possible."
57,PREFACE,
58,PREFACE,In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that
59,PREFACE,"of the former Anthology. Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor,"
60,PREFACE,each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers
61,PREFACE,"his best, the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared"
62,PREFACE,in book form. A sort of informal committee--consisting of more than half
63,PREFACE,the authors here represented--have arranged the book and decided what
64,PREFACE,"should be printed and what omitted, but, as a general rule, the poets"
65,PREFACE,"have been allowed absolute freedom in this direction, limitations of space"
66,PREFACE,"only being imposed upon them. Also, to avoid any appearance of precedence,"
67,PREFACE,they have been put in alphabetical order.
68,PREFACE,
69,PREFACE,As it has been suggested that much of the misunderstanding of the former
70,PREFACE,"volume was due to the fact that we did not explain ourselves in a preface,"
71,PREFACE,"we have thought it wise to tell the public what our aims are, and why we"
72,PREFACE,are banded together between one set of covers.
73,PREFACE,
74,PREFACE,The poets in this volume do not represent a clique. Several of them are
75,PREFACE,"personally unknown to the others, but they are united by certain common"
76,PREFACE,"principles, arrived at independently. These principles are not new; they"
77,PREFACE,"have fallen into desuetude. They are the essentials of all great poetry,"
78,PREFACE,"indeed of all great literature, and they are simply these:--"
79,PREFACE,
80,PREFACE,"1. To use the language of common speech, but to employ always the _exact_"
81,PREFACE,"word, not the nearly-exact, nor the merely decorative word."
82,PREFACE,
83,PREFACE,2. To create new rhythms--as the expression of new moods--and not to copy
84,PREFACE,"old rhythms, which merely echo old moods. We do not insist upon"
85,PREFACE,"""free-verse"" as the only method of writing poetry. We fight for it as for"
86,PREFACE,a principle of liberty. We believe that the individuality of a poet may
87,PREFACE,often be better expressed in free-verse than in conventional forms. In
88,PREFACE,"poetry, a new cadence means a new idea."
89,PREFACE,
90,PREFACE,3. To allow absolute freedom in the choice of subject. It is not good art
91,PREFACE,to write badly about aeroplanes and automobiles; nor is it necessarily bad
92,PREFACE,art to write well about the past. We believe passionately in the artistic
93,PREFACE,"value of modern life, but we wish to point out that there is nothing so"
94,PREFACE,uninspiring nor so old-fashioned as an aeroplane of the year 1911.
95,PREFACE,
96,PREFACE,"4. To present an image (hence the name: ""Imagist""). We are not a school of"
97,PREFACE,"painters, but we believe that poetry should render particulars exactly and"
98,PREFACE,"not deal in vague generalities, however magnificent and sonorous. It is"
99,PREFACE,"for this reason that we oppose the cosmic poet, who seems to us to shirk"
100,PREFACE,the real difficulties of his art.
101,PREFACE,
102,PREFACE,"5. To produce poetry that is hard and clear, never blurred nor indefinite."
103,PREFACE,
104,PREFACE,"6. Finally, most of us believe that concentration is of the very essence"
105,PREFACE,of poetry.
106,PREFACE,
107,PREFACE,The subject of free-verse is too complicated to be discussed here. We may
108,PREFACE,"say briefly, that we attach the term to all that increasing amount of"
109,PREFACE,"writing whose cadence is more marked, more definite, and closer knit than"
110,PREFACE,"that of prose, but which is not so violently nor so obviously accented as"
111,PREFACE,"the so-called ""regular verse."" We refer those interested in the question"
112,PREFACE,"to the Greek Melic poets, and to the many excellent French studies on the"
113,PREFACE,subject by such distinguished and well-equipped authors as Remy de
114,PREFACE,"Gourmont, Gustave Kahn, Georges Duhamel, Charles Vildrac, Henri Ghéon,"
115,PREFACE,"Robert de Souza, André Spire, etc."
116,PREFACE,
117,PREFACE,We wish it to be clearly understood that we do not represent an exclusive
118,PREFACE,artistic sect; we publish our work together because of mutual artistic
119,PREFACE,"sympathy, and we propose to bring out our coöperative volume each year for"
120,PREFACE,"a short term of years, until we have made a place for ourselves and our"
121,PREFACE,principles such as we desire.

198,I,
199,I,"The bitterness, the misery, the wretchedness of childhood"
200,I,Put me out of love with God.
201,I,I can't believe in God's goodness;
202,I,I can believe
203,I,In many avenging gods.
204,I,Most of all I believe
205,I,"In gods of bitter dullness,"
206,I,Cruel local gods
207,I,Who seared my childhood.
208,I,
209,II,II
210,II,
211,II,I've seen people put
212,II,"A chrysalis in a match-box,"
213,II,"""To see,"" they told me, ""what sort of moth would come."""
214,II,But when it broke its shell
215,II,It slipped and stumbled and fell about its prison
216,II,And tried to climb to the light
217,II,For space to dry its wings.
218,II,
219,II,That's how I was.
220,II,Somebody found my chrysalis
221,II,And shut it in a match-box.
222,II,"My shrivelled wings were beaten,"
223,II,Shed their colours in dusty scales
224,II,Before the box was opened
225,II,For the moth to fly.
226,II,
227,II,"And then it was too late,"
228,II,"Because the beauty a child has,"
229,II,"And the beautiful things it learns before its birth,"
230,II,"Were shed, like moth-scales, from me."
231,II,
232,III,III
233,III,
234,III,I hate that town;
235,III,I hate the town I lived in when I was little;
236,III,I hate to think of it.
237,III,"There were always clouds, smoke, rain"
238,III,In that dingy little valley.
239,III,It rained; it always rained.
240,III,I think I never saw the sun until I was nine--
241,III,And then it was too late;
242,III,Everything's too late after the first seven years.
243,III,
244,III,That long street we lived in
245,III,Was duller than a drain
246,III,And nearly as dingy.
247,III,There were the big College
248,III,And the pseudo-Gothic town-hall.
249,III,There were the sordid provincial shops--
250,III,"The grocer's, and the shops for women,"
251,III,"The shop where I bought transfers,"
252,III,And the piano and gramaphone shop
253,III,Where I used to stand
254,III,Staring at the huge shiny pianos and at the pictures
255,III,Of a white dog looking into a gramaphone.
256,III,
257,III,How dull and greasy and grey and sordid it was!
258,III,On wet days--it was always wet--
259,III,I used to kneel on a chair
260,III,And look at it from the window.
261,III,
262,III,The dirty yellow trams
263,III,Dragged noisily along
264,III,With a clatter of wheels and bells
265,III,And a humming of wires overhead.
266,III,They threw up the filthy rain-water from the hollow lines
267,III,And then the water ran back
268,III,Full of brownish foam bubbles.
269,III,
270,III,There was nothing else to see--
271,III,It was all so dull--
272,III,Except a few grey legs under shiny black umbrellas
273,III,Running along the grey shiny pavements;
274,III,Sometimes there was a waggon
275,III,Whose horses made a strange loud hollow sound
276,III,With their hoofs
277,III,Through the silent rain.
278,III,
279,III,And there was a grey museum
280,III,Full of dead birds and dead insects and dead animals
281,III,And a few relics of the Romans--dead also.
282,III,"There was the sea-front,"
283,III,"A long asphalt walk with a bleak road beside it,"
284,III,"Three piers, a row of houses,"
285,III,And a salt dirty smell from the little harbour.
286,III,
287,III,I was like a moth---
288,III,Like one of those grey Emperor moths
289,III,Which flutter through the vines at Capri.
290,III,"And that damned little town was my match-box,"
291,III,Against whose sides I beat and beat
292,III,"Until my wings were torn and faded, and dingy"
293,III,As that damned little town.
294,III,
295,IV,IV
296,IV,
297,IV,At school it was just dull as that dull High Street.
298,IV,They taught me pothooks--
299,IV,"I wanted to be alone, although I was so little,"
300,IV,"Alone, away from the rain, the dingyness, the dullness,"
301,IV,Away somewhere else--
302,IV,
303,IV,The town was dull;
304,IV,The front was dull;
305,IV,The High Street and the other street were dull--
306,IV,"And there was a public park, I remember,"
307,IV,"And that was damned dull too,"
308,IV,"With its beds of geraniums no one was allowed to pick,"
309,IV,"And its clipped lawns you weren't allowed to walk on,"
310,IV,"And the gold-fish pond you mustn't paddle in,"
311,IV,"And the gate made out of a whale's jaw-bones,"
312,IV,"And the swings, which were for ""Board-School children,"""
313,IV,And its gravel paths.
314,IV,
315,IV,"And on Sundays they rang the bells,"
316,IV,From Baptist and Evangelical and Catholic churches.
317,IV,They had the Salvation Army.
318,IV,I was taken to a High Church;
319,IV,"The parson's name was Mowbray,"
320,IV,"""Which is a good name but he thinks too much of it--"""
321,IV,That's what I heard people say.
322,IV,
323,IV,I took a little black book
324,IV,"To that cold, grey, damp, smelling church,"
325,IV,"And I had to sit on a hard bench,"
326,IV,"Wriggle off it to kneel down when they sang psalms,"
327,IV,And wriggle off it to kneel down when they prayed--
328,IV,And then there was nothing to do
329,IV,Except to play trains with the hymn-books.
330,IV,
331,IV,"There was nothing to see,"
332,IV,"Nothing to do,"
333,IV,"Nothing to play with,"
334,IV,Except that in an empty room upstairs
335,IV,There was a large tin box
336,IV,"Containing reproductions of the Magna Charta,"
337,IV,Of the Declaration of Independence
338,IV,And of a letter from Raleigh after the Armada.
339,IV,"There were also several packets of stamps,"
340,IV,"Yellow and blue Guatemala parrots,"
341,IV,"Blue stags and red baboons and birds from Sarawak,"
342,IV,Indians and Men-of-war
343,IV,"From the United States,"
344,IV,And the green and red portraits
345,IV,Of King Francobollo
346,IV,Of Italy.
347,IV,
348,V,V
349,V,
350,V,I don't believe in God.
351,V,I do believe in avenging gods
352,V,Who plague us for sins we never sinned
353,V,But who avenge us.
354,V,
355,V,"That's why I'll never have a child,"
356,V,Never shut up a chrysalis in a match-box
357,V,"For the moth to spoil and crush its bright colours,"
358,V,Beating its wings against the dingy prison-wall.

376,THE POPLAR,The white lining of your green petticoat.
377,THE POPLAR,"The sky darts through you like blue rain,"
378,THE POPLAR,And the grey rain drips on your flanks
379,THE POPLAR,And loves you.
380,THE POPLAR,And I have seen the moon
381,THE POPLAR,Slip his silver penny into your pocket
382,THE POPLAR,As you straightened your hair;
383,THE POPLAR,And the white mist curling and hesitating
384,THE POPLAR,Like a bashful lover about your knees.
385,THE POPLAR,
386,THE POPLAR,"I know you, poplar;"

388,THE POPLAR,"But if you had a little real love,"
389,THE POPLAR,"A little strength,"
390,THE POPLAR,You would leave your nonchalant idle lovers
391,THE POPLAR,And go walking down the white road

1799,THE BOMBARDMENT,"shakes, the servitor quakes. Another goblet shivers and breaks. Boom!"
1800,THE BOMBARDMENT,
1801,THE BOMBARDMENT,"It rustles at the window-pane, the smooth, streaming rain, and he is shut"
1802,THE BOMBARDMENT,"within its clash and murmur. Inside is his candle, his table, his ink, his"
1803,THE BOMBARDMENT,"pen, and his dreams. He is thinking, and the walls are pierced with beams"
1804,THE BOMBARDMENT,"of sunshine, slipping through young green. A fountain tosses itself up at"
1805,THE BOMBARDMENT,"the blue sky, and through the spattered water in the basin he can see"
1806,THE BOMBARDMENT,"copper carp, lazily floating among cold leaves. A wind-harp in a"
1807,THE BOMBARDMENT,"cedar-tree grieves and whispers, and words blow into his brain, bubbled,"
1808,THE BOMBARDMENT,"iridescent, shooting up like flowers of fire, higher and higher. Boom! The"
1809,THE BOMBARDMENT,flame-flowers snap on their slender stems. The fountain rears up in long
1810,THE BOMBARDMENT,broken spears of disheveled water and flattens into the earth. Boom! And
1811,THE BOMBARDMENT,"there is only the room, the table, the candle, and the sliding rain."
1812,THE BOMBARDMENT,"Again, Boom!--Boom!--Boom! He stuffs his fingers into his ears. He sees"
1813,THE BOMBARDMENT,"corpses, and cries out in fright. Boom! It is night, and they are shelling"
1814,THE BOMBARDMENT,the city! Boom! Boom!
1815,THE BOMBARDMENT,
1816,THE BOMBARDMENT,"A child wakes and is afraid, and weeps in the darkness. What has made the"
1817,THE BOMBARDMENT,"bed shake? ""Mother, where are you? I am awake."" ""Hush, my Darling, I am"
1818,THE BOMBARDMENT,"here."" ""But, Mother, something so queer happened, the room shook."" Boom!"
1819,THE BOMBARDMENT,"""Oh! What is it? What is the matter?"" Boom! ""Where is Father? I am so"
1820,THE BOMBARDMENT,"afraid."" Boom! The child sobs and shrieks. The house trembles and creaks."
1821,THE BOMBARDMENT,Boom!
1822,THE BOMBARDMENT,
1823,THE BOMBARDMENT,"Retorts, globes, tubes, and phials lie shattered. All his trials oozing"
1824,THE BOMBARDMENT,"across the floor. The life that was his choosing, lonely, urgent, goaded"
1825,THE BOMBARDMENT,"by a hope, all gone. A weary man in a ruined laboratory, that was his"
1826,THE BOMBARDMENT,"story. Boom! Gloom and ignorance, and the jig of drunken brutes. Diseases"
1827,THE BOMBARDMENT,"like snakes crawling over the earth, leaving trails of slime. Wails from"
1828,THE BOMBARDMENT,people burying their dead. Through the window he can see the rocking
1829,THE BOMBARDMENT,"steeple. A ball of fire falls on the lead of the roof, and the sky tears"
1830,THE BOMBARDMENT,"apart on a spike of flame. Up the spire, behind the lacings of stone,"
1831,THE BOMBARDMENT,"zig-zagging in and out of the carved tracings, squirms the fire. It spouts"
1832,THE BOMBARDMENT,"like yellow wheat from the gargoyles, coils round the head of Saint John,"
1833,THE BOMBARDMENT,and aureoles him in light. It leaps into the night and hisses against the
1834,THE BOMBARDMENT,"rain. The Cathedral is a burning stain on the white, wet night."
1835,THE BOMBARDMENT,
1836,THE BOMBARDMENT,"Boom! The Cathedral is a torch, and the houses next to it begin to scorch."
1837,THE BOMBARDMENT,Boom! The bohemian glass on the _étagère_ is no longer there. Boom! A
1838,THE BOMBARDMENT,stalk of flame sways against the red damask curtains. The old lady cannot
1839,THE BOMBARDMENT,walk. She watches the creeping stalk and counts. Boom!--Boom!--Boom!
1840,THE BOMBARDMENT,
1841,THE BOMBARDMENT,"The poet rushes into the street, and the rain wraps him in a sheet of"
1842,THE BOMBARDMENT,silver. But it is threaded with gold and powdered with scarlet beads. The
1843,THE BOMBARDMENT,"city burns. Quivering, spearing, thrusting, lapping, streaming, run the"
1844,THE BOMBARDMENT,"flames. Over roofs, and walls, and shops, and stalls. Smearing its gold on"
1845,THE BOMBARDMENT,"the sky the fire dances, lances itself through the doors, and lisps and"
1846,THE BOMBARDMENT,chuckles along the floors.
1847,THE BOMBARDMENT,
1848,THE BOMBARDMENT,The child wakes again and screams at the yellow petalled flower flickering
1849,THE BOMBARDMENT,at the window. The little red lips of flame creep along the ceiling beams.
1850,THE BOMBARDMENT,
1851,THE BOMBARDMENT,The old man sits among his broken experiments and looks at the burning
1852,THE BOMBARDMENT,Cathedral. Now the streets are swarming with people. They seek shelter and
1853,THE BOMBARDMENT,"crowd into the cellars. They shout and call, and over all, slowly and"
1854,THE BOMBARDMENT,"without force, the rain drops into the city. Boom! And the steeple crashes"
1855,THE BOMBARDMENT,"down among the people. Boom! Boom, again! The water rushes along the"
1856,THE BOMBARDMENT,gutters. The fire roars and mutters. Boom!
