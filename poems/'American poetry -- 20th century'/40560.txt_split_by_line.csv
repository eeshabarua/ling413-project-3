166,PROEM,"If you can find, within, a single line"
167,PROEM,"To give you pleasure, then the pleasure's mine;"
168,PROEM,"But if you fail and whine, or _josh_ like Billings,"
169,PROEM,You might (I say you _might_!) get back your shillings.
170,PROEM,But better yet! Bestow this Book of Verses
171,PROEM,"On some friend-foe you love with hate and curses,"
172,PROEM,And your revenge will be attained thereafter
173,PROEM,"For, when he reads it, he will die with laughter."
174,PROEM,"And, Cheerful Reader, if this work contains"
175,PROEM,A soporific for your bulging brains
176,PROEM,"So that you'll _rave about it_ to your neighbors,"
177,PROEM,I'll feel repaid for all rebuffs and labors.
178,PROEM,"Though ""Wisdom sometimes borrows, sometimes lends,"""
179,PROEM,You'll borrow trouble lending this to friends;
180,PROEM,"But earn my thanks if, when you've praised or shown it,"
181,PROEM,You'll sit upon the lid and never loan it:
182,PROEM,"For ev'ry copy sold, thru friends or slapbacks,"
183,PROEM,Just puts Mo'lasses on my buckwheat flapjacks.
184,PROEM,"And, Critic Friend, who halts Ambition's flight"
185,PROEM,"And ties the can to Aspiration's kite,"
186,PROEM,Pray recollect that when _you_ plied the pen
187,PROEM,"And had some stuff accepted now and then,"
188,PROEM,"Your tales, O! Henry, did not prove inviting"
189,PROEM,Or else you'd be no Cynic but still writing.

207,BEHOLD A MAN!,He seeks no conquest but his lance is set
208,BEHOLD A MAN!,Against the ruthless Despot's parapet.
209,BEHOLD A MAN!,"Alert and conscious of his strength, his thrust"
210,BEHOLD A MAN!,"Is sure and timely, for his cause is just."
211,BEHOLD A MAN!,"Invincible, he rallies to his cause"
212,BEHOLD A MAN!,Those who love Justice and respect the laws.
213,BEHOLD A MAN!,To skulking traitors and to spying foes
214,BEHOLD A MAN!,"He shows no mercy, but his heart o'erflows"
215,BEHOLD A MAN!,"For those oppressed, who live, nay! who exist"
216,BEHOLD A MAN!,Where arrogance and tyranny persist:
217,BEHOLD A MAN!,"But, tho distressed by all this human grief,"
218,BEHOLD A MAN!,"He weeps not idly, but _compels_ relief:"
219,BEHOLD A MAN!,"And those he serves by act or speech or pen,"
220,BEHOLD A MAN!,"One Hundred Million _freemen_, shout, AMEN!"
221,BEHOLD A MAN!,"""Safe for Democracy the world must be,"
222,BEHOLD A MAN!,"And all its bondaged peoples shall be free!"""
223,BEHOLD A MAN!,So spake the MAN: America thus voiced

239,THE JULOGY,"To those who never heard my Songs before,"
240,THE JULOGY,"And those _who have_, and _want to nevermore_,"
241,THE JULOGY,"This Rhapsody, with all its pithy phrases,"
242,THE JULOGY,Has passed the Censors with the highest praises.
243,THE JULOGY,"Released by favor of the Board's caprice,"
244,THE JULOGY,It takes its proper place--a masterpiece!
245,THE JULOGY,"Soft pedal, please! The Knockers are outclassed,"
246,THE JULOGY,And Genius finds its recompense at last!
247,THE JULOGY,Whene'er I read about this war-time pelf
248,THE JULOGY,It makes me sick: I can't contain myself!
249,THE JULOGY,The profits on the _die_-stuffs sent to France
250,THE JULOGY,Make Croesus' wealth a trifling circumstance;
251,THE JULOGY,And what the Farmers get for mules and wheat
252,THE JULOGY,Makes fortunes hitherto quite obsolete.
253,THE JULOGY,In by-gone days the Bards were praised and pensioned
254,THE JULOGY,Who now are at the Front--and rarely mentioned:
255,THE JULOGY,And all these hardships they endure while men
256,THE JULOGY,"_Who write big checks_, thus scandalize the pen."
257,THE JULOGY,The Writers should throw off their yokes and collars
258,THE JULOGY,And drill their brains to cultivate the dollars.
259,THE JULOGY,The talents they possess are strictly mental
260,THE JULOGY,And can't be utilized for food and rental.
261,THE JULOGY,"Their thoughts are capital, but who'll invest"
262,THE JULOGY,In Sonnet Stock without some _interest_?
263,THE JULOGY,Or who'd take stock in Poem Plants? Alack!
264,THE JULOGY,He who invests expects the yellowback.
265,THE JULOGY,But here I'm talking _money_: what a joke
266,THE JULOGY,For one to thus discourse who's always broke!
267,THE JULOGY,"Since ""money talks"" we'll suffer it to speak,--"
268,THE JULOGY,"""I am the thing that countless millions seek;"
269,THE JULOGY,"Greed's inspiration, Evil's very root,"
270,THE JULOGY,The Nemesis of those in my pursuit.
271,THE JULOGY,"Kings pay me homage, pawn their crowns to me"
272,THE JULOGY,"And, deathless, I enslave their progeny."
273,THE JULOGY,"Men famed for noble deeds, who court my smile,"
274,THE JULOGY,Ofttimes surrender probity to guile:
275,THE JULOGY,"Who, needy, follows my uncertain path,"
276,THE JULOGY,"I may elude and favor him who hath,--"
277,THE JULOGY,"For I have wings, and lightning speeds my flight,--"
278,THE JULOGY,"Wealthy to-day, a pauper overnight!"
279,THE JULOGY,The Ticker tells the tale from day to day:
280,THE JULOGY,"Brings joy to some, to others dire dismay."""
281,THE JULOGY,
282,THE JULOGY,This Work is copyrighted just to show
283,THE JULOGY,To what low depths the Pirate Press will go.
284,THE JULOGY,"They borrow thunder from the Vulcan forge,"
285,THE JULOGY,Then draw the fire and put the smut on George.
286,THE JULOGY,"Each song or verse, it seems to me, should be"
287,THE JULOGY,Distinguished by originality
288,THE JULOGY,"If nothing else (the matter may be sloppy,--"
289,THE JULOGY,But that's no matter if there's ample copy)
290,THE JULOGY,So that the Author's face could be unmasked
291,THE JULOGY,And recognized without a question asked;
292,THE JULOGY,"Or, so identify Calliope"
293,THE JULOGY,By strident notes of high-toned quality;
294,THE JULOGY,"Or thus detect some Poet's ""fist"" and style"
295,THE JULOGY,By I. O. U.'s unhonored yet awhile.
296,THE JULOGY,"The Pirates thus would cease perforce their trade,"
297,THE JULOGY,And Bacon would not be confused with Ade.
298,THE JULOGY,"In all my songs I do the work myself,"
299,THE JULOGY,And draw no inspiration from the Shelf.
300,THE JULOGY,"Perhaps my lines would be more read, if cribbed,"
301,THE JULOGY,"But George and I, you know, have never fibbed,"
302,THE JULOGY,"And what is more, I think my lines are sweeter"
303,THE JULOGY,"Than those of Dante, with infernal meter;"
304,THE JULOGY,"And more heroic, and not half so sad"
305,THE JULOGY,As Homer's couplets in the _Ill_iad;
306,THE JULOGY,And far more musical and much prettier
307,THE JULOGY,Than those by Tennyson or by Whittier.
308,THE JULOGY,"Each bar is known to me, its licensee,"
309,THE JULOGY,And ev'ry note has had my scrutiny:
310,THE JULOGY,"I also watch my pauses, moods and tenses,"
311,THE JULOGY,And have no words with fair amanuenses.
312,THE JULOGY,If you could see my workshop (do not ask it!)
313,THE JULOGY,"You'd find more ""carbons"" in my paper-basket,"
314,THE JULOGY,"More rough, unpolished diamonds there immured"
315,THE JULOGY,"Than you, Dear Reader, ever have endured."
316,THE JULOGY,"I have no Jewish blood, not e'en a strain:"
317,THE JULOGY,That's what I lack! If ever born again
318,THE JULOGY,"I'd requisition Hebrew sire and dam,"
319,THE JULOGY,"Something akin, methinks, to Abraham,"
320,THE JULOGY,"And take these ""jewels,"" doomed unseen to flash,"
321,THE JULOGY,"Gloss o'er their flaws, and turn them into cash."
322,THE JULOGY,Here's where I doff my bonnet to the Jew!
323,THE JULOGY,Tho' sore oppressed they're still the Chosen Few:
324,THE JULOGY,A _few_ in numbers but a mighty host
325,THE JULOGY,"When reckoned by the things that count the most,--"
326,THE JULOGY,"I mean _achievements_, won by toilsome stages"
327,THE JULOGY,In spite of persecutions thru the Ages.
328,THE JULOGY,
329,THE JULOGY,I see these Davids watching o'er their flocks
330,THE JULOGY,In Palestine. (To-day they watch their stocks
331,THE JULOGY,"And clip the coupons from their bonds, you see,"
332,THE JULOGY,Just as they sheared the lambs in Galilee.)
333,THE JULOGY,_There_ milk and honey in abundance vied
334,THE JULOGY,To keep the Simple Simons satisfied;
335,THE JULOGY,"But _here_ to luxuries the Josephs cling,"
336,THE JULOGY,And milk the honey from most everything.
337,THE JULOGY,Time was when you were treated with disdain
338,THE JULOGY,"But now the tune is quite a changed refrain,"
339,THE JULOGY,And Gentiles everywhere take special pains
340,THE JULOGY,To pay respectful tribute to your brains!
341,THE JULOGY,Behold your ancient hills and rugged rocks;
342,THE JULOGY,Your fruitful valleys with their golden shocks
343,THE JULOGY,"Of Grain that, grouped around the stately dates,"
344,THE JULOGY,Seem to defy the _threshing_ that awaits!
345,THE JULOGY,Here olives ripen 'neath the summer skies
346,THE JULOGY,"And yield rich oil,--first Standard Oil supplies;"
347,THE JULOGY,'Twas here the mighty Samson filled with awe
348,THE JULOGY,The Philistines and flayed them with his jaw;
349,THE JULOGY,"(No man before, or since, thus courted fame,"
350,THE JULOGY,For woman holds these records in _her_ name.)
351,THE JULOGY,And here wise Solomon refused the vote
352,THE JULOGY,In statecraft matters to the Petticoat;
353,THE JULOGY,But when the Referendum was installed
354,THE JULOGY,The wise old King's objection was Recalled.
355,THE JULOGY,"And then there's David caring for his sheep,"
356,THE JULOGY,And big Goliath (_rocking_ him to sleep).
357,THE JULOGY,"There Japheth, Shem and Ham are; Ham tabooed"
358,THE JULOGY,By Moses in his Treatises on Food;
359,THE JULOGY,And Jehu with his pair of chestnut colts
360,THE JULOGY,Trotting the highway down like thunderbolts.
361,THE JULOGY,If Jehu _reined_ to-day he'd swap his stable
362,THE JULOGY,"For high-power Auto, with a foreign label,"
363,THE JULOGY,And hold the record for the Shore Road trip
364,THE JULOGY,"From Tyre to Sidon at a lightning clip,--"
365,THE JULOGY,"And make his whiskers, driven by the breeze,"
366,THE JULOGY,Look like a storm-tossed frigate on the seas.
367,THE JULOGY,"There's Jacob dreaming, seeing more than Esau,"
368,THE JULOGY,And giving him the double-cross and hee-haw;
369,THE JULOGY,Obtaining Esau's birthright (Silly Dupe!)
370,THE JULOGY,For three brass spheroids and a bowl of soup.
371,THE JULOGY,He traded for it--didn't have to buy it!
372,THE JULOGY,"'Cause Brother Hairy, glutton, wouldn't diet."
373,THE JULOGY,"But ""chickens come back home to roost,"" forsooth,"
374,THE JULOGY,"And Jacob in his dotage learned this truth,"
375,THE JULOGY,"When Leah's sons, of ordinary clay,"
376,THE JULOGY,Put Rachel's Joseph in the consommé.
377,THE JULOGY,
378,THE JULOGY,"As Financiers the palm has been bestowed,"
379,THE JULOGY,"In panegyric, melody and ode,"
380,THE JULOGY,"On Jacob's sons. The caravans, that passed"
381,THE JULOGY,"Thru burning sands, from cities far and vast,"
382,THE JULOGY,"Into their land that teemed with grain and gold,"
383,THE JULOGY,"Were richly laden. Thus they bought and sold,"
384,THE JULOGY,"Exchanging corn and cattle, hides and honey"
385,THE JULOGY,"For finest silks and linens, gems and money,--"
386,THE JULOGY,"Until, thru bargain-insight, skill and daring,"
387,THE JULOGY,"They cornered all the fabrics used for wearing,"
388,THE JULOGY,"And then proceeded, with discerning lust,"
389,THE JULOGY,To hump themselves and form a Camel Trust.
390,THE JULOGY,The Traders who had plied this Cargo Route
391,THE JULOGY,"Could never, in their deals, get cash to boot"
392,THE JULOGY,"From Jacob's sons. Sometimes a fleece or skin,"
393,THE JULOGY,"Of little size and worth, would be thrown in,"
394,THE JULOGY,But shekels--No! And so the nomad Sheik
395,THE JULOGY,In quest of easy picking; Turk and Greek;
396,THE JULOGY,The wily Fellah from the distant Nile
397,THE JULOGY,"Whose gaudy gewgaw ""gems"" reflect his guile;"
398,THE JULOGY,"The sleepy Peddlers from the Land of Nod,"
399,THE JULOGY,Who still shekinah on ancestral sod;
400,THE JULOGY,And all the Wise Men from the Eastern marts
401,THE JULOGY,"Who plan their ventures by the Astral charts,"
402,THE JULOGY,"Plotted and vowed, by Imps and Endor Witches,"
403,THE JULOGY,To wrest from Jacobs Brothers all their riches.
404,THE JULOGY,"So, working now with Bulls, anon with Bears;"
405,THE JULOGY,Rigging the market to advance their wares
406,THE JULOGY,"Or to depress the House of Jacobs' shares,"
407,THE JULOGY,It looked as if the plotters might make good
408,THE JULOGY,Against the unsuspecting Brotherhood.
409,THE JULOGY,"But patiently the Brethren stood their ground,"
410,THE JULOGY,"Unmindful of the rumors passed around,"
411,THE JULOGY,"Or baits to tempt Cupidity thrown out,"
412,THE JULOGY,"That throttle Judgment and put Sense to rout,--"
413,THE JULOGY,"Until the market, unsupported, broke:"
414,THE JULOGY,"Then, feigning sleep, they suddenly awoke"
415,THE JULOGY,And took possession of the Stock Exchange.
416,THE JULOGY,Like beaten curs or mongrels with the mange
417,THE JULOGY,The Plotters cringed. The _Shorts_ in wild dismay
418,THE JULOGY,"To cover ran, but Zounds! they had to pay"
419,THE JULOGY,Four prices to the Brethren who controlled
420,THE JULOGY,The entire issue of the short stock sold.
421,THE JULOGY,"And thus the Brethren made a tidy sum,"
422,THE JULOGY,Keeping their standing in Financialdom.
423,THE JULOGY,"Keen businessmen, they sold or bought as well,"
424,THE JULOGY,But never showed _anxiety_ to sell.
425,THE JULOGY,
426,THE JULOGY,"So Jacob's Sons became, as was their bent,"
427,THE JULOGY,The mighty Merchants of the Orient.
428,THE JULOGY,No goose that ever layed a golden egg
429,THE JULOGY,Would needs have come to one of them to beg
430,THE JULOGY,"For life or respite. ""Nay! Lay on, Good Goose!"
431,THE JULOGY,"We'll shield thee and thy gander from abuse!"""
432,THE JULOGY,"Long-headed and kind-hearted, in such cases"
433,THE JULOGY,Their noses were not lopped to spite their faces.
434,THE JULOGY,Too wise they were: they had too good a teacher
435,THE JULOGY,To make the nose too prominent a feature!
436,THE JULOGY,While yet the goose was itching for the nest
437,THE JULOGY,They egged her on and Quack! she did the rest.
438,THE JULOGY,A goose she would appear to give so much
439,THE JULOGY,To those who had--but Life is ever such.
440,THE JULOGY,"But Jacob's Sons like Isaac, sturdy Oak,"
441,THE JULOGY,"Made no complaint but bore their golden yolk,"
442,THE JULOGY,"And, thrifty men, in many baskets stored"
443,THE JULOGY,The golden ovals and increased their hoard.
444,THE JULOGY,"And so their nests were feathered, as we know,"
445,THE JULOGY,"But cautious men they were, who didn't crow."
446,THE JULOGY,"And so we see them on the filmy screens,"
447,THE JULOGY,Matching their talents 'gainst the Philistines:
448,THE JULOGY,"And looking close, we notice that the Brothers"
449,THE JULOGY,Have bigger _stacks_ before them than the others.
450,THE JULOGY,
451,THE JULOGY,"And then there's Job, the Paradox, who toils"
452,THE JULOGY,To show good humor when beset by boils;
453,THE JULOGY,"And Jinxy Jonah, ducked and rudely whaled,"
454,THE JULOGY,Because he had no passport when he sailed.
455,THE JULOGY,(Whene'er I see the Ocean Mammal spout
456,THE JULOGY,Methinks it's habit--_spewing Jonah out_.)
457,THE JULOGY,"Delilah's ""next""! Tonsorial Adept--"
458,THE JULOGY,A cutting up while headstrong Samson slept.
459,THE JULOGY,Shear nonsense--that man's vigor could be sapped
460,THE JULOGY,"Because he had a haircut when he napped,"
461,THE JULOGY,"Or lose his nerve, e'en at the yawning grave,"
462,THE JULOGY,Tho' just escaping by the closest shave.
463,THE JULOGY,"With Samson's case a multitude compare,"
464,THE JULOGY,For men miss greatness ofttimes by a hair.
465,THE JULOGY,"'Twas his conceit that made him lose his nerve,"
466,THE JULOGY,"As long-haired, whiskered men, bereft, deserve."
467,THE JULOGY,The facts are these: that Samson used to wear
468,THE JULOGY,"A wig with ringlets, 'cause his head was bare."
469,THE JULOGY,"One night, in playful mood, Delilah stole"
470,THE JULOGY,Up to his cot and touched the poor old soul
471,THE JULOGY,"For his toupee. He woke, chagrined, and fled"
472,THE JULOGY,Because his capillary roots were dead.
473,THE JULOGY,What transformation! Thus the Man of Might
474,THE JULOGY,"Became a pussyfooter overnight,"
475,THE JULOGY,And went to writing verses from that minute
476,THE JULOGY,"Finding his strength, not _on_ his head, but in it."
477,THE JULOGY,
478,THE JULOGY,"Of all your rulers, Roman, Jew or Fezzer,"
479,THE JULOGY,The first or most pronounced is Nebu'nezzar.
480,THE JULOGY,"(_Too long_ this monstrous name has been derided,"
481,THE JULOGY,"And so the _chad_, for rhythm, is elided.)"
482,THE JULOGY,"""Neb"" is enough, for short, and apropos"
483,THE JULOGY,"Of Shadrach, Meshack and Abednego,"
484,THE JULOGY,The King waxed wroth because these three live wires
485,THE JULOGY,Passed thru his melting pots and furnace fires
486,THE JULOGY,Without a burn: remarkable endurance!
487,THE JULOGY,Because protected by good Fire Insurance.
488,THE JULOGY,"He paid the price for arson ere he died,"
489,THE JULOGY,Was kept lit up and rightly classified
490,THE JULOGY,Among the beasts: and now that all is over
491,THE JULOGY,"'Tis safe to say he did not live in clover,"
492,THE JULOGY,"But roamed the pastures, when he lost his pull,"
493,THE JULOGY,And grazed himself to death: he was _some_ bull.
494,THE JULOGY,
495,THE JULOGY,"Then next we come to Ruth, the Moabite:"
496,THE JULOGY,Her husband Chilion (not her!) one night
497,THE JULOGY,"Blew out the gas, and Ruth was thus bereft;"
498,THE JULOGY,"But Naomi, her Ma-in-Law, was left"
499,THE JULOGY,To comfort her: and jolly well she did it!
500,THE JULOGY,For Ruth's great grief soon ceased or else she hid it.
501,THE JULOGY,"Then to Naomi's Land the two repaired,"
502,THE JULOGY,Their love enhanced by sorrows they had shared.
503,THE JULOGY,And so the elder of the widowed twain
504,THE JULOGY,"Set out to find, for Ruth, another swain;"
505,THE JULOGY,"And all her schemes, 'tis said, succeeded so as"
506,THE JULOGY,To marry Ruth to wealthy kinsman Boaz.
507,THE JULOGY,"Unselfish? No! _She_ was too old to wed,"
508,THE JULOGY,"So Ruth agreed to give her board and bed,"
509,THE JULOGY,Trusting to Boaz not to spoil her plan
510,THE JULOGY,Who swallowed hook and line like any man.
511,THE JULOGY,"The attic room, or one just off the hall,"
512,THE JULOGY,Was where Naomi nightly had to crawl;
513,THE JULOGY,"And all her meals, unleavened bread and 'taters,"
514,THE JULOGY,"Were eaten in the kitchen with the waiters,--"
515,THE JULOGY,"For Boaz, when the honeymoon was spent,"
516,THE JULOGY,Tightened his purse-strings--wouldn't spend a cent!
517,THE JULOGY,"And Naomi as welcome was, I think,"
518,THE JULOGY,As hungry roaches in the kitchen sink.
519,THE JULOGY,"This is the only case,--I know no other!"
520,THE JULOGY,Where widowed wife abided husband's mother;
521,THE JULOGY,"Or, where a woman, in such circumstance,"
522,THE JULOGY,Would give her son's relict another chance.
523,THE JULOGY,
524,THE JULOGY,There's Baal and those exalting Gods of brass;
525,THE JULOGY,"And Balaam, Prophet: but we'll let him pass!"
526,THE JULOGY,"And John the Baptist, man who lost his head"
527,THE JULOGY,"To fair Salomé, tho she cut him dead."
528,THE JULOGY,"There's Absalom the Vain, whose hair was long,"
529,THE JULOGY,"Who, in the final parting, got in wrong:"
530,THE JULOGY,"And Pharaoh, with chariots and fighters"
531,THE JULOGY,Pursuing Moses and the Israeliters;
532,THE JULOGY,"Who, half-seas over, when the King dropped in,"
533,THE JULOGY,"Punished the latter for his divers sin,"
534,THE JULOGY,"And rescued on the Red Sea bar his folk,"
535,THE JULOGY,Athirst for freedom from the Ptolemy yoke.
536,THE JULOGY,
537,THE JULOGY,While yet the rushes bent beneath the blast
538,THE JULOGY,"Of Red Sea winds, a prodigy was cast."
539,THE JULOGY,"(From common _mold_, perhaps, but 'tis enough"
540,THE JULOGY,To know that he was made of proper stuff.)
541,THE JULOGY,And little did the Tempest wot his noise
542,THE JULOGY,Was silence likened to the bawling boy's.
543,THE JULOGY,"The Earth breathed on the shape and gave it speech,"
544,THE JULOGY,"Or something vocally akin, a screech."
545,THE JULOGY,Thus Moses had his coming out--and lo!
546,THE JULOGY,He rushed into the arms of Fairy O
547,THE JULOGY,"(Daughter of Pharaoh, the mighty King)"
548,THE JULOGY,Who bore him to the Palace 'neath her wing.
549,THE JULOGY,"Fed on the Milk of Kindness to begin,"
550,THE JULOGY,"With Medica Materia thrown in,"
551,THE JULOGY,"He grew until appointed, by decree,"
552,THE JULOGY,"To Little Egypt, Princess, the M.D."
553,THE JULOGY,"Thus Doctor Moses hung his shingle out,"
554,THE JULOGY,And soon his fame was heralded about.
555,THE JULOGY,"To doctors since, no fame like his doth cling:"
556,THE JULOGY,No Specialist: he doctored everything!
557,THE JULOGY,He analyzed and stopped the human leak;
558,THE JULOGY,"(His patience was rewarded, so to speak)"
559,THE JULOGY,"He charged his people to eschew the swine,"
560,THE JULOGY,And made the Ten Commandments seem benign.
561,THE JULOGY,"Not only as Physician did he rate,"
562,THE JULOGY,But as a Surgeon: he could amputate!
563,THE JULOGY,He cut off Pharaoh in his pursuit
564,THE JULOGY,"And, by this operation, gained repute."
565,THE JULOGY,He set his people right and made no bones
566,THE JULOGY,Of driving lepers from the Safety Zones;
567,THE JULOGY,"He gave them tablets for their moral healing,"
568,THE JULOGY,Knowing their pulses without even feeling.
569,THE JULOGY,His praises now resound from every lip
570,THE JULOGY,Because he saved the Jews from Phar'oh's grippe.
571,THE JULOGY,Still 'long the Nile the pink-winged curlews flock
572,THE JULOGY,Where Moses took his henchmen out of hock;
573,THE JULOGY,"The minions of Æolus hurtle on,"
574,THE JULOGY,"Leaving a trail of foam the waves upon,--"
575,THE JULOGY,"Stopping anon, where restless driftwood crushes"
576,THE JULOGY,"The lotus pads that hover near the rushes,"
577,THE JULOGY,To chant a requiem and breathe a prayer
578,THE JULOGY,Over the spot that cradled Moses there.
579,THE JULOGY,If modern doctors would obey the rule
580,THE JULOGY,Of common sense prescribed by Moses' School;
581,THE JULOGY,If they would note our pulses and our looks
582,THE JULOGY,Instead of feeling of our pocket-books
583,THE JULOGY,"And judging circulation by the latter,"
584,THE JULOGY,"We'd sometimes know, perhaps, just what's the matter."
585,THE JULOGY,What doctor now would diagnosis make
586,THE JULOGY,"And call it simple, old-time belly-ache,"
587,THE JULOGY,Charging a trifling fee to cure the pain?
588,THE JULOGY,"Ah, no! those days will not return again!"
589,THE JULOGY,"No more, alas! will green-fruit cramps delight us,"
590,THE JULOGY,For colic now is styled appendicitis.
591,THE JULOGY,"By leaps and bounds have grown the ""trifling fees"";"
592,THE JULOGY,"""Five hundred!"" now, succeeds ""One Dollar, please!"""
593,THE JULOGY,"And germs, in league with doctors, have their station"
594,THE JULOGY,"At vital points to force inoculation,"
595,THE JULOGY,So that our Systems pay a pretty price
596,THE JULOGY,"For ev'ry nostrum, ev'ry fake device"
597,THE JULOGY,Known to the School of Quacks: and so we suffer
598,THE JULOGY,Imposed upon by patentee and duffer.
599,THE JULOGY,"O, for a Moses! That's our crying need--"
600,THE JULOGY,To cure Physicians of unbridled greed
601,THE JULOGY,"And probe, no matter where it hurts, the cause"
602,THE JULOGY,Of Doctors' strange immunity from laws.
603,THE JULOGY,O! for an instrument--an act or sermon--
604,THE JULOGY,Of Moses' kind--to cut the germ from German!
605,THE JULOGY,And lead them from the Wilderness of Vice
606,THE JULOGY,Whose hearts were warm but now have turned to ice!
607,THE JULOGY,
608,THE JULOGY,All these and many more increase the lustre
609,THE JULOGY,Distinguishing this brilliant Jewish cluster.
610,THE JULOGY,"And Abraham? We save him for the last,"
611,THE JULOGY,"Tho first in line, renowned Iconoclast."
612,THE JULOGY,"Of all the Israelites, the men of mark,"
613,THE JULOGY,Who else compares with this grand Patriarch?
614,THE JULOGY,"And who besides, of all the racial roots,"
615,THE JULOGY,"Developed half the lusty leaves and shoots,"
616,THE JULOGY,"Strong limbs and branches, virile seed? _some_ trunk!"
617,THE JULOGY,"The Ark, with all this luggage, would have sunk!"
618,THE JULOGY,And so 'twere well the Deluge didst o'erwhelm
619,THE JULOGY,"The Earth, ere this, with Noah at the helm,"
620,THE JULOGY,Else to preserve the chosen and elite
621,THE JULOGY,Of Israel's line would needs have taxed a fleet.
622,THE JULOGY,
623,THE JULOGY,I love these ancient tribesmen who illumine
624,THE JULOGY,The Archives of the Past: they were so human!
625,THE JULOGY,Their frailties were but habits of the Race
626,THE JULOGY,Since Father Adam set the human pace
627,THE JULOGY,"Hitched up with Eve who, chafing at the bit,"
628,THE JULOGY,"Did well her part or bit, in spite of it."
629,THE JULOGY,But all their mortal weaknesses were nil
630,THE JULOGY,Compared with virtues that their Records fill;
631,THE JULOGY,"And good or bad, or medium or fair,"
632,THE JULOGY,No Tribe excelled their morals anywhere.
633,THE JULOGY,"They freely gave their tithes, but did it pay"
634,THE JULOGY,To advertise their wealth? a give away!
635,THE JULOGY,And so their pockets have been worn and frayed
636,THE JULOGY,By frequent contributions they have made
637,THE JULOGY,To Charity and Church. I hope and pray
638,THE JULOGY,They've saved a little for a rainy day!
639,THE JULOGY,"I think they have! for Money talked,--confessed"
640,THE JULOGY,"That Hebrews were the ones he liked the best,"
641,THE JULOGY,"Because they never slighted or abused him,"
642,THE JULOGY,And always were so careful how they used him.
643,THE JULOGY,
644,THE JULOGY,"And so, O Sons of Abraham, I say"
645,THE JULOGY,You've come into your own and come to stay!
646,THE JULOGY,"The Promised Land is yours, but what is more,"
647,THE JULOGY,The Earth and Seas and Skies with all their store.
648,THE JULOGY,"You wandered from Judea, but why care?"
649,THE JULOGY,Because your home is here as well as there;
650,THE JULOGY,"And we would miss you just as much, I vum,"
651,THE JULOGY,As those who wait you in Capernaum;
652,THE JULOGY,For Broadway would despair and sackcloth don
653,THE JULOGY,If you should leave New York for Ascalon.
654,THE JULOGY,
655,THE JULOGY,"No more, thank God! will Infidels profane"
656,THE JULOGY,Jerusalem. For centuries the stain
657,THE JULOGY,Of Turkish rule has laid its unclean hand
658,THE JULOGY,Upon the Altars of the Holy Land.
659,THE JULOGY,"But now the Prophet's promise is fulfilled,"
660,THE JULOGY,And Jews and Gentiles are rejoiced and thrilled
661,THE JULOGY,"As Men of Allenby, God's Sword, restore"

1541,FIXING THE BLAME,A stranger 'twas who made us come to blows!
1542,FIXING THE BLAME,It happened thus: a mighty Nimrod came

1544,FIXING THE BLAME,"Until his cudgel bore a hundred nicks,"
1545,FIXING THE BLAME,(A record this for all Prodigious Sticks)
1546,FIXING THE BLAME,"To Germany. No pussyfoot was his,"
1547,FIXING THE BLAME,But there was courage in his Nobel phiz;
1548,FIXING THE BLAME,And in his stride were energy and grace
1549,FIXING THE BLAME,Enough to make the goose-step commonplace.
1550,FIXING THE BLAME,"I took him to my Palace, as my guest,"
1551,FIXING THE BLAME,"And poured libations from the cellar's _best_,"
1552,FIXING THE BLAME,(He was a _certified_ non-drinker--See?

1554,FIXING THE BLAME,And then arranged to hold a Grand Review

1556,FIXING THE BLAME,"'De-lighted!' said my guest, and nothing more,"
1557,FIXING THE BLAME,As we reviewed my legions corps by corps;
1558,FIXING THE BLAME,"But this blunt comment signified his zeal,"
1559,FIXING THE BLAME,And so I mobilized my fleet at Kiel;
1560,FIXING THE BLAME,"And on my Royal Yacht, my guest and I"
1561,FIXING THE BLAME,Watched the maneuvres as my ships passed by.
1562,FIXING THE BLAME,"'De-lighted, Bill!' the Hardy Hunter shouted--"

1577,FIXING THE BLAME,Compared with his proposed campaign expenses.
1578,FIXING THE BLAME,"You see, Mein Heir, this man was full of guile"
1579,FIXING THE BLAME,And caused the War: this Bey of Oyster Isle.
1580,FIXING THE BLAME,He hypnotized me: put it in my mind
1581,FIXING THE BLAME,To be the Potentate of all Mankind!
1582,FIXING THE BLAME,"So blame me not! The fault I must disown,"
1583,FIXING THE BLAME,And put the guilt on Theodore alone!

1586,FIXING THE BLAME,That _he_ was not impressed to lead my drive

1588,FIXING THE BLAME,"And then, a Marshal, ordered to Paree"
1589,FIXING THE BLAME,To capture it and bring it back to me;
1590,FIXING THE BLAME,"Then take my fleet, the English Channel over"
1591,FIXING THE BLAME,And put King George to rout and bombard Dover;

1625,LOVE'S RECOMPENSE,"""Yes, my Pet! And when Dame Fortune smiles upon us we will wed;"
1626,LOVE'S RECOMPENSE,"I will strew your path with roses: Bear me witness, Gods o'erhead!"""

1628,LOVE'S RECOMPENSE,"And the angels, smiling on him, heard his vow to ""e'er be true."""
1629,LOVE'S RECOMPENSE,Then he placed his arms around her--kissed her: they were in a trance!

1639,ADAM'S ALE,"Come, Comrades, gather 'round the festal board"
1640,ADAM'S ALE,And quaff the sparkling Water from the gourd!
1641,ADAM'S ALE,_This_ is the drink that Adam's Tribe imbibed
1642,ADAM'S ALE,Before the Wines of Gath were diatribed.
1643,ADAM'S ALE,(Methinks some other brand was drunk by Cain
1644,ADAM'S ALE,The day that Abel ruthlessly was slain.)
1645,ADAM'S ALE,"And won, against all other potions there,"
1646,ADAM'S ALE,The First White Ribbon at the Gaza Fair.
1647,ADAM'S ALE,"You'll never know, until you take a sip"
1648,ADAM'S ALE,"Its power to soothe, and cool the fevered lip."
1649,ADAM'S ALE,Had Noah _stuck to_ water he would shine
1650,ADAM'S ALE,As undisputed Master of the Brine.
1651,ADAM'S ALE,"The Water-wagon that he launched, at first"
1652,ADAM'S ALE,Steered Noah straight but didn't cure his thirst:
1653,ADAM'S ALE,So when he _spoke_ the Ararat Café
1654,ADAM'S ALE,"He soon fell off,--his rudder washed away."
1655,ADAM'S ALE,But wallward turn the picture you're beholding
1656,ADAM'S ALE,And hang more cheerful paintings on the moulding!
1657,ADAM'S ALE,Behold a _watercolor_ of eclat!
1658,ADAM'S ALE,"This, fair Rebecca had the skill to _draw_:"
1659,ADAM'S ALE,"She stands beside the well and plies the sweep,"
1660,ADAM'S ALE,While sweat and blushes o'er her features creep.
1661,ADAM'S ALE,"Such grace and poise, such strength and skill,"
1662,ADAM'S ALE,Such sweeping gestures and unbending will
1663,ADAM'S ALE,Are indices of Abstinence complete;
1664,ADAM'S ALE,"(We can't abstain from loving you, Petite!)"
1665,ADAM'S ALE,Upon her head she rests the dripping urn
1666,ADAM'S ALE,And goes straight home: she doesn't _dare_ to turn!
1667,ADAM'S ALE,"Don't stumble, Miss! Or suffer teasing boys"
1668,ADAM'S ALE,To cause derangement of your equipoise!
1669,ADAM'S ALE,But keep your head and waver not at all
1670,ADAM'S ALE,Lest you be deluged by the waterfall!
1671,ADAM'S ALE,So daily to the pool Rebecca strayed
1672,ADAM'S ALE,"And drank the water, when she didn't wade:"
1673,ADAM'S ALE,And thus her framework waxed like iron; I trust
1674,ADAM'S ALE,'Twas ne'er assailed or undermined by rust.
1675,ADAM'S ALE,"So, fill the gourd and pass it to your friend!"
1676,ADAM'S ALE,It's Safety First and safety to the end.
1677,ADAM'S ALE,"No headaches lurk within, no tinge of sorrow,"
1678,ADAM'S ALE,No dark forebodings or remorse to-morrow!
1679,ADAM'S ALE,"And furthermore, it isn't hard to take:"
1680,ADAM'S ALE,"If you've not tried it, _do_, for Mercy's sake!"
1681,ADAM'S ALE,"Behold the Oaken Bucket, hanging high,"
1682,ADAM'S ALE,By Bards and Singers lauded to the sky.
1683,ADAM'S ALE,"It never touched, in all its useful days,"
1684,ADAM'S ALE,A thing but water. Here fair Psyche plays
1685,ADAM'S ALE,Beside the spring that mirrors all her graces.
1686,ADAM'S ALE,(Would you object to _water in_ such cases?)
1687,ADAM'S ALE,Now mark the fate befalling Jack and Jill
1688,ADAM'S ALE,Because they slipped and let the water spill;
1689,ADAM'S ALE,"And see poor Tantalus for water crying,"
1690,ADAM'S ALE,"Thus punished for his sins,--athirst and dying!"
1691,ADAM'S ALE,"And note this ""Titian,"" called ""The Drunkard's Fate,"""
1692,ADAM'S ALE,In which the crimson hues predominate.
1693,ADAM'S ALE,He holds the lamp-post in his close embrace
1694,ADAM'S ALE,And has a package from Pat Murphy's place
1695,ADAM'S ALE,"To carry home. His eyes are red and dim,"
1696,ADAM'S ALE,So close the bar and turn the hose on him!
1697,ADAM'S ALE,"This drink was ever priceless, yet it's free;"
1698,ADAM'S ALE,The Source and Fountain of Sobriety;
1699,ADAM'S ALE,And so we offer without bar or price
1700,ADAM'S ALE,Enough of THIS to put your thirst on ice.
1701,ADAM'S ALE,"So drink to WATER, while the billows swell:"
1702,ADAM'S ALE,The World wants Prohibition--and all's WELL!

1805,EPITAPHS,
1806,EPITAPHS,For forty cents an hour I slaved
1807,EPITAPHS,At Delpont's Powder Mills;

1810,EPITAPHS,
1811,EPITAPHS,Erected to our father is this stone:

2032,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Shall Women vote? Shall Demon Rum survive
2033,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Or be, thru Woman Suffrage, flayed alive?"
2034,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,These are the questions that engross the nation:
2035,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Shall Women vote or be kept on probation?
2036,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Are they not gentle, honest, sweet and kind?"
2037,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"A single missing virtue we can't find,"
2038,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"And yet we say--""Stay home and can the cherries!"
2039,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,You're far too frail and fine for statecraft worries!
2040,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,The Sacred Home for you! Just 'tend your chicks!
2041,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,You'd soil your hands to mix in Politics!
2042,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"And then there's scrubbing, cooking and a few"
2043,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Odd jobs besides: you couldn't ballot _too_!"""
2044,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"But how absurd! Fair Woman, in her wrath,"
2045,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Will make our future course a thorny path:
2046,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Unless we meet her fairly in these matters,"
2047,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"She'll tear our senseless arguments to tatters,"
2048,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"And rule _both_ Home and State to suit herself,"
2049,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Putting deceitful _man_ upon the shelf.
2050,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"As sure as death or taxes, day or night,"
2051,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"She'll have the _vote_ without, or _with_ a fight;"
2052,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"And those of us who counsel Peace, as best,"
2053,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Should not oppose and put her to the test;
2054,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"And when she _gets_ the vote, by force or gift,"
2055,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,The clouds obscuring Temperance will lift;
2056,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"For all the Wets will vanish, ev'ry one!"
2057,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Evaporate like mists before the sun.
2058,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"True, Women drink; it's foolish to deny it!"
2059,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,But not as men do--as a steady diet;
2060,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"They'll take a punch, or sip a little claret,"
2061,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,But when it comes to liquor--they can't bear it.
2062,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,And so we ask again--shall Women vote?
2063,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Shall men surrender to the petticoat
2064,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,And give up all their freedom and their tipples
2065,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Just to return to Lacteal Life and Nipples?
2066,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,The War is on! Nebraska bids defiance
2067,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,To Rum Dispensers and the Booze Alliance:
2068,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Hereafter all our barley, wheat and corn"
2069,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Will be quite unresponsive to the _horn_.
2070,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,The _essence_ of the grain will be tabooed
2071,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,And ev'ry seed accounted for as _food_.
2072,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,No more will Barleycorn assail our vitals
2073,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Or be the Leader in our Song Recitals:
2074,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"No more will Liquor check our ardent thirst,"
2075,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"And so we'll go from bad, perhaps, to worst."
2076,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"If we must _eat_, perforce, and never rum it,"
2077,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,What will befall the man who has to gum it;
2078,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Whose teeth are absent and who food eschews,"
2079,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Drawing his daily nourishment from booze;
2080,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Who can't obtain a single drop of gin
2081,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,To comfort and sustain the man within?
2082,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Pleading for drinks, unheeded he'll grow wheezy,"
2083,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,But he'll improve his breath if he'll Speak Easy.
2084,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"The Drunkard's fate would be a dreadful warning,"
2085,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Who, having ""opened"" Riley's place each morning"
2086,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Found, one cold dawn, the foot-rail gone and read--"
2087,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"""Soft Drinks for Sale"" where Schnapps was sold instead."
2088,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Picture his sorrow! See him pallid grow
2089,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,When told the facts: a spectacle of woe!
2090,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Back to his wife he slinks: he couldn't face her!
2091,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Because he missed his usual ""morning bracer."""
2092,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,The Place is sold: it's now a candy store
2093,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Where Schnapps will be dispensed _with_ evermore.
2094,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Good-bye, Old Demijohn; Decanters, too!"
2095,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,His life will empty be--and so are you!
2096,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Where once the Canteen flourished 'neath our flag,"
2097,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Now Prohibition flags the soldier's jag;
2098,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,And where Josephus keeps his arid log
2099,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,The water-pitcher has succeeded grog.
2100,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Some Commonwealths already have the pluck
2101,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"To ban, humanely, those who _chase the duck_;"
2102,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,And other States have punished Rum enough
2103,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,To have compassion on the _boot-leg_ stuff.
2104,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Thus Prohibition grows: but so does wheat
2105,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,And corn and rye: I wonder which will beat?
2106,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,But what of Woman? Where's her rightful freedom?
2107,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"They ought to have the vote, because we need 'em"
2108,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,To purge our land of drunkenness and crime
2109,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,And save our striplings from the slough and slime.
2110,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Why _shouldn't_ Women vote? Perhaps they may!
2111,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Should Drunkards or Illiterates say nay?
2112,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Could citizens of foreign birth refuse
2113,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,To give our Native Daughters what they choose?
2114,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Our Native Sons with chivalry invoke
2115,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Fair play for women,--freedom from the yoke;"
2116,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,And shouldn't other Freemen rise in flocks
2117,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,To help our Women win the Ballot Box?
2118,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"The trouble lies, not _here_, but with the Bosses"
2119,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Who trade in graft and deal in _double crosses_.
2120,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,The sooner we eliminate this class
2121,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,The quicker will _full freedom_ come to pass.
2122,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"But watch the Anti! Make her hold her tongue,"
2123,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Or duck her in the pond, the geese among;"
2124,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Or lock her in the booth, without a mirror,"
2125,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Where she can't see herself and we can't hear her.
2126,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Thus, neck and neck, these two great questions lead:"
2127,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,Will men be equal to their Country's need?
2128,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"If one Reform upon the other waits,"
2129,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"Speed Equal Suffrage to the White House gates,"
2130,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,
2131,PARAMOUNT PROBLEMS,"And Prohibition (Farewell, Dear old Liquor!)"

3030,DECIMAL POINTS,
3031,DECIMAL POINTS,"The Reader states that Rover, too, was fleet,"
3032,DECIMAL POINTS,And never knew the anguish of de feet;

3034,DECIMAL POINTS,That he could steal a bone and dodge a stick.
3035,DECIMAL POINTS,"That's all the Reader says, but I believe"
3036,DECIMAL POINTS,"He grew too diabetic to retrieve,"
3037,DECIMAL POINTS,And so was cast aside--the poor old brute!
3038,DECIMAL POINTS,Because the mange affected his hirsute;
3039,DECIMAL POINTS,Was driven from the confines of his birth
3040,DECIMAL POINTS,Because not prized: Great Scott! a Kennelworth:

3217,EXCELSIOR,"Upholsterer--marked, USE NO HOOK,"
3218,EXCELSIOR,"Was not curled hair or even moss,"

3225,EXCELSIOR,"But all the ""hair"" was out of sight)."
3226,EXCELSIOR,Excelsior!
3227,EXCELSIOR,
3228,EXCELSIOR,And so Crook sold the lounge or couch
3229,EXCELSIOR,To some poor Boob with gold-filled pouch;
3230,EXCELSIOR,And also sold an easy chair
3231,EXCELSIOR,(The Easy Mark was stuffed for fair.)
3232,EXCELSIOR,Excelsior!
3233,EXCELSIOR,
3234,EXCELSIOR,And thus he plied his artful trade
3235,EXCELSIOR,(A better Craftsman ne'er was made)
3236,EXCELSIOR,"Until the shavings, dyed and curled,"
3237,EXCELSIOR,Resembled hair for all the world.

3241,EXCELSIOR,The way he made his mattresses
3242,EXCELSIOR,Would make a lounging layman sick.
3243,EXCELSIOR,He sold for cash and gave no tick tick--
3244,EXCELSIOR,Excelsior!
3245,EXCELSIOR,

3249,EXCELSIOR,"But all his ""hair"" was cut in Maine--"
3250,EXCELSIOR,Excelsior!
3251,EXCELSIOR,
3252,EXCELSIOR,And then a fire occurred at length
3253,EXCELSIOR,To bolster Crook's financial strength:
3254,EXCELSIOR,The _glue_ that mocked the incensed air
3255,EXCELSIOR,Mistaken was for burning hair;
3256,EXCELSIOR,Excelsior!
3257,EXCELSIOR,
3258,EXCELSIOR,Beware the pine-tree's fibrous heart!

3276,HER,
3277,HER,And so her age is no concern of mine:

3325,THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIVING,When we are _dead_ the recollection stays
3326,THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIVING,"Of virtues only: vices are excused,"

3489,THE COLUMBIAD,That Nature doth provide--loath to deny

3491,THE COLUMBIAD,To us was Freedom's heritage bequeathed
3492,THE COLUMBIAD,To have and hold while life and pride remain:

3496,THE COLUMBIAD,"Who fight against the Despot's ruthless spear,"

3507,THE COLUMBIAD,No life remains: the fields are stark and sere;
3508,THE COLUMBIAD,"The forests, leaf and branch and root, are fled;"
3509,THE COLUMBIAD,The flowers lie trampled on the soldier's bier:

3515,THE COLUMBIAD,The vineyards where the fragrant fruitage hung
3516,THE COLUMBIAD,To cheer the peaceful peasant in his toil

3518,THE COLUMBIAD,Upon the breadth of France's sacred soil.
3519,THE COLUMBIAD,Wrecked are the homesteads: buzzard broods abound
3520,THE COLUMBIAD,"Where shell-holes gape, and heaps of carnage rise"

3528,THE COLUMBIAD,"For Liberty doth in the balance swing,"
3529,THE COLUMBIAD,"And we must guard her, if we fight alone"
3530,THE COLUMBIAD,To rid the world of this malignant _Thing_
3531,THE COLUMBIAD,"That, in the guise of Kultur, hides its hoofs"
3532,THE COLUMBIAD,"And horns, its tail and spear and hideous face,"
3533,THE COLUMBIAD,"And, as a pious priest, on Moslem roofs,"
3534,THE COLUMBIAD,"Extols itself, usurping Allah's place."
3535,THE COLUMBIAD,What blasphemy! Obsessed to germinate
3536,THE COLUMBIAD,"Its propaganda, its infernal cult;"
3537,THE COLUMBIAD,"Condoning Cain's offense, instilling hate,"
3538,THE COLUMBIAD,"It strikes with poison, dirk and catapult"
3539,THE COLUMBIAD,Against the precepts of the Prince of Peace;
3540,THE COLUMBIAD,Against the Conscience of the Universe.
3541,THE COLUMBIAD,"But hatred, lust and war will never cease"
3542,THE COLUMBIAD,Until God's Sword destroys this monstrous curse.
3543,THE COLUMBIAD,Audaciously the Priests of Kultur strive
3544,THE COLUMBIAD,"To spread their doctrine, but the graven god"
3545,THE COLUMBIAD,"Against the Living Christ cannot survive,"
3546,THE COLUMBIAD,And in His time will scourged be with His rod.
3547,THE COLUMBIAD,"And so our Ship of State to battle hastes,"
3548,THE COLUMBIAD,"All sails a-drawing, sheets secure and taut,"
3549,THE COLUMBIAD,"Manned by a stalwart crew, stripped to the waists,"
3550,THE COLUMBIAD,Inspired by battles that our fathers fought.
3551,THE COLUMBIAD,In port at last whence Lafayette once sailed
3552,THE COLUMBIAD,"To aid our fight that made Britannia halt,"
3553,THE COLUMBIAD,They take their stand where Frenchmen never failed
3554,THE COLUMBIAD,To hold the Verdun forts against assault.
3555,THE COLUMBIAD,A mighty effort this! To send our force
3556,THE COLUMBIAD,"Three thousand miles, thru shark-infested sea,"
3557,THE COLUMBIAD,"Beneath dark skies where vultures lay their course,"
3558,THE COLUMBIAD,"To face the foe and ransom Liberty,"
3559,THE COLUMBIAD,Thru sacrificial offering of our sons;
3560,THE COLUMBIAD,"To arm and clothe five million men, and then"
3561,THE COLUMBIAD,"Build, to convey and feed them, countless tons"
3562,THE COLUMBIAD,"Of mighty vessels--transports, merchantmen;"
3563,THE COLUMBIAD,"To furnish, in addition, vast supplies"
3564,THE COLUMBIAD,"To allied Powers whose Cause we have embraced,"
3565,THE COLUMBIAD,To hearten them--to strengthen friendly ties
3566,THE COLUMBIAD,And stay the hand that layeth Europe waste.
3567,THE COLUMBIAD,A task indeed! But let it not be thought
3568,THE COLUMBIAD,By foemen or by those whom we befriend
3569,THE COLUMBIAD,"That Liberty our trust, so dearly bought,"
3570,THE COLUMBIAD,Will not be guarded to the very end.
3571,THE COLUMBIAD,Tho Hercules the Strong should heave in sight

3573,THE COLUMBIAD,We'd enter the arena in our might
3574,THE COLUMBIAD,And win new honors for the Land we serve;
3575,THE COLUMBIAD,For Antaeus and all the myths of old
3576,THE COLUMBIAD,"'Gainst whom the supermen of yore engaged,"
3577,THE COLUMBIAD,"Were never half so mighty, half so bold"
3578,THE COLUMBIAD,"As peaceful freemen, righteously enraged:"
3579,THE COLUMBIAD,And all the modern Bullies who presume
3580,THE COLUMBIAD,"To dominate the world against the Right,"
3581,THE COLUMBIAD,Must see their day-dreams doomed to blackest gloom
3582,THE COLUMBIAD,When Truth prevails against the Imps of Night.
3583,THE COLUMBIAD,So let us fabricate in forge and mill;
3584,THE COLUMBIAD,So let us plant and nurture grain and seed;
3585,THE COLUMBIAD,So let us labor and conserve until
3586,THE COLUMBIAD,There be an end to Kultur's cruel creed.
3587,THE COLUMBIAD,Each one of us must fight or toil or save;
3588,THE COLUMBIAD,_Co-ordination_ be our battle song;
3589,THE COLUMBIAD,Hardships endure and gravest dangers brave
3590,THE COLUMBIAD,If we would victors be and right the wrong.
3591,THE COLUMBIAD,"God's ways to mortal eyes are not revealed,"
3592,THE COLUMBIAD,"But Faith our guidance is thru War's grim task,"
3593,THE COLUMBIAD,And with His help the _Hosts of Sin_ must yield
3594,THE COLUMBIAD,And Satan be denuded of his mask.
