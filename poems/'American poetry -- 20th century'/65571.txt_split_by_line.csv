72,FOREWORD,The great artist is one whose whole body becomes a living soul;
73,FOREWORD,"whose eye gets glimpses into the heart of Nature, with visions of"
74,FOREWORD,"the Supernatural; whose ear hears their inner music, and whose hand"
75,FOREWORD,produces ecstatic expression of their central force in some revelation
76,FOREWORD,"of Beauty. And to make his art more real, more nearly perfect, Beauty"
77,FOREWORD,"more beautiful, such artist by contrast often depicts or suggests the"
78,FOREWORD,deadly but doomed discords of life.

80,FOREWORD,Any inspiring touch I have with Nature makes me less than half content
81,FOREWORD,"with the best I can say of her. Beyond my increasing love for the rich,"
82,FOREWORD,old Mother—yet eternally young and myriad formed—I am deeply indebted
83,FOREWORD,to F. Schuyler Mathews and his charming “Field Book of Wild Birds and
84,FOREWORD,"Their Music,” especially in suggestions and some illustrations for the"
85,FOREWORD,“Birds’ Orchestra.” Other acknowledgements are made elsewhere in this
86,FOREWORD,"little volume of verse, which chances to be my first, and therefore"
87,FOREWORD,subject to the severer criticism.

264,THE DAWN,
265,THE DAWN,"“Start-right, you-hob-bright!” ’Twas fluted so clear,"
266,THE DAWN,"It wakened the songsters and startled my ear,"
267,THE DAWN,
268,THE DAWN,"As the King of the morning repelled the dark night,"
269,THE DAWN,"And the reveille sounded, “All-right! Bob-Bob-White!”"
270,THE DAWN,
271,THE DAWN,"The Mocking-bird earliest answered the call,"
272,THE DAWN,"And gladly his echoes were welcomed by all,"
273,THE DAWN,
274,THE DAWN,"As each took his place in the Nature-trained choir,"
275,THE DAWN,And bird after bird began tuning his lyre.
276,THE DAWN,
277,THE DAWN,"The songsters had started a sweet roundelay,"
278,THE DAWN,When suddenly up bounced a meddlesome Jay.
279,THE DAWN,
280,THE DAWN,"He wanted to sing,"
281,THE DAWN,This feathered thing;
282,THE DAWN,"Or brilliant colors to impress,"
283,THE DAWN,With spontaneous wantonness;
284,THE DAWN,"With spirit too to over-rule,"
285,THE DAWN,Like the self-important fashion fool.
286,THE DAWN,
287,THE DAWN,"In soft monotone crooned the Black-billed Cuckoo,"
288,THE DAWN,"“Tho not much at singing, I’ll surely beat you.”"
289,THE DAWN,
290,THE DAWN,[Illustration: Cat Bird. Photo by the Author.]
291,THE DAWN,
292,THE DAWN,"And Flicker to Jay proclaimed,"
293,THE DAWN,"“_No-cheer_ from me, _no-cheer_!”"
294,THE DAWN,"While the Hooded Warbler, “You-have-no-business-here”!"
295,THE DAWN,
296,THE DAWN,"“I’m a blooming Jay,"
297,THE DAWN,"I’ll have my way,"
298,THE DAWN,Dj-a-y! dj-a-y! dj-a-y!”
299,THE DAWN,
300,THE DAWN,"Then spoke that brave bird, the yellow-breast Chat:"
301,THE DAWN,“Cop! Cop! Shut-him-in-prison-and-send-for-the-cat.”
302,THE DAWN,
303,THE DAWN,"And King bird commanded with spirit irate,"
304,THE DAWN,"“Away with you, Blue Jay—or I’ll pounce on your pate.”"
305,THE DAWN,
306,THE DAWN,"And the Jay slipped away,"
307,THE DAWN,"With a sure word of peace,"
308,THE DAWN,For such glad release:
309,THE DAWN,“Ge-rul-lup!
310,THE DAWN,Jig’s-all-up!”
311,THE DAWN,
312,THE DAWN,[Illustration: YOUNG SCREECH OWL. Photo by Rev. Wallace Rogers.]
313,THE DAWN,
314,THE DAWN,"Then Wisdom’s proud bird, that old mystical fake,"
315,THE DAWN,"While breakfasting late on a daring young snake,"
316,THE DAWN,
317,THE DAWN,"Cried “Boo to y-o-u, hoot for y-o-u! Who-whoo—are-y-o-u?”"
318,THE DAWN,Till down in my heart I felt humbled anew.
319,THE DAWN,
320,THE DAWN,But hope was revived by an echo of Night—
321,THE DAWN,For Night has her echoes and pledges of Light—
322,THE DAWN,
323,THE DAWN,"“You can, if you will, a high mission fulfill.”"
324,THE DAWN,Insistently whistled the lone Whip-poor-will.
325,THE DAWN,
326,THE DAWN,Then all grew still
327,THE DAWN,O’er vale and hill
328,THE DAWN,And the echo came back:
329,THE DAWN,"“You can, if you will.”"
330,THE DAWN,
331,THE DAWN,The sun poured forth his flood of pure gold
332,THE DAWN,"On Nature’s great chorister birdlings of old,"
333,THE DAWN,
334,THE DAWN,When wide circling throngs made the welkin resound
335,THE DAWN,"With the liveliest chatter, “Let joy go round.”"
336,THE DAWN,
337,THE DAWN,"Then flashed through the air a ruby tinged light,"
338,THE DAWN,Like an arrow of glory soon lost to my sight.
339,THE DAWN,
340,THE DAWN,"When lo! it returned—a bird that ne’er sings,"
341,THE DAWN,Though his music is borne in the hum of his wings:
342,THE DAWN,
343,THE DAWN,"“I fly, yet rest,"
344,THE DAWN,"In swiftest quest,"
345,THE DAWN,"Of flowers best,"
346,THE DAWN,"With their sweetest, nectared off’rings.”"
347,THE DAWN,
348,THE DAWN,[Illustration: HUMMING BIRD. By F. Schuyler Matthews.]
349,THE DAWN,
350,THE DAWN,"And my heart sang out with a jubilant cry,"
351,THE DAWN,“O for poise and feasting in tension so high.”
352,THE DAWN,
353,THE DAWN,"While the Humming bird sipped his choicest wine,"
354,THE DAWN,The musicians came to a sudden pause;
355,THE DAWN,Each singer’s eye was a-gaze like mine—
356,THE DAWN,And the wonder of bird-land received their applause.
357,THE DAWN,
358,THE DAWN,"The fun-makers followed, the gay Bobolinks,"
359,THE DAWN,With comical solo and musical kinks!
360,THE DAWN,
361,THE DAWN,"“You’d better think,"
362,THE DAWN,"Flippant Chewink,"
363,THE DAWN,"’Tis the finest of sport,”"
364,THE DAWN,Sang Bobolink.
365,THE DAWN,
366,THE DAWN,"And said Bob, “Be true to me, be true to me;"
367,THE DAWN,"Kick your slipper, kick your slipper;[2]"
368,THE DAWN,Be true to me—old Nick’s the whipper!”
369,THE DAWN,
370,THE DAWN,"And over the pond, on bending cat-tails,"
371,THE DAWN,"The red-shouldered Black-birds were piping their gales,"
372,THE DAWN,
373,THE DAWN,"As they swung to and fro with a blithe “Con-quer-ee,”"
374,THE DAWN,"And their mates made reply—“O’er-the-lea, come-to-me!”"
375,THE DAWN,
376,THE DAWN,"From the Meadow-lark’s throat came a livelier strain,"
377,THE DAWN,“All hail to the bridegroom and those in his train;
378,THE DAWN,
379,THE DAWN,"“And greet the fair bride in her gay-feathered veil,"
380,THE DAWN,She’ll build a snug nest for the babies—all hail!”
381,THE DAWN,
382,THE DAWN,"From Oriole there, like a glad whistling boy,"
383,THE DAWN,Came fragments of melody thrilling with joy:
384,THE DAWN,
385,THE DAWN,“I sing as I work—
386,THE DAWN,This vantage men shirk—
387,THE DAWN,And music I blend
388,THE DAWN,With care of the children and house that I tend.”
389,THE DAWN,
390,THE DAWN,"Then on came the Finches in rollicking glee,"
391,THE DAWN,With Grosbeak and Chippy and plaintive Pewee;
392,THE DAWN,
393,THE DAWN,"And every one’s note rang as clear as a bell,"
394,THE DAWN,With the swing of love’s passion and deep growing spell.
395,THE DAWN,
396,THE DAWN,“Per-chick-o-ree!
397,THE DAWN,"Now, don’t you see"
398,THE DAWN,The song in me
399,THE DAWN,Is ecstasy?”
400,THE DAWN,
401,THE DAWN,"Thus jingled the Goldfinch in musical run,"
402,THE DAWN,As he dipped up and down in the waves of the sun;
403,THE DAWN,
404,THE DAWN,"Like golden-robed, sable winged fairy he flew"
405,THE DAWN,Across his wide world of cerulean blue.

407,THE DAWN,[Illustration: WHITE THROATED SPARROWS. Photo by the Author.]
408,THE DAWN,
409,THE DAWN,[2] As heard by John Burroughs.
410,THE DAWN,
411,THE DAWN,"The White throated Sparrow, a provident bird,"
412,THE DAWN,Revealed deepest wisdom in simplest word;
413,THE DAWN,
414,THE DAWN,"“Sow wheat and sow plenty—oh yes, sow a plenty,"
415,THE DAWN,Though Peverly’s small he has hunger of twenty.”
416,THE DAWN,
417,THE DAWN,"“When the granary’s full, and reapers go feastin’,"
418,THE DAWN,"I’ll cheer you ag’in, with my fiddle-in’, fiddle-in’,"
419,THE DAWN,"The long hours through, a-fiddle-in’, fiddle-in’.”[3]"
420,THE DAWN,
421,THE DAWN,"A versatile singer, an artist o’er shy,"
422,THE DAWN,Now uplifted his voice to his Maker on high.
423,THE DAWN,
424,THE DAWN,No pause in the rhythm of the Song Sparrow’s lay;
425,THE DAWN,And I pondered and wondered as on flew the day:
426,THE DAWN,“Is this high Art’s way?”
427,THE DAWN,
428,THE DAWN,"While still rolled his “swee-e-t, swee-e-t, bitter”—[4]"
429,THE DAWN,"The philosophy of life, from a plain, little flitter."
430,THE DAWN,
431,THE DAWN,"Pond’ring I lingered and forgot me to eat,"
432,THE DAWN,A captive held fast in fair Nature’s retreat.

436,THE DAWN,"[3] This repeated paraphrase is from F. Schuyler Mathews, ornithologist"
437,THE DAWN,and musician.
438,THE DAWN,
439,THE DAWN,[4] The words suggested to John Burroughs by the variations of the Song
440,THE DAWN,Sparrow.
441,THE DAWN,
442,THE DAWN,"The Oven-bird graceful, misnamed “the preacher,”"
443,THE DAWN,"Proudly sang out, “I’m-a-teacher, a TEACHER;”"
444,THE DAWN,
445,THE DAWN,"And Maryland Yellow-throat piped, “What a pity,"
446,THE DAWN,"You can’t sing a sweet, old-fashioned ditty!"
447,THE DAWN,What a pity!”
448,THE DAWN,
449,THE DAWN,From the wayside just then came a mocking “meow;”
450,THE DAWN,"“If the rest of you follow, I’ll join in the row;"
451,THE DAWN,
452,THE DAWN,“And why not now?
453,THE DAWN,A fuss somehow—
454,THE DAWN,"Meow, meow!”"
455,THE DAWN,
456,THE DAWN,"But lo! the voice softened and turned to a tune,"
457,THE DAWN,Repeating the bird’s notes that glad day in June.
458,THE DAWN,
459,THE DAWN,With soft-flowing accent the good Chickadee
460,THE DAWN,"Said “dear me,” and added a sweet “amity.”"

462,THE DAWN,[Illustration: YOUNG MALE CARDINAL TRYING TO LIGHT ON BOUQUET OF

464,THE DAWN,
465,THE DAWN,"And Blue-Bird’s grave “purity,” Robin’s gay “cheer”"
466,THE DAWN,Were songs as delightful as lovers may hear;
467,THE DAWN,
468,THE DAWN,"While Red-headed Woodpecker, ever after his rum,"
469,THE DAWN,Kept beating and beating his sweet tree drum.
470,THE DAWN,
471,THE DAWN,"The Cardinal came with his bright crimson crest,"
472,THE DAWN,And sang for his bride as she fashioned her nest;
473,THE DAWN,
474,THE DAWN,"But Toxaway’s[5] rival gave forth the echo,"
475,THE DAWN,"“Kid-dów, Kid-dów, Kid-dów!”"
476,THE DAWN,
477,THE DAWN,"Now list to the out-flow from the topmost tree,"
478,THE DAWN,Coming down from the Thrasher in perfect frenzy;
479,THE DAWN,
480,THE DAWN,"The birds and I marvelled as he swept on alone,"
481,THE DAWN,"Now high, and now low, now a thrilled overtone."
482,THE DAWN,
483,THE DAWN,[Illustration: THRASHER’S ADMIRATION. Photo by Author.]
484,THE DAWN,
485,THE DAWN,"And lo! just then,"
486,THE DAWN,"A voice—a Wren,"
487,THE DAWN,"From a fern-lit glen,"
488,THE DAWN,
489,THE DAWN,"Burst forth like a rippling fountain of life,"
490,THE DAWN,Rebuking old Mars with his death-dealing strife;
491,THE DAWN,
492,THE DAWN,"And it seemed that I caught for the sons of men,"
493,THE DAWN,The lost chord of an angel in the song of the Wren.
494,THE DAWN,
495,THE DAWN,Discord now from birds as black as night:
496,THE DAWN,“Caw! Caw! Caw!”
497,THE DAWN,"Screamed a full score,"
498,THE DAWN,"Or even more,"
499,THE DAWN,
500,THE DAWN,Till stones by me hurled put them all to flight.
501,THE DAWN,
502,THE DAWN,"Again was felt a pause, a silence deep,"
503,THE DAWN,"When four of the feathered friends who copy song,"
504,THE DAWN,"Were planning fain their secret, potent word,"
505,THE DAWN,Worthy of the wisest of mankind;
506,THE DAWN,The proud quartette then took the airy stage:

562,TWILIGHT,"But ho! Presto-“Bob-White! Bob, Bob-White!”"
563,TWILIGHT,“I announced the morn and now the night.”
564,TWILIGHT,
565,TWILIGHT,"Bestirred in the gloaming by Bob-White’s last call,"
566,TWILIGHT,I awakened to music the sweetest of all.
567,TWILIGHT,
568,TWILIGHT,The flutelike peals of the Thrush of the wood
569,TWILIGHT,Still bound me to the world of angelhood.
570,TWILIGHT,
571,TWILIGHT,"But the depths of my soul had the holiest hush,"

573,TWILIGHT,
574,TWILIGHT,"He climbed to the heights where I too would arise,"
575,TWILIGHT,But no one may soar with that pride of the skies.
576,TWILIGHT,

578,TWILIGHT,Why experience birds such wonderful bliss?”
579,TWILIGHT,
580,TWILIGHT,"My soul was on fire,"
581,TWILIGHT,"From Nature’s great choir,"
582,TWILIGHT,As the glad mounting symphony

650,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,Pray give me thine.

652,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"Some secrets sweet are mine, but oh how few,"
653,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,Compared to richest bounty which must be
654,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,In thy pure heart and home—why not my due?
655,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,Will I some day find hid thy mystic key?
656,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,Lead on thou me.
657,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,
658,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"My youthful joys and heights of yester-year,"
659,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"Were bright and buoyant, satisfying then;"
660,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,But they have gone for aye. More calls I hear;
661,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,They charm me onward to some larger ken;
662,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"But, O Truth, when?"
663,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,
664,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"If all I may not know, then serve will I,"
665,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"Submissive to each load and yoke thou givest,"
666,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"Like the plaintless, faithful ox, without a sigh;"
667,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"But soon I plead: “I poorly live; thou richly livest,"
668,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,And oft receivest

670,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,“Me for some higher service still—but where?
671,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,For whom? Why serve and not be satisfied?
672,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"Why toil on land and sea, and burdens bear,"
673,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,Without thy joy? O be my willing bride!”
674,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,My poor heart cried.
675,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,
676,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"And lo, I saw encaged a joy-filled bird,"
677,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"And one a-wing in song, as blithe as free;"
678,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"A cooing babe I caught, in love preferred—"
679,MY PRAYER TO TRUTH,"Knowledge, service, song, O Truth, found me;"

873,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
874,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"O little artist, of rarest modesty,"
875,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Why hide thyself and sing?
876,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Thy music fills my soul with ecstasy,"
877,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],And makes the woodland ring.
878,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
879,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Draw near, draw near, thou shy, yet happy one;"
880,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],I plead with thee—draw near;
881,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],I’d share thy rapture; ’twould be heaven begun;
882,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"O Hermit sweet, appear."
883,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
884,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Still thou wilt not, and while I long and dream"
885,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Of all that’s best for us—
886,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"The King, His primal ministers—what gleam"
887,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Of highest genius?
888,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
889,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Sing on, elusive bird, in thy retreat,"
890,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Songs to my waiting soul;
891,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Some day inviting rounds will be complete,"
892,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Some day, the promised goal."
893,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
894,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"And then some disappearing portion high,"
895,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Some joy just out of reach;
896,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"The more immortals yield to devotion’s tie,"
897,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],The more must they beseech.
898,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
899,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Sing on, blest bird, beyond my poor purview,"
900,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],But near my home and heart:
901,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"“I love, I _love_, I LOVE; yes I love YOU!”[8]"
902,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"This, thy crescendo art."
903,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
904,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"I find myself quite charmed, yet almost lost,"
905,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],At the modern opera grand;
906,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"What stirs my soul so deep, what I love most,"
907,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Thy song—and I understand.
908,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
909,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],But O that I could see thy beaming eye—
910,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Mine eye on thee, all song!"
911,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Why so secretive, yet seductive—why?"
912,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"My suit, renewed, so strong."

917,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Aflame with joy that bower.
918,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
919,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Such rich and rounded notes proceed from thee,"
920,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Enchanting naiveté:
921,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"From sleep thou wakest me with highborn glee,"
922,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],When comes the King of day.
923,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
924,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"At eventide thou callest me to prayer,"
925,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"More clear than churchly chime,"
926,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"In wood and sky, in pure, perfumed air—"
927,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"His temple, thine and mine."
928,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
929,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"No passing wonder, sing Nightingales"
930,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],In Russ or Tuscan clime;
931,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],No hope have they in these Columbic vales
932,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],To match thy tones and time.
933,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
934,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],[7] If anyone thinks the author has overdrawn the artistic merits of
935,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"the bird, he is referred to the expert opinion of F. Schuyler Mathews"
936,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"in his “Field Book of Wild Birds and Their Music,” pages 234-246,"
937,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],wherein this musician and lover of birds convincingly compares and
938,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"contrasts, by musical scales and other data, the powers of the Hermit"

947,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],To thirsting souls and worn;
948,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Like evening’s changing charms, no artist’s hand"
949,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Can set in painted bourn;
950,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
951,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Like sweetest dreams to troubled hearts in slumbers,"
952,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Uplift to heaven’s heights—
953,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Just so thy symphonies, heard in rolling numbers,"
954,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Thy high and holy flights.
955,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
956,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"O anchoret, near Nature’s heart, again"

959,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Now gone on gentle wing.

961,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"My eye too piercing, and my quest too keen,"
962,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Unfathomable bird.
963,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Once more contented I—remain unseen,"
964,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],And yet thy harmony heard.
965,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
966,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"This I have found, as fast thou holdeth me:"
967,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Thou startest full, and risest;"
968,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"And all doth thrill—sweet, moving melody,"
969,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Climbing to the highest.
970,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
971,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"No pipe, no flute, organ or organist,"
972,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Can reach thine allegro,"
973,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"And thy cadenza, thou transcendentalist—"
974,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],’Tis music with naught of woe.
975,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
976,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Whence come from singers proud their hard-won notes?
977,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"In truth from the music master,"
978,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],By repetition oft and untrained throats—
979,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"To hearers, near disaster."
980,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],
981,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"The master’s whence, the singing pioneer,"
982,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],Great Haydn or Beethoven?
983,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Sing on, my thrilling thrush, but wilt thou hear?"
984,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"From thee, and thou from Heaven!"

986,THE HERMIT THRUSH[7],"Long hours I’ve listened lone, in deep delight,"

1159,THE JAY AND I—A DIALOGUE,"“’Tis true, Blue Jay, but too much pride;"

1284,A NIGGER AND A MULE,
1285,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"I’ve lived in the city, I’ve sailed the wide sea;"
1286,A NIGGER AND A MULE,I’ve studied in many and many a school;
1287,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"I’ve sat at the feet of the bond and free,"
1288,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"And a lot has come to a fellow like me,"
1289,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"Since a new ground I plowed with a balky mule,"
1290,A NIGGER AND A MULE,But I’ve lived to see balky and a nigger fool.
1291,A NIGGER AND A MULE,
1292,A NIGGER AND A MULE,No deep-seated scorn of the African fool—
1293,A NIGGER AND A MULE,There’s plenty like him from the hills to the sea;
1294,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"’Tis the union of nigger and a stubborn mule,"
1295,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"That surpasses the sport of an all-round school,"
1296,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"If not for professor for fun-loving me,"
1297,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"And as long as I’m playful, my play shall be free."
1298,A NIGGER AND A MULE,
1299,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"Aye friend, ’tis a wonderful thing to be free,"
1300,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"Though many a free man I’d call a fool,"
1301,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"And no doubt some of them would thus entitle me,"
1302,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"Though tutored in the city, the college and the sea"
1303,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"Yet the nigger and hybrid, I’d take for a school;"
1304,A NIGGER AND A MULE,For ’tis hard to beat a pure nigger and a mule.
1305,A NIGGER AND A MULE,
1306,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"But a “coon” in new ground, with a kicking mule!"
1307,A NIGGER AND A MULE,Just so I am far from his heels and am free
1308,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"To look, and to listen like a pupil in school;"
1309,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"Though frankly I admit, I at times played the fool,"
1310,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"Till the lessons of life had widened my sea,"
1311,A NIGGER AND A MULE,And harder experience had deepened me.
1312,A NIGGER AND A MULE,
1313,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"Ye fates, do not bring the worst unto me,"
1314,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"That of trying to handle a nondescript mule,"
1315,A NIGGER AND A MULE,In a rooty new ground—O the depths of the sea
1316,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"I’d choose, in the hope with the fish to be free;"
1317,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"However, such choosing would prove me a fool—"
1318,A NIGGER AND A MULE,No applicant I for a sea-bottom school.
1319,A NIGGER AND A MULE,
1320,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"Since I’ve come to think, ’twas a German-tried school;"
1321,A NIGGER AND A MULE,And a submarine ship was never for me;
1322,A NIGGER AND A MULE,And the proudest old Hun thus out-reached the fool.
1323,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"But behold, you elect, a nigger and a mule,"
1324,A NIGGER AND A MULE,In new ground in August—thank God I am free!
1325,A NIGGER AND A MULE,I’m only a witness on a smoother sea.
1326,A NIGGER AND A MULE,
1327,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"God bless his wide sea, and the nigger in school;"
1328,A NIGGER AND A MULE,And all men make free—’twould be heaven for me—
1329,A NIGGER AND A MULE,"And God bless the poor mule, and the mule-headed fool."

4117,THE AEOLIAN HARP,"My soul is at peace, yet longs for more,"
4118,THE AEOLIAN HARP,"More of such wooing of the eternally tender goddess,"
4119,THE AEOLIAN HARP,"Brought to me, with approval of Aeolius."

4123,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,
4124,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"I answered truly with both heart and head,"
4125,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"“Not guilty” of the things _they_ said,"
4126,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"My plotting foes, with envy’s cruel rod;"
4127,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"Yet frailties mine oppressively controlled,"
4128,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"And perilous waves o’er me were rolled,"
4129,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,When lo! a symbol of the meek but mighty God.
4130,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"Again I saw and loved the sinner’s Friend,"
4131,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,From first missteps to abysmal depths of his darkest end—
4132,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"A friend to even me, a crushed clod."
4133,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,
4134,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"But how, O Jesus, how"
4135,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"Can a stainless one, the such as thou,"
4136,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,Again receive a sinner like myself?
4137,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"With weakened faith in thee, with pride and pelf"
4138,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"I went my way,"
4139,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,And leaned for stay
4140,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,On feigned things that fell;
4141,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"And down I dropped to hell,"
4142,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"A bitter burning hell,"
4143,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"A hell of fire, consuming fire within,"
4144,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,In a mind and heart of sin—
4145,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"A fire which broke out all around,"
4146,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,Because the flame in me was found—
4147,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,For in the human heart doth heaven and hell begin.
4148,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,
4149,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"But I willed, not in such a state to dwell,"
4150,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"If, O Christ, I may return,"
4151,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,And once more learn
4152,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,The power of thy love and grace.
4153,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"While I may not behold the glory of thy face,"
4154,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"I only ask to see and to adore,"
4155,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"As many a penitent and I afore,"
4156,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"The prints of spear and nail which with utmost woe were driven,"
4157,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,Till thy life and all thy matchless wealth were given
4158,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"For captive and vexed sinners like to me,"
4159,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"To set them free,"
4160,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,In hope of peace and heaven.
4161,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,
4162,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"Since that awful day the changing seasons have faster flown,"
4163,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,And what must I to men make known?
4164,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,After the passing of two thousand years
4165,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"Of man’s bravest fights, greatest victories and fears,"
4166,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"With ofttimes self-imposed torment and tears,"
4167,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,Thy transcendent heights for me are more increased—
4168,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"Thou savest me, the very least."
4169,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,
4170,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,Thou ancient and invisible I Am
4171,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"Art one with Heaven’s youthful, adorable Lamb,"
4172,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,For looking by faith behind the veil I see
4173,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"The cross still piercing through thy very heart,"
4174,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,Thy great salvation to impart;
4175,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,And herein I’ll glory eternally.
4176,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"Accept my life and this my final, whole-hearted word,"
4177,THE GOD-MAN AND MYSELF,"O ever living, ever loving, most glorious Lord."
