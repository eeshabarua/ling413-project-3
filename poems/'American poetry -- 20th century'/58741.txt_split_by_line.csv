53,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
54,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"When you gave me a painting of hammocks,"
55,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I knew:
56,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
57,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"The dreamer tells the truth, the self awake"
58,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,does not.
59,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
60,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,For years I raged against the images
61,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,you drew.
62,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
63,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"How they stared, gloomy shrouds, whenever I"
64,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,forgot.
65,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
66,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"To rest, be still--I swore that was a way"
67,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of death.
68,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
69,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Yet find more lives in sleep than I have years
70,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,ahead.

117,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP
118,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
119,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
120,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
121,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"It is a house with many doors,"
122,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,no two alike.
123,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
124,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I am at home in all its rooms
125,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of time and place.
126,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
127,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"My changing person, gender, speech"
128,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,hold no surprise.
129,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
130,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I know who I am in my sleep,"
131,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,behind my face.
132,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
133,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,If you ask which of them is false
134,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and which is true
135,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
136,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Enter the house with me and call,"
137,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I'll answer you.
138,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
139,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
140,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
141,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
142,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Here inside the darkness,"
143,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the eye of light opens
144,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
145,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,As mind travels inward
146,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to a fourth dimension.
147,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
148,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,There is no perspective
149,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of other or outside.
150,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
151,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Both obverse and reverse
152,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,are simultaneous
153,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
154,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,While past and present form
155,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,a folding wave that flows
156,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
157,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Now backward, then forward"
158,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,in one eternal dream.
159,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
160,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
161,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
162,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
163,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I found it as a child,"
164,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,a house that was all mine
165,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
166,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Where I could think and be
167,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,whatever I believed.
168,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
169,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Half of me stayed outside
170,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"on guard, aware of spies"
171,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
172,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,The inner self went free
173,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to wonder as it pleased.
174,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
175,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Leaving the day behind,"
176,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I came upon the night
177,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
178,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,And there I dreamed of things
179,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,past all imagining.
180,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
181,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
182,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
183,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
184,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Memory is no stranger
185,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,in the house of sleep.
186,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
187,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,It comes as a visitor
188,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,for a reunion.
189,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
190,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"If a private occasion,"
191,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,with the family
192,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
193,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Or else with those forgotten
194,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,who have long been gone.
195,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
196,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,The waiting house is ready
197,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,for us to gather.
198,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
199,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Together or separately
200,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,our memories meet.
201,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
202,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
203,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
204,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
205,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Waking in the night,"
206,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I have wondered where I am
207,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
208,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Knowing I have been away
209,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and not yet returned.
210,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
211,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I lie still and wait
212,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,between absence and presence
213,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
214,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Conscious of being witness
215,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to my sleep and wake.
216,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
217,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Here's body, inert,"
218,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,prepared to revert to clay.
219,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
220,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"O wanderer with my lamp,"
221,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,how dim grows the light.
222,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
223,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
224,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
225,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
226,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Flying effortlessly
227,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I escape gravity
228,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
229,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"And seaborne, breathe through gills"
230,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to swim past coral isles
231,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
232,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Where I emerge on shores
233,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,that climb up ancient roads.
234,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
235,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Always, my origins"
236,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,enact some past within
237,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
238,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Recalling elements
239,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of former existence.
240,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
241,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Save two, that I renounce:"
242,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"bloodrust fire, fleshtorn ground."
243,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
244,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
245,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
246,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
247,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Here I need no clock
248,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to tell me what time it is.
249,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
250,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"The day, season, year"
251,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,conform to no calendar.
252,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
253,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,No compass or map
254,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,points my route or direction.
255,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
256,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Sensation is all:
257,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the shape and sound of feeling.
258,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
259,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I learn what I think
260,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"by choice of symbols, meanings."
261,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
262,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I invent my world
263,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,as much as it invents me.
264,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
265,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
266,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
267,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
268,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,A baton like a pendulum
269,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,swings back and forth.
270,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
271,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Across the universe it moves
272,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,in perfect time
273,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
274,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Leading an orchestra of stars
275,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,through measured space.
276,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
277,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"A score arranged with such grandeur,"
278,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I merely hear
279,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
280,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Its echoes through the walls of sleep--
281,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"how faint, how far"
282,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
283,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,While my heart beats to the rhythm
284,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of earth's passage.
285,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
286,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
287,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
288,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
289,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,The twelve hours of the night
290,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,are paths between the stars.
291,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
292,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Whichever one you take
293,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,leads to this centered house
294,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
295,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,If you speak the password
296,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to those who guard the gates.
297,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
298,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,You must not look at them
299,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,or touch them on the way
300,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
301,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Lest you be left alone
302,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and hear the triple bark.
303,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
304,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"For the rest, safe journey"
305,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and sweet dreams until dawn.
306,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
307,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
308,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
309,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
310,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,How the bedtime refrain still echoes
311,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,through the house:
312,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
313,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"""Good night, sweet dreams, see you tomorrow."""
314,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Was it wish
315,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
316,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Or something more substantial for child
317,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to sleep on
318,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
319,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Like a pillow filled throughout the night
320,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,with promise?
321,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
322,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Which was kept and shall be kept in years
323,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,yet to come
324,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
325,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"When all the yesterdays that made me,"
326,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,wake at dawn.
327,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
328,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
329,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
330,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
331,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,In genesis the dream began
332,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and came to life
333,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
334,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"By dividing the form from void,"
335,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the dark from light
336,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
337,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"And parting the sea from dry land,"
338,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,mother from child
339,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
340,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Gave image its own reflection
341,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,by day and night
342,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
343,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,But kept the sleeping and waking
344,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,for seem and like
345,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
346,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,That the timeless and undying
347,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,remain in-sight.
348,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
349,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
350,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
351,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
352,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Our dreamscape is a Mil Cumbres
353,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,across the years.
354,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
355,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Peak after peak they rise like crests
356,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,above a sea
357,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
358,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"In which we plunge, swim, dive and drown"
359,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,beneath each wave.
360,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
361,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Yet breath returns and eyes grow clear
362,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,from time to time
363,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
364,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"As all stands still, becalmed, at rest,"
365,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and we can see
366,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
367,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"There, where we were.  Here, where we are."
368,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,How far.  Which way.
369,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
370,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
371,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
372,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
373,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,It was a garden of people
374,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,at all seasons.
375,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
376,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I saw hands at work everywhere,"
377,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,none of them still.
378,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
379,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Some were planting new souls
380,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,in the fresh earth.
381,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
382,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Others went about the weeding,"
383,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"pruning, hoeing"
384,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
385,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Their baskets filled with human plants
386,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of every kind.
387,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
388,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"While leaves, endless leaves kept falling"
389,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,all around me.
390,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
391,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
392,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
393,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
394,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Among the Joshua trees,"
395,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I saw a stone cross
396,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
397,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Both claiming world salvation
398,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"from brush, sand and thorn"
399,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
400,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"While I stood on a mountain,"
401,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,waiting for the ark
402,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
403,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"To save me from destruction,"
404,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,drowned by floods of sun.
405,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
406,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,But the fiery waves rose up
407,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,forty days and nights
408,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
409,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,And there was not a sign of
410,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"clouds, and no dove came."
411,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
412,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
413,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
414,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
415,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,A bird stopped me
416,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,as I started to walk across.
417,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
418,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"""You can not enter the circle,"
419,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"you have no wings."""
420,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
421,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,So I went back
422,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and I looked for them on the earth.
423,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
424,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,But none of all the winged insects
425,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,knew where mine were.
426,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
427,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,So I went on
428,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and I looked for them in the sea.
429,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
430,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,And the fish told me of angels
431,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,who looked like birds.
432,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
433,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
434,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
435,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
436,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"With this ring I thee wed,"
437,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"said the moon, said the earth."
438,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
439,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I saw it overhead,"
440,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,a crystal band of ice
441,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
442,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Through which the eye of God
443,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,bore witness once again
444,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
445,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,To living light and love
446,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,within the cosmic void.
447,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
448,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I heard the vows exchanged
449,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,between the cold and dark
450,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
451,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Then with my own, warm breath"
452,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I wed the night and slept.
453,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
454,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
455,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
456,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
457,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Through the mirror and through the fog,"
458,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,all things reverse.
459,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
460,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I see the right side on the left,"
461,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"the left side, right."
462,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
463,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I see the shapes of what has been
464,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"behind, transposed."
465,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
466,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,A camera floats above my head
467,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,as dreams submerge.
468,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
469,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,A shadow moves beyond my feet
470,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,in backward stride.
471,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
472,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"The mirror and the fog are one,"
473,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"and I, enclosed."
474,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
475,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
476,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
477,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
478,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,What was the Eskimo
479,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,doing in the tropics?
480,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
481,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,What was the Hottentot
482,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,doing in the arctic?
483,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
484,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Caught between the two,"
485,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I asked what choice was mine?
486,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
487,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Having to freeze or burn,"
488,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I felt, was too extreme."
489,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
490,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Yet heart elected south
491,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and brain elected north
492,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
493,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Since a temperate zone
494,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,in heaven was no more.
495,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
496,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
497,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
498,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
499,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I wanted to lift
500,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the poor and ignorant soul
501,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
502,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"To feed and clothe it,"
503,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to give it eyes and ears.
504,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
505,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I led it away
506,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"from hunger, cold and terror"
507,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
508,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Helping it to climb,"
509,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to trust my choice of freedom.
510,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
511,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"But when I let go,"
512,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the peak opened with wide jaws
513,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
514,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"For the slip, the fall--"
515,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"and I grabbed the soul, and ran."
516,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
517,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
518,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
519,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
520,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"What shall I be,"
521,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I asked of Tarot cards and stars
522,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
523,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,That I might live
524,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"as fits my tastes, beliefs and cares?"
525,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
526,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"First, be a prince,"
527,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"with pleasures, treasures, all desires."
528,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
529,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Then, be a priest,"
530,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,with holy thoughts of love divine.
531,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
532,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Third, a peasant,"
533,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,with simple needs and natural ways.
534,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
535,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Last, as poet,"
536,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,combine the three--or curse your fate.
537,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
538,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
539,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
540,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
541,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,It looked like a mountain
542,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,with garden terraces
543,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
544,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,A holiday setting
545,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and dazzling in sunshine
546,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
547,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Where one could be at ease
548,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to stroll and meet old friends
549,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
550,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Exploring all the paths
551,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,unhurried by the years
552,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
553,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Feeling the light within
554,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,increase with heightened joy
555,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
556,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,While going up and on
557,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,from terrace to terrace.
558,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
559,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
560,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
561,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
562,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I went down
563,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,into the vaults of time's library
564,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
565,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Down through sunless, airless corridors"
566,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,staffed by ghosts.
567,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
568,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Down the winding halls and cobbled stairs
569,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,daubed with earth
570,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
571,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Past the rows
572,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of book graves in a cemetery
573,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
574,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Of old words,"
575,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"until I came to the last, first one"
576,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
577,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"When I heard a rumble, saw a flash"
578,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and woke dumb.
579,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
580,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
581,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
582,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
583,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I followed God
584,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,until he stopped at a crossroads.
585,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
586,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,On the one side
587,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,was a cliff high above the sea.
588,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
589,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"On the other,"
590,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,a dense woods baited with summer.
591,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
592,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Future unknown,"
593,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I asked which way was I to go?
594,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
595,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"He pointed left,"
596,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,where the sun bowed low in the west.
597,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
598,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"And God, I asked?"
599,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"To the right, he said and vanished."
600,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
601,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
602,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
603,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
604,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,It was a long road through a fog
605,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,that swirled like clouds
606,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
607,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"And many were going with me,"
608,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"behind, ahead"
609,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
610,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Though no one spoke or stopped, moved past"
611,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,or turned aside.
612,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
613,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"But when we reached the edge of time,"
614,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I grew afraid
615,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
616,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Until one found me there and smiled
617,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and took my hand
618,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
619,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Then led me step by step again,"
620,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,a little child.
621,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
622,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
623,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
624,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
625,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"First, the night came to me"
626,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,in the shape of a moth.
627,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
628,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"With a soft flick like breath,"
629,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,its wing-tips grazed my head.
630,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
631,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Then, from a hollow tree,"
632,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,a hoot owl mourned its cry
633,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
634,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"And as I turned to look,"
635,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I thought the moon turned, too."
636,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
637,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Beyond the road, a skunk."
638,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Within my room, a rose."
639,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
640,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"So I sat up, I think,"
641,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,while the night spoke and spoke.
642,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
643,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
644,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
645,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
646,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I hear the word incessantly
647,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,as a chorus
648,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
649,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,A word whose voices are composed
650,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of all my years
651,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
652,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Like a requiem long rehearsed
653,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,in every key
654,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
655,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"And begun the day of my birth,"
656,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,inside of me
657,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
658,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,A word sung for my soul's repose
659,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,while I am here
660,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
661,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"An earthling, bent on a journey"
662,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,still amorphous.
663,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
664,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
665,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
666,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
667,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,How to find the way back
668,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"by subway, streetcar, bus..."
669,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
670,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Can a hill disappear
671,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,or the stream in a park?
672,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
673,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"The morning's scent of rolls,"
674,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the sound of skates at dusk
675,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
676,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Laundry roofs, coalbin chutes,"
677,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"wagons, carts, iron stoops..."
678,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
679,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Like footprints in the snow,"
680,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the memories fall and drift.
681,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
682,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I walk, I look, I ask,"
683,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,a shadow in the past.
684,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
685,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
686,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
687,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
688,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I ran to say goodbye
689,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to the last railway train
690,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
691,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Whose old, musty freight cars"
692,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,were creaking at the joints.
693,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
694,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"In it, tons of paper,"
695,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,unpublished manuscripts
696,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
697,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Heading for the graveyard
698,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,like passengers turned ghosts.
699,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
700,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"At the rear, an organ,"
701,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,installed in the caboose
702,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
703,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Began the slow, slow march,"
704,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,while the wind mourned and blew.
705,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
706,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
707,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
708,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
709,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"O most blessed and damned of women,"
710,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,so greatly loved!
711,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
712,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I know by my dreams that your own
713,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,have never died.
714,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
715,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Before there was Egypt or Troy,"
716,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,you were a slave.
717,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
718,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Before Tristram or Abelard,"
719,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,your face was pale.
720,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
721,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,While poets made heaven and hell
722,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to prove your charms
723,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
724,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Your passion, beauty, grief and joy"
725,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,slept in my arms.
726,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
727,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
728,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
729,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
730,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"With all that space to explore,"
731,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,how could I resist?
732,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
733,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Finding my own place out there,"
734,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the wonder of it!
735,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
736,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"A stretched canvas came in view,"
737,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"linen, framed in gold"
738,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
739,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"With a palette never used,"
740,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,meant for me alone.
741,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
742,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I dipped my brush and painted
743,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the place I loved best
744,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
745,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Then forever set my claim:
746,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"north, south, east and west."
747,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
748,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
749,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
750,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
751,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I had to go on and on,"
752,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the search was not done.
753,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
754,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Winding corridors,"
755,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,walls leading from door to door.
756,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
757,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Mice, lions, sheep, chickens, frogs,"
758,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,unassorted odds.
759,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
760,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Nothing suited--quite--
761,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,despite the resemblances.
762,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
763,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I heard voices, laughter, groans,"
764,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,sounds foreign to mine.
765,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
766,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Mirrors, symbols, signs..."
767,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"twice, I almost found myself."
768,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
769,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
770,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
771,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
772,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"The room was full of eyes,"
773,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,whichever way I looked.
774,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
775,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Over walls, ceiling, floor,"
776,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,they darted back and forth
777,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
778,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Their eyelash hands and feet
779,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,mocking me and my book.
780,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
781,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"""You can not get away,"
782,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I've told you that before."""
783,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
784,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Daddy longlegs reaching,"
785,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"still haunting, still speaking."
786,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
787,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"""A spider ghost, you say?"
788,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"The harvest comes, daughter."""
789,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
790,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
791,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
792,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
793,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,They tossed the pillow
794,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,from one hand to the other.
795,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
796,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"With roars of laughter,"
797,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"it zipped, it flew, was caught and thrown."
798,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
799,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"My seams ripped open,"
800,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,scattering my heart outside.
801,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
802,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Slowly, painfully,"
803,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I gathered it together
804,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
805,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"And lay down to sleep,"
806,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"clutching my life, my pillow."
807,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
808,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Feathers of dead birds,"
809,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,sterile echoes of lost flights.
810,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
811,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
812,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
813,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
814,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"A bill collector appeared,"
815,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,flourishing old bills.
816,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
817,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"""Your father gone, and mother,"
818,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"who will pay for these?"""
819,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
820,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I turned to the telephone,"
821,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,one disconnected.
822,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
823,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I looked inside the mailbox,"
824,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,full of dead letters.
825,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
826,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I searched through files and desk drawers,"
827,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,all bankbooks cancelled.
828,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
829,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Only one thing left to do--
830,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"to wake, and escape."
831,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
832,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
833,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
834,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
835,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"It was a lettuce morning,"
836,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,crisp in pale sunlight.
837,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
838,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"By noon it was canary,"
839,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,cat's eye and corn grain.
840,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
841,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"As shadows crept through the hills,"
842,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the sea turned bilious.
843,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
844,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Dusk spilled a goodbye tunnel
845,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,down a shifting sky.
846,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
847,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Then driftwood, fuming the air"
848,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,with its smoke and cough.
849,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
850,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"After night crashed, we picked up"
851,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,plans for tomorrow.
852,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
853,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
854,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
855,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
856,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,When will the words be opened
857,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and the book unsealed?
858,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
859,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Not till the time of the end
860,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of empires and beasts.
861,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
862,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Then will the dream be written
863,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,according to men?
864,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
865,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Not till the signs and vision
866,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,have become as one.
867,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
868,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,How shall we learn to know them
869,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,as true evidence?
870,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
871,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Not till all human senses
872,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,merge with light again.
873,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
874,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
875,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
876,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
877,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"They were gone for days,"
878,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the hunters and fishermen
879,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
880,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Challenging the beasts
881,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,who claimed the land and the sea.
882,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
883,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,The young sang their praise
884,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,all through the gloried summer
885,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
886,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,While the women danced
887,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and gave them welcoming feasts.
888,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
889,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,How their deeds warmed us
890,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,winter nights! how bright the blaze!
891,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
892,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Now, we are fearful"
893,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and cold.  We need more old men.
894,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
895,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
896,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
897,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
898,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I turned back
899,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"the thick, heavy calendar of years"
900,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
901,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Laboring,"
902,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,page by century by page of scroll
903,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
904,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,To restore
905,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,the undiscovered new world once more
906,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
907,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Hoping to
908,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"reverse the winds and tides, west to east"
909,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
910,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,To exchange
911,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"the ships, the crews, the conquests and all."
912,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
913,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,But gained what
914,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,by throwing Columbus overboard?
915,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
916,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
917,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
918,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
919,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Shakespeare and Cervantes
920,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,died the same day and year.
921,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
922,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,So too Diogenes
923,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and Great Alexander
924,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
925,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Although each said farewell
926,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,in places far apart.
927,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
928,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,What extinguished both flames
929,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,at one instant of time?
930,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
931,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,A whirlwind in the night
932,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,or a merciful rain?
933,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
934,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,May a storm at my death
935,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,help me find my partner.
936,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
937,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
938,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
939,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
940,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,All of us who saw it from the ground
941,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,testified
942,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
943,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,It was the tortoise that fell and killed
944,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Aeschylus.
945,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
946,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"So Christ, Socrates, Galileo"
947,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"were killed, too."
948,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
949,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"We, the groundlings who witnessed their deaths,"
950,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,swear to you
951,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
952,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,It was the tortoise each time.  It fell
953,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,from the air.
954,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
955,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Some say eagles, by letting them fall."
956,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,But who knows?
957,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
958,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
959,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
960,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
961,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I watched his clay flesh
962,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,take its changing form from thought
963,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
964,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,And fling the fiction
965,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of his birth-by-chance to scorn.
966,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
967,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Science, he would say,"
968,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,is another way of life...
969,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
970,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Without a flutter
971,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,or doubt to betray his eyes.
972,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
973,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Such utter belief,"

976,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Suspending my own--
977,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,he holds his world with such ease.
978,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
979,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
980,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
981,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
982,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Then she who had been my wise teacher
983,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,in the past
984,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
985,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Came and stood at the foot of my bed,"
986,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"calling, ""Child..."

996,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
997,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Which vanished, as I wept in the dark,"

1001,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1002,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1003,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Not too much light left,"
1004,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I collect the candle's tears.
1005,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1006,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Prodigal before
1007,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of the sun and its seasons
1008,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1009,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Now I search the night

1011,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1012,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Asleep open-eyed,"
1013,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I turn my wax world slowly

1026,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1027,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Until the house stood vacant
1028,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,of all but its bones.

1045,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Because I longed
1046,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to comprehend the infinite

1048,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I drew a line
1049,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,between the known and unknown

1051,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,From zero base
1052,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to its apex point opposite

1110,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1111,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"The streets, laid out as kennels,"
1112,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,were strangely quiet.
1113,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1114,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Posted German Shepherd guards
1115,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,merely curled their lips
1116,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1117,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,And growled as I passed by them
1118,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,into the main office.
1119,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1120,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,The huge picture startled me.
1121,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Nothing else was there.
1122,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1123,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Only Big Brother, the Chief,"
1124,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,who looked down and stared.

1140,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1141,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Or, among the many species,"
1142,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,one with white blood.
1143,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1144,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I could question other colors:
1145,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"yellow, red, brown?"

1152,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1153,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,They are armed
1154,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,with the weapons of our memory.
1155,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1156,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"On all fronts,"
1157,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"they keep watch, to warn and remind us."
1158,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1159,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"At our call,"
1160,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,they rise from the graveyard of our minds
1161,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1162,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"And advance,"
1163,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"immune to hunger, guns, barbed wire, gas..."
1164,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1165,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Their mission:
1166,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to rescue time from its own worst foe.

1169,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1170,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1171,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"I know them, the assassins,"
1172,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,by the way they breathe
1173,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1174,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,As they slip behind the wheel
1175,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to strangle the road
1176,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1177,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,As they dive-bomb through the air
1178,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,to explode the night.
1179,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1180,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I hear the changing rhythms
1181,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"of their pulse, speech, steps"
1182,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1183,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"As they finger the trigger,"
1184,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,as they grasp the knife.
1185,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1186,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,I clock the surge of passions
1187,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,in their race with death.

1194,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1195,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,An alien world
1196,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,as perceived through curtained windows.
1197,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1198,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"Seen from afar,"
1199,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"the fires, riots, car wrecks, brawls"
1200,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1201,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Made me recoil
1202,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,and threatened the night while I slept.
1203,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1204,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,Nor found I joy
1205,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"in revels, circuses and feats"
1206,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,
1207,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"My skin thin, too,"
1208,THE HOUSE OF SLEEP,"for the rocks, the drums, the stampedes."

1328,THE SAILOR'S STORY,
1329,THE SAILOR'S STORY,I left silently

1360,THE SAILOR'S STORY,
1361,THE SAILOR'S STORY,"Though we had strong sails, good winds"
1362,THE SAILOR'S STORY,and plenty of hands.
1363,THE SAILOR'S STORY,
1364,THE SAILOR'S STORY,Yet I never can recall

1380,THE SAILOR'S STORY,
1381,THE SAILOR'S STORY,No one to trade with
1382,THE SAILOR'S STORY,and our vessel filled with jars.
1383,THE SAILOR'S STORY,
1384,THE SAILOR'S STORY,So we headed past the coast
1385,THE SAILOR'S STORY,toward open ocean
1386,THE SAILOR'S STORY,
1387,THE SAILOR'S STORY,"Where strange crews hailed us,"
1388,THE SAILOR'S STORY,"and for honey, gave us salt."

1398,THE SAILOR'S STORY,We had good care:

1400,THE SAILOR'S STORY,
1401,THE SAILOR'S STORY,"When my head cleared,"
1402,THE SAILOR'S STORY,there was a road along the cliffs
1403,THE SAILOR'S STORY,
1404,THE SAILOR'S STORY,Which I followed
1405,THE SAILOR'S STORY,past the village behind the goats
1406,THE SAILOR'S STORY,
1407,THE SAILOR'S STORY,Feeling the ground
1408,THE SAILOR'S STORY,steady and true for a good house.
