26,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,
27,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,
28,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,"_I step across the mystic border-land,_"
29,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_And look upon the wonder-world of Art._
30,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,"_How beautiful, how beautiful its hills!_"
31,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,"_And all its valleys, how surpassing fair!_"
32,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,
33,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_The winding paths that lead up to the heights_
34,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_Are polished by the footsteps of the great._
35,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_The mountain-peaks stand very near to God:_
36,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_The chosen few whose feet have trod thereon_
37,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,"_Have talked with Him, and with the angels walked._"
38,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,
39,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_Here are no sounds of discord--no profane_
40,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_Or senseless gossip of unworthy things--_
41,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_Only the songs of chisels and of pens._
42,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,"_Of busy brushes, and ecstatic strains_"
43,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_Of souls surcharged with music most divine._
44,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,"_Here is no idle sorrow, no poor grief_"
45,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_For any day or object left behind--_
46,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,"_For time is counted precious, and herein_"
47,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_Is such complete abandonment of Self_
48,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,"_That tears turn into rainbows, and enhance_"
49,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_The beauty of the land where all is fair._
50,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,
51,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,"_Awed and afraid, I cross the border-land._"
52,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,"_Oh, who am I, that I dare enter here_"
53,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_Where the great artists of the world have trod--_
54,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_The genius-crowned aristocrats of Earth?_
55,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_Only the singer of a little song;_
56,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_Yet loving Art with such a mighty love_
57,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_I hold it greater to have won a place_
58,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,"_Just on the fair land's edge, to make my grave,_"
59,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_Than in the outer world of greed and gain_
60,ELLA WHEELER WILCOX,_To sit upon a royal throne and reign._

171,_PART I._,_PART I._
172,_PART I._,
173,_PART I._,"I sat and sewed, and sang some tender tune,"
174,_PART I._,"Oh, beauteous was that morn in early June!"
175,_PART I._,"Mellow with sunlight, and with blossoms fair:"
176,_PART I._,"The climbing rose-tree grew about me there,"
177,_PART I._,And checked with shade the sunny portico
178,_PART I._,"Where, morns like this, I came to read, or sew."
179,_PART I._,
180,_PART I._,"I heard the gate click, and a firm quick tread"
181,_PART I._,Upon the walk. No need to turn my head;
182,_PART I._,"I would mistake, and doubt my own voice sounding,"
183,_PART I._,Before his step upon the gravel bounding.
184,_PART I._,"In an unstudied attitude of grace,"
185,_PART I._,He stretched his comely form; and from his face
186,_PART I._,"He tossed the dark, damp curls; and at my knees,"
187,_PART I._,"With his broad hat he fanned the lazy breeze,"
188,_PART I._,"And turned his head, and lifted his large eyes,"
189,_PART I._,"Of that strange hue we see in ocean dyes,"
190,_PART I._,"And call it blue sometimes, and sometimes green"
191,_PART I._,"And save in poet eyes, not elsewhere seen."
192,_PART I._,
193,_PART I._,"""Lest I should meet with my fair lady's scorning,"
194,_PART I._,"For calling quite so early in the morning,"
195,_PART I._,"I've brought a passport that can never fail,"""
196,_PART I._,"He said, and, laughing, laid the morning mail"
197,_PART I._,"Upon my lap. ""I'm welcome? so I thought!"
198,_PART I._,I'll figure by the letters that I brought
199,_PART I._,How glad you are to see me. Only one?
200,_PART I._,And that one from a lady? I'm undone!
201,_PART I._,"That, lightly skimmed, you'll think me _such_ a bore,"
202,_PART I._,And wonder why I did not bring you four.
203,_PART I._,It's ever thus: a woman cannot get
204,_PART I._,So many letters that she will not fret
205,_PART I._,"O'er one that did not come."""
206,_PART I._,"""I'll prove you wrong,"""
207,_PART I._,"I answered gayly, ""here upon the spot!"
208,_PART I._,"This little letter, precious if not long,"
209,_PART I._,"Is just the one, of all you might have brought,"
210,_PART I._,"To please me. You have heard me speak, I'm sure,"
211,_PART I._,Of Helen Trevor: she writes here to say
212,_PART I._,She's coming out to see me; and will stay
213,_PART I._,"Till Autumn, maybe. She is, like her note,"
214,_PART I._,"Petite and dainty, tender, loving, pure."
215,_PART I._,"You'd know her by a letter that she wrote,"
216,_PART I._,For a sweet tinted thing. 'Tis always so:--
217,_PART I._,"Letters all blots, though finely written, show"
218,_PART I._,A slovenly person. Letters stiff and white
219,_PART I._,"Bespeak a nature honest, plain, upright."
220,_PART I._,"And tissuey, tinted, perfumed notes, like this,"
221,_PART I._,"Tell of a creature formed to pet and kiss."""
222,_PART I._,
223,_PART I._,"My listener heard me with a slow, odd smile;"
224,_PART I._,"Stretched in abandon at my feet, the while,"
225,_PART I._,He fanned me idly with his broad-brimmed hat.
226,_PART I._,"""Then all young ladies must be formed for that!"""
227,_PART I._,"He laughed, and said."
228,_PART I._,"""Their letters read, and look,"
229,_PART I._,As like as twenty copies of one book.
230,_PART I._,"They're written in a dainty, spider scrawl,"
231,_PART I._,"To 'darling, precious Kate,' or 'Fan,' or 'Moll.'"
232,_PART I._,"The 'dearest, sweetest' friend they ever had."
233,_PART I._,"They say they 'want to see you, oh, so bad!'"
234,_PART I._,"Vow they'll 'forget you, never, _never_, oh!'"
235,_PART I._,And then they tell about a splendid beau--
236,_PART I._,"A lovely hat--a charming dress, and send"
237,_PART I._,A little scrap of this to every friend.
238,_PART I._,"And then to close, for lack of something better,"
239,_PART I._,"They beg you'll 'read and burn this horrid letter.'"""
240,_PART I._,
241,_PART I._,"He watched me, smiling. He was prone to vex"
242,_PART I._,And hector me with flings upon my sex.
243,_PART I._,"He liked, he said, to have me flash and frown,"
244,_PART I._,"So he could tease me, and then laugh me down."
245,_PART I._,My storms of wrath amused him very much:
246,_PART I._,He liked to see me go off at a touch;
247,_PART I._,"Anger became me--made my color rise,"
248,_PART I._,And gave an added luster to my eyes.
249,_PART I._,"So he would talk--and so he watched me now,"
250,_PART I._,To see the hot flush mantle cheek and brow.
251,_PART I._,
252,_PART I._,"Instead, I answered coolly, with a smile,"
253,_PART I._,"Felling a seam with utmost care, meanwhile."
254,_PART I._,"""The caustic tongue of Vivian Dangerfield"
255,_PART I._,"Is barbed as ever, for my sex, this morn."
256,_PART I._,"Still unconvinced, no smallest point I yield."
257,_PART I._,"Woman I love, and trust, despite your scorn."
258,_PART I._,"There is some truth in what you say? Well, yes!"
259,_PART I._,Your statements usually hold more or less.
260,_PART I._,Some women write weak letters--(some men do;)
261,_PART I._,"Some make professions, knowing them untrue."
262,_PART I._,"And woman's friendship, in the time of need,"
263,_PART I._,"I own, too often proves a broken reed."
264,_PART I._,"But I believe, and ever will contend,"
265,_PART I._,"Woman can be a sister woman's friend,"
266,_PART I._,Giving from out her large heart's bounteous store
267,_PART I._,A living love--claiming to do no more
268,_PART I._,"Than, through and by that love, she knows she can;"
269,_PART I._,"And living by her professions, _like a man_."
270,_PART I._,"And such a tie, true friendship's silken tether,"
271,_PART I._,Binds Helen Trevor's heart and mine together.
272,_PART I._,"I love her for her beauty, meekness, grace;"
273,_PART I._,For her white lily soul and angel face.
274,_PART I._,"She loves me, for my greater strength, may be;"
275,_PART I._,Loves--and would give her heart's best blood for me
276,_PART I._,"And I, to save her from a pain, or cross,"
277,_PART I._,Would suffer any sacrifice or loss.
278,_PART I._,Such can be woman's friendship for another.
279,_PART I._,"Could man give more, or ask more from a brother?"""
280,_PART I._,
281,_PART I._,I paused: and Vivian leaned his massive head
282,_PART I._,"Against the pillar of the portico,"
283,_PART I._,"Smiled his slow, skeptic smile, then laughed, and said:"
284,_PART I._,"""Nay, surely not--if what you say be so."
285,_PART I._,"You've made a statement, but no proof's at hand."
286,_PART I._,Wait--do not flash your eyes so! Understand
287,_PART I._,I think you quite sincere in what you say:
288,_PART I._,"You love your friend, and she loves you, to-day;"
289,_PART I._,But friendship is not friendship at the best
290,_PART I._,Till circumstances put it to the test.
291,_PART I._,"Man's, less demonstrative, stands strain and tear,"
292,_PART I._,"While woman's, half profession, fails to wear."
293,_PART I._,Two women love each other passing well--
294,_PART I._,"Say Helen Trevor and Maurine La Pelle,"
295,_PART I._,Just for example.
296,_PART I._,Let them daily meet
297,_PART I._,"At ball and concert, in the church and street,"
298,_PART I._,"They kiss and coo, they visit, chat, caress;"
299,_PART I._,"Their love increases, rather than grows less;"
300,_PART I._,"And all goes well, till 'Helen dear' discovers"
301,_PART I._,That 'Maurine darling' wins too many lovers.
302,_PART I._,
303,_PART I._,"And then her 'precious friend,' her 'pet,' her 'sweet,'"
304,_PART I._,"Becomes a 'minx,' a 'creature all deceit.'"
305,_PART I._,"Let Helen smile too oft on Maurine's beaux,"
306,_PART I._,"Or wear more stylish or becoming clothes,"
307,_PART I._,Or sport a hat that has a longer feather--
308,_PART I._,And lo! the strain has broken 'friendship's tether.'
309,_PART I._,Maurine's sweet smile becomes a frown or pout;
310,_PART I._,'She's just begun to find that Helen out'
311,_PART I._,The breach grows wider--anger fills each heart;
312,_PART I._,"They drift asunder, whom 'but death could part.'"
313,_PART I._,"You shake your head? Oh, well, we'll never know!"
314,_PART I._,It is not likely Fate will test you so.
315,_PART I._,"You'll live, and love; and, meeting twice a year,"
316,_PART I._,"While life shall last, you'll hold each other dear."
317,_PART I._,I pray it may be so; it were not best
318,_PART I._,To shake your faith in woman by the test.
319,_PART I._,"Keep your belief, and nurse it while you can."
320,_PART I._,I've faith in woman's friendship too--for man!
321,_PART I._,"They're true as steel, as mothers, friends, and wives:"
322,_PART I._,And that's enough to bless us all our lives.
323,_PART I._,"That man's a selfish fellow, and a bore,"
324,_PART I._,"Who is unsatisfied, and asks for more."""
325,_PART I._,
326,_PART I._,"""But there is need of more!"" I here broke in."
327,_PART I._,"""I hold that woman guilty of a sin,"
328,_PART I._,"Who would not cling to, and defend another,"
329,_PART I._,As nobly as she would stand by a brother.
330,_PART I._,"Who would not suffer for a sister's sake,"
331,_PART I._,"And, were there need to prove her friendship, make"
332,_PART I._,"'Most any sacrifice, nor count the cost."
333,_PART I._,Who would not do this for a friend is lost
334,_PART I._,"To every nobler principle."""
335,_PART I._,"""Shame, shame!"""
336,_PART I._,"Cried Vivian, laughing, ""for you now defame"
337,_PART I._,The whole sweet sex; since there's not one would do
338,_PART I._,"The thing you name, nor would I want her to."
339,_PART I._,I love the sex. My mother was a woman--
340,_PART I._,"I hope my wife will be, and wholly human."
341,_PART I._,"And if she wants to make some sacrifice,"
342,_PART I._,I'll think her far more sensible and wise
343,_PART I._,"To let her husband reap the benefit,"
344,_PART I._,Instead of some old maid or senseless chit.
345,_PART I._,Selfish? Of course! I hold all love is so:
346,_PART I._,"And I shall love my wife right well, I know."
347,_PART I._,"Now there's a point regarding selfish love,"
348,_PART I._,"You thirst to argue with me, and disprove."
349,_PART I._,But since these cosy hours will soon be gone
350,_PART I._,"And all our meetings broken in upon,"
351,_PART I._,No more of these rare moments must be spent
352,_PART I._,"In vain discussions, or in argument."
353,_PART I._,I wish Miss Trevor was in--Jericho!
354,_PART I._,(You see the selfishness begins to show.)
355,_PART I._,She wants to see you?--So do I: but she
356,_PART I._,"Will gain her wish, by taking you from me."
357,_PART I._,'Come all the same?' that means I'll be allowed
358,_PART I._,To realize that 'three can make a crowd.'
359,_PART I._,I do not like to feel myself _de trop_.
360,_PART I._,With two girl cronies would I not be so?
361,_PART I._,My ring would interrupt some private chat.
362,_PART I._,"You'd ask me in and take my cane and hat,"
363,_PART I._,"And speak about the lovely summer day,"
364,_PART I._,And think--'The lout! I wish he'd kept away.'
365,_PART I._,"Miss Trevor'd smile, but just to hide a pout"
366,_PART I._,And count the moments till I was shown out.
367,_PART I._,"And, while I twirled my thumbs, I would sit wishing"
368,_PART I._,"That I had gone off hunting birds, or fishing."
369,_PART I._,"No, thanks, Maurine! The iron hand of Fate,"
370,_PART I._,"(Or otherwise Miss Trevor's dainty fingers,)"
371,_PART I._,Will bar my entrance into Eden's gate;
372,_PART I._,And I shall be like some poor soul that lingers
373,_PART I._,"At heaven's portal, paying the price of sin,"
374,_PART I._,"Yet hoping to be pardoned and let in."""
375,_PART I._,
376,_PART I._,"He looked so melancholy sitting there,"
377,_PART I._,"I laughed outright. ""How well you act a part;"
378,_PART I._,You look the very picture of despair!
379,_PART I._,"You've missed your calling, sir! suppose you start"
380,_PART I._,"Upon a starring tour, and carve your name"
381,_PART I._,With Booth's and Barrett's on the heights of Fame.
382,_PART I._,"But now, tabooing nonsense, I shall send"
383,_PART I._,"For you to help me entertain my friend,"
384,_PART I._,"Unless you come without it. 'Cronies?' True,"
385,_PART I._,Wanting our 'private chats' as cronies do
386,_PART I._,"And we'll take those, while you are reading Greek,"
387,_PART I._,Or writing 'Lines to Dora's brow' or 'cheek.'
388,_PART I._,"But when you have an hour or two of leisure,"
389,_PART I._,"Call as you now do, and afford like pleasure."
390,_PART I._,"For never yet did heaven's sun shine on,"
391,_PART I._,"Or stars discover, that phenomenon,"
392,_PART I._,"In any country, or in any clime:"
393,_PART I._,"Two maids so bound, by ties of mind and heart."
394,_PART I._,They did not feel the heavy weight of time
395,_PART I._,In weeks of scenes wherein no man took part.
396,_PART I._,God made the sexes to associate:
397,_PART I._,"Nor law of man, nor stern decree of Fate,"
398,_PART I._,"Can ever undo what His hand has done,"
399,_PART I._,"And, quite alone, make happy either one."
400,_PART I._,My Helen is an only child:--a pet
401,_PART I._,Of loving parents: and she never yet
402,_PART I._,Has been denied one boon for which she pleaded.
403,_PART I._,"A fragile thing, her lightest wish was heeded."
404,_PART I._,"Would she pluck roses? they must first be shorn,"
405,_PART I._,"By careful hands, of every hateful thorn."
406,_PART I._,And loving eyes must scan the pathway where
407,_PART I._,"Her feet may tread, to see no stones are there."
408,_PART I._,"She'll grow dull here, in this secluded nook,"
409,_PART I._,Unless you aid me in the pleasant task
410,_PART I._,Of entertaining. Drop in with your book--
411,_PART I._,"Read, talk, sing for her sometimes. What I ask,"
412,_PART I._,"Do once, to please me: then there'll be no need"
413,_PART I._,"For me to state the case again, or plead."
414,_PART I._,There's nothing like a woman's grace and beauty
415,_PART I._,"To waken mankind to a sense of duty."""
416,_PART I._,
417,_PART I._,"""I bow before the mandate of my queen:"
418,_PART I._,"Your slightest wish is law, Ma Belle Maurine,"""
419,_PART I._,"He answered smiling, ""I'm at your command;"
420,_PART I._,"Point but one lily finger, or your wand,"
421,_PART I._,And you will find a willing slave obeying.
422,_PART I._,There goes my dinner bell! I hear it saying
423,_PART I._,"I've spent two hours here, lying at your feet,"
424,_PART I._,"Not profitable, maybe--surely sweet."
425,_PART I._,All time is money; now were I to measure
426,_PART I._,"The time I spend here by its solid pleasure,"
427,_PART I._,"And that were coined in dollars, then I've laid"
428,_PART I._,"Each day a fortune at your feet, fair maid."
429,_PART I._,"There goes that bell again! I'll say good-bye,"
430,_PART I._,Or clouds will shadow my domestic sky.
431,_PART I._,"I'll come again, as you would have me do,"
432,_PART I._,"And see your friend, while she is seeing you."
433,_PART I._,That's like by proxy being at a feast;
434,_PART I._,"Unsatisfactory, to say the least."""
435,_PART I._,
436,_PART I._,"He drew his fine shape up, and trod the land"
437,_PART I._,"With kingly grace. Passing the gate, his hand"
438,_PART I._,"He lightly placed the garden wall upon,"
439,_PART I._,"Leaped over like a leopard, and was gone."
440,_PART I._,
441,_PART I._,"And, going, took the brightness from the place,"
442,_PART I._,"Yet left the June day with a sweeter grace,"
443,_PART I._,"And my young soul so steeped in happy dreams,"
444,_PART I._,Heaven itself seemed shown to me in gleams.
445,_PART I._,"There is a time with lovers, when the heart"
446,_PART I._,"First slowly rouses from its dreamless sleep,"
447,_PART I._,"To all the tumult of a passion life,"
448,_PART I._,Ere yet have wakened jealousy and strife.
449,_PART I._,"Just as a young, untutored child will start"
450,_PART I._,"Out of a long hour's slumber, sound and deep,"
451,_PART I._,"And lie and smile with rosy lips, and cheeks,"
452,_PART I._,"In a sweet, restful trance, before it speaks."
453,_PART I._,"A time when yet no word the spell has broken,"
454,_PART I._,"Save what the heart unto the soul has spoken,"
455,_PART I._,"In quickened throbs, and sighs but half suppressed."
456,_PART I._,"A time when that sweet truth, all unconfessed,"
457,_PART I._,"Gives added fragrance to the summer flowers,"
458,_PART I._,"A golden glory to the passing hours,"
459,_PART I._,"A hopeful beauty to the plainest face,"
460,_PART I._,And lends to life a new and tender grace.
461,_PART I._,
462,_PART I._,"When the full heart has climbed the heights of bliss,"
463,_PART I._,"And, smiling, looks back o'er the golden past,"
464,_PART I._,I think it finds no sweeter hour than this
465,_PART I._,"In all love-life. For, later, when the last"
466,_PART I._,"Translucent drop o'erflows the cup of joy,"
467,_PART I._,"And love, more mighty than the heart's control,"
468,_PART I._,"Surges in words of passion from the soul,"
469,_PART I._,"And vows are asked and given, shadows rise"
470,_PART I._,"Like mists before the sun in noonday skies,"
471,_PART I._,"Vague fears, that prove the brimming cup's alloy;"
472,_PART I._,"A dread of change--the crowning moment's curse,"
473,_PART I._,"Since what is perfect, change but renders worse:"
474,_PART I._,"A vain desire to cripple Time, who goes"
475,_PART I._,"Bearing our joys away, and bringing woes."
476,_PART I._,"And later, doubts and jealousies awaken."
477,_PART I._,"And plighted hearts are tempest-tossed, and shaken."
478,_PART I._,"Doubt sends a test, that goes a step too far,"
479,_PART I._,"A wound is made, that, healing, leaves a scar,"
480,_PART I._,"Or one heart, full with love's sweet satisfaction,"
481,_PART I._,"Thinks truth once spoken always understood,"
482,_PART I._,While one is pining for the tender action
483,_PART I._,"And whispered word by which, of old, 'twas wooed."
484,_PART I._,
485,_PART I._,"But this blest hour, in love's glad, golden day,"
486,_PART I._,"Is like the dawning, ere the radiant ray"
487,_PART I._,"Of glowing Sol has burst upon the eye,"
488,_PART I._,"But yet is heralded in earth and sky,"
489,_PART I._,"Warm with its fervor, mellow with its light,"
490,_PART I._,While Care still slumbers in the arms of night.
491,_PART I._,"But Hope, awake, hears happy birdlings sing,"
492,_PART I._,And thinks of all a summer day may bring.
493,_PART I._,
494,_PART I._,"In this sweet calm, my young heart lay at rest,"
495,_PART I._,Filled with a blissful sense of peace; nor guessed
496,_PART I._,That sullen clouds were gathering in the skies
497,_PART I._,"To hide the glorious sun, ere it should rise."
498,_PART I._,
499,_PART I._,
500,_PART II._,_PART II._
501,_PART II._,
502,_PART II._,To little birds that never tire of humming
503,_PART II._,"About the garden, in the summer weather,"
504,_PART II._,"Aunt Ruth compared us, after Helen's coming,"
505,_PART II._,"As we two roamed, or sat and talked together."
506,_PART II._,"Twelve months apart, we had so much to say"
507,_PART II._,Of school days gone--and time since passed away;
508,_PART II._,"Of that old friend, and this; of what we'd done;"
509,_PART II._,Of how our separate paths in life had run;
510,_PART II._,"Of what we would do, in the coming years;"
511,_PART II._,"Of plans and castles, hopes and dreams and fears."
512,_PART II._,"All these, and more, as soon as we found speech,"
513,_PART II._,"We touched upon, and skimmed from this to that"
514,_PART II._,"But at the first, each only gazed on each,"
515,_PART II._,"And, dumb with joy, that did not need a voice"
516,_PART II._,"Like lesser joys, to say, ""Lo! I rejoice,"""
517,_PART II._,With smiling eyes and clasping hands we sat
518,_PART II._,"Wrapped in that peace, felt but with those dear,"
519,_PART II._,Contented just to know each other near.
520,_PART II._,But when this silent eloquence gave place
521,_PART II._,"To words, 'twas like the rising of a flood"
522,_PART II._,"Above a dam. We sat there, face to face,"
523,_PART II._,"And let our talk glide on where'er it would,"
524,_PART II._,"Speech never halting in its speed or zest,"
525,_PART II._,Save when our rippling laughter let it rest;
526,_PART II._,Just as a stream will sometimes pause and play
527,_PART II._,"About a bubbling spring, then dash away."
528,_PART II._,"No wonder, then, the third day's sun was nigh"
529,_PART II._,Up to the zenith when my friend and I
530,_PART II._,Opened our eyes from slumber long and deep:
531,_PART II._,Nature demanding recompense for hours
532,_PART II._,"Spent in the portico, among the flowers,"
533,_PART II._,Halves of two nights we should have spent in sleep.
534,_PART II._,
535,_PART II._,"So this third day, we breakfasted at one:"
536,_PART II._,"Then walked about the garden in the sun,"
537,_PART II._,"Hearing the thrushes and the robins sing,"
538,_PART II._,And looking to see what buds were opening.
539,_PART II._,
540,_PART II._,"The clock chimed three, and we yet strayed at will"
541,_PART II._,"About the yard in morning dishabille,"
542,_PART II._,"When Aunt Ruth came, with apron o'er her head,"
543,_PART II._,"Holding a letter in her hand, and said,"
544,_PART II._,"""Here is a note, from Vivian I opine;"
545,_PART II._,"At least his servant brought it. And now, girls,"
546,_PART II._,"You may think this is no concern of mine,"
547,_PART II._,"But in my day young ladies did not go,"
548,_PART II._,Till almost bed-time roaming to and fro
549,_PART II._,"In morning wrappers, and with tangled curls,"
550,_PART II._,The very pictures of forlorn distress.
551,_PART II._,"'Tis three o'clock, and time for you to dress."
552,_PART II._,"Come! read your note and hurry in, Maurine,"
553,_PART II._,"And make yourself fit object to be seen."""
554,_PART II._,
555,_PART II._,"Helen was bending o'er an almond bush,"
556,_PART II._,"And ere she looked up I had read the note,"
557,_PART II._,"And calmed my heart, that, bounding, sent a flush"
558,_PART II._,"To brow and cheek, at sight of aught _he_ wrote."
559,_PART II._,"""Ma Belle Maurine:"" (so Vivian's billet ran,)"
560,_PART II._,"""Is it not time I saw your cherished guest?"
561,_PART II._,"'Pity the sorrows of a poor young man,'"
562,_PART II._,Banished from all that makes existence blest.
563,_PART II._,I'm dying to see--your friend; and I will come
564,_PART II._,"And pay respects, hoping you'll be at home"
565,_PART II._,"To-night at eight. Expectantly, V. D."""
566,_PART II._,
567,_PART II._,"Inside my belt I slipped the billet, saying,"
568,_PART II._,"""Helen, go make yourself most fair to see:"
569,_PART II._,Quick! hurry now! no time for more delaying!
570,_PART II._,"In just five hours a caller will be here,"
571,_PART II._,"And you must look your prettiest, my dear!"
572,_PART II._,Begin your toilet right away. I know
573,_PART II._,How long it takes you to arrange each bow--
574,_PART II._,"To twist each curl, and loop your skirts aright."
575,_PART II._,"And you must prove you are _au fait_ to-night,"
576,_PART II._,And make a perfect toilet: for our caller
577,_PART II._,"Is man, and critic, poet, artist, scholar,"
578,_PART II._,"And views with eyes of all."""
579,_PART II._,"""Oh, oh! Maurine,"""
580,_PART II._,"Cried Helen with a well-feigned look of fear,"
581,_PART II._,"""You've frightened me so I shall not appear:"
582,_PART II._,"I'll hide away, refusing to be seen"
583,_PART II._,By such an ogre. Woe is me! bereft
584,_PART II._,"Of all my friends, my peaceful home I've left,"
585,_PART II._,And strayed away into the dreadful wood
586,_PART II._,To meet the fate of poor Red Riding Hood.
587,_PART II._,"No, Maurine, no! you've given me such a fright,"
588,_PART II._,"I'll not go near your ugly wolf to-night."""
589,_PART II._,
590,_PART II._,Meantime we'd left the garden; and I stood
591,_PART II._,"In Helen's room, where she had thrown herself"
592,_PART II._,"Upon a couch, and lay, a winsome elf,"
593,_PART II._,"Pouting and smiling, cheek upon her arm,"
594,_PART II._,Not in the least a portrait of alarm.
595,_PART II._,"""Now sweet!"" I coaxed, and knelt by her, ""be good!"
596,_PART II._,"Go curl your hair; and please your own Maurine,"
597,_PART II._,By putting on that lovely grenadine.
598,_PART II._,"Not wolf, nor ogre, neither Caliban,"
599,_PART II._,"Nor Mephistopheles, you'll meet to-night,"
600,_PART II._,But what the ladies call 'a nice young man'!
601,_PART II._,Yet one worth knowing--strong with health and might
602,_PART II._,"Of perfect manhood; gifted, noble, wise;"
603,_PART II._,"Moving among his kind with loving eyes,"
604,_PART II._,"And helpful hand; progressive, brave, refined,"
605,_PART II._,"After the image of his Maker's mind."""
606,_PART II._,
607,_PART II._,"""Now, now, Maurine!"" cried Helen, ""I believe"
608,_PART II._,It is your lover coming here this eve.
609,_PART II._,"Why have you never written of him, pray?"
610,_PART II._,"Is the day set?--and when? Say, Maurine, say!"""
611,_PART II._,
612,_PART II._,Had I betrayed by some too fervent word
613,_PART II._,The secret love that all my being stirred?
614,_PART II._,My lover? Ay! My heart proclaimed him so;
615,_PART II._,"But first _his_ lips must win the sweet confession,"
616,_PART II._,Ere even Helen be allowed to know.
617,_PART II._,I must straightway erase the slight impression
618,_PART II._,Made by the words just uttered.
619,_PART II._,"""Foolish child!"""
620,_PART II._,"I gayly cried, ""your fancy's straying wild."
621,_PART II._,Just let a girl of eighteen hear the name
622,_PART II._,"Of maid and youth uttered about one time,"
623,_PART II._,"And off her fancy goes, at break-neck pace,"
624,_PART II._,"Defying circumstances, reason, space--"
625,_PART II._,And straightway builds romances so sublime
626,_PART II._,They put all Shakespeare's dramas to the shame.
627,_PART II._,"This Vivian Dangerfield is neighbor, friend"
628,_PART II._,And kind companion; bringing books and flowers.
629,_PART II._,"And, by his thoughtful actions without end,"
630,_PART II._,Helping me pass some otherwise long hours;
631,_PART II._,But he has never breathed a word of love.
632,_PART II._,"If you still doubt me, listen while I prove"
633,_PART II._,My statement by the letter that he wrote.
634,_PART II._,'Dying to meet--my friend!' (she could not see
635,_PART II._,The dash between that meant so much to me.)
636,_PART II._,"'Will come this eve, at eight, and hopes we may"
637,_PART II._,Be in to greet him.' Now I think you'll say
638,_PART II._,"'Tis not much like a lover's tender note."""
639,_PART II._,
640,_PART II._,"We laugh, we jest, not meaning what we say;"
641,_PART II._,"We hide our thoughts, by light words lightly spoken,"
642,_PART II._,"And pass on heedless, till we find one day"
643,_PART II._,"They've bruised our hearts, or left some other broken."
644,_PART II._,
645,_PART II._,"I sought my room, and trilling some blithe air,"
646,_PART II._,"Opened my wardrobe, wondering what to wear."
647,_PART II._,Momentous question! femininely human!
648,_PART II._,"More than all others, vexing mind of woman,"
649,_PART II._,"Since that sad day, when in her discontent,"
650,_PART II._,"To search for leaves, our fair first mother went."
651,_PART II._,"All undecided what I should put on,"
652,_PART II._,At length I made selection of a lawn--
653,_PART II._,"White, with a tiny pink vine overrun:--"
654,_PART II._,"My simplest robe, but Vivian's favorite one."
655,_PART II._,"And placing a single flowret in my hair,"
656,_PART II._,"I crossed the hall to Helen's chamber, where"
657,_PART II._,"I found her with her fair locks all let down,"
658,_PART II._,"Brushing the kinks out, with a pretty frown."
659,_PART II._,"'T was like a picture, or a pleasing play,"
660,_PART II._,"To watch her make her toilet. She would stand,"
661,_PART II._,"And turn her head first this and then that way,"
662,_PART II._,"Trying effect of ribbon, bow or band."
663,_PART II._,"Then she would pick up something else, and curve"
664,_PART II._,"Her lovely neck, with cunning, bird-like grace,"
665,_PART II._,"And watch the mirror while she put it on,"
666,_PART II._,With such a sweetly grave and thoughtful face;
667,_PART II._,"And then to view it all would sway, and swerve"
668,_PART II._,"Her lithe young body, like a graceful swan."
669,_PART II._,
670,_PART II._,"Helen was over medium height, and slender"
671,_PART II._,"Even to frailty. Her great, wistful eyes"
672,_PART II._,Were like the deep blue of autumnal skies;
673,_PART II._,"And through them looked her soul, large, loving, tender."
674,_PART II._,"Her long, light hair was lusterless, except"
675,_PART II._,"Upon the ends, where burnished sunbeams slept,"
676,_PART II._,And on the earlocks; and she looped the curls
677,_PART II._,"Back with a shell comb, studded thick with pearls,"
678,_PART II._,"Costly yet simple. Her pale loveliness,"
679,_PART II._,"That night, was heightened by her rich, black dress,"
680,_PART II._,"That trailed behind her, leaving half in sight"
681,_PART II._,"Her taper arms, and shoulders marble white."
682,_PART II._,
683,_PART II._,"I was not tall as Helen, and my face"
684,_PART II._,Was shaped and colored like my grandsire's race;
685,_PART II._,"For through his veins my own received the warm,"
686,_PART II._,"Red blood of southern France, which curved my form,"
687,_PART II._,"And glowed upon my cheek in crimson dyes,"
688,_PART II._,"And bronzed my hair, and darkled in my eyes."
689,_PART II._,"And as the morning trails the skirts of night,"
690,_PART II._,"And dusky night puts on the garb of morn,"
691,_PART II._,"And walk together when the day is born,"
692,_PART II._,"So we two glided down the hall and stair,"
693,_PART II._,"Arm clasping arm, into the parlor, where"
694,_PART II._,"Sat Vivian, bathed in sunset's gorgeous light."
695,_PART II._,He rose to greet us. Oh! his form was grand;
696,_PART II._,"And he possessed that power, strange, occult,"
697,_PART II._,"Called magnetism, lacking better word,"
698,_PART II._,"Which moves the world, achieving great result"
699,_PART II._,"Where genius fails completely. Touch his hand,"
700,_PART II._,"It thrilled through all your being--meet his eye,"
701,_PART II._,"And you were moved, yet knew not how, or why."
702,_PART II._,"Let him but rise, you felt the air was stirred"
703,_PART II._,By an electric current.
704,_PART II._,
705,_PART II._,This strange force
706,_PART II._,"Is mightier than genius. Rightly used,"
707,_PART II._,It leads to grand achievements; all things yield
708,_PART II._,"Before its mystic presence, and its field"
709,_PART II._,"Is broad as earth and heaven. But abused,"
710,_PART II._,It sweeps like a poison simoon on its course
711,_PART II._,"Bearing miasma in its scorching breath,"
712,_PART II._,And leaving all it touches struck with death.
713,_PART II._,
714,_PART II._,Far-reaching science shall yet tear away
715,_PART II._,"The mystic garb that hides it from the day,"
716,_PART II._,"And drag it forth and bind it with its laws,"
717,_PART II._,"And make it serve the purposes of men,"
718,_PART II._,Guided by common sense and reason. Then
719,_PART II._,"We'll hear no more of seance, table-rapping,"
720,_PART II._,"And all that trash, o'er which the world is gaping,"
721,_PART II._,"Lost in effect, while science seeks the cause."
722,_PART II._,
723,_PART II._,Vivian was not conscious of his power:
724,_PART II._,"Or, if he was, knew not its full extent."
725,_PART II._,"He knew his glance would make a wild beast cower,"
726,_PART II._,And yet he knew not that his large eyes sent
727,_PART II._,Into the heart of woman the same thrill
728,_PART II._,That made the lion servant of his will.
729,_PART II._,And even strong men felt it.
730,_PART II._,
731,_PART II._,"He arose,"
732,_PART II._,"Reached forth his hand, and in it clasped my own,"
733,_PART II._,While I held Helen's; and he spoke some word
734,_PART II._,"Of pleasant greeting in his low, round tone,"
735,_PART II._,Unlike all other voices I have heard.
736,_PART II._,"Just as the white cloud, at the sunrise, glows"
737,_PART II._,"With roseate colors, so the pallid hue"
738,_PART II._,"Of Helen's cheek, like tinted sea-shells grew."
739,_PART II._,"Through mine, his hand caused hers to tremble; such"
740,_PART II._,Was the all-mast'ring magic of his touch.
741,_PART II._,
742,_PART II._,"Then we sat down, and talked about the weather,"
743,_PART II._,The neighborhood--some author's last new book.
744,_PART II._,"But, when I could, I left the two together"
745,_PART II._,"To make acquaintance, saying I must look"
746,_PART II._,After the chickens--my especial care;
747,_PART II._,"And ran away, and left them, laughing, there."
748,_PART II._,
749,_PART II._,"Knee-deep, through clover, to the poplar grove,"
750,_PART II._,"I waded, where my pets were wont to rove:"
751,_PART II._,And there I found the foolish mother hen
752,_PART II._,"Brooding her chickens underneath a tree,"
753,_PART II._,"An easy prey for foxes. ""Chick-a-dee,"""
754,_PART II._,"Quoth I, while reaching for the downy things"
755,_PART II._,"That, chirping, peeped from out the mother-wings,"
756,_PART II._,"""How very human is your folly! When"
757,_PART II._,"There waits a haven, pleasant, bright, and warm,"
758,_PART II._,And one to lead you thither from the storm
759,_PART II._,"And lurking dangers, yet you turn away."
760,_PART II._,"And, thinking to be your own protector, stray"
761,_PART II._,"Into the open jaws of death: for, see!"
762,_PART II._,An owl is sitting in this very tree
763,_PART II._,"You thought safe shelter. Go now to your pen."""
764,_PART II._,"And, followed by the clucking, clamorous hen,"
765,_PART II._,"So like the human mother here again,"
766,_PART II._,"Moaning because a strong, protecting arm"
767,_PART II._,"Would shield her little ones from cold and harm,"
768,_PART II._,I carried back my garden hat brimful
769,_PART II._,"Of chirping chickens, like white balls of wool,"
770,_PART II._,And snugly housed them.
771,_PART II._,And just then I heard
772,_PART II._,"A sound like gentle winds among the trees,"
773,_PART II._,"Or pleasant waters in the Summer, stirred"
774,_PART II._,And set in motion by a passing breeze.
775,_PART II._,"'T was Helen singing: and, as I drew near,"
776,_PART II._,"Another voice, a tenor full and clear,"
777,_PART II._,"Mingled with hers, as murmuring streams unite,"
778,_PART II._,And flow on stronger in their wedded might.
779,_PART II._,"It was a way of Helen's, not to sing"
780,_PART II._,The songs that other people sang. She took
781,_PART II._,Sometimes an extract from an ancient book;
782,_PART II._,"Again some floating, fragmentary thing"
783,_PART II._,"And such she fitted to old melodies,"
784,_PART II._,Or else composed the music. One of these
785,_PART II._,"She sang that night; and Vivian caught the strain,"
786,_PART II._,"And joined her in the chorus, or refrain,"
787,_PART II._,
788,SONG.,SONG.
789,SONG.,
790,SONG.,"O thou, mine other, stronger part!"
791,SONG.,"Whom yet I cannot hear, or see,"
792,SONG.,"Come thou, and take this loving heart,"
793,SONG.,"That longs to yield its all to thee,"
794,SONG.,"I call mine own--Oh, come to me!"
795,SONG.,"Love, answer back, I come to thee,"
796,SONG.,I come to thee.
797,SONG.,
798,SONG.,"This hungry heart, so warm, so large,"
799,SONG.,Is far too great a care for me.
800,SONG.,I have grown weary of the charge
801,SONG.,I keep so sacredly for thee.
802,SONG.,"Come thou, and take my heart from me."
803,SONG.,"Love, answer back, I come to thee,"
804,SONG.,I come to thee.
805,SONG.,
806,SONG.,"I am aweary, waiting here"
807,SONG.,For one who tarries long from me.
808,SONG.,"O! art thou far, or art thou near?"
809,SONG.,And must I still be sad for thee?
810,SONG.,Or wilt thou straightway come to me?
811,SONG.,"Love, answer, I am near to thee,"
812,SONG.,I come to thee.
813,SONG.,
814,SONG.,"The melody, so full of plaintive chords,"
815,SONG.,Sobbed into silence--echoing down the strings
816,SONG.,"Like voice of one who walks from us, and sings."
817,SONG.,Vivian had leaned upon the instrument
818,SONG.,"The while they sang. But, as he spoke those words,"
819,SONG.,"""Love, I am near to thee, I come to thee,"""
820,SONG.,"He turned his grand head slowly round, and bent"
821,SONG.,"His lustrous, soulful, speaking gaze on me."
822,SONG.,"And my young heart, eager to own its king,"
823,SONG.,"Sent to my eyes a great, glad, trustful light"
824,SONG.,"Of love and faith, and hung upon my cheek"
825,SONG.,Hope's rose-hued flag. There was no need to speak.
826,SONG.,"I crossed the room, and knelt by Helen. ""Sing"
827,SONG.,"That song you sang a fragment of one night,"
828,SONG.,"Out on the porch, beginning, 'Praise me not,'"""
829,SONG.,I whispered: and her sweet and plaintive tone
830,SONG.,"Rose, low and tender, as if she had caught"
831,SONG.,"From some sad passing breeze, and made her own,"
832,SONG.,"The echo of the wind-harp's sighing strain,"
833,SONG.,Or the soft music of the falling rain.
834,SONG.,
835,SONG.,SONG.
836,SONG.,
837,SONG.,"O praise me not with your lips, dear one!"
838,SONG.,Though your tender words I prize.
839,SONG.,But dearer by far is the soulful gaze
840,SONG.,"Of your eyes, your beautiful eyes,"
841,SONG.,"Your tender, loving eyes."
842,SONG.,
843,SONG.,"O chide me not with your lips, dear one!"
844,SONG.,Though I cause your bosom sighs.
845,SONG.,You can make repentance deeper far
846,SONG.,"By your sad, reproving eyes,"
847,SONG.,"Your sorrowful, troubled eyes."
848,SONG.,
849,SONG.,"Words, at the best, are but hollow sounds;"
850,SONG.,"Above, in the beaming skies,"
851,SONG.,"The constant stars say never a word,"
852,SONG.,But only smile with their eyes--
853,SONG.,Smile on with their lustrous eyes.
854,SONG.,
855,SONG.,"Then breathe no vow with your lips, dear one;"
856,SONG.,On the wingèd wind speech flies.
857,SONG.,But I read the truth of your noble heart
858,SONG.,"In your soulful, speaking eyes--"
859,SONG.,In your deep and beautiful eyes.
860,SONG.,
861,SONG.,"The twilight darkened 'round us, in the room,"
862,SONG.,"While Helen sang; and, in the gathering gloom,"
863,SONG.,"Vivian reached out, and took my hand in his,"
864,SONG.,And held it so; while Helen made the air
865,SONG.,"Languid with music. Then a step drew near,"
866,SONG.,And voice of Aunt Ruth broke the spell:
867,SONG.,"""Dear! dear!"
868,SONG.,"Why Maurie, Helen, children! how is this?"
869,SONG.,"I hear you, but you have no light in there."
870,SONG.,Your room is dark as Egypt. What a way
871,SONG.,"For folks to visit!--Maurie, go, I pray,"
872,SONG.,"And order lamps."""
873,SONG.,"And so there came a light,"
874,SONG.,And all the sweet dreams hovering around
875,SONG.,The twilight shadows flitted in affright:
876,SONG.,And e'en the music had a harsher sound.
877,SONG.,
878,SONG.,In pleasant converse passed an hour away:
879,SONG.,And Vivian planned a picnic for next day--
880,SONG.,"A drive the next, and rambles without end,"
881,SONG.,That he might help me entertain my friend.
882,SONG.,"And then he rose, bowed low, and passed from sight,"
883,SONG.,Like some great star that drops out from the night;
884,SONG.,"And Helen watched him through the shadows go,"
885,SONG.,"And turned and said, her voice subdued and low,"
886,SONG.,"""How tall he is! in all my life, Maurine,"
887,SONG.,"A grander man I never yet have seen."""

890,_PART III._,_PART III._
891,_PART III._,
892,_PART III._,One golden twelfth-part of a checkered year;
893,_PART III._,"One summer month, of sunlight, moonlight, mirth"
894,_PART III._,"With not a hint of shadows lurking near,"
895,_PART III._,Or storm-clouds brewing.
896,_PART III._,
897,_PART III._,'T was a royal day:
898,_PART III._,"Voluptuous July held her lover, Earth,"
899,_PART III._,"With her warm arms, upon her glowing breast,"
900,_PART III._,"And twined herself about him, as he lay"
901,_PART III._,Smiling and panting in his dream-stirred rest.
902,_PART III._,"She bound him with her limbs of perfect grace,"
903,_PART III._,"And hid him with her trailing robe of green,"
904,_PART III._,"And wound him in her long hair's shimmering sheen,"
905,_PART III._,And rained her ardent kisses on his face.
906,_PART III._,
907,_PART III._,Through the glad glory of the summer land
908,_PART III._,"Helen and I went wandering, hand in hand."
909,_PART III._,"In winding paths, hard by the ripe wheat-field,"
910,_PART III._,"White with the promise of a bounteous yield,"
911,_PART III._,"Across the late shorn meadow--down the hill,"
912,_PART III._,"Red with the tiger-lily blossoms, till"
913,_PART III._,"We stood upon the borders of the lake,"
914,_PART III._,"That like a pretty, placid infant, slept"
915,_PART III._,Low at its base: and little ripples crept
916,_PART III._,"Along its surface, just as dimples chase"
917,_PART III._,Each other o'er an infant's sleeping face
918,_PART III._,
919,_PART III._,Helen in idle hours had learned to make
920,_PART III._,"A thousand pretty, feminine knick-knacks:"
921,_PART III._,"For brackets, ottomans, and toilet stands--"
922,_PART III._,Labor just suited to her dainty hands.
923,_PART III._,"That morning she had been at work in wax,"
924,_PART III._,"Molding a wreath of flowers for my room,--"
925,_PART III._,"Taking her patterns from the living blows,"
926,_PART III._,"In all their dewy beauty and sweet bloom,"
927,_PART III._,"Fresh from my garden. Fuchsia, tulip, rose,"
928,_PART III._,"And trailing ivy, grew beneath her touch,"
929,_PART III._,Resembling the living plants as much
930,_PART III._,As life is copied in the form of death:
931,_PART III._,"These lacking but the perfume, and that, breath."
932,_PART III._,
933,_PART III._,"And now the wreath was all completed, save"
934,_PART III._,"The mermaid blossom of all flowerdom,"
935,_PART III._,"A water-lily, dripping from the wave."
936,_PART III._,And 'twas in search of it that we had come
937,_PART III._,"Down to the lake, and wandered on the beach,"
938,_PART III._,To see if any lilies grew in reach.
939,_PART III._,"Some broken stalks, where flowers late had been;"
940,_PART III._,"Some buds, with all their beauties folded in,"
941,_PART III._,"We found, but not the treasure that we sought"
942,_PART III._,And then we turned our footsteps to the spot
943,_PART III._,"Where, all impatient of its chain, my boat,"
944,_PART III._,"""The Swan,"" rocked, asking to be set afloat"
945,_PART III._,"It was a dainty row-boat--strong, yet light;"
946,_PART III._,Each side a swan was painted snowy white:
947,_PART III._,"A present from my uncle, just before"
948,_PART III._,"He sailed, with Death, to that mysterious strand,"
949,_PART III._,"Where freighted ships go sailing evermore,"
950,_PART III._,But none return to tell us of the land.
951,_PART III._,
952,_PART III._,"I freed the ""Swan,"" and slowly rowed about,"
953,_PART III._,"Wherever sea-weeds, grass, or green leaves lifted"
954,_PART III._,"Their tips above the water. So we drifted,"
955,_PART III._,"While Helen, opposite, leaned idly out"
956,_PART III._,"And watched for lilies in the waves below,"
957,_PART III._,"And softly crooned some sweet and dreamy air,"
958,_PART III._,That soothed me like a mother's lullabies.
959,_PART III._,"I dropped the oars, and closed my sun-kissed eyes,"
960,_PART III._,And let the boat go drifting here and there.
961,_PART III._,"Oh, happy day! the last of that brief time"
962,_PART III._,"Of thoughtless youth, when all the world seems bright,"
963,_PART III._,Ere that disguisèd angel men call Woe
964,_PART III._,"Leads the sad heart through valleys dark as night,"
965,_PART III._,Up to the heights exalted and sublime.
966,_PART III._,"On each blest, happy moment, I am fain"
967,_PART III._,"To linger long, ere I pass on to pain"
968,_PART III._,And sorrow that succeeded.
969,_PART III._,
970,_PART III._,"From day-dreams,"
971,_PART III._,"As golden as the summer noontide's beams,"
972,_PART III._,I was awakened by a voice that cried:
973,_PART III._,"""Strange ship, ahoy! Fair frigate, whither bound?"""
974,_PART III._,"And, starting up, I cast my gaze around,"
975,_PART III._,And saw a sail-boat o'er the water glide
976,_PART III._,"Close to the ""Swan,"" like some live thing of grace;"
977,_PART III._,"And from it looked the glowing, handsome face"
978,_PART III._,Of Vivian.
979,_PART III._,
980,_PART III._,"""Beauteous sirens of the sea,"
981,_PART III._,"Come sail across the raging main with me!"""
982,_PART III._,"He laughed; and leaning, drew our drifting boat"
983,_PART III._,"Beside his own. ""There, now! step in!"" he said,"
984,_PART III._,"""I'll land you anywhere you want to go--"
985,_PART III._,"My boat is safer far than yours, I know:"
986,_PART III._,And much more pleasant with its sails all spread.
987,_PART III._,"The Swan? We'll take the oars, and let it float"
988,_PART III._,"Ashore at leisure. You, Maurine, sit there--"
989,_PART III._,Miss Helen here. Ye gods and little fishes!
990,_PART III._,"I've reached the height of pleasure, and my wishes."
991,_PART III._,"Adieu despondency! farewell to care!"""
992,_PART III._,
993,_PART III._,'T was done so quickly: that was Vivian's way.
994,_PART III._,He did not wait for either yea or nay.
995,_PART III._,"He gave commands, and left you with no choice"
996,_PART III._,But just to do the bidding of his voice.
997,_PART III._,"His rare, kind smile, low tones, and manly face"
998,_PART III._,Lent to his quick imperiousness a grace
999,_PART III._,"And winning charm, completely stripping it"
1000,_PART III._,Of what might otherwise have seemed unfit.
1001,_PART III._,"Leaving no trace of tyranny, but just"
1002,_PART III._,"That nameless force that seemed to say, ""You must."""
1003,_PART III._,"Suiting its pretty title of ""The Dawn,"""
1004,_PART III._,"(So named, he said, that it might rhyme with ""Swan,"")"
1005,_PART III._,"Vivian's sail-boat, was carpeted with blue,"
1006,_PART III._,While all its sails were of a pale rose hue.
1007,_PART III._,The daintiest craft that flirted with the breeze;
1008,_PART III._,A poet's fancy in an hour of ease.
1009,_PART III._,
1010,_PART III._,Whatever Vivian had was of the best.
1011,_PART III._,His room was like some Sultan's in the East.
1012,_PART III._,His board was always spread as for a feast.
1013,_PART III._,"Whereat, each meal, he was both host and guest."
1014,_PART III._,He would go hungry sooner than he'd dine
1015,_PART III._,At his own table if 'twere illy set.
1016,_PART III._,He so loved things artistic in design--
1017,_PART III._,"Order and beauty, all about him. Yet"
1018,_PART III._,"So kind he was, if it befell his lot"
1019,_PART III._,"To dine within the humble peasant's cot,"
1020,_PART III._,"He made it seem his native soil to be,"
1021,_PART III._,And thus displayed the true gentility.
1022,_PART III._,
1023,_PART III._,"Under the rosy banners of the ""Dawn,"""
1024,_PART III._,"Around the lake we drifted on, and on."
1025,_PART III._,"It was a time for dreams, and not for speech."
1026,_PART III._,"And so we floated on in silence, each"
1027,_PART III._,Weaving the fancies suiting such a day.
1028,_PART III._,"Helen leaned idly o'er the sail-boat's side,"
1029,_PART III._,And dipped her rosy fingers in the tide;
1030,_PART III._,"And I among the cushions half reclined,"
1031,_PART III._,"Half sat, and watched the fleecy clouds at play"
1032,_PART III._,"While Vivian with his blank-book, opposite,"
1033,_PART III._,In which he seemed to either sketch or write
1034,_PART III._,Was lost in inspiration of some kind.
1035,_PART III._,
1036,_PART III._,"No time, no change, no scene, can e'er efface"
1037,_PART III._,My mind's impression of that hour and place;
1038,_PART III._,"It stands out like a picture. O'er the years,"
1039,_PART III._,"Black with their robes of sorrow--veiled with tears,"
1040,_PART III._,"Lying with all their lengthened shapes between,"
1041,_PART III._,"Untouched, undimmed, I still behold that scene."
1042,_PART III._,"Just as the last of Indian-summer days,"
1043,_PART III._,"Replete with sunlight, crowned with amber haze,"
1044,_PART III._,"Followed by dark and desolate December,"
1045,_PART III._,Through all the months of winter we remember.
1046,_PART III._,
1047,_PART III._,The sun slipped westward. That peculiar change
1048,_PART III._,"Which creeps into the air, and speaks of night"
1049,_PART III._,"While yet the day is full of golden light,"
1050,_PART III._,We felt steal o'er us.
1051,_PART III._,Vivian broke the spell
1052,_PART III._,"Of dream-fraught silence, throwing down his book:"
1053,_PART III._,"""Young ladies, please allow me to arrange"
1054,_PART III._,These wraps about your shoulders. I know well
1055,_PART III._,"The fickle nature of our atmosphere,--"
1056,_PART III._,"Her smile swift followed by a frown or tear,--"
1057,_PART III._,"And go prepared for changes. Now you look,"
1058,_PART III._,"Like--like--oh, where's a pretty simile?"
1059,_PART III._,Had you a pocket mirror here you'd see
1060,_PART III._,How well my native talent is displayed
1061,_PART III._,In shawling you. Red on the brunette maid;
1062,_PART III._,Blue on the blonde--and quite without design
1063,_PART III._,"(Oh, where _is_ that comparison of mine?)"
1064,_PART III._,Well--like a June rose and a violet blue
1065,_PART III._,In one bouquet! I fancy that will do.
1066,_PART III._,"And now I crave your patience and a boon,"
1067,_PART III._,"Which is to listen, while I read my rhyme,"
1068,_PART III._,A floating fancy of the summer time.
1069,_PART III._,"'Tis neither witty, wonderful, nor wise,"
1070,_PART III._,So listen kindly--but don't criticise
1071,_PART III._,My maiden effort of the afternoon:
1072,_PART III._,
1073,_PART III._,"""If all the ships I have at sea"
1074,_PART III._,"Should come a-sailing home to me,"
1075,_PART III._,"Ah, well! the harbor could not hold"
1076,_PART III._,So many sails as there would be
1077,_PART III._,If all my ships came in from sea.
1078,_PART III._,
1079,_PART III._,"""If half my ships came home from sea,"
1080,_PART III._,"And brought their precious freight to me,"
1081,_PART III._,"Ah, well! I should have wealth as great"
1082,_PART III._,As any king who sits in state--
1083,_PART III._,So rich the treasures that would be
1084,_PART III._,In half my ships now out at sea.
1085,_PART III._,
1086,_PART III._,"""If just one ship I have at sea"
1087,_PART III._,"Should come a-sailing home to me,"
1088,_PART III._,"Ah, well! the storm-clouds then might frown:"
1089,_PART III._,For if the others all went down
1090,_PART III._,"Still rich and proud and glad I'd be,"
1091,_PART III._,If that one ship came back to me.
1092,_PART III._,
1093,_PART III._,"""If that one ship went down at sea,"
1094,_PART III._,"And all the others came to me,"
1095,_PART III._,"Weighed down with gems and wealth untold,"
1096,_PART III._,"With glory, honor, riches, gold,"
1097,_PART III._,The poorest soul on earth I'd be

1100,_PART III._,"""O skies be calm? O winds blow free--"
1101,_PART III._,Blow all my ships safe home to me.
1102,_PART III._,But if thou sendest some a-wrack
1103,_PART III._,"To never more come sailing back,"
1104,_PART III._,"Send any--all, that skim the sea,"
1105,_PART III._,"But bring my love-ship home to me."""
1106,_PART III._,
1107,_PART III._,"Helen was leaning by me, and her head"
1108,_PART III._,"Rested against my shoulder: as he read,"
1109,_PART III._,"I stroked her hair, and watched the fleecy skies,"
1110,_PART III._,"And when he finished, did not turn my eyes."
1111,_PART III._,I felt too happy and too shy to meet
1112,_PART III._,"His gaze just then. I said, ""'Tis very sweet,"
1113,_PART III._,"And suits the day; does it not, Helen, dear?"""
1114,_PART III._,"But Helen, voiceless, did not seem to hear."
1115,_PART III._,"""'Tis strange,"" I added, ""how you poets sing"

1119,_PART III._,"Now, to a listener, your love song seemed"
1120,_PART III._,A heart's out-pouring; yet I've heard you say

1123,_PART III._,"Gained without loss of conscience or good name,"
1124,_PART III._,"The things to live for."""

1126,_PART III._,"Laughed Vivian, ""but 'twas years--or months ago!"
1127,_PART III._,"And Solomon says wise men change, you know!"
1128,_PART III._,I now speak truth! if she I hold most dear
1129,_PART III._,"Slipped from my life, and no least hope were left,"
1130,_PART III._,My heart would find the years more lonely here.
1131,_PART III._,"Than if I were of wealth, fame, friends, bereft,"
1132,_PART III._,"And sent an exile to a foreign land."""
1133,_PART III._,
1134,_PART III._,"His voice was low, and measured: as he spoke,"
1135,_PART III._,"New, unknown chords of melody awoke"
1136,_PART III._,Within my soul. I felt my heart expand
1137,_PART III._,With that sweet fullness born of love. I turned
1138,_PART III._,"To hide the blushes on my cheek that burned,"
1139,_PART III._,"And leaning over Helen, breathed her name."
1140,_PART III._,She lay so motionless I thought she slept:
1141,_PART III._,"But, as I spoke, I saw her eyes unclose,"
1142,_PART III._,"And o'er her face a sudden glory swept,"
1143,_PART III._,And a slight tremor thrilled all through her frame.
1144,_PART III._,"""Sweet friend,"" I said, ""your face is full of light:"
1145,_PART III._,"What were the dreams that made your eyes so bright?"""
1146,_PART III._,
1147,_PART III._,"She only smiled for answer, and arose"
1148,_PART III._,"From her reclining posture at my side,"
1149,_PART III._,Threw back the clust'ring ringlets from her face
1150,_PART III._,"With a quick gesture, full of easy grace,"
1151,_PART III._,"And, turning, spoke to Vivian. ""Will you guide"
1152,_PART III._,The boat up near that little clump of green
1153,_PART III._,Off to the right? There's where the lilies grow.
1154,_PART III._,"We quite forgot our errand here, Maurine,"
1155,_PART III._,And our few moments have grown into hours.
1156,_PART III._,What will Aunt Ruth think of our ling'ring so?
1157,_PART III._,"There--that will do--now I can reach the flowers."""
1158,_PART III._,
1159,_PART III._,"""Hark! just hear that!"" and Vivian broke forth singing,"
1160,_PART III._,"""Row, brothers, row."" ""The six o'clock bell's ringing!"
1161,_PART III._,Who ever knew three hours to go so fast
1162,_PART III._,"In all the annals of the world, before?"
1163,_PART III._,I could have sworn not over one had passed.
1164,_PART III._,"Young ladies, I am forced to go ashore!"
1165,_PART III._,I thank you for the pleasure you have given;
1166,_PART III._,This afternoon has been a glimpse of heaven.
1167,_PART III._,"Good night--sweet dreams! and by your gracious leave,"
1168,_PART III._,"I'll pay my compliments to-morrow eve."""
1169,_PART III._,
1170,_PART III._,"A smile, a bow, and he had gone his way:"
1171,_PART III._,"And, in the waning glory of the day,"
1172,_PART III._,"Down cool, green lanes, and through the length'ning shadows,"
1173,_PART III._,"Silent, we wandered back across the meadows."
1174,_PART III._,"The wreath was finished, and adorned my room;"
1175,_PART III._,"Long afterward, the lilies' copied bloom"
1176,_PART III._,"Was like a horrid specter in my sight,"
1177,_PART III._,"Staring upon me morning, noon, and night."
1178,_PART III._,
1179,_PART III._,"The sun went down. The sad new moon rose up,"
1180,_PART III._,"And passed before me, like an empty cup,"
1181,_PART III._,"The Great Unseen brims full of pain or bliss,"
1182,_PART III._,"And gives His children, saying, ""Drink of this."""
1183,_PART III._,
1184,_PART III._,"A light wind, from the open casement, fanned"
1185,_PART III._,"My brow and Helen's, as we, hand in hand,"
1186,_PART III._,"Sat looking out upon the twilight scene,"
1187,_PART III._,"In dreamy silence. Helen's dark blue eyes,"
1188,_PART III._,Like two lost stars that wandered from the skies
1189,_PART III._,"Some night adown the meteor's shining track,"
1190,_PART III._,"And always had been grieving to go back,"
1191,_PART III._,"Now gazed up, wistfully, at heaven's dome,"
1192,_PART III._,And seemed to recognize and long for home.
1193,_PART III._,"Her sweet voice broke the silence: ""Wish, Maurine,"
1194,_PART III._,"Before you speak! you know the moon is new,"
1195,_PART III._,And anything you wish for will come true
1196,_PART III._,Before it wanes. I do believe the sign!
1197,_PART III._,"Now tell me your wish, and I'll tell you mine."""
1198,_PART III._,
1199,_PART III._,I turned and looked up at the slim young moon;
1200,_PART III._,"And, with an almost superstitious heart,"
1201,_PART III._,"I sighed, ""Oh, new moon! help me, by thine art,"
1202,_PART III._,"To grow all grace and goodness, and to be"
1203,_PART III._,"Worthy the love a true heart proffers me."""
1204,_PART III._,"Then smiling down, I said, ""Dear one! my boon,"
1205,_PART III._,"I fear, is quite too silly or too sweet"
1206,_PART III._,For my repeating: so we'll let it stay
1207,_PART III._,Between the moon and me. But if I may
1208,_PART III._,"I'll listen now to your wish. Tell me, please!"""
1209,_PART III._,
1210,_PART III._,"All suddenly she nestled at my feet,"
1211,_PART III._,And hid her blushing face upon my knees.
1212,_PART III._,"Then drew my hand against her glowing cheek,"
1213,_PART III._,"And, leaning on my breast, began to speak,"
1214,_PART III._,Half sighing out the words my tortured ear
1215,_PART III._,"Reached down to catch, while striving not to hear."
1216,_PART III._,
1217,_PART III._,"""Can you not guess who 'twas about, Maurine?"
1218,_PART III._,"Oh, my sweet friend! you must ere this have seen"
1219,_PART III._,The love I tried to cover from all eyes
1220,_PART III._,"And from myself. Ah, foolish little heart!"
1221,_PART III._,As well it might go seeking for some art
1222,_PART III._,Whereby to hide the sun in noonday skies.
1223,_PART III._,"When first the strange sound of his voice I heard,"
1224,_PART III._,"Looked on his noble face, and touched his hand,"
1225,_PART III._,"My slumb'ring heart thrilled through and through, and stirred"
1226,_PART III._,"As if to say, 'I hear, and understand.'"
1227,_PART III._,And day by day mine eyes were blest beholding
1228,_PART III._,"The inner beauty of his life, unfolding"
1229,_PART III._,"In countless words and actions, that portrayed"
1230,_PART III._,The noble stuff of which his soul was made.
1231,_PART III._,And more and more I felt my heart upreaching
1232,_PART III._,"Toward the truth, drawn gently by his teaching,"
1233,_PART III._,As flowers are drawn by sunlight. And there grew
1234,_PART III._,"A strange, shy something in its depths, I knew"
1235,_PART III._,"At length was love, because it was so sad,"
1236,_PART III._,"And yet so sweet, and made my heart so glad,"
1237,_PART III._,
1238,_PART III._,"Yet seemed to pain me. Then, for very shame,"
1239,_PART III._,Lest all should read my secret and its name.
1240,_PART III._,"I strove to hide it in my breast away,"
1241,_PART III._,Where God could see it only. But each day
1242,_PART III._,"It seemed to grow within me, and would rise,"
1243,_PART III._,"Like my own soul, and look forth from my eyes,"
1244,_PART III._,"Defying bonds of silence; and would speak,"
1245,_PART III._,"In its red-lettered language, on my cheek,"
1246,_PART III._,"If but his name was uttered. You were kind,"
1247,_PART III._,"My own Maurine! as you alone could be,"
1248,_PART III._,"So long the sharer of my heart and mind,"
1249,_PART III._,"While yet you saw, in seeming not to see."
1250,_PART III._,"In all the years we have been friends, my own."
1251,_PART III._,"And loved as women very rarely do,"
1252,_PART III._,My heart no sorrow and no joy has known
1253,_PART III._,"It has not shared at once, in full, with you"
1254,_PART III._,"And I so longed to speak to you of this,"
1255,_PART III._,When first I felt its mingled pain and bliss;
1256,_PART III._,"Yet dared not, lest you, knowing him, should say,"
1257,_PART III._,In pity for my folly--'Lack-a-day!
1258,_PART III._,You are undone: because no mortal art
1259,_PART III._,Can win the love of such a lofty heart.'
1260,_PART III._,"And so I waited, silent and in pain,"
1261,_PART III._,Till I could know I did not love in vain.
1262,_PART III._,"And now I know, beyond a doubt or fear."
1263,_PART III._,"Did he not say, 'If she I hold most dear"
1264,_PART III._,"Slipped from my life, and no least hope were left,"
1265,_PART III._,My heart would find the years more lonely here
1266,_PART III._,"Than if I were of wealth, fame, friends, bereft,"
1267,_PART III._,"And sent, an exile, to a foreign land'?"
1268,_PART III._,"Oh, darling, you must _love_, to understand"
1269,_PART III._,The joy that thrilled all through me at those words.
1270,_PART III._,It was as if a thousand singing birds
1271,_PART III._,Within my heart broke forth in notes of praise.
1272,_PART III._,"I did not look up, but I knew his gaze"
1273,_PART III._,"Was on my face, and that his eyes must see"
1274,_PART III._,The joy I felt almost transfigured me.
1275,_PART III._,"He loves me--loves me! so the birds kept singing,"
1276,_PART III._,And all my soul with that sweet strain is ringing.
1277,_PART III._,"If there were added but one drop of bliss,"
1278,_PART III._,"No more my cup would hold: and so, this eve,"
1279,_PART III._,I made a wish that I might feel his kiss
1280,_PART III._,"Upon my lips, ere yon pale moon should leave"
1281,_PART III._,"The stars all lonely, having waned away,"
1282,_PART III._,"Too old and weak and bowed with care to stay."""
1283,_PART III._,
1284,_PART III._,Her voice sighed into silence. While she spoke
1285,_PART III._,"My heart writhed in me, praying she would cease--"
1286,_PART III._,Each word she uttered falling like a stroke
1287,_PART III._,"On my bare soul. And now a hush like death,"
1288,_PART III._,"Save that 'twas broken by a quick-drawn breath,"
1289,_PART III._,"Fell 'round me, but brought not the hoped-for peace."
1290,_PART III._,"For when the lash no longer leaves its blows,"
1291,_PART III._,"The flesh still quivers, and the blood still flows."
1292,_PART III._,
1293,_PART III._,She nestled on my bosom like a child.
1294,_PART III._,And 'neath her head my tortured heart throbbed wild
1295,_PART III._,With pain and pity. She had told her tale--
1296,_PART III._,Her self-deceiving story to the end.
1297,_PART III._,How could I look down on her as she lay
1298,_PART III._,"So fair, and sweet, and lily-like, and frail--"
1299,_PART III._,"A tender blossom on my breast, and say,"
1300,_PART III._,"""Nay, you are wrong--you do mistake, dear friend!"
1301,_PART III._,"'Tis I am loved, not you""? Yet that were truth,"
1302,_PART III._,And she must know it later.
1303,_PART III._,"Should I speak,"
1304,_PART III._,And spread a ghastly pallor o'er the cheek
1305,_PART III._,"Flushed now with joy?--And while I, doubting, pondered,"
1306,_PART III._,"She spoke again. ""Maurine! I oft have wondered"
1307,_PART III._,Why you and Vivian were not lovers. He
1308,_PART III._,Is all a heart could ask its king to be;
1309,_PART III._,"And you have beauty, intellect and youth."
1310,_PART III._,I think it strange you have not loved each other--
1311,_PART III._,Strange how he could pass by you for another
1312,_PART III._,Not half so fair or worthy. Yet I know
1313,_PART III._,A loving Father pre-arranged it so.
1314,_PART III._,"I think my heart has known him all these years,"
1315,_PART III._,And waited for him. And if when he came
1316,_PART III._,"It had been as a lover of my friend,"
1317,_PART III._,"I should have recognized him, all the same,"
1318,_PART III._,"As my soul-mate, and loved him to the end,"
1319,_PART III._,"Hiding my grief, and forcing back my tears"
1320,_PART III._,"Till on my heart, slow dropping, day by day,"
1321,_PART III._,"Unseen they fell, and wore it all away."
1322,_PART III._,"And so a tender Father kept him free,"
1323,_PART III._,"With all the largeness of his love, for me--"
1324,_PART III._,"For me, unworthy such a precious gift!"
1325,_PART III._,Yet I will bend each effort of my life
1326,_PART III._,"To grow in grace and goodness, and to lift"
1327,_PART III._,"My soul and spirit to his lofty height,"
1328,_PART III._,"So to deserve that holy name, his wife."
1329,_PART III._,"Sweet friend, it fills my whole heart with delight"
1330,_PART III._,To breathe its long hid secret in your ear.
1331,_PART III._,"Speak, my Maurine, and say you love to hear!"""
1332,_PART III._,"The while she spoke, my active brain gave rise"
1333,_PART III._,To one great thought of mighty sacrifice
1334,_PART III._,"And self-denial. Oh! it blanched my cheek,"
1335,_PART III._,And wrung my soul; and from my heart it drove
1336,_PART III._,"All life and feeling. Coward-like, I strove"
1337,_PART III._,To send it from me; but I felt it cling
1338,_PART III._,And hold fast on my mind like some live thing;
1339,_PART III._,And all the Self within me felt its touch
1340,_PART III._,"And cried, ""No, no! I cannot do so much--"
1341,_PART III._,"I am not strong enough--there is no call."""
1342,_PART III._,"And then the voice of Helen bade me speak,"
1343,_PART III._,"And with a calmness born of nerve, I said,"
1344,_PART III._,"Scarce knowing what I uttered, ""Sweetheart, all"
1345,_PART III._,Your joys and sorrows are with mine own wed.
1346,_PART III._,"I thank you for your confidence, and pray"
1347,_PART III._,"I may deserve it always. But, dear one,"
1348,_PART III._,"Something--perhaps our boat-ride in the sun,"
1349,_PART III._,Has set my head to aching. I must go
1350,_PART III._,"To bed directly; and you will, I know,"
1351,_PART III._,"Grant me your pardon, and another day"
1352,_PART III._,We'll talk of this together. Now good night
1353,_PART III._,"And angels guard you with their wings of light."""
1354,_PART III._,
1355,_PART III._,"I kissed her lips, and held her on my heart,"
1356,_PART III._,And viewed her as I ne'er had done before.
1357,_PART III._,I gazed upon her features o'er and o'er;
1358,_PART III._,"Marked her white, tender face--her fragile form,"
1359,_PART III._,Like some frail plant that withers in the storm;
1360,_PART III._,Saw she was fairer in her new-found joy
1361,_PART III._,"Than e'er before; and thought, ""Can I destroy"
1362,_PART III._,"God's handiwork, or leave it at the best"
1363,_PART III._,"A broken harp, while I close clasp my bliss?"""
1364,_PART III._,"I bent my head and gave her one last kiss,"
1365,_PART III._,"And sought my room, and found there such relief"
1366,_PART III._,As sad hearts feel when first alone with grief.
1367,_PART III._,
1368,_PART III._,"The moon went down, slow sailing from my sight,"
1369,_PART III._,And left the stars to watch away the night.
1370,_PART III._,"O stars, sweet stars, so changeless and serene!"
1371,_PART III._,What depths of woe your pitying eyes have seen!
1372,_PART III._,"The proud sun sets, and leaves us with our sorrow,"
1373,_PART III._,To grope alone in darkness till the morrow.
1374,_PART III._,"The languid moon, e'en if she deigns to rise,"
1375,_PART III._,"Soon seeks her couch, grown weary of our sighs;"
1376,_PART III._,But from the early gloaming till the day
1377,_PART III._,Sends golden-liveried heralds forth to say
1378,_PART III._,"He comes in might; the patient stars shine on,"
1379,_PART III._,"Steadfast and faithful, from twilight to dawn."
1380,_PART III._,"And, as they shone upon Gethsemane,"
1381,_PART III._,"And watched the struggle of a God-like soul,"
1382,_PART III._,"Now from the same far height they shone on me,"
1383,_PART III._,And saw the waves of anguish o'er me roll.
1384,_PART III._,
1385,_PART III._,The storm had come upon me all unseen:
1386,_PART III._,No sound of thunder fell upon my ear;
1387,_PART III._,No cloud arose to tell me it was near;
1388,_PART III._,"But under skies all sunlit, and serene,"
1389,_PART III._,"I floated with the current of the stream,"
1390,_PART III._,And thought life all one golden-haloed dream.
1391,_PART III._,"When lo! a hurricane, with awful force,"
1392,_PART III._,"Swept swift upon its devastating course,"
1393,_PART III._,"Wrecked my frail bark, and cast me on the wave"
1394,_PART III._,Where all my hopes had found a sudden grave.
1395,_PART III._,Love makes us blind and selfish: otherwise
1396,_PART III._,I had seen Helen's secret in her eyes;
1397,_PART III._,So used I was to reading every look
1398,_PART III._,"In her sweet face, as I would read a book."
1399,_PART III._,"But now, made sightless by love's blinding rays,"
1400,_PART III._,"I had gone on unseeing, to the end"
1401,_PART III._,Where Pain dispelled the mist of golden haze
1402,_PART III._,"That walled me in, and lo! I found my friend"
1403,_PART III._,"Who journeyed with me--at my very side,"
1404,_PART III._,"Had been sore wounded to the heart, while I"
1405,_PART III._,"Both deaf and blind, saw not, nor heard her cry."
1406,_PART III._,"And then I sobbed, ""O God! I would have died"
1407,_PART III._,"To save her this."" And as I cried in pain,"
1408,_PART III._,"There leaped forth from the still, white realm of Thought"
1409,_PART III._,"Where Conscience dwells, that unimpassioned spot"
1410,_PART III._,As widely different from the heart's domain
1411,_PART III._,"As north from south--the impulse felt before,"
1412,_PART III._,"And put away; but now it rose once more,"
1413,_PART III._,"In greater strength, and said, ""Heart, would'st thou prove"
1414,_PART III._,What lips have uttered? Then go lay thy love
1415,_PART III._,"On Friendship's altar, as thy offering."""
1416,_PART III._,"""Nay!"" cried my heart, ""ask any other thing--"
1417,_PART III._,Ask life itself--'twere easier sacrifice.
1418,_PART III._,"But ask not love, for that I cannot give."""
1419,_PART III._,
1420,_PART III._,"""But,"" spoke the voice, ""the meanest insect dies,"
1421,_PART III._,And is no hero! heroes dare to live
1422,_PART III._,"When all that makes life sweet is snatched away."""
1423,_PART III._,"So with my heart, in converse, till the day"
1424,_PART III._,"In gold and crimson billows, rose and broke,"
1425,_PART III._,"The voice of Conscience, all unwearied, spoke."
1426,_PART III._,"Love warred with Friendship: heart with Conscience fought,"
1427,_PART III._,"Hours rolled away, and yet the end was not."
1428,_PART III._,"And wily Self, tricked out like tenderness,"
1429,_PART III._,"Sighed, ""Think how one, whose life thou wert to bless,"
1430,_PART III._,"Will be cast down, and grope in doubt and fear!"
1431,_PART III._,"Wouldst thou wound him, to give thy friend relief?"
1432,_PART III._,"Can wrong make right?"""
1433,_PART III._,"""Nay!"" Conscience said, ""but Pride"
1434,_PART III._,And Time can heal the saddest hurts of Love.
1435,_PART III._,"While Friendship's wounds gape wide and yet more wide,"
1436,_PART III._,"And bitter fountains of the spirit prove."""
1437,_PART III._,
1438,_PART III._,"At length, exhausted with the wearing strife,"
1439,_PART III._,I cast the new-found burden of my life
1440,_PART III._,"On God's broad breast, and sought that deep repose"
1441,_PART III._,That only he who watched with sorrow knows.
1442,_PART III._,
1443,_PART III._,
1444,_PART IV._,_PART IV._
1445,_PART IV._,
1446,_PART IV._,"""Maurine, Maurine! 'tis ten o'clock! arise,"
1447,_PART IV._,"My pretty sluggard! open those dark eyes,"
1448,_PART IV._,And see where yonder sun is! Do you know
1449,_PART IV._,"I made my toilet just four hours ago?"""
1450,_PART IV._,
1451,_PART IV._,'T was Helen's voice: and Helen's gentle kiss
1452,_PART IV._,"Fell on my cheek. As from a deep abyss,"
1453,_PART IV._,I drew my weary self from that strange sleep
1454,_PART IV._,"That rests not, nor refreshes. Scarce awake"
1455,_PART IV._,"Or conscious, yet there seemed a heavy weight"
1456,_PART IV._,"Bound on my breast, as by a cruel Fate."
1457,_PART IV._,"I knew not why, and yet I longed to weep."
1458,_PART IV._,Some dark cloud seemed to hang upon the day;
1459,_PART IV._,"And, for a moment, in that trance I lay,"
1460,_PART IV._,"When suddenly the truth did o'er me break,"
1461,_PART IV._,Like some great wave upon a helpless child.
1462,_PART IV._,The dull pain in my breast grew like a knife--
1463,_PART IV._,"The heavy throbbing of my heart grew wild,"
1464,_PART IV._,And God gave back the burden of the life
1465,_PART IV._,He kept what time I slumbered.
1466,_PART IV._,"""You are ill,"""
1467,_PART IV._,"Cried Helen, ""with that blinding headache still!"
1468,_PART IV._,You look so pale and weary. Now let me
1469,_PART IV._,"Play nurse, Maurine, and care for you to-day!"
1470,_PART IV._,"And first I'll suit some dainty to your taste,"
1471,_PART IV._,"And bring it to you, with a cup of tea."""
1472,_PART IV._,"And off she ran, not waiting my reply."
1473,_PART IV._,"But, wanting most the sunshine and the light,"
1474,_PART IV._,"I left my couch, and clothed myself in haste,"
1475,_PART IV._,"And, kneeling, sent to God an earnest cry"
1476,_PART IV._,For help and guidance.
1477,_PART IV._,"""Show Thou me the way,"
1478,_PART IV._,Where duty leads; for I am blind! my sight
1479,_PART IV._,"Obscured by self. Oh, lead my steps aright!"
1480,_PART IV._,"Help me see the path: and if it may,"
1481,_PART IV._,Let this cup pass:--and yet Thou heavenly One
1482,_PART IV._,"Thy will in all things, not mine own, be done."""
1483,_PART IV._,"Rising, I went upon my way, receiving"
1484,_PART IV._,The strength prayer gives alway to hearts believing.
1485,_PART IV._,"I felt that unseen hands were leading me,"
1486,_PART IV._,And knew the end was peace.
1487,_PART IV._,"""What! are you up?"""
1488,_PART IV._,"Cried Helen, coming with a tray, and cup,"
1489,_PART IV._,"Of tender toast, and fragrant smoking tea."
1490,_PART IV._,"""You naughty girl! you should have stayed in bed"
1491,_PART IV._,"Until you ate your breakfast, and were better"
1492,_PART IV._,I've something hidden for you here--a letter.
1493,_PART IV._,"But drink your tea before you read it, dear!"
1494,_PART IV._,"'Tis from some distant cousin, Auntie said,"
1495,_PART IV._,"And so you need not hurry. Now be good,"
1496,_PART IV._,"And mind your Helen."""
1497,_PART IV._,"So, in passive mood,"
1498,_PART IV._,"I laid the still unopened letter near,"
1499,_PART IV._,And loitered at my breakfast more to please
1500,_PART IV._,"My nurse, than any hunger to appease."
1501,_PART IV._,Then listlessly I broke the seal and read
1502,_PART IV._,The few lines written in a bold free hand:
1503,_PART IV._,"""New London, Canada. Dear Coz. Maurine!"
1504,_PART IV._,(In spite of generations stretched between
1505,_PART IV._,Our natural right to that most handy claim
1506,_PART IV._,"Of cousinship, we'll use it all the same)"
1507,_PART IV._,"I'm coming to see you! honestly, in truth!"
1508,_PART IV._,I've threatened often--now I mean to act.
1509,_PART IV._,You'll find my coming is a stubborn fact.
1510,_PART IV._,"Keep quiet though, and do not tell Aunt Ruth"
1511,_PART IV._,I wonder if she'll know her petted boy
1512,_PART IV._,In spite of changes. Look for me until
1513,_PART IV._,You see me coming. As of old I'm still
1514,_PART IV._,"Your faithful friend, and loving cousin, Roy."""
1515,_PART IV._,
1516,_PART IV._,So Roy was coming! He and I had played
1517,_PART IV._,"As boy and girl, and later, youth and maid,"
1518,_PART IV._,"Full half our lives together. He had been,"
1519,_PART IV._,"Like me, an orphan; and the roof of kin"
1520,_PART IV._,Gave both kind shelter. Swift years sped away
1521,_PART IV._,Ere change was felt: and then one summer day
1522,_PART IV._,A long lost uncle sailed from India's shore--
1523,_PART IV._,"Made Roy his heir, and he was ours no more."
1524,_PART IV._,
1525,_PART IV._,"""He'd write us daily, and we'd see his face"
1526,_PART IV._,"Once every year."" Such was his promise given"
1527,_PART IV._,The morn he left. But now the years were seven
1528,_PART IV._,Since last he looked upon the olden place.
1529,_PART IV._,"He'd been through college, traveled in all lands,"
1530,_PART IV._,"Sailed over seas, and trod the desert sands."
1531,_PART IV._,"Would write and plan a visit, then, ere long,"
1532,_PART IV._,Would write again from Egypt or Hong Kong--
1533,_PART IV._,Some fancy called him thither unforeseen.
1534,_PART IV._,"So years had passed, till seven lay between"
1535,_PART IV._,"His going and the coming of this note,"
1536,_PART IV._,"Which I hid in my bosom, and replied"
1537,_PART IV._,"To Aunt Ruth's queries, ""What the truant wrote?"""
1538,_PART IV._,"By saying he was still upon the wing,"
1539,_PART IV._,"And merely dropped a line, while journeying,"
1540,_PART IV._,To say he lived: and she was satisfied.
1541,_PART IV._,
1542,_PART IV._,"Sometimes it happens, in this world so strange,"
1543,_PART IV._,"A human heart will pass through mortal strife,"
1544,_PART IV._,And writhe in torture: while the old sweet life
1545,_PART IV._,"So full of hope, and beauty, bloom and grace,"
1546,_PART IV._,Is slowly strangled by remorseless Pain:
1547,_PART IV._,"And one stern, cold, relentless, takes its place--"
1548,_PART IV._,"A ghastly, pallid specter of the slain."
1549,_PART IV._,Yet those in daily converse see no change
1550,_PART IV._,Nor dream the heart has suffered.
1551,_PART IV._,So that day
1552,_PART IV._,I passed along toward the troubled way
1553,_PART IV._,"Stern duty pointed, and no mortal guessed"
1554,_PART IV._,A mighty conflict had disturbed my breast.
1555,_PART IV._,
1556,_PART IV._,I had resolved to yield up to my friend
1557,_PART IV._,"The man I loved. Since she, too, loved him so"
1558,_PART IV._,I saw no other way in honor left.
1559,_PART IV._,"She was so weak and fragile, once bereft"
1560,_PART IV._,"Of this great hope, that held her with such power"
1561,_PART IV._,"She would wilt down, like some frost-bitten flower"
1562,_PART IV._,And swift untimely death would be the end.
1563,_PART IV._,"But I was strong: and hardy plants, which grow"
1564,_PART IV._,"In out-door soil, can bear bleak winds that blow"
1565,_PART IV._,"From Arctic lands, whereof a single breath"
1566,_PART IV._,Would lay the hot-house blossom low in death.
1567,_PART IV._,
1568,_PART IV._,"The hours went by, too slow, and yet too fast."
1569,_PART IV._,All day I argued with my foolish heart
1570,_PART IV._,That bade me play the shrinking coward's part
1571,_PART IV._,And hide from pain. And when the day had past
1572,_PART IV._,"And time for Vivian's call drew near and nearer,"
1573,_PART IV._,"It pleaded. ""Wait, until the way seems clearer:"
1574,_PART IV._,Say you are ill--or busy: keep away
1575,_PART IV._,Until you gather strength enough to play
1576,_PART IV._,"The part you have resolved on."""
1577,_PART IV._,
1578,_PART IV._,"""Nay, not so,"""
1579,_PART IV._,"Made answer clear-eyed Reason, ""Do you go"
1580,_PART IV._,And put your resolution to the test.
1581,_PART IV._,"Resolve, however nobly formed, at best"
1582,_PART IV._,"Is but a still born babe of Thought, until"
1583,_PART IV._,It proves existence of its life and will
1584,_PART IV._,"By sound or action."""
1585,_PART IV._,So when Helen came
1586,_PART IV._,"And knelt by me, her fair face all aflame"
1587,_PART IV._,"With sudden blushes, whispering, ""My sweet!"
1588,_PART IV._,My heart can hear the music of his feet--
1589,_PART IV._,"Go down with me to meet him,"" I arose,"
1590,_PART IV._,"And went with her all calmly, as one goes"
1591,_PART IV._,To look upon the dear face of the dead.
1592,_PART IV._,
1593,_PART IV._,"That eve, I know not what I did or said."
1594,_PART IV._,I was not cold--my manner was not strange:
1595,_PART IV._,"Perchance I talked more freely than my wont,"
1596,_PART IV._,But in my speech was naught could give affront;
1597,_PART IV._,"Yet I conveyed, as only woman can,"
1598,_PART IV._,"That nameless _something_, which bespeaks a change."
1599,_PART IV._,
1600,_PART IV._,"'Tis in the power of woman, if she be"
1601,_PART IV._,"Whole-souled and noble, free from coquetry--"
1602,_PART IV._,"Her motives all unselfish, worthy, good,"
1603,_PART IV._,To make herself and feelings understood
1604,_PART IV._,"By nameless acts--thus sparing what to man,"
1605,_PART IV._,"However gently answered, causes pain,"
1606,_PART IV._,The offering of his hand and heart in vain.
1607,_PART IV._,
1608,_PART IV._,"She can be friendly, unrestrained, and kind,"
1609,_PART IV._,Assume no airs of pride or arrogance;
1610,_PART IV._,"But in her voice, her manner, and her glance,"
1611,_PART IV._,"Convey that mystic something, undefined,"
1612,_PART IV._,"Which men fail not to understand and read,"
1613,_PART IV._,"And, when not blind with egoism, heed."
1614,_PART IV._,My task was harder. 'T was the slow undoing
1615,_PART IV._,Of long sweet months of unimpeded wooing.
1616,_PART IV._,It was to hide and cover and conceal
1617,_PART IV._,"The truth--assuming, what I did not feel."
1618,_PART IV._,It was to dam love's happy singing tide
1619,_PART IV._,"That blessed me with its hopeful, tuneful tone,"
1620,_PART IV._,"By feigned indiff'rence, till it turned aside,"
1621,_PART IV._,"And changed its channel, leaving me alone"
1622,_PART IV._,"To walk parched plains, and thirst for that sweet draught"
1623,_PART IV._,"My lips had tasted, but another quaffed."
1624,_PART IV._,It could be done. For no words yet were spoken--
1625,_PART IV._,None to recall--no pledges to be broken.
1626,_PART IV._,"""He will be grieved, then angry, cold, then cross,"""
1627,_PART IV._,"I reasoned, thinking what would be his part"
1628,_PART IV._,"In this strange drama. ""Then, because his he"
1629,_PART IV._,"Feels something lacking, to make good his loss,"
1630,_PART IV._,He'll turn to Helen: and her gentle grace
1631,_PART IV._,And loving acts will win her soon the place
1632,_PART IV._,I hold to-day: and like a troubled dream
1633,_PART IV._,"At length, our past, when he looks back, will seem."""
1634,_PART IV._,"That evening passed with music, chat and song:"
1635,_PART IV._,But hours that once had flown on airy wings
1636,_PART IV._,"Now limped on weary, aching limbs along,"
1637,_PART IV._,Each moment like some dreaded step that brings
1638,_PART IV._,A twinge of pain.
1639,_PART IV._,"As Vivian rose to go,"
1640,_PART IV._,"Slow bending to me, from his greater height,"
1641,_PART IV._,"He took my hand, and, looking in my eyes,"
1642,_PART IV._,"With tender questioning and pained surprise,"
1643,_PART IV._,"Said, ""Maurine, you are not yourself to-night!"
1644,_PART IV._,"What is it? Are you ailing?"""
1645,_PART IV._,"""Ailing? no,"""
1646,_PART IV._,"I answered, laughing lightly, ""I am not:"
1647,_PART IV._,"Just see my cheek, sir! is it thin, or pale?"
1648,_PART IV._,"Now tell me, am I looking very frail?"""
1649,_PART IV._,"""Nay, nay!"" he answered, ""it can not be _seen_,"
1650,_PART IV._,The change I speak of--'twas more in your mien:
1651,_PART IV._,"Preoccupation, or--I know not what!"
1652,_PART IV._,"Miss Helen, am I wrong, or does Maurine"
1653,_PART IV._,"Seem to have something on her mind this eve?"""
1654,_PART IV._,"""She does!"" laughed Helen, ""and I do believe"
1655,_PART IV._,I know what 'tis! A letter came to-day
1656,_PART IV._,"Which she read slyly, and then hid away"
1657,_PART IV._,"Close to her heart, not knowing I was near:"
1658,_PART IV._,And since she's been as you have seen her here.
1659,_PART IV._,See how she blushes! so my random shot
1660,_PART IV._,"We must believe has struck a tender spot."""
1661,_PART IV._,
1662,_PART IV._,"Her rippling laughter floated through the room,"
1663,_PART IV._,"And redder yet I felt the hot blood rise,"
1664,_PART IV._,"Then surge away to leave me pale as death,"
1665,_PART IV._,Under the dark and swiftly gathering gloom
1666,_PART IV._,"Of Vivian's questioning, accusing eyes,"
1667,_PART IV._,That searched my soul. I almost shrieked beneath
1668,_PART IV._,"That stern, fixed gaze; and stood spellbound until"
1669,_PART IV._,"He turned with sudden movement, gave his hand"
1670,_PART IV._,"To each in turn, and said, ""You must not stand"
1671,_PART IV._,"Longer, young ladies, in this open door."
1672,_PART IV._,The air is heavy with a cold damp chill.
1673,_PART IV._,"We shall have rain to-morrow, or before."
1674,_PART IV._,"Good night."""
1675,_PART IV._,He vanished in the darkling shade;
1676,_PART IV._,"And so the dreaded evening found an end,"
1677,_PART IV._,"That saw me grasp the conscience-whetted blade,"
1678,_PART IV._,And strike a blow for honor and for friend.
1679,_PART IV._,
1680,_PART IV._,"""How swiftly passed the evening!"" Helen sighed."
1681,_PART IV._,"""How long the hours!"" my tortured heart replied."
1682,_PART IV._,"Joy, like a child, with lightsome steps doth glide"
1683,_PART IV._,"By Father Time, and, looking in his face,"
1684,_PART IV._,"Cries, snatching blossoms from the fair road-side,"
1685,_PART IV._,"""I could pluck more, but for thy hurried pace."""
1686,_PART IV._,"The while her elder brother Pain, man grown,"
1687,_PART IV._,"Whose feet are hurt by many a thorn and stone,"
1688,_PART IV._,"Looks to some distant hill-top, high and calm,"
1689,_PART IV._,"Where he shall find not only rest, but balm"
1690,_PART IV._,"For all his wounds, and cries in tones of woe,"
1691,_PART IV._,"""O Father Time! why is thy pace so slow?"""
1692,_PART IV._,
1693,_PART IV._,"Two days, all sad with lonely wind and rain,"
1694,_PART IV._,"Went sobbing by, repeating o'er and o'er"
1695,_PART IV._,"The miserere, desolate and drear,"
1696,_PART IV._,Which every human heart must sometime hear.
1697,_PART IV._,"Pain is but little varied. Its refrain,"
1698,_PART IV._,"Whate'er the words are, is for aye the same."
1699,_PART IV._,The third day brought a change: for with it came
1700,_PART IV._,"Not only sunny smiles to Nature's face,"
1701,_PART IV._,"But Roy, our Roy came back to us. Once more"
1702,_PART IV._,"We looked into his laughing, handsome eyes,"
1703,_PART IV._,"Which, while they gave Aunt Ruth a glad surprise"
1704,_PART IV._,In no way puzzled her: for one glance told
1705,_PART IV._,"What each succeeding one confirmed, that he"
1706,_PART IV._,Who bent above her with the lissome grace
1707,_PART IV._,"Of his fine form, though grown so tall, could be"
1708,_PART IV._,No other than the Roy Montaine of old.
1709,_PART IV._,
1710,_PART IV._,It was a sweet reunion: and he brought
1711,_PART IV._,"So much of sunshine with him, that I caught,"
1712,_PART IV._,"Just from his smile alone, enough of gladness"
1713,_PART IV._,To make my heart forget a time its sadness.
1714,_PART IV._,We talked together of the dear old days:
1715,_PART IV._,"Leaving the present, with its depths and heights"
1716,_PART IV._,"Of life's maturer sorrows and delights,"
1717,_PART IV._,"I turned back to my childhood's level land,"
1718,_PART IV._,"And Roy and I, dear playmates, hand in hand,"
1719,_PART IV._,"Wandered in mem'ry, through the olden ways."
1720,_PART IV._,
1721,_PART IV._,It was the second evening of his coming.
1722,_PART IV._,"Helen was playing dreamily, and humming"
1723,_PART IV._,"Some wordless melody of white-souled thought,"
1724,_PART IV._,"While Roy and I sat by the open door,"
1725,_PART IV._,Re-living childish incidents of yore.
1726,_PART IV._,"My eyes were glowing, and my cheeks were hot"
1727,_PART IV._,"With warm young blood; excitement, joy, or pain"
1728,_PART IV._,Alike would send swift coursing through each vein.
1729,_PART IV._,"Roy, always eloquent, was waxing fine,"
1730,_PART IV._,And bringing vividly before my gaze
1731,_PART IV._,"Some old adventure of those halcyon days,"
1732,_PART IV._,"When suddenly in pauses of the talk,"
1733,_PART IV._,"I heard a well-known step upon the walk,"
1734,_PART IV._,And looked up quickly to meet full in mine
1735,_PART IV._,The eyes of Vivian Dangerfield. A flash
1736,_PART IV._,Shot from their depths:--a sudden blaze of light
1737,_PART IV._,"Like that swift followed by the thunder's crash,"
1738,_PART IV._,"Which said, ""Suspicion is confirmed by sight,"""
1739,_PART IV._,As they fell on the pleasant door-way scene.
1740,_PART IV._,"Then o'er his clear-cut face, a cold white look"
1741,_PART IV._,"Crept, like the pallid moonlight o'er a brook,"
1742,_PART IV._,"And, with a slight, proud bending of the head,"
1743,_PART IV._,"He stepped toward us haughtily and said,"
1744,_PART IV._,"""Please pardon my intrusion, Miss Maurine:"
1745,_PART IV._,I called to ask Miss Trevor for a book
1746,_PART IV._,"She spoke of lending me: nay, sit you still!"
1747,_PART IV._,"And I, by grant of your permission, will"
1748,_PART IV._,"Pass by to where I hear her playing."""
1749,_PART IV._,"""Stay!"""
1750,_PART IV._,"I said, ""one moment, Vivian, if you please;"""
1751,_PART IV._,"And suddenly bereft of all my ease,"
1752,_PART IV._,"And scarcely knowing what to do, or say,"
1753,_PART IV._,"Confused as any school-girl, I arose,"
1754,_PART IV._,And some way made each to the other known
1755,_PART IV._,"They bowed, shook hands: then Vivian turned away"
1756,_PART IV._,"And sought out Helen, leaving us alone."
1757,_PART IV._,
1758,_PART IV._,"""One of Miss Trevor's, or of Maurine's beaux?"
1759,_PART IV._,"Which may he be, who cometh like a prince"
1760,_PART IV._,"With haughty bearing, and an eagle eye?"""
1761,_PART IV._,"Roy queried, laughing: and I answered, ""Since"
1762,_PART IV._,"You saw him pass me for Miss Trevor's side,"
1763,_PART IV._,"I leave your own good judgment to reply."""
1764,_PART IV._,
1765,_PART IV._,And straightway caused the tide of talk to glide
1766,_PART IV._,"In other channels, striving to dispel"
1767,_PART IV._,The sudden gloom that o'er my spirit fell.
1768,_PART IV._,
1769,_PART IV._,We mortals are such hypocrites at best!
1770,_PART IV._,"When Conscience tries our courage with a test,"
1771,_PART IV._,"And points to some steep pathway, we set out"
1772,_PART IV._,"Boldly, denying any fear or doubt;"
1773,_PART IV._,"But pause before the first rock in the way,"
1774,_PART IV._,"And, looking back, with tears, at Conscience, say"
1775,_PART IV._,"""We are so sad, dear Conscience! for we would"
1776,_PART IV._,Most gladly do what to thee seemeth good;
1777,_PART IV._,"But lo! this rock! we cannot climb it, so"
1778,_PART IV._,"Thou must point out some other way to go."""
1779,_PART IV._,"Yet secretly we are rejoicing: and,"
1780,_PART IV._,"When right before our faces, as we stand"
1781,_PART IV._,"In seeming grief, the rock is cleft in twain,"
1782,_PART IV._,"Leaving the pathway clear, we shrink in pain!"
1783,_PART IV._,"And loth to go, by every act reveal"
1784,_PART IV._,What we so tried from Conscience to conceal.
1785,_PART IV._,
1786,_PART IV._,"I saw that hour, the way made plain, to do"
1787,_PART IV._,"With scarce an effort, what had seemed a strife"
1788,_PART IV._,That would require the strength of my whole life.
1789,_PART IV._,
1790,_PART IV._,Women have quick perceptions: and I knew
1791,_PART IV._,"That Vivian's heart was full of jealous pain,"
1792,_PART IV._,Suspecting--nay _believing_ Roy Montaine
1793,_PART IV._,To be my lover.--First my altered mien--
1794,_PART IV._,And next the letter--then the door-way scene--
1795,_PART IV._,My flushed face gazing in the one above
1796,_PART IV._,"That bent so near me, and my strange confusion"
1797,_PART IV._,"When Vivian came, all led to one conclusion:"
1798,_PART IV._,"That I had but been playing with his love,"
1799,_PART IV._,As women sometimes cruelly do play
1800,_PART IV._,With hearts when their true lovers are away.
1801,_PART IV._,
1802,_PART IV._,"There could be nothing easier, than just"
1803,_PART IV._,To let him linger on in this belief
1804,_PART IV._,Till hourly-fed Suspicion and Distrust
1805,_PART IV._,Should turn to scorn and anger all his grief.
1806,_PART IV._,"Compared with me, so doubly sweet and pure"
1807,_PART IV._,"Would Helen seem, my purpose would be sure,"
1808,_PART IV._,And certain of completion in the end.
1809,_PART IV._,"But now, the way was made so straight and clear,"
1810,_PART IV._,"My coward heart shrank back in guilty fear,"
1811,_PART IV._,"Till Conscience whispered with her ""still small voice,"""
1812,_PART IV._,"""The precious time is passing--make thy choice--"
1813,_PART IV._,"Resign thy love, or slay thy trusting friend."""
1814,_PART IV._,
1815,_PART IV._,"The growing moon, watched by the myriad eyes"
1816,_PART IV._,"Of countless stars, went sailing through the skies,"
1817,_PART IV._,"Like some young prince, rising to rule a nation,"
1818,_PART IV._,To whom all eyes are turned in expectation.
1819,_PART IV._,A woman who possesses tact and art
1820,_PART IV._,"And strength of will can take the hand of doom,"
1821,_PART IV._,"And walk on, smiling sweetly as she goes,"
1822,_PART IV._,"With rosy lips, and rounded cheeks of bloom,"
1823,_PART IV._,Cheating a loud-tongued world that never knows
1824,_PART IV._,The pain and sorrow of her hidden heart.
1825,_PART IV._,And so I joined in Roy's bright changing chat;
1826,_PART IV._,"Answered his sallies--talked of this and that,"
1827,_PART IV._,My brow unruffled as the calm still wave
1828,_PART IV._,"That tells not of the wrecked ship, and the grave"
1829,_PART IV._,Beneath its surface.
1830,_PART IV._,"Then we heard, ere long,"
1831,_PART IV._,"The sound of Helen's gentle voice in song,"
1832,_PART IV._,"And, rising, entered where the subtle power"
1833,_PART IV._,"Of Vivian's eyes, forgiving while accusing,"
1834,_PART IV._,"Finding me weak, had won me, in that hour;"
1835,_PART IV._,"But Roy, alway polite and debonair"
1836,_PART IV._,"Where ladies were, now hung about my chair"
1837,_PART IV._,"With nameless delicate attentions, using"
1838,_PART IV._,"That air devotional, and those small arts"
1839,_PART IV._,Acquaintance with society imparts
1840,_PART IV._,To men gallant by nature.
1841,_PART IV._,'T was my sex
1842,_PART IV._,And not myself he bowed to. Had my place
1843,_PART IV._,"Been filled that evening by a dowager,"
1844,_PART IV._,"Twice his own age, he would have given her"
1845,_PART IV._,The same attentions. But they served to vex
1846,_PART IV._,Whatever hope in Vivian's heart remained.
1847,_PART IV._,"The cold, white look crept back upon his face,"
1848,_PART IV._,Which told how deeply he was hurt and pained.
1849,_PART IV._,
1850,_PART IV._,"Little by little all things had conspired,"
1851,_PART IV._,"To bring events I dreaded, yet desired."
1852,_PART IV._,"We were in constant intercourse: walks, rides,"
1853,_PART IV._,"Picnics and sails, filled weeks of golden weather,"
1854,_PART IV._,And almost hourly we were thrown together.
1855,_PART IV._,No words were spoken of rebuke or scorn:
1856,_PART IV._,Good friends we seemed. But as a gulf divides
1857,_PART IV._,"This land and that, though lying side by side,"
1858,_PART IV._,So rolled a gulf between us--deep and wide--
1859,_PART IV._,"The gulf of doubt, which widened slowly morn"
1860,_PART IV._,And noon and night.
1861,_PART IV._,Free and informal were
1862,_PART IV._,"These picnics and excursions. Yet, although"
1863,_PART IV._,Helen and I would sometimes choose to go
1864,_PART IV._,"Without our escorts, leaving them quite free."
1865,_PART IV._,It happened alway Roy would seek out me
1866,_PART IV._,"Ere passed the day, while Vivian walked with her."
1867,_PART IV._,I had no thought of flirting. Roy was just
1868,_PART IV._,"Like some dear brother, and I quite forgot"
1869,_PART IV._,The kinship was so distant it was not
1870,_PART IV._,"Safe to rely upon in perfect trust,"
1871,_PART IV._,Without reserve or caution. Many a time
1872,_PART IV._,"When there was some steep mountain side to climb,"
1873,_PART IV._,"And I grew weary, he would say, ""Maurine,"
1874,_PART IV._,"Come rest you here."" And I would go and lean"
1875,_PART IV._,"My head upon his shoulder, or would stand"
1876,_PART IV._,And let him hold in his my willing hand.
1877,_PART IV._,The while he stroked it gently with his own.
1878,_PART IV._,"Or I would let him clasp me with his arm,"
1879,_PART IV._,"Nor entertained a thought of any harm,"
1880,_PART IV._,Nor once supposed but Vivian was alone
1881,_PART IV._,In his suspicions. But ere long the truth
1882,_PART IV._,I learned in consternation! both Aunt Ruth
1883,_PART IV._,"And Helen, honestly, in faith believed"
1884,_PART IV._,That Roy and I were lovers.
1885,_PART IV._,"Undeceived,"
1886,_PART IV._,Some careless words might open Vivian's eyes
1887,_PART IV._,"And spoil my plans. So reasoning in this wise,"
1888,_PART IV._,"To all their sallies I in jest replied,"
1889,_PART IV._,"To naught assented, and yet naught denied,"
1890,_PART IV._,"With Roy unchanged remaining, confident"
1891,_PART IV._,Each understood just what the other meant.
1892,_PART IV._,
1893,_PART IV._,"If I grew weary of this double part,"
1894,_PART IV._,And self-imposed deception caused my heart
1895,_PART IV._,"Sometimes to shrink, I needed but to gaze"
1896,_PART IV._,"On Helen's face: that wore a look ethereal,"
1897,_PART IV._,As if she dwelt above the things material
1898,_PART IV._,And held communion with the angels. So
1899,_PART IV._,I fed my strength and courage through the days.
1900,_PART IV._,What time the harvest moon rose full and clear
1901,_PART IV._,"And cast its ling'ring radiance on the earth,"
1902,_PART IV._,"We made a feast; and called from far and near,"
1903,_PART IV._,"Our friends, who came to share the scene of mirth."
1904,_PART IV._,Fair forms and faces flitted to and fro;
1905,_PART IV._,"But none more sweet than Helen's. Robed in white,"
1906,_PART IV._,She floated like a vision through the dance.
1907,_PART IV._,"So frailly fragile and so phantom fair,"
1908,_PART IV._,"She seemed like some stray spirit of the air,"
1909,_PART IV._,And was pursued by many an anxious glance
1910,_PART IV._,That looked to see her fading from the sight
1911,_PART IV._,Like figures that a dreamer sees at night.
1912,_PART IV._,
1913,_PART IV._,And noble men and gallants graced the scene:
1914,_PART IV._,Yet none more noble or more grand of mien
1915,_PART IV._,"Than Vivian--broad of chest and shoulder, tall"
1916,_PART IV._,"And finely formed, as any Grecian god"
1917,_PART IV._,Whose high-arched foot on Mount Olympus trod.
1918,_PART IV._,"His clear-cut face was beardless; and, like those"
1919,_PART IV._,"Same Grecian statues, when in calm repose,"
1920,_PART IV._,Was it in hue and feature. Framed in hair
1921,_PART IV._,Dark and abundant; lighted by large eyes
1922,_PART IV._,"That could be cold as steel in winter air,"
1923,_PART IV._,Or warm and sunny as Italian skies.
1924,_PART IV._,
1925,_PART IV._,"Weary of mirth and music, and the sound"
1926,_PART IV._,"Of tripping feet, I sought a moment's rest"
1927,_PART IV._,"Within the lib'ry, where a group I found"
1928,_PART IV._,"Of guests, discussing with apparent zest"
1929,_PART IV._,"Some theme of interest--Vivian, near the while,"
1930,_PART IV._,Leaning and listening with his slow odd smile.
1931,_PART IV._,"""Now Miss La Pelle, we will appeal to you,"""
1932,_PART IV._,"Cried young Guy Semple, as I entered. ""We"
1933,_PART IV._,"Have been discussing right before his face,"
1934,_PART IV._,"All unrebuked by him, as you may see,"
1935,_PART IV._,A poem lately published by our friend:
1936,_PART IV._,And we are quite divided. I contend
1937,_PART IV._,The poem is a libel and untrue
1938,_PART IV._,"I hold the fickle women are but few,"
1939,_PART IV._,Compared with those who are like yon fair moon
1940,_PART IV._,"That, ever faithful, rises in her place"
1941,_PART IV._,"Whether she's greeted by the flowers of June,"
1942,_PART IV._,"Or cold and dreary stretches of white space."""
1943,_PART IV._,
1944,_PART IV._,"""Oh!"" cried another, ""Mr. Dangerfield,"
1945,_PART IV._,Look to your laurels! or you needs must yield
1946,_PART IV._,"The crown to Semple, who, 'tis very plain,"
1947,_PART IV._,"Has mounted Pegasus and grasped his mane."""
1948,_PART IV._,
1949,_PART IV._,"All laughed: and then, as Guy appealed to me"
1950,_PART IV._,"I answered lightly, ""My young friend, I fear"
1951,_PART IV._,You chose a most unlucky simile
1952,_PART IV._,To prove the truth of woman. To her place
1953,_PART IV._,The moon does rise--but with a different face
1954,_PART IV._,Each time she comes. But now I needs must hear
1955,_PART IV._,"The poem read, before I can consent"
1956,_PART IV._,"To pass my judgment on the sentiment."""
1957,_PART IV._,
1958,_PART IV._,All clamored that the author was the man
1959,_PART IV._,"To read the poem: and, with tones that said"
1960,_PART IV._,"More than the cutting, scornful words he read,"
1961,_PART IV._,"Taking the book Guy gave him, he began:"

1964,HER LOVE.,
1965,HER LOVE.,The sands upon the ocean side

1968,HER LOVE.,A woman's love I liken to.
1969,HER LOVE.,
1970,HER LOVE.,"The summer zephyrs, light and vain,"
1971,HER LOVE.,That sing the same alluring strain
1972,HER LOVE.,To every grass blade on the plain--
1973,HER LOVE.,A woman's love is nothing more.
1974,HER LOVE.,
1975,HER LOVE.,The sunshine of an April day
1976,HER LOVE.,"That comes to warm you with its ray,"
1977,HER LOVE.,But while you smile has flown away--
1978,HER LOVE.,A woman's love is like to this.
1979,HER LOVE.,
1980,HER LOVE.,"God made poor woman with no heart,"
1981,HER LOVE.,"But gave her skill, and tact, and art,"
1982,HER LOVE.,"And so she lives, and plays her part."
1983,HER LOVE.,"We must not blame, but pity her."
1984,HER LOVE.,
1985,HER LOVE.,She leans to man--but just to hear
1986,HER LOVE.,"The praise he whispers in her ear,"
1987,HER LOVE.,"Herself, not him, she holdeth dear--"
1988,HER LOVE.,O fool! to be deceived by her.
1989,HER LOVE.,
1990,HER LOVE.,To sate her selfish thirst she quaffs
1991,HER LOVE.,The love of strong hearts in sweet draughts
1992,HER LOVE.,"Then throws them lightly by and laughs,"
1993,HER LOVE.,Too weak to understand their pain.
1994,HER LOVE.,
1995,HER LOVE.,As changeful as the winds that blow
1996,HER LOVE.,"From every region, to and fro,"
1997,HER LOVE.,"Devoid of heart, she cannot know"
1998,HER LOVE.,The suffering of a human heart.
1999,HER LOVE.,
2000,HER LOVE.,"I knew the cold, fixed gaze of Vivian's eyes"
2001,HER LOVE.,Saw the slow color to my forehead rise;
2002,HER LOVE.,"But lightly answered, toying with my fan,"
2003,HER LOVE.,"""That sentiment is very like a man!"
2004,HER LOVE.,"Men call us fickle, but they do us wrong;"
2005,HER LOVE.,"We're only frail and helpless, men are strong;"
2006,HER LOVE.,"And when love dies, they take the poor dead thing"
2007,HER LOVE.,"And make a shroud out of their suffering,"
2008,HER LOVE.,And drag the corpse about with them for years.
2009,HER LOVE.,But we?--we mourn it for a day with tears!
2010,HER LOVE.,"And then we robe it for its last long rest,"
2011,HER LOVE.,"And being women, feeble things at best,"
2012,HER LOVE.,We cannot dig the grave ourselves. And so
2013,HER LOVE.,We call strong-limbed New Love to lay it low:
2014,HER LOVE.,Immortal sexton he! whom Venus sends
2015,HER LOVE.,"To do this service for her earthly friends,"
2016,HER LOVE.,The trusty fellow digs the grave so deep
2017,HER LOVE.,"Nothing disturbs the dead laid there to sleep."""
2018,HER LOVE.,
2019,HER LOVE.,The laugh that followed had not died away
2020,HER LOVE.,"Ere Roy Montaine came seeking me, to say"
2021,HER LOVE.,"The band was tuning for our waltz, and so"
2022,HER LOVE.,Back to the ball-room bore me. In the glow
2023,HER LOVE.,"And heat and whirl, my strength ere long was spent,"
2024,HER LOVE.,"And I grew faint and dizzy, and we went"
2025,HER LOVE.,"Out on the cool moonlighted portico,"
2026,HER LOVE.,"And, sitting there, Roy drew my languid head"
2027,HER LOVE.,"Upon the shelter of his breast, and bent"
2028,HER LOVE.,"His smiling eyes upon me, as he said,"
2029,HER LOVE.,"""I'll try the mesmerism of my touch"
2030,HER LOVE.,"To work a cure: be very quiet now,"
2031,HER LOVE.,And let me make some passes o'er your brow.
2032,HER LOVE.,"Why, how it throbs! you've exercised too much!"
2033,HER LOVE.,"I shall not let you dance again to-night."""
2034,HER LOVE.,
2035,HER LOVE.,"Just then before us, in the broad moonlight,"
2036,HER LOVE.,Two forms were mirrored: and I turned my face
2037,HER LOVE.,To catch the teasing and mischievous glance
2038,HER LOVE.,"Of Helen's eyes, as, heated by the dance,"
2039,HER LOVE.,"Leaning on Vivian's arm, she sought this place."
2040,HER LOVE.,
2041,HER LOVE.,"""I beg your pardon,"" came in that round tone"
2042,HER LOVE.,"Of his low voice. ""I think we do intrude."""
2043,HER LOVE.,"Bowing, they turned, and left us quite alone"
2044,HER LOVE.,"Ere I could speak, or change my attitude."
2045,HER LOVE.,
2046,HER LOVE.,
2047,_PART V._,_PART V._
2048,_PART V._,
2049,_PART V._,A visit to a cave some miles away
2050,_PART V._,"Was next in order. So, one sunny day,"
2051,_PART V._,Four prancing steeds conveyed a laughing load
2052,_PART V._,Of merry pleasure-seekers o'er the road.
2053,_PART V._,"A basket picnic, music and croquet"
2054,_PART V._,"Were in the programme. Skies were blue and clear,"
2055,_PART V._,And cool winds whispered of the Autumn near.
2056,_PART V._,The merry-makers filled the time with pleasure:
2057,_PART V._,"Some floated to the music's rhythmic measure,"
2058,_PART V._,"Some played, some promenaded on the green."
2059,_PART V._,
2060,_PART V._,"Ticked off by happy hearts, the moments passed."
2061,_PART V._,"The afternoon, all glow and glimmer, came."
2062,_PART V._,"Helen and Roy were leaders of some game,"
2063,_PART V._,And Vivian was not visible.
2064,_PART V._,"""Maurine,"
2065,_PART V._,I challenge you to climb yon cliff with me!
2066,_PART V._,"And who shall tire, or reach the summit last"
2067,_PART V._,"Must pay a forfeit,"" cried a romping maid."
2068,_PART V._,"""Come! start at once, or own you are afraid."""
2069,_PART V._,"So challenged I made ready for the race,"
2070,_PART V._,Deciding first the forfeit was to be
2071,_PART V._,A handsome pair of bootees to replace
2072,_PART V._,The victor's loss who made the rough ascent.
2073,_PART V._,The cliff was steep and stony. On we went
2074,_PART V._,"As eagerly as if the path was Fame,"
2075,_PART V._,"And what we climbed for, glory and a name."
2076,_PART V._,"My hands were bruised; my garments sadly rent,"
2077,_PART V._,"But on I clambered. Soon I heard a cry,"
2078,_PART V._,"""Maurine! Maurine! my strength is wholly spent!"
2079,_PART V._,"You've won the boots! I'm going back--good bye!"""
2080,_PART V._,"And back she turned, in spite of laugh and jeer."
2081,_PART V._,
2082,_PART V._,"I reached the summit: and its solitude,"
2083,_PART V._,"Wherein no living creature did intrude,"
2084,_PART V._,"Save some sad birds that wheeled and circled near,"
2085,_PART V._,I found far sweeter than the scene below.
2086,_PART V._,"Alone with One who knew my hidden woe,"
2087,_PART V._,I did not feel so much alone as when
2088,_PART V._,I mixed with th' unthinking throngs of men.
2089,_PART V._,
2090,_PART V._,"Some flowers that decked the barren, sterile place"
2091,_PART V._,"I plucked, and read the lesson they conveyed,"
2092,_PART V._,"That in our lives, albeit dark with shade"
2093,_PART V._,"And rough and hard with labor, yet may grow"
2094,_PART V._,"The flowers of Patience, Sympathy, and Grace."
2095,_PART V._,
2096,_PART V._,"As I walked on in meditative thought,"
2097,_PART V._,A serpent writhed across my pathway; not
2098,_PART V._,A large or deadly serpent; yet the sight
2099,_PART V._,Filled me with ghastly terror and affright.
2100,_PART V._,I shrieked aloud: a darkness veiled my eyes--
2101,_PART V._,And I fell fainting 'neath the watchful skies.
2102,_PART V._,
2103,_PART V._,"I was no coward. Country-bred and born,"
2104,_PART V._,I had no feeling but the keenest scorn
2105,_PART V._,"For those fine lady ""ah's"" and ""oh's"" of fear"
2106,_PART V._,So much assumed (when any man is near).
2107,_PART V._,But God implanted in each human heart
2108,_PART V._,"A natural horror, and a sickly dread"
2109,_PART V._,"Of that accursèd, slimy, creeping thing"
2110,_PART V._,That squirms a limbless carcass o'er the ground.
2111,_PART V._,And where that inborn loathing is not found
2112,_PART V._,You'll find the serpent qualities instead.
2113,_PART V._,"Who fears it not, himself is next of kin,"
2114,_PART V._,And in his bosom holds some treacherous art
2115,_PART V._,Whereby to counteract its venomed sting.
2116,_PART V._,And all are sired by Satan--Chief of Sin.
2117,_PART V._,
2118,_PART V._,"Who loathes not that foul creature of the dust,"
2119,_PART V._,"However fair in seeming, I distrust."
2120,_PART V._,
2121,_PART V._,"I woke from my unconsciousness, to know"
2122,_PART V._,"I leaned upon a broad and manly breast,"
2123,_PART V._,"And Vivian's voice was speaking, soft and low,"
2124,_PART V._,"Sweet whispered words of passion, o'er and o'er."
2125,_PART V._,I dared not breathe. Had I found Eden's shore?
2126,_PART V._,Was this a foretaste of eternal bliss?
2127,_PART V._,"""My love,"" he sighed, his voice like winds that moan"
2128,_PART V._,"Before a rain in Summer time, ""My own,"
2129,_PART V._,"For one sweet stolen moment, lie and rest"
2130,_PART V._,Upon this heart that loves and hates you both!
2131,_PART V._,O fair false face! Why were you made so fair!
2132,_PART V._,O mouth of Southern sweetness! that ripe kiss
2133,_PART V._,"That hangs upon you, I do take an oath"
2134,_PART V._,_His_ lips shall never gather. There!--and there!
2135,_PART V._,I steal it from him. Are you his--all his?
2136,_PART V._,"Nay you are mine, this moment, as I dreamed--"
2137,_PART V._,Blind fool--believing you were what you seemed--
2138,_PART V._,You would be mine in all the years to come.
2139,_PART V._,Fair fiend! I love and hate you in a breath.
2140,_PART V._,"O God! if this white pallor were but _death_,"
2141,_PART V._,"And I were stretched beside you, cold and dumb,"
2142,_PART V._,"My arms about you, so--in fond embrace!"
2143,_PART V._,"My lips pressed, so--upon your dying face!"""
2144,_PART V._,
2145,_PART V._,"""Woman, how dare you bring me to such shame!"
2146,_PART V._,"How dare you drive me to an act like this,"
2147,_PART V._,To steal from your unconscious lips the kiss
2148,_PART V._,You lured me on to think my rightful claim!
2149,_PART V._,O frail and puny woman! could you know
2150,_PART V._,The devil that you waken in the hearts
2151,_PART V._,"You snare and bind in your enticing arts,"
2152,_PART V._,"The thin, pale stuff that in your veins doth flow"
2153,_PART V._,Would freeze in terror.
2154,_PART V._,Strange you have such power
2155,_PART V._,"To please, or pain us, poor, weak, soulless things--"
2156,_PART V._,Devoid of passion as a senseless flower!
2157,_PART V._,"Like butterflies, your only boast, your wings."
2158,_PART V._,"There, now, I scorn you--scorn you from this hour,"
2159,_PART V._,"And hate myself for having talked of love!"""
2160,_PART V._,
2161,_PART V._,He pushed me from him. And I felt as those
2162,_PART V._,"Doomed angels must, when pearly gates above"
2163,_PART V._,Are closed against them.
2164,_PART V._,With a feigned surprise
2165,_PART V._,"I started up and opened wide my eyes,"
2166,_PART V._,And looked about. Then in confusion rose
2167,_PART V._,And stood before him.
2168,_PART V._,
2169,_PART V._,"""Pardon me, I pray!"""
2170,_PART V._,"He said quite coldly. ""Half an hour ago"
2171,_PART V._,"I left you with the company below,"
2172,_PART V._,"And sought this cliff. A moment since you cried,"
2173,_PART V._,"It seemed, in sudden terror and alarm."
2174,_PART V._,I came in time to see you swoon away.
2175,_PART V._,You'll need assistance down the rugged side
2176,_PART V._,"Of this steep cliff. I pray you take my arm."""
2177,_PART V._,
2178,_PART V._,"So, formal and constrained, we passed along,"
2179,_PART V._,"Rejoined our friends, and mingled with the throng"
2180,_PART V._,To have no further speech again that day.
2181,_PART V._,
2182,_PART V._,"Next morn there came a bulky document,"
2183,_PART V._,"The legal firm of Blank & Blank had sent,"
2184,_PART V._,Containing news unlooked for. An estate
2185,_PART V._,Which proved a cosy fortune--no-wise great
2186,_PART V._,"Or princely--had in France been left to me,"
2187,_PART V._,My grandsire's last descendant. And it brought
2188,_PART V._,A sense of joy and freedom in the thought
2189,_PART V._,"Of foreign travel, which I hoped would be"
2190,_PART V._,"A panacea for my troubled mind,"
2191,_PART V._,That longed to leave the olden scenes behind
2192,_PART V._,"With all their recollections, and to flee"
2193,_PART V._,To some strange country.
2194,_PART V._,I was in such haste
2195,_PART V._,To put between me and my native land
2196,_PART V._,"The briny ocean's desolating waste,"
2197,_PART V._,"I gave Aunt Ruth no peace, until she planned"
2198,_PART V._,"To sail that week, two months: though she was fain"
2199,_PART V._,To wait until the Springtime. Roy Montaine
2200,_PART V._,Would be our guide and escort.
2201,_PART V._,No one dreamed
2202,_PART V._,"The cause of my strange hurry, but all seemed"
2203,_PART V._,To think good fortune had quite turned my brain.
2204,_PART V._,"One bright October morning, when the woods"
2205,_PART V._,Had donned their purple mantles and red hoods
2206,_PART V._,"In honor of the Frost King, Vivian came,"
2207,_PART V._,"Bringing some green leaves, tipped with crimson flame,--"
2208,_PART V._,First trophies of the Autumn time.
2209,_PART V._,And Roy
2210,_PART V._,Made a proposal that we all should go
2211,_PART V._,And ramble in the forest for a while.
2212,_PART V._,But Helen said she was not well--and so
2213,_PART V._,"Must stay at home. Then Vivian, with a smile,"
2214,_PART V._,"Responded, ""I will stay and talk to you,"
2215,_PART V._,"And they may go;"" at which her two cheeks grew"
2216,_PART V._,"Like twin blush roses;--dyed with love's red wave,"
2217,_PART V._,Her fair face shone transfigured with great joy.
2218,_PART V._,
2219,_PART V._,And Vivian saw--and suddenly was grave.
2220,_PART V._,
2221,_PART V._,Roy took my arm in that protecting way
2222,_PART V._,"Peculiar to some men, which seems to say,"
2223,_PART V._,"""I shield my own,"" a manner pleasing, e'en"
2224,_PART V._,When we are conscious that it does not mean
2225,_PART V._,More than a simple courtesy. A woman
2226,_PART V._,"Whose heart is wholly feminine and human,"
2227,_PART V._,"And not unsexed by hobbies, likes to be"
2228,_PART V._,"The object of that tender chivalry,"
2229,_PART V._,"That guardianship which man bestows on her,"
2230,_PART V._,Yet mixed with deference; as if she were
2231,_PART V._,"Half child, half angel."
2232,_PART V._,"Though she may be strong,"
2233,_PART V._,"Noble and self-reliant, not afraid"
2234,_PART V._,To raise her hand and voice against all wrong
2235,_PART V._,"And all oppression, yet if she be made,"
2236,_PART V._,"With all the independence of her thought,"
2237,_PART V._,"A woman womanly, as God designed,"
2238,_PART V._,Albeit she may have as great a mind
2239,_PART V._,"As man, her brother, yet his strength of arm"
2240,_PART V._,"His muscle and his boldness she has not,"
2241,_PART V._,And cannot have without she loses what
2242,_PART V._,"Is far more precious, modesty and grace."
2243,_PART V._,"So, walking on in her appointed place,"
2244,_PART V._,"She does not strive to ape him, nor pretend"
2245,_PART V._,"But that she needs him for a guide and friend,"
2246,_PART V._,To shield her with his greater strength from harm.
2247,_PART V._,
2248,_PART V._,We reached the forest; wandered to and fro
2249,_PART V._,Through many a winding path and dim retreat.
2250,_PART V._,Till I grew weary: when I chose a seat
2251,_PART V._,"Upon an oak tree, which had been laid low"
2252,_PART V._,"By some wind storm, or by some lightning stroke."
2253,_PART V._,"And Roy stood just below me, where the ledge"
2254,_PART V._,On which I sat sloped steeply to the edge
2255,_PART V._,Of sunny meadows lying at my feet.
2256,_PART V._,One hand held mine; the other grasped a limb
2257,_PART V._,That cast its checkered shadows over him;
2258,_PART V._,"And, with his head thrown back, his dark eyes raised"
2259,_PART V._,"And fixed upon me, silently he gazed"
2260,_PART V._,"Until I, smiling, turned to him and spoke:"
2261,_PART V._,"""Give words, my cousin, to those thoughts that rise,"
2262,_PART V._,"And, like dumb spirits, look forth from your eyes."""
2263,_PART V._,
2264,_PART V._,The smooth and even darkness of his cheek
2265,_PART V._,Was stained one moment by a flush of red.
2266,_PART V._,He swayed his lithe form nearer as he stood
2267,_PART V._,Still clinging to the branch above his head.
2268,_PART V._,"His brilliant eyes grew darker; and he said,"
2269,_PART V._,"With sudden passion, ""Do you bid me speak?"
2270,_PART V._,"I can not, then, keep silence if I would."
2271,_PART V._,"That hateful fortune, coming as it did,"
2272,_PART V._,Forbade my speaking sooner; for I knew
2273,_PART V._,A harsh tongued world would quickly misconstrue
2274,_PART V._,"My motive for a meaner one. But, sweet,"
2275,_PART V._,So big my heart has grown with love for you
2276,_PART V._,"I can not shelter it, or keep it hid."
2277,_PART V._,"And so I cast it throbbing at your feet,"
2278,_PART V._,"For you to guard and cherish, or to break."
2279,_PART V._,"Maurine, I love you better than my life."
2280,_PART V._,"My friend--my cousin--be still more, my wife!"
2281,_PART V._,"Maurine, Maurine, what answer do you make?"""
2282,_PART V._,
2283,_PART V._,I scarce could breathe for wonderment; and numb
2284,_PART V._,"With truth that fell too suddenly, sat dumb"
2285,_PART V._,"With sheer amaze, and stared at Roy with eyes"
2286,_PART V._,That looked no feeling but complete surprise.
2287,_PART V._,He swayed so near his breath was on my cheek.
2288,_PART V._,"""Maurine, Maurine,"" he whispered, ""will you speak?"""
2289,_PART V._,
2290,_PART V._,"Then suddenly, as o'er some magic glass"
2291,_PART V._,"One picture in a score of shapes will pass,"
2292,_PART V._,I seemed to see Roy glide before my gaze.
2293,_PART V._,"First, as the playmate of my earlier days--"
2294,_PART V._,"Next, as my kin--and then my valued friend,"
2295,_PART V._,"And last, my lover. As when colors blend"
2296,_PART V._,"In some unlooked-for group before our eyes,"
2297,_PART V._,"We hold the glass, and look them o'er and o'er"
2298,_PART V._,"So now I gazed on Roy in his new guise,"
2299,_PART V._,In which he ne'er appeared to me before.
2300,_PART V._,
2301,_PART V._,"His form was like a panther's in its grace,"
2302,_PART V._,"So lithe and supple, and of medium height,"
2303,_PART V._,And garbed in all the elegance of fashion.
2304,_PART V._,"His large black eyes were full of fire and passion,"
2305,_PART V._,"And in expression fearless, firm, and bright."
2306,_PART V._,"His hair was like the very deeps of night,"
2307,_PART V._,And hung in raven clusters 'round a face
2308,_PART V._,Of dark and flashing beauty.
2309,_PART V._,He was more
2310,_PART V._,Like some romantic maiden's grand ideal
2311,_PART V._,Than like a common being. As I gazed
2312,_PART V._,"Upon the handsome face to mine upraised,"
2313,_PART V._,"I saw before me, living, breathing, real,"
2314,_PART V._,The hero of my early day-dreams: though
2315,_PART V._,"So full my heart was with that clear-cut face,"
2316,_PART V._,"Which, all unlike, yet claimed the hero's place,"
2317,_PART V._,"I had not recognized him so before,"
2318,_PART V._,"Or thought of him, save as a valued friend."
2319,_PART V._,"So now I called him, adding,"
2320,_PART V._,"""Foolish boy!"
2321,_PART V._,Each word of love you utter aims a blow
2322,_PART V._,At that sweet trust I had reposed in you.
2323,_PART V._,"I was so certain I had found a true,"
2324,_PART V._,"Steadfast man friend, on whom I could depend,"
2325,_PART V._,"And go on wholly trusting, to the end."
2326,_PART V._,"Why did you shatter my delusion, Roy,"
2327,_PART V._,"By turning to a lover?"""
2328,_PART V._,"""Why, indeed!"
2329,_PART V._,"Because I loved you more than any brother,"
2330,_PART V._,"Or any friend could love."" Then he began"
2331,_PART V._,"To argue like a lawyer, and to plead"
2332,_PART V._,"With all his eloquence. And, listening,"
2333,_PART V._,I strove to think it was a goodly thing
2334,_PART V._,"To be so fondly loved by such a man,"
2335,_PART V._,"And it were best to give his wooing heed,"
2336,_PART V._,And not deny him. Then before my eyes
2337,_PART V._,"In all its clear-cut majesty, that other"
2338,_PART V._,Haughty and poet-handsome face would rise
2339,_PART V._,And rob my purpose of all life and strength.
2340,_PART V._,
2341,_PART V._,"Roy urged and argued, as Roy only could,"
2342,_PART V._,"With that impetuous, boyish eloquence."
2343,_PART V._,"He held my hands, and vowed I must, and should"
2344,_PART V._,"Give some least hope; till, in my own defense,"
2345,_PART V._,"I turned upon him, and replied at length:"
2346,_PART V._,"""I thank you for the noble heart you offer:"
2347,_PART V._,But it deserves a true one in exchange.
2348,_PART V._,I could love you if I loved not another
2349,_PART V._,"Who keeps my heart; so I have none to proffer."""
2350,_PART V._,
2351,_PART V._,"Then, seeing how his dark eyes flashed, I said,"
2352,_PART V._,"""Dear Roy! I know my words seem very strange;"
2353,_PART V._,But I love one I cannot hope to wed.
2354,_PART V._,"A river rolls between us, dark and deep."
2355,_PART V._,To cross it--were to stain with blood my hand.
2356,_PART V._,You force my speech on what I fain would keep
2357,_PART V._,"In my own bosom, but you understand?"
2358,_PART V._,"My heart is given to love that's sanctified,"
2359,_PART V._,And now can feel no other.
2360,_PART V._,
2361,_PART V._,Be you kind
2362,_PART V._,"Dear Roy, my brother! speak of this no more,"
2363,_PART V._,Lest pleading and denying should divide
2364,_PART V._,The hearts so long united. Let me find
2365,_PART V._,In you my cousin and my friend of yore
2366,_PART V._,"And now come home. The morning, all too soon"
2367,_PART V._,"And unperceived, has melted into noon."
2368,_PART V._,"Helen will miss us, and we must return."""
2369,_PART V._,
2370,_PART V._,"He took my hand, and helped me to arise,"
2371,_PART V._,Smiling upon me with his sad dark eyes.
2372,_PART V._,"Where passion's fires had, sudden, ceased to burn."
2373,_PART V._,
2374,_PART V._,"""And so,"" he said, ""too soon and unforeseen"
2375,_PART V._,"My friendship melted into love, Maurine."
2376,_PART V._,"But, sweet! I am not wholly in the blame,"
2377,_PART V._,"For what you term my folly. You forgot,"
2378,_PART V._,"So long we'd known each other, I had not"
2379,_PART V._,In truth a brother's or a cousin's claim.
2380,_PART V._,"But I remembered, when through every nerve"
2381,_PART V._,Your lightest touch went thrilling; and began
2382,_PART V._,To love you with that human love of man
2383,_PART V._,"For comely woman. By your coaxing arts,"
2384,_PART V._,"You won your way into my heart of hearts,"
2385,_PART V._,And all Platonic feelings put to rout.
2386,_PART V._,A maid should never lay aside reserve
2387,_PART V._,"With one who's not her kinsman, out and out."
2388,_PART V._,"But as we now, with measured steps, retrace"
2389,_PART V._,"The path we came, e'en so my heart I'll send,"
2390,_PART V._,"At your command, back to the olden place,"
2391,_PART V._,"And strive to love you only as a friend."""
2392,_PART V._,"I felt the justice of his mild reproof,"
2393,_PART V._,"But answered laughing, ""'Tis the same old cry:"
2394,_PART V._,"'The woman tempted me, and I did eat.'"
2395,_PART V._,Since Adam's time we've heard it. But I'll try
2396,_PART V._,"And be more prudent, sir, and hold aloof"
2397,_PART V._,The fruit I never once had thought so sweet
2398,_PART V._,"'Twould tempt you any. Now go dress for dinner,"
2399,_PART V._,Thou sinned against! as also will the sinner.
2400,_PART V._,"And guard each act, that no least look betray"
2401,_PART V._,"What's passed between us."""
2402,_PART V._,Then I turned away
2403,_PART V._,"And sought my room, low humming some old air"
2404,_PART V._,That ceased upon the threshold; for mine eyes
2405,_PART V._,Fell on a face so glorified and fair
2406,_PART V._,"All other senses, merged in that of sight,"
2407,_PART V._,Were lost in contemplation of the bright
2408,_PART V._,"And wond'rous picture, which had otherwise"
2409,_PART V._,Made dim my vision.
2410,_PART V._,"Waiting in my room,"
2411,_PART V._,Her whole face lit as by an inward flame
2412,_PART V._,"That shed its halo 'round her, Helen stood;"
2413,_PART V._,Her fair hands folded like a lily's leaves
2414,_PART V._,Weighed down by happy dews of summer eves.
2415,_PART V._,Upon her cheek the color went and came
2416,_PART V._,As sunlight flickers o'er a bed of bloom;
2417,_PART V._,"And, like some slim young sapling of the wood,"
2418,_PART V._,Her slender form leaned slightly; and her hair
2419,_PART V._,"Fell 'round her loosely, in long curling strands"
2420,_PART V._,"All unconfined, and as by loving hands"
2421,_PART V._,Tossed into bright confusion.
2422,_PART V._,"Standing there,"
2423,_PART V._,"Her starry eyes uplifted, she did seem"
2424,_PART V._,Like some unearthly creature of a dream;
2425,_PART V._,"Until she started forward, gliding slowly,"
2426,_PART V._,"And broke the breathless silence, speaking lowly,"
2427,_PART V._,"As one grown meek, and humble in an hour,"
2428,_PART V._,Bowing before some new and mighty power.
2429,_PART V._,
2430,_PART V._,"""Maurine, Maurine!"" she murmured, and again,"
2431,_PART V._,"""Maurine, my own sweet friend, Maurine!"""
2432,_PART V._,"And then,"
2433,_PART V._,"Laying her love light hands upon my head,"
2434,_PART V._,"She leaned, and looked into my eyes, and said"
2435,_PART V._,"With voice that bore her joy in ev'ry tone,"
2436,_PART V._,As winds that blow across a garden bed
2437,_PART V._,"Are weighed with fragrance, ""He is mine alone,"
2438,_PART V._,And I am his--all his--his very own.
2439,_PART V._,"So pledged this hour, by that most sacred tie"
2440,_PART V._,Save one beneath God's over-arching sky.
2441,_PART V._,I could not wait to tell you of my bliss:
2442,_PART V._,"I want your blessing, sweetheart! and your kiss."""
2443,_PART V._,"So hiding my heart's trouble with a smile,"
2444,_PART V._,I leaned and kissed her dainty mouth; the while
2445,_PART V._,"I felt a guilt-joy, as of some sweet sin,"
2446,_PART V._,When my lips fell where his so late had been.
2447,_PART V._,And all day long I bore about with me
2448,_PART V._,"A sense of shame--yet mixed with satisfaction,"
2449,_PART V._,"As some starved child might steal a loaf, and be"
2450,_PART V._,"Sad with the guilt resulting from her action,"
2451,_PART V._,While yet the morsel in her mouth was sweet.
2452,_PART V._,That ev'ning when the house had settled down
2453,_PART V._,"To sleep and quiet, to my room there crept"
2454,_PART V._,"A lithe young form, robed in a long white gown:"
2455,_PART V._,"With steps like fall of thistle-down she came,"
2456,_PART V._,"Her mouth smile-wreathed; and, breathing low my name,"
2457,_PART V._,Nestled in graceful beauty at my feet.
2458,_PART V._,
2459,_PART V._,"""Sweetheart,"" she murmured softly, ""ere I sleep,"
2460,_PART V._,I needs must tell you all my tale of joy.
2461,_PART V._,Beginning where you left us--you and Roy.
2462,_PART V._,You saw the color flame upon my cheek
2463,_PART V._,When Vivian spoke of staying. So did he;--
2464,_PART V._,"And, when we were alone, he gazed at me"
2465,_PART V._,With such a strange look in his wond'rous eyes.
2466,_PART V._,The silence deepened; and I tried to speak
2467,_PART V._,"Upon some common topic, but could not,"
2468,_PART V._,My heart was in such tumult.
2469,_PART V._,In this wise
2470,_PART V._,"Five happy moments glided by us, fraught"
2471,_PART V._,"With hours of feeling. Vivian rose up then,"
2472,_PART V._,"And came and stood by me, and stroked my hair."
2473,_PART V._,"And, in his low voice, o'er and o'er again,"
2474,_PART V._,"Said, 'Helen, little Helen, frail and fair.'"
2475,_PART V._,"Then took my face, and turned it to the light,"
2476,_PART V._,"And looking in my eyes, and seeing what"
2477,_PART V._,"Was shining from them, murmured, sweet and low,"
2478,_PART V._,"'Dear eyes, you cannot veil the truth from sight."
2479,_PART V._,"You love me, Helen! answer, is it so?'"
2480,_PART V._,"And I made answer straightway, 'With my life"
2481,_PART V._,"And soul and strength I love you, O my love!'"
2482,_PART V._,"He leaned and took me gently to his breast,"
2483,_PART V._,"And said, 'Here then this dainty head shall rest"
2484,_PART V._,Henceforth forever: O my little dove!
2485,_PART V._,My lily-bud--my fragile blossom-wife!'
2486,_PART V._,
2487,_PART V._,"""And then I told him all my thoughts; and he"
2488,_PART V._,"Listened, with kisses for his comments, till"
2489,_PART V._,"My tale was finished. Then he said, 'I will"
2490,_PART V._,"Be frank with you, my darling, from the start,"
2491,_PART V._,And hide no secret from you in my heart.
2492,_PART V._,"I love you, Helen, but you are not first"
2493,_PART V._,To rouse that love to being. Ere we met
2494,_PART V._,I loved a woman madly--never dreaming
2495,_PART V._,She was not all in truth she was in seeming.
2496,_PART V._,Enough! she proved to be that thing accursed
2497,_PART V._,Of God and man--a wily vain coquette.
2498,_PART V._,I hate myself for having loved her. Yet
2499,_PART V._,"So much my heart spent on her, it must give"
2500,_PART V._,"A love less ardent, and less prodigal,"
2501,_PART V._,Albeit just as tender and as true--
2502,_PART V._,"A milder, yet a faithful love to you."
2503,_PART V._,Just as some evil fortune might befall
2504,_PART V._,"A man's great riches, causing him to live"
2505,_PART V._,"In some low cot, all unpretending, still"
2506,_PART V._,"As much his home--as much his loved retreat,"
2507,_PART V._,"As was the princely palace on the hill,"
2508,_PART V._,"E'en so I give you all that's left, my sweet!"
2509,_PART V._,Of my heart-fortune.'
2510,_PART V._,"'That were more to me,'"
2511,_PART V._,"I made swift smiling answer, 'than to be"
2512,_PART V._,The worshiped consort of a king.' And so
2513,_PART V._,Our faith was pledged. But Vivian would not go
2514,_PART V._,Until I vowed to wed him New Year day.
2515,_PART V._,And I am sad because you go away
2516,_PART V._,Before that time. I shall not feel half wed
2517,_PART V._,"Without you here. Postpone your trip and stay,"
2518,_PART V._,"And be my bridesmaid."""
2519,_PART V._,"""Nay, I cannot, dear!"
2520,_PART V._,'Twould disarrange our plans for half a year.
2521,_PART V._,"I'll be in Europe New Year day,"" I said,"
2522,_PART V._,"""And send congratulations by the cable."""
2523,_PART V._,And from my soul thanked Providence for sparing
2524,_PART V._,"The pain, to me, of sharing in, and wearing"
2525,_PART V._,"The festal garments of a wedding scene,"
2526,_PART V._,While all my heart was hung with sorrow's sable.
2527,_PART V._,"Forgetting for a season, that between"
2528,_PART V._,"The cup and lip lies many a chance of loss,"
2529,_PART V._,"I lived in my near future, confident"
2530,_PART V._,"All would be as I planned it; and, across"
2531,_PART V._,"The briny waste of waters, I should find"
2532,_PART V._,Some balm and comfort for my troubled mind.
2533,_PART V._,"The sad Fall days, like maidens auburn-tressed"
2534,_PART V._,"And amber-eyed, in purple garments dressed,"
2535,_PART V._,"Passed by, and dropped their tears upon the tomb"
2536,_PART V._,"Of fair Queen Summer, buried in her bloom."
2537,_PART V._,
2538,_PART V._,"Roy left us for a time, and Helen went"
2539,_PART V._,"To make the nuptial preparations. Then,"
2540,_PART V._,Aunt Ruth complained one day of feeling ill:
2541,_PART V._,Her veins ran red with fever; and the skill
2542,_PART V._,Of two physicians could not stem the tide.
2543,_PART V._,"The house, that rang so late with laugh and jest,"
2544,_PART V._,Grew ghostly with low whispered sounds; and when
2545,_PART V._,"The Autumn day, that I had thought to be"
2546,_PART V._,"Bounding upon the billows of the sea,"
2547,_PART V._,"Came sobbing in, it found me pale and worn,"
2548,_PART V._,Striving to keep away that unloved guest
2549,_PART V._,"Who comes unbidden, making hearts to mourn."
2550,_PART V._,Through all the anxious weeks I watched beside
2551,_PART V._,"The suff'rer's couch, Roy was my help and stay;"
2552,_PART V._,"Others were kind, but he alone each day"
2553,_PART V._,"Brought strength and comfort, by his cheerful face,"
2554,_PART V._,"And hopeful words, that fell in that sad place"
2555,_PART V._,Like rays of light upon a darkened way.
2556,_PART V._,"November passed; and Winter, crisp and chill,"
2557,_PART V._,In robes of ermine walked on plain and hill.
2558,_PART V._,Returning light and life dispelled the gloom
2559,_PART V._,That cheated Death had brought us from the tomb.
2560,_PART V._,"Aunt Ruth was saved, and slowly getting better--"
2561,_PART V._,"Was dressed each day, and walked about the room."
2562,_PART V._,"Then came one morning in the Eastern mail,"
2563,_PART V._,A little white-winged birdling of a letter.
2564,_PART V._,"I broke the seal and read,"
2565,_PART V._,"""Maurine, my own!"
2566,_PART V._,"I hear Aunt Ruth is better, and am glad."
2567,_PART V._,I felt so sorry for you; and so sad
2568,_PART V._,To think I left you when I did--alone
2569,_PART V._,"To bear your pain and worry, and those nights"
2570,_PART V._,"Of weary, anxious watching."
2571,_PART V._,Vivian writes
2572,_PART V._,"Your plans are changed now, and you will not sail"
2573,_PART V._,Before the Springtime. So you'll come and be
2574,_PART V._,"My bridesmaid, darling! Do not say me nay."
2575,_PART V._,But three weeks more of girlhood left to me.
2576,_PART V._,"Come, if you can, just two weeks from to-day,"
2577,_PART V._,And make your preparations here. My sweet!
2578,_PART V._,Indeed I am not glad Aunt Ruth was ill--
2579,_PART V._,I'm sorry she has suffered so; and still
2580,_PART V._,"I'm thankful something happened, so you stayed."
2581,_PART V._,I'm sure my wedding would be incomplete
2582,_PART V._,"Without your presence. Selfish, I'm afraid"
2583,_PART V._,"You'll think your Helen. But I love you so,"
2584,_PART V._,How can I be quite willing you should go?
2585,_PART V._,"Come Christmas Eve, or earlier. Let me know"
2586,_PART V._,"And I will meet you, dearie! at the train."
2587,_PART V._,"Your happy, loving Helen."""
2588,_PART V._,Then the pain
2589,_PART V._,"That, hidden under later pain and care,"
2590,_PART V._,"Had made no moan, but silent, seemed to sleep,"
2591,_PART V._,"Woke from its trance-like lethargy, to steep"
2592,_PART V._,My tortured heart in anguish and despair.
2593,_PART V._,
2594,_PART V._,I had relied too fully on my skill
2595,_PART V._,In bending circumstances to my will:
2596,_PART V._,And now I was rebuked and made to see
2597,_PART V._,That God alone knoweth what is to be.
2598,_PART V._,"Then came a messenger from Vivian, who"
2599,_PART V._,"Came not himself, as he was wont to do,"
2600,_PART V._,But sent his servant each new day to bring
2601,_PART V._,"A kindly message, or an offering"
2602,_PART V._,"Of juicy fruits to cool the lips of fever,"
2603,_PART V._,"Or dainty hot-house blossoms, with their bloom"
2604,_PART V._,To brighten up the convalescent's room.
2605,_PART V._,But now the servant only brought a line
2606,_PART V._,"From Vivian Dangerfield to Roy Montaine,"
2607,_PART V._,"""Dear Sir, and Friend""--in letters bold and plain,"
2608,_PART V._,"Written on cream-white paper, so it ran:"
2609,_PART V._,"""It is the will and pleasure of Miss Trevor,"
2610,_PART V._,"And therefore doubly so a wish of mine,"
2611,_PART V._,"That you shall honor me next New Year Eve,"
2612,_PART V._,"My wedding hour, by standing as best man."
2613,_PART V._,Miss Trevor has six bridesmaids I believe.
2614,_PART V._,Being myself a novice in the art--
2615,_PART V._,"If I should fail in acting well my part,"
2616,_PART V._,I'll need protection 'gainst the regiment
2617,_PART V._,"Of outraged ladies. So, I pray, consent"
2618,_PART V._,"To stand by me in time of need, and shield"
2619,_PART V._,"Your friend sincerely, Vivian Dangerfield."""
2620,_PART V._,
2621,_PART V._,"The last least hope had vanished; I must drain,"
2622,_PART V._,"E'en to the dregs, this bitter cup of pain."
2623,_PART V._,
2624,_PART V._,
2625,_PART VI._,_PART VI._
2626,_PART VI._,
2627,_PART VI._,There was a week of bustle and of hurry;
2628,_PART VI._,"A stately home echoed to voices sweet,"
2629,_PART VI._,"Calling, replying; and to tripping feet"
2630,_PART VI._,"Of busy bridesmaids, running to and fro,"
2631,_PART VI._,With all that girlish fluttering and flurry
2632,_PART VI._,Preceding such occasions.
2633,_PART VI._,Helen's room
2634,_PART VI._,"Was like a lily-garden, all in bloom,"
2635,_PART VI._,Decked with the dainty robes of her trousseau.
2636,_PART VI._,"My robe was fashioned by swift, skillful hands--"
2637,_PART VI._,"A thing of beauty, elegant and rich,"
2638,_PART VI._,"A mystery of loopings, puffs and bands;"
2639,_PART VI._,"And as I watched it growing, stitch by stitch,"
2640,_PART VI._,I felt as one might feel who should behold
2641,_PART VI._,"With vision trance-like, where his body lay"
2642,_PART VI._,"In deathly slumber, simulating clay,"
2643,_PART VI._,"His grave-cloth sewed together, fold on fold."
2644,_PART VI._,
2645,_PART VI._,"I lived with ev'ry nerve upon the strain,"
2646,_PART VI._,"As men go into battle; and the pain,"
2647,_PART VI._,"That, more and more, to my sad heart revealed,"
2648,_PART VI._,"Grew ghastly with its horrors, was concealed"
2649,_PART VI._,"From mortal eyes by superhuman power,"
2650,_PART VI._,"That God bestowed upon me, hour by hour."
2651,_PART VI._,
2652,_PART VI._,What night the Old Year gave unto the New
2653,_PART VI._,"The key of human happiness and woe,"
2654,_PART VI._,"The pointed stars, upon their field of blue,"
2655,_PART VI._,"Shone, white and perfect, o'er a world below,"
2656,_PART VI._,Of snow-clad beauty; all the trees were dressed
2657,_PART VI._,"In gleaming garments, decked with diadems,"
2658,_PART VI._,"Each seeming like a bridal-bidden guest,"
2659,_PART VI._,Coming o'er-laden with a gift of gems.
2660,_PART VI._,
2661,_PART VI._,The bustle of the dressing room; the sound
2662,_PART VI._,Of eager voices in discourse; the clang
2663,_PART VI._,"Of ""sweet bells jangled""; thud of steel-clad feet"
2664,_PART VI._,That beat swift music on the frozen ground--
2665,_PART VI._,"All blent together in my brain, and rang"
2666,_PART VI._,"A medley of strange noises, incomplete,"
2667,_PART VI._,And full of discords.
2668,_PART VI._,Then out on the night
2669,_PART VI._,"Streamed from this open vestibule, a light"
2670,_PART VI._,"That lit the velvet blossoms which we trod,"
2671,_PART VI._,With all the hues of those that deck the sod.
2672,_PART VI._,The grand cathedral windows were ablaze
2673,_PART VI._,"With gorgeous colors; through a sea of bloom,"
2674,_PART VI._,"Up the long aisle, to join the waiting groom,"
2675,_PART VI._,The bridal cortege passed.
2676,_PART VI._,As some lost soul
2677,_PART VI._,"Might surge on with the curious crowd, to gaze"
2678,_PART VI._,"Upon its coffined body, so I went"
2679,_PART VI._,With that glad festal throng. The organ sent
2680,_PART VI._,"Great waves of melody along the air,"
2681,_PART VI._,"That broke and fell, in liquid drops, like spray,"
2682,_PART VI._,On happy hearts that listened. But to me
2683,_PART VI._,"It sounded faintly, as if miles away,"
2684,_PART VI._,"A troubled spirit, sitting in despair"
2685,_PART VI._,"Beside the sad and ever-moaning sea,"
2686,_PART VI._,Gave utterance to sighing sounds of dole.
2687,_PART VI._,"We paused before the altar. Framed in flowers,"
2688,_PART VI._,The white-robed man of God stood forth.
2689,_PART VI._,I heard
2690,_PART VI._,The solemn service open; through long hours
2691,_PART VI._,"I seemed to stand and listen, while each word"
2692,_PART VI._,Fell on my ear as falls the sound of clay
2693,_PART VI._,Upon the coffin of the worshiped dead.
2694,_PART VI._,The stately father gave the bride away:
2695,_PART VI._,The bridegroom circled with a golden band
2696,_PART VI._,The taper finger of her dainty hand.
2697,_PART VI._,"The last imposing, binding words were said--"
2698,_PART VI._,"""What God has joined let no man put asunder""--"
2699,_PART VI._,And all my strife with self was at an end;
2700,_PART VI._,My lover was the husband of my friend.
2701,_PART VI._,
2702,_PART VI._,"How strangely, in some awful hour of pain,"
2703,_PART VI._,External trifles with our sorrows blend!
2704,_PART VI._,"I never hear the mighty organ's thunder,"
2705,_PART VI._,"I never catch the scent of heliotrope,"
2706,_PART VI._,"Nor see stained windows all ablaze with light,"
2707,_PART VI._,"Without that dizzy whirling of the brain,"
2708,_PART VI._,"And all the ghastly feeling of that night,"
2709,_PART VI._,When my sick heart relinquished love and hope.
2710,_PART VI._,
2711,_PART VI._,"The pain we feel so keenly may depart,"
2712,_PART VI._,And e'en its memory cease to haunt the heart;
2713,_PART VI._,"But some slight thing, a perfume, or a sound"
2714,_PART VI._,"Will probe the closed recesses of the wound,"
2715,_PART VI._,And for a moment bring the old-time smart.
2716,_PART VI._,
2717,_PART VI._,"Congratulations, kisses, tears and smiles,"
2718,_PART VI._,Good-byes and farewells given; then across
2719,_PART VI._,"The snowy waste of weary wintry miles,"
2720,_PART VI._,"Back to my girlhood's home, where, through each room,"
2721,_PART VI._,For evermore pale phantoms of delight
2722,_PART VI._,"Should aimless wander, always in my sight,"
2723,_PART VI._,"Pointing, with ghostly fingers, to the tomb"
2724,_PART VI._,Wet with the tears of living pain and loss.
2725,_PART VI._,
2726,_PART VI._,"The sleepless nights of watching and of care,"
2727,_PART VI._,"Followed by that one week of keenest pain,"
2728,_PART VI._,"Taxing my weakened system, and my brain,"
2729,_PART VI._,Brought on a ling'ring illness.
2730,_PART VI._,"Day by day,"
2731,_PART VI._,"In that strange, apathetic state I lay,"
2732,_PART VI._,Of mental and of physical despair.
2733,_PART VI._,"I had no pain, no fever, and no chill,"
2734,_PART VI._,"But lay without ambition, strength, or will,"
2735,_PART VI._,"Knowing no wish for anything but rest,"
2736,_PART VI._,"Which seemed, of all God's store of gifts, the best."
2737,_PART VI._,
2738,_PART VI._,Physicians came and shook their heads and sighed;
2739,_PART VI._,"And to their score of questions I replied,"
2740,_PART VI._,"With but one languid answer, o'er and o'er."
2741,_PART VI._,"""I am so weary--weary--nothing more."""
2742,_PART VI._,
2743,_PART VI._,"I slept, and dreamed I was some feathered thing,"
2744,_PART VI._,"Flying through space with ever-aching wing,"
2745,_PART VI._,"Seeking a ship called Rest all snowy white,"
2746,_PART VI._,"That sailed and sailed before me, just in sight,"
2747,_PART VI._,"But always one unchanging distance kept,"
2748,_PART VI._,And woke more weary than before I slept.
2749,_PART VI._,
2750,_PART VI._,"I slept, and dreamed I ran to win a prize."
2751,_PART VI._,A hand from heaven held down before my eyes.
2752,_PART VI._,"All eagerness I sought it--it was gone,"
2753,_PART VI._,But shone in all its beauty farther on.
2754,_PART VI._,"I ran, and ran, and ran, in eager quest"
2755,_PART VI._,"Of that great prize, whereon was written ""rest,"""
2756,_PART VI._,"Which ever just beyond my reach did gleam,"
2757,_PART VI._,And wakened doubly weary with my dream.
2758,_PART VI._,
2759,_PART VI._,"I dreamed I was a crystal drop of rain,"
2760,_PART VI._,"That saw a snow-white lily on the plain,"
2761,_PART VI._,And left the cloud to nestle in her breast.
2762,_PART VI._,"I fell and fell, but nevermore found rest--"
2763,_PART VI._,"I fell and fell, but found no stopping place,"
2764,_PART VI._,"Through leagues and leagues of never-ending space,"
2765,_PART VI._,While space illimitable stretched before.
2766,_PART VI._,
2767,_PART VI._,And all these dreams but wearied me the more.
2768,_PART VI._,
2769,_PART VI._,Familiar voices sounded in my room--
2770,_PART VI._,"Aunt Ruth's and Roy's, and Helen's: but they seemed"
2771,_PART VI._,"A part of some strange fancy I had dreamed,"
2772,_PART VI._,And now remembered dimly.
2773,_PART VI._,"Wrapped in gloom,"
2774,_PART VI._,"My mind, o'er taxed, lost hold of time at last,"
2775,_PART VI._,"Ignored its future, and forgot its past,"
2776,_PART VI._,"And groped along the present, as a light,"
2777,_PART VI._,"Carried, uncovered, through the fogs of night,"
2778,_PART VI._,Will flicker faintly.
2779,_PART VI._,"But I felt, at length,"
2780,_PART VI._,"When March winds brought vague rumors of the spring,"
2781,_PART VI._,"A certain sense of ""restlessness with rest."""
2782,_PART VI._,"My aching frame was weary of repose,"
2783,_PART VI._,And wanted action.
2784,_PART VI._,
2785,_PART VI._,Then slow-creeping strength
2786,_PART VI._,"Came back with Mem'ry, hand in hand, to bring"
2787,_PART VI._,"And lay upon my sore and bleeding breast,"
2788,_PART VI._,Grim-visaged Recollection's thorny rose.
2789,_PART VI._,"I gained, and failed. One day could ride and walk,"
2790,_PART VI._,The next would find me prostrate: while a flock
2791,_PART VI._,"Of ghostly thoughts, like phantom birds, would flit"
2792,_PART VI._,"About the chambers of my heart, or sit,"
2793,_PART VI._,"Pale spectres of the past, with folded wings,"
2794,_PART VI._,"Perched, silently, upon the voiceless strings,"
2795,_PART VI._,That once resounded to Hope's happy lays.
2796,_PART VI._,
2797,_PART VI._,So passed the ever-changing April days.
2798,_PART VI._,"When May came, lightsome footed, o'er the lea,"
2799,_PART VI._,"Accompanied by kind Aunt Ruth and Roy,"
2800,_PART VI._,"I bade farewell to home with secret joy,"
2801,_PART VI._,And turned my wan face eastward to the sea.
2802,_PART VI._,Roy planned our route of travel: for all lands
2803,_PART VI._,"Were one to him. Or Egypt's burning sands,"
2804,_PART VI._,"Or Alps of Switzerland, or stately Rome,"
2805,_PART VI._,All were familiar as the fields of home.
2806,_PART VI._,
2807,_PART VI._,"There was a year of wand'ring to and fro,"
2808,_PART VI._,Like restless spirits; scaling mountain heights;
2809,_PART VI._,"Dwelling among the countless, rare delights"
2810,_PART VI._,"Of lands historic; turning dusty pages,"
2811,_PART VI._,Stamped with the tragedies of mighty ages;
2812,_PART VI._,"Gazing upon the scenes of bloody acts,"
2813,_PART VI._,"Of kings long buried--bare, unvarnished facts,"
2814,_PART VI._,Surpassing wildest fictions of the brain;
2815,_PART VI._,"Rubbing against all people, high and low,"
2816,_PART VI._,And by this contact feeling Self to grow
2817,_PART VI._,"Smaller and less important, and the vein"
2818,_PART VI._,"Of human kindness deeper, seeing God,"
2819,_PART VI._,"Unto the humble delver of the sod,"
2820,_PART VI._,"And to the ruling monarch on the throne,"
2821,_PART VI._,"Has given hope, ambition, joy, and pain,"
2822,_PART VI._,And that all hearts have feelings like our own.
2823,_PART VI._,
2824,_PART VI._,"There is no school that disciplines the mind,"
2825,_PART VI._,"And broadens thought, like contact with mankind."
2826,_PART VI._,"The college-prisoned greybeard, who has burned"
2827,_PART VI._,"The midnight lamp, and book-bound knowledge learned,"
2828,_PART VI._,Till sciences or classics hold no lore
2829,_PART VI._,"He has not conned and studied, o'er and o'er,"
2830,_PART VI._,"Is but a babe in wisdom, when compared"
2831,_PART VI._,"With some unlettered wand'rer, who has shared"
2832,_PART VI._,The hospitalities of every land;
2833,_PART VI._,Felt touch of brother in each proffered hand;
2834,_PART VI._,"Made man his study, and the world his college,"
2835,_PART VI._,And gained this grand epitome of knowledge:
2836,_PART VI._,"Each human being has a heart and soul,"
2837,_PART VI._,And self is but an atom of the whole.
2838,_PART VI._,"I hold he is best learnèd and most wise,"
2839,_PART VI._,Who best and most can love and sympathize.
2840,_PART VI._,Book-wisdom makes us vain and self-contained;
2841,_PART VI._,Our banded minds go round in little grooves;
2842,_PART VI._,But constant friction with the world removes
2843,_PART VI._,"These iron foes to freedom, and we rise"
2844,_PART VI._,"To grander heights, and, all untrammeled, find"
2845,_PART VI._,A better atmosphere and clearer skies;
2846,_PART VI._,"And through its broadened realm, no longer chained,"
2847,_PART VI._,"Thought travels freely, leaving Self behind."
2848,_PART VI._,"Where'er we chanced to wander or to roam,"
2849,_PART VI._,"Glad letters came from Helen; happy things,"
2850,_PART VI._,"Like little birds that followed on swift wings,"
2851,_PART VI._,Bringing their tender messages from home.
2852,_PART VI._,"Her days were poems, beautiful, complete."
2853,_PART VI._,"The rhythm perfect, and the burden sweet."
2854,_PART VI._,"She was so happy--happy, and so blest."
2855,_PART VI._,
2856,_PART VI._,My heart had found contentment in that year.
2857,_PART VI._,"With health restored, my life seemed full of cheer"
2858,_PART VI._,The heart of youth turns ever to the light;
2859,_PART VI._,"Sorrow and gloom may curtain it like night,"
2860,_PART VI._,"But, in its very anguish and unrest,"
2861,_PART VI._,"It beats and tears the pall-like folds away,"
2862,_PART VI._,And finds again the sunlight of the day.
2863,_PART VI._,
2864,_PART VI._,"And yet, despite the changes without measure,"
2865,_PART VI._,"Despite sight-seeing, round on round of pleasure;"
2866,_PART VI._,"Despite new friends, new suitors, still my heart"
2867,_PART VI._,"Was conscious of a something lacking, where"
2868,_PART VI._,"Love once had dwelt, and afterward despair."
2869,_PART VI._,Now love was buried; and despair had flown
2870,_PART VI._,Before the healthful zephyrs that had blown
2871,_PART VI._,From heights serene and lofty; and the place
2872,_PART VI._,"Where both had dwelt, was empty, voiceless space"
2873,_PART VI._,"And so I took my long-loved study, art,"
2874,_PART VI._,"The dreary vacuum in my life to fill,"
2875,_PART VI._,"And worked, and labored, with a right good will."
2876,_PART VI._,Aunt Ruth and I took rooms in Rome; while Roy
2877,_PART VI._,"Lingered in Scotland, with his new-found joy."
2878,_PART VI._,"A dainty little lassie, Grace Kildare,"
2879,_PART VI._,"Had snared him in her flossy, flaxen hair,"
2880,_PART VI._,And made him captive.
2881,_PART VI._,"We were thrown, by chance,"
2882,_PART VI._,In contact with her people while in France
2883,_PART VI._,The previous season: she was wholly sweet
2884,_PART VI._,"And fair and gentle; so näive, and yet"
2885,_PART VI._,"So womanly, she was at once the pet"
2886,_PART VI._,"Of all our party; and, ere many days,"
2887,_PART VI._,"Won by her fresh face, and her artless ways,"
2888,_PART VI._,Roy fell a helpless captive at her feet.
2889,_PART VI._,Her home was in the Highlands; and she came
2890,_PART VI._,"Of good old stock, of fair untarnished fame."
2891,_PART VI._,
2892,_PART VI._,Through all these months Roy had been true as steel;
2893,_PART VI._,And by his every action made me feel
2894,_PART VI._,"He was my friend and brother, and no more."
2895,_PART VI._,The same big-souled and trusty friend of yore.
2896,_PART VI._,"Yet, in my secret heart, I wished I knew"
2897,_PART VI._,"Whether the love he felt one time was dead,"
2898,_PART VI._,"Or only hidden, for my sake, from view."
2899,_PART VI._,"So when he came to me one day, and said,"
2900,_PART VI._,The velvet blackness of his eyes ashine
2901,_PART VI._,"With light of love and triumph: ""Cousin, mine,"
2902,_PART VI._,Congratulate me! She whom I adore
2903,_PART VI._,Has pledged to me the promise of her hand;
2904,_PART VI._,"Her heart I have already,"" I was glad"
2905,_PART VI._,"With double gladness, for it freed my mind"
2906,_PART VI._,"Of fear that he, in secret, might be sad."
2907,_PART VI._,
2908,_PART VI._,"From March till June had left her moons behind,"
2909,_PART VI._,"And merged her rose-red beauty in July,"
2910,_PART VI._,There was no message from my native land.
2911,_PART VI._,"Then came a few brief lines, by Vivian penned:"
2912,_PART VI._,"Death had been near to Helen, but passed by;"
2913,_PART VI._,The danger was now over. God was kind;
2914,_PART VI._,The mother and the child were both alive;
2915,_PART VI._,No other child was ever known to thrive
2916,_PART VI._,"As throve this one, nurse had been heard to say."
2917,_PART VI._,"The infant was a wonder, every way."
2918,_PART VI._,"And, at command of Helen he would send"
2919,_PART VI._,A lock of baby's golden hair to me.
2920,_PART VI._,"And did I, on my honor, ever see"
2921,_PART VI._,"Such hair before? Helen would write, ere long:"
2922,_PART VI._,"She gained quite slowly, but would soon be strong--"
2923,_PART VI._,"Stronger than ever, so the doctors said."
2924,_PART VI._,"I took the tiny ringlet, golden--fair,"
2925,_PART VI._,Mayhap his hand had severed from the head
2926,_PART VI._,"Of his own child, and pressed it to my cheek"
2927,_PART VI._,"And to my lips, and kissed it o'er and o'er."
2928,_PART VI._,"All my maternal instincts seemed to rise,"
2929,_PART VI._,"And clamor for their rights, while my wet eyes,"
2930,_PART VI._,Rained tears upon the silken tress of hair.
2931,_PART VI._,The woman struggled with her heart before!
2932,_PART VI._,"It was the mother in me now did speak,"
2933,_PART VI._,"Moaning, like Rachel, that her babes were not,"
2934,_PART VI._,And crying out against her barren lot.
2935,_PART VI._,
2936,_PART VI._,Once I bemoaned the long and lonely years
2937,_PART VI._,"That stretched before me, dark with love's eclipse;"
2938,_PART VI._,And thought how my unmated heart would miss
2939,_PART VI._,The shelter of a broad and manly breast--
2940,_PART VI._,"The strong, bold arm--the tender clinging kiss--"
2941,_PART VI._,"And all pure love's possessions, manifold;"
2942,_PART VI._,"But now I wept a flood of bitter tears,"
2943,_PART VI._,"Thinking of little heads of shining gold,"
2944,_PART VI._,That would not on my bosom sink to rest;
2945,_PART VI._,Of little hands that would not touch my cheek;
2946,_PART VI._,"Of little lisping voices, and sweet lips,"
2947,_PART VI._,That never in my list'ning ear would speak
2948,_PART VI._,The blessed name of mother.
2949,_PART VI._,"Oh, in woman"
2950,_PART VI._,How mighty is the love of offspring! Ere
2951,_PART VI._,"Unto her wond'ring, untaught mind unfolds"
2952,_PART VI._,"The myst'ry that is half divine, half human,"
2953,_PART VI._,"Of life and birth, the love of unborn souls"
2954,_PART VI._,"Within her, and the mother-yearning creeps"
2955,_PART VI._,"Through her warm heart, and stirs its hidden deeps,"
2956,_PART VI._,And grows and strengthens with each riper year.
2957,_PART VI._,
2958,_PART VI._,"As storms may gather in a placid sky,"
2959,_PART VI._,"And spend their fury, and then pass away,"
2960,_PART VI._,"Leaving again the blue of cloudless day,"
2961,_PART VI._,E'en so the tempest of my grief passed by.
2962,_PART VI._,"'T was weak to mourn for what I had resigned,"
2963,_PART VI._,"With the deliberate purpose of my mind,"
2964,_PART VI._,To my sweet friend.
2965,_PART VI._,"Relinquishing my love,"
2966,_PART VI._,I gave my dearest hope of joy to her.
2967,_PART VI._,"If God, from out his boundless store above,"
2968,_PART VI._,"Had chosen added blessings to confer,"
2969,_PART VI._,"I would rejoice, for her sake--not repine"
2970,_PART VI._,That th' immortal treasures were not mine.
2971,_PART VI._,
2972,_PART VI._,"Better my lonely sorrow, than to know"
2973,_PART VI._,My selfish joy had been another's woe;
2974,_PART VI._,"Better my grief and my strength to control,"
2975,_PART VI._,Than the despair of her frail-bodied soul;
2976,_PART VI._,"Better to go on, loveless, to the end,"
2977,_PART VI._,"Than wear love's rose, whose thorn had slain my friend."
2978,_PART VI._,
2979,_PART VI._,Work is the salve that heals the wounded heart.
2980,_PART VI._,With will most resolute I set my aim
2981,_PART VI._,"To enter on the weary race for Fame,"
2982,_PART VI._,"And if I failed to climb the dizzy height,"
2983,_PART VI._,To reach some point of excellence in art.
2984,_PART VI._,
2985,_PART VI._,"E'en as the Maker held earth incomplete,"
2986,_PART VI._,"Till man was formed, and placed upon the sod,"
2987,_PART VI._,"The perfect, living image of his God,"
2988,_PART VI._,"All landscape scenes were lacking in my sight,"
2989,_PART VI._,Wherein the human figure had no part.
2990,_PART VI._,"In that, all lines of symmetry did meet--"
2991,_PART VI._,All hues of beauty mingle. So I brought
2992,_PART VI._,"Enthusiasm in abundance, thought,"
2993,_PART VI._,"Much study, and some talent, day by day,"
2994,_PART VI._,To help me in my efforts to portray
2995,_PART VI._,"The wond'rous power, majesty and grace"
2996,_PART VI._,"Stamped on some form, or looking from some face."
2997,_PART VI._,This was to be my specialty: To take
2998,_PART VI._,"Human emotion for my theme, and make"
2999,_PART VI._,The unassisted form divine express
3000,_PART VI._,"Anger or Sorrow, Pleasure, Pain, Distress;"
3001,_PART VI._,And thus to build Fame's monument above
3002,_PART VI._,The grave of my departed hope and love.
3003,_PART VI._,
3004,_PART VI._,This is not Genius. Genius spreads its wings
3005,_PART VI._,"And soars beyond itself, or selfish things."
3006,_PART VI._,"Talent has need of stepping-stones: some cross,"
3007,_PART VI._,"Some cheated purpose, some great pain or loss,"
3008,_PART VI._,"Must lay the groundwork, and arouse ambition,"
3009,_PART VI._,Before it labors onward to fruition.
3010,_PART VI._,
3011,_PART VI._,"But, as the lark from beds of bloom will rise"
3012,_PART VI._,"And sail and sing among the very skies,"
3013,_PART VI._,"Still mounting near and nearer to the light,"
3014,_PART VI._,"Impelled alone by love of upward flight,"
3015,_PART VI._,So Genius soars--it does not need to climb--
3016,_PART VI._,"Upon God-given wings, to heights sublime."
3017,_PART VI._,"Some sportman's shot, grazing the singer's throat,"
3018,_PART VI._,"Some venomous assault of birds of prey,"
3019,_PART VI._,"May speed its flight toward the realm of day,"
3020,_PART VI._,And tinge with triumph every liquid note.
3021,_PART VI._,"So deathless Genius mounts but higher yet,"
3022,_PART VI._,When Strife and Envy think to slay or fret.
3023,_PART VI._,
3024,_PART VI._,There is no balking Genius. Only death
3025,_PART VI._,"Can silence it, or hinder. While there's breath"
3026,_PART VI._,"Or sense of feeling, it will spurn the sod,"
3027,_PART VI._,"And lift itself to glory, and to God."
3028,_PART VI._,The acorn sprouted--weeds nor flowers can choke
3029,_PART VI._,The certain growth of th' upreaching oak.
3030,_PART VI._,
3031,_PART VI._,"Talent was mine, not Genius; and my mind"
3032,_PART VI._,"Seemed bound by chains, and would not leave behind"
3033,_PART VI._,Its selfish love and sorrow.
3034,_PART VI._,Did I strive
3035,_PART VI._,"To picture some emotion, lo! _his_ eyes,"
3036,_PART VI._,"Of emerald beauty, dark as ocean dyes,"
3037,_PART VI._,Looked from the canvas: and my buried pain
3038,_PART VI._,"Rose from its grave, and stood by me alive."
3039,_PART VI._,"Whate'er my subject, in some hue or line,"
3040,_PART VI._,The glorious beauty of his face would shine.
3041,_PART VI._,
3042,_PART VI._,"So for a time my labor seemed in vain,"
3043,_PART VI._,"Since it but freshened, and made keener yet,"
3044,_PART VI._,The grief my heart was striving to forget.
3045,_PART VI._,
3046,_PART VI._,While in his form all strength and magnitude
3047,_PART VI._,"With grace and supple sinews were entwined,"
3048,_PART VI._,While in his face all beauties were combined
3049,_PART VI._,"Of perfect features, intellect and truth,"
3050,_PART VI._,"With all that fine rich coloring of youth,"
3051,_PART VI._,How could my brush portray aught good or fair
3052,_PART VI._,Wherein no fatal likeness should intrude
3053,_PART VI._,Of him my soul had worshiped?
3054,_PART VI._,"But, at last,"
3055,_PART VI._,Setting a watch upon my unwise heart
3056,_PART VI._,"That thus would mix its sorrow with my art,"
3057,_PART VI._,"I resolutely shut away the past,"
3058,_PART VI._,And made the toilsome present passing bright
3059,_PART VI._,With dreams of what was hidden from my sight
3060,_PART VI._,"In the far distant future, when the soil"
3061,_PART VI._,Should yield me golden fruit for all my toil.
3062,_PART VI._,
3063,_PART VI._,
3064,_PART VII._,_PART VII._
3065,_PART VII._,
3066,_PART VII._,"With much hard labor and some pleasure fraught,"
3067,_PART VII._,"The months rolled by me noiselessly, that taught"
3068,_PART VII._,"My hand to grow more skillful in its art,"
3069,_PART VII._,"Strengthened my daring dream of fame, and brought"
3070,_PART VII._,Sweet hope and resignation to my heart.
3071,_PART VII._,
3072,_PART VII._,"Brief letters came from Helen, now and then:"
3073,_PART VII._,"She was quite well--oh, yes! quite well, indeed!"
3074,_PART VII._,"But still so weak and nervous. By and by,"
3075,_PART VII._,"When baby, being older, should not need"
3076,_PART VII._,"Such constant care, she would grow strong again."
3077,_PART VII._,She was as happy as a soul could be;
3078,_PART VII._,No least cloud hovered in her azure sky;
3079,_PART VII._,She had not thought life held such depths of bliss.
3080,_PART VII._,"Dear baby sent Maurine a loving kiss,"
3081,_PART VII._,"And said she was a naughty, naughty girl,"
3082,_PART VII._,Not to come home and see ma's little pearl.
3083,_PART VII._,
3084,_PART VII._,"No gift of costly jewels, or of gold,"
3085,_PART VII._,"Had been so precious or so dear to me,"
3086,_PART VII._,As each brief line wherein her joy was told.
3087,_PART VII._,"It lightened toil, and took the edge from pain,"
3088,_PART VII._,Knowing my sacrifice was not in vain.
3089,_PART VII._,
3090,_PART VII._,"Roy purchased fine estates in Scotland, where"
3091,_PART VII._,He built a pretty villa-like retreat.
3092,_PART VII._,And when the Roman Summer's languid heat
3093,_PART VII._,"Made work a punishment, I turned my face"
3094,_PART VII._,"Toward the Highlands, and with Roy and Grace"
3095,_PART VII._,Found rest and freedom from all thought and care.
3096,_PART VII._,
3097,_PART VII._,I was a willing worker. Not an hour
3098,_PART VII._,"Passed idly by me: each, I would employ"
3099,_PART VII._,"To some good purpose, ere it glided on"
3100,_PART VII._,To swell the tide of hours forever gone.
3101,_PART VII._,"My first completed picture, known as ""Joy,"""
3102,_PART VII._,"Won pleasant words of praise. ""Possesses power,"""
3103,_PART VII._,"""Displays much talent,"" ""Very fairly done."""
3104,_PART VII._,So fell the comments on my grateful ear.
3105,_PART VII._,
3106,_PART VII._,"Swift in the wake of Joy, and always near,"
3107,_PART VII._,Walks her sad sister Sorrow. So my brush
3108,_PART VII._,"Began depicting sorrow, heavy-eyed,"
3109,_PART VII._,"With pallid visage, ere the rosy flush"
3110,_PART VII._,Upon the beaming face of Joy had dried.
3111,_PART VII._,"The careful study of long months, it won"
3112,_PART VII._,Golden opinions; even bringing forth
3113,_PART VII._,That certain sign of merit--a critique
3114,_PART VII._,"Which set both pieces down as daubs, and weak"
3115,_PART VII._,As empty heads that sang their praises--so
3116,_PART VII._,Proving conclusively the pictures' worth.
3117,_PART VII._,These critics and reviewers do not use
3118,_PART VII._,Their precious ammunition to abuse
3119,_PART VII._,"A worthless work. That, left alone, they know"
3120,_PART VII._,Will find its proper level; and they aim
3121,_PART VII._,Their batteries at rising works which claim
3122,_PART VII._,Too much of public notice. But this shot
3123,_PART VII._,"Resulted only in some noise, which brought"
3124,_PART VII._,"A dozen people, where one came before"
3125,_PART VII._,To view my pictures; and I had my hour
3126,_PART VII._,"Of holding those frail baubles, Fame and Pow'r."
3127,_PART VII._,An English Baron who had lived two score
3128,_PART VII._,"Of his allotted three score years and ten,"
3129,_PART VII._,"Bought both the pieces. He was very kind,"
3130,_PART VII._,"And so attentive, I, not being blind,"
3131,_PART VII._,Must understand his meaning.
3132,_PART VII._,"Therefore, when"
3133,_PART VII._,"He said,"
3134,_PART VII._,"""Sweet friend, whom I would make my wife,"
3135,_PART VII._,The 'Joy' and 'Sorrow' this dear hand portrayed
3136,_PART VII._,I have in my possession: now resign
3137,_PART VII._,"Into my careful keeping, and make mine,"
3138,_PART VII._,"The joy and sorrow of your future life,""--"
3139,_PART VII._,"I was prepared to answer, but delayed,"
3140,_PART VII._,Grown undecided suddenly.
3141,_PART VII._,My mind
3142,_PART VII._,"Argued the matter coolly pro and con,"
3143,_PART VII._,And made resolve to speed his wooing on
3144,_PART VII._,And grant him favor. He was good and kind;
3145,_PART VII._,"Not young, no doubt he would be quite content"
3146,_PART VII._,"With my respect, nor miss an ardent love;"
3147,_PART VII._,Could give me ties of family and home;
3148,_PART VII._,"And then, perhaps, my mind was not above"
3149,_PART VII._,Setting some value on a titled name--
3150,_PART VII._,Ambitious woman's weakness!
3151,_PART VII._,Then my art
3152,_PART VII._,"Would be encouraged and pursued the same,"
3153,_PART VII._,And I could spend my winters all in Rome.
3154,_PART VII._,Love never more could touch my wasteful heart
3155,_PART VII._,That all its wealth upon one object spent.
3156,_PART VII._,"Existence would be very bleak and cold,"
3157,_PART VII._,"After long years, when I was gray and old,"
3158,_PART VII._,With neither home nor children.
3159,_PART VII._,"Once a wife,"
3160,_PART VII._,"I would forget the sorrow of my life,"
3161,_PART VII._,And pile new sods upon the grave of pain.
3162,_PART VII._,"My mind so argued; and my sad heart heard,"
3163,_PART VII._,But made no comment.
3164,_PART VII._,"Then the Baron spoke,"
3165,_PART VII._,And waited for my answer. All in vain
3166,_PART VII._,I strove for strength to utter that one word
3167,_PART VII._,My mind dictated. Moments rolled away--
3168,_PART VII._,"Until at last my torpid heart awoke,"
3169,_PART VII._,And forced my trembling lips to say him nay.
3170,_PART VII._,"And then my eyes with sudden tears o'erran,"
3171,_PART VII._,In pity for myself and for this man
3172,_PART VII._,"Who stood before me, lost in pained surprise."
3173,_PART VII._,"""Dear friend,"" I cried, ""Dear generous friend forgive"
3174,_PART VII._,"A troubled woman's weakness! As I live,"
3175,_PART VII._,In truth I meant to answer otherwise.
3176,_PART VII._,"From out its store, my heart can give you naught"
3177,_PART VII._,But honor and respect; and yet methought
3178,_PART VII._,"I would give willing answer, did you sue."
3179,_PART VII._,But now I know 'twere cruel wrong I planned;
3180,_PART VII._,"Taking a heart that beat with love most true,"
3181,_PART VII._,And giving in exchange an empty hand.
3182,_PART VII._,"Who weds for love alone, may not be wise:"
3183,_PART VII._,"Who weds without it, angels must despise."
3184,_PART VII._,Love and respect together must combine
3185,_PART VII._,To render marriage holy and divine;
3186,_PART VII._,"And lack of either, sure as Fate, destroys"
3187,_PART VII._,"Continuation of the nuptial joys,"
3188,_PART VII._,"And brings regret, and gloomy discontent,"
3189,_PART VII._,To put to rout each tender sentiment.
3190,_PART VII._,"Nay, nay! I will not burden all your life"
3191,_PART VII._,By that possession--an unloving wife;
3192,_PART VII._,Nor will I take the sin upon my soul
3193,_PART VII._,Of wedding where my heart goes not in whole.
3194,_PART VII._,"However bleak may be my single lot,"
3195,_PART VII._,I will not stain my life with such a blot.
3196,_PART VII._,"Dear friend, farewell! the earth is very wide;"
3197,_PART VII._,It holds some fairer woman for your bride;
3198,_PART VII._,"I would I had a heart to give to you,"
3199,_PART VII._,"But, lacking it, can only say--adieu!"""
3200,_PART VII._,
3201,_PART VII._,"He whom temptation never has assailed,"
3202,_PART VII._,Knows not that subtle sense of moral strength;
3203,_PART VII._,"When sorely tried, we waver, but at length,"
3204,_PART VII._,"Rise up and turn away, not having failed."
3205,_PART VII._,
3206,_PART VII._,*       *       *       *       *
3207,_PART VII._,
3208,_PART VII._,The Autumn of the third year came and went;
3209,_PART VII._,"The mild Italian winter was half spent,"
3210,_PART VII._,When this brief message came across the sea:
3211,_PART VII._,"""My darling! I am dying. Come to me."
3212,_PART VII._,"Love, which so long the growing truth concealed,"
3213,_PART VII._,"Stands pale within its shadow. O, my sweet!"
3214,_PART VII._,This heart of mine grows fainter with each beat--
3215,_PART VII._,"Dying with very weight of bliss. O, come!"
3216,_PART VII._,"And take the legacy I leave to you,"
3217,_PART VII._,Before these lips forevermore are dumb.
3218,_PART VII._,"In life or death, Yours, Helen Dangerfield."""
3219,_PART VII._,
3220,_PART VII._,This plaintive letter bore a month old date;
3221,_PART VII._,"And, wild with fears lest I had come too late,"
3222,_PART VII._,I bade the old world and new friends adieu.
3223,_PART VII._,"And with Aunt Ruth, who long had sighed for home,"
3224,_PART VII._,"I turned my back on glory, art, and Rome."
3225,_PART VII._,
3226,_PART VII._,All selfish thoughts were merged in one wild fear
3227,_PART VII._,"That she for whose dear sake my heart had bled,"
3228,_PART VII._,"Rather than her sweet eyes should know one tear,"
3229,_PART VII._,Was passing from me; that she might be dead;
3230,_PART VII._,"And, dying, had been sorely grieved with me,"
3231,_PART VII._,Because I made no answer to her plea.
3232,_PART VII._,
3233,_PART VII._,"""O, ship, that sailest slowly, slowly on,"
3234,_PART VII._,Make haste before a wasting life is gone!
3235,_PART VII._,Make haste that I may catch a fleeting breath!
3236,_PART VII._,"And true in life, be true e'en unto death."
3237,_PART VII._,
3238,_PART VII._,"""O, ship, sail on! and bear me o'er the tide"
3239,_PART VII._,To her for whom my woman's heart once died.
3240,_PART VII._,"Sail, sail, O, ship! for she hath need of me,"
3241,_PART VII._,And I would know what her last wish may be!
3242,_PART VII._,"I have been true, so true, through all the past,"
3243,_PART VII._,"Sail, sail, O, ship! I would not fail at last."""
3244,_PART VII._,
3245,_PART VII._,"So prayed my heart still o'er, and ever o'er,"
3246,_PART VII._,Until the weary lagging ship reached shore.
3247,_PART VII._,"All sad with fears that I had come too late,"
3248,_PART VII._,"By that strange source whence men communicate,"
3249,_PART VII._,"Though miles on miles of space between them lie,"
3250,_PART VII._,"I spoke with Vivian: ""Does she live? Reply."""
3251,_PART VII._,"The answer came. ""She lives, but hasten, friend!"
3252,_PART VII._,"Her journey draweth swiftly to its end."""
3253,_PART VII._,
3254,_PART VII._,"Ah me! ah me! when each remembered spot,"
3255,_PART VII._,"My own dear home, the lane that led to his--"
3256,_PART VII._,"The fields, the woods, the lake, burst on my sight,"
3257,_PART VII._,"Oh! then, Self rose up in asserting might;"
3258,_PART VII._,"Oh, then, my bursting heart all else forgot,"
3259,_PART VII._,"But those sweet early years of lost delight,"
3260,_PART VII._,"Of hope, defeat, of anguish and of bliss."
3261,_PART VII._,
3262,_PART VII._,"I have a theory, vague, undefined,"
3263,_PART VII._,"That each emotion of the human mind,"
3264,_PART VII._,"Love, pain or passion, sorrow or despair,"
3265,_PART VII._,"Is a live spirit, dwelling in the air,"
3266,_PART VII._,Until it takes possession of some breast;
3267,_PART VII._,"And, when at length, grown weary of unrest,"
3268,_PART VII._,"We rise up strong and cast it from the heart,"
3269,_PART VII._,"And bid it leave us wholly, and depart,"
3270,_PART VII._,"It does not die, it cannot die; but goes"
3271,_PART VII._,And mingles with some restless wind that blows
3272,_PART VII._,About the region where it had its birth.
3273,_PART VII._,"And though we wander over all the earth,"
3274,_PART VII._,"That spirit waits, and lingers, year by year,"
3275,_PART VII._,"Invisible, and clothèd like the air,"
3276,_PART VII._,"Hoping that we may yet again draw near,"
3277,_PART VII._,"And it may haply take us unaware,"
3278,_PART VII._,And once more find safe shelter in the breast
3279,_PART VII._,It stirred of old with pleasure or unrest.
3280,_PART VII._,
3281,_PART VII._,"Told by my heart, and wholly positive,"
3282,_PART VII._,Some old emotion long had ceased to live;
3283,_PART VII._,"That, were it called, it could not hear or come,"
3284,_PART VII._,"Because it was so voiceless and so dumb,"
3285,_PART VII._,"Yet, passing where it first sprang into life,"
3286,_PART VII._,My very soul has suddenly been rife
3287,_PART VII._,With all the old intensity of feeling.
3288,_PART VII._,"It seemed a living spirit, which came stealing"
3289,_PART VII._,Into my heart from that departed day;
3290,_PART VII._,"Exiled emotion, which I fancied clay."
3291,_PART VII._,
3292,_PART VII._,"So now into my troubled heart, above"
3293,_PART VII._,"The present's pain and sorrow, crept the love"
3294,_PART VII._,"And strife and passion of a by-gone hour,"
3295,_PART VII._,Possessed of all their olden might and power.
3296,_PART VII._,"'T was but a moment, and the spell was broken"
3297,_PART VII._,"By pleasant words of greeting, gently spoken,"
3298,_PART VII._,And Vivian stood before us.
3299,_PART VII._,But I saw
3300,_PART VII._,In him the husband of my friend alone.
3301,_PART VII._,"The old emotions might at times return,"
3302,_PART VII._,And smold'ring fires leap up an hour and burn;
3303,_PART VII._,"But never yet had I transgressed God's law,"
3304,_PART VII._,"By looking on the man I had resigned,"
3305,_PART VII._,"With any hidden feeling in my mind,"
3306,_PART VII._,"Which she, his wife, my friend, might not have known."
3307,_PART VII._,He was but little altered. From his face
3308,_PART VII._,"The nonchalant and almost haughty grace,"
3309,_PART VII._,"The lurking laughter waiting in his eyes,"
3310,_PART VII._,"The years had stolen, leaving in their place"
3311,_PART VII._,"A settled sadness, which was not despair,"
3312,_PART VII._,"Nor was it gloom, nor weariness, nor care,"
3313,_PART VII._,But something like the vapor o'er the skies
3314,_PART VII._,"Of Indian summer, beautiful to see,"
3315,_PART VII._,"But spoke of frosts, which had been and would be."
3316,_PART VII._,"There was that in his face which cometh not,"
3317,_PART VII._,"Save when the soul has many a battle fought,"
3318,_PART VII._,And conquered self by constant sacrifice.
3319,_PART VII._,
3320,_PART VII._,"There are two sculptors, who, with chisels fine,"
3321,_PART VII._,Render the plainest features half divine.
3322,_PART VII._,"All other artists strive and strive in vain,"
3323,_PART VII._,To picture beauty perfect and complete.
3324,_PART VII._,"Their statues only crumble at their feet,"
3325,_PART VII._,Without the master touch of Faith and Pain.
3326,_PART VII._,"And now his face, that perfect seemed before,"
3327,_PART VII._,"Chiseled by these two careful artists, wore"
3328,_PART VII._,"A look exalted, which the spirit gives"
3329,_PART VII._,"When soul has conquered, and the body lives"
3330,_PART VII._,Subservient to its bidding.
3331,_PART VII._,
3332,_PART VII._,In a room
3333,_PART VII._,"Which curtained out the February gloom,"
3334,_PART VII._,"And, redolent with perfume, bright with flowers,"
3335,_PART VII._,"Rested the eye like one of Summer's bowers,"
3336,_PART VII._,"I found my Helen, who was less mine now"
3337,_PART VII._,"Than Death's; for on the marble of her brow,"
3338,_PART VII._,His seal was stamped indelibly.
3339,_PART VII._,Her form
3340,_PART VII._,"Was like the slendor willow, when some storm"
3341,_PART VII._,"Has stripped it bare of foliage. Her face,"
3342,_PART VII._,"Pale always, now was ghastly in its hue:"
3343,_PART VII._,"And, like two lamps, in some dark, hollow place,"
3344,_PART VII._,"Burned her large eyes, grown more intensely blue."
3345,_PART VII._,"Her fragile hands displayed each cord and vein,"
3346,_PART VII._,"And on her mouth was that drawn look, of pain"
3347,_PART VII._,Which is not uttered. Yet an inward light
3348,_PART VII._,Shone through and made her wasted features bright
3349,_PART VII._,With an unearthly beauty; and an awe
3350,_PART VII._,"Crept o'er me, gazing on her, for I saw"
3351,_PART VII._,She was so near to Heaven that I seemed
3352,_PART VII._,To look upon the face of one redeemed.
3353,_PART VII._,She turned the brilliant luster of her eyes
3354,_PART VII._,"Upon me. She had passed beyond surprise,"
3355,_PART VII._,Or any strong emotion linked with clay.
3356,_PART VII._,"But as I glided to her where she lay,"
3357,_PART VII._,"A smile, celestial in its sweetness, wreathed"
3358,_PART VII._,"Her pallid features. ""Welcome home!"" she breathed,"
3359,_PART VII._,"""Dear hands! dear lips! I touch you and rejoice."""
3360,_PART VII._,And like the dying echo of a voice
3361,_PART VII._,Were her faint tones that thrilled upon my ear.
3362,_PART VII._,
3363,_PART VII._,I fell upon my knees beside her bed;
3364,_PART VII._,"All agonies within my heart were wed,"
3365,_PART VII._,"While to the aching numbness of my grief,"
3366,_PART VII._,"Mine eyes refused the solace of a tear,--"
3367,_PART VII._,The tortured soul's most merciful relief.
3368,_PART VII._,Her wasted hand caressed my bended head
3369,_PART VII._,"For one sad, sacred moment. Then she said,"
3370,_PART VII._,"In that low tone so like the wind's refrain,"
3371,_PART VII._,"""Maurine, my own! give not away to pain;"
3372,_PART VII._,The time is precious. Ere another dawn
3373,_PART VII._,My soul may hear the summons and pass on.
3374,_PART VII._,"Arise, sweet sister! rest a little while,"
3375,_PART VII._,"And when refreshed, come hither. I grow weak"
3376,_PART VII._,With every hour that passes. I must speak
3377,_PART VII._,And make my dying wishes known to-night.
3378,_PART VII._,"Go now."" And in the halo of her smile,"
3379,_PART VII._,"Which seemed to fill the room with golden light,"
3380,_PART VII._,I turned and left her.
3381,_PART VII._,"Later in the gloom,"
3382,_PART VII._,"Of coming night, I entered that dim room,"
3383,_PART VII._,And sat down by her. Vivian held her hand:
3384,_PART VII._,"And on the pillow at her side, there smiled"
3385,_PART VII._,The beauteous count'nance of a sleeping child.
3386,_PART VII._,
3387,_PART VII._,"""Maurine,"" spoke Helen, ""for three blissful years,"
3388,_PART VII._,My heart has dwelt in an enchanted land;
3389,_PART VII._,"And I have drank the sweetened cup of joy,"
3390,_PART VII._,Without one drop of anguish or alloy.
3391,_PART VII._,"And so, ere Pain embitters it with gall,"
3392,_PART VII._,"Or sad-eyed Sorrow fills it full of tears,"
3393,_PART VII._,"And bids me quaff, which is the Fate of all"
3394,_PART VII._,"Who linger long upon this troubled way,"
3395,_PART VII._,"God takes me to the realm of Endless Day,"
3396,_PART VII._,"To mingle with his angels, who alone"
3397,_PART VII._,Can understand such bliss as I have known.
3398,_PART VII._,"I do not murmur. God has heaped my measure,"
3399,_PART VII._,"In three short years, full to the brim with pleasure;"
3400,_PART VII._,"And, from the fullness of an earthly love,"
3401,_PART VII._,"I pass to th' Immortal arms above,"
3402,_PART VII._,Before I even brush the skirts of Woe.
3403,_PART VII._,
3404,_PART VII._,"""I leave my aged parents here below,"
3405,_PART VII._,"With none to comfort them. Maurine, sweet friend!"
3406,_PART VII._,"Be kind to them, and love them to the end,"
3407,_PART VII._,Which may not be far distant.
3408,_PART VII._,And I leave
3409,_PART VII._,"A soul immortal in your charge, Maurine."
3410,_PART VII._,"From this most holy, sad and sacred eve,"
3411,_PART VII._,"Till God shall claim her, she is yours to keep,"
3412,_PART VII._,"To love and shelter, to protect and guide."""
3413,_PART VII._,"She touched the slumb'ring cherub at her side,"
3414,_PART VII._,"And Vivian gently bore her, still asleep,"
3415,_PART VII._,And laid the precious burden on my breast.
3416,_PART VII._,
3417,_PART VII._,A solemn silence fell upon the scene.
3418,_PART VII._,"And when the sleeping infant smiled, and pressed"
3419,_PART VII._,"My yielding bosom with her waxen cheek,"
3420,_PART VII._,"I felt it would be sacrilege to speak,"
3421,_PART VII._,Such wordless joy possessed me.
3422,_PART VII._,Oh! at last
3423,_PART VII._,"This infant, who, in that tear-blotted past,"
3424,_PART VII._,"Had caused my soul such travail, was my own:"
3425,_PART VII._,Through all the lonely coming years to be
3426,_PART VII._,Mine own to cherish--wholly mine alone.
3427,_PART VII._,"And what I mourned, so hopelessly as lost"
3428,_PART VII._,"Was now restored, and given back to me."
3429,_PART VII._,
3430,_PART VII._,The dying voice continued:
3431,_PART VII._,"""In this child"
3432,_PART VII._,"You yet have me, whose mortal life she cost."
3433,_PART VII._,"But all that was most pure and undefiled,"
3434,_PART VII._,"And good within me, lives in her again."
3435,_PART VII._,"Maurine, my husband loves me; yet I know,"
3436,_PART VII._,"Moving about the wide world, to and fro,"
3437,_PART VII._,"And through, and in the busy haunts of men,"
3438,_PART VII._,"Not always will his heart be dumb with woe,"
3439,_PART VII._,But sometime waken to a later love.
3440,_PART VII._,"Nay, Vivian, hush! my soul has passed above"
3441,_PART VII._,All selfish feelings! I would have it so.
3442,_PART VII._,"While I am with the angels, blest and glad,"
3443,_PART VII._,"I would not have you sorrowing and sad,"
3444,_PART VII._,In loneliness go mourning to the end.
3445,_PART VII._,"But, love! I could not trust to any other"
3446,_PART VII._,The sacred office of a foster-mother
3447,_PART VII._,"To this sweet cherub, save my own heart-friend."
3448,_PART VII._,
3449,_PART VII._,"""Teach her to love her father's name, Maurine,"
3450,_PART VII._,Where'er he wanders. Keep my memory green
3451,_PART VII._,"In her young heart, and lead her in her youth,"
3452,_PART VII._,To drink from th' eternal fount of Truth;
3453,_PART VII._,"Vex her not with sectarian discourse,"
3454,_PART VII._,Nor strive to teach her piety by force;
3455,_PART VII._,"Ply not her mind with harsh and narrow creeds,"
3456,_PART VII._,"Nor frighten her with an avenging God,"
3457,_PART VII._,Who rules his subjects with a burning rod;
3458,_PART VII._,But teach her that each mortal simply needs
3459,_PART VII._,"To grow in hate of hate and love of love,"
3460,_PART VII._,To gain a kingdom in the courts above.
3461,_PART VII._,
3462,_PART VII._,"""Let her be free and natural as the flowers,"
3463,_PART VII._,That smile and nod throughout the summer hours.
3464,_PART VII._,"Let her rejoice in all the joys of youth,"
3465,_PART VII._,But first impress upon her mind this truth:
3466,_PART VII._,No lasting happiness is e'er attained
3467,_PART VII._,Save when the heart some _other_ seeks to please.
3468,_PART VII._,"The cup of selfish pleasures soon is drained,"
3469,_PART VII._,And full of gall and bitterness the lees.
3470,_PART VII._,"Next to her God, teach her to love her land;"
3471,_PART VII._,In her young bosom light the patriot's flame
3472,_PART VII._,Until the heart within her shall expand
3473,_PART VII._,With love and fervor at her country's name.
3474,_PART VII._,"""No coward-mother bears a valiant son."
3475,_PART VII._,"And this, my last wish, is an earnest one."
3476,_PART VII._,
3477,_PART VII._,"""Maurine, my o'er-taxed strength is waning; you"
3478,_PART VII._,"Have heard my wishes, and you will be true"
3479,_PART VII._,"In death as you have been in life, my own!"
3480,_PART VII._,Now leave me for a little while alone
3481,_PART VII._,With him--my husband. Dear love! I shall rest
3482,_PART VII._,So sweetly with no care upon my breast.
3483,_PART VII._,"Good night, Maurine, come to me in the morning."""
3484,_PART VII._,
3485,_PART VII._,But lo! the bridegroom with no further warning
3486,_PART VII._,Came for her at the dawning of the day.
3487,_PART VII._,"She heard his voice, and smiled, and passed away"
3488,_PART VII._,Without a struggle.
3489,_PART VII._,Leaning o'er her bed
3490,_PART VII._,"To give her greeting, I found but her clay,"
3491,_PART VII._,And Vivian bowed beside it.
3492,_PART VII._,
3493,_PART VII._,"And I said,"
3494,_PART VII._,"""Dear friend! my soul shall treasure thy request,"
3495,_PART VII._,And when the night of fever and unrest
3496,_PART VII._,"Melts in the morning of Eternity,"
3497,_PART VII._,"Like a freed bird, then I will come to thee."
3498,_PART VII._,
3499,_PART VII._,"""I will come to thee in the morning, sweet!"
3500,_PART VII._,I have been true; and soul with soul shall meet
3501,_PART VII._,"Before God's throne, and shall not be afraid."
3502,_PART VII._,"Thou gav'st me trust, and it was not betrayed."
3503,_PART VII._,
3504,_PART VII._,"""I will come to thee in the morning, dear!"
3505,_PART VII._,The night is dark. I do not know how near
3506,_PART VII._,The morn may be of that Eternal Day;
3507,_PART VII._,I can but keep my faithful watch and pray.
3508,_PART VII._,
3509,_PART VII._,"""I will come to thee in the morning, love!"
3510,_PART VII._,Wait for me on the Eternal Heights above.
3511,_PART VII._,"The way is troubled where my feet must climb,"
3512,_PART VII._,Ere I shall tread the mountain-top sublime.
3513,_PART VII._,
3514,_PART VII._,"""I will come in the morning, O, mine own!"
3515,_PART VII._,"But for a time must grope my way alone,"
3516,_PART VII._,"Through tears and sorrow, till the Day shall dawn,"
3517,_PART VII._,"And I shall hear the summons, and pass on."
3518,_PART VII._,
3519,_PART VII._,"""I will come in the morning. Rest secure!"
3520,_PART VII._,My hope is certain and my faith is sure.
3521,_PART VII._,After the gloom and darkness of the night
3522,_PART VII._,"I will come to thee with the morning light."""

3525,_PART VII._,
3526,_PART VII._,Three peaceful years slipped silently away.
3527,_PART VII._,
3528,_PART VII._,"We dwelt together in my childhood's home,"
3529,_PART VII._,"Aunt Ruth and I, and sunny-hearted May."
3530,_PART VII._,She was a fair and most exquisite child;
3531,_PART VII._,Her pensive face was delicate and mild
3532,_PART VII._,Like her dead mother's; but through her dear eyes
3533,_PART VII._,"Her father smiled upon me, day by day."
3534,_PART VII._,"Afar in foreign countries did he roam,"
3535,_PART VII._,"Now resting under Italy's blue skies,"
3536,_PART VII._,And now with Roy in Scotland.
3537,_PART VII._,And he sent
3538,_PART VII._,"Brief, friendly letters, telling where he went"
3539,_PART VII._,"And what he saw, addressed to May or me."
3540,_PART VII._,And I would write and tell him how she grew--
3541,_PART VII._,And how she talked about him o'er the sea
3542,_PART VII._,In her sweet baby fashion; how she knew
3543,_PART VII._,His picture in the album; how each day
3544,_PART VII._,She knelt and prayed the blessed Lord would bring
3545,_PART VII._,Her own papa back to his little May.
3546,_PART VII._,
3547,_PART VII._,It was a warm bright morning in the Spring.
3548,_PART VII._,"I sat in that same sunny portico,"
3549,_PART VII._,Where I was sitting seven years ago
3550,_PART VII._,"When Vivian came. My eyes were full of tears,"
3551,_PART VII._,As I looked back across the checkered years.
3552,_PART VII._,How many were the changes they had brought!
3553,_PART VII._,"Pain, death, and sorrow! but the lesson taught"
3554,_PART VII._,To my young heart had been of untold worth.
3555,_PART VII._,"I had learned how to ""suffer and grow strong""--"
3556,_PART VII._,"That knowledge which best serves us here on earth,"
3557,_PART VII._,And brings reward in Heaven.
3558,_PART VII._,
3559,_PART VII._,Oh! how long
3560,_PART VII._,The years had been since that June morning when
3561,_PART VII._,"I heard his step upon the walk, and yet"
3562,_PART VII._,I seemed to hear its echo still.
3563,_PART VII._,Just then
3564,_PART VII._,"Down that same path I turned my eyes, tear-wet,"
3565,_PART VII._,And lo! the wanderer from a foreign land
3566,_PART VII._,Stood there before me!--holding out his hand
3567,_PART VII._,And smiling with those wond'rous eyes of old.
3568,_PART VII._,
3569,_PART VII._,"To hide my tears, I ran and brought his child;"
3570,_PART VII._,"But she was shy, and clung to me, when told"
3571,_PART VII._,"This was papa, for whom her prayers were said."
3572,_PART VII._,"She dropped her eyes and shook her little head,"
3573,_PART VII._,"And would not by his coaxing be beguiled,"
3574,_PART VII._,Or go to him.
3575,_PART VII._,"Aunt Ruth was not at home,"
3576,_PART VII._,"And we two sat and talked, as strangers might,"
3577,_PART VII._,Of distant countries which we both had seen.
3578,_PART VII._,But once I thought I saw his large eyes light
3579,_PART VII._,"With sudden passion, when there came a pause"
3580,_PART VII._,"In our chit-chat, and then he spoke:"
3581,_PART VII._,"""Maurine,"
3582,_PART VII._,I saw a number of your friends in Rome.
3583,_PART VII._,"We talked of you. They seemed surprised, because"
3584,_PART VII._,You were not 'mong the seekers for a name.
3585,_PART VII._,"They thought your whole ambition was for fame."""
3586,_PART VII._,
3587,_PART VII._,"""It might have been,"" I answered, ""when my heart"
3588,_PART VII._,Had nothing else to fill it. Now my art
3589,_PART VII._,Is but a recreation. I have _this_
3590,_PART VII._,"To love and live for, which I had not then."""
3591,_PART VII._,"And, leaning down, I pressed a tender kiss"
3592,_PART VII._,Upon my child's fair brow.
3593,_PART VII._,
3594,_PART VII._,"""And yet,"" he said,"
3595,_PART VII._,"The old light leaping to his eyes again,"
3596,_PART VII._,"""And yet, Maurine, they say you might have wed"
3597,_PART VII._,A noble Baron! one of many men
3598,_PART VII._,Who laid their hearts and fortunes at your feet.
3599,_PART VII._,"Why won the bravest of them no return?"""
3600,_PART VII._,
3601,_PART VII._,"I bowed my head, nor dared his gaze to meet."
3602,_PART VII._,"On cheek and brow I felt the red blood burn,"
3603,_PART VII._,And strong emotion strangled speech.
3604,_PART VII._,He rose
3605,_PART VII._,And came and knelt beside me.
3606,_PART VII._,"""Sweet, my sweet!"""
3607,_PART VII._,"He murmured softly, ""God in Heaven knows"
3608,_PART VII._,How well I loved you seven years ago.
3609,_PART VII._,"He only knows my anguish, and my grief,"
3610,_PART VII._,When your own acts forced on me the belief
3611,_PART VII._,That I had been your plaything and your toy.
3612,_PART VII._,Yet from his lips I since have learned that Roy
3613,_PART VII._,Held no place nearer than a friend and brother.
3614,_PART VII._,"And then a faint suspicion, undefined,"
3615,_PART VII._,"Of what had been--was--might be, stirred my mind,"
3616,_PART VII._,"And that great love, I thought died at a blow,"
3617,_PART VII._,"Rose up within me, strong with hope and life."
3618,_PART VII._,
3619,_PART VII._,"""Before all heaven and the angel mother"
3620,_PART VII._,"Of this sweet child that slumbers on your heart,"
3621,_PART VII._,"Maurine, Maurine, I claim you for my wife--"
3622,_PART VII._,"Mine own, forever, until death shall part!"""
3623,_PART VII._,
3624,_PART VII._,"Through happy mists of upward welling tears,"
3625,_PART VII._,"I leaned, and looked into his beauteous eyes."
3626,_PART VII._,"""Dear heart,"" I said, ""if she who dwells above"
3627,_PART VII._,"Looks down upon us, from yon azure skies,"
3628,_PART VII._,"She can but bless us, knowing all these years"
3629,_PART VII._,My soul had yearned in silence for the love
3630,_PART VII._,"That crowned her life, and left mine own so bleak."
3631,_PART VII._,"I turned you from me for her fair, frail sake."
3632,_PART VII._,"For her sweet child's, and for my own, I take"
3633,_PART VII._,"You back to be all mine, for evermore."""
3634,_PART VII._,
3635,_PART VII._,Just then the child upon my breast awoke
3636,_PART VII._,"From her light sleep, and laid her downy cheek"
3637,_PART VII._,Against her father as he knelt by me.
3638,_PART VII._,And this unconscious action seemed to be
3639,_PART VII._,"A silent blessing, which the mother spoke"
3640,_PART VII._,Gazing upon us from the mystic shore.

3645,TWO SUNSETS.,
3646,TWO SUNSETS.,
3647,TWO SUNSETS.,"In the fair morning of his life,"
3648,TWO SUNSETS.,"When his pure heart lay in his breast,"
3649,TWO SUNSETS.,"Panting, with all that wild unrest"
3650,TWO SUNSETS.,To plunge into the great world's strife
3651,TWO SUNSETS.,
3652,TWO SUNSETS.,"That fills young hearts with mad desire,"
3653,TWO SUNSETS.,He saw a sunset. Red and gold
3654,TWO SUNSETS.,"The burning billows surged and rolled,"
3655,TWO SUNSETS.,And upward tossed their caps of fire.
3656,TWO SUNSETS.,
3657,TWO SUNSETS.,"He looked. And as he looked, the sight"
3658,TWO SUNSETS.,Sent from his soul through breast and brain
3659,TWO SUNSETS.,"Such intense joy, it hurt like pain."
3660,TWO SUNSETS.,His heart seemed bursting with delight.
3661,TWO SUNSETS.,
3662,TWO SUNSETS.,"So near the Unknown seemed, so close"
3663,TWO SUNSETS.,He might have grasped it with his hand.
3664,TWO SUNSETS.,"He felt his inmost soul expand,"
3665,TWO SUNSETS.,As sunlight will expand a rose.
3666,TWO SUNSETS.,
3667,TWO SUNSETS.,One day he heard a singing strain--
3668,TWO SUNSETS.,"A human voice, in bird-like trills."
3669,TWO SUNSETS.,"He paused, and little rapture-rills"
3670,TWO SUNSETS.,Went trickling downward through each vein.
3671,TWO SUNSETS.,
3672,TWO SUNSETS.,"And in his heart the whole day long,"
3673,TWO SUNSETS.,"As in a temple veiled and dim,"
3674,TWO SUNSETS.,He kept and bore about with him
3675,TWO SUNSETS.,The beauty of that singer's song.
3676,TWO SUNSETS.,
3677,TWO SUNSETS.,And then? But why relate what then?
3678,TWO SUNSETS.,His smouldering heart flamed into fire--
3679,TWO SUNSETS.,He had his one supreme desire.
3680,TWO SUNSETS.,And plunged into the world of men.
3681,TWO SUNSETS.,
3682,TWO SUNSETS.,For years queen Folly held her sway.
3683,TWO SUNSETS.,With pleasures of the grosser kind
3684,TWO SUNSETS.,"She fed his flesh and drugged his mind,"
3685,TWO SUNSETS.,"Till, shamed, he sated turned away."
3686,TWO SUNSETS.,
3687,TWO SUNSETS.,He sought his boyhood's home. That hour
3688,TWO SUNSETS.,"Triumphant should have been, in sooth,"
3689,TWO SUNSETS.,"Since he went forth an unknown youth,"
3690,TWO SUNSETS.,And came back crowned with wealth and power.
3691,TWO SUNSETS.,
3692,TWO SUNSETS.,The clouds made day a gorgeous bed;
3693,TWO SUNSETS.,He saw the splendor of the sky
3694,TWO SUNSETS.,With unmoved heart and stolid eye;
3695,TWO SUNSETS.,He only knew the West was red.
3696,TWO SUNSETS.,
3697,TWO SUNSETS.,Then suddenly a fresh young voice
3698,TWO SUNSETS.,"Rose, bird-like, from some hidden place,"
3699,TWO SUNSETS.,He did not even turn his face;
3700,TWO SUNSETS.,It struck him simply as a noise.
3701,TWO SUNSETS.,
3702,TWO SUNSETS.,He trod the old paths up and down.
3703,TWO SUNSETS.,Their rich-hued leaves by Fall winds whirled--
3704,TWO SUNSETS.,How dull they were--how dull the world--
3705,TWO SUNSETS.,Dull even in the pulsing town.
3706,TWO SUNSETS.,
3707,TWO SUNSETS.,"O! worst of punishments, that brings"
3708,TWO SUNSETS.,"A blunting of all finer sense,"
3709,TWO SUNSETS.,"A loss of feelings keen, intense,"
3710,TWO SUNSETS.,And dulls us to the higher things.

3712,TWO SUNSETS.,"O! penalty most dire, most sure,"
3713,TWO SUNSETS.,"Swift following after gross delights,"
3714,TWO SUNSETS.,"That we no more see beauteous sights,"

3717,TWO SUNSETS.,O! shape more hideous and more dread

3719,TWO SUNSETS.,"This certain doom that blunts and blinds,"
3720,TWO SUNSETS.,And strikes the holiest feelings dead.

4672,HELENA.,Last night I saw Helena. She whose praise
4673,HELENA.,Of late all men have sounded. She for whom
4674,HELENA.,Young Angus rashly sought a silent tomb
4675,HELENA.,Rather than live without her all his days.
4676,HELENA.,
4677,HELENA.,"Wise men go mad who look upon her long,"
4678,HELENA.,She is so ripe with dangers. Yet meanwhile
4679,HELENA.,"I find no fascination in her smile,"
4680,HELENA.,Although I make her theme of this poor song.
4681,HELENA.,
4682,HELENA.,"""Her golden tresses?"" yes, they may be fair,"
4683,HELENA.,And yet to me each shining silken tress
4684,HELENA.,Seems robbed of beauty and all lusterless--
4685,HELENA.,Too many hands have stroked Helena's hair.
4686,HELENA.,
4687,HELENA.,(I know a little maiden so demure
4688,HELENA.,She will not let her one true lover's hands

4692,HELENA.,"""Her great dark eyes that flash like gems at night?"

4694,HELENA.,And yet they are not beautiful to me.
4695,HELENA.,Too many hearts have sunned in their delight.
4696,HELENA.,
4697,HELENA.,"(I mind me of two tender blue eyes, hid"
4698,HELENA.,"So underneath white curtains, and so veiled"
4699,HELENA.,"That I have sometimes plead for hours, and failed"
4700,HELENA.,To see more than the shyly lifted lid.)
4701,HELENA.,
4702,HELENA.,"""Her perfect mouth so like a carvèd kiss?"""
4703,HELENA.,"""Her honeyed mouth, where hearts do, fly-like, drown?"""
4704,HELENA.,I would not taste its sweetness for a crown;
4705,HELENA.,Too many lips have drank its nectared bliss.
4706,HELENA.,
4707,HELENA.,"(I know a mouth whose virgin dew, undried,"
4708,HELENA.,"Lies like a young grape's bloom, untouched and sweet,"
4709,HELENA.,"And though I plead in passion at her feet,"
4710,HELENA.,She would not let me brush it if I died.)
4711,HELENA.,
4712,HELENA.,"In vain, Helena! though wise men may vie"
4713,HELENA.,"For thy rare smile or die from loss of it,"
