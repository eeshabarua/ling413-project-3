152,DUANDON,
153,DUANDON,"Duandon, king of Aetria’s farthest bound"
154,DUANDON,"And lord of isles the sea is loud around,"
155,DUANDON,Beheld the crimson fountains of the dawn
156,DUANDON,"Bear up the lark, a foam of song, till drawn"
157,DUANDON,"By some new sorrow in the ocean’s tone,"
158,DUANDON,"Thither he fared, expectant and alone."
159,DUANDON,"Thither he fared, fresh from the sea of sleep,"
160,DUANDON,"And all the balmy land was blossomed deep,"
161,DUANDON,"Nor could one wander save on helpless flow’rs,"
162,DUANDON,Where Summer made a garland of the hours
163,DUANDON,"And bound it on the dew-dipt brow of Morn,"
164,DUANDON,Bent low above the meadow’s blossom-bourn.
165,DUANDON,But past all peace of bowers rang the call
166,DUANDON,"And invocation of the billows’ fall,"
167,DUANDON,"And, clean from kingdoms of the sapphire vast,"
168,DUANDON,The winds of ocean smote his brow at last.
169,DUANDON,Afar he saw the eddying petrel sweep
170,DUANDON,"O’er reefs where hoarser roared the thwarted deep,"
171,DUANDON,"And soon before his eyes, exultant, fain,"
172,DUANDON,"Heavy with azure gleamed the investing main,"
173,DUANDON,"And quick with pulsings of a distant storm,"
174,DUANDON,Strong as that music floating Troy to form.
175,DUANDON,Splendid the everlasting ocean shone
176,DUANDON,As God’s blue robe upon a desert thrown;
177,DUANDON,"Landward he saw the sea-born breakers fare,"
178,DUANDON,Young as a wind and ancient as the air;
179,DUANDON,"August he saw the unending ranks uproll,"
180,DUANDON,"With joy and wonder mastering the soul,"
181,DUANDON,With marvel on the hearing and the sight--
182,DUANDON,"Green fires, and billows tremulous with light,"
183,DUANDON,With shaken soul of light and shuddering blaze
184,DUANDON,"Of leaping emerald and cold chrysoprase,--"
185,DUANDON,"The surge and suspiration of the sea,"
186,DUANDON,"Great waters choral of eternity,--"
187,DUANDON,The mighty dirge that will not cease for day
188,DUANDON,"Nor all the stars’ invincible array,--"
189,DUANDON,"The thunder that hath set, since Time began,"
190,DUANDON,Its sorrow in the lonely heart of man.
191,DUANDON,
192,DUANDON,"Long stood the king before that wide review,"
193,DUANDON,"Divining, deep beyond its sound and hue,"
194,DUANDON,"Unfathomable mystery and dream,--"
195,DUANDON,Rapture and woe illusive but supreme;
196,DUANDON,"And as the pine against the sea-wind sighs,"
197,DUANDON,So thrilled his breast with whispers and surmise;
198,DUANDON,"Till, on a beach that only he might roam,"
199,DUANDON,"The sea, from broadest tapestries of foam,"
200,DUANDON,"From mighty looms immaculate and cold,"
201,DUANDON,A scarlet shell before his feet uprolled.
202,DUANDON,"Wet as with blood against the dawn it flamed,"
203,DUANDON,"Deep-whorled and irised, lustrous and unnamed--"
204,DUANDON,A jewel of the sea that burned and shone
205,DUANDON,Like some king-ruby ravished from a throne.
206,DUANDON,"And long Duandon wandered, all-amazed,"
207,DUANDON,"And long upon the shell’s wild beauty gazed,"
208,DUANDON,"Till, half-unwitting, swiftly to his ear"
209,DUANDON,"He held it, fain as any child to hear"
210,DUANDON,That echo like the murmuring of seas--
211,DUANDON,Astray forever on a mournful breeze
212,DUANDON,"And borne from some remote, nocturnal bound;"
213,DUANDON,"Whereat a voice, in sorceries of sound"
214,DUANDON,"To which the grace of vanished lyres had clung,"
215,DUANDON,Sang from the shell as never voice hath sung:
216,DUANDON,
217,DUANDON,"_Far down, where virgin silence reigns,"
218,DUANDON,"In jasper evenings of the sea,"
219,DUANDON,"I toss my pearls, I wait for thee."
220,DUANDON,The sea hath lent me all its stains:
221,DUANDON,It is but treasure-house of me._
222,DUANDON,
223,DUANDON,_The corals of the deep have caught
224,DUANDON,A Titan shell whose fragile dome_
225,DUANDON,_Is crimson o’er mine ocean home--
226,DUANDON,Mine opal chambers subtly wrought
227,DUANDON,In semblance of the shaken foam._
228,DUANDON,
229,DUANDON,"_Oh, come! and thou shalt dream with me"
230,DUANDON,By violet foam at twilight tost
231,DUANDON,On strands of ocean islets lost
232,DUANDON,"To prows that seek them wearily,"
233,DUANDON,O’er seas by questing sunsets crost._
234,DUANDON,
235,DUANDON,"_All dreams that Hope hath promised Love,"
236,DUANDON,"All beauty thou hast sought in vain,"
237,DUANDON,"All joy held once and lost again,"
238,DUANDON,"These, and the mystery thereof,"
239,DUANDON,I guard beneath the sundering main._
240,DUANDON,
241,DUANDON,"So rang that crystal cry, as from afar,"
242,DUANDON,"Clear as the voice of Heaven’s whitest star,"
243,DUANDON,"And strong Duandon pondered, with his gaze"
244,DUANDON,Set like twin stars above those azure ways.
245,DUANDON,"Keener his heart, a plummet, yearned to sound"
246,DUANDON,"The gulf that held his soul amazed and bound,"
247,DUANDON,"Where, darker for the sky’s unclouded dome,"
248,DUANDON,"The waves took sudden coronals of foam,"
249,DUANDON,"Till half he deemed he saw, far out, the white"
250,DUANDON,Flung arms and bosom of the ocean-sprite.
251,DUANDON,"Hour beyond hour, until the sun was fled,"
252,DUANDON,Strode he on sands that none but he might tread;
253,DUANDON,Hour beyond hour one sight his vision drank--
254,DUANDON,"A foam-white arm that beckoned once, and sank."
255,DUANDON,"Then, wave to wave in deeper anthems roared,"
256,DUANDON,"And realm by realm the belted sunset soared,"
257,DUANDON,As tho’ a city of the Titans burned
258,DUANDON,"In lands below the sea-line, undiscerned,"
259,DUANDON,"Till desolation touched it, zone by zone,"
260,DUANDON,"Its splendors gone, like jewels turned to stone,"
261,DUANDON,"And sad with evening sang the ocean-choirs,"
262,DUANDON,Domed by the stars’ imperishable fires.
263,DUANDON,But still Duandon lingered on the sands
264,DUANDON,And clasped the shell with indecisive hands;
265,DUANDON,"Ghostly it gleamed, nor music would outpour"
266,DUANDON,Save of the sea on some disastrous shore.
267,DUANDON,"And still he stood, and listened but to hark"
268,DUANDON,"The surf, like dragons battling in the dark;"
269,DUANDON,"Implacable they ravened, ere the moon,"
270,DUANDON,"A towering glory on the eastern dune,"
271,DUANDON,"A frozen splendor on the seething strand,"
272,DUANDON,In silver webs had snared the sea and land.
273,DUANDON,"Then, as on hostile waves her arrows leapt,"
274,DUANDON,"Duandon turned him from the sea, and slept."
275,DUANDON,"Slept, but the morning found him yet again"
276,DUANDON,A lonely searcher of the lonelier main;
277,DUANDON,"And night by night, and day by barren day,"
278,DUANDON,Silent he stood before the waves’ array--
279,DUANDON,The victim of an unrelenting strife
280,DUANDON,"Of joy with death, of love with love of life."
281,DUANDON,Ever at dawn the voice from out the shell
282,DUANDON,Renewed within his heart the siren’s spell;
283,DUANDON,"Ever the wild, enchanting melody"
284,DUANDON,Rang as the sun was wedded to the sea.
285,DUANDON,And still the royal pageant of the world
286,DUANDON,"Before his doom-bewildered eyes unfurled,"
287,DUANDON,With dusky stain of sunsets northward drawn
288,DUANDON,And cloudy headlands of the coasts of dawn.
289,DUANDON,"Beyond that realm of jade and jade-bound bays,"
290,DUANDON,He saw the sapphire fields of ocean blaze;
291,DUANDON,Heard the alliant waters chant their rune
292,DUANDON,"Before the turquoise battlements of noon,"
293,DUANDON,Where evening armies of the mist would roam
294,DUANDON,"As twilight mixed its purple with the foam,--"
295,DUANDON,"Where sunlight, checked in its torrential leap,"
296,DUANDON,Would froth at dawn about some cloudland steep.
297,DUANDON,"Debarred was peace, tho’ Sleep, with tender hand,"
298,DUANDON,Led him awhile in her allaying land;
299,DUANDON,For soon the sea flowed in upon his dream
300,DUANDON,And far below he saw the Singer gleam--
301,DUANDON,"Her floating hair and pearly body’s grace,"
302,DUANDON,With sunken moonlight pure upon her face.
303,DUANDON,"So still he yearned, on whom her spell was laid,"
304,DUANDON,"And ever sunset, like a golden blade,"
305,DUANDON,"Cut day by day from life, and ever he"
306,DUANDON,"Heard like the voice of Death the lordly sea,"
307,DUANDON,"Chanting, enthroned on choric reef and bars,"
308,DUANDON,"Its midnight song below the western stars,"
309,DUANDON,And all the stars seemed ministrant to doom
310,DUANDON,As high Orion trod his arc of gloom.
311,DUANDON,
312,DUANDON,Broke then a morning when the weary sea
313,DUANDON,Lay husht above its halls of mystery;
314,DUANDON,"Besieging fog hung mute on shore and vale,"
315,DUANDON,"With pallid banners and with ashen mail,"
316,DUANDON,"And ocean, grey as with oblivion,"
317,DUANDON,Lay hidden from the visage of the sun.
318,DUANDON,"High noon drave not the phantom army forth,"
319,DUANDON,"Nor winds slow-seeping from the muffled North,"
320,DUANDON,"And weary with its vigil of the deep,"
321,DUANDON,Duandon’s soul put out on seas of sleep;
322,DUANDON,"Dreamless he lay ere sunset, and the shell,"
323,DUANDON,"Unguarded, from assenting fingers fell."
324,DUANDON,"Came then, nor spilt that anodyne of rest,"
325,DUANDON,"His only son, impatient with the quest,"
326,DUANDON,"New-fared from crimson victories of war,--"
327,DUANDON,Tall as the spears that lesser champions bore.
328,DUANDON,To him the horizon was a smitten chord
329,DUANDON,"That rang in challenge to his youthful sword,"
330,DUANDON,And thrilled with all the murmurs of romance
331,DUANDON,The realms remote from his insatiate lance.
332,DUANDON,"Silent awhile he stood, and ere he spoke,"
333,DUANDON,"Routed at last, the sea-mist’s army broke,"
334,DUANDON,"And, as its ranks fled landward to their knell,"
335,DUANDON,The consummating sunset smote the shell....
336,DUANDON,
337,DUANDON,"Duandon woke below the evening star,"
338,DUANDON,And saw the foam’s incessant scimetar
339,DUANDON,"Leap from the billow’s sheath, and heard the cry"
340,DUANDON,Of winds unleashed upon the western sky;
341,DUANDON,Forlorn beyond the darkling waters lay
342,DUANDON,The sullen embers of the pyre of Day--
343,DUANDON,"Dull, ere obscuring night should make the sea"
344,DUANDON,One with the reaches of infinity;
345,DUANDON,"Then to the sands his gaze returned, to meet"
346,DUANDON,The seaward print of unreturning feet.
347,DUANDON,"Gone was the shell; a sword lay in its stead,"
348,DUANDON,From altars of the buried sun made red--
349,DUANDON,A blade he knew so well from all the rest
350,DUANDON,It seemed that instant to transfix his breast.
351,DUANDON,"Afar or near, on waters grey and lone,"
352,DUANDON,"No swimmer drave, no arm uplifted shone;"
353,DUANDON,"Austere and vacant rolled the cryptic main,"
354,DUANDON,"Unsearchable: the prince came not again,"
355,DUANDON,"Unseen on tawny beach or waters loud,--"
356,DUANDON,Gone like the shadow of a vanished cloud.
357,DUANDON,
358,DUANDON,"Aye! better vanished, than to wait, as he,"
359,DUANDON,"Duandon, silent by the unmastered sea,"
360,DUANDON,"From which, till death, his heart was doomed to crave"
361,DUANDON,The uncomprehended tidings of the wave--
362,DUANDON,An echo of that music from the shell
363,DUANDON,Forever vibrant in its fall and swell--
364,DUANDON,"Was fated, still, from azure gulfs to dream"
365,DUANDON,"He saw the arm of some white swimmer gleam,"
366,DUANDON,Flung for an instant from the shifting spray--
367,DUANDON,"Siren, or son, or both, he could not say."
368,DUANDON,"And feelest _thou_ no pangs of beauty lost,"
369,DUANDON,When morning waves or waters sunset-crost
370,DUANDON,"Cry to thy soul, unsatisfied, alone,"
371,DUANDON,Of Isles to which its younger dreams have flown?
372,DUANDON,"The might-have-been, the nevermore-to-be,"
373,DUANDON,Bears not the deep their antiphon to thee?
374,DUANDON,"For man has found, as man shall ever find,"
375,DUANDON,"Some echo of his travail on the wind,"
376,DUANDON,"And sigh of great Departures, and the breath"
377,DUANDON,Of pinions incontestable by Death.
378,DUANDON,Of stars and shadows past to-morrow’s ken
379,DUANDON,"He finds him vision and announcement, when,"
380,DUANDON,As storms beyond the horizon-line prolong
381,DUANDON,"The sea’s imperious, eternal song,"
382,DUANDON,The thunder-chorded surf on yellow sands
383,DUANDON,"Resounds, like harps on which the gods lay hands."

481,THE EVANESCENT,The centuries that foster thee!”
482,THE EVANESCENT,
483,THE EVANESCENT,Ere died the wind the tree had said:
484,THE EVANESCENT,"“O mountain marvellous and strong,"
485,THE EVANESCENT,"The aeons of thine age--how long,"
486,THE EVANESCENT,When I and all my kin lie dead!”
487,THE EVANESCENT,
488,THE EVANESCENT,The mountain spake: “O sea! thy strength
489,THE EVANESCENT,Forevermore I shall not face.
490,THE EVANESCENT,At last I sink to thine embrace;
491,THE EVANESCENT,Thy waves await my ramparts’ length.”
492,THE EVANESCENT,
493,THE EVANESCENT,The deep gave moan: “O stars supreme!
494,THE EVANESCENT,Your eyes shall see me mute in death.
495,THE EVANESCENT,Before your gaze I fade like breath
496,THE EVANESCENT,Of vapors in a mortal’s dream.”
497,THE EVANESCENT,
498,THE EVANESCENT,"Then bore the Void a choral cry,"
499,THE EVANESCENT,Descendent from the starry throng:
500,THE EVANESCENT,"“A little, and our ancient song"
501,THE EVANESCENT,"Dies at thy throne, Eternity!”"
502,THE EVANESCENT,
503,THE EVANESCENT,"Then, silence on the heavenly Deep,"
504,THE EVANESCENT,"Wherein that music sank unheard,"
505,THE EVANESCENT,As shuts the midnight on a word
506,THE EVANESCENT,Said by a dreamer in his sleep.

578,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,
579,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Dedicated to Mrs. Joseph B. Coryell
580,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,
581,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,
582,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,How swift a step from zone to zone!
583,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"A moment since, the day"
584,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Was cool with winds from linden-bowers flown
585,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,And breath of mounded hay
586,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"That ripens on the plains,"
587,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Beneath the shadow of the western hill;
588,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"But here the air is still,"
589,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Warm as a Lesbian valley’s afternoon
590,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Made langourous with June
591,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"And moist with spirits of unnumbered rains,"
592,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Pervaded with a perfume that might be
593,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Of rainbow-haunted lands beyond the sea
594,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,And ocean-ending sands--
595,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,A ghost of fragrance whose elusive hands
596,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Touch not the hidden harp of memory.
597,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,What sprites are those that gleam?
598,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Can eyes betray?
599,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Till now I did not deem
600,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,That Beauty’s flaming hands could shape in bloom
601,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,So marvelous and delicate designs.
602,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,The vision here that shines
603,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Seems not a fabric of our mortal day
604,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"And Nature’s tireless loom,"
605,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"By custom long defiled,"
606,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"But symbol of a loveliness supreme,"
607,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,A god’s forgotten dream
608,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,In alabaster told by elfin skill
609,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"In caverns underneath a haunted hill,"
610,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Or in some palace of enchantment hewn
611,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"From crystal in the twilights of the moon,"
612,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Where white Astarte strays
613,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,And Echo and the silver-footed fays
614,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Make alien music, fugitive and wild."
615,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Ye seem as flowers exiled,"
616,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,More beautiful because they die so soon;
617,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,But who the gods that could have scorned
618,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Your tenderness unmarred?
619,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Put first ye forth your fragile wings,"
620,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Less of the form than of the soul of things,"
621,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Where seraphim had mourned
622,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"In Eden’s evening, heavy-starred,"
623,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,When first the gates were barred
624,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,And cruel Time began?
625,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"For mystery hath lordship here, and ye"
626,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Seem spirit-flowers born to startle man
627,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,With intimations of eternity
628,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,And hint of what the flowers of Heaven may be.
629,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Nor can your glamour greatly seem of earth:
630,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Her blossoms are of mirth,"
631,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,But ye with loveliness can tell of grief--
632,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Unhappy love most exquisite and brief.
633,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,
634,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Wingéd ye seem and fleet,"
635,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Such flowers pale as are
636,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Worn by the goddess of a distant star--
637,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Before whose holy eyes
638,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Beauty and evening meet,"
639,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Mysterious beauty delicate and strange,"
640,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,And evening-calm that sighs
641,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,With Music’s inexpressible surmise--
642,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Her question ere she dies.
643,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"From form to form ye range,"
644,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"From hue to hue,"
645,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"And this, with petals wan and mystical,"
646,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Seems votive to those spirits of the dew
647,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"That weep at silvern twilights silently,"
648,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,With tears that gently fall
649,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,On hidden elves dim-curtained by the rose.
650,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"And thou, thy chalice better glows"
651,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,In purple grottos where the stainless sea
652,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,On sands inviolable swirls--
653,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"On evanescent pearls,"
654,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,That hold not all thy bosom’s purity.
655,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,
656,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"And thou, more white"
657,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Than when on some blue lake,"
658,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Just as the zephyrs wake,"
659,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,The ripples flash to light--
660,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Touched by a swan’s unsullied breast to foam,"
661,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Hadst thou in melancholy halls thy home?
662,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"For long ago thou seemest to have slept,"
663,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Forlorn, in palace-glooms where queens have wept."
664,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Ah! they too slept at last,"
665,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Whose sighs are half the music of the Past!
666,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,
667,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"But thou, O palest one!"
668,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Dost seem to scorn the sun,"
669,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"And, in a tropic, dense,"
670,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Languid magnificence,"
671,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Desire to know thy former place,"
672,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Where no man comes at night,"
673,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,And in its antic flight
674,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Behold the vampire-bat veer off from thee
675,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"As from a phantom face,"
676,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Or watch Antares’ light peer craftily
677,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Down from the dank and moonless sky,"
678,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,As goblins’ eyes might gleam
679,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Or baleful rubies glare,"
680,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Muffled in smoke or incense-laden air.
681,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"And thou, most weird companion, thou dost seem"
682,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Some mottled moth of Hell,"
683,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,That stealthily might fly
684,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,To hover there above the carnal bell
685,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Of some black lily, still and venomous,"
686,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,And poise forever thus.
687,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,
688,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Chill, in thy drowsy aether warm,"
689,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Softly thou gleamest, subtler form;"
690,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Witch-bloom thou seem’st to be,"
691,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,For Lilith would have bound thee in her hair--
692,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Smiling at dusk inscrutably,"
693,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"And Circe gathered such for gods to wear,"
694,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"In evenings when the moon,"
695,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,A sorceress who steals in white
696,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Along the cloudy parapets of night,"
697,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,In every glade her ghostly pearl hath strewn.
698,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Thou art as violet-wan
699,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,As eyelids of a vestal dead and meek.
700,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"If after-life can come to blossoms gone,"
701,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Surely Persephone
702,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Shall crown her brow with thee,"
703,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,In realms where burns nor star nor sun
704,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,To show the dead what amaranths to seek.
705,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,And ah--this other! none
706,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Of all thy kin more purely is arrayed--
707,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Pallid as Aphrodite’s cheek
708,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"To some long passion-swoon betrayed,"
709,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,By ecstasy foretold;
710,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Yet as with blood thy bosom gleams;
711,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Red as Adonis’ wound it seems,"
712,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"By Syria mourned of old,"
713,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Or scarlet lips that drink from bowls of jade,"
714,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Slowly, an ivory poison, sweet and cold...."
715,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,
716,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Oh! mystically strange
717,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"That speechless things should so have power to hint,"
718,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,With subtle form and tint
719,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"That seize the heart’s high memories unaware,"
720,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"The sorrow and the mystery of Change,"
721,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,And elements in Fate’s controlling plan
722,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Not altogether ministrant to man
723,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Nor mindful of his care--
724,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Some joy to death akin,"
725,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Or tragic kiss, or fruit malignly fair,"
726,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Some garden built by Sin
727,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"For Love to wander in,"
728,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Some face whose beauty bids the heart despair!
729,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"And yet, O blossoms pure!"
730,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,How marvelous the lure
731,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Of your fragility and innocence--
732,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,This grace and wistfulness of helpless things
733,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,That ask no recompense!
734,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Ye give the spirit wings,"
735,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"For yours the beauty that is near to pain,"
736,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,And stir the heart again
737,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,With visions of the Flowers that abide--
738,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,Ah! sweet
739,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,As when love’s glances meet
740,THE HOUSE OF ORCHIDS,"Across the music, heard at eventide!"

919,THE APOTHECARY’S,Draw back from doom the half-reluctant flesh.
920,THE APOTHECARY’S,"There beck the traitor joys to him who buys,"
921,THE APOTHECARY’S,And Death sits panoplied in gorgeous guise.
922,THE APOTHECARY’S,
923,THE APOTHECARY’S,"The dusts of hell, the dews of heavenly sods,"
924,THE APOTHECARY’S,"Water of Lethe or the wine of gods,"
925,THE APOTHECARY’S,"Purchase who will, but, ere his task begin,"
926,THE APOTHECARY’S,Beware the service that you set the djinn!
927,THE APOTHECARY’S,"Each hath his mercy, each his certain law,"
928,THE APOTHECARY’S,And each his Lord behind the veil of awe;
929,THE APOTHECARY’S,"But ponder well the ministry you crave,"

931,THE APOTHECARY’S,"Each hath a price, and each a tribute gives"
932,THE APOTHECARY’S,To him who turns from life and him who lives.
933,THE APOTHECARY’S,"If so you win from Pain a swift release,"
934,THE APOTHECARY’S,His face shall haunt you in the house of Peace;
935,THE APOTHECARY’S,"If so from Pain you scorn an anodyne,"

937,THE APOTHECARY’S,"Tho’ toil and time be now by them surpast,"
938,THE APOTHECARY’S,Exact the recompense they take at last--
939,THE APOTHECARY’S,"These genii of the vials, wreaking still"
940,THE APOTHECARY’S,Their sorceries on human sense and will.

945,THE SWIMMERS,THE SWIMMERS
946,THE SWIMMERS,
947,THE SWIMMERS,
948,THE SWIMMERS,"We were eight fishers of the western sea,"
949,THE SWIMMERS,"Who sailed our craft beside a barren land,"
950,THE SWIMMERS,Where harsh with pines the herdless mountains stand
951,THE SWIMMERS,And lonely beaches be.
952,THE SWIMMERS,
953,THE SWIMMERS,"There no man dwells, and ships go seldom past;"
954,THE SWIMMERS,"Yet sometimes there we lift our keels ashore,"
955,THE SWIMMERS,To rest in safety ’mid the broken roar
956,THE SWIMMERS,And mist of surges vast.
957,THE SWIMMERS,
958,THE SWIMMERS,"One strand we know, remote from all the rest,"
959,THE SWIMMERS,"For north and south the cliffs are high and steep,"
960,THE SWIMMERS,"Whose naked leagues of rock repel the deep,"
961,THE SWIMMERS,Insurgent from the west.
962,THE SWIMMERS,
963,THE SWIMMERS,"Tawny it lies, untrodden e’er by man,"
964,THE SWIMMERS,Save when from storm we sought its narrow rift
965,THE SWIMMERS,To beach our craft and light a fire of drift
966,THE SWIMMERS,And sleep till day began.
967,THE SWIMMERS,
968,THE SWIMMERS,Along its sands no flower nor bird has home.
969,THE SWIMMERS,"Abrupt its breast, girt by no splendor save"
970,THE SWIMMERS,The whorled and curving emerald of the wave
971,THE SWIMMERS,And scarves of rustling foam--
972,THE SWIMMERS,
973,THE SWIMMERS,"A place of solemn beauty; yet we swore,"
974,THE SWIMMERS,"By all the ocean stars’ unhasting flight,"
975,THE SWIMMERS,To seek no refuge for another night
976,THE SWIMMERS,Upon that haunted shore.
977,THE SWIMMERS,
978,THE SWIMMERS,That year a sombre autumn held the earth.
979,THE SWIMMERS,At dawn we sailed from out our village bay;
980,THE SWIMMERS,We sang; a taut wind leapt along the day;
981,THE SWIMMERS,The sea-birds mocked our mirth.
982,THE SWIMMERS,
983,THE SWIMMERS,"Southwest we drave, like arrows to a mark;"
984,THE SWIMMERS,"Ere set of sun the coast was far to lee,"
985,THE SWIMMERS,Where thundered over by the white-hooved sea
986,THE SWIMMERS,The reefs lie gaunt and dark.
987,THE SWIMMERS,
988,THE SWIMMERS,"But when we would have cast our hooks, the main"
989,THE SWIMMERS,"Grew wroth a-sudden, and our captains said:"
990,THE SWIMMERS,“Seek we a shelter.” And the west was red;
991,THE SWIMMERS,God gave his winds the rein.
992,THE SWIMMERS,
993,THE SWIMMERS,And eastward lay the sands of which I told;
994,THE SWIMMERS,"Thither we fled, and on the narrow beach"
995,THE SWIMMERS,Drew up our keels beyond the lessening reach
996,THE SWIMMERS,Of waters green and cold.
997,THE SWIMMERS,
998,THE SWIMMERS,Then set the wounded sun. The wind blew clean
999,THE SWIMMERS,The skies. A wincing star came forth at last.
1000,THE SWIMMERS,We heard like mighty tollings on the blast
1001,THE SWIMMERS,The shock of waves unseen.
1002,THE SWIMMERS,
1003,THE SWIMMERS,The wide-winged Eagle hovered overhead;
1004,THE SWIMMERS,The Scorpion crept slowly in the south
1005,THE SWIMMERS,To pits below the horizon; in its mouth
1006,THE SWIMMERS,Lay a young moon that bled.
1007,THE SWIMMERS,
1008,THE SWIMMERS,"And from our fire the ravished flame swept back,"
1009,THE SWIMMERS,"Like yellow hair of one who flies apace,"
1010,THE SWIMMERS,Compelled in lands barbarian to race
1011,THE SWIMMERS,With lions on her track.
1012,THE SWIMMERS,
1013,THE SWIMMERS,Then from the maelstroms of the surf arose
1014,THE SWIMMERS,"Wild laughter, mystical, and up the sands"
1015,THE SWIMMERS,Came Two that walked with intertwining hands
1016,THE SWIMMERS,Amid those ocean snows.
1017,THE SWIMMERS,
1018,THE SWIMMERS,Ghostly they shone before the lofty spray--
1019,THE SWIMMERS,"Fairer than gods and naked as the moon,"
1020,THE SWIMMERS,The foamy fillets at their ankles strewn
1021,THE SWIMMERS,Less marble-white than they.
1022,THE SWIMMERS,
1023,THE SWIMMERS,"Laughing they stood, then to our beacon’s glare"
1024,THE SWIMMERS,"Drew nearer, as we watched in mad surprise"
1025,THE SWIMMERS,"The scarlet-flashing lips, the sea-green eyes,"
1026,THE SWIMMERS,The red and tangled hair.
1027,THE SWIMMERS,
1028,THE SWIMMERS,"Then spoke the god (goddess and god they seemed),"
1029,THE SWIMMERS,In harplike accents of a tongue unknown--
1030,THE SWIMMERS,About his brows the dripping locks were blown;
1031,THE SWIMMERS,Like wannest gold he gleamed.
1032,THE SWIMMERS,
1033,THE SWIMMERS,Staring we sat; again the Vision spoke.
1034,THE SWIMMERS,"Beyond his form we saw the billows rave,--"
1035,THE SWIMMERS,"The leap of those white leopards in the wave,--"
1036,THE SWIMMERS,The spume of seas that broke.
1037,THE SWIMMERS,
1038,THE SWIMMERS,"Yet sat we mute, for then a human word"
1039,THE SWIMMERS,Seemed folly’s worst. And scorn began to trace
1040,THE SWIMMERS,"Its presence on the wild, imperious face;"
1041,THE SWIMMERS,"Again the red lips stirred,"
1042,THE SWIMMERS,
1043,THE SWIMMERS,But spoke not. In an instant we were free
1044,THE SWIMMERS,From that enchantment: fleet as deer they turned
1045,THE SWIMMERS,And sudden amber leapt the sands they spurned.
1046,THE SWIMMERS,We saw them meet the sea.
1047,THE SWIMMERS,
1048,THE SWIMMERS,"We heard the seven-chorded surf, unquelled,"
1049,THE SWIMMERS,Call in one thunder to the granite walls;
1050,THE SWIMMERS,"But over all, like broken clarion-calls,"
1051,THE SWIMMERS,Disdainful laughter welled.
1052,THE SWIMMERS,
1053,THE SWIMMERS,"Then silence, save for cloven wave and wind."
1054,THE SWIMMERS,Our fire had faltered on its little dune.
1055,THE SWIMMERS,"Far out a fog-wall reared, and hid the moon."
1056,THE SWIMMERS,The night lay vast and blind.
1057,THE SWIMMERS,
1058,THE SWIMMERS,"Silent, we waited the assuring morn,"
1059,THE SWIMMERS,Which rose on angered waters. But we set
1060,THE SWIMMERS,"Our hooded prows to sea, and, tempest-wet,"
1061,THE SWIMMERS,Beat up the coast forlorn.
1062,THE SWIMMERS,
1063,THE SWIMMERS,"And no man scorned our tale, for well they knew"
1064,THE SWIMMERS,Had mystery befallen: in our eyes
1065,THE SWIMMERS,Were alien terrors and unknown surmise.
1066,THE SWIMMERS,Men saw the tale was true.
1067,THE SWIMMERS,
1068,THE SWIMMERS,"And no man seeks a refuge on that shore,"
1069,THE SWIMMERS,Tho tempests gather in impelling skies;
1070,THE SWIMMERS,"Unseen, unsolved, unhazarded it lies,"
1071,THE SWIMMERS,Forsaken evermore.
1072,THE SWIMMERS,
1073,THE SWIMMERS,For on those sands immaculate and lone
1074,THE SWIMMERS,"Perchance They list the sea’s immeasured lyre,"
1075,THE SWIMMERS,When sunset casts an evanescent fire
1076,THE SWIMMERS,Thro billows thunder-sown.

1195,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Art not an exile shy,"

1260,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,And isolating waters of the West.
1261,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Deep-channelled by the billows’ rage it lies,"

1277,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,A zone

1282,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Yon clouds, like giants overthrown"
1283,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Sink to the ocean’s western verge,"

1291,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"The music of the gods again,"
1292,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The murmur of their slain
1293,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,And firmamental echo of great wars.
1294,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,See how the wave in sudden anger flings
1295,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,White arms about a rock to drag it down!
1296,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"No siren sings,"
1297,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"But in that pool of crystal gleams her crown,"

1313,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Each elder tree a king
1314,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Whose fame the wordless billows magnify.
1315,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,A thousand winters of achieving storm
1316,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Moulded each mighty form
1317,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,To beauty and to strength:
1318,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,A thousand more shall raven ere they die.
1319,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,
1320,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,But wander to the verge again
1321,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Where the immeasurable main
1322,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Below the red horizon rears its wall,"
1323,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The day’s enormous pyre
1324,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Whence oft, in mighty sunsets of the West,"
1325,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The world seems menaced by invading fire.
1326,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Dost hear no call
1327,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,From these hesperian Islands of the Blest
1328,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,That wait the quest
1329,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Of galleys of adventure, launched at dawn"
1330,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,And seaward on the tides of peril drawn?
1331,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"The sky-line’s crimson harbors seem to hold,"
1332,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"At dusk, their prows of gold."
1333,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Now, ere the stars come out along the wind,"
1334,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The veering sea-birds find
1335,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The refuge that they crave
1336,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,On cliffs above the weedy mouth
1337,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Of some reverberant cave
1338,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,In which the ocean’s monstrous chuckle wakes.
1339,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Fast comes the night;
1340,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The west witholds at last
1341,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Those last red relics of departing light
1342,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,That once were noon.
1343,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Hark how the billow breaks,"
1344,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Forever cast
1345,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,On reefs round which wild waters and the moon
1346,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Weave silver garlands--foamy fillets strewn
1347,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Along her shining pathway to the South!
1348,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"The stars arise,"
1349,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,And westward now the Eagle holds their van.
1350,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"See how the Pleiades,"
1351,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Like hounds in leash before Aldebaran,"
1352,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Strain up the shifting skies!
1353,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"The cypress trees,"
1354,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Drenched in the milk o’ the moon, conspirant seem,"
1355,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"The surf a chant of giants heard afar,"
1356,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,While seaward gleam
1357,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The lamps of Lyra and the evening star....
1358,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,
1359,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The midnight hushes all;
1360,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The winds are dumb;
1361,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Eastward, Orion treads the mountain-wall."
1362,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,But lo! what visitant is on the gloom?
1363,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Beauty and mystery and terror meet
1364,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,At this her chosen seat:
1365,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"The writhing fog is come,"
1366,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,White as the moon’s cold hands
1367,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Laid on a marble tomb.
1368,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Slow swarm the dragon-bands--
1369,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Those pallid monsters of the mist that nose
1370,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The granite bare
1371,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,And glide along the flanks
1372,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Of hill and headland where the cypress ranks
1373,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Are crouched like silent foes,"
1374,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Relentless and aware.
1375,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Far to the sombre hills they roam
1376,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Like winds that have no home,"
1377,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"And creep,"
1378,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Unhasting and intent,"
1379,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Along the muffled deep,"
1380,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,As tho malignly sent
1381,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,From Lethe’s murmur and the starless foam.
1382,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"They pass, and now again the moon is free,"
1383,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Slow pacing with the Signs about her head;
1384,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Soon shall the dawn arise and find her fled
1385,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"From yon blue battlement,"
1386,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,As tho a pearl were hidden by the sea.
1387,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,
1388,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,*       *       *       *       *
1389,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,
1390,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Beauty, what dost thou here?"
1391,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Why hauntest thou the House where Death is lord
1392,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,And o’er thy crown appear
1393,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The inexorable shadow and the sword?
1394,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Art not a mad mirage above a grave?
1395,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The foam foredriven of a perished wave?
1396,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,A clarion afar?
1397,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,A lily on the waters of despond?
1398,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,A ray that leaping from our whitest star
1399,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Shows but the night beyond?
1400,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,And yet thou seemest more than all the rest
1401,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,That eye and ear attest--
1402,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,A watch-tower on the mountains whence we see
1403,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,On future skies
1404,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The rose of dawn to be;
1405,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,The altar of an undiscovered shore;
1406,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,A dim assurance and a proud surmise;
1407,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,A gleam
1408,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Upon the bubble, Time;"
1409,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"The vision, fleet, sublime,"
1410,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Of sorrowed man, the brute that dared to dream."
1411,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Ah! those, and more!"
1412,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Made veritable tho the heart descry
1413,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,No path to thy demesne
1414,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"And Music builds, unseen,"
1415,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Her Heaven we shall not enter tho we die.
1416,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Still must thou speak,"
1417,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"August and consecrate,"
1418,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"Of that Reality we can but seek,"
1419,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Tho seeking fail--
1420,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,"That Sun eternal and inviolate,"
1421,AN ALTAR OF THE WEST,Whereof thou art the portent and the veil.

1428,THE FAUN,
1429,THE FAUN,Now in the noontide peace I lie
1430,THE FAUN,"Where waving grass is green,"
1431,THE FAUN,With bosom open to the sky
1432,THE FAUN,And not a cloud between;
1433,THE FAUN,"At dawn, one cast from out the blue"
1434,THE FAUN,"A shadow on my lanes,"
1435,THE FAUN,Then vanished with the dwindling dew
1436,THE FAUN,And not a wisp remains.
1437,THE FAUN,
1438,THE FAUN,An hour ago I watched an ant
1439,THE FAUN,Haste homeward with her spoil;
1440,THE FAUN,"She had, by Jove his covenant,"
1441,THE FAUN,No quittance of her toil;
1442,THE FAUN,"Doubtless they be a thrifty race,"
1443,THE FAUN,Whose works shall not depart:
1444,THE FAUN,"O Jove, who grantest each his place,"
1445,THE FAUN,Teach not to me their art!
1446,THE FAUN,
1447,THE FAUN,"I and my kin shall pass ere long,"
1448,THE FAUN,And ants shall ever be;
1449,THE FAUN,But better now the linnet’s song
1450,THE FAUN,Than their eternity.
1451,THE FAUN,What tho my people perish soon?
1452,THE FAUN,Awhile the dews we crush
1453,THE FAUN,Where nights of summer mould the moon
1454,THE FAUN,And laughters wake the thrush.
1455,THE FAUN,
1456,THE FAUN,From yonder hill I spy on man
1457,THE FAUN,"And marvel at his need,"
1458,THE FAUN,"Who fashions, in a season’s span,"
1459,THE FAUN,A thousand fanes to Greed;
1460,THE FAUN,"Perchance from each, his worship done,"
1461,THE FAUN,"He ventures forth repaid,"
1462,THE FAUN,But grant thou me the spendthrift sun
1463,THE FAUN,And berries of the glade.
1464,THE FAUN,
1465,THE FAUN,"At noon great Caesar’s chariot past,"
1466,THE FAUN,"A poison on the air,"
1467,THE FAUN,"But drive he slow or drive he fast,"
1468,THE FAUN,The journey’s end is Care--
1469,THE FAUN,"Care, at whose throne all mortals stand"
1470,THE FAUN,"With tinsel crowns put by,"
1471,THE FAUN,"Too weak to rove the billowed land,"
1472,THE FAUN,Too sad to watch the sky.
1473,THE FAUN,
1474,THE FAUN,"Mid ivied trunks I see her gleam,"
1475,THE FAUN,"The nymph, my forest-mate;"
1476,THE FAUN,"She wanders by the lyric stream,"
1477,THE FAUN,To us articulate.
1478,THE FAUN,"A golden house let Caesar build,"
1479,THE FAUN,To hold his ghosts and gods--
1480,THE FAUN,"For me the summer eves are stilled,"
1481,THE FAUN,For me the flower nods.

1510,A CHARACTER,"’Twas seeming only. We, who found his soul"
1511,A CHARACTER,"Thro friendship’s crystal, saw beyond the glass"
1512,A CHARACTER,The elusive seraph. In his mind were met
1513,A CHARACTER,"The faun, the cynic, the philosopher,"
1514,A CHARACTER,"But first of all, the poet. Give to such"
1515,A CHARACTER,"Apollo’s guise, and matters were not well."
1516,A CHARACTER,"Too glad to pose, ofttimes he held his peace"
1517,A CHARACTER,Before the jest that sought his heart; but let
1518,A CHARACTER,"The whim appeal, and all his mind took fire--"

1522,A CHARACTER,Was like a wind some hidden world put forth
1523,A CHARACTER,"To baffle, madden, lure--at times, betray,"
1524,A CHARACTER,Then win him back to worship with a breath
1525,A CHARACTER,Of Edens never trodden. Yet he stood
1526,A CHARACTER,"No dupe to Nature in her harlotry,"

1530,A CHARACTER,Its honey from illusion’s stinging hive--

1537,A CHARACTER,To what best liken him? Some singer must
1538,A CHARACTER,"Have used the star-souled geode’s rind and heart,"
1539,A CHARACTER,Telling of such as he. Let me compare
1540,A CHARACTER,His rugged aspect and auroral mind
1541,A CHARACTER,To that wide shell our western ocean grants--
1542,A CHARACTER,"Without, all harsh and hueless, with, perhaps,"

1713,DUTY,"Indignant, splendid, and the hostile blaze"
1714,DUTY,Of Pain’s effulgence from his hidden ways
1715,DUTY,Seemed but her beacon to a goal divine.
1716,DUTY,
1717,DUTY,"Then fell intensest shadow on her path,"
1718,DUTY,"Whereat one cried, “Behold! the sword of Death!"
1719,DUTY,Shall mortal face unfaltering the Wrath?”
1720,DUTY,And silence held our multitude. But she
1721,DUTY,"Passed on as to a thing of spectral breath,--"
1722,DUTY,A fantasy that was not nor could be.

1728,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,
1729,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,
1730,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,"Now, as the west is red, O birds!"
1731,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,My clumsy arts you bring to naught:
1732,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,"A victim of the curse of thought,"
1733,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,I tell its pain in trammeling words--
1734,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,
1735,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,Your music mocks the bitter lay!
1736,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,Idle as any song of mine
1737,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,The melody from copse or pine--
1738,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,Born at the dying of the day;
1739,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,
1740,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,But oh! the full accomplishment!
1741,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,Reproach unplanned but exquisite!
1742,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,Hark how the unpurchased throats transmit
1743,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,The tidings of a world content!
1744,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,
1745,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,"To you the tale is all of joy,"
1746,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,But we from rapture ask its pang;
1747,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,"And tho’ an angel came and sang,"
1748,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,Our hearts would worship--and destroy.
1749,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,
1750,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,"And tho for ecstasy you sing,"
1751,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,"Our dim dissent awaits your tale,"
1752,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,And in the song there seems to wail
1753,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,Another message than you bring:
1754,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,
1755,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,"Unmastered still by disbelief,"
1756,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,You tell our doubts in twilight strain;
1757,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,"Untouched by man’s perennial pain,"
1758,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,You give some echo of his grief;
1759,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,
1760,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,Or so we dream. The very wind
1761,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,Serves at the soul’s aeolian chords;
1762,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,"Rulers dismayed, uncertain lords,"
1763,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,"In all we find, ourselves we find."
1764,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,
1765,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,But you escape the nets of care.
1766,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,Whither at last my feet shall go
1767,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,I know not: from your song I know
1768,THE ECHO AND THE QUEST,"You find the truth, and find it fair."

1776,JUSTICE,"Nila the youth, first-born, whose father’s name"
1777,JUSTICE,"Was honored in his market-place of Ind,"
1778,JUSTICE,"Loved Unda, and the dreaming twain, betrothed,"
1779,JUSTICE,Waited the springtide and their marriage-rites.
1780,JUSTICE,"The springtide came, but Nila’s joy came not,"
1781,JUSTICE,"For she, the girl that was to be his bride,"
1782,JUSTICE,"Was ravished from her lover, kin and home--"
1783,JUSTICE,Prey to the bull-necked Rajah on the hill.
1784,JUSTICE,"Then Nila, heedless of his father’s hope,"
1785,JUSTICE,Vanished. Anon before the palace gate
1786,JUSTICE,"That looked across the palm-tops to the south,"
1787,JUSTICE,"And whence the road ran eastward to the town,"
1788,JUSTICE,"There sat one cowled, a grey and mournful shape,"
1789,JUSTICE,"Who spoke not, and was deemed, for silence, saint,--"
1790,JUSTICE,"Who lived upon the offerings of the poor,"
1791,JUSTICE,"And gave no sign, nor vision of his face,"
1792,JUSTICE,"To slave nor councillor. “For,” said the youth,"
1793,JUSTICE,“It well may be that on some day she fare
1794,JUSTICE,"Forth to the temple, or to other ends:"
1795,JUSTICE,"And I, shall I not know her as she goes,"
1796,JUSTICE,Tho’ jewelled curtains hide the loyal face?
1797,JUSTICE,Aye! but to be as near to her as now
1798,JUSTICE,And do her service once in all my days
1799,JUSTICE,Were better than despair. Yet if men find
1800,JUSTICE,"That I am Nila, they may well discern"
1801,JUSTICE,"Wherefore I wait, and so the Rajah know,"
1802,JUSTICE,"Or, at the least, my kindred draw me hence.”"
1803,JUSTICE,
1804,JUSTICE,"He waiting, season after season came"
1805,JUSTICE,With weal and woe unto the sons of men--
1806,JUSTICE,"The time of sowing and the time to reap,"
1807,JUSTICE,"Summer, and crashing of the winter rain,"
1808,JUSTICE,"And plague and famine, gods that slew unseen."
1809,JUSTICE,"He heard the stars plot evil unto man,"
1810,JUSTICE,And saw the baleful meteor float to light
1811,JUSTICE,And many suns look down upon man’s pain.
1812,JUSTICE,The days had each their will of him. The years
1813,JUSTICE,"Wrought as with cunning chisels. Gaunt he grew,"
1814,JUSTICE,"A silent watcher by the carven gate,"
1815,JUSTICE,"And saw his kind go in and forth again,"
1816,JUSTICE,"But never one whose coming, with a thrill,"
1817,JUSTICE,Sang to his heart: “Lo! I am even she!”
1818,JUSTICE,"Hooded, unknown, so sat he ’mid the crows--"
1819,JUSTICE,"Sear as the summer, grey as any rain--"
1820,JUSTICE,"And watched the flowers’ birth and death, and heard"
1821,JUSTICE,"The sparrows’ song of mating, or the din"
1822,JUSTICE,Where the shrill apes held council in the grove.
1823,JUSTICE,"Often, in dreams that broke his daytime’s dream,"
1824,JUSTICE,"He somehow, somewhere, found the long-betrothed,"
1825,JUSTICE,"Far-wandered too in sleep’s Elysium,"
1826,JUSTICE,"And clasped her form, and kissed her deathless lips,"
1827,JUSTICE,"Hushed, in some garden of eternal dews;"
1828,JUSTICE,"Then woke to silence and the dark, save where"
1829,JUSTICE,"In one lean tower gleamed a shrouded lamp,"
1830,JUSTICE,"Like some red planet still among the stars,"
1831,JUSTICE,"Or, hung above the temple to the south,"
1832,JUSTICE,The failing lanthorn of the moon ... Far off
1833,JUSTICE,A jackal barked ... A whisper touched the wind.
1834,JUSTICE,
1835,JUSTICE,"So for two score of years his vigil ran,"
1836,JUSTICE,"Unbroken save for slumber, till his hope,"
1837,JUSTICE,"More faint at last, for all his hungering,"
1838,JUSTICE,"Than shadows cast by firstling moons, was fled."
1839,JUSTICE,"But in the dust and detriments of noon,"
1840,JUSTICE,"And in the midnight, still he longed for her,"
1841,JUSTICE,"As, day by day, the marring seasons passed,"
1842,JUSTICE,"Heedless of his despair. And yet he dreamt,"
1843,JUSTICE,Sustained by that which man must find at last--
1844,JUSTICE,"Patience, his answer to the sneer of Hell."
1845,JUSTICE,"Often he whispered prayer, and, in his age,"
1846,JUSTICE,"Spoke unto children and to ancient men,"
1847,JUSTICE,"But craved no word of her he loved, in dread"
1848,JUSTICE,Lest he be told her death. Then broke a day
1849,JUSTICE,Whereon a hush seemed come to mortal things.
1850,JUSTICE,"A scarlet flower opened, near at hand,"
1851,JUSTICE,"Scentless. Far up, he saw a lonely cloud,"
1852,JUSTICE,"Cold-purple, like a bruise upon the sky."
1853,JUSTICE,"A restless wind plucked at the parent dust,"
1854,JUSTICE,And all the apes were silent in the grove.
1855,JUSTICE,"And Nila knew his end was near, and felt"
1856,JUSTICE,His soul rise wearily and welcome Death.
1857,JUSTICE,Then one came forth from out the palace gate--
1858,JUSTICE,"Broken and desolate with foul-eyed age,"
1859,JUSTICE,"And sat near by, nor held at all her peace,"
1860,JUSTICE,Lamenting o’er some matter of a hen.
1861,JUSTICE,"Whereat said Nila: “Woman, hast thou word"
1862,JUSTICE,"Of one whom, long ago, the Rajah tore"
1863,JUSTICE,From lover and from kin--of her whose name
1864,JUSTICE,Was Unda?” Then the crone bent low her head
1865,JUSTICE,"And pondered, reaching back to years agone,"
1866,JUSTICE,As one that in the darkness of the sea
1867,JUSTICE,"Gropes for a sunken gem. At last she spoke,"
1868,JUSTICE,"Saying, “So long! So long ago! And yet"
1869,JUSTICE,"Do I remember Unda, for alone"
1870,JUSTICE,"Of all her band she mourned, nor would be still;"
1871,JUSTICE,Wherefore our lord at last was wroth with her
1872,JUSTICE,"And put her forth, for that she ever wept,"
1873,JUSTICE,"By the northern gate, forbidding that she turn"
1874,JUSTICE,Again unto her kindred. And some say
1875,JUSTICE,"That she within the jungle perished, some"
1876,JUSTICE,That to a city of the west she fared
1877,JUSTICE,And dwelt in shame. Doubtless she long is dead.”
1878,JUSTICE,"And Nila gazed upon the land and sky,"
1879,JUSTICE,"Woven for man’s illusion, and beheld"
1880,JUSTICE,The scarlet petals fallen from their stem.
1881,JUSTICE,The cloud had gone; the wind was fled away.
1882,JUSTICE,"And Nila turned him from the veils of Time,"
1883,JUSTICE,"And bowed his head, and murmured: “God is just.”"

1894,THE FLEET,From merciless horizons cast--
1895,THE FLEET,Annihilation’s breath--
1896,THE FLEET,Thunder no word but “Death!”
1897,THE FLEET,Yea! though the blind sea rave
1898,THE FLEET,"And all its gulfs gape eager as the grave,"
1899,THE FLEET,"Sure of your flesh at last,"
1900,THE FLEET,O human hearts! stand fast!
1901,THE FLEET,"And though untested nerve and sinew shrink,"
1902,THE FLEET,Trapped and astounded at the final brink--
1903,THE FLEET,"Tho’ hostile guns the march to silence toll,"
1904,THE FLEET,"Beyond it lies the goal,"

1909,THE FLEET,And strong to serve the Star
1910,THE FLEET,That past the dusk of war
1911,THE FLEET,Imperishable gleams.
1912,THE FLEET,And O! how little seems
1913,THE FLEET,The price of death men wait so glad to pay
1914,THE FLEET,To hold undesecrated every ray!
1915,THE FLEET,To serve thro’ many nights
1916,THE FLEET,The youngest of the Lights
1917,THE FLEET,Until it burns sublime
1918,THE FLEET,From uncontested heights--
1919,THE FLEET,The whitest beacon on the coasts of Time!
1920,THE FLEET,

1922,THE FLEET,"Beneath the unconquered skies,"

1924,THE FLEET,But mercy in her eyes!
1925,THE FLEET,Behold before her gates
1926,THE FLEET,"That bar the loyal sea,"
1927,THE FLEET,"Foaming upon her threshholds ceaselessly,"
1928,THE FLEET,Each messenger that waits
1929,THE FLEET,Armed for conclusive fates--
1930,THE FLEET,Angels of death made mighty to fulfil
1931,THE FLEET,’Mid thunderings her will!
1932,THE FLEET,"Behold all these and know her wisdom’s length,"
1933,THE FLEET,"Her beauty and her strength,"
1934,THE FLEET,And know that farther skies
1935,THE FLEET,"Age-hence shall see her rise,"
1936,THE FLEET,Hesperus of the high and starry plan
1937,THE FLEET,"When nations sit unarmored at the feast,"
1938,THE FLEET,"Of freedom, West and East,"

1955,REMORSE,"Abidest thou, and in thy stony ears"
1956,REMORSE,The changeless moaning of the ancient deep

2134,WHITE MAGIC,Less clear and delicate than they.
2135,WHITE MAGIC,
2136,WHITE MAGIC,The strain we lost and could not find
2137,WHITE MAGIC,Think we her haunted heart forgets?
2138,WHITE MAGIC,She weaves it with a troubled wind
2139,WHITE MAGIC,And twilight music that regrets.
2140,WHITE MAGIC,
2141,WHITE MAGIC,"Often she stands, unseen, aloof,"
2142,WHITE MAGIC,To watch beside an ocean’s brink
2143,WHITE MAGIC,"The gorgeous, evanescent woof"
2144,WHITE MAGIC,Cast from the loom of suns that sink.
2145,WHITE MAGIC,
2146,WHITE MAGIC,"Often, in eyries of the West,"
2147,WHITE MAGIC,She waits a lover from afar--
2148,WHITE MAGIC,Frailties of blossom on her breast
2149,WHITE MAGIC,And o’er her brow the evening star.
2150,WHITE MAGIC,
2151,WHITE MAGIC,"She stands to greet him unaware,"
2152,WHITE MAGIC,Who cannot find her if he seek:
2153,WHITE MAGIC,"A sigh, a scent of heavenly hair--"
