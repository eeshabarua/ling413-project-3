60,FOREWORD,"A little while since, I had the fortune to live in a house, outside of"
61,FOREWORD,whose windows there grew a pear-tree. On the branches of this tree lived
62,FOREWORD,a green bird of indeterminate nature. I do not know what his real name
63,FOREWORD,"was, but the name, to quote our great exemplar Lewis Carroll, by which"
64,FOREWORD,his name was _called_ was the Grackle. He seemed perfectly willing to
65,FOREWORD,"be addressed thus, and accordingly was."
66,FOREWORD,
67,FOREWORD,"Aside from watching the Pear-Tree and the Grackle, my other principal"
68,FOREWORD,occupation that winter was watching the Poetry Society of America now
69,FOREWORD,and then at its monthly meetings. It occurred to me finally to invite
70,FOREWORD,"such members of it as cared to come, following many good examples, to"
71,FOREWORD,an outdoor symposium under the tree. The result follows.

295,RAMBUNCTO,It was a natural thing enough; my eyes
296,RAMBUNCTO,"Stared baffled down the forest-aisles, brown and green,"
297,RAMBUNCTO,"Not learning what the marks were. Still, who learns?"
298,RAMBUNCTO,"Not I, who stooped and picked the things that day,"
299,RAMBUNCTO,"Scarlet and gold and smooth, friend ... smooth enough!"
300,RAMBUNCTO,"And she's in a vault now, old Jane Fotheringham,"
301,RAMBUNCTO,"My mother-in-law; and my wife's seven aunts,"
302,RAMBUNCTO,And that cursed bird that used to sit and croak
303,RAMBUNCTO,Upon their pear-tree--they threw scraps to him--
304,RAMBUNCTO,"My wife, too. Lord, that was a curious thing!"
305,RAMBUNCTO,"Because--""I don't like mushrooms much,"" I said,"
306,RAMBUNCTO,And they ate all I picked. And then they died.
307,RAMBUNCTO,"But ... Well, who knows it isn't better that way?"
308,RAMBUNCTO,"It's quieter, at least.... Rambuncto--friend--"
309,RAMBUNCTO,"Why, you're not going?... Well--it's a stupid year,"
310,RAMBUNCTO,And the world's very useless.... Sorry.... Still
311,RAMBUNCTO,The dusk intransience that I much prefer
312,RAMBUNCTO,Leaves place for little hope and less regret.
313,RAMBUNCTO,"I don't suppose he'd care, to stay to dine"
