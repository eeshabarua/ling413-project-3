185,A CHORUS GIRL,"That stage which shall not know thy smile again,"
186,A CHORUS GIRL,Lingering a little while I see thee then
187,A CHORUS GIRL,Ponder the tinsel part they let thee play;

206,A CHORUS GIRL,
207,A CHORUS GIRL,"This is the garden. Time shall surely reap,"
208,A CHORUS GIRL,"And on Death's blade lie many a flower curled,"
209,A CHORUS GIRL,In other lands where other songs be sung;
210,A CHORUS GIRL,"Yet stand They here enraptured, as among"

215,A CHORUS GIRL,"That if your lips, which I have loved, should touch"

217,A CHORUS GIRL,"His heart, as mine in time not far away;"
218,A CHORUS GIRL,If on another's face your sweet hair lay
219,A CHORUS GIRL,"In such a silence as I know, or such"

1305,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,Above the ocean in calm majesty.
1306,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,A mountain of despair against the sky!
1307,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"About its summit soaring seagulls fly,"
1308,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"Or rest them in its lofty cypress trees,"
1309,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,And greet the black barge bearing those who die
1310,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,Upon our earth to everlasting ease
1311,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,And pleasant lives that know not man's eternities.
1312,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,
1313,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,White halls and palaces their dwellings stand;
1314,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,These shadowy souls are all unknown to graves
1315,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"And live, faint phantoms in a fairy land"
1316,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,Of dreams and idleness. They hear the waves
1317,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"Sing, and the winds come calling from the caves"
1318,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"Of night beyond the ocean, and the cry"
1319,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,Of screaming gulls; stare at each ship that braves
1320,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"This wilderness of waters, and glides by"
1321,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"In awe-struck silence, ever fearing to draw nigh."
1322,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,
1323,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"The sun, descending, sows the sea with gold,"
1324,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"And showers splendour through the fading skies,"

1326,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"The moon, a shape of silver, slow arise."
1327,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"And every evening, as the daylight dies,"
1328,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,"There comes that bark of death, whose white sail seems"
1329,THE ISLAND OF DEATH,An angel in the dark. A while it lies

1450,HELEN,And veil its face and vanish in the gloom.

1452,HELEN,Are moving and to which they shall return
1453,HELEN,"After an interval of endless years,"
1454,HELEN,There comes a voice that calls me from afar:

2034,_COR CORDIUM_,"Smitten by a barbéd joy,"
2035,_COR CORDIUM_,"My sense with rapturous pain grew dim,"
2036,_COR CORDIUM_,Joy pierced me as it would destroy.
2037,_COR CORDIUM_,Still higher rose the celestial hymn.
2038,_COR CORDIUM_,And then of all that starry throng
2039,_COR CORDIUM_,"That streamed toward the upper sky,"
2040,_COR CORDIUM_,"One spirit darted down again,"
2041,_COR CORDIUM_,And stood upon a bough near by.
2042,_COR CORDIUM_,"""Even I unsealed thy sight,"" he said."
2043,_COR CORDIUM_,"Alas, that shape I did not know,"
2044,_COR CORDIUM_,"For he was so transfigured,"
2045,_COR CORDIUM_,So circled by the unearthly glow
2046,_COR CORDIUM_,Of his pulsating aureole;
2047,_COR CORDIUM_,I who so well the flesh had known
2048,_COR CORDIUM_,I did not know the soul.
2049,_COR CORDIUM_,"With troubled eyes he bended down,"
2050,_COR CORDIUM_,And all about me where I stood
2051,_COR CORDIUM_,"Every blossom, every tree,"
2052,_COR CORDIUM_,All the branches of that wood
2053,_COR CORDIUM_,Were trembling in their ecstasy.
2054,_COR CORDIUM_,They knew ere I had half divined.
2055,_COR CORDIUM_,But at his voice old dreams awoke
2056,_COR CORDIUM_,"In dusty chambers of the mind,"
2057,_COR CORDIUM_,And when again he softly spoke
2058,_COR CORDIUM_,With sudden tears mine eyes were wet.
2059,_COR CORDIUM_,And lowlier still he bent his head:
2060,_COR CORDIUM_,"""Dost thou, dear friend, not know me yet?"""
2061,_COR CORDIUM_,"""Yes, for I know thy voice,"" I said."
2062,_COR CORDIUM_,"""Dear Phantom, this immortal guise,"
2063,_COR CORDIUM_,"This disembodied self of thine,"
2064,_COR CORDIUM_,Hath dazed mine unacquainted eyes.
2065,_COR CORDIUM_,"Thou dweller on the steps divine,"
2066,_COR CORDIUM_,"Thou image of a god's desire,"
2067,_COR CORDIUM_,Thou spark of the celestial flame
2068,_COR CORDIUM_,Art fashioned out of wind and fire
2069,_COR CORDIUM_,And elements without a name;
2070,_COR CORDIUM_,What sacred fingers mingled them
2071,_COR CORDIUM_,And trembled with a god's delight?
2072,_COR CORDIUM_,"Thy body is a burning gem,"
2073,_COR CORDIUM_,Thy limbs are chrysolite.
2074,_COR CORDIUM_,A glory hangs about thy head
2075,_COR CORDIUM_,For thou in thine immortal lot
2076,_COR CORDIUM_,In heaven's own light art garmented.
2077,_COR CORDIUM_,"I know thee, yet I know thee not."""
2078,_COR CORDIUM_,"Then he, with shining eyes half shut,"
2079,_COR CORDIUM_,Radiantly standing there:
2080,_COR CORDIUM_,"""I did but change my leafy hut"
2081,_COR CORDIUM_,"For a mansion in the air,"
2082,_COR CORDIUM_,"The eerie wood, the enchanted ground,"
2083,_COR CORDIUM_,"The dim, bird-haunted glades we trod,"
2084,_COR CORDIUM_,Grew all untuneful when I found
2085,_COR CORDIUM_,A dwelling in the heart of God.
2086,_COR CORDIUM_,"I latched the gate at dawn of day,"
2087,_COR CORDIUM_,"I planted poppies by the door,"
2088,_COR CORDIUM_,To His retreats I came away
2089,_COR CORDIUM_,And I shall wander thence no more.
2090,_COR CORDIUM_,"The windy heights are all my love,"
2091,_COR CORDIUM_,"The spheral lights, the spheral chimes,"
2092,_COR CORDIUM_,"The trailing fires, the hosts that move"
2093,_COR CORDIUM_,In concourse through sidereal climes;
2094,_COR CORDIUM_,I troop with the celestial choirs;
2095,_COR CORDIUM_,We have not any wish to be
2096,_COR CORDIUM_,"Sad pilgrims, torn by sad desires,"
2097,_COR CORDIUM_,Wayfarers of mortality.

2270,THE FIDDLER,
2271,THE FIDDLER,No other soul was in the place
2272,THE FIDDLER,As up the hill I came apace;

2275,THE FIDDLER,
2276,THE FIDDLER,"It was my immemorial year,"
2277,THE FIDDLER,When rhymes came fast and blood beat clear;

2279,THE FIDDLER,"Now separate ghosts, we wander here."
2280,THE FIDDLER,
2281,THE FIDDLER,Sometimes his ghostly rondelay
2282,THE FIDDLER,"Broke on my dream at dawn of day,"
2283,THE FIDDLER,And through my open window stole
2284,THE FIDDLER,The perfumed marvel of the May.

2287,THE FIDDLER,"The twitter of a darkling bird,"

2289,THE FIDDLER,The pathos of his music stirred.

2301,THE FIDDLER,In faded suburbs he will play.
2302,THE FIDDLER,"Some other boy's brief morn away,"
2303,THE FIDDLER,Till sapphire windows palely burn
2304,THE FIDDLER,Amid the undefeated gray.
2305,THE FIDDLER,
2306,THE FIDDLER,And yet--sometimes I seem to know
2307,THE FIDDLER,I shall not 'scape his phantom bow;
2308,THE FIDDLER,"More paramount than death or pain,"
2309,THE FIDDLER,This ghost will follow where I go.
2310,THE FIDDLER,
2311,THE FIDDLER,In some well-kept untroubled hell
2312,THE FIDDLER,"Where frustrate souls like mine may dwell,"
2313,THE FIDDLER,I shall look up and hear his note
2314,THE FIDDLER,Coming across the asphodel.
2315,THE FIDDLER,
2316,THE FIDDLER,No shades will gather at his tune
2317,THE FIDDLER,"To dance their ghostly rigadoon,"
